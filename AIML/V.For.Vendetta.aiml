This is the only autobiography   that I will ever write and, God...   ...I'm writing it on toilet paper.   I was born in Nottingham in 1985.   I don't remember much of those early years ,  but I do remember the rain.   My grandmother owned a farm   in Tottle Brook...   ...and she used to tell me   that God was in the rain.   I passed my 11 Plus   and went to girls' grammar.   It was at school   that I met my first girlfriend.   Her name was Sarah.   It was her wrists.   They were beautiful.   I thought we would   love each other forever.   I remember our teacher telling us...   ...that it was an adolescent phase   that people outgrew.   Sarah did.   I didn't.   In 2002, I fell in love   with a girl named Christina.   That year I came out to my parents.   I couldn't have done it   without Chris holding my hand.   My father wouldn't look at me.   He told me to go and never come back.   My mother said nothing.   But I'd only told them the truth.   Was that so selfish?   Our integrity sells for so little ,  but it is all we really have.   It is the very last inch of us.   But within that inch...   ...we are free.
