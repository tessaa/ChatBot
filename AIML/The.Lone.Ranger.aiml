He brought them to his village to be healed.   When they found silver in the river,   they asked the boy where it came from.   In exchange for a cheap pocket watch   from Sears Roebuck,   the boy showed them where the river begins,   where they found more silver   than any white man had ever seen.   They took what they could carry,   but they wanted to keep the place a secret,   so they could one day return.   The boy could not live with what he had done,   so he decided the men were possessed   by evil spirits in the silver.   He called it  windigo,    like the ghost stories we tell our children.   And he made a vow.   When he found these two men,   he would drain their blood   into the soil of his ancestors,   so he could return to the tribe.  But he is too late.</template></category><category><pattern>THERE'S NOTHING HOLDING YOU HERE ANY MORE</pattern><template>It's my home.</template></category><category><pattern>DON'T TELL ME</pattern><template>You boxed in law school.</template></category><category><pattern>AN EVIL SPIRIT BORN IN THE EMPTY SPACES OF THE DESERT</pattern><template>With a hunger that cannot be satisfied.</template></category><category><pattern>MIGHT WANT TO KEEP THAT TO YOURSELF  KEMOSABE</pattern><template>Great shot!</template></category><category><pattern>AS A MATTER OF FACT  I DID</pattern><template>Where is girl?</template></category><category><pattern>A LONE RANGER</pattern><template>Rangers are dead.</template></category><category><pattern>THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE</pattern><template>Train track.</template></category><category><pattern>REBECCA AND DANNY  WHERE ARE THEY</pattern><template>Comanche don't take no prisoners.</template></category><category><pattern>YOU TAKE SOMETHING FROM ME  BE DAMN SURE I'M GONNA TAKE SOMETHING FROM YOU</pattern><template>Oh, yes!</template></category><category><pattern>KEMOSABE   YEAH  ABOUT THAT</pattern><template>Look, I was thinking, if we're gonna be outlaws, I'm gonna need a better name.</template></category><category><pattern>SHALL WE GATHER AT THE RIVER   WHERE BRIGHT ANGEL FEET HAVE TROD   WITH ITS CRYSTAL TIDE FOREVER     IT'S ALMOST HANGING TIME  BUTCH</pattern><template>Do you hear what I said, boy?</template></category><category><pattern>I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE DONE FOR ME</pattern><template>But I should get back.</template></category><category><pattern>LAST TIME I SAW YOUR HUSBAND  HE WAS DROWNING IN HIS OWN BLOOD</pattern><template>We got company.</template></category><category><pattern>AND WOULD YOU STOP FEEDING THAT BIRD</pattern><template>It's not alive, you know.</template></category><category><pattern>THAT'S VERY HELPFUL  THANK YOU</pattern><template>Whoa.</template></category><category><pattern>YES  SIR</pattern><template>Pleasure to see you, Red!</template></category><category><pattern>YOU THINK I WAITED 20 YEARS   FOR SCRAPS</pattern><template>I'm taking all of it!</template></category><category><pattern>WE GOT COMPANY</pattern><template>Hold up!</template></category><category><pattern>THAT'S MY BROTHER'S WIFE</pattern><template>When you were on the other side, you spoke of her in your vision.</template></category><category><pattern>YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND</pattern><template>Because I am a savage?</template></category><category><pattern>HE DESERVES A TRIAL  DAN</pattern><template>Two Rangers are dead.</template></category><category><pattern>PLEASE  THIS IS A MISTAKE</pattern><template>There doesn't need to be a war.</template></category><category><pattern>YOUR HAND  JOHN  GIVE ME YOUR HAND</pattern><template>No. No!</template></category><category><pattern>OH  MY   WHAT WAS THAT</pattern><template>Tunnelling for supply routes.</template></category><category><pattern>I KILLED HIM ONCE</pattern><template>I won't have to answer for it when I kill him again.</template></category><category><pattern>WHAT THE HELL IS HE TALKING ABOUT</pattern><template>Nothing.
