Well, the irony of this is that this money,   which is in the billions,   is coming from your country.   You are the major purchaser of our national product,   which is cocaine.   font color= #804040  INTERVIEWER:   On one hand, you're saying the U. S. government   is spending millions to eliminate   the flow of drugs onto our streets.   At the same time,   we are doing business with the same government   that is flooding our streets with cocaine.   Let me show you a few of the other characters   that are involved in this tragic comedy.   My organization just recently traced   a large purchase by this man.   This charming face here belongs to General Cucombre.   He is the Minister of the Defense of Bolivia, my country.   And General Cucombre just a couple months ago   bought a $12 million villa on Lake Lucerne in Switzerland.   Now, if Cucombre is supposed to be   the Bolivian Defense Minister,   what is he doing living in Switzerland?   Guarding cash registers?   This man here, Alejandro Sosa,   a very interesting character.   He's a wealthy landowner,   educated in England, very good family.   But this man is the business brain and drug overlord   of an empire that stretches across the Andes.   He's not your ordinary drug dealer.   font color= #804040  INTERVIEWER:   Well, discussing it openly...   font color= #808080  (SWITCHES OFF TV)  He's scheduled for 60 Minutes next.</template></category><category><pattern>JUST BE QUIET  JUST HANG BACK</pattern><template>Romeo!</template></category><category><pattern>FONT COLOR= #804040  ANGEL:  SURE THING</pattern><template>font color= #808080  (GREETING IN SPANISH)   font color= #808080  (SPEAKING SPANISH)  Okay.
