And now, as you say, Peter, you're quite right.   They've been jolted apart again, as they were...   seeming to come just a little closer. Little hope.   We've just gotten the final word. When I was a kid...   my father used to say our greatest hopes and our worst fears...   are seldom realized. Our worst fears have been realized tonight.   They've now said that there were 11 hostages.   Two were killed in their rooms...   yesterday morning.   Nine were killed at the airport tonight.   They're all gone.   ...before a quiet crowd of 80,000.   After the ceremony, the surviving team...   saw the coffins of their fallen comrades...   loaded onto an airplane to bring them home together.   Enormous crowds also gathered on Dizengoff Street...   and in Jerusalem on the plaza in front of the Knesset.   People are weeping, tearing their clothes.   The funerals, which will be held tomorrow in Jerusalem...   are expected to draw tens of thousands of mourners.   These are the names of the members of the Israeli team...   at the Munich Olympics, who were held hostage...   beaten, and finally murdered by Arab terrorists.   Yosef Gottfreund.
