Relax, it's seltzer.   Hello.   I'm Shiva the destroyer   and your harbinger of doom   for this evening.   I would like to thank you all   for coming and welcome you.   Even though I haven't seen   most of you since my latest   stretch in the big house.   But you all look fabulous.   So during the 20 minutes or so   that I was not in the hole for   making a shiv out   of my toothbrush,   I actually did participate   in the infamous   12 step program.   Twelve steps.   Step ball change.   Step ball change.   Still waiting for   the change part.   So... But, you know,   as they say,   the relapse is   an almost inevitable   part of recovery.   So I get high marks   in that mode.   Anywho.   I... Well, as more   of you know than are likely to admit,   one of the steps,   actual steps,   is about making amends.   So, I did a lot of   apologizing to people.   Some of whom   barely remembered me,   most of whom barely   remembered anything.   And I apologized for,   you know, like,   bouncing a check,   or passing out   in their bathtub or flooding their   house and, you know,   just basically for involving them in   sordid activities that   they were desperately   trying to forget. I   had to call this   one girl who was, I think, 14,   but she couldn't   come to the phone   actually because   her mom had taken out   a restraining order, but...   But anyway...   So I spent a lot   of time... The point is,   I spent a lot of time   apologizing to people   who were pretty much   perfect strangers.   So, I would very much   like to take this opportunity   to not only congratulate   my extraordinary sister,   the future explorer   in matters of the mind,   thank you very much,   and her adorable,   impending husband   on the occasion of their   unprecedented nuptials,   but also, to apologize to said   extraordinary sister,   future explorer in   matters of the mind, for   what? I don't know.   Everything.   And I really mean   that, Rach. You've...    I've been a nightmare,   you've been a saint,   and I'm really   just so damn glad   to be here with you   and Sidney's family   and our family and just...   Everyone's together   and I'm just...   It's really great.   So I am hereby   raising my seltzer   to my laudatory sister   and herewith   making amends.   Sidney, you are robbing   our dysfunctional family   of one of its most   vital ingredients,   and its only member   still willing to lend me money.   So, boo on you.    That's not true.   Anyway, enjoy Hawaii.   L'chaim.   L'chaim.   One, two, one, two.   Yo, Sidney, who I met hanging out   in Kingston, Jamaica,   while we were   at House of Leo,   and Stone Love was   playing that night.   Those big speakers pounding,   all that Jamaican dub was pumping,   clouds of those   medicinal herbs were floating.   Man. Was a lot   of fun, my man.   It was great meeting you,   hanging out with you,   becoming friends with you,   seeing all the amazing things   that you're doing musically.   All I want to say   to you guys is,   may you both   live to be 100.   And me, 100,   but minus a day,   so I'll never know   beautiful people like   you have passed away.   Do your thing, baby.
