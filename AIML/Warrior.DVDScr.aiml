But the reason a lot of his fans are in the stands is because of another video,   which is even more stunning than the Mad Dog Grimes video.   Let me describe it for you folks for the few who haven�t seen it,    but Tommy Riordan ripped the door off a tank   in the heat of battle, saving lives in the process,   and then walked away without claiming a medal.

Very unorthodox trainer,   and one of the best trainer in the game.    He�s well known for using classical music to train his fighters to remain calm,    to remain patient, and to remain composed under pressure.    Classical music is about as fitting to this setting as Brendan Conlon is to this tournament.    In fact, let me show you something.    That my friend, is Brendan Conlon.   Brendan Conlon is about to get dropped into a shark tank.     He�s a feeder fish.   C�mon, give the guy a break.

Great show of sportsmanship from the teacher.    That�s a hallmark of Frank Campana�s philosophy right there.   Midnight Le is shocked.    He thought he had a free pass into the second round, but instead he�s going home.    He dominated the fight the entire way, but fell prey to a very technical finish.    Very technical finish, but come on, that�s a fluke.    You call it a fluke.    I call it a guy maintaining composure and waiting for his opportunity.   Conlon beats Midnight!    Unbelievable!!!
