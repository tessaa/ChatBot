She pointed her little finger...   ... with her beautiful, soft,   chubby little arm...   ... and her cheeks.   It's like she'd been   looking at it for months...   ... and couldn't get it out,   but knowing what it was.   She didn't look away or anything.   She was just sitting   there with her arm out.   You should've seen   Matthew and Katie and me.   Our jaws just dropped.   We must've stood there for three or   four minutes and just looked at her.   She just had her arm out   like that.  Ball.    And, you know, her little   lips wrapped around it.   It was great.   It was intense.
