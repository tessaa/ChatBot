The following day his review appears.   In many ways, the work of a critic is easy.   We risk very little, yet enjoy a position over those   who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment.   We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read.   But the bitter truth we critics must face is that in the grand scheme of things,   the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful   than our criticism designating it so.   But there are times when a critic truly risks something   and that is in the discovery and defense of the new.   The world is often unkind to new talent, new creations.   The new needs friends.   Last night, I experienced something new,   an extraordinary meal from a singularly unexpected source.   To say that both the meal and its maker   have challenged my preconceptions about fine cooking   is a gross understatement.   They have rocked me to my core.   In the past, I have made no secret of my disdain   for Chef Gusteau's famous motto,  Anyone can cook.    But I realize only now do I truly understand what he meant.   Not everyone can become a great artist,   but a great artist can come from anywhere.   It is difficult to imagine more humble origins   than those of the genius now cooking at Gusteau's,   who is, in this critic's opinion,   nothing less than the finest chef in France.   I will be returning to Gusteau's soon, hungry for more.   I will be returning to Gusteau's soon, hungry for more.   It was a great night.   The happiest of my life.   But the only thing predictable about life is its unpredictability.   Well, we had to let Skinner and the health inspector loose,   and of course they ratted us out.   The food didn't matter.   Once it got out there were rats in the kitchen,   oh, man, the restaurant was closed  and Ego lost his job and his credibility.</template></category><category><pattern>YOU COULD FILL A BOOK  A LOT OF BOOKS  WITH THINGS DAD DOESN'T KNOW</pattern><template>And they have, which is why I read.</template></category><category><pattern>AND HE'S GOING TO ORDER SOMETHING</pattern><template>Something from our menu.</template></category><category><pattern>AM I SEEING THINGS  AM I CRAZY</pattern><template>Is there a phantom rat or is there not?</template></category><category><pattern>BUT ONLY THE FEARLESS CAN BE GREAT   PURE POETRY</pattern><template>But it was not to last.   Gusteau's restaurant lost one of its five stars   after a scathing review by France's top food critic, Anton Ego.   It was a severe blow to Gusteau,   and the brokenhearted chef died shortly afterwards,   which, according to tradition, meant the loss of another star.
