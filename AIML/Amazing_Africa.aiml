African buffalowhich was killed by the hyenas.This gruesome and bloody sightis common in the wilds of Africa.Scavenger birds like the marabouand vultures congregateat the top of this tree,waiting their turn to grab some meat.These marabou are primarily wading birds,but are never ones to turn down a free meal.Scavenging takes far less effortand expends far less energy,so most animals will takethe opportunity if it arises.This hyena tries his bestto fend the vultures off,knowing they will quickly eat his food.The vultures are persistent though.It'll take more than thatto scare them away from a meal.The vultures' determinationeventually pays offand while the hyenas are busy tucking in,the vultures make their moveand swarm on the carcass.Although the marabousare taller than the vultures,they can't match them in terms ofaggression and forcefulnessand are forced to watch from the sidelines.The savanna is quietin the baking afternoon sun.The wildebeests are still migrating.These are blue wildebeestsand they are making the long,exhausting migrationacross land during the dry seasonin order to find fresh grass for feeding.During this migration wildebeests can bevery vulnerable to predatorssuch as leopards, cheetahs, spotted hyenas,and the wily Nile crocodile.Wildebeests tend togroup together in large herdswhen the chances of beingattacked by a predator are high.This herd is already spottedby a leopard high in the trees.It has noticed that one of the wildebeestshas an injured leg.This will make it far easierfor her to catch and kill the animal.Her demeanour changesalmost instantly from that of a lazy catto that of a highly motivatedand skilled killer.She quickly climbs down from herlookout post and into the undergrowth.The leopard moves swiftly and efficiently,treading gently to avoid making noise.She is keeping a low profile to avoidany attention from the wildebeests.The vultures know what is about to happenand amass in the hope of a free meal.She makes sure to stay in the long grass,using her camouflaged furto maximum effect.She pounces instantly and goes straightfor the wildebeest's neck.Her jaws clamp shutaround the wildebeest's windpipein order to suffocate the animal.The vultures have watchedthe entire violent episodeand know that a meal is well on its way.The leopard finishes the hunt by carryingthe wildebeest into the long grassto hide it from scavengersand other predators.Leopards like to store their kills awayso that they can eat themover an extended period.Sometimes they will haveseveral stored at onceand will feed between them.Leopards have to make surethat these carcassesare extremely well hidden,or as we've just seen,there are countless scavengersin this habitathungry and willingto eat anything they can find.The elephants have been forcedto move on from the water holeto the barren and dry plainsin order to graze on grassand other vegetative matter.An adult African elephanteats between 100 and 150 kilogramsof food every dayand spends around three quarters of its time,day and night, eating.This one uses her trunkwhich is incredibly dexterousto pull grass from the groundand into her mouth.   Elephants' tusks serve multiple purposes.</template></category><category><pattern>AND THIS IS FORTUNATE FOR HER AND HER FAMILY BECAUSE GIRAFFES NEED TO EAT A LOTAND GRAZE NOT ONLY ON THE LEAVES BUT ALSO TWIGSBECAUSE THEY CONTAINMORE CALCIUM AND PROTEINWHICH GIRAFFES NEED TOSUSTAIN THEIR RATE OF GROWTH SHE ALSO LIKES TO EAT GRASS  SHRUBS AND FRUIT IN ALL  GIRAFFES ARE HUNGRY ANIMALS EATING AROUND 34 KILOGRAMSOF FOLIAGE EVERY DAY GIRAFFES DIGEST LEAVES AND THE OTHER FOLIAGETHEY EAT IN A SIMILAR WAY TO COWS THEY LIKE TO CHEW THE FOOD UP SWALLOW IT TO HELP PARTIALLY DIGEST ITBEFORE PASSING IT BACK INTO THE MOUTHFOR MORE CHEWING TO SATISFY THEIR MASSIVE APPETITE THE FAMILY ARE MOVING ONTO THE NEXT SET OF TREES BUT THERE ARE MORE GREAT ANIMALSTO EXPLORE IN AFRICA HERE WE SEE A NEW ADDITIONTO AN ELEPHANT HERD THIS YOUNG ELEPHANT IS ABOUT TWO WEEKS OLD LIKE ZEBRA FOALS  BABY ELEPHANTS ARE ABLETO STAND AND WALK ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THIS IS TO GIVE THEM A BETTER CHANCEAGAINST PREDATORSAND BECAUSE ELEPHANTSTEND TO TRAVEL LARGE DISTANCES SO THIS YOUNGSTER WON'T HOLDTHE HERD UP TOO MUCH THE ALLOPARENTS GUIDE THEIR YOUNG CHARGESTO THE NEXT WATERING HOLE ELEPHANTS ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON WATERAND MOST OF THEIR LIVES ARE SPENT EITHERAT A WATERING HOLE  OR IN SEARCH OF ANOTHER IN ADDITION  ELEPHANTS COOL THEMSELVES DOWNBY FLAPPING THEIR EARS BECAUSE IT IS SO HOT IN THE SAVANNA ELEPHANTS HAVE DEVELOPED LARGE EAR SURFACES LET'S JOIN THEM TAKING THEIR MORNING BATH THE LONG LIVING ELEPHANTS HAVE LARGE BRAINSAND ARE HIGHLY INTELLIGENT HENCE THE EXPRESSION AN ELEPHANT NEVER FORGETS  THE LIVES OF MALE AND FEMALE ELEPHANTSARE VERY DIFFERENT THE FEMALES FORM STRONG BONDS WITHONE ANOTHER AND NURTURE THEIR OFFSPRING WHILE THE MALES TEND TOSPEND THEIR TIME INDEPENDENTLY SOMETIMES THEY EVEN LEAVE THEIR GROUPAND JOIN ANOTHER GROUP OF ELEPHANTS THIS ELEPHANT HAS LEFT THE WATER WITH A NICECOATING OF MUD ON HER NECK SHE KNOWS THAT MUD PROTECTS HERFROM THE SUNAND ALSO ACTS AS AN INSECT REPELLENT AS THE DAY WEARS ON IN THE LONG GRASS OF THE SAVANNADIFFERENT SPECIES MOVE UNINTERRUPTED HERE WE SEE A CHEETAH ONE OF THE FASTEST ANIMALS IN THE WORLD CHEETAHS CAN REACH SPEEDSOF UP TO 75 MILES PER HOUR THIS CHEETAH SPENDS MOST OF HER DAY RESTINGAND SHELTERING FROM THE HOT AFRICAN SUN BUT UNLIKE MOST CATS OF AFRICA SHE PREFERS TO HUNT IN THE DAYTIME  TOO AS YOU CAN SEE  THE CHEETAHIS AN ANIMAL BUILT FOR SPEED SHE HAS A LONG  SLENDER BODY WHICH IS EXTREMELY LIGHTFOR AN ANIMAL OF HER SIZE SHE ALSO HAS LONG LEGS  A FLEXIBLE SPINEAND A VERY LONG TAIL TO HELP HER BALANCEAS SHE IS CHASING HER PREY WITNESSING A SUNRISE ON THE SAVANNAMUST BE ONE OF THE MOSTGLORIOUS SPECTACLES ON EARTH AS THE SUNLIGHT CREEPSACROSS THE GRASSLANDS WE BECOME AWARE OF ALL THE WILDLIFEAWAKENING TO ANOTHER EXCITING DAY ONE ANIMAL IS ALWAYS UP EARLY IT'S THE SPOTTED HYENA IN THE SEARCH FOR FOOD MOST PEOPLE THINK HYENASARE ONLY SCAVENGERS WHO FEED ON THE REMAINS OF ANIMALSKILLED BY OTHER PREDATORSSUCH AS THE CHEETAH OR THE LEOPARD HOWEVER WE HAVE RECENTLY FOUND OUTTHAT SPOTTED HYENASACTUALLY KILL AS MUCH AS 95%OF THE FOOD THEY EAT THEMSELVES HYENAS CAN BE QUITE FEROCIOUS ANIMALSAND HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO FIGHT OFF LEOPARDSAND SOMETIMES EVEN LIONESSESIN ORDER TO PROTECT THEIR FOOD HYENAS HAVE EVEN BEEN KNOWNTO ATTACK HUMANS    THESE ARE SPOTTED HYENA</pattern><template>﻿1NARRATOR'. Africa.This great, sprawling wildernessis home to some of the planet's rarestand most fascinating animals.Some of these species are peacefuland live closely with one another,while others are aggressiveand frightening predatorswho strike fear into the heartsof the continent's wildlife.We're going to followsome of these incredible animalsand see how they survivein this sometimes barrenand unforgiving landscape.We will also witnessthe hardships they encounterand the relationships they build.Some animals herehave learned to adapt to survivein strange and unusual ways.Others have to make great migrationsacross the continentin search of food and water.Certain species build closefamily bonds which last a lifetime,utilising teamworkand companionship to survive.But others survive using aggression,power and instinct.Some survive simplyby taking what they can.This is an ecosystemof diversity and contrastwhich supportssome truly amazing characters.The challenges which this landscapepresents to some animalshas led to many astonishingevolutionary adaptationsand highly specialised behaviour.Land like this, known as savanna,covers 20% of the globe.Yet it is a land typewe know surprisingly little about.Water, the supporter of lifeand the habitat for many of Africa's animals.But possibly the most surprisingthing about Africais the incredible strugglesthese animals have to endureto reach water and stay alive.Dozens of different speciesembark on continuous,arduous journeys around the savanna,travelling from water source to water sourcesimply to survive.Nowhere on the globe is sucha massive journey embarked onby such a vast amount of animals.And nowhere on Earthis the migration more dangerous.With predators around every corner,and danger even lurking in the one thingthat keeps them alive,it is no wonder that so many animalsperish along the way.To put this great migration into context,let's look at a typical migration patternof the wildebeests over one year.Travelling great distancesfor months on end,these animals continually circlethe Serengeti National Park.Moving to and from each water source.They have to continually keep travelling.In a way, these animalsact as nature's calendar,turning up at a different spot each month.So these wildebeests truly arenature's greatest travellers.But when these great travellersare joined by the zebras,they become one of the mostimpressive sights ever seen in nature.But along the way the wildebeests passdifferent African animals, like the hippos.Although they may look peaceful,hippos are one of Africa's most aggressiveand unpredictable animals.The yawn they often displayis actually a form of intimidation.Hippos like to group together in podswhich can contain up to 100 hippos.These pods are usually ledby one dominant male.A fully grown adultcan weigh up to three tonsand can run up to 18 miles per hour.An adult hippopotamus can hold its breathfor up to 20 minutes,swimming or walking along the riverbedin order to avoid danger.The name  hippopotamus ,or  hippo  for short,is derived fromthe ancient Greek for  river horse .Hippos spend a lot of time in the water,but also can spend months on endout of the water, in the bush.After passing most of their dayin or around water,these hippos will move inland at nightto graze on short grass.To most animalsthis ferociously flowing riverwould be incredibly dangerous,but hippos are completely at home here.From water to landhere in Africa we can find some ofthe most fascinating animals of our planet,like the leopard.Leopards are mysteriousand graceful creatures,and live most of their lives alone.She likes to hunt at night to stay hiddenand to avoid the heat of the day.The leopard stalks her territoryslowly and stealthily,using her patterned fur for camouflageso she can get as closeto a prey as possible before pouncing.Let's follow her for a while as shesearches for her dinner in the undergrowth.These unsuspecting birds haven't realisedthat the leopard is watching them.She is too tired to hunt themin the heat of the day.She prefers to rest.So, these helmeted guinea fowlcan wander further into the savannaand pay a visit to the zebra family.The zebra spends most of her day grazing.She may look lonely herebut she is in fact part of a big group.Here are the zebra's family and friends.They like to stay togetherbecause unlike the crocodileand the leopard,they are very vulnerable.Like many animals living on the savanna,zebras are very dependenton water and grassand spend a lot of their time migratingto make sure they are alwaysnear a source of quality food.They're at their happiest when they havea good place to cool off and have a drink,but they often forget that crocodilesare always vigilantly watching them.Zebras are closely related to horses.They are large single hoofed ungulates,built for speed and long distance migrations.Zebras typically stand about47 to 55 inches at the shoulder.This black rhino is still roamingthe plains alone, in search of drinking water.Even though he is well adaptedto dry conditions,he needs to find some water soon.His sharp horns may look scary,but he is in fact an herbivoregrazing on twigs, branchesand other plant life instead of eating meat.Rhinos are only aggressiveif they are disturbed.But they have been killedby humans for centuriesas their horns are very valuable.This makes them one ofthe most endangered species on the planet.Another herbivorewho calls the savanna homeis the gravity defying giraffe.Giraffes are the tallestliving mammals on Earth,growing to a whopping height of 20 feet.Although giraffes tend to spend a lotof their time in groups,they don't actually havemuch of a bond with other giraffes.Here we see a giraffegrazing on the leaves of an acacia.Her neck alone is two metres longand has evolved over millions of yearsso that she can reachthe leaves on the tallest trees.The giraffe's large, bulging eyesgive it a wide, panoramic field of vision,making them good at spotting predators.As well as their incredibly long necks,giraffes also have tongueswhich can grow to 50 centimetres in length.Like a human's fingerprint,each giraffe has its ownindividual fur pattern.These complex patternsgive the giraffe camouflagemaking them harder for predators to see.As you can see there is no shortage of food in this area.</template></category><category><pattern>(SCREAMING)THESE OPPORTUNISTIC SCAVENGERSHAVE SWARMED TO THE SITE OF A KILLTO TRY AND STEAL SOME FREE FOOD THE VICTIM IS THE AFRICAN BUFFALOWHICH WAS

with.This romantic landscapeappears peaceful and quiet.But this is deceiving,because this lionessis watching out for suitable prey.What she doesn't knowis that her perfect meal is just over the hill.These African buffalo are quite slowand not very intelligent,meaning they can be easily huntedby predators like lions.All the wildlife at this waterholeare taking advantage of the cooling mud,oblivious to all the dangerslurking in the surrounding savanna.Finally, the lion spots the buffaloas they move away from the waterhole.The buffalo slowly proceed on their way,but one or two of them seem nervous.They might sensesomething is watching them.African buffalo have what is calleda symbiotic relationship with small birds.The buffalo offers food for the birdsin the form of bugs,while receiving a cleaning service.Suddenly, the lion and her sisterspring into actionand give chase to the large herd of buffalo.The buffalo could probablyovercome the lions if they would co operate.This time, though, they escape.Lions are very sociable animalsand live together in prides.Apart from hunting and grooming each other,they spend a lot of the day resting.This is mostly to conserve energyand in order to stay hidden.Lions grow up together and formextremely close family and friendship bonds.Today, the sisters failed to bringany food back to the pride.So this lion might have to waita long time for his next meal.But Africa hasmore fascinating animals to offer,like these baboons.These chacmas baboons like to roamaround the savanna in groupsforaging for food.With these baboons,the social standing of a memberplays a large part in foraging decisions.The most dominant members,usually alpha males,lead the rest of group and decide aboutwhere to go in order to find food.This youngster is enjoying a free rideon his mother's back.Once these baboons arrive at a good site,they will displaycollective foraging behaviourin order to eat similar amountsof food as each other.Chacmas baboonslive in large social groups called troops.Within a troop, male and female baboonsmight form what arereferred to as  friendships .Let's observe these little baboonsinteracting with each otherclimbing on an old tree,like children at a playground.Blissfully unaware in their innocent playthe monkeys are almost able to forgetthat in the savanna there isalways something eerily watching you.This ominous circling of birdscan mean only one thing.

on the leaves,but also twigsbecause they containmore calcium and proteinwhich giraffes need tosustain their rate of growth.She also likes to eat grass, shrubs and fruit.In all, giraffes are hungry animals,eating around 34 kilogramsof foliage every day.Giraffes digest leaves and the other foliagethey eat in a similar way to cows.They like to chew the food up,swallow it to help partially digest itbefore passing it back into the mouthfor more chewing.To satisfy their massive appetite,the family are moving onto the next set of trees.But there are more great animalsto explore in Africa.Here we see a new additionto an elephant herd.This young elephant is about two weeks old.Like zebra foals, baby elephants are ableto stand and walk almost immediately.This is to give them a better chanceagainst predatorsand because elephantstend to travel large distances,so this youngster won't holdthe herd up too much.The alloparents guide their young chargesto the next watering hole.Elephants are highly dependent on waterand most of their lives are spent eitherat a watering hole, or in search of another.In addition, elephants cool themselves downby flapping their ears.Because it is so hot in the savanna,elephants have developed large ear surfaces.Let's join them taking their morning bath.The long living elephants have large brainsand are highly intelligent,hence the expression An elephant never forgets .The lives of male and female elephantsare very different.The females form strong bonds withone another and nurture their offspring,while the males tend tospend their time independently.Sometimes they even leave their groupand join another group of elephants.This elephant has left the water with a nicecoating of mud on her neck.She knows that mud protects herfrom the sunand also acts as an insect repellent.As the day wears on,in the long grass of the savannadifferent species move uninterrupted.Here we see a cheetah,one of the fastest animals in the world.Cheetahs can reach speedsof up to 75 miles per hour.This cheetah spends most of her day restingand sheltering from the hot African sun.But unlike most cats of Africa,she prefers to hunt in the daytime, too.As you can see, the cheetahis an animal built for speed.She has a long, slender body,which is extremely lightfor an animal of her size.She also has long legs, a flexible spineand a very long tail to help her balanceas she is chasing her prey.Witnessing a sunrise on the savannamust be one of the mostglorious spectacles on Earth.As the sunlight creepsacross the grasslands,we become aware of all the wildlifeawakening to another exciting day.One animal is always up early,it's the spotted hyena in the search for food.Most people think hyenasare only scavengers,who feed on the remains of animalskilled by other predatorssuch as the cheetah or the leopard.However we have recently found outthat spotted hyenasactually kill as much as 95%of the food they eat themselves.Hyenas can be quite ferocious animalsand have been known to fight off leopardsand sometimes even lionessesin order to protect their food.Hyenas have even been knownto attack humans.   These are spotted hyena.</template></category></AIML>
