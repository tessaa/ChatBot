The reason?  Fingers are pointed at rookie director Damien Cockburn, who, insiders say, can't control a star studded cast,  including flatulent star of the popular  Fatties  franchise, Jeff Portnoy.   Let me tell you something.   A lot of people are disrespecting me.   They say that the movie's   just about farts. It's about family,   and... you! You can't do what I do.   Fresh from his most recent arrest   for heroin, glue and crack possession,   Portnoy was almost uninsurable.   Also in the mix is Booty Sweat hocking   hip hop hyphenate Alpa Chino.

Drink Booty Sweat.   But the real heavyweight on the set   is five time Academy Award winner   Kirk Lazarus.   The brilliant Australian   known for his bad boy antics off screen   is famous for his total immersion   into any role he portrays.   Well, being an actor is no different   than being a rugby player   or a construction worker,   save for the fact that my tools   are the mechanisms   that trigger human emotion.   Lazarus underwent a controversial   pigmentation alteration procedure   in order to play   the platoon's African American   sergeant, Lincoln Osiris.   Yeah!   Trying to hold his own onscreen   with Kirk   is action juggernaut Tugg Speedman.   Once the highest grossing star   in the world,   lately his  Scorcher  films   have lost their heat.   Recently, Speedman opened up to Tyra.   You have no real family.   You're on the wrong side of 40.   You're childless and alone.   Somebody close to you said,    One more flop and it's over.    Somebody said they were close to me?   It's been a tough year for Tugg.   The disappointing buddy comedy  Chitlin' &amp; the Dude  was followed by an ill advised venture   into serious dramatic territory.  Simple Jack,  the story of a mentally impaired   farmhand who can talk to animals,   was a box office disaster   that many critics called,    One of the worst movies of all time.    I ain't got a good brain.   I think you've got a fine brain, Jack.   You make me happy.   But now the question is,   can Speedman make audiences happy   in what's being called   the most expensive     war movie never made?
