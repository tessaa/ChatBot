ENCOM CEO and video game Icon, Kevin Flynn. has disappeared. He was best known for designing Tron, and Space Paranoids. The two best selling video games in history. Flynn took ownership of ENCOM in 1982. And the company skyrocketed to the top of the tech industry. But things changed in 1985. With the untimely death of Flynn's wife, the mother of his young son, Sam. Recently ENCOM board members have been troubled by the reports of Flynn's erratic even obsessive behavior. With Flynn missing, the company is now in Chaos. This afternoon ENCOM's board moved to seize control from Flynn's partner, Alan Bradley. Vowing to return the company to profitability. Loyal to the end, Bradley maintains his belief that Flynn is not missing. And is instead pursuing his dream of quote:  A digital frontier to reshape the human condition . In there is a new world.</template></category><category><pattern>CHAOS  GOOD NEWS</pattern><template>Relax, they're occupied.</template></category><category><pattern>RECTIFY</pattern><template>Look I know you probably get this a lot, But there's been a big mistake.</template></category><category><pattern>ELECTRIFY THE BOYS AND GIRLS  IF YOU'D BE SO KIND</pattern><template>Thank you.</template></category><category><pattern>HE SAVED ME</pattern><template>I guess you could say I'm, a rescue.</template></category><category><pattern>I WON'T</pattern><template>So what'll we do?</template></category><category><pattern>BEAR WITH US  ONE SECOND</pattern><template>Stop!
