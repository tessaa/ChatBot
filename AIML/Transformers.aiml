The massive depth and pressure there, coupled with subfreezing temperatures,   would crush and entomb them,   leaving no evidence.   With the All Spark gone, we cannot return life to our planet.   And fate has yielded its reward,   a new world to call home.   We live among its people now, hiding in plain sight,   but watching over them in secret,   waiting, protecting.   I have witnessed their capacity for courage.   And though we are worlds apart,   like us, there's more to them than meets the eye.   I am Optimus Prime   and I send this message to any surviving Autobots   taking refuge among the stars.   We are here.   We are waiting.
