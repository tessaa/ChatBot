This time in one of Amsterdam's most crowded tourist districts. The images of the bombing were captured on location surveillance cameras. The blast felt for miles. What was once a block long farmer market vibrant with color... ... is now in ruins and covered with ash. The exact number of casualties is not yet known... ... as emergency crews are still pulling victims from the rubble. But officials are saying it will certainly be in triple figures. KLPD antiterror unit investigators have arrived... ... and are examining bomb fragments in the hope of determining if this... ... and the other recent bombings on the continent and in the UK are connected. The consequence of a new bombing will no doubt have a devastating effect... ... on Europe's tourist business. Let's go now to Amsterdam's chief of police. We will do whatever we can to keep everyone safe... ... for you to live every day without being afraid. But we must be realistic. Terrorist threats are real, present, deadly and persistent.
