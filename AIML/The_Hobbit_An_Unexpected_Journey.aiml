No help came from the Elfs that day..   nor any day since.   Robbed of their homeland, the dwarves of Erebor wandered the wilderness.   A once mighty people, brought low.    The young dwarf Prince took work where he could find it. Labouring in the villages of men.   but always he remembered, the mountains smoked beneath the moon..   The trees, like torches blazing bright.   For, he had seen the dragon's fire in the sky, and city turned to ash.   But he never forgave and he never forgot.    That, my dear Frodo, Is where I come in.   For quiet by chance and the will of a wizard...     fate decided, I would become part of the tale.   It began..well it began as you might've expect.
