Nationwide for the killing   and violent abuse of animals,   offenders are fined   on average   only 32%   of the maximum fine possible   and have spent a mere 14%   of the maximum jail time.   Most offenders never   even come to trial.  It has been said that the greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be measured  by the way it treats   its animals.  Here in York County it might also be measured by the justice it seeks  for Avery Alan Ludlow   and his dog Red.   This is Carrie Donnel   reporting for KPZS...
