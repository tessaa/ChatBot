This is the face. It's no great mystery.   I'm an oilman, ladies and gentlemen,   I have numerous concerns spread across this state.   I have many wells flowing at many thousand barrels per day,   so I like to think of myself as an oilman.   As an oilman, I hope that you'll forgive   just good old fashioned plain speaking.   Now, this work that we do is very much a family enterprise.   I work side by side with my wonderful son, H. W.   I think one or two of you might have met him already.   And I encourage my men to bring their families, as well.   Of course, it makes for an ever so much more rewarding life for them.   Family means children, and children means education.   So, wherever we set up camp, education is a necessity,   and we're just so happy to take care of that.  So let's build a wonderful school in Little Boston.</template></category><category><pattern>YES</pattern><template>You are making such a misstep.</template></category><category><pattern>TIE IT DOWN</pattern><template>Tie it on.</template></category><category><pattern>THESE CHILDREN ARE THE FUTURE THAT WE STRIVE FOR  AND SO THEY SHOULD HAVE THE VERY BEST OF THINGS</pattern><template>Now, something else, and please don't be insulted if I speak about this.
