Each Quarter Quell is distinguished   by Games of a special significance.   And now on this,  the 75th anniversary of our defeat of the rebellion, we celebrate the 3rd Quarter Quell as a reminder that even the strongest  cannot overcome the power of The Capitol.   On this, the 3rd Quarter Quell Games,   the male and female Tributes   are to be reaped   from the existing pool of Victors in each district.  MRS.
