At around 10:00 pm, residents of Rochester, New York,   were awestruck when the calm sky was cracked open by a massive fire ball.   The meteorite's impact sent debris flying over   16,000 meters away from the crater epicenter.   The U.S. army has quarantined residents   within a ten mile radius of the meteorite.   A year has passed, however meteorologists are still baffled   by the extreme increase in weather within a ten mile radius of the crash site.   Eighteen months later, and only 13 out of the 75 residents   who were exposed to the massive radiation, have survived.   They have been nicknamed  The Rochester 13.    Scientists studying the  Rochester Thirteen    have confirmed that each member has developed   their own form of radioactive mutation.   The Bureau of Investigation is speculating that the charred body is the remains   of serial killer  Ringmaster Jesus    whose real name is Kevin Sherwood.   Kevin Sherwood, an evangelical preacher,   who authorities believe killed over 45 people in a four year period.   The Bureau has released the startling information tonight   that the serial killer Kevin Sherwood, was in fact one of  The Roschester 13.    A suicide note was found,   which experts have confirmed is authentic.   In the letter Sherwood referenced the meteorite as a sign to do God's work.   A search continues tonight for Ian Sparks   who authorities have identified as the  Matanza copy cat killer.
