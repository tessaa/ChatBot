1
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,799
Check, charge or cash?

2
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,989
Cash.

3
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,633
Make it out to...

4
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,592
Jack's Demolition. Tucson.

5
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,519
$788.30.

6
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,272
Taking me to breakfast?

7
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,198
I can't. I'm meeting Bosko.

8
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,794
Hey, Vincent.

9
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,399
Where are my barrettes?

10
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,597
I saw them on the kitchen table.

11
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,108
I already checked.

12
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,635
Coffee?

13
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,829
No school today?

14
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,997
My dad's taking me to the new building
and then to lunch.

15
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,713
Try under the sofa cushions.

16
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,396
He's already half an hour late.

17
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,992
He's going to show,
or stand her up like last time?

18
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,475
I'll make coffee.

19
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,829
Out of time.

20
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,514
Mom, my barrettes are not on the couch.

21
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,152
Wear the blue ones.

22
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,120
I don't want to wear the blue ones.
They don't match.

23
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,913
- Did you check in your bathroom?
- I checked everywhere!

24
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,359
What do you want me to do?

25
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,549
Find them!

26
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,473
- Mom, pay attention!
- All right, sweetie, all right!

27
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,318
Daddy's going to be here.

28
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,555
I won't be ready!

29
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,193
- I can't be late.
- You won't.

30
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,878
I will be late!

31
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,919
Before Daddy comes,
we can find them if we look together.

32
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,508
It's all right, baby. It's all right.

33
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,553
We'll find them together, you and me.
We'll find them.

34
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,355
Just relax. He won't come
before we find them. I promise you.

35
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,913
Give me another refill.

36
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,395
What's your name?

37
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,669
Waingro.

38
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,388
You're Michael?

39
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,036
You guys always work together?

40
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,073
All the time.

41
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,714
Real tight crew?

42
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,955
Real tight.

43
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,310
If this works good,
I'd consider going again, you know.

44
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,995
Yeah. Stop talking, okay, Slick?

45
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,434
How's he doing?

46
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,874
Hundred percent.

47
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,159
Right on schedule.

48
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,557
Made a right on Venice Boulevard.

49
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,078
<i>We're a mile and a half from you.</i>

50
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,235
Okay.

51
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,878
Just crossed over the No. 1 lane,
300 yards from you.

52
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,555
Get set.

53
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,709
I am.

54
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,029
Here we go.

55
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,955
211!

56
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,679
We're being held up!

57
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,637
<i>- 211 alarm. Armored car.
- There's the call.</i>

58
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,749
<i>Three minutes.</i>

59
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,275
Clear!

60
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,472
Eighty seconds left!

61
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,876
Get back! Get back!

62
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,789
Get back!

63
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,759
Slick, see that shit coming out of
their ears? They can't fucking hear you!

64
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,955
Cool it!

65
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,789
I got it.

66
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,389
Got it.

67
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,231
You had to fuck with me.

68
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,278
Want to fuck with me?

69
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,278
What are you doing? What did he do?

70
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,799
He was making a move.

71
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,274
Dumb motherfucker.

72
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,149
I heard them.

73
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,839
$1.6 million...

74
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,274
Forty cents on the dollar, $640,000 to you.

75
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,311
Here's $150,000 front money.

76
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,191
Get you the rest in two, three days.

77
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,793
Who owned these?

78
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,517
"Malibu Equity and Investments."

79
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,559
Roger Van Zant.

80
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,398
Owns banks in the Caymans...

81
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:47,229
runs investment portfolios
for offshore drug money. Stuff like that.

82
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,509
So?

83
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,517
You ripped off his bearer bonds.

84
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,755
He's insured.

85
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,633
That's the point. He collects
100% from the insurance.

86
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,274
He's a player. Maybe he buys
his bonds back from us...

87
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,279
for 60% of their value.
Makes 40% on top of the 100%.

88
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,152
Sell it back to him,
that's an extra $320,000 to you.

89
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,989
Try it on.

90
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,995
Kelso called.

91
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,155
About what?

92
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,073
A score he's putting out,
he wants you to look at.

93
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,476
I don't need his score. I got my own.

94
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,875
Says it's clean and low eight figures.

95
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,549
9:00 a.m. tomorrow.

96
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,908
What happened?

97
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,469
Don't ask.

98
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,429
Find the ambulance?

99
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,597
- Dumped it four blocks from here.
- 22nd Street.

100
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,398
They torched it.
Burned the guns, clothes, everything.

101
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,799
They were airborne. They taped the last
few seconds of the black-and-whites.

102
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,276
Stolen from Fresno two weeks ago.

103
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,278
Yellow pickup truck out of Whittier
a day before yesterday.

104
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,908
You taking this one?

105
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,237
Or does it stay in Division?

106
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,710
Does this look like gangbangers
working the local 7-11 to you?

107
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,637
Robbery-Homicide's taking it.

108
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,674
We got three motorists.

109
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,109
All they saw were men with masks.
They were distant.

110
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,674
TV man over there, however,
he was closer.

111
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,559
Did he ID anybody?

112
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,035
He was hiding. He heard it mostly.

113
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,833
What about them?

114
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,677
According to the TV man,
this guy started mouthing off.

115
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,869
Smart.

116
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,991
Somebody called a guard "Slick."

117
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,794
Now, I figure this guy...

118
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,832
went for that hold-out piece, ankle holster.

119
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,675
From here...

120
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,149
bang, bang...

121
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,679
bang, bang, bang.

122
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,069
This side.

123
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,751
This guy has got what appears to be
a double tap-entry wound to the sternum.

124
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,118
Tattooing around the head wound,
scorched bone, close range.

125
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,355
Probably executed.

126
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,874
It was $1.6 million in bearer bonds.

127
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,678
They ignored the loose cash.

128
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,473
'Cause they had no time.
They were on a clock.

129
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,274
Which means they knew
our response time to a 211...

130
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,153
had our air, immobilized it, entered...

131
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,796
escaped in under three minutes.

132
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,639
It's a good spot here.
We got good escape routes.

133
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,949
Two freeways...

134
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,559
within a quarter of a mile.

135
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,829
Traffic video camera?

136
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,191
Probably disabled. Check it anyway.

137
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,753
You recognize the M. O?

138
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,995
M. O...

139
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,559
is that they're good.

140
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,959
Once it escalated into a murder-one
beef for all, after they killed two guards...

141
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,354
they didn't hesitate.

142
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,234
Popped guard No. 3 because...
what difference does it make?

143
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,238
Why leave a living witness?

144
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,273
Drop of a hat,
these guys will rock-and-roll.

145
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,758
The shape charge.

146
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,630
The shape charge indicates
that they are technically proficient.

147
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,830
Proficient enough to go in on the prowl.

148
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:16,157
Let's look for recent high-line burglaries
that have mystified us.

149
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,757
Run "Slick" as an alias to the FBI.
You'll get the phone book.

150
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,599
Do it anyway.
Who's moving the bearer bonds?

151
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,350
Check the usual fences. You and I will
check Cuzomano and Torena.

152
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,755
I want you to take Goldstein and Alfaro.

153
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,279
Hang in with Forensics.

154
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,994
From the bomb squad,
I want the explosive.

155
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,873
If we're lucky, it's exotic.
We can trace the sale.

156
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,994
Get your hand out of that man's pocket.

157
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,233
Anyone want some pie?

158
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,999
Gotta go to the john.

159
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:34,235
I had to get it on. He was making a move.
I had to get it on.

160
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,272
Split's in the car.
I took out of ours evenly...

161
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,516
to make up for his full end...

162
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,119
'cause I want to pay off and get rid
of this motherfucker right now.

163
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,429
Hold it!

164
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,549
Where's the rest?

165
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,353
We're late. You look too good to go out.

166
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,517
I'll just jump you right here.

167
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,434
- Where is it?
- Squared the bookies, baby.

168
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,638
There's more in a couple of days,
so don't sweat it. We're late.

169
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,749
Come on.

170
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,472
You gotta be kidding me.

171
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,189
Honey...

172
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:37,836
it ain't worth the risks you take
for $8,000. Like in "Risk versus reward."

173
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,069
Let's go.

174
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,474
Get your coat.

175
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,358
There's no point talking.
You're just a child growing older.

176
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,794
What does that mean?

177
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,954
We're not making forward progress
like real grown-up adults living our lives...

178
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,150
because I married a gambling junkie.

179
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,398
Get in the fucking car.

180
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,712
What am I doing in here?

181
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,189
You're not!

182
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,880
Leave the bank book and the car keys...

183
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,513
in the kitchen on your way out!

184
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,315
- Are we going?
- Keep that crap. Dominick comes with me.

185
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,038
Don't even think about...

186
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,314
Tell me Albert Torena called back.

187
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,998
Albert Torena call Vincent?

188
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,309
No.

189
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,793
Report came in.

190
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,954
<i>The explosive was Dy-Ex,
used in demolition.</i>

191
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,077
<i>You can pick it up in Nevada...</i>

192
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,719
Arizona, New Mexico.

193
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,712
Too common to trace a sale.

194
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,593
That's wonderful.

195
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,955
You all right?

196
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,596
What happened? Where have you been?

197
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,189
Work.

198
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,112
Lauren's dad show up?

199
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,789
Didn't call...

200
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,593
didn't show. We waited for you till 10:30.

201
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:33,635
Now, does this guy have any idea
what's going on with this kid?

202
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,229
I don't know.

203
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,593
Fucking jerk.

204
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,429
Is she okay?

205
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,476
She's been in her room all day.

206
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,194
So, no, she's not okay. Neither am I.

207
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,199
I made dinner...

208
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,477
for us, four hours ago.

209
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:57,038
Every time I try to maintain
a consistent mood between us...

210
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,434
you withdraw.

211
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,830
I got three dead bodies on a sidewalk...

212
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,235
off Venice Boulevard, Justine.

213
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,754
I'm sorry...

214
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,838
if the goddamn...

215
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,748
chicken...

216
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,078
got overcooked.

217
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,549
Coffee, sir?

218
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,715
Please.

219
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,752
Will you pass the cream?

220
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,315
Thanks.

221
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,589
What'd you get?

222
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,755
What?

223
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,119
What are you reading?

224
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,993
Book about metals.

225
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,437
<i>Stress Fractures in Titanium.</i>

226
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,312
What kind of work do you do?

227
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,477
Lady, why are you so interested
in what I read or what I do?

228
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,392
I've seen you in the store.

229
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,714
What store?

230
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,031
Hennessey and Ingalls. I work there.

231
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,275
If you don't want to talk to me, it's okay.

232
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,072
I'm sorry I bothered you.

233
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,032
I didn't mean to be rude.
I didn't recognize you.

234
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,075
I work in metals. I'm a salesman.

235
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,674
My name's Neil.

236
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,915
I'm Eady.

237
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,193
You like working there?

238
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,915
Sure.

239
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,115
I get a discount and there's
a whole section of books in my area.

240
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,355
What area?

241
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,279
Graphic design.

242
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:46,072
I do letterheads and logotypes
at night and...

243
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,519
the store's a day job
until I get enough going.

244
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,233
Who do you do that for?

245
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,553
A restaurant.

246
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,957
I did their menus, and...

247
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,596
a small record label.

248
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,715
CDs.

249
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,912
I've done two so far.

250
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,792
You go to school for that?

251
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,309
Yeah.

252
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,634
I went to Parsons.

253
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,915
Where's that?

254
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,315
New York City.

255
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,633
How long you been here?

256
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,994
About a year.

257
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,029
Like it?

258
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,513
Not really. I'm mostly here for the work.

259
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,512
Live in this neighborhood?

260
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,279
No, I live kind of above Sunset Plaza.

261
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,473
It's a little house I rent.

262
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:48,036
And it's kind of rundown,
but a beautiful, beautiful view.

263
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,709
What about you?

264
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,034
I live up here.

265
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,559
That's very funny.

266
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,915
Where's your family from originally?

267
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,032
They're Scotch-Irish.

268
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,916
They emigrated to Appalachia...

269
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,996
in the late 1700s.

270
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,999
Where are you from?

271
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,948
The Bay area.

272
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,674
Your folks there?

273
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,995
My mother died a long time ago,
and my father...

274
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,599
I don't know where he is.

275
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,278
Got a brother somewhere.

276
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,797
You have a tight family. I can tell.

277
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,075
Right?

278
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,508
You're right.

279
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,518
City of lights.

280
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,279
In Fiji, they have...

281
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,915
iridescent algae that come out
once a year in the water.

282
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,196
That's what it looks like out there.

283
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,628
You been there?

284
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,791
No, I'm going there someday.

285
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,794
You travel a lot?

286
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,629
Yeah.

287
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,672
Traveling make you lonely?

288
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,477
I'm alone. I am not...

289
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,148
lonely.

290
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,509
You?

291
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,399
Real lonely.

292
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,435
Albert!

293
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,109
Shit!

294
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,520
What you doing here? You crazy?
This ain't Disneyland.

295
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,676
You were supposed to get back to me.

296
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,518
Where the fuck you been?

297
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,999
I couldn't break free.

298
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,031
Let's violate his ass right now.

299
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,673
I do for you...

300
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,190
you don't do for me, is that it?

301
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,112
Vincent, man. I swear, I was out all night.
I'm hitting like a Flamingo matador.

302
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,515
That's got nothing to do with me.

303
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:08,151
I'm cutting it smooth. I'm generating
leads and shit for you. I'm a dancer.

304
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,588
You bullshit.

305
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,109
I paged your ass all day.
I hate fucking paging.

306
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,674
You're a speed freak,
jacking methamphetamine again.

307
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,553
Where's your empathy?
It's a substance abuse problem.

308
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:21,150
Empathy was yesterday. Today you're
wasting my motherfucking time.

309
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,759
You fall in love?

310
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,793
Did you fall in love...

311
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,638
and went off somewhere?

312
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,876
Tell me that, I'll settle for it.

313
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,279
Give me all you got!

314
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,232
Give me all you got!

315
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:39,155
I swear, my brother Richard's going
to talk to you.

316
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,793
I heard Richard?

317
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,112
He's going to talk to you.

318
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,353
He's gonna meet you tonight.

319
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,913
He's not here, is he?

320
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,393
No, he'll meet you tonight.

321
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,953
What happened to now?

322
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:54,829
I implored him because I knew
you was coming this a.m.

323
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,949
Bullshit.

324
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,116
I swear. He said no...

325
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,271
'cause he in Phoenix.

326
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,590
<i>By the time I get to Phoenix</i>

327
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,872
<i>He'll be rising</i>

328
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,198
<i>He'll probably leave a note</i>

329
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,039
<i>Right on the door</i>

330
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,196
Tonight's the best I can do for you.

331
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:17,310
He'll meet you at BJ's on Alvarado.

332
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,469
At 2:00 a.m.

333
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,589
Be there.

334
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,233
You be there, too.

335
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,075
I can't be there, man. I got things to do.

336
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,919
I got things to do, I got places to be.

337
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,235
Be there.

338
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,190
Don't waste my motherfucking time!

339
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,349
What is it?

340
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,234
It's a bank.

341
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,996
It depos cash on Thursday for distribution
to all the other branches...

342
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,076
to cover Friday payroll checks.

343
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,237
So on Thursdays,
the command branch has got a full whack.

344
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,799
On the prowl or strong?

345
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,955
Strong. Through the door.

346
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,115
How many guys?

347
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:02,835
About four, or three, plus a driver.
You walk in, knock 'em over, walk out.

348
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,270
You want $100,000 in advance
against a ten-percent cut for that?

349
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,632
Sounds like a cowboy score.

350
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:12,230
They hit the hold-up alarms,
I gotta get out before the cops show.

351
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,235
They hit three hold-up alarm systems.

352
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,278
Two Telco and a cellular.

353
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,800
But the signals aren't
going anywhere because...

354
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,673
the night before...

355
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,148
you cut in...

356
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,828
and trick out the alarm system computer...

357
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,234
to turn itself...

358
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,351
and the video recorders off...

359
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,597
20 minutes before you enter.

360
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,997
Architectural, electrical plans?

361
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,189
I got that.

362
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,118
I got the boards already built.
They go right into the CPU.

363
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,879
What's the estimate?

364
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,196
$12.1, $12.2 million.

365
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,149
You're on.

366
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,429
Congratulations.

367
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:58,595
Let me give you a little idea
of where my estimates come from.

368
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,995
Nobody knew the merch was yours.

369
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:04,033
My way, you get 100%
from the insurance company...

370
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,991
take the bonds back from us...

371
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:09,476
<i>at 60 cents on the dollar
and make yourself another 40%.</i>

372
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,954
The operation doesn't skip a beat.
We all make out.

373
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,473
Sure, you got a deal.

374
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,437
Good, because there's no percentage
if everyone gets upset.

375
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,634
You have your man call me
and we'll set the meet.

376
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,035
Yeah, okay.

377
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,239
Nice talking to you.

378
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,838
You gonna deal with these guys?

379
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,679
Word's on the street
it's okay to steal my stuff.

380
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,109
I'm going to kill these sons of bitches.

381
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,312
Have Harry bring me the spreadsheets
for Canary Island's Offshore.

382
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,880
That's not really an estimate.
Those are exact figures.

383
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,072
I have a printout of the bank's cash flow
for the past two months.

384
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,758
How'd you get this information?

385
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,194
Just comes to you.

386
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,629
This stuff just flies through the air.

387
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:58,196
It's just beamed out all over the place.
You just have to grab it.

388
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,833
I know how to grab it.

389
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,078
Okay, here we go.

390
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,999
$13.9 million.

391
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,873
- I bought it.
- Good.

392
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,719
What did I tell you?

393
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,389
Here.

394
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,273
We're on. Call Van Zant,
collect the money.

395
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,549
How is he?

396
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,359
He's a businessman.

397
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,199
Chris is at my place.

398
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,595
What's wrong?

399
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,672
Husband-and-wife stuff.

400
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,912
I'll let him sleep it off.

401
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,119
What happened to you?

402
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,116
When will you get some furniture?

403
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,832
When I get around to it.

404
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,231
Charlene's gonna leave me.

405
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,549
Why?

406
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,551
Not enough steaks in the freezer.

407
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,516
With everything we've been doing?

408
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,114
Vegas and the Super Bowl cleaned me out.

409
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,877
When you gonna get an old lady?

410
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,598
When I get around to it.

411
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,911
You got something else on the side?

412
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,668
Nothing regular.

413
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,676
She got something else on the side?

414
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,028
- No.
- You sure?

415
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,559
Yeah, I'm sure.

416
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,557
I don't know what you're doing.

417
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,919
As Jimmy said, "You want to be
making moves on the street?

418
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,350
"Have no attachments.
Allow nothing to be in your life...

419
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,917
"that you can't walk out on in 30 seconds
if you spot the heat around the corner."

420
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,435
Remember that?

421
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,839
For me, the sun rises
and sets with her, man.

422
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,590
We take the delivery of cash
from Van Zant...

423
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:02,553
then I drop a deposit on Kelso
for this bank.

424
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,074
Bank? What bank?

425
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,199
What about the platinum thing?
It's ready to fall.

426
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,117
That goes, too. Then the bank.

427
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,439
Want some breakfast?

428
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,914
Are you okay?

429
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,674
Yeah, sugar.

430
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,995
For real.

431
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,189
I'll do good.

432
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,793
I'll see you later.

433
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,354
You Solenko?

434
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,795
I'm Don Breedan.

435
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,993
Grierson, my parole officer, told me
to come here, see if you had a job for me.

436
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,236
You're familiar with this kind of operation?

437
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,952
I'm a great grill man.

438
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,434
Good. Good for you.

439
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:07,439
You'll mop the toilets, hit the dishwasher,
bus tables and empty the garbage.

440
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,836
Give me a hard time, I'll report you loaded,
drunk or stealing.

441
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,712
I'll violate you back fast.

442
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,554
Twenty-five percent of your take-home
kicks back to me.

443
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,719
Rules of the game. Call Grierson,
check it out. Change in the back.

444
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,558
What are you waiting for?

445
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,158
<i>Malibu Equity and Investments.</i>

446
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,713
Roger Van Zant.

447
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,909
<i>Please hold.</i>

448
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,317
<i>This is Roger Van Zant.</i>

449
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,598
I'm supposed to collect something.

450
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,468
Someone will call you back
from another line.

451
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,679
818-133-6089.

452
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,993
<i>I got a package for you. There's a drive-in
on Centinela. 2:30 tomorrow.</i>

453
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,117
Just send one man, alone.

454
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,751
- Who was that guy?
- Nobody.

455
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,592
- Who was that guy?
- Nobody.

456
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,831
I gotta know who he is! Who is he?

457
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,069
He's nobody, Neil.

458
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,510
He's a legit liquor wholesaler
from Las Vegas. Alan Marciano.

459
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,353
Chris will make up.

460
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,994
- It's too late! I'm sick of it!
- Shut up!

461
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,837
Here's the deal.
You'll give Chris one last shot.

462
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:25,748
After that, he fucks up,
then I will finance setting you up myself...

463
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,036
on my own, anywhere you want.

464
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,792
Dominick will go with you.

465
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,195
And my word counts. But right now...

466
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,755
you will give him the chance.

467
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,358
Clean up. Go home.

468
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,238
Clean up. Go home!

469
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,668
Give me all your money.

470
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,711
You'll get smoked with that shit.

471
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:31,955
Won't be you.

472
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,996
He's coming in alone. Send him through.

473
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,078
Vincent, hey, man.

474
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,350
This is my brother, Richard. Vincent.

475
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,919
It's all right.

476
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,917
What have you got for me?

477
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:22,478
Before we even get into that, there's
this crew ripping rides all along the beach.

478
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,510
Now, in the back of a trim shop...

479
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:29,752
if somebody wants to pay
a little visit this weekend...

480
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,872
they might find two Turbos
and a 911 Slope.

481
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,360
You're looking to rid yourself
of your competition?

482
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,112
I'm a good citizen.

483
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,719
I'm Donald Duck.

484
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,792
You got something to tell me?

485
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,072
Check this out, cuz.

486
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,111
How do I know if I tell you
what you need to know...

487
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,677
that you're gonna do
what the fuck I need to get done.

488
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,032
Hanna is straight up.

489
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,990
I ain't your cuz, you rat motherfucker.

490
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,315
And you know because I say so...

491
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,593
after I hear what the fuck
you got to tell me!

492
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:05,755
Fuck you.

493
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,074
You understand?

494
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,237
I can get killed for telling you this.

495
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,476
You can get killed walking your doggie!

496
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:12,828
All right, man...

497
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,675
there was a cat I was locked up with.

498
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:19,992
Did a couple of two, three years.
He got out. I ran into him.

499
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,869
And so?

500
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,834
He's a big fiend for action.

501
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,430
Now, if he'd have said nothing,
I'd have thought nothing, but...

502
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,791
he goes on and on,
telling me how he ain't done nothing...

503
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,559
and nothing's been going on,
and all this bullshit.

504
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,557
Right then and there I know...

505
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:41,634
this cat's got something going down.

506
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,558
Pretty fucking great.

507
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,356
Albert, what's wrong with you?

508
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:58,390
You drag me here,
waste my time like this.

509
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:01,398
You saw a guy on the street
who's an ex-con?

510
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:02,509
That's right.

511
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,039
Well, I am...

512
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,832
over-fucking-whelmed.

513
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,629
What do you want for that,
a junior G-man badge?

514
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,270
You gonna make the call
on them Porsches?

515
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,434
Is he kidding me?

516
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:15,789
I'm telling you:

517
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,399
This Slick is no joke.

518
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,273
He's double time.

519
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,549
Say what?

520
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,111
"Slick." What does that mean?

521
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,589
That's what he calls people: "Slick."

522
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,718
Tell me about him.

523
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,632
About 6 feet tall...

524
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,797
lots of jailhouse tats.

525
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,956
Got a big-ass peacock right here.

526
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,799
What's his name?

527
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:42,908
Cheritto.

528
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,676
Michael Cheritto.

529
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,828
<i>Thirty-three busts since 1976.</i>

530
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:54,394
<i>Eleven for armed robbery,
three convictions.</i>

531
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:57,074
<i>Two out of a three-to-five year beef
in Attica.</i>

532
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,315
Three years in Marion.

533
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:01,557
Five years in Folsom off a knock-back
to involuntary manslaughter.

534
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:02,874
<i>Jacket's two inches thick.</i>

535
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,831
Who do I have there now?

536
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,554
<i>- Drucker and me. And Schwartz.
- Tell SIS...</i>

537
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,389
I want full surveillance. That's 24 hours.
Round the clock, day and night.

538
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,590
We never close. Open every day.

539
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,558
<i>Bug the car, the house, the work.</i>

540
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,796
<i>When he moves or sits,
like in a restaurant...</i>

541
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,275
<i>I want pictures of who he moves
and sits with.</i>

542
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,551
Then run makes on them.
They got jackets, trail them.

543
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:26,395
I want it up and running
by tomorrow night.

544
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,710
Put your hands where I can see them.

545
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:24,030
Put your hands where I can see them.

546
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,199
I tell you what to do.

547
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,958
I tell you how to do it.

548
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:32,036
Now, with your right hand only,
your right hand only...

549
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,949
take the package and throw it in here.

550
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,189
Behind you.

551
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,469
<i>On the right.</i>

552
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:12,913
Roger Van Zant.

553
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:14,589
Who's this?

554
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,479
You know who this is.

555
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:18,588
Yes, I do.

556
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:20,997
<i>I sent a guy to deliver the package.</i>

557
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:23,190
He didn't call. Is everything okay?

558
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,116
<i>I tell you what, forget the money.</i>

559
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:27,669
What?

560
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,958
Forget the money.

561
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:36,279
It's a lot of money. What are you doing?
What do you mean, "Forget the money"?

562
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,153
What am I doing?
I'm talking to an empty telephone.

563
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:41,393
I don't understand.

564
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:44,997
'Cause there is a dead man
on the other end of this line.

565
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:06,554
Do you like it?

566
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:07,999
Look at my ring.

567
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,349
Did you know?

568
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,273
You are insane.

569
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:23,389
Do you like it?

570
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,397
- It's beautiful.
- It's good.

571
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:27,391
Don't ask him where he got it.

572
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:38,070
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

573
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:39,555
I don't know.

574
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:43,839
Just like me.

575
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:45,393
I don't know either.

576
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,389
Hello?

577
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:02,229
It's me.

578
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,876
I was wondering if you'd call.

579
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:08,708
I've been busy.

580
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,268
Can I see you?

581
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,517
I was afraid that was just...

582
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,919
the one night.

583
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:17,792
Not for me, it wasn't.

584
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,639
Yeah, me neither.

585
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:25,159
Can I fall by?

586
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,515
Yeah.

587
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,557
I'll see you in a little bit.

588
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:45,672
Goddamn convention.

589
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,990
- Which one's Slick?
- The wide one.

590
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:50,912
We got two transmitters.

591
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,839
One's in the wheel well,
backup's in the firewall.

592
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:54,949
Here we are.

593
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,957
Did you say goodnight to Neil?

594
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,557
The blond is Chris Shiherlis.

595
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:03,036
SIS has got a revolving tail
and hung a wire on the house phone.

596
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:08,472
Cheritto's cruised the precious-metals
depository three times.

597
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,795
Platinum, silver, and some bullion.

598
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,228
Sammy and I think that will be
their next score.

599
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:15,634
Who's the loner?

600
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,119
First time we've seen him.

601
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:21,719
We're not on him yet.

602
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,028
Get on it.

603
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:46,631
When these guys walk out the door of
whatever score they're gonna take next...

604
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:51,512
they're gonna have the surprise
of a lifetime.

605
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,198
Baby, time to go.

606
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:12,035
Showed you a good time, didn't I?

607
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:16,509
You fly.

608
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:17,914
You're cool.

609
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:28,789
You're lying to me.
I can always tell when people lie to me.

610
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:30,908
I ain't lying.

611
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:33,039
You're a hot dog.

612
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,398
A regular rodeo rider.

613
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:38,958
And this was the monster fuck
of my young life.

614
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,959
Now, I got to get my ass
street-side, sugar.

615
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:48,196
You don't have a truth-telling style.

616
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,118
What are you talking about?

617
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,311
You don't know what this is.

618
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:00,955
The Grim Reaper's visiting with you.

619
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,234
Where have you been?

620
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:23,392
SHU at Pelican Bay.

621
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,398
Folsom, B-wing.

622
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:27,799
I am a cowboy...

623
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,397
looking for anything heavy.

624
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:32,511
Billy said to come see you.

625
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:34,992
That is why I am here.

626
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:46,200
Why don't you call this guy?

627
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:49,356
This guy's always putting guys on.

628
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:54,309
Thank you.

629
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,992
You're perfect for each other.

630
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,397
I knew a guy in grade school.

631
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,955
His name was Raoul... whatever.

632
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:23,470
You could take his fingers
and fold them over each other.

633
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,716
He'd turn his eyelids inside out...

634
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:28,673
I can't keep my hands off you.
That's the truth.

635
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,674
That's what's so wonderful
about you in that...

636
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,358
bestial sort of way.

637
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:39,915
Woman.

638
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,232
This better be earth-shattering.

639
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,279
This is to Raoul.

640
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:00,118
Yeah, Vincent Hanna.

641
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,438
Here's how we found her.

642
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,389
How old?

643
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:50,432
Sixteen, seventeen.
Been here about six hours.

644
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:52,593
How'd she die?

645
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:55,951
Beat her head in, same as the others.
Cerebral hematoma.

646
00:57:58,760 --> 00:57:59,829
Who's that?

647
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,594
Mother and siblings.

648
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:03,438
- Why are they here?
- It's fucked up.

649
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:06,313
Somebody inside knew the girl
and called the family.

650
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:08,509
Let's go.

651
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:14,109
Nice.

652
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:18,828
My intuition says the DNA check on
the semen will show it's the same guy...

653
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,872
so it's a series and ending up
in your court.

654
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:23,719
Sheriff's getting anywhere?

655
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:24,989
Not yet.

656
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:27,719
Get off of me!

657
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:31,709
Oh, my God!

658
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,035
Where is she?

659
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:38,839
Easy, easy, easy.

660
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,399
Please, come on.

661
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:47,952
It's okay.

662
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,599
Where is my baby?

663
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:51,869
Where is she?

664
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,790
I need to know what happened.

665
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:37,311
I guess the earth shattered.

666
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:40,759
So why didn't you let Bosko
take you home?

667
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,790
I didn't want to ruin their night, too.

668
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:46,468
What was it?

669
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:49,919
You don't want to know.

670
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:52,759
I'd like to know what's behind
that grim look on your face.

671
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,189
I don't do that. You know it. Let's go.

672
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:58,400
You never told me I'd be excluded.

673
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,477
I told you when we hooked up...

674
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,716
that you'd have to share me...

675
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:08,389
with all the bad people
and all the ugly events on this planet.

676
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,636
And I bought into that sharing...

677
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:12,473
because I love you.

678
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:16,469
I love you fat, bald, money,
no money, driving a bus.

679
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:17,755
I don't care.

680
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:21,514
But you have got to be present
like a normal guy.

681
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:24,518
That's sharing.
This is not sharing, this is leftovers.

682
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:27,558
What I should do is come home and say:

683
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:31,476
"Hi, honey, guess what?
I walked into this house today...

684
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:35,309
"where this junkie asshole
just fried his baby in a microwave...

685
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:38,750
"because he was crying too loud,
so let me share that with you.

686
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:41,553
"Come on, let's share that
and in sharing it...

687
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:46,510
"we'll somehow cathartically dispel
all that heinous shit."

688
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:47,829
Right?

689
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:51,235
Wrong.

690
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:52,429
You know why?

691
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:54,676
'Cause you prefer the normal routine.

692
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:56,916
We fuck and you don't speak.

693
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:59,076
'Cause I got to hold on to my angst.

694
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:01,039
I preserve it...

695
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:04,437
because I need it.
It keeps me sharp, on the edge.

696
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:06,148
Where I gotta be.

697
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:14,878
You don't live with me.

698
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:19,874
You live among the remains
of dead people.

699
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:25,790
You sift through the detritus.

700
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:28,832
You read the terrain.

701
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:32,395
You search for signs of passing...

702
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:34,991
for the scent of your prey...

703
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:36,997
and then you hunt them down.

704
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:41,160
That's the only thing you're committed to.

705
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:46,999
The rest is the mess you leave
as you pass through.

706
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:55,556
What I don't understand is
why I can't cut loose of you.

707
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:15,953
Let's go, baby.

708
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:20,238
I met the manager.

709
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:22,079
Is that the boss?

710
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:25,958
I did time for what that motherfucker
does every day.

711
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:29,636
Can you just handle it
till we find you something new?

712
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,193
Can you do that?

713
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:36,998
Ain't a hard time been invented
that I cannot handle.

714
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:44,672
Why're you hanging with me?

715
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:48,232
Because I'm proud of you.

716
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:55,313
You're proud of me?

717
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:02,111
Why the hell are you proud of me?

718
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:04,959
Come on home.

719
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:16,992
What were you doing there?

720
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:18,593
I was skiing.

721
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:20,512
I was trying to ski.

722
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:24,118
That's what people do there.
You go skiing...

723
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:26,638
and you meet people.

724
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,479
You try to have a good time.

725
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:30,158
- Did you have a good time?
- No.

726
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:31,349
Why not?

727
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:33,597
I'm not good at meeting people.

728
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:35,314
You met me.

729
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:38,435
That happened without my thinking
about it.

730
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:40,717
Which is why I probably...

731
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:43,316
No, it's because you are fine.

732
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:50,317
Take off with me for a while.

733
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:52,709
Where?

734
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,474
New Zealand.

735
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:56,795
When?

736
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:00,874
I have to go separate.
You can meet me there.

737
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:02,799
But my job...

738
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:04,956
I got money. You don't need money.

739
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:07,389
You could set up a studio and work there.

740
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:08,949
I don't know.

741
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:10,513
What's there to know?

742
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,079
Are you married?

743
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:14,709
What?

744
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:16,796
The last thing I am is married.

745
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,753
I'm a needle starting at zero
going the other way.

746
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,552
Then, all of a sudden...

747
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:24,391
someone like you comes along.

748
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:28,829
You don't know me.

749
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:30,359
I know enough.

750
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:35,519
Come with me.

751
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:46,393
What's wrong?

752
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:50,793
Nothing's wrong. Everything's right.
Will you go?

753
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:56,555
Yeah.

754
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:01,155
Good.

755
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:26,399
Hi, sweetie.

756
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:30,115
You forget your mom was picking you up?

757
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:32,829
No.

758
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:36,398
So, what's going on?

759
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:39,838
I felt like being alone.

760
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:44,477
Come on, I'll drive you home.

761
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:40,029
What's happening?

762
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:42,829
Sir.

763
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:45,474
Captain Jackson wants to know
what's going on.

764
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:47,949
Nothing's going on. Stay off the air.

765
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:41,634
Technique.

766
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,277
Open Sesame. Right there.

767
01:08:57,720 --> 01:08:59,039
There he is.

768
01:09:58,640 --> 01:09:59,675
We walk!

769
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:00,869
I'm there.

770
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,069
We walk! Now!

771
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:17,748
He's heard it.

772
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:27,034
Heads up.

773
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:30,671
- One's coming out.
- Hold it, Captain.

774
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,995
Vincent, he's not carrying anything.

775
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:34,195
I see.

776
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:39,430
- Here we go.
- Not till my boss says so.

777
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:41,790
Both of them are not carrying anything.

778
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:52,118
<i>- Let them go.
- What do you mean?</i>

779
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:53,229
<i>We can take them...</i>

780
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:54,395
On what?

781
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:56,398
They didn't steal anything yet.

782
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:01,157
It gets knocked back to a misdemeanor,
they do six months and they're out.

783
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:02,429
No fucking way.

784
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:05,632
I'm not taking the heat from my boss.
They are not walking.

785
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:09,150
That's exactly what they'll do.
They'll walk. This is my operation.

786
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:11,919
I have tactical command
that supersedes your rank.

787
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:15,032
They will walk away
and you will let them. Fuck!

788
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:00,433
Back to work.

789
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:05,790
LAPD, the G, what?
Where the fuck did this heat come from?

790
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:09,233
Maybe it's the score they were onto.
The place, not us.

791
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:11,715
Because it's been hit a couple of times.

792
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:15,833
Assume they got our phones, our houses,
that they got us right here, right now...

793
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:18,315
as we sit. Everything. Assume it all.

794
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,756
How will we buy the bank package?

795
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:22,313
I'll front that.

796
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:24,072
What about Van Zant?

797
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:28,154
With the heat we got, you want to play
World War II on the streets with Van Zant?

798
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:29,633
No, I want my 750.

799
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:34,279
I got more motivation to whack Van Zant
than either of you. He is a fucking luxury.

800
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:36,914
Our problem is to take the bank,
or split right now.

801
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:39,475
Do not go home, do not pack, nothing.

802
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:43,878
Thirty seconds flat from now, we are gone
on our separate ways. That's it.

803
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:50,637
The bank is worth the risk.

804
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:52,279
I need it, brother.

805
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:56,917
We should stay and take it down.
That's where I come out.

806
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:09,511
I roll with you, Neil. Whatever.

807
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:11,678
- Whatever.
- Not on this one.

808
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:13,677
On this one, you're on your own.

809
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:28,076
You figure this is the best thing to do?

810
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,311
This is the best thing to do?

811
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:34,433
I've got plans, I'm going away after,
so the reward is worth the stretch.

812
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:37,313
But Elaine takes good care of you.
You got plenty put away.

813
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:39,112
You got T-bonds, real estate.

814
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:41,913
If I were you, I would be smart
and cut loose of this.

815
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:01,274
For me...

816
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:03,356
the action is the juice.

817
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:05,075
I'm in.

818
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:11,828
Yeah, sure.

819
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:13,195
Let's go.

820
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,718
Fuck them, let's do it.

821
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:17,990
Let's go. We got a lot of work to do.

822
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:36,518
Tim, I gotta call you back.

823
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:39,070
- Can I help you?
- Are you Alan Marciano?

824
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:40,508
Who the fuck are you?

825
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:41,709
Who am I?

826
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:44,510
Lieutenant Vincent Hanna, LAPD.

827
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:47,916
LA? This is Las Vegas.
You don't even have jurisdiction here.

828
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:52,835
Do you know who you're pushing around?
I know people here.

829
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:55,758
Las Vegas PD takes you into custody.

830
01:14:57,200 --> 01:15:01,159
You are extradited to Newark
on a warrant for smuggling cigarettes...

831
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:03,271
up from North Carolina three years ago...

832
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:05,277
or you go to work for us.

833
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:07,159
Cut and dried.

834
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:08,874
That is it.

835
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:10,189
Shit.

836
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:12,752
Charlene Shiherlis.

837
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:13,909
Who?

838
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:15,069
Who?

839
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:17,198
What are you, a fucking owl?

840
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:21,069
The lady you been talking dirty to
on the telephone every day last week.

841
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:23,078
You can't tie me to her.

842
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:27,199
Who needs to? Your ass is on a plane
back to New Jersey, jackoff.

843
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:30,998
Why did I get mixed up with her?

844
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:34,078
Because she's got a great ass!

845
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:37,760
And you got your head all the way up it.

846
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:39,709
Jesus.

847
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:41,799
Ferocious, aren't I?

848
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:43,912
When I think of asses...

849
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:45,439
a woman's ass...

850
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,797
something comes out of me.

851
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:49,755
So?

852
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:51,433
So, no big thing.

853
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:53,599
All I want...

854
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:56,474
is her husband
and his whole fucking crew.

855
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:58,392
You'll work with Sgt. Drucker.

856
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:05,475
San Clemente Road and Hermosa...

857
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:08,598
that's where we cut through the fence.
That's the access.

858
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:09,709
Right.

859
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:12,309
The security systems around here
are a joke.

860
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,673
St. Vincent Thomas Bridge,
that's escape route No. 1.

861
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:21,555
No. 2:

862
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:23,750
<i>Over here. Anaheim to the 110.</i>

863
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:24,949
Good.

864
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:26,229
You got it?

865
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:27,679
Good. Let's go.

866
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:50,919
They were looking back...

867
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:53,793
in this direction.

868
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:56,238
A container facility?

869
01:16:56,360 --> 01:16:57,793
What? Cartage theft?

870
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:00,514
Too visible. Too lowball for them.

871
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:06,636
There's an oil refinery and a scrap yard.

872
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:08,034
Refinery only pays by check.

873
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:09,354
No cash around.

874
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:11,159
Same for the scrap yard.

875
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:15,788
Stealing hubcaps?

876
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:22,030
A refinery and a scrap yard.

877
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:24,992
What the hell is going on?

878
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:27,111
That's what we are trying to figure out.

879
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:29,352
We thought we had it.

880
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:31,348
Thought we had it.

881
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:42,159
I got an idea...

882
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:44,911
on what they were looking at.

883
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:50,596
Want to know what they're looking at?

884
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:55,113
I mean, is this guy something,
or is he something?

885
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:58,431
This crew is good.

886
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:02,158
Know what they're looking at?

887
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:04,069
What?

888
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:06,395
Us.

889
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:09,233
The LAPD.

890
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:11,552
The police department.

891
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:14,279
We just got made.

892
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:23,069
Yeah!

893
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:32,309
Okay!

894
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:43,477
Okay, motherfucker!

895
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:04,519
Kelso come through?

896
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:07,235
Yeah, you can build a bank with these.

897
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:14,393
Name is Hanna.

898
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:16,119
First name, Vincent.

899
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:18,597
I smeared this sergeant five yards.

900
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:20,153
Hanna's all over you.

901
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:23,554
He's on all the work cars.
Michael's house. Shiherlis's.

902
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:25,955
Not yours. They've been
losing you at night.

903
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:27,274
He's a hot dog.

904
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:29,710
Graduate school. Marine Corps.

905
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:32,038
Lieutenant in Robbery-Homicide.

906
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:35,550
He's taken down some heavy crews.
He blew away Frankie in Chicago.

907
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:37,238
He was a fucking maniac.

908
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:40,196
He was working Narcotics before that.

909
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:42,950
Divorced twice. Current wife's Justine.

910
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:44,638
He's why the extra heat.

911
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:48,918
The vice sergeant...

912
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:52,037
says Hanna likes you...

913
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:56,276
thinks you're some kind of star.
You do this sharp, that sharp.

914
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:58,755
Look how sharp this guy is to figure that.

915
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:02,519
Funny as a heart attack.

916
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:05,996
Three marriages? Do you think
that means he likes staying home?

917
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:09,029
Means he's one of those guys out there...

918
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:11,840
prowling around all night, dedicated.

919
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:16,429
With him and this much heat,
you should pass.

920
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:24,993
It's worth the stretch.

921
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:27,837
This guy can hit or miss.

922
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:29,878
You can't miss once.

923
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:31,749
You sure?

924
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:34,108
I am sure.

925
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,399
Let's go to the garage.

926
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:09,953
Where are we going?

927
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:16,479
Where are you going?

928
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:17,795
Out.

929
01:22:14,120 --> 01:22:15,075
What are they on?

930
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:16,349
<i>TAC 9.</i>

931
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:21,954
<i>They're northbound out LAX on the 405.
We got four ground units.</i>

932
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:42,514
<i>This is Vincent Hanna in Air 18.
Who have I got?</i>

933
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:45,036
<i>This is JJ. I'm in Air 40.</i>

934
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:48,197
<i>Richard Glover's with me.
It's on the 105 eastbound...</i>

935
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:50,072
<i>approaching the 110.</i>

936
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:52,639
Revolving tail?

937
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:55,394
<i>I got two units in front, three behind.</i>

938
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:58,592
Have one of them pick me up
at the Vermont on-ramp.

939
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:00,794
Let's go.

940
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:52,628
Am I 100 yards, or what?
Am I close or far, or what?

941
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,711
<i>Three hundred yards, center lane.</i>

942
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:00,388
How're you doing?

943
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:06,474
What do you say I buy you a cup of coffee?

944
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:13,988
Yeah, sure. Let's go.

945
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:15,869
Follow me.

946
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:32,798
Seven years in Folsom.

947
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:35,278
In the hole for three.

948
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:36,793
McNeil before that.

949
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:41,917
McNeil as tough as they say?

950
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:44,997
You looking to become a penologist?

951
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:47,758
You looking to go back?

952
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:52,033
I chased down some crews. Guys just
looking to fuck up, get busted back.

953
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:53,195
That you?

954
01:25:54,280 --> 01:25:56,475
You must've worked some dipshit crews.

955
01:25:57,200 --> 01:25:58,838
I worked all kinds.

956
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:06,114
You see me doing liquor store holdups
with a "Born to Lose" tattoo on my chest?

957
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:08,395
I do not.

958
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:09,589
Right.

959
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:12,798
I am never going back.

960
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:16,511
Then don't take down scores.

961
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:19,318
I do what I do best:

962
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:23,274
I take scores. You do what you do best:
Try to stop guys like me.

963
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:29,156
You never wanted a regular-type life?

964
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:32,480
What is that? Barbecues and ball games?

965
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:35,349
Yeah.

966
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:39,716
This regular-type life like your life?

967
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:42,237
My life? No, my life...

968
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:45,552
My life's a disaster zone.

969
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:49,749
I got a stepdaughter so fucked up...

970
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:53,232
because her real father
is this large-type asshole.

971
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:54,349
I got a wife.

972
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:57,199
We're passing each other
on the down slope of a marriage.

973
01:26:57,320 --> 01:26:58,309
My third.

974
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:03,989
Because I spend all my time
chasing guys like you around the block.

975
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:05,348
That's my life.

976
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:13,272
A guy told me one time:

977
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:19,238
"Don't get attached to anything
you can't walk out on in 30 seconds...

978
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:21,669
"if you feel the heat around the corner."

979
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:26,157
If you're on me and you got to move
when I move...

980
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:29,438
how do you expect to keep a marriage?

981
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:32,958
That's an interesting point.

982
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:35,674
Are you a monk?

983
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,109
I have a woman.

984
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:40,079
What do you tell her?

985
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:44,032
I tell her I'm a salesman.

986
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:53,478
So, if you spot me coming
around that corner...

987
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:56,277
you'll just walk out on her?

988
01:27:57,800 --> 01:27:59,313
Not say good-bye?

989
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:01,638
That's the discipline.

990
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:04,198
That's pretty vacant.

991
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:05,958
It is what it is.

992
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:08,719
It's that, or we both better go
do something else.

993
01:28:10,680 --> 01:28:12,557
I don't know how to do anything else.

994
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:14,393
Neither do I.

995
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:18,599
I don't want to either.

996
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:20,475
Neither do I.

997
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:30,348
You know, I have this recurring dream.

998
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:34,998
I'm sitting at this big banquet table and...

999
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:38,510
all the victims of all the murders
I ever worked are there...

1000
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:42,394
and they're staring at me
with these black eyeballs...

1001
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:46,794
because they got eight-ball hemorrhages
from the head wounds.

1002
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:51,032
And there they are,
these big balloon people...

1003
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:54,671
because I found them two weeks
after they'd been under the bed.

1004
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:57,795
The neighbors reported the smell...

1005
01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:00,273
and there they are...

1006
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:02,038
all just sitting there.

1007
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:05,315
What do they say?

1008
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:08,235
Nothing.

1009
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:09,795
No talk?

1010
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:13,592
They have nothing to say.

1011
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:16,357
We just look at each other.

1012
01:29:17,320 --> 01:29:18,878
They look at me...

1013
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:21,436
and that's it. That's the dream.

1014
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:25,952
I have one where I'm drowning.

1015
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:30,190
I gotta wake myself up and start breathing
or I'll die in my sleep.

1016
01:29:32,240 --> 01:29:33,514
Know what that's about?

1017
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:36,473
Having enough time.

1018
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:39,235
Enough time...

1019
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:41,318
to do what you want to do?

1020
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:42,714
That's right.

1021
01:29:45,160 --> 01:29:46,434
You doing it now?

1022
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:47,789
No, not yet.

1023
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:55,077
You know, we're sitting here...

1024
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:58,516
like a couple of regular fellas.

1025
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:01,359
You do what you do,
and I do what I gotta do.

1026
01:30:03,400 --> 01:30:05,630
Now that we've been face to face...

1027
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:11,034
if I'm there and I gotta put you away...

1028
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:12,799
I won't like it.

1029
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:14,709
But, I tell you...

1030
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:19,077
if it's between you...

1031
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:22,909
and some poor bastard whose wife
you're gonna turn into a widow...

1032
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:24,995
brother...

1033
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:27,232
you are going down.

1034
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:41,475
There's a flip side to that coin.

1035
01:30:43,720 --> 01:30:45,790
What if you do got me boxed in...

1036
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:47,912
and I gotta put you down?

1037
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:50,678
Because no matter what...

1038
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:53,037
you won't get in my way.

1039
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:56,436
We've been face to face, yeah.

1040
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:01,238
But I will not hesitate.

1041
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:02,834
Not for a second.

1042
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:10,519
Maybe that'll happen.

1043
01:31:13,160 --> 01:31:14,115
Or...

1044
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:15,708
who knows?

1045
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:18,550
Maybe we'll never see each other again.

1046
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:35,353
They dumped us.

1047
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:37,589
What?

1048
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:39,439
They dumped us.

1049
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:41,189
What do you mean?

1050
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:42,514
Chris slipped away.

1051
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:44,437
He doesn't talk about their scores...

1052
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:47,757
so there's nothing for me to get
from Marciano. I just tried.

1053
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:49,997
- What about Cheritto?
- Same.

1054
01:31:50,120 --> 01:31:52,634
Transponders got put on a bus
to San Clemente.

1055
01:31:55,240 --> 01:31:56,912
They dumped all our surveillance?

1056
01:31:57,040 --> 01:31:59,156
Yes, at the same time. 9:00 p.m.

1057
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:03,472
I had coffee with McCauley
half an hour ago!

1058
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:04,589
We were on you.

1059
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:08,429
Then McCauley drives in to LAX
where surveillance can't fly over.

1060
01:32:09,160 --> 01:32:11,435
His car's still there. He's gone.

1061
01:32:16,680 --> 01:32:20,992
Does anybody have any idea
where the fuck these people are?

1062
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:19,389
Hear from him?

1063
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:24,068
Not a thing. And not hearing
bothers me more. Where's this guy?

1064
01:33:26,520 --> 01:33:27,475
This guy...

1065
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:28,999
we put him on.

1066
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:30,678
Says he knows McCauley.

1067
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:37,155
Who are you?

1068
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:39,435
Waingro.

1069
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:41,558
My name's Waingro.

1070
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:44,957
I've been living in this office.
How well do you know him?

1071
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:48,675
We took some major scores together.

1072
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:54,277
Why haven't I heard from him?

1073
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:56,197
He's probably busy right now.

1074
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:58,358
But he's real thorough.

1075
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:01,716
He ain't going to forget about you.

1076
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:03,359
That's reassuring.

1077
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:07,475
I got some moves I could make here.

1078
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:10,676
Probably be a big help to you.

1079
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:32,918
You recognize the grill man?

1080
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:41,069
No.

1081
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:42,189
Folsom.

1082
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:44,550
D-block. Housed with Dobie Rush.

1083
01:34:46,160 --> 01:34:47,559
I ain't got my break yet.

1084
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:49,750
Cisco and Pancho didn't show.

1085
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,514
Haul out the garbage. Mop up the back.

1086
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:54,478
Take your break later.

1087
01:34:54,840 --> 01:34:56,193
Piece of shit.

1088
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:57,669
Pick up!

1089
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:02,233
Where the hell is he?

1090
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:04,476
I want to check the slot for the work car.

1091
01:35:04,680 --> 01:35:05,715
So did I.

1092
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:14,349
Hang on.

1093
01:35:17,240 --> 01:35:21,791
Use the land line. Call me at 103-7206.

1094
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:34,235
Where are you?

1095
01:35:34,360 --> 01:35:36,954
There's cops all over me, man,
like a cheap suit.

1096
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:39,194
I can't dump them.

1097
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:43,558
They know you see them?

1098
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:45,637
They're doing parallels.

1099
01:35:48,240 --> 01:35:49,719
I can try to dump them again.

1100
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:51,717
<i>How are we going to know if you did?</i>

1101
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:53,398
If not, you'll draw them to us.

1102
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:54,995
Go to Ventura.

1103
01:35:55,120 --> 01:35:56,314
<i>Pull them out of here.</i>

1104
01:35:56,440 --> 01:35:59,750
I'm sorry. Last thing I wanted to do
was let you down.

1105
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:26,269
Pick up.

1106
01:36:28,680 --> 01:36:30,113
Neil, man. What's up?

1107
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:31,309
What's up?

1108
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:33,078
What are you doing here?

1109
01:36:33,360 --> 01:36:36,670
I'm looking for a driver
who can handle scanners on the radio.

1110
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:38,028
Right now, today.

1111
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:39,628
You remember the drill?

1112
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:40,954
Yeah, sure.

1113
01:36:41,160 --> 01:36:42,229
You cool?

1114
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:44,518
You know I'm cool.

1115
01:36:45,280 --> 01:36:47,555
One answer: yes or no. Right now.

1116
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:03,873
Yeah, man. Fuck, yeah. You're on.

1117
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:06,679
Out back in five.

1118
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:18,039
What's burning?

1119
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:19,709
What is this?

1120
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:22,111
Where do you think you're going?

1121
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:56,436
Don't move! Put your hands in the air!

1122
01:38:56,600 --> 01:38:57,589
Hands up!

1123
01:38:57,760 --> 01:38:59,318
Put them up! Now!

1124
01:39:00,640 --> 01:39:01,675
Get on your knees!

1125
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:02,795
The keys!

1126
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:05,159
Get on your knees!

1127
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:10,429
Get over there!

1128
01:39:11,800 --> 01:39:12,835
Turn around!

1129
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:14,519
Put your hands behind you!

1130
01:39:14,640 --> 01:39:15,629
Get down!

1131
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:16,749
Stay down!

1132
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:18,715
Get down!

1133
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:23,709
- Down!
- The keys! The keys!

1134
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:29,389
Stay down!

1135
01:39:30,160 --> 01:39:33,038
We want to hurt no one.
We want the bank's money, not yours.

1136
01:39:33,160 --> 01:39:36,038
Your money is insured by the government.
You won't lose a dime.

1137
01:39:36,160 --> 01:39:37,275
Think of your families.

1138
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:39,755
Don't risk your life. Don't be a hero.

1139
01:39:40,120 --> 01:39:44,636
I want you to sit on the floor, put your
hands on your head. Anybody feels sick...

1140
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:47,194
anybody got heart trouble,
lean against the wall.

1141
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:49,515
The key.

1142
01:39:49,720 --> 01:39:50,914
What key?

1143
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:54,756
Sit down and stay down!

1144
01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:58,274
Sit there. Don't move. Let it bleed.

1145
01:40:45,560 --> 01:40:47,437
Get down. Down, down, down.

1146
01:40:47,680 --> 01:40:49,079
Put your heads down!

1147
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:15,830
You guys working a case
on a Neil McCauley?

1148
01:41:15,960 --> 01:41:19,032
This C.I., Hugh Benny,
called in about a bank.

1149
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:24,913
Far East National Bank, 11:30!

1150
01:41:41,680 --> 01:41:43,875
I want a block at Figueroa and Fifth...

1151
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,912
and I want a block
northbound Flower at Sixth.

1152
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:25,272
They're already coming out.

1153
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:27,796
We gotta take them in the car.

1154
01:42:27,960 --> 01:42:29,678
Wait till they are all in.

1155
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:32,115
Get clean shots. Watch your background.

1156
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:42,599
Police! Move!

1157
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,319
Move. Move. Get down.

1158
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:07,834
Move it. Down, down.

1159
01:43:11,200 --> 01:43:12,315
We did it!

1160
01:43:16,640 --> 01:43:17,629
Move!

1161
01:43:23,680 --> 01:43:24,829
Get down!

1162
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:34,989
Get in the car!

1163
01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:52,229
Go! Go!

1164
01:44:50,640 --> 01:44:51,629
Go!

1165
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:16,475
Go!

1166
01:46:53,440 --> 01:46:54,395
Come on!

1167
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:27,308
Get down!

1168
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:43,674
All the way down! Get down! Now!

1169
01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:42,588
Come here.

1170
01:49:26,280 --> 01:49:27,508
I got you.

1171
01:49:31,680 --> 01:49:35,878
<i>Tragedy in the neighborhood today.
A bank robbery spilled out into the street.</i>

1172
01:49:36,240 --> 01:49:39,118
<i>Claudia Newman, live on the scene.
She has the latest.</i>

1173
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:43,148
<i>This afternoon, a neighborhood was
terrorized by a bank holdup gone wrong.</i>

1174
01:49:43,360 --> 01:49:46,909
<i>With the streets full of shoppers and kids,
police and armed robbers...</i>

1175
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:48,393
Excuse me, bartender.

1176
01:49:48,600 --> 01:49:52,275
<i>Our top story tonight:
Robbery, pursuit and, finally, death.</i>

1177
01:49:52,400 --> 01:49:55,392
<i>A Los Angeles neighborhood is shaken
by a bank robbery...</i>

1178
01:49:55,600 --> 01:49:57,909
<i>that ended in homicide and terror.</i>

1179
01:49:58,200 --> 01:49:59,553
<i>Michael Cheritto...</i>

1180
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:03,559
<i>one of four men involved
in the foiled robbery, died at the scene.</i>

1181
01:50:03,680 --> 01:50:04,874
<i>Also fatally wounded:</i>

1182
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:08,151
<i>another suspect, Donald Breedan,
who died of gunshot wounds...</i>

1183
01:50:08,280 --> 01:50:11,716
<i>during the extensive gunfire
between police and suspects.</i>

1184
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:15,159
All right, hold him.

1185
01:50:15,480 --> 01:50:16,913
It's all right.

1186
01:50:24,640 --> 01:50:25,629
So?

1187
01:50:25,760 --> 01:50:27,671
He's got blood loss and shock.

1188
01:50:27,800 --> 01:50:31,395
I'll give you quarter-grain bottles
of morphine for the pain.

1189
01:50:32,240 --> 01:50:33,309
Bottom line?

1190
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:36,434
It's mostly tissue damage, which is good.

1191
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:39,155
His clavicle's fractured. Can you rest?

1192
01:50:39,840 --> 01:50:40,875
Six, seven hours.

1193
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:42,479
- That's it?
- That's it.

1194
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:44,279
Take off your shirt.

1195
01:50:44,400 --> 01:50:45,355
What?

1196
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:48,199
Take off your shirt.

1197
01:50:56,360 --> 01:50:57,679
My daughter gave it to me.

1198
01:50:57,800 --> 01:50:59,870
I don't give a shit. Take it off.

1199
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:12,875
Listen to me.

1200
01:51:13,280 --> 01:51:17,068
Nate's going to pick you up.
He's going to take you to his place.

1201
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:19,435
Where's Charlene?

1202
01:51:19,560 --> 01:51:23,758
We gotta go. We're on the 6:00 news.
We gotta get out of here.

1203
01:51:23,880 --> 01:51:25,791
I'm not going without her.

1204
01:51:26,160 --> 01:51:27,388
Think about that.

1205
01:51:27,720 --> 01:51:29,438
I will meet you at Nate's.

1206
01:51:29,680 --> 01:51:30,908
Where are you going?

1207
01:51:31,080 --> 01:51:34,675
To find out if our out got spilled
along with every other damn thing.

1208
01:51:35,160 --> 01:51:36,354
Who did it?

1209
01:51:37,680 --> 01:51:38,908
Who wasn't there?

1210
01:51:40,360 --> 01:51:41,315
Trejo.

1211
01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:46,519
See you at Nate's.

1212
01:51:54,520 --> 01:51:55,839
You still want me?

1213
01:51:56,240 --> 01:51:59,232
You come down here right now
and get me. Dominick and me.

1214
01:52:00,440 --> 01:52:01,509
<i>Okay, baby.</i>

1215
01:52:01,960 --> 01:52:03,837
<i>I'll be there in two hours.</i>

1216
01:52:05,120 --> 01:52:06,109
All right.

1217
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:09,798
Goddamn you, Chris.

1218
01:52:09,920 --> 01:52:10,989
Goddamn you.

1219
01:52:11,960 --> 01:52:14,076
You're on a plane to Los Angeles.

1220
01:52:14,320 --> 01:52:15,309
Right.

1221
01:53:01,680 --> 01:53:03,716
Why did you do it? What happened?

1222
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:06,519
- They made me.
- Who?

1223
01:53:06,680 --> 01:53:07,829
Where's Anna?

1224
01:53:09,200 --> 01:53:10,269
She's dead.

1225
01:53:13,120 --> 01:53:16,078
So is Michael and Breedan,
the guy who stood in for you.

1226
01:53:16,600 --> 01:53:17,669
Who did it?

1227
01:53:17,840 --> 01:53:18,795
Who did it?

1228
01:53:18,920 --> 01:53:20,558
They had Anna, man.

1229
01:53:20,720 --> 01:53:21,675
Who?

1230
01:53:23,040 --> 01:53:24,109
Waingro.

1231
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:26,029
Waingro.

1232
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:27,869
On his own?

1233
01:53:29,840 --> 01:53:31,478
- For someone.
- Who?

1234
01:53:32,720 --> 01:53:34,915
The other he worked for.

1235
01:53:36,080 --> 01:53:37,229
Van Zant.

1236
01:53:40,120 --> 01:53:41,348
Van Zant?

1237
01:53:45,480 --> 01:53:46,595
Are you sure?

1238
01:53:47,160 --> 01:53:48,354
Van Zant.

1239
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:52,310
Did you tell them how we're getting out?

1240
01:53:53,400 --> 01:53:54,799
I don't think so.

1241
01:53:55,480 --> 01:53:56,595
Come on.

1242
01:53:58,400 --> 01:53:59,879
I don't remember.

1243
01:54:05,080 --> 01:54:06,149
I'll call a medic.

1244
01:54:06,280 --> 01:54:08,032
I'm not going to make it.

1245
01:54:10,240 --> 01:54:12,231
I can't feel nothing.

1246
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:16,197
My Anna's gone.

1247
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:19,878
She's gone.

1248
01:54:21,840 --> 01:54:23,717
Don't leave me like this.

1249
01:54:24,720 --> 01:54:26,153
Please, homes.

1250
01:54:27,240 --> 01:54:29,117
Don't leave me like this.

1251
01:54:54,960 --> 01:54:57,315
You on a cellular? Use a hard line.

1252
01:54:58,200 --> 01:54:59,394
It's a new one.

1253
01:55:00,800 --> 01:55:03,155
The guy lives on Hillside Terrace, Encino.

1254
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:04,839
10725.

1255
01:55:05,200 --> 01:55:06,519
<i>10725.</i>

1256
01:55:06,840 --> 01:55:07,875
<i>Chris?</i>

1257
01:55:08,360 --> 01:55:09,998
He's with me, my place.

1258
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:12,550
Next, Waingro, okay?

1259
01:55:14,320 --> 01:55:15,548
You got the time?

1260
01:55:16,520 --> 01:55:17,839
I'll make time.

1261
01:55:18,200 --> 01:55:19,872
And I need a new out.

1262
01:55:20,560 --> 01:55:21,629
Is it blown?

1263
01:55:23,360 --> 01:55:24,918
How can I trust it?

1264
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:28,989
You got it.

1265
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:31,399
Stay healthy.

1266
01:55:36,720 --> 01:55:38,278
Charlene Shiherlis.

1267
01:55:39,160 --> 01:55:41,958
Drucker's got a safe house in Venice
to stash her in.

1268
01:55:42,080 --> 01:55:43,513
Neil's transportation.

1269
01:55:43,640 --> 01:55:47,315
Get on the phone. Somewhere, someone's
trying to put it together for him.

1270
01:55:47,760 --> 01:55:50,035
You don't believe he already had a plan?

1271
01:55:50,160 --> 01:55:51,673
Sure. Now he needs another.

1272
01:55:51,800 --> 01:55:53,836
Would you trust yours
after this afternoon?

1273
01:55:55,440 --> 01:55:57,795
This rat motherfucker,
where did we get him?

1274
01:55:57,920 --> 01:56:01,310
He's a C.I. for a burglary cop.
Called in the tip on the bank.

1275
01:56:01,520 --> 01:56:03,033
On Neil McCauley.

1276
01:56:03,240 --> 01:56:04,639
How much time we got?

1277
01:56:05,080 --> 01:56:09,517
Eight, ten hours for him to set up
a new out. After that, he's gone, bye-bye.

1278
01:57:01,040 --> 01:57:03,679
You ratted McCauley to us!
How'd you know?

1279
01:57:03,920 --> 01:57:05,148
Who told you?

1280
01:57:05,520 --> 01:57:07,715
Who told you, rat motherfucker?

1281
01:57:08,080 --> 01:57:09,069
Who?

1282
01:57:51,920 --> 01:57:53,319
Waingro, where is he?

1283
01:57:54,320 --> 01:57:55,389
Where?

1284
01:57:55,520 --> 01:57:56,748
How would I know?

1285
01:58:21,480 --> 01:58:22,435
Well...

1286
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:24,672
what do we have here?

1287
01:58:25,600 --> 01:58:26,715
This pretty?

1288
01:58:26,840 --> 01:58:27,875
This pretty?

1289
01:58:31,360 --> 01:58:32,759
You piece of shit.

1290
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:35,758
Told me you wanted out from under.
You're scared, right?

1291
01:58:35,880 --> 01:58:37,552
You want out? This is out.

1292
01:58:37,680 --> 01:58:40,752
- Yeah, what's your end?
- I don't need no stupid broad.

1293
01:58:41,320 --> 01:58:42,639
How'd I get into this?

1294
01:58:42,760 --> 01:58:43,749
Easy.

1295
01:58:44,520 --> 01:58:46,750
You heard me. She had a rough ride.

1296
01:58:47,120 --> 01:58:48,189
Fix her a drink.

1297
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:50,072
Look in the cabinet above the sink.

1298
01:58:50,200 --> 01:58:51,189
Fuck her.

1299
01:58:53,520 --> 01:58:56,034
You better get in there and stay in there.

1300
01:58:59,480 --> 01:59:00,799
Lookie here.

1301
01:59:02,280 --> 01:59:04,874
My name is Sgt. Drucker, LAPD Homicide.

1302
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:06,718
You want to put Dominick
in the bedroom?

1303
01:59:06,840 --> 01:59:08,512
He stays with me.

1304
01:59:18,240 --> 01:59:19,559
So, what now?

1305
01:59:22,280 --> 01:59:23,315
He's right.

1306
01:59:23,440 --> 01:59:25,351
You want out? This is out.

1307
01:59:27,160 --> 01:59:29,276
You believe you have to betray Chris?

1308
01:59:29,400 --> 01:59:30,549
No shit.

1309
01:59:31,120 --> 01:59:33,395
That's right. You would have to.

1310
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:37,675
See, if you don't betray Chris,
you victimize Dominick.

1311
01:59:38,640 --> 01:59:41,950
'Cause he'll be an orphan
when you go to prison as an accessory...

1312
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:46,596
'cause you got no parents to take him.
So he ends up raised in foster homes...

1313
01:59:46,720 --> 01:59:48,517
juvenile facilities.

1314
01:59:48,760 --> 01:59:50,432
Then he steals a car.

1315
01:59:51,120 --> 01:59:55,796
Then he winds up in gladiator academies
like Chino and Tracy.

1316
01:59:56,400 --> 01:59:58,550
Fucked for life.

1317
01:59:59,720 --> 02:00:02,280
You know what happens,
because you've been there.

1318
02:00:03,880 --> 02:00:07,998
Dominick didn't get a chance yet
to choose his life. But Chris did.

1319
02:00:09,920 --> 02:00:12,514
If you give up Chris, you get off clean.

1320
02:00:13,480 --> 02:00:14,754
You can do it...

1321
02:00:15,120 --> 02:00:17,270
for your kid, so you can raise him.

1322
02:00:21,160 --> 02:00:22,434
What else are you selling?

1323
02:00:22,560 --> 02:00:23,879
All kinds of shit.

1324
02:00:25,320 --> 02:00:29,916
But I don't have to sell this, you know it.
This kind of shit here sells itself.

1325
02:00:36,400 --> 02:00:37,879
<i>Here's an update.</i>

1326
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:39,479
Drucker's on Line 2.

1327
02:00:39,600 --> 02:00:41,033
<i>Hold on for a second.</i>

1328
02:00:43,800 --> 02:00:45,631
Drucker's on the other line.

1329
02:00:46,280 --> 02:00:47,429
Conference him in.

1330
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:49,629
Go ahead.

1331
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:51,558
Vincent, it's me.

1332
02:00:54,160 --> 02:00:56,196
One answer. What's it going to be?

1333
02:01:02,920 --> 02:01:05,309
We're set here. She'll make the call.

1334
02:01:05,440 --> 02:01:08,398
That's good. Here's the deal.

1335
02:01:08,800 --> 02:01:11,792
Hugh Benny has reformed
his wayward life...

1336
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:14,275
and become a born-again good citizen.

1337
02:01:14,600 --> 02:01:18,639
Apparently, Neil got sold out to us
by this cowboy named Waingro.

1338
02:01:19,040 --> 02:01:23,636
Waingro used to be a part of Neil's crew,
then went to work for a money launderer:

1339
02:01:23,760 --> 02:01:24,954
<i>Van Zant.</i>

1340
02:01:25,640 --> 02:01:28,518
Units are at Van Zant's house
as we speak...

1341
02:01:28,640 --> 02:01:30,676
because he got shot dead earlier tonight.

1342
02:01:31,240 --> 02:01:34,357
<i>If Neil goes after anybody else,
it's going to be Waingro.</i>

1343
02:01:34,600 --> 02:01:37,956
Waingro just got himself a suite
at the Airport Marquis...

1344
02:01:38,080 --> 02:01:39,877
under the name Jamieson.

1345
02:01:40,120 --> 02:01:44,477
He's there now. I want you to get that
to bail bondsmen, bookies...

1346
02:01:44,600 --> 02:01:47,433
<i>assignment officers
and snitches in County.</i>

1347
02:01:47,560 --> 02:01:51,712
Anyone you can think of who'll put it
on the street. Deploy a team at the hotel...

1348
02:01:51,840 --> 02:01:54,195
<i>and personally check their coms
every 30 minutes.</i>

1349
02:01:54,320 --> 02:01:56,595
Because maybe Neil will go for him.

1350
02:01:56,880 --> 02:01:58,108
How're you feeling?

1351
02:01:58,880 --> 02:02:00,359
Banged up, but I'll live.

1352
02:02:09,200 --> 02:02:10,474
He's here.

1353
02:02:11,200 --> 02:02:12,758
Neil is still here.

1354
02:02:13,920 --> 02:02:15,319
I can feel it.

1355
02:02:16,160 --> 02:02:17,513
For how long?

1356
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:20,831
Seven, eight hours, max.

1357
02:02:29,880 --> 02:02:31,108
What did you do?

1358
02:02:31,680 --> 02:02:32,669
That was you?

1359
02:02:33,040 --> 02:02:34,837
I don't sell metal.

1360
02:02:35,520 --> 02:02:38,432
Would have been okay, you fly out after.
Now it's jammed.

1361
02:02:38,560 --> 02:02:40,039
We gotta go together.

1362
02:02:40,520 --> 02:02:42,750
Those other people were with you?

1363
02:02:44,240 --> 02:02:45,753
My friend, Michael...

1364
02:02:47,440 --> 02:02:49,271
he knew the risks.

1365
02:02:53,640 --> 02:02:55,551
When it rains, you get wet.

1366
02:02:58,280 --> 02:02:59,759
Get packed. Let's go.

1367
02:03:18,440 --> 02:03:20,271
Why did you do this to me?

1368
02:03:31,400 --> 02:03:32,674
It'll be all right.

1369
02:03:32,800 --> 02:03:34,631
Do you understand?

1370
02:03:39,120 --> 02:03:40,792
It's going to be all right.

1371
02:03:51,800 --> 02:03:54,792
There's a Camaro at this address,
Level D, Slot 18.

1372
02:03:59,880 --> 02:04:01,279
Here's some cash.

1373
02:04:04,160 --> 02:04:05,354
When is it over?

1374
02:04:08,680 --> 02:04:10,272
Twenty-two hours from now.

1375
02:04:10,640 --> 02:04:14,428
- Then we get out of here clean.
- When will you let me leave?

1376
02:04:17,920 --> 02:04:18,875
Go now.

1377
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:20,877
You want out? There's the door.

1378
02:04:21,480 --> 02:04:23,357
Will you let me leave later?

1379
02:04:28,320 --> 02:04:29,799
It will be different.

1380
02:04:31,400 --> 02:04:33,038
Do you even understand?

1381
02:05:02,760 --> 02:05:04,034
It's ready.

1382
02:05:11,440 --> 02:05:13,158
This is my friend Ralph.

1383
02:05:13,800 --> 02:05:15,677
You didn't tell me you were...

1384
02:05:16,520 --> 02:05:17,794
Oh, my God!

1385
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:19,149
Where's Lauren?

1386
02:05:19,520 --> 02:05:21,192
She's at Lisa-Beth's.

1387
02:05:21,680 --> 02:05:23,716
This has nothing to do with me. I'm sorry.

1388
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:24,875
What for?

1389
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:26,069
Sit down.

1390
02:05:27,040 --> 02:05:28,359
Don't you get angry?

1391
02:05:29,200 --> 02:05:30,235
I'm angry.

1392
02:05:31,920 --> 02:05:33,672
I'm very angry, Ralph.

1393
02:05:34,400 --> 02:05:37,198
You can ball my wife if she wants you to.

1394
02:05:38,720 --> 02:05:41,951
You can lounge around here on her sofa.

1395
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:44,792
In her ex-husband's...

1396
02:05:45,320 --> 02:05:48,392
dead-tech, post-modernistic,
bullshit house...

1397
02:05:48,520 --> 02:05:49,839
if you want to.

1398
02:05:52,440 --> 02:05:54,556
But you do not get to watch...

1399
02:05:54,880 --> 02:05:56,632
my fucking...

1400
02:05:56,760 --> 02:05:57,875
television set!

1401
02:05:58,000 --> 02:05:59,274
For God's sake.

1402
02:06:05,880 --> 02:06:07,598
Put the television set down.

1403
02:06:07,760 --> 02:06:10,194
- I never cheated on you, bitch.
- Maybe you should have.

1404
02:06:10,320 --> 02:06:12,311
- I should have?
- You're a party to this.

1405
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:15,517
I made Ralph fuck you
because it makes me feel good.

1406
02:06:15,640 --> 02:06:17,198
Our situation is absurd.

1407
02:06:19,720 --> 02:06:22,393
Shut up, Ralph! Sit down!

1408
02:06:25,200 --> 02:06:28,875
Why is it that I have to figure things out
and explain them to you?

1409
02:06:29,080 --> 02:06:31,548
I say what I mean, and I do what I say.

1410
02:06:31,680 --> 02:06:32,829
How admirable.

1411
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:35,110
- You bet.
- Except none of it's about us.

1412
02:06:35,760 --> 02:06:36,715
No.

1413
02:06:38,120 --> 02:06:40,953
I may be stoned on grass and Prozac but...

1414
02:06:41,760 --> 02:06:43,751
you walk through our life dead.

1415
02:06:44,480 --> 02:06:48,359
Now I have to demean myself with Ralph
just to get closure with you.

1416
02:07:00,880 --> 02:07:03,155
Passports, traveler's checks, plastic.

1417
02:07:03,680 --> 02:07:04,829
The plane...

1418
02:07:05,280 --> 02:07:08,590
charter terminal, LAX, Hangar 17.

1419
02:07:08,720 --> 02:07:10,278
Call letters are 1011 Sierra.

1420
02:07:13,400 --> 02:07:14,515
Touches down...

1421
02:07:14,640 --> 02:07:17,029
holds for you five minutes, then splits.

1422
02:07:17,280 --> 02:07:20,670
The plane will stand an FAA check.
Filed a flight plan, the works.

1423
02:07:22,480 --> 02:07:23,515
Where's Chris?

1424
02:07:23,840 --> 02:07:24,829
He's gone.

1425
02:07:26,160 --> 02:07:27,115
What?

1426
02:07:27,760 --> 02:07:30,149
Said he's going on his own.
Went to find Charlene.

1427
02:07:30,280 --> 02:07:32,430
- Did you bring him here?
- Yeah, I did.

1428
02:07:33,280 --> 02:07:34,269
What happened?

1429
02:07:35,360 --> 02:07:36,839
It's a free country.

1430
02:07:41,880 --> 02:07:43,598
Check in with me at 9:00...

1431
02:07:43,880 --> 02:07:45,552
everything is still cool.

1432
02:07:47,360 --> 02:07:48,429
All right.

1433
02:08:10,680 --> 02:08:13,035
I don't know what I'm doing anymore.

1434
02:08:16,240 --> 02:08:17,958
I know life is short.

1435
02:08:18,600 --> 02:08:20,556
Whatever time you get is luck.

1436
02:08:23,200 --> 02:08:24,679
You want to walk?

1437
02:08:27,440 --> 02:08:29,112
You walk right now...

1438
02:08:30,680 --> 02:08:32,193
all on your own.

1439
02:08:32,880 --> 02:08:35,394
On your own you choose to come with me.

1440
02:08:41,560 --> 02:08:43,073
All I know is...

1441
02:08:45,280 --> 02:08:48,750
there's no point in me
going anywhere anymore...

1442
02:08:49,920 --> 02:08:51,797
if it's going to be alone...

1443
02:08:52,840 --> 02:08:54,273
without you.

1444
02:09:51,880 --> 02:09:52,915
I got a live one.

1445
02:09:53,840 --> 02:09:55,159
I'll hold.

1446
02:09:57,520 --> 02:09:58,919
Show yourself.

1447
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:01,956
- Do it.
- Shut up!

1448
02:10:05,680 --> 02:10:07,796
Now, just one second at the window...

1449
02:10:09,040 --> 02:10:10,712
and it's all over.

1450
02:11:56,240 --> 02:11:57,229
Hey, man...

1451
02:11:58,960 --> 02:12:02,077
you know any place to rent around here?

1452
02:12:05,320 --> 02:12:07,356
The grocer has got cards on the wall.

1453
02:12:19,040 --> 02:12:20,109
It's not him.

1454
02:12:20,240 --> 02:12:21,514
It's not Chris.

1455
02:12:29,360 --> 02:12:30,952
Unit 2, this is Command.

1456
02:12:31,440 --> 02:12:32,759
Take him at the street.

1457
02:12:32,880 --> 02:12:33,995
Check him out.

1458
02:13:00,520 --> 02:13:01,873
He's John Peterson.

1459
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:03,877
<i>Valid ID. Car's registered to...</i>

1460
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,309
<i>Bukowski, Gene.</i>

1461
02:13:06,640 --> 02:13:07,789
<i>Ran it to DMV.</i>

1462
02:13:07,920 --> 02:13:09,114
<i>It's clean.</i>

1463
02:13:11,920 --> 02:13:13,069
Let him go.

1464
02:13:13,520 --> 02:13:14,555
Roger.

1465
02:13:14,840 --> 02:13:16,717
Thank you. Have a good evening.

1466
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:20,035
It's no-go.

1467
02:13:29,440 --> 02:13:32,113
Would you like a cup of coffee
while we wait?

1468
02:13:32,240 --> 02:13:33,878
Yeah, that would be nice.

1469
02:14:03,760 --> 02:14:05,034
What do you got?

1470
02:14:05,160 --> 02:14:06,513
<i>Nothing's happening.</i>

1471
02:14:19,240 --> 02:14:20,639
Hello, it's Vincent.

1472
02:14:21,240 --> 02:14:22,229
<i>What do you got?</i>

1473
02:14:22,360 --> 02:14:24,669
Nothing's going on. Waingro went for ice.

1474
02:14:25,040 --> 02:14:26,075
<i>That's it.</i>

1475
02:14:34,520 --> 02:14:35,748
You know what?

1476
02:14:38,240 --> 02:14:39,593
Neil is gone.

1477
02:14:44,520 --> 02:14:45,999
Flying like a bird.

1478
02:14:46,880 --> 02:14:48,108
How do you know?

1479
02:14:49,640 --> 02:14:50,789
We still got bait!

1480
02:14:50,920 --> 02:14:52,876
- Maybe some time!
- What do we got?

1481
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:54,228
What do we got?

1482
02:14:55,120 --> 02:14:56,997
<i>Bon voyage, motherfucker.</i>

1483
02:14:58,440 --> 02:14:59,839
You were good.

1484
02:15:01,600 --> 02:15:03,158
I'm going to the hotel.

1485
02:15:04,400 --> 02:15:06,277
I'm going to take a shower...

1486
02:15:07,280 --> 02:15:09,999
and I'm going to sleep for a month.

1487
02:17:15,520 --> 02:17:16,509
Here.

1488
02:17:23,360 --> 02:17:24,349
Come on.

1489
02:17:32,680 --> 02:17:33,669
Shit.

1490
02:17:42,600 --> 02:17:44,238
Motherfucking waste.

1491
02:17:47,600 --> 02:17:50,433
Assholes shoot themselves all fucking day.

1492
02:17:50,560 --> 02:17:51,549
Not you, baby.

1493
02:17:51,680 --> 02:17:52,829
Not you.

1494
02:17:57,960 --> 02:18:00,793
Where would she be? Her name is Lauren.

1495
02:18:00,920 --> 02:18:03,593
Lauren Gustafson,
and she's supposed to be here.

1496
02:18:10,680 --> 02:18:12,671
I need somebody to help...

1497
02:18:18,600 --> 02:18:19,635
I got you.

1498
02:18:20,920 --> 02:18:23,878
You'll be all right, I swear. It's okay, baby.

1499
02:18:24,400 --> 02:18:25,833
Let's get a doctor!

1500
02:18:25,960 --> 02:18:27,598
Let's go! A doctor here!

1501
02:18:27,920 --> 02:18:30,195
- There's your mama.
- Let's just calm down.

1502
02:18:30,320 --> 02:18:32,356
- Is she on any drugs?
- I'm calm. No.

1503
02:18:34,800 --> 02:18:37,155
Get a trauma surgeon
and a vascular surgeon.

1504
02:18:37,560 --> 02:18:40,870
I think she cut both arteries.
I could hardly feel her pulse.

1505
02:18:41,240 --> 02:18:42,355
Her pressure's down.

1506
02:18:42,480 --> 02:18:44,596
So is her respiration.
You have to intubate her.

1507
02:18:44,720 --> 02:18:45,869
It's ready.

1508
02:18:47,480 --> 02:18:49,391
When's the last time anybody saw her?

1509
02:18:49,520 --> 02:18:50,475
I don't know.

1510
02:18:50,600 --> 02:18:51,874
Where did you find her?

1511
02:18:52,080 --> 02:18:53,149
The bathtub.

1512
02:18:55,080 --> 02:18:57,230
Give her large-bore normal saline.

1513
02:18:57,360 --> 02:18:58,713
Keep pressure on those bleeders.

1514
02:18:58,840 --> 02:19:02,037
Give me two units, O-negative.
Let's type and cross her for six.

1515
02:19:03,920 --> 02:19:07,230
Where is Respiratory? We need more help.
Get them down now.

1516
02:19:07,360 --> 02:19:10,193
Let's have X-ray ready
for post-intubation chest X-ray.

1517
02:19:16,280 --> 02:19:19,238
Your daughter's out of surgery
and she's in the recovery room.

1518
02:19:19,360 --> 02:19:20,759
Her vital signs are stable.

1519
02:19:20,920 --> 02:19:23,309
The surgeon will speak to you
in a few moments.

1520
02:19:23,440 --> 02:19:24,475
She's okay?

1521
02:19:24,600 --> 02:19:25,635
She's doing good.

1522
02:19:25,760 --> 02:19:27,193
She'll be okay.

1523
02:19:27,680 --> 02:19:29,477
She's going to be okay.

1524
02:19:29,680 --> 02:19:32,433
Oh, my baby.
Why did she do this to herself?

1525
02:19:33,840 --> 02:19:36,798
Look what she did.
Look what she did to herself.

1526
02:19:41,040 --> 02:19:43,554
It's all right. It's going to be all right.

1527
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:45,991
I'm here. I ain't going anywhere.

1528
02:19:46,120 --> 02:19:48,759
Do you understand?
I ain't going anywhere.

1529
02:20:03,120 --> 02:20:04,155
It's me.

1530
02:20:04,600 --> 02:20:07,239
Plane's in the air now.
You're right on time.

1531
02:20:07,880 --> 02:20:09,677
I still can't find a driver...

1532
02:20:09,840 --> 02:20:11,432
<i>so that's in the trust.</i>

1533
02:20:11,840 --> 02:20:13,159
<i>One other thing...</i>

1534
02:20:14,160 --> 02:20:15,957
<i>I gotta tell you.</i>

1535
02:20:16,400 --> 02:20:20,313
The guy you want is in the Marquis
under Jamieson, if you still give a shit...

1536
02:20:20,600 --> 02:20:22,272
<i>which I figured you wouldn't.</i>

1537
02:20:22,560 --> 02:20:23,879
You figured right.

1538
02:20:24,320 --> 02:20:25,799
So, so long, brother.

1539
02:20:27,960 --> 02:20:29,359
You take it easy.

1540
02:20:30,040 --> 02:20:31,268
You're home free.

1541
02:20:33,280 --> 02:20:34,429
Take it easy.

1542
02:20:45,040 --> 02:20:46,075
What is it?

1543
02:20:46,400 --> 02:20:47,515
Nothing.

1544
02:20:47,840 --> 02:20:48,989
Home free.

1545
02:21:25,640 --> 02:21:27,437
I gotta take care of something.

1546
02:21:27,600 --> 02:21:28,794
Is there time?

1547
02:21:29,480 --> 02:21:30,595
There's time.

1548
02:21:58,200 --> 02:22:00,714
I'll be right back. Just leave her running.

1549
02:22:41,360 --> 02:22:42,315
<i>Registration.</i>

1550
02:22:42,440 --> 02:22:43,475
This is room service.

1551
02:22:43,600 --> 02:22:47,309
A Jamieson ordered a BLT, and they
screwed up his room number. What is it?

1552
02:22:47,440 --> 02:22:49,158
<i>- They're always doing that.
- I know.</i>

1553
02:22:49,280 --> 02:22:50,759
<i>1735.</i>

1554
02:22:50,880 --> 02:22:52,029
Thank you.

1555
02:24:31,520 --> 02:24:33,112
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

1556
02:24:33,240 --> 02:24:36,152
<i>We are currently experiencing a fire alarm.</i>

1557
02:24:36,720 --> 02:24:38,073
<i>Do not panic.</i>

1558
02:24:38,200 --> 02:24:40,111
<i>Do not take the elevators.</i>

1559
02:24:44,960 --> 02:24:46,313
I'm staying here.

1560
02:24:46,440 --> 02:24:49,591
I'll check the stairs.
If there's smoke, I'll pull you out.

1561
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,195
What about her dad? Should I call him?

1562
02:24:57,240 --> 02:24:59,356
He's somewhere in the Sierras.

1563
02:25:01,360 --> 02:25:02,918
And she chose you.

1564
02:25:05,440 --> 02:25:07,158
She picked your place.

1565
02:25:09,280 --> 02:25:11,077
It's not right, what happened to her.

1566
02:25:11,200 --> 02:25:12,599
No, it's not.

1567
02:25:28,400 --> 02:25:30,038
Is there any way that...

1568
02:25:32,320 --> 02:25:34,276
it could work out between us?

1569
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:39,230
I wish I could say yes, you know.

1570
02:25:39,600 --> 02:25:40,589
But...

1571
02:25:40,800 --> 02:25:42,279
in the end...

1572
02:25:47,040 --> 02:25:48,678
It's like you said:

1573
02:25:51,720 --> 02:25:52,994
All I am...

1574
02:25:53,680 --> 02:25:55,671
is what I'm going after.

1575
02:26:02,800 --> 02:26:04,870
I'm not what you want, Justine.

1576
02:26:15,560 --> 02:26:17,391
Go on, if you have to.

1577
02:26:20,080 --> 02:26:21,149
I'll stay.

1578
02:26:21,280 --> 02:26:23,236
I'm okay. I can handle this.

1579
02:26:26,160 --> 02:26:27,559
Just be careful.

1580
02:26:28,320 --> 02:26:30,834
Call me here. Let me know you're okay.

1581
02:26:31,920 --> 02:26:32,875
Okay?

1582
02:27:31,200 --> 02:27:33,430
Security. There's a fire on three.

1583
02:27:33,560 --> 02:27:35,118
We have to evacuate all floors.

1584
02:27:35,240 --> 02:27:36,798
I can't leave here.

1585
02:27:45,320 --> 02:27:48,198
Why don't we just talk
about this a bit, brother?

1586
02:28:01,920 --> 02:28:03,148
He's here on 17.

1587
02:28:06,040 --> 02:28:07,189
Look at me.

1588
02:28:07,360 --> 02:28:08,349
Look at me!

1589
02:28:11,600 --> 02:28:12,589
Look at me!

1590
02:28:43,280 --> 02:28:44,599
LAPD! Don't move!

1591
02:28:44,720 --> 02:28:46,438
Put your hands on your head!

1592
02:29:20,560 --> 02:29:22,312
Switch me to TAC 5.

1593
02:29:22,920 --> 02:29:24,069
Casals...

1594
02:29:24,400 --> 02:29:25,389
JJ...

1595
02:29:26,120 --> 02:29:27,348
Drucker, JJ...

1596
02:29:27,480 --> 02:29:29,710
<i>I'm in the lobby level by the stairwell.</i>

1597
02:29:29,840 --> 02:29:30,875
What have you got?

1598
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,673
<i>Teams are moving up the other elevators
to the 17th floor.</i>

1599
02:29:33,800 --> 02:29:37,076
<i>Elevators are all out of commission
because of the fire alarm.</i>

1600
02:29:37,520 --> 02:29:38,794
Fine. 10-4.

1601
02:31:57,880 --> 02:31:59,359
Let me have that shotgun.

1602
02:38:02,040 --> 02:38:04,076
Told you I'm never going back.

1603
02:38:08,080 --> 02:38:09,069
Yeah.

1604
02:43:40,080 --> 02:43:41,035
English
