1
00:00:30,784 --> 00:00:32,884
<i>Although each of the world's countries</i>

2
00:00:32,884 --> 00:00:34,084
<i>would like to dispute this fact,</i>

3
00:00:34,184 --> 00:00:35,584
<i>we French know the truth:</i>

4
00:00:35,684 --> 00:00:37,984
<i>The best food in the world
is made in France.</i>

5
00:00:38,084 --> 00:00:40,084
<i>The best food in France
is made in Paris.</i>

6
00:00:40,284 --> 00:00:44,684
<i>And the best food in Paris, some say,
is made by Chef Auguste Gusteau.</i>

7
00:00:44,884 --> 00:00:47,184
<i>Gusteau's restaurant
is the toast of Paris,</i>

8
00:00:47,284 --> 00:00:48,984
<i>booked five months in advance.</i>

9
00:00:49,084 --> 00:00:51,784
<i>And his dazzling ascent
to the top of fine French cuisine</i>

10
00:00:51,884 --> 00:00:54,184
<i>has made his competitors envious.</i>

11
00:00:54,284 --> 00:00:57,584
<i>He is the youngest chef ever
to achieve a five-star rating.</i>

12
00:00:57,784 --> 00:00:59,884
<i>Chef Gusteau's cookbook,
Anyone Can Cook!</i>

13
00:00:59,984 --> 00:01:02,084
<i>climbed to the top of the bestseller list.</i>

14
00:01:02,184 --> 00:01:04,484
<i>But not everyone
celebrates its success.</i>

15
00:01:04,584 --> 00:01:07,484
<i>Amusing title, Anyone Can Cook!</i>

16
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:11,284
<i>What's even more amusing is that
Gusteau actually seems to believe it.</i>

17
00:01:11,484 --> 00:01:13,884
<i>I, on the other hand,
take cooking seriously.</i>

18
00:01:14,084 --> 00:01:17,784
<i>And, no, I don't think anyone can do it.</i>

19
00:01:56,084 --> 00:01:58,084
<i>This is me.</i>

20
00:01:58,484 --> 00:02:01,884
<i>I think it's apparent
I need to rethink my life a little bit.</i>

21
00:02:01,984 --> 00:02:03,584
<i>What's my problem?</i>

22
00:02:03,684 --> 00:02:05,584
<i>First of all, I'm a rat.</i>

23
00:02:07,684 --> 00:02:10,184
<i>Which means life is hard.</i>

24
00:02:11,384 --> 00:02:15,784
<i>And second, I have a highly developed
sense of taste and smell.</i>

25
00:02:17,184 --> 00:02:21,584
Flour, eggs, sugar, vanilla bean...

26
00:02:21,684 --> 00:02:23,784
Oh! Small twist of lemon.

27
00:02:23,884 --> 00:02:27,584
Whoa, you can smell all that?
You have a gift.

28
00:02:27,684 --> 00:02:31,084
<i>This is Emile, my brother.
He's easily impressed.</i>

29
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:34,784
So you can smell ingredients?
So what?

30
00:02:34,984 --> 00:02:37,884
<i>This is my dad. 
He's never impressed.</i>

31
00:02:38,384 --> 00:02:41,284
<i>He also happens to be
the leader of our clan.</i>

32
00:02:41,484 --> 00:02:44,784
<i>So, what's wrong
with having highly developed senses?</i>

33
00:02:44,884 --> 00:02:49,084
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Don't eat that!
- What's going on here?

34
00:02:49,684 --> 00:02:53,084
<i>Turns out that funny smell
was rat poison.</i>

35
00:02:53,184 --> 00:02:56,584
<i>Suddenly, Dad didn't think
my talent was useless.</i>

36
00:02:56,684 --> 00:02:59,084
<i>I was feeling pretty 
good about my gift,</i>

37
00:02:59,184 --> 00:03:01,584
<i>until Dad gave me a job.</i>

38
00:03:02,084 --> 00:03:03,384
Clean.

39
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:04,684
Clean.

40
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:06,184
<i>That's right. Poison checker.</i>

41
00:03:06,284 --> 00:03:07,384
Cleanerific.

42
00:03:07,584 --> 00:03:08,984
Cleanerino.

43
00:03:09,484 --> 00:03:11,184
Close to godliness.

44
00:03:12,184 --> 00:03:16,484
Which means clean.
You know, cleanliness is close to...

45
00:03:16,684 --> 00:03:18,384
Never mind. Move on.

46
00:03:19,084 --> 00:03:20,984
<i>Well, it made my dad proud.</i>

47
00:03:21,084 --> 00:03:25,684
Now, don't you feel better, Remy?
You've helped a noble cause.

48
00:03:25,884 --> 00:03:28,384
Noble? We're thieves, Dad.

49
00:03:28,484 --> 00:03:32,084
And what we're stealing is,
let's face it, garbage.

50
00:03:32,184 --> 00:03:34,184
It isn't stealing if no one wants it.

51
00:03:34,284 --> 00:03:36,784
If no one wants it,
why are we stealing it?

52
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:39,884
<i>Let's just say
we have different points of view.</i>

53
00:03:40,984 --> 00:03:42,484
<i>This much I knew:</i>

54
00:03:42,584 --> 00:03:46,484
<i>If you are what you eat,
then I only want to eat the good stuff.</i>

55
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:48,184
<i>But to my dad...</i>

56
00:03:48,284 --> 00:03:49,384
Food is fuel.

57
00:03:49,484 --> 00:03:53,084
You get picky about what you put
in the tank, your engine is gonna die.

58
00:03:53,184 --> 00:03:54,784
Now shut up and eat your garbage.

59
00:03:54,884 --> 00:03:56,384
Look, if we're going to be thieves,

60
00:03:56,484 --> 00:03:58,384
why not steal the good stuff
in the kitchen,

61
00:03:58,484 --> 00:04:00,084
where nothing is poisoned?

62
00:04:00,184 --> 00:04:02,684
First of all, we are not thieves.

63
00:04:02,884 --> 00:04:05,684
Secondly, stay out of the kitchen
and away from the humans.

64
00:04:05,784 --> 00:04:06,984
It's dangerous.

65
00:04:07,084 --> 00:04:08,884
<i>I know
I'm supposed to hate humans,</i>

66
00:04:08,984 --> 00:04:10,984
<i>but there's something about them.</i>

67
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:15,484
<i>They don't just survive.
They discover, they create.</i>

68
00:04:15,784 --> 00:04:17,984
<i>I mean,
just look at what they do with food.</i>

69
00:04:18,084 --> 00:04:19,584
<i>How can I describe it?</i>

70
00:04:19,684 --> 00:04:23,684
<i>Good food is like music you can taste,
color you can smell.</i>

71
00:04:23,784 --> 00:04:26,184
<i>There is excellence all around you.</i>

72
00:04:26,284 --> 00:04:29,884
<i>You need only be aware to stop
and savor it.</i>

73
00:04:33,784 --> 00:04:35,984
<i>Oh, Gusteau was right.</i>

74
00:04:36,284 --> 00:04:38,784
<i>Oh, mmm, yeah.</i>

75
00:04:39,184 --> 00:04:40,784
<i>Oh, amazing.</i>

76
00:04:41,484 --> 00:04:44,684
<i>Each flavor was totally unique.</i>

77
00:04:48,784 --> 00:04:51,984
<i>But combine one flavor with another,</i>

78
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:54,784
<i>and something new was created.</i>

79
00:05:00,484 --> 00:05:02,984
<i>So now I had a secret life.</i>

80
00:05:10,884 --> 00:05:13,484
<i>The only one who knew about it
was Emile.</i>

81
00:05:13,784 --> 00:05:15,984
Hey, Emile. Emile.

82
00:05:16,284 --> 00:05:18,284
I found a mushroom.

83
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:21,684
Come on, you're good at hiding food.
Help me find a good place to put this.

84
00:05:22,184 --> 00:05:25,284
<i>He doesn't understand me,
but I can be myself around him.</i>

85
00:05:25,384 --> 00:05:27,084
Why are you walking like that?

86
00:05:27,184 --> 00:05:30,184
I don't want to constantly
have to wash my paws.

87
00:05:30,284 --> 00:05:32,284
Did you ever think about how we walk
on the same paws

88
00:05:32,384 --> 00:05:33,584
that we handle food with?

89
00:05:33,684 --> 00:05:35,784
You ever think about
what we put into our mouths?

90
00:05:35,884 --> 00:05:36,984
All the time.

91
00:05:37,084 --> 00:05:39,584
When I eat, I don't want to taste
everywhere my paws have been.

92
00:05:39,784 --> 00:05:40,884
Well, go ahead.

93
00:05:40,984 --> 00:05:43,584
But if Dad sees you walking like that,
he's not going to like it.

94
00:05:44,784 --> 00:05:46,684
What have you got there?

95
00:05:46,984 --> 00:05:47,984
Ah, oh, oh...

96
00:05:49,384 --> 00:05:51,084
You found cheese?

97
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:55,984
And not just any cheese.
Tomme de chèvre de pays!

98
00:05:56,184 --> 00:05:58,684
That would go beautifully
with my mushroom.

99
00:05:58,784 --> 00:05:59,684
And...

100
00:06:01,984 --> 00:06:05,184
This rosemary! This rosemary

101
00:06:05,284 --> 00:06:08,884
with maybe with a few drops
from this sweet grass.

102
00:06:09,384 --> 00:06:12,384
Well, throw it on the pile, I guess,
and then we'II... You know...

103
00:06:12,484 --> 00:06:16,884
We don't want to throw this in
with the garbage. This is special.

104
00:06:16,984 --> 00:06:18,684
But we're supposed
to return to the colony

105
00:06:18,784 --> 00:06:20,284
before sundown or,
you know, Dad's gonna...

106
00:06:20,384 --> 00:06:21,484
Emile!

107
00:06:21,584 --> 00:06:23,484
There are possibilities
unexplored here.

108
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:25,084
We got to cook this.

109
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:29,584
Now, exactly how we cook this
is the real question...

110
00:06:30,884 --> 00:06:31,884
Yeah.

111
00:06:32,584 --> 00:06:34,784
The key is to keep turning it.

112
00:06:34,884 --> 00:06:38,284
Get the smoky flavor nice and even.

113
00:06:39,584 --> 00:06:41,784
That storm's getting closer.

114
00:06:42,084 --> 00:06:46,784
Hey, Remy, you think that maybe
we shouldn't be so...

115
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,084
You got to taste this!

116
00:07:00,184 --> 00:07:04,484
This is... It's got this kind of...
It's burny, melty...

117
00:07:04,584 --> 00:07:07,484
It's not really a smoky taste.
It's a certain... It's kind of like a...

118
00:07:08,684 --> 00:07:12,584
It's got, like, this "ba-boom, zap"
kind of taste. Don't you think?

119
00:07:12,684 --> 00:07:15,884
- What would you call that flavor?
- Lightning-y?

120
00:07:16,184 --> 00:07:20,584
Yeah. It's lightning-y!
We got to do that again.

121
00:07:20,784 --> 00:07:23,384
Okay, when the next storm comes,
we'll go up on the roof...

122
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:26,984
I know what this needs! Saffron!
A little saffron would make this!

123
00:07:27,084 --> 00:07:29,584
Saffron. Why do I get the feeling

124
00:07:29,684 --> 00:07:31,584
- it's in the kitchen?
- It's in the kitchen.

125
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:40,684
Saffron.
- Not good.

126
00:07:40,784 --> 00:07:42,284
Saffron.

127
00:07:42,384 --> 00:07:46,184
Don't like it. She's gonna wake up.

128
00:07:46,284 --> 00:07:47,784
I've been down here a million times.

129
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,984
She turns on the cooking channel,
boom, she never wakes up.

130
00:07:51,184 --> 00:07:53,084
You've been here a million times?

131
00:07:53,284 --> 00:07:56,784
I'm telling you, saffron will be
just the thing. Gusteau swears by it.

132
00:07:57,084 --> 00:07:58,884
Okay. Who's Gusteau?

133
00:07:58,984 --> 00:08:02,184
Just the greatest chef in the world.
Wrote this cookbook.

134
00:08:02,284 --> 00:08:05,184
Wait. You read?

135
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:10,084
- Well, not excessively.
- Oh, man. Does Dad know?

136
00:08:10,184 --> 00:08:14,784
You could fill a book, a lot
of books, with things Dad doesn't know.

137
00:08:14,884 --> 00:08:18,984
And they have, which is why I read.
Which is also our secret.

138
00:08:19,184 --> 00:08:20,584
I don't like secrets.

139
00:08:20,684 --> 00:08:24,484
All this cooking
and reading and TV-watching

140
00:08:24,684 --> 00:08:26,884
while we read and cook.

141
00:08:27,084 --> 00:08:30,084
It's like you're involving me in crime,
and I let you.

142
00:08:30,284 --> 00:08:31,684
Why do I let you?

143
00:08:36,284 --> 00:08:38,384
What's taking those kids so long?

144
00:08:39,484 --> 00:08:42,484
Ah, I'Aquila saffron. Italian. Huh?

145
00:08:42,684 --> 00:08:46,284
Gusteau says it's excellent.
Good thing the old lady is a food love...

146
00:08:46,384 --> 00:08:49,084
<i>Forget mystique.
This is about your cooking.</i>

147
00:08:49,184 --> 00:08:51,684
Hey! That's Gusteau. Emile, look.

148
00:08:51,784 --> 00:08:52,184
<i>Great cooking
is not for the faint of heart.</i>

149
00:08:52,184 --> 00:08:54,284
<i>Great cooking
is not for the faint of heart.</i>

150
00:08:54,384 --> 00:08:56,984
<i>You must be imaginative,
strong hearted.</i>

151
00:08:57,184 --> 00:08:59,184
<i>You must try things that may not work.</i>

152
00:08:59,284 --> 00:09:01,384
<i>And you must not let anyone
define your limits</i>

153
00:09:01,484 --> 00:09:03,584
<i>because of where you come from.</i>

154
00:09:03,784 --> 00:09:05,984
<i>Your only limit is your soul.</i>

155
00:09:06,084 --> 00:09:13,084
<i>What I say is true. Anyone can cook.
But only the fearless can be great.</i>

156
00:09:13,784 --> 00:09:15,184
Pure poetry.

157
00:09:15,284 --> 00:09:17,284
<i>But it was not to last.</i>

158
00:09:17,684 --> 00:09:20,584
<i>Gusteau's restaurant lost
one of its five stars</i>

159
00:09:20,684 --> 00:09:25,284
<i>after a scathing review
by France's top food critic, Anton Ego.</i>

160
00:09:25,884 --> 00:09:27,984
<i>It was a severe blow to Gusteau,</i>

161
00:09:28,084 --> 00:09:31,184
<i>and the brokenhearted chef
died shortly afterwards,</i>

162
00:09:31,284 --> 00:09:35,384
<i>which, according to tradition,
meant the loss of another star.</i>

163
00:09:35,584 --> 00:09:37,984
Gusteau is dead?

164
00:09:38,984 --> 00:09:39,984
Oh!

165
00:09:41,784 --> 00:09:43,684
Oh! Oh!

166
00:09:49,484 --> 00:09:50,884
Oh!

167
00:09:52,184 --> 00:09:53,384
Run!

168
00:09:55,984 --> 00:09:58,084
No, you'll lead her to the colony!

169
00:10:16,984 --> 00:10:19,784
- Help, Remy, help!
- Emile! Start swinging the light!

170
00:10:19,784 --> 00:10:20,084
- Help, Remy, help!
- Emile! Start swinging the light!

171
00:10:22,284 --> 00:10:23,784
Try to grab you.

172
00:10:27,184 --> 00:10:29,084
Emile, swing to me.

173
00:11:02,784 --> 00:11:06,184
Evacuate! Everyone, to the boats.

174
00:11:10,284 --> 00:11:12,184
Let me through!
- The book.

175
00:11:12,184 --> 00:11:12,784
Let me through!
- The book.

176
00:11:14,084 --> 00:11:16,284
Excuse me. Move, move.

177
00:11:31,684 --> 00:11:34,784
Go, go, go, go. Move, move, move.

178
00:11:35,684 --> 00:11:38,584
Get the bridge up! Move it, move it!

179
00:11:39,284 --> 00:11:40,684
Hey, Johnny! Hurry!

180
00:11:40,884 --> 00:11:42,384
Push off. Come on.

181
00:11:43,484 --> 00:11:44,584
Get hold!

182
00:11:48,384 --> 00:11:51,284
- Take the baby. Here!
- Give me your paw.

183
00:11:52,284 --> 00:11:53,884
Hey, wait for me!

184
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:00,984
Is everybody here?
Do we have everybody?

185
00:12:01,084 --> 00:12:03,584
- Wait a minute. Where's Remy?
- Right here. I'm coming.

186
00:12:04,184 --> 00:12:05,484
I'm coming!

187
00:12:06,384 --> 00:12:09,384
Hold on, Son.
Give him something to grab on to.

188
00:12:09,584 --> 00:12:11,584
Come on, boy. Paddle, Son.

189
00:12:11,684 --> 00:12:13,584
Come on. Reach for it.

190
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:15,784
You can do it.

191
00:12:19,984 --> 00:12:21,384
- Remy!
- Dad!

192
00:12:21,584 --> 00:12:24,284
Come on. You can make it.
You can make it.

193
00:12:30,284 --> 00:12:32,184
Guys, wait. Stop!

194
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:34,384
Remy. Come on. Paddle.

195
00:12:34,484 --> 00:12:38,184
Hold on! Wait for me. Hold on.

196
00:12:40,784 --> 00:12:41,984
Dad?

197
00:12:45,184 --> 00:12:46,084
Dad?

198
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,484
Which way?

199
00:13:48,984 --> 00:13:50,384
<i>I waited</i>

200
00:13:52,884 --> 00:13:54,284
<i>for a sound,</i>

201
00:13:56,684 --> 00:13:58,184
<i>a voice,</i>

202
00:14:00,484 --> 00:14:01,984
<i>a sign,</i>

203
00:14:04,384 --> 00:14:05,884
<i>something.</i>

204
00:14:24,684 --> 00:14:28,484
If you are hungry,
go up and look around, Remy.

205
00:14:30,784 --> 00:14:32,784
Why do you wait and mope?

206
00:14:33,284 --> 00:14:37,484
Well, I've just lost my family,
all my friends,

207
00:14:38,684 --> 00:14:40,184
probably forever.

208
00:14:40,584 --> 00:14:43,284
- How do you know?
- Well, I...

209
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:47,684
You are an illustration.
Why am I talking to you?

210
00:14:47,884 --> 00:14:52,584
Well, you just lost your family,
all your friends. You are Ionely.

211
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:54,884
Yeah. Well, you're dead.

212
00:14:54,984 --> 00:14:58,384
Ah, but that is no match
for wishful thinking.

213
00:14:58,484 --> 00:15:00,184
If you focus on what you've left behind,

214
00:15:00,284 --> 00:15:02,684
you'll never be able to see
what lies ahead.

215
00:15:02,784 --> 00:15:04,984
Now go up and look around.

216
00:15:35,384 --> 00:15:36,684
Oh!

217
00:15:42,084 --> 00:15:43,284
Champagne!

218
00:15:44,684 --> 00:15:45,784
What are you doing?

219
00:15:46,984 --> 00:15:48,084
I'm hungry.

220
00:15:48,284 --> 00:15:49,684
I don't know where I am,

221
00:15:49,784 --> 00:15:51,484
and I don't know
when I'll find food again.

222
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:55,184
Remy, you are better than that.
You are a cook.

223
00:15:55,384 --> 00:16:00,284
A cook makes. A thief takes.
You are not a thief.

224
00:16:00,984 --> 00:16:02,684
But I am hungry.

225
00:16:04,384 --> 00:16:05,984
Food will come, Remy.

226
00:16:06,084 --> 00:16:10,684
Food always comes
to those who love to cook.

227
00:16:22,784 --> 00:16:25,084
- You think I am playing?
- You don't have the guts.

228
00:17:12,484 --> 00:17:13,584
Paris?

229
00:17:14,184 --> 00:17:17,684
All this time
I've been underneath Paris?

230
00:17:19,884 --> 00:17:20,984
Wow.

231
00:17:23,784 --> 00:17:25,484
It's beautiful.

232
00:17:26,684 --> 00:17:29,284
The most beautiful.

233
00:17:29,584 --> 00:17:32,184
Gusteau's? Your restaurant?

234
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:34,684
You've led me to your restaurant.

235
00:17:35,784 --> 00:17:40,984
It seems as though I have. Yes.
There it is! I have led you to it!

236
00:17:41,084 --> 00:17:42,484
I got to see this.

237
00:17:43,084 --> 00:17:44,684
Ready to go on table seven.
Coming around.

238
00:17:44,784 --> 00:17:46,484
One order of steamed pike up.
Coming up.

239
00:17:46,584 --> 00:17:48,284
I need
more soup bowls, please.

240
00:17:48,384 --> 00:17:50,984
I need two rack of lamb.
I need more leeks.

241
00:17:51,184 --> 00:17:54,384
I need two salmon, three
salade composée, and three filet.

242
00:17:54,484 --> 00:17:56,384
Three orders
of salade composée working.

243
00:17:56,484 --> 00:17:58,184
Firing two orders, seared salmon.

244
00:17:58,284 --> 00:18:00,684
Three filet working. I need plates.

245
00:18:00,984 --> 00:18:03,584
Fire seven.
Three salade composée up.

246
00:18:03,684 --> 00:18:05,584
Don't mess with my mise!

247
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:06,984
Open down low.

248
00:18:07,084 --> 00:18:09,984
I'm getting buried here.

249
00:18:10,184 --> 00:18:12,884
Hello, Chef Skinner.
How your night be now?

250
00:18:12,984 --> 00:18:14,984
<i>Bonjour, chef.
Hello, Chef Skinner.</i>

251
00:18:15,084 --> 00:18:17,584
<i>- Evening, chef.
Ordering deux filet.</i>

252
00:18:17,684 --> 00:18:19,584
Hey, boss, look who is here.

253
00:18:19,684 --> 00:18:22,084
Alfredo Linguini, Renata's little boy.

254
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,784
- Hi.
- All grown up, eh?

255
00:18:23,884 --> 00:18:26,384
You remember Renata,
Gusteau's old flame?

256
00:18:27,784 --> 00:18:30,884
- Yes. How are you...
- Linguini.

257
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:35,184
Yes, Linguini. So nice of you to visit.
How is...

258
00:18:35,284 --> 00:18:37,084
- My mother?
- Renata.

259
00:18:37,184 --> 00:18:40,084
- Yes, Renata. How is she?
- Good.

260
00:18:40,384 --> 00:18:43,784
Well, not... She's been better. I mean...

261
00:18:43,884 --> 00:18:45,084
She died.

262
00:18:45,684 --> 00:18:46,884
Oh.

263
00:18:47,284 --> 00:18:48,384
I'm sorry.

264
00:18:48,484 --> 00:18:52,084
Oh, don't be. She believed in heaven,
so she's covered.

265
00:18:52,284 --> 00:18:54,784
You know, afterlife-wise?

266
00:19:03,584 --> 00:19:06,684
- What's this?
- She left it for you.

267
00:19:06,884 --> 00:19:10,284
I think she hoped it would help me,

268
00:19:10,384 --> 00:19:12,784
you know, get a job here.

269
00:19:12,884 --> 00:19:15,484
But of course.
Gusteau wouldn't hesitate.

270
00:19:15,584 --> 00:19:16,684
Any son of Renata's is more than...

271
00:19:16,784 --> 00:19:20,384
Yes, well, we could file this
and if something suitable opens up...

272
00:19:20,484 --> 00:19:21,584
We have already hired him.

273
00:19:21,684 --> 00:19:25,384
What? How dare you hire someone
without my...

274
00:19:25,484 --> 00:19:27,284
We needed a garbage boy.

275
00:19:27,984 --> 00:19:30,384
Oh, garbage. Well...

276
00:19:30,584 --> 00:19:32,284
I'm glad it worked out.

277
00:19:35,584 --> 00:19:36,784
Uh...

278
00:19:42,084 --> 00:19:43,484
I can't believe it.

279
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:46,884
A real gourmet kitchen,
and I get to watch.

280
00:19:47,084 --> 00:19:50,184
You've read my book.
Let us see how much you know, huh?

281
00:19:50,384 --> 00:19:51,984
Which one is the chef?

282
00:19:52,084 --> 00:19:53,984
Oh! Uh...

283
00:19:54,384 --> 00:19:56,784
- Oh, that guy.
- Very good.

284
00:19:56,984 --> 00:19:58,484
Who is next in command?

285
00:19:58,584 --> 00:20:01,384
The sous chef. There.

286
00:20:01,684 --> 00:20:05,584
The sous is responsible for the kitchen
when the chef's not around.

287
00:20:05,884 --> 00:20:09,284
Saucier, in charge of sauces.
Very important.

288
00:20:09,484 --> 00:20:13,584
Chef de partie, demi chef de partie,
both important.

289
00:20:13,684 --> 00:20:16,484
Commis, commis, they're cooks.
Very important.

290
00:20:16,684 --> 00:20:19,784
You are a clever rat. Now, who is that?

291
00:20:20,484 --> 00:20:22,584
Oh, him? He's nobody.

292
00:20:22,684 --> 00:20:24,784
Not nobody. He is part of the kitchen.

293
00:20:24,884 --> 00:20:26,684
<i>No, he's a plongeur or something.</i>

294
00:20:26,784 --> 00:20:29,284
He washes dishes or takes out
the garbage. He doesn't cook.

295
00:20:29,384 --> 00:20:32,684
- But he could.
- Uh, no.

296
00:20:32,784 --> 00:20:34,984
How do you know?
What do I always say?

297
00:20:35,084 --> 00:20:36,684
Anyone can cook.

298
00:20:36,784 --> 00:20:40,784
Well, yeah, anyone can.
That doesn't mean that anyone should.

299
00:20:40,884 --> 00:20:44,384
Well,
that is not stopping him. See?

300
00:20:45,184 --> 00:20:49,884
What is he doing?
No. No! No, this is terrible!

301
00:20:51,684 --> 00:20:55,284
He's ruining the soup.
And nobody's noticing?

302
00:20:55,484 --> 00:20:57,384
It's your restaurant. Do something.

303
00:20:57,484 --> 00:21:00,684
What can I do?
I am a figment of your imagination.

304
00:21:00,784 --> 00:21:01,984
But he's ruining the soup!
We got to tell someone that he's...

305
00:21:01,984 --> 00:21:03,684
But he's ruining the soup!
We got to tell someone that he's...

306
00:21:11,084 --> 00:21:13,884
Table five coming up,
right now.

307
00:21:21,284 --> 00:21:23,084
Coming down the line.
Set.

308
00:21:24,584 --> 00:21:25,884
Ah!

309
00:21:32,184 --> 00:21:34,184
Hot! Open oven!

310
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:43,184
Ah!

311
00:21:51,884 --> 00:21:53,484
Coming around.

312
00:22:09,484 --> 00:22:10,684
Ooh!

313
00:22:14,084 --> 00:22:17,484
<i>Oui, chef.
One filet mignon, three lamb, two duck.</i>

314
00:22:38,084 --> 00:22:40,684
<i>Fire those soufflés
for table six, ja.</i>

315
00:22:40,884 --> 00:22:42,784
Five minutes, chef.
- Oh, God.

316
00:22:48,184 --> 00:22:50,584
Tonight,
I'd like to present the foie gras.

317
00:22:50,684 --> 00:22:52,184
It has a wonderful finish.

318
00:22:52,284 --> 00:22:53,484
Ooh!
- Ah!

319
00:22:56,884 --> 00:22:57,784
Hmm.

320
00:23:11,584 --> 00:23:13,984
Ready to go on table seven.
Come on! Let's go!

321
00:23:14,084 --> 00:23:15,184
<i>Oui, chef.</i>

322
00:23:56,884 --> 00:23:58,784
Remy! What are you waiting for?

323
00:23:58,984 --> 00:24:00,784
Is this going to become a regular thing
with you?

324
00:24:00,884 --> 00:24:03,484
You know how to fix it.
This is your chance.

325
00:24:58,384 --> 00:25:02,784
The soup! Where is the soup?
Out of my way.

326
00:25:03,384 --> 00:25:05,484
Move it, garbage boy!

327
00:25:06,284 --> 00:25:08,784
You are cooking?

328
00:25:08,984 --> 00:25:12,484
How dare you cook in my kitchen?

329
00:25:12,584 --> 00:25:14,584
Where do you get the gall

330
00:25:14,684 --> 00:25:18,384
to even attempt something
so monumentally idiotic?

331
00:25:18,484 --> 00:25:20,484
I should have you drawn
and quartered!

332
00:25:20,584 --> 00:25:23,684
I'll do it. I think the law is on my side.

333
00:25:24,784 --> 00:25:26,284
Larousse, draw and quarter this man

334
00:25:26,384 --> 00:25:31,584
after you put him in the duck press
to squeeze the fat out of his head.

335
00:25:31,684 --> 00:25:34,784
- What are you blathering about?
- The soup!

336
00:25:37,084 --> 00:25:38,384
Soup?

337
00:25:39,084 --> 00:25:40,684
Stop that soup!

338
00:25:40,984 --> 00:25:44,684
No!

339
00:25:59,084 --> 00:26:00,184
Waiter.

340
00:26:01,784 --> 00:26:04,084
Linguini!

341
00:26:04,284 --> 00:26:05,784
You're fired!

342
00:26:05,984 --> 00:26:08,884
F-l-R-E-D! Fired!

343
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,284
She wants to see the chef.

344
00:26:11,384 --> 00:26:13,484
But he...

345
00:26:28,884 --> 00:26:32,784
- What did the customer say?
- It was not a customer. It was a critic.

346
00:26:32,884 --> 00:26:34,984
- Ego?
- Solene LeClaire.

347
00:26:35,084 --> 00:26:39,184
- LeClaire? What did she say?
- She likes the soup.

348
00:26:39,384 --> 00:26:40,984
- Wait.
- What do you mean, "Wait"?

349
00:26:41,084 --> 00:26:42,684
You're the reason I'm in this mess.

350
00:26:42,784 --> 00:26:44,184
Someone is asking about your soup.

351
00:26:54,284 --> 00:26:56,884
What are you playing at?

352
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,584
Am I still fired?

353
00:27:00,684 --> 00:27:02,784
You can't fire him.
- What?

354
00:27:02,884 --> 00:27:06,184
LeClaire likes it, yeah?
She made a point of telling you so.

355
00:27:06,284 --> 00:27:07,584
If she write a review to that effect

356
00:27:07,684 --> 00:27:09,684
and find out you fired
the cook responsible...

357
00:27:09,784 --> 00:27:12,984
- He's a garbage boy.
- Who made something she liked.

358
00:27:13,084 --> 00:27:15,284
How can we claim to represent
the name of Gusteau

359
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:17,584
if we don't uphold
his most cherished belief?

360
00:27:17,683 --> 00:27:20,584
<i>And what belief is that,
Mademoiselle Tatou?</i>

361
00:27:20,684 --> 00:27:21,684
Anyone can cook.

362
00:27:26,584 --> 00:27:32,284
Perhaps I have been a bit harsh
on our new garbage boy.

363
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:34,884
He has taken a bold risk

364
00:27:34,984 --> 00:27:39,384
and we should reward that,
as Chef Gusteau would have.

365
00:27:39,784 --> 00:27:42,784
If he wishes
to swim in dangerous waters,

366
00:27:42,784 --> 00:27:44,284
who are we to deny him?

367
00:27:45,484 --> 00:27:47,784
- You were escaping?
- Oh, yeah.

368
00:27:47,884 --> 00:27:51,984
Since you have expressed
such an interest in his cooking career,

369
00:27:52,184 --> 00:27:53,484
you shall be responsible for it.

370
00:27:55,584 --> 00:27:57,084
Anyone else?

371
00:27:59,084 --> 00:28:00,884
Then back to work.

372
00:28:01,584 --> 00:28:05,184
You are either very lucky
or very unlucky.

373
00:28:05,384 --> 00:28:10,784
You will make the soup again,
and this time, I'll be paying attention.

374
00:28:10,984 --> 00:28:13,784
Very close attention.

375
00:28:14,084 --> 00:28:18,484
They think you might be a cook.
But you know what I think, Linguini?

376
00:28:18,784 --> 00:28:22,084
I think you are a sneaky,
overreaching little...

377
00:28:23,384 --> 00:28:24,584
Rat!

378
00:28:27,084 --> 00:28:28,584
- Rat!
Get the rat.

379
00:28:28,784 --> 00:28:30,784
Linguini. Get something to trap it.

380
00:28:30,984 --> 00:28:32,484
It's getting away.
Get it, get it, get it.

381
00:28:33,284 --> 00:28:35,084
- What should I do now?
- Kill it.

382
00:28:35,184 --> 00:28:37,784
- Now?
- No, not in the kitchen. Are you mad?

383
00:28:37,884 --> 00:28:39,484
Do you know what would happen to us

384
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:41,984
if anyone knew
we had a rat in our kitchen?

385
00:28:42,084 --> 00:28:43,784
They'd close us down.

386
00:28:43,884 --> 00:28:46,284
Our reputation is hanging by a thread
as it is.

387
00:28:46,384 --> 00:28:50,484
Take it away from here. Far away.
Kill it. Dispose of it. Go!

388
00:28:51,284 --> 00:28:52,784
Whoa!

389
00:28:56,384 --> 00:28:57,384
Doh!

390
00:29:27,184 --> 00:29:30,984
Don't look at me like that!
You aren't the only one who's trapped.

391
00:29:31,084 --> 00:29:33,184
They expect me to cook it again!

392
00:29:33,484 --> 00:29:36,184
I mean, I'm not ambitious.
I wasn't trying to cook.

393
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:38,484
I was just trying to stay out of trouble.

394
00:29:38,584 --> 00:29:41,584
You're the one who was getting fancy
with the spices!

395
00:29:41,684 --> 00:29:46,584
What did you throw in there? Oregano?
No? What? Rosemary?

396
00:29:46,884 --> 00:29:49,384
That's a spice, isn't it? Rosemary?

397
00:29:49,884 --> 00:29:52,384
You didn't throw rosemary in there?

398
00:29:52,684 --> 00:29:56,784
Then what was all the flipping
and all the throwing the...

399
00:30:00,784 --> 00:30:04,184
I need this job. I've lost so many.

400
00:30:04,584 --> 00:30:08,684
I don't know how to cook, and now
I'm actually talking to a rat as if you...

401
00:30:09,884 --> 00:30:11,184
Did you nod?

402
00:30:11,284 --> 00:30:13,384
Have you been nodding?

403
00:30:14,884 --> 00:30:16,584
You understand me?

404
00:30:17,184 --> 00:30:18,784
So I'm not crazy!

405
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:22,084
Wait a second, wait a second.

406
00:30:23,184 --> 00:30:25,884
I can't cook, can I?

407
00:30:27,884 --> 00:30:29,584
But you...

408
00:30:30,284 --> 00:30:33,084
You can, right?

409
00:30:34,284 --> 00:30:36,784
Look, don't be so modest.
You're a rat, for Pete's sake.

410
00:30:36,884 --> 00:30:39,284
Whatever you did, they liked it.

411
00:30:39,884 --> 00:30:42,484
Yeah. This could work.

412
00:30:43,284 --> 00:30:44,584
Hey, they liked the soup!

413
00:30:48,084 --> 00:30:53,084
They liked the soup.
Do you think you could do it again?

414
00:30:56,684 --> 00:30:59,184
Okay, I'm going to let you out now.

415
00:30:59,984 --> 00:31:03,084
But we're together on this. Right?

416
00:31:04,784 --> 00:31:06,284
Okay.

417
00:32:16,584 --> 00:32:18,484
So this is it.

418
00:32:18,984 --> 00:32:22,884
I mean, it's not much, but it's,
you know...

419
00:32:25,084 --> 00:32:26,384
Not much.

420
00:32:28,884 --> 00:32:30,184
It could be worse.

421
00:32:30,284 --> 00:32:32,684
There's heat and light
and a couch with a TV.

422
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:35,184
So, you know, what's mine is yours.

423
00:32:36,184 --> 00:32:37,584
<i>Are you...</i>

424
00:32:37,684 --> 00:32:39,984
<i>Is this a dream?</i>

425
00:32:40,084 --> 00:32:42,384
<i>The best kind of dream.</i>

426
00:32:42,784 --> 00:32:43,984
<i>One we can share.</i>

427
00:32:45,184 --> 00:32:46,784
<i>But why here?</i>

428
00:32:47,284 --> 00:32:48,884
<i>Why now?</i>

429
00:32:49,784 --> 00:32:51,484
<i>Why not here?</i>

430
00:32:51,784 --> 00:32:53,484
<i>Why not now?</i>

431
00:32:54,384 --> 00:32:58,384
<i>What better place to dream
than in Paris?</i>

432
00:33:11,584 --> 00:33:13,784
Morning, Little Chef. Rise and...

433
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:16,484
Oh, no.

434
00:33:18,384 --> 00:33:19,784
Idiot! I knew this would happen!

435
00:33:19,884 --> 00:33:22,684
I let a rat into my place
and tell him what's mine is his!

436
00:33:22,784 --> 00:33:23,984
Eggs, gone!

437
00:33:24,084 --> 00:33:27,484
Stupid! He's stolen food
and hit the road! What did I expect?

438
00:33:27,584 --> 00:33:30,084
That's what I get for trusting a...

439
00:33:32,684 --> 00:33:34,484
Hi. Is that for me?

440
00:33:43,184 --> 00:33:44,384
Mmm!

441
00:33:44,584 --> 00:33:47,184
That's good. What did you put in this?

442
00:33:49,284 --> 00:33:50,784
Where'd you get that?

443
00:33:53,984 --> 00:33:58,684
Look, it's delicious. But don't steal.
I'll buy some spices, okay?

444
00:34:01,984 --> 00:34:05,384
Oh, no. We're going to be late.
And on the first day!

445
00:34:05,484 --> 00:34:06,684
Come on, Little Chef!

446
00:34:06,984 --> 00:34:08,784
"Though I, like many other critic,

447
00:34:08,884 --> 00:34:12,184
"had written off Gusteau as irrelevant
since the great chef's death,

448
00:34:12,284 --> 00:34:16,884
"the soup was a revelation.
A spicy yet subtle taste experience."

449
00:34:16,984 --> 00:34:18,984
- Solene LeClaire?
- Yes!

450
00:34:19,384 --> 00:34:23,584
"Against all odds,
Gusteau's has recaptured our attention.

451
00:34:23,684 --> 00:34:26,484
"Only time will tell if they deserve it."

452
00:34:29,284 --> 00:34:30,684
Well...

453
00:34:38,484 --> 00:34:39,784
You know.

454
00:34:42,884 --> 00:34:46,984
Look, I know it's stupid and weird,
but neither of us can do this alone,

455
00:34:47,084 --> 00:34:50,584
so we got to do it together, right?
You with me?

456
00:34:51,884 --> 00:34:54,284
So let's do this thing!

457
00:34:57,284 --> 00:34:58,584
I...

458
00:35:09,984 --> 00:35:15,484
Welcome to hell.
Now, recreate the soup.

459
00:35:15,684 --> 00:35:19,484
Take as much time as you need.
All week if you must.

460
00:35:20,084 --> 00:35:21,284
Soup.

461
00:35:34,184 --> 00:35:35,084
You little...

462
00:35:36,284 --> 00:35:37,384
Ow!

463
00:35:47,084 --> 00:35:48,284
You son of a...

464
00:35:56,184 --> 00:35:57,984
You got...

465
00:36:13,584 --> 00:36:15,484
This is not going to work, Little Chef!

466
00:36:15,584 --> 00:36:18,084
I'm going to lose it
if we do this anymore.

467
00:36:18,184 --> 00:36:20,684
We've got to figure out something else.

468
00:36:20,784 --> 00:36:22,984
Something that doesn't involve
any biting, or nipping,

469
00:36:23,084 --> 00:36:25,784
or running up and down my body
with your little rat feet.

470
00:36:25,884 --> 00:36:28,584
The biting! No! Scampering! No!

471
00:36:28,684 --> 00:36:31,884
No scampering or scurrying.
Understand, Little Chef?

472
00:36:33,184 --> 00:36:34,284
Little Chef?

473
00:36:36,484 --> 00:36:38,184
Oh, you're hungry.

474
00:36:45,584 --> 00:36:47,984
Okay. So let's think this out.

475
00:36:48,384 --> 00:36:52,584
You know how to cook,
and I know how to appear

476
00:36:53,384 --> 00:36:54,384
human.

477
00:36:54,584 --> 00:36:57,384
We need to work out a system
so that I do what you want

478
00:36:57,484 --> 00:37:00,584
in a way that doesn't look like
I'm being controlled by a tiny rat chef.

479
00:37:00,684 --> 00:37:02,784
Would you listen to me? I'm insane!
I'm insane! I'm insane!

480
00:37:02,884 --> 00:37:05,884
In a refrigerator talking to a rat
about cooking in a gourmet restaurant.

481
00:37:05,984 --> 00:37:07,784
- I will never pull this off!
- Linguini?

482
00:37:07,884 --> 00:37:08,884
We gotta communicate.

483
00:37:08,984 --> 00:37:13,184
I can't be constantly checking
for a yes or no head shake from a...

484
00:37:15,184 --> 00:37:16,984
The rat! I saw it!

485
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:20,284
- A rat?
- Yes, a rat. Right next to you.

486
00:37:21,284 --> 00:37:24,084
What are you doing in here?

487
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:29,284
I'm just familiarizing myself with,
you know, the vegetables and such.

488
00:37:29,384 --> 00:37:30,684
Get out.

489
00:37:32,384 --> 00:37:35,684
One can get too familiar
with vegetables, you know!

490
00:37:36,484 --> 00:37:39,484
That was close. Are you okay up there?

491
00:37:40,784 --> 00:37:42,184
Whoa!

492
00:37:51,884 --> 00:37:53,384
How did you do that?

493
00:38:07,484 --> 00:38:09,884
That's strangely involuntary!

494
00:38:11,884 --> 00:38:15,984
<i>One look and I knew
we had the same crazy idea.</i>

495
00:38:16,884 --> 00:38:18,484
Okay.

496
00:38:20,684 --> 00:38:21,784
Huh?

497
00:38:29,084 --> 00:38:31,884
Where are you taking me? Wait.

498
00:38:36,384 --> 00:38:37,584
Whoa!

499
00:38:40,684 --> 00:38:42,384
Wait. I'm sorry.

500
00:38:43,684 --> 00:38:45,084
Whoa!

501
00:38:47,084 --> 00:38:48,184
Okay.

502
00:38:49,184 --> 00:38:50,384
Mmm-hmm...

503
00:38:58,184 --> 00:38:59,184
Okay.

504
00:39:35,384 --> 00:39:37,084
Whoa!

505
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:56,584
Whoa!

506
00:39:59,084 --> 00:40:00,384
<i>À votre santé!</i>

507
00:40:06,184 --> 00:40:07,584
All right.

508
00:40:34,484 --> 00:40:35,784
That should do it.

509
00:40:38,384 --> 00:40:39,484
Mmm.

510
00:40:39,584 --> 00:40:44,584
Congratulations. You were able to
repeat your accidental success.

511
00:40:44,684 --> 00:40:49,384
But you'll need to know more than soup
if you are to survive in my kitchen, boy.

512
00:40:49,484 --> 00:40:53,984
Colette will be responsible for
teaching you how we do things here.

513
00:40:55,084 --> 00:40:57,484
Listen, I just want you to know

514
00:40:57,584 --> 00:41:00,384
how honored I am
to be studying under such...

515
00:41:00,484 --> 00:41:03,884
No! You listen. I just want you to know
exactly who you are dealing with.

516
00:41:03,984 --> 00:41:05,384
How many women
do you see in this kitchen?

517
00:41:05,484 --> 00:41:06,784
Well, I...

518
00:41:06,884 --> 00:41:09,284
- Only me. Why do you think that is?
- Well, I...

519
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:11,584
Because haute cuisine
is an antiquated hierarchy

520
00:41:11,684 --> 00:41:14,384
built upon rules
written by stupid old men.

521
00:41:14,484 --> 00:41:17,884
Rules designed to make it impossible
for women to enter this world.

522
00:41:18,084 --> 00:41:20,284
But still I'm here. How did this happen?

523
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:22,984
Because, well, because you...

524
00:41:23,084 --> 00:41:25,284
Because I am the toughest cook
in this kitchen.

525
00:41:25,384 --> 00:41:26,984
I've worked too hard
for too long to get here

526
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:30,084
and I am not going to jeopardize it
for some garbage boy who got lucky.

527
00:41:30,184 --> 00:41:31,384
Got it?

528
00:41:35,084 --> 00:41:36,084
Wow!

529
00:41:36,884 --> 00:41:40,984
Easy to cook. Easy
to eat. Gusteau makes Chinese food

530
00:41:41,084 --> 00:41:43,084
Chine-easy.

531
00:41:45,084 --> 00:41:48,784
- Excellent work, François, as usual.
- It's good, isn't it?

532
00:41:48,984 --> 00:41:53,184
I want you to work up something
for my latest frozen food concept.

533
00:41:53,284 --> 00:41:55,484
Gusteau's Corn Puppies.

534
00:41:55,584 --> 00:42:00,184
They're like corn dogs, only smaller.
Bite size.

535
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:01,484
What are corn dogs?

536
00:42:01,584 --> 00:42:01,684
Cheap sausages dipped in batter
and deep fried. You know, American.

537
00:42:01,684 --> 00:42:05,984
Cheap sausages dipped in batter
and deep fried. You know, American.

538
00:42:06,284 --> 00:42:07,384
Whip something up.

539
00:42:07,484 --> 00:42:11,084
Maybe Gusteau in overalls
and Huckleberry Tom hat.

540
00:42:11,184 --> 00:42:14,384
Or as a big ear of corn
in doggie make-up.

541
00:42:14,484 --> 00:42:18,384
Yes.
But, please, with dignity.

542
00:42:44,984 --> 00:42:46,184
Get my lawyer!

543
00:42:47,084 --> 00:42:49,184
Well, the will stipulates

544
00:42:49,284 --> 00:42:53,084
that if after a period of two years
from the date of death

545
00:42:53,184 --> 00:42:54,484
no heir appears,

546
00:42:54,584 --> 00:42:58,884
Gusteau's business interests
will pass to his sous chef. You.

547
00:42:58,984 --> 00:43:00,984
I know what the will stipulates.

548
00:43:01,084 --> 00:43:06,284
What I want to know is if this letter...
If this boy changes anything!

549
00:43:10,584 --> 00:43:12,484
There's not much resemblance.

550
00:43:12,584 --> 00:43:16,084
There's no resemblance at all.
He is not Gusteau's son.

551
00:43:16,284 --> 00:43:19,384
Gusteau had no children,
and what of the timing of all this?

552
00:43:19,484 --> 00:43:22,784
The deadline in the will
expires in less than a month!

553
00:43:22,984 --> 00:43:25,084
Suddenly,
some boy arrives with a letter

554
00:43:25,184 --> 00:43:30,084
from his recently deceased mother
claiming Gusteau is his father?

555
00:43:30,184 --> 00:43:31,684
Highly suspect!

556
00:43:31,784 --> 00:43:33,684
- This is Gusteau's?
- Yes, yes, yes.

557
00:43:33,784 --> 00:43:35,384
- May I?
- Of course.

558
00:43:35,484 --> 00:43:36,884
But the boy does not know.

559
00:43:36,984 --> 00:43:41,384
She claims she never told him,
or Gusteau, and asks that I not tell.

560
00:43:41,484 --> 00:43:45,484
- Why you? What does she want?
- A job for the boy.

561
00:43:45,584 --> 00:43:48,484
- Only a job?
- Well, yes.

562
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:51,084
Then what are you worried about?
If he works here,

563
00:43:51,184 --> 00:43:54,184
you'll be able to keep an eye on him
while I do a little digging.

564
00:43:54,284 --> 00:43:56,084
Find out how much of this is real.

565
00:43:56,184 --> 00:43:58,784
I will need you
to collect some DNA samples

566
00:43:58,884 --> 00:44:00,584
from the boy. Hair, maybe.

567
00:44:00,784 --> 00:44:05,084
Mark my words.
The whole thing is highly suspect.

568
00:44:05,884 --> 00:44:08,084
He knows something.

569
00:44:08,184 --> 00:44:12,284
Relax, he's a garbage boy.
I think you can handle him.

570
00:44:18,584 --> 00:44:19,784
What are you doing?

571
00:44:19,884 --> 00:44:21,784
I'm cutting vegetables.
I'm cutting vegetables?

572
00:44:21,884 --> 00:44:23,684
No! You waste energy and time!

573
00:44:23,784 --> 00:44:26,784
You think cooking is a cute job,
like Mommy in the kitchen?

574
00:44:26,884 --> 00:44:27,984
Well, Mommy never had to face

575
00:44:28,184 --> 00:44:29,684
the dinner rush when the orders
come flooding in,

576
00:44:29,784 --> 00:44:31,284
and every dish is different
and none are simple,

577
00:44:31,384 --> 00:44:32,684
and all of the different cooking times,

578
00:44:32,784 --> 00:44:33,984
but must arrive on the customer's table

579
00:44:34,084 --> 00:44:36,184
at exactly the same time,
hot and perfect!

580
00:44:36,284 --> 00:44:38,984
Every second counts,
and you cannot be Mommy!

581
00:44:41,584 --> 00:44:44,784
What is this? Keep your station clear!

582
00:44:44,884 --> 00:44:46,584
When the meal rush comes,
what will happen?

583
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,184
Messy stations slow things down.

584
00:44:48,284 --> 00:44:50,584
Food doesn't go, orders pile up.
Disaster.

585
00:44:50,684 --> 00:44:52,384
I'll make this easy to remember.

586
00:44:52,484 --> 00:44:55,984
Keep your station clear,
or I will kill you!

587
00:44:58,084 --> 00:45:00,384
Your sleeves
look like you threw up on them.

588
00:45:00,484 --> 00:45:03,184
Keep your hands and arms in,
close to the body. Like this. See?

589
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:04,384
Always return to this position.

590
00:45:04,484 --> 00:45:08,084
Cooks move fast. Sharp utensils,
hot metal, keep your arms in.

591
00:45:08,184 --> 00:45:11,084
You will minimize cuts and burns
and keep your sleeves clean.

592
00:45:11,184 --> 00:45:13,784
Mark of a chef:
Messy apron, clean sleeves.

593
00:45:13,884 --> 00:45:15,684
I know the Gusteau style cold.

594
00:45:15,784 --> 00:45:19,084
In every dish, Chef Gusteau
always has something unexpected.

595
00:45:19,184 --> 00:45:22,084
I will show you.
I memorize all his recipe.

596
00:45:22,184 --> 00:45:25,984
- Always do something unexpected.
- No. Follow the recipe.

597
00:45:26,084 --> 00:45:27,484
- But you just said that...
- No, no, no.

598
00:45:27,584 --> 00:45:30,884
It was his job to be unexpected.
It is our job to...

599
00:45:31,084 --> 00:45:32,984
- Follow his recipes.
- Follow the recipe.

600
00:45:33,084 --> 00:45:35,484
How do you tell how good bread is
without tasting it?

601
00:45:35,584 --> 00:45:39,784
Not the smell, not the look,
but the sound of the crust.

602
00:45:39,884 --> 00:45:40,784
Listen.

603
00:45:42,284 --> 00:45:45,784
Symphony of crackle.
Only great bread sound this way.

604
00:45:46,184 --> 00:45:49,084
The only way to get the best produce
is to have first pick of the day

605
00:45:49,184 --> 00:45:51,084
and there are only two way
to get first pick.

606
00:45:51,184 --> 00:45:54,984
Grow it yourself, or bribe a grower.

607
00:45:55,284 --> 00:45:57,884
<i>Voilà! The best restaurant get first pick.</i>

608
00:45:57,984 --> 00:46:01,984
People think haute cuisine is snooty.
So chef must also be snooty.

609
00:46:02,084 --> 00:46:05,984
But not so.
Lalo there ran away from home at 12.

610
00:46:06,084 --> 00:46:08,584
Got hired by circus people
as an acrobat.

611
00:46:08,684 --> 00:46:10,184
And then he get fired

612
00:46:10,284 --> 00:46:13,084
for messing around
with the ringmaster's daughter.

613
00:46:13,184 --> 00:46:14,884
Horst has done time.

614
00:46:14,984 --> 00:46:15,984
LINGUINl: What for?

615
00:46:16,084 --> 00:46:19,484
No one know for sure. He changes
the story every time you ask him.

616
00:46:19,584 --> 00:46:21,484
I defrauded a major corporation.

617
00:46:21,584 --> 00:46:25,084
I robbed the second largest bank
in France using only a ballpoint pen.

618
00:46:25,184 --> 00:46:27,784
I created a hole in the ozone
over Avignon.

619
00:46:27,884 --> 00:46:30,584
I killed a man with this thumb.

620
00:46:30,784 --> 00:46:32,784
Don't ever play cards
with Pompidou.

621
00:46:32,884 --> 00:46:36,384
He's been banned from Las Vegas
and Monte Carlo.

622
00:46:36,884 --> 00:46:39,984
- Larousse ran gun for the Resistance.
- Which resistance?

623
00:46:40,184 --> 00:46:43,084
He won't say.
Apparently, they didn't win.

624
00:46:43,484 --> 00:46:44,684
So you see.

625
00:46:44,784 --> 00:46:49,184
We are artist, pirate.
More than cooks are we.

626
00:46:49,284 --> 00:46:52,684
<i>- We?
- Oui. You are one of us now, oui?</i>

627
00:46:52,984 --> 00:46:57,484
<i>Oui. Thank you, by the way,
for all the advice about cooking.</i>

628
00:46:57,884 --> 00:47:00,284
- Thank you, too.
- For what?

629
00:47:00,584 --> 00:47:01,984
For taking it.

630
00:47:04,684 --> 00:47:05,984
Huh?

631
00:47:06,784 --> 00:47:07,984
The rat!

632
00:47:10,184 --> 00:47:13,184
- But he is a...
- I just dropped my keys.

633
00:47:16,884 --> 00:47:18,784
Have you decided this evening?

634
00:47:18,884 --> 00:47:22,884
- Your soup is excellent. But...
- But we order it every time.

635
00:47:22,984 --> 00:47:26,584
- What else do you have?
- Well, we have a very nice foie gras.

636
00:47:26,684 --> 00:47:27,784
I know about the foie gras.

637
00:47:27,884 --> 00:47:29,684
The old standby,
used to be famous for it.

638
00:47:29,784 --> 00:47:31,884
What does the chef have that's new?

639
00:47:33,784 --> 00:47:35,484
- Someone has asked what is new!
- New?

640
00:47:35,584 --> 00:47:36,584
Yes. What do I tell them?

641
00:47:36,684 --> 00:47:38,384
- Well, what did you tell them?
- I told them I would ask!

642
00:47:38,484 --> 00:47:39,784
What are you blathering about?

643
00:47:39,884 --> 00:47:41,984
- Customers are asking what is new.
- What should I tell them?

644
00:47:42,084 --> 00:47:44,584
- What did you tell them?
- I told them I would ask!

645
00:47:46,184 --> 00:47:47,484
This is simple.

646
00:47:47,584 --> 00:47:49,684
Just pull out an old Gusteau recipe,

647
00:47:49,784 --> 00:47:51,484
something we haven't made
in a while...

648
00:47:51,584 --> 00:47:55,384
They know about the old stuff.
They like Linguini's soup.

649
00:47:56,384 --> 00:48:01,084
They are asking for food from Linguini?

650
00:48:01,484 --> 00:48:03,984
A lot of customers like the soup.
That's all we are saying.

651
00:48:04,084 --> 00:48:05,584
Were we saying that?

652
00:48:06,484 --> 00:48:09,384
Very well. If it's Linguini they want

653
00:48:09,484 --> 00:48:14,084
tell them Chef Linguini has prepared
something special for them.

654
00:48:14,184 --> 00:48:17,284
Something definitely off menu.

655
00:48:17,684 --> 00:48:19,284
Oh, and don't forget to stress

656
00:48:19,384 --> 00:48:21,884
<i>- its Linguini-ness.
- Oui, chef.</i>

657
00:48:21,984 --> 00:48:26,084
Now is your chance to try something
worthy of your talent, Linguini.

658
00:48:26,184 --> 00:48:31,484
A forgotten favorite of the chef's,
sweetbread à la Gusteau.

659
00:48:31,584 --> 00:48:33,284
<i>- Colette will help you.
- Oui, chef.</i>

660
00:48:33,384 --> 00:48:36,184
Now, hurry up. Our diners are hungry.

661
00:48:36,684 --> 00:48:39,084
Are you sure?
That recipe was a disaster.

662
00:48:39,184 --> 00:48:40,984
Gusteau himself said so.

663
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:44,384
Just the sort of challenge
a budding chef needs.

664
00:48:44,784 --> 00:48:46,084
"Sweetbread à la Gusteau.

665
00:48:46,184 --> 00:48:48,684
"Sweetbread cooked
in a seaweed salt crust

666
00:48:48,784 --> 00:48:51,784
"with cuttlefish tentacle,
dog rose purée,

667
00:48:51,884 --> 00:48:54,384
"geoduck egg, dried white fungus?

668
00:48:54,484 --> 00:48:57,284
"Anchovy licorice sauce."

669
00:48:57,584 --> 00:49:00,684
I don't know this recipe,
but it's Gusteau's, so...

670
00:49:00,784 --> 00:49:03,384
Lalo! We have
some veal stomach soaking, yes?

671
00:49:03,484 --> 00:49:05,484
Yes!
The veal stomach, I get that.

672
00:49:05,584 --> 00:49:06,784
Veal stomach?

673
00:49:14,184 --> 00:49:15,284
Oh!

674
00:49:15,384 --> 00:49:16,484
Okay.

675
00:49:24,484 --> 00:49:26,884
I'll be right back. Where...

676
00:49:28,284 --> 00:49:30,184
Hey, I got to... Hey!

677
00:49:30,484 --> 00:49:34,584
Don't mind me.
I just need to borrow this real quick.

678
00:49:34,784 --> 00:49:36,884
Let's see, over here...

679
00:49:36,984 --> 00:49:38,184
I'll be back.

680
00:49:39,384 --> 00:49:40,484
Thank you.

681
00:49:41,384 --> 00:49:42,784
Excuse me. I'm going to...

682
00:49:42,884 --> 00:49:45,484
Apparently, I need this. I'll be right...

683
00:49:45,684 --> 00:49:47,284
I'm going to pick that up.

684
00:49:47,384 --> 00:49:49,584
I got some of that spice.

685
00:49:50,484 --> 00:49:51,684
Okay.

686
00:49:51,984 --> 00:49:53,084
What are you doing? You're supposed

687
00:49:53,184 --> 00:49:54,484
to be preparing the Gusteau recipe.

688
00:49:54,584 --> 00:49:55,884
This is the recipe.

689
00:49:56,084 --> 00:49:58,084
The recipe doesn't call
for white truffle oil!

690
00:49:58,184 --> 00:50:00,684
What else have you...
You are improvising?

691
00:50:00,884 --> 00:50:03,284
This is no time to experiment.
The customer are waiting.

692
00:50:03,384 --> 00:50:05,584
You're right. I should listen to you!

693
00:50:06,584 --> 00:50:07,884
- Stop that!
- Stop what?

694
00:50:07,984 --> 00:50:10,584
Freaking me out!
Whatever you are doing, stop it.

695
00:50:10,684 --> 00:50:12,684
Where is the special order?
- Coming!

696
00:50:12,784 --> 00:50:15,084
- I thought we were together on this.
- We are together.

697
00:50:15,184 --> 00:50:17,884
- Then what are you doing?
- It's very hard to explain.

698
00:50:17,984 --> 00:50:20,284
- The special?
- Come get it!

699
00:50:22,384 --> 00:50:24,984
Whoa, whoa.
I forgot the anchovy licorice sauce.

700
00:50:30,384 --> 00:50:34,384
- Don't you dare.
- I'm not, I'm not. I'm...

701
00:50:37,584 --> 00:50:38,684
Sorry.

702
00:50:40,584 --> 00:50:43,184
Is Linguini's dish done yet?

703
00:50:43,284 --> 00:50:46,284
<i>Ja. It's as bad as we remember.
Just went out.</i>

704
00:50:46,384 --> 00:50:49,984
<i>- Did you taste it?
- Ja, of course, before he changed it.</i>

705
00:50:50,084 --> 00:50:52,884
Good. What? How could he change it?

706
00:50:52,984 --> 00:50:55,084
He changed it
as it was going out the door!

707
00:50:55,184 --> 00:50:56,184
Ow!

708
00:50:56,284 --> 00:50:57,284
They love it!

709
00:50:57,384 --> 00:51:00,084
Other diners are already
asking about it, about Linguini.

710
00:51:00,184 --> 00:51:01,984
I have seven more orders!

711
00:51:02,084 --> 00:51:04,684
That's wonderful.

712
00:51:09,384 --> 00:51:10,484
I'd like one of those.

713
00:51:13,084 --> 00:51:14,584
Special order!

714
00:51:18,484 --> 00:51:19,384
What is that?

715
00:51:19,484 --> 00:51:22,784
Special order! Special order!
Special order!

716
00:51:31,184 --> 00:51:32,584
To Linguini.

717
00:51:32,684 --> 00:51:35,284
<i>- Congratulations, Mr. Linguini.
- Cheers, ja?</i>

718
00:51:35,784 --> 00:51:37,784
Drink now, there's plenty.

719
00:51:42,084 --> 00:51:44,484
Take a break, Little Chef. Get some air.

720
00:51:45,584 --> 00:51:47,584
We really did it tonight.

721
00:51:52,384 --> 00:51:53,784
Dah!

722
00:51:57,484 --> 00:51:59,084
Got your toque!

723
00:52:00,084 --> 00:52:01,484
Oh, seriously now.

724
00:52:01,684 --> 00:52:06,284
I'd love to have a little talk with you,
Linguini, in my office.

725
00:52:06,384 --> 00:52:09,084
- Am I in trouble?
- Trouble? No.

726
00:52:09,184 --> 00:52:12,984
A little wine, a friendly chat.
Just us cooks.

727
00:52:14,584 --> 00:52:18,084
<i>The plongeur won't be coming to you
for advice anymore, eh, Colette?</i>

728
00:52:18,184 --> 00:52:20,884
He's gotten all he needs.

729
00:52:23,684 --> 00:52:26,584
Toasting your success, eh, Linguini?

730
00:52:28,084 --> 00:52:29,584
Good for you.

731
00:52:29,684 --> 00:52:33,684
I just took it to be polite.
I don't really drink, you know.

732
00:52:33,784 --> 00:52:37,884
Of course you don't.
I wouldn't either if I was drinking that.

733
00:52:37,984 --> 00:52:42,184
But you would have to be an idiot
of elephantine proportions

734
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:46,284
not to appreciate
this '61 Château Latour.

735
00:52:46,584 --> 00:52:50,584
<i>And you, Monsieur Linguini,
are no idiot.</i>

736
00:52:51,584 --> 00:52:54,384
Let us toast your non-idiocy.

737
00:53:18,284 --> 00:53:20,084
- Remy!
- Emile?

738
00:53:20,484 --> 00:53:22,384
I can't believe it! You're alive!

739
00:53:22,484 --> 00:53:23,984
- You made it!
- I thought I'd never see you guys again!

740
00:53:24,084 --> 00:53:26,084
We figured
you didn't survive the rapids.

741
00:53:26,184 --> 00:53:28,284
And what are you eating?

742
00:53:31,184 --> 00:53:32,984
I don't really know.

743
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:36,284
I think it was
some sort of wrapper once.

744
00:53:36,384 --> 00:53:41,084
What? No.
You're in Paris now, baby. My town.

745
00:53:41,184 --> 00:53:44,684
No brother of mine eats rejectamenta
in my town.

746
00:53:54,184 --> 00:53:57,584
Remy! You are stealing?
You told Linguini he could trust you.

747
00:53:57,684 --> 00:54:01,884
- And he can. It's for my brother.
- But the boy could lose his job.

748
00:54:01,984 --> 00:54:05,184
Which means I would, too.
It's under control, okay?

749
00:54:06,084 --> 00:54:10,084
- More wine?
- I shouldn't, but... Okay.

750
00:54:10,384 --> 00:54:13,784
So, where did you train, Linguini?

751
00:54:13,884 --> 00:54:16,184
Train? All right.

752
00:54:16,384 --> 00:54:20,884
Surely you don't expect me to believe
this is your first time cooking?

753
00:54:20,984 --> 00:54:22,284
- It's not.
- I knew it!

754
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:26,184
It's my... Second, third, fourth...
Fifth time.

755
00:54:26,284 --> 00:54:27,884
Monday was my first time.

756
00:54:27,984 --> 00:54:30,784
But I've taken out the garbage
lots of times before that...

757
00:54:30,884 --> 00:54:33,084
Yes, yes. Have some more wine.

758
00:54:33,284 --> 00:54:36,484
Tell me, Linguini, about your interests.

759
00:54:36,584 --> 00:54:38,584
Do you like animals?

760
00:54:38,684 --> 00:54:41,384
What?
Animals? What kind?

761
00:54:42,284 --> 00:54:46,084
The usual, dogs, cats, horses,
guinea pigs,

762
00:54:46,184 --> 00:54:47,284
rats.

763
00:54:48,784 --> 00:54:49,884
I brought you something to...

764
00:54:51,084 --> 00:54:52,084
No, no, no, no!

765
00:54:52,284 --> 00:54:53,984
Spit that out right now!

766
00:55:02,741 --> 00:55:06,141
- Don't just work it down!
- Too late.

767
00:55:06,341 --> 00:55:07,641
Here.

768
00:55:07,941 --> 00:55:12,341
Chew it slowly.
Only think about the taste.

769
00:55:14,841 --> 00:55:16,841
- See?
- Not really.

770
00:55:16,941 --> 00:55:20,241
Creamy, salty sweet,
an oaky nuttiness.

771
00:55:20,341 --> 00:55:23,341
- You detect that?
- Oh, I'm detecting nuttiness.

772
00:55:23,441 --> 00:55:26,541
Close your eyes. Now taste this.

773
00:55:27,041 --> 00:55:32,041
Whole different thing, right?
Sweet, crisp, slight tang on the finish.

774
00:55:32,241 --> 00:55:35,741
- Okay.
- Now, try them together.

775
00:55:36,741 --> 00:55:37,941
Okay.

776
00:55:38,341 --> 00:55:41,841
I think I'm getting
a little something there.

777
00:55:42,041 --> 00:55:44,041
- It might be the nuttiness.
- See?

778
00:55:44,141 --> 00:55:45,841
- Could be the tang.
- That's it.

779
00:55:45,941 --> 00:55:47,841
Now, imagine every great taste
in the world

780
00:55:47,941 --> 00:55:49,841
being combined
into infinite combinations.

781
00:55:49,941 --> 00:55:53,041
Tastes that no one has tried yet!
Discoveries to be made!

782
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:54,541
I think...

783
00:55:55,641 --> 00:55:58,241
- You lost me again.
- Yeah.

784
00:55:58,341 --> 00:55:59,741
But that was interesting.

785
00:55:59,841 --> 00:56:02,641
Most interesting garbage I ever...
Hey! What are we doing?

786
00:56:02,741 --> 00:56:04,141
Dad doesn't know you're alive yet!

787
00:56:04,241 --> 00:56:06,541
We've got to go to the colony!
Everyone will be thrilled!

788
00:56:06,641 --> 00:56:08,141
- Yeah! But...
- What?

789
00:56:08,341 --> 00:56:11,241
Thing is, I kind of have to...

790
00:56:11,741 --> 00:56:13,741
What do you "have to"
more than family?

791
00:56:13,841 --> 00:56:15,141
What's more important here?

792
00:56:15,241 --> 00:56:16,841
Well, I...

793
00:56:18,341 --> 00:56:20,341
It wouldn't hurt to visit.

794
00:56:20,641 --> 00:56:22,241
- Have you had a pet rat?
- No.

795
00:56:22,341 --> 00:56:24,241
- Did you work in a lab with rats?
- No.

796
00:56:24,341 --> 00:56:25,841
Perhaps you lived in squalor
at some point?

797
00:56:25,941 --> 00:56:27,541
Nopety nopety no.

798
00:56:27,641 --> 00:56:30,341
You know something about rats!
You know you do!

799
00:56:30,441 --> 00:56:33,741
You know who know do whacka-doo.
Ratta-tatta.

800
00:56:33,841 --> 00:56:36,241
- Hey! Why do they call it that?
- What?

801
00:56:36,341 --> 00:56:40,441
Ratatouille. It's like a stew, right?
Why do they call it that?

802
00:56:40,841 --> 00:56:42,141
If you're going to name a food,

803
00:56:42,241 --> 00:56:45,141
you should give it a name
that sounds delicious.

804
00:56:45,341 --> 00:56:50,541
Ratatouille doesn't sound delicious.
It sounds like "rat" and "patootie."

805
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:54,841
Rat patootie.
Which does not sound delicious.

806
00:56:56,841 --> 00:57:02,241
Regrettably we are all out of wine.

807
00:57:05,141 --> 00:57:07,041
My son has returned!

808
00:57:30,941 --> 00:57:36,541
And finding someone to replace you
for poison checker has been a disaster.

809
00:57:36,641 --> 00:57:40,541
Nothing's been poisoned, thank God,
but it hasn't been easy.

810
00:57:40,741 --> 00:57:45,141
- You didn't make it easy.
- I know. I am sorry, Dad.

811
00:57:45,241 --> 00:57:48,741
Well, the important thing
is that you're home.

812
00:57:48,841 --> 00:57:51,941
Yeah, well, about that...

813
00:57:52,041 --> 00:57:53,841
You look thin. Why is that?

814
00:57:53,941 --> 00:57:57,441
A shortage of food,
or a surplus of snobbery?

815
00:58:00,141 --> 00:58:03,141
It's tough out there in the big world
all alone, isn't it?

816
00:58:03,241 --> 00:58:06,341
Sure, but it's not like I'm a kid anymore.

817
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:09,041
- Hey. Hey, boy. What's up?
- I can take care of myself.

818
00:58:09,141 --> 00:58:13,041
I've found a nice spot not far away,
so I'll be able to visit often.

819
00:58:13,241 --> 00:58:16,641
Nothing like a cold splash of reality
to make you...

820
00:58:16,741 --> 00:58:19,541
- Visit?
- I will. I promise. Often.

821
00:58:19,641 --> 00:58:24,641
- You're not staying?
- No. It's not a big deal, Dad. I just...

822
00:58:24,741 --> 00:58:27,341
You didn't think
I was going to stay forever, did you?

823
00:58:27,441 --> 00:58:29,641
Eventually,
a bird's got to leave the nest.

824
00:58:29,741 --> 00:58:32,041
We're not birds. We're rats.

825
00:58:32,141 --> 00:58:35,041
We don't leave our nests.
We make them bigger.

826
00:58:35,141 --> 00:58:38,141
- Well, maybe I'm a different kind of rat.
- Maybe you're not a rat at all.

827
00:58:38,241 --> 00:58:39,341
Maybe that's a good thing.

828
00:58:39,441 --> 00:58:41,841
Hey! The band's
really on tonight, huh?

829
00:58:41,941 --> 00:58:44,141
Rats. All we do is take, Dad.

830
00:58:44,241 --> 00:58:46,741
I'm tired of taking.
I want to make things.

831
00:58:46,841 --> 00:58:48,941
I want to add something to this world.

832
00:58:49,041 --> 00:58:52,141
- You're talking like a human.
- Who are not as bad as you say.

833
00:58:52,241 --> 00:58:54,941
- Oh, yeah? What makes you so sure?
- Oh, man.

834
00:58:55,041 --> 00:58:58,741
I've been able to
observe them

835
00:58:58,841 --> 00:59:01,741
at a close-ish sort of range.

836
00:59:01,841 --> 00:59:04,141
- Yeah? How close?
- Close enough.

837
00:59:04,241 --> 00:59:07,841
And they're, you know,
not so bad as you say they are.

838
00:59:09,241 --> 00:59:12,341
Come with me.
I got something I want you to see.

839
00:59:13,941 --> 00:59:16,341
You know, I'm going to stay here.

840
00:59:17,141 --> 00:59:20,641
Make sure the floors and countertops
are clean before you lock up.

841
00:59:20,741 --> 00:59:23,841
Wait. You want me to stay and clean?

842
00:59:24,041 --> 00:59:25,941
Is that a problem?

843
00:59:26,141 --> 00:59:29,641
- No.
- Good boy. See you tomorrow.

844
00:59:37,241 --> 00:59:38,441
We're here.

845
00:59:48,641 --> 00:59:51,041
Take a good long look, Remy.

846
00:59:52,741 --> 00:59:53,841
Now, this is what happens

847
00:59:53,941 --> 00:59:57,541
when a rat gets
a little too comfortable around humans.

848
00:59:58,541 --> 01:00:01,941
The world we live in
belongs to the enemy.

849
01:00:03,241 --> 01:00:05,341
We must live carefully.

850
01:00:06,741 --> 01:00:09,541
We look out for our own kind, Remy.

851
01:00:10,041 --> 01:00:13,641
When all is said and done,
we're all we've got.

852
01:00:18,441 --> 01:00:20,841
- No.
- What?

853
01:00:21,641 --> 01:00:27,841
No. Dad, I don't believe it.
You're telling me that the future is...

854
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:31,041
Can only be more of this?

855
01:00:31,241 --> 01:00:36,441
This is the way things are.
You can't change nature.

856
01:00:36,641 --> 01:00:41,841
Change is nature, Dad.
The part that we can influence.

857
01:00:42,241 --> 01:00:45,441
And it starts when we decide.

858
01:00:46,041 --> 01:00:50,341
- Where you going?
- With luck, forward.

859
01:01:14,241 --> 01:01:15,541
Hey! Yeah.

860
01:02:13,641 --> 01:02:14,841
Stop it.

861
01:02:49,241 --> 01:02:50,441
Good morning.

862
01:02:52,641 --> 01:02:54,141
Good morning.

863
01:02:55,341 --> 01:02:59,641
So, the chef,
he invited you in for a drink?

864
01:02:59,741 --> 01:03:01,341
That's big.

865
01:03:01,441 --> 01:03:04,241
That's big. What did he say?

866
01:03:08,741 --> 01:03:09,741
What?

867
01:03:10,641 --> 01:03:12,341
What, you can't tell me?

868
01:03:13,041 --> 01:03:14,241
Oh!

869
01:03:14,341 --> 01:03:19,041
Forgive me for intruding on your deep,
personal relationship with the chef.

870
01:03:19,241 --> 01:03:20,541
Oh, I see how it is.

871
01:03:20,641 --> 01:03:23,241
You get me to teach you
a few kitchen tricks

872
01:03:23,441 --> 01:03:26,141
to dazzle the boss
and then you blow past me?

873
01:03:26,241 --> 01:03:27,741
Wake up. Wake up.

874
01:03:29,041 --> 01:03:31,841
I thought you were different.

875
01:03:33,241 --> 01:03:35,541
I thought you thought I was different.

876
01:03:36,041 --> 01:03:37,341
I thought...

877
01:03:41,041 --> 01:03:42,541
I didn't have to help you!

878
01:03:42,641 --> 01:03:46,041
If I looked out only for myself,
I would have let you drown!

879
01:03:46,141 --> 01:03:47,241
But...

880
01:03:48,141 --> 01:03:52,741
I wanted you to succeed. I liked you.

881
01:03:54,741 --> 01:03:56,041
My mistake.

882
01:03:56,741 --> 01:04:00,041
Colette. Wait, wait. Colette!

883
01:04:00,241 --> 01:04:03,141
It's over, Little Chef.
I can't do it anymore.

884
01:04:03,541 --> 01:04:07,241
Colette! Wait, wait!
Don't motorcycle away.

885
01:04:07,341 --> 01:04:10,641
Look, I'm no good with words.
I'm no good with food either.

886
01:04:10,741 --> 01:04:12,541
At least not without your help.

887
01:04:12,641 --> 01:04:16,041
I hate false modesty.
It's just another way to lie.

888
01:04:16,441 --> 01:04:20,241
- You have talent.
- No, but I don't! Really! It's not me.

889
01:04:20,741 --> 01:04:22,441
When I added that extra ingredient

890
01:04:22,541 --> 01:04:25,441
instead of following the recipe
like you said,

891
01:04:25,541 --> 01:04:27,741
that wasn't me either.

892
01:04:27,841 --> 01:04:30,741
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I wouldn't have done that.

893
01:04:30,841 --> 01:04:32,641
I would've followed the recipe.

894
01:04:32,741 --> 01:04:34,141
I would've followed your advice.

895
01:04:34,241 --> 01:04:36,041
I would've followed your advice
to the ends of the earth.

896
01:04:36,141 --> 01:04:40,341
- Because I love your advice.
- But...

897
01:04:40,441 --> 01:04:42,041
But I...

898
01:04:42,441 --> 01:04:43,741
Don't do it.

899
01:04:43,841 --> 01:04:47,141
I have a secret. It's sort of disturbing.

900
01:04:49,541 --> 01:04:52,441
- I have a...
- What? You...

901
01:04:52,541 --> 01:04:56,741
- I have a ra...
- You have a rash?

902
01:04:56,841 --> 01:05:02,141
No, no, no. I have this...
This tiny little...

903
01:05:02,341 --> 01:05:03,441
Little...

904
01:05:04,541 --> 01:05:06,741
A tiny chef
who tells me what to do.

905
01:05:06,841 --> 01:05:08,841
A tiny chef?

906
01:05:08,941 --> 01:05:11,441
Yes. Yes. He's...

907
01:05:13,241 --> 01:05:16,441
- He's up here.
- In your brain?

908
01:05:18,141 --> 01:05:21,841
Why is it so hard to talk to you?
Okay. Here we go.

909
01:05:23,041 --> 01:05:26,941
You inspire me. I'm going to risk it all.

910
01:05:27,141 --> 01:05:31,841
I'm going to risk looking like the
biggest idiot psycho you've ever seen.

911
01:05:32,041 --> 01:05:34,141
You want to know why
I'm such a fast learner?

912
01:05:34,341 --> 01:05:36,341
You want to know why
I'm such a great cook?

913
01:05:36,441 --> 01:05:39,141
Don't laugh! I'm going to show you!

914
01:05:42,741 --> 01:05:43,841
No! No!

915
01:06:29,041 --> 01:06:31,641
- What is it, Ambrister?
- Gusteau's.

916
01:06:31,741 --> 01:06:34,641
- Finally closing, is it?
- No.

917
01:06:34,741 --> 01:06:37,841
- More financial trouble?
- No, it's...

918
01:06:37,941 --> 01:06:40,441
Announced a new line
of microwave egg rolls?

919
01:06:40,541 --> 01:06:42,441
What? What? Spit it out.

920
01:06:42,541 --> 01:06:45,941
It's come back. It's popular.

921
01:06:50,241 --> 01:06:53,841
- I haven't reviewed Gusteau's in years.
- No, sir.

922
01:06:53,941 --> 01:06:55,041
My last review condemned it

923
01:06:55,141 --> 01:06:56,741
- to the tourist trade.
- Yes, sir.

924
01:06:56,841 --> 01:07:01,041
I said, "Gusteau has finally
found his rightful place in history

925
01:07:01,141 --> 01:07:04,841
"right alongside
another equally famous chef,

926
01:07:04,941 --> 01:07:06,741
<i>"Monsieur Boyardee."</i>

927
01:07:06,841 --> 01:07:07,841
Touché.

928
01:07:07,941 --> 01:07:11,341
That is where I left it.
That was my last word.

929
01:07:11,541 --> 01:07:14,441
- The last word.
- Yes.

930
01:07:14,541 --> 01:07:16,841
Then tell me, Ambrister,

931
01:07:17,841 --> 01:07:21,741
how could it be popular?

932
01:07:22,641 --> 01:07:27,241
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

933
01:07:27,341 --> 01:07:30,441
The DNA matches, the timing works,
everything checks out.

934
01:07:30,541 --> 01:07:31,841
He is Gusteau's son.

935
01:07:31,941 --> 01:07:35,841
This can't just happen!
The whole thing is a setup!

936
01:07:35,941 --> 01:07:37,241
The boy knows!

937
01:07:37,341 --> 01:07:40,341
Look at him out there,
pretending to be an idiot.

938
01:07:40,441 --> 01:07:44,841
He's toying with my mind
like a cat with a ball of... Something.

939
01:07:44,941 --> 01:07:47,441
- String?
- Yes! Playing dumb.

940
01:07:47,541 --> 01:07:49,541
- Taunting me with that rat.
- Rat?

941
01:07:49,641 --> 01:07:51,341
Yes. He's consorting with it.

942
01:07:51,441 --> 01:07:53,941
Deliberately trying to make me think
it's important.

943
01:07:54,141 --> 01:07:56,641
- The rat.
- Exactly!

944
01:07:57,941 --> 01:08:00,541
Is the rat important?

945
01:08:00,741 --> 01:08:03,941
Of course not!
He just wants me to think that it is.

946
01:08:04,041 --> 01:08:06,341
Oh, I see the theatricality of it.

947
01:08:06,441 --> 01:08:09,141
A rat appears on the boy's first night,
I order him to kill it.

948
01:08:09,241 --> 01:08:11,741
And now he wants me
to see it everywhere.

949
01:08:11,841 --> 01:08:13,641
Ooh!

950
01:08:13,741 --> 01:08:15,841
It's here! No, it isn't, it's here!

951
01:08:15,941 --> 01:08:19,141
Am I seeing things, am I crazy?
Is there a phantom rat or is there not?

952
01:08:19,341 --> 01:08:20,341
But, oh, no!

953
01:08:20,541 --> 01:08:24,741
I refuse to be sucked into
his little game of...

954
01:08:27,941 --> 01:08:33,441
Should I be concerned about this?
About you?

955
01:08:40,541 --> 01:08:41,541
Huh?

956
01:08:53,341 --> 01:08:55,241
I can't fire him. He's getting attention.

957
01:08:55,341 --> 01:08:57,741
If I fire him now,
everyone will wonder why.

958
01:08:57,841 --> 01:09:00,241
And the last thing I want
is people looking into this.

959
01:09:00,341 --> 01:09:02,041
What are you so worried about?

960
01:09:02,141 --> 01:09:03,341
Isn't it good to have the press?

961
01:09:03,441 --> 01:09:06,041
Isn't it good to have Gusteau's name
getting headlines?

962
01:09:06,141 --> 01:09:08,541
Not if they're over his face!

963
01:09:09,141 --> 01:09:12,741
Gusteau's already has a face,
and it's fat and lovable and familiar.

964
01:09:12,841 --> 01:09:17,841
And it sells burritos!
Millions and millions of burritos!

965
01:09:17,941 --> 01:09:19,941
The deadline passes in three days.

966
01:09:20,041 --> 01:09:22,941
Then you can fire him
whenever he ceases to be valuable

967
01:09:23,041 --> 01:09:25,141
and no one will ever know.

968
01:09:25,741 --> 01:09:28,141
I was worried
about the hair sample you gave me.

969
01:09:28,241 --> 01:09:30,741
- I had to send them back to the lab.
- Why?

970
01:09:30,841 --> 01:09:35,341
Because the first time it came back
identified as rodent hair.

971
01:09:41,041 --> 01:09:42,241
- No, no, no.
- LINGUINl: What?

972
01:09:42,341 --> 01:09:44,641
Try this. It's better.

973
01:09:58,741 --> 01:10:00,841
Well, because you...

974
01:10:01,941 --> 01:10:02,941
Whoa!

975
01:10:25,141 --> 01:10:26,141
Rat!

976
01:10:32,641 --> 01:10:34,841
Disgusting little creatures.

977
01:10:44,741 --> 01:10:47,741
<i>I was reminded
how fragile it all was.</i>

978
01:10:48,641 --> 01:10:50,741
<i>How the world really saw me.</i>

979
01:10:52,241 --> 01:10:55,541
<i>And it just kept getting better.</i>

980
01:10:56,041 --> 01:10:56,241
Remy!

981
01:10:56,241 --> 01:10:57,141
Remy!

982
01:10:57,241 --> 01:10:58,541
Psst! Psst!

983
01:11:00,741 --> 01:11:03,141
Hey, hey, hey, little brother!

984
01:11:03,341 --> 01:11:06,841
We were afraid you weren't going to,
you know, show up.

985
01:11:07,041 --> 01:11:10,841
- Hey, Remy! How you doing?
- You told them?

986
01:11:10,941 --> 01:11:13,841
Emile,
that's exactly what I said not to do!

987
01:11:13,941 --> 01:11:15,741
But you know these guys.
They're my friends.

988
01:11:15,841 --> 01:11:16,941
I didn't think you meant them.

989
01:11:17,041 --> 01:11:19,141
Look, I'm sorry.

990
01:11:19,241 --> 01:11:21,641
Don't tell me you're sorry,
tell them you're sorry.

991
01:11:21,741 --> 01:11:26,341
- Is there a problem over here?
- No, there is not.

992
01:11:26,441 --> 01:11:27,741
Wait here.

993
01:11:33,641 --> 01:11:34,841
It's locked?

994
01:11:36,341 --> 01:11:37,341
Hmm...

995
01:11:41,941 --> 01:11:43,741
Remy, what are you doing in here?

996
01:11:43,841 --> 01:11:46,641
Okay. Emile shows up with...

997
01:11:46,741 --> 01:11:50,641
Okay, I said not to. I told him...
He goes and blabs to...

998
01:11:50,841 --> 01:11:52,941
Yeah, it's a disaster.

999
01:11:53,041 --> 01:11:56,641
Anyway, they're hungry, the food safe
is locked and I need the key.

1000
01:11:56,741 --> 01:12:00,641
- They want you to steal food?
- Yes. No! It's...

1001
01:12:00,641 --> 01:12:00,941
- They want you to steal food?
- Yes. No! It's...

1002
01:12:01,041 --> 01:12:04,841
It's complicated. It's family.
They don't have your ideals.

1003
01:12:04,941 --> 01:12:07,641
Ideals?
If Chef Fancy Pants had any ideals,

1004
01:12:07,741 --> 01:12:09,741
you think I'd be hawking barbecue
over here?

1005
01:12:09,841 --> 01:12:10,941
Or microwave burritos?

1006
01:12:11,041 --> 01:12:13,141
Or, Tooth, I say,
Tooth Pick'n Chicken?

1007
01:12:13,241 --> 01:12:14,941
About as French as a corn dog!

1008
01:12:15,241 --> 01:12:16,241
Coming soon!

1009
01:12:16,341 --> 01:12:18,241
We're inventing new ways
to sell out over here.

1010
01:12:18,341 --> 01:12:19,941
Will ye be wanting some haggis bites?

1011
01:12:20,041 --> 01:12:21,741
I cannot control
how they use my image, Remy.

1012
01:12:21,841 --> 01:12:24,241
- I am dead!
- Can you guys shut up?

1013
01:12:25,241 --> 01:12:29,341
I've got to think! Word's getting out.
If I can't keep them quiet,

1014
01:12:29,441 --> 01:12:32,741
the entire clan's gonna be after me
with their mouths open and...

1015
01:12:32,841 --> 01:12:33,841
Here it is.

1016
01:12:34,241 --> 01:12:36,541
Hey. Your will!

1017
01:12:36,641 --> 01:12:41,341
- Oh, this is interesting. Mind if I...
- Not at all.

1018
01:12:44,041 --> 01:12:45,341
Linguini?

1019
01:12:46,241 --> 01:12:48,941
Why would Linguini be filed
with your will?

1020
01:12:49,041 --> 01:12:50,841
This used to be my office.

1021
01:13:14,141 --> 01:13:15,641
He's your son?

1022
01:13:15,741 --> 01:13:18,541
- I have a son?
- How could you not know this?

1023
01:13:18,741 --> 01:13:22,641
I am a figment of your imagination.
You did not know, how could I?

1024
01:13:22,841 --> 01:13:23,641
Well, your son is the rightful owner
of this restaurant!

1025
01:13:23,641 --> 01:13:26,541
Well, your son is the rightful owner
of this restaurant!

1026
01:13:27,941 --> 01:13:29,541
No! No! The rat!

1027
01:13:35,641 --> 01:13:38,441
- Sorry, chef.
- The rat! It's stolen my documents!

1028
01:13:38,541 --> 01:13:40,941
- It's getting away!
Hey, Mr. Chef!

1029
01:15:15,241 --> 01:15:16,841
You!

1030
01:15:16,941 --> 01:15:21,641
- Get out of my office.
- He's not in your office. You are in his.

1031
01:15:24,841 --> 01:15:26,841
Bottoms up, Linguini!

1032
01:15:29,441 --> 01:15:30,641
<i>Cheers, ja.</i>

1033
01:16:37,941 --> 01:16:40,241
Chef! Chef!
Chef Linguini!

1034
01:16:41,441 --> 01:16:44,441
Your rise has been meteoric,
yet you have no formal training.

1035
01:16:44,641 --> 01:16:46,041
What is the secret to your genius?

1036
01:16:46,141 --> 01:16:49,741
LINGUINl: Secret? You want the truth?

1037
01:16:50,441 --> 01:16:55,841
I am Gusteau's son.
It's in my blood I guess.

1038
01:16:55,941 --> 01:16:58,341
But you weren't
aware of that fact until very recently.

1039
01:16:58,441 --> 01:16:59,341
No.

1040
01:16:59,441 --> 01:17:02,241
And it resulted in
your taking ownership of this restaurant.

1041
01:17:02,341 --> 01:17:03,841
How did you find out?

1042
01:17:03,941 --> 01:17:07,241
Well, some part of me just knew.

1043
01:17:07,741 --> 01:17:09,041
The Gusteau part?

1044
01:17:10,541 --> 01:17:15,141
- Where do you get your inspiration?
- Inspiration has many names.

1045
01:17:15,341 --> 01:17:17,941
- Mine is named Colette.
- What?

1046
01:17:19,541 --> 01:17:21,641
Something's stuck in my teeth.

1047
01:17:25,141 --> 01:17:26,441
Health Inspector.

1048
01:17:26,541 --> 01:17:29,141
I wish to report a rat infestation.

1049
01:17:29,341 --> 01:17:30,441
It's taken over my...

1050
01:17:30,541 --> 01:17:32,941
Gusteau's restaurant.

1051
01:17:33,041 --> 01:17:34,141
<i>Gusteau's, eh?</i>

1052
01:17:34,241 --> 01:17:38,441
I can drop by. Let's see.
First opening is three months.

1053
01:17:38,541 --> 01:17:40,641
<i>It must happen now!
It's a gourmet restaurant!</i>

1054
01:17:40,741 --> 01:17:43,541
<i>Monsieur, I have the information.
If someone cancels, I'll slot you in.</i>

1055
01:17:43,641 --> 01:17:45,741
But the rat!
You must...

1056
01:17:47,441 --> 01:17:49,341
It stole my documents.

1057
01:17:50,541 --> 01:17:52,141
It's past opening time.

1058
01:17:52,241 --> 01:17:54,641
He should have
finished an hour ago.

1059
01:17:56,541 --> 01:17:58,841
<i>Bonjour, ma chérie.
Join us.</i>

1060
01:17:58,941 --> 01:18:01,041
We were just talking
about my inspiration.

1061
01:18:01,241 --> 01:18:03,541
Yes, he calls it his tiny chef.

1062
01:18:04,841 --> 01:18:07,241
Not that, dearest. I meant you.

1063
01:18:09,841 --> 01:18:11,541
- It's him.
- Ego?

1064
01:18:11,641 --> 01:18:12,641
Anton Ego!

1065
01:18:12,841 --> 01:18:14,141
Is that Ego?

1066
01:18:14,841 --> 01:18:16,341
I can't believe it.

1067
01:18:16,441 --> 01:18:19,741
<i>- You are Monsieur Linguini?
- Hello.</i>

1068
01:18:19,841 --> 01:18:24,341
Pardon me for interrupting
your premature celebration,

1069
01:18:24,441 --> 01:18:28,141
but I thought it only fair
to give you a sporting chance

1070
01:18:28,241 --> 01:18:30,441
as you are new to this game.

1071
01:18:31,741 --> 01:18:32,941
- Game?
- Yes.

1072
01:18:33,041 --> 01:18:36,141
And you've been playing
without an opponent.

1073
01:18:36,241 --> 01:18:41,341
Which is, as you may have guessed,
against the rules.

1074
01:18:41,541 --> 01:18:43,641
You're Anton Ego.

1075
01:18:45,241 --> 01:18:48,141
You're slow
for someone in the fast lane.

1076
01:18:49,741 --> 01:18:52,741
And you're thin
for someone who likes food.

1077
01:18:56,341 --> 01:19:00,341
I don't like food. I love it.

1078
01:19:00,741 --> 01:19:05,041
If I don't love it, I don't swallow.

1079
01:19:06,341 --> 01:19:10,341
I will return tomorrow night
with high expectations.

1080
01:19:10,741 --> 01:19:13,541
Pray you don't disappoint me.

1081
01:19:20,841 --> 01:19:24,341
Listen, we hate to be rude,
but we're French, and it's dinnertime.

1082
01:19:24,441 --> 01:19:27,541
She meant to say,
"It's dinnertime and we're French."

1083
01:19:29,441 --> 01:19:30,941
Don't give me that look.

1084
01:19:31,141 --> 01:19:33,241
You were distracting me
in front of the press.

1085
01:19:33,341 --> 01:19:37,841
How am I supposed to concentrate with
you yanking on my hair all the time?

1086
01:19:37,941 --> 01:19:39,141
And that's another thing.

1087
01:19:39,241 --> 01:19:42,141
Your opinion isn't the only one
that matters here.

1088
01:19:42,241 --> 01:19:44,841
Colette knows how to cook, too,
you know.

1089
01:19:44,941 --> 01:19:46,441
All right, that's it!

1090
01:19:50,541 --> 01:19:52,341
You take a break, Little Chef.

1091
01:19:52,441 --> 01:19:53,641
I'm not your puppet,

1092
01:19:53,741 --> 01:19:56,841
and you're not
my puppet-controlling guy!

1093
01:19:56,941 --> 01:19:58,741
The rat is the cook.

1094
01:19:58,841 --> 01:19:59,541
You cool off and get your mind right,
Little Chef.

1095
01:19:59,541 --> 01:20:01,741
You cool off and get your mind right,
Little Chef.

1096
01:20:01,841 --> 01:20:04,841
Ego is coming, and I need to focus!

1097
01:20:07,941 --> 01:20:09,341
You stupid...

1098
01:20:11,841 --> 01:20:15,041
Wow. I have never seen that before.

1099
01:20:15,141 --> 01:20:18,441
Yeah, it's like you're his fluffy bunny
or something.

1100
01:20:19,941 --> 01:20:21,441
I'm sorry, Remy.

1101
01:20:21,541 --> 01:20:22,541
I know there are too many guys.

1102
01:20:22,641 --> 01:20:23,641
- I tried to limit...
- You know what?

1103
01:20:23,741 --> 01:20:25,541
It's okay. I've been selfish.

1104
01:20:25,641 --> 01:20:27,741
- You guys hungry?
- Are you kidding?

1105
01:20:27,841 --> 01:20:30,741
All right. Dinner's on me.
We'll go after closing time.

1106
01:20:30,941 --> 01:20:32,041
- In fact...
- Yeah.

1107
01:20:32,141 --> 01:20:34,541
...tell Dad to bring the whole clan.

1108
01:20:36,141 --> 01:20:37,641
Little Chef?

1109
01:20:47,141 --> 01:20:51,941
This is great, Son.
An inside job. I see the appeal.

1110
01:21:11,541 --> 01:21:12,641
Oof!

1111
01:21:28,841 --> 01:21:30,241
Little Chef?

1112
01:21:31,041 --> 01:21:32,241
Little Chef?

1113
01:21:33,041 --> 01:21:34,641
Hey, Little Chef.

1114
01:21:34,941 --> 01:21:38,041
I thought you went back
to the apartment.

1115
01:21:38,241 --> 01:21:42,341
Then when you weren't there,
I don't know...

1116
01:21:42,741 --> 01:21:46,741
It didn't seem right to leave things
the way that we did, so...

1117
01:21:47,741 --> 01:21:49,641
Look, I don't want to fight.

1118
01:21:49,841 --> 01:21:52,541
I've been under a lot of, you know,
pressure.

1119
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:56,041
A lot has changed
in not very much time, you know?

1120
01:21:56,141 --> 01:21:57,441
I'm suddenly a Gusteau.

1121
01:21:57,541 --> 01:21:59,441
And I got to be a Gusteau or, you know,

1122
01:22:00,641 --> 01:22:02,241
people will be disappointed.

1123
01:22:02,641 --> 01:22:04,241
It's weird.

1124
01:22:04,341 --> 01:22:07,241
You know, I've never
disappointed anyone before,

1125
01:22:07,341 --> 01:22:10,141
because nobody's
ever expected anything of me.

1126
01:22:10,241 --> 01:22:13,041
And the only reason
anyone expects anything from me now

1127
01:22:13,141 --> 01:22:15,341
is because of you.

1128
01:22:16,941 --> 01:22:18,641
I haven't been fair to you.

1129
01:22:18,741 --> 01:22:22,241
You've never failed me,
and I should never forget that.

1130
01:22:22,441 --> 01:22:24,141
You've been a good friend.

1131
01:22:24,341 --> 01:22:27,341
The most honorable friend
a guy could ever ask...

1132
01:22:29,341 --> 01:22:30,641
What is this?

1133
01:22:31,041 --> 01:22:32,741
What's going on?

1134
01:22:35,241 --> 01:22:36,241
What...

1135
01:22:36,341 --> 01:22:37,241
Hey...

1136
01:22:37,841 --> 01:22:39,141
You're...

1137
01:22:39,241 --> 01:22:42,341
You're stealing food? How could you?

1138
01:22:42,441 --> 01:22:45,541
I thought you were my friend!
I trusted you!

1139
01:22:45,841 --> 01:22:48,041
Get out! You and all your rat buddies!

1140
01:22:48,141 --> 01:22:49,541
And don't come back

1141
01:22:49,641 --> 01:22:53,041
or I'll treat you the way restaurants
are supposed to treat pests!

1142
01:23:01,241 --> 01:23:04,441
You're right, Dad. Who am I kidding?

1143
01:23:05,041 --> 01:23:08,441
We are what we are, and we're rats.

1144
01:23:09,841 --> 01:23:13,641
Well, he'll leave soon,
and now you know how to get in.

1145
01:23:14,141 --> 01:23:15,541
Steal all you want.

1146
01:23:15,641 --> 01:23:18,541
- You're not coming?
- I've lost my appetite.

1147
01:23:33,141 --> 01:23:35,641
Do you know
what you would like this evening, sir?

1148
01:23:35,741 --> 01:23:40,541
Yes,
I'd like your heart roasted on a spit.

1149
01:23:45,941 --> 01:23:47,441
Come in!

1150
01:23:47,641 --> 01:23:50,841
Today's the big day.
You should say something to them.

1151
01:23:51,041 --> 01:23:54,841
- Like what?
- You are the boss. Inspire them.

1152
01:23:58,241 --> 01:23:59,641
Attention.

1153
01:23:59,841 --> 01:24:02,541
Attention, everyone.

1154
01:24:02,741 --> 01:24:04,941
Tonight is a big night.

1155
01:24:05,141 --> 01:24:09,041
Appetite is coming,
and he's going to have a big ego.

1156
01:24:09,241 --> 01:24:13,241
I mean, Ego. He's coming. The critic.

1157
01:24:13,941 --> 01:24:16,841
And he's going to order something.

1158
01:24:17,441 --> 01:24:19,541
Something from our menu.

1159
01:24:20,241 --> 01:24:24,341
And we'll have to cook it,
unless he orders something cold.

1160
01:24:24,441 --> 01:24:26,241
Just can't leave it alone,
can you?

1161
01:24:26,441 --> 01:24:30,041
You really shouldn't be here
during restaurant hours. It's not safe.

1162
01:24:30,141 --> 01:24:31,341
I'm hungry!

1163
01:24:31,441 --> 01:24:34,141
And I don't need the inside food
to be happy.

1164
01:24:34,241 --> 01:24:37,241
The key, my friend, is to not be picky.

1165
01:24:37,641 --> 01:24:39,741
- Observe.
- No, wait!

1166
01:24:41,341 --> 01:24:45,241
- Oh, no! No, no! What do we do?
- I'll go get Dad.

1167
01:24:47,741 --> 01:24:54,041
You might think you are a chef
but you are still only a rat.

1168
01:24:54,441 --> 01:24:57,641
Sure he took away a star
last time he reviewed this place.

1169
01:24:57,841 --> 01:25:00,241
Sure it probably killed... Dad.

1170
01:25:00,541 --> 01:25:04,241
- This is very bad juju right here.
- But I'll tell you one thing...

1171
01:25:04,341 --> 01:25:07,141
- Ego is here.
- Ego? He is here?

1172
01:25:09,141 --> 01:25:13,241
Anton Ego is just another customer.
Let's cook!

1173
01:25:13,341 --> 01:25:15,241
Yeah! Let's...

1174
01:25:15,641 --> 01:25:16,841
Okay.

1175
01:25:18,341 --> 01:25:21,241
So I have in mind
a simple arrangement.

1176
01:25:21,441 --> 01:25:25,441
You will create for me a new line
of Chef Skinner frozen foods.

1177
01:25:25,541 --> 01:25:29,341
And I, in return, will not kill you.

1178
01:25:33,141 --> 01:25:36,241
<i>Au revoir, rat!</i>

1179
01:25:43,541 --> 01:25:46,141
Do you know
what you would like this evening, sir?

1180
01:25:46,241 --> 01:25:47,841
Yes, I think I do.

1181
01:25:48,341 --> 01:25:52,441
After reading a lot of overheated
puffery about your new cook,

1182
01:25:52,541 --> 01:25:54,641
you know what I'm craving?

1183
01:25:55,641 --> 01:25:58,941
A little perspective.

1184
01:25:59,141 --> 01:26:04,241
That's it. I'd like some fresh, clear,
well seasoned perspective.

1185
01:26:04,341 --> 01:26:07,141
Can you suggest
a good wine to go with that?

1186
01:26:07,241 --> 01:26:12,141
- With what, sir?
- Perspective. Fresh out, I take it?

1187
01:26:12,241 --> 01:26:13,441
I am...

1188
01:26:14,541 --> 01:26:17,341
Very well.
Since you're all out of perspective

1189
01:26:17,441 --> 01:26:20,741
and no one else
seems to have it in this bloody town,

1190
01:26:20,841 --> 01:26:22,441
I'll make you a deal.

1191
01:26:22,541 --> 01:26:26,641
You provide the food,
I'll provide the perspective.

1192
01:26:26,741 --> 01:26:30,741
Which would go nicely
with a bottle of Cheval Blanc 1947.

1193
01:26:30,841 --> 01:26:32,641
I'm afraid I...

1194
01:26:34,341 --> 01:26:36,741
Your dinner selection?

1195
01:26:37,441 --> 01:26:42,241
Tell your Chef Linguini that I want
whatever he dares to serve me.

1196
01:26:42,341 --> 01:26:45,741
Tell him to hit me with his best shot.

1197
01:26:49,541 --> 01:26:52,441
I will have whatever he is having.

1198
01:26:59,241 --> 01:27:02,741
- So, we have given up.
- Why do you say that?

1199
01:27:02,941 --> 01:27:05,941
We are in a cage inside the car trunk

1200
01:27:06,141 --> 01:27:09,041
awaiting a future
in frozen food products.

1201
01:27:09,241 --> 01:27:13,041
No, I'm the one in a cage. I've given up.

1202
01:27:13,441 --> 01:27:15,741
You are free.

1203
01:27:15,941 --> 01:27:19,341
I am only as free
as you imagine me to be.

1204
01:27:19,441 --> 01:27:20,741
As you are.

1205
01:27:20,841 --> 01:27:25,441
Oh, please. I'm sick of pretending.
I pretend to be a rat for my father.

1206
01:27:25,541 --> 01:27:27,941
I pretend to be a human
through Linguini.

1207
01:27:28,041 --> 01:27:30,741
I pretend you exist
so I have someone to talk to!

1208
01:27:30,841 --> 01:27:32,841
You only tell me stuff I already know!

1209
01:27:32,941 --> 01:27:35,941
I know who I am!
Why do I need you to tell me?

1210
01:27:36,041 --> 01:27:38,041
Why do I need to pretend?

1211
01:27:40,141 --> 01:27:41,741
But you don't, Remy.

1212
01:27:42,541 --> 01:27:44,141
You never did.

1213
01:27:53,141 --> 01:27:55,141
No. My other left!

1214
01:27:55,341 --> 01:27:57,141
Dad? Dad, I'm in here!

1215
01:27:57,341 --> 01:27:59,641
I'm inside the trunk! What the...

1216
01:27:59,941 --> 01:28:00,941
Dad!

1217
01:28:01,541 --> 01:28:04,141
- Hey, little brother!
- Emile!

1218
01:28:07,641 --> 01:28:09,741
I love you guys!

1219
01:28:11,741 --> 01:28:12,841
Where are you going?

1220
01:28:12,941 --> 01:28:15,441
Back to the restaurant.
They'll fail without me.

1221
01:28:15,541 --> 01:28:19,141
- Why do you care?
- Because I'm a cook!

1222
01:28:26,841 --> 01:28:28,641
It's your recipe.

1223
01:28:28,741 --> 01:28:30,841
How can you not know
your own recipe?

1224
01:28:30,941 --> 01:28:33,841
I didn't write it down. It just came to me.

1225
01:28:33,941 --> 01:28:37,041
<i>Then make it come to you again, ja?
Because we can't serve this!</i>

1226
01:28:37,141 --> 01:28:38,141
Where's my order?

1227
01:28:38,241 --> 01:28:40,641
Can't we serve something else?
Something I didn't invent?

1228
01:28:40,741 --> 01:28:41,741
This is what they're ordering.

1229
01:28:41,841 --> 01:28:44,241
Make them order something else.
Tell them we're all out.

1230
01:28:44,341 --> 01:28:46,041
We cannot be all out. We just opened.

1231
01:28:46,141 --> 01:28:49,141
I have another idea.
What if we serve them what they order!

1232
01:28:49,241 --> 01:28:51,341
We will make it.
Just tell us what you did.

1233
01:28:51,441 --> 01:28:52,841
I don't know what I did.

1234
01:28:52,941 --> 01:28:54,641
We need to tell
the customers something.

1235
01:28:54,741 --> 01:28:56,641
Then tell them... Tell them...

1236
01:29:00,741 --> 01:29:01,941
Huh?

1237
01:29:02,741 --> 01:29:05,141
- Don't do it.
- Remy. Remy.

1238
01:29:05,241 --> 01:29:07,241
Don't! Stop!
They'll see you. Stop.

1239
01:29:07,341 --> 01:29:11,341
We're not talking about me.
We're talking about what to do right...

1240
01:29:11,741 --> 01:29:12,741
Rats!

1241
01:29:14,541 --> 01:29:16,041
- Remy!
- Get my knife.

1242
01:29:16,541 --> 01:29:18,141
Don't touch him!

1243
01:29:20,441 --> 01:29:22,841
Thanks for coming back, Little Chef.

1244
01:29:24,141 --> 01:29:26,441
I know this sounds insane, but...

1245
01:29:26,541 --> 01:29:29,141
Well,
the truth sounds insane sometimes.

1246
01:29:29,241 --> 01:29:31,041
But that doesn't mean it's not

1247
01:29:31,141 --> 01:29:33,341
the truth.

1248
01:29:34,041 --> 01:29:38,241
And the truth is, I have no talent at all.

1249
01:29:39,041 --> 01:29:42,941
But this rat,
he's the one behind these recipes.

1250
01:29:43,041 --> 01:29:48,141
He's the cook. The real cook.
He's been hiding under my toque.

1251
01:29:48,441 --> 01:29:50,441
He's been controlling my actions.

1252
01:29:52,441 --> 01:29:56,041
He's the reason I can cook the food
that's exciting everyone.

1253
01:29:56,241 --> 01:29:59,341
The reason Ego is outside that door.

1254
01:29:59,641 --> 01:30:02,341
You've been giving me credit
for his gift.

1255
01:30:02,641 --> 01:30:04,241
I know it's a hard thing to believe.

1256
01:30:04,341 --> 01:30:07,341
But, hey, you believed I could cook,
right?

1257
01:30:09,041 --> 01:30:13,241
Look, this works.
It's crazy, but it works.

1258
01:30:13,741 --> 01:30:16,141
We can be
the greatest restaurant in Paris,

1259
01:30:16,241 --> 01:30:21,741
and this rat, this brilliant Little Chef,
can lead us there.

1260
01:30:22,441 --> 01:30:24,841
What do you say? You with me?

1261
01:32:12,841 --> 01:32:13,841
Dad.

1262
01:32:17,941 --> 01:32:20,841
Dad, I don't know what to say.

1263
01:32:21,041 --> 01:32:25,141
I was wrong about your friend
and about you.

1264
01:32:25,541 --> 01:32:29,341
I don't want you to think
I'm choosing this over family.

1265
01:32:29,541 --> 01:32:32,341
I can't choose
between two halves of myself.

1266
01:32:32,441 --> 01:32:36,241
I'm not talking about cooking.
I'm talking about guts.

1267
01:32:36,941 --> 01:32:39,341
This really means that much to you?

1268
01:32:47,441 --> 01:32:50,341
We're not cooks, but we are family.

1269
01:32:50,541 --> 01:32:53,541
You tell us what to do,
and we'll get it done.

1270
01:33:01,541 --> 01:33:05,141
- Stop that health inspector!
- Delta Team, go, go, go, go!

1271
01:33:05,341 --> 01:33:07,541
The rest of you stay and help Remy.

1272
01:33:30,641 --> 01:33:32,441
Team three will be handling fish.
Team four, roasted items.

1273
01:33:32,441 --> 01:33:34,141
Team three will be handling fish.
Team four, roasted items.

1274
01:33:34,341 --> 01:33:39,741
Team five, grill. Team six, sauces.
Get to your stations. Let's go, go, go!

1275
01:33:40,041 --> 01:33:42,541
Those handling food
will walk on two legs.

1276
01:33:52,241 --> 01:33:54,241
We need someone to wait tables.

1277
01:34:09,541 --> 01:34:12,541
I'm sorry for any delay,
but we're a little short tonight.

1278
01:34:12,641 --> 01:34:14,941
Please, take all of the time you need.

1279
01:34:18,041 --> 01:34:20,641
He came in late one more time
and all of a sudden he...

1280
01:34:25,041 --> 01:34:27,341
Make sure that steak
is nice and tenderized.

1281
01:34:27,441 --> 01:34:29,741
Work it. Yeah. Stick and move.
Stick and move.

1282
01:34:29,841 --> 01:34:33,341
Easy with that sole meunière.
Less salt. More butter.

1283
01:34:33,641 --> 01:34:35,541
Only use the mimolette cheese.

1284
01:34:35,641 --> 01:34:39,241
Whoa! Compose the salad
like you were painting a picture.

1285
01:34:39,441 --> 01:34:42,141
Not too much vinaigrette
on that salade composée.

1286
01:34:42,241 --> 01:34:45,341
Don't let that beurre blanc separate.
Keep whisking.

1287
01:34:45,441 --> 01:34:49,641
Gently poach the scallops.
Taste check. Spoons down.

1288
01:34:49,841 --> 01:34:52,141
Good. Too much salt. Good.

1289
01:34:52,341 --> 01:34:55,241
Don't boil the consommé,
it'll toughen the pheasant. Emile!

1290
01:34:55,341 --> 01:34:56,441
Sorry.

1291
01:35:00,141 --> 01:35:02,241
Colette, wait! Colette.

1292
01:35:02,741 --> 01:35:06,741
- You came back. Colette...
- Don't say a word.

1293
01:35:06,841 --> 01:35:08,341
If I think about it,
I might change my mind.

1294
01:35:08,541 --> 01:35:10,941
Just tell me what the rat wants to cook.

1295
01:35:14,041 --> 01:35:16,541
Ratatouille? It's a peasant dish.

1296
01:35:16,741 --> 01:35:19,641
Are you sure
you want to serve this to Ego?

1297
01:35:38,141 --> 01:35:40,041
What? I am making ratatouille.

1298
01:35:41,241 --> 01:35:43,641
Well, how would you prepare it?

1299
01:36:15,741 --> 01:36:18,841
Ratatouille? They must be joking.

1300
01:37:04,941 --> 01:37:06,241
Mmm.

1301
01:37:09,741 --> 01:37:11,541
No, it can't be.

1302
01:37:12,141 --> 01:37:15,741
Who cooked the ratatouille?
I demand to know!

1303
01:37:22,741 --> 01:37:24,441
I can't remember the last time

1304
01:37:24,541 --> 01:37:27,841
I asked a waiter
to give my compliments to the chef.

1305
01:37:28,741 --> 01:37:31,541
And now I find myself
in the extraordinary position

1306
01:37:31,641 --> 01:37:33,741
of having my waiter be the chef.

1307
01:37:33,941 --> 01:37:36,941
Thanks, but I'm just your waiter tonight.

1308
01:37:37,941 --> 01:37:40,441
Then who do I thank for the meal?

1309
01:37:41,341 --> 01:37:43,041
Excuse me a minute.

1310
01:37:54,041 --> 01:37:55,041
You must be the chef...

1311
01:37:55,141 --> 01:37:57,241
If you wish to meet the chef,
you will have to wait

1312
01:37:57,341 --> 01:37:59,441
until all the other customer have gone.

1313
01:38:01,441 --> 01:38:02,641
So be it.

1314
01:38:24,341 --> 01:38:26,841
<i>At first, Ego thinks it's a joke.</i>

1315
01:38:27,041 --> 01:38:33,041
<i>But as Linguini explains,
Ego's smile disappears.</i>

1316
01:38:38,641 --> 01:38:42,641
<i>He doesn't react
beyond asking an 
occasional question.</i>

1317
01:38:43,241 --> 01:38:47,541
<i>And when the story is done,
Ego stands, thanks us for the meal...</i>

1318
01:38:47,641 --> 01:38:49,341
Thank you for the meal.

1319
01:38:49,441 --> 01:38:52,341
<i>... and leaves without another word.</i>

1320
01:38:54,641 --> 01:38:58,541
<i>The following day his review appears.</i>

1321
01:39:01,041 --> 01:39:05,141
<i>In many ways,
the work of a critic is easy.</i>

1322
01:39:05,341 --> 01:39:09,641
<i>We risk very little,
yet enjoy a position over those</i>

1323
01:39:09,741 --> 01:39:13,741
<i>who offer up their work
and their selves to our judgment.</i>

1324
01:39:14,041 --> 01:39:19,341
<i>We thrive on negative criticism,
which is fun to write and to read.</i>

1325
01:39:19,941 --> 01:39:26,441
<i>But the bitter truth we critics must face
is that in the grand scheme of things,</i>

1326
01:39:26,541 --> 01:39:30,541
<i>the average piece of junk
is probably more meaningful</i>

1327
01:39:30,641 --> 01:39:33,941
<i>than our criticism designating it so.</i>

1328
01:39:34,341 --> 01:39:38,441
<i>But there are times
when a critic truly risks something</i>

1329
01:39:38,541 --> 01:39:42,841
<i>and that is in the discovery
and defense of the new.</i>

1330
01:39:42,941 --> 01:39:47,541
<i>The world is often unkind
to new talent, new creations.</i>

1331
01:39:47,741 --> 01:39:50,241
<i>The new needs friends.</i>

1332
01:39:50,541 --> 01:39:54,041
<i>Last night,
I experienced something new,</i>

1333
01:39:54,241 --> 01:39:59,241
<i>an extraordinary meal
from a singularly unexpected source.</i>

1334
01:39:59,441 --> 01:40:02,041
<i>To say that both the meal
and its maker</i>

1335
01:40:02,141 --> 01:40:05,641
<i>have challenged my preconceptions
about fine cooking</i>

1336
01:40:05,741 --> 01:40:08,441
<i>is a gross understatement.</i>

1337
01:40:08,841 --> 01:40:12,041
<i>They have rocked me to my core.</i>

1338
01:40:12,841 --> 01:40:16,241
<i>In the past, I have made no secret
of my disdain</i>

1339
01:40:16,341 --> 01:40:21,341
<i>for Chef Gusteau's famous motto,
"Anyone can cook."</i>

1340
01:40:21,641 --> 01:40:27,841
<i>But I realize only now
do I truly understand what he meant.</i>

1341
01:40:28,141 --> 01:40:32,041
<i>Not everyone
can become a great artist,</i>

1342
01:40:32,241 --> 01:40:36,541
<i>but a great artist
can come from anywhere.</i>

1343
01:40:37,141 --> 01:40:40,441
<i>It is difficult to imagine
more humble origins</i>

1344
01:40:40,541 --> 01:40:44,341
<i>than those of the genius
now cooking at Gusteau's,</i>

1345
01:40:44,441 --> 01:40:47,341
<i>who is, in this critic's opinion,</i>

1346
01:40:47,441 --> 01:40:51,641
<i>nothing less
than the finest chef in France.</i>

1347
01:40:51,841 --> 01:40:53,741
<i>I will be returning to Gusteau's soon,
hungry for more.</i>

1348
01:40:53,741 --> 01:40:57,141
<i>I will be returning to Gusteau's soon,
hungry for more.</i>

1349
01:40:57,541 --> 01:40:59,041
<i>It was a great night.</i>

1350
01:40:59,141 --> 01:41:00,941
<i>The happiest of my life.</i>

1351
01:41:01,041 --> 01:41:05,541
<i>But the only thing predictable
about life is its unpredictability.</i>

1352
01:41:05,641 --> 01:41:08,841
<i>Well, we had to let Skinner
and the health inspector loose,</i>

1353
01:41:08,941 --> 01:41:11,341
<i>and of course 
they ratted us out.</i>

1354
01:41:11,741 --> 01:41:13,341
<i>The food didn't matter.</i>

1355
01:41:13,441 --> 01:41:15,841
<i>Once it got out
there were rats in the kitchen,</i>

1356
01:41:15,941 --> 01:41:17,941
<i>oh, man, 
the restaurant was closed</i>

1357
01:41:18,041 --> 01:41:20,841
and Ego lost his job 
and his credibility.

1358
01:41:20,941 --> 01:41:22,841
But don't feel too bad for him.

1359
01:41:22,941 --> 01:41:26,441
He's doing very well
as a small business investor.

1360
01:41:26,741 --> 01:41:29,341
- He seems very happy.
- How do you know?

1361
01:41:37,541 --> 01:41:39,641
Got to go. Dinner rush.

1362
01:41:47,241 --> 01:41:48,941
You know how he likes it.

1363
01:41:54,241 --> 01:41:55,841
Thanks, Little Chef.

1364
01:42:02,541 --> 01:42:05,341
Can I interest you
in a dessert this evening?

1365
01:42:05,441 --> 01:42:08,641
- Don't you always?
- Which one would you like?

1366
01:42:09,741 --> 01:42:11,541
Surprise me.

1367
01:42:17,041 --> 01:42:20,441
Can I interest you
in a dessert this evening?

1368
01:42:23,941 --> 01:42:27,541
Hey, believe me, that story
gets better when I tell it, okay?

1369
01:42:29,441 --> 01:42:32,541
Come on. 
Bring some food over here,
we're starving!
