Nice try.

All right. See you at
Wade's party tonight?

12
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:45,057
See you then.

13
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,229
So, it's just you and me
for the entire summer.

14

Next year you graduate,
join me at college.

Just like we planned.

16
00:03:53,966 --> 00:03:57,352
- Scott, we need to talk.
- Yeah? About what?

17
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,738
About me dumping you.

18
00:03:59,805 --> 00:04:01,023
Huh?

19
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:02,441
There he is!

20
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:06,245
The graduate and his
beautiful girlfriend. Ok?

21

I'm gonna need
a minute here, ok?

What do you mean,
you're dumping me?

26

Scott, I just can't take

27
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:22,594
All the lying and cheating
on each other anymore.

28
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:25,514
What are you talking about?
Sweetie, I never cheated on you.

29
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,666
I know. That's what
makes this so hard.

Scotty, it's not you.

It's me.

33
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:38,327
There I go, lying again.
No, it was you.

34
00:04:38,394 --> 00:04:40,512
You're just so...

35
00:04:40,563 --> 00:04:42,864

I thought that was just
for German class.

55
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:52,217
It was at first, but we're
actually becoming good friends.

56

He's a really cool guy.

"dear Mieke, greetings from
your American pen pal."

58

Scotty, girl scouts
have pen pals.

Listen to yourself,
all right?

60

You met a "cool guy"
on the "Internet."

This is how these
sexual predators work.

he'll want to
"arrange a meeting"

Where he will gas you,
stuff you in the back
of his van,

And make a windchime
out of your genitals.

get me gin and tonic?

85
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:18,103
- I hate gin.
- You do?

86
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:20,972

Yeah. I planned every
detail of the trip
to maximize the fun!

96
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,638
You brought a guidebook
to a party?

97
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:56,758

- Do you wanna see my balls?

98

you're gonna go first?

Paris!
I can't wait.

Two years ago Nicky Jager's
sister, Debbie,

101

Met a wealthy French guy,

102
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,904
And spent a month sailing
the Mediterranean on his yacht.

103
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,990
Isn't that the most romantic
thing you've ever heard?

104

Stuck on a boat
with a weird French guy?

105
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:17,696
That sounds a little gay.

106
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,999
It's not gay.
I'm a girl.

107

- Kinda gay.
- A little gay.

161
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:35,927
Oh, my god! Candy!

162
00:11:35,978 --> 00:11:38,029
Cooper!

163
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:41,950
Hey...

164
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:45,036
This isn't where
I parked my car.

165
00:11:47,323 --> 00:11:48,456
♪ Scotty doesn't know ♪

166
00:11:57,282 --> 00:11:59,084
Hey.

Scotty doesn't know!
Scotty doesn't know!

00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:07,559

<i>Mail, motherfucker!</i>

171
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:41,993
Hey, Mieke.

"arrange a meeting."

182
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:13,074
No, no, no! Come on!
Cooper was right.

183
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:15,243
This guy wants
to have sex with me.

184
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,963
"Listen, Mieke...

185
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:21,716
"I don't want to arrange
any meetings with you,

"Goodbye."

00:13:39,768 --> 00:13:40,735
Oww.

192
00:13:53,449 --> 00:13:58,069
I'm never drinking again.
Oh, that's nice.

193
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,341
Bert, what are you doing?

194
00:14:03,408 --> 00:14:05,076
Reading your email.

195
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:07,128
Don't do that.

196
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,715
Why are you wearing
my bathrobe?

197
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:12,750
Oh, I'm sorry...

198
00:14:12,801 --> 00:14:16,254
But somebody pissed
all over mine last night.

199
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:20,424
Wow. I can't believe
this German chick

200
00:14:20,476 --> 00:14:22,443
Wants to come here
and hook up with you.

201
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,029
I don't think so, buddy.
Mieke's a guy.

202
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:26,481
No, it says right here,

203
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:28,099
"trauriges madchen."

204
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:30,735
"I was a sad girl
to hear about Fiona."

205
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,203
Fuckin' a, Scott.

206
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:36,124
I'm taking "intro to German,"
and even I know that.

207
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,475
Come here.

208
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,711
He sent me a picture,
retardo.

209
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:43,548
See? That's a picture of Mieke
and his cute cousin, Jan.

210
00:14:43,615 --> 00:14:45,283
No, retardo.

211
00:14:45,334 --> 00:14:47,785
That's Jan, a man's name,

212
00:14:47,836 --> 00:14:49,254
And that's not "mike,"

213
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:52,173
It's "Mieke," a common
German girl's name,

214
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:54,092
Similar to our Michelle.

215
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:57,762
I hope you wrote her back
and told her to come visit.

216
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,432
You didn't?

217
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,768
You thought she was a guy!

218
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:06,938
I'm getting
the video camera! Ha!

219
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,724
What an asshole!

220
00:15:09,792 --> 00:15:11,359
No.

221
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:12,643
No.

222
00:15:12,695 --> 00:15:15,914
No!!

223
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:49,147
"Address blocked"?
"Email not delivered."

224
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,349
No... Come on!

225
00:15:52,234 --> 00:15:54,652
Hey, mom made waffles.

226
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:58,189
- What's going on?
- I'm in love with my pen pal.

227
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,191
I'm in love with Mieke.

228
00:16:02,578 --> 00:16:05,246
Ok... Ok.

229
00:16:06,582 --> 00:16:09,367
You know what?
I was actually
expecting this.

230
00:16:09,418 --> 00:16:11,219
Frankly, I'm flattered

231
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,371
You picked me
to come out to first.

232
00:16:13,422 --> 00:16:16,591
And don't worry about
telling your folks, 'cause...

233
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:19,560
- I think they already know.
- No, you idiot. Mike is a girl.

234
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,062
No, no, I get it.
Yeah.

235
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,014
He's the girl,
and you're the girl,

236
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,900
And sometimes
you're both the girl.

237
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,718
Right?

238
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:30,154
Right?
That's hot.

239
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:33,524
But whatever works for you.
I'm not gonna judge it.

240
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:36,727
Will you stop?
Look, come here.
Look at this picture.

241
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,831
Wow. Who's the hot chick?

242
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:43,001
That's "mike."
I mean, Mieke.

243
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:46,037
That's Mieke? That's who you've
been writing to all this time?

244
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,239
Until last night,
when I took your advice

245
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:51,075
And told her to keep her
"hands off my genitals."

246
00:16:51,126 --> 00:16:54,929
Given what we know now,
that seems like the exact
opposite of what you want.

247
00:16:57,716 --> 00:16:59,417
This is a total disaster.

248
00:16:59,468 --> 00:17:01,552
Oh, come on.
It's not that bad.

249
00:17:02,304 --> 00:17:04,022
Though she is really hot.

250
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:07,392
You're not listening.
I don't even care
what she looks like.

251
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:10,761
Mieke and I had
this incredible bond.

252
00:17:10,813 --> 00:17:12,980
I told her things
I couldn't even tell you.

253
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:15,967
Like what?

254
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,102
Nothing. It's a figure
of speech, coop.

255
00:17:18,153 --> 00:17:19,987
- No, seriously. What?
- Nothing. The point...

256
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:21,956
- You like me better, right?
- Listen...

257
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:26,294
This girl is not only
smart and funny,
and stunningly beautiful,

258
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,446
But until I screwed up,
she wanted to come

259
00:17:28,497 --> 00:17:30,665
All the way to America,
just to be with me.

260
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:33,885
- So do something about it.
- What can I do?

261
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:37,305
She blocked her email account,
her phone number's not listed.

262
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,474
The only thing I know
is she lives in Berlin.

263
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,008
So go to Berlin.

264
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:44,862
I can't just go
to Berlin, coop.

265
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,981
- Why not?
- Because...

266
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,983
I just can't, ok?

267
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,801
I'm supposed to work
for my dad this summer.

268
00:17:50,853 --> 00:17:53,154
It looks good on
my med school application.

269
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,089
Oh, Jesus, Scotty!

270
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:58,276
Man, Fiona was right.
You're so predictable.

271
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,254
- I'm going to Germany.
- No...

272
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:12,673
We're going to Germany.

273
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:22,333
How are we going
to get to Germany?

274
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:24,852
Don't worry.
I've got it covered.

275
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,723
We're going
to be couriers?

276
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:30,525
It's the best way
to get a cheap flight.

277
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,477
All we have to do
is carry their packages,

278
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,195
And then drop them off
when we get there.

279
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,863
My cousin did it
when he went to India.

280
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,231
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

281
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:40,818
Of course, he ended up using
a public restroom in New Delhi

282
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:44,355
And they had to
cut off his leg.
You know...

283
00:18:44,406 --> 00:18:47,158
But he got there cheap,
is what I'm saying.

284
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:50,411
Ok, I don't have anything
to Germany for a week.

285
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:54,632
But I can get you both
to London today for $118.

286
00:18:54,699 --> 00:18:57,335
- Anything else?
- Europe is like the size
of the Eastwood mall.

287
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,487
We can walk to Berlin
from there.

288
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,889
Cooper, England's an island.

289
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:05,009
Ok, swim. Whatever.

290
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,544
We'll take it.

291
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,827
- Hey.
- Hmm?

292
00:19:22,894 --> 00:19:24,529
Thanks for coming with me.

293
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,831
I know you had that internship
at the law firm this summer.

294
00:19:26,898 --> 00:19:29,250
Well, forget about
the law firm.

295
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:33,070
And don't thank me.
I should be thanking you.

296
00:19:33,121 --> 00:19:36,090
This trip is a
once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity for me

297
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,092
To broaden
my sexual horizons.

298
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,595
What are you
talking about?

299
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,930
I'm talking about
crazy European sex.

300
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,466
Ah.

301
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:48,586
You know America
was founded by prudes.

302
00:19:48,637 --> 00:19:51,138
Prudes who left Europe,
because they hated

303
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:55,426
All the kinky, steamy
European sex that was going on.

304
00:19:55,477 --> 00:19:59,030
And now I,
Cooper Harris,

305
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:02,149
Will return to the land
of my perverted forefathers

306
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:06,153
And claim my birthright,
which is a series

307
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:09,540
Of erotic and sexually
challenging adventures.

308
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:14,579
You've really thought a lot
about this, haven't you?

309
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,414
It's my passion.

310
00:20:30,846 --> 00:20:32,980
Come on, come on!

311
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,734
The adventure begins.

312
00:20:36,801 --> 00:20:39,604
Welcome to jolly
old England.

313
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:43,190
Yeah, breathe that sweet,
sexy, European air.

314
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,193
- Oh.
- What is that?

315
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:48,829
It's the phone they gave me
at the law firm.

316
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,531
Yeah, it's
pretty neat, huh?

317
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:52,316
- Works anywhere.
- Yeah?

318
00:20:52,367 --> 00:20:54,085
Excuse me.

319
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,004
Cooper here.

320
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,006
Hello, Mr. Walters.

321
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:02,209
Yes, sir, I'm down
in file storage.

322
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:04,128
Um, hang on one second.

323
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:12,470
No, sir, I can't find
the Gutterman file anywhere.

324
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,188
Yes, sir,
I'll keep looking.

325
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,107
I don't rest
until I find it.

326
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,527
Didn't tell your boss
you were leaving the country?

327
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:23,030
They would've
stopped paying me.
It seemed easier.

328
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,399
- So, where to?
- I don't know.

329
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:27,518
First bus to Berlin doesn't
leave till tomorrow morning.

330
00:21:27,569 --> 00:21:29,904
What do you wanna do?
Got the tower of London...

331
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:32,456
There's Buckingham palace.

332
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:34,659
- Uh...
- There's no drinking age.

333
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,577
- There you go!
- Come on.

334
00:21:37,913 --> 00:21:40,748
- Hey! "The feisty goat."

335
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,137
All right!

336
00:21:46,871 --> 00:21:49,039
What do you wanna...

337
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:01,902
Soccer hooligans.

338
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,942
Hey, this isn't where
I parked my car!

339
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,277
Oy!

340
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:13,497
Who the bloody hell are you?

341
00:22:14,616 --> 00:22:16,400
This is a private members bar,

342
00:22:16,451 --> 00:22:18,919
Exclusively
for the supporters

343
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,872
Of the greatest football
team in the world...

344
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:24,508
Manchester united.

345
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:27,762
Now please, enlighten me.

346
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,380
Who the fuck are you?!

347
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,182
That is a good question,

348
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:33,384
And... Scotty?

349
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:35,019
Huh?

350
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:41,525
We're the Manchester
united fan club...

351
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:43,361
From Ohio.

352
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:46,147
If you're Manchester united
supporters...

353
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:48,932
Sing the Manchester united song.

354
00:22:48,984 --> 00:22:50,768
Excuse me, I'm sorry...

355
00:22:50,819 --> 00:22:52,403
I'm not much
of a singer...

356
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:55,406
- Sing!!

Pretty good.

I've unblocked
your email address,

372
00:24:04,059 --> 00:24:07,061
But this Scott
is not responding.

373
00:24:09,064 --> 00:24:11,315
He was the one.

374
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,536
I was going to
give myself to him.

375
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:19,573
Perhaps you should give
yourself to someone else...

376
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:24,712
Fraulein.

377
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:47,968
I'm never drinking again.

378
00:24:48,036 --> 00:24:49,603
Coop, wake up.

379
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:52,356
Oh, man, that was
a wild night.

380
00:24:55,059 --> 00:24:56,694
You think?

381
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:06,387
Scotty, where the hell
are we going?

382
00:25:06,454 --> 00:25:08,789
Don't worry.
If anything bad happens,

383
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:10,407
My parents will find us.

384
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:13,460
Honey, where's Scotty?

385
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:16,463
Cooper said they were
going camping.

386
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:18,465
Oh, that's nice.

387
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,351
And where's Bert?

388
00:25:20,418 --> 00:25:22,720
Fuck if I know.

389
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,400
Hey!
How are you, you scalawag!

390
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:38,936
Look, given the current
geopolitical climate,

391
00:25:38,987 --> 00:25:42,105
All European countries should
have a seat at the table.

392
00:25:42,157 --> 00:25:44,708
- Right.
- Except those fucking ities.

393
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:47,044
I hate them
Italian bastards.

394
00:25:47,111 --> 00:25:49,046
- You know what I mean?
- Excuse me.

395
00:25:49,113 --> 00:25:50,464
Hello, boyo!

396
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,299
What the hell happened
last night?

397
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,785
You got steamed up,
pissed as a fart.

398
00:25:54,836 --> 00:25:56,620
Too much sauce, son.

399
00:25:56,671 --> 00:25:57,955
Don't worry.

400
00:25:58,006 --> 00:26:00,891
We come and got ya so
you wouldn't miss the trip.

401
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:02,793
What trip?

402
00:26:02,844 --> 00:26:04,395
Where are we going?

403
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:06,129
What do you mean,
where are we going?

404
00:26:06,181 --> 00:26:09,266
We're going to see the mighty
reds do the frogs in Paris.

405
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:10,234
Aren't we, boys?

406
00:26:10,301 --> 00:26:12,987
Yeah!

407
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,738
Why are you
yelling at me?

408
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:17,408
So I tell the swamp donkey
to sock it

409
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:20,277
Before I give her a trunky
in the tradesman's entrance

410
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:22,746
And have her lick
me yardballs!

411
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,333
Wow.

412
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:29,503
You guys are on like
a completely different level
of swearing over here.

413
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:32,623
Coop? Cooper,
we're going to Paris.

414
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,625
I know.
Cecil told me.

415
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:37,261
Mieke's in Berlin.
We're not going to Berlin.

416
00:26:37,328 --> 00:26:38,979
What are we gonna do?
We need a plan.

417
00:26:39,047 --> 00:26:42,766
See what I'm talking about?
This is predictable
Scotty talking.

418
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:45,436
Relax. Paris is practically
a suburb of Berlin.

419
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:47,638
It's a nothing commute.

420
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:50,024
This is why France and Germany
have always been allies.

421
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:51,341
Allies.

422
00:26:53,895 --> 00:26:56,280
The twins. The twins
were in Paris, right?

423
00:26:56,347 --> 00:26:59,533
We could give them a call.
They could help us out.
Let me see your phone.

424
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:02,803
All right, but I'm really
only supposed to use this
for business calls.

425
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:04,688
Hey, don't...

426
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,008
You're on the wrong side
of the road,

427
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,893
You snail-eating puffs.

428
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:30,030
Fuck off! Go on, you gaelic
fucking garlic-breath tossers!

429
00:27:30,098 --> 00:27:32,316
Piss off!
Get in here and say that,

430
00:27:32,383 --> 00:27:34,718
You froggy itie shities!

431
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:40,024
Fucking beep!

432
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:43,160
We'll beep, you bastard,
all over your fucking nose!

433
00:27:43,227 --> 00:27:45,245
Get out of the way!
Piss off!

434
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:54,571
Hey, lads!

435
00:27:54,622 --> 00:27:57,257
That wanker's got
a frog football shirt on!

436
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,593
Let's give this Nancy
a fucking good kicking!

437
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:02,245
Come on, lads,
he's going off!

438
00:28:17,479 --> 00:28:20,263
All right. Twins said
they'd meet us here.

439
00:28:20,315 --> 00:28:21,264
Look at that!

440
00:28:21,316 --> 00:28:23,117
There they are.
Come on. Jenny!

441
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,452
- Jamie!
- Hey!

442
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:26,537
Come here!

443
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:27,705
No, no.
No, no, no!

444
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:30,324
<i>- Scott, bienvenu Paris.
- Thank you.</i>

445
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:33,043
- Is that a new camera?
- It isn't just a camera,

446
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:35,045
This is a Leica m7.

447
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:37,214
Uber-sensitive
exposure settings,

448
00:28:37,281 --> 00:28:39,049
Legendary cloth
shutter system.

449
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:41,785
- Let me see that thing.
- No can do.

450
00:28:41,836 --> 00:28:44,888
I spent the last four years
tutoring lacrosse players
to pay for it,

451
00:28:44,956 --> 00:28:47,925
So nobody touches
my camera but me.

452
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:50,177
- So it's like your wiener.
- No, it's not like...

453
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:52,462
- Jenny...
- Cooper, leave him alone.

454
00:28:52,514 --> 00:28:55,983
Wow, I can't believe
you came all the way
to Europe for a girl.

455
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,601
Wait, not just any girl.

456
00:28:57,652 --> 00:28:59,570
Show her the picture,
Scotty.

457
00:28:59,637 --> 00:29:02,322
She makes every girl in our
high school look like a walrus.

458
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,558
I'm a girl
from your high school.

459
00:29:04,626 --> 00:29:06,076
No, I mean "girl" girls.

460
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:08,979
Guys, we're wasting
the whole day here.
We're in Paris!

461
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:10,414
Let's go to the louvre!

462
00:29:10,481 --> 00:29:12,366
To the Louvre!

463
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,518
So, you guys
wanna stay here,

464
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:51,622
Or should we check out
the huge line
at the Eiffel tower?

465
00:29:51,689 --> 00:29:53,123
Here's a fun fact.

466
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:55,626
Voltaire contracted syphilis
just two blocks from here.

467
00:29:55,693 --> 00:29:57,861
- Should we go?
- Can we please get out of here?

468
00:29:57,912 --> 00:30:01,114
- This guy's really
creeping me out.
- Who, robot man?

469
00:30:01,182 --> 00:30:03,967
He's just trying to feed
his robot family.

470
00:30:04,035 --> 00:30:06,336
- I really don't like him.
- Why?

471
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:09,640
Because he's doing this?

472
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:11,541
Ok, seriously,
don't do that.

473
00:30:11,593 --> 00:30:13,894
Cooper.
Do not hate me.

474
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:18,765
I am familiar with
over 600 dance moves

475
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:20,984
And I am programmed
to get...

476
00:30:25,056 --> 00:30:27,241
Freaky.

477
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:41,588
You're just upset because
people like me better.

478
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:42,589
It's okay.

479
00:31:08,149 --> 00:31:09,432
Oh!

481
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:24,948

00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,316
Ha! Ha! Ha!

484
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:49,472
Don't look in his eyes, Scotty.

485
00:31:54,812 --> 00:31:57,331
- Ohhh!
- That was not cool.

486
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:25,342
- Oh!

487
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:30,247
Guys, let's go.
Come on.

488
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:37,654
Error! Error! Error!

489
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:40,490
How cool is this?

490
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:43,293
It's a shame we only get
to spend one day together.

491
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:45,829
- Why don't you come to Berlin?
- Umm, no.

492
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:49,032
Jamie, come on.
In a few months, we all
go to different colleges.

493
00:32:49,083 --> 00:32:53,036
This could be the last
chance the four of us
are together like this.

494
00:32:53,087 --> 00:32:54,972
Plus, we're in Europe. Huh?

495
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,140
This should be
the trip of a lifetime.

496
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:59,376
There's no way
we should split up.

497
00:32:59,427 --> 00:33:03,063
All right, this table
is now Europe, ok?

498
00:33:04,098 --> 00:33:05,399
Excuse me.

499
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:08,752
We are right here,
in Paris,

500
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,021
And I have got
to get to Mieke,

501
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:13,523
Who is over here,
in Berlin.

502
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:15,558
If you come with us,
I'm sure there's a ton

503
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:17,861
Of great stuff to see
along the way.

504
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:21,748
- We can go to Denmark.
- I love Denmark.

505
00:33:21,816 --> 00:33:24,368
- We gotta hit Amsterdam.
- Definitely.

506
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:27,371
And the cathedral
at Cameret!

507
00:33:28,572 --> 00:33:30,540
- Yeah...
- Maybe. We'll see.

508
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:33,076
- Whatever.
- If there's time.

509
00:33:34,796 --> 00:33:37,180
Come on! I really want you
to be there when I meet Mieke.

510
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:39,132
Fine.

511
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:40,884
- Excellent!
- All right!

512
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:44,021
- A toast!
- Yes!

513
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:46,223
- To Mieke!
- To Europe!

514
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:47,708
To Europe!

515
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:49,443
<i>Merci.</i>

516
00:33:50,761 --> 00:33:53,447
- Berlin, here we come!
- All right.

517
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,115
Better let me
hold on to those.

518
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:03,123
- What the hell is that?
- It's a traveler's money belt.

519
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,459
Frommer's says as long
as you have one of these,

520
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,294
No one can rob you
of anything.

521
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:08,912
Except your dignity.

522
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:11,548
No, you just put that
in your...

523
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:12,949
Wait... What?

524
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,452
Come on, guidebook.
Let's go.

525
00:34:18,005 --> 00:34:19,489
Check it out.

526
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:22,092
European ass.

527
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,762
What's up?

528
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:31,968
Jesus, jenny.

529
00:34:32,019 --> 00:34:34,654

530
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,857
Thanks.

531
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:39,476
Damn!

532
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:45,315
I believe this is yours.

533
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,653
Pleased to meet you.

534
00:34:50,705 --> 00:34:52,289
My name is Christoph.

535
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,158
- Jenny, let's go!
- Move it!

536
00:34:55,209 --> 00:34:58,512
Those are my friends.
We're supposed to get
on a train to berlin...

538
00:35:00,882 --> 00:35:04,334
So, it was really nice
to meet you.

539
00:35:04,385 --> 00:35:06,319

- What?

564
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:13,156
Big tunnel.

565
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:20,313
Who's touching me?
Scotty, is that you?

566
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:22,248
Who's touching me?!
Scotty!

567
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:31,374

570

Crans sur mer.
We change trains here.

571
00:39:10,131 --> 00:39:12,799
Well, we got a couple
of hours to kill.

572
00:39:12,883 --> 00:39:14,584
What's there to see
in this town?

573
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:17,721
<i>Hello? The monument
des poissoni res.</i>

574
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:21,057
It's a monument to all
the local fishermen
who were lost at sea.

575
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:24,260
Frommer's says it's supposed
to be... "quite moving."

576
00:39:24,311 --> 00:39:27,147
What the hell is wrong
with you, c-3po?

577
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:30,099
We're here to see Europe,
not some crappy statue.

578
00:39:30,151 --> 00:39:32,152
I'm taking a nap.

579
00:39:32,236 --> 00:39:34,287
Wake me up when
the train gets here.

580
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:37,540
Hmm. Says here this town
has a famous nude beach.

581
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:40,160
All right, we can't all
just lie around all day.

582
00:39:40,244 --> 00:39:43,046
We gotta get out there
and experience the culture
firsthand.

583
00:39:43,113 --> 00:39:45,498
Let's go exploring!

584
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:50,587
So, what's the etiquette
on boners?

585
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:52,505
Do I roll over and dig out
a hole for it,

586
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:55,642
Or is it cool to just
let my flag fly?

587
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:58,228
Wait, wait.

588
00:39:58,295 --> 00:40:00,847
Does "nude beach" mean
we have to get naked, too?

589
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:02,632
Of course.

590
00:40:02,683 --> 00:40:04,100
Do you think you
can go an hour

591
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:06,302
Without your currency
colostomy bag?

592
00:40:06,353 --> 00:40:09,572
As long as this thing has
our money and passports in it,

593
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:13,243
It's not coming off, and my
trunks won't come off, either.

594
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:14,577
Come on.

595
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:16,813
You came all the way
to Europe.

596
00:40:16,864 --> 00:40:18,698
Can't wimp out now.

597
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:21,918
Ok.

598
00:40:21,985 --> 00:40:23,753
All right,
on the count of three.

599
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:24,921

00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,344
Very funny.
Very funny.

603
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,662
All right.

604
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:37,333
Let the crazy European
sex odyssey begin.

- Really?

606
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:39,936

- Hello, ladies!

608
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:54,984
- Ladies?
- Bitches?

609
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:04,494
Eww! What a rip!
There's no nude girls here,

610
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:06,696
Just guys like us
looking for nude girls.

611
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:08,998

You just use the safe word.

756

Until we hear the safe word,
we will not stop.

Yeah, right. Stop.
All right.

'cause I'm really hot.

00:53:19,062 --> 00:53:21,096
You sold us a bad batch
of hash brownies.

797
00:53:21,147 --> 00:53:23,148
You're a bad rastafarian.

798
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:25,818
These are not hash brownies.

799
00:53:25,902 --> 00:53:27,269
Hmm?

800
00:53:28,905 --> 00:53:32,208
- What was that?
- We do not sell hash brownies.

801
00:53:32,275 --> 00:53:34,460
We're a simple dutch bakery!

802
00:53:38,448 --> 00:53:41,116
Now put your clothes
back on, white boy!

803
00:53:42,285 --> 00:53:45,087
Ow! Ow! Ow!

804
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:46,922
<i>"fluggengegeholen!"</i>

805
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:51,093
<i>Did you say fluggegecheimen?</i>

806
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:52,177
Yes! Yes!

807
00:53:52,262 --> 00:53:54,930
<i>For the love of god,
fluggengecheimen!</i>

808
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:56,649
Are you sure?

809
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:57,966
Yes, please.

810
00:53:58,018 --> 00:54:00,152
As you wish.

811
00:54:01,521 --> 00:54:03,772
<i>Bring on
the fluggegecheimen!</i>

812
00:54:06,809 --> 00:54:09,111
Wait... What?

813
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:11,146
Uh-oh.

814
00:54:11,197 --> 00:54:14,450
<i>No, no, no!
I didn't say fluggegecheimen,</i>

815
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:15,618
I said, uh...

816
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:37,356
What'd you do last night?

817
00:54:39,559 --> 00:54:41,644
I don't want to
talk about it.

818
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:42,995
What did you guys do?

819
00:54:43,063 --> 00:54:45,281
Don't want
to talk about it.

820
00:54:47,651 --> 00:54:51,370
- What is that?
- Free t-shirt.

821
00:54:55,858 --> 00:54:57,526
Hey, guys.

822
00:54:58,478 --> 00:55:00,496
What happened to you?

823
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:02,197
I got robbed.

824
00:55:02,248 --> 00:55:04,466
It was awesome!

825
00:55:06,035 --> 00:55:08,370
All our money,
our passports, our tickets...

826
00:55:08,421 --> 00:55:10,556
Everything, gone!

827
00:55:11,874 --> 00:55:13,709
How the hell
could this happen?

828
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,878
We all go to Amsterdam, and
Jamie's the one who hooks up!

829
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:20,065
For shame!

830
00:55:28,692 --> 00:55:31,193
Oh, that's me.

831
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:35,948
Coop here. Sorry.

832
00:55:36,032 --> 00:55:38,900
Hello, Mr. Walters.

833
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:42,504
You never got
the Gutterman file?

834
00:55:42,572 --> 00:55:44,506
I told Humphrey
to give it to you.

835
00:55:44,574 --> 00:55:48,794
That's hogwash. I handed it
to him myself yesterday.

836
00:55:48,878 --> 00:55:51,964
Yes, sir, I will tell
Humphrey to report to
your office immediately.

837
00:55:52,048 --> 00:55:54,082
Bye.

838
00:55:55,585 --> 00:55:58,554
- This job's killing me.

839
00:56:09,232 --> 00:56:11,650
- Uh...
- Let me handle this.

840
00:56:11,735 --> 00:56:14,069
I speak bad German.

841
00:56:37,343 --> 00:56:40,095
- What did he say?
- He said he's driving.

842
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:41,463
- Oh.
- Something.

843
00:56:41,514 --> 00:56:43,298
<i>Ja.</i>

844
00:56:46,936 --> 00:56:48,103
Berlin?

845
00:56:57,647 --> 00:56:59,815
- Berlin?
- Berlin!

846
00:57:05,121 --> 00:57:07,339
- He's going to Berlin!
- Awesome!

847
00:57:09,659 --> 00:57:12,795
- All right! Berlin!
- Come on, let's go!

848
00:57:21,137 --> 00:57:23,439
Next stop, Berlin!

849
00:57:45,528 --> 00:57:48,747
Beautiful!
We made it to Berlin.

850
00:57:48,832 --> 00:57:50,966
<i>Ja. Berlin!</i>

851
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:57,639
- Bratislava?
- Yeah.

852
00:57:57,707 --> 00:57:59,708
Bratislava!

853
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:08,484
Dear sweet
mother of god.

854
00:58:08,551 --> 00:58:10,602
We're in eastern Europe.

855
00:58:13,222 --> 00:58:14,389
Eww!

856
00:58:36,963 --> 00:58:38,914
Excuse me.

857
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:41,600
Do you speak any English?

858
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:44,686
You are Americans?

859
00:58:44,754 --> 00:58:46,087
Yeah.

860
00:58:46,139 --> 00:58:48,089
I love America.

861
00:58:49,142 --> 00:58:52,427
We just get "Miami vice"
on television.

862
00:58:52,478 --> 00:58:55,731
"Miami Vice" is number one
new show.

863
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:57,115
Yeah.

864
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:00,903
Listen, we're trying
to get to Berlin, Germany.

865
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:03,238
Do you know if there's
a train coming anytime soon?

866
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:06,825
Oh, yes, very soon.
They are building it now.

867
00:59:10,613 --> 00:59:13,215
Stop! Hammer time!

868
00:59:13,282 --> 00:59:15,467
Enjoy Bratislava!

869
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:17,953
It's good you came in summer.

870
00:59:18,004 --> 00:59:22,474
In winter, it can get
very depressing.

871
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:25,677
We gotta
figure something out.
How much money do we have?

872
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,734
Frommer's travel tip.

873
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:35,821
I don't have anything.

874
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:38,240
What? I got noth...
Fine.

875
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:47,532
$1.83 American.

876
00:59:47,617 --> 00:59:49,418
What are we gonna
get with that?

877
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:58,760
Gotta love that exchange rate!

878
00:59:59,829 --> 01:00:01,380
Ta.

879
01:00:05,468 --> 01:00:08,387
<i>hapi djus.</i>

880
01:00:08,471 --> 01:00:10,055
<i>teraz bez drenei.</i>

881
01:00:10,139 --> 01:00:14,192
Hmm. Now with less pulp.

882
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:16,061
Dinner is served.

883
01:00:16,145 --> 01:00:18,680
Would the masters care
for anything else?

884
01:00:18,731 --> 01:00:20,532
Think we're good.
Thanks.

885
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:24,653
Ah! A nickel!

886
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:27,990
You see this?

887
01:00:28,992 --> 01:00:32,411
- I quit!

888
01:00:32,495 --> 01:00:35,213
I open my own hotel!

889
01:00:42,872 --> 01:00:45,373
So, we got
27 cents left.

890
01:00:45,425 --> 01:00:47,592
What is there to do
in this town?

891
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:57,402
<i>- ♪ My Scotty ♪
- ♪ Scotty, Scotty ♪</i>

892
01:00:57,487 --> 01:01:01,106
<i> ♪ Scotty doesn't know ♪</i>

893
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:03,108
<i>♪ don't tell Scotty ♪</i>

894
01:01:04,794 --> 01:01:07,112
<i>- ♪ Scotty doesn't know ♪</i>

895
01:01:07,196 --> 01:01:09,247
This song
sounds familiar.

896
01:01:11,901 --> 01:01:15,504
Jenny, lemme check
your coat.

897
01:01:19,859 --> 01:01:21,877
- Hey!
- Jenny!

898
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:25,280
That outfit is horrible!
Just take it off... Now!

899
01:01:26,549 --> 01:01:30,135
No, but I will let you
buy me a drink.

900
01:01:30,219 --> 01:01:31,470
Excuse me!

901
01:01:33,422 --> 01:01:36,058
You are the woman from the Paris
train station, aren't you?

902
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:37,893
- My name is...
- Christoph.

903
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:39,594
Yes.

904
01:01:39,645 --> 01:01:41,313
What are you doing here?

905
01:01:41,397 --> 01:01:42,597
This is my place.

906
01:01:42,648 --> 01:01:45,484
My family owns many nightclubs
throughout Europe.

907
01:01:45,568 --> 01:01:47,869
I'd be honored if you'd
join me in my v.I.P. Room
for a drink.

908
01:01:47,937 --> 01:01:49,871
Mmm-kay.

909
01:01:52,325 --> 01:01:53,558
Bye, Cooper.

910
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:03,135
- What's that?
- It's absinthe.

911
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:05,137
Frommer's says it's
illegal in the states

912
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:07,806
Because it makes you
hallucinate and go crazy.

913
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:10,092
They call it
"the green fairy."

914
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:19,735
My family has a yacht
in the Aegean.

915
01:02:19,802 --> 01:02:23,138
Come with me, Jennifer.
We will sail away together.

916
01:02:23,189 --> 01:02:25,190
Oh, my god!

917
01:02:25,274 --> 01:02:28,493
We will swim with dolphins,
and sip champagne by moonlight.

918
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:31,129
Oh, my god!

919
01:02:31,197 --> 01:02:34,199
We will spend the day
sunbathing, drinking wine.

920
01:02:34,283 --> 01:02:36,585
My wife makes
the best sangria.

921
01:02:36,652 --> 01:02:38,587
Wait... What?

922
01:02:38,654 --> 01:02:40,205
Sangria.

923
01:02:40,289 --> 01:02:42,007
You take a good
Spanish rioja,

924
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:44,325
And you put in slices
of orange, and...

925
01:02:44,377 --> 01:02:47,012
No, wait.
You said you were married?

926
01:02:48,881 --> 01:02:51,967
You just go around
Europe, sleeping with
every woman you meet?

927
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:54,386
No, please, Jennifer.
It is not like that.

928
01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:56,354
I also sleep with men.

929
01:03:00,526 --> 01:03:03,145
I gotta say,
I'm not feeling anything.

930
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:04,613
Me neither.

931
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:06,448
Sober as a judge.

932
01:03:08,184 --> 01:03:09,234
How 'bout you?

933
01:03:09,318 --> 01:03:11,286
I'm not feeling
a goddamn thing.

934
01:03:11,353 --> 01:03:13,972
This absinthe is bullshit!

935
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,657
I hear you, my brother.

936
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:17,576
I'm outta here.

937
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:19,127
Excuse me.

938
01:03:19,195 --> 01:03:22,497
- Hey, so where's Christoph?
- Shut up.

939
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:46,104
- Europe!
- Europe!

940
01:03:46,189 --> 01:03:49,908
- Whoo!
- Europe!

941
01:04:03,956 --> 01:04:05,457
So, tomorrow, Berlin.

942
01:04:05,541 --> 01:04:07,408
Tomorrow, Mieke!

943
01:04:14,416 --> 01:04:15,383
Check it out.

944
01:04:15,434 --> 01:04:17,752
No way!

945
01:04:17,803 --> 01:04:21,022
Jamie's hooking up
with another girl?
Goddamn it!

946
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:24,192
It's just so unfair.
I've been all over,

947
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:27,762
Looking for crazy European sex,
and he's the one who ends up...

948
01:04:27,813 --> 01:04:29,931
Oh, my god!

949
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:37,072
That is some pretty
fucked-up shit.

950
01:04:40,243 --> 01:04:44,913
Can you say, "what the fuck
did I do last night?"

951
01:04:57,093 --> 01:05:01,146
They really are
the worst twins ever.

952
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:30,458
That was a pretty
wild night, eh?

953
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:34,329
Yep. Pretty wild,
pretty wild.

954
01:05:36,882 --> 01:05:38,833
I know I was out of control.

955
01:05:38,884 --> 01:05:40,435
How about you guys?
Did you...?

956
01:05:40,502 --> 01:05:43,338
All right, look.
We were really drunk,

957
01:05:43,389 --> 01:05:45,840
Things got a little crazy,
and jamie...

958
01:05:45,891 --> 01:05:47,809
...Kissed me.

959
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:50,645
Let's just forget
about it, kay?

960
01:05:50,696 --> 01:05:53,081
- Consider it forgotten.
- Never happened.

961
01:05:53,149 --> 01:05:54,950
Never happened.

962
01:05:55,017 --> 01:05:58,286
Fine. Let's just
forget about it.

963
01:05:58,354 --> 01:06:01,539
It's not like
you two had sex.

964
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:02,857
Have you had sex?

965
01:06:02,908 --> 01:06:05,193
- Shut up, Cooper!
- Jamie, relax.

966
01:06:05,244 --> 01:06:06,578
Cooper. Please?

967
01:06:06,662 --> 01:06:09,047
Ok, fine.
I'll give it a rest.

968
01:06:11,417 --> 01:06:14,836
Jamie, could I borrow
your Frommer's?

969
01:06:18,891 --> 01:06:20,708
Oh, here it is.
Bratislava.

970
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:23,044
Hmm. Capital of Slovakia.

971
01:06:23,095 --> 01:06:25,263
Oh, here's a fun fact.

972
01:06:26,599 --> 01:06:28,566
You made out with
your sister, man!

973
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:31,770
- Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
- Like two dogs in heat.

974
01:06:35,107 --> 01:06:37,909
My friends, where is the beef?

975
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:42,897
You go to Berlin?
I'm your ride.

976
01:06:42,948 --> 01:06:44,416
Hop in.

978
01:07:11,143 --> 01:07:13,945
This is Mieke's
apartment building.

979
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:16,431
Wish me all sorts
of luck, guys.

980
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:19,417
You'll do great,
Scotty.

981
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:23,288
Thanks.

982
01:07:43,292 --> 01:07:46,928
I came all this way.
I'm not gonna miss this.

983
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:55,687
- Dude, Mieke's hideous! Run!
- Stop.

984
01:08:07,816 --> 01:08:09,584
Hi, my name
is Scott Thomas.

985
01:08:09,651 --> 01:08:11,853
I'm from America,
and I'm here to see Mieke.

986
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:14,339
I'm sorry, but
Mieke's not here.

987
01:08:14,423 --> 01:08:15,840
Do you know where she is?

988
01:08:15,908 --> 01:08:17,976
She's gone for the summer.

989
01:08:31,607 --> 01:08:35,610
My daughter had intended to
spend the summer in America,

990
01:08:35,677 --> 01:08:38,113
Looking at colleges
and visiting some friends.

991
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:40,899
But several days ago,
she suddenly changed her mind.

992
01:08:40,966 --> 01:08:42,867
She would not tell me why.

993
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:46,037
I think I know why.

994
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:54,712
This is Heinrich.
He's Mieke's stepbrother.

995
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:57,865
As I was saying, she packed
up her bag and left.

996
01:08:57,917 --> 01:09:00,535
- It was all very sudden.
- Do you know where she is now?

997
01:09:00,586 --> 01:09:04,038
As you know,
she's always been very
interested in the classics,

998
01:09:04,089 --> 01:09:06,307
Greek and roman literature
and history,

999
01:09:06,375 --> 01:09:08,209
And she's always
enjoyed the ocean,

1000
01:09:08,260 --> 01:09:11,396
So she found a program that
combines all her interests.

1001
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:13,148
Do you know where she is?

1002
01:09:13,215 --> 01:09:17,685
She enrolled in a summer at sea
program, based in Rome.

1003
01:09:17,736 --> 01:09:20,405
Rome.

1004
01:09:20,489 --> 01:09:23,191
Ok, then I guess
we'll go to Rome, then.

1005
01:09:23,242 --> 01:09:26,077
Unfortunately, Mieke's only
in Rome for orientation.

1006
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:29,414
Tomorrow her group boards
a boat and she'll be
gone for the summer.

1007
01:09:29,498 --> 01:09:32,617
She'll be quite unreachable.

1008
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:35,036
Unreachable.

1009
01:09:41,410 --> 01:09:44,712
Mieke's tour group goes
to the Vatican tomorrow,

1010
01:09:44,763 --> 01:09:46,914
Then she gets on that boat
and she's gone.

1011
01:09:46,966 --> 01:09:48,466
So, it's over?

1012
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:54,722
Thanks for sticking with me
through this, guys, but...

1013
01:09:54,773 --> 01:09:57,091
You should probably call
your parents,

1014
01:09:57,142 --> 01:10:00,245
Have them wire you
some money and go home.

1015
01:10:00,312 --> 01:10:02,013
What are you gonna do?

1016
01:10:02,081 --> 01:10:08,036
I'm going to Rome.
I'll walk, I'll hitchhike,

1017
01:10:08,103 --> 01:10:11,072
I'll swim if I have to,
but I'll get to Mieke somehow.

1018
01:10:15,777 --> 01:10:17,378
Maybe that'll help.

1019
01:10:17,446 --> 01:10:18,830
Where'd you get
all that?

1020
01:10:18,914 --> 01:10:21,799
Wait. Where's your Leica?

1021
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:23,635
Sold it.

1022
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:25,386
What?

1023
01:10:26,955 --> 01:10:29,757
You sold your Leica?
But you loved that thing.

1024
01:10:29,808 --> 01:10:32,427
What about your
photo tour of Europe?
What about the chateaus?

1025
01:10:32,478 --> 01:10:35,096
Chateaus have been there
for 300 years.

1026
01:10:35,147 --> 01:10:36,981
Mieke's gone in 12 hours.

1027
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:42,136
Let's go!
Frommer's says to check in

1028
01:10:42,187 --> 01:10:44,439
Three hours before
any international flight.

1029
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:46,524
Come here, guidebook!

1030
01:10:46,609 --> 01:10:49,527
Whoo! We're going to Rome.
We're going to Rome!

All right,
summer at sea group.

1039
01:11:23,845 --> 01:11:25,947
Our tour begins
in the Vatican museum.

1040
01:11:26,014 --> 01:11:28,015
This way, please.

1041
01:11:35,407 --> 01:11:37,909
There it is.

1042
01:11:43,365 --> 01:11:46,868
This entrance is for
private tour groups only.

1043
01:11:48,704 --> 01:11:51,339
Oh... But we are
a private tour group.

1044
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:53,541
We've come all the way
from America.

1045
01:11:56,211 --> 01:11:59,230
That guy in the orange jacket
is mentally retarded.

1046
01:12:03,686 --> 01:12:08,740
<i>Si, I can tell.
How very, very sad.</i>

1047
01:12:08,824 --> 01:12:10,825
Yes, it is.

1048
01:12:10,892 --> 01:12:13,094
But if you are a tour,
where is your guide?

1049
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:15,346
We've got a fantastic
tour guide.

1050
01:12:15,414 --> 01:12:18,232
- Right here.
- What? No...

1051
01:12:20,803 --> 01:12:24,238
The Vatican has been used
as a papal residence

1052
01:12:24,289 --> 01:12:26,624
Ever since the time of
Constantine the great

1053
01:12:26,709 --> 01:12:28,376
Of the 5th century a.D.!

1054
01:12:30,245 --> 01:12:32,246
Oh.

1055
01:12:32,297 --> 01:12:36,134
Ok... Um... If you'll
all follow me, please.

1056
01:12:39,888 --> 01:12:42,523
Have a very special day

1057
01:12:42,591 --> 01:12:46,978
For a very special
little man.

1058
01:12:47,062 --> 01:12:48,696
Ok.

1059
01:12:50,449 --> 01:12:53,217
I can't believe
that guy let us in.

1060
01:12:53,285 --> 01:12:54,986
What a retard!

1061
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:56,738
<i>- Let's find Mieke.
- Scusate.</i>

1062
01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:01,292
One of our English-speaking
tour guides has called in sick.

1063
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:04,579
Could you please take
these peoples also?

1064
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:10,385
- How big is Vatican city?
- .5 square kilometers.

1065
01:13:10,452 --> 01:13:14,389
- Who built the colonnades?
- Gianlorenzo Bernini, 1656.

1066
01:13:14,456 --> 01:13:17,341
- Where are the bathrooms?
- Floors 2, 6 and 7.

1067
01:13:17,426 --> 01:13:20,762
Next I'll take you to where
the college of cardinals
elects a new pope.

1068
01:13:20,813 --> 01:13:24,599
When this happens, white smoke
is sent up from the Vatican.
Here's a fun fact...

1069
01:13:24,666 --> 01:13:26,901
Mieke's gotta be
around here somewhere.

1070
01:13:26,968 --> 01:13:28,469
Let's go.

1071
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:40,081
<i>Behind me is the
appartamento papale,</i>

1072
01:13:40,148 --> 01:13:43,618
Or "papal apartment."
we're obviously not permitted.

1073
01:13:44,653 --> 01:13:47,622
Excuse me, miss.
What is this?

1074
01:13:47,689 --> 01:13:49,323
That is the bell of san Marco.

1075
01:13:49,374 --> 01:13:51,709
When the pope dies,
the cardinal vicar of Rome

1076
01:13:51,794 --> 01:13:54,345
Rings this bell to notify
the people of Rome.

1077
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:58,165
Next we will view
the Sistine chapel.
Follow me, please.

1078
01:13:59,768 --> 01:14:03,387
Come on.
I think I hear them.

1079
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:04,972
Which way did they go?

1080
01:14:05,023 --> 01:14:07,275
That way. I'd stake
my reputation on it.

1081
01:14:07,342 --> 01:14:09,176
Good enough for me.

1082
01:14:09,228 --> 01:14:12,697
Hey, check it out!
I wonder what this does.

1083
01:14:12,781 --> 01:14:16,784
It doesn't do anything,
it's a rope. Come on, let's go.

1084
01:14:16,852 --> 01:14:18,920
They got a lot
of old stuff here.

1085
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:27,795
<i>Dio mio!</i>

1086
01:14:28,497 --> 01:14:30,798
The bell of san marco!

1087
01:14:32,534 --> 01:14:34,418
The pope is dead!

1088
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:39,590
Whoa.

1089
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:44,262
She's not in here.

1090
01:14:44,329 --> 01:14:46,681
Let's go.
We're definitely not
supposed to be in here.

1091
01:14:46,732 --> 01:14:49,183
Hey, check this out!

1092
01:14:49,251 --> 01:14:51,686
- I'm the pope!
- Cooper...

1093
01:14:51,737 --> 01:14:54,322
Take off the pope hat.

1094
01:14:54,389 --> 01:14:58,609
- Oh, no. It's ok. I'm catholic.
- Take it off, goddamnit!

1095
01:14:58,677 --> 01:15:01,562
Oh, you took the
lord's name in vain!

1096
01:15:01,613 --> 01:15:04,031
Only I can forgive
you now, my son.

1097
01:15:04,082 --> 01:15:05,616
Take that fudging thing off!

1098
01:15:05,701 --> 01:15:07,919
The pope breaks
an open-field tackle.

1099
01:15:08,003 --> 01:15:10,571
It's a hail Mary,
he catches at the 40...

1100
01:15:10,622 --> 01:15:12,907
The 30, the 20, the 10...

1101
01:15:12,958 --> 01:15:15,259
Touchdown, pope!

1102
01:15:16,411 --> 01:15:19,246
The pope makes
a two-point conversion.

1103
01:15:19,298 --> 01:15:21,766
And oh, my lord!
It's the pope, eight,

1104
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:24,251
And the heathens, nothing!

1105
01:15:25,888 --> 01:15:28,523
How's you, sucka?

1106
01:15:30,859 --> 01:15:32,777
Cooper, the hat!
The hat!

1107
01:15:32,861 --> 01:15:34,261
The hat is on fire!

from Vatican square

1117
01:16:05,978 --> 01:16:08,629
Where the college of cardinals,
in a surprise move,

1118
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:13,184
<i>Has just elected a new pope.
  The crowd is very excited.</i>

1119

This is so strange.

1120

to elect a new pope.

- What are you doing in Rome?
- I came here to be with you.

1153
01:19:00,819 --> 01:19:03,521
Listen, I just traveled
all the way across Europe.

1154
01:19:03,605 --> 01:19:05,990
I got chased by naked men.

1155
01:19:06,074 --> 01:19:09,577
I ate brownies with absolutely
no drugs in them.

1156
01:19:09,644 --> 01:19:13,748
I watched a brother
and sister make out.

1157
01:19:13,815 --> 01:19:17,868
I kicked a robot in the balls,
but I did it all so that...

the only one who didn't
hook up while we were here.

1171
01:20:31,893 --> 01:20:34,745
Europe is officially
the worst country on earth.

1172

1173

Excuse me.

1187
01:21:47,068 --> 01:21:50,521
You're the young man who
gave me that tour of
the Vatican, aren't you?

1188
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:55,976
- Listen, I'm very sorry...
- I just wanted to thank you.

1189
01:21:56,027 --> 01:21:59,479

But I'm not actually
a tour guide.

1193
01:22:05,503 --> 01:22:08,372
I've just read Frommer's
enough to have it memorized.

1194
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:11,292
Although I threw in a few things
Frommer's didn't know about.

1195
01:22:11,343 --> 01:22:13,127
How would you like to add them?

1196
01:22:13,178 --> 01:22:14,628
Excuse me?

1197
01:22:14,679 --> 01:22:17,731
That's my guidebook.

Frommer's is going to
pay me to see every museum
and cathedral in Europe.

1201

I figured, since you're
going to be staying,

1204
01:22:41,289 --> 01:22:43,690
You might need this.

1205
01:22:43,742 --> 01:22:46,543
- A disposable camera.
- That's right.
