1
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,406
"The Importance of Being Earnest."

2
00:01:44,024 --> 00:01:46,445
Eating as usual, I see, Algy.

3
00:01:46,551 --> 00:01:48,437
I believe it is usual in good society...

4
00:01:48,535 --> 00:01:50,868
to take some slight refreshment
after morning exercise.

5
00:01:52,022 --> 00:01:54,126
And what brings you to London,
my dear Ernest?

6
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:57,773
Oh, pleasure, pleasure.
What else should bring one anywhere?

7
00:01:57,877 --> 00:01:59,916
Where have you been
since last Thursday?

8
00:02:00,021 --> 00:02:02,922
- In the country.
- What on earth do you do there?

9
00:02:03,923 --> 00:02:05,809
When one is in town,
one amuses oneself.

10
00:02:05,907 --> 00:02:07,881
When one is in the country,
one amuses other people.

11
00:02:07,987 --> 00:02:09,873
And who are the people you amuse?

12
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:12,042
Oh, neighbors, neighbors.

13
00:02:12,146 --> 00:02:14,730
Got nice neighbors
in your part of Shropshire?

14
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:17,734
Perfectly horrid.
Never speak to them.

15
00:02:17,841 --> 00:02:20,174
How immensely
you must amuse them.

16
00:02:20,272 --> 00:02:24,907
- Shropshire is your county, is it not?
- Shropshire? Yes, of course.

17
00:02:25,007 --> 00:02:28,235
By the way,
Gwendolen is in town, isn't she?

18
00:02:28,334 --> 00:02:31,366
She is. In fact, she's having tea
with me this afternoon.

19
00:02:32,429 --> 00:02:36,224
- How perfectly delightful.
- And so is Aunt Augusta.

20
00:02:37,388 --> 00:02:39,526
Oh.

21
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:42,343
You know, the way
you flirt with Gwendolen...

22
00:02:42,443 --> 00:02:44,897
is almost as bad as the way
Gwendolen flirts with you.

23
00:02:45,002 --> 00:02:47,554
I am in love with Gwendolen.

24
00:02:47,658 --> 00:02:50,275
I have come up to town
expressly to propose to her.

25
00:02:50,377 --> 00:02:53,637
I thought you had come up on pleasure.
I call that business.

26
00:02:53,736 --> 00:02:56,102
How utterly unromantic you are.

27
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:58,532
I really don't see anything
romantic in proposing.

28
00:02:58,631 --> 00:03:00,517
It's very romantic to be in love,

29
00:03:00,615 --> 00:03:02,719
but there's nothing romantic
about a definite proposal.

30
00:03:02,822 --> 00:03:04,643
Why, one may be accepted.

31
00:03:04,742 --> 00:03:07,294
One usually is, I believe,
and then the whole excitement is over.

32
00:03:07,398 --> 00:03:10,212
The very essence of romance
is uncertainty.

33
00:03:10,309 --> 00:03:13,472
If ever I get married, I shall
certainly try and forget the fact.

34
00:03:13,572 --> 00:03:15,458
I have no doubt about that,
my dear Algy.

35
00:03:15,555 --> 00:03:18,303
The divorce court was specially
invented for people like you.

36
00:03:19,554 --> 00:03:22,902
Divorces are made in heaven.
Marriages are...

37
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:25,376
Yes, Algy?

38
00:03:26,785 --> 00:03:29,751
Oh, well, there's no use
my speculating on that subject.

39
00:03:29,856 --> 00:03:32,921
Or, indeed, your speculating
on marrying Gwendolen.

40
00:03:33,023 --> 00:03:34,909
Why on earth do you say that?

41
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:37,145
In the first place, girls never marry
the men they flirt with.

42
00:03:37,247 --> 00:03:40,890
- Ah! That is nonsense.
- It isn't. It's a great truth.

43
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:44,404
It accounts for the extraordinary number
of bachelors that one sees
all over the place.

44
00:03:44,509 --> 00:03:46,842
Second place,
I don't give my consent.

45
00:03:46,941 --> 00:03:49,274
Your consent?

46
00:03:49,372 --> 00:03:51,705
My dear fellow,
Gwendolen is my first cousin,

47
00:03:51,804 --> 00:03:53,690
and before I allow you to marry her,

48
00:03:53,787 --> 00:03:56,306
you will have to clear up
the whole question of Cecily.

49
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,685
Cecily? What on earth
do you mean?

50
00:04:00,794 --> 00:04:02,932
What you mean, Algy,
by "Cecily"?

51
00:04:03,033 --> 00:04:05,814
I don't know anyone
of the name of Cecily.

52
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:09,555
Do you mean to say that you've had
my cigarette case all this time?
I wish you'd let me know.

53
00:04:09,655 --> 00:04:12,174
I've been writing frantic letters
to Scotland Yard about it.

54
00:04:12,278 --> 00:04:14,099
I was very nearly offering
a large reward.

55
00:04:14,198 --> 00:04:17,361
I wish you would offer one. I happen
to be more than usually hard up.

56
00:04:17,462 --> 00:04:20,276
It's no good offering a large reward
now that the thing is found.

57
00:04:20,373 --> 00:04:23,089
I think that's rather mean of you,
Ernest, I must say.

58
00:04:23,188 --> 00:04:25,074
However, it makes no matter,

59
00:04:25,172 --> 00:04:29,393
for now that I look at the inscription,
I find that the thing isn't yours after all.

60
00:04:29,491 --> 00:04:32,173
Well, of course it's mine!
You've seen me with it a hundred times.

61
00:04:32,275 --> 00:04:34,641
You have no right whatsoever
to read what is written inside.

62
00:04:34,738 --> 00:04:37,835
It is a very ungentlemanly thing
to read a private cigarette case.

63
00:04:37,937 --> 00:04:41,613
It's absurd to have a hard-and-fast rule
about what one should
and shouldn't read.

64
00:04:41,713 --> 00:04:43,916
More than half of modern culture
depends on what one shouldn't read.

65
00:04:44,016 --> 00:04:46,884
I'm quite aware of the fact,
and I don't propose
to discuss modern culture with you.

66
00:04:46,991 --> 00:04:49,226
It isn't the sort of thing
one should talk of in private.

67
00:04:49,327 --> 00:04:51,781
- I simply want my cigarette case back.
- Yes!

68
00:04:51,886 --> 00:04:54,219
But this isn't your cigarette case.

69
00:04:54,317 --> 00:04:57,283
This cigarette case is a present
from someone of the name of Cecily.

70
00:04:57,388 --> 00:05:00,136
You said that you didn't know
anyone of that name.

71
00:05:00,236 --> 00:05:03,496
- Well, if you want to know,
- Hmm.

72
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:06,049
Cecily happens to be my aunt.

73
00:05:08,906 --> 00:05:10,727
- Your aunt?
- Yes.

74
00:05:10,825 --> 00:05:13,759
Charming old lady she is too.
Lives at Tunbridge Wells.

75
00:05:15,049 --> 00:05:16,935
But why does she call herself Cecily...

76
00:05:17,032 --> 00:05:20,609
if she's your aunt
and lives in Tunbridge Wells?

77
00:05:20,712 --> 00:05:23,428
"From little Cecily,
with her fondest love."

78
00:05:23,527 --> 00:05:26,973
Well, well, my dear fellow,
what on earth is there in that?

79
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:29,249
Some aunts are tall.
Some aunts are not tall.

80
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:32,382
That is surely a matter that an aunt
may be allowed to decide for herself.

81
00:05:32,485 --> 00:05:34,371
For heaven's sake,
give me my cigarette case.

82
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:37,849
Yes, but why does your aunt
call you her uncle?

83
00:05:37,955 --> 00:05:41,728
"From little Cecily, with her fondest
love, to her dear Uncle Jack."

84
00:05:41,827 --> 00:05:44,859
There's no objection, I admit,
to an aunt being a small aunt,

85
00:05:44,963 --> 00:05:46,969
but why an aunt, no matter
what her size may be,

86
00:05:47,074 --> 00:05:50,455
should call her own nephew her uncle
I can't quite make out.

87
00:05:50,561 --> 00:05:53,243
Besides, your name isn’t Jack at all.
It is Ernest.

88
00:05:53,345 --> 00:05:55,799
It isn't Ernest. It's Jack.

89
00:05:55,904 --> 00:05:58,620
You have always told me
it was Ernest.

90
00:05:58,719 --> 00:06:01,500
You are the most earnest-looking person
I ever saw in my life.

91
00:06:01,598 --> 00:06:03,670
It's absolutely absurd
you saying your name isn't Ernest.

92
00:06:03,774 --> 00:06:05,628
Why, it's on your cards.
Here is one of them.

93
00:06:05,726 --> 00:06:08,310
"Mr. Ernest Worthing,
B4, The Albany."

94
00:06:08,413 --> 00:06:10,648
I shall keep this as a proof
that your name is Ernest...

95
00:06:10,748 --> 00:06:13,813
if ever you attempt to deny the fact
to me, to Gwendolen or to anyone else.

96
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:17,263
Well, my name is Ernest in town
and Jack in the country,

97
00:06:17,371 --> 00:06:19,257
and the cigarette case
was given me in the country.

98
00:06:19,355 --> 00:06:21,688
Yes, but that doesn't account for
the fact that your small Aunt Cecily,

99
00:06:21,786 --> 00:06:24,687
who lives in Tunbridge Wells,
calls you her dear uncle.

100
00:06:24,793 --> 00:06:27,126
Come on, old boy, much better
have the thing out at once.

101
00:06:27,225 --> 00:06:29,777
My dear Algy,
you talk exactly like a dentist.

102
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,076
I may mention that
I have always suspected,

103
00:06:34,071 --> 00:06:35,892
and now I am quite sure,

104
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:38,858
that you are a confirmed
and secret Bunburyist.

105
00:06:38,967 --> 00:06:40,853
Bunburyist?

106
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:44,434
What on earth do you mean
by Bunburyist?

107
00:06:45,621 --> 00:06:48,686
I will reveal to you the meaning
of that incomparable expression...

108
00:06:48,788 --> 00:06:50,609
when you are kind enough
to tell me...

109
00:06:50,707 --> 00:06:53,259
why you are Ernest in town
and Jack in the country.

110
00:06:54,642 --> 00:06:57,641
- Well, produce my cigarette case first.
- There it is.

111
00:06:58,898 --> 00:07:01,002
Now produce your explanation,

112
00:07:01,105 --> 00:07:03,559
and pray make it improbable.

113
00:07:03,665 --> 00:07:05,966
There's nothing improbable
about my explanation at all.

114
00:07:06,064 --> 00:07:09,707
Old Mr. Thomas Cardew, who
adopted me when I was a little boy,

115
00:07:09,807 --> 00:07:12,075
made me, in his will,
guardian to his granddaughter,

116
00:07:12,175 --> 00:07:14,596
Miss Cecily Cardew.

117
00:07:14,702 --> 00:07:18,116
Cecily, who addresses me as uncle
out of motives of respect,

118
00:07:18,221 --> 00:07:20,042
which you could not possibly
appreciate,

119
00:07:20,141 --> 00:07:23,304
lives at my place in the country under
the charge of her admirable governess,

120
00:07:23,404 --> 00:07:25,225
Miss Prism.

121
00:07:25,324 --> 00:07:28,170
Where is that place
in the country, by the way?

122
00:07:28,268 --> 00:07:31,780
That is nothing to you, dear boy.
You are not going to be invited.

123
00:07:31,882 --> 00:07:35,328
I may tell you candidly
that it is not in Shropshire.

124
00:07:35,434 --> 00:07:37,255
I suspected that.

125
00:07:37,353 --> 00:07:40,581
I have Bunburyed all over Shropshire
on two separate occasions. Well, go on.

126
00:07:41,896 --> 00:07:43,717
When one is placed
in the position of guardian,

127
00:07:43,816 --> 00:07:48,124
one has to adopt a very high
moral tone on all subjects.

128
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,051
It is one's duty to do so.

129
00:07:51,046 --> 00:07:53,630
And as a high moral tone can hardly
be said to conduce very much...

130
00:07:53,733 --> 00:07:55,837
to either one's health
or one's happiness,

131
00:07:55,941 --> 00:07:57,882
in order to get up to town,
I have always pretended...

132
00:07:57,988 --> 00:08:00,289
to have a younger brother
of the name of Ernest,

133
00:08:00,388 --> 00:08:04,380
who lives here in the Albany and who
gets into the most dreadful scrapes.

134
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:06,686
- That, my dear Algy, is the whole truth.
- Oh, no.

135
00:08:06,787 --> 00:08:09,819
What you really are is a Bunburyist.

136
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:12,223
I was perfectly right in saying
you were a Bunburyist.

137
00:08:12,321 --> 00:08:14,491
You one are of the most advanced
Bunburyists I know.

138
00:08:14,592 --> 00:08:16,413
What on earth do you mean?

139
00:08:16,512 --> 00:08:19,031
You have invented a very useful
younger brother called Ernest...

140
00:08:19,136 --> 00:08:21,982
in order that you may be able to come
up to London as often as you like.

141
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:26,420
I have invented an invaluable
permanent invalid called Bunbury...

142
00:08:26,526 --> 00:08:29,786
in order that I may be able to go down
to the country whenever I choose.

143
00:08:29,886 --> 00:08:32,089
Bunbury really is invaluable.

144
00:08:32,189 --> 00:08:35,003
It if wasn't for Bunbury's extraordinary
bad health, for instance,

145
00:08:35,101 --> 00:08:37,402
I wouldn't be able to dine
with you at Willis' tonight,

146
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,565
for I have really been engaged to dine
at Aunt Augusta's for more than a week.

147
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:42,739
I haven't asked you to dine
with me anywhere tonight.

148
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:46,518
I know. You are absurdly careless
about sending out invitations.

149
00:08:46,618 --> 00:08:48,439
It's very foolish of you.

150
00:08:48,538 --> 00:08:50,806
Nothing annoys people more
than not receiving invitations.

151
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,686
- Algy!

152
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,571
Seton!

153
00:09:05,781 --> 00:09:07,602
Sir?

154
00:09:07,701 --> 00:09:12,304
Seton, I shall require a fresh gardenia
this afternoon at 4:00 precisely.

155
00:09:12,404 --> 00:09:14,443
- Very good, sir.

156
00:09:29,552 --> 00:09:31,461
Ethel, come here!

157
00:09:37,935 --> 00:09:39,789
Thank you, governor.

158
00:09:39,886 --> 00:09:42,056
Giddap now!

159
00:09:54,955 --> 00:09:56,776
Did you hear
what I was singing, Lane?

160
00:09:56,874 --> 00:09:58,760
I didn't think it polite
to listen, sir.

161
00:09:58,857 --> 00:10:00,678
Sorry about that, for your sake.

162
00:10:00,777 --> 00:10:03,394
I don't sing in tune...
anybody can sing in tune...

163
00:10:03,497 --> 00:10:05,318
but I sing with wonderful feeling.

164
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:07,008
Yes, sir.

165
00:10:07,112 --> 00:10:09,184
You have got the cucumber sandwiches
for Lady Bracknell?

166
00:10:09,287 --> 00:10:11,806
- Yes, sir.
- Ah!

167
00:10:14,438 --> 00:10:16,673
- Excuse me, sir.

168
00:10:20,901 --> 00:10:24,161
- Have Lady Bracknell
and Miss Fairfax arrived yet, Lane?
- No, sir.

169
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:28,731
- Mr. Ernest Worthing.
- Jack! I don't seem to remember
inviting you.

170
00:10:28,835 --> 00:10:32,314
No, you're absurdly careless
about sending out invitations.

171
00:10:32,418 --> 00:10:35,515
Cucumber sandwiches? Why such
reckless extravagance in one so young?

172
00:10:35,618 --> 00:10:38,006
Don't you touch them! They're ordered
specially for Aunt Augusta.

173
00:10:38,112 --> 00:10:41,907
- Well, you're eating them.
- That's quite a different matter.
She's my aunt.

174
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,837
Have some bread and butter.

175
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:45,844
The bread and butter
is for Gwendolen.

176
00:10:47,135 --> 00:10:50,265
Gwendolen is devoted
to bread and butter.

177
00:10:50,366 --> 00:10:52,787
And very good bread and butter
it is too.

178
00:10:52,894 --> 00:10:55,610
My dear fellow, you needn't eat it
as if you were going to eat it all.

179
00:10:55,709 --> 00:10:57,977
You behave exactly as if
you were married to her already.

180
00:10:58,076 --> 00:11:00,857
You are not married to her already,
and I don't think you ever will be.

181
00:11:00,956 --> 00:11:02,810
- Now, Algy...

182
00:11:02,908 --> 00:11:04,729
That must be Aunt Augusta.

183
00:11:04,827 --> 00:11:07,728
Only relatives or creditors
ever ring in that Wagnerian manner.

184
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,720
If I can get her out of the way
for ten minutes...

185
00:11:09,818 --> 00:11:12,337
in order that you may have the
opportunity for proposing to Gwendolen,

186
00:11:12,441 --> 00:11:14,895
may I dine with you
at Willis' tonight?

187
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,901
- I suppose so, if you want to.
- But you must be serious about it.

188
00:11:18,008 --> 00:11:19,917
I hate people who are not serious
about meals.

189
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:28,204
Lady Bracknell and Miss Fairfax.

190
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:30,448
Good afternoon, dear Algernon.

191
00:11:30,549 --> 00:11:33,003
I hope you're behaving very well.

192
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:36,850
- I'm feeling very well, Aunt Augusta.
- Yes, that's not quite the same thing.

193
00:11:36,948 --> 00:11:39,914
In fact, the two things
rarely go together.

194
00:11:41,171 --> 00:11:45,032
Oh. How do you do,
Mr. Worthing.

195
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:49,163
- Dear me, Gwendolen, you are smart.
- I am always smart.

196
00:11:49,265 --> 00:11:53,224
- Aren't I, Mr. Worthing?
- You are quite perfect, Miss Fairfax.

197
00:11:53,328 --> 00:11:55,815
Oh, I hope I am not that.

198
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:58,438
It would leave no room
for development,

199
00:11:58,543 --> 00:12:01,738
and I intend to develop
in many directions.

200
00:12:01,838 --> 00:12:03,812
Gwendolen?

201
00:12:03,918 --> 00:12:06,121
Won't you come
and sit here, Gwendolen?

202
00:12:06,221 --> 00:12:09,994
Thank you, Mama.
I am quite comfortable where I am.

203
00:12:10,988 --> 00:12:13,769
I'm sorry if we are
a little late, Algernon.

204
00:12:13,868 --> 00:12:16,714
I was obliged to call
on dear Lady Harbury.

205
00:12:16,811 --> 00:12:19,908
I hadn't been there
since her poor husband's death.

206
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:22,343
I never saw a woman so altered.

207
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:25,572
She looks quite 20 years younger.

208
00:12:25,673 --> 00:12:27,494
And now I'll have a cup of tea...

209
00:12:27,592 --> 00:12:30,940
and one of those nice cucumber
sandwiches you promised me.

210
00:12:31,048 --> 00:12:32,869
Certainly, Aunt Augusta.

211
00:12:36,199 --> 00:12:39,264
Good heavens, Lane!
Why are there no cucumber sandwiches?

212
00:12:39,366 --> 00:12:41,187
I ordered them specially.

213
00:12:41,285 --> 00:12:45,212
There were no cucumbers in the market
this morning, sir. I went down twice.

214
00:12:45,316 --> 00:12:47,137
No cucumbers?

215
00:12:47,236 --> 00:12:49,723
No, sir.
Not even for ready money.

216
00:12:49,828 --> 00:12:51,649
Thank you, Lane.
That will do.

217
00:12:51,747 --> 00:12:53,568
I'm greatly distressed,
Aunt Augusta,

218
00:12:53,667 --> 00:12:55,771
about there being no cucumbers,
not even for ready money.

219
00:12:55,874 --> 00:12:58,262
Well, it really makes no matter,
Algernon.

220
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:00,987
I had some crumpets
with Lady Harbury,

221
00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:04,284
who seems to me to be living
entirely for pleasure now.

222
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:07,132
I hear her hair has turned
quite gold from grief.

223
00:13:07,231 --> 00:13:10,012
Well, it certainly
has changed its color.

224
00:13:10,111 --> 00:13:13,045
From what cause,
I, of course, cannot say.

225
00:13:14,366 --> 00:13:16,187
Uh, forgive me, Aunt Augusta,
but I'm afraid...

226
00:13:16,285 --> 00:13:18,357
I shall have to give up the pleasure
of dining with you tonight.

227
00:13:18,461 --> 00:13:22,518
Oh, I hope not, Algernon.
'Twould put my table completely out.

228
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,204
Well, the fact is, I have just had
a telegram to say...

229
00:13:25,308 --> 00:13:29,169
that my poor friend Bunbury
is very ill again.

230
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:30,965
They think I should be with him.

231
00:13:31,067 --> 00:13:33,521
Well, I must say,
I should be much obliged...

232
00:13:33,626 --> 00:13:36,527
if you would ask
Mr. Bunbury from me...

233
00:13:36,633 --> 00:13:39,665
not to have a relapse on Saturday,

234
00:13:39,768 --> 00:13:42,865
for I rely on you to arrange
my music for me.

235
00:13:42,968 --> 00:13:45,869
It is my last reception,
and one wants something...

236
00:13:45,975 --> 00:13:48,243
that will encourage conversation,

237
00:13:48,343 --> 00:13:50,481
particularly at the end
of the season,

238
00:13:50,582 --> 00:13:54,094
when everybody has practically said
whatever they had to say,

239
00:13:54,197 --> 00:13:57,043
which, in most cases,
was probably not much.

240
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:00,816
I will speak to Bunbury,
Aunt Augusta, if he is still conscious,

241
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:04,176
and I think I can promise you
that he will be all right by Saturday.

242
00:14:04,275 --> 00:14:07,852
Of course, the music is
a great difficulty,

243
00:14:07,954 --> 00:14:09,993
but I will run over the program
I've worked out...

244
00:14:10,098 --> 00:14:11,919
if you'll come into the other room.

245
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,504
Thank you, Algernon.
That's very thoughtful of you.

246
00:14:14,609 --> 00:14:17,259
I'm sure the program
will be delightful...

247
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,076
after a few expurgations.

248
00:14:20,175 --> 00:14:22,989
French songs
I cannot possibly allow.

249
00:14:23,087 --> 00:14:25,639
People always seem to think
they're improper...

250
00:14:25,742 --> 00:14:28,229
and either look shocked,
which is vulgar,

251
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:30,722
or laugh, which is worse.

252
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:34,405
Now, German sounds a thoroughly
respectable language,

253
00:14:34,508 --> 00:14:37,638
and, indeed, I believe, is so.

254
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,324
Gwendolen, you will accompany me.

255
00:14:40,426 --> 00:14:42,465
Certainly, Mama.

256
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:48,712
Well, here is the program
I suggest, Aunt Augusta.

257
00:14:48,809 --> 00:14:51,142
Charming day it has been,
Miss Fairfax.

258
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,948
Pray don't talk to me
about the weather, Mr. Worthing.

259
00:14:55,047 --> 00:14:56,901
Whenever people talk to me
about the weather,

260
00:14:56,999 --> 00:14:59,998
I always feel quite certain
they mean something else,

261
00:15:00,102 --> 00:15:01,923
and that makes me so nervous.

262
00:15:02,022 --> 00:15:04,094
I do mean something else.

263
00:15:04,198 --> 00:15:07,012
I thought so.
In fact, I'm never wrong.

264
00:15:07,109 --> 00:15:10,141
I would like to be allowed to take
advantage of Lady Bracknell's
temporary absence.

265
00:15:10,244 --> 00:15:12,130
I would certainly advise you
to do so.

266
00:15:12,228 --> 00:15:15,096
Mama has a way of coming back
suddenly into a room...

267
00:15:15,203 --> 00:15:17,569
that I have often had
to speak to her about.

268
00:15:19,394 --> 00:15:23,670
Miss Fairfax, ever since I met you,
I have admired you...

269
00:15:23,777 --> 00:15:28,183
more than any girl I have every met
s-s-since I met you...

270
00:15:28,288 --> 00:15:31,385
Yes, I am quite aware of the fact,

271
00:15:31,488 --> 00:15:35,764
and I often wish that, in public at any
rate, you would be more demonstrative.

272
00:15:35,871 --> 00:15:39,993
For me you have always had
an irresistible fascination.

273
00:15:40,093 --> 00:15:43,158
Even before I met you,
I was far from indifferent to you.

274
00:15:43,261 --> 00:15:46,107
We live, as I hope you know,
Mr. Worthing,

275
00:15:46,204 --> 00:15:48,788
in an age of ideals,

276
00:15:48,891 --> 00:15:52,883
and my ideal has always been
to love someone of the name of Ernest.

277
00:15:52,987 --> 00:15:56,663
There is something in that name
which inspires absolute confidence.

278
00:15:56,761 --> 00:16:01,462
The moment Algernon first mentioned
to me he had a friend called Ernest,

279
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,446
I knew I was destined to love you.

280
00:16:04,888 --> 00:16:06,742
But you...

281
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,548
You really love me,
Gwendolen?

282
00:16:10,646 --> 00:16:12,750
Passionately.

283
00:16:12,854 --> 00:16:14,675
Darling, it...

284
00:16:15,861 --> 00:16:17,682
You don't know how happy
you've made me.

285
00:16:17,781 --> 00:16:20,431
My own Ernest!

286
00:16:20,533 --> 00:16:24,209
But you don't mean to say you couldn't
love me if my name wasn't Ernest?

287
00:16:24,308 --> 00:16:26,194
But your name is Ernest.

288
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,875
Yes, I know it is, but...
but supposing it wasn't?

289
00:16:28,979 --> 00:16:31,825
Supposing it was something else?

290
00:16:31,922 --> 00:16:33,896
Do you mean to say
you couldn't love me then?

291
00:16:34,001 --> 00:16:37,033
Ah, this is clearly
a metaphysical speculation,

292
00:16:37,137 --> 00:16:38,958
and, like most metaphysical
speculations,

293
00:16:39,056 --> 00:16:40,877
has very little reference at all...

294
00:16:40,976 --> 00:16:42,950
to the actual facts
of real life as we know them.

295
00:16:43,056 --> 00:16:45,837
Well, personally, darling,
to speak candidly,

296
00:16:45,935 --> 00:16:48,781
I don't much care
for the name of Ernest.

297
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:50,765
I really don't think
it suits me at all.

298
00:16:50,861 --> 00:16:54,024
It suits you perfectly.
It's a divine name.

299
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:56,229
It has music of its own.

300
00:16:56,332 --> 00:16:59,014
It... It produces vibrations.

301
00:17:00,011 --> 00:17:01,865
Well, I must say, Gwendolen,

302
00:17:01,964 --> 00:17:04,810
I think there are lots
of other much nicer names.

303
00:17:04,906 --> 00:17:09,095
I think, um, Jack, for instance,
a charming name.

304
00:17:09,193 --> 00:17:12,039
Jack? Oh, no.

305
00:17:12,137 --> 00:17:15,551
There's very little music in the name
of Jack, if any at all, indeed.

306
00:17:15,657 --> 00:17:17,827
I have known several Jacks,

307
00:17:17,928 --> 00:17:20,993
and they all, without exception,
were more than usually plain.

308
00:17:21,095 --> 00:17:24,738
Besides, Jack is a notorious
domesticity for "John,"

309
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:28,098
and I pity any woman
who is married to a man called John.

310
00:17:29,094 --> 00:17:33,500
No, the only really safe name
is Ernest.

311
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:37,340
Gwendolen, I...
I must get christened at once.

312
00:17:37,443 --> 00:17:39,897
I mean, we must
get married at once.

313
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:42,880
Married, Mr. Worthing?

314
00:17:43,874 --> 00:17:45,695
Well, surely.

315
00:17:45,794 --> 00:17:48,859
You know that I love you, and you have
led me to believe, Miss Fairfax,

316
00:17:48,961 --> 00:17:51,033
that you are not
entirely indifferent to me.

317
00:17:52,032 --> 00:17:54,780
I adore you, but you haven't
proposed to me yet.

318
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:58,458
Well,
May I propose to you now?

319
00:17:59,582 --> 00:18:02,199
I think it would be
an admirable opportunity.

320
00:18:03,453 --> 00:18:06,648
And to spare you any possible
disappointment, Mr. Worthing,

321
00:18:06,749 --> 00:18:10,043
I think it only fair to tell you
quite frankly beforehand...

322
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,278
that I'm fully determined
to accept you.

323
00:18:13,563 --> 00:18:15,667
Gwendolen.

324
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:20,528
Yes, Mr. Worthing?
What have you got to say to me?

325
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:23,217
Well, you know
what I've got to say to you.

326
00:18:23,321 --> 00:18:26,102
Yes, but you don't say it.

327
00:18:37,878 --> 00:18:41,138
Gwendolen, will you marry me?

328
00:18:41,237 --> 00:18:43,058
Of course I will, darling.

329
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:45,544
How long you've been about it!

330
00:18:45,652 --> 00:18:48,269
I'm afraid you've had
very little practice in how to propose.

331
00:18:48,371 --> 00:18:51,305
My own one, I've never loved
anyone in the world but you.

332
00:18:51,411 --> 00:18:55,152
Yes, but men often propose
for practice.

333
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:58,445
I know my brother does.
All my girlfriends tell me so.

334
00:18:59,441 --> 00:19:02,604
What wonderfully blue eyes
you have, Ernest.

335
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,348
They're quite, quite blue.

336
00:19:07,344 --> 00:19:09,677
I hope you will always
look at me just like that,

337
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:12,424
especially when there are
other people present.

338
00:19:16,365 --> 00:19:18,088
Mr. Worthing.

339
00:19:18,189 --> 00:19:22,628
Rise, sir, from this
semirecumbent posture.

340
00:19:22,732 --> 00:19:24,586
It is most indecorous.

341
00:19:24,683 --> 00:19:29,635
Mama, I must beg you to retire.
This is no place for you.

342
00:19:30,635 --> 00:19:34,179
Besides, Mr. Worthing has not
quite finished yet.

343
00:19:34,281 --> 00:19:37,924
Finished what, may I ask?

344
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,112
I am engaged to Mr. Worthing, Mama.

345
00:19:42,215 --> 00:19:44,636
Pardon me?
You are not engaged to anyone.

346
00:19:44,743 --> 00:19:47,557
When you do become
engaged to someone,

347
00:19:47,655 --> 00:19:50,207
I or your father,
should his health permit him,

348
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:52,643
will inform you of the fact.

349
00:19:52,741 --> 00:19:56,089
An engagement should come
upon a young girl as a surprise,

350
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:59,195
pleasant or unpleasant
as the case may be.

351
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:03,128
'Tis hardly a matter that she could
be allowed to arrange for herself.

352
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:06,911
And now I have a few questions
to put to you, Mr. Worthing.

353
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:09,726
While I am making these inquiries,

354
00:20:09,826 --> 00:20:14,047
you, Gwendolen, will wait for me
below in the carriage.

355
00:20:14,144 --> 00:20:18,779
- Mama.
- In the carriage, Gwendolen.

356
00:20:36,411 --> 00:20:39,857
Gwendolen, the carriage.

357
00:20:39,963 --> 00:20:41,872
Yes, Mama.

358
00:20:43,802 --> 00:20:45,906
You can take a seat,
Mr. Worthing.

359
00:20:46,009 --> 00:20:49,041
Thank you, Lady Bracknell.
I prefer standing.

360
00:20:49,144 --> 00:20:51,030
I feel bound to tell you...

361
00:20:51,128 --> 00:20:53,516
that you are not down on my list
of eligible young men,

362
00:20:53,624 --> 00:20:57,551
though I have the same list
as the dear Duchess of Bolton has.

363
00:20:57,655 --> 00:20:59,858
We work together, in fact.

364
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,510
But I am quite ready
to enter your name,

365
00:21:02,614 --> 00:21:06,290
should your answers be what
a really affectionate mother requires.

366
00:21:06,389 --> 00:21:08,079
Do you smoke?

367
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,961
Well, yes, I must admit I smoke.

368
00:21:11,059 --> 00:21:12,945
I'm glad to hear it.

369
00:21:13,043 --> 00:21:15,311
A man should have
an occupation of some kind.

370
00:21:16,307 --> 00:21:20,713
I have always been of opinion
that a man who desires to get married...

371
00:21:20,817 --> 00:21:24,132
should either know everything
or nothing.

372
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:27,339
Which do you know?

373
00:21:29,424 --> 00:21:32,772
- I know nothing, Lady Bracknell.
- I am pleased to hear it.

374
00:21:32,879 --> 00:21:37,220
I do not approve of anything
that tampers with natural ignorance.

375
00:21:38,222 --> 00:21:41,570
Ignorance is like
a delicate exotic fruit:

376
00:21:41,677 --> 00:21:44,098
Touch it and the bloom is gone.

377
00:21:44,204 --> 00:21:48,261
The whole theory of modern education
is radically unsound.

378
00:21:48,363 --> 00:21:52,868
Fortunately, in England at any rate,
education produces no effect whatsoever.

379
00:21:52,971 --> 00:21:55,555
What is your income?

380
00:21:55,658 --> 00:21:57,730
Between 7,000 and 8,000 a year.

381
00:21:57,834 --> 00:22:00,200
In land or in investments?

382
00:22:00,297 --> 00:22:03,492
- In investments, chiefly.
- That is satisfactory.

383
00:22:03,592 --> 00:22:07,071
What between the duties expected
of one during one's lifetime...

384
00:22:07,176 --> 00:22:10,404
and the duties exacted from one
after one's death,

385
00:22:10,503 --> 00:22:13,982
land has ceased to be
either a profit or a pleasure.

386
00:22:14,086 --> 00:22:17,500
It gives one position
but prevents one from keeping it up.

387
00:22:17,605 --> 00:22:20,092
That's all that can be said
about land.

388
00:22:20,196 --> 00:22:23,130
I have a country house with some land,
of course, attached to it.

389
00:22:23,236 --> 00:22:25,569
About 1,500 acres, I believe,

390
00:22:25,668 --> 00:22:27,806
but I don't depend on that
for my real income.

391
00:22:27,906 --> 00:22:30,393
In fact, as far as I can make out,

392
00:22:30,498 --> 00:22:33,115
the poachers are the only people
who make anything out of it.

393
00:22:36,449 --> 00:22:38,652
You have a town house, I hope.

394
00:22:38,753 --> 00:22:42,068
A girl with a simple, unspoiled
nature like Gwendolen...

395
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:44,924
can hardly be expected
to reside in the country.

396
00:22:45,022 --> 00:22:47,890
Well, I own a house
in Belgrave Square,

397
00:22:47,998 --> 00:22:49,819
but it is let by the year
to Lady Bloxham.

398
00:22:49,917 --> 00:22:52,087
Lady Bloxham?

399
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:54,011
No, I don't know her.

400
00:22:54,109 --> 00:22:56,050
Oh, she goes about very little.

401
00:22:56,156 --> 00:22:58,675
She's a lady considerably
advanced in years.

402
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:01,648
Ah, nowadays that is no guarantee...

403
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:05,136
of respectability of character.

404
00:23:05,242 --> 00:23:07,063
What are your politics?

405
00:23:07,162 --> 00:23:09,878
Well, I am afraid
I really have none.

406
00:23:09,977 --> 00:23:12,398
I am a liberal.

407
00:23:12,504 --> 00:23:15,023
Oh, they count as Tories.

408
00:23:15,128 --> 00:23:18,542
They dine with us
or come in the evening, at any rate.

409
00:23:19,543 --> 00:23:22,989
Now to minor matters.

410
00:23:23,095 --> 00:23:25,330
Are your parents living?

411
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:30,576
I have lost both my parents.

412
00:23:30,677 --> 00:23:35,825
To lose one parent, Mr. Worthing,
may be regarded as a misfortune.

413
00:23:35,924 --> 00:23:39,087
To lose both
looks like carelessness.

414
00:23:39,187 --> 00:23:41,674
Who was your father?

415
00:23:42,674 --> 00:23:45,291
Well, I'm afraid I really don't know.

416
00:23:45,393 --> 00:23:48,261
The fact is, Lady Bracknell,
I said I had lost both my parents.

417
00:23:48,368 --> 00:23:52,229
It would be nearer the truth
to say my parents seem to have lost me.

418
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,628
I don't actually know
who I am by birth.

419
00:23:55,727 --> 00:23:57,548
I was...

420
00:23:58,607 --> 00:24:00,548
Well, I was found.

421
00:24:01,805 --> 00:24:03,714
Found?

422
00:24:03,821 --> 00:24:06,122
The late Mr. Thomas Cardew,

423
00:24:06,221 --> 00:24:08,969
an old gentleman of most charitable
and kindly disposition,

424
00:24:09,068 --> 00:24:11,522
found me and gave me
the name of Worthing...

425
00:24:11,628 --> 00:24:14,147
because he happened to have
a first-class ticket for Worthing...

426
00:24:14,251 --> 00:24:16,323
in his pocket at the time.

427
00:24:16,426 --> 00:24:20,221
Worthing is a place in Sussex.
It is a seaside resort.

428
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:23,395
And where did
the charitable gentleman...

429
00:24:23,497 --> 00:24:26,943
who had a first-class ticket
for this seaside resort...

430
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,869
find you?

431
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:31,940
In a handbag.

432
00:24:32,935 --> 00:24:35,389
A handbag?

433
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:39,233
Yes, Lady Bracknell,
I was in a handbag.

434
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:44,187
A somewhat large
black leather handbag...

435
00:24:44,292 --> 00:24:46,113
with handles to it.

436
00:24:46,211 --> 00:24:48,032
An ordinary handbag, in fact.

437
00:24:48,131 --> 00:24:50,552
In what locality...

438
00:24:50,658 --> 00:24:54,780
did this Mr. James
or Thomas Cardew...

439
00:24:54,882 --> 00:24:58,230
come across this ordinary handbag?

440
00:24:59,425 --> 00:25:02,773
In the cloakroom at Victoria Station.
It was given him in mistake for his own.

441
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,945
The cloakroom
at Victoria Station?

442
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:08,796
Yes, the Brighton line.

443
00:25:08,894 --> 00:25:11,893
The line is immaterial.

444
00:25:15,005 --> 00:25:17,371
Mr. Worthing,

445
00:25:18,396 --> 00:25:22,966
I confess I feel somewhat bewildered
by what you have just told me.

446
00:25:23,068 --> 00:25:26,863
To be born or, at any rate, bred
in a handbag,

447
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:29,336
whether it had handles or not,

448
00:25:29,434 --> 00:25:34,254
seems to me to display contempt for
the ordinary decencies of family life...

449
00:25:34,361 --> 00:25:38,386
that reminds one of the worst
excesses of the French Revolution,

450
00:25:38,488 --> 00:25:42,381
and I presume you know what
that unfortunate movement led to.

451
00:25:42,487 --> 00:25:45,355
Well, may I ask, then,
what you advise me to do?

452
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:47,534
I need hardly say
I would do anything in the world...

453
00:25:47,638 --> 00:25:49,677
to ensure Gwendolen's happiness.

454
00:25:49,782 --> 00:25:52,366
I would strongly advise you,
Mr. Worthing,

455
00:25:52,469 --> 00:25:56,461
to try and acquire some relations
as soon as possible,

456
00:25:56,564 --> 00:25:59,083
and to make a definite effort
to produce...

457
00:25:59,188 --> 00:26:02,318
at any rate one parent
of either sex...

458
00:26:02,419 --> 00:26:05,418
before the season is quite over.

459
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:08,270
Well, I really don't see how I can
possibly do that, Lady Bracknell.

460
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:11,184
I can produce the handbag at any moment.
It's in my dressing room at home.

461
00:26:11,281 --> 00:26:13,647
I really think that ought to satisfy you,
Lady Bracknell.

462
00:26:13,745 --> 00:26:16,591
Me, sir?
What has it to do with me?

463
00:26:16,687 --> 00:26:19,621
You can hardly imagine
that I and Lord Bracknell...

464
00:26:19,727 --> 00:26:22,246
would dream of allowing
our only daughter,

465
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:25,098
a girl brought up
with the utmost care,

466
00:26:25,198 --> 00:26:27,782
to marry into a cloakroom...

467
00:26:27,885 --> 00:26:30,601
and form an alliance
with a parcel!

468
00:26:31,596 --> 00:26:34,083
Good morning, Mr. Worthing.

469
00:26:36,043 --> 00:26:37,897
Good morning, Lady Bracknell.

470
00:26:52,168 --> 00:26:55,069
Algy, for heaven's sake,
stop playing that ghastly tune!

471
00:26:57,158 --> 00:26:59,067
- Didn't it go off all right, old boy?
- Oh.

472
00:26:59,174 --> 00:27:02,206
- Do you mean Gwendolen refused you?
- Oh, Gwendolen is as right as a trivet.

473
00:27:02,309 --> 00:27:04,195
As far as she's concerned,
we're engaged.

474
00:27:04,293 --> 00:27:06,780
Her mother is an absolute gorgon!

475
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:10,561
I don't really know what a gorgon is,
but I'm sure Lady Bracknell is one.

476
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:14,521
In any case, she's a monster without
being a myth, which is rather unfair.

477
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:18,968
Algy, you don't suppose
that Gwendolen...

478
00:27:19,073 --> 00:27:23,195
will become like her mother
in about 150 years, do you?

479
00:27:23,297 --> 00:27:26,263
All women become like their mothers.
That is their tragedy.

480
00:27:26,368 --> 00:27:30,295
- No man does. That's his.
- Is that clever?

481
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,667
It's perfectly phrased
and quite as true...

482
00:27:32,766 --> 00:27:35,547
as any observation
in civilized life should be.

483
00:27:35,646 --> 00:27:37,500
By the way, did you tell
Gwendolen the truth...

484
00:27:37,598 --> 00:27:39,964
about your being Ernest in town
and Jack in the country?

485
00:27:40,061 --> 00:27:43,060
My dear fellow, the truth
is not quite the sort of thing...

486
00:27:43,164 --> 00:27:45,912
one tells to a nice, sweet,
refined girl.

487
00:27:46,012 --> 00:27:49,175
Besides, before the end of the week,
I shall have got rid of Ernest.

488
00:27:49,275 --> 00:27:52,023
My poor brother Ernest
is going to be carried off...

489
00:27:52,122 --> 00:27:56,114
quite suddenly in Paris
by a severe chill.

490
00:27:56,217 --> 00:27:59,249
I thought you said that your ward
was a little too much interested...

491
00:27:59,353 --> 00:28:01,207
in your poor brother Ernest.

492
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:03,125
Won't she feel his loss a good deal?

493
00:28:03,224 --> 00:28:05,590
Oh, Cecily isn't a silly romantic girl,
I'm happy to say.

494
00:28:05,687 --> 00:28:07,825
She's got a capital appetite,
goes for long walks...

495
00:28:07,927 --> 00:28:10,414
and pays no attention at all
to her lessons.

496
00:28:10,518 --> 00:28:12,492
I should rather like to see Cecily.

497
00:28:12,598 --> 00:28:14,964
I shall take very good care
that you never do.

498
00:28:15,061 --> 00:28:17,100
She is excessively pretty
and only just 18.

499
00:28:17,204 --> 00:28:20,269
Have you told Gwendolen
you have an excessively pretty ward
who is only just 18?

500
00:28:20,372 --> 00:28:23,437
Oh, one doesn't blurt
these things out to people.

501
00:28:23,539 --> 00:28:25,993
Cecily and Gwendolen are
certain to be extremely good friends.

502
00:28:26,098 --> 00:28:29,326
I'll bet you that half an hour after
they've met, they'll be calling
each other "sister."

503
00:28:29,426 --> 00:28:31,564
Hmm. Women only do that...

504
00:28:31,665 --> 00:28:33,966
when they've called each other
a lot of other things first.

505
00:28:34,065 --> 00:28:37,893
- Miss Fairfax.

506
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,854
Algy, kindly turn your back.

507
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:42,055
I have something very particular
to say to Mr. Worthing.

508
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,492
Really, Gwendolen, I don't think
I can allow this at all.

509
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,793
- Ernest, we may never be married.
- Huh?

510
00:28:46,894 --> 00:28:49,260
From the expression on Mama's face,
I fear we never shall.

511
00:28:49,358 --> 00:28:52,040
But although she may prevent us
from becoming man and wife,

512
00:28:52,141 --> 00:28:56,166
nothing she can possibly do
can alter my eternal devotion to you.

513
00:28:56,268 --> 00:29:00,041
Your... Your Christian name has
an irresistible fascination.

514
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,408
The simplicity of your character...

515
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:05,321
makes you exquisitely
incomprehensible to me.

516
00:29:05,418 --> 00:29:09,377
Your town address I have.
What is your address in the country?

517
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:11,749
The Manor House,
Woolton, Hertfordshire.

518
00:29:11,849 --> 00:29:13,735
There is a good postal service,
I suppose.

519
00:29:13,832 --> 00:29:16,198
It may be necessary
to do something desperate.

520
00:29:17,191 --> 00:29:20,899
The Manor House, Woolton,

521
00:29:20,999 --> 00:29:22,853
Hertfordshire.

522
00:29:24,006 --> 00:29:26,176
My own one.

523
00:29:30,308 --> 00:29:32,576
- Cecily.
- Yes, Miss Prism?

524
00:29:36,867 --> 00:29:38,688
Oh, dear!

525
00:29:40,706 --> 00:29:42,527
Cecily!

526
00:29:43,585 --> 00:29:46,104
Come here at once, child.

527
00:29:50,784 --> 00:29:53,685
We should have been at our labors
quite 20 minutes ago, Cecily.

528
00:29:53,791 --> 00:29:57,532
Unfortunately, I was detained
by a slight mishap to my, uh, my...

529
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:00,117
Oh, well, never mind about that.

530
00:30:00,222 --> 00:30:02,043
Your German grammar
is on the table.

531
00:30:03,581 --> 00:30:06,427
- Oh.
- But I don't like German.

532
00:30:06,524 --> 00:30:09,621
It isn't at all a becoming language.

533
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:13,203
I know perfectly well that I look
quite plain after my German lesson.

534
00:30:13,307 --> 00:30:15,411
Oh, child, you know how anxious
your guardian is...

535
00:30:15,514 --> 00:30:17,618
that you should improve yourself
in every way.

536
00:30:17,722 --> 00:30:21,812
He laid particular stress on your German
as he was leaving for town yesterday.

537
00:30:21,913 --> 00:30:25,905
Indeed, he always lays stress on your
German when he's leaving for town.

538
00:30:26,008 --> 00:30:29,520
We will repeat yesterday's lesson.
Genders.

539
00:30:29,623 --> 00:30:32,851
Dear Uncle Jack.
He's so very serious.

540
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:36,047
Sometimes he is so serious
that I think he cannot be quite well.

541
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:38,538
Your guardian enjoys
the best of health,

542
00:30:38,646 --> 00:30:41,012
and his gravity of demeanor...

543
00:30:41,109 --> 00:30:43,442
His gravity of demeanor
is especially to be commended...

544
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:46,441
in one so comparatively
young as he is.

545
00:30:46,547 --> 00:30:50,190
I know no one who has a higher sense
of duty and responsibility.

546
00:30:50,291 --> 00:30:53,421
I suppose that is why he often looks a
little bored when we three are together.

547
00:30:53,522 --> 00:30:55,431
Cecily, I'm surprised at you!

548
00:30:55,537 --> 00:30:57,958
Mr. Worthing has
many troubles in his life.

549
00:30:58,065 --> 00:31:02,536
Idle merriment and triviality would be
out of place in his conversation.

550
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,014
You must remember his constant anxiety
about that unfortunate young man,

551
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:09,060
his brother Ernest.

552
00:31:09,166 --> 00:31:11,718
Oh, I... I wish Uncle Jack
would allow...

553
00:31:11,822 --> 00:31:15,170
that unfortunate young man,
his brother Ernest,

554
00:31:15,277 --> 00:31:17,218
- to come down here sometimes.
- Oh, really!

555
00:31:23,403 --> 00:31:25,377
Diminutives are always neuter.

556
00:31:25,482 --> 00:31:27,586
That is, they belong to neither sex,

557
00:31:27,691 --> 00:31:30,592
even when appearances
are to the contrary.

558
00:31:30,698 --> 00:31:34,493
As for example,
das Fräulein, the young lady,

559
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,739
das Mädchen, the young girl.

560
00:31:37,736 --> 00:31:39,808
Put away your diary, Cecily.

561
00:31:39,912 --> 00:31:42,529
I really don't see why
you should keep a diary at all.

562
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:45,348
I keep a diary...

563
00:31:45,446 --> 00:31:48,827
in order to enter
the wonderful secrets of my life.

564
00:31:49,829 --> 00:31:53,210
If I didn't write them down, I should
probably forget all about them.

565
00:31:53,316 --> 00:31:57,537
Memory, my dear Cecily, is the diary
that we all carry about with us.

566
00:31:57,636 --> 00:32:00,537
Yes, but it usually chronicles
the things that have never happened...

567
00:32:00,643 --> 00:32:02,584
and couldn't possibly have happened.

568
00:32:02,691 --> 00:32:04,959
I believe that memory is responsible...

569
00:32:05,058 --> 00:32:07,708
for nearly all the three-volume novels
that the library sends us.

570
00:32:07,809 --> 00:32:10,775
Oh, do not speak slightingly
of the three-volume novel.

571
00:32:10,881 --> 00:32:14,262
I wrote one myself in earlier days.

572
00:32:14,368 --> 00:32:16,756
Did you really, Miss Prism?

573
00:32:16,863 --> 00:32:19,611
Oh, how wonderfully clever you are!

574
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:24,533
I hope it did not end happily.
I don't like novels that end happily.

575
00:32:25,949 --> 00:32:29,177
The good ended happily
and the bad, unhappily.

576
00:32:29,276 --> 00:32:31,162
That is what fiction means.

577
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,812
I suppose so.
And was it ever published?

578
00:32:33,916 --> 00:32:37,973
Alas, no. The manuscript
unfortunately was abandoned.

579
00:32:38,074 --> 00:32:39,895
- Oh!
- Oh, I use the word...

580
00:32:39,994 --> 00:32:42,775
in the sense of lost or mislaid.

581
00:32:42,873 --> 00:32:44,759
Now to your work, child.

582
00:32:44,857 --> 00:32:47,092
These speculations are profitless.

583
00:32:48,088 --> 00:32:51,153
But I see dear Dr. Chasuble
coming up through the garden.

584
00:32:51,255 --> 00:32:53,164
Oh, really?

585
00:32:53,335 --> 00:32:57,741
Ah! And... And how are we
this morning?

586
00:32:57,846 --> 00:33:00,049
Miss Prism, you are, I trust, well?

587
00:33:00,149 --> 00:33:02,384
Dr. Chasuble,
this is indeed a pleasure.

588
00:33:02,485 --> 00:33:04,972
Miss Prism has just been complaining
of a slight headache.

589
00:33:05,077 --> 00:33:07,923
- Oh!
- I think it would do her so much good...

590
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:10,767
to go for a short stroll
with you in the park, Dr. Chasuble.

591
00:33:10,867 --> 00:33:13,517
Cecily, I have not mentioned
anything about a headache.

592
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:15,440
No, I know that, dear Miss Prism,

593
00:33:15,539 --> 00:33:18,091
but I felt instinctively
that you had a headache.

594
00:33:18,194 --> 00:33:20,015
Indeed, I was thinking about that,

595
00:33:20,113 --> 00:33:22,795
and not about my German lesson,
when the rector arrived.

596
00:33:22,897 --> 00:33:25,165
I hope, Cecily,
you are not inattentive.

597
00:33:25,264 --> 00:33:28,558
- Oh, I'm afraid I am.
- That is strange.

598
00:33:28,655 --> 00:33:31,403
Were I fortunate enough
to be Miss Prism's pupil,

599
00:33:31,503 --> 00:33:33,324
I would hang upon her lips.

600
00:33:33,423 --> 00:33:36,073
- Oh!
- I spoke metaphorically.

601
00:33:36,173 --> 00:33:38,506
My metaphor was drawn from bees.

602
00:33:38,605 --> 00:33:41,920
Mr. Worthing, I suppose,
has not returned from town yet.

603
00:33:42,028 --> 00:33:44,198
We do not expect him
till Monday afternoon.

604
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:47,016
Ah, yes, he usually likes
to spend his Sunday in London.

605
00:33:47,116 --> 00:33:50,792
He is not one of those
whose sole aim is enjoyment,

606
00:33:50,891 --> 00:33:54,119
as, by all accounts, that unfortunate
young man, his brother, seems to be.

607
00:33:54,218 --> 00:33:58,526
I must not disturb
Egeria and her pupil any longer.

608
00:33:58,633 --> 00:34:01,796
Egeria? My name is Laetitia,
Doctor.

609
00:34:01,896 --> 00:34:06,750
Ah! Laetitia, the Latin for "joy."

610
00:34:06,855 --> 00:34:08,676
Yes...

611
00:34:08,775 --> 00:34:12,603
I shall, uh, I shall see you both,
no doubt, at evensong.

612
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:15,076
I think, dear Doctor, I will have
a stroll with you.

613
00:34:15,173 --> 00:34:18,968
I find I have a headache after all,
and a stroll might do it good.

614
00:34:19,076 --> 00:34:22,849
Oh, Cecily, you will read your
political economy in my absence.

615
00:34:22,947 --> 00:34:25,531
The chapter on the fall of the rupee
you may omit.

616
00:34:25,635 --> 00:34:27,521
It is somewhat too sensational.

617
00:34:27,618 --> 00:34:30,999
Even these metallic problems
have their melodramatic side.

618
00:34:35,776 --> 00:34:38,775
Horrid political economy,
horrid geology,

619
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,886
horrid, horrid German!

620
00:34:45,438 --> 00:34:48,154
You are too much alone,
dear Dr. Chasuble.

621
00:34:49,437 --> 00:34:53,014
- You should get married.
- Oh, no!

622
00:34:53,116 --> 00:34:55,319
You do not seem to realize,
dear Doctor,

623
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:58,234
that by persistently remaining single,
a man converts himself...

624
00:34:58,332 --> 00:35:00,218
into a permanent public temptation.

625
00:35:00,314 --> 00:35:01,874
Oh!

626
00:35:01,979 --> 00:35:03,800
A man should be more careful...

627
00:35:03,898 --> 00:35:07,312
or he may lead
weaker vessels astray.

628
00:35:07,417 --> 00:35:10,263
But is a man not equally attractive
when married?

629
00:35:10,361 --> 00:35:13,840
Oh, no married man is ever attractive,
except to his wife.

630
00:35:13,944 --> 00:35:16,528
And often, I've been told,
not even to her.

631
00:35:16,631 --> 00:35:20,972
Oh, doesn't that depend upon the
intellectual sympathies of the woman?

632
00:35:21,078 --> 00:35:23,499
Maturity can always be depended on.

633
00:35:23,605 --> 00:35:26,255
Ripeness can be trusted.

634
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:28,243
- Young women are green.
- Oh!

635
00:35:28,341 --> 00:35:32,202
I spoke horticulturally.
My metaphor was drawn from fruits.

636
00:35:32,308 --> 00:35:34,129
Fruits, yes.

637
00:35:36,147 --> 00:35:40,336
Mr. Ernest Worthing has just
driven over from the station, miss.

638
00:35:41,585 --> 00:35:43,951
He's brought his luggage with him.

639
00:35:45,233 --> 00:35:48,265
"Mr. Ernest Worthing,
B4, The Albany."

640
00:35:49,584 --> 00:35:51,656
Uncle Jack’s brother?

641
00:35:53,615 --> 00:35:56,265
Did you tell him
Mr. Worthing was in London?

642
00:35:56,366 --> 00:36:00,009
Yes, miss. He seemed
very much disappointed.

643
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:03,786
He said he would like to speak to you
privately for a moment.

644
00:36:03,885 --> 00:36:07,080
I've left him in the morning room.

645
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:09,001
Thank you, Merriman.

646
00:36:14,954 --> 00:36:17,702
I've never met
a really wicked person before.

647
00:36:17,802 --> 00:36:19,688
I feel rather frightened.

648
00:36:19,785 --> 00:36:22,533
I'm so afraid he'll look
just like everyone else.

649
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,118
He does.

650
00:36:37,221 --> 00:36:40,187
You are my little cousin Cecily,
I'm sure.

651
00:36:41,797 --> 00:36:44,992
You are under some
strange misapprehension.

652
00:36:45,091 --> 00:36:49,465
I am not little. In fact, I believe that
I am more than usually tall for my age.

653
00:36:50,466 --> 00:36:53,465
But I am your cousin Cecily.

654
00:36:53,569 --> 00:36:56,535
You, I see from your card,
are Uncle Jack’s brother,

655
00:36:56,641 --> 00:36:58,909
my cousin Ernest.

656
00:36:59,009 --> 00:37:02,106
My wicked cousin Ernest.

657
00:37:02,207 --> 00:37:04,377
Oh, I am not really wicked at all,
Cousin Cecily.

658
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,584
You mustn't think I'm wicked.

659
00:37:07,614 --> 00:37:10,995
If you are not, then you have
certainly been deceiving us all...

660
00:37:11,101 --> 00:37:13,173
in a very inexcusable manner.

661
00:37:14,173 --> 00:37:17,467
I hope you have not been leading
a double life,

662
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:22,899
pretending to be wicked
and being really good all the time.

663
00:37:23,003 --> 00:37:25,653
That would be hypocrisy.

664
00:37:27,098 --> 00:37:29,966
Of course, I...
I have been rather reckless.

665
00:37:30,074 --> 00:37:31,895
I'm glad to hear it.

666
00:37:31,993 --> 00:37:33,814
In fact, now you mention
the subject,

667
00:37:33,913 --> 00:37:37,425
I really have been very bad
in my own small way.

668
00:37:37,528 --> 00:37:40,658
I don't think you should be
so proud of that,

669
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:42,962
though I'm sure
it must have been very pleasant.

670
00:37:43,063 --> 00:37:45,517
It's much pleasanter
being here with you.

671
00:37:45,622 --> 00:37:47,661
I can't understand
how you're here at all.

672
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:50,220
Uncle Jack won't be back
till Monday afternoon.

673
00:37:50,325 --> 00:37:52,146
That is a great disappointment.

674
00:37:52,245 --> 00:37:54,699
I'm obliged to go up
by the first train Monday morning.

675
00:37:54,804 --> 00:37:56,690
I have a business appointment
that I am anxious...

676
00:37:57,939 --> 00:37:59,880
to miss.

677
00:37:59,987 --> 00:38:02,408
Couldn't you miss it
anywhere but in London?

678
00:38:02,515 --> 00:38:04,685
No, the appointment is in London.

679
00:38:06,481 --> 00:38:10,670
Well, I know, of course,
how important it is...

680
00:38:10,768 --> 00:38:12,906
not to keep
a business engagement.

681
00:38:14,224 --> 00:38:17,539
Still, I think you had better wait
until Uncle Jack arrives.

682
00:38:17,647 --> 00:38:19,980
I know he wants to speak to you
about your emigrating.

683
00:38:20,078 --> 00:38:22,216
My what?

684
00:38:23,789 --> 00:38:26,406
About your emigrating.
He's gone up to buy your outfit.

685
00:38:26,509 --> 00:38:28,996
I certainly wouldn't allow Jack
to buy my outfit.

686
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,587
He has got absolutely no taste
at all in neckties.

687
00:38:31,692 --> 00:38:34,244
I don't think
that you will require a necktie.

688
00:38:34,347 --> 00:38:36,168
Uncle Jack is sending you
to Australia.

689
00:38:36,266 --> 00:38:40,520
Australia?
I'd sooner die.

690
00:38:40,617 --> 00:38:43,169
He said at dinner on Wednesday
night that you would have to choose...

691
00:38:43,273 --> 00:38:46,087
between this world,
the next world,

692
00:38:46,184 --> 00:38:48,005
and Australia.

693
00:38:48,104 --> 00:38:50,885
Oh. Well, the reports I have
of Australia and the next world...

694
00:38:50,983 --> 00:38:53,600
are not particularly encouraging.

695
00:38:53,703 --> 00:38:56,484
This world is good enough
for me, Cousin Cecily.

696
00:38:56,582 --> 00:38:59,810
Yes. But are you
good enough for it?

697
00:39:00,997 --> 00:39:02,851
Well, no, I am not that.

698
00:39:02,949 --> 00:39:04,803
That is why I would like you
to reform me.

699
00:39:04,901 --> 00:39:08,096
You might make that your mission,
if you don't mind, Cousin Cecily.

700
00:39:08,195 --> 00:39:10,747
I am afraid I have
no time this afternoon.

701
00:39:10,851 --> 00:39:13,719
Well, would you mind
if I reform myself this afternoon?

702
00:39:13,826 --> 00:39:17,851
It is rather romantic of you,
but I think you should try.

703
00:39:17,953 --> 00:39:19,774
I will.

704
00:39:21,825 --> 00:39:25,304
- I feel better already.
- You are looking a little worse.

705
00:39:25,408 --> 00:39:29,116
- That's because I'm hungry.
- Oh, how thoughtless of me!

706
00:39:29,215 --> 00:39:32,509
I should have remembered that when one
is going to lead an entirely new life,

707
00:39:32,606 --> 00:39:35,125
one requires regular
and wholesome meals.

708
00:39:35,229 --> 00:39:37,050
Might I have a buttonhole first?

709
00:39:37,149 --> 00:39:41,141
L-I never have any appetite
unless I have a buttonhole.

710
00:39:41,244 --> 00:39:44,178
A Marechale Niel?

711
00:39:44,284 --> 00:39:47,861
- No, I would sooner have a pink rose.
- Why?

712
00:39:47,963 --> 00:39:50,897
Because you are like a pink rose,
Cousin Cecily.

713
00:39:52,794 --> 00:39:56,502
I don't think it can be right
for you to say such things to me.

714
00:39:57,593 --> 00:40:00,341
Miss Prism never talks like that.

715
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,505
Then Miss Prism is
a shortsighted old lady.

716
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:09,102
You are the prettiest girl
I ever saw.

717
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:12,882
Miss Prism says
that all good looks are a snare.

718
00:40:12,981 --> 00:40:15,882
Then they are a snare that any sensible
man would like to be caught in.

719
00:40:15,988 --> 00:40:17,809
Oh?

720
00:40:17,908 --> 00:40:21,354
I don't think I should care
to catch a sensible man.

721
00:40:21,459 --> 00:40:24,491
I wouldn't know
what to talk to him about.

722
00:40:41,391 --> 00:40:43,463
Mr. Worthing.

723
00:40:44,462 --> 00:40:46,795
- Mr. Worthing.
- Dear Mr. Worthing,

724
00:40:46,894 --> 00:40:50,951
I trust this garb of woe does not
betoken some terrible calamity.

725
00:40:54,316 --> 00:40:56,933
- My brother.
- More shameful debts and extravagance?

726
00:41:00,107 --> 00:41:04,808
- Dead.
- Your brother Ernest dead?

727
00:41:06,217 --> 00:41:08,289
Quite dead.

728
00:41:09,705 --> 00:41:12,573
What a lesson for him.
I trust he will profit by it.

729
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:17,185
Oh, Mr. Worthing, I...
I offer my sincere condolence.

730
00:41:17,287 --> 00:41:22,337
Poor Ernest. He had many faults,
but it is a sad, sad blow.

731
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:25,819
Oh, very sad indeed.
Were you with him at the end?

732
00:41:25,925 --> 00:41:28,095
No, he died abroad.
In Paris, in fact.

733
00:41:28,196 --> 00:41:30,813
I had a telegram last night
from the manager of the Grand Hotel.

734
00:41:30,916 --> 00:41:34,395
- Was the cause of death mentioned?
- A severe chill, it seems.

735
00:41:35,394 --> 00:41:38,295
As a man sows,
so let him reap.

736
00:41:38,402 --> 00:41:40,921
Charity, dear Miss Prism, charity.
None of us are perfect.

737
00:41:41,026 --> 00:41:44,189
I myself am peculiarly
susceptible to drafts.

738
00:41:44,288 --> 00:41:46,709
Will the interment
take place here?

739
00:41:46,816 --> 00:41:50,360
No, he seems to have expressed
a desire to be buried in Paris.

740
00:41:50,463 --> 00:41:52,404
Paris!

741
00:41:52,511 --> 00:41:57,266
I fear that hardly points to any
very serious state of mind at the last.

742
00:41:57,374 --> 00:41:59,577
Oh, Uncle Jack!

743
00:41:59,678 --> 00:42:01,652
I'm so glad to see you back,

744
00:42:01,757 --> 00:42:03,643
but what horrid clothes
you have got on.

745
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:06,073
- Cecily!
- My child, my child.

746
00:42:06,172 --> 00:42:10,262
Do look happy.
I have got such a surprise for you.

747
00:42:10,363 --> 00:42:12,304
Who do you think
is in the dining room?

748
00:42:12,411 --> 00:42:14,930
- Your brother!
- Who?

749
00:42:15,034 --> 00:42:18,480
Your brother Ernest.
He arrived about half an hour ago.

750
00:42:18,585 --> 00:42:20,406
Well, what nonsense.
I haven't got a brother.

751
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:22,325
Oh, don't say that.

752
00:42:22,424 --> 00:42:24,528
However badly he may have behaved
to you in the past,

753
00:42:24,632 --> 00:42:26,704
he is still your brother.

754
00:42:26,808 --> 00:42:29,295
You couldn't be so heartless
as to disown him.

755
00:42:30,295 --> 00:42:33,872
And you will shake hands
with him, won't you, Uncle Jack?

756
00:42:36,821 --> 00:42:39,308
These are very joyful tidings, hmm?

757
00:42:39,412 --> 00:42:42,029
After we had all been resigned
to his loss,

758
00:42:42,132 --> 00:42:45,360
his sudden return seems to me
peculiarly distressing.

759
00:42:50,418 --> 00:42:52,490
- Good heavens!
- Brother John.

760
00:42:52,593 --> 00:42:56,039
I have come all the way from London
to tell you how very sorry I am...

761
00:42:56,145 --> 00:42:58,086
for all the trouble
that I have caused you,

762
00:42:58,192 --> 00:43:01,540
and that I intend to lead
a better life in the future.

763
00:43:02,543 --> 00:43:05,837
Uncle Jack, you are not going
to refuse your own brother's hand.

764
00:43:05,934 --> 00:43:07,875
Nothing would induce me
to take his hand.

765
00:43:07,983 --> 00:43:10,949
I consider his coming here disgraceful.
He... He knows perfectly well why.

766
00:43:11,054 --> 00:43:14,947
Uncle Jack, do be nice.
There is some good in everyone.

767
00:43:15,053 --> 00:43:16,874
Ernest has just been telling me...

768
00:43:16,973 --> 00:43:19,655
about his poor invalid friend,
Mr. Bunbury.

769
00:43:19,756 --> 00:43:21,762
Oh, he's been telling you
about Bunbury, has he?

770
00:43:21,867 --> 00:43:24,681
I won't have him talking to you
about Bunbury or about anything else.

771
00:43:24,778 --> 00:43:27,144
Of course, I admit that all the faults
are on my side,

772
00:43:27,242 --> 00:43:32,390
but I must say I think brother John’s
coldness to me on my first visit here...

773
00:43:32,488 --> 00:43:34,462
peculiarly painful.

774
00:43:34,568 --> 00:43:37,534
Uncle Jack, if you won't
shake hands with Ernest,

775
00:43:37,639 --> 00:43:39,580
I will never forgive you.

776
00:43:39,687 --> 00:43:41,988
- Never forgive me?
- Never.

777
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:43,907
Never, never.

778
00:43:44,006 --> 00:43:46,656
Well, this is the last time
I shall do it.

779
00:43:46,758 --> 00:43:50,586
- We might leave the brothers together.
- Cecily, you will come with us.

780
00:43:50,693 --> 00:43:52,514
Certainly, Miss Prism.

781
00:43:52,612 --> 00:43:55,611
My little task
of reconciliation is over.

782
00:43:57,731 --> 00:44:00,152
Algy, you young scoundrel,
you must leave this place at once.

783
00:44:00,259 --> 00:44:02,429
L-I won't have any Bunburying here.

784
00:44:03,457 --> 00:44:04,416
Merriman,
order the dogcart at once.

785
00:44:04,417 --> 00:44:05,823
Merriman,
order the dogcart at once.

786
00:44:05,922 --> 00:44:08,888
Mr. Ernest has been called back
suddenly to town.

787
00:44:09,888 --> 00:44:11,709
Yes, sir.

788
00:44:12,768 --> 00:44:14,589
What a fearful liar you are, Jack.

789
00:44:14,687 --> 00:44:16,988
- I haven't been called back to town.
- Oh, yes, you have.

790
00:44:17,087 --> 00:44:18,908
I haven't heard anyone call me.

791
00:44:19,007 --> 00:44:21,428
Your duty as a gentleman
calls you back.

792
00:44:21,534 --> 00:44:23,355
I have never allowed my duty
as a gentleman...

793
00:44:23,454 --> 00:44:25,755
to interfere with my pleasures
to the smallest degree.

794
00:44:25,853 --> 00:44:27,739
I can quite understand that.

795
00:44:28,732 --> 00:44:30,618
Well, Cecily is a darling.

796
00:44:30,716 --> 00:44:33,300
You are not to speak of Miss Cardew
that way. I don't like it.

797
00:44:33,404 --> 00:44:36,250
Well, I don't like your clothes.
You look perfectly grotesque in them.

798
00:44:36,346 --> 00:44:38,232
Why on earth
don't you go up and change?

799
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:40,216
It's perfectly childish
to be in deep mourning...

800
00:44:40,314 --> 00:44:43,728
for a man who is staying for a whole
week in your own house as a guest.

801
00:44:43,833 --> 00:44:46,734
You are not staying with me for a whole
week as a guest or anything else!

802
00:44:46,841 --> 00:44:49,655
You are going to leave this afternoon
by the four-five train.

803
00:44:49,752 --> 00:44:52,718
I certainly shall not leave
as long as you are in mourning.

804
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:54,644
It would be most unfriendly.

805
00:44:54,742 --> 00:44:56,977
If I were in mourning,
you'd stay with me, I suppose.

806
00:44:57,078 --> 00:44:59,084
I should think it very unkind
if you did not.

807
00:44:59,189 --> 00:45:01,359
Well, will you go
if I change my clothes?

808
00:45:01,461 --> 00:45:04,078
- Yes, if you don't take too long.

809
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:07,114
I never saw a man take so long
to dress with such little result.

810
00:45:08,115 --> 00:45:12,237
Well, at any rate, that is better than
being always overdressed, as you are.

811
00:45:12,339 --> 00:45:15,021
This Bunburying,
as you call it,

812
00:45:15,122 --> 00:45:18,023
has not been a great success for you.

813
00:45:23,952 --> 00:45:26,056
It think it's been a great success.

814
00:45:30,639 --> 00:45:32,460
You rang, sir?

815
00:45:32,558 --> 00:45:35,688
Merriman, am I correctly garbed
for a christening?

816
00:45:36,685 --> 00:45:40,807
No, sir. Black is for funerals
and weddings, sir.

817
00:45:40,908 --> 00:45:44,769
White is for christenings.
I'll lay out your tennis clothes, sir.

818
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:46,696
Thank you, Merriman.

819
00:46:12,773 --> 00:46:15,903
Oh! I thought you were
with Uncle Jack.

820
00:46:16,004 --> 00:46:18,010
He has gone to order
the dogcart for me.

821
00:46:18,116 --> 00:46:20,122
Oh, is he going to take you
for a nice drive?

822
00:46:20,227 --> 00:46:22,048
He's going to send me away.

823
00:46:23,555 --> 00:46:26,849
- Then have we got to part?
- I'm afraid so.

824
00:46:26,946 --> 00:46:28,855
'Tis very painful parting.

825
00:46:28,961 --> 00:46:30,847
It is always painful to part
from people...

826
00:46:30,945 --> 00:46:34,108
whom one has known
for only a very brief space of time.

827
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,989
The absence of old friends
one can endure with equanimity,

828
00:46:37,983 --> 00:46:41,331
but even a momentary separation
from anyone...

829
00:46:41,439 --> 00:46:46,172
to whom one has just been
introduced is almost unbearable.

830
00:46:46,269 --> 00:46:48,504
- Thank you.

831
00:46:48,605 --> 00:46:51,506
The dogcart is at the door, sir.

832
00:46:53,532 --> 00:46:56,978
It can wait, Merriman,
for five minutes.

833
00:46:58,043 --> 00:46:59,733
Yes, miss.

834
00:47:02,106 --> 00:47:04,625
I hope, Cecily, I shall not offend you...

835
00:47:04,729 --> 00:47:07,510
if I state quite openly and frankly
that you seem to me to be...

836
00:47:07,609 --> 00:47:10,423
the visible personification
of absolute perfection.

837
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:13,650
I think your frankness
does you great credit, Ernest.

838
00:47:13,751 --> 00:47:17,230
If you will allow me,
I will copy your remarks into my diary.

839
00:47:20,278 --> 00:47:23,146
Do you really keep a diary?
I'd give anything to see it.

840
00:47:23,253 --> 00:47:25,423
- May I?
- Oh, no.

841
00:47:25,525 --> 00:47:27,979
You see, it is simply
a very young girl's record...

842
00:47:28,085 --> 00:47:30,255
of her own thoughts
and impressions,

843
00:47:30,356 --> 00:47:32,265
and consequently meant
for publication.

844
00:47:32,371 --> 00:47:35,850
Oh, when it appears in volume form,
I hope you will order a copy.

845
00:47:35,955 --> 00:47:39,215
But pray, Ernest, don't stop.
I delight in taking down from dictation.

846
00:47:39,313 --> 00:47:43,370
"I have reached
absolute perfection."

847
00:47:43,473 --> 00:47:45,545
You may go on.
I'm quite ready for more.

848
00:47:45,648 --> 00:47:48,963
- Oh, don't cough, Ernest.

849
00:47:49,071 --> 00:47:51,590
I don't know how to spell a cough.

850
00:47:51,695 --> 00:47:54,279
Cecily, ever since I first saw...

851
00:47:54,382 --> 00:47:57,348
your wonderful
and incomparable perfection,

852
00:47:57,453 --> 00:48:01,761
I have dared to love you wildly,
passionately, devotedly,

853
00:48:01,869 --> 00:48:03,843
hopelessly.

854
00:48:03,949 --> 00:48:06,152
I don't think you should tell me
that you love me...

855
00:48:06,252 --> 00:48:09,382
wildly, passionately,
devotedly, hopelessly.

856
00:48:10,378 --> 00:48:14,567
"Hopelessly" doesn't seem
to make much sense, does it?

857
00:48:14,665 --> 00:48:17,315
- Cecily!

858
00:48:19,337 --> 00:48:21,278
The dogcart is waiting, sir.

859
00:48:21,384 --> 00:48:23,358
Tell it to come round
next week at the same hour.

860
00:48:29,191 --> 00:48:31,045
Very good, sir.

861
00:48:34,918 --> 00:48:36,827
I think Uncle Jack would be
very much annoyed...

862
00:48:36,933 --> 00:48:39,649
if he knew you were staying
until next week at the same hour.

863
00:48:39,748 --> 00:48:41,569
I don't care about Jack.

864
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:44,285
I don't care for anybody
in the world but you.

865
00:48:44,387 --> 00:48:46,557
I love you, Cecily.
Will you marry me?

866
00:48:46,659 --> 00:48:49,974
Of course. Why, we've been engaged
for the last three months.

867
00:48:50,082 --> 00:48:51,903
The last three months?

868
00:48:52,001 --> 00:48:54,269
Yes, it will be exactly
three months on Thursday.

869
00:48:54,368 --> 00:48:56,472
But how did we become engaged?

870
00:48:56,577 --> 00:48:58,878
Well, ever since dear Uncle Jack
first confessed to us...

871
00:48:58,976 --> 00:49:02,291
that he had a younger brother
who was very wicked and bad,

872
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,887
you, of course, have formed
the chief topic of conversation...

873
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:06,811
between myself and Miss Prism,

874
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:10,837
and, of course, a man who is much
talked about is always very attractive.

875
00:49:10,941 --> 00:49:13,525
One always feels there must be
something in him after all.

876
00:49:14,524 --> 00:49:17,370
I daresay it was foolish of me,

877
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:21,114
but I fell in love with you, Ernest.

878
00:49:21,211 --> 00:49:24,657
Darling! And when was
our engagement actually settled?

879
00:49:24,762 --> 00:49:27,281
On the 22nd of February last.

880
00:49:28,345 --> 00:49:31,889
Worn out by your entire ignorance
of my existence,

881
00:49:31,993 --> 00:49:35,886
I determined to end the matter
one way or the other,

882
00:49:36,888 --> 00:49:39,702
and, after a long struggle
with myself,

883
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:42,548
I accepted you...

884
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:45,067
under that dear old chandelier there.

885
00:49:45,174 --> 00:49:48,468
And then, next day,
I bought this ring in your name.

886
00:49:49,461 --> 00:49:52,809
And this is the bangle
with the true lovers' knot...

887
00:49:52,915 --> 00:49:54,889
that I promised you
always to wear.

888
00:49:54,995 --> 00:49:57,929
Did I give you this?
It's very pretty, isn't it?

889
00:49:58,035 --> 00:50:00,685
Yes. Yes, you've wonderfully
good taste, Ernest.

890
00:50:00,786 --> 00:50:03,981
It's always been my excuse
for your leading such a bad life.

891
00:50:05,297 --> 00:50:07,118
And then...

892
00:50:08,305 --> 00:50:12,810
this is the box in which
I keep all your dear letters.

893
00:50:12,912 --> 00:50:16,707
My letters? But, my own sweet Cecily,
I never wrote you any letters.

894
00:50:16,814 --> 00:50:18,635
You need hardly
remind me of that, Ernest.

895
00:50:18,734 --> 00:50:21,766
I remember only too well I was forced
to write all your letters for you.

896
00:50:21,869 --> 00:50:25,064
I wrote three times a week.
Sometimes oftener.

897
00:50:25,165 --> 00:50:27,619
- Oh, do let me read them.
- Oh, no, you couldn't possibly!

898
00:50:27,724 --> 00:50:30,756
They would make you
far too conceited.

899
00:50:30,859 --> 00:50:32,680
The three you wrote to me...

900
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:34,917
after our engagement
had been broken off...

901
00:50:35,914 --> 00:50:37,855
are so beautiful...

902
00:50:37,962 --> 00:50:39,848
and so badly spelled...

903
00:50:40,873 --> 00:50:44,101
that even now I can hardly read them
without crying a little.

904
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:47,679
- But was our engagement broken off?
- Of course it was.

905
00:50:47,783 --> 00:50:52,637
On the 22nd of last March.
You can see the entry, if you like.

906
00:50:52,742 --> 00:50:56,450
"Today I broke off my engagement with
Ernest. I feel it is better to do so.

907
00:50:56,550 --> 00:50:58,753
The weather still continues
charming."

908
00:50:59,749 --> 00:51:03,130
But why on earth did you break it off?
What had I done?

909
00:51:03,236 --> 00:51:05,057
I had done nothing at all.

910
00:51:05,155 --> 00:51:07,772
Cecily, I am very much hurt indeed
that you broke it off,

911
00:51:07,876 --> 00:51:09,915
particularly when the weather
was so charming.

912
00:51:10,019 --> 00:51:12,800
But it would hardly have been
a really serious engagement...

913
00:51:12,898 --> 00:51:15,101
if it hadn't been broken off
at least once.

914
00:51:16,129 --> 00:51:18,997
But I forgave you
before the week was out.

915
00:51:19,104 --> 00:51:21,372
What a perfect angel you are!

916
00:51:23,072 --> 00:51:26,366
You won't ever break off
our engagement again, will you?

917
00:51:26,463 --> 00:51:29,179
I don't think I could,
now that I've actually met you.

918
00:51:30,174 --> 00:51:32,824
Besides, of course,
there is the question of your name.

919
00:51:33,982 --> 00:51:35,803
Of course.

920
00:51:35,901 --> 00:51:37,810
You mustn't laugh at me, darling,

921
00:51:37,917 --> 00:51:40,785
but it had always been
a girlish dream of mine...

922
00:51:40,892 --> 00:51:44,404
to love someone
by the name of Ernest.

923
00:51:44,507 --> 00:51:49,524
There is something in that name that
seems to inspire absolute confidence.

924
00:51:50,521 --> 00:51:53,781
Indeed, I pity any poor married woman
whose husband is not called Ernest.

925
00:51:53,881 --> 00:51:55,735
But, my dear child,
do you mean to say...

926
00:51:55,832 --> 00:51:57,970
that you couldn't love me
if I had some other name?

927
00:51:58,072 --> 00:52:00,210
- But what name?
- Well, any name you like. Um...

928
00:52:01,335 --> 00:52:03,156
Algernon, for instance.

929
00:52:03,255 --> 00:52:05,261
But I don't like
the name of Algernon.

930
00:52:05,366 --> 00:52:08,082
I... I really don't see why you should
object to the name of Algernon.

931
00:52:08,182 --> 00:52:10,352
It... It's not a bad name at all.

932
00:52:10,453 --> 00:52:12,274
In fact, it's rather
an aristocratic name.

933
00:52:12,373 --> 00:52:15,154
Half the chaps who get into the
bankruptcy court are called Algernon.

934
00:52:16,212 --> 00:52:20,967
But seriously, Cecily, if my name
was Algy, couldn't you love me?

935
00:52:21,075 --> 00:52:24,870
I might respect you, Ernest.
I might admire your character.

936
00:52:24,978 --> 00:52:29,232
But I fear that I should not be able
to give you my undivided attention.

937
00:52:29,329 --> 00:52:33,157
Cecily, your vicar here is, I suppose,
thoroughly experienced...

938
00:52:33,264 --> 00:52:35,718
in the practice of all the rites
and ceremonials of the church?

939
00:52:35,824 --> 00:52:37,678
Oh, yes. Dr. Chasuble
is a most learned man.

940
00:52:37,775 --> 00:52:41,035
I must see him at once on a most
important christen...
I mean, on most important business.

941
00:52:41,134 --> 00:52:42,955
- I won't be more than half an hour.
- Ernest!

942
00:52:45,677 --> 00:52:48,905
Considering that we have been engaged
since February the 22nd,

943
00:52:49,901 --> 00:52:53,161
and that I only met you today
for the first time,

944
00:52:53,259 --> 00:52:56,771
I think it is rather hard
that you should leave me...

945
00:52:56,875 --> 00:52:59,045
for so long a period
as half an hour.

946
00:53:00,042 --> 00:53:02,016
Couldn't you make it 20 minutes?

947
00:53:02,122 --> 00:53:04,194
I'll be back in no time.

948
00:53:30,724 --> 00:53:33,690
- Mr. Worthing.
- Good afternoon, Dr. Chasuble.

949
00:53:33,795 --> 00:53:35,933
You will, I trust, excuse...

950
00:53:36,035 --> 00:53:39,383
a postprandial relapse
into the arms of Morpheus.

951
00:53:39,489 --> 00:53:41,375
In other words, 40 winks.

952
00:53:41,473 --> 00:53:44,407
Dr. Chasuble, I suppose you know
how to christen all right?

953
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:47,194
I mean, of course, you are
continually christening, aren't you?

954
00:53:47,296 --> 00:53:50,775
It is, I regret to say, one of
my most constant duties in this parish.

955
00:53:50,879 --> 00:53:53,845
I've often spoken to the poorer
classes on the subject,

956
00:53:53,950 --> 00:53:56,818
but they don't seem
to know what thrift is.

957
00:53:56,925 --> 00:54:00,753
Is there any particular infant in whom
you're interested, Mr. Worthing?

958
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:03,281
- Yes.
- Of course... your brother.

959
00:54:03,388 --> 00:54:07,129
- I beg your pardon?
- Your brother, I know,
is unmarried, but, uh...

960
00:54:07,227 --> 00:54:09,844
Dr. Chasuble,
it is not for any child.

961
00:54:09,946 --> 00:54:13,458
The fact is, I was thinking of getting
christened myself this afternoon,

962
00:54:13,562 --> 00:54:15,383
if you've nothing better to do.

963
00:54:15,482 --> 00:54:17,750
But surely, Mr. Worthing,
you've been christened already?

964
00:54:17,849 --> 00:54:21,012
- I don't remember anything about it.
- Have you any grave doubts
on the subject?

965
00:54:21,112 --> 00:54:22,933
Well, I certainly intend to have.

966
00:54:23,031 --> 00:54:26,445
Unless, of course, you think
I'm a little too old now, hmm?

967
00:54:26,551 --> 00:54:28,372
Oh, not at all.

968
00:54:28,471 --> 00:54:31,699
Sprinkling and, indeed,
even the immersion of adults...

969
00:54:31,798 --> 00:54:34,285
is a perfectly canonical practice.

970
00:54:34,389 --> 00:54:36,461
- Immersion?
- You need have no apprehensions.

971
00:54:36,564 --> 00:54:38,668
- Sprinkling is all that is necessary...
- Ah.

972
00:54:38,773 --> 00:54:40,682
Or, indeed, I think, advisable.

973
00:54:40,788 --> 00:54:44,103
Our weather... so changeable.

974
00:54:44,211 --> 00:54:46,381
At what hour would you like
the ceremony performed?

975
00:54:46,482 --> 00:54:49,263
I thought I would trot around
about 5:00, if that would suit you.

976
00:54:49,362 --> 00:54:51,183
Oh, perfectly, perfectly.

977
00:54:51,281 --> 00:54:54,989
In fact, I have two similar ceremonies
to perform at that time.

978
00:54:55,089 --> 00:54:57,543
A case of twins
that occurred recently...

979
00:54:57,648 --> 00:55:00,908
in one of the... the outlying cottages
of your own estate.

980
00:55:01,007 --> 00:55:05,642
Poor Jenkins, the carter.
A most hardworking man.

981
00:55:05,742 --> 00:55:09,057
Well, I don't see much fun
in being christened
along with a lot of other babies.

982
00:55:09,165 --> 00:55:11,881
It would be childish.
Would half past 5:00 do?

983
00:55:11,981 --> 00:55:15,241
- Oh, admirably, admirably.
- Till half past 5:00, then.

984
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:17,575
Half past 5:00 at the font.

985
00:55:22,219 --> 00:55:24,487
- Come in.

986
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:28,231
Dr. Chasuble?

987
00:55:32,009 --> 00:55:35,204
"What a perfect angel
you are, Cecily."

988
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:42,433
But that is where he knelt.

989
00:55:43,942 --> 00:55:47,105
Yes, I am sure
that is where he knelt.

990
00:55:47,205 --> 00:55:50,848
A Miss Fairfax has called
to see Mr. Worthing, miss.

991
00:55:50,948 --> 00:55:54,296
On very important business,
Miss Fairfax states.

992
00:55:54,403 --> 00:55:56,257
Isn't Mr. Worthing in the library?

993
00:55:56,355 --> 00:56:00,609
Mr. Worthing went over in the direction
of the rectory some time ago, miss.

994
00:56:00,706 --> 00:56:04,382
Pray ask the lady to come out here.
Mr. Worthing is sure to be back soon.

995
00:56:04,481 --> 00:56:07,131
- And, Merriman, you may bring tea.
- Yes, miss.

996
00:56:09,408 --> 00:56:11,229
Oh, dear.

997
00:56:11,327 --> 00:56:15,003
One of the many good elderly women
associated with Uncle Jack...

998
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:18,102
in some of his philanthropic work
in London, I suppose.

999
00:56:18,206 --> 00:56:20,060
Miss Fairfax.

1000
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:29,841
Oh!

1001
00:56:32,442 --> 00:56:34,328
Miss Fairfax?

1002
00:56:35,322 --> 00:56:37,296
Pray let me introduce myself to you.

1003
00:56:37,401 --> 00:56:40,978
- My name is Cecily Cardew.
- What a very sweet name!

1004
00:56:41,081 --> 00:56:43,763
Something tells me
we're going to be great friends.

1005
00:56:43,864 --> 00:56:46,416
I like you already
more than I can say.

1006
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:49,552
My first impressions of people
are never wrong.

1007
00:56:49,655 --> 00:56:51,759
How nice of you
to like me so much...

1008
00:56:51,863 --> 00:56:55,756
after we have known one another
for such a comparatively short time.

1009
00:56:55,862 --> 00:56:57,716
Shall we sit over there?

1010
00:56:57,813 --> 00:57:00,234
- I may call you Cecily, may I not?
- With pleasure.

1011
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:02,892
And you will always call me
Gwendolen, won't you?

1012
00:57:02,996 --> 00:57:04,621
If you wish.

1013
00:57:04,723 --> 00:57:07,624
Then that's all quite settled,
is it not?

1014
00:57:07,731 --> 00:57:10,097
I hope so.

1015
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:15,503
Cecily,

1016
00:57:15,601 --> 00:57:18,829
Mama, whose views on education
are remarkably strict,

1017
00:57:18,928 --> 00:57:23,399
has brought me up to be extremely
shortsighted. It's part of her system.

1018
00:57:23,504 --> 00:57:28,042
So... do you mind my looking at you
through my glasses?

1019
00:57:29,102 --> 00:57:33,378
Oh, not at all, Gwendolen.
I'm very fond of being looked at.

1020
00:57:46,858 --> 00:57:50,173
You are here on a short visit,
I suppose?

1021
00:57:50,282 --> 00:57:52,769
- Oh, no. I live here.
- Really?

1022
00:57:52,873 --> 00:57:54,694
Your mother, no doubt,

1023
00:57:54,792 --> 00:57:58,271
or some female relative
of advanced years resides here also?

1024
00:57:58,375 --> 00:58:02,814
Oh, no, I have no mother.
Nor, in fact, any relations.

1025
00:58:02,918 --> 00:58:05,983
I am Mr. Worthing's ward.

1026
00:58:06,086 --> 00:58:07,907
Oh.

1027
00:58:08,006 --> 00:58:11,103
It is strange he never mentioned to me
that he had a ward.

1028
00:58:11,205 --> 00:58:17,149
How secretive of him.
He grows more interesting hourly.

1029
00:58:17,252 --> 00:58:19,106
I am not sure, however,

1030
00:58:19,203 --> 00:58:22,169
that the news inspires me
with feelings of unmixed delight.

1031
00:58:22,274 --> 00:58:25,818
In fact, if I may speak
quite candidly...

1032
00:58:25,922 --> 00:58:27,743
Pray do.

1033
00:58:27,841 --> 00:58:30,687
I think that whenever one has
anything unpleasant to say,

1034
00:58:30,785 --> 00:58:34,461
one should always be quite candid.

1035
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:38,519
Well, to speak
with perfect candor, Cecily,

1036
00:58:38,623 --> 00:58:41,305
I wish that you were fully 42...

1037
00:58:41,406 --> 00:58:44,503
and more than usually plain
for your age.

1038
00:58:44,605 --> 00:58:47,506
Ernest has a strong, upright nature.

1039
00:58:47,613 --> 00:58:50,547
I beg your pardon, Gwendolen.
Did you say Ernest?

1040
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:52,212
Yes.

1041
00:58:52,315 --> 00:58:55,794
Oh, but it is not Mr. Ernest Worthing
who is my guardian.

1042
00:58:55,899 --> 00:58:59,443
It is his brother,
his elder brother.

1043
00:58:59,546 --> 00:59:01,716
Ernest never mentioned to me
that he had a brother.

1044
00:59:01,817 --> 00:59:05,612
I'm sorry to say that they have not been
on good terms for a long time.

1045
00:59:05,721 --> 00:59:08,338
Ah, that accounts for it.

1046
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:12,660
Of course, you are quite...
quite sure that...

1047
00:59:12,759 --> 00:59:15,475
it is not Mr. Ernest Worthing
who is your guardian?

1048
00:59:15,574 --> 00:59:17,940
Quite sure.

1049
00:59:18,038 --> 00:59:22,259
In fact, I am going to be his...

1050
00:59:22,357 --> 00:59:24,690
I beg your pardon?

1051
00:59:24,789 --> 00:59:27,570
Dearest Gwendolen,
there is no reason...

1052
00:59:27,668 --> 00:59:29,554
why I should make
a secret of it to you.

1053
00:59:29,651 --> 00:59:33,578
Our little county newspaper
is sure to chronicle the fact next week.

1054
00:59:33,683 --> 00:59:39,213
Mr. Ernest Worthing
and I are engaged to be married.

1055
00:59:39,313 --> 00:59:44,396
My darling Cecily,
I think there must be some slight error.

1056
00:59:44,496 --> 00:59:47,310
Mr. Ernest Worthing is engaged to me.

1057
00:59:47,407 --> 00:59:49,479
The announcement will appear
in the Morning Post...

1058
00:59:49,583 --> 00:59:52,167
on Saturday at the latest.

1059
00:59:52,271 --> 00:59:56,198
I am afraid you must be
under some misconception.

1060
00:59:56,302 --> 01:00:00,578
Ernest proposed to me
exactly ten minutes ago.

1061
01:00:02,125 --> 01:00:04,971
It is certainly very curious,

1062
01:00:05,067 --> 01:00:08,743
for he asked me to be his wife
yesterday afternoon at 5:30.

1063
01:00:08,843 --> 01:00:12,420
If you would care
to verify the incident, pray do so.

1064
01:00:12,522 --> 01:00:14,725
I never travel without my diary.

1065
01:00:14,825 --> 01:00:18,435
One should always have something
sensational to read in the train.

1066
01:00:18,537 --> 01:00:22,659
I am so sorry, dearest Cecily,

1067
01:00:22,759 --> 01:00:24,645
if it is any disappointment to you.

1068
01:00:24,743 --> 01:00:27,775
But I'm afraid
I have the prior claim.

1069
01:00:27,879 --> 01:00:31,969
It would distress me
more than I can say, dearest Gwendolen,

1070
01:00:32,070 --> 01:00:35,713
if it caused you
any mental or physical anguish,

1071
01:00:35,813 --> 01:00:39,641
but I feel bound to point out
that since Ernest proposed to you,

1072
01:00:39,748 --> 01:00:41,820
he has clearly changed his mind.

1073
01:00:41,924 --> 01:00:46,079
If the poor fellow has been entrapped
into any foolish promise,

1074
01:00:46,178 --> 01:00:49,624
I shall consider it my duty
to rescue him at once...

1075
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:51,735
and with a firm hand.

1076
01:00:51,841 --> 01:00:57,502
Whatever unfortunate entanglement
my dear boy may have got himself into,

1077
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:01,875
I will never reproach him with it
after we are married.

1078
01:01:01,983 --> 01:01:06,237
Do you allude to me, Miss Cardew,
as an entanglement?

1079
01:01:06,333 --> 01:01:08,242
You are presumptuous.

1080
01:01:08,350 --> 01:01:11,993
On an occasion of this kind,
it becomes more than a moral duty
to speak one's mind.

1081
01:01:12,092 --> 01:01:13,913
It becomes a pleasure.

1082
01:01:14,012 --> 01:01:15,833
Do you suggest, Miss Fairfax,

1083
01:01:15,931 --> 01:01:18,319
that I entrapped Ernest
into an engagement?

1084
01:01:18,427 --> 01:01:20,313
How dare you!

1085
01:01:20,411 --> 01:01:23,257
This is no time for wearing
the shallow mask of manners.

1086
01:01:23,354 --> 01:01:27,030
When I see a spade,
I call it a spade.

1087
01:01:27,129 --> 01:01:30,772
I am glad to say
I have never seen a spade.

1088
01:01:30,873 --> 01:01:35,443
It is obvious that our social spheres
have been widely different.

1089
01:01:36,503 --> 01:01:39,731
Shall I lay tea here as usual, miss?

1090
01:01:39,830 --> 01:01:42,676
Yes, as usual.

1091
01:01:55,091 --> 01:01:58,864
Are there many interesting walks
in the vicinity, Miss Cardew?

1092
01:01:58,962 --> 01:02:01,001
Oh, yes, a great many.

1093
01:02:01,105 --> 01:02:04,268
From the top of one of the hills,
quite close, one can see five counties.

1094
01:02:04,369 --> 01:02:07,564
Five counties?

1095
01:02:07,664 --> 01:02:11,372
Oh, I don't think I should like that.
I hate crowds.

1096
01:02:13,391 --> 01:02:15,812
I suppose that is why
you live in a town.

1097
01:02:17,838 --> 01:02:21,382
I had no idea
there were any flowers in the country.

1098
01:02:21,485 --> 01:02:25,029
Oh, flowers are as common here,
Miss Fairfax,

1099
01:02:25,133 --> 01:02:26,987
as people are in London.

1100
01:02:27,084 --> 01:02:29,832
May I offer you some tea?

1101
01:02:29,932 --> 01:02:32,451
Thank you.

1102
01:02:32,555 --> 01:02:34,409
Sugar?

1103
01:02:34,506 --> 01:02:40,167
No, thank you.
Sugar is not fashionable anymore.

1104
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:48,861
Cake... or bread and butter?

1105
01:02:48,967 --> 01:02:51,649
Bread and butter, please.
Thank you.

1106
01:02:51,751 --> 01:02:55,197
Cake is rarely seen
in the best houses nowadays.

1107
01:02:55,301 --> 01:02:59,096
Hand that... to Miss Fairfax.

1108
01:03:09,186 --> 01:03:11,902
You have filled my tea
with lumps of sugar.

1109
01:03:12,002 --> 01:03:15,099
And though I most distinctly
asked for bread and butter,

1110
01:03:15,201 --> 01:03:17,567
you have given me cake.

1111
01:03:17,665 --> 01:03:21,373
I am known for the gentleness
of my disposition...

1112
01:03:21,471 --> 01:03:24,023
and extraordinary sweetness
of my nature.

1113
01:03:24,127 --> 01:03:27,988
But I warn you, Miss Cardew,
you may go too far.

1114
01:03:28,094 --> 01:03:31,802
To save my poor, innocent,
trusting boy...

1115
01:03:31,902 --> 01:03:34,356
from the machinations
of any other girl,

1116
01:03:34,461 --> 01:03:37,624
there are no lengths
to which I would not go.

1117
01:03:37,724 --> 01:03:39,862
From the moment I saw you,
I distrusted you.

1118
01:03:39,963 --> 01:03:41,817
I felt that you were
false and deceitful.

1119
01:03:41,916 --> 01:03:43,802
I'm never deceived in such matters.

1120
01:03:43,898 --> 01:03:47,312
My first impressions of people
are invariably right.

1121
01:03:47,418 --> 01:03:51,061
It seems to me, Miss Fairfax, that
I am trespassing on your valuable time.

1122
01:03:51,161 --> 01:03:54,956
No doubt you have many other calls
of a similar character...

1123
01:03:55,064 --> 01:03:57,202
to make in the neighborhood.

1124
01:03:59,415 --> 01:04:01,236
Gwendolen!

1125
01:04:04,566 --> 01:04:07,020
My own Ernest.

1126
01:04:07,125 --> 01:04:09,807
- Gwendolen, darling.
- A moment.

1127
01:04:09,908 --> 01:04:13,584
May I ask if you are engaged
to be married to this young lady?

1128
01:04:13,684 --> 01:04:15,788
What, to dear little Cecily?
Good heavens, no.

1129
01:04:15,892 --> 01:04:18,160
What could have put such an idea
into your pretty little head?

1130
01:04:18,259 --> 01:04:20,014
Thank you. You may.

1131
01:04:20,114 --> 01:04:22,982
I knew there must be
some misunderstanding, Miss Fairfax.

1132
01:04:23,089 --> 01:04:26,088
The gentleman whose arm
is at present around your waist...

1133
01:04:26,193 --> 01:04:28,712
is my dear guardian,
Mr. John Worthing.

1134
01:04:28,817 --> 01:04:32,744
- I beg your pardon?
- This is Uncle Jack.

1135
01:04:32,847 --> 01:04:36,588
- Jack? Oh.
- Cecily?

1136
01:04:36,687 --> 01:04:39,981
- Here is Ernest.
- My own love.

1137
01:04:40,974 --> 01:04:42,860
A moment.

1138
01:04:42,957 --> 01:04:46,087
Are you by any chance engaged
to be married to this young lady?

1139
01:04:46,189 --> 01:04:49,035
To what young lady?
Good heavens! Gwendolen.

1140
01:04:49,132 --> 01:04:51,814
Yes, to good heavens Gwendolen.
I mean, Gwendolen.

1141
01:04:51,916 --> 01:04:55,908
Of course not.
What could have put such an idea
into your pretty little head?

1142
01:04:56,011 --> 01:04:59,239
Thank you. You may.

1143
01:04:59,338 --> 01:05:02,304
I felt there must be
some slight error, Miss Cardew.

1144
01:05:02,409 --> 01:05:04,896
The gentleman
who is now embracing you...

1145
01:05:05,001 --> 01:05:08,644
is my cousin,
Mr. Algernon Moncrieff.

1146
01:05:08,744 --> 01:05:11,132
Algernon Moncrieff?

1147
01:05:12,711 --> 01:05:15,361
Are you called Algernon?

1148
01:05:15,463 --> 01:05:19,324
- I cannot deny it.
- Oh!

1149
01:05:19,429 --> 01:05:22,689
Is your name really John?

1150
01:05:22,789 --> 01:05:25,821
Well, I could deny it if I liked.
I could deny anything if I liked.

1151
01:05:25,924 --> 01:05:27,930
But my name certainly is John.

1152
01:05:28,036 --> 01:05:31,482
A gross deception
has been practiced on both of us.

1153
01:05:31,586 --> 01:05:34,203
My poor, wounded Cecily.

1154
01:05:34,306 --> 01:05:36,825
My sweet, wronged Gwendolen.

1155
01:05:36,930 --> 01:05:39,776
You will call me sister, will you not?

1156
01:05:43,488 --> 01:05:46,748
There is just one question I would like
to be allowed to ask my guardian.

1157
01:05:46,847 --> 01:05:49,693
An admirable idea. Mr. Worthing,
there is just one question...

1158
01:05:49,790 --> 01:05:51,611
I would like to be permitted
to put to you.

1159
01:05:51,710 --> 01:05:53,945
Where is your brother Ernest?

1160
01:05:54,046 --> 01:05:56,500
We are both engaged to be married
to your brother Ernest,

1161
01:05:56,605 --> 01:05:59,124
so it is a matter of some importance
to us to know...

1162
01:05:59,228 --> 01:06:03,285
where your brother Ernest is
at present.

1163
01:06:03,388 --> 01:06:05,209
Gwendolen and Cecily,

1164
01:06:05,307 --> 01:06:09,845
I will tell you quite frankly...
that I have no brother Ernest.

1165
01:06:09,946 --> 01:06:12,662
- I have no brother at all.
- No brother at all?

1166
01:06:12,761 --> 01:06:14,484
None.

1167
01:06:14,585 --> 01:06:17,301
Have you never had
a brother of any kind?

1168
01:06:17,401 --> 01:06:19,407
Never, not even of any kind.

1169
01:06:19,512 --> 01:06:22,511
I am afraid it is quite clear, Cecily,

1170
01:06:22,615 --> 01:06:26,159
that neither of us is engaged
to be married to anyone.

1171
01:06:26,262 --> 01:06:28,944
It is not a very pleasant position...

1172
01:06:29,046 --> 01:06:32,754
for a young girl suddenly
to find herself in, is it?

1173
01:06:32,853 --> 01:06:35,154
Let us go into the house.

1174
01:06:35,252 --> 01:06:38,033
They will hardly venture
to come after us there.

1175
01:06:38,132 --> 01:06:42,254
No. Men are such cowards,
aren't they?

1176
01:06:50,833 --> 01:06:54,443
This ghastly state of affairs is what
you would call Bunburying, I suppose?

1177
01:06:54,544 --> 01:06:57,292
Yes, the most wonderful Bunbury
I ever had in my life.

1178
01:06:57,392 --> 01:07:00,936
Well, the only small satisfaction
I get out of the whole
of this wretched business...

1179
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:03,940
is that your friend Bunbury,
dear Algy, is quite exploded,

1180
01:07:04,046 --> 01:07:05,867
and a very good thing too.

1181
01:07:05,965 --> 01:07:08,386
Your brother is a little off-color,
isn't he, dear Jack?

1182
01:07:08,493 --> 01:07:10,314
And not a bad thing either.

1183
01:07:10,412 --> 01:07:14,153
As for your deceiving a sweet, simple,
innocent girl like Miss Cardew,
I can only say that it...

1184
01:07:14,252 --> 01:07:16,073
It's inexcusable.

1185
01:07:16,171 --> 01:07:18,057
To say nothing of the fact
that she is my ward.

1186
01:07:18,155 --> 01:07:22,529
I can see no possible defense at all
for your deceiving a clever, experienced
young lady like Miss Fairfax.

1187
01:07:22,634 --> 01:07:24,455
To say nothing of the fact
that she is my cousin.

1188
01:07:24,553 --> 01:07:28,065
I simply wanted to be engaged
to Gwendolen, that is all. I love her.

1189
01:07:28,169 --> 01:07:31,364
Well, I simply wanted to be engaged
to Cecily. I adore her.

1190
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:33,536
There is certainly no chance
of your marrying Miss Cardew.

1191
01:07:33,639 --> 01:07:37,118
I don't think there is
much likelihood, Jack,
of you and Miss Fairfax being united.

1192
01:07:39,174 --> 01:07:41,475
Guard!

1193
01:07:41,573 --> 01:07:43,677
Will you be good enough
to inform me...

1194
01:07:43,782 --> 01:07:48,832
how soon this railway train
arrives at Woolton?

1195
01:07:48,932 --> 01:07:51,298
Now, let me see.

1196
01:07:51,396 --> 01:07:54,493
There's Gothrington...
no, we've passed her.

1197
01:07:54,594 --> 01:07:58,716
Then there's Goostrey Halt, Sopley,

1198
01:07:58,818 --> 01:08:02,461
Cobbler's Corner, Combe Brissett,

1199
01:08:02,561 --> 01:08:06,935
High Totten, Low Totten,
Little...

1200
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:09,341
How you can sit there
calmly eating muffins...

1201
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:11,326
when we're in this terrible trouble,
I can't imagine.

1202
01:08:11,423 --> 01:08:13,244
You seem to be perfectly heartless.

1203
01:08:13,342 --> 01:08:15,283
I can't eat muffins
in an agitated manner.

1204
01:08:15,390 --> 01:08:17,625
The butter would probably
get on my cuffs.

1205
01:08:17,726 --> 01:08:21,074
One should always eat muffins quite
calmly. It's the only way to eat them.

1206
01:08:21,181 --> 01:08:24,213
I say it's perfectly heartless
to be eating them at all.

1207
01:08:24,316 --> 01:08:27,664
When I'm in trouble, eating
is the only thing that consoles me.

1208
01:08:33,722 --> 01:08:35,543
They are eating muffins!

1209
01:08:35,642 --> 01:08:37,714
Algy, I wish to goodness you would go.

1210
01:08:37,817 --> 01:08:39,856
But I've just made arrangements
with Dr. Chasuble...

1211
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:41,934
to be christened at 6:00
under the name of Ernest.

1212
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:44,046
My dear fellow, I've made arrangements
with Dr. Chasuble myself...

1213
01:08:44,151 --> 01:08:47,019
to be christened at 5:30, and I
naturally will take the name of Ernest.

1214
01:08:47,127 --> 01:08:49,133
I have a perfect right
to be christened if I like.

1215
01:08:49,239 --> 01:08:51,213
There's no evidence that
I was ever christened by anyone.

1216
01:08:51,319 --> 01:08:53,652
It's entirely different with you.
You've been christened already.

1217
01:08:53,749 --> 01:08:56,944
- Yes, but I haven't been
christened for years.
- Yes, but you have been christened.

1218
01:08:57,045 --> 01:09:00,688
- That is the important thing.
- Quite so. So I know
my constitution can stand it.

1219
01:09:00,788 --> 01:09:03,209
It might make you very unwell.

1220
01:09:03,315 --> 01:09:05,703
You can hardly have forgotten someone
very closely connected with you...

1221
01:09:05,811 --> 01:09:08,363
was nearly carried off in Paris
this week by a severe chill.

1222
01:09:08,466 --> 01:09:10,472
You talk as if a severe chill
were hereditary.

1223
01:09:10,578 --> 01:09:12,966
Well, it usen't to be, I know,
but it may be now.

1224
01:09:13,073 --> 01:09:15,821
Science is always making
wonderful improvements in things.

1225
01:09:20,943 --> 01:09:23,942
- They are looking this way.
- What effrontery!

1226
01:09:24,047 --> 01:09:27,820
- They are approaching!
- That is very forward of them.

1227
01:09:27,918 --> 01:09:32,040
Let us preserve a dignified silence.

1228
01:09:32,141 --> 01:09:36,580
Certainly.
It is the only thing to do now.

1229
01:09:56,872 --> 01:10:01,027
Mr. Worthing, I have something
very particular to ask you.

1230
01:10:01,127 --> 01:10:03,199
Much depends on your reply.

1231
01:10:03,302 --> 01:10:05,276
Your common sense
is invaluable, Gwendolen.

1232
01:10:05,381 --> 01:10:08,795
Mr. Moncrieff, kindly answer me
the following question.

1233
01:10:08,901 --> 01:10:12,161
Why did you pretend
to be my guardian's brother?

1234
01:10:12,260 --> 01:10:14,844
In order that I might
have an opportunity of meeting you.

1235
01:10:16,611 --> 01:10:19,545
That certainly seems
a satisfactory explanation, does it not?

1236
01:10:19,650 --> 01:10:21,438
Yes, dear, if you can believe him.

1237
01:10:21,538 --> 01:10:24,439
Mr. Worthing, what explanation
can you offer me...

1238
01:10:24,545 --> 01:10:26,617
for pretending to have a brother?

1239
01:10:26,721 --> 01:10:29,502
Was it in order that you might have
an opportunity...

1240
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,966
of coming up to town
to see me as often as possible?

1241
01:10:32,063 --> 01:10:34,745
Can you doubt it, Miss Fairfax?

1242
01:10:34,847 --> 01:10:38,162
I have the gravest doubts
on the subject,

1243
01:10:38,270 --> 01:10:41,335
but I intend to crush them.

1244
01:10:41,438 --> 01:10:45,233
Their explanations appear to me
to have the stamp of truth on them.

1245
01:10:45,340 --> 01:10:47,827
Especially Mr. Worthing's.

1246
01:10:47,932 --> 01:10:50,746
I am more than content
with what Mr. Moncrieff has said.

1247
01:10:52,091 --> 01:10:55,570
His voice alone inspires one
with absolute credulity.

1248
01:10:55,675 --> 01:11:00,310
- Then you think we should forgive them?
- Yes.

1249
01:11:00,409 --> 01:11:02,448
I mean, no.

1250
01:11:02,553 --> 01:11:04,374
True, I had forgotten.

1251
01:11:04,473 --> 01:11:08,246
There are principles at stake
that one cannot surrender.

1252
01:11:08,344 --> 01:11:11,921
Which of us should tell them?
The task is not a pleasant one.

1253
01:11:12,023 --> 01:11:14,640
- Could we not both speak
at the same time?
- An excellent idea.

1254
01:11:14,742 --> 01:11:17,458
I nearly always speak
at the same time as other people.

1255
01:11:17,558 --> 01:11:19,946
Will you take the time from me?

1256
01:11:20,053 --> 01:11:24,623
Your Christian names are still
an insuperable barrier. That is all.

1257
01:11:24,724 --> 01:11:27,821
Our Christian names? Is that all?

1258
01:11:27,923 --> 01:11:30,540
But we're going to be
christened this afternoon.

1259
01:11:30,643 --> 01:11:33,609
For my sake you are prepared
to do this terrible thing?

1260
01:11:35,026 --> 01:11:36,814
I am.

1261
01:11:36,913 --> 01:11:40,228
To please me you are ready
to face this fearful ordeal?

1262
01:11:40,337 --> 01:11:41,830
I am.

1263
01:11:41,936 --> 01:11:45,448
How absurd to talk of
the equality of the sexes.

1264
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:48,419
Where questions of self-sacrifice
are concerned,

1265
01:11:48,527 --> 01:11:51,275
men are infinitely beyond us.

1266
01:11:51,374 --> 01:11:53,707
We are.

1267
01:11:56,205 --> 01:11:58,571
Darling!

1268
01:12:01,675 --> 01:12:05,864
Gwendolen!
What does this mean?

1269
01:12:05,962 --> 01:12:09,277
Merely that I am engaged
to Mr. Worthing, Mama.

1270
01:12:10,665 --> 01:12:13,511
Come here. Sit down.

1271
01:12:15,304 --> 01:12:17,605
Sit down, immediately!

1272
01:12:20,232 --> 01:12:23,329
Mr. Worthing,
you will clearly understand...

1273
01:12:23,431 --> 01:12:26,746
that all communication between
yourself and my daughter...

1274
01:12:26,854 --> 01:12:29,755
must cease immediately
from this moment.

1275
01:12:29,861 --> 01:12:33,569
On this, as indeed on all points,
I am firm.

1276
01:12:33,669 --> 01:12:36,570
I am engaged to be married
to Gwendolen, Lady Bracknell.

1277
01:12:36,676 --> 01:12:40,384
You are nothing of the kind, sir.

1278
01:12:41,539 --> 01:12:43,960
And now, as regards Algernon.

1279
01:12:44,066 --> 01:12:46,716
- Algernon!
- Yes, Aunt Augusta?

1280
01:12:46,818 --> 01:12:49,719
May I ask if it is in this house...

1281
01:12:49,825 --> 01:12:53,402
that your invalid friend,
Mr. Bunbury, resides?

1282
01:12:53,504 --> 01:12:57,561
Oh, no. Bunbury doesn't live here.
Bunbury is somewhere else at present.

1283
01:12:57,663 --> 01:12:59,669
In fact, Bunbury is dead.

1284
01:13:01,215 --> 01:13:03,865
Dead? When did Mr. Bunbury die?

1285
01:13:03,966 --> 01:13:08,187
Oh, I killed Bunbury this afternoon.
I mean, Bunbury died this afternoon.

1286
01:13:08,285 --> 01:13:10,837
What did he die of?

1287
01:13:10,940 --> 01:13:13,622
Bunbury?
Oh, he was quite exploded.

1288
01:13:13,724 --> 01:13:16,057
Exploded?

1289
01:13:16,155 --> 01:13:19,449
Was he a victim
of a revolutionary outrage?

1290
01:13:19,547 --> 01:13:22,328
My dear Aunt Augusta,
I mean, he was found out.

1291
01:13:22,426 --> 01:13:25,108
The doctors found out that
Bunbury could not live.

1292
01:13:25,209 --> 01:13:28,274
- That is what I mean. So Bunbury died.
- Hmm.

1293
01:13:28,376 --> 01:13:32,914
And now that we have
finally got rid of this Mr. Bunbury,

1294
01:13:33,015 --> 01:13:36,723
may I ask Mr. Worthing
who is that young person...

1295
01:13:36,823 --> 01:13:39,310
whose hand
my nephew Algernon is holding...

1296
01:13:39,413 --> 01:13:43,121
in what appears to me to be
a peculiarly unnecessary manner?

1297
01:13:43,221 --> 01:13:47,016
That lady
is Miss Cecily Cardew, my ward.

1298
01:13:47,124 --> 01:13:50,090
I am engaged to be married
to Cecily, Aunt Augusta.

1299
01:13:50,196 --> 01:13:52,748
I beg your pardon?

1300
01:13:52,850 --> 01:13:57,355
Mr. Moncrieff and I are engaged
to be married, Lady Bracknell.

1301
01:13:57,458 --> 01:14:02,988
Indeed? I think some preliminary inquiry
on my part would not be out of place.

1302
01:14:03,089 --> 01:14:07,976
Mr. Worthing,
is Miss Cardew at all connected...

1303
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:11,875
with any of the larger
railway stations in London?

1304
01:14:11,983 --> 01:14:14,665
I merely require information.

1305
01:14:14,766 --> 01:14:17,318
Until yesterday, I had no idea...

1306
01:14:17,421 --> 01:14:22,056
there were any families or persons
whose origin was a terminus.

1307
01:14:22,156 --> 01:14:26,148
Miss Cardew is the granddaughter
of the late Mr. Thomas Cardew...

1308
01:14:26,251 --> 01:14:30,373
of 149 Belgrave Square,
Southwest, Gervase Park,

1309
01:14:30,475 --> 01:14:34,434
Dorking, Surrey
and the Sperran Fifeshire.

1310
01:14:34,537 --> 01:14:36,838
That sounds not unsatisfactory.

1311
01:14:36,937 --> 01:14:41,442
Three addresses always inspire
confidence, even in tradesmen.

1312
01:14:41,544 --> 01:14:44,609
But what proof have I
of their authenticity?

1313
01:14:44,712 --> 01:14:47,580
I have carefully preserved
the Court Guides of the period.

1314
01:14:47,687 --> 01:14:49,955
They are open for your inspection,
Lady Bracknell.

1315
01:14:50,054 --> 01:14:54,046
I have known strange errors
in that publication.

1316
01:14:54,149 --> 01:14:58,555
Miss Cardew's family's solicitors
are Messrs. Markby, Markby and Markby.

1317
01:14:58,661 --> 01:15:01,442
Oh, Markby, Markby and Markby.

1318
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:04,474
A firm of the very highest position
in their profession.

1319
01:15:04,578 --> 01:15:06,999
I have also in my possession,
you will be pleased to hear,

1320
01:15:07,106 --> 01:15:09,952
certificates of Miss Cardew's
birth, baptism, whooping cough,

1321
01:15:10,050 --> 01:15:11,871
registration, vaccination,

1322
01:15:11,969 --> 01:15:16,953
confirmation and the measles...
the German and the English variety.

1323
01:15:17,056 --> 01:15:19,575
A life crowded with incident, I see.

1324
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:21,915
But somewhat too exciting
for a young girl.

1325
01:15:22,143 --> 01:15:26,451
- Gwendolen, the time approaches
for our departure.

1326
01:15:26,558 --> 01:15:28,859
We have not a moment to lose.

1327
01:15:29,853 --> 01:15:32,634
As a matter of form, Mr. Worthing,

1328
01:15:32,732 --> 01:15:36,244
I had better ask if Miss Cardew
has any little fortune.

1329
01:15:37,723 --> 01:15:43,351
Oh, only about 130,000 pounds
in the Funds. That is all.

1330
01:15:43,450 --> 01:15:46,231
Good-bye, Lady Bracknell.
So pleased to have seen you.

1331
01:15:46,330 --> 01:15:48,565
One moment, Mr. Worthing.

1332
01:15:49,721 --> 01:15:53,233
130,000 pounds, and in the Funds.

1333
01:15:53,336 --> 01:15:57,906
Miss Cardew seems a most attractive
young lady now that I look at her.

1334
01:15:58,007 --> 01:16:02,795
Few girls of the present day
have any really solid qualities...

1335
01:16:02,902 --> 01:16:06,162
qualities that last
and improve with time.

1336
01:16:06,261 --> 01:16:10,602
We live, I regret to say,
in an age of surfaces.

1337
01:16:10,708 --> 01:16:12,780
Come over here, dear.

1338
01:16:15,923 --> 01:16:17,832
Pretty child.

1339
01:16:17,938 --> 01:16:19,944
Your dress is sadly simple...

1340
01:16:20,050 --> 01:16:22,471
and your hair seems almost
as nature might have left it.

1341
01:16:22,577 --> 01:16:24,518
But we can soon alter that.

1342
01:16:24,625 --> 01:16:26,828
A thoroughly experienced
French maid...

1343
01:16:26,928 --> 01:16:31,117
produces a really remarkable result
in a very brief space of time.

1344
01:16:31,215 --> 01:16:34,410
There are distinct social possibilities
in your profile.

1345
01:16:34,511 --> 01:16:37,925
Cecily is the dearest, sweetest,
prettiest girl in the world.

1346
01:16:38,031 --> 01:16:41,194
And I don't care two pins
for social possibilities.

1347
01:16:41,293 --> 01:16:44,074
Never speak disrespectfully
of society, Algernon.

1348
01:16:44,173 --> 01:16:46,506
Only people who can't
get into it do that.

1349
01:16:46,604 --> 01:16:48,970
I suppose you know
that Algernon...

1350
01:16:49,068 --> 01:16:51,369
has nothing but his debts
to depend upon?

1351
01:16:51,468 --> 01:16:54,631
But I do not approve
of mercenary marriages.

1352
01:16:54,730 --> 01:16:58,274
When I married Lord Bracknell,
I had no fortune of any kind,

1353
01:16:58,378 --> 01:17:01,890
but I never dreamed
of allowing that to stand in my way.

1354
01:17:01,993 --> 01:17:05,308
Well, I suppose
I must give my consent.

1355
01:17:06,631 --> 01:17:09,826
- Thank you, Aunt Augusta.
- Cecily, you may kiss me.

1356
01:17:09,927 --> 01:17:12,381
Thank you, Lady Bracknell.

1357
01:17:12,486 --> 01:17:15,202
And you may address me
as Aunt Augusta for the future.

1358
01:17:15,302 --> 01:17:17,472
Thank you, Aunt Augusta.

1359
01:17:17,574 --> 01:17:20,093
The marriage, I think,
had better take place quite soon.

1360
01:17:20,197 --> 01:17:22,335
Thank you, Aunt Augusta.

1361
01:17:22,436 --> 01:17:27,519
To speak frankly,
I am not in favor of long engagements.

1362
01:17:27,619 --> 01:17:29,440
They give people an opportunity...

1363
01:17:29,539 --> 01:17:31,993
of finding out each other's characters
before marriage,

1364
01:17:32,098 --> 01:17:33,952
which I think is never advisable.

1365
01:17:34,050 --> 01:17:36,667
I beg your pardon
for interrupting you, Lady Bracknell,

1366
01:17:36,769 --> 01:17:39,135
but this engagement
is quite out of the question.

1367
01:17:39,232 --> 01:17:41,053
I am Miss Cardew's guardian,

1368
01:17:41,152 --> 01:17:43,485
and she cannot marry without my consent
until she comes of age.

1369
01:17:43,584 --> 01:17:46,518
That consent
I absolutely decline to give.

1370
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:48,761
Upon what grounds, may I ask?

1371
01:17:48,862 --> 01:17:51,163
Algernon is an extremely...

1372
01:17:51,262 --> 01:17:54,806
one might almost say ostentatiously...
eligible young man.

1373
01:17:54,909 --> 01:17:58,737
He has nothing and looks everything.
What more could one desire?

1374
01:17:58,844 --> 01:18:02,421
It pains me very much
to have to speak frankly to you,
Lady Bracknell, about your nephew,

1375
01:18:02,523 --> 01:18:05,489
but the fact is that I do not
approve at all of his moral character.

1376
01:18:05,594 --> 01:18:09,008
- I suspect him of being untruthful.
- Untruthful?

1377
01:18:09,113 --> 01:18:11,632
My nephew Algernon, untruthful?

1378
01:18:11,737 --> 01:18:14,736
Impossible.
He was at Oxford.

1379
01:18:16,312 --> 01:18:19,158
I fear there can be
no possible doubt about the matter.

1380
01:18:19,256 --> 01:18:22,222
This afternoon, during
my temporary absence in London...

1381
01:18:22,327 --> 01:18:25,708
on an important question
of... romance,

1382
01:18:25,814 --> 01:18:27,635
he obtained admission to my house...

1383
01:18:27,734 --> 01:18:30,286
by means of the false pretense
of being my brother.

1384
01:18:30,389 --> 01:18:34,282
Under an assumed name, he drank,
I have just been informed by my butler,

1385
01:18:34,388 --> 01:18:37,583
an entire pint bottle
of Perrier-Jouet, Brut '89,

1386
01:18:37,684 --> 01:18:40,138
a wine that I was specially
reserving for myself.

1387
01:18:40,243 --> 01:18:42,064
Continuing his disgraceful deception,

1388
01:18:42,162 --> 01:18:44,016
he succeeded, during the course
of the afternoon,

1389
01:18:44,114 --> 01:18:47,048
in alienating the affections
of my only ward.

1390
01:18:47,153 --> 01:18:50,185
He subsequently stayed to tea
and devoured every single muffin,

1391
01:18:50,288 --> 01:18:53,134
and what makes his conduct
all the more heartless
is that he was perfectly well aware...

1392
01:18:53,232 --> 01:18:56,100
from the first that I have no brother,
that I never had a brother...

1393
01:18:56,207 --> 01:18:59,239
and I don't intend to
have a brother... not even of any kind.

1394
01:18:59,342 --> 01:19:01,228
Mm-hmm!

1395
01:19:03,662 --> 01:19:08,036
Mr. Worthing,
after careful consideration,

1396
01:19:08,141 --> 01:19:12,929
I have decided entirely to overlook
my nephew's conduct towards you.

1397
01:19:13,036 --> 01:19:15,304
That is very generous of you,
Lady Bracknell.

1398
01:19:15,403 --> 01:19:18,020
My own decision, however,
is unalterable.

1399
01:19:18,122 --> 01:19:19,943
I decline to give my consent.

1400
01:19:21,386 --> 01:19:23,207
Come here, sweet child.

1401
01:19:25,833 --> 01:19:27,905
How old are you?

1402
01:19:28,009 --> 01:19:29,830
Well, I'm really only 18,

1403
01:19:29,928 --> 01:19:32,447
but I always admit to 20
when I go to evening parties.

1404
01:19:32,551 --> 01:19:36,030
You are perfectly right
to make some slight alteration.

1405
01:19:36,135 --> 01:19:39,069
A woman should never be
really accurate about her age.

1406
01:19:39,174 --> 01:19:41,377
It looks so calculating.

1407
01:19:41,477 --> 01:19:44,989
Eighteen, admitting to twenty
at evening parties.

1408
01:19:45,092 --> 01:19:49,793
Well, you will soon be of age and free
from the restraints of tutelage.

1409
01:19:49,891 --> 01:19:53,784
So I do not think your guardian's
consent is a matter of any importance.

1410
01:19:53,890 --> 01:19:57,685
Pray excuse me for interrupting you
once again, Lady Bracknell,
but I think it is only fair...

1411
01:19:57,794 --> 01:20:00,062
to point out that under the terms
of her grandfather's will,

1412
01:20:00,161 --> 01:20:02,615
Miss Cardew does not
legally come of age...

1413
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:05,337
until she is 35.

1414
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:08,755
That doesn't seem to me
to be a very grave objection.

1415
01:20:08,863 --> 01:20:11,579
Thirty-five is a very attractive age.

1416
01:20:11,678 --> 01:20:14,873
London society is full of women
of the highest birth...

1417
01:20:14,974 --> 01:20:18,650
who, of their own free choice,
have remained 35 for years.

1418
01:20:18,749 --> 01:20:20,821
Lady Dumbleton
is an instance in point.

1419
01:20:20,924 --> 01:20:25,429
To my own knowledge she's been 35
ever since she arrived at the age of 40,

1420
01:20:25,531 --> 01:20:27,864
which is many years ago now.

1421
01:20:27,963 --> 01:20:32,152
I see no reason why our dear Cecily
should not be even more attractive...

1422
01:20:32,250 --> 01:20:35,216
at the age you mention
than she is at present.

1423
01:20:35,321 --> 01:20:39,727
There will be a large accumulation
of property.

1424
01:20:39,832 --> 01:20:44,108
Algy, could you wait for me
till I was 35?

1425
01:20:45,302 --> 01:20:47,854
Of course I could, Cecily.
You know I could.

1426
01:20:47,958 --> 01:20:51,699
Yes, I felt that... instinctively.

1427
01:20:51,798 --> 01:20:54,001
But I couldn't wait all that time.

1428
01:20:54,101 --> 01:20:56,555
- But Cecily!
- My dear Mr. Worthing,

1429
01:20:56,661 --> 01:21:01,329
as Miss Cardew states positively
that she cannot wait until she is 35,

1430
01:21:01,427 --> 01:21:03,313
a remark which I am bound to say...

1431
01:21:03,411 --> 01:21:06,127
seems to me to show
a somewhat impatient nature,

1432
01:21:06,226 --> 01:21:08,559
I would beg of you
to reconsider your decision.

1433
01:21:08,658 --> 01:21:13,032
But, my dear Lady Bracknell, the matter
is entirely in your own hands.

1434
01:21:13,136 --> 01:21:15,502
The moment you consent
to my marriage with Gwendolen,

1435
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:19,789
I will most gladly allow your nephew
to form an alliance with my ward.

1436
01:21:19,887 --> 01:21:22,537
That is not the destiny
I propose for Gwendolen.

1437
01:21:22,638 --> 01:21:25,004
Algernon, of course,
can choose for himself.

1438
01:21:25,102 --> 01:21:29,410
Come, dear. We've already missed
five, if not six, trains.

1439
01:21:29,517 --> 01:21:33,160
To miss any more might expose us
to comment on the platform.

1440
01:21:34,252 --> 01:21:38,244
Uh, everything is quite ready
for the christenings.

1441
01:21:38,347 --> 01:21:40,648
The christenings, sir?

1442
01:21:40,747 --> 01:21:42,656
Is not this somewhat premature?

1443
01:21:42,762 --> 01:21:47,103
Both these gentlemen have expressed
their desire for immediate baptism.

1444
01:21:47,209 --> 01:21:49,215
At their age?

1445
01:21:49,321 --> 01:21:52,069
The idea is grotesque
and irreligious.

1446
01:21:52,168 --> 01:21:56,803
Algernon, I forbid you to be baptized.
I will not hear of such excesses.

1447
01:21:56,903 --> 01:22:00,251
Am I to understand
there are to be...

1448
01:22:00,359 --> 01:22:02,943
no christenings at all
this afternoon?

1449
01:22:03,045 --> 01:22:05,891
I don't think that
with things as they are, Dr. Chasuble,

1450
01:22:05,989 --> 01:22:09,337
they would be of much practical value
to either of us.

1451
01:22:09,444 --> 01:22:12,476
As your present mood seems to be
one peculiarly secular,

1452
01:22:12,580 --> 01:22:14,401
I will return to the church at once.

1453
01:22:14,499 --> 01:22:18,556
Indeed, I've just been informed
Miss Prism has been waiting for me.

1454
01:22:18,658 --> 01:22:21,024
Miss Prism?

1455
01:22:21,122 --> 01:22:24,798
Did I hear you mention a Miss Prism?

1456
01:22:24,897 --> 01:22:27,743
Yes, indeed.
I am on my way to join her.

1457
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:30,141
Kindly allow me to detain you
for one moment.

1458
01:22:30,239 --> 01:22:35,059
Is this Miss Prism
a female of repellent aspect...

1459
01:22:35,167 --> 01:22:37,817
remotely connected with education?

1460
01:22:37,918 --> 01:22:42,706
She is the most cultivated of ladies
and the very picture of respectability.

1461
01:22:42,813 --> 01:22:45,659
It is obviously the same person.

1462
01:22:45,756 --> 01:22:49,813
May I ask what is her position
in your household?

1463
01:22:51,419 --> 01:22:53,720
Miss Prism, Lady Bracknell,
has for the last three years been...

1464
01:22:53,818 --> 01:22:57,199
Miss Cardew's esteemed governess
and valued companion.

1465
01:22:57,305 --> 01:23:00,239
In spite of what I hear of her,
I must see her at once.

1466
01:23:00,345 --> 01:23:03,344
- Let her be sent for.
- Oh, she approaches.

1467
01:23:03,448 --> 01:23:05,749
She is nigh.

1468
01:23:05,847 --> 01:23:08,693
I was told you expected me
in the vestry, dear Canon.

1469
01:23:08,791 --> 01:23:12,139
I have been waiting for you there
for an hour and three-quarters.

1470
01:23:12,247 --> 01:23:14,864
Prism?

1471
01:23:16,565 --> 01:23:18,604
Come here, Prism.

1472
01:23:23,987 --> 01:23:26,571
Prism, where is that baby?

1473
01:23:29,298 --> 01:23:33,672
Twenty-eight years ago, Prism,
you left Lord Bracknell's house...

1474
01:23:33,777 --> 01:23:38,085
in charge of a perambulator
containing an infant of the male sex.

1475
01:23:38,192 --> 01:23:40,908
You never returned.

1476
01:23:41,008 --> 01:23:45,643
Some few weeks later, the perambulator
was discovered at midnight...

1477
01:23:45,742 --> 01:23:51,239
standing by itself
in a remote corner of Bayswater.

1478
01:23:51,342 --> 01:23:54,919
It contained the manuscript
of a three-volume novel...

1479
01:23:55,021 --> 01:23:58,086
of more than
usually revolting sentimentality.

1480
01:23:58,188 --> 01:24:01,864
- Ohh.
- But the baby was not there.

1481
01:24:01,963 --> 01:24:05,158
Prism, where is that baby?

1482
01:24:07,114 --> 01:24:09,960
Where is that baby, Prism?

1483
01:24:12,681 --> 01:24:18,146
Lady Bracknell, I admit with shame
that I do not know.

1484
01:24:18,247 --> 01:24:21,213
I only wish I did.

1485
01:24:21,319 --> 01:24:24,514
The plain facts of the case
are these:

1486
01:24:24,614 --> 01:24:26,718
On the morning
of the day you mention,

1487
01:24:26,821 --> 01:24:29,886
a day that is forever branded
on my memory,

1488
01:24:29,989 --> 01:24:33,948
I prepared as usual to take
the baby out in its perambulator.

1489
01:24:34,052 --> 01:24:38,687
I had also with me a somewhat old
but capacious handbag...

1490
01:24:38,787 --> 01:24:42,779
in which I had intended to place
the manuscript of a work of fiction...

1491
01:24:42,882 --> 01:24:45,816
that I had written during
my few unoccupied hours.

1492
01:24:45,921 --> 01:24:49,880
In a moment of mental abstraction,
for which I never can forgive myself,

1493
01:24:49,985 --> 01:24:53,180
I deposited the manuscript
in the bassinet...

1494
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:56,377
and placed the baby
in the handbag.

1495
01:24:56,479 --> 01:24:59,773
- But where did you deposit the handbag?
- Do not ask me, Mr. Worthing.

1496
01:24:59,870 --> 01:25:01,691
Miss Prism, this is a matter
of no small importance to me.

1497
01:25:01,790 --> 01:25:04,156
I insist on knowing where you deposited
the handbag that contained that infant!

1498
01:25:04,253 --> 01:25:07,547
I left it in the cloakroom of one of
the larger railway stations in London.

1499
01:25:07,644 --> 01:25:10,709
What railway station?

1500
01:25:10,811 --> 01:25:12,337
Victoria.

1501
01:25:15,514 --> 01:25:18,098
The Brighton line?

1502
01:25:18,202 --> 01:25:20,689
The Brighton line.

1503
01:25:23,961 --> 01:25:29,229
- Gwendolen, wait here for me.
- If you are not too long,
I will wait here for you all my life.

1504
01:25:50,707 --> 01:25:53,073
This suspense is terrible.

1505
01:25:55,858 --> 01:25:58,159
- Miss Prism, is this the handbag?
- Let me look.

1506
01:25:59,409 --> 01:26:01,415
Examine it carefully
before you speak.

1507
01:26:01,521 --> 01:26:04,520
The happiness of more than one life
depends on your answer.

1508
01:26:04,624 --> 01:26:06,728
Thank you.

1509
01:26:06,831 --> 01:26:08,652
It seems to be mine.

1510
01:26:08,750 --> 01:26:10,822
Oh, yes! Here is the injury
it received...

1511
01:26:10,926 --> 01:26:13,030
through the upsetting of
a Gower Street omnibus...

1512
01:26:13,134 --> 01:26:15,043
in younger and happier days.

1513
01:26:16,845 --> 01:26:18,819
Here is the stain on the lining...

1514
01:26:18,925 --> 01:26:21,128
caused by the explosion
of a temperance beverage,

1515
01:26:21,228 --> 01:26:23,332
an incident that occurred
at Leamington.

1516
01:26:23,436 --> 01:26:26,118
And here on the lock are my initials.

1517
01:26:26,219 --> 01:26:29,447
I had forgotten that in an extravagant
mood I had had them placed there.

1518
01:26:29,546 --> 01:26:31,367
The bag is undoubtedly mine.

1519
01:26:31,466 --> 01:26:33,887
I am delighted to have it
so unexpectedly restored to me.

1520
01:26:33,993 --> 01:26:36,861
It has been a great inconvenience
being without it all these years.

1521
01:26:36,969 --> 01:26:39,651
Miss Prism,

1522
01:26:39,752 --> 01:26:42,053
more is restored to you
than the handbag.

1523
01:26:43,527 --> 01:26:46,014
I am the baby
that was placed in it.

1524
01:26:47,398 --> 01:26:50,692
- You?
- Yes... Mother!

1525
01:26:50,789 --> 01:26:53,090
Mr. Worthing, I am unmarried!

1526
01:26:54,532 --> 01:26:56,506
Unmarried?

1527
01:26:56,612 --> 01:26:59,131
L-I do not deny that
that is a serious blow,

1528
01:26:59,236 --> 01:27:02,944
but who has the right to cast a stone
against one who has suffered?

1529
01:27:03,043 --> 01:27:05,246
Cannot repentance wipe out
an act of folly?

1530
01:27:05,346 --> 01:27:08,094
Why should there be one law for men
and another for women?

1531
01:27:08,194 --> 01:27:10,200
Mother, I forgive you.

1532
01:27:10,305 --> 01:27:13,053
Mr. Worthing, there is some error!

1533
01:27:13,153 --> 01:27:16,567
There is the lady who can tell you
who you really are. Oh, dear.

1534
01:27:18,144 --> 01:27:21,459
Lady Bracknell,
I hate to seem inquisitive,

1535
01:27:21,567 --> 01:27:25,624
but could you kindly inform me
who I really am?

1536
01:27:25,726 --> 01:27:29,980
You are the son of my poor sister,
Mrs. Moncrieff,

1537
01:27:30,077 --> 01:27:33,272
and, consequently,
Algernon's elder brother.

1538
01:27:34,876 --> 01:27:39,315
Algy's elder brother?
Then I have a brother after all.

1539
01:27:39,419 --> 01:27:41,360
I knew I had a brother.
I always said I had a brother.

1540
01:27:41,466 --> 01:27:43,538
Cecily, how could you ever have
doubted that I had a brother?

1541
01:27:43,642 --> 01:27:47,383
Dr. Chasuble, my unfortunate brother.
Miss Prism, my unfortunate brother.

1542
01:27:47,481 --> 01:27:49,585
Gwendolen, my unfortunate brother.

1543
01:27:49,688 --> 01:27:52,556
Algy, you young scoundrel,
you will have to behave
with more respect to me in the future.

1544
01:27:52,663 --> 01:27:54,931
You've never behaved to me
like a brother in all your life.

1545
01:27:55,032 --> 01:27:58,511
Not till today, I admit.
I tried my best, however,
though I was out of practice.

1546
01:27:58,615 --> 01:28:02,291
My own!
But what "own" are you?

1547
01:28:02,390 --> 01:28:05,455
What is your Christian name
now that you've become someone else?

1548
01:28:05,557 --> 01:28:08,752
Your decision on the subject
of my Christian name
is irrevocable, I suppose.

1549
01:28:08,852 --> 01:28:11,371
I never change,
except in my affections.

1550
01:28:11,475 --> 01:28:13,841
What a noble nature
you have, Gwendolen.

1551
01:28:13,939 --> 01:28:16,687
Then the question must be
cleared up once and for all.

1552
01:28:16,786 --> 01:28:20,494
Aunt Augusta, at the time when
Miss Prism left me in the handbag,

1553
01:28:20,594 --> 01:28:22,415
had I been christened already?

1554
01:28:22,513 --> 01:28:26,767
Every luxury that money could buy,
including christening,

1555
01:28:26,864 --> 01:28:30,343
had been lavished on you
by your fond and doting parents.

1556
01:28:30,447 --> 01:28:32,934
Then I was christened.
That is settled.

1557
01:28:33,039 --> 01:28:36,169
Now, what was my Christian name?
Let me know the worst.

1558
01:28:36,270 --> 01:28:40,425
Being the eldest son, you were
naturally called after your father.

1559
01:28:40,525 --> 01:28:43,785
Yes, but what was
my father's Christian name?

1560
01:28:43,884 --> 01:28:47,625
I cannot at the moment recall
what the general's Christian name was.

1561
01:28:47,723 --> 01:28:49,664
I've no doubt he had one.

1562
01:28:49,771 --> 01:28:53,031
He was eccentric, I admit,
but only in later years.

1563
01:28:53,130 --> 01:28:55,333
Algy, can't you recollect
what our father's Christian name was?

1564
01:28:55,434 --> 01:28:57,572
My dear boy, we were never
even on speaking terms.

1565
01:28:57,673 --> 01:28:59,582
He died before I was a year old.

1566
01:28:59,977 --> 01:29:03,172
His name would be in the army lists
of the period, I suppose, Aunt Augusta?

1567
01:29:03,272 --> 01:29:07,548
The general was essentially a man
of peace, except in his domestic life,

1568
01:29:07,655 --> 01:29:11,265
but I've no doubt his name
would appear in any military directory.

1569
01:29:16,965 --> 01:29:20,673
The army lists
of the last 40 years are here.

1570
01:29:20,772 --> 01:29:23,520
These delightful records
should have been my constant study.

1571
01:29:23,620 --> 01:29:26,783
M, generals.

1572
01:29:29,218 --> 01:29:34,781
"Magley," "Maxby,"
"Maxbohm"...what ghastly names!

1573
01:29:34,881 --> 01:29:39,003
"Markly," "Migsby," "Mobbs."

1574
01:29:39,104 --> 01:29:42,452
"Moncrieff." Lieutenant, 1840.

1575
01:29:42,559 --> 01:29:45,046
Captain, lieutenant colonel,
colonel, general, 1869.

1576
01:29:45,151 --> 01:29:47,354
Christian name...

1577
01:29:49,246 --> 01:29:51,612
Ernest John.

1578
01:29:54,045 --> 01:29:58,102
Gwendolen, I always told you
that my name was Ernest, didn't I?

1579
01:29:58,203 --> 01:30:01,017
Ernest, my own Ernest.

1580
01:30:01,115 --> 01:30:04,081
Cecily, at last.

1581
01:30:04,187 --> 01:30:06,935
Laetitia, at last.

1582
01:30:07,033 --> 01:30:08,919
Gwendolen, at last.

1583
01:30:09,017 --> 01:30:14,198
My nephew? You seem to be
displaying signs of triviality.

1584
01:30:14,296 --> 01:30:16,117
On the contrary, Aunt Augusta.

1585
01:30:16,216 --> 01:30:18,898
I have now realized
for the first time in my life...

1586
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:22,643
the vital importance
of being earnest.
