1
00:00:12,687 --> 00:00:15,392
Who knows, who knows

2
00:00:15,857 --> 00:00:18,941
Who knows which way is the right way goes

3
00:00:18,941 --> 00:00:21,946
The night is dark and the way is far

4
00:00:21,946 --> 00:00:24,735
for a man without a star.

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,609
Who knows, who knows

6
00:00:28,453 --> 00:00:31,407
Who knows which way a whirlwind blows

7
00:00:31,442 --> 00:00:34,328
Or where the trail of tomorrow goes

8
00:00:34,328 --> 00:00:37,420
For a man without a star

9
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,890
It's just no sense to build and fence

10
00:00:40,892 --> 00:00:43,754
Not if you like to wander.

11
00:00:44,262 --> 00:00:46,800
Each hill I see is colony

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,093
Go yonder, yonder, yonder

13
00:00:50,352 --> 00:00:53,222
Who knows, who knows?

14
00:00:53,322 --> 00:00:56,781
Was I right, was I wrong the way I chose

15
00:00:56,881 --> 00:00:59,425
The night is dark the way is far

16
00:00:59,525 --> 00:01:03,139
for a man without a star.

17
00:01:09,498 --> 00:01:12,119
The night is dark and the way is far

18
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:15,993
for a man without a star.

19
00:01:16,755 --> 00:01:27,769
For a man without a star.

20
00:02:17,174 --> 00:02:18,378
Come on, out of there!

21
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,736
Come on, hurry it up!

22
00:02:24,328 --> 00:02:25,573
Now, hit the road.

23
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:31,995
- Road? What road?
- That's for you to worry about.

24
00:02:32,336 --> 00:02:35,586
Well, a man could starve
before he ever found a house.

25
00:02:35,786 --> 00:02:37,715
Well, that's something else
you gonna worry about.

26
00:02:37,815 --> 00:02:39,676
- Now come on, move along.
- Don't do that.

27
00:02:39,776 --> 00:02:40,692
Why you ...!

28
00:02:43,457 --> 00:02:44,972
Hmm, that's on me.

29
00:03:10,085 --> 00:03:11,780
Wrong man, kid.

30
00:03:32,468 --> 00:03:33,896
- Thanks.
- For what?

31
00:03:33,996 --> 00:03:36,739
- I was under the wheel.
- You asked for it.

32
00:03:36,839 --> 00:03:39,431
When you throw a punch
don't turn your back.

33
00:03:46,249 --> 00:03:49,569
Hey, that's a good looking
saddle you got there.

34
00:03:52,714 --> 00:03:54,042
Single rigging?

35
00:03:55,842 --> 00:03:58,002
Yep, California style.

36
00:03:58,846 --> 00:04:00,720
Me, I ride a Brazos double.

37
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:05,510
Double rig is better for rope.
That's why I do most of the rope.

38
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:10,522
- That's why I use a Brazos double rig.
- This is a Brazos double rig.

39
00:04:11,092 --> 00:04:15,520
- Are you saying I'm a liar?
- You're saying it, kid. I ain't.

40
00:04:18,575 --> 00:04:20,335
Alright, I was talking big.

41
00:04:21,077 --> 00:04:23,866
I never did rope,
I never got the chance.

42
00:04:24,207 --> 00:04:27,457
Always wanted to work cattle,
folks wouldn't let me go west.

43
00:04:27,557 --> 00:04:29,418
Went off on your own, huh?

44
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,538
- You work cattle?
- Uh huh.

45
00:04:33,608 --> 00:04:35,267
Why ain't you on a horse?

46
00:04:37,429 --> 00:04:40,430
Ever tried riding from
Kansas City to Wyoming?

47
00:04:42,726 --> 00:04:45,151
Ayy, good old Kansas City.

48
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:48,656
Good food, good liquor
and good looking women.

49
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:51,734
- Have you been to Kansas City?
- I was born there.

50
00:04:52,111 --> 00:04:55,231
With all them good looking
women, why did you leave?

51
00:04:55,657 --> 00:04:56,819
Why did you leave?

52
00:04:57,867 --> 00:05:01,568
- I ran out of money.
- You still got your saddle.

53
00:05:02,455 --> 00:05:04,014
Never sell that, kid.

54
00:05:05,167 --> 00:05:08,536
Sitting another man's leather is
like wearing another man's boots.

55
00:05:08,636 --> 00:05:10,555
Never sell your saddle.

56
00:05:45,127 --> 00:05:46,241
Come up out of there!

57
00:05:46,711 --> 00:05:49,037
- Come down and get me!
- Or maybe you think I won't?

58
00:05:49,137 --> 00:05:51,622
All right, bud,
just hold your temper.

59
00:06:05,314 --> 00:06:08,665
- Have you got the makin's?
- I got the what?

60
00:06:09,444 --> 00:06:10,903
You answered me.

61
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,635
What are we doing, now?

62
00:06:34,262 --> 00:06:36,136
Let's get some sleep, kid.

63
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,962
Look.  Don't call me "kid",
my name's Jeff.

64
00:06:40,963 --> 00:06:42,211
All right.

65
00:06:43,522 --> 00:06:45,116
Get some sleep, Jeffrey.

66
00:06:45,983 --> 00:06:48,604
Real pretty name, Jeffrey,
Real pretty.

67
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:32,103
Wake up, kid,
Time to go.

68
00:07:33,576 --> 00:07:35,818
- Thanks for the loan of the coat.
- What coat?

69
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:37,554
The one you got on.

70
00:07:37,872 --> 00:07:41,490
- I woke up last night.
- You sure dream pretty dreams.

71
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,493
- Canter through light rug.
- Do what?

72
00:07:47,757 --> 00:07:49,417
Do like I do.

73
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:57,262
Now watch me!

74
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:11,189
- Stay right where you are.
- I didn't do nothing.

75
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,152
Anybody say you did?

76
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:19,037
Why don't you lower the hammer?
We got no guns.

77
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,169
Tom, bring them down here!

78
00:08:35,684 --> 00:08:37,142
- Is that all of them?
- Looks like.

79
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:39,220
All right, line up here.
Line up.

80
00:08:41,231 --> 00:08:44,385
All right boys,
which one of you did it?

81
00:08:45,611 --> 00:08:46,525
Did what?

82
00:08:47,947 --> 00:08:50,070
- How did you get that?
- At a fight.

83
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,190
Who with?

84
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,302
With the brakeman. He
wanted to put me off back there.

85
00:08:54,303 --> 00:08:55,318
And so you killed him.

86
00:08:55,319 --> 00:08:57,585
And I collect the reward because
I'm the one that turned him out.

87
00:08:57,586 --> 00:08:59,519
Now ain't you the lucky one.

88
00:09:00,502 --> 00:09:04,037
Never hanged a man as young as
you son, I hope I'd never have to.

89
00:09:04,423 --> 00:09:06,996
- Bring him in.
- Now, wait a minute.

90
00:09:07,096 --> 00:09:09,333
- I didn't do it.
- Who did?

91
00:09:14,768 --> 00:09:17,044
- I don't know.
- I do.

92
00:09:17,729 --> 00:09:19,437
They wired ahead about the killing, huh?

93
00:09:19,548 --> 00:09:20,236
Yup

94
00:09:20,237 --> 00:09:22,298
They happen to say the
brakeman got caught up.

95
00:09:22,634 --> 00:09:24,222
Come to think of it, they did.

96
00:09:24,423 --> 00:09:25,736
The kid's got no knife.

97
00:09:25,771 --> 00:09:26,601
He threw it away.

98
00:09:26,602 --> 00:09:28,684
You ought to know better
a knife and never does that.

99
00:09:29,449 --> 00:09:31,608
- Ask him.
- Why me?

100
00:09:32,478 --> 00:09:35,233
Come on, you did
the cut and I saw it.

101
00:09:35,622 --> 00:09:39,508
So did he. Now he's stupid enough to
hang for something another man done.

102
00:09:47,302 --> 00:09:50,506
You had your gun clear
the leather all the time.

103
00:09:50,722 --> 00:09:52,181
Take him to the jailhouse.

104
00:09:52,281 --> 00:09:55,683
And notify the railroad. We're claiming
that hundred dollars reward.

105
00:09:55,936 --> 00:09:58,558
Now you boys either get
jobs or get out of town.

106
00:09:58,658 --> 00:10:00,413
Without my hundred dollars?

107
00:10:00,814 --> 00:10:03,188
Make it 50, you got a deal.

108
00:10:03,223 --> 00:10:05,926
- The rest goes to the deputies.
- Okay.

109
00:10:06,865 --> 00:10:08,792
It takes a day or two to collect.

110
00:10:09,284 --> 00:10:12,155
- I wouldn't wait for that 50.
- No?

111
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:15,034
I'd ride this out
of town if I was you.

112
00:10:15,134 --> 00:10:16,885
You ain't me.

113
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:26,439
Well I, guess I got
to thank you again.

114
00:10:26,552 --> 00:10:30,287
- For what?
- Well, you kept me from getting hung.

115
00:10:32,976 --> 00:10:35,116
You can get hung
any day you want.

116
00:10:35,521 --> 00:10:38,787
As long as you don't stop
me from getting my $ 50.

117
00:10:54,081 --> 00:10:58,116
Now don't you do like the man said
and ride that train out of town. Huh?

118
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,598
Hey what do you think you trying
to do, breaking up my piano?

119
00:11:36,698 --> 00:11:38,158
Well, it's worth $ 50.

120
00:11:38,421 --> 00:11:42,186
- It's worth a whole lot more than that.
- I was talking about the saddle.

121
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,786
I don't care what you are talking about,
just haul that saddle out of here.

122
00:11:47,013 --> 00:11:50,051
- Dempsey Rae!
- Idonee!

123
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:56,326
You're a pretty as an Indian
blanket and twice as comfortable.

124
00:11:56,441 --> 00:12:00,040
- Especially on a cold night.
- Breaking up my piano.

125
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:02,938
Another stray cat
that needs a bowl of milk.

126
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,485
- "Meow".
- Forget those cats.

127
00:12:05,486 --> 00:12:08,080
- What are you doing here in Wyoming?
- Just drifting through.

128
00:12:08,084 --> 00:12:11,096
Now just drifting, hmm?
You haven't changed a bit.

129
00:12:11,206 --> 00:12:14,240
Hey, strong man,
don't I know you?

130
00:12:14,242 --> 00:12:18,200
No, but I know you
Moccasin Mary, from Tucumcari

131
00:12:18,203 --> 00:12:20,870
just a rock exterior
with a heart of stone.

132
00:12:20,872 --> 00:12:22,509
Find your own man.

133
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:31,721
How about a loan,
understand $ 25?

134
00:12:32,938 --> 00:12:34,729
You sure haven't changed.

135
00:12:42,197 --> 00:12:43,913
Here's your end, kid.

136
00:12:44,534 --> 00:12:45,696
Be happy.

137
00:12:46,077 --> 00:12:49,090
- Hey, that's hard earned money?
- Simmer down, honey.

138
00:12:49,095 --> 00:12:52,060
- I got $ 50 coming real quick.
- Fifty dollars?

139
00:12:52,068 --> 00:12:55,290
- You can drink that up in one night.
- Well, let's do.

140
00:12:55,292 --> 00:12:58,210
- First things come first.
- Like what?

141
00:12:58,214 --> 00:13:02,745
Like soap and water,
you smell like a goat.

142
00:13:12,522 --> 00:13:15,213
- You decent?
- That's debatable.

143
00:13:16,735 --> 00:13:18,595
Hey, thanks for washing my shirt.

144
00:13:20,322 --> 00:13:21,315
How do I look?

145
00:13:21,318 --> 00:13:24,959
Oh honey, you look real pretty.

146
00:13:25,077 --> 00:13:27,846
But you I can't let you
go out of here half naked.

147
00:13:36,548 --> 00:13:38,375
Try this for size.

148
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,591
- Where did you get it?
- A fella left it on account.

149
00:13:44,832 --> 00:13:45,963
On account of what?

150
00:13:45,964 --> 00:13:49,204
On account, the same
reason you left your saddle.

151
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:50,436
He was hungry.

152
00:14:00,614 --> 00:14:03,984
- A bottle of good and two clean glasses.
- They gotta to be cleaned?

153
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,943
Don't try the impossible, Duckbill.

154
00:14:06,945 --> 00:14:09,030
- Just set out the whiskey.
- Yes, ma'am.

155
00:14:09,031 --> 00:14:11,697
Well hello, boy.
What brings you into town?

156
00:14:11,699 --> 00:14:14,960
Just brought in 400 steers for shipment.
Finally got them loaded.

157
00:14:14,961 --> 00:14:16,360
Here's your whiskey,
where's your money?

158
00:14:16,361 --> 00:14:17,535
Put it on my tab.

159
00:14:17,538 --> 00:14:19,441
- All right.
- Demp, hey Demp.

160
00:14:19,844 --> 00:14:23,110
I want you to meet Strap Davis,
foreman down on the Triangle.

161
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:25,712
It's a big spread, used
to belong to old man Simpson.

162
00:14:25,714 --> 00:14:26,971
Not anymore, it don't.

163
00:14:27,602 --> 00:14:30,936
Can't you keep shut up till
I get these men introduced?

164
00:14:32,816 --> 00:14:34,014
Have a drink, friend.

165
00:14:34,234 --> 00:14:37,401
- What kind of a spread you got?
- Oh right about ten thousand heads.

166
00:14:38,364 --> 00:14:39,591
Ten thousand heads?

167
00:14:39,592 --> 00:14:42,217
I thought I was
doing good with 800.

168
00:14:42,326 --> 00:14:45,760
You fellas on the Triangle ain't
leaving much grass for the rest of us.

169
00:14:45,871 --> 00:14:48,327
It's open range.
Don't blame me.

170
00:14:48,362 --> 00:14:49,870
I ain't blaming you, Strap.

171
00:14:50,168 --> 00:14:52,125
But I am blaming your new owner.

172
00:14:52,136 --> 00:14:54,646
Why don't he come out from
the east to look things over

173
00:14:54,647 --> 00:14:56,000
before he builds up the herd?

174
00:14:56,086 --> 00:14:58,714
From what I hear, he
ain't even seen the Triangle.

175
00:14:58,728 --> 00:15:01,002
He's coming out as soon as
we get the ranch house rebuilt.

176
00:15:01,004 --> 00:15:04,440
You know what we're putting in?
A bathroom ... right in the house.

177
00:15:04,475 --> 00:15:05,786
In the house?

178
00:15:05,935 --> 00:15:09,767
Inside the house!
Well, that ain't decent.

179
00:15:10,356 --> 00:15:13,108
Only someone from the
East could have think of that.

180
00:15:13,651 --> 00:15:15,974
Mighty handy on a rainy night.

181
00:15:25,456 --> 00:15:26,952
What is it?

182
00:15:30,419 --> 00:15:32,729
Give me a stick and I'll kill it.

183
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,821
He is coming at me!

184
00:15:38,511 --> 00:15:41,344
Why, it's my old
partner, the ropin' kid.

185
00:15:41,346 --> 00:15:43,108
Come on in, kid.

186
00:15:43,349 --> 00:15:44,992
Why, step up partner
and meet my friends.

187
00:15:45,192 --> 00:15:46,433
- You know Idonee.
- Hi.

188
00:15:46,435 --> 00:15:48,180
- Strap Davis and this is...

189
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:51,024
Hey, we never did get to know one
another. I am Dempsey Rae, Los Pecos.

190
00:15:51,025 --> 00:15:52,355
They are not worth knowing.

191
00:15:52,455 --> 00:15:54,933
Tom Cassidy, owner of
Circle C upon Little Rae.

192
00:15:54,934 --> 00:15:58,647
I am Mark Toliver, Ben Johnson and
me, we got small outfit over there too.

193
00:15:58,747 --> 00:16:00,860
- Gooder and Jessep.
- Good to know all of you.

194
00:16:00,864 --> 00:16:04,653
- And like I said, this is the ropin' kid.
- Hey, kid.

195
00:16:04,654 --> 00:16:06,888
Here you are ropin' kid,
take it down.

196
00:16:08,752 --> 00:16:10,050
Sarsaparilla.

197
00:16:10,921 --> 00:16:14,085
- I want to get some whiskey.
- Not with me, you don't.

198
00:16:14,088 --> 00:16:18,420
- Hallelujah!
- Here, drink this.

199
00:16:18,422 --> 00:16:21,266
You keep away from whiskey and
you'll have no regrets in the morning.

200
00:16:21,933 --> 00:16:23,561
Man's word is wisdom.

201
00:16:23,768 --> 00:16:25,760
- Demp!
- Yeah?

202
00:16:25,761 --> 00:16:28,517
- Look at here.
- Well I'll be.

203
00:16:47,027 --> 00:16:49,266
I thought I told
you to get out of town.

204
00:16:51,131 --> 00:16:53,669
- If I don't?
- I'll run you out.

205
00:16:56,344 --> 00:16:57,543
Why you ...

206
00:16:59,139 --> 00:17:01,132
Stuff all over my new outfit.

207
00:17:01,516 --> 00:17:03,639
Why, I'll kill you, you dirty ...

208
00:17:07,982 --> 00:17:10,056
You're mighty anxious with that gun.

209
00:17:15,073 --> 00:17:16,933
Now I'm going to give
you a chance to use it.

210
00:17:26,043 --> 00:17:27,025
Go ahead.

211
00:17:28,045 --> 00:17:29,407
Make your play.

212
00:17:33,885 --> 00:17:36,059
Alright boys, relax, both of you.

213
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,553
You fixing to kill my deputy?

214
00:17:43,555 --> 00:17:45,087
Sheriff, this man of yours

215
00:17:45,088 --> 00:17:48,113
is real gun crazy man when
he faces up a boy without a gun,

216
00:17:48,115 --> 00:17:51,210
but somehow he ain't so anxious
when he meets a man who has one.

217
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:55,311
- She's telling you the truth.
- I know, it's a habit of hers.

218
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:58,191
You get on back to the office,
I wanna have a talk with you.

219
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:01,324
Here's your 50, if you haven't
got a job, get out of town.

220
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:04,367
- He's got a job.
- Where? In the Triangle?

221
00:18:04,369 --> 00:18:07,957
Why not?
Strap is real partial to Texas men.

222
00:18:07,959 --> 00:18:09,801
I'd rather have him with me than against me.

223
00:18:09,802 --> 00:18:12,341
Me too.  Come on, sheriff,
step up and have a drink.

224
00:18:12,542 --> 00:18:14,426
How about you, son,
got yourself a job?

225
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:18,986
Have I, mister?
I'm from Texas.

226
00:18:19,642 --> 00:18:23,292
- What part of Texas?
- Down the Texas river.

227
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:28,310
Real pretty country on the
Texas river, I've been there.

228
00:18:28,311 --> 00:18:31,539
Now he's my partner, Strap.
I can't work without him.

229
00:18:32,614 --> 00:18:34,458
Okay, you're on.

230
00:18:34,742 --> 00:18:36,550
$ 30 a month and found.

231
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,870
Let's all have a drink, everybody!

232
00:18:38,871 --> 00:18:41,160
Lot's of whiskey and sarsaparilla.

233
00:18:41,582 --> 00:18:44,868
Last time I'm gray wolf and
tonight's my night to howl.

234
00:18:47,088 --> 00:18:49,795
He'll never get that saddle up ...

235
00:18:51,426 --> 00:18:53,185
Sarsaparilla!

236
00:19:01,187 --> 00:19:04,057
Stay away from whiskey,
you will no regrets in the morning.

237
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,190
That is what the man said,
and them words of wisdom.

238
00:19:07,192 --> 00:19:12,188
Don't give me no trouble, Texan,
it's the sarsaparilla that done it.

239
00:19:20,624 --> 00:19:22,831
All these cattle
belong to the Triangle?

240
00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:27,801
- All these and 8,000 more just like 'em.
- Gosh almighty.

241
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,224
Let's go, Demp.

242
00:19:57,297 --> 00:19:58,646
Put them in there.

243
00:20:06,865 --> 00:20:07,961
Hey Demp.

244
00:20:08,216 --> 00:20:10,967
Last night a fella told me
to stay away from whiskey,

245
00:20:10,969 --> 00:20:13,643
and have no regrets in the morning.

246
00:20:19,045 --> 00:20:21,967
Them still words of
wisdom, believe me.

247
00:20:26,695 --> 00:20:28,655
Let's eat, I'm hungry.

248
00:20:29,656 --> 00:20:31,649
So is he, and he comes first.

249
00:20:32,951 --> 00:20:34,247
Get over, boy.

250
00:20:45,215 --> 00:20:47,207
Come and get it!

251
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:01,971
Hey, did Strap say that...?

252
00:21:02,232 --> 00:21:04,559
- It's in the house?
- That's what he said.

253
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:12,059
Hey Strap.

254
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,645
- When do I get to see it?
- After we eat.

255
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:22,520
Inside the house, I wonder what
kind of people live back East.

256
00:21:25,324 --> 00:21:27,430
What, ain't this
good enough for you?

257
00:21:27,432 --> 00:21:30,240
Emma like said he'll look at my
pony, I think he dropped a shoe.

258
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:38,485
- A couple of new hands, men.
- You'll be sorry!

259
00:21:48,574 --> 00:21:50,583
You got no manners!
I ain't took yet.

260
00:21:51,202 --> 00:21:52,796
You could have
spoke without hitting.

261
00:21:55,206 --> 00:21:58,076
What do you think you're ...?
Stand up!

262
00:21:58,502 --> 00:22:01,537
- Why you little ...
- Do that outside.

263
00:22:01,838 --> 00:22:02,887
All right.

264
00:22:07,428 --> 00:22:08,458
Oh no, you don't!

265
00:22:08,459 --> 00:22:10,497
Eat it or leave it, sit down!

266
00:22:18,814 --> 00:22:21,719
- 2 dollars says Lodagal comes in first.
- You got a bet.

267
00:22:25,739 --> 00:22:27,731
Any other big spreads
like this around here?

268
00:22:27,732 --> 00:22:31,075
No, Cassidy, Toliver Johnson,
you met them last night.

269
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,245
They run a thousand head or less.

270
00:22:33,581 --> 00:22:35,109
They're up north on Little River.

271
00:22:36,667 --> 00:22:39,752
- Real nice country, eh.
- You gonna see more of it tomorrow.

272
00:22:40,004 --> 00:22:41,378
We got a small herd up there.

273
00:22:41,379 --> 00:22:43,823
I want you drive them
over towards Blue Lake.

274
00:22:55,755 --> 00:22:57,353
Now that's two bucks you owe me.

275
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:36,352
Hey, wrong man, Texas.

276
00:23:43,698 --> 00:23:47,281
Abut them cattle, you'll find them
scattered all over the low ground.

277
00:23:47,577 --> 00:23:50,249
Tomorrow drift them over toward
Blue Lake, it's over this way.

278
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:52,114
We don't want to meet
in over Cassidy's grass.

279
00:23:52,115 --> 00:23:55,952
Cassidy's grass.
I thought this is open range.

280
00:23:55,975 --> 00:23:58,245
It is.  But we like
to keep it friendly.

281
00:23:59,172 --> 00:23:59,919
Hey ya.

282
00:24:03,243 --> 00:24:05,121
Could we get to see it?

283
00:24:06,638 --> 00:24:07,668
Come on.

284
00:24:09,809 --> 00:24:11,437
You better stay here.

285
00:24:27,244 --> 00:24:28,642
Ah, ah.
On the paper.

286
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:34,422
In there.

287
00:24:41,768 --> 00:24:44,410
There's another door there
that goes to the bedroom.

288
00:24:46,389 --> 00:24:48,048
That's right handy.

289
00:24:54,147 --> 00:24:55,991
So now you've seen it, satisfied?

290
00:24:56,441 --> 00:24:59,179
Now, I don't want to
see the man that uses it.

291
00:25:10,332 --> 00:25:12,989
Hey Tex, bring that
old gal down here.

292
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:41,748
No running Tex, took a lot of
good grass to make that beef.

293
00:25:43,784 --> 00:25:46,820
Mostly, if you let the
horse alone, he'll do it right.

294
00:26:18,738 --> 00:26:21,181
Make up your rope,
could be you want to use it.

295
00:26:21,366 --> 00:26:24,865
When do I get use it?

296
00:26:24,866 --> 00:26:27,194
- Soon as we spot a maverick.
- A what?

297
00:26:27,195 --> 00:26:29,448
A maverick,
a calf with no mother.

298
00:26:29,449 --> 00:26:31,498
- No brand either.
- Why not?

299
00:26:31,499 --> 00:26:34,050
One in the county was
misted around at that time,

300
00:26:34,058 --> 00:26:36,253
outgrew its mother and wandered off.

301
00:26:36,549 --> 00:26:38,008
Sort of like you.

302
00:26:38,676 --> 00:26:40,952
That's better,
Hey there, come on.

303
00:26:51,432 --> 00:26:52,463
Hey Demp!

304
00:26:58,531 --> 00:27:00,291
Cassidy's place, I guess.

305
00:27:00,741 --> 00:27:04,293
- Then maybe we can stop by and eat.
- Think they'll feed us?

306
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:08,206
- Man, am I hungry.
- You're the hungriest fella I know!

307
00:27:23,474 --> 00:27:25,265
Never step down till you're asked.

308
00:27:25,266 --> 00:27:27,972
Howdy, driftin' a
few toward Blue Lake.

309
00:27:27,973 --> 00:27:30,636
- Didn't mean to butt in.
- Glad to have you stop by.

310
00:27:30,637 --> 00:27:32,771
Step down and visit.
Hey, Tess!

311
00:27:32,772 --> 00:27:35,516
- That's my kid.
- Yeah, real pretty.

312
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:37,855
Come here and say
howdy to the folks.

313
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,548
This is Dempsey Rae, honey.

314
00:27:41,202 --> 00:27:42,909
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

315
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:45,914
Say, never seen anyone
handle a two year old any better.

316
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:50,695
Thanks, usually I don't work broncs,
but we're a little short handed.

317
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,764
This here is the ropin' kid.

318
00:27:51,765 --> 00:27:54,839
- I'm Jeff Jimson.
- Pleased to meet you.

319
00:27:57,886 --> 00:27:59,943
I'd better get
some food on the table.

320
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:09,387
Make yourself at home,
Brick and me will be back directly.

321
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:10,346
Thank you.

322
00:28:14,654 --> 00:28:17,292
- Could be she likes you.
- Who likes me?

323
00:28:17,782 --> 00:28:19,615
- Tess.
- Aaahh.

324
00:28:19,868 --> 00:28:23,085
Yeah, she got real embarrassed
when you caught her in her pants.

325
00:28:23,088 --> 00:28:24,774
She is just a kid.

326
00:28:30,337 --> 00:28:33,954
Strap tells me you're running as
high as 15% on your winter loss.

327
00:28:33,956 --> 00:28:35,758
- That's heavy, isn't it?
- Too heavy.

328
00:28:36,219 --> 00:28:39,669
What with overgrazing on the range,
we gotta cut our losses or go broke.

329
00:28:39,806 --> 00:28:41,767
Now, Toliver thinks
he's got a way to do it.

330
00:28:41,768 --> 00:28:42,755
How's that.

331
00:28:42,758 --> 00:28:46,240
Winter feed. We've got good grass
down here in the river bottom

332
00:28:46,242 --> 00:28:48,820
that we can cut to stack,
and feed through the heavy snow.

333
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:51,614
I was trying we gonna
winter feed 10,000 heads.

334
00:28:51,777 --> 00:28:53,596
We ain't got 10,000 heads.

335
00:28:53,597 --> 00:28:55,657
And we cut enough grass for our few.

336
00:28:56,198 --> 00:28:58,902
How you gonna the cattles
off to you to get ready to cut?

337
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:02,711
Toliver has got that figured, in fact
he had the answer with him last night.

338
00:29:04,583 --> 00:29:05,997
Ever see any of this?

339
00:29:06,668 --> 00:29:09,073
Yes, I've seen it.

340
00:29:09,076 --> 00:29:11,280
Looks like it ought to
keep the cattle off the grass,

341
00:29:11,281 --> 00:29:13,364
once they tangle with
that stuff they learn better.

342
00:29:13,508 --> 00:29:15,964
Yeah, them barbs are sharp, feel 'em.

343
00:29:16,428 --> 00:29:19,050
- I have felt it
- What's wrong?

344
00:29:19,264 --> 00:29:22,235
I don't like it, and I don't
like anyone that uses it.

345
00:29:22,351 --> 00:29:24,943
Well, I aim to use it,
does that go for me?

346
00:29:26,022 --> 00:29:26,888
It does.

347
00:29:33,113 --> 00:29:35,571
I can't knock you down,
cause you're in my house.

348
00:29:35,908 --> 00:29:38,846
But I can tell you to leave.
Get out.

349
00:29:54,828 --> 00:29:55,858
Demps!

350
00:29:57,906 --> 00:29:59,630
- Why did you get upset?
- Leave it alone.

351
00:29:59,633 --> 00:30:01,552
- Yeah, but those people...
- Leave it alone.

352
00:30:14,223 --> 00:30:15,187
Jeff!

353
00:30:17,578 --> 00:30:20,448
- I'm sorry it went so badly.
- So am I.

354
00:30:20,664 --> 00:30:24,116
- Why did he act that way about the wire?
- I don't know.

355
00:30:25,085 --> 00:30:26,683
I just don't know.

356
00:30:26,962 --> 00:30:27,579
Goodbye.

357
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:30,639
Goodbye.

358
00:30:39,517 --> 00:30:41,460
Hey, Demps which way we heading?

359
00:30:41,978 --> 00:30:45,033
- Straight north.
- How do you know?

360
00:30:46,859 --> 00:30:49,116
Just take a star and follow it.

361
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:53,288
Of course, you gotta be
sure it's the right one.

362
00:30:53,574 --> 00:30:56,227
Oh, I guess I'll never
learn to pick the right one.

363
00:30:56,328 --> 00:30:57,828
Yes, you will.

364
00:30:58,454 --> 00:31:02,172
- Everybody’s got a star to follow.
- Which one's yours?

365
00:31:03,251 --> 00:31:03,950
Me?

366
00:31:05,878 --> 00:31:08,286
Never got around to
picking one from the south.

367
00:31:08,715 --> 00:31:12,795
Guess, I'm sort of like the cattle,
drifting north where the grass is.

368
00:31:12,796 --> 00:31:16,338
What makes you drift north?
Isn't there anymore grass in Texas?

369
00:31:16,339 --> 00:31:20,015
Lots of it, kid.
Tall, sweet and it's real good.

370
00:31:20,686 --> 00:31:23,604
Stretching out from
the Pecos to the Sabine.

371
00:31:24,774 --> 00:31:26,582
Then they brought in the wire.

372
00:31:28,111 --> 00:31:31,278
You know it was all open
ranges far as you can see.

373
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:33,764
As far as a man could ride a horse

374
00:31:33,765 --> 00:31:36,412
or drive cattle, there
was nothing to stop you.

375
00:31:37,121 --> 00:31:39,446
Nothing to drag it out.

376
00:31:39,874 --> 00:31:41,249
That's why you came up here?

377
00:31:43,336 --> 00:31:44,249
Yeah.

378
00:31:45,964 --> 00:31:48,585
Now the wire's
catching up with me again.

379
00:31:49,551 --> 00:31:53,798
You know, kid?  You and I
may just wind up in Canada.

380
00:32:09,155 --> 00:32:11,096
Well I've put the herd up
on the lake, like you said,

381
00:32:10,997 --> 00:32:12,970
but have you seen the
grass in that section, lately?

382
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:14,670
- No.
- Just about it all.

383
00:32:16,705 --> 00:32:19,260
- Anything wrong?
- Not exactly.

384
00:32:19,541 --> 00:32:21,699
- Something more we can do?
- Yeah.

385
00:32:22,169 --> 00:32:23,994
Stick around till the
rest of the boys come in.

386
00:32:23,995 --> 00:32:25,800
You're going to
meet the new owner.

387
00:32:25,964 --> 00:32:28,187
Oh, he's here, huh?

388
00:32:28,885 --> 00:32:33,381
- Say, did he use it yet?
- I wouldn't know.

389
00:32:38,937 --> 00:32:42,154
- Put him up for me, will you?
- Sure, Demps.  Come on.

390
00:32:54,244 --> 00:32:56,652
- You're going to a wedding or a funeral?
- Neither.

391
00:32:56,653 --> 00:32:59,322
- What you all prettied up for?
- Oh, personal reasons.

392
00:33:00,043 --> 00:33:03,030
Going to the ranch house.
Gotta cook for the boss.

393
00:33:03,713 --> 00:33:06,221
Hey, you got that thing I sent for?

394
00:33:06,883 --> 00:33:09,834
Oh, inside.
Right by the door, real pretty.

395
00:33:09,835 --> 00:33:11,135
Thanks.

396
00:33:24,236 --> 00:33:26,987
Don't you know a man can
get himself killed doing that?

397
00:33:28,073 --> 00:33:29,288
Got on him, kid.

398
00:33:30,325 --> 00:33:31,421
Better wear this.

399
00:33:35,414 --> 00:33:38,615
- It's for me?
- Well, it ain't for me. I got one.

400
00:33:38,917 --> 00:33:40,031
Put it on.

401
00:33:41,211 --> 00:33:43,881
No, you're a lefty ain't you?

402
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,554
Oh, thanks.

403
00:33:47,176 --> 00:33:49,649
- You shouldn't have done it.
- Why not?

404
00:33:49,763 --> 00:33:53,296
Like Idonee said, a man
can't walk around here naked.

405
00:33:53,298 --> 00:33:56,629
Say, looks pretty good.

406
00:33:58,689 --> 00:34:01,012
Come on.
Let's learn how to use it.

407
00:34:05,654 --> 00:34:07,030
Here, load.

408
00:34:13,412 --> 00:34:15,706
Alright kid, break it up.

409
00:34:24,383 --> 00:34:25,681
I meant the bottle.

410
00:34:26,218 --> 00:34:27,877
Well, I shot at the bottle.

411
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:33,499
Look, when you were a kid, I mean,
even younger than when you are now,

412
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,305
your mother ever tell you,
it was rude to point?

413
00:34:36,187 --> 00:34:37,129
Sure.

414
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:40,627
Well, when you're using a gun,
you're down right rude. So point.

415
00:34:41,543 --> 00:34:42,343
Point.

416
00:34:43,279 --> 00:34:43,978
Point!

417
00:34:48,225 --> 00:34:50,399
- You get the idea?
- Hey.

418
00:34:52,997 --> 00:34:55,124
Ready? Try it on this.

419
00:34:56,117 --> 00:34:58,244
Hey! Wait till I get clear!

420
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,004
No, no.

421
00:35:03,258 --> 00:35:06,245
This time from the draw.
I'll call it.

422
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:09,470
Go!

423
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:15,511
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't be, that's a good, fast draw.

424
00:35:15,771 --> 00:35:18,445
Let's try it again, and this time
slow down. Now, watch me, look.

425
00:35:18,941 --> 00:35:23,009
As the gun clears the leather, you
thumb back the hammer and point.

426
00:35:23,404 --> 00:35:24,584
- Get it?
- Uh huh.

427
00:35:24,584 --> 00:35:25,502
Do it.

428
00:35:25,615 --> 00:35:28,347
This time you gonna hit
that can plumb centre.

429
00:35:28,348 --> 00:35:30,365
Ten dollar says he doesn't.

430
00:35:39,005 --> 00:35:40,018
Say.

431
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:46,801
- I can use that.
- What did you say?

432
00:35:47,096 --> 00:35:49,254
I can use that ten dollars.

433
00:35:52,577 --> 00:35:54,451
Start shooting kid.

434
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:03,808
- You've just lost ten dollars.
- From where I see it, it's worth it.

435
00:36:04,782 --> 00:36:07,450
Do you shoot as cleverly as you talk?

436
00:36:07,452 --> 00:36:08,507
Better.

437
00:36:10,038 --> 00:36:11,965
Then why not win back your ten.

438
00:36:15,844 --> 00:36:17,470
Okay boys, whoa.

439
00:36:17,472 --> 00:36:19,472
Settle down you
boys, settle down.

440
00:36:21,508 --> 00:36:23,399
Keep away,
I can handle him.

441
00:36:24,845 --> 00:36:27,054
Whoa boys, settle down there.

442
00:36:27,055 --> 00:36:28,621
Not bad with horses.

443
00:36:28,808 --> 00:36:30,865
I'm not bad with anything.

444
00:36:33,938 --> 00:36:34,965
Say, who are you?

445
00:36:34,966 --> 00:36:37,789
I'm Reed Bowman
and you're impolite.

446
00:36:37,824 --> 00:36:39,233
You're the owner.

447
00:36:40,237 --> 00:36:43,238
Now I know why Strap
said he never seen you use it.

448
00:36:45,409 --> 00:36:46,455
Use what?

449
00:36:51,415 --> 00:36:53,345
If you're looking over
the ranch, I'll drive you.

450
00:36:53,346 --> 00:36:54,504
I've already looked it over.

451
00:36:54,505 --> 00:36:57,359
From what I've seen, I
don't like.  Including you.

452
00:37:03,787 --> 00:37:07,254
That's a lot of woman,
wouldn't you say?

453
00:37:08,892 --> 00:37:11,744
I was taught not
to say about women.

454
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:13,563
What's the matter with you?

455
00:37:14,064 --> 00:37:16,999
You didn't have to make such
a fool out of me in front of her.

456
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:22,853
Nobody can make a fool out of you,
kid.  You got to do that to yourself.

457
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:27,775
Why don't you give that gun to
cool off, and you do the same, huh?

458
00:37:31,792 --> 00:37:34,413
- Encie Joe Toole.
- How are you, Joe?

459
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,410
- Little Waco.
- A pleasure, ma'am.

460
00:37:37,411 --> 00:37:38,787
- From Waco?
- Yes, ma'am.

461
00:37:38,788 --> 00:37:40,246
- Baldy Lewis.
- Baldy.

462
00:37:40,801 --> 00:37:42,840
My top hand, Ladigo.

463
00:37:42,841 --> 00:37:45,217
- Pleased to meet you, Ladigo.
- Howdy, ma'am.

464
00:37:45,218 --> 00:37:47,465
- Dempsey Rae.
- We know each other.

465
00:37:47,466 --> 00:37:49,185
- Do we?
- The Texas kid.

466
00:37:49,561 --> 00:37:50,758
How do you do, Texas?

467
00:37:50,759 --> 00:37:52,729
- Chuck King.
- Chuck.

468
00:37:53,315 --> 00:37:56,066
- Hammer, my blacksmith.
- Glad to meet you ma'am.

469
00:37:56,067 --> 00:37:57,047
Nice to know you.

470
00:37:57,048 --> 00:37:58,271
The rest of the men
are out on the ranch.

471
00:37:58,393 --> 00:38:00,994
They're riding the line camp, I figured
you wouldn't want to call them in.

472
00:38:00,995 --> 00:38:02,190
No, not if they're busy.

473
00:38:05,369 --> 00:38:07,129
I have only one thing to say.

474
00:38:07,538 --> 00:38:09,547
I bought this ranch to make money.

475
00:38:09,916 --> 00:38:12,821
I pay good wages but expect good work.

476
00:38:14,254 --> 00:38:15,369
Any questions?

477
00:38:16,548 --> 00:38:18,878
You gonna be a
working boss, or absentee?

478
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,442
Say that again.

479
00:38:20,477 --> 00:38:23,759
All over Wyoming and Montana
we got absentee owners.

480
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,522
Folks that live in the East but
make their money on the West.

481
00:38:27,018 --> 00:38:29,673
I was wondering which
one you're gonna be.

482
00:38:29,979 --> 00:38:32,551
Well, stop wondering,
I'll be here.

483
00:38:33,149 --> 00:38:36,369
And there may be times
that when you wish I weren't.

484
00:38:37,154 --> 00:38:38,779
Well, I guess that's about all.

485
00:38:38,989 --> 00:38:42,475
Strap, you gonna have dinner with me
tonight. I have some things to talk over.

486
00:38:43,202 --> 00:38:44,365
And you too, Ladigo.

487
00:38:44,787 --> 00:38:47,076
Thank you, ma'am.
Anybody else?

488
00:38:48,874 --> 00:38:49,674
No.

489
00:38:52,169 --> 00:38:54,227
How does it feel to
be put in your place?

490
00:38:54,422 --> 00:38:57,457
I wouldn't know.
Why don't you try putting it there?

491
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:08,952
Now you're in your place,
I'm gonna keep you there.

492
00:39:13,192 --> 00:39:14,790
Oh, you're asking for it.

493
00:39:22,327 --> 00:39:24,666
Say, pardon ma'am,
didn't mean to block you.

494
00:39:39,804 --> 00:39:42,462
See what I mean kid?
Never turn your back.

495
00:39:50,565 --> 00:39:53,124
You're short of one man for dinner.

496
00:39:54,361 --> 00:39:57,100
Well, in that case,
be my guest.

497
00:40:05,123 --> 00:40:08,490
- Some wine?
- Why not? I can't get whiskey.

498
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:12,446
- Strap?
- Thank you, no.

499
00:40:13,506 --> 00:40:15,997
To the new boss of
Triangle and the cows.

500
00:40:15,998 --> 00:40:18,632
- All ten thousand of 'em.
- Fifteen thousand.

501
00:40:18,732 --> 00:40:21,840
The count was ten.  If you paid
for more, you got cheated.

502
00:40:22,057 --> 00:40:24,487
I didn't. There's a new
rig coming up from Texas,

503
00:40:24,488 --> 00:40:25,740
they should be here within one month.

504
00:40:25,775 --> 00:40:28,159
A lot of beef, how much
they charge you for?

505
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,795
The price was right.
I know cattle.

506
00:40:29,796 --> 00:40:33,018
Then you know you're bringing in
too many. The grass won't hold 'em.

507
00:40:33,019 --> 00:40:36,330
There's enough grass in Wyoming to
hold a million head, perhaps more.

508
00:40:36,331 --> 00:40:38,480
True, but it ain't all yours.

509
00:40:39,409 --> 00:40:42,575
- I'm afraid he's right.
- Why be afraid? It open range.

510
00:40:42,576 --> 00:40:45,202
Yeah, but who's gonna
tell Cassidy and other owners?

511
00:40:45,203 --> 00:40:47,746
- Aren't you?
- They are friends of mine, ma'am.

512
00:40:47,747 --> 00:40:49,399
I got no quarrel with them.

513
00:40:50,505 --> 00:40:52,852
Neither have I, as long
as they let me alone.

514
00:40:52,853 --> 00:40:54,715
Yeah, but you ain't
leaving them alone.

515
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:57,688
Ten thousand head on the ranch
now, and five more coming in.

516
00:40:57,929 --> 00:40:59,261
It just ain't right.

517
00:41:01,141 --> 00:41:03,434
Suppose you let me worry about that.

518
00:41:03,769 --> 00:41:05,960
Shall we go to the living room?

519
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:11,990
But where you gonna find
the men to work these cattle?

520
00:41:11,991 --> 00:41:13,325
You gonna worry about that too?

521
00:41:13,328 --> 00:41:14,986
- We'll find the men when we need them.
- Where?

522
00:41:14,987 --> 00:41:17,610
Then why not hire the men to
bring the cattle up from Texas?

523
00:41:17,612 --> 00:41:19,214
That seems like a good idea.

524
00:41:19,215 --> 00:41:20,415
Well, that depends on the men.

525
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:22,339
There are two kinds
that drive the trail.

526
00:41:22,456 --> 00:41:25,722
Them that knows cows
and them that knows trouble.

527
00:41:26,001 --> 00:41:28,391
He means men that
are handy with a gun.

528
00:41:28,392 --> 00:41:29,742
I know what he means.

529
00:41:30,072 --> 00:41:33,126
That might not be a bad idea
to have a few of those around.

530
00:41:33,342 --> 00:41:35,036
Not while I'm foreman.

531
00:41:36,303 --> 00:41:37,998
We'll see about that later.

532
00:41:41,685 --> 00:41:43,943
Thank you, Ma'am.
Good night.

533
00:41:48,025 --> 00:41:51,338
It doesn't look like Strap is
going to be quite strong enough

534
00:41:51,339 --> 00:41:52,933
for my type of operation.

535
00:41:53,013 --> 00:41:55,965
Just what is your type of operation?

536
00:41:56,158 --> 00:41:59,120
Before winter I intend to
have 30,000 head on the grass.

537
00:41:59,129 --> 00:42:01,976
This is open range and I'm going
to make the most of it while it last.

538
00:42:02,139 --> 00:42:06,586
At that rate it won't last long,
2 maybe 3 years and grass will be gone.

539
00:42:06,836 --> 00:42:08,165
So will I.

540
00:42:13,135 --> 00:42:15,303
Like you say, it's open
range and I suppose

541
00:42:15,304 --> 00:42:19,180
if a man's might, gets in,
gets what he wants and

542
00:42:19,183 --> 00:42:20,755
gets out in a hurry.

543
00:42:20,758 --> 00:42:23,780
Only this time it
happens to be a woman.

544
00:42:24,939 --> 00:42:25,769
I know.

545
00:42:27,525 --> 00:42:29,664
How much do you want to take over it?

546
00:42:31,779 --> 00:42:33,621
- As foreman?
- Yes

547
00:42:34,992 --> 00:42:37,515
- Not interested.
- Why not?

548
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:39,512
- Cause it means trouble.
- Trouble?

549
00:42:39,622 --> 00:42:42,820
Sure, Cassidy, Toliver and the others
ain't gonna take this lying down.

550
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:45,197
You keep crowding and
sooner or later, they will fight.

551
00:42:45,394 --> 00:42:49,229
- And if they do?
- Well, they ain't gonna fight with me.

552
00:42:49,507 --> 00:42:50,503
Why not?

553
00:42:51,759 --> 00:42:54,035
Because I'm not
interested in fighting.

554
00:42:54,971 --> 00:42:56,765
Not at thirty a month.

555
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:10,349
- Possible to make it fifty?
- Mm Mm.

556
00:43:10,863 --> 00:43:11,929
Sixty?

557
00:43:12,907 --> 00:43:13,523
Oop.

558
00:43:14,951 --> 00:43:18,435
- I'm gonna need you, Dempsey.
- Are you?

559
00:43:19,873 --> 00:43:21,187
What do you want?

560
00:43:26,463 --> 00:43:28,044
YOU

561
00:43:45,775 --> 00:43:48,098
- Thank you.
- Well...

562
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:50,034
It's nothing.

563
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:52,179
I wouldn't say that.

564
00:43:54,118 --> 00:43:57,837
- To my new foreman.
- Come on now, wait a minute.

565
00:43:58,373 --> 00:44:02,089
A lot of way to taking a man's job,
this is not one of them.

566
00:44:02,752 --> 00:44:04,411
What shall I call you then?

567
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:09,214
Well, let's say I'm... top hand.

568
00:44:15,056 --> 00:44:17,180
- What did you write?
- A nice figure.

569
00:44:18,185 --> 00:44:19,897
Not the one I want.

570
00:44:23,441 --> 00:44:26,048
I don't believe in overpaying help.

571
00:44:26,736 --> 00:44:29,178
I'll have a lot of trouble with you.

572
00:44:30,156 --> 00:44:31,737
You're so right.

573
00:44:44,389 --> 00:44:46,146
Let me have that branding iron.

574
00:44:53,347 --> 00:44:55,339
- Slap it up.
- Who, me?

575
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:58,139
Sure, it's time you learned
how to brand a maverick.

576
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:05,120
Say, that's real pretty.

577
00:45:06,072 --> 00:45:08,644
About another 10 years,
you'll be a top hand

578
00:45:09,409 --> 00:45:12,018
10 years after
an expert job like that?

579
00:45:14,291 --> 00:45:15,371
Come on, go on.

580
00:45:19,964 --> 00:45:21,690
Want to try it once for a dollar?

581
00:45:22,551 --> 00:45:24,559
- You call it.
- Okay.

582
00:45:27,265 --> 00:45:28,165
Now!

583
00:45:32,814 --> 00:45:34,595
You're gonna win
my whole months pay.

584
00:45:34,596 --> 00:45:36,970
Listen, for what you're
learning, you're buying it cheap.

585
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:39,697
This time, next month you'll be
helping me to sell my saddle.

586
00:45:45,081 --> 00:45:47,072
Is this what you're trying to do?

587
00:45:50,087 --> 00:45:50,952
Yeah!

588
00:45:51,296 --> 00:45:52,628
Well, how about this?

589
00:45:58,263 --> 00:46:00,176
Holy smoke!

590
00:46:00,177 --> 00:46:01,729
Or would you rather do this?

591
00:46:11,572 --> 00:46:14,508
- Oh Demps, when do I learn that?
- You don't.

592
00:46:14,701 --> 00:46:18,335
That's all a lot of hogwash, kid.
Look know this.

593
00:46:18,336 --> 00:46:20,621
Twirling a gun never
saved a man's life.

594
00:46:20,875 --> 00:46:22,968
There's only one
thing you gotta learn.

595
00:46:25,173 --> 00:46:26,701
Get it out fast.

596
00:46:26,883 --> 00:46:32,445
And then put it away slow.

597
00:46:33,601 --> 00:46:34,972
Get what I mean, kid?

598
00:46:34,973 --> 00:46:36,173
Hey!

599
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:40,255
All right.
Let's go to work, children.

600
00:46:40,257 --> 00:46:41,828
- The herd's in.
- Good.

601
00:46:42,211 --> 00:46:44,150
- Where about?
- Over on the flats.

602
00:46:44,151 --> 00:46:48,075
And Demps, all 5,000 of them are
strung out from here and Texas.

603
00:46:49,078 --> 00:46:50,160
Come my lady.

604
00:47:02,846 --> 00:47:04,209
There they be!

605
00:47:05,349 --> 00:47:06,840
Who brought them in?

606
00:47:06,843 --> 00:47:09,674
- Steve Miles, from the Sabine.
- Steve Miles?

607
00:47:11,607 --> 00:47:12,906
Yeah, you know him?

608
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:15,818
Yeah, I know him.

609
00:47:16,488 --> 00:47:17,979
Who's he got with him?

610
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:21,991
Well, there's
Tom Quitman, Concho Perez.

611
00:47:22,204 --> 00:47:26,005
He's got Yaqui Neal and Mublin, right
in point. But I don't know the others.

612
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:28,703
- You will.
- Yeah?

613
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:40,056
Hey, the boss lady gets around.

614
00:47:44,607 --> 00:47:47,660
Miss Bowman,
Steve Miles, trail boss.

615
00:47:47,662 --> 00:47:50,672
- How do you do?
- Says he'll need some cash for his men.

616
00:47:50,991 --> 00:47:54,558
Alright, Strap talked to you
about working at the Triangle?

617
00:47:55,621 --> 00:47:57,815
- Nope.
- Why not?

618
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:02,621
Well, I just don't think Steve
such a good hand with cattle.

619
00:48:03,298 --> 00:48:06,068
Well, they managed to bring
this out from Texas, didn't he?

620
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:08,304
Come on in to the ranch,
we'll talk it over.

621
00:48:08,362 --> 00:48:09,858
What about my men?

622
00:48:09,859 --> 00:48:12,655
You think they'd mind
waiting for you in town?

623
00:48:15,523 --> 00:48:17,300
That's it, boys.
Head for town!

624
00:48:19,318 --> 00:48:21,992
Is there any other orders or
shall I put the herd upon Blue Lake?

625
00:48:22,448 --> 00:48:26,318
What about Little River?  I thought
I told you to put some over there.

626
00:48:36,632 --> 00:48:38,410
Why, Dempsey Rae.

627
00:48:39,803 --> 00:48:40,868
Howdy, Steve.

628
00:48:41,179 --> 00:48:43,503
Did Texas get too small for you?

629
00:48:51,067 --> 00:48:54,185
Hey Dempsey, ride back to
the ranch with Miles and me.

630
00:48:58,034 --> 00:48:59,943
You and Texas take a few hundred.

631
00:49:00,579 --> 00:49:02,903
When you get your tally,
drift them north along the Little River.

632
00:49:02,905 --> 00:49:05,950
Hey, wait a minute. Cassidy has
been saving that grass along the river.

633
00:49:05,952 --> 00:49:08,694
They gonna use it this winter,
you gonna crowd them?

634
00:49:08,924 --> 00:49:12,393
I'm gonna do what I was told,
like to have you do the same thing.

635
00:49:12,762 --> 00:49:16,540
- Just don't have any trouble.
- Trouble, I don't want any trouble.

636
00:49:16,545 --> 00:49:18,675
Come on, Texas, let's cut them out.

637
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:27,451
Hey, Tex, there's a loose one,
I'll go on at it!

638
00:49:33,079 --> 00:49:35,654
Go get her, Waco,
show 'em who's boss!

639
00:49:50,184 --> 00:49:53,295
Texas, come here!
Quick, quick.

640
00:49:53,296 --> 00:49:54,974
Come on baby.
Let's go.

641
00:49:55,774 --> 00:49:58,015
Texas, come and help me!

642
00:49:58,403 --> 00:50:00,560
- Come over here!
- Take it easy, Waco!

643
00:50:01,157 --> 00:50:03,564
My foot ....
It's in the stirrup.

644
00:50:04,252 --> 00:50:05,830
Get me out of here.

645
00:50:15,141 --> 00:50:16,999
- What happened, Waco?
- I don't know.

646
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,585
I rode into it, I didn't see it.

647
00:50:19,888 --> 00:50:23,757
- I didn't even know it was there.
- Well, it won't be there much longer.

648
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:30,609
Come on!

649
00:50:50,427 --> 00:50:51,724
Leave it alone.

650
00:50:53,306 --> 00:50:54,752
Take off your gun belt.

651
00:51:00,525 --> 00:51:01,571
Drop it!

652
00:51:03,695 --> 00:51:05,109
Now step down.

653
00:51:16,377 --> 00:51:19,847
This my wire, son.
And I want you to leave it alone.

654
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:22,440
We're saving this
grass for our winter feed.

655
00:51:22,844 --> 00:51:26,815
We don't want our own cattle on it and
we don't want the Triangle cattle on it.

656
00:51:26,830 --> 00:51:28,383
Now is that understood?

657
00:51:30,604 --> 00:51:32,669
You heard what the man said.
Answer.

658
00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:36,536
Dad, dad. Little Waco has
been hurt. Come here, quick.

659
00:51:39,365 --> 00:51:41,938
He could've put that
between your eyes, son.

660
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:45,410
Take his gun.

661
00:51:46,834 --> 00:51:48,032
See what's wrong!

662
00:51:52,299 --> 00:51:53,827
Now, step up you.

663
00:52:13,284 --> 00:52:16,533
Your man got hung up on our wire.
His back would need some work.

664
00:52:16,535 --> 00:52:18,164
Here, let me have that boy.

665
00:52:18,274 --> 00:52:21,473
Step down, son.
I got just the thing to fix them cuts.

666
00:52:22,337 --> 00:52:23,700
Who are you?

667
00:52:24,131 --> 00:52:28,175
I'm Bill Cassidy, ma'am.  I want you to
know we're sorry about little Waco.

668
00:52:28,177 --> 00:52:30,005
And there's something
else we want you to know.

669
00:52:30,389 --> 00:52:33,660
It might be a good idea to keep
your cows away from Little River.

670
00:52:33,851 --> 00:52:36,324
- Why?
- Because we're stringing wire.

671
00:52:36,437 --> 00:52:38,810
From them canyon
down across the river bed.

672
00:52:38,812 --> 00:52:41,657
We figure to hold that grass
and keep it for winter feed.

673
00:52:44,490 --> 00:52:46,001
Do you own that ground?

674
00:52:46,117 --> 00:52:48,173
No, but we got there first.

675
00:52:48,175 --> 00:52:50,771
- Is that the law?
- We figure it is.

676
00:52:50,790 --> 00:52:54,835
- In other words, it's your law.
- We don't aim to be unfriendly, ma'am.

677
00:52:55,045 --> 00:52:58,895
But with you bringing in the big herd,
we've got to do something about our few.

678
00:52:58,995 --> 00:53:03,331
- That's why we are fencing that grass.
- Government grass, huh?

679
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:07,376
Call it that if you want,
but we're going to use it.

680
00:53:07,979 --> 00:53:10,006
So am I, Mr. Cassidy.

681
00:53:15,154 --> 00:53:17,346
We'll see about
that, Miss Bowman.

682
00:53:18,116 --> 00:53:18,950
Here!

683
00:53:19,451 --> 00:53:23,420
You got a wolf cub on your hands,
better teach him some manners.

684
00:53:26,042 --> 00:53:27,388
Let me have my gun!

685
00:53:28,504 --> 00:53:30,912
- Hold up your horse!
- Give me that gun!

686
00:53:34,012 --> 00:53:36,402
I said put up your horse.

687
00:53:42,106 --> 00:53:45,223
Jeff, what happened at Cassidy's?
Tell me!

688
00:53:49,489 --> 00:53:50,735
I don't like wire.

689
00:53:51,826 --> 00:53:53,902
I do not like anybody that uses it.

690
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:55,699
I've heard that before.

691
00:53:56,874 --> 00:53:57,920
Haven't you?

692
00:53:59,252 --> 00:54:03,118
You've got some men waiting
in town. Take 'em their money.

693
00:54:07,304 --> 00:54:09,627
I usually take my
orders from a foreman.

694
00:54:09,628 --> 00:54:11,805
You just took one
from your foreman.

695
00:54:11,810 --> 00:54:15,346
Strap is through as of today.
He sent a boy on a man's job.

696
00:54:20,946 --> 00:54:22,724
I want to talk to you later.

697
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:27,841
Looks like Dempsey got real soft.

698
00:54:29,249 --> 00:54:32,035
You and your men have three
days to get drunk and sober up,

699
00:54:32,037 --> 00:54:35,249
then report back to
the ranch ready for work.

700
00:54:46,370 --> 00:54:49,690
- So how's the back?
- Oh, I'm going to all right, Demps.

701
00:54:49,692 --> 00:54:51,910
Cookie smeared me with
some of that magic grease,

702
00:54:51,911 --> 00:54:55,427
and the cuts close up so fast,
they almost caught his finger.

703
00:55:14,168 --> 00:55:17,792
Hey Texas, why don't you let Cookie
smear you with some of his magic grease.

704
00:55:22,168 --> 00:55:24,928
Kid, let me have
a look at that arm.

705
00:55:29,219 --> 00:55:31,318
I thought I was only
supposed to drink sarsaparilla.

706
00:55:31,319 --> 00:55:33,847
It's not for drinking.
At least, not for you.

707
00:55:38,590 --> 00:55:40,196
She thinks I'm a boy.

708
00:55:40,377 --> 00:55:43,485
I'll catch up with that guy,
and when I do, I'll kill him!

709
00:55:43,488 --> 00:55:44,325
Shut up!

710
00:55:44,802 --> 00:55:46,523
Well, that's easy for you to say.

711
00:55:46,781 --> 00:55:48,898
It's not your arm,
you don't know how it feels!

712
00:55:51,770 --> 00:55:53,343
I know how it feels.

713
00:55:53,890 --> 00:55:56,455
And I'll tell you
something else I know.

714
00:55:56,884 --> 00:55:58,443
It's about a kid with
a gun, who was with me

715
00:55:58,444 --> 00:55:59,990
the first time I
met up with barb wire.

716
00:55:59,994 --> 00:56:02,957
He was just about your age
when he got himself killed!

717
00:56:18,088 --> 00:56:20,009
He looked a lot like you, too.

718
00:56:21,272 --> 00:56:24,151
Except his tooth was
broken, about right here.

719
00:56:26,112 --> 00:56:28,086
I was teaching him to twirl a gun,

720
00:56:28,087 --> 00:56:30,542
the barrel came around and
hit him right across the mouth.

721
00:56:32,224 --> 00:56:35,417
I laughed at him and
he took a punch at me.

722
00:56:37,796 --> 00:56:39,717
He can punch good too.

723
00:56:42,701 --> 00:56:43,812
Sit down.

724
00:56:49,894 --> 00:56:52,511
- He was your brother, huh?
- Yeah.

725
00:56:53,012 --> 00:56:55,773
You know, we had
a big spread in Texas.

726
00:56:56,172 --> 00:56:58,276
It's all open range.

727
00:56:59,373 --> 00:57:01,076
Then they brought in the wire.

728
00:57:01,535 --> 00:57:04,681
When the wire comes in,
there's fighting and killing.

729
00:57:06,608 --> 00:57:08,960
But this time we're going away.

730
00:57:11,722 --> 00:57:15,462
You get the word back to pack,
taking my clean shirt up.

731
00:57:15,838 --> 00:57:17,623
I'll collect our wages and

732
00:57:18,665 --> 00:57:22,001
we'll have a big night in town,
and drift north in the morning.

733
00:57:22,002 --> 00:57:23,324
Get it, kid.

734
00:57:25,691 --> 00:57:27,098
Oh, one thing more.

735
00:57:27,396 --> 00:57:30,097
Next time you hit me, use your fist.

736
00:57:30,349 --> 00:57:33,492
No man ever slaps me.

737
00:57:58,372 --> 00:58:00,763
- Anybody home?
- Who is it?

738
00:58:01,001 --> 00:58:03,663
- Me, Dempsey!
- Come in.

739
00:58:08,613 --> 00:58:10,781
- Where are you?
- In here.

740
00:58:18,991 --> 00:58:20,516
I'll be with you in just a minute.

741
00:58:23,654 --> 00:58:25,755
If you're embarrassed,
you can wait in the other room.

742
00:58:29,467 --> 00:58:30,851
If I'm not?

743
00:58:31,755 --> 00:58:33,190
It's still a good idea.

744
00:58:34,386 --> 00:58:37,673
Go on, make yourself
comfortable.  I won't be long.

745
01:00:01,979 --> 01:00:02,904
Help yourself.

746
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:06,271
Thanks.

747
01:00:08,051 --> 01:00:09,376
Later perhaps.

748
01:00:11,405 --> 01:00:16,114
- Quite a bathtub you got there.
- You're welcomed to use it anytime.

749
01:00:17,335 --> 01:00:19,396
Well, it better be quick,
I'm quitting.

750
01:00:21,071 --> 01:00:23,145
- Really?
- Yeah.

751
01:00:24,426 --> 01:00:27,148
Why?  Is it because
you're afraid of Cassidy?

752
01:00:29,128 --> 01:00:31,240
Yeah, I'm afraid.

753
01:00:31,395 --> 01:00:34,007
- Of what?
- Of Cassidy.

754
01:00:35,566 --> 01:00:37,836
Come on now,
you know that's a lie.

755
01:00:39,583 --> 01:00:41,676
But you are afraid of something.

756
01:00:44,017 --> 01:00:44,924
Yeah.

757
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:49,728
Now, I'm afraid of you.
Now, can I have my wages?

758
01:00:50,389 --> 01:00:53,907
If that's the way you feel about it,
how much do I have coming to you?

759
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:57,716
Why don't you look in the book?

760
01:00:58,714 --> 01:01:03,157
I don't have to look in the book,
I can still remember what you wrote.

761
01:01:07,257 --> 01:01:08,148
Well?

762
01:01:09,101 --> 01:01:11,131
So you came here to collect.

763
01:01:26,253 --> 01:01:29,298
Just how far would
you go to keep a foreman?

764
01:01:30,399 --> 01:01:33,390
Well, I might even marry him.

765
01:01:33,393 --> 01:01:36,383
Oh, slap the trying lion, on his rump.

766
01:01:55,901 --> 01:01:57,416
By the way,
when you see Strap,

767
01:01:57,645 --> 01:01:59,581
when you tell him
he's no longer foreman.

768
01:01:59,857 --> 01:02:02,307
- I'm not gonna do that.
- Why?

769
01:02:02,337 --> 01:02:04,894
- Cause I won't be seeing him.
- Of course you will.

770
01:02:04,895 --> 01:02:07,050
Well, you'll be putting their herd
down on Little River and when you ...

771
01:02:07,059 --> 01:02:07,992
Uh Mmm.

772
01:02:09,541 --> 01:02:11,092
Well, I thought we agreed that you ...

773
01:02:11,093 --> 01:02:14,138
You agreed that I was going to
put your cattle on Cassidy's grass.

774
01:02:14,461 --> 01:02:17,512
All I agreed to do was let
you make a fool of yourself.

775
01:02:19,177 --> 01:02:21,660
How low can a man get.

776
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:24,038
I wouldn't know about a man.

777
01:02:24,474 --> 01:02:27,326
But I've just seen how low a
woman will go to get what she wants.

778
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:30,693
Now, you don't look good.

779
01:02:34,025 --> 01:02:38,430
- And you're leaving?
- Yeah, taking the kid with me, too.

780
01:02:38,780 --> 01:02:42,160
You know, Steve Miles
is your kind of man.

781
01:02:42,351 --> 01:02:45,026
You pay him the right wages
and he'll do your killing.

782
01:02:46,464 --> 01:02:49,708
Speaking of wages,
you still haven't collected yours.

783
01:02:50,354 --> 01:02:51,572
Haven't I?

784
01:03:04,239 --> 01:03:05,067
Tex!

785
01:03:06,942 --> 01:03:07,853
Hey Tex!

786
01:03:10,394 --> 01:03:11,222
Tex?

787
01:03:11,434 --> 01:03:12,443
Hey, where is Texas?

788
01:03:12,444 --> 01:03:14,979
Well, he has been in and out
of here a couple of times.

789
01:03:15,926 --> 01:03:17,398
Wonder where he can be?

790
01:03:17,399 --> 01:03:20,080
Maybe he got tired of waiting
for you and rode into town.

791
01:03:20,090 --> 01:03:22,478
Yeah, maybe he did.

792
01:03:22,872 --> 01:03:25,186
Well, take care of
yourself, little Waco.

793
01:03:25,187 --> 01:03:26,394
Yeah, same to you, Demps.

794
01:03:26,656 --> 01:03:29,600
- Keep by the wire!
- Good riding!

795
01:03:39,134 --> 01:03:40,935
So long, Boss!

796
01:04:23,342 --> 01:04:24,726
Let's dance, Dempsey.

797
01:04:43,347 --> 01:04:46,965
- I'm the happiest man in town!
- What are you so happy about?

798
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:50,844
- On account that I'm leaving tonight.
- And whose gonna pay for the whiskey?

799
01:04:50,845 --> 01:04:54,191
Oh, set him up, Duckbill,
He's leaving without his saddle.

800
01:04:59,076 --> 01:05:00,607
Oh, oh. New girl in town.

801
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:03,621
- That must be the one.
- Who?

802
01:05:03,621 --> 01:05:05,801
That Triangle gal.

803
01:05:10,968 --> 01:05:13,242
What would you like to drink?
I'll get it for you.

804
01:05:13,430 --> 01:05:15,040
Anything you do.

805
01:05:20,062 --> 01:05:23,683
- Tex, why did you bring her here?
- Any reason, why I shouldn't?

806
01:05:24,195 --> 01:05:27,029
All right. Take her a drink
and let's get out of here.

807
01:05:27,030 --> 01:05:29,375
I've waited for you,
now you can wait for me.

808
01:05:29,993 --> 01:05:32,116
- Learns fast, huh.
- Two whiskeys.

809
01:05:32,117 --> 01:05:34,162
You know we don't
serve ladies in here.

810
01:05:34,417 --> 01:05:37,055
Duckbill, give me that again?

811
01:05:38,255 --> 01:05:39,535
You know what I mean.

812
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:42,757
- Not them kind of ladies.
- What kind of ladies?

813
01:05:42,758 --> 01:05:45,050
And don't you give me no
trouble, what was it you wanted?

814
01:05:45,151 --> 01:05:48,675
- One whisky and a sarsaparilla.
- I said two whiskeys!

815
01:05:49,061 --> 01:05:52,230
- Water on the side.
- Where am I supposed to get the water?

816
01:05:53,150 --> 01:05:54,099
Water.

817
01:05:55,069 --> 01:05:58,404
Duckbill, you get the water down
on Little River, they got plenty.

818
01:05:59,158 --> 01:06:00,569
Don't send Dempsey.

819
01:06:01,161 --> 01:06:02,620
He's scared of wire.

820
01:06:08,462 --> 01:06:10,205
What did you say, pig face?

821
01:06:13,009 --> 01:06:15,898
I said you're afraid of wire.

822
01:06:16,933 --> 01:06:19,142
You're leaving tonight, remember?

823
01:06:24,735 --> 01:06:26,874
She's right.
I don't want to fight you.

824
01:06:29,657 --> 01:06:32,328
I was under the prairie moon,

825
01:06:32,995 --> 01:06:34,823
whistling a lonesome tune

826
01:06:34,823 --> 01:06:39,626
when my roving eye came to sight her

827
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:44,382
And my heart grow lighter and lighter

828
01:06:45,012 --> 01:06:48,383
and the moon grow brighter and brighter.

829
01:06:48,851 --> 01:06:51,057
When I told her that she was swell,

830
01:06:51,057 --> 01:06:52,854
she said you're swell as well.

831
01:06:52,864 --> 01:06:55,901
I just don't know who was politer.

832
01:06:56,402 --> 01:06:59,523
Then my arms just seem to invite her

833
01:07:00,032 --> 01:07:03,153
and the moon grew brighter and brighter.

834
01:07:07,291 --> 01:07:10,378
So I rounded up some kisses to delight her

835
01:07:11,047 --> 01:07:14,049
and she roped me tighter and tighter

836
01:07:14,635 --> 01:07:18,005
and the moon grew brighter and brighter.

837
01:07:18,349 --> 01:07:21,884
Talked about her eyes are blue,
talked about the preacher too.

838
01:07:21,884 --> 01:07:25,064
Twas the preacher talk
that seem to dynamite me.

839
01:07:25,650 --> 01:07:28,771
She said she could tie
the knot and tie it tightly.

840
01:07:29,363 --> 01:07:32,448
And the moon grew brightly and brightly.

841
01:07:33,034 --> 01:07:36,203
And brightly and brightly.

842
01:07:40,921 --> 01:07:44,076
Another round again,
Duckbill, drinks for everybody!

843
01:07:46,637 --> 01:07:50,373
You know honey, looks like you're
gonna leave town without your boots, too.

844
01:07:59,029 --> 01:08:02,704
Come on, pretty girl, I'm going
to buy the next dance with you.

845
01:08:03,118 --> 01:08:05,110
- Please.
- Let her alone.

846
01:08:07,207 --> 01:08:08,404
What did you say, kid?

847
01:08:08,405 --> 01:08:11,655
I said get your dirty
hands off the lady.

848
01:08:14,616 --> 01:08:17,469
It's way past sonny's bedtime.

849
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:19,494
Get your hands off her!

850
01:08:30,029 --> 01:08:31,489
He asked for it, Demps.

851
01:08:33,116 --> 01:08:34,793
And you gave it to him.

852
01:08:37,665 --> 01:08:39,240
Why you little killer.

853
01:08:41,044 --> 01:08:42,788
Why, you...!
Ow!

854
01:08:44,799 --> 01:08:46,643
So you learned how to kill.

855
01:08:47,844 --> 01:08:49,390
And you like it, huh.

856
01:08:52,142 --> 01:08:54,050
He had good teacher.

857
01:08:56,398 --> 01:08:58,606
We're leaving, you and me.

858
01:08:59,444 --> 01:09:01,848
But you had to use a kid to square it.

859
01:09:02,699 --> 01:09:03,729
Come on.

860
01:09:33,907 --> 01:09:35,270
Dempsey, wait!

861
01:09:41,292 --> 01:09:42,951
Who's playing with this?

862
01:09:43,419 --> 01:09:44,334
It's mine.

863
01:09:46,006 --> 01:09:48,167
- What's your story?
- Self-defense.

864
01:09:48,594 --> 01:09:51,220
I'll go along with that.
He was one of my men.

865
01:09:52,850 --> 01:09:55,524
All right, but don't
leave town till I tell you.

866
01:09:56,671 --> 01:09:58,449
If you want him
he'll be out at the ranch.

867
01:09:58,816 --> 01:10:01,354
- And I'll go with bail.
- All right, Miss Bowman.

868
01:10:01,903 --> 01:10:03,232
Jeff, take me home.

869
01:10:04,406 --> 01:10:07,027
Yeah , trot along with her, kid.

870
01:10:07,029 --> 01:10:08,152
I'm not a kid.

871
01:10:08,153 --> 01:10:11,130
Oh that's right, Texas.
You've grown real tall.

872
01:10:11,666 --> 01:10:13,243
And tonight you killed two men.

873
01:10:13,245 --> 01:10:15,044
The first time was on your own.

874
01:10:15,922 --> 01:10:19,124
But you needed the help of
an alley cat to kill the second.

875
01:10:33,404 --> 01:10:35,331
Take him up there and bury him.

876
01:10:41,207 --> 01:10:43,595
- Who was it this time?
- Tom McCloud.

877
01:10:43,596 --> 01:10:47,287
- We found him up on Caspers Ridge.
- Leave any signs?

878
01:10:47,287 --> 01:10:49,705
The thugs never leave any signs.

879
01:10:50,786 --> 01:10:54,005
Well, we're right back
where we were last week.

880
01:10:54,007 --> 01:10:57,318
Except there's another man dead, and
they've torn down the rest of our wire.

881
01:10:57,319 --> 01:11:00,383
- They, who's they?
- Steve Miles and his crowd.

882
01:11:00,566 --> 01:11:02,659
Aren't you going to do anything?

883
01:11:02,777 --> 01:11:05,185
Yes, I'm going to ride
out and have a talk.

884
01:11:05,185 --> 01:11:08,365
Could be some of the decent boys
might know something about this.

885
01:11:08,366 --> 01:11:12,152
You still got Little Waco and Fancy
Joe and some of the others out there.

886
01:11:12,374 --> 01:11:16,176
- Not anymore, they ain't. They quit.
- Why not sign them on?

887
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:19,915
Well, they ain't gunfighters, John,
they're working collar hands.

888
01:11:19,934 --> 01:11:23,136
Why they ain't no ten of them could
stand up to one of that bunch from Texas.

889
01:11:23,347 --> 01:11:25,386
Besides I wouldn't ask them to.

890
01:11:25,387 --> 01:11:28,323
You sign them on.
Let them start stringing wire.

891
01:11:28,358 --> 01:11:30,245
I'll ride out and see
they don't get hurt.

892
01:11:31,149 --> 01:11:34,980
John, your wife don't speak
to me, not that I blame her,

893
01:11:34,983 --> 01:11:37,312
but I still wouldn't like to
see her be a widow woman.

894
01:11:37,314 --> 01:11:40,362
Against that Miles bunch,
you ain't got a chance.

895
01:11:41,580 --> 01:11:44,535
Well, if he can't stop 'em,
who can?

896
01:11:48,381 --> 01:11:52,065
You knew the answer to that before
you asked me, didn't you Cassidy.

897
01:11:53,554 --> 01:11:55,446
Yeah, maybe I did.

898
01:11:55,891 --> 01:11:58,465
By golly, I'm going to have
a talk with that wife of mine.

899
01:11:58,466 --> 01:12:01,766
Seems like she don't know a
good woman once she sees one.

900
01:12:38,574 --> 01:12:40,068
- Idonee?
- Mm hm.

901
01:12:41,786 --> 01:12:44,176
- Did you get a bottle?
- Yup, two of 'em.

902
01:12:44,832 --> 01:12:45,632
Wonderful.

903
01:12:46,959 --> 01:12:48,389
Give me a little drink.

904
01:12:49,338 --> 01:12:50,813
Sure I will, honey.

905
01:12:56,765 --> 01:13:01,030
- Not so much water in the second one.
- Call and I've got it.

906
01:13:04,734 --> 01:13:06,377
Aye, it's just as bad.

907
01:13:07,946 --> 01:13:09,362
Give me the bottle.

908
01:13:11,201 --> 01:13:13,093
Anything you say, honey.

909
01:13:15,791 --> 01:13:19,362
- Why did you do that for?
- Well, it's time to get up!

910
01:13:33,982 --> 01:13:36,305
Why didn't you tell
me the train is here?

911
01:13:36,308 --> 01:13:39,320
Honey, there's been eight
trains in, since you decided to leave.

912
01:13:39,321 --> 01:13:41,814
- And you missed all of them.
- I'm going to make this train.

913
01:13:41,815 --> 01:13:43,617
No you ain't making any train.

914
01:13:44,289 --> 01:13:48,833
Demp, why don't you admit it?
You're stuck on that gal.

915
01:13:49,462 --> 01:13:52,629
That's why you're letting her take
that kid and make a killer out of him.

916
01:13:53,675 --> 01:13:57,460
- Don't blame her for that.
- No? Maybe you're right.

917
01:13:57,722 --> 01:14:00,925
But who do I blame for that
Miles bunch killing two men

918
01:14:00,926 --> 01:14:03,853
and then tearing up all
the wire on Little River?

919
01:14:03,854 --> 01:14:05,213
What did you expect them to do?

920
01:14:05,214 --> 01:14:08,674
Can anyone expect them to do the
count is what I expect you to do!

921
01:14:09,363 --> 01:14:10,479
You know what I'm going to do?

922
01:14:10,824 --> 01:14:15,286
- I'm taking the next train out.
- Ha, you're taking the next train out.

923
01:14:15,539 --> 01:14:17,864
That's the story of your life, Demps.

924
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:22,730
No, I guess there's nothing a man
like you can do, except keep on running.

925
01:14:23,091 --> 01:14:25,297
But no matter where you go,

926
01:14:25,928 --> 01:14:28,051
you're gonna run
into that same fence,

927
01:14:28,597 --> 01:14:30,591
and it always has wire on it.

928
01:14:31,309 --> 01:14:34,180
You know them killings
is gonna go on and on

929
01:14:34,181 --> 01:14:36,646
until the wires come here to stay.

930
01:14:37,068 --> 01:14:39,441
And you know it better
than anybody in the world.

931
01:14:46,956 --> 01:14:47,839
Demps.

932
01:14:52,088 --> 01:14:53,386
Forgot something.

933
01:14:58,330 --> 01:15:00,024
It ain't rightly mine.

934
01:15:07,317 --> 01:15:08,581
I'll be seeing you.

935
01:15:31,926 --> 01:15:34,070
Come on Sachi, bring
the bottle with you.

936
01:15:34,771 --> 01:15:37,244
Yeah, maybe he'll
drink that all by himself.

937
01:15:42,414 --> 01:15:45,088
Cassidy, I'm moving the
Triangle cattle in on Little River.

938
01:15:45,193 --> 01:15:48,531
If I find any wire up that way,
I'm gonna make you eat it.

939
01:15:53,921 --> 01:15:56,877
What's the matter, Dempsey?
You look sick.

940
01:15:57,494 --> 01:16:00,216
What I'm looking at
that making me sick.

941
01:16:24,964 --> 01:16:26,576
Come on, let's see him dance.

942
01:17:13,028 --> 01:17:16,250
That's the prettiest
wrapped package I ever saw.

943
01:17:30,636 --> 01:17:32,479
You may be needing that, honey.

944
01:17:40,784 --> 01:17:42,015
Pull up on it.

945
01:17:54,585 --> 01:17:55,551
Get down!

946
01:18:14,612 --> 01:18:17,880
- Ben?
- I've done worse for the razor.

947
01:18:18,785 --> 01:18:21,091
Start down the hill
and move carefully.

948
01:18:22,081 --> 01:18:24,886
- Demps, you mean you gonna stay here?
- Go on.

949
01:18:46,405 --> 01:18:47,651
Hey, Concho, look!

950
01:18:50,828 --> 01:18:52,986
Old man Cassidy.

951
01:18:53,915 --> 01:18:56,388
I think we better dump him.

952
01:18:57,295 --> 01:18:58,308
I don't.

953
01:19:08,686 --> 01:19:11,360
- Don't shoot.
- I didn't intend to.

954
01:19:12,399 --> 01:19:13,893
Step down, Concho.

955
01:19:16,446 --> 01:19:18,439
I want you all in one piece.

956
01:19:19,241 --> 01:19:21,033
Dempsey, you all right?

957
01:19:21,661 --> 01:19:22,841
Couldn't be better!

958
01:19:31,633 --> 01:19:34,125
- Cut off the other end of that wire.
- What for?

959
01:19:34,721 --> 01:19:37,758
I got a package to deliver
and I don't want it to fall apart.

960
01:19:42,105 --> 01:19:43,766
Looks like it's your play, kid.

961
01:19:57,043 --> 01:19:58,372
Go get your boss, lady.

962
01:19:59,379 --> 01:20:00,411
Did you hear me?

963
01:20:17,069 --> 01:20:18,748
I got a package for you.

964
01:20:29,128 --> 01:20:29,909
Thank you.

965
01:20:29,910 --> 01:20:32,840
And the next time one of
your man touches our wire,

966
01:20:33,050 --> 01:20:35,724
I'll wrap a strand of it
around your pretty neck.

967
01:20:43,856 --> 01:20:46,146
Thinking of trying it
once for a dollar?

968
01:20:46,902 --> 01:20:49,244
- If I do?
- Don't do it, Texas.

969
01:20:51,199 --> 01:20:52,959
Afraid I might get hurt?

970
01:20:54,579 --> 01:20:55,824
Either way it breaks.

971
01:20:56,414 --> 01:20:57,957
That's real nice of you.

972
01:20:59,293 --> 01:21:03,078
And you can tell Steve Miles from
now on I'm wrapping the packages.

973
01:21:12,395 --> 01:21:13,526
Take it easy!

974
01:21:14,398 --> 01:21:16,557
You better go in the house.
I'll take care of him.

975
01:21:26,372 --> 01:21:28,198
- How did this happen?
- Dempsey.

976
01:21:28,199 --> 01:21:31,210
- He was waiting at the wire.
- Dempsey brought you in?

977
01:21:31,420 --> 01:21:32,167
Yeah.

978
01:21:33,673 --> 01:21:34,788
You were here?

979
01:21:35,718 --> 01:21:39,053
- Yes, I was here.
- And you didn't go for your gun.

980
01:21:42,645 --> 01:21:45,100
- Would you have?
- Yeah.

981
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:54,334
If you were a man, I'd kill you.

982
01:21:55,035 --> 01:21:58,287
Strange, I thought
you only shot at boys.

983
01:22:00,668 --> 01:22:05,064
But Dempsey says to return
his call any time you feel like it.

984
01:22:06,301 --> 01:22:07,630
That's not a bad idea.

985
01:22:08,221 --> 01:22:11,139
Only this time we'll bring a few
thousand head of cattle with us.

986
01:22:11,139 --> 01:22:14,013
Texas style.
He'll understand that.

987
01:22:44,519 --> 01:22:46,679
Never step down till you're asked.

988
01:22:59,373 --> 01:23:00,849
Take it easy, Jeff.

989
01:23:04,171 --> 01:23:07,376
- Who won the dollar?
- Steve Miles.

990
01:23:07,759 --> 01:23:10,714
He's coming here, now. Texas style.

991
01:23:11,306 --> 01:23:12,765
Texas style, huh.

992
01:23:17,271 --> 01:23:19,598
Everything is going
to be all right, Jeff.

993
01:23:20,008 --> 01:23:22,435
- Can you handle him?
- Of course I can.

994
01:23:30,874 --> 01:23:33,200
What does he mean, Texas style?

995
01:23:34,670 --> 01:23:37,921
You'll learn, or you'll be
up to your armpit in beef.

996
01:23:38,175 --> 01:23:38,875
Come on.

997
01:23:54,322 --> 01:23:55,651
They're waiting at the wire.

998
01:23:56,325 --> 01:23:59,113
Well, that sound disappointing, man.
Send him along!

999
01:24:23,887 --> 01:24:25,841
They're not going to stop
until they reach the river!

1000
01:24:25,842 --> 01:24:27,307
And they'll take the wire with them.

1001
01:24:27,322 --> 01:24:30,944
They're not going to hit the
wire, we're going to turn 'em.

1002
01:24:31,205 --> 01:24:34,492
You mean you gonna turn a stampede,
when it's coming right at you?

1003
01:24:34,751 --> 01:24:38,220
- Got any better ideas?
- No.

1004
01:24:38,221 --> 01:24:40,457
Come on, it's your grass!

1005
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:50,185
Head them north!
Keep heading them north!

1006
01:27:25,492 --> 01:27:30,189
... longer you save the grass.  Seems
like you're entitled to use them up.

1007
01:27:30,189 --> 01:27:31,608
Yeah, we've been talking it over,

1008
01:27:31,609 --> 01:27:34,236
Demps, we're figuring around
setting up with a few hundred head.

1009
01:27:34,237 --> 01:27:36,202
Now there is a lot of good
range beyond Little River.

1010
01:27:36,203 --> 01:27:38,545
In no time at all, you'll
have a big place of your own.

1011
01:27:38,550 --> 01:27:41,754
Look, thanks, but I just
don't like barbed wire.

1012
01:27:45,510 --> 01:27:47,086
Well, I'll be seeing ya.

1013
01:27:54,898 --> 01:27:57,900
- What are you doing?
- I'm doing what you're doing.

1014
01:27:58,177 --> 01:27:59,770
Ain't you learn better?

1015
01:27:59,772 --> 01:28:02,105
Don't do like I do, do like I say.

1016
01:28:03,743 --> 01:28:04,525
Better yet,

1017
01:28:05,670 --> 01:28:06,986
do like she say.

1018
01:28:11,378 --> 01:28:12,676
I'll be seeing ya.

1019
01:28:15,842 --> 01:28:18,547
<i>Who knows, who knows?</i>

1020
01:28:18,803 --> 01:28:22,054
<i>Who knows which way the right way goes</i>

1021
01:28:22,154 --> 01:28:25,010
<i>The night is dark the way is far</i>

1022
01:28:25,011 --> 01:28:27,854
<i>for a man without a star.</i>

1023
01:28:28,138 --> 01:28:30,727
<i>Who knows, who knows?</i>

1024
01:28:31,191 --> 01:28:34,245
<i>Who knows which way the whirlwind blows</i>

1025
01:28:34,345 --> 01:28:37,024
<i>Or where the trail of tomorrow goes</i>

1026
01:28:37,025 --> 01:28:48,276
<i>For a man without a star.</i>
