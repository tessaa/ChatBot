1
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,812
I can't sing.

2
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,606
That was fine, Henry.

3
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:06,982
I can't sing like you.

4
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,152
Of course not.
You're supposed to sing like you.

5
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,155
Dad says I can't carry a tune
in a wheelbarrow.

6
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:14,615
Dad was joking.

7
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:17,284
I love your voice.
We both love your voice.

8
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:25,667
How about "Jingle Bells"?
That you can sing.

9
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:51,193
Mommy!

10
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,154
Henry.

11
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:00,702
"--for the third time and said:

12
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:04,331
'What will you give me
if I spin the straw for you this time also?'

13
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:08,418
'I have nothing left that I could give,'
answered the girl.

14
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:13,257
'Then promise me, if you should
become queen, your first child.'

15
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:17,553
'Who knows whether that will ever happen?'
thought the miller's daughter."

16
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:31,316
- No! Mommy!
- Henry. Henry.

17
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,819
- There's nothing you can do. No. Shh.
- Let me go! Mommy!

18
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,238
There's nothing you can do.
Listen. Listen to me.

19
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,739
I don't have much time.

20
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:40,701
You were in the car. It was spinning.
And all of a sudden...

21
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,870
...you were home
and it was two weeks ago...

22
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:47,624
...and you were watching yourself.
Watching your mom and dad read to you.

23
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:52,713
You time-traveled, okay?
Just like I did to come to see you.

24
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:56,884
I'm you, Henry. Understand?
When you're grown up.

25
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:59,178
We're the same person.

26
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:02,181
I know that's hard to understand,
but you will someday.

27
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,349
Oh, my God.

28
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:05,767
I have to go now.

29
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:11,190
But you don't need to be afraid, Henry.
You're gonna be okay, I promise.

30
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,990
Help that little boy!

31
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,681
- That took you long enough.
- You have no idea.

32
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,182
Okay.

33
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,060
So Christmas Eve. Got any plans?

34
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,853
Yeah, yeah. Big plans.

35
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,191
- Anything else?
- No, thank you.

36
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:46,201
Merry Christmas. Thank you very much.

37
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,063
Good morning, Chicago.
ChiTown radio time is 8 a.m.

38
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:17,024
News and sports are coming up next.

39
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:20,235
Shaping up to be a warm first day of spring
here in the Windy City.

40
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:29,828
Excuse me. I'm looking for something
on papermaking at Kelmscott.

41
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:33,081
Our special-collections librarian
can help you with that.

42
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:36,418
Can I help you?

43
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:42,591
Henry?

44
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,761
Yes?

45
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,393
Henry.

46
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,187
It's you.

47
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,108
You told me this would happen.

48
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:04,446
I'm supposed to act normal,
but I'm not really acting very normal.

49
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:14,331
I'm sorry.
I really have no idea who you are.

50
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,084
I'm Clare.

51
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,586
Clare Abshire.

52
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:23,048
Now, I know--
I know you don't know me.

53
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:28,762
Look, I know how odd this must be for you.
It's odd for me.

54
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,722
But, um...

55
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:35,811
...would you like to have dinner with me,
and I'll explain?

56
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,816
Henry, we've been planning this dinner
for a long time.

57
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,568
We have?

58
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:48,281
Go to the Beau Thai. It's your favorite.

59
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,493
- It is.
- Mm-hm.

60
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,585
You look like you've been
having a hard time.

61
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:06,258
You know, everything's gonna be okay.

62
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:15,142
So, um, is it "yes," then, to dinner?

63
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:21,273
Okay.

64
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:24,943
- Okay.
- Yeah.

65
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,778
Yeah. Um....

66
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,781
- So Beau Thai, 7.
- Mm-hm.

67
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,783
See you there.

68
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,187
Oh, shit.

69
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,600
- Hey.
- Oh, man.

70
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,060
Going somewhere, asshole?

71
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:41,603
I wouldn't bother.

72
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,063
Yeah? Why's that?

73
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,775
- You'll see.
- Shut up.

74
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:59,120
- Dispatch, Unit 11.
- Go ahead, 11.

75
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,914
I got a--

76
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,127
Jesus Christ.

77
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:12,968
- would you like another glass?
- Sure. Thank you.

78
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:17,806
Sorry. I was, uh, detained.

79
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:21,351
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, no big deal.

80
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,396
Thank you.

81
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,482
You do understand
why it is I don't know you?

82
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,277
Uh, of course.

83
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:33,613
When you're older,
you'll travel back to when I'm a little girl.

84
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,365
For me, ahh--

85
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,994
I mean, I've known you since--
Since I was 6 years old.

86
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,414
Since, um, you appeared in the meadow
behind my parents' house...

87
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,332
...where I used to play.

88
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,167
Um....

89
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,421
You're not really supposed to drink.

90
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,590
Why's that?

91
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:55,510
Well, you told me that Dr. Kendrick said
that you should stop drinking...

92
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:58,013
...because it makes you travel.

93
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:01,933
- Who's Dr. Kendrick?
- He's your doctor.

94
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,856
He wins the Berger for his work in genetics.
He.... He helps you.

95
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,359
This is too much.

96
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,571
I'm sorry.

97
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:18,450
You told me to go easy on you,
and, um, I'm not.

98
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,121
Ahh....

99
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,960
I wrote down every time
that you came to visit me.

100
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:33,548
Which I gather I did, or will do,
fairly often.

101
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,843
The last time that I saw you, I was 18.

102
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:40,639
Seems that you go back
to the same places a lot.

103
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,724
Yeah, it's like gravity.

104
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,893
Big events pull you in.

105
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,229
I was a big event.

106
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,357
So it would seem.

107
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,327
Clare, right?

108
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:05,372
Yeah.

109
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:10,085
Could we pretend just for a minute
that this is the first time we've met?

110
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,340
Okay.

111
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,509
Sure.

112
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:21,054
It's just that....

113
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,598
It's just that you're my best friend.

114
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,686
I've been in love with you all my life.

115
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:34,067
- Is this really necessary?
- Yeah. Count to 1000.

116
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,610
Ahh....

117
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,112
Okay.

118
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,531
One.

119
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,450
Two.

120
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,578
Three.

121
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,289
Four hundred.

122
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:49,999
Six hundred.

123
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,544
Eight hundred.

124
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,504
A thousand.

125
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,641
Do you want a drink?

126
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,154
I don't want a drink.

127
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,848
God, you're so young.

128
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:09,454
Tell me again.

129
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,539
How did we meet?

130
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:17,086
You're older than you are now.

131
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,673
Maybe I'm not supposed to tell you.

132
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,343
Well, I think I need to know.

133
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,548
Who's there?

134
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:03,424
Greetings, Earthling.

135
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:06,427
Mark, you idiot.

136
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:13,768
Ow! Clare, I'm not gonna hurt you.
Just please don't throw anything at me.

137
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:17,939
Who are you, how do you know my name,
and why can't you come out?

138
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,276
Can you just hand me the blanket?

139
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:22,902
Maybe I should call my mom.

140
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,530
No, no, no. Don't call your mom, please.

141
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:29,033
Just hand me the blanket and I'll leave.

142
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:45,466
What do you need the blanket for?

143
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,760
I'm a time traveler.

144
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,890
I come from the future.

145
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,310
And when I do,
I don't get to bring my clothes.

146
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:58,104
There's no such thing as time travelers.

147
00:14:58,522 --> 00:14:59,981
Yes, there is.

148
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:03,818
In fact, you and I are friends
in the future.

149
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,322
- When you're a lady.
- Am I pretty?

150
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,407
Yes.

151
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,409
Very.

152
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:13,161
Prove you're from the future.

153
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:17,540
Well, your name is Clare Abshire.

154
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,460
Born May 24th, 1972.

155
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:23,671
- Your parents are Philip and Lucille--
- So you know things.

156
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,257
That doesn't prove
you're from the future.

157
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,134
Okay.

158
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:34,349
This weekend, your brother, Mark,
who's a real pain in the ass...

159
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,517
...falls out of a tree and breaks his arm.

160
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:41,189
Yeah, but I won't know till then
if you're telling the truth or not.

161
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:45,652
Well, if you hang around long enough,
you'll see me disappear.

162
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,862
But you just got here.

163
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,074
I'll be back again.

164
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:53,368
Lots of times.

165
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,453
In fact...

166
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:59,958
...I'll be back next Tuesday at 4.

167
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:04,879
And it'd be great if, when you come then,
you could bring me some clothes.

168
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,341
Something your dad won't miss.

169
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,678
Nice to meet you.

170
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,760
Don't worry about that.
It's been over for a while.

171
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,724
This is weird.

172
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:27,021
I never knew you at this age.
I mean, I've only known you as this...

173
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,191
...mature, worldly person.

174
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,194
I'm competing against myself.

175
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,366
No.

176
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:47,041
You were just kind of my perfect guy.

177
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,300
I just can't get used to this.

178
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,928
I mean, I just keep waiting for you
to disappear.

179
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,721
Oh, it'll happen, believe me.

180
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,475
How's it feel?

181
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:07,728
I mean, I know what it's like
to watch you go...

182
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:11,399
...but what's it like
to always be the one that's going?

183
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:17,572
Sometimes it feels like
you've stood up too quickly.

184
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:22,577
Your hands and feet are tingling,
and then they're not there at all.

185
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:26,706
Sometimes it feels like your attention
has wandered just for an instant...

186
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,251
...then you're standing naked someplace.

187
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:33,462
Maybe you've been there before,
maybe you haven't.

188
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:37,008
You don't know how long it's gonna last,
so you start walking...

189
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,593
...till you find some clothes.

190
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,098
Then you seem just like everybody else.

191
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:48,978
Except you're stranded and all alone,
just waiting to disappear.

192
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,272
But you get to see people from the past.

193
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,275
People who are gone, like your mom.

194
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:58,070
Yeah, but the thing is,
you can't change what happens to them.

195
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:01,240
I've tried. It just happens anyway.

196
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:35,691
- It's nice. Hey.
- And this is Charisse, my roommate.

197
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:37,318
- Hi.
- My best friend.

198
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,779
- And our excellent cook for tonight.
- Welcome.

199
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,447
Because I don't cook.

200
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:45,493
Well, you should know that going in.
She's a lovely girl, but she can't cook toast.

201
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,662
- Gomez?
- Yeah, short for Gomolinski.

202
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:49,830
It's really nice to meet you.

203
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:53,834
We didn't wanna meet you, but seems to be
the only way to catch a glimpse of Clare.

204
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,628
Please ignore Gomez.

205
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,505
- Do you want some wine?
- No, thanks.

206
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:58,798
Do you want some water?

207
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,883
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah?

208
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,224
You didn't tell me how cute he was.

209
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,518
He's not that cute.
Doesn't talk much either.

210
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:13,020
I couldn't get anything out of him
except he's a librarian.

211
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:16,023
Well, maybe if you would stop
interrogating him....

212
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:19,235
You never had a boyfriend.
You spend every minute with the guy.

213
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,529
- Wondering what the draw is.
- Leave her alone.

214
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:24,740
She's codependent. You thought
she was gonna dodge that bullet?

215
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:26,534
I don't know.

216
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:29,287
I just think he's not that cute.

217
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:32,790
All right,
so can we put the potatoes in yet?

218
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:36,043
Or do you wanna wait
until the vegetables are done?

219
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,134
- Where's the pan?
- How do I know?

220
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,553
- You can help.
- I don't even live here.

221
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,388
- You--
- First, I'm a man.

222
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:48,848
Second of all, I'm a guest here.

223
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:27,261
Are you reading my diary?

224
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:31,182
Told you that was private.

225
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:36,604
- I didn't read it.
- Well, it kind of looked like you did.

226
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:40,399
I was trying to find the dates.

227
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:43,152
The dates that I go to see you.

228
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:47,281
So I could tell the little girl in the meadow.
If I'm that important to her...

229
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:51,577
...I wanted to tell her when I was coming
to see her so she wouldn't have to wait.

230
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:57,958
Christ, I'm sorry.
I don't know what I was thinking.

231
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,169
I should go.

232
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:07,009
I'd like you to stay.

233
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:20,981
You were there all night.

234
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:24,735
- Come on, kick his ass.
- Guys, check this out.

235
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:31,951
- Come on, he's a fag. Kick his ass.
- Oh, no.

236
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,369
Come on.

237
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,834
Hey, hey, hey. Break it up, break it up.

238
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:41,293
- Henry.
- Gomez.

239
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:42,753
What are you doing?

240
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,338
Goddamn homophobe.

241
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:47,174
Dude, what in the hell are you wearing?

242
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,970
- What's the date?
- What do you mean, "what's the date?"

243
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,681
- What year?
- What do you mean, "what year?"

244
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:58,269
- Forget it. I gotta get some clothes.
- Yeah, the pink's not working for you. Hey.

245
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,771
- What are you doing now?
- Picking a lock.

246
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,982
- Huh?
- Close the door.

247
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:08,779
You wanna tell me what the hell's
going on here? What are you on?

248
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,489
Seriously.

249
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:15,244
Hey, you know, if you have a problem,
maybe I can help.

250
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:17,163
Yeah, right.

251
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:20,416
I don't give a shit about you,
but Clare I care about.

252
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:25,421
- Why don't you tell me what this is about?
- You wanna know? I'm gonna tell you.

253
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:28,215
Because you and I are gonna be friends
for a long time.

254
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:29,717
You might as well know now.

255
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:32,803
- Know what?
- I look older, right?

256
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,389
That's because I am.

257
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,933
I've come back to this night
from the future.

258
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:39,977
I'm a time traveler.

259
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:44,315
Oh, my God, you are out of your mind.

260
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,358
Started when I was 6 years old.

261
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:50,738
I have fits. I disappear.
I travel through time.

262
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:53,365
I've come to this night from 2003.
What year is this?

263
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:55,910
- 1995. I don't like this.
- I get dislocated in time.

264
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:58,954
I never know when it's gonna happen
or where I'm gonna end up.

265
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:02,583
I have to break and enter,
steal clothes from the first person I see.

266
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:03,918
You name it, I've done it.

267
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:05,920
Uh-huh.
There's something wrong with you.

268
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:07,630
Yeah, there is.

269
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:11,342
But I care about Clare more than you can
imagine, so don't worry about that.

270
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,427
Whoa, hey, I'm reassured.

271
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:16,764
Listen, in the future,
do Charisse and I get married?

272
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,641
Do I go bald? Does Charisse go bald?

273
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:20,935
I'm not gonna tell you things
about your life.

274
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:25,022
- Knowing stuff in advance makes you crazy.
- You're full of shit, you know that?

275
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:28,943
- You won't think that in a minute.
- Yeah? Why's that?

276
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,500
- Hey.
- Hey.

277
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,961
- Charisse is out.
- Henry here?

278
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:50,130
- No, he's at the library.
- Don't marry him, Clare.

279
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:53,759
- What?
- Just don't marry Henry, okay?

280
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:57,555
- You know, he hasn't asked me yet.
- Yeah, you know what I'm talking about.

281
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,225
I love him.

282
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:03,769
Here. Come here.

283
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:11,318
I saw him last night at the Vic.

284
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:15,322
Barrel of laughs. First, he beats up a guy,
then we burglarize the Army-Navy store.

285
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:19,910
And then he tells me
that he's a time traveler.

286
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:25,499
You know,
because he travels through time.

287
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,335
And did you believe him?

288
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:29,837
Um....

289
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:32,840
Not until he disappeared
right in front of me, you know?

290
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,925
Like, he just disappeared.

291
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,635
Yeah, it's a problem.

292
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:46,979
- Are you saying you know about this?
- I've known for a very long time.

293
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:50,566
Okay, I don't know
what the hell's going on, all right?

294
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:53,944
I don't need to know how the whole thing
works, because I don't care.

295
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:58,449
But, uh, just presuming for a second that
we're not all out of our fricking minds...

296
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:01,410
...whatever Henry has, it's, uh....

297
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,704
It's not good.

298
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:09,168
I've been waiting for him my entire life,
and now he's here.

299
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:13,172
I mean, it's already happened.
I couldn't even change it if I wanted to.

300
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,554
Well, you're worse off than I thought.

301
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,726
Maybe I am.

302
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:35,861
That guy stole my wallet. My wallet!

303
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:43,160
That guy stole my wallet. Hold the train.

304
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,101
Excuse me.

305
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,397
- Are you Annette DeTamble?
- Yes.

306
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:13,524
I love you.

307
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:17,653
I mean, your work. Your SINGING.

308
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,113
You have a great voice.

309
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:24,201
Thank you. I appreciate that.

310
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:28,539
People don't usually recognize me.
Not on the subway, anyway. Ha, ha.

311
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,124
My name's Henry.

312
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:32,751
How funny.

313
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:36,797
I have a son named Henry.
But he's just 3.

314
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:40,926
I met a girl.

315
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:45,264
And since I've been with her, I feel safe.

316
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:50,436
I haven't felt that way for a long time.
Not since I was a kid.

317
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,231
I wish she could hear you sing.

318
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:56,984
Maybe she will one day.

319
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:07,578
I'm really glad I met you.

320
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,290
I'm glad I met you too.

321
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:21,592
Make sure that girl knows
how you feel about her.

322
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:26,597
Your son loves you very much.

323
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:30,017
I know.

324
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:14,978
Hello?

325
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:19,274
Dad?

326
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,909
What are you doing here?

327
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,748
I was worried.

328
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,042
I called you several times.

329
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,838
I've been ill.

330
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:43,382
Yeah.

331
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:47,094
- I called the orchestra.
- Hmm.

332
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,763
They told me you've been on sick leave
since September.

333
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,431
August.

334
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,772
Makes it hard to play the violin.

335
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:03,318
That's not gonna help.

336
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,654
Sure it does.

337
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,448
- Want one?
- No.

338
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:10,617
I don't drink anymore.

339
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:13,120
Pity.

340
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:16,540
It was our one shared enthusiasm.

341
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:20,127
First thing we gotta do is get someone
in here to clean the place up.

342
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,671
Make you some meals.
I mean, do you even eat?

343
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:25,841
I mean, do you want me
to come around more often?

344
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,134
Take you to the doctor?

345
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:29,970
- Help pay some bills? What?
- No.

346
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:33,098
No? "No" to what, everything?
Or just some of that?

347
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:37,728
Get your own life in order
before you start telling me how to live mine.

348
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:41,982
I'm getting married.

349
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:45,819
Who would marry you?

350
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:53,827
- Does she know about--?
- She knows everything about me.

351
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,662
Everything.

352
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:58,624
Her name's Clare.

353
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:01,585
Clare Abshire. She's an artist.

354
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:04,671
I'd really like to give her
Mom's wedding and engagement rings.

355
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:07,966
That's why I'm here.
And I think Mom would really like that.

356
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:13,138
How would you know what your mother
would like? You barely knew her.

357
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,973
I knew her.

358
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,017
I still know her now.

359
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,936
I've just seen her on the subway.

360
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:23,690
I see her pushing me in the stroller.
You know, I see her with you too.

361
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:26,234
This thing I have isn't always a curse.

362
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:29,321
Then why don't you keep her
from getting into that goddamn car?

363
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:31,531
I would if I could. You know that.

364
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,957
I've watched her die hundreds of times.

365
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,626
I can never get there in time to change it.

366
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,736
I still miss her.

367
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,241
I miss her every day.

368
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,869
So do I.

369
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:16,928
Henry.

370
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:27,397
I never wanted to have anything in my life
that I couldn't stand losing.

371
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,777
But it's too late for that.

372
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:36,907
It's not because you're beautiful
and smart and perfect.

373
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,913
I don't feel alone anymore.

374
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:48,251
will you marry me?

375
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,594
No.

376
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:01,723
I didn't mean that.

377
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,268
I just wanted to try it.
I just wanted to say it...

378
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:08,355
...to assert my own sense
of free will. I....

379
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:10,857
But my free will wants you.

380
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:12,859
- So it's a yes?
- Yes.

381
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:16,863
Of course.

382
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:24,746
A thousand times yes.

383
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,728
- You ever handled a gun before?
- Not exactly. I--

384
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:50,647
- Hello?
- Mom, we're home.

385
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,440
You are in for a treat, my friend.

386
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:56,736
Oh, my God. That dress looks like
it's been through the wars.

387
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:59,906
- I told you to have it shipped.
- Mom, it'll be fine.

388
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:03,076
Henry, I don't mean to be a nag,
but any word on your father?

389
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:05,745
- We'll need to adjust the seating plan.
- I'm not sure he'll make it.

390
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:09,666
Shame. He could've joined in
on the killing spree.

391
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,960
It's how men bond, apparently.

392
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:13,170
- Philip.
- Pull.

393
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:15,088
Philip, they're here.

394
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:24,431
Are you ready for this? It's a real circus.

395
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:27,267
Yes, I am, sir.

396
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:34,399
Hope you know what you've signed on for.
With Clare, I mean.

397
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,943
I'm not sure I understand.

398
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:42,949
Her mother and I didn't succeed in
preparing her for the real world, I'm afraid.

399
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:44,784
I don't know about that.

400
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:47,120
She seems to manage pretty well
for herself.

401
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:50,457
Well, that's good to hear.

402
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:56,087
Do you ever do any hunting?

403
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:01,051
No. Never.

404
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:05,180
Well, maybe I could
take you out sometime.

405
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,682
I'd like that. Yeah.

406
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:10,268
Usually I'm the one who's getting chased.

407
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:15,065
You know what they say.

408
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:18,276
Life's a hunt.

409
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:24,449
- Good morning.
- Morning.

410
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:26,326
Have a seat.

411
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,788
What can we do for you today?

412
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:33,250
- Cut it off.
- All of it?

413
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:37,921
Yeah, I'm getting married tomorrow.
And my wife, she likes short hair.

414
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,173
Congratulations.

415
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:45,303
See what we can do for you.
Try to make you happy, the both of you.

416
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:53,228
- Take your bags?
- I've got it. Thank you.

417
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:54,896
Very well.

418
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:07,659
Dad. You came.

419
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:19,462
Well...

420
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:22,424
...I suppose I'll have to meet her parents.

421
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,093
Her dad's a Republican.

422
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:26,511
And a hunter.

423
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,806
Oh, dear.

424
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,809
Give us a second. I gotta take a Vallum.

425
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,061
Vallum? Is that a good idea?

426
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:37,647
Wouldn't be a wedding without a groom.

427
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:38,857
Freak.

428
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:41,401
You okay in there?

429
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,408
Oh, shit.

430
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:51,411
- Let me get this for you, ladies.
- Thank you.

431
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:56,333
- This hair, it's always been difficult.
- Mom. Stop already, okay?

432
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,667
It's fine.

433
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:01,504
But, my God, you are beautiful.

434
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:04,382
When Henry sees you
coming down the aisle...

435
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,384
...he's gonna pass out on the spot.

436
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:11,014
Could you go check on the boys?

437
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,767
Okay. Oh, God.

438
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,268
Okay. Oh, shit.

439
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:20,690
- Are you guys nearly ready?
- Yeah. Yeah, we're good. We're fine.

440
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:24,402
Great day for a wedding, huh?
Flowers look really pretty and everything.

441
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:28,073
Everyone else is downstairs waiting.
What do you want me to tell Clare?

442
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,118
We'll just probably be, like, another
half an hour or so to get pretty, and then....

443
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:36,790
And then, you know, put some pants on,
and then we'll be ready to go.

444
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:38,708
Five minutes.

445
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:41,628
I'll let Clare know.

446
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:43,880
What year are you from?

447
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:47,300
- You look like my grandpa.
- Don't worry. It all works out.

448
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,302
Oh, great.

449
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:53,306
I just hope no one notices the gray hair.
You're not gonna have time to shave.

450
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:56,976
I don't know where they are.

451
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:51,656
Good luck, darling.

452
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:54,409
He's got gray hair.

453
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,164
What the hell?

454
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:01,541
Don't swear. We're getting married.

455
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:06,379
We are gathered here today to celebrate
the marriage of Henry and Clare.

456
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:11,050
In the presence of family and friends
and before God, they exchange these vows:

457
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:17,140
to have and to hold from this day forward,
for richer or for poorer...

458
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:21,394
...for better or for worse,
in sickness and in health.

459
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:27,192
And now I'd like to invite
my Lovely daughter...

460
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:33,031
...and my gallant new son-in-law
to the dance floor.

461
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:09,442
Howdy, stranger.

462
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:14,280
Sorry I missed the ceremony.

463
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:16,616
You didn't.

464
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:20,787
Do you wish I was him?

465
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:25,291
But you are.

466
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:39,722
I wonder if I'm a bigamist.

467
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:43,142
I think you're allowed to marry the same
person as many times as you want.

468
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:24,475
Oh, no. Don't.

469
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:48,059
Finally.

470
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:51,062
- Clare.
- Who'd you expect?

471
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:58,027
I brought you a turkey leg.
Our cook roasts the best turkey around.

472
00:44:58,445 --> 00:45:01,572
Well, that's what everyone says, anyway.

473
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:08,037
My dad was saving it for lunch.

474
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:13,835
He's been ignoring me,
so I really didn't think he deserved it.

475
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:17,714
He's been ignoring my mom too.

476
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:22,301
Alicia says they're really gonna
get a divorce this time.

477
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:26,639
They're not.

478
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:31,477
You never told me
anything like that before.

479
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:34,814
Well, I don't want you to worry
if you don't have to.

480
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:39,610
Maybe they should get a divorce.

481
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:43,197
Yeah, maybe.

482
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:46,701
Are you married?

483
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:49,579
Yes, I am.

484
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:55,168
- Is your wife a time traveler?
- No. No, thank God.

485
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:57,670
Do you Love her?

486
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:02,175
Yes. Very much.

487
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:07,346
What's wrong?

488
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:12,351
Nothing. I was just hoping
you're married to me.

489
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,823
Did you ever think about time?

490
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:27,617
It goes, Alec.

491
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:29,994
That's the business of time.

492
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:32,955
Tick, tick, tick--

493
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:48,346
I was with you in the meadow.

494
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:51,098
You were?

495
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:54,560
You were jealous of my wife.

496
00:46:57,689 --> 00:46:59,398
I was.

497
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:04,237
I used to try and convince myself...

498
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:08,241
...that you were married to someone fat
with a mustache.

499
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:11,911
Well, that is my type.

500
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:26,092
Come on, let's do this.

501
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:31,973
- That's great, guys. Thanks.
- You're welcome.

502
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:35,768
Honey?

503
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:45,820
Get him, Charlie.

504
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:47,113
Drop it.

505
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:45,504
Get back here, you son of a bitch.

506
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:52,345
You're back.

507
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:54,347
Did I miss Christmas?

508
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:57,683
Yeah. And New Year's.

509
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:01,979
Henry, you've been gone two weeks.

510
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:05,149
I couldn't get back. I tried everything.

511
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:07,860
Even got drunk trying to trigger it.

512
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:10,112
Guess that didn't work.

513
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:15,952
Um, I have to go.

514
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:18,204
Now? I just got here.

515
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:22,416
I know, but I have a show in two weeks.
Jeremy gave me a space to work in.

516
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:26,295
I mean, this place is too small.
I can't work here anymore.

517
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:29,215
And, Henry, my life doesn't stop
because you're gone.

518
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:30,716
I never said it did.

519
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:35,721
- Could we talk about this?
- Talk?

520
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:38,975
I have been here for two weeks
wanting to talk to you.

521
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:40,476
What do you wanna talk about?

522
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:44,397
I mean, how bad it feels to sit here
and wait for you?

523
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:48,025
I'm going to work.

524
00:49:55,283 --> 00:49:57,201
This is gonna be great. Have no worries.

525
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:58,911
All right. Thank you, sir.

526
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:00,579
- Good night.
- Good night.

527
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:03,249
- Yeah, I can't believe that.
- Yeah.

528
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:41,537
- We'll never make it in time.
- In time for what?

529
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:45,583
Somewhere in America, moments from now,
there could be a new multimillionaire.

530
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:48,919
Good evening, everybody. I'm Dave Long.
It's Tuesday....

531
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:51,714
- You can't be in here.
- We have to watch something.

532
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:54,675
- The TVs are gonna set you off.
- We have to watch something.

533
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:58,971
- To win, all you have to do....
- What's that?

534
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:00,598
Good luck.

535
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:04,310
What'd you do?

536
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:06,228
Our first winning number is...

537
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:09,815
- Seventeen.
- ...seventeen.

538
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:15,946
Up next:

539
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:19,784
- Maybe a 23.
- Number 23.

540
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:22,369
Or even a 32.

541
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:25,998
Thirty-two is next.

542
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:32,338
- Couldn't possibly be a 40.
- Followed by 40.

543
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:35,633
- That shouldn't be a 12.
- And our last number is...

544
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:37,843
...a 12.

545
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:41,847
So here are your winning numbers:

546
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:49,522
- Seventeen, 23, 32, 40 and 12.
- You just won $5 million.

547
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:51,315
You can't do that.

548
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:53,818
It's-- It's cheating.

549
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:58,906
- Okay. Let's rip it up.
- No.

550
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:03,786
Look, there are a lot of downsides
to my condition, okay?

551
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,454
But this is not one of them.

552
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:10,793
Exquisite plasterwork
in every room of the house.

553
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:12,920
Isn't it gorgeous?

554
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:16,215
This is not it.

555
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:20,136
- But I like it.
- You'll like another one more.

556
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:26,559
Just look at the fireplace.
It's got the "wow" factor.

557
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:29,186
The details, the architecture,
the windows.

558
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:32,565
- Spectacular.
- No. Not the one.

559
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,984
Uh, thank you.

560
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:43,951
Just look at this landscaping.
Wouldn't you love to see it in the spring?

561
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:48,247
Now, it's a little smaller
than the other places, but big on charm.

562
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:52,710
Now, the main entrance of this house
is actually towards the rear...

563
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:55,588
...where there is a charming garden.

564
00:52:55,755 --> 00:53:01,302
But look at these features. The fireplace.
That staircase, it's so handsome.

565
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:04,096
The wide-plank flooring. Love that.

566
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:09,351
Clare.

567
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:13,814
- We're home. See the garage?
- Uh-huh.

568
00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:15,274
- That's your studio.
- Aah!

569
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:16,817
Come on. Come on.

570
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:18,569
Come on.

571
00:53:21,406 --> 00:53:22,489
So here's the garden.

572
00:53:22,657 --> 00:53:24,325
- And over there is my studio.
- Oh, my.

573
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:28,579
- Things are going okay.
- This is....

574
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:29,788
- Mint?
- Yes.

575
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:31,248
- And black for you.
- Mm-hm.

576
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:33,792
- How many more of these do you want?
- Three's good.

577
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,502
He's awake.

578
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:37,963
- He's kicking. Max is kicking.
- Oh!

579
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:25,552
Do you know when you're gonna die?

580
00:54:33,728 --> 00:54:35,145
No.

581
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:39,692
I've never seen you older.

582
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:44,280
I've never seen you older
than 40-something.

583
00:54:45,073 --> 00:54:46,532
Never.

584
00:54:48,743 --> 00:54:50,202
Maybe you stop--

585
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:52,621
Maybe you stop traveling.

586
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,878
Somebody-- Somebody finds a cure.

587
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:04,216
There's gotta be some kind of drug
you can take. There's gotta be someone....

588
00:55:04,592 --> 00:55:06,802
Something. Something that can help.

589
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:17,563
We're having a baby.

590
00:55:21,526 --> 00:55:22,818
What?

591
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:40,919
I....

592
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:43,797
I think it's time.

593
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:47,634
It's time you find Dr. Kendrick.

594
00:55:50,555 --> 00:55:52,431
How did you say you found me?

595
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:55,809
When I'm older...

596
00:55:55,977 --> 00:56:00,189
...I travel back in time to see my wife
when she's a little girl.

597
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:04,443
She says I mentioned a Dr. Kendrick.

598
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:09,698
one an ENT, one a podiatrist, so....

599
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:12,034
I'm a geneticist.

600
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,622
And I have a genetic anomaly.

601
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:18,415
It's called Chrono-Impairment.

602
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:25,297
That's a term you came up with, apparently.
That's what she says.

603
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:28,467
Of course, now I've mentioned it,
you will call it that...

604
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:31,428
...and it'll be hard to tell
which came first.

605
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:35,307
You see, that's the thing
about time travel.

606
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:44,108
Did my students put you up to this?
Because, man, you are good.

607
00:56:44,275 --> 00:56:46,985
Oh, God.

608
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:49,822
You got me.

609
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:58,122
I knew this would be a waste of my time.

610
00:56:59,999 --> 00:57:04,002
Wait a minute. Uh, wait. Here.
Henry, wait.

611
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:04,062
Hey.

612
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:14,990
I lost the baby.

613
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:41,099
Kendrick.

614
00:58:43,394 --> 00:58:45,103
Mr. DeTamble.

615
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:47,606
My wife had a miscarriage.

616
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:55,739
I am very sorry about that,
but I don't see what I can do to help.

617
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:58,742
What if the baby's a traveler like me?

618
00:58:59,452 --> 00:59:03,288
What if it has the same genetic anomaly?
What if it traveled out of the womb?

619
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:07,793
You need help.
Not the kind of Help I can give you.

620
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:10,379
How can I prove it to you?

621
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:14,466
You can't. It's impossible.

622
00:59:14,842 --> 00:59:16,468
Well, just do one test.

623
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:22,140
If you don't find anything, fine. I'll leave
you alone, you can go back to your life.

624
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,268
I'm calling Security.

625
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:27,312
The grant.

626
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,356
The Berger Grant.

627
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:36,446
- Have you applied for it yet?
- How did you find out about that?

628
00:59:38,491 --> 00:59:39,491
You win.

629
00:59:50,503 --> 00:59:54,506
We're going to start the first series.
It'll take about 10 minutes.

630
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,045
Oh, shit.

631
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:42,220
Your brain emits a blast
of electromagnetic energy...

632
01:00:42,388 --> 01:00:46,767
...akin to an epileptic’s
right at the moment you travel.

633
01:00:46,934 --> 01:00:49,603
And you can see it right here.

634
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:53,023
Now, there are drugs for epilepsy
we can use.

635
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:58,737
But all of these drugs
are way too strong for a fetus...

636
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:02,407
...if, indeed, it is a similar condition
which is causing the miscarriage.

637
01:01:03,284 --> 01:01:07,412
I'm 10 weeks in now,
and we've never been that far along...

638
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:09,665
...so maybe the baby isn't gonna travel.

639
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:11,708
We're going to find out.

640
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:14,503
We're going to take a look
at Henry's genetic code.

641
01:01:15,129 --> 01:01:18,256
We'd like to take a look
at the clock genes.

642
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:21,343
And then I would like to run the same test
on the fetus.

643
01:01:22,261 --> 01:01:26,181
Not to worry.
It's a noninvasive extraction of cells.

644
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:28,558
But perhaps we'll get
some sort of indication...

645
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:31,269
...as how to bring you to full term.

646
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:53,458
Honey.

647
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:55,919
- What?
- Wake up. You're bleeding.

648
01:01:57,296 --> 01:01:58,547
What?

649
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:11,727
We could adopt.

650
01:02:15,523 --> 01:02:20,569
What's wrong with me wanting
one normal thing in my life?

651
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:25,782
I wanna be a mother.
I wanna bear a child, your child.

652
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:28,201
Why can't I have that?

653
01:02:29,328 --> 01:02:33,165
I've never seen us with a baby. Never.
I've traveled to the future...

654
01:02:33,332 --> 01:02:35,834
- ...and I've never seen it.
- I don't wanna hear that.

655
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:39,254
- You heard what the doctor said. You'd be--
- Stop.

656
01:02:50,641 --> 01:02:52,184
Okay, Henry.

657
01:02:52,351 --> 01:02:56,062
Uh, just to be official about this,
I need to ask you one last time:

658
01:02:56,230 --> 01:03:00,525
- You're sure you wanna do this?
- Yeah, yeah. I've signed the papers.

659
01:03:00,693 --> 01:03:04,821
Yeah. Yeah, I know, but, uh, vasectomy's
rarely a one-party decision.

660
01:03:05,698 --> 01:03:07,991
Yeah, well, this time it is.

661
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:10,035
You all right?

662
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:11,745
- You need us to call someone?
- No.

663
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:13,246
A cab?

664
01:03:26,928 --> 01:03:28,553
Henry.

665
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:37,687
Hey. What's the matter?

666
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:40,690
I don't really feel like being here
right now.

667
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:47,739
Is it me?

668
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:49,574
No.

669
01:03:50,868 --> 01:03:52,619
I did something.

670
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:56,081
It was hard, and you won't like it.

671
01:03:57,750 --> 01:03:59,417
What'd you do?

672
01:03:59,585 --> 01:04:01,419
You won't like it.

673
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:04,297
Well, then why'd you do it?

674
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:08,718
- To stop us from fighting.
- We're fighting?

675
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:11,137
Why?

676
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:16,059
Well, just once, one time, could you--?

677
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:19,771
Could you tell me the answer
to something I'm asking you?

678
01:04:20,773 --> 01:04:22,607
You wouldn't get it anyway.

679
01:04:29,448 --> 01:04:31,908
That wasn't very nice.

680
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:38,123
You've never kissed me before.

681
01:05:58,537 --> 01:05:59,871
I was with you in the meadow.

682
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:08,213
- When?
- You looked about 18.

683
01:06:09,382 --> 01:06:11,299
It was our first kiss.

684
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:16,012
Hmm....

685
01:06:17,765 --> 01:06:19,516
You were having a bad day.

686
01:06:20,893 --> 01:06:22,769
I did something.

687
01:06:24,105 --> 01:06:25,981
I did something I felt I had to do.

688
01:06:26,941 --> 01:06:30,443
Oh, please don't tell me something
that's gonna make me hate you.

689
01:06:37,034 --> 01:06:39,244
I had a vasectomy.

690
01:06:41,247 --> 01:06:42,747
I'm not gonna have a child...

691
01:06:42,915 --> 01:06:46,042
...with the same genetic disorder as me
who's gonna die. I--

692
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:48,044
I'm not gonna do it.

693
01:06:49,588 --> 01:06:51,548
How dare you?

694
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:56,177
You tricked me.

695
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:58,138
You--

696
01:06:58,305 --> 01:07:00,015
You came to that meadow...

697
01:07:00,182 --> 01:07:04,394
...and you forced yourself into the heart
and the mind of a little girl.

698
01:07:05,604 --> 01:07:07,772
What, you think that I wanted this life...

699
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:10,734
...this husband that disappears
without any kind of warning?

700
01:07:10,901 --> 01:07:14,404
Do you think anyone would want that?
Who would want that?

701
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:20,952
- You have a choice.
- I never had a choice.

702
01:08:28,145 --> 01:08:29,521
Hello?

703
01:09:16,235 --> 01:09:19,404
Thanks for coming.
It's freezing out there.

704
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:22,991
Where's Henry?

705
01:09:23,534 --> 01:09:25,326
Uh, I left him sleeping.

706
01:09:28,038 --> 01:09:30,415
I needed some time away from him.

707
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:33,918
How's that working out for you?

708
01:09:39,258 --> 01:09:40,800
You okay?

709
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:43,178
We had a fight.

710
01:09:43,929 --> 01:09:46,181
It was bad.

711
01:09:49,935 --> 01:09:53,938
Yeah, well,
he can be a pain in the ass, that guy.

712
01:10:10,331 --> 01:10:12,957
It's really good to see you.

713
01:10:44,865 --> 01:10:56,501
- Hi.
- Hi.

714
01:11:24,363 --> 01:11:26,239
What's up with you?

715
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:29,909
What?

716
01:11:31,704 --> 01:11:33,329
You're weird.

717
01:11:33,872 --> 01:11:35,748
Been weird all week.

718
01:11:35,916 --> 01:11:37,709
I'm pregnant.

719
01:11:41,171 --> 01:11:43,673
Do you remember the night
in the parking lot?

720
01:11:43,841 --> 01:11:46,050
When I came to get you?

721
01:11:46,218 --> 01:11:48,011
You were younger.

722
01:11:48,178 --> 01:11:49,512
Before the surgery.

723
01:11:55,352 --> 01:11:58,855
I mean, it's not like I cheated on you.

724
01:12:04,194 --> 01:12:06,362
If we lose this baby,
if something happens to--

725
01:12:06,530 --> 01:12:08,364
From now on...

726
01:12:09,283 --> 01:12:10,908
...we're not gonna fight anymore.

727
01:12:11,076 --> 01:12:13,786
We're not even getting excited.

728
01:12:13,954 --> 01:12:17,498
I mean, if stress is what's causing
the traveling...

729
01:12:18,125 --> 01:12:22,670
...then we should give this baby
the most serene gestation on the planet.

730
01:12:25,382 --> 01:12:28,760
Eighteen weeks and perfectly healthy.

731
01:12:31,472 --> 01:12:32,847
And you asked about the sex.

732
01:12:33,766 --> 01:12:38,436
It's a girl.

733
01:12:42,149 --> 01:12:45,109
It's got a really strong heartbeat.

734
01:12:51,033 --> 01:12:52,700
What about "Mia"?

735
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:54,911
That's really pretty.

736
01:12:55,788 --> 01:12:57,747
Where'd you get the book?

737
01:12:58,665 --> 01:13:00,583
From Charisse.

738
01:13:01,919 --> 01:13:03,336
"Jane"?

739
01:13:03,962 --> 01:13:06,881
I used to name all my dolls Jane.

740
01:13:09,134 --> 01:13:11,302
I'm not sure
we should be talking names yet.

741
01:13:12,262 --> 01:13:14,472
I'm just getting some ideas.

742
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:29,237
- Look, there's a man in there.
- See that?

743
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:31,447
- Oh, yeah. Oh, look.
- Doesn't have any clothes on.

744
01:13:31,615 --> 01:13:34,283
- What is he doing in there?
- Shit.

745
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:38,496
- Check this out.
- Wow, I don't believe that.

746
01:13:38,664 --> 01:13:41,165
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

747
01:13:48,298 --> 01:13:51,384
- Come down this way.
- But I wanna see the lion.

748
01:13:54,346 --> 01:14:01,018
Daddy.

749
01:14:09,194 --> 01:14:10,862
Come on, let's go.

750
01:14:11,029 --> 01:14:12,488
Come on.

751
01:14:13,991 --> 01:14:17,994
- This is the first time we've ever met.
- How do you do?

752
01:14:18,162 --> 01:14:20,705
- How old are you?
- Ten. How about you?

753
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:22,039
Thirty-eight.

754
01:14:23,542 --> 01:14:26,294
So tell me about you. How's school?
What are you learning?

755
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:30,214
Well, not much at school.
But I read all the time. I read about Egypt.

756
01:14:30,382 --> 01:14:32,383
Mom and I are reading
The Lord of the Rings.

757
01:14:32,551 --> 01:14:34,969
And Grandpa's teaching me the violin.

758
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:36,554
And I heard Grandma sing.

759
01:14:38,891 --> 01:14:42,226
It was beautiful. At the opera. Aida.

760
01:14:42,686 --> 01:14:46,564
- What, you time-traveled?
- Mom says you and I are exactly alike.

761
01:14:46,732 --> 01:14:48,691
Except Dr. Kendrick says I'm a prodigy.

762
01:14:48,859 --> 01:14:50,735
Because sometimes
I can choose where I go.

763
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:54,822
You can control it?
When you go and when you come back?

764
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:56,032
I'm learning.

765
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:59,076
I saw you and Mom walking in the street
before I was born.

766
01:14:59,244 --> 01:15:01,078
You walked right by me.

767
01:15:01,246 --> 01:15:03,748
- You were arguing.
- I bet.

768
01:15:06,376 --> 01:15:10,254
It's so good to meet you, Alba.
It's so good to see you.

769
01:15:10,422 --> 01:15:12,840
Me too, Daddy. Me too.

770
01:15:13,008 --> 01:15:15,218
I've really missed you.

771
01:15:21,266 --> 01:15:22,600
How long has it been?

772
01:15:23,936 --> 01:15:26,646
How old were you when I died? It's okay.

773
01:15:27,439 --> 01:15:29,106
Five.

774
01:15:29,274 --> 01:15:31,901
- Five?
- I'm sorry, I shouldn't have told you.

775
01:15:32,069 --> 01:15:35,154
No, no, it's okay. It's okay. I just....

776
01:15:35,948 --> 01:15:39,867
I haven't traveled
past my own life before.

777
01:15:41,537 --> 01:15:44,956
- How's your mom?
- She's okay.

778
01:15:45,123 --> 01:15:46,374
Sad.

779
01:15:48,293 --> 01:15:49,794
Alba, what are you doing?

780
01:15:49,962 --> 01:15:52,380
- That's my teacher.
- Get over here right now.

781
01:15:52,714 --> 01:15:55,216
You better go.
I don't want you to get in trouble.

782
01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:56,968
Come here.

783
01:16:04,142 --> 01:16:05,685
Go.

784
01:16:10,816 --> 01:16:14,485
- I love you, Daddy.
- I love you too, honey.

785
01:16:41,513 --> 01:16:43,180
Alba.

786
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:46,517
Alba?

787
01:16:49,354 --> 01:16:51,272
We name her Alba.

788
01:16:54,151 --> 01:16:57,236
- You met her?
- Yeah.

789
01:16:57,696 --> 01:16:59,947
She's so beautiful.

790
01:17:00,115 --> 01:17:02,199
And so smart.

791
01:17:02,367 --> 01:17:04,660
You're gonna love her so much.

792
01:17:13,128 --> 01:17:15,630
So everything's gonna be okay?

793
01:17:16,131 --> 01:17:17,548
Yeah.

794
01:17:19,384 --> 01:17:21,552
Everything's gonna be okay.

795
01:17:22,387 --> 01:17:24,180
- Push. She's coming.
- Deep breathing.

796
01:17:24,348 --> 01:17:26,807
- Push. Come on.
- Keep going. Come on.

797
01:17:26,975 --> 01:17:29,143
- More.
- There you go.

798
01:17:29,519 --> 01:17:31,896
Good work. There you go.

799
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:35,191
Congratulations. She's beautiful.

800
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:37,526
Oh, my God. Oh.

801
01:17:42,407 --> 01:17:44,408
Shh, shh, shh.

802
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:09,225
Hi.

803
01:18:43,218 --> 01:18:44,802
Henry?

804
01:18:54,771 --> 01:18:57,314
Do you know who Alba's playing with?

805
01:18:58,692 --> 01:18:59,900
It's gonna happen.

806
01:19:00,068 --> 01:19:01,694
- That's Alba.
- When?

807
01:19:01,862 --> 01:19:04,321
Yes, but who's she with?

808
01:19:04,489 --> 01:19:06,157
Your daughter.

809
01:19:06,324 --> 01:19:09,577
They're both your daughter.
She's time traveling.

810
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:10,911
Oh.

811
01:19:11,079 --> 01:19:12,163
This year.

812
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:16,834
Is it too weird?

813
01:19:17,669 --> 01:19:21,338
No. I think it's kind of magical.

814
01:19:27,262 --> 01:19:30,389
Hey. Where's Alba?

815
01:19:31,683 --> 01:19:33,559
She's gone.

816
01:19:38,064 --> 01:19:40,191
Honey, you wanna talk about it?

817
01:19:41,693 --> 01:19:43,235
No.

818
01:19:56,416 --> 01:19:57,875
- Hey. Do you want a hand?
- Nope.

819
01:19:58,043 --> 01:19:59,710
Are you sure?

820
01:20:01,213 --> 01:20:02,546
Okay. Okay.

821
01:20:04,591 --> 01:20:05,841
That's right, sing:

822
01:20:12,891 --> 01:20:14,350
Come on.

823
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:26,070
What was that about?

824
01:20:26,238 --> 01:20:27,655
What was what?

825
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:29,907
Why is she so upset?

826
01:20:30,075 --> 01:20:33,077
She was just sad for a minute, I guess.

827
01:20:34,788 --> 01:20:36,080
Okay, what does she know?

828
01:20:37,165 --> 01:20:40,167
Tell me, or I'll imagine the worst.

829
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:44,588
Go ahead and imagine it.
I mean, you're gonna do it anyway.

830
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,351
You all right?

831
01:20:57,519 --> 01:20:59,019
Mm-hm.

832
01:20:59,479 --> 01:21:01,021
Thanks.

833
01:21:10,448 --> 01:21:13,200
Did you have a nice birthday?

834
01:21:16,746 --> 01:21:19,206
Honey, you know,
if something's bothering you...

835
01:21:19,374 --> 01:21:21,750
...you can always tell Mommy.

836
01:21:22,794 --> 01:21:24,253
No, I can't.

837
01:21:24,963 --> 01:21:26,463
Why not?

838
01:21:26,923 --> 01:21:29,884
Because Daddy told me not to.

839
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:34,138
And you love Daddy.

840
01:21:34,306 --> 01:21:37,141
But sometimes Daddy can be wrong.

841
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:41,478
You wanna tell me what it is?
It's okay if you do.

842
01:21:41,646 --> 01:21:44,648
- You promise?
- I promise.

843
01:21:46,067 --> 01:21:48,652
Daddy's going to die.

844
01:21:52,282 --> 01:21:54,325
Who told you that?

845
01:21:54,993 --> 01:21:57,119
Alba told me.

846
01:22:00,957 --> 01:22:02,458
She did?

847
01:22:02,626 --> 01:22:07,004
She told me that Daddy would die
when I was 5 years old.

848
01:22:22,729 --> 01:22:27,441
Alba told me that you die
when she's 5 years old.

849
01:22:33,490 --> 01:22:38,369
The day that you landed in the hallway,
you were shot.

850
01:22:39,955 --> 01:22:43,165
That's it, isn't it?

851
01:22:43,333 --> 01:22:44,625
You get shot.

852
01:22:48,546 --> 01:22:51,090
I honestly don't know. I--

853
01:23:06,064 --> 01:23:07,898
I'm scared.

854
01:23:27,544 --> 01:23:29,920
- It's dead.
- But why?

855
01:23:30,088 --> 01:23:31,672
That's just what happens.

856
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:36,427
We're born, we live,
and then when we get old, we just die.

857
01:23:46,604 --> 01:23:47,938
Help me.

858
01:23:56,614 --> 01:24:00,242
- How did he get hypothermia?
- We need to let them do their work.

859
01:24:00,410 --> 01:24:03,287
He said that some guys were chasing him,
and it was snowing...

860
01:24:03,455 --> 01:24:06,415
...and he got on this freight-car train,
and then somebody locked him in.

861
01:24:07,792 --> 01:24:09,918
And-- Oh, God.

862
01:24:10,086 --> 01:24:12,713
They're going to save his foot.

863
01:24:13,465 --> 01:24:17,843
Now, he's going to be in a wheelchair for
a few months, but he's going to be all right.

864
01:24:19,971 --> 01:24:22,347
But he has to be able to walk.

865
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:24,558
He has to be able to run.

866
01:24:24,726 --> 01:24:26,685
If he can't run....

867
01:24:35,904 --> 01:24:37,529
Daddy?

868
01:24:39,991 --> 01:24:41,742
Are you dying?

869
01:24:42,535 --> 01:24:44,036
No.

870
01:24:46,331 --> 01:24:49,458
Are you going to have to be
in this chair from now on?

871
01:24:54,172 --> 01:24:56,090
Only for a little while, honey.

872
01:25:06,392 --> 01:25:10,604
Things are happening fast now, honey.
I'm traveling a lot.

873
01:25:11,314 --> 01:25:14,733
It might be because of
what they're giving me for the pain.

874
01:25:16,569 --> 01:25:19,488
Try to stay, Daddy.

875
01:25:19,864 --> 01:25:21,490
Well, how do you do it?

876
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:24,701
When I feel like I'm going...

877
01:25:24,869 --> 01:25:26,537
...I sing.

878
01:25:26,704 --> 01:25:28,622
I sing to myself.

879
01:25:32,627 --> 01:25:34,169
Let's try that.

880
01:26:04,701 --> 01:26:06,076
Clare.

881
01:26:06,578 --> 01:26:08,912
- Clare.
- I'm calling the hospital.

882
01:26:46,910 --> 01:26:48,952
This'll come in handy one day.

883
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:52,581
No, you need to feel it, honey.
It'll tell you when to twist.

884
01:26:55,627 --> 01:26:57,794
Oh, that's my girl.

885
01:26:59,130 --> 01:27:01,048
- This smells great, Mommy.
- That's ready.

886
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:04,134
- Straight over. Don't forget the baster.
- I've got it.

887
01:27:04,302 --> 01:27:06,803
- Be generous.
- Yeah. It's hot.

888
01:27:06,971 --> 01:27:08,639
Lots.

889
01:27:08,932 --> 01:27:10,766
- Oh!
- Careful.

890
01:27:10,934 --> 01:27:13,143
There you go. Okay, it's ready.

891
01:27:16,648 --> 01:27:18,232
Done.

892
01:27:18,608 --> 01:27:21,360
Look, everyone. It's snowing.

893
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:26,073
Oh, honey, your coat.

894
01:27:31,037 --> 01:27:32,496
Okay.

895
01:27:34,374 --> 01:27:37,334
There. There you go.

896
01:27:39,504 --> 01:27:41,171
Thank you.

897
01:27:51,557 --> 01:27:52,849
Wow!

898
01:27:53,017 --> 01:27:54,685
It's beautiful.

899
01:27:54,852 --> 01:27:57,813
Can we open the presents tonight?

900
01:27:57,981 --> 01:27:59,481
What presents?

901
01:27:59,649 --> 01:28:02,192
Santa doesn't come till you're asleep.

902
01:28:03,194 --> 01:28:06,238
I already looked in the closet.

903
01:28:06,406 --> 01:28:09,783
Alba, that closet was locked.

904
01:28:16,791 --> 01:28:19,001
Christmas is in the morning.

905
01:28:19,377 --> 01:28:22,587
That's the rule.
No presents on Christmas Eve.

906
01:28:22,755 --> 01:28:25,340
Well, then what are we gonna do?

907
01:28:44,986 --> 01:28:46,778
I'm gonna get you!

908
01:28:46,946 --> 01:28:49,656
Slow down. You almost slipped there.

909
01:28:51,409 --> 01:28:52,743
Come on, this way.

910
01:28:52,910 --> 01:28:54,453
Okay.

911
01:29:10,887 --> 01:29:12,179
- You need anything?
- No.

912
01:29:12,347 --> 01:29:13,680
- Oh, I'm good, hon.
- Okay.

913
01:29:13,848 --> 01:29:15,223
- Hey, Gomez.
- Hey.

914
01:29:15,391 --> 01:29:16,641
Come outside for a minute.

915
01:29:18,019 --> 01:29:19,978
- It's cold out there.
- Don't be an old man.

916
01:29:20,146 --> 01:29:21,438
Come on, just take a second.

917
01:29:21,606 --> 01:29:25,525
Well, I've never considered
myself a performer, but I'd like to try.

918
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:34,618
What, uh...?

919
01:29:34,994 --> 01:29:36,536
What's up?

920
01:29:40,625 --> 01:29:43,126
Just wanted to say
thanks for everything, man.

921
01:29:43,669 --> 01:29:46,630
- You've been a great friend.
- What are you talking about?

922
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:51,301
Something might happen tonight.

923
01:29:52,011 --> 01:29:53,637
All right?

924
01:29:53,805 --> 01:29:56,014
And I just wanna let you know...

925
01:29:56,808 --> 01:30:00,310
...that I know I've been a pain in the ass,
but you've been great.

926
01:30:01,396 --> 01:30:03,480
It's all been great.

927
01:30:06,901 --> 01:30:10,195
Yeah. Don't mention it.

928
01:30:11,197 --> 01:30:13,156
You guys crazy?

929
01:30:13,991 --> 01:30:16,410
It's freezing. Baby, put this on.

930
01:30:16,577 --> 01:30:19,162
Gomez, just give us a minute, man.

931
01:30:31,509 --> 01:30:34,177
Guys, can you believe it?

932
01:30:38,599 --> 01:30:41,518
We're gonna give them a minute or two.

933
01:30:45,815 --> 01:30:47,691
Henry?

934
01:30:52,321 --> 01:30:58,535
No.

935
01:30:59,454 --> 01:31:00,912
Come here.

936
01:31:03,708 --> 01:31:05,000
Come on.

937
01:31:35,239 --> 01:31:38,366
Why did you let me invite
all these people?

938
01:31:39,744 --> 01:31:42,245
I didn't want you to be alone.

939
01:31:51,964 --> 01:31:54,382
Hey. Hey.

940
01:31:57,220 --> 01:31:59,596
I wouldn't change anything.

941
01:32:01,807 --> 01:32:03,892
I would not give up...

942
01:32:04,352 --> 01:32:07,896
...one second of our life together.

943
01:32:56,404 --> 01:32:58,446
- Got it?
- Yeah. Shh, shh.

944
01:32:59,282 --> 01:33:00,740
Dad. Dad.

945
01:33:13,004 --> 01:33:14,629
I knew I clipped it.

946
01:33:14,797 --> 01:33:17,299
- I don't see any tracks.
- Yeah.

947
01:33:18,593 --> 01:33:20,010
Let's try over here.

948
01:33:34,275 --> 01:33:35,817
Clare.

949
01:33:36,402 --> 01:33:39,029
- Clare.
- I'm calling the hospital.

950
01:33:39,196 --> 01:33:40,947
Okay.

951
01:33:42,867 --> 01:33:46,578
I love you. More than anything.

952
01:33:46,746 --> 01:33:50,540
I love you. I'll always love you. Always.

953
01:33:50,708 --> 01:33:52,375
Stay here.

954
01:33:59,884 --> 01:34:01,509
Alba, sweetie.

955
01:34:01,677 --> 01:34:03,470
Daddy.

956
01:34:05,181 --> 01:34:07,474
Oh, Henry.

957
01:34:09,852 --> 01:34:11,603
Henry.

958
01:34:13,272 --> 01:34:15,357
Sweetheart.

959
01:35:34,145 --> 01:35:36,438
Aah! Whoa.

960
01:35:44,155 --> 01:35:46,823
- Daddy?
- Alba.

961
01:35:47,950 --> 01:35:50,994
Daddy, I knew I'd see you again.
I knew it.

962
01:35:58,586 --> 01:36:00,795
- How old are you? When is this?
- I'm 9.

963
01:36:00,963 --> 01:36:04,007
You're 9?
And your mom still leaves clothes?

964
01:36:04,175 --> 01:36:06,509
She says you never know.

965
01:36:06,677 --> 01:36:10,638
You remember Max and Rosa, don't you?
Gomez's kids.

966
01:36:10,806 --> 01:36:12,015
They're so grown-up.

967
01:36:13,392 --> 01:36:18,021
Run back to the house, you guys.
Tell Mom he's here. Tell her to come.

968
01:36:18,189 --> 01:36:19,355
Let's go.

969
01:36:19,523 --> 01:36:20,648
Wait up.

970
01:36:22,067 --> 01:36:25,403
Tell me the story
of how you and Mama met.

971
01:36:25,571 --> 01:36:29,699
- Doesn't she tell you?
- She does, but not like you do.

972
01:36:29,950 --> 01:36:32,535
Well, it was right here in this meadow.

973
01:36:34,163 --> 01:36:36,456
And one fine day...

974
01:36:36,874 --> 01:36:39,292
...your mom,
who's just a tiny little thing...

975
01:36:40,044 --> 01:36:43,046
...goes out to the clearing,
and there's a man there.

976
01:36:43,214 --> 01:36:46,508
- With no clothes.
- Not a stitch on him.

977
01:36:46,675 --> 01:36:49,385
After she gives him a blanket
she happens to be carrying...

978
01:36:49,553 --> 01:36:53,556
...he explains to her
that he's a time traveler.

979
01:36:53,724 --> 01:36:57,894
Now, for some reason
I'll never understand...

980
01:36:58,729 --> 01:36:59,854
...she believes him.

981
01:37:00,022 --> 01:37:01,189
Because it's true.

982
01:37:03,484 --> 01:37:04,567
Henry?

983
01:37:08,113 --> 01:37:10,073
- I'm going.
- No, Daddy. Sing.

984
01:37:10,533 --> 01:37:12,492
I can't sing.

985
01:37:28,676 --> 01:37:29,759
Henry.

986
01:37:35,933 --> 01:37:38,226
- Where are you from?
- I'm 39.

987
01:37:38,602 --> 01:37:41,437
Alba's just a baby.
We're in the house. We're happy.

988
01:37:42,189 --> 01:37:45,400
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?
I would've been here waiting.

989
01:37:45,568 --> 01:37:47,235
I didn't want you to wait.

990
01:37:49,613 --> 01:37:51,781
I don't want you
to spend your life waiting.

991
01:37:51,949 --> 01:37:53,283
Hmm....

992
01:37:54,034 --> 01:37:55,660
I love you.

993
01:37:58,414 --> 01:37:59,622
I can't stay.

994
01:38:00,583 --> 01:38:02,292
I know.

995
01:39:00,225 --> 01:39:02,018
Sometimes I think he's in the trees...

996
01:39:02,186 --> 01:39:04,646
...deciding when to come out
and surprise me.

997
01:39:04,813 --> 01:39:07,398
I used to think that
when I was a little girl.

998
01:39:07,566 --> 01:39:10,401
That he was always here,
even when he wasn't.

999
01:39:10,569 --> 01:39:13,321
I guess he is, isn't he?
