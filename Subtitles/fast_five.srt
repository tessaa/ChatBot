2
00:00:22,223 --> 00:00:25,142
Dominic Toretto,

3
00:00:25,184 --> 00:00:29,103
you are hereby sentenced
to serve 25 years to life

4
00:00:29,104 --> 00:00:33,104
At the Lompoc maximum
security prison system.

5
00:00:33,192 --> 00:00:36,012
without the possibility of early parole.

6
00:01:50,185 --> 00:01:52,021
This is all the aftermath

7
00:01:52,187 --> 00:01:54,188
Of a daring daylight breakout.

8
00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:57,026
There were 26 high risk inmates.

9
00:01:57,192 --> 00:01:59,277
Every one on board has been
accounted for

10
00:01:59,278 --> 00:02:01,195
Except for one - Dominic toretto.

11
00:02:01,196 --> 00:02:04,478
Police believe the identity of men they
believe had orchestrated the shocking escape

12
00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:06,179
has resulted amazingly in no fatality this afternoon

13
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:10,005
He is former federal agent
brian O'Conner.

14
00:02:10,206 --> 00:02:13,208
Appears to be a manhunt
underway for three fugitives tonight

15
00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:15,210
Multiple federal and local agencies
have joined forces

16
00:02:15,211 --> 00:02:21,216
In the search for - Dominic toretto and his
accomplishes Brian O'Conner and mia toretto.

17
00:02:21,217 --> 00:02:23,218
Despite every eye in the country
looking for them

18
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:27,009
Where toretto and O'Conner are now
is any ones guess

19
00:04:05,194 --> 00:04:06,988
Let's get out of here

20
00:04:12,403 --> 00:04:14,705
Mia...

21
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:23,504
Buster....

22
00:04:25,715 --> 00:04:27,508
Dom here yet.

23
00:04:27,717 --> 00:04:30,677
No. - When was the last
time you heard from him?

24
00:04:30,678 --> 00:04:34,678
A couple of weeks ago, up
in ecuador or somewhere.

25
00:04:35,683 --> 00:04:38,478
How does it feel ? - Whats that?

26
00:04:38,686 --> 00:04:42,686
Beyond the other side of a wanted person.

27
00:04:43,691 --> 00:04:46,611
Nice long. Yes.

28
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:32,991
Why Rio vince?

29
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:38,091
You mean after you everything
screwed up in LA ?

30
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:44,377
Made me free-Fall in South America after....

31
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:49,799
We kept on going if not for rosa...

32
00:06:19,704 --> 00:06:22,207
So...listen.

33
00:06:22,707 --> 00:06:24,507
There is a job coming up

34
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:27,711
I was hoping Dom was gonna
be here by now, but...

35
00:06:27,712 --> 00:06:31,282
This one's clean enough,
we can do it without him.

36
00:06:31,374 --> 00:06:32,674
Its a big gig.

37
00:06:32,675 --> 00:06:36,304
Couple of high end cars, easy targets.

38
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:39,681
*** is putting together a team
to swipe them

39
00:06:39,682 --> 00:06:41,683
Just need a few more willing bodies.

40
00:06:41,684 --> 00:06:43,478
But, I don't know.

41
00:06:43,686 --> 00:06:48,690
Look, the way car seem is down here, we
can unload them quick and get top dollar.

42
00:06:48,691 --> 00:06:51,486
Its easy money.

43
00:06:51,694 --> 00:06:54,489
From where i am seeing,

44
00:06:54,697 --> 00:06:58,201
It looks like you both
could use a pay day.

45
00:07:35,446 --> 00:07:36,405
What are you reading?

46
00:07:36,406 --> 00:07:40,118
Tour guide.
Yeah? Hmm..

47
00:07:43,121 --> 00:07:45,707
Tokyo.

48
00:07:51,754 --> 00:07:53,672
You know what all of these
places have in common.

49
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:55,425
No?

50
00:07:55,592 --> 00:07:58,177
All.

51
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,526
Here we go.

52
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:31,669
Excuse me, buddy

53
00:09:07,539 --> 00:09:09,349
Yeah, we have found them.

54
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:12,502
Yeah, second through last racer.

55
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:22,637
What, what is it?

56
00:09:22,845 --> 00:10:06,012
DEA tags, this car is en-Seized.

57
00:10:06,013 --> 00:10:07,723
Look, who showed up.

58
00:10:07,931 --> 00:10:11,393
Oh! GOD, i am so happy you are ok.

59
00:10:13,687 --> 00:10:16,564
I thought i told you to lay low
- we were running out of fuel.

60
00:10:16,565 --> 00:10:18,275
Had to make a call.

61
00:10:18,483 --> 00:10:21,360
Hey quit talking, we only
got a two minute window.

62
00:10:21,361 --> 00:10:24,323
Lets go, vince.

63
00:11:00,811 --> 00:11:03,964
Ladies first.

64
00:11:21,755 --> 00:11:25,133
See you baby.

65
00:11:39,064 --> 00:11:43,064
Change of plans,
wait for my call

66
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,114
Lets go.

67
00:12:02,045 --> 00:12:06,045
Where is she going?

68
00:12:13,557 --> 00:12:17,311
We are being robbed, go and pullover the train.

69
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:52,971
Access card, get the access card.

70
00:14:25,858 --> 00:14:30,278
Dom, there is a bridge.

71
00:14:42,524 --> 00:14:44,434
First is clear

72
00:14:44,543 --> 00:14:48,921
We are going to next ***

73
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:53,258
Freeze.

74
00:16:19,153 --> 00:16:21,123
We had to make a call, huh.

75
00:16:21,131 --> 00:16:23,640
Shitty call, O'Conner.

76
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:27,727
Shitty call

77
00:16:45,953 --> 00:16:49,582
You two started quite a
bit of trouble today.

78
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,500
Three of my men dead.

79
00:16:51,709 --> 00:16:54,378
Three dea agents, along with.

80
00:16:53,987 --> 00:16:55,904
Of course, this is business.

81
00:16:55,905 --> 00:16:59,117
Sometimes things go stray.

82
00:16:59,743 --> 00:17:01,660
All i care about is the car.

83
00:17:01,661 --> 00:17:03,371
Tell me where it is.

84
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:06,249
And i will let you go

85
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,210
*** full of shit

86
00:17:10,253 --> 00:17:14,089
I do not know how you guys do business
in your part of the world.

87
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:18,886
But here in Rio... i like all parties
to know what they are up against.

88
00:17:18,887 --> 00:17:21,890
That's funny, because it goes both ways.

89
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:27,145
You know...

90
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,150
I hear your sister is
very beautiful.

91
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:36,317
Wherever she hides, i will find her

92
00:18:40,343 --> 00:18:42,512
Mia?

93
00:18:43,221 --> 00:18:45,515
Hey ..

94
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:49,936
You ok? - Yeah, you all right?

95
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:02,407
And,here you are? Just like a toretto.

96
00:19:05,285 --> 00:19:06,995
Where's vince?

97
00:19:07,162 --> 00:19:08,913
That's a good question.

98
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,832
He'll be here.

99
00:19:10,999 --> 00:19:14,835
Guys, we are all over the news,they are blaming
us for killing of those DEA agents on the train.

100
00:19:14,836 --> 00:19:17,713
Which means we just jump to the top of
the wanted list.

101
00:19:17,714 --> 00:19:21,550
The feds will get us anywhere,
their agents are off the limits.

102
00:19:21,551 --> 00:19:24,053
They are gonna send their best guys,
we gotta get out of here

103
00:19:24,054 --> 00:19:26,389
One thing we know for sure

104
00:19:28,308 --> 00:19:30,977
Is that, they wanted this car.

105
00:19:31,186 --> 00:19:36,486
Something's in it. We find out what it is.
We know what we are up against.

106
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:58,963
Alright, listen up. The men we're after are professional runners.
They like speed and guarantee to go down the hardest possible way.

107
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:02,800
So make sure you got a lot of firearm.We find them,
we take them as a team and we bring them back.

108
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:06,941
And above all else, we never ever let
them get into cars.

109
00:20:07,597 --> 00:20:11,597
*** lets go hunt.

110
00:20:12,394 --> 00:20:15,105
Agent Hobbs? Chief of police.

111
00:20:15,272 --> 00:20:18,441
Sorry to hear for loss of your men.

112
00:20:22,028 --> 00:20:23,279
Is all this really necessary to apprehend two men?

113
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,823
Let me tell you little something about these two men.One's
a former federal officer, been in deep cover for 5 years.

114
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:34,456
Knows everyWay we are gonna come from.The other
one's a professional criminal, escaped prison twice,

115
00:20:34,457 --> 00:20:35,457
Spent half his life on run avoiding folks like you.

116
00:20:34,457 --> 00:20:36,208
Well, if there's anything we can do to help...

117
00:20:36,209 --> 00:20:36,834
Two things.

118
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:38,294
One - I need a translator.

119
00:20:38,295 --> 00:20:40,212
Alright, We have plenty...

120
00:20:40,213 --> 00:20:43,842
Elena Neves.
- A patrol officer?

121
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,009
You heard me.

122
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,927
But why? We have many more
experienced people.

123
00:20:46,928 --> 00:20:48,638
I like her smile.

124
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:51,516
What's the second thing.

125
00:20:51,725 --> 00:20:55,103
Stay the fu*k out of my way!

126
00:21:04,195 --> 00:21:06,489
Brian.

127
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:10,535
There is something i have to tell you.

128
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:11,710
Oh, damn.

129
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,539
What a mess.

130
00:21:14,748 --> 00:21:18,001
Where you have been Vin.

131
00:21:18,585 --> 00:21:20,502
You better check that tone.

132
00:21:20,503 --> 00:21:24,893
You better answer some goddam questions.
Stop it, both of you.

133
00:21:27,218 --> 00:21:28,928
Where were you vince.

134
00:21:29,137 --> 00:21:32,014
Guys all over are asking
questions about you

135
00:21:32,015 --> 00:21:33,933
Couldn't get out of there without
leading them straight to you

136
00:21:33,934 --> 00:21:34,892
Had to wait them out.

137
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:38,521
That is such a horse shit,
that was your job.

138
00:21:39,689 --> 00:21:42,566
Enough O'Conner! If he said he
didn't do it, he didn't do it.

139
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:45,445
Go walk it off.

140
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:02,711
Look, i would love to expand my
operations in your country

141
00:22:02,712 --> 00:22:04,422
But quite frankly.

142
00:22:04,631 --> 00:22:07,300
No business methods are hard to find.

143
00:22:07,509 --> 00:22:08,467
Let me tell you true story

144
00:22:08,468 --> 00:22:11,137
500 years ago

145
00:22:11,346 --> 00:22:14,015
Portuguese and spanish came here.

146
00:22:14,224 --> 00:22:18,224
Each trying to get the
country from there methods.

147
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:23,530
The spanish arrive guns blazing,
determine to prove who is boss.

148
00:22:25,694 --> 00:22:29,694
But, the natives killed every
single spaniard.

149
00:22:31,449 --> 00:22:35,078
Personally, i prefer the
methods of the portuguese.

150
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:36,997
They came bearing gifts.

151
00:22:37,205 --> 00:22:42,065
Mirrors, scissors, things that the
native couldn't get own their own.

152
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:47,755
But, to continue receiving them would
require will of portuguese

153
00:22:47,756 --> 00:22:51,756
And that's why all brazilians
speaks portuguese today.

154
00:22:52,553 --> 00:22:58,063
Now, if you Dominate the people with
violence, they will eventually fight back.

155
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:01,020
Because, they have nothing to lose.

156
00:23:01,228 --> 00:23:03,897
And, that's the key

157
00:23:04,106 --> 00:23:06,941
I go into the favals, and give
them something to lose

158
00:23:06,942 --> 00:23:10,942
Electricity, running water,
school room for their kids

159
00:23:13,657 --> 00:23:16,337
And for that taste of the better life

160
00:23:16,535 --> 00:23:19,204
I own them.

161
00:23:20,372 --> 00:23:22,791
Gentlemen.

162
00:23:32,843 --> 00:23:36,013
Pardon me gentlemen.

163
00:23:49,151 --> 00:23:53,151
I almost wish i didn't see it.

164
00:23:54,907 --> 00:23:56,617
Almost.

165
00:23:56,825 --> 00:23:59,495
Wait, Dom

166
00:23:59,703 --> 00:24:02,373
Mia was on that train

167
00:24:02,581 --> 00:24:05,458
I didn't.....i didn't know
i wouldn't do anything to hurt her.

168
00:24:05,459 --> 00:24:08,879
You set off the deal

169
00:24:09,296 --> 00:24:11,214
I thought the job was for the cars

170
00:24:11,215 --> 00:24:15,215
I did not know. All they
wanted was the chip.

171
00:24:16,011 --> 00:24:17,721
Damn.

172
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:20,599
You should have come clean.

173
00:24:20,808 --> 00:24:22,668
What's going on out here?

174
00:24:22,726 --> 00:24:24,436
Nothing. Please, Dom.

175
00:24:24,645 --> 00:24:29,945
Just, let me have the chip.
I can take this to them and set things right.

176
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:32,987
Get out!

177
00:24:34,196 --> 00:24:35,948
What?

178
00:24:36,115 --> 00:24:38,742
Get out!

179
00:24:43,831 --> 00:24:46,500
You never listened to me.

180
00:24:46,709 --> 00:24:50,709
Not when i told you he was a cop
and not now.

181
00:24:51,505 --> 00:24:55,185
You never trusted me.
Now, look where its gotten us

182
00:24:55,342 --> 00:24:58,971
Look at our family now,
i can't go home.

183
00:24:59,179 --> 00:25:03,319
Your sister is stuck in this life
and where is letty Dom?

184
00:25:05,853 --> 00:25:08,856
Where's letty?

185
00:25:34,632 --> 00:25:37,550
Plasma cover, Wilkes i want a list of every place
within 50 miles that distribute compressed gas tank.

186
00:25:37,551 --> 00:25:40,971
Pass me that evidence bag.

187
00:25:45,943 --> 00:25:47,861
Officer Neves, i have been waiting for you.

188
00:25:47,862 --> 00:25:49,722
You asked for me ? I did.

189
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:52,491
May i ask, why?

190
00:25:52,658 --> 00:25:55,995
My smile is not that great.

191
00:25:57,455 --> 00:26:00,331
Your husband was an officer,
who was gunned down in Favela.

192
00:26:00,332 --> 00:26:04,169
Six months later you up and join the force?
You are motivated.

193
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:08,965
Plus i procure you are only the real one
who can't be brought. Am i right?

194
00:26:08,966 --> 00:26:10,676
Yes.
Of course i am.

195
00:26:10,885 --> 00:26:15,135
We have got some bad news.
You don't like my deserve first

196
00:26:15,681 --> 00:26:19,517
I checked the rail-Line like you asked, found a
couple of spots where they unloaded the cars.

197
00:26:19,518 --> 00:26:22,395
One set of tracks headed west until it hit
the main highway and then disappeared

198
00:26:22,396 --> 00:26:26,191
And the another set of tracks headed east
170 inch wheel base, half inch track.

199
00:26:26,192 --> 00:26:33,907
The GT 40 ? -That was missing from the manifest,pretty
easy on this rug. Can't move without leaving signs.

200
00:26:33,908 --> 00:26:34,866
Give me the damn stretches

201
00:26:34,867 --> 00:26:39,237
The ground rolls into a hard pack
and we lost the track too.

202
00:26:39,663 --> 00:26:41,373
Not necessarily.

203
00:26:41,582 --> 00:26:44,459
That road hits through
hill into the favelas

204
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:49,255
Couple of years ago it was washed out by a storm.
So, is dirt from a mile from where you were.

205
00:26:49,256 --> 00:26:52,133
If you headed that way,
you will pickup the tracks there

206
00:26:52,134 --> 00:26:53,844
Come prepared?

207
00:26:54,053 --> 00:26:57,098
I'm motivated.

208
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:01,602
All right then, lets find ourselves a car.

209
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:33,175
What do you think?
Its definitely not just a chip.

210
00:27:33,384 --> 00:27:38,464
Look at all these side menus here,
for data entry. Lets check this one.

211
00:27:42,977 --> 00:27:46,607
Look at that. Same building,
same order every week.

212
00:27:46,772 --> 00:27:50,234
Its a delivery schedule.

213
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:14,592
Drugs? No, that's a dealer pack.

214
00:28:15,551 --> 00:28:19,429
See, the most major player they weigh their money so
they don't have to cost somebody to account it.

215
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:22,098
Right there that's 49 kilos.
49 kilos is a million in twenties.

216
00:28:22,099 --> 00:28:25,018
So, you are saying each one of these
shipment is worth 10 million dollars.

217
00:28:25,019 --> 00:28:27,354
Yeah.

218
00:28:48,167 --> 00:28:50,753
I thought so....

219
00:28:52,004 --> 00:28:56,004
So, what is that?
A 100 million plus in cash oasis?

220
00:28:56,801 --> 00:29:00,471
That how it keeps it off the grid.

221
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:08,738
I can say this one is razor smart about this pack. I mean
its whole network right there, just laid out on its inn

222
00:29:28,456 --> 00:29:31,333
Wilkes and tom go from the
middle, rest flank north

223
00:29:31,334 --> 00:29:33,044
What about me?

224
00:29:33,253 --> 00:29:34,053
Stay here.

225
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:26,199
Police! On the ground!

226
00:31:26,408 --> 00:31:29,369
I got torreto.

227
00:31:33,123 --> 00:31:34,833
Hey! Police!

228
00:31:35,041 --> 00:31:38,211
They already know who you are.

229
00:32:06,698 --> 00:32:09,075
Let's go.

230
00:32:50,784 --> 00:32:53,453
You ok here ? Yeah.

231
00:32:53,661 --> 00:32:56,623
Almost, thank you.

232
00:33:28,696 --> 00:33:32,956
They are gonna be looking for the
three of us together now.

233
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:38,740
We need to split up. You and mia head south
i will lead them away.

234
00:33:38,748 --> 00:33:40,458
No.
Dom's right.

235
00:33:40,667 --> 00:33:43,669
We got lucky to get away, but what happens next time?
We have no choice but to split up

236
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:47,257
I am pregnant

237
00:33:49,676 --> 00:33:53,986
I already lost my family once
I am not gonna do that again.

238
00:33:55,014 --> 00:33:57,892
Are you kidding me?
No.

239
00:34:02,689 --> 00:34:06,689
I'm not going anywhere. Ok.

240
00:34:08,445 --> 00:34:12,445
Dom, promise me we stick together.

241
00:34:18,997 --> 00:34:21,499
I promise.

242
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:29,257
Family just got bigger... ye..H.

243
00:34:44,898 --> 00:34:46,708
Something doesn't add up.

244
00:34:46,816 --> 00:34:48,526
Toretto and O'Conner...

245
00:34:48,735 --> 00:34:53,530
They stay when they are supposed to run
They steal gas and then give it away?

246
00:34:53,531 --> 00:34:56,408
And now they killed three
federal agents?

247
00:34:56,409 --> 00:35:00,246
It doesn't make any sense.
Here's what makes sense.

248
00:35:03,917 --> 00:35:09,797
All these guys names are on a list. They come up, we
take'em down.Not a phone call more, not a bullet less.

249
00:35:09,798 --> 00:35:12,509
Wilkes! We get anything?

250
00:35:12,675 --> 00:35:15,552
Standard forensics, sweep prints,
hair fibers. Prints are all over the car

251
00:35:15,553 --> 00:35:16,512
Anything else?

252
00:35:16,513 --> 00:35:19,389
Yeah, we track the owner
off the vehicle ID

253
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:26,146
They are couple of shell companies in between a
corporation owned by a investor named Hernan Reyes.

254
00:35:26,147 --> 00:35:27,857
Investor?

255
00:35:28,066 --> 00:35:31,902
If there is anything illegal
happening in Rio, Reyes is involved.

256
00:35:31,903 --> 00:35:32,861
Okay, then so are we.

257
00:35:32,862 --> 00:35:35,739
If you can ***
I want every thing on him

258
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:38,616
Chato, be on the roof. I want you on watch
in case somebody comes back for something

259
00:35:38,617 --> 00:35:42,453
Mac give me a cross-Check on Reyes, full specs, he goes
to the john, i want to know how many times he shakes it

260
00:35:42,454 --> 00:35:45,707
You got it boss

261
00:35:47,209 --> 00:35:49,920
Lets put all this mess together.

262
00:35:50,087 --> 00:35:52,964
Well, that's gonna take a while.
- Then you better get started.

263
00:35:52,965 --> 00:35:54,882
They were taking this
car apart for a reason.

264
00:35:54,883 --> 00:35:58,883
Lets put it back together
and find out whats missing.

265
00:36:23,662 --> 00:36:27,416
Hey Dom, what do you remember
about your father?

266
00:36:28,459 --> 00:36:31,170
My father...

267
00:36:37,092 --> 00:36:40,928
He used to....he used to
have a barbeque every sunday after church

268
00:36:41,029 --> 00:36:44,658
For everybody in the neighbourhood.

269
00:36:44,867 --> 00:36:48,703
If we didn't go to church
we didn't get any barbeque.

270
00:36:48,704 --> 00:36:51,373
Every single day he was in the shop

271
00:36:51,582 --> 00:36:57,952
And, every single night he was at the kitchen
table with mia helping her with her homework.

272
00:36:58,297 --> 00:37:07,037
Even after she went to sleep he would
stay up for few more hours.

273
00:37:07,038 --> 00:37:08,038
So he could learn the next chapter and help her next day

274
00:37:08,807 --> 00:37:11,560
I remember everything about my father.

275
00:37:11,727 --> 00:37:14,104
Everything.

276
00:37:14,605 --> 00:37:16,315
That's just it.

277
00:37:16,523 --> 00:37:19,860
I Don't know shit about my dad

278
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:25,156
I don't remember him yelling,
I don't remember him smiling.

279
00:37:25,157 --> 00:37:29,952
To be honest with you,
I don't remember what the hell he look like

280
00:37:29,953 --> 00:37:33,453
I had all the memories....he is just
never there

281
00:37:37,628 --> 00:37:41,340
You ain't gonna be like that Brian

282
00:37:55,812 --> 00:37:58,524
We can't keep running Dom

283
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:00,442
We got to get out

284
00:38:00,609 --> 00:38:03,320
We got to get out, now.

285
00:38:03,487 --> 00:38:06,114
You're right.

286
00:38:15,999 --> 00:38:19,628
This is how we are gonna do it.

287
00:38:21,755 --> 00:38:23,631
We are gonna use this
into one last job.

288
00:38:23,632 --> 00:38:26,343
We are gonna take all the Reyes money

289
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:30,510
Every dime of it.

290
00:38:31,306 --> 00:38:34,852
And then, disappear.....forever

291
00:38:38,981 --> 00:38:42,817
New passports, new life,
and no more looking over our shoulder

292
00:38:42,818 --> 00:38:44,735
And we are just gonna buy our freeDom.
- That's right.

293
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:47,613
You realize we are talking about going up
against most powerful guy in all over Rio.

294
00:38:47,614 --> 00:38:49,825
Yes. We are.

295
00:38:50,492 --> 00:38:53,954
Then we are gonna need a team.

296
00:38:59,168 --> 00:39:01,085
Alright, lets go through the basics
real quick.

297
00:39:01,086 --> 00:39:02,044
What do we got?

298
00:39:02,045 --> 00:39:05,840
First, we are gonna need a chameleon.
Someone who can blend in

299
00:39:05,841 --> 00:39:08,343
Anywhere.

300
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:09,519
What else?

301
00:39:09,678 --> 00:39:14,178
A fast talker. Someone who can
bullshit the way out of anything

302
00:39:14,474 --> 00:39:17,144
I got that.

303
00:39:17,352 --> 00:39:23,107
These guys are gonna have a lot of surveillance we are
gonna need someone who can schedule the circuits.

304
00:39:23,108 --> 00:39:25,026
And with those circuits,
Reyes is gonna have a "wall"

305
00:39:25,027 --> 00:39:29,287
We are gonna need the guys
who can punch through those wall

306
00:39:30,782 --> 00:39:32,700
What else? Utilities and weapons

307
00:39:32,701 --> 00:39:36,537
Someone who ain't afraid to throw down
someone who backup every position

308
00:39:36,538 --> 00:39:40,538
Yeah? What else we need ?

309
00:39:42,294 --> 00:39:44,170
Most importantly we are gonna
need two persistent drivers

310
00:39:44,171 --> 00:39:46,924
Guys who don't crack under pressure.

311
00:39:47,049 --> 00:39:49,801
Guys who never lose.

312
00:39:49,968 --> 00:39:53,096
You know we got that.

313
00:40:17,788 --> 00:40:20,207
Ah.....hell not

314
00:40:20,666 --> 00:40:23,501
I see they really stared the
bottom of the beer..Huh

315
00:40:23,502 --> 00:40:27,172
I guess they did, since your ass is here.

316
00:40:27,339 --> 00:40:30,216
When you are gonna give martin
luther king his car back?

317
00:40:30,217 --> 00:40:34,217
As soon as you give rick james
his jacket back.

318
00:40:49,403 --> 00:40:51,113
Sexy legs baby girl.

319
00:40:51,321 --> 00:40:53,031
What time do they open?

320
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:57,240
They open the same time
when i pull this trigger

321
00:40:58,036 --> 00:41:01,540
Want me to open them?

322
00:41:06,369 --> 00:41:10,369
Yeah anybody can talk shit
in spanish

323
00:41:16,321 --> 00:41:18,991
Two fails, i am not fail.....two fails

324
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:22,077
Who are these clowns men?
Circus clowns

325
00:41:25,914 --> 00:41:27,714
I see, you have all met.

326
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:29,584
Here he is.

327
00:41:29,751 --> 00:41:37,101
You know when you called me to come to Rio, i assumed
it would be for something more exciting than this

328
00:41:41,305 --> 00:41:45,099
This is Tej, the best
circuit men in the east coast.

329
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:48,936
This is my boy Roman Pearce, we go way back
from juvenile

330
00:41:48,937 --> 00:41:50,855
I pulled that job with him Miami.

331
00:41:50,856 --> 00:41:55,176
I heard about you. - Nice stakes.
Yeah, the rest were sold out.

332
00:41:55,652 --> 00:41:58,322
So, whats this all about Dom?

333
00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:01,406
Yeah man, why you drag us
half way around the world.

334
00:42:01,407 --> 00:42:04,076
Because we got a job.

335
00:42:04,285 --> 00:42:07,155
Alright, so target's name is Hernan Reyes.

336
00:42:07,163 --> 00:42:09,080
He runs the drug scene out there

337
00:42:09,081 --> 00:42:10,999
He has never been busted because
he doesn't leave a paper trail.

338
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,836
No paper trails means no banks.
No banks means cash houses.

339
00:42:14,837 --> 00:42:15,795
That's right.

340
00:42:15,796 --> 00:42:19,342
To tell you exact, its
spread throughout the city

341
00:42:20,593 --> 00:42:24,263
And we are gonna hit them all?

342
00:42:24,388 --> 00:42:25,347
All of them.
All of them

343
00:42:25,348 --> 00:42:31,588
Sounds crazy. Bring us to whole another country
so, that we can rob the dude who runs it

344
00:42:32,104 --> 00:42:33,974
I thought this is business

345
00:42:34,023 --> 00:42:36,692
Sounds personal to me.

346
00:42:36,901 --> 00:42:39,695
Is that what this is?

347
00:42:40,738 --> 00:42:43,615
I got love for you all,
but personal ain't good business

348
00:42:43,616 --> 00:42:46,786
I can't do this homie.

349
00:42:47,453 --> 00:42:51,363
So, what we are talking about
is a 100 million dollar.

350
00:42:52,249 --> 00:42:54,919
You sa..Y...wha...t ? Hun...hun...

351
00:42:55,127 --> 00:42:58,964
See, sometimes i be over-Thinking maybe
and you know i know...we just met...but.

352
00:42:58,965 --> 00:42:59,923
You just kinda...gotta.

353
00:42:59,924 --> 00:43:00,882
A 100 million dollars.

354
00:43:00,883 --> 00:43:04,636
And everything we take,
we split even.

355
00:43:04,637 --> 00:43:07,657
So, that's 11 million a piece,
I am down

356
00:43:08,474 --> 00:43:10,893
I am in

357
00:43:11,352 --> 00:43:15,188
11 million? Sounds like a whole
lotta vaginal activity to me.

358
00:43:15,189 --> 00:43:19,025
You can't pull off all the heist
on the same mark, you just can't.

359
00:43:19,026 --> 00:43:23,863
Yeah, as soon as we hit the first one they are gonna
do everything they can to protect their assets.

360
00:43:23,864 --> 00:43:26,450
Exactly.

361
00:44:18,544 --> 00:44:19,502
That's all of it.

362
00:44:19,503 --> 00:44:22,233
You're dead men. You're all dead men.

363
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:25,343
You don't have a place to hide.

364
00:44:26,177 --> 00:44:27,929
Who is hiding?

365
00:44:28,095 --> 00:44:30,972
Are you crazy ? Are you crazy?
Do you know whose house this is?

366
00:44:30,973 --> 00:44:34,810
Whose money are you stealing?

367
00:44:43,444 --> 00:44:46,614
We ain't stealing.

368
00:44:53,996 --> 00:44:57,625
You tell your boss, exactly who did this.

369
00:44:57,833 --> 00:45:01,833
Tell him there is more coming

370
00:45:04,507 --> 00:45:06,300
Wallah...

371
00:45:06,425 --> 00:45:08,970
Turn it over

372
00:45:13,182 --> 00:45:16,310
Its running alright, checks out fine.

373
00:45:18,938 --> 00:45:21,607
Keep looking.

374
00:45:22,775 --> 00:45:26,775
Boss, if something was missing
we would know.

375
00:45:51,512 --> 00:45:54,973
Its a goddamn shame to put a bullshit
like that on a classic

376
00:45:54,974 --> 00:45:58,974
Here, as well slap some on light on it.

377
00:46:06,902 --> 00:46:08,613
They took the chip.

378
00:46:08,821 --> 00:46:11,490
We got a hit on the police scanner.

379
00:46:11,699 --> 00:46:14,910
Armed robbery in the house of golan.

380
00:46:15,536 --> 00:46:19,372
Alright if that's our guys then whatever was
on that chip led them directly to that house.

381
00:46:19,373 --> 00:46:21,125
Its them for sure.

382
00:46:21,167 --> 00:46:27,057
How do you know that ? - Because no one
else in Rio is stupid enough to rob Reyes.

383
00:48:08,065 --> 00:48:11,235
Number 1 is in motion.

384
00:48:23,456 --> 00:48:26,625
Two is on the move.

385
00:48:49,314 --> 00:48:51,858
Yeah, i got mine

386
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:13,338
I got eyes on five

387
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:41,115
I know you said they were consolidating
money somewhere

388
00:49:41,116 --> 00:49:44,494
But you all ain't gonna believe it.

389
00:49:53,586 --> 00:49:56,386
Well, this job has got a little harder.

390
00:49:56,464 --> 00:50:02,584
If he is moving it into a police station he
has got some serious brass in his pocket.

391
00:50:03,179 --> 00:50:04,138
Hell yeah, we can't do this.

392
00:50:04,139 --> 00:50:07,684
We can't or we shouldn't.

393
00:50:07,976 --> 00:50:11,229
I think it doesn't change a thing

394
00:50:13,732 --> 00:50:15,649
I say we stick to the plan.

395
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:21,690
You say wha...this shit just went from mission
impossible to mission freakin' insanity.

396
00:50:22,365 --> 00:50:24,075
Whatever man!

397
00:50:24,284 --> 00:50:31,334
I ain't scared. I am just lettin you all know..
Going in that bouty, its just crazy. - I got this.

398
00:50:31,958 --> 00:50:32,916
What time is robbery

399
00:50:32,917 --> 00:50:35,211
Around 11' o clock

400
00:50:36,755 --> 00:50:39,341
Here we go

401
00:50:40,592 --> 00:50:42,969
Enhance it.

402
00:50:43,428 --> 00:50:46,640
There faces are covered.
Run it through FRS.

403
00:50:52,103 --> 00:50:54,689
Well, hello you son of a bitch.

404
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:01,695
Wilkes, run the photos of known associates of torretto and
O'Conner against custom entries in brazil within last 2 weeks.

405
00:51:01,696 --> 00:51:06,976
Check planes, trains, boats and everything
short of a goddamn space shuttle.

406
00:51:11,289 --> 00:51:14,166
They can change their names
but, they can't change their faces.

407
00:51:14,167 --> 00:51:17,504
Something big is going down.

408
00:51:18,004 --> 00:51:18,963
That's a 1970 charger.

409
00:51:18,964 --> 00:51:19,764
Let's go.

410
00:51:19,923 --> 00:51:20,881
Upload these facts into the database
have the computer cross-Check them with

411
00:51:20,882 --> 00:51:25,452
The overhead satellites at every 15 minutes.
Stand behind in two.

412
00:51:25,637 --> 00:51:30,657
If these vehicles move on the streets
of Rio, i wanna know about them.

413
00:52:47,052 --> 00:52:50,221
The beauty of police offices.

414
00:52:50,889 --> 00:52:52,599
A blueprint?

415
00:52:52,807 --> 00:52:57,603
This is where they are keeping the money.
The vault's in the evidence room.

416
00:52:57,604 --> 00:53:03,359
Yeah..Um. Can i get everyone's attention right here for a
second, we are talkin about breaking into a po-lice station.

417
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:07,072
Is anyone listening to those words?
Anybody? Po-Po.

418
00:53:09,115 --> 00:53:11,033
Five o, one time, peaks
people we don't like.

419
00:53:11,034 --> 00:53:13,911
You know police stations are designed
actually to let people in and out.

420
00:53:13,912 --> 00:53:17,748
That's why its a stealth mission.
We move in and out before they even know we are there.

421
00:53:17,749 --> 00:53:19,625
Well, we need to get eyes in there.

422
00:53:19,626 --> 00:53:23,463
At least, to find out the
model of that vault.

423
00:53:26,341 --> 00:53:30,220
Who's the folk you know, do all this.

424
00:53:37,894 --> 00:53:39,604
Wait...wha do you mean?

425
00:53:39,713 --> 00:53:41,423
Why me?

426
00:53:41,631 --> 00:53:44,968
Because, Out of all of us, you
got the biggest mouth.

427
00:53:54,102 --> 00:53:55,812
That is for damn certain.

428
00:53:56,021 --> 00:53:58,856
Hello beautiful......look at those dimples
sexy.........sexy.

429
00:53:58,857 --> 00:54:00,774
Love those glasses,
where did you get them from.

430
00:54:00,775 --> 00:54:03,987
Is it gucci frames or somethin?

431
00:54:04,613 --> 00:54:07,282
No, no...

432
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:08,449
Who are you sir?

433
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:12,286
Special agent O'Conner.
Us federal bureo of investigation.

434
00:54:12,287 --> 00:54:14,998
It says caucasian?

435
00:54:15,165 --> 00:54:17,615
Well, its the tan....you know tan.

436
00:54:20,921 --> 00:54:24,798
Look....i am working this case
and i got some evidence here to be held.

437
00:54:24,799 --> 00:54:26,717
But i need to get in....and check your
storage facility first.

438
00:54:26,718 --> 00:54:30,554
Nope. - Look man i know you are a true
professional and i respects you, i promise.

439
00:54:30,555 --> 00:54:40,175
You know...it look like you workout a little bit too.
Whats you benchmark 3-350.

440
00:54:38,188 --> 00:54:43,765
My boss sent me here to just make sure
everything was safe.

441
00:54:43,266 --> 00:54:46,243
It will be safe. - Ok..Well let me
just come in and take a quick peek.

442
00:54:43,944 --> 00:54:46,713
Nope. - Come on man.

443
00:54:46,821 --> 00:54:47,780
Hook a brother up please.

444
00:54:47,781 --> 00:54:51,597
No. And you are not my brother.

445
00:54:51,698 --> 00:54:53,616
Brother from another mother?

446
00:54:53,617 --> 00:54:56,735
Look..No one enters the facility
but authorized evidence personnel

447
00:54:56,736 --> 00:54:58,346
Now stop wasting my time.

448
00:54:55,454 --> 00:54:56,412
I am going to call
the embassy. No...no, no.

449
00:54:56,413 --> 00:54:59,290
We good...we don't need to call them..For
what?

450
00:54:59,291 --> 00:55:00,091
We good.

451
00:55:00,251 --> 00:55:03,127
Here, i got the box.
We all good, i promise you.

452
00:55:03,128 --> 00:55:05,840
Thank you so much for your time

453
00:55:06,006 --> 00:55:13,456
I swore to god, if I was on the other side of the
glass I will bust your damn face and translate that.

454
00:55:28,070 --> 00:55:32,730
You see, I think I make a better
special agent than you ever did

455
00:55:32,867 --> 00:55:36,867
Well, that depends on how you
define special.

456
00:55:37,663 --> 00:55:41,663
Oh..Man, lets see what we got.
Have fun.

457
00:55:41,793 --> 00:55:42,963
Alright come on.

458
00:55:53,971 --> 00:55:59,684
Though, you still can drive. You see...
now i see why you always gettin accidents

459
00:55:59,685 --> 00:56:02,385
You can't drive a damn
remote control car

460
00:56:02,485 --> 00:56:04,062
I don't need this, i don't....
-Its a crisis. -Shut up right now.

461
00:56:04,063 --> 00:56:07,583
I am not gonna shut up...
alright, strap him in his safety belt...man.

462
00:56:10,279 --> 00:56:16,034
Give me the remote...going left. Its look like
something right over there to the left...what is that?

463
00:56:16,035 --> 00:56:17,745
Bingo.

464
00:56:17,953 --> 00:56:20,623
What is this ? 6 x 6?

465
00:56:20,831 --> 00:56:22,541
8 x 12

466
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:25,961
7 x 12. 18-Inch thick steel. Re-Enforced wall, with
insulated copper core to protect it against thermal lance.

467
00:56:25,962 --> 00:56:31,352
The class 3 electronical lock would sure fire..
And a biometric palm scanner.

468
00:56:35,221 --> 00:56:37,138
Ten times the top of the line security.

469
00:56:37,139 --> 00:56:41,139
Do i wanna know, how you know all that?

470
00:56:42,687 --> 00:56:42,852
I had a life before you know me O'Conner.
Lets just leave it with that, alright.

471
00:56:42,853 --> 00:56:44,605
She is a beauty, though.

472
00:56:44,772 --> 00:56:46,482
Beauty as in good?

473
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:49,567
Beauty as in you know...
start off playing hard to get

474
00:56:49,568 --> 00:56:58,058
And, no matter how much i caress her, no matter how much i
love her in the end she still ain't gonna give up that ass

475
00:58:18,782 --> 00:58:22,036
I got this....relax man relax.

476
00:59:38,362 --> 00:59:41,073
Got it...we got it.

477
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:43,199
Yeah...we are looking at four cameras.

478
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:47,037
Now, that's some high end shit too.
Marker optics.

479
00:59:47,997 --> 00:59:51,208
They refill the view,
10 seconds oscillation.

480
00:59:52,793 --> 00:59:53,751
Nah...that's a narrow window man?

481
00:59:53,752 --> 00:59:56,629
Can we just stop the scanner
and replace the image.

482
00:59:56,630 --> 00:59:58,506
Nah...its hooked up into a digital sync.
Ain't no way around the system.

483
00:59:58,507 --> 01:00:00,425
The best we can do is peek.

484
01:00:00,426 --> 01:00:02,343
We are gonna need some real
fast cars to get to this.

485
01:00:02,344 --> 01:00:04,262
And, not just fast...
we need a hard ride and air

486
01:00:04,263 --> 01:00:07,433
We need something agile.

487
01:00:09,059 --> 01:00:10,919
You guys mark up a track.

488
01:00:10,978 --> 01:00:14,978
O'Conner, lets go get some cars.

489
01:00:15,122 --> 01:00:23,122
....Interval...Go have something!
//subs dedicated to ma mom and bumbo//

490
01:00:52,228 --> 01:00:55,397
Home...sweet home.

491
01:01:12,373 --> 01:01:15,041
Now that.

492
01:01:15,068 --> 01:01:19,044
How about that?, all motors and no tuning issues?
I always wanted one of those.

493
01:01:19,045 --> 01:01:23,045
Held the record on the
envadeda 3 years running.

494
01:01:23,842 --> 01:01:26,718
You got a lot of bones to bring
your problems here torreto

495
01:01:26,719 --> 01:01:30,390
Not to mention a cop

496
01:01:30,598 --> 01:01:33,852
Yeah, we can keep that on the low

497
01:01:33,913 --> 01:01:36,690
Word on the street is that a
lot of people are looking for you two.

498
01:01:36,791 --> 01:01:41,120
But, you didn't think
we would recognise you

499
01:01:41,228 --> 01:01:43,828
Well, what kind of car you own

500
01:01:44,177 --> 01:01:51,277
That little cool may run the street around here but
that monster has never seen a set ot tail lights, ever

501
01:01:51,278 --> 01:01:53,513
Well she is about to.

502
01:02:01,254 --> 01:02:04,257
Lets go......legend

503
01:02:06,050 --> 01:02:07,760
Car for a car.

504
01:02:07,969 --> 01:02:09,679
Car for car?

505
01:02:09,888 --> 01:02:13,641
If you want it, come and get it.

506
01:02:23,359 --> 01:02:25,820
Really?

507
01:02:26,237 --> 01:02:29,907
Whe..Whe..Where did you get that from?
Popa's mark.

508
01:02:30,074 --> 01:02:33,995
Ok O'Conner, give me your best shot.

509
01:02:54,015 --> 01:02:56,684
How was that one ? Camera caught you.

510
01:02:56,893 --> 01:02:59,770
What? Yeah it still caught you - Then i
will milk the hell out of that thing too.

511
01:02:59,771 --> 01:03:03,399
We are gonna need a faster car.

512
01:03:26,631 --> 01:03:30,891
Exactly why your ass ain't been
driving. You gotta re-Blaze

513
01:03:39,102 --> 01:03:42,355
I think, i am in love.

514
01:03:44,858 --> 01:03:48,694
That was a real solid work but
i think camera 3 still caught you though.

515
01:03:48,695 --> 01:03:51,948
Let's do it again.

516
01:03:59,205 --> 01:04:02,709
That's your piggy bank ? You kiddin me
yup?

517
01:04:03,042 --> 01:04:05,832
Where the hell can i get one of these?

518
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:10,550
Well we had a life
before you met us.

519
01:04:10,758 --> 01:04:12,676
Alright, well i get to work
on the electronics tunneler

520
01:04:12,677 --> 01:04:15,346
But there's still another problem

521
01:04:15,555 --> 01:04:17,265
Palm scanner

522
01:04:17,473 --> 01:04:21,310
And without Reyes hand-Print,
Houdini himself can not open this bitch.

523
01:04:21,311 --> 01:04:23,228
How do you know its Reyes's hand-Print?

524
01:04:23,229 --> 01:04:25,147
You got 100 million dollars in a safe

525
01:04:25,148 --> 01:04:28,693
You gonna put somebody
else's hand-Print on it.

526
01:04:36,659 --> 01:04:38,535
How are we supposed to get
Reyes's hand-Print?

527
01:04:38,536 --> 01:04:41,539
Han, you are up.

528
01:04:42,373 --> 01:04:45,084
Sure, gotta make the easy stuff.

529
01:04:45,251 --> 01:04:48,546
Lets go, i will drive.

530
01:05:04,479 --> 01:05:05,437
That makes six bodyguards.

531
01:05:05,438 --> 01:05:09,808
Seven, do you think that guy with
a funny look is a tourist?

532
01:05:15,031 --> 01:05:18,535
So, how long were you in the army?

533
01:05:25,542 --> 01:05:29,922
I got out of military probably the same
time you quit smoking

534
01:05:32,257 --> 01:05:34,174
The amount of chips you ate.

535
01:05:34,175 --> 01:05:38,011
The way you always had to keep
your hands and mouth busy

536
01:05:38,012 --> 01:05:41,641
You are a two packs a day.
For sure

537
01:05:41,850 --> 01:05:44,477
Un-Filtered.

538
01:05:47,605 --> 01:05:49,357
Well, this is a bust.

539
01:05:49,524 --> 01:05:53,194
How you gonna get Reyes
fingerprint out of here

540
01:05:53,361 --> 01:05:55,279
You need to do some more recon.

541
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:57,031
Kinda couple extra guys.

542
01:05:57,198 --> 01:06:01,119
Alright, you don't send a man
to do a woman's job

543
01:06:54,756 --> 01:06:57,884
We gonna figure this out, i promise you.

544
01:07:00,512 --> 01:07:03,097
Whats up?

545
01:07:03,389 --> 01:07:05,307
I thought she was more of a thong man?

546
01:07:05,308 --> 01:07:07,018
We got the prints.

547
01:07:07,227 --> 01:07:09,479
Where?

548
01:07:11,064 --> 01:07:13,942
Ok. That's crazy.

549
01:07:14,901 --> 01:07:16,818
So, did he just like slap that ass

550
01:07:16,819 --> 01:07:19,989
Or, did he like grab and hold on to it?

551
01:07:21,574 --> 01:07:24,118
Yeah..Hey...this will work.

552
01:07:24,452 --> 01:07:26,202
I'm impressed. - Got it?

553
01:07:26,371 --> 01:07:30,371
Got it. But, you still
didn't answer the question.

554
01:07:35,964 --> 01:07:37,881
Guys...guys...guys....we have a problem.

555
01:07:37,882 --> 01:07:41,881
The whole team just got burned
now we are all wanted.

556
01:07:44,638 --> 01:07:46,348
Hang on a second.

557
01:07:46,557 --> 01:07:49,433
Us diplomatic security service
issued the warrants.

558
01:07:49,434 --> 01:07:52,187
Agent L.Hobbs.
Hold on a second.

559
01:07:53,272 --> 01:07:55,649
Hey Dom,

560
01:07:56,149 --> 01:07:59,778
Is that the guy you saw in the favela ?

561
01:07:59,945 --> 01:08:01,697
Yeah.

562
01:08:01,864 --> 01:08:04,740
Hobbs is the leader of the
elite task force for the DSS.

563
01:08:04,741 --> 01:08:06,451
So. He is good?

564
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:08,578
When the FBI wants to find somebody
that's who they call.

565
01:08:08,579 --> 01:08:11,248
Because he never misses his mark.

566
01:08:11,456 --> 01:08:14,126
This guy is....he is old testament.

567
01:08:14,334 --> 01:08:17,211
Blood, bullets, rap the GOD
that's his style.

568
01:08:17,212 --> 01:08:19,130
And right now he is hunting us?

569
01:08:19,131 --> 01:08:21,048
Dom, we are gonna move up
our time line.

570
01:08:21,049 --> 01:08:22,759
Yes, but how?

571
01:08:22,968 --> 01:08:26,638
This thing has already been difficult

572
01:08:26,805 --> 01:08:29,682
If it ain't that..
We need more room to breathe.

573
01:08:29,683 --> 01:08:32,561
Roman is right.

574
01:08:34,479 --> 01:08:38,479
We need to get some fresh air.

575
01:08:40,235 --> 01:08:41,987
Its got a hit.

576
01:08:42,154 --> 01:08:44,531
Let's move

577
01:08:50,787 --> 01:08:53,749
Move....move....move

578
01:08:58,462 --> 01:09:00,379
Stopped...about a block ahead.

579
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:03,550
Park it...we are going on foot.

580
01:09:24,321 --> 01:09:26,740
Hey.......toretto.

581
01:09:32,996 --> 01:09:34,706
You're under arrest.

582
01:09:34,915 --> 01:09:36,625
Arrest?

583
01:09:36,834 --> 01:09:39,504
I don't feel like i am under arrest.

584
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:40,670
How about you brian?

585
01:09:40,671 --> 01:09:43,257
Nah....not a bit.

586
01:09:43,549 --> 01:09:48,439
Not even a little bit.
I will just give a minute...it will sink in.

587
01:09:50,264 --> 01:09:52,181
We didn't kill those feds.

588
01:09:52,182 --> 01:09:54,100
That's Reyes. I don't give a shit.

589
01:09:54,101 --> 01:09:57,895
Just here to bring in two assholes
whose names hit my desk.

590
01:09:57,896 --> 01:10:01,733
Yeah, that's sound like a real hero.

591
01:10:02,693 --> 01:10:04,444
That's funny

592
01:10:04,611 --> 01:10:09,825
From a guy who took the oath of a cop and
then went against everything he stood for?

593
01:10:09,826 --> 01:10:12,285
Or, some wanna be tough guy prick who beat
a man half to death with a socket rinch.

594
01:10:12,286 --> 01:10:14,037
That real tough.

595
01:10:14,204 --> 01:10:18,204
You turn around and put
hands behind your back.

596
01:10:19,001 --> 01:10:24,591
I don't think so. - You are so mistaken
to think you got a goddamn choice boy

597
01:10:27,676 --> 01:10:31,676
Your mistake ? Thinking you are in america.

598
01:10:33,432 --> 01:10:36,643
You're a long way from home.

599
01:10:39,146 --> 01:10:42,149
This is brazil!

600
01:10:55,454 --> 01:10:59,082
Come on boss, another day.

601
01:10:59,291 --> 01:11:03,128
Come on, its way too heat.

602
01:11:06,965 --> 01:11:10,636
I will see you soon, toretto.

603
01:11:10,802 --> 01:11:14,056
I am looking forward to it.

604
01:11:48,215 --> 01:11:49,015
Yep.

605
01:11:49,174 --> 01:11:51,844
Tracker's on.

606
01:11:52,052 --> 01:11:54,638
Got him.

607
01:12:56,283 --> 01:12:58,994
I don't understand. Why come here?

608
01:12:59,161 --> 01:13:03,161
Why risk it all for
20 dollar worth of silver?

609
01:13:06,877 --> 01:13:09,880
Because its worth it.

610
01:13:10,714 --> 01:13:12,464
You should run you know!

611
01:13:12,633 --> 01:13:15,594
Hobbs will find you

612
01:13:16,470 --> 01:13:20,470
You have every reason to leave
why stay ? - Why do you?

613
01:13:29,858 --> 01:13:35,288
My husband was a good police officer...an
honest man...we both grew up here.

614
01:13:37,533 --> 01:13:41,161
Three years ago, has was murdered in
the streets

615
01:13:41,370 --> 01:13:44,122
Right outside out our door.

616
01:13:45,207 --> 01:13:46,959
Reyes owns this place

617
01:13:47,125 --> 01:13:49,837
He give things to people

618
01:13:50,003 --> 01:13:53,465
And, everything has a price.

619
01:13:55,759 --> 01:13:57,677
People here need a new start.

620
01:13:57,678 --> 01:14:00,556
They need to be free.

621
01:14:08,229 --> 01:14:12,229
You didn't killed those men in the train
did you?

622
01:14:15,903 --> 01:14:19,903
Now, why would you believe anything
I would tell you.

623
01:14:25,496 --> 01:14:27,623
Hey!

624
01:14:29,333 --> 01:14:33,333
Was she so special to you?

625
01:14:36,048 --> 01:14:40,048
I never thought anyone could
understand how much.

626
01:14:40,803 --> 01:14:43,598
But you do.

627
01:15:16,255 --> 01:15:18,007
Close, but not enough.

628
01:15:18,174 --> 01:15:20,091
Time window is too small, man.

629
01:15:20,092 --> 01:15:24,122
The only way we can beat the cameras,
is with invisible cars.

630
01:15:25,848 --> 01:15:29,143
And i know, just where to get them

631
01:15:30,645 --> 01:15:33,940
Lets take a ride boys.

632
01:15:39,278 --> 01:15:42,865
Don't hurt yourselfs.

633
01:15:59,423 --> 01:16:01,341
Its been a while since i hv'been behind
the wheel of one of these.

634
01:16:01,342 --> 01:16:05,096
First time I ever been in the front seat

635
01:16:10,935 --> 01:16:12,853
Hey, rom what took you so long.

636
01:16:12,854 --> 01:16:17,649
I thought for sure, you be showing up
with some chrome spinners or somethin.

637
01:16:17,650 --> 01:16:19,360
Ha.....hah....real funny

638
01:16:19,569 --> 01:16:23,405
I got a 100,000 that says i can
take you all in the next quarter mile.

639
01:16:23,406 --> 01:16:25,323
Yeah, you broke that like
you got a 100 grand.

640
01:16:25,324 --> 01:16:28,035
If we pull off this job, I will.

641
01:16:28,202 --> 01:16:30,182
Next two lights, a 100,000.

642
01:16:32,039 --> 01:16:34,916
If we don't pull this job off,
we are probably dead anyway.

643
01:16:34,917 --> 01:16:36,669
Lets, make it a million

644
01:16:36,836 --> 01:16:38,588
I like that.

645
01:16:38,754 --> 01:16:40,672
Alright, million dollar a quarter mile.

646
01:16:40,673 --> 01:16:42,425
Alright then.

647
01:16:42,592 --> 01:16:45,261
We only live once, lets do it.

648
01:16:45,469 --> 01:16:47,180
What do you say Dom?

649
01:16:47,388 --> 01:16:50,057
Are we talking or we racing?

650
01:16:50,266 --> 01:16:52,184
Just don't cheat this time.

651
01:16:52,185 --> 01:16:55,354
You gotta let that go.

652
01:18:10,805 --> 01:18:13,975
Yeah, owned you....owned you.

653
01:18:27,154 --> 01:18:31,117
Good race, O'Conner. Thanks, Dom.

654
01:18:35,746 --> 01:18:36,705
The man right there!

655
01:18:36,706 --> 01:18:39,417
He left off the throttle with a mile.

656
01:18:39,584 --> 01:18:41,335
You didn't do nothing.

657
01:18:41,502 --> 01:18:43,254
He let you win.

658
01:18:43,421 --> 01:18:45,756
Bullshit.

659
01:19:06,444 --> 01:19:07,402
Vince, what are you doing?

660
01:19:07,403 --> 01:19:11,240
Quite, you have been tracked.

661
01:19:37,141 --> 01:19:38,851
Its..Ok...wait.

662
01:19:39,060 --> 01:19:41,937
Reyes's guys were waiting for
me at the market

663
01:19:41,938 --> 01:19:45,316

Good!

B'cause you are saying grace.

668
01:20:01,082 --> 01:20:03,793
Thanks vince.

669
01:20:21,686 --> 01:20:24,063

more than 10-11 million dollars coming.

674
01:20:33,196 --> 01:20:33,996

675
01:20:34,114 --> 01:20:34,914
Yeah.

676
01:20:35,073 --> 01:20:36,991
Actually...man, i have been thinking
about opening up a garage back home.

677
01:20:36,992 --> 01:20:41,495
A place where people can bring their cars, and they
get completely ripped off, you know what I mean?

678
01:20:41,496 --> 01:20:42,414
Really?

679
01:20:42,455 --> 01:20:43,122
Yeah.

680
01:20:43,123 --> 01:20:46,376
So, your dream is to start a day job?

681
01:20:46,585 --> 01:20:48,502
That's...that's stupid...man, why would..

682
01:20:48,503 --> 01:20:49,461
Nah...that's not stupid at all..Man

683
01:20:49,462 --> 01:20:50,421
I love what I do.

684
01:20:50,422 --> 01:20:54,422
You wanna know what i am
gonna do with my money.

685
01:20:56,178 --> 01:20:58,095
Find some cooking lesson for my man.

686
01:20:58,096 --> 01:21:02,126
See, see? There you with that theory man?
You know me...

687
01:21:04,853 --> 01:21:08,689
Its gonna take a little more than
money to learn how to cook...that's all.

688
01:21:08,690 --> 01:21:10,608
But, i heard they were looking for a chef.

689
01:21:10,609 --> 01:21:14,419
Down at this animal shelter.
Where you might....wanna.

690
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:22,537
Hey Dom,

691
01:21:25,916 --> 01:21:29,544
Listen, i know you have a separate
job tomorrow.

692
01:21:29,753 --> 01:21:31,553
If you need an extra men

693
01:21:31,671 --> 01:21:34,341
Mike, you are in

694
01:21:41,264 --> 01:21:44,518
You always have been a family.

695
01:21:48,939 --> 01:21:51,233
Thank you!

696
01:21:53,735 --> 01:21:56,238
Get something to eat.

697
01:21:56,613 --> 01:21:58,698
Yeah

698
01:22:05,247 --> 01:22:08,375
She might be right.

699
01:22:11,962 --> 01:22:14,652
You really like doing that stuff, huh?

700
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:19,620
When your life is on the line,
that's when you manner by yourself.

701
01:22:23,473 --> 01:22:26,726
That's a fair deal?

702
01:22:28,270 --> 01:22:32,106
We are less than 24 hours from biggest
celebration of our life.

703
01:22:32,107 --> 01:22:33,817
You gotta re-fill.

704
01:22:33,984 --> 01:22:35,901
This is some seRious stuff.

705
01:22:35,902 --> 01:22:36,861
No, I am good...I am good...
.No...thank-You!

706
01:22:36,862 --> 01:22:39,614
No, she can't.

707
01:22:39,739 --> 01:22:40,698
What do you mean?

708
01:22:40,699 --> 01:22:42,450
She can't.

709
01:22:42,617 --> 01:22:46,617
What do you mean, she can't?

710
01:22:49,374 --> 01:22:52,043
Are you seRious right now?

711
01:22:52,252 --> 01:22:55,688
Is that the reason you let him beat
you in the quarter mile?

712
01:22:56,789 --> 01:22:57,047
That was a baby gift.

713
01:22:57,048 --> 01:23:00,425
No, that's messed up.
But, still its a baby gift.

714
01:23:00,426 --> 01:23:02,085
No, you are not taking that from me.

715
01:23:02,086 --> 01:23:03,555
Wait, wait...hold on a second.

716
01:23:03,563 --> 01:23:04,722
Did he just smack that ass or,

717
01:23:04,723 --> 01:23:07,601
Did he grab the ass...

718
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:11,605
Thanks .. Thank you ..

719
01:23:11,606 --> 01:23:12,606
Its your boy. Why would you keep
somethin like that away from us.

720
01:23:12,607 --> 01:23:14,177
You did it again, huh

721
01:23:18,111 --> 01:23:21,261
I have no idea what they
are talking about?

722
01:23:26,745 --> 01:23:29,080
Toast!

723
01:23:36,338 --> 01:23:40,338
Money will come and go, we know that.

724
01:23:41,134 --> 01:23:43,052
The most important thing in life

725
01:23:43,053 --> 01:23:45,012
Will always be the people in this room.

726
01:23:45,013 --> 01:23:47,682

01:24:07,035 --> 01:24:09,996

01:24:10,872 --> 01:24:13,333
Yeah, i am always good bro.

731
01:24:16,628 --> 01:24:19,478
Hobbs is on the other side of the city.

732
01:24:19,506 --> 01:24:21,423
We are not gonna get
a better window.

733
01:24:21,424 --> 01:24:24,094
Ok guys, its showtime.

734
01:24:24,302 --> 01:24:28,302
First team in position,
lets go. -Come on lets do this.

735
01:24:38,692 --> 01:24:42,153
Hey Dom, i got eyes on mia

736
01:24:42,154 --> 01:24:43,154
Moscow, berlin, goa, hong kong.
What do they have all in common

737
01:24:43,155 --> 01:24:46,475
We are one hour away from rest of that.
Yeah.

738
01:25:01,715 --> 01:25:04,301
Police!

739
01:25:17,022 --> 01:25:19,733
You just made a big mistake

740
01:25:19,900 --> 01:25:22,776
Took me while to find
out that tracking chip.

741
01:25:22,777 --> 01:25:24,695
But, not as long to flip the receiver.

742
01:25:24,696 --> 01:25:25,654
You're going down torretto.

743
01:25:25,655 --> 01:25:28,200
I'm right here.

744
01:26:51,032 --> 01:26:51,831
Dom!

745
01:26:51,991 --> 01:26:53,701
Stand back, i got this.

746
01:26:59,665 --> 01:27:02,293
Dom, please Dom.

747
01:27:08,299 --> 01:27:10,718
Stop!

748
01:27:17,892 --> 01:27:20,186
Dom!

749
01:28:19,286 --> 01:28:20,996
Yeah?

750
01:28:21,205 --> 01:28:24,083
We are coming in now

751
01:28:25,042 --> 01:28:28,552
Tell the marshals to prepare a
vehicle to home back.

752
01:28:34,593 --> 01:28:37,012
Ambush!

753
01:28:52,820 --> 01:28:56,115
Wilkes, suppressing fire.
Set them down.

754
01:29:00,494 --> 01:29:03,205
Macroy, cover me

755
01:29:06,292 --> 01:29:09,044
Watch that

756
01:29:18,721 --> 01:29:21,891
Cut us loose! Come on!
Cut us loose!

757
01:31:14,753 --> 01:31:18,507
Everything all right? Let's go!
Let's go!

758
01:31:56,003 --> 01:31:57,921
Hey Dom, you didn't meet my son

759
01:31:57,922 --> 01:32:00,132
Nico

760
01:32:03,677 --> 01:32:06,263
I will

761
01:32:08,474 --> 01:32:11,352
He is a good kid

762
01:32:13,270 --> 01:32:16,440
You know, we named him after you

763
01:32:17,107 --> 01:32:19,527
Dominic.

764
01:32:25,741 --> 01:32:28,911
You have my word vince.

765
01:32:33,332 --> 01:32:37,127
You were always my brother.

766
01:32:44,885 --> 01:32:48,305
See, you my brother.

767
01:32:57,356 --> 01:32:59,274
We need to move, we don't
have that much time

768
01:32:59,275 --> 01:33:03,111
I got some flight out,
that leaves Rio-de-janeiro in next 5 hours.

769
01:33:03,112 --> 01:33:05,781
Not to run away....

770
01:33:05,990 --> 01:33:07,700
To finish the job.

771
01:33:07,908 --> 01:33:11,537
Are you crazy Dom ? We can't.

772
01:33:11,745 --> 01:33:14,415
Its a suicide mission.

773
01:33:14,582 --> 01:33:17,457
That's your man over there
on the table.

774
01:33:17,458 --> 01:33:19,376
The plan is busted, this is bullshit man.

775
01:33:19,377 --> 01:33:21,247
Reyes knows we are coming.

776
01:33:21,296 --> 01:33:23,047
He's right.

777
01:33:23,214 --> 01:33:28,704
They tripled the detail of the police
station its gonna be a wall of gunfire.

778
01:33:29,971 --> 01:33:32,640
Reyes doesn't get away with this.

779
01:33:32,849 --> 01:33:35,810
Its a trap man, you know that.

780
01:33:36,686 --> 01:33:38,396
Dom! Listen to them.

781
01:33:38,605 --> 01:33:40,415
Run, before its too late.

782
01:33:40,523 --> 01:33:44,523
Leave Rio, you can be free

783
01:33:45,320 --> 01:33:48,364
I don't need freeDom.

784
01:33:49,157 --> 01:33:52,410
You should know that...

785
01:33:56,789 --> 01:34:00,335
You are all free
to make your own choices

786
01:34:01,586 --> 01:34:04,172
I am in.

787
01:34:11,179 --> 01:34:14,140
I will ride with you toretto.

788
01:34:15,975 --> 01:34:19,646
At least, until we kill that
son of a bitch.

789
01:34:26,569 --> 01:34:29,239
So, whats the plan Dom?

790
01:34:29,447 --> 01:34:32,247
Can't just go sneaking around
any more

791
01:34:32,283 --> 01:34:34,994
We don't sneak

792
01:34:35,161 --> 01:34:38,038
The only thing that he cares
about is his money.

793
01:34:38,039 --> 01:34:41,876
If we pull that, we pull him.

794
01:35:26,004 --> 01:35:28,965
Are you ready?

795
01:35:29,841 --> 01:35:32,635
I'm ready.

796
01:37:30,670 --> 01:37:31,628
Holl it out, mia?

797
01:37:31,629 --> 01:37:34,299
You got a straight shot,

798
01:37:34,507 --> 01:37:37,177
Go right.

799

800
01:37:57,530 --> 01:37:58,489
Wow, the plans working

801
01:37:58,490 --> 01:38:02,490
You guys have every cop car
in Rio on your tail.

802
01:38:04,245 --> 01:38:05,621
Whats the best drop?

803
01:38:05,622 --> 01:38:07,122
Ok..Keep going straight
another half mile at du-Luff-Seeker

804
01:38:07,123 --> 01:38:10,543
And then go left.

805
01:38:13,838 --> 01:38:16,508
It ain't gonna work

806
01:38:16,716 --> 01:38:17,674
Spikes ahead Dom....we got spikes.

807
01:38:17,675 --> 01:38:20,637
We are going right

808
01:38:21,513 --> 01:38:23,305
Nah...its too tight...
we are not gonna fit.

809
01:38:23,306 --> 01:38:25,725
We have no choice.
Now.

810
01:38:43,535 --> 01:38:45,954
Sh...it!

811
01:38:45,955 --> 01:38:46,955
Holy....shit!

812
01:38:53,169 --> 01:38:57,599

Yeah!

821
01:42:09,181 --> 01:42:11,433

822
01:42:11,435 --> 01:42:14,435
Good afternoon officer.

I see you on the other side

828
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:43,700
You guys just copped out a
10 second window, make it count.

829
01:43:32,906 --> 01:43:34,824
No...there is too many of them

830
01:43:34,825 --> 01:43:37,703
We are not gonna make it.

831
01:43:39,621 --> 01:43:41,361
You're right, we aren't

832
01:43:41,540 --> 01:43:44,209
You are.
What are you talking about

833
01:43:44,376 --> 01:43:46,711
Just let the vault go.
Get out of there.

834
01:43:46,712 --> 01:43:48,212
You're father now, brian

836
01:43:51,091 --> 01:43:52,801
It was always the plan.

01:43:53,010 --> 01:43:54,720

840
01:46:50,436 --> 01:46:53,481

That's for my team

843
01:47:18,214 --> 01:47:19,924
Its hell of a mess.

844
01:47:20,132 --> 01:47:22,593
Yeah, it is.

845
01:47:23,766 --> 01:47:28,724
You know, i can't let you two go

01:47:33,563 --> 01:47:35,273
The money stays though.

848
01:47:35,481 --> 01:47:39,181
If i were you, I would probably
use the time

849
01:47:39,186 --> 01:47:42,646

You know what's crazy?

867
01:52:22,103 --> 01:52:25,061
There is only four of those cars
in the whole world.

868
01:52:25,062 --> 01:52:27,939
And i got the only

869
01:52:27,940 --> 01:52:32,479
I made a sheikh in abu dhabi

870
01:52:32,736 --> 01:52:36,572
And, that's a nice lady

878
01:53:00,637 --> 01:53:05,137
So, i guess that means there

879
01:53:05,310 --> 01:53:07,310
Whats your smart ass gotta say now?

880
01:53:07,511 --> 01:53:11,229
Well...you know what,
we can always shine together baby.

881
01:53:11,230 --> 01:53:13,567
Get dressed man,

882
01:53:24,660 --> 01:53:27,296
So, where to now?

883
01:53:27,497 --> 01:53:28,207
I don't know

884
01:53:28,415 --> 01:53:31,085
Never been to madrid.

885
01:53:31,293 --> 01:53:34,211
I thought you wanna go to tokyo..

886
01:53:34,212 --> 01:53:36,756
We will get there...

887
01:53:37,094 --> 01:53:40,597
Eventually...

888
01:54:52,036 --> 01:54:56,913
This is the happiest i have
ever seen my sister

889
01:54:56,914 --> 01:54:59,875
It goes with free.

890

Yeah.

893
01:55:23,155 --> 01:55:28,045
No wagers, no Body-Else
just you and me, once and for all

894
01:55:34,367 --> 01:55:37,184
You sure, you gonna handle
the disappointment?

895
01:55:37,285 --> 01:55:39,871
Are you?

896
01:55:40,422 --> 01:55:42,833
Alright, O'Conner

897
01:55:42,841 --> 01:55:46,294
Lets see what you got

898

Berlin, 3 am this morning.

900
01:56:20,297 --> 01:56:22,497
A team of hikers,
