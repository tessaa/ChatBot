1
00:00:10,627 --> 00:00:13,296
Quantum of Solace

2
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:46,634
SIENA, ITALY

3
00:04:08,406 --> 00:04:10,158
It's time to get out.

4
00:07:38,741 --> 00:07:40,660
Don't bleed to death.

5
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:47,375
- Hello Mitchell.
- Bond.

6
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:50,086
The Americans aren't going to be
none too pleased about this.

7
00:07:50,086 --> 00:07:52,380
I promised them Le Chiffre
and they got Le Chiffre.

8
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,840
They got his body.

9
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,843
If they'd wanted his soul they should
have made a deal with a priest.

10
00:07:57,802 --> 00:07:59,262
Has he said anything?

11
00:07:59,262 --> 00:08:00,305
No.

12
00:08:00,305 --> 00:08:02,348
Going to check perimeters, Ma'am.

13
00:08:04,267 --> 00:08:05,935
You look like hell.

14
00:08:05,935 --> 00:08:09,355
When was the last time you slept?

15
00:08:09,606 --> 00:08:12,901
Vesper's boyfriend, Yusef Kabira,
the one who was abducted in Morocco...

16
00:08:12,901 --> 00:08:14,611
the one she was trying to save.

17
00:08:14,611 --> 00:08:17,405
His body was washed up on
a beach near Ibiza.

18
00:08:17,405 --> 00:08:19,616
We were meant to believe
the fish did that to his face.

19
00:08:19,616 --> 00:08:21,910
His wallet and ID were in his pocket.

20
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,786
- Well that's convenient.
- Quite.

21
00:08:23,786 --> 00:08:25,788
Which is why I did a DNA check
on a lock of his hair...

22
00:08:25,788 --> 00:08:27,874
found in Vesper's apartment.

23
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,250
It's not him.

24
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,919
A lock of his hair?

25
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:34,255
I wouldn't have thought
Vesper's the sentimental type.

26
00:08:34,255 --> 00:08:37,759
Well, we never really know anyone,
do we?

27
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:40,803
But I do need to know Bond...

28
00:08:40,803 --> 00:08:44,224
I need to know
that I can trust you.

29
00:08:44,265 --> 00:08:45,266
And you don't?

30
00:08:45,266 --> 00:08:48,102
He'd need to be a pretty cold
bastard who didn't want revenge...

31
00:08:48,102 --> 00:08:49,646
for the death of someone he loved.

32
00:08:49,646 --> 00:08:51,606
You don't have to worry about me.

33
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:56,110
I'm not gonna go chasing him.
He's not important.

34
00:08:57,528 --> 00:08:59,614
And neither is she.

35
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,741
It's clear, Ma'am.

36
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:03,284
Thanks, Mitchell.

37
00:09:03,284 --> 00:09:04,994
Shall we?

38
00:09:22,804 --> 00:09:25,306
You're gonna tell us who you work for?

39
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:29,269
I was always very interested
to meet you.

40
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:31,688
I'd heard so much
about you from Vesper.

41
00:09:31,688 --> 00:09:33,398
In fact, the real shame is that...

42
00:09:33,398 --> 00:09:37,110
if she hadn't killed herself,
we would've had you too.

43
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,904
I think you would have done
anything for her.

44
00:09:39,904 --> 00:09:43,741
Well, you know you're not in Britain,
and God knows where you'll be tomorrow.

45
00:09:43,741 --> 00:09:45,743
Which should tell you
that eventually...

46
00:09:45,743 --> 00:09:48,454
you'll tell us about the people
you work with...

47
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:52,166
and the longer it takes,
the more painful we"ll make it.

48
00:09:54,711 --> 00:09:59,173
You really don't know
anything about us.

49
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:04,888
It's so amusing, because we on
the other side... thinking, oh...

50
00:10:04,888 --> 00:10:07,432
the MI-6, the CIA, they're
looking over our shoulders...

51
00:10:07,432 --> 00:10:09,684
they're listening
to our conversations...

52
00:10:09,684 --> 00:10:12,687
and the truth is,
you don't even know we exist.

53
00:10:12,687 --> 00:10:16,566
Oh, we do know, Mr White...
and we are quick learners.

54
00:10:19,277 --> 00:10:23,114
Well, then, the first thing
you should know about us is...

55
00:10:23,114 --> 00:10:25,617
that we have people everywhere.

56
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:27,410
Am I right?

57
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,182
Oh, my God... what inhumanity!

58
00:15:41,724 --> 00:15:43,601
Anything?

59
00:15:44,018 --> 00:15:46,729
Craig Mitchell worked for me for 8 years.

60
00:15:46,729 --> 00:15:49,983
He passed a full security check
and lie detector test every year.

61
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:53,361
He didn't leave so much as a scrap
of paper to explain any of it.

62
00:15:53,361 --> 00:15:56,197
Eight years,
five as my personal bodyguard.

63
00:15:56,197 --> 00:15:57,407
I found this...

64
00:15:57,407 --> 00:16:00,201
and 3 other bloody Christmas presents
I bought him, about the house.

65
00:16:00,201 --> 00:16:02,161
I don't think he smoked.

66
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:04,914
And you had to kill him! You couldn't
bring him in for questioning...

67
00:16:04,914 --> 00:16:07,000
so we might actually
learn something.

68
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,877
When someone says:
"We've got people everywhere"...

69
00:16:08,877 --> 00:16:10,378
you expect it to be hyperbole.

70
00:16:10,378 --> 00:16:11,671
Lots of people saying that...

71
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:13,089
Florists use that expression.

72
00:16:13,089 --> 00:16:17,176
It doesn't mean they've got someone
working for them inside the bloody room.

73
00:16:17,427 --> 00:16:19,679
What the hell
is this organization, Bond?

74
00:16:19,762 --> 00:16:22,390
How can they be everywhere and
we know nothing about them?

75
00:16:23,933 --> 00:16:26,853
- I assume we found no trace of White.
- No, ma'am.

76
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:30,607
The agent guarding the door in the garage
was dead before you passed him on the stairs.

77
00:16:30,607 --> 00:16:32,567
I passed him on the stairs?
Christ!

78
00:16:32,567 --> 00:16:35,737
Mitchell must have killed him,
when he went out to check the perimeter.

79
00:16:35,737 --> 00:16:38,865
- You're lucky to be here.
- You think White is still alive?

80
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:40,950
- Yes I do.
- What is it?

81
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:43,828
Craig Mitchell, 45 years old,
has no living family...

82
00:16:43,828 --> 00:16:45,413
gave generously to charity.

83
00:16:45,413 --> 00:16:47,081
- Tell me you know more than that.
- Yes...

84
00:16:47,081 --> 00:16:49,834
Our money men went through every
bill in Mitchell's wallet and house.

85
00:16:49,834 --> 00:16:53,129
- How much did he have?
- Less than 100 pounds.

86
00:16:53,129 --> 00:16:55,131
And about the same,
in euros and dollars.

87
00:16:55,131 --> 00:16:56,799
Excuse me! Excuse me, ma'am.

88
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:59,802
We did a complete forensic analysis
of every note and its traceable history.

89
00:16:59,802 --> 00:17:01,763
I'm not in the mood.

90
00:17:03,431 --> 00:17:05,350
After you.

91
00:17:05,642 --> 00:17:08,436
This particular note from Mitchell's
wallet might be of interest.

92
00:17:08,436 --> 00:17:11,814
We introduced tagged bills into
Le Chiffre's money laundering operation...

93
00:17:11,814 --> 00:17:13,983
by intercepting illegal payoffs.

94
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:17,111
We traced money through several of
his bank accounts around the world.

95
00:17:17,111 --> 00:17:18,446
That's pretty thin.

96
00:17:18,446 --> 00:17:19,822
At the rate
money changes hands...

97
00:17:19,822 --> 00:17:22,242
you could probably find a tenner
in my robe with a tag.

98
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:25,912
That's true Ma'am, a single bill could be a
coincidence, but what about a whole stack?

99
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:28,373
These bills from
the same series as Mitchell's...

100
00:17:28,373 --> 00:17:31,751
were just scanned at a bank
in Port au Prince, Haiti.

101
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:34,963
Deposited into the account
of a Mr Slate.

102
00:17:34,963 --> 00:17:36,339
Impress me.

103
00:17:36,339 --> 00:17:40,260
We have a Mr Edmund Slate, returning to
Port au Prince from Heathrow this morning.

104
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,555
His entry documents have
him staying at Hotel Dessalines.

105
00:17:43,555 --> 00:17:46,349
He's in room 325.

106
00:17:55,567 --> 00:17:56,693
Thank you.

107
00:17:56,693 --> 00:17:58,736
You're welcome.

108
00:20:06,656 --> 00:20:09,033
Do you have any messages for 325?

109
00:20:10,702 --> 00:20:14,998
Oh, no sir, the only message is about
the briefcase that was delivered earlier.

110
00:20:14,998 --> 00:20:16,666
Did you want us
to continue holding it?

111
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:18,877
- No, I'll take that now.
- Yes, sir.

112
00:20:21,671 --> 00:20:23,673
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

113
00:20:32,015 --> 00:20:33,391
Get in.

114
00:20:33,892 --> 00:20:36,311
- What?
- Get in!

115
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:39,355
Fine.

116
00:20:42,692 --> 00:20:44,277
You're late.

117
00:20:44,277 --> 00:20:45,695
Oh...
I got pulled into a meeting.

118
00:20:45,987 --> 00:20:49,449
- Who with?
- A friend of Mr. Whites.

119
00:20:50,825 --> 00:20:52,577
I don't think I know him.

120
00:20:56,581 --> 00:20:57,707
It's funny.

121
00:20:57,707 --> 00:20:59,876
You don't look at all
like I expected.

122
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:01,336
Really?

123
00:21:01,336 --> 00:21:02,378
What were you expecting?

124
00:21:02,378 --> 00:21:05,006
I didn't think geologists
looked so...

125
00:21:05,006 --> 00:21:07,050
So?

126
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:11,346
Friend of yours?

127
00:21:11,387 --> 00:21:13,097
I don't have any friends.

128
00:21:20,605 --> 00:21:22,523
Get outta the way, move it!

129
00:21:35,036 --> 00:21:36,913
We didn't settle on a price.

130
00:21:36,913 --> 00:21:39,082
Make me an offer.

131
00:21:39,707 --> 00:21:43,044
Okay, we can work out later,
over drinks.

132
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:47,173
Dominic,
didn't give you any trouble, did he?

133
00:21:47,173 --> 00:21:48,508
No.

134
00:21:52,929 --> 00:21:54,847
What the hell is this?

135
00:21:55,014 --> 00:21:57,600
I think someone wants to kill you.

136
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,025
That wasn't very nice.

137
00:22:08,862 --> 00:22:10,655
You were supposed to shoot her.

138
00:22:10,655 --> 00:22:12,282
Well, I missed.

139
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:25,295
- I guess he didn't like that.
- Get Bond.

140
00:22:25,336 --> 00:22:27,130
Where is he now?

141
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:30,133
Approaching the docks.
Kings Key.

142
00:22:32,802 --> 00:22:34,470
- Tanner?
- I've got Bond.

143
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:37,557
<i>- Ask him about Slate.
- She wants to know about Slate.</i>

144
00:22:37,557 --> 00:22:40,643
- Tell her Slate was a dead end.
- Slate was a dead end.

145
00:22:40,643 --> 00:22:43,646
Damn-it!...
He must have killed him.

146
00:22:55,116 --> 00:22:58,995
Yes mommy, it's awful hot here.

147
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:18,681
- Wough... wough... whough... wough.
- Touch me and I'll break your wrist.

148
00:23:29,859 --> 00:23:31,694
Camille?

149
00:23:32,362 --> 00:23:34,614
How nice to see you.

150
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:36,699
Alive you mean?

151
00:23:37,992 --> 00:23:41,287
I knew we shouldn't have
slept together.

152
00:23:41,287 --> 00:23:43,706
I think I'm starting to like you.

153
00:23:43,706 --> 00:23:46,334
So you did just try
to have me killed?

154
00:23:47,335 --> 00:23:51,881
And that made me very sad
thinking I would never see you again.

155
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,842
- But... here you are.
- Damn-it, Dominic!

156
00:23:54,842 --> 00:23:57,262
I was trying to help you!

157
00:23:59,556 --> 00:24:02,225
I was trying to uncover a leak.

158
00:24:02,267 --> 00:24:05,186
And you...
you send someone to kill me?

159
00:24:05,186 --> 00:24:07,855
Please, don't talk to me
like I'm stupid!

160
00:24:09,274 --> 00:24:11,526
It's unattractive.

161
00:24:13,194 --> 00:24:16,197
Come, I wanna show you something.

162
00:24:18,032 --> 00:24:19,534
Come.

163
00:24:20,118 --> 00:24:22,996
There is nothing that makes me
more uncomfortable, than...

164
00:24:22,996 --> 00:24:25,331
friends talking behind my back.

165
00:24:25,331 --> 00:24:27,584
It feels like...

166
00:24:27,584 --> 00:24:30,211
ants under my skin.

167
00:24:30,545 --> 00:24:32,589
It's been that way forever...

168
00:24:32,797 --> 00:24:35,717
I remember when I was 15.

169
00:24:35,717 --> 00:24:38,970
I had a crush on one of my
mother's piano students.

170
00:24:40,013 --> 00:24:41,389
Somehow...

171
00:24:41,389 --> 00:24:45,310
I overheard her saying very
nasty things about me.

172
00:24:45,977 --> 00:24:48,438
I got so angry...

173
00:24:48,646 --> 00:24:51,482
I took a knife...

174
00:24:53,902 --> 00:24:56,196
Is that him?

175
00:24:56,321 --> 00:24:59,908
I don't...
We only spoke on the phone.

176
00:25:01,326 --> 00:25:05,538
It's such a shame, because he's one
of my best geologists.

177
00:25:05,705 --> 00:25:09,083
He said you asked
to buy information.

178
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:13,171
No, he called me and offered
to sell information.

179
00:25:14,464 --> 00:25:17,884
Why would I come back here
if I was lying?

180
00:25:18,635 --> 00:25:20,094
Because you love me.

181
00:25:20,094 --> 00:25:22,263
I was doing it for you.

182
00:25:22,513 --> 00:25:25,099
To stop him from betraying you.

183
00:25:25,683 --> 00:25:29,687
You know what burns more...
then all your bullshit?

184
00:25:29,729 --> 00:25:34,150
Is that I always got the feeling
that you were only sleeping with me...

185
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:37,278
to get to General Medrano.

186
00:25:38,196 --> 00:25:39,614
Is that him?

187
00:25:40,323 --> 00:25:43,034
You know how these
deposed dictators are.

188
00:25:43,618 --> 00:25:46,496
Solicitous of their safety.

189
00:25:47,372 --> 00:25:48,998
Stick around.

190
00:25:49,874 --> 00:25:51,918
I'll introduce you.

191
00:25:54,045 --> 00:25:55,880
You see the girl
that just walked in here?

192
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,174
Would you give her that
and tell her to call me.

193
00:26:17,694 --> 00:26:22,574
<i>You have reached Universal Exports,
all our offices are currently closed...</i>

194
00:26:28,997 --> 00:26:31,916
And you can do all this for me?

195
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:35,962
Well look at,
what we did to this country.

196
00:26:36,004 --> 00:26:38,256
The Haitians elect a priest
who decides...

197
00:26:38,256 --> 00:26:41,759
to raise the minimum wage
from 38 cents to one dollar a day.

198
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:42,760
Oh...

199
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:46,014
It's not a lot, but it's enough
to upset the corporations...

200
00:26:46,014 --> 00:26:49,225
who were here making T-hirts
and running shoes.

201
00:26:49,225 --> 00:26:53,479
So they called us
and we facilitated the change.

202
00:26:53,605 --> 00:26:59,235
The difference is my country is not some
fly speck in the middle of the Caribbean.

203
00:26:59,235 --> 00:27:02,572
Plus we've already begun
destabilizing the government.

204
00:27:02,572 --> 00:27:04,949
We'll supply the private security.

205
00:27:04,949 --> 00:27:07,368
We'll pay off the right officials...

206
00:27:07,368 --> 00:27:11,623
And we have 26 countries ready to
officially recognize your...

207
00:27:11,623 --> 00:27:14,876
new Bolivian government.

208
00:27:14,918 --> 00:27:17,545
You want your country back.

209
00:27:17,545 --> 00:27:21,633
My organization can give it
to you within... two weeks.

210
00:27:22,884 --> 00:27:24,928
You've been busy.

211
00:27:24,928 --> 00:27:28,348
And in return...
you want what?

212
00:27:28,348 --> 00:27:29,933
A desert.

213
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:40,109
- This part.
- This land is worthless.

214
00:27:40,109 --> 00:27:43,446
Ahh...
So you're getting a great deal?

215
00:27:43,446 --> 00:27:45,532
You won't find oil there.

216
00:27:45,532 --> 00:27:47,784
Everyone has tried.

217
00:27:47,825 --> 00:27:49,285
Maybe.

218
00:27:49,285 --> 00:27:51,120
Maybe not.

219
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,958
But we own...
whatever we find.

220
00:27:56,459 --> 00:27:58,294
Good.

221
00:28:00,755 --> 00:28:01,798
Huh...

222
00:28:01,798 --> 00:28:07,011
- Did you know, Ernesto Montes?
- A very powerful man in his day.

223
00:28:07,011 --> 00:28:10,473
- He had a beautiful Russian wife.
- I know he did...

224
00:28:10,473 --> 00:28:12,725
- A dancer...
- Mm'hm.

225
00:28:12,767 --> 00:28:15,645
And his daughter works for me...

226
00:28:15,728 --> 00:28:17,647
or... did.

227
00:28:17,647 --> 00:28:19,607
She's lovely.

228
00:28:19,607 --> 00:28:22,026
But I don't see the resemblance.

229
00:28:22,026 --> 00:28:26,906
Why don't you consider her
something to sweeten the deal?

230
00:28:28,658 --> 00:28:32,871
Just promise me to drop her over
the side when you're done.

231
00:28:34,122 --> 00:28:37,458
Camille...
General Medrano.

232
00:28:37,542 --> 00:28:43,548
- General... Mucho gusto. (Great pleasure)
- Mucho gusto, señorita.

233
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:55,435
Be careful what you wish for,
my dear.

234
00:29:03,818 --> 00:29:05,695
Have fun you too.

235
00:30:15,306 --> 00:30:18,184
Don't let 'em get away!
Don't let 'em get away!

236
00:30:24,691 --> 00:30:26,067
What the hell are you doing?

237
00:30:26,067 --> 00:30:28,570
- You're welcome!
- You idiot, take me back.

238
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:30,738
You know, maybe I'll do that later.

239
00:30:34,075 --> 00:30:36,160
You're not one of Greene's?

240
00:30:37,328 --> 00:30:38,997
Dominic Greene?

241
00:30:42,709 --> 00:30:44,377
Get down!

242
00:31:09,277 --> 00:31:11,196
- Give me the wheel!
- Navigate!

243
00:31:17,493 --> 00:31:18,912
Left!

244
00:31:29,756 --> 00:31:32,550
- What're you doing?
- Hold on!

245
00:31:48,858 --> 00:31:50,693
Get down!

246
00:33:09,939 --> 00:33:11,357
- Excuse me.
- Take her.

247
00:33:11,357 --> 00:33:12,358
Thank you.

248
00:33:12,358 --> 00:33:14,110
She's seasick.

249
00:33:45,558 --> 00:33:48,728
It's Bond...
Connect Bond!

250
00:33:49,896 --> 00:33:50,939
Yes?

251
00:33:50,939 --> 00:33:55,109
Name check: Dominic Greene.
G- R- double E-N-E.

252
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:56,986
We'll need more than this.

253
00:33:56,986 --> 00:33:59,781
Might need a little more than that,
there're a lot of Dominic Greenes'.

254
00:33:59,781 --> 00:34:01,908
Do you have a social security
or passport number?

255
00:34:01,908 --> 00:34:02,825
No.

256
00:34:04,202 --> 00:34:05,954
Anything?

257
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:08,790
Do you have anything?

258
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:10,917
- Will you put her on, please.
- I am on, Bond.

259
00:34:10,917 --> 00:34:12,335
What happened to Slate?

260
00:34:12,335 --> 00:34:14,879
I'm not dwelling on the past,
I don't think you should either.

261
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:16,506
You killed him?

262
00:34:16,506 --> 00:34:19,133
NOR just hit: Dominic Greene,
CEO of Greene Planet.

263
00:34:19,133 --> 00:34:21,427
It's... a utility company...

264
00:34:21,427 --> 00:34:23,846
but Greene's been doing a lot of
philanthropic work...

265
00:34:23,846 --> 00:34:26,182
buying up large tracts of land
for ecological preserves.

266
00:34:26,182 --> 00:34:28,268
<i>You should be getting
his picture now.</i>

267
00:34:29,352 --> 00:34:30,895
Yeah, that's him.

268
00:34:31,229 --> 00:34:33,815
I'm afraid there's a firewall
around his other corporate holdings...

269
00:34:33,815 --> 00:34:35,483
so, we have no other information.

270
00:34:35,483 --> 00:34:37,277
Get me the Americans.

271
00:34:37,277 --> 00:34:38,820
<i>Connect.</i>

272
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:39,863
<i>Go ahead.</i>

273
00:34:39,863 --> 00:34:42,490
Interest in Dominic Greene,
Greene Planet.

274
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:44,576
<i>Transferring you now...</i>

275
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,996
<i>Hold for Gregory Beam, please.</i>

276
00:34:49,289 --> 00:34:52,292
<i>Thank you... oh, hi,
this is Gregory Beam, ma'am.</i>

277
00:34:52,292 --> 00:34:54,002
Hello, Mr. Beam.

278
00:34:54,002 --> 00:34:57,338
<i>Huh... so sorry to keep you waiting.
We have no interest in Mr. Greene.</i>

279
00:34:57,338 --> 00:35:00,133
<i>- Thank you, Mr. Beam.
- Connection terminated.</i>

280
00:35:00,133 --> 00:35:01,843
He's a person of extreme interest.

281
00:35:01,843 --> 00:35:03,887
- But he just said that...
- Tanner...

282
00:35:03,887 --> 00:35:07,140
I asked about the man and she transferred
me to the section chief of South America.

283
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,893
How would she know to do that
if they weren't tracking him?

284
00:35:14,564 --> 00:35:17,150
<i>Bond, we have your location
as approaching an airfield.</i>

285
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,943
<i>Is Greene on the move?</i>

286
00:35:18,985 --> 00:35:22,614
Yeah, I've got a tail number
Golf Zero Charlie Sierra Charlie.

287
00:35:22,614 --> 00:35:24,574
<i>It'll get you it's destination.</i>

288
00:35:27,493 --> 00:35:32,081
<i>It's a... private charter, going to
Bregenz Austria, leaving immediately.</i>

289
00:35:32,498 --> 00:35:35,752
<i>Tanner,
authorize a Charter for 007.</i>

290
00:35:36,461 --> 00:35:41,341
And Bond, if you could avoid killing every
possible lead, it would be deeply appreciated.

291
00:35:41,341 --> 00:35:45,929
<i>- Yes, ma'am... I'll do my best.
- Connection terminated</i>

292
00:35:45,929 --> 00:35:47,847
I've heard that before.

293
00:35:50,391 --> 00:35:51,768
- Hello.
- Hi.

294
00:35:51,768 --> 00:35:53,686
Ah, welcome aboard.

295
00:35:54,479 --> 00:35:56,064
Bon jour... Ca va? (Okay?)

296
00:35:56,064 --> 00:35:58,816
- Ca va, ca va. (Okay, okay.)
- Come, have a seat.

297
00:36:15,875 --> 00:36:17,877
Jeez.

298
00:36:17,877 --> 00:36:19,629
Sorry.

299
00:36:22,632 --> 00:36:24,717
How much longer?

300
00:36:27,011 --> 00:36:29,305
So do we have an understanding?

301
00:36:30,139 --> 00:36:31,182
Well, yeah...

302
00:36:31,182 --> 00:36:35,311
We do nothing to stop a coup
in Bolivia and in exchange, the huh...

303
00:36:35,311 --> 00:36:39,315
new government gives America
the lease to any oil found.

304
00:36:39,774 --> 00:36:42,110
If it's oil you want.

305
00:36:42,986 --> 00:36:45,905
You didn't find diamonds, did ya?

306
00:36:51,035 --> 00:36:52,996
Ah, drilling underground...

307
00:36:52,996 --> 00:36:55,248
you kept off everyone's radar
for a very long time but...

308
00:36:55,248 --> 00:36:59,419
you can't buy that much piping
without somebody getting curious.

309
00:37:00,378 --> 00:37:02,714
We'll have to verify the find.

310
00:37:02,714 --> 00:37:08,094
I'm not really admitting there is one.
You are getting this for free.

311
00:37:08,094 --> 00:37:11,431
Venezuela, Brazil now Bolivia.

312
00:37:11,431 --> 00:37:15,935
With you tied up in the Middle East,
South America is falling like dominoes.

313
00:37:17,395 --> 00:37:22,025
You don't need another Marxist giving
national resources to people, do you?

314
00:37:22,025 --> 00:37:23,860
No, we can hardly be expected...

315
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:26,279
to do something about a coup
we know nothing about.

316
00:37:29,866 --> 00:37:32,619
I think, I have a... pest

317
00:37:37,957 --> 00:37:40,460
You have any idea who that is?

318
00:37:51,012 --> 00:37:52,764
Sorry.

319
00:37:54,349 --> 00:37:57,352
It's James Bond,
British Secret Service.

320
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,397
I don't know how
I could've missed that.

321
00:38:02,899 --> 00:38:05,944
I will need for you
to get rid of him for me.

322
00:38:05,944 --> 00:38:08,655
Yeah...
That's not gonna be a problem.

323
00:38:24,921 --> 00:38:27,715
You know who Greene is, and you
wanna put us in bed with him.

324
00:38:27,715 --> 00:38:29,008
You are kidding right?

325
00:38:29,008 --> 00:38:32,345
Yeah, you're right.
We should just deal with nice people.

326
00:38:32,345 --> 00:38:35,348
I need to know
you're on the team, Felix.

327
00:38:35,348 --> 00:38:38,268
I need to know
you value your career.

328
00:40:11,486 --> 00:40:13,071
- Good to see you again.
- Nice to see you too.

329
00:40:13,112 --> 00:40:14,989
- Have a nice evening.
- Thank you.

330
00:42:22,033 --> 00:42:25,787
<i>- How much more pipeline do we need?
- Should be Ideal maybe...</i>

331
00:42:25,787 --> 00:42:27,664
2000 kilometers.

332
00:42:27,664 --> 00:42:29,624
<i>Are there any objections?</i>

333
00:42:30,375 --> 00:42:34,295
<i>- No... not here.
- No objections.</i>

334
00:42:35,255 --> 00:42:37,882
Transfer the funds from
our Siberian holdings.

335
00:42:38,258 --> 00:42:39,425
<i>Done.</i>

336
00:42:43,471 --> 00:42:45,598
Where do the Americans stand?

337
00:42:45,598 --> 00:42:50,061
The CIA doesn't care about another
dictator as long as they get a free hand.

338
00:42:50,103 --> 00:42:52,856
But when they find out that
they've been duped?

339
00:42:52,897 --> 00:42:54,440
I'm working on that.

340
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:57,902
I'm still not sure that the Tierra project
is the best use for Quantum this time.

341
00:42:57,944 --> 00:43:00,363
<i>Perhaps we should shift
our focus to the Canadians.</i>

342
00:43:00,363 --> 00:43:03,283
<i>This is the world's most
precious resource.</i>

343
00:43:03,283 --> 00:43:06,119
<i>We need to control as
much of it as we can.</i>

344
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:08,746
Bolivia must be top priority.

345
00:43:09,205 --> 00:43:11,332
Can I offer an opinion?

346
00:43:12,375 --> 00:43:16,713
I really think you people should
find a better place to meet.

347
00:43:22,468 --> 00:43:24,429
Where do you think you're going?

348
00:43:45,742 --> 00:43:47,368
Thank you.

349
00:43:57,378 --> 00:44:00,715
It seems Tosca isn't for everyone.

350
00:45:14,497 --> 00:45:16,332
Drop it!

351
00:45:19,502 --> 00:45:21,880
So, who're you working for?

352
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,548
Piss off!

353
00:45:23,548 --> 00:45:27,719
Get rid of anything we brought with us.
We've been compromised.

354
00:45:30,054 --> 00:45:32,515
I asked you,
who you were working for.

355
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,696
- Is he one of ours?
- No.

356
00:45:46,696 --> 00:45:49,157
Then he shouldn't be looking at me.

357
00:45:57,582 --> 00:46:00,001
Get me M.

358
00:46:01,586 --> 00:46:05,381
- Fräulein...
- Heinz... connect call.

359
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:08,009
We've ID'd the pictures.

360
00:46:08,009 --> 00:46:09,677
Show me.

361
00:46:09,677 --> 00:46:14,265
Gregor Karakov, former minister, now
owns most of the mines in Siberia.

362
00:46:14,432 --> 00:46:18,269
Moeshi Saroff, former Mossad,
now Telecomm giant...

363
00:46:18,269 --> 00:46:20,897
and Guy Haines, special envoy
to the prime minister.

364
00:46:20,939 --> 00:46:23,399
- Get Bond.
- There's something else.

365
00:46:23,399 --> 00:46:27,737
It appears Bond shot Haines's
bodyguard and threw him off a roof.

366
00:46:32,283 --> 00:46:34,536
<i>- Where are you?
- Did you get my pictures?</i>

367
00:46:34,536 --> 00:46:37,080
<i>Abridge this conversation,
can you link these people?</i>

368
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:39,499
<i>- I hear stress in your voice.
- I need you to come in and debrief.</i>

369
00:46:39,499 --> 00:46:42,752
- I don't have time.
- Bond, you killed a man in Bregenz.

370
00:46:42,752 --> 00:46:44,212
I did my best not to.

371
00:46:44,212 --> 00:46:46,172
You shot him at point blank
and threw him off a roof.

372
00:46:46,172 --> 00:46:48,216
I'd hardly call that
"showing restraint".

373
00:46:48,258 --> 00:46:50,760
Especially since he was
a member of special branch.

374
00:46:53,888 --> 00:46:55,431
So, who was he guarding?

375
00:46:55,431 --> 00:46:58,268
Bond, you're missing the fact that you
killed a member of the special branch.

376
00:46:58,268 --> 00:47:01,271
- I want you to come in.
- And I would...

377
00:47:01,271 --> 00:47:03,857
but right now I need to find
the one who tried to kill you.

378
00:47:03,857 --> 00:47:06,818
<i>- Go back to sleep.
- Connection terminated</i>

379
00:47:06,818 --> 00:47:09,988
Restrict Bond's movements.
Cancel his cards.

380
00:47:09,988 --> 00:47:12,282
Put an alert on his passports.
All of them...

381
00:47:12,282 --> 00:47:14,617
and I want to know everything
we don't know about Haines.

382
00:47:14,617 --> 00:47:16,619
- Yes, ma'am.
- And Tanner...

383
00:47:16,661 --> 00:47:18,830
be careful who you trust with this.

384
00:47:18,872 --> 00:47:21,416
Hopefully you're a better
judge of character than I am.

385
00:47:22,417 --> 00:47:25,378
You want to follow your friends
to La Paz, Bolivia?

386
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:26,963
Please.

387
00:47:27,088 --> 00:47:28,882
(Abgelehnt Rejected)

388
00:47:28,882 --> 00:47:30,550
Oh, I'm sorry sir,
but this one doesn't work.

389
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:32,719
Do you have another card?

390
00:47:32,844 --> 00:47:34,470
No.

391
00:47:39,601 --> 00:47:41,477
Could you do me a favor.

392
00:47:41,477 --> 00:47:43,563
You're gonna get a phone call
in a minute.

393
00:47:43,563 --> 00:47:46,482
Would you mind telling them
I'm headed for Cairo?

394
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,234
I'll be happy to.

395
00:47:48,234 --> 00:47:49,819
Thank you.

396
00:47:54,741 --> 00:47:56,784
Ocean Sky, guten abend.
(good evening)

397
00:48:29,067 --> 00:48:31,027
Mathis.

398
00:48:31,027 --> 00:48:32,695
What do you want?

399
00:48:33,112 --> 00:48:35,198
Come to apologize?

400
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:41,955
You know Mathis...
I think retirement suits you.

401
00:48:42,705 --> 00:48:44,624
None for him.

402
00:48:44,624 --> 00:48:47,627
Sorry...
he is in a bad mood today.

403
00:49:11,484 --> 00:49:14,070
I need a passport
and matching credit cards.

404
00:49:14,237 --> 00:49:16,072
Has MI-6 run out of plastic?

405
00:49:18,157 --> 00:49:20,535
Well oddly right now you're the
only person I think I should trust.

406
00:49:20,535 --> 00:49:22,245
That is odd.

407
00:49:22,245 --> 00:49:25,582
But I guess, when one's
young it seems very easy...

408
00:49:25,582 --> 00:49:27,584
to distinguish between
right and wrong.

409
00:49:27,584 --> 00:49:29,711
But as one gets older...

410
00:49:29,711 --> 00:49:31,254
it becomes more difficult.

411
00:49:31,254 --> 00:49:34,340
The villains and the heros
get all mixed up.

412
00:49:35,174 --> 00:49:38,219
I was sorry to hear about Vesper.

413
00:49:38,219 --> 00:49:40,972
- I think she loved you.
- Hm'hm...

414
00:49:40,972 --> 00:49:43,975
right up until the
moment she betrayed me.

415
00:49:43,975 --> 00:49:45,852
She died for you.

416
00:49:47,353 --> 00:49:50,106
Why did you really want to see me?

417
00:49:52,108 --> 00:49:54,360
I need some information.

418
00:49:56,362 --> 00:49:58,031
Ahh...

419
00:49:58,031 --> 00:50:00,033
you have some hard friends.

420
00:50:00,241 --> 00:50:03,536
This man is some kind of
facilitator, fingers in many pies...

421
00:50:03,536 --> 00:50:05,455
but that don't leave any prints.

422
00:50:05,872 --> 00:50:07,874
These men were together?

423
00:50:07,874 --> 00:50:09,375
They're buying up oil pipeline.

424
00:50:09,375 --> 00:50:11,836
Something called
the "Tierra Project", you know it?

425
00:50:11,836 --> 00:50:15,590
Destroy these! That's the guy, Haines.
You don't know him?

426
00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:17,800
- Should I?
- I suppose not.

427
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:20,637
You haven't been keeping
secrets as long as I have.

428
00:50:20,637 --> 00:50:22,722
He keeps a very low profile...

429
00:50:22,722 --> 00:50:26,559
but is one of the
Prime Ministers' closest advisers.

430
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:29,646
And they say that you're judged
by the strength of your enemies...

431
00:50:30,563 --> 00:50:32,649
You know anything about Bolivia?

432
00:50:32,649 --> 00:50:35,860
I was stationed
in South America for 7 years.

433
00:50:36,277 --> 00:50:37,529
You probably still have
some contacts there?

434
00:50:37,529 --> 00:50:39,280
A few.

435
00:50:39,322 --> 00:50:41,074
What do you want to know?

436
00:50:42,116 --> 00:50:43,993
Come with me.

437
00:51:14,941 --> 00:51:16,401
You can't sleep?

438
00:51:16,693 --> 00:51:18,653
May I fix you a drink, sir?

439
00:51:18,653 --> 00:51:20,738
What're you drinking?

440
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:23,324
I don't know,
what am I drinking?

441
00:51:23,324 --> 00:51:27,203
3 measures of Gordon's Gin,
1 of Vodka, 1/2 a measure of Kina O...

442
00:51:27,203 --> 00:51:30,248
- Kina Ole...
- Kina Ole, which is not Vermouth.

443
00:51:30,248 --> 00:51:32,375
Shaken well until it's ice cold...

444
00:51:32,375 --> 00:51:35,003
then served with a large
thin slice of lemon peel.

445
00:51:35,712 --> 00:51:37,088
Six of them.

446
00:51:37,463 --> 00:51:41,009
- That's impressive.
- They're good, you should have one.

447
00:51:41,134 --> 00:51:44,429
Nah... it would just keep me awake.

448
00:51:48,349 --> 00:51:51,019
So, what's keeping you awake?

449
00:51:53,354 --> 00:51:55,815
I was wondering
why you came with me.

450
00:51:57,609 --> 00:52:00,945
It takes something
to admit you were wrong.

451
00:52:04,199 --> 00:52:05,783
You want a sleeping pill?

452
00:52:05,867 --> 00:52:08,828
- No.
- Pain pill?

453
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:10,830
I have pills for everything.

454
00:52:10,955 --> 00:52:13,458
Some make you taller.

455
00:52:14,083 --> 00:52:16,252
Some make you forget.

456
00:52:19,505 --> 00:52:21,883
I'm gonna try
to get some sleep.

457
00:52:21,883 --> 00:52:23,343
Good idea.

458
00:52:38,733 --> 00:52:39,734
Thank you.

459
00:52:39,734 --> 00:52:43,112
One moment, Mr. Bond, my name is Fields,
I'm from the consulate.

460
00:52:43,112 --> 00:52:45,615
Well, of course you are,
what'd you do at the consulate, Fields?

461
00:52:45,615 --> 00:52:48,243
That's not what's important.
My orders are to turn you around...

462
00:52:48,284 --> 00:52:50,578
and put you on the first plane
back to London.

463
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:53,081
Do those orders
include my friend Mathis?

464
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:55,208
I'm sorry, I don't know who you are.

465
00:52:55,542 --> 00:52:58,169
You see that? Gone such a short
time and already forgotten.

466
00:52:58,836 --> 00:53:00,547
Ahh, you're just saying that
to hurt me.

467
00:53:00,672 --> 00:53:03,883
Mr Bond, these orders come from
the highest possible authority.

468
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:08,096
Tomorrow morning.

469
00:53:08,096 --> 00:53:09,430
Well then, we have all night.

470
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:11,391
If you try to flee,
I will arrest you...

471
00:53:11,391 --> 00:53:14,269
drop you off in jail and take you
to the plane in chains. Understand?

472
00:53:14,269 --> 00:53:16,187
Perfectly, after you.

473
00:53:17,355 --> 00:53:19,107
I think she has handcuffs.

474
00:53:19,148 --> 00:53:20,275
I certainly hope so.

475
00:53:27,782 --> 00:53:31,035
He blames the water shortage
on global warming.

476
00:53:37,584 --> 00:53:41,087
The colonel,
who heads the national police.

477
00:53:58,479 --> 00:54:00,273
Carlos, momentito.

478
00:54:05,361 --> 00:54:08,072
- We have a reservation.
- One moment.

479
00:54:08,072 --> 00:54:09,199
- Okay.
- I'll have to verify it.

480
00:54:09,199 --> 00:54:10,325
Very well, thank you.

481
00:54:10,325 --> 00:54:12,827
- Your name?
- Miss Fields.

482
00:54:14,287 --> 00:54:15,955
Wait...

483
00:54:17,457 --> 00:54:18,625
You're going nowhere.

484
00:54:18,625 --> 00:54:20,335
So, shoot me,
I'd rather stay at a morgue.

485
00:54:20,376 --> 00:54:22,712
We are teachers on sabbatical,
it fits our cover.

486
00:54:23,546 --> 00:54:24,797
No, it doesn't... get in.

487
00:54:25,298 --> 00:54:26,466
Get in!

488
00:54:41,356 --> 00:54:42,398
Ola... (Hello...)

489
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:53,993
Follow me please.

490
00:55:01,417 --> 00:55:03,336
May I show you your room, Señor?

491
00:55:03,378 --> 00:55:05,421
- No, it's fine, thank you.
- Gracias.

492
00:55:22,522 --> 00:55:26,901
I can't find the, um...
the stationery.

493
00:55:27,652 --> 00:55:29,195
Come and help me look.

494
00:55:44,419 --> 00:55:45,879
We've been invited to a party.

495
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:48,172
I didn't know we had any friends here.

496
00:55:49,757 --> 00:55:51,092
Green Planet.

497
00:55:52,385 --> 00:55:53,970
You're not coming?

498
00:55:54,012 --> 00:55:56,264
I'm having a drink with my friend,
the Colonel.

499
00:55:56,264 --> 00:55:58,057
I'll see you there later.

500
00:56:02,937 --> 00:56:05,607
Do you know
how angry I am at myself?

501
00:56:06,691 --> 00:56:08,359
I can't imagine.

502
00:56:11,279 --> 00:56:13,114
You must be furious.

503
00:56:19,495 --> 00:56:21,122
Do you wanna go to a party?

504
00:56:22,624 --> 00:56:23,833
Party?

505
00:56:24,709 --> 00:56:26,669
But I have nothing to wear.

506
00:56:27,212 --> 00:56:28,796
We'll fix that.

507
00:56:47,273 --> 00:56:50,652
It might be useful
to know your real name.

508
00:56:50,902 --> 00:56:52,237
Fields.

509
00:56:54,072 --> 00:56:55,657
Just Fields.

510
00:56:56,741 --> 00:56:58,409
Fields it is.

511
00:56:58,952 --> 00:57:03,081
We are in a spiral
of environmental decline.

512
00:57:03,998 --> 00:57:05,750
Since 1945...

513
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:12,966
17% of the planet's vegetated surface
has been irreversibly degraded.

514
00:57:13,550 --> 00:57:19,013
The Tierra project is just one small
part of a global network, of equal parts...

515
00:57:19,138 --> 00:57:23,852
that Green Planet has created,
to rejuvenate the world...

516
00:57:23,852 --> 00:57:25,520
on the verge of collapse.

517
00:57:27,063 --> 00:57:31,860
I hope that tonight, you make the
decision to be part of that.

518
00:57:33,027 --> 00:57:34,612
Thank you.

519
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,451
And have fun.

520
00:57:44,205 --> 00:57:46,040
Excellent speech. Congratulations.

521
00:57:46,165 --> 00:57:47,959
Wonderful speech, Dominic.

522
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:49,711
Thank you.

523
00:57:50,545 --> 00:57:52,213
Miss Fields, Mr. Bond...

524
00:57:52,422 --> 00:57:55,133
- my friend Carlos.
- Pleased to meet you.

525
00:57:55,133 --> 00:57:56,175
Ma'am.

526
00:57:56,509 --> 00:57:59,804
Mr. Bond, Mathis has spoken
a great deal about you.

527
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:04,184
I want you to know my entire
police force... is at your disposal.

528
00:58:04,184 --> 00:58:05,518
Well, that could be very useful.

529
00:58:05,602 --> 00:58:07,604
You know, there are people
in this country...

530
00:58:07,604 --> 00:58:10,148
spending half their paycheck
just to get clean water.

531
00:58:10,315 --> 00:58:11,691
What do you think of that?

532
00:58:11,816 --> 00:58:14,027
The Bolivian government
is the problem.

533
00:58:14,027 --> 00:58:16,613
They cut down the trees,
then act surprised...

534
00:58:16,613 --> 00:58:19,407
when the water and the soil,
wash out to sea.

535
00:58:19,532 --> 00:58:20,950
I couldn't agree more.

536
00:58:20,992 --> 00:58:22,869
I hope this figure
is to your liking.

537
00:58:22,869 --> 00:58:25,121
Cherie, you shouldn't tease.

538
00:58:25,538 --> 00:58:29,834
Why don't you tell them about all the
land you bought up outside near the sea?

539
00:58:29,876 --> 00:58:32,337
It's been a pleasure.
Would you excuse me?

540
00:58:33,504 --> 00:58:36,758
Somehow the logging rights went
to a Multinational Corporation...

541
00:58:36,758 --> 00:58:38,468
that cut down the forests.

542
00:58:38,635 --> 00:58:43,181
But only after our last government
sold the land to Green Planet.

543
00:58:43,932 --> 00:58:45,683
What was that?

544
00:58:45,683 --> 00:58:48,520
- Oh, have I got my facts crossed?
- Yes, I think you did.

545
00:58:49,270 --> 00:58:51,147
Will you excuse us?

546
00:58:52,398 --> 00:58:54,442
What a wonderful night, Señor.

547
00:58:57,237 --> 00:59:00,198
You just cost me quite a bit
of money darling.

548
00:59:00,198 --> 00:59:02,909
You can't put a price
on integrity.

549
00:59:03,243 --> 00:59:04,827
I can try.

550
00:59:11,834 --> 00:59:15,588
Tell me you didn't drop by tonight
just to piss on my parade.

551
00:59:15,630 --> 00:59:19,092
Why are you still after this
general's head, for your mantel?

552
00:59:19,342 --> 00:59:21,177
A little of both.

553
00:59:21,719 --> 00:59:27,100
Tell me where Medrano is, and maybe
you won't lose any more investors.

554
00:59:29,936 --> 00:59:33,690
You are really breaking my heart
choosing an insect like that over me.

555
00:59:35,608 --> 00:59:37,277
You're going to throw me over?

556
00:59:37,443 --> 00:59:40,613
Well, you've been drinking...
maybe you slipped?

557
00:59:41,531 --> 00:59:43,700
Oh... just think
how much you'd miss me.

558
00:59:48,872 --> 00:59:50,415
Good evening.

559
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:52,166
There you are.

560
00:59:54,210 --> 00:59:55,461
Would you excuse me?

561
00:59:56,254 --> 00:59:58,006
Mr. Bond.

562
00:59:58,673 --> 01:00:00,550
What a pleasure.

563
01:00:02,427 --> 01:00:05,180
Careful with this one,
she won't go to bed with you...

564
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:07,974
unless you give her something
she really wants.

565
01:00:07,974 --> 01:00:12,812
That's a shame, because she's really quite
stunning once you... get her on her back.

566
01:00:12,812 --> 01:00:15,773
Yeah, I wish I could say that
the feeling was mutual.

567
01:00:15,773 --> 01:00:17,442
I'm sorry Mr. Greene,
but we have to go.

568
01:00:17,442 --> 01:00:19,402
Please,
my friends call me Dominic.

569
01:00:19,402 --> 01:00:21,487
I'm sure they do.

570
01:00:22,322 --> 01:00:25,658
How much do you know about Bond,
Camille, because he's rather...

571
01:00:25,658 --> 01:00:29,662
a tragic case, his MI-6 says
that he's difficult to control.

572
01:00:29,662 --> 01:00:34,959
Nice way of saying that everything
he touches seems to wither and die.

573
01:00:34,959 --> 01:00:36,252
Shall we?

574
01:00:36,252 --> 01:00:38,755
It doesn't bode well for you,
I'm afraid.

575
01:00:38,755 --> 01:00:41,132
You two do make
a charming couple, though.

576
01:00:41,132 --> 01:00:44,010
You're both...
what's the expression?

577
01:00:44,010 --> 01:00:46,304
Damaged goods.

578
01:00:49,057 --> 01:00:50,934
Oh my Gosh!

579
01:00:51,559 --> 01:00:53,436
I'm so sorry.

580
01:00:56,648 --> 01:00:59,108
Come on, lighten up.
You're cramping my style.

581
01:01:00,443 --> 01:01:04,614
So it's British intelligence now?
What the hell they want from me?

582
01:01:04,614 --> 01:01:06,991
You're gonna show me
Dominic Greene's Tierra Project.

583
01:01:06,991 --> 01:01:09,410
- Are you up to it?
- Do I have choice?

584
01:01:09,410 --> 01:01:10,828
Do you want one?

585
01:01:11,287 --> 01:01:13,957
There's something horribly
efficient about you.

586
01:01:13,957 --> 01:01:15,833
What a compliment.

587
01:01:29,848 --> 01:01:33,184
What's the bet that Dominic Greene
has friends in the police force?

588
01:01:44,487 --> 01:01:46,114
Stay here.

589
01:01:48,491 --> 01:01:50,326
Buenas Noches. (Good Evening)

590
01:02:06,926 --> 01:02:09,429
<i>Now why would you
want me to do that?</i>

591
01:02:41,753 --> 01:02:43,421
Mathis.

592
01:02:44,881 --> 01:02:47,800
There's a hospital
on the other side of town.

593
01:02:48,259 --> 01:02:52,388
Please... stay with me.

594
01:02:52,388 --> 01:02:55,016
Stay here, please.

595
01:02:55,016 --> 01:02:56,351
Please.

596
01:02:56,351 --> 01:02:58,061
Come here.

597
01:02:59,354 --> 01:03:01,564
It's alright...
hold on.

598
01:03:01,648 --> 01:03:03,691
Okay.

599
01:03:04,734 --> 01:03:06,653
That's better.

600
01:03:06,653 --> 01:03:08,988
That way doesn't hurt.

601
01:03:11,533 --> 01:03:13,910
Is Mathis your cover name?

602
01:03:14,994 --> 01:03:16,621
Yes.

603
01:03:18,206 --> 01:03:20,375
Not a very good one, is it?

604
01:03:26,130 --> 01:03:29,342
Do we forgive each other?

605
01:03:30,718 --> 01:03:33,513
I shouldn't have left you alone.

606
01:03:35,098 --> 01:03:37,058
Vesper.

607
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:39,978
She did everything for you.

608
01:03:41,521 --> 01:03:43,773
Forgive her.

609
01:03:45,275 --> 01:03:47,527
Forgive yourself.

610
01:04:08,923 --> 01:04:11,301
Is that how you treat your friends?

611
01:04:11,676 --> 01:04:13,720
He wouldn't care.

612
01:04:19,809 --> 01:04:21,477
Let's go.

613
01:04:35,450 --> 01:04:38,328
The Foreign Secretary
is asking to see you.

614
01:04:39,329 --> 01:04:41,080
What don't I know?

615
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:43,666
<i>René Mathis, has been
shot dead in Bolivia.</i>

616
01:04:43,791 --> 01:04:46,377
<i>The police claim it was Bond.</i>

617
01:05:08,483 --> 01:05:09,692
Buenos días. (Good morning)

618
01:05:12,487 --> 01:05:13,696
Buenos días.

619
01:05:20,662 --> 01:05:23,581
- How much did you pay him?
- Well, he wanted you.

620
01:05:23,581 --> 01:05:26,084
But I left him the car
as collateral.

621
01:05:26,084 --> 01:05:28,419
He'll make much more
when he sells us out.

622
01:05:31,798 --> 01:05:34,759
Alright...
let's see if this thing will fly.

623
01:05:50,817 --> 01:05:52,151
Here...

624
01:05:52,151 --> 01:05:55,363
all the information I found said
there was nothing of value there.

625
01:05:55,363 --> 01:05:57,866
But Greene's geologists
had prove that there was.

626
01:06:01,953 --> 01:06:05,373
My sources tell me you're
Bolivian Secret Service...

627
01:06:06,374 --> 01:06:08,418
or used to be.

628
01:06:08,877 --> 01:06:13,214
And you infiltrated Greene's
organization by having sex with him.

629
01:06:13,464 --> 01:06:16,551
- That offends you?
- No, not in the slightest.

630
01:06:16,968 --> 01:06:19,053
So, what's your interest
in Greene?

631
01:06:19,053 --> 01:06:21,973
Well, amongst other things,
he tried to kill a friend of mine.

632
01:06:22,390 --> 01:06:24,392
- A woman?
- Yes...

633
01:06:24,392 --> 01:06:25,894
but it's not what you think.

634
01:06:25,894 --> 01:06:28,688
- Your mother?
- She likes to think so.

635
01:06:32,192 --> 01:06:34,194
What's that... down there?

636
01:06:36,946 --> 01:06:40,700
That's a sink hole...
There are a few around here.

637
01:06:42,035 --> 01:06:45,246
Just for the record,
I wasn't with Greene for a...

638
01:07:51,855 --> 01:07:53,898
I think we lost him.

639
01:08:02,782 --> 01:08:05,285
He's coming fast.

640
01:08:51,331 --> 01:08:53,291
He's right behind you!

641
01:09:35,208 --> 01:09:38,169
Here!
Put that on!

642
01:10:22,172 --> 01:10:24,507
Come on!

643
01:10:44,402 --> 01:10:46,154
Come here!

644
01:11:04,964 --> 01:11:07,300
According to Bolivians
it was a routine stop...

645
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:10,637
and when they discovered Mathis's body,
Bond disarmed and shot them.

646
01:11:10,637 --> 01:11:13,097
Of course there are no witnesses
to prove otherwise.

647
01:11:13,097 --> 01:11:15,808
I need something.
I can't go in there unarmed.

648
01:11:15,850 --> 01:11:17,560
I'm sorry, there's nothing.

649
01:11:20,396 --> 01:11:22,232
Come in.

650
01:11:22,982 --> 01:11:26,152
What's today's excuse?
That Bond is legally blind?

651
01:11:26,152 --> 01:11:27,654
No, Minister.

652
01:11:27,654 --> 01:11:30,448
I don't think I need to tell you
how upset the P.M. is.

653
01:11:30,865 --> 01:11:33,368
With respect, the P.M. has
my direct line.

654
01:11:33,368 --> 01:11:35,828
And he would've used it
if he wanted to speak to you.

655
01:11:37,247 --> 01:11:43,044
I'm sorry M... things have changed...
We've had long discussions with our cousins.

656
01:11:43,044 --> 01:11:45,588
Mr. Greene's interests
and ours now align.

657
01:11:45,588 --> 01:11:47,549
Minister, this man
is a major player...

658
01:11:47,549 --> 01:11:50,343
in one of the most dangerous
and powerful organizations...

659
01:11:50,343 --> 01:11:52,178
We've never even heard of.

660
01:11:52,178 --> 01:11:55,557
Foreign policy cannot be conducted
on the basis of hunches and inuendo.

661
01:11:55,557 --> 01:11:59,853
Then give us time to gather enough evidence
so you can make informed decisions.

662
01:11:59,894 --> 01:12:01,646
Fine.

663
01:12:01,646 --> 01:12:04,566
Say you're right...
say Greene is a villain.

664
01:12:04,566 --> 01:12:08,736
If we refused to do business with villains
we'd have almost no one to trade with.

665
01:12:09,863 --> 01:12:13,366
The world is running out of oil, M...
The Russians aren't playing ball...

666
01:12:13,366 --> 01:12:15,827
the Americans and Chinese are
dividing up what's left.

667
01:12:15,827 --> 01:12:21,332
Right or wrong doesn't come into it.
We're acting out of necessity.

668
01:12:23,543 --> 01:12:29,757
Bond... is running wild.
Who's to say he hasn't been turned?

669
01:12:29,841 --> 01:12:31,843
Pull him in...

670
01:12:32,010 --> 01:12:35,263
or the Americans will put him down.

671
01:12:37,223 --> 01:12:39,434
I think I've found a way out.

672
01:12:39,601 --> 01:12:41,811
You're freezing.

673
01:12:42,228 --> 01:12:43,897
I'm fine.

674
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:02,957
So what is it
that Greene has that you want?

675
01:13:08,129 --> 01:13:12,300
It's not Greene, it's Medrano...
the man you met in Haiti.

676
01:13:13,551 --> 01:13:17,055
My father...
worked for the Military Junta.

677
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:19,557
He was a very cruel man.

678
01:13:20,683 --> 01:13:23,019
But he was my father.

679
01:13:26,523 --> 01:13:31,945
When I was a small child, the opposition
sent General Medrano to our house.

680
01:13:34,781 --> 01:13:40,245
He shot my father... he did things
to my mother and my sister...

681
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:45,583
and then strangled them
while I watched.

682
01:13:46,042 --> 01:13:49,337
I was too young to be any trouble.

683
01:13:50,088 --> 01:13:52,966
So he just smiled at me...

684
01:13:54,551 --> 01:13:57,262
and set the house on fire.

685
01:13:59,597 --> 01:14:02,183
He left his mark.

686
01:14:05,103 --> 01:14:07,063
So, when I pulled you
off the boat...

687
01:14:07,063 --> 01:14:10,191
I waited years for that chance.

688
01:14:10,441 --> 01:14:12,527
I apologize.

689
01:14:13,987 --> 01:14:17,323
Seems, we're both using
Greene to get to somebody.

690
01:14:18,658 --> 01:14:21,369
You lost somebody?

691
01:14:21,411 --> 01:14:23,663
I did, yes.

692
01:14:23,663 --> 01:14:26,374
You catch whoever did it?

693
01:14:26,499 --> 01:14:29,294
No... not yet.

694
01:14:29,752 --> 01:14:32,505
Tell me when you do...

695
01:14:32,672 --> 01:14:35,550
I'd like to know how it feels.

696
01:14:39,888 --> 01:14:42,015
We should go.

697
01:14:42,432 --> 01:14:44,017
You ready?

698
01:15:17,050 --> 01:15:19,469
They've used dynamite.

699
01:15:22,138 --> 01:15:24,682
This used to be a river bed.

700
01:15:41,449 --> 01:15:45,328
Greene isn't after the oil,
he wants the water.

701
01:15:46,246 --> 01:15:47,830
We can't leave it like this.

702
01:15:47,830 --> 01:15:49,499
It's one dam.

703
01:15:49,499 --> 01:15:53,086
He's creating a drought...
And he'll build others.

704
01:17:21,841 --> 01:17:23,885
Excuse me sir...
your wife left a message.

705
01:17:23,885 --> 01:17:26,846
The English woman.
She left it for you this morning.

706
01:17:26,930 --> 01:17:28,890
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

707
01:17:28,890 --> 01:17:30,725
Run!

708
01:17:30,975 --> 01:17:32,602
What is it?

709
01:17:33,895 --> 01:17:35,939
Would you mind waiting down here?

710
01:17:36,189 --> 01:17:38,566
I'll be outside.

711
01:17:57,669 --> 01:17:59,420
So that's what she meant?

712
01:17:59,754 --> 01:18:01,589
I hope you can trust
these men.

713
01:18:01,589 --> 01:18:03,842
Just a moment...
It's Tanner.

714
01:18:04,551 --> 01:18:07,011
Yes?

715
01:18:07,053 --> 01:18:08,513
We've got the girl downstairs...

716
01:18:08,513 --> 01:18:11,015
She says to tell you she's sorry
but this is not her fight.

717
01:18:11,015 --> 01:18:12,475
It isn't... let her go.

718
01:18:12,475 --> 01:18:14,519
She isn't our concern.

719
01:18:15,311 --> 01:18:16,938
Well, I'm disappointed.

720
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:18,940
You are?

721
01:18:18,940 --> 01:18:21,109
How much oil
did the Americans promise you?

722
01:18:21,109 --> 01:18:23,361
- This isn't about oil.
- Well, that's good, there isn't any.

723
01:18:23,361 --> 01:18:25,113
It's about trust.

724
01:18:25,238 --> 01:18:27,323
You said you weren't motivated
by revenge.

725
01:18:27,323 --> 01:18:28,992
I'm motivated by my duty.

726
01:18:28,992 --> 01:18:30,535
No.

727
01:18:30,743 --> 01:18:35,415
I think you're so blinded by inconsolable
rage that you don't care who you hurt.

728
01:18:36,165 --> 01:18:39,794
When you can't tell your friends
from your enemies it's time to go.

729
01:18:47,552 --> 01:18:50,972
You might like to still hold your
theory about there being no oil.

730
01:18:51,097 --> 01:18:53,266
Her lungs are full of it.

731
01:18:54,642 --> 01:18:55,768
It was Greene.

732
01:18:55,768 --> 01:18:57,729
No doubt. But Why?

733
01:18:58,605 --> 01:19:01,649
- It's just misdirection...
- I mean... why her Bond?

734
01:19:01,649 --> 01:19:03,526
She was just supposed
to send you home.

735
01:19:03,526 --> 01:19:07,113
She worked in an office...
collecting reports.

736
01:19:07,572 --> 01:19:10,617
Look how well
your charm works, James.

737
01:19:10,617 --> 01:19:13,661
They'll do anything for you,
won't they?

738
01:19:13,661 --> 01:19:16,247
How many is that now?

739
01:19:16,247 --> 01:19:19,584
You're removed from duty and suspended
pending further investigation.

740
01:19:19,626 --> 01:19:23,213
You'll give whatever weapons you have
to have these men and leave with them now.

741
01:20:10,093 --> 01:20:11,553
Miss Fields showed true bravery.

742
01:20:11,553 --> 01:20:13,805
I want that mentioned
in your report.

743
01:20:13,847 --> 01:20:15,640
Now, you and I
need to see this through.

744
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:17,100
There's nowhere to go.

745
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:19,561
There's a capture
or kill order out on you.

746
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:22,272
Who would have done that?

747
01:20:32,031 --> 01:20:33,658
Ma'am?
Find out where he's going.

748
01:20:33,658 --> 01:20:35,660
- He's on to something.
- Ma'am, the CIA is insisting...

749
01:20:35,660 --> 01:20:38,162
I don't give a shit about the CIA,
or their trumped up evidence.

750
01:20:38,162 --> 01:20:40,582
He is my agent.
And I trust him.

751
01:20:40,582 --> 01:20:42,083
Go on.

752
01:20:53,094 --> 01:20:54,429
Get in.

753
01:20:54,762 --> 01:20:56,014
You're gonna try to shoot me?

754
01:20:56,014 --> 01:20:57,891
I said, get in.

755
01:21:12,614 --> 01:21:15,241
You'll be getting botulism
if you keep drinking that.

756
01:21:15,241 --> 01:21:17,952
It's bottled water.

757
01:21:18,369 --> 01:21:21,039
It probably came from some stream
just around the corner from here...

758
01:21:21,039 --> 01:21:23,541
a bunch of little kids
peein' in it.

759
01:21:24,709 --> 01:21:28,296
- That's why I eat the peppers.
- Well, all I'm sayin' is...

760
01:21:28,296 --> 01:21:31,299
you can't trust a damn thing
around here.

761
01:21:35,303 --> 01:21:37,180
Lincoln Exportar, buenos noches.
(Lincoln Export, good evening)

762
01:21:37,388 --> 01:21:39,807
You know when someone calls, you can
just tell 'em it's the "CIA", Felix.

763
01:21:39,807 --> 01:21:42,393
A taxi driver told me
where your office was.

764
01:21:42,393 --> 01:21:45,021
Well, if it's so easy
to find, James...

765
01:21:45,021 --> 01:21:47,273
you really should come visit.

766
01:21:47,815 --> 01:21:50,735
Or maybe you should go out
and see some more of the city.

767
01:22:11,923 --> 01:22:13,675
I heard a rumor you'd gone native.

768
01:22:13,675 --> 01:22:15,635
Felix.

769
01:22:15,635 --> 01:22:18,096
- ¿Qué le gusta? (What would you like?)
- Una cerveza, por favor. (a beer, please.)

770
01:22:19,681 --> 01:22:22,225
You know, I was just wondering
what South America would look like...

771
01:22:22,225 --> 01:22:24,352
if nobody gave a damn
about coke or communism.

772
01:22:24,352 --> 01:22:26,980
It always impressed me the way
you boys would carve this place up.

773
01:22:26,980 --> 01:22:29,566
I'll take that as a compliment
coming from a Brit.

774
01:22:31,734 --> 01:22:34,153
Are you sure you're playing
with the right side?

775
01:22:34,654 --> 01:22:36,739
Regimes change
once a week down here.

776
01:22:36,739 --> 01:22:38,950
Medrano will be no dirtier
than the next guy.

777
01:22:38,950 --> 01:22:40,952
Oh you see, that's what I like
about U.S. intelligence...

778
01:22:40,952 --> 01:22:43,788
- you'll lie down with anybody.
- Including you brother.

779
01:22:43,788 --> 01:22:47,375
- Including you.
- Do you know you're being played?

780
01:22:47,375 --> 01:22:50,170
Dominic Greene is gonna suck this
place dry and then he's gonna move on...

781
01:22:50,170 --> 01:22:52,380
and you're gonna be left
picking up the broken crockery...

782
01:22:52,380 --> 01:22:55,133
What can I tell you, there's
no such thing as a free lunch.

783
01:22:55,133 --> 01:22:58,469
You see Felix, I do not think you're
half as cynical as you make out to be.

784
01:22:58,469 --> 01:23:00,638
You don't know me.

785
01:23:01,347 --> 01:23:03,558
Why?...

786
01:23:03,558 --> 01:23:05,560
Just because you didn't come alone?

787
01:23:05,977 --> 01:23:09,189
- How long have I got?
- 30 seconds.

788
01:23:10,481 --> 01:23:12,525
Well, that doesn't give us
a lotta time, does it?

789
01:23:14,819 --> 01:23:18,156
Medrano can't move until he's pays
off the army and the police chief.

790
01:23:18,156 --> 01:23:20,867
Greene's bringing him
his money now at the hotel called...

791
01:23:20,867 --> 01:23:24,746
"Pérola de las Dunas",
in the desert.

792
01:23:24,746 --> 01:23:26,748
Thank you, Felix.

793
01:23:26,748 --> 01:23:28,666
James!
Move your ass!

794
01:23:54,192 --> 01:23:56,903
What the hell happened?
What did you tell him?

795
01:23:56,903 --> 01:23:58,863
Just what we agreed.

796
01:25:22,447 --> 01:25:24,365
What're you doing?

797
01:25:26,201 --> 01:25:27,827
It slides cocked.

798
01:25:28,912 --> 01:25:31,080
Maybe you should check your own.

799
01:25:31,414 --> 01:25:33,082
I will.

800
01:25:37,754 --> 01:25:40,215
Have you ever killed someone?

801
01:25:43,718 --> 01:25:47,514
The training will tell you that when the
adrenalin kicks in, you should compensate.

802
01:25:48,598 --> 01:25:52,769
But part of you is not gonna believe in the
training because this kill here is personal.

803
01:25:54,354 --> 01:25:56,731
<i>Take a deep breath.</i>

804
01:25:56,731 --> 01:25:58,525
You only need one shot.

805
01:25:58,525 --> 01:26:00,860
Make it count.

806
01:26:10,828 --> 01:26:13,206
General, he is here.

807
01:26:13,748 --> 01:26:16,334
- The time has come, General.
- Let's go.

808
01:26:58,877 --> 01:27:04,132
- Welcome.
- How are you?

809
01:27:07,468 --> 01:27:11,264
In Euros... as requested.

810
01:27:11,264 --> 01:27:13,892
The Dollar isn't what it once was.

811
01:27:13,892 --> 01:27:15,977
The cost of war.

812
01:27:17,770 --> 01:27:20,773
Yes, I'm afraid that the corruption
in this current Government...

813
01:27:20,773 --> 01:27:22,358
can no longer be tolerated

814
01:27:23,735 --> 01:27:25,195
Presidente?

815
01:27:25,195 --> 01:27:26,905
And mine?

816
01:27:27,113 --> 01:27:29,699
You'll get that as soon
as you sign over my land.

817
01:27:45,882 --> 01:27:48,301
My first official act.

818
01:27:53,723 --> 01:27:55,391
And this, if you would.

819
01:27:55,808 --> 01:27:57,393
What is this?

820
01:27:57,393 --> 01:28:00,271
As of this moment,
my organization owns...

821
01:28:00,271 --> 01:28:03,942
more than 60%
of Bolivia's water supply.

822
01:28:03,942 --> 01:28:07,403
And this contract states
that your new government...

823
01:28:07,403 --> 01:28:11,241
will use us as utilities provider.

824
01:28:11,324 --> 01:28:14,452
This is double
what we're paying now.

825
01:28:17,622 --> 01:28:20,083
Oh... well, then don't sign it!

826
01:28:20,708 --> 01:28:26,339
But you should know something about me
and the people I work with.

827
01:28:26,548 --> 01:28:32,512
We deal with the left or the right,
or dictators or deposed dictators.

828
01:28:32,804 --> 01:28:37,600
If the current president had been more
agreeable, I wouldn't be talking to you.

829
01:28:37,684 --> 01:28:41,688
So, if you decide not to sign,
you'll wake up with your balls...

830
01:28:41,688 --> 01:28:46,192
in your mouth and your willing
replacement standing over you.

831
01:28:47,777 --> 01:28:51,030
If you doubt that then shoot me,
take that money...

832
01:28:51,030 --> 01:28:54,200
and have a good night's sleep.

833
01:29:53,176 --> 01:29:56,012
You and I had a mutual friend.

834
01:32:45,807 --> 01:32:48,643
Sounds like
you just lost another one.

835
01:33:58,213 --> 01:34:02,967
Not this way, not this way!
I can't... I can't.

836
01:34:21,069 --> 01:34:22,695
Make your shot.

837
01:34:22,695 --> 01:34:24,781
Take a deep breath.

838
01:34:25,573 --> 01:34:27,909
Make it count.

839
01:34:43,299 --> 01:34:45,009
Come on!

840
01:34:59,023 --> 01:35:01,025
Wait here.

841
01:35:32,015 --> 01:35:34,017
You promised that you...

842
01:35:34,017 --> 01:35:35,852
Let you go?

843
01:35:36,060 --> 01:35:38,771
I answered your questions.

844
01:35:39,105 --> 01:35:41,900
I told you what you wanted to know
about Quantum.

845
01:35:41,900 --> 01:35:43,276
Yes, you did.

846
01:35:43,276 --> 01:35:46,696
And your friends would know that,
so they're probably be looking for you.

847
01:35:46,696 --> 01:35:48,072
But the good news is...

848
01:35:48,072 --> 01:35:50,116
you're in the middle of the desert.

849
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:55,663
Here.

850
01:35:57,123 --> 01:36:00,877
I bet you make it 20 miles
before you consider drinking that.

851
01:36:00,877 --> 01:36:02,962
Goodbye, Mr. Greene.

852
01:36:02,962 --> 01:36:06,382
<i>Motor Oil</i>

853
01:36:42,710 --> 01:36:44,295
Thank you.

854
01:36:44,295 --> 01:36:46,047
It's my pleasure.

855
01:36:47,298 --> 01:36:48,967
Are you alright?

856
01:36:49,509 --> 01:36:51,261
I'm fine.

857
01:36:51,302 --> 01:36:55,890
But I keep thinking, he's dead,
and now what?

858
01:36:55,890 --> 01:36:58,560
Well, the dam we saw
will have to come down.

859
01:36:58,560 --> 01:36:59,769
And there'll be others too...

860
01:36:59,811 --> 01:37:02,230
someone who worked for Greene
might be of help.

861
01:37:03,398 --> 01:37:05,567
Not a bad idea.

862
01:37:10,071 --> 01:37:12,740
Do you think I'll be able
to sleep now?

863
01:37:15,160 --> 01:37:18,163
I don't think the dead
care about vengence.

864
01:37:20,790 --> 01:37:24,210
I wish... I could set you free.

865
01:37:27,672 --> 01:37:30,341
But your prison is in there.

866
01:38:21,100 --> 01:38:25,647
Fine, anything for an easy life.

867
01:38:26,856 --> 01:38:28,191
Sit down.

868
01:38:28,942 --> 01:38:31,110
Sit down!

869
01:38:31,778 --> 01:38:33,530
It's okay, baby.

870
01:38:50,129 --> 01:38:52,507
You're Canadian?

871
01:38:52,507 --> 01:38:54,801
You work in Canadian intelligence?

872
01:38:54,801 --> 01:38:57,428
I'm sorry, I know you do.

873
01:38:57,428 --> 01:38:59,722
And knowing this man..

874
01:38:59,722 --> 01:39:02,141
I guess you have access
to some very sensitive material...

875
01:39:02,141 --> 01:39:04,102
which you will be forced
to give up.

876
01:39:04,102 --> 01:39:05,478
His life will be threatened...

877
01:39:05,478 --> 01:39:08,773
and because you love him...
you won't hesitate.

878
01:39:09,107 --> 01:39:11,484
That's a beautiful necklace.

879
01:39:12,026 --> 01:39:14,195
Did he give it to you?

880
01:39:15,864 --> 01:39:18,700
I have one just like it...

881
01:39:21,286 --> 01:39:23,788
He gave it to a friend of mine.

882
01:39:23,830 --> 01:39:27,041
Someone very close to me.

883
01:39:29,043 --> 01:39:31,045
- Your name is?
- Corine.

884
01:39:31,045 --> 01:39:32,672
Corine.

885
01:39:32,881 --> 01:39:35,633
Corine, I suggest you leave now,
you contact you're people...

886
01:39:35,633 --> 01:39:38,928
and you tell them to check
their seals they have a leak.

887
01:39:39,053 --> 01:39:41,306
Do it now, please.

888
01:39:41,890 --> 01:39:45,310
This man and I
have some unfinished business.

889
01:39:55,570 --> 01:39:57,197
Thank you.

890
01:40:01,284 --> 01:40:03,036
Please.

891
01:40:03,244 --> 01:40:05,288
Make it quick.

892
01:40:14,255 --> 01:40:15,924
He is still alive?

893
01:40:15,924 --> 01:40:17,383
He is.

894
01:40:17,592 --> 01:40:19,260
I'm surprised.

895
01:40:20,094 --> 01:40:22,597
Did you find what you were looking for?

896
01:40:22,597 --> 01:40:24,474
- Yes.
- Good.

897
01:40:25,350 --> 01:40:28,228
- I assume you have no regrets.
- I don't.

898
01:40:28,353 --> 01:40:30,021
What about you?

899
01:40:30,438 --> 01:40:32,982
Of course not.
It would be unprofessional.

900
01:40:34,484 --> 01:40:38,363
They found Greene dead in the middle
of the Bolivian desert, of all places.

901
01:40:38,363 --> 01:40:40,907
Two bullets in the back of his skull.

902
01:40:40,907 --> 01:40:43,701
They found motor oil
in his stomach.

903
01:40:43,701 --> 01:40:45,411
Does that mean anything to you?

904
01:40:45,411 --> 01:40:46,621
I wish I could help.

905
01:40:46,621 --> 01:40:47,747
You'll be glad to know...

906
01:40:47,747 --> 01:40:49,874
I straightened things out
with the Americans.

907
01:40:49,874 --> 01:40:52,293
Your friend Leiter
has been promoted.

908
01:40:52,293 --> 01:40:53,628
He'll replace Beam.

909
01:40:53,628 --> 01:40:56,047
Well then, the right people
kept their jobs.

910
01:40:56,047 --> 01:40:58,007
Something like that.

911
01:40:59,467 --> 01:41:01,719
Congratulations, you were right.

912
01:41:01,970 --> 01:41:03,513
About what?

913
01:41:04,264 --> 01:41:06,224
About Vesper.

914
01:41:08,017 --> 01:41:09,894
Ma'am!

915
01:41:11,771 --> 01:41:13,648
Bond.

916
01:41:14,274 --> 01:41:16,234
I need you back.

917
01:41:16,651 --> 01:41:19,153
I never left.

918
01:41:19,153 --> 01:41:40,008
