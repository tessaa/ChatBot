1
00:01:15,423 --> 00:01:17,974
Quick! We can't
hold him back much longer.

2
00:01:21,116 --> 00:01:22,278
Hurry!

3
00:01:25,532 --> 00:01:26,806
Come on!

4
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:35,474
Quick!

5
00:01:40,322 --> 00:01:41,379
Faster!

6
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:55,594
Up on the balcony!
Come on! Quickly!

7
00:02:22,455 --> 00:02:25,251
Just read them
the sentence!

8
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,868
The sentence of the court...

9
00:02:30,181 --> 00:02:31,995
is that in two days hence...

10
00:02:32,491 --> 00:02:36,528
the perfumer journeyman:
Jean-Baptiste Grenouille...

11
00:02:37,112 --> 00:02:39,353
shall be bound
to a wooden cross...

12
00:02:39,543 --> 00:02:42,567
with his face raised
towards heaven!

13
00:02:44,024 --> 00:02:46,136
And whilst still alive...

14
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:50,355
be dealt twelve blows
with an iron rod...

15
00:02:52,668 --> 00:02:55,487
breaking the joints
of his arms...

16
00:02:56,683 --> 00:02:57,595
his shoulders...

17
00:02:58,357 --> 00:02:59,687
his hips...

18
00:03:00,404 --> 00:03:02,073
his legs!

19
00:03:03,307 --> 00:03:07,369
He shall then be raised up
to hang until dead.

20
00:03:07,883 --> 00:03:11,043
And all customary acts of mercy...

21
00:03:11,151 --> 00:03:14,061
are expressly forbidden
the executioner.

22
00:03:22,705 --> 00:03:24,903
In 18th century France...

23
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:30,911
there lived a man who was one of the most gifted
and notorious personages of his time.

24
00:03:31,353 --> 00:03:34,273
His name was
Jean-Baptiste Grenouille.

25
00:03:34,975 --> 00:03:39,074
And if his name has been forgotten today,
it is for the sole reason...

26
00:03:39,115 --> 00:03:41,989
that his entire ambition
was restricted to a domain...

27
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:45,738
that leaves no trace in history:

28
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:52,078
to the fleeting realm of scent.

29
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:57,650
PERFUME
The Story of a Murderer

30
00:04:05,288 --> 00:04:07,264
In the period of which we speak...

31
00:04:07,365 --> 00:04:12,883
there reigned in the cities a stench
barely conceivable to us modern men and women.

32
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:16,932
Naturally, the stench
was foulest in Paris...

33
00:04:16,967 --> 00:04:19,908
for Paris was
the largest city in Europe.

34
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:23,638
And nowhere in Paris was that stench
more profoundly repugnant...

35
00:04:23,739 --> 00:04:25,923
than in the city's fish market.

36
00:04:27,486 --> 00:04:30,767
Here we are.
I'll get another box.

37
00:04:31,451 --> 00:04:35,418
It was here then,
on the most putrid spot in the whole kingdom...

38
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:38,042
that Jean-Baptiste Grenouille was born...

39
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:40,838
on the 17th of July, 1738.

40
00:05:04,185 --> 00:05:06,078
It was his mother's fifth birth.

41
00:05:06,427 --> 00:05:09,117
She delivered them all here
under her fish stand.

42
00:05:09,221 --> 00:05:11,768
And all had been stillbirths,
or semi-stillbirths.

43
00:05:11,941 --> 00:05:12,942
Are you alright?

44
00:05:13,893 --> 00:05:16,411
And by evening, the whole mess
had been shoveled away...

45
00:05:16,481 --> 00:05:18,201
with the fish guts
into the river.

46
00:05:18,953 --> 00:05:20,851
It would be much the same today...

47
00:05:21,638 --> 00:05:23,058
but then...

48
00:05:23,646 --> 00:05:26,459
Jean-Baptiste chose differently.

49
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:00,044
What's that noise?

50
00:06:00,674 --> 00:06:02,475
It's... it's a baby.

51
00:06:02,476 --> 00:06:03,782
What's going on here?

52
00:06:07,619 --> 00:06:10,402
- It's a newborn.
- Where's his mother?

53
00:06:11,852 --> 00:06:13,060
She was just here.

54
00:06:15,534 --> 00:06:20,710
She tried to kill it, her own child.
She tried to kill a baby!

55
00:06:22,528 --> 00:06:24,125
There! There she is!

56
00:06:24,376 --> 00:06:26,841
- Stop! Stop where you are!
- Murderer!

57
00:06:26,926 --> 00:06:30,454
Thus, the first sound
to escape Grenouille's lips...

58
00:06:31,037 --> 00:06:32,715
sent his mother
to the gallows.

59
00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:39,057
And Jean-Baptiste,
by official order...

60
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:42,235
to the orphange
of Madame Gaillard.

61
00:06:45,317 --> 00:06:50,297
- How many today?
- Four, well... three and a half.

62
00:06:54,245 --> 00:06:59,644
- As usual, more dead than alive.
- Just take the money and sign!

63
00:07:06,572 --> 00:07:10,173
- Make room!
- Where?

64
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:11,113
Move!

65
00:07:25,589 --> 00:07:26,856
Is he dead?

66
00:07:52,771 --> 00:07:56,329
- That's not staying in my bed.
- Let's throw it out then.

67
00:07:56,524 --> 00:08:00,201
- What if it screams?
- It's just a kiddie.

68
00:08:18,552 --> 00:08:20,704
Harder! Push!

69
00:08:22,071 --> 00:08:24,268
What are you doing?

70
00:08:32,242 --> 00:08:33,107
For Madame Gaillard...

71
00:08:33,182 --> 00:08:36,226
Grenouille was a source of income
just like any other.

72
00:08:36,956 --> 00:08:42,594
The children, however, sensed at once
that there was something different about him.

73
00:08:58,493 --> 00:09:02,875
By the age of five, Jean-Baptiste
still could not talk.

74
00:09:03,921 --> 00:09:08,410
But he had been born with a talent
that made him unique among their kind.

75
00:10:08,814 --> 00:10:11,311
It was not that the other children
hated him...

76
00:10:12,106 --> 00:10:14,880
they felt unnerved
by him.

77
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:22,726
Increasingly, he became aware
that his phenomenal sense of smell...

78
00:10:22,819 --> 00:10:25,170
was a gift that had been give to him...

79
00:10:25,546 --> 00:10:27,135
and him alone.

80
00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:38,462
When Jean-Baptiste did
finally learn to speak...

81
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:40,781
he soon found
that everyday language...

82
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:45,971
proved inadequate for all the olfactory experience
he's accumulating within himself.

83
00:10:50,194 --> 00:10:51,618
Wood.

84
00:10:57,308 --> 00:10:58,602
Warm wood.

85
00:10:59,923 --> 00:11:03,645
Grass... wet grass.

86
00:11:04,508 --> 00:11:07,844
Stones... warm stones.

87
00:11:10,656 --> 00:11:14,903
Water... cold water.

88
00:11:21,198 --> 00:11:22,354
Frog.

89
00:11:24,786 --> 00:11:26,548
Wet stones.

90
00:11:27,181 --> 00:11:30,733
Big wet frog stones.

91
00:11:32,303 --> 00:11:33,836
Something...

92
00:11:35,747 --> 00:11:38,670
something, something.

93
00:11:40,112 --> 00:11:44,782
By the age of thirteen, Madame Gaillard
no longer had room for Jean-Baptiste...

94
00:11:45,128 --> 00:11:46,591
and therefore decided
to sell him.

95
00:11:46,592 --> 00:11:47,753
Come on!

96
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,017
Ten francs.

97
00:11:53,909 --> 00:11:57,004
From his first breath
of the odor enveloping this man...

98
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:59,165
Seven, it's not worth so much.

99
00:11:59,481 --> 00:12:02,425
Grenouille knew that his life
in Grimal's tannery...

100
00:12:02,612 --> 00:12:04,075
would be worth precisely
as much...

101
00:12:04,198 --> 00:12:05,915
as the work
he could accomplish.

102
00:12:09,318 --> 00:12:11,107
Unfortunately for Madame Gaillard...

103
00:12:14,632 --> 00:12:17,367
the bargain was short-lived.

104
00:12:23,215 --> 00:12:26,594
Life expectancy in the tannery
was a mere five years.

105
00:12:27,211 --> 00:12:31,000
But Jean-Baptiste proved to be
as tough as a resilient bacterium.

106
00:12:31,813 --> 00:12:33,482
He adjusted to
his new fate...

107
00:12:33,483 --> 00:12:36,494
and became a paragon
of docility and diligence...

108
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:40,781
slaved 15, 16 hours a day,
summer and winter.

109
00:12:42,173 --> 00:12:46,508
Gradually, he became aware
of a world beyond the tannery...

110
00:12:47,496 --> 00:12:51,851
where utopia of unexplored smells
lay in store for him.

111
00:13:15,314 --> 00:13:16,361
Grenouille.

112
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:23,349
Come with us.
I'm taking you to town for delivery.

113
00:13:24,385 --> 00:13:28,659
Jean-Baptiste Grenouille
had triumphed. He was alive.

114
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,480
And at last, he was in his element.

115
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,867
He was not choosing.

116
00:14:12,402 --> 00:14:15,131
He did not differentiate between
what is commonly considered to be...

117
00:14:15,178 --> 00:14:17,193
good smells from bad.

118
00:14:18,538 --> 00:14:21,294
At least, not yet.

119
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:25,637
He was very greedy.

120
00:14:26,075 --> 00:14:27,936
The goal was to possess...

121
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:31,363
everything the world had to offer
in the way of odors.

122
00:14:32,094 --> 00:14:36,046
His only condition being...
that they were new ones.

123
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:42,237
Thousands upon thousands of odors
formed an invisible gruel...

124
00:14:42,378 --> 00:14:46,602
which he dissected into its
smallest and most remote parts of pieces.

125
00:15:02,692 --> 00:15:03,976
Grenouille!

126
00:15:07,772 --> 00:15:09,239
Come on!

127
00:15:13,053 --> 00:15:14,722
Your ass over here.

128
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:29,175
- What is it called?
- "Amor and Psyche", madame.

129
00:16:29,481 --> 00:16:31,008
My little creation.

130
00:16:31,562 --> 00:16:35,650
- May I try it?
- If you allow me, mademoiselle.

131
00:16:43,048 --> 00:16:45,463
Sheer heaven...

132
00:16:47,957 --> 00:16:51,851
Monsieur P¨¦lissier, you are
truly an artiste.

133
00:19:14,597 --> 00:19:15,812
What do you want?

134
00:19:24,567 --> 00:19:25,772
Want to buy some?

135
00:19:39,087 --> 00:19:40,357
Two for a sou.

136
00:25:38,005 --> 00:25:39,716
That's for you
running off like that.

137
00:25:40,493 --> 00:25:41,661
I'll kill you!

138
00:25:45,328 --> 00:25:48,041
That night, he could not sleep.

139
00:25:48,908 --> 00:25:53,373
The intoxicating power of the girls's scent
suddenly made it clear to him...

140
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:57,574
why he had come to his own life
so tenaciously, so savagely.

141
00:25:59,179 --> 00:26:00,464
The meaning and purpose...

142
00:26:00,556 --> 00:26:03,461
of his miserable existence
had a higher destiny.

143
00:26:04,787 --> 00:26:07,548
He would learn
how to preserve scent...

144
00:26:07,764 --> 00:26:11,943
so that never again would he lose
such sublime beauty.

145
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:38,685
There were about a dozen perfumers
in Paris in those days.

146
00:26:39,699 --> 00:26:44,047
One of them, the one celebrated
Italian perfumer, Giuseppe Baldini,

147
00:26:44,138 --> 00:26:46,132
had set up shop
in the center of the bridge,

148
00:26:46,198 --> 00:26:50,580
called "the Pont au Change" on his arrival
in Paris over thirty years ago.

149
00:26:51,297 --> 00:26:53,893
To be sure,
at one time in his youth,

150
00:26:54,073 --> 00:26:59,028
Baldini had created several truly great perfumes
to which he owed his fortune.

151
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:05,284
But now, Baldini was out of touch,
out of fashion,

152
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:09,465
and spent his days
waiting for customers that no longer came.

153
00:27:11,194 --> 00:27:13,075
- Ch¨¦nier! There you are!
- Monsieur Baldini.

154
00:27:13,076 --> 00:27:14,380
Put on your wig.

155
00:27:14,956 --> 00:27:16,372
Put on your wig!

156
00:27:18,728 --> 00:27:19,692
You going out?

157
00:27:20,487 --> 00:27:22,526
I will retire to my study
for a few hours,

158
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,232
and do not want to be disturbed
under any circumstances.

159
00:27:25,336 --> 00:27:27,349
Will you be creating
a new perfume, Monsieur Baldini?

160
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,646
Correct.
For Count Verhamont.

161
00:27:30,156 --> 00:27:32,485
He's asked for something like...

162
00:27:32,538 --> 00:27:36,431
I think he said it was called...
"Amor and Psyche"?

163
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:39,071
That swindler in the
rue Saint-Andr¨¦-des-Arts.

164
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:42,658
- P¨¦lissier.
- P¨¦lissier! That's him.

165
00:27:44,211 --> 00:27:45,544
"Amor and Psyche"ê.

166
00:27:50,277 --> 00:27:52,221
- Do you know it?
- Oh, yes.

167
00:27:52,305 --> 00:27:54,300
You can smell it everywhere
these days, monsieur.

168
00:27:55,216 --> 00:27:56,522
Every street corner.

169
00:27:58,015 --> 00:28:01,285
In fact, I just purchased
you a sample.

170
00:28:03,165 --> 00:28:04,876
In case you wanted
to test it.

171
00:28:07,338 --> 00:28:10,524
What on earth makes you think
I'd be interested in testing it?

172
00:28:12,213 --> 00:28:14,531
You're right.
It's nothing special.

173
00:28:15,144 --> 00:28:17,821
Actually, it's a very
common scent.

174
00:28:18,512 --> 00:28:21,435
I believe the head cord
contains lime oil.

175
00:28:23,138 --> 00:28:26,332
Really? And the heart cord?

176
00:28:26,984 --> 00:28:29,242
Orange blossom, I believe.

177
00:28:29,774 --> 00:28:34,111
And civet in the base cord,
but I cannot say for sure.

178
00:28:34,273 --> 00:28:37,980
Well, I couldn't care less what that bungler
P¨¦lissier slops into his perfumes.

179
00:28:38,338 --> 00:28:39,600
Naturally not, monsieur.

180
00:28:40,126 --> 00:28:43,350
And I am thinking of creating something
for Count Verhamont...

181
00:28:43,651 --> 00:28:46,983
that will cause
a veritable sensation.

182
00:28:47,294 --> 00:28:49,066
I'm sure it will, Monsieur Baldini.

183
00:28:50,158 --> 00:28:54,159
Take charge of the shop, Ch¨¦nier.
And don't let anyone come near me.

184
00:28:54,273 --> 00:28:57,283
Inspiration requires
peace and tranquility.

185
00:28:58,406 --> 00:29:01,215
Vanessa! Bring me the handkerchiefs!

186
00:29:30,572 --> 00:29:31,976
Here are your handkerchiefs.

187
00:29:32,105 --> 00:29:34,697
Grazie... grazie... grazie!

188
00:29:37,483 --> 00:29:39,378
Is there anything else
you need?

189
00:29:40,316 --> 00:29:42,140
Inspiration, perhaps.

190
00:29:42,401 --> 00:29:43,791
Come on, Giuseppe!

191
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:49,111
You're still
the great perfumer Baldini.

192
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:43,479
Bellissimo...
Wonderful...

193
00:30:47,404 --> 00:30:49,076
He did it again.

194
00:30:55,071 --> 00:30:58,108
Lime oil, yes indeed.

195
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:04,180
Orange blossom, to be sure.

196
00:31:08,264 --> 00:31:10,274
And a hint of cloves, perhaps.

197
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:13,457
No...

198
00:31:15,042 --> 00:31:16,556
Well, could be cinnamon.

199
00:31:18,917 --> 00:31:19,748
It's gone.

200
00:31:23,369 --> 00:31:24,500
Cinnamon.

201
00:31:25,386 --> 00:31:26,757
It's not cinnamon...

202
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:31,599
Cloves.

203
00:31:32,109 --> 00:31:32,570
No...

204
00:31:33,492 --> 00:31:34,466
Musk?

205
00:31:34,675 --> 00:31:35,636
No.

206
00:32:14,657 --> 00:32:15,402
Who's there?

207
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:17,613
I'm from Grimal's tannery.

208
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:23,153
I've brought
the goatskins you ordered.

209
00:32:28,838 --> 00:32:30,028
Follow me.

210
00:32:36,064 --> 00:32:37,250
This way.

211
00:33:10,097 --> 00:33:12,819
There. Leave them there.

212
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,425
Tell your master
the skins are fine.

213
00:33:23,945 --> 00:33:26,205
I'll come by the next few days
and pay for them.

214
00:33:27,353 --> 00:33:28,723
Yes, monsieur.

215
00:33:34,835 --> 00:33:37,721
You want to make this leather
smell good, don't you?

216
00:33:39,092 --> 00:33:44,202
- Why, of course.
- With "Amor and Psyche" by P¨¦lissier?

217
00:33:48,007 --> 00:33:51,917
Whatever gave you the absurb idea
I would use someone else's perfume?

218
00:33:53,052 --> 00:33:53,879
It's all over you.

219
00:33:54,351 --> 00:33:56,616
It's on your forehead,
your nose, your hands.

220
00:33:56,630 --> 00:34:01,428
It's bad, "Amor and Psyche" is, master.
There's too much rosemary in it, and too much of...

221
00:34:03,093 --> 00:34:05,237
that and that.

222
00:34:07,905 --> 00:34:11,399
Bergamot and patchouli.

223
00:34:11,454 --> 00:34:12,465
Pa...

224
00:34:13,283 --> 00:34:15,756
- Patchouli.
- Patchou...

225
00:34:20,839 --> 00:34:22,031
What else?

226
00:34:25,036 --> 00:34:26,511
That and that.

227
00:34:28,369 --> 00:34:29,586
That and that.

228
00:34:38,745 --> 00:34:40,183
Orange blossom.

229
00:34:41,766 --> 00:34:42,856
Lime.

230
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,562
- Musk.
- Musk.

231
00:34:48,666 --> 00:34:50,247
And cloves.

232
00:34:50,561 --> 00:34:52,068
And this.

233
00:35:00,206 --> 00:35:02,927
- Storax?
- That's in it too.

234
00:35:03,002 --> 00:35:05,803
- Storax. Storax.
- Storax. Storax.

235
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:14,889
You have, it appears,
a fine nose, young man. But...

236
00:35:14,948 --> 00:35:18,757
My nose knows all the smells in the world.
It's the best nose in Paris.

237
00:35:18,944 --> 00:35:21,196
Only I don't know the names.
I need to learn the names...

238
00:35:21,229 --> 00:35:23,049
- learn them all...
- No! No! No! Basta!

239
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,872
You don't interrupt me when I'm speaking.

240
00:35:24,919 --> 00:35:27,170
You're both impertinent
and insolent!

241
00:35:28,129 --> 00:35:30,434
Even I don't know every scent.

242
00:35:32,573 --> 00:35:35,855
I, of course, know for some time
the ingredients of "Amor and Psyche".

243
00:35:35,856 --> 00:35:39,792
But all it needs to find that out
is a passably fine nose, nothing else.

244
00:35:41,766 --> 00:35:44,983
But it needs the craft
of a true perfumer...

245
00:35:45,813 --> 00:35:47,607
to detect the exact formula.

246
00:35:48,042 --> 00:35:52,442
Which notes, which cords.
And in what precise measurements.

247
00:35:53,856 --> 00:35:56,849
Could you tell me the exact formula
of "Amor and Psyche"ê?

248
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:01,115
"Best nose in Paris".

249
00:36:06,439 --> 00:36:07,786
Speak up!

250
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:11,732
You see, you can't, can you?
And I'll tell you why.

251
00:36:12,981 --> 00:36:15,516
Because talent means
next to nothing!

252
00:36:17,652 --> 00:36:20,151
While experience, acquired in humility...

253
00:36:20,662 --> 00:36:23,938
and hard work, means everything.

254
00:36:28,194 --> 00:36:30,665
I don't, I don't know
what a formula is.

255
00:36:30,867 --> 00:36:33,697
But I can make
"Amor and Psyche" for you now.

256
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:38,058
And you think I'll just let you
slop around in my laboratory...

257
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:40,053
with essential oils
that are worth a fortune?

258
00:36:40,389 --> 00:36:41,300
You?

259
00:36:42,406 --> 00:36:44,821
- Yes.
- Now pay attention!

260
00:36:48,072 --> 00:36:49,481
What is your name, anyway?

261
00:36:51,435 --> 00:36:53,117
Jean-Baptiste Grenouille.

262
00:36:55,875 --> 00:36:58,243
Very well, Jean-Baptiste Grenouille.

263
00:36:59,996 --> 00:37:03,271
You shall have the opportunity now,
this very moment, to prove your assertion.

264
00:37:03,324 --> 00:37:06,360
Your grandiose failure will also be
an opportunity for you to learn...

265
00:37:06,406 --> 00:37:09,597
- the virture of humility.
- How much do you want me to make?

266
00:37:09,647 --> 00:37:13,037
- How much of... what?
- How much "Amor and Psyche" do you want?

267
00:37:15,737 --> 00:37:19,567
- Shall I fill this flask?
- No! You shall not!

268
00:37:28,544 --> 00:37:31,106
- You may fill this one.
- Yes, master.

269
00:37:34,025 --> 00:37:36,154
- But, Master Baldini,
- Hmm?

270
00:37:36,498 --> 00:37:39,060
you must let me do it
in my own way.

271
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:41,277
As you please.

272
00:37:47,508 --> 00:37:49,747
Don't drop that!
That's pure alcohol!

273
00:37:49,819 --> 00:37:51,961
You want to blow up
the entire building?

274
00:37:54,403 --> 00:37:56,032
You have to measure it first!

275
00:38:43,044 --> 00:38:46,356
Stop! Stop it!
That's enough! Basta!

276
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:47,975
You know nothing!

277
00:38:48,446 --> 00:38:52,945
Essential oils are always to be
mixed first, then the alcohol added.

278
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,125
And never ever let this perfume
to be shaken like that.

279
00:38:56,411 --> 00:38:59,597
I must've been insane
to listen to your asinine gibberish.

280
00:39:01,455 --> 00:39:03,015
Yes, we're done.

281
00:39:31,645 --> 00:39:33,275
Mamamiya...

282
00:39:47,094 --> 00:39:49,324
This is "Amor and Psyche".

283
00:39:50,131 --> 00:39:52,384
But it's not a good perfume, master.

284
00:39:53,898 --> 00:39:57,251
If you let me again, master,
I'll make it more better.

285
00:41:09,241 --> 00:41:11,386
That's a really good perfume.

286
00:41:18,006 --> 00:41:20,116
Don't you want
to smell it, master?

287
00:41:20,167 --> 00:41:21,923
I'm not in the mood
to test it now.

288
00:41:21,972 --> 00:41:24,665
I have other things
on my mind. Go now.

289
00:41:26,453 --> 00:41:28,884
- But, master...
- Go now!

290
00:41:43,524 --> 00:41:46,424
Can't I come to work
for you, master, can't I?

291
00:41:48,535 --> 00:41:50,598
- Let me think about it.
- Master!

292
00:41:52,211 --> 00:41:55,215
I have to learn
how to keep smell.

293
00:41:56,643 --> 00:42:00,862
- What?
- Can you teach me that?

294
00:42:01,378 --> 00:42:03,561
I shall have to think
about it. Now go.

295
00:42:48,058 --> 00:42:49,572
I love you.

296
00:42:55,844 --> 00:42:58,277
I'll give you 50 francs for him.

297
00:43:05,329 --> 00:43:06,888
Grenouille!

298
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:10,631
Grimal's transaction had
a profound effect on all three parties.

299
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:11,711
Hey, watch out!

300
00:43:15,278 --> 00:43:18,270
Now at least, upon
Monsieur Grimal himself.

301
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:22,731
As for Giuseppe Baldini,

302
00:43:22,799 --> 00:43:27,323
the acquisition of Grenouille miraculously
transformed his dwindling business,

303
00:43:27,389 --> 00:43:30,215
even surpassing
its former glory.

304
00:43:37,938 --> 00:43:39,994
While at last, for Jean-Baptiste,

305
00:43:40,308 --> 00:43:44,879
the mysterious secret
of the perfumers' craft began to unfold.

306
00:43:50,988 --> 00:43:53,470
Now, pay careful attention
to what I tell you.

307
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:54,988
Just like a musical cord,

308
00:43:55,046 --> 00:43:58,799
a perfume cord contains
four essences, or notes,

309
00:43:58,858 --> 00:44:01,985
carefully selected
for their harmonic affinity.

310
00:44:02,042 --> 00:44:07,286
Each perfume contains three cords:
the head, the heart and the base,

311
00:44:07,323 --> 00:44:09,872
necessitating twelve notes in all.

312
00:44:10,467 --> 00:44:13,370
The head cord contains
the first impression,

313
00:44:13,428 --> 00:44:16,892
lasting only a few minutes,
before giving way to the heart cord:

314
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:20,546
the theme of the perfume,
lasting several hours.

315
00:44:20,584 --> 00:44:23,207
Finally, the base cord:

316
00:44:23,527 --> 00:44:27,218
the trail of the perfume,
lasting several days.

317
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:36,209
Mind you, the ancient Egyptians believed
that one can only create a truly original perfume...

318
00:44:36,274 --> 00:44:42,644
by adding an extra note,
one final essence that will ring out...

319
00:44:43,134 --> 00:44:45,292
and dominate the others.

320
00:44:47,470 --> 00:44:51,872
Legend has it that a jar
was once found in a pharaoh's tomb.

321
00:44:51,972 --> 00:44:55,495
And when it was opened,
a perfume was released.

322
00:44:55,615 --> 00:44:58,515
After all those thousands of years,

323
00:44:58,575 --> 00:45:02,481
a perfume of such subtle beauty,
and yet such power,

324
00:45:02,571 --> 00:45:05,391
that for one single moment,

325
00:45:05,447 --> 00:45:09,870
every single person on earth
believed they were in paradise.

326
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:14,175
Twelve essences
could be identified.

327
00:45:15,158 --> 00:45:18,856
But the thirteenth,
the vital one...

328
00:45:20,313 --> 00:45:22,409
could never be determined.

329
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:24,936
Why not?

330
00:45:27,342 --> 00:45:27,922
Why not??

331
00:45:28,144 --> 00:45:29,677
What do you mean why not?

332
00:45:30,847 --> 00:45:33,335
Because it's a legend, numskull.

333
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:35,723
What's a legend?

334
00:45:38,294 --> 00:45:39,211
Never mind.

335
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:22,226
Jean-Baptiste. Jean-Baptiste.

336
00:46:27,846 --> 00:46:29,080
What's the matter?

337
00:46:29,634 --> 00:46:33,407
I... I have to learn
how to capture a scent.

338
00:46:35,977 --> 00:46:37,424
What are you talking about?

339
00:46:37,921 --> 00:46:42,478
I have to learn how... how to
capture a scent and "reprose" it forever.

340
00:46:42,723 --> 00:46:45,736
- You mean "preserve".
- Yes, teach me that.

341
00:46:46,086 --> 00:46:49,477
Calm down, my boy.
Calm down.

342
00:46:50,037 --> 00:46:51,578
We have work to do.

343
00:46:53,273 --> 00:46:58,454
The soul of beings is their scent.
You said that, master.

344
00:46:59,765 --> 00:47:00,649
Did I?

345
00:47:01,103 --> 00:47:04,962
I will make as many perfumes as you want.
But you have to teach me...

346
00:47:05,218 --> 00:47:07,795
how to capture
the smell of all things.

347
00:47:09,163 --> 00:47:10,482
Can you do that?

348
00:47:11,826 --> 00:47:16,158
- Well, naturally.
- Then teach me everything you know.

349
00:47:19,352 --> 00:47:21,800
And I'll make you the best perfumer
in the whole world.

350
00:47:38,970 --> 00:47:40,837
Imagine, Jean-Baptiste:

351
00:47:40,895 --> 00:47:47,254
ten thousand roses to produce
one single ounce of essential oil.

352
00:47:49,013 --> 00:47:54,901
Now, keep them flowing,
for the bottom petals will be given to stew,

353
00:47:55,139 --> 00:47:56,727
while I set up the alembic.

354
00:47:56,771 --> 00:47:58,563
And take care.
Not to damage them.

355
00:47:58,824 --> 00:48:02,555
We have to let them go to
their deaths with their scent intact.

356
00:48:20,324 --> 00:48:23,677
Perfect! Now, help me
with the boiler set.

357
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:39,831
Temperature is vital.
When the quicksilver is here,

358
00:48:39,908 --> 00:48:44,602
the heat is precisely correct,
and the oil will gradually rise.

359
00:48:45,950 --> 00:48:51,310
Note that this mechanism is
a remarkable invention of my own devising.

360
00:48:51,854 --> 00:48:57,521
You will observe how cold water
is pumped through here,

361
00:48:58,152 --> 00:49:03,001
allowing the essence
to condense here...

362
00:49:03,057 --> 00:49:04,922
until it finally...

363
00:49:06,085 --> 00:49:07,382
appears...

364
00:49:08,858 --> 00:49:10,113
here!

365
00:49:11,053 --> 00:49:17,153
Of course, out on the hillside above Grasse,
we had only to bellow pure fresh air.

366
00:49:18,156 --> 00:49:21,150
Ah, Grasse! What a town.

367
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:28,540
The Rome of scents.
The Promised Land of perfume.

368
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:34,215
No man can rightly
call himself a perfumer,

369
00:49:34,562 --> 00:49:38,744
unless he has proved his worth
in that hallowed place.

370
00:49:41,076 --> 00:49:43,683
Not to worry!
It happens all the time.

371
00:49:45,256 --> 00:49:46,895
To Grasse.

372
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:05,178
Master.

373
00:50:06,358 --> 00:50:07,332
Look.

374
00:50:12,531 --> 00:50:14,900
The very soul of the rose.

375
00:51:06,881 --> 00:51:08,529
Jean-Baptiste.

376
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:12,347
What's wrong?

377
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:15,151
Jean-Baptiste.

378
00:51:18,185 --> 00:51:20,970
- What have you done?
- You lied.

379
00:51:21,308 --> 00:51:24,412
- What?
- You lied to me.

380
00:51:25,017 --> 00:51:27,772
How dare you
talk to me like that!

381
00:51:29,181 --> 00:51:31,788
You said I could capture
the scent of anything.

382
00:51:32,561 --> 00:51:33,947
And so you can!

383
00:51:37,828 --> 00:51:39,023
What do you smell?

384
00:51:40,214 --> 00:51:41,613
What do you smell?

385
00:51:46,832 --> 00:51:47,511
Nothing.

386
00:51:50,913 --> 00:51:54,233
- What were you expecting to smell?
- Glass.

387
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:58,832
- But glass doesn't smell.
- Of course it does. What's this?

388
00:52:03,888 --> 00:52:05,403
I don't smell a thing.

389
00:52:06,225 --> 00:52:06,916
Basta!

390
00:52:06,968 --> 00:52:09,258
- Did you smell that copper?
- Enough!

391
00:52:12,233 --> 00:52:15,675
You were trying to distil
the smell of copper?

392
00:52:16,175 --> 00:52:17,011
iron...

393
00:52:17,064 --> 00:52:18,029
glass...

394
00:52:18,491 --> 00:52:19,754
copper...

395
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:24,913
What else did you try?

396
00:52:28,674 --> 00:52:29,430
No!

397
00:52:31,618 --> 00:52:33,566
Have you gone completely insane?!

398
00:52:34,511 --> 00:52:36,550
You told me I had to experiment.

399
00:52:36,825 --> 00:52:41,806
Experiment? Experiment?
With a cat?!

400
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,706
What kind of a human being are youê é?

401
00:52:47,319 --> 00:52:48,877
Don't you know anything?

402
00:52:49,204 --> 00:52:51,352
You can no more distil
the scent of a cat...

403
00:52:51,406 --> 00:52:53,811
than you can distil
the scent of you and me!

404
00:53:04,326 --> 00:53:07,105
- I can't?
- Of course not!

405
00:53:14,053 --> 00:53:15,675
He's in stadio ultimo.

406
00:53:15,729 --> 00:53:17,184
- What?
- He's dying.

407
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:18,732
Is there nothing you can do?

408
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:22,315
- I fear not.
- No! He cannot die.

409
00:53:22,372 --> 00:53:26,274
- Well, the fee is 50 francs.
- 50 francs? You're a charlatan!

410
00:53:32,012 --> 00:53:36,011
Oh dear, Jean-Baptiste!

411
00:53:37,092 --> 00:53:41,158
You cannot do this to me.
Please, don't die on me.

412
00:53:41,492 --> 00:53:43,723
Not now, not yet!

413
00:53:54,713 --> 00:53:56,905
Is there...

414
00:54:00,547 --> 00:54:02,493
any other way...

415
00:54:03,789 --> 00:54:06,608
to preserve smell
besides distil it?

416
00:54:07,007 --> 00:54:08,751
Jean-Baptiste...

417
00:54:13,517 --> 00:54:19,400
- Is there, master?
- Well, yes, I... I believe there is.

418
00:54:20,809 --> 00:54:22,689
What is ité?

419
00:54:24,445 --> 00:54:28,403
It is known as
the mysterious art of Enfleurage.

420
00:54:30,794 --> 00:54:32,408
Can you teach me?

421
00:54:35,418 --> 00:54:38,608
Not even I am intimate
with the secrets.

422
00:54:41,265 --> 00:54:43,682
But could I learn it in Grasse?

423
00:54:44,786 --> 00:54:47,535
- Well...
- Could I?

424
00:54:53,274 --> 00:54:56,429
Where else but in Grasse!

425
00:55:02,042 --> 00:55:04,350
Within a week, Grenouille was well again.

426
00:55:04,702 --> 00:55:07,364
But in order to travel to Grasse,
and find a job,

427
00:55:07,406 --> 00:55:09,966
he needed a journeyman's papers.

428
00:55:10,202 --> 00:55:12,018
Baldini agreed to provide them,

429
00:55:12,345 --> 00:55:18,052
on condition that Grenouille left him
not less than 100 formulas for new perfumes.

430
00:55:18,852 --> 00:55:22,948
Grenouille did not mind.
He could've given him a thousand.

431
00:55:28,279 --> 00:55:32,181
The morning of Grenouille's departure,
Baldini was pleased.

432
00:55:32,625 --> 00:55:36,566
At last, he felt rewarded
for his many years of hard work.

433
00:55:37,086 --> 00:55:40,171
He could not remember
a happier day.

434
00:55:40,369 --> 00:55:43,171
Deeply satisfied, he went
back to sleep...

435
00:55:43,656 --> 00:55:46,618
and awoke no more
in this life.

436
00:56:04,891 --> 00:56:09,626
With every step Grenouille took away
from the city, the happier he felt.

437
00:56:10,072 --> 00:56:14,786
The air above him grew
clearer, purer, cleaner.

438
00:56:14,916 --> 00:56:17,989
And at last, he was
able to breathe freely.

439
00:56:21,347 --> 00:56:23,936
There were two ways
to reach Grasse.

440
00:56:24,137 --> 00:56:27,649
The first followed the winding road
through the villages...

441
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:30,658
while the second lay straight across
the hills and mountains,

442
00:56:30,715 --> 00:56:32,825
down into Provence.

443
00:56:33,817 --> 00:56:36,083
The choice was quite easy.

444
00:56:39,805 --> 00:56:44,634
Thus, his nose led him ever higher,
ever further from mankind.

445
00:56:45,037 --> 00:56:50,372
Ever more towards the magnetic pole
of the greatest possible solitude.

446
00:57:27,524 --> 00:57:28,897
Grenouille needed a moment...

447
00:57:28,949 --> 00:57:31,869
to believe that he had actually
found a spot on earth...

448
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:34,724
where scent was almost absent.

449
00:57:39,725 --> 00:57:40,936
Spread all around...

450
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:44,077
lay nothing but the tranquil
scent of dead stone.

451
00:57:47,272 --> 00:57:50,350
There was something
sacred about this place.

452
00:57:53,865 --> 00:57:56,471
No longer distracted
by anything external,

453
00:57:57,194 --> 00:58:01,751
he was finally able
to bask in his own existence.

454
00:58:03,164 --> 00:58:06,362
And found it splendid!

455
00:58:13,313 --> 00:58:17,569
After a while, he almost forgot
his plans and obsessions.

456
00:58:18,894 --> 00:58:22,393
And indeed,
might've done so altogether.

457
00:58:36,773 --> 00:58:37,951
Helloá.

458
00:58:41,896 --> 00:58:43,255
Helloá.

459
00:58:45,890 --> 00:58:47,338
Helloá.

460
00:59:04,135 --> 00:59:06,865
There were a thousand smells
in his clothes.

461
00:59:06,928 --> 00:59:09,842
The smell of sand, stone, moss...

462
00:59:09,881 --> 00:59:12,412
even the smell of the sausage
he'd eaten weeks ago.

463
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:15,257
Only one smell was not there:

464
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:19,877
His own.

465
00:59:55,404 --> 00:59:57,964
For the first time in his life,
Grenouille realized...

466
00:59:58,024 --> 01:00:00,523
that he had no smell of his own.

467
01:00:01,789 --> 01:00:03,276
He realized that all his life...

468
01:00:03,352 --> 01:00:05,700
he had been a nobody
to everyone.

469
01:00:06,895 --> 01:00:10,574
What he now felt
was the fear of his own oblivion.

470
01:00:11,259 --> 01:00:12,881
It was as though...

471
01:00:13,044 --> 01:00:14,922
he did not exist.

472
01:00:20,102 --> 01:00:24,247
By the first light of next morning,
Grenouille had a new plan.

473
01:00:24,637 --> 01:00:27,450
He must continue
his journey to Grasse.

474
01:00:27,770 --> 01:00:31,167
There he would teach the world
not only that he existed...

475
01:00:31,238 --> 01:00:32,866
that he was someone...

476
01:00:33,193 --> 01:00:35,696
but that he was exceptional.

477
01:00:39,576 --> 01:00:41,226
And with this decision,

478
01:00:41,629 --> 01:00:45,732
it seemed that the gods
had at last begun to smile on him.

479
01:05:02,257 --> 01:05:03,521
Laura?

480
01:05:10,906 --> 01:05:12,141
Laura?

481
01:05:12,918 --> 01:05:14,684
Coming, papa.

482
01:05:49,775 --> 01:05:52,042
Haven't seen you here before.

483
01:05:53,523 --> 01:05:55,192
It's my first season.

484
01:05:56,621 --> 01:05:58,690
Picking together
is always more fun.

485
01:06:00,034 --> 01:06:02,177
They say you pick
everything you find.

486
01:06:44,816 --> 01:06:48,745
Idiot! How many times do I told you
not to cram the blossoms in...

487
01:06:48,781 --> 01:06:50,468
like you're stuffing a chicken?

488
01:06:51,939 --> 01:06:53,633
Watch how Grenouille does it.

489
01:06:55,606 --> 01:06:59,547
Look how skillfully he handles them.
The whole art of Enflourage...

490
01:06:59,585 --> 01:07:03,507
is to allow the flowers to die slowly,
in their sleep as it were...

491
01:07:03,834 --> 01:07:08,587
handle them as you would a lady.
Wouldn't you agree with me, Druot?

492
01:07:09,036 --> 01:07:10,810
If you say so, madame.

493
01:07:13,333 --> 01:07:15,921
You! Check the jonquil blossoms.

494
01:07:19,307 --> 01:07:20,906
It need more time.

495
01:07:23,394 --> 01:07:25,099
Do what I say.

496
01:08:07,482 --> 01:08:08,681
Stop it!

497
01:08:09,579 --> 01:08:10,914
I'm not in the mood.

498
01:08:11,333 --> 01:08:12,520
Are you sure?

499
01:08:13,485 --> 01:08:15,119
Of course I'm sure.

500
01:08:21,175 --> 01:08:22,724
I said...

501
01:08:25,272 --> 01:08:26,700
"no".

502
01:08:37,446 --> 01:08:39,103
Suit yourself.

503
01:08:42,228 --> 01:08:43,667
Lucien?

504
01:08:46,853 --> 01:08:49,629
- Fetch me by the ladder!
- Fetch it yourself!

505
01:09:01,199 --> 01:09:02,606
Lucien?

506
01:09:05,710 --> 01:09:07,122
Lucien!

507
01:09:17,554 --> 01:09:18,779
Lucien?

508
01:09:21,827 --> 01:09:23,246
Lucien?

509
01:09:41,155 --> 01:09:42,564
Lucien.

510
01:10:37,495 --> 01:10:38,528
Tuberoses.

511
01:10:38,922 --> 01:10:41,690
For Madame Arnulfi.
She hereá?

512
01:10:45,102 --> 01:10:45,939
She's busy.

513
01:10:53,548 --> 01:10:55,854
Seem such a waste to boil them!

514
01:10:56,927 --> 01:10:59,197
Or whatever you do with them.

515
01:11:03,937 --> 01:11:06,548
So, what do you do with them?

516
01:11:06,999 --> 01:11:10,717
- Warm them in animal fat.
- What for?

517
01:11:10,983 --> 01:11:13,360
The fat soaks up
their scent.

518
01:11:13,505 --> 01:11:14,751
Then what?

519
01:11:16,847 --> 01:11:20,433
Then I cool it
toward pomade, and...

520
01:11:21,045 --> 01:11:24,694
and then I filter it, before...

521
01:11:28,578 --> 01:11:29,844
Before what?

522
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:33,190
Before adding alcohol and other essences
to make perfume.

523
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:35,422
Don't touch anything!

524
01:11:40,648 --> 01:11:41,751
What's in there?

525
01:11:43,256 --> 01:11:44,754
Nothing, just flowers.

526
01:11:45,272 --> 01:11:46,442
- Can I look?
- No.

527
01:11:47,054 --> 01:11:49,284
Not now, I've got work to do.
You must go now.

528
01:11:49,309 --> 01:11:52,032
- Ah, come on, let me look.
- Don't touch!

529
01:11:54,981 --> 01:11:57,353
- Morning, madame.
- Morning.

530
01:12:00,686 --> 01:12:03,197
Why do you cover the tank?

531
01:12:04,289 --> 01:12:07,167
It's an experiment, madame, to...

532
01:12:07,568 --> 01:12:11,055
to... protect the blossoms
from daylight,

533
01:12:11,315 --> 01:12:13,091
to preserve the scent better.

534
01:12:14,237 --> 01:12:16,337
Well, if you say so.

535
01:12:17,745 --> 01:12:21,296
Come with me.
I'll settle your master's account.

536
01:12:23,286 --> 01:12:25,705
To preserve their scent better, you say?

537
01:12:39,426 --> 01:12:40,913
I don't smell much.

538
01:12:46,991 --> 01:12:50,954
No. Then my experiment
was a failure.

539
01:12:54,132 --> 01:12:57,224
Make sure it's your time
you're wasting, not ours.

540
01:13:09,356 --> 01:13:11,047
How much must I pay?

541
01:13:13,135 --> 01:13:14,839
To be with youê.

542
01:13:15,407 --> 01:13:17,003
Depends what you want.

543
01:13:30,764 --> 01:13:32,157
What's that stuff?

544
01:13:35,287 --> 01:13:37,061
I'm creating a perfume.

545
01:13:40,132 --> 01:13:41,434
Lie down, please.

546
01:14:00,537 --> 01:14:01,909
They feels horrible.

547
01:14:03,071 --> 01:14:06,620
It's only animal fat.
To soak up your scent.

548
01:14:07,475 --> 01:14:09,750
Creating a perfume, mate?

549
01:14:09,929 --> 01:14:10,802
Come on, admit it.

550
01:14:10,886 --> 01:14:13,213
You're getting some sorta
bang out of this, aren't you?

551
01:14:13,866 --> 01:14:15,199
Aren't you?

552
01:14:16,023 --> 01:14:17,865
I enjoy my work.

553
01:14:19,386 --> 01:14:21,106
Keep your arm still.

554
01:14:28,434 --> 01:14:30,155
Don't think you're
gonna tie me up.

555
01:14:31,337 --> 01:14:33,225
Hold out your arm, please.

556
01:14:40,968 --> 01:14:42,870
I've come across
some strange men in my time...

557
01:14:42,873 --> 01:14:46,246
Just... relax!

558
01:14:53,175 --> 01:14:55,190
Holy Mother! What's that?

559
01:14:58,153 --> 01:15:00,878
- Just scraping off the fat.
- Are you mad?

560
01:15:00,935 --> 01:15:03,853
I said relax!
You'll ruin everything.

561
01:15:04,425 --> 01:15:08,109
Your frighten just stink,
your perfume will be spoiled.

562
01:15:08,251 --> 01:15:09,419
I've had enough!

563
01:15:10,679 --> 01:15:13,526
Get out!
Here, take your money!

564
01:15:14,133 --> 01:15:17,177
Baste me with all these goo.
What do you think I am? A Christmas goose?

565
01:15:17,624 --> 01:15:19,183
Get out of here!

566
01:18:37,124 --> 01:18:39,996
Quickly! Blow them out
before the roses melt.

567
01:18:40,487 --> 01:18:42,678
- Roses can't melt, papa.
- These ones can.

568
01:18:57,189 --> 01:19:00,929
Now I'd like to propose a toast
to our guest of honor...

569
01:19:01,684 --> 01:19:03,838
His Excellency, the Marquis de Montesquieu.

570
01:19:04,469 --> 01:19:06,789
May our trade continue to flourish!

571
01:19:12,091 --> 01:19:13,793
I thank you all...

572
01:19:14,058 --> 01:19:16,624
and will ask of you the honor
to be the first to...

573
01:19:16,811 --> 01:19:19,064
offer my congratulations
to your beautiful daughter.

574
01:19:19,284 --> 01:19:21,978
And present her with
a small token of my affection.

575
01:19:46,984 --> 01:19:50,252
- I'm overwhelmed, Your Grace.
- Your Grace?

576
01:19:51,264 --> 01:19:54,008
I had hoped that it would be
on more familiar terms by now.

577
01:19:57,498 --> 01:20:01,441
- Let's have a game of hide-and-seek!
- Oh, yes! But everyone must play.

578
01:20:04,202 --> 01:20:05,750
Men catch the women.

579
01:20:07,938 --> 01:20:09,818
Bravo! Bravo!

580
01:20:12,825 --> 01:20:14,525
Albine, wait!

581
01:20:47,112 --> 01:20:48,154
No!

582
01:21:40,463 --> 01:21:42,841
Put me down, please!

583
01:21:47,454 --> 01:21:49,231
Now there's no escape.

584
01:22:18,025 --> 01:22:19,870
Game's over, everybody!

585
01:22:22,438 --> 01:22:23,341
Laura!

586
01:22:25,138 --> 01:22:27,039
Time to go in now!

587
01:22:49,916 --> 01:22:51,271
Laura.

588
01:23:08,691 --> 01:23:11,116
Albine! Fran?oise!

589
01:23:16,690 --> 01:23:19,111
Laura, have you seen the twins?

590
01:23:19,501 --> 01:23:21,502
No, not since the game started.

591
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:25,925
Albine. Fran?oise.

592
01:23:36,597 --> 01:23:41,820
- Albine! Fran?oise!
- Jacques, take this way.

593
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:44,031
You two, go with me.

594
01:23:44,164 --> 01:23:48,043
Your Excellency, through here.

595
01:25:03,211 --> 01:25:05,956
I've told that cretin ten times
to get these ready.

596
01:25:06,574 --> 01:25:08,068
Don't keep picking on the boy.

597
01:25:09,118 --> 01:25:11,818
I'll kill the useless little sewer rat!

598
01:25:12,232 --> 01:25:15,414
Grenouille! What are you doing?

599
01:25:15,982 --> 01:25:18,136
Why aren't the enfleurage frames...

600
01:25:24,861 --> 01:25:26,719
- Yes, master?
- I mean...

601
01:25:26,755 --> 01:25:30,428
would you be good enough to prepare
the enfleurage frames, Jean-Baptiste?

602
01:25:33,815 --> 01:25:35,781
Certainly, master.

603
01:25:45,675 --> 01:25:46,736
Hey, look!

604
01:25:48,436 --> 01:25:50,742
Sweet... There!

605
01:25:51,048 --> 01:25:53,547
A curfew? Are you mad?

606
01:25:53,879 --> 01:25:56,669
Jasmine can only be picked
before dawn. We all know that!

607
01:25:57,015 --> 01:25:59,883
This could mean the ruin
of our trade!

608
01:26:00,114 --> 01:26:03,079
Yours! And yours, and yours!

609
01:26:04,420 --> 01:26:06,619
Supposing it's your daughter
next time?

610
01:26:08,351 --> 01:26:10,707
Of course, a curfew is necessary.

611
01:26:10,799 --> 01:26:12,083
But we also have to catch this man.

612
01:26:12,134 --> 01:26:14,733
And the only way to do that
is to understand how he thinks!

613
01:26:15,190 --> 01:26:18,122
- What he wants!
- I should've thought that was obvious.

614
01:26:18,515 --> 01:26:20,255
Use your imagination!

615
01:26:20,308 --> 01:26:22,466
And if I were to tell you
that all except the prostitute...

616
01:26:22,551 --> 01:26:25,336
went to their graves
with their chastity intact?

617
01:26:26,115 --> 01:26:29,227
- How would you know?
- The coroner had each girl examined.

618
01:26:29,493 --> 01:26:31,245
They were all found
to be virgins.

619
01:26:33,332 --> 01:26:35,779
Supposing there isn't
a next time...

620
01:26:35,874 --> 01:26:39,789
if we introduce a curfew,
we may all go bankrupt for nothing.

621
01:26:41,909 --> 01:26:46,145
So we wait until he's killed what...
Six? Seven? Eight?

622
01:27:10,650 --> 01:27:12,828
Curfew! Go back to your homes!

623
01:27:14,106 --> 01:27:16,219
- What's happening?
- It's a curfew. Back to your home.

624
01:27:27,741 --> 01:27:30,099
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!

625
01:27:30,869 --> 01:27:34,631
We have to face the fact
that our police are helpless in this matter.

626
01:27:34,973 --> 01:27:39,555
- I suggest that we ask for support from Paris.
- Paris won't be smarter than we are.

627
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:43,805
Arrest every Gypsy and beggar!
And every man without a wife and family!

628
01:27:43,891 --> 01:27:45,482
Listen!

629
01:27:47,244 --> 01:27:50,699
We have to put ourselves
inside the mind of this man.

630
01:27:51,589 --> 01:27:55,740
Each of his victims
had an especial beauty.

631
01:27:56,365 --> 01:27:57,765
We know he doesn't want
their virginity.

632
01:27:57,856 --> 01:28:00,875
So, it seems to me
that it's that beauty itself...

633
01:28:00,939 --> 01:28:02,847
that he wants. It's almost as if...

634
01:28:02,888 --> 01:28:04,944
as if he's trying
to gather something.

635
01:28:05,851 --> 01:28:08,381
His ambitions of those
of a collector.

636
01:28:09,869 --> 01:28:13,786
- A collector of what?
- Their hair?

637
01:28:14,081 --> 01:28:15,520
Get out! Get out!

638
01:28:20,469 --> 01:28:21,880
Whatever it is...

639
01:28:22,633 --> 01:28:27,917
I fear he won't stop killing
until his collection is complete.

640
01:28:47,458 --> 01:28:48,747
Here you are! Next!

641
01:28:51,194 --> 01:28:51,847
You too!

642
01:28:51,914 --> 01:28:52,549
Monsieur?

643
01:28:55,830 --> 01:28:58,186
This man... this man is a demon!

644
01:28:58,899 --> 01:29:01,997
A phantom who cannot be fought
by human means!

645
01:29:02,489 --> 01:29:07,340
Now I insist that we call upon
our bishop to excommunicate him!

646
01:29:07,542 --> 01:29:10,008
What good would that do?

647
01:29:10,213 --> 01:29:13,477
Have you no faith in the power
of our Holy Mother Church?

648
01:29:14,971 --> 01:29:18,423
It's not a matter of faith!
There's a murderer out there!

649
01:29:18,435 --> 01:29:21,238
And we must catch him
by using our God-given wits.

650
01:29:22,525 --> 01:29:24,866
I say, until we submit him
to our church...

651
01:29:25,889 --> 01:29:27,968
these killings will not cease.

652
01:29:43,969 --> 01:29:45,615
Citizens of Grasse...

653
01:29:45,807 --> 01:29:48,533
we hereby declare
that this murderer...

654
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:51,829
is demon in our midst.

655
01:29:51,965 --> 01:29:55,590
Has incurred the sentence
of excommunication!

656
01:29:57,480 --> 01:30:02,724
Not only has this depraved monster
robbed us of our daughters...

657
01:30:02,821 --> 01:30:06,467
the young and fair
blossom of the city...

658
01:30:06,771 --> 01:30:10,414
and by his wanton acts,
has brought our trade...

659
01:30:10,459 --> 01:30:14,884
our livelihood,
our very existence...

660
01:30:15,144 --> 01:30:18,363
to the brink
of eternal darkness!

661
01:30:19,958 --> 01:30:24,050
We therefore declare,
that this vile viper...

662
01:30:24,397 --> 01:30:30,291
this ignominious carbuncle,
this extricable evil in our midsts...

663
01:30:30,934 --> 01:30:35,647
shall henceforth be solemnly
banned from our Holy Presence...

664
01:30:36,261 --> 01:30:40,527
rejected from the Communion
of Holy Mother Church...

665
01:30:40,833 --> 01:30:43,377
as a disciple of Satan.

666
01:30:44,308 --> 01:30:46,159
Slayer of souls...

667
01:30:46,219 --> 01:30:48,287
Stand clear! Stand clear!

668
01:30:50,318 --> 01:30:52,074
outsider of the faith...

669
01:30:52,650 --> 01:30:56,567
a necromancer, a diabolist,
a sorcerer...

670
01:30:56,813 --> 01:30:58,966
a damned heretic!

671
01:31:00,479 --> 01:31:03,579
Oh, God! In thy most
merciful spirit,

672
01:31:04,898 --> 01:31:07,808
bring down thunderbolts
upon his head!

673
01:31:08,490 --> 01:31:13,240
And may the Devil make stope
of his bones! Amen!

674
01:31:13,326 --> 01:31:15,744
My Lord! My Lord!

675
01:31:16,309 --> 01:31:17,709
It's a miracle!

676
01:31:17,858 --> 01:31:19,764
He's been caught! He's been caught!

677
01:31:21,616 --> 01:31:23,883
My Lord, the fiend
has been caught.

678
01:31:25,169 --> 01:31:27,850
In the city of Grenoble.
He's confessed to everything.

679
01:31:28,947 --> 01:31:30,534
He's confessed to everything!

680
01:31:32,938 --> 01:31:36,317
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

681
01:31:37,285 --> 01:31:42,495
Thanks be to God. And we thank him
for listening to our prayers...

682
01:31:42,926 --> 01:31:47,809
and answering them. Amen!

683
01:31:48,145 --> 01:31:52,674
Amen! Amen!

684
01:32:06,036 --> 01:32:09,285
Just read the report. This cannot
possibly be the same man.

685
01:32:12,632 --> 01:32:16,934
He confessed to everything,
including the murders in Grasse.

686
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,496
Yes, and the torture.

687
01:32:20,644 --> 01:32:22,031
Look, here!

688
01:32:22,768 --> 01:32:25,048
He admits to strangling his victims...

689
01:32:25,407 --> 01:32:27,924
pulling out their hair,
and ravaging them.

690
01:32:27,992 --> 01:32:31,005
The girls of Grasse were killed
by a single blow to the back of their heads.

691
01:32:31,033 --> 01:32:34,215
Their hair was carefully cropped.
And not one of them was violated.

692
01:32:34,562 --> 01:32:36,121
Antoine...

693
01:32:36,839 --> 01:32:38,691
we're all happy it's over.

694
01:32:39,832 --> 01:32:41,271
Let it go.

695
01:33:26,734 --> 01:33:29,674
- Papa, what's the matter?
- We're going home, now!

696
01:33:29,857 --> 01:33:32,010
- But why? I'm enjoying myself!
- Don't argue with me!

697
01:33:32,274 --> 01:33:33,227
Stop it! I'm grown-up...

698
01:33:41,605 --> 01:33:43,206
Laura!

699
01:33:44,036 --> 01:33:45,414
Laura!

700
01:33:48,286 --> 01:33:49,438
Out of my way!

701
01:33:50,108 --> 01:33:51,095
Laura!

702
01:34:45,750 --> 01:34:48,645
- Laura!
- Papa!

703
01:34:54,563 --> 01:34:56,564
I'm so sorry.

704
01:35:09,121 --> 01:35:11,978
I know you must think me
a very foolish man.

705
01:35:13,152 --> 01:35:15,002
But try to understand.

706
01:35:16,060 --> 01:35:19,427
- You're all I have left.
- You don't need to explain, papa.

707
01:35:19,471 --> 01:35:22,413
- If anything would happen to you...
- I know.

708
01:35:22,988 --> 01:35:25,335
But you must stop worrying
about me all the time.

709
01:35:45,848 --> 01:35:47,228
Sweet dreams, my love.

710
01:35:51,224 --> 01:35:52,668
Sweet dreams, papa.

711
01:36:50,609 --> 01:36:52,147
Laura!

712
01:37:01,891 --> 01:37:04,146
Papa, what's the matter?

713
01:37:08,830 --> 01:37:10,092
Did you open the window?

714
01:37:12,248 --> 01:37:14,453
No. Why?

715
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:21,072
Have this letter dispatched to
the Marquis de Montesquieu immediately.

716
01:37:21,978 --> 01:37:23,489
Marie, quickly!

717
01:38:08,564 --> 01:38:10,472
Stay on the road north,
into the mountains.

718
01:38:28,223 --> 01:38:30,533
- Did Monsieur Richis leave?
- He did.

719
01:38:31,065 --> 01:38:32,146
Which way?

720
01:38:33,158 --> 01:38:34,597
North.

721
01:38:40,726 --> 01:38:43,865
- You sure it wasn't south?
- I saw them with my own eyes!

722
01:38:44,243 --> 01:38:45,716
What do you want to know?

723
01:38:47,509 --> 01:38:50,312
I said north, north!

724
01:38:52,388 --> 01:38:53,673
Grenouille?

725
01:38:55,712 --> 01:38:57,032
Grenouille!

726
01:38:59,370 --> 01:39:00,658
Grenouille!

727
01:39:10,638 --> 01:39:11,985
Grenouille!

728
01:39:27,338 --> 01:39:28,790
Good God!

729
01:40:23,621 --> 01:40:25,399
- Good afternoon, monsieur.
- Good afternoon.

730
01:40:25,446 --> 01:40:27,066
Do you have anyone
else staying here?

731
01:40:28,402 --> 01:40:29,338
No, monsieur.

732
01:40:29,534 --> 01:40:31,934
Then I would like to take
all your rooms for the night.

733
01:40:31,999 --> 01:40:33,886
It will be a pleasure, monsieur.

734
01:40:35,738 --> 01:40:39,106
And tomorrow, first light,
we wish to be ferried to the Iles de L¨¦rins.

735
01:40:39,717 --> 01:40:42,249
- It's deserted except for a few...
- I'm aware of that.

736
01:40:44,033 --> 01:40:44,948
Very well, monsieur.

737
01:40:49,424 --> 01:40:51,253
Our finest room, mademoiselle.

738
01:40:53,952 --> 01:40:55,917
With the superb view of the sea.

739
01:40:56,719 --> 01:40:57,600
One moment.

740
01:41:04,027 --> 01:41:05,058
Very well.

741
01:41:06,146 --> 01:41:10,651
- Do you have a room next to this?
- Yes, but the view cannot be compared to...

742
01:41:10,930 --> 01:41:12,858
There have no interest
in the view.

743
01:41:29,137 --> 01:41:32,127
Oh, my God...

744
01:41:55,619 --> 01:41:56,520
Monsieur.

745
01:42:04,074 --> 01:42:07,957
Papa, will you please
tell me now what's happening.

746
01:42:08,656 --> 01:42:09,977
You haven't said a word all day.

747
01:42:10,924 --> 01:42:12,548
Why all the secrecy?

748
01:42:16,778 --> 01:42:18,682
Last night, I dreamt
you were dead...

749
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:22,823
murdered
like all the other girls.

750
01:42:31,237 --> 01:42:34,534
The truth is I'm convinced that
the killer is still here somewhere.

751
01:42:36,249 --> 01:42:40,315
All of his victims were young and beautiful,
and who is there more beautiful than you, Laura?

752
01:42:42,420 --> 01:42:47,318
Whatever his insane scheme,
it will surely be incomplete without you.

753
01:42:55,392 --> 01:42:58,538
I've written to the Marquis accepting
his proposal and marriage on your behalf,

754
01:42:58,597 --> 01:43:01,744
and requesting that it take place
as soon as possible.

755
01:43:02,942 --> 01:43:05,876
Until then, you stay
in the safety of the monastery.

756
01:43:07,576 --> 01:43:12,111
- And all this, because you had a bad dream?
- I've made my decision.

757
01:43:12,224 --> 01:43:16,306
- But I don't know whether I even love him!
- I'm afraid the circumstances leave us no choice.

758
01:43:16,384 --> 01:43:18,975
- Papa!
- It's all arranged, Laura.

759
01:48:54,606 --> 01:48:55,644
On your feet!

760
01:48:56,188 --> 01:48:57,185
Hands in the air!

761
01:49:41,282 --> 01:49:43,779
Why did you kill my daughter?

762
01:49:47,732 --> 01:49:48,783
Why?

763
01:49:51,958 --> 01:49:53,389
I needed her.

764
01:50:18,678 --> 01:50:20,917
Why did you kill my daughter?

765
01:50:25,185 --> 01:50:26,741
I just...

766
01:50:29,353 --> 01:50:30,823
needed her.

767
01:50:38,288 --> 01:50:39,551
Very well.

768
01:50:41,666 --> 01:50:43,895
But you remember this:

769
01:50:50,209 --> 01:50:52,030
I'll be looking at you...

770
01:50:54,575 --> 01:50:56,087
when you're laid on the cross,

771
01:50:56,150 --> 01:51:00,638
and the twelve blows are
crashing down on your limbs.

772
01:51:02,773 --> 01:51:08,175
When the crowd is finally tired
of your screams and wandered home...

773
01:51:09,346 --> 01:51:13,469
I will climb up
through your blood...

774
01:51:15,233 --> 01:51:17,413
and sit beside you.

775
01:51:18,992 --> 01:51:22,438
I will look deep
into your eyes...

776
01:51:23,431 --> 01:51:26,479
and drop by drop...

777
01:51:28,348 --> 01:51:32,192
I will trickle my digust into them...

778
01:51:33,864 --> 01:51:36,721
like burning acid...

779
01:51:38,467 --> 01:51:39,870
until...

780
01:51:43,250 --> 01:51:44,706
finally...

781
01:51:48,193 --> 01:51:50,226
you perish.

782
01:52:24,119 --> 01:52:25,642
What do you think
they'll do to him?

783
01:52:25,922 --> 01:52:29,650
Apparently, they're gonna break
every bone in his body with an iron bar.

784
01:52:42,482 --> 01:52:43,856
Look, there he comes!

785
01:53:45,149 --> 01:53:46,648
Unchain the prisoner.

786
01:53:57,645 --> 01:53:59,174
That's enough.

787
01:54:00,599 --> 01:54:02,520
Let him be brought
to the scaffold.

788
01:54:07,419 --> 01:54:08,347
What's that?

789
01:55:19,386 --> 01:55:21,104
Is he coming? What's his name?

790
01:57:06,659 --> 01:57:09,586
This man is innocent.

791
01:57:13,323 --> 01:57:16,026
- He didn't do it. It's impossible!
- He's innocent!

792
01:57:20,286 --> 01:57:21,513
He's innocent!

793
01:58:38,453 --> 01:58:42,635
This is no man!
This is an angel!

794
02:04:35,931 --> 02:04:38,147
You can't fool me!

795
02:05:24,946 --> 02:05:26,479
Forgive me!

796
02:05:32,869 --> 02:05:34,946
My son!

797
02:06:34,944 --> 02:06:38,769
People of Grasse
awoke to a terrible hangover.

798
02:06:40,034 --> 02:06:45,048
For many of them, the experience
was so gustly, so completely inexplicable...

799
02:06:45,080 --> 02:06:51,013
and incompatible with their morals,
that they literally erased it from their memories.

800
02:06:51,632 --> 02:06:54,505
The town council
was in session by the afternoon.

801
02:06:54,624 --> 02:07:00,527
And an order was passed to the police lieutenant
to immediately begin fresh investigations into the murders.

802
02:07:01,628 --> 02:07:04,536
The following day, Dominique Druot
was arrested.

803
02:07:04,619 --> 02:07:09,189
Since it was in his backyard that the clothes
and hair of all the victims had been found.

804
02:07:10,164 --> 02:07:13,452
After fourteen hours of torture,
Druot confessed to everything.

805
02:07:16,170 --> 02:07:18,723
With that, the case was closed.

806
02:07:22,911 --> 02:07:26,587
By then, Grenouille was already
halfway back to Paris.

807
02:07:30,404 --> 02:07:34,566
He still had enough perfume left
to enslave the whole world, if he so chose.

808
02:07:35,249 --> 02:07:38,357
He could walk to Versailles,
and have the King kiss his feet.

809
02:07:38,762 --> 02:07:43,113
He could write the Pope a perfumed letter,
and reveal himself as a new Messiah.

810
02:07:43,900 --> 02:07:46,834
He could do all this,
and more if he wanted to.

811
02:07:47,529 --> 02:07:51,976
He possessed a power stronger
than the power of money, or terror, or death.

812
02:07:52,734 --> 02:07:56,446
The invincible power
to command the love of mankind.

813
02:08:02,932 --> 02:08:05,703
There was only one thing
the perfume could not do.

814
02:08:06,084 --> 02:08:11,243
It could not turn him into a person
who could love and be loved like everyone else.

815
02:08:12,426 --> 02:08:16,178
So, to hell with it, he thought.
To hell with the world.

816
02:08:16,654 --> 02:08:19,556
With the perfume, with himself.

817
02:08:22,237 --> 02:08:27,306
On the 25th of June, 1766,
around 11 o'clock at night,

818
02:08:27,533 --> 02:08:30,618
Grenouille entered the city
through the port-de-Leones.

819
02:08:31,150 --> 02:08:37,865
And like a sleepwalker, his olfactory memories
drew him back to the place where he was born.

820
02:09:56,693 --> 02:09:59,410
An angel!

821
02:10:00,792 --> 02:10:02,697
I love you!

822
02:10:48,049 --> 02:10:53,545
Within no time, Jean-Baptiste Grenouille
had disappeared from the face of the earth.

823
02:10:54,546 --> 02:10:59,186
When they had finished,
they felt a virginal glow of happiness.

824
02:10:59,873 --> 02:11:04,951
For the first time in their lives,
they believed that they had done something...

825
02:11:05,185 --> 02:11:08,412
purely out of love.

826
02:11:37,900 --> 02:11:39,866
Hey, over here!

827
02:11:40,431 --> 02:11:41,385
Look!

828
02:11:48,407 --> 02:11:49,645
Let's take them away.

829
02:11:50,425 --> 02:11:51,537
You could wear them.

830
02:12:00,425 --> 02:12:30,537
