1
00:00:46,785 --> 00:00:50,285
<i>I say unto you, that one
of you will betray me.</i>

2
00:00:59,086 --> 00:01:03,286
<i>The one who has dipped his hands in
the bowl, will have betrayed me.</i>

3
00:01:04,487 --> 00:01:08,587
<i>Take this, and eat it;
this is my body.</i>

4
00:01:14,488 --> 00:01:16,088
What are you doing out here?

5
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:18,589
He's at it again.

6
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:24,090
<i>Now that I, your Lord and
Teacher, have washed your feet</i>

7
00:01:24,491 --> 00:01:27,291
<i>you also should wash
one another's feet.</i>

8
00:01:35,292 --> 00:01:37,992
I want you to go
hide in the cellar.

9
00:01:37,993 --> 00:01:41,293
And wait for me. I'm gonna
come get you, okay?

10
00:01:41,794 --> 00:01:42,894
Yes, Mom.

11
00:01:45,595 --> 00:01:46,895
Go, go.

12
00:02:21,398 --> 00:02:25,398
<i>Breaking news: A meteorite has struck
just outside Rochester, New York,</i>

13
00:02:25,399 --> 00:02:27,299
<i>killing over 230 people,</i>

14

<i>exposing 75 residents to an
unknown form of radioactivity.</i>

15

<i>At around 10:00 pm,
residents of Rochester, New York,</i>

16
00:02:36,402 --> 00:02:40,802
<i>were awestruck when the calm sky was
cracked open by a massive fire ball.</i>

17
00:02:42,303 --> 00:02:44,683
<i>The meteorite's impact
sent debris flying over</i>

18
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:47,829
<i>16,000 meters away from
the crater epicenter.</i>

19
00:02:48,805 --> 00:02:51,060
<i>The U.S. army has
quarantined residents</i>

20

<i>within a ten mile radius
of the meteorite.</i>

21
00:02:56,307 --> 00:03:00,107
<i>A year has passed, however
meteorologists are still baffled</i>

22
00:03:00,108 --> 00:03:04,708
<i>by the extreme increase in weather within
a ten mile radius of the crash site.</i>

23
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:10,709
<i>Eighteen months later, and only
13 out of the 75 residents</i>

24
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:13,709
<i>who were exposed to the massive
radiation, have survived.</i>

25
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:17,110
<i>They have been nicknamed
"The Rochester 13."</i>

<i>Scientists studying the
"Rochester Thirteen"</i>

<i>their own form of

29
00:03:31,213 --> 00:03:34,513
<i>The Bureau of Investigation is speculating

<i>of serial killer "Ringmaster Jesus"</i>

31

<i>whose real name is Kevin Sherwood.</i>

32
00:03:42,516 --> 00:03:44,816
<i>Kevin Sherwood,
an evangelical preacher,</i>

33
00:03:44,817 --> 00:03:49,617
<i>who authorities believe killed over
45 people in a four year period.</i>

34
00:03:52,218 --> 00:03:54,718
<i>The Bureau has released the
startling information tonight</i>

35
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:59,619
<i>that the serial killer Kevin Sherwood,
was in fact one of "The Roschester 13."</i>

36
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,320
<i>A suicide note was found,</i>

37
00:04:01,321 --> 00:04:03,421
<i>which experts have
confirmed is authentic.</i>

38
00:04:03,422 --> 00:04:08,022
<i>In the letter Sherwood referenced the
meteorite as a sign to do God's work.</i>

39
00:04:46,425 --> 00:04:49,025
<i>A search continues
tonight for Ian Sparks</i>

40
00:04:49,026 --> 00:04:52,926
<i>who authorities have identified
as the "Matanza copy-cat killer."</i>

41
00:05:16,027 --> 00:05:17,827
I want to report...

42
00:05:18,428 --> 00:05:20,128
.. my murder.

43
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:24,729
I've found him.

44
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,130
He's here.

45
00:05:34,932 --> 00:05:38,632
Every cop and "Super" in the City
is looking for you, Sparks.

46
00:05:39,033 --> 00:05:41,033
Who should I call first?

47
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,634
Wanna hear me out first, pal?

48
00:05:45,935 --> 00:05:48,335
Then you can call whoever you want.

49
00:05:52,236 --> 00:05:53,336
Docherty,

50
00:05:53,337 --> 00:05:54,337
Recorder.

51
00:05:54,337 --> 00:05:55,237
Now!

52
00:06:04,538 --> 00:06:06,038
Smoke?

53
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:22,239
Ya got a lot of tape in there?

54
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,440
Because I got a lot of story.

55
00:06:29,241 --> 00:06:32,441
I was six years old when
my calling discovered me.

56
00:06:32,842 --> 00:06:36,842
"Hurry space cadets to bring justice
and peace to the whole galaxy."

57
00:07:30,943 --> 00:07:33,643
<i>I believed it was my
fate to protect others.</i>

58
00:07:34,444 --> 00:07:37,844
<i>Proof right there that I was
a moron at an early age.</i>

59
00:07:45,645 --> 00:07:50,645
<i>I figured if the police couldn't
stop the scum I'd do it myself.</i>

60
00:07:53,246 --> 00:07:57,246
<i>When I turned fifteen, I celebrated
my birthday by cleansing my hometown.</i>

61
00:07:57,547 --> 00:07:58,447
OK.

62
00:07:59,648 --> 00:08:01,248
Is this what you wanted?

63
00:08:01,549 --> 00:08:03,549
- Yeah.
- Good.

64
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:07,750
<i>I made short work of all the thugs,
gangs and bindlestiffs.</i>

65
00:08:13,151 --> 00:08:16,551
<i>The only thing that came easy
for me as a "Super" was my name.</i>

66
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:34,252
<i>At the time, "Supers" were just starting
to populate cities across the country.</i>

67
00:08:36,253 --> 00:08:38,453
It was the only job I ever wanted.

68
00:08:39,254 --> 00:08:41,854
Ian, do you know how
hard I worked on this?

69
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,955
You're playing too rough out there.

70
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:45,556
Sorry Ma'am.

71
00:08:47,957 --> 00:08:51,157
- I'll make some extras.
- Thank you ma'am.

72
00:08:52,558 --> 00:08:55,358
<i>By the time I was 21
My plan was simple.</i>

73
00:08:55,359 --> 00:08:58,359
<i>Move to the big leagues
and join the other "Supers."</i>

74
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,660
I'm gonna miss you so much.

75
00:09:04,661 --> 00:09:06,361
My sweet boy.

76
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:16,962
You know, life hasn't always
dealt you the best hand.

77
00:09:18,163 --> 00:09:20,963
But I think things
are gonna change.

78
00:09:20,964 --> 00:09:25,964
Now, go be the Spark
that the city needs.

79
00:09:31,565 --> 00:09:33,165
<i>I found out right away,</i>

80
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:36,766
<i>that city thugs weren't like
the old neighborhood bad boys.</i>

81
00:09:38,867 --> 00:09:41,767
<i>I got my teeth kicked
in more times than not.</i>

82
00:09:43,568 --> 00:09:45,768
Just when I thought I had an edge,

83
00:09:46,369 --> 00:09:48,769
<i>I learned the other
guy was packing too.</i>

84
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,770
<i>I've always been a quick healer</i>

85
00:09:51,771 --> 00:09:55,771
<i>but it became clear to me, that, if I
wanted to have any longevity as a "Super,"</i>

86
00:09:55,772 --> 00:09:57,472
<i>I'd need some backup.</i>

87
00:10:03,473 --> 00:10:05,873
<i>As fate would have it, that night,</i>

88
00:10:05,874 --> 00:10:08,174
<i>the cops raided a
shipment at the docks.</i>

89
00:10:08,175 --> 00:10:10,975
Come on, calm down,
stop where you are.

90
00:10:18,376 --> 00:10:19,376
Duck!

91
00:10:24,377 --> 00:10:25,777
There she was.

92
00:10:28,278 --> 00:10:30,178
<i>Amongst all this violence,</i>

93
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,579
<i>I found a little piece of Heaven.</i>

94
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,580
<i>Power</i>

95
00:10:44,281 --> 00:10:45,281
<i>Beauty</i>

96
00:10:45,282 --> 00:10:47,682
<i>And one hell of a back kick.</i>

97
00:10:49,283 --> 00:10:51,483
<i>She was the type of
woman whose first name</i>

98
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,184
<i>you instantly wanted
to add to your last.</i>

99
00:10:57,985 --> 00:10:58,985
Excuse me?

100
00:10:58,986 --> 00:11:00,186
Lady

101
00:11:01,988 --> 00:11:03,788
Thanks for...

102
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:05,989
for saving my life... back there.

103
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:07,690
Sure.

104
00:11:07,891 --> 00:11:10,091
All in a day's work.

105
00:11:10,992 --> 00:11:13,692
Hey. Where's that brick wall
you call your partner?

106
00:11:15,693 --> 00:11:16,893
Sledge.

107
00:11:18,494 --> 00:11:20,894
Just Sledge? Not...

108
00:11:21,195 --> 00:11:24,195
..."My steady Sledge" or
"My fiance Sledge"?

109
00:11:27,496 --> 00:11:29,096
Just Sledge.

110
00:11:30,397 --> 00:11:31,597
That's good.

111
00:11:32,598 --> 00:11:34,898
I didn't get your name.

112
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:36,699
Sparks.

113
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,500
Catchy.

114
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:43,201
Thanks.

115
00:11:46,002 --> 00:11:48,802
Suppose I told you I was
looking for a partner.

116
00:11:49,803 --> 00:11:52,003
Suppose I believe you.

117
00:11:52,704 --> 00:11:55,304
Suppose I was hoping it was you.

118
00:12:00,105 --> 00:12:02,105
Well, keep hoping,

119
00:12:03,206 --> 00:12:04,506
You never know.

120
00:12:15,107 --> 00:12:17,807
<i>And from then on, we were a team.</i>

121
00:12:19,608 --> 00:12:22,608
<i>She had the moxie to
take on the big boys,</i>

122
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:24,609
<i>and I handled the leftovers.</i>

123
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,910
<i>But more importantly,</i>

124
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:36,611
I finally got what
<i> Nat King Cole was singing about.</i>

125
00:12:48,412 --> 00:12:50,612
<i>It was a magical time.</i>

126
00:12:56,413 --> 00:12:58,613
<i>But reality would soon screw it up.</i>

127
00:12:58,714 --> 00:13:01,614
Matanza! Matanza!

128
00:14:19,915 --> 00:14:21,315
Heavenly!

129
00:15:07,917 --> 00:15:08,617
<i>I</i>

130
00:15:08,618 --> 00:15:09,518
<i>AM</i>

131
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,619
<i>MATANZA</i> ('slaughter')

132
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:17,420
<i>Matanza announced his arrival to the city
by killing eleven people that night.</i>

133
00:15:17,821 --> 00:15:19,821
<i>And capturing it all on film.</i>

134
00:15:20,322 --> 00:15:22,922
<i>Not since the serial
killer "Ringmaster Jesus"</i>

135
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:25,723
<i>has one man held the city hostage.</i>

136
00:15:35,124 --> 00:15:39,724
<i>For the next year, Heavenly and I
tracked Matanza's bloody trail.</i>

137
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,225
<i>All officers, report
to fourth and Broadway</i>

138

<i>suspect is held up at the
Refinery brewing company.</i>

139
00:15:51,427 --> 00:15:53,427
Relax, sledge, it
ain't gonna happen.

140
00:15:56,429 --> 00:15:58,629
We've got this Sledge, thanks.

141
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,630
Oh, you got it handled?

142
00:16:02,031 --> 00:16:04,731
Hey hey, don't worry, I'm
gonna personally back 'em.

143
00:16:10,332 --> 00:16:13,532
I could swear I just heard a siren.

144
00:16:16,533 --> 00:16:18,733
We believe we have the
perp hiding on the roof.

145
00:16:19,334 --> 00:16:20,734
Thank you officer.

146
00:16:23,435 --> 00:16:24,835
Good luck Sparks.

147
00:17:02,036 --> 00:17:04,536
Happy one year
anniversary Sweetheart.

148
00:17:10,837 --> 00:17:12,437
Will you be my wife?

149
00:17:14,438 --> 00:17:15,538
Ian!

150
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:28,539
Was that a yes?

151
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,540
Yes!

152
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:50,641
Heaven!

153
00:18:00,942 --> 00:18:01,942
Ian!

154
00:18:52,843 --> 00:18:53,743
Heavenly!

155
00:18:53,744 --> 00:18:55,444
Oh... hello!

156
00:18:56,345 --> 00:18:58,045
And goodbye.

157
00:19:04,945 --> 00:19:06,645
And when I woke up...

158
00:19:08,646 --> 00:19:10,846
I knew I was in the
middle of a nightmare.

159
00:19:18,247 --> 00:19:20,247
Iaaaaaannnnn!

160
00:19:21,948 --> 00:19:23,048
Help me!

161
00:19:49,348 --> 00:19:50,248
Stop!

162
00:19:54,049 --> 00:19:55,249
Heavenly...

163
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,350
What happened?

164
00:20:21,351 --> 00:20:23,451
Well, after I killed Matanza,

165
00:20:23,852 --> 00:20:25,552
I found you huddled
up in the corner,

166
00:20:25,553 --> 00:20:28,353
I thought you were dead with
all that blood all over you.

167
00:20:29,154 --> 00:20:31,354
I checked to see if
you were wounded,

168
00:20:31,755 --> 00:20:33,955
but there wasn't a scratch on you.

169
00:20:34,756 --> 00:20:38,456
I guess all that blood must've
belonged to that female officer.

170
00:20:38,757 --> 00:20:39,957
Did you black out?

171
00:20:40,758 --> 00:20:43,958
I got here as quick as
I could, I'm sorry.

172
00:20:44,859 --> 00:20:48,359
But Matanza... He had already...

173
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,260
<i>And that...</i>

174
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:05,261
<i>... was the moment
I knew I lost her.</i>

175
00:21:07,062 --> 00:21:09,662
<i>She never looked at me
the same way again.</i>

176
00:21:10,863 --> 00:21:12,563
That's the way she left me.

177
00:21:36,767 --> 00:21:38,667
I knew that I failed her.

178
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:41,968
She's better off without me.

179
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:46,351
Uh huh. This is all really
fascinating, Sparks,

180
00:21:46,352 --> 00:21:49,694
but let's just skip to the part
where you admit to the murders.

181
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:53,070
Or did you black that part out too?

182
00:22:03,171 --> 00:22:04,071
He's alive!

183
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,072
Barely.

184
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:07,573
From the looks of it he's
bleeding all over the place.

185
00:22:07,574 --> 00:22:10,574
I wanted to give you first crack
at him before I call it in.

186
00:22:10,575 --> 00:22:11,975
Half an hour.

187
00:22:21,976 --> 00:22:23,876
Come on Sparks, confess!

188
00:22:23,877 --> 00:22:27,777
Take your place at the cross
next to your sacred idols,

189
00:22:27,778 --> 00:22:31,678
Matanza, and Ringmaster Jesus.

190
00:22:36,379 --> 00:22:38,979
Nobody wants to read
about your life.

191
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:46,580
All they want, is a
picture of you...

192
00:22:46,681 --> 00:22:47,581
...Dead.

193
00:22:53,382 --> 00:22:55,182
What do you say, Sparks?

194
00:23:01,983 --> 00:23:03,183
It's dead.

195
00:23:08,984 --> 00:23:10,284
Follow me

196
00:23:10,385 --> 00:23:11,885
if you want to live.

197
00:23:14,286 --> 00:23:15,486
Docherty!

198
00:23:15,487 --> 00:23:17,187
People will want to
hear this chief.

199
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:18,888
Well, I'm staying here.

200
00:23:29,489 --> 00:23:32,289
- You're a reporter too?
- Not exactly.

201
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:34,090
Yes, sometimes.

202
00:23:34,691 --> 00:23:37,791
Sometimes I write
copy for obituaries.

203
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:38,892
Local folks,

204
00:23:39,093 --> 00:23:40,693
deceased, mostly.

205
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:42,694
I hope so.

206
00:23:52,695 --> 00:23:54,495
What are we doing?

207
00:23:54,596 --> 00:23:56,696
Stick a post behind this vent!

208
00:24:14,897 --> 00:24:17,697
By the age of twenty-three
I was washed up.

209
00:24:18,198 --> 00:24:19,698
My identity was shot.

210
00:24:20,299 --> 00:24:22,499
And I became a public joke.

211
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:34,303
That can happen, ya know.
I pulled a "Sparks" last night.

212
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:36,304
Blacked out. Right in the
middle of making whoopee.

213
00:24:36,805 --> 00:24:39,105
You know, my wife said
it was an improvement.

214
00:24:42,706 --> 00:24:44,906
But that wasn't the worst of it.

215
00:24:45,207 --> 00:24:48,407
All the scum I put down,
surfaced to pay me back.

216
00:24:48,808 --> 00:24:50,008
Just a minute...

217
00:24:50,409 --> 00:24:51,509
Hello?...

218
00:25:22,711 --> 00:25:23,911
<i>Nothing was sacred.</i>

219
00:25:27,213 --> 00:25:29,313
<i>I moved into my
grandmother's apartment,</i>

220
00:25:29,314 --> 00:25:31,514
<i>knowing they'd come back for me.</i>

221
00:25:31,815 --> 00:25:33,615
<i>I didn't have to wait long.</i>

222
00:25:37,216 --> 00:25:38,516
Gentlemen?

223
00:25:51,017 --> 00:25:53,717
<i>Some nights I'd even let
them get in some shots.</i>

224
00:25:54,518 --> 00:25:57,118
<i>Just to allow myself
to feel something.</i>

225
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:02,119
<i>Eventually there was
nobody left to fight.</i>

226
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,120
Sparks!

227
00:27:21,321 --> 00:27:22,121
Sparks!

228
00:27:22,922 --> 00:27:24,122
You up?

229
00:27:24,423 --> 00:27:25,723
Where are you?

230
00:27:27,525 --> 00:27:28,925
Rent's due.

231
00:27:29,326 --> 00:27:30,326
Again.

232
00:27:33,927 --> 00:27:36,327
I better see some rent
out of you today.

233
00:27:38,728 --> 00:27:40,328
Aw, Jesus!

234
00:27:42,329 --> 00:27:43,729
Another one.

235
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:47,930
Now you ain't gonna need this.

236
00:27:50,531 --> 00:27:52,731
Probably not gonna
need this either.

237
00:28:03,332 --> 00:28:04,732
That's a keeper.

238
00:28:05,133 --> 00:28:06,433
Goodbye Sparks.

239
00:28:07,934 --> 00:28:11,034
I'm gonna make a fortune off this.

240
00:28:14,835 --> 00:28:16,835
I got pictures of this whole thing.

241
00:28:33,636 --> 00:28:34,736
Doctor!

242
00:28:37,137 --> 00:28:39,737
Get this man to the O.R. now!

243
00:28:50,938 --> 00:28:52,438
- Leave now!
- You're not allowed...

244
00:29:08,239 --> 00:29:09,339
Ian.

245
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,940
Focus.

246
00:29:12,841 --> 00:29:15,541
Cogswell Road and Ramona. Midnight.

247
00:29:15,642 --> 00:29:16,642
Put this on.

248
00:29:17,143 --> 00:29:18,243
Leave now.

249
00:29:39,044 --> 00:29:41,244
<i>Mommy has something she
wants to tell you.</i>

250
00:29:50,345 --> 00:29:53,045
Scenery hasn't changed
much, has it?

251
00:29:59,446 --> 00:30:01,846
Been a lot of plans for this land.

252
00:30:02,647 --> 00:30:05,747
We were gonna build a tract of
homes all the way up to here.

253
00:30:07,148 --> 00:30:08,548
Didn't work out though.

254
00:30:08,549 --> 00:30:10,249
Nothing ever does.

255
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:12,650
Want to know why?

256
00:30:13,551 --> 00:30:14,751
The soil is tainted.

257
00:30:15,352 --> 00:30:17,052
It regenerates too fast.

258
00:30:17,053 --> 00:30:20,753
It's almost as if the land wants us to
remember what happened, right here.

259
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:24,954
What do you know about it?

260
00:30:35,955 --> 00:30:38,655
I was the one who pulled
you from that car, Ian.

261
00:30:42,556 --> 00:30:44,956
That's twice I've saved your life.

262
00:30:55,157 --> 00:30:57,257
After your first
run-in with Matanza,

263
00:30:57,258 --> 00:30:59,958
your grandmother asked
me to watch out for you.

264
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:02,259
How come I've never
seen you before?

265
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,560
It wasn't important
for you to see me.

266
00:31:04,961 --> 00:31:06,961
I was watching you.

267
00:31:07,062 --> 00:31:09,962
By the time you were 15 you were
handling yourself pretty well.

268
00:31:10,363 --> 00:31:13,963
So for the last few years, I've been
traveling back and forth from India.

269
00:31:14,564 --> 00:31:17,264
And whenever I was back in town I'd
check in with your grandmother.

270
00:31:17,565 --> 00:31:19,165
My condolences, by the way.

271
00:31:19,166 --> 00:31:20,866
She loved you very much.

272
00:31:24,667 --> 00:31:27,167
What did you shoot me up
with at the hospital?

273
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:31,168
Rare herb I brought
back from India.

274
00:31:31,269 --> 00:31:33,869
Its effects work instantaneously.

275
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:35,870
How come I didn't die?

276
00:31:35,971 --> 00:31:37,371
Beginner's luck.

277
00:31:37,372 --> 00:31:38,572
Tell me the truth.

278
00:31:40,373 --> 00:31:42,173
Do I have powers?

279
00:31:43,174 --> 00:31:44,074
No.

280
00:31:45,475 --> 00:31:48,075
Very few people have
any real ability.

281
00:31:48,776 --> 00:31:50,776
You've heard of the Rochester 13?

282
00:31:50,777 --> 00:31:51,777
Yeah.

283
00:31:51,878 --> 00:31:54,578
Most of them died soon
after their exposure.

284
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:57,679
The ones that survived kept
their abilities secret.

285
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:02,480
Those that had children passed
on their powers, genetically.

286
00:32:04,681 --> 00:32:07,281
So the only power
I have is to black out.

287
00:32:08,482 --> 00:32:10,482
Well we can work on that.

288
00:32:14,583 --> 00:32:16,483
<i>So we did work on
it, night and day.</i>

289
00:33:01,986 --> 00:33:03,686
What are we doing here?

290
00:33:04,487 --> 00:33:05,987
Paying our respects.

291
00:33:11,788 --> 00:33:13,088
What do you think?

292
00:33:16,589 --> 00:33:17,689
Thank you.

293
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:20,890
Now Ian,

294
00:33:21,191 --> 00:33:22,991
I want you to meet
some friends of mine.

295
00:33:42,192 --> 00:33:43,992
Oh, it's you.

296
00:33:44,693 --> 00:33:46,093
I was gettin' worried.

297
00:33:46,794 --> 00:33:50,994
Sparks was up here with a cockamamie
story about being murdered.

298
00:33:53,995 --> 00:33:55,095
Wait...

299
00:33:56,596 --> 00:33:58,496
How did you get up here?

300
00:34:02,597 --> 00:34:04,297
YOU cut the power!

301
00:34:17,498 --> 00:34:19,098
Hang in there, Mac.

302
00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:22,999
I might get murdered a few times
before I get to finish my story.

303
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,800
I met all types who had the moxie
to call themselves "Supers."

304
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:32,401
Hell. Everyone wanted to be a hero.

305
00:34:32,502 --> 00:34:35,817
You get yourself a cape and a
mask and a little bit of skill,

306
00:34:35,818 --> 00:34:37,803
you could pass yourself off as one.

307
00:34:37,804 --> 00:34:41,004
But this was the first time
I met people with real powers.

308
00:34:47,405 --> 00:34:49,905
You remember the Rochester 13?

309
00:34:51,106 --> 00:34:53,306
This rather large beast is Cain.

310
00:34:55,707 --> 00:34:58,007
This lovely creature is Dawn.

311
00:34:58,408 --> 00:35:00,408
They both have real powers.

312
00:35:01,408 --> 00:35:03,408
What kind of powers do you have?

313
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:12,710
What kind of powers do YOU have?

314
00:35:27,311 --> 00:35:30,911
Wow, you must keep a lot of
tombstone makers in business.

315
00:35:34,212 --> 00:35:36,712
So how come I've never seen people
with real powers before?

316
00:35:36,713 --> 00:35:39,413
The few of us with powers
don't want to be "Supers."

317
00:35:39,414 --> 00:35:41,414
...because "Supers"
usually means "freaks."

318
00:35:41,415 --> 00:35:45,915
And if we keep our powers secret,
we can go where the real action is.

319
00:35:45,916 --> 00:35:46,916
What does that mean?

320
00:35:46,917 --> 00:35:48,317
They're here to team up with you.

321
00:35:48,318 --> 00:35:49,618
To lead is more like it.

322
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:50,919
Enough Cain.

323
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:55,720
Look, whatever your plan is,
I don't have real powers, so...

324
00:35:55,721 --> 00:35:57,821
Why are you asking me
to be a part of this?

325
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,522
It wasn't my idea, "Sparky."

326
00:36:02,523 --> 00:36:03,723
Vengeance.

327
00:36:17,424 --> 00:36:19,224
I want to show you something, Ian.

328
00:36:23,225 --> 00:36:26,425
This is the man responsible
for your parents' deaths.

329
00:36:33,626 --> 00:36:35,691
Apparently, this
skull, Jason Driver,

330
00:36:35,692 --> 00:36:38,951
was selling some exotic predator
when the meteor struck.

331
00:36:39,227 --> 00:36:39,927
Cain!

332
00:36:41,228 --> 00:36:42,928
Stay the hell away from him!

333
00:36:45,629 --> 00:36:47,029
Go home, boy.

334
00:36:56,531 --> 00:37:00,731
The radiation from the meteor caused
his DNA to mix with the animal's

335
00:37:01,732 --> 00:37:04,932
Whatever Driver became,
it wasn't pretty.

336
00:37:05,234 --> 00:37:08,534
It was his goon that slammed
my parents' car into that train.

337
00:37:08,835 --> 00:37:10,735
...took down Archer's partner.

338
00:37:11,236 --> 00:37:13,036
Whatever the payback was

339
00:37:13,437 --> 00:37:15,237
...I was in.

340
00:37:19,238 --> 00:37:20,138
Hi.

341
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:21,639
Thank you.

342
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,440
Dawn!

343
00:37:26,241 --> 00:37:27,241
Yes?

344
00:37:27,742 --> 00:37:29,642
Why are you after this guy?

345
00:37:30,843 --> 00:37:33,143
He's always been a
nasty piece of work.

346
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:38,345
The night my brother drowned

347
00:37:39,446 --> 00:37:42,046
Jason... was the only person
with him.

348
00:37:43,247 --> 00:37:47,247
I couldn't prove he was responsible
but I knew in my heart he was.

349
00:37:50,948 --> 00:37:52,748
And now he's gonna pay.

350
00:37:54,549 --> 00:37:55,749
Sorry.

351
00:37:57,449 --> 00:37:58,949
You're very sweet.

352
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:21,050
Well, I'm gonna call it a night.

353
00:38:56,051 --> 00:38:57,551
You know I've met her

354
00:38:58,152 --> 00:38:59,252
I might...

355
00:38:59,753 --> 00:39:00,853
Who?

356
00:39:14,454 --> 00:39:15,554
I could...

357
00:39:16,655 --> 00:39:18,255
stay this way...

358
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,156
...if you like.

359
00:39:22,057 --> 00:39:23,657
It doesn't bother me.

360
00:39:25,258 --> 00:39:27,458
How long can you stay that way?

361
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:31,859
As long as it takes.

362
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,160
<i>I fooled the eyes in
order To heal the heart.</i>

363
00:39:47,461 --> 00:39:49,461
<i>Whatever it takes.</i>

364
00:39:57,563 --> 00:39:58,963
Last one.

365
00:40:01,764 --> 00:40:03,564
Are you sure we got enough?

366
00:40:03,565 --> 00:40:04,965
Strap it down.

367
00:40:05,066 --> 00:40:06,366
Let's get out of here.

368
00:40:07,367 --> 00:40:10,167
<i>Breaking news: The discovery of
two mutilated bodies</i>

369

370
00:40:14,169 --> 00:40:17,369

"the Matanza copy-cat killer."</i>

372
00:40:22,771 --> 00:40:23,971
Good morning.

373
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:26,672
Yes it is.

374
00:40:31,673 --> 00:40:35,673
<i>Sledge has assured citizens that he

<i>"Matanza copy cat killer."</i>

377
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:56,076
Can I ask you a question?

378
00:40:57,777 --> 00:40:58,877
Course.

379
00:40:59,378 --> 00:41:01,378
How did you get your powers?

380
00:41:04,179 --> 00:41:06,179
My mom married the wrong guy.

381
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:09,080
And I inherited my gift from him.

382
00:41:09,681 --> 00:41:11,881
Was he one of the Rochester 13?

383
00:41:12,482 --> 00:41:14,582
Yeah, he was the lay preacher.

384
00:41:15,983 --> 00:41:17,983
Better known as "Ringmaster Jesus."

385
00:41:19,784 --> 00:41:21,184
The serial killer?

386
00:41:21,685 --> 00:41:23,185
Good old Dad.

387
00:41:23,986 --> 00:41:26,986
You didn't inherit that
habit from him, did you?

388
00:41:27,787 --> 00:41:29,987
I just got the one gift.

389
00:41:30,188 --> 00:41:31,388
I for one

390
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:33,489
appreciate your gift.

391
00:41:36,589 --> 00:41:39,289
You can appreciate me
again if you want.

392
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:56,290
We go in five.

393
00:41:56,691 --> 00:41:59,291
We're not going through the front
door, Ian, so lose the costume.

394
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:01,092
Put these on instead.

395
00:42:01,393 --> 00:42:02,293
Dawn.

396
00:42:02,894 --> 00:42:05,094
Save some of your
talent for the job.

397
00:42:28,395 --> 00:42:31,895
Once we get there we'll have 15
minutes before the real crew arrives.

398
00:42:32,096 --> 00:42:32,896
No, no!

399
00:42:34,897 --> 00:42:36,497
...gas leak in here.

400
00:42:39,898 --> 00:42:42,698
<i>Driver's home was better
protected than the White House.</i>

401
00:42:43,099 --> 00:42:44,199

<i>twice a year,</i>

<i>he would emerge from his armed castle to
take meetings at a hotel in the city.</i>

404
00:42:58,202 --> 00:42:59,502
<i>The plan was simple</i>

405
00:42:59,703 --> 00:43:01,903
Dawn would get Driver
out of his room

406
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:03,904
I'd handle the guard.

407
00:43:03,905 --> 00:43:06,105
And Archer would shoot em dead.

408
00:43:22,806 --> 00:43:24,306
Kapoor Fishing?

409
00:43:42,907 --> 00:43:44,107
Here you go.

410
00:43:46,808 --> 00:43:47,808
Here

411
00:44:04,209 --> 00:44:05,609
Yes, what is it?

412
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:07,610
I just found his wallet
in the bathroom.

413
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:17,912
It's late.

414
00:44:30,713 --> 00:44:32,113
Archer did his homework.

415
00:44:32,614 --> 00:44:34,814
He knew that Driver was
a creature of habit.

416
00:44:35,015 --> 00:44:38,915
And he ordered the exact same room
and meal every time he stayed there.

417
00:44:42,516 --> 00:44:45,216
- You are very late.
- They had the whole place on lock down.

418
00:44:45,217 --> 00:44:47,217
- What is the room number?
- Sixteen.

419
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,218
- Guards?
- Four.

420
00:44:52,919 --> 00:44:54,019
Disappear.

421
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:56,920
Come on.

422
00:45:02,621 --> 00:45:04,021
You guys are late!

423
00:45:06,922 --> 00:45:08,022
Put this on.

424
00:45:53,923 --> 00:45:55,523
We're going in.

425
00:46:02,424 --> 00:46:03,524
Stop.

426
00:46:24,325 --> 00:46:25,725
Room Service.

427
00:46:28,126 --> 00:46:29,726
You're ten minutes early.

428
00:46:30,527 --> 00:46:31,627
Am I?

429
00:46:33,728 --> 00:46:34,628
Thank you.

430
00:46:35,929 --> 00:46:37,729
The twins are driving me crazy.

431
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:39,730
M'sieur...

432
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:41,631
Twins?

433
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:42,732
They are...

434
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:44,333
...adorable.

435
00:46:47,534 --> 00:46:49,334
You've met them before.

436
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:53,835
They've uh ...grown a lot
since your last visit.

437
00:46:56,236 --> 00:46:57,736
You're wearing perfume.

438
00:46:58,637 --> 00:46:59,737
No.

439
00:47:00,638 --> 00:47:01,838
It's cologne.

440
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:06,439
You can try telling your wife that,
but I doubt she'd believe you.

441
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,240
And speaking of which

442
00:47:20,241 --> 00:47:21,941
Where is you're wedding ring?

443
00:47:27,942 --> 00:47:29,042
Archer!

444
00:47:31,443 --> 00:47:32,543
Run!

445
00:47:37,044 --> 00:47:38,244
Ian! Now, now, now!

446
00:47:39,745 --> 00:47:41,245
Run, Ian, run!

447
00:47:53,546 --> 00:47:54,946
We gotta get Driver!

448
00:48:23,047 --> 00:48:24,447
Ian, can you hear me?

449
00:48:24,748 --> 00:48:25,648
Ian!

450
00:48:26,449 --> 00:48:28,049
He's not responding!

451
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:30,250
He'll live.

452
00:48:32,351 --> 00:48:33,851
Hang in there, Ian.

453
00:48:41,252 --> 00:48:42,552
Put this on.

454
00:48:49,153 --> 00:48:50,653
Take care of yourself, Ian.

455
00:49:19,755 --> 00:49:21,755
Son of a bitch, you made it.

456
00:49:23,856 --> 00:49:25,756
Alright, here's your cut.

457
00:49:36,157 --> 00:49:38,357
Buy yourself some clothes that fit.

458
00:49:38,758 --> 00:49:41,458
Why don't you buy a new face?

Part of it.

470
00:50:23,370 --> 00:50:26,470
He never would have gone for it
otherwise, but the best part

471
00:50:26,571 --> 00:50:29,571
is we got that bastard who killed
your parents, and my partner.

472

Yeah. yeah, we got him and everyone
else in a half mile radius!

There always are!

00:51:16,427 --> 00:51:18,287
and your future children,
each a big house.

488
00:51:18,288 --> 00:51:21,388
I certainly don't want to
disappoint my future wife now do I?

489
00:51:26,589 --> 00:51:28,789
What you gonna do with your
share of the money, boss?

490
00:51:29,490 --> 00:51:31,690
Put my money in a better bank.

491
00:51:32,391 --> 00:51:34,991
That's all of it. Why don't
we go get some whores?

492
00:53:05,492 --> 00:53:06,592
Rick!

493
00:53:06,693 --> 00:53:08,493
Rick I think we got a survivor!

494
00:53:08,694 --> 00:53:09,394
No!

495
00:53:09,395 --> 00:53:10,695
No witnesses!

496
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:12,696
Stop playing hero and come help me.

497
00:53:12,697 --> 00:53:14,497
I swear to God they're
gonna be here any minute!

498
00:53:14,498 --> 00:53:17,698
The whole town must have seen that train
blast from at least five miles away!

499
00:53:43,299 --> 00:53:46,299
They say people only get
good luck or bad luck.

500
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,300
But I got us both.

501
00:53:48,801 --> 00:53:51,401
And that's what really
happened that day, Ian.

502
00:53:54,102 --> 00:53:55,602
You're a dead man!

503
00:54:02,303 --> 00:54:04,203
We're the same, you and I, Ian

504
00:54:04,204 --> 00:54:06,104
You just haven't
figured it out yet.

505
00:54:07,305 --> 00:54:08,905
I'll see you in hell!

506
00:54:20,207 --> 00:54:22,907
Twenty-five people <i>
died in that explosion.</i>

507
00:54:24,208 --> 00:54:27,408
<i>Nobody bumps off that many
people and breezes off unscathed.</i>

508
00:54:28,209 --> 00:54:30,209
<i>Karma and Revenge.</i>

509
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:31,910
<i>Both will be paid in full.</i>

510
00:55:33,410 --> 00:55:37,610
<i>Between finding out that a dirty cop
was responsible for my parents' deaths</i>

511
00:55:38,211 --> 00:55:40,111
<i>and what happened at that hotel</i>

512
00:55:40,812 --> 00:55:43,012
I had no fight left in me.

513
00:55:43,613 --> 00:55:45,213
It drove me out of
the hero business

514
00:55:45,214 --> 00:55:48,114
and into a three piece
suit with a new identity

515
00:55:48,615 --> 00:55:50,515
I was in the advertising business

516
00:55:50,516 --> 00:55:52,616
where no one cared
about saving anybody.

517
00:55:53,117 --> 00:55:55,617
I was writing copy -
or attempting to.

518
00:55:56,418 --> 00:55:58,618
I lasted a full two whole weeks.

519
00:56:07,419 --> 00:56:08,419
Steve?

520
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:10,220
Mr. Blasini would like to see you.

521
00:56:16,021 --> 00:56:17,421
Come in, Steve.

522
00:56:18,922 --> 00:56:20,122
Look!

523
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:21,423
I'm a straight shooter.

524
00:56:21,724 --> 00:56:24,124
You can't write for crap
so I'm going to fire you.

525
00:56:24,525 --> 00:56:25,625
But -

526
00:56:25,826 --> 00:56:28,626
There is one story that
I'd like you to tell.

527
00:56:28,627 --> 00:56:31,427
And I'm going to give you
a day's pay to get it.

528
00:56:32,428 --> 00:56:34,128
What story is that?

529
00:56:34,229 --> 00:56:36,129
I want you to tell me...

530
00:56:38,330 --> 00:56:40,230
What she's really like,

531
00:56:40,231 --> 00:56:41,331
Sparks.

532
00:57:03,932 --> 00:57:05,432
The lady was a great partner.

533
00:57:05,433 --> 00:57:07,033
Don't be a chump.

534
00:57:07,034 --> 00:57:08,834
I know her, remember?

535
00:57:08,834 --> 00:57:10,434
We do her ads.

536
00:57:10,535 --> 00:57:13,235
Now I know that you two
were more than just...

537
00:57:13,636 --> 00:57:15,336
...battling buddies...

538
00:57:16,637 --> 00:57:19,637
So I'd like you to tell
me what she's like...

539
00:57:19,838 --> 00:57:21,238
...horizontally.

540
00:57:23,939 --> 00:57:26,839
Damn shame! She's engaged!

541
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:28,840
...to Sledge.

542
00:57:30,541 --> 00:57:33,441
I'd pay good money to
lay down with her.

543
00:57:34,442 --> 00:57:35,842
Good money.

544
00:57:42,043 --> 00:57:43,843
She was his lady now.

545
00:57:45,944 --> 00:57:47,944
She moved on.

546
00:57:51,245 --> 00:57:53,945
Me, I never got over the attack.

547
00:57:54,946 --> 00:57:56,846
I held on tight to it.

548
00:57:58,647 --> 00:58:01,447
I ran over the scenario
every which way.

549
00:58:03,548 --> 00:58:06,048
No matter how many times
I saved her in my dreams,

550
00:58:06,049 --> 00:58:08,649
I always woke up on the losing end.

551
00:58:12,350 --> 00:58:14,650
I'm not proud of what I did next.

552
00:58:16,151 --> 00:58:18,751
But any memory of her
was better than none.

553
00:58:21,452 --> 00:58:24,252
It took me a couple of months
to track down the pro skirt

554
00:58:24,253 --> 00:58:26,453
that was gonna help me
get back on my feet.

555
00:58:32,854 --> 00:58:34,954
That's a new look, Dawn.

556
00:58:35,155 --> 00:58:36,555
Even for you.

557
00:58:38,456 --> 00:58:41,656
- I'm sorry, you got the wrong room.
- I don't think so, sweetheart.

558
00:58:42,057 --> 00:58:44,057
I've been watching you for an hour.

559
00:58:45,358 --> 00:58:48,558
You got more traffic coming in and
out of here than a bus terminal.

560
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:51,059
What do you want, Sparks?

561
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:55,260
But you didn't take the money.

562
00:58:56,861 --> 00:58:58,361
Children were killed, Ian.

563
00:58:58,662 --> 00:59:01,362
And I don't take blood money.

564
00:59:01,763 --> 00:59:04,163
Hmmm. Interesting set of
morals you got there.

565
00:59:05,464 --> 00:59:06,364
So, uh...

566
00:59:06,365 --> 00:59:10,565
All that jawing about Driver killing
your brother, that was all bull?

567
00:59:12,366 --> 00:59:15,566
He called me! Now what do you
want, Ian, I have company coming.

568
00:59:15,967 --> 00:59:18,867
I'll start with a drink, but I'm
gonna have to pass on supper.

569
00:59:19,968 --> 00:59:22,168
You just wasted twenty seconds.

570
00:59:23,469 --> 00:59:25,769
Is there any reason why this
Wom painting wouldn't do?

571
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:26,670
Thirty

572
00:59:26,671 --> 00:59:27,871
That's personal.

573
00:59:29,672 --> 00:59:33,672
What level of intimacy does one have to
reach in order to get personal with you?

574
00:59:33,973 --> 00:59:37,173
Well I wouldn't know, you've only
been intimate with me since the Lady.

575
00:59:38,374 --> 00:59:39,574
Touché.

576
00:59:39,775 --> 00:59:41,775
Which brings me to the
reason why I'm here.

577
00:59:41,776 --> 00:59:42,675
Look...

578
00:59:42,676 --> 00:59:45,176
I'm all torn up. we never properly
said goodbye.

579
00:59:45,177 --> 00:59:47,077
But that, Sparks, was
almost a year ago

580
00:59:47,078 --> 00:59:49,578
And if you think I 'm going to
service you for old times sake -

581
00:59:49,579 --> 00:59:52,279
No, not me, someone else.

582
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:54,680
Someone very, very rich.

583
00:59:55,881 --> 00:59:59,381
Rich enough to get you out of
this dump and into a museum

584
00:59:59,382 --> 01:00:01,782
that you can fill with
the exact same painting.

585
01:00:03,883 --> 01:00:05,583
So I gotta ask,

586
01:00:06,084 --> 01:00:08,284
Why so many copies of
the same painting?

587
01:00:08,785 --> 01:00:11,485
My mother had these four
copies up in her house.

588
01:00:11,486 --> 01:00:14,886
She put them up the night my
brother and father left us.

589
01:00:14,887 --> 01:00:18,087
So this is... "Ringmaster Jesus."

590
01:00:18,888 --> 01:00:20,088
Yeah, that's him.

591
01:00:20,189 --> 01:00:22,389
The kid next to him is my brother.

592
01:00:22,990 --> 01:00:24,090
What was he like?

593
01:00:24,091 --> 01:00:26,891
I wouldn't know, they both
took off the night I was born.

594
01:00:27,492 --> 01:00:29,492
Supposedly to do God's work.

595
01:00:29,493 --> 01:00:32,193
Apparently God's work
included murder.

596
01:00:39,394 --> 01:00:41,194
How much you make in a night, Dawn?

597
01:00:41,295 --> 01:00:42,395
20 bucks.

598
01:00:42,796 --> 01:00:44,496
How's 200 sound?

599
01:00:45,597 --> 01:00:48,597
Hmmm. From "super" to "pimp," Interesting
set of morals you got there.

600
01:00:49,998 --> 01:00:51,998
Do we have a deal?

601
01:00:58,899 --> 01:00:59,999
What a Woman!

602
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:03,100
A body like hers she
could raise the dead.

603
01:01:03,801 --> 01:01:05,101
Well congratulations,

604
01:01:05,202 --> 01:01:07,102
Mr Associate Creative Manager.

605
01:01:07,503 --> 01:01:09,203
I think you mean
"Creative Director."

606
01:01:09,204 --> 01:01:10,704
Yeah, next time.

607
01:01:10,705 --> 01:01:14,605
If we can meet some place where the only
thing sucking on my toes is the lady.

608
01:01:24,106 --> 01:01:25,806
How about a toast?

609
01:01:26,507 --> 01:01:28,107
Here's to...

610
01:01:28,108 --> 01:01:29,808
...a new future.

611
01:01:33,309 --> 01:01:35,409
But a new past.

612
01:01:37,710 --> 01:01:39,010
Not exactly.

613
01:01:50,311 --> 01:01:52,011
You're 150 short.

614
01:02:01,012 --> 01:02:02,112
But...

615
01:02:03,513 --> 01:02:05,313
since we 're old friends...

616
01:02:11,714 --> 01:02:14,914
For three months, our arrangement
was hitting on all eights.

617
01:02:15,315 --> 01:02:17,315
'til Lady Luck finally ran out.

618
01:02:18,816 --> 01:02:19,816
I love it.

619
01:02:20,617 --> 01:02:24,017
Heroine pose? Alright...
let's see some strength.

620
01:02:25,518 --> 01:02:26,718
There we are...

621
01:02:27,019 --> 01:02:30,419
Now let's bring the can of D'Vita
slowly toward your mouth,

622
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:33,120
like you're gonna
give a big, wet kiss.

623
01:02:34,421 --> 01:02:36,021
Lady, perhaps a little less teeth,

624
01:02:36,022 --> 01:02:37,922
We don't want to
frighten the cocoa.

625
01:02:38,023 --> 01:02:39,123
Orsen!

626
01:02:39,524 --> 01:02:40,524
Reload!

627
01:02:41,125 --> 01:02:44,525
Excellent work, Orsen,
that is why I overpay you.

628
01:02:46,026 --> 01:02:47,126
My "Lady."

629
01:02:47,427 --> 01:02:49,027
Personally I think...

630
01:02:57,528 --> 01:02:58,528
Props!

631
01:03:30,129 --> 01:03:31,029
Dawn!

632
01:03:31,430 --> 01:03:32,730
What a surprise!

633
01:03:34,131 --> 01:03:35,231
Come in.

634
01:03:46,632 --> 01:03:48,332
Have a drink with me.

635
01:03:50,533 --> 01:03:51,633
What's wrong?

636
01:03:52,034 --> 01:03:53,534
Did he get rough with you?

637
01:03:53,735 --> 01:03:55,636
Because if he got rough
with you then I...

638
01:03:56,436 --> 01:03:57,936
What the hell was that for?

639
01:03:57,937 --> 01:03:59,737
That's for hiring that whore

640
01:03:59,738 --> 01:04:02,938
Who's spreading her legs
pretending to be ME!

641
01:04:04,439 --> 01:04:05,839
Heavenly?

642
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:07,040
Yeah.

643
01:04:08,641 --> 01:04:09,841
Heavenly...

644
01:04:14,142 --> 01:04:15,542
Look at me, Ian!

645
01:04:16,943 --> 01:04:17,943
Look at me!

646
01:04:18,844 --> 01:04:22,444
Try not to black out before
hearing this part, Ian.

647
01:04:22,445 --> 01:04:24,445
If I have to come back

648
01:04:25,446 --> 01:04:27,546
you won't ever walk again.

649
01:04:32,947 --> 01:04:35,647
You're just lucky Sledge
didn't come calling.

650
01:04:39,448 --> 01:04:40,648
Heavenly!

651
01:04:44,749 --> 01:04:46,949
What the hell happened to you, Ian?

652
01:04:57,650 --> 01:04:58,950
<i>But she was wrong.</i>

653
01:04:58,951 --> 01:05:00,651
He did come calling.

654
01:05:01,252 --> 01:05:03,152
Later that evening, in fact.

655
01:05:21,553 --> 01:05:23,153
Ian Sparks?

656
01:05:23,754 --> 01:05:25,554
Who wants to know?

657
01:05:26,055 --> 01:05:28,055
My name is Mr. Prather.

658
01:05:29,456 --> 01:05:30,856
May I come in?

659
01:05:30,957 --> 01:05:32,657
I'm not in the mood for company.

660
01:05:32,658 --> 01:05:34,258
I have something...

661
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:36,859
which might put you in the mood.

662
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:39,760
You look familiar.

663
01:05:40,461 --> 01:05:42,161
Have I met you before?

664
01:05:42,662 --> 01:05:44,162
I have that kind of face.

665
01:05:44,663 --> 01:05:46,963
I'm here on behalf of Mr. Sledge.

666
01:05:47,264 --> 01:05:51,864
Oh. Yes. His fiancee stopped
by earlier and redecorated.

667
01:05:51,865 --> 01:05:53,165
Yes. Apparently.

668
01:05:53,966 --> 01:05:57,966
Mr. Sledge has a problem which
you may be able to help him with.

669
01:05:59,167 --> 01:06:03,367
Before you tell me your problem how about
you tell me how much is in that briefcase?

670
01:06:05,168 --> 01:06:06,968
How much would you like it to be?

671
01:06:09,569 --> 01:06:10,969
Five hundred cash.

672
01:06:10,970 --> 01:06:13,370
No, I'm so sorry to disappoint you.

673
01:06:13,671 --> 01:06:14,671
It's much,

674
01:06:14,972 --> 01:06:16,072
Much more.

675
01:06:18,873 --> 01:06:20,873
Well, you're out of my interests.

676
01:06:21,174 --> 01:06:23,174
I'd offer you a drink but...

677
01:06:23,175 --> 01:06:25,575
I seem to be out of glasses.

678
01:06:25,876 --> 01:06:27,276
May I sit?

679
01:06:27,477 --> 01:06:28,677
Help yourself.

680
01:06:32,378 --> 01:06:33,478
Mr. Sparks,

681
01:06:33,479 --> 01:06:37,179
we have a very delicate situation.

682
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:41,280
And what I reveal here must
be kept in total confidence.

683
01:06:41,581 --> 01:06:43,081
I'm all ears.

684
01:06:43,582 --> 01:06:45,382
I'm sure you recall...

685
01:06:45,483 --> 01:06:49,583
that painful evening when
Matanza brutalized Lady.

686
01:06:52,284 --> 01:06:54,384
You do remember, don't you?

687
01:06:54,485 --> 01:06:56,785
Yeah, I remember.

688
01:06:57,386 --> 01:06:59,986
What does that have to do
with Sledge's little problem?

689
01:07:00,287 --> 01:07:02,787
Well it seems that
since that time...

690
01:07:04,088 --> 01:07:05,688
This is very delicate.

691
01:07:06,289 --> 01:07:09,889
The Lady has been unable to
consummate their relationship.

692
01:07:12,090 --> 01:07:13,190
Really?

693
01:07:13,191 --> 01:07:15,491
Yes, it's very sad.

694
01:07:16,992 --> 01:07:18,592
There are other women.

695
01:07:18,593 --> 01:07:21,393
I asked him if another woman
would be of interest.

696
01:07:21,794 --> 01:07:25,194
And he replied that the Lady
was the only one he wants.

697
01:07:28,095 --> 01:07:30,195
God, I've got The Lady.

698
01:07:32,896 --> 01:07:34,496
Inside you will find,

699
01:07:34,497 --> 01:07:35,997
the address of the hotel,

700
01:07:35,998 --> 01:07:37,798
and the room key.

701
01:07:37,999 --> 01:07:40,499
Your Lady will arrive at
11:00 pm tomorrow night.

702
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:42,900
And if all goes accordingly,

703
01:07:43,101 --> 01:07:45,501
we'll keep the real Lady in check.

704
01:07:47,202 --> 01:07:49,002
Do we have an understanding?

705
01:07:51,103 --> 01:07:52,103
Yeah.

706
01:08:14,504 --> 01:08:16,204
I'll tell you what I'll do, Ian,

707
01:08:16,205 --> 01:08:19,905
I'll scream your name out loud,
at the most inappropriate time.

708
01:08:23,006 --> 01:08:24,506
How does that sound?

709
01:08:29,507 --> 01:08:31,307
It won't be difficult.

710
01:08:32,208 --> 01:08:35,308
I never had to act with you.

711
01:08:41,209 --> 01:08:42,609
Who knows?

712
01:08:42,810 --> 01:08:45,810
Maybe when this is all over -
well, we can go on a trip.

713
01:08:49,411 --> 01:08:50,911
You deserve better.

714
01:08:52,112 --> 01:08:54,112
I can't do this any more.

715
01:08:56,613 --> 01:08:59,413
When you get back, the car
and all the money is yours.

716
01:09:48,414 --> 01:09:49,514
What the hell ...?

717
01:10:05,315 --> 01:10:06,515
Dawn, no!

718
01:10:06,716 --> 01:10:07,716
NO, NO!

719
01:10:32,017 --> 01:10:33,917
Mommy has something she
wants to tell you.

720
01:10:34,918 --> 01:10:36,118
Here.

721
01:10:37,719 --> 01:10:39,119
Can you feel him kicking?

722
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:41,520
Well maybe it's too soon.

723
01:10:51,521 --> 01:10:53,621
Are you excited to
have a little brother?

724
01:10:53,922 --> 01:10:55,622
What do you think
we should name him?

725
01:11:07,723 --> 01:11:09,423
Ian, get down!

726
01:11:45,224 --> 01:11:46,424
Oh God...

727
01:11:49,925 --> 01:11:51,425
Dawn.

728
01:11:53,226 --> 01:11:55,426
Oh God... I'm sorry.

729
01:12:04,927 --> 01:12:07,627
We have confirmation.
Two shots were fired.

730
01:12:07,628 --> 01:12:09,828
Registration belongs to Ian Sparks.

731
01:12:10,029 --> 01:12:12,729
Alright, Carlton, Johanson,
you check the hotel.

732
01:12:12,730 --> 01:12:14,430
Mitchell sweep this lot.

733
01:13:45,331 --> 01:13:47,122
Nothing about the
place had changed,

734
01:13:47,148 --> 01:13:50,656
the only thing different was
the way I walked into it.

735
01:13:53,032 --> 01:13:55,232
It started to make sense.

736
01:13:55,333 --> 01:13:58,633
The sewer was now the only way
to get to Matanza's lair.

737
01:13:58,634 --> 01:14:01,334
Above the ground they placed a
concrete wall around the building

738
01:14:01,335 --> 01:14:03,335
so nobody could gain access.

739
01:14:03,936 --> 01:14:06,536
Sledge even made a photo op of it.

740
01:14:17,037 --> 01:14:19,437
In a lair full of secrets.

741
01:14:20,738 --> 01:14:23,338
I'd discovered the ultimate one.

742
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:52,939
Oh, Hello and goodbye.

743
01:14:54,940 --> 01:14:57,040
It all suddenly became clear.

744
01:14:57,041 --> 01:14:58,541
I did have a power.

745
01:14:59,042 --> 01:15:01,442
And it was a hell
of a power at that.

746
01:15:02,843 --> 01:15:04,443
Help!

747
01:15:04,543 --> 01:15:06,243
Iaaaannnnn!

748
01:15:06,244 --> 01:15:07,744
Help me!

749
01:16:26,845 --> 01:16:30,045
<i>Oh, Hello and goodbye.</i>

750
01:16:45,646 --> 01:16:48,347
<i>Stop! You can't!</i>

751
01:16:48,448 --> 01:16:49,648
<i>I won't let you.</i>

752
01:16:49,949 --> 01:16:52,049
<i>Not her! Not this way!</i>

753
01:16:52,450 --> 01:16:54,850
<i>No, you can't! Please!</i>

754
01:17:06,451 --> 01:17:07,751
Hey Doll!

755
01:17:18,552 --> 01:17:22,852
<i>Meet me at the Interplay Factory at 11 pm.
PS: The ring was always meant for you.</i>

756
01:17:29,353 --> 01:17:31,253
<i>Even with the cops after me</i>

757
01:17:31,554 --> 01:17:33,654
<i>all I could think about was her.</i>

758
01:17:33,955 --> 01:17:36,655
<i>I didn't know if she would
watch the film or not.</i>

759
01:17:36,856 --> 01:17:37,756
<i>But,</i>

760
01:17:38,357 --> 01:17:39,957
<i>to see her again,</i>

761
01:17:40,658 --> 01:17:42,358
<i>It was all worth the risk.</i>

762
01:17:52,759 --> 01:17:53,659
Ian!

763
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:57,160
I'm so sorry!

764
01:18:18,761 --> 01:18:19,861
Hello.

765
01:18:29,162 --> 01:18:30,962
And... goodbye.

766
01:18:32,863 --> 01:18:33,963
Again.

767
01:19:04,164 --> 01:19:04,964
Ian.

768
01:19:05,565 --> 01:19:06,365
Ian!

769
01:19:40,866 --> 01:19:43,966
I think we've got enough to write
the story on tape, don't you?

770
01:19:45,367 --> 01:19:47,567
Take that recorder and
stay out of sight.

771
01:20:12,168 --> 01:20:13,968
When I'm done with you, Sledge,

772
01:20:13,969 --> 01:20:15,769
There won't be a scratch on me.

773
01:20:34,970 --> 01:20:36,370
This is for Dawn!

774
01:20:36,471 --> 01:20:37,571
Your sister.

775
01:20:37,672 --> 01:20:40,072
Or didn't your dad tell
you she was your sister?

776
01:20:42,173 --> 01:20:44,873
This is for the Lady
you didn't protect!

777
01:20:45,574 --> 01:20:46,674
And this...

778
01:20:47,975 --> 01:20:49,775
...this is just for me.

779
01:21:05,176 --> 01:21:06,376
Impressive.

780
01:21:07,477 --> 01:21:09,277
He's still alive.

781
01:21:17,678 --> 01:21:19,278
Get up.

782
01:21:20,279 --> 01:21:22,179
I gotta get Heavenly.

783
01:21:22,580 --> 01:21:24,980
Well, that's going to
be difficult, son.

784
01:21:26,681 --> 01:21:28,381
What are you talking about?

785
01:21:29,282 --> 01:21:31,582
We should have killed
her a long time ago.

786
01:21:34,083 --> 01:21:35,883
Better late than never.

787
01:21:36,684 --> 01:21:37,684
NO!

788
01:21:38,285 --> 01:21:39,485
NO!

789
01:23:12,486 --> 01:23:15,186
What does it take to kill you,
Mr. Sparks?

790
01:23:16,787 --> 01:23:18,187
Knives, or...

791
01:23:19,088 --> 01:23:20,288
Guns?

792
01:23:21,889 --> 01:23:22,989
No.

793
01:23:23,490 --> 01:23:24,790
Gravity...

794
01:23:26,691 --> 01:23:28,191
...apparently not.

795
01:23:29,292 --> 01:23:30,592
Not a damn thing.

796
01:24:01,293 --> 01:24:02,393
Over here!

797
01:24:09,194 --> 01:24:10,994
<i>Despite being shot by Matanza,</i>

798
01:24:10,995 --> 01:24:14,595
<i>according to the medical report, the
Titanium from Ian Sparks's ring</i>

799
01:24:14,596 --> 01:24:17,696
<i>prevented the bullet from
fully lodging in her chest.</i>

800
01:24:17,697 --> 01:24:19,797
She's still alive,
get an ambulance.

801
01:24:19,798 --> 01:24:21,198
Get an ambulance!

802
01:24:34,399 --> 01:24:38,199
<i>Inside his lair, the true identity
of Matanza was discovered.</i>

803
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:41,500
<i>His real name was Kevin Sherwood.</i>

804
01:24:41,501 --> 01:24:45,201
<i>An evangelical preacher better
known as "Ringmaster Jesus."</i>

805
01:24:46,202 --> 01:24:48,502
Sherwood was one of
thirteen people exposed

806
01:24:48,503 --> 01:24:53,703
to the radiation from the meteor that fell
in Rochester, New York on July 6, 1917.

807
01:24:54,304 --> 01:24:56,804
Sherwood abandoned his
then-pregnant wife

808
01:24:56,805 --> 01:25:00,505
<i>and along with his twelve year old
son began his reign of terror.</i>

809
01:25:00,506 --> 01:25:03,906
<i>With what we now learned, was his
ability to change his identity,</i>

810
01:25:03,907 --> 01:25:06,507
<i>by morphing into the
serial killer Matanza.</i>

811
01:25:06,508 --> 01:25:09,408
<i>And more recently,
the "Matanza copycat killer."</i>

812
01:25:10,009 --> 01:25:12,809
<i>When "Supers" Ian Sparks and
Lady Heavenly were captured,</i>

813
01:25:12,810 --> 01:25:15,910
Matanza seized the opportunity
to fake his own death,

814
01:25:15,911 --> 01:25:18,111
allowing him to continue
his murder spree

815
01:25:18,112 --> 01:25:20,112
<i>with the aid of his son Sledge.</i>

816
01:25:20,613 --> 01:25:24,713
The two men later framed former
disgraced vigilante "super" Ian Sparks

817
01:25:24,714 --> 01:25:27,014
for the Matanza copycat murders.

818
01:25:27,015 --> 01:25:31,215
<i>But in the end, Matanza and Sledge
under-estimated Ian Sparks,</i>

819
01:25:31,216 --> 01:25:34,016
A man who inherited through
a childhood tragedy

820
01:25:34,017 --> 01:25:38,017
an extraordinary power he
himself only recently discovered.

821
01:25:43,718 --> 01:25:48,218
<i>Ironically, Ian Sparks started his
morning as public enemy No. 1</i>

822
01:25:48,219 --> 01:25:51,219
<i>and ended it with a
return to grace.</i>

823
01:26:23,721 --> 01:26:24,421
No!

824
01:26:24,422 --> 01:26:25,622
No! No!

825
01:26:55,223 --> 01:26:57,823
I knew you'd eventually
find your way here.

826
01:27:01,224 --> 01:27:02,924
I'm not here for you.

827
01:27:03,125 --> 01:27:04,725
You and I are square.

828
01:27:05,526 --> 01:27:08,826
I want you to know I had no idea there
were children in that building.

829
01:27:09,427 --> 01:27:11,427
The same as your parents.

830
01:27:13,228 --> 01:27:15,028
It was supposed to
be a simple robbery,

831
01:27:15,629 --> 01:27:18,229
it all went wrong because of him.

832
01:27:18,230 --> 01:27:19,230
Where is he?

833
01:27:20,031 --> 01:27:22,031
He's locked up in the back room.

834
01:27:25,432 --> 01:27:26,832
By the way,

835
01:27:27,533 --> 01:27:29,333
every time I kill him,

836
01:27:29,634 --> 01:27:32,334
It keeps taking longer
for him to come back.

837
01:27:55,335 --> 01:27:56,035
Ian.

838
01:27:56,036 --> 01:27:56,636
Yeah.

839
01:27:56,637 --> 01:27:57,237
Ian!

840
01:27:57,238 --> 01:27:59,238
Oh, God, Ian!

841
01:28:01,639 --> 01:28:03,039
Where's Driver?

842
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:04,440
Did you kill him?

843
01:28:05,241 --> 01:28:06,141
No.

844
01:28:06,742 --> 01:28:09,442
You gotta help me, we
need to get out of here.

845
01:28:09,443 --> 01:28:11,243
We need to get out of here,
I have all your money.

846
01:28:11,244 --> 01:28:13,144
You can have mine too.
Every bit of it.

847
01:28:13,145 --> 01:28:14,945
No, no, you've got the wrong idea.

848
01:28:16,246 --> 01:28:17,846
I'm just here to visit.

849
01:28:18,147 --> 01:28:20,847
You have to help me get out of here
I saved your life twice!

850
01:28:21,148 --> 01:28:23,248
Ian please You're better than this.

851
01:28:23,649 --> 01:28:25,049
You're better than me, come on!

852
01:28:25,050 --> 01:28:26,450
- Am I?
- Yes!

853
01:28:26,451 --> 01:28:28,851
- Really?
- Yes, damn it, help me!

854
01:28:30,952 --> 01:28:32,952
You know, that's interesting.

855
01:28:33,853 --> 01:28:37,253
On my way over here, I got a
chance to catch up on some reading.

856
01:28:37,254 --> 01:28:41,154
I was particularly interested in
the story of the Last Supper.

857
01:28:41,155 --> 01:28:44,855
- You got time for a story. Right?
- What? What are you talking about?

858
01:28:44,856 --> 01:28:47,137
Now, Da Vinci he didn't
want to paint Jesus

859
01:28:47,163 --> 01:28:49,056
just like every other
artist before,

860
01:28:49,057 --> 01:28:53,057
He wanted to capture a normal
man with the same qualities,

861
01:28:53,558 --> 01:28:56,558
So Da Vinci went out
looking for his Jesus

862
01:28:56,559 --> 01:28:58,259
and eventually he found him.

863
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:02,260
The man he settled on was loved
by everyone in the village.

864
01:29:02,361 --> 01:29:05,061
Worked with the sick,
tended to the poor

865
01:29:05,262 --> 01:29:06,862
Da Vinci was ecstatic.

866
01:29:07,463 --> 01:29:09,463
And when he completed his work,

867
01:29:09,764 --> 01:29:11,964
It was time to find his Judas.

868
01:29:12,765 --> 01:29:14,065
For several months,

869
01:29:14,066 --> 01:29:16,118
Da Vinci went from
prison to prison,

870
01:29:16,144 --> 01:29:19,591
looking for a convict
who was evil incarnate.

871
01:29:19,967 --> 01:29:23,667
And the man he settled on
was a serial child killer.

872
01:29:23,968 --> 01:29:25,368
For three days,

873
01:29:26,269 --> 01:29:29,669
Da Vinci painted this
man, who remained silent.

874
01:29:29,670 --> 01:29:33,170
And when he finished his painting
the man spoke for the first time.

875
01:29:33,171 --> 01:29:34,271
He said:

876
01:29:34,572 --> 01:29:36,072
"Do you remember me?"

877
01:29:37,873 --> 01:29:39,773
Da Vinci said "No."

878
01:29:40,174 --> 01:29:41,974
The man laughed,

879
01:29:42,575 --> 01:29:44,775
and he said, "But you have met me."

880
01:29:44,776 --> 01:29:46,276
Damn it, Ian.

881
01:29:46,577 --> 01:29:49,177
- "I was your Christ."
- Damn it Ian!

882
01:29:49,878 --> 01:29:51,678
- Do you like my little story?
- No!

883
01:29:51,679 --> 01:29:52,679
Help me!

884
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:55,281
Do you recognize the main character?
No, damn it!

885
01:29:57,882 --> 01:30:01,582
I never properly thanked you
for saving my life, so...

886
01:30:01,884 --> 01:30:03,584
...I brought you a little present.

887
01:30:03,985 --> 01:30:05,985
It took me a while
to track it down.

888
01:30:06,586 --> 01:30:07,986
Skillfully made.

889
01:30:08,587 --> 01:30:10,187
Oh, God, no...

890
01:30:10,188 --> 01:30:13,688
Scientists in India
tested this on soldiers,

891
01:30:13,689 --> 01:30:16,689
and found that it helped
them heal more quickly.

892
01:30:17,190 --> 01:30:21,490
They theorized that if you were
exposed to a massive dose of "Red G"

893
01:30:21,491 --> 01:30:23,691
It could cause rapid regeneration.

894
01:30:23,992 --> 01:30:28,792
In fact our own military purchased three
tons of this special herb for tests.

895
01:30:28,793 --> 01:30:29,693
Don't do this.

896
01:30:29,694 --> 01:30:33,594
It seems that when they loaded it onto
a train to send to West Virginia,

897
01:30:33,595 --> 01:30:35,395
the train got derailed.

898
01:30:35,696 --> 01:30:37,696
Apparently a police car,

899
01:30:37,997 --> 01:30:40,197
was in pursuit of a bank robber

900
01:30:40,198 --> 01:30:43,098
and crashed their vehicle
into a family car.

901
01:30:44,299 --> 01:30:46,099
Sent it right into the train.

902
01:30:47,100 --> 01:30:48,900
Oh God, no!

903
01:30:48,901 --> 01:30:49,901
Enjoy.

904
01:30:49,902 --> 01:30:52,102
No, no, no, no, no...

905
01:30:52,203 --> 01:30:53,903
Iaaannnnn!

906
01:30:54,404 --> 01:30:55,904
Iaaannnnn!

907
01:31:05,705 --> 01:31:07,905
We have a possible break-in,
at the Brewing company,

908
01:31:07,906 --> 01:31:10,006
at the corner of 4th and Broadway.

909
01:31:29,807 --> 01:31:30,907
Evening, "Lady."

910
01:31:30,908 --> 01:31:33,208
- Good evening,
- Welcome back.

911
01:31:33,509 --> 01:31:35,209
This should be an easy one for you.

912
01:31:35,510 --> 01:31:37,310
One small perp.

913
01:31:37,911 --> 01:31:39,311
He's up on the roof.

914
01:31:41,512 --> 01:31:42,512
Thanks.

915
01:32:32,814 --> 01:32:34,014
Ian.

916
01:33:14,815 --> 01:33:20,015
