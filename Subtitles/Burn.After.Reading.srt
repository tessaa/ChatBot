1
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,290
Ozzie. Come on in.

2
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:44,264
Palmer. What's up?

3
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,497
You know Peck
and Olson.

4
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:50,075
Peck, yes, hiya.
Olson, by reputation.

5
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:54,510
I'm Osborne Cox.

6
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:55,843
Yeah, hi.

7
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:58,445
Aren't you with...
Isn't he...

8
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:00,918
Yeah, that's right.
Have a seat.

9
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:04,007
Look, Oz,
look.

10
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:06,585
There's no easy
way to say this.

11
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,224
We're taking you off
the Balkans desk.

12
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,424
What? Why?

13
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,628
In fact, we're moving you
out of SIGINT entirely.

14
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,897
Just... No discussion?
Just "You're out"?

15
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:23,976
Well, we're having
the discussion now.

16
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:28,844
Look, Oz, this doesn't
have to be unpleasant.

17
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:32,708
Palmer,
with all due respect,

18
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:36,345
what the fuck are
you talking about?

19
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:38,481
And why is
Olson here?

20
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:40,883
Ozzie, look...

21
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,120
What the fuck
is this?

22
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:43,992
I know it's not my work.
- Ozzie.

23
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:45,428
I'm a great
fucking analyst.

24
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:46,829
Okay, Ozzie.

25
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:51,735
Ozzie, things have not been
going well, as you know.

26
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:54,068
You have
a drinking problem.

27
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,974
I have a drinking problem?

28
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:05,574
This doesn't have
to be unpleasant.

29
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,811
We found something for
you in State. It's a...

30
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:14,190
Well, it is a lower
clearance level. Yes.

31
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:19,425
But it's not...
Look, we're not terminating you.

32
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:20,858
Hmm.

33
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:23,334
This is an assault.

34
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:25,937
I have a drinking problem?

35
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,166
Fuck you, Peck. You're a Mormon!
- Ozzie.

36
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:31,038
Next to you, we all have
a drinking problem!

37
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:36,446
What the fuck is this?
Whose ass didn't I kiss? Huh?

38
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,210
Let's be honest!
- Okay...

39
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:41,310
I mean, let us
be fucking honest.

40
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:45,824
This is a crucifixion!
This is political!

41
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:48,291
And don't tell me it's not!

42
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,624
I have
a drinking problem!

43
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:06,369
You're home.

44
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,712
Honey, hang on to your hat.
I've got some news.

45
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:11,044
Did you pick up
the cheeses?

46
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:12,243
Huh?

47
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:13,783
The cheeses?
Were they ready?

48
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:14,911
The cheeses?

49
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,252
I didn't realize you
could be home so early.

50
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:20,292
Yeah. I left a message for
you to stop by Arnaud's.

51
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:22,122
The Magruders and the Pfarrers
are coming this evening.

52
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:25,391
The Pfarrers...
What did Kathleen say?

53
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:27,191
What?

54
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,962
When you left
the message?

55
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:31,294
That she would
give you the message.

56
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,564
Well, I don't know, I guess
we had bigger news today.

57
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:35,436
My day didn't revolve
around whether...

58
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:37,066
Do you mean that you
didn't pick up the cheeses?

59
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:38,575
Well, if I didn't
get the message,

60
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:39,771
then I didn't pick up
the cheeses.

61
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:41,609
For fuck's sake, Ozzie.
But, honey, hang on to your hat.

62
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:43,672
What, now I have to go and pick them up?
- I have some news to...

63
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,580
Stay here
and get dressed.

64
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:46,983
Honey,
we have to talk.

65
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:51,217
Well, not now. I mean, they're
gonna be here in less than an hour.

66
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:54,625
Is that goat cheese?

67
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:57,390
Chèvre, yes,
that is a goat cheese.

68
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:00,330
'Cause I have a lactose reflux,
and I can't...

69
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,061
You're lactose
intolerant?

70
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:04,136
Yeah, but I...
- Or you have acid reflux?

71
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:06,171
They're different things.
- I know what they are.

72
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:07,534
So you misspoke.

73
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,438
Well, thank you
for correcting me.

74
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:11,807
You should try the chèvre, Harry.
It's very good.

75
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:13,209
Yeah. I can
eat goat cheese.

76
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,474
I was just telling your
husband that I have a condition

77
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:18,381
where I go into
anaphylactic shock when I...

78
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,645
Harry works in the Marshals Service, Doug.
- And my throat...

79
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,654
Oh! I'm on
the legislative side.

80
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:24,952
I work with
Senator Hobby.

81
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:26,992
I was with Treasury, dealing
with Homeland Security.

82
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,322
I'm with the Marshals now.

83
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:30,862
If you want, he'll show
you his great big gun.

84
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:34,962
Very funny.
Gun's no big deal.

85
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:37,562
Twenty years of Marshals Service,
I never discharged my weapon.

86
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:41,204
That sounds like something you
should be telling your psychiatrist.

87
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,708
I don't have
a psychiatrist.

88
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:47,210
Boy, I guess my job
is pretty undramatic.

89
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,407
I'm on
the legislative side.

90
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:50,676
Mrs. Pfarrer,
what do you do?

91
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,876
Do you also
carry a big gun?

92
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,551
No, I write children's...

93
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,349
She writes
children's books.

94
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:59,880
Yeah. <i>Oliver, The Cat</i>
<i>Who Lives In The Rotunda.</i>

95
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,119
Those are wonderful!
- Thank you.

96
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,354
My nieces and nephews
just love them.

97
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:03,861
Oh! Yeah, it's a
beloved, beloved series.

98
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:05,395
Oh! Thank you.

99
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,193
You should see
the fan mail she gets.

100
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:09,091
Are you sure
this is goat cheese?

101
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,670
Why don't you let your wife tell
them about her own books, Harry?

102
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:13,501
Come with me into the kitchen.
- I'm sorry. Was I dominating?

103
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:14,870
Help with
the crudités.

104
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:22,070
God damn it. He knows, doesn't he?
These are nice floors.

105
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:25,014
Knows what?
- About us, he knows about us.

106
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:26,551
Little prick.
- Don't be such an ass.

107
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:28,348
He doesn't know
a thing.

108
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:32,023
What is that, Forbo?

109
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:40,259
What a horse's ass.

110
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:41,993
I don't know why
we see them.

111
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:43,795
Well, she's all right.

112
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:47,436
She's a cold,
stuck-up bitch.

113
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:55,439
You quit?

114
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:56,880
Uh-huh.

115
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:58,246
Well, thank you
for telling me.

116
00:06:58,317 --> 00:06:59,545
Well, I tried to
tell you this...

117
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:00,845
You tried?
You tried?

118
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,854
And then what,
aphasia kicked in?

119
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,913
No. Then our guests
came and then...

120
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:07,788
Why? For fuck's sake, Ozzie.
- I don't know.

121
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,885
I just got so tired.

122
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:11,122
You're tired?

123
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:13,631
Yes, of swimming
against the current.

124
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:15,030
Uh-huh.

125
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,694
Independent thought
is not valued there.

126
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:22,138
They resist it. They fight it.
The bureaucracy is...

127
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:25,176
So they gave you a pension
or severance or something?

128
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:29,009
I didn't retire. I quit.
I don't want their benefits.

129
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,447
But my benefits, they
will do you, right?

130
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:33,815
They'll see you through,
is that the idea?

131
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,989
It's not like that's the
only way to make money.

132
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:39,423
Yes? Yes? Well,
what're you gonna do?

133
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:41,892
I'll do some consulting.

134
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,485
Consulting.

135
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:49,664
Yes, to help out while...
I've always wanted to write.

136
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,638
Write. Write what?

137
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:59,475
I've been thinking
about writing a book.

138
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:03,413
Or, you know,
a sort of memoir.

139
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:18,792
You okay there, Dad?

140
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:31,841
Dad, I left my job
at the Agency.

141
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,710
I'm sorry, Dad.

142
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:47,157
Government service is not the
same as when you were in State.

143
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:49,859
Things are different now.

144
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:55,157
I don't know, maybe it's
the Cold War ending.

145
00:08:57,236 --> 00:09:01,764
Now it seems like it's all
bureaucracy and no mission.

146
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,034
I'm writing a memoir.

147
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:11,911
I think it can be
pretty explosive.

148
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:14,418
But I don't think
you would disapprove.

149
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,988
I don't think you
would disapprove.

150
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,751
Katie's had trouble
accepting it.

151
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:22,191
But sometimes there's
a higher patriotism, Dad.

152
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,078
I know this kind of man.
We've seen this.

153
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,349
Mrs. Cox,
you cannot let this man

154
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,285
take advantage of you,
and he will.

155
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:49,412
He will.

156
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:51,080
Yes. This is my fear.

157
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:53,284
Though he's trying...
Well, he says

158
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,088
he's trying to pull
himself together but...

159
00:09:55,161 --> 00:10:00,861
Yeah. Look, sure, I'm obliged to
tell you to try to salvage things,

160
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,798
and you should.
It's not unheard of

161
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,804
that people turn
themselves around,

162
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:11,969
but you haven't broached the
possibility of divorce yet.

163
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:13,978
No.
- Well, that's good.

164
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:18,244
Because first you should get his
financials before he's forewarned.

165
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:20,342
Because here is a man...

166
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:23,684
Here is a man
practiced in deceit.

167
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:26,224
This was almost,
you could say, it's his job,

168
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,827
and there is no reason
it's not improper.

169
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:34,492
There is no reason you shouldn't get
a picture of the household finances.

170
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:39,197
Paper files, computer files, whatever.
That's your prerogative.

171
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,974
You can be a spy,
too, madam.

172
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:46,711
Do this,
before he's put on alert.

173
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:51,307
Before the turtle can
draw in his head and his...

174
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:54,276
Feet.
- Feet.

175
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:56,787
And hopefully
everything will work out.

176
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:58,517
He will reform.

177
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,820
But if not,

178
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:04,894
forewarned is forearmed.

179
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:17,472
We were young and committed and
there was nothing we could not do.

180
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:21,903
We thought of
the Agency less...

181
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:26,542
Um...

182
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:32,555
The principles
of George Kennan,

183
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:35,660
a personal hero of mine,

184
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:41,089
like the fabled
Murrow's Boys,

185
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:46,731
at a time of...

186
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:59,141
<i>You have reached the Cox Group.</i>

187
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,709
<i>We can't answer</i>
<i>your call right...</i>

188
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:03,482
Hello?

189
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:05,317
<i>I'm looking for Dr. Cox. Is she there?</i>

190
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:10,225
No. She isn't.
Hers is the 5719 number.

191
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:12,230
This is the Cox Group,

192
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:15,961
but you can reach her on her
portable or at her office.

193
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:18,629
<i>She's married!</i>

194
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:20,499
<i>Number four.</i>

195
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:23,536
<i>Has a boyfriend!</i>

196
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:24,870
<i>And number six.</i>

197
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:27,840
<i>She's pregnant!</i>

198
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:13,051
I should try to
get a run in.

199
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:16,554
Ozzie!

200
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:24,501
Ozzie!

201
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:40,578
<i>Let all with one accord rejoice</i>

202
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:44,912
<i>In praise of Old Nassau</i>

203
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:47,680
<i>In praise of Old Nassau,</i>
<i>my boys</i>

204
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:50,755
<i>Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!</i>

205
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:56,921
<i>Her sons will give</i>
<i>while they shall live</i>

206
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:59,829
<i>Three cheers for Old Nassau!</i>

207
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:07,728
We take all the chicken
fat off your buttocks, here.

208
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,398
Mmm-hmm.

209
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:14,943
And the upper arms.
- Mmm-hmm.

210
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:18,450
And a little off your tummy.
- Yeah. Great.

211
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:21,111
Now, we do
breast augmentation

212
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:24,521
with a tiny
incision here...

213
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,082
That marker tickles.

214
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:27,523
...and here.

215
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:30,527
And what about the upper leg,
the higher inside thigh area?

216
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:32,494
Well, we can do
liposuction there, as well,

217
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:34,496
but that area will
respond to exercise.

218
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:38,429
The buttocks and upper
arms begin to store more fat

219
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:42,974
once you get up around 40.
The body just tells it to go there,

220
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:45,738
but the thighs will
respond to toning exercises.

221
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:48,176
Yeah, I can work on my arms
till the cows come home, but...

222
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:51,580
Well, also, there are of
course genetic factors.

223
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:53,151
The Litzkes have
always been big.

224
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:54,242
Well, everyone's got...

225
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,720
My mother had an ass
that could pull a bus.

226
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:58,221
Wow! Well, that's a...

227
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,314
Father's side, too.

228
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:02,087
I mean, although Dad tended to
carry his weight out in front more,

229
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:03,788
in the gut area.
Derrière, not so much.

230
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:04,920
Okay.

231
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:08,296
And what about the face, you know,
the window to the soul?

232
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,628
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

233
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:11,430
Very well put.

234
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:16,201
Well, your eyes are one
of your best features,

235
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:20,744
but we can do something about
the incipient crow's feet.

236
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:22,746
Baby crow's feet.
Little chickling's feet.

237
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:24,577
I mean chicks.
Chickie, chickie, chickie.

238
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:26,981
Yes, again, well put.

239
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:28,986
You have a way
with words.

240
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:32,353
We make a small incision
and then pull the skin tight,

241
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:34,517
like stretching
the skin over a drum.

242
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:35,651
Not too tight, though.

243
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:37,821
We don't want that
"worked-on" look.

244
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:40,364
You need sufficient slack for
the face to remain expressive.

245
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:42,696
Yeah, I don't wanna
look like Boris Karloff.

246
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:44,530
So you don't want a sex change!

247
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:46,365
No, I'm all woman!

248
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:51,542
So, Linda, what we're talking about
here is four different procedures.

249
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:55,446
The liposuction,
the rhinoplasty,

250
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:59,281
the facial tuck, which I would strongly
recommend over the chemical peel.

251
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:00,852
Yeah, I don't wanna
burn anything off.

252
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:03,386
And why should you,
with that lovely skin?

253
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:05,754
And lastly,
the breast augmentation.

254
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:10,261
Now, we can also do something
about the vaccine scar.

255
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:14,193
I don't know if you wear
sleeveless dresses much...

256
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:15,756
Not with these ham hocks!

257
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,928
Yes, well, once they're
nice and svelte, post-op,

258
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:21,631
you may change
your mind about that.

259
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:23,966
I wanna talk about
this vaccine thing.

260
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:25,735
I mean, can you
counsel me on this?

261
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:27,335
I mean, is it
really that unsightly?

262
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:29,414
I see... I mean, a bunch
of people have them.

263
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:31,972
Absolutely!
Some women don't mind it.

264
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:34,311
It's personal taste.

265
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:41,991
Chad!

266
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:44,852
Big breath. Exhale.

267
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:47,292
Hold it.

268
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:48,355
Hold and release!

269
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:49,492
Chad!

270
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:51,799
And release.

271
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:54,632
Too much?

272
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,039
I just felt a straining,
a tightness in the front of my ass.

273
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:00,111
Well, you are pretty
tight down there.

274
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,303
You have to...

275
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:02,574
Yes, something
snapped in my ass.

276
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:04,582
<i>Chad Feldheimer to the office, please.</i>

277
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,174
I'm gonna check with my office.
I'll be right back,

278
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:08,685
and we're gonna work
on opening those hips.

279
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:15,323
I just got a batch
from BeWithMeDC.com.

280
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,588
Oh, no. Anything good?

281
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:19,324
I don't know. I'm just
looking. How do I open this?

282
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,023
Click on the...
Click on the... Yeah...

283
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,793
Okay. Oh, my God!

284
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:24,129
Okay. Loser.

285
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:27,605
Loser. Loser.

286
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:31,206
They should
call this Mr. Loser.com.

287
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,504
Did you have to
send in a picture?

288
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:33,806
No, only the guys do.

289
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,312
I had to fill out
a verbal profile,

290
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:36,914
what turns me on,
what turns me off.

291
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:40,348
I'm really looking for a
guy with a sense of humor.

292
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:42,546
That guy... Wait. That guy wasn't bad.
- Him?

293
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:44,383
No, before.
- Him?

294
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,549
Yeah... He might
not be a loser.

295
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,785
How can you tell?

296
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,657
That's a Brioni suit.
- Yeah?

297
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:51,093
Shit, yeah.

298
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:53,426
Does he look like he would
have a sense of humor?

299
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:55,727
Looks like his optometrist
has a sense of humor.

300
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:57,267
What does he do?

301
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,096
State Department.

302
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:01,771
That's cool.

303
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:04,471
His hair is...
- What is that?

304
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:09,312
Plugs?

305
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:13,545
This is our cardio area, and
we have a lot of machines,

306
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,142
so, believe me,
there's never a wait.

307
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,381
I mean, what you see now
is like our busiest time,

308
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,150
and there's like
a lot of machines open.

309
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:20,282
Hey, Chad.

310
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:22,088
Hey, Linda.
Did you call that guy?

311
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,096
No, not yet.
Chad Feldheimer, he's one of our trainers.

312
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:27,529
I've been doing this Internet
dating thing, and I...

313
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:28,827
What service?

314
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:30,334
BeWithMeDC.com.

315
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:31,993
Nice.
- Have you used them?

316
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:35,596
No. Two friends did, though,
and they both got hooked up

317
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:37,504
with really
special guys.

318
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:39,066
That's fantastic.

319
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:41,546
<i>If you're an English speaker,
please say, "Yes"...</i>

320
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:42,637
Yes!

321
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:44,613
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>I didn't understand what you said.</i>

322
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:46,707
<i>If you're an English speaker...</i>
- English.

323
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:48,776
<i>Would you like to speak to the
billing department or to an agent?</i>

324
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:49,911
Agent.

325
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:51,546
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>I didn't understand what you said.</i>

326
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:54,057
Agent! Agent!

327
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:56,954
<i>Hello.</i>
<i>Can I help you?</i>

328
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:59,257
Yeah, hi.
This is Linda Litzke.

329
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:00,958
Shall I give you
my account number?

330
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:03,499
<i>You keyed it in. I have it here.</i>
- You have it up? Okay.

331
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:06,231
I was told that I needed
pre-approval for these surgeries...

332
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:09,000
<i>Yes, I'm showing that this
procedure was not approved.</i>

333
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:10,768
Yes, it was denied.

334
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:13,709
<i>This operation is an elective procedure.</i>
<i>It's not covered by...</i>

335
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:17,213
No, those are four different operations.
It's very complicated.

336
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:19,341
I'm reinventing myself.
This is a whole new look,

337
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:22,511
so it's not just one thing, but
they're all approved by my doctor.

338
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,612
<i>Your doctor's approval</i>
<i>is not the issue, ma'am.</i>

339
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,487
But this is not... Madam.
<i>Our guidelines specify</i>

340
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,185
<i>that elective</i>
<i>surgeries are...</i>

341
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,922
My job involves
public interface.

342
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:32,793
This is not...
<i>- I'm afraid you don't understand...</i>

343
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:34,593
Oh! I understand.

344
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,929
Put your supervisor
on, please.

345
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:38,965
<i>Hold the line.</i>

346
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,081
Alan?

347
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:28,177
Linda?

348
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:30,113
Yeah.

349
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:38,253
<i>We've been over</i>
<i>and over and over this.</i>

350
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:41,196
<i>First you say you</i>
<i>can't commit, and then...</i>

351
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:42,790
<i>Would you come</i>
<i>down from there?</i>

352
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:30,968
We were married when I
was in my, what, mid-20s?

353
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:32,339
A kid.

354
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:35,141
We were kids, 20s.

355
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:37,647
You think it's forever.

356
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:42,178
You get older, you start
to feel your mortality,

357
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,552
and you say,
"There's no more time for dishonesty,

358
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:48,319
"for subterfuge."
You say, "I'm not that person."

359
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:49,884
The choices you make...

360
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:51,826
I'm thinking of
divorcing Ozzie.

361
00:23:57,869 --> 00:23:59,837
Frankly, I'm thinking...

362
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:06,766
I guess that's what
I should be thinking, too.

363
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:08,709
With Sandy.

364
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,805
Well, that's what
you were just saying.

365
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:12,975
Absolutely, yes.

366
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:14,848
And you're right.
You should dump that bozo.

367
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,115
No question about it.
I agree.

368
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,484
So if I were divorced...

369
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:24,188
Yes, I should settle
things with Sandy

370
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:26,253
because of you and me.
- Mmm-hmm.

371
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:31,164
It's just, you know...

372
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:35,705
It's hard to inflict that
kind of pain, you know.

373
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:39,104
Of course, that would
be easier for you.

374
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:43,377
Why's that?
I don't see that.

375
00:24:43,448 --> 00:24:45,780
Well, because
he's such a dope,

376
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:49,911
and Sandy is a good lady.
She's a very special lady.

377
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:52,218
She's a cold,
stuck-up bitch.

378
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:54,156
That's a little...

379
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:55,988
You and I should
get things sorted.

380
00:24:56,094 --> 00:24:58,255
I've always told you
it's more than just frivolity.

381
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,924
That's right. That's understood.
You've been very straight.

382
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:03,363
And I think I've been
loud and clear.

383
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:04,891
Absolutely.

384
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:08,873
Not just fun and games.

385
00:25:12,377 --> 00:25:13,776
Absolutely.

386
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:35,398
Agent!
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>

387
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:36,991
<i>I didn't understand</i>
<i>what you said.</i>

388
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:38,295
Agent!

389
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:43,665
<i>Your call is important to us.</i>

390
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:46,436
<i> Please stay on the
line for the next available agent.</i>

391
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:59,817
Ted, can I talk to you
about our Mickey Mouse HMO?

392
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:00,915
Uh-huh! Hang on.

393
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,219
This is some
heavy shit.

394
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,557
Is that my date list?

395
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:04,988
No, fuck.

396
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:07,190
You know, I'm trying to reinvent
myself, and these procedures,

397
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:09,529
which are so incredibly not cheap...
- What is that?

398
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:10,794
I can't believe this.

399
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,870
This is like
intelligence shit.

400
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:13,960
I'm not comfortable
with this.

401
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:15,629
This is like...
- What is it?

402
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:17,173
I can't believe
this shit I'm seeing.

403
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:18,742
Manolo found it.
On the floor there.

404
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:21,403
Yeah. Manolo found like this
CD just lying in a locker,

405
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:23,310
a locker floor, ladies' locker.
- Just lying there.

406
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,280
I'm like,
"What, someone's music or what?"

407
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,282
And I come in here,
and it's these files, man.

408
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:28,579
I'm not comfortable
with this.

409
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:32,749
Talking about SIGINT
and signals and shit and...

410
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:33,950
"Signals" means "code,"
you know.

411
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:35,117
It was just lying there.

412
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:38,491
Talking here about department
heads and their names and shit.

413
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:41,760
And then there's these other
files that are just, like, numbers.

414
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:47,465
Arrayed. Numbers and dates and
numbers and number and dates.

415
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,597
And numbers and...

416
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:53,440
I think that's
the shit, man.

417
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,971
The raw intelligence.

418
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,673
I'm not touching this.

419
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:00,011
I want this out of here.

420
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:01,983
Just throw it out?
- No. You can't do that.

421
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,817
You should put up a note
in the ladies' locker room.

422
00:27:03,888 --> 00:27:05,378
Put up a note?

423
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,789
"Highly classified
shit found?"

424
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:10,793
"Signals intelligence shit?
CIA shit?"

425
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:13,955
"Hello! Did anybody lose their secret CIA shit?"
I don't think so.

426
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:15,259
I don't know,
you figure it out,

427
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:16,732
but I'm not comfortable
with this,

428
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:19,065
and I want this
out of Hardbodies.

429
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:21,502
We're running
a gym here. God.

430
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:26,039
Manolo, you didn't find this.

431
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,442
I found it on
the floor there.

432
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:29,971
Yeah, I know, but...

433
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:31,173
Right there on
the floor there.

434
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:33,011
Just lying there.

435
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:00,676
Harry?

436
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:01,971
Yeah, it's me.

437
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,358
Absolut Saketini,
please.

438
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:26,526
Just a Tab.

439
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:28,229
But if I could get
an advance on my salary,

440
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:29,840
I could at least get
the surgery ball rolling.

441
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:32,409
Whoa! There's a payroll
company, you know.

442
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,307
They don't just
advance people money.

443
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:36,243
They just don't do that.

444
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:38,281
I mean, sure, I could say,
"Yes, I authorize it,"

445
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,908
but that's not going to
mean anything to them.

446
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:43,180
Then why do they have us on
this cockamamie health plan?

447
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:44,687
I need those surgeries, Ted.

448
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:46,290
You're a beautiful woman.
You don't...

449
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,882
I have gone just about as far
as I can go with this body.

450
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,121
I think
it's a beautiful...

451
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:53,457
It's not a phony-baloney
Hollywood body.

452
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:56,728
That's right, Ted.
I would be laughed out of Hollywood.

453
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:59,030
I have very limited
breasts, a ginormous ass,

454
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:00,399
and I've got this gut
that swings back and forth

455
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,541
in front of me like a shopping
cart with a bent wheel.

456
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:06,703
You know, there's a lot of guys
that like you just the way you are.

457
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:08,405
Yeah. Losers.

458
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:12,873
I don't know.
I mean, am I a loser? Ted.

459
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:14,919
You know, I wasn't always
a manager at Hardbodies.

460
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:16,680
Let me tell you...

461
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:22,224
Let me show you something.

462
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:29,623
Is that you?

463
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:35,002
Fourteen years, a Greek Orthodox priest.
Congregation in Chevy Chase.

464
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:38,075
That's a good job! What happened?
- Mmm-hmm.

465
00:29:39,844 --> 00:29:41,744
It's a long story.

466
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:45,313
Anyway,

467
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:49,009
in many ways,
I'm a lot happier now.

468
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:51,779
My point is...

469
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:53,756
My point is,
it's a journey.

470
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:55,793
That's my point.
I don't want to stay where I am.

471
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,794
I want to find someone
to share my journey.

472
00:29:57,862 --> 00:30:01,195
Well, you know, sometimes, if you
don't look in your own back yard...

473
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:03,926
I know. That's why I
started this Internet dating.

474
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:07,369
Uh-huh. But what I'm saying is
maybe, you know, you don't have to...

475
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:10,441
Look, Ted, I know that you can't
authorize an advance on my salary,

476
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:13,477
but you could put in
a request, can't you?

477
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:16,336
It's not going to
do any good, Linda.

478
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:20,145
Ted, have you ever heard of
the power of positive thinking?

479
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:31,723
Harry?

480
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,090
It's Monica.

481
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,392
Well, hello.

482
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:47,870
Maybe I can get a run in.

483
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:58,856
Hello?
<i>- Oh, my God.</i>

484
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:05,021
Oh, my God.

485
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,458
Oh, my God.

486
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:11,428
Oh, my God.

487
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:12,797
Do you know
what time it is?

488
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:15,168
Uh-huh. So, like,
I couldn't call you

489
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,537
on your totally
unsecure phone,

490
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:18,769
but I know
who the guy is.

491
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,110
The guy?

492
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,204
The guy, the secret guy.

493
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,812
So, is he high up?

494
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:28,248
I don't know
if he's high up.

495
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:31,083
Probably. I mean,
I got his name, not his rank.

496
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:32,918
So what's his name?

497
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:35,352
Osborne Cox.

498
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:38,061
Never heard of him.

499
00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:39,960
Like you're so plugged into

500
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:41,055
the intelligence community.

501
00:31:41,132 --> 00:31:42,121
I'm just saying
as a layperson...

502
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,567
I think the quality of the
intelligence dictates how high up he is.

503
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,137
Okay.
Not what we know.

504
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:48,637
I also...

505
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,903
Do you have any water?
I gotta hydrate.

506
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:53,204
I got tap water.

507
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,572
Are you kidding?

508
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:56,045
How do you know
who he is?

509
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:57,573
Sources.

510
00:31:57,649 --> 00:31:58,843
What do
you mean sources?

511
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:02,215
You got like Gatorade or anything
besides, like, Maryland swamp water?

512
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:03,584
Do you know how far
this is from my place?

513
00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:05,121
How do you know
his name?

514
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:07,020
I got this geek friend,
Eddie Gallegos.

515
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,355
He does computer stuff,
hooks up people's computers

516
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,725
and programs
their VCRs and shit.

517
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:15,391
So he examines the files and pulls off
the digital watermark, which tells you

518
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:16,865
what computer
it was created on.

519
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:18,434
Fucking child's play
for Eddie.

520
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:19,561
Uh-huh.

521
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:20,865
And...

522
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:24,765
<i>I got his number, I got his number</i>

523
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:25,898
Oh, my God.

524
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:28,001
That was a bit
more difficult.

525
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:29,341
Shall we give him a tinkle?

526
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:30,779
Oh, my God.

527
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:32,810
Why?

528
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:36,444
'Cause he's gonna wanna know
that his shit is secure.

529
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:39,251
He's gonna be relieved.

530
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:42,782
He might even be so relieved
that he gives us a reward.

531
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,987
I would be very fucking
surprised if he did not.

532
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:46,825
Wow.
- Very surprised.

533
00:32:46,931 --> 00:32:49,195
Like, you know,
the Good Samaritan tax,

534
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,736
which is not even a tax,
really, since it's voluntary.

535
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,782
<i>Hello?</i>

536
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:16,084
Osborne?
Osborne Cox?

537
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,752
<i>Yes.</i>

538
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:19,819
<i>Who is this?</i>

539
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:26,597
This...
Is this Osborne Cox?

540
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:30,140
<i>Who is this?</i>
<i>What time is it? Who are you?</i>

541
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:31,266
Um...

542
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:33,310
I'm a Good Samaritan.

543
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:37,314
I'm sorry I'm calling
at such an hour,

544
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:40,579
but I thought you
might be worried.

545
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:42,710
<i>Worried?</i>

546
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:46,917
About the security
of your shit.

547
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:55,064
What on earth are
you talking about?

548
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,698
Who am I speaking to?

549
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:02,094
Your files. Your...
- The documents.

550
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:07,644
I know these documents
are sensitive.

551
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:12,513
But I am perfectly willing to give
back to you your sensitive shit,

552
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:16,145
you know,
at a time of your choosing.

553
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:19,018
<i>What documents are</i>
<i>you talking about?</i>

554
00:34:20,591 --> 00:34:21,580
Osborne Cox?

555
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:23,650
<i> Yes!</i>
<i>Yes, this is...</i>

556
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:26,925
Hello, it's Osborne Cox.
Who the fuck are you?

557
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:29,022
<i>What documents are</i>
<i>you talking about?</i>

558
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,158
<i>Who is that?</i>

559
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:31,496
Okay.

560
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:37,135
"The bureau chief in Belgrade
we all call Slovak the Butcher.

561
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:40,472
"He had very little rapport with
his staff and his dispatches..."

562
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:43,741
Rapport.
"Very little rapport

563
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:46,215
"with his staff,"
fucking moron!

564
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:47,615
<i>How did you get this?</i>

565
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:49,276
Don't blow a gasket,
Osborne.

566
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,978
<i>Who the fuck are you?</i>
<i>Listen to me.</i>

567
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:53,013
We have...
It's not important where...

568
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:54,715
<i>You are in way over</i>
<i>your fucking head!</i>

569
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:56,282
I don't know who
the fuck you are,

570
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,885
but you have no idea
what you're doing!

571
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:02,364
Oh! Why so uptight,
Osborne Cox?

572
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:05,664
I'm just a Good Samaritan,
a traveler on the road...

573
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:06,896
Tell him we're
gonna give it back.

574
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:08,665
We just thought that he
would like to maybe know,

575
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,832
and tell him about that
Good Samaritan tax thing...

576
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,603
Who is that? Hello?
Ozzie, what's going on?

577
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,905
You tell him he's
inconveniencing us.

578
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:16,606
<i>Hello!</i>
<i>Who the fuck is this?</i>

579
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:18,012
<i>Ozzie,</i>
<i>what's going on?</i>

580
00:35:18,082 --> 00:35:21,711
You know, this is a major
inconvenience for us,

581
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:24,880
and we just
thought a reward...

582
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:27,583
<i>So it's money! So it's money!</i>

583
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:28,989
<i>You want money?</i>
<i>Okay. Listen to me.</i>

584
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,527
Well, yeah, why not?

585
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:32,922
Am I out of line here?
<i>- Let me...</i>

586
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:35,225
Listen to me,
you two clowns.

587
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:37,561
Listen to me very,
very carefully.

588
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,971
You have no idea what you're doing,
and I warn you...

589
00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:43,768
You warn us?
You warn us? You warn us?

590
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:45,603
<i>Yes. Yes. I...</i>

591
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:48,236
Let me tell you something, Mr. Intelligence.
<i>- Yes. Let me...</i>

592
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:49,939
We warn you!
<i>- Listen!</i>

593
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:52,073
We will call you back
with our demands!

594
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,242
<i>Hello? Listen to me.</i>

595
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:54,476
Chad! Don't you...

596
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:57,076
No, Chad. Don't play his game!
<i>- Let me explain</i>

597
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,850
<i>how this will work.</i>
- Sorry.

598
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:03,322
Jeez.
The nerve of that guy!

599
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:09,863
I am very fucking surprised
he did not give us that reward.

600
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:12,526
What on earth is going on?

601
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:17,597
Some clown, or two clowns, have
gotten a hold of my memoirs.

602
00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:19,209
Your what?

603
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:21,369
Stolen it, or...
I don't know how...

604
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:22,503
Your what?

605
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:25,014
My memoirs, the book
that I'm writing.

606
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:29,650
Well, why in God's name would
anyone think that's worth anything?

607
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:36,454
It doesn't sound like
he's gonna play ball.

608
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,051
He'll play ball!

609
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,754
We just have to
show him who's boss.

610
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,457
Well, that's...

611
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,993
He sounds very senior.

612
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:45,693
I think this is
some senior guy

613
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,428
who has screwed
the pooch, big-time.

614
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,597
Yeah, that's why
we got him, you know.

615
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,868
We caught him with his thing
caught in a big, fat wringer.

616
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:53,568
Yeah.
And us in the driver's seat.

617
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:54,702
Uh-huh!

618
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:58,009
This is our opportunity.
You don't get many of these.

619
00:36:58,082 --> 00:37:01,108
You slip on the ice outside of,
you know, a fancy restaurant,

620
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:02,981
or something like this happens.
- Right.

621
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,614
And right now
this has happened.

622
00:37:05,656 --> 00:37:07,351
Yup.

623
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:08,949
It sure has.

624
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:15,833
This could put a big
dent in my surgeries.

625
00:37:15,868 --> 00:37:16,959
Uh-huh.

626
00:37:17,868 --> 00:37:19,096
Big time.

627
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,033
Honey! Honey!

628
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,001
Huh?

629
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:29,478
My car is here.
I'm off, mystery man.

630
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,806
What is that thing?

631
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:33,541
It's top secret, baby.

632
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:35,313
How many cities?

633
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:38,651
Seattle, San Francisco,
Los Angeles, Chicago.

634
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:40,486
Why do they always
send you to Seattle?

635
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:41,616
It's not a big market.

636
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:43,660
I don't know. Lots of
independent bookstores.

637
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:45,855
Rains all the time.
What else are people gonna do?

638
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,090
I can think of
a couple of things.

639
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:49,155
You can think of one thing.

640
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,291
Where are they
putting you?

641
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:51,390
Christ, it better
be the Peninsula,

642
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:53,435
the money I make for them.

643
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:55,463
Are you gonna be okay?

644
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:56,904
I'll be sad,
but I'll be okay.

645
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:58,202
Not too sad.

646
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,607
Just the right amount.

647
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:04,310
I am crazy about you, baby.

648
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:27,997
Hey!

649
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:43,287
Tony Bennett, Toni Morrison,

650
00:38:43,322 --> 00:38:46,956
Zoe Caldwell.
It was marvelous.

651
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:50,051
First time I've ever
attended the Kennedy Honors.

652
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:51,754
Jane Alexander
is a client,

653
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:54,059
an old friend of Zoe's.

654
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:55,462
Anyway...

655
00:38:57,868 --> 00:38:59,563
Connie.
- Yes, sir.

656
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:03,071
<i> Would you bring in your
copy of the Cox financials?</i>

657
00:39:05,743 --> 00:39:09,975
<i>Tony sang</i>
The Best is Yet to Come.

658
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:11,139
<i>Tony Bennett.</i>

659
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:16,685
I thought I had it
here on a disk.

660
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:18,085
I don't know
where the disk is.

661
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:21,386
I'm sorry, I'll have to run
another off my hard drive.

662
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:22,756
All right. Okay.

663
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:24,988
So we've drawn up the papers,

664
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:30,056
and we are prepared to execute service
on Osborne, if you so elect, Mrs. Cox.

665
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:33,295
But since we are at
the point of no return,

666
00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:36,702
I always urge my clients
in this juncture

667
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:40,937
to give it one more
day of reflection.

668
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:14,174
Harry?

669
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:17,237
It's Linda.

670
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:20,248
Well, hello.

671
00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:23,982
I did the whole
bodyguard thing for years.

672
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:26,918
My guy was in State, the
Secretary as a matter of fact,

673
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:29,221
so I did a lot
of traveling.

674
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:32,352
"Ironside has left the building."
We called him Iron Ass.

675
00:40:32,463 --> 00:40:33,589
Not to his face,
of course.

676
00:40:33,664 --> 00:40:34,961
Not to his ass, either!

677
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,460
He was okay.

678
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:38,626
Personal protection's
a young man's game.

679
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:39,896
These are really good.
You wanna try one?

680
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:42,665
Yeah? Does that have
shell food in it?

681
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:45,171
Shell food?
- I got a sensitivity.

682
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:46,675
I go into
anaphylactic shock.

683
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:49,679
My larynx swells up and it closes...
What the hell.

684
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:51,408
Live dangerously, huh?

685
00:40:52,183 --> 00:40:53,878
Can't always wear a condom,
right?

686
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:55,747
That's right! Not always!

687
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,549
Yeah. My job now is
mostly administrative.

688
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:02,521
Not so much PP,
personal protection.

689
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,618
I do still
carry the gun.

690
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:04,889
Oh, my God.

691
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:07,055
No big deal.
Never discharged it

692
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:09,325
in 20 years of service.
Security blanket now.

693
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,095
I don't even think about it.
Of course,

694
00:41:11,502 --> 00:41:12,969
you're not supposed
to think about it.

695
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:15,698
In a situation where your man is
threatened, the training kicks in.

696
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,707
It's muscle memory.
Just like that. It's reflexes. It's...

697
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:20,710
Those are outrageous.
You wanna swap?

698
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:22,302
No way!

699
00:41:22,379 --> 00:41:24,108
Go away. Go away.
Let me touch.

700
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:25,375
Okay. Saki?

701
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:29,051
There was a hell of a lot
of political infighting

702
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,553
and petty, petty shit,
and then basically

703
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:33,522
the old man stepped
on Geiberger's throat.

704
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:36,082
This is nice.
Is this wide-plank pine?

705
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,889
Yeah. I guess so.

706
00:41:38,562 --> 00:41:39,586
Yeah.

707
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:42,257
Listen, Linda,
full disclosure here.

708
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:44,857
Yes, I am not wearing a
wedding ring, but I am married.

709
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:45,993
Hmm.

710
00:41:46,103 --> 00:41:49,504
I took the ring off about 18 months
ago when we agreed to separate,

711
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:50,972
we agreed to disagree.

712
00:41:51,075 --> 00:41:52,770
That's about the only
thing we ever agreed on.

713
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:56,772
Well, thanks for telling me, Harry.
I really appreciate it.

714
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:59,577
You know,
full transparency is my MO.

715
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:03,443
That's not gonna
go off, is it?

716
00:42:03,487 --> 00:42:06,456
Well, let's get in the
other room and find out.

717
00:42:18,135 --> 00:42:19,864
That's great.
That's exciting.

718
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,766
Yeah. He's very,
very communicative.

719
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:24,238
Very accessible.
He has a sense of humor,

720
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:26,276
and he agrees 100%
about my surgeries.

721
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:27,434
Well...

722
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:28,636
He agrees my ass
could be smaller.

723
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:30,270
I mean,
not in a mean way.

724
00:42:30,347 --> 00:42:32,406
It comes from
a place of humor.

725
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:37,147
That's good, but, Linda, what do
you really know about this guy?

726
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:39,279
I told you, he's in
the Treasury Department.

727
00:42:39,356 --> 00:42:41,517
But, no, I mean...

728
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:44,753
You know, he could be one of these
guys that cruises the Internet.

729
00:42:44,828 --> 00:42:46,420
Yeah, so am I.

730
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:50,290
What's wrong
with this?

731
00:42:50,367 --> 00:42:52,062
No, you cannot
wear that.

732
00:42:52,169 --> 00:42:53,363
You have to
wear a suit.

733
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:55,631
You mean,
go home and change?

734
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,229
Yeah!

735
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:00,470
I was gonna
ride my bike.

736
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:48,252
Osborne Cox.

737
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:54,487
And you, I take it,
are Mr. Black.

738
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:56,795
Yes, I am.

739
00:43:57,401 --> 00:43:59,369
You have the money?

740
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,271
$50,000.

741
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:06,776
That's what was agreed
upon, Osborne Cox.

742
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:12,040
All right. Let me explain
something to you, Mr. Black.

743
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:15,141
You know who I am,
I know who you are.

744
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:16,481
Perhaps,

745
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:20,920
but appearances
can be deceptive.

746
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:22,557
Yeah.

747
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:27,097
What you're engaged in is blackmail.
That is a felony.

748
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:28,926
That's for starters.

749
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:30,829
Appearances
can be deceptive.

750
00:44:32,036 --> 00:44:34,664
I am a mere
Good Samaritan who...

751
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:38,208
Secondly, the
unauthorized dissemination

752
00:44:38,275 --> 00:44:42,678
of classified material
is a federal crime.

753
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:45,374
If you ever carried out
your proposed threat,

754
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:51,012
you would experience such a shit
storm of consequences, my friend,

755
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:54,387
that your empty little head
would be spinning

756
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:57,916
faster than the wheels of your
Schwinn bicycle back there.

757
00:44:58,028 --> 00:44:59,518
You think
that's a Schwinn.

758
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:03,623
Now give me the
fucking floppy or the CD

759
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:05,965
or whatever the fuck it is...

760
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:09,164
As soon as you give
us the money, dickwad!

761
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:16,372
You fuck!

762
00:45:16,513 --> 00:45:17,673
Give it to me, fuck!

763
00:45:17,748 --> 00:45:21,445
You fucker.
I know who you are, fucker!

764
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:23,383
You're the fucker!

765
00:45:27,024 --> 00:45:29,254
Where's the money?
- He hit me!

766
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:31,020
Where's the money?

767
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:32,888
He didn't give it to me.

768
00:45:32,963 --> 00:45:35,056
For... Get in the car.
Get in the car.

769
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:47,740
What are
you doing? Shit!

770
00:45:51,648 --> 00:45:55,812
Fuck it!
Fuck! Fucking lunatic!

771
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:59,749
You fucking morons!

772
00:45:59,823 --> 00:46:00,847
Dick!

773
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:04,417
That'll give him something to think about.
- Yeah.

774
00:46:04,461 --> 00:46:05,587
I knew this
would happen.

775
00:46:05,629 --> 00:46:06,687
Wait. Wait!
We gotta go back!

776
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:07,753
My bike!

777
00:46:07,831 --> 00:46:08,957
It's on to Plan B.

778
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:12,794
That's just a Kryptonite lock.
You can open those fuckers with a Bic pen!

779
00:46:13,237 --> 00:46:14,704
Some people.

780
00:46:20,344 --> 00:46:21,368
What is this?

781
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:22,570
Russian Embassy.

782
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:28,113
I told Mr. Krapotkin
I might be stopping by.

783
00:46:29,086 --> 00:46:30,986
Is there a men's room?

784
00:46:39,429 --> 00:46:41,920
Madam,
you are mistaken.

785
00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:45,091
I am assistant
cultural attaché.

786
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:48,469
The organs of state security
are not allowed to function

787
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:50,131
within the borders
of your country.

788
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:52,602
Organs?

789
00:46:53,577 --> 00:46:54,635
Yes.

790
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:00,411
But what if I had, say,
secrets of a highly...

791
00:47:01,185 --> 00:47:04,211
Secrets that might interest
the organs of the...

792
00:47:06,023 --> 00:47:07,081
Yes?

793
00:47:13,096 --> 00:47:14,757
That's just a taste.

794
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,304
May I ask the source
of this material?

795
00:47:28,378 --> 00:47:29,402
No, you may not.

796
00:47:29,479 --> 00:47:31,470
He's very high up.
- Chad!

797
00:47:31,548 --> 00:47:33,573
What?
I'm just saying he's high up.

798
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:41,014
PC or Mac?

799
00:47:41,091 --> 00:47:42,183
PC.
PC.

800
00:47:43,827 --> 00:47:44,987
Could you wait, please?

801
00:47:45,062 --> 00:47:46,256
I do have a date.

802
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:52,390
Hey!

803
00:47:58,075 --> 00:48:00,635
The fish has bitten.

804
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:02,204
Huh?

805
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:04,675
Yeah, he seems cool.

806
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:08,742
<i>Chad.</i>

807
00:48:16,927 --> 00:48:19,259
Could you accompany me, please?

808
00:48:32,376 --> 00:48:33,707
There is more material?

809
00:48:33,777 --> 00:48:35,142
There's a lot more.

810
00:48:35,279 --> 00:48:37,270
But we want to
be paid first.

811
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:40,913
You are not ideological?

812
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:44,778
I don't think so.

813
00:48:44,855 --> 00:48:47,346
Look, I have
a date, so...

814
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:52,386
Date.

815
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:56,823
Uh-oh.

816
00:48:58,001 --> 00:49:00,868
A line to check in, towels piling up.
I'm sorry, Ted.

817
00:49:01,004 --> 00:49:03,234
And Manolo running
around like crazy.

818
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:05,036
What happened to your nose?

819
00:49:05,075 --> 00:49:06,702
This is not acceptable
at Hardbodies.

820
00:49:07,311 --> 00:49:08,505
You two know
better than that.

821
00:49:08,578 --> 00:49:10,205
Yes, we do, Ted.
I'm really sorry.

822
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,372
This is no way...

823
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:13,848
It was unavoidable, Ted.
It won't happen again.

824
00:49:13,917 --> 00:49:15,043
But you won't tell me
what's going on.

825
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:16,415
No, we can't.

826
00:49:18,355 --> 00:49:19,720
I know this is
really terrible, Ted,

827
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:23,191
but I have to go.
I have a date.

828
00:49:26,096 --> 00:49:30,556
You're changing, Linda.
It's very sad.

829
00:49:40,777 --> 00:49:44,178
Which, to my mind, is all the more
reason to lower the boom on Ozzie.

830
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:45,812
Mmm-hmm.

831
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:48,613
Is that it? "Mmm-hmm"?

832
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:52,614
I'm wondering if it's
the right time and...

833
00:49:52,689 --> 00:49:54,122
Well, of course
it's the right time.

834
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:56,022
Why wouldn't it
be the right time?

835
00:49:56,626 --> 00:49:58,025
Does this threaten you?
- No.

836
00:49:58,128 --> 00:49:59,959
You and me,
we're rock solid.

837
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:03,428
It's just, I think that's
why we can afford to be big.

838
00:50:04,067 --> 00:50:06,262
We can think about Ozzie and
whether we give him a chance to

839
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:07,530
get himself together
a little bit,

840
00:50:07,637 --> 00:50:08,763
before you hammer
the hell out of him.

841
00:50:08,872 --> 00:50:11,534
Is that how you see me? Hammering him?
- Of course not...

842
00:50:11,641 --> 00:50:12,972
No, but that was your word.
- Yeah.

843
00:50:13,043 --> 00:50:15,705
I don't hammer.
- No, of course not. Listen,

844
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:17,478
I'm no friend of the guy,
you know that.

845
00:50:17,614 --> 00:50:19,013
I think he's an
arrogant little geek.

846
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:22,549
But, you know, we have
all the time in the world,

847
00:50:22,652 --> 00:50:23,983
and he just lost his job.

848
00:50:24,054 --> 00:50:25,954
He didn't lose it.
He quit.

849
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:29,220
Yeah, well, most of the people
in this town who quit, were fired.

850
00:50:29,659 --> 00:50:31,490
I feel sorry for him,

851
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:35,923
and I think he'll be a lot easier to
deal with if he doesn't feel cornered.

852
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:43,332
Maybe. Just as long as we're
talking about Ozzie here, not you.

853
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,067
Of course we're
talking about Ozzie.

854
00:50:46,343 --> 00:50:48,675
I'll do whatever you want, baby.
I adore you.

855
00:50:53,183 --> 00:50:55,117
You get the check.
- Okay.

856
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:59,588
Yeah. Yes.
Is there blood in his stool?

857
00:51:00,624 --> 00:51:02,091
Later.
I'm running home.

858
00:51:05,362 --> 00:51:06,693
I love you, baby.

859
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:17,839
Ozzie?

860
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:23,440
God damn it, Ozzie, what
have you done to the car?

861
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:29,082
All right. All right.

862
00:51:46,636 --> 00:51:48,160
Oh, my God,
am I really late?

863
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:51,138
No, no.
It doesn't start for five minutes.

864
00:51:52,642 --> 00:51:54,075
You haven't seen
this yet, have you?

865
00:51:54,211 --> 00:51:55,678
This one, no.
No, I have not.

866
00:51:55,745 --> 00:51:56,734
I hear it's terrific.

867
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:57,904
Great.

868
00:51:58,982 --> 00:52:01,644
<i>We've been over</i>
<i>and over and over this.</i>

869
00:52:01,818 --> 00:52:04,685
<i>First you say you</i>
<i>can't commit, and then...</i>

870
00:52:04,721 --> 00:52:06,188
<i>Would you come</i>
<i>down from there?</i>

871
00:52:14,598 --> 00:52:18,432
Pardon our dust, the ex is
in the process of moving out.

872
00:52:19,035 --> 00:52:20,969
I told her to
expedite things, but...

873
00:52:21,037 --> 00:52:22,061
Yeah.

874
00:52:22,172 --> 00:52:24,003
Yeah, you know, you try
to act like an adult.

875
00:52:24,074 --> 00:52:25,439
Well,
it's never easy.

876
00:52:25,509 --> 00:52:26,635
Hmm.

877
00:52:27,177 --> 00:52:29,873
You wanna come downstairs?
You like surprises?

878
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:32,346
Well, I'm always open
to new experiences.

879
00:52:32,415 --> 00:52:35,509
I gotta tell you, I saw an ad for
this in a gentleman's magazine,

880
00:52:35,585 --> 00:52:39,521
1,200 bucks. 1,200 bucks.
I'm looking at this thing and I think,

881
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:42,319
"Jesus, you gotta be kidding me.
I'm a hobbyist.

882
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:45,325
"This thing's basically
nothing but Speed-Rail."

883
00:52:45,395 --> 00:52:47,295
I figure I'd go down
to Home Depot

884
00:52:47,364 --> 00:52:49,594
and whip this up myself
for 100 bucks.

885
00:52:50,734 --> 00:52:51,792
What is it?

886
00:52:51,902 --> 00:52:52,926
What is it?

887
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:57,301
You sit down there,
make yourself comfortable,

888
00:52:57,941 --> 00:53:01,172
put your feet in
the stirrups and...

889
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:08,181
Oh, my God!

890
00:53:13,323 --> 00:53:14,813
That's fantastic!

891
00:53:14,925 --> 00:53:16,552
Something, isn't it?
100 bucks all in.

892
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:19,595
Not counting my labor
and the cost of the dildo.

893
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:21,391
Those things aren't cheap.
- Uh-huh!

894
00:53:21,498 --> 00:53:24,524
See, I lack that.
I'm not set up to mold hard rubber.

895
00:53:27,637 --> 00:53:30,037
The Russians? The Russians?
- Uh-huh.

896
00:53:30,106 --> 00:53:31,403
Mmm-hmm.

897
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:33,369
The Russian Embassy, yeah.

898
00:53:34,177 --> 00:53:35,201
Are you sure?

899
00:53:35,278 --> 00:53:38,406
Hey, the guy was not hard
to follow, as you know.

900
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:43,652
Why the fuck would they go to the Russians?
Why the fuck?

901
00:53:46,823 --> 00:53:48,688
I'm sorry.
Thank you, Hal.

902
00:53:49,259 --> 00:53:51,159
Hey. No problemo.

903
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:56,991
Look, Ozzie, I hate to be
the paranoid old spook,

904
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:59,967
but those two guys seem
very interested in you.

905
00:54:03,473 --> 00:54:05,805
You haven't gone poofy
on me, have you, Oz?

906
00:54:09,312 --> 00:54:10,779
Can I help you?

907
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:12,404
I'm sorry
if I was staring,

908
00:54:12,482 --> 00:54:14,143
but your face
looks familiar.

909
00:54:14,217 --> 00:54:16,651
It's Princeton? '73?

910
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:17,778
Yeah.

911
00:54:17,854 --> 00:54:19,219
I can't remember
your name.

912
00:54:19,289 --> 00:54:20,517
Osborne Cox.

913
00:54:20,657 --> 00:54:21,919
I thought so.

914
00:54:21,992 --> 00:54:24,051
Served and witnessed.

915
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:26,623
You have a real
nice evening.

916
00:54:29,399 --> 00:54:30,423
Ouch.

917
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:46,041
What the fuck?

918
00:54:52,322 --> 00:54:55,723
Fuck! What the fuck?

919
00:55:08,004 --> 00:55:09,767
Fuck! Fucking...

920
00:55:15,712 --> 00:55:17,441
Why did you tell him
we could get more stuff?

921
00:55:17,514 --> 00:55:19,106
Well, maybe we can.

922
00:55:19,182 --> 00:55:21,946
That's all Manolo found.
That was everything.

923
00:55:22,018 --> 00:55:24,179
What, are we
gonna tell Manolo

924
00:55:24,287 --> 00:55:26,517
to scoop some more secret
spy shit off the locker floor?

925
00:55:26,623 --> 00:55:27,681
Hey!
- What?

926
00:55:27,791 --> 00:55:30,282
I don't like the snideness,
nor the negativity.

927
00:55:30,894 --> 00:55:33,124
I'm sorry. I'm just
trying to work this thing.

928
00:55:33,196 --> 00:55:35,027
If I'm gonna reinvent myself,
I need these surgeries,

929
00:55:35,098 --> 00:55:36,292
and these surgeries
cost money.

930
00:55:36,366 --> 00:55:38,334
And this is not just
fun and games. I'm sorry.

931
00:55:38,435 --> 00:55:40,198
So let's figure
this thing out, okay?

932
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:42,362
<i>Chad,</i>
<i>your Berry Blast is ready.</i>

933
00:55:42,572 --> 00:55:44,096
We know who he is.

934
00:55:44,274 --> 00:55:45,798
Right, Osborne Cox.

935
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:48,434
So we can find out
where he lives, right?

936
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:49,842
I guess.

937
00:55:49,913 --> 00:55:52,438
You should change into a suit.
- Why?

938
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:54,210
So you don't stand out
in his neighborhood.

939
00:55:54,284 --> 00:55:55,342
There are certain
elemental things, Chad.

940
00:55:55,418 --> 00:55:56,442
His neighborhood?

941
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:59,352
Yes. We should take out the
labels and the laundry marks.

942
00:55:59,422 --> 00:56:00,719
Laundry marks?

943
00:56:00,924 --> 00:56:02,289
Deniability.

944
00:56:05,495 --> 00:56:07,122
<i>Shake it down</i>

945
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:12,728
<i>Shakes right</i>

946
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:35,243
What's the odometer say?

947
00:58:36,212 --> 00:58:37,270
Five.

948
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:39,474
About five or approximately five?
I mean...

949
00:58:39,616 --> 00:58:41,743
For fuck's sake, Harry,
it's five miles.

950
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:43,383
5.2.

951
00:58:43,453 --> 00:58:45,648
Okay. I gotta do
at least five.

952
00:58:45,722 --> 00:58:47,314
Five and a deuce is okay.

953
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:49,358
I'm amazed you
have the energy.

954
00:58:49,425 --> 00:58:51,723
You kidding? Pull around the
corner and we'll do it in the back.

955
00:58:51,828 --> 00:58:53,557
You're so coarse.

956
00:58:53,663 --> 00:58:55,995
No. Back of the car,
not a rear entry situation.

957
00:58:56,065 --> 00:58:58,499
Fuck! I'm late.

958
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:14,855
Hello?

959
01:04:05,575 --> 01:04:08,738
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

960
01:04:33,736 --> 01:04:36,864
Oh, my God.
What the fuck?

961
01:04:42,411 --> 01:04:43,935
What the fuck?

962
01:04:51,954 --> 01:04:55,287
What the fuck? Nothing?

963
01:04:56,859 --> 01:04:57,951
Oh!

964
01:04:58,027 --> 01:05:03,226
Oh, my fuck.
I killed a fucking spook.

965
01:05:05,101 --> 01:05:08,798
What the fuck are you doing
here, you fucker? You...

966
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:30,681
Olson, what's up?

967
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:45,597
Palmer, what's up?

968
01:05:45,708 --> 01:05:50,111
Not quite certain,
sir, but it's messy.

969
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,840
Kolyma Two tells us
they have computer files

970
01:05:53,916 --> 01:05:57,147
from an ex-analyst
of mine, Osborne Cox.

971
01:05:57,219 --> 01:05:58,345
Kolyma Two?

972
01:05:58,421 --> 01:05:59,445
Our man in
the Russian Embassy.

973
01:05:59,522 --> 01:06:00,454
Hmm.

974
01:06:00,589 --> 01:06:03,023
They were brought in
to them by a woman...

975
01:06:03,092 --> 01:06:04,252
The Russians?

976
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:09,458
Yeah. It was brought in by
a woman named Linda Litzke,

977
01:06:09,699 --> 01:06:11,667
an associate of a guy
named Harry Pfarrer.

978
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:13,792
Picture's in the file,
with Pfarrer's.

979
01:06:13,903 --> 01:06:15,336
The Russians?
- Yeah.

980
01:06:17,907 --> 01:06:19,272
And who's Pfarrer?

981
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:25,776
Treasury guy who has
been screwing Mrs. Cox.

982
01:06:25,881 --> 01:06:27,542
That must be how
they got the files.

983
01:06:27,683 --> 01:06:30,015
Or maybe Ozzie
knows about them.

984
01:06:30,086 --> 01:06:31,713
They all seem to be
sleeping with each other.

985
01:06:31,787 --> 01:06:32,879
All right. Spare me.

986
01:06:32,955 --> 01:06:35,549
Yes, sir,
but this Treasury guy,

987
01:06:36,792 --> 01:06:40,523
it's become complicated.

988
01:06:42,865 --> 01:06:46,767
He just shot somebody
in Ozzie's house.

989
01:06:47,903 --> 01:06:50,098
Shot your analyst?

990
01:06:50,206 --> 01:06:51,901
No, Ozzie wasn't there.

991
01:06:52,108 --> 01:06:55,202
Our man surveilling
hears a gunshot,

992
01:06:55,277 --> 01:06:57,074
sees the guy
wrestle something

993
01:06:57,146 --> 01:06:59,580
into his car. Follows him.

994
01:06:59,648 --> 01:07:02,048
He dumps a body in
the Chesapeake Bay.

995
01:07:02,785 --> 01:07:04,412
Well, what'd he do that for?

996
01:07:04,453 --> 01:07:05,545
Don't know, sir.

997
01:07:05,588 --> 01:07:07,055
For Christ sake, did
anyone fish the body out?

998
01:07:07,123 --> 01:07:08,181
Mmm-hmm.

999
01:07:08,257 --> 01:07:09,622
And Russian? American?

1000
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:11,353
Don't know.
Scrubbed of ID.

1001
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:14,659
And this Linda...

1002
01:07:14,730 --> 01:07:16,197
Linda Litzke.

1003
01:07:16,265 --> 01:07:17,664
Yeah, she's Treasury?

1004
01:07:18,134 --> 01:07:19,158
No.

1005
01:07:19,268 --> 01:07:23,102
We're fuzzy on her.

1006
01:07:24,774 --> 01:07:27,743
So we don't really know
what anyone is after.

1007
01:07:28,244 --> 01:07:29,438
Not really, sir.

1008
01:07:30,413 --> 01:07:33,382
And this analyst,
ex-analyst...

1009
01:07:33,449 --> 01:07:35,007
Cox.

1010
01:07:35,084 --> 01:07:37,644
Yeah. What's his
clearance level?

1011
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:39,449
Three.

1012
01:07:39,922 --> 01:07:41,753
Okay, no biggie.

1013
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:45,791
Just, for now, just keep an eye
on everyone, see what they do.

1014
01:07:45,861 --> 01:07:50,525
Yes, sir. And we'll interface
with the FBI on this dead body.

1015
01:07:50,633 --> 01:07:53,796
No! No. God, no. We don't want
those idiots bumbling around in this.

1016
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:55,666
Burn the body.
Get rid of it.

1017
01:07:55,771 --> 01:07:59,537
And keep an eye on
everyone, see what they do.

1018
01:08:00,309 --> 01:08:02,709
Report back to me when...

1019
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:07,248
I don't know,
when it makes sense.

1020
01:08:10,986 --> 01:08:12,010
<i>Go!</i>

1021
01:08:12,421 --> 01:08:15,322
<i>And tap. Up, up and tap!</i>

1022
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:16,550
<i>Up, up and tap.</i>

1023
01:08:16,692 --> 01:08:17,852
I'm bigger.
I'm bigger.

1024
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:19,587
<i>Now let's add the arms,</i>
<i>right here.</i>

1025
01:08:19,728 --> 01:08:21,355
I'm bigger than ever.

1026
01:08:21,464 --> 01:08:23,295
<i>Up, up, again.</i>
<i>And again.</i>

1027
01:08:23,432 --> 01:08:25,297
I'm bigger. I'm back.
I'm better. I'm back.

1028
01:08:25,401 --> 01:08:27,301
Than ever. I'm back.
<i>- Let's do it again. Come on.</i>

1029
01:08:27,369 --> 01:08:28,393
You fuckers, I'm back.

1030
01:08:28,504 --> 01:08:29,562
<i>Up, up, down, down.</i>

1031
01:08:29,672 --> 01:08:30,730
You fuckers, I'm back.

1032
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:31,864
<i>Up, up, down, down, up!</i>

1033
01:08:32,475 --> 01:08:34,033
<i>And last time...</i>

1034
01:08:43,752 --> 01:08:45,777
Linda. You okay?

1035
01:08:45,921 --> 01:08:47,980
Yeah, I'm fine, Ted. I'm sorry.

1036
01:08:48,491 --> 01:08:49,583
You don't look fine.

1037
01:08:49,658 --> 01:08:50,750
No, no, I'm...

1038
01:08:52,094 --> 01:08:53,925
But you won't
tell me what's wrong.

1039
01:08:54,763 --> 01:08:56,594
You never let me in, Linda.

1040
01:08:56,665 --> 01:08:58,997
I know you're trustworthy.
I just...

1041
01:08:59,101 --> 01:09:01,501
I don't want to endanger other people.
I mean...

1042
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:04,970
This is the path that I've chosen.
It's not...

1043
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:08,407
You have to isolate,
you know, a firewall.

1044
01:09:10,212 --> 01:09:12,874
Well, I don't know
what to think.

1045
01:09:12,948 --> 01:09:14,415
You both go AWOL on Friday.

1046
01:09:14,483 --> 01:09:16,383
And today Chad doesn't even
bother to come in at all.

1047
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:18,510
I know, Ted.
I can't run a gym this way.

1048
01:09:18,587 --> 01:09:20,350
I know, Ted.
I'm going to have to fire him.

1049
01:09:20,422 --> 01:09:21,753
No, no, no.
Ted, just...

1050
01:09:21,857 --> 01:09:23,222
What?

1051
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:24,758
Give me 24 hours!

1052
01:09:25,494 --> 01:09:28,529
To what?
- I don't know. Just give me 24 hours!

1053
01:09:28,564 --> 01:09:31,260
Linda...
- Just give me 24 hours to solve this thing.

1054
01:09:34,136 --> 01:09:36,104
Linda, I have to tell you.

1055
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:38,663
A man was in here earlier,
asking about you.

1056
01:09:38,774 --> 01:09:41,072
Are you in some
kind of trouble?

1057
01:09:41,143 --> 01:09:42,804
Is Chad running away
from something?

1058
01:09:42,878 --> 01:09:45,210
We know what we're doing, Ted.
- Let me ask you this,

1059
01:09:45,281 --> 01:09:47,306
did he know my name?

1060
01:09:47,716 --> 01:09:49,308
Well, yes, he was asking about you.

1061
01:09:49,385 --> 01:09:51,546
Employment history,
etcetera. Real jerk.

1062
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:52,814
I told him to get lost.

1063
01:09:52,922 --> 01:09:54,150
Thank you, Ted.

1064
01:09:56,659 --> 01:10:00,459
Well, we just don't give
that out at Hardbodies.

1065
01:10:00,596 --> 01:10:02,291
<i>Linda, a Mr. Krapotkin on line two.</i>

1066
01:10:02,398 --> 01:10:03,422
Oh, my God.

1067
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:08,261
Mr. Krapotkin?

1068
01:10:08,437 --> 01:10:09,495
<i>This Linda?</i>

1069
01:10:09,638 --> 01:10:10,627
Yes?

1070
01:10:10,773 --> 01:10:14,470
<i>Yes, this is Ilan Krapotkin, in the
Russian Embassy, returning your call.</i>

1071
01:10:14,543 --> 01:10:17,512
Yes, yes! Hang on.
I'm sorry, Ted. This is private.

1072
01:10:24,787 --> 01:10:28,120
Mr. Krapotkin? Is this a secure line?
<i>- Yes?</i>

1073
01:10:28,190 --> 01:10:29,885
<i></i>

1074
01:10:29,992 --> 01:10:31,687
Mr. Krapotkin?
Is this a secure...

1075
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:32,784
<i>Are you joking?</i>

1076
01:10:32,861 --> 01:10:37,821
No! I'm very worried about
my associate, you know, Chad.

1077
01:10:39,168 --> 01:10:40,567
Do you have him?
<i>- Do we have him?</i>

1078
01:10:42,004 --> 01:10:43,904
Is he... Was he...
Well, I don't know what the term is.

1079
01:10:43,973 --> 01:10:45,099
Did he go over?

1080
01:10:45,207 --> 01:10:49,007
<i>I don't understand.</i>
<i>Is he not at Hardbodies?</i>

1081
01:10:49,445 --> 01:10:55,179
No. Look, could I come
in and discuss this?

1082
01:10:57,219 --> 01:10:59,187
<i>I'm very busy</i>
<i>at the moment.</i>

1083
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:00,313
I'm coming anyway.

1084
01:11:17,006 --> 01:11:18,997
You seem distracted.

1085
01:11:20,442 --> 01:11:22,137
Do I?

1086
01:11:22,211 --> 01:11:24,406
Very distracted.
The last few days.

1087
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:28,310
Work.

1088
01:11:30,185 --> 01:11:32,016
You think that might
be enough carrots?

1089
01:11:35,024 --> 01:11:36,150
What?

1090
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:37,418
For the salad.

1091
01:11:42,097 --> 01:11:44,793
You know, you really
are a negative person.

1092
01:11:46,335 --> 01:11:47,324
What?

1093
01:11:47,436 --> 01:11:49,199
I've tried to ignore it,

1094
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:51,034
to remain upbeat.

1095
01:11:51,106 --> 01:11:53,370
Harry,
stop the foolishness.

1096
01:11:53,442 --> 01:11:55,740
Stop the foolishness?
- Yes, and behave.

1097
01:11:55,811 --> 01:11:59,440
You are not speaking to one
of your "shithole buddies."

1098
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:55,796
<i>Hello?</i>

1099
01:12:56,305 --> 01:12:59,240
Honey, it's so good
to hear your voice.

1100
01:12:59,308 --> 01:13:00,400
<i>Is something wrong,</i>
<i>Harry?</i>

1101
01:13:00,542 --> 01:13:06,481
No. Yeah. Can you come
home? Baby needs you.

1102
01:13:06,949 --> 01:13:08,246
Can you please come home?

1103
01:13:08,317 --> 01:13:11,844
<i>Harry, you know I can't
just leave the book tour.</i>

1104
01:13:12,254 --> 01:13:13,915
I can show you your present.
It's finished.

1105
01:13:13,989 --> 01:13:17,584
<i>Harry, I can't just leave.</i>
<i>There are two days left.</i>

1106
01:13:17,693 --> 01:13:19,490
<i>There's still Seattle.</i>

1107
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:23,062
Yeah.

1108
01:13:23,198 --> 01:13:24,631
<i>I love you, Harry.</i>

1109
01:13:25,501 --> 01:13:28,959
Yeah. I love you, too.

1110
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:38,376
Hey! Fucker!

1111
01:13:43,485 --> 01:13:44,509
Fucker!

1112
01:13:46,555 --> 01:13:47,886
Fucker!

1113
01:13:54,830 --> 01:13:55,854
Fucker!

1114
01:13:55,998 --> 01:13:58,228
Who do you
work for?

1115
01:13:58,300 --> 01:13:59,995
Who do you work for?

1116
01:14:04,807 --> 01:14:07,241
Who are you?
Who are you?

1117
01:14:07,376 --> 01:14:09,810
Who do you work for?
CIA? NSC?

1118
01:14:09,878 --> 01:14:11,812
Tuchman Marsh!
- What?

1119
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:13,245
Tuchman Marsh.
- Tuchman Marsh?

1120
01:14:13,348 --> 01:14:14,372
Yes.

1121
01:14:14,483 --> 01:14:15,507
Your name is Tuchman Marsh?

1122
01:14:15,584 --> 01:14:17,848
Tuchman Marsh
Hauptman Rodino!

1123
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:19,649
I work for them!
You work for Tuchman Marsh.

1124
01:14:19,721 --> 01:14:20,847
Yes!

1125
01:14:21,623 --> 01:14:22,715
Is that a law firm?

1126
01:14:22,825 --> 01:14:25,123
No, a rock band.
Yes, it's a law firm.

1127
01:14:25,194 --> 01:14:26,923
Well, why are you
following me?

1128
01:14:26,995 --> 01:14:28,724
Divorce action,
numb nuts!

1129
01:14:32,267 --> 01:14:33,256
My wife hired you?

1130
01:14:33,402 --> 01:14:36,303
No. Your wife hired Tuchman Marsh.
Tuchman Marsh hired me.

1131
01:14:36,405 --> 01:14:38,373
I work for Tuchman Marsh.

1132
01:14:49,985 --> 01:14:51,316
Sandy.

1133
01:14:51,887 --> 01:14:54,720
Jesus. Grow up, man.
It happens to everybody.

1134
01:15:00,128 --> 01:15:02,596
"And at midnight
of the third day,

1135
01:15:02,664 --> 01:15:06,156
"even the sergeant
at arms fell asleep.

1136
01:15:07,703 --> 01:15:14,165
"And it was just then, at that very moment,
that Oliver sneezed."

1137
01:15:14,543 --> 01:15:15,874
Can we just...
- I'm sorry to interrupt.

1138
01:15:15,944 --> 01:15:18,378
You have to let the folks at
home see this illustration.

1139
01:15:18,447 --> 01:15:19,846
Can we just get
a shot of that?

1140
01:15:19,982 --> 01:15:21,415
There, there it is.

1141
01:15:21,483 --> 01:15:23,747
It's Oliver interrupting
the filibuster with...

1142
01:15:24,987 --> 01:15:26,887
That's wonderful.
It's wonderful.

1143
01:15:26,955 --> 01:15:29,150
The book is <i>Point</i>
<i>of Order Oliver!</i>

1144
01:15:29,258 --> 01:15:32,591
And the talented author
is Sandra Pfarrer.

1145
01:15:32,661 --> 01:15:34,253
She'll stay with us
for our next segment

1146
01:15:34,329 --> 01:15:36,229
when we meet
the Sultan of Salad.

1147
01:15:36,298 --> 01:15:39,927
And then it's part two of our very
special interview with Dermot Mulroney.

1148
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:41,502
So keep it where it is.

1149
01:15:43,705 --> 01:15:46,606
That was way out of line.
We were so unbelievably clear with them,

1150
01:15:46,708 --> 01:15:48,107
"It's just an Oliver segment."
- That's fine.

1151
01:15:48,176 --> 01:15:49,165
Del and Connie
are such putzes.

1152
01:15:49,278 --> 01:15:50,267
That's fine.
Thank you, we're done.

1153
01:15:50,345 --> 01:15:51,778
Well, okay, great.

1154
01:15:52,047 --> 01:15:54,345
I thought that
would never end.

1155
01:15:55,784 --> 01:15:57,251
Me, too.

1156
01:16:00,289 --> 01:16:02,553
Let me get
this crap off my face.

1157
01:16:23,211 --> 01:16:25,270
What the fuck?

1158
01:16:33,488 --> 01:16:35,820
Yes, madam.
Can we help you?

1159
01:16:36,058 --> 01:16:38,618
What kind of Mickey Mouse
embassy are you running, anyway?

1160
01:16:38,694 --> 01:16:40,389
I've been waiting
for 45 minutes!

1161
01:16:40,495 --> 01:16:42,326
I'm so sorry, ma'am.
An urgent matter.

1162
01:16:42,397 --> 01:16:44,365
Well, maybe this
is an urgent matter,

1163
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:47,493
since, you know, Chad's
been missing for 48 hours.

1164
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:51,238
I do not know the whereabouts
of Mr. Chad, madam.

1165
01:16:51,273 --> 01:16:54,436
He was gathering information
for you when he was taken.

1166
01:16:55,544 --> 01:16:59,810
We're not interested in such
information. It was dribble.

1167
01:17:01,216 --> 01:17:03,207
Dribble?

1168
01:17:03,585 --> 01:17:05,382
Would you like your
disk back, madam?

1169
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:06,444
Dribble?

1170
01:17:07,389 --> 01:17:09,755
I will give you dribble.
You listen to me, Mr. Krapotkin.

1171
01:17:09,825 --> 01:17:11,019
I am a US citizen,

1172
01:17:11,093 --> 01:17:13,254
and I will not take
this kind of treatment.

1173
01:17:18,867 --> 01:17:23,327
My check was returned
for insufficient funds.

1174
01:17:23,705 --> 01:17:25,605
No. No, no, ma'am. No.

1175
01:17:25,674 --> 01:17:28,472
There're over $40,000
in that account.

1176
01:17:28,543 --> 01:17:30,477
The account
is not overdrawn.

1177
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:33,304
When?

1178
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:37,551
But how could she
have access with...

1179
01:17:38,387 --> 01:17:40,446
What about our savings...

1180
01:17:40,522 --> 01:17:43,150
What about my
savings account?

1181
01:17:43,225 --> 01:17:44,590
Mmm-hmm.

1182
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:50,064
No. No, I'm sorry. I don't know
the number to my savings account,

1183
01:17:50,132 --> 01:17:53,397
because believe it or not,
I don't spend my entire day

1184
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:56,733
sitting around trying to
memorize the fucking numbers

1185
01:17:56,838 --> 01:18:00,069
to my fucking bank
accounts! Moron!

1186
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:17,415
No way. No, no way. Whoa!
No way, Linda. No.

1187
01:18:17,492 --> 01:18:18,823
Well, I can't do it, Ted.

1188
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:20,291
I don't know anything
about computers.

1189
01:18:20,395 --> 01:18:21,692
Linda, this whole
thing is crazy.

1190
01:18:21,763 --> 01:18:24,095
It was crazy the first time,
and you want to do it again?

1191
01:18:24,166 --> 01:18:27,226
Break into the man's house?

1192
01:18:27,335 --> 01:18:29,530
You said the Russians
didn't even want this stuff.

1193
01:18:29,638 --> 01:18:31,105
My world is bigger
than that, Ted.

1194
01:18:31,206 --> 01:18:32,332
There are other people.

1195
01:18:32,507 --> 01:18:33,701
There are the Chinese.

1196
01:18:33,809 --> 01:18:34,833
Linda,
these surgeries...

1197
01:18:35,010 --> 01:18:36,102
No. It's not about
the surgeries, Ted!

1198
01:18:36,178 --> 01:18:38,646
We can use this as
leverage to get Chad back.

1199
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:39,769
What do you mean
get him back?

1200
01:18:39,848 --> 01:18:41,440
Information is power, Ted.
Hello!

1201
01:18:41,516 --> 01:18:42,642
What do you mean
get him back?

1202
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:43,776
You don't know where he is?

1203
01:18:45,454 --> 01:18:47,547
Somebody has him, Ted.
We can use this to...

1204
01:18:47,656 --> 01:18:49,817
You call the police if you
wanna get back missing people.

1205
01:18:49,891 --> 01:18:51,358
I can't take it! I can't take it!
I can't take it!

1206
01:18:51,426 --> 01:18:52,620
You know I can't do that.

1207
01:18:52,694 --> 01:18:54,457
We're operating off
the map here, Ted.

1208
01:18:54,529 --> 01:18:56,497
This is higher than the police.
It is higher than them.

1209
01:18:56,565 --> 01:18:58,624
Linda, I...
- I need a can-do person, Ted!

1210
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:00,930
I hate your negativity!
I hate your reasons why not!

1211
01:19:01,103 --> 01:19:03,571
I hate you! I hate you!

1212
01:19:14,282 --> 01:19:16,147
What will it be?

1213
01:19:17,085 --> 01:19:18,985
Seven and Seven.

1214
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:26,723
Hello?
<i>- It's Harry.</i>

1215
01:19:27,562 --> 01:19:30,895
You think a marriage is...
And then it's...

1216
01:19:35,003 --> 01:19:37,563
But this has all been
a long time coming.

1217
01:19:39,207 --> 01:19:42,870
Was it? Well, yeah, right.

1218
01:19:43,111 --> 01:19:44,942
I'm just depressed.

1219
01:19:47,883 --> 01:19:50,283
I gotta exercise.
I haven't run in three days.

1220
01:19:50,352 --> 01:19:52,217
Butt crunches,
anything.

1221
01:19:53,922 --> 01:19:55,321
You think maybe I could
stay here for a little while?

1222
01:19:55,423 --> 01:19:56,981
Oh, my God.
No, no, no, no, no.

1223
01:19:57,058 --> 01:19:59,185
It can't always
come from me.

1224
01:19:59,261 --> 01:20:00,956
I'm not that strong!

1225
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:03,530
You are not here
for me, Harry.

1226
01:20:03,965 --> 01:20:07,628
I need a can-do person!
You're all defeated!

1227
01:20:07,669 --> 01:20:09,432
Chad is the only
can-do person I know,

1228
01:20:09,538 --> 01:20:11,563
and now he's gone. He's gone.
I'm sorry, baby.

1229
01:20:11,673 --> 01:20:13,504
I'll be good.
I'll be better.

1230
01:20:14,109 --> 01:20:15,542
I just gotta exercise.

1231
01:20:15,610 --> 01:20:18,306
Do you have a pedestrian path or something?
- Who the fuck is Chad?

1232
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:19,847
He's my friend from work.

1233
01:20:19,981 --> 01:20:21,448
You can help me find him.

1234
01:20:21,516 --> 01:20:22,574
You know law
enforcement people.

1235
01:20:22,717 --> 01:20:23,775
You could make a call.

1236
01:20:23,852 --> 01:20:25,114
Unofficially.
- Linda, hold on.

1237
01:20:25,187 --> 01:20:26,279
What happened?
What's his name?

1238
01:20:26,354 --> 01:20:27,378
Chad Feldheimer.

1239
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:30,617
And he just disappeared. He hasn't
been at work or at home for two days!

1240
01:20:30,692 --> 01:20:32,319
Okay. You know his
Social Security number?

1241
01:20:32,394 --> 01:20:34,624
No! I...
- Okay.

1242
01:20:34,696 --> 01:20:35,788
Where was the last
place you saw him?

1243
01:20:35,864 --> 01:20:37,593
No, I don't know.
He just disappeared.

1244
01:20:37,732 --> 01:20:39,461
The Jamba Juice on K Street.

1245
01:20:39,568 --> 01:20:41,297
And now he's gone.

1246
01:20:41,469 --> 01:20:43,232
No. Okay.
Now, okay, okay.

1247
01:20:43,371 --> 01:20:46,602
We're gonna find your little
buddy. It's a piece of cake.

1248
01:20:46,708 --> 01:20:47,732
Okay.

1249
01:20:47,876 --> 01:20:51,403
Piece of cake. Very easy. Okay.

1250
01:20:52,914 --> 01:20:56,748
Open your mouth, open it. Do as the
doctor says. Come on, open your mouth.

1251
01:20:56,852 --> 01:20:59,787
Come on. Open your mouth.
Now look here, young man.

1252
01:20:59,888 --> 01:21:03,187
You do as I say, or I'm gonna ask
your mother to leave the doctor's room,

1253
01:21:03,358 --> 01:21:05,792
and you and I are gonna
sort it out between us.

1254
01:21:10,565 --> 01:21:15,002
Hello?
I'm with a patient.

1255
01:21:15,070 --> 01:21:19,029
And it's the same fucking patient
she's been with since yesterday?

1256
01:21:19,174 --> 01:21:22,007
You tell Dr. Cox
I have the new keys.

1257
01:21:39,628 --> 01:21:41,255
Hey, there, sunshine.

1258
01:21:42,631 --> 01:21:43,757
You seem better.

1259
01:21:43,865 --> 01:21:46,060
Yeah, well, I snuck in a
little gym time this morning.

1260
01:21:46,167 --> 01:21:47,691
And our exercise
last night didn't hurt.

1261
01:21:47,869 --> 01:21:49,427
Why, Harry.

1262
01:21:49,571 --> 01:21:52,597
Boy, I tell you. I'm through
banging my head against the wall.

1263
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:54,231
I'm gonna start doing
what's right for me.

1264
01:21:54,342 --> 01:21:56,469
I believe that, also. I think you
have to do what's right for you.

1265
01:21:56,578 --> 01:21:58,409
Yeah. Hell, yeah. You know,
I had a shock recently,

1266
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:01,711
and I realized that life is not
infinite and that no one is immortal.

1267
01:22:01,850 --> 01:22:04,080
I think that it's very important
to maintain a positive attitude.

1268
01:22:04,152 --> 01:22:05,517
Always up,
always ebullient.

1269
01:22:05,553 --> 01:22:07,145
Don't sweat
the small stuff.

1270
01:22:07,188 --> 01:22:09,122
And it's all small stuff.
And it's all small stuff.

1271
01:22:27,976 --> 01:22:31,002
Just for starters.

1272
01:22:32,847 --> 01:22:34,314
Boy.

1273
01:22:35,583 --> 01:22:38,609
Why, this is where we
first met, you remember?

1274
01:22:38,687 --> 01:22:40,484
Of course I do.

1275
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:44,653
And it's hard to know what the
important days are until you...

1276
01:22:46,761 --> 01:22:48,854
Now, I told myself that I
wasn't going to be paranoid,

1277
01:22:48,930 --> 01:22:50,955
but is that guy
looking at us?

1278
01:22:53,902 --> 01:22:55,028
No. Uh-uh.

1279
01:22:55,971 --> 01:22:57,529
Have you found out
anything about Chad?

1280
01:22:57,639 --> 01:22:58,628
No, nothing yet.

1281
01:22:58,740 --> 01:23:00,708
I put in a couple of calls.
It shouldn't take too long.

1282
01:23:00,875 --> 01:23:01,864
Really?

1283
01:23:02,577 --> 01:23:05,478
Yeah. There are so many
databases now it's a joke.

1284
01:23:05,513 --> 01:23:08,004
Back when I was in PP,
there was still an art

1285
01:23:08,049 --> 01:23:09,607
to finding people.
But not anymore.

1286
01:23:09,684 --> 01:23:13,450
Now with cell phones? I mean,
pretty soon everybody's gonna know

1287
01:23:13,521 --> 01:23:15,489
where you are at any given
moment, any given moment.

1288
01:23:15,590 --> 01:23:16,852
Mmm-hmm.

1289
01:23:17,659 --> 01:23:18,683
All right.

1290
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:20,991
When you left Jamba Juice,

1291
01:23:21,062 --> 01:23:23,826
did Chad give you any idea
where he might be going?

1292
01:23:23,898 --> 01:23:26,162
I know where he was going.
- You do?

1293
01:23:26,267 --> 01:23:31,671
Georgetown. Olive Street.
160 Olive Street.

1294
01:23:32,507 --> 01:23:35,476
It's the residence of this guy,
Osborne Cox.

1295
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:45,418
Who are you?

1296
01:23:48,556 --> 01:23:49,580
What?

1297
01:23:50,592 --> 01:23:54,756
Who are you?
You CIA? NSA? You're military?

1298
01:23:55,697 --> 01:23:59,758
Who do you work for?
Who do you work for?

1299
01:24:01,336 --> 01:24:02,803
Who are you?

1300
01:24:04,172 --> 01:24:08,131
I'm just Linda Litzke.

1301
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:25,454
Harry!

1302
01:26:12,433 --> 01:26:14,196
For Pete's sake.

1303
01:26:47,101 --> 01:26:52,740
And you are my wife's lover?

1304
01:26:52,775 --> 01:26:53,729
No.

1305
01:26:53,841 --> 01:26:54,865
Then what are
you doing here?

1306
01:26:57,579 --> 01:27:01,242
I know you.
You're the guy from the gym.

1307
01:27:02,684 --> 01:27:04,481
I'm not here
representing Hardbodies.

1308
01:27:04,586 --> 01:27:08,078
Yes. I know very well
what you represent.

1309
01:27:08,523 --> 01:27:11,219
You represent
the idiocy of today.

1310
01:27:13,528 --> 01:27:15,018
I don't represent
that, either.

1311
01:27:15,096 --> 01:27:16,757
Yeah.
You're the guy at the gym

1312
01:27:16,831 --> 01:27:18,890
when I asked about
that moronic woman.

1313
01:27:18,967 --> 01:27:21,265
She's not a moron.

1314
01:27:21,436 --> 01:27:23,768
You're in league
with that moronic woman.

1315
01:27:23,905 --> 01:27:26,237
You're part of
a league of morons.

1316
01:27:26,307 --> 01:27:27,797
No. No.

1317
01:27:27,909 --> 01:27:30,639
Yes. You see,
you're one of the morons

1318
01:27:30,712 --> 01:27:33,340
I've been fighting
my whole life,

1319
01:27:33,514 --> 01:27:37,507
my whole fucking life.
But guess what.

1320
01:27:39,587 --> 01:27:41,452
Today, I win.

1321
01:27:51,532 --> 01:27:52,624
Stop!

1322
01:27:54,235 --> 01:27:55,634
Intruder!

1323
01:27:56,337 --> 01:27:59,864
Stop! Intruder! Stop!

1324
01:28:04,078 --> 01:28:06,012
Wait. Wait a minute.

1325
01:28:09,117 --> 01:28:11,745
Where is the Treasury guy?
- Pfarrer?

1326
01:28:11,819 --> 01:28:13,684
Right now?
- Right now.

1327
01:28:14,422 --> 01:28:16,822
He is in a detention room
at Washington Dulles.

1328
01:28:16,924 --> 01:28:17,948
Why?

1329
01:28:18,092 --> 01:28:20,652
He was trying to board
a flight to Venezuela.

1330
01:28:20,828 --> 01:28:24,286
We had his name on a hot list.
CBP pulled him in.

1331
01:28:26,034 --> 01:28:29,170
Don't know why he was
trying to go to Venezuela.

1332
01:28:29,205 --> 01:28:30,296
You don't know.

1333
01:28:30,405 --> 01:28:31,531
No, sir.

1334
01:28:32,540 --> 01:28:34,667
We have no extradition
with Venezuela.

1335
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:36,402
Oh!

1336
01:28:37,478 --> 01:28:39,070
So what should
we do with him?

1337
01:28:39,180 --> 01:28:41,205
For fuck's sake, put him on
the next flight to Venezuela.

1338
01:28:41,316 --> 01:28:43,147
Yes, sir. Okay.

1339
01:28:43,985 --> 01:28:47,216
Okay. So the gym manager is dead.
- Yes, sir.

1340
01:28:47,322 --> 01:28:48,346
The body is...

1341
01:28:48,423 --> 01:28:49,788
That's gone, sir.

1342
01:28:51,492 --> 01:28:52,516
Okay.

1343
01:28:53,194 --> 01:28:56,857
But there was a snag.

1344
01:28:57,732 --> 01:28:59,029
What?

1345
01:28:59,467 --> 01:29:00,729
Well,

1346
01:29:01,369 --> 01:29:06,329
this analyst, Cox,
was attacking the gym guy.

1347
01:29:06,708 --> 01:29:08,699
It was in broad daylight,
on the street.

1348
01:29:08,810 --> 01:29:11,176
Our man did not
know what to do.

1349
01:29:11,245 --> 01:29:12,473
Felt he had to step in.

1350
01:29:13,114 --> 01:29:14,342
Yes?

1351
01:29:14,982 --> 01:29:16,313
He...

1352
01:29:18,219 --> 01:29:21,586
He shot the analyst.
He shot Cox.

1353
01:29:23,658 --> 01:29:26,559
Good. Great.
Is he dead?

1354
01:29:26,627 --> 01:29:28,720
No, sir. He's in a coma.

1355
01:29:29,764 --> 01:29:32,324
They don't think he's gonna
make it. They don't think...

1356
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:36,029
They're pretty sure that
he has no brain function.

1357
01:29:37,271 --> 01:29:42,208
Okay. Okay. If he wakes up, we'll worry
about it then. Jesus, what a clusterfuck.

1358
01:29:42,310 --> 01:29:44,608
So, that's it then?

1359
01:29:44,712 --> 01:29:47,647
No one else really
knows anything. Okay.

1360
01:29:47,749 --> 01:29:48,943
Um...

1361
01:29:49,050 --> 01:29:51,644
Well, sir, there is...

1362
01:29:51,719 --> 01:29:53,277
What?

1363
01:29:54,122 --> 01:29:55,555
What?

1364
01:29:55,623 --> 01:29:58,251
There is the woman,
the gym woman,

1365
01:29:58,326 --> 01:29:59,588
Linda Litzke.

1366
01:29:59,660 --> 01:30:02,652
Oh! Fuck, yeah.
God! Where is she?

1367
01:30:02,797 --> 01:30:04,765
We picked her up.
We have her.

1368
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:07,095
We have her?
To do what with?

1369
01:30:07,201 --> 01:30:13,663
She says she'll play ball
if we pay for some,

1370
01:30:13,808 --> 01:30:17,244
I know this sounds odd,
some surgeries

1371
01:30:17,345 --> 01:30:20,439
that she wants,
cosmetic surgery.

1372
01:30:20,982 --> 01:30:23,382
She says she'll sit
on everything.

1373
01:30:23,951 --> 01:30:25,145
How much?

1374
01:30:25,219 --> 01:30:26,618
There were
several procedures.

1375
01:30:26,687 --> 01:30:27,813
Altogether they...
- Pay it.

1376
01:30:27,889 --> 01:30:30,084
Yes, sir. Okay. Yeah.

1377
01:30:33,394 --> 01:30:34,759
Jesus fucking Christ!

1378
01:30:34,829 --> 01:30:36,319
Yeah.

1379
01:30:37,865 --> 01:30:39,696
What do we learn, Palmer?

1380
01:30:39,767 --> 01:30:41,132
I don't know, sir.

1381
01:30:42,069 --> 01:30:43,764
I don't fucking know, either.

1382
01:30:45,206 --> 01:30:47,401
I guess we learn not to do it again.
- Yes, sir.

1383
01:30:47,475 --> 01:30:49,602
I'm fucked if
I know what we did.

1384
01:30:49,744 --> 01:30:51,905
Yes, sir,
it's hard to say.

1385
01:30:53,481 --> 01:30:55,881
Jesus fucking Christ.

1386
01:34:06,617 --> 01:34:07,620
