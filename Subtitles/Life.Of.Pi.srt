LIFE OF PI

00:03:57,257 --> 00:04:00,109
– So, you were raised in a zoo?
– Born and raised…

3
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:03,642
In Pondicherry, in what was
the French part of India.

4
00:04:04,165 --> 00:04:05,712
My father owned the zoo.

5
00:04:06,048 --> 00:04:09,215
And I was delivered on short notice
by a herpetologist,

6
00:04:09,559 --> 00:04:12,274
who was there to check on
the Bengal monitor lizard.

7
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:15,319
Mother and I were both healthy,

8
00:04:15,945 --> 00:04:17,668
but the poor lizard escaped,

9
00:04:17,684 --> 00:04:20,722
and was trampled by
a frightened cassowary.

10
00:04:23,006 --> 00:04:25,273
The way of karma, huh?

11
00:04:25,794 --> 00:04:27,084
The way of God.

12
00:04:28,215 --> 00:04:29,212
That's quite a story.

13
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:33,321
I'd assumed your father was
a mathematician, because of your name.

14
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,420
No, far from it: I was named
after a swimming pool.

15
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,182
There was a swimming pool named “Pi”?

16
00:04:41,048 --> 00:04:45,182
You see, my uncle Francis was born
with too much water in his lungs.

17
00:04:45,922 --> 00:04:50,191
They say the doctor swung Francis around
by the ankles, to clear the water out.

18
00:04:50,443 --> 00:04:53,235
And that's what gave him
his huge chest and skinny legs,

19
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:54,943
that made him such a great swimmer.

20
00:04:56,514 --> 00:04:59,813
Is Francis actually your uncle,
he said he was friends with your father?

21
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,806
Well, he's my “honorary” uncle.
I call him “Mamaji”.

22
00:05:03,364 --> 00:05:05,996
My father's best friend, my swimming guru.

23
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,834
I trained with him three times
a week at the Ashram.

24
00:05:10,037 --> 00:05:12,616
His lessons would save my life in the end.

25
00:05:13,843 --> 00:05:16,309
A mouthful of water will not harm you.

26
00:05:16,577 --> 00:05:18,245
But panic will.

27
00:05:19,321 --> 00:05:22,519
And remember to breathe now,
don't hold your breath.

28
00:05:23,385 --> 00:05:24,352
Good boy.

29
00:05:28,089 --> 00:05:29,864
I hope you don't mind vegetarian.

30
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:31,638
No, no. Not at all.

31
00:05:32,371 --> 00:05:34,349
– And your name?
– Uh?

32
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,249
You were going to tell me
how you got your name, I think.

33
00:05:37,385 --> 00:05:40,915
Oh yes! I got it from something
Mamaji once told my father.

34
00:05:41,555 --> 00:05:45,326
You see, most travelers collect postcards
or tea cups on their journeys,

35
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,254
but not Mamaji.

36
00:05:46,349 --> 00:05:48,133
Mamaji collects swimming pools.

37
00:05:48,565 --> 00:05:50,915
He swims in every pool he comes upon.

38
00:05:59,186 --> 00:06:03,213
One day, Mamaji said to my father,
that of all the pools in the world,

39
00:06:03,221 --> 00:06:06,065
the most beautiful was
a public pool in Paris.

40
00:06:07,248 --> 00:06:08,828
That the water there was so clear,

41
00:06:08,829 --> 00:06:11,086
you could make your
morning coffee with it.

42
00:06:11,299 --> 00:06:14,122
That a single swim there changed his life.

43
00:06:28,525 --> 00:06:30,288
Before I was born, he said:

44
00:06:30,477 --> 00:06:32,969
“If you want your son
to have a clean soul,

45
00:06:33,299 --> 00:06:37,328
you must take him one day
to swim in the piscine Molitor”.

46
00:06:37,902 --> 00:06:41,586
I never understood why my father
took this so much to heart.

47
00:06:42,062 --> 00:06:43,220
But he did.

48
00:06:43,908 --> 00:06:46,534
And I was named “Piscine Molitor Patel”.

49
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:50,447
Imagine me trying to explain that name.

50
00:06:50,798 --> 00:06:53,105
I barely made it to the age of eleven.

51
00:06:53,119 --> 00:06:53,467
Before…
¨

52
00:06:53,468 --> 00:06:54,834
Before…
– Hey, “Pissing”!

53
00:06:56,672 --> 00:06:58,381
Are you pissing right now?

54
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:01,829
Look at him, he is pissing.

55
00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:06,071
With one word, my name went
from an elegant French swimming pool

56
00:07:06,082 --> 00:07:07,927
to a stinking Indian latrine.

57
00:07:08,002 --> 00:07:09,951
I was “pissing” everywhere.

58
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,948
No pissing in the schoolyard!

59
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,093
Even the teacher started doing it.
Not deliberately, of course.

60
00:07:17,474 --> 00:07:18,115
So then…

61
00:07:18,384 --> 00:07:21,063
What might occur if you
release gas too quickly?

62
00:07:21,451 --> 00:07:22,544
Pissing?

63
00:07:23,205 --> 00:07:25,308
He said pissing, guys.

64
00:07:27,644 --> 00:07:29,044
Pissing!

65
00:07:30,706 --> 00:07:31,615
That's enough! Order! Order!

66
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:38,186
When we returned the next for our
first day of school, I was prepared.

67
00:07:38,326 --> 00:07:39,355
Present, sir!

68
00:07:39,762 --> 00:07:41,152
Piscine Patel.

69
00:07:47,417 --> 00:07:48,091
Good Morning.

70
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:50,276
I am Piscine Molitor Patel.

71
00:07:51,397 --> 00:07:52,742
Know to all as:

72
00:07:54,128 --> 00:07:55,022
“PI”

73
00:07:55,476 --> 00:07:57,435
The sixteenth letter
of the Greek alphabet.

74
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:01,012
Which is also used in mathematics
to represent the ratio

75
00:08:01,246 --> 00:08:04,791
of any circle's circumference
to its diameter.

76
00:08:05,071 --> 00:08:09,682
An irrational number of infinite length,
usually rounded to three digits,

77
00:08:09,683 --> 00:08:13,954
as 3 .14,

78
00:08:14,496 --> 00:08:15,380
PI.

79
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,446
Very impressive… PI.

80
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,891
Now sit down.

81
00:08:25,484 --> 00:08:26,783
– R Velusami?
– Present, sir.

82
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:28,575
And from then on, you were Pi?

83
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,681
Well no, not quite.

84
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,964
Nice try, Pissing.

85
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,811
But I still had the whole day ahead of me.

86
00:08:37,227 --> 00:08:38,398
French class was next.

87
00:08:38,853 --> 00:08:40,897
Je m'appelle Piscine Molitor Patel.

88
00:08:41,077 --> 00:08:42,380
Dit: Pi.

89
00:08:45,072 --> 00:08:46,304
Then geography.

90
00:08:46,553 --> 00:08:49,456
These are the first twenty
decimal places of Pi.

91
00:08:50,249 --> 00:08:53,125
My last class of the day was mathematics.

92
00:09:00,822 --> 00:09:01,469
4…

93
00:09:02,015 --> 00:09:02,721
3…

94
00:09:03,468 --> 00:09:04,375
7…

95
00:09:05,055 --> 00:09:05,890
5…

96
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:07,428
8…

97
00:09:07,956 --> 00:09:12,719
5… 8… 5… 8…

98
00:09:13,858 --> 00:09:16,927
It's right!
He's really doing this!

99
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,448
By the end of that day, I was
“PI Patel”, school legend.

100
00:09:27,756 --> 00:09:30,346
Mamaji tells me you're
a legend among sailors, too…

101
00:09:30,521 --> 00:09:31,700
Out there, all alone.

102
00:09:31,701 --> 00:09:33,947
Oh, I don't even know how to sail.

103
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:37,298
And I wasn't alone out there,
Richard Parker was with me.

104
00:09:37,831 --> 00:09:39,571
Richard Parker?

105
00:09:40,053 --> 00:09:41,999
Mamaji, he didn't tell me everything,

106
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:44,481
he just said I should look you up
when I got back to Montreal.

107
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:46,512
So what were you doing in Pondicherry?

108
00:09:48,527 --> 00:09:50,255
Writing a novel.

109
00:09:50,711 --> 00:09:52,728
By the way, I enjoyed your first book.

110
00:09:53,683 --> 00:09:55,236
So this new one is set in India?

111
00:09:55,378 --> 00:09:58,832
No, Portugal actually.
But it's cheaper living in India.

112
00:10:02,273 --> 00:10:03,755
Well, I look forward to reading it.

113
00:10:04,009 --> 00:10:05,409
You can't.

114
00:10:05,753 --> 00:10:06,806
I threw it out.

115
00:10:07,393 --> 00:10:10,468
Two years trying to bring
this thing to life, and then one day…

116
00:10:10,989 --> 00:10:12,493
sputtered, coughed and died.

117
00:10:14,058 --> 00:10:15,635
Oh, I'm sorry.

118
00:10:17,301 --> 00:10:20,513
So I was sitting in this
coffee house in Pondicherry

119
00:10:20,514 --> 00:10:22,997
one afternoon mourning
my loss, when this

120
00:10:23,466 --> 00:10:26,419
old man at the table next to me,
struck up a conversation.

121
00:10:26,469 --> 00:10:27,897
Yeah, Mamaji he does that.

122
00:10:28,067 --> 00:10:30,277
When I told him my abandoned
book, he said:

123
00:10:30,293 --> 00:10:33,105
<i>So, a Canadian
who's come to French India,</i>

124
00:10:33,129 --> 00:10:35,275
<i>in search for a story. Well, my friend,</i>

125
00:10:35,373 --> 00:10:40,411
<i>I know an Indian in French Canada,
with the most incredible story to tell.</i>

126
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:44,520
<i>It must be fate that the
two of you should meet.</i>

127
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:50,945
Well, I haven't spoken about Richard Parker
in so many years.

128
00:10:51,589 --> 00:10:53,704
So what has Mamaji already told you?

129
00:10:54,235 --> 00:10:56,892
He said you had a story that
would make me believe in God.

130
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,638
He would say that about a nice meal.

131
00:11:02,853 --> 00:11:04,876
As for God, I can only tell you my story.

132
00:11:06,947 --> 00:11:09,190
You'll decide for yourself
what you believe.

133
00:11:09,326 --> 00:11:10,726
Fair enough.

134
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:13,343
Let's see then. Where to begin?

135
00:11:15,492 --> 00:11:16,867
Pondicherry…

136
00:11:17,503 --> 00:11:19,751
is the French Riviera of India.

137
00:11:23,841 --> 00:11:25,702
In this place, closest to the ocean,

138
00:11:25,703 --> 00:11:28,236
you might think you are
in the south of France.

139
00:11:31,408 --> 00:11:34,048
A few blocks inland, there's a canal.

140
00:11:34,516 --> 00:11:36,895
Just beyond that is Indian Pondicherry.

141
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:40,500
And the Muslim quarter
is just to the west.

142
00:11:41,407 --> 00:11:45,095
When the French handed
Pondicherry back to us in 1954,

143
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:48,184
the town decided that some
sort of commemoration was in order.

144
00:11:48,932 --> 00:11:51,177
My father was a clever businessman.

145
00:11:51,306 --> 00:11:52,539
He came up with one.

146
00:11:52,789 --> 00:11:56,206
He ran a hotel,
and he got the idea to open a zoo

147
00:11:56,242 --> 00:11:59,129
in the local botanical gardens instead.

148
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:04,967
As it also happened, my mother
was a botanist in the gardens.

149
00:12:05,614 --> 00:12:09,300
They met, married, and a year later
my brother Ravi was born.

150
00:12:10,283 --> 00:12:12,569
I came two years after that.

151
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:17,597
Sounds magical.
Growing up…

152
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:23,749
Amen.

153
00:12:24,693 --> 00:12:26,069
Yeah, let's eat.

154
00:12:26,966 --> 00:12:28,551
I did not know Hindus said Amen.

155
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:30,230
Catholic Hindus do.

156
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:31,130
Catholic Hindus?

157
00:12:31,426 --> 00:12:35,427
We get to feel guilty before
hundreds of gods, instead of just one.

158
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:38,454
But you're a Hindu first.

159
00:12:38,996 --> 00:12:41,612
None of us knows God
until someone introduces us.

160
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:44,954
I was first introduced to God as a Hindu.

161
00:12:45,051 --> 00:12:47,572
There are 33 million gods
in the Hindu religion.

162
00:12:47,805 --> 00:12:50,224
How can I not come to know a few of them?

163
00:12:51,717 --> 00:12:53,282
I met Krishna first.

164
00:13:59,149 --> 00:14:01,694
The gods were my superheroes, growing up.

165
00:14:02,316 --> 00:14:04,465
Hanuman, the monkey god.

166
00:14:04,815 --> 00:14:08,511
Lifting an entire mountain
to save his friend, Lakshmana.

167
00:14:08,546 --> 00:14:10,656
Ganesh, the elephant headed,

168
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:14,869
risking his life to defend
the honor of his mother, Parvati.

169
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:18,477
Vishnu, the supreme soul,

170
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,566
the source of all things.

171
00:14:21,324 --> 00:14:25,286
Vishnu sleeps, floating on the
shoreless cosmic ocean,

172
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:27,669
and we are the stuff of his dreaming.

173
00:14:29,696 --> 00:14:30,836
Spectacle.

174
00:14:31,569 --> 00:14:36,397
Don't let the stories and
pretty lies fool you, boys.

175
00:14:37,173 --> 00:14:40,234
Religion is darkness.

176
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,972
My dear Appa believed himself
part of the new India.

177
00:14:46,602 --> 00:14:48,587
As a child, he'd had polio.

178
00:14:49,045 --> 00:14:53,092
He used to lie in bed wracked with pain,
wondering where God was.

179
00:14:54,024 --> 00:14:57,737
In the end, God didn't save him,
Western medicine did.

180
00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:04,388
My Amma went to college and thought

181
00:15:04,396 --> 00:15:06,867
our family was part
of the new India as well,

182
00:15:07,065 --> 00:15:11,296
But then her parents cut her off, because
they thought she was marrying beneath her.

183
00:15:12,491 --> 00:15:15,683
Our religion was the only link
she had to her past.

184
00:15:25,949 --> 00:15:28,992
I met Christ in the mountains
when I was 12.

185
00:15:29,856 --> 00:15:32,873
We were visiting relatives,
tea growers in Munnar.

186
00:15:33,527 --> 00:15:37,659
It was our third there,
Ravi and I were terribly bored.

187
00:15:37,733 --> 00:15:40,349
Challenge. I'll give you two rupees.

188
00:15:40,746 --> 00:15:43,266
Run into that church,
and drink the holy water.

189
00:16:22,745 --> 00:16:23,886
You must be thirsty.

190
00:16:27,841 --> 00:16:28,647
Here.

191
00:16:29,751 --> 00:16:31,039
I brought you this.

192
00:16:46,558 --> 00:16:48,690
Why would a God do that?

193
00:16:50,115 --> 00:16:55,137
Why would he send his own son
to suffer for the sins of ordinary people?

194
00:16:55,638 --> 00:16:56,779
Because he loves us.

195
00:16:58,156 --> 00:17:03,038
God made himself approachable to us,
human, so we could understand him.

196
00:17:03,675 --> 00:17:05,704
We can't understand God
nor his perfection.

197
00:17:06,402 --> 00:17:08,315
But we can understand God's son,

198
00:17:08,557 --> 00:17:11,735
and his suffering,
as we would of brothers.

199
00:17:11,852 --> 00:17:13,249
That made no sense!

200
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:18,013
Sacrificing the innocent,
to atone for the sins of the guilty,

201
00:17:18,721 --> 00:17:20,548
what kind of love is that?

202
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:27,518
But this son,
I couldn't get him out of my head.

203
00:17:30,188 --> 00:17:33,093
If God is so perfect, and we are not,

204
00:17:33,294 --> 00:17:35,932
why would he want to create all this?

205
00:17:36,631 --> 00:17:38,410
Why does he need us at all?

206
00:17:39,528 --> 00:17:42,063
All you have to know is that he loves us.

207
00:17:43,033 --> 00:17:46,026
God so loved his world
that he gave his only son.

208
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:50,793
The longer I listened to the priest,
the more I came to like the son of God.

209
00:17:51,353 --> 00:17:54,763
Thank you Vishnu,
for introducing me to Christ.

210
00:18:02,632 --> 00:18:06,940
I came to faith through Hinduism,
and I found God's love through Christ.

211
00:18:07,454 --> 00:18:09,394
But God wasn't finished with me yet.

212
00:18:20,054 --> 00:18:21,761
God works in mysterious ways.

213
00:18:22,715 --> 00:18:25,321
And so it was he introduced himself
to me again,

214
00:18:25,547 --> 00:18:27,183
this time by the name of Allah.

215
00:18:48,512 --> 00:18:50,677
My Arabic was never very good.

216
00:18:50,951 --> 00:18:54,135
But the sound and feel of the words
brought me closer to God.

217
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:58,424
In performing “Salah”, the ground
I touched became holy ground,

218
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:01,674
and I found a feeling of serenity
and brotherhood.

219
00:19:11,649 --> 00:19:14,134
This lamb is exquisite.

220
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:17,218
It's the best dish on the table.

221
00:19:17,496 --> 00:19:18,906
You're all missing out.

222
00:19:20,204 --> 00:19:23,388
You only need to convert
to three more religions, Piscine,

223
00:19:23,524 --> 00:19:25,725
and you'll spend your life on holiday.

224
00:19:26,794 --> 00:19:30,097
Are you going to Mecca
this year, Swami Jesus?

225
00:19:30,371 --> 00:19:33,757
Or to Rome for your
coronation as Pope Pius?

226
00:19:33,813 --> 00:19:35,164
You stay out of this, Ravi.

227
00:19:35,357 --> 00:19:37,679
Just like you like cricket,
Pi has his own interests.

228
00:19:37,942 --> 00:19:40,389
No, Gita. Ravi has a point, you know?

229
00:19:40,611 --> 00:19:44,245
You cannot follow three different
religions at the same time, Piscine.

230
00:19:45,077 --> 00:19:46,220
Why not?

231
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:50,236
Because, believing in
everything at the same time,

232
00:19:50,237 --> 00:19:53,139
is the same as not believing
in anything at all.

233
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:56,949
He's young, Santosh.
He's still finding his way.

234
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:00,492
And how can he find his way,
if he does not choose a path?

235
00:20:01,363 --> 00:20:05,822
Listen, instead of leaping
from one religion to the next,

236
00:20:05,865 --> 00:20:07,753
why not start with reason?

237
00:20:08,318 --> 00:20:12,432
In a few hundred years, science has taken
us farther in understanding the universe,

238
00:20:12,493 --> 00:20:15,047
than religion has in ten thousand.

239
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,937
That is true.

240
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,044
Your father is right.

241
00:20:21,673 --> 00:20:24,409
Science can teach us more
about what is out there,

242
00:20:24,752 --> 00:20:26,826
but not what is in here.

243
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:29,957
Yeah. Some eat meat, some eat vegetable,

244
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,468
I do not expect us to all
to agree about everything, but

245
00:20:33,825 --> 00:20:37,084
I'd much rather have you
believe in something I don't agree with,

246
00:20:37,101 --> 00:20:39,386
than to accept everything blindly.

247
00:20:39,887 --> 00:20:43,361
And that begins with thinking rationally.

248
00:20:44,862 --> 00:20:45,891
You understand?

249
00:20:49,017 --> 00:20:49,814
Good.

250
00:20:56,011 --> 00:20:57,987
I would like to be baptized.

251
00:21:04,959 --> 00:21:07,171
So, you're a Christian, and a Muslim.

252
00:21:07,219 --> 00:21:08,575
And an Hindu, of course.

253
00:21:08,703 --> 00:21:09,823
And a Jew, I suppose.

254
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:13,807
Well I do teach the course
on the Kabbala at the University.

255
00:21:14,059 --> 00:21:16,777
And why not?
Faith is a house with many rooms.

256
00:21:17,062 --> 00:21:18,313
But no room for doubt?

257
00:21:18,354 --> 00:21:20,401
Oh, plenty. On every floor.

258
00:21:20,521 --> 00:21:21,645
Doubt is useful.

259
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:23,783
It keeps Faith a living thing.

260
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:28,035
After all, you cannot know the strength
of your faith until it has been tested.

261
00:21:31,495 --> 00:21:34,140
Where's Selvam?
We shouldn't be in here without him.

262
00:21:34,513 --> 00:21:35,662
Stop worrying.

263
00:21:37,466 --> 00:21:40,274
I have seen him do this a thousand times.

264
00:21:43,108 --> 00:21:44,923
I want to meet our new tiger.

265
00:21:46,486 --> 00:21:47,715
Pi!

266
00:21:47,986 --> 00:21:50,293
Hello? Richard Parker?

267
00:21:50,944 --> 00:21:52,140
Tiger?

268
00:21:52,784 --> 00:21:54,133
Richard Parker was a tiger?

269
00:21:54,134 --> 00:21:56,520
Yeah, he got this name
through a clerical error.

270
00:21:57,136 --> 00:22:00,245
A hunter caught him drinking
from a stream when he was a cub,

271
00:22:00,324 --> 00:22:01,594
and named him “Thirsty”.

272
00:22:02,182 --> 00:22:05,501
When Thirsty got too big,
the hunter sold him to our zoo,

273
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,641
but the names got switched
on the paperwork.

274
00:22:08,893 --> 00:22:12,632
The hunter was listed as Thirsty,
and the tiger was called Richard Parker.

275
00:22:13,293 --> 00:22:14,978
We laughed about it.

276
00:22:15,201 --> 00:22:16,329
And the name stuck!

277
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:18,114
Let's go…

278
00:22:19,293 --> 00:22:21,340
Before we get into trouble!

279
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,385
I want to see him closer.

280
00:22:23,631 --> 00:22:25,182
You're not the zookeeper!

281
00:22:25,424 --> 00:22:26,249
Come on!

282
00:22:45,071 --> 00:22:47,150
Touch it Richard Parker.

283
00:22:47,358 --> 00:22:48,834
It's for you.

284
00:23:18,786 --> 00:23:19,631
No!

285
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,379
What are you thinking?

286
00:23:23,484 --> 00:23:24,712
Are you out of your mind?

287
00:23:24,932 --> 00:23:26,815
Who gave you the permission
to come back here?

288
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:29,768
You have just ignored everything
I've ever taught you?

289
00:23:31,049 --> 00:23:33,618
I-I just wanted to say Hello to him.

290
00:23:35,494 --> 00:23:37,212
You think that tiger is your friend.

291
00:23:37,385 --> 00:23:39,862
He's an animal, not a playmate!

292
00:23:40,962 --> 00:23:42,709
Animals have souls.

293
00:23:43,276 --> 00:23:46,126
I have seen it in their eyes.

294
00:23:48,297 --> 00:23:49,369
Find Selvan.

295
00:24:06,012 --> 00:24:08,161
Animals do not think like we do.

296
00:24:08,862 --> 00:24:12,806
People who forget that,
get themselves killed. That tiger…

297
00:24:13,687 --> 00:24:15,949
is not your friend.

298
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,690
When you look into his eyes,

299
00:24:17,698 --> 00:24:20,859
you are seeing your own emotions
reflected back at you.

300
00:24:21,312 --> 00:24:22,712
Nothing else.

301
00:24:23,485 --> 00:24:25,517
You stupid.
Say “I'm sorry.”

302
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,567
What have you done, Piscine?

303
00:24:29,168 --> 00:24:31,595
You know what your father said
about coming back here?

304
00:24:31,967 --> 00:24:33,105
I am sorry.

305
00:24:33,844 --> 00:24:35,244
I was…

306
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,061
What are you thinking?

307
00:24:37,157 --> 00:24:39,150
This is between a father and his sons.

308
00:24:39,295 --> 00:24:40,531
Selvan, cut away!

309
00:24:40,918 --> 00:24:43,955
He said he's sorry.
You'll just scar them for life.

310
00:24:44,122 --> 00:24:46,826
Scar them?
That boy almost lost his arm.

311
00:24:47,168 --> 00:24:48,546
But he's just a boy.

312
00:24:48,609 --> 00:24:50,383
He will be a man sooner than you think.

313
00:24:50,414 --> 00:24:53,217
And this is a lesson I do not want them
ever to forget!

314
00:24:54,215 --> 00:24:55,157
Selvan!

315
00:25:43,193 --> 00:25:46,224
<i>.. And so has placed the country
in a state of emergency</i>

316
00:25:46,309 --> 00:25:48,727
<i>Under the directive, the states of Gujarat and Tamil Nadu will be
placed under the direct authority of the central government…</i>

317
00:26:04,474 --> 00:26:07,979
Things changed after
the day of Appa's lesson.

318
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:10,503
The world had lost
some of its enchantment.

319
00:26:11,555 --> 00:26:15,436
School was a bore, nothing
but facts, fractions and French.

320
00:26:15,627 --> 00:26:19,419
Words and patterns
that went on and on without end,

321
00:26:19,835 --> 00:26:22,074
just like my irrational nickname.

322
00:26:27,306 --> 00:26:28,426
I grew restless,

323
00:26:28,448 --> 00:26:32,061
searching for something that might
bring meaning back into my life.

324
00:26:33,806 --> 00:26:35,780
And then, I met Anandi.

325
00:26:44,878 --> 00:26:46,494
Mother made me study music.

326
00:26:46,721 --> 00:26:48,740
And one day, my teacher
came down with the flu.

327
00:26:49,709 --> 00:26:53,540
He asked if I could take his place,
playing rhythms for a dance class.

328
00:27:09,297 --> 00:27:10,411
No!

329
00:27:11,012 --> 00:27:15,618
If you do not concentrate, you cannot
express your love of God through dance.

330
00:27:17,481 --> 00:27:19,604
Feel the ground beneath your feet.

331
00:27:19,676 --> 00:27:22,074
Open your gaze out on to the horizon.

332
00:27:22,454 --> 00:27:27,119
Let that spiritual energy pulse
through you, and out into the world.

333
00:27:27,256 --> 00:27:28,381
Through “Abhinaya”.

334
00:27:29,685 --> 00:27:32,678
Anandi, come to the front, lead them.

335
00:28:16,266 --> 00:28:17,875
Why are you following me?

336
00:28:18,717 --> 00:28:19,414
What?

337
00:28:20,154 --> 00:28:21,636
You were following me.

338
00:28:25,107 --> 00:28:26,765
What does this mean?

339
00:28:28,523 --> 00:28:30,800
In the dance, you went from 'batanka',

340
00:28:31,612 --> 00:28:33,687
which means the forest,

341
00:28:34,047 --> 00:28:36,965
And then you did…
and you did…

342
00:28:38,118 --> 00:28:41,826
'Sanputa', which means
something that is hidden.

343
00:28:42,315 --> 00:28:44,127
Now for that you did this.

344
00:28:45,743 --> 00:28:47,511
And then you did 'Chatura'.

345
00:28:49,031 --> 00:28:52,454
But at the very end, you did… this.

346
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,553
None of the others dancers did that.

347
00:28:56,712 --> 00:28:59,182
What did you mean,
the God of love is hiding in the forest?

348
00:28:59,391 --> 00:29:01,853
No, that also means 'the Lotus flower'.

349
00:29:02,857 --> 00:29:05,930
Lotus flower is hiding in the forest?

350
00:29:06,321 --> 00:29:09,017
Why would a Lotus flower
hide in the forest?

351
00:29:17,086 --> 00:29:18,814
This is Richard Parker.

352
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:22,920
He's the most magnificent creature
we've ever had here.

353
00:29:23,785 --> 00:29:26,005
Look at the way he's turning his head.

354
00:29:28,281 --> 00:29:31,124
Showing off… like a dancer.

355
00:29:31,272 --> 00:29:33,959
No. He heard something.

356
00:29:35,798 --> 00:29:38,662
He is listening, you see?

357
00:29:47,892 --> 00:29:49,937
We have talked about it for some time.

358
00:29:49,938 --> 00:29:51,874
Do you understand what I'm saying?

359
00:29:52,364 --> 00:29:53,189
Pi!

360
00:29:54,966 --> 00:29:56,369
Uh sorry, you've been…

361
00:29:56,821 --> 00:29:57,880
Worried.

362
00:29:58,633 --> 00:30:00,216
For my family.

363
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,601
Our animals are worth far more
abroad than here in India.

364
00:30:03,818 --> 00:30:07,577
And if the town council stops supporting
us, I don't know where we will be.

365
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:10,729
So, it is what we have to do.

366
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:13,036
Do you understand?

367
00:30:15,205 --> 00:30:16,954
I'm sorry, what are you talking about?

368
00:30:17,384 --> 00:30:19,403
We are leaving India.

369
00:30:20,943 --> 00:30:22,121
What?

370
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,830
We are selling the zoo.

371
00:30:26,863 --> 00:30:29,979
The zoo was never ours to sell,
the land belongs to the town.

372
00:30:29,996 --> 00:30:31,257
But the animals are ours.

373
00:30:31,374 --> 00:30:34,467
And if we sell them, we will have
enough to start a new life.

374
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:36,818
But where would we go?

375
00:30:37,403 --> 00:30:38,742
Our life is here, Appa!

376
00:30:38,814 --> 00:30:39,934
Canada.

377
00:30:40,078 --> 00:30:42,819
I have some opportunities
for work in Winnipeg.

378
00:30:42,932 --> 00:30:45,925
I'll be shipping most of the animals
for sale in North America,

379
00:30:46,029 --> 00:30:48,587
we can get freighter passage
for the whole family.

380
00:30:48,852 --> 00:30:51,675
So… It's settled.

381
00:30:52,125 --> 00:30:54,707
We will sail like Columbus.

382
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,812
But Columbus was looking for India!

383
00:31:06,691 --> 00:31:09,681
It takes a lot of work to sell a zoo.

384
00:31:10,206 --> 00:31:14,442
Before we left, Anandi and I had time
enough to break each other's heart.

385
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:18,268
Of course, I'd promised
I would come back one day.

386
00:31:19,781 --> 00:31:20,530
It's funny…

387
00:31:21,314 --> 00:31:24,613
I remember everything else
about our last day.

388
00:31:24,733 --> 00:31:27,132
But I don't remember saying goodbye.

389
00:31:36,213 --> 00:31:37,163
Pi?

390
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:39,661
They're serving dinner below.

391
00:31:52,245 --> 00:31:53,365
Piscine.

392
00:31:54,086 --> 00:31:56,225
You have a whole life ahead of you.

393
00:31:57,511 --> 00:31:59,703
We are doing this for you and Ravi.

394
00:32:02,246 --> 00:32:03,972
Come inside and have some dinner.

395
00:32:13,905 --> 00:32:15,180
Vegetarian, please.

396
00:32:16,833 --> 00:32:19,085
Oh, my sons and I are vegetarians.

397
00:32:19,154 --> 00:32:20,973
Do you have anything-
No no no no no!

398
00:32:21,381 --> 00:32:22,704
Not for gravy.

399
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:24,497
You don't want gravy?

400
00:32:32,069 --> 00:32:33,323
Pas de probleme.

401
00:32:33,591 --> 00:32:34,711
Pardon.

402
00:32:54,099 --> 00:32:55,430
Pas de probleme.

403
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,700
Hello.

404
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:34,584
I am happy Buddhist.

405
00:33:35,072 --> 00:33:38,082
So I eat rice next to gravy.

406
00:33:38,974 --> 00:33:41,647
I'm sure, gravy is not meat.

407
00:33:42,544 --> 00:33:45,394
Is taste. You try?

408
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:09,700
Don't worry.

409
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:15,411
We will have plenty of fresh supplies
after we stop in Manila.

410
00:34:17,574 --> 00:34:20,058
Why give Orange Juice tranquilizers?

411
00:34:21,339 --> 00:34:23,437
He's not gonna cause any trouble.

412
00:34:23,947 --> 00:34:27,262
The stress of traveling
is not good for the animals,

413
00:34:27,276 --> 00:34:29,666
and it helps with the sea sickness.

414
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:34,378
We don't want to be cleaning up,

415
00:34:34,683 --> 00:34:37,254
after a seasick orangutan.

416
00:34:38,259 --> 00:34:39,679
Do we?

417
00:34:46,583 --> 00:34:48,136
My father was a businessman.

418
00:34:48,684 --> 00:34:51,230
He had never tended the animals himself.

419
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:57,508
I realized leaving India must have
been harder for him than it was for me.

420
00:35:03,138 --> 00:35:04,161
So?

421
00:35:05,229 --> 00:35:07,044
Yeah, have I forgotten anything?

422
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:08,774
I think you set the stage,

423
00:35:08,775 --> 00:35:12,351
So far, we have an Indian boy
named after a French swimming pool,

424
00:35:12,378 --> 00:35:14,823
on a Japanese ship full of animals,
heading to Canada.

425
00:35:15,663 --> 00:35:16,867
Yes!

426
00:35:17,165 --> 00:35:20,678
Now we have to send our boy
into the middle of the Pacific, and…

427
00:35:20,789 --> 00:35:22,749
And make me believe in God.

428
00:35:26,517 --> 00:35:29,332
Yeah.
We'll get there.

429
00:35:35,371 --> 00:35:39,856
It was four days out of Manila,
above the Mariana trench,

430
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:41,858
the deepest part on earth.

431
00:35:44,628 --> 00:35:50,777
Our ship, the Simsum, pushed on,
bullishly indifferent to its surroundings.

432
00:35:51,895 --> 00:35:56,994
It moved with the slow massive
confidence of a continent.

433
00:36:34,461 --> 00:36:35,698
Did you hear that, Ravi?

434
00:36:35,699 --> 00:36:37,124
Yes, what do you think?

435
00:36:37,245 --> 00:36:39,070
It's a thunderstorm, let's go and watch.

436
00:36:39,362 --> 00:36:40,699
Are you crazy?

437
00:36:41,225 --> 00:36:43,130
We will get hit by lightning.

438
00:36:43,244 --> 00:36:45,775
No, we won't, it'll hit the bridge first.

439
00:36:47,617 --> 00:36:49,901
Don't tempt the storm, Pi.

440
00:37:45,933 --> 00:37:47,203
Oyé!

441
00:37:47,715 --> 00:37:48,756
Hurray!

442
00:37:52,292 --> 00:37:54,321
God's storm!

443
00:38:46,529 --> 00:38:47,340
Ma!

444
00:38:49,164 --> 00:38:49,971
Apa!

445
00:38:51,769 --> 00:38:52,811
Ravi!

446
00:38:53,592 --> 00:38:55,136
Get out!
Get out!

447
00:39:44,143 --> 00:39:46,017
Please save my family!

448
00:39:46,158 --> 00:39:48,441
Don't scare, okay?
Stay here!

449
00:39:48,713 --> 00:39:50,672
You have to help my family!

450
00:39:56,235 --> 00:39:57,338
We have to help them!

451
00:39:57,966 --> 00:39:59,461
My family is back there!

452
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:01,319
Leave now!

453
00:40:01,416 --> 00:40:02,791
We have to go!

454
00:40:02,954 --> 00:40:04,339
Who let all the animals out, uh?

455
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:06,896
– We have to go now!
– No please, my father!

456
00:40:07,024 --> 00:40:08,606
He's got to go!

457
00:40:31,441 --> 00:40:33,704
There! Look there!

458
00:40:33,705 --> 00:40:36,280
Zebra! Zebra!

459
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:37,384
Hey!

460
00:41:37,815 --> 00:41:40,782
Over here!
Over here!

461
00:42:15,897 --> 00:42:17,376
Richard Parker?

462
00:42:17,648 --> 00:42:18,994
No! No!

463
00:42:20,368 --> 00:42:23,110
No! Go away! Go away!

464
00:44:32,747 --> 00:44:34,651
Ama!

465
00:44:36,165 --> 00:44:37,712
Apa!

466
00:44:38,661 --> 00:44:39,884
Ravi!

467
00:44:42,251 --> 00:44:43,885
I'm sorry.

468
00:44:46,758 --> 00:44:49,856
I'm sorry!

469
00:47:10,455 --> 00:47:12,415
Looks as though your drugs
haven't worn off yet.

470
00:47:28,353 --> 00:47:32,353
Orange Juice!
Orange Juice!

471
00:47:46,221 --> 00:47:48,221
Welcome to Pi's ark.

472
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:14,607
Where is your boy, Orange Juice?

473
00:48:24,762 --> 00:48:28,795
Don't worry.
I bet mother and father found him.

474
00:48:32,763 --> 00:48:34,316
They'll all be here soon.

475
00:48:42,934 --> 00:48:45,758
Hello!

476
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,786
Hello!

477
00:48:53,484 --> 00:48:55,882
Anybody!

478
00:49:59,074 --> 00:50:00,017
No!

479
00:50:00,953 --> 00:50:04,808
Stop it! No!
Stop it! Stop it!

480
00:50:09,069 --> 00:50:10,447
No!

481
00:50:11,884 --> 00:50:13,004
No!

482
00:50:14,915 --> 00:50:16,035
No!

483
00:50:59,548 --> 00:51:01,038
Sorry, Orange Juice,

484
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:03,861
I don't have any sea sickness
medicine for you.

485
00:51:05,655 --> 00:51:06,775
Is it right?

486
00:51:07,851 --> 00:51:09,251
Is it right?

487
00:52:28,027 --> 00:52:29,009
No!

488
00:52:29,552 --> 00:52:30,469
No!

489
00:52:30,868 --> 00:52:33,096
No! No!

490
00:52:52,807 --> 00:52:53,927
Com'on!

491
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:55,499
Com'on!

492
00:52:55,807 --> 00:52:57,115
Com'on!

493
00:57:40,528 --> 00:57:42,508
My name is Pi Patel.

494
00:57:43,470 --> 00:57:45,198
I have been in a shipwreck.

495
00:57:46,545 --> 00:57:49,130
I am on a lifeboat, alone…

496
00:57:51,476 --> 00:57:53,028
with a tiger.

497
00:57:54,801 --> 00:57:56,251
Please send help.

498
00:59:44,036 --> 00:59:45,185
God…

499
00:59:46,209 --> 00:59:48,237
I give myself to You.

500
00:59:49,151 --> 00:59:50,754
I am your vessel.

501
00:59:53,358 --> 00:59:56,554
Whatever comes, I want to know.

502
00:59:59,128 --> 01:00:00,354
Show me.

503
01:00:10,351 --> 01:00:12,623
There are no lines.

504
01:00:17,412 --> 01:00:21,380
Set your house in order,
and dig in for the battle to survive.

505
01:00:22,087 --> 01:00:27,211
Establish a strict schedule for eating,
keeping watch, and getting rest.

506
01:00:27,873 --> 01:00:30,636
Do not drink urine or seawater.

507
01:00:33,048 --> 01:00:36,603
Keep busy, but avoid unnecessary exertion.

508
01:00:39,765 --> 01:00:42,882
The mind can be kept get occupied
by playing card games,

509
01:00:42,957 --> 01:00:45,296
“Twenty Questions” or “Eye Spy”.

510
01:00:48,615 --> 01:00:53,288
Community singing is another
surefire way to lift the spirits.

511
01:00:55,390 --> 01:00:58,223
Telling stories is highly recommended.

512
01:01:02,516 --> 01:01:05,161
Above all, don't lose hope.

513
01:01:14,376 --> 01:01:18,014
Few things can sap the spirit
faster than sea sickness.

514
01:01:19,301 --> 01:01:23,387
Waves are more strongly felt when
the boat turns sideways to the current.

515
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:28,161
A sea anchor is used as a drag
to keep the boats head to the wind.

516
01:01:28,816 --> 01:01:31,368
Proper use of them can increase control,

517
01:01:31,369 --> 01:01:34,175
and reduce sea sickness
during rough seas.

518
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:39,660
For castaways who must share their
lifeboats with large dangerous carnivores,

519
01:01:39,859 --> 01:01:43,069
it's advisable to establish
your territory as your own.

520
01:01:43,554 --> 01:01:45,840
Try this method.
Step 1:

521
01:01:46,124 --> 01:01:48,948
Choose a day when waves
are moderate, but regular.

522
01:01:49,771 --> 01:01:52,667
Step 2: With the lifeboat
facing into the waves,

523
01:01:52,892 --> 01:01:57,198
making the ride as comfortable as
possible, blow your whistle soothingly.

524
01:01:57,772 --> 01:02:01,302
Step 3: Turn the lifeboat
sideways to the waves,

525
01:02:01,305 --> 01:02:04,082
accompanied by harsh,
aggressive use of the whistle.

526
01:02:04,762 --> 01:02:08,710
With sufficient repetition, the animal
will associate the sound of the whistle

527
01:02:08,718 --> 01:02:10,548
with the discomfort of sea sickness.

528
01:02:11,953 --> 01:02:14,697
Similar methods have long
been used by circus trainers,

529
01:02:15,216 --> 01:02:18,103
though they generally
lack access to rough seas.

530
01:02:18,384 --> 01:02:20,912
Let the trumpets blow!

531
01:02:21,186 --> 01:02:24,909
Let the drum-rolls begin!

532
01:02:25,474 --> 01:02:27,735
Prepare to be amazed!

533
01:02:28,454 --> 01:02:33,067
Here it is, for your enjoyment,
and instruction.

534
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:37,183
The show you've been
waiting for all your life,

535
01:02:37,569 --> 01:02:40,168
will soon begin!

536
01:02:42,362 --> 01:02:44,803
Are you ready for the miracle event?

537
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:48,466
Well done! I give to you,

538
01:02:48,738 --> 01:02:52,739
the astounding Bengal tiger!

539
01:03:03,435 --> 01:03:04,638
Hello, Richard Parker.

540
01:03:05,892 --> 01:03:07,642
Sorry for the choppy ride.

541
01:03:42,168 --> 01:03:44,258
Mine! You understand?

542
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:46,370
Yours! Mine!

543
01:03:50,244 --> 01:03:51,490
You understand?

544
01:04:04,154 --> 01:04:08,079
Step 4: Disregard steps 1 through 3.

545
01:04:38,429 --> 01:04:39,742
Here, Richard Parker.

546
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:42,748
I got some water for you.

547
01:04:56,445 --> 01:05:00,934
In the zoo, we fed our tigers
an average of five kilos of meat a day.

548
01:05:01,123 --> 01:05:03,540
Richard Parker will be getting hungry soon.

549
01:05:06,510 --> 01:05:08,096
Tigers are powerful swimmers,

550
01:05:08,477 --> 01:05:09,951
and if he gets hungry enough,

551
01:05:10,013 --> 01:05:13,705
I'm afraid the little bit of water
between us won't be any protection.

552
01:05:14,322 --> 01:05:16,493
I need to find a way to feed him.

553
01:05:17,023 --> 01:05:20,520
I can eat the biscuits, but
God made tigers carnivores,

554
01:05:20,737 --> 01:05:22,441
So I must learn to catch fish.

555
01:05:22,911 --> 01:05:23,907
If I don't,

556
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:28,005
I'm afraid his last meal
will be a skinny vegetarian boy.

557
01:05:37,872 --> 01:05:39,523
Patience!

558
01:08:04,247 --> 01:08:06,552
Wait!
Thinking.

559
01:09:39,382 --> 01:09:41,313
Two cartons of biscuits…

560
01:09:43,475 --> 01:09:45,828
93 cans of water…

561
01:10:57,885 --> 01:10:58,870
I'm sorry.

562
01:11:02,048 --> 01:11:03,761
I'm sorry.

563
01:11:06,264 --> 01:11:08,090
Thank you, Lord Vishnu!

564
01:11:09,128 --> 01:11:13,201
Thank you for coming in the form
of a fish and saving our life!

565
01:11:14,184 --> 01:11:15,268
Thank you!

566
01:13:24,542 --> 01:13:28,189
Of course, I brought all the biscuits
and water on the raft with me,

567
01:13:28,229 --> 01:13:30,049
to keep them safe…

568
01:13:30,668 --> 01:13:31,788
Idiot.

569
01:13:35,239 --> 01:13:38,969
Hunger can change everything you
ever thought you knew about yourself.

570
01:14:29,436 --> 01:14:30,821
Here, it's yours!

571
01:16:52,522 --> 01:16:54,423
It's time to settle this.

572
01:16:55,115 --> 01:16:58,535
If we're going to live together,
we have to learn to communicate.

573
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:02,322
Maybe Richard Parker can't be tamed.

574
01:17:02,521 --> 01:17:05,321
But with God's will, he can be trained.

575
01:18:14,903 --> 01:18:15,876
No!

576
01:18:24,481 --> 01:18:25,256
Good.

577
01:19:45,713 --> 01:19:48,202
Go, Richard Parker.
Go!

578
01:19:49,151 --> 01:19:51,212
Go on home, I'll leave you alone.

579
01:19:51,806 --> 01:19:54,054
I'll respect that, promise.

580
01:19:58,982 --> 01:20:00,656
Go! Come on!

581
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:10,820
Yes!

582
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:49,617
I never thought a small piece of shade
could bring me so much happiness.

583
01:20:50,845 --> 01:20:55,763
That a pile of tools, a bucket,
a knife, a pencil,

584
01:20:55,835 --> 01:20:58,215
might become my greatest treasures,

585
01:20:58,665 --> 01:21:02,939
without knowing Richard Parker was here
might ever bring me peace.

586
01:21:03,446 --> 01:21:04,899
In times like these,

587
01:21:04,904 --> 01:21:09,315
I remember that he has as little
experience of the real world as I do.

588
01:21:10,008 --> 01:21:13,001
We were both raised in a zoo
by the same master.

589
01:21:13,429 --> 01:21:15,027
Now we've been orphaned,

590
01:21:15,407 --> 01:21:17,748
left to face our ultimate master together.

591
01:21:18,716 --> 01:21:22,032
Without Richard Parker,
I would have died by now.

592
01:21:22,409 --> 01:21:24,490
My fear of him keeps me alert.

593
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:28,027
Tending to his needs gives my life focus.

594
01:21:32,918 --> 01:21:34,179
Dolphins.

595
01:21:34,690 --> 01:21:36,390
Hey, Richard Parker!

596
01:21:54,027 --> 01:21:55,423
Hey!

597
01:26:04,923 --> 01:26:08,534
Words are all I have left to hang on to.

598
01:26:08,603 --> 01:26:11,775
Everything mixed up; fragmented.

599
01:26:12,696 --> 01:26:17,180
Can't tell day dreams, night dreams
from reality anymore.

600
01:26:35,862 --> 01:26:37,928
A storm, Richard Parker!

601
01:27:38,562 --> 01:27:41,004
Christ needs you, God!

602
01:27:41,392 --> 01:27:43,552
Longing for his words!

603
01:27:43,706 --> 01:27:47,342
The compassionate!
The merciful!

604
01:27:53,248 --> 01:27:54,500
Come out!

605
01:27:56,243 --> 01:28:00,390
Richard Parker! Come out,
you have to see this!

606
01:28:02,076 --> 01:28:03,764
It's beautiful!

607
01:28:15,061 --> 01:28:18,478
Don't hide yourself!
He's come to us!

608
01:28:19,359 --> 01:28:21,309
It's a vision!

609
01:28:34,491 --> 01:28:38,066
Come on, this is God, Richard Parker!

610
01:28:51,173 --> 01:28:53,847
Why are you scaring him?

611
01:28:55,612 --> 01:28:57,585
I've lost my family,

612
01:28:57,926 --> 01:28:59,959
I've lost everything!

613
01:29:00,294 --> 01:29:04,752
I surrender!
What more do you want?

614
01:29:27,780 --> 01:29:29,654
I'm sorry, Richard Parker.

615
01:32:38,817 --> 01:32:41,151
We're dying, Richard Parker.

616
01:32:45,511 --> 01:32:46,835
I'm sorry.

617
01:33:19,342 --> 01:33:20,831
Amma…

618
01:33:22,540 --> 01:33:24,395
Appa, Ravi.

619
01:33:26,262 --> 01:33:29,232
Appa, Ravi, I'm happy I'm
going to see you soon.

620
01:33:37,933 --> 01:33:40,897
Can you feel the rain?

621
01:34:00,004 --> 01:34:01,287
God…

622
01:34:02,295 --> 01:34:05,038
Thank you for giving me my life.

623
01:34:06,925 --> 01:34:08,509
I'm ready now.

624
01:34:40,143 --> 01:34:41,963
Richard Parker.

625
01:38:50,131 --> 01:38:51,878
Hey. Get away!

626
01:38:52,016 --> 01:38:53,378
It's my bed.

627
01:41:01,633 --> 01:41:03,446
It was a human tooth.

628
01:41:04,310 --> 01:41:06,554
Don't you see the island was carnivorous?

629
01:41:07,300 --> 01:41:10,497
Carnivorous?
Like a Venus fly trap?

630
01:41:10,576 --> 01:41:12,916
Yes. The whole island.

631
01:41:13,597 --> 01:41:17,519
The plants, the water and those pools,
the very ground itself.

632
01:41:18,706 --> 01:41:21,365
During the day, those pools
held fresh water.

633
01:41:21,749 --> 01:41:26,612
But at night, some chemical process
turned the water in those pools into acid.

634
01:41:27,454 --> 01:41:29,624
Acid that dissolved those fish.

635
01:41:29,982 --> 01:41:32,412
That sent the meerkats
scurrying into the trees,

636
01:41:32,413 --> 01:41:34,622
and Richard Parker running to the boat.

637
01:41:34,959 --> 01:41:36,449
But where'd the tooth come from?

638
01:41:37,475 --> 01:41:40,412
Years ago, some poor fellow just like me

639
01:41:40,413 --> 01:41:43,222
must have found himself
stranded on that island.

640
01:41:43,571 --> 01:41:45,998
And like me, he thought
he might stay there forever.

641
01:41:47,037 --> 01:41:51,506
But all that the island gave him by day,
it took away again by night.

642
01:41:53,457 --> 01:41:57,931
To think how many hours he spent,
with only meerkats for company.

643
01:41:58,270 --> 01:42:00,956
How much loneliness taken on him.

644
01:42:00,991 --> 01:42:03,560
All I know is that eventually he died,

645
01:42:03,945 --> 01:42:05,196
and the island digested him,

646
01:42:05,995 --> 01:42:08,114
leaving behind only his teeth.

647
01:42:10,241 --> 01:42:13,015
I saw how my life would end,
if I stayed on that island.

648
01:42:13,720 --> 01:42:15,122
Alone, forgotten.

649
01:42:16,215 --> 01:42:19,903
I had to get back to the world,
or die trying.

650
01:42:24,364 --> 01:42:26,752
I spent the next day preparing the boat.

651
01:42:27,374 --> 01:42:29,439
I filled my stores with fresh water,

652
01:42:29,550 --> 01:42:32,254
ate sea weed until my stomach
could take no more,

653
01:42:32,335 --> 01:42:34,703
and brought as many
meerkats as I could fit

654
01:42:34,704 --> 01:42:37,071
into the storage locker
for Richard Parker.

655
01:42:39,133 --> 01:42:41,235
I couldn't leave without him, of course.

656
01:42:41,236 --> 01:42:42,601
It would be killing him.

657
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:49,710
And so I waited for his return.

658
01:42:50,056 --> 01:42:51,485
I knew he wouldn't be late.

659
01:42:52,147 --> 01:42:54,935
Richard Parker!

660
01:43:08,533 --> 01:43:10,642
No one has seen
that floating island since.

661
01:43:11,212 --> 01:43:14,339
And you won't read about
those trees in any nature book.

662
01:43:14,588 --> 01:43:17,902
And yet, if I hadn't found
those shores, I would have died.

663
01:43:18,564 --> 01:43:24,012
And if I hadn't discovered that tooth,
I would have been lost, alone forever.

664
01:43:24,640 --> 01:43:28,423
Even when God seemed to have
abandoned me, he was watching.

665
01:43:28,998 --> 01:43:32,964
Even when he seemed indifferent
to my suffering, he was watching.

666
01:43:33,376 --> 01:43:37,326
And when I was beyond all hope
of saving, he gave me rest.

667
01:43:37,703 --> 01:43:40,987
That gave me a sign to continue my journey.

668
01:43:53,379 --> 01:43:55,606
By the time we reached the Mexican shore,

669
01:43:55,947 --> 01:43:58,079
I was afraid to let go of the boat.

670
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:02,280
My strength was gone, I was so weak.

671
01:44:02,809 --> 01:44:08,065
I was afraid that in two feet of water,
so close to deliverance, I would drown.

672
01:44:18,138 --> 01:44:22,042
I struggled to shore,
and fell upon the sand.

673
01:44:22,353 --> 01:44:27,191
It was warm and soft, like pressing
my face against the cheek of God.

674
01:44:28,520 --> 01:44:32,089
And somewhere, two eyes were smiling
at having me there.

675
01:44:37,025 --> 01:44:39,769
I was so spent, I could hardly move.

676
01:44:46,538 --> 01:44:48,935
And so Richard Parker went ahead of me.

677
01:44:51,311 --> 01:44:54,951
He stretched his legs,
and walked along the shore.

678
01:44:58,617 --> 01:45:01,207
At the edge of the jungle, he stopped.

679
01:45:02,436 --> 01:45:04,638
I was certain he was going
to look back to me.

680
01:45:05,294 --> 01:45:07,909
Flatten his ears to his head, growl,

681
01:45:08,316 --> 01:45:12,055
that he would bring our relationship
to an end in some way.

682
01:45:13,720 --> 01:45:16,840
But he just stared ahead into the jungle.

683
01:45:21,429 --> 01:45:23,951
And then, Richard Parker,
my fierce companion,

684
01:45:23,952 --> 01:45:26,044
the terrible one who kept me alive…

685
01:45:29,063 --> 01:45:32,396
disappeared forever from my life.

686
01:45:39,013 --> 01:45:42,885
After a few hours, a member
of my own species found me.

687
01:45:43,129 --> 01:45:46,168
He left and returned with a group
who carried me away.

688
01:45:48,509 --> 01:45:50,681
I wept like a child,

689
01:45:50,784 --> 01:45:54,107
not because I was overwhelmed
at having survived, although I was.

690
01:45:56,092 --> 01:45:59,304
I was weeping because
Richard Parker left me…

691
01:45:59,716 --> 01:46:01,894
so unceremoniously.

692
01:46:03,844 --> 01:46:05,475
It broke my heart.

693
01:46:11,636 --> 01:46:13,420
You know, my father was right.

694
01:46:14,421 --> 01:46:17,021
Richard Parker never saw me
as his friend.

695
01:46:18,009 --> 01:46:21,166
After all we had been through,
he didn't even look back.

696
01:46:22,681 --> 01:46:24,750
But I have to believe
there was more in these eyes

697
01:46:24,766 --> 01:46:27,502
than my own reflection
staring back at me.

698
01:46:28,296 --> 01:46:29,973
I know it, I felt it.

699
01:46:31,301 --> 01:46:32,896
Even if I can't prove it.

700
01:46:38,746 --> 01:46:43,385
You know, I've left so much behind…
my family, the zoo, India, Anandi…

701
01:46:44,216 --> 01:46:48,423
I suppose in the end the whole of life
becomes an act of letting go.

702
01:46:48,855 --> 01:46:51,265
But what always hurts the most,

703
01:46:51,970 --> 01:46:55,234
is not taking a moment to say goodbye.

704
01:46:57,270 --> 01:47:01,146
I was never able to thank my father,
for all I'd learnt from him.

705
01:47:01,722 --> 01:47:04,212
To tell him without his lessons…

706
01:47:05,142 --> 01:47:07,605
I would never have survived!

707
01:47:09,694 --> 01:47:11,596
I know Richard Parker's a tiger, but…

708
01:47:11,666 --> 01:47:15,267
I wish I had said:
“It's over, we survived…”

709
01:47:16,173 --> 01:47:20,027
thank you for saving my life.
I love you, Richard Parker.

710
01:47:20,450 --> 01:47:22,825
You'll always be with me…

711
01:47:24,256 --> 01:47:25,765
But I can't be with you.

712
01:47:33,694 --> 01:47:35,360
I don't know what to say.

713
01:47:42,168 --> 01:47:44,841
It's hard to believe, isn't it?

714
01:47:48,146 --> 01:47:49,451
It is a lot to take in…

715
01:47:50,753 --> 01:47:52,620
to figure out what that all means.

716
01:47:53,255 --> 01:47:56,760
No, if it happened, it happened.
Why should it have to mean anything?

717
01:47:58,910 --> 01:48:01,220
But some of it is pretty incredible.

718
01:48:01,995 --> 01:48:04,407
See, I was the only one
who survived the shipwreck.

719
01:48:04,992 --> 01:48:08,168
The Japanese shipping company
sent two men to talk to me,

720
01:48:08,448 --> 01:48:10,822
in the Mexican hospital
where I was recovering.

721
01:48:13,354 --> 01:48:14,965
I still have a copy of the report.

722
01:48:17,598 --> 01:48:19,734
They had insurance claims to settle.

723
01:48:20,907 --> 01:48:23,135
They wanted to find out why the ship sank.

724
01:48:24,753 --> 01:48:26,633
They didn't believe me, either.

725
01:48:29,555 --> 01:48:31,174
Thousands of meerkats,

726
01:48:31,261 --> 01:48:35,071
on an floating carnivorous island,
and no one has ever seen it.

727
01:48:35,182 --> 01:48:37,727
Yes. Just like I told you.

728
01:48:37,991 --> 01:48:39,369
Bananas don't float.

729
01:48:40,999 --> 01:48:44,346
You said the orangutan floated
to you on a bundle of bananas,

730
01:48:44,378 --> 01:48:45,846
but bananas don't float.

731
01:48:47,775 --> 01:48:49,805
Of course they do,
you try it for yourself!

732
01:48:51,426 --> 01:48:55,725
In any case, we are not here
to talk about bananas or meerkats.

733
01:48:55,794 --> 01:48:58,429
Look, I just told a long story,
and I'm very tired.

734
01:48:59,270 --> 01:49:04,110
We are here because a Japanese
cargo ship sank in the Pacific!

735
01:49:04,479 --> 01:49:06,261
Something I'll never forget.

736
01:49:07,986 --> 01:49:09,894
I lost my whole family.

737
01:49:19,362 --> 01:49:21,190
We don't mean to push you.

738
01:49:22,596 --> 01:49:24,629
And you have our deepest sympathies.

739
01:49:25,709 --> 01:49:27,786
But we have come a long way,

740
01:49:27,945 --> 01:49:31,093
and we are no closer to
understanding why the ship sank.

741
01:49:31,133 --> 01:49:32,953
Because I don't know!

742
01:49:33,331 --> 01:49:35,077
I was asleep, something woke me up,

743
01:49:35,078 --> 01:49:37,621
it could have been an explosion,
I can't be sure.

744
01:49:37,953 --> 01:49:39,364
And then the ship sank.

745
01:49:40,152 --> 01:49:41,616
What else do you want from me?

746
01:49:42,089 --> 01:49:44,057
A story that won't
make us look like fools.

747
01:49:44,447 --> 01:49:47,153
We need a simpler story for our report.

748
01:49:47,720 --> 01:49:49,899
One our company can understand.

749
01:49:49,900 --> 01:49:51,937
A story we can all believe.

750
01:49:56,590 --> 01:49:59,176
So a story without things
you've never seen before.

751
01:49:59,676 --> 01:50:00,750
That's right.

752
01:50:01,455 --> 01:50:04,967
Without surprises, without…
animals or islands.

753
01:50:05,689 --> 01:50:08,357
Yes. The truth.

754
01:50:16,588 --> 01:50:19,314
So… what did you do?

755
01:50:23,870 --> 01:50:25,318
I told them another story.

756
01:50:26,980 --> 01:50:28,889
Four of us survived,

757
01:50:29,077 --> 01:50:31,085
the cook and the sailor
were already aboard.

758
01:50:31,724 --> 01:50:33,682
The cook threw me a life buoy
and pull me aboard,

759
01:50:33,696 --> 01:50:36,842
and Mother held on some bananas
and made it to the life boat.

760
01:50:38,935 --> 01:50:42,062
The cook… was a disgusting man.

761
01:50:42,115 --> 01:50:43,646
He ate a rat!

762
01:50:44,694 --> 01:50:45,989
We had food enough for weeks,

763
01:50:46,013 --> 01:50:48,428
but he found the rat in the
first few days and he killed it,

764
01:50:48,809 --> 01:50:50,768
he dried it in the sun and ate it.

765
01:50:51,943 --> 01:50:53,528
Such a brute, that man.

766
01:50:55,749 --> 01:50:58,031
But he was resourceful.

767
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:01,815
It was his idea to build
the raft to catch fish,

768
01:51:02,640 --> 01:51:05,424
we would have died in those
first few days without him.

769
01:51:08,069 --> 01:51:11,992
The sailor was the same man who
brought rice and gravy, the Buddhist.

770
01:51:12,707 --> 01:51:16,214
We didn't understand much what he said,
only that he was suffering.

771
01:51:16,523 --> 01:51:18,757
He'd broken his leg horribly in the fall.

772
01:51:19,074 --> 01:51:22,077
We tried to set it as best we could,
but the leg became infected.

773
01:51:22,410 --> 01:51:26,333
And the cook said that we had
to do something, but he… died.

774
01:51:27,488 --> 01:51:30,701
The cook said he'd do it, but mother
and I had to hold the man down.

775
01:51:30,826 --> 01:51:33,512
And I believed him, we needed to do it.

776
01:51:34,182 --> 01:51:35,302
So…

777
01:51:38,238 --> 01:51:40,575
I kept saying “I'm sorry, I'm sorry”.

778
01:51:41,140 --> 01:51:44,739
He just kept looking at me,
his eyes were so…

779
01:51:48,258 --> 01:51:50,828
I'll never understand the point
of that man's suffering.

780
01:51:52,757 --> 01:51:54,488
I can still hear him,

781
01:51:55,012 --> 01:51:58,319
A happy Buddhist who
only ate rice and gravy

782
01:52:03,991 --> 01:52:07,275
We didn't save him, of course.
He died.

783
01:52:09,058 --> 01:52:11,047
The morning after the cook
got his first dorado

784
01:52:11,048 --> 01:52:13,412
and I didn't understand
what he'd done at first,

785
01:52:13,548 --> 01:52:16,357
but Mother did, and I had never
seen Mother so angry.

786
01:52:18,253 --> 01:52:20,162
“Stop whining and be happy”, he said.

787
01:52:20,163 --> 01:52:23,154
“We need more food or we'll die,
thas was the whole point!”

788
01:52:23,189 --> 01:52:24,762
“What was the whole point”, mother asked?

789
01:52:25,119 --> 01:52:28,645
You let that poor boy die
in order to get bait, you monster!

790
01:52:30,967 --> 01:52:34,003
He got furious, he started
towards her with his fists raised,

791
01:52:34,086 --> 01:52:36,886
And Mother slapped him hard
right across the face!

792
01:52:37,222 --> 01:52:38,521
I was stunned!

793
01:52:39,194 --> 01:52:42,720
I thought he was going to
kill her right then.

794
01:52:43,126 --> 01:52:44,584
But he didn't…

795
01:52:46,627 --> 01:52:49,465
The cook didn't stop
with bait either, no…

796
01:52:51,042 --> 01:52:52,523
The sailor…

797
01:52:54,255 --> 01:52:56,761
he went the same way the rat went.

798
01:52:59,091 --> 01:53:01,755
The cook was a resourceful man.

799
01:53:05,901 --> 01:53:07,828
It was a week later that he…

800
01:53:09,723 --> 01:53:11,147
because of me.

801
01:53:12,033 --> 01:53:14,545
Because I couldn't hold on
this stupid turtle.

802
01:53:15,684 --> 01:53:17,710
It slipped out of my hands and swam away,

803
01:53:18,284 --> 01:53:20,626
and the cook came up, and he punched me
on the side of my head,

804
01:53:20,627 --> 01:53:22,860
and my teeth clacked and I saw stars,

805
01:53:23,118 --> 01:53:25,849
I thought he was going to hit me again,
but Mother started pounding on him,

806
01:53:25,943 --> 01:53:28,106
with her fists, screaming
“monster, monster!”

807
01:53:28,252 --> 01:53:29,776
She yelled at me to go to the raft.

808
01:53:29,830 --> 01:53:31,382
“Ni po da!”

809
01:53:31,669 --> 01:53:34,030
I thought she was coming with me,
or I'd never have!

810
01:53:37,694 --> 01:53:39,844
I don't know why
I didn't make her go first.

811
01:53:42,211 --> 01:53:44,033
I think about that every day.

812
01:53:50,473 --> 01:53:53,680
I jumped over and turned back
just as the knife came out.

813
01:53:58,294 --> 01:53:59,984
There wasn't anything I could do.

814
01:54:02,589 --> 01:54:04,169
Couldn't look away…

815
01:54:08,843 --> 01:54:10,835
He threw her body overboard,

816
01:54:12,813 --> 01:54:14,346
and then the sharks came.

817
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:16,524
And I saw her, they…

818
01:54:21,105 --> 01:54:22,131
saw…

819
01:54:28,645 --> 01:54:30,323
Next day, I killed him.

820
01:54:33,491 --> 01:54:36,308
He didn't even fight back,
he knew he'd gone too far.

821
01:54:36,497 --> 01:54:37,928
Even by his own standards.

822
01:54:40,537 --> 01:54:44,155
He left the knife out on the bench, and
I did to him what he did to the sailor.

823
01:54:48,070 --> 01:54:50,811
He was such an evil man,
but worse still he…

824
01:54:53,212 --> 01:54:54,931
He brought the evil out in me!

825
01:54:57,448 --> 01:54:58,773
And I have to live with that.

826
01:55:06,424 --> 01:55:08,644
I was alone in the lifeboat…

827
01:55:10,176 --> 01:55:12,522
drifting across the Pacific ocean…

828
01:55:13,715 --> 01:55:15,001
and I survived.

829
01:55:20,641 --> 01:55:22,834
After that, they had no more questions.

830
01:55:24,235 --> 01:55:27,387
The investigators didn't seem
to like the story, exactly.

831
01:55:28,065 --> 01:55:31,358
They thanked me.
They wished me well…

832
01:55:31,644 --> 01:55:32,810
and they left.

833
01:55:39,738 --> 01:55:41,616
So the story is…

834
01:55:44,255 --> 01:55:46,116
Both the zebra and the sailor…

835
01:55:46,975 --> 01:55:48,095
broke their leg.

836
01:55:49,392 --> 01:55:51,874
And a hyena killed the zebra
and the orangutan.

837
01:55:52,963 --> 01:55:54,566
So…

838
01:55:54,905 --> 01:55:56,469
The hyena is the cook…

839
01:55:57,482 --> 01:55:59,400
the sailor is the zebra…

840
01:56:00,070 --> 01:56:02,031
your mother is the orangutan.

841
01:56:03,155 --> 01:56:03,949
And…

842
01:56:04,597 --> 01:56:05,697
you're…

843
01:56:07,017 --> 01:56:08,273
the tiger.

844
01:56:14,222 --> 01:56:15,680
Can I ask you something?

845
01:56:17,622 --> 01:56:18,715
Of course.

846
01:56:19,485 --> 01:56:22,891
I told you two stories about
what happened out in the ocean…

847
01:56:23,505 --> 01:56:26,235
Neither explains what caused
the sinking of the ship.

848
01:56:27,005 --> 01:56:30,261
And no one can prove
which story is true and which is not.

849
01:56:31,227 --> 01:56:37,043
In both stories, the ship sinks,
my family dies, and I suffer.

850
01:56:37,773 --> 01:56:38,683
True.

851
01:56:42,033 --> 01:56:43,774
So which story do you prefer?

852
01:56:51,474 --> 01:56:53,235
The one with the tiger.

853
01:56:54,706 --> 01:56:56,213
That's the better story.

854
01:57:00,319 --> 01:57:01,906
Thank you.

855
01:57:02,640 --> 01:57:04,745
And so it goes with God.

856
01:57:16,882 --> 01:57:18,461
Mamaji was right.

857
01:57:19,770 --> 01:57:21,769
It's an amazing story.

858
01:57:23,472 --> 01:57:25,349
Will you really let me write it?

859
01:57:25,588 --> 01:57:26,622
Of course.

860
01:57:27,003 --> 01:57:29,960
Isn't that why Mamaji
sent you here, after all?

861
01:57:34,177 --> 01:57:35,649
My wife is here.

862
01:57:35,824 --> 01:57:38,250
Do you want to stay for dinner?
She's an incredible cook!

863
01:57:38,289 --> 01:57:39,511
I didn't know you had a wife.

864
01:57:39,583 --> 01:57:41,268
And a cat and two children.

865
01:57:42,381 --> 01:57:44,415
So your story does have an happy ending.

866
01:57:45,345 --> 01:57:47,839
Well… that's up to you.

867
01:57:48,327 --> 01:57:50,626
The story is yours now.

868
01:58:07,811 --> 01:58:10,575
“Mr. Patel's is an astounding story.”

869
01:58:11,076 --> 01:58:15,204
Of courage and endurance,
unparalleled in the history of shipwrecks.

870
01:58:15,397 --> 01:58:19,135
Very few castaways can claim
to have survived so long at sea.

871
01:58:19,774 --> 01:58:21,812
And none in the company…

872
01:58:22,552 --> 01:58:25,494
of an adult Bengal tiger.

873
01:58:27,951 --> 01:58:29,219
– Hi, Dad.
– Get in.

874
01:58:29,404 --> 01:58:31,652
We have a guest, let me introduce you.

875
01:58:33,517 --> 01:58:35,582
Hi.
Very nice to meet you.

876
01:58:35,725 --> 01:58:36,845
Adika.

877
01:58:37,993 --> 01:58:39,023
Ravi.

878
01:58:39,048 --> 01:58:41,048
