1
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,876
I know, but it's coming.

2
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:45,503
When is it?

3
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,632
lt's not gonna be too much longer.

4
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:00,977
Spit your gum out. Come on. Thank you.

5
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:27,003
Oh, here comes the train!

6
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:35,386
Get behind me. Ally, stay behind me.

7
00:01:35,471 --> 00:01:36,679
Just take it. Take it.

8
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:39,015
Give me your purse. Give me your purse.

9
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,350
-Give me the ring!
-What?

10
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,019
-Don't talk.
-lt's gonna be okay.

11
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,857
-Ally, don't look at them. No, no...
-Better not, lady.

12
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:51,986
This is the Coney lsland-bound F train.

13
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,155
Next stop Avenue I.

14
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:04,540
No!

15
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:09,253
Mom! Mom!

16
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:14,926
Mom! Mom! Mom!

17
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:18,888
Mom! Mom!

18
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,640
Mom!

19
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:39,468
Daddy!

20
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,533
Hello?

21
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,661
Fifteen minutes.

22
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,895
-How are you, Mom?
-You look good.

23
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,443
-How you doing, Les?
-Good to see you.

24
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:05,614
Thanks for the wake-up call, Maestro.

25
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,617
You smell like Listerine and beer.

26
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,125
You couldn't wear a tie?

27
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,211
l could have.

28
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:44,070
This is nice. Michael would like

29
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:46,655
that we still do this.

30
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:54,789
Did you tell Tyler what your art teacher said
about your portrait?

31
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:55,998
Mom!

32
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,541
Tell him!

33
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:03,631
She said l captured the moment
like a young James Whistler.

34
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:07,510
Well, at least
it's a young James Whistler,

35
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:12,181
because, God, l mean, Whistler,
he fell off in the latter half of his career.

36
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:16,352
He is the Boyz ll Men
of European art history.

37
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:20,272
She recommended your sister
to Steinhardt's Summer Art lntensive,

38
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:23,484
-and that's hugely prestigious.
-lt's fantastic.

39
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:24,693
lt's great.

40
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:29,949
l'm going to do a drawing called
"My Brother and His Favorite Cigarette."

41
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:34,745
And, since l'd be the youngest person ever,
practically, to be studying there...

42
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,955
Tyler,

43
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,541
would you please pass the sugar?

44
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:49,093
She still has a couple of minutes left
on the clock, Dad.

45
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,179
Just a couple of seconds.

46
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:57,476
Caroline's perfectly capable of speaking up
if she's feeling slighted in any way.

47
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:00,187
Have l slighted you in any way, Caroline?

48
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:02,565
l'm fine.

49
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:10,656
-l didn't mean to change the subject.
-What was the subject?

50
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:12,908
Excuse me?

51
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:15,411
The subject we were discussing.
What was it?

52
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:18,455
Now is not the time for your heroics, Tyler.

53
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:21,083
Actually, now is the perfect time.

54
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:25,045
-All right. l gotta go.
-Tyler.

55
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,339
Caroline, do you want me
to take you anywhere?

56
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:30,551
-l'm okay. l'll stay with Mom.
-All right. l'll see you soon.

57
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,013
The sugar.

58
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:57,620
Eat something.

59
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:09,381
Gandhi said that
whatever you do in Iife wiII be insignificant,

60
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,719
but it's very important that you do it.

61
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:17,973
I tend to agree with the first part.

62
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:24,813
MichaeI, you know what day I'm staring at.

63
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:29,485
By 22, Gandhi had three kids,

64
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,863
Mozart, 30 symphonies,

65
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,325
and Buddy HoIIy was dead.

66
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,209
You once told me,

67
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:49,171
"Our fingerprints don't fade
from the lives we touch."

68
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,093
Is that true for everybody?

69
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:57,263
Or was that just poetic bullshit?

70
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:00,182
l sold your girlfriend a toothbrush.

71
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:05,980
-You sold my who? What?
-You know, your girlfriend.

72
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:09,233
That voluptuous,
delightfully oblivious little blonde

73
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,567
you left in your bed yesterday?

74
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:12,903
-Yeah.
-Yeah, l sold her a toothbrush.

75
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:14,780
l got three bucks.

76
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,783
-Congratulations.
-Yeah, are in order.

77
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,452
'Cause that sale inspired
our newest business venture.

78
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:22,037
The S.L.U.T.

79
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,290
lt's a Single Lady's Universal Tote.

80
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:27,376
lt's a one-night-stand travel pack
for women. You know?

81
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:32,548
We throw in makeup and toiletries,
a cell phone charger, cab numbers...

82
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,759
We retail it for $1 9.95.
Maybe we'd do an infomercial.

83
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:40,180
Do you think women will buy this
with actual money?

84
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,142
Okay. Yeah.
You know what? Fine. Be cynical.

85
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,977
But think about it, at one point in history,

86
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,938
two people had a conversation,
a lot like this one, about the light bulb.

87
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:49,565
One went on to fame and fortune,

88
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,526
the other probably went to work
at Mickey D's or something.

89
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:56,530
ln the wake of recent terrorist attacks,

90
00:10:56,614 --> 00:11:00,784
do you guys think there's a place
for a discussion about ethics

91
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:04,496
when we're talking about
the root causes of terrorism?

92
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,541
Wasn't it a moral question,
not an ethical one?

93
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:11,128
-How so?
-Well, morals define personal character.

94
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,254
And ethics?

95
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,423
The standards of behavior expected
by a group.

96
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:17,051
And in the end,
personal character is more important?

97
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:19,803
-Absolutely.
-That's a good point.

98
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:23,932
Does knowledge of the past
limit us or benefit us?

99
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:28,312
Can we make this
a non-smoking statue?

100
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:32,775
Yeah, Tyler.
Can we make this a non-smoking statue?

101
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:37,738
-You promised you'd quit.
-l know.

102
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:52,086
Why do you think Dad
doesn't wanna listen to me?

103
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:56,965
-Dad loves you.
-So?

104
00:11:57,467 --> 00:12:00,636
You can love someone
and not want to spend time with them.

105
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:05,557
-Yeah, you got that right.
-Mom loves Aunt Sara.

106
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:07,726
But at Christmas last year,

107
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:10,396
she wouldn't let Les leave them
in a room together

108
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,441
'cause she said that there'd be
a "Yuletide homicide."

109
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:18,320
That's 'cause Aunt Sara drinks.
You don't drink, do you?

110
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,656
l'm 11 .

111
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:25,911
So why would anyone ever want
to avoid you?

112
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,500
Michael used to drink.

113
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:35,504
That's 'cause Michael was 21 .

114
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:42,428
When you're 21 , drinking's new
and exciting, and everybody does it.

115
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,723
Aunt Sara drinks
'cause she wishes she was 21 .

116
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,184
You're 21 .

117
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:52,688
Okay.

118
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:02,156
Hey, what about Atlantic City
for your birthday this year, man?

119
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,284
-Really?
-Yeah. We'll get a suite.

120
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,870
You could call Toothbrush Girl.

121
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:11,832
l think l'd rather be sodomized
with a toothbrush than that.

122
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,461
lt's your day, man.
We can work something out.

123
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,672
The schematic for these particular shelves

124
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:22,217
is of authors who have slept together
and ended up dead or in prison.

125
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:24,052
No shit?

126
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,304
Shit.

127
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,016
See, that's why chicks dig you, man.

128
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:32,895
No, seriously.
They love this freaky poetic crap.

129
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:36,482
Oh! l ran into Megan yesterday.

130
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:39,401
She's bartending at Don Hill's tonight, man.
Wants us to stop by.

131
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:43,447
She practically begged me.
Yeah, poor thing.

132
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,450
Hey!

133
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,287
-Hey!
-"Hey," nothing, man! What's...

134
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:52,664
What?

135
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:58,253
All right, look, you've been a ghost
the past couple of weeks, all right?

136
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:00,422
You never wanna go out anymore.

137
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:05,886
l've had enough
of this brooding introvert shit, okay?

138
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:08,347
l'm ready to set up an intervention here.

139
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:10,599
What?

140
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:16,063
You do realize that interventions
typically don't involve binge drinking.

141
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:18,524
Look, one drink.

142
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:23,195
-Okay? Just one.
-When was the last time you had one drink?

143
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:28,700
Communion.

144
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:37,543
Megan! Megan. Wow! You look great!

145
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:40,587
Do not speak.

146
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:44,132
Okay. Two beers?

147
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:46,218
ls she mad at me or something?

148
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,972
She's not mad. That's how people act
when they're really into you.

149
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,891
-Yeah.
-Excuse me?

150
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:53,976
Oh!

151
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:58,313
-Hello. Excuse me. Hi.
-Could you get a picture for us?

152
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:01,400
Yeah, sure. l just push the button?

153
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,694
-Turn it...
-You gotta go the other way.

154
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,320
Beautiful.

155
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,489
Save that for your collection.

156
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,283
So, what are you girls drinking?

157
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:10,867
-Mojitos!
-Mojitos!

158
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:16,039
No, no, no, l'm not saying
there's anything wrong with any other city.

159
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:18,875
l'm just saying that this
is the greatest city in the world.

160
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,627
All right? l love this street!

161
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:23,755
l love this street! Where are you guys from?

162
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,424
-Miami.
-Miami.

163
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:29,803
That was great. You did it in unison.
Miami. That's a big suck fest.

164
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:33,265
No, this is the greatest city.
l don't know, like Barcelona, Rio,

165
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,768
-they got nothing on this town.
-What are we doing? l'm freezing.

166

-Should have worn a coat.
-Michael!

00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,281
-lt's warm in here.
-Get your hands off my car!

170
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,324
What's your problem, asshole?

171
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:52,159
-you'd be warmer if you snuggle up.
-Asshole!

172
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:53,410
What the hell?

173
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,746
-Get back in your car.
-Yeah?

174
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,372
-What?
-Go back to Long lsland

175
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:00,167
-where you come from.
-l'm from Queens, asshole!

176
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:01,543
Shut the hell up, Yank.

177
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,879
Why don't you go back
to England, huh?

178
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,797
Hey, you wanna go back
to my hotel room?

179
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:08,008
-That's my bloody guitar!
-Eat shit and die!

180
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,551
Whoa!

181
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,185
-Tyler...

182
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:19,519
-l'm gonna go.
-Tyler!

183
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:22,147
-Let's go...

184
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,107
-Come here!
-Don't walk over there.

185
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,400
-Get off me!

00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,579
Hold him down!

190
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,541
No, l really think that it's done.

191
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,710
-lt's not bleeding as much.
-Here you go, ma'am.

192

193
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:50,342
Listen, Officer, those two were with us.
They were just trying to stop it.

194
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:54,137
Leo. Cut those two loose.

195
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:57,265
Curly, turn around.

196
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,602
-Anything in here gonna stab me?
-Nope.

197
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:02,104
Get out ofjail free.

198
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:06,108
You're very, very lucky my partner
is on a tear.

199
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,278
-How about you two?
-lt wasn't us, man.

200
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,906
-Take a hike.
-That scumbag kicked my car!

201
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,200
-Shut up, genius.
-Eat shit, wanker!

202
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:18,161
All right! That's it! Everybody's going!

203
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:19,788
-What? You're bloody shitting me!
-Come on!

204
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,790
-Hey! Hey!
-They attacked us!

205
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,167
These two didn't do anything.

206
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:27,295
-lt was everything was these assholes.
-Hey, star witness, shut up!

207
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,880
What are you still doing here?

208
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:33,885
This is bullshit. These two guys
were just walking across the street.

209
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:38,306
Well, Mr. Hawkins,
what makes you think l give a shit?

210
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,392
'Cause you're a cop.

211
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:44,938
-You're supposed to give a shit.
-You hear that, Leo?

212
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:49,443
That's a great relief to me, Mr. Hawkins,
to know that you're on top of the situation.

213
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:51,278
Now, go home!

214
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,280
-Take a hike, fellas.
-Why don't you...

215
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:54,448
What...

216
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:09,880
Hey, pretty boy,
you ready to grab your ankles?

217
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:11,506
Come here, sweet potato.

218
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:15,927
You can have your call now.

219
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:19,014
No, l'm good. l'm good.
Don't worry about it.

220
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,058
-You all right?
-You're good?

221
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:24,102
You're good?

222
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:25,896
Okay. Now, thank God you're good.

223
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,940
'Cause l wouldn't want you to get upset
about anything, like being in jail.

224
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,400
l wouldn't want you to worry about that.

225
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,154
You want to tell me what you were doing?

226
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:38,283
l would like to know. You wanna tell me
what you wanted from that cop guy?

227
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:40,410
Nothing. lt was just a messed-up situation.
l mean...

228
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:42,579
Yeah, l'll say.
lt was frigging stupid, is what it was.

229
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:46,625
These guys, you know, they're just pussies.

230
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:48,543
You pussies!

231
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:52,339
That's great. That's good.
Okay, Green Hornet... Lantern.

232
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:54,216
Asshole!

233
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,304
You know what? You might actually
be having a nice time

234
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:03,266
not matriculating in school.
But l actually would like to graduate.

235
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:05,894
lt must be nice living
at the bookstore by yourself

236
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,562
with all your stacks of books and all that,

237
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:11,441
but, see, l actually plan on having a career,
and a wife, and a girlfriend,

238
00:19:11,526 --> 00:19:12,943
and, l don't know, a divorce

239
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:15,821
and a mid-life stalking episode,
and erectile dysfunction.

240
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:17,989
-Little bitch!
-Shut up!

241
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:19,324
-Faggot!
-Asshole!

242
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,535
-So l will thank you, as a friend...
-Shut up!

243
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:25,163
...to keep your complexes
and your nihilistic bullshit to yourself!

244
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:29,334
-Did you just say "nihilistic"?
-Yeah! All right? l got it off a cereal box!

245
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,294
Hawkins. Hall.

246
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,506
-Oh, you...
-Yeah.

247
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,883
l called your dad. Sue me.

248
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,052
-Good boy.
-We didn't do anything!

249
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,096
Hey, nice to meet you.

250
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,056
ls she looking for a roommate?

251
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,100
ln the city?

252
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:46,601
Really?

253
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:50,647
Hey, l gotta go, but l'll call you back.

254
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,274
Okay. Bye.

255
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:03,535
So, what'd you tell me
you were gonna do when things got tight?

256
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,122
What, breathe?

257
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:10,667
-Did you?
-l did. l'm breathing right now.

258
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:16,172
-Who was that?
-Marie.

259
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:17,799
Oh.

260
00:20:18,593 --> 00:20:20,802
-How is she?
-She's good.

261
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,513
Mrs. Lippman's gonna drive me.

262
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,266
No. l'll drive you.

263
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,198
Hey.

264
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:47,329
This drive is too long.

265
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:15,941
You know you can't smoke in here.

266
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,487
Why do you have an ashtray?

267
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:24,074
lt's a bowl. lt completes the room.

268
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:26,826
Good morning,
Hawkins, Stevens, Jacob.

269
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,378
This is a bowl?

270
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,800
-Well, l'm sorry.
-Tyler.

271
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:46,096
l guess it was just here to tease me.

272
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:51,017
-Hey, Janine.
-He's ready for you.

273
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,729
-You okay?
-Yeah.

274
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:57,107
-Really?
-Yeah, l'm fine, Janine.

275
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:59,651
You look like hell,
and you smell like beer and cigarettes.

276
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:02,404
-Thank you.
-You want me to lie to you?

277
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,115
Try not to give him a heart attack.

278
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,747
l only came to see how much it cost.
l'm gonna pay you back.

279
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:18,461
-How much what costs?
-The lawyer.

280
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:19,546
Ah.

281
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:26,594
That lawyer, Tyler, costs $450 an hour.

282
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:28,346
Oh, for Christ sake.

283
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:30,890
Tell me about it.

284
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:36,938
l just wanted you to know
that l didn't call you.

285
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,565
lt wasn't me.

286
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:43,653
You could do worse
than have a father who bails you out ofjail.

287
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,864
That's not even...

288
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,703
l don't want to be bailed out of anything.

289
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,621
l'll get an invoice from Janine.

290
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:11,806
Hey, Michael,

291
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:15,143
remember that Greek myth you read to me

292
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:18,605
about the god who banished
all his children to the underworld,

293
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:23,902
and how his youngest son,
to get even, castrated him with a sickIe?

294
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:28,239
It's a IittIe excessive, maybe,

295
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:31,409
but I get it.

296
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:41,961
You're so weird.

297
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:46,674
Caroline, we have to go
to surgery right now.

298
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,764
What did you do to your face?

299
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:56,643
l had a horrible threshing accident.

300
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,105
-lt was horrible.
-lt was so horrible.

301
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:03,274
-The worst.
-You're so retarded.

302
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:07,904
Hey, l got you something.

303
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:12,283
This is my favorite book, ever.

304
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:15,870
Michael used to hit me over the head
repeatedly with it until l read it.

305
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:22,127
lt's about all these gods and goddesses
who go around acting jealous and petty,

306
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:24,462
and otherwise like regular human beings.

307
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:29,384
-lllustrations are pretty cool.
-Yeah. These are cool.

308
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:31,928
Thanks.

309
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:35,765
Uh...

310
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:38,726
-Where are we meeting Mom?
-The Guggenheim.

311
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,772
What's up with these girls?

312
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:46,901
They think l'm weird.

313
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:50,321
Sometimes l sort of space out.

314
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,908
What, when you're drawing?

315
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:58,746
Yeah. Other times, too.

316
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:05,753
Mademoiselle Fleishman had
to snap her fingers at me a lot today,

317
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,757
and everybody laughed.

318
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:13,636
They all think l'm a freak of nature.

319
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:16,764
Mademoiselle Fleishman.

320
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:22,604
Ma petite soeurette, une freak of nature.

321
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:27,859
French toast.

322
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:30,778
What are you gonna tell Mom
about your face?

323
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,407
-"l finally found something l'm good at"?
-Really?

324
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:35,950
-l have a class now.
-l know.

325
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:37,702
-Are you listening? l have a class now.
-l know

326
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,454
by all numerical measurements,
l didn't pass.

327
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:42,874
But l was hoping that maybe you could
give me a grade on my trying-to-pass,

328
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,251
my commitment to effort. lt's...

329
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:48,504
My commitment to commitment. You know?

330
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:52,550
l don't... Look, l'm not... l mean...

331
00:25:52,635 --> 00:25:54,802
-Patricia. Can l call you Patricia?
-No.

332
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:57,639
l... Life is about people and...

333
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:03,102
And it's about what people put into people.
And l wanna put something into you.

334
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:04,938
And l... Not... l don't wanna...

335
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:08,566
l won't put anything into you. l just wanna...
You look great. l love that jacket.

336
00:26:08,651 --> 00:26:11,486
l will... l will say you're an angel, Patricia!
An angel!

337
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:18,201
He has got a daughter!

338
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:21,996
-Who's got a daughter?
-The cop!

339
00:26:22,873 --> 00:26:25,833
The cop that busted your face all up.
He's got a daughter.

340
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:28,461
What do you want me to do? Kidnap her?

341
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:31,547
Of course not!
We don't have closet space for that.

342
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:35,343
Just introduce yourself.
You know, go on a few dates. l don't know.

343
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:38,930
Be your charming, gentlemanly self,
and then flip the script on her.

344
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:42,141
-What's "flip the script"?
-Screw her brains out.

345
00:26:42,226 --> 00:26:44,310
Make her call you Daddy, l don't know.

346
00:26:44,395 --> 00:26:46,813
Just steal her panties
and sell them on eBay,

347
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:48,398
or post them on her high school's
home page.

348
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:50,149
l don't know. Just be creative.

349
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:53,820
Yeah, you should be incarcerated
just on general principle.

350
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:58,574
-l was incarcerated. You might remember?
-Yeah.

351
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:01,244
You tell me you don't wanna get back
at this asshole, and l'll drop it.

352
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:02,495
Where's the trash?

353
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,623
l don't wanna get back at this asshole.

354
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:07,500
-Just meet her.
-l don't wanna meet her.

355
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:09,252
-She's cute.
-l don't care.

356
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:10,878
-You're meeting her.
-No, l'm not.

357
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:12,297
-Yeah, you are.
-No, l'm not.

358
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:13,548
Are, too.

359
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,009
Look, just meet her.

360
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,471
This is one of those things
that l'm already regretting.

361
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:22,223
All right, she was here the other day.

362
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:25,601
l don't care. What do you want me to say?

363
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:28,104
"Hey, doll face, your dad trampled
all over my civil liberties.

364
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:30,023
"You wanna make out with me?"

365
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:32,358
Don't call her "doll face"!

366
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:33,901
Moron.

367
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:35,862
-Look, l'm leaving.
-Would you...

368
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:38,114
Look. All right, there she is.

369
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:40,241
-Who?
-The blonde.

370
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,204
l know her. She's...

371
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:49,375
l don't know her,
but she's in my global politics class.

372
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:52,587
There you go! Something to open up with.
All right?

373
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,297
Go get her.

374
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,520
Excuse me? Can l bother you for a sec?

375
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:12,440
You're already bothering me.

376
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:19,614
Listen, l'm doing
this sociological experiment,

377
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:22,075
and l was just wondering
if you could help me out for a second.

378
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:24,285
You're kidding me, right?

379
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:26,996
Can l ask your name?

380
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,500
Anonymous.

381
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:33,419
Anonymous. ls that Greek?

382
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:38,716
Okay, Anonymous,

383
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:41,761
you see the guy sitting over there,

384
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:45,181
pretending to read a textbook,
looking in this general direction?

385
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:48,768
Yeah, he's staring at us. Subtle.

386
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:54,023
l have this theory that an objective
third party such as yourself

387
00:28:54,108 --> 00:28:57,860
could determine how much of an asshole
he is just by looking at him.

388
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:02,990
See, l'm his roommate, and l think
l've witnessed too many glaring examples

389
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:08,704
of assoholic behavior
that l'm biased as a subject.

390
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:13,084
But l'm convinced that he has an aura
that you can actually perceive.

391
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:16,295
Who else do you plan on asking?

392
00:29:17,548 --> 00:29:21,175
l don't know. l don't think anybody else
here fits the criteria.

393
00:29:22,136 --> 00:29:24,011
Attractive, early-twenties female...

394
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:27,682
-Ah! Nineteen.
-Nineteen. l'm...

395
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:31,185
That's fine. Teens. l can do teens.

396
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,022
Okay.

397
00:29:37,151 --> 00:29:40,903
Well, typically, you get something
for being involved in one of these surveys.

398
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:45,867
l ran out of my foam fingers
a while back, so...

399
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:49,579
l don't know,
can l take you out to dinner or something?

400
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:54,959
Or maybe just have a conversation
on the off-chance

401
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:57,545
one of us says something interesting?

402
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:03,342
Yeah, see, there is a problem, though,
because l don't date sociology majors.

403
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:06,429
Lucky for you, l'm undecided. So...

404
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:09,891
About what?

405
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:14,145
Everything.

406
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:23,404
l'm Ally.

407
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:26,908
Ally.

408
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,164
Don't be mad!

409
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:38,252
Dad, we've seen Ern Brockovich
twice already. You cried both times.

410
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:41,756
-l did not.
-lt's embarrassing.

411
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:58,731
-Hello?
-Hello.

412
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:02,944
-Hey, it's TyIer.
-Hi.

413
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:08,449
You're gonna stand me up. l can feel it.

414
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,452
l can feel it in my bones.
l'm gonna be devastated.

415
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:13,871
No, no... l was just...

416
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:19,335
What? You were sitting around
watching TV in your sweatpants?

417
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:21,045
No, l'm not watching TV.

418
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:24,715
l am just getting dressed
and l'm gonna meet you at the place at...

419
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,677
-What time again?
-8:00.

420
00:31:28,971 --> 00:31:31,472
Right. 8:1 5. Okay.

421
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:35,351
-Remind me.
-Ern Brockovich.

422
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,228
Car accident. Not her fault, she says.

423
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:39,313
Hey, l'm going out.

424
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:42,775
l can see that.

425
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:45,653
Well, you are a trained investigator.

426
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:51,075
-Who are you going with?
-A boy from school.

427
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:53,411
Okay.

428
00:31:56,206 --> 00:32:00,626
-l wasn't asking for permission.
-l know. Just have a good time.

429
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,171
You want cab fare?

430
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:18,853
Should l wait up?

431
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:36,329
What desserts do you have?

432
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:44,337
Mango ice cream with nuts and raisins.

433
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:47,923
Great. l'll have that
and a glass of skim milk.

434
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:51,886
And then the lamb vindaloo. Thanks.

435
00:32:55,057 --> 00:32:59,268
Can l have a chicken tikka masala
and a Kingfisher, please?

436
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:04,899
l have my dessert first.

437
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:05,983
Oh!

438
00:33:06,068 --> 00:33:08,319
ls that a political statement?

439
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:12,073
Or a medical condition, perhaps?

440
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:18,079
l just don't see the point in waiting.
What if l die eating my vindaloo?

441
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:24,669
-ls that probable?
-lt's possible.

442
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:27,963
Embolism bursts,
asteroid hits the restaurant.

443
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:32,009
l'd die without having eaten
the one thing l wanted most.

444
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:38,140
-l mean, the odds are...
-Tell you what. Guarantee me,

445
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:43,771
swear to me on your eternal soul
that l make it through my entrée,

446
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:45,773
and l'll wait.

447
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:50,653
Before you answer, if l die,

448
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:53,364
you're gonna have to live
the rest of your life knowing

449
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:55,116
not only did you lie to me,

450
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:59,495
but you denied me
of my one last indulgence.

451
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,622
My last wish.

452
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:06,043
Are you prepared to shoulder
that kind of responsibility to prove a point?

453
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,799
Don't worry. l'll share.

454
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,222
l had a nice time.

455
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,350
Yeah?

456
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:26,981
You had a nice time,
or you're having a nice time?

457
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,652
'Cause if you're having a nice time,
why rush to end it?

458
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,991
Take a shot. Three for one. $1 .

459
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:39,618
Okay, come on. Win a prize.
Win a prize for the pretty lady.

460
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:42,246
Yeah. l want the panda.

461
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,289
TYLER: How many do you need to get
for the panda?

462
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:44,373
Three for three.

463
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:49,003
-Let's go.
-l knew that.

464
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:52,798
Almost.

465
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,344
Yeah. Give me three more.

466
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,346
lf l give up,

467
00:35:00,974 --> 00:35:02,266
he wins.

468
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:07,438
-Who? The attendant?
-The giant freaking panda.

469
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,274
Take it easy, tough guy.

470
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,568
l'm sorry. All right, three more. Three more.
Let's do it.

471
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:13,903
That's another $1 .

472
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:17,072
Yeah, l don't know
what you're smiling about.

473
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:19,700
l won.

474
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:22,953
Paying off the attendant is not winning.
lt's cheating.

475
00:35:25,207 --> 00:35:29,376
By the way, when were you gonna tell me
what the hell happened to your face?

476
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,591
l just got into a bar fight.

477
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:38,844
Do you want to go for a beer or something?

478
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:43,098
No, wait, you can't. You're too young.

479
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:45,392
l'm 21 .

480
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:47,895
No, you're not. You're...

481
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:50,314
Did you lie?

482
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:53,567
-l was trying to get rid of you.
-Oh.

483
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,950
That hurts. l'm wounded.

484
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:07,581
Well, it's getting pretty late, so...

485
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:10,167
l'll walk you to the subway.

486
00:36:10,252 --> 00:36:13,963
l'll take a cab.
l never take the subway anyway.

487
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:18,425
Okay.

488
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:28,185
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

489
00:36:33,275 --> 00:36:34,483
So...

490
00:36:37,571 --> 00:36:38,654
Uh...

491
00:36:41,575 --> 00:36:43,033
-Not tonight.
-Okay.

492
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:45,703
Not never, just not tonight.

493
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:48,330
-Are we going or what?
-Turn on the meter.

494
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,583
"Not never"?

495
00:36:51,293 --> 00:36:55,421
So dessert first, for fear of asteroid, yes,

496
00:36:57,132 --> 00:37:01,969
but kissing a guy
you seem to be attracted to, at least,

497
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:06,473
before driving off
into the unknown New York City night

498
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:10,811
alongside a panda you only just met, no?

499
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:12,688
Great.

500
00:37:20,614 --> 00:37:21,655
Good.

501
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,825
-You're really weird.
-Yeah, l know.

502
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,828
l'm going to Queens.
Don't wanna hear about it.

503
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:33,292
HeIIo, this is Jackie Mason. BuckIe up...

504
00:37:45,305 --> 00:37:48,307
-Happy end of 6th grade!
-Finally.

505
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:59,318
l got into that art program summer thing
at Steinhardt.

506
00:38:00,362 --> 00:38:01,654
Yeah, l heard.

507
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:05,783
lt's very prestigious,
due to my artistic greatness.

508
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:07,034
Mmm...

509
00:38:07,911 --> 00:38:12,039
Don't pretend you're not proud.
You should be.

510
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:19,421
-There's, like, a thing.
-A thing?

511
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:23,717
A show where you show
what you've done and stuff.

512
00:38:25,345 --> 00:38:26,720
Will you come?

513
00:38:28,098 --> 00:38:29,223
Um...

514
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,934
l'll have to check my book.

515
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:37,064
Abso-freaking-lutely. What, are you insane?

516
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,858
l'm gonna be there the day before.
l'm gonna camp out.

517
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:47,741
Your school's over, right?

518
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,786
Mom and Les are gonna get
the beach house again?

519
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,538
Yeah.

520
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:56,750
-What are we gonna do for your birthday?
-Nothing.

521
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,420
-Can we have a party?
-No.

522
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:02,381
A little one. At Mom's, with Aidan.

523
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:06,844
-l'll make Mom behave. No crying.
-Like that's even possible.

524
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:20,774
l know. We live like pigs.

525
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:22,776
But

526
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:27,781
l do have a coaster, if you want a coaster.

527
00:39:28,408 --> 00:39:30,409
Don't do coasters till the third date.

528
00:39:39,753 --> 00:39:41,170
Hey, who's that?

529
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:44,173
That's Michael. That's my brother.

530
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:47,509
He kind of looks like you.

531
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:50,971
-Does he play around here?
-Not anymore.

532
00:39:54,184 --> 00:39:56,185
Do you play?

533
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,355
Well, it depends who you ask.

534
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:04,318
lt turns out that you need talent.

535
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:09,823
So, what talents
do you actually possess, Tyler?

536
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:14,828
Not a lot. l, uh...

537
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:21,251
l used to do a bit of falconry
when l was a kid.

538
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:25,339
l mean, l come from a long line
of lrish falconers.

539
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:27,132
No, there is...

540
00:40:27,217 --> 00:40:28,258
Oh!

541
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:31,011
l don't know if this qualifies
as a talent, but...

542
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,139
-What is that?
-This

543
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:36,809
is our appetizer.

544
00:40:39,354 --> 00:40:42,022
l mean, it used to say, "ln case ofAsteroid,"

545
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:45,943
but Aidan, my roommate, got high,
and l was in the shower.

546
00:40:47,821 --> 00:40:48,821
So...

547
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:02,000
What kind of grade
did you get from Vogelstein?

548
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:04,920
l don't really get grades.

549
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:09,341
l'm not technically enrolled.
l just worked out this auditing thing.

550
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:10,509
Huh.

551
00:41:10,927 --> 00:41:14,388
So the Strand isn't a significant
career choice, either?

552
00:41:14,556 --> 00:41:16,682
No, l just like the books.

553
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:20,519
What are you doing?

554
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,856
-You don't need to help me.
-Yeah, well, at the rate you're going,

555
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:26,817
dishwashing's gonna be,
like, your life's vocation.

556
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:31,238
What?

557
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:34,825
Huh.

558
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:38,912
So, this is the whole playful
"you get me all wet" part, right?

559
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:43,542
-Why make it sound cheap?
-lt is cheap. l've seen this scene 1 00 times.

560
00:41:44,586 --> 00:41:46,920
You know what never happens
in this scene, though,

561
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:48,964
Tyler-who-doesn't-really-go-to-school?

562
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:51,133
Tyler-who-doesn't-really-
care-about-his-job?

563
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:53,969
-What?
-Nope?

564
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,017
That.

565
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:09,651
You better apologize!

566
00:42:09,736 --> 00:42:11,778
-Never!
-Apologize!

567
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:16,241
Your middle name is Keats?
God, your parents are pretentious as hell.

568
00:42:16,326 --> 00:42:18,827
-You better apologize.
-Never!

569
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:22,456
-Apologize!
-l'd rather eat monkeys!

570
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:25,459
Oh, God. Not in the plans! Not in the plans!

571
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:43,477
l surrender. l surrender. Jeez.

572
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:45,979
You're relentless.

573
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:53,862
-Victory at all costs.
-Oh, man...

574
00:42:55,657 --> 00:42:57,407
Now l'm pissed.

575
00:42:59,452 --> 00:43:01,328
You should quit anyway.

576
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:06,625
Why is that?
Are cigarettes bad for you or something?

577
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:13,465
Do you want a sweatshirt or something?

578
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:16,176
l'm okay. Thanks.

579
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:24,351
You know, the only time l ever smoked
was at the roller disco at the Y.

580
00:43:24,978 --> 00:43:28,021
l choked so bad,
Mr. Demmick gave me the Heimlich.

581
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:31,775
On skates?
That's actually quite impressive.

582
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:33,694
l never really thought of it that way.

583
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:40,492
Tattoo, huh? Let me see. What is it,
like a Chinese character or something?

584
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:42,286
'Cause l know this guy
who got a Chinese character,

585
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:43,829
and he thought it said...

586
00:43:47,709 --> 00:43:50,877
Sorry. l didn't know.

587
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:01,763
He killed himself.

588
00:44:08,021 --> 00:44:09,104
When?

589
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,693
On his 22nd birthday.

590
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:19,406
He'd just started working for my father.

591
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:23,744
l thought he was a musician.

592
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:27,414
Yeah, he was.

593
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:34,963
But he wasn't making any money. And

594
00:44:37,425 --> 00:44:39,843
my dad's a pretty compelling guy.

595
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:44,806
Yeah. So is mine.

596
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:52,064
-Damn, you're not naked!
-You're not lrish.

597
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:54,983
What the hell happened in the kitchen?

598
00:44:55,068 --> 00:44:58,570
lt looks like somebody's water broke
in there. lt's gross.

599
00:44:59,906 --> 00:45:02,783
-Hi.
-Hi.

600
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:05,035
Aidan, this is Ally.

601
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:08,997
-Ally, Ally...
-Ally, Aidan. This is my roommate.

602
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:12,334
Nice to meet you.

603
00:45:14,087 --> 00:45:16,213
-l work out.
-You're the assoholic.

604
00:45:16,297 --> 00:45:17,964
Yeah. Well, l...

605
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:19,257
Wait. What?

606
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:23,970
Okay, "Around The World" party, third floor.
Come on, let's go.

607
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:27,265
There's a whole lot of ugly,
but there's a lot more alcohol, so...

608
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:29,184
Come on, let's go.

609
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:31,019
Yeah, l would, l'd love to,
but l should get home.

610
00:45:31,104 --> 00:45:34,648
What? No, no, no.
All right, listen, listen, listen.

611
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,316
Ally? Ally, Ally?

612
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,360
One drink.

613
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:42,114
Any country you want.
l'll even put France on the table.

614
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:45,158
Come on. And then we'll go.

615
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:47,119
One drink?

616
00:45:50,206 --> 00:45:53,291
-One drink?
-One drink.

617
00:46:01,676 --> 00:46:03,093
How are we doing?

618
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:05,679
What?

619
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:09,683
What? What do you want me to say?
You want me to say l'm sorry?

620
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:13,645
You want me to apologize
for showing a nice girl a good time?

621
00:46:17,984 --> 00:46:20,360
-l'm sorry.
-Tyler,

622
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:25,198
l need you to call my dad.

623
00:46:29,996 --> 00:46:33,123
Yeah, sure. Where's your phone?

624
00:46:39,881 --> 00:46:41,840
Ally, your phone's dead.

625
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:45,969
Ally?

626
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:48,430
What's his number?

627
00:46:51,893 --> 00:46:53,393
God damn.

628
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:59,316
Do you think l give a shit how late it is?

629
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:04,237
l know she's a smart girl, Leo.
She's supposed to be back. She's not back.

630
00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:09,409
Leo, don't go there. All right?

631
00:47:10,286 --> 00:47:13,747
l want... l want you to call Ted Proferes!

632
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,084
Yeah. And call me back.

633
00:47:19,921 --> 00:47:21,546
God damn it, just do it!

634
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:06,967
Oh, shit.

635
00:48:07,176 --> 00:48:08,176
Shit!

636
00:48:42,503 --> 00:48:44,671
l'm sorry. l fell asleep.

637
00:48:47,008 --> 00:48:48,842
Asleep where?

638
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:51,886
My phone died, so...

639
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:57,976
-That's mine. That's from my desk.
-l was trying to find some information.

640
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:00,270
What am l now, one of your suspects?

641
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:03,064
When you act like one.
Are you on anything?

642
00:49:03,149 --> 00:49:06,151
-Oh, for God's sake.
-Don't use that tone with me, Ally.

643
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:09,029
l smell alcohol.

644
00:49:09,739 --> 00:49:11,239
Yeah, so do l.

645
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:16,578
What's going on here, Ally? Are you trying
to tell me something with this?

646
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:18,371
You're all grown up now?

647
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:22,709
Yeah, maybe it's time you get used to it,
Dad, before you give yourself a heart attack.

648
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:24,294
Who's the guy?

649
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:27,881
-God, what makes you think there's a guy?
-Yeah, he's a real prince.

650
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:31,384
He gets you drunk,
sends you home smelling like a brewery,

651
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:33,595
smelling like God knows what.

652
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:38,558
-You sure can pick them.
-Yeah, l take after my mother.

653
00:49:43,439 --> 00:49:47,400
-l'm not a child, okay?
-Hey! ln this house, you are!

654
00:49:48,194 --> 00:49:49,402
You'd love that!

655
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:52,030
You're pathetic! Would you strangle me
'cause you couldn't save Mom...

656
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:57,911
Ally? Ally?

657
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:02,082
Don't touch me! Don't...

658
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:19,474
So, what? She just left? No goodbye?

659
00:50:21,394 --> 00:50:23,770
You were the one dumping
Jell-O shots down her throat.

660
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:27,440
Hey, there are sins of omission
and sins of commission.

661
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:31,111
l've forgiven myself, okay?
You should do the same.

662
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:33,446
All right, here we go.

663
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:36,116
Come on! Come on!

664
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:40,120
Here we go! Here we go!

665
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:45,500
Got it! Okay!

666
00:50:46,127 --> 00:50:47,877
Okay... Don't think l can...

667
00:50:47,962 --> 00:50:48,962
Crushing!

668
00:50:49,088 --> 00:50:52,924
lt's crushing! l need a little help here! Tyler!

669
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:56,761
-What the hell, man?
-lt's penance.

670
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:58,805
l'm going to work.

671
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:01,599
Help!

672
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:03,935
Well, if you had another one
of those protein shakes...

673
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:07,313
Yeah, but it was freaking
crushing my sternum, you jackass.

674
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:14,279
Hey.

675
00:51:21,162 --> 00:51:22,662
How's she doing?

676
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:27,333
She's pretty shaken up.

677
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:33,339
We need to fix that deadbolt.

678
00:51:34,258 --> 00:51:36,676
Yeah. That's my bad.

679
00:51:36,886 --> 00:51:40,013
Don't worry about it.
Do you think she's gonna sleep?

680
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:48,271
You know, you realize
if she'd had the S.L.U.T...

681
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:52,776
ls it too soon?

682
00:51:59,992 --> 00:52:03,077
l told her she can stay here.
ls that all right?

683
00:52:03,162 --> 00:52:07,999
-Yeah. As long as she needs.
-Thank you.

684
00:52:37,196 --> 00:52:38,571
You're up.

685
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:48,581
-Can l get you anything?
-No.

686
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,796
Aidan left.

687
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:06,266
So, yeah, l'll be in here
if you need something.

688
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:10,033
Thanks, honey. See you later.

689
00:56:15,414 --> 00:56:18,207
l can't believe you still come down here.

690
00:56:21,754 --> 00:56:24,380
l can't believe he still drinks that stuff.

691
00:56:24,465 --> 00:56:27,633
Well, you know how it goes.
You can take the kid out of Brooklyn...

692
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:31,763
You're not writing anything bad about me,
are you?

693
00:56:31,972 --> 00:56:33,389
Not today.

694
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:37,143
l gotta run. Early meetings.

695
00:56:39,271 --> 00:56:41,397
ln case l don't see you before Saturday,

696
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,483
happy birthday.

697
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:47,862
l'll tell your father you said hello.

698
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:50,156
Bye, doll.

699
00:56:54,161 --> 00:56:55,495
Bialy.

700
00:56:57,581 --> 00:56:58,915
Thank you.

701
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:04,212
-Hey.
-Hey.

702
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:10,259
-Where you been?
-Downtown, near Wall Street.

703
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:14,430
-Why?
-l went to a coffee shop.

704
00:57:16,016 --> 00:57:17,683
l got you a bialy.

705
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:22,480
Thanks. Yeah.

706
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:26,192
You realize New York's
full of coffee shops?

707
00:57:27,653 --> 00:57:30,196
Yeah, it was me and Michael's place.

708
00:57:31,532 --> 00:57:34,617
We used to go there for breakfast
all the time.

709
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:38,704
l mean, probably not as many times
as l think we did,

710
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:42,667
but enough.

711
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:48,339
We went there on the morning that...

712
00:57:50,217 --> 00:57:52,593
lt was the last place l saw him.

713
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:55,555
You go there to write to him?

714
00:57:58,517 --> 00:58:01,227
l just wanted to tell someone about you.

715
00:58:10,237 --> 00:58:12,697
My mom was murdered 1 0 years ago.

716
00:58:13,824 --> 00:58:17,243
You don't have to say anything.
You're sorry. l know.

717
00:58:18,871 --> 00:58:21,497
And my dad...

718
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:26,878
My dad's the kind of guy
who needs to take care of people.

719
00:58:26,962 --> 00:58:29,714
l know that sounds kind of weird right now,

720
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:33,259
but he's not that guy.

721
00:58:34,261 --> 00:58:37,597
You know, l trust him. l really do.

722
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:41,017
And l just don't want you to think
that l'm here

723
00:58:41,101 --> 00:58:44,061
'cause he's some crazy, belligerent person.

724
00:58:45,981 --> 00:58:50,610
He just doesn't understand, or...

725
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:57,241
l don't know, just doesn't know
what's going on right now.

726
00:59:03,832 --> 00:59:05,917
What's going on right now?

727
00:59:11,215 --> 00:59:12,715
l don't know.

728
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:26,187
-Did you call dispatch to check?
-l...

729
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:28,397
You're gonna have to testify to this!

730
00:59:28,482 --> 00:59:30,233
And they're gonna ask you,
"Are you sure of the time?"

731
00:59:30,317 --> 00:59:32,068
And you're gonna say what?

732
00:59:32,152 --> 00:59:34,487
-8:1 5?
-Come on, you...

733
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:37,823
-Neil.
-What?

734
00:59:42,871 --> 00:59:44,247
Hey,

735
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:47,291
-Ally called Sharon.
-What?

736
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:50,586
She said to tell you that she's with friends
and she's doing fine.

737
00:59:50,671 --> 00:59:52,505
-Which friends?
-She didn't say.

738
00:59:53,924 --> 00:59:55,132
That's all?

739
00:59:58,178 --> 01:00:00,179
Yeah. l'm sorry, buddy.

740
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:03,432
Look, why don't you come out
for the weekend?

741
01:00:03,517 --> 01:00:06,477
We'll get the grill going.
Sharon wants to see you,

742
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:08,271
-and we'll call some nice people up...
-No.

743
01:00:08,355 --> 01:00:12,024
-Come out to Patchogue, Neil...
-No, Leo. Stop!

744
01:00:21,368 --> 01:00:22,743
Make a wish!

745
01:00:31,712 --> 01:00:33,754
-Come on...
-All right!

746
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:35,631
-Yeah!
-Big two-two!

747
01:00:35,716 --> 01:00:38,009
-Big 22!
-Yeah!

748
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:43,556
-Wait... Right, two, three...
-Think one, two, three...

749
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,099
Look at her.

750
01:00:45,809 --> 01:00:49,895
-One, two, three...
-Tyler? l'm worried.

751
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:55,943
l'm concerned her father
isn't gonna come to her show.

752
01:00:56,028 --> 01:00:58,404
Well, yeah. l'd be worried, too.

753
01:00:59,865 --> 01:01:02,325
l was hoping for some reassurance.

754
01:01:02,868 --> 01:01:06,370
-One, two, three...
-Spin. Got that.

755
01:01:06,455 --> 01:01:08,622
-She's gonna be heartbroken.
-Listen...

756
01:01:12,419 --> 01:01:14,754
l'll get him there.

757
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:21,218
-You will? Really?
-Yeah, Mom. l'll get him there.

758
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:27,433
-Thanks.
-Aidan. Aidan, get your...

759
01:01:28,018 --> 01:01:30,186
-One, two, three. One...
-Two, three...

760
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:32,688
Get your filthy hands off my sister.

761
01:01:32,773 --> 01:01:34,106
Thank God.

762
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:36,442
-Madame.
-Tyler.

763
01:01:36,985 --> 01:01:41,614
So, you're actually the second member
of the family that l've washed dishes with.

764
01:01:42,574 --> 01:01:43,741
Tyler?

765
01:01:45,285 --> 01:01:49,872
He's never washed a dish in his life.
He must have tried to impress you.

766
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:50,956
Ah...

767
01:01:53,585 --> 01:01:56,212
-He says you're in social work.
-Mmm-hmm.

768
01:01:56,296 --> 01:01:57,463
Did you go to school for that?

769
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:07,139
They're afraid to move at all.
They're certainly not gonna come down.

770
01:02:07,224 --> 01:02:08,724
That's why
they're gonna come down.

771
01:02:08,809 --> 01:02:11,018
Charles, it's your son.

772
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:14,480
-What?
-He's on the phone.

773
01:02:22,114 --> 01:02:23,739
Tyler, you're on speakerphone.

774
01:02:24,825 --> 01:02:28,494
-Yeah, l'm calling about Caroline's art show.
-What about it?

775
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:31,539
Hold on.

776
01:02:37,504 --> 01:02:38,546
No.

777
01:02:39,381 --> 01:02:40,840
Yes. TyIer?

778
01:02:41,633 --> 01:02:44,385
Yeah, l was wondering
if you wanted to have dinner beforehand.

779
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:45,553
What?

780
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:48,389
Do you want to have dinner before?

781
01:02:48,849 --> 01:02:50,850
Yeah. Yeah, that would be fine.

782
01:02:51,685 --> 01:02:55,104
l'll have Janine make a reservation
somewhere nice, like the...

783
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:56,188
l don't know, the Oak Room.

784
01:02:56,731 --> 01:02:59,024
No, that's not what l mean.

785
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:00,359
How many?

786
01:03:03,155 --> 01:03:04,738
TyIer, how many?

787
01:03:07,868 --> 01:03:09,034
Three.

788
01:03:09,661 --> 01:03:11,829
AII right. Three it is.

789
01:03:13,832 --> 01:03:15,791
lt's 22 today, isn't it?

790
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:18,419
Yeah.

791
01:03:22,549 --> 01:03:24,049
Happy birthday.

792
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:26,802
Yeah, thanks.

793
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:38,814
Enter.

794
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:41,192
We're gonna go.

795
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:43,736
Thanks for the party, Maestro.

796
01:03:44,571 --> 01:03:45,946
Did it suck?

797
01:03:47,908 --> 01:03:49,033
Ha, ha!

798
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:52,077
-Hey.
-Hey.

799
01:03:53,914 --> 01:03:56,707
-l'll go and get us a cab.
-Okay.

800
01:04:08,762 --> 01:04:09,803
Wow!

801
01:04:17,604 --> 01:04:19,396
Can l see?

802
01:04:23,443 --> 01:04:25,277
That's exactly him.

803
01:04:26,613 --> 01:04:30,032
lt's like the cigarette's the last Coke
in the desert.

804
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:39,124
-l can't believe he smokes in front of you.
-Don't worry, l'm not that impressionable.

805
01:04:42,671 --> 01:04:46,549
You know, when l was younger, we didn't
have air conditioning in the house,

806
01:04:47,175 --> 01:04:51,303
so during the summer, my mom and l
would go to museums to cool off.

807
01:04:51,388 --> 01:04:54,640
She loved them all,
but the Met was her favorite.

808
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:58,602
Yeah. The Met's one of my favorite places

809
01:04:58,687 --> 01:05:00,229
-in the world.
-Yeah?

810
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:03,148
So, you've got an art exhibit coming up?

811
01:05:05,068 --> 01:05:06,151
Yeah.

812
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:09,321
You mind if l come?

813
01:05:11,366 --> 01:05:15,202
l mean, l understand
if you don't want some random girl there.

814
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:19,915
You're not random.
You're Tyler's girlfriend.

815
01:05:27,549 --> 01:05:29,008
And while we must devote

816
01:05:29,092 --> 01:05:30,593
enormous energy to conquering disease,

817
01:05:30,677 --> 01:05:34,054
it is equaIIy important
that we pay attention to the moraI concerns

818
01:05:34,139 --> 01:05:38,434
raised by the new frontier
of human embryo stem ceII research.

819
01:05:38,518 --> 01:05:41,979
Even the most noble ends
do not justify any means.

820
01:05:42,063 --> 01:05:45,691
Embryonic stem ceII research offers both
great promise and great periI...

821
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:53,616
Have you ever been
to the Oak Room before?

822
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:57,870
Oh, yeah. l come here all the time
with my dad and his bowling buddies.

823
01:06:00,707 --> 01:06:03,709
He can stand me up,
but he can't stand you up.

824
01:06:05,754 --> 01:06:08,088
And he can't stand my sister up.

825
01:06:11,468 --> 01:06:14,637
-Can l get another whiskey, please?
-Give me the same, Sean.

826
01:06:14,721 --> 01:06:16,847
-Laphroaig. Neat.
-Yes.

827
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:20,309
-And for the lady?
-l'm still good. Thanks.

828
01:06:32,947 --> 01:06:37,868
Alyssa Craig, this is my father,
Charles Hawkins. Ally.

829
01:06:37,952 --> 01:06:40,913
-lt's a pleasure.
-Pleasure.

830
01:06:47,921 --> 01:06:50,756
So, you're going to be a social worker?

831
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:55,135
Yeah. But with a focused area
of responsibility.

832
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:59,515
-Makes it easier to get a job.
-l see. What area is that going to be?

833
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:02,851
-Criminal justice.
-That's a...

834
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:05,771
That's a tough area.

835
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:10,442
When l was a kid,
l wanted to play shortstop for the Mets.

836
01:07:10,527 --> 01:07:12,319
l don't think it's any harder than that.

837
01:07:12,404 --> 01:07:13,654
The Mets!

838
01:07:15,532 --> 01:07:17,199
l'm from Queens.

839
01:07:17,742 --> 01:07:21,870
My father's a Yankees fan.
lt has something to do with the payroll.

840
01:07:22,497 --> 01:07:25,249
lt has something to do
with significant ball-playing.

841
01:07:25,333 --> 01:07:26,500
Right.

842
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:29,545
You were a Yankees fan
when you were little.

843
01:07:29,629 --> 01:07:32,131
You were Lou Piniella for Halloween.

844
01:07:34,843 --> 01:07:37,136
Just blind familial allegiance.

845
01:07:38,138 --> 01:07:43,308
That's before l knew what overpaid, overfed,
fat bastards they were.

846
01:07:45,645 --> 01:07:49,148
Who's fat? What Yankee is fat? Tell me.

847
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:52,151
lt's a metaphor.

848
01:07:56,948 --> 01:07:58,449
Roger Clemens.

849
01:08:05,915 --> 01:08:07,249
Luis Sojo.

850
01:08:10,545 --> 01:08:12,045
Shane Spencer.

851
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:13,922
He's big-boned.

852
01:08:28,855 --> 01:08:30,230
Dessert now?

853
01:08:31,566 --> 01:08:35,277
-Does this still count as your entrée?
-People can change.

854
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:37,738
So how long has your dad been a cop?

855
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:40,365
Twenty-two years.

856
01:08:42,535 --> 01:08:43,660
Would you excuse me?

857
01:08:45,288 --> 01:08:46,747
l'm so sorry.

858
01:08:50,710 --> 01:08:54,046
Hey. lt's just a phone call.
At least he waited till dessert.

859
01:08:54,672 --> 01:08:58,133
You're killing me.
Look, you're killing me right now. Okay?

860
01:09:03,348 --> 01:09:08,310
-l'm so sorry. And your mother?
-She passed away when l was 1 1 .

861
01:09:11,648 --> 01:09:14,983
She was murdered, and l was there.

862
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:21,615
l never mentioned that part.

863
01:09:26,538 --> 01:09:28,664
Why are you saying this now?

864
01:09:30,124 --> 01:09:31,583
l don't know.

865
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:35,921
And here you are.

866
01:09:38,591 --> 01:09:39,925
Here l am.

867
01:09:46,933 --> 01:09:48,642
He's not so bad.

868
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:50,352
Oh, God.

869
01:09:54,065 --> 01:09:55,524
No, don't say it.

870
01:09:56,067 --> 01:09:58,277
l've got to go to the office.

871
01:10:00,446 --> 01:10:02,948
-Listen, the exhibit runs till 9:00.
-No, you have somewhere else to be.

872
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:06,493
-You guys take my car, and l'll...
-l don't believe you!

873
01:10:07,287 --> 01:10:10,497
-That's all there is, Tyler.
-That's all there is?

874
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:12,916
That's all there is?

875
01:10:13,001 --> 01:10:15,544
Take the car. l'll get a cab,
and l'll meet you there.

876
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:20,132
lt's not enough.

877
01:10:24,304 --> 01:10:25,846
Do l actually look like that?

878
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:28,390
Oh, no.
lt was probably just the lighting.

879
01:10:29,475 --> 01:10:32,311
l brought you every single flavor.

880
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:36,648
l'm ready to go home now.

881
01:10:40,111 --> 01:10:41,361
Ally.

882
01:10:49,412 --> 01:10:52,164
God, Tyler? Can we at least talk about this?

883
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:55,292
Where are you going to go right now?
And what are you gonna do

884
01:10:55,376 --> 01:10:58,670
that's actually gonna help anything?
Do you really think...

885
01:10:59,672 --> 01:11:01,882
You better look after yourself for an hour.

886
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:04,968
Are you capable of doing that?

887
01:11:23,446 --> 01:11:27,616
Are you guys telling me you get the call
at 6:00, and l don't get it till 8:00 tonight?

888
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:30,535
Now, l don't know what's going on,
but someone's dropped the ball here...

889
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:32,746
-Tyler!
-Mr. Hawkins!

890
01:11:33,081 --> 01:11:34,665
lt's fine, Janine. lt's fine.

891
01:11:34,749 --> 01:11:38,043
She drew you a picture. She drew you
a picture, and you didn't come.

892
01:11:41,047 --> 01:11:42,798
Put it on the table.

893
01:11:43,925 --> 01:11:49,596
You have a daughter who sincerely believes
that you don't like her.

894
01:11:51,391 --> 01:11:54,726
l mean, she's trying to communicate.
She's speaking.

895
01:11:55,019 --> 01:11:59,773
But why aren't you listening?
l mean, why aren't you

896
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:02,401
riveted?

897
01:12:03,111 --> 01:12:07,447
Why is this not the most important thing,
just for one night?

898
01:12:08,408 --> 01:12:09,408
Tyler.

899
01:12:09,534 --> 01:12:13,036
-We can come back.
-No, it's fine. Sit down. Sit down. lt's okay.

900
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:20,460
Who's this display for?

901
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:23,839
lt's for you.

902
01:12:25,758 --> 01:12:28,176
She knows l'll take care of her.

903
01:12:28,261 --> 01:12:29,344
And?

904
01:12:30,138 --> 01:12:34,057
-We really can come back another...
-Sit the fuck down! Now!

905
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:39,980
And that l love her. l love her.

906
01:12:41,858 --> 01:12:46,528
Good God, you toss that word around,
but you have no idea what it means!

907
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:48,113
Maybe l don't.

908
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:52,951
-And maybe Caroline doesn't, either.
-l have provided her world, and yours.

909
01:12:53,036 --> 01:12:56,413
That doesn't mean you can just shatter it
whenever you feel,

910
01:12:56,497 --> 01:12:58,540
whenever there's something better to do!

911
01:12:58,624 --> 01:13:00,042
Who the hell do you think
you're talking to?

912
01:13:00,126 --> 01:13:02,419
You pedaled down here on your bike,
for Christ's sake!

913
01:13:02,503 --> 01:13:07,257
You gotta take care of nothing!
You're responsible for no one! You're a kid!

914
01:13:07,341 --> 01:13:10,302
You think you're the first one
to lose anything?

915
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:15,557
You think that whatever you feel
in your heart, l don't also feel it in mine?

916
01:13:19,353 --> 01:13:21,146
You didn't find him.

917
01:13:21,606 --> 01:13:23,231
See, l found him.

918
01:13:25,318 --> 01:13:29,362
And you're so just tragically blind

919
01:13:30,531 --> 01:13:34,826
that the rest of your children
are gonna hang themselves on your watch.

920
01:13:34,911 --> 01:13:37,454
You little piece of... Come over here,
l'm gonna smack you.

921
01:13:37,538 --> 01:13:39,289
-What? What?
-No. No!

922
01:13:39,373 --> 01:13:42,167
Tyler! Get out of here! Get out of here!

923
01:13:48,007 --> 01:13:50,675
God, there's no frigging air in here!

924
01:13:58,976 --> 01:13:59,976
Hey!

925
01:14:02,605 --> 01:14:07,526
Hey.

926
01:14:07,902 --> 01:14:09,069
Hey. Hey.

927
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:12,989
Come here. lt's okay.
lt's okay, baby. Come here.

928
01:14:13,074 --> 01:14:17,160
lt's okay, baby. Baby, it's okay.
lt's okay. lt's okay.

929
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:19,329
lt's okay. Okay?

930
01:14:23,251 --> 01:14:24,251
lt's okay.

931
01:15:07,128 --> 01:15:09,421
Dad, it's me.

932
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:14,384
I just wanted to Iet you know
I'm okay, and...

933
01:15:15,386 --> 01:15:17,596
I'm going away for Labor Day.

934
01:15:19,098 --> 01:15:23,602
Yeah, weII, I hope you're good,
and I'II taIk to you sometime.

935
01:15:23,936 --> 01:15:25,562
Okay. Bye.

936
01:15:30,818 --> 01:15:33,195
Dad, it's me.

937
01:15:34,697 --> 01:15:38,450
I just wanted to Iet you know
I'm okay, and...

938
01:15:39,202 --> 01:15:41,077
I'm going away for Labor Day.

939
01:15:58,512 --> 01:16:00,055
Second word.

940
01:16:02,767 --> 01:16:04,893
-Long-armed?
-Trunk?

941
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:06,311
Breathing?

942
01:16:07,355 --> 01:16:09,189
-Referee?
-Direction?

943
01:16:10,775 --> 01:16:12,567
-The wall... The wall.
-High?

944
01:16:12,652 --> 01:16:15,487
You're climbing over the wall.
Over the hill...

945
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:33,171
l want a girlfriend.

946
01:16:34,757 --> 01:16:38,134
-What?
-Dinners out. Movies.

947
01:16:39,178 --> 01:16:40,470
Regular sex.

948
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:45,517
l could handle that for, like, a summer.

949
01:16:46,143 --> 01:16:49,104
-You're such a romantic.
-Yeah, damn right.

950
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:52,232
l've been romantic with all the races.

951
01:16:52,858 --> 01:16:56,903
-Excuse me?
-l have planted my flag in every continent.

952
01:16:59,282 --> 01:17:03,034
-So, white girl.
-Please. lt's like falling off a log.

953
01:17:04,578 --> 01:17:05,620
Asian.

954
01:17:08,249 --> 01:17:09,374
Um...

955
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:12,460
-Eskimo.
-Next stop, Patchogue.

956
01:17:12,545 --> 01:17:15,213
-No!
-Monica lmpellie.

957
01:17:16,048 --> 01:17:18,425
She works at the public library
on 96th Street.

958
01:17:18,509 --> 01:17:21,636
-You slept with an Eskimo?
-You went to the library?

959
01:17:23,139 --> 01:17:25,348
-l don't believe you.
-Fine.

960
01:17:25,725 --> 01:17:27,642
-She's a nice girl.
-Prove it. 10 bucks.

961
01:17:27,727 --> 01:17:29,936
-You wanna go to the library?
-The second we get off this train.

962
01:17:30,021 --> 01:17:31,730
-Fine.
-Are you coming?

963
01:17:32,148 --> 01:17:34,733
No, l'm gonna skip
this particular bloodbath, thank you.

964
01:17:34,817 --> 01:17:36,484
Leo. You're off duty.

965
01:17:36,569 --> 01:17:38,361
Station stop is Patchogue.

966
01:18:53,437 --> 01:18:54,938
Where is she?

967
01:18:56,732 --> 01:19:00,902
-What are you doing in my house?
-Where is my daughter?

968
01:19:03,489 --> 01:19:05,323
She's at the library.

969
01:19:10,246 --> 01:19:11,746
Does she know?

970
01:19:16,001 --> 01:19:18,420
-No.
-No, l didn't think so.

971
01:19:19,713 --> 01:19:23,174
l figured you'd probably leave it up to me

972
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:26,302
when you're done with her.

973
01:19:27,888 --> 01:19:29,806
l'm not going anywhere.

974
01:19:30,808 --> 01:19:34,352
Boy, that's true. Tyler Hawkins.

975
01:19:36,188 --> 01:19:38,440
Son of Charles and Diane.

976
01:19:39,191 --> 01:19:42,652
Brother of Caroline and Michael, deceased.

977
01:19:44,029 --> 01:19:46,406
Suicide by hanging.

978
01:19:49,285 --> 01:19:51,536
You're kind of lost, aren't you?

979
01:19:51,829 --> 01:19:58,293
Take a little vacation in coach
before finding your way back to first class?

980
01:20:01,547 --> 01:20:03,506
You think you know me,

981
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:05,800
but you don't.

982
01:20:07,887 --> 01:20:09,554
But l do know you.

983
01:20:11,557 --> 01:20:13,141
l know you got nothing.

984
01:20:15,561 --> 01:20:19,022
l know you threw away the one person
that gave a shit.

985
01:20:20,149 --> 01:20:22,942
Now you wanna blame me. That's all right.

986
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:26,237
But you know what?

987
01:20:27,698 --> 01:20:30,867
l did the whole thing for a bet anyway.

988
01:21:19,124 --> 01:21:21,000
Get a fucking deadbolt!

989
01:21:55,202 --> 01:21:58,621
Tyler Keats Hawkins!
You are never gonna believe this!

990
01:21:59,164 --> 01:22:00,748
He banged an lnuit!

991
01:22:00,833 --> 01:22:05,587
And she's really nice and really smart,
and l really don't get it.

992
01:22:11,802 --> 01:22:14,012
What's wrong?

993
01:22:16,015 --> 01:22:17,682
Your dad was here.

994
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:20,018
Wait... What?

995
01:22:20,936 --> 01:22:24,564
-Your dad was here when l got home.
-Shit.

996
01:22:25,024 --> 01:22:27,442
Shit! Okay, what did he say?

997
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:32,739
l know him.

998
01:22:35,117 --> 01:22:38,328
He arrested me and Aidan before l met you.

999
01:22:39,538 --> 01:22:42,540
The gash on my eye?
That was him.

1000
01:22:45,461 --> 01:22:48,046
l don't really understand.

1001
01:22:48,130 --> 01:22:52,050
l mouthed off to him and he responded.

1002
01:22:54,803 --> 01:22:57,555
And then Aidan saw you guys at school,

1003
01:22:59,224 --> 01:23:01,476
so he suggested that

1004
01:23:02,436 --> 01:23:04,562
l introduce myself to you.

1005
01:23:13,572 --> 01:23:14,989
l feel sick.

1006
01:23:21,413 --> 01:23:33,925
Ally.

1007
01:23:35,844 --> 01:23:38,721
-What are you doing?
-What does it look like?

1008
01:23:41,225 --> 01:23:43,476
But you don't need to do that.

1009
01:23:44,687 --> 01:23:47,271
Do you even realize what you've done?

1010
01:23:51,276 --> 01:23:52,652
Ally.

1011
01:23:55,739 --> 01:23:58,658
l mean, did you really think
l would never find out?

1012
01:23:59,368 --> 01:24:02,745
l had to find out eventually.
You set it up that way.

1013
01:24:04,623 --> 01:24:07,959
Ally, it doesn't mean anything.
lt's not a big deal.

1014
01:24:08,711 --> 01:24:12,755
-l didn't mean to hurt you.
-That's exactly what you meant to do.

1015
01:24:25,519 --> 01:24:28,479
You had to tell her eventually, man.

1016
01:24:33,444 --> 01:24:34,986
She'll be back.

1017
01:25:19,698 --> 01:25:24,118
You're not supposed to use that
on nonstick pans.

1018
01:25:25,954 --> 01:25:27,914
lt takes off the Teflon.

1019
01:25:29,666 --> 01:25:31,542
You gotta let it soak.

1020
01:25:32,169 --> 01:25:33,252
Okay.

1021
01:25:35,589 --> 01:25:37,465
l'm gonna...

1022
01:25:46,809 --> 01:25:50,895
-l don't feel so good.
-Oh, come on. lt's supposed to be fun.

1023
01:25:53,148 --> 01:25:55,566
You know, maybe if you tried
to meet people halfway, you know,

1024
01:25:55,651 --> 01:25:57,902
put a little bit of effort in?

1025
01:25:58,987 --> 01:26:01,405
lf you tried to grow up a little?

1026
01:26:01,865 --> 01:26:03,074
Maybe...

1027
01:26:05,869 --> 01:26:07,203
Caroline.

1028
01:26:09,748 --> 01:26:11,958
Emily. Emily! Come on, the door.

1029
01:26:12,042 --> 01:26:13,334
-Happy birthday.
-Hi, sweetie.

1030
01:26:13,418 --> 01:26:15,711
-Can you hold on a second? Yeah.
-Thank you.

1031
01:26:15,796 --> 01:26:19,715
Thanks. Okay. Come on in, sweetie.
Come on in. The party's right in there.

1032
01:26:20,884 --> 01:26:25,137
Yeah. l know. l need ice. lce. Yeah.
Napkins would be good.

1033
01:26:26,682 --> 01:26:28,516
Oh, wait! Liz has gotta find her.

1034
01:26:29,101 --> 01:26:30,351
Yeah.

1035
01:26:45,951 --> 01:26:49,453
-I didn't do this for you.
-Thanks, dude.

1036
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:52,039
-Where's my big guy?
-Oh, my God!

1037
01:26:52,124 --> 01:26:53,374
Oh, no.

1038
01:26:57,838 --> 01:27:00,840
-Jim! l got here a little early.
-Get out!

1039
01:27:00,924 --> 01:27:03,926
-l'll wait in the car.
-Go, Dad! Oh, my...

1040
01:27:04,970 --> 01:27:07,638
-Who is that? ls that your dad?
-Yeah...

1041
01:27:08,849 --> 01:27:10,266
So, l'mjust..
l'm not embarrassed.

1042
01:27:10,350 --> 01:27:11,809
l am!

1043
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:19,859
Mom? l'm okay.

1044
01:27:20,694 --> 01:27:22,820
Don't panic. l'm gonna be fine.

1045
01:27:22,905 --> 01:27:25,531
-l just need you to come get me right away.
-You've gotta get over here.

1046
01:27:25,616 --> 01:27:27,742
Someone cut a chunk
out of this little girl's hair.

1047
01:27:27,826 --> 01:27:28,951
Come quickly.

1048
01:27:48,221 --> 01:27:50,765
Hi. ls...

1049
01:27:53,685 --> 01:27:56,062
Alyssa Craig, does she live here?

1050
01:27:56,813 --> 01:27:59,023
Okay. Great. That's... l'm...

1051
01:27:59,650 --> 01:28:01,943
You think l don't remember you?

1052
01:28:03,612 --> 01:28:05,529
-No, sir.
-Who is it?

1053
01:28:10,953 --> 01:28:12,286
lt's okay.

1054
01:28:19,336 --> 01:28:21,128
So, what do you want?

1055
01:28:24,383 --> 01:28:26,801
Look. l'm a prick. You know? And...

1056
01:28:26,885 --> 01:28:27,969
And?

1057
01:28:29,137 --> 01:28:30,221
Dad!

1058
01:28:31,473 --> 01:28:32,848
Look, Tyler's not.

1059
01:28:32,933 --> 01:28:34,892
-Look, l...
-Would you just wait?

1060
01:28:35,227 --> 01:28:37,144
Shit! All right, l'm not...

1061
01:28:37,229 --> 01:28:40,106
l'm not any good at this. All right?
lt's not my thing.

1062
01:28:40,732 --> 01:28:42,692
He lied to me. Big time.

1063
01:28:44,528 --> 01:28:46,404
He's in love with you.

1064
01:28:48,573 --> 01:28:51,784
l have only seen him look at one other girl
the way he looks at you.

1065
01:28:52,035 --> 01:28:54,912
And she's a lot shorter and shares his DNA.

1066
01:28:55,747 --> 01:28:58,249
You don't have to forgive him today.

1067
01:28:59,459 --> 01:29:01,085
Just forgive him.

1068
01:29:02,754 --> 01:29:03,921
Yeah. She's pretty traumatized.

1069
01:29:04,006 --> 01:29:06,549
-No! l'm trying.
-l wanted to pull some names together

1070
01:29:06,633 --> 01:29:08,175
in case we all decided
she should talk to someone.

1071
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:09,927
l just talked to her. No.

1072
01:29:10,012 --> 01:29:12,722
-Diane's pretty upset, too.
-That's what l'm trying to tell you.

1073
01:29:12,806 --> 01:29:15,474
No, the girls are saying
Caroline did it to herself.

1074
01:29:15,559 --> 01:29:17,560
-But it's not true!
-Yeah.

1075
01:29:18,770 --> 01:29:19,895
All of them.

1076
01:29:19,980 --> 01:29:22,106
"...he sang almost as beautifully."

1077
01:29:22,315 --> 01:29:25,192
lt didn't happen
on school property, so...

1078
01:29:25,777 --> 01:29:28,946
"When he was grown, he left his mother..."

1079
01:29:29,031 --> 01:29:31,532
The school's not gonna do anything.

1080
01:29:31,616 --> 01:29:34,618
Yeah, they're probably
gonna get away with it.

1081
01:29:35,287 --> 01:29:37,455
"...and his eight loving aunts,

1082
01:29:38,540 --> 01:29:41,042
"and he went to live
in his father's kingdom of Thrace

1083
01:29:41,126 --> 01:29:46,213
"to bring the joy of music to earth.
His voice rang so pure and true

1084
01:29:46,298 --> 01:29:49,633
"that the fiercest warriors
put down their swords

1085
01:29:49,718 --> 01:29:52,970
"and savage beasts
lay spellbound at his feet."

1086
01:29:53,638 --> 01:29:56,140
You give me the word
and l will steal their bikes.

1087
01:29:58,894 --> 01:29:59,977
Ally.

1088
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:07,151
lt's so sweet of you to come.

1089
01:30:27,005 --> 01:30:29,340
lt's my last one ever. l swear.

1090
01:30:39,643 --> 01:30:40,976
Look, l...

1091
01:30:41,686 --> 01:30:44,021
l know you're not here for me.

1092
01:30:46,942 --> 01:30:48,442
And l don't...

1093
01:30:52,864 --> 01:30:55,449
Just thank you for being here anyway.

1094
01:31:05,377 --> 01:31:08,462
And for what it's worth,
l think you're amazing.

1095
01:31:17,222 --> 01:31:19,181
How is she? Huh?

01:31:19,724 --> 01:31:21,225
She's asleep.

1097
01:31:54,342 --> 01:31:57,136
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

1098
01:31:57,220 --> 01:31:58,220
All right.

1099
01:31:58,763 --> 01:32:01,891

1100
01:32:01,975 --> 01:32:02,975

1102
01:32:15,363 --> 01:32:18,365
Excuse me! What are you doing? Stop!

1103
01:32:40,639 --> 01:32:43,224

Felony trespassing.

1105
01:33:07,666 --> 01:33:09,750
-l didn't call you.
-l know you didn't.

1106
01:33:09,834 --> 01:33:12,836
l have unleashed a raging shit storm
of epic proportions

1107
01:33:12,921 --> 01:33:15,339
on the board of trustees
of that pissant school

1108
01:33:15,423 --> 01:33:18,425
that will not abate until those girls
seek enrollment elsewhere.

1109
01:33:18,510 --> 01:33:20,219
l give them a week.

1110
01:33:22,681 --> 01:33:25,975
l know you think l'm a prick,
but l have my uses.

1111
01:33:30,272 --> 01:33:33,524
Can you come by the office
and talk to the lawyers?

1112
01:33:37,862 --> 01:33:38,988
Okay.

1113
01:33:40,824 --> 01:33:44,243

in the meantime.

1114
01:33:47,497 --> 01:33:50,165
-Thanks for bailing me out.
-No problem!

1115

01:36:10,181 --> 01:36:12,933
-Don't worry about it. That's okay.

Are you running late,
or are you canceling altogether?

1137
01:36:23,987 --> 01:36:25,946
Are you already on your way?

1138
01:36:26,030 --> 01:36:27,656

1139

01:36:33,830 --> 01:36:35,038

You didn't think l forgot about you?

1148
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:05,939
How could l forget you?

1149
01:39:10,945 --> 01:39:12,279
Good morning, ladies.

1150
01:39:12,363 --> 01:39:14,531

Good morning, Mr. Hawkins.

1153
01:39:25,835 --> 01:39:30,005
-Do you know about these?
-Who do you think scanned all the pictures?

1154
01:39:37,055 --> 01:39:38,472
Look at you.

1155
01:39:43,394 --> 01:39:45,187
How old would he be?

1156
01:39:47,774 --> 01:39:49,900
He would've been 28 in May.

1157
01:39:50,443 --> 01:39:53,528
lt's really been that long?
l could've sworn...

1158
01:39:55,239 --> 01:39:57,449
lt was May 20, 1 995.

1159
01:39:59,035 --> 01:40:02,037

1160
01:40:08,419 --> 01:40:09,920
lt's all right.

1161
01:40:15,593 --> 01:40:17,511
What a day.

1162
01:40:39,909 --> 01:40:42,619
Caroline? Hello?

1163
01:42:06,078 --> 01:42:09,498
Whateveryou do in life
wiII be insignificant,

1164
01:42:13,044 --> 01:42:15,712
but it's very important that you do it,

1165
01:42:16,130 --> 01:42:21,176
because nobody eIse wiII.

1166
01:42:25,014 --> 01:42:27,724
Like when someone comes into your Iife,

1167
01:42:28,184 --> 01:42:31,686
and haIf of you says,
"You're nowhere near ready,"

1168
01:42:33,731 --> 01:42:35,690
but the other haIf says,

1169
01:42:36,901 --> 01:42:38,902
"Make her yours forever."

1170
01:42:50,039 --> 01:42:51,373
Michael,

1171
01:42:53,084 --> 01:42:55,919
Caroline asked me what l would say

1172
01:42:57,213 --> 01:42:59,381
if I knew you couId hear me.

1173
01:43:02,176 --> 01:43:03,885
l said l do know.

1174
01:43:07,014 --> 01:43:08,473
"I Iove you.

1175
01:43:12,019 --> 01:43:13,854
"God, l miss you.

1176
01:43:17,859 --> 01:43:19,526
"And I forgive you."
