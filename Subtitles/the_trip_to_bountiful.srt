it was a land of plenty.

All you had to do
is drop seeds in the ground

Mr. Douglas told me
he liked my work

1259
01:08:52,895 --> 01:08:55,230
and he'd be glad
to recommend a raise for me.

the sky so blue?

No, ma'am.

just the day before.

They buried her yesterday.

1270

Mama, I should have made myself
bring you here before.

I'm sorry.

1272

But I thought it'd be easier
for both of us

not to see
the house again.

but now you're here.

Don't you want to come inside
and take a look around a bit?

I don't think I'd better,
mama.

1277

I don't see any use
in it.

Old house has gotten
kind of rundown, hasn't it?

Yes, it has.

1282

I don't think it'll last out
the next Gulf storm.

Doesn't look like
it would.

My papa.

Just like him.

1289
01:10:28,123 --> 01:10:31,492
Course, I've been noticing
as you grow older

1290
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:35,230
that you're looking more
and more like him.

1291
01:10:35,264 --> 01:10:38,633
My papa
was a good-looking man, ludie.

1292
01:10:38,701 --> 01:10:39,767
Was he?

1293

You've seen his picture.

1294

Didn't you think so?
I don't remember.

1295

Been a long time
since I looked at his picture.

1296

Well, he was always considered
a very nice-looking man.

1297

Do you remember my papa
at all, son?

No, ma'am.
Not too well.

1299

I was only 10
when he died, mama.

1300
01:11:02,825 --> 01:11:05,159
I remember
the day he died.

1301
01:11:05,227 --> 01:11:09,030
I heard about it as
I was coming home from school.

1302
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:10,498
Lee Williams told me.

1303
01:11:10,532 --> 01:11:12,667
I thought he was joking.
I called him a liar.

1304
01:11:12,735 --> 01:11:14,402
I remember...

1305
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:18,439
You taking me
into the parlor there

1306
01:11:18,507 --> 01:11:21,409
on the day of the funeral
so I could say goodbye to him.

1307
01:11:24,246 --> 01:11:29,884
I remember the coffin,
people sitting in the room,

1308
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:32,120
old man Joe Williams
took me up on to his knee

1309
01:11:32,187 --> 01:11:35,590
and he told me
grandpapa was his best friend

1310
01:11:35,658 --> 01:11:39,861
and that his life was
a real example for me to follow.

1311
01:11:39,895 --> 01:11:44,299
I remember grandmama
sitting by the coffin crying.

1312
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:48,636
She made me promise
that when I had a son of my own,

1313
01:11:48,671 --> 01:11:50,338
I'd name him
after grandpapa.

1314
01:11:50,406 --> 01:11:51,873
And I would have,
too.

1315
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:56,944
I've never forgotten
that promise.

1316
01:11:56,979 --> 01:12:03,418
Well...
I didn't have a son.

1317

Or a daughter.

1318

that his wife
is expecting their fourth child.

1320

They have two girls
and a boy now,

1321
01:12:12,561 --> 01:12:15,363
and Billy Davidson -- he doesn't
make much more than I do.

01:12:15,397 --> 01:12:17,265
And they certainly seem
to get along.

to hear them tell about
how they all get along.

Everybody has their own job,
even the youngest child.

She's only 3.

1411
01:16:54,743 --> 01:16:56,944
But what if you had died
from the excitement?

1412
01:16:56,979 --> 01:16:58,813
Didn't you know
you could have died?

1413
01:16:58,880 --> 01:16:59,947
I knew.

1414
01:17:00,015 --> 01:17:02,016
And you didn't care?

1415
01:17:03,885 --> 01:17:06,721
I had to come,

1416

[ Sighs ]

1417
01:17:08,156 --> 01:17:11,792
Well, I hope
it is out of your system now.

1418
01:17:11,860 --> 01:17:13,728
It is.
[ Sighs ]

1419
01:17:13,762 --> 01:17:17,865
I've had my trip,
and it's more than enough

1420
01:17:17,899 --> 01:17:21,936
to keep me happy
for the rest of my life.

1421
01:17:22,004 --> 01:17:24,405
Well,
glad to hear that.

1422
01:17:24,439 --> 01:17:26,941
That was the first thing
on my list.

1423
01:17:26,975 --> 01:17:29,910
Number one, there will be
no more running away.

1424
01:17:29,945 --> 01:17:32,179
There will be
no more running away.

1425
01:17:32,214 --> 01:17:33,848
Good.

1426
01:17:33,882 --> 01:17:36,484
Number two, no more hymn singing
when I'm in the apartment.

1427
01:17:36,518 --> 01:17:39,253
When I'm gone,
you can sing your lungs out.

1428
01:17:39,287 --> 01:17:40,454
Agreed?
Agreed.

1429
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:41,722
Number three --

1430
01:17:41,757 --> 01:17:44,258
can't this wait
till we get home, jessie mae?

1431
01:17:44,326 --> 01:17:46,861
Honey, we agreed
I'm gonna handle this.

1432
01:17:46,928 --> 01:17:48,162
No more pouting.

1433
01:17:48,196 --> 01:17:50,598
When I ask a question,
I'd like an answer.

1434
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:52,099
All right.

1435
01:17:52,134 --> 01:17:55,569
Number four, with the condition
that your heart is in,

1436
01:17:55,604 --> 01:18:00,374
I feel you should not run around
the apartment when you can walk.

1437
01:18:00,409 --> 01:18:02,143
All right, jessie mae.

1438
01:18:02,177 --> 01:18:03,344
Well,
that's all.

1439
01:18:03,378 --> 01:18:05,079
Is there anything
you want to say to me?

1440
01:18:05,113 --> 01:18:06,213
No, ma'am.

1441
01:18:06,248 --> 01:18:10,084
Well,
I might as well tell you

1442
01:18:10,118 --> 01:18:13,688
I'm not staying in that house
and watching over you anymore.

1443
01:18:13,722 --> 01:18:15,022
I'm joining
a bridge club.

1444
01:18:15,057 --> 01:18:17,024
I'm going to town
at least twice a week.

1445
01:18:17,059 --> 01:18:18,959
If you go now,
it'll just be a funeral.

1446
01:18:18,994 --> 01:18:20,294
You understand?

1447
01:18:20,328 --> 01:18:22,163
I understand.

1448
01:18:22,197 --> 01:18:23,564
Well,
all right.

1449
01:18:23,598 --> 01:18:27,334
Mama, we also agreed
that we can all try our best

1450
01:18:27,369 --> 01:18:29,070
to get along together.

1451
01:18:29,104 --> 01:18:30,771
Jessie mae also realizes

1452
01:18:30,806 --> 01:18:34,542
that sometimes she gets upset
when she shouldn't.

1453
01:18:34,576 --> 01:18:37,078
Don't you, jessie mae?
Mm-hmm.

1454
01:18:37,112 --> 01:18:40,014
Ludie: Let's start by trying
to have a pleasant ride home.

1455
01:18:40,048 --> 01:18:41,315

That's what
I thought you said.

01:18:52,594 --> 01:18:54,261
Come on.
Let's get going.

1462
01:18:54,296 --> 01:18:56,197
Do we go back
by way of Harrison?

1463
01:18:56,264 --> 01:18:57,531
Yeah.
Oh, good.

1464
01:18:57,566 --> 01:18:59,400
We can stop
at the drug store.

1465
01:18:59,434 --> 01:19:02,169
I am so thirsty,
I could drink 10 Coca-colas.

Are y'all ready?

Yes, ma'am.

Where's your purse?

Oh. I guess
I left it inside.

Where?
Oh, I'll go get it.

1471

No, I want to go.
You'll take all day.

But you wait here.

I don't want to get left alone
in this ramshackley old house.

There's no telling
what's running around in there.

There's nothing around
in there.

Well, there might be some rats
or snakes or something.
