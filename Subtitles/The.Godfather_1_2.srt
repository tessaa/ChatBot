1
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,760
Where have aII the men gone?

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,720
They're aII dead from vendettas.

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,760
There are the names of the dead.

4
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,680
Hey, hey, take me to the America, G.I. !

5
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,480
Hey, hey, take me to the America, G.I. !
CIark GabIe!

6
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,520
America! Take me to the America, G.I. !
CIark GabIe, Rita Hayworth!

7
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,000
Mamma mia what a beauty.

8
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,760
I think you got hit
by the thunderboIt.

9
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,560
In SiciIy women are more
dangerous than shotguns.

10
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,800
Did you have a good hunt?

11
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,480
You know aII the girIs
around here?

12
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,120
We saw some reaI beauties.

13
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,280
One of them struck our friend
Iike a thunderboIt.

14
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,360
She wouId tempt the deviI himseIf.

15
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,120
ReaIIy put together.

16
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,400
Such hair, such mouth!

17
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,760
The girIs around here are
beautifuI...but virtuous.

18
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,360
This one had a purpIe dress...

19
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,000
And a purpIe ribbon in her hair.

20
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,200
A type more Greek than ItaIian.

21
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,000
Do you know her?

22
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,760
There's no girI Iike that
in this town.

23
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,360
My God, I understand!

24
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,680
What's wrong?

25
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,520
Let's go.

26
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,040
It's his daughter.

27
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,560
TeII him to come here.

28
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,200
CaII him.

29
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,960
Fabrizio, you transIate.

30
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,280
I apoIogise if I offended you.

31
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,320
I'm a stranger in this country.

32
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,800
I meant no disrespect
to you or your daughter.

33
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,400
I'm an American, hiding in SiciIy.

34
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,520
My name is MichaeI CorIeone.

35
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,960
There are peopIe who'd pay a Iot
of money for that information.

36
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,200
But then your daughter
wouId Iose a father...

37
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,240
...instead of gaining a husband.

38
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,280
I want to meet your daughter.

39
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,880
With your permission, and under
the supervision of your famiIy.

40
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,160
With aII respect.

41
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,160
Come to my house Sunday morning.
My name is ViteIIi.

42
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,760
What's her name?

43
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,040
I'II knock you dizzy.

44
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,480
Save it for the Iibrary.

45
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,400
We've got to pick up my sister.

46
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,040
What's the matter?

47
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,240
What's the matter?

48
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,320
- It was my fauIt!
- Where is he?

49
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,160
It was my fauIt. I hit him.

50
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,720
I started a fight with him.
I hit him, so he hit me...

51
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,800
I'm just going to get a doctor
to take a Iook at you.

52
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,960
Sonny, pIease don't do anything.

53
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,120
What's the matter with you?
What am I going to do?

54
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,120
Make that baby an orphan
before he's born?

55
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,240
You spic sIobs stiII betting Yankees?

56
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,640
TeII them to stop taking in action.

57
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,800
We Iost enough money Iast week.

58
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,400
Come here, come here!

59
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,000
If you touch my sister again, I'II kiII you.

60
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,760
Hey! We weren't expecting you, Kay.
You shouId caII.

61
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,960
Yes, I have. I've tried writing and caIIing.

62
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,760
- I want to reach MichaeI.
- Nobody knows where he is.

63
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,920
AII we know is that he's aII right.

64
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,640
- What was that?
- An accident, but nobody was hurt.

65
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,640
Tom, wiII you give this Ietter to MichaeI.
PIease?

66
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:10,120
If I accepted that, a court couId prove
I have knowIedge of his whereabouts.

67
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,520
He'II get in touch with you.

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,760

73
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,880

92
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,880
Connie, what's the matter?
I can't hear you.

93
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,320
Connie, taIk Iouder. The baby's crying.

94
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,880
Santino, I can't understand.
I don't know.

95
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,760
Yeah, Connie.

96
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,960
You wait there.

97
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,600
No, you just wait there.

98
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,040
Son-of-a-bitch.

99
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,160
- Son-of-a-bitch!
- What's the matter?

100
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,240
Open the goddamn gate!
Get off your ass.

101
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,080
Sonny!

102
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,520
- Sonny.
- Get out of here!

103
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,920
Go after him, go on!

104
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,600
Son-of-a-bitch. Come on!

105
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,400
Give me a drop.

106
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,160
My wife is crying upstairs.

107
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,760
I hear cars coming to the house.

108
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,360
Consigliere of mine,

109
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,800
teII your Don what everyone
seems to know.

110
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,480
I didn't teII Mama anything.

111
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,840
I was about to come up and wake you
and teII you.

112
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,680
But you needed a drink first.

113
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,840
Yeah.

114
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,040
WeII, now you've had your drink.

115
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:42,240
They shot Sonny on the causeway.
He's dead.

116
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,160
I want no inquiries made.

117
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,520
I want no acts of vengeance.

118
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,280
I want you to arrange a meeting...

119
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,440
...with the heads of the five famiIies.

120
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,360
This war stops now.

121
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,120
CaII Bonasera.

122
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,760
I need him now.

123
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:01,120
This is Tom Hagen. I'm caIIing for
Vito CorIeone, at his request.

124
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,640
You owe your Don a service.

125
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,120
He has no doubt that you will repay it.

126
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:12,040
He will be at your funeral parlour
in one hour. Be there to greet him.

127
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:36,400
WeII, my friend, are you ready
to do me this service?

128
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,560
Yes. What do you want me to do?

129
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:52,320
I want you to use aII your powers
and aII your skiIIs.

130
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,840
I don't want his mother
to see him this way.

131
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,040
Look how they massacred my boy.

132
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,920
It's safer to teach you EngIish!

133
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,640
I know EngIish...

134
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,800
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday,
Wednesday, Friday, Sunday, Saturday.

135
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,320
Greetings, Don Tommasino.

136
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,080
How are things in PaIermo?

137
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:17,440
MichaeI is teaching me to
drive...watch, I'II show you.

138
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,640
How are things in PaIermo?

139
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,600
Young peopIe don't respect
anything any more...

140
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,160
times are changing for the worse.

141
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:35,320
This pIace has become
too dangerous for you.

142
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:42,560
I want you to move to a viIIa
near Siracusa...right now.

143
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,080
What's wrong?

144
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,280
Bad news from America.

145
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:57,240
Your brother, Santino,
they kiIIed him.

146
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,040
Let's go...you promised.

147
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,600
Get the car.

148
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,200
Are you driving yourseIf, Boss?
Is your wife coming with you?

149
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,800
No, take her to her father's house
untiI things are safe.

150
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,320
Okay, anything you say.

151
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,040
CaIo, where is ApoIIonia?

152
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,200
She's going to surprise you.
She wants to drive.

153
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,720
She'II make a good American wife.

154
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,640
Wait, I'II get the baggage.

155
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,320
Fabrizio!

156
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,960
Where are you going?

157
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,320
Wait there! I'II drive to you.

158
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,000
No, ApoIIonia!

159
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:47,760
Don Barzini, I want to thank you
for heIping me organise this meeting,

160
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:53,040
and the other heads of the five famiIies
from New York and New Jersey.

161
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,160
Carmine Cuneo from the Bronx,

162
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,760
and from BrookIyn...

163
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,320
...PhiIip TattagIia.

164
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,440
And from Staten IsIand

165
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,880
we have with us Victor Strachi.

166
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:17,560
And the other associates that came as
far as from CaIifornia and Kansas City

167
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,680
and aII the other territories
of the country. Thank you.

168
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,760
How did things ever get so far?

169
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,920
I don't know.

170
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:38,640
It was so unfortunate, so unnecessary.

171
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,560
TattagIia Iost a son, and I Iost a son.

172
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,840
We're quits. And if TattagIia agrees,

173
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:53,840
then I'm wiIIing to Iet things go on
as before.

174
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,520
We're gratefuI to Don CorIeone
for caIIing this meeting.

175
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,640
We aII know him as a man of his word.
A modest man who Iistens to reason.

176
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,600
Yes, Don Barzini. He's too modest.

177
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:11,000
He had aII the judges and poIiticians
in his pocket.

178
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,880
He refused to share them.

179
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,440
When did I ever refuse
an accommodation?

180
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,080
AII of you know me.

181
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:26,880
When did I ever refuse,
except one time? And why?

182
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:33,880
Because I beIieve this drug business
wiII destroy us in the years to come.

183
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,800
It's not Iike gambIing or Iiquor
or even women,

184
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,800
which is something that most peopIe
want, but is forbidden by the Church.

185
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,480
Even the poIice that have heIped us in
the past with gambIing and other things

186
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:52,560
are going to refuse to heIp us
when it comes to narcotics.

187
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:57,560
I beIieved that then...
and I beIieve that now.

188
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,760
Times have changed.

189
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:04,440
It's not Iike the oId days,
when we couId do anything we wanted.

190
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,280
A refusaI is not the act of a friend.

191
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:12,640
If Don CorIeone had aII the judges and
poIiticians, then he must share them

192
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:17,480
or Iet others use them. He must Iet us
draw the water from the weII.

193
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,520
CertainIy he can present a biII
for such services.

194
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,520
After aII, we're not communists.

195
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,960
I aIso don't beIieve in drugs.

196
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:34,760
For years I paid my peopIe extra, so
they wouIdn't do that kind of business.

197
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,920
Somebody says to them
"I have powders."

198
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:44,960
"If you put up 3-4,000 doIIar investment,
we can make 50,000 distributing."

199
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:50,720
They can't resist. I want to controI it
as a business, keep it respectabIe.

200
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:55,640
I don't want it near schooIs,
I don't want it soId to chiIdren.

201
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,520
That's an infàmia.

202
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,360
In my city we wouId keep the traffic
to the coIoured.

203
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,520
They're animaIs,
so Iet them Iose their souIs.

204
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:15,920
I hoped that we couId come here
and reason together.

205
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:23,440
And I'm wiIIing to do whatever is
necessary to find a peacefuI soIution.

206
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:27,960
We are agreed. The traffic in drugs
wiII be permitted, but controIIed.

207
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:32,360
Don CorIeone wiII give us protection
in the east, and there wiII be peace.

208
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:35,800
I must have strict assurance
from CorIeone.

209
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,320
As time goes by and his position
becomes stronger,

210
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,880
wiII he attempt any individuaI vendetta?

211
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:47,040
We are aII reasonabIe men.
We don't have to give assurances.

212
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,360
You taIk about vengeance.

213
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,520
WiII vengeance bring your son
back to you?

214
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,360
Or my boy to me?

215
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:58,520
I forgo the vengeance of my son.

216
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,720
But I have seIfish reasons.

217
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:09,120
My youngest son was forced
to Ieave this country...

218
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,280
...because of this SoIIozzo business.

219
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:18,080
And I have to make arrangements
to bring him back here safeIy.

220
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,880
CIeared of aII these faIse charges.

221
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,120
But I'm a superstitious man.

222
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:31,520
If an unIucky accident shouId befaII him,
if he shouId be shot by a poIice officer,

223
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:35,040
or if he shouId hang himseIf
in his jaiI ceII,

224
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:39,000
or if he's struck by a boIt of Iightning,

225
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,160
then I'm going to bIame
some of the peopIe in this room.

226
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,800
And that I do not forgive.

227
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,360
But, that aside...

228
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,640
...Iet me say that I swear...

229
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,800
...on the souIs of my grandchiIdren,

230
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,680
that I wiII not be the one to break
the peace we've made here today.

231
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:34,760
ShouId I insist that aII of TattagIia's
drug middIemen have cIean records?

232
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,680
Mention it. Don't insist.

233
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:43,760
- Barzini wiII know without being toId.
- You mean TattagIia.

234
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:50,400
TattagIia's a pimp. He couId never
have outfought Santino.

235
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:59,440
But I didn't know untiI this day
that it was Barzini aII aIong.

236
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,520
Come on, Nancy.

237
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,720
Keep together, everyone. Brian.

238
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,560
Okay, aII right.

239
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,360
How Iong have you been back?

240
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,520
I've been back a year.

241
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,400
Longer than that, I think.

242
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,520
It's good to see you, Kay.

243
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,880
I'm working for my father now, Kay.

244
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:06,040
He's been sick. Very sick.

245
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:13,440
But you're not Iike him. You toId me you
weren't going to become Iike your father.

246
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:18,800
My father is no different
than any other powerfuI man.

247
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,240
Any man who's responsibIe
for other peopIe.

248
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,560
Like a senator or president.

249
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,120
- How naive you sound.
- Why?

250
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,040
They don't have men kiIIed.

251
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,000
Who's being naive, Kay?

252
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:42,480
My father's way of doing things is over.
Even he knows that.

253
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:47,640
In five years the CorIeone famiIy
is going to be compIeteIy Iegitimate.

254
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:52,880
Trust me. That's aII I can teII you
about my business. Kay...

255
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:57,160
MichaeI, why did you come here? Why?

256
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:02,520
What do you want with me after aII
this time? I've been caIIing and writing.

257
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,960
I came because I need you.
I care for you.

258
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:10,600
- PIease stop it, MichaeI.
- Because... I want you to marry me.

259
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,440
- It's too Iate.
- PIease, Kay...

260
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,560
I'II do anything you ask to make up for
what's happened to us.

261
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:26,560
Because that's important, Kay.
Because what's important is that...

262
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:31,080
...we have each other.
That we have a Iife together.

263
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,480
That we have chiIdren. Our chiIdren.

264
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:38,320
Kay, I need you.

265
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,680
And I Iove you.

266
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:05,720
Barzini's peopIe chiseI my territory
and we do nothing about it!

267
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,240
- Soon I'II have no pIace to hang my hat!
- Be patient.

268
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,400
I'm not asking for heIp.
Just take off the handcuffs.

269
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,520
- Be patient.
- We must protect ourseIves.

270
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,960
- Let me recruit some new men.
- No.

271
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:24,000
- Barzini wouId get an excuse to fight.
- Mike, you're wrong.

272
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,800
Don CorIeone...

273
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:30,280
You once said that one day Tessio
and me couId form our own famiIy.

274
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,640
TiII today I wouId never think of it.
I must ask your permission.

275
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,760
MichaeI is now head of the famiIy.

276
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:41,960
If he gives his permission,
then you have my bIessing.

277
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,120
After we make the move to Nevada

278
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,640
you can Ieave the CorIeone famiIy
and go on your own.

279
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:52,800
- How Iong wiII that be?
- Six months.

280
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,840
Forgive me, but with you gone, me and
Pete wiII come under Barzini's thumb.

281
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:04,280
I hate that Barzini. In six months' time
there wiII be nothing Ieft to buiId on.

282
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,320
- Do you have faith in my judgement?
- Yes.

283
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,200
- Do I have your IoyaIty?
- AIways, Godfather.

284
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,680
Then be a friend to MichaeI.
Do as he says.

285
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:23,200
Things are negotiated that'II soIve your
probIems and answer your questions.

286
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,200
That's aII I can teII you now.

287
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,600
CarIo, you grew up in Nevada.

288
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,040
When we make our move there,
you'II be my right-hand man.

289
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,720
Tom Hagen is no Ionger consigliere.
He'II be our Iawyer in Vegas.

290
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:40,240
That's no refIection on Tom,
just how I want it.

291
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:45,120
If I ever need heIp, who's a better
consigliere than my father? That's it.

292
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,120
- Thank you, Poppa.
- I'm happy for you, CarIo.

293
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,800
Mike... Why am I out?

294
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:14,800
You're not a wartime consigliere, Tom.

295
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,600
Things may get rough with the move.

296
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,400
Tom.

297
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:29,280
I advised MichaeI. I never thought
you were a bad consigliere.

298
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:34,640
I thought Santino was a bad Don,
rest in peace.

299
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:38,760
MichaeI has aII my confidence,
just as you do.

300
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:44,200
But there are reasons why you must
have no part in what is going to happen.

301
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,880
- Maybe I couId heIp.
- You're out, Tom.

302
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:38,800
I can't get over the way your face Iooks.
So good!

303
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,280
This doctor did some job. Did Kay
taIk you into it? Hey, hey, hey!

304
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,720
Leave them out here.
He's tired and wants to cIean up.

305
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,320
Let me open the door, aII right?

306
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:01,120
- HeIIo, Mike! WeIcome to Las Vegas!
- AII for you, kid! It's aII his idea.

307
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,960
- Your brother Freddy.
- GirIs?

308
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:10,680
I'II be right back. Keep them occupied.

309
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,720
- Anything you want, kid, anything.
- Who are the girIs?

310
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,880
- That's for you to find out.
- Get rid of them, Fredo.

311
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:25,240
- Hey, Mike...
- I'm here on business. Get rid of them.

312
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,600
I'm tired. Get rid of the band too.

313
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,520
Hey, take off. Take off. Let's go.

314
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,680
Hey, that's it. Hey, AngeIo.

315
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,840
Hey, come on! Scram!

316
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:48,360
Come on, honey. I don't know
what's the matter with him, Johnny.

317
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,560
Sorry.

318
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,360
I don't know. He's tired.

319
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,720
What happened to Moe Greene?

320
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:07,120
He had some business. He said to
give him a caII when the party started.

321
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,560
WeII, give him a caII.

322
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:13,560
- Johnny, how are you?
- Nice to see you, Mike.

323
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,720
- We're proud of you.
- Thanks.

324
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,200
Sit down, I want to taIk to you.
The Don is proud too.

325
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,000
WeII, I owe it aII to him.

326
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:27,080
He knows how gratefuI you are. That's
why he'd Iike to ask a favour of you.

327
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,000
Mike, what can I do?

328
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:36,000
We're thinking of giving up our interests
in the oIive oiI business and settIe here.

329
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:41,840
Moe wiII seII us his share of the casino
and the hoteI, so we'II own aII of it. Tom!

330
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:46,880
Are you sure? Moe Ioves the business.
He never said nothing about seIIing.

331
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:50,240
I'II make him an offer he can't refuse.

332
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,240
See, Johnny...

333
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,480
We figure that entertainment
wouId draw gambIers to the casino.

334
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,640
We hope you'II sign a contract
to appear five times a year.

335
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:08,640
Perhaps convince some of your friends
in the movies to do the same.

336
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,800
We're counting on you.

337
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:17,240
Sure, Mike. I'II do anything
for my godfather.

338
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,840
Good.

339
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:24,440
Hey, Mike! HeIIo, feIIows.
Everybody's here. Freddy, Tom.

340
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,600
- Good to see you.
- How are you, Moe?

341
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:31,760
Have everything? SpeciaIIy prepared
food, the best dancers, and good credit.

342
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:35,760
Draw chips for everybody,
so they can pIay on the house.

343
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,800
Is my credit good enough
to buy you out?

344
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,480
Buy me out?

345
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:48,880
The casino, the hoteI. The
CorIeone famiIy wants to buy you out.

346
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:54,680
The CorIeone famiIy wants to
buy me out? No, I buy you out.

347
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,880
Your casino Ioses money.
We can do better.

348
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:02,520
- You think I'm skimming off the top?
- You're unIucky.

349
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,880
You Guineas make me Iaugh.

350
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:14,280
I took Freddy in when you had a bad
time, and now you try to push me out!

351
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:18,080
You did that because we bankroIIed
your casino

352
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:23,080
and the MoIinari famiIy guaranteed
his safety. Let's taIk business.

353
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:28,240
Yes. First of aII, you're aII done. You
don't have that kind of muscIe anymore.

354
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:32,600
The Godfather is sick. You're getting
chased out of New York by the others.

355
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,360
Do you think you can come to my hoteI
and take over?

356
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:41,280
I taIked to Barzini. I can make a deaI
with him and stiII keep my hoteI!

357
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,720
Is that why you sIapped my brother
around in pubIic?

358
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:49,480
That was nothing, Mike.
Moe didn't mean nothing by that.

359
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:53,640
He fIies off the handIe sometimes,
but we're good friends.

360
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:58,160
I have a business to run.
I've got to kick asses sometimes.

361
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:02,080
We had an argument,
so I had to straighten him out.

362
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,720
You straightened my brother out?

363
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:09,200
He was banging cocktaiI waitresses!
PIayers couIdn't get a drink.

364
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,680
What's wrong with you?

365
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:19,400
I Ieave for New York tomorrow.
Think about a price.

366
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,040
Son-of-a-bitch!

367
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:26,360
I'm Moe Greene! I made my bones
when you were out with cheerIeaders.

368
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,760
Wait a minute, Moe. I have an idea.

369
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:33,320
Tom, you're the consigliere.
TaIk to the Don...

370
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:38,360
Just a minute. Don is semi-retired and
Mike is in charge of the famiIy business.

371
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:42,160
If you have anything to say,
say it to MichaeI.

372
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:50,440
Mike, you don't come to Las Vegas and
taIk to a man Iike Moe Greene Iike that!

373
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,920
Fredo...

374
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:57,080
You're my oIder brother, and I Iove you.

375
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:02,520
But don't ever take sides with anyone
against the famiIy again.

376
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:16,720
I have to see my father and his peopIe,
so have dinner without me.

377
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:23,040
This weekend we'II go out. We'II go to
the city, see a show and have dinner.

378
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,480
Your sister wants to ask you something.

379
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,760
- Let her ask.
- She's afraid to.

380
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,520
They want you to be godfather
to their boy.

381
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,680
- We'II see.
- WiII you?

382
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:42,240
Let me think about it. Come on.

383
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:53,000
Barzini wiII move against you first.

384
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:57,400
He'II set up a meeting with someone
you absoIuteIy trust.

385
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:00,440
Guaranteeing your safety.

386
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:04,000
And at that meeting
you'II be assassinated.

387
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,400
I Iike to drink wine more than I used to.

388
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:16,040
- Anyway, I'm drinking more.
- It's good for you, Pop.

389
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,800
I don't know.

390
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,280
Are you happy with your wife
and chiIdren?

391
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:30,840
- Very happy.
- That's good.

392
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,720
I hope you don't mind the way I keep
going over this Barzini business.

393
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:40,280
- No, not at aII.
- It's an oId habit.

394
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:44,200
I spend my Iife trying not to be careIess.

395
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:49,240
Women and chiIdren can be careIess,
but not men.

396
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,160
- How's your boy?
- He's good.

397
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:57,200
He Iooks more Iike you every day.

398
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:03,920
He's smarter than I am. He's three
and can read the funny papers.

399
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,040
Read the funny papers.

400
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:20,080
I want you to arrange for a teIephone
man to check aII in- and out-going caIIs.

401
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:26,040
- I did it aIready. I took care of that, Pop.
- That's right. I forgot.

402
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,760
What's the matter?

403
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:34,320
What's bothering you?

404
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:41,640
I'II handIe it. I toId you I can handIe it,
so I'II handIe it.

405
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:58,240
I knew that Santino wouId have to
go through aII this.

406
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:01,320
And Fredo...

407
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,040
Fredo was, weII...

408
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,920
But I never wanted this for you.

409
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:16,240
I worked my whoIe Iife. I don't apoIogise
for taking care of my famiIy.

410
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:20,160
And I refused to be a fooI,

411
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:24,520
dancing on a string
heId by aII those big shots.

412
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:30,040
I don't apoIogise. That's my Iife,
but I thought that...

413
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:36,200
...that when it was your time, you wouId
be the one to hoId the strings.

414
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:43,040
Senator CorIeone. Governor CorIeone.
Something.

415
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:45,560
Another pezzo da novanta.

416
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:47,680
WeII...

417
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,600
Just wasn't enough time, MichaeI.
Wasn't enough time.

418
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,480
We'II get there, Pop. We'II get there.

419
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:06,920
Now Iisten, whoever comes to you
with this Barzini meeting,

420
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:10,400
he's the traitor. Don't forget that.

421
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,480
Can I hoId it, pIease?

422
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:46,360
- Can I water these?
- Yes, go ahead.

423
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:49,560
Over here, over here.

424
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,200
Be carefuI. You're spiIIing it.

425
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,480
Antony!

426
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,680
Come here, come here.

427
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,920
That's it. We'II put it right there.

428
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,680
I'II show you something. Come here.

429
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,840
Stand there.

430
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:27,520
Give me an orange!

431
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,800
That's a new trick.

432
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:50,240
You run in there. Run in there.

433
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,640
Where are you?

434
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:57,520
Mike, can I have a minute?

435
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,800
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.

436
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,800
He says we can straighten out
any of our probIems.

437
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,000
- You taIked to him?
- Yeah.

438
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:20,600
I can arrange security. On my territory.

439
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,880
- AII right?
- AII right.

440
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:45,160
Do you know how they're going to
come at you?

441
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:51,680
They're arranging a meeting
in BrookIyn. Tessio's ground.

442
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:55,040
Where I'II be safe.

443
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,960
I aIways thought it wouId be
CIemenza, not Tessio.

444
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:14,480
It's the smart move.
Tessio was aIways smarter.

445
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:18,280
But I'm going to wait.

446
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,680
After the baptism.

447
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:25,040
I've decided to be godfather
to Connie's baby.

448
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,920
And then I'II meet with Don Barzini

449
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:33,960
and TattagIia.
AII the heads of the five famiIies.

450
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:53,760
MichaeI, do you beIieve in God, the

l do.

456
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:12,360
MichaeI Francis Rizzi,

457
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:19,640
I do renounce him.

458
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:30,360
And aII his works?

459
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:44,640
I do renounce them.

460
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:47,440
Oh, God!

461
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:53,840
- And aII his pomps?
- I do renounce them.

462
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:12,440
MichaeI Rizzi, wiII you be baptised?

463
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:14,080
I wiII.

464
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:26,840
MichaeI Rizzi, go in peace, and may
the Lord be with you. Amen.

465
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:41,520
Kay!

466
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:43,720
Kiss your godfather.

467
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:12,440
Can't go to Vegas. Something's come
up. Everybody has to Ieave without us.

468
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:15,840
- Mike, it's our first vacation!
- Connie, pIease.

469
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:20,000
Go back to the house, wait for my caII.
It's important.

470
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:22,480
I'II onIy be a coupIe of days.

471
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:40,720
We're on our way to BrookIyn.

472
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:46,280
- I hope Mike can get us a good deaI.
- I'm sure he wiII.

473
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:58,240
SaI, Tom, the boss says he'II come in a
separate car, so you two go on ahead.

474
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:01,880
- That screws up my arrangements.
- That's what he said.

475
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:04,520
I can't go either, SaI.

476
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:20,160
TeII Mike it was onIy business.
I aIways Iiked him.

477
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:23,800
- He understands that.
- Excuse me, SaI.

478
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:32,480
Tom, can you get me off the hook?

479
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:36,560
- For oId times' sake?
- Can't do it, SaIIy.

480
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:21,960
You have to answer for Santino, CarIo.

481
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:31,440
- Mike, you got it aII wrong.
- You fingered Sonny for Barzini.

482
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:35,120
That IittIe farce you pIayed
with my sister.

483
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:40,160
- You think that couId fooI a CorIeone?
- I'm innocent. I swear on the kids.

484
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:43,520
- PIease, don't do this.
- Sit down.

485
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:48,320
Don't do this to me, pIease.

486
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,800
Barzini is dead.

487
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:02,480
So is PhiIip TattagIia.

488
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:05,320
Moe Greene.

489
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:10,200
Strachi. Cuneo.

490
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:16,440
Today I settIe aII famiIy business,
so don't teII me you're innocent, CarIo.

491
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:19,080
Admit what you did.

492
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:24,200
Get him a drink.

493
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:32,040
Come on.

494
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:37,160
Don't be afraid, CarIo. Do you think
I'd make my sister a widow?

495
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:41,440
I'm godfather to your son, CarIo.

496
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:50,360
Go ahead, drink, drink.

497
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:58,920
No, you're out of the famiIy business.
That's your punishment.

498
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:02,880
You're finished.
I'm putting you on a pIane to Vegas.

499
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:04,560
Tom.

500
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:12,080
I want you to stay there. Understand?

501
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:14,920
OnIy don't teII me you're innocent.

502
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:20,400
Because it insuIts my inteIIigence.
Makes me very angry.

503
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:26,840
Who approached you?

504
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:29,600
TattagIia or Barzini?

505
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:39,200
It was Barzini.

506
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:44,320
Good.

507
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:53,680
There's a car waiting outside
to take you to the airport.

508
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:57,600
I'II caII your wife and teII her
what fIight you're on.

509
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:04,520
- Mike...
- Get out of my sight.

510
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:29,920
HeIIo, CarIo.

511
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:30,760
- I'm trying to teII you...
- Mama, pIease!

512
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:40,680
MichaeI!

513
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:43,920
- What is it?
- Where is he?

514
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:49,960
MichaeI, you Iousy bastard!
You kiIIed my husband.

515
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:53,960
You waited untiI Papa died,
so nobody couId stop you.

516
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:57,120
You bIamed him for Sonny.
Everybody did.

517
01:07:57,320 --> 01:08:03,080
But you never thought about me!
Now what are we going to do?

518
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:04,920
Connie.

519
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:11,800
Why do you think he kept CarIo at the
MaII? He knew he was going to kiII him.

520
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:17,280
And you stood godfather to our baby.
You Iousy coId-hearted bastard!

521
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:21,400
Want to know how many men he had
kiIIed with CarIo? Read the papers!

522
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:24,920
That's your husband,
that's your husband!

523
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:36,880
No! No, no...

524
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:40,600
Take her upstairs. Get her a doctor.

525
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:02,600
She's hystericaI.

526
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:08,760
HystericaI.

527
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:13,040
MichaeI, is it true?

528
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:17,400
- Don't ask me about my business, Kay.
- Is it true?

529
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:21,160
Don't ask me about my business.
Enough!

530
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:41,120
AII right.

531
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:45,520
This one time.

532
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:53,040
This one time I'II Iet you ask me
about my affairs.

533
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:00,760
Is it true?

534
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:05,240
Is it?

535
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:08,120
No.

536
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:24,400
I guess we both need a drink. Come on.

537
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:56,240
Don CorIeone.

538
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:56,240
