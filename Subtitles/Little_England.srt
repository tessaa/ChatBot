LITTLE ENGLAND

2
00:00:22,027 --> 00:00:25,656
<i>Let a love...</i>

3
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:30,825
<i>... that does not save...</i>

4
00:00:32,387 --> 00:00:37,700
<i>... find me alone...</i>

5
00:00:42,027 --> 00:00:48,580
<i>One night, one dawn...</i>

6
00:00:52,507 --> 00:00:57,501
<i>One night, one dawn.</i>

7
00:01:01,667 --> 00:01:05,501
<i>Our love...</i>

8
00:01:05,947 --> 00:01:09,383
<i>... a sea...</i>

9
00:01:11,307 --> 00:01:17,143
<i>... a tempest in the soul...</i>

10
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:24,264
<i>Love...</i>

11
00:01:24,547 --> 00:01:29,177
<i>... a myriad waves...</i>

12
00:01:30,627 --> 00:01:36,145
<i>... and it all begins again...</i>

13
00:01:46,787 --> 00:01:49,824
BASED ON THE NOVEL
BY IOANNA KARYSTIANI

14
00:01:55,267 --> 00:01:58,623
A FILM BY
PANTELIS VOULGARIS

15
00:02:00,467 --> 00:02:03,265
There they are! They're here!
You can see them!

16
00:02:03,507 --> 00:02:06,305
ANDROS 1930

17
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:10,222
Where's Maritsa?
Didn't she hear the siren?

18
00:02:10,267 --> 00:02:12,144
You can see it!

19
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:15,579
They're probably looking at us
too, through their binoculars.

20
00:02:16,547 --> 00:02:18,822
Till we meet again, Yannis!

21
00:02:22,107 --> 00:02:24,940
It's the OSTRIA
on its way to Piraeus.

22
00:02:26,307 --> 00:02:29,424
<i>Odessa, 2nd May 1930.</i>

23
00:02:30,107 --> 00:02:32,223
<i>My beloved Orsa...</i>

24
00:02:32,587 --> 00:02:36,978
<i>My uncle Emilios tells no one
that he gives you my letters.</i>

25
00:02:37,067 --> 00:02:41,026
<i>I've taught him well.
So, don't be afraid.</i>

26
00:02:41,467 --> 00:02:43,537
<i>We'll be in Piraeus in mid-May.</i>

27
00:02:43,827 --> 00:02:48,264
<i>We unload and 3-4 days later
we head for Andros. I can't wait.</i>

28
00:02:48,307 --> 00:02:51,026
<i>I hope you feel the same way
about seeing me.</i>

29
00:02:51,067 --> 00:02:54,104
<i>When I left, you were 17
and now you're 20.</i>

30
00:02:54,347 --> 00:02:56,258
<i>Spyros Maltabes.</i>

31
00:03:17,147 --> 00:03:18,057
For you.

32
00:03:31,347 --> 00:03:35,260
Orsa, the Ostria we'll be sailing off
again in two months.

33
00:03:37,307 --> 00:03:42,540
Spyros, will we be able to see
each other many more times?

34
00:03:44,267 --> 00:03:46,986
As you long as you keep finding
good excuses!

35
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:50,542
I'll tell them I'm going
to Grandma Orsa.

36
00:03:51,067 --> 00:03:56,300
I'll sit with her
for fifteen minutes or so...

37
00:03:57,347 --> 00:03:59,019
...and after that...

38
00:04:25,547 --> 00:04:28,345
<i>Las senales del alma...</i>

39
00:04:34,027 --> 00:04:37,303
<i>You could even catch
the radio signals of the souls...</i>

40
00:04:37,547 --> 00:04:42,496
<i>Now who will I tell about the
heartache that is gnawing at me?</i>

41
00:04:42,547 --> 00:04:44,697
<i>Same yearning...</i>

42
00:04:45,427 --> 00:04:48,737
<i>You in Chile, me in Buenos Aires.</i>

43
00:04:58,427 --> 00:05:02,818
<i>Savvas, you may be rotting
in the Atlantic...</i>

44
00:05:03,267 --> 00:05:05,576
<i>... but I'm not wasting
my time either.</i>

45
00:05:06,107 --> 00:05:09,417
<i>The two-story house is
finished. Their dowry.</i>

46
00:05:09,987 --> 00:05:12,581
<i>It's time I married them off.</i>

47
00:05:17,467 --> 00:05:19,185
Dry land, Nikiforos...

48
00:05:21,347 --> 00:05:23,258
Foreign soil...

49
00:05:25,547 --> 00:05:27,299
...but still soil...

50
00:05:36,147 --> 00:05:37,546
Moscha!

51
00:05:39,387 --> 00:05:41,218
Moscha!

52
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:55,663
Write up the receipts,
all the expenses...

53
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:58,661
...and send them to your father.

54
00:06:01,867 --> 00:06:03,778
Tomorrow at the latest.

55
00:06:04,147 --> 00:06:06,707
Dad will be so worried...

56
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:09,098
...how much you paid
for the teacups...

57
00:06:09,147 --> 00:06:12,583
...how much for the colanders,
the soaps...

58
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:18,417
Use the thinnest paper. We don't
want to pay a fortune in stamps.

59
00:06:18,867 --> 00:06:21,700
Or worry about the weight
of feeling either...

60
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:27,019
Karaoulanis...

61
00:06:27,307 --> 00:06:30,060
Sofas for upstairs and
sofas for downstairs.

62
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:32,025
Two silver tureens...

63
00:06:32,067 --> 00:06:36,026
Lace curtains for upstairs and
lace curtains for downstairs.

64
00:06:36,267 --> 00:06:39,498
I'll be equally fair to both of you,
both of you.

65
00:06:41,587 --> 00:06:43,464
Karaoulanis...

66
00:06:43,907 --> 00:06:46,979
One for the upstairs house,
one for the downstairs house.

67
00:06:47,027 --> 00:06:49,985
Don't forget two pairs
of binoculars as well...

68
00:06:50,027 --> 00:06:52,097
For us to look through them...

69
00:06:52,147 --> 00:06:54,024
...as we grow old and rusty...

70
00:06:54,267 --> 00:06:56,144
...like the railings of the balcony.

71
00:07:03,147 --> 00:07:09,177
<i>Recipient: Savvas Saltaferos,
Captain.</i>

72
00:07:11,187 --> 00:07:14,463
<i>Ship: SS PENELOPE, Argentina.</i>

73
00:07:18,227 --> 00:07:19,979
<i>Ready...</i>

74
00:07:21,907 --> 00:07:25,024
Yesterday we had the memorial
service for the radio operator...

75
00:07:25,267 --> 00:07:27,383
...who worked with my father.
- I was there.

76
00:07:28,107 --> 00:07:31,224
But we shouldn't be talking
about such things now.

77
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:34,577
I can't bear the thought
that men are lost at sea...

78
00:07:34,907 --> 00:07:36,101
...far away...

79
00:07:38,147 --> 00:07:40,741
...and their remains
never return to Andros.

80
00:07:40,947 --> 00:07:42,824
His grave here is empty.

81
00:07:44,107 --> 00:07:47,986
Did they bury him in Argentina?
In Uruguay?

82
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:51,227
He was lucky to die near land.

83
00:07:52,947 --> 00:07:56,986
The Maltabes men, grandfather,
father, uncles...

84
00:07:57,187 --> 00:07:59,462
...we drown in the middle
of the ocean.

85
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:03,219
We like it there.

86
00:08:04,507 --> 00:08:06,384
Don't you talk that way...

87
00:08:07,027 --> 00:08:08,142
Don't you talk that way...

88
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:09,939
What with the shipwrecks...

89
00:08:10,147 --> 00:08:13,105
...what with the diseases that
suddenly break out at sea.

90
00:08:13,147 --> 00:08:16,583
I drive a hard bargain
with the Grim Reaper.

91
00:08:17,347 --> 00:08:20,020
- I'm not afraid.
- But I am.

92
00:08:29,627 --> 00:08:31,777
Anyone who drowned...

93
00:08:47,147 --> 00:08:48,819
...repented...

94
00:09:08,307 --> 00:09:12,300
I fell in love at 12,
got engaged at 13...

95
00:09:12,707 --> 00:09:16,780
...got married at 14,
was widowed at 15.

96
00:09:21,867 --> 00:09:24,904
The SS MAROUSIO sank
with all hands on board.

97
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:27,456
That's why I can
no longer look at the sea.

98
00:09:28,547 --> 00:09:30,742
That's why I never eat fish.

99
00:09:31,707 --> 00:09:35,825
I can't get it out of my head that
they may have devoured Vangelis.

100
00:09:44,107 --> 00:09:45,222
It's not the only one.

101
00:09:45,547 --> 00:09:47,458
I embroider
all the island's shipwrecks.

102
00:09:47,747 --> 00:09:50,307
How can you bear it?
You shouldn't do it any more.

103
00:09:50,547 --> 00:09:52,105
I can't.
I don't want to...

104
00:09:52,147 --> 00:09:55,059
...abandon plaintive souls?
- Well, I do!

105
00:09:55,107 --> 00:09:59,146
I want everything I can't have...
Everything they won't let me have.

106
00:10:01,387 --> 00:10:02,183
Katerina...

107
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:09,741
- I want his initials, you know whose.
- Moscha!

108
00:10:09,987 --> 00:10:11,978
I want you to embroider them
for me on a handkerchief.

109
00:10:12,027 --> 00:10:14,666
- I can't do that.
- You'll get half a little sovereign.

110
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:15,777
No.

111
00:10:15,987 --> 00:10:17,943
He's a foreigner, Moscha...

112
00:10:19,027 --> 00:10:20,699
And he's not a seaman...

113
00:10:20,907 --> 00:10:23,375
That's why I've set my sights
on him.

114
00:10:32,027 --> 00:10:33,255
Spyros...

115
00:10:33,547 --> 00:10:37,062
We're having a soiree
at the lighthouse keeper's...

116
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:39,139
And you took the rum too...

117
00:10:39,187 --> 00:10:41,018
Cuban.

118
00:10:41,067 --> 00:10:43,627
It's the best way to get drunk...

119
00:10:43,987 --> 00:10:45,306
I know... I know...

120
00:10:45,747 --> 00:10:48,466
After the third glass I'll be...

121
00:10:49,307 --> 00:10:50,660
...in Vera Cruz!

122
00:10:52,587 --> 00:10:53,986
After the fifth?

123
00:10:54,027 --> 00:10:56,461
Vera Cruz is just fine, boy...

124
00:11:02,347 --> 00:11:07,375
Uncle Emilios, why don't you come
with us on one last journey...

125
00:11:08,587 --> 00:11:10,225
...for old times sake...

126
00:11:11,787 --> 00:11:15,177
The sea rejected me.
Willy-nilly...

127
00:11:17,107 --> 00:11:21,020
- It threw me up.
- Yes... the Bay of Biscay.

128
00:11:22,147 --> 00:11:24,741
We won't be crossing
the Bay of Biscay.

129
00:11:25,067 --> 00:11:29,026
I cross the Bay of Biscay
every night...

130
00:11:29,427 --> 00:11:31,099
...in my sleep...

131
00:11:31,147 --> 00:11:33,297
...tied with ropes...

132
00:11:33,347 --> 00:11:35,019
...all of us tied...

133
00:11:35,347 --> 00:11:40,660
...and the waves untie them and
sweep the 16-year old kid away.

134
00:11:43,027 --> 00:11:46,337
Did you go... to the five?

135
00:11:50,187 --> 00:11:52,143
Every afternoon... late.

136
00:11:55,267 --> 00:11:56,825
I tell them...

137
00:11:57,227 --> 00:11:58,785
...good evening.

138
00:11:59,027 --> 00:12:03,179
<i>Let a love that does not save...</i>

139
00:12:03,907 --> 00:12:08,105
<i>... finds me alone.</i>

140
00:12:08,987 --> 00:12:12,377
<i>One night, one dawn...</i>

141
00:12:12,427 --> 00:12:14,622
Shoulder to waist 48.

142
00:12:14,987 --> 00:12:18,582
<i>One night, one dawn.</i>

143
00:12:19,387 --> 00:12:21,025
98.

144
00:12:21,267 --> 00:12:24,976
<i>Our love a sea...</i>

145
00:12:25,027 --> 00:12:28,099
I'll have it ready for you
next Saturday.

146
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:30,900
<i>... a tempest in the soul...</i>

147
00:12:31,267 --> 00:12:36,182
<i>Love a myriad waves...</i>

148
00:12:36,227 --> 00:12:40,505
<i>... and it all begins again.</i>

149
00:12:45,667 --> 00:12:47,225
Vivika!

150
00:12:48,507 --> 00:12:51,180
Run along and water the dahlias,
my child.

151
00:12:51,227 --> 00:12:53,024
So, what were we saying, Mouraina?

152
00:12:53,067 --> 00:12:57,504
Ah, yes... the man's cock
was like a mainmast...

153
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,097
...before he left.

154
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:05,221
If he's horny now, it's other women's
panties he'll be dirtying.

155
00:13:05,547 --> 00:13:08,459
Just like Nikiforos,
God rest his soul. A bigamist.

156
00:13:09,067 --> 00:13:14,061
He had a second wife in Chile
and two Chilean daughters...

157
00:13:14,347 --> 00:13:17,623
...with the same names
of his daughters here.

158
00:13:17,987 --> 00:13:19,705
You mean Tassoula and Vangelio?

159
00:13:19,947 --> 00:13:21,778
Tassoula and Vangelio in Chile?

160
00:13:22,107 --> 00:13:24,462
Did Savvas write you
about it, Mina?

161
00:13:24,787 --> 00:13:27,859
He never writes about such things
to me, Mouraina.

162
00:13:28,267 --> 00:13:31,942
It's Nikiforos' widow herself who
complained about it to my face.

163
00:13:32,267 --> 00:13:37,057
I saved the best lemon orchard
for you. Sixty trees.

164
00:13:39,427 --> 00:13:43,056
For you, only the biggest bargains,
for the others, the leftovers.

165
00:13:43,467 --> 00:13:46,186
But we had agreed 18 pounds.

166
00:13:46,467 --> 00:13:48,344
15 or I leave.

167
00:13:53,267 --> 00:13:57,021
We'll sign the deed the day
after tomorrow. St. Marina's Day.

168
00:13:57,067 --> 00:13:58,978
God bless investments, eh?

169
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:04,144
The day after tomorrow,
on St. Marina's Day.

170
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:08,420
Calm down, Mina, I've got
another windfall for you.

171
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:12,262
<i>Rock fish, red mullet, bogue,
sea bream, red snapper!</i>

172
00:14:12,787 --> 00:14:18,419
Nikos Vatokouzis. Unmarried.
A captain at 32.

173
00:14:18,787 --> 00:14:21,506
Owns half shares in two steamboats.

174
00:14:21,867 --> 00:14:23,664
And he studied mathematics.

175
00:14:24,027 --> 00:14:25,380
He didn't graduate though...

176
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:30,183
His governess Annezio is the
most loyal and faithful servant...

177
00:14:30,227 --> 00:14:32,263
...in all of Andros.

178
00:14:32,507 --> 00:14:33,906
And the deafest.

179
00:14:35,067 --> 00:14:36,978
And what about his house?

180
00:14:37,187 --> 00:14:40,224
Isn't it one of the most beautiful
residences in the city?

181
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:43,186
We've got a house too, Kourmoulis.

182
00:14:45,107 --> 00:14:48,099
His late mother lent you
the money for the plot.

183
00:14:48,147 --> 00:14:50,581
I keep all my old records.

184
00:14:52,187 --> 00:14:55,179
She also stood by me
on other occasions.

185
00:14:57,827 --> 00:14:59,818
Always open-handed.

186
00:15:00,627 --> 00:15:02,060
Now you're talking.

187
00:15:03,227 --> 00:15:07,220
<i>Peach blossoms on his sides...</i>

188
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:10,905
<i>... she had said to me, in terror.</i>

189
00:15:11,147 --> 00:15:15,345
<i>It was the rashes of syphilis...
her husband's.</i>

190
00:15:16,947 --> 00:15:22,021
<i>Then... he went blind, crazy...</i>

191
00:15:22,747 --> 00:15:24,624
<i>And then, he kicked the bucket.</i>

192
00:15:24,867 --> 00:15:26,220
<i>The son is clean.</i>

193
00:15:35,667 --> 00:15:37,464
<i>Postman!</i>

194
00:15:37,747 --> 00:15:39,146
<i>Letters!</i>

195
00:15:39,667 --> 00:15:41,737
<i>From Brazil!</i>

196
00:15:42,427 --> 00:15:44,895
<i>From Canada!
From Poland!</i>

197
00:15:45,267 --> 00:15:48,100
<i>Argentina! Panama!</i>

198
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:50,578
<i>Australia!</i>

199
00:16:18,387 --> 00:16:22,903
That's your color.
Cypress green.

200
00:16:45,067 --> 00:16:46,898
I'm leaving tomorrow.

201
00:16:51,227 --> 00:16:54,060
When I return I'll be a captain.

202
00:16:55,947 --> 00:16:58,415
And we'll get married
the very same day.

203
00:16:58,867 --> 00:17:01,142
And what revelry there'll be...

204
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:03,298
...with dulcimers and lutes...

205
00:17:13,027 --> 00:17:15,495
The cave in the rock...

206
00:17:21,347 --> 00:17:23,224
The cypress trees...

207
00:17:24,507 --> 00:17:26,577
...the little bridge...

208
00:17:40,187 --> 00:17:42,257
The Maltabes Circle!

209
00:17:45,187 --> 00:17:47,542
That's what I named it.

210
00:18:04,227 --> 00:18:07,378
For as long as you're away I'll come
to our places alone and remember.

211
00:18:12,427 --> 00:18:14,019
No jasmine today?

212
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:20,544
Their fragrance is best suited
to the dusk...

213
00:18:23,867 --> 00:18:25,141
...the night...

214
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:30,657
I'll plant ten in our flowerbeds.

215
00:18:31,507 --> 00:18:34,340
We'll stay awake all night
and breathe them in.

216
00:18:34,587 --> 00:18:37,101
We'll stay awake all night
and breathe them in.

217
00:18:53,227 --> 00:18:56,264
Wait for me, eh?

218
00:19:25,107 --> 00:19:27,143
Wait for me!

219
00:19:30,547 --> 00:19:33,664
<i>- The valerian root didn't work.
- No good for you either?</i>

220
00:19:34,027 --> 00:19:38,384
<i>Then, my dear, let's try something
more potent... Veronal.</i>

221
00:19:41,587 --> 00:19:46,058
Have you ever prescribed Salvarsan
for Nikos Vatokouzis?

222
00:19:46,427 --> 00:19:48,224
No.

223
00:19:51,387 --> 00:19:55,505
Bismuth! Mercury? Iodine?

224
00:19:57,107 --> 00:19:59,337
No.

225
00:20:00,027 --> 00:20:01,779
No.

226
00:20:04,827 --> 00:20:07,295
Tell me, Resvanis...

227
00:20:09,827 --> 00:20:13,581
...this isn't a matter
of doctor-patient confidentiality?

228
00:20:15,587 --> 00:20:19,023
No, Mina, because I realize
what it's all about.

229
00:20:20,907 --> 00:20:24,297
I'm not a venereologist. I'm a GP.

230
00:20:25,387 --> 00:20:28,777
But based on timelines
and the records I keep...

231
00:20:29,787 --> 00:20:33,143
...I believe Vatokouzis' son
was conceived...

232
00:20:33,547 --> 00:20:38,575
...2 years before the old man, God
rest his soul, contracted the disease.

233
00:20:43,347 --> 00:20:45,622
<i>Music lovers of Andros.</i>

234
00:20:45,867 --> 00:20:50,497
<i>This evening Miss Hexadaktylou
will be giving a piano recital.</i>

235
00:20:51,267 --> 00:20:55,499
<i>Don't miss the musical feast
with European melodies!</i>

236
00:20:57,467 --> 00:21:01,585
165 postcards.
My pupils don't forget me.

237
00:21:03,587 --> 00:21:06,101
And Mikes' pupils loved him.

238
00:21:06,467 --> 00:21:10,301
<i>Your attention please!
At 9:00 this evening...</i>

239
00:21:10,547 --> 00:21:12,902
I'm a literature teacher
by profession.

240
00:21:13,227 --> 00:21:15,616
I'm still a schoolgirl
by disposition.

241
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:19,537
Go on, tell me...
Who is he?

242
00:21:25,427 --> 00:21:27,304
Like an avalanche in the Alps!

243
00:21:27,547 --> 00:21:30,220
Ah! An off-topic answer.
I'll give you a D!

244
00:21:30,547 --> 00:21:33,186
He gave me an A.

245
00:21:33,547 --> 00:21:36,107
But what am I saying?
He must be a seaman. What else?

246
00:21:36,147 --> 00:21:40,140
Voyages, oceans,
thousands of miles...

247
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:43,897
The blue flows
and we flow with it.

248
00:21:47,027 --> 00:21:50,303
So, who is he?
Name and surname.

249
00:21:50,627 --> 00:21:53,824
- I'd rather not say.
- He isn't married, is he?

250
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:55,580
No!

251
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:57,539
No!

252
00:21:57,907 --> 00:22:01,217
You've always been such
a one for secrets...

253
00:22:01,467 --> 00:22:03,742
You feed on them,
you're bewitched by them.

254
00:22:04,667 --> 00:22:08,376
I felt my heart burst open
like a pomegranate...

255
00:22:08,987 --> 00:22:10,818
...without a sound...

256
00:22:11,187 --> 00:22:14,065
...and the little rubies
forming arcs in the air...

257
00:22:14,107 --> 00:22:16,177
...stumbling over my shoulders...

258
00:22:16,227 --> 00:22:19,617
...leaping on the cobbled streets
like fireflies.

259
00:22:19,987 --> 00:22:21,420
Go on...

260
00:22:24,627 --> 00:22:27,664
He looks at me and I'm on fire...

261
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:31,661
...like a little piece of coal
in an incense burner.

262
00:22:31,907 --> 00:22:33,181
He just looks at you?

263
00:22:37,347 --> 00:22:39,019
Nana...

264
00:22:39,747 --> 00:22:44,025
...a man's fingers are heavy.

265
00:22:45,427 --> 00:22:49,500
They just touch you
and you turn to stone.

266
00:23:30,707 --> 00:23:33,983
He must be sailing the Cape Verde
as we speak.

267
00:23:35,187 --> 00:23:40,625
And you came at his behest
ask for the hand of my Orsa...

268
00:23:40,947 --> 00:23:43,097
...who is, by general consent...

269
00:23:43,347 --> 00:23:47,545
...10-15 kilos short of
being a true Aphrodite!

270
00:23:50,267 --> 00:23:56,137
See here Emilios, your nephew
has yet to make his fortune.

271
00:23:58,907 --> 00:24:00,784
He's a second mate.

272
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:04,224
There are captains who have asked me
for her hand in marriage.

273
00:24:04,267 --> 00:24:07,577
Spyros will be a captain too,
before he turns 30.

274
00:24:07,987 --> 00:24:09,136
Will be...

275
00:24:12,307 --> 00:24:14,582
He doesn't even have his own house.

276
00:24:16,547 --> 00:24:19,141
- He will have.
- Will have...

277
00:24:19,187 --> 00:24:23,100
He's a hard worker.
Quick on the uptake.

278
00:24:24,187 --> 00:24:26,223
Outgoing...

279
00:24:26,267 --> 00:24:28,781
I raised him...

280
00:24:35,027 --> 00:24:37,143
...since he was five.

281
00:24:37,187 --> 00:24:41,260
A governess.
Knee deep in pigeon shit.

282
00:24:43,507 --> 00:24:49,104
Captain Savvas respects those
who make a living at sea.

283
00:24:52,027 --> 00:24:54,336
He values good seamen.

284
00:24:56,307 --> 00:24:58,138
You should ask his opinion.

285
00:24:58,627 --> 00:25:03,257
He commands his ship.
I command the household.

286
00:25:07,147 --> 00:25:10,105
You never know what the future
holds for a seaman, Emilios.

287
00:25:10,507 --> 00:25:13,738
I must ensure my daughter's security.

288
00:25:13,987 --> 00:25:16,945
A life without money
is a life without joy.

289
00:25:21,707 --> 00:25:23,265
Don't tell me...

290
00:25:24,787 --> 00:25:29,065
Don't tell me they have feelings
for each other!

291
00:25:30,347 --> 00:25:34,056
Don't tell me your charmer nephew
has mistaken my daughter...

292
00:25:34,387 --> 00:25:36,537
...for a harbor whore?

293
00:25:40,307 --> 00:25:42,184
We're adults now.

294
00:25:44,307 --> 00:25:47,265
We know the sorrows every house has.

295
00:25:59,507 --> 00:26:04,058
Mina... a heavy purse
isn't everything.

296
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:09,060
There are a lot of sacred things
involved. My hands are tied.

297
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:12,425
I owe a soul a debt of gratitude.

298
00:26:21,427 --> 00:26:22,064
And!

299
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:26,056
<i>Katina, Kiki, Moscha and Marie!</i>

300
00:26:26,427 --> 00:26:31,217
<i>The 4-member KKMM sorority!</i>

301
00:26:31,707 --> 00:26:36,019
<i>Katina, Kiki, Moscha, Marie...</i>

302
00:26:36,307 --> 00:26:39,060
<i>We'll be together for all eternity!</i>

303
00:26:40,227 --> 00:26:41,819
Here's a new one.

304
00:26:42,227 --> 00:26:46,664
<i>Oh Andros, my little island
in the sea...</i>

305
00:26:46,947 --> 00:26:50,576
<i>A musty, dismal prison
you are to me.</i>

306
00:26:50,987 --> 00:26:54,138
<i>Great and famous you'll never be.</i>

307
00:26:54,187 --> 00:26:57,179
<i>An empty fart for all eternity!</i>

308
00:26:58,747 --> 00:27:02,626
Such a tiny place and they went and
christened it "Little England"!

309
00:27:02,947 --> 00:27:06,337
"Little England" indeed! No relation
to the real England I'm sure.

310
00:27:06,547 --> 00:27:09,459
- Well there are a lot of boats!
- And two-bit snobs...

311
00:27:09,787 --> 00:27:13,177
...who put on lordly airs and
dream of riches and sea empires.

312
00:27:13,427 --> 00:27:15,987
But there are also
good-looking shipwrights.

313
00:27:16,227 --> 00:27:19,185
What are you supposed to do
with a shipwright? Frame him?

314
00:27:21,987 --> 00:27:25,263
Neither captain, nor engineer,
nor boatswain. Never!

315
00:27:25,507 --> 00:27:26,064
- Orsa!
- Where?

316
00:27:26,307 --> 00:27:29,185
- Over there!
- Not a word about David.

317
00:27:29,427 --> 00:27:31,622
Only you lot know about it and
Katerina, the embroiderer...

318
00:27:31,907 --> 00:27:34,057
...who won't breathe a word.
- Your sister?

319
00:27:34,107 --> 00:27:37,304
She doesn't let me in on her secrets,
I don't let her in on mine.

320
00:27:37,507 --> 00:27:40,340
She's always hiding behind the tulle
of her mosquito net...

321
00:27:40,507 --> 00:27:42,145
...or talking to herself
under the jasmine.

322
00:27:42,187 --> 00:27:44,985
My, my what's the matter
with Daddy's pet?

323
00:27:45,227 --> 00:27:47,183
- Jealous again?
- I get so furious!

324
00:27:47,467 --> 00:27:49,981
In every one of his letters
he writes.

325
00:27:50,267 --> 00:27:53,577
"Don't let Orsa have her hair cut".
It's always Orsa this and Orsa that.

326
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:04,979
<i>Spyros...</i>

327
00:28:07,067 --> 00:28:09,342
<i>... my dear boy.</i>

328
00:28:10,947 --> 00:28:15,498
<i>I don't have the heart
to upset you.</i>

329
00:28:17,587 --> 00:28:20,977
<i>But the news is not good.</i>

330
00:28:24,107 --> 00:28:27,224
<i>I failed to get
her mother to say "yes".</i>

331
00:28:30,387 --> 00:28:36,019
<i>Madame Mina is after wealth
and riches.</i>

332
00:28:38,507 --> 00:28:41,067
<i>Spyros, my lad...</i>

333
00:28:43,507 --> 00:28:48,376
<i>Her mother's reply was a curt "No".</i>

334
00:28:51,427 --> 00:28:55,306
<i>Our poverty is to blame.</i>

335
00:28:57,547 --> 00:29:02,462
<i>Clench your heart and don't let your
bitterness get the better of you.</i>

336
00:29:14,907 --> 00:29:16,704
Orsa!

337
00:29:17,147 --> 00:29:19,786
Did you see the Wassermann Test?
Stamped and certified.

338
00:29:19,987 --> 00:29:23,297
And he's ordered your bridal gown
from a Parisian fashion house!

339
00:29:23,547 --> 00:29:25,185
- He can give it to someone else!
- Generous! A gentleman.

340
00:29:25,227 --> 00:29:27,866
You're the lucky one and you don't
throw away such good fortune.

341
00:29:28,067 --> 00:29:29,386
When did you plan everything?

342
00:29:29,587 --> 00:29:31,100
First I investigated.
I thought of everything.

343
00:29:31,347 --> 00:29:32,826
- Except for one thing!
- What?

344
00:29:33,027 --> 00:29:34,540
Why did you say "yes"
without asking me?

345
00:29:34,827 --> 00:29:36,101
I know what I'm doing.

346
00:29:36,147 --> 00:29:38,217
What if I have feelings
for someone else?

347
00:29:38,507 --> 00:29:40,418
Do you?

348
00:29:45,387 --> 00:29:47,059
What am I to you?

349
00:29:49,107 --> 00:29:53,623
A field... to be sold
on St Savvas Day?

350
00:29:54,387 --> 00:29:57,220
It's all settled.
We're not going to lose face.

351
00:30:06,107 --> 00:30:08,143
You're hard...

352
00:30:10,307 --> 00:30:12,457
...as hard as stone.

353
00:30:23,307 --> 00:30:24,979
Come on, my boy.

354
00:30:28,307 --> 00:30:30,775
I'd watch her from a distance.

355
00:30:32,307 --> 00:30:34,025
She hesitated...

356
00:30:35,107 --> 00:30:38,656
- I thought she'd refuse because of...
- Hush!

357
00:30:41,307 --> 00:30:44,822
Here, here!
Here's where you should live.

358
00:30:45,987 --> 00:30:47,500
It will happen eventually.

359
00:30:48,587 --> 00:30:51,340
For now it's whatever Orsa wants.

360
00:30:51,707 --> 00:30:54,301
I'll wait on your lady all day.

361
00:30:54,667 --> 00:30:57,227
But at night I'll come back here.

362
00:30:57,267 --> 00:30:59,986
I want my own walls.

363
00:31:07,267 --> 00:31:08,859
Congratulations!

364
00:31:11,227 --> 00:31:14,458
May you live to a ripe old age,
healthy and in love!

365
00:31:16,707 --> 00:31:18,777
And to our little Moschoula's.

366
00:31:32,147 --> 00:31:34,058
What an aristocratic bridegroom!

367
00:31:45,467 --> 00:31:47,662
Hexadaktylou!
Start playing.

368
00:32:11,907 --> 00:32:14,546
David Bradley, English teacher.

369
00:33:18,827 --> 00:33:22,786
If only my son were here,
he would be so proud of you!

370
00:33:26,787 --> 00:33:29,221
Well, he's not here...

371
00:33:32,227 --> 00:33:33,945
Granny...

372
00:33:34,307 --> 00:33:36,377
Ah, the sea...

373
00:35:12,347 --> 00:35:17,182
<i>Andros, 27 December 1930.</i>

374
00:35:19,947 --> 00:35:22,825
<i>It's better you weren't here, Daddy.</i>

375
00:35:23,227 --> 00:35:26,185
<i>The island was covered with
a blanket of snow...</i>

376
00:35:26,947 --> 00:35:32,544
<i>... and it looked aristocratic and rare
like the postcards you sent us...</i>

377
00:35:34,147 --> 00:35:36,456
<i>... from frozen Archangel.</i>

378
00:35:51,147 --> 00:35:52,216
Congratulations!

379
00:35:52,507 --> 00:35:54,498
May it be your turn next, girls!

380
00:36:56,787 --> 00:36:59,585
It's much better for women...

381
00:37:01,307 --> 00:37:04,140
...not to marry the man they love...

382
00:37:07,707 --> 00:37:10,938
...because then when he starts
straying...

383
00:37:12,227 --> 00:37:17,506
...the pain won't be so great.

384
00:37:37,867 --> 00:37:40,461
Don't touch me tonight.

385
00:38:01,427 --> 00:38:04,544
May it be our turn soon, the seven
unmarried men aboard the ship.

386
00:38:06,347 --> 00:38:09,066
- From your sister's wedding?
- My godmother, Annezio, sent them.

387
00:38:09,267 --> 00:38:11,178
From the wedding of her master
Nikos Vatokouzis.

388
00:38:11,387 --> 00:38:13,947
- Who did he marry?
- Orsa Saltaferou.

389
00:38:14,347 --> 00:38:16,542
He's covered her with gold.

390
00:38:59,427 --> 00:39:02,544
You were going to walk around
the Maltabes Circle...

391
00:39:02,787 --> 00:39:04,379
Liar!

392
00:39:38,307 --> 00:39:40,537
An unlucky house...

393
00:39:43,227 --> 00:39:45,787
It brought sorrow...

394
00:39:47,947 --> 00:39:50,302
You'll banish it, Orsa.

395
00:39:51,827 --> 00:39:53,306
How?

396
00:40:02,267 --> 00:40:05,657
The old shadows persist...
I can feel them.

397
00:40:18,027 --> 00:40:23,021
She built the other house for us.
If I leave now she'll be furious.

398
00:40:25,427 --> 00:40:29,022
Maybe later, when Moscha
gets married too.

399
00:40:32,307 --> 00:40:34,901
You can't live without your Mama.

400
00:42:07,227 --> 00:42:11,140
<i>Saint Basil is on his way...</i>

401
00:42:11,547 --> 00:42:14,345
<i>... from Caesarea.</i>

402
00:42:14,787 --> 00:42:18,939
<i>Bearing incense and a candle...</i>

403
00:42:19,387 --> 00:42:22,902
<i>... paper and pen.</i>

404
00:42:23,067 --> 00:42:25,979
<i>The pen wrote and the paper...</i>

405
00:42:26,027 --> 00:42:28,143
Mina...

406
00:42:28,867 --> 00:42:32,746
...in China, in Japan,
in Manchuria...

407
00:42:33,307 --> 00:42:36,777
...we have revolutions.

408
00:42:38,267 --> 00:42:40,542
The ports there are dangerous.

409
00:42:42,307 --> 00:42:46,744
Your Savvas himself requested it both
from my son in London and myself.

410
00:42:47,067 --> 00:42:52,346
He wants to work only in the Atlantic
a quiet trade, you know...

411
00:42:53,787 --> 00:42:57,939
Curacao, Paramaribo, Necochea,
Suerte and back.

412
00:43:00,827 --> 00:43:03,295
My late husband taught me well.

413
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:07,426
Even admitted
I was sharper than him.

414
00:43:10,667 --> 00:43:15,457
- So, Savvas...
- I'm here about Moscha.

415
00:43:16,107 --> 00:43:17,506
Moscha?

416
00:43:27,307 --> 00:43:29,298
- David.
- David.

417
00:43:31,227 --> 00:43:34,060
I found it in the hatbox
where she keeps her combs.

418
00:43:34,627 --> 00:43:39,257
<i>Good evening to you my lords,
here to celebrate...</i>

419
00:43:39,307 --> 00:43:44,461
I brought him here as an act of
charity for the seamen's children.

420
00:43:44,907 --> 00:43:47,023
So that they learn fluent English.

421
00:43:47,307 --> 00:43:52,700
And he is penniless...

422
00:43:54,507 --> 00:43:56,577
...hungry...

423
00:43:57,067 --> 00:44:00,980
...with sickly ribs you can see
through his shirt.

424
00:44:02,547 --> 00:44:07,541
He's someone who paints bulls,
graves, carcasses...

425
00:44:09,227 --> 00:44:11,058
...the wounded seal...

426
00:44:11,907 --> 00:44:16,139
...who tries to turn the heads
of silly schoolgirls, the pervert!

427
00:44:18,307 --> 00:44:21,265
Who dares to look
at the women here!

428
00:44:21,587 --> 00:44:23,464
- David?
- David.

429
00:44:26,187 --> 00:44:29,065
You have the means.
Send him packing.

430
00:44:35,427 --> 00:44:39,466
- I'll bring another Englishman.
- Bring an Englishwoman.

431
00:44:46,387 --> 00:44:48,264
See that you find her a husband.

432
00:44:50,307 --> 00:44:52,821
You sent him away! You!

433
00:44:54,427 --> 00:44:56,497
I did what I had to do.

434
00:44:57,267 --> 00:45:01,180
You didn't think I was going to let
you starve with him in the fog.

435
00:45:01,507 --> 00:45:03,737
Haven't you ever been in love?

436
00:45:04,267 --> 00:45:06,337
Is that what you think?

437
00:45:09,107 --> 00:45:13,419
Well I've been hurt too.
I've been hurt and I know.

438
00:45:13,747 --> 00:45:15,544
That's the way life is.

439
00:45:15,787 --> 00:45:19,223
Love doesn't last long
but the pain it brings does...

440
00:45:20,907 --> 00:45:22,898
At least give me back
his photograph.

441
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:26,099
You think I have it? What would I do
with it? Look at his stupid face...

442
00:45:26,347 --> 00:45:27,666
The penniless, starving
good-for-nothing!

443
00:45:27,907 --> 00:45:29,056
You stole it!

444
00:45:29,267 --> 00:45:31,303
<i>It's all your fault!</i>

445
00:45:32,587 --> 00:45:34,896
<i>It's London you wanted so badly...</i>

446
00:45:35,827 --> 00:45:38,500
<i>Mama, I hate you!</i>

447
00:45:38,827 --> 00:45:42,103
<i>I don't want your house or you.
I'm getting out of here.</i>

448
00:45:42,387 --> 00:45:44,059
Poor Moscha...

449
00:45:44,307 --> 00:45:45,183
<i>You're heartless!</i>

450
00:45:46,787 --> 00:45:48,425
Insensitive!

451
00:45:49,427 --> 00:45:50,223
A viper!

452
00:46:18,947 --> 00:46:21,063
From our offices in Piraeus.

453
00:46:23,107 --> 00:46:24,256
A charter-party?

454
00:46:26,067 --> 00:46:27,022
A boy.

455
00:46:33,027 --> 00:46:35,495
Congratulations, Captain Nikos.

456
00:46:38,547 --> 00:46:41,220
Congratulations, Captain Nikos.
We'll be drinking beer today.

457
00:46:42,187 --> 00:46:43,825
Congratulations.

458
00:47:04,507 --> 00:47:08,420
Iron deficiency due to breast-
feeding anorexia, insomnia.

459
00:47:08,827 --> 00:47:13,059
These things happen, but you did
well to bring her to Athens.

460
00:47:13,107 --> 00:47:15,905
We have more means at our disposal.

461
00:47:16,267 --> 00:47:19,100
In a month our fair lady
will be as right as rain.

462
00:47:23,227 --> 00:47:25,741
<i>Creams and rice puddings.
Delivery.</i>

463
00:47:29,307 --> 00:47:31,025
Stefanos got a car.

464
00:47:31,307 --> 00:47:34,060
<i>As soon as he got his driver's
license, he bought a car.</i>

465
00:47:34,107 --> 00:47:36,382
<i>You look just fine, Philip...</i>

466
00:47:36,747 --> 00:47:38,863
<i>Next week he's taking us
all to Phaliron.</i>

467
00:47:39,107 --> 00:47:40,096
I'm sorry.

468
00:47:42,347 --> 00:47:45,066
For five whole months
she breastfed the baby...

469
00:47:45,107 --> 00:47:48,543
...and she fainted while rubbing
her heels with a pumice stone.

470
00:47:52,347 --> 00:47:54,542
<i>Please collect the thermometers.</i>

471
00:47:56,147 --> 00:47:58,661
Our baby's in good hands.

472
00:47:59,027 --> 00:48:03,225
Moscha is crazy about our young
Savvas. She writes us every day.

473
00:48:03,507 --> 00:48:06,260
What she fed him, where
she took him for a walk...

474
00:48:06,507 --> 00:48:08,179
...what she sang to him.
You get the photographs.

475
00:48:15,507 --> 00:48:16,701
I'm sorry.

476
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:22,217
I'm the one who's sorry.

477
00:48:24,347 --> 00:48:28,306
I've just come for the day.
I can't escort you to Andros.

478
00:48:30,947 --> 00:48:34,064
Problems. Damage to a ship's
structure under the waterline.

479
00:48:34,307 --> 00:48:36,218
But I won't bother you
with such things.

480
00:48:40,107 --> 00:48:43,463
Let's see when I'll be able to hold
our son tightly in my arms.

481
00:48:54,467 --> 00:48:56,139
<i>I've missed Andros.</i>

482
00:48:57,147 --> 00:49:01,425
<i>I miss my son like crazy,
and the island.</i>

483
00:49:18,787 --> 00:49:23,383
<i>Welcome to our Andros!
Get your luggage and make room...</i>

484
00:49:23,787 --> 00:49:26,426
<i>... to those who are getting ready
to depart.</i>

485
00:49:26,747 --> 00:49:31,059
<i>People of Andros, get your
ticket and bon voyage!</i>

486
00:49:51,427 --> 00:49:57,582
My love, my Savvas, my child!
My beauty!

487
00:49:58,467 --> 00:50:00,025
Everything will be alright...

488
00:50:00,067 --> 00:50:02,262
Where's your Daddy, Savvas?

489
00:50:03,387 --> 00:50:05,855
Where's your Daddy, sweetheart?

490
00:50:06,107 --> 00:50:09,224
You're all right. You're fine.
You have your color back.

491
00:50:10,427 --> 00:50:13,783
May you always be in the best
of health, Mrs. Vatokouzi.

492
00:50:14,547 --> 00:50:16,936
- Where's Moscha?
- They're coming.

493
00:50:18,587 --> 00:50:20,066
Who's coming?

494
00:50:20,107 --> 00:50:22,701
Moscha and her fiancé.

495
00:50:22,987 --> 00:50:26,059
Her fiancé?
When did she get engaged?

496
00:50:26,107 --> 00:50:28,860
The day before yesterday. We had
no time to write to you about it.

497
00:50:29,107 --> 00:50:31,416
- Who's she engaged to?
- A captain.

498
00:50:33,027 --> 00:50:38,465
<i>The ship for Tinos, Syros, Piraeus
sails in an hour! Hurry!</i>

499
00:50:41,827 --> 00:50:42,976
Orsa!

500
00:51:13,227 --> 00:51:15,218
My ring...

501
00:51:20,587 --> 00:51:22,942
He asked for my hand ten days ago.

502
00:51:23,307 --> 00:51:27,095
"I'm a captain now and I make
that much", he told the shrew.

503
00:51:27,147 --> 00:51:32,221
The Hadoulideses gave him
a 15% share in a new steamship.

504
00:51:32,267 --> 00:51:35,304
Because it seems he saved some
expensive cargo for them...

505
00:51:35,507 --> 00:51:36,656
...from tornadoes...

506
00:51:37,227 --> 00:51:41,220
He put almost two kilos
of gold earrings and bracelets...

507
00:51:41,507 --> 00:51:44,305
...on the table in front of her.
For little Moscha, he said.

508
00:51:44,547 --> 00:51:47,380
- In other words, for me.
- I know you're little Moscha.

509
00:51:50,507 --> 00:51:52,145
What did Mama say?

510
00:51:53,067 --> 00:51:55,137
Did she say yes right away?

511
00:51:57,227 --> 00:51:58,501
Of course.

512
00:52:00,507 --> 00:52:04,261
She was scared I might elope
with some foreigner, you see.

513
00:52:07,587 --> 00:52:13,184
Orsa, with Spyros, I forgot that
dreadful Englishman in no time!

514
00:52:13,587 --> 00:52:17,262
Erased him from memory.

515
00:52:18,427 --> 00:52:22,545
Taking off without even
a "goodbye little Moscha"!

516
00:52:23,267 --> 00:52:27,658
Did he send Emilios
to arrange the match?

517
00:52:27,947 --> 00:52:30,017
Spyros himself came!

518
00:52:36,347 --> 00:52:38,144
In other words... he loves you?

519
00:52:38,507 --> 00:52:39,417
What else?

520
00:52:40,427 --> 00:52:43,658
- Do you love him too?
- He deserves to be loved!

521
00:52:45,667 --> 00:52:47,578
Isn't he gorgeous?

522
00:52:48,027 --> 00:52:51,303
Have you noticed his eyes?
They sparkle so!

523
00:52:51,667 --> 00:52:55,342
All the girls are jealous of me.
They even came up with some lyrics.

524
00:52:55,587 --> 00:52:59,660
Moscha, little Moscha, a thousand
beauty marks on your back so white...

525
00:52:59,867 --> 00:53:03,303
...for Maltabes to kiss all night.

526
00:53:04,107 --> 00:53:06,257
And my God...

527
00:53:06,947 --> 00:53:09,063
...how he kisses!

528
00:53:16,707 --> 00:53:18,459
Orsa...

529
00:53:24,387 --> 00:53:27,379
You love Nikos, right?

530
00:53:27,707 --> 00:53:29,663
He's a good man.

531
00:53:30,147 --> 00:53:35,301
That's not what I asked.
I asked if you love him.

532
00:53:37,147 --> 00:53:38,626
He's my husband.

533
00:53:39,027 --> 00:53:42,940
With the most amazing hands
in the world!

534
00:53:43,187 --> 00:53:44,620
Can't stop looking at them...

535
00:53:44,827 --> 00:53:47,387
Large and small veins
like rivers and streams...

536
00:53:47,667 --> 00:53:51,216
Like a map of... Rio de la Plata!

537
00:53:51,627 --> 00:53:54,061
- My brother-in-law, after Spyros...
- Moscha!

538
00:53:55,107 --> 00:53:57,177
We're late.

539
00:53:57,547 --> 00:54:00,015
We're off to book the dulcimer
and lute players.

540
00:54:00,347 --> 00:54:01,541
I'm getting married.

541
00:55:01,747 --> 00:55:05,057
Moscha and the scent of cinnamon.
A girl fit for a King!

542
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:06,826
Little Moscha!

543
00:55:41,147 --> 00:55:42,660
Your health, Moscha.

544
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:26,663
Long live the bride and groom.

545
00:56:28,987 --> 00:56:30,579
A solid marriage.

546
00:56:33,307 --> 00:56:34,820
Come on, Captain.

547
00:56:40,347 --> 00:56:42,338
Congratulations. Congratulations!

548
00:56:46,307 --> 00:56:47,820
May you have fine offspring!

549
00:56:48,147 --> 00:56:49,978
Next dance, let's go!

550
00:56:50,027 --> 00:56:52,336
Captain's wives, my daughters!

551
00:57:05,667 --> 00:57:08,022
- And dessert.
- Lovely! May your turn be next.

552
00:57:08,267 --> 00:57:09,859
Thank you very much.

553
00:57:10,107 --> 00:57:11,426
Yours too, sweetie.

554
00:57:15,187 --> 00:57:17,655
Come on, Uncle Emilios, cheer up!

555
00:57:22,307 --> 00:57:23,786
For your little Moscha.

556
00:57:34,027 --> 00:57:37,815
I had eleven dances with him.
And you, not a single one.

557
00:57:38,067 --> 00:57:40,137
What will he think? You're acting
as though you can't stand him.

558
00:57:40,387 --> 00:57:41,137
- Me?
- No, me!

559
00:58:31,587 --> 00:58:33,066
<i>My little Moscha!</i>

560
00:58:33,467 --> 00:58:35,378
<i>Aye aye, Captain.</i>

561
00:58:42,427 --> 00:58:43,940
<i>You're drunk, eh?</i>

562
00:58:44,147 --> 00:58:46,263
<i>Your kisses made me drunk.</i>

563
00:58:46,547 --> 00:58:49,380
<i>I want more and more
until the morning.</i>

564
00:58:53,027 --> 00:58:56,144
<i>No! Leave the windows open!</i>

565
00:58:58,587 --> 00:59:02,546
<i>For as long as I'm here,
I want to breathe in the Aegean.</i>

566
00:59:17,787 --> 00:59:21,575
Single plank flooring.
24 single cypress boards...

567
00:59:21,827 --> 00:59:25,137
...no mud between them to drown
out the sound of footsteps...

568
00:59:25,387 --> 00:59:27,855
...and the noise
of everyday housework.

569
00:59:28,227 --> 00:59:31,378
Your mother spent money
on fancy doorknobs, fancy tiles...

570
00:59:31,747 --> 00:59:35,023
...fancy balcony railings,
but scrimped on the ceiling.

571
00:59:35,307 --> 00:59:37,218
Let's fix it.

572
00:59:38,267 --> 00:59:42,055
Now that we can afford it,
Mr. Halas.

573
00:59:42,427 --> 00:59:44,987
But how? Tear up the whole house?

574
00:59:45,347 --> 00:59:47,542
No matter how much you pay me...

575
00:59:47,867 --> 00:59:51,416
...single boards don't become
double boards.

576
01:00:48,267 --> 01:00:52,419
Good-for-nothing carpenter.
Murderer...

577
01:00:59,467 --> 01:01:05,064
In Andros mattresses are only
dented on one side... the woman's.

578
01:01:06,147 --> 01:01:08,342
They come and go like visitors.

579
01:01:08,707 --> 01:01:13,417
When Artemis comes it's as though
my whole schedule is disrupted.

580
01:01:13,467 --> 01:01:16,425
The children are very shy with him.

581
01:01:17,067 --> 01:01:20,537
He's a stranger in his own house.

582
01:01:21,107 --> 01:01:26,306
Say, Mina. It looks as if Savvas has
forgotten the way back to Andros...

583
01:01:26,347 --> 01:01:29,259
Something, something
must have happened.

584
01:01:30,427 --> 01:01:33,385
What happened is that
which happens to all of us.

585
01:01:34,707 --> 01:01:36,538
Married almost 30 years...

586
01:01:36,947 --> 01:01:39,984
...and I still haven't worn out
a pair of sheets with him.

587
01:01:41,307 --> 01:01:44,538
Your daughters, your grandson...
they are all well?

588
01:01:44,827 --> 01:01:47,136
Moscha will be giving birth
any time now.

589
01:01:47,507 --> 01:01:49,179
And your sons-in-law,
they are well too?

590
01:01:49,227 --> 01:01:51,457
One left, the other's coming.

591
01:01:52,787 --> 01:01:54,505
Hello Savvas.

592
01:01:56,307 --> 01:01:57,057
Look...

593
01:01:59,427 --> 01:02:01,463
Savvas, it's your Daddy!

594
01:02:03,707 --> 01:02:06,221
It's your Daddy!
It's true!

595
01:02:07,387 --> 01:02:09,537
Wind it up.

596
01:02:12,107 --> 01:02:14,223
Can you wind it up?
Shall I show you how?

597
01:02:14,427 --> 01:02:15,143
Go away!

598
01:02:15,347 --> 01:02:17,144
- Savvas!
- Take it easy.

599
01:02:20,027 --> 01:02:22,336
Shall I give you a kiss?

600
01:02:23,027 --> 01:02:25,416
Will you give me a kiss
now I showed you?

601
01:03:05,067 --> 01:03:07,297
It was washed up by the sea.

602
01:03:10,267 --> 01:03:12,622
You're the gift of my life.

603
01:03:42,947 --> 01:03:47,020
How about it? Shall we move?

604
01:03:49,747 --> 01:03:53,057
You must have gotten over
your old fear by now...

605
01:03:56,147 --> 01:03:58,217
Why not your mother here...

606
01:03:58,467 --> 01:04:01,584
...and we move to the other house?
We'll be by ourselves.

607
01:04:05,947 --> 01:04:09,178
Not by ourselves... by myself...

608
01:04:13,147 --> 01:04:15,058
...in those rooms...

609
01:04:17,187 --> 01:04:18,620
...by myself.

610
01:04:21,827 --> 01:04:24,295
Between those walls that...

611
01:04:37,187 --> 01:04:39,257
...by myself...

612
01:04:43,347 --> 01:04:45,463
...since you men are always away.

613
01:04:54,347 --> 01:04:59,819
<i>Yokohama, Japan, 12 March 1937.</i>

614
01:05:01,227 --> 01:05:03,582
<i>My dearest Moscha.</i>

615
01:05:04,107 --> 01:05:07,656
<i>Our household is constantly
on my mind. Are you all well?</i>

616
01:05:08,707 --> 01:05:10,777
<i>Before I open each one
of your letters...</i>

617
01:05:11,067 --> 01:05:13,137
<i>... just to be on the safe side,
I make the sign of the cross.</i>

618
01:05:13,187 --> 01:05:17,339
<i>I hope both you and your sister
loved the exotic kimonos.</i>

619
01:05:22,227 --> 01:05:24,297
I don't think Spyros...

620
01:05:25,627 --> 01:05:28,187
...cheats on me
with Japanese women.

621
01:05:28,387 --> 01:05:31,220
With Polish women, Englishwomen.
I rule it out.

622
01:05:31,827 --> 01:05:36,343
When he comes home he has such
longing for a female body... for me.

623
01:05:39,427 --> 01:05:43,181
He undresses me and takes me in his
arms and kisses me and squeezes me...

624
01:05:43,587 --> 01:05:48,945
...on the lips, my breasts,
my legs... with such passion...

625
01:05:51,187 --> 01:05:53,178
...such passion.

626
01:05:54,107 --> 01:05:56,143
He can't get enough of me.

627
01:06:07,987 --> 01:06:09,102
It's freezing!

628
01:06:23,387 --> 01:06:25,503
You're burning up with fever.

629
01:07:21,867 --> 01:07:25,303
Spyros and Moscha, Miltos-Marie.

630
01:07:26,027 --> 01:07:29,303
Louis-Katina, Giannis-Kiki.

631
01:07:30,147 --> 01:07:32,183
From my tangerine tree.

632
01:07:38,227 --> 01:07:40,024
It's their photographs we married.

633
01:07:40,307 --> 01:07:43,777
And they, ours.
Time goes by with photographs.

634
01:07:45,467 --> 01:07:50,587
1932, a memento from the christening
of Savvas junior.

635
01:07:51,267 --> 01:07:56,295
1934, our Christina in the baptismal
font at the church of Aghios Giorgis.

636
01:07:57,347 --> 01:07:59,224
1934...

637
01:07:59,267 --> 01:08:05,456
...a memento naturally from the
1st birthday of your niece Mersina.

638
01:08:06,387 --> 01:08:09,060
A letter dated the day
before yesterday.

639
01:08:09,267 --> 01:08:12,100
"My dearest Spyros, our Christina.

640
01:08:13,347 --> 01:08:15,941
A little doll with her doll.

641
01:08:16,387 --> 01:08:21,063
Our daughter adores unripe damsons
and, like you, meatballs..."

642
01:08:23,267 --> 01:08:25,576
But how would he know about it?

643
01:08:44,827 --> 01:08:50,459
<i>Today you say goodbye to me
and to Argentina.</i>

644
01:08:59,267 --> 01:09:00,666
<i>That was it...</i>

645
01:09:04,427 --> 01:09:06,895
<i>I entered like a thief...</i>

646
01:09:07,227 --> 01:09:08,137
<i>... for two hours...</i>

647
01:09:10,187 --> 01:09:11,700
<i>... that was it...</i>

648
01:09:22,067 --> 01:09:25,423
<i>So that the child remembers them.</i>

649
01:09:30,987 --> 01:09:34,582
<i>He's riding round the port
on his bicycle.</i>

650
01:09:35,107 --> 01:09:38,019
He didn't want you to kiss him
for the last time.

651
01:09:38,067 --> 01:09:40,376
That's life Angelita.

652
01:09:43,507 --> 01:09:47,546
- That's life.
- That's life. I understand.

653
01:09:48,827 --> 01:09:50,818
<i>You must go back home.</i>

654
01:09:51,027 --> 01:09:52,460
<i>I must.</i>

655
01:09:52,787 --> 01:09:55,779
<i>It looks as if war will break out.</i>

656
01:09:57,147 --> 01:10:00,378
<i>Your shirts. Your things.</i>

657
01:10:00,987 --> 01:10:03,376
<i>Everything you had in the house.</i>

658
01:10:08,027 --> 01:10:10,860
<i>Now that they saw me on the ship...</i>

659
01:10:11,107 --> 01:10:14,224
<i>... tongues will wag anyway...</i>

660
01:10:18,427 --> 01:10:20,418
<i>I want you to stay here.</i>

661
01:10:20,667 --> 01:10:22,623
<i>I want to leave alone...</i>

662
01:10:22,947 --> 01:10:26,906
<i>... and count the steps
as I go down...</i>

663
01:10:30,187 --> 01:10:31,586
<i>Angelita...</i>

664
01:10:43,187 --> 01:10:44,540
<i>The keys.</i>

665
01:10:48,467 --> 01:10:50,423
<i>You're not coming back.</i>

666
01:10:51,307 --> 01:10:54,504
<i>You're not coming back
to our house.</i>

667
01:10:57,067 --> 01:10:59,456
<i>It's yours.</i>

668
01:11:00,067 --> 01:11:01,898
<i>The house is yours.</i>

669
01:11:04,547 --> 01:11:06,139
<i>The deed.</i>

670
01:11:07,307 --> 01:11:11,061
<i>They brought it to me
late yesterday.</i>

671
01:11:20,907 --> 01:11:24,377
<i>You've also grown old
with me, my dear.</i>

672
01:11:25,547 --> 01:11:27,344
It was nice.

673
01:11:34,107 --> 01:11:35,586
It was nice.

674
01:12:02,307 --> 01:12:03,786
Turn up the volume!

675
01:12:04,147 --> 01:12:05,944
So the people opposite
can hear too!

676
01:12:12,907 --> 01:12:14,226
Orsa!

677
01:12:15,427 --> 01:12:17,224
Come upstairs quickly!
Spyros is here!

678
01:12:20,107 --> 01:12:22,223
My little Christina!

679
01:12:31,707 --> 01:12:33,618
The money's adding up.

680
01:12:36,147 --> 01:12:37,705
For the big step.

681
01:12:38,787 --> 01:12:40,539
What sort of step?

682
01:12:44,307 --> 01:12:46,184
Step by step with my girlfriends.

683
01:12:47,947 --> 01:12:50,222
The bountiful seas!

684
01:12:52,227 --> 01:12:56,505
You mean a house in Athens?
In Piraeus?

685
01:13:13,147 --> 01:13:14,785
Hello, sister-in-law.

686
01:13:21,427 --> 01:13:22,701
It's 10 o'clock.

687
01:13:23,467 --> 01:13:26,140
Time for bed!
That's all I care about.

688
01:13:32,387 --> 01:13:34,059
Will you stop it!

689
01:13:36,387 --> 01:13:38,264
Go to bed!

690
01:13:38,307 --> 01:13:39,786
At once!

691
01:13:47,107 --> 01:13:49,098
That's more like it.

692
01:14:16,427 --> 01:14:17,655
<i>Andros, with your jasmine...</i>

693
01:14:17,907 --> 01:14:19,784
<i>... I wouldn't change you
for anything.</i>

694
01:14:20,027 --> 01:14:23,258
<i>Yes, but you'll be leaving again.
You like the high seas, Captain.</i>

695
01:14:30,547 --> 01:14:32,503
Your words.

696
01:15:10,627 --> 01:15:12,185
<i>A fire in red...</i>

697
01:15:12,227 --> 01:15:14,218
A fire in red!

698
01:15:14,667 --> 01:15:16,339
<i>A fire in red!</i>

699
01:15:20,947 --> 01:15:23,222
A fire in red.

700
01:15:24,347 --> 01:15:26,736
<i>I had it sewn for you...
for you...</i>

701
01:15:27,507 --> 01:15:29,020
<i>I had it sewn for you.</i>

702
01:15:29,347 --> 01:15:31,303
I had it sewn for you.

703
01:16:11,747 --> 01:16:13,783
I stay awake all night
and I don't breathe.

704
01:16:13,987 --> 01:16:16,296
I stay awake all night
and I don't breathe...

705
01:16:39,307 --> 01:16:41,184
<i>My girl! My girl!</i>

706
01:16:41,427 --> 01:16:43,179
<i>Wipe her forehead. She's
drenched in perspiration.</i>

707
01:16:43,227 --> 01:16:45,058
<i>Push, Orsa, sweetheart.
Come on, be patient.</i>

708
01:16:45,307 --> 01:16:47,423
<i>The water's ready.
I'm going to boil some more.</i>

709
01:16:47,707 --> 01:16:49,937
<i>- Midwife, give us a hand.
- Annezio, boil the cloths.</i>

710
01:16:50,267 --> 01:16:53,816
<i>Mersina, go to your godmother.
Christina! Go play with her.</i>

711
01:16:54,227 --> 01:16:55,421
<i>I need four towels.</i>

712
01:16:55,707 --> 01:16:57,459
<i>The water's ready.
I'm boiling more.</i>

713
01:16:59,067 --> 01:17:01,535
<i>Come on, Orsa! You've done
this before, my girl.</i>

714
01:17:01,787 --> 01:17:03,664
<i>Wipe her brow. She's sweating.</i>

715
01:17:03,947 --> 01:17:05,983
<i>Come on, girl.
You've had another two.</i>

716
01:17:06,267 --> 01:17:07,746
<i>Push, sweetheart. Push!</i>

717
01:17:07,987 --> 01:17:10,865
<i>Everything will be all right.</i>

718
01:17:11,187 --> 01:17:13,143
<i>Squeeze my hand.
As much as you like.</i>

719
01:17:13,387 --> 01:17:14,706
<i>The Virgin Mary is with us.</i>

720
01:17:14,947 --> 01:17:16,539
<i>With pain. With pain!</i>

721
01:17:16,787 --> 01:17:19,062
<i>What is it, baby?
What is it? A girl!</i>

722
01:17:19,467 --> 01:17:21,776
<i>A girl. Another girl!</i>

723
01:17:22,787 --> 01:17:25,699
<i>A little girl. A little girl.</i>

724
01:17:26,027 --> 01:17:28,985
<i>The good mother's child
is a girl!</i>

725
01:17:29,027 --> 01:17:32,463
<i>Well done, little Orsa!</i>

726
01:18:00,227 --> 01:18:03,583
<i>Spyros, send Nikos a telegram
with the good news!</i>

727
01:18:11,747 --> 01:18:16,775
<i>Nikos, dear Orsa
has borne a daughter.</i>

728
01:18:18,867 --> 01:18:22,064
<i>Mother and child
are in the best of health.</i>

729
01:18:23,907 --> 01:18:25,818
<i>Heartfelt congratulations.</i>

730
01:18:31,067 --> 01:18:34,264
<i>Nikos, congratulations
on the birth of your daughter.</i>

731
01:18:34,587 --> 01:18:36,066
<i>Mother and child are well.</i>

732
01:18:37,267 --> 01:18:40,065
<i>You've become a father
for the third time.</i>

733
01:18:40,427 --> 01:18:42,577
<i>I envy you.</i>

734
01:18:48,547 --> 01:18:51,459
<i>Nikos, beautiful little Orsa
has had a third child.</i>

735
01:18:52,387 --> 01:18:55,299
<i>Her eyes like black pearls.</i>

736
01:18:55,707 --> 01:19:00,178
<i>And her hair, which was not
been cut since her schooldays...</i>

737
01:19:00,547 --> 01:19:04,142
<i>... flows in waves
over the entire double bed.</i>

738
01:19:18,147 --> 01:19:23,744
<i>Is the prize for fidelity
worth a single penny, I wonder?</i>

739
01:19:27,507 --> 01:19:29,065
<i>All these years...</i>

740
01:19:32,267 --> 01:19:35,145
<i>All these years alone
and faithful...</i>

741
01:19:36,467 --> 01:19:38,742
<i>What's the prize?</i>

742
01:19:41,027 --> 01:19:43,177
<i>What?</i>

743
01:19:43,587 --> 01:19:45,225
<i>Ah, Mina, Mina...</i>

744
01:19:55,227 --> 01:19:57,263
A whole bunch of grandchildren!

745
01:20:20,027 --> 01:20:22,097
Woman!

746
01:20:28,747 --> 01:20:30,738
I'm back to Andros.

747
01:21:07,227 --> 01:21:08,865
They're here at last!

748
01:21:30,067 --> 01:21:31,864
Nothing more.

749
01:21:32,267 --> 01:21:37,057
Britain and France
have declared war on Germany.

750
01:21:40,267 --> 01:21:42,542
Your husband arrived just in time,
Mina.

751
01:21:42,747 --> 01:21:44,817
He's lucky he managed...

752
01:21:49,147 --> 01:21:53,345
<i>How did Mrs. Hadoulaina put it?
England... what exactly did she say?</i>

753
01:21:54,147 --> 01:21:57,378
Captain Savvas, here's your
other son-in-law, Spyros.

754
01:21:58,867 --> 01:22:00,539
Good to see you.

755
01:22:02,387 --> 01:22:04,298
And yet, you're late...

756
01:22:06,147 --> 01:22:08,422
You're too late.

757
01:22:16,587 --> 01:22:19,021
Your mug.
It's been waiting for you.

758
01:22:30,467 --> 01:22:33,300
You've settled in nicely on
dry land son, isn't that so?

759
01:22:36,347 --> 01:22:39,498
And you must be proud
of the house Mina built.

760
01:22:44,547 --> 01:22:47,015
The agony of separation is over.

761
01:22:50,227 --> 01:22:53,378
Be mindful... even now.

762
01:22:58,107 --> 01:23:01,986
The two Orsas in my life,
my mother and my daughter...

763
01:23:03,027 --> 01:23:04,824
...they make the best coffee.

764
01:23:07,267 --> 01:23:09,906
It's the loneliness that calls
for a pot of coffee.

765
01:23:11,587 --> 01:23:13,066
The loneliness...

766
01:23:45,267 --> 01:23:46,825
I want us to live here.

767
01:23:54,907 --> 01:23:58,343
I thought you brought me here
to pick up some things.

768
01:23:59,267 --> 01:24:01,337
For Christ's sake,
I don't understand you, Orsa.

769
01:24:01,667 --> 01:24:03,339
Weren't you the one who said...

770
01:24:03,587 --> 01:24:05,066
...the walls were steeped
in my father's madness...

771
01:24:05,107 --> 01:24:07,098
...and my mother's tears?

772
01:24:08,027 --> 01:24:09,938
And you said that I...

773
01:24:13,227 --> 01:24:16,185
...that I would breathe new life
into the rooms...

774
01:24:16,387 --> 01:24:19,424
I begged you, Orsa. I begged
and begged but you insisted...

775
01:24:19,627 --> 01:24:22,016
...that you want the cousins
to be together.

776
01:24:22,067 --> 01:24:24,297
That you want to be
near your sister.

777
01:24:24,507 --> 01:24:25,496
I'll have Annezio.

778
01:24:25,707 --> 01:24:27,379
She's over 70.

779
01:24:29,627 --> 01:24:31,106
What's going on?

780
01:24:38,267 --> 01:24:41,384
I feel that we should.
That it's necessary.

781
01:24:44,187 --> 01:24:47,224
That the time has come
for us to move here.

782
01:24:47,587 --> 01:24:50,226
You thought about it too late,
Orsa.

783
01:24:50,587 --> 01:24:54,978
Now families, women
have to stay together.

784
01:24:57,027 --> 01:25:02,181
<i>In retaliation for the sinking of
the HOOD and the loss of 1,300 men...</i>

785
01:25:02,587 --> 01:25:07,024
<i>... British naval forces
in the Atlantic...</i>

786
01:25:07,467 --> 01:25:13,099
<i>... have hunted down and sunk
the BISMARCK...</i>

787
01:25:13,387 --> 01:25:17,505
<i>... sending a thousand Germans
to a watery grave.</i>

788
01:25:18,547 --> 01:25:23,416
They'll bomb fuel tanks,
docks, customs houses...

789
01:25:24,427 --> 01:25:26,145
They'll target the ports first.

790
01:25:27,467 --> 01:25:30,220
The SS KYMOTHOE
is sailing for Marseille.

791
01:25:30,467 --> 01:25:32,344
And the SS ARCHIPELAGOS
for Konstanz.

792
01:25:32,387 --> 01:25:35,584
20 years after the Great War
and we're at it again.

793
01:25:36,427 --> 01:25:39,066
Since I was 13...
50 years at sea...

794
01:25:40,067 --> 01:25:42,820
And now you're leaving and
I'm staying here on the rock...

795
01:25:43,147 --> 01:25:45,786
...like an old crab
with its claws broken...

796
01:25:46,147 --> 01:25:49,344
You'll look out for the women.
And the children.

797
01:26:05,827 --> 01:26:07,340
See you tonight.

798
01:26:09,627 --> 01:26:11,026
So long.

799
01:26:11,067 --> 01:26:13,103
Take care.

800
01:26:16,667 --> 01:26:20,103
It's been 20 years since our
NAUTILUS was sunk...

801
01:26:20,147 --> 01:26:22,263
...with all hands on board.

802
01:26:22,587 --> 01:26:27,058
And I still remember that night
going from village to village...

803
01:26:27,387 --> 01:26:30,379
...alone on my mule
to notify the families.

804
01:26:32,027 --> 01:26:36,179
I'm haunted by that night. I don't
want to go through that again.

805
01:26:39,187 --> 01:26:41,303
Do I have the five?

806
01:26:41,987 --> 01:26:44,137
From the Korthian villages?

807
01:26:44,547 --> 01:26:46,026
Those poor boys?

808
01:26:46,067 --> 01:26:50,345
Their seaman's books are ready.
All five are signing on.

809
01:27:00,547 --> 01:27:03,107
I knew their fathers well...

810
01:27:04,347 --> 01:27:06,542
And I've checked out the sons...

811
01:27:12,067 --> 01:27:13,295
Thank you.

812
01:27:19,547 --> 01:27:20,775
Spyros...

813
01:27:21,947 --> 01:27:25,098
Take Orsa and go home.

814
01:27:25,587 --> 01:27:29,466
I'm popping over to the doctor
for a cough syrup to have in stock...

815
01:27:29,787 --> 01:27:31,015
...and I'm coming.

816
01:28:46,307 --> 01:28:47,786
Good evening.

817
01:28:55,347 --> 01:28:57,577
The Maltabes Clan.

818
01:28:58,747 --> 01:29:00,624
"Little England".

819
01:29:04,827 --> 01:29:06,579
"Little England".

820
01:29:07,187 --> 01:29:12,136
I've loaded copper in Valparaiso
and am heading for Buenos Aires.

821
01:29:12,547 --> 01:29:14,219
We get there, unload...

822
01:29:14,267 --> 01:29:19,261
...and to thank the crew, I take them
all to a club, the La Paloma.

823
01:29:19,307 --> 01:29:21,377
I've heard about it.

824
01:29:21,627 --> 01:29:25,905
Don't be cross with us! It's my knee.
That's why we're late.

825
01:29:26,267 --> 01:29:28,940
- Hope you're better soon, Nana.
- It's been swollen for ten days.

826
01:29:30,467 --> 01:29:33,220
There are 1317 postcards
in my collection.

827
01:29:33,467 --> 01:29:35,378
The only country I don't have
a postcard from is Albania.

828
01:29:35,627 --> 01:29:38,346
I don't even know what it's like...
And tomorrow so many young men...

829
01:29:38,627 --> 01:29:41,505
...who were my pupils
will be going to fight there.

830
01:29:41,827 --> 01:29:44,625
Why is Spyros so late?
He left the office hours ago.

831
01:29:44,907 --> 01:29:47,216
- Right after the signatures.
- What signatures?

832
01:29:47,587 --> 01:29:48,781
Here he is.

833
01:29:49,027 --> 01:29:50,255
Good evening.

834
01:29:50,467 --> 01:29:52,025
There you are! Where were you?

835
01:29:52,347 --> 01:29:54,099
I had to say goodbye
to a lot of people...

836
01:29:54,507 --> 01:29:56,623
- How are you, Katerina?
- I'm fine, Spyros.

837
01:30:19,267 --> 01:30:21,303
Our LITTLE ENGLAND.

838
01:30:22,347 --> 01:30:25,544
LITTLE ENGLAND?
Strange name for a ship.

839
01:30:26,347 --> 01:30:30,260
No doubt it was little Moscha's idea.
She's so fluent in English.

840
01:30:30,587 --> 01:30:31,337
Definitely!

841
01:30:31,627 --> 01:30:37,224
Registered tonnage 4,978, cargo...

842
01:30:37,467 --> 01:30:39,503
...tonnage 7500.

843
01:30:39,787 --> 01:30:42,699
Price 92,000 pounds.

844
01:30:43,067 --> 01:30:43,977
Bravo!

845
01:30:44,027 --> 01:30:46,063
Congratulations!

846
01:30:46,307 --> 01:30:48,059
Spyros Maltabes,
mission accomplished.

847
01:30:48,307 --> 01:30:49,217
You are now a ship owner.

848
01:30:52,387 --> 01:30:55,777
Ammonia, nitrate, naphthalene...

849
01:30:56,147 --> 01:30:58,615
...varnishes and tar.

850
01:31:00,227 --> 01:31:03,139
I took on all the dangerous cargo.

851
01:31:03,387 --> 01:31:07,266
I worked... like a dog.

852
01:31:07,547 --> 01:31:09,185
Mines and torpedoes everywhere.

853
01:31:09,387 --> 01:31:12,026
You picked the time to invest
all your savings on shipboards.

854
01:31:12,187 --> 01:31:14,462
I've been waiting for it
for 10 years.

855
01:31:18,547 --> 01:31:20,697
I dreamed about it.

856
01:31:22,827 --> 01:31:24,385
You're completely mad!

857
01:31:24,747 --> 01:31:26,783
Congratulations.
May she be seaworthy.

858
01:31:27,027 --> 01:31:31,020
Our madman has guts.
That's common knowledge.

859
01:31:31,787 --> 01:31:35,063
Be careful you don't get caught
up in the injustice of war.

860
01:31:35,267 --> 01:31:36,382
That's my business.

861
01:31:38,387 --> 01:31:42,062
The injustice of war rings out
in my ears... in yours...

862
01:31:45,587 --> 01:31:49,421
And there are other injustices
that weigh down my soul.

863
01:31:57,107 --> 01:31:58,460
Godspeed...

864
01:31:58,747 --> 01:32:00,100
And a safe return.

865
01:32:00,387 --> 01:32:01,297
For everyone.

866
01:32:01,547 --> 01:32:02,024
Amen!

867
01:32:02,467 --> 01:32:03,900
Cheers!

868
01:32:04,467 --> 01:32:05,456
Cheers!

869
01:32:05,827 --> 01:32:07,101
Amen!

870
01:32:07,147 --> 01:32:09,103
It's the first time...

871
01:32:09,467 --> 01:32:13,176
...that the three captains of the
house are on the island together...

872
01:32:13,467 --> 01:32:16,743
...and sitting at the same table,
mother.

873
01:32:17,067 --> 01:32:20,025
The first time in so many years.

874
01:32:20,067 --> 01:32:21,864
Their health!

875
01:32:35,347 --> 01:32:36,700
Orsa...

876
01:32:46,747 --> 01:32:48,465
Orsa...

877
01:32:51,707 --> 01:32:53,538
I leave at daybreak.

878
01:33:05,907 --> 01:33:09,104
All night I've been searching
for your eyes...

879
01:33:11,027 --> 01:33:14,417
...and it's as if for you
I don't exist...

880
01:33:14,467 --> 01:33:16,344
Take care...

881
01:33:17,427 --> 01:33:19,782
Take care of yourself...

882
01:33:22,467 --> 01:33:27,382
Please, I beg you,
take care of yourself.

883
01:33:30,387 --> 01:33:32,457
My love.

884
01:33:37,787 --> 01:33:40,779
<i>- Take care, Spyros.
- May the daybreak find us well!</i>

885
01:33:41,027 --> 01:33:42,255
<i>Good night.</i>

886
01:33:42,307 --> 01:33:44,138
<i>- We all had a lovely time.
- Be well!</i>

887
01:33:44,187 --> 01:33:46,064
<i>Thank you very much, Mina.</i>

888
01:33:46,307 --> 01:33:48,184
<i>Good night and have
a safe journey back!</i>

889
01:33:48,467 --> 01:33:49,900
<i>- Bon voyage!
- Goodbye!</i>

890
01:34:02,147 --> 01:34:07,858
Our Father which art in Heaven,
make us good and drunk this day.

891
01:34:16,267 --> 01:34:17,746
I'm three months pregnant...

892
01:34:22,347 --> 01:34:23,575
He doesn't know.

893
01:34:25,987 --> 01:34:28,455
He hasn't touched me
in two and a half months.

894
01:34:30,307 --> 01:34:32,457
He's changed, Orsa... completely.

895
01:34:33,987 --> 01:34:37,104
Running about, worries, bills...

896
01:34:40,427 --> 01:34:42,782
And how can I tell him now?

897
01:34:46,147 --> 01:34:49,344
How can I tell him now
that he's leaving...

898
01:36:06,867 --> 01:36:12,419
<i>Early in the morning...</i>

899
01:36:13,707 --> 01:36:19,304
<i>... the myrrh-bearing women
came to Thee...</i>

900
01:36:20,947 --> 01:36:23,859
<i>... and sprinkled myrrh...</i>

901
01:36:24,627 --> 01:36:27,505
<i>... on Thy tomb.</i>

902
01:36:29,107 --> 01:36:34,420
<i>O my sweet spring...</i>

903
01:36:35,507 --> 01:36:40,979
<i>... my sweetest Child...</i>

904
01:36:42,827 --> 01:36:48,345
<i>Where has all Thy beauty faded?</i>

905
01:37:32,827 --> 01:37:38,459
<i>Him who now and forever
stills the winds, calms the waves...</i>

906
01:37:38,747 --> 01:37:41,261
<i>... causes storms
to cease and stirs...</i>

907
01:37:41,547 --> 01:37:45,222
<i>... the good and fitting winds
and climes...</i>

908
01:37:45,267 --> 01:37:48,145
<i>... be forever commander and mate
to Thy servants...</i>

909
01:37:48,187 --> 01:37:52,305
<i>... and guide them to safe havens.
Amen.</i>

910
01:38:43,947 --> 01:38:46,620
<i>The blue flows...
And we flow with it.</i>

911
01:38:48,227 --> 01:38:51,344
<i>With them... on the waves.</i>

912
01:38:56,267 --> 01:38:57,985
The silver candlesticks.

913
01:39:05,147 --> 01:39:08,139
For that humble home.
It's shameful...

914
01:39:08,587 --> 01:39:10,464
Well, they don't have electricity
there.

915
01:39:14,067 --> 01:39:16,342
- Let them have the binoculars.
- I need them.

916
01:39:17,267 --> 01:39:19,701
Bring the silver teaspoons as well.

917
01:39:20,387 --> 01:39:23,902
What are they going to do with them
up there in the desolate mountains?

918
01:39:25,627 --> 01:39:28,016
They're simple folk...
farmers with spades.

919
01:39:28,267 --> 01:39:29,939
They'll take a shine to them.

920
01:39:30,227 --> 01:39:32,616
We can't eat them
and the children need food.

921
01:39:34,427 --> 01:39:37,260
Trade them for chickens,
cheese, flour.

922
01:39:38,147 --> 01:39:40,422
Tell them we've also got curtains
and carpets...

923
01:39:42,947 --> 01:39:44,619
...for the next time...

924
01:39:47,987 --> 01:39:49,625
Just a minute. Wait.

925
01:39:59,427 --> 01:40:00,542
For the road...

926
01:40:04,587 --> 01:40:07,943
So tell me... do Italian women
have butts...

927
01:40:08,347 --> 01:40:09,302
...wobbly ones...

928
01:40:09,547 --> 01:40:10,900
Englishwomen?

929
01:40:11,307 --> 01:40:13,343
Broad... and withered!

930
01:40:13,707 --> 01:40:15,459
German women?

931
01:40:16,427 --> 01:40:19,385
Krupp butts. As big as a tank.

932
01:40:19,747 --> 01:40:24,775
Good boy Savvas. Now tell me...
Argentinean women down there...

933
01:40:25,107 --> 01:40:27,177
What sort of asses do they have?

934
01:40:28,587 --> 01:40:30,225
Steaming!

935
01:40:30,587 --> 01:40:32,623
You aced that one!

936
01:40:34,027 --> 01:40:37,303
How many hurricanes have
you been in, Grandpa?

937
01:40:37,667 --> 01:40:40,056
Too many to count.

938
01:40:41,267 --> 01:40:44,862
- The worst sea is the Bay of Biscay?
- Cursed.

939
01:40:46,027 --> 01:40:49,099
Her ocean bed is full
of scattered bones.

940
01:40:49,787 --> 01:40:51,937
The biggest graveyard for our lot.

941
01:40:53,467 --> 01:40:58,621
Grandfather, who do you think
is the most fearless captain?

942
01:40:59,187 --> 01:41:01,303
Dad or Uncle Spyros?

943
01:41:04,027 --> 01:41:06,097
What a question, you rascal!

944
01:41:11,627 --> 01:41:15,063
<i>... as the German stukas
of the Wehrmacht bombed...</i>

945
01:41:15,107 --> 01:41:21,296
<i>... and sank ten destroyers and
torpedo boats of the Hellenic Navy...</i>

946
01:41:24,867 --> 01:41:30,385
<i>... the PSARRAS, the HYDRA,
the THYELLA, the DOREIS...</i>

947
01:41:31,507 --> 01:41:36,945
<i>... the KYDONEAE, the AEGLI,
the KIOS, the KIZIKOS...</i>

948
01:41:38,027 --> 01:41:40,541
<i>... the PERGAMOS,
the ARETHUSA...</i>

949
01:41:44,067 --> 01:41:47,264
<i>During the attempted
invasion of Crete...</i>

950
01:41:47,307 --> 01:41:49,662
<i>... the resistance
of the inhabitants...</i>

951
01:41:50,027 --> 01:41:52,302
<i>... resulted in the massacre...</i>

952
01:41:52,667 --> 01:41:57,183
<i>... of the 7th parachute division
of the Germans.</i>

953
01:41:58,747 --> 01:42:02,581
LITTLE ENGLAND

954
01:42:09,427 --> 01:42:13,625
<i>In the Atlantic, the greatest threat
comes not from the huge waves...</i>

955
01:42:13,867 --> 01:42:16,301
<i>... and the freezing cold,
but from German submarines...</i>

956
01:42:16,587 --> 01:42:22,219
<i>... which attack allied convoys
like wolf packs in the night.</i>

957
01:42:23,147 --> 01:42:26,856
<i>The battle for naval supremacy
is crucial to the outcome of the war.</i>

958
01:42:27,147 --> 01:42:30,219
In just the last month
14 Greek ships were lost.

959
01:42:30,267 --> 01:42:31,985
As for rescue operations...

960
01:42:32,027 --> 01:42:34,177
Rescue operations?
What rescue operations?

961
01:42:34,467 --> 01:42:35,616
The Americans have stopped it!

962
01:42:35,827 --> 01:42:37,465
How many will die
in the icy waters...

963
01:42:37,707 --> 01:42:39,857
...and how many
will be eaten by sharks?

964
01:42:41,707 --> 01:42:44,267
What the hell am I doing
in the Indian Ocean?

965
01:42:46,147 --> 01:42:51,221
Yannis. Signal the British
that we're changing course.

966
01:42:51,267 --> 01:42:52,746
Come on, lads!

967
01:42:53,067 --> 01:42:54,295
Let's go!

968
01:42:59,747 --> 01:43:02,784
The children ask me why
she's called Hexadaktylou...

969
01:43:02,987 --> 01:43:04,545
...since she's got five fingers!

970
01:43:08,507 --> 01:43:10,145
Listen to me...

971
01:43:10,187 --> 01:43:13,099
We have children,
we have obligations...

972
01:43:13,347 --> 01:43:14,541
...and we've got to hold out!

973
01:43:18,187 --> 01:43:21,543
Keep playing the piano,
Hexadaktylou! I'll open.

974
01:43:22,427 --> 01:43:23,826
There you are!

975
01:43:24,187 --> 01:43:26,940
- I thought we said at 2:00.
- We're half an hour late!

976
01:43:27,227 --> 01:43:29,138
Finally!
We've already had the first drink.

977
01:43:29,347 --> 01:43:31,815
- Where were you?
- We were waiting for you!

978
01:43:36,267 --> 01:43:38,098
Many happy returns.

979
01:43:38,347 --> 01:43:40,178
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

980
01:43:40,547 --> 01:43:42,139
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

981
01:43:42,187 --> 01:43:44,496
Others are resisting
in the mountains with guns...

982
01:43:44,787 --> 01:43:47,096
...while chicken-hearted me,
with the piano... And raki.

983
01:43:47,347 --> 01:43:49,178
Just raki. Straight!

984
01:43:49,627 --> 01:43:52,266
I traded the piano stool
for half a bottle.

985
01:43:52,467 --> 01:43:54,025
- Next week the piano goes.
- Don't.

986
01:43:57,427 --> 01:43:58,985
Katina? Marie?

987
01:43:59,027 --> 01:44:02,815
They're in Athens...
nursing the wounded.

988
01:44:09,987 --> 01:44:11,784
"This is the BBC.

989
01:44:13,547 --> 01:44:18,337
Air and naval battles from
Midway to the Coral Sea...

990
01:44:19,187 --> 01:44:22,702
...and from the North Sea
to Madagascar.

991
01:44:23,547 --> 01:44:28,223
Also, allied convoys
to transport munitions...

992
01:44:28,627 --> 01:44:31,095
...from America to Europe.

993
01:44:32,107 --> 01:44:33,222
And...

994
01:44:33,467 --> 01:44:38,825
...1,5 million Germans
dead in Russia."

995
01:44:39,747 --> 01:44:42,944
1,5 million Germans dead.

996
01:44:43,387 --> 01:44:46,060
In this instance I have to hand it
to the communists.

997
01:44:46,787 --> 01:44:52,339
They gave their word
that they would win, Kiki.

998
01:44:53,827 --> 01:44:57,342
That some day they'll
come back to us...

999
01:44:57,387 --> 01:45:01,426
...bringing lice in mounds
instead of pounds.

1000
01:45:01,787 --> 01:45:05,496
Love's mystic sails,
and no more black veils!

1001
01:45:06,467 --> 01:45:08,025
No more black veils!

1002
01:45:10,987 --> 01:45:12,022
Madame...

1003
01:45:13,467 --> 01:45:15,264
I won't take no for an answer.

1004
01:45:28,347 --> 01:45:30,224
I'm the man you missed
all these years.

1005
01:45:47,307 --> 01:45:50,140
That's the way my Mikes
used to dance with me.

1006
01:45:52,387 --> 01:45:56,380
How I wish he were alive and never
mind his farting day and night.

1007
01:45:57,267 --> 01:45:59,417
Actually, I miss his farts...

1008
01:46:04,307 --> 01:46:06,423
Believe it or not...

1009
01:46:06,827 --> 01:46:11,378
...I still have the taste
of Vangelis' kiss on my lips...

1010
01:46:11,427 --> 01:46:15,056
...even if he was lost at sea
17 years ago...

1011
01:46:15,107 --> 01:46:17,462
How time flies...

1012
01:46:18,427 --> 01:46:21,783
With war... and peace.

1013
01:46:23,467 --> 01:46:25,537
With love affairs and childbirths.

1014
01:46:26,427 --> 01:46:29,658
With yearning... and dignity.

1015
01:46:31,947 --> 01:46:33,175
With work...

1016
01:46:33,627 --> 01:46:35,777
...and the Etesian winds.

1017
01:46:47,067 --> 01:46:50,059
Katerina, your song!

1018
01:46:50,107 --> 01:46:53,179
From that lovely record
Vangelis had sent you.

1019
01:46:54,187 --> 01:46:55,745
Come on, say the words...

1020
01:46:56,147 --> 01:46:57,421
I don't know what they mean.

1021
01:46:57,787 --> 01:46:59,186
We don't need to know.

1022
01:46:59,627 --> 01:47:03,859
Russian songs are very suited
to sadness. More than any others!

1023
01:48:03,227 --> 01:48:06,219
Poor things, they have no news...

1024
01:48:41,427 --> 01:48:44,544
Bafaloukas, Falangas...

1025
01:48:46,067 --> 01:48:48,023
...Piangos, Michas, Tziotis...

1026
01:48:50,027 --> 01:48:55,465
22 from the THRASYVOULOS
and 26 from the PANACHRANTOU.

1027
01:48:56,907 --> 01:49:00,502
The first men from Andros
lost in this war.

1028
01:49:01,707 --> 01:49:04,460
They want their memorial sweet...

1029
01:49:12,147 --> 01:49:14,422
Tie the oilskin pouches...

1030
01:49:14,467 --> 01:49:18,221
...with your seaman's book
and diploma to your waists.

1031
01:49:18,467 --> 01:49:22,585
So they can identify our bodies
if the worst comes to the worst.

1032
01:50:07,227 --> 01:50:08,660
For Andros.

1033
01:50:09,587 --> 01:50:10,861
For Andros.

1034
01:50:12,187 --> 01:50:14,257
Come on, lads.

1035
01:51:08,627 --> 01:51:10,345
Good evening.

1036
01:51:16,587 --> 01:51:17,906
Good evening, Moscha.

1037
01:51:28,867 --> 01:51:33,065
From our London offices
and the British Red Cross...

1038
01:51:34,067 --> 01:51:36,262
...we have learnt that...

1039
01:51:41,667 --> 01:51:45,296
...a submarine picked up
three of our men...

1040
01:51:46,547 --> 01:51:49,505
...Zanakis, Maistros...

1041
01:51:52,307 --> 01:51:53,535
...and Boussoulas.

1042
01:51:55,947 --> 01:52:01,067
They said that Spyros put them
in the lifeboat... he ordered them.

1043
01:52:05,507 --> 01:52:08,544
They didn't see
what happened to him...

1044
01:52:08,987 --> 01:52:11,501
...if he managed to save himself...

1045
01:52:13,667 --> 01:52:15,897
LITTLE ENGLAND sank.

1046
01:52:39,067 --> 01:52:41,023
My love!

1047
01:52:43,067 --> 01:52:44,819
Spyros!

1048
01:52:46,307 --> 01:52:49,902
My love! Spyros!

1049
01:53:03,627 --> 01:53:05,265
Moscha!

1050
01:53:07,147 --> 01:53:08,023
Moscha!

1051
01:53:08,347 --> 01:53:12,545
My sister and my husband!
Where are you?

1052
01:53:17,387 --> 01:53:19,617
Behind my back!

1053
01:53:29,947 --> 01:53:31,824
Your children!

1054
01:53:40,307 --> 01:53:42,025
How many years behind my back?

1055
01:53:45,547 --> 01:53:46,900
How many?

1056
01:53:50,587 --> 01:53:52,578
What is this?

1057
01:53:53,907 --> 01:53:56,262
I'll tear you to pieces!

1058
01:54:16,467 --> 01:54:19,186
Don't come near me!
Don't come near me!

1059
01:54:19,227 --> 01:54:21,263
Keep away from me!

1060
01:54:35,147 --> 01:54:40,221
He was here in '33.

1061
01:54:43,387 --> 01:54:49,303
And Mersina was born in '34.

1062
01:54:50,987 --> 01:54:52,386
Speak up.

1063
01:54:54,307 --> 01:54:58,186
Who is her father?
Your husband or mine?

1064
01:56:18,427 --> 01:56:21,464
So he asked for Orsa's hand first.

1065
01:56:23,027 --> 01:56:25,222
And I'm finding out about it now.

1066
01:56:26,187 --> 01:56:28,655
15 years later...

1067
01:56:30,107 --> 01:56:35,977
And you, mother... monster...
you who are so calculating...

1068
01:56:36,027 --> 01:56:39,303
...and nothing gets by you.
What did you reply...

1069
01:56:39,667 --> 01:56:43,057
...when he came back and asked for
the hand of your second daughter?

1070
01:56:43,347 --> 01:56:45,144
What did you tell him? Nothing!

1071
01:56:45,667 --> 01:56:48,022
You just chose to ignore it,
just like that.

1072
01:56:48,067 --> 01:56:50,137
You're responsible for all this.

1073
01:56:51,147 --> 01:56:53,217
How could you?

1074
01:56:54,467 --> 01:56:57,345
What kind of woman are you?
What kind of mother?

1075
01:57:02,267 --> 01:57:04,383
What kind of woman am I?

1076
01:57:04,467 --> 01:57:07,186
Well, speak up! Let's hear it!

1077
01:57:08,187 --> 01:57:10,223
What kind of woman am I?

1078
01:57:13,387 --> 01:57:15,696
What kind of mother am I?

1079
01:57:18,187 --> 01:57:21,577
Look who's talking. You...

1080
01:57:21,827 --> 01:57:27,106
You who only sent word from
the other side of the planet...

1081
01:57:27,467 --> 01:57:30,140
...while I fought, I fought,
I fought alone...

1082
01:57:30,547 --> 01:57:33,220
The house, two difficult females...

1083
01:57:33,547 --> 01:57:39,463
...staying close and consoling
the widows of the seamen...

1084
01:57:41,067 --> 01:57:44,264
...present at the 40-day memorials,
the annual memorials...

1085
01:57:44,547 --> 01:57:48,017
...the 6-month memorials...
What kind of woman am I?

1086
01:57:52,547 --> 01:57:56,096
Never failing to convey
your condolences...

1087
01:57:57,707 --> 01:58:00,096
What kind of woman am I?
What kind...

1088
01:58:02,827 --> 01:58:06,786
You destroyed us... mother.

1089
01:58:08,147 --> 01:58:10,297
We destroyed...

1090
01:58:12,707 --> 01:58:14,698
...we destroyed our own children.

1091
01:58:23,427 --> 01:58:25,543
If he's alive?

1092
01:58:27,307 --> 01:58:30,219
If he comes back?
What will he do?

1093
01:58:33,587 --> 01:58:35,384
What will become of us?

1094
01:58:37,947 --> 01:58:40,415
Your children will not be left
without a father.

1095
01:59:15,307 --> 01:59:18,026
<i>Freedom, at last!
Moscha, turn the radio on.</i>

1096
01:59:20,987 --> 01:59:23,945
I just want him to be alive
and well.

1097
01:59:24,387 --> 01:59:26,696
The people are waiting. Come along.

1098
01:59:29,467 --> 01:59:31,981
Please be patient... wait.

1099
01:59:47,467 --> 01:59:49,025
Silence, please.

1100
01:59:49,067 --> 01:59:53,663
Many were seen by Karyotakis,
Loukissas and Sybouras. Ask them.

1101
01:59:53,987 --> 01:59:57,263
Athanasios Boulmetis, cook.
Did you see him anywhere?

1102
01:59:57,667 --> 02:00:02,297
I saw him in Japan 6 months ago.
In a concentration camp. He's ok.

1103
02:00:02,627 --> 02:00:05,983
Giorgakis Kalogirou? He was
a boatswain on the CYCLADES.

1104
02:00:06,227 --> 02:00:08,024
He's alive. He was with me
in the Philippines.

1105
02:00:08,227 --> 02:00:11,299
General MacArthour freed
5,000 prisoners. He's coming home.

1106
02:00:11,587 --> 02:00:14,101
Any good news about my brother,
Alexandros Kyrtatas?

1107
02:00:14,467 --> 02:00:16,583
He too was a seaman on the CYCLADES.

1108
02:00:16,827 --> 02:00:20,581
My father, a radio operator on the
THEOMITOR, Gerassimos Balas.

1109
02:00:20,987 --> 02:00:22,943
When's he coming?

1110
02:00:23,187 --> 02:00:25,143
Son, there in the Philippines...

1111
02:00:25,427 --> 02:00:28,021
...did you happen to see
my two boys?

1112
02:00:28,427 --> 02:00:33,455
Halas! Family name Halas...
Two boys as tall as cypress trees.

1113
02:00:35,187 --> 02:00:37,542
I don't know.
I didn't happen to see them.

1114
02:00:52,267 --> 02:00:56,226
I was going to come...
I was going to come to the house...

1115
02:00:58,747 --> 02:01:03,059
All 22 of us... he put us
in the lifeboat... all of us.

1116
02:01:03,627 --> 02:01:05,424
All 22 of us.

1117
02:01:06,467 --> 02:01:09,698
We didn't want to go...
I didn't want to go.

1118
02:01:12,467 --> 02:01:15,061
He cussed me, he ordered me,
he gave me a couple of punches...

1119
02:01:15,307 --> 02:01:17,025
...and threw me into the lifeboat.

1120
02:01:21,587 --> 02:01:23,498
I didn't want to leave him.

1121
02:01:37,187 --> 02:01:41,419
<i>Valiant men...</i>

1122
02:01:41,907 --> 02:01:45,582
<i>... of Andros.</i>

1123
02:01:47,707 --> 02:01:51,302
<i>Bones scattered in the depths...</i>

1124
02:01:54,307 --> 02:01:57,265
Orsa... Would you like
the binoculars?

1125
02:01:59,067 --> 02:02:01,137
<i>... of distant oceans...</i>

1126
02:02:01,587 --> 02:02:03,259
Go away.

1127
02:02:04,307 --> 02:02:09,062
<i>... in the embrace of history...</i>

1128
02:02:11,907 --> 02:02:17,539
<i>... they tell of mourning and sorrow.</i>

1129
02:02:23,267 --> 02:02:28,261
<i>For us there is no forgetting...</i>

1130
02:02:29,387 --> 02:02:34,302
<i>... a journey with open sails.</i>

1131
02:02:34,347 --> 02:02:40,502
<i>In sorrow and pride...</i>

1132
02:02:42,307 --> 02:02:47,779
<i>... with laurel wreaths.</i>

1133
02:03:31,947 --> 02:03:34,222
A heavy toll of blood...

1134
02:03:35,627 --> 02:03:40,257
...since 31 ships from Andros sunk.

1135
02:03:42,347 --> 02:03:47,216
On the last convoy it joined
the freighter LITTLE ENGLAND...

1136
02:03:48,187 --> 02:03:52,544
...was carrying cotton and wheat
from New Orleans.

1137
02:03:54,267 --> 02:03:57,657
It was torpedoed
off the Irish Coast...

1138
02:03:58,107 --> 02:04:02,225
...on 11 March 1943.

1139
02:04:04,027 --> 02:04:09,624
<i>Spyros Maltabes sacrificed
his life for his men.</i>

1140
02:04:11,187 --> 02:04:14,304
<i>He stayed on the bridge...</i>

1141
02:04:15,067 --> 02:04:18,457
<i>... and went down with his ship.</i>

1142
02:04:20,347 --> 02:04:23,578
<i>The Bronze Medal for Valor
belongs to his family.</i>

1143
02:04:39,307 --> 02:04:41,867
The sixth Maltabes to die.

1144
02:04:58,307 --> 02:04:59,581
His daughter.

1145
02:06:45,147 --> 02:06:46,785
I'm sorry...

1146
02:07:01,827 --> 02:07:03,545
I know all about it.

1147
02:07:07,107 --> 02:07:08,859
She dresses in black...

1148
02:07:10,987 --> 02:07:13,660
She won't eat.
She never leaves the house...

1149
02:07:14,427 --> 02:07:17,419
We haven't spoken
in almost 3 years.

1150
02:07:18,627 --> 02:07:20,219
We don't talk.

1151
02:07:21,147 --> 02:07:24,219
But the whole island
is talking about us.

1152
02:07:26,187 --> 02:07:28,781
There's no room for all of us
on Andros any more.

1153
02:08:08,467 --> 02:08:11,698
You'll be better off without me...

1154
02:08:13,107 --> 02:08:15,177
...there...

1155
02:08:19,187 --> 02:08:23,066
I lost... I lost friends
on the destroyer...

1156
02:08:24,867 --> 02:08:27,256
...then others in the Middle East.

1157
02:08:27,547 --> 02:08:29,299
I lost the ships...

1158
02:08:30,547 --> 02:08:35,496
But I found a good job working
in a shipping office in New York.

1159
02:08:37,667 --> 02:08:40,306
That's where we're going
the four of us.

1160
02:08:41,267 --> 02:08:44,623
Others are also taking their families
and moving to England or America.

1161
02:08:46,507 --> 02:08:48,065
You'll like it there.

1162
02:08:52,307 --> 02:08:53,183
And mother?

1163
02:08:56,587 --> 02:08:58,225
She's staying here.

1164
02:09:02,267 --> 02:09:05,384
- Alone?
- She'll come later...

1165
02:09:07,587 --> 02:09:09,145
As soon as she's strong enough.

1166
02:09:09,387 --> 02:09:11,582
Are you punishing her?

1167
02:09:14,107 --> 02:09:17,019
You can leave, as many of you
as you like... go wherever you like.

1168
02:09:17,387 --> 02:09:20,424
I'm going to sea...
I'm getting my seaman's papers.

1169
02:09:25,667 --> 02:09:29,216
And yet it's the right thing for you.

1170
02:09:31,267 --> 02:09:32,541
Mersina...

1171
02:09:34,267 --> 02:09:36,019
My beauty.

1172
02:09:58,427 --> 02:10:00,065
Andros...

1173
02:10:08,187 --> 02:10:11,975
We have exhausted all the
options science has to offer.

1174
02:10:12,187 --> 02:10:15,020
I don't know what the professor
can contribute, but...

1175
02:10:15,267 --> 02:10:19,385
...if the patient doesn't cooperate
there's nothing more we can do.

1176
02:10:26,107 --> 02:10:29,304
I brought so much medication,
so many syrups...

1177
02:10:29,347 --> 02:10:32,020
...tonic injections from America...

1178
02:10:32,067 --> 02:10:34,501
She throws the pills
out of the window.

1179
02:10:34,707 --> 02:10:39,542
Professor, I've asked you to come
to the island as a last resort...

1180
02:10:39,907 --> 02:10:43,024
We'll take her to Athens...
to London...

1181
02:10:44,507 --> 02:10:46,702
I'll sell the house if necessary...

1182
02:10:47,067 --> 02:10:51,697
Dyscataposia, atony, hardship
in general, I would say...

1183
02:10:52,387 --> 02:10:55,185
But the patient isn't cooperating.

1184
02:10:55,227 --> 02:10:58,060
Inside her the only thing
that's getting stronger...

1185
02:10:58,267 --> 02:10:59,939
...is the spirit of denial.

1186
02:11:00,747 --> 02:11:02,738
Uncle Emilios!

1187
02:11:07,427 --> 02:11:09,941
Where have you disappeared to
all this time?

1188
02:11:14,907 --> 02:11:16,135
Uncle Emilios!

1189
02:11:50,627 --> 02:11:55,178
FROM SPYROS MALTABES
TO EMILIOS MALTABES

1190
02:12:07,187 --> 02:12:10,259
FOR LITTLE ORSA

1191
02:12:31,107 --> 02:12:35,339
<i>Give me the letters.
All 17 of them.</i>

1192
02:12:36,427 --> 02:12:38,418
<i>I'm tired.</i>

1193
02:12:38,787 --> 02:12:40,857
<i>I need to know...</i>

1194
02:12:42,107 --> 02:12:44,257
...how much he loved you.

1195
02:12:47,947 --> 02:12:50,336
I must know if he ever loved me too.

1196
02:12:52,587 --> 02:12:54,384
Orsa...

1197
02:13:36,547 --> 02:13:38,583
What's become of you?

1198
02:13:53,187 --> 02:13:55,337
Calcutta...

1199
02:13:56,507 --> 02:14:01,501
27 September 1929.

1200
02:14:04,307 --> 02:14:06,025
Surabaya...

1201
02:14:07,427 --> 02:14:10,578
7 October 1929.

1202
02:14:12,347 --> 02:14:14,144
Lorenzo Marques...

1203
02:14:15,187 --> 02:14:19,863
13 March 1930.

1204
02:14:25,507 --> 02:14:27,338
Odessa...

1205
02:14:30,267 --> 02:14:32,383
2 May 1930.

1206
02:14:38,267 --> 02:14:41,862
All written in '29 and '30...

1207
02:14:43,707 --> 02:14:46,175
...before my marriage.

1208
02:14:49,227 --> 02:14:53,823
I had learnt to think of him...

1209
02:14:55,267 --> 02:14:57,542
...and to love him...

1210
02:14:58,627 --> 02:15:00,743
...since I was 12.

1211
02:15:07,067 --> 02:15:08,898
It was in November.

1212
02:15:10,347 --> 02:15:12,656
There was a bad storm...

1213
02:15:17,627 --> 02:15:20,095
...and I saw him...

1214
02:15:24,587 --> 02:15:26,145
He was 19...

1215
02:15:30,747 --> 02:15:33,386
...throwing off his white shirt...

1216
02:15:36,027 --> 02:15:38,336
...and diving...

1217
02:15:39,427 --> 02:15:41,258
...into the waves...

1218
02:15:46,307 --> 02:15:48,537
...for a bet.

1219
02:15:52,147 --> 02:15:54,183
I wanted to love...

1220
02:15:58,787 --> 02:16:01,062
...to love very much...

1221
02:16:05,547 --> 02:16:07,617
...to love for ever.

1222
02:16:14,427 --> 02:16:16,019
He loved you, Moscha...

1223
02:16:20,027 --> 02:16:21,938
He loved you...

1224
02:16:26,587 --> 02:16:28,418
You are loved...

1225
02:16:34,547 --> 02:16:36,299
In life...

1226
02:16:40,947 --> 02:16:46,544
...it seems the things you lose...

1227
02:16:48,507 --> 02:16:50,577
...are worth more...

1228
02:16:51,387 --> 02:16:53,343
...than the things you find.

1229
02:16:53,387 --> 02:16:56,265
The things you find are lost again.

1230
02:16:57,427 --> 02:17:00,544
The things you lost exist for ever.

1231
02:18:09,267 --> 02:18:10,985
Orsa...

1232
02:18:41,867 --> 02:18:45,462
The Maltabes Circle...

1233
02:18:55,907 --> 02:18:58,057
Damned floorboards!

1234
02:19:02,987 --> 02:19:05,501
It's the ceiling's fault.

1235
02:19:07,667 --> 02:19:10,545
It wouldn't let me forget him.

1236
02:19:11,027 --> 02:19:14,337
I could hear his high spirits...

1237
02:19:15,107 --> 02:19:17,667
...his words, his footsteps...

1238
02:19:19,307 --> 02:19:21,343
...when he took off his shoes...

1239
02:19:23,707 --> 02:19:26,301
...the muffled tomfoolery...

1240
02:19:27,947 --> 02:19:31,542
...your bodies thrashing
on the bed...

1241
02:19:46,387 --> 02:19:48,582
The floorboards.

1242
02:19:53,387 --> 02:19:55,264
Before the wedding...

1243
02:19:57,547 --> 02:20:00,300
...he was to make a down payment
on a house in Kastella...

1244
02:20:01,587 --> 02:20:03,066
...in Piraeus.

1245
02:20:05,707 --> 02:20:08,585
I told him I'm not leaving Andros.

1246
02:20:18,467 --> 02:20:21,777
That day when you had us
for dinner...

1247
02:20:23,307 --> 02:20:26,060
...and I went to fetch Nana...

1248
02:20:27,027 --> 02:20:29,587
Who was limping. I remember.

1249
02:20:35,067 --> 02:20:37,376
Before going to her house...

1250
02:20:38,627 --> 02:20:40,857
...I met him...

1251
02:20:41,867 --> 02:20:45,223
...for the first time,
secretly and alone...

1252
02:20:46,707 --> 02:20:48,823
...after ten years...

1253
02:20:50,427 --> 02:20:52,463
...for half an hour...

1254
02:20:56,467 --> 02:20:58,503
...by the sea...

1255
02:20:59,627 --> 02:21:01,345
...on the rocks...

1256
02:21:12,107 --> 02:21:14,257
SOS...

1257
02:21:14,307 --> 02:21:20,496
...that's what he wrote
with his hand on my breast.

1258
02:21:23,107 --> 02:21:25,223
SOS.

1259
02:22:52,827 --> 02:22:56,058
She asked to attend the service
because Saint Nicholas...

1260
02:22:56,387 --> 02:23:01,097
...is the patron saint of seamen and
all the men in her life were seamen.

1261
02:23:01,147 --> 02:23:04,662
Grandfather, father, uncles, husband,
son and the man she loved.

1262
02:23:05,547 --> 02:23:09,062
And she had the courage to name them
all to Moscha in just that order.

1263
02:23:09,307 --> 02:23:12,583
I don't care what some people say...
I love them both.

1264
02:23:58,187 --> 02:24:00,940
Do you have any photograph of hers?

1265
02:24:01,587 --> 02:24:03,543
In my mind, a lot...

1266
02:24:04,027 --> 02:24:07,019
Ever since I picked her up
off the street...

1267
02:24:08,107 --> 02:24:12,259
...adopted her child...
unknown father...

1268
02:24:14,347 --> 02:24:19,182
Last night I felt like telling Orsa,
before it's too late...

1269
02:24:19,507 --> 02:24:21,418
...and to Moscha of course...

1270
02:24:21,987 --> 02:24:25,662
...that they have a brother,
even though he's far away...

1271
02:24:26,907 --> 02:24:28,579
...but I didn't dare.

1272
02:24:30,187 --> 02:24:33,304
I made a mess of things
both here and there.

1273
02:24:36,547 --> 02:24:38,105
Spyros...

1274
02:24:40,867 --> 02:24:42,186
Spyros...

1275
02:24:51,867 --> 02:24:53,903
I finished it at dawn.

1276
02:24:58,107 --> 02:25:01,543
All alone on the waves.

1277
02:25:04,307 --> 02:25:05,581
Him too.

1278
02:25:31,147 --> 02:25:34,423
Neither of us
ever saw the ship up close...

1279
02:25:44,987 --> 02:25:46,545
Moscha...

1280
02:25:54,587 --> 02:25:57,385
...you're the only one
who isn't to blame.

1281
02:26:05,427 --> 02:26:09,784
Had he lived...

1282
02:26:14,507 --> 02:26:18,182
...what would have happened
with the two of us?

1283
02:26:27,387 --> 02:26:29,343
If only he had lived...

1284
02:26:41,227 --> 02:26:43,422
If we had studied...

1285
02:26:45,427 --> 02:26:46,860
...something...

1286
02:26:50,067 --> 02:26:52,376
If we had found a job...

1287
02:26:57,027 --> 02:26:59,461
Or if we had gone away...

1288
02:27:01,587 --> 02:27:03,339
...far away...

1289
02:27:07,387 --> 02:27:09,184
If we had talked...

1290
02:27:12,907 --> 02:27:14,977
If we had talked, Moscha...

1291
02:27:18,187 --> 02:27:20,576
...back then...

1292
02:28:12,787 --> 02:28:14,584
May!

1293
02:29:12,747 --> 02:29:16,456
