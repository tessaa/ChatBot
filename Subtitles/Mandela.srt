<i>Now, find a foreign journalist.</i>

484

Let's go.

<i>[Mandela] I want the world to know.</i>

486
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:02,045
OK, I've been accused of running away
and not standing up for my beliefs.

487
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,602
Now, tell them
that I will not give myself up

488
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,161
to a government I do not recognize.

489

<i>We have been forced
into an armed struggle.</i>

<i>The decision was not taken lightly
by myself or the people or the ANC.</i>

<i>[reporter] Brian Widlake, I TN News.</i>

492
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,605
I have a few questions for you.
Mr. Mandela,

493
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,325
if the government doesn't
give in to the concessions

494
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:37,202
- that you want, will there be violence?
- There is violence now.

495
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:41,046
For 50 years, we have been
talking peace and nonviolence.

496
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,761
The government's reply is violence,
armed attacks

497
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,730
on unarmed and defenseless people.

498
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,326
If you were us, what would you do?

499
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,201
Mr. Mandela, what is it
that you personally want?

500
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,010
I want freedom.

501
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:01,161
<i>I have beautiful children,
a beautiful wife.</i>

502

<i>I want them to walk free
in their own land.</i>

503
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,807
Madiba, we must go.

504
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,889
- Hey, it's Daddy.

- Are you smiling for Daddy?
- Do you want to come run with Dad?

512
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:44,449
Come, come, let's go.
Come. Come, Zeni.

513
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,850
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

514
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,162
I've lost the new job, though.

515
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:58,483
- I will see that you get some help.
- No. I'll be all right.

516
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,529
I knew how it would be.

517
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,400
Fight them.

518
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,642
I hate them so much.

00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,327
The detonator went off too soon.

I'm so sorry, Madiba.

525

It's not safe here anymore.

Quiet! Quiet!

572
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:05,326
My Lord, I call the case of the state
against the national high command

573
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:09,610
of Umkhonto we Sizwe, the military wing
of the African National Congress.

574
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,850
The state contends that the accused
are responsible for acts of sabotage

575
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:19,682
aimed at facilitating violent revolution
and an armed invasion of this country

576
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:23,327
with the intention
of overthrowing the government.

577
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:28,964
Accused number one, Nelson Mandela.

578
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:32,169
Do you plead guilty or not guilty?

579
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,561
My Lord, it is not I

580
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,803
but the government
that should be put in the dock.

581
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,440
- [crowd murmuring]
- I plead not guilty.

582

[crowd gasping]

583
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:46,723
The state has formally advised me

584
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,531
that they will be asking
for the supreme penalty

585
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,682
permissible by law.

586
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,564
Which is death.

587
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:59,083
Our best chance is to attack
the credibility of the charges.

588
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:02,642
We dispute every falsehood,
we challenge every charge.

589
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:06,683
We think they'll bring
in a guilty verdict,

590
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,884
but we might be able to
avoid the death sentence.

591
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,520
- Agreed?
- Agreed.

592
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,045
[muttering] Agreed.

593
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,849
Then be happy.

594
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,889
Smile.

595
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:27,125
This may be the greatest service
we will ever do for our people.

[chanting] Mandela! Mandela!

598
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,487
My name is Nelson Mandela.

599
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:52,330
I'm the first accused.

600
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:59,247
I do not deny that I planned sabotage.

601
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:02,051
I did not plan it

602
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,487
in a spirit of recklessness

603
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:08,008
nor because I have any love
for violence.

604
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:13,648
The hard facts are
that 50 years of non-violence

605
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,326
had brought the African people nothing

606
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:20,166
but more and more repressive legislation

607
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:22,721
and fewer and fewer rights.

608
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:26,441
Africans want

609
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:29,843
a just share
in the whole of South Africa.

610
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,731
We want equal political rights,

611
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,804
one man, one vote.

612
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:39,931
I have dedicated myself to this struggle
of the African people.

613
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:44,290
I have fought against white domination.

614
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,563
I have fought against black domination.

615
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:51,364
I have cherished the ideal of a free,

616
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,000
democratic society where all persons

617
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:58,171
live together in harmony
with equal opportunities.

618
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:02,811
It is an ideal which I hope to live for

619
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,650
and achieve,

620
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:08,521
but, if needs be,

621
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:10,921
it is an ideal for which

622
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:14,368
I am prepared to die.

Before the judge imposes
the supreme penalty,

628
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:00,887
there is one more step.

629
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:05,409
He will ask the first accused, Nelson,
"Have you any reason to advance

630
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,568
whether the sentence
should not be passed?"

631

- You could then say...
- I have nothing more to say.

632

That won't help your appeal.

633
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:16,842
There will be no appeal.

634
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,211
No appeal?

635

[crowd gasping]

641

The accused have made high moral claims
for their actions.

642
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:02,122
In essence, they have courted martyrdom

643
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:05,682
at the hands of what they call
"their oppressors."

01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:20,288
but some drunk hooligans.

809
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:23,569
What right do they have to assault us?

810
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:29,170
Now, are you part of a justice system
or gangsters in uniform?

811
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:32,011
You think you can scare me
with this shit about Pretoria?

812
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:34,049
If those idiots don't like what I do,

813
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:37,562
they can sack me.
I don't need their job.

814
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:39,722
My family's got five farms.

815
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:42,406
I've got money.
I do what I like.

816
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:49,685
Have you got anything else
to say to me?

817
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:51,769
Yes.

818
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:55,049
I've put in a request
for long trousers.

819
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,441
Long trousers.

820
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:02,044
He wants long trousers.

Speak English only.
Family matters only.

825
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:31,041
Any political talk,
and I'll terminate the visit. Sit.

Are you all right?

828
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:48,684
Yes, I'm all right.

829
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:50,888
Tell me about you.

830
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:54,727
I'm under a banning order.

831
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:58,524
But don't worry.

832
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:01,444
Our friends are helping me.

833
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:06,962
The girls send their love.

834
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:10,282
They want to see you.

835
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:12,204
I think of them every day.

[sighs]

837
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:16,648
You must tell them I love them.

838
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:22,009
They're not allowed visits
until they're 16.

839
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:26,722
Zindzi's not yet five.

840
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:33,690
- Tell me about the arrests.
- [sighs]

841
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:37,610
It's nothing I can't deal with.

842
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:41,731
They like to have little chats with me.

843
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:46,449
Usually they wait till just before
the girls come back from school

844
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:48,125
to take me away.

845
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:52,407
So the girls will find an empty home.

846
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:58,724
They think about these things,
you know.

847
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:03,848
They think about me a lot.

848
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:12,727
- How do you bear it?
- By hating them.

849
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:15,121
And don't tell me I'm wrong,
it keeps me strong.

850
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:17,926
Hey. Family matters only.

851
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:22,171
Your mother, Madiba,

852
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:24,209
she is sick.

853
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,128
They say she will die soon.

854
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:38,529
I have failed her.

855
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:40,045
No.

856
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:43,368
She understands.

857
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:46,210
And she's proud of you.

858
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:49,202
Is that true?

859
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:51,601
She told me so herself.

860
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:03,564
Mandela, let's go.

861

Mummy will come back.

Yes, Kathy, it is a trick,

We five are charged by the president

Are you sure that you can talk to me?

I am a member of a banned organization.

I don't trust them.
This is not the time to talk.

I don't think Madiba should be
talking to them on his own.

Let's just put it to the vote.

1218
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:30,810
I propose no private talks.

1219

And you, Walter?

1220

None of us are bigger than the movement.

Four against one.
Motion carried.

1222

I take note, comrades...

1223
01:39:46,600 --> 01:39:49,683
but I will do
what I believe is right.

1224
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:55,002
You have the most
powerful army in Africa.

1225
01:39:55,160 --> 01:39:57,606
There's no way
we can match you in battle,

1226
01:39:57,800 --> 01:40:00,406
but we have 30 million people.

1227
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:02,642
I would call that a stalemate.

1228
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:04,689
All right.

1229
01:40:05,880 --> 01:40:08,201
Here's the bottom line:

1230
01:40:08,360 --> 01:40:11,523
You end the violence,
and we'll give you a share in power.

1231
01:40:14,240 --> 01:40:15,969
A share?

1232
01:40:16,120 --> 01:40:20,762
Well, obviously, we can't accept
a crude one man, one vote system.

1233
01:40:20,920 --> 01:40:25,960
Yeah, if the blacks take over,
our country is finished.

1234
01:40:26,160 --> 01:40:27,446
We are finished.

"if the blacks take over..."

1237

Can you imagine
what the blacks would do to us

1238
01:40:33,120 --> 01:40:34,929

that persecuted his wife,

1245

[Barnard] I don't believe
you don't want revenge.

You are right.

1248
01:40:57,480 --> 01:40:59,130
I do.

1249
01:40:59,320 --> 01:41:00,924
So?

1250
01:41:01,080 --> 01:41:03,651
How can we ever allow you
to have any real power?

1251
01:41:03,800 --> 01:41:06,929
Well, I admit I want revenge,

1252
01:41:07,120 --> 01:41:09,691
but I want something more than that,

1253
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:13,322
and that is to live
without fear and hatred.

1254
01:41:14,280 --> 01:41:15,770
Sweet dreams, Mr. Mandela.

1255
01:41:15,960 --> 01:41:18,850
I have no choice.

1256
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,890
I have seen what fear
has done to your people.

1257
01:41:22,040 --> 01:41:23,929
You've always been afraid of us,

1258
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:27,641
and it has made you
an unjust and brutal people.

1259
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:31,725
Now consider our position.

1260
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:36,771
We know that one day we will be free,

1261
01:41:36,920 --> 01:41:38,888
and we will be the rulers
of our country,

1262
01:41:39,040 --> 01:41:43,443
but do we want to live
in the same hell as you do now?

1263
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:45,841
That would be to lock ourselves back

1264
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:50,289
into prison and our children
and generations after that.

1265
01:41:52,280 --> 01:41:56,080
Gentlemen, look,
I can tell you for nothing,

there will be no revenge.

- [chuckling]

I know that it has been
tough for you, but...

1304
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:10,446
I hear so much these days.

1305
01:45:11,800 --> 01:45:13,689
These boys that you have around you.

1306

- What about them?
- Well, the violence, for one.

1307

- Some of it is necessary, but...
- [laughing]

Hey!

1309
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:25,967
Is that for me?

1310
01:45:26,120 --> 01:45:29,602
No, Khulu.
It is for the white men.

1311
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:35,571
So you are doing that because of
the color of their skin?

1312
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:37,410
Yes, Khulu.

1313
01:45:39,520 --> 01:45:40,407
[sighs]

1314
01:45:40,600 --> 01:45:46,084
That is what they do to us,
and we must do better.

1315

- Understand?
- Yes, Khulu.

1316
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:52,846
Come.
Come on.

1317
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:56,800
These are my grandsons,

1318
01:45:56,960 --> 01:46:00,282
and they would like to meet you.

1319
01:46:00,440 --> 01:46:01,441
Look at him.

1320
01:46:04,600 --> 01:46:08,685
- [Swart] I'll do that.
- No, no, I want to do it.

1321
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:10,450
Let Nelson do it, Swart.

1322

<i>[Gregory over speaker]
Swart, you can stop.</i>

<i>You know that Winnie can stay overnight</i>

1324
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:18,929
<i>any time that you want.</i>

1325
01:46:19,080 --> 01:46:23,165
Yes, but she won't.
This is still a prison.

1326
01:46:24,240 --> 01:46:26,527
She can't pretend that I'm a free man.

1327
01:46:26,680 --> 01:46:28,250
Maybe.

1328
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:32,126
But she's still your wife.

1329
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:35,927
Well, I was married in 1958,

1330
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:39,323
arrested in '62.

1331
01:46:39,480 --> 01:46:42,211
I didn't touch her again until '84.

1332
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:45,564
Is she still my wife?

1333
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:50,962
<i>[Gregory] I've seen you with her
and the way you look at her photograph.</i>

<i>You love her.</i>

1335

<i>[Mandela] This is very true, my friend.

<i>But I love her as she was.</i>

1337

The first step
to regaining the confidence

1338
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:15,249
of the markets is your release,

1339
01:47:15,400 --> 01:47:17,721
and then, of course,
the release of your colleagues.

1340
01:47:17,880 --> 01:47:19,120
We've briefed the president.

1341
01:47:19,280 --> 01:47:21,282
He's a pragmatist;
he heard us.

1342
01:47:21,440 --> 01:47:26,241
The government agrees to lift the ban
on the ANC and repeal the race laws.

1343
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:29,768
You undertake to renounce violence.

1344
01:47:29,960 --> 01:47:31,849
No.

1345
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:36,120
- But you said...
- I said nothing.

1346
01:47:36,280 --> 01:47:37,884
I listened.

1347
01:47:38,480 --> 01:47:41,882
But you will withdraw your
demand for majority rule?

1348
01:47:43,160 --> 01:47:44,286
No.

1349
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:48,770
Then what are you giving us
in exchange for what we give you?

1350
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:50,965
Nothing.

1351
01:47:52,640 --> 01:47:55,291
These meetings have been
a complete waste of all our time.

1352
01:47:55,440 --> 01:47:58,683
Well, I wouldn't say
that I've wasted my time.

1353
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:03,086
The president has made up his mind.

1354
01:48:03,240 --> 01:48:04,765
It can't be stopped now.

1355

[sighs]

1356
01:48:13,960 --> 01:48:17,726
The president is a member
of the Gereformeerde Kerk,

1357
01:48:17,880 --> 01:48:19,609
very Calvinist.

1358
01:48:19,800 --> 01:48:24,886
He believes God calls him to do
a special task in a special time.

- Mr. Mandela.
- Mr. President.

May I congratulate you on your election?

Thank you.

1371
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:40,405
You have been called

Unconditionally.

1379
01:50:12,440 --> 01:50:16,968
A car will be ready at 9:00 tomorrow
morning to take you to the airport.

1380
01:50:17,120 --> 01:50:20,203

you directly to Johannesburg

ceremony will take place.

Mr. De Klerk,

1383
01:50:28,040 --> 01:50:31,931
your people have taken away
half of my life

1384
01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:34,242
and returned me an old man

1385
01:50:34,440 --> 01:50:37,330
to a home that has been long abandoned

1386
01:50:37,520 --> 01:50:40,683
and a family that have
grown up without me.

1387
01:50:42,760 --> 01:50:47,084
I don't want you at my side
at that moment.

1388
01:50:48,520 --> 01:50:52,047
I don't want to be told that you
have given me my freedom.

1389
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:56,571
Just open the gate

1390
01:50:56,720 --> 01:50:58,802

Winnie, when you speak in public,

01:58:48,640 --> 01:58:51,689
you must represent

- This has gone too far.
