00:00:41,613 --> 00:00:46,141
.........

5
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:02,912
But I knew Harvey Dent.
I was... his friend.

6
00:01:04,249 --> 00:01:07,010
And it will be a very long time before

7
00:01:07,012 --> 00:01:10,634
Someone inspires us the way he did.

8
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,393
I believed in Harvey Dent.

9
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:37,896
- Dr. Pavel, I’m CIA.
- He wasn’t alone.

10
00:01:37,998 --> 00:01:42,313
- You don’t get to bring friends.
- They are not my friends.

11
00:01:42,414 --> 00:01:46,029
- Don’t worry, no charge for them.
- Why would I want them?

12
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:48,545
They were trying to grab your prize.

13
00:01:48,646 --> 00:01:52,666
They work for the mercenary.
The masked man.

14
00:01:52,848 --> 00:01:55,151
Bane?

15
00:01:55,957 --> 00:01:58,163
Get ’em on board. I’ll call it in.

16
00:02:06,696 --> 00:02:09,034
The flight plan I just filed with the agency

17
00:02:09,124 --> 00:02:12,589
Lists me, my men, and Dr. Pavel here.

18
00:02:12,711 --> 00:02:15,176
But only one of you.

19
00:02:18,464 --> 00:02:23,060
The first one to talk get to stay on my aircraft.

20
00:02:30,103 --> 00:02:33,593
Who paid you to grab Dr. Pavel?

21
00:02:38,676 --> 00:02:42,943
He didn’t fly so good! Who wants to try next?!

22
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:48,396
Tell me about Bane! Why does he wear the mask?!

23
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:52,641
Lot of loyalty for a hired gun!

24
00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:56,084
Or he’s wondering why someone would shoot a man

25
00:02:56,238 --> 00:02:59,875
Before throwing him out of an aeroplane.

26
00:03:03,623 --> 00:03:06,818
At least you can talk.
Who are you?

27
00:03:06,913 --> 00:03:09,746
Who we are does not matter.

28
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:12,890
What matters is our plan.

29
00:03:18,344 --> 00:03:22,673
And no one cared
who I was until I put on the mask...

30
00:03:23,278 --> 00:03:27,899
- If I pull this off, will you die?
- It would be extremely painful.

31
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,711
- You’re a big guy
- ... for you.

32
00:03:34,336 --> 00:03:36,839
Was being caught part of your plan?

33
00:03:36,939 --> 00:03:38,943
Of course.

34
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,774
Dr. Pavel refused our offer in favor of yours.

35
00:03:46,883 --> 00:03:48,681
We had to know what he told you

36
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:51,517
Nothing! I said nothing!

37
00:04:03,896 --> 00:04:07,342
Well congratulations, you got yourselves caught.

38
00:04:07,345 --> 00:04:08,205
Sir...

39
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:11,104
What’s the next step of your master plan?

40
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,017
Crashing this plane...

41
00:04:19,112 --> 00:04:20,950
With no survivors.

42
00:04:43,695 --> 00:04:45,323
Mayday! Mayday!

43
00:05:52,635 --> 00:05:53,705
No!

44
00:05:53,784 --> 00:05:56,598
They expect one of us in the wreckage. Brother

45
00:05:57,884 --> 00:06:02,923
- Have we started the fire?
- The fire rises.

46
00:06:11,942 --> 00:06:15,776
Calm down, doctor.
Now this is not the time for fear.

47
00:06:16,351 --> 00:06:18,429
That comes later.

48
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:48,684
Harvey Dent day may not be our oldest public holiday...

49
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:51,924
But we’re here tonight because it’s
one of the most important...

50
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:56,149
Harvey Dent’s uncompromising stand
against organized crime

51
00:06:56,245 --> 00:06:59,631
Have made Gotham a safer place than it
was at the time of his death,

52
00:06:59,632 --> 00:07:00,540
Eight years ago...

53
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:03,551
This city has seen a historic
turnaround.

54
00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:06,148
No city is without crime.

55
00:07:06,151 --> 00:07:08,282
But this city is without organized crime

56
00:07:08,382 --> 00:07:12,915
Because the Dent act gave law enforcement teeth in
its fight against the mob.

57
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:16,604
Now people are talking
about repealing the Dent act.

58
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:20,549
And to them I say... not on my watch.

59
00:07:21,443 --> 00:07:24,046
I want to thank the Wayne
foundation for hosting this event.

60
00:07:24,154 --> 00:07:26,554
I’m told Mr. Wayne couldn’t be here tonight,

61
00:07:26,645 --> 00:07:28,428
But I’m sure he’s with us in spirit...

62
00:07:28,534 --> 00:07:31,312
Now I’m going to give way to an important voice...

63
00:07:31,512 --> 00:07:33,758
Ever lay eyes on Wayne at one of these things?

64
00:07:33,852 --> 00:07:35,823
No one has. Not in years.

65
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,977
That people put their faith in a
murderous thug in a mask and a cape.

66
00:07:40,073 --> 00:07:43,527
A thug who showed his true nature

67
00:07:43,528 --> 00:07:49,237
When he betrayed the trust of this
great man and murdered him in cold blood.

68
00:07:49,568 --> 00:07:51,993
Sweetheart, not so fast with the chow.

69
00:07:51,995 --> 00:07:52,801
Shrimp balls?

70
00:07:52,898 --> 00:07:55,316
Jim Gordon can tell you the truth
about Harvey Dent...

71
00:07:55,318 --> 00:07:55,921
Thank you.

72
00:07:56,005 --> 00:07:59,553
Let him tell you himself.
Commissioner Gordon!

73
00:08:08,943 --> 00:08:11,291
The truth...?

74
00:08:15,158 --> 00:08:24,573
I have written a speech telling the
truth about Harvey Dent...

75
00:08:28,225 --> 00:08:31,558
Maybe the time isn’t right...

76
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:37,150
Maybe right now

77
00:08:37,263 --> 00:08:39,350
All you need to know is that

78
00:08:39,351 --> 00:08:42,743
There are a thousand
inmates in Blackgate prison

79
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,997
As a direct result of the Dent act.

80
00:08:45,096 --> 00:08:50,005
These are violent criminals, essential cogs in the
organized crime machine that terrorized Gotham for so long.

81
00:08:50,057 --> 00:08:55,544
Maybe, for now, all I should say
about Harvey Dent’s death is this...

82
00:08:59,263 --> 00:09:02,147
It has not been for nothing.

83
00:09:02,877 --> 00:09:04,444
Did you see the guy who owns the house?

84
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:06,748
They say he never leaves the east wing.

85
00:09:06,845 --> 00:09:10,509
I heard he had an accident... That he’s disfigured.

86
00:09:10,615 --> 00:09:16,591
Mr. Till, why are your people using the main stairs?

87
00:09:17,006 --> 00:09:21,492
- Where’s Mrs. Bolton?
- She’s up at the bar, sir. Can I help?

88
00:09:21,931 --> 00:09:23,265
The east drawing room.

89
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:25,699
Unlock the door, place the tray on the table,

90
00:09:25,702 --> 00:09:27,151
Lock the door again.

91
00:09:27,246 --> 00:09:28,454
Nothing more.

92
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:35,226
I’m sorry, miss Tate, but I’ve tried.
He won’t see you.

93
00:09:35,323 --> 00:09:37,394
Don’t take it personally, Miranda.

94
00:09:37,475 --> 00:09:40,204
Everyone knows Wayne’s holed up in there

95
00:09:40,285 --> 00:09:43,224
With eight-Inch nails, peeing  into mason jars.

96
00:09:43,315 --> 00:09:45,744
Good of you to let me on the grounds.

97
00:09:58,158 --> 00:10:00,955
Why waste your time talking to the man

98
00:10:00,957 --> 00:10:03,618
Who threw away your investment

99
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,416
On some save-The-World vanity project?

100
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:09,017
He can’t help you get your money back. But I can.

101
00:10:09,147 --> 00:10:12,450
I could try explaining that the save the world project,

102
00:10:12,605 --> 00:10:16,401
Vain or not, is worth investing in, Mr. Daggett.

103
00:10:16,525 --> 00:10:19,943
But you understand only money
and the power you think it buys,

104
00:10:20,058 --> 00:10:23,485
So why waste my time, indeed?

105
00:10:23,599 --> 00:10:25,171
The second shift reports in?

106
00:10:25,266 --> 00:10:27,813
But you should put in some more time with the mayor

107
00:10:27,815 --> 00:10:29,531
That’s your department.

108
00:10:29,855 --> 00:10:31,974
Anyone shown him the crime stats?

109
00:10:31,977 --> 00:10:33,147
He goes by his gut,

110
00:10:33,249 --> 00:10:35,464
And it continues to bother him, whatever the numbers.

111
00:10:35,565 --> 00:10:36,971
Must be popular with the wife.

112
00:10:37,073 --> 00:10:39,595
Not really. She took the kids and moved to Cleveland.

113
00:10:39,696 --> 00:10:41,310
He’ll have plenty of time for visits.

114
00:10:41,412 --> 00:10:43,616
Mayor’s dumping him in the spring.

115
00:10:44,118 --> 00:10:46,825
Really? He’s a hero.

116
00:10:46,928 --> 00:10:49,533
War hero. This is peacetime.

117
00:11:20,168 --> 00:11:21,805
I’m... sorry

118
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,756
I’m terribly sorry, Mr. Wayne.

119
00:11:25,947 --> 00:11:28,450
It is Mr. Wayne, isn’t it?

120
00:11:29,295 --> 00:11:35,669
Although you don’t have the long nails... or facial scars...

121
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,938
Is that what they say about me?

122
00:11:39,052 --> 00:11:42,342
It’s just that... nobody sees you...

123
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:43,879
That’s a beautiful necklace.

124
00:11:43,882 --> 00:11:46,434
Reminds me of the one that belonged to my mother.

125
00:11:46,544 --> 00:11:49,180
It can’t be the same one

126
00:11:49,903 --> 00:11:53,747
Her pearls are in this safe

127
00:11:54,591 --> 00:12:01,623
Which the manufacturer clearly
explained is uncrackable.

128
00:12:09,222 --> 00:12:12,450
Oops. No one told me it was uncrackable.

129
00:12:12,597 --> 00:12:15,948
I’m afraid I can’t let you take those.

130
00:12:16,251 --> 00:12:18,327
Look, you wouldn’t hit a woman

131
00:12:18,328 --> 00:12:20,699
Any more than I would beat up a cripple.

132
00:12:21,417 --> 00:12:24,859
Of course, sometimes exceptions have to be made.

133
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:32,441
Good night, Mr. Wayne!

134
00:12:47,227 --> 00:12:51,171
- Can I have a ride?
- You read my mind.

135
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,223
Let's go!

136
00:12:53,364 --> 00:12:55,569
Miss Tate was asking to see you again.

137
00:12:55,682 --> 00:12:58,888
- She’s very persistent.
- And quite lovely,

138
00:12:58,918 --> 00:13:01,128
- In case you were wondering.
- I wasn't.

139
00:13:01,227 --> 00:13:03,985
- What are you doing?
- Examining print dust.

140
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,767
We’ve been robbed.

141
00:13:05,845 --> 00:13:09,025
And this is your idea of raising the alarm?

142
00:13:09,137 --> 00:13:11,249
She took the pearls. Tracking device and all.

143
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,865
- She?
- One of the maids,

144
00:13:12,961 --> 00:13:14,880
Perhaps you should stop letting
them in this side of the house.

145
00:13:14,932 --> 00:13:18,434
Perhaps you should learn to make your own bed, then.

146
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:24,641
- Why are you dusting for prints?
- I’m not. She was.

147
00:13:27,701 --> 00:13:30,526
Sir! Congressman Gilly’s wife’s been calling.

148
00:13:30,527 --> 00:13:33,219
In apparently the Congressman never made it home

149
00:13:33,221 --> 00:13:35,491
from the Wayne foundation event.

150
00:13:35,582 --> 00:13:37,506
That’s a job for the police?

151
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:40,236
When you and Dent cleaned the streets you cleaned ’em good.

152
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:45,402
Pretty soon we’ll be chasing overdue library books.

153
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:51,529
Yet here you are. Like we’re still at war...

154
00:13:52,099 --> 00:13:54,359
- What's your name, son?
- Blake, sir.

155
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:58,175
You have something you want to ask me, officer Blake?

156
00:13:58,361 --> 00:14:02,102
It’s that night. This night, eight
years ago. The night Dent died.

157
00:14:02,204 --> 00:14:04,622
The last confirmed sighting of the Batman.

158
00:14:04,729 --> 00:14:07,391
He murders those people, takes out two swat teams,

159
00:14:07,535 --> 00:14:11,740
Breaks Dent’s neck... then just vanishes?

160
00:14:11,849 --> 00:14:14,306
I’m not hearing a question, son.

161
00:14:14,402 --> 00:14:16,892
Don’t you want to know who we was?

162
00:14:17,007 --> 00:14:20,387
I know exactly who he was.

163
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,427
He was Batman.

164
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:29,032
Let’s go see about the Congressman’s wife...

165
00:14:37,338 --> 00:14:39,587
Master Wayne!

166
00:14:40,675 --> 00:14:43,245
Master Wayne!

167
00:15:13,636 --> 00:15:15,815
You haven’t been down here in a long time...

168
00:15:15,911 --> 00:15:18,512
Just trying to find out more about our jewel thief.

169
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:19,973
I ran her prints

170
00:15:20,081 --> 00:15:22,021
Unless she loss a lot of weight,

171
00:15:22,163 --> 00:15:25,484
But she was wearing someone else’s fingerprints.

172
00:15:25,596 --> 00:15:26,758
She’s good.

173
00:15:26,868 --> 00:15:30,100
She may be. But we have the trace on the necklace.

174
00:15:30,194 --> 00:15:33,092
We do, so I cross-Referenced the address she went back to

175
00:15:33,192 --> 00:15:36,029
With police data on
high-End b- And-E’s...

176
00:15:36,154 --> 00:15:39,129
Selina kyle.

177
00:15:39,431 --> 00:15:44,635
The databases are full of close calls, tips from fences...

178
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:48,566
She’s good, but the ground is shrinking beneath her feet.

179
00:15:48,658 --> 00:15:51,349
We should send the police before she fences the pearls.

180
00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:55,897
She won’t. She likes them too much.
And they weren’t what she was after.

181
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:58,086
- What was she after?
- My fingerprints.

182
00:15:58,193 --> 00:16:01,325
There was printer toner mixed with graphite on the safe.

183
00:16:01,438 --> 00:16:04,042
Gives you a good pull, and it’s untraceable

184
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,997
Fascinating. Maybe you should
exchange notes over coffee.

185
00:16:07,113 --> 00:16:09,084
Now you’re trying to set me up with a jewel thief?

186
00:16:09,189 --> 00:16:11,249
At this point, sir, I would set you up with a chimpanzee

187
00:16:11,362 --> 00:16:14,064
If I thought it would bring
you back into the world.

188
00:16:14,154 --> 00:16:18,218
- There’s nothing out there for me.
- And that's the problem.

189
00:16:18,326 --> 00:16:19,654
You hung up the cape and cowl, but didn't moved on.

190
00:16:19,695 --> 00:16:21,029
You won’t get out there and find a life. To find someone

191
00:16:21,075 --> 00:16:22,072
Alfred...

192
00:16:22,118 --> 00:16:23,146
Did find someone

193
00:16:23,194 --> 00:16:24,939
I know. And then you lost them.
That’s part of living, sir.

194
00:16:24,987 --> 00:16:26,254
But you’re not living... You’re waiting.

195
00:16:26,256 --> 00:16:27,148
Hoping for things to go bad again.

196
00:16:27,173 --> 00:16:28,663
Remember when you left Gotham?

197
00:16:28,777 --> 00:16:31,647
Before all this. Before Batman.

198
00:16:31,789 --> 00:16:33,702
You've been gone for seven years.

199
00:16:33,805 --> 00:16:38,439
Seven years I waited. Hoping that you wouldn’t come back.

200
00:16:38,518 --> 00:16:40,862
Every year, I took a holiday.

201
00:16:40,975 --> 00:16:44,594
Every year I took my holiday.
I’d go to Florence. There’s a café by the Arno...

202
00:16:44,706 --> 00:16:48,593
Every fine evening, I’ll sit there and ordered a fernet branca.

203
00:16:48,873 --> 00:16:51,657
I had this fantasy..

204
00:16:52,204 --> 00:16:57,702
That one day I’d look across the tables, and see you there

205
00:16:57,799 --> 00:17:02,246
Sitting there with your wife. Perhaps some kids.

206
00:17:03,069 --> 00:17:07,887
You wouldn’t say anything to me, or me to you,

207
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:14,926
But we’d both know... that you’d made it.
That you were happy.

208
00:17:17,481 --> 00:17:22,107
I never wanted you to come back to Gotham.

209
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:24,567
I knew there was nothing there for you

210
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:27,133
But pain and tragedy,

211
00:17:27,233 --> 00:17:31,355
And I wanted more for you than that.

212
00:17:34,964 --> 00:17:37,483
I still do.

213
00:17:40,704 --> 00:17:43,419
They wash up a couple times a month.

214
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:45,228
More when it gets colder

215
00:17:45,328 --> 00:17:47,232
Homeless sheltering in the tunnels.

216
00:17:48,937 --> 00:17:53,363
We had to pull him from the basin, but
other than that we didn’t touch him...

217
00:17:55,438 --> 00:17:56,639
What?

218
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,773
Name’s Jimmy. He’s at st. Swithin’s.

219
00:17:59,073 --> 00:18:03,244
The boys home where I... I coach some ball.

220
00:18:06,113 --> 00:18:07,824
Jimmy hadn’t been here for months.

221
00:18:07,925 --> 00:18:10,041
- No, why?
- Blake, you know why.

222
00:18:10,144 --> 00:18:11,659
He aged out.

223
00:18:11,761 --> 00:18:14,582
We don't have the resources to keep the boys on after 16.

224
00:18:14,683 --> 00:18:16,895
I thought the Wayne foundation gave money for them.

225
00:18:16,996 --> 00:18:18,706
Not for the past couple of years.

226
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:23,231
- He has a brother here, doesn't he?
- Mark. I'll tell him.

227
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:26,147
I'd like to. If that's alright.

228
00:18:27,254 --> 00:18:29,567
What was he doing in the tunnels?

229
00:18:29,667 --> 00:18:33,085
Lot of guys been going down the tunnels when they age out.

230
00:18:35,577 --> 00:18:40,219
Say you can live down there.
Say there’s work down there.

231
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,932
Work?

232
00:18:42,034 --> 00:18:44,754
What kind of work are you gonna find in the sewers?

233
00:18:44,856 --> 00:18:48,273
More than you can find up here, I guess.

234
00:18:48,475 --> 00:18:51,276
- So you know about him.
- Of course.

235
00:18:52,684 --> 00:18:55,698
Do you think he's coming back?

236
00:18:56,785 --> 00:18:59,410
I don't know...

237
00:19:11,904 --> 00:19:13,711
You brought a date?

238
00:19:13,911 --> 00:19:17,432
I like having someone around to open doors for me.

239
00:19:17,735 --> 00:19:21,364
Right hand. No partials.

240
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:27,596
Very nice!

241
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:33,023
Not so fast, handsome. You got something for me?

242
00:19:33,528 --> 00:19:35,438
Oh yes.

243
00:19:44,606 --> 00:19:47,622
I don’t know what you’re going to do with Mr. Wayne’s prints...

244
00:19:47,723 --> 00:19:51,545
But I’m guessing you’ll need his thumb.

245
00:19:51,645 --> 00:19:55,464
- You don’t count so good, huh?
- I count fine.

246
00:19:55,565 --> 00:19:59,284
In fact, I’m counting to 10 right now.

247
00:20:01,295 --> 00:20:03,313
Okay...

248
00:20:06,386 --> 00:20:09,502
My friend is waiting outside. Just hit ’send’...

249
00:20:20,945 --> 00:20:25,510
- Place is a little dead.
- It’ll liven up in a minute, trust me.

250
00:20:27,211 --> 00:20:28,415
Is everything okay?

251
00:20:28,515 --> 00:20:30,820
Great. Catch you later.

252
00:20:37,258 --> 00:20:42,180
It would’ve been a lot easier to just give me what we agreed.

253
00:20:42,281 --> 00:20:44,198
We can’t have loose ends.

254
00:20:44,401 --> 00:20:48,927
And even in that dress, no one’s going to miss you.

255
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:52,451
No. But my friend over there...?

256
00:20:52,513 --> 00:20:55,862
Every cop in the city’s missing him.

257
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:00,339
Cute. But they’re not gonna be looking in a place like this.

258
00:21:00,421 --> 00:21:04,905
I don’t know... you did just use his cell phone.

259
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:33,536
Police! Get down now!

260
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,983
Help me!

261
00:21:49,979 --> 00:21:52,224
Keep some pressure on that, sweetheart.

262
00:21:55,036 --> 00:21:56,357
Call me?

263
00:21:59,181 --> 00:22:02,052
- Careful, miss.
- He's bleeding! You gotta help him!

264
00:22:06,774 --> 00:22:08,180
I've got the Congressman.

265
00:22:37,157 --> 00:22:38,766
There!

266
00:22:42,687 --> 00:22:46,797
Manhole! Get this out.
Get the DWP down here, now!

267
00:22:47,548 --> 00:22:49,272
You three, down with me.

268
00:22:49,354 --> 00:22:53,249
You two, head down to cover the next exit

269
00:23:09,455 --> 00:23:11,635
What? He went down there?

270
00:23:42,432 --> 00:23:45,462
- We're going down there, right?
- That was a gas explosion, kid.

271
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:46,981
Gas? This is a sewer!

272
00:23:47,091 --> 00:23:49,145
No one goes in there till we know what’s down there.

273
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:51,101
We know what’s down there, sir.
The police commissioner!

274
00:23:51,201 --> 00:23:53,163
Somebody get the hothead out of here.

275
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:56,481
Where’s the DWP guy?

276
00:24:38,521 --> 00:24:40,970
Why are you here?

277
00:24:41,968 --> 00:24:44,342
Answer him!

278
00:24:45,387 --> 00:24:47,850
I was asking you.

279
00:24:47,962 --> 00:24:50,658
It’s the police commissioner.

280
00:24:53,216 --> 00:24:57,728
- And you brought him down here?
- We didn't know what to do.

281
00:24:57,853 --> 00:24:59,510
- We just thought...
- You panicked.

282
00:24:59,643 --> 00:25:02,527
And your weakness cost the lives of three others.

283
00:25:02,652 --> 00:25:05,161
No, he’s alone

284
00:25:07,838 --> 00:25:11,758
Search him. Then I’ll kill you.

285
00:25:40,357 --> 00:25:41,816
He's dead!

286
00:25:41,927 --> 00:25:43,716
So show me his body!

287
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:46,019
That water runs to any one of the outflows

288
00:25:46,146 --> 00:25:48,118
We’d never find him.

289
00:25:53,024 --> 00:25:56,609
- Follow him.
- Follow him?

290
00:26:11,343 --> 00:26:13,386
Detective! Detective! Hey!

291
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:16,038
You awake?

292
00:26:21,727 --> 00:26:23,133
I need to see Bruce Wayne.

293
00:26:23,234 --> 00:26:25,849
I'm sorry, Mr. Wayne doesn't take unscheduled calls,

294
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:28,061
Even from a police officer.

295
00:26:28,162 --> 00:26:31,682
And if I go get a warrant,
in the investigation of Harvey Dent’s murder?

296
00:26:31,783 --> 00:26:34,497
Would that still count as unscheduled?

297
00:26:38,377 --> 00:26:40,855
What can I do for you, officer?

298
00:26:40,936 --> 00:26:43,726
Commissioner Gordon’s been shot.

299
00:26:45,262 --> 00:26:47,422
He chased a gunman down into the sewers.

300
00:26:47,528 --> 00:26:50,894
When I pulled him out he was
babbling about an underground army.

301
00:26:50,987 --> 00:26:53,670
A masked man called ’Bane’.

302
00:26:53,763 --> 00:26:55,986
Shouldn’t you be telling this to your superior officers?

303
00:26:56,086 --> 00:26:59,648
They asked if he saw
any giant alligators.

304
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:02,454
He needs you.

305
00:27:02,989 --> 00:27:05,559
He needs the Batman.

306
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:07,728
If commissioner Gordon thinks

307
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:10,423
He doesn’t know or care who you are.

308
00:27:10,539 --> 00:27:13,767
But we’ve met before.

309
00:27:13,876 --> 00:27:18,539
There was a long ago,
I was a kid at st. Swithin's...

310
00:27:18,709 --> 00:27:21,032
Used to be funded
by the Wayne foundation.

311
00:27:21,033 --> 00:27:22,192
It's an orphanage.

312
00:27:23,296 --> 00:27:25,810
My mom died when I was small.
Car accident,

313
00:27:25,912 --> 00:27:27,519
I don’t really remember it.

314
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,409
But a couple of years later my dad was shot

315
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,547
Over a gambling debt.

316
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:37,503
I remember that just fine.

317
00:27:38,145 --> 00:27:46,564
Not a lot of people who what it feels
like, do they? To be angry. In your bones.

318
00:27:48,323 --> 00:27:52,581
I mean they understand.
The fosters parents.

319
00:27:52,583 --> 00:27:54,988
Everybody understands...

320
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,983
...for a while.

321
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:01,610
Then they expect the angry kid to do what
he knows he can never do.

322
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:03,495
Move on.

323
00:28:03,608 --> 00:28:05,706
After a while they stop understanding.

324
00:28:05,831 --> 00:28:07,605
They send the angry little
kid to a boy's school.

325
00:28:07,731 --> 00:28:09,440
I figured it out too late.

326
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:15,481
You got to learn to hide the anger,
practice smiling in the mirror.

327
00:28:16,185 --> 00:28:18,966
It's like putting on a mask.

328
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:22,919
You showed up one day in a cool car,

329
00:28:22,922 --> 00:28:25,149
Pretty girl on your arm.

330
00:28:25,306 --> 00:28:31,130
We were so excited - Bruce Wayne,
billionaire orphan.

331
00:28:31,242 --> 00:28:34,779
We made up stories about you. Legends.

332
00:28:34,886 --> 00:28:37,618
And you know the other kids,
that's all it was, it's just stories.

333
00:28:40,482 --> 00:28:44,122
But when I saw you,
I knew who you really were.

334
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:48,024
I seen that look on your face before.

335
00:28:48,121 --> 00:28:51,290
Same one I taught myself.

336
00:28:52,278 --> 00:28:55,404
I don’t know why you took the fall for Dent’s murder,

337
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,817
But I’m still a believer in the Batman.

338
00:28:58,914 --> 00:29:02,117
Even if you’re not.

339
00:29:03,246 --> 00:29:05,683
Why did you say your boys’ home

340
00:29:05,685 --> 00:29:08,517
Used to be funded by the Wayne foundation?

341
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,375
Because the money stopped.

342
00:29:10,465 --> 00:29:12,438
Might be time to get some fresh air

343
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,152
And start paying attention to the details.

344
00:29:15,537 --> 00:29:18,982
Some of those details might need your help.

345
00:29:19,836 --> 00:29:21,320
You checked that name? ’Bane’

346
00:29:21,433 --> 00:29:23,727
He’s a mercenary. No other known name.

347
00:29:23,855 --> 00:29:26,689
He and his men were
behind a coup in west Africa

348
00:29:26,782 --> 00:29:31,799
That secured mining operations
for our friend John Daggett

349
00:29:31,941 --> 00:29:34,785
- Now Doggett’s brought them here?
- It would seem so.

350
00:29:36,742 --> 00:29:39,470
- I’ll keep digging.
- Yeah.

351
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:42,818
Alfred, why did the Wayne foundation

352
00:29:42,821 --> 00:29:46,229
Stopped funding the boy's home in the city?

353
00:29:46,431 --> 00:29:51,848
The foundation is funded by the
profits of Wayne enterprises.

354
00:29:51,948 --> 00:29:53,761
There have to be some...

355
00:29:53,808 --> 00:29:56,201
Time to talk to Mr. Fox I think.

356
00:29:56,205 --> 00:29:58,012
I'll get him on the phone.

357
00:29:58,013 --> 00:30:01,417
No. Do we still have any cars around the place?

358
00:30:01,437 --> 00:30:03,473
Yes, one or two

359
00:30:03,566 --> 00:30:05,693
And I need an appointment at the hospital.
About my leg.

360
00:30:05,785 --> 00:30:09,292
- Which hospital?
- Whichever one Jim Gordon’s in.

361
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,189
I’ve seen worse cartilage in knees

362
00:30:15,269 --> 00:30:16,399
- That’s good
- No.

363
00:30:16,504 --> 00:30:19,119
That’s because there is no cartilage in your knee.

364
00:30:19,121 --> 00:30:22,154
And not much of any use in your elbows and shoulders.

365
00:30:22,248 --> 00:30:24,650
Between that and the scar tissue on your kidneys,

366
00:30:24,653 --> 00:30:27,161
Residual concussive damage to your brain tissue

367
00:30:27,271 --> 00:30:29,908
And general scarred-Over quality of your body...

368
00:30:29,948 --> 00:30:32,360
I cannot recommend that you go heli-Skiing.

369
00:30:32,473 --> 00:30:34,856
Right.

370
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:55,142
We were in this together.
Then you were gone...

371
00:30:55,243 --> 00:30:58,570
The Batman wasn’t needed anymore.
We won.

372
00:30:58,671 --> 00:31:01,903
Built on a lie. Our lie.

373
00:31:02,005 --> 00:31:08,137
Now there’s evil rising from where we tried to bury it.

374
00:31:08,238 --> 00:31:12,460
The Batman has to come back.

375
00:31:12,965 --> 00:31:15,580
What if he doesn’t exist anymore?

376
00:31:15,681 --> 00:31:22,104
He must. You...

377
00:31:33,668 --> 00:31:34,971
Goddammit,

378
00:31:35,072 --> 00:31:37,894
- You took my wallet!
- No I didn't!

379
00:31:38,197 --> 00:31:40,809
- Get out!
- She took my wallet...

380
00:31:41,051 --> 00:31:42,339
Now!

381
00:31:43,063 --> 00:31:44,248
Crazy!

382
00:31:44,334 --> 00:31:46,625
I don’t know what he’s so upset
about, he only had 60 bucks in here.

383
00:31:46,722 --> 00:31:49,373
Probably the watch.

384
00:32:03,681 --> 00:32:04,461
Who's that?

385
00:32:04,462 --> 00:32:07,508
Another stiff too old to climb out of his sports car.

386
00:32:07,587 --> 00:32:08,622
Well that's Bruce Wayne!

387
00:32:08,736 --> 00:32:12,028
Bruce Wayne, over here!

388
00:32:15,028 --> 00:32:16,960
- I’m not sure if my assistant put me on the guest list
- Right through here, Mr. Wayne.

389
00:32:17,026 --> 00:32:19,091
Thank you so much.

390
00:32:23,961 --> 00:32:28,313
Bruce Wayne at a charity ball?

391
00:32:28,881 --> 00:32:31,401
Miss Tate, isn’t it?

392
00:32:31,521 --> 00:32:35,162
Even before you became a recluse,
you never came to these things...

393
00:32:35,221 --> 00:32:37,434
Proceeds goes to big fat spread.

394
00:32:37,487 --> 00:32:38,512
This is not about charity.

395
00:32:38,712 --> 00:32:43,411
It’s about feeding the ego of
whichever society hag laid it on.

396
00:32:43,523 --> 00:32:46,298
Actually this is my party, Mr. Wayne.

397
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,222
And the proceeds will go where they should,

398
00:32:50,304 --> 00:32:53,773
Because I paid for the big fat spread myself.

399
00:32:53,974 --> 00:32:55,453
That’s very generous of you.

400
00:32:55,547 --> 00:32:58,907
You have to invest to restore balance to the world.

401
00:32:59,557 --> 00:33:01,801
Take our
clean-Energy project...

402
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:04,577
Sometimes the investment doesn’t pay off.

403
00:33:04,938 --> 00:33:06,202
I'm sorry.

404
00:33:06,295 --> 00:33:08,916
You have a practiced apathy, Mr. Wayne.

405
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:12,275
But a man who doesn’t care about the
world doesn’t spend half his fortune

406
00:33:12,372 --> 00:33:14,537
On a plan to save it...

407
00:33:15,002 --> 00:33:21,595
And isn’t so wounded when it
fails that he goes into hiding...

408
00:33:21,863 --> 00:33:24,498
Have a good evening, Mr. Wayne.

409
00:33:27,912 --> 00:33:29,833
Mind if I cut in?

410
00:33:30,677 --> 00:33:32,369
Thank you.

411
00:33:34,984 --> 00:33:36,917
You don’t seem very happy to see me.

412
00:33:36,993 --> 00:33:40,476
- You were supposed to be a shut-In.
- Felt like some fresh air.

413
00:33:40,616 --> 00:33:43,291
Why didn’t you call the police?

414
00:33:43,402 --> 00:33:46,687
I have a powerful friend who deals
with this kind of thing.

415
00:33:46,793 --> 00:33:51,576
Brazen costume for a
cat burglar.

416
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:57,023
- Yeah? Who are you pretending to be?
- Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire.

417
00:33:57,474 --> 00:34:00,065
- Who’s your date?
- His wife’s in Ibiza.

418
00:34:00,174 --> 00:34:03,989
She left her diamonds behind, though.
Worried they’d get stolen.

419
00:34:04,284 --> 00:34:06,356
It’s pronounced ’’Ibeetha’.

420
00:34:06,527 --> 00:34:09,805
You wouldn’t want these
folks realizing you’re a crook

421
00:34:09,807 --> 00:34:10,637
not a social climber.

422
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:14,466
You think I care what anyone in
this room thinks about me?

423
00:34:15,267 --> 00:34:18,091
I doubt you care what anyone in
this room thinks about you.

424
00:34:18,182 --> 00:34:22,089
Don’t condescend, Mr. Wayne.
You don’t know a thing about me.

425
00:34:22,218 --> 00:34:24,545
Well, Selina kyle,

426
00:34:24,567 --> 00:34:26,761
I know you came here from your walk-Up in old town

427
00:34:26,851 --> 00:34:28,697
Modest place for a master jewel thief.

428
00:34:28,795 --> 00:34:30,985
Which means either you’re saving for your retirement

429
00:34:31,076 --> 00:34:35,542
Or you’re in deep with the wrong people.

430
00:34:36,326 --> 00:34:38,392
You don’t get to judge me because

431
00:34:38,394 --> 00:34:40,614
You were born in the master bedroom of Wayne manor.

432
00:34:40,726 --> 00:34:42,093
Actually, I was born in the regency room.

433
00:34:42,184 --> 00:34:44,772
I started off doing what I had to.

434
00:34:46,116 --> 00:34:47,638
Once you’ve done what you had to

435
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:49,517
They’ll never let you do what you want to.

436
00:34:49,634 --> 00:34:51,339
Start fresh.

437
00:34:51,418 --> 00:34:54,386
There’s no fresh start in today’s world.

438
00:34:54,479 --> 00:34:57,406
Any 12year old with a cell phone
could find out what you did.

439
00:34:57,507 --> 00:35:01,656
Everything we do is collated and quantified.
Everything sticks.

440
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:04,322
Is that how you justify stealing?

441
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:07,036
I take what I need to from those
who have more than enough.

442
00:35:07,131 --> 00:35:09,290
I don’t stand on the shoulders of people with less.

443
00:35:09,402 --> 00:35:10,469
Robin hood?

444
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:13,565
I’d do more to help someone than
most of the people in this room.

445
00:35:13,665 --> 00:35:15,237
Thank you.

446
00:35:16,067 --> 00:35:17,948
Maybe you’re assuming too much.

447
00:35:17,967 --> 00:35:20,462
Or maybe you’re being unrealistic about what’s

448
00:35:20,464 --> 00:35:22,715
really in your pants other than your wallet.

449
00:35:22,716 --> 00:35:23,277
Ouch.

450
00:35:23,763 --> 00:35:25,873
You think all this can last?

451
00:35:25,976 --> 00:35:28,891
There’s a storm coming, Mr. Wayne.

452
00:35:29,496 --> 00:35:32,305
You and your friends better batten down the hatches,

453
00:35:32,407 --> 00:35:34,728
because when it hits you’re all gonna wonder

454
00:35:34,931 --> 00:35:38,415
How you ever thought you could live so large and

455
00:35:38,417 --> 00:35:41,456
Leave so little to the rest of us.

456
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:47,793
Sounds like you’re looking forward to it.

457
00:35:48,397 --> 00:35:50,106
I'm adaptable.

458
00:35:50,207 --> 00:35:52,925
These pearls do look better on you
then they did in my safe...

459
00:35:54,169 --> 00:35:56,928
But I still can’t let you keep them.

460
00:36:03,675 --> 00:36:06,827
You scared her off!

461
00:36:09,152 --> 00:36:11,346
Not likely...

462
00:36:12,932 --> 00:36:14,375
I must have lost my ticket

463
00:36:14,486 --> 00:36:16,592
Your wife said you were taking a cab home, sir.

464
00:36:16,595 --> 00:36:17,119
My wife?

465
00:36:25,069 --> 00:36:27,442
Just you, sir?

466
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,467
Don’t worry, master Wayne.

467
00:36:32,562 --> 00:36:35,720
Takes a little time to get
back into the swing of things.

468
00:36:37,877 --> 00:36:41,686
Bruce Wayne. As I live and breathe.

469
00:36:42,898 --> 00:36:45,632
What brings you out of cryo-Sleep Mr. Wayne?

470
00:36:45,763 --> 00:36:47,269
I see you haven’t lost your sense of humor...

471
00:36:47,374 --> 00:36:49,865
Even if you have lost most of my money.

472
00:36:49,892 --> 00:36:51,598
Actually, you did that yourself.

473
00:36:51,674 --> 00:36:54,532
See, if you funnel the entire R and D budget

474
00:36:54,535 --> 00:36:57,532
Into a fusion project that you then mothball,

475
00:36:57,616 --> 00:36:59,691
Your company is unlikely to thrive.

476
00:36:59,865 --> 00:37:01,430
What’re my options?

477
00:37:01,525 --> 00:37:03,761
If you’re not willing to turn your machine on

478
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,430
I can't. I can't, Lucius.

479
00:37:06,548 --> 00:37:08,570
Then sit tight.

480
00:37:08,661 --> 00:37:10,507
Your majority keeps Daggett at arm’s length

481
00:37:10,615 --> 00:37:15,009
while we figure out a future for the
energy program with Miranda Tate

482
00:37:15,101 --> 00:37:17,964
She’s supported your project all the way.

483
00:37:18,059 --> 00:37:21,530
She’s smart, and quite lovely.

484
00:37:22,263 --> 00:37:25,792
We all just want what's best for you, Bruce.

485
00:37:25,903 --> 00:37:30,202
- Show her the machine.
- I think it over.

486
00:37:30,315 --> 00:37:34,115
- Anything else?
- Nope. Why?

487
00:37:34,205 --> 00:37:38,626
These conversations always used to
end with some... unusual requests.

488
00:37:39,016 --> 00:37:40,979
I retired.

489
00:37:42,284 --> 00:37:44,974
Let me show you some stuff, anyway.

490
00:37:48,863 --> 00:37:50,960
Just for old times' sake.

491
00:37:54,601 --> 00:37:56,991
I figured you’d have shut this place down.

492
00:37:57,058 --> 00:37:59,695
Oh, it was always shut down.
Officially.

493
00:37:59,697 --> 00:38:01,230
But all this new stuff?

494
00:38:01,322 --> 00:38:03,544
After your father died, Wayne enterprises

495
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:06,033
Set up 14 different defense subsidiaries.

496
00:38:06,129 --> 00:38:08,608
I’ve spent years shuttering them and consolidating

497
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:10,841
All the prototypes under one roof.

498
00:38:10,948 --> 00:38:12,923
- My roof.
- Why?

499
00:38:13,066 --> 00:38:15,883
Stop them falling into the wrong hands.

500
00:38:19,065 --> 00:38:21,669
Now you’re just showing off.

501
00:38:22,517 --> 00:38:24,199
Defense department project for

502
00:38:24,356 --> 00:38:27,723
Tight-Geometry urban pacification.

503
00:38:27,804 --> 00:38:30,214
Rotors configured for maneuvering between buildings

504
00:38:30,311 --> 00:38:32,695
without recirculation.

505
00:38:32,855 --> 00:38:34,844
What’s it called?

506
00:38:35,035 --> 00:38:39,381
It has a long and uninteresting
Wayne enterprises designation.

507
00:38:39,471 --> 00:38:42,927
So I took to calling it the bat.

508
00:38:43,638 --> 00:38:46,831
And yes, Mr. Wayne,
it does come in black.

509
00:38:48,171 --> 00:38:51,503
Works great except for the
autopilot.

510
00:38:51,596 --> 00:38:53,700
Take a
better mind than mine to fix it.

511
00:38:53,794 --> 00:38:55,349
A better mind?

512
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:58,704
Well I was trying to be modest.

513
00:38:58,992 --> 00:39:02,820
A less busy mind, yours.

514
00:39:10,187 --> 00:39:11,795
It is terribly painful?

515
00:39:11,896 --> 00:39:13,605
You’re welcome to try it, Alfred.

516
00:39:13,706 --> 00:39:16,723
Happy watching, thank you, sir.

517
00:39:19,051 --> 00:39:20,765
Not bad...

518
00:39:25,177 --> 00:39:27,385
Not bad at all!

519
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:33,519
Master Wayne,
if you’re considering going back out there

520
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:36,043
You need to hear some rumors surrounding Bane.

521
00:39:36,146 --> 00:39:37,853
I'm all ears.

522
00:39:38,055 --> 00:39:41,271
There is a prison.
In a more ancient part of the world.

523
00:39:41,472 --> 00:39:47,397
A pit. Where men are thrown to suffer and die.

524
00:39:47,499 --> 00:39:51,320
But sometimes, a man rises from the darkness.

525
00:39:51,421 --> 00:39:55,544
Sometimes... the pit sends something back.

526
00:39:55,645 --> 00:39:58,057
- Bane!
- Right.

527
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:01,076
Born and raised in a hell on earth.

528
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,268
Born in a prison?

529
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:05,028
No one knows why.
Or how he escaped.

530
00:40:05,126 --> 00:40:12,001
But they know who trained him one he did... Ra’s Al Ghul.
Your mentor.

531
00:40:12,126 --> 00:40:14,556
Bane was a member of the League of Shadows.

532
00:40:14,632 --> 00:40:16,881
And then he was excommunicated.

533
00:40:16,977 --> 00:40:20,748
And any man who is too extreme for Ra's al Ghoul,

534
00:40:20,749 --> 00:40:22,902
Is not to be trifled with.

535
00:40:23,012 --> 00:40:26,657
I didn’t realize I was known for trifling with criminals.

536
00:40:26,762 --> 00:40:28,267
That was then.

537
00:40:28,374 --> 00:40:31,591
And you can strap up
your leg and put the mask back on.

538
00:40:31,694 --> 00:40:33,740
But it won’t make you what you were.

539
00:40:33,851 --> 00:40:38,802
If this man is all the things you say he is,
then this city needs me.

540
00:40:38,911 --> 00:40:44,047
This city needs Bruce Wayne.
Your resources, your knowledge...

541
00:40:44,049 --> 00:40:47,153
Not your body. Not your life.

542
00:40:47,742 --> 00:40:49,212
That time has passed.

543
00:40:49,307 --> 00:40:52,446
That’s what you’re afraid of.
That if I go back out there I’ll fail.

544
00:40:52,541 --> 00:40:54,276
No.

545
00:40:55,444 --> 00:40:59,627
I’m afraid that you want to.

546
00:41:12,509 --> 00:41:15,887
You can’t short the stock because
Bruce Wayne goes to a party

547
00:41:15,987 --> 00:41:17,340
Wayne coming back is change.

548
00:41:17,449 --> 00:41:20,002
- Change is either good or bad.
- I vote bad.

549
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,997
- On what basis?
- I flipped a coin.

550
00:41:29,087 --> 00:41:31,155
No. Rye. I told ’em rye.

551
00:41:33,789 --> 00:41:37,254
Rookie! Lose the helmet! We need faces for cameras.

552
00:41:42,188 --> 00:41:44,356
Come on let's go scalping.

553
00:42:44,857 --> 00:42:47,697
This is a stock exchange,
there’s no money you can steal

554
00:42:47,838 --> 00:42:51,349
Really? Then why are you people here?

555
00:43:15,139 --> 00:43:16,915
You got to get in there!

556
00:43:17,014 --> 00:43:19,975
- It's a hostage situation.
- It’s a robbery!

557
00:43:20,074 --> 00:43:22,254
They’ve got direct
access to the online trading desk.

558
00:43:22,354 --> 00:43:24,722
I’m not risking my men for your money

559
00:43:28,075 --> 00:43:30,440
Sir, you going to ask you to move.
We have a situation here.

560
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:32,603
It’s not our money, it’s everyone’s!

561
00:43:32,695 --> 00:43:34,836
Really? Mine’s in my mattress.

562
00:43:34,957 --> 00:43:36,230
If you don’t shut these guys down,

563
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:39,614
The stuffing in that mattress might
be worth a whole lot less, pal.

564
00:43:39,709 --> 00:43:41,999
Cut the fiber line - Shut down the cell tower.

565
00:43:42,096 --> 00:43:44,170
- Thank you.
- That’ll slow them down.

566
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:51,831
They cut the fiber.

567
00:43:53,095 --> 00:43:56,204
- Cell’s working.
- For now.

568
00:44:01,374 --> 00:44:02,363
Get the barriers up

569
00:44:02,462 --> 00:44:03,215
I want all of them up.

570
00:44:03,216 --> 00:44:04,824
No more in and out on this street!

571
00:44:04,878 --> 00:44:08,164
- Where am I suppose to move it?
- Back it up.

572
00:44:12,389 --> 00:44:14,652
Just stay in your vehicle, okay?

573
00:44:21,169 --> 00:44:24,386
How much longer does the program need?

574
00:44:25,168 --> 00:44:27,136
Eight minutes.

575
00:44:27,803 --> 00:44:29,395
Time to go mobile.

576
00:44:29,434 --> 00:44:30,924
Everybody up!

577
00:44:34,793 --> 00:44:36,423
You two, move!

578
00:44:38,674 --> 00:44:40,598
Thank you.

579
00:44:40,965 --> 00:44:42,255
Steady!

580
00:44:50,675 --> 00:44:52,484
Steady!

581
00:45:00,412 --> 00:45:01,969
I got something!

582
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:10,758
Do not shoot! We've hostages!

583
00:45:10,891 --> 00:45:12,417
Hold your fire!

584
00:45:22,105 --> 00:45:23,619
Go! Go!

585
00:45:33,664 --> 00:45:36,027
Hey, let me go!

586
00:45:36,167 --> 00:45:39,433
Please! Hey!

587
00:45:41,224 --> 00:45:44,292
- Shoot the tires!
- There's no shot.

588
00:45:45,611 --> 00:45:48,807
Now back off! Back off!
They've got hostages!

589
00:45:48,904 --> 00:45:50,975
Police are pursuing the 4 suspects from

590
00:45:50,978 --> 00:45:53,152
Downtown in respond to a hostage situation

591
00:45:53,254 --> 00:45:54,398
Gotham PD...

592
00:46:00,492 --> 00:46:02,408
What’s going on with the lights?

593
00:46:09,316 --> 00:46:11,117
I can't pick up anything!

594
00:46:11,245 --> 00:46:12,273
The hell was that?!

595
00:46:12,403 --> 00:46:15,701
Oh boy. You’re in for a show tonight, son.

596
00:46:20,715 --> 00:46:22,739
Please! Help!

597
00:46:40,909 --> 00:46:42,416
Sorry!

598
00:46:42,517 --> 00:46:45,028
Put that thing away before you hurt yourself.

599
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:45,632
Get in!

600
00:46:45,634 --> 00:46:47,642
Let's go. You, get in the car!

601
00:46:47,744 --> 00:46:49,654
They’ve spotted the Batman!

602
00:47:00,311 --> 00:47:01,317
Call everyone in

603
00:47:01,418 --> 00:47:03,630
Every car patrol, beat cop, off-Duty, too!

604
00:47:03,732 --> 00:47:04,938
Call in now!

605
00:47:05,038 --> 00:47:06,743
I’m gonna do what Gordon never could.

606
00:47:06,844 --> 00:47:09,655
- What's that?
- I'm going to take down the Batman.

607
00:47:11,050 --> 00:47:13,055
.. The 4 suspect are carrying two hostages

608
00:47:13,141 --> 00:47:15,250
That they kidnapped them at
the Gotham stock exchange.

609
00:47:15,378 --> 00:47:17,032
Witnesses reported that...

610
00:47:19,912 --> 00:47:21,346
It seems hard to believe.

611
00:47:21,347 --> 00:47:24,077
But report are suspects
are now being pursued,

612
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,938
What appears to be, the Batman.

613
00:47:26,091 --> 00:47:28,253
Well, what do you know?

614
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:35,913
Sir, what about the armed robbers?

615
00:47:37,108 --> 00:47:40,796
Please! Let me go! Please!

616
00:47:49,786 --> 00:47:50,860
One bike’s pulled off,

617
00:47:50,952 --> 00:47:52,955
No hostage. Shall we pursue?

618
00:47:58,002 --> 00:48:00,064
Negative! Stay on the Batman!

619
00:48:02,253 --> 00:48:04,116
- But he’s getting away!
- Who do you want to catch?

620
00:48:04,206 --> 00:48:07,142
Some robber, or the son of a
bitch who killed Harvey Dent?

621
00:48:16,094 --> 00:48:19,280
After eight years he has to pick tonight...

622
00:48:19,283 --> 00:48:21,844
He’s drawing the cops off Bane...

623
00:48:30,138 --> 00:48:34,354
Please! Just let me go! Please!

624
00:49:08,047 --> 00:49:10,412
Transferring complete

625
00:49:52,651 --> 00:49:53,940
We lost him.

626
00:49:54,045 --> 00:49:55,908
How could you lose him?

627
00:49:56,039 --> 00:49:57,415
He’s got a lot of firepower

628
00:49:57,558 --> 00:49:59,725
And you don’t?!

629
00:50:03,805 --> 00:50:05,712
He’s heading back downtown...

630
00:50:05,778 --> 00:50:07,712
Then he’s as dumb as he dresses -

631
00:50:07,826 --> 00:50:09,809
Close it down, gentlemen!

632
00:50:42,437 --> 00:50:45,151
Like a rat in a trap, gentlemen!

633
00:50:50,149 --> 00:50:53,620
You might have the wrong animal there, sir

634
00:51:04,074 --> 00:51:06,087
Are you sure that was him?

635
00:51:12,507 --> 00:51:16,082
Bane says the Batman interfered,
but the task was accomplished.

636
00:51:16,197 --> 00:51:17,872
What about the men they arrested?

637
00:51:17,999 --> 00:51:22,705
He says, and I quote,
they would die before talking.

638
00:51:23,477 --> 00:51:26,225
Where does he find these guys?

639
00:51:27,331 --> 00:51:29,379
Open the champagne!

640
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:35,708
- And can we get some girls in here?
- Careful what you wish for.

641
00:51:46,197 --> 00:51:49,138
- Cat got your tongue?
- You dumb bitch!

642
00:51:49,245 --> 00:51:51,380
Nobody ever accused me of being dumb.

643
00:51:51,490 --> 00:51:55,035
Dumb to show up here tonight.

644
00:51:55,463 --> 00:51:58,743
I want what you owe me

645
00:51:59,369 --> 00:52:03,512
- ’One’ doesn't gets...
- Nice outfit...

646
00:52:03,607 --> 00:52:05,630
Those heels make it tough to walk?

647
00:52:05,738 --> 00:52:09,527
I don’t know, do they?

648
00:52:10,610 --> 00:52:12,224
- So where is it?
- Where's what?

649
00:52:12,341 --> 00:52:14,721
The program. The ’clean slate’.

650
00:52:14,847 --> 00:52:18,287
Oh, yeah - The ultimate tool for a
master thief with a record.

651
00:52:18,923 --> 00:52:20,459
Hold it right there!

652
00:52:34,048 --> 00:52:37,475
- Where is it?!
- The ’clean slate’?

653
00:52:37,566 --> 00:52:39,534
Type in a name and date of birth

654
00:52:39,583 --> 00:52:44,062
And a few minutes they're gone,
every database on earth.

655
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:46,746
Sounds a little too good to be true?

656
00:52:46,844 --> 00:52:50,734
You’re lying. Rykin data took it to prototype stage

657
00:52:50,862 --> 00:52:52,946
That’s why I bought them.

658
00:52:53,116 --> 00:52:58,230
But they had nothing.
It was a gangland myth.

659
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:10,919
Stay back!

660
00:53:13,709 --> 00:53:15,681
I'm not bluffing!

661
00:53:16,307 --> 00:53:19,947
They know! They just don't care.

662
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:39,774
- You got to be kidding me.
- No guns, no killing.

663
00:53:39,875 --> 00:53:41,424
Where’s the fun in that?

664
00:54:00,232 --> 00:54:02,664
My mother warned me about getting
into cars with strange men

665
00:54:02,759 --> 00:54:04,879
This isn't a car.

666
00:54:54,685 --> 00:54:56,352
See you around!

667
00:54:57,169 --> 00:54:58,651
You're welcome!

668
00:54:58,744 --> 00:55:01,775
- I had it under control.
- Those weren’t street thugs

669
00:55:01,918 --> 00:55:05,451
- They were trained
killers. I saved your life.

670
00:55:05,608 --> 00:55:10,270
In return I need to know what you
did with Bruce Wayne’s fingerprints.

671
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:13,797
Wayne wasn’t kidding about a ’powerful friend’.

672
00:55:13,924 --> 00:55:16,941
I sold his prints to Daggett.

673
00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:20,815
For something that doesn’t even exist.

674
00:55:21,206 --> 00:55:23,148
I doubt many people get the better of you.

675
00:55:23,265 --> 00:55:26,339
- Hey, when a girl’s desperate...
- What were they going to do with them?

676
00:55:26,444 --> 00:55:28,331
I don’t know. But Daggett

677
00:55:28,334 --> 00:55:30,693
Seemed pretty interested in
that mess at the stock market.

678
00:55:36,298 --> 00:55:38,293
Miss kyle...

679
00:55:40,594 --> 00:55:43,292
So that’s what that feels like.

680
00:56:02,276 --> 00:56:04,301
I've seen you in the television coverage,

681
00:56:04,303 --> 00:56:07,002
You seem to have your
taste for wanton destruction back.

682
00:56:07,102 --> 00:56:08,812
I retrieved this.

683
00:56:09,217 --> 00:56:11,744
Shouldn’t the police be gathering the evidence?

684
00:56:11,845 --> 00:56:13,659
They don’t have the tools to analyze it.

685
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:15,369
They would if you gave them to them

686
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:18,076
One man’s tool is another man’s weapon.

687
00:56:18,178 --> 00:56:19,056
In your mind, perhaps.

688
00:56:19,057 --> 00:56:21,400
But there aren’t many things
you couldn’t turn into a weapon.

689
00:56:21,502 --> 00:56:23,515
Alfred. Enough. The police weren’t getting it done

690
00:56:23,617 --> 00:56:26,834
Perhaps they would’ve if you
haven’t made a sideshow of yourself.

691
00:56:27,037 --> 00:56:28,445
You thought I didn’t have it in me.

692
00:56:28,545 --> 00:56:30,757
You don’t. You lead a bloated
police force on a merry chase

693
00:56:30,858 --> 00:56:34,075
with some fancy new toys from fox.

694
00:56:34,177 --> 00:56:35,887
What about when you come up against him.

695
00:56:35,987 --> 00:56:37,091
What then?

696
00:56:37,191 --> 00:56:38,290
I’ll fight harder, I always have.

697
00:56:38,393 --> 00:56:42,211
Take a good look. At his speed,
his ferocity, his training.

698
00:56:42,312 --> 00:56:44,833
I see the power of belief.

699
00:56:44,935 --> 00:56:48,039
See the League of Shadows resurgent.

700
00:56:48,139 --> 00:56:51,758
- You said he was excommunicated.
- By Ra's al Ghoul.

701
00:56:51,857 --> 00:56:54,069
Who leads them now?

702
00:56:54,172 --> 00:56:56,484
Ra's al Ghoul was the league
of shadows and I beat him.

703
00:56:56,585 --> 00:56:59,400
Bane is just a mercenary,
we need to find out what he's up to.

704
00:57:00,772 --> 00:57:04,102
Trades of some kind. Coded...

705
00:57:04,192 --> 00:57:07,132
And my fingerprints courtesy of Selina kyle.

706
00:57:07,231 --> 00:57:08,248
Get this to fox

707
00:57:08,356 --> 00:57:09,730
He can crack the code

708
00:57:09,732 --> 00:57:12,811
And tell us what trades they were executing.

709
00:57:16,546 --> 00:57:20,181
I’ll get this to fox. But no more.

710
00:57:21,808 --> 00:57:25,634
I’ve sewn you up and set your bones...
but I won’t bury you.

711
00:57:25,728 --> 00:57:29,705
I’ve buried enough members of the Wayne family.

712
00:57:29,802 --> 00:57:30,897
You leave me?

713
00:57:30,987 --> 00:57:34,956
You see only one end to your journey.

714
00:57:35,383 --> 00:57:39,962
Leaving is all I have to make you understand:

715
00:57:40,197 --> 00:57:43,824
You aren’t Batman anymore
You have to find another way.

716
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:48,354
You used to talk about finishing.
About life beyond that awful cave

717
00:57:48,448 --> 00:57:52,051
Rachel died knowing we’d decided to be together.

718
00:57:52,146 --> 00:57:53,795
That was my life beyond this cave

719
00:57:53,894 --> 00:57:56,480
And I can’t just move on.

720
00:57:56,590 --> 00:58:00,148
She didn’t. She couldn’t.

721
00:58:00,195 --> 00:58:03,423
- What if he had?
- She was, I can’t change that

722
00:58:03,523 --> 00:58:06,589
What if, before she died, she’d written a letter?

723
00:58:06,679 --> 00:58:11,104
Saying she’d chosen Harvey Dent over you?

724
00:58:14,370 --> 00:58:19,182
And what if, to spare you pain...

725
00:58:20,517 --> 00:58:23,347
I’d burned that letter?

726
00:58:23,584 --> 00:58:27,848
How dare you use Rachel to stop me!

727
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:31,110
I’m using the truth, master Wayne.

728
00:58:31,845 --> 00:58:34,462
Maybe it’s time we all stopped
trying to outsmart the truth

729
00:58:34,571 --> 00:58:38,030
And just let it have its day.

730
00:58:38,235 --> 00:58:40,508
- I’m sorry.
- You're sorry?

731
00:58:40,625 --> 00:58:44,106
You expect to destroy my world,

732
00:58:45,503 --> 00:58:48,623
...and then think we're going to shake hands?

733
00:58:48,729 --> 00:58:50,754
No.

734
00:58:50,870 --> 00:58:54,770
- I know what this means
- What does it mean?!

735
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:59,573
It means your hatred.
It means losing the person

736
00:58:59,575 --> 00:59:02,921
I’ve cared for ever since I heard

737
00:59:03,043 --> 00:59:08,718
His first cries echo through this house.

738
00:59:08,968 --> 00:59:14,144
But it might also mean saving your life.

739
00:59:14,364 --> 00:59:18,128
And that is more important.

740
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:24,592
Good bye, Alfred!

741
00:59:43,189 --> 00:59:45,629
Alfred?

742
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:51,941
- Answering your own door?
- Yeah.

743
00:59:53,418 --> 00:59:55,219
Page three.

744
00:59:55,343 --> 00:59:59,534
It seems you made a series of large
put options on the futures exchange.

745
00:59:59,641 --> 01:00:01,179
Verified by thumb print.

746
01:00:01,290 --> 01:00:03,771
The options expired at midnight last night.

747
01:00:03,876 --> 01:00:07,190
Long term we may be able to prove
fraud, but for now...

748
01:00:07,191 --> 01:00:08,643
You’re completely broke.

749
01:00:08,803 --> 01:00:12,535
And Wayne enterprises is about to
fall into the hands of John Daggett.

750
01:00:12,693 --> 01:00:14,120
The weapons

751
01:00:14,232 --> 01:00:16,632
- We can’t let Daggett
get his hands on applied sciences

752
01:00:16,728 --> 01:00:19,784
Applied sciences is shut up tight,
and off the books.

753
01:00:19,878 --> 01:00:22,996
The energy project is a different story.

754
01:00:23,093 --> 01:00:24,898
Miranda Tate...

755
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:27,695
We need to convince the board to get behind her.

756
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:28,850
Let’s show her the reactor

757
01:00:28,955 --> 01:00:32,570
We’re meeting her there in 35 minutes.
You better get dressed.

758
01:00:32,786 --> 01:00:36,032
You brought me out here to show me this, Mr. Fox?

759
01:00:36,330 --> 01:00:38,996
Bear with me, miss Tate.

760
01:00:42,632 --> 01:00:46,541
Keep your hands and feet inside the car at all times.

761
01:00:51,739 --> 01:00:54,058
This is it, isn't it?

762
01:00:54,153 --> 01:00:56,176
The reactor is beneath the river

763
01:00:56,303 --> 01:01:00,831
So that it could be instantly flooded
in an event of a security breach.

764
01:01:00,973 --> 01:01:04,902
Is Bruce Wayne really that paranoid?

765
01:01:04,997 --> 01:01:07,641
I’m gonna plead the fifth on that one.

766
01:01:14,021 --> 01:01:17,124
I thought you might like to see
what your investment built.

767
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:21,561
No fossil fuels.
Free, clean energy for an entire city.

768
01:01:21,673 --> 01:01:25,071
Three years ago a Russian scientist

769
01:01:25,072 --> 01:01:27,961
published a paper on weaponized fusion reactions.

770
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:33,282
One week later your reactor started
developing problems...

771
01:01:33,453 --> 01:01:35,820
I think this machine works.

772
01:01:35,954 --> 01:01:42,773
Miranda, if it were operational,
the danger to Gotham would be too great.

773
01:01:42,866 --> 01:01:46,149
Would it make you feel better to
know that the Russian scientist

774
01:01:46,151 --> 01:01:49,017
Died in a plane crash 6 months ago?

775
01:01:49,143 --> 01:01:52,800
Someone else will work out what Dr. Pavel did.

776
01:01:52,912 --> 01:01:55,931
Someone else will figure out how to turn

777
01:01:55,934 --> 01:01:58,951
This power source into a nuclear weapon.

778
01:02:00,254 --> 01:02:06,586
I need you to take control of
Wayne enterprises and this reactor.

779
01:02:06,688 --> 01:02:09,141
- And to do what with it?
- Nothing.

780
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:13,677
- Until we can guarantee its safety.
- And if we can't?

781
01:02:13,795 --> 01:02:15,454
Decommission it, flood it.

782
01:02:15,582 --> 01:02:19,419
Destroy the world’s best chance for
a sustainable future?

783
01:02:19,513 --> 01:02:21,215
If the world’s not ready. Yes.

784
01:02:21,369 --> 01:02:25,697
Bruce, if you want to save the
world you have to start trusting it.

785
01:02:25,844 --> 01:02:26,796
I’m trusting you.

786
01:02:26,798 --> 01:02:29,451
Doesn’t count. You have no choice.

787
01:02:29,595 --> 01:02:32,596
I could’ve flooded this chamber any
time in the last three years.

788
01:02:32,718 --> 01:02:36,936
I’m choosing to trust you, Miranda, please.

789
01:02:44,289 --> 01:02:48,411
Alright ladies and gentlemen,
this meeting will now come to order.

790
01:02:48,512 --> 01:02:51,622
I’d like to point out that we have
a non-Board member here.

791
01:02:51,722 --> 01:02:55,341
I is highly irregular, even if it is his family
name above the door...

792
01:02:55,442 --> 01:02:57,654
Bruce Wayne’s family built this company

793
01:02:57,755 --> 01:03:01,864
- And he himself has run it...
- Into the ground, sir!

794
01:03:01,966 --> 01:03:03,071
Does anybody disagrees?

795
01:03:03,173 --> 01:03:04,480
Check the value of your shares this morning.

796
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:09,769
Gambling on crazy futures didn’t
just lose Mr. Wayne his seat,

797
01:03:09,771 --> 01:03:14,133
It’s lost us all a lot of money.
He needs to leave.

798
01:03:14,234 --> 01:03:17,352
I’m afraid he has a point, Mr. Wayne.

799
01:03:24,796 --> 01:03:26,505
Let’s get down to business.

800
01:03:28,213 --> 01:03:29,922
Wayne, how’s it feel to be one of the people?!

801
01:03:30,023 --> 01:03:31,836
Mr. Wayne, they're towing your car..

802
01:03:31,937 --> 01:03:33,949
I didn't know that you're off the board.

803
01:03:36,286 --> 01:03:37,883
Looks like you need a lift.

804
01:03:38,005 --> 01:03:40,673
Mr. Wayne, will you get a ride?

805
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:44,610
How the hell did Miranda Tate get
the inside track on the Wayne board?!

806
01:03:44,719 --> 01:03:47,177
Was she meeting with Wayne?
Was she sleeping with Wayne?

807
01:03:47,179 --> 01:03:47,926
Not that we know of

808
01:03:48,036 --> 01:03:51,069
Clearly you don’t ’know of’ anything,
do you?! Where’s Bane?!

809
01:03:51,151 --> 01:03:53,507
- We told him it was urgent
- Then where is the masked...

810
01:03:53,589 --> 01:03:57,143
Speak of the devil...
and he shall appear.

811
01:03:57,240 --> 01:04:00,321
What the hell’s going on?

812
01:04:00,568 --> 01:04:03,482
The plan is proceeding as expected.

813
01:04:03,580 --> 01:04:07,640
Really? You see me running Wayne enterprises?!

814
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:11,645
Your stock exchange hit didn’t work, friend.

815
01:04:11,730 --> 01:04:14,370
And now you’ve got my construction crews

816
01:04:14,373 --> 01:04:17,556
Working all hours around the city?

817
01:04:17,668 --> 01:04:23,223
How’s that supposed to help
my company absorb Wayne’s?

818
01:04:25,325 --> 01:04:27,899
- Leave us!
- You stay right there!

819
01:04:27,995 --> 01:04:29,624
I’m in charge!

820
01:04:30,297 --> 01:04:33,705
Do you feel in charge?

821
01:04:37,739 --> 01:04:39,536
I’ve paid you a small fortune

822
01:04:39,704 --> 01:04:42,966
And that gives you power over me?

823
01:04:43,252 --> 01:04:44,705
What is this?

824
01:04:44,831 --> 01:04:50,232
Your money and infrastructure have
been important.

825
01:04:50,331 --> 01:04:51,890
Till now.

826
01:04:51,966 --> 01:04:55,064
- What are you?
- Gotham’s reckoning.

827
01:04:55,175 --> 01:04:58,680
Come to end the borrowed time
you’ve all been living on...

828
01:05:00,122 --> 01:05:03,341
You are pure evil.

829
01:05:03,363 --> 01:05:06,411
- I am necessary evil.
- No!

830
01:05:12,431 --> 01:05:15,008
When you began... why the mask?

831
01:05:15,166 --> 01:05:16,893
To protect the people closest to me.

832
01:05:16,974 --> 01:05:18,850
You’re a loner with no family.

833
01:05:18,962 --> 01:05:20,978
There are always people you care about.

834
01:05:23,021 --> 01:05:25,593
You just don’t realize how
much until they’re gone.

835
01:05:25,674 --> 01:05:28,602
The idea was to be a symbol.

836
01:05:28,697 --> 01:05:34,095
Batman could be anybody, that was the point.

837
01:05:34,285 --> 01:05:37,518
- It was damn good to see him back.
- Not everybody agrees.

838
01:05:37,628 --> 01:05:39,327
They’ll figure it out in the end.

839
01:05:39,343 --> 01:05:42,112
Got anything on Bane’s whereabouts?

840
01:05:42,556 --> 01:05:45,854
Yeah, I’ve got 500 pages
of tunnel records and a flashlight.

841
01:05:45,948 --> 01:05:47,684
I could use some help.

842
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:51,012
You know what? Drop me in old town...

843
01:05:55,482 --> 01:05:58,355
- I don't think so!
- That is not how it works.

844
01:05:58,436 --> 01:06:00,516
He’s not a mark.

845
01:06:00,628 --> 01:06:03,382
And he doesn’t have a cent to his name, anyway.

846
01:06:04,032 --> 01:06:08,191
Yeah, it’s not much.
But it’s more that you’ve got right now.

847
01:06:08,346 --> 01:06:11,177
Actually, they’re letting me keep the house.

848
01:06:11,286 --> 01:06:13,978
The rich don’t even go broke same
as the rest of us, huh?

849
01:06:14,087 --> 01:06:18,223
My powerful friend hopes to change
your mind about leaving.

850
01:06:18,317 --> 01:06:20,797
- And how would he do that?
- By giving you what you want.

851
01:06:20,941 --> 01:06:24,027
- It doesn’t exist.
- He says it does.

852
01:06:24,186 --> 01:06:26,898
- He wants to meet. Tonight.
- Why?

853
01:06:27,044 --> 01:06:31,088
He needs to find Bane.
He says you’d know how.

854
01:06:33,852 --> 01:06:38,148
- Tell him I’ll think about it.
- Okay. I like your place.

855
01:06:39,657 --> 01:06:41,737
Mr. Wayne?

856
01:06:43,307 --> 01:06:46,216
I’m sorry they took all your money.

857
01:06:46,624 --> 01:06:48,775
No, you’re not.

858
01:06:49,191 --> 01:06:51,622
- Can we help you, officer?
- Yeah.

859
01:06:51,734 --> 01:06:54,565
John Daggett’s body was just found
in a dumpster an hour ago.

860
01:06:54,566 --> 01:06:57,049
I thought you
might like to know.

861
01:06:57,180 --> 01:06:58,208
Why?

862
01:06:58,218 --> 01:07:00,047
Well, name is all over the permits...

863
01:07:00,048 --> 01:07:01,712
...I just pulled to map the
tunnels under Gotham.

864
01:07:01,841 --> 01:07:05,914
That's MTA maintenance, sewer
construction and others things...

865
01:07:06,032 --> 01:07:08,268
Where did you get to
with the tunnel searches?

866
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:12,606
Remind me to tell the detail
to keep hotheads out.

867
01:07:12,682 --> 01:07:14,643
We’ve had teams down there,
but it’s a huge network.

868
01:07:14,743 --> 01:07:16,322
Well, Get more men.

869
01:07:16,402 --> 01:07:18,369
Work a grid.
I want him found.

870
01:07:18,462 --> 01:07:20,832
Yeah... The masked man.
We’re on it.

871
01:07:20,926 --> 01:07:23,765
Lose the uniform
You’re working for me now.

872
01:07:23,893 --> 01:07:26,317
We could use some
hotter heads around here.

873
01:07:26,475 --> 01:07:28,194
Sir, Daggett's just could be a coincidence

874
01:07:28,305 --> 01:07:30,081
You’re a detective now, son.

875
01:07:30,238 --> 01:07:34,068
You’re not allowed to
believe in coincidence anymore.

876
01:07:45,296 --> 01:07:48,449
- Nobody’s answering.
- No.

877
01:07:48,548 --> 01:07:52,795
- I’m on my own now.
- Do you have keys?

878
01:07:53,660 --> 01:07:55,277
Never needed them.

879
01:08:01,613 --> 01:08:03,890
Hope you don’t like me for my money.

880
01:08:03,931 --> 01:08:06,249
Suffering builds character.

881
01:08:12,785 --> 01:08:15,990
I'll take care of
your parents' legacy, Bruce.

882
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:19,613
Who's this?

883
01:08:26,551 --> 01:08:28,453
Where's Alfred?

884
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:31,672
He left.

885
01:08:32,986 --> 01:08:34,898
Taking everything.

886
01:08:58,931 --> 01:09:03,957
- What's that?
- I think my power's been shut off.

887
01:09:09,087 --> 01:09:11,195
You're good at that.

888
01:09:11,499 --> 01:09:14,314
When I was a child we had almost nothing.

889
01:09:14,416 --> 01:09:20,251
But on the nights when we had a fire,
we felt very rich indeed.

890
01:09:21,263 --> 01:09:24,689
I assumed your family was wealthy.

891
01:09:25,092 --> 01:09:29,213
Not always.
Not when I was young.

892
01:09:29,814 --> 01:09:34,527
- An old mistake.
- I've made a few myself

893
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:38,250
More than a few.

894
01:09:39,859 --> 01:09:43,478
We could leave. Tonight.

895
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:48,310
Take my plane.
Go anywhere we wanted.

896
01:09:49,527 --> 01:09:53,844
Someday perhaps. Not tonight.

897
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:24,411
Don't be shy.

898
01:10:26,228 --> 01:10:28,642
Wayne says you can
get me the 'Clean Slate'.

899
01:10:28,844 --> 01:10:31,961
- That depends
- On what?

900
01:10:32,063 --> 01:10:33,667
On what you want it for.

901
01:10:33,769 --> 01:10:36,883
I acquired it to keep it
out of the wrong hands

902
01:10:36,983 --> 01:10:39,496
Still don't trust me, huh?

903
01:10:39,698 --> 01:10:44,644
- How can we change that?
- Start by taking me to Bane

904
01:10:47,602 --> 01:10:49,394
You asked.

905
01:10:51,281 --> 01:10:53,765
From here, Bane's men patrol the
tunnels...

906
01:10:53,767 --> 01:10:56,072
...and they are not your
average brawlers.

907
01:10:56,718 --> 01:10:58,367
Neither am I.

908
01:11:05,998 --> 01:11:07,049
- He's behind you.
- Who?

909
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:08,623
Me.

910
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:14,992
Where do you think you're...?

911
01:11:27,857 --> 01:11:29,632
Just a little further.

912
01:11:37,161 --> 01:11:39,929
I had to find a way
to stop them trying to kill me.

913
01:11:40,038 --> 01:11:42,752
You made a serious mistake.

914
01:11:42,848 --> 01:11:45,988
Not as serious as yours...

915
01:11:46,066 --> 01:11:48,232
...I fear.

916
01:11:51,202 --> 01:11:56,331
- Bane.
- Let's not stand on ceremony here...

917
01:11:57,034 --> 01:12:00,033
...Mr. Wayne.

918
01:12:10,813 --> 01:12:12,723
Peace has cost you strength.

919
01:12:12,823 --> 01:12:15,314
Victory has defeated you.

920
01:13:17,259 --> 01:13:20,034
Theatricality and deception...

921
01:13:20,145 --> 01:13:22,889
...powerful agents to the uninitiated.

922
01:13:22,983 --> 01:13:26,654
But we are initiated, aren't we, Bruce?

923
01:13:26,745 --> 01:13:29,430
Members of the League of Shadows.

924
01:13:31,607 --> 01:13:34,023
And you betrayed us.

925
01:13:35,011 --> 01:13:40,789
Us? You were excommunicated.
From a gang of psychopaths.

926
01:13:44,541 --> 01:13:47,865
I am the League of Shadows...

927
01:13:47,962 --> 01:13:51,926
...and I'm here to fulfill
Ra's Al Ghul's destiny.

928
01:14:04,901 --> 01:14:09,150
You fight like a younger man.
With nothing held back.

929
01:14:09,499 --> 01:14:13,598
It's admirable. But mistaken.

930
01:14:17,207 --> 01:14:20,862
Ah, You think darkness is your ally.

931
01:14:20,957 --> 01:14:26,810
But you merely adopted the dark.
I was born in it.

932
01:14:26,938 --> 01:14:30,158
Molded by it.

933
01:14:30,344 --> 01:14:33,750
I didn't see the light
until I was already a man.

934
01:14:33,876 --> 01:14:36,923
And by then it was
nothing to me but blinding.

935
01:14:39,499 --> 01:14:44,024
The shadows betray you,
because they belong to me.

936
01:14:48,842 --> 01:14:52,467
I will show you where
I've made my home...

937
01:14:52,568 --> 01:14:56,181
...while preparing to bring justice.

938
01:14:58,136 --> 01:15:00,853
Then, I will break you.

939
01:15:09,151 --> 01:15:13,394
Your precious armory.
Gratefully accepted.

940
01:15:13,493 --> 01:15:15,809
We will need it.

941
01:15:24,117 --> 01:15:28,139
Ah, yes! I was wondering
what would break first...

942
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:34,458
...your spirit...

943
01:15:38,556 --> 01:15:40,669
...or your body.

944
01:16:24,628 --> 01:16:25,835
Get me Commissioner Gordon.

945
01:16:25,936 --> 01:16:27,948
I got a line on the
Congressman's kidnapping.

946
01:16:32,306 --> 01:16:39,372
subtitle by:
A m i r & H o s s e i n

947
01:16:40,717 --> 01:16:42,125
- Excuse me, Miss.
- Yes?

948
01:16:42,227 --> 01:16:45,446
I'm going to need to see your
ticket and identification, please.

949
01:16:45,748 --> 01:16:48,264
Do you mind?

950
01:17:00,432 --> 01:17:03,346
I showed your picture
to Congressman. Guess what?

951
01:17:03,750 --> 01:17:07,772
- Don't tell me, still in love?
- Oh, Head over heels.

952
01:17:07,974 --> 01:17:09,683
Pressing charges, though.

953
01:17:09,885 --> 01:17:13,546
You've made some mistakes, Ms. Kyle.

954
01:17:13,745 --> 01:17:17,502
- Girl's got to eat.
- And you have an appetite.

955
01:17:17,602 --> 01:17:19,882
Why would you run? You can't hide
from us with a record like this.

956
01:17:19,981 --> 01:17:24,153
- Maybe it's not you I'm running from.
- Who then? Bane?

957
01:17:24,253 --> 01:17:25,828
What do you know about him?

958
01:17:25,928 --> 01:17:29,785
That you should be
as afraid of him as I am.

959
01:17:29,885 --> 01:17:31,963
We can offer you protection.

960
01:17:34,837 --> 01:17:36,519
Okay.

961
01:17:40,577 --> 01:17:44,935
When I spotted you, I was looking
for a friend of mine, Bruce Wayne.

962
01:17:47,249 --> 01:17:49,033
Did they kill him?

963
01:17:50,518 --> 01:17:52,695
I'm not sure.

964
01:18:11,897 --> 01:18:16,673
Why didn't you just kill me?

965
01:18:16,709 --> 01:18:20,706
You don't fear death.
You welcome it.

966
01:18:20,708 --> 01:18:23,878
Your punishment must be more severe.

967
01:18:23,881 --> 01:18:27,360
- You're a torturer...
- Yes.

968
01:18:27,909 --> 01:18:31,198
But not of your body.

969
01:18:33,765 --> 01:18:35,931
Of your soul.

970
01:18:35,933 --> 01:18:40,078
- Where am I?
- Home.

971
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:45,910
Where I learned the truth
about despair. As will you.

972
01:18:45,947 --> 01:18:50,302
There is a reason that this prison
is the worst hell on earth...

973
01:18:50,304 --> 01:18:52,061
Hope.

974
01:18:52,062 --> 01:18:55,797
Every man who has rotted here over
the centuries has looked up to the light...

975
01:18:55,799 --> 01:18:59,534
...and imagined climbing to freedom.

976
01:18:59,537 --> 01:19:04,236
So easy. So simple.

977
01:19:04,238 --> 01:19:10,527
And, like shipwrecked men turning to
sea water from uncontrollable thirst...

978
01:19:11,884 --> 01:19:14,695
...many have died trying.

979
01:19:14,698 --> 01:19:19,860
I learned here that there can be
no true despair without hope.

980
01:19:19,861 --> 01:19:22,094
So as I terrorize Gotham...

981
01:19:22,097 --> 01:19:26,921
I will feed its people hope
to poison their souls.

982
01:19:27,627 --> 01:19:30,449
I will let them believe they can survive...

983
01:19:30,451 --> 01:19:33,732
...so that you can watch
them clamber over each other...

984
01:19:33,733 --> 01:19:37,045
...to stay in the sun.

985
01:19:39,217 --> 01:19:42,951
You could watch me torture entire city...

986
01:19:42,954 --> 01:19:47,233
...and then, when you have truly
understood the depths of your failure...

987
01:19:47,236 --> 01:19:49,995
...we will fulfill Ra's al Ghul's destiny.

988
01:19:53,667 --> 01:19:56,786
We will destroy Gotham.

989
01:19:57,504 --> 01:20:04,991
And then when it is done
and Gotham is ashes...

990
01:20:10,267 --> 01:20:13,897
...then you have my permission to die.

991
01:20:27,223 --> 01:20:28,944
We're locking her up in here?

992
01:20:28,980 --> 01:20:32,856
The Dent Act allows non-segregation
based on extraordinary need.

993
01:20:32,857 --> 01:20:35,900
First time she broke out of
women's correctional she was 16.

994
01:20:36,001 --> 01:20:40,285
- Little closer, baby...
- Why, honey, you wanna hold my hand?

995
01:20:40,670 --> 01:20:42,506
She's gonna be fine.

996
01:20:43,207 --> 01:20:46,807
Still don't see the need of
a board meeting for the energy project.

997
01:20:46,808 --> 01:20:48,376
Bruce got a lot of things right.

998
01:20:48,378 --> 01:20:50,976
Keeping the board in the dark
wasn't one of them.

999
01:20:53,771 --> 01:20:58,619
Oh, good of you to join us,
Chair, President.

1000
01:20:58,621 --> 01:21:02,269
All I need now is one more
Ordinary Board member.

1001
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:09,302
- Mr. Fox, would you like to nominate?
- No. I will volunteer.

1002
01:21:09,337 --> 01:21:11,597
Where are you taking us?

1003
01:21:21,606 --> 01:21:22,946
You were right, Commissioner!

1004
01:21:23,147 --> 01:21:24,727
Would you excuses us, please?

1005
01:21:24,730 --> 01:21:25,765
What's happened?

1006
01:21:25,899 --> 01:21:28,242
Your masked man kidnapped
the Wayne Enterprises board.

1007
01:21:28,244 --> 01:21:31,415
He let most of them go,
but took three down into the sewers.

1008
01:21:31,417 --> 01:21:33,614
No more patrols,
no more hide and seek.

1009
01:21:33,617 --> 01:21:36,637
Get every available cop
down there and smoke him out!

1010
01:21:36,638 --> 01:21:40,900
- The Mayor won't want panic.
- So it's a training exercise.

1011
01:21:43,322 --> 01:21:46,138
I'm sorry I didn't take you seriously.

1012
01:21:46,141 --> 01:21:50,131
Not you.
You're telling me the Batman have gone.

1013
01:21:50,133 --> 01:21:55,250
So you chase up the Daggett leads,
any way you can.

1014
01:21:55,252 --> 01:21:56,697
Yes, sir.

1015
01:22:06,253 --> 01:22:11,896
He asks how much you would
pay us to let you die?

1016
01:22:11,899 --> 01:22:14,756
I told him... I told him
you have nothing.

1017
01:22:14,757 --> 01:22:16,391
Do it for the pleasure.

1018
01:22:16,393 --> 01:22:20,682
They pay me more than dead
to keep you alive.

1019
01:22:27,342 --> 01:22:29,767
He will try the climb.

1020
01:22:43,622 --> 01:22:46,754
Has anyone made it?

1021
01:22:46,755 --> 01:22:49,605
Of course not.

1022
01:22:59,058 --> 01:23:02,270
He says there is one who did.

1023
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:04,119
A child.

1024
01:23:05,421 --> 01:23:08,307
A child born in this hell.

1025
01:23:08,508 --> 01:23:13,227
- Bane.
- An old legend. Nothing more.

1026
01:23:18,173 --> 01:23:23,374
- Don't.
- Whatever it is they want you to see, it's happening soon.

1027
01:23:48,729 --> 01:23:51,011
Fire in the hole!

1028
01:24:18,757 --> 01:24:20,793
Turn it on.

1029
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:29,451
I only need one other board member.
There are eight others waiting.

1030
01:24:29,454 --> 01:24:31,061
I won't do it.

1031
01:24:31,540 --> 01:24:33,551
Alright, stop.

1032
01:24:33,552 --> 01:24:36,933
Lucius, you'll kill this man and yourself...

1033
01:24:36,935 --> 01:24:39,489
...and you'll barely slow them down.

1034
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:08,809
Go on then, do your work.

1035
01:25:11,026 --> 01:25:13,154
Take them up to the surface.

1036
01:25:13,156 --> 01:25:17,347
People of their status
deserve to experience...

1037
01:25:17,349 --> 01:25:20,981
...the next era of western civilization.

1038
01:25:24,618 --> 01:25:26,757
I've been to half of Daggett's
cement plants, some odd locations...

1039
01:25:26,759 --> 01:25:28,986
...they've poured
for underground construction.

1040
01:25:28,988 --> 01:25:30,959
Anything strange about the pourings?

1041
01:25:30,961 --> 01:25:35,482
Honestly, Commissioner, I don't know
anything about civil engineering.

1042
01:25:35,484 --> 01:25:38,960
But you know about patterns.
Keep looking

1043
01:25:43,659 --> 01:25:48,860
It's done. This is now a
4- megaton nuclear bomb.

1044
01:25:50,394 --> 01:25:54,294
Pull the core out of the reactor.

1045
01:25:54,297 --> 01:25:56,878
No! You cannot.

1046
01:25:56,879 --> 01:26:01,029
This is the only power source
capable of sustaining it.

1047
01:26:01,031 --> 01:26:05,337
If you move it, the core will decay
in a matter of months.

1048
01:26:05,339 --> 01:26:09,551
- Five, by my calculations.
- And then it will go off.

1049
01:26:11,054 --> 01:26:17,466
For the sake of your children, Dr. Pavel,
indeed, I hope it does.

1050
01:26:17,493 --> 01:26:20,563
Hey! Hey!

1051
01:26:22,690 --> 01:26:25,588
That was you in front of
the stock exchange, wasn't it?

1052
01:26:26,487 --> 01:26:27,881
- When?
- When?

1053
01:26:27,944 --> 01:26:30,774
When half the city's cops
were trying to pull onto Castle Street...

1054
01:26:30,776 --> 01:26:32,482
...and your truck was shutting them out.

1055
01:26:32,483 --> 01:26:36,198
- Oh, yeah. You're the cop
- Detective, now.

1056
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:40,510
And as a detective, I'm not
allowed to believe in coincidence.

1057
01:26:50,438 --> 01:26:53,213
What were you doing here?
What are you working on?

1058
01:27:01,024 --> 01:27:05,619
Commissioner, it's Blake. I got two dead
witnesses and a lot of questions.

1059
01:27:05,620 --> 01:27:06,767
Call me when...

1060
01:27:07,343 --> 01:27:11,361
Wait a minute.
They've four barrels of Polyisobutylene.

1061
01:27:12,852 --> 01:27:15,740
That looks like motor oil
right next to it. Jesus!

1062
01:27:15,743 --> 01:27:19,796
They're not making cement,
they're making explosives.

1063
01:27:26,327 --> 01:27:29,282
- Patch me into Foley!
- Foley's overseeing the operation.

1064
01:27:29,285 --> 01:27:31,886
They're heading into a trap!

1065
01:27:31,887 --> 01:27:34,147
We're seeing literally thousands of
police heading into the sewers.

1066
01:27:34,150 --> 01:27:36,410
Mr. Mayor, would literally
thousands of police...

1067
01:27:36,411 --> 01:27:38,435
It's a training exercise, that's all.

1068
01:27:38,572 --> 01:27:39,718
Now, if you'll excuse me...

1069
01:27:39,719 --> 01:27:42,101
I've got tickets to watch
our boys thrash Rapid City.

1070
01:27:44,343 --> 01:27:45,190
Foley.

1071
01:27:45,288 --> 01:27:46,897
It's a trap!
Pull everyone out!

1072
01:27:46,899 --> 01:27:49,134
Bane's been pouring concrete
laced with explosives

1073
01:27:49,137 --> 01:27:50,664
Where?

1074
01:28:05,997 --> 01:28:07,684
There's a ring around the tunnels.

1075
01:28:07,687 --> 01:28:10,090
They're gonna blow it
and trap the cops underground!

1076
01:28:10,924 --> 01:28:14,237
Pull 'em out! Pull 'em out, now!

1077
01:28:38,190 --> 01:28:40,777
That's a lovely lovely  voice.

1078
01:29:21,567 --> 01:29:24,098
Let the games begin.

1079
01:30:58,346 --> 01:31:04,109
Gotham, take control...

1080
01:31:04,412 --> 01:31:08,826
...take control of your city.

1081
01:31:13,542 --> 01:31:15,574
- Foley!
- Jesus, Blake!

1082
01:31:15,575 --> 01:31:19,112
Every cop in the city's
down in those tunnels!

1083
01:31:19,115 --> 01:31:20,219
Not every cop.

1084
01:31:34,388 --> 01:31:37,751
Sir, you're okay? I'm a police officer,
I need your car, right now.

1085
01:32:28,397 --> 01:32:30,658
Clear the corners, rookie.

1086
01:32:31,465 --> 01:32:33,459
Get my coat, son.

1087
01:32:33,462 --> 01:32:40,009
This... This is
the instrument of your liberation.

1088
01:32:42,068 --> 01:32:45,228
Satellite shows a radiation spike.

1089
01:32:45,231 --> 01:32:48,429
Whatever it is... it's nuclear.

1090
01:32:52,291 --> 01:32:55,898
Identify yourself to the world.

1091
01:32:56,826 --> 01:33:01,386
Dr. Leonid Pavel,
nuclear physicist.

1092
01:33:01,828 --> 01:33:05,476
Pavel was confirmed dead.

1093
01:33:05,478 --> 01:33:09,954
Plane crash on an Agency pull-out of
Uzbekistan. But... it looks like it's him.

1094
01:33:09,957 --> 01:33:13,837
And what... What is this?

1095
01:33:13,839 --> 01:33:20,700
It's a fully primed neutron bomb.
With a blast radius of six miles.

1096
01:33:20,702 --> 01:33:25,163
And who is capable of
disarming such a device?

1097
01:33:26,382 --> 01:33:28,151
Only me.

1098
01:33:28,154 --> 01:33:33,132
Only you...
Thank you, good doctor!

1099
01:33:36,205 --> 01:33:39,547
Now, the bomb is armed...

1100
01:33:39,548 --> 01:33:46,591
...This bomb is mobile and the identity
of the triggerman is a mystery.

1101
01:33:47,396 --> 01:33:52,359
For one of you holds the detonator.

1102
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:56,958
Now, we come here
not as conquerors, but as liberators...

1103
01:33:56,960 --> 01:34:01,558
...to return control of
this city to the people.

1104
01:34:02,919 --> 01:34:08,235
And at the first sign of interference
from the outside world...

1105
01:34:08,237 --> 01:34:12,817
...or to those people attempting to flee...

1106
01:34:14,061 --> 01:34:17,398
...this anonymous Gothamite...

1107
01:34:17,399 --> 01:34:22,285
...this unsung hero
will trigger the bomb.

1108
01:34:23,660 --> 01:34:27,175
For now, martial law is in effect.

1109
01:34:27,177 --> 01:34:30,400
Return to your homes...

1110
01:34:30,401 --> 01:34:35,925
...hold your families close... and wait.

1111
01:34:35,928 --> 01:34:41,081
Tomorrow you claim what is rightfully yours.

1112
01:34:45,485 --> 01:34:50,719
Pull back the fighters,
start high-level reconnaissance flights.

1113
01:34:51,023 --> 01:34:53,673
Get the President on the line.

1114
01:35:13,916 --> 01:35:18,363
Tanks and planes cannot
stop us detonating our device.

1115
01:35:18,365 --> 01:35:20,795
Send an emissary to discuss terms of...

1116
01:35:20,797 --> 01:35:23,781
...access for supplies and communication.

1117
01:35:29,368 --> 01:35:31,772
How many of you are there, son?

1118
01:35:33,124 --> 01:35:34,890
You don't have enough men to stop...

1119
01:35:34,891 --> 01:35:37,228
...12 million people leaving that island.

1120
01:35:38,135 --> 01:35:41,714
No, no, we don't. But you do.

1121
01:35:42,918 --> 01:35:46,453
Why the hell would I try to help you
keep your hostages?

1122
01:35:46,455 --> 01:35:51,950
If one person crosses this bridge
Gotham gets blown to hell.

1123
01:35:57,265 --> 01:36:00,074
The people of
our greatest city are resilient.

1124
01:36:01,084 --> 01:36:05,927
They have proven this before,
and they will prove this again.

1125
01:36:05,929 --> 01:36:10,376
We do not negotiate with terrorists...

1126
01:36:10,378 --> 01:36:13,337
...but we do recognize realities.

1127
01:36:13,338 --> 01:36:20,462
As the situation develops, one thing
must be understood above all others...

1128
01:36:20,968 --> 01:36:24,501
People of Gotham,
we have not abandoned you.

1129
01:36:24,503 --> 01:36:26,444
What does that mean?

1130
01:36:26,447 --> 01:36:29,331
It means we're on our own.

1131
01:36:29,332 --> 01:36:31,465
I have to get in front of a camera.

1132
01:36:31,467 --> 01:36:34,517
Oh, sir, they'll kill you the second
you show your face.

1133
01:36:34,519 --> 01:36:37,442
Bane says he's
giving Gotham back to the people.

1134
01:36:37,544 --> 01:36:38,876
They need to know that I could lead.

1135
01:36:38,878 --> 01:36:40,552
Bane's not gonna let that happen.

1136
01:36:40,555 --> 01:36:43,957
- Then he'll show his true colors.
- And you'll be dead.

1137
01:37:02,448 --> 01:37:07,184
Behind you stands a symbol of oppression.

1138
01:37:08,313 --> 01:37:12,989
Blackgate Prison.
Where a thousand men...

1139
01:37:12,991 --> 01:37:17,230
...have languished for years,
Under the name of this man...

1140
01:37:17,389 --> 01:37:20,581
Harvey Dent.

1141
01:37:20,616 --> 01:37:27,651
Who has been held up to you
as the shining example of justice.

1142
01:37:27,653 --> 01:37:30,342
We're gonna keep moving you,
till we can get you in front of a camera.

1143
01:37:30,344 --> 01:37:34,273
You've been supplied with a false idol...

1144
01:37:34,275 --> 01:37:38,595
...to stop you tearing down
this corrupt city.

1145
01:37:38,597 --> 01:37:43,068
Let me tell you the truth
about Harvey Dent.

1146
01:37:43,070 --> 01:37:47,846
From the words of
Gotham's Police Commissioner...

1147
01:37:47,882 --> 01:37:50,817
...James Gordon.

1148
01:37:50,819 --> 01:37:56,808
"The Batman didn't murder Harvey Dent,
he saved my boy.

1149
01:37:56,809 --> 01:38:00,835
"Then took the blame for
Harvey's appalling crimes...

1150
01:38:00,838 --> 01:38:04,036
"... so that I could, to my shame...

1151
01:38:04,038 --> 01:38:11,077
"... build a lie around this fallen idol.

1152
01:38:12,524 --> 01:38:18,229
"I praised the madman who
tried to murder my own child.

1153
01:38:18,231 --> 01:38:22,221
"But I can no longer live with my lie.

1154
01:38:22,224 --> 01:38:26,414
"It is time to trust
the people of Gotham with the truth...

1155
01:38:26,415 --> 01:38:30,895
"... and it is time for me to resign. "

1156
01:38:30,898 --> 01:38:35,047
And do you accept this man's resignation?

1157
01:38:36,535 --> 01:38:41,292
And do you accept
the resignation of all of this liars?

1158
01:38:41,295 --> 01:38:43,111
of all the corrupt?

1159
01:38:46,449 --> 01:38:50,064
These men, locked up
in Blackgate for eight years...

1160
01:38:50,066 --> 01:38:53,534
...denied parole under the Dent Act.
Based on a lie.

1161
01:38:53,538 --> 01:38:56,169
Gotham needed a hero.

1162
01:38:56,171 --> 01:39:00,460
And needs it now more than ever.
You betrayed everything you stood for.

1163
01:39:02,169 --> 01:39:04,192
There's a point.

1164
01:39:06,138 --> 01:39:09,271
Far out there.
When the structures fail you.

1165
01:39:09,274 --> 01:39:12,843
When the rules aren't weapons
anymore, they're shackles...

1166
01:39:12,879 --> 01:39:15,785
...letting the bad guy getting ahead.

1167
01:39:17,054 --> 01:39:22,139
One day you may
face such a moment of crisis.

1168
01:39:22,141 --> 01:39:26,695
And in that moment,
I hope you have a friend like I did.

1169
01:39:26,697 --> 01:39:33,061
To plunge their hands into the filth,
so that you can keep yours clean.

1170
01:39:33,062 --> 01:39:37,548
Your hands look pretty filthy
to me, Commissioner.

1171
01:39:37,549 --> 01:39:42,562
We take Gotham from the corrupt.

1172
01:39:44,155 --> 01:39:45,775
The rich.

1173
01:39:45,778 --> 01:39:52,603
The oppressors of generations who've
kept you down with the myth of opportunity.

1174
01:39:52,604 --> 01:39:58,657
And we give it to you, the people.

1175
01:39:59,883 --> 01:40:04,033
Gotham is yours.
None shall interfere.

1176
01:40:04,037 --> 01:40:06,559
Do as you please.

1177
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:12,881
But start by storming Blackgate
and freeing the oppressed.

1178
01:40:21,284 --> 01:40:24,462
Step forward, those who would serve.

1179
01:40:26,056 --> 01:40:29,597
For an army will be raised.

1180
01:40:31,955 --> 01:40:36,787
The powerful will be ripped
from their decadent nests...

1181
01:40:40,808 --> 01:40:46,966
...and cast into the cold world
that we know and endure.

1182
01:40:51,354 --> 01:40:55,418
Courts will be convened.

1183
01:41:01,093 --> 01:41:05,080
Spoils will be enjoyed.

1184
01:41:08,422 --> 01:41:11,605
Blood will be shed.

1185
01:41:13,478 --> 01:41:16,551
The Police will survive...

1186
01:41:16,652 --> 01:41:21,270
...as they learn to serve true justice.

1187
01:41:21,271 --> 01:41:25,181
This great city...

1188
01:41:26,439 --> 01:41:29,792
...it will endure.

1189
01:41:30,801 --> 01:41:34,887
Gotham will survive.

1190
01:41:56,022 --> 01:41:59,257
He says you must first fix your back.

1191
01:41:59,259 --> 01:42:00,573
How does he know?

1192
01:42:00,575 --> 01:42:03,992
He was the prison doctor.
A morphine addict...

1193
01:42:03,995 --> 01:42:08,069
...who incurred
displeasure of powerful people.

1194
01:42:08,071 --> 01:42:11,086
Including your masked friend.

1195
01:42:11,088 --> 01:42:12,534
How?

1196
01:42:13,690 --> 01:42:19,145
Many years ago, it was a time of plague.

1197
01:42:19,181 --> 01:42:23,851
Some of the other prisoners attacked Bane.

1198
01:42:24,654 --> 01:42:27,866
The doctor's fumbling
attempts to repair the damage...

1199
01:42:27,869 --> 01:42:31,080
...left him in perpetual agony.

1200
01:42:31,081 --> 01:42:34,492
The mask holds the pain at bay.

1201
01:42:34,495 --> 01:42:40,129
Bane was child you spoke of?
Was he born here?

1202
01:42:40,132 --> 01:42:44,971
The legend is that there was a mercenary
who worked for the local warlord.

1203
01:42:44,972 --> 01:42:48,356
He fell in love with warlord's daughter.

1204
01:42:48,359 --> 01:42:52,447
They were married in secret.
When the warlord found out...

1205
01:42:52,448 --> 01:42:57,092
...the mercenary was condemned to this pit.

1206
01:42:57,093 --> 01:42:59,025
But then he exiled him instead.

1207
01:42:59,028 --> 01:43:03,516
The mercenary understood that was
the daughter who had secured his release...

1208
01:43:03,519 --> 01:43:09,465
But what he could not know was
the true price of his freedom.

1209
01:43:09,466 --> 01:43:13,242
She took his place in the pit.

1210
01:43:14,489 --> 01:43:19,199
And she was with a child.
The mercenary's child.

1211
01:43:20,502 --> 01:43:25,044
Innocence cannot flower underground.
It was to be stamped out.

1212
01:43:26,596 --> 01:43:32,871
One day,
the doctor forgot the lock the cell.

1213
01:43:39,268 --> 01:43:43,477
But the child had a friend.
A protector...

1214
01:43:43,480 --> 01:43:48,118
...who showed the other that this innocence
was their redemption...

1215
01:43:48,119 --> 01:43:49,737
...it was to be priced.

1216
01:43:49,739 --> 01:43:51,976
The mother was not so lucky.

1217
01:43:54,477 --> 01:43:59,290
This is Bane's prison now.
He wouldn't want the story told.

1218
01:43:59,291 --> 01:44:00,291
Oh, God!

1219
01:44:02,291 --> 01:44:10,291
There's a vertebra
protruding from your back.

1220
01:44:13,896 --> 01:44:16,484
- It has to be put back.
- How...?

1221
01:44:21,229 --> 01:44:24,895
Stay like this. Until you stand.

1222
01:44:33,181 --> 01:44:36,503
Did you not think I'd return, Bruce?

1223
01:44:42,556 --> 01:44:45,318
I told you I was immortal.

1224
01:44:46,826 --> 01:44:48,795
I watched... I watched you die.

1225
01:44:48,798 --> 01:44:53,066
Oh. There are many forms of
immortality.

1226
01:44:54,053 --> 01:44:58,308
Once I had a wife. My great love.

1227
01:45:00,035 --> 01:45:02,566
She was taken from me.

1228
01:45:02,567 --> 01:45:05,472
You were the mercenary.

1229
01:45:07,446 --> 01:45:12,336
Bane is your child.
Your heir.

1230
01:45:12,372 --> 01:45:15,172
An heir to ensure the League of Shadows...

1231
01:45:15,174 --> 01:45:19,094
...fulfills its duty
to restore balance to civilization.

1232
01:45:19,130 --> 01:45:22,945
You yourself fought
the decadence of Gotham for years.

1233
01:45:22,947 --> 01:45:27,309
With all your strength,
all your resources...

1234
01:45:27,311 --> 01:45:29,986
...all your moral authority.

1235
01:45:30,152 --> 01:45:34,049
And the only victory
you could achieve was a lie.

1236
01:45:34,051 --> 01:45:37,246
Now you understand...
Gotham is beyond saving...

1237
01:45:37,248 --> 01:45:40,199
- No!
- And must be allowed to die.

1238
01:45:57,112 --> 01:45:58,426
No, No!

1239
01:46:33,779 --> 01:46:36,019
- What's that?
- This was someone's home.

1240
01:46:36,020 --> 01:46:39,459
Now it's everyone's home.

1241
01:46:39,462 --> 01:46:43,674
There's a storm coming, remember?
This is what you wanted.

1242
01:47:12,059 --> 01:47:14,925
It's for the bus, in case
there's a chance to evacuate.

1243
01:47:15,328 --> 01:47:18,702
- Any news? Is the Commissioner...?
- The less you know, Father.

1244
01:47:18,738 --> 01:47:20,299
How're the boys doing?

1245
01:47:20,335 --> 01:47:23,711
Well, we've had more power on,
so they got some TV.

1246
01:47:23,713 --> 01:47:27,241
- It's good to see you.
- Blake, you be careful out there.

1247
01:47:27,243 --> 01:47:30,220
They're hunting down cops like dogs.

1248
01:47:35,159 --> 01:47:40,396
- Why build yourself?
- I'm not meant to die in here.

1249
01:47:40,431 --> 01:47:45,236
Here? There?
What's the difference?

1250
01:47:52,490 --> 01:47:55,228
Deshi Deshi Basara Basara!

1251
01:48:45,992 --> 01:48:49,432
I told you it could not be done.

1252
01:48:49,434 --> 01:48:52,300
You told me a child did it.

1253
01:48:52,302 --> 01:48:58,503
But no ordinary child.
A child born in hell.

1254
01:49:02,242 --> 01:49:04,772
Forged from suffering...

1255
01:49:05,761 --> 01:49:09,066
...hardened by pain.

1256
01:49:09,067 --> 01:49:13,316
Not a man from privilege.

1257
01:49:31,136 --> 01:49:33,417
We got Blues in the ground, sir.

1258
01:49:33,720 --> 01:49:36,293
Just waiting on intel.

1259
01:49:41,008 --> 01:49:43,900
- You have ID?
- Of course not.

1260
01:49:43,903 --> 01:49:47,532
- How can we trust you?
- We don't have any choice.

1261
01:49:47,535 --> 01:49:49,861
Commissioner Gordon?
Captain Jones, Special Forces.

1262
01:49:49,862 --> 01:49:52,837
- Captain, glad to have you here.
- It's our job, sir.

1263
01:49:52,839 --> 01:49:54,939
Now, how many of you are there?

1264
01:49:54,941 --> 01:49:57,699
Well, dozens.
I'd rather not say exactly.

1265
01:49:57,700 --> 01:50:01,109
But the men trapped underground
number almost 3000.

1266
01:50:01,112 --> 01:50:03,231
- What kind of condition they're in?
- They've been getting food and water.

1267
01:50:03,233 --> 01:50:05,137
- Could we break them out?
- Yes, sir.

1268
01:50:05,140 --> 01:50:08,391
Take out the mercenaries guarding
the outflow south of Ackerman Park...

1269
01:50:08,393 --> 01:50:11,310
...blow the rubble, you've got
a hole big enough for ten at a time.

1270
01:50:11,312 --> 01:50:13,203
I'm in contact with my partners down there.

1271
01:50:13,205 --> 01:50:14,699
They're waiting for the day.

1272
01:50:14,701 --> 01:50:16,407
Men who haven't seen daylight
for three months?

1273
01:50:16,409 --> 01:50:18,978
Police officers who haven't seen daylight
for three months?

1274
01:50:18,979 --> 01:50:19,878
What about the bomb?

1275
01:50:19,880 --> 01:50:22,310
The satellite can't pick up
any radiation hot spots.

1276
01:50:22,312 --> 01:50:25,851
They keep it on a truck.
It must have a lead-lined roof.

1277
01:50:25,853 --> 01:50:28,826
- They move it constantly.
- Good, so you know the truck?

1278
01:50:28,828 --> 01:50:32,295
Well, it's one of the three.
We've been tracking it.

1279
01:50:32,625 --> 01:50:34,129
Decoy.

1280
01:50:35,149 --> 01:50:37,126
You don't really think
he's coming back, do you?

1281
01:50:37,128 --> 01:50:38,273
Doesn't matter what I think.

1282
01:50:38,275 --> 01:50:42,511
Actually, it does. You should put
your faith in something a little more real.

1283
01:50:42,513 --> 01:50:44,766
The routes don't vary much.

1284
01:50:44,768 --> 01:50:48,214
- What about the triggerman?
- No leads. It's a bluff.

1285
01:50:48,216 --> 01:50:50,787
Bane wouldn't give control of
that bomb to someone else.

1286
01:50:50,789 --> 01:50:52,122
We can't take that chance.

1287
01:50:52,158 --> 01:50:54,731
Until we have the triggerman,
we just track the device.

1288
01:50:54,733 --> 01:50:57,539
And meanwhile,
Gotham lives under a warlord.

1289
01:50:57,541 --> 01:50:58,922
Like some failed state?

1290
01:50:58,924 --> 01:51:01,944
Dial it back, officer.
This situation is unprecedented.

1291
01:51:01,945 --> 01:51:04,009
We can't do anything
to risk millions of lives.

1292
01:51:04,010 --> 01:51:07,401
Aren't you gonna tell him? Aren't you
gonna tell him what's really going on?

1293
01:51:07,403 --> 01:51:10,935
Captain, the situation is
more complicated than you think.

1294
01:51:10,937 --> 01:51:13,023
There's somebody you need to meet.

1295
01:51:13,024 --> 01:51:15,460
I came upstairs looking for a vantage point.

1296
01:51:15,462 --> 01:51:17,862
Found the people who run the
corporation are living up here.

1297
01:51:17,864 --> 01:51:18,607
What corporation?

1298
01:51:18,609 --> 01:51:20,545
Wayne Enterprises.

1299
01:51:30,245 --> 01:51:32,441
Mr. Fox, Would you
like to brief the Captain?

1300
01:51:32,443 --> 01:51:35,244
Miss Tate is fully aware of the situation.

1301
01:51:35,247 --> 01:51:39,797
And as CEO of Wayne Enterprises,
I have to take responsibility for it.

1302
01:51:39,798 --> 01:51:42,028
- Why?
- We built it.

1303
01:51:42,030 --> 01:51:43,545
You built the bomb?

1304
01:51:43,547 --> 01:51:47,932
It was built as a fusion reactor.
The first of its kind.

1305
01:51:47,968 --> 01:51:51,619
Bane turned the core into a bomb,
then removed it from the reactor.

1306
01:51:51,620 --> 01:51:52,838
Now here's the important part.

1307
01:51:52,840 --> 01:51:55,238
As the device's fuel cells deteriorate...

1308
01:51:55,240 --> 01:51:59,038
...it's becoming increasingly unstable,
until the point of detonation.

1309
01:51:59,041 --> 01:52:03,249
- This bomb's a time bomb.
- And it will go off. In 23 days.

1310
01:52:03,251 --> 01:52:05,948
Regardless of the Bane's
revolution or what we...

1311
01:52:05,949 --> 01:52:08,071
...or the outside
world choose to do.

1312
01:52:08,074 --> 01:52:11,036
So, your peace-man plan might not be
as practical as you thought.

1313
01:52:11,039 --> 01:52:12,172
Could you disarm it?

1314
01:52:12,215 --> 01:52:15,438
I could reconnect it to the reactor.
Stabilize it.

1315
01:52:15,441 --> 01:52:17,732
Let's move away from this location,
and call it in.

1316
01:52:17,734 --> 01:52:18,540
Alright, let's go!

1317
01:52:18,542 --> 01:52:22,182
No, Let me take it from here.
You stay and look after these folks.

1318
01:52:29,234 --> 01:52:31,047
Somebody sold us out!

1319
01:52:55,191 --> 01:52:57,773
I'll die before I talk.

1320
01:52:57,774 --> 01:53:01,693
I'm on your schedule, Captain.

1321
01:53:07,035 --> 01:53:12,015
- There were people living upstairs.
- Round them up for judgment.

1322
01:53:15,846 --> 01:53:20,809
And hang them where
the world can see.

1323
01:53:35,579 --> 01:53:40,106
He says the leap to freedom
is not about strength.

1324
01:53:40,108 --> 01:53:44,358
- My body makes the jump.
- Survival is the spirit. The soul.

1325
01:53:49,255 --> 01:53:52,441
My soul's as ready to escape as my body.

1326
01:53:52,443 --> 01:53:55,433
Fear is why you fail

1327
01:53:55,435 --> 01:53:57,967
No, I'm not afraid.

1328
01:53:58,946 --> 01:54:01,131
I'm angry.

1329
01:54:29,375 --> 01:54:30,725
Bruce...

1330
01:54:32,466 --> 01:54:34,773
Why do we fall?

1331
01:54:39,812 --> 01:54:46,852
You do not fear death. You think this
makes you strong. It makes you weak.

1332
01:54:47,814 --> 01:54:49,213
Why?

1333
01:54:49,214 --> 01:54:51,744
How can you move faster than possible?

1334
01:54:51,746 --> 01:54:54,275
Fight longer than possible?

1335
01:54:54,277 --> 01:54:58,665
Without the most
powerful impulse of the spirit.

1336
01:54:58,666 --> 01:55:01,534
The fear of death.

1337
01:55:01,535 --> 01:55:04,664
I do fear death.

1338
01:55:04,665 --> 01:55:09,765
I fear dying in here,
while my city burns...

1339
01:55:09,768 --> 01:55:13,465
...with no one there to save it.

1340
01:55:14,336 --> 01:55:16,948
Then make the climb.

1341
01:55:21,176 --> 01:55:22,891
How?

1342
01:55:23,810 --> 01:55:26,716
As the child did.

1343
01:55:30,189 --> 01:55:34,180
Without the rope.

1344
01:55:34,182 --> 01:55:38,094
Then fear will find you again.

1345
01:55:43,827 --> 01:55:48,269
Ah, Supplies for your journey?
It's wonderful.

1346
01:55:53,323 --> 01:55:56,843
- What does that mean?
- Rise.

1347
01:55:57,982 --> 01:55:59,459
No.

1348
01:57:29,674 --> 01:57:33,753
There's been a mistake!
Take me to Bane!

1349
01:57:36,127 --> 01:57:38,059
Where's Bane?

1350
01:57:43,885 --> 01:57:45,161
Where's Bane?

1351
01:57:45,162 --> 01:57:50,008
There's been no mistake, Mr. Stryver.
You are Philip Stryver.

1352
01:57:50,010 --> 01:57:53,932
Executive vice-president of
Daggett Industries?

1353
01:57:53,933 --> 01:57:56,918
Who for years
has been living off the blood...

1354
01:57:56,921 --> 01:57:59,973
...and sweat of people
less powerful than him?

1355
01:57:59,974 --> 01:58:03,572
Call Bane!
I'm one of you!

1356
01:58:03,575 --> 01:58:07,650
Bane has no authority here.
This is merely a sentencing hearing.

1357
01:58:07,652 --> 01:58:12,370
Now the choice is yours, exile or death.

1358
01:58:18,648 --> 01:58:21,956
- Exile
- Sold...

1359
01:58:21,959 --> 01:58:24,725
...to the man in the cold sweat!

1360
01:58:31,471 --> 01:58:35,621
You follow the tick ice.
You try to swim... you're dead in minutes.

1361
01:58:35,624 --> 01:58:37,434
Has anyone made it?

1362
01:58:50,927 --> 01:58:51,877
Where the hell are they?

1363
01:58:51,879 --> 01:58:53,580
It's not like we have a lot of time, here.

1364
01:58:53,581 --> 01:58:56,629
- How long?
- The bomb goes off tomorrow.

1365
01:58:56,632 --> 01:58:58,966
And we've got 18 hours to do something.

1366
01:58:58,967 --> 01:58:59,665
To do what?

1367
01:58:59,667 --> 01:59:01,547
To mark that truck.
Get a GPS on it...

1368
01:59:01,549 --> 01:59:04,263
...so we can start to
figure out how to bring it down.

1369
01:59:10,827 --> 01:59:12,524
That's it?

1370
01:59:14,635 --> 01:59:16,765
Foley.

1371
01:59:17,263 --> 01:59:19,968
Where's Foley, dammit?!

1372
01:59:19,971 --> 01:59:22,552
You shouldn't be out on the streets.

1373
01:59:26,057 --> 01:59:27,121
Jim. He's not here.

1374
01:59:27,123 --> 01:59:32,440
You let your wife come to the door
when the city's under occupation?

1375
01:59:32,441 --> 01:59:33,441
Wait in the kitchen, honey.

1376
01:59:33,478 --> 01:59:36,025
What did you do,
bury your uniform in the backyard?

1377
01:59:36,027 --> 01:59:38,294
Jim, you saw what they did
to those Special Forces.

1378
01:59:38,296 --> 01:59:40,673
Have you forgotten all the years
we were out on patrol...

1379
01:59:40,674 --> 01:59:43,623
...when every gangbanger wanting to
plant one as soon as our backs were turned?

1380
01:59:43,626 --> 01:59:46,285
That was different and you know it.
These guys are running the city.

1381
01:59:46,287 --> 01:59:48,078
The government's done a deal with them.

1382
01:59:48,080 --> 01:59:50,907
Bane's got their balls in a vice.
That's not a deal.

1383
01:59:50,910 --> 01:59:53,990
You move on Bane,
the triggerman's gonna hit the button.

1384
01:59:53,991 --> 01:59:58,188
You think he's given control of
that bomb to one of the people?

1385
01:59:58,190 --> 02:00:00,696
You think this is part of some revolution?

1386
02:00:00,698 --> 02:00:03,204
There's one man with
his finger on the button, that's Bane.

1387
02:00:03,206 --> 02:00:06,258
Look, we've all gotta keep our heads down
till they can fix this.

1388
02:00:06,260 --> 02:00:08,594
If you still had family here...

1389
02:00:08,596 --> 02:00:12,278
This only gets fixed from inside the city.

1390
02:00:12,451 --> 02:00:19,257
Look, Peter, I'm not asking you to
walk down Grand in your dress blues.

1391
02:00:19,259 --> 02:00:20,473
But, something has to be done.

1392
02:00:20,584 --> 02:00:22,875
- I'm sorry Jim. I gotta...
- Keep your head down?

1393
02:00:22,877 --> 02:00:26,000
What's that gonna do tomorrow,
when that thing blows?

1394
02:00:26,003 --> 02:00:29,168
You don't know that's gonna happen.

1395
02:00:33,055 --> 02:00:35,854
I hear you're looking for men, Commissioner.

1396
02:00:35,855 --> 02:00:37,253
How about me, instead?

1397
02:00:37,254 --> 02:00:42,947
- Miss take, I can't ask you to do that.
- Please.

1398
02:00:45,872 --> 02:00:47,366
- What did you take?
- I... Nothing.

1399
02:00:47,386 --> 02:00:48,380
I didn't take anything.

1400
02:00:48,380 --> 02:00:50,445
You steal from us, you little bastard?

1401
02:00:51,441 --> 02:00:52,935
Now, you boys know you can't
come into my neighborhood...

1402
02:00:52,936 --> 02:00:54,429
...without asking politely

1403
02:00:58,534 --> 02:01:02,778
Never steal anything
from someone you can't outrun, kid.

1404
02:01:08,122 --> 02:01:11,854
Pretty generous, for a thief.

1405
02:01:19,211 --> 02:01:22,197
- I thought they'd killed you.
- Not yet.

1406
02:01:22,199 --> 02:01:26,649
- If you're expecting an apology...
- It wouldn't suit you.

1407
02:01:26,651 --> 02:01:28,253
I need your help.

1408
02:01:28,256 --> 02:01:32,361
- And why would I help you?
- For this. The "Clean Slate".

1409
02:01:32,362 --> 02:01:36,833
You trust me with that?
After what I did to you?

1410
02:01:36,835 --> 02:01:39,929
I admit I was a little let down.

1411
02:01:41,296 --> 02:01:43,176
But I still think there's more to you.

1412
02:01:43,179 --> 02:01:46,278
In fact, I think that for you,
this isn't just a tool...

1413
02:01:46,279 --> 02:01:50,524
...It's an escape route.
You want to disappear. Start fresh.

1414
02:01:50,528 --> 02:01:52,363
I can't even get off this island.

1415
02:01:52,364 --> 02:01:55,388
I can give you a way off.
Once you get me to Lucius Fox.

1416
02:01:55,391 --> 02:01:59,374
I need you to find out where
they're holding him. Then take me in.

1417
02:02:01,934 --> 02:02:04,414
- Why do you need Fox?
- To save this city.

1418
02:02:04,416 --> 02:02:07,807
Who says it needs saving?
Maybe I like it this way.

1419
02:02:07,808 --> 02:02:10,502
Maybe you do.

1420
02:02:10,505 --> 02:02:13,928
But tomorrow that bomb's going off.

1421
02:02:15,536 --> 02:02:18,757
Get your powerful friend on the case?

1422
02:02:18,760 --> 02:02:21,132
I'm trying. But I need Fox.

1423
02:02:21,199 --> 02:02:25,368
As it approaches, flick the switch.

1424
02:02:25,371 --> 02:02:27,956
The needle hits 200,
you give me the signal...

1425
02:02:27,958 --> 02:02:29,661
...I'll mark the truck. Okay?

1426
02:02:30,461 --> 02:02:32,041
Heads up! Heads up!

1427
02:02:47,928 --> 02:02:50,447
- I got it.
- Mercenaries at your 6.

1428
02:02:50,750 --> 02:02:54,310
Stand still! Keep your hands
where we can see them!

1429
02:02:55,951 --> 02:02:58,717
Commissioner Gordon, you're under arrest.

1430
02:02:58,718 --> 02:03:00,033
On whose authority?

1431
02:03:00,036 --> 02:03:02,245
People of Gotham.

1432
02:03:02,247 --> 02:03:07,377
No lawyer, no witnesses.
What sort of due process is this?

1433
02:03:07,379 --> 02:03:11,106
Your guilt has been determined,
this is merely a sentencing hearing.

1434
02:03:11,108 --> 02:03:13,560
Now what would it be?

1435
02:03:13,563 --> 02:03:16,540
Death or exile?

1436
02:03:16,642 --> 02:03:21,753
Crane, if you think we are
going out onto that ice willingly...

1437
02:03:21,756 --> 02:03:24,454
...you've another think coming.

1438
02:03:25,742 --> 02:03:28,628
- Death, then?
- Looks that way.

1439
02:03:28,629 --> 02:03:32,082
Very well... Death...

1440
02:03:32,688 --> 02:03:35,165
...by exile.

1441
02:03:36,904 --> 02:03:39,384
Bring her to me.

1442
02:03:45,553 --> 02:03:47,564
Hey. Going down. Get things ready.

1443
02:03:47,589 --> 02:03:49,600
Let's gear on.

1444
02:03:56,816 --> 02:03:58,834
Find this one a spot,
he's got a big day tomorrow.

1445
02:03:58,932 --> 02:04:01,743
We all do. It's not every day
you bag Bruce Wayne.

1446
02:04:04,459 --> 02:04:06,079
- Bruce?
- You okay?

1447
02:04:06,081 --> 02:04:08,499
You picked a hell of a time
to go on vacation, Mr. Wayne.

1448
02:04:08,502 --> 02:04:10,306
How long until the core ignites?

1449
02:04:10,307 --> 02:04:12,197
That bomb goes off in 12 hours.

1450
02:04:12,199 --> 02:04:14,881
Unless we can connect it to the reactor.

1451
02:04:14,882 --> 02:04:18,673
- Can you get Miranda out of here?
- Not tonight. I'm sorry.

1452
02:04:18,676 --> 02:04:21,526
- Do what's necessary.
- Tonight I need you.

1453
02:04:21,527 --> 02:04:23,816
- What for?
- To get me back in the game.

1454
02:04:23,818 --> 02:04:28,904
Sorry to spoil things, boys,
but Bane wants these guys to himself.

1455
02:04:30,383 --> 02:04:33,554
- I won't forget about you, Miranda!
- I know.

1456
02:04:42,561 --> 02:04:46,195
- I like your girlfriend, Mr. Wayne.
- He should be so lucky.

1457
02:04:52,512 --> 02:04:57,401
Any move I make against Bane or the bomb,
the triggerman sets it off.

1458
02:04:57,403 --> 02:05:00,476
But, they won't use radio or cell,
too much interference.

1459
02:05:00,478 --> 02:05:02,298
Infrared doesn't have the range.

1460
02:05:02,300 --> 02:05:05,198
It'll have to be a micro-burst, long wave.

1461
02:05:05,200 --> 02:05:07,034
- Could you block it?
- Yes.

1462
02:05:07,036 --> 02:05:11,232
I need the EMP cannon-guidance
mount from the Bat.

1463
02:05:11,233 --> 02:05:13,779
Remember where you parked?

1464
02:05:27,867 --> 02:05:31,326
- She fly okay?
- Yeah.

1465
02:05:31,764 --> 02:05:34,286
Even without the autopilot, thanks.

1466
02:05:34,288 --> 02:05:37,018
Autopilot?
That's what you're there for.

1467
02:06:16,456 --> 02:06:19,119
Thing's clear. Come on, quick! Climb.

1468
02:06:29,326 --> 02:06:30,851
Lock it up!

1469
02:06:35,302 --> 02:06:37,092
Who are you?

1470
02:07:06,065 --> 02:07:08,124
Light it up.

1471
02:07:25,340 --> 02:07:27,351
Mom! Check it out!

1472
02:07:27,617 --> 02:07:29,503
Honey, take a look!

1473
02:07:38,687 --> 02:07:40,939
Impossible.

1474
02:07:41,784 --> 02:07:45,942
Keep her close!
He'll come for her.

1475
02:07:45,945 --> 02:07:50,004
- Where's Miranda Tate?
- Bane took her.

1476
02:07:50,005 --> 02:07:53,467
He's hold up in city hall,
surrounded by his army.

1477
02:07:53,470 --> 02:07:55,928
This blocks the remote detonator
signal to the bomb.

1478
02:07:55,929 --> 02:07:58,386
Get into onto it before by sunrise.

1479
02:07:58,388 --> 02:08:00,756
They might hit the button when it starts.

1480
02:08:00,758 --> 02:08:03,616
- When what starts?
- War.

1481
02:08:39,578 --> 02:08:40,732
You missed a spot.

1482
02:08:43,854 --> 02:08:47,014
If you're working alone,
wear a mask.

1483
02:08:47,016 --> 02:08:49,322
I'm not afraid of being seen
standing up to these guys.

1484
02:08:49,324 --> 02:08:53,113
The mask is not for you.
It's to protect the people you care about.

1485
02:08:53,935 --> 02:08:56,782
Count to 5 and throw.

1486
02:09:06,691 --> 02:09:09,579
Hey, no offense, but you got
something bigger in that belt?

1487
02:09:19,341 --> 02:09:22,243
- What now?
- All-out assault on Bane

1488
02:09:22,245 --> 02:09:25,049
But you need to get the people
across the bridge.

1489
02:09:25,052 --> 02:09:25,770
Why?

1490
02:09:25,771 --> 02:09:30,513
In case we fail. Lead an exodus.
Save as many lives as you can.

1491
02:09:30,514 --> 02:09:35,163
- You don't need me here?
- You've given me an army. Now go.

1492
02:09:35,472 --> 02:09:38,380
- Alright, thanks!
- Don't thank me yet.

1493
02:09:38,383 --> 02:09:41,745
Well, I might not get a chance later.

1494
02:09:54,646 --> 02:09:56,141
You shouldn't have.

1495
02:09:57,375 --> 02:09:59,857
The mid-town tunnel's blocked by debris,

1496
02:09:59,860 --> 02:10:03,260
But the cannons have enough firepower
to make a path for people.

1497
02:10:03,261 --> 02:10:05,089
Wait until the fighting begins!

1498
02:10:05,091 --> 02:10:08,454
You're gonna wage your war
to save your stuck up girlfriend?

1499
02:10:08,456 --> 02:10:10,860
To start it, throttle...

1500
02:10:10,863 --> 02:10:12,122
I got it.

1501
02:10:12,124 --> 02:10:14,595
We've 45 minutes to save this city.

1502
02:10:14,598 --> 02:10:18,272
No, I've got forty-five minutes to
get clear of the blast radius...

1503
02:10:18,308 --> 02:10:19,709
...because you don't
stand a chance against these guys.

1504
02:10:19,711 --> 02:10:21,204
With your help I might.

1505
02:10:21,206 --> 02:10:24,177
I'll open that tunnel,
then I'm gone.

1506
02:10:24,180 --> 02:10:27,804
There's more to you than that.

1507
02:10:29,998 --> 02:10:33,308
Sorry to keep letting you down.

1508
02:10:35,738 --> 02:10:41,030
Come with me. Save yourself.

1509
02:10:42,423 --> 02:10:47,694
You don't owe these people anymore.
You've given them everything.

1510
02:10:47,696 --> 02:10:51,558
Not everything. Not yet.

1511
02:11:31,326 --> 02:11:35,806
Disperse. Disperse or be fired upon.

1512
02:11:36,645 --> 02:11:39,599
There's only one police in this town...

1513
02:12:18,151 --> 02:12:20,196
Open fire.

1514
02:13:11,489 --> 02:13:13,575
- Here it comes.
- Get ready!

1515
02:13:43,114 --> 02:13:47,722
So you came back
to die with your city.

1516
02:13:47,725 --> 02:13:51,771
No. I came back to stop you.

1517
02:14:02,855 --> 02:14:03,966
Now!

1518
02:14:16,988 --> 02:14:18,072
That's impossible!

1519
02:14:19,923 --> 02:14:21,893
Cut over to Fifth!

1520
02:14:36,627 --> 02:14:40,601
Get on the bus, go ahead.
You come with me! You too!

1521
02:14:40,603 --> 02:14:44,007
Hey you, you and you, come here! Come here!

1522
02:14:44,008 --> 02:14:45,962
Everyone else get on the bus, okay?

1523
02:14:45,965 --> 02:14:49,000
You guys, you go Knock on doors,
spread the word, okay?

1524
02:14:49,002 --> 02:14:52,154
The bomb's going to blow! Get out
by the South Street tunnel...

1525
02:14:52,190 --> 02:14:53,287
...or over the bridge!

1526
02:14:53,290 --> 02:14:57,562
You go, you do two blocks, then
get back to the bus! Alright? go, go, go!

1527
02:14:58,364 --> 02:15:02,563
- Is he back?
- Keep your eyes open. Go!

1528
02:16:25,078 --> 02:16:27,280
Cover the doors!

1529
02:16:30,030 --> 02:16:33,178
Where's your trigger? Where is it?

1530
02:16:34,295 --> 02:16:37,694
You'd never give it to an ordinary citizen.

1531
02:16:37,696 --> 02:16:40,321
Where is it?
Where's the trigger?

1532
02:16:40,625 --> 02:16:43,411
Where is it? Where is it?

1533
02:16:51,715 --> 02:16:55,230
Tell me where the trigger is...

1534
02:16:55,232 --> 02:16:58,105
...then, you have my permission to die.

1535
02:17:10,137 --> 02:17:15,261
I broke you.
How have you come back?

1536
02:17:15,263 --> 02:17:19,642
You think you were the only one
who could learn the strength to escape?

1537
02:17:19,644 --> 02:17:24,339
- Where's the trigger?
- But I never escaped.

1538
02:17:25,116 --> 02:17:27,528
But the child...

1539
02:17:28,435 --> 02:17:31,073
...The child of Ra's Al Ghul made the climb.

1540
02:17:31,075 --> 02:17:34,355
But he is not the child of Ra's Al Ghul.

1541
02:17:37,038 --> 02:17:38,961
I am.

1542
02:17:38,963 --> 02:17:44,801
And though I am not ordinary,
I am a citizen.

1543
02:18:04,100 --> 02:18:05,637
Miranda?

1544
02:18:08,062 --> 02:18:09,425
Why?

1545
02:18:09,728 --> 02:18:15,436
Thalia. My mother named me
Talia before she was killed.

1546
02:18:15,438 --> 02:18:21,419
The way I would've been killed
if not for my protector... Bane.

1547
02:18:29,145 --> 02:18:30,263
Goodbye.

1548
02:18:32,395 --> 02:18:35,409
I climbed out of the pit.

1549
02:18:40,455 --> 02:18:43,023
I found my father...

1550
02:18:45,162 --> 02:18:49,085
...and brought him
back to exact terrible vengeance...

1551
02:18:49,087 --> 02:18:51,142
...but by that time...

1552
02:18:51,242 --> 02:18:56,270
...the prisoners and the doctor
had done their work to my friend...

1553
02:18:56,273 --> 02:18:57,572
...my protector.

1554
02:19:01,367 --> 02:19:08,337
The League took us in. Trained us.
But my father could not accept Bane.

1555
02:19:08,338 --> 02:19:12,415
He saw only a monster
Whose very existence...

1556
02:19:12,418 --> 02:19:16,617
...was a reminder of the hell
he'd left his wife to die in.

1557
02:19:16,618 --> 02:19:20,020
He excommunicated Bane
from the League of Shadows.

1558
02:19:20,022 --> 02:19:25,361
His only crime was that he loved me.

1559
02:19:26,578 --> 02:19:30,298
I could not truly forgive my father.

1560
02:19:33,969 --> 02:19:36,547
Until you murdered him.

1561
02:19:53,669 --> 02:19:59,161
He was trying to
kill millions of innocent people.

1562
02:19:59,197 --> 02:20:04,356
"Innocent" is a strong word to
throw around Gotham, Bruce.

1563
02:20:05,753 --> 02:20:09,526
I honor my father by finishing his work.

1564
02:20:20,940 --> 02:20:23,663
Vengeance against the man who killed him...

1565
02:20:23,665 --> 02:20:26,682
...is simply a reward for my patience.

1566
02:20:27,707 --> 02:20:28,997
You see...

1567
02:20:29,951 --> 02:20:35,051
...it's the slow knife...
the knife that takes its time...

1568
02:20:38,102 --> 02:20:43,766
The knife that waits
years without forgetting...

1569
02:20:43,768 --> 02:20:48,287
...then slips quietly between bones...

1570
02:20:48,288 --> 02:20:52,826
...that's the knife that cuts deepest.

1571
02:20:52,894 --> 02:20:54,656
Please!

1572
02:21:01,562 --> 02:21:05,513
Maybe your knife was too slow.

1573
02:21:05,573 --> 02:21:07,630
The truck's under attack.

1574
02:21:07,631 --> 02:21:11,082
Gordon. You gave him
a way to block my signal.

1575
02:21:11,386 --> 02:21:13,387
No matter.

1576
02:21:15,205 --> 02:21:18,266
He's bought Gotham 11 minutes.

1577
02:21:22,011 --> 02:21:24,022
Come on!

1578
02:21:31,068 --> 02:21:33,099
Stay there! What are you doing?

1579
02:21:33,100 --> 02:21:36,690
Blake, MCU,
I'm getting these boys to safety.

1580
02:21:36,692 --> 02:21:38,661
You're gonna get us both all killed.

1581
02:21:38,664 --> 02:21:41,815
Anyone crosses this bridge
they'll blow the city.

1582
02:21:41,817 --> 02:21:45,027
It's gonna blow anyway.
We need to open this bridge now.

1583
02:21:45,028 --> 02:21:48,821
Detective, if you take one step forward,
we will shoot you.

1584
02:21:48,824 --> 02:21:52,617
If you take two steps forward,
we will blow the bridge.

1585
02:21:54,612 --> 02:21:58,166
Go back by the bus and wait for me, alright?
Just go back and wait.

1586
02:22:01,182 --> 02:22:02,714
Prepare a convoy.

1587
02:22:02,715 --> 02:22:05,423
We must secure the bomb
until it detonates.

1588
02:22:06,300 --> 02:22:11,805
Don't kill him.
I want him to feel the heat.

1589
02:22:11,841 --> 02:22:14,687
Feel the fire of
12 million souls

1590
02:22:14,722 --> 02:22:16,036
you failed.

1591
02:22:21,676 --> 02:22:24,261
Goodbye, my friend.

1592
02:22:33,490 --> 02:22:36,910
Keep moving forward!
Block them in the stairs!

1593
02:22:45,262 --> 02:22:46,621
Shoot them!

1594
02:22:47,608 --> 02:22:49,429
Shoot them all!

1595
02:22:58,529 --> 02:23:02,335
We both know that I have to kill you now.

1596
02:23:04,860 --> 02:23:07,750
You'll just have to imagine the fire.

1597
02:23:15,176 --> 02:23:17,561
About the whole no-guns thing?

1598
02:23:17,563 --> 02:23:21,616
I don't feel as strongly about it as you do.

1599
02:23:34,547 --> 02:23:35,755
Pull up!

1600
02:23:39,031 --> 02:23:40,695
Stay level.

1601
02:23:53,052 --> 02:23:56,628
We have to force that convoy east,
to the entrance to the reactor.

1602
02:23:57,970 --> 02:24:01,256
I need you on the ground,
I'll be in the air. Go!

1603
02:24:01,258 --> 02:24:05,233
The situation's changed!
Your orders are out of date!

1604
02:24:05,236 --> 02:24:09,362
I'm a cop like you.
And I'm walking out there.

1605
02:24:09,363 --> 02:24:12,762
Please do not shoot me.

1606
02:24:13,882 --> 02:24:15,392
Shoot at his feet.

1607
02:24:24,895 --> 02:24:27,402
Nothing like a little air superiority.

1608
02:24:27,405 --> 02:24:32,880
Detective, please stop!
Please, detective! Stop!

1609
02:24:32,882 --> 02:24:38,765
Stop walking! Blow it! Do it!

1610
02:24:50,336 --> 02:24:53,858
You have to get that bomb here
and you got ten minutes.

1611
02:25:03,563 --> 02:25:06,404
They're pushing us
to the entrance of the reactor.

1612
02:25:06,405 --> 02:25:08,855
They're gonna try to
reconnect the core.

1613
02:25:08,882 --> 02:25:10,893
You idiots!

1614
02:25:11,664 --> 02:25:17,468
You sons of bitches! You're killing us!
Just follow your orders!

1615
02:25:17,868 --> 02:25:20,058
Alright boys get in circle,
bow your heads.

1616
02:25:22,284 --> 02:25:23,953
Not much longer.

1617
02:26:12,930 --> 02:26:15,361
Let's get everyone back in the bus.
Okay?

1618
02:26:15,362 --> 02:26:16,902
Go! Go! Back in the bus.

1619
02:26:16,904 --> 02:26:19,858
There's nowhere to go!

1620
02:26:19,860 --> 02:26:21,697
On the bus!

1621
02:27:17,921 --> 02:27:21,350
You got to the truck east!

1622
02:27:25,096 --> 02:27:26,591
Stay straight!

1623
02:27:58,832 --> 02:28:02,165
Give me a hand!
We can get a cable on it!

1624
02:28:08,963 --> 02:28:13,077
Fox showed me how to
operate the reactor core.

1625
02:28:15,545 --> 02:28:17,182
Oh, dear.

1626
02:28:20,500 --> 02:28:24,061
Including the emergency flood.

1627
02:28:40,621 --> 02:28:47,681
There is no way this bomb will be stopped.

1628
02:28:47,911 --> 02:28:49,512
What're you doing?

1629
02:28:49,717 --> 02:28:50,660
Protection from the blast!

1630
02:28:50,661 --> 02:28:52,074
We're gonna be alright!
Double time! Go!

1631
02:28:52,077 --> 02:28:53,383
It's an atom bomb!

1632
02:28:53,384 --> 02:28:54,961
You think they need to
hear that right now?

1633
02:28:54,963 --> 02:28:56,431
You want to let them
die without hope? Come on!

1634
02:28:57,282 --> 02:29:00,150
Prepare yourselves.

1635
02:29:00,151 --> 02:29:06,302
My father's work is done.

1636
02:29:11,549 --> 02:29:14,683
- What're you doing?
- I can fly it out over the bay.

1637
02:29:14,685 --> 02:29:18,736
- Set it to fly head over the water then eject?
- No autopilot.

1638
02:29:20,716 --> 02:29:24,177
You could've gone anywhere.
Been anything. But you came back here.

1639
02:29:24,179 --> 02:29:28,474
- So did you.
- I guess we're both suckers.

1640
02:29:35,496 --> 02:29:38,586
- I never cared who you were
- And you were right.

1641
02:29:38,587 --> 02:29:41,247
But shouldn't the people know
the hero who saved them?

1642
02:29:41,249 --> 02:29:42,574
A hero can be anyone.

1643
02:29:42,577 --> 02:29:45,343
Even a man doing something as simple...

1644
02:29:45,344 --> 02:29:48,246
...and reassuring as putting a coat
around a little boy's shoulders...

1645
02:29:48,248 --> 02:29:51,530
...to let him know the
world hadn't ended.

1646
02:30:09,279 --> 02:30:11,136
Bruce Wayne?

1647
02:30:24,920 --> 02:30:27,638
Vlad, they go! You too!
Come on, father.

1648
02:30:46,795 --> 02:30:49,033
Hey, heads down! This is it!

1649
02:30:50,875 --> 02:30:52,695
No. No. That's Batman!

1650
02:31:40,376 --> 02:31:42,335
That's detonation!

1651
02:31:49,491 --> 02:31:52,444
It's out over the bays,
clear of the city.

1652
02:32:11,335 --> 02:32:13,983
"I see a beautiful city...

1653
02:32:13,985 --> 02:32:19,418
"... and a brilliant people
rising from this abyss...

1654
02:32:19,420 --> 02:32:24,162
"I see the lives for which
I lay down my life...

1655
02:32:24,164 --> 02:32:30,298
"... peaceful, useful,
prosperous and happy...

1656
02:32:31,954 --> 02:32:36,445
"I see that I hold a sanctuary in
their hearts...

1657
02:32:37,158 --> 02:32:40,508
"... and in the hearts of
their descendants...

1658
02:32:41,422 --> 02:32:43,859
"... generations hence.

1659
02:32:46,049 --> 02:32:50,252
"It is a far, far better thing that I do...

1660
02:32:51,250 --> 02:32:53,651
"... than I have ever done...

1661
02:32:53,654 --> 02:32:58,450
"It is a far,
far better rest that I go to...

1662
02:33:01,488 --> 02:33:04,332
"... than I have ever known. "

1663
02:33:22,032 --> 02:33:26,231
I'm so sorry.
I failed you.

1664
02:33:27,376 --> 02:33:29,621
You trusted me...

1665
02:33:30,537 --> 02:33:32,914
...and I failed you.

1666
02:33:35,459 --> 02:33:38,512
Can I change your mind...

1667
02:33:40,139 --> 02:33:42,768
...about quitting the force?

1668
02:33:42,770 --> 02:33:47,047
You know what you said about
structures becoming shackles.

1669
02:33:47,049 --> 02:33:50,952
You were right and I can't take it.
The injustice.

1670
02:33:52,601 --> 02:33:55,528
I mean... no one's ever gonna know
who saved an entire city.

1671
02:33:55,529 --> 02:33:57,769
They know.

1672
02:33:58,670 --> 02:34:01,403
It was the Batman.

1673
02:34:18,453 --> 02:34:22,662
Mr. Wayne's will was not amended to
reflect his more modest estate.

1674
02:34:22,663 --> 02:34:25,685
Nonetheless, there are
considerable assets to dispose of.

1675
02:34:25,687 --> 02:34:29,761
The contents of the house are to be
sold to settle the estate's accounts...

1676
02:34:29,763 --> 02:34:34,835
...and the remainder is left in its
entirety to Alfred J. Pennyworth.

1677
02:34:35,975 --> 02:34:40,128
The house and grounds are left to
the city of Gotham, on condition...

1678
02:34:40,129 --> 02:34:44,218
...that they never be demolished,
altered, or otherwise interfered with.

1679
02:34:44,220 --> 02:34:49,267
...and that they shall be used for one
purpose, and one purpose only...

1680
02:34:50,210 --> 02:34:55,066
The housing and care of the city's
at-risk and orphaned children.

1681
02:34:55,068 --> 02:34:57,107
My clerk will help anyone with...

1682
02:34:57,109 --> 02:34:59,784
...the smaller
correspondences and instructions.

1683
02:34:59,787 --> 02:35:02,623
- Blake, John?
- Nothing here.

1684
02:35:02,649 --> 02:35:03,771
Alright, eh...

1685
02:35:03,772 --> 02:35:05,642
Try my legal name.

1686
02:35:08,323 --> 02:35:12,232
You should use your full name.
I like that name... Robin.

1687
02:35:12,234 --> 02:35:13,468
Thanks!

1688
02:35:13,471 --> 02:35:15,228
Why are we even worrying
about the stabilization software?

1689
02:35:15,229 --> 02:35:18,019
This entire autopilot system
is completely obsolete.

1690
02:35:18,021 --> 02:35:22,014
Please, I just need to know
what I could've done to fix it.

1691
02:35:22,017 --> 02:35:26,233
But Mr. Fox, it's already been fixed.
Software patch... Six months ago.

1692
02:35:26,234 --> 02:35:28,906
Check The ID on the patch.

1693
02:35:30,951 --> 02:35:33,059
Bruce Wayne.

1694
02:35:33,061 --> 02:35:36,012
- Any news in the missing item?
- Not yet.

1695
02:35:36,015 --> 02:35:37,697
Well, they'd better leave
no stone unturned...

1696
02:35:37,800 --> 02:35:40,964
We can't leave a string of pearls
on the manifest as "lost".

1697
02:37:07,643 --> 02:37:18,804
The End
