So, this expert fIying from New York.
You want me to pick him up at the
airport?

151
00:09:54,363 --> 00:09:56,354
There's nobody coming in.

152
00:09:57,616 --> 00:10:00,494
The best camera experts in the worId are
right here in HoIIywood.

153
00:10:02,911 --> 00:10:04,902
Nice, you know what?

154
00:10:05,957 --> 00:10:07,948
You wouId've done aIright on the
streets.

155
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,077
Shit. . . What do you think I am,
EarI?

156
00:10:34,059 --> 00:10:35,048
Louis RouIet?

157
00:10:35,227 --> 00:10:36,216
Yes.

158
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:39,340
I'm MichaeI HaIIer.

159
00:10:39,396 --> 00:10:43,184
Mr. HaIIer. Our guy caIIed you because
I need someone.

160
00:10:43,358 --> 00:10:44,427
This whoIe thing is a set-up.

161
00:10:44,525 --> 00:10:46,595
I made a mistake with that woman and she
was setting me up. . .

162
00:10:46,693 --> 00:10:48,570
Keep your voice down, hear me?

163
00:10:48,652 --> 00:10:51,689
Don't say anything about the case,
untiI I get you out on baiI.

164
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:55,748
I understand your famiIy Iawyer's in
court?

165
00:10:55,868 --> 00:10:57,859
Yes, his name's CeciI Dobbs.

166
00:10:58,162 --> 00:11:00,960
- He's here somewhere. - I'II find him.

167
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,189
TeII me about yourseIf.

168
00:11:02,247 --> 00:11:05,159
- How oId are you? - 32.

169
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,407
Ties to community? Did you grow up here?

170
00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:10,535
Yeah, BeverIy HiIIs. Went to USC.

171
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,547
Work for my mother's business.

172
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,699
What about your father?

173
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,550
He died when I was 2.

174
00:11:16,924 --> 00:11:18,915
How much did you make Iast year, Louis?

175
00:11:19,008 --> 00:11:20,964
The taxes said $600, 000.

176
00:11:21,969 --> 00:11:23,038
I want a Iawyer too.

177
00:11:23,095 --> 00:11:25,051
My name's CorIiss. Who's this?

178
00:11:25,181 --> 00:11:28,173
- You got a card on you? - Listen,
buddy, they have a Iawyer for you out
there.

179
00:11:29,266 --> 00:11:31,416
Right now, I need you to back away and
give us a IittIe space.

180
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,555
Can you do that, paI?

181
00:11:36,688 --> 00:11:38,519
I'm backing, boss.

182
00:11:38,606 --> 00:11:39,721
Here we go. AII good.

183
00:11:40,818 --> 00:11:41,807
There we go.

184
00:11:41,859 --> 00:11:42,894
There we go.

185
00:11:43,902 --> 00:11:44,937
Now, Iisten, they've uh. . .

186
00:11:45,028 --> 00:11:47,826
Put some heavy charges on you, Louis.

187
00:11:47,946 --> 00:11:49,937
The DA's probabIy gonna ask for no baiI.

188
00:11:50,031 --> 00:11:52,147
- No baiI? - I said they're gonna ask
for it.

189
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,191
When was the Iast time you were
arrested?

190
00:11:55,284 --> 00:11:58,321
- Never. - So, if I check your record.
. .

191
00:11:58,456 --> 00:11:59,491
You'd find parking tickets.

192
00:12:00,499 --> 00:12:01,568
Are you gonna get me out of here?

193
00:12:01,624 --> 00:12:03,501
I'm gonna try, Louis.

194
00:12:11,005 --> 00:12:13,997
Are you the prosecutor who used to have
the RouIet's case?

195
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:16,290
HaIIer.

196
00:12:18,261 --> 00:12:19,250
Son of a bitch.

197
00:12:19,304 --> 00:12:20,339
RuIes are ruIes.

198
00:12:20,388 --> 00:12:24,267
I wanted this one. Okay, okay, I'II
go quIetIy.

199
00:12:25,516 --> 00:12:27,666
But after today's hearing, if you don't
object. . .

200
00:12:27,768 --> 00:12:28,803
Depends.

201
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:30,759
You going for no baiI?

202
00:12:30,854 --> 00:12:33,732
That won't change with the prosecutor.

203
00:12:33,896 --> 00:12:35,887
Not after what your guy did.

204
00:12:35,983 --> 00:12:37,018
If he didn't?

205
00:12:37,067 --> 00:12:38,136
Sure 'if'.

206
00:12:38,192 --> 00:12:42,105
BaiIey picked him in her home with bIood
aII over him.

207
00:12:42,278 --> 00:12:44,189
I Iove it when you get sarcastic.

208
00:12:45,489 --> 00:12:47,366
Can I see the arrest report?

209
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,441
You get it from whomever takes over.

210
00:12:50,534 --> 00:12:51,603
No favours on this one.

211
00:12:53,828 --> 00:12:55,705
How's HayIey today?

212
00:12:57,831 --> 00:12:58,866
She's good.

213
00:12:58,915 --> 00:12:59,904
Good.

214
00:13:01,042 --> 00:13:03,033
I'II pick her up the usuaI time on
Saturday.

215
00:13:04,171 --> 00:13:06,048
Because of the seriousness of the
offence. . .

216
00:13:06,173 --> 00:13:08,243
The financiaI resources of the accused.
. .

217
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,455
The State requests no baiI.

218
00:13:09,507 --> 00:13:13,341
Your Honour, there's no way the State
can cIaim that my cIient is a fIight
risk.

219
00:13:13,552 --> 00:13:17,511
- He's not. - With resources Iike this
man has, fIight is aIways risk.

220
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:18,794
- Are there any priors? - No, Your
Honour.

221
00:13:18,847 --> 00:13:22,806
Then, I'm gonna reduce the risk of
fIight by ordering him to a tracer
ankIet. . .

222
00:13:23,017 --> 00:13:25,929
And I'm gonna set baiI at $1 miIIion.

223
00:13:26,061 --> 00:13:29,133
- Judge, have you seen the photo? - Ms.
McPherson, the baiI is set.

224
00:13:29,313 --> 00:13:30,302
Thank you, Judge.

225
00:13:32,441 --> 00:13:37,310
Mick, feeIing Iike to thank me and
speak good of me? 'Cos this one's gonna
be the money, I'm teIIing you.

226
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:40,642
- We'II see, we'II see. - This is the
Iawyer right there, CeciI Dobbs.

227
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:41,768
Hey, Mick, don't forget our deaI.

228
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,860
. . . He's here now. I'II taIk to you
Iater.

229
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,028
- CeciI Dobbs. - Mr. HaIIer.

230
00:13:52,038 --> 00:13:54,188
Depressing to see the boy caught up in
that kettIe caII.

231
00:13:54,289 --> 00:13:56,166
The boy?

232
00:13:57,334 --> 00:13:59,325
I represent the famiIy for a Iong time.

233
00:13:59,417 --> 00:14:02,454
Listen, my advice is, Iet VaI fix you
up the bond.

234
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:04,540
And you, take the boy home.

235
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,621
WeII, we were thinking of putting up
property.

236
00:14:06,714 --> 00:14:07,829
There's the Windsors beach house.

237
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:08,870
Mother's name is Windsor?

238
00:14:09,842 --> 00:14:10,911
Her second husband's name.

239
00:14:11,012 --> 00:14:11,967
He's dead now.

240
00:14:12,888 --> 00:14:14,003
Assessing the house couId take days.

241
00:14:14,096 --> 00:14:16,894
Trust me, you don't want the boy in the
cIean CIeveIand that Iong.

242
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:20,094
So, tap VaI. Take Louis to your
office. . .

243
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:21,261
I'II meet you there at 4.

244
00:14:21,435 --> 00:14:23,266
Here, Iet me give you my business card.

245
00:14:26,438 --> 00:14:27,427
Oh boy.

246
00:14:28,523 --> 00:14:29,512
Media?

247
00:14:29,733 --> 00:14:31,564
Yeah, that'II be on us.

248
00:14:31,692 --> 00:14:34,843
Mrs. Windsor's sensitive about the
press.

249
00:14:35,862 --> 00:14:37,818
I guess there's much we can do about
that.

250
00:14:39,031 --> 00:14:40,020
We'II see.

251
00:14:41,074 --> 00:14:42,063
Say, Bob!

252
00:14:42,116 --> 00:14:43,231
Come here. Come here.

253
00:14:44,202 --> 00:14:46,193
Saw you fiIming in there. What's your
name?

254
00:14:46,327 --> 00:14:48,238
Name's Rob GiIIan. They caII me
'Sticks'.

255
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,479
Sticks, you freeIancing on this?

256
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:52,492
Yeah, your cIient's got profiIe,
figure I'II seII to IocaI news.

257
00:14:52,623 --> 00:14:54,500
- How much? - How much what?

258
00:14:54,584 --> 00:14:56,540
How much they pay you for what you shot
in there?

259
00:14:56,626 --> 00:14:57,695
Uh. . . That depends.

260
00:14:57,794 --> 00:14:59,671
7. . . 750?

261
00:15:00,004 --> 00:15:01,835
How about we take it off your hands. . .

262
00:15:01,964 --> 00:15:04,080
For 8? No?

263
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:06,079
Too short?

264
00:15:06,175 --> 00:15:08,006
AIright, Iet's make it a grand.

265
00:15:08,135 --> 00:15:09,329
- DeaI? - It's yours.

266
00:15:10,177 --> 00:15:13,328
- So, I can expense this, right? - Of
course.

267
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:14,502
AbsoIuteIy.

268
00:15:14,555 --> 00:15:16,432
Thank you, Sticks.

269
00:15:16,518 --> 00:15:17,507
Thank you.

270
00:15:18,686 --> 00:15:21,519
You know, Mr. HaIIer. . . You weren't
my choice.

271
00:15:21,646 --> 00:15:22,635
Bet I wasn't.

272
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:24,846
Firms Iike yours must have some heavy
hitters on caII.

273
00:15:24,981 --> 00:15:26,937
We do, but Louis insisted.

274
00:15:27,984 --> 00:15:29,975
FrankIy, I've never heard of you.

275
00:15:30,068 --> 00:15:32,104
But uh. . . Maybe I shouId have.

276
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:35,189
Did you say I was Louis' choice?

277
00:15:35,323 --> 00:15:37,359
Yes, he read about a case you had.

278
00:15:41,451 --> 00:15:44,443
I need a hundred grand upfront.
Working at $550 an hour. . .

279
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:45,648
Another hundred if we go to triaI.

280
00:15:45,747 --> 00:15:46,782
The motion goes pass a week.

281
00:15:46,872 --> 00:15:49,750
AppeaIs, we start over.

282
00:15:53,043 --> 00:15:54,158
I take it that's no probIem?

283
00:15:55,129 --> 00:15:57,006
- No. - See you at 4.

284
00:16:10,847 --> 00:16:12,678
Where are we heading now?

285
00:16:12,933 --> 00:16:14,924
We gotta go and meet Sticks at Jim's.

286
00:16:15,894 --> 00:16:17,850
- The same spot? - Hm-hm.

287
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:18,966
AIright.

288
00:16:31,697 --> 00:16:32,686
There he is.

289
00:16:33,824 --> 00:16:34,813
There we go.

290
00:16:34,865 --> 00:16:37,663
Eight for me, two for you.

291
00:16:37,827 --> 00:16:38,896
- Thanks, Sticks. - Anytime.

292
00:16:38,953 --> 00:16:40,909
- Hm-hm. . . - Hey, hey, my tape!

293
00:17:11,184 --> 00:17:13,175
You don't Iook good, girI.

294
00:17:13,311 --> 00:17:14,300
Thanks.

295
00:17:16,354 --> 00:17:17,389
Something new?

296
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,475
Booked on possession of coke?

297
00:17:19,607 --> 00:17:20,642
PIus the usuaI.

298
00:17:20,691 --> 00:17:22,682
I know, it's dumb, it's. . .

299
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:25,767
A guy paid me with it and I had it on me
when I went to the next.

300
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:27,821
And the next was a cop?

301
00:17:28,029 --> 00:17:29,018
Yeah.

302
00:17:31,034 --> 00:17:32,149
Look, can't you get me one of those. .
.

303
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,953
Rehab pIaces that get you straight?

304
00:17:35,077 --> 00:17:38,308
We did a pre-chiId rehab Iast time. The
DA's never gonna go for it again.

305
00:17:38,455 --> 00:17:42,243
- You may have to do some jaiI time,
GIoria. - I can't.

306
00:17:42,456 --> 00:17:45,573
Yes you can. Yes. . . You can.

307
00:17:46,709 --> 00:17:50,588
Hey. . . They have programs in jaiI too.

308
00:17:50,922 --> 00:17:52,753
Look, you've had a Iong run.

309
00:17:53,006 --> 00:17:54,962
Maybe after this you'II get a Iife.

310
00:17:57,134 --> 00:17:58,123
Yeah.

311
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,216
Housewife of the year. That's me.

312
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:04,261
Maybe I can turn some tricks for the
PTA.

313
00:18:06,433 --> 00:18:09,425
- It's not funny. - I'd Iike to see
that.

314
00:18:09,685 --> 00:18:11,596
AIright, aIright, give it to me.

315
00:18:12,645 --> 00:18:13,839
AIright, I uh. . .

316
00:18:13,895 --> 00:18:16,728
I did a guy at the TraveIIer's at Santa
Monica.

317
00:18:16,858 --> 00:18:18,894
A guy who paid you with coke instead of
money?

318
00:18:19,025 --> 00:18:22,017
Yeah, and he had a show of coke in
there, I saw it.

319
00:18:23,111 --> 00:18:25,102
- You know him? - No.

320
00:18:25,197 --> 00:18:27,188
He reached me from my website. He was
uh. . .

321
00:18:28,448 --> 00:18:30,279
He's Mexican or something.

322
00:18:30,366 --> 00:18:31,401
Did you screen him?

323
00:18:31,492 --> 00:18:32,561
Oh, I screened them aII.

324
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,571
Okay, with what? His driver's Iicence?

325
00:18:34,663 --> 00:18:36,574
His passport. It was uh. . .

326
00:18:36,706 --> 00:18:38,742
His name uh. . .

327
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,866
- His name's Hector. - Hector what?

328
00:18:43,001 --> 00:18:44,912
- Um. . . - What's his Iast name?

329
00:18:45,003 --> 00:18:45,958
Think, GIoria, think.

330
00:18:46,129 --> 00:18:50,088
Hector Arande Moya's what you get if you
run a trace.

331
00:18:50,258 --> 00:18:52,294
He's a fugitive from a the grand jury
down in FIorida.

332
00:18:52,383 --> 00:18:54,339
The DA wants him for drug trafficking.

333
00:18:54,469 --> 00:18:57,381
And LesIie, they want him a Iot.

334
00:18:57,512 --> 00:18:59,468
And your girI's Iooking to trade?

335
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:01,553
She gives you his hoteI and room number.

336
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,632
- She'II aIso testify on the coke? - No,
Iocation onIy.

337
00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:05,924
You guys take it from there.

338
00:19:05,977 --> 00:19:08,935
My best guess is that Hector hasn't
checked out yet.

339
00:19:11,022 --> 00:19:12,091
And in exchange?

340
00:19:12,189 --> 00:19:16,023
You drop aII charges, aII she does is a
pre-chiId rehab.

341
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:18,395
The faciIity at the USC Med wouId be
nice.

342
00:19:19,569 --> 00:19:21,446
Or I can take it to the Feds.

343
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:23,606
They'II cut this deaI in a minute.

344
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:30,741
AIright, you fucking asshoIe.

345
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:33,068
After you.

346
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:38,030
- You'd go head first? - I'd give it a
shot if I was gonna do it.

347
00:19:38,207 --> 00:19:40,243
- Why? - Star points.

348
00:19:40,334 --> 00:19:43,246
You're so vain, nobody cares if you
kiII yourseIf.

349
00:19:43,422 --> 00:19:47,335
It'II Iook cooI. What do you think the
Iast thing that'd go through your mind
wouId be?

350
00:19:48,591 --> 00:19:49,580
Your asshoIe.

351
00:19:51,677 --> 00:19:52,666
Mr. HaIIer.

352
00:19:52,719 --> 00:19:53,913
Louis, good morning.

353
00:19:54,971 --> 00:19:56,962
- Thank you. - It's just a start.

354
00:19:57,057 --> 00:19:59,890
This is Frank Levin. Frank's my
investigator.

355
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:02,015
- Louis RouIet. - Good to meet you.

356
00:20:02,185 --> 00:20:03,220
We're in here.

357
00:20:05,395 --> 00:20:07,386
Got a. . . tracer ankIet.

358
00:20:07,479 --> 00:20:10,471
A present from your friend, VaI
VaIenzueIa by the order of the court.

359
00:20:10,607 --> 00:20:13,519
As if I'd go any pIace before this
thing's over.

360
00:20:13,693 --> 00:20:14,728
GentIemen, weIcome.

361
00:20:14,777 --> 00:20:16,654
- Mr. Dobbs. - Mr. HaIIer.

362
00:20:16,737 --> 00:20:17,852
Good to see you. This is Frank Levin.

363
00:20:17,904 --> 00:20:21,783
Mr. Levin is my investigator. His fees
are in addition to mine.

364
00:20:21,948 --> 00:20:23,017
Of course.

365
00:20:23,116 --> 00:20:26,028
GentIemen, this is Mary Windsor. She's
Louis' mother.

366
00:20:26,201 --> 00:20:28,157
- Mr. HaIIer. - Mrs. Windsor.

367
00:20:28,246 --> 00:20:30,157
- PIeasure to meet you. - How do you
do?

368
00:20:30,289 --> 00:20:32,439
Fine, thank you. This is Frank Levin,
my investigator.

369
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,337
How do you do?

370
00:20:37,543 --> 00:20:39,579
The charges against my son are
ridicuIous.

371
00:20:39,795 --> 00:20:40,830
So is that woman.

372
00:20:40,879 --> 00:20:43,677
Here's a cheque for you, Mr. HaIIer.

373
00:20:44,841 --> 00:20:46,957
This is going to have to come from your
son, Mrs. Windsor.

374
00:20:47,052 --> 00:20:49,964
You can give him the money, he can
write the cheque.

375
00:20:50,096 --> 00:20:51,165
But it must come from him.

376
00:20:51,263 --> 00:20:53,140
He's my cIient.

377
00:20:53,264 --> 00:20:54,379
And I have to be cIear from the start.

378
00:20:59,642 --> 00:21:02,475
I can't thank you enough for being here.

379
00:21:02,604 --> 00:21:05,562
SincereIy, it's good to know that
you're gonna be there.

380
00:21:05,732 --> 00:21:06,847
When we need you.

381
00:21:06,942 --> 00:21:08,898
But not now? Is that it?

382
00:21:09,858 --> 00:21:13,055
No, ma'am. The DA can make you testify
about what you hear.

383
00:21:13,194 --> 00:21:16,072
Attorney priviIedge does not cover you.

384
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:21,281
I'II see you at home.

385
00:21:26,705 --> 00:21:28,696
She's not used to being toId what to do.

386
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:30,666
I can beIieve that.

387
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,701
So, how fast can I go to triaI?

388
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:33,902
I want this behind me.

389
00:21:34,878 --> 00:21:35,867
Are you sure?

390
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,911
You can stretch it out and enjoy your
freedom.

391
00:21:38,004 --> 00:21:40,120
- Most cIients choose to. . . - GuiIty.
. . cIients, you mean.

392
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:45,252
Okay, then I insist on going to triaI
right away.

393
00:21:45,385 --> 00:21:48,263
Or perhaps, it never goes to triaI at
aII?

394
00:21:48,386 --> 00:21:50,422
My firm can bring uh. . .

395
00:21:50,639 --> 00:21:52,516
ConsiderabIe infIuence to Bear.

396
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,794
Oh, don't kid yourseIf, CeciI.

397
00:21:53,851 --> 00:21:57,605
There's no way the State's dropping
these charges.

398
00:21:57,895 --> 00:22:01,968
As a matter of fact, they've aIready
upped them to the negotiating position.

399
00:22:02,148 --> 00:22:04,025
There won't be any negotiating.

400
00:22:04,107 --> 00:22:06,098
No pIea bargain, no nothing.

401
00:22:06,233 --> 00:22:09,225
I'm not going to jaiI for something I
didn't do.

402
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:10,396
I'm innocent.

403
00:22:10,487 --> 00:22:13,524
And if there is a triaI, I wanna take
the stand and teII the jury. . .

404
00:22:13,657 --> 00:22:14,646
That I'm innocent.

405
00:22:15,616 --> 00:22:17,686
Now, if that's a probIem, we can part
company right now.

406
00:22:20,785 --> 00:22:22,776
Time to teII me what happened.

407
00:22:23,957 --> 00:22:25,948
I was having a drink at The Association.

408
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,918
The Association? The bar on 6th Street?

409
00:22:29,043 --> 00:22:30,192
The one with a Iot of young women?

410
00:22:30,292 --> 00:22:33,125
Right. Good for pick-ups.

411
00:22:33,254 --> 00:22:36,246
What's the fiIe say about the girI,
Frank?

412
00:22:36,506 --> 00:22:39,498
Uh. . . Regina Campo.

413
00:22:39,631 --> 00:22:41,508
Known as Reggie, 26 years oId.

414
00:22:41,635 --> 00:22:43,705
Part time actress, part time office
temp.

415
00:22:43,803 --> 00:22:46,636
And hoping to retire after suing my
cIient.

416
00:22:46,805 --> 00:22:47,954
Did you know her before Iast night,
Louis?

417
00:22:48,055 --> 00:22:50,046
No. I've seen her around, but. . .

418
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:53,098
We never spoke. She was aIways with
another guy.

419
00:22:54,101 --> 00:22:55,136
Last night too.

420
00:22:56,311 --> 00:22:58,302
I got it that she wasn't into her date.

421
00:23:01,484 --> 00:23:05,397
She brushed by me on her way to the
bathroom.

422
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:10,856
She basicaIIy just Iaid her address on
me, on a napkin.

423
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,867
She said she couId get rid of him by 10.

424
00:23:12,948 --> 00:23:14,939
Do you stiII have it? What she wrote
down?

425
00:23:15,077 --> 00:23:16,988
No, I didn't keep the napkin.

426
00:23:17,077 --> 00:23:20,114
Check the fiIe. See if the poIice
report has any of this.

427
00:23:20,247 --> 00:23:24,126
Frank here has aIready worked us a
IittIe miracIe.

428
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:27,408
He uh. . . happened to score us a copy
of the discovery fiIe.

429
00:23:27,585 --> 00:23:29,496
Everything the DA has.

430
00:23:29,671 --> 00:23:32,629
They wouId have had to turn it over
eventuaIIy, but it wouId've taken a
whiIe.

431
00:23:32,756 --> 00:23:34,712
No, they don't have the other guy.

432
00:23:34,841 --> 00:23:35,910
They don't even have the bar.

433
00:23:35,965 --> 00:23:38,923
So, what? AII they've got is Louis
shows up at her apartment. . .

434
00:23:39,052 --> 00:23:41,088
And she gets beaten?

435
00:23:41,177 --> 00:23:43,088
That is such buIIshit.

436
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:45,291
Just keep teIIing me your story.

437
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,339
Okay.

438
00:23:48,476 --> 00:23:50,307
I got there earIy.

439
00:23:50,518 --> 00:23:54,397
And uh, waited untiI he came out.

440
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,139
Did you see what he was driving?

441
00:24:06,031 --> 00:24:07,020
A bIue mustang.

442
00:24:26,838 --> 00:24:28,829
AIright, so he comes out, you go in?

443
00:24:29,172 --> 00:24:31,003
She saw it was me.

444
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:32,159
And opened the door.

445
00:24:32,257 --> 00:24:36,091
Uh. . . the haIIway was tight.

446
00:24:36,261 --> 00:24:39,298
So I had to. . . waIk pass her, you
know. . .

447
00:24:39,471 --> 00:24:40,586
She cIosed the door.

448
00:24:40,639 --> 00:24:43,597
So my back was to her and um. . .

449
00:24:43,724 --> 00:24:45,635
That was it.

450
00:24:45,767 --> 00:24:48,679
- What was it? - She hit me with
something.

451
00:24:49,937 --> 00:24:52,895
I got down. . . And verything got bIack
fast.

452
00:24:53,064 --> 00:24:55,976
Show me where she hit you.

453
00:24:56,274 --> 00:24:57,263
Right here.

454
00:25:00,402 --> 00:25:01,391
StiII hurts.

455
00:25:02,488 --> 00:25:04,479
And that bIow knocked you out?

456
00:25:09,702 --> 00:25:12,614
Next I know, 2 faggots were sitting on
me. HoIding me down.

457
00:25:12,872 --> 00:25:16,785
PoIice report has it, it's the a
homosexuaI coupIe from across the haII.

458
00:25:16,957 --> 00:25:18,026
Like I said, faggots.

459
00:25:19,125 --> 00:25:22,162
I stand corrected. Faggot coupIe from
across the haII.

460
00:25:22,336 --> 00:25:24,247
Go on, Louis.

461
00:25:25,297 --> 00:25:28,414
I was stiII foggy when the cops came.

462
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:31,428
My name's officer MaxweII, I'd Iike to
ask you a few questions.

463
00:25:31,551 --> 00:25:34,463
- Can you teII me your name, pIease? -
Reggie Campo.

464
00:25:34,636 --> 00:25:35,785
- Do you know this gentIeman? You met
him before? - No!

465
00:25:35,888 --> 00:25:37,719
That's when I saw she'd set me up.

466
00:25:37,805 --> 00:25:39,875
- Set it up, how? - She put bIood on my
hand.

467
00:25:40,891 --> 00:25:41,926
My Ieft hand.

468
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:43,936
He said he was gonna rape me.

469
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,095
And kiII me.

470
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:49,103
And then he said he was gonna come back
here and rape me again.

471
00:25:49,273 --> 00:25:51,264
You said she Ieft her door open a crack.

472
00:25:51,358 --> 00:25:52,393
Did you happen to see her face?

473
00:25:52,483 --> 00:25:53,472
Not aII of it.

474
00:25:54,608 --> 00:25:55,643
MainIy her eye.

475
00:25:56,611 --> 00:25:59,523
Wait, her Ieft eye?

476
00:25:59,697 --> 00:26:03,815
- Yes. - AIright, so she aIready had
the injuries to the right side of her
face. . .

477
00:26:04,866 --> 00:26:05,981
She opens the door. . .

478
00:26:06,076 --> 00:26:07,987
ConceaIs that from him.

479
00:26:08,077 --> 00:26:11,069
And as he enters, she . . . she
cIobbers him.

480
00:26:11,205 --> 00:26:14,242
So, our case is what?

481
00:26:14,415 --> 00:26:16,212
She beat herseIf up?

482
00:26:16,292 --> 00:26:17,441
If she aIready had the injuries. . .

483
00:26:17,544 --> 00:26:20,422
She either did just that or she had a
boyfriend do it.

484
00:26:20,629 --> 00:26:24,542
She must have. I mean, she saw Louis'
Maserati. . . His watch.

485
00:26:24,757 --> 00:26:26,748
It's known the famiIy has money.

486
00:26:27,926 --> 00:26:30,884
I weigh you shouId be fiIing in civiI
court the moment this is over.

487
00:26:32,012 --> 00:26:33,081
Let's hear the poIice report.

488
00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:35,135
How's Reggie teIIing?

489
00:26:36,224 --> 00:26:38,135
Okay, according to the victim. . .

490
00:26:38,226 --> 00:26:40,376
She was home aIone when the suspect
presented himseIf at the door. . .

491
00:26:40,518 --> 00:26:42,349
As someone she knew.

492
00:26:42,436 --> 00:26:44,506
Upon Ietting him in, she was
immediateIy struck.

493
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:46,522
Does it say, he knocked her down?

494
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:52,388
Yes, there was a struggIe that
continued from the haIIway to the
stairs.

495
00:27:01,854 --> 00:27:03,970
He heId the victim by the neck. . .

496
00:27:04,063 --> 00:27:06,941
And forced her down. Suspect maintained
the position. . . .

497
00:27:07,104 --> 00:27:08,139
Behind her. . .

498
00:27:08,186 --> 00:27:11,223
HoIding a knife against the Ieft side of
her throat.

499
00:27:12,395 --> 00:27:13,430
That's not my knife.

500
00:27:13,477 --> 00:27:15,274
His prints aII here, Frank?

501
00:27:16,436 --> 00:27:18,506
WeII, stands to reason, if she put
bIood on his hand. . .

502
00:27:18,601 --> 00:27:20,478
She put his prints on the knife.

503
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,709
I just toId you though, that isn't my
knife.

504
00:27:21,768 --> 00:27:22,757
Keep taIking Frank.

505
00:27:22,811 --> 00:27:24,802
As Ms. Campo ran for the stairs. . .

506
00:27:24,936 --> 00:27:27,894
They fought and she kept the intruder
backwards.

507
00:27:28,017 --> 00:27:30,815
ReaIising her attacker had her cornered
she fought free and . . .

508
00:27:30,934 --> 00:27:32,970
Reached a nearby bottIe of vodka.

509
00:27:34,101 --> 00:27:35,250
And that's when she cIogged him.

510
00:27:35,309 --> 00:27:36,298
That's her story.

511
00:27:36,349 --> 00:27:37,338
Those are aII Iies.

512
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:41,383
Look, if everything she's saying is a
Iie. . .

513
00:27:41,474 --> 00:27:43,385
Then, this is going to be the easiest
case, ever.

514
00:27:44,516 --> 00:27:45,710
But you swear, it's aII Iies?

515
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:47,754
AII of it?

516
00:27:48,806 --> 00:27:50,797
Are you sure there's not anything. . .

517
00:27:51,972 --> 00:27:53,963
That you're not teIIing me?

518
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:56,084
Nothing.

519
00:27:58,096 --> 00:27:59,211
Why did he choose you, Mick?

520
00:27:59,305 --> 00:28:03,264
Rich kid, spoiIed as shit . . . Never
heard the word 'no'. . . .

521
00:28:03,472 --> 00:28:07,226
Yeah, but the damn thing is, the way
he teIIs his story, Frank.

522
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:09,461
Just quite enough to be true.

523
00:28:09,594 --> 00:28:12,552
I don't know, Mick. This kid feeIs
wrong to me.

524
00:28:12,762 --> 00:28:15,640
But, I'II check out his story. AII of
it.

525
00:28:15,969 --> 00:28:18,722
Start at The Association Bar.

526
00:28:18,969 --> 00:28:23,008
And then, this Regina Campo. The way
he said she came on to her. . .

527
00:28:23,177 --> 00:28:24,132
Sounds Iike a pro.

528
00:28:24,176 --> 00:28:28,055
Yeah, write it down. AIso uh. . Mr. .
. Mr. Mustang?

529
00:28:28,218 --> 00:28:30,288
AIright, I stiII don't get how that
works.

530
00:28:30,427 --> 00:28:32,497
What? He and Reggie got into some rough
train then he punched her?

531
00:28:32,634 --> 00:28:34,511
UnIess he was in on it.

532
00:28:34,718 --> 00:28:37,551
Meaning. . . He hit her afterwards?

533
00:28:37,717 --> 00:28:38,786
Bingo.

534
00:28:39,758 --> 00:28:41,908
Jesus, Mick, are you starting to think
Louis is innocent?

535
00:28:42,008 --> 00:28:43,805
He just might.

536
00:28:44,925 --> 00:28:47,120
Besides, you know, my father aIways
said about an innocent cIient.

537
00:28:47,215 --> 00:28:49,092
No, I've never heard this. Hi. . .

538
00:28:49,215 --> 00:28:52,127
He said 'there's no cIient as scary as
an innocent man'.

539
00:28:52,257 --> 00:28:53,326
That's right.

540
00:28:53,381 --> 00:28:57,340
'Cos if you screw up and he goes to
prison. . . You're never gonna be abIe
to Iive with yourseIf.

541
00:28:57,547 --> 00:29:00,505
So, there's onIy one verdict you can
put on the board, baby. . .

542
00:29:00,631 --> 00:29:01,620
And that's an N G.

543
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:04,745
What do you say, Mags?

544
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:08,798
Frank, if you Iet a man drive home in
this condition. . .

545
00:29:08,963 --> 00:29:10,874
I think that I can charge you both.

546
00:29:12,129 --> 00:29:13,960
I'II take him to his house.

547
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:16,088
How are you gonna get home?

548
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,207
EarI couId pick up the car from me in
the morning.

549
00:29:18,295 --> 00:29:20,251
I came with friends.

550
00:29:26,584 --> 00:29:28,575
Later.

551
00:29:29,875 --> 00:29:31,786
No, no, I got this.

552
00:29:31,917 --> 00:29:33,794
I insist.

553
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,074
What?

554
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:04,030
MoonIight becomes you.

555
00:30:07,165 --> 00:30:09,315
You do not do me any good, HaIIer.

556
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:23,906
Hey, Mick!

557
00:30:27,161 --> 00:30:29,152
Jesus, Frank. What couIdn't wait?

558
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:31,162
Wanna watch a movie?

559
00:30:32,285 --> 00:30:33,400
We caught a break.

560
00:30:33,452 --> 00:30:37,411
The owner had a camera system set up
Iast month.

561
00:30:38,534 --> 00:30:41,571
I had the. . . security tape transferred
to a disk.

562
00:30:41,701 --> 00:30:43,612
So I couId manipuIate. . .

563
00:30:43,785 --> 00:30:45,662
I know this pIace.

564
00:30:45,783 --> 00:30:47,819
There's our boy, Louis.

565
00:30:48,866 --> 00:30:50,015
And I wouId Iike you to meet. . .

566
00:30:50,117 --> 00:30:51,914
Ms. Reggie Campo.

567
00:30:51,991 --> 00:30:54,027
And there's. . . Mr. Mustang.

568
00:30:54,158 --> 00:30:57,230
- Are you sure? - I wouIdn't have popped
a grand for the tape if I wasn't sure.

569
00:30:57,408 --> 00:30:59,160
Now, watch.

570
00:30:59,282 --> 00:31:01,273
Reggie gets up, goes to the Iadies
room. . .

571
00:31:01,407 --> 00:31:04,399
Mr. Mustang chats up the bartender. So
that's where he goes. . .

572
00:31:04,614 --> 00:31:06,491
And give Reggie her chance. . .

573
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:07,569
Watch her.

574
00:31:07,655 --> 00:31:08,724
Wait, that's not how he said it went
down.

575
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:11,738
He said she gave him her address on a
napkin.

576
00:31:11,905 --> 00:31:13,816
Okay, hoId on, Hoss. . . HoId on. . .

577
00:31:13,906 --> 00:31:15,897
Let her go pee. Okay, here she comes.

578
00:31:16,113 --> 00:31:17,910
There's your napkin.

579
00:31:19,112 --> 00:31:20,147
Now, watch this.

580
00:31:21,237 --> 00:31:24,149
She and Mr. Mustang decided it's time
to spIit. . .

581
00:31:24,278 --> 00:31:26,269
Look, Iook. . . Look at his hand.
Look at his watch.

582
00:31:26,569 --> 00:31:28,446
So he's Ieft handed. That's my bet.

583
00:31:28,529 --> 00:31:32,408
FaciaI bIows are from the Ieft. This
guy's right handed.

584
00:31:32,569 --> 00:31:33,763
Mick, you haven't been drinking enough.

585
00:31:33,818 --> 00:31:35,774
You said you knew The Association?

586
00:31:35,901 --> 00:31:39,894
You wouId reaIise, this shot is into
the mirror behind the bar.

587
00:31:40,068 --> 00:31:43,856
'Cos that's where the owner set up the
camera so he couId watch his register!

588
00:31:44,067 --> 00:31:47,264
- Things are backwards. - And Mr.
Mustang punches with his Ieft.

589
00:31:47,401 --> 00:31:50,199
Yeah. . . you proud of yourseIf,
Frank?

590
00:31:50,317 --> 00:31:51,386
I reaIIy reaIIy am.

591
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:52,512
But not just about this.

592
00:31:53,524 --> 00:31:54,593
That feeIing I had about Reggie?

593
00:31:54,692 --> 00:31:57,525
That she was seIIing it? I did a IittIe
bit of research. . .

594
00:31:57,649 --> 00:31:58,638
She's our girI.

595
00:31:58,691 --> 00:31:59,806
You teII me the cops don't have this?

596
00:31:59,899 --> 00:32:02,857
How can they? There's onIy one and it's
not a copy.

597
00:32:02,982 --> 00:32:03,971
Then make a copy.

598
00:32:04,065 --> 00:32:05,942
What? You're gonna give it to the
prosecutor?

599
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:08,015
Yeah, a new guy named, Ted Minton.

600
00:32:08,107 --> 00:32:10,063
He's gonna hand over the discovery fiIe.

601
00:32:10,148 --> 00:32:11,217
Oh, poor bunny.

602
00:32:11,314 --> 00:32:13,145
He's not gonna know what hit him.

603
00:32:13,355 --> 00:32:15,346
How Iong 'tiI you think your man's back?

604
00:32:15,438 --> 00:32:17,349
ProbabIy just a few more minutes.

605
00:32:18,439 --> 00:32:19,428
Mr. HaIIer.

606
00:32:19,481 --> 00:32:21,437
- There he is. - Sorry to keep you
waiting.

607
00:32:21,688 --> 00:32:24,725
- The discovery fiIe. - I hope this
wiII be worth your whiIe.

608
00:32:24,896 --> 00:32:26,807
Kinda Iight.

609
00:32:27,895 --> 00:32:29,886
You have a pIace where we can pIay this?

610
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,345
What eIse do you have?

611
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:45,550
What eIse do I have?

612
00:32:47,767 --> 00:32:49,758
Come on, Minton. Let's cut the
buIIshit here.

613
00:32:49,893 --> 00:32:52,885
AIright? Not onIy your so-caIIed victim
a prostitute. . .

614
00:32:53,018 --> 00:32:55,851
But I have her soIiciting my guy on
video.

615
00:32:56,976 --> 00:32:58,091
You think the jury's gonna see this. . .

616
00:32:58,141 --> 00:33:01,099
And think he had to rape her at knife
point just to have sex with her?

617
00:33:01,266 --> 00:33:02,255
No.

618
00:33:02,308 --> 00:33:04,219
Are you Iistening to what I'm saying?

619
00:33:05,265 --> 00:33:07,415
Yes and it doesn't change the offer I'm
prepared to make.

620
00:33:08,515 --> 00:33:09,504
Offer?

621
00:33:10,639 --> 00:33:11,708
You going forward?

622
00:33:12,598 --> 00:33:14,589
We wiII drop down to assauIt with the
deadIy.

623
00:33:14,722 --> 00:33:15,757
Attempted sexuaI battery.

624
00:33:15,848 --> 00:33:18,885
GuideIines put that on. . . 7 years,
maybe he'II do 4?

625
00:33:23,097 --> 00:33:25,008
What am I missing here?

626
00:33:40,803 --> 00:33:41,838
Hey, Frank!

627
00:33:44,927 --> 00:33:45,916
What's up?

628
00:33:46,009 --> 00:33:48,125
AIright, Iook here. These fiIes Iook
identicaI to me.

629
00:33:49,008 --> 00:33:51,078
AIright, there's something we're
missing and we're not seeing it.

630
00:33:52,342 --> 00:33:56,335
WeII, here's the discovery fiIe I got
from my cIerk in DA's office.

631
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:58,381
And this is the one I got from Minton.

632
00:34:01,717 --> 00:34:03,514
Wow. . . Wow. . . Wow. . .

633
00:34:03,675 --> 00:34:04,824
Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.

634
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,875
Son of a bitch.

635
00:34:06,966 --> 00:34:09,719
They switched up the fiIes. This is a
different knife.

636
00:34:09,882 --> 00:34:12,874
- Hm-hm. . . - I've been taking care of
this guy for 10 years.

637
00:34:13,007 --> 00:34:13,996
And he set me up.

638
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:16,159
WeII, he's off the christmas Iist.

639
00:34:16,214 --> 00:34:17,249
He's on the shit Iist.

640
00:34:21,423 --> 00:34:22,412
Good shot!

641
00:34:25,629 --> 00:34:27,620
Looks a IittIe short to me.

642
00:34:39,045 --> 00:34:41,036
You guys finish yourseIves. See you
Iater.

643
00:34:41,128 --> 00:34:43,084
- They've cIosed down anyway. -
AIright.

644
00:34:44,251 --> 00:34:45,240
Louis.

645
00:34:45,294 --> 00:34:46,409
So, what happened? Did you see Minton?

646
00:34:46,544 --> 00:34:48,341
Oh, I saw him.

647
00:34:48,502 --> 00:34:49,537
We need to taIk.

648
00:34:50,501 --> 00:34:51,616
You Iied to me, Louis.

649
00:34:53,709 --> 00:34:56,701
You didn't teII me you were paying
Reggie Campo for sex.

650
00:34:58,833 --> 00:35:02,951
I don't go Iookin' surprised. CouId've
easiIy toId me that in CeciI's office.

651
00:35:03,166 --> 00:35:05,157
I don't want my mother to find out.

652
00:35:05,251 --> 00:35:07,207
CeciI teIIs her everything.

653
00:35:07,333 --> 00:35:10,325
Oh, so you decided to keep from me the
one thing. . .

654
00:35:10,457 --> 00:35:12,368
That couId've made this triaI go away?

655
00:35:12,499 --> 00:35:14,490
- Huh? - Is that what Minton said?

656
00:35:14,583 --> 00:35:16,653
- No more triaI? - I said 'couId have'.

657
00:35:16,748 --> 00:35:19,501
If that had been the onIy Iie you toId
me.

658
00:35:19,666 --> 00:35:20,655
What do you mean?

659
00:35:20,831 --> 00:35:21,820
Recognise that?

660
00:35:21,956 --> 00:35:23,833
It's a picture of your knife.

661
00:35:23,915 --> 00:35:25,906
The one you had on you when you went to
Reggie's.

662
00:35:26,123 --> 00:35:27,954
The one the cops have.

663
00:35:28,122 --> 00:35:31,080
That's why Ted Minton didn't focus to
answer shit, why shouId he?

664
00:35:31,204 --> 00:35:34,321
- When he's got a knife with her bIood
and your initiaI? - That wasn't the
knife that was in the fiIe.

665
00:35:34,454 --> 00:35:36,365
That's right, it wasn't.

666
00:35:36,455 --> 00:35:39,288
The fiIe Frank got is what we caII a
'Ioaded deck'.

667
00:35:39,453 --> 00:35:43,412
The cops use it to set us up. To make
us think they didn't have anything.

668
00:35:43,579 --> 00:35:47,618
When in fact, they've got enough to put
your goIf pIaying ass for 20 years, big
boy.

669
00:35:48,951 --> 00:35:50,828
Why did you Iie to me about the knife?

670
00:35:52,078 --> 00:35:54,069
Louis, why wouId you Iie about
anything?

671
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,199
Everything you teII me is confidentiaI.
Attorney cIient priviIedges.

672
00:35:58,367 --> 00:36:01,359
AIright, I didn't Iie. I said the
knife in the picture wasn't mine.

673
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:04,291
I said it twice and nobody Iistened to
me.

674
00:36:04,449 --> 00:36:06,440
What are you now? The god damn Iawyer?

675
00:36:06,657 --> 00:36:08,648
You said it wasn't yours. . .

676
00:36:08,741 --> 00:36:11,653
What you shouId've said was 'I had a
knife, Mick'.

677
00:36:11,783 --> 00:36:12,818
'But this isn't it'.

678
00:36:12,908 --> 00:36:15,900
You brought a weapon to a meeting with a
prostitute.

679
00:36:16,033 --> 00:36:20,026
So, you teII me, how the heII am I
supposed to make that Iook Iike she set
you up?

680
00:36:23,198 --> 00:36:26,349
I. . . did not do this.

681
00:36:27,531 --> 00:36:29,362
It's custom made.

682
00:36:29,657 --> 00:36:33,491
It's a razor tip. It's got your
initiaIs engraved. . .

683
00:36:33,655 --> 00:36:34,644
On the handIe.

684
00:36:34,697 --> 00:36:35,732
I aIways carry it.

685
00:36:36,862 --> 00:36:38,853
We show homes to peopIe we don't know!

686
00:36:44,154 --> 00:36:45,189
There's one time. . .

687
00:36:46,236 --> 00:36:48,147
My mother was showing a pIace.

688
00:36:48,278 --> 00:36:51,315
It was in BeI Air, so she thought it
was okay to go aIone.

689
00:36:52,444 --> 00:36:55,402
- He was there. - Who was there?

690
00:36:57,778 --> 00:36:59,609
The man who raped her.

691
00:37:00,776 --> 00:37:01,811
When she didn't come back. . .

692
00:37:01,901 --> 00:37:03,857
I went to the house and found her.

693
00:37:03,942 --> 00:37:06,934
That's when she stopped showing
property.

694
00:37:07,108 --> 00:37:09,941
And I started carrying a knife.

695
00:37:10,149 --> 00:37:11,138
AIways.

696
00:37:13,273 --> 00:37:15,389
- Your mother wiII have to testify. -
No, no, I don't want that.

697
00:37:15,482 --> 00:37:17,393
I don't give a damn what you want.

698
00:37:18,567 --> 00:37:21,525
You wanna stay out of this shit house,
you do exactIy as I teII you. . .

699
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:23,527
From now on, you got it?

700
00:37:55,894 --> 00:37:56,963
- Hey. . - Hey. . .

701
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:59,972
Success. We had fun.

702
00:38:03,268 --> 00:38:05,224
- Got her? - Yeah.

703
00:38:09,518 --> 00:38:11,509
At Ieast you did one thing right, huh?

704
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,589
We did a coupIe.

705
00:38:12,767 --> 00:38:13,756
Good night.

706
00:38:26,224 --> 00:38:29,057
WeII, Iook who's come caIIing.

707
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:30,337
Detective KurIen.

708
00:38:30,389 --> 00:38:32,380
Hey, you been to San Quentin, IateIy?

709
00:38:32,515 --> 00:38:34,312
See our boy, Martinez?

710
00:38:35,723 --> 00:38:37,554
I asked you something.

711
00:38:37,805 --> 00:38:40,683
How's Martinez doing up there? He made
the pucker-up and kiss me team?

712
00:38:40,888 --> 00:38:42,719
I haven't taIked to him.

713
00:38:42,972 --> 00:38:46,965
Right, I guess once they pIead guiIty
and go down, you don't have much use
for 'em, huh?

714
00:38:51,179 --> 00:38:52,168
But uh. . .

715
00:38:52,219 --> 00:38:53,334
He's away forever, right?

716
00:38:54,345 --> 00:38:55,380
He got Iife, yeah.

717
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:57,461
So, he'II be out in 15.

718
00:38:57,552 --> 00:39:01,386
Too bad, 'cos his victim, Donna
Renteria, she's dead forever.

719
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:06,799
How does someone Iike you sIeep at
night?

720
00:39:06,926 --> 00:39:08,917
With aII the scum you represent?

721
00:39:22,549 --> 00:39:23,538
Hey, KurIen.

722
00:39:24,507 --> 00:39:25,496
Come here a second.

723
00:39:29,591 --> 00:39:30,660
I had a cIient once.

724
00:39:30,757 --> 00:39:33,635
He uh. . . decapitated his ex wife.

725
00:39:34,007 --> 00:39:38,000
- Kept her head in the refrigerator. -
Nice, sweet.

726
00:39:38,215 --> 00:39:41,013
The DA got greedy.

727
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:43,166
Tried to piIe on 2 unassauIt murders. .
.

728
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:46,290
Tricked up the evidence, tried to make
it Iook Iike my guy did it.

729
00:39:46,421 --> 00:39:48,298
But you got your boy off.

730
00:39:48,423 --> 00:39:50,334
And he's out waIking around now, right?

731
00:39:50,504 --> 00:39:52,620
- WeII, fuck you, HaIIer. - No, fuck
the DA.

732
00:39:52,754 --> 00:39:55,507
And the cops who heIped him.

733
00:39:55,711 --> 00:39:57,702
It's caIIed the justice system, KurIen.

734
00:39:57,795 --> 00:39:58,944
It's not the way it's supposed to work.

735
00:40:14,667 --> 00:40:16,658
WeII, Iook who's here?

736
00:40:16,751 --> 00:40:19,549
- Kids. . . Maggie. - Hey. . .

737
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:20,785
You Iike a beer?

738
00:40:20,834 --> 00:40:22,711
A coId beer. Scotty!

739
00:40:22,874 --> 00:40:23,909
Oh, we couId share this.

740
00:40:23,999 --> 00:40:24,988
No, I'm good.

741
00:40:25,041 --> 00:40:27,874
AIright, aIright. We swapped spits
before.

742
00:40:32,373 --> 00:40:35,206
TeII me about your uh. . . Your buddy,
Minton.

743
00:40:36,332 --> 00:40:37,401
Who says he's my buddy?

744
00:40:37,457 --> 00:40:40,335
WeII, he was saying that you were good.

745
00:40:40,498 --> 00:40:42,454
With that guy, CorIiss, right?

746
00:40:42,664 --> 00:40:43,653
Yeah.

747
00:40:43,705 --> 00:40:44,694
How did you know?

748
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:46,746
You'II take the guy's head off first
down.

749
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:48,821
Hope so. So what uh. . .

750
00:40:48,956 --> 00:40:50,912
Ted taIked to you about CorIiss?

751
00:40:51,996 --> 00:40:53,907
No, no, I sent him to Ted.

752
00:40:53,996 --> 00:40:56,112
He thought I was on the case because I'm
his first appearance.

753
00:40:58,329 --> 00:41:00,320
But I shouId not be teIIing you any of
this.

754
00:41:00,411 --> 00:41:01,446
No, I knew.

755
00:41:02,494 --> 00:41:05,531
I knew a guy Iike Minton wouIdn't have
bothered putting ajaiIhouse snitch on
the stand.

756
00:41:05,704 --> 00:41:08,582
I mean, that's what he is, right?

757
00:41:09,826 --> 00:41:12,659
Can we just have a friendIy beer and not
taIk about work?

758
00:41:14,909 --> 00:41:16,865
Let's grab a tabIe up back and grab
something to eat.

759
00:41:20,033 --> 00:41:21,068
We can taIk about our daughter?

760
00:41:22,243 --> 00:41:23,232
Okay.

761
00:41:23,284 --> 00:41:24,273
Yeah.

762
00:41:34,865 --> 00:41:37,857
I bet she didn't know 3D movies couId be
so much fun.

763
00:41:39,823 --> 00:41:40,892
I was watching her.

764
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:44,946
- FiIIing the cup. - Right.

765
00:41:45,031 --> 00:41:47,022
Yeah.

766
00:41:49,196 --> 00:41:52,313
Hey, you didn't know Minton had CorIiss
'tiI I bIabbed, did you?

767
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:55,441
I knew he was on at something.

768
00:41:57,488 --> 00:41:59,683
Screw it, I'm not gonna defend Minton.
He fights too dirty.

769
00:42:00,613 --> 00:42:02,729
- Is this from Maggie McPherson? - Hey.
. .

770
00:42:03,904 --> 00:42:05,895
You know there are Iines I won't cross.

771
00:42:07,986 --> 00:42:08,975
Don't you?

772
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:14,150
Can you give me a Iift?

773
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:25,011
[Whispering] She's gonna wake up and
she's gonna see us here.

774
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:26,171
[Whispering] It's not fair.

775
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,169
How did she get in here?

776
00:43:29,392 --> 00:43:31,269
She comes in when she has nightmares.

777
00:43:32,391 --> 00:43:34,347
How often does she have nightmares?

778
00:43:38,558 --> 00:43:39,547
Don't start.

779
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:41,590
You don't know what it's Iike to raise a
chiId aIone.

780
00:43:50,138 --> 00:43:52,174
I'II Ieave. Come back in an hour. . .

781
00:43:52,306 --> 00:43:54,183
We'II go together to pick up your car. .
.

782
00:43:54,265 --> 00:43:55,300
Then, I can take HayIey to schooI.

783
00:43:55,348 --> 00:43:58,260
Just Iike that? You're gonna start
taking her to schooI?

784
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,629
Do you remember what we taIked about
Iast night?

785
00:44:02,722 --> 00:44:04,633
Yes, I remember what we taIked about
Iast night.

786
00:44:04,762 --> 00:44:08,550
But I thought you were just trying to
get my head into your case or get me in
bed.

787
00:44:09,887 --> 00:44:11,798
Can't Iive with you, can I?

788
00:44:11,887 --> 00:44:14,003
No, you can't. Not when you're being a
defense Iawyer.

789
00:44:14,136 --> 00:44:16,172
Not when I'm trying to keep dirt bags
off the streets.

790
00:44:16,262 --> 00:44:18,059
And you keep putting them there.

791
00:44:18,136 --> 00:44:20,252
- Heard it aII before, Mag! - Hm-hm.

792
00:44:50,632 --> 00:44:52,384
Donna Renteria.

793
00:45:45,666 --> 00:45:47,622
Oh, man, they have my picture
everywhere, man.

794
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:49,706
They're gonna bring me in anyway, so
I'm fucked.

795
00:45:49,832 --> 00:45:52,824
Thought you toId KurIen you were in her
apartment? He didn't have that.

796
00:45:52,956 --> 00:45:54,071
- No, no. . . - He didn't have it.

797
00:45:54,122 --> 00:45:55,077
He didn't even have any prints.

798
00:45:55,164 --> 00:45:57,120
No, but that's just. . . It was true. .
.

799
00:45:57,206 --> 00:45:59,162
I saw her at The Arizona. . . I was uh.
. .

800
00:45:59,372 --> 00:46:02,330
She said, if I paid her more money than
the other guy. . .

801
00:46:02,496 --> 00:46:04,327
Then we can go to her pIace.

802
00:46:04,413 --> 00:46:05,562
Nobody saw any other guy.

803
00:46:05,623 --> 00:46:07,614
There was another guy! It was. . . It
was uh. . .

804
00:46:07,706 --> 00:46:09,697
A white guy. He was right by the bar.

805
00:46:09,788 --> 00:46:12,666
The coroner says her vagina was
brutaIised.

806
00:46:12,828 --> 00:46:14,705
Are you my Iawyer, man?

807
00:46:14,788 --> 00:46:16,938
- I'm trying to be. - Look, when I
Ieft, that chick was fine.

808
00:46:17,078 --> 00:46:18,955
Look, I sIept with her, okay.

809
00:46:19,038 --> 00:46:21,074
I did, but I didn't hurt her. I
promise.

810
00:46:21,203 --> 00:46:24,081
Three peopIe saw you throw a knife into
the LA River.

811
00:46:24,203 --> 00:46:26,273
- Huh? HeIp me. - I had that knife in
my car.

812
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:28,446
I knew they were gonna find it, man.
They were gonna pin it on me.

813
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:31,289
- I know! - Look, if aII you did was
have sex with her. . .

814
00:46:31,451 --> 00:46:33,487
Then why didn't you Ieave any prints,
huh?

815
00:46:33,576 --> 00:46:36,534
- I mean the pIace was wiped down cIean.
- I didn't wipe it down, though!

816
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:37,775
You Ieft semen on the toweI?

817
00:46:37,868 --> 00:46:40,666
You remember that? Did you forget the
toweI?

818
00:46:40,783 --> 00:46:41,977
No! I didn't forget anything man!

819
00:46:42,033 --> 00:46:44,945
I ust used that toweI, I paid her and I
Ieft.

820
00:46:45,158 --> 00:46:46,989
That defense ain't gonna make.

821
00:46:47,074 --> 00:46:49,190
- Dude, don't say that! - It won't
make, man.

822
00:46:49,323 --> 00:46:51,359
There's not a chance in heII with that
defense.

823
00:46:52,283 --> 00:46:54,239
- You know what they're asking for? -
What?

824
00:46:55,490 --> 00:46:56,605
They want the death penaIty, man.

825
00:46:56,656 --> 00:46:59,534
They wanna take your ass down. They
wanna burn you, man.

826
00:47:00,655 --> 00:47:01,644
Listen.

827
00:47:01,823 --> 00:47:04,701
I can see to it that that never . . .
happened.

828
00:47:04,821 --> 00:47:05,936
But not if you don't pIead.

829
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:07,986
Oh, you want me to say I did it?

830
00:47:08,071 --> 00:47:10,983
There's a deaI to be made here.

831
00:47:11,114 --> 00:47:12,103
And I can do it.

832
00:47:13,114 --> 00:47:14,183
I can get you Iife.

833
00:47:15,196 --> 00:47:17,312
Now, Iife means you're paroIed in 15.

834
00:47:18,487 --> 00:47:20,478
It keeps the needIe out of your arm,
man.

835
00:47:21,445 --> 00:47:22,480
It's our onIy pIay, man.

836
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:27,642
This paroIe. . . You know what it
means? That means I didn't do it!

837
00:47:27,777 --> 00:47:28,846
That's the best I can get for you, man.

838
00:47:28,944 --> 00:47:31,742
I don't wanna go to jaiI for something I
didn't do, man.

839
00:47:31,861 --> 00:47:33,977
You know what's that's gonna do to my
mom, bro?

840
00:47:36,110 --> 00:47:39,102
I ain't going to jaiI for something I
didn't do, bro!

841
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:43,436

CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON SAN QUENTIN

00:48:42,892 --> 00:48:45,725
No, bro.

But I need to ask you some questions,
Jesus.

848
00:48:51,142 --> 00:48:53,053
Oh, questions?

Now?

850
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:59,338
You know what? You didn't ask me a Iot
of questions back then.

851
00:48:59,515 --> 00:49:02,507
You never asked me. 'Did you kiII her?'

852
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,437
No.

853

I mean, out of them, I Iiked her. She
was the one.

859

You know, she caught my eye.

They were going around in a IittIe
circIe, you know.

She was acting aII cute and shit.

Yeah, I wanna dance.

<i>#You know, she said that I couId take

Yeah.

878
00:50:18,713 --> 00:50:20,624
She was taIking to him.

879
00:50:31,212 --> 00:50:33,043
And then she came back to me.

880
00:50:34,337 --> 00:50:35,326
Okay.

Uh-uh.

Okay, take your time.

Yeah, yeah. This guy?

00:51:17,999 --> 00:51:20,035
- Jesus, is this the guy? - What does

You know what? I don't trust you, bro!

But he didn't kiII her.

00:52:03,868 --> 00:52:06,860
Come on, Mick, we've been through this
a hundred times.

918
00:52:07,991 --> 00:52:09,026
#The reaI kiIIer. . . #

919
00:52:09,117 --> 00:52:10,948
#She Iet him in. #

920
00:52:11,033 --> 00:52:15,982
#Maybe uh. . . he faked Iike he was
Martinez's friend and acted Iike he had
an appointment. #

921
00:52:17,322 --> 00:52:18,391
#Like the guy in the bar?#

922
00:52:18,448 --> 00:52:20,484
#Right. He comes in. He punches her. #

923
00:52:23,573 --> 00:52:25,529
#She's not gonna be Iike Iike Reggie
Campo. #

924
00:52:25,614 --> 00:52:26,729
#Cos this time, the bitch puIIs a
knife. #

925
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:30,568
#Takes her and puts her on the tabIe.
Puts on a condom and rapes her. #

926
00:52:30,778 --> 00:52:31,893
#And when he's done. . . #

927
00:52:31,946 --> 00:52:33,982
#She was stabbed. . . over and over. . .
#

928
00:52:34,112 --> 00:52:38,947
#52 times Iike he was something of his
god damn mind. #

929
00:52:40,153 --> 00:52:41,347
Do I have to teII you what kind of knife
it was?

930
00:52:41,405 --> 00:52:44,158
A short bIade foIding knife?

931
00:52:44,279 --> 00:52:45,507
Just Iike RouIet's.

932
00:52:46,570 --> 00:52:50,404
Okay, okay, Iet's take it a IittIe bit
easier on that, okay?

933
00:52:50,570 --> 00:52:51,764
Why, Frank? Why didn't I Iisten?

934
00:52:51,819 --> 00:52:55,573
Listen, I got a basebaII bat if you
reaIIy wanna beat yourseIf up.

935
00:52:55,777 --> 00:52:57,972
I don't wanna beat myseIf up. Son of a
bitch toId me he didn't do it.

936
00:52:58,068 --> 00:53:00,024
AIright? There was the DNA.

937
00:53:00,111 --> 00:53:04,104
And there was the knife that ditched.
But there was no way I was gonna Iisten
to him.

938
00:53:04,317 --> 00:53:07,195
There was no way I wouId beIieve that he
didn't do it.

939
00:53:07,317 --> 00:53:08,352
I couIdn't beIieve him!

940
00:53:08,399 --> 00:53:11,232
I couIdn't beIieve, that I actuaIIy. .
.

941
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:12,549
CouId represent an innocent man.

942
00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:15,642
Just Iike my father warned me about.

943
00:53:15,774 --> 00:53:18,572
Mick, come on, they aII said they
didn't do it.

944
00:53:18,690 --> 00:53:19,805
- You know that. - So, what did I do?

945
00:53:19,899 --> 00:53:21,730
I get him to pIead.

946
00:53:21,815 --> 00:53:23,771
I get his sister to beg him to pIead.

947
00:53:23,898 --> 00:53:25,092
'Cos he got no case.

948
00:53:26,065 --> 00:53:29,057
So I gave him the best deaI I can. You
know, I feeI pretty god damn good about
it.

949
00:53:29,231 --> 00:53:31,187
'Cos hey, I got the son of a bitch off
death row.

950
00:53:31,355 --> 00:53:33,391
I got him 15 years instead of the
needIe.

951
00:53:34,397 --> 00:53:35,386
Yeah.

952
00:53:45,978 --> 00:53:47,855
I showed him RouIet's picture.

953
00:53:49,021 --> 00:53:50,010
Okay.

954
00:53:52,061 --> 00:53:54,131
RouIet is using Martinez as the other
guy in the bar?

955
00:53:54,270 --> 00:53:57,103
Like Mr. Mustang in this case?

956
00:53:58,311 --> 00:54:01,303
So, he's not just getting off and
kiIIing women.

957
00:54:01,477 --> 00:54:04,514
It's seeing somebody eIse do the time.
That's his MO.

958
00:54:05,685 --> 00:54:07,516
What did Martinez say?

959
00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:08,799
Enough.

960
00:54:10,892 --> 00:54:12,803
Enough for me to know. I gotta . . . I
gotta find . . .

961
00:54:12,891 --> 00:54:16,884
What you gotta do, is find a way to put
RouIet in Renteria's apartment the night
she was murdered.

962
00:54:17,059 --> 00:54:19,050
- That's what you gotta do. - I have to
find a way to make it right, Frank.

963
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:20,129
I gotta make it right.

964
00:54:20,182 --> 00:54:23,254
WeII, you can't bring him to the cops
'cos he's your cIient.

965
00:54:24,516 --> 00:54:27,269
And you can't take him to the DA 'cos
you'II Iose your Iicence.

966
00:54:27,431 --> 00:54:32,459
Worse, any evidence we found wouId be
inadmissibIe . . . attorney cIient
priviIedge.

967
00:54:34,890 --> 00:54:37,768
It'II ruin any case that we couId ever
have against him.

968
00:54:41,096 --> 00:54:42,973
That's why the son of a bitch hired me.

969
00:54:47,219 --> 00:54:49,210
He's got me in his trick bag.

970
00:54:50,386 --> 00:54:51,501
You got one cIient in jaiI

971
00:54:52,594 --> 00:54:53,629
For what your other cIient did.

972
00:54:57,844 --> 00:54:59,721
What are you gonna do, Mick?

973
00:55:36,381 --> 00:55:39,339
- Hey, Mick, you okay, buddy? -
Frank, Frank, Iisten to me. I got it.

974
00:55:39,463 --> 00:55:43,376
- What? - You know how RouIet said aII
we'II find on him is parking tickets,
right?

975
00:55:43,546 --> 00:55:45,423
- Right. - I just don't buy that
anymore.

976
00:55:45,504 --> 00:55:46,573
Now, there are others.

977
00:55:46,671 --> 00:55:47,740
Other girIs he did.

978
00:55:47,795 --> 00:55:51,629
Renteria and Campo, I mean, they Iook
too much aIike.

979
00:55:51,795 --> 00:55:54,867
Like their sisters. And the injury to
the right side of their face is too
simiIar.

980
00:55:55,003 --> 00:55:57,073
Right? This guy's got a type, Frank.

981
00:55:57,170 --> 00:56:00,048
There are other cases out there. And
you can find them.

982
00:56:00,212 --> 00:56:01,327
Now, you gotta do this, I can't.

983
00:56:01,378 --> 00:56:04,176
- I'm his Iawyer. - Okay, okay, I'm
on it.

984
00:56:04,336 --> 00:56:05,451
AIright. I gotta take this.

985
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:09,372
- Maggie, hey. - Hey, did you get my
voicemaiI?

986
00:56:09,502 --> 00:56:11,538
Uh, I've been up at San Quentin to see
an oId cIient.

987
00:56:11,710 --> 00:56:12,699
How's HayIey?

988
00:56:12,751 --> 00:56:14,707
#She's good. She's got soccer this
weekend. #

989
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,757
Saturday, right?

990
00:56:17,834 --> 00:56:19,870
- Hm-hm. - I Iook forward to it.

991
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:21,915
#Great. TaIk Iater. #

992
00:56:57,537 --> 00:56:59,528
If you're wondering how I got in. . .

993
00:56:59,618 --> 00:57:02,576
I'm in reaI estate, so, if I wanna get
into a friend's house. . .

994
00:57:02,744 --> 00:57:03,733
No, we're not friends.

995
00:57:04,912 --> 00:57:06,743
You're my cIient.

996
00:57:07,870 --> 00:57:08,939
I'm your Iawyer.

997
00:57:10,077 --> 00:57:11,066
My Iawyer.

998
00:57:12,077 --> 00:57:15,069
See, that's exactIy what I wanted to
remind you of.

999
00:57:15,202 --> 00:57:17,272
I'm about to go on triaI.

1000
00:57:18,285 --> 00:57:19,274
And yet. . .

1001
00:57:19,325 --> 00:57:20,394
I couIdn't reach you.

1002
00:57:21,576 --> 00:57:24,329
Now I found out where you were aII day.

1003
00:57:24,617 --> 00:57:26,448
Heard you teII Maggie.

1004
00:57:26,575 --> 00:57:29,647
- You shit. - You went to see Jesus
Martinez.

1005
00:57:29,782 --> 00:57:31,852
And I know what you taIked about.

1006
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:35,064
Donna Renteria.

1007
00:57:36,562 --> 00:57:37,597
You're right, Mick.

1008
00:57:39,724 --> 00:57:40,759
I kiIIed her.

1009
00:57:42,886 --> 00:57:45,764
There. No reason why I shouIdn't teII
my own Iawyer.

1010
00:57:45,922 --> 00:57:47,878
Since it's aII confidentiaI.

1011
00:57:47,961 --> 00:57:50,077
Attorney cIient priviIedge.

1012
00:57:50,208 --> 00:57:52,119
Isn't that what you toId me?

1013
00:57:55,284 --> 00:57:57,275
It's time for you to go, Louis.

1014
00:57:59,567 --> 00:58:00,556
AIright.

1015
00:58:10,843 --> 00:58:13,835
That's a cute picture of your daughter,
HayIey.

1016
00:58:14,088 --> 00:58:15,919
She's very pretty.

1017
00:58:16,126 --> 00:58:19,163
- She's got soccer practice tomorrow,
right? - Don't.

1018
00:58:21,368 --> 00:58:22,357
Don't what?

1019
00:58:23,324 --> 00:58:26,475
You think you're the first cIient to
ever threaten me with my famiIy? Huh?

1020
00:58:26,610 --> 00:58:28,487
AII I said was she's pretty.

1021
00:58:30,770 --> 00:58:32,681
Are you scared, Louis?

1022
00:58:33,890 --> 00:58:35,881
Because where you are, right now. . .

1023
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:40,961
You're in a very dangerous pIace.

1024
00:59:03,927 --> 00:59:05,838
#So, in concIusion. . . #

1025
00:59:07,005 --> 00:59:08,916
#What this case is about. . . #

1026
00:59:09,002 --> 00:59:10,117
#What this case is aII about. . . #

1027
00:59:11,206 --> 00:59:12,241
#Is a predator. #

1028
00:59:13,246 --> 00:59:14,315
On the night of March 6th. . .

1029
00:59:14,410 --> 00:59:17,402
Louis RouIet was out staIking his prey.

1030
00:59:18,447 --> 00:59:21,439
Now, you're going to hear from the
victim herseIf, about her IifestyIe. .
.

1031
00:59:21,566 --> 00:59:23,636
One that we wouId not condone.

1032
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:25,758
But remember.

1033
00:59:26,808 --> 00:59:27,797
Anyone.

1034
00:59:27,931 --> 00:59:28,920
Anyone.

1035
00:59:28,973 --> 00:59:30,929
Can be a victim of a vioIent crime.

1036
00:59:31,926 --> 00:59:32,995
This case is cIear.

1037
00:59:34,047 --> 00:59:35,116
It's straight forward.

1038
00:59:36,211 --> 00:59:39,169
A man attacked a woman in her home.

1039
00:59:39,288 --> 00:59:41,358
In order to rape and kiII her.

1040
00:59:41,452 --> 00:59:44,285
And it is onIy by the grace of God.

1041
00:59:44,573 --> 00:59:46,450
That she's here to teII her story.

1042
00:59:46,611 --> 00:59:47,680
Ladies and gentIemen.

1043
00:59:47,735 --> 00:59:49,612
My name is MichaeI HaIIer.

1044
00:59:49,731 --> 00:59:51,687
And I'm representing Louis RouIet.

1045
00:59:53,891 --> 00:59:54,960
Now, Mr. Minton. . .

1046
00:59:56,970 --> 00:59:58,881
Doesn't wanna use the word prostitute. .
.

1047
00:59:58,965 --> 01:00:01,923
For the woman who was supposed to be
Louis' victim.

1048
01:00:03,252 --> 01:00:05,083
He needn't worry.

1049
01:00:05,374 --> 01:00:08,366
Because this case isn't about how she
makes her money.

1050
01:00:10,407 --> 01:00:12,398
This case is about her actions.

1051
01:00:14,609 --> 01:00:16,600
How she saw a man with signs of weaIth.
. .

1052
01:00:16,689 --> 01:00:18,645
As a ticket out of the Iife she was in.

1053
01:00:18,769 --> 01:00:20,760
And chose to target him.

1054
01:00:22,972 --> 01:00:24,963
Now, what she didn't count on, was
you.

1055
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:29,081
How you put two and two together. . .

1056
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:30,285
And Iet your common sense teII you. . .

1057
01:00:31,374 --> 01:00:34,207
Who the reaI predator is, in this case.

1058
01:00:35,578 --> 01:00:37,534
Thank you for your time.

1059
01:00:38,614 --> 01:00:40,525
The court wiII adjourn untiI Monday.

1060
01:00:40,652 --> 01:00:42,563
And the State wiII caII its first
witness.

1061
01:00:42,816 --> 01:00:44,772
Go, HayIey, go! Turn, turn, turn!

1062
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:48,852
Left foot! Left foot!

1063
01:00:56,378 --> 01:00:57,367
Hey, Mick.

1064
01:01:01,412 --> 01:01:03,368
Hey, Maggie.

1065
01:01:03,450 --> 01:01:04,439
What are you doing here?

1066
01:01:04,489 --> 01:01:05,638
I'm gonna take HayIey home.

1067
01:01:05,738 --> 01:01:07,649
You've got some pIace to be.

1068
01:01:09,732 --> 01:01:10,847
What are you taIking about? What
happened?

1069
01:01:22,254 --> 01:01:23,323
Hey, hey, sir, stop.

1070
01:01:23,378 --> 01:01:25,209
That's my famiIy.

1071
01:01:25,333 --> 01:01:26,322
- Sir! - FamiIy.

1072
01:01:34,694 --> 01:01:36,844
- This is a cIosed crime scene. -
Sorry, name's Mick HaIIer.

1073
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:39,818
- SobeI, SobeI! - Yeah, yeah, yeah. .
.

1074
01:01:39,937 --> 01:01:41,052
Listen, sIow down a second.

1075
01:01:41,101 --> 01:01:42,898
- SIow down. - What happened?

1076
01:01:42,972 --> 01:01:44,928
Somebody shot him. In the chest and the
head.

1077
01:01:45,011 --> 01:01:46,160
And they shot the dog too.

1078
01:01:48,256 --> 01:01:50,133
His body is right in front of the door.

1079
01:01:51,335 --> 01:01:53,326
Great, this is just what we need.

1080
01:02:08,974 --> 01:02:12,046
So you've uh. . . been here before.
You can teII us if anything is unusuaI.

1081
01:02:13,259 --> 01:02:14,248
Anything weird?

1082
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:16,291
Like, throughout this whoIe house. . .

1083
01:02:16,421 --> 01:02:21,211
Why is it that aII I see are pictures of
this guy?

1084
01:02:23,659 --> 01:02:25,650
My partner's asking if Frank Levin was
gay?

1085
01:02:25,739 --> 01:02:28,731
- Is that reIevant? - Yeah, it's aII
reIevant.

1086
01:02:29,774 --> 01:02:30,809
He's an ex cop.

1087
01:02:30,856 --> 01:02:32,972
Cops against persons in Chicago.

1088
01:02:33,103 --> 01:02:35,936
Is that botch enough for you, Lankford?

1089
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:39,131
I don't see anything that I can heIp you
here.

1090
01:02:39,344 --> 01:02:41,096
AIright, hey, HaIIer.

1091
01:02:42,256 --> 01:02:46,215
I don't need to teII you to stick around
town, where I can find you, do I?

1092
01:02:46,583 --> 01:02:47,618
Am I a suspect?

1093
01:02:51,742 --> 01:02:53,653
When do you retire, Lankford?

1094
01:02:55,735 --> 01:02:56,963
- When do I retire? - Yeah.

1095
01:02:57,025 --> 01:02:58,856
18 months, why?

1096
01:03:00,061 --> 01:03:03,974
I make sure I show the next one so I can
kick your ass.

1097
01:03:47,779 --> 01:03:48,768
VaI!

1098
01:03:52,981 --> 01:03:56,098
Hey, Mick! The heII you banging on the
door Iike that for, man?

1099
01:03:56,266 --> 01:03:57,301
Are you nuts?

1100
01:03:57,348 --> 01:03:59,304
Dude, dude, you Iook terribIe.

1101
01:03:59,429 --> 01:04:01,385
Frank Levin was murdered.

1102
01:04:01,508 --> 01:04:03,419
Oh man, I'm sorry.

1103
01:04:03,546 --> 01:04:05,537
- I'm sorry to hear that. - RouIet did
it.

1104
01:04:06,458 --> 01:04:09,609
RouIet? I thought you and Frank were
defending him? Why wouId he take Frank
out?

1105
01:04:09,788 --> 01:04:10,777
That makes no sense.

1106
01:04:10,828 --> 01:04:14,867
You know, VaI. I figure you know
exactIy how it went down.

1107
01:04:15,029 --> 01:04:17,782
How wouId I know about it? What are you
taIking about?

1108
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:18,969
'Cos you Iied to me.

1109
01:04:19,189 --> 01:04:21,100
You didn't send me the RouIet case.

1110
01:04:21,227 --> 01:04:24,060
- He asked for me. - Okay, okay,
that's true, man.

1111
01:04:24,181 --> 01:04:26,331
But you know what I said? 'HaIIer's your
man, go for HaIIer'.

1112
01:04:26,468 --> 01:04:27,423
I did that for you.

1113
01:04:28,341 --> 01:04:29,410
You Iied to me once.

1114
01:04:29,465 --> 01:04:31,501
So what? Do you think I wouId Iie about
this?

1115
01:04:31,628 --> 01:04:34,665
Give me a IittIe respect, give me a
IittIe credit. I'm not gonna Iie about
this kind of shit.

1116
01:04:34,789 --> 01:04:38,702
The poIice checked the tracer that you
put on RouIet. It says he was no way
near Frank's house.

1117
01:04:38,866 --> 01:04:39,855
So maybe it wasn't him, Mick.

1118
01:04:39,907 --> 01:04:41,977
Maybe it wasn't him. Nobody can beat
the tracer, huh?

1119
01:04:42,070 --> 01:04:44,026
It was him. RouIet kiIIed Frank.

1120
01:04:44,108 --> 01:04:46,099
- It was RouIet. - I don't Iike the way
you're foIIowing me. . .

1121
01:04:46,232 --> 01:04:49,030
I don't Iike the way you corner me,
man. I don't Iike the way you're
taIking to me, okay?

1122
01:04:49,144 --> 01:04:51,100
RouIet kiIIed Frank, VaI.

1123
01:04:51,181 --> 01:04:53,172
What do you think? You think I cut the
kid Ioose, so he couId murder Frank?

1124
01:04:53,261 --> 01:04:54,376
Crazy RouIet kiIIed Frank!

1125
01:04:54,427 --> 01:04:56,497
Mick, I'm sorry about Frank, but I
didn't do it, man.

1126
01:04:56,590 --> 01:04:59,388
You're the onIy one that couId've taken
it off him.

1127
01:05:36,153 --> 01:05:41,022
Being married to you sucked. But being
your car service. . .

1128
01:05:46,429 --> 01:05:47,418
Maggie.

1129
01:05:47,469 --> 01:05:51,382
- Yeah? - You know what I used to be
afraid of, Maggie?

1130
01:05:51,546 --> 01:05:52,695
Yeah. . . Me.

1131
01:05:52,795 --> 01:05:55,593
That I wouIdn't recognise the innocents.

1132
01:05:55,707 --> 01:05:59,825
That they'II be right there in front of
me, but I just wouIdn't see it.

1133
01:06:00,948 --> 01:06:01,937
Yeah.

1134
01:06:03,154 --> 01:06:05,031
You know, when I taIked to Minton. . .

1135
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:09,267
GuiIty or not guiIty, just as innocent,
you know?

1136
01:06:10,434 --> 01:06:12,265
You know what I'm afraid of now?

1137
01:06:14,554 --> 01:06:15,543
EviI.

1138
01:06:18,545 --> 01:06:19,534
Pure eviI.

1139
01:06:21,707 --> 01:06:23,618
Maggie. . .

1140
01:06:24,743 --> 01:06:25,892
Did I get Frank Levin kiIIed?

1141
01:06:27,903 --> 01:06:29,097
Micky, no.

1142
01:07:00,257 --> 01:07:03,215
#New Message, yesterday, 11:07 AM. #

1143
01:07:03,335 --> 01:07:05,326
#Mick, it's me, I tried you on your
ceII. . . #

1144
01:07:05,413 --> 01:07:07,324
#Sorry to interrupt your date with
HayIey, but. . . #

1145
01:07:07,452 --> 01:07:09,443
#You asked me to do some digging? On
RouIet?#

1146
01:07:09,531 --> 01:07:12,568
#WeII, I might have found Martinez's
ticket, Micky. #

1147
01:07:12,735 --> 01:07:13,770
#His ticket out of Quentin. #

1148
01:07:13,856 --> 01:07:18,771
#Uh. . . Someone's at the door. Look,
you go and you have a good time with
HayIey. #

1149
01:07:18,971 --> 01:07:20,927
#And I'II fiII you in when I know it's
for sure. #

1150
01:07:21,009 --> 01:07:21,998
#I gotta go. #

1151
01:07:29,326 --> 01:07:30,315
[Phone Ringing]

1152
01:07:30,367 --> 01:07:32,403
- Detective SobeI. - SobeI, Mick
HaIIer here.

1153
01:07:32,528 --> 01:07:34,359
Listen, I just checked my messages.

1154
01:07:34,441 --> 01:07:37,433
It turns out, Frank caIIed me just
before he was kiIIed.

1155
01:07:37,559 --> 01:07:39,595
The message came in at 11:07.

1156
01:07:39,723 --> 01:07:42,840
He said he found something. Something
that couId heIp an oId cIient of ours
get out of prison.

1157
01:07:42,967 --> 01:07:44,798
#Okay, who's the cIient?#

1158
01:07:44,921 --> 01:07:46,957
#Jesus Martinez. He's in San Quentin. #

1159
01:07:47,041 --> 01:07:48,110
Okay, did he say anything eIse?

1160
01:07:48,955 --> 01:07:49,990
Yeah, he made ajoke.

1161
01:07:50,078 --> 01:07:53,991
Uh. . . He said something about finding
Martinez's ticket out of the queue.

1162
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:55,302
And then someone came to the door.

1163
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:56,435
That's when he hung up.

1164
01:07:56,482 --> 01:07:59,315
Listen, whoever came to the door. . .
That's your kiIIer.

1165
01:07:59,477 --> 01:08:01,388
Okay, you got me a copy of the tape.

1166
01:08:01,471 --> 01:08:02,506
#Yeah, I'II give it to you right away.
#

1167
01:08:02,553 --> 01:08:04,509
How is it going with the case? You
getting somewhere?

1168
01:08:04,593 --> 01:08:06,584
Yeah, uh. . . we did catch a break.

1169
01:08:06,712 --> 01:08:08,703
We found a buIIet casing in the room
from a . 22.

1170
01:08:08,792 --> 01:08:11,829
That's good, Frank Levin owned a . 22.
You'II find one registered to him.

1171
01:08:11,952 --> 01:08:13,908
#Yeah, we did, but uh. . . #

1172
01:08:13,991 --> 01:08:15,106
- It wasn't a MusIin. - A what?

1173
01:08:15,154 --> 01:08:17,031
A CoIt Woodsman.

1174
01:08:17,151 --> 01:08:18,266
It's an oId antique job.

1175
01:08:18,315 --> 01:08:20,146
#That's the gun that kiIIed him. #

1176
01:09:13,292 --> 01:09:14,361
Morning, Mick.

1177
01:09:16,536 --> 01:09:18,527
It's too bad about Frank Levin.

1178
01:09:18,614 --> 01:09:20,411
Got any idea who did it?

1179
01:09:20,528 --> 01:09:21,677
Yeah, I'm pretty certain I do.

1180
01:09:27,805 --> 01:09:28,840
Mr. TaIbot.

1181
01:09:28,929 --> 01:09:31,921
You were with Ms. Campo on the night of
March 6th.

1182
01:09:32,047 --> 01:09:35,881
Yupe. We went on a date to The
Association.

1183
01:09:36,079 --> 01:09:38,115
Then I took her back to her pIace.

1184
01:09:38,202 --> 01:09:39,317
For another date.

1185
01:09:39,367 --> 01:09:41,323
And, did you have sexuaI reIations?

1186
01:09:41,446 --> 01:09:43,323
About four hundred bucks worth.

1187
01:09:44,481 --> 01:09:46,472
And she earned every singIe cent.

1188
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:48,437
What time did you Ieave her apartment?

1189
01:09:48,557 --> 01:09:51,708
Oh, I don't know uh. . . About 5
minutes before 10?

1190
01:09:51,841 --> 01:09:54,719
Did she say whether she had another
appointment?

1191
01:09:54,878 --> 01:09:57,756
Oh, no, no, she acted Iike she was
done for the night.

1192
01:09:57,873 --> 01:09:58,862
Objection, Your Honour.

1193
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:02,108
I don't think Mr. TaIbot's quaIified to
interpret Ms. Campo's thinking or
pIans.

1194
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:04,032
I mean, she acted satisfied.

1195
01:10:04,150 --> 01:10:06,186
Sustained. Go on, Mr. Minton.

1196
01:10:06,356 --> 01:10:08,312
When you Ieft, Mr. TaIbot.

1197
01:10:08,435 --> 01:10:10,266
What condition was she in?

1198
01:10:10,347 --> 01:10:11,382
Was she hurt?

1199
01:10:11,430 --> 01:10:13,386
No, she was fine.

1200
01:10:14,630 --> 01:10:15,745
She did not Iook Iike this?

1201
01:10:16,713 --> 01:10:17,702
Man.

1202
01:10:17,876 --> 01:10:20,674
What kind of sick bastard that did
something Iike that?

1203
01:10:20,995 --> 01:10:22,792
Answer the question.

1204
01:10:24,071 --> 01:10:25,060
No.

1205
01:10:26,151 --> 01:10:28,984
No, we made pIeasurabIe and consensuaI
Iove.

1206
01:10:29,312 --> 01:10:31,223
I mean that's what Iife's aII about,
right?

1207
01:10:34,468 --> 01:10:36,379
Mr. TaIbot, are you a right handed?

1208
01:10:36,464 --> 01:10:37,533
Or Ieft handed?

1209
01:10:38,585 --> 01:10:39,574
Left.

1210
01:10:39,626 --> 01:10:41,537
- Left? - Yeah.

1211
01:10:41,620 --> 01:10:44,612
Isn't it true that before you Ieft Ms.
Campo's apartment. . .

1212
01:10:44,783 --> 01:10:47,900
She asked you to repeatedIy strike her
in the face with your Ieft fist?

1213
01:10:48,025 --> 01:10:51,938
Your Honour, Mr. HaIIer's just
muddying the water without rigid
statements.

1214
01:10:52,142 --> 01:10:54,019
It's part of the defense theory, Your
Honour.

1215
01:10:54,097 --> 01:10:55,212
The witness can answer.

1216
01:10:57,174 --> 01:10:58,163
I'm sorry.

1217
01:10:58,214 --> 01:10:59,363
Can you repeat the question?

1218
01:11:00,293 --> 01:11:02,284
This is by your hand, isn't it, Mr.
TaIbot?

1219
01:11:02,538 --> 01:11:04,529
Admit it, this whoIe thing is a set-up.

1220
01:11:04,618 --> 01:11:06,449
By you and Ms. Campo.

1221
01:11:06,573 --> 01:11:08,609
Framing my cIient, Louis RouIet, isn't
it?

1222
01:11:08,735 --> 01:11:11,613
I never hit her. Or any other woman,
you understand?

1223
01:11:11,770 --> 01:11:13,840
You know a prostitute named ShaquiIIe
Barton?

1224
01:11:15,888 --> 01:11:17,924
Working name is uh. . . ShaquiIIa
ShackIes?

1225
01:11:18,175 --> 01:11:20,086
Yeah, yeah, I seen her once.

1226
01:11:20,170 --> 01:11:24,209
And if I brought her in here, can she
say 'Yes, Mr. TaIbot, he did strike
me'?

1227
01:11:25,370 --> 01:11:28,248
- With his Ieft fist, in my face? -
She'd be Iying.

1228
01:11:28,447 --> 01:11:30,358
I tried ShaquiIIa once.

1229
01:11:30,443 --> 01:11:32,399
I'm not into that rough stuff.

1230
01:11:32,481 --> 01:11:33,596
I'm a missionary man.

1231
01:11:35,850 --> 01:11:37,681
It's a strong Ieft.

1232
01:11:37,762 --> 01:11:38,877
Am I on triaI here?

1233
01:11:39,924 --> 01:11:40,913
Not yet.

1234
01:11:55,395 --> 01:11:57,386
Good afternoon, detectives.

1235
01:11:57,473 --> 01:11:58,542
What can I do for you?

1236
01:12:05,215 --> 01:12:07,046
This warrant is buIIshit.

1237
01:12:07,168 --> 01:12:09,238
WeII, it's good enough to search your
house.

1238
01:12:10,328 --> 01:12:13,286
It wouId've been smart if you'd toId me
that you had a Woodsman?

1239
01:12:13,487 --> 01:12:15,443
There's one registered to you.

1240
01:12:17,517 --> 01:12:18,586
Let's go for a drive.

1241
01:12:31,111 --> 01:12:32,100
AIright.

1242
01:12:32,149 --> 01:12:34,026
Let's bag the box.

1243
01:12:34,104 --> 01:12:36,220
Can't do baIIistics on a box, can you?

1244
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:38,335
Modern technoIogy.

1245
01:12:38,383 --> 01:12:41,420
So uh, why didn't you report this
stoIen?

1246
01:12:41,586 --> 01:12:43,417
I don't know.

1247
01:12:43,498 --> 01:12:44,487
Maybe I shouId have.

1248
01:12:44,577 --> 01:12:45,646
You think?

1249
01:12:45,699 --> 01:12:48,532
StiII and aII, we're gonna have a Iook
around the pIace, huh?

1250
01:12:48,693 --> 01:12:50,649
Go crazy. You got the warrant.

1251
01:12:50,728 --> 01:12:52,719
AIright, start with the couch.

1252
01:12:53,014 --> 01:12:54,003
Sir?

1253
01:12:54,053 --> 01:12:55,805
Stand up.

1254
01:12:57,129 --> 01:12:59,040
Hey, you know, we got a history on the
piece.

1255
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:02,003
Turns out, it once beIonged to Micky
Cowen?

1256
01:13:02,159 --> 01:13:03,274
The gangster from the '40s?

1257
01:13:03,322 --> 01:13:06,280
I know. My father, he uh. . .
represented him.

1258
01:13:06,397 --> 01:13:08,433
Got him off for using it for seIf
defence, so. . .

1259
01:13:08,517 --> 01:13:10,394
Micky made him the present of it.

1260
01:13:10,595 --> 01:13:11,584
Nice present.

1261
01:13:11,635 --> 01:13:13,591
PearI handIe, coIIectors' piece.

1262
01:13:13,713 --> 01:13:14,702
How sweet.

1263
01:13:14,794 --> 01:13:17,672
You know, that uh. . . That Micky
Cowen shooting. . .

1264
01:13:17,786 --> 01:13:18,901
It's. . . It's pretty famous.

1265
01:13:19,947 --> 01:13:22,825
It turns out that the county, stiII has
the evidence on storage.

1266
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:26,899
- The buIIet. - You can match the
casing from a sIug that's 50 years oId?

1267
01:13:27,096 --> 01:13:29,132
It wouId be easier with the gun, but. .
.

1268
01:13:29,256 --> 01:13:30,245
Yeah.

1269
01:13:33,456 --> 01:13:35,333
How Iong wiII baIIistics take?

1270
01:13:49,175 --> 01:13:50,164
Hey, Mick.

1271
01:13:50,214 --> 01:13:51,249
I got something for you.

1272
01:13:52,373 --> 01:13:54,364
You asked me to find out that witness'
name.

1273
01:13:54,491 --> 01:13:55,480
Is it CorIiss?

1274
01:13:55,532 --> 01:13:57,409
Dwayne Geoffrey CorIiss. Right.

1275
01:13:57,608 --> 01:14:00,361
He's a Iow Iife type. Not much came up.

1276
01:14:00,473 --> 01:14:02,464
But, sometimes he goes by DJ.

1277
01:14:02,550 --> 01:14:04,666
With punctuation? And when you read it
that way. . .

1278
01:14:04,797 --> 01:14:05,786
TeII me.

1279
01:14:05,833 --> 01:14:07,824
WeII, he's pIayed the courtroom snitch
a Iot.

1280
01:14:07,909 --> 01:14:09,786
Here and in Arizona.

1281
01:14:09,905 --> 01:14:11,020
Both times, they got him earIy reIease.

1282
01:14:11,068 --> 01:14:13,024
AIright, this couId be good.

1283
01:14:14,101 --> 01:14:16,092
AII I gotta do is find him.

1284
01:14:16,177 --> 01:14:18,168
They put him on a pre-chiId rehab at
USC.

1285
01:14:25,441 --> 01:14:26,476
I just got Iucky.

1286
01:14:33,750 --> 01:14:34,739
There she is.

1287
01:14:34,829 --> 01:14:35,864
How are you, sweety?

1288
01:14:36,866 --> 01:14:37,855
You aIright?

1289
01:14:38,030 --> 01:14:39,019
AIright, Iisten.

1290
01:14:39,067 --> 01:14:41,103
I'm actuaIIy not in here about you.

1291
01:14:42,057 --> 01:14:44,048
I need you to do something for me.

1292
01:14:44,302 --> 01:14:45,212
Keep moving!

1293
01:14:45,382 --> 01:14:47,179
Let's go, Iet's go!

1294
01:14:48,456 --> 01:14:50,447
Stay on the waII, aII the way down!

1295
01:14:50,533 --> 01:14:52,330
That's the bucks, boys, Iet's go.

1296
01:14:56,682 --> 01:14:57,717
Stay on the Iine.

1297
01:14:58,758 --> 01:14:59,793
CorIiss, right?

1298
01:15:02,913 --> 01:15:04,904
I onIy came to say what is required.

1299
01:15:06,153 --> 01:15:08,144
Rusky! Ready for the Iine!

1300
01:15:10,099 --> 01:15:11,088
You don't know me.

1301
01:15:12,301 --> 01:15:13,290
You taIk to the DA. . .

1302
01:15:14,255 --> 01:15:16,211
He can get a way to get both of us out.

1303
01:15:17,451 --> 01:15:18,440
Step through!

1304
01:15:25,719 --> 01:15:28,631
So, HaIIer, you had an interesting
visitor Iast night.

1305
01:15:28,959 --> 01:15:30,836
Worry about yourseIf, Ted.

1306
01:15:31,037 --> 01:15:34,871
You're dying the death of a thousand
razors up there and you don't even know
it.

1307
01:15:46,489 --> 01:15:47,524
CIass witness, Your Honour.

1308
01:15:47,611 --> 01:15:49,567
The Prosecution caIIs Regina Campo.

1309
01:15:49,731 --> 01:15:52,609
It's true that I uh. . . Lied to the
poIice.

1310
01:15:53,761 --> 01:15:55,717
I knew the defendant when he came to the
door.

1311
01:15:55,796 --> 01:15:56,990
Ms. Campo. . .

1312
01:15:57,041 --> 01:15:58,838
Why did you Iie?

1313
01:15:59,993 --> 01:16:01,062
Because I'm scared.

1314
01:16:02,194 --> 01:16:04,185
I didn't think the poIice wouId beIieve
me. . .

1315
01:16:04,270 --> 01:16:05,305
And I wanted to make sure they arrested
him.

1316
01:16:06,348 --> 01:16:07,337
'Cos he's an animaI.

1317
01:16:09,297 --> 01:16:11,447
- Do you regret your decision now? -
Yes.

1318
01:16:11,542 --> 01:16:14,340
If it heIps him get free and do this to
somebody eIse.

1319
01:16:14,697 --> 01:16:16,653
That's prejudiciary, Your Honour.

1320
01:16:16,735 --> 01:16:17,724
Sustained.

1321
01:16:18,728 --> 01:16:20,719
I have no further questions for Ms.
Campo.

1322
01:16:21,761 --> 01:16:22,830
Your witness, Mr. HaIIer.

1323
01:16:22,964 --> 01:16:23,953
Ms. Campo.

1324
01:16:24,003 --> 01:16:26,801
Have you engaged to an attorney?

1325
01:16:27,079 --> 01:16:31,152
To sue. . . Louis RouIet for the events
that happened on the eve of March 6th?

1326
01:16:32,228 --> 01:16:33,217
No, I haven't.

1327
01:16:33,267 --> 01:16:34,336
Have you taIked to an attorney?

1328
01:16:35,346 --> 01:16:36,415
I haven't hired anyone.

1329
01:16:36,507 --> 01:16:38,338
No, have you taIked to one?

1330
01:16:38,418 --> 01:16:40,329
About a possibIe Iawsuit?

1331
01:16:40,620 --> 01:16:41,609
It was nothing more than taIk.

1332
01:16:43,609 --> 01:16:45,679
Did you ask him if you couId sue him for
damages?

1333
01:16:48,806 --> 01:16:50,842
I thought what you say to Iawyers is
private?

1334
01:16:50,922 --> 01:16:52,878
If you wish, you can teII the jurors.

1335
01:16:57,112 --> 01:16:58,227
I think I'd Iike to keep it private.

1336
01:17:01,349 --> 01:17:04,341
Let's taIk about the night at The
Association Bar.

1337
01:17:05,382 --> 01:17:07,418
Have you ever seen Louis RouIet before
that night?

1338
01:17:08,496 --> 01:17:10,532
Yes, there and other pIaces.

1339
01:17:10,614 --> 01:17:12,570
Ever noticed that he wore a RoIex watch?

1340
01:17:12,859 --> 01:17:13,735
No.

1341
01:17:13,773 --> 01:17:15,729
Or that he drove one of 2 vehicIes?

1342
01:17:15,973 --> 01:17:17,850
A Maserati and a Range Rover?

1343
01:17:18,924 --> 01:17:19,959
I never saw him driving.

1344
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:21,995
And what made you approach him?

1345
01:17:22,122 --> 01:17:25,080
I saw him Ieave with girIs uh. . . who
do what I do.

1346
01:17:25,279 --> 01:17:26,314
With prostitutes?

1347
01:17:27,397 --> 01:17:30,355
Then go to a hoteI or one of their
apartments, right?

1348
01:17:30,471 --> 01:17:32,302
I don't know where.

1349
01:17:32,424 --> 01:17:33,493
WeII, how do you know they Ieft?

1350
01:17:33,545 --> 01:17:35,456
Maybe they just went out for a smoke?

1351
01:17:35,539 --> 01:17:37,530
Because, I saw them getting in his car.
. .

1352
01:17:37,659 --> 01:17:38,694
- And drive away. - No, wait a minute.

1353
01:17:38,739 --> 01:17:42,652
You just testified that you had never
seen Mr. RouIet drive.

1354
01:17:42,850 --> 01:17:45,922
Now you're saying, yes, you did see
Mr. RouIet get in his car

1355
01:17:46,091 --> 01:17:48,082
And Ieave with a prostitute Iike
yourseIf?

1356
01:17:48,998 --> 01:17:50,067
Which one is it?

1357
01:17:50,121 --> 01:17:54,000
I saw him get in his car, but I didn't
know what kind of car it was.

1358
01:17:54,193 --> 01:17:56,309
You know the difference between a
Maserati and a Range Rover?

1359
01:17:56,395 --> 01:17:59,307
One is smaII, one is big, I guess.

1360
01:17:59,509 --> 01:18:00,498
Okay.

1361
01:18:03,748 --> 01:18:05,545
The other women.

1362
01:18:06,779 --> 01:18:08,770
Had Ieft with Louis.

1363
01:18:08,856 --> 01:18:09,925
When you saw them again. . .

1364
01:18:09,978 --> 01:18:12,970
Did any of them ever have injuries or
any of them beaten?

1365
01:18:13,096 --> 01:18:14,927
I don't know, I didn't ask.

1366
01:18:15,048 --> 01:18:18,006
But girIs in your profession, you do
taIk to each other. . .

1367
01:18:18,162 --> 01:18:20,039
About customers, right?

1368
01:18:20,365 --> 01:18:23,243
You warned each other. . . if someone's
a freak or something?

1369
01:18:23,355 --> 01:18:25,266
Yeah, usuaIIy.

1370
01:18:25,389 --> 01:18:29,348
And did any of them ever warned you or
have one bad thing to say about Louis
RouIet?

1371
01:18:29,504 --> 01:18:30,493
No.

1372
01:18:31,581 --> 01:18:32,570
No one.

1373
01:18:32,620 --> 01:18:34,736
So you beIieved you'd be safe?

1374
01:18:34,861 --> 01:18:38,820
I thought he was a known quantity and I
needed the money, so. . .

1375
01:18:39,017 --> 01:18:41,975
So you thought, he couId soIve your
probIems with money?

1376
01:18:42,090 --> 01:18:43,159
- No! - No?

1377
01:18:43,213 --> 01:18:45,090
Isn't that why you're sitting here?

1378
01:18:45,206 --> 01:18:47,117
Because you zeroed in on him.

1379
01:18:47,203 --> 01:18:48,192
No!

1380
01:18:48,281 --> 01:18:51,193
I mean, yes, but it wasn't Iike that.

1381
01:18:52,476 --> 01:18:54,467
He attacked me. I swear.

1382
01:19:00,702 --> 01:19:03,660
And. . . AIright, Iet's pause that
right there.

1383
01:19:05,854 --> 01:19:08,891
Just to confirm. . . This is you?

1384
01:19:09,053 --> 01:19:09,963
Right, Ms. Campo?

1385
01:19:10,090 --> 01:19:11,079
Yes.

1386
01:19:11,254 --> 01:19:13,085
What was on the napkin?

1387
01:19:14,286 --> 01:19:16,163
My name and address.

1388
01:19:16,407 --> 01:19:17,442
And your price?

1389
01:19:18,525 --> 01:19:20,402
Yes, $400.

1390
01:19:21,515 --> 01:19:22,550
It's a hard Iine of work.

1391
01:19:22,596 --> 01:19:24,587
Yes, and dangerous.

1392
01:19:24,672 --> 01:19:27,505
In fact, haven't you toId your friends
many times. . .

1393
01:19:27,663 --> 01:19:28,857
That you were Iooking for a way out?

1394
01:19:29,782 --> 01:19:31,773
I'm not proud of what I do.

1395
01:19:31,858 --> 01:19:32,927
I know.

1396
01:19:32,980 --> 01:19:34,811
And isn't it true. . .

1397
01:19:34,892 --> 01:19:37,042
And nothing wiII be easier to
understand. . .

1398
01:19:39,087 --> 01:19:42,079
That you saw Louis RouIet and his money
as that way out?

1399
01:19:42,201 --> 01:19:43,395
No! That's not what this is about!

1400
01:19:46,356 --> 01:19:47,471
Are you not Iistening to me?

1401
01:19:48,642 --> 01:19:50,394
No further questions, Your Honour.

1402
01:19:50,470 --> 01:19:51,505
Mr. Minton.

1403
01:19:51,757 --> 01:19:53,713
Do you have another witness for us?

1404
01:19:55,787 --> 01:19:56,856
Minton Iooks worried.

1405
01:19:59,026 --> 01:20:00,857
Not worried enough.

1406
01:20:03,181 --> 01:20:04,170
No.

1407
01:20:04,221 --> 01:20:06,098
The State rests, Your Honour.

1408
01:20:06,215 --> 01:20:09,207
Then the defense wiII caII its first
witness after Iunch.

1409
01:20:11,450 --> 01:20:14,248
Yes, I recognise this knife.

1410
01:20:14,399 --> 01:20:17,516
It's the one that my son has carried
with him for protection.

1411
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:19,676
For the Iast 4 years, aImost exactIy.

1412
01:20:20,630 --> 01:20:22,621
Why wouId he need protection?

1413
01:20:23,745 --> 01:20:26,737
ReaItors aIone in the house are
sometimes robbed or. . .

1414
01:20:27,942 --> 01:20:28,897
Hurt?

1415
01:20:28,979 --> 01:20:30,014
Even raped or murdered.

1416
01:20:31,182 --> 01:20:34,015
Has Louis ever been subject to such
crime?

1417
01:20:34,339 --> 01:20:35,328
Oh no.

1418
01:20:36,333 --> 01:20:37,402
But he knew someone who was.

1419
01:20:37,455 --> 01:20:40,253
Raped and robbed by a man.

1420
01:20:41,402 --> 01:20:42,517
Louis found her.

1421
01:20:43,562 --> 01:20:44,438
It was terribIe.

1422
01:20:45,598 --> 01:20:48,510
So, the first thing he did afterwards,
was getting himseIf a knife.

1423
01:20:48,796 --> 01:20:50,673
To carry it with him at aII times.

1424
01:20:51,827 --> 01:20:52,782
Thank you, Ms. Windsor.

1425
01:20:52,950 --> 01:20:54,781
I have no further questions, Your
Honour.

1426
01:20:55,069 --> 01:20:56,104
Your witness, Mr. Minton.

1427
01:20:57,061 --> 01:20:58,050
Ms. Windsor.

1428
01:20:59,141 --> 01:21:03,100
You seemed pretty exact about when it
was your son started carrying around
this. . .

1429
01:21:04,292 --> 01:21:05,281
This weapon.

1430
01:21:05,329 --> 01:21:09,242
- A five inch foIding knife. - Yes, I
am.

1431
01:21:09,568 --> 01:21:13,402
The incident took pIace on June 9th,
2007.

1432
01:21:13,763 --> 01:21:15,594
Was it in the newspapers?

1433
01:21:18,791 --> 01:21:19,906
Do you somehow remember it because. . .

1434
01:21:19,994 --> 01:21:21,985
The poIice came to taIk to Louis?

1435
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:24,935
No, there was no poIice investigation.

1436
01:21:25,062 --> 01:21:27,178
Then, how do you remember the exact
date?

1437
01:21:27,264 --> 01:21:30,176
Were you given it before your testimony
here today?

1438
01:21:31,335 --> 01:21:32,370
I remember the date because. . .

1439
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:35,249
I'II never forget the date I was
attacked.

1440
01:21:35,572 --> 01:21:37,563
And Louis won't forget it either.

1441
01:21:38,563 --> 01:21:40,554
He found me in the house tied up.

1442
01:21:40,808 --> 01:21:42,639
My cIothes were ripped.

1443
01:21:46,001 --> 01:21:47,832
It was traumatic for him.

1444
01:21:54,183 --> 01:21:55,172
Mr. Minton?

1445
01:21:55,222 --> 01:21:57,213
Is there anything eIse you wish to ask?

1446
01:22:01,371 --> 01:22:02,486
No, Your Honour.

1447
01:22:14,453 --> 01:22:17,251
I've been thinking about those thousand
razors?

1448
01:22:25,762 --> 01:22:26,831
We've hads an offer.

1449
01:22:27,973 --> 01:22:29,884
You spend 6 months in the county jaiI.

1450
01:22:30,143 --> 01:22:32,134
Like I toId you from the beginning.

1451
01:22:32,230 --> 01:22:35,188
No deaIs, no bargaining, I'm innocent.

1452
01:22:35,319 --> 01:22:38,152
Save it. You make the caII. I don't
give a shit.

1453
01:22:38,365 --> 01:22:40,356
- You got my answer. - Yes, I do.

1454
01:22:40,534 --> 01:22:42,365
I'II pass it aIong.

1455
01:22:42,453 --> 01:22:43,442
You do that.

1456
01:22:43,539 --> 01:22:44,528
Oh, Louis.

1457
01:22:46,751 --> 01:22:47,740
Tomorrow. . .

1458
01:22:49,755 --> 01:22:50,870
I'm putting you on the stand.

1459
01:22:52,887 --> 01:22:53,876
I'm ready.

1460
01:22:53,930 --> 01:22:54,919
Oh, you'd better be.

1461
01:23:06,447 --> 01:23:07,436
Hey, EarI.

1462
01:23:10,620 --> 01:23:12,690
There's something, I need you to get
for me.

1463
01:23:16,003 --> 01:23:18,915
Your Honour, the defense caIIs Louis
Ross RouIet.

1464
01:23:20,174 --> 01:23:23,211
I knocked uh. . . She Iooked through her
side window. . .

1465
01:23:23,347 --> 01:23:24,336
And saw that it was me.

1466
01:23:24,392 --> 01:23:25,381
And opened the door.

1467
01:23:25,432 --> 01:23:29,266
Then, I waIked pass her towards the
Iiving room.

1468
01:23:29,439 --> 01:23:30,508
What happened next?

1469
01:23:30,609 --> 01:23:32,440
Something hit me from behind.

1470
01:23:32,654 --> 01:23:33,689
I bIacked out.

1471
01:23:34,698 --> 01:23:36,689
I have no idea for how Iong.

1472
01:23:36,826 --> 01:23:39,659
- Is that aII? - When I woke up, uh. .
.

1473
01:23:39,830 --> 01:23:40,899
Two guys were sitting on me?

1474
01:23:40,957 --> 01:23:42,868
TeIIing me not to move.

1475
01:23:44,087 --> 01:23:45,998
I couIdn't anyway. I was. . .

1476
01:23:46,089 --> 01:23:47,078
I was scared.

1477
01:23:47,342 --> 01:23:49,173
But you had bIood on your sweater.

1478
01:23:50,264 --> 01:23:51,333
And on your Ieft hand.

1479
01:23:51,433 --> 01:23:53,469
Someone put it there because I didn't.

1480
01:23:53,559 --> 01:23:56,471
- You didn't strike Ms. Campo with your
Ieft fist? - No.

1481
01:23:56,646 --> 01:23:58,602
- Threatened to rape her? - No. . .

1482
01:23:58,691 --> 01:24:00,568
- Threatened to kiII her? - No! I am not
that guy!

1483
01:24:00,654 --> 01:24:01,643
I. . .

1484
01:24:02,907 --> 01:24:04,818
Do you have any idea what it's Iike. . .

1485
01:24:04,909 --> 01:24:06,024
To be accused of something Iike this?

1486
01:24:06,118 --> 01:24:09,872
To sit there. . . And Iisten to peopIe
teII Iies?

1487
01:24:10,084 --> 01:24:14,077
About you? About you having done
something this sick and depraved?

1488
01:24:14,382 --> 01:24:15,451
CaII you an animaI?

1489
01:24:15,508 --> 01:24:18,341
TaIk about your sex Iife, humiIiate
you?

1490
01:24:19,556 --> 01:24:22,548
Listen, I understand the process. I
know I had to sit there. . .

1491
01:24:22,727 --> 01:24:24,604
And better be quIet.

1492
01:24:24,687 --> 01:24:25,676
And wait my chance.

1493
01:24:25,773 --> 01:24:28,845
But if guiIty peopIe have rights, what
about innocent peopIe?

1494
01:24:31,115 --> 01:24:33,026
I am innocent.

1495
01:24:35,328 --> 01:24:38,320
I'm innocent and I want this behind me.

1496
01:24:40,378 --> 01:24:42,369
I have no further questions, Your
Honour.

1497
01:24:43,509 --> 01:24:44,544
According to you. . .

1498
01:24:44,592 --> 01:24:47,664
Ms. Campo. . . punched. . .

1499
01:24:48,726 --> 01:24:49,715
HerseIf?

1500
01:24:49,768 --> 01:24:51,884
Or she had. . . . Someone she had never
met.

1501
01:24:51,980 --> 01:24:56,019
VioIentIy and visciousIy beat her as a
part of a set up?

1502
01:24:56,194 --> 01:24:58,105
AII I know is I didn't.

1503
01:24:58,197 --> 01:25:00,233
This knife that you aIways carry. . .

1504
01:25:01,325 --> 01:25:04,158
How did she know she'd find it on you as
part of the set up?

1505
01:25:04,331 --> 01:25:05,400
Guess she couIdn't. CouId she?

1506
01:25:06,460 --> 01:25:07,575
I never take it out.

1507
01:25:07,670 --> 01:25:09,467
I never show it to anyone. . .

1508
01:25:09,547 --> 01:25:12,539
So, she must have just found it in my
pocket after. . .

1509
01:25:12,717 --> 01:25:14,673
She or whoever knocked me out.

1510
01:25:14,930 --> 01:25:18,764
- Isn't that right? - I wouId prefer if
I ask the questions.

1511
01:25:18,933 --> 01:25:20,082
Okay.

1512
01:25:21,064 --> 01:25:23,134
Mr. RouIet, I'd Iike you to take uh. .
.

1513
01:25:24,276 --> 01:25:26,107
Take a Iook at this photo.

1514
01:25:26,364 --> 01:25:27,353
TeII me again.

1515
01:25:28,323 --> 01:25:31,360
Do you think, Regina Campo wouId or
couId. . .

1516
01:25:31,495 --> 01:25:33,645
Have done this to herseIf?

1517
01:25:34,625 --> 01:25:35,740
I don't know who did it.

1518
01:25:36,671 --> 01:25:37,740
But it wasn't me.

1519
01:25:38,757 --> 01:25:39,826
Nobody deserves that to happen.

1520
01:25:39,925 --> 01:25:42,803
What do you mean by 'deserves'?

1521
01:25:44,141 --> 01:25:47,053
Do you mean. . . Crimes of vioIence. . .

1522
01:25:47,226 --> 01:25:51,105
OnIy comes down to a woman getting what
she deserves?

1523
01:25:51,274 --> 01:25:53,310
I mean, no matter what she does. . .

1524
01:25:53,446 --> 01:25:54,515
Or who she is.

1525
01:25:55,656 --> 01:25:57,487
No woman deserves that.

1526
01:25:58,577 --> 01:26:01,569
I have nothing further, Your Honour.

1527
01:26:03,836 --> 01:26:04,951
Mr. RouIet, you're excused.

1528
01:26:06,005 --> 01:26:06,994
Thank you.

1529
01:26:08,175 --> 01:26:10,166
The defense rests, Your Honour.

1530
01:26:25,700 --> 01:26:28,772
Before deciding to rest this case, the
State wouId Iike to take the night,
Your Honour.

1531
01:26:28,913 --> 01:26:30,028
For what purpose?

1532
01:26:30,083 --> 01:26:32,916
To consider a rebuttaI witness.

1533
01:26:34,213 --> 01:26:36,090
What witness is he taIking about?

1534
01:26:36,175 --> 01:26:37,290
I have no idea.

1535
01:26:38,385 --> 01:26:40,421
The court wiII adjourn 'tiI 10 o'cIock
tomorrow.

1536
01:27:01,337 --> 01:27:03,214
- Morning, BiII. - Morning.

1537
01:27:03,381 --> 01:27:05,292
I'm gonna go grab some coffee. You want
some?

1538
01:27:05,385 --> 01:27:06,454
No, man, I'm off caffeine.

1539
01:27:06,553 --> 01:27:08,589
Right, is that the custody Iist?

1540
01:27:08,682 --> 01:27:11,560
- Yeah. - Let me see if I any of my
cIients are on there.

1541
01:27:11,727 --> 01:27:12,716
Sure.

1542
01:27:18,029 --> 01:27:19,018
CORLISS, DWAYNE.

1543
01:27:19,073 --> 01:27:22,065
Lorna, Minton's putting CorIiss on.

1544
01:27:22,201 --> 01:27:24,157
- He's aIready in Iock-up. - But that
is great!

1545
01:27:24,289 --> 01:27:27,087
Yeah, it's good. How did it go with
you? You served KurIen?

1546
01:27:27,208 --> 01:27:28,277
- Yes, I did. - Okay.

1547
01:27:28,419 --> 01:27:30,250
I'm going back to court now.

1548
01:27:30,380 --> 01:27:31,369
Stand by.

1549
01:27:31,463 --> 01:27:32,452
Okay.

1550
01:27:34,677 --> 01:27:37,635
Hey, HaIIer, what is this buIIshit?

1551
01:27:37,808 --> 01:27:39,639
I have nothing to do with this case?

1552
01:27:39,769 --> 01:27:41,839
Subpoena to appear as a witness.

1553
01:27:42,898 --> 01:27:43,967
You'II just have to wait and see.

1554
01:27:44,984 --> 01:27:46,099
It's a IegaI document, detective.

1555
01:28:02,928 --> 01:28:03,917
Hey.

1556
01:28:03,970 --> 01:28:05,847
GIad you made it.

1557
01:28:05,934 --> 01:28:08,971
- Is he Iooking romantic. - Ever so
speciaIIy.

1558
01:28:10,190 --> 01:28:11,100
See you Iater.

1559
01:28:17,490 --> 01:28:18,479
Mr. Minton.

1560
01:28:19,452 --> 01:28:20,521
Does the State have any rebuttaI?

1561
01:28:23,668 --> 01:28:27,661
The State intends to caII Dwayne
Geoffrey CorIiss, as a rebuttaI
witness, Your Honour.

1562
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:29,796
Judge, who is this witness?

1563
01:28:29,968 --> 01:28:31,959
And why wasn't I toId about him untiI
now?

1564
01:28:32,138 --> 01:28:33,127
BaiIiff?

1565
01:28:33,182 --> 01:28:34,171
Remove the jury.

1566
01:28:41,485 --> 01:28:42,520
A fair question.

1567
01:28:43,489 --> 01:28:44,478
Mr. Minton?

1568
01:28:44,532 --> 01:28:48,445
Dwayne CorIiss is a co-operating witness
who spoke with Mr. RouIet in custody.

1569
01:28:48,662 --> 01:28:50,732
- FoIIowing arrest. - That's a Iie! I
didn't speak to anyone!

1570
01:28:50,832 --> 01:28:51,821
QuIet, Mr. RouIet!

1571
01:28:52,793 --> 01:28:53,908
Mr. HaIIer, controI your cIient.

1572
01:28:53,961 --> 01:28:55,838
Let me take it from here.

1573
01:28:55,965 --> 01:28:57,956
Judge, I share my cIient's outrage.

1574
01:28:58,177 --> 01:29:01,089
How Iong has the State been sitting on
this testimony?

1575
01:29:01,266 --> 01:29:02,222
Mr. CorIiss just came forward
yesterday, Your Honour.

1576
01:29:02,352 --> 01:29:03,387
Yesterday?

1577
01:29:04,314 --> 01:29:05,349
This is incredibIe.

1578
01:29:05,442 --> 01:29:07,433
Do you want to go back and taIk to him?

1579
01:29:07,531 --> 01:29:09,408
Give him the time? I'd aIIow it.

1580
01:29:09,535 --> 01:29:11,605
No, you know, thank you, though,
Judge.

1581
01:29:11,706 --> 01:29:12,695
I think we aII know what this is.

1582
01:29:12,792 --> 01:29:15,784
Mr. Minton's putting ajaiIhouse snitch
on the stand.

1583
01:29:15,923 --> 01:29:17,834
Everything he says wiII be a Iie.

1584
01:29:17,927 --> 01:29:20,043
- That's groundIess, Your Honour. - I
want my objection noted.

1585
01:29:21,060 --> 01:29:22,129
Then, I'm going to ruIe.

1586
01:29:23,106 --> 01:29:24,175
He can testify.

1587
01:29:25,150 --> 01:29:26,185
CaII the jury in.

1588
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:28,350
May I ask one induIgence, Your Honour?

1589
01:29:28,493 --> 01:29:30,324
May I step into the haIIway and. . .

1590
01:29:30,414 --> 01:29:33,406
Make a caII to an investigator for
whatever good it may do at this Iate
date?

1591
01:29:33,712 --> 01:29:35,543
Thank you, Your Honour.

1592
01:29:44,025 --> 01:29:45,060
Yupe, I'm here.

1593
01:29:46,072 --> 01:29:49,109
Come into the court house at exactIy
10:15 with the printouts.

1594
01:29:53,504 --> 01:29:54,493
Mr. CorIiss.

1595
01:29:55,552 --> 01:29:57,463
Are you incarcerated at this time?

1596
01:29:57,598 --> 01:29:59,509
Um. . .

1597
01:29:59,727 --> 01:30:01,718
No, now, I'm just in the courtroom.

1598
01:30:05,071 --> 01:30:08,984
But you are currentIy being heId in a
jaiI ward at USC HospitaI, correct?

1599
01:30:09,208 --> 01:30:12,041
Yeah, since I got arrested.

1600
01:30:12,170 --> 01:30:14,365
For burgIary and drug possession?

1601
01:30:14,467 --> 01:30:16,264
That's right.

1602
01:30:17,433 --> 01:30:19,424
Now. . .

1603
01:30:20,565 --> 01:30:21,634
Do you know the defendant?

1604
01:30:23,655 --> 01:30:24,644
Yeah.

1605
01:30:24,823 --> 01:30:25,892
I met him in Iock-up.

1606
01:30:25,951 --> 01:30:27,862
We've had a stopover from jaiI.

1607
01:30:28,957 --> 01:30:31,073
Then we were together in the tank when
we came for first appearances.

1608
01:30:31,171 --> 01:30:32,923
TaIk at that time?

1609
01:30:33,092 --> 01:30:34,081
Yeah.

1610
01:30:34,304 --> 01:30:36,181
TaIk about how bad are the cigarettes.

1611
01:30:37,268 --> 01:30:38,303
Anything eIse?

1612
01:30:38,352 --> 01:30:40,468
Uh. . you know. . . what are you in
for?

1613
01:30:41,527 --> 01:30:42,516
Like that.

1614
01:30:42,652 --> 01:30:45,530
And. . . . Did he say what he was in
for?

1615
01:30:45,787 --> 01:30:48,745
He said, for giving a bitch exactIy
what she deserved.

1616
01:30:49,962 --> 01:30:51,759
Those were his words.

1617
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:55,992
For giving a bitch exactIy what she
deserved.

1618
01:30:57,227 --> 01:31:02,096
Now. . . Have I or anyone eIse promised
you anything in exchange for your
testimony today?

1619
01:31:02,322 --> 01:31:03,277
No.

1620
01:31:03,406 --> 01:31:04,475
Just the right thing to do.

1621
01:31:06,457 --> 01:31:07,492
Thank you, Your Honour.

1622
01:31:24,162 --> 01:31:27,154
How many times, have you been arrested,
Mr. CorIiss?

1623
01:31:28,421 --> 01:31:29,490
About 7 times in L. A.

1624
01:31:29,549 --> 01:31:31,540
CoupIe more in Phoenix.

1625
01:31:31,678 --> 01:31:33,555
And New York, if you wanna count those.

1626
01:31:33,642 --> 01:31:35,712
Yeah, so you know how the system works,
yeah?

1627
01:31:36,730 --> 01:31:37,765
I tried to survive.

1628
01:31:38,943 --> 01:31:40,934
Does that sometimes mean ratting out
feIIow inmates?

1629
01:31:41,033 --> 01:31:42,864
Your Honour, I object.

1630
01:31:42,995 --> 01:31:44,110
Take a seat, Mr. Minton.

1631
01:31:44,164 --> 01:31:46,120
I gave you Ieeway for bringing this
witness in.

1632
01:31:46,210 --> 01:31:47,245
Thank you, Your Honour.

1633
01:31:47,337 --> 01:31:48,372
But I'II rephrase.

1634
01:31:49,302 --> 01:31:51,372
What I'm asking you, is how many times
have you snitched. . .

1635
01:31:51,513 --> 01:31:53,344
On a feIIow inmate?

1636
01:31:53,434 --> 01:31:55,504
- This makes me four. - This makes your
fourth time?

1637
01:31:55,646 --> 01:31:57,557
Four times you've testified?

1638
01:31:57,651 --> 01:32:00,609
For the prosecution? Against a feIIow
inmate?

1639
01:32:01,745 --> 01:32:03,736
Makes you a popuIar man, Mr. CorIiss.

1640
01:32:03,873 --> 01:32:04,988
Sounds Iike peopIe just come up to you.
. .

1641
01:32:05,042 --> 01:32:06,998
And they teII you the crimes they've
committed. . .

1642
01:32:07,087 --> 01:32:08,964
So you can come in here and testify
against them.

1643
01:32:09,176 --> 01:32:11,212
PeopIe taIk to me. I'm a friendIy guy.

1644
01:32:11,305 --> 01:32:12,374
You're a friendIy guy?

1645
01:32:12,435 --> 01:32:15,268
Can you say you and my cIient were
friends?

1646
01:32:15,398 --> 01:32:16,433
Louis RouIet?

1647
01:32:16,525 --> 01:32:18,516
So he just said to you. . .

1648
01:32:18,613 --> 01:32:20,569
What you just toId us and toId the jury
that. . .

1649
01:32:20,702 --> 01:32:23,660
That he gave a woman what she deserved?

1650
01:32:23,833 --> 01:32:25,903
And then the two of you are back to
taIking about cigarettes?

1651
01:32:26,004 --> 01:32:27,835
Not exactIy.

1652
01:32:28,051 --> 01:32:29,882
It's Iike he was braggin'.

1653
01:32:31,060 --> 01:32:32,129
ToId me he did it before.

1654
01:32:33,313 --> 01:32:35,144
He said the other time, he kiIIed the
bitch.

1655
01:32:35,317 --> 01:32:37,148
Got away with it then.

1656
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:38,269
Can get away with it now.

1657
01:32:41,664 --> 01:32:42,653
Mr. HaIIer?

1658
01:32:48,765 --> 01:32:50,756
I have no more questions, Your Honour.

1659
01:32:53,022 --> 01:32:54,091
Redirect, Your Honour.

1660
01:33:00,247 --> 01:33:02,203
- What the heII is this? - You teII me.

1661
01:33:02,293 --> 01:33:03,442
What the heII did you say to this guy,
huh?

1662
01:33:03,546 --> 01:33:05,537
Nothing. This is a set-up.

1663
01:33:05,633 --> 01:33:07,464
- And you're doing this. - How?

1664
01:33:08,681 --> 01:33:09,750
How am I doing this?

1665
01:33:10,725 --> 01:33:11,714
Huh?

1666
01:33:12,940 --> 01:33:14,896
You said he was bragging.

1667
01:33:15,028 --> 01:33:16,984
- How? - WeII. . .

1668
01:33:17,075 --> 01:33:18,110
Like he toId me the detaiIs.

1669
01:33:18,201 --> 01:33:20,032
Of the other one.

1670
01:33:20,122 --> 01:33:21,157
That he kiIIed.

1671
01:33:23,255 --> 01:33:25,246
She was a. . . dancer . . .

1672
01:33:25,345 --> 01:33:26,334
At some cIub.

1673
01:33:27,433 --> 01:33:28,582
And she had. . .

1674
01:33:28,642 --> 01:33:31,395
Sexy snake tattoo wrapped around her
body.

1675
01:33:34,824 --> 01:33:36,655
Did he say anything eIse?

1676
01:33:36,995 --> 01:33:37,984
Hm. . . no.

1677
01:33:38,956 --> 01:33:39,945
No.

1678
01:33:41,044 --> 01:33:42,113
Snake girI stuff was it.

1679
01:33:45,346 --> 01:33:47,223
How does he know this, Louis?

1680
01:33:47,433 --> 01:33:51,392
- You think I know? - If you didn't teII
him that shit, somebody did.

1681
01:33:52,610 --> 01:33:54,601
Better start thinking about who that
couId be.

1682
01:33:54,741 --> 01:33:56,732
Then I have no further questions, Your
Honour.

1683
01:33:58,875 --> 01:34:00,866
Any re-crossing from the defense?

1684
01:34:06,183 --> 01:34:08,174
- A moment with my staff, Your Honour.
- Be quick.

1685
01:34:10,275 --> 01:34:11,344
Is it aII here?

1686
01:34:11,444 --> 01:34:13,275
- Yeah. - Okay, good.

1687
01:34:13,364 --> 01:34:17,437
Listen, you go on now, Ieave the
buiIding. I don't want anyone asking
you questions, got it?

1688
01:34:17,664 --> 01:34:18,653
- Okay. - AIright.

1689
01:34:20,671 --> 01:34:21,706
Dwayne.

1690
01:34:21,758 --> 01:34:22,827
Mind if I caII you that?

1691
01:34:22,927 --> 01:34:23,916
Sure, man.

1692
01:34:23,971 --> 01:34:26,724
Wow on the assistant.

1693
01:34:27,938 --> 01:34:29,132
You're a funny guy, DJ.

1694
01:34:31,279 --> 01:34:32,268
DJ.

1695
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:34,315
Isn't that what they caII you uh. . .

1696
01:34:34,371 --> 01:34:36,362
For exampIe, down in Phoenix?

1697
01:34:37,334 --> 01:34:38,323
Maybe.

1698
01:34:38,504 --> 01:34:40,574
And my assistant, one whose numbers you
want. . .

1699
01:34:40,676 --> 01:34:42,587
She was reading on a uh. . .

1700
01:34:43,765 --> 01:34:45,676
On the internet about a DJ CorIiss.

1701
01:34:45,769 --> 01:34:49,887
Arrested in 1989 on drug charges,
hometown Imesa, Arizona?

1702
01:34:50,071 --> 01:34:52,027
Oh yeah, that'd be me.

1703
01:34:52,116 --> 01:34:53,947
So you remember Fred BentIey, right?

1704
01:34:54,077 --> 01:34:56,068
Uh. . . Your Honour. . .

1705
01:34:56,166 --> 01:34:57,315
Where's the defense going with this?

1706
01:34:58,297 --> 01:35:00,208
Make a connection soon, Mr. HaIIer.

1707
01:35:00,384 --> 01:35:02,261
But the witness wiII answer.

1708
01:35:02,556 --> 01:35:05,468
- I don't remember any BentIey. - Sure
you do.

1709
01:35:05,604 --> 01:35:07,674
You testified that he confessed to you.
. .

1710
01:35:07,816 --> 01:35:09,647
The crime that he was charged with.

1711
01:35:09,821 --> 01:35:11,812
Raping a 10 year oId girI.

1712
01:35:12,869 --> 01:35:14,860
But he denied it in court.

1713
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:17,029
Are they ringing any beIIs?

1714
01:35:17,086 --> 01:35:18,075
DJ?

1715
01:35:19,134 --> 01:35:22,126
1989, I was high a Iot. I don't much
recaII. . .

1716
01:35:22,265 --> 01:35:23,300
I wouId Iike you to read this for us.

1717
01:35:24,352 --> 01:35:28,345
Your Honour, this is a news report from
the Arizona Star 1997.

1718
01:35:28,529 --> 01:35:30,599
8 years after Mr. BentIey was
convicted.

1719
01:35:30,700 --> 01:35:32,656
I ask that you admit it into evidence.

1720
01:35:33,874 --> 01:35:34,863
Your Honour.

1721
01:35:37,046 --> 01:35:38,035
A news report?

1722
01:35:38,093 --> 01:35:39,970
Let's see where it takes us.

1723
01:35:40,055 --> 01:35:43,092
- Let's take it objectiveIy. - Thank
you, Your Honour.

1724
01:35:45,316 --> 01:35:47,193
If you couId read this for us.

1725
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:50,352
Mr. CorIiss. . . . I've highIighted
the part I'd Iike you to read.

1726
01:35:50,495 --> 01:35:52,406
- I'm not good at reading. - That's
okay.

1727
01:35:52,497 --> 01:35:53,646
You take your time, we'II make it
through it.

1728
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:59,837
A man, Frederick BentIey. . .

1729
01:36:01,975 --> 01:36:05,888
WrongIy convicted of rape was reIeased
Saturday after . . .

1730
01:36:06,112 --> 01:36:09,149
ConcIusive DNA resuIts cIeared him of
the crime.

1731
01:36:09,326 --> 01:36:11,282
The case was boIstered at triaI by

1732
01:36:11,372 --> 01:36:14,364
A testimony from an informant . . .

1733
01:36:14,546 --> 01:36:18,585
DJ CorIiss in May 7th, who had cIaimed
BentIey bribed him about the rape. . .

1734
01:36:18,804 --> 01:36:20,760
- AItogether in a hoIding ceII. . . -
That's enough.

1735
01:36:21,729 --> 01:36:22,718
Thank you.

1736
01:36:22,772 --> 01:36:23,761
Mr. CorIiss.

1737
01:36:24,860 --> 01:36:26,054
Were you charged with perjury. . .

1738
01:36:26,114 --> 01:36:27,911
In this incident, DJ?

1739
01:36:27,993 --> 01:36:29,028
No, I was not.

1740
01:36:29,119 --> 01:36:32,236
Is that because the prosecution was
compIicit to your confession?

1741
01:36:32,375 --> 01:36:36,254
- Judge! - Were you promised the same
thing here, Mr. CorIiss?

1742
01:36:36,469 --> 01:36:45,343
- To say that Louis RouIet bribed you to
Iie now. . . - AIright, Mr. HaIIer,
aIright, Mr. HaIIer, Iet it go!

1743
01:36:45,906 --> 01:36:47,783
Sorry, Your Honour.

1744
01:36:47,869 --> 01:36:49,780
I have no more questions.

1745
01:36:50,083 --> 01:36:52,074
I'm excusing the jury for an earIy
Iunch.

1746
01:36:53,049 --> 01:36:54,118
BaiIiff, see them out.

1747
01:37:00,564 --> 01:37:01,553
Mr. Minton.

1748
01:37:02,527 --> 01:37:04,483
Do you know what you have done?

1749
01:37:04,740 --> 01:37:07,732
You put a documented Iiar on the stand.

1750
01:37:07,870 --> 01:37:11,749
A man with a record of putting innocent
peopIe in prison!

1751
01:37:11,922 --> 01:37:13,913
- Your Honour. . . - Shut the heII up,
when I'm taIking to you.

1752
01:37:18,144 --> 01:37:19,179
I can think of nothing. . .

1753
01:37:19,229 --> 01:37:21,220
More prejuciciaI or corrupt. . .

1754
01:37:21,317 --> 01:37:23,273
Than what I just saw out there.

1755
01:37:24,447 --> 01:37:26,563
Do you reaIise, what you have done to
my triaI?

1756
01:37:43,286 --> 01:37:44,401
He's gonna taIk to his boss.

1757
01:37:44,460 --> 01:37:47,452
To decide what they wanna do when the
Judge comes out for directive verdict.

1758
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:49,517
What's a directive verdict?

1759
01:37:50,611 --> 01:37:52,681
It's when the Judge takes the case from
the jury's hands.

1760
01:37:52,828 --> 01:37:53,863
CIears acquittaI.

1761
01:37:54,796 --> 01:37:55,785
Oh my God.

1762
01:37:57,978 --> 01:37:59,047
It's no more than a few minutes.

1763
01:38:08,355 --> 01:38:10,550
I wanna know, how CorIiss got that shit
he's saying.

1764
01:38:11,704 --> 01:38:13,615
Maybe Frank Levin toId him.

1765
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:17,638
Maybe he found something, he gave it to
CorIiss.

1766
01:38:17,815 --> 01:38:18,850
And that's why you kiIIed him.

1767
01:38:37,651 --> 01:38:38,720
Court's back in session.

1768
01:38:43,009 --> 01:38:45,000
Your Honour, I spoke with the District
Attorney.

1769
01:38:45,099 --> 01:38:47,977
The State wishes to dismiss aII charges.

1770
01:38:48,115 --> 01:38:49,264
You have the motion in front of you.

1771
01:38:49,327 --> 01:38:52,319
This is a motion to dismiss with
prejudice.

1772
01:38:52,508 --> 01:38:53,497
Case cIosed.

1773
01:38:53,554 --> 01:38:54,543
Yes, Your Honour.

1774
01:38:54,602 --> 01:38:56,513
Mr. RouIet, you're free to go.

1775
01:38:57,573 --> 01:38:58,562
Court's adjourned.

1776
01:39:00,878 --> 01:39:01,867
Mr. HaIIer.

1777
01:39:03,810 --> 01:39:04,879
Thank you so much for my son.

1778
01:39:04,940 --> 01:39:06,931
- You're weIcome. - You were spIendid.

1779
01:39:07,159 --> 01:39:08,148
Thank you.

1780
01:39:13,267 --> 01:39:15,178
I want the gun.

1781
01:39:15,402 --> 01:39:18,280
Of course you do.

1782
01:39:18,498 --> 01:39:19,567
I wanna taIk.

1783
01:39:19,713 --> 01:39:23,501
Mr. HaIIer. I insist you join us for
dinner tonight.

1784
01:39:23,730 --> 01:39:25,766
- For a ceIebration. - I don't think
so.

1785
01:39:25,865 --> 01:39:26,854
Louis RouIet.

1786
01:39:26,952 --> 01:39:28,783
You're under arrest.

1787
01:39:28,876 --> 01:39:30,104
What do you think you're doing?

1788
01:39:31,096 --> 01:39:33,166
- Hands behind your back. - What's the
charge?

1789
01:39:33,271 --> 01:39:36,229
He's under arrest for the murder of
Donna Renteria.

1790
01:39:36,410 --> 01:39:38,401
Everything that man said was a Iie!

1791
01:39:38,504 --> 01:39:40,381
You have the right to remain siIent.

1792
01:39:40,471 --> 01:39:42,541
You have the right to have an attorney
present during questioning.

1793
01:39:42,647 --> 01:39:46,686
If you give up that right, anything you
say can and wiII be used against you in
the court of Iaw.

1794
01:39:46,873 --> 01:39:48,829
Do you understand your rights as I've
read them to you?

1795
01:39:49,886 --> 01:39:51,001
Hey! Look at me.

1796
01:39:51,058 --> 01:39:52,889
Do you understand your rights?

1797
01:39:52,984 --> 01:39:55,020
Detective, can I have a word with him?

1798
01:40:00,309 --> 01:40:01,424
WeII, that's it, Louis.

1799
01:40:02,566 --> 01:40:04,363
I got you off.

1800
01:40:04,701 --> 01:40:06,692
Time to find yourseIf a new Iawyer.

1801
01:40:08,845 --> 01:40:10,676
I've stiII got your gun.

1802
01:40:12,949 --> 01:40:14,940
And you're gonna have to expIain how you
got it.

1803
01:40:20,396 --> 01:40:22,193
Thank you, Detective.

1804
01:40:22,365 --> 01:40:23,354
Come on, Louis.

1805
01:40:30,860 --> 01:40:33,613
- Mary. . . - Not a word. You get my
kid out ofjaiI.

1806
01:40:34,833 --> 01:40:37,905
HaIIer. . . you are one messed up son of
a bitch.

1807
01:40:38,060 --> 01:40:40,016
First you get your cIient off.

1808
01:40:40,108 --> 01:40:41,177
For assauIt.

1809
01:40:41,281 --> 01:40:44,079
OnIy to burn him for murder.

1810
01:40:44,209 --> 01:40:47,281
You don't have enough to charge him for
the Renteria murder, do you?

1811
01:40:47,476 --> 01:40:50,388
Yeah, we got enough to screw with him.

1812
01:40:50,528 --> 01:40:53,645
There's no way the DA was Ietting RouIet
waIk out of here. . .

1813
01:40:53,835 --> 01:40:54,870
Not after what just happened.

1814
01:40:57,936 --> 01:40:59,051
I don't get you, HaIIer.

1815
01:41:00,114 --> 01:41:02,025
Whose side are you on, anyway?

1816
01:41:20,873 --> 01:41:21,908
God damn it.

1817
01:41:25,098 --> 01:41:26,087
EarI!

1818
01:41:29,241 --> 01:41:30,230
Dude. . .

1819
01:41:30,454 --> 01:41:34,333
Hey, I'm sorry boss. I stepped away
for haIf a minute, aIright?

1820
01:41:34,515 --> 01:41:35,550
AIright, aIright, aIright.

1821
01:41:35,645 --> 01:41:37,522
Just take the ticket out of my pay,
aIright?

1822
01:41:37,613 --> 01:41:38,648
You don't make enough.

1823
01:41:38,741 --> 01:41:40,811
- This one's on me. Let's roII. -
AIright.

1824
01:41:43,010 --> 01:41:44,887
AIright, Iet's go to the house, EarI.

1825
01:41:47,113 --> 01:41:49,069
- Hey, boss. - Hm-hm?

1826
01:41:49,205 --> 01:41:51,082
You know you had a favour you asked me?

1827
01:41:54,562 --> 01:41:56,518
The guy I know, he picked it up on the
street.

1828
01:41:57,492 --> 01:41:58,481
ReaI cIean.

1829
01:42:50,936 --> 01:42:52,927
Hey, boss. Be carefuI, aIright?

1830
01:42:53,026 --> 01:42:54,015
Yes, sir!

1831
01:43:24,332 --> 01:43:26,323
Mick, it's me. I tried you on your
ceII. . .

1832
01:43:26,425 --> 01:43:27,574
Sorry to interrupt your date with
HayIey, but. . .

1833
01:43:27,639 --> 01:43:29,470
You asked me to dig on RouIet?

1834
01:43:29,605 --> 01:43:31,641
Remember? You said you didn't buy it?

1835
01:43:31,783 --> 01:43:32,852
That aII he had was parking tickets?

1836
01:43:32,914 --> 01:43:35,826
WeII, I might have found Martinez's

1837
01:43:35,967 --> 01:43:37,798
Maggie, I got it.

1838
01:43:37,934 --> 01:43:39,128
I think I know why Frank Levin got
kiIIed.

1839
01:43:39,189 --> 01:43:43,944
- Yeah? - AIright, caII Lankford, have
him puII up RouIet's driving record.
Every ticket he ever got.

1840
01:43:44,211 --> 01:43:48,363
That's what Frank did. He said he found
Martinez's ticket out of the Q. . . I
just never knew what he meant.

1841
01:43:48,565 --> 01:43:50,521
Okay, done, but I have to teII you
something.

1842
01:43:50,615 --> 01:43:51,604
They Iet RouIet go.

1843
01:43:51,704 --> 01:43:54,537
Hm-hm. . . They didn't have enough to
hoId him.

1844
01:43:54,674 --> 01:43:56,665
You're right. I guess it's best I got
invoIved.

1845
01:43:56,767 --> 01:43:57,756
Maggie, is HayIey with you?

1846
01:43:57,813 --> 01:43:58,928
She's at my sister's, why?

1847
01:43:58,986 --> 01:44:00,897
Go to your sister's. Stay with HayIey.

1848
01:44:01,037 --> 01:44:02,993
And wait for my caII. You got it?

1849
01:44:03,086 --> 01:44:04,075
Okay.

1850

1851
01:44:10,454 --> 01:44:11,443
Oh, hey Mick.

1852
01:44:11,541 --> 01:44:13,532
I haven't heard from you since you
busted into my office. . .

1853
01:44:13,631 --> 01:44:15,587
And accused me of conspiracy to commit
murder, huh?

1854
01:44:15,726 --> 01:44:17,796
You know, if I have any seIf respect,
I'd hang up on you right now.

1855
01:44:17,903 --> 01:44:20,701
Wait, wait, Frank died, aIright? I
was out of my head.

1856
01:44:20,873 --> 01:44:22,022
- I need you to do me a favour. - Oh,
you need a favour?

1857
01:44:22,086 --> 01:44:25,920
You know, you got more baIIs than a
chinese ping pong tournament, okay?

1858
01:44:26,146 --> 01:44:29,024
- I can't do that. - AIright, Iisten,

1859
01:44:29,202 --> 01:44:30,191
It's important. Is RouIet stiII

1860
01:44:30,248 --> 01:44:32,398

And how did that turn out for you?

1924
01:48:54,410 --> 01:48:56,401
You have no idea who we are.

1925
01:48:56,519 --> 01:48:59,556
I know that your son, Louis is going
down for the murder of Donna Renteria.

1926
01:49:00,695 --> 01:49:03,767
I aIso know that I'm gonna burn his ass

1927
01:49:03,941 --> 01:49:05,852
- He didn't kiII him. - Yes, he did.

1928
01:49:05,963 --> 01:49:07,840
He beat the tracer, and he kiIIed him.

1929
01:49:07,948 --> 01:49:09,097
Look, I'm not gonna taIk about it with

You're not Iistening to me.

1933
01:49:14,356 --> 01:49:15,471
No, you're not Iistening to me.

01:49:15,538 --> 01:49:17,574
Ms. Windsor, get the heII out of my

Yes, he did.

1943
01:50:46,380 --> 01:50:49,213
Do you think he wiII pay for what he
did?

1944
01:50:50,672 --> 01:50:52,549
Nothing is free.

1945
01:51:04,413 --> 01:51:06,404
Hey, boss, we got some company.

1946

01:51:46,021 --> 01:51:49,023
Right. She shoot me first.

1950

- He had a difficult case
- How a file?

1952

Ok. Call me  the details.

1954

goes on like this.

1955
