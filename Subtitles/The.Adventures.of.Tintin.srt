1
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:57,949
Very nearly there, sir.

2
00:03:58,909 --> 00:04:01,949
I have to say, your face is familiar.
Have I drawn you before?

3
00:04:02,029 --> 00:04:03,029
Occasionally.

4
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:05,749
Of course! I've seen you in the newspaper.

5
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:08,549
- You're a reporter?
- I'm a journalist.

6
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:11,749
Be patient, Snowy, not much longer.

7
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:37,029
I do beg your pardon.

8
00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:48,429
There.

9
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:51,709
I believe I have captured something
of your likeness.

10
00:04:52,749 --> 00:04:54,029
Not bad!

11
00:04:54,589 --> 00:04:56,509
What do you think, Snowy?

12
00:04:58,189 --> 00:04:59,629
Snowy!

13
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:02,509
There you are, sir.

14
00:05:02,589 --> 00:05:04,869
Now where's he run off to?

15
00:05:07,869 --> 00:05:09,029
Anything?

16
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:10,269
Nothing.

17
00:05:14,909 --> 00:05:16,029
Snowy!

18
00:05:20,349 --> 00:05:22,669
Where have you been?

19
00:05:22,749 --> 00:05:24,429
Chasing cats again?

20
00:05:28,429 --> 00:05:30,589
Snowy, look at this!

21
00:05:43,549 --> 00:05:45,709
Triple masted.

22
00:05:45,789 --> 00:05:48,189
Double decks. Fifty guns.

23
00:05:49,269 --> 00:05:51,029
Isn't she a beauty?

24
00:05:51,109 --> 00:05:55,469
That's a very unique specimen, that is.
From an old sea captain's estate.

25
00:05:56,069 --> 00:05:57,069
"The Unicorn."

26
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:59,629
Unicorn. Man o'war sailing ship.

27
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:02,349
It's very old, that is. 16th century.

28
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:03,669
17th, I would think.

29
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:05,509
- Reign of Charles I.
- Charles II.

30
00:06:05,589 --> 00:06:09,229
That's what I said, Charles II.
As fine a ship as ever sailed the seven seas.

31
00:06:09,309 --> 00:06:10,989
You won't find another one of these, mate.

32
00:06:11,749 --> 00:06:13,349
And it's only two quid.

33
00:06:15,589 --> 00:06:17,829
- I'll give you a pound.
- Done!

34
00:06:22,029 --> 00:06:23,069
Gently does it.

35
00:06:24,029 --> 00:06:25,069
Excuse me!

36
00:06:25,149 --> 00:06:26,389
Here you go. Careful.

37
00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:30,029
Hey, bud, how much for the boat?

38
00:06:30,109 --> 00:06:32,149
I'm sorry, I just sold it to this young gent.

39
00:06:32,229 --> 00:06:33,309
Oh, yeah?

40
00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:35,629
Tell me what you paid
and I'll give you double.

41
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:38,829
- Double?
- Thanks. But it's not for sale.

42
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:41,629
Look, kid, I'm trying to help you out.

43
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:43,469
I don't think you realise this,

44
00:06:43,549 --> 00:06:45,789
but you're about to walk
into a whole mess of danger.

45
00:06:46,109 --> 00:06:47,269
What kind of danger?

46
00:06:48,549 --> 00:06:52,069
I'm warning you, get rid of the boat
and get out while you still can.

47
00:06:52,149 --> 00:06:54,509
These people do not play nice.

48
00:06:54,589 --> 00:06:55,709
What people?

49
00:06:55,789 --> 00:06:56,909
Wonderful!

50
00:06:57,949 --> 00:07:00,429
It's just wonderful.

51
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:04,549
Don't bother wrapping it, I'll take it as is.
Does anybody object if I pay by cheque?

52
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:07,669
If you want to buy it,
you'll have to talk to the kid.

53
00:07:07,749 --> 00:07:09,389
I see.

54
00:07:09,469 --> 00:07:12,549
Well, let the "kid" name his price.

55
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:14,229
"Name his price"?

56
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:17,229
Ten years I've been flogging bric-a-brac

57
00:07:17,309 --> 00:07:19,709
and I miss "name your price"
by one bleedin' minute!

58
00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:22,549
I'm sorry.
I already explained to the other gentleman.

59
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:25,549
American he was. All hair oil and no socks.

60
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:26,749
It's not for sale.

61
00:07:28,029 --> 00:07:31,149
Then let me appeal to your better nature.

62
00:07:31,229 --> 00:07:33,549
I have recently acquired Marlinspike Hall,

63
00:07:33,629 --> 00:07:37,549
and this ship, as I'm sure you're aware,
was once part of the estate.

64
00:07:37,629 --> 00:07:38,869
Of the late sea captain?

65
00:07:38,949 --> 00:07:42,029
The family fell upon hard times.
Lost everything.

66
00:07:42,109 --> 00:07:45,309
They've been living in a cloud
of bad luck ever since.

67
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:49,869
We are talking generations of drinking
and irrational behaviour...

68
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:51,269
I'm sorry.

69
00:07:51,349 --> 00:07:55,309
But as I told you before, it's not for sale.

70
00:07:55,389 --> 00:07:56,709
Good day to you, sir.

71
00:08:00,989 --> 00:08:03,469
That young man, what's his name?

72
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:06,949
Him? Everybody knows him. That's Tintin.

73
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:15,229
What is it about this ship?

74
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:18,989
Why has it attracted so much attention?

75
00:08:22,789 --> 00:08:24,709
What secrets do you hold?

76
00:08:33,109 --> 00:08:35,309
Where is that magnifying glass?

77
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:40,389
I could have sworn it was...

78
00:08:48,229 --> 00:08:49,989
Where could it possibly be?

79
00:08:51,429 --> 00:08:52,469
Snowy, you haven't seen the...

80
00:08:54,589 --> 00:08:55,909
Where is it?

81
00:09:00,589 --> 00:09:01,789
Thank you.

82
00:09:04,349 --> 00:09:05,749
No, Snowy!

83
00:09:24,229 --> 00:09:25,829
Look what you did.

84
00:09:26,669 --> 00:09:28,109
You broke it!

85
00:09:28,589 --> 00:09:29,789
Bad dog!

86
00:09:38,269 --> 00:09:40,509
Something happened on this ship.

87
00:09:41,229 --> 00:09:44,589
And we're going to the one place
that could have the answer.

88
00:09:44,669 --> 00:09:46,149
Come on, Snowy.

89
00:10:07,389 --> 00:10:08,389
Here it is.

90
00:10:09,469 --> 00:10:13,829
"Sir Francis Haddock of Marlinspike Hall,
the last captain of the ill-fated Unicorn.

91
00:10:13,909 --> 00:10:16,269
"The ship set sail from Barbados in 1676

92
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:19,669
"on one of the most ruinous voyages
in maritime history.

93
00:10:19,749 --> 00:10:21,389
"Ship never reached destination.

94
00:10:21,589 --> 00:10:25,589
"Attacked by pirates,
all hands lost except for one survivor.

95
00:10:25,669 --> 00:10:28,109
"When Sir Francis was rescued
and returned home,

96
00:10:28,189 --> 00:10:31,109
"he was convinced his name
had been cursed.

97
00:10:31,189 --> 00:10:32,509
"The Unicorn's manifest stated

98
00:10:32,589 --> 00:10:35,069
"that it was carrying a cargo of rum
and tobacco bound for Europe,

99
00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:39,309
"but it was long claimed
the ship was carrying a secret cargo."

100
00:10:40,829 --> 00:10:43,149
What was the ship carrying, Snowy?

101
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:49,549
"Historians have tried and failed to discover
what happened on that fatal voyage,

102
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:51,789
"but Sir Francis' last words,

103
00:10:52,989 --> 00:10:56,829
"'Only a true Haddock will discover
the secret of the Unicorn."'

104
00:11:21,309 --> 00:11:23,229
I've missed something, Snowy.

105
00:11:24,189 --> 00:11:26,109
We need to take a closer look at that model.

106
00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:40,029
Of course it's gone!

107
00:11:40,109 --> 00:11:42,029
How could I be so stupid?

108
00:12:03,669 --> 00:12:05,109
How'd you do that?

109
00:12:09,149 --> 00:12:10,429
Clever boy.

110
00:12:27,469 --> 00:12:29,229
A coat of arms.

111
00:12:29,869 --> 00:12:32,229
Why does that look familiar?

112
00:12:32,309 --> 00:12:33,869
Hang on a minute.

113
00:12:34,669 --> 00:12:36,309
That fish!

114
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:37,869
It's a haddock.

115
00:12:38,189 --> 00:12:41,869
Of course!
Marlinspike Hall is the old Haddock estate.

116
00:12:43,549 --> 00:12:44,669
Snowy!

117
00:13:11,229 --> 00:13:12,749
Well done, Snowy!

118
00:13:12,829 --> 00:13:14,069
Good boy.

119
00:14:06,229 --> 00:14:07,829
Well, well, well.

120
00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:10,829
It seems we've caught our thief.

121
00:14:20,349 --> 00:14:22,829
Welcome to Marlinspike Hall.

122
00:14:22,909 --> 00:14:25,029
I see you let yourself in.

123
00:14:25,109 --> 00:14:27,189
I came to retrieve my property.

124
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:29,709
I'm sorry, I'm not sure I follow you.

125
00:14:29,789 --> 00:14:31,149
I think you do.

126
00:14:31,229 --> 00:14:34,349
This ship was stolen from my apartment
less than an hour ago.

127
00:14:34,429 --> 00:14:36,989
I'm afraid you're mistaken, Mr. Tintin.

128
00:14:37,069 --> 00:14:39,149
There's no mistake. It belongs to me.

129
00:14:39,229 --> 00:14:40,629
Are you sure?

130
00:14:42,629 --> 00:14:44,029
Of course I'm sure.

131
00:14:44,109 --> 00:14:46,389
I took it home,
I put it on a cabinet in the living room,

132
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:49,669
and then Snowy chased the cat
and knocked it over, and it

133
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,509
fell.

134
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:55,109
This isn't my ship.

135
00:14:55,189 --> 00:14:56,789
No. Indeed.

136
00:14:58,149 --> 00:14:59,229
I'm sorry.

137
00:14:59,309 --> 00:15:02,589
- It looks identical.
- Well, looks can be deceiving.

138
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:05,549
Yes, indeed. But I don't understand!

139
00:15:06,549 --> 00:15:09,869
Why did Sir Francis make two ships
exactly alike?

140
00:15:09,949 --> 00:15:13,269
And you have one already.
Why do you want another?

141
00:15:14,269 --> 00:15:17,109
What is it about this model
that would cause someone to steal it?

142
00:15:17,189 --> 00:15:20,669
Goodness me, why so many questions?

143
00:15:20,749 --> 00:15:22,029
It's my job.

144
00:15:22,109 --> 00:15:24,949
There could be a story here.
That's what I do, you see.

145
00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:26,509
Well, it's no great mystery.

146
00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:29,389
Sir Francis Haddock was a drunkard
and a hopeless reprobate.

147
00:15:29,469 --> 00:15:33,829
He was doomed to fail,
and he bequeathed that failure to his sons.

148
00:15:34,549 --> 00:15:37,829
So it's true! The Haddock line is cursed.

149
00:15:39,629 --> 00:15:42,869
- What else have you found out?
- What is there to find?

150
00:15:44,189 --> 00:15:45,949
That depends what you're looking for.

151
00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:49,309
I'm looking for answers, Mr. Sakharine.

152
00:15:49,469 --> 00:15:51,789
You're looking in the wrong place.

153
00:15:52,549 --> 00:15:54,269
It's late.

154
00:15:54,349 --> 00:15:56,269
I think you should go home.

155
00:15:56,349 --> 00:15:57,789
This way, sir.

156
00:16:12,549 --> 00:16:13,869
It's a pity, sir.

157
00:16:14,749 --> 00:16:15,709
I'm sorry?

158
00:16:15,869 --> 00:16:18,109
That the mast broke on your model ship, sir.

159
00:16:18,429 --> 00:16:20,829
I hope you found all the pieces.

160
00:16:20,909 --> 00:16:22,389
Things are so easily lost.

161
00:16:22,469 --> 00:16:24,829
Nestor! Where are you?

162
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:27,069
Good night, sir.

163
00:16:31,229 --> 00:16:33,269
Some things are easily lost.

164
00:16:34,789 --> 00:16:37,029
What did he mean by that, Snowy?

165
00:16:37,109 --> 00:16:39,629
What was he trying to tell me?

166
00:16:39,709 --> 00:16:41,789
Some things are easily lost.

167
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:49,669
Snowy!

168
00:16:55,549 --> 00:16:56,949
Great snakes!

169
00:17:03,869 --> 00:17:05,469
What is it, Snowy?

170
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:24,229
What's this?

171
00:17:26,229 --> 00:17:27,949
This was in the mast!

172
00:17:34,669 --> 00:17:36,189
Good boy, Snowy.

173
00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:42,389
"Three brothers joined.

174
00:17:42,469 --> 00:17:44,949
"Three Unicorns in company

175
00:17:45,229 --> 00:17:48,029
"sailing in the noonday sun will speak.

176
00:17:48,349 --> 00:17:51,749
"For 'tis from the light that light will dawn.

177
00:17:51,829 --> 00:17:54,549
"And then shines forth the Eagle's Cross."

178
00:17:57,189 --> 00:17:58,869
What are these markings?

179
00:17:59,069 --> 00:18:02,509
Some kind of secret language or code?

180
00:18:02,629 --> 00:18:04,589
It makes no sense.

181
00:18:04,669 --> 00:18:07,149
But it does explain
why they ransacked the flat.

182
00:18:07,229 --> 00:18:09,869
They were looking for this,
and they didn't find it.

183
00:18:10,309 --> 00:18:11,669
Which means

184
00:18:13,669 --> 00:18:14,869
they'll be back.

185
00:18:16,309 --> 00:18:19,389
No, I don't know where he is, dearie.
I think he's gone out.

186
00:18:19,469 --> 00:18:21,229
And anyway, it's after dark,

187
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:26,029
and Mr. Tintin is most particular
about not admitting visitors after bedtime.

188
00:18:26,589 --> 00:18:28,549
I have to go back to my cocoa.

189
00:18:28,669 --> 00:18:31,549
I've got a very good book and a cup of cocoa.

190
00:18:31,629 --> 00:18:33,389
It's really lovely!

191
00:18:33,469 --> 00:18:36,349
Thank you, Mrs. Finch. I can look after this.

192
00:18:39,469 --> 00:18:42,669
Hey, kid, is that you? Open the door.

193
00:18:43,349 --> 00:18:44,389
What do you want?

194
00:18:44,469 --> 00:18:48,069
Look, the game is up. He's gonna be back.

195
00:18:48,149 --> 00:18:50,509
Now, I know he wanted those boats,
but I swear to God,

196
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:52,349
I never thought he'd kill anyone over it!

197
00:18:52,469 --> 00:18:54,829
Who? Who are you talking about?

198
00:18:54,909 --> 00:18:57,269
I'm trying to tell you
that your life is in danger.

199
00:18:57,349 --> 00:18:58,309
Answer me! Who?

200
00:19:17,949 --> 00:19:21,709
Mrs. Finch!
A man's been shot on our doorstep!

201
00:19:21,789 --> 00:19:24,229
- Not again.
- Call an ambulance!

202
00:19:27,629 --> 00:19:28,909
No, Snowy!

203
00:19:42,189 --> 00:19:43,549
Can you hear me?

204
00:19:43,629 --> 00:19:44,909
Can you...

205
00:19:53,749 --> 00:19:56,229
The victim's name was Barnaby Dawes.

206
00:19:56,309 --> 00:19:58,669
He was one of the top agents at Interpol,

207
00:19:58,749 --> 00:20:00,749
but we haven't got a clue
what he was working on.

208
00:20:00,829 --> 00:20:03,349
Quite right, Thompson.
We're completely clueless.

209
00:20:03,429 --> 00:20:04,989
Interpol doesn't have any other leads?

210
00:20:05,069 --> 00:20:07,549
Steady on, Tintin.
We're still filling out the paperwork.

211
00:20:07,629 --> 00:20:11,029
Police work's not all glamour and guns.
There's an awful lot of filing.

212
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:12,549
Well, I might have something for you.

213
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:14,989
Before he lost consciousness,
Dawes tried to tell me something,

214
00:20:15,069 --> 00:20:16,989
and I think he was spelling out a word.

215
00:20:17,109 --> 00:20:19,029
"...B- O-U

216
00:20:19,629 --> 00:20:22,189
"D-J-A-N.

217
00:20:24,429 --> 00:20:25,749
"Karaboudjan."

218
00:20:25,829 --> 00:20:27,189
Karaboudjan!

219
00:20:27,829 --> 00:20:28,949
Does that mean anything to you?

220
00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:31,149
Great Scotland Yard! That's extraordinary!

221
00:20:31,229 --> 00:20:32,189
What is?

222
00:20:32,269 --> 00:20:34,549
Worthington's have a half-price sale
on bowler hats!

223
00:20:34,629 --> 00:20:37,349
Really, Thomson! This is hardly the time.

224
00:20:37,429 --> 00:20:39,349
- Great Scotland Yard!
- What is it?

225
00:20:39,429 --> 00:20:40,429
Canes are half-price, too!

226
00:20:40,509 --> 00:20:42,029
Are you going to take charge
of this evidence?

227
00:20:42,109 --> 00:20:43,229
Positively.

228
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:46,349
Never fear, Tintin,
the evidence is safe with us!

229
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:49,789
Thomson? Where are you?

230
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:53,029
Well, I'm already downstairs.
Do try to keep up.

231
00:20:54,989 --> 00:20:56,989
Wait! You dropped this.

232
00:20:57,069 --> 00:20:59,789
Good heavens, Thomson!
Look after the evidence, man.

233
00:20:59,869 --> 00:21:02,189
Sorry, Thompson.
My mind is on other things.

234
00:21:02,269 --> 00:21:04,989
Yes. Our light-fingered larcenist.

235
00:21:05,469 --> 00:21:06,789
- What?
- The pickpocket.

236
00:21:06,869 --> 00:21:09,309
He has no idea what's coming.

237
00:21:09,389 --> 00:21:11,949
Go on, Tintin, take my wallet.

238
00:21:15,229 --> 00:21:17,709
Yes, industrial strength elastic.

239
00:21:17,789 --> 00:21:19,469
Very resourceful.

240
00:21:19,549 --> 00:21:23,149
On the contrary. It was childishly simple.

241
00:21:23,229 --> 00:21:24,909
Simply childish, I agree.

242
00:21:24,989 --> 00:21:26,029
- Tintin.
- Tintin.

243
00:21:26,109 --> 00:21:27,389
Gentlemen.

244
00:21:28,909 --> 00:21:31,309
Mind you, I expect he's miles away by now.

245
00:21:31,389 --> 00:21:33,269
I presume you're referring to the pickpocket?

246
00:21:33,349 --> 00:21:36,669
Yes. I mean,
knowing we're just a few steps behind him.

247
00:21:37,309 --> 00:21:39,869
Snowy, what is it, boy? What do you see?

248
00:21:39,949 --> 00:21:41,709
I don't suppose you'd fancy a cup of tea?

249
00:21:41,789 --> 00:21:43,869
You're quite mistaken. I'd love one.

250
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:45,309
My treat.

251
00:21:47,469 --> 00:21:49,429
- I've got you now!
- You devil!

252
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:51,869
Stop, in the name of the law!

253
00:21:53,469 --> 00:21:54,509
Got you!

254
00:21:58,269 --> 00:22:00,269
What's going on down there?

255
00:22:00,349 --> 00:22:01,429
Come on, Snowy!

256
00:22:03,109 --> 00:22:05,389
- I do beg your pardon.
- Sorry, sir!

257
00:22:05,469 --> 00:22:08,909
The pickpocket, Tintin! He's getting away!

258
00:22:08,989 --> 00:22:10,949
My wallet!

259
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:12,309
It's gone!

260
00:22:14,829 --> 00:22:17,069
Come on! Snowy, after him!

261
00:22:17,149 --> 00:22:18,469
Stop! Wait!

262
00:22:30,909 --> 00:22:33,509
- Got you!
- Steady on.

263
00:22:33,589 --> 00:22:35,549
I've lost him!

264
00:22:35,629 --> 00:22:38,509
You must find my wallet.
It's very important. I have to get it back.

265
00:22:38,589 --> 00:22:41,989
And you will. Leave it to the professionals.

266
00:22:43,709 --> 00:22:45,469
We've lost the scroll.

267
00:22:45,549 --> 00:22:47,789
But we haven't lost the story.

268
00:22:47,869 --> 00:22:49,309
"Karaboudjan."

269
00:22:49,389 --> 00:22:51,469
It's an Armenian word.
That's our lead, Snowy.

270
00:22:51,549 --> 00:22:54,549
What was Barnaby Dawes trying to tell us
when he said our lives were in danger?

271
00:22:54,629 --> 00:22:56,989
- Mr. Tin... Tin?
- Yes.

272
00:22:57,069 --> 00:22:59,469
- Delivery for you.
- But I didn't order anything.

273
00:22:59,549 --> 00:23:02,869
Well, that's because it's you
that's getting delivered!

274
00:23:06,109 --> 00:23:08,069
Quick, get him in the van!

275
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:12,989
Get off me, you confounded mutt!

276
00:23:13,949 --> 00:23:15,469
He bit me!

277
00:23:15,549 --> 00:23:16,669
Quick!

278
00:23:44,669 --> 00:23:46,029
Get him off!

279
00:23:47,829 --> 00:23:49,949
Shake him off, then run him over!

280
00:24:33,149 --> 00:24:35,109
I want this on the starboard side!

281
00:24:42,349 --> 00:24:44,269
Not here. Look your side.

282
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:45,549
Hang on.

283
00:24:45,629 --> 00:24:47,149
- Nothing.
- Well, check that pocket, Tom.

284
00:24:47,229 --> 00:24:49,069
No, I've looked in this one already,
I'm sure of it.

285
00:24:49,149 --> 00:24:50,269
Well, have a look in his socks.

286
00:24:53,069 --> 00:24:55,069
- Have you found it?
- He doesn't have it.

287
00:24:55,149 --> 00:24:56,389
It's not on him, boss. It's not here.

288
00:24:56,469 --> 00:24:58,709
- Not here? Then where is it?
- Where's what?

289
00:24:59,549 --> 00:25:02,749
I am tired of your games.
The scroll, from the Unicorn.

290
00:25:02,869 --> 00:25:05,829
A piece of paper like this!

291
00:25:05,909 --> 00:25:07,389
You mean the poem?

292
00:25:08,069 --> 00:25:09,669
Yes.

293
00:25:09,749 --> 00:25:13,069
- The poem written in Old English.
- Yes.

294
00:25:13,149 --> 00:25:15,349
- It was inside a cylinder.
- Yes.

295
00:25:15,429 --> 00:25:17,789
- Concealed in the mast.
- Yes!

296
00:25:19,189 --> 00:25:20,189
I don't have it.

297
00:25:22,429 --> 00:25:26,709
You know the value of that scroll.
Why else would you take it?

298
00:25:26,789 --> 00:25:30,509
Two ships and two scrolls,
both part of a puzzle.

299
00:25:30,589 --> 00:25:33,189
You have one, you need the other.

300
00:25:33,269 --> 00:25:36,469
But that's not it. There's something else.

301
00:25:37,509 --> 00:25:41,189
I will find it, with or without your help.

302
00:25:42,789 --> 00:25:45,909
You need to think about
exactly how useful you are to me.

303
00:25:50,269 --> 00:25:52,709
- We'll deal with him on the way.
- Aye-aye, sir.

304
00:25:52,789 --> 00:25:54,349
Hold this course.

305
00:26:01,149 --> 00:26:02,269
Snowy!

306
00:26:03,869 --> 00:26:07,229
It's good to see you, too.
See if you can chew through these ropes.

307
00:26:11,789 --> 00:26:15,709
He's lying! He must have the scroll.
The question is, what has he done with it?

308
00:26:15,789 --> 00:26:17,469
We searched him all over, boss.

309
00:26:17,549 --> 00:26:20,189
I want you to go back down there
and make him talk.

310
00:26:20,269 --> 00:26:22,949
Break every bone in his body if you have to!

311
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:24,069
That's nasty.

312
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:26,989
You know the stakes.
You know what we're playing for. Just do it!

313
00:26:27,069 --> 00:26:30,029
Mr. Sakharine! Mr. Sakharine!
All hell has broken loose!

314
00:26:30,109 --> 00:26:32,069
It's a disaster! The captain has come around.

315
00:26:32,149 --> 00:26:33,709
- What?
- He's conscious.

316
00:26:33,789 --> 00:26:35,589
He's accusing you of mutiny.

317
00:26:35,669 --> 00:26:39,069
- He says you turned the crew against him.
- Sounds like he's sobered up again.

318
00:26:39,149 --> 00:26:41,629
Well, don't just stand there.
Get him another bottle.

319
00:26:42,229 --> 00:26:43,229
Aye, sir!

320
00:26:52,349 --> 00:26:53,509
Okay.

321
00:27:10,589 --> 00:27:12,109
- Jiggle it a bit, it's just stuck.
- Jiggle?

322
00:27:12,189 --> 00:27:13,309
Here.

323
00:27:15,189 --> 00:27:17,949
What are you doing? Get off!

324
00:27:18,029 --> 00:27:21,189
It's not stuck, you idiot.
He's bolted it from the inside!

325
00:27:21,269 --> 00:27:23,829
So you want to play like that then,
do you, Tintin?

326
00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:25,269
Get the TNT.

327
00:27:26,629 --> 00:27:29,909
Broken crates. Rope. Champagne.

328
00:27:31,029 --> 00:27:32,189
What else do we have, Snowy?

329
00:27:32,829 --> 00:27:35,229
There are other ways to open this door.

330
00:27:35,909 --> 00:27:38,629
They'll be swabbing the decks
with your innards when we're done with you.

331
00:27:43,389 --> 00:27:44,869
Give it here.

332
00:28:08,509 --> 00:28:10,229
- Don't move.
- What...

333
00:28:15,989 --> 00:28:17,269
Let's go!

334
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,669
Let me have him!

335
00:28:19,749 --> 00:28:21,749
He's got a big shooter!

336
00:28:22,109 --> 00:28:23,389
He got me!

337
00:28:28,029 --> 00:28:29,349
Hold your fire.

338
00:28:36,189 --> 00:28:38,589
He ain't here. He's vanished.

339
00:28:40,669 --> 00:28:41,829
He's hiding.

340
00:28:41,909 --> 00:28:44,029
Search the ship. Quickly!

341
00:28:54,989 --> 00:28:57,229
A giant rat of Sumatra!

342
00:28:59,309 --> 00:29:01,149
So, you thought you could
sneak in behind me

343
00:29:01,229 --> 00:29:03,789
and catch me with my trousers down, huh?

344
00:29:03,869 --> 00:29:05,869
I'd rather you kept your trousers on,
if it's all the same to you.

345
00:29:05,949 --> 00:29:08,789
- I know your game. You're one of them.
- Sorry?

346
00:29:08,869 --> 00:29:11,429
- They sent you here to kill me, huh?
- Look, I don't know who you are!

347
00:29:11,509 --> 00:29:13,189
That's how he's planned to bump me off.

348
00:29:13,749 --> 00:29:16,509
Murdered in my bed
by a baby-faced assassin!

349
00:29:18,109 --> 00:29:20,189
Assassin? Look, you've got it all wrong.

350
00:29:20,269 --> 00:29:22,669
I was kidnapped by a gang of thugs.

351
00:29:24,549 --> 00:29:26,309
The filthy swine.

352
00:29:27,189 --> 00:29:29,349
He's turned the whole crew against me!

353
00:29:29,429 --> 00:29:30,629
Who?

354
00:29:30,709 --> 00:29:32,869
A sour-faced man with a sugary name.

355
00:29:32,949 --> 00:29:35,629
He's bought them all off, every last man.

356
00:29:35,709 --> 00:29:36,749
Sakharine!

357
00:29:37,429 --> 00:29:40,909
Nobody takes my ship!

358
00:29:40,989 --> 00:29:41,989
You're the captain?

359
00:29:42,069 --> 00:29:45,149
Of course I'm the captain.
Who else could I be?

360
00:29:45,229 --> 00:29:48,389
I've been locked in this room for days

361
00:29:48,469 --> 00:29:53,109
with only whisky to sustain my mortal soul.

362
00:29:58,909 --> 00:30:00,469
Well, I assumed it was locked.

363
00:30:00,629 --> 00:30:01,989
Well, it's not.

364
00:30:02,069 --> 00:30:05,029
Now, you must excuse me.
If they find me here, they'll kill me.

365
00:30:05,109 --> 00:30:09,069
I have to keep moving.
Try and find my way off this drunken tub.

366
00:30:09,149 --> 00:30:10,829
"Tub"? Tub?

367
00:30:15,909 --> 00:30:20,829
Tub?

368
00:30:25,109 --> 00:30:26,709
- Thanks.
- Pleasure.

369
00:30:28,629 --> 00:30:30,029
I'm Tintin, by the way.

370
00:30:30,109 --> 00:30:32,309
Haddock. Archibald Haddock.

371
00:30:32,389 --> 00:30:34,629
There's a longboat up on deck. Follow me.

372
00:30:34,709 --> 00:30:35,989
Hang on a second.

373
00:30:36,069 --> 00:30:37,349
Did you say "Haddock"?

374
00:30:38,309 --> 00:30:40,309
How could you let them escape?

375
00:30:40,389 --> 00:30:42,789
Find them. Find them both.

376
00:30:42,869 --> 00:30:45,189
- Don't worry, we'll kill them, sir.
- No.

377
00:30:45,269 --> 00:30:47,789
You can kill the boy. Not Haddock.

378
00:30:47,869 --> 00:30:50,029
What? He's just a hopeless old soak.

379
00:30:50,109 --> 00:30:52,229
We should've killed him long since.

380
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:56,949
You think it's an accident
that I chose Haddock's ship, Haddock's crew,

381
00:30:57,029 --> 00:30:59,549
Haddock's treacherous first mate?

382
00:31:00,349 --> 00:31:02,509
Nothing is an accident.

383
00:31:08,429 --> 00:31:11,949
We go back a long way,
Captain Haddock and I.

384
00:31:12,029 --> 00:31:14,789
We've unfinished business.

385
00:31:14,869 --> 00:31:18,829
And this time, I'm going to make him pay.

386
00:31:19,749 --> 00:31:23,749
We have to reach a locked door at the end
of this corridor. This is gonna be tricky.

387
00:31:23,829 --> 00:31:25,069
You wouldn't happen to be related

388
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:26,869
to the Haddocks of Marlinspike Hall,
would you?

389
00:31:27,309 --> 00:31:28,269
Why do you ask?

390
00:31:28,349 --> 00:31:29,749
It's for a story I've been working on.

391
00:31:29,829 --> 00:31:32,389
An old shipwreck that happened
off the coast of Barbados.

392
00:31:32,469 --> 00:31:35,109
A man o'war. Triple masted. Fifty guns.

393
00:31:37,589 --> 00:31:41,469
- What do you know of the Unicorn?
- Not a lot. That's why I'm asking you.

394
00:31:41,549 --> 00:31:44,869
The secret of that ship
is known only to my family!

395
00:31:44,949 --> 00:31:47,789
It's been passed down
from generation to generation.

396
00:31:47,869 --> 00:31:52,509
My granddaddy himself,
with his dying breath, told me the tale.

397
00:31:53,309 --> 00:31:54,389
And?

398
00:31:55,069 --> 00:31:56,149
Gone.

399
00:31:56,949 --> 00:31:58,029
What do you mean, gone?

400
00:31:58,109 --> 00:32:01,389
I was so upset when he kicked the bucket,
I had no choice but to drown my sorrows.

401
00:32:01,469 --> 00:32:04,869
When I woke up in the morning, it was gone!
I'd forgotten it all.

402
00:32:04,949 --> 00:32:06,629
- Everything?
- Every last word.

403
00:32:06,709 --> 00:32:09,669
Well, is there somebody else in your family?
Maybe they would know.

404
00:32:09,749 --> 00:32:12,869
Sir Francis had three sons.
All but my bloodline failed.

405
00:32:12,949 --> 00:32:15,949
I am the last of the Haddocks!

406
00:32:16,029 --> 00:32:17,629
Did you say three sons?

407
00:32:18,189 --> 00:32:19,589
Let's check below!

408
00:32:20,029 --> 00:32:22,349
There is a bottle of rum for the man
who finds Haddock.

409
00:32:22,429 --> 00:32:25,229
And kill the boy. Hope I find him first.

410
00:32:25,309 --> 00:32:26,669
What's that?

411
00:32:27,429 --> 00:32:28,749
You're hearing things.

412
00:32:28,829 --> 00:32:30,109
Quiet, Ali.

413
00:32:32,589 --> 00:32:34,029
There's nothing there.

414
00:32:34,349 --> 00:32:35,709
Let's go up.

415
00:32:36,669 --> 00:32:38,189
I know what Sakharine's looking for.

416
00:32:38,269 --> 00:32:41,869
- What are you raving on about?
- It was written on the scroll.

417
00:32:41,949 --> 00:32:43,749
"Three brothers joined.

418
00:32:43,869 --> 00:32:47,109
"Three Unicorns in company
sailing in the noonday sun will speak."

419
00:32:47,189 --> 00:32:48,189
Really?

420
00:32:48,509 --> 00:32:51,669
Sir Francis didn't make two models
of the Unicorn.

421
00:32:51,749 --> 00:32:52,909
He made three!

422
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:56,469
Three ships for three sons.

423
00:32:56,549 --> 00:32:57,629
Excellent!

424
00:32:59,549 --> 00:33:02,149
Sakharine's after the third model ship.

425
00:33:03,709 --> 00:33:05,829
Barnacles! Someone's locked the door!

426
00:33:05,909 --> 00:33:08,029
- Well, is there a key?
- A key?

427
00:33:11,029 --> 00:33:13,949
Yes, now, that would be the problem.

428
00:33:19,389 --> 00:33:20,469
Mr. Jaggerman!

429
00:33:20,989 --> 00:33:24,069
Top bunk in the centre. Keeper of the keys.

430
00:33:24,149 --> 00:33:28,709
Careful, mind. He's a restless sleeper
on account of the tragic loss of his eyelids.

431
00:33:28,789 --> 00:33:30,509
- He lost his eyelids?
- Aye.

432
00:33:30,589 --> 00:33:33,309
Now, that was a card game to remember.

433
00:33:33,949 --> 00:33:36,549
You really had to be there.

434
00:33:36,629 --> 00:33:37,949
I'd do this myself, Tintin,

435
00:33:38,029 --> 00:33:41,549
but you've a lighter tread
and less chance of waking the boys.

436
00:33:41,629 --> 00:33:45,509
- Are you sure this is a good idea?
- You've nothing to worry about.

437
00:33:45,749 --> 00:33:47,709
Provided they all stay asleep.

438
00:33:48,509 --> 00:33:50,749
I wouldn't get too close to Mr. Hobbs.

439
00:33:51,149 --> 00:33:52,989
He's very handy with a razor.

440
00:33:55,789 --> 00:33:58,829
And I'd steer clear of Mr. Gitch.

441
00:34:01,549 --> 00:34:05,469
Sacked as a shepherd
on account of his "animal husbandry."

442
00:34:31,549 --> 00:34:33,069
Not the sandwich.

443
00:34:33,149 --> 00:34:34,389
The keys!

444
00:34:53,269 --> 00:34:55,029
You're a brave lad, Tintin.

445
00:34:55,149 --> 00:34:57,589
My heart was in my mouth,
I don't mind telling you.

446
00:34:57,669 --> 00:35:01,749
Well, that is, if it was my heart.

447
00:35:01,829 --> 00:35:03,589
Judging by my stomach,
it could've been anything, really.

448
00:35:03,669 --> 00:35:05,629
Hurry up, Captain! We've no time to lose.

449
00:35:06,109 --> 00:35:07,549
Bingo!

450
00:35:08,269 --> 00:35:09,749
Just the necessities, of course.

451
00:35:16,509 --> 00:35:18,069
To the lifeboats.

452
00:35:18,629 --> 00:35:19,949
Ease it in!

453
00:35:22,349 --> 00:35:23,469
Put your back into it!

454
00:35:23,549 --> 00:35:25,589
Hold her there, steady!

455
00:35:25,669 --> 00:35:26,949
Any sign of him, Jumbo?

456
00:35:27,069 --> 00:35:30,749
Nothing yet. Watch yourself.
The boss says he's a handful.

457
00:35:42,109 --> 00:35:43,309
Come on.

458
00:36:02,709 --> 00:36:04,069
It's Allan.

459
00:36:04,149 --> 00:36:07,949
- Is that the bridge?
- Aye, on the other side of the radio room.

460
00:36:08,029 --> 00:36:09,829
Radio room?

461
00:36:09,909 --> 00:36:12,909
Wait here, Captain.
Sound the alarm if anyone comes.

462
00:36:12,989 --> 00:36:14,549
Careful, Tintin.

463
00:36:16,829 --> 00:36:18,069
I can't see a thing!

464
00:36:18,149 --> 00:36:20,909
Quit your whining and find the kid!

465
00:36:20,989 --> 00:36:22,629
I didn't sign on for this!

466
00:36:22,709 --> 00:36:23,909
Keep searching!

467
00:36:24,269 --> 00:36:26,469
- Message just come through, boss.
- What's it say?

468
00:36:26,549 --> 00:36:31,589
"The Milanese Nightingale has landed.
Waiting in the wings for action."

469
00:36:31,669 --> 00:36:33,429
"Milanese Nightingale"?

470
00:36:33,509 --> 00:36:35,269
Now pray this cheers him up.

471
00:36:51,069 --> 00:36:52,269
"Bagghar."

472
00:36:53,629 --> 00:36:54,749
What's this?

473
00:36:55,509 --> 00:36:57,549
"The Sultanate of Bagghar

474
00:37:00,029 --> 00:37:02,429
"ruled over by Sheikh Omar Ben Salaad,

475
00:37:02,909 --> 00:37:06,549
"whose love of music and culture
is matched only by his love of..."

476
00:37:08,829 --> 00:37:09,789
Great snakes!

477
00:37:15,389 --> 00:37:16,549
Bagghar.

478
00:37:19,229 --> 00:37:21,389
The Port of Bagghar.

479
00:37:21,469 --> 00:37:22,749
Morocco.

480
00:37:30,669 --> 00:37:31,949
Tintin!

481
00:37:34,229 --> 00:37:36,229
Hey! Put your hands up!

482
00:37:40,509 --> 00:37:42,389
And let that be a lesson to you!

483
00:37:43,149 --> 00:37:44,509
Help me!

484
00:37:53,789 --> 00:37:55,189
In here! He's in here!

485
00:37:59,829 --> 00:38:01,269
Here! By the lifeboats!

486
00:38:01,349 --> 00:38:02,789
Out of the way!

487
00:38:02,869 --> 00:38:04,669
After him! Get him!

488
00:38:12,109 --> 00:38:13,989
Quick, quick, in here!

489
00:38:18,549 --> 00:38:19,789
Over there!

490
00:38:20,509 --> 00:38:22,109
Why, you little...

491
00:38:40,549 --> 00:38:42,349
- He's up there!
- Go!

492
00:38:46,789 --> 00:38:48,509
I can see him now!

493
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:55,869
Don't let them get away!

494
00:39:00,269 --> 00:39:01,669
Help me!

495
00:39:07,869 --> 00:39:09,389
- Turn this ship around!
- Aye, sir!

496
00:39:09,469 --> 00:39:10,949
Get me a flare!

497
00:39:16,629 --> 00:39:18,669
Captain, get down! Get down!

498
00:39:21,469 --> 00:39:23,749
- There he is!
- Get out of the way!

499
00:39:27,909 --> 00:39:30,429
Now! Full ahead! Full speed!

500
00:39:36,029 --> 00:39:37,509
Got you now.

501
00:39:38,669 --> 00:39:40,149
Stay down.

502
00:39:50,869 --> 00:39:51,869
Look! Down there!

503
00:40:04,189 --> 00:40:06,709
Idiots! You idiots! What have you done?

504
00:40:06,789 --> 00:40:08,829
We killed them, boss, like you wanted!

505
00:40:08,909 --> 00:40:13,269
No! Not like I wanted!
I needed Haddock alive!

506
00:40:13,349 --> 00:40:16,349
Wait a minute, boss!
There are two boats missing!

507
00:40:16,669 --> 00:40:19,269
So, that one must have been a decoy.

508
00:40:27,349 --> 00:40:30,469
They're onto us, and our destination.

509
00:40:30,549 --> 00:40:34,749
Find them! Make absolutely certain
they never reach Bagghar!

510
00:40:35,109 --> 00:40:37,829
Yes, boss.

511
00:40:40,109 --> 00:40:42,829
Get up there!

512
00:40:50,029 --> 00:40:51,829
We have to get to Bagghar
ahead of Sakharine.

513
00:40:51,909 --> 00:40:53,389
I know. I know.

514
00:40:54,149 --> 00:40:55,189
Why?

515
00:40:55,389 --> 00:40:57,549
Because he has the third model ship.

516
00:40:57,629 --> 00:40:59,189
How do you know?

517
00:41:00,109 --> 00:41:03,069
The Sheikh collects old ships. And this

518
00:41:03,709 --> 00:41:05,949
is the prize of his collection.

519
00:41:07,309 --> 00:41:10,349
Blistering blue barnacles,
that is the Unicorn!

520
00:41:10,429 --> 00:41:12,269
Captain, do you see the distortion
around the model?

521
00:41:12,349 --> 00:41:13,349
Aye.

522
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:17,269
It means that Ben Salaad exhibits it
in a bulletproof glass case in his palace.

523
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:19,949
And Sakharine is going there to steal it!

524
00:41:20,029 --> 00:41:22,509
Yes, he has a secret weapon.
The Milanese Nightingale.

525
00:41:22,589 --> 00:41:24,069
But that won't be enough
to solve the mystery,

526
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:27,349
and that is why Sakharine needs you.

527
00:41:27,429 --> 00:41:28,709
That's why he made you his prisoner.

528
00:41:29,029 --> 00:41:31,829
There is something
he needs you to remember.

529
00:41:33,749 --> 00:41:35,109
I don't follow you.

530
00:41:36,549 --> 00:41:37,789
I read it in a book.

531
00:41:38,749 --> 00:41:42,229
That only a true Haddock
can discover the secret of the Unicorn.

532
00:41:47,909 --> 00:41:49,709
I don't remember anything about anything.

533
00:41:49,789 --> 00:41:52,509
But you must know about your ancestors,
Sir Francis. It's your family legacy!

534
00:41:52,589 --> 00:41:53,949
My memory is not what it used to be.

535
00:41:54,029 --> 00:41:56,629
- Well, what did it used to be?
- I've forgotten.

536
00:41:58,029 --> 00:41:59,029
Captain,

537
00:41:59,909 --> 00:42:01,109
can you get us to Bagghar?

538
00:42:02,109 --> 00:42:04,869
What sort of a stupid question is that?

539
00:42:05,629 --> 00:42:09,549
Give me those oars!
I'll show you some real seamanship, laddie.

540
00:42:09,629 --> 00:42:15,109
I'll not be doubted by some pipsqueak tuft
of ginger and his irritating dog!

541
00:42:15,189 --> 00:42:19,069
I am master and commander of the seas!

542
00:42:20,669 --> 00:42:24,349
I know these waters better than the warts
on my mother's face!

543
00:42:26,749 --> 00:42:29,389
Look at the pair of them. Fast asleep.

544
00:42:29,909 --> 00:42:33,709
Typical landlubbers.
Aye, no stamina these days.

545
00:42:33,789 --> 00:42:37,269
Never mind. I'll get you there, Tintin.

546
00:42:53,149 --> 00:42:55,229
Look, Thomson. There's the fellow.

547
00:42:57,109 --> 00:42:58,229
Oh, my.

548
00:43:07,829 --> 00:43:10,189
- Mr. Silk?
- Yes?

549
00:43:10,269 --> 00:43:12,389
- My name is Thompson.
- And Thomson.

550
00:43:12,469 --> 00:43:14,309
- We're police officers!
- We're police officers!

551
00:43:16,029 --> 00:43:17,349
Oh, crumbs.

552
00:43:19,629 --> 00:43:20,949
Good gracious!

553
00:43:21,029 --> 00:43:22,269
- Mr. Silk!
- Mr. Silk!

554
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:23,949
- Dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.
- Are you okay?

555
00:43:24,029 --> 00:43:25,349
Poor fellow!

556
00:43:27,589 --> 00:43:29,509
- Are you all right?
- Are you all right, sir?

557
00:43:29,589 --> 00:43:32,029
- Here, let me help you up.
- Thank you, that's very kind.

558
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:34,349
- No need to run away, sir.
- No, no, you see,

559
00:43:34,429 --> 00:43:37,709
yesterday we very nearly caught the
pickpocket who's been terrorising the town!

560
00:43:37,789 --> 00:43:38,749
Pickpocket?

561
00:43:38,829 --> 00:43:41,989
We pulled his jacket off
and inside we found a wallet.

562
00:43:42,069 --> 00:43:43,869
A wallet with your name and address!

563
00:43:43,949 --> 00:43:46,029
- That's my wallet.
- Well, it's obvious he stole it from you.

564
00:43:46,109 --> 00:43:48,029
- No, no, that's my wallet.
- Are you all right, sir?

565
00:43:48,109 --> 00:43:50,589
We didn't mean to startle you.
Let us help you into your apartment.

566
00:43:51,069 --> 00:43:53,989
Thank you so much. No need to come in.
I'll be quite all right, really.

567
00:43:54,069 --> 00:43:56,589
- No, we insist.
- Better safe than sorry.

568
00:43:56,669 --> 00:43:58,869
- It's the least we can do.
- Thank you.

569
00:43:58,949 --> 00:44:00,349
There we are.

570
00:44:01,309 --> 00:44:03,269
Good grief! What's all this?

571
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:05,309
It's my collection?

572
00:44:05,789 --> 00:44:08,549
- What a lot of wallets!
- I can't help it.

573
00:44:08,629 --> 00:44:12,509
It started with coin purses
and sort of went on from there, really.

574
00:44:12,589 --> 00:44:15,709
You want to be careful. Haven't you heard?
There's a pickpocket about.

575
00:44:15,789 --> 00:44:19,389
- Yes, he'd love this. Can you imagine?
- What do you mean, "pickpocket"?

576
00:44:19,469 --> 00:44:20,869
A master criminal.

577
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:24,469
A bag-snatching, purse-pilfering,
wallet-lifting sneak thief!

578
00:44:24,549 --> 00:44:26,069
I'm not a bad person.

579
00:44:26,869 --> 00:44:28,549
I'm a kleptomaniac.

580
00:44:29,149 --> 00:44:31,669
- A what?
- It's a fear of open spaces.

581
00:44:31,949 --> 00:44:34,669
Poor man. No wonder he keeps his wallets
in the living room.

582
00:44:34,749 --> 00:44:38,349
Wallets.
I just can't resist the lovely little things.

583
00:44:38,429 --> 00:44:40,989
It's a harmless little habit, really.

584
00:44:41,069 --> 00:44:44,189
Good heavens, Thomson, look at this!
His name's Thompson, too.

585
00:44:44,269 --> 00:44:45,269
What a coincidence.

586
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:47,949
No, Thomson, this is Thomson without a "P,"
as in "psychic."

587
00:44:48,029 --> 00:44:51,029
No, no, no, it's Thompson with a "P,"
as in "psychologist."

588
00:44:51,109 --> 00:44:53,349
Look at this one!
A green one that I managed to pick

589
00:44:53,429 --> 00:44:55,629
from a pickpocket
actually pickpocketing at the time.

590
00:44:55,709 --> 00:44:57,349
- And this one! Cuir de cochon.
- No, you have it all wrong.

591
00:44:57,429 --> 00:45:00,269
- There is a "P" in "psychic."
- I am not your sidekick! You are mine!

592
00:45:00,349 --> 00:45:02,829
- Smell it, won't you? Piggy leather!
- No, you have it all wrong.

593
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:04,509
- How dare you!
- How dare you!

594
00:45:04,829 --> 00:45:06,469
- I met you first.
- I met you first.

595
00:45:06,549 --> 00:45:07,509
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.

596
00:45:07,589 --> 00:45:08,589
- No, you did not.
- Yes, I did.

597
00:45:08,669 --> 00:45:09,669
- Didn't!
- Did!

598
00:45:09,749 --> 00:45:11,989
- Listen! I can't stand it any more!
- Hey!

599
00:45:12,069 --> 00:45:14,149
All right, I'll come quietly.

600
00:45:14,229 --> 00:45:16,589
Take them! Take them! Take them all!

601
00:45:16,669 --> 00:45:18,669
Stop it. Pull yourself together, man!

602
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:21,149
We can't take your wallets!
Do we look like thieves?

603
00:45:21,469 --> 00:45:23,309
Good heavens, Thompson.

604
00:45:23,749 --> 00:45:25,189
This looks familiar.

605
00:45:25,269 --> 00:45:26,549
Can't be.

606
00:45:27,229 --> 00:45:28,349
It is!

607
00:45:28,749 --> 00:45:29,749
- Tintin!
- Tintin!

608
00:45:38,309 --> 00:45:40,909
I'm so cold.

609
00:45:40,989 --> 00:45:42,429
And thirsty.

610
00:45:45,509 --> 00:45:47,309
My throat is parched.

611
00:45:47,389 --> 00:45:49,309
Let's see if there's any fresh water.

612
00:45:57,149 --> 00:45:59,549
What have we here?

613
00:46:03,749 --> 00:46:06,669
Tintin.

614
00:46:07,549 --> 00:46:09,109
Come and warm yourself, laddie.

615
00:46:09,709 --> 00:46:10,909
Captain?

616
00:46:11,829 --> 00:46:14,349
- What have you done?
- No need to thank me.

617
00:46:14,429 --> 00:46:15,509
What?

618
00:46:15,589 --> 00:46:19,229
Well, you looked a little cold,
so I lit a wee fire.

619
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:20,349
In a boat?

620
00:46:20,429 --> 00:46:22,669
No! Those are our oars! We need those oars!

621
00:46:22,749 --> 00:46:24,389
Yes, but not for much longer.

622
00:46:24,469 --> 00:46:27,509
Have you gone mad?
Quick, Captain, help me!

623
00:46:27,869 --> 00:46:30,189
- Captain, help me, quick!
- He's right. What have I done?

624
00:46:30,269 --> 00:46:32,509
- What have I done?
- No, Captain, not that!

625
00:46:35,069 --> 00:46:37,389
Thundering typhoons!

626
00:46:38,189 --> 00:46:39,509
Well, this is a fine mess.

627
00:46:39,589 --> 00:46:40,549
- I'm weak.
- We're stranded here...

628
00:46:40,629 --> 00:46:42,349
- Selfish.
...with no hope of rescue...

629
00:46:42,429 --> 00:46:43,509
I'm hopeless.

630
00:46:43,589 --> 00:46:45,469
...while Sakharine and his men
are halfway to Bagghar.

631
00:46:45,549 --> 00:46:47,549
Poor, miserable wretch!

632
00:46:47,629 --> 00:46:49,109
Yes, all right. That's enough of that.

633
00:46:50,269 --> 00:46:53,869
It was his fault, you see. It was Sir Francis.

634
00:46:53,949 --> 00:46:55,309
Tell me, how did you work that one out?

635
00:46:55,389 --> 00:46:58,269
Because he was a figurehead
of great courage and bold exploits.

636
00:46:58,349 --> 00:47:01,309
No one like him ever existed in my family.

637
00:47:02,349 --> 00:47:04,269
Why do you think I drink?

638
00:47:04,349 --> 00:47:06,349
Because I know I'll never be like him.

639
00:47:06,429 --> 00:47:11,069
No, it's far better that I end it now.
Put us both out of our misery.

640
00:47:13,149 --> 00:47:14,669
What is it, Snowy?

641
00:47:14,749 --> 00:47:17,189
I'm gonna lower myself into the sea.

642
00:47:19,829 --> 00:47:23,949
Into the cold embrace of the big blue!

643
00:47:24,589 --> 00:47:25,989
Those are Portuguese markings.

644
00:47:26,069 --> 00:47:28,949
- Are you even listening?
- Where is the Karaboudjan registered?

645
00:47:29,029 --> 00:47:30,549
We're saved.

646
00:47:30,629 --> 00:47:31,909
We're saved!

647
00:47:31,989 --> 00:47:34,909
It's a sign from above!

648
00:47:40,669 --> 00:47:43,149
- Troglodytes!
- Captain, get down.

649
00:47:43,229 --> 00:47:47,469
Slave-traders! Mutant malingerers!

650
00:47:47,549 --> 00:47:50,269
Freshwater politicians!

651
00:47:51,309 --> 00:47:53,709
Bad news, Captain.
We've only got one bullet.

652
00:47:53,789 --> 00:47:56,589
- And what's the good news?
- We've got one bullet.

653
00:48:09,069 --> 00:48:10,269
You got him!

654
00:48:15,349 --> 00:48:16,549
Well done, my boy.

655
00:48:24,069 --> 00:48:25,189
Stay here, Captain.

656
00:48:25,949 --> 00:48:28,629
Tintin?

657
00:48:28,709 --> 00:48:31,829
- Don't take your eyes off of them.
- Hurry up!

658
00:48:33,149 --> 00:48:36,589
Just as I thought.
The ignition lead has been cut.

659
00:48:37,629 --> 00:48:39,269
Lucky shot!

660
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:41,669
One more pass, and we will finish them off.

661
00:48:42,829 --> 00:48:43,869
Put your hands in the air.

662
00:48:45,189 --> 00:48:46,229
Now!

663
00:48:50,309 --> 00:48:51,549
Let's see here.

664
00:48:53,069 --> 00:48:55,709
You do know what you're doing, eh, Tintin?

665
00:48:56,909 --> 00:48:58,309
More or less.

666
00:49:00,549 --> 00:49:03,029
Well, which is it? More or less?

667
00:49:03,109 --> 00:49:06,309
Relax. I interviewed a pilot once.

668
00:49:15,549 --> 00:49:17,509
Which way to North Africa?

669
00:49:29,109 --> 00:49:30,549
Captain, look!

670
00:49:30,909 --> 00:49:32,869
We've caught up with them.

671
00:49:34,789 --> 00:49:36,429
Wonderful!

672
00:49:36,509 --> 00:49:39,189
But you think we might find another way
to North Africa

673
00:49:39,269 --> 00:49:41,869
that doesn't take us
through that Wall of Death?

674
00:49:46,629 --> 00:49:48,469
We can't turn back.

675
00:49:48,549 --> 00:49:51,709
Not now.

676
00:50:12,869 --> 00:50:16,309
No, Captain! Those are surgical spirits
for medicinal purposes only.

677
00:50:16,429 --> 00:50:18,749
Quite right, laddie, quite right.

678
00:51:14,069 --> 00:51:15,269
No, no, no!

679
00:51:15,349 --> 00:51:17,749
The fuel tank! It's almost empty!

680
00:51:17,829 --> 00:51:20,389
Captain! This may sound crazy,
but I've got a plan.

681
00:51:20,989 --> 00:51:24,389
The alcohol in that bottle
may give us a few more miles.

682
00:51:25,349 --> 00:51:28,709
I need you to climb out of the plane
and pour it into the fuel tank.

683
00:51:28,789 --> 00:51:30,429
Christopher Columbus!

684
00:51:36,789 --> 00:51:39,189
There's a terrible storm out there.

685
00:51:40,389 --> 00:51:42,229
And it's raining.

686
00:51:42,989 --> 00:51:44,829
And you call yourself a Haddock?

687
00:51:50,469 --> 00:51:51,669
Captain!

688
00:51:51,749 --> 00:51:54,029
Captain! Can you hear me?

689
00:51:54,109 --> 00:51:55,309
Captain!

690
00:51:56,109 --> 00:51:57,309
Captain?

691
00:51:59,189 --> 00:52:02,709
You're doing fine!
Now, pour the bottle into the tank.

692
00:52:03,589 --> 00:52:05,429
We're running on fumes.

693
00:52:06,749 --> 00:52:08,349
Fumes!

694
00:52:16,669 --> 00:52:17,949
Oh, no.

695
00:52:32,869 --> 00:52:34,669
Captain! I can't see!

696
00:52:34,749 --> 00:52:36,389
Land! Land!

697
00:52:36,869 --> 00:52:38,549
We can't! We're not there yet!

698
00:52:38,629 --> 00:52:40,349
No, land!

699
00:52:47,829 --> 00:52:49,549
No, no, no, starboard! Starboard! Starboard!

700
00:53:30,389 --> 00:53:31,909
Hang on, Tintin!

701
00:53:33,509 --> 00:53:35,549
I'm coming!

702
00:54:17,669 --> 00:54:22,029
The Land of Thirst.

703
00:54:22,109 --> 00:54:24,509
- The Land of Thirst.
- Will you stop saying that?

704
00:54:24,589 --> 00:54:27,549
You don't understand. I've run out.

705
00:54:28,269 --> 00:54:32,149
I've run out.
You don't know what that means.

706
00:54:32,229 --> 00:54:33,869
Captain, we have to keep going.

707
00:54:33,949 --> 00:54:37,309
One step at a time. Come on, on your feet!
Lean your weight on me.

708
00:54:37,389 --> 00:54:40,709
A man can only hang on so long
without his vitals.

709
00:54:40,789 --> 00:54:43,749
Captain, calm down.
There are worse things than sobering up.

710
00:54:43,829 --> 00:54:45,349
Look! Tintin!

711
00:54:46,029 --> 00:54:47,109
We're saved.

712
00:54:47,949 --> 00:54:49,789
Water. Water!

713
00:54:50,109 --> 00:54:51,869
Stop! Captain!

714
00:54:52,189 --> 00:54:53,789
It's just a mirage!

715
00:54:53,869 --> 00:54:56,669
But it was here. I saw it.

716
00:54:56,749 --> 00:55:00,509
It was just your mind playing tricks.
It's the heat!

717
00:55:00,589 --> 00:55:02,189
I have to go home.

718
00:55:03,309 --> 00:55:05,549
- What?
- I have to go back to the sea.

719
00:55:05,629 --> 00:55:07,549
Captain, you're hallucinating.

720
00:55:07,629 --> 00:55:09,149
Look.

721
00:55:09,229 --> 00:55:12,669
Did you ever see a more beautiful sight?

722
00:55:14,109 --> 00:55:17,789
She's turning into the wind, all sails set.

723
00:55:18,949 --> 00:55:20,389
Triple masted.

724
00:55:20,749 --> 00:55:23,709
Double decks. Fifty guns.

725
00:55:24,709 --> 00:55:25,949
The Unicorn?

726
00:55:26,029 --> 00:55:29,229
- Isn't she a beauty?
- Yes! Yes, she is!

727
00:55:29,309 --> 00:55:32,109
Tell me, Captain, what else can you see?

728
00:55:33,429 --> 00:55:35,869
She's got the wind behind her.

729
00:55:35,949 --> 00:55:37,949
Look at the pace she's setting!

730
00:55:38,989 --> 00:55:41,749
Barely a day out of Barbados,

731
00:55:41,829 --> 00:55:44,429
a hold full of rum and the finest tobacco

732
00:55:44,509 --> 00:55:47,829
and the hearts of the sailors set for home.

733
00:56:13,349 --> 00:56:14,709
The red pennant.

734
00:56:15,149 --> 00:56:18,349
The blood runs cold in every sea captain
who looks upon that flag,

735
00:56:18,429 --> 00:56:20,589
for he knows he's facing a fight to the death.

736
00:56:20,669 --> 00:56:24,349
But Sir Francis is a Haddock.

737
00:56:24,429 --> 00:56:27,789
And Haddocks don't flee.

738
00:56:30,349 --> 00:56:34,229
All hands on deck! Gunners to their stations!

739
00:56:34,309 --> 00:56:36,949
Let's unload the King's shot into these

740
00:56:37,069 --> 00:56:39,549
yellow-bellied, lily-livered sea slugs!

741
00:56:39,629 --> 00:56:42,949
- Prepare to bring her about, Mr. Nicholls.
- Aye-aye, Captain!

742
00:56:43,029 --> 00:56:45,029
Prepare to bring her about!

743
00:56:57,029 --> 00:56:58,389
Fire!

744
00:56:58,709 --> 00:57:00,589
Portside gun, fire!

745
00:57:03,069 --> 00:57:04,989
Look lively, lads!

746
00:57:19,629 --> 00:57:22,989
- Mr. Nicholls, secure the cargo.
- Right you are, sir.

747
00:57:23,069 --> 00:57:25,629
Prepare to repel all boarders!

748
00:58:00,429 --> 00:58:03,149
This way! We need more men!

749
00:58:57,149 --> 00:58:58,429
And then he saw him.

750
00:59:00,589 --> 00:59:04,029
Like a phantom, rising from the dead.

751
00:59:05,389 --> 00:59:07,149
Who?

752
00:59:07,229 --> 00:59:09,389
Captain, who did he see?

753
00:59:11,269 --> 00:59:12,829
It's gone.

754
00:59:13,869 --> 00:59:16,589
What do you mean, gone?
What happened next?

755
00:59:17,309 --> 00:59:20,829
By Jupiter, I have a beard!
Since when did I have a beard?

756
00:59:20,909 --> 00:59:23,469
Captain, something happened
on the Unicorn.

757
00:59:23,549 --> 00:59:26,989
It's the key to everything.
You must try to remember.

758
00:59:27,069 --> 00:59:29,709
The Unicorn? What? I'm so terribly thirsty.

759
00:59:29,789 --> 00:59:32,029
- Captain!
- Tintin!

760
00:59:32,109 --> 00:59:33,989
What is happening to me?

761
00:59:40,589 --> 00:59:44,109
And to think all it took was a day
in the Sahara.

762
00:59:44,909 --> 00:59:47,869
Congratulations, Captain, you're sober.

763
00:59:48,829 --> 00:59:50,949
Sober.

764
01:00:06,429 --> 01:00:07,669
Good dog!

765
01:00:09,949 --> 01:00:11,949
This one's alive.

766
01:00:12,029 --> 01:00:13,949
- Check the other!
- Yes, sir.

767
01:00:16,949 --> 01:00:19,029
Company, halt!

768
01:00:19,149 --> 01:00:22,669
I'm Lieutenant Delcourt.
Welcome to the Afghar Outpost.

769
01:00:22,749 --> 01:00:25,789
Thank you, Lieutenant. We owe you our lives.

770
01:00:25,869 --> 01:00:29,989
- Did you find my friend?
- Yes, but he's not in good shape, I'm afraid.

771
01:00:30,069 --> 01:00:34,349
He's still suffering the effects
of acute dehydration. He's quite delirious.

772
01:00:34,429 --> 01:00:36,509
Why don't we pay him a visit?

773
01:00:37,189 --> 01:00:39,429
Haddock! You're awake.

774
01:00:39,789 --> 01:00:42,549
Good! I have a visitor for you.

775
01:00:42,909 --> 01:00:44,629
- Captain?
- Hello!

776
01:00:44,709 --> 01:00:46,349
I think you've got the wrong room.

777
01:00:47,869 --> 01:00:49,629
Captain, it's Tintin.

778
01:00:49,709 --> 01:00:52,109
Our plane crashed in the desert.
Don't you remember?

779
01:00:52,189 --> 01:00:55,789
Plane? No, no, I'm a naval man myself.
I never fly if I can help it.

780
01:00:55,869 --> 01:00:58,149
He's got me confused with someone else.

781
01:00:58,229 --> 01:01:00,749
What is this peculiar liquid?

782
01:01:00,829 --> 01:01:03,149
There's no bouquet.
It's completely transparent.

783
01:01:03,229 --> 01:01:04,269
Why, it's water.

784
01:01:04,349 --> 01:01:06,669
What will they think of next?

785
01:01:08,989 --> 01:01:12,909
We suspect he has a concussion.
Heatstroke. Delirium.

786
01:01:12,989 --> 01:01:14,509
He's sober.

787
01:01:14,589 --> 01:01:16,989
Now, Captain, out in the desert...

788
01:01:17,069 --> 01:01:19,389
- The desert?
- Yes. You were talking about Sir Francis.

789
01:01:19,469 --> 01:01:21,709
- Sir who?
- Sir Francis.

790
01:01:21,789 --> 01:01:23,869
And you were telling me
about what happened on the Unicorn.

791
01:01:23,949 --> 01:01:26,029
- The unicorn!
- Yes!

792
01:01:26,109 --> 01:01:28,589
The stuff that dreams are made of.

793
01:01:28,669 --> 01:01:30,349
Wee children's dreams.

794
01:01:30,429 --> 01:01:33,629
No, the ship.
Please try to remember, Captain.

795
01:01:33,709 --> 01:01:35,309
Lives are at risk.

796
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:41,589
Snowy, what have you done?

797
01:01:45,709 --> 01:01:47,589
I'd stand back if I were you.

798
01:01:50,589 --> 01:01:53,109
Out! Everybody out of the room!

799
01:01:53,869 --> 01:01:55,149
Snowy!

800
01:01:55,229 --> 01:01:56,909
This man is insane!

801
01:02:03,269 --> 01:02:06,909
Show yourself, Red Rackham!

802
01:02:12,829 --> 01:02:16,069
If it's a fight you want,
you've met your match!

803
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:17,269
A fight with who?

804
01:02:17,629 --> 01:02:20,789
To the death, Red Rackham!

805
01:02:43,149 --> 01:02:44,189
No, wait!

806
01:02:47,229 --> 01:02:48,469
Wait. Captain...

807
01:02:49,709 --> 01:02:51,869
I remember everything now.

808
01:02:51,949 --> 01:02:54,109
Everything Granddaddy told me.

809
01:02:54,829 --> 01:02:57,549
The Unicorn was taken.

810
01:02:58,029 --> 01:03:00,869
The pirates were now masters of the ship.

811
01:03:00,949 --> 01:03:02,269
The crew surrendered?

812
01:03:02,349 --> 01:03:08,029
Granddaddy said that Red Rackham
called Sir Francis the King's dog.

813
01:03:08,149 --> 01:03:12,149
A pirate hunter sent to reclaim
their hard-won plunder.

814
01:03:13,629 --> 01:03:17,749
Why would I waste my time on rum,
tobacco, molasses and dates

815
01:03:17,829 --> 01:03:20,749
when you have
a more valuable cargo onboard?

816
01:03:20,829 --> 01:03:22,269
Where is it?

817
01:03:22,789 --> 01:03:24,829
You'll have to kill me first.

818
01:03:24,909 --> 01:03:26,589
Not first, no.

819
01:03:26,749 --> 01:03:27,829
Please.

820
01:03:28,349 --> 01:03:30,269
I'll start with your men.

821
01:03:32,909 --> 01:03:35,149
To save his men,

822
01:03:35,229 --> 01:03:38,029
he would give up the secret cargo.

823
01:03:38,109 --> 01:03:39,549
And where was it?

824
01:03:57,549 --> 01:04:02,469
Four hundredweight
of gold, jewels and treasure.

825
01:04:12,189 --> 01:04:13,789
Kill his men!

826
01:04:13,909 --> 01:04:15,829
No, Rackham! No!

827
01:04:17,229 --> 01:04:20,109
Rackham, you gave me your word! Rackham!

828
01:04:20,429 --> 01:04:22,029
Rackham!

829
01:04:25,389 --> 01:04:28,189
Sir Francis knew he was doomed.

830
01:04:28,269 --> 01:04:31,029
That he'd be hung from the highest yardarm.

831
01:04:32,269 --> 01:04:34,189
But they didn't reckon on one thing!

832
01:04:34,509 --> 01:04:37,469
Sir Francis was a Haddock.

833
01:04:37,949 --> 01:04:42,389
And a Haddock always has a trick
up his sleeve.

834
01:04:58,029 --> 01:05:00,589
And with that, he hurls himself forward!

835
01:05:00,669 --> 01:05:02,669
On the pirates? Like that? Unarmed?

836
01:05:02,749 --> 01:05:05,469
No! No, on a bottle of rum
rolling on the deck.

837
01:05:05,549 --> 01:05:08,749
And he opens it up,
and puts it to his lips, and...

838
01:05:08,829 --> 01:05:10,029
And then he stops.

839
01:05:10,109 --> 01:05:13,469
"This is no time for drinking," he says.
"I need all my wits about me."

840
01:05:13,549 --> 01:05:16,349
With that, he puts down the bottle and...

841
01:05:16,429 --> 01:05:17,909
Yes, yes, he puts down the bottle...

842
01:05:17,989 --> 01:05:20,149
And he seizes a cutlass.

843
01:05:20,509 --> 01:05:25,989
And then he makes his way
to the ship's magazine,

844
01:05:26,069 --> 01:05:28,989
where they keep all the gunpowder
and the shot!

845
01:05:41,229 --> 01:05:43,029
You dog!

846
01:05:43,109 --> 01:05:45,229
You'd blow us sky high?

847
01:05:45,309 --> 01:05:46,749
Come on, then.

848
01:05:47,789 --> 01:05:49,269
Let's have you.

849
01:05:52,629 --> 01:05:54,469
Not this time.

850
01:06:51,869 --> 01:06:53,309
You!

851
01:06:53,789 --> 01:06:54,909
Captain, what is it?

852
01:06:57,789 --> 01:07:00,429
How could I be so blind?

853
01:07:00,509 --> 01:07:02,349
What are you talking about?

854
01:07:03,629 --> 01:07:06,869
This isn't just about the scrolls or...

855
01:07:06,949 --> 01:07:09,189
Or the treasure that went down with the ship.

856
01:07:10,909 --> 01:07:12,189
It's me.

857
01:07:13,509 --> 01:07:15,189
It's me he's after!

858
01:07:17,629 --> 01:07:21,189
You'll suffer a curse upon you
and your name, Haddock.

859
01:07:21,269 --> 01:07:23,069
He wants vengeance.

860
01:07:24,669 --> 01:07:27,069
Come back and face me!

861
01:07:27,309 --> 01:07:28,469
- Hurry, Tintin.
- What?

862
01:07:28,549 --> 01:07:30,149
- We're out of time.
- Captain!

863
01:07:45,709 --> 01:07:47,589
I curse you!

864
01:07:47,829 --> 01:07:52,229
I curse your name and all who come after!

865
01:07:52,309 --> 01:07:54,749
We will meet again, Haddock!

866
01:07:54,829 --> 01:07:57,949
In another time! In another life!

867
01:08:16,829 --> 01:08:19,149
It's not over. It was never over!

868
01:08:19,229 --> 01:08:21,349
I don't understand. Who's after your blood?

869
01:08:21,429 --> 01:08:23,549
- Sakharine!
- Sakharine? Why?

870
01:08:23,629 --> 01:08:27,149
He's Red Rackham's descendent!
He means to finish it!

871
01:08:27,229 --> 01:08:28,989
- That's why he did it.
- Did what?

872
01:08:29,069 --> 01:08:32,869
Sank his own ship. Sir Francis sent
that treasure to the bottom of the sea.

873
01:08:32,949 --> 01:08:35,069
He would be damned
before he let Red Rackham have it.

874
01:08:35,189 --> 01:08:36,749
- And he was.
- But he couldn't let it lie.

875
01:08:36,829 --> 01:08:38,309
- No.
- He left a clue.

876
01:08:38,389 --> 01:08:41,149
Three clues wrapped in a riddle,
concealing a secret.

877
01:08:41,229 --> 01:08:43,789
But only a true Haddock
would be able to solve it.

878
01:08:43,869 --> 01:08:46,109
- What secret?
- The location.

879
01:08:46,189 --> 01:08:48,909
To one of the greatest sunken treasures
in all history.

880
01:08:48,989 --> 01:08:51,709
The wreck of the Unicorn.

881
01:08:51,789 --> 01:08:55,549
He means to steal it! The third scroll!

882
01:08:56,389 --> 01:08:58,989
Billions of blue, blistering barnacles!

883
01:08:59,069 --> 01:09:03,709
I swear, as the last of the Haddocks,
I'll find that treasure before him!

884
01:09:04,029 --> 01:09:07,109
To Bagghar.

885
01:09:26,669 --> 01:09:27,949
He's here.

886
01:09:51,149 --> 01:09:53,309
It's no good. They could be anywhere.

887
01:09:56,869 --> 01:09:58,269
Captain.

888
01:09:58,349 --> 01:10:00,749
Don't look now, but we're being followed.

889
01:10:02,389 --> 01:10:04,469
Yes, we are.

890
01:10:07,869 --> 01:10:10,709
What do you want?
Why are you following us?

891
01:10:10,789 --> 01:10:13,549
Who are you working for?

892
01:10:13,629 --> 01:10:14,989
Captain, stop! Stop!

893
01:10:15,949 --> 01:10:17,709
- Thompson and Thomson.
- Not so loud.

894
01:10:17,789 --> 01:10:19,869
- We're in disguise.
- So I see.

895
01:10:19,949 --> 01:10:21,869
You got the message I sent from the ship?

896
01:10:21,949 --> 01:10:24,269
Yes, well, bit of a long story, that.

897
01:10:24,349 --> 01:10:26,669
The upshot is we caught the thief,
retrieved your wallet,

898
01:10:26,749 --> 01:10:28,349
and then hopped on the next plane
to Bagghar.

899
01:10:28,429 --> 01:10:31,309
Yes, that pocket picker
has picked his last pocket.

900
01:10:31,389 --> 01:10:34,029
There. Don't worry.
He didn't take any money.

901
01:10:34,109 --> 01:10:36,629
It's not the money I'm worried about.

902
01:10:41,349 --> 01:10:42,469
The odds are even.

903
01:10:43,789 --> 01:10:46,109
Now, to find the next two scrolls.

904
01:10:50,589 --> 01:10:52,229
The Milanese Nightingale.

905
01:10:59,549 --> 01:11:01,309
That's his secret weapon?

906
01:11:01,469 --> 01:11:03,069
- My!
- My!

907
01:11:04,749 --> 01:11:06,389
What a dish.

908
01:11:11,869 --> 01:11:13,549
Enchanted, signora!

909
01:11:13,629 --> 01:11:16,109
Benvenuto! Welcome! Marhaba!

910
01:11:16,429 --> 01:11:18,909
We are blessed with your presence.

911
01:11:18,989 --> 01:11:23,389
Yes. Indeed, Signor Salad!

912
01:11:23,469 --> 01:11:26,029
What charming peasants.

913
01:11:27,469 --> 01:11:29,709
May I introduce my escort,

914
01:11:29,789 --> 01:11:32,829
Monsieur Shuggair Addeitiff.

915
01:11:33,629 --> 01:11:34,989
He's been very

916
01:11:36,429 --> 01:11:40,189
passionate in his support of this concert.

917
01:11:40,269 --> 01:11:43,469
It's my first visit to the Third World.

918
01:11:43,549 --> 01:11:48,029
Please forgive me. I must escort madame
to her dressing room. Excuse us.

919
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:54,589
After you.

920
01:12:05,469 --> 01:12:08,189
- Hello, how are you?
- Hello...

921
01:12:11,709 --> 01:12:14,389
Here. I want you to look after this.

922
01:12:14,949 --> 01:12:16,149
- What are you doing?
- Me?

923
01:12:16,229 --> 01:12:17,909
- Yes.
- Are you sure?

924
01:12:17,989 --> 01:12:20,109
If I'm caught,
I don't want them to find this on me.

925
01:12:20,189 --> 01:12:22,349
Look, just keep it hidden.

926
01:12:23,269 --> 01:12:25,229
I will guard this with my life!

927
01:12:25,309 --> 01:12:26,429
Get up! Get up!

928
01:13:00,989 --> 01:13:02,269
It's her!

929
01:13:53,469 --> 01:13:55,229
Blistering barnacles!

930
01:13:56,469 --> 01:13:58,069
What's that noise?

931
01:14:04,709 --> 01:14:05,989
My ears,

932
01:14:07,309 --> 01:14:09,269
- they're bleeding.
- No, they're not.

933
01:14:19,069 --> 01:14:20,269
Captain.

934
01:14:23,229 --> 01:14:24,669
Shut up, Snowy.

935
01:14:31,429 --> 01:14:34,269
Oh, Columbus, it's every man for himself!
Make way.

936
01:14:34,349 --> 01:14:36,749
Make way! Medical emergency.

937
01:14:57,669 --> 01:14:58,749
That was close.

938
01:15:00,629 --> 01:15:01,709
Hello, Captain.

939
01:15:01,789 --> 01:15:02,829
You!

940
01:15:37,469 --> 01:15:38,549
Oh, no!

941
01:15:41,909 --> 01:15:43,189
Sakharine!

942
01:16:09,149 --> 01:16:11,069
The falcon! Snowy, after him!

943
01:16:11,189 --> 01:16:13,629
Tintin! Tintin!

944
01:16:13,709 --> 01:16:16,469
Those two! There!
They're here to steal your ship!

945
01:16:16,549 --> 01:16:17,909
No, no, no, no, no, we're not!

946
01:16:17,989 --> 01:16:20,069
Arrest him! The ugly one!

947
01:16:20,149 --> 01:16:21,549
- No, wait!
- Who, me?

948
01:16:21,629 --> 01:16:22,669
Yes!

949
01:16:22,749 --> 01:16:24,429
Thief! Arrest him!

950
01:16:45,469 --> 01:16:46,669
Captain!

951
01:16:48,989 --> 01:16:50,989
- Sakharine's got the scroll!
- It's worse than that.

952
01:16:51,069 --> 01:16:54,589
- What do you mean?
- They took your scroll, Tintin. It's gone.

953
01:16:54,669 --> 01:16:56,589
How? What happened?

954
01:16:56,669 --> 01:16:58,469
It was Allan.

955
01:16:58,549 --> 01:17:01,149
He knobbled me in the garden, and then

956
01:17:01,229 --> 01:17:03,429
- there was a bottle of alcohol and...
- There always is.

957
01:17:03,509 --> 01:17:05,789
No, no! No, not like that.

958
01:17:07,789 --> 01:17:09,589
I can smell it on you.

959
01:17:16,989 --> 01:17:18,469
Hurry. Back to the boat.

960
01:17:19,669 --> 01:17:22,469
- Tintin! Where are you going?
- I'm going after Sakharine.

961
01:17:22,549 --> 01:17:24,269
- By yourself?
- Yes!

962
01:17:24,349 --> 01:17:25,789
Come on, Snowy!

963
01:17:28,949 --> 01:17:31,029
Catch them, catch them!

964
01:17:43,189 --> 01:17:45,909
Lose them! Get him off our tail!

965
01:17:58,589 --> 01:18:00,349
Did you hit anything?

966
01:18:03,189 --> 01:18:04,589
Oh, dear.

967
01:18:09,949 --> 01:18:11,989
Faster, you idiot, faster!

968
01:18:17,749 --> 01:18:19,389
Not again!

969
01:18:20,549 --> 01:18:22,429
- I'll have those, thank you.
- Come on, Snowy!

970
01:18:22,509 --> 01:18:23,509
No!

971
01:18:23,589 --> 01:18:25,749
Incoming falcon at four o'clock!

972
01:18:38,269 --> 01:18:40,829
Tintin, faster!

973
01:18:43,389 --> 01:18:46,109
- The scrolls!
- I got one, two...

974
01:18:46,189 --> 01:18:47,389
And three!

975
01:18:48,709 --> 01:18:49,989
Snowy!

976
01:18:59,229 --> 01:19:00,829
Oh, no! Not again.

977
01:19:02,869 --> 01:19:04,589
Come here, my beauty.

978
01:19:06,749 --> 01:19:10,749
Ten thousand thundering typhoons!
Come here, you pilfering parakeet!

979
01:19:12,989 --> 01:19:15,029
Captain, the bird! Grab it!

980
01:19:20,109 --> 01:19:22,509
Nice work, Snowy! Don't let him go!

981
01:19:30,069 --> 01:19:32,789
You blue blistering barnacles!

982
01:19:33,789 --> 01:19:36,109
Hang on, Snowy! Snowy, I'm coming!

983
01:19:41,949 --> 01:19:43,909
There he is! Stop!

984
01:19:43,989 --> 01:19:46,069
That's right, that's right, come to Daddy.

985
01:19:46,149 --> 01:19:47,709
Come to Daddy.

986
01:19:47,789 --> 01:19:48,829
Gotcha!

987
01:19:50,589 --> 01:19:51,869
No!

988
01:19:55,429 --> 01:19:58,109
Geronimo!

989
01:19:59,549 --> 01:20:02,509
You double-dealing, pilfering parasites!

990
01:20:09,349 --> 01:20:11,829
Excuse me. Pardon me. Sorry.

991
01:20:39,909 --> 01:20:41,149
Gotcha!

992
01:20:45,949 --> 01:20:47,829
The scrolls are lining up.

993
01:20:47,909 --> 01:20:49,469
These are hidden numbers.

994
01:20:51,829 --> 01:20:53,029
What does it say?

995
01:20:53,109 --> 01:20:55,189
I wouldn't do that if I were you!

996
01:20:55,869 --> 01:20:57,429
Let the bird go.

997
01:20:59,829 --> 01:21:02,829
What do you value more,
those scrolls or Haddock's life?

998
01:21:02,909 --> 01:21:03,949
Don't listen to him.

999
01:21:04,029 --> 01:21:06,309
You'll never get away with this,
you sour-faced sassonack!

1000
01:21:06,389 --> 01:21:07,509
I will kill him.

1001
01:21:09,389 --> 01:21:11,509
Don't worry about me, Tintin, I'm fine.

1002
01:21:11,589 --> 01:21:14,509
Let the bird go now, or this man dies!

1003
01:21:14,589 --> 01:21:15,829
No! Wait!

1004
01:21:16,509 --> 01:21:20,349
You two-timing troglodyte!
You simpering son of a po-faced profiteer!

1005
01:21:20,429 --> 01:21:24,429
Perhaps we should put it to the test.
Here's mud in your eye.

1006
01:21:24,509 --> 01:21:25,549
Fathead!

1007
01:21:25,629 --> 01:21:26,829
Captain!

1008
01:21:51,829 --> 01:21:54,429
- We're saved!
- I love the beach.

1009
01:21:54,509 --> 01:21:57,349
- You said you wanted a holiday.
- Quite.

1010
01:21:57,429 --> 01:21:58,709
Very good.

1011
01:22:06,229 --> 01:22:09,549
- Nobody takes my ship!
- They've already taken it.

1012
01:22:09,629 --> 01:22:11,989
Nobody takes my ship twice!

1013
01:22:12,349 --> 01:22:15,309
We'll show them, won't we, Tintin?
All right then, what's the plan?

1014
01:22:15,389 --> 01:22:16,389
There is no plan.

1015
01:22:16,469 --> 01:22:18,589
Of course there's a plan.
You've always got a plan.

1016
01:22:18,669 --> 01:22:19,709
Not this time.

1017
01:22:20,309 --> 01:22:23,469
Sakharine has the scrolls.
They'll lead him to the treasure.

1018
01:22:23,549 --> 01:22:26,749
It could be anywhere in the world.
We'll never see him again.

1019
01:22:27,709 --> 01:22:28,989
It's over.

1020
01:22:30,109 --> 01:22:32,669
I thought you were an optimist.

1021
01:22:32,749 --> 01:22:35,789
Well, you were wrong, weren't you?
I'm a realist.

1022
01:22:35,869 --> 01:22:38,109
That's just another name for a quitter.

1023
01:22:38,189 --> 01:22:40,589
You can call me what you like.

1024
01:22:40,669 --> 01:22:43,229
Don't you get it? We failed.

1025
01:22:44,149 --> 01:22:45,269
"Failed."

1026
01:22:46,509 --> 01:22:49,709
There are plenty of others
willing to call you a failure.

1027
01:22:49,789 --> 01:22:53,909
A fool. A loser. A hopeless souse!

1028
01:22:53,989 --> 01:22:56,949
Don't you ever say it of yourself.

1029
01:22:58,749 --> 01:23:02,669
You send out the wrong signal.
That is what people pick up.

1030
01:23:02,749 --> 01:23:04,829
Do you understand?

1031
01:23:04,909 --> 01:23:07,789
You care about something, you fight for it.

1032
01:23:07,869 --> 01:23:10,909
You hit a wall, you push through it.

1033
01:23:11,989 --> 01:23:15,629
There's something you need to know
about failure, Tintin.

1034
01:23:20,029 --> 01:23:22,269
You can never let it defeat you.

1035
01:23:23,389 --> 01:23:24,949
What did you just say?

1036
01:23:25,029 --> 01:23:27,149
You hit a wall, you push through it.

1037
01:23:27,229 --> 01:23:30,749
No, no, no, you said something
about sending out a signal.

1038
01:23:33,949 --> 01:23:36,429
Of course! Captain!

1039
01:23:36,509 --> 01:23:38,949
I sent a radio message from the Karaboudjan.

1040
01:23:39,029 --> 01:23:41,069
I know what radio frequency
they're transmitting on.

1041
01:23:41,149 --> 01:23:42,389
Well, how does that help us?

1042
01:23:42,469 --> 01:23:44,589
All we have to do
is send that information to Interpol,

1043
01:23:44,669 --> 01:23:46,909
they can track the signals
and figure out which way they're headed.

1044
01:23:46,989 --> 01:23:47,989
Here comes Interpol now.

1045
01:23:48,189 --> 01:23:49,509
- Tintin!
- Tintin!

1046
01:23:49,589 --> 01:23:51,869
Any port they enter we'll know at once.

1047
01:23:52,029 --> 01:23:54,589
And we can get there first.

1048
01:24:05,869 --> 01:24:09,749
What are we doing here, boss? I don't get it.
We're right back where we started.

1049
01:24:09,829 --> 01:24:11,949
You're to speak of this to no one.
Keep your mouths shut.

1050
01:24:12,029 --> 01:24:15,629
- Don't worry. As long as we get our share.
- You'll get your share.

1051
01:24:15,709 --> 01:24:16,949
- Where are you going?
- Just guard the ship.

1052
01:24:17,029 --> 01:24:18,189
Where's the filthy moolah?

1053
01:24:18,269 --> 01:24:21,229
Good evening, sir.
I trust you had a successful trip abroad.

1054
01:24:21,309 --> 01:24:23,749
Do I pay you to talk to me?

1055
01:24:23,829 --> 01:24:25,709
You don't pay me at all.

1056
01:24:27,949 --> 01:24:29,389
What the blazes? Nestor!

1057
01:24:30,749 --> 01:24:31,869
Nestor!

1058
01:24:34,829 --> 01:24:36,269
Tom! Allan!

1059
01:24:36,349 --> 01:24:40,269
You blithering idiots, don't just stand there!
Do something!

1060
01:24:46,269 --> 01:24:48,069
Caught him like a rat in a trap.

1061
01:24:48,629 --> 01:24:51,229
Congratulations, gentlemen. He's all yours.

1062
01:24:51,309 --> 01:24:55,309
Yes! We also have an arrest warrant issued
by both Interpol and the FBI.

1063
01:24:55,389 --> 01:24:57,269
- Your friend who got shot...
- Barnaby.

1064
01:24:57,349 --> 01:25:00,109
...he was one of their agents.
Hot on Sakharine's trail from the start.

1065
01:25:00,189 --> 01:25:01,789
It still doesn't make sense.

1066
01:25:01,869 --> 01:25:04,069
He has the key to the treasure of the Unicorn,

1067
01:25:04,149 --> 01:25:06,829
which is sitting somewhere
on the ocean floor.

1068
01:25:06,909 --> 01:25:08,469
Why would he come back home?

1069
01:25:12,989 --> 01:25:14,149
Right.

1070
01:25:14,229 --> 01:25:15,269
- Sakharine?
- Sakharine?

1071
01:25:15,349 --> 01:25:17,469
That's Mr. Sakharine to you.

1072
01:25:18,069 --> 01:25:19,269
Hold it.

1073
01:25:25,709 --> 01:25:26,829
- Look out!
- What...

1074
01:25:26,909 --> 01:25:28,069
Oh, no!

1075
01:25:33,029 --> 01:25:35,389
Allan! Allan, get me down!

1076
01:25:38,909 --> 01:25:40,549
What? Not that way!

1077
01:25:43,709 --> 01:25:47,069
Not that way, you fool, the other way!

1078
01:25:57,749 --> 01:26:05,949
Right.

1079
01:26:25,949 --> 01:26:27,189
Look out!

1080
01:26:45,309 --> 01:26:47,229
Good Lord! Come on!

1081
01:26:55,349 --> 01:26:56,989
Close but no cigar!

1082
01:27:35,829 --> 01:27:39,629
- Red Rackham!
- That's right. My ancestor.

1083
01:27:39,709 --> 01:27:41,549
Just as Sir Francis was yours.

1084
01:27:41,629 --> 01:27:43,029
Unfinished business.

1085
01:27:43,109 --> 01:27:47,269
I'm glad you know the truth, Haddock.
Until you could remember,

1086
01:27:47,549 --> 01:27:50,669
killing you
wouldn't have been this much fun.

1087
01:28:15,549 --> 01:28:18,709
Who gave you permission to board my ship?

1088
01:28:18,949 --> 01:28:20,749
I don't need it.

1089
01:28:20,829 --> 01:28:22,349
I've never needed it.

1090
01:29:22,109 --> 01:29:26,229
The legend says only a Haddock
can discover the secret of the Unicorn,

1091
01:29:27,549 --> 01:29:30,629
but it took a Rackham to get the job done.

1092
01:29:30,709 --> 01:29:32,829
So you've lost again, Haddock.

1093
01:29:33,309 --> 01:29:36,429
That's right. Why don't you have a drink?

1094
01:29:36,509 --> 01:29:38,829
That's all you've got left, isn't it?

1095
01:29:38,909 --> 01:29:42,509
Everything that was rightfully yours
is now mine.

1096
01:29:42,749 --> 01:29:44,469
Including this ship.

1097
01:29:49,949 --> 01:29:54,189
Thundering typhoons.
Nobody takes my ship.

1098
01:30:13,229 --> 01:30:14,909
We have you now, you devil.

1099
01:30:15,829 --> 01:30:18,309
- You are under arrest.
- To be precise,

1100
01:30:19,309 --> 01:30:20,429
you are under arrest.

1101
01:30:34,189 --> 01:30:35,629
Do you see?

1102
01:30:38,589 --> 01:30:40,789
Blistering barnacles, they're coordinates.

1103
01:30:40,869 --> 01:30:44,909
- It took all three scrolls to form the numbers.
- Latitude and longitude.

1104
01:30:44,989 --> 01:30:48,029
That is it. That's the location of the treasure.

1105
01:30:52,189 --> 01:30:53,469
We did it!

1106
01:31:04,069 --> 01:31:07,149
Almost there, Mr. Tintin!

1107
01:31:07,229 --> 01:31:09,069
A nudge to starboard should do it.

1108
01:31:09,149 --> 01:31:12,309
- Are you sure we're on course?
- Trust me, laddie.

1109
01:31:12,389 --> 01:31:15,309
I know these parts like the back of my hand.

1110
01:31:17,149 --> 01:31:18,989
Starboard! Quickly! Quickly!

1111
01:31:19,069 --> 01:31:21,229
Aye, Captain, starboard it is!

1112
01:31:28,389 --> 01:31:30,069
All stop!

1113
01:31:35,989 --> 01:31:38,989
Marlinspike Hall.

1114
01:31:39,069 --> 01:31:41,229
Those coordinates lead here.

1115
01:31:42,029 --> 01:31:44,149
And this is where Sir Francis hid it?

1116
01:31:45,429 --> 01:31:47,749
I thought the treasure went down
with the ship.

1117
01:31:47,829 --> 01:31:51,669
Master Haddock, Mr. Tintin,
I've been expecting you.

1118
01:31:53,789 --> 01:31:56,069
Welcome to Marlinspike Hall.

1119
01:31:56,149 --> 01:31:58,069
Will you look at this place?

1120
01:31:58,149 --> 01:32:01,069
I don't think it's changed at all
since I was a wee boy.

1121
01:32:01,149 --> 01:32:03,549
And may I say, sir,
how much I'm looking forward

1122
01:32:03,629 --> 01:32:05,949
to having a Haddock
back in charge of the estate.

1123
01:32:06,029 --> 01:32:10,629
You'll be waiting a long time, Nestor.
There's no way I could afford to live here!

1124
01:32:10,709 --> 01:32:13,549
Well, Captain, you know the house.

1125
01:32:13,629 --> 01:32:15,229
Where do we start?

1126
01:32:16,109 --> 01:32:17,589
Is the cellar still here?

1127
01:32:27,229 --> 01:32:29,229
No, no, no, no, this isn't it.

1128
01:32:29,309 --> 01:32:30,389
I meant the other cellar.

1129
01:32:30,469 --> 01:32:33,229
I'm sorry, sir, there is no "other cellar."

1130
01:32:33,669 --> 01:32:35,069
It was bigger than this.

1131
01:32:35,189 --> 01:32:36,389
Snowy.

1132
01:32:37,429 --> 01:32:38,789
Snowy, where are you?

1133
01:32:39,309 --> 01:32:40,629
No, Hector.

1134
01:32:43,269 --> 01:32:44,309
Hector.

1135
01:32:44,389 --> 01:32:45,949
Captain, help me.

1136
01:32:52,029 --> 01:32:53,309
Heel, boy.

1137
01:32:56,229 --> 01:32:57,349
Snowy?

1138
01:33:00,629 --> 01:33:01,989
Just like you said, Captain.

1139
01:33:03,069 --> 01:33:04,509
You hit a wall...

1140
01:33:05,149 --> 01:33:07,229
...you push through it.

1141
01:33:11,869 --> 01:33:14,429
My grandfather must have walled it up
before he lost the house.

1142
01:33:14,509 --> 01:33:17,309
"And then shines forth the Eagle's Cross."

1143
01:33:24,189 --> 01:33:27,429
Well, I can see the cross,
but where's the eagle?

1144
01:33:27,509 --> 01:33:29,069
St. John the Evangelist,

1145
01:33:29,549 --> 01:33:31,949
who was always depicted with an eagle.

1146
01:33:32,029 --> 01:33:33,989
And he's called the Eagle of Patmos.

1147
01:33:34,589 --> 01:33:36,229
He is the eagle.

1148
01:33:38,349 --> 01:33:41,469
What's he trying to tell us, Captain?

1149
01:33:41,549 --> 01:33:42,989
I'm at a loss.

1150
01:33:43,949 --> 01:33:46,629
That island, the one in the middle,
that doesn't exist.

1151
01:33:47,109 --> 01:33:48,149
How do you know?

1152
01:33:48,229 --> 01:33:50,709
Because I've sailed those waters
countless times.

1153
01:33:50,789 --> 01:33:53,229
I've been there. It's a mistake.

1154
01:33:56,669 --> 01:33:57,989
What if it isn't?

1155
01:33:59,589 --> 01:34:03,509
Sir Francis wanted his inheritance
to go to a man who was worthy of it.

1156
01:34:04,189 --> 01:34:09,389
A man like himself, who knows the seas
like the back of his hand.

1157
01:34:09,469 --> 01:34:12,749
A man who could look at a globe

1158
01:34:12,829 --> 01:34:15,949
and tell if one tiny island

1159
01:34:16,029 --> 01:34:17,629
was out of place.

1160
01:34:30,589 --> 01:34:32,509
Blistering treasure.

1161
01:34:33,229 --> 01:34:35,869
It's Red Rackham's barnacles!

1162
01:34:41,629 --> 01:34:43,069
What is this?

1163
01:35:23,669 --> 01:35:25,549
Just a wee tipple.

1164
01:35:25,629 --> 01:35:28,549
A toast to our good fortune.

1165
01:35:30,669 --> 01:35:32,069
That's better.

1166
01:35:32,149 --> 01:35:33,549
It's odd, really. You would've thought,

1167
01:35:33,629 --> 01:35:35,749
after all the fuss and bother,
there would've been more.

1168
01:35:35,829 --> 01:35:38,269
- More of what?
- Red Rackham's treasure.

1169
01:35:38,349 --> 01:35:42,389
I mean, by your account, he looted
half of South America. I just thought...

1170
01:35:42,469 --> 01:35:45,109
Never mind. There's plenty to go around.

1171
01:35:46,589 --> 01:35:48,789
It's a funny old life, eh?

1172
01:35:48,869 --> 01:35:51,989
Well, you've got your story
for your newspaper.

1173
01:35:52,069 --> 01:35:54,029
All's well that ends well.

1174
01:35:54,109 --> 01:35:56,189
It's not ended.

1175
01:35:56,269 --> 01:35:59,269
Sir Francis left another clue
at the bottom of the globe.

1176
01:35:59,349 --> 01:36:02,869
- A clue to what?
- Four hundredweight of gold,

1177
01:36:02,949 --> 01:36:05,389
just lying at the bottom of the sea.

1178
01:36:06,109 --> 01:36:08,829
How's your thirst for adventure, Captain?

1179
01:36:10,869 --> 01:36:13,189
Unquenchable, Tintin.
