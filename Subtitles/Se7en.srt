1
00:01:38,585 --> 00:01:42,521
They were heard screaming at each
other for 2 hours. Nothing new.

2
00:01:42,589 --> 00:01:45,752
Then they heard the gun go off.
Both barrels.

3
00:01:47,027 --> 00:01:48,619
A crime of passion.

4
00:01:49,429 --> 00:01:50,521
Yeah.

5
00:01:51,031 --> 00:01:53,795
Just look at all the passion
on that wall.

6
00:01:53,867 --> 00:01:56,529
This is a done deal.
All but the paperwork.

7
00:02:00,874 --> 00:02:02,466
Did the kid see it?

8
00:02:02,542 --> 00:02:03,600
What?

9
00:02:04,211 --> 00:02:05,235
The kid?

10
00:02:06,113 --> 00:02:08,047
What kind of question's that?

11
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:13,545
We'll be real glad when we get rid of
you, Somerset. Always these questions.

12
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,318
"Did the kid see it?"
Who gives a fuck?

13
00:02:17,392 --> 00:02:19,326
He's dead.
His wife killed him.

14
00:02:19,394 --> 00:02:22,056
Anything else has nothing
to do with us.

15
00:02:31,372 --> 00:02:32,361
Detective Somerset?

16
00:02:33,975 --> 00:02:35,567
I'm Detective Mills.

17
00:02:37,812 --> 00:02:41,441
Just get in town 20 minutes ago,
they dump me here.

18
00:02:41,516 --> 00:02:42,483
Look...

19
00:02:43,084 --> 00:02:44,415
Mills?

20
00:02:44,485 --> 00:02:49,354
- Let's find a bar. Sit and talk...
- I'd like to get to the precinct.

21
00:02:49,424 --> 00:02:52,086
Not much time for
this transition thing.

22
00:02:53,594 --> 00:02:56,427
I had a question,
when we spoke on the phone.

23
00:02:56,497 --> 00:02:57,361
Yeah.

24
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,160
Why here?

25
00:03:00,935 --> 00:03:02,527
I don't follow.

26
00:03:02,603 --> 00:03:05,367
Well, all this effort
to get transferred.

27
00:03:06,507 --> 00:03:08,998
It's the first question
that popped into my head.

28
00:03:10,111 --> 00:03:14,445
Same reason as you. Or the reason
you had before you decided to quit.

29
00:03:17,118 --> 00:03:18,551
You just met me.

30
00:03:19,687 --> 00:03:22,053
Maybe I don't understand the question.

31
00:03:23,357 --> 00:03:24,881
It's very simple.

32
00:03:25,627 --> 00:03:29,290
You actually fought
to get reassigned here.

33
00:03:30,132 --> 00:03:33,727
- I never saw it done that way.
- Thought I'd do some good.

34
00:03:33,802 --> 00:03:38,239
It'd be great if we didn't start out
kicking each other in the balls.

35
00:03:40,142 --> 00:03:42,303
- You're calling the shots.
- Yes.

36
00:03:43,812 --> 00:03:47,248
I want you to look and
I want you to listen. Okay?

37
00:03:47,316 --> 00:03:51,480
I wasn't guarding a Taco Bell.
I've worked homicide 5 years.

38
00:03:51,553 --> 00:03:53,248
- Not here.
- I understand.

39
00:03:53,322 --> 00:03:57,759
Well, over the next 7 days, Detective,
do me the favor of remembering that.

40
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:18,436
SE7EN

41
00:06:58,075 --> 00:06:58,108
MONDAY

42
00:06:58,108 --> 00:07:02,011
MONDAY

43
00:07:43,054 --> 00:07:43,986
Yeah.

44
00:07:44,556 --> 00:07:45,545
Okay.

45
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:47,883
Say it again?

46
00:07:50,795 --> 00:07:54,993
I thought we moved here
to get away from tractor pulls.

47
00:08:00,071 --> 00:08:01,732
Serpico's got to go.

48
00:08:02,307 --> 00:08:05,242
Well, you might want
to get rid of this little...

49
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,904
crusty, this eye, Serpico.

50
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:09,742
- Did you get it?
- Got it.

51
00:08:09,814 --> 00:08:10,907
Good.

52
00:08:27,533 --> 00:08:28,693
Coffee?

53
00:08:33,272 --> 00:08:36,537
Nothing's been touched.
It's all like I found it.

54
00:08:36,609 --> 00:08:38,372
What time was death established?

55
00:08:38,444 --> 00:08:39,877
Like I said...

56
00:08:39,945 --> 00:08:41,537
I didn't touch anything...

57
00:08:42,114 --> 00:08:45,709
but he's had his face
in spaghetti for 45 minutes.

58
00:08:45,785 --> 00:08:48,549
Wait. No one bothers
with vital signs?

59
00:08:48,621 --> 00:08:53,490
Did I suffer? This guy ain't breathing
unless he's breathing spaghetti sauce.

60
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:56,824
- That's how it's done here?
- Excuse me, Detective.

61
00:08:56,896 --> 00:09:01,731
He's sitting in his own piss and shit.
If he wasn't dead he would've stood up

62
00:09:02,134 --> 00:09:04,159
- Alright.
- Thank you, Officer.

63
00:09:04,904 --> 00:09:06,166
Thank you.

64
00:09:15,981 --> 00:09:17,039
I wonder.

65
00:09:19,652 --> 00:09:23,680
What was the point of the conversation
you were about to get into?

66
00:09:24,091 --> 00:09:28,585
Don't know. How many times Barney Five
found dead bodies that weren't dead.

67
00:09:30,831 --> 00:09:31,923
Drop it.

68
00:10:02,195 --> 00:10:05,790
Somebody phone Guiness.
I think we've got a record here.

69
00:10:22,482 --> 00:10:24,473
Better Homes and Gardens.

70
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:33,283
Spaghetti Sauce

71
00:10:35,496 --> 00:10:37,054
Who said this was murder?

72
00:10:37,565 --> 00:10:38,759
No one.

73
00:10:40,735 --> 00:10:42,498
Guy's heart must be the size...

74
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:43,935
of a canned ham.

75
00:10:47,008 --> 00:10:49,169
If this isn't a coronary...

76
00:10:49,243 --> 00:10:50,335
well...

77
00:10:51,078 --> 00:10:52,443
I don't know.

78
00:11:09,597 --> 00:11:10,859
Whoops.

79
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:19,870
How about that.

80
00:11:29,951 --> 00:11:31,942
We had this case once...

81
00:11:32,887 --> 00:11:34,878
guy dead on the ground...

82
00:11:34,956 --> 00:11:36,787
knife in his back.
Murder...

83
00:11:36,857 --> 00:11:38,154
right?

84
00:11:40,228 --> 00:11:41,320
Fuck!

85
00:11:41,963 --> 00:11:45,559
Anyway, big insurance policy involved,
yeah? So the guy...

86
00:11:45,634 --> 00:11:47,124
took the tip of the blade...

87
00:11:47,202 --> 00:11:49,602
stuck it in his own shoulder blades.

88
00:11:49,671 --> 00:11:52,697
He must've screwed up
'cause there was...

89
00:11:52,774 --> 00:11:54,605
- multiples back there.
- Please be quiet.

90
00:12:04,853 --> 00:12:06,115
Wait a minute.

91
00:12:06,188 --> 00:12:07,212
What?

92
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:11,550
Got a bucket here.

93
00:12:12,661 --> 00:12:13,753
What's in it?

94
00:12:19,635 --> 00:12:20,795
Oh God!

95
00:12:20,869 --> 00:12:22,461
Fucking vomit.

96
00:12:24,806 --> 00:12:26,103
Any blood in it?

97
00:12:26,642 --> 00:12:29,076
I didn't see any.
Help yourself.

98
00:12:34,349 --> 00:12:36,317
Are you thinking it's poison?

99
00:12:37,552 --> 00:12:40,077
Oh, wonderful. Very moody.

100
00:12:40,155 --> 00:12:41,816
Think it's poison, Somerset?

101
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:44,984
You girls have got forensics
waiting outside.

102
00:12:45,327 --> 00:12:46,589
We might not fit.

103
00:12:46,662 --> 00:12:49,153
There's room. Light's the problem.

104
00:12:49,231 --> 00:12:50,528
How are you?

105
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,827
Det. Mills, go help the officers...

106
00:12:53,902 --> 00:12:55,427
question the neighbors.

107
00:12:58,174 --> 00:12:59,334
What?

108
00:12:59,409 --> 00:13:01,138
And send in forensics.

109
00:13:16,859 --> 00:13:18,190
He's dead.

110
00:13:19,696 --> 00:13:21,129
Thank you, Doctor.

111
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:29,704
You saw my files,
the things I've done?

112
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,029
Nope.

113
00:13:34,777 --> 00:13:38,304
I did door-to-doors and walked
the beat. I did that shit...

114
00:13:38,381 --> 00:13:39,473
a long time.

115
00:13:40,717 --> 00:13:42,378
- And?
- My badge says...

116
00:13:42,452 --> 00:13:45,353
"detective".
That's the same as yours.

117
00:13:46,622 --> 00:13:48,715
Look, I made a decision.

118
00:13:49,392 --> 00:13:52,156
I had to consider
the integrity of the scene...

119
00:13:52,228 --> 00:13:55,823
not whether you were getting
enough time on the field.

120
00:13:55,898 --> 00:13:56,990
Hey, man...

121
00:13:58,801 --> 00:14:02,396
Just don't jerk me off. That's all
I ask. Don't jerk me off.

122
00:14:08,812 --> 00:14:10,177
He's been dead...

123
00:14:10,247 --> 00:14:12,909
a long time, and not from poison.

124
00:14:12,983 --> 00:14:14,416
Oh, man.

125
00:14:14,485 --> 00:14:16,578
How can you let yourself go like that?

126
00:14:17,154 --> 00:14:20,021
It took 4 orderlies just
to get him on the table.

127
00:14:22,993 --> 00:14:27,930
- How'd the fat fuck fit out his door?
- Please. Obviously he was a shut-in.

128
00:14:27,998 --> 00:14:31,092
Look. See how big this stomach is?

129
00:14:31,168 --> 00:14:34,035
And the strange thing is,
it stretches.

130
00:14:34,104 --> 00:14:37,267
Look at the size of the
cardiac orifice, where the food...

131
00:14:37,341 --> 00:14:40,105
I see that, but it means
nothing to me.

132
00:14:40,177 --> 00:14:42,702
Okay, he's got lines of distention...

133
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,372
across the duodenum.

134
00:14:44,448 --> 00:14:46,075
The interior wall's ripped open.

135
00:14:47,684 --> 00:14:50,209
This man ate till he burst?

136
00:14:50,287 --> 00:14:55,224
He didn't really burst. Not all the
way. He was hemorrhaging internally.

137
00:14:55,292 --> 00:14:58,125
There was a hematoma
in the rectus and...

138
00:14:58,195 --> 00:15:01,392
- the transverse abdominous muscles.
- He did die by eating?

139
00:15:01,465 --> 00:15:02,625
Yes and no.

140
00:15:04,868 --> 00:15:06,699
What about these bruises here?

141
00:15:08,472 --> 00:15:10,463
I haven't figured that out yet.

142
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,475
Gun pressed against his head?

143
00:15:12,543 --> 00:15:13,976
Pressed hard enough.

144
00:15:14,044 --> 00:15:15,238
Fuck, yeah.

145
00:15:15,646 --> 00:15:18,241
On the front, flush with the muzzle.

146
00:15:20,385 --> 00:15:23,821
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have ourselves a homicide.

147
00:15:26,658 --> 00:15:31,254
Killer put a bucket beneath him,
kept on serving. Took his time too.

148
00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:34,264
Coroner said it could have lasted
more than 12 hours.

149
00:15:34,332 --> 00:15:37,665
Victim's throat was swollen,
probably from the effort...

150
00:15:37,735 --> 00:15:40,602
and there was a point
when he passed out.

151
00:15:40,672 --> 00:15:42,833
That's when the killer kicked him...

152
00:15:42,907 --> 00:15:44,841
- and he burst.
- Sadistic fucker.

153
00:15:45,343 --> 00:15:48,176
When you want somebody dead,
you drive by and shoot.

154
00:15:48,246 --> 00:15:51,113
You don't risk the time
it takes to do this...

155
00:15:51,182 --> 00:15:54,117
- unless the act itself has meaning.
- Come on.

156
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:58,989
Somebody had a problem with a fat boy
and tortured him. Simple as that.

157
00:15:59,057 --> 00:16:00,319
In the grocery bags...

158
00:16:00,391 --> 00:16:03,918
we found 2 receipts. So,
the killer stopped and went back...

159
00:16:03,995 --> 00:16:05,519
to the supermarket.

160
00:16:06,264 --> 00:16:07,424
So?

161
00:16:08,933 --> 00:16:12,300
Man, it's his thing.
I've been out in the rain all day.

162
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:14,361
- This is beginning.
- We've got...

163
00:16:14,439 --> 00:16:16,304
one dead guy, not three.

164
00:16:16,374 --> 00:16:17,534
No motive.

165
00:16:18,543 --> 00:16:21,137
Don't start that big brain of yours...

166
00:16:21,212 --> 00:16:22,804
cooking on this, alright?

167
00:16:23,281 --> 00:16:25,215
I'd like to be reassigned.

168
00:16:26,451 --> 00:16:27,543
Whoa.

169
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:29,884
What are you talking about?

170
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:31,889
This can't be my last duty.

171
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:33,619
It'll go on and on.

172
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:36,720
You're retiring in 6 days.

173
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:39,821
You've left unfinished
business before.

174
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:43,892
Those cases were taken as close
to conclusion as possible.

175
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:47,171
- And if I may speak freely?
- We're friends here.

176
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:49,002
It's his first assignment.

177
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:53,067
I knew it. This is not
my first assignment, you dick.

178
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:54,339
It's too soon.

179
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:57,746
I'm here. You can say that
shit to my face. Captain?

180
00:16:57,816 --> 00:16:59,010
It's too soon for you.

181
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:01,074
Captain...

182
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:03,246
Can we talk in private?

183
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:04,755
This is a personal thing--

184
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:06,590
Just shut up, Mills.

185
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:08,524
I don't have anyone else...

186
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:11,927
to put on this and you know it.
This is Metro...

187
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:14,898
- you don't just get to swap.
- Give it to me.

188
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:19,533
He wants out, fuck him.
See you, have a nice time.

189
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:20,867
Give it to me.

190
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,908
I'll put you on something else.

191
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:27,741
Go on, Mills, just go on.

192
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:37,051
I'm sorry, old buddy,
but it looks like you're stuck...

193
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:38,885
cleaning up the fat man.

194
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:46,333
TUESDAY

195
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:49,496
TUESDAY

196
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:54,202
MURDER HAS A NEW UPTOWN ADDRESS!

197
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:56,105
ATTORNEY FOUND MURDERED

198
00:17:57,177 --> 00:17:58,701
Quiet down.

199
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,045
Alright, calm down. Calm down.

200
00:18:02,616 --> 00:18:04,106
Quiet down.

201
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:09,220
Here's how it'll work:

202
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:13,384
I'll answer questions for 10 minutes
and 10 minutes only.

203
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,795
Ask those questions in a calm, sane,
orderly fashion or I will leave.

204
00:18:18,865 --> 00:18:20,730
Detective? Detective?

205
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,734
- Can I have a moment?
- No.

206
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:32,638
I won't discuss the details of this
investigation, so don't bother asking.

207
00:18:51,832 --> 00:18:53,493
What you got for me?

208
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,091
Nothing yet, boss.

209
00:18:58,406 --> 00:19:01,569
Why don't you guys go get
a coffee, huh?

210
00:19:03,077 --> 00:19:07,275
We have this breaking story.
Let's go downtown where attorney...

211
00:19:07,348 --> 00:19:09,942
Eli Gould was found murdered today.

212
00:19:10,017 --> 00:19:14,454
District Attorney Martin Talbot
is taking questions from reporters.

213
00:19:18,693 --> 00:19:20,957
That's ridiculous and offensive.

214
00:19:21,028 --> 00:19:25,863
There is no conflict, and any claim
there could be is irresponsible.

215
00:19:27,201 --> 00:19:28,463
Now hold on.

216
00:19:30,037 --> 00:19:33,871
I just met with law enforcement
officials and they...

217
00:19:33,941 --> 00:19:38,173
assured me that they have their
very best men on this.

218
00:19:38,612 --> 00:19:41,206
This will be the very definition...

219
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,983
of swift justice.

220
00:19:46,287 --> 00:19:48,221
GREED

221
00:20:07,743 --> 00:20:09,335
Pardon me, George.

222
00:20:13,815 --> 00:20:14,839
Somerset.

223
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,076
Come in.

224
00:20:17,419 --> 00:20:18,852
You heard the news?

225
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,353
Nope, haven't heard.

226
00:20:20,422 --> 00:20:23,255
Eli Gould was found
murdered this morning.

227
00:20:23,325 --> 00:20:26,761
Someone broke into his law firm
and bled him to death.

228
00:20:27,662 --> 00:20:29,857
Wrote the word "greed"
on the floor.

229
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:38,468
- Greed?
- Yeah, in blood.

230
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,906
Mills is heading the investigation.

231
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,477
Excuse me. Excuse me.

232
00:20:44,746 --> 00:20:45,940
Don't do that, please?

233
00:20:49,184 --> 00:20:51,015
Good for him.

234
00:20:51,086 --> 00:20:52,519
What will you do...

235
00:20:52,587 --> 00:20:54,680
with yourself out there, Somerset?

236
00:20:54,756 --> 00:20:58,021
Oh, I'll work, maybe on a farm.
Fix my house.

237
00:20:58,093 --> 00:20:59,526
Don't you feel it?

238
00:21:00,028 --> 00:21:01,791
Don't you feel that feeling?

239
00:21:02,597 --> 00:21:05,191
You're not going to be a cop anymore.

240
00:21:05,267 --> 00:21:07,030
That's the whole idea.

241
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,203
I don't think you'll leave.

242
00:21:11,072 --> 00:21:13,132
Hell, you can't leave all this.

243
00:21:15,545 --> 00:21:17,536
Guy's out walking his dog.

244
00:21:17,613 --> 00:21:19,137
Gets attacked.

245
00:21:19,549 --> 00:21:22,143
His watch is taken, his wallet.

246
00:21:22,218 --> 00:21:23,549
And while he's lying...

247
00:21:23,619 --> 00:21:25,211
on the sidewalk helpless...

248
00:21:25,955 --> 00:21:28,719
his attacker stabs him in both eyes.

249
00:21:30,293 --> 00:21:33,091
This happened last night
about 4 blocks from here.

250
00:21:33,963 --> 00:21:35,021
I read about it.

251
00:21:35,965 --> 00:21:37,865
I don't understand anymore.

252
00:21:38,301 --> 00:21:40,132
It's the way it's always been.

253
00:21:40,203 --> 00:21:44,071
- Maybe you're right.
- This work is what you're made for.

254
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,233
I don't think you can deny that.

255
00:21:47,376 --> 00:21:48,900
Maybe I'm wrong.

256
00:21:51,214 --> 00:21:53,478
The coroner sent this down for you.

257
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:56,584
Found them in
the fat boy's stomach...

258
00:21:56,986 --> 00:22:00,422
mixed in with the food.
Looks like little pieces of...

259
00:22:00,489 --> 00:22:02,252
- plastic.
- Set them on that desk.

260
00:22:06,562 --> 00:22:08,086
They were...

261
00:22:08,164 --> 00:22:09,392
fed to him.

262
00:23:48,933 --> 00:23:49,922
Lord.

263
00:23:50,001 --> 00:23:51,764
GLUTTONY

264
00:23:58,276 --> 00:24:02,713
This was found behind the refrigerator
in the obesity murder scene.

265
00:24:04,015 --> 00:24:05,710
"Long is the way

266
00:24:05,783 --> 00:24:09,048
And hard, that out of hell
leads up to light."

267
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,382
It's from Milton.

268
00:24:11,089 --> 00:24:12,556
"Paradise Lost."

269
00:24:13,124 --> 00:24:14,113
Alright...

270
00:24:14,192 --> 00:24:15,386
I'm confused.

271
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,894
It means that this is beginning.

272
00:24:17,962 --> 00:24:19,224
GLUTTONY

273
00:24:19,297 --> 00:24:21,390
This was behind
the same refrigerator...

274
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:23,790
written in grease.

275
00:24:23,868 --> 00:24:25,961
There are 7 deadly sins, Captain.

276
00:24:26,537 --> 00:24:27,799
Gluttony...

277
00:24:30,475 --> 00:24:31,464
greed...

278
00:24:33,878 --> 00:24:36,073
sloth, wrath...

279
00:24:36,147 --> 00:24:38,274
pride, lust...

280
00:24:38,883 --> 00:24:40,077
and envy.

281
00:24:40,585 --> 00:24:41,643
Seven.

282
00:24:41,719 --> 00:24:42,651
Hold on.

283
00:24:43,221 --> 00:24:45,553
This is not even my desk.

284
00:24:46,458 --> 00:24:48,722
You can expect five more of these.

285
00:24:50,329 --> 00:24:51,557
Wait a minute.

286
00:24:52,898 --> 00:24:54,991
I can't get involved in this.

287
00:24:57,202 --> 00:24:58,430
Somerset.

288
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:00,266
He wanted it.

289
00:25:01,907 --> 00:25:03,101
Damn!

290
00:25:03,175 --> 00:25:04,665
I'm all over it.

291
00:25:39,178 --> 00:25:40,145
Where to?

292
00:25:43,382 --> 00:25:45,316
Far away from here.

293
00:25:57,363 --> 00:25:59,888
- Just a few things to look up.
- Okay.

294
00:25:59,966 --> 00:26:01,661
Sit where you'd like.

295
00:26:02,469 --> 00:26:03,766
How's everybody?

296
00:26:04,804 --> 00:26:06,328
Hiya, Smiley.

297
00:26:07,073 --> 00:26:09,268
George, the cards are getting cold.

298
00:26:09,909 --> 00:26:11,171
Duty calls.

299
00:26:27,093 --> 00:26:28,754
Gentlemen? Gentlemen...

300
00:26:29,496 --> 00:26:30,963
I'll never understand.

301
00:26:32,265 --> 00:26:34,028
All these books...

302
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,534
a world of knowledge right here...

303
00:26:36,603 --> 00:26:37,763
and what do you do?

304
00:26:38,605 --> 00:26:40,095
You play poker all night.

305
00:26:40,607 --> 00:26:42,541
Hey, we got culture.

306
00:26:42,609 --> 00:26:45,203
Yeah, we got culture
coming out of our asses.

307
00:26:48,681 --> 00:26:50,444
How's this for culture?

308
00:27:19,446 --> 00:27:21,277
CHAUCER

You may want to check these books re:
deadly sins.

312
00:28:39,327 --> 00:28:41,852
Dante's Purgatory
The Canterbury Tales

313
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:54,765
was crimson with his blood:

314
00:29:05,787 --> 00:29:07,880
Even children slain!

315
00:29:28,543 --> 00:29:29,805
You know, Smiley...

316
00:29:30,646 --> 00:29:32,580
you'll really miss us.

317
00:29:34,383 --> 00:29:35,816
I just might.

318

Fucking Dante.

323
00:30:35,878 --> 00:30:39,939
Goddamn poetry-writing fatggot
piece of shit.

324
00:30:40,483 --> 00:30:41,541
Fucker.

325
00:30:52,729 --> 00:30:54,219
Good work, Officer.

326
00:31:01,238 --> 00:31:03,001
Thank you, Lord.

327
00:31:10,981 --> 00:31:12,505
Oh, oh, sorry.

328
00:31:14,084 --> 00:31:15,915
I'll move in a second.

329
00:31:28,432 --> 00:31:31,026
- You want your chair?
- You go ahead.

330
00:31:31,101 --> 00:31:31,931
Yeah?

331
00:32:10,808 --> 00:32:11,604
Phone.

332
00:32:12,777 --> 00:32:15,245
Package deal.
Comes with the office.

333
00:32:20,384 --> 00:32:21,408
Mills.

334
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,312
Honey...

335
00:32:23,387 --> 00:32:25,252
You okay? Something wrong?

336
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:30,122
You dingleberry, I told you
not to call me here when I'm working.

337
00:32:31,329 --> 00:32:32,762
Yeah. Why?

338
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:36,832
Why?

339
00:32:41,572 --> 00:32:42,834
Okay.

340
00:32:46,744 --> 00:32:47,938
It's my wife.

341
00:32:48,346 --> 00:32:49,472
Sorry?

342
00:32:50,748 --> 00:32:52,409
She'd like to speak to you.

343
00:33:02,527 --> 00:33:04,359
This is Detective Somerset.

344
00:33:06,365 --> 00:33:09,129
Well, yes, it's nice
to talk to you too.

345
00:33:10,769 --> 00:33:13,135
I appreciate the offer, but...

346
00:33:15,707 --> 00:33:17,971
Well, in that case I'd be delighted.

347
00:33:18,944 --> 00:33:20,878
Yes, thank you very much.

348
00:33:22,114 --> 00:33:23,206
Bye.

349
00:33:25,951 --> 00:33:27,213
Honey, what...?

350
00:33:35,227 --> 00:33:36,660
Well?

351
00:33:36,728 --> 00:33:38,025
Sorry?

352
00:33:39,398 --> 00:33:43,732
I'm invited to late supper
at your apartment. I accepted.

353
00:33:43,802 --> 00:33:45,633
At my... How's that?

354
00:33:46,305 --> 00:33:47,237
Tonight.

355
00:33:54,313 --> 00:33:56,247
Hello, men.

356
00:33:56,315 --> 00:33:57,577
- Hi, loser.
- Hi, idiot.

357
00:34:00,452 --> 00:34:01,817
That's Tracy. Tracy...

358
00:34:03,589 --> 00:34:04,681
Hello.

359
00:34:05,157 --> 00:34:07,557
Glad to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.

360
00:34:08,827 --> 00:34:10,818
Except your first name.

361
00:34:12,097 --> 00:34:13,428
It's William.

362
00:34:14,166 --> 00:34:16,431
Well, it's a good name...

363
00:34:16,502 --> 00:34:17,526
William.

364
00:34:18,271 --> 00:34:20,432
William, I'd like you to meet David.

365
00:34:20,506 --> 00:34:24,442
- David, this is William.
- Alright, I'll be right back.

366
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:27,707
- How are the kids?
- Good. They're in the room. Come in.

367
00:34:29,515 --> 00:34:31,278
Aw, good dogs.

368
00:34:31,351 --> 00:34:34,286
How are all the good dogs?
How are you, pretty?

369
00:34:45,298 --> 00:34:46,890
Smells good.

370
00:34:48,935 --> 00:34:51,233
Yeah, I mean, thank you.

371
00:34:51,971 --> 00:34:54,235
Please have a seat, if you like.

372
00:34:54,307 --> 00:34:58,300
- Would you like a drink?
- No. Thanks. I'll wait.

373
00:34:59,045 --> 00:35:02,242
Throw that anywhere.
Excuse all this mess.

374
00:35:02,315 --> 00:35:03,976
We're still unpacking.

375
00:35:06,552 --> 00:35:09,146
I hear you were
high school sweethearts.

376
00:35:11,557 --> 00:35:13,149
Pretty hokey, huh?

377
00:35:14,394 --> 00:35:15,827
You know something?

378
00:35:16,396 --> 00:35:18,921
On our first date I knew he was...

379
00:35:18,998 --> 00:35:20,488
- the guy I'd marry.
- Really?

380
00:35:22,001 --> 00:35:24,333
He was the funniest guy I ever met.

381
00:35:29,076 --> 00:35:30,236
Really.

382
00:35:33,347 --> 00:35:35,781
It's kind of rare nowadays.

383
00:35:35,849 --> 00:35:38,113
I mean, that level of...

384
00:35:38,185 --> 00:35:39,277
commitment.

385
00:35:44,091 --> 00:35:45,524
Oh, don't worry.

386
00:35:46,093 --> 00:35:48,357
I won't wear it to the dinner table.

387
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,292
No matter...

388
00:35:51,365 --> 00:35:54,027
how often I see guns,
I just can't...

389
00:35:54,101 --> 00:35:55,534
get used to them.

390
00:35:56,603 --> 00:35:57,831
Same here.

391
00:36:08,148 --> 00:36:10,810
- Why aren't you married, William?
- Tracy.

392
00:36:10,884 --> 00:36:12,146
What the hell?

393
00:36:12,219 --> 00:36:13,914
I was close once.

394
00:36:14,988 --> 00:36:16,250
It just didn't happen.

395
00:36:16,323 --> 00:36:18,257
It surprises me.

396
00:36:18,892 --> 00:36:20,416
It really does.

397
00:36:21,829 --> 00:36:22,853
Well...

398
00:36:24,331 --> 00:36:28,495
Anyone who spends a significant amount
of time with me finds me disagreeable.

399
00:36:29,403 --> 00:36:30,836
Just ask your husband.

400
00:36:30,904 --> 00:36:31,996
Very true.

401
00:36:32,339 --> 00:36:34,170
Very, very true.

402
00:36:34,908 --> 00:36:37,001
How long have you lived here?

403
00:36:37,846 --> 00:36:38,938
Too long.

404
00:36:42,917 --> 00:36:44,248
How do you like it?

405
00:36:46,187 --> 00:36:47,347
You know...

406
00:36:47,856 --> 00:36:50,188
takes time. Settle in...

407
00:36:51,426 --> 00:36:52,916
it'll be good.

408
00:36:52,994 --> 00:36:55,121
Well, you get numb after awhile

409
00:36:56,598 --> 00:36:58,532
There are things to any city...

410
00:37:04,272 --> 00:37:05,466
Subway.

411
00:37:05,874 --> 00:37:07,967
It'll go away in a minute.

412
00:37:11,713 --> 00:37:13,374
This real estate guy.

413
00:37:14,048 --> 00:37:16,642
Fucking piece of...
Sorry, honey.

414
00:37:17,552 --> 00:37:20,817
He shows us the place a few times,
I think he's good.

415
00:37:20,889 --> 00:37:23,551
He's efficient.
Tracy really likes him.

416
00:37:23,958 --> 00:37:28,327
Then I start wondering why he'll only
bring us here 5 minutes at a time.

417
00:37:28,396 --> 00:37:30,296
We found out the first night.

418
00:37:30,732 --> 00:37:33,064
The soothing, relaxing...

419
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:35,399
vibrating home, huh?

420
00:37:43,912 --> 00:37:45,243
I'm sorry.

421
00:37:52,421 --> 00:37:54,355
Yeah, alright, laugh it up.

422
00:37:57,092 --> 00:37:59,492
I don't know why you're laughing.

423
00:38:03,332 --> 00:38:05,027
Alright, already.

424
00:38:09,104 --> 00:38:11,265
He had to get into the building...

425
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:15,367
before the office closed.
Gould would have been working late?

426
00:38:15,444 --> 00:38:18,675
I'm certain. He was the biggest
defense lawyer in town.

427
00:38:18,747 --> 00:38:22,114
- Infamous, really.
- Body was found on Tuesday morning.

428
00:38:22,184 --> 00:38:26,621
The office was closed on Monday.
So he could have gotten in on Friday.

429
00:38:26,689 --> 00:38:29,749
Laid low till the cleaning crew left,
then had...

430
00:38:29,825 --> 00:38:33,283
his way with Gould Saturday, Sunday,
maybe Monday.

431
00:38:33,796 --> 00:38:34,626
Look.

432
00:38:35,698 --> 00:38:37,495
Gould was bound, right arm free.

433
00:38:37,566 --> 00:38:39,727
He was handed a butcher's knife.

434
00:38:41,704 --> 00:38:43,604
Check out the scale.

435
00:38:43,672 --> 00:38:44,934
A pound of flesh.

436
00:38:51,714 --> 00:38:53,147
"One pound of flesh"

437
00:38:53,215 --> 00:38:55,706
"No more no less
No cartilage...

438
00:38:55,784 --> 00:38:56,978
No bone....

439
00:38:57,052 --> 00:38:59,418
only flesh". "Merchant of Venice."

440
00:38:59,488 --> 00:39:00,820
Didn't see it.

441
00:39:00,891 --> 00:39:03,951
"This task done...
And he would Go Free".

442
00:39:04,527 --> 00:39:06,154
I tell you that chair was...

443
00:39:06,229 --> 00:39:08,925
- soaked through with sweat.
- Of course.

444
00:39:09,566 --> 00:39:12,330
The killer wanted Gould
to take his time...

445
00:39:12,836 --> 00:39:14,827
deciding which cut....

446
00:39:14,905 --> 00:39:16,099
to make first.

447
00:39:16,706 --> 00:39:18,105
Imagine it.

448
00:39:18,174 --> 00:39:20,005
There's a gun in your face.

449
00:39:20,677 --> 00:39:22,975
Which part of your body
is expendable?

450
00:39:23,613 --> 00:39:25,342
The love handle.

451
00:39:25,849 --> 00:39:28,443
Cut along the side
of his own stomach.

452
00:39:28,919 --> 00:39:33,151
Let's take a fresh look at these.
The corpse is there, but...

453
00:39:33,223 --> 00:39:36,681
Iook through it.
Edit out your initial shock.

454
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:41,788
The trick is to find one item,
one detail and focus on it...

455
00:39:41,865 --> 00:39:44,299
until it's an exhausted possibility.

456
00:39:44,367 --> 00:39:46,335
I'll get another beer. Beer?

457
00:39:46,403 --> 00:39:48,200
Wine, please.

458
00:39:57,113 --> 00:39:58,478
He's preaching.

459
00:39:59,115 --> 00:40:00,377
Punishing.

460
00:40:02,385 --> 00:40:05,377
The sins were used
in medieval sermons.

461
00:40:06,222 --> 00:40:08,349
7 cardinal virtues,
7 deadly sins...

462
00:40:08,425 --> 00:40:11,691
- used as teaching tools.
- Yeah. Like in...

463
00:40:11,762 --> 00:40:15,459
- "The Parson's Tale," and Dante.
- You read them?

464
00:40:15,533 --> 00:40:16,659
Yeah.

465
00:40:16,734 --> 00:40:19,202
Parts. Remember in "Purgatory"...

466
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:23,764
Dante and his buddy climb up the hill
and check out all the sinners?

467
00:40:24,942 --> 00:40:28,605
- The Seven Terraces of Purgation.
- Yeah, right.

468
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:32,046
But there pride comes first,
not gluttony.

469
00:40:32,116 --> 00:40:33,606
For now let's consider...

470
00:40:33,684 --> 00:40:36,676
the books as the killer's inspiration.

471
00:40:36,754 --> 00:40:39,723
The sermons were about atonement
for sin.

472
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:42,224
These murders are like
forced attrition.

473
00:40:42,293 --> 00:40:43,783
Forced what?

474
00:40:43,861 --> 00:40:47,058
Attrition's when you regret your sins,
but not because...

475
00:40:47,131 --> 00:40:51,033
- you love God.
- Because there's a gun in your face.

476
00:40:54,872 --> 00:40:56,066
No fingerprints.

477
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,573
Nope.

478
00:40:57,641 --> 00:41:00,735
- Totally unrelated victims.
- Yep.

479
00:41:00,811 --> 00:41:03,575
And no witnesses of any kind.

480
00:41:03,647 --> 00:41:05,308
Which I don't get...

481
00:41:05,383 --> 00:41:08,318
because the fucker
had to get back out.

482
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:13,486
In any major city, minding
your own business is a science.

483
00:41:14,258 --> 00:41:17,785
In rape prevention, the first thing
they teach you is never cry for help.

484
00:41:18,596 --> 00:41:20,257
Always yell, "Fire!".

485
00:41:20,331 --> 00:41:21,764
Nobody answers help.

486
00:41:21,832 --> 00:41:23,858
Holler "fire," they'll come.

487
00:41:23,935 --> 00:41:25,664
That's fucked up.

488
00:41:25,737 --> 00:41:28,501
He must have left
another puzzle piece.

489
00:41:30,575 --> 00:41:34,841
You know what? Thank you for talking
this out, but I must sleep.

490
00:41:35,247 --> 00:41:36,509
Walk the dogs.

491
00:41:36,581 --> 00:41:39,106
This is just to satisfy my curiosity.

492
00:41:39,184 --> 00:41:43,177
- I'm leaving at the end of the week.
- Shit. No, wait.

493
00:41:44,756 --> 00:41:47,782
Gould's wife. She was out of town
at the time.

494
00:41:47,859 --> 00:41:51,192
- So this means she saw something.
- What if it's a threat?

495
00:41:51,263 --> 00:41:55,290
I put her in a safe house.
She wasn't too happy about it.

496
00:42:03,175 --> 00:42:05,803
What if it isn't what she has seen...

497
00:42:05,877 --> 00:42:10,109
but what she's supposed to see
but hasn't had the chance?

498
00:42:10,182 --> 00:42:11,979
Yeah, okay. What?

499
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:13,540
I don't know.

500
00:42:15,387 --> 00:42:17,321
But that's the one thing.

501
00:43:02,768 --> 00:43:04,099
I'll sign us in.

502
00:43:04,604 --> 00:43:06,094
Must see Mrs. Gould.

503
00:43:12,845 --> 00:43:14,210
Mrs. Gould?

504
00:43:20,353 --> 00:43:22,913
Mrs. Gould, I'm sorry.
I truly am.

505
00:43:23,623 --> 00:43:25,420
I don't understand.

506
00:43:25,858 --> 00:43:28,486
I need you to look at each photo...

507
00:43:28,995 --> 00:43:30,622
very carefully.

508
00:43:30,696 --> 00:43:34,291
Look and see if there's anything
strange or...

509
00:43:34,367 --> 00:43:36,961
out of place, anything at all.

510
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:39,235
I don't see anything.

511
00:43:40,206 --> 00:43:42,800
Please, I can't do this right now.

512
00:43:42,875 --> 00:43:43,967
Okay.

513
00:43:45,145 --> 00:43:46,635
It's got to be now.

514
00:43:46,713 --> 00:43:48,647
There may be something we missed.

515
00:43:58,225 --> 00:43:59,419
Wait.

516
00:43:59,493 --> 00:44:00,460
What?

517
00:44:00,527 --> 00:44:01,585
Here.

518
00:44:05,065 --> 00:44:08,159
This painting, it's upside down.

519
00:44:15,909 --> 00:44:18,002
- Your men didn't move this?
- No.

520
00:44:18,078 --> 00:44:20,444
Those shots were taken
before forensics.

521
00:44:23,917 --> 00:44:25,009
Nothing.

522
00:44:26,253 --> 00:44:28,278
There's got to be something.

523
00:44:39,199 --> 00:44:41,861
- He moved the screws to rehang it.
- Yep.

524
00:44:46,206 --> 00:44:47,798
What the fuck is that?

525
00:44:49,276 --> 00:44:50,709
Switchblade.

526
00:44:58,886 --> 00:45:00,649
Goddamn it.

527
00:45:03,958 --> 00:45:06,392
There must be something.

528
00:45:11,566 --> 00:45:13,659
He didn't paint the fucking thing.

529
00:45:21,576 --> 00:45:24,545
No, he's fucking with us,
that's what he's doing.

530
00:45:25,747 --> 00:45:27,977
See this, this is us.

531
00:45:29,751 --> 00:45:31,412
Just wait a minute.

532
00:45:34,222 --> 00:45:37,521
- Somerset's climbing on the furniture.
- Wait a minute.

533
00:45:43,097 --> 00:45:44,962
You're kidding me.

534
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:47,024
Call the print lab.

535
00:45:52,273 --> 00:45:53,604
Oh, man.

536
00:45:57,111 --> 00:45:58,544
Honestly...

537
00:45:58,613 --> 00:46:01,207
have you ever seen anything like this?

538
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:06,979
HELP ME

539
00:46:07,056 --> 00:46:09,991
The swell pattern tells me
that they're not...

540
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:12,323
the victim's fingerprints.

541
00:46:22,671 --> 00:46:24,571
I don't know, man.

542
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,767
I say he's whacked enough.

543
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:29,704
It doesn't fit.

544
00:46:30,512 --> 00:46:32,173
He doesn't want to stop.

545
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:33,339
Who knows.

546
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:37,579
Freaks out there doing their
evil deeds they don't want to do.

547
00:46:37,653 --> 00:46:40,178
"The voices made me do it".

548
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:42,189
"Jodie Foster made me do it".

549
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:43,724
It can take...

550
00:46:43,792 --> 00:46:47,888
3 days to make a match,
so maybe you guys want to cross...

551
00:46:47,963 --> 00:46:49,692
your fingers somewhere else.

552
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:56,203
You meant what you said to Mrs. Gould,
didn't you?

553
00:46:56,271 --> 00:46:58,034
About catching this guy.

554
00:47:01,543 --> 00:47:04,137
Wish I still thought
the way you did.

555
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:08,981
Tell me what the hell it is
you think we're doing?

556
00:47:09,885 --> 00:47:11,750
Picking up the pieces.

557
00:47:13,255 --> 00:47:18,159
We're collecting all the evidence,
taking all the pictures and samples...

558
00:47:18,228 --> 00:47:20,321
writing everything down...

559
00:47:20,397 --> 00:47:22,729
noting the time things happened.

560
00:47:24,067 --> 00:47:25,159
That's all?

561
00:47:25,769 --> 00:47:27,327
That's all.

562
00:47:27,404 --> 00:47:31,170
Putting everything into neat piles
and filing it away...

563
00:47:31,741 --> 00:47:35,233
on the off chance it'll be needed
in the courtroom.

564
00:47:37,914 --> 00:47:41,179
Picking up diamonds
on a deserted island...

565
00:47:41,251 --> 00:47:44,414
saving them in case we get rescued.

566
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:48,514
Bullshit.

567
00:47:51,261 --> 00:47:55,061
Even the most promising clues
usually only lead to others.

568
00:47:56,466 --> 00:47:59,867
So many corpses roll away unrevenged.

569
00:48:02,839 --> 00:48:06,434
Don't try to tell me you didn't
get that rush tonight.

570
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:09,043
I saw you.

571
00:48:09,946 --> 00:48:11,937
We're getting somewhere.

572
00:48:22,091 --> 00:48:22,125
THURSDAY

573
00:48:22,125 --> 00:48:24,685
THURSDAY

574
00:48:27,464 --> 00:48:29,126
Wake up, Glimmer Twins.

575
00:48:29,467 --> 00:48:31,059
We got a winner.

576
00:48:37,274 --> 00:48:41,040
He uses the name Victor.
His real name is Theodore Allen.

577
00:48:41,111 --> 00:48:43,739
Homicide found his prints
at the scene.

578
00:48:43,814 --> 00:48:47,477
He's got a long history
of serious mental illnesses.

579
00:48:47,551 --> 00:48:50,213
He got a very strict
Southern Baptist upbringing.

580
00:48:50,721 --> 00:48:53,747
Somewhere along the line
they fell short.

581
00:48:53,824 --> 00:48:57,316
Victor dabbled in drugs, armed robbery
and assault, spent time...

582
00:48:57,394 --> 00:49:00,591
in prison for the attempted rape
of a minor.

583
00:49:00,664 --> 00:49:04,498
His lawyer made sure that didn't
last long. By the way...

584
00:49:04,568 --> 00:49:07,332
the lawyer was Eli Gould,
the "greed" victim.

585
00:49:07,738 --> 00:49:10,104
We'll stop this today,
ladies and germs.

586
00:49:10,174 --> 00:49:14,668
Victor's been out of circulation for
awhile, but we've a residence for him.

587
00:49:14,745 --> 00:49:17,270
- You're not buying this?
- Doesn't seem...

588
00:49:17,348 --> 00:49:18,940
Iike our guy, does it?

589
00:49:19,016 --> 00:49:20,074
You tell me.

590
00:49:21,252 --> 00:49:23,413
Our killer seems to have
more purpose.

591
00:49:52,284 --> 00:49:53,774
You ever take a bullet?

592
00:49:53,852 --> 00:49:56,980
Never in my thirty-four years,
knock on wood.

593
00:49:58,790 --> 00:50:00,382
I've only taken my gun out...

594
00:50:00,458 --> 00:50:02,983
3 times wanting to use it.

595
00:50:03,061 --> 00:50:04,722
Never pulled the trigger.

596
00:50:04,796 --> 00:50:05,990
Not once.

597
00:50:06,531 --> 00:50:07,361
You?

598
00:50:07,899 --> 00:50:11,733
Yeah. No, I never took a bullet,
but...

599
00:50:11,803 --> 00:50:14,397
I pulled my gun once.
Shot it once.

600
00:50:14,472 --> 00:50:16,565
- Really?
- It was my first one of these.

601
00:50:16,641 --> 00:50:18,836
We were a secondary unit.

602
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:21,743
I was pretty shaky going in.
I was a rookie.

603
00:50:22,147 --> 00:50:26,914
We bust open the door looking for this
junkie, the fucker opened fire on us.

604
00:50:28,153 --> 00:50:30,087
One cop got hit in the arm.

605
00:50:32,157 --> 00:50:33,852
Christ, what was his name?

606
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:39,920
It spun him like a top... no, Well,
more, you know, more like slow motion.

607
00:50:41,333 --> 00:50:42,925
I remember...

608
00:50:44,603 --> 00:50:46,195
riding in that ambulance...

609
00:50:46,271 --> 00:50:47,602
and, well...

610
00:50:47,672 --> 00:50:49,105
he died right there.

611
00:50:49,507 --> 00:50:50,701
Right there.

612
00:50:51,611 --> 00:50:53,841
Christ, what was his fucking name?

613
00:52:11,758 --> 00:52:14,283
SWAT goes before dicks.

614
00:52:18,031 --> 00:52:19,521
They love this.

615
00:52:20,434 --> 00:52:21,492
Police!

616
00:52:26,707 --> 00:52:27,696
Clear!

617
00:52:52,399 --> 00:52:53,832
Good morning, sweetheart.

618
00:52:55,135 --> 00:52:57,899
Get up now, motherfucker. Now!

619
00:53:07,147 --> 00:53:08,910
Get up, you sack of shit.

620
00:53:15,823 --> 00:53:16,983
Oh, fuck me.

621
00:53:17,592 --> 00:53:18,524
Dicks!

622
00:53:19,227 --> 00:53:21,354
You'll want to come
take a look at this.

623
00:53:24,732 --> 00:53:25,858
Dicks!

624
00:53:33,174 --> 00:53:34,436
Jesus.

625
00:53:34,509 --> 00:53:35,703
Victor?

626
00:53:35,777 --> 00:53:38,211
- What the hell?
- It's just Victor.

627
00:53:38,279 --> 00:53:39,940
- Call an ambulance.
- What the fuck?

628
00:53:40,014 --> 00:53:41,379
Hearse, I'd say.

629
00:53:41,449 --> 00:53:42,939
Call for forensics.

630
00:53:43,017 --> 00:53:44,609
Get your people out.

631
00:53:44,685 --> 00:53:46,448
No one touches anything.

632
00:53:46,521 --> 00:53:48,853
It's like a frigging wax sculpture.

633
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:54,122
Sloth.

634
00:54:03,871 --> 00:54:05,065
Aw, man.

635
00:54:05,139 --> 00:54:06,401
Goddamn.

636
00:54:06,874 --> 00:54:09,240
Those pictures were dated 3 days ago.

637
00:54:17,552 --> 00:54:19,076
This must be the first.

638
00:54:19,153 --> 00:54:20,017
Look.

639
00:54:20,822 --> 00:54:23,313
It's dated exactly one year ago today.

640
00:54:25,227 --> 00:54:27,092
I got a hair sample. I got a...

641
00:54:27,162 --> 00:54:29,426
stool sample. I got piss. I got...

642
00:54:29,498 --> 00:54:30,829
fingernails.

643
00:54:33,168 --> 00:54:34,567
He's laughing at us.

644
00:54:34,636 --> 00:54:36,934
You got what you deserved.

645
00:54:40,843 --> 00:54:42,276
He's alive! Cocksucker's alive!

646
00:54:43,345 --> 00:54:44,676
Guns down!

647
00:54:44,746 --> 00:54:47,010
Guns down!
Emergency on that ambulance!

648
00:55:04,166 --> 00:55:06,760
- He's playing games.
- Aw, no shit.

649
00:55:09,204 --> 00:55:11,638
We must forget our emotion.

650
00:55:11,707 --> 00:55:16,701
- We must focus on the details
- I feed off my emotions. How's that?

651
00:55:16,778 --> 00:55:18,211
Are you listening to me?

652
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:19,770
Yes, I can hear you.

653
00:55:19,848 --> 00:55:21,543
- Excuse me.
- What are you doing?

654
00:55:21,617 --> 00:55:24,381
- Closed crime scene. Leave.
- I got a right to be here.

655
00:55:24,453 --> 00:55:25,818
I'm a U.P.I. photographer.

656
00:55:26,822 --> 00:55:28,847
I got a fucking right to be here.

657
00:55:28,924 --> 00:55:30,755
- Get out! Jesus.
- Fucking jerk.

658
00:55:30,826 --> 00:55:32,760
I got your picture, man.

659
00:55:32,828 --> 00:55:35,092
- I got your picture.
- Yeah, yeah.

660
00:55:35,163 --> 00:55:38,031
Detective Mills.
M-l-L-L-S. Fuck off.

661
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:39,864
- You can spell!
- Fuck you!

662
00:55:40,703 --> 00:55:43,103
How they get here so fucking quick?

663
00:55:43,172 --> 00:55:46,767
They pay police for the information.
And they pay well.

664
00:55:47,443 --> 00:55:49,434
Hey man, I'm sorry.

665
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:52,947
They piss me off.

666
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:54,278
It's okay.

667
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:56,978
It's impressive to see a man
feeding off his emotions.

668
00:56:03,893 --> 00:56:09,160
1 year of immobility's right, judging
by the muscle and spine deterioration.

669
00:56:09,232 --> 00:56:12,895
Blood tests show a smorgasbord
of drugs in his system.

670
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:17,838
Even an antibiotic, probably to keep
the bed sores from infecting.

671
00:56:18,474 --> 00:56:22,570
Now, has he tried to speak
or communicate in any way?

672
00:56:22,645 --> 00:56:25,512
Even if his brain were not mush,
which it is...

673
00:56:25,581 --> 00:56:28,072
he chewed off his tongue long ago.

674
00:56:30,586 --> 00:56:31,518
Doc.

675
00:56:32,755 --> 00:56:35,747
Is there absolutely no chance
that he might survive?

676
00:56:36,592 --> 00:56:41,256
He'd die of shock right now if you
shone a flashlight in his eyes.

677
00:56:42,098 --> 00:56:46,933
He's had as much pain and suffering as
anyone I've encountered, give or take

678
00:56:48,005 --> 00:56:50,599
and he still has hell
to look forward to.

679
00:56:51,008 --> 00:56:52,270
Good night.

680
00:57:05,289 --> 00:57:06,950
Hello, William.

681
00:57:07,024 --> 00:57:08,616
It's Tracy.

682
00:57:09,193 --> 00:57:10,251
Tracy?

683
00:57:10,894 --> 00:57:11,952
Everything okay?

684
00:57:12,363 --> 00:57:15,230
Yeah. Yes, everything's fine.

685
00:57:15,299 --> 00:57:16,425
Where's David?

686
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:19,799
He's in the other room.
He's in the shower.

687
00:57:19,870 --> 00:57:22,896
I'm sorry to call you like this.

688
00:57:22,973 --> 00:57:24,463
Oh, it's all right.

689
00:57:25,476 --> 00:57:26,943
What can I do for you?

690
00:57:32,549 --> 00:57:34,574
I need someone to talk...

691
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:37,586
to. Do you think you could meet me...

692
00:57:37,654 --> 00:57:39,952
somewhere, maybe tomorrow morning?

693
00:57:40,891 --> 00:57:42,483
I don't understand.

694
00:57:43,727 --> 00:57:46,594
I feel stupid calling, but...

695
00:57:47,898 --> 00:57:50,992
you're the only person
that I know here.

696
00:57:51,402 --> 00:57:52,960
There's no one else.

697
00:57:53,337 --> 00:57:54,929
If you can...

698
00:57:55,005 --> 00:57:57,496
just give me a call, okay?

699
00:57:57,574 --> 00:57:59,270
I have to go now.

700
00:58:00,078 --> 00:58:01,170
Good night.

701
00:58:01,246 --> 00:58:02,270
Good night.

702
00:58:07,052 --> 00:58:07,085
FRIDAY

703
00:58:07,085 --> 00:58:09,679
FRIDAY

704
00:58:11,790 --> 00:58:12,882
I mean...

705
00:58:13,792 --> 00:58:15,555
you know this city so well.

706
00:58:16,461 --> 00:58:17,894
You've been here...

707
00:58:17,962 --> 00:58:19,486
so long.

708
00:58:21,266 --> 00:58:22,824
It can be a hard place.

709
00:58:23,435 --> 00:58:25,960
I don't know why I asked you to come.

710
00:58:27,605 --> 00:58:29,698
Why don't you talk to him about it?

711
00:58:30,108 --> 00:58:31,803
Tell him how you feel.

712
00:58:33,111 --> 00:58:35,978
I can't. You know,
I can't be a burden.

713
00:58:36,047 --> 00:58:37,810
Especially now.

714
00:58:39,784 --> 00:58:41,877
I'll get used to things...

715
00:58:41,953 --> 00:58:43,147
you know?

716
00:58:43,221 --> 00:58:45,382
I wanted to talk to someone...

717
00:58:45,457 --> 00:58:48,153
who's lived here for a long time.

718
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:53,695
I mean, upstate, it's
a completely different environment.

719
00:58:57,435 --> 00:59:02,134
Did David tell you that I teach
fifth grade? Well, I did.

720
00:59:03,908 --> 00:59:05,671
Yeah, he mentioned it.

721
00:59:08,913 --> 00:59:11,906
I've been going around,
looking at schools...

722
00:59:14,153 --> 00:59:16,246
but the conditions here are...

723
00:59:16,655 --> 00:59:18,088
horrible.

724
00:59:19,925 --> 00:59:21,586
What about private schools?

725
00:59:23,996 --> 00:59:25,020
I don't know.

726
00:59:26,999 --> 00:59:29,490
Tell me what's really bothering you.

727
00:59:32,271 --> 00:59:34,705
David and I are going to have a baby.

728
00:59:39,778 --> 00:59:40,938
Oh, Tracy. I...

729
00:59:42,615 --> 00:59:44,048
I don't think I'm the one...

730
00:59:44,717 --> 00:59:46,048
to talk to...

731
00:59:46,118 --> 00:59:48,882
- about this.
- I hate this city.

732
00:59:53,192 --> 00:59:55,217
I had a relationship once...

733
00:59:55,861 --> 00:59:58,125
it was very much like a marriage.

734
01:00:01,033 --> 01:00:02,625
We got pregnant.

735
01:00:03,869 --> 01:00:06,030
This was a long time ago.

736
01:00:11,810 --> 01:00:14,802
I remember getting up one morning
and going to work.

737
01:00:16,882 --> 01:00:21,320
Just a day like any other, except
it was the first day after I knew...

738
01:00:21,988 --> 01:00:22,920
about the pregnancy.

739
01:00:24,891 --> 01:00:27,257
And I felt this fear...

740
01:00:27,827 --> 01:00:29,658
the first time ever.

741
01:00:32,165 --> 01:00:33,598
I remember thinking...

742
01:00:34,367 --> 01:00:37,666
how can I bring a child
into a world like this?

743
01:00:37,737 --> 01:00:40,672
How can a person grow up
with all this around them?

744
01:00:48,348 --> 01:00:50,680
I told her I didn't want to have it.

745
01:00:52,852 --> 01:00:54,820
And over the next few weeks...

746
01:00:56,022 --> 01:00:57,683
I wore her down.

747
01:01:00,527 --> 01:01:02,461
I want to have children.

748
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:09,125
I can tell you now that...

749
01:01:10,036 --> 01:01:12,368
I know... I mean...

750
01:01:14,274 --> 01:01:16,208
I'm positive that...

751
01:01:16,276 --> 01:01:18,972
I made the right decision.

752
01:01:19,045 --> 01:01:22,208
But not a day passes
that I don't wish...

753
01:01:22,282 --> 01:01:24,978
that I had made a different choice.

754
01:01:28,622 --> 01:01:30,055
If you don't...

755
01:01:30,123 --> 01:01:31,215
keep...

756
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:35,723
the baby, I mean,
if that's your decision...

757
01:01:37,798 --> 01:01:40,392
don't ever tell him you were pregnant.

758
01:01:41,969 --> 01:01:45,063
but if you choose to have the baby...

759
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:47,230
then spoil that kid...

760
01:01:47,308 --> 01:01:49,071
every chance you get.

761
01:01:55,983 --> 01:01:57,041
That's...

762
01:01:57,118 --> 01:01:58,244
about...

763
01:01:58,319 --> 01:02:00,685
all the advice I can give you, Tracy.

764
01:02:07,828 --> 01:02:08,760
I must go.

765
01:02:09,764 --> 01:02:11,026
William.

766
01:02:18,105 --> 01:02:19,436
Thank you.

767
01:02:31,269 --> 01:02:35,603
Gluttony Greed Sloth Envy
Wrath Pride Lust

768
01:02:40,111 --> 01:02:44,378
Victor's landlord said there was cash
in the mail box...

769
01:02:44,450 --> 01:02:46,111
the first of every month.

770
01:02:50,857 --> 01:02:51,881
Quote:

771
01:02:52,358 --> 01:02:55,259
"l never heard a single complaint
from the tenant...

772
01:02:55,328 --> 01:02:58,957
in apartment 306, and nobody
ever complained about him.

773
01:02:59,031 --> 01:03:01,124
The best tenant I've ever had."

774
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,566
- End quote.
- A landlord's dream.

775
01:03:03,636 --> 01:03:05,604
A paralyzed tenant with no tongue.

776
01:03:05,671 --> 01:03:07,332
Who pays the rent on time.

777
01:03:08,207 --> 01:03:10,141
I'm sick of this waiting.

778
01:03:10,209 --> 01:03:11,369
This is the job.

779
01:03:12,712 --> 01:03:14,304
Why aren't we out there?

780
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:17,975
Why must we sit here rotting,
waiting till the lunatic...

781
01:03:18,050 --> 01:03:19,483
does it again?

782
01:03:19,552 --> 01:03:22,646
"Lunatic" is dismissive.
Don't make that mistake.

783
01:03:22,722 --> 01:03:25,418
Come on, he's insane. Look.

784
01:03:25,491 --> 01:03:29,655
Right now he's probably dancing around
in his grandma's panties.

785
01:03:29,729 --> 01:03:32,095
Yeah, rubbing himself
in peanut butter.

786
01:03:33,032 --> 01:03:34,090
How's that?

787
01:03:34,166 --> 01:03:35,497
I don't think so.

788
01:03:36,736 --> 01:03:38,931
His luck'll run out.

789
01:03:39,906 --> 01:03:41,931
He's not depending on luck.

790
01:03:45,011 --> 01:03:49,277
We walked in there exactly 1 year
after he tied Victor to the bed.

791
01:03:49,348 --> 01:03:51,111
One year to the day.

792
01:03:51,183 --> 01:03:53,447
- He wanted us to.
- Don't know that for sure.

793
01:03:53,519 --> 01:03:54,953
Oh, yes, we do.

794
01:03:56,089 --> 01:03:57,784
This note he left...

795
01:03:58,191 --> 01:04:00,125
his first words to us.

796
01:04:00,193 --> 01:04:02,889
"Long is the way, and Hard,
that out of hell...

797
01:04:02,963 --> 01:04:04,294
Ieads up to Light."

798
01:04:06,433 --> 01:04:08,025
Fuck him. So what?

799
01:04:08,101 --> 01:04:09,466
He's right, so far.

800
01:04:10,037 --> 01:04:14,531
Imagine the will it takes to keep
a man bound for a full year.

801
01:04:14,608 --> 01:04:17,042
To sever his hand and to use it...

802
01:04:17,110 --> 01:04:18,634
to plant fingerprints.

803
01:04:18,712 --> 01:04:21,613
To insert tubes into his genitals.

804
01:04:21,682 --> 01:04:24,651
This guy's methodical, exacting...

805
01:04:24,718 --> 01:04:26,982
and worst of all, patient.

806
01:04:27,054 --> 01:04:28,988
He's a nutbag.

807
01:04:29,056 --> 01:04:32,992
Because the fucker's got
a library card doesn't make him Yoda.

808
01:04:37,464 --> 01:04:38,658
You got money?

809
01:04:39,132 --> 01:04:41,066
I got 50. Fifty bucks.

810
01:04:41,134 --> 01:04:43,568
I propose a field trip. Come on.

811
01:04:47,407 --> 01:04:50,240
We'll make a list.
At the top we'll put "Purgatory"...

812
01:04:50,310 --> 01:04:54,246
"Canterbury Tales," anything relating
to the 7 deadly sins.

813
01:04:54,314 --> 01:04:55,747
- Ask yourself.
- Wait.

814
01:04:55,816 --> 01:04:58,842
What would he study
to do the things he's done?

815
01:04:58,919 --> 01:05:00,580
What are his interests now?

816
01:05:01,488 --> 01:05:03,183
Jack the Ripper, for instance.

817
01:05:03,590 --> 01:05:05,252
- Where are we going?
- Library.

818
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:22,375
Coupons. Coupons.
Free coupons. Discount--

819
01:05:22,443 --> 01:05:23,933
Discount coupons.

820
01:05:24,846 --> 01:05:29,545
They must have had about 50 health
violations during the last inspection.

821
01:05:29,617 --> 01:05:32,711
Sit across from me?
I don't want people thinking...

822
01:05:32,787 --> 01:05:33,913
we're dating.

823
01:05:34,555 --> 01:05:36,045
Give me your money.

824
01:05:37,358 --> 01:05:41,818
I'll give you this, but
I ought to know what are we doing.

825
01:05:46,701 --> 01:05:48,396
Somerset. How you doing?

826
01:05:48,870 --> 01:05:51,395
Didn't expect a menage-a-trois.

827
01:05:51,472 --> 01:05:53,906
It's not a problem. Sit down.

828
01:05:59,213 --> 01:06:02,410
Only for you do I do this,
so it's a big risk.

829
01:06:02,483 --> 01:06:05,714
- So we're in this fair and square.
- It's a deal.

830
01:06:11,159 --> 01:06:12,421
About an hour.

831
01:06:14,729 --> 01:06:16,425
Yep. Help yourself.

832
01:06:19,001 --> 01:06:20,764
That was money well spent.

833
01:06:22,071 --> 01:06:23,095
Yeah.

834
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:32,445
Alright.

835
01:06:32,514 --> 01:06:36,280
Telling you this, I'm trusting you
more than I trust most people.

836
01:06:36,351 --> 01:06:38,683
Good, 'cause I might punch you.

837
01:06:40,422 --> 01:06:44,358
It's probably nothing, but even so,
it's no skin off our teeth.

838
01:06:47,396 --> 01:06:50,422
The guy in the pizza parlor
is a friend from the Bureau.

839
01:06:52,267 --> 01:06:53,529
Who, stinky man?

840
01:06:54,269 --> 01:06:59,138
For years, the FBl's been hooked into
the library system, keeping records.

841
01:06:59,208 --> 01:07:03,042
- Assessing fines?
- No, monitoring reading habits.

842
01:07:03,112 --> 01:07:04,477
Look.

843
01:07:04,546 --> 01:07:06,480
Certain books are flagged.

844
01:07:06,548 --> 01:07:08,880
Books on, say, nuclear weapons...

845
01:07:09,284 --> 01:07:10,979
"Mein Kampf".

846
01:07:11,453 --> 01:07:16,322
Anyone who checks out a flagged book
has his library records fed to the FBl.

847
01:07:16,391 --> 01:07:18,655
Wait. How is this legal?

848
01:07:18,727 --> 01:07:21,525
Legal. Illegal.
These terms don't apply.

849
01:07:22,998 --> 01:07:26,991
You can't use the information
directly. It's just a useful guide.

850
01:07:27,402 --> 01:07:32,067
It might sound silly, but you can't
get a library card without an ID...

851
01:07:32,142 --> 01:07:34,337
and a current phone bill. See?

852
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:38,047
- So they run our list.
- Precisely.

853
01:07:38,815 --> 01:07:41,079
If you want to know who's reading...

854
01:07:41,151 --> 01:07:44,678
"Purgatory", "Paradise Lost"
and "Helter Skelter"...

855
01:07:44,754 --> 01:07:47,245
the FBl's computers will tell us.

856
01:07:47,323 --> 01:07:48,847
It could give us a name.

857
01:07:48,925 --> 01:07:52,019
Of a college kid writing
a term paper...

858
01:07:52,095 --> 01:07:53,687
on 20th-century crime.

859
01:07:54,330 --> 01:07:56,696
At least you're out of the office.

860
01:07:56,766 --> 01:07:58,199
Get a haircut.

861
01:07:59,102 --> 01:08:00,535
How do you know this?

862
01:08:00,603 --> 01:08:01,433
I don't.

863
01:08:02,105 --> 01:08:04,369
- Neither do you.
- Exactly.

864
01:08:12,448 --> 01:08:14,780
"Divine Comedy".

865
01:08:14,851 --> 01:08:19,049
"History of Catholicism" A book
called "Murderers and Madmen".

866
01:08:19,122 --> 01:08:22,614
"Modern Homicide lnvestigation".
"ln Cold Blood".

867
01:08:23,193 --> 01:08:25,286
"Of Human Bondage". Bondage?

868
01:08:25,361 --> 01:08:27,295
It's not what you think.

869
01:08:27,797 --> 01:08:29,788
The Marquis de Sade.

870
01:08:30,300 --> 01:08:32,063
- Marquis de Sade.
- Whatever.

871
01:08:32,135 --> 01:08:34,729
Works of St. Thomas Aqua something...

872
01:08:34,804 --> 01:08:36,897
Saint Thomas Aquinas. There.

873
01:08:36,973 --> 01:08:39,340
He wrote about the seven deadly sins.

874
01:08:40,010 --> 01:08:41,409
Is that it?

875
01:08:41,478 --> 01:08:42,308
Yep.

876
01:08:43,314 --> 01:08:45,680
- Let's try it.
- Jonathan Doe?

877
01:08:46,283 --> 01:08:47,511
Whatever.

878
01:08:47,585 --> 01:08:50,315
We're sure about that name, are we?

879
01:08:50,387 --> 01:08:52,753
You were, you saw it. John Doe.

880
01:08:53,224 --> 01:08:55,249
You want to go back, I'll go back.

881
01:08:55,726 --> 01:08:58,092
Let's take a look at him.
Talk to him.

882
01:08:58,796 --> 01:09:00,423
This is crazy.

883
01:09:00,497 --> 01:09:02,590
We'll just talk to him.

884
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:06,426
"Excuse me, sir. Do you
happen to be a serial killer?"

885
01:09:10,007 --> 01:09:11,440
You do the talking.

886
01:09:12,543 --> 01:09:15,103
Put that silver tongue of yours
to work.

887
01:09:15,179 --> 01:09:16,840
You've talked to my wife?

888
01:09:20,851 --> 01:09:22,113
Retarded.

889
01:09:22,519 --> 01:09:24,510
Charlie's fucking Angels.

890
01:09:25,189 --> 01:09:27,020
A name off a computer.

891
01:09:31,028 --> 01:09:32,120
Mills.

892
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:44,803
- You hit?
- No.

893
01:09:47,945 --> 01:09:49,880
He's going down!

894
01:10:06,464 --> 01:10:07,988
Fifth floor!

895
01:10:28,153 --> 01:10:30,587
Police. Is there a back way out?

896
01:10:31,189 --> 01:10:32,417
Lock your door.

897
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:37,524
Get out of the fucking hall, please.

898
01:11:03,255 --> 01:11:04,381
Get down!

899
01:11:06,592 --> 01:11:07,991
Get the fuck down.

900
01:12:45,025 --> 01:12:46,219
Goddamn it.

901
01:13:48,656 --> 01:13:50,954
Get out of the fucking way. Clear.

902
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:32,825
Where are you going?

903
01:15:32,894 --> 01:15:35,328
- I'm going in.
- No, no. Wait. Wait.

904
01:15:36,732 --> 01:15:38,893
What? He fucking shot at us.

905
01:15:38,967 --> 01:15:40,400
You can't go in.

906
01:15:40,469 --> 01:15:43,336
- We need a warrant.
- We got probable cause. Come on.

907
01:15:43,405 --> 01:15:46,239
Think about it. Think
how did we get here?

908
01:15:46,309 --> 01:15:49,836
- I can't tell anyone about the Bureau.
- Get out of the way.

909
01:15:49,912 --> 01:15:53,678
We have no reason to be here.
Would you listen to me?

910
01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:57,516
- Get off, get the fuck off me.
- Alright, I'm sorry.

911
01:15:57,587 --> 01:15:59,578
Just pay attention a minute?

912
01:16:00,156 --> 01:16:03,523
With a hole like this,
we won't be able to prosecute.

913
01:16:03,593 --> 01:16:06,426
The fucking guy'll walk.
That's what you want?

914
01:16:06,496 --> 01:16:09,522
By the time we clear a warrant...
Fuck that.

915
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:13,194
We need a reason to knock on
this door.

916
01:16:14,337 --> 01:16:15,770
Think about it.

917
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:18,432
Okay?

918
01:16:21,277 --> 01:16:22,369
Okay, okay.

919
01:16:23,379 --> 01:16:25,870
You're right. I'm all fucked up.

920
01:16:25,948 --> 01:16:27,711
When you're right, you're right.

921
01:16:35,792 --> 01:16:36,656
Well...

922
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:39,551
no point in arguing anymore.

923
01:16:40,963 --> 01:16:42,760
Unless you can fix that..

924
01:16:45,301 --> 01:16:47,235
You stupid son of a ...

925
01:16:55,545 --> 01:16:57,639
How much money we got left?

926
01:16:58,515 --> 01:17:00,107
So, yeah, I noticed...

927
01:17:00,184 --> 01:17:01,549
this guy going out a lot...

928
01:17:01,618 --> 01:17:05,281
when the murders were happening,
so l...

929
01:17:06,423 --> 01:17:08,789
So you called Det. Somerset?

930
01:17:08,859 --> 01:17:10,918
- She called Somerset.
- 'Cause this guy...

931
01:17:10,994 --> 01:17:13,929
was creepy and shit,
and one of the murders...

932
01:17:13,997 --> 01:17:16,591
- happened right over there.
- I told you the rest.

933
01:17:17,334 --> 01:17:18,926
Got everything?

934
01:17:19,002 --> 01:17:20,993
Have her sign. You must sign.

935
01:17:22,072 --> 01:17:23,061
Good.

936
01:17:24,241 --> 01:17:25,503
You did good.

937
01:17:25,843 --> 01:17:28,277
- I did what you said.
- Here.

938
01:17:28,345 --> 01:17:30,336
You get something to eat.

939
01:17:34,084 --> 01:17:35,847
Everybody stay outside.

940
01:18:37,582 --> 01:18:38,674
Victor.

941
01:18:50,161 --> 01:18:52,857
Wild Bill's Leather

942
01:20:31,197 --> 01:20:32,459
Fuck.

943
01:20:42,075 --> 01:20:44,475
LUST

944
01:20:51,952 --> 01:20:53,010
Somerset!

945
01:21:02,295 --> 01:21:04,490
- What?
- We had him.

946
01:21:05,231 --> 01:21:06,892
What are you saying?

947
01:21:06,967 --> 01:21:08,992
The fucking photographer in...

948
01:21:09,069 --> 01:21:10,161
the fucking stairs.

949
01:21:15,075 --> 01:21:17,066
We had him and we let him go.

950
01:21:23,917 --> 01:21:25,680
You're sure this is him?

951
01:21:25,752 --> 01:21:28,243
Yep. Good. Get it out.

952
01:21:28,922 --> 01:21:33,359
No pay stubs. No appointment books.
No addresses. Just this receipt.

953
01:21:33,426 --> 01:21:35,519
- Keep looking!
- Wait, look at this.

954
01:21:35,595 --> 01:21:38,530
This was under the bed.
His only source of funds?

955
01:21:38,598 --> 01:21:41,192
We got his money. I like it.

956
01:21:41,268 --> 01:21:43,702
Wait. You won't believe this.

957
01:21:43,771 --> 01:21:46,569
We haven't found a fingerprint.
Not one.

958
01:21:46,641 --> 01:21:49,508
Right. I don't believe you.
Keep looking.

959
01:21:54,281 --> 01:21:55,873
We could use some more men.

960
01:21:55,950 --> 01:21:57,110
I'm doing my best.

961
01:21:57,952 --> 01:22:01,285
- What're you getting?
- There are 2,000 notebooks here...

962
01:22:01,355 --> 01:22:04,620
and each notebook
contains about 250 pages.

963
01:22:04,692 --> 01:22:06,455
What about the killings?

964
01:22:07,695 --> 01:22:12,064
"What sick ridiculous puppets we are,
what a gross stage we dance on.

965
01:22:12,133 --> 01:22:14,260
What fun, dancing and fucking.

966
01:22:14,335 --> 01:22:17,964
Not a care in the world.
Not knowing that we're nothing.

967
01:22:18,039 --> 01:22:20,405
We are not what was intended."

968
01:22:20,474 --> 01:22:22,408
Wait, there's a lot more.

969
01:22:23,711 --> 01:22:27,374
"On the subway today, a man came up
to start a conversation.

970
01:22:28,049 --> 01:22:31,917
He made small talk, a lonely man
talking about the weather and things.

971
01:22:31,986 --> 01:22:34,147
I tried to be pleasant...

972
01:22:34,221 --> 01:22:37,156
but my head began to hurt
from his banality.

973
01:22:37,224 --> 01:22:39,385
I almost didn't notice...

974
01:22:39,460 --> 01:22:41,826
but I suddenly threw up all over him.

975
01:22:42,396 --> 01:22:44,330
He was not pleased...

976
01:22:44,732 --> 01:22:46,757
and I couldn't stop laughing".

977
01:22:48,169 --> 01:22:49,659
No dates.

978
01:22:49,737 --> 01:22:52,832
Placed on the shelves
in no discernible order.

979
01:22:53,909 --> 01:22:55,900
Just his mind poured out on paper.

980
01:22:57,245 --> 01:22:58,940
Looks like a life's work.

981
01:22:59,014 --> 01:23:02,450
With 50 men reading in 24-hour shifts,
it'd still...

982
01:23:02,517 --> 01:23:05,077
- take 2 months.
- I know.

983
01:23:12,861 --> 01:23:15,193
Phone? Phone? Phone? Phone?

984
01:23:18,767 --> 01:23:20,359
People, quiet!

985
01:23:36,618 --> 01:23:38,051
I admire you.

986
01:23:39,221 --> 01:23:42,486
I don't know how you found me,
but I was surprised!

987
01:23:43,558 --> 01:23:47,050
I respect you law enforcement
officers more every day.

988
01:23:47,129 --> 01:23:49,723
Well, I appreciate that, John.

989
01:23:50,065 --> 01:23:51,828
- I tell you--
- No, listen:

990
01:23:51,900 --> 01:23:56,166
I'll be re-adjusting my schedule
in light of today's setback.

991
01:23:56,238 --> 01:24:01,232
I just had to call and express my
admiration. Sorry I had to hurt...

992
01:24:01,309 --> 01:24:04,245
one of you, but I had
no choice, right?

993
01:24:04,747 --> 01:24:09,514
You'll accept my apology? I'd like to
say more but that'd ruin the surprise.

994
01:24:16,659 --> 01:24:17,751
Got it.

995
01:24:22,498 --> 01:24:24,090
Everybody back to work.

996
01:24:26,435 --> 01:24:27,697
You were right.

997
01:24:28,504 --> 01:24:29,664
He's preaching.

998
01:24:32,108 --> 01:24:34,508
These murders are his sermons to us.

999
01:24:34,577 --> 01:24:37,444
Look, we know him. We know him.
We know him.

1000
01:24:40,616 --> 01:24:42,049
Who's the blonde?

1001
01:24:46,656 --> 01:24:47,953
Looks like a pro.

1002
01:24:48,324 --> 01:24:49,291
Maybe.

1003
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:51,726
She caught John Doe's eye.

1004
01:24:54,030 --> 01:24:56,624
Wild Bills' Leather

1005
01:24:57,366 --> 01:25:00,961
- He came and collected it last night.
- Last night?

1006
01:25:01,037 --> 01:25:02,732
- Yeah.
- This man?

1007
01:25:02,805 --> 01:25:05,797
John Doe, easy name to remember.
He had a limp.

1008
01:25:05,875 --> 01:25:09,777
- What was this job you did for him?
- I've got a picture.

1009
01:25:09,846 --> 01:25:11,939
One sweet piece, actually.

1010
01:25:12,014 --> 01:25:14,745
I thought he was a performance artist.

1011
01:25:14,818 --> 01:25:16,809
You know the sort of guy that...

1012
01:25:16,887 --> 01:25:19,720
pisses in a cup on stage and then...

1013
01:25:19,790 --> 01:25:21,223
drinks it.

1014
01:25:21,291 --> 01:25:22,349
Performance art.

1015
01:25:22,693 --> 01:25:23,887
Right.

1016
01:25:26,864 --> 01:25:29,162
I think I undercharged him.

1017
01:25:29,233 --> 01:25:31,428
- You made this for him?
- I've made...

1018
01:25:31,501 --> 01:25:33,401
weirder shit than that.

1019
01:25:39,142 --> 01:25:40,632
They found the blonde.

1020
01:25:43,881 --> 01:25:45,314
The picture!

1021
01:25:45,382 --> 01:25:46,781
The picture!

1022
01:25:48,151 --> 01:25:49,880
Fucking pigs.

1023
01:25:51,822 --> 01:25:54,757
- I need you to move.
- I'll come out, but you guys...

1024
01:25:54,825 --> 01:25:57,157
Get the fuck out of the booth.

1025
01:25:57,227 --> 01:25:59,422
I've been in this cage the whole time.

1026
01:26:00,731 --> 01:26:02,164
Come on, this way.

1027
01:26:09,172 --> 01:26:13,268
-Can you do something about the music?
-We're looking for the guy.

1028
01:26:26,357 --> 01:26:29,520
You from homicide?
You better see this.

1029
01:26:39,504 --> 01:26:41,529
Get this thing off me.

1030
01:26:41,606 --> 01:26:43,631
Oh God, get it off of me.

1031
01:26:45,877 --> 01:26:47,310
Get him out of here, now!

1032
01:26:48,846 --> 01:26:50,507
I want to hear it again.

1033
01:26:50,848 --> 01:26:52,179
Tell me again.

1034
01:26:54,585 --> 01:26:57,816
You heard nothing strange,
saw nothing strange.

1035
01:27:01,659 --> 01:27:04,127
He asked me if I was married.

1036
01:27:04,195 --> 01:27:06,686
- I saw a gun in his hand.
- Where was the girl?

1037
01:27:06,764 --> 01:27:09,028
The what? What?

1038
01:27:09,100 --> 01:27:11,694
The prostitute. Where was she?

1039
01:27:11,769 --> 01:27:14,260
Someone comes to your establishment...

1040
01:27:14,339 --> 01:27:18,275
they want to go downstairs,
get some oo-la-la. Whatever.

1041
01:27:18,776 --> 01:27:20,937
They got to come to you. Yeah?

1042
01:27:21,612 --> 01:27:22,601
Yeah.

1043
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:24,011
You didn't see anyone?

1044
01:27:24,849 --> 01:27:28,285
With a package? A knapsack?
Something under their arm?

1045
01:27:28,353 --> 01:27:32,790
Everybody that comes in there's got
to be a package under their arms.

1046
01:27:32,857 --> 01:27:36,384
Some guys are carrying suitcases
full of stuff.

1047
01:27:36,461 --> 01:27:38,453
She was just sitting on the bed.

1048
01:27:45,471 --> 01:27:48,065
Who tied her down? You or him?

1049
01:27:48,140 --> 01:27:50,574
Do you like what you do for a living?

1050
01:27:50,642 --> 01:27:52,633
All these things you see?

1051
01:27:52,711 --> 01:27:56,408
No, I don't.

1052
01:27:57,883 --> 01:27:59,976
But that's life, isn't it?

1053
01:28:04,323 --> 01:28:06,416
He had a gun. And...

1054
01:28:07,026 --> 01:28:09,085
he made it happen.

1055
01:28:11,730 --> 01:28:13,925
He made me do it.

1056
01:28:14,233 --> 01:28:16,667
He put that thing on me.

1057
01:28:17,469 --> 01:28:20,165
And he made me wear it.

1058
01:28:20,239 --> 01:28:21,934
Then he...

1059
01:28:22,007 --> 01:28:23,838
told me to fuck her.

1060
01:28:25,677 --> 01:28:27,975
And I did. I fucked her.

1061
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:30,341
Oh, God! Oh, God!

1062
01:28:30,416 --> 01:28:32,782
Oh, God, he had a gun in my mouth.

1063
01:28:33,519 --> 01:28:36,181
The fucking gun was in my throat.

1064
01:28:36,588 --> 01:28:37,850
Fuck.

1065
01:28:40,692 --> 01:28:42,853
Oh, God. God.

1066
01:28:42,928 --> 01:28:45,795
God, help me.
Please, please, help me.

1067
01:29:04,384 --> 01:29:06,147
This won't have a happy ending.

1068
01:29:07,287 --> 01:29:09,881
- It's not possible.
- We catch him, I'll be happy enough.

1069
01:29:12,959 --> 01:29:16,395
If we catch John Doe and he turns out
to be the devil...

1070
01:29:16,463 --> 01:29:18,454
if he's Satan himself...

1071
01:29:18,531 --> 01:29:20,829
that might meet our expectations.

1072
01:29:21,468 --> 01:29:22,958
But he's not the devil.

1073
01:29:24,404 --> 01:29:26,065
He's just a man.

1074
01:29:26,639 --> 01:29:27,731
You know...

1075
01:29:28,475 --> 01:29:32,241
You bitch and you complain
and you tell me these things.

1076
01:29:33,079 --> 01:29:36,242
If you think you're preparing me
for hard time...

1077
01:29:36,316 --> 01:29:37,340
thanks, but...

1078
01:29:37,917 --> 01:29:40,181
But you got to be a hero.

1079
01:29:41,154 --> 01:29:42,917
You want to be a champion.

1080
01:29:42,989 --> 01:29:46,083
People don't want a champion.
They want cheeseburgers...

1081
01:29:46,159 --> 01:29:49,424
- play lotto and watch TV.
- How did you get like this?

1082
01:29:49,496 --> 01:29:50,929
I want to know.

1083
01:29:55,602 --> 01:29:58,298
It wasn't one thing,
I'll tell you that.

1084
01:29:59,607 --> 01:30:01,234
Go on.

1085
01:30:04,111 --> 01:30:07,444
I don't think I can continue to live
in a place...

1086
01:30:07,515 --> 01:30:11,281
that embraces and nurtures apathy
as if it was a virtue.

1087
01:30:11,352 --> 01:30:13,343
You aren't different or better.

1088
01:30:13,420 --> 01:30:16,116
I didn't say I was. I'm not.

1089
01:30:16,190 --> 01:30:19,455
Hell, I sympathize.
I sympathize completely.

1090
01:30:19,527 --> 01:30:21,461
Apathy is a solution.

1091
01:30:21,996 --> 01:30:27,901
I mean, it's easier to lose yourself
in drugs than it is to cope with life.

1092
01:30:27,968 --> 01:30:31,904
It's easier to steal what you want
than to earn it. It's easier...

1093
01:30:31,972 --> 01:30:36,568
to beat a child than to raise it.
Love costs. It takes effort, work.

1094
01:30:36,644 --> 01:30:41,741
We talk about mentally ill people.
We are talking about fucking crazies.

1095
01:30:41,815 --> 01:30:43,407
- No, we're not.
- Yes, today.

1096
01:30:43,484 --> 01:30:46,976
No, we're talking about
everyday life here.

1097
01:30:47,054 --> 01:30:50,319
You can't afford to be this naive.

1098
01:30:50,391 --> 01:30:52,154
Fuck off.

1099
01:30:52,226 --> 01:30:53,750
See, you...

1100
01:30:53,827 --> 01:30:55,761
You should listen to yourself.

1101
01:30:55,829 --> 01:30:57,922
Yeah. You say that...

1102
01:30:57,998 --> 01:31:00,489
the problem is people don't care.

1103
01:31:01,335 --> 01:31:03,428
So, I don't care about people.

1104
01:31:03,504 --> 01:31:05,335
Nonsense. You know why?

1105
01:31:05,406 --> 01:31:06,839
You care?

1106
01:31:06,907 --> 01:31:08,772
Want to know-- Damn right.

1107
01:31:08,842 --> 01:31:10,434
You'll make a difference.

1108
01:31:10,512 --> 01:31:13,003
Whatever. The point is that...

1109
01:31:13,081 --> 01:31:16,016
you're not quitting
because you believe...

1110
01:31:16,084 --> 01:31:18,018
these things you say.

1111
01:31:18,086 --> 01:31:19,781
You want to believe them...

1112
01:31:19,854 --> 01:31:21,287
because you're quitting.

1113
01:31:23,024 --> 01:31:27,961
And you want me to agree with you and
say "You're right, it's all fucked up.

1114
01:31:28,029 --> 01:31:32,193
It's a fucking mess. We should all go
live in a fucking log cabin."

1115
01:31:33,101 --> 01:31:34,534
But I won't.

1116
01:31:35,303 --> 01:31:37,203
I won't say that.

1117
01:31:38,340 --> 01:31:40,808
I don't agree with you. I do not.

1118
01:31:44,713 --> 01:31:45,543
I can't.

1119
01:31:55,957 --> 01:31:57,481
I'm going home.

1120
01:32:05,634 --> 01:32:06,828
Thank you, though.

1121
01:32:37,433 --> 01:32:39,264
I love you.

1122
01:32:39,835 --> 01:32:41,359
So much.

1123
01:32:49,512 --> 01:32:50,774
I know.

1124
01:33:51,007 --> 01:33:51,041
SUNDAY

1125
01:33:51,041 --> 01:33:53,271
SUNDAY

1126
01:33:53,343 --> 01:33:55,538
What's your emergency?

1127
01:33:56,680 --> 01:33:58,204
Could you repeat that?

1128
01:33:59,449 --> 01:34:01,110
I've done it again.

1129
01:34:08,125 --> 01:34:10,719
PRIDE

1130
01:34:11,294 --> 01:34:12,727
What have we got?

1131
01:34:12,796 --> 01:34:14,787
Sleeping pills.

1132
01:34:15,966 --> 01:34:17,729
Glued to one hand.

1133
01:34:17,801 --> 01:34:19,291
Telephone glued to the other.

1134
01:34:21,004 --> 01:34:22,266
You see what he did?

1135
01:34:23,206 --> 01:34:24,764
He sliced her up.

1136
01:34:25,142 --> 01:34:27,076
Then he bandaged her.

1137
01:34:27,144 --> 01:34:29,408
Call for help and you'll live.

1138
01:34:29,479 --> 01:34:31,310
But you'll be disfigured.

1139
01:34:33,283 --> 01:34:35,808
Or put yourself out
of your own misery.

1140
01:34:36,820 --> 01:34:38,082
Come on.

1141
01:34:38,155 --> 01:34:39,588
He cut off her nose.

1142
01:34:39,656 --> 01:34:41,419
To spite her face.

1143
01:34:41,491 --> 01:34:43,584
And he did it very recently.

1144
01:34:51,068 --> 01:34:52,160
Listen...

1145
01:34:53,171 --> 01:34:56,163
I've decided to stay on
till this is done.

1146
01:34:56,240 --> 01:35:00,108
One of two things'll happen.
Either we'll get John Doe...

1147
01:35:00,178 --> 01:35:03,272
or he'll kill 7 and this case
will never end.

1148
01:35:03,347 --> 01:35:06,680
Don't do me any favors. Thank you,
but I got it.

1149
01:35:06,751 --> 01:35:11,620
I'm asking to be your partner a few
more days. You'd be doing me a favor.

1150
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:24,795
You knew I'd say yes. We're here.

1151
01:35:25,770 --> 01:35:28,967
Your wife called.
Get an answering machine.

1152
01:35:31,776 --> 01:35:32,970
Detective?

1153
01:35:34,612 --> 01:35:36,307
After this I'm gone.

1154
01:35:37,114 --> 01:35:39,844
- No big surprise.
- Detective!

1155
01:35:42,720 --> 01:35:44,210
You're looking for me.

1156
01:35:47,024 --> 01:35:48,116
Don't fucking move.

1157
01:35:48,192 --> 01:35:49,523
On the floor.

1158
01:35:49,594 --> 01:35:51,721
- Stay back.
- On the fucking floor.

1159
01:35:51,796 --> 01:35:52,990
I know you.

1160
01:35:53,064 --> 01:35:54,395
Now. Get down.

1161
01:35:54,966 --> 01:35:56,594
Get down on your stomach.

1162
01:35:56,668 --> 01:35:58,101
You piece of shit. Now!

1163
01:35:58,770 --> 01:36:00,533
All the way. All the way...

1164
01:36:00,606 --> 01:36:02,096
fucker. Down.

1165
01:36:02,174 --> 01:36:03,539
Faster.

1166
01:36:03,609 --> 01:36:05,770
Faster, fucker. Now.

1167
01:36:05,844 --> 01:36:07,607
Nose on the ground.

1168
01:36:10,849 --> 01:36:13,943
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is this?

1169
01:36:14,019 --> 01:36:17,182
I'd like to speak
to my lawyer, please.

1170
01:36:18,891 --> 01:36:20,222
Goddamn it.

1171
01:36:22,461 --> 01:36:27,057
He cuts the skin off the tips of his
fingers. That's why we couldn't...

1172
01:36:27,132 --> 01:36:29,293
find 1 print in his apartment.

1173
01:36:29,368 --> 01:36:31,632
Seems he's done that for a while.

1174
01:36:31,703 --> 01:36:34,297
What about the bank accounts?
The guns?

1175
01:36:34,373 --> 01:36:36,466
So far everything is a dead end.

1176
01:36:36,542 --> 01:36:39,306
No credit history.
No employment records.

1177
01:36:39,378 --> 01:36:42,575
A 5-year old bank account
opened with cash.

1178
01:36:42,648 --> 01:36:44,980
We've tried tracing his furniture.

1179
01:36:45,050 --> 01:36:46,745
All we know about him...

1180
01:36:46,818 --> 01:36:49,309
is that he's independently wealthy...

1181
01:36:49,888 --> 01:36:51,253
well-educated...

1182
01:36:51,323 --> 01:36:52,756
and totally insane.

1183
01:36:52,824 --> 01:36:55,258
Because he's John Doe by choice.

1184
01:36:55,861 --> 01:36:59,820
- When can we question him?
- You can't. He goes to court now.

1185
01:36:59,898 --> 01:37:04,096
There's no way he'd turn himself in.
It doesn't make any sense.

1186
01:37:04,169 --> 01:37:05,329
There he sits.

1187
01:37:05,404 --> 01:37:07,771
It's not supposed to make any sense.

1188
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:09,102
He's not finished.

1189
01:37:09,175 --> 01:37:12,269
He's pissing in our faces
and we're taking it.

1190
01:37:12,912 --> 01:37:14,937
You know what I'm saying.

1191
01:37:15,014 --> 01:37:19,007
For the first time ever,
you and I are in total agreement.

1192
01:37:19,085 --> 01:37:20,609
He wouldn't just stop.

1193
01:37:20,687 --> 01:37:22,678
So what the fuck, man?

1194
01:37:22,755 --> 01:37:26,350
He's 2 murders away
from completing his masterpiece.

1195
01:37:27,427 --> 01:37:29,292
We'll wait for his plea.

1196
01:37:32,699 --> 01:37:32,832
My client says there're 2 more bodies.
Two more victims hidden away.

1197
01:37:32,832 --> 01:37:37,360
My client says there're 2 more bodies.
Two more victims hidden away.

1198
01:37:37,437 --> 01:37:42,465
He will take Detectives Mills and
Somerset to these bodies, only them...

1199
01:37:42,542 --> 01:37:44,635
and only at 6 o'clock today.

1200
01:37:44,711 --> 01:37:45,837
Why us?

1201
01:37:46,446 --> 01:37:48,141
He says he admires you.

1202
01:37:49,549 --> 01:37:51,312
It's part of the game.

1203
01:37:51,384 --> 01:37:55,650
If they don't accept this offer,
these bodies will never be found.

1204
01:37:55,722 --> 01:37:58,350
Frankly, I'm inclined to let them rot.

1205
01:37:59,726 --> 01:38:01,159
We've got him.

1206
01:38:01,227 --> 01:38:04,162
Downstairs, locked up. Done deal.

1207
01:38:04,230 --> 01:38:06,721
He'll get his free room and board,
cable TV.

1208
01:38:06,799 --> 01:38:10,826
My wife doesn't even have cable.
Why are we discussing this?

1209
01:38:10,903 --> 01:38:15,237
No. Something stinks. And this one--
You. In your $3,000 suit...

1210
01:38:15,308 --> 01:38:19,678
and that smug smile on your face.
Dealing for that piece of shit.

1211
01:38:19,747 --> 01:38:20,975
I don't like it.

1212
01:38:21,048 --> 01:38:22,982
The law requires me to serve...

1213
01:38:23,050 --> 01:38:26,577
my clients and their interests
as best I can.

1214
01:38:26,654 --> 01:38:28,849
We don't make deals here, Mr. Swarr.

1215
01:38:28,922 --> 01:38:30,412
My client informs you that...

1216
01:38:30,491 --> 01:38:33,187
if you do not accept,
he'll plead insanity.

1217
01:38:34,094 --> 01:38:35,527
Let him try it.

1218
01:38:36,230 --> 01:38:37,424
I'd like to see it.

1219
01:38:37,498 --> 01:38:41,434
We know with the extreme nature
of these crimes I'd get him off...

1220
01:38:41,502 --> 01:38:42,935
with such a plea.

1221
01:38:43,003 --> 01:38:45,563
I won't let this conviction slide.

1222
01:38:45,639 --> 01:38:49,598
If you do accept under
his specific conditions, he'll sign...

1223
01:38:49,677 --> 01:38:52,441
a full confession,
plead guilty right now.

1224
01:38:52,846 --> 01:38:55,076
It's your case.
Make a decision.

1225
01:38:56,684 --> 01:38:58,276
Full confession.

1226
01:38:58,352 --> 01:38:59,546
I'm in.

1227
01:38:59,620 --> 01:39:01,451
It must be both of you.

1228
01:39:02,790 --> 01:39:05,054
If he were to claim insanity...

1229
01:39:05,125 --> 01:39:07,958
this conversation is admissible.

1230
01:39:08,362 --> 01:39:10,455
That he's blackmailing us
with his plea.

1231
01:39:10,531 --> 01:39:13,557
My client wants to remind you,
2 more are dead.

1232
01:39:13,634 --> 01:39:17,126
The press'd love to find out
the police weren't concerned...

1233
01:39:17,204 --> 01:39:19,570
about finding and burying them.

1234
01:39:19,640 --> 01:39:21,801
If in fact there are 2 more dead.

1235
01:39:21,875 --> 01:39:23,536
The lab report came.

1236
01:39:23,610 --> 01:39:26,306
They did a quickie on
Doe's clothing and fingernails.

1237
01:39:26,380 --> 01:39:29,908
They found blood from Doe's fingers,
blood from...

1238
01:39:29,984 --> 01:39:33,420
the woman who's face he cut off,
and blood from...

1239
01:39:33,488 --> 01:39:35,080
a third party...

1240
01:39:35,156 --> 01:39:36,987
as yet unidentified.

1241
01:39:40,395 --> 01:39:42,761
You'd be escorting an unarmed man.

1242
01:39:45,667 --> 01:39:47,294
Let's finish it.

1243
01:39:51,005 --> 01:39:54,031
If John Doe's head splits open
and a UFO flies out...

1244
01:39:54,109 --> 01:39:56,441
I want you to expect it.

1245
01:39:58,346 --> 01:39:59,608
I will.

1246
01:40:02,417 --> 01:40:07,286
If I accidently shaved off a nipple,
would it be covered by workman's comp?

1247
01:40:11,860 --> 01:40:13,293
I suppose so.

1248
01:40:14,929 --> 01:40:17,796
If you were man enough
to file a claim...

1249
01:40:17,866 --> 01:40:20,664
I'd buy you one out of my own pocket.

1250
01:40:21,703 --> 01:40:24,900
I keep coming home late,
my wife'll think something's up.

1251
01:40:33,948 --> 01:40:34,972
You know...

1252
01:40:36,451 --> 01:40:37,475
Yeah.

1253
01:40:43,559 --> 01:40:44,548
What?

1254
01:41:54,698 --> 01:41:56,461
Will this wind hurt us?

1255
01:42:45,749 --> 01:42:46,977
Who are you, John?

1256
01:42:47,918 --> 01:42:49,351
Who are you really?

1257
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:51,353
What do you mean?

1258
01:42:51,421 --> 01:42:55,323
At this stage, what harm can it do
to tell us about yourself?

1259
01:42:55,392 --> 01:42:59,021
Doesn't matter who I am.
Who I am means absolutely nothing.

1260
01:42:59,095 --> 01:43:00,926
Stay on your left up here.

1261
01:43:04,936 --> 01:43:06,130
Where are we heading?

1262
01:43:07,371 --> 01:43:08,599
You'll see.

1263
01:43:09,206 --> 01:43:12,471
We're not just going to pick up
2 more bodies, are we?

1264
01:43:13,110 --> 01:43:15,374
That wouldn't be shocking enough.

1265
01:43:15,446 --> 01:43:18,210
You've got newspapers
to think about, yeah?

1266
01:43:19,517 --> 01:43:21,883
Wanting people to listen...

1267
01:43:21,953 --> 01:43:23,215
you can't just...

1268
01:43:23,287 --> 01:43:25,721
tap them on the shoulder anymore.

1269
01:43:25,790 --> 01:43:28,281
You have to use a sledgehammer.

1270
01:43:28,359 --> 01:43:31,294
Then you'll get
their strict attention.

1271
01:43:31,362 --> 01:43:32,954
But the question is:

1272
01:43:33,431 --> 01:43:36,229
Why're you so special
that people should listen?

1273
01:43:36,300 --> 01:43:37,790
I'm not special.

1274
01:43:38,803 --> 01:43:40,896
I've never been exceptional.

1275
01:43:41,539 --> 01:43:44,303
This is, though. What I'm doing.

1276
01:43:44,375 --> 01:43:45,535
My work.

1277
01:43:45,609 --> 01:43:47,270
Your work, John?

1278
01:43:47,345 --> 01:43:48,539
Yes.

1279
01:43:49,046 --> 01:43:52,038
See, I don't see anything special
about it, John.

1280
01:43:53,217 --> 01:43:54,616
That's not true.

1281
01:43:54,685 --> 01:43:58,485
No, it is true. And the funny
thing is, all this work...

1282
01:43:58,889 --> 01:44:03,383
in 2 months, no one'll care,
or give a shit, or even remember.

1283
01:44:03,995 --> 01:44:06,486
You can't see the whole complete
act yet.

1284
01:44:07,498 --> 01:44:09,261
But when this is done...

1285
01:44:10,501 --> 01:44:11,968
when it's finished...

1286
01:44:13,572 --> 01:44:15,301
it's going to be...

1287
01:44:18,176 --> 01:44:21,111
People will barely be able
to comprehend.

1288
01:44:21,580 --> 01:44:23,844
But they won't be able to deny.

1289
01:44:25,250 --> 01:44:26,945
Could the freak be more vague?

1290
01:44:27,919 --> 01:44:29,580
As far as master plans go...

1291
01:44:30,255 --> 01:44:32,519
I really can't wait for you to see.

1292
01:44:32,591 --> 01:44:34,354
It's going to be something.

1293
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:38,193
Know what?
I'll be standing next to you.

1294
01:44:38,263 --> 01:44:41,528
So when this thing happens,
be sure and let me know.

1295
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:43,067
Don't want to miss it.

1296
01:44:43,135 --> 01:44:44,796
Oh, don't worry.

1297
01:44:45,203 --> 01:44:46,465
You won't.

1298
01:44:48,373 --> 01:44:50,307
You won't miss a thing.

1299
01:45:17,069 --> 01:45:18,559
What's so exciting?

1300
01:45:19,638 --> 01:45:21,765
It's not too far now.

1301
01:45:28,981 --> 01:45:33,509
I've tried to figure something in my
head. Maybe you can help me out.

1302
01:45:35,288 --> 01:45:39,224
When a person is insane,
as you clearly are, do you know...

1303
01:45:39,659 --> 01:45:41,183
that you're insane?

1304
01:45:41,928 --> 01:45:43,828
Maybe you're reading...

1305
01:45:43,896 --> 01:45:46,023
masturbating in your own feces...

1306
01:45:46,099 --> 01:45:48,090
Do you just stop and go:

1307
01:45:48,167 --> 01:45:51,762
"Wow, it's amazing how fucking crazy
I really am"?

1308
01:45:51,838 --> 01:45:54,534
You know? Do you guys do that?

1309
01:45:54,941 --> 01:45:57,933
It's more comfortable
for you to label me insane.

1310
01:45:58,010 --> 01:45:59,272
It's very comfortable.

1311
01:45:59,946 --> 01:46:03,109
It's not something I would expect
you to accept.

1312
01:46:03,616 --> 01:46:06,710
But I did not choose. I was chosen.

1313
01:46:06,786 --> 01:46:07,946
Whatever.

1314
01:46:08,020 --> 01:46:10,284
I don't doubt that you believe that.

1315
01:46:11,023 --> 01:46:13,048
but it seems that you're...

1316
01:46:13,126 --> 01:46:15,219
overlooking a contradiction.

1317
01:46:15,294 --> 01:46:16,693
Meaning what?

1318
01:46:17,697 --> 01:46:19,289
Glad you asked.

1319
01:46:20,967 --> 01:46:22,730
If you were chosen...

1320
01:46:22,802 --> 01:46:25,236
that is, by a higher...

1321
01:46:25,304 --> 01:46:27,238
power...

1322
01:46:27,306 --> 01:46:29,399
and if your hand was forced...

1323
01:46:29,809 --> 01:46:33,142
it seems strange to me
that you'd get such enjoyment.

1324
01:46:33,546 --> 01:46:36,072
You enjoyed torturing those people.

1325
01:46:37,151 --> 01:46:40,314
That doesn't seem to fit
with martyrdom, does it?

1326
01:46:41,822 --> 01:46:42,982
John?

1327
01:46:47,895 --> 01:46:52,662
I doubt I enjoyed it more than Det.
Mills would enjoy time alone with me...

1328
01:46:52,733 --> 01:46:54,428
in a room without windows.

1329
01:46:55,302 --> 01:46:56,667
Isn't that true?

1330
01:46:57,237 --> 01:46:58,670
How'd you like to...

1331
01:46:58,739 --> 01:47:01,765
- hurt me with impunity?
- That hurts my feelings.

1332
01:47:01,842 --> 01:47:03,605
I would never.

1333
01:47:03,677 --> 01:47:06,441
You wouldn't only because
there's consequences.

1334
01:47:07,581 --> 01:47:10,607
It's in those eyes of yours, though.

1335
01:47:10,684 --> 01:47:13,346
Nothing wrong with a man
taking pleasure in his work.

1336
01:47:13,921 --> 01:47:16,788
I won't deny my own personal desire...

1337
01:47:16,857 --> 01:47:19,018
to turn each sin against
the sinner.

1338
01:47:19,593 --> 01:47:23,290
Wait a minute, I thought all you did
was kill innocent people.

1339
01:47:25,265 --> 01:47:27,961
Innocent? ls that supposed
to be funny?

1340
01:47:28,702 --> 01:47:30,363
An obese man.

1341
01:47:30,437 --> 01:47:32,962
Disgusting man who could barely stand.

1342
01:47:33,040 --> 01:47:37,534
You'd point him out to your friends
so that they'd join you in mocking him.

1343
01:47:37,611 --> 01:47:42,048
If you saw him while you ate,
you couldn't finish your meal.

1344
01:47:42,783 --> 01:47:46,344
Then the lawyer. You had to
secretly thank me for that.

1345
01:47:46,721 --> 01:47:49,815
This is a man who dedicated
his life...

1346
01:47:49,891 --> 01:47:54,658
to making money by lying with every
breath he could muster to keep...

1347
01:47:54,729 --> 01:47:56,663
murderers and rapists...

1348
01:47:56,731 --> 01:47:58,392
- on the streets.
- Murderers?

1349
01:47:59,300 --> 01:48:01,530
- Murderers, like yourself?
- A woman...

1350
01:48:01,603 --> 01:48:04,504
so ugly inside that she
couldn't go on living...

1351
01:48:04,572 --> 01:48:06,904
if she couldn't be beautiful outside?

1352
01:48:06,975 --> 01:48:11,344
A drug dealer. A pederast, actually.
Let's not forget...

1353
01:48:11,412 --> 01:48:14,210
the disease-spreading whore.

1354
01:48:16,451 --> 01:48:18,919
Only in a world this shitty...

1355
01:48:18,987 --> 01:48:22,821
could you say they were innocent
and keep a straight face.

1356
01:48:25,827 --> 01:48:27,522
But that's the point.

1357
01:48:28,930 --> 01:48:32,093
We see a deadly sin
on every street corner...

1358
01:48:32,166 --> 01:48:33,690
in every home and we...

1359
01:48:34,168 --> 01:48:35,100
tolerate it.

1360
01:48:35,670 --> 01:48:38,434
We tolerate it because it's common.

1361
01:48:38,506 --> 01:48:39,939
It's trivial.

1362
01:48:40,508 --> 01:48:43,102
We tolerate it morning,
noon and night.

1363
01:48:46,514 --> 01:48:48,209
Well, not anymore.

1364
01:48:50,685 --> 01:48:52,550
I'm setting the example.

1365
01:48:54,122 --> 01:48:55,885
And what I've done will be...

1366
01:48:55,957 --> 01:48:57,288
puzzled over...

1367
01:48:57,793 --> 01:48:59,283
and studied...

1368
01:49:00,462 --> 01:49:01,895
and followed...

1369
01:49:03,699 --> 01:49:04,893
forever.

1370
01:49:05,634 --> 01:49:06,896
Yeah.

1371
01:49:08,137 --> 01:49:09,365
Delusions of grandeur.

1372
01:49:11,473 --> 01:49:13,236
You should be thanking me.

1373
01:49:13,709 --> 01:49:15,074
Why's that, John?

1374
01:49:15,144 --> 01:49:18,307
Because you'll be remembered
after this.

1375
01:49:18,380 --> 01:49:22,316
Realize, Detective, the only reason
that I'm here now...

1376
01:49:22,384 --> 01:49:24,477
is that I wanted to be.

1377
01:49:24,553 --> 01:49:27,249
No. We would have got you eventually.

1378
01:49:27,323 --> 01:49:28,756
Oh, really?

1379
01:49:28,824 --> 01:49:33,056
So what were you doing,
biding your time? Toying with me?

1380
01:49:33,562 --> 01:49:36,656
Allowing 5 "innocent" people
to die until...

1381
01:49:36,732 --> 01:49:39,166
you felt like springing your trap?

1382
01:49:39,234 --> 01:49:41,168
What was the indisputable...

1383
01:49:41,236 --> 01:49:44,262
evidence you were going to use on me,
right before...

1384
01:49:44,340 --> 01:49:48,003
I walked up to you and put my hands
in the air?

1385
01:49:48,077 --> 01:49:50,272
John. Calm down.

1386
01:49:50,346 --> 01:49:52,837
I remember us knocking on your door.

1387
01:49:53,749 --> 01:49:55,114
That's right.

1388
01:49:55,184 --> 01:49:58,517
And I seem to remember
breaking your face.

1389
01:50:03,025 --> 01:50:05,585
You're only alive
because I didn't kill you.

1390
01:50:05,661 --> 01:50:07,356
Okay. Sit back.

1391
01:50:07,429 --> 01:50:09,455
- I spared you.
- Sit back.

1392
01:50:09,532 --> 01:50:12,023
Remember that when you
look in the mirror...

1393
01:50:12,102 --> 01:50:14,297
for the rest of your life...

1394
01:50:14,371 --> 01:50:17,863
or should I say for the rest
of what life I allow you...

1395
01:50:17,941 --> 01:50:19,306
to have.

1396
01:50:19,376 --> 01:50:21,310
Sit back, you fucking freak!

1397
01:50:21,378 --> 01:50:22,936
Shut your fucking mouth!

1398
01:50:24,447 --> 01:50:28,884
You're no messiah. You're a movie
of the week. A fucking tee-shirt...

1399
01:50:29,285 --> 01:50:30,809
at best.

1400
01:50:44,067 --> 01:50:46,399
Don't ask me to pity those people.

1401
01:50:46,469 --> 01:50:50,838
I don't mourn them any more than the
1000's that died at Sodom & Gomorrah.

1402
01:50:50,907 --> 01:50:55,503
Is that to say, John, that what
you were doing was God's good work?

1403
01:50:58,748 --> 01:51:01,512
The Lord works in mysterious ways.

1404
01:51:03,753 --> 01:51:06,187
Do you see those high tension towers?

1405
01:51:06,256 --> 01:51:08,087
That's where we're headed.

1406
01:51:08,158 --> 01:51:10,752
I see it. 9 o'clock,
and follow that road.

1407
01:51:24,942 --> 01:51:27,775
There sure as shit is no ambush
out here.

1408
01:51:27,845 --> 01:51:29,938
No fucking nothing out here.

1409
01:51:30,781 --> 01:51:33,944
They'll come up behind us in about
2 minutes.

1410
01:51:34,018 --> 01:51:36,111
I want you to go way up.

1411
01:51:36,187 --> 01:51:39,554
In thirty seconds, bank east
on my mark. Thirty seconds.

1412
01:52:41,520 --> 01:52:42,452
I'll get him.

1413
01:52:49,361 --> 01:52:50,521
Get out.

1414
01:52:51,429 --> 01:52:52,691
Slowly.

1415
01:52:53,431 --> 01:52:54,625
Stop.

1416
01:52:55,433 --> 01:52:56,695
Stay.

1417
01:52:59,871 --> 01:53:01,133
What do you got?

1418
01:53:02,707 --> 01:53:03,969
A dead dog.

1419
01:53:05,710 --> 01:53:07,439
I didn't do that.

1420
01:53:14,119 --> 01:53:15,313
What time is it?

1421
01:53:16,121 --> 01:53:16,985
Why?

1422
01:53:17,389 --> 01:53:18,788
I'd like to know.

1423
01:53:22,127 --> 01:53:23,219
7:01.

1424
01:53:26,464 --> 01:53:27,624
It's close.

1425
01:53:28,567 --> 01:53:29,829
Let's go take a look.

1426
01:53:33,471 --> 01:53:34,665
It's this way.

1427
01:54:23,122 --> 01:54:25,386
Down. Down. Down.

1428
01:54:27,126 --> 01:54:28,286
Watch him.

1429
01:54:29,862 --> 01:54:30,920
There he goes.

1430
01:54:32,031 --> 01:54:34,192
It's good we have
some time to talk.

1431
01:54:40,339 --> 01:54:43,274
The guy in red.
Keep the crosshairs on him.

1432
01:54:50,883 --> 01:54:52,407
A van's coming down the road.

1433
01:54:52,818 --> 01:54:53,911
From the north.

1434
01:55:03,296 --> 01:55:07,255
Be ready for anything.
Wait for my signal. Wait for me.

1435
01:55:13,073 --> 01:55:14,097
Get out!

1436
01:55:16,743 --> 01:55:17,767
Out!

1437
01:55:17,844 --> 01:55:20,005
Jesus Christ, man. Don't shoot.

1438
01:55:20,080 --> 01:55:21,342
Step away.

1439
01:55:22,082 --> 01:55:24,073
Turn around. Hands on your head.

1440
01:55:24,685 --> 01:55:25,913
What's going on?

1441
01:55:26,853 --> 01:55:28,013
Why are you here?

1442
01:55:28,088 --> 01:55:32,024
I'm delivering a package
for this guy, David.

1443
01:55:32,092 --> 01:55:33,457
Detective...

1444
01:55:33,527 --> 01:55:34,789
David Mills.

1445
01:55:41,935 --> 01:55:43,869
Get it. Slowly.

1446
01:55:56,516 --> 01:55:59,212
A guy paid me $500
to bring it out here.

1447
01:55:59,286 --> 01:56:01,481
He wanted it here at exactly
7 o'clock.

1448
01:56:02,055 --> 01:56:03,317
Put it down.

1449
01:56:04,458 --> 01:56:05,824
We got a box.

1450
01:56:05,893 --> 01:56:08,487
We got a box.
Call the bomb squad.

1451
01:56:08,563 --> 01:56:10,190
Bomb squad. We got a box.

1452
01:56:10,264 --> 01:56:11,822
Face the van.

1453
01:56:12,567 --> 01:56:13,727
Hands up.

1454
01:56:21,476 --> 01:56:22,340
Turn.

1455
01:56:24,011 --> 01:56:25,342
Okay. Go.

1456
01:56:25,413 --> 01:56:26,903
Off you go. Go.

1457
01:56:29,117 --> 01:56:31,210
I'm sending the driver out on foot.

1458
01:56:34,856 --> 01:56:36,289
He's headed north, along the road.

1459
01:56:36,357 --> 01:56:37,619
Have him picked up.

1460
01:56:47,301 --> 01:56:48,893
Oh, I don't know.
I don't know.

1461
01:56:55,476 --> 01:56:56,966
I'm going to open it.

1462
01:56:57,044 --> 01:57:00,241
When I said I admired you,
I meant what I said.

1463
01:57:19,701 --> 01:57:20,759
It's blood.

1464
01:57:20,836 --> 01:57:23,430
You've made quite a life for yourself,
Detective.

1465
01:57:23,505 --> 01:57:27,100
- You should be very proud.
- Shut the fuck up, you piece of shit.

1466
01:57:54,770 --> 01:57:56,294
California, stay away from here.

1467
01:57:56,371 --> 01:57:58,965
Stay away from here, now.
Don't, don't, don't come in here.

1468
01:57:59,041 --> 01:58:01,100
Whatever you hear, stay away.

1469
01:58:02,044 --> 01:58:04,137
John Doe has the upper hand.

1470
01:58:05,714 --> 01:58:07,045
Here he comes.

1471
01:58:07,115 --> 01:58:09,049
- Throw your gun down!
- What?

1472
01:58:09,117 --> 01:58:11,312
- I wish I could have lived like you.
- Shut up.

1473
01:58:11,386 --> 01:58:12,580
What the fuck you talkin' about?

1474
01:58:14,122 --> 01:58:15,953
Do you hear me, Detective?

1475
01:58:16,024 --> 01:58:17,685
I'm trying to tell you how much...

1476
01:58:17,759 --> 01:58:20,250
I admire you and your pretty wife.

1477
01:58:21,196 --> 01:58:22,356
What?

1478
01:58:22,431 --> 01:58:23,625
Tracy.

1479
01:58:24,533 --> 01:58:27,128
- What'd you fucking say?
- It's disturbing...

1480
01:58:27,203 --> 01:58:30,138
how easily a member of the press
can purchase...

1481
01:58:30,206 --> 01:58:32,140
information from the men
in your precinct.

1482
01:58:32,208 --> 01:58:34,039
What the fuck?

1483
01:58:34,110 --> 01:58:36,305
Throw your gun down!

1484
01:58:36,379 --> 01:58:38,370
I visited your home this morning...

1485
01:58:39,215 --> 01:58:40,876
after you left.

1486
01:58:41,718 --> 01:58:43,515
I tried to play husband.

1487
01:58:44,053 --> 01:58:47,648
I tried to taste the life
of a simple man.

1488
01:58:47,724 --> 01:58:48,986
Throw it away!

1489
01:58:49,058 --> 01:58:51,219
It didn't work out.

1490
01:58:51,294 --> 01:58:53,057
So...

1491
01:58:53,129 --> 01:58:55,063
I took a souvenir.

1492
01:58:56,733 --> 01:58:58,633
Her pretty head.

1493
01:59:03,473 --> 01:59:05,998
- What's, what's he talking about?
- Give me the gun.

1494
01:59:06,075 --> 01:59:07,337
What's goin' on over there?

1495
01:59:07,410 --> 01:59:09,435
Would you... Put the gun down.

1496
01:59:09,512 --> 01:59:10,911
I saw you with the box.
What was in the box?

1497
01:59:10,980 --> 01:59:12,845
Because I envy your normal life.

1498
01:59:12,916 --> 01:59:14,076
Put the gun down, David.

1499
01:59:14,150 --> 01:59:16,015
It seems that envy is my sin.

1500
01:59:16,085 --> 01:59:18,019
- What's in the box?
- Not until you give me the gun.

1501
01:59:18,087 --> 01:59:19,520
What's in the fucking box?

1502
01:59:19,923 --> 01:59:21,584
He just told you.

1503
01:59:21,658 --> 01:59:24,821
You lie! You're a fucking liar!
Shut up!

1504
01:59:25,161 --> 01:59:28,324
That's what he wants. He wan--
He wants you to shoot him.

1505
01:59:32,402 --> 01:59:33,835
No! No. You tell me.
You tell me that's not true.

1506
01:59:33,903 --> 01:59:36,098
- That's not true.
- Become vengeance, David.

1507
01:59:36,172 --> 01:59:37,434
She's all right. You tell me.

1508
01:59:37,507 --> 01:59:38,702
Become...

1509
01:59:38,776 --> 01:59:39,868
wrath.

1510
01:59:39,944 --> 01:59:41,104
Tell me she's all right!

1511
01:59:41,679 --> 01:59:43,203
If you murder a suspect, David...

1512
01:59:44,515 --> 01:59:46,608
you just throw it all away
and he knows it.

1513
01:59:47,251 --> 01:59:49,378
- She begged for her life, Detective.
- Shut up!

1514
01:59:49,453 --> 01:59:51,717
She begged for her life...

1515
01:59:51,789 --> 01:59:53,780
and for the life of the baby
inside of her.

1516
02:00:12,309 --> 02:00:13,640
He didn't know.

1517
02:00:27,491 --> 02:00:29,152
Give me the gun, David.

1518
02:00:37,167 --> 02:00:38,759
If you kill him...

1519
02:00:40,237 --> 02:00:41,602
he will win.

1520
02:00:45,909 --> 02:00:47,774
Oh God!

1521
02:00:47,845 --> 02:00:49,279
Oh God!

1522
02:01:58,750 --> 02:02:00,342
Well, we'll take care of him.

1523
02:02:09,595 --> 02:02:11,358
Whatever he needs.

1524
02:02:12,498 --> 02:02:14,056
Where you gonna be?

1525
02:02:16,769 --> 02:02:18,031
Around.

1526
02:02:22,508 --> 02:02:23,941
I'll be around.

1527
02:02:28,280 --> 02:02:30,612
Ernest Hemingway once wrote:

1528
02:02:30,683 --> 02:02:34,380
The world is a fine place
and worth fighting for."

1529
02:02:35,955 --> 02:02:38,048
I agree with the second part.
