00:01:10,075 --> 00:01:13,707
<i>In my younger and more vulnerable years,</i>

3
00:01:14,173 --> 00:01:17,521
<i>my father gave me some advice.</i>

4
00:01:19,292 --> 00:01:23,443
<i>"Always try to see the best
in people", he would say.</i>

5
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:30,402
<i>As a consequence, I'm inclined
to reserve all judgments.</i>

6
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:34,959
<i>But even I have a limit.</i>

7
00:01:37,844 --> 00:01:42,201
<i>Back then, all of us drank too much.</i>

8
00:01:43,226 --> 00:01:47,018
<i>The more in tune with the times we were,</i>

9
00:01:47,578 --> 00:01:50,873
<i>the more we drank.</i>

10
00:01:50,954 --> 00:01:55,039
<i>And none of us contributed anything new.</i>

11
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,760
When I came back from
New York, I was disgusted.

12
00:02:03,542 --> 00:02:05,576
I see, Mr. Carraway.

13
00:02:06,105 --> 00:02:10,579
Disgusted with everyone,
and everything.

14
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:15,608
Only one man was exempt from my disgust.

15
00:02:19,683 --> 00:02:23,351
One man… Mr. Carraway?

16
00:02:27,726 --> 00:02:29,717
Gatsby.

17
00:02:32,221 --> 00:02:34,401
Was he a friend of yours?

18
00:02:36,432 --> 00:02:38,774
He was…

19
00:02:39,397 --> 00:02:44,091
the single most hopeful
person I've ever met,

20
00:02:44,722 --> 00:02:48,393
and I'm ever likely to meet again.

21
00:02:50,225 --> 00:02:54,993
There was something about him,
a sensitivity. He was like…

22
00:02:56,491 --> 00:03:00,978
he was like one of those machines that
register earthquakes 10,000 miles away.

23
00:03:02,477 --> 00:03:04,620
Where did you meet him?

24
00:03:09,388 --> 00:03:11,920
At a… at a party.

25
00:03:13,002 --> 00:03:17,265
In New York.
<i>In the summer 1922,</i>

26
00:03:17,372 --> 00:03:21,763
<i>the tempo of the city approached…
hysteria.</i>

27
00:03:34,322 --> 00:03:36,870
<i>Stocks reached record peaks,</i>

28
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:42,057
<i>and Wall Street boomed
in a steady golden roar.</i>

29
00:03:42,128 --> 00:03:44,449
<i>The parties were bigger.</i>

30
00:03:44,644 --> 00:03:46,752
<i>The shows were broader.</i>

31
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,153
<i>The buildings were higher.</i>

32
00:03:49,581 --> 00:03:54,062
<i>The models were looser, and
the ban on alcohol had backfired,</i>

33
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:57,145
<i>making the liquor cheaper.</i>

34
00:04:01,814 --> 00:04:05,694
<i>Wall Street was luring
the young and ambitious,</i>

35
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:09,674
<i>and I was one of them.</i>

36
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:16,009
<i>I rented a house twenty miles
from the city on Long Island.</i>

37
00:04:16,227 --> 00:04:19,849
<i>I lived in West Egg, in a forgotten
groundskeeper's cottage,</i>

38
00:04:19,983 --> 00:04:23,463
<i>squeezed among the mansions
of the newly rich.</i>

39
00:04:23,925 --> 00:04:28,230
<i>To get started, I bought a dozen volumes
on credit banking and investment,</i>

40
00:04:28,304 --> 00:04:30,150
<i>all new to me.</i>

41
00:04:30,175 --> 00:04:31,621
<i>The stock market hit another high.</i>

42
00:04:31,647 --> 00:04:33,002
The market's moving up, up, up!

43
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,393
Well, of course, nothing is 100%.
Though I wouldn't go investing every penny.

44
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:41,890
<i>At Yale, I dreamed of being a writer.
But I gave all that up.</i>

45
00:04:42,542 --> 00:04:46,165
<i>With the sun shining and the
bursts of leaves on the trees,</i>

46
00:04:46,192 --> 00:04:48,761
<i>I planned to spend
the summer studying.</i>

47
00:04:49,926 --> 00:04:56,606
<i>And I probably would have, were it not
for the riotous amusements that beckoned,</i>

48
00:04:59,728 --> 00:05:04,414
<i>from beyond the walls
of that colossal castle,</i>

49
00:05:05,394 --> 00:05:09,765
<i>owned by a gentleman I had not yet met,</i>

50
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,788
<i>named Gatsby.</i>

51
00:05:14,157 --> 00:05:17,410
So, he was your neighbor?

52
00:05:17,679 --> 00:05:21,025
My neighbor…
Yeah.

53
00:05:22,356 --> 00:05:26,153
<i>When I think about it,
the history of the summer really began</i>

54
00:05:26,177 --> 00:05:30,201
<i>the night I drove over
to my cousin Daisy's for diner.</i>

55
00:05:30,234 --> 00:05:37,619
<i>She lived across the bay
in old moneyed East Egg.</i>

56
00:05:42,273 --> 00:05:46,389
<i>Her husband was heir to one of
America's wealthiest families.</i>

57
00:05:47,128 --> 00:05:51,055
<i>His name was Tom Buchanan.</i>

58
00:05:53,743 --> 00:05:56,903
<i>When we were at Yale together,
he'd been a sporting star.</i>

59
00:05:57,071 --> 00:06:00,461
<i>Now his glory days were behind him,
and he contented himself with—</i>

60
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,209
— Telephone, Monsieur Buchanan.
— It's me.

61
00:06:02,611 --> 00:06:06,311
<i>…other affairs.</i>
— I thought I told you not to call me here.

62
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,345
Boaz!

63
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,258
— Shakespeare!
— Tom!

64
00:06:12,353 --> 00:06:14,267
How is the great American novel coming?

65
00:06:14,321 --> 00:06:16,460
I'm selling bonds now, with
Walter Chase's outfit.

66
00:06:16,615 --> 00:06:18,847
Let's say, after diner,
you and I we go into town.

67
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:20,915
— I can't.
— Catch up with the ol'wolf pack.

68
00:06:21,202 --> 00:06:24,019
— Big day on the job tomorrow.
— Nonsense! We're going.

69
00:06:24,073 --> 00:06:26,546
First team, all American.

70
00:06:26,632 --> 00:06:28,870
See? Made me who I am today.

71
00:06:29,023 --> 00:06:32,504
Forest Hills, played the Prince of Wales.
What a sissy!

72
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:37,121
Live is something you dominate, Nick!
If you're any good.

73
00:07:01,857 --> 00:07:03,689
Henry! Where are you?

74
00:07:04,136 --> 00:07:05,308
Oui, Monsieur.

75
00:07:05,476 --> 00:07:07,567
The doors! Close them.

76
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,124
Allez!

77
00:07:10,227 --> 00:07:12,476
Sorry. Thank you.

78
00:07:13,068 --> 00:07:15,599
Is that you, my lovely?

79
00:07:19,095 --> 00:07:22,680
<i>Daisy Buchanan. The Golden Girl.</i>

80
00:07:23,035 --> 00:07:25,224
<i>A breathless warmth flowed from her.</i>

81
00:07:25,296 --> 00:07:29,471
<i>A promise that there was no one else
in the world she so wanted to see.</i>

82
00:07:30,098 --> 00:07:31,962
Do they miss me in Chicago?

83
00:07:31,963 --> 00:07:33,493
Uh yes, huh, uhm…

84
00:07:34,117 --> 00:07:36,425
At least a dozen people send their love.

85
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,330
How gorgeous.

86
00:07:38,538 --> 00:07:40,449
They're absolutely in mourning.

87
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:42,789
They're crying. Yes, they're wailing.
— No. I don't believe it.

88
00:07:42,843 --> 00:07:44,711
— I don't believe you.
— They're screaming, they're shouting,

89
00:07:44,772 --> 00:07:46,964
"Daisy Buchanan,
we can't live without you!"

90
00:07:47,346 --> 00:07:50,084
I'm paralyzed with happiness!

91
00:07:55,012 --> 00:07:58,138
Jordan Baker, a very famous golfer.

92
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:01,792
<i>She was the most frightening
person I'd ever seen.</i>

93
00:08:01,934 --> 00:08:05,891
Well I— I've seen your face on the cover
of Sporting Life. Nick Carraway.

94
00:08:06,501 --> 00:08:08,719
But I enjoyed looking at her.

95
00:08:08,809 --> 00:08:12,044
I've been lying on that sofa
for as long as I can remember.

96
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:14,611
This summer, I'll fling
you two together,

97
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,015
I'll push you into linen closets,
and out to sea in boats!

98
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,641
I'm not listening to a word.

99
00:08:18,679 --> 00:08:21,891
So Nick, Daisy tells me
that you're over in West Egg.

100
00:08:22,474 --> 00:08:25,993
Throwing your lot in with those
social climbing primitive new money types.

101
00:08:26,133 --> 00:08:28,662
My little shack's just a cardboard
box at $80 a month.

102
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:29,981
Your life is adorable.

103
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:31,861
I know somebody in West Egg.

104
00:08:31,986 --> 00:08:34,116
I don't know a single person
that side of the bay.

105
00:08:34,163 --> 00:08:36,522
Oh! You must know Gatsby.

106
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,522
Gatsby?

107
00:08:43,086 --> 00:08:44,342
What Gatsby?

108
00:08:44,343 --> 00:08:47,065
Madame, the dîner is servi.

109
00:08:58,415 --> 00:09:00,158
Would you like to hear a family secret?

110
00:09:00,226 --> 00:09:01,639
That's why I came over.

111
00:09:01,647 --> 00:09:02,846
It's about the butler's nose.

112
00:09:02,847 --> 00:09:04,459
Things went from bad to worse.

113
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,776
I hate that word, "hulking".

114
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:09,241
Nicky, I heard a rumor that you were
getting married to a girl out West.

115
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:10,741
It's a libel. I'm too poor.

116
00:09:10,776 --> 00:09:12,558
They have to be old so they die quickly.

117
00:09:12,588 --> 00:09:14,120
Can't we talk about something else?

118
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:15,494
— We ought to have plans.
— Anything. Crops.

119
00:09:15,525 --> 00:09:17,629
You're making me feel uncivilized, Daisy.

120
00:09:17,656 --> 00:09:19,109
Civilization's going to pieces.

121
00:09:20,723 --> 00:09:23,202
Have you read "The Rise
of the Colored Empires"?

122
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:26,579
By this fellow, Goddard.
Everyone ought to read it.

123
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:30,749
The idea is that it's up
to us, the dominant race,

124
00:09:30,895 --> 00:09:35,080
to watch out or these other races
will have control of things.

125
00:09:35,136 --> 00:09:36,994
Tom's very profound lately.

126
00:09:37,106 --> 00:09:39,269
He reads deep books with
long words in them.

127
00:09:39,551 --> 00:09:41,376
It's been proved. Scientific.

128
00:09:41,603 --> 00:09:44,112
We've got to beat them down.

129
00:09:52,331 --> 00:09:54,770
Buchanan residence?

130
00:09:55,138 --> 00:09:59,368
Monsieur Wilson from the garage.
Monsieur Buchanan?

131
00:09:59,431 --> 00:10:02,400
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

132
00:10:05,255 --> 00:10:07,158
I'm sorry.

133
00:10:09,248 --> 00:10:13,530
Well. This, huh, this Mr. Gatsby
you spoke of. He's my neighbor.

134
00:10:13,805 --> 00:10:16,854
Don't talk. I wanna hear what happens.

135
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:18,217
<i>I don't care what you do…</i>

136
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:19,327
Something happening?

137
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:20,845
Why, I thought everybody knew.

138
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,886
Well, I don't.

139
00:10:22,008 --> 00:10:24,309
Tom's got some
woman in New York.

140
00:10:24,353 --> 00:10:25,164
Got some woman?

141
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:29,623
She might have the decency not to
telephone at diner time. Don't you think?

142
00:10:30,448 --> 00:10:32,948
- Is that too much to ask?
- Daisy, don't create a scene.

143
00:10:33,664 --> 00:10:37,426
I love seeing you at my table, Nicky.
You remind me of a rose.

144
00:10:37,668 --> 00:10:39,692
An absolute rose, doesn't he?
— So, after diner…

145
00:10:39,693 --> 00:10:42,601
— Well, I'm not even faintly like a rose.
— Nick wanted to go into town.

146
00:10:42,614 --> 00:10:43,887
Right, Nick? To the Yale club.

147
00:10:43,944 --> 00:10:45,958
— Nicky. Stay!
— I have to work early.

148
00:10:46,026 --> 00:10:48,398
— Nonsense.
— There's so much to talk about.

149
00:10:48,673 --> 00:10:50,530
It's just for a drink or two.

150
00:10:56,703 --> 00:11:02,130
None of us could ignore that
fifth guest's shrill metallic urgency.

151
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,989
— Oh! Nicky.
— What?

152
00:11:06,104 --> 00:11:10,131
It's just… Oh you see, I think
everything's terrible anyhow.

153
00:11:11,012 --> 00:11:12,638
— Really?
— Yes.

154
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:16,368
I've been everywhere and seen
everything and done everything.

155
00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:21,506
I've had a very bad time, Nicky.
I'm pretty cynical about everything.

156
00:11:25,934 --> 00:11:29,246
Your daughter, I suppose she talks
and eats and everything?

157
00:11:29,316 --> 00:11:30,781
Pammy?

158
00:11:31,364 --> 00:11:33,070
Oh, yes.

159
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:38,347
Listen, Nick. When she was born, Tom was…

160
00:11:38,537 --> 00:11:41,379
God knows where.

161
00:11:45,616 --> 00:11:47,956
With God knows whom.

162
00:11:48,038 --> 00:11:52,431
And I asked the nurse if
it was a boy or a girl.

163
00:11:53,688 --> 00:11:57,287
And she said it was a girl.
And I wept.

164
00:11:57,913 --> 00:12:00,669
I'm glad it's a girl.

165
00:12:02,081 --> 00:12:04,851
And I hope she'll be a fool.

166
00:12:04,886 --> 00:12:08,098
That's the best thing a
girl in this world can be.

167
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:11,760
A beautiful little fool.

168
00:12:14,284 --> 00:12:18,838
All the bright, precious things
fade so fast.

169
00:12:20,686 --> 00:12:22,984
And they don't come back.

170
00:12:53,633 --> 00:12:58,932
<i>When I arrived home, I noticed that a
figure had emerged on my neighbor's dock.</i>

171
00:13:04,504 --> 00:13:07,349
<i>And something told me it was…</i>

172
00:13:07,602 --> 00:13:10,124
<i>Mr. Gatsby.</i>

173
00:13:17,443 --> 00:13:21,987
<i>He seemed to be reaching towards
something out there in the dark.</i>

174
00:13:34,992 --> 00:13:37,130
<i>The green light.</i>

175
00:13:42,025 --> 00:13:44,458
I don't wanna talk about this, doctor.

176
00:13:44,633 --> 00:13:47,027
Then write about it.

177
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:50,218
— Write about it?
— Yes.

178
00:13:50,925 --> 00:13:52,877
Why would I do that?

179
00:13:52,878 --> 00:13:56,379
You said yourself writing
brought you solace.

180
00:13:56,479 --> 00:14:01,382
Yeah well… it didn't bring
anyone else much solace.

181
00:14:01,785 --> 00:14:03,895
I wasn't any good.

182
00:14:03,929 --> 00:14:08,602
No one need ever read it.
You could always burn it.

183
00:14:12,969 --> 00:14:15,957
— What would I write about?
— Anything.

184
00:14:17,225 --> 00:14:19,432
Whatever brings you ease.

185
00:14:19,661 --> 00:14:24,249
A memory. A thought. A place.

186
00:14:25,968 --> 00:14:28,100
Write it down.

187
00:14:31,908 --> 00:14:33,490
A place…

188
00:14:39,266 --> 00:14:43,193
The Valley of Ashes was a grotesque place.

189
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:49,914
<i>New York's dumping ground half way
between West Egg and the city,</i>

190
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:56,497
<i>where the burnt out coal that powered the
booming golden city was discarded by men,</i>

191
00:14:56,532 --> 00:15:02,538
<i>who moved dimly and already
crumbling through the powdery air.</i>

192
00:15:02,626 --> 00:15:07,436
<i>This Fantastic Farm was ever
watched by Dr. T.J. Eckleburg.</i>

193
00:15:07,466 --> 00:15:11,585
<i>A forgotten oculist whose
eyes brooded over it all.</i>

194
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:14,981
<i>Like the eyes of God.</i>

195
00:15:16,956 --> 00:15:20,784
<i>Tom had invited me to town.
Apparently for lunch at the Yale club.</i>

196
00:15:21,139 --> 00:15:25,375
<i>But the day took an unexpected turn.</i>

197
00:15:26,376 --> 00:15:27,827
Come on.

198
00:15:27,942 --> 00:15:29,435
— Come on!
— What do you mean?

199
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:31,940
— Trust me!
— What are we doing?

200
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:34,036
— Hey, where are you going?
— Jump!

201
00:15:34,062 --> 00:15:35,981
— What are you doing?
— Come on!

202
00:15:35,999 --> 00:15:38,125
— Tom!
— Come on!

203
00:15:38,201 --> 00:15:41,887
Oh, God. Tom, wait!
Wait a second, would ya?

204
00:15:42,624 --> 00:15:45,077
Dominate, Nick!
Dominate!

205
00:15:47,168 --> 00:15:50,374
Hello, Wilson. How's business?

206
00:15:51,332 --> 00:15:53,316
Yeah, I can't complain.

207
00:15:55,273 --> 00:15:58,077
So uh… When're ya
gonna sell me that car?

208
00:15:58,184 --> 00:16:00,707
Well I've still got my man
working on it.

209
00:16:00,848 --> 00:16:02,745
Yeah well he works pretty slow, don't he?

210
00:16:03,099 --> 00:16:05,276
Maybe I'd better sell it somewhere else.

211
00:16:05,322 --> 00:16:07,560
Uh no, no no, I wasn't
saying that, I… was…

212
00:16:07,617 --> 00:16:10,506
If it's business, you should
be talking to me.

213
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,448
Get some chairs, why don't you,
so somebody can sit down!

214
00:16:16,265 --> 00:16:19,565
Uh, sure.
Yeah, let's talk business.

215
00:16:20,585 --> 00:16:23,474
Sure. I'll get the chairs, uh…

216
00:16:23,506 --> 00:16:25,416
Mirt, why don't you uh…
don't you entertain.

217
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:26,880
— Oh yeah.
— Yeah. I…

218
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:29,735
— Hi.
— Hi.

219
00:16:30,108 --> 00:16:32,654
— Mr. Buchanan. Candy?
— Uh. No! Thank you.

220
00:16:32,727 --> 00:16:34,403
— No?
— Uh. Mrs. Wilson.

221
00:16:34,443 --> 00:16:35,650
— Okay.
— Nick Carraway.

222
00:16:35,677 --> 00:16:37,466
Oh. A pleasure.

223
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:39,434
— Uh, Nick's a writer.
— Ah?

224
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:41,565
Oh, I'm— I'm in bonds, actually.

225
00:16:41,588 --> 00:16:43,411
I want you…

226
00:16:44,066 --> 00:16:45,442
get on the next train.

227
00:16:45,486 --> 00:16:47,418
— Now?
— Yes!

228
00:16:47,857 --> 00:16:50,135
Can we get the dog for the apartment?

229
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,183
Whatever you want.

230
00:16:51,233 --> 00:16:53,238
Hey, Mr. Buchanan, you want a—
you want a soda?

231
00:16:53,261 --> 00:16:56,113
— Uh! I'm fine!
— No? Ah.

232
00:16:56,402 --> 00:16:58,226
Call your sister,
she will like him.

233
00:16:58,254 --> 00:17:00,348
No no no. Uh. That's alright, thank you.

234
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:03,187
Catherine's said to be very good looking,
by people who oughta know.

235
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:04,411
Uh. Really I can't.

236
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:07,156
Hey! You wanna embarrass Myrtle?

237
00:17:09,013 --> 00:17:11,446
That's rude.

238
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:52,532
I'm Catherine.
Ain't we having a party?

239
00:17:53,052 --> 00:17:55,720
Hum… I'm not sure
now's a good time.

240
00:17:55,881 --> 00:17:58,541
I'm just going. Uh.
Actually, there are peop—

241
00:17:58,549 --> 00:18:01,154
Hullo! Oh Chester,
this must be the cousin.

242
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,940
Oh, you are adorable!

243
00:18:02,994 --> 00:18:03,735
Oh, thank you.

244
00:18:03,748 --> 00:18:06,547
— Chester McKee, pleasure to meet you.
— Nick Carraway.

245
00:18:06,603 --> 00:18:08,674
— Come on, don't you like me?
— Oh! Uh! Plant!

246
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:12,082
Myrtle? Myrtle?

247
00:18:16,187 --> 00:18:19,270
Myrtle Turtle!

248
00:18:19,568 --> 00:18:20,846
I really must go!

249
00:18:20,847 --> 00:18:23,402
Myrtle, get everybody a drink
before they fall asleep.

250
00:18:23,628 --> 00:18:25,580
Tom, I'm— I'm just leaving now.

251
00:18:25,581 --> 00:18:26,428
Nick! Wait!

252
00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:28,695
I'm just… I'm just going,
I've gotta get out of here.

253
00:18:28,719 --> 00:18:29,511
Nonsense!

254
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:31,511
Go on in there, talk to Catherine!

255
00:18:31,558 --> 00:18:33,987
Tom, I'm not comfortable here.
Daisy is my cousin.

256
00:18:34,045 --> 00:18:36,089
Listen, I know you like to watch.

257
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,688
I remember that from college.
— That's not what—

258
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:39,343
Oh no no no, I don't make any judgment.

259
00:18:39,376 --> 00:18:43,698
We have all summer! Now you wanna
sit on the sideline and watch,

260
00:18:43,899 --> 00:18:45,493
or d'you wanna play ball?

261
00:18:45,553 --> 00:18:47,886
— Play ball!
— Ain't we good enough for you?

262
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:50,649
Come on!
— Come on! Yeah!

263
00:18:51,641 --> 00:18:53,813
He's gonna sit on the side and watch? Uh?

264
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:55,558
Or is he gonna play ball?

265
00:18:56,661 --> 00:18:58,841
Take off your hat and stay a while.

266
00:18:58,888 --> 00:18:59,863
Oh, uh Nick.

267
00:18:59,864 --> 00:19:02,648
McKee is in the artistic game.
— Photography.

268
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:06,326
— Yeah. Nick's artistic.
— No! No no no, not really!

269
00:19:06,656 --> 00:19:09,062
I write a little, but…
— Really?

270
00:19:09,131 --> 00:19:12,045
Do you live on Long Island too?
— I live in West Egg.

271
00:19:12,103 --> 00:19:14,240
I was there at a party
about a month ago.

272
00:19:14,432 --> 00:19:18,035
A man named Gatsbys.
D'you know him?

273
00:19:18,089 --> 00:19:20,452
I live right next door to him.

274
00:19:20,502 --> 00:19:22,877
He's a cousin of Kaiser Wilhem's.

275
00:19:23,058 --> 00:19:25,663
You know, the evil German king?
— Really?

276
00:19:25,671 --> 00:19:29,195
Hey McKee! Take a picture of that!

277
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:32,088
Don't, I'm not one of those models!

278
00:19:32,244 --> 00:19:34,444
But you can, if you want.

279
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:40,998
Neither of them can stand
the person they're married to.

280
00:19:41,206 --> 00:19:42,911
Doesn't she like Wilson either?

281
00:19:42,949 --> 00:19:44,705
He's a greasy little scumbag.

282
00:19:44,787 --> 00:19:48,247
No thanks. I feel just as good
on nothing at all.

283
00:19:48,494 --> 00:19:52,077
Nerve pills. I get them
from a doctor in Queens.

284
00:19:52,193 --> 00:19:53,299
Do you want one?

285
00:19:53,372 --> 00:19:56,472
Oh no. My nerves are fine, thanks.

286
00:20:05,965 --> 00:20:09,125
<i>I had been drunk just twice in my life.</i>

287
00:20:09,361 --> 00:20:13,683
<i>And the second time was that afternoon.</i>

288
00:20:56,368 --> 00:21:00,008
<i>That night in the hidden flat
that Tom kept for Myrtle,</i>

289
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:03,969
<i>we were buoyed by a sort
of chemical madness.</i>

290
00:21:04,118 --> 00:21:08,691
<i>A willingness of the heart that
burst thunderously upon us all.</i>

291
00:21:09,191 --> 00:21:12,530
<i>And suddenly, I began to like New York.</i>

292
00:21:12,684 --> 00:21:14,929
This is better than the Yale club!

293
00:21:47,152 --> 00:21:49,631
<i>High over the city,</i>

294
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:55,145
<i>our yellow windows must have contributed
their share of human secrets</i>

295
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:59,252
<i>to the casual watcher in the street.</i>

296
00:22:02,341 --> 00:22:04,401
<i>And I was him too,</i>

297
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:10,048
<i>looking up and wondering,
I was within… and without…</i>

298
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:16,478
…enchanted and repelled…

299
00:22:17,195 --> 00:22:21,290
by the inexhaustible variety of life.

300
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,381
You have got no right to speak her name!

301
00:22:32,382 --> 00:22:35,058
— Daisy, Daisy, Daisy—
— You got no right to speak her name!

302
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:38,000
I'll speak her name when—

303
00:22:40,677 --> 00:22:42,631
Oh my God! You are crazy!

304
00:22:42,632 --> 00:22:43,960
You're a whore!

305
00:22:43,985 --> 00:22:45,987
They're gonna arrest you!

306
00:22:58,504 --> 00:23:00,689
I have no clue how I got home.

307
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:05,904
<i>But I do know that I awoke
with a distinctly uneasy feeling</i>

308
00:23:05,987 --> 00:23:08,742
<i>that Gatsby was watching me.</i>

309
00:23:10,925 --> 00:23:12,982
Watching you?

310
00:23:13,877 --> 00:23:17,920
Yes. Gatsby was always watching me.

311
00:23:19,634 --> 00:23:21,792
And how did you know that?

312
00:23:21,966 --> 00:23:23,874
I got an invitation.

313
00:23:26,085 --> 00:23:27,911
I was the only one.

314
00:23:27,985 --> 00:23:30,904
<i>By which I mean, no one except me</i>

315
00:23:31,265 --> 00:23:35,606
<i>ever received an actual
invitation to Gatsby's.</i>

316
00:23:37,601 --> 00:23:41,611
<i>You see, the rest of New York
simply came uninvited.</i>

317
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:49,418
<i>The whole city packed into automobiles
and all weekends, every weekend,</i>

318
00:23:49,794 --> 00:23:52,854
<i>ended up at Gatsby's.</i>

319
00:24:02,124 --> 00:24:07,510
<i>And I mean, everyone from every walk
of life and every corner of New York city.</i>

320
00:24:07,845 --> 00:24:13,709
<i>This kaleidoscopic carnival
spilled through Gatsby's door.</i>

321
00:24:13,917 --> 00:24:15,984
— Out of the way!
— My invitation.

322
00:24:17,217 --> 00:24:19,113
Hello.

323
00:24:24,673 --> 00:24:26,275
— Sir, my invitation.
— This way!

324
00:24:51,897 --> 00:24:57,000
<i>A caravansary of billionaire playboy
publishers and their blond nurses…</i>

325
00:24:57,591 --> 00:25:01,291
<i>Heiresses comparing inheritances
on Gatsby's beach.</i>

326
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:05,359
<i>My boss, Walter Chase,
losing money at the roulette tables.</i>

327
00:25:05,687 --> 00:25:10,752
<i>Gossip columnists alongside gangsters
and governors exchanging telephone numbers.</i>

328
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:14,694
<i>Film stars, Broadway Directors,</i>

329
00:25:14,725 --> 00:25:17,924
<i>morality protectors,
high school defectors,</i>

330
00:25:17,964 --> 00:25:22,362
<i>and Ewing Klipspringer,
dubious descendant of Beethoven.</i>

331
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:31,550
Do you know where I might find the host,
Mr. Gatsby? I live just next door.

332
00:25:31,624 --> 00:25:34,483
Gatsby? I've never seen Mr. Gatsby, sir.

333
00:25:34,564 --> 00:25:36,606
Why, no one has.

334
00:25:37,075 --> 00:25:42,706
Alone and a little embarrassed,
I decided to get roaring drunk.

335
00:26:12,002 --> 00:26:14,455
I thought I might see you here.

336
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:17,966
Hello!

337
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:19,942
I remembered you live next door.

338
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,382
It's like an amusement park!

339
00:26:21,776 --> 00:26:22,800
Shall we?

340
00:26:23,343 --> 00:26:26,833
— Did you get an invitation?
— People aren't invited to Gatsby's.

341
00:26:27,042 --> 00:26:29,945
Well I was. Seems I'm the only one.

342
00:26:30,153 --> 00:26:31,362
Who is this Gatsby?

343
00:26:31,363 --> 00:26:33,717
He was a German spy during the war.

344
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:36,165
Teddy Barton, Nick Carraway.

345
00:26:36,166 --> 00:26:37,364
A German spy?

346
00:26:37,572 --> 00:26:39,904
No no, no no. He's the Kaizer's assassin.

347
00:26:39,943 --> 00:26:41,927
— I heard he killed a man once.
— It's true!

348
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:43,858
— He kills for fun.
— Free of charge.

349
00:26:43,917 --> 00:26:45,784
He's certainly richer than God.

350
00:26:46,706 --> 00:26:49,198
You don't really believe
he killed a man, do you?

351
00:26:49,266 --> 00:26:51,510
Well, let's go find him, and
you can ask him yourself.

She's mine.

397
00:29:25,078 --> 00:29:28,697
Your face is familiar. Weren't you
in the third Division during the war?

398
00:29:28,729 --> 00:29:30,440
Uh, yes, the ninth battalion.

399
00:29:30,463 --> 00:29:31,987
— I was in the seventh.
— Excuse me.

400
00:29:32,017 --> 00:29:34,109
I knew you looked familiar.
Having a good time, old sport?

401
00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:36,977
Oh, the whole thing's incredible.
I live just next door.

402
00:29:37,582 --> 00:29:41,046
Uh, he sent me an actual invitation.
Seems I'm the only one.

403
00:29:41,047 --> 00:29:43,427
I still haven't met Mr. Gatsby.

404
00:29:43,452 --> 00:29:44,372
No one's met him.

405
00:29:44,379 --> 00:29:47,757
They say he's third cousin to the Kaiser,
and second cousin to the devil.

406
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:50,864
I'm afraid I haven't been
a very good host, old sport.

407
00:29:50,912 --> 00:29:52,914
You see…

408
00:29:55,196 --> 00:29:57,254
I'm Gatsby.

409
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:59,281
You're…

410
00:30:03,245 --> 00:30:06,154
<i>His smile was one of
those rare smiles</i>

411

<i>that you may come across
four or five times in life.</i>

412
00:30:09,953 --> 00:30:12,648
<i>It seemed to understand
you and believe in you,</i>

413
00:30:12,654 --> 00:30:16,307
<i>just as you would like to be
understood and believed in.</i>

414
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:18,560
Sorry old sport, I though you knew.

415
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:21,889
Please, just… I don't know
what to say, please forgive me.

416
00:30:21,937 --> 00:30:24,535
— It's quite alright.
— I've had so much to drink.

417
00:30:24,583 --> 00:30:25,997
— Yes?
— Mr. Gatsby, Sir.

418
00:30:26,035 --> 00:30:27,653
Chicago on the wire.
— Oh well…

419
00:30:27,925 --> 00:30:29,702
I'll be in just a minute.

420
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:32,673
I'm taking my new hydroplane
out in the morning.

421
00:30:32,688 --> 00:30:35,104
Would you like to go with me?

422
00:30:35,205 --> 00:30:38,021
— What time?
— The time that suits you.

423
00:30:38,155 --> 00:30:40,168
Well, that's very kind of you.

424
00:30:41,043 --> 00:30:43,613
Lovely to see you again, Miss Baker.

425
00:30:44,513 --> 00:30:49,337
If there is anything that you want…
just ask for it, old sport.

426
00:30:52,828 --> 00:30:56,442
Excuse me.
I will rejoin you later.

427
00:31:01,831 --> 00:31:04,048
I expected him to be…

428
00:31:04,243 --> 00:31:06,363
— Old and fat?
— Yes.

429
00:31:06,818 --> 00:31:12,040
Young men don't just drift coolly out of
nowhere and buy a palace on Long Island.

430
00:31:13,874 --> 00:31:16,722
He told me once he was an Oxford man.

431
00:31:17,114 --> 00:31:18,912
However I don't believe it.

432
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:21,041
— Why not?
— I don't know.

433
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:23,168
I just don't believe he went there.

434
00:31:23,404 --> 00:31:24,843
I beg your pardon.

435
00:31:25,157 --> 00:31:29,631
Ms. Baker, Mr. Gatsby would
like to speak to you, alone.

436
00:31:30,298 --> 00:31:33,377
— With me?
— Yes, madam.

437
00:33:13,045 --> 00:33:16,185
Nick. Nick!
Nick!

438
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:19,753
I've just heard the most shocking thing!

439
00:33:19,827 --> 00:33:21,706
Where have you been?
The car's waiting.

440
00:33:21,714 --> 00:33:23,699
— Come on, we're leaving.
— This is amazing.

441
00:33:23,885 --> 00:33:27,685
It all makes sense!
It all makes sense!

442
00:33:27,716 --> 00:33:29,484
Come on!

443
00:33:29,511 --> 00:33:31,769
— What makes sense?
— Everything.

444
00:33:31,786 --> 00:33:33,831
Come on, this is crazy.
We gotta get out of here.

445
00:33:33,847 --> 00:33:37,036
Oh, but here I am tantalizing you,
and I swore I wouldn't tell.

446
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,211
Just tell me.

447
00:33:38,536 --> 00:33:42,217
Oh Nick, I'm sorry, I swore.
I swore I wouldn't tell.

448
00:33:49,023 --> 00:33:51,620
Sorry to keep her from you, old sport.

449
00:33:51,935 --> 00:33:55,975
Don't forget, we're going up in
that hydroplane tomorrow morning.

450
00:33:56,249 --> 00:33:57,208
Yes!

451
00:33:57,209 --> 00:33:59,621
Mr. Gatsby sir, Philadelphia on the phone.

452
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:01,093
Yeah.

453
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:05,867
Good night, old sport. Good night.

454
00:34:06,548 --> 00:34:08,648
Thank you.

455
00:34:08,673 --> 00:34:10,675
What's the matter?
You run out of gas?

456
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:20,781
Nick! Come and see me!
We'll have tea next week!

457
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,774
I'm in the phone book.

458
00:34:23,296 --> 00:34:24,999
I'll call you up.

459
00:34:55,141 --> 00:35:00,459
<i>Well, we rode in the hydroplane,
and I attended two more of his parties.</i>

460
00:35:00,748 --> 00:35:03,605
<i>Even made use of his beach.</i>

461
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:05,425
<i>But you know, doctor,</i>

462
00:35:05,544 --> 00:35:11,800
<i>I realized that I knew absolutely
nothing about Gatsby at all.</i>

463
00:35:12,884 --> 00:35:14,838
<i>Until…</i>

464
00:35:36,164 --> 00:35:39,410
It's pretty, isn't it, old sport?
Haven't you ever seen it before?

465
00:35:39,795 --> 00:35:43,979
It's all a custom job.
Supercharged engine.

466
00:35:44,441 --> 00:35:47,525
Get dressed. We're going to lunch.

467
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:49,552
— Oh, well.
— Yeah.

468
00:36:04,092 --> 00:36:08,547
Look here, old sport. What…
What is your opinion of me anyhow?

469
00:36:08,613 --> 00:36:11,732
— My opinion?
— Yes, yes. Your opinion.

470
00:36:12,609 --> 00:36:15,162
I don't want you to get the
wrong impression from all these—

471
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:17,831
from all these bizarre accusations
you must be hearing.

472
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:20,463
A pack of lies, I guarantee.
You— you've heard the stories.

473
00:36:20,489 --> 00:36:22,454
— Oh! Well—
— I will tell you God's truth.

474
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,016
God's truth about myself.

475
00:36:24,089 --> 00:36:26,481
I am the son of very wealthy
people from the Middle West.

476
00:36:26,535 --> 00:36:29,056
Sadly, all of them are dead now.

477
00:36:30,786 --> 00:36:33,679
I was brought up in America, but
educated at Oxford because all my

478
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:36,978
ancestors had been educated there for many
years, you see, it's a family tradition.

479
00:36:37,197 --> 00:36:41,252
<i>The way he spoke! No wonder
people thought he was lying.</i>

480
00:36:41,453 --> 00:36:44,651
After my family died, I came
into a great deal of money.

481
00:36:44,853 --> 00:36:48,005
After that, I lived like a young prince
in all the capitals of Europe.

482
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:50,785
— Oh, Europe?
— Yes, Europe!

483
00:36:50,786 --> 00:36:54,204
Paris, Venice, Rome,
Vienna, Zurich,

484
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:58,934
Helsinki, Moscow, Istanbul,
collecting jewels —chiefly rubies—

485
00:36:58,989 --> 00:37:02,346
hunting big game, painting a little—
things for myself only.

486
00:37:02,371 --> 00:37:04,101
Trying to forget something sad.

487
00:37:04,102 --> 00:37:07,661
<i>Just when I thought it couldn't be
any more fantastical…</i>

488
00:37:07,718 --> 00:37:09,407
Then came the war, old sport.

489
00:37:09,421 --> 00:37:13,869
<i>…he became a war hero,
single handedly defeating the German army.</i>

490
00:37:13,896 --> 00:37:17,375
In the Argonne forest, I took two
machine gun detachments, so far—

491
00:37:17,414 --> 00:37:20,413
outnumbered, five to one—
there was half a mile gap on either side—

492
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:22,499
there wasn't a single
German soldier left standing—

493
00:37:22,533 --> 00:37:25,282
we stayed there two days and two nights—
and we saw piles of dead—

494
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:28,369
130 men, with only 16 Lewis guns—

495
00:37:28,409 --> 00:37:31,675
every allied government gave
me a medal — even Montenegro.

496
00:37:34,062 --> 00:37:36,471
Here, that's from Montenegro.

497
00:37:36,759 --> 00:37:39,753
"Major Jay Gatsby,
for Valour Extraordinary".

498
00:37:39,982 --> 00:37:41,050
That's right.

499
00:37:41,277 --> 00:37:44,756
And this something I always carry with me,
a souvenir of Oxford days.

500
00:37:44,903 --> 00:37:49,113
That was taken in Trinity Quad, the man
on my left is now the Earl of Doncaster.

501
00:37:49,182 --> 00:37:50,954
<i>What could I say?</i>

502
00:37:51,822 --> 00:37:54,561
<i>The photograph was undoubtedly authentic.</i>

503
00:37:54,748 --> 00:37:57,014
<i>Could it all be true?</i>

504
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:59,932
But of course, you don't need
to take my word for it, old sport.

505
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:01,832
At lunch today,
I'm going to introduce you

506
00:38:01,869 --> 00:38:03,996
to one of New York's most
distinguished businessmen,

507
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:06,789
a Mr. Meyer Wolfsheim.
My good friend.

508
00:38:06,835 --> 00:38:10,042
And he will confirm all I have told you,
and vouch for my good character.

509
00:38:10,104 --> 00:38:11,708
Oh, I'm sure that's not necessary.

510
00:38:11,753 --> 00:38:13,330
Oh, but it is though.

511
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:15,780
You see, I though you ought to
know something about my life,

512
00:38:15,821 --> 00:38:17,286
I didn't want you
to think I was…

513
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:20,280
Well, I didn't want you to think
I was just some nobody.

514
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,605
— No!
— You see, old sport, I'm…

515
00:38:22,645 --> 00:38:25,618
I'm going to make a very
big request of you today.

516
00:38:25,846 --> 00:38:27,022
A big request?

517
00:38:27,023 --> 00:38:31,135
Yes. Ms. Baker will explain everything
when you take her to tea this afternoon.

518
00:38:33,181 --> 00:38:35,620
Jordan? What's she got to do with it?

519
00:38:36,205 --> 00:38:38,236
Well I assure you it's nothing underhand.

520
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:41,813
Miss Baker's a honest sportswoman, she
wouldn't do anything that wasn't alright.

521
00:38:42,271 --> 00:38:44,303
Pull over! Pull over to the curb!

522
00:38:44,365 --> 00:38:46,610
Alright old sport. Alright.

523
00:38:51,869 --> 00:38:54,908
Right you are! I'll know you
next time, Mr. Gatsby.

524
00:38:54,949 --> 00:38:57,375
— Excuse me!
— Thank you.

525
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,872
— One of your old Oxford pals?
— Well I was…

526
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:04,662
I was able to do the
commissioner a favor once.

527
00:39:04,692 --> 00:39:06,537
He sends me a Christmas card every year.

528
00:39:07,173 --> 00:39:10,483
I imagine he'll be at lunch too.

529
00:39:15,031 --> 00:39:18,886
<i>Βy the time we reached the bridge,
Ι was impossibly confused.</i>

530
00:39:30,811 --> 00:39:33,391
<i>I didn't know what to think.</i>

531
00:39:33,703 --> 00:39:36,429
<i>But the city seen from
the Queensboro Bridge</i>

532
00:39:36,432 --> 00:39:39,991
<i>is always the city seen
for the first time…</i>

533
00:39:40,723 --> 00:39:47,044
<i>In its first wild promise of all
the mystery and the beauty in the world.</i>

534
00:39:48,375 --> 00:39:50,673
<i>Anything can happen!</i>

535
00:39:50,727 --> 00:39:53,568
<i>Now that we've slid over
this bridge, I though…</i>

536
00:39:53,738 --> 00:39:58,666
<i>Anything at all, even Gatsby,
could happen.</i>

537
00:40:00,591 --> 00:40:02,593
<i>Yes, absolutely.
Have you heard about…</i>

538
00:40:05,591 --> 00:40:08,264
Aah! My boy!

539
00:40:08,889 --> 00:40:10,891
Meyer, Meyer, Meyer.

540
00:40:11,246 --> 00:40:13,651
— Smell so good. Look at you!
— Look at you!

541
00:40:13,698 --> 00:40:16,058
Mr. Carraway, this is my good friend,
Mr. Meyer Wolfsheim.

542
00:40:16,687 --> 00:40:18,846
A wonderful pleasure, Mr. Carraway.

543
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:21,091
— My pleasure.
— I know all about you.

544
00:40:21,116 --> 00:40:22,488
— I see.
— Yes!

545
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:25,522
Mr. Gatsby's always talking about you.
— Really?

546
00:40:26,572 --> 00:40:27,963
Shall we?

547
00:40:28,139 --> 00:40:29,629
Come!

548
00:40:30,808 --> 00:40:34,152
Join us for a little lunch.

549
00:40:56,279 --> 00:40:57,879
♪<i>Hundred, hundred, hundred dollar bills</i>

550
00:40:57,905 --> 00:40:58,479
Yeah!

551
00:40:58,505 --> 00:41:00,755
— …hands off! Get your hands off me!
— Out! Out you go!

552
00:41:01,712 --> 00:41:05,850
Tell Walter Chase. He keeps his mouth
shut or he doesn't get a penny.

553
00:41:06,058 --> 00:41:07,685
We'll talk about that later.

554
00:41:07,686 --> 00:41:10,412
— Highballs, Mr. Gatsby?
— Highballs it is.

555
00:41:10,471 --> 00:41:12,002
— Alright!
— Take care of my friend.

556
00:41:12,327 --> 00:41:13,826
Mr. Warden. May I ask you…

557
00:41:13,827 --> 00:41:15,927
Look who's here!

558
00:41:15,954 --> 00:41:18,649
You see these fists?
He's the next heavyweight champion.

559
00:41:18,686 --> 00:41:20,474
Pay my respects to your boss.

560
00:41:20,531 --> 00:41:23,554
Hey, Jay! You're under arrest!

561
00:41:23,555 --> 00:41:27,180
You be careful now, you're turning into
a real jazz hound, commissioner!

562
00:41:31,151 --> 00:41:33,021
That's the commissioner back there.

563
00:41:33,043 --> 00:41:35,145
Mr. Gatsby! You table is ready.

564
00:41:35,273 --> 00:41:37,275
Gatsby!
Good to see you!

565
00:41:39,741 --> 00:41:42,319
You be careful with those
tables now, Senator.

566
00:41:42,342 --> 00:41:44,111
I'll put a bet on for you, Jay!

567
00:41:50,172 --> 00:41:53,432
We'll have the lobster. It's decorated
with truffles and fine herbs.

568
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:07,364
How's the bond business, Mr. Carraway?

569
00:42:07,505 --> 00:42:08,399
Fine, thank you.

570
00:42:08,467 --> 00:42:11,466
I understand you're looking
for a business connection.

571
00:42:11,517 --> 00:42:15,130
No. No no, no. No no no.
Uh. This isn't the man, Meyer.

572
00:42:15,239 --> 00:42:18,225
Remember this is the friend
I told you about.

573
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:21,813
Oh my, I beg your pardon.
I had the wrong man.

574
00:42:23,328 --> 00:42:26,866
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to make that call.

575
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:32,683
— Any luck, Senator ?
— What a gentleman.

576
00:42:32,714 --> 00:42:35,748
From one of the finest
families in the Midwest.

577
00:42:36,103 --> 00:42:38,161
Sadly, all dead now.

578
00:42:38,303 --> 00:42:42,678
When I first made the pleasure of Mr.
Gatsby's acquaintance just after the war,

579
00:42:43,385 --> 00:42:47,094
I knew I'd discovered
a man of fine breeding.

580
00:42:47,176 --> 00:42:54,033
A war hero, such medals, and…
a man, an Oxford man.

581
00:42:54,816 --> 00:42:57,937
You know Oxford?
— Yes, I've heard of it.

582
00:42:58,034 --> 00:43:00,236
Then you would know that when
it comes to married women,

583
00:43:00,237 --> 00:43:01,847
a man like this can be trusted.

584
00:43:03,191 --> 00:43:09,293
With a friend, with someone like you,
he'd never so much as look at your wife.

585
00:43:10,673 --> 00:43:14,720
— I'm not married.
— But you work on Wall Street, right?

586
00:43:14,749 --> 00:43:15,573
Yes.

587
00:43:18,491 --> 00:43:23,171
You're looking at my tie pin?
Finest specimen of human molar.

588
00:43:23,239 --> 00:43:24,385
Gentlemen?

589
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,664
Everything alright?

590
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:31,553
Yes! Yes, we… we were just
talking about other people's wives.

591
00:43:31,669 --> 00:43:33,501
— Other people's wives?
— Yes.

592
00:43:33,602 --> 00:43:35,389
Well, my work here is done.

593
00:43:35,558 --> 00:43:40,072
I'm gonna leave you gentlemen
to talk about your sports and your women.

594
00:43:40,135 --> 00:43:42,938
— Other people's wives?
— Hello, ladies.

595
00:43:45,677 --> 00:43:47,877
Who is he anyhow ? An actor?

596
00:43:47,878 --> 00:43:51,116
Meyer? No no no.
He's a gambler.

597
00:43:53,786 --> 00:43:56,581
He's the man who fixed
the 1919 World's Series.

598
00:43:57,007 --> 00:43:58,991
— Fixed it?
— Fixed it.

599
00:43:59,218 --> 00:44:01,232
How did he manage that?

600
00:44:01,571 --> 00:44:04,287
He saw the opportunity, I suppose.

601
00:44:04,495 --> 00:44:06,989
He's a very smart man.

602
00:44:15,705 --> 00:44:18,358
Now old sport, about Miss Baker
and that—

603
00:44:18,417 --> 00:44:20,836
that request we spoke of—
— Nick?

604
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:24,189
Nick!
— Tom! Funny seeing you!

605
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:26,648
— How have you been?
— Yeah! Good.

606
00:44:26,703 --> 00:44:29,804
Nick, Daisy is furious.
You haven't called her.

607
00:44:29,918 --> 00:44:33,557
Hey, uh. Mr. Gatsby, this is Mr. Buchanan.

608
00:44:35,383 --> 00:44:37,474
It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.

609
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:42,917
I never wouldn't have expected
to find you in this temple of virtue.

610
00:44:42,931 --> 00:44:45,204
Well, I was just having
lunch with Mr. Gatsby.

611
00:44:53,836 --> 00:44:54,810
Can I help you, sir?

612
00:44:54,868 --> 00:44:57,520
Jordan Baker, the famous
sporting star? The golfer?

613
00:44:57,921 --> 00:45:00,143
I— I see, I've spotted her. Thank you.

614
00:45:00,144 --> 00:45:01,092
There you are.

615
00:45:01,118 --> 00:45:03,047
What kind of game are you
and Gatsby playing at?

616
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:04,765
— This gentleman will be joining—
— Excuse me, one moment.

617
00:45:04,795 --> 00:45:06,274
— Nick, please, just sit down.
— Well, it's all rather strange,

618
00:45:06,294 --> 00:45:07,785
he picks me up in his fancy yellow car,

619
00:45:07,811 --> 00:45:09,469
and he's going on and on about his life,
— Please keep your voice down,

620
00:45:09,502 --> 00:45:11,125
— and the war and…
— Everybody can hear you.

621
00:45:11,139 --> 00:45:15,630
— What is this enormous request, Jordan—
— He wants you to invite Daisy to tea.

622
00:45:16,947 --> 00:45:19,016
Daisy?

623
00:45:19,831 --> 00:45:23,077
And Gatsby.
Why?

624
00:45:23,769 --> 00:45:26,315
I don't quite know where to start.

625
00:45:26,428 --> 00:45:31,354
You see, I didn't realize until
the other night that I'd met Gatsby.

626
00:45:31,536 --> 00:45:34,483
Five years ago. In Louisville.

627
00:45:35,517 --> 00:45:38,476
That was the day I got
my new English golf shoes.

628
00:45:42,269 --> 00:45:46,840
Daisy was by far the most popular girl
with the officers from Camp Taylor.

629
00:45:47,324 --> 00:45:48,410
Hello, Jordan.

630
00:45:49,044 --> 00:45:53,598
One of them was in the car with her.
It was Gatsby.

631
00:45:53,806 --> 00:45:58,140
And the way he looked at her, is
the way all girls want to be looked at.

632
00:45:58,529 --> 00:46:00,731
So. Tell me what happened.

633
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:02,474
Well, I don't know.

634
00:46:02,785 --> 00:46:04,441
Charge!

635
00:46:06,921 --> 00:46:09,132
Gatsby was sent off to war.

636
00:46:09,372 --> 00:46:12,596
When the war ended,
Daisy waited,

637
00:46:12,933 --> 00:46:17,053
but for some unknown reason,
Gatsby couldn't return.

638
00:46:17,337 --> 00:46:22,803
A year later, Tom Buchanan of Chicago
swept in and stole her away.

639
00:46:22,893 --> 00:46:27,722
He gave her a string of pearls
worth 350,000 dollars.

640
00:46:28,493 --> 00:46:31,359
But the morning of the wedding,
Daisy received a letter.

641
00:46:31,373 --> 00:46:33,745
Tell them Daisy's changed her mind!

642
00:46:33,798 --> 00:46:35,606
— What is this?
— Daisy, please!

643
00:46:35,665 --> 00:46:37,985
— Hand it to me!
— No!

644
00:46:38,098 --> 00:46:39,800
Leave me alone!

645
00:46:39,837 --> 00:46:41,213
Jordan, no one must know about this.

646
00:46:41,214 --> 00:46:45,201
— But what was in the letter?
— I don't know, she wouldn't tell me.

647
00:46:45,777 --> 00:46:47,263
But it was too late.

648
00:46:47,394 --> 00:46:51,644
That day at five o'clock,
Daisy Fay married Tom Buchanan

649
00:46:51,732 --> 00:46:55,779
with more pomp and circumstance
Louisville had ever seen.

650
00:46:56,304 --> 00:46:58,304
Congratulations, Mr. Buchanan!

651
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:03,853
After the honeymoon,
I saw them in Santa Barbara.

652
00:47:04,026 --> 00:47:07,667
Well it was touching, really, I'd never
seen a girl so in love with her husband.

653
00:47:08,107 --> 00:47:10,759
A week later, Tom crashed his car.

654
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:13,938
The girl with him was a chambermaid
at the Santa Barbara hotel.

655
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:15,784
It got into all the papers.

656
00:47:16,999 --> 00:47:19,667
— It's a strange coincidence.
— What is?

657
00:47:19,728 --> 00:47:22,975
The fact that Gatsby's house
is just across the bay.

658
00:47:23,569 --> 00:47:28,121
It's no coincidence. He bought
that house to be near her.

659
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:31,863
He threw all those parties,
hoping she would wander in one night.

660
00:47:31,937 --> 00:47:36,092
He constantly asked about Daisy.
I was just the first person that knew her.

661
00:47:37,191 --> 00:47:40,244
All that for a girl
he hasn't seen in five years.

662
00:47:40,309 --> 00:47:42,981
And now he just wants me
to invite her over to tea.

663
00:47:43,656 --> 00:47:45,845
The modesty of it…

664
00:47:46,261 --> 00:47:48,099
kind of take your breath
away, doesn't it?

665
00:47:48,122 --> 00:47:50,908
Evening, sweet hearts.
Where're you kids going?

666
00:47:51,006 --> 00:47:52,798
— Long Island, please.
— Long Island.

667
00:47:52,851 --> 00:47:55,981
And you think I should?
I mean, does Daisy want to see Gatsby?

668
00:47:56,111 --> 00:47:58,002
She's absolutely not to know.

669
00:47:58,328 --> 00:48:01,891
You're just supposed to invite her over,
so he can happen to pass by.

670
00:48:02,605 --> 00:48:05,124
<i>I remember feeling torn.</i>

671
00:48:05,445 --> 00:48:09,210
<i>Was it right to bring my cousin
Daisy, a married woman,</i>

672
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:12,652
<i>together with a man I hardly knew?</i>

673
00:48:17,426 --> 00:48:21,563
<i>When I returned home,
Gatsby's was lit from tower to cellar</i>

674
00:48:21,593 --> 00:48:25,013
<i>as if for another wild party.</i>

675
00:48:28,052 --> 00:48:30,491
<i>But there wasn't a sound.</i>

676
00:48:44,866 --> 00:48:47,171
— Thank you.
 — Have a good night, sir.

677
00:48:56,052 --> 00:49:00,138
Your place looks like
the World's fair or Coney Island.

678
00:49:00,299 --> 00:49:02,250
— Ah, does it?
— Yes.

679
00:49:02,325 --> 00:49:05,948
Oh I— I've just been… glancing
into some of the rooms.

680
00:49:06,348 --> 00:49:08,586
What'd you say we go
to Coney Island, old sport?

681
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:12,287
We— we could take my car if you want.
— Oh, uh… It's too late, tonight.

682
00:49:12,325 --> 00:49:14,074
We could take a plunge
in the swimming pool,

683
00:49:14,114 --> 00:49:16,682
I haven't made use of it all summer.
— I must go to bed.

684
00:49:17,546 --> 00:49:19,170
Alright.

685
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:28,230
Happy to do it.

686
00:49:29,078 --> 00:49:32,277
I'm going to call Daisy
and invite her to tea.

687
00:49:32,284 --> 00:49:33,301
That's alright, I— I— I—

688
00:49:33,302 --> 00:49:35,552
— What day would suit you?
— What day would suit you!?

689
00:49:35,574 --> 00:49:37,149
I don't want to put you to any trouble.

690
00:49:37,212 --> 00:49:38,984
The day after tomorrow alright?

691
00:49:39,266 --> 00:49:41,299
The day after tomorrow?!

692
00:49:41,879 --> 00:49:46,180
Well I… See, I— I'd want
to get the grass cut.

693
00:49:47,905 --> 00:49:51,005
— Well…
— Uh…

694
00:49:52,054 --> 00:49:55,777
Look here old sport, you—
you don't make much money, do you?

695
00:49:55,825 --> 00:49:58,139
— Not really.
— If you forgive me.

696
00:49:58,711 --> 00:50:02,478
You see… I happen to run a little—
a little business on the side,

697
00:50:02,498 --> 00:50:05,268
a sort of side line. I mean,
you understand what I'm saying, right?

698
00:50:05,637 --> 00:50:08,569
You do sell bond, don't you, old sport?
— I'm trying to.

699
00:50:08,622 --> 00:50:11,834
Right, well, it happens to be a
rather confidential sort of thing,

700
00:50:11,861 --> 00:50:14,007
but you might make a nice
bit of money on the side.

701
00:50:14,033 --> 00:50:15,649
Uh no, thank you,
I have my hands full.

702
00:50:15,692 --> 00:50:18,499
But you wouldn't have to do any
business with Wolfsheim, I assure you.

703
00:50:18,536 --> 00:50:20,388
It's a favor, Jay, just a favor.

704
00:50:22,988 --> 00:50:25,565
Yes. I'm happy to do it.

705
00:50:25,971 --> 00:50:28,352
— A favor?
— Yes!

706
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:35,373
— Well, good night.
— Good night.

707
00:51:23,639 --> 00:51:27,643
One of the papers says they thought
the rain would stop about 4:00.

708
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:31,443
I think it was the—
I think it was the 'Journal'.

709
00:51:34,292 --> 00:51:35,776
Just in to the right, gentlemen.

710
00:51:35,803 --> 00:51:38,701
To the right, in the living room.
Thank you.

711
00:51:43,083 --> 00:51:45,011
Is everything alright?

712
00:51:45,229 --> 00:51:47,904
Oh, the grass looks fine,
if that's what you mean.

713
00:51:48,182 --> 00:51:50,923
Grass? What grass?

714
00:51:54,503 --> 00:51:56,313
I bought cakes.

715
00:52:07,799 --> 00:52:10,169
Have you— have you got
everything you need?

716
00:52:10,184 --> 00:52:11,717
Perhaps more flowers.

717
00:52:12,845 --> 00:52:16,415
— I think they did a fine job, don't you?
— Beautiful.

718
00:52:16,651 --> 00:52:18,421
You think it's too much?

719
00:52:19,656 --> 00:52:22,087
I think it's what you want.

720
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:24,384
I think so too.

721
00:52:46,082 --> 00:52:47,705
I can't wait all day.

722
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:49,328
I'm leaving!

723
00:52:49,615 --> 00:52:51,607
Ah, don't be silly,
it's just two minutes to four.

724
00:52:51,651 --> 00:52:53,215
No one's coming to tea, it's too—

725
00:53:01,792 --> 00:53:03,966
It's her!

726
00:53:17,533 --> 00:53:20,084
Is this absolutely where you live,
my dearest one?

727
00:53:20,118 --> 00:53:21,737
Yes, it suits me.

728
00:53:22,451 --> 00:53:25,844
Why did I have to come alone?
Are you in love with me?

729
00:53:25,985 --> 00:53:29,890
Oh, it's the secret of Carraway castle.
Tell your chauffeur to go far away.

730
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:33,892
Come back in an hour, Ferdie.
His name is Ferdie.

731
00:53:47,433 --> 00:53:51,509
Oh my goodness!
I can't believe it.

732
00:53:53,336 --> 00:53:57,371
You? Did you ransack a greenhouse?

733
00:53:58,092 --> 00:54:00,623
He IS in love with me.

734
00:54:14,178 --> 00:54:15,391
Would you?

735
00:54:15,939 --> 00:54:18,727
— That's funny.
— What's funny?

736
00:54:27,532 --> 00:54:29,321
What are you doing?

737
00:55:19,687 --> 00:55:22,512
I'm certainly glad to see you again.

738
00:55:24,653 --> 00:55:30,222
Hi. I'm certainly glad
to see you as well.

739
00:55:58,547 --> 00:56:00,690
We've… we've uh…

740
00:56:01,424 --> 00:56:03,858
We've met before.

741
00:56:06,459 --> 00:56:10,001
I'll have someone to come
repair this immediately.

742
00:56:26,213 --> 00:56:28,432
Sorry about the clock.

743
00:56:28,753 --> 00:56:30,087
That's an old clock.

744
00:56:30,133 --> 00:56:32,598
— Lovely though, a lovely clock.
— Yes.

745
00:56:34,523 --> 00:56:38,503
— We haven't met for many years.
— Five years, next November.

746
00:56:40,858 --> 00:56:42,186
— Tea?
— Yes, thank you,

747
00:56:42,187 --> 00:56:43,991
— Darling, thank you.
— Thank you, old sport.

748
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:45,664
— Lemon or sugar?
— Neither.

749
00:56:45,711 --> 00:56:47,133
Plain, thank you.

750
00:57:06,206 --> 00:57:08,336
— I just have to pop into town.
— Town?

751
00:57:08,357 --> 00:57:10,241
— I'll be right back.
— Nick, I've…

752
00:57:10,243 --> 00:57:13,321
got to speak to you about something!
— Yes, I— I'll be right back!

753
00:57:13,729 --> 00:57:17,176
God! This is a mistake!
This is a terrible, terrible mistake!

754
00:57:17,215 --> 00:57:19,821
You're just embarrassed,
Daisy's embarrassed too.

755
00:57:21,576 --> 00:57:24,889
— She is embarrassed?
— Yes. Just as much as you are.

756
00:57:24,914 --> 00:57:26,555
Don't talk so loud!

757
00:57:26,556 --> 00:57:27,977
You're acting like a little boy!

758
00:57:27,978 --> 00:57:30,510
You're being rude, Daisy's
in there all alone, and you—

759
00:58:06,497 --> 00:58:08,876
<i>Looking over my story so far,</i>

760
00:58:08,968 --> 00:58:12,878
<i>I'm reminded that, for the
second time that summer,</i>

761
00:58:13,486 --> 00:58:16,418
<i>I was guarding other people's secrets.</i>

762
00:58:17,773 --> 00:58:22,793
<i>Once again, I was within… and without.</i>

763
00:58:51,534 --> 00:58:53,704
It stopped raining.

764
00:58:56,764 --> 00:58:59,669
Yes. It has, hasn't it?

765
00:59:12,168 --> 00:59:14,272
What do you think of that, Daisy?

766
00:59:16,173 --> 00:59:20,182
Come look.
— Oh Nicky, how funny.

767
00:59:21,457 --> 00:59:24,021
Look, it's my house.

768
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:29,411
Just there, across the bay.

769
00:59:34,922 --> 00:59:37,322
I know.

770
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:40,818
I have the same view from my place.

771
00:59:42,014 --> 00:59:44,340
Where is your place?

772
00:59:46,761 --> 00:59:50,613
Nick, I want you and Daisy
both to come over to my house.

773
00:59:50,733 --> 00:59:52,203
I'd like to show her around.

774
00:59:52,438 --> 00:59:54,239
You sure you want me to come?

775
00:59:54,447 --> 00:59:58,229
Absolutely, old sport. Absolutely.

776
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:02,966
Ladner, open the gates.
— Open the gates!

777
01:00:03,007 --> 01:00:06,181
I had the gates brought in
from a castle in Normandy.

778
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:11,823
— Oh Jay, it's so grand!
— You like it?

779
01:00:12,996 --> 01:00:14,407
I love it.

780
01:00:14,970 --> 01:00:17,997
— But how do you live here all alone?
— Well I don't.

781
01:00:18,312 --> 01:00:22,399
I keep it always full of
interesting celebrated people.

782
01:00:23,564 --> 01:00:25,735
Come with me.

783
01:00:30,174 --> 01:00:31,516
The house looks well, doesn't it?

784
01:00:31,530 --> 01:00:34,039
See the way the whole front
catches the light like that?!

785
01:00:34,089 --> 01:00:36,178
That's splendid.

786
01:00:39,128 --> 01:00:41,610
Come on, you two.
I want the Royal Tour!

787
01:00:41,671 --> 01:00:44,089
You must understand that I like
all things that are modern!

788
01:00:44,137 --> 01:00:46,702
Press the orange, it all comes out there.

789
01:00:56,313 --> 01:00:57,770
Anyone for a round of golf?

790
01:00:57,780 --> 01:01:00,086
You still know I'm a
champion golfer, don't you?

791
01:01:00,111 --> 01:01:01,267
— Great!
— Go on.

792
01:01:02,692 --> 01:01:03,592
I thought we could…

793
01:01:03,617 --> 01:01:05,611
This remarkable little camera's
the latest design.

794
01:01:05,612 --> 01:01:07,398
Let me show you,
I'll show you how it's done.

795
01:01:07,423 --> 01:01:08,747
— Alright.
— Nick, keep filming.

796
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:11,371
She's gonna take a swing.
— Get ready. Aim. Fore!

797
01:01:14,353 --> 01:01:15,289
I'm such a brute.

798
01:01:15,323 --> 01:01:17,965
— Okay, you're ready for your close-up?
— I don't want to forget a single moment.

799
01:01:17,991 --> 01:01:18,700
You're shimmering.

800
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:20,796
She look like she could be on
the cover of Vogue, don't you think?

801
01:01:20,807 --> 01:01:21,748
Turn on the camera!

802
01:01:24,873 --> 01:01:26,873
— Where did you go?
— Slow down.

803
01:01:26,898 --> 01:01:28,898
Slow down.

804
01:01:34,234 --> 01:01:36,965
— It's beautiful!
— It's a custom Wurlitzer.

805
01:01:37,046 --> 01:01:39,398
— Can anyone play that?
— Klipspringer can.

806
01:01:39,657 --> 01:01:41,595
— Someone, wake Ewing!
— Of course, sir.

807
01:01:41,623 --> 01:01:44,145
Music! And then we can dance all night.

808
01:01:44,175 --> 01:01:46,342
Ewing ​​is a funny genius,
he can play anything.

809
01:01:46,567 --> 01:01:47,989
Then I demand a Charleston.

810
01:01:47,990 --> 01:01:50,939
She makes it look so— so splendid,
don't you think, old sport?

811
01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:55,992
I have a man in England
who buys me clothes.

812
01:01:56,053 --> 01:01:58,105
I've never seen anything like this.

813
01:01:58,140 --> 01:01:59,542
Something for the lady.

814
01:02:00,225 --> 01:02:03,385
He sends over a selection
at the beginning of each season.

815
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:06,123
These are silk.

816
01:02:06,432 --> 01:02:08,744
— These are flannel.
— They're so beautiful!

817
01:02:08,841 --> 01:02:10,538
— Indian cotton.
— Stop it, Jay!

818
01:02:12,298 --> 01:02:13,248
Linen!

819
01:02:14,183 --> 01:02:17,292
— Nicky, he's a mad man!
— I can't help you!

820
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:21,112
You know you'll have to refold
every single one of them!

821
01:02:21,186 --> 01:02:22,155
You'll ruin them!

822
01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:27,867
Jay, stop it!

823
01:02:27,901 --> 01:02:29,903
— Right here!
— No, Jay!

824
01:02:47,002 --> 01:02:48,977
What is it?

825
01:02:50,829 --> 01:02:53,771
Daisy, Daisy darling, what is it?

826
01:02:58,420 --> 01:03:01,457
It makes me sad.

827
01:03:02,427 --> 01:03:05,243
— Why?
— Because…

828
01:03:09,076 --> 01:03:13,398
<i>Five lost years struggled on Daisy's lips.</i>

829
01:03:14,858 --> 01:03:18,074
<i>But all she could manage was…</i>

830
01:03:20,899 --> 01:03:22,899
Why?

831
01:03:24,038 --> 01:03:27,371
Cause I've never seen
such beautiful shirts before.

832
01:03:48,691 --> 01:03:54,115
If it wasn't for the mist,
we could see the green light.

833
01:03:59,472 --> 01:04:01,276
What green light?

834
01:04:02,503 --> 01:04:06,648
The one that burns all night
at the end of your dock.

835
01:04:09,202 --> 01:04:14,718
<i>Possibly it had occurred to Gatsby that
the colossal significance of that light</i>

836
01:04:14,748 --> 01:04:17,848
<i>had vanished forever.</i>

837
01:04:17,962 --> 01:04:21,420
<i>Now it was once again
just a green light on a dock,</i>

838
01:04:21,450 --> 01:04:26,229
<i>and his count of enchanted
object had diminished by one.</i>

839
01:04:27,677 --> 01:04:29,399
Who is this? Your father?

840
01:04:29,429 --> 01:04:32,254
Oh No. That's Mr. Dan Cody, old sport.

841
01:04:33,239 --> 01:04:34,657
He's dead now.

842
01:04:34,698 --> 01:04:37,687
He used to be my best friend
many years ago.

843
01:04:38,213 --> 01:04:41,410
You never told me you had
a pompadour or a yacht.

844
01:04:41,466 --> 01:04:43,673
I wanna show you something.

845
01:04:44,961 --> 01:04:46,900
Have a seat.

846
01:04:47,449 --> 01:04:51,359
Here's a lot of clippings I collect.
About you.

847
01:04:55,117 --> 01:04:58,011
You saved my letters.

848
01:04:58,386 --> 01:05:02,111
This was my first photo of you.

849
01:05:02,931 --> 01:05:05,768
You remember this letter, do you?
"We can't lose each other.

850
01:05:05,802 --> 01:05:08,987
And let all this glorious
love end in nothing.

851
01:05:09,075 --> 01:05:12,510
Come home.
I'll be here waiting and hoping,

852
01:05:13,012 --> 01:05:16,274
for every long dream of you to come true."

853
01:05:20,013 --> 01:05:21,822
Excuse me.
- Sir, Slagle's in Detroit.

854
01:05:30,222 --> 01:05:32,549
I can't talk now, old sport.

855
01:05:35,090 --> 01:05:39,930
He must know what a small town it is.
Listen to me! Listen to me!

856
01:05:43,817 --> 01:05:46,079
I said a small town.

857
01:05:46,704 --> 01:05:48,704
He must know what a small town is.

858
01:05:52,188 --> 01:05:56,366
Listen to me. He is of no use to us
if Detroit is his idea of ​​a small town,

859
01:05:56,379 --> 01:05:57,836
you understand?

860
01:06:03,556 --> 01:06:05,754
We'll chat later, old sport.

861
01:06:06,650 --> 01:06:08,417
Alright.

862
01:06:11,693 --> 01:06:14,015
Klipspringer.

863
01:06:14,602 --> 01:06:16,665
He must be awake.

864
01:06:19,027 --> 01:06:20,880
Shall we?

865
01:07:11,862 --> 01:07:15,227
I wish I had done everything
on earth with you.

866
01:07:21,978 --> 01:07:24,229
All my life…

867
01:07:26,424 --> 01:07:30,110
I wish it could always be like this.

868
01:07:36,396 --> 01:07:38,827
It will be.

869
01:07:42,189 --> 01:07:44,889
<i>If only it had been enough for Gatsby,</i>

870
01:07:44,957 --> 01:07:47,313
<i>just to hold Daisy.</i>

871
01:07:47,742 --> 01:07:52,550
<i>But he had a grand vision
for his life and Daisy's part in it.</i>

872
01:07:53,945 --> 01:07:59,569
<i>It wasn't until the end of that summer,
on the last night I saw Gatsby,</i>

873
01:08:00,365 --> 01:08:05,159
<i>that he told me of the life he had
dreamed for himself since he was a boy.</i>

874
01:08:05,794 --> 01:08:10,174
You see, Doctor, Gatsby's real name was…

875
01:08:12,047 --> 01:08:13,764
James Gatz.

876
01:08:14,801 --> 01:08:19,447
<i>His parents were dirt-poor
farmers from North Dakota.</i>

877
01:08:20,023 --> 01:08:23,195
<i>He never accepted them
as his parents at all.</i>

878
01:08:23,907 --> 01:08:27,686
<i>In his own imagination,
he was a son of God.</i>

879
01:08:29,276 --> 01:08:32,140
<i>Destined for future glory.</i>

880
01:08:32,864 --> 01:08:38,377
<i>Chasing this destiny,
a 16-year-old Gatz ran far, far away.</i>

881
01:08:38,715 --> 01:08:43,714
<i>One afternoon, off the coast of Lake
Superior, he spotted a yacht in peril.</i>

882
01:08:43,788 --> 01:08:49,514
<i>He rode out and rescued the vessel and its
captain, alcoholic millionaire Dan Cody.</i>

883
01:08:52,702 --> 01:08:55,660
You're gonna hit the shoal! Come on
sir, we're gonna hit the shoal!

884
01:08:55,761 --> 01:08:59,775
What the hell are you doing, old sport?

885
01:08:59,811 --> 01:09:03,251
<i>This was his opportunity,
and he seized it.</i>

886
01:09:03,295 --> 01:09:07,041
And I decided right then and there,
to call myself Jay Gatsby.

887
01:09:07,102 --> 01:09:11,191
<i>He sailed the yacht out of danger
and into his future.</i>

888
01:09:11,298 --> 01:09:17,063
<i>Gatsby showed skill and ambition,
and for five years, they sailed the world.</i>

889
01:09:17,725 --> 01:09:20,614
He was alright, old Dane.
He taught me everything.

890
01:09:20,803 --> 01:09:23,683
— <i>How to dress, act and speak…</i>
— Gatsby.

891
01:09:23,977 --> 01:09:25,745
— <i>…like a gentleman</i>
— Jay Gatsby.

892
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:27,040
She looks well, don't she!

893
01:09:27,081 --> 01:09:29,960
<i>Gatsby hoped to inherit Cody's fortune.</i>
— Old sport.

894
01:09:30,010 --> 01:09:35,167
<i>But when Cody died, Gatsby was cheated
of his inheritance by Cody's family.</i>

895
01:09:35,479 --> 01:09:38,765
He'd been left with the ability
to play the gentleman,

896
01:09:38,820 --> 01:09:42,376
but he was once again dirt poor.

897
01:09:44,881 --> 01:09:50,531
<i>By mid-summer, Gatsby was front page news.</i>

898
01:10:01,425 --> 01:10:04,270
<i>Where did the money come from?</i>

899
01:10:17,382 --> 01:10:20,258
<i>That's what the whole of
New York wanted to know.</i>

900
01:10:20,359 --> 01:10:23,696
<i>And it was the same
question on Tom's mind,</i>

901
01:10:24,011 --> 01:10:28,166
<i>when he accompanied Daisy
to one of Gatsby's…</i>

902
01:10:28,246 --> 01:10:30,007
<i>…glittering parties.</i>
Take a look around.

903
01:10:30,774 --> 01:10:32,085
I'll be right back.

904
01:10:32,867 --> 01:10:36,358
You know, a lot of these newly rich people
are just filthy booze makers.

905
01:10:36,641 --> 01:10:40,541
Not Gatsby. He's a businessman,
he owned a lot of drugstores.

906
01:10:40,797 --> 01:10:42,982
— Businessman!
— May I introduce Senator Gulick.

907
01:10:43,081 --> 01:10:45,680
This is Mr. Carraway.
— Senator.

908
01:10:46,462 --> 01:10:48,099
Mrs. Buchanan.

909
01:10:48,188 --> 01:10:50,268
— Charmed.
— Delighted.

910
01:10:50,574 --> 01:10:53,594
Oh and Mr. Buchanan,
the polo player.

911
01:10:55,957 --> 01:10:56,771
No, not me.

912
01:10:56,798 --> 01:10:58,903
Always a pleasure to meet a Buchanan.

913
01:10:58,943 --> 01:10:59,650
Likewise.

914
01:10:59,677 --> 01:11:02,089
Senator, I'll catch you up later,
perhaps at the crap table.

915
01:11:02,099 --> 01:11:03,917
I'd rather not be the polo player.

916
01:11:03,996 --> 01:11:07,145
Tom, you should be proud
of your achievements.

917
01:11:09,379 --> 01:11:12,624
— May I show you around?
— Sure.

918
01:11:14,597 --> 01:11:17,349
You must know the faces of
many people you've heard of.

919
01:11:17,381 --> 01:11:18,179
Absolutely.

920
01:11:18,206 --> 01:11:22,143
We don't go around very much. I don't
think I recognize a single person.

921
01:11:22,165 --> 01:11:25,138
Is that so? Perhaps you know
that lady right there.

922
01:11:25,184 --> 01:11:28,311
It's Marlene Moon!
I adore her pictures.

923
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:31,860
Would you like me to introduce you?

924
01:11:32,450 --> 01:11:35,077
I'd really rather not be the Polo player.

925
01:11:41,522 --> 01:11:43,961
All these things excite me so.

926
01:11:44,698 --> 01:11:46,842
Nice little dance.

927
01:11:49,546 --> 01:11:53,726
I believe we've met before, Mr. Buchanan.
About a month ago.

928
01:11:56,352 --> 01:11:58,200
That's right!

929
01:11:58,458 --> 01:12:01,386
And you were with Nick, here.
The barber shop.

930
01:12:02,306 --> 01:12:05,925
That's right.
You see, I know your wife.

931
01:12:08,807 --> 01:12:11,610
— Is that so?
— Yes.

932
01:12:15,966 --> 01:12:19,685
Mr. Gatsby, sir.
Mr. Slagle is here.

933
01:12:19,686 --> 01:12:22,165
No, not now!
— … and guitars with…

934
01:12:22,941 --> 01:12:25,851
…the Foxtrot.

935
01:12:39,285 --> 01:12:43,906
Mr. Buchanan.
Would you mind terribly?

936
01:12:46,869 --> 01:12:48,635
Of course not.

937
01:12:51,725 --> 01:12:54,699
I think I can keep myself amused.

938
01:12:55,637 --> 01:12:58,568
In case you need to
take down any addresses.

939
01:13:11,593 --> 01:13:14,095
Please move aside. Excuse me.

940
01:13:17,544 --> 01:13:19,404
Another swell party, Jay.

941
01:13:19,405 --> 01:13:22,289
Be careful for the snake charmer,
Mr. McLennahan.

942
01:13:22,878 --> 01:13:26,320
Is all this made entirely
from your own imagination?

943
01:13:27,453 --> 01:13:29,095
No.

944
01:13:30,146 --> 01:13:32,941
See, you were there all along.

945
01:13:33,149 --> 01:13:35,448
In every idea.

946
01:13:35,656 --> 01:13:37,568
Every decision.

947
01:13:38,458 --> 01:13:41,918
Of course, if anything is not
your liking, I'll change it.

948
01:13:45,002 --> 01:13:47,375
It's perfect.

949
01:13:47,488 --> 01:13:51,013
From your perfect
irresistible imagination.

950
01:13:56,031 --> 01:13:58,638
I wonder where the devil he met her.

951
01:14:07,650 --> 01:14:10,288
— I'll find you.
— Alright.

952
01:14:14,834 --> 01:14:16,711
Come with me.

953
01:14:19,036 --> 01:14:21,036
Coming through, please.
Pardon me.

954
01:14:24,261 --> 01:14:25,958
Thank you.

955
01:15:48,419 --> 01:15:50,470
Have you seen my wife?

956
01:15:52,412 --> 01:15:54,206
No.

957
01:15:54,547 --> 01:15:57,043
Not for a while.

958
01:15:59,306 --> 01:16:03,335
Whiskey. It's funny, the Senator
just saw her down here.

959
01:16:08,241 --> 01:16:10,934
I wish we could just run away.

960
01:16:19,906 --> 01:16:22,739
Run away?
No.

961
01:16:23,265 --> 01:16:27,358
Daisy, darling, that…
that wouldn't be respectable.

962
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:29,756
You live around here, Nick?

963
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:35,159
— Just next door.
— Is that so?

964
01:16:39,121 --> 01:16:45,812
We're gonna live here.
In this house. You and me.

965
01:16:49,050 --> 01:16:50,975
Darling…

966
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:55,626
It's time to tell Tom.

967
01:16:58,051 --> 01:17:00,051
Come on boys, it's too late!

968
01:17:00,615 --> 01:17:02,759
Good night, gentlemen!

969
01:17:03,340 --> 01:17:05,462
What a circus.

970
01:17:08,486 --> 01:17:14,209
Well, if you see her, I'll be
looking for her. You tell her.

971
01:17:16,107 --> 01:17:17,907
Remember how much fun we had?

972
01:17:17,947 --> 01:17:20,614
I don't know why we can't
just have fun like that again.

973
01:17:20,655 --> 01:17:22,482
Hello?

974
01:17:24,874 --> 01:17:27,864
Hello, Nicky. We're having a row.

975
01:17:27,865 --> 01:17:30,917
— What about?
— About things.

976
01:17:32,444 --> 01:17:34,648
About the future.

977
01:17:35,804 --> 01:17:38,124
The future of the Colored Empires.

978
01:17:39,597 --> 01:17:42,665
It's Tom, he's wandering
around the party,

979
01:17:42,787 --> 01:17:43,785
 looking for—
— Sir.

980
01:17:44,521 --> 01:17:49,175
Mr. Gatsby, sir. It's Mr. Slagle.
He's quite emotional.

981
01:17:50,619 --> 01:17:52,286
Excuse me.

982
01:17:55,732 --> 01:17:58,695
Nick. Would you mind terribly?

983
01:17:58,783 --> 01:18:00,843
Of course.

984
01:18:03,557 --> 01:18:07,706
<i>Gatsby disappeared to deal
with a dispute of some sort.</i>

985
01:18:09,662 --> 01:18:11,888
<i>Daisy waited.</i>

986
01:18:15,137 --> 01:18:18,656
<i>But Gatsby was unable to return.</i>

987
01:18:20,756 --> 01:18:23,848
With these hot-headed types
in here, I rely on you.

988
01:18:24,174 --> 01:18:25,600
But you were not available.

989
01:18:26,038 --> 01:18:28,776
A scene was made.
What's going on with you, Jay?

990
01:18:32,219 --> 01:18:34,704
— Where were you?
— With Nicky.

991
01:18:34,787 --> 01:18:37,488
Mr. Gatsby was showing us the grounds.

992
01:18:37,617 --> 01:18:41,471
He certainly must have strained
himself to get this menagerie together.

993
01:18:43,861 --> 01:18:47,590
I'd like to know who he is.
What he does.

994
01:18:48,342 --> 01:18:51,674
And I think I'll make a point
of finding out.

995
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:13,470
— I'm not sure. Ask them in the kitchen.
— To the left.

996
01:19:13,495 --> 01:19:16,595
Yeah, we'll pile that stuff in the garage,
it's going back to town.

997
01:19:30,088 --> 01:19:32,815
Oh, there you are!
Daisy just left.

998
01:19:32,856 --> 01:19:35,762
She asked me to tell you
she had a wonderful time.

999
01:19:35,978 --> 01:19:37,230
She didn't like it.

1000
01:19:37,495 --> 01:19:40,311
— Of course she did!
— No, no no.

1001
01:19:41,077 --> 01:19:44,864
No, she didn't like it, she…
she did not have a good time, I…

1002
01:19:45,448 --> 01:19:47,460
feel so far away from her now.

1003
01:19:47,502 --> 01:19:49,148
So hard to make her understand.

1004
01:19:49,295 --> 01:19:52,755
— You mean about the party?
— The party?

1005
01:19:54,194 --> 01:19:56,455
I couldn't care less
about the parties.

1006
01:19:56,670 --> 01:19:58,760
That will be all for now, gentlemen.

1007
01:19:58,761 --> 01:19:59,882
Thank you.
— Thank you, sir.

1008
01:20:00,892 --> 01:20:02,826
You see…

1009
01:20:04,285 --> 01:20:07,269
She has to tell Tom that
she never loved him.

1010
01:20:07,318 --> 01:20:08,750
— What?
— Yes.

1011
01:20:09,462 --> 01:20:12,985
Then we can go back to Louisville
to her parents' house.

1012
01:20:13,254 --> 01:20:15,888
Her parents are lovely people, old sport.

1013
01:20:16,099 --> 01:20:18,405
We'll be married there.

1014
01:20:18,747 --> 01:20:24,191
See… See, Daisy and I are gonna
start over just as if it were 5 years ago.

1015
01:20:24,248 --> 01:20:25,927
I wouldn't ask too much of her.

1016
01:20:26,001 --> 01:20:27,987
— Wouldn't ask too much?
— No.

1017
01:20:32,807 --> 01:20:35,442
I beg your pardon, old sport, it just…

1018
01:20:35,863 --> 01:20:40,033
it's so sad because it is so hard
to make her understand.

1019
01:20:40,509 --> 01:20:42,998
It's so hard to make
her understand.

1020
01:20:42,999 --> 01:20:46,025
I've gotten all these things for her,
I've gotten all these things for her,

1021
01:20:46,048 --> 01:20:48,937
now she just…
she just wants to run away.

1022
01:20:50,256 --> 01:20:51,860
She even wants to leave that.

1023
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:55,912
Jay! You can't repeat the past.

1024
01:20:57,407 --> 01:21:00,581
— Can't repeat the past?
— No.

1025
01:21:01,997 --> 01:21:06,093
Why, of course you can.
Of course you can.

1026
01:21:07,938 --> 01:21:11,402
See, I'm gonna fix things,
just the way they were before.

1027
01:21:11,610 --> 01:21:15,548
Everything's been so…
so confused since that night.

1028
01:21:16,988 --> 01:21:19,260
<i>He talked a lot about the past.</i>

1029
01:21:20,054 --> 01:21:22,584
<i>As if he wanted to recover something.</i>

1030
01:21:23,082 --> 01:21:27,405
If I c— if I could just
get back to the start.

1031
01:21:29,247 --> 01:21:33,973
If I could just get back to the start…
I could find it again.

1032
01:21:34,047 --> 01:21:39,139
<i>Some vision of himself that
he'd put into loving Daisy.</i>

1033
01:21:40,575 --> 01:21:44,412
<i>One night in Louisville, five years ago,</i>

1034
01:21:44,460 --> 01:21:49,326
<i>Gatsby found himself at Daisy's
house by colossal accident.</i>

1035
01:21:49,727 --> 01:21:53,518
So I went to her house first, with
some of the officers from Camp Taylor.

1036
01:21:54,147 --> 01:21:56,903
I'd never been in such
a beautiful house before.

1037
01:21:56,928 --> 01:21:58,242
May I save the next dance?

1038
01:21:58,243 --> 01:22:02,891
<i>His uniform hid the truth,
that he was a penniless young man,</i>

1039
01:22:03,472 --> 01:22:06,787
<i>with only that grand vision of himself.</i>

1040
01:22:06,816 --> 01:22:09,150
— Daisy, don't scamper.
— I was not, mother.

1041
01:22:09,185 --> 01:22:11,196
So many dashing young officers here,

1042
01:22:11,253 --> 01:22:13,998
and from such illustrious families.

1043
01:22:14,118 --> 01:22:17,290
I always knew that I could climb.

1044
01:22:17,325 --> 01:22:20,177
But I could only climb if I climbed alone.

1045
01:22:24,136 --> 01:22:28,467
I knew that when I kissed this girl…

1046
01:22:30,697 --> 01:22:33,538
I would be forever wed to her.

1047
01:22:37,470 --> 01:22:39,839
So I stopped.

1048
01:22:41,251 --> 01:22:44,988
I stopped, and I…
I waited.

1049
01:22:46,871 --> 01:22:49,609
I waited for a moment longer.

1050
01:22:49,709 --> 01:22:55,231
<i>He knew his mind would never again
be free to romp like…</i>

1051
01:22:56,994 --> 01:23:01,119
<i>the mind of God.</i>

1052
01:23:02,327 --> 01:23:06,224
<i>That falling in love
would change his destiny…</i>

1053
01:23:07,185 --> 01:23:09,605
<i>for ever.</i>

1054
01:23:12,784 --> 01:23:15,783
Αnd then I just let myself go.

1055
01:23:23,994 --> 01:23:27,097
<i>She blossomed for him like a flower…</i>

1056
01:23:29,561 --> 01:23:32,795
<i>and the incarnation was complete.</i>

1057
01:23:41,941 --> 01:23:45,757
I knew it was a great mistake
for a man like me to fall in love.

1058
01:23:46,393 --> 01:23:52,454
I'm only 32, I might still be a great man if
I can forget that I once lost Daisy, but…

1059
01:23:52,488 --> 01:23:57,650
my life, old sport, my life…
My life has got to be like this.

1060
01:24:02,347 --> 01:24:04,991
It's got to keep going up.

1061
01:24:10,418 --> 01:24:16,221
She has to go to Tom…
and tell him that she never loved him.

1062
01:24:21,326 --> 01:24:25,487
I just need to give her more time,
old sport. More time.

1063
01:24:31,953 --> 01:24:36,426
Don't worry old sport, don't worry.
I can protect her here.

1064
01:24:39,109 --> 01:24:41,040
Good night, old sport.

1065
01:24:49,230 --> 01:24:52,225
You're wrong about the past, old sport!

1066
01:24:54,389 --> 01:24:56,209
You're wrong.

1067
01:25:20,133 --> 01:25:22,737
<i>There had been music from
my neighbor's all summer.</i>

1068
01:25:23,067 --> 01:25:26,173
<i>In his blue gardens, men and
girls came and went like moths,</i>

1069
01:25:26,217 --> 01:25:29,328
<i>among the whisperings and
the laughter and the stars.</i>

1070
01:25:30,281 --> 01:25:33,959
— Breakfast?
— Yes. Thank you, thank you.

1071
01:25:35,378 --> 01:25:38,506
Laughter.
Thank you.

1072
01:25:39,907 --> 01:25:43,667
No, the whispering and the—
the champagne and the stars.

1073
01:25:45,065 --> 01:25:46,993
But…

1074
01:25:47,170 --> 01:25:54,085
<i>After Tom and Daisy's visit,
Gatsby's lights went out one by one.</i>

1075
01:25:54,855 --> 01:25:57,626
<i>There were no more parties.</i>

1076
01:25:59,388 --> 01:26:02,530
<i>Daisy visited discreetly.</i>

1077
01:26:05,339 --> 01:26:11,595
<i>For the very same fame that had all summer
been a source of satisfaction to Jay Gatsby,</i>

1078
01:26:12,428 --> 01:26:14,878
<i>had become a threat.</i>

1079
01:26:43,561 --> 01:26:45,628
I don't wanna go home.

1080
01:26:48,594 --> 01:26:51,294
I— I heard you fired all your servants.

1081
01:26:51,741 --> 01:26:54,673
Daisy comes over sometimes
in the afternoon,

1082
01:26:54,685 --> 01:27:00,487
I wanted people who wouldn't gossip
until we decide what we're going to do.

1083
01:27:01,085 --> 01:27:04,966
You see, these towns are
very close together, old sport.

1084
01:27:05,315 --> 01:27:07,927
If it gets in the papers, you understand?

1085
01:27:07,981 --> 01:27:11,308
They're all people Wolfsheim
wanted to do something for.

1086
01:27:11,769 --> 01:27:15,734
What's the difference as long as
they can cook and make beds, right?

1087
01:27:19,392 --> 01:27:21,928
Nick, Daisy's ready.

1088
01:27:21,971 --> 01:27:25,498
She's ready, there's just…
one thing she's requesting,

1089
01:27:25,506 --> 01:27:29,866
that you and Mrs Baker be there
for lunch tomorrow at her house.

1090
01:27:31,581 --> 01:27:34,107
Will you come, old sport?

1091
01:27:34,331 --> 01:27:36,213
Daisy needs you.

1092
01:27:39,843 --> 01:27:42,147
We need you.

1093
01:27:48,578 --> 01:27:51,047
Will you come, old sport?

1094
01:28:07,541 --> 01:28:12,057
You know, I read somewhere that
the sun is getting hotter every year.

1095
01:28:13,354 --> 01:28:16,357
Wait a minute. It's the opposite.

1096
01:28:16,701 --> 01:28:19,376
The sun is getting colder every year.

1097
01:28:21,046 --> 01:28:25,458
Oh I would like to be out
on that bay today.

1098
01:28:28,188 --> 01:28:30,434
I'm right across from you.

1099
01:28:33,321 --> 01:28:35,293
Right there.

1100
01:28:40,425 --> 01:28:42,192
So you are.

1101
01:28:47,234 --> 01:28:55,093
You see, every night I can see that
light at the end of your dock blinking.

1102
01:28:56,783 --> 01:28:58,738
What light?

1103
01:29:06,481 --> 01:29:09,721
You see, Mr. Buchanan,
I wanted to be close…

1104
01:29:15,252 --> 01:29:17,025
Daisy and I have—
— It's so hot!

1105
01:29:17,159 --> 01:29:19,203
Everything's so confused!

1106
01:29:19,291 --> 01:29:21,363
What'll we do with ourselves
this afternoon or,

1107
01:29:21,401 --> 01:29:23,355
the day after that, or
for the next thirty years?

1108
01:29:23,463 --> 01:29:25,637
Oh, don't be morbid.

1109
01:29:25,638 --> 01:29:27,375
Let's go to town.
Who wants to go to town?

1110
01:29:27,376 --> 01:29:28,699
Town?

1111
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:32,181
Oh! Women get these notions!

1112
01:29:51,220 --> 01:29:53,023
Daisy?

1113
01:29:58,024 --> 01:30:00,160
You look so cool.

1114
01:30:02,548 --> 01:30:05,029
He always looks so cool.

1115
01:30:05,523 --> 01:30:08,683
Like the advertisement
of the man in Times Square.

1116
01:30:10,424 --> 01:30:13,460
The man in the cool beautiful shirts.

1117
01:30:19,664 --> 01:30:22,543
<i>She had told Gatsby that she loved him.</i>

1118
01:30:24,377 --> 01:30:26,242
<i>And Tom had seen it.</i>

1119
01:30:26,549 --> 01:30:28,319
Let's go to town!

1120
01:30:28,607 --> 01:30:31,060
I'm perfectly willing.
It's a marvelous idea.

1121
01:30:31,093 --> 01:30:32,738
Henry, have the car
brought around now.

1122
01:30:32,775 --> 01:30:35,146
Just like that? Can't anyone
at least have a cigarette first?

1123
01:30:35,175 --> 01:30:36,554
We smoked all through lunch.

1124
01:30:36,579 --> 01:30:39,558
Come on, let's have fun.
It's too hot to fuss.

1125
01:30:39,611 --> 01:30:43,358
Daisy, it was your great idea!
Why don't we? Let's all go to town?

1126
01:30:43,434 --> 01:30:45,536
I changed my mind, you brute.

1127
01:30:45,579 --> 01:30:48,374
Oh come on, we'll get a
great big room at the Plaza.

1128
01:30:49,170 --> 01:30:53,937
A bucket of ice, a bottle of whiskey
and it will be fun.

1129
01:30:54,184 --> 01:30:57,138
Come on. It was your idea.

1130
01:30:58,461 --> 01:31:00,437
Fine. Have it your own way, Tom.

1131
01:31:00,684 --> 01:31:02,907
Come on, Jordan.

1132
01:31:07,163 --> 01:31:09,564
Will you join us, Mr. Gatsby?

1133
01:31:10,029 --> 01:31:12,521
Two bottles of whiskey,
wrap them in a towel.

1134
01:31:12,534 --> 01:31:13,805
Come on, Nick!

1135
01:31:18,797 --> 01:31:22,506
Mr. Gatsby, would you be good
enough to take my coupé,

1136
01:31:22,541 --> 01:31:24,840
 and I'll drive everyone
else in your circus wagon.

1137
01:31:24,870 --> 01:31:27,650
I don't think there's much gas, old sport.

1138
01:31:27,683 --> 01:31:29,628
Nope, plenty o' gas.

1139
01:31:29,639 --> 01:31:32,092
Well, if I run out,
I'll stop at a drugstore.

1140
01:31:32,225 --> 01:31:35,464
I hear you can buy anything
at a drugstore nowadays.

1141
01:31:36,245 --> 01:31:39,918
— You take Nick and Jordan.
— I suppose you can, yes.

1142
01:31:39,951 --> 01:31:41,840
We'll meet you at the Plaza.

1143
01:31:41,886 --> 01:31:45,292
I'll be the man in the corner,
smoking two cigarettes.

1144
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:54,133
You must think I'm
pretty dumb, don't you?

1145
01:31:54,152 --> 01:31:57,064
But I have a second sight sometimes
that tells me what to do.

1146
01:31:57,101 --> 01:31:59,303
I've made a small investigation
into this fellow.

1147
01:31:59,330 --> 01:32:00,911
And you found he was an Oxford man?

1148
01:32:00,937 --> 01:32:04,329
Oxford, New Mexico.
He wears a pink suit, for Christ sake.

1149
01:32:29,012 --> 01:32:31,876
Tom, we're almost out of gas.

1150
01:32:39,684 --> 01:32:43,388
Wilson? What are you waiting for?
Let's have some gas!

1151
01:32:44,163 --> 01:32:45,970
Do I have to do it myself?

1152
01:32:46,001 --> 01:32:47,479
Do you think I come here
to admire the view?

1153
01:32:47,502 --> 01:32:49,127
Sorry uh, I'm sick.

1154
01:32:49,263 --> 01:32:50,742
Why?

1155
01:32:50,923 --> 01:32:52,102
Why, what's the matter?

1156
01:32:52,143 --> 01:32:54,976
I don't know, I'm… I all run down.

1157
01:32:55,125 --> 01:32:56,491
I need money real bad.

1158
01:32:56,756 --> 01:32:59,814
— What?
— My wife and I, we wanna go west.

1159
01:33:01,478 --> 01:33:03,813
Oh, your wife does?

1160
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:07,229
<i>Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic.</i>

1161
01:33:07,871 --> 01:33:12,156
<i>His mistress and wife,
an hour ago so secure,</i>

1162
01:33:12,224 --> 01:33:15,404
<i>were both slipping
from his control.</i>

1163
01:33:15,454 --> 01:33:18,906
I wised up to something funny
these last two days.

1164
01:33:19,946 --> 01:33:23,746
There she is. She's going West,
whether she wants it or not.

1165
01:33:24,668 --> 01:33:28,311
— What do I owe you?
— A dollar. A dollar twenty.

1166
01:33:28,533 --> 01:33:31,058
You can have the car.
I'll send it over tomorrow.

1167
01:34:24,946 --> 01:34:26,953
Fine! Fine, fine.

1168
01:34:28,301 --> 01:34:30,308
Open another window.

1169
01:34:30,414 --> 01:34:31,552
There aren't any more.

1170
01:34:31,667 --> 01:34:34,055
Then telephone for an axe.

1171
01:34:34,102 --> 01:34:37,962
Will you forget about the heat?!
You make it worse by crabbing about it.

1172
01:34:38,079 --> 01:34:40,983
Why not let her alone, old sport?

1173
01:34:42,487 --> 01:34:45,447
That's a great expression
of yours, isn't it?

1174
01:34:45,541 --> 01:34:46,441
What is?

1175
01:34:47,287 --> 01:34:50,117
'Old sport'. Where did you pick it up?

1176
01:34:50,225 --> 01:34:52,508
Now see here, Tom, if you're
gonna make personal remarks,

1177
01:34:52,528 --> 01:34:53,807
I won't stay here a minute.

1178
01:34:54,280 --> 01:34:58,596
Mr. Gatsby, I understand
you're an Oxford man.

1179
01:35:02,802 --> 01:35:04,197
No. Not exactly, no.

1180
01:35:04,297 --> 01:35:07,575
Oh yes, I understand that
you went to Oxford.

1181
01:35:08,959 --> 01:35:10,289
Uh yes, I went there.

1182
01:35:10,364 --> 01:35:13,987
Sure. The man in the
pink suit went to Oxford.

1183
01:35:14,009 --> 01:35:15,386
Tom!

1184
01:35:15,587 --> 01:35:17,222
I said I went there, didn't I?

1185
01:35:17,364 --> 01:35:20,924
Oh, I heard you.
I'd like to know when.

1186
01:35:21,496 --> 01:35:23,276
You'd like to know when?

1187
01:35:33,649 --> 01:35:35,825
Well, Mr. Gatsby?

1188
01:35:37,874 --> 01:35:40,835
It was in 1919,
I only stayed there 5 months,

1189
01:35:40,852 --> 01:35:44,535
that's why I can't exactly
call myself an Oxford man.

1190
01:35:44,562 --> 01:35:48,138
You see, it was an opportunity they
gave to some of us officers who—

1191
01:35:48,175 --> 01:35:49,405
who fought in the war.

1192
01:35:50,578 --> 01:35:53,852
<i>I wanted to get up and
slap Gatsby on the back.</i>

1193
01:35:53,932 --> 01:35:55,569
I'll make you a drink, Tom.

1194
01:35:56,167 --> 01:35:57,815
Then you won't seem
so stupid to yourself.

1195
01:35:57,884 --> 01:35:59,359
Wait a minute.

1196
01:35:59,493 --> 01:36:02,725
I wanna ask Mr. Gatsby
one more question.

1197
01:36:02,731 --> 01:36:05,018
Oh, please! Please go on,
Mr. Buchanan, go on.

1198
01:36:05,466 --> 01:36:09,981
What kind of a row are you trying
to cause in my house anyhow?

1199
01:36:10,015 --> 01:36:12,369
He isn't causing a row.
You're causing a row.

1200
01:36:12,753 --> 01:36:14,274
Please have a little self-control.

1201
01:36:14,375 --> 01:36:15,768
Self-control!

1202
01:36:15,967 --> 01:36:19,393
Oh! I suppose the latest
thing is to sit back

1203
01:36:19,406 --> 01:36:23,246
and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere
make love to your wife.

1204
01:36:23,412 --> 01:36:26,184
Well, if that's the idea,
you can count me out.

1205
01:36:26,747 --> 01:36:31,729
See, nowadays people begin by sneering
at family life and family institutions,

1206
01:36:31,802 --> 01:36:34,458
and the next you'll know, we'll
throw everything overboard,

1207
01:36:34,492 --> 01:36:36,744
and we'll have intermarriage
between black and white!

1208
01:36:36,770 --> 01:36:39,056
Your wife doesn't love you!

1209
01:36:44,343 --> 01:36:47,533
She never loved you.
You see, she loves me.

1210
01:36:52,189 --> 01:36:55,166
— You must be crazy.
— No, old sport.

1211
01:36:55,585 --> 01:36:59,072
No, you see… she never loved you.

1212
01:36:59,329 --> 01:37:02,673
She only married you because I was
poor and she was tired of waiting,

1213
01:37:02,690 --> 01:37:06,264
it was a terrible, terrible mistake,
but in her heart,

1214
01:37:07,052 --> 01:37:09,525
in her heart she never
loved any one but me.

1215
01:37:09,581 --> 01:37:10,861
— We should go.
— Stay.

1216
01:37:10,895 --> 01:37:12,768
— Let's all go home.
— Sit down, Daisy!

1217
01:37:12,823 --> 01:37:15,822
Please. Please take a seat.

1218
01:37:16,426 --> 01:37:18,356
Come on, Daisy.

1219
01:37:19,563 --> 01:37:20,867
Daisy?

1220
01:37:22,249 --> 01:37:23,136
What's been going on?

1221
01:37:23,178 --> 01:37:25,802
— I wanna hear all about it.
— I've just told you what's going on,

1222
01:37:25,824 --> 01:37:27,716
it's been going on for five years.

1223
01:37:27,924 --> 01:37:32,298
You've been seeing him… for five years?

1224
01:37:32,355 --> 01:37:35,068
No, no. No, not seeing.
Not seeing, we couldn't but…

1225
01:37:35,084 --> 01:37:38,070
both of us loved each other
all that time, didn't we?

1226
01:37:39,112 --> 01:37:40,763
Oh, that's all?

1227
01:37:42,042 --> 01:37:43,326
You're crazy!

1228
01:37:43,469 --> 01:37:45,951
I can't speak about what
happened five years ago.

1229
01:37:46,094 --> 01:37:47,764
Because I didn't
know Daisy then.

1230
01:37:47,871 --> 01:37:51,021
And I'll be damned if I know
how you got within a mile of her,

1231
01:37:51,064 --> 01:37:54,127
unless you brought the groceries
to the back door,

1232
01:37:54,162 --> 01:37:59,117
but all the rest of that is a goddamn lie!
Daisy loved me when she married me,

1233
01:37:59,170 --> 01:38:00,733
and she loves me now.

1234
01:38:00,941 --> 01:38:01,782
— No! No.
— She does!

1235
01:38:01,783 --> 01:38:03,894
— I'm sorry, Mr. Buchanan.
— She does though!

1236
01:38:03,931 --> 01:38:05,136
— No.
— Oh no no, she does though,

1237
01:38:05,157 --> 01:38:07,317
she does, and what's more,
I love Daisy too.

1238
01:38:13,264 --> 01:38:16,654
Though once in a while, I— I go off
on a spree, I always come back.

1239
01:38:16,670 --> 01:38:18,822
— A spree!
— And in my heart I love—

1240
01:38:18,842 --> 01:38:21,120
— I love her all the time.
— You're revolting.

1241
01:38:21,185 --> 01:38:23,157
Do you know why we left Chicago?

1242
01:38:23,239 --> 01:38:26,064
I'm surprised they didn't treat you
to the story of that little spree.

1243
01:38:26,103 --> 01:38:28,875
Alright, that's all over now,
Daisy, darling, that's all over!

1244
01:38:28,941 --> 01:38:32,308
Just tell them the truth, go on.
That you never loved him…

1245
01:38:32,374 --> 01:38:35,320
and this… this will all
be wiped out forever.

1246
01:38:35,354 --> 01:38:36,842
Why, how could I love him, possibly!

1247
01:38:37,566 --> 01:38:40,211
Remember our plan, tell him
that you never loved him,

1248
01:38:40,222 --> 01:38:42,120
and all this pain will be
wiped out forever.

1249
01:38:44,656 --> 01:38:46,006
Daisy.

1250
01:38:47,121 --> 01:38:48,568
Daisy, tell him.

1251
01:38:49,372 --> 01:38:51,566
I never loved him?

1252
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:53,660
Never?

1253
01:38:53,988 --> 01:38:56,237
— No.
— No.

1254
01:38:57,077 --> 01:38:59,392
Not at Kapiolani?

1255
01:39:02,704 --> 01:39:06,829
Not that day I carried you down from
the Punch Bowl to keep your shoes dry?

1256
01:39:10,885 --> 01:39:12,457
Never?

1257
01:39:12,509 --> 01:39:14,626
Please don't.

1258
01:39:14,870 --> 01:39:16,647
Daisy.

1259
01:39:17,353 --> 01:39:21,086
No, Jay! You want too much.

1260
01:39:21,356 --> 01:39:25,035
I love you now, isn't that enough?
I can't help what's past.

1261
01:39:25,115 --> 01:39:28,775
I did love him once—
but I loved you too.

1262
01:39:30,643 --> 01:39:34,289
You— you loved— you loved me <i>too</i>?
You loved me…

1263
01:39:34,586 --> 01:39:37,244
Even that is a lie! She did
not know that you were alive!

1264
01:39:37,273 --> 01:39:40,183
There are things between Daisy and me,
Gatsby, that you'll never know!

1265
01:39:40,211 --> 01:39:41,929
Things that neither of us
can ever forget!

1266
01:39:41,953 --> 01:39:44,058
I just need to speak to
Daisy alone. You see, you—

1267
01:39:44,082 --> 01:39:47,935
you've got her all excited now,
don't you old sport.

1268
01:39:47,999 --> 01:39:48,877
Daisy, hey—

1269
01:39:48,931 --> 01:39:51,890
Even alone I can't say I never loved Tom,
it wouldn't be true.

1270
01:39:52,217 --> 01:39:54,690
— Of course it wouldn't.
— As if it mattered to you.

1271
01:39:54,734 --> 01:39:57,773
Of course it matters. Daisy, I'm gonna
take better care of you from now on.

1272
01:39:57,791 --> 01:39:59,696
You're not taking
care of Daisy anymore.

1273
01:40:00,419 --> 01:40:02,118
— She's leaving you.
— Nonsense!

1274
01:40:02,150 --> 01:40:04,001
— I am though!
— No no no no no.

1275
01:40:04,033 --> 01:40:05,364
No, she is not leaving me.

1276
01:40:05,461 --> 01:40:09,028
And certainly not for a
common swindler like you.

1277
01:40:09,070 --> 01:40:11,371
Mr. Gatsby, exactly who are you, anyhow?

1278
01:40:11,438 --> 01:40:13,968
You see, I have made a small
investigation into your affairs,

1279
01:40:14,130 --> 01:40:16,219
You're one of Meyer
Wolfsheim's bunch.

1280
01:40:16,255 --> 01:40:17,312
Please, let's go home!

1281
01:40:17,346 --> 01:40:21,017
See, he ​​and this Wolfsheim,
they bought up a lot of drugstores,

1282
01:40:21,252 --> 01:40:23,798
and sold bootleg alcohol over the counter.

1283
01:40:23,824 --> 01:40:25,165
What about it, old sport?

1284
01:40:25,199 --> 01:40:26,493
Don't you call me 'old sport'!

1285
01:40:26,523 --> 01:40:29,081
And this drugstore business
is just small change

1286
01:40:29,113 --> 01:40:32,199
compared to this bonds stunt that
you and Wolfsheim have got going.

1287
01:40:32,235 --> 01:40:34,816
Your friend Walter Chase
isn't too proud to come in on it.

1288
01:40:34,836 --> 01:40:36,324
I was giving it lots of thoughts.

1289
01:40:36,325 --> 01:40:38,956
How does a reputable
banker like Walter Chase,

1290
01:40:38,963 --> 01:40:41,063
find himself up to his eyeballs in debt—

1291
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:43,305
— I'll tell you how.
— to a little kike like Wolfsheim?

1292
01:40:43,338 --> 01:40:45,750
— It's called greed, old sport.
— That's right.

1293
01:40:45,765 --> 01:40:49,417
And you have half of Wall Street
out there swilling your free booze,

1294
01:40:49,435 --> 01:40:51,199
at that fun park every weekend.

1295
01:40:51,301 --> 01:40:53,985
I'm surprised he hasn't
tried to drag you in.

1296
01:40:55,642 --> 01:40:57,366
My God, he has.

1297
01:40:57,438 --> 01:41:01,279
— He's got nothing to do with—
— with your odd little racket.

1298
01:41:02,454 --> 01:41:04,345
Daisy?
Daisy!

1299
01:41:06,009 --> 01:41:08,280
Can't you see who this guy is?

1300
01:41:08,396 --> 01:41:13,186
With his house. And his parties.
And his fancy clothes.

1301
01:41:14,001 --> 01:41:17,905
He's just a front for Wolfsheim,
a gangster,

1302
01:41:18,074 --> 01:41:20,800
to get his claws into respectable
folks like Walter Chase.

1303
01:41:20,861 --> 01:41:23,862
The only respectable thing about you,
old sport, is your money.

1304
01:41:24,336 --> 01:41:25,414
Your money, that's it.

1305
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:27,831
I have just as much as you,
that means we're equal.

1306
01:41:27,855 --> 01:41:29,599
Oh, no! No.

1307
01:41:30,519 --> 01:41:36,263
We're different.
I am, they are, she is.

1308
01:41:36,597 --> 01:41:38,800
We're all different from you.

1309
01:41:38,847 --> 01:41:41,213
You see, we were born different.

1310
01:41:43,320 --> 01:41:44,968
It's in our blood.

1311
01:41:44,991 --> 01:41:49,078
And nothing that
you could do, say, or steal,

1312
01:41:49,323 --> 01:41:52,245
or dream up, can ever change that.

1313
01:41:52,406 --> 01:41:53,804
A girl like Daisy—

1314
01:41:53,850 --> 01:41:59,946
You shut up! Shut up!

1315
01:42:08,404 --> 01:42:15,014
<i>Gatsby looked in that moment
as if he had killed a man.</i>

1316
01:42:28,895 --> 01:42:32,982
My… My sincerest…

1317
01:42:33,059 --> 01:42:36,878
My sincerest apologies.

1318
01:42:39,456 --> 01:42:43,056
I seem to… have lost my temper.

1319
01:42:43,661 --> 01:42:46,067
That's right, Mr. Gatsby.

1320
01:42:46,813 --> 01:42:49,372
You showed us some of those
fine Oxford manners.

1321
01:42:49,392 --> 01:42:51,477
Daisy, darling.

1322
01:42:51,512 --> 01:42:54,966
None of this has… any consequence, I—

1323
01:42:55,555 --> 01:42:59,713
Daisy.
Daisy, talk to me, darling.

1324
01:42:59,851 --> 01:43:02,131
I just lost my temper, that's all.

1325
01:43:02,246 --> 01:43:04,958
<i>He began talking excitedly.</i>

1326
01:43:05,082 --> 01:43:09,249
<i>But with every word, Daisy was drawing
further and further into herself.</i>

1327
01:43:09,274 --> 01:43:11,141
…to go to your parents' house
in Louisville.

1328
01:43:11,142 --> 01:43:13,800
Please, Tom,
I can't stand it anymore!

1329
01:43:16,810 --> 01:43:21,785
Why don't you two start on home,
in Mr. Gatsby's car.

1330
01:43:21,810 --> 01:43:23,348
— Daisy, darling, look at me.
— Go on.

1331
01:43:23,374 --> 01:43:25,957
— Daisy.
— He won't annoy you.

1332
01:43:26,385 --> 01:43:29,557
I think he realizes that this
little flirtation is over.

1333
01:43:29,598 --> 01:43:31,647
Daisy? Daisy!

1334
01:43:45,306 --> 01:43:50,317
Do you want any of this?
Jordan? Nick?

1335
01:43:52,617 --> 01:43:56,289
— Nick?
— What?

1336
01:43:56,353 --> 01:43:59,056
— You want any?
— No.

1337
01:44:00,553 --> 01:44:02,446
I just remembered…

1338
01:44:04,370 --> 01:44:06,722
today is my birthday.

1339
01:44:10,330 --> 01:44:12,310
Happy birthday.

1340
01:44:14,527 --> 01:44:18,660
<i>Thirty. The promise
of a decade of loneliness.</i>

1341
01:44:18,957 --> 01:44:22,381
<i>The formidable stroke
of thirty died away…</i>

1342
01:44:22,496 --> 01:44:26,821
<i>as Gatsby and Daisy drove on
through the cooling twilight…</i>

1343
01:44:28,651 --> 01:44:31,023
<i>towards death.</i>

1344
01:44:34,304 --> 01:44:37,556
Don't you lie to me!
Where did you get this from?

1345
01:44:37,583 --> 01:44:40,179
You might fool me, but you don't fool God!

1346
01:44:40,338 --> 01:44:42,574
God sees everything!

1347
01:44:44,467 --> 01:44:47,819
Myrtle! Where are you?

1348
01:44:54,912 --> 01:44:57,588
Stop! Stop!

1349
01:44:57,589 --> 01:45:01,959
— Myrtle! Baby!
— Stop!

1350
01:45:03,796 --> 01:45:06,216
Please!

1351
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:43,117
Slow down! Slow down!
Bad trouble up ahead, sir!

1352
01:45:43,325 --> 01:45:47,382
Good! Wilson will have
a little business at last.

1353
01:45:47,383 --> 01:45:49,431
Let's take a look.
— Oh, must we?

1354
01:45:49,836 --> 01:45:51,449
Just a look.

1355
01:45:51,924 --> 01:45:53,266
Come on!

1356
01:45:58,823 --> 01:46:01,000
Move back! Clear the space here!

1357
01:46:02,125 --> 01:46:04,125
Have a little respect!

1358
01:46:04,150 --> 01:46:08,150
If you don't have a legitimate reason to
be in the building, I want you outside!

1359
01:46:15,249 --> 01:46:18,531
If you saw anything tonight
you'd like to talk to me about,

1360
01:46:18,557 --> 01:46:21,209
well, then you can talk to me outside.

1361
01:46:21,234 --> 01:46:23,234
I don't want you in here. Okay?

1362
01:46:25,232 --> 01:46:27,869
Please. Stand back. Please.

1363
01:46:27,894 --> 01:46:29,894
Oh God.

1364
01:46:30,919 --> 01:46:34,619
All right, folks. Make some room, huh?
Make some room back there!

1365
01:46:35,344 --> 01:46:37,344
If you have no business, clear out!

1366
01:46:53,259 --> 01:46:53,774
Sir?

1367
01:46:53,800 --> 01:46:55,332
What are you doing? Sir!

1368
01:46:55,333 --> 01:46:58,269
Sir, I'm asking you to—
— Get off me!

1369
01:46:58,477 --> 01:47:00,246
I'm fine!

1370
01:47:01,451 --> 01:47:03,633
I'm fine.

1371
01:47:04,996 --> 01:47:07,232
You knew her, eh?

1372
01:47:12,943 --> 01:47:15,194
Not really. No.

1373
01:47:16,863 --> 01:47:19,263
I gotta ask you to step back, sir.

1374
01:47:22,583 --> 01:47:24,208
So what happened?

1375
01:47:24,575 --> 01:47:26,891
She ran out in the road.

1376
01:47:27,277 --> 01:47:30,315
Sonofabitch didn't even stop his car.

1377
01:47:30,356 --> 01:47:34,083
Hey! I saw it. It was a yellow car.
A big yellow car.

1378
01:47:34,246 --> 01:47:35,677
The damn thing came out of nowhere.

1379
01:47:35,694 --> 01:47:39,507
Yeah. Yeah, big yellow Duesy.
Custom job.

1380
01:47:40,612 --> 01:47:43,581
You have to tell me what
kind of car it was.

1381
01:47:43,742 --> 01:47:45,467
I know what kind of car it was.

1382
01:47:47,162 --> 01:47:50,727
— Wilson. Wilson, pull yourself together!
— I know what kind of car it was!

1383
01:47:50,752 --> 01:47:51,788
He's upset!
Everybody out!

1384
01:47:51,789 --> 01:47:54,682
Can't you see the man
needs peace and quiet! Listen!

1385
01:47:54,763 --> 01:47:56,882
Wilson! I just—
I just got here from New York.

1386
01:47:57,797 --> 01:48:01,030
Enough! Hey, Wilson!
I was bringing you the coupé.

1387
01:48:01,153 --> 01:48:02,784
Sit down, sit down!

1388
01:48:03,431 --> 01:48:04,883
Give him a drink!
Give him a drink!

1389
01:48:04,949 --> 01:48:07,361
That yellow car wasn't mine.
D'you hear?

1390
01:48:07,438 --> 01:48:09,236
I haven't seen it all afternoon.

1391
01:48:09,303 --> 01:48:11,289
Hey!

1392
01:48:11,329 --> 01:48:13,215
What color is your car?

1393
01:48:13,323 --> 01:48:15,777
It's blue.
Coupé.

1394
01:48:15,893 --> 01:48:17,292
We just got here from New York.

1395
01:48:17,361 --> 01:48:18,867
Yeah, they just stopped.

1396
01:48:26,261 --> 01:48:28,159
Okay.

1397
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:30,757
Blue.

1398
01:48:33,660 --> 01:48:35,704
Here.

1399
01:48:36,729 --> 01:48:37,979
Leave us alone.

1400
01:48:39,005 --> 01:48:39,754
Wilson.

1401
01:48:45,247 --> 01:48:48,004
Who owns the yellow car?

1402
01:48:50,879 --> 01:48:54,142
A fella named Gatsby.
Jay Gatsby.

1403
01:48:55,957 --> 01:48:58,218
He's a crook, George. Yes…

1404
01:48:58,801 --> 01:49:02,674
throws all those parties the papers
are always talking about.

1405
01:49:08,037 --> 01:49:11,995
Maybe he was the one that was
fooling around with Myrtle.

1406
01:49:12,344 --> 01:49:14,755
Maybe that's why he killed her!

1407
01:49:14,812 --> 01:49:16,344
Yeah, maybe.

1408
01:49:18,731 --> 01:49:21,481
A guy like that, who knows?

1409
01:49:24,221 --> 01:49:27,578
He didn't have to kill her.

1410
01:49:35,977 --> 01:49:37,422
Gatsby.

1411
01:49:38,537 --> 01:49:42,449
Something ought to be done
about a fella like that.

1412
01:49:44,849 --> 01:49:48,262
He'll pay.
Oh, he will pay.

1413
01:49:55,416 --> 01:49:57,338
Coward!

1414
01:49:58,371 --> 01:50:00,499
He didn't even stop his car.

1415
01:50:02,638 --> 01:50:05,029
You're gonna defend him now?

1416
01:50:24,370 --> 01:50:26,261
I'll telephone for a taxi, Nick.

1417
01:50:26,311 --> 01:50:29,063
Why don't you come inside
and have some supper while you wait?

1418
01:50:29,198 --> 01:50:31,998
No thanks. I'll wait outside.

1419
01:50:33,493 --> 01:50:35,869
What is the matter with you?

1420
01:50:40,466 --> 01:50:43,044
— Won't you come in, Nick.
— No Thanks .

1421
01:50:43,058 --> 01:50:46,841
— It's only half past nine.
— No, I've had enough! Of everyone.

1422
01:51:02,775 --> 01:51:05,120
Hello, old sport.

1423
01:51:13,209 --> 01:51:15,335
What are you doing?

1424
01:51:16,318 --> 01:51:19,474
— Just sitting here.
— Yes, I see that!

1425
01:51:19,701 --> 01:51:21,560
Did you see any trouble out on the road?

1426
01:51:21,610 --> 01:51:23,681
That woman you ran down is dead, Jay!

1427
01:51:23,996 --> 01:51:26,945
I thought so, I…
I told Daisy that I thought so.

1428
01:51:26,992 --> 01:51:28,316
It's better that the shock—
— Daisy?

1429
01:51:28,329 --> 01:51:30,037
— …should all come at once.
— Do you hear yourself?

1430
01:51:30,061 --> 01:51:31,726
How could you?
How could you do that?

1431
01:51:31,772 --> 01:51:32,896
— Keep your voice down!
— What's wrong with you?

1432
01:51:32,922 --> 01:51:34,838
You're nothing but a goddamn coward!

1433
01:51:34,874 --> 01:51:38,494
Keep your voice down, please!
There was no point in stop—

1434
01:51:38,536 --> 01:51:41,642
No point ? No point!
What about that woman?

1435
01:51:41,700 --> 01:51:44,253
No point. She was— she was—
she was killed instantly.

1436
01:51:44,346 --> 01:51:47,011
Yes, it ripped her open!
I was there, I saw it!

1437
01:51:47,040 --> 01:51:50,353
I understand! I understand you.
It was my fault!

1438
01:51:50,478 --> 01:51:53,597
It was my fault, this woman,
she rushed out at us as if she was—

1439
01:51:53,598 --> 01:51:55,752
See, she was trying to speak to us,

1440
01:51:55,759 --> 01:51:58,383
it all happened so quickly!
She tried—

1441
01:51:58,923 --> 01:52:01,436
I tried to turn in time, but—
— She?

1442
01:52:18,365 --> 01:52:20,522
That was Daisy?!

1443
01:52:24,918 --> 01:52:27,477
No, I…

1444
01:52:29,172 --> 01:52:32,494
You see, after we left
New York, she was…

1445
01:52:32,548 --> 01:52:34,785
she was very nervous, she thought…

1446
01:52:35,602 --> 01:52:37,967
that driving would steady her.

1447
01:52:38,001 --> 01:52:42,088
But… this woman, she rushed out at us.

1448
01:52:44,387 --> 01:52:46,906
It all happened so quickly.

1449
01:52:46,969 --> 01:52:49,131
It wasn't her fault, d'you see?

1450
01:53:11,119 --> 01:53:13,953
No one must know that Daisy was driving.

1451
01:53:15,599 --> 01:53:17,728
Promise me.

1452
01:53:18,042 --> 01:53:19,395
Jay.

1453
01:53:19,581 --> 01:53:21,714
You should go home
and get some rest.

1454
01:53:21,782 --> 01:53:23,267
I'm going to wait here.

1455
01:53:23,367 --> 01:53:25,499
I'm gonna wait here
all night, if necessary.

1456
01:53:25,512 --> 01:53:27,081
No, no, no. That's not a good idea.

1457
01:53:27,098 --> 01:53:30,392
If he tries to bother her about
that unpleasantness this afternoon,

1458
01:53:30,414 --> 01:53:31,832
if he tries to bother her,

1459
01:53:31,851 --> 01:53:33,456
if he tries any brutality—
— Wait!

1460
01:53:33,472 --> 01:53:35,818
— on her, whatsoever,
— Tom— Tom won't touch her,

1461
01:53:35,846 --> 01:53:38,825
— He's not even thinking about her, Jay.
— I don't trust him.

1462
01:53:38,873 --> 01:53:43,480
I don't trust him.
— Alright. Alright.

1463
01:53:46,213 --> 01:53:48,011
You wait here.

1464
01:53:49,163 --> 01:53:51,511
I'll see if there's any commotion.

1465
01:53:52,369 --> 01:53:55,019
Would you?

1466
01:53:57,993 --> 01:53:59,866
Thank you, old sport.

1467
01:54:08,837 --> 01:54:11,037
Listen, she was in the wrong,
running out on the road.

1468
01:54:11,063 --> 01:54:12,886
Sweetheart, you have
nothing to worry about.

1469
01:54:12,933 --> 01:54:17,454
Let me take care of things.
Take care of you.

1470
01:54:17,479 --> 01:54:19,479
I'll make some calls.
We'll go away.

1471
01:54:20,855 --> 01:54:24,018
Just go away, get out of town.

1472
01:54:24,019 --> 01:54:27,647
Get some rest. Don't worry.
It'll be alright.

1473
01:55:01,524 --> 01:55:04,277
— Hello, old sport.
— Jay.

1474
01:55:04,920 --> 01:55:08,575
— Is everything alright?
— Yes. Everything's just fine.

1475
01:55:09,652 --> 01:55:12,896
At four o'clock, she—
she came at the window.

1476
01:55:13,739 --> 01:55:15,113
She stood there, then…

1477
01:55:16,469 --> 01:55:19,074
she turned out the lights, so…

1478
01:55:19,099 --> 01:55:21,101
Well…

1479
01:55:21,932 --> 01:55:24,432
Give me a hand, will you, old sport?

1480
01:55:24,685 --> 01:55:27,982
<i>I should have told him
what I had just seen, but…</i>

1481
01:55:29,058 --> 01:55:31,511
<i>All I could manage was:</i>

1482
01:55:31,877 --> 01:55:35,417
You know Jay, with everything that's
happened, you ought to go away.

1483
01:55:35,524 --> 01:55:37,676
Tonight. They'll trace your car.

1484
01:55:37,698 --> 01:55:40,448
Go away? No. I can't leave now.
Not tonight.

1485
01:55:40,571 --> 01:55:42,664
Jay, do you understand that
a woman has been killed?

1486
01:55:42,718 --> 01:55:44,782
Daisy's gonna call in the morning.

1487
01:55:45,191 --> 01:55:48,519
Then we'll make plans,
to go away together.

1488
01:55:50,099 --> 01:55:51,203
Uh, Daisy, she—

1489
01:55:51,216 --> 01:55:53,053
She just needs time
to think things through.

1490
01:55:53,054 --> 01:55:56,751
Herzog! We're talking. Thank you.

1491
01:55:59,874 --> 01:56:04,582
She just needs time to think—
— No, Jay… Daisy—

1492
01:56:04,637 --> 01:56:08,886
She just needs time to think,
she's going to call in the morning.

1493
01:56:17,765 --> 01:56:20,048
Wait up with me.

1494
01:56:23,986 --> 01:56:26,521
The sun's almost up.

1495
01:56:29,444 --> 01:56:33,119
<i>That was the night he
finally told me the truth.</i>

1496
01:56:33,328 --> 01:56:34,245
<i>All of it.</i>

1497
01:56:37,300 --> 01:56:41,529
You know, I thought for a while
I had a lot of things, but…

1498
01:56:42,091 --> 01:56:45,124
the truth is I'm…
I'm empty.

1499
01:56:45,153 --> 01:56:48,119
I suppose that's why I make
things up about myself,

1500
01:56:48,135 --> 01:56:51,855
but I wanted to tell you the whole
story for a very long time.

1501
01:56:53,476 --> 01:56:56,655
You see, I grew up terribly,
terribly poor, old sport.

1502
01:56:56,963 --> 01:56:59,902
My folks were…
<i>— He revealed his humble beginnings,</i>

1503
01:57:00,010 --> 01:57:03,415
<i>his transformative voyage with Dan Cody.</i>

1504
01:57:03,496 --> 01:57:09,265
<i>The war, Oxford, and how
he joined Wolfsheim in the business.</i>

1505
01:57:11,035 --> 01:57:17,279
<i>That was also that night that I became aware
of Gatsby's extraordinary gift for hope.</i>

1506
01:57:17,312 --> 01:57:18,840
I can't describe how surprised I was

1507
01:57:18,841 --> 01:57:21,512
to find out that I loved her, old sport,
and that she loved me too.

1508
01:57:21,586 --> 01:57:24,786
<i>A gift that I have never found
in any other person…</i>

1509
01:57:24,835 --> 01:57:29,148
I never realized how extraordinary
a nice girl could be.

1510
01:57:29,338 --> 01:57:32,766
<i>…and which it is not likely
I shall ever find again.</i>

1511
01:57:32,967 --> 01:57:36,658
I thought out my life with Daisy in it,
trying to figure out how we could marry,

1512
01:57:36,686 --> 01:57:39,242
and struggle along on
so many dollars a month.

1513
01:57:40,676 --> 01:57:42,954
What was in the letter?

1514
01:57:44,882 --> 01:57:48,911
The reason why after the war, I…
I hadn't been able to return.

1515
01:57:50,201 --> 01:57:55,570
I asked her to wait until I made
something of myself. But she was…

1516
01:57:56,132 --> 01:57:58,574
See, I felt married to her.

1517
01:58:01,408 --> 01:58:03,001
That was all.

1518
01:58:03,696 --> 01:58:09,432
<i>It was all for her. The house,
the parties. Everything.</i>

1519
01:58:16,666 --> 01:58:18,702
God sees everything.

1520
01:58:27,471 --> 01:58:30,037
Mr. Gatsby, sir, excuse me.

1521
01:58:30,038 --> 01:58:32,508
— Chicago called, it's—
— Not now.

1522
01:58:33,588 --> 01:58:39,034
— Keep it open for a personal call.
— A personal call? Of course.

1523
01:58:39,171 --> 01:58:41,987
Excuse me sir, Mr. Gatsby,
I'm gonna drain the pool today,

1524
01:58:41,994 --> 01:58:43,769
before the leaves start falling in.

1525
01:58:43,789 --> 01:58:45,323
Not today.

1526
01:58:47,769 --> 01:58:50,136
Not today. It's so beautiful.

1527
01:58:50,805 --> 01:58:52,261
You know, old sport…

1528
01:58:53,368 --> 01:58:55,654
I haven't used that pool once all summer.

1529
01:58:55,684 --> 01:58:59,561
Let's take a swim.
Have the phone brought down to the pool.

1530
01:59:13,645 --> 01:59:16,055
I have to go, Jay.

1531
01:59:18,121 --> 01:59:21,252
I have to work.
— I understand.

1532
01:59:23,054 --> 01:59:25,496
Well. I'll walk you out.

1533
01:59:33,754 --> 01:59:39,440
— Well, I'll call you up.
— Please do, old sport. Please do.

1534
01:59:42,321 --> 01:59:45,120
I suppose that Daisy will call too.

1535
01:59:48,385 --> 01:59:53,044
I… Well I suppose.

1536
01:59:53,045 --> 01:59:54,204
Yes.

1537
01:59:56,564 --> 01:59:58,747
Well. Goodbye.

1538
02:00:17,746 --> 02:00:19,977
Jay?

1539
02:00:20,947 --> 02:00:23,407
They're a rotten crowd.

1540
02:00:24,096 --> 02:00:27,412
You're worth the whole
damn bunch put together.

1541
02:00:37,413 --> 02:00:40,148
<i>I was always glad I said that.</i>

1542
02:00:42,025 --> 02:00:45,397
<i>It was the only compliment
I ever paid him.</i>

1543
02:00:48,820 --> 02:00:54,194
<i>That morning, Wall Street
boomed its usual golden roar.</i>

1544
02:00:54,266 --> 02:00:57,677
<i>But I wasn't worth
a decent stroke of work.</i>

1545
02:00:58,693 --> 02:01:01,871
<i>And I waited for Gatsby
to call with news…</i>

1546
02:01:04,163 --> 02:01:06,957
<i>while he waited for Daisy.</i>

1547
02:01:50,114 --> 02:01:52,369
Gatsby's?

1548
02:01:52,865 --> 02:01:57,030
I know Mr. Gatsby will be
very happy that you've called.

1549
02:02:18,392 --> 02:02:21,100
Daisy…

1550
02:02:41,440 --> 02:02:46,656
Hello ? Hello?
Hello, is everything all right?

1551
02:02:52,366 --> 02:02:55,027
Hello? Hello?

1552
02:03:08,931 --> 02:03:13,999
<i>I remember the rest of that day
as an endless drill of police</i>

1553
02:03:14,031 --> 02:03:17,002
<i>and photographers and tabloid reporters.</i>

1554
02:03:18,605 --> 02:03:21,417
<i>The headlines were a nightmare.</i>

1555
02:03:21,969 --> 02:03:24,280
<i>They pinned everything on Gatsby.</i>

1556
02:03:24,332 --> 02:03:28,693
<i>The affair with Myrtle,
the hit and run, everything.</i>

1557
02:03:28,757 --> 02:03:31,091
<i>And there was nothing I could say,</i>

1558
02:03:31,153 --> 02:03:36,167
<i>except the one unutterable fact
that none of it was true.</i>

1559
02:03:36,262 --> 02:03:39,969
Darling, Daddy's taking care
of his two favorite girls.

1560
02:03:40,011 --> 02:03:42,987
— Where are we going?
— We're going on a holiday.

1561
02:03:43,036 --> 02:03:45,705
— We should go.
— Just you, me and Daddy.

1562
02:03:49,334 --> 02:03:50,679
Buchanan residence.

1563
02:03:50,740 --> 02:03:54,540
May I speak to Mrs. Buchanan?
It's Mr. Carraway, her cousin.

1564
02:03:54,563 --> 02:03:57,007
Madame is not available,
Monsieur Carraway.

1565
02:03:57,379 --> 02:04:00,188
If you speak to her, tell her
the funeral's tomorrow.

1566
02:04:00,270 --> 02:04:02,763
I'm sorry, Monsieur.
They have gone away.

1567
02:04:02,798 --> 02:04:05,115
Gone away! Do you know
when they'll be back?

1568
02:04:08,503 --> 02:04:11,862
No. They have already departed.

1569
02:04:14,968 --> 02:04:19,613
Please. I know that she would
want to be there, she would—

1570
02:04:19,614 --> 02:04:22,707
If you'd just get a message to her,
let me talk to her, please.

1571
02:04:22,721 --> 02:04:27,601
You wish to contact her…
I have no further information, Monsieur.

1572
02:04:27,790 --> 02:04:29,828
— Please!
— Αu revoir.

1573
02:04:29,840 --> 02:04:32,858
I…
Hello?

1574
02:04:41,608 --> 02:04:48,383
<i>They were careless people, Tom and Daisy.
They smashed up things and people,</i>

1575
02:04:48,406 --> 02:04:52,860
<i>and then retreated back into their
money and their vast carelessness.</i>

1576
02:04:54,764 --> 02:04:58,064
Hey! Hey!
Get out of here!

1577
02:04:58,084 --> 02:05:02,151
Go on! Get the hell out of here!

1578
02:05:14,667 --> 02:05:19,114
<i>I rang, I wrote, I implored.</i>

1579
02:05:20,577 --> 02:05:26,179
<i>But not a single one of the sparkling
hundreds that enjoyed his hospitality,</i>

1580
02:05:26,387 --> 02:05:30,993
<i>attended the funeral.
And from Daisy…</i>

1581
02:05:32,053 --> 02:05:34,442
<i>not even a flower.</i>

1582
02:05:35,789 --> 02:05:40,902
<i>I was all he had.
The only one who cared.</i>

1583
02:06:12,222 --> 02:06:17,177
<i>After Gatsby's death,
New York was haunted for me.</i>

1584
02:06:18,848 --> 02:06:20,804
<i>That city…</i>

1585
02:06:22,131 --> 02:06:26,056
<i>my once golden shimmering mirage…</i>

1586
02:06:27,512 --> 02:06:30,373
<i>now made me sick.</i>

1587
02:06:33,250 --> 02:06:35,955
<i>On my last night in New York,</i>

1588
02:06:36,728 --> 02:06:41,760
<i>I returned to that huge
incoherent house once more.</i>

1589
02:06:41,894 --> 02:06:45,294
<i>Wolfsheim Associates had cleaned it out.</i>

1590
02:06:45,335 --> 02:06:48,571
He threw all those parties,
hoping she would wander in one night.

1591
02:06:48,599 --> 02:06:50,300
It's like an amusement park!

1592
02:06:50,328 --> 02:06:51,966
How do you live here all alone?

1593
02:06:52,014 --> 02:06:55,283
She makes it look so— so splendid,
don't you think, old sport?

1594
02:06:55,857 --> 02:06:59,897
Music! And then we can dance all night.

1595
02:07:01,524 --> 02:07:03,745
Will you come, old sport?
We need you.

1596
02:07:03,792 --> 02:07:05,955
I wish it could always be like this.

1597
02:07:06,584 --> 02:07:08,779
It will be.

1598
02:07:09,857 --> 02:07:15,928
<i>I remembered how we had all come to
Gatsby's and guessed at his corruption,</i>

1599
02:07:16,489 --> 02:07:22,164
<i>while he stood before us,
concealing an incorruptible dream.</i>

1600
02:07:22,893 --> 02:07:27,555
It's perfect. From your perfect
irresistible imagination.

1601
02:07:33,906 --> 02:07:36,650
<i>The moon rose higher.</i>

1602
02:07:37,343 --> 02:07:41,551
<i>And as I stood there,
brooding on an old unknown world,</i>

1603
02:07:41,913 --> 02:07:45,743
<i>I thought of Gatsby's wonder when
he first picked out the green light</i>

1604
02:07:45,764 --> 02:07:48,269
<i>at the end of Daisy's dock.</i>

1605
02:07:53,312 --> 02:07:56,467
<i>He had come such a long way,</i>

1606
02:07:56,529 --> 02:08:02,352
<i>and his dream must have seemed so close
that he could hardly fail to grasp it…</i>

1607
02:08:06,384 --> 02:08:09,950
<i>But he did not know that
it was already behind him.</i>

1608
02:08:11,546 --> 02:08:14,637
<i>Gatsby believed in the green light,</i>

1609
02:08:14,851 --> 02:08:19,380
<i>the orgastic future that year
by year recedes before us.</i>

1610
02:08:19,702 --> 02:08:22,589
<i>It eluded us then,
but that's no matter.</i>

1611
02:08:22,724 --> 02:08:28,035
<i>Tomorrow we will run faster,
stretch out our arms farther…</i>

1612
02:08:28,809 --> 02:08:33,330
<i>And one fine morning—
So we beat on,</i>

1613
02:08:33,882 --> 02:08:40,284
<i>boats against the current,
borne back ceaselessly</i>

1614
02:08:40,979 --> 02:08:44,341
<i>into the past.</i>

1615
02:09:37,581 --> 02:09:41,585
