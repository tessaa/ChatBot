1
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,639
<i>Born of cold and winter air</i>

2
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,999
<i>And mountain rain combining</i>

3
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,159
<i>This icy force both foul and fair</i>

4
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,679
<i>Has a frozen heart worth mining</i>

5
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,559
<i>So cut through the heart</i>

6
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,039
<i>Cold and clear</i>

7
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,159
<i>Strike for love and strike for fear</i>

8
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,091
<i>See the beauty sharp and sheer</i>

9
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,039
<i>Split the ice apart</i>

10
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,040
<i>And break the frozen heart
Hup, ho</i>

11
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,488
<i>Watch your step
Let it go</i>

12
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,968
<i>Hup, ho</i>

13
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,761
<i>Watch your step
Let it go</i>

14
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,999
<i>Beautiful
Powerful</i>

15
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,359
<i>Dangerous
Cold</i>

16
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,679
<i>Ice has a magic
Can't be controlled</i>

17
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,919
<i>Stronger than one</i>

18
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,281
<i>Stronger than ten</i>

19
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,039
<i>Stronger than a hundred men!</i>

20
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,399
Oh!

21
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,839
<i>Born of cold
And winter air</i>

22
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,159
<i>And mountain rain combining</i>

23
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,559
<i>This icy force both foul and fair</i>

24
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,445
<i>Has a frozen heart worth mining</i>

25
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,719
<i>Cut through the heart</i>

26
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,919
<i>Cold and clear</i>

27
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,282
<i>Strike for love and strike for fear</i>

28
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,802
<i>There's beauty and there's danger here</i>

29
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,122
<i>Split the ice apart</i>

30
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:09,410
<i>Beware the frozen heart</i>

31
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,127
Come on, Sven.

32
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,685
Elsa. Psst!

33
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,565
Elsa!

34
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,888
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up!

35
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,521
Anna, go back to sleep.

36
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,008
I just can't.

37
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,125
The sky is awake, so I'm awake.

38
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,279
So, we have to play.

39
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,239
Go play by yourself.

40
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,448
Do you want to build a snowman?

41
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,039
Come on, come on, come on!

42
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,049
Do the magic!
Do the magic!

43
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,686
Oh...

44
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,129
- Ready?
- Uh-huh.

45
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,329
This is amazing!

46
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,411
Watch this!

47
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,839
Hi, I'm Olaf, and
I like warm hugs.

48
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,644
I love you, Olaf!

49
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,084
Olaf...

50
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,601
Tickle bumps!

51
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,046
Oh!

52
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,761
Hang on!

53
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,039
Catch me!

54
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,079
Gotcha!

55
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,486
Again!

56
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,801
Wait!

57
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,687
- Whoo-hoo!
- Slow down!

58
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,839
Whoo!

59
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,246
Anna!

60
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,726
Anna!

61
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,243
Mama! Papa!

62
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,404
No, no...

63
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,399
You're okay, Anna. I got you.

64
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,046
Elsa, what have you done?

65
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,130
This is getting out of hand.

66
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,599
It was an accident.
I'm sorry, Anna!

67
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,565
- Oh. She's ice cold.
- I know where we have to go.

68
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,646
Ice?

69
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,119
Faster, Sven.

70
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,321
Sven!

71
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,282
Please! Help! It's my daughter.

72
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,679
It's the king.

73
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,439
- Trolls?
- Shush!

74
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,005
I'm trying to listen.

75
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,171
Cuties. I'm going to keep you.

76
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,645
Your Majesty.

77
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,679
Born with the powers, or cursed?

78
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,201
Born.
And they're getting stronger.

79
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,731
Here, here.

80
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,564
You are lucky it wasn't her heart.

81
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,930
The heart is not so easily changed.

82
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,726
But the head can be persuaded.

83
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,610
Do what you must.

84
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,286
I recommend we remove all magic.

85
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,042
Even memories of magic,
to be safe.

86
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,009
But don't worry.
I'll leave the fun.

87
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,411
She will be okay.

88
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,088
But she won't
remember I have powers?

89
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,959
It's for the best.

90
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:34,484
Listen to me, Elsa.
Your power will only grow.

91
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,039
There is beauty in it...

92
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,359
But also great danger.

93
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,881
You must learn to control it.

94
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,763
Fear will be your enemy.

95
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,761
No!

96
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,319
We'll protect her.

97
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,599
She can learn to control it.
I'm sure.

98
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,159
<i>Until then...</i>

99
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,044
<i>We'll lock the gates.</i>

100
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,599
<i>We'll reduce the staff.</i>

101
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,087
<i>We will limit her contact with people,</i>

102
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,244
<i>and keep her powers
hidden from everyone.</i>

103
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,370
<i>Including Anna.</i>

104
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,724
Ah.

105
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,566
Elsa?

106
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,045
<i>Do you wanna build a snowman?</i>

107
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,847
<i>Come on, let's go and play</i>

108
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,803
<i>I never see you anymore</i>

109
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,246
<i>Come out the door</i>

110
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,006
<i>It's like you've gone away</i>

111
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:42,121
<i>We used to be best buddies
And now we're not</i>

112
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,201
<i>I wish you would tell me why</i>

113
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,166
<i>Do you wanna build a snowman?</i>

114
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,959
<i>It doesn't have to be a snowman</i>

115
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,719
Go away, Anna.

116
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,730
<i>Okay, bye</i>

117
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,091
The gloves will help.

118
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,479
See? Conceal it.

119
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,119
Don't feel it.

120
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,924
Don't let it show.

121
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,639
<i>Do you wanna build a snowman?</i>

122
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,959
<i>Or ride our bike around the halls?</i>

123
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,159
<i>I think some company is overdue</i>

124
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,199
<i>I've started talking
To the pictures on the walls</i>

125
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,279
Hang in there, Joan.

126
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,962
<i>It gets a little lonely
All these empty rooms</i>

127
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,891
<i>Just watching the hours tick by</i>

128
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,159
I'm scared.

129
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,239
It's getting stronger!

130
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,079
Getting upset only makes it worse.
Calm down.

131
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,879
No! Don't touch me!

132
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,208
Please, I don't want to hurt you.

133
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,884
See you in two weeks!

134
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,161
Do you have to go?

135
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,569
You'll be fine, Elsa.

136
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,525
Your Highness.

137
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,841
Elsa?

138
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,087
<i>Please
I know you're in there</i>

139
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,647
<i>People are asking where you've been</i>

140
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,529
<i>They say "Have courage"
And I'm trying to</i>

141
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,799
<i>I'm right out here for you</i>

142
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,207
<i>Just let me in</i>

143
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,250
<i>We only have each other
It's just you and me</i>

144
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,771
<i>What are we gonna do?</i>

145
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,440
<i>Do you wanna build a snowman?</i>

146
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,279
All ashore!

147
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,599
Welcome to Arendelle!

148
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,239
Watch your step, please.

149
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,999
The gates will be opening soon.

150
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,919
Why do I have to wear this?

151
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,159
Because the queen has come of age.

152
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,999
It's Coronation Day!

153
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,009
That's not my fault.

154
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,319
What do you want, Sven?

155
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,639
"Give me a snack."

156
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,319
What's the magic word?

157
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,399
"Please."

158
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,489
Uh! Uh-uh-uh. Share.

159
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,039
I can't believe they're
finally opening up the gates!

160
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,881
- And for a whole day!
- Faster, Percy!

161
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:32,207
Arendelle, our most
mysterious trade partner.

162
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:37,041
Open those gates so I may unlock your
secrets and exploit your riches.

163
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,926
Did I say that out loud?

164
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,519
Oh! Me sore eyes can't wait to
see the queen and the princess.

165
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,679
I bet they are absolutely lovely.

166
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,882
I bet they are beautiful.

167
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,519
Princess Anna?

168
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,802
- Princess Anna?
- Huh? Yeah?

169
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,879
Oh. Sorry to wake you, ma'am.

170
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,719
No, no, no, you didn't.

171
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,490
I've been up for hours.

172
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,166
Who is it?

173
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,879
Still me, ma'am.

174
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,759
The gates will open soon.
Time to get ready.

175
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,839
Of course.

176
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,079
Ready for what?

177
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,639
Your sister's coronation, ma'am.

178
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,161
My sister's corneration.

179
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,919
It's Coronation Day!

180
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,163
It's Coronation Day!

181
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,399
<i>The window is open!</i>

182
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,559
<i>So's that door!</i>

183
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,879
<i>I didn't know they did that anymore</i>

184
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,130
<i>Who knew we owned
8,000 salad plates?</i>

185
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,962
<i>For years I've roamed these empty halls</i>

186
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,562
<i>Why have a ballroom with no balls?</i>

187
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,965
<i>Finally
They're opening up the gates!</i>

188
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,799
<i>There'll be actual,
real, live people</i>

189
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,799
<i>It'll be totally strange</i>

190
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:58,050
<i>But wow!
Am I so ready for this change!</i>

191
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,649
<i>'Cause for the first time in forever</i>

192
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,439
<i>There'll be music</i>

193
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,359
<i>There'll be light</i>

194
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,599
<i>For the first time</i>

195
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,802
<i>In forever</i>

196
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:16,848
<i>I'll be dancing through the night</i>

197
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,999
<i>Don't know if I'm elated or gassy</i>

198
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,965
<i>But I'm somewhere in that zone</i>

199
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,002
<i>'Cause for the first time in forever</i>

200
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,799
<i>I won't be alone</i>

201
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,810
I can't wait to meet everyone!

202
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,239
What if I meet The One?

203
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,319
<i>Tonight
Imagine me gown and all</i>

204
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,639
<i>Fetchingly draped against the wall</i>

205
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:46,164
<i>The picture of sophisticated grace</i>

206
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,639
<i>I suddenly see him standing there</i>

207
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,879
<i>A beautiful stranger</i>

208
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,959
<i>Tall and fair</i>

209
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:55,639
<i>I wanna stuff some
chocolate in my face!</i>

210
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,359
<i>But then we laugh and talk all evening</i>

211
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,639
<i>Which is totally bizarre</i>

212
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,845
<i>Nothing like the life
I've led so far</i>

213
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,205
<i>For the first time in forever</i>

214
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:13,883
<i>There'll be magic
There'll be fun</i>

215
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,364
<i>For the first time in forever</i>

216
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:23,083
<i>I could be noticed by someone</i>

217
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,767
<i>And I know it is totally crazy</i>

218
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,401
<i>To dream I'd find romance</i>

219
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:33,409
<i>But for the first time in forever</i>

220
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,487
<i>At least I've got a chance!</i>

221
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,969
<i>Don't let them in</i>

222
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,402
<i>Don't let them see</i>

223
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,159
<i>Be the good girl</i>

224
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,930
<i>You always have to be</i>

225
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,246
<i>Conceal</i>

226
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,251
<i>Don't feel</i>

227
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,443
<i>Put on a show</i>

228
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,119
<i>Make one wrong move</i>

229
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,891
<i>And everyone will know</i>

230
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,679
<i>But it's only for today</i>

231
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,719
<i>It's only for today</i>

232
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,685
<i>It's agony to wait</i>

233
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,691
<i>Tell the guards to open up</i>

234
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,679
<i>The gate</i>

235
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,928
<i>The gate</i>

236
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,239
<i>For the first time in forever</i>

237
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,599
<i>Don't let them in
Don't let them see</i>

238
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,439
<i>I'm getting what I'm dreaming of</i>

239
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,519
<i>Be the good girl</i>

240
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,839
<i>You always have to be</i>

241
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,239
<i>A chance to change</i>

242
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,079
<i>My lonely world</i>

243
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,399
Conceal

244
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,719
<i>A chance to find true love</i>

245
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,799
<i>Conceal, don't feel
Don't let them know</i>

246
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,959
<i>I know it all ends tomorrow</i>

247
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,970
<i>So it has to be today!</i>

248
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,968
<i>'Cause for the first time in forever</i>

249
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,759
<i>For the first time</i>

250
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,362
<i>In forever</i>

251
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:01,325
<i>Nothing's in my way!</i>

252
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,119
Hey!

253
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,651
I'm so sorry. Are you hurt?

254
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,959
Hey.

255
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,959
Uh...
No, no, I'm okay.

256
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,159
Are you sure?

257
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,919
Yeah. I just wasn't looking
where I was going.

258
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,202
But I'm great, actually.

259
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,489
Oh... Thank goodness.

260
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,399
Oh! Uh...

261
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,329
Prince Hans of the Southern Isles.

262
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,649
Princess Anna of Arendelle.

263
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,119
"Princess"? My Lady.

264
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,526
Oh!

265
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,279
- Whoa.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...

266
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,845
- Um...
- Whew.

267
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,279
Hi. Again.

268
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,209
Oh, boy!

269
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,039
This is awkward.

270
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,719
Not "You're awkward,"
but just because we're...

271
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,241
I'm awkward, you're gorgeous.
Wait, what?

272
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,519
I'd like to formally apologize

273
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,927
for hitting the princess
of Arendelle with my horse.

274
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,199
And for every moment after.

275
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,799
No! No, no. It's fine.

276
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,119
I'm not that princess.

277
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,879
I mean, if you had
hit my sister Elsa,

278
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,719
it would be... Yeesh!

279
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,279
Because, you know...

280
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,679
Hello.

281
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,484
But, lucky you,

282
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,444
It's just me.

283
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,087
"Just" you?

284
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,245
The bells. The coronation.

285
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,359
I better go.

286
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,131
I have to go. I better go. Uh...

287
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,801
Bye!

288
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,324
Oh, no. Oh!

289
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,802
Your Majesty, the gloves.

290
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,604
Queen Elsa of Arendelle.

291
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,122
Queen Elsa of Arendelle!

292
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,771
Queen Elsa of Arendelle.

293
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,325
Princess Anna of Arendelle.

294
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,679
Oh. Here? Are you sure?

295
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,879
Because I don't think
I'm supposed to...

296
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,320
Oh. Okay.

297
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,447
Hi.

298
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,444
"Hi" me? Oh...

299
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,330
Um... Hi.

300
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,359
You look beautiful.

301
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,479
Thank you.
You look beautiful-ler.

302
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,039
I mean, not "fuller."
You don't look fuller.

303
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,159
But more beautiful.

304
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,169
Thank you.

305
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,526
So...

306
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,609
This is what a party looks like.

307
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,399
It's warmer than I thought.

308
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,679
What is that amazing smell?

309
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,726
Chocolate.

310
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,920
Your Majesty.

311
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,045
- The Duke of Weaseltown.
- "Weselton"!

312
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,044
Duke of Weselton, Your Majesty.

313
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,679
As your closest partner in
trade it seems only fitting

314
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,879
that I offer you

315
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,650
your first dance as queen.

316
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,365
One-two, and jump.

317
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,881
Uh...

318
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,919
Thank you. Only, I don't dance.

319
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,199
Oh...

320
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,239
But my sister does.

321
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,599
- What?
- Oh! Lucky you.

322
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,719
Oh, I don't think...

323
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,127
If you swoon, let me know.
I'll catch you.

324
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,839
Sorry.

325
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,719
Like an agile peacock.

326
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,639
Ow! Ow.

327
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,719
Speaking of, so great
to have the gates open.

328
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,922
Why did they shut them
in the first place?

329
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,719
Do you know the reason? Hmm?

330
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,559
- No.
- No.

331
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,091
All right. Hang on!

332
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,919
They don't call me
the "Little Dipper" for nothing!

333
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,079
Oh-ho!

334
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,727
Like a chicken with the face
of a monkey, I fly.

335
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,719
Let me know
when you're ready

336
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,919
for another round, Milady.

337
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,851
Well, he was sprightly.

338
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,079
Especially for a man in heels.

339
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,850
Are you okay?

340
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,649
I've never been better.
This is so nice.

341
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,122
I wish it could be
like this all the time.

342
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,960
Me, too.

343
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,679
But it can't.

344
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,882
- Why not?
- It just can't.

345
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,770
Excuse me for a minute.

346
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,249
I'd be honored.

347
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,881
Glad I caught you.

348
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,326
Hans.

349
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,365
Oop.

350
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,679
I often had a whole parlor
to myself to slide!

351
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,719
- Oh!
- Oops!

352
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,119
Sorry.

353
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,519
Your physique helps,
I'm sure, too.

354
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,006
Ah.

355
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,479
What's this?

356
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,959
Uh, I was born with it.

357
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,367
Although, I dreamed
I was kissed by a troll.

358
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,799
I like it.

359
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,479
Yeah, the whole thing.

360
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,761
You got it.

361
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,766
Okay, wait, wait.
So, you have how many brothers?

362
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,889
Twelve older brothers.

363
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:26,519
Three of them pretended I was
invisible, literally, for two years.

364
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,846
That's horrible.

365
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,486
It's what brothers do.

366
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,211
And sisters.

367
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,719
Elsa and I were really close
when we were little.

368
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,199
But then, one day,
she just shut me out,

369
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,721
and I never knew why.

370
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,199
I would never shut you out.

371
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,161
Okay, can I just say
something crazy?

372
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,766
I love crazy.

373
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:53,649
<i>All my life has been
A series of doors in my face</i>

374
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,599
<i>And then suddenly
I bump into you</i>

375
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,959
I was thinking the same
thing, because, like...

376
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,119
<i>I've been searching my whole life</i>

377
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,209
<i>To find my own place</i>

378
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,879
<i>And maybe it's the party talking</i>

379
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,959
<i>Or the chocolate fondue</i>

380
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,079
<i>But with you</i>

381
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,319
<i>But with you I found my place</i>

382
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,039
<i>I see your face</i>

383
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:17,039
<i>And it's nothing like
I've ever known before</i>

384
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,079
<i>Love is an open</i>

385
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,409
<i>Door!</i>

386
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,039
<i>Love is an open</i>

387
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,359
<i>- Door
- Door</i>

388
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,719
<i>Love is an open door</i>

389
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,479
<i>- With you
- With you</i>

390
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,445
<i>Love is an open door</i>

391
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,159
<i>- I mean, it's crazy</i>
- What?

392
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,522
<i>- We finish each other's
- Sandwiches</i>

393
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,759
That's what I was gonna say!

394
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,959
<i>I've never met someone</i>

395
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,079
<i>Who thinks so much like me</i>

396
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,559
Jinx! Jinx again!

397
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:56,209
<i>Our mental synchronization
Can have but one explanation</i>

398
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,679
<i>- You
- And I</i>

399
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,759
<i>- Were
- Just</i>

400
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,450
<i>Meant to be</i>

401
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,959
<i>- Say goodbye
- Say goodbye</i>

402
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,004
<i>To the pain of the past</i>

403
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,649
<i>We don't have to feel it anymore</i>

404
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,846
<i>Love is an open door</i>

405
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,199
<i>Love is an open</i>

406
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,399
<i>- Door
- Door</i>

407
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,319
<i>Life can be so much more</i>

408
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,319
<i>- With you
- With you</i>

409
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,679
<i>Love is an open</i>

410
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:29,362
<i>- Door
- Door</i>

411
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,649
Can I say something crazy?

412
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,644
Will you marry me?

413
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,844
Can I say something even crazier?

414
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,401
Yes!

415
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,769
- Coming through.
- Excuse me. Oh...

416
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,559
- Pardon. Sorry.
- Oh!

417
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,285
Can we just get around you there?

418
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,444
Thank you. Oh! There she is.

419
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,639
Elsa!

420
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,479
I mean, Queen. Me again. Um...

421
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,287
May I present Prince Hans
of the Southern Isles.

422
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,170
Your Majesty.

423
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,759
We would like...

424
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,879
Uh, your blessing...

425
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,004
Of our marriage.

426
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,284
- Marriage?
- Yes!

427
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,839
I'm sorry, I'm confused.

428
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,159
Well, we haven't worked out
all the details ourselves.

429
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,079
We'll need a few days
to plan the ceremony.

430
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,399
Of course, we'll have soup, roast
and ice cream. And then...

431
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,761
Wait. Would we live here?

432
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,999
- Here?
- Absolutely!

433
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,079
- Anna!
- Oh!

434
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,679
We can invite all 12 of your
brothers to stay with us.

435
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,959
What? No, no, no.

436
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,288
- Of course we have the room.
- Wait, slow down.

437
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,319
No one's brothers are staying here.

438
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,885
No one is getting married.

439
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,519
Wait, what?

440
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,564
May I talk to you, please? Alone.

441
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,801
No. Whatever you have to say,
you can say to both of us.

442
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,206
Fine. You can't marry
a man you just met.

443
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,239
You can if it's true love.

444
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,239
Anna, what do you know
about true love?

445
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,359
More than you.

446
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,199
All you know is how
to shut people out.

447
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,171
You asked for my blessing,
but my answer is no.

448
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,799
Now, excuse me.

449
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,439
Your Majesty,
if I may ease your...

450
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,722
No, you may not.
And I think you should go.

451
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,839
The party is over. Close the gates.

452
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,919
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- What?

453
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,599
Elsa, no, no! Wait.

454
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,801
Give me my glove!

455
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,719
Elsa, please, please.

456
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,604
I can't live like this anymore!

457
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,527
Then leave.

458
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,719
What did I ever do to you?

459
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,919
Enough, Anna.

460
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,168
No, why?
Why do you shut me out?

461
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,885
Why do you shut the world out?

462
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,724
What are you so afraid of?

463
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,690
I said, enough!

464
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,206
Sorcery.

465
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,286
I knew there was something
dubious going on here.

466
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,246
Elsa.

467
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,441
There she is!

468
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,359
Yes! It is her!

469
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,686
Queen Elsa.

470
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,450
Our beautiful queen!

471
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,928
Your Majesty?
Are you all right?

472
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,281
No.

473
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,246
There she is! Stop her!

474
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,479
Please, just stay away from me.
Stay away.

475
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,962
Monster. Monster!

476
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,006
Elsa!

477
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,924
Elsa!

478
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,280
Wait, please!

479
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,639
Elsa, stop!

480
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,999
Anna!

481
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,201
No.

482
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,166
The fjord.

483
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,924
- Snow!
- Snow?

484
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,199
Yes, snow.

485
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,119
- Are you all right?
- No.

486
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,765
Did you know?

487
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,487
No.

488
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,839
Look, it's snowing.
It's snowing!

489
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,559
The queen has cursed this land!

490
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,799
She must be stopped!
You have to go after her.

491
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,199
Wait, no!

492
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,719
You! ls there sorcery in you, too?

493
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,359
Are you a monster, too?

494
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,359
No, no. I'm completely ordinary.

495
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,050
That's right, she is.

496
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,524
In the best way.

497
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,159
And my sister is not a monster.

498
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,799
She nearly killed me!

499
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,399
- You slipped on ice.
- Her ice.

500
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,841
It was an accident. She was scared.

501
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,891
She didn't mean it.
She didn't mean any of this.

502
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,639
Tonight was my fault.
I pushed her.

503
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,039
So, I'm the one

504
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,319
- that needs to go after her.
- What?

505
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,719
- Bring me my horse, please.
- Anna, no.

506
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,126
It's too dangerous.

507
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,130
Elsa is not dangerous.

508
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,279
I'll bring her back,
and I'll make this right.

509
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,359
I'm coming with you.

510
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,769
No, I need you here
to take care of Arendelle.

511
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,765
On my honor.

512
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,445
I leave Prince Hans in charge.

513
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,125
Are you sure you can trust her?

514
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,171
I don't want you getting hurt.

515
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,801
She's my sister.

516
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,731
She would never hurt me.

517
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,959
<i>The snow glows white
On the mountain tonight</i>

518
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,164
<i>Not a footprint to be seen</i>

519
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,959
<i>A kingdom of isolation</i>

520
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:38,006
<i>And it looks like
I'm the queen</i>

521
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,559
<i>The wind is howling</i>

522
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:44,481
<i>Like this swirling storm inside</i>

523
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:50,362
<i>Couldn't keep it in
Heaven knows I tried</i>

524
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,799
<i>Don't let them in
Don't let them see</i>

525
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:59,319
<i>Be the good girl
You always have to be</i>

526
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:04,242
<i>Conceal, don't feel
Don't let them know</i>

527
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,689
<i>Well, now they know</i>

528
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:12,408
<i>Let it go!
Let it go!</i>

529
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,769
<i>Can't hold me back anymore</i>

530
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,249
<i>Let it go!
Let it go!</i>

531
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,803
<i>Turn away and slam the door</i>

532
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,919
<i>I don't care</i>

533
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:29,408
<i>What they're going to say</i>

534
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:33,448
<i>Let the storm rage on</i>

535
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,731
<i>The cold never bothered me anyway</i>

536
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:47,043
<i>It's funny how some distance
Makes everything seem small</i>

537
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:51,039
<i>And the fears that once controlled me</i>

538
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:55,131
<i>Can't get to me at all</i>

539
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:58,959
<i>It's time to see what I can do</i>

540
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,519
<i>To test the limits and break through</i>

541
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,039
<i>No right, no wrong</i>

542
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,322
<i>No rules for me</i>

543
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,564
<i>I'm free!</i>

544
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,691
<i>Let it go!</i>

545
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,610
<i>Let it go!</i>

546
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:17,079
<i>I am one with the wind and sky</i>

547
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:20,602
<i>Let it go!
Let it go!</i>

548
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:24,328
<i>You'll never see me cry</i>

549
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:28,279
<i>Here I stand</i>

550
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,131
<i>And here I'll stay</i>

551
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,007
<i>Let the storm rage on</i>

552
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,039
<i>My power flurries through the air</i>

553
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,403
<i>Into the ground</i>

554
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:54,319
<i>My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals</i>

555
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,648
<i>All around</i>

556
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:02,080
<i>And one thought crystallizes
Like an icy blast</i>

557
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,686
<i>I'm never going back</i>

558
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:11,091
<i>The past is in the past</i>

559
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,684
<i>Let it go!
Let it go!</i>

560
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:18,599
<i>And I'll rise like the break of dawn</i>

561
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:22,009
<i>Let it go!
Let it go!</i>

562
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:26,199
<i>That perfect girl is gone</i>

563
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,759
<i>Here I stand</i>

564
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:32,681
<i>In the light of day</i>

565
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,605
<i>Let the storm rage on!</i>

566
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:43,211
<i>The cold never bothered me anyway</i>

567
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,651
Elsa!

568
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,200
Elsa!

569
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,604
Elsa, it's me, Anna,

570
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,850
your sister who didn't mean
to make you freeze the summer.

571
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,169
I'm sorry.
It's all my fault.

572
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,079
Of course, none of it
would have happened

573
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,044
if she had just told me her secret.

574
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,211
She's a stinker.

575
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,405
Whoa!

576
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,846
Oh, no. No, no, no!
Come back!

577
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,411
No, no, no!

578
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,651
Okay.

579
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,368
Snow. It had to be snow.

580
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,439
She couldn't have
had tropical magic

581
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,008
that covered the fjords
in white sand and warm...

582
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,279
Fire!

583
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,730
Cold, cold, cold, cold, cold.

584
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,724
Ooh. "And sauna"!

585
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,611
- Yoo-hoo.
- Hmm?

586
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,166
Big summer blowout.

587
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,599
Half off swimming suits, clogs,

588
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,406
and a sun balm of my
own invention, yah?

589
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,002
Oh. Great.
For now, um, how about boots?

590
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,324
Winter boots and dresses?

591
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,769
That would be in our
winter department.

592
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,131
Oh. Um...

593
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,799
I was just wondering.

594
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,048
Has another young woman...

595
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,719
The queen perhaps,
I don't know,

596
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,959
passed through here?

597
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,439
The only one crazy enough
to be out in this storm

598
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,449
is you, dear.

599
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,479
You and this fellow.

600
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,519
Yoo-hoo.

601
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,846
Big summer blowout.

602
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,999
Carrots.

603
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,326
Huh?

604
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,251
Behind you.

605
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,569
Oh! Right. Excuse me.

606
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,842
Oh. A real howler in July, yes?

607
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,404
Wherever could it be coming from?

608
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,611
The North Mountain.

609
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,520
North Mountain.

610
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,119
That will be 40.

611
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,879
Forty? No, 10.

612
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,127
Oh, dear, that's no good.

613
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,159
See, this is from our winter stock,

614
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,159
where supply and demand
have a big problem.

615
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,362
You want to talk about
a supply and demand problem?

616
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,727
I sell ice for a living.

617
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,999
Ooh. That's a rough business
to be in right now.

618
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,359
I mean, that is really...

619
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,721
That's unfortunate.

620
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,999
Still 40.

621
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,248
But I will throw in
a visit to Oaken's sauna.

622
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,409
Yoo-hoo. Hi, family.

623
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,086
Yoo-hoo!

624
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,841
Ten is all I got. Help me out.

625
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,801
Okay. Ten will get you
this and no more.

626
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,079
Okay, just tell me one thing.

627
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,039
What was happening
on the North Mountain?

628
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,959
Did it seem magical?

629
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,650
Yes!

630
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,085
Now, back up while I deal
with this crook, here.

631
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,651
What did you call me?

632
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,410
Okay, okay. I'm out.

633
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,799
Whoa!

634
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,286
Bye-bye.

635
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,441
No, Sven,
I didn't get your carrots.

636
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,364
But I did find us a place to sleep.

637
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,570
And it's free.

638
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,491
I'm sorry about this violence.

639
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,250
I will add a quart of lutefisk,

640
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,091
so we have good feelings.

641
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,930
Just the outfit and the boots, yah?

642
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,361
Uh...

643
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,884
<i>Reindeers are better than people</i>

644
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,843
<i>Sven, don't you think that's true?</i>

645
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,239
<i>"Yeah, people will beat you
And curse you and cheat you</i>

646
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,841
<i>"Every one of them's bad,
except you"</i>

647
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,804
Aw. Thanks, buddy.

648
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,449
<i>But people smell better
than reindeers</i>

649
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,765
<i>Sven, don't you think I'm right?</i>

650
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:12,167
<i>"That's once again true
For all, except you"</i>

651
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:15,479
<i>You got me
Let's call it a night</i>

652
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,409
<i>"Good night"</i>

653
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,125
<i>Don't let the frostbite</i>

654
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,601
<i>Bite</i>

655
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,845
Nice duet.

656
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,926
It's just you.
What do you want?

657
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,562
I want you to take me up
the North Mountain.

658
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,490
I don't take people places.

659
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,759
Let me rephrase that.

660
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,405
Hey.

661
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,486
Take me up the North Mountain.

662
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,164
Please.

663
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,362
Look, I know how to
stop this winter.

664
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,330
We leave at dawn.

665
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,922
And you forgot the
carrots for Sven.

666
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,999
Oops, sorry.

667
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,487
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't...

668
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,207
We leave now. Right now.

669
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,486
Whew!

670
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,399
Hang on! We like to go fast.

671
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,919
- I like fast.
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa...

672
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,639
Get your feet down.
This is fresh lacquer.

673
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,239
Seriously,
were you raised in a barn?

674
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,679
Ugh!

675
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,486
- No, I was raised in a castle.
- Hmm.

676
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,405
So, uh, tell me,

677
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,643
what made the queen
go all ice-crazy?

678
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,881
Oh. Well...

679
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,640
It was all my fault.

680
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,119
I got engaged,
but then she freaked out,

681
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,971
because I'd only just met him,
you know, that day.

682
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,879
And she said she wouldn't
bless the marriage, and...

683
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,439
Wait. You got engaged
to someone you just met that day?

684
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,759
Yeah. Anyway, I got mad,
and so she got mad,

685
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,879
and then she tried to walk away,
and I grabbed her glove...

686
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,039
Hang on!

687
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,999
You mean to tell me you got engaged

688
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,679
to someone you just met that day?

689
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,120
Yes. Pay attention.

690
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,199
But the thing is, she wore
the gloves all the time,

691
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,639
so I just thought, maybe
she has a thing about dirt.

692
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,684
Didn't your parents ever
warn you about strangers?

693
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,169
Yes, they did.

694
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,961
But Hans is not a stranger.

695
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,959
Oh, yeah? What's his last name?

696
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,559
"Of the Southern Isles."

697
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,999
- What's his favorite food?
- Sandwiches.

698
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,399
- Best friend's name?
- Probably John.

699
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,519
- Eye color?
- Dreamy.

700
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,079
- Foot size?
- Foot size doesn't matter.

701
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,919
Have you had a meal with him yet?
What if you hate the way he eats?

702
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,531
What if you hate the
way he picks his nose?

703
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,801
Picks his nose?

704
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,999
And eats it.

705
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,601
Excuse me, sir.
He is a prince.

706
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,125
- All men do it.
- Ew.

707
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,559
Look, it doesn't matter.
It's true love.

708
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:46,526
- It doesn't sound like true love.
- Are you some sort of love expert?

709
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,806
No. But, uh,
I have friends who are.

710
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,239
You have friends

711
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,639
who are love experts?
I'm not buying it.

712
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,319
- Stop talking.
- No, no, no. No, no.

713
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,090
- I'd like to meet these...
- No, I mean it.

714
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,159
Sven, go.

715
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,407
Go!

716
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,479
- What are they?
- Wolves.

717
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,727
Wolves?

718
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,479
- What do we do?
- I got this.

719
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,759
You just...
Don't fall off, and don't get eaten.

720
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,799
But I want to help!

721
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,919
- No.
- Why not?

722
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:26,999
Because I don't trust
your judgment.

723
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,279
Excuse me?

724
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,119
Who marries a man she just met?

725
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,439
It's true love!

726
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,679
Whoa!

727
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,291
Whoa. Whoa!

728
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,885
Christopher!

729
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,319
It's "Kristoff"!

730
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,851
Ow!

731
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,119
Duck!

732
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,759
You almost set me on fire!

733
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,961
But I didn't.

734
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,759
Get ready to jump, Sven!

735
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,279
You don't tell him what to do.

736
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,845
- Hey!
- I do!

737
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,879
Jump, Sven!

738
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,121
Phew!

739
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,886
But I just paid it off.

740
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,044
Uh-oh. No. No.

741
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,519
No!

742
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,399
Ah! No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

743
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,681
Grab on!

744
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,199
Pull, Sven. Pull!

745
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,239
Whoa.

746
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,688
I'll replace your sled,
and everything in it.

747
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:48,281
And I understand if you don't
want to help me anymore.

748
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,446
Of course I don't want to help
her anymore. In fact,

749
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,039
this whole thing has ruined me
for helping anyone ever again.

750
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,079
It's this way?

751
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,199
"She'll die on her own."

752
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,084
- I can live with that.
- Here we go.

753
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:08,319
"But you won't get
your new sled if she's dead."

754
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,931
I think, actually, it's up.

755
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,399
Sometimes, I really don't like you.

756
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,921
Hold up! We're coming.

757
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,399
You are?

758
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:18,559
I mean, sure.
I'll let you tag along.

759
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,205
Arendelle.

760
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,928
It's completely frozen.

761
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:38,079
But it will be fine.
Elsa will thaw it.

762
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,439
Will she?

763
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,119
Yeah. Now, come on.

764
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,959
This way to the North Mountain?

765
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,599
More like this way.

766
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:22,162
I never knew winter
could be so beautiful.

767
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,559
Yeah.

768
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,683
It really is beautiful, isn't it?

769
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,361
But it's so white.

770
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,610
You know, how about a little color?

771
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,999
I'm thinking maybe some
crimson, chartreuse.

772
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,645
How about yellow?

773
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,963
No, not yellow.
Yellow and snow?

774
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,479
No go.

775
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,930
Am I right?

776
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,239
- Hi.
- You're creepy.

777
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,639
- Whoa!
- I don't want it.

778
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,079
- Back at you.
- Please don't drop me.

779
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,359
- No.
- Come on, it's just a head.

780
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,679
All right.
We got off to a bad start.

781
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,086
Ew, ew, ew, the body!

782
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,799
Wait, what am I
looking at right now?

783
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,519
Why are you hanging off
the earth like a bat?

784
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:02,999
All right, wait one second.

785
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,531
Oh. Uh...

786
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,759
Oh!

787
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,325
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

788
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,399
Now, I'm perfect.

789
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,086
Well, almost.

790
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,159
It was like my whole life
got turned upside down.

791
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,441
Oh! Too hard. I'm sorry!

792
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,359
- Head rush!
- I was just... Are you okay?

793
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:20,879
Are you kidding me?
I am wonderful!

794
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,730
I've always wanted a nose.

795
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,119
So cute.

796
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,879
It's like a little baby unicorn.

797
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:26,999
But... Hey! Whoa!

798
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,039
Oh.

799
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,049
I love it even more.

800
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:33,085
All right, let's start this thing over.

801
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,239
Hi, everyone.

802
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,319
I'm Olaf.

803
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:36,726
And I like warm hugs.

804
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,281
Olaf?

805
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,409
That's right. Olaf.

806
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,608
And you are?

807
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,081
Oh. Um...

808
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:50,239
I'm Anna.

809
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,679
And who's the funky-looking
donkey over there?

810
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,239
- That's Sven.
- Uh-huh.

811
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,199
And who's the reindeer?

812
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,239
Sven.

813
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:00,079
Oh, the... Oh. Okay.
That makes things easier for me.

814
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,760
Aw, look at him
trying to kiss my nose.

815
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,883
- I like you, too.
- Olaf.

816
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,522
- Did Elsa build you?
- Yeah. Why?

817
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:08,759
Do you know where she is?

818
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:09,919
- Fascinating.
- Yeah. Why?

819
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,479
Do you think you could
show us the way?

820
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:12,681
Yeah. Why?

821
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,119
How does this work? Ow!

822
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:16,359
Stop it, Sven.
I'm trying to focus, here.

823
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,562
- Yeah. Why?
- I'll tell you why.

824
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,645
We need Elsa to bring back summer.

825
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,519
- Summer?
- Mmm-hmm.

826
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:23,839
Oh. I don't know why,

827
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,599
but I've always loved
the idea of summer.

828
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:31,199
And sun, and all things hot.

829
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,279
Really?

830
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,839
I'm guessing you don't have
much experience with heat.

831
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,121
Nope.

832
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,759
But sometimes I like
to close my eyes,

833
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:42,806
and imagine what it would be
like when summer does come.

834
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:50,119
<i>Bees will buzz
Kids will blow dandelion fuzz</i>

835
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:55,087
<i>And I'll be doing
Whatever snow does in summer</i>

836
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,839
<i>A drink in my hand</i>

837
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:01,239
<i>My snow up against the burning sand</i>

838
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,519
<i>Probably getting gorgeously tanned</i>

839
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,290
<i>In summer</i>

840
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,879
<i>I'll finally see a summer breeze</i>

841
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:09,999
<i>Blow away a winter storm</i>

842
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,279
<i>And find out what happens
to solid water</i>

843
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:15,211
<i>When it gets warm</i>

844
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,999
<i>And I can't wait to see</i>

845
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,043
<i>What my buddies all think of me</i>

846
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:23,799
<i>Just imagine how much cooler I'll be</i>

847
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,207
<i>In summer!</i>

848
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,679
<i>The hot and the cold
are both so intense</i>

849
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:35,247
<i>Put them together
It just makes sense</i>

850
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,679
<i>Winter's a good time
To stay in and cuddle</i>

851
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,723
<i>But put me in summer and I'll be a...</i>

852
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,599
<i>Happy snowman!</i>

853
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,879
<i>When life gets rough</i>

854
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:50,401
<i>I like to hold on to my dream</i>

855
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:55,407
<i>Relaxing in the summer sun
Just letting off steam</i>

856
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,559
<i>Oh, the sky</i>

857
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,285
<i>Will be blue</i>

858
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:03,724
<i>And you guys will be there, too</i>

859
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,679
<i>When I finally do</i>

860
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:09,168
<i>What frozen things do
In summer!</i>

861
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,884
- I'm gonna tell him.
- Don't you dare.

862
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,687
<i>In summer!</i>

863
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,559
So, come on! Elsa's this way.

864
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,759
Let's go bring back summer!

865
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,200
I'm coming!

866
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,525
Somebody's gotta tell him.

867
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:38,039
No, no. You've got
the bark facing down.

868
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,765
The bark needs to be face-up.

869
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:42,239
- Bark down is drier.
- Bark up!

870
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,279
- Bark down!
- Papa!

871
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,999
Cloak? Does anyone need a cloak?

872
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,199
Arendelle is indebted to you,
Your Highness.

873
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,559
The castle is open.

874
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,730
There is soup and hot
glogg in the great hall.

875
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:53,919
Here, pass these out.

876
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,479
Prince Hans!

877
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,999
Are we expected
to just sit here and freeze

878
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,646
while you give away all
of Arendelle's tradable goods?

879
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,399
Princess Anna has given her orders.

880
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,199
And that's another thing!

881
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,799
Has it dawned on you that your
princess may be conspiring

882
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,119
with a wicked sorceress

883
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,199
to destroy us all?

884
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,970
Do not question the princess.

885
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:12,479
She left me in charge

886
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,799
and I will not hesitate

887
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,525
to protect Arendelle
from treason.

888
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,279
Treason?

889
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:23,719
Whoa! Whoa!

890
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,519
Whoa, boy. Easy.

891
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:26,801
Easy.

892
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:28,120
It's Princess Anna's horse.

893
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,925
So, where is the princess?

894
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,120
- Where could she be?
- Where is she?

895
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,805
Princess Anna is in trouble.

896
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:37,159
I need volunteers to go
with me to find her.

897
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,399
- I'll go.
- I volunteer.

898
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,568
I volunteer two men, My Lord.

899
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,491
Be prepared for anything.

900
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,842
And should you
encounter the queen,

901
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,966
you are to put an
end to this winter.

902
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,091
- Do you understand?
- Hmm.

903
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:57,205
So, how exactly are you
planning to stop this weather?

904
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:00,081
Oh. I am gonna talk to my sister.

905
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,479
That's your plan?

906
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:04,359
My ice business is riding on
you talking to your sister?

907
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:05,766
Yep.

908
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,885
So, you're not at
all afraid of her?

909
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:09,890
- Why would I be?
- Yeah.

910
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:14,643
I bet she's the nicest,
gentlest, warmest person ever.

911
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:16,799
Oh. Look at that.

912
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,207
I've been impaled.

913
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,527
What now?

914
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,009
Mmm...

915
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:28,799
It's too steep.

916
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,319
I've only got one rope and you
don't know how to climb mountains.

917
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,679
Says who?

918
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:34,120
Hmm?

919
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:35,561
What are you doing?

920
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:39,646
I'm going to see my sister.

921
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:41,241
You're gonna kill yourself.

922
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,839
I wouldn't put my foot there.

923
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,690
- You're distracting me.
- Or there.

924
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:47,639
How do you know
Elsa even wants to see you?

925
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,399
All right.
I'm just blocking you out

926
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:52,251
because I gotta concentrate, here.

927
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:53,919
You know,
most people who disappear

928
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,451
into the mountains
want to be alone.

929
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,882
Nobody wants to be alone.

930
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,399
Except maybe you.

931
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,649
I'm not alone.
I have friends, remember?

932
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,364
You mean, the love experts?

933
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,563
Yes, the love experts.

934
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:09,764
Ah...

935
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,090
Please tell me I'm almost there.

936
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,519
Does the air seem a bit
thin to you up here?

937
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,119
Hang on.

938
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,321
Hey, Sven?

939
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,239
Not sure if this is gonna
solve the problem,

940
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:23,279
but I found a staircase
that leads exactly

941
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,479
where you wanted to go.

942
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,599
Ha-ha! Thank goodness.
Catch!

943
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,886
Thanks. That was like a
crazy trust exercise.

944
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:45,759
Whoa.

945
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,803
Now, that's ice.

946
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:49,799
I might cry.

947
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,571
Go ahead. I won't judge.

948
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,759
All right, take it easy, boy.
Come here.

949
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,485
I got you.

950
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,327
Okay.
You stay right here, buddy.

951
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:09,606
Flawless.

952
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:15,881
Knock.

953
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,211
Just knock.

954
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,770
Why isn't she knocking?

955
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,165
Do you think she knows
how to knock?

956
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,959
Huh. It opened.

957
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:31,446
That's a first.

958
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:34,519
Oh. You should probably
wait out here.

959
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,639
- What?
- The last time I introduced her to a guy,

960
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:37,999
she froze everything.

961
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,919
But, but... Oh, come on!

962
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,885
It's a palace made of ice.
Ice is my life!

963
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:43,999
Bye, Sven.

964
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,770
You, too, Olaf.

965
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,929
- Me?
- Just give us a minute.

966
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,526
Okay.

967
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,290
One, two,

968
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,724
- three...
- Four...

969
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,281
Whoa.

970
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,561
Elsa?

971
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,443
It's me, Anna.

972
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:15,965
Anna.

973
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:23,162
Whoa. Elsa, you look different.

974
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,290
It's a good different.

975
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,926
And this place...

976
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:28,566
It's amazing.

977
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:29,881
Thank you.

978
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:32,282
I never knew what I was capable of.

979
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,479
I'm so sorry about what happened.
If I'd have known...

980
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:36,806
No, no, no. It's okay.

981
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:41,090
You don't have to apologize,
but you should probably go.

982
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:42,879
Please.

983
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,241
But I just got here.

984
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:46,564
You belong down in Arendelle.

985
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:47,879
So do you.

986
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:50,208
No, Anna, I belong here.

987
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,401
Alone.

988
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:56,850
Where I can be who I am
without hurting anybody.

989
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,083
Actually, about that...

990
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,370
- Sixty!
- Wait. What is that?

991
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:04,526
Hi! I'm Olaf and
I like warm hugs!

992
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:06,367
Olaf?

993
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,281
Yeah. You built me.

994
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,041
Remember that?

995
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,647
And you're alive?

996
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,602
Um... I think so.

997
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:18,686
He's just like the one
we built as kids.

998
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,046
Yeah.

999
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,449
Elsa, we were so close.

1000
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:25,524
We can be like that again.

1001
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:28,480
- Catch me!
- Slow down!

1002
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:33,161
Anna!

1003
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:36,759
No.

1004
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:39,440
We can't. Goodbye, Anna.

1005
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,559
Elsa, wait.

1006
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,759
No, I'm just trying
to protect you.

1007
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:45,611
You don't have to protect me.
I'm not afraid.

1008
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,283
Please don't shut me out again.

1009
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:50,519
<i>Please don't slam the door</i>

1010
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:54,599
<i>You don't have to keep
Your distance anymore</i>

1011
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:57,610
<i>'Cause for the first time in forever</i>

1012
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,799
<i>I finally understand</i>

1013
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,159
<i>For the first time in forever</i>

1014
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,439
<i>We can fix this hand in hand</i>

1015
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:06,608
We can head down
this mountain together.

1016
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:09,639
<i>You don't have to live in fear</i>

1017
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:13,561
<i>'Cause for the first time in forever</i>

1018
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:16,919
<i>I will be right here</i>

1019
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,199
Anna.

1020
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,119
<i>Please go back home</i>

1021
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:21,890
<i>Your life awaits</i>

1022
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:26,239
<i>Go enjoy the sun
And open up the gates</i>

1023
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:27,719
- Yeah, but...
- I know.

1024
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:32,050
<i>You mean well
But leave me be</i>

1025
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:33,559
<i>Yes, I'm alone</i>

1026
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:36,519
<i>But I'm alone and free</i>

1027
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:41,282
<i>Just stay away
And you'll be safe from me</i>

1028
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:43,521
<i>Actually, we're not</i>

1029
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:44,759
<i>What do you mean, you're not?</i>

1030
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,319
<i>I get the feeling you don't know</i>

1031
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,681
<i>What do I not know?</i>

1032
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,399
<i>Arendelle's in deep, deep, deep</i>

1033
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,682
<i>Deep snow</i>

1034
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:55,041
What?

1035
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:59,002
You kind of set off an
eternal winter everywhere.

1036
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,359
Everywhere?

1037
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:02,279
Well, it's okay,
you can just unfreeze it.

1038
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:04,528
No, I can't. I don't know how.

1039
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:07,081
Sure you can. I know you can.

1040
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,801
<i>'Cause for the first time in forever</i>

1041
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,519
<i>Oh, I'm such a fool!
I can't be free!</i>

1042
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,882
<i>You don't have to be afraid</i>

1043
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,839
<i>No escape from the storm inside of me</i>

1044
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:20,839
<i>We can work this out together</i>

1045
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,719
<i>I can't control the curse!</i>

1046
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:26,039
<i>We'll reverse the storm you've made</i>

1047
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:29,119
<i>Anna, please you'll only make it worse!</i>

1048
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:31,319
<i>Don't panic
There's so much fear!</i>

1049
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:32,919
<i>We'll make the sun shine bright</i>

1050
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,319
<i>You're not safe here!</i>

1051
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:36,039
<i>We can face this thing together</i>

1052
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,119
<i>No!</i>

1053
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,279
<i>We can change this winter weather</i>

1054
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:42,768
<i>And everything will be all right</i>

1055
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:45,761
<i>I can't!</i>

1056
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:54,441
Anna!

1057
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,201
Are you okay?

1058
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:57,479
I'm okay.

1059
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:58,920
I'm fine.

1060
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,159
Who's this?

1061
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,771
Wait, it doesn't matter. Just...

1062
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:03,199
You have to go.

1063
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,999
No, I know we can
figure this out together.

1064
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,079
How?

1065
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:09,442
What power do you have
to stop this winter?

1066
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:11,046
To stop me?

1067
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,559
Anna, I think we should go.

1068
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:14,559
No, I'm not leaving
without you, Elsa.

1069
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,444
Yes, you are.

1070
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:26,799
Stop! Put us down!

1071
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,604
Go away.

1072
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,565
Heads up!

1073
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,439
Watch out for my butt!

1074
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:39,959
It is not nice to throw people!

1075
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:42,199
Whoa, whoa, whoa, feisty-pants.
Okay, relax.

1076
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:44,599
- Just calm down! Calm down!
- Okay! All right!

1077
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,279
- I'm okay.
- Just let the snowman be.

1078
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,599
- I'm calm.
- Great.

1079
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,325
Oh! Come on!

1080
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,839
Oh. Look, see?
Now, you made him mad.

1081
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,804
I'll distract him. You guys go.

1082
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,331
No, no! Not you guys!

1083
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,480
This just got
a whole lot harder.

1084
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:06,321
Look out!

1085
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,684
Run! Run!

1086
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,763
What are you doing?

1087
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:27,441
I got him!

1088
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:29,159
Whoa! Stop!

1089
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:30,407
It's a 100-foot drop.

1090
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:32,007
It's 200.

1091
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,521
OW!

1092
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,199
- What's that for?
- I'm digging a snow anchor.

1093
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,890
Okay. What if we fall?

1094
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:40,119
There's 20 feet of fresh
powder down there.

1095
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:41,879
It'll be like landing on a pillow.

1096
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:42,959
Hopefully.

1097
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,199
Okay, Anna. On three.

1098
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:49,559
- Okay.
- One...

1099
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:50,639
You tell me when. I'm ready to go.

1100
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,279
- Two...
- I was born ready! Yes!

1101
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:53,561
Calm down.

1102
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:57,679
Tree!

1103
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:58,961
What the... Whoa!

1104
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:01,604
That happened.

1105
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:05,519
Man, am I out of shape.

1106
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,519
There we go. Hey, Anna!

1107
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:14,359
Sven! Where did you guys go?

1108
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:17,211
We totally lost
Marshmallow back there.

1109
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:20,039
Hey! We were just
talking about you.

1110
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:22,208
All good things, all good things.

1111
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:23,721
No!

1112
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:30,199
This is not making much
of a difference, is it?

1113
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:32,799
Olaf!

1114
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,764
Hang in there, guys!

1115
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:35,959
Go. Go faster!

1116
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:39,810
- Wait, what?
- Hey!

1117
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,599
Ow!

1118
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,079
Kristoff!

1119
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:50,808
Don't come back!

1120
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:52,521
We won't.

1121
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:03,484
Hey, you were right. Just like a pillow.

1122
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:04,886
Olaf!

1123
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:07,999
I can't feel my legs!
I can't feel my legs!

1124
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:11,559
- Those are my legs.
- Ooh!

1125
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:13,079
Hey, do me a favor,
grab my butt.

1126
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:15,169
Oh. That feels better.

1127
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,921
Hey, Sven! He found us.

1128
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,159
Who's my cute little reindeer?

1129
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:22,279
Don't talk to him like that.

1130
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:24,164
You're tickling me.

1131
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,281
Here.

1132
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:27,599
Whoa!

1133
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,799
Are you okay?

1134
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,365
Thank you.

1135
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,526
- How's your head?
- Ah! Ooh!

1136
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:35,439
It's fine. Uh...

1137
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:37,119
Uh, I'm good.
I've got a thick skull.

1138
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:39,129
I don't have a skull.

1139
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:40,921
Or bones.

1140
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:43,641
So, uh... So, now what?

1141
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:45,799
Now what?

1142
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,199
Now what?

1143
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,481
Oh...

1144
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:50,040
What am I gonna do?

1145
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:51,839
She threw me out.

1146
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:54,199
I can't go back to Arendelle
with the weather like this.

1147
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:55,279
And then there's your ice business.

1148
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:58,006
Hey, hey.
Don't worry about my ice business.

1149
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:00,759
- Worry about your hair!
- What?

1150
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:02,639
I just fell off a cliff.
You should see your hair.

1151
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:04,359
No, yours is turning white.

1152
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:07,279
White? It's... What?

1153
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,482
It's because she struck you,
isn't it?

1154
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:11,690
Does it look bad?

1155
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,039
- No.
- You hesitated.

1156
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:15,287
No, I didn't.

1157
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,559
Anna, you need help, okay?
Come on.

1158
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:19,250
Okay! Where are we going?

1159
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:20,359
To see my friends.

1160
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:21,679
The love experts?

1161
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,530
- Love experts?
- Uh-huh.

1162
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:26,159
And don't worry,
they'll be able to fix this.

1163
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,010
How do you know?

1164
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:30,723
Because I've seen
them do it before.

1165
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:34,159
I like to consider myself
a love expert.

1166
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:40,570
Get it together.

1167
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,559
Control it.

1168
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:44,364
Don't feel. Don't feel.

1169
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,490
Don't feel.

1170
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:48,324
Don't feel!

1171
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:05,407
Look, Sven, the sky is awake.

1172
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,569
- Are you cold?
- A little.

1173
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:14,959
Uh...
Wait. Come here.

1174
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:16,241
Huh?

1175
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,251
Ooh.

1176
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:22,919
So, uh, about my friends. Well...

1177
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:24,359
I say "friends"...

1178
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:26,399
They're more like family.

1179
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:29,399
Anyway, when I was a kid,
it was just me and Sven.

1180
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:31,489
Until they, you know,
kinda took us in.

1181
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,365
- They did?
- Yeah.

1182
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:34,679
I don't want to scare you.

1183
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:39,119
They can be a little
inappropriate and loud.

1184
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:40,685
Very loud.

1185
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:42,679
They are also stubborn at times,

1186
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:43,959
and a little overbearing.

1187
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:46,759
And heavy.
Really, really, heavy.

1188
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:49,119
But you'll get it.
They mean well.

1189
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:51,448
Kristoff, they sound wonderful.

1190
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:54,971
Okay, then.

1191
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:57,489
Meet my family.

1192
01:03:58,200 --> 01:03:59,401
Hey, guys.

1193
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,450
They're rocks.

1194
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:03,799
You are a sight for sore eyes.

1195
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:06,731
He's crazy.

1196
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:09,488
Rocko's looking sharp, as usual.

1197
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:11,919
Clay, whoa...
I don't even recognize you.

1198
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,039
You lost so much weight.

1199
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:15,999
I'll distract him while you run.

1200
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,123
Hi, Sven's family!

1201
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:20,801
It's nice to meet you.

1202
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:23,439
Because I love you,
Anna, I insist you run.

1203
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:27,531
I understand
you're love experts. Ooh!

1204
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,490
Why aren't you running?

1205
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:30,799
Uh...

1206
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:33,287
Okay. Well, I'm gonna go.

1207
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:35,444
- Go.
- No, no, no. Anna, wait.

1208
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:39,490
Kristoff!

1209
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:41,444
Whoa!

1210
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:43,166
Hey!

1211
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,559
Kristoff's home!

1212
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:49,839
- Kristoff's here!
- Kristoff's home!

1213
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:52,319
- Wait, "Kristoff"?
- Uh-huh.

1214
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:53,799
Ah, let me look at you.

1215
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:55,479
Take off your clothes,
I wash them.

1216
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:57,364
No! No, I'm going to
keep my clothes on.

1217
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:58,799
Look, it's great to see you all,

1218
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,039
but where's Granpabbie?

1219
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:01,159
He's napping.

1220
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:02,959
But look, I grew a mushroom.

1221
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,559
- I...
- I earned my fire crystal.

1222
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:06,000
I passed a kidney stone.

1223
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:07,319
Kristoff, pick me up.

1224
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,599
You're getting big.

1225
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:09,881
Good for you.

1226
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,568
Trolls. They're trolls!

1227
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:17,124
He's brought a girl!

1228
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:18,886
A girl!

1229
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:20,759
- Whoa!
- Is that a real girl?

1230
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:22,879
She's like a little cupcake.

1231
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:23,959
What's going on?

1232
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,286
I've learned to just roll with it.

1233
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:27,879
Let me see.
Bright eyes, working nose,

1234
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:29,411
strong teeth!

1235
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:32,279
Yes, yes. She'll do
nicely for our Kristoff.

1236
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:33,519
Wait, wait, wait.
Oh, um, no.

1237
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:34,919
- No.
- You've got the wrong idea.

1238
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:36,079
No. That's not why I
brought her here.

1239
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:37,959
Right. We're not... I'm not...

1240
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:40,159
What's the issue, dear?

1241
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:43,319
Why are you holding back
from such a man?

1242
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:45,329
<i>Is it the clumpy way he walks?</i>

1243
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:47,679
- What?
<i>- Or the grumpy way he talks?</i>

1244
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,479
- Oh, no.
<i>- Or the pear-shaped, square-shaped</i>

1245
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:51,039
<i>Weirdness of his feet?</i>

1246
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:52,159
Hey!

1247
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:54,119
<i>And though we know he washes well</i>

1248
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:56,759
<i>He always ends up sort of smelly</i>

1249
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:58,399
<i>But you'll never meet a fella</i>

1250
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,359
<i>Who's as sensitive and sweet</i>

1251
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:01,479
That's nice, but...

1252
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:03,519
<i>So, he's a bit of a fixer-upper</i>

1253
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,599
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...
<i>- So, he's got a few flaws</i>

1254
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:06,839
<i>Like his peculiar brain, dear</i>

1255
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:07,999
<i>His thing with the reindeer</i>

1256
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,679
<i>That's a little outside
of nature's laws</i>

1257
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:10,799
This is not about me!

1258
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,559
<i>So, he's a bit of a fixer-upper</i>

1259
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:14,759
<i>But this we're certain of</i>

1260
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:17,399
<i>You can fix this fixer-upper up</i>

1261
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,199
<i>- With a little bit of love
- Um...</i>

1262
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,239
Can we please
just stop talking about this?

1263
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:23,479
We've got a real,
actual problem, here.

1264
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:26,081
I'll say. So, tell me, dear...

1265
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,359
<i>Is it the way that he runs scared?</i>

1266
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:30,449
<i>Or that he's socially impaired?</i>

1267
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:33,879
<i>Or that he only likes
To tinkle in the woods?</i>

1268
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:34,999
I did not need to know that.

1269
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,239
<i>Are you holding back your fondness</i>

1270
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:38,719
<i>Due to his unmanly blondness?</i>

1271
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:43,403
<i>Or the way he covers up
That he's the honest goods?</i>

1272
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:46,519
<i>He's just a bit of a fixer-upper</i>

1273
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:48,039
<i>He's got a couple of bugs</i>

1274
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:50,919
- No, I don't!
<i>- His isolation is confirmation</i>

1275
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:53,919
<i>- Of his desperation for healing hugs</i>
- Aw.

1276
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:55,479
<i>So, he's a bit of a fixer-upper</i>

1277
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:58,239
<i>But we know what to do</i>

1278
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:00,279
<i>The way to fix up this fixer-upper</i>

1279
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:01,839
<i>Is to fix him up with you</i>

1280
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:03,519
Whoa!

1281
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,165
Stop it, stop it, stop it!
Enough!

1282
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:08,366
She is engaged to
someone else, okay?

1283
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:14,079
<i>So, she's a bit of a fixer-upper</i>

1284
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:16,009
<i>That's a minor thing</i>

1285
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:18,479
<i>Her quote "engagement"
Is a flex arrangement</i>

1286
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,839
<i>And by the way, I don't see no ring</i>

1287
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:23,119
<i>So, she's a bit of a fixer-upper</i>

1288
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:25,322
- Hey! Whoa, watch it!
<i>- Her brain's a bit betwixt</i>

1289
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,799
<i>Get the fiance out of the way</i>

1290
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:29,121
<i>And the whole thing will be fixed</i>

1291
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,959
<i>We're not saying you can change him</i>

1292
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:36,049
<i>'Cause people don't really change</i>

1293
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:38,679
<i>We're only saying that love's a force</i>

1294
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:41,039
<i>That's powerful and strange</i>

1295
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:43,279
<i>People make bad choices</i>

1296
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:45,687
<i>If they're mad or scared or stressed</i>

1297
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:48,799
<i>But throw a little love their way</i>

1298
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:51,159
<i>Throw a little love their way</i>

1299
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:53,283
<i>And you'll bring out their best</i>

1300
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:55,688
<i>True love brings out the best</i>

1301
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:58,367
<i>Everyone's a bit of a fixer-upper</i>

1302
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:00,319
<i>That's what it's all about</i>

1303
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:01,399
- Father!
- Sister!

1304
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:04,199
<i>- Brother!
- We need each other to raise us up</i>

1305
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,561
<i>And round us out</i>

1306
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,959
<i>Everyone's a bit of a fixer-upper</i>

1307
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:11,479
<i>But when push comes to shove</i>

1308
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:12,759
<i>The only fixer-upper fixer</i>

1309
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:13,839
<i>That can fix a fixer-upper is...</i>

1310
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:17,279
<i>True, true</i>

1311
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:18,399
<i>True</i>

1312
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:19,479
<i>Love!</i>

1313
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:20,839
<i>Love, love, love</i>

1314
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:22,839
<i>Love
True love</i>

1315
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:23,999
<i>True</i>

1316
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,199
Do you, Anna, take Kristoff
to be your trollfully wedded...

1317
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:30,159
- Wait, what?
- You're getting married.

1318
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:31,319
Love!

1319
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:32,601
Anna?

1320
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:34,806
She's as cold as ice.

1321
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:39,170
There is strange magic here.

1322
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:42,563
- Granpabbie.
- Come, come. Bring her here to me.

1323
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:46,725
Anna, your life is in danger.

1324
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:50,324
There is ice in your heart
put there by your sister.

1325
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:55,648
If not removed, to solid ice
will you freeze, forever.

1326
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:57,239
What? No.

1327
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:58,679
But you can remove it, right?

1328
01:08:58,680 --> 01:08:59,879
I cannot

1329
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:01,889
I'm sorry, Kristoff.

1330
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,399
If it was her head,
that would be easy.

1331
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:09,401
But only an act of true love
can thaw a frozen heart.

1332
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,679
An act of true love?

1333
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:14,167
A true love's kiss, perhaps?

1334
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:20,279
- Something's wrong.
- Are you all right?

1335
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:22,879
Anna, we've got to
get you back to Hans.

1336
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:23,999
Hans.

1337
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,201
Pull us out, Sven.

1338
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:29,359
Olaf, come on!

1339
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:31,085
I'm coming!

1340
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:33,363
Let's go kiss Hans!

1341
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:35,484
Who is this Hans?

1342
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:47,489
We are here to find
Princess Anna.

1343
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:51,442
Be on guard, but no harm
is to come to the queen.

1344
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:53,879
Do you understand?

1345
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:55,880
Yes, Your Grace.

1346
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,491
The queen.

1347
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,568
Go, go! Come on!

1348
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:29,887
There!

1349
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:34,567
Up there!

1350
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:36,325
Come on!

1351
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,081
We got her.

1352
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:40,920
No. Please.

1353
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:46,530
Go around. Toss it.

1354
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:48,886
Stay away!

1355
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,326
Look out!

1356
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:52,839
Fire! Fire!

1357
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:54,246
Get her!

1358
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,321
Ah!

1359
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:02,926
Come on!

1360
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:14,007
Grab his arm.

1361
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:18,441
Aim...

1362
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:47,239
This way, this way!

1363
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:48,441
Whoa!

1364
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:51,847
Queen Elsa!

1365
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:54,761
Don't be the monster
they fear you are.

1366
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:44,927
Oh, no. What have...
What have I done?

1367
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:53,491
Why did you bring me here?

1368
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:55,439
I couldn't just let them kill you.

1369
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:58,769
But I'm a danger to Arendelle.
Get Anna.

1370
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:01,199
Anna has not returned.

1371
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:05,048
If you would just stop the winter.

1372
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:07,846
Bring back summer, please.

1373
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:10,645
Don't you see?

1374
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:12,280
I can't.

1375
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:18,281
You have to tell them to let me go.

1376
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:21,889
I will do what I can.

1377
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:46,999
Just hang in there.

1378
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,361
Come on, buddy, faster!

1379
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:55,359
Oh, boy!

1380
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:57,562
Whoa! I'll meet you
guys at the castle!

1381
01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:58,999
Stay out of sight, Olaf.

1382
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,725
I will!

1383
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:04,161
- Hello!
- It's alive!

1384
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:14,725
It's Princess Anna!

1385
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,969
Are you gonna be okay?

1386
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:28,679
Don't worry about me.

1387
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:30,519
Anna!

1388
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:32,439
- You had us worried sick.
- My Lady.

1389
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:35,439
Get her warm. And find
Prince Hans, immediately.

1390
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:37,051
We will. Thank you.

1391
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:38,731
Make sure she's safe.

1392
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:40,679
Oh, you poor girl,
you're freezing.

1393
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:44,089
Oh, let's get you inside now
and get you warm.

1394
01:14:57,480 --> 01:14:59,399
I'm going back out
to look for Princess Anna.

1395
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,250
You cannot risk going
out there again.

1396
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:02,599
If anything happens to her...

1397
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:04,564
If anything happens
to the princess,

1398
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:07,127
you are all Arendelle has left.

1399
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:10,519
He's in here.

1400
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:11,639
Prince Hans.

1401
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:13,079
Anna.

1402
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:14,199
You're so cold.

1403
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:15,439
- Hans, you have to kiss me.
- What?

1404
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:17,159
- Now! Now!
- Slow down.

1405
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:19,089
We'll give you two some privacy.

1406
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:21,039
What happened out there?

1407
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:23,129
Elsa struck me with her powers.

1408
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:24,679
You said she would
never hurt you.

1409
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:25,759
I was wrong.

1410
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:27,325
Anna.

1411
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:31,690
She froze my heart,

1412
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:34,366
and only an act of true
love can save me.

1413
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:37,804
A true love's kiss.

1414
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:49,160
Oh, Anna.

1415
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:53,559
If only there was someone
out there who loved you.

1416
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:55,000
What?

1417
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:00,284
You said you did.

1418
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:04,199
As thirteenth in line in
my own kingdom,

1419
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:05,479
I didn't stand a chance.

1420
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:09,239
I knew I would have to marry
into the throne somewhere.

1421
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:10,805
What... What are you talking about?

1422
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:13,767
As heir, Elsa was
preferable, of course.

1423
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,839
But no one was getting
anywhere with her.

1424
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:16,919
- But you...
- Hans!

1425
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:18,439
You were so desperate for love,

1426
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:21,371
you were willing
to marry me just like that.

1427
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,639
I figured after we married,

1428
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:26,799
I would have to stage
a little accident for Elsa.

1429
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:29,048
- Hans!
- No. Stop.

1430
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:31,159
But then, she doomed herself,

1431
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:33,119
and you were dumb
enough to go after her.

1432
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:34,239
Please.

1433
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:36,920
All that's left now
is to kill Elsa,

1434
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:38,971
and bring back summer.

1435
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:41,439
You're no match for Elsa.

1436
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:43,847
No, you're no match for Elsa.

1437
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:45,681
I, on the other hand,

1438
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:50,729
am the hero who is going to save
Arendelle from destruction.

1439
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:53,011
You won't get away with this.

1440
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:54,607
Oh...

1441
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:56,811
I already have.

1442
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:04,324
Please, somebody, help.

1443
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:10,123
Please. Please.

1444
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:14,999
It's getting colder by the minute.

1445
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,719
If we don't do something soon,
we'll all freeze to death.

1446
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:20,331
Prince Hans.

1447
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,443
Princess Anna is...

1448
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:24,239
Dead.

1449
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:25,319
What?

1450
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:27,010
What happened to her?

1451
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:33,450
She was killed.

1452
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:35,079
By Queen Elsa.

1453
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:36,327
No!

1454
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:37,681
Her own sister.

1455
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:40,967
At least we got to say
our marriage vows

1456
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,282
before she died in my arms.

1457
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:48,730
There can be no doubt now.

1458
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:50,399
Queen Elsa is a monster,

1459
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,523
and we are all in grave danger.

1460
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:53,921
Prince Hans,

1461
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:56,483
Arendelle looks to you.

1462
01:17:57,960 --> 01:17:59,719
With a heavy heart,

1463
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:03,891
I charge Queen Elsa
of Arendelle with treason.

1464
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:06,968
And sentence her to death.

1465
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:20,481
Hurry up!

1466
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:21,639
She's dangerous.

1467
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:23,001
- Move quickly.
- Careful.

1468
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:26,250
- It won't open!
- It's frozen shut.

1469
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:27,686
Put your back into it!

1470
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:29,279
Come on! Push!

1471
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:56,559
What is it, buddy?

1472
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:58,205
Hey, watch it.

1473
01:18:58,560 --> 01:18:59,761
What's wrong with you?

1474
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,282
I don't understand you
when you talk like that.

1475
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:08,079
Stop it! Put me down!

1476
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:11,639
No, Sven!

1477
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:13,239
We're not going back.

1478
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:14,930
She's with her true love.

1479
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:22,921
What the...

1480
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:26,841
Anna!

1481
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:34,685
Come on! Come on, boy.

1482
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:53,881
Help.

1483
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:00,525
Anna!

1484
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:02,680
Oh, no.

1485
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:16,081
Olaf?

1486
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:18,482
Olaf. Get away from there.

1487
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:20,161
Wow!

1488
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:22,919
So, this is heat.

1489
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:24,439
I love it.

1490
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:26,210
Ooh! But don't touch it.

1491
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:37,444
So, where's Hans?
What happened to your kiss?

1492
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:41,806
I was wrong about him.
It wasn't true love.

1493
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:43,725
But we ran all the way here.

1494
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:47,239
Please, Olaf, you can't stay here.
You'll melt.

1495
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:48,359
I am not leaving here until

1496
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:51,131
we find some other act
of true love to save you.

1497
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:53,369
Do you happen to have any ideas?

1498
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:55,410
I don't even know what love is.

1499
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,484
That's okay, I do.

1500
01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:59,285
Love is

1501
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:02,647
putting someone else's
needs before yours.

1502
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:07,211
Like, you know, how Kristoff brought you
back here to Hans and left you forever.

1503
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:12,529
Kristoff loves me?

1504
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:17,607
Wow, you really don't know
anything about love, do you?

1505
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:19,924
Olaf, you're melting.

1506
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:22,402
Some people are
worth melting for.

1507
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:29,642
Just maybe not
right this second.

1508
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:33,286
Don't worry, I've got it.

1509
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:37,923
We're gonna get through... Oh, wait.

1510
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,690
Hang on,
I'm getting something.

1511
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:43,159
It's Kristoff and Sven!

1512
01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:44,566
They're coming back this way.

1513
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,361
They... They are?

1514
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:49,160
Wow! He's really moving fast.

1515
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:50,639
I guess I was wrong.

1516
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:53,207
I guess Kristoff doesn't love you
enough to leave you behind.

1517
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:55,839
Help me up, Olaf. Please.

1518
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:58,999
No, no, no! You need to
stay by the fire and keep warm.

1519
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,759
I need to get to Kristoff.

1520
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:02,041
Why?

1521
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:04,959
Oh, I know why!

1522
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:07,159
There's your act of
true love right there!

1523
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:11,159
Riding across the fjords like a
valiant, pungent reindeer king!

1524
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:12,646
Come on!

1525
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:16,519
Look out!

1526
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:17,960
Oh!

1527
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:26,370
Uh... Back this way.

1528
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:29,250
We're trapped.

1529
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:42,880
Oh...

1530
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:48,410
Whoa!

1531
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:53,130
Slide, Anna!

1532
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:03,571
We made it!

1533
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:06,330
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

1534
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:20,570
Come on, buddy, faster.

1535
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:24,411
Kristoff!

1536
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:31,645
Keep going!

1537
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:35,485
Kristoff!

1538
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:48,167
Come on!

1539
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:03,567
No.

1540
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:19,841
Whoa!

1541
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:29,050
Whoa!

1542
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:32,010
Sven... Sven!

1543
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:43,965
Good boy.

1544
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:56,771
Kristoff.

1545
01:24:57,680 --> 01:24:59,609
- Kristoff...
- Anna...

1546
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:01,601
Anna!

1547
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:08,369
Elsa! You can't run from this!

1548
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:12,639
Just take care of my sister.

1549
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:14,279
Your sister?

1550
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:16,926
She returned from the mountain
weak and cold.

1551
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:19,239
She said that you
froze her heart.

1552
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:20,399
No.

1553
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:22,648
I tried to save her,
but it was too late.

1554
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:26,441
Her skin was ice.
Her hair turned white.

1555
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:29,570
Your sister is dead.

1556
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:31,999
Because of you.

1557
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,247
No.

1558
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:56,521
Kristoff.

1559
01:25:57,760 --> 01:25:59,450
Anna!

1560
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:13,405
Elsa?

1561
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:22,807
No!

1562
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:36,401
Anna!

1563
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,850
Oh. Anna!

1564
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:41,802
No, no!

1565
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:43,445
Please, no.

1566
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:53,201
Anna?

1567
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:35,210
Anna?

1568
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:39,880
Oh, Elsa.

1569
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:42,407
You sacrificed yourself for me?

1570
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:45,519
I love you.

1571
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:50,442
"An act of true love
will thaw a frozen heart."

1572
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:53,690
"Love will thaw."

1573
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:57,439
Love. Of course.

1574
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,721
Elsa?

1575
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:00,441
Love!

1576
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:48,691
I knew you could do it.

1577
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:52,442
Hands down, this is the
best day of my life.

1578
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,759
And, quite possibly, the last.

1579
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:57,281
Oh, Olaf! Hang on, little guy.

1580
01:28:57,560 --> 01:28:59,250
Oh, Oh, Oh!

1581
01:29:01,160 --> 01:29:04,443
My own personal flurry!

1582
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:10,770
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

1583
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:14,841
Anna?

1584
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:16,844
But she froze your heart.

1585
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:19,771
The only frozen heart
around here is yours.

1586
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:26,724
Wonderful!

1587
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:41,205
Setting course, sir.

1588
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:46,839
I will return this
scoundrel to his country.

1589
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:50,761
We shall see what his 12 big
brothers think of his behavior.

1590
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:52,479
Arendelle thanks you, milord.

1591
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:54,319
This is unacceptable.

1592
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:57,479
I am a victim of fear.
I've been traumatized.

1593
01:29:57,480 --> 01:29:59,364
Ah! My neck hurts.

1594
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:03,039
Is there a doctor that I could see?

1595
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:05,439
And I demand to see the queen!

1596
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:07,642
Oh. I have a message
from the queen.

1597
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:09,919
"Arendelle will henceforth
and forever

1598
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:14,045
"no longer do business of
any sort with Weaseltown."

1599
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:15,239
"Weselton."

1600
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:16,799
- It's Weselton!
- Let's go.

1601
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:17,919
Come on, come on, come on!

1602
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,399
Okay, okay, here I come.

1603
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:22,489
- Pole!
- Whoops! Sorry.

1604
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:24,211
Okay, Okay.

1605
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:26,044
Here we are. Oh!

1606
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:30,363
I owe you a sled.

1607
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:35,204
- Are you serious?
- Yes!

1608
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:36,999
And it's the latest model.

1609
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,599
No, I can't accept this.

1610
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:41,565
You have to. No returns.
No exchanges. Queen's orders.

1611
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:45,521
She's named you the Official
Arendelle Ice Master and Deliverer.

1612
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:47,519
- What? That's not a thing.
- Oh, sure it is.

1613
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:51,039
And it even has a cup holder.
Do you like it?

1614
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:53,359
Like it? I love it!

1615
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:54,439
Whoa.

1616
01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:56,290
I could kiss you!

1617
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,879
I could. I mean,
I'd like to. I'd...

1618
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:01,079
May I? We me.
I mean, may we?

1619
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:02,327
Wait, what?

1620
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:04,566
We may.

1621
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:07,889
Mmm.

1622
01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:09,926
Summer!

1623
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:13,799
Ooh...

1624
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:15,879
Hello.

1625
01:31:32,160 --> 01:31:33,239
Are you ready?

1626
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:41,282
Ice!

1627
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:53,479
Ooh! Whoo-hoo...

1628
01:31:53,480 --> 01:31:55,125
Swing me.

1629
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:57,804
Ooh...

1630
01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:59,759
I like the open gates.

1631
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:02,122
We are never closing them again.

1632
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:07,127
Oh, Elsa, they're beautiful,
but you know I don't skate.

1633
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:08,731
Come on! You can do it!

1634
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:11,359
Look out.
Reindeer coming through.

1635
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:13,119
I got it, I got it.
