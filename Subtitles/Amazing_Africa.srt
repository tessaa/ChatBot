00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:55,685
<i>NARRATOR'. Africa.</i>

2
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:58,642
<i>This great, sprawling wilderness</i>

3
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:03,231
<i>is home to some of the planet's rarest
and most fascinating animals.</i>

4
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,865
<i>Some of these species are peaceful
and live closely with one another,</i>

5
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:11,993
<i>while others are aggressive
and frightening predators</i>

6
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:15,702
<i>who strike fear into the hearts
of the continent's wildlife.</i>

7
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:19,000
<i>We're going to follow
some of these incredible animals</i>

8
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,752
<i>and see how they survive</i>

9
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:23,960
<i>in this sometimes barren
and unforgiving landscape.</i>

10
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:27,296
<i>We will also witness
the hardships they encounter</i>

11
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:29,222
<i>and the relationships they build.</i>

12
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:32,805
<i>Some animals here
have learned to adapt to survive</i>

13
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:35,103
<i>in strange and unusual ways.</i>

14
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:39,817
<i>Others have to make great migrations
across the continent</i>

15
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:41,643
<i>in search of food and water.</i>

16
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:46,862
<i>Certain species build close
family bonds which last a lifetime,</i>

17
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,240
<i>utilising teamwork
and companionship to survive.</i>

18
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:55,533
<i>But others survive using aggression,
power and instinct.</i>

19
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:59,043
<i>Some survive simply
by taking what they can.</i>

20
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:03,002
<i>This is an ecosystem
of diversity and contrast</i>

21
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:06,426
<i>which supports
some truly amazing characters.</i>

22
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:10,590
<i>The challenges which this landscape
presents to some animals</i>

23
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:14,176
<i>has led to many astonishing
evolutionary adaptations</i>

24
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,682
<i>and highly specialised behaviour.</i>

25
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,477
<i>Land like this, known as savanna,</i>

26
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,683
<i>covers 20% of the globe.</i>

27
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:25,862
<i>Yet it is a land type
we know surprisingly little about.</i>

28
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:41,587
<i>Water, the supporter of life
and the habitat for many of Africa's animals.</i>

29
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:46,008
<i>But possibly the most surprising
thing about Africa</i>

30
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,170
<i>is the incredible struggles
these animals have to endure</i>

31
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:51,346
<i>to reach water and stay alive.</i>

32
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:55,392
<i>Dozens of different species
embark on continuous,</i>

33
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:57,686
<i>arduous journeys around the savanna,</i>

34
00:02:57,928 --> 00:03:02,308
<i>travelling from water source to water source
simply to survive.</i>

35
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:06,399
<i>Nowhere on the globe is such
a massive journey embarked on</i>

36
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,984
<i>by such a vast amount of animals.</i>

37
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:13,194
<i>And nowhere on Earth
is the migration more dangerous.</i>

38
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:16,371
<i>With predators around every corner,</i>

39
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:20,493
<i>and danger even lurking in the one thing
that keeps them alive,</i>

40
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:24,834
<i>it is no wonder that so many animals
perish along the way.</i>

41
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:42,272
<i>To put this great migration into context,</i>

42
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:47,111
<i>let's look at a typical migration pattern
of the wildebeests over one year.</i>

43
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:51,402
<i>Travelling great distances
for months on end,</i>

44
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:55,369
<i>these animals continually circle
the Serengeti National Park.</i>

45
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,534
<i>Moving to and from each water source.</i>

46
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,579
<i>They have to continually keep travelling.</i>

47
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,754
<i>In a way, these animals
act as nature's calendar,</i>

48
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,127
<i>turning up at a different spot each month.</i>

49
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:18,221
<i>So these wildebeests truly are
nature's greatest travellers.</i>

50
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:33,524
<i>But when these great travellers
are joined by the zebras,</i>

51
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:37,657
<i>they become one of the most
impressive sights ever seen in nature.</i>

52
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:58,890
<i>But along the way the wildebeests pass
different African animals, like the hippos.</i>

53
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,058
<i>Although they may look peaceful,</i>

54
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:08,313
<i>hippos are one of Africa's most aggressive
and unpredictable animals.</i>

55
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:14,114
<i>The yawn they often display
is actually a form of intimidation.</i>

56
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:20,863
<i>Hippos like to group together in pods
which can contain up to 100 hippos.</i>

57
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:24,666
<i>These pods are usually led
by one dominant male.</i>

58
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,829
<i>A fully grown adult
can weigh up to three tons</i>

59
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:31,707
<i>and can run up to 18 miles per hour.</i>

60
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:38,134
<i>An adult hippopotamus can hold its breath
for up to 20 minutes,</i>

61
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:42,889
<i>swimming or walking along the riverbed
in order to avoid danger.</i>

62
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:52,478
<i>The name "hippopotamus",
or "hippo" for short,</i>

63
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:56,862
<i>is derived from
the ancient Greek for "river horse".</i>

64
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,659
<i>Hippos spend a lot of time in the water,</i>

65
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:04,205
<i>but also can spend months on end
out of the water, in the bush.</i>

66
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:13,090
<i>After passing most of their day
in or around water,</i>

67
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:17,503
<i>these hippos will move inland at night
to graze on short grass.</i>

68
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:26,971
<i>To most animals
this ferociously flowing river</i>

69
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,600
<i>would be incredibly dangerous,</i>

70
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:31,688
<i>but hippos are completely at home here.</i>

71
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:36,981
(BIRDS CHIRPING)

72
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,949
<i>From water to land</i>

73
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:44,371
<i>here in Africa we can find some of
the most fascinating animals of our planet,</i>

74
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:45,614
<i>like the leopard.</i>

75
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,576
<i>Leopards are mysterious
and graceful creatures,</i>

76
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,916
<i>and live most of their lives alone.</i>

77
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:57,001
<i>She likes to hunt at night to stay hidden
and to avoid the heat of the day.</i>

78
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:01,718
<i>The leopard stalks her territory
slowly and stealthily,</i>

79
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:04,258
<i>using her patterned fur for camouflage</i>

80
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:08,432
<i>so she can get as close
to a prey as possible before pouncing.</i>

81
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:13,479
<i>Let's follow her for a while as she
searches for her dinner in the undergrowth.</i>

82
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:51,100
<i>These unsuspecting birds haven't realised
that the leopard is watching them.</i>

83
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:53,940
<i>She is too tired to hunt them
in the heat of the day.</i>

84
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:55,859
<i>She prefers to rest.</i>

85
00:07:56,351 --> 00:08:00,652
<i>So, these helmeted guinea fowl
can wander further into the savanna</i>

86
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,903
<i>and pay a visit to the zebra family.</i>

87
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,119
<i>The zebra spends most of her day grazing.</i>

88
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:10,867
<i>She may look lonely here
but she is in fact part of a big group.</i>

89
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,589
<i>Here are the zebra's family and friends.</i>

90
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,000
<i>They like to stay together</i>

91
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,757
<i>because unlike the crocodile
and the leopard,</i>

92
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,754
<i>they are very vulnerable.</i>

93
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:31,015
<i>Like many animals living on the savanna,</i>

94
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:34,351
<i>zebras are very dependent
on water and grass</i>

95
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,770
<i>and spend a lot of their time migrating</i>

96
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:40,320
<i>to make sure they are always
near a source of quality food.</i>

97
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:46,569
<i>They're at their happiest when they have
a good place to cool off and have a drink,</i>

98
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:52,491
<i>but they often forget that crocodiles
are always vigilantly watching them.</i>

99
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,680
<i>Zebras are closely related to horses.</i>

100
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:13,729
<i>They are large single-hoofed ungulates,
built for speed and long-distance migrations.</i>

101
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:18,768
<i>Zebras typically stand about
47 to 55 inches at the shoulder.</i>

102
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:45,719
<i>This black rhino is still roaming
the plains alone, in search of drinking water.</i>

103
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:52,093
<i>Even though he is well adapted
to dry conditions,</i>

104
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,727
<i>he needs to find some water soon.</i>

105
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:06,444
<i>His sharp horns may look scary,
but he is in fact an herbivore</i>

106
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:10,986
<i>grazing on twigs, branches
and other plant life instead of eating meat.</i>

107
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:16,829
<i>Rhinos are only aggressive
if they are disturbed.</i>

108
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:20,170
<i>But they have been killed
by humans for centuries</i>

109
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:22,334
<i>as their horns are very valuable.</i>

110
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:27,302
<i>This makes them one of
the most endangered species on the planet.</i>

111
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,474
<i>Another herbivore
who calls the savanna home</i>

112
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,726
<i>is the gravity-defying giraffe.</i>

113
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:44,694
<i>Giraffes are the tallest
living mammals on Earth,</i>

114
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,772
<i>growing to a whopping height of 20 feet.</i>

115
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:57,742
<i>Although giraffes tend to spend a lot
of their time in groups,</i>

116
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,877
<i>they don't actually have
much of a bond with other giraffes.</i>

117
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:11,963
<i>Here we see a giraffe
grazing on the leaves of an acacia.</i>

118
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,761
<i>Her neck alone is two metres long</i>

119
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:17,136
<i>and has evolved over millions of years</i>

120
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,184
<i>so that she can reach
the leaves on the tallest trees.</i>

121
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:26,479
<i>The giraffe's large, bulging eyes
give it a wide, panoramic field of vision,</i>

122
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:29,231
<i>making them good at spotting predators.</i>

123
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:34,494
<i>As well as their incredibly long necks,
giraffes also have tongues</i>

124
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:37,539
<i>which can grow to 50 centimetres in length.</i>

125
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:39,908
<i>Like a human's fingerprint,</i>

126
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:43,336
<i>each giraffe has its own
individual fur pattern.</i>

127
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:47,749
<i>These complex patterns
give the giraffe camouflage</i>

128
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,255
<i>making them harder for predators to see.</i>

129
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:57,513
<i>As you can see there is no shortage
of food in this</i> area.

130
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:02,856
<i>And this is fortunate for her and her family,
because giraffes need to eat a lot</i>

131
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:06,026
<i>and graze not only on the leaves,
but also twigs</i>

132
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,024
<i>because they contain
more calcium and protein</i>

133
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,903
<i>which giraffes need to
sustain their rate of growth.</i>

134
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:16,703
<i>She also likes to eat grass, shrubs and fruit.</i>

135
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:20,619
<i>In all, giraffes are hungry animals,</i>

136
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:24,703
<i>eating around 34 kilograms
of foliage every day.</i>

137
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:36,181
<i>Giraffes digest leaves and the other foliage
they eat in a similar way to cows.</i>

138
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:41,220
<i>They like to chew the food up,
swallow it to help partially digest it</i>

139
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,601
<i>before passing it back into the mouth
for more chewing.</i>

140
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:56,117
<i>To satisfy their massive appetite,</i>

141
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:59,280
<i>the family are moving on
to the next set of trees.</i>

142
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:06,203
<i>But there are more great animals
to explore in Africa.</i>

143
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:14,302
<i>Here we see a new addition
to an elephant herd.</i>

144
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,764
<i>This young elephant is about two weeks old.</i>

145
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:26,189
<i>Like zebra foals, baby elephants are able
to stand and walk almost immediately.</i>

146
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,189
<i>This is to give them a better chance
against predators</i>

147
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:33,238
<i>and because elephants
tend to travel large distances,</i>

148
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:36,362
<i>so this youngster won't hold
the herd up too much.</i>

149
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:41,488
<i>The alloparents guide their young charges
to the next watering hole.</i>

150
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,201
<i>Elephants are highly dependent on water</i>

151
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:50,915
<i>and most of their lives are spent either
at a watering hole, or in search of another.</i>

152
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:55,468
<i>In addition, elephants cool themselves down
by flapping their ears.</i>

153
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:03,302
<i>Because it is so hot in the savanna,
elephants have developed large ear surfaces.</i>

154
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,641
<i>Let's join them taking their morning bath.</i>

155
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:16,026
<i>The long-living elephants have large brains
and are highly intelligent,</i>

156
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:19,571
<i>hence the expression
"An elephant never forgets".</i>

157
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:23,780
<i>The lives of male and female elephants
are very different.</i>

158
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:28,452
<i>The females form strong bonds with
one another and nurture their offspring,</i>

159
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:32,255
<i>while the males tend to
spend their time independently.</i>

160
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:36,547
<i>Sometimes they even leave their group
and join another group of elephants.</i>

161
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:41,173
<i>This elephant has left the water with a nice
coating of mud on her neck.</i>

162
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:44,267
<i>She knows that mud protects her
from the sun</i>

163
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:46,470
<i>and also acts as an insect repellent.</i>

164
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:54,945
<i>As the day wears on,
in the long grass of the savanna</i>

165
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,647
<i>different species move uninterrupted.</i>

166
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:02,953
<i>Here we see a cheetah,
one of the fastest animals in the world.</i>

167
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:08,291
<i>Cheetahs can reach speeds
of up to 75 miles per hour.</i>

168
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:22,097
<i>This cheetah spends most of her day resting
and sheltering from the hot African sun.</i>

169
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:31,724
<i>But unlike most cats of Africa,
she prefers to hunt in the daytime, too.</i>

170
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:41,734
<i>As you can see, the cheetah
is an animal built for speed.</i>

171
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:45,987
<i>She has a long, slender body,</i>

172
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:49,244
<i>which is extremely light
for an animal of her size.</i>

173
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,249
<i>She also has long legs, a flexible spine</i>

174
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:59,422
<i>and a very long tail to help her balance
as she is chasing her prey.</i>

175
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:17,193
<i>Witnessing a sunrise on the savanna</i>

176
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:20,272
<i>must be one of the most
glorious spectacles on Earth.</i>

177
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:24,530
<i>As the sunlight creeps
across the grasslands,</i>

178
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:29,911
<i>we become aware of all the wildlife
awakening to another exciting day.</i>

179
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:33,201
<i>One animal is always up early,</i>

180
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:36,625
<i>it's the spotted hyena in the search for food.</i>

181
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:45,092
<i>Most people think hyenas
are only scavengers,</i>

182
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:48,425
<i>who feed on the remains of animals
killed by other predators</i>

183
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,761
<i>such as the cheetah or the leopard.</i>

184
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:54,723
<i>However we have recently found out
that spotted hyenas</i>

185
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:59,686
<i>actually kill as much as 95%
of the food they eat themselves.</i>

186
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,906
<i>Hyenas can be quite ferocious animals</i>

187
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:10,830
<i>and have been known to fight off leopards
and sometimes even lionesses</i>

188
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:12,999
<i>in order to protect their food.</i>

189
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:16,794
<i>Hyenas have even been known
to attack humans.</i>

190
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:23,334
<i>- These are spotted hyena.
-(SNARLING)</i>

191
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,258
<i>They are the most sociable
of the hyena species</i>

192
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:28,465
<i>and also the best hunters.</i>

193
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:32,310
<i>Spotted hyenas
can weigh up to 75 kilograms,</i>

194
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:35,226
<i>certainly making them
a force to be reckoned with.</i>

195
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:44,989
<i>This romantic landscape
appears peaceful and quiet.</i>

196
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:47,283
<i>But this is deceiving,</i>

197
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:52,872
<i>because this lioness
is watching out for suitable prey.</i>

198
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:58,329
<i>What she doesn't know
is that her perfect meal is just over the hill.</i>

199
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:04,167
<i>These African buffalo are quite slow
and not very intelligent,</i>

200
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:08,339
<i>meaning they can be easily hunted
by predators like lions.</i>

201
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:14,011
<i>All the wildlife at this waterhole
are taking advantage of the cooling mud,</i>

202
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:18,226
<i>oblivious to all the dangers
lurking in the surrounding savanna.</i>

203
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:23,812
<i>Finally, the lion spots the buffalo
as they move away from the waterhole.</i>

204
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,233
<i>The buffalo slowly proceed on their way,</i>

205
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,745
<i>but one or two of them seem nervous.</i>

206
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,448
<i>They might sense
something is watching them.</i>

207
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:45,801
<i>African buffalo have what is called
a symbiotic relationship with small birds.</i>

208
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:50,138
<i>The buffalo offers food for the birds
in the form of bugs,</i>

209
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:52,719
<i>while receiving a cleaning service.</i>

210
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:06,521
<i>Suddenly, the lion and her sister
spring into action</i>

211
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:09,320
<i>and give chase to the large herd of buffalo.</i>

212
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:14,696
<i>The buffalo could probably
overcome the lions if they would co-operate.</i>

213
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:18,074
<i>This time, though, they escape.</i>

214
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:30,466
<i>Lions are very sociable animals
and live together in prides.</i>

215
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:35,721
<i>Apart from hunting and grooming each other,
they spend a lot of the day resting.</i>

216
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,725
<i>This is mostly to conserve energy
and in order to stay hidden.</i>

217
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:47,737
<i>Lions grow up together and form
extremely close family and friendship bonds.</i>

218
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:49,439
(BOTH GROWLING)

219
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:56,033
<i>Today, the sisters failed to bring
any food back to the pride.</i>

220
00:19:56,654 --> 00:20:00,204
<i>So this lion might have to wait
a long time for his next meal.</i>

221
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:19,348
<i>But Africa has
more fascinating animals to offer,</i>

222
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,512
<i>like these baboons.</i>

223
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:27,898
<i>These chacmas baboons like to roam
around the savanna in groups</i>

224
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:29,737
<i>foraging for food.</i>

225
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,617
<i>With these baboons,
the social standing of a member</i>

226
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:38,492
<i>plays a large part in foraging decisions.</i>

227
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:42,329
<i>The most dominant members,
usually alpha males,</i>

228
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:46,913
<i>lead the rest of group and decide about
where to go in order to find food.</i>

229
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:51,167
<i>This youngster is enjoying a free ride
on his mother's back.</i>

230
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,215
(SHRIEKING)

231
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,444
<i>Once these baboons arrive at a good site,</i>

232
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:21,163
<i>they will display
collective foraging behaviour</i>

233
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:24,412
<i>in order to eat similar amounts
of food as each other.</i>

234
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:32,425
<i>Chacmas baboons
live in large social groups called troops.</i>

235
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:35,670
<i>Within a troop, male and female baboons</i>

236
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:38,552
<i>might form what are
referred to as "friendships".</i>

237
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:47,565
<i>Let's observe these little baboons
interacting with each other</i>

238
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,142
<i>climbing on an old tree,</i>

239
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,234
<i>like children at a playground.</i>

240
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:08,203
<i>Blissfully unaware in their innocent play
the monkeys are almost able to forget</i>

241
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:12,875
<i>that in the savanna there is
always something eerily watching you.</i>

242
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:20,465
<i>This ominous circling of birds
can mean only one thing.</i>

243
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:22,428
<i>- There has been</i> a <i>kill.
-(SCREAMING)</i>

244
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:31,651
<i>These opportunistic scavengers
have swarmed to the site of a kill</i>

245
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:34,148
<i>to try and steal some free food.</i>

246
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:38,862
<i>The victim is the African buffalo
which was killed by the hyenas.</i>

247
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:43,408
<i>This gruesome and bloody sight
is common in the wilds of Africa.</i>

248
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,712
<i>Scavenger birds like the marabou</i>

249
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,666
<i>and vultures congregate
at the top of this tree,</i>

250
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:57,093
<i>waiting their turn to grab some meat.</i>

251
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:03,258
<i>These marabou are primarily wading birds,
but are never ones to turn down a free meal.</i>

252
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:07,971
<i>Scavenging takes far less effort
and expends far less energy,</i>

253
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:11,432
<i>so most animals will take
the opportunity if it arises.</i>

254
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:23,528
<i>This hyena tries his best
to fend the vultures off,</i>

255
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,704
<i>knowing they will quickly eat his food.</i>

256
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,491
<i>The vultures are persistent though.</i>

257
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:32,291
<i>It'll take more than that
to scare them away from a meal.</i>

258
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:37,216
<i>The vultures' determination
eventually pays off</i>

259
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:41,467
<i>and while the hyenas are busy tucking in,
the vultures make their move</i>

260
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,218
<i>and swarm on the carcass.</i>

261
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:49,979
<i>Although the marabous
are taller than the vultures,</i>

262
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:52,898
<i>they can't match them in terms of
aggression and forcefulness</i>

263
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:55,731
<i>and are forced to watch from the sidelines.</i>

264
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:16,338
<i>The savanna is quiet
in the baking afternoon sun.</i>

265
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,585
<i>The wildebeests are still migrating.</i>

266
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,174
<i>These are blue wildebeests</i>

267
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:26,048
<i>and they are making the long,
exhausting migration</i>

268
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:31,604
<i>across land during the dry season
in order to find fresh grass for feeding.</i>

269
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:39,566
<i>During this migration wildebeests can be
very vulnerable to predators</i>

270
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:45,118
<i>such as leopards, cheetahs, spotted hyenas,
and the wily Nile crocodile.</i>

271
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:50,781
<i>Wildebeests tend to
group together in large herds</i>

272
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:54,038
<i>when the chances of being
attacked by a predator are high.</i>

273
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,460
<i>This herd is already spotted
by a leopard high in the trees.</i>

274
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:05,679
<i>It has noticed that one of the wildebeests
has an injured leg.</i>

275
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:10,093
<i>This will make it far easier
for her to catch and kill the animal.</i>

276
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:14,768
<i>Her demeanour changes
almost instantly from that of a lazy cat</i>

277
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,979
<i>to that of a highly motivated
and skilled killer.</i>

278
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:28,653
<i>She quickly climbs down from her
lookout post and into the undergrowth.</i>

279
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:35,330
<i>The leopard moves swiftly and efficiently,
treading gently to avoid making noise.</i>

280
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:44,172
<i>She is keeping a low profile to avoid
any attention from the wildebeests.</i>

281
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:49,511
<i>The vultures know what is about to happen
and amass in the hope of a free meal.</i>

282
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:54,804
<i>She makes sure to stay in the long grass,</i>

283
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:57,811
<i>using her camouflaged fur
to maximum effect.</i>

284
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:02,812
<i>She pounces instantly and goes straight
for the wildebeest's neck.</i>

285
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:06,107
<i>Her jaws clamp shut
around the wildebeest's windpipe</i>

286
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,113
<i>in order to suffocate the animal.</i>

287
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:18,286
<i>The vultures have watched
the entire violent episode</i>

288
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:20,712
<i>and know that a meal is well on its way.</i>

289
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:26,048
<i>The leopard finishes the hunt by carrying
the wildebeest into the long grass</i>

290
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:28,470
<i>to hide it from scavengers
and other predators.</i>

291
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:31,132
<i>Leopards like to store their kills away</i>

292
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:33,843
<i>so that they can eat them
over an extended period.</i>

293
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:36,971
<i>Sometimes they will have
several stored at once</i>

294
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:38,980
<i>and will feed between them.</i>

295
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,569
<i>Leopards have to make sure
that these carcasses</i>

296
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:50,652
<i>are extremely well hidden,
or as we've just seen,</i>

297
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:53,237
<i>there are countless scavengers
in this habitat</i>

298
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:56,498
<i>hungry and willing
to eat anything they can find.</i>

299
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:18,221
<i>The elephants have been forced
to move on from the water hole</i>

300
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,226
<i>to the barren and dry plains</i>

301
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:23,809
<i>in order to graze on grass
and other vegetative matter.</i>

302
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:25,986
<i>An adult African elephant</i>

303
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:30,612
<i>eats between 100 and 150 kilograms
of food every day</i>

304
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:33,778
<i>and spends around three quarters of its time,</i>

305
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,904
<i>day and night, eating.</i>

306
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,159
<i>This one uses her trunk
which is incredibly dexterous</i>

307
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:41,744
<i>to pull grass from the ground
and into her mouth.</i>

308
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:46,503
<i>- Elephants' tusks serve multiple purposes.
-(TRUMPETING)</i>

309
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:50,132
<i>These include digging,
debarking or marking trees,</i>

310
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,633
<i>clearing branches and foliage,</i>

311
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:56,892
<i>and when these peaceful giants
are forced to fight to protect their family,</i>

312
00:27:57,217 --> 00:28:00,266
<i>the tusks become
a highly dangerous weapon.</i>

313
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:04,107
<i>Elephants have great control
over their trunks.</i>

314
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:08,813
<i>This powerful tool also enables the elephant
to breathe when in water,</i>

315
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:11,983
<i>to produce its well known
loud trumpeting sound</i>

316
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:14,618
<i>and to have an acute sense of touch.</i>

317
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:19,206
<i>But the most vital sense for elephants
is their sense of smell.</i>

318
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:22,076
<i>It is estimated that the elephants
sense of smell</i>

319
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:24,829
<i>is four times as sensitive as a bloodhound's.</i>

320
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:30,338
<i>The dry season can be particularly
punishing on the African plains</i>

321
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:34,130
<i>and many animals die from dehydration
or lack of food.</i>

322
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:37,342
<i>That's why migration
is their only hope to survive.</i>

323
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:45,812
<i>The wildebeests have finally
completed their long migration</i>

324
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:47,609
<i>in search of fresh grazing.</i>

325
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:51,488
<i>They've found a suitable watering hole
which they can drink from</i>

326
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:53,445
<i>after the long, dry walk.</i>

327
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:05,791
<i>The extraordinary, annual great migration
of wildebeests</i>

328
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:08,463
<i>is one of the
Seven New Wonders of the World.</i>

329
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:13,089
<i>Nowhere else is a movement of animals
as immense as the wildebeest's journey.</i>

330
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:22,637
<i>Wildebeests have evolved
so that their migration is timed to coincide</i>

331
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:25,518
<i>with the annual pattern
of rainfall and grass growth.</i>

332
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:30,729
<i>This way, wildebeests are staying
close to water supplies at all times.</i>

333
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,743
<i>While the wildebeests
are quenching their thirst,</i>

334
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:49,296
<i>this zebra is bonding with
the other zebras in her herd.</i>

335
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:52,837
<i>Alliances are valuable
in this harsh environment.</i>

336
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:59,090
<i>Because they are regularly thirsty,
zebras simply have no choice</i>

337
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:02,764
<i>and constantly have to face lurking dangers
such as crocodiles.</i>

338
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:07,268
<i>This crocodile stays low in the water
so that it isn't seen.</i>

339
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:10,688
<i>But this time it is spotted by the zebras</i>

340
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,986
<i>and the tribe manage to
escape with their lives.</i>

341
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:24,832
<i>One of the zebras was just
giving birth to a new life.</i>

342
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:29,791
<i>Female zebras, or mares, mature more
quickly than their male counterparts.</i>

343
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,966
<i>They are able to reproduce at as early
as three years old,</i>

344
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:38,713
<i>whilst males are not strong enough
to breed until they are around five or six.</i>

345
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,595
<i>Like horses, zebra foals are able to stand,</i>

346
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,928
<i>and walk slightly
almost immediately after birth.</i>

347
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:50,107
<i>This is an evolutionary development
to make them less vulnerable to predators.</i>

348
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:55,479
<i>Foals are born with brown and white stripes,
but these darken as they mature.</i>

349
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,324
<i>The foal is born connected to the placenta,</i>

350
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:03,324
<i>which the mother sometimes eats
after birth because it is rich in nutrients</i>

351
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:06,661
<i>and salt which the mother needs
after the strains of labour.</i>

352
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:11,670
<i>The placenta can also serve
as a nutritious treat for other animals.</i>

353
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:17,509
<i>These tawny eagles are
the first to notice this discarded organ.</i>

354
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:21,047
<i>But it's not long before
other birds get in on the act.</i>

355
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:23,386
<i>This vulture is larger than the eagles</i>

356
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:26,014
<i>and he always gets first pick
when it comes to food.</i>

357
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:27,519
(SCREAMING)

358
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:29,346
<i>Suddenly a feeding frenzy erupts</i>

359
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:33,359
<i>as more and more birds try and get
a piece of the free lunch on offer.</i>

360
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:48,370
<i>The eagles, who were first on the scene,
are forced to watch from the sidelines</i>

361
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,325
<i>as the vultures get their fill.</i>

362
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,645
<i>The foal huddles close to her mother.</i>

363
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:20,652
<i>These desperate, ruthless vultures are her
first experience of life on the African plains.</i>

364
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,488
<i>The zebras stay close to the foal,</i>

365
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:26,446
<i>instinctively protecting
the newest member of the herd</i>

366
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:30,954
<i>who will eventually understand her role
in the hierarchy of the local wildlife.</i>

367
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:35,666
<i>Let's discover what the new foal sees
in her first few moments of life.</i>

368
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:48,266
<i>Mother and daughter
take their first walk together.</i>

369
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:53,097
<i>The foal's walking abilities
so early on in life are quite incredible.</i>

370
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:57,643
<i>The mother takes her daughter
to the watering hole.</i>

371
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:01,856
<i>She is in desperate need of a drink
after the exhaustive effort of giving birth.</i>

372
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:10,080
<i>No animal has a more distinctive coat
than the zebra,</i>

373
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:12,453
<i>no two zebras are exactly alike.</i>

374
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,206
<i>There are a number of different theories</i>

375
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:18,960
<i>which attempt to explain the reason
for their eye-catching stripy coat.</i>

376
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:25,470
<i>Because of their uniqueness, stripes may
help zebras recognise one another.</i>

377
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:29,387
<i>The pattern may also make it difficult
for predators to identify</i>

378
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:33,312
<i>a single animal from a running herd
and distort distance at midday.</i>

379
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:43,196
<i>For an even safer journey,
zebras often join large herds of wildebeests.</i>

380
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:51,989
<i>This giant herd of wildebeests
is thousands strong,</i>

381
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:55,542
<i>covering the entire plain
as far as the horizon.</i>

382
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:59,709
<i>The calving season is well
on the way on the savanna.</i>

383
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,799
<i>Many animals now have young offspring.</i>

384
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:07,671
<i>The wildebeests are again on the move,
looking for the next source of water.</i>

385
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:25,694
<i>Even when they rest, cheetahs are
always on the lookout for potential prey.</i>

386
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:29,033
<i>The young cats pant to try and keep cool.</i>

387
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:34,661
<i>These young cheetahs are still living with,
and learning from, their mothers.</i>

388
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,119
<i>Their mother will bring injured prey
back to her young</i>

389
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:40,374
<i>to teach them hunting and killing skills</i>

390
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:43,248
<i>until she thinks they are ready
to brave the world alone.</i>

391
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:47,511
<i>After about 18 months
the mother will leave the cheetah cubs,</i>

392
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:50,301
<i>who will form a group known as a sib.</i>

393
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:54,134
<i>Two years later the female siblings
will leave the group</i>

394
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:58,563
<i>and the males will remain together,
sometimes throughout adulthood.</i>

395
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:09,275
<i>It is hard to imagine these furry cubs
will be agile killing machines</i>

396
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:10,904
<i>just two years from now.</i>

397
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:18,829
<i>With her young family to feed
she is constantly on the lookout for prey.</i>

398
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:24,294
<i>She's not, however, sure about
taking on the might of a wildebeest.</i>

399
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:28,009
<i>Instead, she spots
a Thomson's gazelle with her fawn.</i>

400
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:31,922
<i>Gazelles are one of
the cheetah's favourite meals.</i>

401
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:36,264
<i>The cheetah knows
that this encounter may well result in a kill</i>

402
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:39,438
<i>so she takes her cubs with her
to teach them how it's done.</i>

403
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,520
<i>Gazelles are extremely athletic animals</i>

404
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:49,982
<i>and can run at speeds up to
62 miles per hour.</i>

405
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:53,744
<i>This means normally
they have a fair chance against cheetahs</i>

406
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:56,037
<i>and escape around 50% of the time.</i>

407
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,783
<i>However, a springbok with a fawn</i>

408
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:04,167
<i>is far more vulnerable as the fawn cannot run
anywhere near as fast as her mother.</i>

409
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:09,255
<i>The cheetah has seen that the fawn has been
separated from her mother</i>

410
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:12,508
<i>and so chooses this moment
to launch her rapid attack.</i>

411
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:18,560
<i>Her incredible speed is clear to see
and she quickly catches up with the gazelle.</i>

412
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:21,146
<i>The gazelle weaves and dodges,</i>

413
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:23,349
<i>but the cheetah
is more than equal to the challenge,</i>

414
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,564
<i>using her great balance and reactions</i>

415
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:30,614
<i>to weave with the gazelle
before finally catching her.</i>

416
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,817
<i>This was barely a challenge for the cheetah,</i>

417
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:36,611
<i>but animals here will take any food they can.</i>

418
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:40,457
<i>It will also serve as a
valuable lesson for her cubs.</i>

419
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:45,671
<i>These growing cheetahs will have to absorb
many lessons from their mother</i>

420
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:48,498
<i>before trying to bring down
an animal on their own.</i>

421
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:56,841
<i>Cheetah cubs at this stage in their lives
have almost insatiable appetites</i>

422
00:36:56,965 --> 00:37:00,595
<i>as they need a lot of protein,
fat and calcium to grow.</i>

423
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,978
<i>They have to eat their prey
as quickly as possible,</i>

424
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:13,440
<i>not because of small scavengers
like vultures and marabou,</i>

425
00:37:13,857 --> 00:37:17,737
<i>but because of other larger predators,
such as lions, who are nearby.</i>

426
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:30,674
<i>But here they are all together
able to enjoy their family meal in peace.</i>

427
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:46,143
<i>The mother is careful to ensure</i>

428
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:49,271
<i>that the young cheetahs
gorge themselves on the prey,</i>

429
00:37:49,476 --> 00:37:52,776
<i>as they may not get another meal
for a very long time.</i>

430
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:08,332
<i>Africa has more to offer.</i>

431
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,504
<i>Warthogs are also
very common in the Masai Mara.</i>

432
00:38:15,335 --> 00:38:18,009
<i>This warthog is a member of the pig family.</i>

433
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:23,351
<i>They aren't particularly territorial animals
but instead occupy what is known</i>

434
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:27,772
<i>as a "home range" which they graze on
in groups called "sounders".</i>

435
00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:32,068
<i>They have the distinctive feeding technique
of kneeling when grazing.</i>

436
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:36,565
<i>They are herbivores, meaning they feed
mostly on grass,</i>

437
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:39,276
<i>leaves, roots and other organic matter.</i>

438
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:43,155
<i>This lioness has spotted
one of the young warthogs</i>

439
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:46,287
<i>and, like the cheetah,
knows that young animals</i>

440
00:38:46,366 --> 00:38:48,460
<i>are far easier to catch than adults.</i>

441
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:56,126
<i>This meal won't be enough to feed the pride,</i>

442
00:38:56,376 --> 00:39:00,222
<i>but will boost her energy enough to help her
bring in the next large meal.</i>

443
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:04,889
<i>Suddenly her hunting instincts
swing into action.</i>

444
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:08,475
<i>The young Warthog notices the danger
and tries to escape.</i>

445
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:12,981
<i>His speed is no match for the lioness
and she makes light work of the hog.</i>

446
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:19,114
<i>Although this is only a small meal,</i>

447
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:22,820
<i>the other lionesses from her pride
still crowd around for a snack,</i>

448
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:25,371
<i>but she is in no mood to share.</i>

449
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:32,499
<i>Out of respect, they leave her
to enjoy her meal in peace.</i>

450
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:59,277
<i>These male impalas are enjoying
the fresh grass near the water.</i>

451
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:02,484
<i>The males are distinctive,
because of their large horns.</i>

452
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:06,993
<i>The females identified by their lack of horns,
are not far behind,</i>

453
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:09,244
<i>looking on over the grazing males.</i>

454
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:20,131
<i>But who are these guys, grazing with them?</i>

455
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:25,219
<i>Thomson's gazelles, who we've met before,
are sympatric to the impalas.</i>

456
00:40:25,882 --> 00:40:28,601
<i>This means they sometimes
share the same territories</i>

457
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,178
<i>and live together peacefully.</i>

458
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:32,263
<i>These Thomson's gazelles are rutting,</i>

459
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:35,855
<i>which is an activity they perform annually
at the end of the rainy season</i>

460
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:38,062
<i>when they are in peak physical condition.</i>

461
00:40:38,645 --> 00:40:42,275
<i>Males do this to assert their dominance
and to impress females.</i>

462
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,742
<i>There is a third mammal
that lives in our crew.</i>

463
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,074
<i>These are the kongoni.</i>

464
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,744
<i>They are related to both
gazelles and impalas,</i>

465
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:58,457
<i>who are all part of a species called Bovidae.</i>

466
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:03,512
<i>Kongoni are quite large mammals
with males weighing around 300 pounds</i>

467
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:06,549
<i>and females weighing around 260 pounds.</i>

468
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:10,390
<i>Topi, seen here, are more athletic
than they look</i>

469
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:13,437
<i>and can reach running speeds
of 50 miles per hour.</i>

470
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:15,519
<i>Male topi have horns</i>

471
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:19,944
<i>and the size of their horns helps determine
their social standing within the herd.</i>

472
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:25,951
<i>Unfortunately, this elegant descendant of
an antelope is threatened with extinction.</i>

473
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:32,116
<i>We can only hope that this young topi calf
will not fall victim to a cheetah or leopard.</i>

474
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:40,707
<i>This extraordinary looking animal
is called a common eland</i>

475
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:43,130
<i>and moves in herds of 10 to 30.</i>

476
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:48,716
<i>As well as its beautiful distinctive markings,</i>

477
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:52,803
<i>the eland can make itself stop sweating
in order to conserve water.</i>

478
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:57,140
<i>This is vital in an environment
where water is so scarce.</i>

479
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:06,491
<i>It is amazing to think that our group of
Bovidae together with the eland</i>

480
00:42:06,566 --> 00:42:10,821
<i>can find enough nourishment in
the dryness of the savanna to survive.</i>

481
00:42:32,175 --> 00:42:36,555
<i>This lioness, one of the many lionesses
in the pride, doesn't have a mane.</i>

482
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:39,641
<i>This is an example of sexual dimorphism</i>

483
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:44,522
<i>and means that it is extremely easy
to tell a male and female lion apart.</i>

484
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:48,825
<i>But this lioness has always been
the dominant male's favourite.</i>

485
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:57,621
<i>Lions do not mate
at any particular time of year</i>

486
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:59,827
<i>as female lions are polyestrous,</i>

487
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:03,666
<i>meaning they are able to conceive
at any time throughout the year.</i>

488
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:09,429
<i>These two regularly break away from
the pride and spend time alone.</i>

489
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:17,141
<i>While the two lions are hiding in the grass,</i>

490
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:21,817
<i>the hungry marabou and vultures
are circling nearby searching for food.</i>

491
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:26,522
<i>A gang of hyenas have made another kill,
this time out of the birds' vision.</i>

492
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:32,239
<i>Spotted hyenas develop sharp teeth
behind their crushing premolars.</i>

493
00:43:32,527 --> 00:43:35,155
<i>This means that they can
hunt and kill live prey</i>

494
00:43:35,238 --> 00:43:38,617
<i>instead of depending on the scavenging
of already dead animals.</i>

495
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:43,045
<i>By this time the pesky marabous
have found the scent of the kill.</i>

496
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:48,131
<i>Hyenas are voracious eaters
and their highly specialised jaws</i>

497
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:52,715
<i>and digestive systems mean that they
can absorb nutrients from skin and bones.</i>

498
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:58,186
<i>A hyena has the ability to eat almost
every part of a carcass apart from hair,</i>

499
00:43:58,261 --> 00:43:59,854
<i>horns and hooves</i>

500
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:03,017
<i>and so when a group of hyenas
have finished eating,</i>

501
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:05,773
<i>there will be almost no trace
left of the carcass.</i>

502
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:10,357
<i>A couple of greedy marabous
are far easier to scare away than vultures</i>

503
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:12,783
<i>and this hyena makes light work of it.</i>

504
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:26,001
<i>Here, adult jackals travel back to
their burrows with their pups.</i>

505
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:36,220
<i>While raising their pups, jackals live in
disguised burrows of warthogs.</i>

506
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:46,814
<i>In their safe underground lair,
the jackals sleep sound at night,</i>

507
00:44:46,976 --> 00:44:49,980
<i>protected from predators
such as leopards or cheetahs.</i>

508
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:06,579
<i>The zebra herd is preparing to migrate.</i>

509
00:45:07,038 --> 00:45:09,962
<i>Several herds have joined together
to make the journey.</i>

510
00:45:17,006 --> 00:45:19,600
<i>This crocodile thinks he has found
a perfect place</i>

511
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:23,145
<i>where the migrating zebra and wildebeests
will make their crossing.</i>

512
00:45:33,022 --> 00:45:35,195
<i>The zebras have joined the wildebeests</i>

513
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:38,198
<i>and gather at the water's edge
to make the crossing.</i>

514
00:45:38,945 --> 00:45:42,370
<i>Their instinct is making them reluctant
to venture into the water.</i>

515
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:50,173
<i>On this occasion, the crocodile
has missed out on the opportunity.</i>

516
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:55,716
<i>The herd is moving away
from the river for now.</i>

517
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:10,852
<i>About 110 days have passed
since we saw the two lions alone.</i>

518
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:15,399
<i>This period of time is about the average
for a lioness pregnancy.</i>

519
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:19,736
<i>She has now given birth to two new cubs,
the result of her mating.</i>

520
00:46:24,657 --> 00:46:28,537
<i>Lionesses like to give birth in
a secluded area, away from the pride.</i>

521
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:36,086
<i>Cubs are vulnerable to attack from
jackals, snakes, eagles, leopards</i>

522
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:37,966
<i>and even other lions.</i>

523
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:46,600
<i>Lion cubs are born blind, and can't
use their eyes until about a week after birth.</i>

524
00:46:51,392 --> 00:46:54,817
<i>Cubs are essentially helpless
for the first few weeks of their lives,</i>

525
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:58,612
<i>relying almost completely on
their mothers to keep them alive.</i>

526
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:08,125
<i>Usually a lioness won't
introduce her cubs to pride life</i>

527
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,043
<i>until they are six to eight weeks old.</i>

528
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:15,045
<i>This is so she can care for them
in the safety of their hides</i>

529
00:47:15,124 --> 00:47:17,468
<i>without interruption
from other pride members.</i>

530
00:47:29,889 --> 00:47:33,735
<i>Mum is sure to move her cubs between
several different hides every month.</i>

531
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:38,072
<i>This is to prevent a scent from building up</i>

532
00:47:38,147 --> 00:47:41,321
<i>which could alert potentially
predatory animals to their whereabouts.</i>

533
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:46,910
<i>She can move her cubs
by picking them up in her mouth.</i>

534
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:49,659
<i>This may look painful for the cubs,</i>

535
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:53,671
<i>but they have particularly loose and stretchy
skin on the nape of their necks.</i>

536
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:57,584
<i>It is in this manner that Mum
moves her cubs between hideouts,</i>

537
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,174
<i>carrying them one by one
from one hideout to another.</i>

538
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:05,008
<i>It is only after three weeks
that they begin to walk.</i>

539
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:08,678
<i>This is very different from some of
the species we've seen before</i>

540
00:48:08,761 --> 00:48:10,513
<i>like zebras and elephants,</i>

541
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:13,270
<i>whose young can walk
almost immediately after birth.</i>

542
00:48:13,766 --> 00:48:17,270
<i>This is because lion cubs are kept
in the relative safety of a hide</i>

543
00:48:17,353 --> 00:48:19,230
<i>for the first few weeks of their lives.</i>

544
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:22,825
<i>These cubs will have
many challenges ahead of them.</i>

545
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:27,200
<i>As many as 80% of lion cubs die
before they reach maturity.</i>

546
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:39,671
<i>It's not only the lioness that has found
a partner and given birth.</i>

547
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:47,058
<i>The solitary leopard also must
increase the population.</i>

548
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:52,973
<i>She has chosen a partner
and they make their way into the long grass.</i>

549
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:03,317
<i>As you can see, there is
a certain level of sexual dimorphism</i>

550
00:49:03,399 --> 00:49:05,117
<i>between male and female leopards,</i>

551
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:08,279
<i>with the male being
far larger than the female.</i>

552
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:12,413
<i>Like lions, leopards are
able to mate all year round.</i>

553
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:17,084
<i>Leopards stay pregnant for between
90 and 105 days,</i>

554
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:20,254
<i>and like to give birth
in caves or hollow trees.</i>

555
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:29,596
<i>Leopard pairs stay together for several days
when mating and even hunt together.</i>

556
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:34,434
<i>While they are alone, they will mate
several times a day.</i>

557
00:49:48,194 --> 00:49:49,537
(CHIRPING)

558
00:49:57,328 --> 00:50:01,378
<i>The herd of wildebeests and
zebra are yet to make their river crossing.</i>

559
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:06,300
<i>The largest known herd of wildebeests
numbers over one million animals.</i>

560
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:11,058
<i>In human terms, this is almost
the entire population of Manhattan.</i>

561
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:16,310
<i>However, the members of our herd
are still amassing at the banks of the river.</i>

562
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:19,229
<i>After a while, some brave zebras</i>

563
00:50:19,308 --> 00:50:22,778
<i>take their first tentative steps
into the fast-flowing current.</i>

564
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:26,407
<i>It is immediately apparent
that this river crossing</i>

565
00:50:26,482 --> 00:50:29,201
<i>is going to be incredibly dangerous
for these animals.</i>

566
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:33,414
<i>Each year, 1.5 million wildebeests</i>

567
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:36,834
<i>go on a long trek
in search for food and water,</i>

568
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:39,128
<i>and unfortunately, every year</i>

569
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:44,004
<i>an estimated 250,000 animals
don't make it to their destination.</i>

570
00:50:44,667 --> 00:50:48,638
<i>So, the chances of being picked off
along the way are very high.</i>

571
00:51:00,224 --> 00:51:03,194
<i>More and more animals
congregate at the river's edge</i>

572
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:05,233
<i>and the scene grows chaotic.</i>

573
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:09,821
<i>Although it may look to be completely
disorganised, random and frenetic,</i>

574
00:51:10,109 --> 00:51:13,454
<i>recent research has found that
herds of animals crossing rivers</i>

575
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:16,206
<i>actually possess "swarm intelligence",</i>

576
00:51:16,532 --> 00:51:21,038
<i>whereby the animals work together
as a group to try and overcome obstacles.</i>

577
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:29,215
<i>The hurry with which these animals
have crossed the river</i>

578
00:51:29,295 --> 00:51:32,595
<i>has created somewhat of a traffic jam
on the river's far bank.</i>

579
00:51:33,382 --> 00:51:37,387
<i>This means that some of the animals remain
trapped in the river, leaving them vulnerable.</i>

580
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:44,898
<i>The animals take confidence
from seeing their fellow creatures</i>

581
00:51:44,977 --> 00:51:46,524
<i>successfully cross the river,</i>

582
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:50,407
<i>and more and more wildebeests
and zebra wade into the water.</i>

583
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:54,244
<i>However it may not be
as simple for some as it looks.</i>

584
00:51:57,990 --> 00:52:02,461
<i>This massive gathering of animals
has not gone unnoticed by this crocodile.</i>

585
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:06,382
<i>He and his friends
congregate slightly downstream</i>

586
00:52:06,582 --> 00:52:09,552
<i>waiting for an animal caught in trouble
to come their way.</i>

587
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:12,967
<i>The river's flow grows increasingly ferocious</i>

588
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:16,885
<i>and some of the animals are at real risk
of being swept downstream.</i>

589
00:52:24,183 --> 00:52:26,811
<i>Some of the weaker swimmers in the group
begin to struggle</i>

590
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:29,563
<i>and are dragged
further and further from the far bank,</i>

591
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:31,073
<i>which they are trying to reach.</i>

592
00:52:46,455 --> 00:52:49,504
<i>The zebra and wildebeests
have to swim extremely hard</i>

593
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:52,336
<i>to avoid being swept away
by the fast moving water.</i>

594
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:58,142
<i>Some of the animals,
although physically exhausted,</i>

595
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:01,645
<i>manage to make it to the other side
by the narrowest of margins.</i>

596
00:53:05,057 --> 00:53:07,981
<i>This animal unfortunately
was not strong enough</i>

597
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:10,187
<i>and is captured by the crocodiles.</i>

598
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:24,414
<i>This wildebeest has managed to
successfully cross the river,</i>

599
00:53:24,493 --> 00:53:27,667
<i>but now finds itself stranded
on the ledge of the far bank,</i>

600
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:29,582
<i>unable to reach the higher ground.</i>

601
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:34,962
<i>Wildebeests communicate visually, vocally,
and also through the sense of smell.</i>

602
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:39,350
<i>A male's bellow can be heard
up to 1.5 miles</i> away.

603
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,052
<i>The members of the herd use secretions</i>

604
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:44,726
<i>in order to guide fellow wildebeests
during their journey.</i>

605
00:53:45,264 --> 00:53:49,110
<i>This way the stragglers further behind
the herd will know which direction to go.</i>

606
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:53,906
<i>As we can see here, in our herd,
no one animal is left behind.</i>

607
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:58,115
<i>While some of the last stragglers
continue to complete the crossing</i>

608
00:53:58,485 --> 00:54:02,786
<i>the herd continues its long
and arduous migration across Africa.</i>

609
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:11,875
<i>The vast variety of life across Africa
is plain to see</i>

610
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:14,635
<i>for anyone who is lucky enough
to observe it.</i>

611
00:54:27,014 --> 00:54:28,516
<i>From giant water dwellers,</i>

612
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:33,403
<i>to ferocious cats stalking and hunting
their prey from trees and bushes.</i>

613
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:42,746
<i>Right through to the simple herbivores,</i>

614
00:54:46,575 --> 00:54:52,207
<i>the motherland of all life is still, as ever,
a metropolis of different species.</i>

615
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:03,346
<i>Each creature has its own journey
and its own story to tell.</i>

616
00:55:03,884 --> 00:55:06,933
<i>Each animal, no matter
how ferocious or deadly,</i>

617
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:10,232
<i>will have to battle through
bad times as well as the good.</i>

618
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:14,444
<i>The ever changing
environment that they live in</i>

619
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:18,065
<i>can be plentiful and barren, dry and wet,</i>

620
00:55:18,482 --> 00:55:22,282
<i>and these animals must be precise
with all their decisions.</i>

621
00:55:28,784 --> 00:55:31,537
<i>We have taken you
across the African savanna</i>

622
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:34,791
<i>and showed you some of
the amazing characters who live there.</i>

623
00:55:37,668 --> 00:55:40,296
<i>We have seen their struggles
and how they survive,</i>

624
00:55:40,629 --> 00:55:43,803
<i>how they work together
or how they prefer to live apart.</i>

625
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:51,356
<i>We have witnessed an annual cycle of birth
and death,</i>

626
00:55:51,515 --> 00:55:53,984
<i>along with daily life on the plains.</i>

627
00:55:58,146 --> 00:56:03,323
<i>But what unites these animals is not merely
a matter of finding food and surviving,</i>

628
00:56:03,861 --> 00:56:06,865
<i>but in the modern age, their great challenge</i>

629
00:56:06,947 --> 00:56:09,075
<i>is that of avoiding extinction.</i>

630
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:17,461
<i>Let's hope all the animals we have seen</i>

631
00:56:17,583 --> 00:56:22,259
<i>will continue to thrive on the savanna
for a long, long time to come.</i>
