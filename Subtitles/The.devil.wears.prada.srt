1
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Good luck.

2
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Hi. Uh, I have an appointment
with Emily Charlton?

3
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
- Andrea Sachs?
- Yes.

4
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Great. Human Resources certainly
has an odd sense of humor.

5
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Follow me.

6
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Okay, so I was Miranda's
second assistant...

7
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
but her first assistant recently got promoted,
and so now I'm the first.

8
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
- Oh, and you're replacing yourself.
- Well, I am trying.

9
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Miranda sacked the last two girls
after only a few weeks.

10
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
We need to find someone who can survive here.
Do you understand?

11
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Yeah. Of course. Who's Miranda?

12
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Oh, my God. I will pretend
you did not just ask me that.

13
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
She's the editor in chief of Runway,
not to mention a legend.

14
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You work a year for her, and you can
get a job at any magazine you want.

15
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
A million girls would kill for this job.

16
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It sounds like a great opportunity.
I'd love to be considered.

17
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Andrea,
Runway is a fashion magazine...

18
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
so an interest in fashion is crucial.

19
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What makes you think
I'm not interested in fashion?

20
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Oh, my God.

21
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
No! No! No!

22
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
What's wrong?

23
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
She's on her way. Tell everyone!

24
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
She's not supposed to be here
until 9:00.

25
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Her driver just text messaged,
and her facialist ruptured a disk.

26
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
- God, these people!
- Who's that?

27
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
That I can't even talk about.

28
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
All right, everyone! Gird your loins!

29
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Did somebody eat an onion bagel?

30
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Sorry, Miranda.

31
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Move it! Ooh!

32
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I don't understand why it's so difficult
to confirm an appointment.

33
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I know. I'm so sorry, Miranda.
I actually did confirm last night.

34
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Details of your incompetence
do not interest me.

35
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Tell Simone I'm not going to approve that girl
that she sent me for the Brazilian layout.

36
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I asked for clean, athletic, smiling.
She sent me dirty, tired and paunchy.

37
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And R.S.V.P. yes
to the Michael Kors party.

38
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I want the driver to drop me off at 9:30
and pick me up at 9:45 sharp.

39
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
- 9:45 sharp.
- Call Natalie at Glorious Foods,
tell her no for the 40th time.

40
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
No, I don't want dacquoise. I want tortes
filled with warm rhubarb compote.

41
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Then call my ex-husband and remind him the
parent-teacher conference is at Dalton tonight.

42
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Then call my husband, ask him to meet me
for dinner at that place I went to with Massimo.

43
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Tell Richard I saw the pictures that he sent
for that feature on the female paratroopers...

44
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
and they're all so deeply unattractive.

45
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Is it impossible to find a lovely,
slender female paratrooper?

46
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
- No.
- Am I reaching for the stars here? Not really.

47
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Also, I need to see all the things that Nigel
has pulled for Gwyneth's second cover try.

48
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I wonder if she's lost any
of that weight yet. Who's that?

49
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Nobody. Um, uh-

50
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Human Resources sent her up about the new
assistant job, and I was preinterviewing her.

51
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
But she's hopeless
and totally wrong for it.

52
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Clearly I'm going to have to do that myself
because the last two you sent me...

53
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
were completely inadequate.

54
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So send her in. That's all.

55
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Right.

56
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
- She wants to see you.
- Oh! She does?

57
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Move!

58
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
- This is foul. Don't let her see it. Go!
- That's-

59
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Who are you?

60
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Uh, my name is Andy Sachs.

61
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I recently graduated
from Northwestern University.

62
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And what are you doing here?

63
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Well, I think I could do a good job
as your assistant.

64
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
And, um-

65
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Yeah, I came to New York to be a journalist
and sent letters out everywhere...

66
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
and then finally got a call
from Elias-Clarke...

67
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
and met with Sherry
up at Human Resources.

68
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Basically, it's this or Auto Universe.

69
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
- So you don't read Runway?
- Uh, no.

70
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And before today,
you had never heard of me.

71
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
No.

72
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And you have no style
or sense of fashion.

73
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Well, um, I think that depends
on what you're-

74
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
No, no. That wasn't a question.

75
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Um, I was editor in chief
of the Daily Northwestern.

76
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I also, um, won a national competition
for college journalists...

77
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
with my series on the janitors' union,
which exposed the exploitation-

78
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
That's all.

79
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Yeah. You know, okay.

80
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You're right. I don't fit in here.

81
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I am not skinny or glamorous...

82
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
and I don't know that much
about fashion.

83
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
But I'm smart.

84
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I learn fast
and I will work very hard.

85
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I got the exclusive
on the Cavalli for Gwyneth...

86
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
but the problem is, with that huge
feathered headdress that she's wearing...

87
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
she looks like she's working
the main stage at the Golden Nugget.

88
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Thank you for your time.

89
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Who is that sad little person?

90
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Are we doing a before-and-after piece
I don't know about?

91
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Brown and Law, please?
Thank you.

92
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
- Andrea.
- Hmm?

93
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Wait. You got a job
at a fashion magazine?

94
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
- Mm-hmm.
- What was it, a phone interview?

95
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
- Wow.
- Ow! Don't be a jerk.

96
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Miranda Priestly is famous
for being unpredictable.

97
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Okay, Doug. How is it
that you know who she is and I didn't?

98
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
- I'm actually a girl.
- Oh!

99
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
- That would explain so much.
- Look, seriously.

100
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Miranda Priestly is a huge deal.
I bet a million girls would kill for that job.

101
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Yeah, great.
The thing is I'm not one of them.

102
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Look, you gotta start somewhere, right?

103
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I mean,
look at this dump Nate works in.

104
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I mean, come on.
Paper napkins? Hello.

105
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Yeah. And Lily, she works at that gallery
doing, uh, you know-

106
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Oh, I'm sorry. What exactly is it
that you do anyway?

107
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Well, lucky for me,
I already have my dream job.

108
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You're a corporate research analyst!

109
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
- Oh, you're right. My job sucks.
- No!

110
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
- It sucks. I don't- It's boring.
- It's all right. Breathe.

111
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
- I'm trying.
- Here. Take a drink.

112
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
- I will have a drink. I will have a drink.
- Ah, yes.

113
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
- I'd like to propose a toast.
To jobs that pay the rent.
- To jobs that pay the rent.

114
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Jobs that pay the rent.

115
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Oh, baby. You should see the way
these girls at Runway dress.

116
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I don't have a thing to wear to work.

117
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Come on. You're gonna be
answering phones and getting coffee.

118
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You need a ball gown for that?

119
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I think I might.

120
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Well, I happen to think
you look great always.

121
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Aww! I think you're full of it.

122
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
- Hey. Come on. Let's go home.
- Yeah.

123
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I can think of something we can do
that doesn't require any clothing.

124
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
- Really?
- Mmm.

125
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Hello?

126
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Andrea, Miranda decided to kill
the autumn jacket story for September...

127
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
and she is pulling up
the Sedona shoot from October.

128
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You need to come into the office right this
second and pick up her coffee order on the way.

129
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
- Now?
- Now, get a pen and write this down.

130
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
- Now?
- Now, get a pen and write this down.

131
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I want one no-foam skimmed latte
with an extra shot...

132
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
and three drip coffees
with room for milk.

133
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Searing hot. And I mean hot.

134
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Hello?

135
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
- Where are you?
- Oh, I'm almost there. Yeah.

136
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Shoot! Oh!

137
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Is there some reason
that my coffee isn't here?

138
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Has she died or something?

139
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
No. God.

140
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Oh. Bloody time.

141
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
- I hope you know that this
is a very difficult job-
- Mm-hmm.

142
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
for which you are totally wrong.

143
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
And if you mess up,
my head is on the chopping block.

144
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Now, hang that up.
Don't just fling it anywhere.

145
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Okay. First of all,
you and I answer the phones.

146
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
The phone must be answered
every single time it rings.

147
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Calls roll to voice mail,
and she gets very upset.

148
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
If I'm not here-Andrea, Andrea-

149
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
you are chained to that desk.

150
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
- Well, what if I need to-
- What? No.

151
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
One time an assistant left the desk because
she sliced her hand open with a letter opener...

152
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
and Miranda missed Lagerfeld...

153
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
just before he boarded
a 17-hour flight to Australia.

154
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
She now works at TVGuide.

155
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Man the desk at all times. Got it.

156
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
- Uh-
- Miranda Priestly's office.

157
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
No, she's not available.

158
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Who is it?

159
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Yes, I will tell her
you called... yet again.

160
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
- Right. Remember, you and I
have totally different jobs.

161
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I mean, you get coffee-
and you run errands.

162
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Yet I am in charge of her schedule...

163
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
her appointments and her expenses.

164
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And, um, most importantly, um...

165
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I get to go with her to Paris
for Fashion Week in the fall.

166
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I get to wear couture.
I go to all the shows and all the parties.

167
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I meet all of the designers.
It's divine.

168
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Okay. Now, stay here. I'm going to
the art department to give them the Book.

169
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
- The-
- This is the Book.

170
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Now, it is a mock-up of everything...

171
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
in the current issue.

172
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
And we deliver it to Miranda's apartment
every night, and she retu-

173
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Don't touch it. She returns it to us
in the morning with her notes.

174
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Now, the second assistant
is supposed to do this...

175
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
but Miranda is very private
and she does not like strangers in her house.

176
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
So until she decides
that you are not a total psycho...

177
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I get the lovely task
of waiting around for the Book.

178
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Oh, Emily? What do I do-

179
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Deal with it.

180
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Hello. Mrs. Priestly's office.

181
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Hmm. That's what I meant.
Miranda Priestly's office.

182
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Um, you know, she is in a meeting.
Can I please take a message?

183
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Uh-huh.

184
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Okay. Can you please spell Gabbana?

185
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Hello?

186
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I guess not.

187
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I guessed an eight and a half.

188
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Um, uh, that's very nice of you...

189
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
but I don't think I need these.

190
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Miranda hired me.
She knows what I look like.

191
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Do you?

192
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Emily.

193
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Emily?

194
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
She means you.

195
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
- We just cut on the bias.
- That's not what I asked you.

196
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I couldn't have been clearer.
There you are, Emily.

197
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
- How many times do I have to scream your name?
- Actually, it's Andy.

198
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
My name is Andy.
Andrea, but, uh, everybody calls me Andy.

199
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I need 10 or 15 skirts from Calvin Klein.

200
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
- What kind of skirts do you-
- Please bore someone else with your questions.

201
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
And make sure we have Pier 59
at 8:00 A.M. tomorrow.

202
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Remind Jocelyn I need to see a few of those
satchels that Marc is doing in the pony.

203
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
And then tell Simone I'll take Jackie
if Maggie isn't available.

204
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
- Did Demarchelier confirm?
- D-Did D-Demarchel-

205
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Demarchelier.
Did he- Get him on the phone.

206
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Uh, o- okay.

207
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
- And, Emily?
- Yes?

208
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
That's all.

209
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It's just the cavalier disregard
for clear directions-

210
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Do you have Demarchelier?

211
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Uh, Demarchelier.

212
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
- Leave it.
- Do you have-

213
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I have Miranda Priestly calling.

214
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I have Patrick!

215
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Uh, no, she called me in there
and-and then she asked me about Pier 59.

216
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
And there was something
about Simone, Frankie, someone else.

217
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
And, um, she needs skirts
from Calvin Klein.

218
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
And, uh, there was something
about a pony.

219
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
- Did she say which skirts?
- No. No.

220
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
- Did she say what kind? Color, shape, fabric?
- I tried to ask her.

221
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
You may never ask Miranda anything.

222
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Right. I will deal with all of this,
and you will go to Calvin Klein.

223
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Eh- Me?

224
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Oh, I'm sorry. Do you have
some prior commitment?

225
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Some hideous skirt convention
you have to go to?

226
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Uh-

227
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Miranda?

228
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
- Are you there?
- I'm about to walk in. I'll call you as soon as-

229
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
- Hello? Hi.
- While you're out...

230
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Miranda needs you to go to Hermès
to pick up 25 scarves we ordered for her.

231
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
- Okay.
- Cassidy forgot her homework at Dalton.
Pick that up.

232
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Miranda went out to meet with Meisel, and
she will want more Starbucks when she gets back.

233
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
- Hot Starbucks.
- Can you just repeat that first-

234
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Hello?

235
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Oh, my God.

236
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
What took you so long?
I have to pee!

237
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
What?
You haven't peed since I left?

238
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
No, I haven't. I've been manning
the desk, haven't I? I'm bursting.

239
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Oh, hi.

240
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
You do coat. Do the coat!

241
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Okay.

242
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Now, be prepared.
The run-through is at 12:30.

243
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
People are panicking, so the phone
is going to be ringing off the hook.

244
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
The ru-The run-through. Right.

245
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Yes. Editors bring in options for the shoot,
and Miranda chooses.

246
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
She chooses every single thing
in every single issue.

247
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Run-throughs are a huge deal.
I don't know why you don't know that, Andrea.

248
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
- Okay. Are you ready?
- Oh, hi, hi.

249
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Right. Well, after the loo,
Serena and I are going to lunch.

250
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
- This is her- the new me.
- Hi.

251
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
- Told you.
- I thought you were kidding.

252
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
No, quite serious, yeah.
I get 20 minutes for lunch, and you get 15.

253
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
- When I come back, you can go.
- Okay.

254
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
What exactly is she wearing?

255
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Her grandmother's skirt.

256
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Hmm. Corn chowder.

257
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
That's an interesting choice.

258
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
You do know that cellulite is one
of the main ingredients in corn chowder.

259
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
So none of the girls here eat anything?

260
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Not since two became the new four
and zero became the new two.

261
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
- Well, I'm a six.
- Which is the new 14.

262
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Oh. Shoot.

263
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Oh, never mind. I'm sure you have plenty
more polyblend where that came from.

264
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Okay. You think my clothes are hideous.

265
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I get it.

266
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
But, you know, I'm not going
to be in fashion forever...

267
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
so I don't see the point of changing everything
about myself just because I have this job.

268
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Yes, that's true.

269
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
That's really what this multibillion-dollar
industry is all about anyway, isn't it?

270
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Inner beauty.

271
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Hello.

272
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Right. Come on.

273
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
- Miranda's pushed the run-through
up a half an hour.
- Mmm!

274
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
- She's always 15 minutes early.
- Which means?

275
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
- You're already late. Come.
- Shoot!

276
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Excuse me.

277
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Mr. Ravitz.

278
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Nigel.

279
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
- Issue going well?
- Oh, yes. Our best September ever.

280
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Great. Heard Miranda killed autumn jackets
and pulled up the Sedona shoot.

281
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
What's that costing me?

282
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
About 300,000.

283
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Must have been some lousy jackets.

284
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
- Irv Ravitz.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

285
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
This is Andy Sachs,
Miranda's new assistant.

286
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Congratulations, young lady.

287
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
A million girls would kill for that job.

288
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Bye-bye.

289
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
- Hmm?
- Chairman of Elias-Clarke, Irv Ravitz.

290
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,000
You know what they say?
Tiny man, huge ego.

291
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
No. And I've seen all this before.

292
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Theyskens is trying to reinvent
the drop waist, so actually it's-

293
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
- Where are all the other dresses?
- We have some right here.

294
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
- Stand, watch and listen.
- And I think it can be very interesting-

295
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
No. No, I just-
It's just baffling to me.

296
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Why is it so impossible
to put together a decent run-through?

297
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
You people have had hours and hours
to prepare. It's just so confusing to me.

298
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Where are the advertisers?

299
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
- We have some pieces from Banana Republic.
- We need more, don't we?

300
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
- Oh. This is-This might be-
What do you think of-
- Yeah.

301
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Well, you know me.

302
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Give me a full ballerina skirt
and a hint of saloon and I'm on board.

303
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
- But do you think it's too much like-
- Like the Lacroix from July?

304
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I thought that, but no, not with
the right accessories. It should work.

305
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Where are the belts for this dre-
Why is no one ready?

306
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Here. It's a tough call.

307
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
- They're so different.
- Hmm.

308
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Something funny?

309
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
No. No, no. Nothing's-

310
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
You know, it's just that both those belts
look exactly the same to me.

311
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
You know, I'm still learning
about this stuff and, uh-

312
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
"This... stuff"?

313
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Oh. Okay. I see.

314
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
You think this has nothing
to do with you.

315
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
You go to your closet...

316
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
and you select- I don't know-
that lumpy blue sweater, for instance...

317
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
because you're trying to tell the world
that you take yourself too seriously...

318
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
to care about what
you put on your back.

319
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
But what you don't know
is that that sweater is not just blue.

320
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
It's not turquoise. It's not lapis.

321
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
It's actually cerulean.

322
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
And you're also blithely unaware
of the fact...

323
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
that in 2002, Oscar de la Renta
did a collection of cerulean gowns.

324
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
And then I think it was
Yves Saint Laurent- wasn't it-

325
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
who showed cerulean military jackets?

326
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
- I think we need a jacket here.
- Mmm.

327
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
And then cerulean quickly showed up
in the collections of eight different designers.

328
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
And then it, uh, filtered down
through the department stores...

329
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
and then trickled on down
into some tragic Casual Corner...

330
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
and then trickled on down
into some tragic Casual Corner...

331
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
where you, no doubt,
fished it out of some clearance bin.

332
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
However, that blue represents
millions of dollars...

333
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
and countless jobs...

334
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
and it's sort of comical how you think
that you've made a choice...

335
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
that exempts you
from the fashion industry...

336
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
when, in fact...

337
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
you're wearing a sweater that was selected
for you by the people in this room...

338
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
from a pile of stuff.

339
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
So then I said,
"No, I couldn't see the difference...

340
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
between the two
absolutely identical belts"...

341
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
and you should have seen
the look she gave me!

342
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I thought the flesh
was gonna melt off her face.

343
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
It's not funny.

344
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
She's not happy unless everyone around her
is panicked, nauseous or suicidal.

345
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
And the Clackers just worship her.

346
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
- The who?
- They call them Clackers.

347
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
The sound that their stilettos make
in the marble lobby.

348
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
It's like,
"Clack, clack, clack. clack, clack."

349
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
And they all act like
they're curing cancer or something.

350
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
The amount of time and energy...

351
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
that these people spend on these insignificant,
minute details, and for what?

352
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
So that tomorrow they can spend
another $300,000 reshooting something...

353
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
that was probably fine to begin with...

354
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
to sell people things they don't need!

355
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
God!

356
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
- I'm not even hungry anymore.
- What?

357
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
- That is why those girls are so skinny.
- Oh. No, no, no.

358
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Give me that. There's, like,
eight dollars of Jarlsberg in there.

359
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
You know what?

360
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I just have to stick it out for a year.
One year.

361
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
And then I can do
what I came to New York to do.

362
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
But I can't let Miranda get to me.
I won't.

363
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Easy there, tiger.

364
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
- Oh, good morning, Miranda.
- Get me Isaac.

365
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I don't see my breakfast here.
Are my eggs here? Where are my eggs?

366
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Excuse me!

367
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Pick up the Polaroids
from the lingerie shoot.

368
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Have the brakes checked on my car.

369
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Where's that piece of paper
I had in my hand yesterday morning?

370
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,000
The girls need new surfboards or
boogie boards or something for spring break.

371
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
- Hello.
- The twins also need flip-flops.

372
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
- Ow!
- Oh, my gosh!

373
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Pick up my shoes from Blahnik,
and then go get Patricia.

374
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
- Who's that?
- Good girl! Good girl! Good girl!

375
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Get me that little table
that I liked at that store on Madison.

376
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Get us a reservation for dinner tonight
at that place that got the good review.

377
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
- Get me Isaac.
- Thirty-six thank-you notes delivered today.

378
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
- Where is everyone?
- Why is no one working?

379
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Get me Demarchelier.

380
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I have Miranda Priestly calling for-
Okay.

381
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I have Patrick.

382
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Thank God it's Friday, right?

383
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
At least Miranda will be in Miami,
so we don't have to be on call this weekend.

384
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
You know,
my dad's coming in from Ohio.

385
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Yeah, we're gonna go out to dinner,
maybe see Chicago.

386
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
You doing anything fun this weekend?

387
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Yes.

388
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Yeah, Nate said it was great.

389
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
He actually- He applied here, but they
wanted someone with more experience.

390
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
- Here.
- Huh? What's this?

391
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I don't want you
to get behind on your rent.

392
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
- Dad, how did you-
- It's-

393
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I'm gonna kill Mom.

394
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Dad, thank you.

395
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Mm-hmm.

396
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
- It's really good to see you.
- You too, honey.

397
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
So, you want to
start grilling me now...

398
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
or should we wait till after dinner?

399
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I thought I'd let you at least enjoy
the bread basket first.

400
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
No, no, no. It's okay.
Go right ahead.

401
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
We're just a little worried, honey.

402
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
We get e-mails from you
at your office at 2:00 A.M.

403
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Your pay is terrible.
You don't get to write anything.

404
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Hey, that's not fair.

405
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I wrote those e-mails.

406
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I'm just trying to understand why someone
who got accepted to Stanford Law...

407
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
turns it down to be a journalist,
and now you're not even doing that.

408
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Dad, you have to trust me.

409
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Being Miranda's assistant
opens a lot of doors.

410
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Emily is going to Paris
with Miranda in a few months...

411
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
and she's gonna meet editors and writers
from every important magazine.

412
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
And in a year, that could be me.

413
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
- All right?
- Mm-hmm.

414
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Dad, I swear, this is my break.

415
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
This is my- my chance.

416
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
This is my boss.

417
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
- I'm sorry, Dad. I have to take this.
- Take it. Take it.

418
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,000
- Hello. Miranda?
- My flight has been canceled.

419
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
It's some absurd weather problem.

420
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I need to get home tonight. The twins have
a recital tomorrow morning at school.

421
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
- What?
- At school!

422
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
- Absolutely. Let me see what I can do.
- Good.

423
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Hi. Um, I know this
is totally last minute...

424
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
but I was hoping that you
could maybe get a flight for my boss...

425
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
from Miami to New York tonight?

426
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Uh-

427
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
- It's right here. Thank you.
- Yeah, any kind of jet.

428
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
- From Miami to New York.
- Thank you.

429
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
- Yup, I need it tonight. I need it-
- Ow!

430
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
- I thought you were going out the other-
- Sweetie! No.

431
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
- It's over here, honey.
- Tonight.

432
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Hi. I'm trying to get a flight tonight-
for tonight- from Miami to New York.

433
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Yes, I know there's a hurricane.

434
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Nothing is flying out?
What do you mean, nothing is flying out?

435
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
It's for Miranda Priestly,
and I know that she's a client of yours.

436
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Yes. Yes, hi. I need a jet tonight
from Miami to New York.

437
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Yeah. Sorry. Hold on.
Hello? Miranda, hi.

438
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I'm trying to get you a flight, but no one
is flying out because of the weather.

439
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Please. It's just-
I don't know- drizzling.

440
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Someone must be getting out.

441
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Call Donatella. Get her jet.

442
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Call everybody else
that we know that has a jet. Irv?

443
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Call every- This is your responsibi-
This is your job.

444
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Get me home.

445
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Oh, my God!
She's going to murder me.

446
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
What does she want you to do, call the National
Guard and have her airlifted out of there?

447
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Of course not. Could I do that?

448
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Come on.

449
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Come on.

450
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
The girls' recital
was absolutely wonderful.

451
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
They played Rachmaninoff.
Everyone loved it.

452
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Everyone except me...

453
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
because, sadly, I was not there.

454
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Miranda, I'm so sorry.

455
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Do you know why I hired you?

456
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I always hire the same girl-

457
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
stylish, slender, of course...

458
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
worships the magazine.

459
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
But so often, they turn out to be-

460
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I don't know- disappointing and, um...

461
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
stupid.

462
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,000
So you, with that impressive résumé...

463
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
and the big speech
about your so-called work ethic-

464
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I, um- I thought you
would be different.

465
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I said to myself, go ahead.

466
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Take a chance.

467
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Hire the smart, fat girl.

468
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I had hope.

469
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
My God. I live on it.

470
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Anyway, you ended up
disappointing me more than, um-

471
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
more than any of the other silly girls.

472
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Um, I really did everything
I could think of.

473
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
- Uh-
- That's all.

474
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Excuse me!
Where do you think you're going?

475
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
She hates me, Nigel.

476
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
And that's my problem because-

477
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Oh, wait. No, it's not my problem.

478
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I don't know what else I can do because
if I do something right, it's unacknowledged.

479
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
She doesn't even say thank you.

480
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
But if I do something wrong,
she is vicious.

481
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
- So quit.
- What?

482
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
- Quit.
- Quit?

483
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I can get another girl to take your job
in five minutes- one who really wants it.

484
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
No, I don't want to quit.
That's not fair.

485
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
But, you know, I'm just saying
that I would just like a little credit...

486
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
for the fact
that I'm killing myself trying.

487
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Andy, be serious.

488
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
You are not trying.

489
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
- You are whining.
- I-

490
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
What is it that you want me
to say to you, huh?

491
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Do you want me to say, "Poor you.
Miranda's picking on you. Poor you. Poor Andy"?

492
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Hmm? Wake up, six.

493
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
She's just doing her job.

494
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Don't you know that you
are working at the place...

495
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
that published some
of the greatest artists of the century?

496
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Halston, Lagerfeld, de la Renta.

497
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
And what they did, what they created...

498
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
was greater than art
because you live your life in it.

499
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Well, not you, obviously,
but some people.

500
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
You think
this is just a magazine, hmm?

501
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
This is not just a magazine.

502
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
This is a shining beacon of hope for-

503
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
oh, I don't know-

504
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
let's say a young boy growing up
in Rhode Island with six brothers...

505
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
pretending to go to soccer practice
when he was really going to sewing class...

506
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
and reading Runway under the covers
at night with a flashlight.

507
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
You have no idea how many legends
have walked these halls.

508
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
And what's worse, you don't care.

509
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Because this place, where so many
people would die to work...

510
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
you only deign to work.

511
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
And you want to know why
she doesn't kiss you on the forehead...

512
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
and give you a gold star on your homework
at the end of the day.

513
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Wake up, sweetheart.

514
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
- Okay. So I'm screwing it up.
- Mmm.

515
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I don't want to.

516
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I just wish that I knew
what I could do to-

517
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
- Nigel?
- Hmm?

518
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Nigel, Nigel.

519
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
No.

520
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I don't know what you expect me to do.

521
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
There's nothing in this whole closet
that'll fit a size six.

522
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I can guarantee you.

523
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
These are all sample sizes-
two and four.

524
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,000
- All right. We're doing this for you. And-
- A poncho?

525
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
You'll take what I give you
and you'll like it.

526
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
- We're doing this Dolce for you.
- Hmm!

527
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
And shoes.

528
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
- Jimmy Choo's.
- Hmm.

529
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
- Manolo Blahnik.
- Wow.

530
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Nancy Gonzalez. Love that.

531
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Okay, Narciso Rodriguez.
This we love.

532
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
- Uh, it might fit. It might.
- What?

533
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Okay. Now, Chanel. You're in desperate
need of Chanel. Darling, shall we?

534
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,000
We have to get to the beauty department,
and God knows how long that's going to take.

535
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I mean, I have no idea
why Miranda hired her.

536
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Me neither. The other day,
we were in the beauty department.

537
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
She held up the Shu Uemura eyelash curler
and said, "What is this?"

538
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I just knew
from the moment I saw her...

539
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
she was going to be
a complete and utter disas-

540
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Miranda Priestly's office.

541
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
No, actually, she's not available,
but I'll leave word.

542
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Okay, thanks. Bye.

543
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
How did-

544
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
- Are you wearing the-
- The Chanel boots?

545
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Yeah, I am.

546
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
You look good.

547
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
- Oh, God.
- What?

548
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
- She does.
- Oh, shut up, Serena.

549
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
- See you guys tomorrow.
- Good night, man. Take it easy.

550
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Take care of that finger, huh?

551
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
So, what do you think?

552
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Uh, I think we better get out of here...

553
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
before my girlfriend sees me.

554
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
The gowns are fabulous.

555
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Mm-hmm.
We're gonna use the burgundy.

556
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Gotta find-

557
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
So we spent a whole semester
on potatoes alone.

558
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
You take the fry and squeeze it.

559
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
- See how firm that is?
- Hey. Oh, I'm so sorry I'm late.

560
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
There was a crisis
in the accessories department.

561
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
- I needed to find a python headband.
- Python's hot right now.

562
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I have exciting presents for all of you.

563
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Are you ready?

564
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
- What is that?
- It's a Bang & Olufsen phone.

565
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Charlie Rose sent it to Miranda
for her birthday.

566
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I looked it up on line.
It's $1,100.

567
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
- What?
- Wow!

568
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
And I have some products.
Mason Pearson hairbrushes.

569
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
- A little Clinique.
- Ooh!

570
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
- Oh, damn it. I love your job.
- Oh! One more.

571
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
A little thing.

572
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
- Do you want it? You want- Oh.
- Gimme! Gimme, gimme, gimme!

573
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
- I think she likes it.
- Oh, my God! This is the new Marc Jacobs!

574
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
This is sold out everywhere.
Where did you get this?

575
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Miranda didn't want it, so-

576
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
No, no, no, no, no. This bag is, like, $1,900.
I cannot take this from you.

577
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Yeah, you can.

578
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
- Why do women need so many bags?
- Shut up.

579
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
You have one. You put all your junk in it,
and that's it. You're done.

580
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Fashion is not about utility.

581
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
An accessory is merely
a piece of iconography...

582
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
used to express individual identity.

583
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
- Oh! And it's pretty.
- That too.

584
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Yeah. But the thing is, it turns out there is
more to Runway than just fancy purses.

585
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Look, here's an essay by Jay McInerney,
a piece by Joan Didion.

586
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Even an interview
with Christiane Amanpour.

587
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
- Looks like someone's been drinking the Kool-Aid.
- What do you-

588
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I got it. It's-Yup, the Dragon Lady.

589
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
- Oh, Miranda?
- Let me talk to her.

590
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
- I need that.
- I'll tell her to get her own scrambled eggs.

591
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Lily, no, no, no! Put that thing up!
I was gonna answer it!

592
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
It's gonna make-
Give me the... phone.

593
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Hi, Miranda.

594
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
- Ooh. Shh.
- Absolutely.

595
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
- Shh!
- Uh-huh. I'm leaving right now.

596
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:14,000
You know, you guys
didn't have to be such assholes.

597
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Um, excuse me.

598
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I'm looking for James Holt.

599
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Um, that's him right there.

600
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
- Oh. Thanks.
- No problem.

601
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
- I put my stuff out there, and I pray they improve.
- Really?

602
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
- Excuse me.
- Hi.

603
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I'm Andy.
I'm picking up for Miranda Priestly.

604
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Oh, yes.
You must be the new Emily.

605
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Nice to meet you.

606
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,000
- Oh, let me see that bag. Very, very nice.
- Ah.

607
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Distressed, studded leather, pieced by hand,
finished with a metallic fringe.

608
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Very nice, indeed.
Who made that fantastic thing?

609
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
You.

610
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Hmm. Duh. This way.

611
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Uh, here we go.

612
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
It's a sketch of Miranda's dress
for the benefit.

613
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Also the centerpiece of my spring collection.
Top secret stuff.

614
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
- I'll guard it with my life.
- Please do.

615
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Come on.
You're working for Miranda Priestly now.

616
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,000
You must be in desperate need
of hard liquor.

617
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Excuse us, girls.

618
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
She'll have the punch.

619
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
It's deadly. Have fun.

620
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
- He's right, you know.
- Hmm?

621
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
The punch.
I drank it at James' last party.

622
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,000
I woke up in Hoboken wearing nothing
but a poncho and a cowboy hat.

623
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Ah. Well.

624
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Wise.

625
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
- Uh, hi.
- Christian Thompson.

626
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Christian Thompson?
You're kidding.

627
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
No, you're-You write for,
like, every magazine I love.

628
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
I actually- I reviewed your collection
of essays for my college newspaper.

629
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Did you mention my good looks
and my killer charm?

630
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
- No, but-
- What do you do?

631
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Oh. Well, I want to work for somewhere
like The New Yorker or Vanity Fair.

632
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
- I am a writer too.
- Is that right?

633
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
- Mm-hmm.
- I should read your stuff.
Why don't you send it over?

634
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Yeah?

635
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
That would be-Thank you.
That would be great.

636
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
But actually, right now, I'm working
as Miranda Priestly's assistant.

637
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Oh, you're kidding.
Well, that's too bad.

638
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
That's-Whoa.
You'll never survive Miranda.

639
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,000
- Excuse me?
- Well, you seem nice, smart.

640
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
You can't do that job.

641
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Gotta go.

642
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Okay.

643
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Well, it was very, very nice
to meet you, Miranda girl.

644
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Emily?

645
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Call James Holt's office. Tell them I want
to move the preview up to today at 12:30.

646
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Tell everybody else.
Be ready to leave in half an hour.

647
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
But we're not expected until Tuesday.
Did she say why?

648
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Yes. Yeah, she explained every detail
of her decision making.

649
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
And then we brushed each other's hair
and gabbed about American Idol.

650
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
I see your point.

651
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
- What's a preview anyway?
- Good morning, Miranda.

652
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Miranda insists upon seeing
all the designers' collections...

653
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
before they show them.

654
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
- Great to see you.
- Hello, James.

655
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
- And she tells them what she thinks?
- In her way.

656
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Uh, this season really began for me
with a meditation...

657
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
on the intersection
between East and West.

658
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
There's a scale.
One nod is good. Two nods is very good.

659
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
There's only been one actual smile on record,
and that was Tom Ford in 2001.

660
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
An obi belt.

661
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
She doesn't like it, she shakes her head.

662
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,000
This is the dress that we have designed
specifically and exclusively for you.

663
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Then, of course,
there's the pursing of the lips.

664
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Which means?

665
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Catastrophe.

666
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Just, uh-Just go.

667
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
- I just don't understand. I'm appalled.
- It's absurd. Appalled.

668
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
- You deal with it.
- I'll talk to him.

669
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,000
So because she pursed her lips,
he's gonna change his entire collection?

670
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
You still don't get it, do you?

671
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Her opinion is the only one
that matters.

672
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
- Call my husband and confirm dinner.
- At Pastis? Done.

673
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
And I'll need a change of clothes.

674
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Well, I've already messengered
your outfit over to the shoot.

675
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Fine. And, Andrea, I would like you
to deliver the Book to my home tonight.

676
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
- Have Emily give you the key.
- Mm-hmm.

677
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
- Guard this with your life.
- Of course.

678
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,000
You know, if I can deliver the Book,
that means I must have done something right.

679
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
I'm not a psycho.

680
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Oh, and, you know,
she called me Andrea?

681
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
I mean, she didn't call me Emily,
which is- Isn't that great?

682
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Yeah, whoopee. Right.

683
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Now, it's very important that you do
exactly what I'm about to tell you.

684
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Oh. Okay.

685
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
The Book is assembled by 10:00, 10:30...

686
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
and you must wait around for it
until then.

687
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,000
You will be delivering Miranda's
dry cleaning with the Book.

688
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Now, the car will take you straight
to Miranda's townhouse.

689
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
You let yourself in.

690
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Andrea. You do not talk to anyone.

691
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Do not look at anyone.

692
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
This is of the utmost importance.
You must be invisible.

693
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
- Do you understand?
- Uh-huh.

694
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
You open the door
and you walk across the foyer.

695
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,000
You hang the dry cleaning
in the closet across from the staircase.

696
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,000
- Uh-
- And you leave the Book
on the table with the flowers.

697
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,000
- Shit!
- It's that door to the left.

698
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Okay.

699
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Thank you.

700
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,000
- You can give the Book to us.
- Shh. Which-Which table?

701
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
- It's okay. Come on up.
- No, I can't. I can't.

702
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
- What? It's okay.
- Come on.

703
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
- Yeah, come on. It's okay.
- Please stop talking.

704
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Or you can bring the Book upstairs.
Emily does it all the time.

705
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,000
She does? Right.
She does, all the time.

706
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Yeah? Okay.

707
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
What did you expect me to do,
walk out in the middle of a cover shoot?

708
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
I rushed out of
an investment committee meeting...

709
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
and I sat there waiting for you
for almost an hour.

710
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
I told you the cellphones didn't work.
Nobody could get a signal out.

711
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
I knew what everyone
in that restaurant was thinking-

712
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
there he is, waiting for her again.

713
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
- Okay, okay! Okay, okay.
- Oh, no. Shh!

714
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
It really wasn't that big a deal.
I promise.

715
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
The twins said hello,
so I said hello back.

716
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,000
- Then I went up the stairs
to give her the Book and-
- You went upstairs?

717
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Oh, my God. Why didn't you just climb into bed
with her and ask for a bedtime story?

718
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Okay, I made a mistake. I know.

719
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Andrea, you don't understand.

720
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
If you get fired,
that might jeopardize Paris for me.

721
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,000
If that happens, I will search every Blimpie's
in the tristate area until I track you down.

722
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
She's gonna fire me?

723
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
I don't know. She's not happy.

724
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Andrea?

725
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Miranda, about last night, I-

726
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
I need the new Harry Potter book
for the twins.

727
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Okay. Okay. I'll go down
to Barnes & Noble right now.

728
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Did you fall down and smack
your little head on the pavement?

729
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Not that I can recall.

730
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,000
We have all the published Harry Potter books.
The twins want to know what happens next.

731
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
You want the unpublished manuscript?

732
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
We know everyone in publishing.
It shouldn't be a problem, should it?

733
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
And you can do anything, right?

734
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Yes, Bobbsey. I know, baby.

735
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Mommy's working very hard
to get it for you.

736
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
She doesn't get it.

737
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,000
I could call frickin' J.K. Rowling herself.
I'm not gonna get a copy of that book.

738
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
My girls are leaving on the train
for their grandmother's at 4:00...

739
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,000
so the book better be here
no later than 3:00.

740
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,000
- Of course!
- And I would like my steak here in 15 minutes.

741
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
No problem!

742
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Okay. I have four hours
to get the impossible manuscript.

743
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Smith & Wollensky's doesn't open until 11:30.
How am I gonna get the steak?

744
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Okay. I will be back in 15 minutes.

745
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
- Wish me luck!
- No. Shan't.

746
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes. I've been on hold.
It's for Miranda Priestly.

747
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
It's very important.

748
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Yes, I know it's impossible to get...

749
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
but, well, I was wondering if you
could make the impossible possible...

750
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
if that's at all possible.

751
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Yes, I'm calling about
the Harry Potter manuscript.

752
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Uh, no. Unpublished.

753
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Not a chance?

754
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Tell her that it's for Miranda Priestly.

755
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
'Cause I think it makes a difference.

756
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Let me call you back.

757
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
You probably don't remember me.
We met at James Holt's party.

758
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I'm Miranda Priestly's assistant.

759
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,000
The Harry Potter manuscript?
Oh, you're kidding.

760
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Uh, sorry to ask, but I'm desperate.

761
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Just tell her it can't be done.
You'll have to come up with a Plan "B."

762
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Well, this is Miranda Priestly
we're talking about.

763
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
There is no Plan "B."
There's only Plan "A."

764
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Is she back? Am I fired?

765
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
I rarely say this to people
who aren't me...

766
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
but you have got to calm down.

767
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Bloody hell!

768
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Coat, bag.

769
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,000
What's that? Oh, I don't want that.
I'm having lunch with Irv.

770
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
I'll be back at 3:00.
I'd like my Starbucks waiting.

771
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Oh, and if you don't have
that Harry Potter book by then...

772
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
don't even bother coming back.

773
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Hello.

774
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Quit? Are you sure?

775
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
I failed.
She's gonna fire me anyway.

776
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
- I might as well beat her to the punch.
- Wow.

777
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Andy, good for you.
Congratulations. You're free.

778
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
- Yeah. Well, listen, I'll call you later.
- Okay.

779
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Hello.

780
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
I'm brilliant. No, really.

781
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,000
- Monuments should be erected in my honor.
- You didn't.

782
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Oh, yes. A friend of a friend
does the cover art...

783
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
and she happens
to have the manuscript.

784
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Oh, no, 'cause that would mean
that I actually did something right.

785
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
It's just- Oh!

786
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
The thing is, Christian, I was just-

787
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Look, you want this thing, you better hurry.
I'll meet you at the St. Regis.

788
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Excuse me.

789
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,000
- Welcome to the St. Regis.
May I assist you with anything?
- Oh. Yes.

790
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,000
- Uh, I'm meeting someone at the King Cole Bar.
- Right this way.

791
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Hi.

792
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
- You have one hour.
- Thank you.

793
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,000
One copy. What are my twins
gonna do with that? Share?

794
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Oh, no, I made two copies...

795
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,000
and had them covered, reset and bound
so that they wouldn't look like manuscripts.

796
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,000
This is an extra copy to have on file.
You know, just in case.

797
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Well, where are these fabulous copies?
I don't see them anywhere.

798
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,000
They're with the twins,
on the train on the way to Grandma's.

799
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Is there anything else
I can do for you?

800
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Mm-mmm. That's all.

801
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Okay.

802
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,000
- Hey.
- Hey. I went to Dean & Deluca.

803
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Man, they charge, like,
five dollars a strawberry there.

804
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,000
But I figure since you quit your job...

805
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
we should celebrate.

806
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
- Listen, Nate.
- Wait a minute.

807
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
You quit your job, but you're still working
on the twins' science project?

808
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Well, that's big of you.

809
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Okay, after we talked, I realized...

810
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:58,000
it doesn't make sense throwing away
all those months of hard work.

811
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,000
I just had a moment of weakness,
that's all.

812
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Yeah, well, either that,
or your job sucks and your boss is a wacko.

813
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,000
All right. Whatever. It's your job.

814
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Nate.

815
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Come on.

816
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
I'm still the same person I was.

817
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,000
I still want the same things. Okay?

818
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:29,000
- Mm-hmm.
- I promise. Same Andy, better clothes.

819
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,000
I like the old clothes.

820
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Really?

821
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Well, what about these necklaces?
Do you like them?

822
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,000
No? And this dress, it's new.

823
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Eh.

824
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Well, there is one other thing
that's new...

825
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
that I thought you might like.

826
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,000
But, uh-What about this?

827
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
You don't like it.
I should better do-

828
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
No, no, no, no.

829
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Is this number two look?
This is number two?

830
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,000
- Hi.
- Hi. All right. Turn around for me, darling.

831
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Oh, I get it. I get it. I get it.

832
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
The piece is called "urban jungle," right?

833
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Yes, the modern woman unleashes
the animal within to take on the big city.

834
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Good. Go.

835
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Sometimes I can't believe
I talk about this crap all day.

836
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
- Bobby, come here. Let me see.
- Oh, thank you.

837
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
- Make sure Miranda gets these as soon as possible.
- Mm-hmm.

838
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,000
And tell her I switched in the Dior
for the Rocha.

839
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,000
- Oh, great. Can't wait.
- Excuse me.

840
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
- Can we adjust the attitude?
- I'm sorry.

841
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,000
- Don't make me feed you to one of the models.
- I'm sorry.

842
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
It's a busy day.

843
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
My personal life
is hanging by a thread, that's all.

844
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Join the club. That's what happens
when you start doing well at work, darling.

845
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Let me know when your whole life
goes up in smoke.

846
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
That means it's time for a promotion.

847
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,000
No. All right, February,
back of the issue.

848
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Did anybody speak
with Salma's people yet?

849
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Yes, but she'd rather do a summer cover
because she has a movie coming out.

850
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:34,000
No. Also, I'm pulling the Toobin piece
on the Supreme Court women-

851
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
woman.

852
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
And I need to see a new draft
on that piece...

853
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
about shopping for a plastic surgeon-
It's dull.

854
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:45,000
And this layout
for the Winter Wonderland spread.

855
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Not wonderful yet.

856
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Oh, okay. I-I'll look at it.

857
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,000
What about Testino?
Where are we on that?

858
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Zac Posen's doing
some very sculptural suits.

859
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
So I suggested that, uh, Testino
shoot them at the Noguchi Garden.

860
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Perfect.

861
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Thank God somebody came to work today.

862
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
What about accessories for April?

863
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,000
One thought I had was enamel.
Um, bangles, pendants, earrings.

864
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
No. We did that two years ago.
What else?

865
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Um, well, they're showing a lot of florals
right now, so I was thinking-

866
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Florals? For spring? Groundbreaking.

867
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
But we thought about shooting them
in an industrial space.

868
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,000
We thought the contrast
between the femininity of the florals...

869
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
and the more raw, rough-hewn background
would create this wonderful tension between-

870
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
- No.
- Which?

871
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
- No.
- Which?

872
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,000
No.

873
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Does anybody else
have anything I can possibly use?

874
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Antibacterial wipes perhaps?

875
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,000
- How's the cold doing?
- Like death warmed up actually.

876
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Oh, God.

877
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:00,000
It's the benefit tonight.
I've been looking forward to it for months.

878
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
I refuse to be sick.
I'm wearing Valentino, for crying out loud.

879
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Right. Well, everybody will
be leaving soon to get ready...

880
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,000
so I suggest you go and drop Miranda's
Fendi bag off at the showroom...

881
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
and then I suppose you can just go home.

882
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Yeah? Oh, well, that is great.
Perfect actually.

883
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
I need to get to Magnolia Bakery before it closes.
It's Nate's birthday tonight.

884
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,000
So we're, uh,
having a little party for him.

885
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Yeah, I'm hearing this,
and I wanna hear this.

886
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Bye.

887
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:37,000
I love my job.
I love my job. I love my job.

888
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Hello?

889
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Before the benefit tonight,
I need to make sure...

890
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,000
that you're both fully prepped
on the guest list.

891
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:02,000
But I thought that only
the first assistant went to the benefit.

892
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Only when the first assistant
hasn't decided to become...

893
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,000
an incubus of viral plague.

894
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:12,000
You'll come and help Emily.

895
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,000
- That's all.
- Right.

896
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:19,000
These are all of the guests.
Miranda invites everyone.

897
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
We have to make sure that they all think
she knows exactly who they are.

898
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
And I've been studying for weeks.

899
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
I have to learn all these by tonight?

900
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,000
No, don't be silly, Andrea.
These too.

901
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Look, you better just start without me, okay?
I'll get there as soon as I can.

902
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Andy, come on, it's his birth-

903
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Okay, but hurry.

904
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Oh, please, believe me, I will.
This is the last thing that I wanna-

905
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Ooh, I love that. Uh, I'll call you
the second I'm leaving, okay?

906
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
- Will that fit me?
- Oh, yeah.

907
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,000
A little Crisco and some fishing line,
and we're in business.

908
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Well, nothing really. I mean, this is-

909
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:24,000
I mean, really, this is
the social event of the season.

910
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Oh, oh, my God.
Andy, you look so chic.

911
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Oh, thanks, Em. You look so thin.

912
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
- Do I?
- Yeah.

913
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Oh, it's for Paris.
I'm on this new diet.

914
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
It's very effective.
Well, I don't eat anything.

915
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,000
And then when I feel like I'm about to faint,
I eat a cube of cheese.

916
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
- Well, it's definitely working.
- I know.

917
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,000
I'm just one stomach flu
away from my goal weight.

918
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:21,000
That's John Folger, the new
artistic director of the Chelsea Rep.

919
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,000
- John, thanks for coming.
- Hey there.

920
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,000
- Oh, thank you.
It's always nice seeing you.
- Stop fidgeting.

921
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,000
I'm sorry. I'm so late.

922
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Just deal with it.
You have to be here.

923
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Emily, come here.

924
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Isn't that Jacqueline Follet
from French Runway?

925
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Oh, my God, and Miranda hates her.

926
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
She was supposed to arrive
after Miranda left.

927
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
- I didn't- Oh.
- Yeah.

928
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:53,000
- Miranda, fabulous event as always.
- You brought Jacqueline.

929
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
- Surprise.
- Quelle surprise.

930
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Oh, wonderful. We're so happy you were
able to come to our little gathering.

931
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Of course.
I plan my whole year around this.

932
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Well, we're so grateful that you do.

933
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,000
- Ciao.
- Have you gotten my note?

934
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Yes, I did.
We'll discuss it on Wednesday.

935
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:22,000
- Yes, I agree. No business tonight.
- Not tonight.

936
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Enjoy.

937
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Em.

938
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Oh, thanks. Thanks.

939
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Oh, um- Oh, my God.
I just can't remember what his name is.

940
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,000
I just saw his name this morning
on the list.

941
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,000
It's- Oh, I know this.
It's something to do with-

942
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Wait, he was- he was part of the-
Oh, God, I know this. Um-

943
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:52,000
It's Ambassador Franklin, and that's
the woman that he left his wife for, Rebecca.

944
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,000
- Rebecca. Ambassador.
- Miranda.

945
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,000
- You look fabulous.
- Oh, very kind.

946
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Thank you.

947
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
- Look at you.
- Hello.

948
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
You're-You're a vision.

949
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
- Oh.
- Thank God I saved your job.

950
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:23,000
You know,
I figured out a few things on my own too.

951
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Turns out,
I'm not as nice as you thought.

952
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,000
I hope not.

953
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Well, if it weren't
for the stupid boyfriend...

954
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,000
I'd have to whisk you away
right here and now.

955
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,000
- Do you actually say things like that to people?
- Evidently.

956
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Well, I gotta go.

957
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Are you sure? 'Cause my editor
for New York Magazine is inside...

958
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
and, you know,
I could introduce you two.

959
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:51,000
- You sent over your stuff
for me to look at? Remember?
- Yeah.

960
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,000
All right, I gotta admit, I only read a couple.
It was a very large packet you sent.

961
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,000
- Yeah.
- But what I did read wasn't half bad.

962
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
And, you know, I think-
I think you have a talent, Andy.

963
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,000
He should meet you.

964
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Why don't you come in?
Just for one drink.

965
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Um, okay, yeah.
I guess I could for one-

966
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,000
No, I can't.
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

967
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:18,000
All right.
Give my best to the boyfriend.

968
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Roy, I'm sorry.
Can you go any faster?

969
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
I'm sure Nate will understand.

970
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Yeah.

971
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Hey.

972
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Happy birthday.

973
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Nate, I'm so sorry.

974
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:07,000
I kept trying to leave,
but there was a lot going on.

975
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
And, you know, I didn't have a choice.

976
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Don't worry about it.

977
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,000
I'm gonna go to bed.

978
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Can we at least talk about this?

979
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
You look really pretty.

980
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Andrea?

981
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:28,000
- Do you have the Book?
- Oh. Uh-

982
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Mm.

983
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Paris is the most important week
of my entire year.

984
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,000
I need the best possible team with me.

985
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
That no longer includes Emily.

986
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Wait. You want me to-

987
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,000
No, Miranda.

988
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Emily would die.

989
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Her whole life is about Paris.

990
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:03,000
She hasn't eaten in weeks.
I-I can't... do that.

991
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Miranda, I can't.

992
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,000
If you don't go, I'll assume you're
not serious about your future...

993
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:13,000
at Runway or any other publication.

994
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
The decision's yours.

995
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
That's all.

996
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Hey, Andy.

997
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
- Hey.
- You coming to bed anytime soon?

998
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Uh, yeah. Five minutes, okay?

999
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Andrea, don't forget to tell Emily.

1000
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Do it now.

1001
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Don't pick up.

1002
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:50,000
- Don't pick up. Don't pick up. Don't pick-
- Hi.

1003
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,000
- Emily.
- Hi, hi. Sorry I'm late.

1004
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,000
It's just Miranda wanted
some scarves from Hermès.

1005
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,000
And she did tell me yesterday,
but I forgot like an idiot.

1006
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
And so I freaked out, of course.

1007
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Emily, Emily, I-I need to talk to you.

1008
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,000
I called Martine at home, and she opened
the shop early. Whoa! I'm sorry.

1009
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:08,000
She opened the shop early for me,
so I got them, which is great.

1010
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Okay. Um, Emily,
wh-when you come in...

1011
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
there's something
I have to talk to you about.

1012
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,000
- Well, I hope it's not another Miranda problem.
- Not exactly.

1013
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Well, good, because I've got so much
to deal with before I go. I swear to God-

1014
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Oh, my God!

1015
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Emily?

1016
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:42,000
I don't care if she was gonna fire you
or beat you with a red-hot poker!

1017
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
You should have said no.

1018
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Emily, I didn't have a choice.

1019
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
- Oh. Please.
- You know how she is.

1020
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,000
That is a pathetic excuse.

1021
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Thanks.

1022
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Do you know what really just...

1023
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,000
gets me about this whole thing...

1024
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,000
is that, you know, you're the one who said
you don't really care about this stuff.

1025
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:10,000
And you don't really care about fashion.
You just wanna be a journalist.

1026
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
What a pile of bollocks!

1027
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Emily, I know you're mad.
I don't blame you.

1028
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Face it, you sold your soul the day
you put on that first pair of Jimmy Choo's.

1029
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:24,000
I saw it. And you know what really
just kills me about this whole thing...

1030
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
is the clothes that you're gonna get.

1031
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,000
I mean, you don't deserve them.

1032
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:32,000
You eat carbs, for Christ's sake.

1033
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:36,000
God, it's so unfair!

1034
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
- Emily.
- Just go.

1035
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
- Emily, I-
- I said go!

1036
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
- You are going to Paris
for the couture shows?
- Mm-hmm.

1037
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
- That's the coolest fashion event of the year.
- Mm-hmm.

1038
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,000
- I mean, who are you going to see, Galliano?
- Yeah.

1039
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:04,000
- And Lagerfeld and Nicholas Ghesquiere.
- Yep.

1040
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Yes. Okay, now you're scaring me.

1041
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:10,000
- Hey.
- Hey.

1042
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:14,000
- This show is amazing. I am so proud of you.
- Thank you.

1043
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Okay, start with the photos in the back
and work your way forward.

1044
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,000
That is the way I designed it.
It is brilliant.

1045
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
- You will love it.
- Of course.

1046
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
And you, I have somebody
I want you to meet, okay?

1047
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Ooh, art and sex. Lead the way.

1048
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
- See you later.
- Okay.

1049
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Hey. Hey, Miranda girl.

1050
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,000
- Hi.
- I was just thinking about you.

1051
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Oh, come on.

1052
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
- It's true.
- No.

1053
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:04,000
I'm profiling Gaultier for Interview
and, uh, making my Paris plans.

1054
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:08,000
I found myself wondering
if, uh, you were gonna be there.

1055
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Well, actually, um, I am going.

1056
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Great. I'm staying in a fantastic
little hotel in the Seventh...

1057
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:23,000
right across the street from the falafel
restaurant that will change your life.

1058
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:28,000
I'm sorry. I'll be too busy working.

1059
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
You'll have to find
someone else's life to change.

1060
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Well, that's just it.

1061
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
I'm beginning to wonder if I can.

1062
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Lily.

1063
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Lily, he's just a guy I know from work.

1064
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,000
- Yeah, that looked like work.
- Look, you're making a big deal out of-

1065
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:01,000
You know, the Andy I know
is madly in love with Nate...

1066
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:04,000
is always five minutes early...

1067
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,000
and thinks, I don't know,
Club Monaco is couture.

1068
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
For the last 16 years, I've known
everything about that Andy.

1069
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:13,000
But this person? This "glamazon"
who skulks around in corners...

1070
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:17,000
with some random hot fashion guy?

1071
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
I don't get her.

1072
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:23,000
- Lily.
- Have fun in Paris.

1073
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
You going to Paris?

1074
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Uh, yeah. It just happened.

1075
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:33,000
I thought Paris
was a big deal for Emily or-

1076
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Great. Now you're gonna
give me a hard time too?

1077
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Hey, Andy. Andy!

1078
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:44,000
- Andy, what the hell is wrong with you?
- I-I didn't have a choice, okay?

1079
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
- Miranda asked me, and I couldn't say no.
- I know.

1080
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
That's your answer for everything lately,
"I didn't have a choice."

1081
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
- Like this job was forced on you.
- Nate, I get it, okay?

1082
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
Like you don't make
these decisions yourself.

1083
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,000
You're mad because I work late all the time
and I missed your birthday party.

1084
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
- And I'm sorry.
- Oh, come on. What am I, four?

1085
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
You-You hate Runway
and Miranda.

1086
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:04,000
And you think fashion is stupid.
You've made that clear.

1087
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Andy, I make
port wine reductions all day.

1088
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
I'm not exactly in the Peace Corps.

1089
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,000
You know, I wouldn't care if you were
out there pole dancing all night...

1090
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
as long as you did it
with a little integrity.

1091
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
You used to say this was just a job.

1092
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:20,000
You used to make fun
of the Runway girls.

1093
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,000
What happened?
Now you've become one of them.

1094
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:26,000
- That's absurd.
- That's okay. That's fine. Just own up to it.

1095
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:30,000
And then we can stop pretending like
we have anything in common anymore.

1096
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:34,000
- You don't mean that, do you?
- No, I do.

1097
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Well...

1098
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
maybe this trip
is coming at a good time.

1099
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Maybe we should take a break.

1100
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Nate?

1101
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:10,000
I'm sorry. Just... one second?

1102
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
You know,
in case you were wondering...

1103
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:19,000
the person whose calls you always take,
that's the relationship you're in.

1104
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
I hope you two
are very happy together.

1105
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Hello, Miranda.

1106
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Pardon. Miranda.

1107
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Maestro. Mmm.

1108
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:53,000
How are you? So glad to see you.
Thank you for coming.

1109
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:57,000
- You like the collection?
- Absolutely. I think it's the best in years.

1110
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,000
- This is very important for me.
Very, very important.
- I'm very happy for you.

1111
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
- This is my new Emily.
- Hello. How do you do?

1112
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:05,000
- I'm good. Pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

1113
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
You love the show?

1114
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Miranda. This way!

1115
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Miranda. Nigel.
Fashion's great gatekeepers.

1116
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Miranda, what is Runway's position
on French fashion versus American fashion?

1117
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
- I've been thinking-
- Oh.

1118
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:34,000
- You still owe me for Harry Potter.
- Oh, do I?

1119
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
- Of course you do. Are you working tonight?
- Oh!

1120
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:41,000
- No, actually Miranda has a dinner.
- Great, you're free.

1121
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Oh, but there is the problem
of le boyfriend.

1122
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Wait, don't tell me.
The boyfriend non plus?

1123
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Je suis très, très desolé.

1124
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Oh, you're so full of it.
You're not desolé at all.

1125
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
No, not even a little.
What time should I pick you up?

1126
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
- Uh-
- I'll call you.

1127
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
Yeah.

1128
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Oh.

1129
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Oh, there you are.

1130
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:33,000
We need to go over the seating,
uh, chart for the luncheon.

1131
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Okay. Um, yeah, sure.

1132
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
I have it right here.

1133
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:46,000
By all means, move at a glacial pace.
You know how that thrills me.

1134
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Okay.

1135
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,000
So...

1136
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:05,000
first of all, we need to move
Snoop Dogg to my table.

1137
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
But your table's full.

1138
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Stephen isn't coming.

1139
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Oh, Stephen is-

1140
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,000
So I don't need to fetch Stephen
from the airport tomorrow?

1141
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Well, if you speak to him
and he decides to rethink the divorce...

1142
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,000
then, yes, fetch away.

1143
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:28,000
You're very fetching, so go fetch.

1144
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:38,000
And then when we get back to New York,
we need to contact, um...

1145
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Leslie to see what she can do
to minimize the press...

1146
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
on all this.

1147
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Another divorce...

1148
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,000
splashed across page six.

1149
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:58,000
I can just imagine what they're
gonna write about me.

1150
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:03,000
The Dragon Lady, career-obsessed.

1151
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Snow Queen drives away
another Mr. Priestly.

1152
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Rupert Murdoch
should cut me a check...

1153
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,000
for all the papers I sell for him.

1154
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Anyway, I don't-

1155
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:20,000
I don't really care
what anybody writes about me.

1156
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:26,000
But my- my girls, I just-

1157
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:29,000
It's just so unfair to the girls.

1158
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
It's just...

1159
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
another disappointment...

1160
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:39,000
another letdown,
another father... figure-

1161
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:42,000
gone.

1162
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Anyway, the point is-

1163
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:51,000
The point is-

1164
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:56,000
The point is we really need to
figure out where to place Donatella...

1165
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,000
because she's barely
speaking to anyone.

1166
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,000
I'm so sorry, Miranda.

1167
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:14,000
If you want me to cancel
your evening, I can.

1168
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Don't be ridiculous.
Why would we do that?

1169
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Um, is-

1170
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Is there anything else I can do?

1171
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Your job.

1172
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
That's all.

1173
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Hi. I need Miranda's itinerary
for tomorrow.

1174
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
- Okay. Come on in.
- All right? Thanks.

1175
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:09,000
- Who put that together for you?
- This?

1176
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Oh, it's just-
it's just something I threw on.

1177
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Turn around. Let me see. Turn.

1178
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,000
- Mm. Incroyable.
- Yeah?

1179
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:22,000
- It's really just- No, it's- No, gorgeous.
- Yeah? Okay, good.

1180
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:25,000
Really. I think that
my work here is done.

1181
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Oh.

1182
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
We're going to celebrate.
I'm going to get some champagne.

1183
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Okay. What are we toasting?

1184
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:37,000
We are toasting, my dear,
to the dream job.

1185
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:42,000
The one that a million girls wanted.

1186
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Which I got months ago.

1187
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:47,000
I'm not talking about you.

1188
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Mm-hmm.

1189
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
- James Holt-
- Yeah.

1190
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Massimo Corteleoni...

1191
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,000
is investing in James's company
and taking it global.

1192
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:02,000
- Mm-hmm.
- Bags, shoes, fragrances- the works.

1193
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:06,000
And James needs a partner.

1194
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:12,000
And that partner would be me.

1195
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
- Does Miranda-
- No, no, Miranda knows, because-

1196
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:20,000
- Oh.
- Oh, she put me up for it.
God, no. Can you imagine?

1197
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
But- But- But you're leaving.

1198
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
- Mm-hmm.
- I can't imagine Runway without you.

1199
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:29,000
I know, I know,
but I'm so excited though.

1200
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:33,000
This is the first time in 18 years I'm going
to be able to call the shots in my own life.

1201
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Oh, my God!

1202
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:40,000
I'm going to be able to come to Paris
and actually see Paris.

1203
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Well, congratulations.

1204
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:48,000
- Huh? Oh.
- Nigel, you deserve it.

1205
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:54,000
You bet your size-six ass.

1206
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:57,000
- Four.
- Really?

1207
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
Cheers.

1208
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:03,000
- Cheers to you.
- To us.

1209
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Let me see that.

1210
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:13,000
Okay, I just wanna say that yes, there are things
Miranda does that I don't agree with, but-

1211
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:16,000
- Come on. You hate her. Just admit it to me.
- No.

1212
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:19,000
She's a- She's a notorious sadist...

1213
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
and not- not in a good way.

1214
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Okay, she's tough,
but if Miranda were a man...

1215
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:28,000
no one would notice anything about her,
except how great she is at her job.

1216
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:31,000
I'm sorry. I can't-

1217
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:35,000
- I can't believe this. You're defending her?
- Yeah.

1218
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:38,000
The wide-eyed girl peddling
her earnest newspaper stories?

1219
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:41,000
You, my friend,
are crossing over to the dark side.

1220
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
I resent that.

1221
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
- You shouldn't. It's sexy.
- Sexy?

1222
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:53,000
- Really?
- Really.

1223
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:01,000
So do you-
do you know where we're going?

1224
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,000
- 'Cause I'm lost.
- Yeah.

1225
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:05,000
Yeah, don't worry. I know this city
like the back of my hand.

1226
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:08,000
It's my favorite place
in the whole world.

1227
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
You know, Gertrude Stein once said...

1228
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:15,000
"America is my country,
and Paris is my hometown."

1229
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
It's true.

1230
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
What do you do?

1231
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Do you just write stuff like that down...

1232
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
and then file it away to use on us girls?

1233
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:28,000
- I'm Christian Thompson. That's my way.
- That's your way. Right.

1234
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:31,000
I work freelance.
I have a lot of free time on my hands.

1235
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:36,000
You know, I never understood...

1236
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,000
why everyone was so crazy about Paris...

1237
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:44,000
but... it is so beautiful.

1238
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Mm. I-I can't. I'm sorry.

1239
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:56,000
I can't. You know, Nate and I just split up
a couple days ago, and I can't.

1240
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
Ooh. I've had too much wine.

1241
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:05,000
And my hearing-vision-
judgment's impaired.

1242
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:12,000
No, I barely know you.
I'm in a strange city.

1243
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:18,000
I... am out of excuses.

1244
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Thank God.

1245
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Yes.

1246
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Oh, shoot.

1247
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Bonjour, madame.

1248
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
Uh, what the hell is this?

1249
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:32,000
What does it look like?
It's a mock-up.

1250
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Yeah. Of?

1251
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Of what American Runway will look like
when Jacqueline Follet is the new editor in chief.

1252
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Wh-They're replacing Miranda?

1253
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:47,000
Yeah. And she's bringing me in
to run all the editorial content.

1254
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,000
You're really surprised?

1255
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Jacqueline's a lot younger than Miranda.
She has a fresher take on things.

1256
01:29:54,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Not to mention American Runway's one
of the most expensive books in the business.

1257
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Jacqueline does the same thing
for a lot less money.

1258
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:08,000
And Irv-
Irv's a businessman, you know.

1259
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:13,000
Miranda will be devastated. Her whole life
is about Runway. He can't do that to her.

1260
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:16,000
It's done. Irv's gonna tell Miranda
after the party for James.

1261
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
And she has no idea?

1262
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
She's a big girl. She'll be fine.

1263
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Shi- I have to go.

1264
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Andy.

1265
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
Andy, it's done.

1266
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Baby, it's done.

1267
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
I'm not your baby.

1268
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
Allo.

1269
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Oh! Oh! Thank God you're there.

1270
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:52,000
- Excuse me?
- I need to talk to you right away.

1271
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
It's about Jacqueline Follet.

1272
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:59,000
Shit! Oh, shit! Shit, shit, shit!

1273
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:19,000
- Yes.
- Mr. Ravitz, I'm so sorry to bother you.
I was wondering-

1274
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Have you completely lost your mind?

1275
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:26,000
- I need to talk to you.
- Do not disturb me again.

1276
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:29,000
But, um, it's just for one- Miranda!

1277
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:51,000
Miranda. Miranda.
Wait, I need to talk to you.

1278
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
Irv is making Jacqueline Follet
the editor in chief of Runway.

1279
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Christian Thompson told me
he's gonna work for her.

1280
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:59,000
Irv is going to tell you today. I thought
maybe if I told you, that you could fix it.

1281
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Do I smell freesias?

1282
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:06,000
What? No.
I-I specifically told them-

1283
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:10,000
If I see freesias anywhere...

1284
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:14,000
I will be very disappointed.

1285
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:17,000
For 72 years, Runway
has been more than a magazine.

1286
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:21,000
It has been a beacon
of elegance and grace.

1287
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:27,000
Miranda Priestly is the finest
possible guardian of that beacon...

1288
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:32,000
setting a standard that inspires
people across the globe.

1289
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Miranda Priestly.

1290
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Thank you, my dear friend.

1291
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Bonjour.

1292
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Thank you very much
for coming today...

1293
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:08,000
to help celebrate
our dear friend, James Holt.

1294
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:20,000
But before I talk to you about James...

1295
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:24,000
and his many accomplishments...

1296
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:28,000
I would like first to share
some news with you.

1297
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Um, as many of you know...

1298
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:35,000
uh, recently Massimo Corteleoni...

1299
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:39,000
has agreed to finance the expansion
of the James Holt label...

1300
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:44,000
transforming the work
of this visionary artist...

1301
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:48,000
into a global brand,
which is really an exciting enterprise.

1302
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Runway and James Holt share
many things in common...

1303
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:57,000
chief among them,
a commitment to excellence.

1304
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:02,000
And so, it should come as no surprise
that when the time came...

1305
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:07,000
for James to choose the new president
of James Holt International...

1306
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
he chose from within
the Runway family.

1307
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:13,000
And it's my great happiness today...

1308
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:17,000
to announce to you all
that that person...

1309
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:23,000
is my friend
and longtime esteemed colleague...

1310
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
Jacqueline Follet.

1311
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Thank you. Merci.

1312
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:59,000
And now to the main event...

1313
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:02,000
our celebration of James Holt.

1314
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:05,000
We at Runway
are very proud to have been-

1315
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
When the time is right,
she'll pay me back.

1316
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
You sure about that?

1317
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:18,000
No.

1318
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:21,000
But I hope for the best.

1319
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,000
I have to.

1320
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
You thought I didn't know.

1321
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:50,000
I've known what was happening
for quite some time.

1322
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:56,000
It just took me a little while to find
a suitable alternative for Jacqueline.

1323
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:00,000
And that James Holtjob
was so absurdly overpaid...

1324
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
that, of course, she jumped at it.

1325
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:08,000
So I just had to tell Irv
that Jacqueline was unavailable.

1326
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:13,000
The truth is, there is no one
that can do what I do...

1327
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
including her.

1328
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:19,000
Any of the other choices would
have found that job impossible...

1329
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
and the magazine would have suffered.

1330
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:25,000
Especially because of the list.

1331
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:30,000
The list of designers, photographers...

1332
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:35,000
editors, writers, models, all of whom
were found by me, nurtured by me...

1333
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
and have promised me
they will follow me...

1334
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:40,000
whenever and if ever
I choose to leave Runway.

1335
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
So he reconsidered.

1336
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:51,000
But I was very, very impressed...

1337
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:55,000
by how intently you tried to warn me.

1338
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:58,000
I never thought I would say this,
Andrea...

1339
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:02,000
but I really-

1340
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
I see a great deal of myself in you.

1341
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:12,000
You can see beyond what people want
and what they need...

1342
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,000
and you can choose for yourself.

1343
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:21,000
I don't think I'm like that.

1344
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
I-

1345
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
I couldn't do what you did to Nigel,
Miranda.

1346
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:31,000
I couldn't do something like that.

1347
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:35,000
Mm. You already did.

1348
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
To Emily.

1349
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:45,000
That's not what I-

1350
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
No, that was- that was different.
I didn't have a choice.

1351
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:50,000
Oh, no, you chose.
You chose to get ahead.

1352
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:55,000
You want this life,
those choices are necessary.

1353
01:37:55,000 --> 01:38:00,000
But what if this isn't what I want?

1354
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:04,000
I mean, what if I don't wanna
live the way you live?

1355
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:07,000
Don't be ridiculous, Andrea.
Everybody wants this.

1356
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Everybody wants to be us.

1357
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:42,000
I have to be at work in 20 minutes.

1358
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:46,000
What's up?

1359
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Well, I just-

1360
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:52,000
I wanted to say
that you were right about everything.

1361
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
That...

1362
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:58,000
I turned my back on my friends
and my family...

1363
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
and everything I believed in...

1364
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:03,000
and- and for what?

1365
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:09,000
For shoes and shirts
and jackets and belts.

1366
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
Nate.

1367
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
I'm sorry.

1368
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
I-

1369
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
I flew up to Boston while you were gone.

1370
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:31,000
I interviewed at the Oak Room.

1371
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:34,000
And?

1372
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:38,000
And you're looking
at their new sous-chef.

1373
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:42,000
- I'm moving up there in a couple weeks.
- That's great. Congratulations.

1374
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:51,000
I don't know what I'm gonna do without
those late-night grilled cheeses, but-

1375
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:54,000
I'm pretty sure
they have bread in Boston.

1376
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:57,000
May even have Jarlsberg.

1377
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
We might be able
to figure something out.

1378
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
You think?

1379
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
Yeah.

1380
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:19,000
So, what about you?
I mean, what are you gonna do now?

1381
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Actually, I, uh-
I have a job interview today.

1382
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

1383
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
That's what you're wearing?

1384
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Shut up. I like this.

1385
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
- Andy, Greg Hill.
- Hello.

1386
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:39,000
Come on. These clips are excellent.

1387
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:42,000
This thing on the janitors' union,
that's exactly what we do here.

1388
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
My only question is, Runway?

1389
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,000
My only question is, Runway?

1390
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:48,000
You were there for less than a year.

1391
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
What the hell kind of a blip is that?

1392
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
Learned a lot.

1393
01:41:55,000 --> 01:42:00,000
In the end though,
I kind of screwed it up.

1394
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:04,000
I called over there for a reference,
left word with some snooty girl.

1395
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Next thing you know, I got a fax
from Miranda Priestly herself...

1396
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:10,000
saying that of all the assistants
she's ever had...

1397
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
you were, by far,
her biggest disappointment.

1398
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:17,000
And, if I don't hire you,
I am an idiot.

1399
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:23,000
You must have done something right.

1400
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Miranda Priestly's office.

1401
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:02,000
Hey, Emily, it's Andy. Don't hang up.
I have a favor to ask you.

1402
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:05,000
You have a favor to ask of me?

1403
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:08,000
Yeah. The thing is,
I have all these clothes from Paris...

1404
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
and I don't have anyplace
to wear them...

1405
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:15,000
so I was wondering if you
could take them off my hands.

1406
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:22,000
Well, I don't know.
It's a huge imposition.

1407
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:27,000
And I'll have to get them taken in.
I mean, they'll drown me.

1408
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:31,000
But I suppose I could help you out.
I will have Roy pick them up this afternoon.

1409
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:36,000
Thanks, Em. I appreciate it.
Good luck.

1410
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:50,000
You have some very large shoes to fill.

1411
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:53,000
I hope you know that.

1412
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:01,000
I don't understand
why it is so challenging...

1413
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:05,000
to get my car when I ask for it.

1414
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
Go.
