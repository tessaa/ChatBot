00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:40,181
Last year?
Yeah.

165
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,091
It's been hard on her.

166
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:45,590
Her mom was sick for a while.

167
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,293
Anything else?

168
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:57,529
Why has he been picking on me?

169
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,331
Yeah, he picks on you because
he thinks you're different.

170
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:00,432
But I'm not different

171

Nothing happening there.

Oh, well, then do it. Do it!
All right.

Hey, Broker.
Hey, Jimmy.

Broker!
All right, stand by the car, baby.

178
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,781
What's wrong?
Just stand by the car, please.

Don't take any shit, Jimmy.

180

Jimmy, back in the truck, please.

181
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,855
You owe my son a goddamn apology.

182
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:26,258
Take it easy,
like the officer said, okay?

183

Jimmy, back in the truck, please.

184

Some sneaky little bitch
cheap shots my son.

185

Somebody owes us a goddamn apology.

That's goddamn right.

Don't call her that, please.
Don't call her that.

Can you get in the
truck, please, honey?

189

Don't turn your back on me.

190

Honey, baby, get in the truck.

191

Get him, Jimmy. Get him, Jimmy.

Come on, take him down, Jimmy.

Hey, hey, hey.

Arrest him! Keith!
Get off of him. Back off.

Cassie, shut up.

200
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:00,325
You're gonna let him
get away with that?

It's okay, baby.
Get in the truck.

Am I in trouble here?
KEITH: No, no.

208
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:19,285
I saw what happened.
He was out of line.

209
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:22,389
You really had to take him
down that hard though?

210
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:25,484
Embarrassed a man in front
of his child, Mr. Broker.

211

It goes both ways, Sheriff.

Griffin place awhile back?

What you doing to
keep busy around here?

There a reason you're
asking these questions?

217

Well, maybe I'm
just being friendly.

218
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:44,603
Or maybe I'm bored,
or maybe I'm curious,

or whatever, it doesn't matter.

220

It's my right to ask.

221
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,581
Things got out of hand, Sheriff.
That won't happen again.

I need to cool way down?

Well, I hate to say it,

When he was talking to Keith,

I heard him say...
What, the fucking sheriff was there?

335
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:36,449
I heard him say he was living
at the old Griffin place.

Fuck.

337

Can't you go over there
and do some things?

I need a little something

No.

can control it, right?

357

Yeah.

358
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,294
I'll handle that Broker thing.

359
00:24:56,295 --> 00:24:57,997
Thank you.

Thanks.

I'm not very good with those things.
Missed half of them.

Don't worry. I'm on it.
It'll be fun.

You know, she really
likes you, Susan.

It's a bit of a milestone, I'd say.

Do you think you can
talk to her sometime?

368

Of course.

369
00:26:02,828 --> 00:26:04,701
Maddy used to talk
to her mom for hours.

370
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:08,599
I think she'd like to talk
to a woman more often.

371
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,767
I'd be happy to.

One more thing,

374
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:15,145
people around here can
do some foolish things.

375

like feuds, they still exist.

And you're new here.

378
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:24,882
So I just think it
would be best for Maddy

379
00:26:24,883 --> 00:26:26,851
if you would smooth everything over

380

fresh in people's minds.

had an emergency room.

a question mark, so.

Keep it smooth. Check.

389

You want something around here?
I don't think so.

390

Look, what happened, happened.

391

Not ours, yours.

make this go away, Jimmy?

From you?

395
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:33,988
I want an apology.

396
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,793

654
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:44,502
Yep.

655
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:06,323
Sheryl.
Sheryl Mott.

656
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:08,825
Surprise, surprise,
surprise.

657
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:12,530
You're not a hard man to find,
Werksey, old habits and all.

658
00:47:13,631 --> 00:47:15,970
How are you doing, Sheryl?

659
00:47:17,268 --> 00:47:18,970
What's up, kid?

660
00:47:19,437 --> 00:47:21,173
I want you to look at something.

661
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:23,712
Like what?

662
00:47:24,375 --> 00:47:28,311
You got a new gang tattoo
that you want to show me?

663
00:47:28,312 --> 00:47:31,114
It's a little bit
more important than that.

664
00:47:31,115 --> 00:47:34,023
It's a gift for Danny T.

665
00:47:42,493 --> 00:47:44,434
(LOCK BUZZING)

666
00:47:45,563 --> 00:47:47,401
GUARD: You got 10 minutes.

667
00:47:52,236 --> 00:47:55,042
"A gift," she says.

668
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,856
This guy killed my fucking kid.

669
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:08,855
Please tell me you know
where this motherfucker is.

670
00:48:11,822 --> 00:48:13,923
Guess what? Time to go.

671
00:48:13,924 --> 00:48:15,658
She does.

672
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:16,826
Hey, you can finish it tonight.

673
00:48:16,827 --> 00:48:18,131
Okay.

674
00:48:19,497 --> 00:48:21,040
Take care of this for me.

675
00:48:37,548 --> 00:48:39,091
Miss Klum?

676
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:43,024
What are you going to do now, Broker?
What do you want to say?

677
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:51,932
Wanna come to my
party this weekend?

678
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:58,610
What, Teddy? She's talking to
you, hon, not me. Come on.

679
00:48:59,537 --> 00:49:02,081
I guess. Yeah.

680
00:49:06,477 --> 00:49:08,748
Cool. Come on, let's go.

681
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:11,016
All right. Go on.

682
00:49:12,716 --> 00:49:15,658
Teddy got some blood on his shirt.
Are you replacing it?

683
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,821
Yeah, I'm replacing it.

684
00:49:17,822 --> 00:49:19,592
All right.
I guess that does it.

685
00:49:22,493 --> 00:49:24,673
See you around, Miss Klum.

686
00:49:34,405 --> 00:49:36,141
TEEDO:
So, I heard something interesting.

687
00:49:37,441 --> 00:49:40,610
Yeah? Something tells me you're
gonna tell me what that is.

688
00:49:40,611 --> 00:49:44,347
Just that Jimmy Klum got his ass whopped.
So did his kid.

689
00:49:44,348 --> 00:49:46,082
Fascinating.

690
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:47,584
Where did you hear that?

691
00:49:47,585 --> 00:49:50,920
Well, you shoot enough pool,
drink enough beer in town,

692
00:49:50,921 --> 00:49:52,641
you hear a little bit
of everything, Broker.

693
00:49:53,424 --> 00:49:56,593
By the way, that's old news.
We shook and made up.

694
00:49:56,594 --> 00:49:57,760
Is that what you think?

695
00:49:57,761 --> 00:49:58,862
Yeah.

696
00:49:58,863 --> 00:50:00,163
I got some new news for you.

697
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:02,139
People around here
don't shake and make up.

698
00:50:03,133 --> 00:50:05,368
It never goes away that easy.

699
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:07,674
It's old-school in the
feuding sense around here.

700
00:50:08,205 --> 00:50:11,341
Hey, someone broke into our house.
Is that old-school?

701
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:13,443
There it is, that's
called country payback.

702
00:50:13,444 --> 00:50:15,311
Somebody's just trying to scare
your ass out of here, is all.

703
00:50:15,312 --> 00:50:16,446
You'll be all right.

704
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:17,514
Jimmy Klum, you mean?

705
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:19,682
Fuck, no.
Jimmy Klum is a bitch.

706
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:21,784
Listen, I know
everybody around here,

707
00:50:21,785 --> 00:50:24,693
and Jimmy Klum's bitch ass
ain't breaking into shit.

708
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:27,891
Now, his wife's brother
is a whole different story.

709
00:50:27,892 --> 00:50:29,459
Who's his wife's brother?

710
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:31,961
They call him Gator
for some dumb-ass reason.

711
00:50:31,962 --> 00:50:34,631
Lives down by
the Rayville watershed.

712
00:50:34,632 --> 00:50:37,534
Fronts as a boat mechanic,
can't fix shit.

713
00:50:37,535 --> 00:50:39,408
But the word is he's
cooking up that meth.

714
00:50:42,306 --> 00:50:45,542
Hey, if I was you, I'd be real
careful around him, Broker.

715
00:50:45,543 --> 00:50:47,780
He ain't true, you hear me?

716
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:54,217
The sheriff know about him?
(LAUGHS)

717
00:50:54,218 --> 00:50:55,985
Know about him?

718
00:50:55,986 --> 00:50:57,987
Man, him and Sheriff Keith
got it all figured out.

719
00:50:57,988 --> 00:51:00,557
You see, Gator snitches for Keith,

720
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:03,026
throws him all the small
fish, makes his job easy.

721
00:51:03,027 --> 00:51:06,140
In turn, Sheriff looks the other
direction whenever Gator wants to cook.

722
00:51:06,664 --> 00:51:08,366
Some bullshit.

723
00:51:09,767 --> 00:51:11,668
Yeah, thanks for
the history lesson.

724
00:51:11,669 --> 00:51:13,202
Listen, I grew up
around these rednecks,

725
00:51:13,203 --> 00:51:16,384
and I think you ought to know
who you're fucking with.

726
00:51:17,708 --> 00:51:20,043
And in case you got any interest,

727
00:51:20,044 --> 00:51:23,987
Gator eats breakfast nearly every
day at Lions café, just like me.

728
00:51:24,348 --> 00:51:26,015
Now, he don't look
like much or nothing,

729
00:51:26,016 --> 00:51:27,752
but you remember what I told you,

730
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:29,762
he ain't true.

731
00:51:31,021 --> 00:51:33,223
Crazy, waiting to happen.

732
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:40,430
Hey, where are you?

733
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:44,033
They set the meet at this fucking
crayfish shack off Creek Road.

734
00:51:44,034 --> 00:51:45,935
You know I'm allergic
to this shit, right?

735
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:48,304
Just get it done,
all right, Sheryl?

736
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:51,040
The guy they're sending,
Cyrus Hanks.

737
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:55,144
<i>Are you fucking kidding me? I know him.
He's a fucking animal, Gator.</i>

738
00:51:55,145 --> 00:51:57,380
He's a fucking stone-cold killer.

739
00:51:57,381 --> 00:52:00,585
Look, don't worry about any of that.
Just make it happen.

Nice place, Cyrus.

Yeah, well, let's just say I'm
comfortable around fat people.

746
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:15,958
They eat the way
gamblers play the slots,

747
00:53:15,959 --> 00:53:18,061
they're fucking oblivious
to everything around them.

No, I'm fine.

Sweetheart, black coffee
with a little honey.

752

So, what's it going to take

753

to find this rat fuck?
You know where he is, yeah?

754

Him and his kid.

755
00:53:34,712 --> 00:53:39,224
And to get him,
you want what, exactly?

756
00:53:41,518 --> 00:53:44,320
I don't want anything for the narc.

757

He's a gift.
Oh, he's a gift? He's a gift.

your fucking skull into this table

773
00:54:33,237 --> 00:54:34,937
and then into the floor,
you understand me?

Bye.

Hi.

780
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:35,141
What are you doing?

781
00:55:37,768 --> 00:55:39,101
Cleaning.

782
00:55:39,102 --> 00:55:40,838
Cleaning?
Yeah.

783
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:42,811
It's filthy in there.

784
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:45,775
Well, I'm glad you noticed.

785
00:55:45,776 --> 00:55:47,080
What are you doing here?

786
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:52,652
I came to tell you that I dealt
with Broker, the girl's father.

787
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:54,450
I want you to stay away from him.

788
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:56,062
Hey, you got something for me?

789
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:58,621
Cassie, I'm trying
to tell you something.

790
00:55:58,622 --> 00:56:01,393
Do not go near Broker anymore.

791
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,460
Got it.

792
00:56:04,461 --> 00:56:05,833
Okay.

793
00:56:06,797 --> 00:56:09,799
Well, I'm not holding, so I'm
sorry, I can't help you.

794
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,467
You're not holding?

795
00:56:11,468 --> 00:56:12,669
Uh-huh.

796
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:15,071
Well, I think
that's fucking bullshit.

797
00:56:15,072 --> 00:56:16,639
Cassie, why don't you
just clean yourself up?

798
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:17,673
That's fucking bullshit!

799
00:56:17,674 --> 00:56:19,976
Take a fucking shower.
Then what the fuck are you doing here?

800
00:56:19,977 --> 00:56:21,143
Eat a sandwich or something.

801
00:56:21,144 --> 00:56:23,379
You take a fucking shower,
Gator, look at you!

802
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,181
Cassie, just pull
yourself together.

803
00:56:25,182 --> 00:56:26,816
I'm sick of this shit.
Hey, hey, hey.

804
00:56:26,817 --> 00:56:29,151
Shh! Teddy is sleeping.

805
00:56:29,152 --> 00:56:30,887
You wake him up, it's gonna be...

806
00:56:30,888 --> 00:56:32,588
Don't worry.

807
00:56:32,589 --> 00:56:34,700
I'm not gonna make
any noise, I'm leaving.

808
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:38,396
No more. I'm done.

809
00:56:40,497 --> 00:56:42,267
No more, Cassie.

810
00:56:46,503 --> 00:56:48,046
Yo, Gator.

811
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:53,982
How is it hanging, man?

812
00:56:54,878 --> 00:56:56,284

Look, Jimmy, you know that I already
keep your garbage business going.

Man, I need you to stop
giving that shit to my wife.

All right? Look at her, man.
She's falling to pieces.

You've worked up a pretty
bad rep around here,

father in front of him.

It pissed off some of the locals.

And his daughter beat up Jimmy's kid.
Can you believe that?

00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:45,681
Now, what kind of parent would teach
a kid to do something like that?

any more problems.
