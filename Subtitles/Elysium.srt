Please return all weapons to local embassy

316
00:27:40,196 --> 00:27:43,045
Fuck your 'Politikster'!
Fuck you!

317
00:27:55,363 --> 00:27:56,577
Look...

318
00:27:58,170 --> 00:27:59,133
Max...

319
00:28:03,491 --> 00:28:04,486
Max!

320
00:28:06,716 --> 00:28:08,393
What's wrong?
What happened?

321
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:11,584
Jesus, let me help you. Let's go.

322
00:28:14,185 --> 00:28:16,019
Max, what happened?

323
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:20,133
- Max, what happened?
- I shouldn't have gone in it.

324
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:23,185
Gone in where?

325
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:30,602
I took a full dose, man.

326
00:28:30,628 --> 00:28:31,816
Lethal dose.

327
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,299
You OK? Let me help.

328
00:28:37,741 --> 00:28:42,709
- You're gonna be OK, Max.
- They gave me Miporol, man.

329
00:28:43,573 --> 00:28:48,490
They gave me... Miporol.

330
00:28:49,942 --> 00:28:54,509
I got five fucking days!
I only got five days!

331
00:28:54,553 --> 00:28:56,466
You have to take this.

332
00:28:57,401 --> 00:29:01,700
- They can fix this shit
on Elysium, man.
- I know.

333
00:29:01,701 --> 00:29:05,123
- Gonna go see Spider.
- Max, Max!

334
00:29:05,251 --> 00:29:07,354
Take the pill!

335
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,718
There you go!

336
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,186
To see Spider, you need money.

337
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:20,543
I'll give you everything I have,
but it's not enough for a ticket.

338
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,561
He's going to give me a ticket.

339
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,382
He's gonna give me a fucking ticket.

340
00:29:29,715 --> 00:29:33,101
Frey, you know we've done everything
we could to help your daughter.

341
00:29:33,227 --> 00:29:34,856
But I had a meeting today with the board, 

342
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:36,580
and they're recommending that
we send her home with you.

343
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,177
How can I work here
and leave it at home?

344
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:40,978
You know it can happen
anytime, Dr. Faizel.

345
00:29:41,103 --> 00:29:44,917
I know, if she has another seizure,
of course bring her back here.

346
00:29:45,229 --> 00:29:48,144
But until then she's discharged.

347
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:52,113
This isn't Elysium.
We can't just heal her.

348
00:30:35,127 --> 00:30:36,553
Max!

349
00:30:36,981 --> 00:30:38,900
It's been a while, my brother!

350
00:30:39,529 --> 00:30:42,000
How's life at the factory?

351
00:30:42,497 --> 00:30:46,189
- I need to ask you a favour.
- What? I can't hear you. What?

352
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:51,326
I need a ticket. Up there.
And an ID.

353
00:30:51,452 --> 00:30:52,785
Oh.

354
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,925
Yeah, sure sure.

355
00:30:57,388 --> 00:31:00,560
Absolutely. You prefer
aisle or window?

356
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,997
Don't play games with me.
I'm fucking serious, man.

357
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,599
Listen, I'm gonna come back
 and work for you.

358
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,788
Anything you need.
I'll fucking pay it back.

359
00:31:12,913 --> 00:31:14,630
You know what?

360
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,376
This... is...

361
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,337
priceless.

362
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,482
This is priceless.

363
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:27,059
Yeah, let me ask you a question.

364
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:30,860
Do you have any idea
how many idiots 

365
00:31:30,861 --> 00:31:34,312
come in here saying
the same kinda bullshit?

366
00:31:34,541 --> 00:31:38,779
I got little kids 
coming here every day.

367
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:44,570
Max, if I were you, I'd get
the fuck out of here, right now

368
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:52,220
I did 3 years for you. Everything I did
for you, you're gonna get me up there.

369
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:55,000
Go ahead and shoot. I got so much
radiation in my body, right now,

370
00:31:55,001 --> 00:31:57,350
you're probably getting
a little sick yourself.

371
00:31:57,351 --> 00:32:00,435
- You really dying?
- I'm fucking dying, motherfucker.

372
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,595
See this ?... 
I put the gun down.

373
00:32:02,821 --> 00:32:07,475
Put the gun down! 
Put the gun down! Get out of here!

374
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,443
Okay!

375
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:14,700
Listen, I've been looking for
someone to take a job for me.

376
00:32:14,702 --> 00:32:17,926
But no one here has the balls.

377
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:22,000
You said you'd do anything, right?

378
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:24,127
Max...

379
00:32:32,354 --> 00:32:33,841
- Hey.
- I'm OK.

380
00:32:48,048 --> 00:32:49,167
This...

381
00:32:50,756 --> 00:32:52,247
My friend.

382
00:32:53,145 --> 00:32:56,462
This can be your ticket up there.

383
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,569
One last job for me,
You earn your way up.

384
00:33:02,923 --> 00:33:04,179
What is it?

385
00:33:04,557 --> 00:33:08,119
Take an Elysian asshole, right?

386
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:13,784
A billionaire who's down
on Earth for some business...

387
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:16,465
He's, he's here for, whatever.
We hijack him.

388
00:33:16,575 --> 00:33:18,568
- Fuck that!
- Relax.

389
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:21,589
The guy's like much worse.

390
00:33:21,721 --> 00:33:25,279
Forget his watch, forget his ride,
forget all that shit.

391
00:33:25,385 --> 00:33:28,538
This, is what you take.

392
00:33:30,898 --> 00:33:34,911
Organic Information,
right out of his head.

393
00:33:35,041 --> 00:33:39,392
I'm talking about the bank codes,
passwords, login data...

394
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:42,345
Access to billions.

395
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:48,616
All you have to do is plug into his brain,
download the data to yours with this baby...

396
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,733
And bring it to me.

397
00:33:51,049 --> 00:33:52,457
This is crazy, Max.

398
00:33:52,475 --> 00:33:57,836
Once we verify the data,
I'll give you a one way ride,
 all expenses paid.

399
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,847
Even throw in some snacks
and a drink.

400
00:34:01,156 --> 00:34:06,670
All you have to do is walk
into a house and use the
Med-bay, and you're cured.

401
00:34:07,844 --> 00:34:10,395
Sandro who will do the surgery.
You know him?

402
00:34:10,416 --> 00:34:12,999
-Fuck...
-Christ!

403
00:34:13,001 --> 00:34:14,000
I'm good.

404
00:34:14,003 --> 00:34:18,021
Actually, you seem all weak.

405
00:34:18,206 --> 00:34:19,827
And a fucked up, so...

406
00:34:19,832 --> 00:34:23,199
You know what? I have...

407
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,999
It's crazy, let's get out of here,
Please, listen to me.

408
00:34:27,138 --> 00:34:29,052
What am I gonna do?

409
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:31,170
I'll have them install...

410
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:32,830
...this!

411
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:35,008
A third generation Axo-suit.

412
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:39,197
We hook this into your nervous system,
and it'll make you as strong as a droid.

413
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,400
You're already under the knife, right?

414
00:34:41,401 --> 00:34:43,400
Let's get out of here, please.

415
00:34:43,401 --> 00:34:46,112
I want a 4 man team.
But I pick them.

416
00:34:46,182 --> 00:34:48,663
I'm sending my own data wrangler.

417
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:51,922
Brain to brain, that is real tough.

418
00:34:51,925 --> 00:34:56,688
OK, but I'm taking Julio, he gets
a ticket up there, same as me.

419
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,146
Yeah, sure.

420
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:00,672
OK, I'll go get the boys ready.

421
00:35:00,673 --> 00:35:01,863
Wait!

422
00:35:03,377 --> 00:35:06,251
It's gotta be John Carlyle.

423
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,447
The CEO of Armadyne, Carlyle?

424
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,150
That's the mark.

425
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,298
Secretary Delacourt,
Mr. Carlyle has arrived.

426
00:35:22,349 --> 00:35:27,471
You are here to persuade me to
renew our Armadyne contracts, yes?

427
00:35:27,774 --> 00:35:29,482
Astute as always.

428
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:32,149
Come with me.

429
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:43,113
I'm not interested
in your little ideas.

430
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:45,723
I am interested in
something much larger.

431
00:35:45,724 --> 00:35:48,399
This habitat is dying.

432
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:54,217
There is a political sickness inside of it.
A tumor that needs to be removed.

433
00:35:54,218 --> 00:35:59,274
You and your company are in
need of revenue that is drying up.

434
00:35:59,436 --> 00:36:00,689
So...

435
00:36:01,403 --> 00:36:03,424
You built the Torus.

436
00:36:03,514 --> 00:36:08,765
Can you override the servers and
place a new president in power?

437
00:36:11,706 --> 00:36:13,399
A coup?

438
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,799
Are you suggesting a coup?

439
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:18,599
Is it possible?

440
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,694
I could write a reboot sequence.

441
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:26,978
It'd shut down the entire system,
and at that point...

442
00:36:27,695 --> 00:36:30,379
you can encode a new President, yes.

443
00:36:30,455 --> 00:36:32,386
Then that is what you will do.

444
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:37,000
And you will have your contract
secured for the next 200 years.

445
00:36:37,001 --> 00:36:42,201
Missile Defense Batteries, Droids,
everything we need, to protect our liberty.

446
00:36:42,202 --> 00:36:47,065
all guaranteed, of course,
by your new President.

637
00:57:09,409 --> 00:57:11,300
Gonna let the girls out.

638
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:23,411
<i>13 grid, 3 to 11.

639
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:27,199
I'm authorising
a Full Containment Order.

640
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:30,100
Issue a No Fly Zone
for Los Angeles.

641
00:57:30,101 --> 00:57:33,300
- All of Los Angeles?
- The murderer's still out there.

642
00:57:33,301 --> 00:57:37,212
Until we apprehend him, No one
leaves the surface of that city.

643
00:57:42,916 --> 00:57:44,694

644
00:57:44,710 --> 00:57:46,364
What the f...?

645
00:57:50,936 --> 00:57:52,420
Max.

646
00:58:34,863 --> 00:58:37,611
- Hey, sweety!
- Hey.

647
00:58:37,635 --> 00:58:39,220
We can go home.

648
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,530
Am I better?

649
00:58:44,046 --> 00:58:46,972
I'm gonna get the car, okay?

650
00:58:49,881 --> 00:58:51,480
Be right back.

651
00:58:56,717 --> 00:58:58,871
Frey...

652
00:59:00,363 --> 00:59:02,601
Max!

653
00:59:04,603 --> 00:59:07,083
My God, what happened to you?

654
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:12,957
- Shit, gonna get the medics.
- No, no!

655
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,253
- I can't go in there.
- Max!

656
00:59:15,255 --> 00:59:17,441
- I can't go in...
- Max, listen, you need a doctor, OK?

657
00:59:17,442 --> 00:59:20,014
People are looking for me.
They're gonna kill me.

658
00:59:20,131 --> 00:59:22,000
- I came here for you.
 I need your help.
- Max!

659
00:59:22,001 --> 00:59:24,723
You've got to go through
the system to get treatment.

660
00:59:24,857 --> 00:59:28,535
Please help me.
I don't wanna die.

661
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,015
Max!

662
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:33,615
Max!

663
00:59:35,802 --> 00:59:37,487
Stay awake!

664
00:59:46,904 --> 00:59:51,096
- I wanna see the man.
- Mama's gonna help him, OK?

665
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:52,516
Try to sleep.

666
00:59:56,811 --> 00:59:58,855
Don't sleep!

667
00:59:58,901 --> 01:00:01,999
[SPAN]
You're too heavy for me. Max, help me!

668
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:04,342
[ENG]
Come on!

669
01:00:04,362 --> 01:00:06,985
Max, you can do it, come on!

670
01:00:09,407 --> 01:00:12,305
No, wait. Let's turn you over!

671
01:00:58,578 --> 01:01:01,612
Max, Max, wait.

672
01:01:05,192 --> 01:01:08,007
- Thank you.
- Who did this to you?

673
01:01:08,033 --> 01:01:10,589
Okay.
I got hurt at at work.

674
01:01:10,590 --> 01:01:16,217
I had to take a job from Spider
to try to get up there and get healed.

675
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:19,730
It went bad,
now I'm in trouble.

676
01:01:19,731 --> 01:01:21,318
Mommy?

677
01:01:23,286 --> 01:01:26,389
Hey, sweety, come here!

678
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,911
Who is that man?

679
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:37,287
His name is Max. Mommy knew him
when he was your age.

680
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:41,202
- It's Matilda.
- Hi!

681
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:43,800
You can go watch cartoons, OK?

682
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:46,099
I'll be right there.

683
01:01:48,453 --> 01:01:53,060
I didn't know you had...
I'm so sorry, I need to go.

684
01:01:53,187 --> 01:01:56,631
- Wait, Max, you can not leave.
- I shouldn't have come here. I have to leave!

685
01:01:56,700 --> 01:02:00,994
Max! She's dying. She's in
the final stages of leukemia.

686
01:02:01,943 --> 01:02:05,814
I told you my life complicated.
I need you to help me.

687
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,281
- I've no idea how to do this.
- How to do what?

688
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:12,599
- Get her to Elysium.
- I can't help her. I...

689
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:15,225
I would if I could.

690
01:02:15,645 --> 01:02:19,097
How about this? Fake citizenship.
If you took her there,

691
01:02:19,257 --> 01:02:22,332
- could you heal her with this?
- It doesn't work that way.

692
01:02:22,459 --> 01:02:25,792
This is coded to me,
it's locked to my DNA.

693
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:29,847
The people looking for me.They...
You don't understand who these people are.

694
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:32,829
If they find me here,
they will kill all of us.

695
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:36,166
The only thing I can do to help
you is leave. I promise you.

696
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:39,500
- She's all I have.
- I'm sorry.

697
01:02:45,432 --> 01:02:47,975
You have bandages.

698
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:51,707
Yeah. I got bandages.

699
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:56,985
What are you doing?

700
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:01,441
I don't want you to be sick.
You wanna hear a story?

701
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:03,611
N.., ah...

702
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:07,460
There once was a meerkat
who lived in the jungle.

703
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:10,446
He was hungry 
and he was small.

704
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:12,329
So small.

705
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:18,400
And the other big animals had all the food,
'cause they could reach the fruits.

706
01:03:18,408 --> 01:03:21,700
So he made friends
with a hippopotamus

707
01:03:21,701 --> 01:03:23,480
OK, stop!

708
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,273
It doesn't end well for the meerkat.

709
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:33,400
Yes, it does 'cause he can
stand on the hippopotamus' back 

710
01:03:33,401 --> 01:03:36,700
to get all the fruits that he wants.

711
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:41,617
- What's in it for the hippo?
- The hippo wants a friend.

712
01:03:57,783 --> 01:03:59,876
I'm sorry.

713
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:24,429

714
661
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Hey, boss.

715
01:04:41,845 --> 01:04:44,000
I think we got him.

716
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:51,764
Yank this fucking boat!

717
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:19,300
- Mommy, is everything OK?
- It's OK, sweety.

718
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,800
Clear !

719
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,100
[SPAN]
What is this?

720
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:36,900
[ENG]
Good afternoon.

721
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:41,200
Sorry to come bursting into
your home. Didn't mean to...

722
01:05:41,201 --> 01:05:43,400
traumatize your young daughter.

723
01:05:44,619 --> 01:05:48,300
Me and the boys here are
looking for a young gentleman...

724
01:05:48,301 --> 01:05:51,116
who was in this very house a moment ago.

725
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:54,100
We're hoping you can tell us
 where he went.

726
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:55,888
No.

727
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:57,999
I...

728
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,200
- I don't know where he is.
- I don't believe in ...

729
01:06:04,201 --> 01:06:06,994
...committing violent acts
in front of the kids.

730
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:09,680
So I just need you to 
close your eyes, sweetheart.

731
01:06:09,681 --> 01:06:14,804
- It's OK.
- I really need you to tell me.

732
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Hey?

733
01:06:16,301 --> 01:06:18,600
- You remember now?
- Mommy!

734
01:06:18,601 --> 01:06:21,868
Close your eyes,
keep your fucking eyes closed.
Keep her eyes closed.

735
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,711
Please, I don't know where he is.

736
01:06:23,712 --> 01:06:27,000
He was wounded,
I helped him and he left.

737
01:06:27,801 --> 01:06:28,898
Please!

738
01:06:28,899 --> 01:06:32,340
D'you fucking hear that?
No loyalty nowadays, hey?

739
01:06:36,449 --> 01:06:38,700
What's this here?

740
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:42,550
- This a hospital you're runninghere?
- She's sick.

741
01:06:42,551 --> 01:06:46,664
She's sick? Let me have
a look at her... Alright!

742
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:50,795
- Don't touch her.
- See that? Protective instinct, here!

743
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:54,172
- I said don't touch her!
- I'm just trying to have a word with your child.

744
01:06:54,256 --> 01:06:55,197
Do not touch her!

745
01:06:55,323 --> 01:06:58,186
- Bring her. Come!
- Where are you taking her?

746
01:06:58,412 --> 01:06:59,747
Sweety, it's OK.

747
01:07:00,081 --> 01:07:02,275
It's OK, darling. It's OK.

748
01:07:02,275 --> 01:07:04,262
Sit! Shut up!

749
01:07:18,473 --> 01:07:20,009
Stop!

750
01:07:23,067 --> 01:07:27,762
No, no, don't shoot him!
Put the gun down! Let him come!

751
01:07:28,514 --> 01:07:31,533
- You got something, didn't you?
- What?

752
01:07:31,659 --> 01:07:34,758
That's why they shut down
the sky... what is it?

753
01:07:34,759 --> 01:07:37,377
Wire transfers? Corporate intel?
You gotta have something big in there!

754
01:07:37,437 --> 01:07:39,406
No. I fucking got nothing, man!

755
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:43,934
It all got scrambled. Julio is dead.
You owe me. Let's go fucking now!

756
01:07:44,018 --> 01:07:47,522
We can't!
The flight system is jammed!

757
01:07:47,605 --> 01:07:49,758
Nobody is going up there.

758
01:07:52,801 --> 01:07:54,954
- Until when?
- Till I don't fucking know.

759
01:07:55,791 --> 01:07:59,393
- I gotta fucking get up there!
- Everyone needs to get up there.

760
01:07:59,521 --> 01:08:00,502
My guys are working on it.

761
01:08:00,545 --> 01:08:05,051
See if they have a hope in hell
of ever getting back online.

762
01:08:05,250 --> 01:08:07,600
But, for now...

763
01:08:08,077 --> 01:08:12,300
- Let's just take a look at
 that head of yours.
- Get away from me, man!

764
01:08:12,301 --> 01:08:17,224
Look at me, if they shut down
the whole fucking sky,

765
01:08:17,301 --> 01:08:20,224
for what's in your head...

766
01:08:20,344 --> 01:08:25,129
Maybe the key to opening it
could be in there too, right?

767
01:08:26,923 --> 01:08:28,061
Come on.

768
01:08:32,537 --> 01:08:33,878
Alright

769
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:47,455
They will hunt you to the edge
of the world for this.

770
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:48,710
What is it?

771
01:08:49,135 --> 01:08:51,672
It is a reboot program for Elysium.

772
01:08:51,769 --> 01:08:56,349
Whoever has this, has the power
to override their whole system.

773
01:08:57,350 --> 01:08:59,350
Open the borders...

774
01:08:59,443 --> 01:09:04,500
Make everyone
a citizen of Elysium.

775
01:09:05,330 --> 01:09:09,900
This can save your life.

776
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:15,100
- We can save everyone.
- When can I go?

777
01:09:15,101 --> 01:09:17,900
They're trying to hack through
the signal jam, but soon...

778
01:09:17,901 --> 01:09:21,222
- Don't bullshit me,
when can we go?
- I dunno.

779
01:09:21,223 --> 01:09:22,300
Five days... a week?

780
01:09:22,301 --> 01:09:25,584
Fuck you, I don't have 5 days!
I got hours.

781
01:09:25,585 --> 01:09:27,218
My guys are working on it.

782
01:09:27,219 --> 01:09:30,200
You're always working on it,
You can't get me up there.

783
01:09:30,201 --> 01:09:32,400
I don't know why you try
sending people up there,

784
01:09:32,401 --> 01:09:33,999
they just get fucking shot down.

785
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,694
Not with what's in your head!
That's what I'm talking about!

786
01:09:36,695 --> 01:09:39,996
We would control the system.
We would be in charge!

787
01:09:39,997 --> 01:09:42,900
We can change the course
of fucking history!

788
01:09:42,901 --> 01:09:43,900
Back up there...

789
01:09:43,901 --> 01:09:47,933
What I have in my head,
is worth a lot to them, right?

790
01:09:49,844 --> 01:09:55,315
Don't do this.
If it falls into the wrong hands,
they could shut us out for good.
