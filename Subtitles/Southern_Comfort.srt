1
00:00:36,067 --> 00:00:39,534
 OVER HERE.

2
00:00:39,601 --> 00:00:41,200
 EVERYBODY OUT
 OF THE TRUCK.

3
00:00:41,267 --> 00:00:42,834
 OVER TO
 THE AMMOS DUMP.

4
00:00:42,901 --> 00:00:51,234
 GET THE HELL GOING
 IN A HURRY.

5
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,601
CASPER, COME ON.

6
00:01:06,801 --> 00:01:08,234
 I HEARD
 THEY'RE LOOKING

7
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,467
 FOR PROFESSIONALS
IN AFRICA.

8
00:01:09,534 --> 00:01:10,968
WHAT,
WHORES?

9
00:01:11,033 --> 00:01:13,267
 NO, MERCENARIES,
SARGE.

10
00:01:13,334 --> 00:01:15,234
 MEXICO AND LATIN
AMERICA, TOO.

11
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,667
 I HEARD YOU GET
 $1,300 A MONTH

12
00:01:16,734 --> 00:01:18,434
 PLUS
 TRANSPORTATION.

13
00:01:18,501 --> 00:01:21,801
I WANT COMBAT SOLDIERS,
CASPER, NOT TYPISTS.

14
00:01:21,868 --> 00:01:23,067
I WAS TOLD TO REPORT
 TO YOU, SERGEANT.

15
00:01:23,133 --> 00:01:25,701
 I'M HARDIN.

16
00:01:25,767 --> 00:01:28,501
RIFLEMAN CHARLES HARDIN,
CORPORAL.

17
00:01:28,567 --> 00:01:29,801
WHERE YOU FROM,
CHARLIE?

18
00:01:29,868 --> 00:01:31,133
EL PASO.

19
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,367
IS THAT RIGHT?

20
00:01:32,434 --> 00:01:34,133
HOW DO YOU LIKE

21
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,434
BEING IN THE LOUISIANA
NATIONAL GUARD?

22
00:01:35,501 --> 00:01:37,000
I DON'T.

23
00:01:37,067 --> 00:01:38,567
 BUT THEN
 I DIDN'T MUCH LIKE

24
00:01:38,634 --> 00:01:40,267
BEING IN
 THE TEXAS GUARD EITHER.

25
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:42,901
NOT LIKING THE TEXAS
GUARD MAKES SENSE.

26
00:01:42,968 --> 00:01:44,667
NOT LIKING THE
LOUISIANA GUARD

27
00:01:44,734 --> 00:01:46,000
CAN GET YOU
INTO TROUBLE WITH ME.

28
00:01:46,067 --> 00:01:47,801
YOU GOT THAT?

29
00:01:47,868 --> 00:01:49,968
 I GOT IT.

30
00:01:50,033 --> 00:01:51,968
NOW, YOU GET YOUR BUTT
ON OVER TO SECOND SQUAD.

31
00:01:52,033 --> 00:01:53,534
YOU'LL RECON
WITH THEM.

32
00:01:53,601 --> 00:01:56,400
CASPER,
SHOW HIM THE WAY.

33
00:01:56,467 --> 00:01:58,267
INTRODUCE HIM
TO THE BOYS.

34
00:01:58,334 --> 00:01:58,934
 RIGHT.

35
00:02:19,501 --> 00:02:22,033
 [Simms] MAN, WE SURE GET ALL
 THE GOOD DETAILS AROUND HERE.

36
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,734
[Bowden] THIS'LL BE GOOD
EXERCISE FOR YOU.

37
00:02:23,801 --> 00:02:25,334
 PUT A LITTLE MUSCLE
 IN YOUR PANTS.

38
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,467
THAT'S THE LAST THING
 I NEED, COACH.

39
00:02:28,534 --> 00:02:30,267
 UNLESS YOU WANT
 TO TAKE CARE OF IT.

40
00:02:30,334 --> 00:02:32,667
LISTEN, STUCKEY.
MAYBE I'LL JUST MAKE YOU AN ASS

41
00:02:32,734 --> 00:02:34,868
SO YOU CAN TAKE CARE
OF IT YOURSELF.

42
00:02:34,934 --> 00:02:38,000
 [Men arguing]

43
00:02:38,067 --> 00:02:40,067
 KNOCK IT OFF!

44
00:02:40,133 --> 00:02:42,167
LISTEN, STUCKEY, I LIKE
A JOKE JUST LIKE ANYBODY.

45
00:02:42,234 --> 00:02:43,701
BUT I DON'T LIKE
THAT ONE.

46
00:02:43,767 --> 00:02:45,000
COME ON, MAN.

47
00:02:45,067 --> 00:02:47,234
 I'M WITH YOU, COACH.

48
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,801
 SPEAKING FOR MYSELF,
 I LIKE WOMEN.

49
00:02:49,868 --> 00:02:52,100
YEAH, WE WON'T BE
 SEEING MANY OF THEM.

50
00:02:52,167 --> 00:02:53,968
LIFE'S FULL
OF SURPRISES.

51
00:02:54,033 --> 00:02:56,133
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

52
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,868
I'VE ARRANGED A LITTLE TREAT
 FOR THE WEEKEND, BOYS.

53
00:02:58,934 --> 00:03:01,901
 SIX WHORES TO COMBAT
 ARE WAITING ON US ALL.

54
00:03:01,968 --> 00:03:03,767
 THEY'LL FUCK US
IN A MORE INTERESTING WAY

55
00:03:03,834 --> 00:03:05,467
 THAN THE LOUISIANA
 NATIONAL GUARD.

56
00:03:05,534 --> 00:03:06,901
 YOU AIN'T KIDDING,
ARE YOU?

57
00:03:06,968 --> 00:03:08,167
 I NEVER JOKE
 ABOUT WOMEN.

58
00:03:08,234 --> 00:03:10,000
 WOMEN?
WHAT WOMEN?

59
00:03:10,067 --> 00:03:12,701
HE'S GOT SOME HOOKERS AT
THE END OF THE LINE, COACH.

60
00:03:12,767 --> 00:03:14,167
 YOU MEAN
PROSTITUTES?

61
00:03:14,234 --> 00:03:17,501
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I MEAN.

62
00:03:17,567 --> 00:03:23,100
 THIS IS A NEW LOW,
 SPENCER.
 EVEN FOR YOU.

63
00:03:23,167 --> 00:03:24,534
THEY'RE SCHEDULED
 TO MEET US

64
00:03:24,601 --> 00:03:26,033
 OUTSIDE OF
 CATAHOULA.

65
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,868
 THEY'LL BE THERE
 BY THE TIME WE EMERGE

66
00:03:27,934 --> 00:03:29,701
 FROM THE GREAT
 PRIMORDIAL SWAMP.

67
00:03:29,767 --> 00:03:30,567
YOU GOT ONE
FOR ME?

68
00:03:30,634 --> 00:03:32,067
 ME?

69
00:03:32,133 --> 00:03:33,133
 YOU MEAN US,
 DON'T YOU?

70
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,601
 WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE?

71
00:03:34,667 --> 00:03:37,067
BOYS, THE PURPOSE
 OF THE NATIONAL GUARD

72
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,601
 IS TO KEEP YOU
DARKER BROTHERS AWAY

73
00:03:38,667 --> 00:03:39,767
 FROM DECENT
 SOUTHERN WOMEN.

74
00:03:39,834 --> 00:03:41,601
MAN!

75
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:44,200
 HOWEVER, IN THE SPIRIT
 OF THE NEW SOUTH

76
00:03:44,267 --> 00:03:46,200
I'VE MADE
 FULL ARRANGEMENTS.

77
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:48,667
HOW ABOUT YOU,
HARDIN?

78
00:03:48,734 --> 00:03:50,801
 I GOT A WIFE.

79
00:03:50,868 --> 00:03:52,868
 YOU CAN COUNT ME
 OUT OF THIS ONE.

80
00:03:52,934 --> 00:03:54,467
 I SUPPOSE YOU'RE USED TO
MORE SERIOUS SOLDIERING

81
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:56,100
OVER IN EL PASO.

82
00:03:56,167 --> 00:03:58,000
WE HAD THINGS ORGANIZED.

83
00:03:58,067 --> 00:04:00,434
ALL WE DID WAS
 WATCH THE BALLGAME ON TV.

84
00:04:00,501 --> 00:04:02,534
 SHOOT DICE AND SLEEP.

85
00:04:02,601 --> 00:04:04,567
 THE LOUISIANA GUARD'S
 A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

86
00:04:04,634 --> 00:04:06,334
 THEY HAVE US DOING
IMPORTANT THINGS

87
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,033
 LIKE BEATING UP
 ON COLLEGE KIDS.

88
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,200
 TEAR-GASSING NIGGERS.

89
00:04:10,267 --> 00:04:11,534
 "PLEASE,
 MR. GUARDSMAN.

90
00:04:11,601 --> 00:04:13,367
 "NO MORE CANISTERS.

91
00:04:13,434 --> 00:04:15,734
"DON'T SET
 THE SHEPHERD DOGS
 ON ME."

92
00:04:15,801 --> 00:04:17,868
SEE WHAT I MEAN?

93
00:04:17,934 --> 00:04:19,968
 WE HAVE A LONG AND
NOBLE MILITARY TRADITION.

94
00:04:20,033 --> 00:04:28,367
 HEY, CASPER!

95
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,100
TURN IT OFF,
 STUCKEY,

96
00:04:30,167 --> 00:04:33,000
YOU DAMN,
 DUMB SON OF A BITCH.

97
00:04:33,067 --> 00:04:40,234
 [Soldiers laughing]

98
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,400
IN THE REAL WORLD,
DO YOU DO SOMETHING USEFUL

99
00:04:42,467 --> 00:04:43,667
OR ARE YOU LIKE
THE REST OF THE MEN

100
00:04:43,734 --> 00:04:44,834
OF THE SECOND SQUAD?

101
00:04:44,901 --> 00:04:46,067
I WORK FOR
 TREMCO.

102
00:04:46,133 --> 00:04:47,968
 CHEMICAL ENGINEER.

103
00:04:48,033 --> 00:04:51,133
COLLEGE MAN.

104
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,901
THEY'RE KIND OF RARE
IN TEXAS, AREN'T THEY?

105
00:04:53,968 --> 00:04:55,200
 THEY MANAGE TO
 COME UP WITH ONE

106
00:04:55,267 --> 00:04:57,234
 EVERY NOW
 AND THEN.

107
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,968
 ONE MIGHT GET
THE IMPRESSION

108
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:00,534
YOU DON'T ENJOY
THE OCCASIONAL CHAT

109
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:02,200
WITH YOUR
FELLOW GUARDSMAN.

110
00:05:02,267 --> 00:05:04,234
 GUESS WHAT?
 YOU'RE RIGHT.

111
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,400
WELL, I CAN'T SAY AS I BLAME
YOU HERE AND THERE.

112
00:05:07,467 --> 00:05:09,501
REECE IS UNDER THE
IMPRESSION MOST OF THE TIME

113
00:05:09,567 --> 00:05:11,367
THAT HE'S
IN A DIME NOVEL.

114
00:05:11,434 --> 00:05:13,067
STUCKEY,
HE'S NOT SMART ENOUGH

115
00:05:13,133 --> 00:05:14,534
TO READ
A DIME NOVEL.

116
00:05:14,601 --> 00:05:16,467
THE COACH, WELL...

117
00:05:16,534 --> 00:05:19,467
 I THINK I KNOW
 THE TYPE.

118
00:05:19,534 --> 00:05:21,834
LOOK, THESE GUYS
ARE OKAY.

119
00:05:21,901 --> 00:05:23,267
THEY JUST WANNA HAVE
FUN WITH YOU,

BEING THE NEW BOY.

121
00:05:24,467 --> 00:05:26,834
 THEY'RE NOT OKAY.

122
00:05:26,901 --> 00:05:28,067
 THEY'RE JUST
 LOUISIANA VERSIONS

123
00:05:28,133 --> 00:05:29,400
OF THE SAME
 DUMB REDNECKS

I SWEAR,
IT'S THE TRUTH.

FUCK YOU.

135
00:05:55,968 --> 00:05:57,968
I DON'T GIVE A SHIT
IF YOU BELIEVE IT OR NOT.

136
00:05:58,033 --> 00:06:00,067
FOR THOSE OF YOU
 WHO ARE INTERESTED,

137
00:06:00,133 --> 00:06:02,167
WE'RE GOING ON AN OVERNIGHT
 RECON AND PATROL.

138
00:06:02,234 --> 00:06:04,234
 HUSH UP AND LISTEN UP.

139
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,400
WE'VE BEEN DESIGNATED
 "BRAVO."

 THAT IS, "BRAVO TEAM."
 RECON AND SECURITY.

RENDEZVOUS POINT:
CHARLIE.

142
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,501
THAT IS, CHARLIE
 JUST OUTSIDE CATAHOULA.

143
00:06:14,567 --> 00:06:16,868
WE'RE GOING TO TRAVEL
 IN FILE FORMATION

144
00:06:16,934 --> 00:06:19,300
 WITH MAXIMUM USE OF
 COVER AND CONCEALMENT.

145
00:06:19,367 --> 00:06:21,167
 WE'RE TRAVELING TO MAKE TIME.

146
00:06:21,234 --> 00:06:23,167
NO TENTS,
NO SLEEPING BAGS.

147
00:06:23,234 --> 00:06:26,033
 PONCHOS
AND LINERS ONLY.

148
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,133
 WE'LL HAVE ALL KINDS
 OF WEATHER OUT THERE.

149
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,567
 SUN, RAIN,
 COLD IN THE MORNING.

150
00:06:30,634 --> 00:06:32,834
 GET USED TO THIS IDEA

151
00:06:32,901 --> 00:06:35,000
 YOU'RE GOING IN THE WATER,
 AND IT'S GOING TO BE COLD.

152
00:06:35,067 --> 00:06:38,133
 CRIBBS! YOU WITH US?

153
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,701
SURE I AM, SARGE.

154

I'M REALLY UP
FOR THIS ONE.

155
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:43,634
GOOD, BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING
 TO BE MY PACE MAN.

156
00:06:43,701 --> 00:06:45,901
 HA, HA, HA!

157
00:06:45,968 --> 00:06:49,434
 REECE, YOU'LL BE POINT.

158
00:06:49,501 --> 00:06:51,601
 NOW, WE'RE TALKING
 ABOUT 38 KILOMETERS.

159
00:06:51,667 --> 00:06:53,400
 MAKE SURE YOUR CANTEENS

160
00:06:53,467 --> 00:06:55,133
 ARE FILLED

 NO, GODDAMN IT,
 WE'RE NOT LEAVING HIM HERE.

323
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,701
WHO SAYS?

324
00:21:29,767 --> 00:21:30,634
 I SAY.
 I'VE GOT THE STRIPES.

325
00:21:30,701 --> 00:21:32,434
 I'M IN CHARGE

326
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:35,334
 AND I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ANYMORE SHIT ABOUT IT.

327
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,367
 NOW, LET'S JUST GO.

328
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,734
STUCKEY, YOU WERE SURE
ONE DUMB SON OF A BITCH,

329
00:22:01,801 --> 00:22:03,300
FIRING THAT MACHINE GUN.

330
00:22:03,367 --> 00:22:04,934
 YEAH, STUCKEY.

331
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,801
 NOBODY GAVE YOU
AN ORDER TO FIRE.

332
00:22:06,868 --> 00:22:09,100
 IT WAS ONLY
A GODDAMN JOKE.

333
00:22:09,167 --> 00:22:10,100
 IT WAS ONLY BLANKS.

334
00:22:10,167 --> 00:22:11,267
 FORGET IT.

335
00:22:11,334 --> 00:22:12,467
 FORGET IT?

336
00:22:12,534 --> 00:22:14,467
 SHIT.

337
00:22:14,534 --> 00:22:15,968
 THIS MORON GETS
 SOMEBODY KILLED

338
00:22:16,033 --> 00:22:17,367
 AND YOU SAY,
 "FORGET IT?"

339
00:22:17,434 --> 00:22:19,234
 I GOT SOMETHING
FOR YOU BOYS TO REMEMBER,

340
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,767
 STUCKEY
 DIDN'T SHOOT POOLE.

341
00:22:20,834 --> 00:22:22,501
 BIG THING IS,

342
00:22:22,567 --> 00:22:24,300
 AFTER WE GET POOLE
 TO THE HEADQUARTERS

343
00:22:24,367 --> 00:22:25,601
 WE'LL COME BACK
 AND GET THESE CAJUNS.

344
00:22:25,667 --> 00:22:27,400
HELL YES.

345
00:22:27,467 --> 00:22:29,434
ALL WE NEED TO DO IS SWIM
A COUPLE OF HUNDRED YARDS

346
00:22:29,501 --> 00:22:31,033
 AND THEN FIND THEM
 IN THAT FOREST.

347
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,033
 AFTER WE DONE THAT,

348
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,801
 WE CAN CAPTURE THEM AND
 SHOOT THEM WITH OUR BLANKS.

349
00:22:45,133 --> 00:22:47,033
 [Reece]
WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

350
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,334
 THIS BAYOU FORKS TO THE EAST.

351
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,133
 EASIEST TO GET
 WHERE WE WANT THAT WAY.

352
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,234
[Spencer]
 WE SHOULD HEAD NORTH.

353
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,834
 INTERSTATE'S NORTH.

354
00:22:53,901 --> 00:22:55,000
 [Reece] WE'RE GOING
 TO THE INTERSTATE.

355
00:22:55,067 --> 00:22:56,000
[Spencer]
 NOT IF WE GO EAST.

356
00:22:56,067 --> 00:22:57,267
 [Reece]
FUCK YOU.

357
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:58,801
 WHAT THE FUCK
 DO YOU KNOW?

358
00:22:58,868 --> 00:23:00,734
[Spencer] I KNOW THE BIG
 FIREBALL RISES IN THE EAST,

359
00:23:00,801 --> 00:23:02,167
 AND WE'RE WALKING
RIGHT INTO IT.

360
00:23:02,234 --> 00:23:03,467
[Reece] YOU GOTTA GO EAST
TO GO NORTH.

361
00:23:03,534 --> 00:23:05,067
[Spencer]
 YEAH, RIGHT.

362
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:06,701
 [Cribbs] YOU WANT TO
 RUN THAT BY ME ONCE MORE?

363
00:23:06,767 --> 00:23:08,801
WE GOT TO GO WHERE
 TO GO WHERE?

364
00:23:08,868 --> 00:23:10,667
[Hardin] CAN SOMEBODY
FIGURE OUT WHERE WE'RE GOING,
AND QUICK?

365
00:23:10,734 --> 00:23:11,934
[Casper]
SHUT UP.

366
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,400
 IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY,

367
00:23:13,467 --> 00:23:15,000
 AND WE'RE GOING EAST
 TO GET NORTH.

368
00:23:15,067 --> 00:23:16,667
 [Spencer] GO AHEAD
 AND DO WHAT YOU WANT.

369
00:23:16,734 --> 00:23:19,467
 THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE
 HELL I'M GONNA DO, SPENCER.

370
00:23:19,534 --> 00:23:21,033
 [Casper] NOW, LET'S MOVE
YOUR ASSES. COME ON.

371
00:24:14,667 --> 00:24:16,667
 TURKEY.

372
00:24:16,734 --> 00:24:18,667
 TURKEY MEAT,
 TURKEY SKIN,

373
00:24:18,734 --> 00:24:20,634
 CRACKER MEAL,
TURKEY FAT, SALT.

374
00:24:32,133 --> 00:24:34,868
 SMOKES MADE IT THROUGH
 THE WATER, HUH?

375
00:24:34,934 --> 00:24:40,434
YEAH, I SAVED A PACK.
 LUCKY, HUH?

376
00:24:40,501 --> 00:24:42,934
MAYBE IT'S ABOUT TIME
WE DIVIDE UP THE BULLETS.

377
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,501
 WHAT BULLETS?

378
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:46,000
 REECE HAS GOT
 SOME AMMO.

379
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:47,734
 HE ALWAYS
 BRINGS SOME ALONG

380
00:24:47,801 --> 00:24:49,934
 JUST IN CASE HE RUNS
 INTO ANY BIG GAME.

381
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,701
 BACK AT BIVOUAC

382
00:24:51,767 --> 00:24:55,267
 HE WAS SHOWING OFF
 A BOXFUL OF 5.56S.

383
00:24:55,334 --> 00:24:58,100
 WHAT THE HELL
 IS THIS ANYWAY, MAN?

384
00:24:58,167 --> 00:24:59,400
 SOME MILITARY SECRET
 OR SOMETHING?

385
00:24:59,467 --> 00:25:01,968
 NO WAY.

386
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:03,267
 I BROUGHT ALONG
 ONE BOX OF SHELLS

387
00:25:03,334 --> 00:25:05,300
 FOR MY OWN USE.

388
00:25:05,367 --> 00:25:07,234
 I'M LOCKED
 AND LOADED DOWN

389
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,501
IN CASE I MEET THE SONS
OF BITCHES THAT SHOT POOLE.

390
00:25:09,567 --> 00:25:11,267
 LET ME SEE YOUR WEAPON.

391
00:25:11,334 --> 00:25:14,734
YOU JUST STAY ON BACK.

392
00:25:14,801 --> 00:25:16,868
GIVE ME THE AMMO,
 WE'LL DIVIDE IT EVENLY.

393
00:25:16,934 --> 00:25:17,901
 WE'LL SHARE THEM.

394
00:25:17,968 --> 00:25:19,367
 BULLSHIT.

395
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:21,601
 IT'S MINE, AND THAT'S IT.

396
00:25:21,667 --> 00:25:23,534
 IT'S NOT RIGHT, REECE.

397
00:25:23,601 --> 00:25:26,334
 GIVE HIM THE BULLETS.
 IT'S A MILITARY SITUATION.

398
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,601
 I'M GIVING YOU
 A DIRECT ORDER, REECE.

399
00:25:28,667 --> 00:25:30,601
GIVE THEM TO ME.

400
00:25:30,667 --> 00:25:32,534
YOU COME ONE STEP CLOSER,
CASPER,

401
00:25:32,601 --> 00:25:35,334
AND I'LL GIVE YOU
SOMETHIN' ELSE.

402
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,234
THAT'S A COURT-MARTIAL
 OFFENSE, MAN.

403
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,634
GIVE ME THE AMMO,
 AND WE'LL DROP IT RIGHT HERE.

404
00:25:41,701 --> 00:25:43,534
 OTHERWISE I'M GONNA
 TURN YOUR ASS IN.

405
00:25:43,601 --> 00:25:47,000
 I DON'T GIVE A SHIT WHAT YOU--

406
00:25:47,067 --> 00:25:50,033
QUIT FUCKING AROUND
AND GIVE HIM THE RIFLE.

407
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:50,834
NOW.

408
00:26:13,033 --> 00:26:14,367
 I'LL TAKE HARDIN'S
 AND GIVE THEM TO HIM.

409
00:26:14,434 --> 00:26:15,100
 OKAY.

410
00:26:25,934 --> 00:26:32,601
HERE'S YOUR AMMO.

411
00:26:32,667 --> 00:26:36,634
BLADE TO THE THROAT, HUH?

412
00:26:36,701 --> 00:26:39,734
IS THAT HOW THEY DO
THESE THINGS IN EL PASO?

413
00:26:39,801 --> 00:26:44,400
 YEAH. THAT'S HOW THEY DO
 THINGS WHERE I GREW UP.

414
00:26:44,467 --> 00:26:46,467
I THOUGHT YOU WERE SOME KIND
OF CHEMICAL ENGINEER.

415
00:26:46,534 --> 00:26:48,167
 I AM.

416
00:26:48,234 --> 00:26:49,734
 I'M OUT OF THE HABIT
 OF SPENDING TIME

417
00:26:49,801 --> 00:26:52,901
 WITH A BUNCH OF
GUN-TOTING REDNECKS.

418
00:26:52,968 --> 00:26:54,934
WELL, YOU KNOW HOW IT IS.

419
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,100
IN LOUISIANA,
WE DON'T CARRY GUNS.

420
00:26:56,167 --> 00:26:58,801
WE CARRY ROPES.

421
00:26:58,868 --> 00:27:00,534
RC COLAS AND MOON PIES.

422
00:27:00,601 --> 00:27:02,501
WE'RE NOT TOO SMART,

423
00:27:02,567 --> 00:27:03,467
 BUT WE HAVE
 A REAL GOOD TIME.

424
00:27:18,968 --> 00:27:20,601
 WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
 CRIBBS?

425
00:27:20,667 --> 00:27:22,267
 I'M ON SENTRY.

426
00:27:22,334 --> 00:27:24,067
YOU WANT A HIT
OF SOME OF THIS STUFF?

427
00:27:24,133 --> 00:27:25,567
 HOW CAN YOU SMOKE
 THAT CRAP?

428
00:27:25,634 --> 00:27:28,000
I AIN'T ON YOUR TEAM,
COACH.

429
00:27:28,067 --> 00:27:29,934
 YOU COULDN'T MAKE
 THE SQUAD.

430
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,667
 THAT STUFF KILLS
 YOUR WILL TO WIN.

431
00:27:31,734 --> 00:27:34,701
HOW'D YOUR BOYS DO
THIS YEAR?

432
00:27:34,767 --> 00:27:36,534
 THIS WAS A REBUILDING YEAR.

433
00:27:36,601 --> 00:27:39,334
WE HAD INJURIES
 TO KEY PERSONNEL.

434
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,000
WE FINISHED 3 AND 7.

435
00:27:41,067 --> 00:27:42,467
WHAT DO YOU DO
 FOR A LIVING?

436
00:27:42,534 --> 00:27:44,200
 I PICK UP
A LITTLE CASH PIMPING

437
00:27:44,267 --> 00:27:46,067
BUT MOST OF WHAT
 I TURN OVER

438
00:27:46,133 --> 00:27:48,767
COMES FROM SELLING DOPE
TO HIGH-SCHOOL KIDS.

439
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:50,367
YOU'RE LUCKY
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

440
00:27:50,434 --> 00:27:52,334
NO, IT'S TRUE.

441
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,567
SOME OF MY BEST CUSTOMERS
ARE AT FREMONT HIGH.

442
00:27:54,634 --> 00:27:58,300
THEY WERE 10 AND 0
THIS YEAR, COACH.

443
00:27:58,367 --> 00:28:02,667
I DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN
 TO THIS BULLSHIT.

444
00:28:02,734 --> 00:28:05,033
HEY, LONNIE.
HUH.

445
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,701
 WHEN WE GONNA KICK
 THAT BOY'S ASS

446
00:28:06,767 --> 00:28:10,667
ALL THE WAY
 BACK TO EL PASO?

447
00:28:10,734 --> 00:28:14,067
SOON AS WE GET UP
 TO THE RENDEZVOUS.

448
00:28:14,133 --> 00:28:15,801
THEN WE GONNA COME BACK

449
00:28:15,868 --> 00:28:20,267
FOR THESE COON ASSES
THAT GOT POOLE.

450
00:28:20,334 --> 00:28:23,334
 LONNIE,

451
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:27,067
 DO YOU THINK
THIS WHOLE THING
 IS MY FAULT?

452
00:28:27,133 --> 00:28:29,300
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

453
00:28:29,367 --> 00:28:33,334
 IT'S DONE.

454
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,300
 HEY.

455
00:28:36,367 --> 00:28:38,200
 HOW CAN YOU GUYS
 PLAY CARDS

456
00:28:38,267 --> 00:28:39,868
 WITH SGT. POOLE
 LYING DEAD OVER THERE?

457
00:28:39,934 --> 00:28:41,567
YOU GOT ANOTHER IDEA

458
00:28:41,634 --> 00:28:43,133
ABOUT WHAT
WE SHOULD BE DOING?

459
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,267
 JUST DON'T SEEM RIGHT.

460
00:28:45,334 --> 00:28:47,767
POOLE DOESN'T CARE.
HE'S DEAD.

461
00:28:47,834 --> 00:28:49,467
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ANY OF US
CAN DO ABOUT IT.

462
00:28:49,534 --> 00:28:53,167
WHY NOT PLAY CARDS?

463
00:28:53,234 --> 00:28:54,167
 JUST DON'T SEEM RIGHT.

464
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,400
 IT'S UP THIS WAY.
OVER THERE.

465
00:29:06,467 --> 00:29:07,601
OKAY. COME ON.
 KEEP MOVING.

466
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,667
SPENCER, WHAT ABOUT
COMPANY COMMAND?

467
00:29:22,734 --> 00:29:23,968
SHOULDN'T THEY BE
WONDERING ABOUT US?

468
00:29:24,033 --> 00:29:25,567
NO, NOT YET.

469
00:29:25,634 --> 00:29:27,767
WE'VE BEEN OUT OF CONTACT
FOR 12 HOURS.

470
00:29:27,834 --> 00:29:29,167
 THEY SHOULD BE
 LOOKING FOR US.

471
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:30,767
 NO WAY.

472
00:29:30,834 --> 00:29:32,000
 IT'S THE NATIONAL
 GUARD, REMEMBER?

473
00:29:32,067 --> 00:29:33,501
WE WERE SUPPOSED

474
00:29:33,567 --> 00:29:34,934
 TO MEET THE TRUCKS
 20 MINUTES AGO.

475
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,033
 IN ANOTHER
HOUR AND A HALF,

476
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:36,901
THE TRUCKS WILL SHOW UP.

477
00:29:36,968 --> 00:29:38,434
AT 2:00,

478
00:29:38,501 --> 00:29:40,434
 THEY'LL ASK

00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:33,667
 AND YOU
 GO COOL OFF.

799
00:49:33,734 --> 00:49:34,467
 COME ON, MAN.

800
00:49:43,501 --> 00:49:47,634
SPENCER?

801
00:49:47,701 --> 00:49:50,467
 YEAH?

802
00:49:50,534 --> 00:49:52,734
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT
THE FUCK'S GOING ON HERE.

803
00:49:52,801 --> 00:49:54,434
I DON'T GET YOU.

804
00:49:54,501 --> 00:49:58,234
WELL, I'LL MAKE IT
REAL SIMPLE.

805
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:00,167
MY COMPANY TRANSFERS ME
TO BATON ROUGE.

806
00:50:00,234 --> 00:50:02,868
I BEEN DOWN HERE
ABOUT 6 MONTHS.

807
00:50:02,934 --> 00:50:04,334
 NOW, I DON'T KNOW
A GODDAMN THING

808
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,300
 ABOUT THE SWAMPS OF LOUISIANA.

809
00:50:06,367 --> 00:50:08,334
I GET SENT ON SOME BULLSHIT
 MILITARY EXERCISE

810
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,300
 AND ALL OF A SUDDEN

811
00:50:10,367 --> 00:50:12,901
 GUYS START COMING AT US
 FROM OUT OF THE TREES.

812
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:16,534
 NOW, I'LL ASK YOU AGAIN:
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE?

813
00:50:16,601 --> 00:50:19,067
 AND I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING.

814
00:50:19,133 --> 00:50:22,100
 I'M JUST A CITY BOY.

815
00:50:22,167 --> 00:50:24,000
 YOU GOT A QUESTION
 ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

816
00:50:24,067 --> 00:50:26,234
I HAVEN'T THE SLIGHTEST
 FUCKING IDEA.

817
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:28,033
 WE RAN INTO SOME
 REAL WEIRD PEOPLE

818
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:29,601
 AND MAYBE THEY'RE
 TRYING TO KILL US.

819
00:50:29,667 --> 00:50:31,601
ALL BECAUSE SOME ASSHOLE
FIRED BLANKS

820
00:50:31,667 --> 00:50:32,701
OUT OF HIS
DAMN MACHINE GUN.

821
00:50:32,767 --> 00:50:35,367
 YEAH.

822
00:50:35,434 --> 00:50:38,901
BECAUSE A BUNCH OF ASSHOLES
STOLE SOME BOATS.

823
00:50:38,968 --> 00:50:39,534
 YEAH.

824
00:51:41,234 --> 00:51:43,133
[Reece]
 CASPER, HE'S GETTING HEAVY.

825
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,267
IT CAN'T BE TOO
 MUCH FARTHER.

826
00:51:45,334 --> 00:51:47,033
WHY DON'T WE LEAVE HIM
AND COME BACK?

827
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:50,601
[Casper] NO,
 I TOLD YOU BEFORE.

828
00:51:50,667 --> 00:51:52,367
THIS SON OF A BITCH
 WEIGHS A TON.

829
00:51:52,434 --> 00:51:53,801
 [Casper]
 DON'T CALL POOLE THAT.

830
00:51:53,868 --> 00:51:54,834
 WELL,
HE CAN'T HEAR ME.

831
00:51:54,901 --> 00:51:56,634
WELL, I CAN.

832
00:51:56,701 --> 00:51:58,133
 SHIT, CASPER,
 THE COCKSUCKER'S DEAD.

833
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,467
 I'M JUST TALKING
ABOUT THE BODY.

834
00:51:59,534 --> 00:52:01,501
 GODDAMN IT, REECE

835
00:52:01,567 --> 00:52:03,100
 I TOLD YOU I DIDN'T
WANT TO HEAR YOU

836
00:52:03,167 --> 00:52:04,000
CALLING HIM
 ANY OF THAT SHIT.

837
00:52:04,067 --> 00:52:05,033
 WATCH OUT.

838
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:07,000
 WHAT?

839
00:52:07,067 --> 00:52:09,601
 WHAT YOU
 ALMOST STEPPED IN.

840
00:52:09,667 --> 00:52:13,501
[Casper]
 JESUS CHRIST!

841
00:52:13,567 --> 00:52:16,868
LOOK AT THEM
 BASTARDS.

842
00:52:16,934 --> 00:52:22,501
 JUST LIKE
A STEEL PUSSY.

843
00:52:22,567 --> 00:52:26,901
WHAT KIND OF WOMEN
YOU BEEN HANGING OUT WITH?

844
00:52:26,968 --> 00:52:29,701
 ALL LAID OUT.
 SEVEN OF THEM.

845
00:52:29,767 --> 00:52:31,100
LIKE THE RABBITS.

846
00:52:31,167 --> 00:52:32,934
 THERE WERE 8 RABBITS.

847
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,267
THEN HOW COME THERE'S
ONLY 7 OF THESE?

848
00:52:35,334 --> 00:52:37,067
DID WE LOSE
ANYBODY?

849
00:52:37,133 --> 00:52:38,734
 THEY WERE
SET FOR US?

850
00:52:38,801 --> 00:52:40,767
 EITHER US,
OR THE LAST SEVEN BEARS

851
00:52:40,834 --> 00:52:42,100
 IN THE STATE OF LOUISIANA.

852
00:52:42,167 --> 00:52:43,734
 HEY.

853
00:52:43,801 --> 00:52:50,300
[Speaking French]

854
00:52:50,367 --> 00:52:52,133
 WHAT'D YOU
 ASK HIM?

855
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,300
I ASKED HIM WHAT
 THEY WERE DOING THERE.

856
00:52:54,367 --> 00:52:55,868
 YOU SON OF A BITCH,
 ARE THERE ANY MORE?

857
00:52:55,934 --> 00:52:57,834
 HUH? HUH?

858
00:52:57,901 --> 00:52:59,801
 I'M TALKING TO YOU!

859
00:52:59,868 --> 00:53:01,501
 REECE, CUT IT OUT.
 COME ON, KNOCK IT OFF.

860
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:03,300
 NOW, LOOK.

861
00:53:03,367 --> 00:53:05,000
 THEY DIDN'T GET US
 AND THEY'RE NOT GONNA.

862
00:53:05,067 --> 00:53:06,834
LET'S SADDLE UP.
WE'RE WASTING TIME.

863
00:53:06,901 --> 00:53:08,601
THE INTERSTATE
AIN'T THAT FAR.

864
00:53:08,667 --> 00:53:10,901
 NOW, LET'S MOVE OUT.
 CRIBBS, YOU TAKE POINT.

865
00:53:10,968 --> 00:53:18,501
COME ON, TYRONE!

866
00:53:18,567 --> 00:53:20,834
 DAMN, CASPER,
 I DON'T SEE WHY I'M POINT.

867
00:53:20,901 --> 00:53:23,200
 I DON'T KNOW
 WHERE THE HIGHWAY IS.

868
00:53:23,267 --> 00:53:25,367
 YOU'RE ALWAYS
 TALKING LIKE YOU KNOW.

869
00:53:25,434 --> 00:53:27,234
 WHY DON'T YOU
 COME UP HERE AND BE POINT?

870
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:28,701
[Casper]
 NO UNNECESSARY NOISE

871
00:53:28,767 --> 00:53:29,767
 AND NO TALKING IN FORMATION.

872
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:47,167
 ARGH!

873
00:53:47,234 --> 00:53:51,501
 CRIBBS!

874
00:53:51,567 --> 00:53:56,367
 JESUS CHRIST, CRIBBS!

875
00:53:56,434 --> 00:53:59,067
[Bowden]
 OUR FATHER, WHO ART IN HEAVEN,

876
00:53:59,133 --> 00:54:02,100
 HALLOWED BE THY NAME

877
00:54:02,167 --> 00:54:06,100
THY KINGDOM COME,
THY WILL BE DONE

878
00:54:06,167 --> 00:54:09,133
 ON EARTH AS IT IS IN HEAVEN.

879
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,901
GIVE US THIS DAY
OUR DAILY BREAD.

880
00:54:12,968 --> 00:54:16,467
 AND FORGIVE US
 OUR TRESPASSES

881
00:54:16,534 --> 00:54:20,934
 AS WE FORGIVE THOSE
WHO TRESPASS AGAINST US.

882
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,501
 LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION

883
00:54:23,567 --> 00:54:25,634
BUT DELIVER US FROM EVIL.

884
00:54:25,701 --> 00:54:30,334
 FOR THINE IS THE KINGDOM...

885
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,701
 FOR THINE IS THE KINGDOM...

886
00:54:33,767 --> 00:54:38,400
 THINE IS THE KINGDOM...

887
00:54:38,467 --> 00:54:40,167
 AND THE POWER
 AND THE GLORY,

888
00:54:40,234 --> 00:54:47,634
 FOREVER. AMEN.

889
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:50,267
WE GIVE THIS PRAYER
AS DEAD MEN

890
00:54:50,334 --> 00:54:53,367
ASKING FOR
OUR SALVATION.

891
00:54:53,434 --> 00:54:56,767
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANY
 MORE OF THAT KIND OF TALK.

892
00:54:56,834 --> 00:55:00,000
 NOW, WE'RE AT WAR,
 AND THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT.

893
00:55:00,067 --> 00:55:01,567
I WANT YOU TO START
LOOKING LIKE SOLDIERS

894
00:55:01,634 --> 00:55:03,000
AND NOT LIKE MAILMEN.

895
00:55:03,067 --> 00:55:05,834
WEAPONS CARRIED
AT THE READY.

896
00:55:05,901 --> 00:55:08,400
NOW, WE'VE ONLY GOT ABOUT
 A HALF HOUR OF DAYLIGHT LEFT.

897
00:55:08,467 --> 00:55:11,601
 SO, THIS IS IT.
 WE'LL BIVOUAC HERE.

898
00:55:11,667 --> 00:55:13,801
 A CLEARING THIS BIG
 WILL MAKE IT TOUGH

899
00:55:13,868 --> 00:55:17,767
 FOR THOSE BASTARDS
 TO COME SNEAK UP ON US.

900
00:55:17,834 --> 00:55:22,400
 ALL RIGHT.
 CASPER, WAIT A SECOND.

901
00:55:22,467 --> 00:55:25,267
 LET'S TALK
 A FEW THINGS OVER.

902
00:55:25,334 --> 00:55:26,834
TOMORROW MORNING,

903
00:55:26,901 --> 00:55:28,334
 HELICOPTERS WILL BE
LOOKING FOR US.

904
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,167
 GOOD CHANCE
 THEY'LL FIND US,

905
00:55:30,234 --> 00:55:31,968
 IF WE STAY
 IN CLEAR GROUND LIKE THIS.

906
00:55:32,033 --> 00:55:33,501
 SO, ALL WE HAVE TO
 WORRY ABOUT UNTIL THEN

907
00:55:33,567 --> 00:55:35,067
 IS THE CAJUNS, RIGHT?

908
00:55:35,133 --> 00:55:36,901
WE DON'T KNOW
THE ENEMY'S STRENGTH

909
00:55:36,968 --> 00:55:38,968
OR HIS DISPOSITION.

910
00:55:39,033 --> 00:55:41,467
HE MAY HAVE THE ADVANTAGE
OF FAMILIAR TERRAIN

911
00:55:41,534 --> 00:55:43,801
BUT WE HAVE THE ADVANTAGE
OF MILITARY TRAINING.

912
00:55:43,868 --> 00:55:45,534
 THAT'S A TERRIFIC SPEECH,

913
00:55:45,601 --> 00:55:47,434
BUT I WANT TO IMPROVE
 OUR ODDS A BIT.

914
00:55:47,501 --> 00:55:50,133
 WHAT ARE YOU
 GOING AFTER, SPENCER?

915
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:52,400
 [Spencer] MAYBE THEY WANT
THIS TRAPPER BACK.

916
00:55:52,467 --> 00:55:53,968
 MAYBE HE'S ALL
 THEY WANT.

917
00:55:54,067 --> 00:55:56,234
 LET'S TAKE THE CHANCE
 AND LET HIM GO.

918
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:58,634
THAT MAN KILLED POOLE.

919
00:55:58,701 --> 00:56:00,701
THE ONLY PLACE HE'S GOING
IS WITH US.

920
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:02,567
 WE DON'T KNOW
 THAT HE KILLED POOLE.

921
00:56:02,634 --> 00:56:03,934
 HE'S JUST THE FIRST CAJUN
 WE RAN INTO.

922
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,467
SPENCER,

923
00:56:06,534 --> 00:56:07,934
YOU KNOW
 THEY'RE FIXING TO KILL US ALL.

924
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,601
 YOU GOT IT.

925
00:56:09,667 --> 00:56:11,968
LOOK, I'M TIRED OF HEARING
ABOUT ALL THIS.

926
00:56:12,033 --> 00:56:13,634
REECE, YOU AND STUCKEY
GAG THE PRISONER

927
00:56:13,701 --> 00:56:15,601
AND TIE HIM TO A TREE.

928
00:56:15,667 --> 00:56:20,133
SIMMS, GO ON SENTRY.

929
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:25,267
 CASPER,
 YOU'RE A DUMB ASSHOLE!

930
00:56:25,334 --> 00:56:28,300
 YOU LISTEN TO ME, SPENCER,
 AND YOU LISTEN REAL GOOD.

931
00:56:28,367 --> 00:56:30,334
 NOW, TOMORROW MORNING,

932
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,501
 WE'RE HEADING NORTH
 WITH THE PRISONER.

933
00:56:32,567 --> 00:56:34,634
THE MAN WHO KILLED POOLE.

934
00:56:34,701 --> 00:56:37,534
 THE MAN WHOSE BUDDIES
 KILLED TYRONE CRIBBS.

935
00:56:37,601 --> 00:56:39,467
IN CASE YOU'VE FORGOTTEN,
SPENCER,

936
00:56:39,534 --> 00:56:44,934
THEY WERE FRIENDS OF OURS.

937
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,167
NOW, LET'S ALL GET UNPACKED
AND BEDDED DOWN.

938
00:56:48,234 --> 00:56:48,968
 NO FIRE TONIGHT.

939
00:57:27,667 --> 00:57:29,300
YOU ALL RIGHT?

940
00:57:29,367 --> 00:57:33,000
 YEAH, I'M OKAY.

941
00:57:33,067 --> 00:57:37,834
YOU KNOW, YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT
ABOUT THE TRAPPER.

942
00:57:37,901 --> 00:57:40,200
 WHY THE HELL
 DIDN'T YOU SAY ANYTHING?

943
00:57:40,267 --> 00:57:42,200
MAYBE I CAN'T BELIEVE
ANY OF THIS SHIT, THAT'S WHY.

944
00:57:42,267 --> 00:57:43,934
HUH.

945
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,367
WELL, LET ME KNOW
 WHEN YOU START.

946
00:57:46,434 --> 00:57:48,267
LOOK, THE PROBLEM ISN'T
WHAT THE HELL I BELIEVE IN

947
00:57:48,334 --> 00:57:50,000
OR DON'T BELIEVE IN.

948
00:57:50,067 --> 00:57:52,367
 WELL, WHAT IS?

949
00:57:52,434 --> 00:57:54,267
HOW LONG
WE'RE GONNA FOLLOW

950
00:57:54,334 --> 00:57:55,701
THIS DUMB BASTARD
CASPER.

951
00:57:55,767 --> 00:57:57,400
LOOKS TO ME

952
00:57:57,467 --> 00:57:59,667
LIKE HE'S LEADING US
AROUND IN CIRCLES.

953
00:57:59,734 --> 00:58:02,400
 AND?

954
00:58:02,467 --> 00:58:05,701
MAYBE WE NEED
A NEW LEADER.

955
00:58:05,767 --> 00:58:08,367
 YOU VOLUNTEERING
 FOR THE JOB?

956
00:58:08,434 --> 00:58:11,667
I'M THE NEW BOY,
 REMEMBER?

957
00:58:11,734 --> 00:58:15,200
YOU KNOW THESE GUYS.
IT'S YOUR MOVE.

958
00:58:15,267 --> 00:58:17,067
BESIDES, I'M NOT
THE VOLUNTEERING TYPE.

959
00:58:17,133 --> 00:58:19,367
 HA! HA! HA!

960
00:58:19,434 --> 00:58:21,868
YOU'RE TERRIFIC, HARDIN.

961
00:58:21,934 --> 00:58:24,234
YOU DON'T WANT TO VOLUNTEER,
BUT YOU DON'T MIND

962
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:29,767
VOLUNTEERING ME
 FOR THE COURT-MARTIAL.

963
00:58:29,834 --> 00:58:30,601
FUCK YOU.

964
00:58:44,601 --> 00:58:46,000
 I GOT SOMETHING
 TO TELL YOU, CASPER.

965
00:58:46,067 --> 00:58:47,200
 FRAGMENTATION.

966
00:58:47,267 --> 00:58:51,601
 WHAT?

967
00:58:51,667 --> 00:58:55,868
 REMEMBER, YOU'RE TRAINING.
 I'M MAKING A GRENADE HERE.

968
00:58:55,934 --> 00:58:57,601
 SEE, EVEN BLANK ROUNDS
 CAN SAVE YOUR LIFE,

969
00:58:57,667 --> 00:58:59,234
IF YOU IMPROVISE.

970
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:00,801
DAMN IT,
DON'T GIVE ME THIS CRAP.

971
00:59:00,868 --> 00:59:02,000
 THIS IS IMPORTANT.

972
00:59:02,067 --> 00:59:03,767
 IT'S BOWDEN.

973
00:59:03,834 --> 00:59:06,834
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG.
HE WON'T TALK.

974
00:59:06,901 --> 00:59:09,501
 SPENCER SAYS
 HE'S JUST GONE TOTALLY CRAZY.

975
00:59:09,567 --> 00:59:12,033
YOU BETTER COME OVER,
I THINK HE'S RIGHT.

976
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:12,767
COME ON.

977
00:59:33,434 --> 00:59:35,901
[Casper]
 LOOK, BOWDEN.

978
00:59:35,968 --> 00:59:37,934
 NOW, IT'S BEEN KIND OF
 ROUGH ON ALL OF US.

979
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,367
 I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE
 NOT FEELING TOO GOOD.

980
00:59:41,434 --> 00:59:46,968
 WHY DON'T YOU
 TALK TO US ABOUT IT?

981
00:59:47,067 --> 00:59:48,000
 COME ON,
BOWDEN.

982
00:59:58,434 --> 01:00:00,267
 BOWDEN, I'M GIVING
 YOU AN ORDER.

983
01:00:00,334 --> 01:00:01,267
NOW, DAMN IT,
 TALK TO US!

984
01:00:10,167 --> 01:00:11,601
 HELL, I DON'T KNOW.

985
01:00:11,667 --> 01:00:13,434
 I DO.

986
01:00:13,501 --> 01:00:17,767
 THE MOTHERFUCKER'S CRAZY.

987
01:00:17,834 --> 01:00:21,100
 WHAT ARE WE
 GONNA DO WITH HIM?

988
01:00:21,167 --> 01:00:22,968
LEAVE HIM THERE.

989
01:00:23,033 --> 01:00:24,267
 MAYBE HE'LL BE BETTER
 IN THE MORNING.

990
01:00:24,334 --> 01:00:26,300
THE HELL WE ARE.

991
01:00:26,367 --> 01:00:28,534
THIS GUY MADE HIS OWN BOMB,
 REMEMBER?

992
01:00:28,601 --> 01:00:30,601
YOU'RE GONNA TIE HIM UP.

993
01:00:30,667 --> 01:00:32,701
 WE DON'T WANT HIM UP
 WHILE WE'RE SLEEPING.

994
01:00:32,767 --> 01:00:34,434
 HE'S WAY TOO BIG
 AND DANGEROUS.

995
01:00:34,501 --> 01:00:35,834
 USE YOUR HEAD, CASPER.

996
01:00:35,901 --> 01:00:38,801
 HE'S RIGHT.

997
01:00:38,868 --> 01:00:40,934
 [Simms]
 HE IS, CASPER. WHAT THE HELL?

998
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,834
[Reece] WON'T HURT NOTHING
TO TIE HIM UP.

999
01:00:42,901 --> 01:00:46,434
 AIN'T NO GOOD TO US, ANYHOW.

1000
01:00:46,501 --> 01:00:48,968
 NEVER WAS,
 AS FAR AS THAT GOES.

1001
01:00:49,033 --> 01:00:52,000
 IF HE'S TIED UP,
WE LOSE POTENTIAL FIREPOWER.

1002
01:00:52,067 --> 01:00:54,234
 JESUS CHRIST, CASPER,
 GET A GODDAMN ROPE

1003
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:56,067
 AND QUIT JERKING OFF
 ABOUT FIREPOWER.

1004
01:00:56,133 --> 01:00:58,701
REMEMBER THE LAST TIME
YOU MOUTHED OFF TO ME?

1005
01:00:58,767 --> 01:01:07,534
BULLSHIT, CASPER.
 THIS AIN'T A GODDAMN GAME.

1006
01:01:07,601 --> 01:01:10,501
ALL RIGHT, THERE'S 40 FEET
 OF ROPE IN MY PACK.

1007
01:01:10,567 --> 01:01:11,434
GO GET IT, SIMMS.

1008
01:02:17,901 --> 01:02:20,200
 WHAT THE HELL
 ARE YOU DOING, REECE?

1009
01:02:20,267 --> 01:02:25,200
 THIS MAN'S GONNA TALK TO ME.

1010
01:02:25,267 --> 01:02:27,300
 LET HIM UP.

1011
01:02:27,367 --> 01:02:30,367
 YOU STAY OUT OF THIS.

1012
01:02:30,434 --> 01:02:33,467
 I SAID, LET HIM UP.

1013
01:02:33,534 --> 01:02:36,267
 SURE.

1014
01:02:36,334 --> 01:02:43,901
NOW YOU HAPPY?

1015
01:02:43,968 --> 01:02:46,734
 THAT'S THE SECOND TIME
 YOU ASKED FOR IT WITH ME.

1016
01:02:46,801 --> 01:02:49,634
 THIS TIME YOU'RE
 GONNA GET AN ANSWER.

1017
01:02:49,701 --> 01:02:52,467
 ABOUT TIME
I PAID YOU OFF, COWBOY.

1018
01:02:52,534 --> 01:02:56,300
HOW ABOUT I BLOW
YOUR FUCKING HEAD OFF, REECE?

1019
01:02:56,367 --> 01:03:04,434
YOU AIN'T GOT THE BALLS.

1020
01:03:04,501 --> 01:03:05,567
 OKAY, YOU GOT IT.

1021
01:03:29,267 --> 01:03:36,934
 [Speaking Cajun French]

1022
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:42,200
 [Speaking Cajun French]

1023
01:03:42,267 --> 01:03:43,200
 [Speaking Cajun French]

1024
01:03:58,667 --> 01:04:00,801
KILL HIM!

1025
01:04:00,868 --> 01:04:02,501
KILL HIM!

1026
01:04:02,567 --> 01:04:03,133
 ARGH!

1027
01:04:18,634 --> 01:04:21,567
 HE'S DEAD.

1028
01:04:21,634 --> 01:04:25,367
 REECE IS DEAD.

1029
01:04:25,434 --> 01:04:30,334
LOOKS LIKE YOUR PRISONER
GOT AWAY, CASPER.

1030
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,901
 [Stuckey]
LONNIE!

1031
01:04:32,968 --> 01:04:36,567
 LET ME GO,
 GODDAMN IT!

1032
01:04:36,634 --> 01:04:38,534
 I'M GONNA GET YOU,
 YOU SON OF A BITCH.

1033
01:04:38,601 --> 01:04:39,801
 YOU HEAR ME?
 I'M GONNA GET YOU!

1034
01:04:58,100 --> 01:04:59,601
 HOW MANY MORE GRAVES

1035
01:04:59,667 --> 01:05:01,634
WILL WE BE LEAVING HERE?

1036
01:05:01,701 --> 01:05:03,234
 NO MORE OF OURS,
I CAN TELL YOU.

1037
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:06,868
 YOU CAN TELL ME THAT.

1038
01:05:06,934 --> 01:05:08,567
SHUT UP!

1039
01:05:08,634 --> 01:05:10,767
 YOU TALKING TO ME?

1040
01:05:10,834 --> 01:05:13,767
I'M TALKING TO EVERYBODY,
INCLUDING YOU.

1041
01:05:13,834 --> 01:05:16,200
 KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT
 AND DIG THE GRAVE.

1042
01:05:16,267 --> 01:05:17,934
WHY DON'T YOU DIG IT?

1043
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,267
 YOU'RE THE ONE
 THAT KILLED HIM!

1044
01:05:20,334 --> 01:05:22,601
 I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU AGAIN.
 KEEP YOUR FUCKING MOUTH SHUT

1045
01:05:22,667 --> 01:05:25,267
 AND DIG THAT GODDAMN GRAVE.

1046
01:05:25,334 --> 01:05:34,000
 I DON'T WANT TO BLOW
 THE SHIT OUT OF YOU.

1047
01:05:34,067 --> 01:05:35,667
 LOOK, JUST DO WHAT
 THE HELL HE SAYS.

1048
01:05:35,734 --> 01:05:43,467
 DIG.

1049

[Thunder]

1050
01:05:52,968 --> 01:05:54,934
 [Casper]
 WE'VE HAD 3 CASUALTIES.

1051
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,601
WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE
 ANY MORE.

1052
01:05:56,667 --> 01:05:59,901
 SURVIVAL IS A MENTAL OUTLOOK.

1053
01:05:59,968 --> 01:06:02,300
NOW, IF YOU'RE NOT PREPARED
 MENTALLY TO OVERCOME

1054
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:04,367
 ALL OBSTACLES AND HARDSHIPS

1055
01:06:04,434 --> 01:06:07,334
 THE CHANCES
OF YOUR COMING OUT ALIVE

1056
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,367
 ARE GREATLY REDUCED.

1057
01:06:09,434 --> 01:06:11,033
WE'RE GETTING TIRED

1058
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:12,934
OF LISTENING
TO ALL THIS, CASPER.

1059
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,567
 GODDAMN YOU, SPENCER,
I'M TRYING TO DO MY BEST!

1060
01:06:15,634 --> 01:06:18,267
I KNOW YOU ARE,
CASPER.

1061
01:06:18,334 --> 01:06:21,901
BUT QUOTING THE MANUAL
ISN'T HELPING MUCH.

1062
01:06:21,968 --> 01:06:23,300
 YOU THINK YOU COULD
 DO ANY BETTER?

1063
01:06:23,367 --> 01:06:24,734
 YEAH, I DO.

1064
01:06:24,801 --> 01:06:27,067
 BUT I'M
THE TEAM LEADER.

1065
01:06:27,133 --> 01:06:30,968
YOU'RE NOT EVEN A CORPORAL,
 YOU'RE JUST A P.F.C.!

1066
01:06:31,033 --> 01:06:34,067
 I'M GETTING TIRED
OF THIS DAMN CRAP.

1067
01:06:34,133 --> 01:06:36,033
I'M WITH YOU,
SPENCER.

1068
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:37,667
CASPER, YOU ARE
NEVER GONNA FIND

1069
01:06:37,734 --> 01:06:41,000
THAT FUCKING HIGHWAY.

1070
01:06:41,067 --> 01:06:42,968
CASPER.

1071
01:06:43,033 --> 01:06:45,033
DO YOU PROMISE ME

1072
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:48,033
THAT THIS TEXAS ASSHOLE'S
GONNA BE COURT-MARTIALED?

1073
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:49,801
 HE'S GOT TO BE.

1074
01:06:49,868 --> 01:06:52,968
 HE KILLED
 A FELLOW SOLDIER.

1075
01:06:53,033 --> 01:06:56,133
THEN I'M WITH YOU.

1076
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:58,734
HARDIN.

1077
01:06:58,801 --> 01:07:00,801
 WHAT'S THIS VOTING BULLSHIT?

1078
01:07:00,868 --> 01:07:05,567
LET'S GET MOVING.

1079
01:07:05,634 --> 01:07:10,033
[Spencer]
 COME ON, BOWDEN. LET'S GO HOME.

1080
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:12,734
SPENCER, YOU JUST CAN'T
WALK OFF LIKE THIS!

1081
01:07:12,801 --> 01:07:14,601
 WE'RE A SQUAD, A UNIT!

1082
01:07:14,667 --> 01:07:17,400
 WE'RE "BRAVO TEAM."

1083
01:07:17,467 --> 01:07:19,200
YOU GUYS ARE DESERTING.

1084
01:07:19,267 --> 01:07:22,834
YOU BET YOUR ASS
 WE ARE.

1085
01:07:22,901 --> 01:07:26,167
 YOU COMING?

1086
01:07:26,234 --> 01:07:27,400
 COME ON, STUCKEY,
 LET'S GO.

1087
01:07:58,467 --> 01:08:00,434
 [Spencer] HOW'S
 YOUR ARM?

1088
01:08:00,501 --> 01:08:03,968
[Bowden] IT'LL BE
 ALL RIGHT.

1089
01:08:04,033 --> 01:08:06,834
[Spencer] LOOK, FOR WHAT
IT'S WORTH,

1090
01:08:06,901 --> 01:08:10,033
I KNOW REECE WAS
 A REAL SON OF A BITCH.

1091
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:12,968
[Bowden] I DON'T WANT TO
 TALK ABOUT HIM.

1092
01:08:13,033 --> 01:08:15,434
 [Spencer] YEAH, WELL,
 MAYBE IT WAS SELF-DEFENSE.

1093
01:08:15,501 --> 01:08:18,501
 [Bowden] LOOK,
 LET'S JUST DROP IT.

1094
01:08:18,567 --> 01:08:22,501
 IT'S OVER WITH.

1095
01:08:22,567 --> 01:08:24,901
 RIGHT.

1096
01:08:24,968 --> 01:08:26,734
 [Simms]
 HEY, SPENCER,

1097
01:08:26,801 --> 01:08:29,267
 WHAT CHANCE
 DO WE GOT?

1098
01:08:29,334 --> 01:08:31,734
 YOU WERE ALWAYS
 SO SMART ABOUT EVERYTHING.

1099
01:08:31,801 --> 01:08:33,467
 NOW YOU'RE
 THE LEADER.

1100
01:08:33,534 --> 01:08:35,267
 SO GIVE ME AN ANSWER.

1101
01:08:35,334 --> 01:08:36,701

 WELL, THEY GOT STATE TROOPERS,

1102
01:08:36,767 --> 01:08:38,434
HELICOPTERS, HOUND DOGS.

 EVERYONE IN LOUISIANA
 LOOKING FOR US.

1104
01:08:40,133 --> 01:08:41,834
 [Simms] I TELL YOU, SPENCER,

1105
01:08:41,901 --> 01:08:43,734
 I'VE HAD IT
 WITH THEM HOUND DOGS.

1106
01:08:43,801 --> 01:08:46,033
 I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE,

1107
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:47,767
WHOEVER'S LOOKING FOR US,
 THEY BETTER MAKE IT QUICK.
