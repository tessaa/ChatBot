00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,481
My firm has reason to believe
more than one innocent man

160
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:43,066
has gone down without a fight.

161
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,152
Oh, I get it.

162
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:47,321
You're an idealist.

163
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:49,656
No. I'm a pacifist.

164
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,241
It's a noble crusade.

165
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:55,245
But this is not the fight. Trust me.
James Barr's guilty.

166
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:57,205
You haven't even seen the evidence.

167
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:03,253
Is this a privileged conversation?

168
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:07,090
Of course, it's a client conference.
Nothing you say here can be repeated.

169
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,845
There are four types of people
who join the military.

170
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,722
For some, it's a family trade.

171
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,558
Others are patriots, eager to serve.

172
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,894
Next, you have those
who just need a job.

173
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:23,398
Then there's the kind who want a legal
means of killing other people.

174
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,734
James Barr was one of those.

175
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:28,070
He made sniper.

176
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:31,406
Trained hard.
Two thousand rounds a week.

177
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:33,825
And with every shot,
he's taught to visualise

178
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,536
the base of a man's skull
through his reticle.

179
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:39,581
The sweet spot where
the medulla meets the spine.

180
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,251
Visualise that puff of pink mist.

181
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:44,711
(CLICKS)

182
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:46,922
Finally, he's deployed to Iraq.

183
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,924
He's put on overwatch.

184
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,427
All day long
he stares through a scope at civilians.

185
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:54,262
Women.

186
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:55,639
Children.

187
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:58,767
Day in, day out, for two long years

188
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:01,895
without ever once being
cleared to fire a single shot.

189
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,773
Then comes the drawdown.

190
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,401
For James Barr, the war's over.

191
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,278
Two thousand rounds a week.

192
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:14,241
A quarter million rounds in his career,
not one at a human target.

193
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:17,619
You've been hungry.
You've been horny.

194
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:20,288
You've had an itch you can't scratch.

195
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:24,793
Imagine that feeling.
Days. Weeks. Years.

196
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:29,131
Imagine that feeling times 200,000,
plus 50,000 more.

197
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:33,343
Imagine it's 130 degrees on the deck
and tomorrow you're going home

198
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,429
and you know if you don't
scratch that itch now,

199
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:37,139
you never will.

200
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,141
You need a release.

201
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:41,309
You need a target.

202
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:44,604
And the who of it
never once enters your mind.

203
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:55,782
(FIRING)

204
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:03,832
He covered his tracks well,

205
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,625
just like sane people do.

206
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:10,881
He almost got away with it, too.
But I caught him. And he confessed.

207
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:12,716
So why didn't he go to prison?

208
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:17,179
What Barr didn't know that day was the
four civilian contractors he'd picked off

209
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:20,557
just spent the weekend
at what they call a rape-rally.

210
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:24,728
It was 28 women,
ages 54 on down to 11.

211
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:28,815
Those were just the ones I could find
before the case was shut down.

212
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,985
See, the deeper I dug, the uglier it got.

213
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,655
And after seven long years
of "Mission Accomplished,"

214
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:39,326
someone in the corporation just wanted
the whole thing to end quietly.

215
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:43,330
So they chalked it up to the fog of war,
made the murders go away.

216
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,749
This is classified information.

217
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:48,835
And that's why the privilege.

218
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,171
But you were ready
to tell this to the D.A.

219
00:18:51,506 --> 00:18:55,217
The last time I saw Barr,
I made him a promise.

220
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:59,179
And when I saw his name on the news,
I came here to keep it.

221
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:03,058
- But now I know I don't have to.
- How can you be sure?

222
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,685
You still haven't seen the evidence.

223
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:09,731
Your father has.
And he doesn't pick a fight he can't win.

224
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,400
Barr's not getting away
with murder again.

225
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,361
He might.

226
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:18,240
He suffered a severe brain injury
in state custody.

227
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,116
When he wakes up, if he wakes up,

228
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:22,953
he may not remember the event,
he may not remember anything at all.

229
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:27,749
And this case won't be about
James Barr's guilt or innocence.

230
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:31,086
It'll be about his ability to stand trial.

231
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:36,383
After everything I just told you,
you still want to defend him?

232
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,552
I want to see he gets a fair trial.

233
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:43,265
You said he confessed in Baghdad.

234
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:45,433
He didn't confess this time.

235
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,811
- This time he knows better.
- This time he asked for you.

236
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,189
I want to know why.

237
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:54,317
You want to know why.
I can see it's eating you.

238
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,986
And you can't ask Barr,

239
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:58,446
and the D.A. Won't let you
see the evidence.

240
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:04,452
My lead investigator has complete
access to the evidence. All of it.

241
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:09,332
- So where's your lead investigator?
- About to catch a bus out of town.

242
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:20,010
Thanks for the coffee, counsellor.

243
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:54,544
(EXHALES)

244
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:18,860
You understand you're not just
asking me to look at the evidence.

245
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:21,738
You're asking me to look
at a cold-blooded killer.

246
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:25,367
A man I know to be guilty.
A man you want to keep off death row.

247
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:28,328
And you're asking me
to look at him objectively.

248
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,373
Yes, that is what I'm asking.

249
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:38,880
I'll do it. On one condition.

250
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:40,882
Name it.

251
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:45,387
You have to look
at the victims objectively.

252
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,392
How do you suggest I do that?

253
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:51,476
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

254
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,730
- Yes?
- Mr Farrior?

255
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:57,899
I'm Helen Rodin.
We spoke on the phone.

256
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:00,235
Of course.

257
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,904
You said you're defending
the man that ki...

258
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,572
That man.

259
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:08,076
HELEN: I represent James Barr, yes.

260
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:11,246
FARRIOR: And you have questions
about my daughter?

261
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:13,415
HELEN: I do.

262
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:16,584
FARRIOR: What for?

263
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:20,755
I was hoping to get a better sense
of who the victims were as...

264
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:22,841
That is to say, who they were as people.

265
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:24,718
- As human beings.
- (SCOFFS)

266
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:33,101
That's a bit unusual,
considering your position, isn't it?

267
00:22:33,436 --> 00:22:34,436
That is true.

268
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:38,273
Normally someone in my position
would want the jury

269
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:40,775
to know as little as possible about the...

270
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,778
FARRIOR:
The people that your client killed.

271
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,114
In cold blood.

272
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:53,997
Have you spoken
with the other families?

273
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:57,250
Yeah, some.
The ones who would speak with me.

274
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,011
Come in.

275
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:09,471
Thank you.

276
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,758
FARRIOR: Chrissie was a nanny.

277
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:13,052
She had a little girl with her that day.

278
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:14,429
Yes, I know.

279
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:19,767
Are you gonna go talk with that child?

280
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:21,769
No, of course not. I...

281
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:23,938
Why not?

282
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,900
- Well, I think it would be...
- Insensitive?

283
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:29,611
Inappropriate?

284
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,783
Everything that you want to know
about my daughter

285
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,120
is right here.

286
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,458
The Gazette did a nice piece on her.

287
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:47,921
Her obituary does the rest.

288
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:54,594
Thank you. I'll definitely have a look.

289

You a good attorney, Miss Rodin?

290
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,642
- That's not really for me to...
- Just

291
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,435
answer the question.

292
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:06,981
Yes, I suppose I am pretty good.

293
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:09,150
Good enough to keep
that man off death row?

294
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:11,653
You know,

295
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,446
I think maybe I should go.

296
00:26:13,656 --> 00:26:15,156
You stay where you are.

297
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:22,830
That man deserves to die, Miss Rodin.

298
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:28,127
Why would you defend him?

299
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:31,339
I can see
that I have made a terrible mistake.

300
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:36,511
And I'm very, very sorry
and I promise I won't bother you again.

00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,274
Hello, Dad.

What the hell are you doing?

304
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,360
What am I... What?

305
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:53,528
Is it true?

306
00:26:53,696 --> 00:26:55,697
You're talking to the victims' families?
You? Alone?

307
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:58,741
How do you know that?
How did you find me here?

308
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,119
I'm the District Attorney.
It's my business to know.

309
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:02,245
That's not an answer.

310
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:06,541
Oh. Well, you're not the only one
with crack investigators, Helen.

311
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,377
That's right. I know about Reacher.

312
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:12,046
Your lead investigator is a war veteran

313
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,716
who's been missing
for the last two years.

314
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:17,635
How can you vouch
for his state of mind?

315
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,053
How can you trust anything he tells you?

316
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,388
You don't know the man.

317
00:27:21,724 --> 00:27:24,726
Tell me this,
does he know you can't pay him?

318
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,228
That your own firm
didn't want this case?

319
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,564
That nobody wants this case?

320
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:33,526
You never even spoke to your client
before he wound up in a coma.

321
00:27:33,736 --> 00:27:36,237
Oh, now listen to me! Listen.
Listen, I'm speaking as your father.

322
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:38,448
Whatever our differences
have been in the past,

323

you gotta listen to me now.

You're making a terrible mistake.

325

You cannot win this case.

You're going to ruin your career.
Why? For what?

Thanks for letting me take a look.

Hey. We love it
when friends of the accused

331
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:15,068
try to tear our work to shreds.

332
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:16,611
He's not my friend.

333
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:19,781
So you keep saying. Find any holes?

334
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:22,283
Well, you didn't have to
put him in the hospital.

335
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:26,454
Other than that, damn fine police work.
It's open and shut.

336
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,166
What can I say?
The scene was a gold mine.

337
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:33,795
Come on. Now we both know
gold's only as good as the man digging.

338
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:36,798
Yeah, well, anytime you want to come
back, take a look at this stuff...

00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:38,633
No, thanks. Don't need to.

340
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,468
You never took any notes.

in the Army, huh?

00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:50,269
I did all right.

345
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:53,314
So what does an Army cop do mostly?
Break up bar fights?

346
00:28:53,816 --> 00:28:56,818
I did what you do pretty much,
with one minor difference.

347
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:57,985
What's that?

348
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:00,822

349
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:03,116
Thanks again.

350
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:11,165
Why do you think he paid for parking?

351
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:14,794
Pardon?

352
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:18,673
He's about to fire six shots
into a crowd of strangers.

353
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:21,175
And he's worried about the meter maid?

354
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:23,010
"Simple loony" won't do it for you?

355

I like to have
at least one alternate theory.

356

359
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:34,355
I don't think he knew he was doing it.

Hey, Army.

What's the serial number on the rifle?

363
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,120
What's the date on the quarter?

00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,645
HELEN: If someone followed you
at the river today,

479
00:37:52,729 --> 00:37:54,521
it was probably a cop.
And I highly doubt...

480
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,106
There are three things cops never do.

481
00:37:56,358 --> 00:37:58,859
They don't vote Democrat,
they don't drive Cadillacs,

482
00:37:58,944 --> 00:38:01,111
and they never use personal vehicles.

483
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:03,614
It's not a cop.

484
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:05,866
A P.I., then, or the D.A.'s office.

485
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:07,743
You think your father's office
would set me up?

486
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:09,119
Why would anyone set you up?

487
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:10,454
How was your day?

488
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:12,039
It went exactly the way I think

489
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:14,792
you hoped it would.

490
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:17,920
You okay?

491
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:20,089
Mmm-hmm.

492
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:22,800
What'd you learn?

493
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:28,305
HELEN: Chrissie Farrior was 22.

494
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:33,310
A nanny caring for the six-year-old
daughter of family friends.

495
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:37,398
She'd finally saved enough
money for a trip to China,

496
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:39,608
in fact, she should have left
the week before.

497
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:44,154
But the girl she cared for wanted
Chrissie to stay for her 7th birthday.

498
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:48,659
They'd gone downtown that day
to shop for a party dress.

499
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:56,333
Rita Coronado worked as a cleaning
lady at the River Cross Plaza.

500
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:59,920
She was usually late for work,
but she had a good reason.

501
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:02,464
Since her son Marco
was nine years old

502
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:06,552
she had to personally drop him at
school to make sure he actually went.

503
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:08,804
But her dedication had paid off.

504
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,682
Marco was now an honour student.

505
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,976
As a reward for all his hard work,

506
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:16,270
Rita was taking him
to his first baseball game.

507
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:20,315
And she was on her way to pick up
the tickets that very afternoon.

508
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:25,362
Nancy Holt's last words to her husband
were a lie.

509
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:27,281
- I love you, babe. See you!
- Bye.

510
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,199
She told him she was
taking her car to be serviced,

511
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:31,535
but in fact, she was headed downtown.

512
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:35,748
It's perfect.

513
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:38,876
She told the clerk she didn't want the
purchase showing up on her credit card.

514
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:42,129
She wanted to surprise her
husband for their 10th anniversary

515
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,632
- just a few days away.
- Thank you.

516
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:51,221
Oline Archer never liked
her husband's construction business,

517
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:56,060
even after helping him become one of
the largest contractors in the county.

518
00:39:56,561 --> 00:40:00,606
So it came as a relief when
his failing health and a costly lawsuit

519
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:02,483
were forcing them
to sell to the competition.

520
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:03,817
Rob?

521
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:05,694
Help! Help!

522
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:11,325
Her husband
had given his life for the company.

523
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,244
But now that it was hers,

524
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:16,830
she couldn't bring herself to let it go.

525
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,089
She was on her way
to secure a loan that day

526
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:28,425
so she could keep the business
she'd always hated.

527
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,595
Darren Sawyer was
an investment broker

528
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,764
in the same building where Rita worked.

529
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:37,101
His wife said
he'd grown increasingly distant of late.

530
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:42,022
She can't remember their last words
to one another, but they weren't kind.

531
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,691
Darren's body was found beside
a fresh bouquet of roses

532
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:46,777
he'd bought that morning

533
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:50,280
and his wife takes comfort
in the fact that, in his last moments,

534
00:40:50,532 --> 00:40:52,950
he was most likely thinking of her.

535
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:15,013
We're gonna be okay.
We're gonna be okay.

536
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:16,473
We're gonna be okay.

537
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:18,559
We're gonna be okay,
we're gonna be okay,

538
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:20,227
we're gonna be okay,
we're gonna be okay.

539
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:34,241
REACHER: So what'd you learn?

540
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,161
You want me to say you were right.

541
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:39,121
You want me to say
that this isn't the fight.

542
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:41,832
James Barr should die.

543
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:44,459
Maybe he should.

544
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:46,420
I meant, what did you
learn about the victims.

545
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,546
What more do you want?

546
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,840
They were five innocent people
senselessly murdered.

547
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,925
I'm sorry.
Could you please put a shirt on?

548
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,510
This is my shirt.

549
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,096
You lose your luggage?

550
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:57,764
I don't have any luggage.

551
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,684
Uh, what was I saying?

552
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:03,353
- Five innocent people.
- Murdered at random, yes.

553
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,273
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

554
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:09,109
You know how many people
die in this country every year?

555
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:10,777
Two and a half million.

556
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:13,197
That means every day,

557
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:17,117
roughly 7,000 average Americans
wake up for the last time.

558
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:20,495
Last Friday, five of them converged
on a single spot and died together.

559
00:42:20,622 --> 00:42:21,622
Is that random?

560
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:23,123
What else would you call it?

561
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:26,418
Well, take Darren and Nancy.
Odds are they were having an affair.

562
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:27,544
Excuse me?

563
00:42:27,629 --> 00:42:30,339
You don't buy roses
for your wife on the way to work.

564
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:32,132
You buy them on the way home.

565
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:35,802
And you don't worry about a charge
showing up on your credit card

566
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:37,638
when your anniversary is that weekend.

567
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:39,973
Unless it's the gift you're hiding.

568
00:42:43,645 --> 00:42:45,020
And that's why she kept walking

569
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,399
while everyone else ran.

570
00:42:49,651 --> 00:42:50,984
You can't prove that.

571
00:42:51,236 --> 00:42:54,571
How hard would it be?
Cell phones, e-mails.

572
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,659
All it takes is someone willing to dig.

573
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:00,827
What's your point exactly?

574
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:04,414
My point is that two of the victims
weren't there strictly by chance.

575
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,252
I need a list of Barr's known associates.

576
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,504
There isn't one. He didn't have any.

577
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,756
He's a classic loner.
He didn't even talk to his neighbours.

578
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,259
He was a quiet man.
Never bothered anyone.

579
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:16,677
Yeah, exactly.

580
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:19,930
- You have his credit card statement?
- I can get it. Why?

581
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:22,307
I need the list
of all the places he hung out.

582
00:43:22,392 --> 00:43:24,851
Bars, bowling alleys, strip clubs,

583
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:26,770
gun ranges.

584
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:28,647
Anywhere someone
would remember him.

585
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:29,898
What do we hope to find?

586
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:32,192
I need some sleep.

587
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:34,778
You, too.

588
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:36,863
You don't really think I'm gonna...

589
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,622
Be back to pick me up at 7:00.

590
00:43:49,294 --> 00:43:51,378
Yep. Absolutely.

591
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:32,836
Who's with you?

592
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,504
What happened?

593
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,341
Oh, that's him, isn't it?

594
00:44:38,176 --> 00:44:39,509
I ain't seeing you, man!

595
00:44:39,761 --> 00:44:41,428
Relax. What happened?

596
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:45,307
Barr's attorney hired an investigator.

597
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:48,518
Name of Reacher.
Some sort of top-shelf Army cop.

598
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:50,687
He was in Baghdad
the same time as Barr.

599
00:44:51,356 --> 00:44:52,522
So?

600
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:56,360
So Barr asked for this soldier by name.

601
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:59,321
Then he shows up at the river today.
Then up on the highway.

602
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,198
Almost like he knew something.

603
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,701
And you said we don't like
people asking questions.

604
00:45:04,786 --> 00:45:06,203
No, we sure don't.

605
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:07,788
So I took steps.

606
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:10,874
You took steps.

607
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:13,377
Local people. My guys.

608
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,295
And it blew back on you.

609
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:17,923
I figured five guys would do it.

610
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:21,051
Mmm. This franchise
was yours to manage.

611
00:45:21,386 --> 00:45:24,221
That's all. Maintenance is our thing,
you understand?

612
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:25,347
Yeah, I understand. I couldn't reach you!

613
00:45:25,473 --> 00:45:26,473
Well, that's how this works.

614
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:27,891
Well, I had to make a decision!

615
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:30,685
- These locals, I want their names.
- It's in the file.

616
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:31,978
Any of them know who you are?

617
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,147
Just one, but I took care of it.

618
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:36,650
You...

619
00:45:37,402 --> 00:45:39,528
- (SIGHS) Where's the body?
- It's distributed.

620
00:45:39,654 --> 00:45:40,654
(SCOFFS)

621
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:41,780
Relax! No one's gonna find it.

622
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:44,157
- Suppose we want it found, yeah?
- Why the hell would you want it found?

623
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:47,244
'Cause we got a way of doing things
so they stay done.

624
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:49,079
Clean!

625
00:45:49,664 --> 00:45:51,206
A missing person isn't clean.

626
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:53,750
Christ's sakes, man. You only had to kill
one goddamn person.

627
00:45:53,835 --> 00:45:55,252
You tapped five! You call that clean?

628
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:59,506
I call it done. They're looking
at the shooter, not the target.

629
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:00,757
Jesus.

630
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:04,845
We make it messy now
so it won't get messy later.

631
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:08,098
And we don't leave
questions unanswered ever.

632
00:46:08,433 --> 00:46:11,268
Okay, all right. Okay. I can fix this.

633
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:14,020
- MAN: Open your eyes.
- No, I ain't seeing you!

634
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:16,106
MAN: It makes no difference now.

635
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:18,692
(SIGHS)

636
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:27,117
I made a mistake.

637
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:29,870
I mean, you can still use me,
just tell me how to fix...

638
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:33,790
To survive.
Don't say "fix it," because you can't.

639
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:37,127
We covered up the one mess.
You made another.

640
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:38,962
All right. You're right.

641
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:40,547
You're right.
You're absolutely right. I'm sorry.

642
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:43,300
Just tell me what I have to do.

643
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:47,053
I was in prison in Siberia.

644
00:46:47,472 --> 00:46:51,141
I spent my first winter
wearing a dead man's coat.

645
00:46:51,476 --> 00:46:53,643
A hole in one pocket.

646
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:55,979
I chewed these fingers off

647
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:59,149
before the frostbite
could turn to gangrene.

648
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:05,155
These I gave up
to avoid working in the sulphur mine.

649
00:47:06,491 --> 00:47:09,993
That is how I survived
when so many others did not.

650
00:47:11,496 --> 00:47:14,664
A man this rare can always be of use.

651
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,169
So show me. Show me you are rare.

652
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:22,422
Show me you'll do anything to survive.

653
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:25,467
I don't understand.

654
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:28,512
The fingers from your left hand.

655
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:30,138
(SCOFFS)

656
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:57,332
Have you... Have you got a knife?

657
00:47:57,542 --> 00:48:00,126
Did I have a knife in Siberia?

658
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:01,962
(CHUCKLES)

659
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,466
No... Come on, you've got to be kidding.

660
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:08,635
You can do it.

661
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:10,387
Show me.

662
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:26,194
(GROANS)

663
00:48:28,698 --> 00:48:30,490
(EXCLAIMING IN PAIN)

664
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:43,587
Christ!

665
00:48:44,589 --> 00:48:46,881
Can't! I can't.

666
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:49,134
Always the bullet.

667
00:48:49,218 --> 00:48:50,885
- I can't!
- I don't understand.

668
00:48:58,102 --> 00:48:59,769
What do we do about the soldier?

669
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:02,063
What we always do.

670
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:10,822
Barr's credit card statement.
Eyewitness testimonies.

671
00:49:11,449 --> 00:49:14,284
Coffee. You take it black, right?

672
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:22,626
Yeah. What can I say?
I take my work home.

673
00:49:36,432 --> 00:49:39,100
Afraid Barr's credit card
statement's a dead end.

674
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:44,064
No bars, no strip joints, nothing.
Pretty much just gas and groceries.

675
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:49,611
I need you to look for gun ranges
between 100 and 150 miles from here.

676
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:52,656
Limit your search to ranges
longer than 300 yards.

677
00:49:52,782 --> 00:49:54,074
Sure, if you tell me why.

678
00:49:54,158 --> 00:49:56,660
Barr consistently filled
his tank on Saturday,

679
00:49:56,786 --> 00:49:57,994
and again on Sunday.

680
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,621
He took a long drive
almost every weekend.

681
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:02,082
- He could be going anywhere.
- Yes.

682
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,169
And if it's bars, bowling alleys
or strip clubs, we'll never find it.

683
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:09,631
But a Match-level gun range?
There might be two.

684
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:13,510
And he made his own bullets.
That means he shot a lot.

685
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:16,012
I'm guessing every Saturday.

686
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:18,598
Maybe with a friend.

687
00:50:18,808 --> 00:50:21,434
Why is it so important
you talk to his friends?

688
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:22,644
Assuming he had any.

689
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,354
Drop me at the auto parts store.

690
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,314
I... Wait. Which one?

691
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:28,858
I don't know.
She just said "the auto parts store."

692
00:50:28,943 --> 00:50:29,984
She? Who?

693
00:50:30,111 --> 00:50:31,611
Reacher, can you be
a little more specific?

694
00:50:31,696 --> 00:50:34,030
I didn't say "an auto parts store."

695
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:37,659
Which one stands out in your mind
as the auto parts store?

696
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:48,878
HELEN: You want me to wait?

697
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:52,882
- No, I'll meet you back at the office later.
- HELEN: How will you get there?

698
00:50:56,721 --> 00:50:58,179
I'll hitch a ride.

699
00:51:32,548 --> 00:51:33,590
(RINGING)

700
00:51:40,765 --> 00:51:41,931
Can I help you?

701
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:43,308
Sandy work here?

702
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:46,686
What's this about?

703
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:49,939
So she does, thanks.
I need to speak with her.

704
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:51,441
It's a personal matter.

705
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:54,903
- She's on the clock.
- Legal personal matter.

706
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:57,238
What are you, a cop?

707
00:51:58,783 --> 00:52:00,408
Call her out, Gary.

708
00:52:00,743 --> 00:52:03,077
- I'm gonna need to see some I.D.
- Go get Sandy.

709
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:05,622
Well, I need to see something.

710
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:08,750
How about the inside of an ambulance?

711
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:14,756
Okay, I'm calling the police.

712
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:19,469
I don't think Sandy wants
the police involved...

713
00:52:19,595 --> 00:52:20,804
- Hello?
...but let's ask.

714
00:52:21,055 --> 00:52:22,096
Hey! You...

715
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:25,308
Hello? I need some help.
Hello? Hey! You!

716
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:29,354
No. You are not allowed
back in here, man!

717
00:52:35,444 --> 00:52:36,611
Shit.

718
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,324
You know this guy?

719
00:52:41,617 --> 00:52:42,659
Tell him.

720
00:52:43,953 --> 00:52:45,286
Give us a few, Gary.

721
00:52:57,007 --> 00:53:00,051
Listen, I wasn't... I didn't know.

722
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:02,720
I didn't know that was going to happen!

723
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:09,561
It was Jeb.

724
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:12,355
The big guy.

725
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:14,357
Jeb Oliver.

726
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:21,656
He told me you were a predator.
You were supposed to start groping me.

727
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:29,664
Just don't hurt me.

728
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,208
Sandy, sit down.

729
00:53:35,254 --> 00:53:36,337
Where can I find Jeb?

730
00:53:36,881 --> 00:53:38,506
I don't know.
He didn't come to work today.

731
00:53:38,591 --> 00:53:39,883
So he works here.

732
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:41,551
Yeah.

733
00:53:42,887 --> 00:53:45,555
It's bullshit, though. He cooks crystal.

734
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:47,098
His address, write it down.

735
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:51,895
I'm really sorry, mister.

736
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,565
You were supposed to be a pervert.

737
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:59,235
And it was an easy 100 bucks.

738
00:53:59,528 --> 00:54:00,570
That's all?

739
00:54:02,907 --> 00:54:06,701
When Jeb asks, you do what he says.

740
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:12,582
Am I in trouble?

741
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:17,420
Not if you lend me your car.

742
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:20,632
- I don't have a car.
- Well, sure you do. It's outside.

743
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:22,717
I'm guessing you're the Camaro.

744
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:25,720
That whimsy little pickup
has Gary written all over it. Keys?

745
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:28,264
I can't. It's Jeb's car!

746
00:54:28,474 --> 00:54:31,643
Well, won't he be surprised
when I drive it home for him.

747
00:54:38,734 --> 00:54:40,109
Who are you, mister?

748
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:41,778
Really?

749
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:51,245
I'm just a guy
who wants to be left alone.

750
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:53,247
I get off work at six!

751
00:54:56,794 --> 00:54:58,503
Maybe we could...

752
00:54:58,963 --> 00:55:00,630
Sandy, listen.

753
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:04,092
Now, you seem like a sweet girl.

754
00:55:05,094 --> 00:55:06,427
You're pretty.

755
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:08,930

It's just what girls like me do.

759
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:24,779
You got money?

760
00:55:26,115 --> 00:55:27,156
A little.

761
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:29,993
Get out of town for a couple of days.

762
00:55:30,494 --> 00:55:31,536
Why?

763
00:55:33,831 --> 00:55:35,665
Get out of town, Sandy.

I have a warrant to search the premises.

767
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:37,894
I see.

You tell... (CRIES OUT)

The last I saw him,
we was all leaving jail.

his mom woke up from a bender

and his shit's all gone.

793

Is he the sort to light out like that?

794

No, no, man.
He'd never leave his moms alone.

01:00:46,518 --> 01:00:47,560
Keys.

798
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:49,353
My hand, man.
They're in my pock... Aah!

799
01:00:49,521 --> 01:00:50,855
Okay, okay.

800
01:00:57,779 --> 01:00:59,363
Now look at your friends.

801
01:00:59,948 --> 01:01:01,157
Now look at my face.

802
01:01:03,035 --> 01:01:05,202
Do you ever want to see me again?

803
01:01:05,954 --> 01:01:07,038
No way.

804
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:10,041
Am I stealing your car?

805
01:01:10,876 --> 01:01:14,337
Use it as long as you like.

806
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:17,006
You're very kind.

807
01:01:17,257 --> 01:01:18,382
Ah!

808
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:43,949
REACHER: I think Jeb Oliver's dead.

809
01:01:44,493 --> 01:01:47,495
- Who's Jeb Oliver?
- He was the guy from the bar.

810
01:01:49,081 --> 01:01:51,415
Jesus, how hard did you hit him?

811
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:54,585
What? No, not me.

812
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:57,046
No, he was murdered.

813
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:59,006
And someone tried to make it
look like he left town.

814
01:01:59,091 --> 01:02:00,591
Well, maybe he just left town.

815
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:02,343
You pack your shower curtain
when you travel?

816
01:02:02,594 --> 01:02:04,637
Is this what you base
your conclusions on?

817
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:06,514
What is that on your head?

818
01:02:07,808 --> 01:02:08,849
Uh...

819
01:02:13,188 --> 01:02:14,563
You don't want to know.

820
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:19,527
You said on the phone
you wanted to submit your findings.

821
01:02:22,114 --> 01:02:25,449
James Barr was a sniper.
Not the best, not the worst.

822
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,451
But he trained non-stop for two years.

823
01:02:27,536 --> 01:02:28,786
What does training like that do?

824
01:02:28,954 --> 01:02:30,830
What does any training do?

825
01:02:30,914 --> 01:02:33,791
Skills become reflex. Muscle memory.
You do without thinking.

826
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:37,461
It also makes people who aren't
necessarily smart seem smart

827
01:02:37,712 --> 01:02:39,964
by beating some
tactical awareness into them.

828
01:02:40,215 --> 01:02:42,466
Now, 99% of the evidence
your father has against Barr

829
01:02:42,551 --> 01:02:44,135
didn't exist in Baghdad,

830
01:02:44,219 --> 01:02:47,179
not because Barr was smart,
but because he was trained.

831
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:51,392
See, from that garage,
the shooter had the sun in his eyes.

832
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:54,645
Targets were moving left and right.
It's difficult conditions for any sniper.

833
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:57,398
But Baghdad, you said Barr
was in a parking garage then.

834
01:02:57,482 --> 01:03:00,192
Because in Baghdad,
the sun's behind him.

835
01:03:00,402 --> 01:03:03,154
Targets coming straight ahead,
single file.

836
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:06,031
Ideal conditions
for even an average shooter

837
01:03:07,075 --> 01:03:08,826
and the exact same conditions

838
01:03:08,994 --> 01:03:11,370
he would've had
up on that highway bridge.

839
01:03:12,247 --> 01:03:15,458
Up there, he would never even
have to get out of the van.

840
01:03:17,002 --> 01:03:18,461
No parking meter.

841
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:19,712
No camera.

842
01:03:20,172 --> 01:03:24,216
No trace evidence left behind.
And his escape is assured.

843
01:03:24,342 --> 01:03:26,010
Now, I'm not saying
that he couldn't have killed

844
01:03:26,094 --> 01:03:28,512
those people at the river,
but he wouldn't have.

845
01:03:28,597 --> 01:03:29,638
Not that way.

846
01:03:29,723 --> 01:03:31,182
- So you're saying he's crazy.
- No.

847
01:03:31,266 --> 01:03:33,267
Well, what exactly are you saying?

848
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:37,021
Any single piece of evidence I'd buy.
But all of it?

849
01:03:37,105 --> 01:03:39,732
Fibres, fingerprints, stray brass,
I mean...

850
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:41,817
And who the hell pays for parking?

851
01:03:42,027 --> 01:03:44,695
Sane or crazy,
that just doesn't make sense.

852
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:49,450
Okay. So Barr, he wanted to get caught
and he wanted you to catch him.

853
01:03:50,285 --> 01:03:52,369
That would not explain how Barr,

854
01:03:53,371 --> 01:03:57,625
an average shooter firing
in poor conditions, never missed.

855
01:03:57,792 --> 01:03:58,959
He did miss.

856
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:00,586
He did.

857
01:04:03,715 --> 01:04:04,924
A pristine bullet,

858
01:04:05,884 --> 01:04:08,344
conveniently trapped
by a liquid backstop.

859
01:04:10,347 --> 01:04:12,890
The same bullet that tied
Barr's gun to the killings.

860
01:04:13,517 --> 01:04:16,852
And arguably the prosecution's single
most important piece of evidence.

861
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:20,564
If Barr wanted to get caught,
he didn't miss.

862
01:04:21,191 --> 01:04:22,525
Either way, it doesn't make sense.

863
01:04:22,734 --> 01:04:25,069
If he wanted to get away with it,
he likely would have

864
01:04:25,195 --> 01:04:26,862
and if he wanted to get caught,

865
01:04:27,197 --> 01:04:29,782
Barr was incapable of such perfection.

866
01:04:29,908 --> 01:04:31,742
Or maybe he just got lucky,
six shots out of six.

867
01:04:32,035 --> 01:04:34,078
That's what I was willing to accept,

868
01:04:34,204 --> 01:04:36,121
then those guys took a run at me.

869
01:04:36,581 --> 01:04:38,707
Whoever sent them made a mistake.

870
01:04:38,917 --> 01:04:41,252
It was just a bar fight.

871
01:04:41,545 --> 01:04:42,711
Maybe.

872
01:04:43,755 --> 01:04:46,590
Or maybe someone got nervous,
tried to run me off.

873
01:04:47,092 --> 01:04:51,387
Or put me in a coma,
right next to their patsy.

874
01:04:54,266 --> 01:04:55,766
Patsy?

875
01:04:57,102 --> 01:04:59,728
It was such a great crime scene.

876
01:04:59,813 --> 01:05:01,772
No one stopped to think
it might be too great.

877

878

Not your father.

879
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:07,945
Not even Barr's own defence attorney.

880
01:05:09,614 --> 01:05:11,282
But Barr knew I would,

881
01:05:12,951 --> 01:05:15,619
no matter how much
I wanted it to be true.

882
01:05:17,581 --> 01:05:19,331
That's why he asked for me.

883

Wait.

Are you suggesting...

885
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:25,921
James Barr is innocent.

You've got a case in your hands

Just, look. Listen.

with a cardboard sign three days ago.

895

Are you afraid you'll end up like Barr?

- Helen.
- Is that what this is?

Look out the window.

01:06:10,675 --> 01:06:11,967
No, I have work to do.

Well, imagine you've never seen it.

being told every day
you're defending freedom.

And finally
you decide you've had enough.

911

what you've given up your whole life for.

How many wish they were born
knowing what they know now?

921

You sure
that car was following you all day?

959
01:09:10,021 --> 01:09:11,855
As soon as you picked me up. Why?

960
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:21,949
It's registered to a company
called Lebendauer Enterprises.

961
01:09:32,544 --> 01:09:35,879
A conspiracy to kill five random people?

962
01:09:37,215 --> 01:09:38,715
That's ridiculous.

963
01:09:41,219 --> 01:09:42,553
Four.

964
01:09:44,055 --> 01:09:45,889
Four random people.

965
01:09:47,392 --> 01:09:49,518
To hide one specific target.

966
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:17,212
REACHER: Someone needed
Oline Archer's construction business.

967
01:10:19,883 --> 01:10:22,301
And Oline wouldn't let it go.

968
01:10:32,562 --> 01:10:34,813
It's a convincing theory.

969
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:39,484
But it's just a theory.

970
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:45,324
The first round is the least accurate.
The snipers call it a cold shot.

971
01:10:45,575 --> 01:10:47,659
Meanwhile, your eyewitness
described a pause

972
01:10:47,827 --> 01:10:50,078
between the first and second rounds.

973
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:53,081
The one shot where the killer
took his time.

974
01:10:53,333 --> 01:10:55,918
HELEN: And Oline Archer
was the second victim.

975
01:10:56,169 --> 01:10:58,837
The one shot that mattered.

976
01:11:00,673 --> 01:11:02,299
But it's just a theory.

977
01:11:03,676 --> 01:11:05,427
This frame was custom made for Barr.

978
01:11:06,346 --> 01:11:08,221
Whoever chose him
knew about Baghdad

979
01:11:08,306 --> 01:11:09,973
and the only one who could have
told him about Baghdad

980
01:11:10,058 --> 01:11:11,600
was Barr himself.

981
01:11:11,684 --> 01:11:15,187
He has at least one friend.
A very close one.

982
01:11:15,521 --> 01:11:17,856
Now, you find that friend,
you'll find the real shooter.

983
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:19,608
Find the real shooter? Reacher,

984
01:11:19,692 --> 01:11:22,527
my job is to present the jury
with reasonable doubt. Period.

985
01:11:22,612 --> 01:11:24,112
What about catching the guys
who really did this?

986
01:11:24,197 --> 01:11:26,281
- Catching the guys who did this?
- Bringing them to justice?

987
01:11:26,366 --> 01:11:28,450
- No, I can't take this to court.
- Exposing the truth.

988
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:32,204
Even if I believed Barr is innocent,
it's not my job.

989
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:36,708
I am just a lawyer. I'm not a cop.

I wouldn't do that. Not till I get back.

If I'm right,
someone killed four random people

1027
01:15:04,292 --> 01:15:06,459
so no one would look directly at Oline.

1028
01:15:06,836 --> 01:15:10,338
And if I'm right, just saying her name
could get you killed.

01:27:46,595 --> 01:27:48,596
Fine as frog's hair.

1118
01:27:48,931 --> 01:27:50,264
Rarer, too.

1119
01:27:50,766 --> 01:27:54,060
'Cause most of them fellas out there
can't shoot worth a damn.

1120
01:27:54,603 --> 01:27:58,272
You ask them to put
three rounds in the black, well,

1121
01:27:58,941 --> 01:28:00,608
they'll suck it.

1122
01:28:03,070 --> 01:28:06,405
- I'm looking for the owner.
- That'd be me. Martin Cash.

1123
01:28:06,615 --> 01:28:08,115
Aaron Ward.

1124
01:28:08,408 --> 01:28:10,368
What can I do you for,
Mr Ward? Ward?

1125
01:28:10,452 --> 01:28:13,996
Yeah. I'm looking for a friend of mine.
We served in Iraq.

1126
01:28:14,081 --> 01:28:15,706
The guy just dropped
off the grid, you know?

1127
01:28:16,083 --> 01:28:17,875
- It happens. Yep.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1128
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:19,251
Anyway, he was a shooter.

1129
01:28:19,378 --> 01:28:20,962
Last I heard, he lived
around here somewhere and I...

1130
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:23,089
When did he get out of the Army?

1131
01:28:24,633 --> 01:28:26,300
Well, I didn't say the Army.

1132
01:28:26,426 --> 01:28:29,428
Well, you said you served with him.
You're no jarhead.

1133
01:28:29,638 --> 01:28:32,139
Man on a flying horse could see that.

1134
01:28:32,265 --> 01:28:34,433
Well, my father was in the Corps,
if that helps.

1135
01:28:34,643 --> 01:28:37,478
Well, (CHUCKLES)
That makes you half human.

1136
01:28:39,106 --> 01:28:40,272
Your friend got a name?

1137
01:28:40,732 --> 01:28:42,566
Yeah. James Barr.

1138
01:28:43,819 --> 01:28:45,152
James Barr.

1139
01:28:45,821 --> 01:28:47,071
Never heard of him.

1140
01:28:48,448 --> 01:28:49,949
I think you have.

1141
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:52,994
I think you've been dreading the moment

1142
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:55,162
some cop comes in here
asking after him.

1143
01:28:55,497 --> 01:28:58,165
Because it's for sure
some soccer mom around here

1144
01:28:58,291 --> 01:29:02,628
is more worried about your range than
she is about the pool in her backyard

1145
01:29:02,838 --> 01:29:05,297
or the drain cleaner under her sink.

1146
01:29:06,842 --> 01:29:10,177
Wouldn't matter to her
if Barr did his killing 100 miles away,

1147
01:29:10,262 --> 01:29:12,138
only that he came here to rehearse.

1148
01:29:12,264 --> 01:29:13,806
She'd have a case to shut you down

1149
01:29:14,683 --> 01:29:16,851
and nothing better to do.

1150
01:29:17,811 --> 01:29:18,853
What do you want?

1151
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:22,314
I want to know who Barr's friends were.

1152
01:29:26,486 --> 01:29:27,611
Those boys out there,

1153
01:29:28,864 --> 01:29:31,657
they're mighty touchy when it comes
to their constitutional rights.

1154
01:29:32,367 --> 01:29:35,870
Suppose I tell them a cop is in here
asking after my members?

1155
01:29:36,038 --> 01:29:37,955
- I'm not a cop.
- What are you?

1156
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:39,123
I work for Barr's attorney.

1157
01:29:39,207 --> 01:29:41,042
We have reason to believe
he's innocent.

1158
01:29:41,168 --> 01:29:42,251
The hell you say.

1159
01:29:42,335 --> 01:29:47,048
Be that as it may, I'm the only one
who's bothered to track him this far.

1160
01:29:48,216 --> 01:29:51,844
You help me out, I'll be in your debt.

1161
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:53,304
And if I don't?

1162
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:57,308
Maybe you can coach soccer.

1163
01:30:02,064 --> 01:30:05,066
You put three in the centre
and maybe we'll talk.

1164
01:30:07,861 --> 01:30:09,153
Can I have a few to warm up?

1165
01:30:21,541 --> 01:30:23,501
(ALARM SOUNDING)

1166
01:31:33,238 --> 01:31:34,947
Six inches right.

1167
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:38,993
That's your mulligan, Mr Ward.
Play ball!

1168
01:31:39,953 --> 01:31:41,287
Let's go.

1169
01:32:26,541 --> 01:32:28,834
You're a little rusty, Mr Reacher.

1170
01:32:31,213 --> 01:32:33,839
I saw a man by that name
shoot for the Wimbledon Cup,

1171
01:32:33,965 --> 01:32:35,549
what, ten years ago.

1172
01:32:36,051 --> 01:32:39,011
And I'm pretty sure you never
played second base for the Yankees

1173
01:32:39,554 --> 01:32:41,222
in 1925.

1174
01:32:42,557 --> 01:32:43,724
Now,

1175
01:32:44,726 --> 01:32:46,227
I'll answer one question.

1176
01:32:47,354 --> 01:32:48,687
Who's your best shooter?

1177
01:32:50,190 --> 01:32:51,398
James Barr.

1178
01:32:54,903 --> 01:32:57,655
I pulled all these down
as soon as I heard about the shooting.

1179
01:33:02,744 --> 01:33:04,662
That's the best shot

1180
01:33:04,746 --> 01:33:06,914
I ever seen this side of civilian life.

1181
01:33:07,916 --> 01:33:12,336
Suppose I told you Barr wasn't this
good on his best day in the Army.

1182
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:15,506
I handed out those targets myself.
That's my scrawl on every one.

1183
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:17,591
Do you hang them downrange, too?

1184
01:33:17,926 --> 01:33:19,593
What, are you serious?

1185
01:33:20,262 --> 01:33:23,097
I'm saying
it's possible that Barr had a friend.

1186
01:33:23,556 --> 01:33:25,099
One who switched the targets
on the range.

1187
01:33:25,225 --> 01:33:26,558
Maybe Barr let him.

1188
01:33:26,768 --> 01:33:29,937
Made him feel like King Shit
having his name up on your wall.

1189
01:33:30,063 --> 01:33:34,441
I never saw one real shooter
who would do that for his own mother.

1190
01:33:35,944 --> 01:33:38,946
Unless he was framing his mother
for multiple murder

1191
01:33:40,282 --> 01:33:42,116
and using your range to do it.

1192
01:33:45,453 --> 01:33:47,579
Barr didn't come alone, did he?

1193
01:33:49,416 --> 01:33:52,751
You know, one of these nuts is likely
to kill you, they find that camera, there.

1194
01:33:52,961 --> 01:33:54,003
Hell, the camera's there

1195
01:33:54,087 --> 01:33:56,422
'cause one of these nuts
is likely to kill me.

1196
01:33:58,425 --> 01:33:59,591
There's Barr.

1197
01:34:00,635 --> 01:34:02,886
I always liked him. Always liked him.

1198
01:34:02,971 --> 01:34:04,054
There.

1199
01:34:05,098 --> 01:34:06,265
Him.

1200
01:34:09,644 --> 01:34:11,729
That son of a bitch.

1201
01:34:15,150 --> 01:34:16,275
(RINGING)

1202

1203

REACHER:
Got a candidate for our shooter.

1204
01:34:21,156 --> 01:34:23,490
Picture, possible prints

1205
01:34:23,992 --> 01:34:25,993
and one pissed-off eyewitness.

1206
01:34:26,328 --> 01:34:27,745
I can't talk right now.

1207
01:34:28,830 --> 01:34:30,331
Just give me three hours to get back.

1208
01:34:30,498 --> 01:34:32,499
And don't talk to anyone until I get there.

1209
01:34:32,625 --> 01:34:34,460
I'll look into that, thanks.

1210
01:34:35,837 --> 01:34:38,172
This is just
what I could pull this morning.

1211
01:34:38,465 --> 01:34:42,426
Tax records, city and state
permit applications, contract bids.

1212
01:34:42,510 --> 01:34:44,219
Shell corporation in Georgia.

1213
01:34:44,304 --> 01:34:46,680
That's the one next to Russia,
not Florida.

1214
01:34:47,474 --> 01:34:51,185
They work one city at a time,
acquiring a local construction concern

1215
01:34:51,478 --> 01:34:53,312
just ahead of major civic redevelopment.

1216
01:34:53,521 --> 01:34:57,191
They build bridges no one needs.
Highways no one uses.

1217
01:34:57,525 --> 01:35:02,029
They're like a cancer.
A cell that won't stop growing.

1218
01:35:03,698 --> 01:35:07,201
They moved 12 times in 15 years.
Atlanta, Albuquerque,

1219
01:35:07,327 --> 01:35:10,162
Austin, Oklahoma City, Sacramento.

1220
01:35:10,538 --> 01:35:13,374
Always amidst allegations of corruption

1221
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:16,960
including millions of dollars
in missing public funds.

1222
01:35:17,045 --> 01:35:21,382
And yet never an investigation.
Never even an inquiry.

1223
01:35:21,883 --> 01:35:25,552
It's as if Lebendauer Enterprises
were above reproach.

1224
01:35:29,516 --> 01:35:32,142
(SIGHS) Well, maybe that's because

1225
01:35:33,645 --> 01:35:36,021
the allegations come
from the competition.

1226
01:35:37,399 --> 01:35:39,024
Outbid. Bitter.

1227
01:35:39,567 --> 01:35:41,068
Like Oline Archer.

1228
01:35:41,569 --> 01:35:44,988
Or maybe Lebendauer
has the cooperation of key officials.

1229
01:35:45,073 --> 01:35:48,033
And maybe
when that cooperation isn't enough,

1230
01:35:48,410 --> 01:35:51,662
they kill people who won't be bought off.
Like Oline Archer.

1231
01:35:51,746 --> 01:35:53,914
Helen, how much of this
do you honestly believe?

1232
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:56,208
It doesn't matter how much I believe.

1233
01:35:56,918 --> 01:35:58,836
It doesn't even matter
how much I can prove.

1234
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:01,422
It only matters how much is true.

1235
01:36:01,714 --> 01:36:03,715
Do you know how delusional you sound?

1236
01:36:04,217 --> 01:36:05,884
What happened to you?

1237
01:36:06,261 --> 01:36:10,431
Are you really so set on putting
this man to death that you'd ignore...

1238
01:36:21,776 --> 01:36:24,945
I pulled all of this paper
under my own name.

1239

my life, your daughter's life,

1241
01:36:32,287 --> 01:36:34,121
is in danger now.

1242
01:36:35,790 --> 01:36:37,791
Whatever happens to me next
is on your head,

1243
01:36:38,251 --> 01:36:40,210
whether you're involved or not.

1244
01:36:42,964 --> 01:36:47,050
You are the District Attorney
and I've given you compelling evidence

1245
01:36:47,135 --> 01:36:49,052
to investigate Lebendauer Enterprises.

1246
01:36:49,471 --> 01:36:53,307
Your next move
will tell me which side you're on.

1247
01:36:53,933 --> 01:36:54,975
Oh.

1248
01:36:56,144 --> 01:36:57,603
I see. It's a test.

1249
01:36:58,771 --> 01:37:03,650
Well, this may be hard for you
to believe, but I do love you.

1250
01:37:05,653 --> 01:37:08,155
And obviously I'm not
going to turn a blind eye,

if you believe that,

then the next order of business,

1256
01:37:22,003 --> 01:37:25,172
is to put you
in protective custody right now.

1257
01:37:28,343 --> 01:37:30,260
And how safe will I be
if you're part of it?

01:59:42,759 --> 01:59:46,929
A retirement home.
If I go to prison at all.

1433
01:59:47,055 --> 01:59:48,222
You think you're gonna walk?

1434
01:59:48,431 --> 01:59:51,100
You are a homeless drifter
wanted for murder.

1435
01:59:51,434 --> 01:59:55,771
Meanwhile, I am an old man
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

1436
01:59:56,106 --> 02:00:00,192
Thanks to you,
who is left to say otherwise? Who?

1437
02:00:00,277 --> 02:00:04,113
HELEN: Yes, hello? Yes, there's...
I have an emergency.

1438
02:00:04,239 --> 02:00:06,282
We'll see which one of us
goes to prison.

1439
02:00:06,449 --> 02:00:08,951
There are maybe
three, four people dead.

1440
02:00:10,495 --> 02:00:11,954
- Okay.
- My bet?

1441
02:00:13,623 --> 02:00:14,999
Neither one.

1442
02:00:18,128 --> 02:00:19,670
What did you do?

1443
02:00:24,134 --> 02:00:25,676
What's it look like?

1444
02:00:27,429 --> 02:00:28,470
What about the truth?

1445
02:00:28,972 --> 02:00:31,390
What about getting the guys
who really did this?

1446
02:00:31,474 --> 02:00:33,475
What about bringing him to justice?

1447
02:00:34,644 --> 02:00:36,270
I just did.

1448
02:00:43,820 --> 02:00:46,947
HELEN: What about clearing Barr?
What about clearing you?

1449
02:00:47,157 --> 02:00:48,741
REACHER: I have faith you'll sort it out.

1450
02:00:48,825 --> 02:00:50,659
And I hear you have an in
with the local D.A.

1451
02:00:50,785 --> 02:00:52,995
HELEN: But what happens to you
in the meantime?

1452
02:00:53,163 --> 02:00:54,997
I keep moving. Same as always.

1453
02:00:55,123 --> 02:00:57,291
Wait, is that my car?

1454

(DOOR CLOSES)

1455
02:01:04,257 --> 02:01:05,299
This the lady?

1456
02:01:06,176 --> 02:01:08,344
Helen Rodin, Martin Cash.

1457
02:01:08,678 --> 02:01:09,803
A pleasure.

1458
02:01:11,181 --> 02:01:13,349
You look like hell there, Army.

1459
02:01:13,475 --> 02:01:17,144
You asked if I was afraid
I'd end up like Barr. I'm not.

1460
02:01:17,354 --> 02:01:19,188
I'm afraid I'll end up like this guy.

1461
02:01:19,314 --> 02:01:22,107
There's a lot of dead bodies out here.
So let's get to it.

1462
02:01:22,192 --> 02:01:25,027
- We should probably go.
- Wait. That's it?

1463
02:01:25,528 --> 02:01:26,695
It's just over?

1464
02:01:27,822 --> 02:01:29,531
You'll be all right, counsellor.

1465
02:01:29,699 --> 02:01:32,368
No. What if I need you?
How will I find you?

1466
02:01:32,661 --> 02:01:33,869
You don't need me.

1467
02:01:35,497 --> 02:01:36,789
Not any more.

I'm Helen Rodin, your attorney.

This conversation is protected
by attorney-client privilege.

02:02:05,193 --> 02:02:06,235
Yeah.

1474
02:02:06,319 --> 02:02:08,570
Now, the police didn't
talk to you, did they?

1475
02:02:08,738 --> 02:02:10,572
They're not allowed
to do that without me here.

1476
02:02:14,577 --> 02:02:16,245
How bad was it?

1477
02:02:18,248 --> 02:02:19,581
How many did I...

1478
02:02:20,750 --> 02:02:22,751
You don't remember
anything about the incident?

1479
02:02:26,381 --> 02:02:27,423
No.

1480
02:02:28,925 --> 02:02:32,094
But I could hear the nurses
talking to those cops out there.

(SOBBING) I don't even
remember wanting to do it!

Look, I'm not gonna fight this.

1483
02:02:46,776 --> 02:02:49,111
If they say I done it, then I did.

1484
02:02:49,779 --> 02:02:51,447
I done things before.

1485
02:02:54,117 --> 02:02:55,451
I did something bad.

1486
02:02:58,121 --> 02:02:59,288
Real bad.

1487
02:03:03,126 --> 02:03:04,793
A long time ago.

1488
02:03:08,298 --> 02:03:09,965
And I got away with it.

1490
02:03:19,142 --> 02:03:20,976
how well do you know this place?

1491
02:03:32,280 --> 02:03:33,655
Pretty well.

1492
02:03:34,324 --> 02:03:35,824
And how do you think
you would have done it?

1493
02:03:39,496 --> 02:03:40,829
I guess

1494
02:03:46,836 --> 02:03:48,837
I would have parked up on the highway.

1495
02:03:49,297 --> 02:03:51,840
The sun would be at my back
that time of day.

1496
02:03:53,510 --> 02:03:54,635
I got a van.

1497
02:03:55,970 --> 02:03:57,638
Set up in back.

1498
02:03:58,348 --> 02:04:00,682
Wouldn't have to worry about my brass.

1499
02:04:02,519 --> 02:04:04,520
Get away real clean, too.

Sounds as if you know your stuff.

At least he used to be.

1516

He doesn't care about the law.
