1
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,400
This is unbelievable!
Look at this!

2
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,300
There's no city like this in the world.
There never was!

3
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,500
You act like you've never been here before.

4
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,300
I don't get here often enough.
That's the problem.

5
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,400
Can you picture how drop-dead
gorgeous this city is in the rain?

6
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,600
Imagine this town in the '20s.
Paris in the '20s,

7
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,800
in the rain; the artists and writers.

8
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,900
Why does every city have to be in the rain?

9
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,200
What's wonderful about getting wet?

10
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,800
I mean, could you ever picture us
moving here after we're married?

11
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,200
Oh God, no.

12
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,500
I could never live out of the United States.

13
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,100
You know, if I'd stayed here and written novels,

14
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,500
and not gotten, you know, caught up in that,
just, grinding out movie scripts...

15
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,100
I'll tell you something:

16
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,400
I would drop the house in Beverly Hills,

17
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,300
the pool, everything,
in a second.

18
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,700
I mean, look:
This is where Monet lived and painted.

19
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,600
We're 30 minutes from town.

20
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,500
Imagine the two of us settling here.

21
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,900
We could do it, I mean,
if my book turns out.

22
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,300
You're in love with a fantasy.

23
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm in love with you.

24
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,600
We should get back to town.
We're meeting Mom and Dad for dinner.

25
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,800
Let's meet 'em.

26
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,500
<i>There are our sightseers.</i>

27
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,000
If I never see another charming
boulevard or bistro again, I...

28
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,200
- What a town!
- Yes. To visit.

29
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,700
I could see myself living here!

30
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,700
I feel like the Parisians kind of "get me."

31
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,800
I can see myself just strolling
along the Left Bank with a,

32
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,600
you know, baguette under my arm,

33
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,200
headed to CafÃ© de Flore
to scribble away on my book.

34
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,900
What did Hemingway say?
He called it a "moveable feast."

35
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,500
In this traffic, nothing moves.

36
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,900
Well, a toast to John's new business venture here!

37
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,500
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

38
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,700
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

39
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,000
Well, I'll be perfectly frank.

40
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:27,700
I'm excited about this corporate merger between
our folks and the French company, but otherwise,

41
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm not a big Francophile.

42
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,100
- John hates their politics.
- Certainly been no friend to the United States.

43
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,800
Well, I mean, you can't exactly blame them

44
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,600
for not following us down that rabbit's hole in Iraq.

45
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,700
- The whole Bush, you know,...
- Oh, please. Let's not get into this

46
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,600
- bad discussion again and again.
- Honey, honey. We're not getting into-- By the way, it's

47
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,600
fine for your father and I to disagree.

48
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,700
That's what a democracy is.

49
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,400
Your father defends the right-wing of the Republican party,

50
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,500
and I happen to think you almost got to be

51
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,700
- like, a demented lunatic, but it's like...
- Okay. Okay!

52
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,300
But it doesn't mean we don't
respect each other's views, am I right?

53
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,600
- Can we talk about the wedding plans?
- Yes! Please.

54
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,500
Let's do that.

55
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,100
- Your father is just...
- Inez?

56
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,600
- Huh? Carol?
- Hi.

57
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,900
Oh my G... What are you doing here?

58
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,900
- Nice to see you! Hi.
- Hey!

59
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,800
- How are you?
- Good, thanks.

60
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,100
Paul and Carol Bates, this is my mother

61
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,500
- and father, and, of course, you know Gail.
- Hi. Very nice to meet you.

62
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,000
Well, you... you didn't mention
you were going to be here.

63
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,100
No, it was sudden. Um...

64
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,100
<i>Paul got invited to lecture at
the Sorbone.(sic.) Sorbonne.</i>

65
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,600
Oh, how wonderful!

66
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,700
Well, uh, Dad's here on business,
and we just decided to

67
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,300
- freeload along. - Yes.
- Oh.

68
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,300
That's great. We can spend some time together.

69
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,900
Well, I think we have a
lot of commitments, but I'm sure it's...

70
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,800
- What?
- Well, what are doing tomorrow?

71
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,600
- We're driving to Verrsailles. (sic.)
- Versailles...

72
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,500
- Versailles.
- Oh,

73
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,500
- I'm dying to see Versailles.
- Yeah!

74
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,100
But it's too...uh...
We're late...I think what we're...

75
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,200
Tomorrow we're locked in
to a lunch at Brasserie Lipp.

76
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:02,000
- Oh no, that's just...
- Yeah. Yeah, we are. That's already...

77
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,500
You know I actually had
a professor that dined there,

78
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,400
and saw James Joyce!

79
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,400
Yeah, you know, like a
million years ago, and

80
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:14,000
apparently, Joyce was eating
sauerkraut and frankfurters.

81
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,000
Is that...
That's the end of the story?

82
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Well, I mean it's not a story.
It's like a detailed...

83
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:23,000
- We would LOVE to go to Versailles. Yes.
- Oh, good.

84
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,600
I hope you're not going to be
as antisocial tomorrow at Versailles.

85
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,900
- How was I antisocial?
- Oh, please!

86
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,200
I mean, you could totally tell you didn't want to go.

87
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,900
Well, I mean, they're your
friends, and I have to admit

88
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,700
I'm not quite as taken with them as you are.

89
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,900
He's brilliant.

90
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,500
You know, I had such a crush on him
in college, and Carol's very bright.

91
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,500
Well, he's a pseudo-intellectual.

92
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,200
- Just a little bit.
- Uh, Gil,

93
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:51,200
I hardly think he'd be lecturing at
the Sorbonne if he's a pseudo-intellectual.

94
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,500
You should give him your book to read.

95
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,000
Oh, come on. Why?

96
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,000
No, because he could critique your writing,

97
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,300
and maybe show you why you're
having so much trouble.

98
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm having trouble because
I'm a Hollywood hack

99
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,000
who never gave actual
literature a real shot.

100
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,200
- Until now.
- Please...Gil...

101
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,400
Honey, just promise me something.

102
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,000
If this book...doesn't pan out,

103
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,200
that you'll stop
eating your brains out,

104
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:18,100
and just go back to doing
what you do best.

105
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:22,800
I mean, the studios adore you.
You're in demand...

106
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:26,100
Do you really want to give
it all up just to struggle?

107
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
- Well...
- Mmm?

108
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,700
Mmm?

109
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,400
Why would you...want to do that?

110
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,500
I believe Louis moved his court here,

111
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,800
uh, in 1682.

112
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,800
Originally, all this was swampland.

113
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,600
In fact, if I'm not mistaken,

114
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,900
uh... in Old French, the word "versailles"

115
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,000
means, uh, something like,

116
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,300
- "terrain were the weeds have been pulled."
- Is that right?

117
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,800
Uh... The... uh, middle section here

118
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,600
uh... is... uh, French classical style at its height.

119
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,600
Uh... The work, I believe, of...
uh, "Louis Vau" (Louis le Vau)

120
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,300
- Yes.
- Uh...Mansart...I think...

121
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,500
- Manzard. (sic.)
- ...and Charles le Brun, I believe.

122
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,400
Yes, that's right.

123
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,500
I could get used to a summer home like this.

124
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,400
- I know you could.
- Me, too,

125
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,400
except, remember: in those days,

126
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,500
they only had baths,
and I'm definitely a shower man.

127
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,200
Where are you two planning on
moving after you get married?

128
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,400
Uh...Malibu.

129
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,000
- Really?
- We're thinking about Malibu, yeah.

130
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,200
I'm pushing for a little
attic in Paris with a skylight.

131
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,600
- La bowhem? (sic.)
- Yeah,

132
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,300
all that's missing is the tuberculosis.

133
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,700
Exactly. Thank you.

134
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,600
I mean, you know, the problem
is that he's not exactly sure

135
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,400
- he can write a novel.
- Really?

136
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,100
- Well...
- I mean, honey, so far your track record's-- you know, and...

137
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,300
well, everyone loves your movies.

138
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,800
- Yeah, well scripts are easier, so...
- Wow.

139
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,400
Why don't you tell them about the lead
character that you're working on right now?

140
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,100
- Yes!  - Oh, come on.
- I don't like to discuss my work.

141
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,700
Well, dear, you don't have to tell
them the whole plot, just the character.

142
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,600
- No, no, no.
- Okay.

143
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,300
He works in a nostalgia shop.

144
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,500
- What's a-- What's a nostalgia shop?
- Oh, not one of those stores where they sell

145
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,100
Shirley Temple dolls and old radios?

146
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,900
- And I never know who buys that stuff. Who'd want it?
- Exactly.

147
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,200
- I don't know.
- Well, people who live in the past,

148
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,900
people who think that
their lives would be happier

149
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,100
if they lived in an earlier time.

150
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,700
And just which era

151
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:14,000
would you have preferred
to live in, Miniver Cheevy?

152
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,900
Paris in the '20s, in the rain.

153
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,700
- Wouldn't have been bad.
- And the rain was an acid rain.

154
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,600
Oh, I see! And no global warming,

155
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,600
no TV and suicide bombing,

156
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,700
and nuclear weapons, drug cartels!

157
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,300
Usual menu of clichÃ©d horror stories.

158
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,300
You know, nostalgia is denial.

159
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,600
- Denial of the painful present.
- Oh, whoa!

160
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,200
Gil is a complete romantic.
I mean, he would be

161
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,200
more than happy living in a
complete state of perpetual denial.

162
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,300
- Really?
- And the name for this fallacy

163
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,600
is called "golden-age thinking."

164
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,200
- TouchÃ©.
- Yeah, the erroneous notion that

165
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,500
a different time period is better
than the one one's living in.

166
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:53,200
It's a flaw in the Romantic
imagination of those people who...

167
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:57,300
who find it difficult to
cope with the depressive.

168
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,400
<i>- Yes.
- This is the nicest ring we saw.</i>

169
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,800
Diamonds for a wedding band.

170
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,300
That's the way you'd have to go.
And then, everyone will see

171
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,700
it in the back row when
he puts it on my finger.

172
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,600
Oh, Inez. It's gonna be such an event!

173
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,600
- I only wish that...
- I don't want to keep going over it.

174
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,600
It's your choice. What can I say?

175
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:23,200
Gil is-- he's smart,
and he's very successful.

176
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,800
- He talks about giving that all up and moving here!
- Oh, yeah, he TALKS about it.

177
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,200
Well, that frightens me.

178
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,700
This is, of course, Rodin's most famous statue.

179
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,000
A cast of this work was placed next to his tomb.

180
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,300
Rodin wished it to serve as his headstone and epitaph.

181
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,600
- Is that true?
- It would be in Moudon. He died of the flu,

182
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,800
if I'm not mistaken. In 1917, I believe.

183
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,400
- Very good, sir.
- He's so knowledgeable, isn't he?

184
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:54,600
Yeah. So much of Rodin's work was influenced by his wife, Camille.

185
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,300
Yes, she was an influence, though
Camille was not the wife, but his mistress.

186
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,400
- Camille? No.
- Yes.

187
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,300
- Yes. Rose was the wife.
- No, he was never married to Rose.

188
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,100
Yes, he did marry Rose,

189
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,500
- in the last year their lives.
- I think you're mistaken.

190
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,700
Are you arguing with the guide?

191
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,800
- Yes, I am.
- Yeah. No, I'm certain, monsieur.

192
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,900
Yeah, actually, she's right.

193
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,400
I recently read a two-volume
biography on Rodin, and

194
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,200
Rose was definitely the wife.
Camille, the mistress.

195
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,800
- Yeah. You read that? Where did you...
- Yeah, I just read it.  I was surprised

196
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,600
because I mistakenly thought, like you, that it was, yeah,

197
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,000
the other way around.
It's an easy mistake.

198
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,200
So, Dad invited you guys for a wine-tasting.

199
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
- Oh, it'll be so French!
- Yeah, yeah.

200
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,600
Paul is an expert on French wine.

201
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:41,200
- You're joking. Really?
- Yes, of course.

202
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,400
When did you read the biography on Rodin?

203
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,600
Me? Why would I read
a biography on Rodin?

204
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,800
I will always take a California wine, but,

205
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,200
Napa Valley's 6,000 miles away.

206
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,300
John, old boy, how are you, buddy?

207
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,700
Oh, hey! What're you doing here?

208
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,200
Come on. I can't stand that guy.

209
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,300
Um...How 'bout

210
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,000
- we try some more wine?
- Yes! Let's start here.

211
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,500
Now, which would you prefer here?

212
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,200
Well, I think we need to be scientific and just

213
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,200
start drinking them all again. I don't know.

214
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,700
- Why are your cheeks so red?
- What do you mean?

215
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,300
- They're not red.
- They're bright red.

216
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,500
Oh, maybe it's because of the
pheromones that you're giving off.

217
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,400
These pheromones are driving me mad!

218
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:26,400
- Stop it! Stop!
- Ahh-- Sex and alcohol.

219
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,900
- Yeah.
- It fuels the desire

220
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,800
but kills the performance,
according to the Bard.

221
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,400
Have you tasted the '61?

222
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,800
It is divine!

223
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,500
- Though, Paul picked it out. I didn't...
- What?

224
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:42,000
- What's happening? What's happening?
- Slightly more tannic than the '59,

225
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,200
and I prefer a smoky feeling
to a fruity feeling.

226
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,800
So, Carol-- Carol and I
are gonna go dancing.

227
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,000
We heard of a great place. Interested?

228
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,400
- No... I don't want to be a killjoy,
- Come on!

229
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,400
but I need to get a little fresh air.

230
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,900
Oh, come on! Come on!

231
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,300
Although if you're just gonna sit there and obsess

232
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,200
over where the fire exits are, then...

233
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,200
Hey! If Gil doesn't want to go,
I'll share Paul with you.

234
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,200
I am very democratic,

235
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,100
and Paul is a marvelous dancer.

236
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,100
If it's OK with you,
I think I just want to take a little walk,

237
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,700
go to bed, and then we'll do it another night.

238
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,500
OK. Alright, well I can go, though, right?

239
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,800
- You want to go?
- Well, yeah,

240
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,400
Yeah, I mean, I'm not tired,
and I've been dying to go dancing,

241
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,300
and I'll just meet you back at the hotel.

242
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,600
- I'll take good care of her.
- OK.

243
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,200
I'll get a cab. Taxi!

244
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,300
- OK, but you should take a cab.
- No, I'm not taking a cab.  I'm walking.

245
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,200
- No, you'll get lost.
- OK, I'm gonna walk.

246
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,500
Is he a good writer?
I mean, have you read his prose?

247
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,300
- Well, he won't let anybody.
- He won't let?

248
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,900
Oh look, I mean, if he wants, I'd be glad to
look over his novel and critique it for him.

249
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,000
- That would be great!
- Would you?

250
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,200
- You know, I think that's what he needs!
- Yeah?

251
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,700
- Well, it helps.
- To have it read by someone. Yeah!

252
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,200
- And you wouldn't pull any punches?

253
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,900
- Well, I certainly won't be letting
you know I won't do that.
-No.

254
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,100
I do that about you.

255
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,800
See, but, the problem is,
when it comes to his writing,

256
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,300
he has absolutely no respect
for anybody else's opinion.

257
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,600

298
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,900
- Oh, right now I'm working on a novel.
- Oh, yes?

299
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,900
I'm Zelda, by the way.
Oh, Scott! Scott!

300
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:36,300
- Yes, what it is, sweetheart?
- Here's a writer, from, um... where?

301
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:41,200
- California.
- Scott Fitzgerald, and who are you, old sport?

302
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:47,300
Gil...the...
You have the same names as...

303
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,800
As what?

304
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,000
Scott Fitzgerald and...

305
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:55,300
Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald. The Fitzgeralds.
Isn't she beautiful?

306
00:19:55,100 --> 00:20:02,200
Yes. Yes! Yeah, that's...
that's a coincidence...like....uh...

307
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:09,200
You have a glazed look in your eye.
Stunned. Stupefied. Anesthetized. Lobotomized.

308
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:14,300
I...I...keep looking at the man playing piano, and I

309
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:18,500
believe it or not, recognize his
face from some old sheet music.

310
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:25,400
I know I can be one of the great writers
of musical lyrics - not that I can write melodies, and I try,

311
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,100
and then I hear the songs he writes,
and then I realize:  I'll never write a great lyric,

312
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:32,600
- and my talent really lies in drinking.
- Sure does.

313
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:37,300
Yeah, but, he didn't write the music, did he?

314
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:40,300
That's not possible...

315
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,900
So...um...

316
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:48,800
- What kind of books do you write?
- I...I...I'm working on a...um...

317
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,500
Where am I?

318
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,400
Oh, I'm sorry.  Don't you know the host?

319
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:57,400
Some friends have gotten together
a little party for Jean Cocteau.

320
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,100
Hey, lady. What...
Are you kiddding me?

321
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:08,900
I know what you're thinking.
This is boring. I agree!

322
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,700
I'm ready to move on. Let's do Bricktop's!

323
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,600
- Bricktop's?
- I'm bored! He's bored! We're all bored.

324
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,600
We. Are. All. Bored.
Let's do Bricktop's.

325
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,100
Why don't you tell Cole and Linda
to come with, and...um...

326
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,200
uh...Gil? You coming?

I've been mixing grain and grape.

Now, this a writer. uh...Gil. Yes?

- Gil...Gil Pender.
- Gil Pender.

340
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,600
Hemingway.

341
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,100
Hemingway?

342
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,900
You liked my book?

343
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:17,800
Liked? I loved!
All your work.

344
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,500
Yes, it was a good book,
because it was an honest book,

345
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,800
and that's what war does to men.

346
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,900
And there's nothing fine and noble
about dying in the mud,

347
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,000
unless you die gracefully,

348
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:32,000
and then it's not only noble, but brave.

349
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,500
Did you read my story?
What'd you think?

350
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,200
There was some fine writing in it,
but it was unfulfilled.

351
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,300
- I might've known you'd hate it.
- But darling, you're too sensitive.

352
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,200
You liked my story, but he hates me!

353
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:47,000
Please, old sport,
you make matters extremely difficult.

354
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:50,900
I'm jumpy.  Suddenly I don't like
the atmosphere here any more.

355
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,500
Ah! Where're you going?

(To meet some friends on Saint-Germain.)</i>

357
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,500
- He's going to Saint-Germain. I'm going with him.
- Zelda, sweetheart...

358
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:01,500
If you're going to stay here and drink
with him, I'm going with the toreador.

359
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,600
Would you bring her back
at a reasonable time?

360
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,300
- She'll drive you crazy, this woman.
- She's exciting,

361
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,000
and she has talent.

362
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,700
This month it's writing.
Last month it was something else.

363
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:16,300
You're a writer. You need time to write.
Not all this fooling around.

364
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,100
She's wasting you because she's
really a competitor. Don't you agree?

365
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,600
Me?

366
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,000
Speak up, for Christ's sake! I'm asking if
you think my friend is making a tragic mistake.

367
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,700
Actually, I don't know the Fitzgeralds that well.

368
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,400
You're a writer. You make observations.
You were with them all night!

369
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,200
Could we not discuss my personal life in public?

370
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:36,000
She's jealous of his gift,
and it's a fine gift. It's rare.

371
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:39,000
- You like his work? You can speak for it.
- Stop it! Stop it.

372
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,200
You like Mark Twain?

373
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,200
I'm going to find Zelda.

374
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:45,100
I don't like the thought
of her with that Spaniard.

375
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,100
May I?

376
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,500
Yeah, I'm actually a huge Mark Twain fan.

377
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:54,200
I think you can even make the case
that all modern American literature

378
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,600
comes from Huckleberry Finn.

379
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:01,800
- You box?
- No. Not really. No.

380
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,200
What're you writing?

381
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,500
- A novel.
- 'Bout what?

382
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,900
It's about a man who works
in a nostalgia shop.

383
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,700
What the hell is a nostalgia shop?

384
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,700
A place where they sell old things. Memorabilia.

385
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,800
and... Does that sound terrible?

386
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,400
No subject is terrible if the story is true.

387
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:27,800
If the prose is clean and honest,
and if it affirms grace and courage under pressure.

388
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,100
No good.

389
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:34,200
Can I ask you the biggest favor in the world?

390
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,200
- What is it?
- Would you read it?

391
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,200
- Your novel?
- Yeah, it's like

392
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:43,800
400 pages long, and I'm just
looking for, you know, an opinion.

393
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,800
My opinion is I hate it.

394
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,900
I mean, you haven't even read it.

395
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,100
If it's bad, I'll hate it
because I hate bad writing,

396
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,400
and if it's good, I'll be envious and hate it all the more.
You don't want the opinion of another writer.

397
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,500
Yeah. You know, it's just...
You know what it is?

398
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,600
I'm having a hard time,

399
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,400
you know, trusting somebody to evaluate it.

400
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:05,200
Writers are competitive.

401
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,700
I'm not gonna be competitive with you.

402
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,000
You're too self-effacing.
It's not manly.

403
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,600
If you're a writer,
declare yourself the best writer!

404
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:17,000
But you're not, as long as I'm around.
Unless you want to put the gloves on and settle it?

405
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,500
No, I don't.

406
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,600
Hey, I'm not gonna read your novel,
but I'll tell you what I'll do.

407
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,700
Yes?

408
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,900
I'll bring it to Gertrude Stein's.

409
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:26,300
She's the only one I trust with my writing.

410
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,300
You'll show my novel to Gertrude Stein?

411
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,100
- Give it to me.
- I'll bring it to you.

412
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,700
- And she gets back from Spain tomorrow.
- Great.

413
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,800
I'm gonna go get it.
I'm gonna...

414
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:39,100
I can't tell you how excited I am!
This is gonna be such a lift!

415
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,000
My heart is just racing right now!

416
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,900
I'm gonna get it, and I'll be back.

417
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:58,000
Whoa, whoa, Gil!
Take it easy!

418
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:02,300
You had a big night.
Fitzgerald. Hemingway!

419
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,600
Papa!
You gotta...

420
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,300
OK, we never said where
we were gonna meet.

421
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:49,600
Good thing you didn't go last night.
You would've hated the music, and the crowd,

422
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,400
but I had fun.

423
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,400
What're you thinking about?
You seem like you're in a daze.

424
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,700
If I was to tell you that I spent

425
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,200
last night with Ernest Hemingway
and Scott Fitzgerald,

426
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,500
- what would you say?
- Is that what you were dreaming about?

427
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,400
Your literary idols?

428
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,700
Yeah, but if I wasn't dreaming...

429
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,500
What does that mean?

430
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,700
If I was with Hemingway,
and Fitzgerald,

431
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,100
and Cole Porter.

432
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,000
I'd be thinking brain tumor.

433
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,300
And when I tell you,
Zelda Fitzgerald is exactly

434
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:26,800
as we've come to know her through
everything we've read in books and articles.

435
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,700
You know, charming, but all over the map.

436
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,500
You know, she does not like
Hemingway one bit.

437
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:37,800
and Scott knows Hemingway is right about her,
but you can see how conflicted he is because he loves her!

438
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,700
Come on! Get up! We should

439
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,600
quit the idle chatter,
because we're gonna be late.

440
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,700
You know, I'm not gonna...

441
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,400
I think I'm gonna stay here
and do some work on my novel,

442
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,300
'cause there's a little polishing I wanna do.

443
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,800
No. You can do that later.
Mom said we can use her decorator's discount. Get up!

444
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,200
Come look at these, Inez.

445
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:01,500
Wouldn't these be charming in a Malibu beach house?

446
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,600
<i>- Combien, monsieur? (How much, sir?)
- Dix-huit mille. (â¬18,000)</i>

447
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,300
<i>- Merci. (Thanks.)
- What is that?</i>

448
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,700
There a steal at $18,000.

449
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,100
$18,000 for this?

450
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Oh wait. It's Euros, so it's more.

451
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,900
- So that's like 20. $20,000.
- Even more, I think. Yeah.

452
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:20,100
I know, but it's very hard
to find anything like this at home.

453
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,100
- She's right, Gil.
- I know, but we haven't even found a house yet,

454
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:28,800
and we're trying to keep expenses down,
so I don't have to take any crummy rewrite jobs.

455
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,900
Well, you get what you pay for.

456
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,300
- Nice.
- Cheap is cheap.

457
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,800
OK, you guys want to walk back?

458
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:39,300
Walk? No, it's starting to rain.

459
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:42,200
Oh, it'll be nice walking in the rain!
It's beautiful!

460
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,400
No, there's nothing beautiful
about walking in the rain.

461
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,900
No, don't forget.
We're taking you to dinner tonight.

462
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,300
Oh, right. Yes. Great.

463
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,300
And then, also, I have a big
surprise for you after dinner.

464
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:57,700
- What? No. I don't like surprises.
- I have an incredible...Trust me, you're gonna love this.

465
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,400
- What is it?
- Are you sure you don't want to walk in the rain?

466
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:03,700
This is our last chance.
It's not that bad out.

467
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,500
Okay.

468
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,000
I don't understand.
Where are we going?

469
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,900
But, you made us rush through dinner,

470
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,300
and Dad wasn't finished with his profiteroles.

471
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,800
Profiteroles? You're going to have
the most amazing adventure of your life!

472
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,300
- Where?
- Just, Inez, please.

473
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:27,800
- Why are you carrying that manuscript around?
- You'll see, and when you do,

474
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,600
your jaw is gonna drop.

475
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:34,900
OK. You know I wouldn't hide anything,
so if I'm saying it's incredible,

476
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:38,500
- it's...
- OK.

477
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:46,300
- It's just, I don't understand!
- I know. You've been wondering why I've been acting strange all day?

478
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,400
- Yeah.
- Well, you're about to find out,

479
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:53,200
and you're gonna wonder why I wasn't
acting more strange, when you find out.

480
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,500
- This is very...
- I know. I know.

481
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:08,500
Well, I don't know what you're carrying on about,
but this is not my idea of an amazing adventure.

482
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,800
I am tired from the gym and a massage,
so I'm gonna get this cab.

483
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,200
- Taxi!
- Inez, wait!

484
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,200
- Let's just wait a little longer.
- Look,

485
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,600
you want to walk the streets of Paris,
and take it in by night,

486
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:23,300
that's fine. You go ahead.
But I'm in the middle of a great book that Carol lent me.

487
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:26,000
Come on, just 10 more minutes,
and then we can walk home.

488
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:29,200
If I'm asleep when you get in,
don't wake me up.

489
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,000
What am I doing wrong?

490
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:40,300
Unless she's right,
and I need to see a neurologist.

491
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:45,600
OK, you left the wine-tasting, a little drunk,
but not out of control.

492
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:49,200
Lost, you walk along...
this is the spot...

493
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,600
I mean, it's just like a one-shot deal.

494
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:56,100
The clock struck midnight...

495
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,800
Hello!

496
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,400
Oh, hi, Mr. Hemingway. Here.

497
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,200
Let me just jump in.

498
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,700
The assignment was to take the hill.
There were 4 of us.

499
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,100
5 if you counted Vicente, but he had
lost his hand when a grenade went off

500
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,400
and couldn't fight as he could when I first met him.

501
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,300
And he was young, and brave.

502
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,300
And the hill was soggy from days of rain,
and the hill sloped down toward a road,

503
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,700
and there were many German soldiers on the road.

504
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,700
And the idea was to aim for the first group,

505
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,800
and if our aim was true, we could delay them.

506
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,500
- Were you scared?
- Of what?

507
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,200
Getting killed?

508
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:57,600
You'll never write well
if you're afraid of dying.

509
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,200
- Do you?
- Yeah, I do. I'd say it's probably...

510
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,300
maybe my greatest fear, actually.

511
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,800
Well, that's something all men before
you have done. All men will do.

512
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,600
- I know. I know.
- Have you ever made love to a truly great woman?

513
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:12,900
Actually, my fiancÃ©e is pretty sexy.

514
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,700
And when you make love to her,
you feel true, and beautiful

515
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,800
passion, and you, for at least that moment,
lose your fear of death.

516
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,900
No. That doesn't happen.

517
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,800
I believe that love that is true and real
creates a respite from death.

518
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:30,200
All cowardice comes from not loving,
or not loving well, which is the same thing.

519
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
And when the man who is brave and true
looks Death squarely in the face

520
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:38,200
like some rhino-hunters I know,
or Belmonte, who's truly brave.

521
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:43,200
It is because they love with sufficient
passion, to push death out of their minds,

522
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,800
until it returns, as it does, to all men.

523
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,900
And then you must make really good love again.

524
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,000
Think about it.

525
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,600
- Alice. How the hell are you?
- Hi!

526
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,800
Good? Good. Ah, she's here. Follow me.

527
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,300
<i>- Non. Je ne suis pas d'accord.(No. I don't agree.)
- Mais pourquoi? (But why?)</i>

528
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,500
<i>Parce-que... (Because...)</i>

529
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,900
This is Gil Pender, Miss Stein.

530
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,400
He's a young American writer.
I thought you two should know each other.

531
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,800
I'm glad you're here.

532
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:23,700
You can help decide which of us is right,
and which of us is wrong.

533
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:27,000
I was just telling Pablo that
this portrait doesn't capture Adriana.

534
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:30,200
It has a universality, but no objectivity.

535
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,200
<i>Non, non, non. Vous ne le comprenez pas correctement.
(No, no ,no. You don't understand correctly.)</i>

536
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,900
<i>Connaisez pas Adriana. Regardez...
(You don't know Adriana. Look...)</i>

537
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,400
<i>Regardez le mouvement, le tableau.
(Look at the motion, the painting.)</i>

538
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,000
<i>C'est exactement ce qu'elle reprÃ©sente!
(It's exactly what she represents!)</i>

539
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
<i>Non. Tu n'as pas raison.(No. You're wrong.)
Look how he's done her:</i>

540
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:42,300
dripping with sexual innuendo,

541
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:46,200
carnal to the point of smoldering,
and, yes, she's beautiful, but

542
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:49,100
it's a subtle beauty;
an implied sensuality.

543
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,600
I mean, what is your first
impression of Adriana?

544
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,000
Exceptionally lovely.

545
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:00,200
<i>Belle, mais trop subtile. Plus implicite, Pablo!
(Beautiful, but too subtle. More defined, Pablo!)</i>

546
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,500
Yes, you're right, Miss Stein.
'Course...uh...

547
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,700
you can see why he's lost all objectivity.

548
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,600
He's made a creature of Place Pigalle.

549
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,300
A whore with volcanic appetites.

550
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,700
<i>Non, non! C'est ce qu'elle vraiment si vous la connaissez!
(No, no! It's true if you know her!)</i>

551
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,800
<i>Yes, avec toi, au privÃ©,
(Yes, with you, in private,)</i>

552
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,600
because she's your lover,
but we don't know her that way!

553
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:19,400
So you make a petit-bourgeois judgment
and turn her into an object of pleasure.

554
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,200
<i>- It's more like a still-life than a portrait.
- Non.</i>

555
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:26,800
<i>Non. Non. Je ne suis pas d'accord.
(No. No. I do not agree.)</i>

556
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,800
And what's this book of
yours I've been hearing about?

557
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,700
Is this it?

558
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,600
- Yeah, this is...uh...
- I'll take a look.

559
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,300
Have you read it, Hemingway?

560
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,900
No, this I leave to you.
You've always been a fine judge of my work.

561
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,600
" "Out of the Past" was the name of the store,"

562
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,900
"and its products consisted of memories."

563
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,100
"What was prosaic and
even vulgar to one generation,"

564
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:48,000
"had been transmuted by
the mere passing of years"

565
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:52,200
"to a status at once magical and also camp."

566
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,100
I love it.

567
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,600
I'm already hooked.
Hooked!

568
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,000
I'll start it tonight,

569
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:02,800
but first, you and I
have something to talk about.

570
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:06,300
<i>I've been waiting for two months
for a reply from that editor.</i>

571
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:09,200
<i>I sent him the piece you and I
looked at, plus four others,</i>

572
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:12,800
<i>plus four shorter pieces.
And this guy, I gave him a copy of the...</i>

573
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:19,600
<i>- Nevertheless, two months: nary a word.
- Right.</i>

574
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:25,300
So were you really hooked
with those opening lines?

575
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:31,200
Oh, the past has always had a
great charisma for me.

576
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,300
Oh, me, too.
Great charisma for me.

577
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:38,000
I always say that I was born too late.

578
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:40,600
<i>Mmm. Moi aussi.
(Mmm. Me, too.)</i>

579
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,900
<i>For me, la Belle Ãpoque Paris
would have been perfect.</i>

580
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,800
- Really? Better than now?
- Yes.

581
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:51,300
Another whole sensibility,
the street lamps, the kiosques,

582
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:55,400
the...horse and carriages,

583
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:58,000
and Maxim's then.

584
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,500
You speak very good English.

585
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:04,000
- No, not really.
- No, you do!

586
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,400
How long have you been dating Picasso?

587
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:09,300
My God, did I just say that?

588
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,600
Pardon?

589
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:16,700
I don't mean to...I didn't mean to pry....
Were you born in Paris?

590
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,900
I was born in Bordeaux.

591
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,900
I moved here to study fashion.

592
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,700
But you don't want to hear all this.

593
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,600
Yes, I do.

594
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:31,100
Yes, continue.
You moved here to study fashion...

595
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:35,300
I...came here to study with Coco Chanel,

596
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,800
<i>and I fell in love with Paris,</i>

597
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,800
and also,

598
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:45,400
a very dark-eyed, haunted
Jewish-Italian painter.

599
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:53,800
And I knew Amedeo had another woman, but still,
I couldn't resist moving into his apartment when he asked,

600
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:56,300
and it was a beautiful six months.

601
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,300
M..M...Modigliani?

602
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:03,700
You lived with...
You lived with Modigliani?

603
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:08,500
You asked me,
so I'm telling you my sad story.

604
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:13,300
With Braque, though, there was another woman.

605
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,500
Many.

606
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,200
And now,

607
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,100
with Pablo.

608
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,800
I mean, he's married,
but...

609
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:27,300
every day, it's on-again, off-again.

610
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:32,300
I don't know how any woman
can stay with him. He's so difficult.

611
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:37,600
My God, you take "art groupie"
to a whole new level!

612
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:41,700
- Pardon?
- Nothing. I was just saying that...

613
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,500
But tell me about yourself.

614
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:48,400
- What? Well, what can I say...
- So, have you come to Paris to write?

615
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,700
Because, you know,

616
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:55,600
these days, so many Americans
feel the need to move here.

617
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,900
Isn't Hemingway attractive?

618
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:02,800
I love his writing.

619
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,400
I know. Actually, I'm just here visiting.

620
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,300
Oh, you must stay here.

621
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:12,500
- Really?
- Yeah. It's a wonderful city, for

622
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:17,800
- writers, artists.
- I know. I'd like to, but it's not that easy.

623
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,600
And,

624
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:24,500
I didn't fall in love madly with your book...

625
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:27,000
- Really?
- ...so I want to hear the rest of it.

626
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,600
- You really like? Because I'm still kind of tinkering...
- Pender?

627
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:35,800
- Yeah, let's go up to Montmartre. Let's get a drink, OK?
- Uh...yeah.

628
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:40,100
I'll discuss your book with you as soon as I've finished it.
Where can I reach you?

629
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:44,200
Why don't I drop back by, instead of you
trying to find me, if that's all right?

630
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,400
- We run an open house.
- Are you coming with us?

631
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:51,900
I wish that I could.
I cant, but

632
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:54,700
hopefully I'll see you again eventually.

633
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,800
That would be nice.

634
00:39:56,900 --> 00:40:00,000
- Let's go!
- One of these days, I plan to steal you away from this genius

635
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,500
who's great, but he's no MirÃ³.

636
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,800
I'm Gil Pender.

637
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:25,000
I was with Hemingway, and Picasso.

638
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:29,100
Pablo Picasso, and Ernest Hemingway.

639
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:33,300
I'm Gil Pender, from Pasadena!

640
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:37,700
Cub Scouts. I failed freshman English.

641
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:41,300
Little old Gil Pender has his novel

642
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,900
with Gertrude. Stein.

643
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,200
Boy, that girl was so...

644
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,800
lovely.

645
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,900
Well, it's a shame you two didn't
come to the movies with us last night,

646
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:59,600
We saw a wonderfully
funny American film.

647
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,200
Who was in it?

648
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,100
Oh, I don't know.
I forget the name.

649
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,700
Wonderful but forgettable.
That sounds like a picture I've seen.

650
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,100
I probably wrote it.

651
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:11,000
Well, I know it was moronic and infantile, and

652
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,600
utterly lacking in any wit or believability,

653
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,900
- but John and I laughed in spite of all that.
- Have we been down this way yet?

654
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,800
Was it?

655
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,700
What time did you get in last night?

656
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,400
Not that late...uh...
I was...uh...

657
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:27,800
I'm really finding these midnight strolls
great for me creatively,

658
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,800
without the distractions of the day.
I'll probably end up going on another little

659
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:33,900
- hike tonight.
- Well, we'll see.

660
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:36,300
Yeah. We'll see.

661
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,900
Oh, look at those wonderful glass figures.

662
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:44,700
<i>[Cole Porter's "You Do Something to Me"]
âª ...that simply mystifies me âª</i>

663
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:50,600
<i>âª Tell me why should it be  âª</i>

664
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:56,800
<i>âª You have the power to hypnotize me âª</i>

665
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,400
<i>Vous aimez?
(You like?)</i>

666
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,500
Yes. Very beautiful.

667
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,500
- Oh. You're American.
- Yeah.

668
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,500
You like Cole Porter?

669
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:07,600
I do. I'm a big fan.
I like to

670
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:11,500
kind of think I'm a member
of Linda and Cole's inner circle.

671
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,400
I'm kidding.

672
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,800
Very pretty lyrics.

673
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,800
- Very amusing.
- Charming.

674
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,200
Gil?

675
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:27,600
- Gil? Hi.
- Yeah? Yes.

676
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,900
- Yeah. We should go.
- We're going now?

677
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,300
Yeah. We're meeting Paul and Carol
at the museum for the private showing.

678
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,600
- OK. Yeah. Right.

679
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:37,200
You know, Paul happens to be an expert in Monet,

680
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:39,100
so you'll find it enlightening, I think.

681
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,200
Yeah. OK.

682
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:43,000
Let's get some culture.

683
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:46,600
The juxtaposition of color is amazing.

684
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:49,100
This man was the real father

685
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
of abstract expressionism.

686
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:53,100
I take that back.
Maybe Turner.

687
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,900
I mean, I love Turner,

688
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:57,900
but, I just find this...

689
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,000
overwhelming.

690
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:02,200
If I'm not mistaken,
it took him 2 years to complete this.

691
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:05,300
He worked out of Giverny,
where he was frequently...

692
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,400
I heard that Monet,
one of the things that he used to try to...

693
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,900
Shh! I'm trying to hear Paul say it.

694
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:13,100
Well, he was frequently
visited by Caillebotte,

695
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,100
an artist who I personally feel was underrated.

696
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,300
Ah. Now.

697
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,500
Here's a superb Picasso.

698
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,600
If I'm not mistaken, he painted
this marvelous portrait of his

699
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,100
French mistress
Madeleine Brissou in the '20s.

700
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,400
Paul, I'm gonna have to
differ with you on this one.

701
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:33,600
- Really.
- Gil, just pay attention.

702
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,100
You might learn something.

703
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,100
OK, well, if I'm not mistaken,

704
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,600
this was a failed attempt to capture

705
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:42,300
a young French girl named Adriana,

706
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:45,300
from Bordeaux, if my art history serves me,

707
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:49,300
who came to Paris to study
costume design for the theater.

708
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:53,000
I'm pretty sure she had an affair
with Modigliani, then Braque,

709
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,500
which is how Pablo met her.
Picasso.

710
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,500
Of course, what you don't get

711
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:00,200
from this portrait
is the subtlety,

712
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:02,600
and her beauty.
She was just a knock-out.

713
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,400
What have you been smoking?

714
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:09,100
I'd hardly call this picture marvelous,

715
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,300
it's more of a petit-bourgeois statement

716
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:14,200
on how Pablo sees her. Saw her.

717
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:16,700
He's distracted by the fact
that she was a

718
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:19,500
absolute volcano in the sack.

719
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Too rich for me.

720
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,900
Where'd Gil run off to?

721
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,500
Work.

722
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:36,800
Been walking around Paris. You know,

723
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:41,900
the way the city's lit up at night
allegedly inspires him, so...

724
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:45,200
But that's OK,
because I'm going dancing with Paul.

725
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,900
Where's Carol?

726
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,900
uh...She's in bed with a bad oyster,

727
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,200
so I'll see you guys later.

728
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:53,100
Thanks for dinner, Daddy.

729
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,300
Bye, sweetie.

730
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:58,900
Where do you think
Gil goes every night?

731
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,800
You heard her.
He walks, and gets ideas.

732
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,800
- You sound skeptical.
- No.

733
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:08,400
I've seen what he earns,
but sometimes I think he's got a...

734
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,600
got a... part missing,

735
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,600
and I didn't like his remark about

736
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,800
Tea Party Republicans.
They are decent

737
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:15,600
people trying to take back the country.

738
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,500
They are not
crypto-fascist

739
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,400
airhead zombies.
You hear him say that?

740
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:21,900
Nevertheless, I don't think
your idea of having him followed

741
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:24,100
- is very practical.
- No?

742
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:25,900
I'd like to know where he goes every night.

743
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:27,600
Well, we know one thing:

744
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,300
he doesn't go dancing.

745
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,700
Oh! Excuse me!

746
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,600
- Is this gentleman bothering you?
- Hello, Gil!

747
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,000
Hey! How are you?
I was hoping we'd see you here.

748
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:52,500
- What a great party!
- Oh, good.

749
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,400
- It's nice to see you here.
- Thank you.

750
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,400
Oh, Delfine?

751
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,900
- Gil, we'll catch up with you later, OK?
- Sure, sure.

752
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,800
<i>Bon soir, Madame.
(Good evening, Madame.)</i>

753
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:03,300
- What a surprise!
- It was just a total fluke.

754
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,000
I was at Gertrude Stein's,

755
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:07,100
she's almost finished with my novel,
and I run into this guy.

756
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,400
Turns out he's Archibald MacLeish.
He says he's on his way over here,

757
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,100
come on over. Oh, I'm not
going to crash the Fitzgeralds,

758
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,800
but then he said you'd be here.
You and Pablo, and...

759
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:15,300
Oh, Pablo's home.

760
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:18,700
- We had a...bit of a quarrel.
- Oh no!

761
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:22,400
- You look like you were having fun with Djuna Barnes, dancing.
- Oh, yeah!

762
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:24,300
Wait. That was Djuna Barnes?

763
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,700
- Yeah.
- Wow. No wonder she wanted to lead.

764
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:30,500
Isn't this a wonderful
place to throw a party?

765
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:33,700
- It's so great!
- Only the Fitzgeralds can do that!

766
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:36,800
- I want to show you something. Come with me.
- OK.

767
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,900
- So, what about your book?
- It's coming along. Yeah!

768
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,600
Look at that!

769
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:48,100
- Wow!
- It's from the turn of the century.

770
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,300
Isn't it beautiful?
It's my favorite era.

771
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,200
I love it so much.
Everything was so perfect.

772
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:56,100
It's so nice to see you tonight.

773
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,800
- I was hoping to...
- It's so nice to see you!

774
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:00,000
<i>VoilÃ , ma petite Adriana!
(There she is, my little Adriana!)</i>

775
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,800
Isn't this little Parisian
dream a moveable feast?

776
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:06,900
Mark my words.
I'm going to steal you away

777
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,800
from that fugitive from
MÃ¡laga one way or another.

778
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,400
Between Belmonte and myself,
whom would you choose?

779
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,900
<i>Vous Ãªtes tous deux parfaits.
(You are both perfect.)</i>

780
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:16,800
But he has more courage.
He faces death more often, and

781
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,800
more directly, and if you chose him,
I'd be disappointed, but I'd understand.

782
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:21,300
<i>Ella ha elegido Pablo.>
(She chose Pablo.)</i>

783
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,800
Yes, she's chosen Picasso,
but Pablo thinks

784
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:26,400
women are only to sleep
with or to paint.

785
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,800
What about you?

786
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:30,500
I think a woman is equal
to a man in courage.

787
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,000
Have you ever shot
a charging lion?

788
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,600
Never.

789
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,900
Would you like to know
how that feels?

790
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,800
- I don't think so.
- You ever hunted?

791
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:40,100
- No.
- You?

792
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,300
Only for bargains.

793
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,700
<i>TomÃ©monos otra copita.
(Let's take another drink.)</i>

794
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:48,700
You know, it's so loud,
I wonder if we can go some place

795
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:52,700
- where we can hear ourselves think a little bit?
- Sure! Bye.

796
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,700
Who wants a fight?

797
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:58,000
Well, I hope it was nothing
serious with you and Pablo.

798
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:00,500
He's moody and possessive.

799
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,300
Artists are like children.

800
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:05,400
Well, you certainly understand why
all these guys want to paint you,

801
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:08,400
'cause you have just about
one of the best faces ever.

802
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:11,300
- It's so interesting...
- Oh?

803
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:15,600
- You're interesting, too, in a lost way.
- Lost?

804
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,200
Well, I guess I am lost.

805
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:20,100
Tell me more about your book.

806
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:23,200
My book is kind of a...

807
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:27,700
You know what?
I couldn't care less about my book tonight.

808
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,700
I just want to walk around Paris with you.

809
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:32,600
I keep forgetting you're just a tourist.

810
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:34,600
That's putting it mildly.

811
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,700
I can never decide whether

812
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:40,300
Paris is more beautiful by day or by night.

813
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,300
No, you can't.
You couldn't pick one. I mean,

814
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:46,000
I can give you a checkmate
argument for each side.

815
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:49,000
You know, I sometimes think,
"How's anyone gonna come up with a

816
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:50,900
book, or a painting, or a

817
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:54,300
symphony or a sculpture that can
compete with a great city?"

818
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,700
You can't, 'cause, like,
you look around, every...

819
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:00,500
every street, every boulevard
is its own special art form.

820
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:03,600
And when you think that in the cold,

821
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:07,900
violent, meaningless universe,
that Paris exists, these lights...

822
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:11,700
I mean, come on, there's nothing
happening on Jupiter or Neptune,

823
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:14,600
but from way out in space
you can see these lights,

824
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:18,600
the cafÃ©s, people drinking, and singing...

825
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:23,000
I mean, for all we know,
Paris is the hottest spot in the universe.

826
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,100
<i>- Vous Ãªtes un poÃ¨te.(You are a poet.)
- Aw, come on.</i>

827
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:30,400
It's just... You're very kind,
but I wouldn't call my babbling poetic.

828
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,900
Although I was on a pretty good roll there.

829
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,900
See anything you like?

830
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:38,400
Yeah. I'm ashamed to admit
I'm attracted to all of them.

831
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:41,600
I like cheap sexy.
That makes me shallow.

832
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:45,400
When I was in Catholic school,
one weekend

833
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:48,700
my roommate and I,
we paid a girl from Pigalle

834
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:52,000
to come and teach us all her tricks.

835
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:54,000
- Honestly?
- Yeah.

836
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:55,900
Wow. That's...

837
00:49:56,300 --> 00:50:02,200
That's...That's...
I'm going to be thinking about that one.

838
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:11,100
I love walking with you.

839
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,300
- You look amazing.
- Thank you.

840
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:19,900
God, is that who I think it is?

841
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:22,400
What is she doing here,
staring into the water?

842
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:24,700
Oh my God!

843
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Zelda, what are you doing?!

844
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:29,500
- Please? I don't want to live!
- Stop!

845
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:32,400
- What is it?
- Scott and that beautiful countess.

846
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:35,100
They were-- It was so obvious
they were whispering about me,

847
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,500
and the more they drank,
the more he fell in love with her!

848
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:40,100
He...Scott loves only you.

849
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:42,400
- I can tell you that with absolute certainty.
- No.

850
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:45,000
- He's tired of me!
- You're wrong. You're wrong. I know.

851
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,500
- How?
- Trust me. I know.

852
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,900
- Sometimes you get a feel for people, and I get...
- My skin hurts!

853
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:55,200
- What do you mean?
- I don't wanna...I hate the way I look!

854
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Don't do that!

855
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:00,400
- Here. Take this.
- What is this?

856
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:02,300
It's a Valium.
It'll make you feel better.

857
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,600
- You carry medicine?
- No, not normally.

858
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,400
It's just since I've been engaged to Inez,

859
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:11,000
I've been having panic attacks,
but I'm sure they'll subside after the wedding.

860
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:13,400
I've never heard of Valium.
What is this?

861
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:16,800
It's the...pill of the future.

862
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,900
You never said you were getting married.

863
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,200
Yeah. You know,
it's still a....

864
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:28,800
ways in the future.

865
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:32,900
- Well, good luck with your book, and your wedding.
- Thank you.

866
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:35,200
I think you'd like Inez.
She has a...

867
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:37,700
has a very sharp sense of humor, and

868
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:41,900
she's attractive. She doesn't say
that we agree on everything, but...

869
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:44,000
But the important things.

870
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:46,000
Yeah, or...actually,

871
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
maybe the small things. The...

872
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:51,400
Sometimes there's a little bit
of a disconnect with the big things.

873
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,700
She wants to live in Malibu, and

874
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:56,500
wants me to work in Hollywood, and....

875
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,600
But I will say that we both like

876
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,100
Indian food.
Not all Indian food, but the...

877
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:05,000
you know...the pita bread.

878
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:08,200
We both like pita bread.
I guess it's called naan.

879
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,100
I should go.

880
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,000
Pablo will be missing me.

881
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:15,200
- Come on. I'll walk you home.
- No. No. No.

882
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:17,500
Just finish your drink.
I live just around the corner.

883
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:21,800
- No. Come on. I'm not gonna...
- Well, I...I...prefer to be by myself for a while,

884
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:25,600
but thank you for the evening.
Bye.

885
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:30,800
<i>Monsieur? C'est un dommage.
(Sir? It's a shame.)</i>

886
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:32,700
<i>C'est un dommage.
(It's a shame.)</i>

887
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:35,300
We met, earlier tonight...

888
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,400
At the party!

889
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,300
<i>DalÃ­, sÃ­?
(DalÃ­, yes?)</i>

890
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:41,700
- Yes...
- DalÃ­!

891
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:44,700
- I remember!
- DalÃ­. Ya.

892
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,200
<i>Un bouteille de vin rouge!
(A bottle of red wine!)</i>

893
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,400
It can't be...
Yeah....

894
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,300
So?

895
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,700
<i>Un autre verre pour monsieur, s'il vous plaÃ®t.
(Another glass for this man, please.)</i>

896
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:59,300
I love the language!

897
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:03,500
The French!
The waiters? No.

898
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:07,800
You like the shape of the rhinoceros?

899
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:10,600
The rhinoceros? Uh...

900
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:13,300
Haven't really thought about it.

901
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:17,800
I paint the rhinoceros.
I paint you.

902
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:20,700
<i>SÃ­. Your sad eyes.</i>

903
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:25,200
Your big lips, melting over the hot sand,

904
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:27,400
with one tear.

905
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:31,900
Yes! And in your tear,
another face.

906
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:34,300
The Christ's face!

907
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:37,400
Yes, in the rhinoceros.

908
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:40,500
Yeah. I mean, I probably do look sad. I'm in...

909
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:43,700
a very perplexing situation.

910
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:48,600
<>Diablo...Luis! Oye, Luis!
(Damn. Luis! Hey, Luis!)

911
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:51,000
My friends.

912
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:53,800
This... SeÃ±or BuÃ±uel.

913
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:57,800
- BuÃ±uel?
- SÃ­. BuÃ±uel...and...Mr. Man Ray.

914
00:53:57,700 --> 00:54:00,500
- Man Ray? My Gosh!
- How 'bout that?

915
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:04,200
This is Pen-der. Pen-der.

916
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,300
Pender!

917
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:09,500
- Yes. And I am DalÃ­!
- DalÃ­. Yes.

918
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:11,300
You have to remember.

919
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:14,500
Pender is in a perplexing situation.

920
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,500
It sounds so crazy to say.

921
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:20,000
You guys are going to think I'm drunk, but

922
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:22,000
I have to tell someone. I'm...

923
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,900
from a...

924
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,200
a different time. Another era.

925
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:28,900
The future. OK? I come...

926
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,700
from the 2000th millenium to here.

927
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:35,500
I get in a car, and I slide through time.

928
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:37,200
Exactly correct.

929
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,300
You inhabit two worlds.

930
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:42,100
- So far, I see nothing strange.
- Why?

931
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,600
Yeah, you're surrealists!

932
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:46,100
But I'm a normal guy.
See, in one life,

933
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,500
I'm engaged to marry a woman I love.

934
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,700
At least, I think I love her.

935
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:53,300
Christ! I better love her!
I'm marrying her!

936
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,700
The rhinoceros makes love

937
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:58,300
by mounting the female.

938
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:00,200
But...

939
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:02,400
is there a difference

940
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:05,900
in the beauty between two

941
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:08,200
rhinoceroses?

942
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:10,300
There is another woman?

943
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:13,700
Adriana. Yes, and I'm...

944
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:15,900
very drawn to her.

945
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:19,100
I find her extremely alluring.

946
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,700
The problem is that other men,

947
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:26,500
great artists - geniuses -
also find her alluring,

948
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,900
and she finds them.
So, there's that...

949
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:33,700
A man in love with a woman
from a different era.

950
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:35,400
I see a photograph.

951
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,600
I see a film.

952
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:40,600
I see an insurmountable problem.

953
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,400
I see...

954
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:45,200
...a rhinoceros.

955
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:46,900
Did you get any work done last night?

956
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:49,700
Yeah...I just....
I'm starting to think that maybe my

957
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,200
book is too realistic.

958
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:54,400
That I'm missing some chances
to let my imagination kind of

959
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:58,600
go crazy, and not be so
damn logical.

960
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:02,000
- Why do you always look so good in the morning?
- No. No. No. No!

961
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,200
- We have to get dressed!
- Just for a second!

962
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:07,200
Come here! I've been working like a demon.
I gotta get this stuff done, but

963
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:11,500
I can't resist you any more.
You're so fetching in the morning.

964
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,500
Paul said we have to go to the countryside.

965
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:17,000
You know? He said he's taking us
to this beautiful little inn for lunch.

966
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:20,100
But, I mean, if you don't want to go,
don't go.

967
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:22,100
I'm not missing it because of you.

968
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:41,300
<i>Hello! Bonjour!</i>

969
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:44,800
- Hello! I have a quick question for you about Rodin.
- Hello.

970
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:47,700
OK, now, I understand
he loved his wife

971
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:49,800
and he also loved his mistress.

972
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:51,400
- Yes.
- But do you think that's possible,

973
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:53,300
to love two women at once?

974
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:56,800
Well, he loved them both,
but in a different way.

975
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,600
You know...

976
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:00,900
That's very...
That's very French.

977
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:03,600
You guys are way...
you know...much...

978
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,400
more evolved in that department
than we are.

979
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:08,600
Do you remember me?
I was in the...

980
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:10,800
- was in the group that...
- Yes!

981
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:13,100
The group with the pedantic gentleman.

982
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:17,100
Pedantic? Yes.
That's a perfect word.

983
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:28,300
Here is ... his photo.

984
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:30,300
I want to know where
he goes each night.

985
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:33,100
What is your suspicion? Hm?

986
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,500
He's engaged to my daughter.

987
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,400
To marry. I want to make sure
that she's making the right decision.

988
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:39,700
Naturally, discretion is paramount.

989
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:42,100
<i>Well, you've come to the
right place, Monsieur.</i>

990
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,100
Monsieur Tisserant will personally
keep track of the gentleman,

991
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:49,000
and report about his whereabouts at night.

992
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,300
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey!

993
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:13,000
Hey! Thank you for stopping.

994
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:15,900
- Gil Pender.
- Tom Eliot.

995
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:19,200
Tom Eliot?
Tom Stearns Eliot?

996
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:22,400
T.S Eliot? T.S. Eliot?

997
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:25,700
<i>- Pender.
- Prufrock's like my mantra!</i>

998
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:27,600
OK. Sorry. Sorry.

999
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:35,900
Listen. Where I come from,

1000
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:40,500
people measure out their lives
with coke spoons.

1001
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:43,000
- Hello? Ms. Stein?
- Oh, Pender.

1002
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:45,000
I'll get to your book in a moment.
I finished it.

1003
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:47,200
We're just in the middle
of a little personal crisis.

1004
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:49,700
Oh, OK. Should I come back?
I don't want to interrupt.

1005
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:51,700
No, it's no secret.

1006
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:55,100
Adriana has left Pablo,
and has flown to Africa with Hemingway.

1007
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,700
<i>SabÃ­a que tenÃ­a obsesiÃ³n con este fanfarrÃ³n!
(I knew that I had an obsession with that bully!)</i>

1008
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,200
<i>Ya hemos hablado de todo esto!
(We talked about all this!)</i>

1009
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:02,700
<i>Estoy segura de que ella regresarÃ¡ muy devoto.
(I'm sure that she'll come back very devoted.)</i>

1010
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:06,000
<i>Muy devoto. Oh, he took her hunting kudu,
but she'll be back to him.</i>

1011
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:10,800
The sound of hyenas in your ears at night when
you're trying to sleep in a tent just drives you crazy.

1012
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:13,000
Mount Kilimanjaro is not Paris.

1013
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,300
- What are you saying, that he took her to Mount Kilimanjaro?
- Now, about your book,

1014
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,100
it's very unusual, indeed.

1015
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:21,800
I mean, in a way, it's almost like science fiction.

1016
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:25,300
We all fear death,
and question our place in the universe.

1017
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:28,600
The artist's job is not to succumb to despair,

1018
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:32,100
but to find an antidote for
the emptiness of existence.

1019
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:36,600
You have a clear and lively voice.
Don't be such a defeatist.

1020
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:43,300
Tell Gil to bring his suit, 'cause we're
going to be dining formal tomorrow night.

1021
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:47,000
I forgot to tell you, actually.
Gil isn't coming to Mont Saint-Michel.

1022
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:49,600
Why not?
I don't understand it!

1023
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:51,400
Because, he writes.
He rewrites.

1024
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:53,400
He rewrites the rewrites, you know?

1025
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:55,100
He says, "Picasso never left his studio."

1026
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,900
I said, "Gil, you have absolutely
nothing in common with Picasso."

1027
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:59,600
He just looks at me.

1028
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:02,700
Well, he's gonna miss a great weekend.

1029
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:08,500

You have any Cole Porter?</i>

1035
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:32,300
- Hi.
- Hey.

1036
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:34,200
- I remember you.
- Yeah?

1037
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:36,700
- He was your friend.
- Cole Porter? Yeah.

1038
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:40,200
And don't forget about Linda.
She was a friend, too.

1039
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:43,400
- You realize I was kidding?
- Yeah. I did realize.

1040
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:44,500
You're a bit young.

1041
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:49,600
Yeah. You seem a bit young
to be so familiar with his work.

1042
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:52,600
It's because he wrote
many songs about Paris.

1043
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:57,000
Yeah. What was the story? It was like he was
in love with your hometown, or something.

1044
01:00:56,800 --> 01:01:00,700
- Are you a Parisian?
- Yes, monsieur.

1045
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:05,800
"Yes, monsieur." Feel free to call me Gil.

1046
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:08,900
- What do I owe you?

Whoa! Oh my God!
What are you guys doing?

1078
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,200
Daddy had chest pains.

1079
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:10,400
- Oh, really?
- Yeah. I'm sure it's just indigestion.

1080
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:13,900
- We can't take that chance.
- You know he had an angioplasty 3 years ago.

1081
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:15,300
Yeah. Right.

1082
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:17,200
They put a balloon in me.
Big deal.

1083
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:20,900
- Balloon?
- I would like the hotel doctor, please, in room 728.

1084
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:23,000
Don't call the doctor!

1085
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,600
Gil, why are you so dressed up?

1086
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:27,400
Me? No, no, no, I'm not.
I've been writing.

1087
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:29,100
I was just doing a little writing.

1088
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,300
Wh...You dress up and
put on cologne to write?

1089
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:34,100
No, no. I jumped in the shower,

1090
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,900
just for a second. You know
how I think better in the shower,

1091
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:39,500
and I get the positive ions going in there?

1092
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:41,100
So, we were halfway to Mont Saint-Michel

1093
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,400
when Daddy just...
he went pale as a ghost.

1094
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:45,500
- That's terrible!
- I mean, it was so scary, so we just

1095
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:47,900
- turned right around and came back.
- Yeah. You had to.

1096
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:51,700
John, is there anything I can get,
for your color to me looks

1097
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:54,000
- like it's OK, but I'm not a doctor.
- Naw, I'm fine.

1098
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:56,500
I'm sure it's the
beef bourguignon she made me have.

1099
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:59,200
- What is that?
- Where?

1100
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:02,300
- That in your hand.
- Nothing.

1101
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:04,700
- That was a present!
- I know. I know.

1102
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:07,400
I mean, it's not...It...It is!

1103
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:08,500
<i>- Pour moi? (For me?)
- Yes.</i>

1104
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:11,400
It's not...incredible....
It's from the flea market.

1105
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:12,700
- Well, can I open it?
- No, no no,

1106
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:17,300
That's what I'm saying.
Honey, it's for a special dinner

1107
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:19,100
that we're gonna have,
then I'm going to give it to you.

1108
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:23,500
- Is it jewelry? I hope it's my taste, if it's jewelry, because...
- Well...

1109
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:26,900
- ...that moonstone necklace?
- But I thought you liked the moon?

1110
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:29,700
Because it's understated, but elegant.

1111
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:31,500
That's what you always say.

1112
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:33,800
Cheap is cheap,
is what I always say.

1113
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:35,300
Yeah. You didn't see this necklace.

1114
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:39,000
I've never actually even worn it.
I'll show you. You'll see why immediately.

1115
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:42,600
- Everybody's down on moonstone, all of a sudden.
- Well...

1116
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:45,100
- they are...
- A little simple.

1117
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,500
I think... I thought
you loved their simplicity.

1118
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:49,900
Yeah, that's the problem.
They're too simple.

1119
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:52,700
Well, what do I know?
Too simple.

1120
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:55,900
Where are my pearl earrings?

1121
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:59,500
Did...Did you bring them?

1122
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:02,000
I don't even remember you packing them.

1123
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:04,600
Yes, I did, because I've worn them here!

1124
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,900
No, you didn't.
Oh, they must've fallen out!

1125
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:09,400
Both of them?
Gil, my ears are pierced.

1126
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:12,500
Inez, I told you to keep
everything in the hotel safe!

1127
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:14,900
- Do you think it was the maid?
- It's always the maid.

1128
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,800
I...I know I saw them
here this morning.

1129
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:19,100
Well, I would report the theft right away.

1130
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,400
You know, she was so snotty
yesterday when I asked her...

1131
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:23,600
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Let's not
jump to any conclusions, OK?

1132
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:26,800
- You don't just level a charge of theft against somebody.
- Yes, I'd like to report a theft.

1133
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:30,000
- Shh, Inez, no!
- Could you call the house detective?

1134
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:32,300
- Send him up. Thank you.
- This is turning into a witch hunt!

1135
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:34,100
You don't do this to people!

1136
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,600
Yes, you do,
if they've stolen.

1137
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:38,200
I didn't like that maid.
I didn't like her from the beginning.

1138
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:40,700
She was sweet. She was pleasant.
She was upbeat!

1139
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:43,300
You always take the
side of the help, as usual!

1140
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,800
That's why Daddy says you're a communist.

1141
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:49,200
<i>Bon soir. (Good evening.)
I'm Doctor GÃ©rard.</i>

1142
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:51,500
- Do you want some more water?
- I'm fine.

1143
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:56,800
- He's had angioplasty.
- I didn't need it.

1144
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:02,000
Look! Are these them?

1145
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:03,900
I don't know.

1146
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:07,200
- Where did you find them?
- They were just in the bathroom.

1147
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:09,100
- In the bathroom?
- Yeah. On the sink.

1148
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,200
What the hell were they
doing in the bathroom?

1149
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:14,300
I don't know.
They were just...

1150
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:17,500
But maybe you dropped them, and

1151
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:21,600
when you were putting them away,
and the housekeeper must've picked them up.

1152
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:24,300
and placed them there, out in
the open where we could see them easily.

1153
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:26,200
That was really thoughtful of her.

1154
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:28,000
I didn't drop them.
I wouldn't drop them.

1155
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:29,900
The important thing is
they're not stolen.

1156
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,600
<i>C'est l'un de vos meilleurs, jusqu'au prÃ©sent.

1158
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,300
Oh, Pender!
I was just telling Matisse

1159
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:06,600
we're going to buy one of his
paintings for our personal collection.

1160
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,800
I think 500 Francs is fair.

1161
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:11,100
500 Francs for a Matisse?

1162
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:12,900
Yeah, I think that sounds fair.

1163
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:15,400
You know, I was wondering if
maybe I could pick up 6 or 7.

1164
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:17,200
- What have we got here?
- Yeah. Oh.

1165
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:20,000
OK, now, I've brought a rewrite over
of the first few chapters of my book,

1166
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:24,300
and if you could just tell me if I'm
heading in the right direction, I'd really appreciate it.

1167
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:26,000
- Leave it with me.
- OK. Great.

1168
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:27,800
and have you heard from Hemingway?

1169
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:30,100
Oh, they've been back for days, now.

1170
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,300
The trip didn't work out.
I knew they wouldn't hit it off.

1171
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:35,200
It's over. With Picasso, too.

1172
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:37,600
She's at Deyrolle, by herself.

1173
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:38,400
By herself?

1174
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:41,400
Oh, one of those crazy
Surrealist painters is getting married.

1175
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:43,200
They're doing it up there.

1176
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:45,400
She'll be glad to see you.

1177
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:50,300
<i>Eh bien, mes chers amies, je propose de porter un toast...
(Well, my dear friends, I propose to raise a toast to...)</i>

1178
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:20,800
Oh. What are you doing here?

1179
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:22,700
I came to find you.

1180
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:26,700
- You did?
- Yeah. Maybe this is coming out of left field, but

1181
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:30,300
let's just say, as a writer,
I'm pretty good at

1182
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:34,100
picking up on vibrations from people-
women in particular.

1183
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:38,500
I sense that there are
some complicated feelings, maybe,

1184
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:41,200
that you have for me.

1185
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:43,300
Aren't you gonna get married?

1186
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:46,100
Well, everything's a little
up in the air right now.

1187
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,800
I don't know what is gonna happen.

1188
01:09:48,900 --> 01:09:52,200
Is there some place that we
can talk? Maybe more quiet?

1189
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,600
- Sure.
- Come on.

1190
01:09:55,300 --> 01:09:56,900
Oh, Mr. BuÃ±uel!

1191
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:59,300
I had a nice idea
for a movie for you.

1192
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:01,700
- Yes?
- A group of people attend a

1193
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:07,200
very formal dinner party. At the end of dinner,
when they try to leave the room, they can't.

1194
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:09,100
Why not?

1195
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:12,500
They just can't seem to exit the door.

1196
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,000
<i>- B...But why?
- Well, momento,</i>

1197
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:19,000
when they're forced to stay together,
the veneer of civilization

1198
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:22,600
quickly fades away,
and what you're left with is

1199
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:25,500
who they really are:  animals.

1200
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:27,200
But I don't get it.

1201
01:10:27,100 --> 01:10:29,100
Why don't they just
walk out of the room?

1202
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:30,600
All I'm saying is just think about.
Who knows?

1203
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:34,200
Maybe when you're shaving one day,
it'll tickle your fancy.

1204
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:38,000
I don't understand.
What's holding them in the room?

1205
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:16,700
What are you doing?

1206
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:20,400
I don't know!

1207
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:29,800
I did feel,
for a minute there,

1208
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:33,800
while I was doing it, like I was immortal.

1209
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:36,100
But you look so sad.

1210
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,400
Because life is too mysterious.

1211
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:41,800
This is the time we live in.

1212
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:44,700
Everything moves so fast.

1213
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:48,400
Life is noisy and complicated.

1214
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:52,000
I've always been a logical person.
I've never

1215
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:53,500
I never acted too crazy.

1216
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:57,000
I didn't stay here.
When I first came out here,

1217
01:11:56,800 --> 01:12:00,900
I didn't take a real shot at being a writer.

1218
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:04,700
I'd just, kind of, be a hired Hollywood hand.

1219
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:07,700
Don't laugh. I just want to...

1220
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:10,700
I feel like I just want to let it go.

1221
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,900
- Here.
- Oh!

1222
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:21,800
Oh! This is...
This is remarkable!

1223
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:24,200
Go on. Here, put in on.

1224
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:26,100
They're so beautiful!

1225
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:34,300
Look!

1226
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:41,600
<i>Monsieur, Mademoiselle, on y va!
(Sir, Miss, away we go!)</i>

1227
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:45,600
<i>- Qui est vous? (Who are you?)
- Allez monter. Nous allons trop tard. (Come up. We're too late)</i>

1228
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,700
<i>- Allez!
- Come on! Come on!</i>

1229
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:08,100
<i>Oh, mon Dieu,
this is so beautiful!</i>

1230
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:11,800
It's unbelievable!
All the pictures I've seen...

1231
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:13,600
<i>Here it is: La Belle Ãpoque!</i>

1232
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:17,200
Wow! I don't know
what it is about this city!

1233
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:21,300
It's like, I've got to write a note
to the Chamber of Commerce.

1234
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,900
<i>Bon soir!
(Good evening!)</i>

1235
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:30,100
<i>Bon soir! Bienvenue.
(Good evening! Welcome.)</i>

1236
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Thank you.

1237
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,900
<i>Oh, mon Dieu! Quelle robe magnifique!
(Oh, my God! What a magnificent dress!)</i>

1238
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:36,500
<i>Tellement avant-garde!
(So ahead of the time!)</i>

1239
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:42,500
<i>S'il vous plaÃ®t, prenez un boire du champagne. C'est la fÃªte!
(Please, have a drink of champagne. It's a party!)</i>

1240
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:44,800
<i>Champagne.</i>

1241
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:16,300
Isn't it amazing? The first time we met,
I told you about this place,

1242
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:18,100
<i>and the Belle Ãpoque,</i>

1243
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:20,000
and here we are!

1244
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:22,900
I don't know why,
but I have this feeling that...

1245
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:24,800
I don't know, like I can't...

1246
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:27,300
believe my luck.

1247
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:31,100
Well, I can. I know exactly where I want to go next.

1248
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:32,900
You lead the way.

1249
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:11,100
Look!

1250
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:14,700
Oh, my God!

1251
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:17,400
Pablo admires him so much!

1252
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:19,400
- I have to say hello.
- No, maybe we shouldn't bother him.

1253
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:21,100
- Come with me! I'm nervous.
- Really? OK.

1254
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,400
But, we know he's a lonely man.

1255
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:27,400
- I'm sure he would love some company.
- OK, let's go.

1256
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:31,000
Monsieur Lautrec?

1257
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:34,100
<i>- Oui? (Yes?)
- Bon soir. Nous sommes de grands amateurs.(Good evening. We are great fans.)</i>

1258
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:37,500
<i>- Merci, Madame. (Thank you, Madame.)
- Pouvons-nous vous offrir un verre? (May we offer you a drink?)</i>

1259
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:41,000
<i>Je serais enchantÃ©e. Prenez un siÃ¨ge.
(I would be delighted. Have a seat.)</i>

1260
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:42,900
He's asking us to sit down with him.

1261
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:46,300
This much French I do
understand, and the gesture.

1262
01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:47,300
<i>Vous Ãªtes Americain?
(You are American?)</i>

1263
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:48,800
Yes, I'm an American.

1264
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:52,000
<i>Je vous devine Ã  l'accent.(I could tell from the accent.)
- Yeah. Oui. Oui.</i>

1265
01:15:51,900 --> 01:15:55,400
<i>Vos dessins! Votre attention! Nous admirons tout que vous faites.
(Your drawings! Your attention! We admire everything that you do.)</i>

1266
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:57,700
<i>- I love your drawings, also.
- Bon soir!
- Merci.</i>

1267
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,900
<i>Savez que moi je prÃ©senter Monsieur Gauginand Monsieur Degas.
(May I present Mr. Gaugin and Mr. Degas.)</i>

1268
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:06,600
- Bon soir.
- EnchantÃ©e.
- Bon soir. EnchantÃ©e.

1269
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:11,200
- Paul Gaugin.
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

1270
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:14,100
See the sketch he's made?
Nobody can draw like this today.

1271
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Not Picasso. Not Matisse.

1272
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:18,200
<i>Unbelievable. Parlez-vous anglais?</i>

1273
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:20,100
<i>- Non, monsieur. (No, sir.)
- Il parle un petit peu.(He speaks a little.)</i>

1274
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:24,200
<i>Non, non. I speak well. Parle trÃ¨s bien. Bien oui. Tu veut voir? 
(No, no. I speak very well. Absolutely. You want to see?)</i>

1275
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,500
Degas and I were just
talking about how this...

1276
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:32,900
<i>um...this...cette...gÃ©nÃ©ration est plus vide, et il manque d'imagination.
(...this generation is empty, and is missing imagination.)</i>

1277
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,900
He said...He says that

1278
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:39,300
this generation is empty,
and has no imagination.

1279
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:43,400
<i>Better to have lived during the...
la Renaissance.</i>

1280
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:46,300
No! This is the golden age.

1281
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:47,800
<i>- Non.
- C'est l'Ã¢ge d'or!(It's the golden age!)</i>

1282
01:16:47,700 --> 01:16:50,600
<i>Pas de tout. La Renaissance, c'est beaucoup mieux.
(Not at all. The Renaissance is much better.)</i>

1283
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:53,600
<i>Qu'est-ce que vous faites dans la vie?
(What is it you do?)</i>

1284
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:56,100
<i>J'Ã©tudie la haute-couture.
(I study high fashion.)</i>

1285
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,200
<i>C'est pour Ã§a vous Ãªtes ****(That's why you're dressed like that.)</i>

1286
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:01,500
<i>Je comprends maintenant!
(I understand now!)</i>

1287
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:03,400
<i>Les vÃªtements tres jeune.
(The youthful clothes.)</i>

1288
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,600
<i>Voulez vous de lui prÃ©senter Ã  Richard?
(Would you introduce her to Richard?)</i>

1289
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:11,000
<i>- Ah, oui! (Oh, yes!)
- Ah, oui. He wants to have you meet his friend Richard.</i>

1290
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:14,300
He's looking for someone
to do costumes for the new ballet.

1291
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:15,700
<i>So, vous intÃ©resse?
(So, you're interested?)</i>

1292
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:17,600
- Ballet costumes?
- Yes.

1293
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:19,300
Oh my God! I...

1294
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:21,400
I don't live here.

1295
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:23,100
I mean, I do, but I don't. I...

1296
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,200
It's best not to go
into too many details. We're...

1297
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:28,100
We're temporarily
passing through.

1298
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:31,700
Can I speak with you a minute?

1299
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:35,500
<i>PermitÃ©e?
(May I?)</i>

1300
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:38,200
<i>EnchantÃ©..</i>

1301
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:42,400
Wow, it didn't take
Gaugin long to start steaming in.

1302
01:17:42,300 --> 01:17:44,500
Let's never go back to the '20s!

1303
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:46,400
- What are you talking about?
- We should stay here.

1304
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:48,900
It's the start of La Belle Ãpoque!

1305
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:53,600
It's the greatest, most
beautiful era Paris has ever known.

1306
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:57,300
Yeah, but about the '20s,
and the Charleston,

1307
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:59,200
and the Fitzgeralds,
and the Hemingways?

1308
01:17:59,100 --> 01:18:01,500
I mean, I love those guys.

1309
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:05,400
But it's the present.
It's dull.

1310
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:07,500
Dull?

1311
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:09,800
It's not my present.

1312
01:18:09,700 --> 01:18:12,000
I'm from 2010.

1313
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:16,400
What do you mean?

1314
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:20,700
I dropped in on you the same way
we're dropping in on the 1890s.

1315
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:22,900
You did?

1316
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:26,400
I was trying to escape my present
the same way you're trying to escape yours,

1317
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:28,300
to a golden age.

1318
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:33,200
Surely you don't think
the '20s are a golden age!

1319
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,500
Well, yeah. To me they are.

1320
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:39,700
But I'm from the '20s, and I'm
telling you the golden age is La Belle Ãpoque.

1321
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:44,900
And look at these guys. I mean, to them,
their golden age was the Renaissance.

1322
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:49,200
<i>You know, they're trade Belle Ãpoque
to be painting alongside</i>

1323
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,800
Titian and Michelango.

1324
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,800
And those guys probably imagined

1325
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:55,700
life was a lot better
when Kublai Khan was around.

1326
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:59,500
You see, I'm having an insight right now.
It's a minor one, but

1327
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:02,600
it explains the anxiety in my dream that I had.

1328
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:05,100
- What dream?
- I had a dream the other night, where

1329
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,700
it was like a nightmare,
where I ran out of Zithromax.

1330
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:10,800
And then I went to the dentist,
and he didn't have any Novocaine.

1331
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:12,600
You see what I'm saying?

1332
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:16,100
These people don't have any antibiotics.

1333
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,200
What are you talking about?

1334
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:21,400
Adriana, if you stay here,
and this becomes your present,

1335
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:26,500
then, pretty soon, you'll start
imagining another time was really your,

1336
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:28,600
you know, was really the golden time.

1337
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:30,800
That's what the present is.

1338
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:35,400
That it's a little unsatisfying,
because life's a little unsatisfying.

1339
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:38,300
That's the problem with writers.

1340
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:40,700
You are so full of words.

1341
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:43,300
But I am more emotional,

1342
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:44,900
and I'm going stay,

1343
01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:48,900
and live in Paris' most glorious time.

1344
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:52,800
You made a choice to leave
Paris once, and you regretted it.

1345
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:55,000
Yeah, I did regret it.
It was a bad decision,

1346
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:56,200
but at least it was a choice.

1347
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:59,900
I mean, it was a real choice.
This way, I think, is,

1348
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:02,300
I don't know, crazy.
It doesn't really work.

1349
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:06,200
If I ever want to write
something worthwhile, I have to,

1350
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:09,200
you know, get rid of my
illusions, and then I'd be

1351
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:12,500
happier in the past,
as where I want a home.

1352
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:15,300
So...

1353
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:18,100
Goodbye, Gil?

1354
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:30,600
Goodbye.

1355
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:36,400
Pender, I read your rewrite,
and you're nicely on the right track.

1356
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:38,100
You understood me clearly.

1357
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,100
If the rest of the book
reads as well when you're done,

1358
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,500
- you'll have something of value.
- That is the best news!

1359
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:44,800
I really did listen to you,
so I'm happy to hear that it

1360
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,300
You know, it seems like I'm
moving forward.

1361
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:49,000
I mean, it just means
the world to me that you

1362
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:51,000
- Hemingway read the chapters, too, and he thinks...
- He read it?

1363
01:20:50,900 --> 01:20:52,900
...he thinks it's going to be a fine book.

1364
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:55,000
but he did have one plot suggestion.

1365
01:20:54,900 --> 01:20:56,100
What's the suggestion?

1366
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Well, he doesn't quite believe
that the protagonist

1367
01:20:57,900 --> 01:21:02,400
doesn't see that his fiancÃ©e is
having an affair right before his eyes.

1368
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:05,800
- With?
- The other character. The pedantic one.

1369
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:13,700
That's called denial.

1370
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:15,600
Thank you.

1371
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:17,800
You're crazy!

1372
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:19,700
Paul and I?

1373
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:22,300
Where did you get such an insane notion?

1374
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:24,200
Where? From Ernest Hemingway.

1375
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:27,000
He figured it out, and, guess what,
it makes perfect sense.

1376
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:28,900
Gil, your brain tumor's acting up again.

1377
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:31,300
- No. No!
- There's nothing crazy about Hemingway,

1378
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:34,100
or Fitzgerald, or Gertrude Stein,
or Salvador DalÃ­!

1379
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,500
Yeah, except that they've been dead for years!

1380
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:38,300
No, no. The past is not dead.

1381
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:41,000
Actually, it's not even past.
You know who said that?

1382
01:21:40,900 --> 01:21:43,000
Faulkner. And he was right.
And I met him, too.

1383
01:21:42,900 --> 01:21:44,400
I ran into him at a dinner party.

1384
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:46,200
- You're a raving lunatic!
- No, I'm not.

1385
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:48,400
- Yes, you are.
- No. I'm too trusting.

1386
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:50,300
I'm jealous,
and I'm trusting.

1387
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:51,800
It's cognitive dissonance.

1388
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:53,100
- Scott Fitzgerald talked about it.
- Gil. Gil.

1389
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,800
Inez, you can fool me,
but you cannot fool Hemingway.

1390
01:21:55,700 --> 01:21:58,600
- I know.
- Jesus Christ, I'm dealing with a madman here.

1391
01:21:58,500 --> 01:22:01,000
OK. Yes! I did.

1392
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:03,400
I was with Paul for a few nights,

1393
01:22:03,300 --> 01:22:06,600
because he's romantic,
and he speaks French,

1394
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:11,000
and you were always working, and maybe it's
the mystique of this corny city, but...

1395
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:12,800
get over it, Gil.

1396
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:15,900
You just put this in perspective
when we get home.

1397
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:19,700
I'm not...I'm not going back.

1398
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:23,600
- I'm sorry. What?
- I'm staying here, and it has nothing to do with,

1399
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:26,200
you know, your romantic fling;
Paris is Paris.

1400
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:28,400
Inez, you and I, it's obvious we're not...

1401
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:30,800
I don't think we're right for each other.

1402
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:33,800
What?

1403
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:35,700
What are you saying?

1404
01:22:35,700 --> 01:22:38,400
What are you even talking about?

1405
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:42,800
- You ready to go swimming?
- Hi!

1406
01:22:42,700 --> 01:22:44,300
We're breaking up.

1407
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:46,400
- What?
- Yeah. Gil's moving to Paris.

1408
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:48,300
- I knew it. I told you.
- What's going on?

1409
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:51,000
No, no, I'm going to stay in Paris, but

1410
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:52,400
just because we're...

1411
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:55,200
If I'm unhappy, I'll move back.
But for the time being, yes.

1412
01:22:55,100 --> 01:22:57,700
W...W...With who?...
With who, Gil?

1413
01:22:57,500 --> 01:23:00,300
- No one, I...
- One of your crazy hallucinatory friends?

1414
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:02,200
I mean, Mom's right about you.

1415
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:04,000
You have this part missing.

1416
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,400
Yeah, I said that first.

1417
01:23:05,300 --> 01:23:07,600
Anyone whose protagonist
makes a living

1418
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:10,900
selling old cap pistols
and Joan Crawford cutout books...

1419
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:13,500
- Honestly...
- Look, I'm not trying to be

1420
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:16,100
a martyr, but I think
you'll be better off without me.

1421
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,700
- I really do.
- But we would!

1422
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:21,700
- I can't believe you're moving.
- Go ahead. Go ahead!

1423
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:26,800
Walk the streets. Gush over the
Parisian light and the rooftops.

1424
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:28,600
Goodbye, Inez.

1425
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:31,500
- Say hi to Trotsky.
- Yeah.

1426
01:23:32,700 --> 01:23:36,200
- Unbelievable!
- You know, I had...

1427
01:23:36,100 --> 01:23:40,000
a private detective follow him.
I knew he was up to no good.

1428
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:42,000
- You did?
- You bet I did.

1429
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
He saw him get into a car
at midnight every night,

1430
01:23:43,900 --> 01:23:45,900
and he followed him very closely.

1431
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:49,100
- And what happened?
- I don't know.

1432
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:53,100
The detective agency says
the detective is missing.

1433
01:23:53,900 --> 01:23:55,100
<i>Ã qui dois-je l'honneur?
(To whom do I owe the honor?)</i>

1434
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:57,600
<i>Je...Je suis perdu.
(I...I'm lost.)</i>

1435
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:59,500
<i>J'ai detournÃ©e la mauvaise endroit.
(I made a wrong turn.)</i>

1436
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:02,600
<i>Gardes! Gardes!
(Guards! Guards!)</i>

1437
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:04,500
<i>Lui coupe la tÃªte!
(Off with his head!)</i>

1438
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:06,400
<i>Lui coupe la tÃªte!
(Off with his head!)</i>

1439
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:13,500
- Hey! Hi!
- Hey!

1440
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:16,900
Wow! What...

1441
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:20,000
Good to see you.

1442
01:25:19,900 --> 01:25:21,900
What are you doing here?

1443
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:24,000
I'm returning from dinner with friends.

1444
01:25:23,900 --> 01:25:25,900
- Oh. OK.
- I live here.

1445
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:28,900
And you? What are you doing here?

1446
01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:31,200
I was just out for a walk.

1447
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:34,300
Yeah, I'm actually...I decided.
I'm moving to Paris.

1448
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:37,800
- Really? Wow. I'm sure you will love it.
- Yeah.

1449
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:40,500
- Yeah. You think so?
- Yeah.

1450
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:42,800
You know, I thought about
you the other day.

1451
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:44,500
- Really?
- Yeah, because

1452
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:48,100
my boss got a whole
new album of Cole Porter songs.

1453
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,300
That made you think about me?

1454
01:25:50,300 --> 01:25:53,200
I like to be thought of that way.

1455
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:57,300
You're on your way home right now?

1456
01:25:57,700 --> 01:25:59,100
Yes.

1457
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:03,300
Can I walk with you,
or, I'll buy you a cup of coffee?

1458
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:06,100
Oh, OK, now it's starting to rain.

1459
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:10,900
No, but that's OK.
I don't mind getting wet.

1460
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:13,800
- Really?
- Yeah.

1461
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:18,300
Actually, Paris is the most beautiful in the rain.

1462
01:26:18,100 --> 01:26:20,400
I feel that's what
I'm always saying.

1463
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:22,900
I couldn't agree more with you.

1464
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:26,100
Yes, it is more beautiful.

1465
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,800
By the way, my name is Gabrielle.

1466
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:30,900
- Gil.
- Nice to meet you.

1467
01:26:30,900 --> 01:26:34,000
That's a pretty name.
