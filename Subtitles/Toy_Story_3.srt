4
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,584
Money, money.

5
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:19,769
You have a date with justice.
- Sorry, Sheriff ...

6
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,053
I am married.

7
00:01:23,181 --> 00:01:25,297
And eye-pirate?

8
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:42,193
You dropped something.

9
00:01:42,194 --> 00:01:45,598
Give it up, your end is near.

10
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:48,787
I always wanted to
end with a bang.

11
00:01:57,962 --> 00:02:00,132
No!
- The orphans!

12
00:02:00,964 --> 00:02:04,376
I do not want to leave early,
but our ride is here.

13
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:12,264
It's me or the children. Choose.

14
00:02:15,341 --> 00:02:18,227
Ride like the wind.

15
00:02:23,089 --> 00:02:25,719
Keep quiet.

16
00:02:29,982 --> 00:02:32,617
Woody, hurry up.

17
00:02:52,241 --> 00:02:54,552
No ...

18
00:03:02,371 --> 00:03:07,403
But I can catch the train.
- Now some catching criminals.

19
00:03:07,404 --> 00:03:10,416
Infinity and beyond.

20
00:03:25,757 --> 00:03:29,528
Reach for the sky.
- You can not make me.

21
00:03:29,529 --> 00:03:33,118
I brought my attack dog
with a force field.

22
00:03:40,477 --> 00:03:44,797
And I eat my dinosaur
that force fields.

23
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:06,298
Malicious Pig.

24
00:04:08,027 --> 00:04:11,305
That evil Doctor Mr Pig.

25
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:56,287
Buzz, shoot your laser on my badge.
- No, I will kill you.

26
00:04:56,288 --> 00:04:58,639
Just do it.

27
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:04,428
You go to jail. Watch out.

28
00:05:06,485 --> 00:05:10,163
Mom!
- Do go if I am not there.

29
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:13,054
No, Molly ...
- It's okay.

30
00:05:13,055 --> 00:05:15,774
A baby of 1.5 meters from space.

31
00:05:15,874 --> 00:05:19,410
And she tramples everything.
Run for your lives!

32
00:05:20,474 --> 00:05:23,135
The red light means
that it works?

33
00:05:23,136 --> 00:05:25,820
Say happy birthday to Molly.

34
00:05:26,637 --> 00:05:29,558
Happy birthday.
- Charming.

35
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:34,194
Look how big you are.

36
00:05:47,128 --> 00:05:49,725
Buzz Light year to rescue.

37
00:05:51,062 --> 00:05:52,977
Good job.

38
00:06:17,546 --> 00:06:22,914
Everyone in position.
- I think my other eye.

39
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:25,759
Whose foot is in my face
- my, give back.

40
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,383
You saved our lives.
We are eternally grateful.

41
00:06:28,676 --> 00:06:30,789
Buzz, do you mind if I
sit down next to you?

42
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:35,383
Yes, no, why should I care?

43
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:38,815
It's hot here.
- Here they come.

44
00:06:41,824 --> 00:06:44,500
Sergeant, did you?
- Mission completed.

45
00:06:46,995 --> 00:06:49,280
Careful.

46
00:06:51,512 --> 00:06:53,687
Guys, we have a chance.

47
00:06:53,688 --> 00:06:56,351
Everybody ready?
- Ready. Ahead with it.

48
00:06:56,352 --> 00:06:59,680
Buzz, make the call.

49
00:07:11,034 --> 00:07:16,302
Target's move.
Just as we practiced.

50
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,720
Hello, is anyone there?

51
00:07:36,721 --> 00:07:40,885
Molly, stay out of my room.
- I am not there.

52
00:07:40,886 --> 00:07:45,704
Anyone who has sat on my stuff
- I do not.

53
00:07:51,358 --> 00:07:56,783
That went well.
- He held me really down.

54
00:07:56,784 --> 00:08:01,016
This is bad.
- He is 17 years.

55
00:08:01,017 --> 00:08:03,694
There is no longer
with us played.

56
00:08:05,841 --> 00:08:11,534
Guys, we do a meeting.

57
00:08:11,535 --> 00:08:14,803
Not again.
- Get everyone together.

58
00:08:14,804 --> 00:08:17,923
We're together, Woody.

59
00:08:17,924 --> 00:08:23,905
We all knew that surgery
was a gamble Runtime.

60
00:08:23,906 --> 00:08:28,761
More a failure.
- It is not about
to be played ...

61
00:08:28,762 --> 00:08:31,391
But to be there for Andy.
We know that.

62
00:08:31,392 --> 00:08:33,756
We can try again, right?

63
00:08:34,623 --> 00:08:37,633
I termination, boys. We stop it.

64
00:08:37,634 --> 00:08:40,771
Andy goes to college soon.

65
00:08:40,772 --> 00:08:42,975
This was our last chance.

66
00:08:42,976 --> 00:08:46,528
We go to the attic.
Keep your tools close.

67
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:49,837
Spare parts, batteries ...
everything for a little
transition period.

68
00:08:49,937 --> 00:08:53,610
Transition? We have been there.

69
00:08:53,611 --> 00:08:56,463
We knew this day was
coming there.

70
00:08:56,464 --> 00:09:01,443
Yes, but now he is.
- Any toy that goes.

71
00:09:01,444 --> 00:09:04,027
What are you doing?
- The war is over.

72
00:09:04,028 --> 00:09:07,135
We will fight elsewhere.
- Elsewhere?

73
00:09:07,136 --> 00:09:09,452
Absent without leave
- we have our duty.

74
00:09:09,453 --> 00:09:11,719
Andy is grown.
And come and face ...

75
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,066
and trash bags upstairs,
we are first in.

76
00:09:15,067 --> 00:09:17,631
Dirt Bags
- Who said anything about that?

77
00:09:17,632 --> 00:09:21,657
It was an honor to fight with you.
Good luck.

78
00:09:23,054 --> 00:09:26,484
That will you need.
- No, wait.

79
00:09:26,485 --> 00:09:29,512
Are we disposed of
- No, no.

80
00:09:29,513 --> 00:09:31,732
How do you know
- we are left behind.

81
00:09:31,733 --> 00:09:33,844
It's good, Jessie.
- Why do they then departed.

82
00:09:33,845 --> 00:09:36,419
Should we leave
- we went not to the attic?

83
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:40,311
I hate this uncertainty.
- Wait. Just silence.

84
00:09:40,312 --> 00:09:42,697
No one is thrown away.

85
00:09:42,698 --> 00:09:47,765
We're all still here.
We lost a couple indeed ...

86
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:51,351
Wheezy and Etch.
- Bo Peep.

87
00:09:53,107 --> 00:09:56,237
Yes, even Bo.

88
00:09:56,238 --> 00:09:59,057
All good toys for new owners.

89
00:09:59,058 --> 00:10:01,727
But at every garage sale
each spring cleaning ...

90
00:10:01,728 --> 00:10:03,651
Andy loved us.

91
00:10:03,652 --> 00:10:06,887
He must care about us
if we were not here.

92
00:10:06,888 --> 00:10:11,419
Andy brings us nice snug
and safe in the attic.

93
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,863
And we are all together.
- Exactly.

94
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:16,551
There are games and books there.
- Racetrack circuit.

95
00:10:16,552 --> 00:10:19,723
Thank you.
- And the old TV.

96
00:10:19,724 --> 00:10:25,129
Voila, the old TV.
And those guys from
the Christmas tree.

97
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:26,700
These are also great, right?

98
00:10:27,517 --> 00:10:31,699
On one day, with luck, Andy
himself has children.

99
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,551
And then he plays
with us, right?

100
00:10:34,358 --> 00:10:37,514
We will always be there for him.
- Come ...

101
00:10:37,515 --> 00:10:41,324
Let our parts and take
a trip to go.

102
00:10:41,325 --> 00:10:45,341
I do my best for another.
- Where did you this time?

103
00:10:45,342 --> 00:10:49,166
A dark and dusty.

104
00:10:49,167 --> 00:10:52,151
Let's see what price
we get on eBay.

105
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:55,923
Andy makes sure for us.

106
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:24,720
It assures them, h
- I do not know, Buzz.

107
00:11:24,721 --> 00:11:28,056
What else can I say?

108
00:11:28,057 --> 00:11:31,314
We are all means
always together.

109
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:33,750
To infinity and beyond.

110
00:11:34,566 --> 00:11:36,445
I get your stereo?
- No.

111
00:11:43,955 --> 00:11:45,852
I get your computer
- No.

112
00:11:45,853 --> 00:11:48,158
Your video games
- forget it, Molly.

113
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:51,618
Andy, let us begin.
Everything you do not bring ...

114
00:11:51,619 --> 00:11:53,835
or go to the attic,
or in the trash.

115
00:11:53,836 --> 00:11:56,892
I leave Friday only.
- It afvaldag.

116
00:11:57,514 --> 00:12:00,709
It's simple.
Skateboard: College.

117
00:12:00,793 --> 00:12:02,922
Little League trophy.
Maybe attic.

118
00:12:02,923 --> 00:12:04,998
Clocks House: Waste.

119
00:12:04,999 --> 00:12:08,394
The rest is up to you.
- Why did you have?

120
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:12,977
Molly, my room.
- Still three days
and it's mine.

121
00:12:12,978 --> 00:12:16,856
You'll also still work.
You have more toys
than you can play.

122
00:12:16,857 --> 00:12:18,892
They can make other
children happy.

123
00:12:18,893 --> 00:12:21,465
Which children
- one from the crche.

124
00:12:21,466 --> 00:12:24,108
They always ask for donations.
- What is that?

125
00:12:24,568 --> 00:12:28,484
No buts, choose what you want
to donate and I put them off.

126
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:42,704
Ocharme, Barbie.
- I get a corvette.

127
00:12:42,705 --> 00:12:45,608
Andy, make decisions.

128
00:12:45,609 --> 00:12:48,383
Like
- what you going to do this.

129
00:12:48,384 --> 00:12:52,079
Donate to Sunnyside?
Maybe sell online?

130
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,324
Mom, nobody would want them.

131
00:12:54,325 --> 00:12:57,903
They are waste.
- You have until Friday.

132
00:12:57,904 --> 00:13:00,648
Everything is not wrapped,
or attic ...

133
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:03,996
is thrown away.
- Whatever.

134
00:13:55,575 --> 00:13:59,042
What happens
- we dispose idiot.

135
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,632
Need some help
- I got it.

136
00:14:15,633 --> 00:14:18,853
Will you miss me when I'm gone?

137
00:14:18,854 --> 00:14:21,172
If I say no, will I still
have your room?

138
00:14:21,173 --> 00:14:23,668
No.
- Yes, then.

139
00:14:23,669 --> 00:14:26,402
I can not breathe.
- This is not true.

140
00:14:26,403 --> 00:14:28,571
Still, what's that sound?

141
00:14:38,331 --> 00:14:40,576
Andy.

142
00:14:42,454 --> 00:14:44,883
That is not a waste.

143
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,054
Remember, Woody.

144
00:14:47,815 --> 00:14:49,962
Buster, come here.

145
00:14:56,498 --> 00:14:58,955
Boy, the steps.

146
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:05,396
No, Buster. No.

147
00:15:06,502 --> 00:15:08,514
Stand up.

148
00:15:24,155 --> 00:15:26,607
We stand on the sidewalk.
- I knew it.

149
00:15:26,707 --> 00:15:29,058
Everybody pulling.

150
00:15:38,468 --> 00:15:41,716
It will not slip.

151
00:15:41,717 --> 00:15:43,377
It is of polyethylene.

152
00:15:43,378 --> 00:15:46,511
There must be a way out.
- Andy is not. What's the point?

153
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:49,364
Point, point!

154
00:15:51,182 --> 00:15:54,876
Push!
- I hear the dustcart.

155
00:15:55,505 --> 00:15:58,296
It comes closer.

156
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:37,685
Buzz. Jessie.

157
00:16:45,265 --> 00:16:49,178
Andy threw us away.
- He called our waste.

158
00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:51,439
How could he?

159
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,247
It succeeds at nothing.
- This we should know.

160
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:58,110
It's just like Emily.
- The sergeant was right.

161
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:01,966
Woody and wrong.
- Wait. Not hysterical.

162
00:17:01,967 --> 00:17:05,346
Since it is the perfect time.
- Be hysterical.

163
00:17:05,347 --> 00:17:07,631
Maybe, but not now.

164
00:17:09,032 --> 00:17:12,090
I know what to do.

165
00:17:18,526 --> 00:17:20,825
What?

166
00:17:20,826 --> 00:17:24,417
This we have done years ago.
- What about Woody?

167
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:27,265
He's okay, Buzz. Andy takes him.

168
00:17:27,266 --> 00:17:29,706
We gotta go.

169
00:17:30,305 --> 00:17:32,700
You're right. Forward.

170
00:17:32,701 --> 00:17:37,736
Buzz, what's going on?
That box is given.

171
00:17:37,737 --> 00:17:41,065
Everything under control. We have a plan.
- We go to the crche.

172
00:17:41,066 --> 00:17:43,734
Are you crazy?

173
00:17:43,735 --> 00:17:49,167
Andy was our disposal.
- No, he wanted you
in the attic.

174
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:51,998
How did we put on the sidewalk
- a mistake.

175
00:17:51,999 --> 00:17:56,194
Andy's Mom found your waste.
- Andy put us in a garbage bag.

176
00:17:56,195 --> 00:18:00,933
And called our waste.
- You gotta believe me.

177
00:18:00,934 --> 00:18:05,119
Of course, high school boy.
- Andy moves on, Woody.

178
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,583
We must do the same.

179
00:18:07,584 --> 00:18:10,273
From the box immediately.

180
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:13,926
Buzzy help me, this thing should be ...
- Woody, wait.

181
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:16,004
We must do what is
best for everyone.

182
00:18:22,055 --> 00:18:24,907
Great, it takes forever
to get back.

183
00:18:33,573 --> 00:18:36,565
It's okay, Barbie.
Gonna be okay.

184
00:18:37,841 --> 00:18:41,051
Molly and I were together
for years.

185
00:18:41,052 --> 00:18:45,859
I can not believe they throw me.

186
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,973
Welcome to the club.
- Listen ...

187
00:18:48,974 --> 00:18:51,267
we need to go back to Andy.

188
00:18:51,268 --> 00:18:54,693
We hide under the seat us ...
- Let it move you.

189
00:18:54,694 --> 00:18:58,790
He does not want us anymore.
- He put you in the attic!

190
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:02,095
He left us behind on the sidewalk.
- Both, calm.

191
00:19:02,096 --> 00:19:06,295
Wait until you see how the crche is.
- What is it?

192
00:19:06,296 --> 00:19:12,181
A sad, lonely place for
old toys with no owner.

193
00:19:14,825 --> 00:19:18,628
You may well comfort.
- You'll see when
we get there ...

194
00:19:18,629 --> 00:19:21,151
begging you to return.

195
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:38,829
Does anyone?
- There is a playground.

196
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:43,089
We have the prize.
- So far sad and lonely.

197
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:46,488
Keep this in perspective.
- Perspective?

198
00:19:46,489 --> 00:19:49,009
This place is perfect.
- It is very beautiful.

199
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:51,704
There is a rainbow at the door.

200
00:19:55,431 --> 00:19:59,002
Hi, there.
- That's a long time ago.

201
00:19:59,003 --> 00:20:03,071
I wanted toys this issue.
Is that Bonnie?

202
00:20:03,072 --> 00:20:06,451
Look how big you already are.
- Say hello, baby.

203
00:20:06,452 --> 00:20:08,698
Hello.
- How are your children?

204
00:20:09,688 --> 00:20:13,308
These are not kids anymore.
Andy goes to college.

205
00:20:13,309 --> 00:20:16,076
Can you believe it
- they do not miss them?

206
00:20:16,077 --> 00:20:18,298
No, it is never played.

207
00:20:20,446 --> 00:20:23,627
Do you see any children?
- Where are they us?

208
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:32,947
Look.
- What?

209
00:20:42,915 --> 00:20:45,566
I see nothing.

210
00:20:45,567 --> 00:20:48,662
Outside playtime.

211
00:20:52,857 --> 00:20:55,321
What do we do now?
- Back to Andy.

212
00:20:55,322 --> 00:20:57,331
Does anyone out
- who want an exit.

213
00:20:57,332 --> 00:21:00,996
Let them play with us.
- The other toys can be jealous.

214
00:21:00,997 --> 00:21:03,977
I want to see. It's my turn.

215
00:21:08,975 --> 00:21:11,591
New toys!

216
00:21:17,132 --> 00:21:20,743
Hi, nice.
- Buzz Light year
to your service.

217
00:21:24,597 --> 00:21:28,892
Thank you. May I?

218
00:21:31,678 --> 00:21:35,017
The gripper.

219
00:21:40,379 --> 00:21:43,116
Hi, there.

220
00:21:43,117 --> 00:21:47,490
I thought all new voices.
Welcome to Sunnyside.

221
00:21:47,491 --> 00:21:51,935
I Lotso the bear, but
call me Lotso.

222
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:54,188
Buzz Light year, we come in ...

223
00:21:54,843 --> 00:21:59,063
What you should know about me
is that I am a knuffelaar.

224
00:21:59,064 --> 00:22:01,972
You seem to have been
through a lot.

225
00:22:01,973 --> 00:22:05,085
Horrible.
- Now you are safe.

226
00:22:05,086 --> 00:22:08,844
We are all cast-offs.
Dumped, given ...

227
00:22:08,845 --> 00:22:12,513
garage sales and second hand.

228
00:22:12,514 --> 00:22:17,553
You will discover that this is the
best thing you could happen.

229
00:22:17,554 --> 00:22:22,065
Mr. Lotso, they play here
every day with toys?

230
00:22:22,066 --> 00:22:24,489
All day. Five days a week.

231
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:28,279
What if the children grow up
- I'll tell you.

232
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,396
When they get old, there
will be new to.

233
00:22:31,397 --> 00:22:34,406
If they are old, replace
them new.

234
00:22:34,407 --> 00:22:38,519
You never outgrow them,
or never left ...

235
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:42,866
or forgotten.
No owners, no means
broken heart.

236
00:22:44,107 --> 00:22:47,737
A miracle.
- And you wanted to keep Andy.

237
00:22:47,738 --> 00:22:52,112
Because we are his toys.
- You were given by him, h?

238
00:22:52,113 --> 00:22:55,504
It's his loss. He can not hurt.

239
00:22:55,945 --> 00:23:00,730
Let your place.
... Ken where is that boy. Ken!

240
00:23:00,731 --> 00:23:04,859
New toys.
- So there.

241
00:23:09,402 --> 00:23:11,791
Who is ready for Ken's
dream tour?

242
00:23:11,886 --> 00:23:16,697
Show them where they reside.
- If you want to go here ...

243
00:23:26,611 --> 00:23:28,634
I'm Ken.
- Barbie.

244
00:23:28,635 --> 00:23:32,752
Have we met?
- I would not know.

245
00:23:32,753 --> 00:23:36,435
I love your legwarmers.
- Beautiful Ascot.

246
00:23:36,436 --> 00:23:41,053
Come on, Ken. Break does not last forever.
- This way, everyone.

247
00:23:41,848 --> 00:23:46,741
You have a good prospect.
They love new toys.

248
00:23:46,742 --> 00:23:50,547
What a nice bear.
- It smells like strawberries.

249
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:56,508
Here we have all but
demands toys.

250
00:23:56,509 --> 00:24:02,109
Spare parts, super glue,
and a lot of batteries.

251
00:24:02,773 --> 00:24:06,206
If you think getting
old, stop worrying.

252
00:24:06,207 --> 00:24:09,897
Our Beer SPA keep brand new.

253
00:24:11,775 --> 00:24:15,237
I live here.
Ken his dream house.

254
00:24:15,238 --> 00:24:20,375
With a disco, a Dune Buggy.
And a room for clothes to fit.

255
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:26,348
You have everything.
- Everything except
someone to share.

256
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:31,310
If you need anything, ask me.

257
00:24:31,311 --> 00:24:33,246
We are al

258
00:24:35,685 --> 00:24:40,180
Thank you, Big Baby.
Meet our new friends.

259
00:24:40,903 --> 00:24:44,484
Poor baby, we are
thrown together.

260
00:24:44,485 --> 00:24:50,097
Abandoned by the same owner.
But here are not necessary ...

261
00:24:50,098 --> 00:24:53,336
we live in ourselves.
Our own masters.

262
00:24:53,337 --> 00:24:55,960
Our own destiny.

263
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:58,310
Watch out for Puddles.

264
00:24:58,311 --> 00:25:01,010
You stay here.

265
00:25:01,011 --> 00:25:03,652
The Caterpillar Room.

266
00:25:04,464 --> 00:25:06,173
Watch this space again.

267
00:25:08,353 --> 00:25:10,486
The prize.

268
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:13,014
Hello.
- Hello.

269
00:25:14,461 --> 00:25:17,141
It is so beautiful.

270
00:25:18,974 --> 00:25:20,661
What?

271
00:25:20,662 --> 00:25:22,163
H, baby.

272
00:25:22,164 --> 00:25:24,692
How long ago was it that was
played there with you?

273
00:25:24,693 --> 00:25:28,176
Years ago.
- Wait ...

274
00:25:28,177 --> 00:25:33,006
a few minutes, that bubble,
and are you dreams.

275
00:25:33,007 --> 00:25:35,840
Really play. I can not wait.

276
00:25:35,841 --> 00:25:38,898
If you would excuse us,
we go back best.

277
00:25:38,899 --> 00:25:43,522
Welcome to Sunnyside.
- Thank you. Bye.

278
00:25:43,523 --> 00:25:46,601
I'll see again
- I see you tonight.

279
00:25:46,602 --> 00:25:51,202
In my dreams.
- Ken, a quick bit.

280
00:25:51,203 --> 00:25:54,430
Barbie, come with me
to my dream home.

281
00:25:54,431 --> 00:25:57,446
I know we only know each other.
You do not know me
from GI Joe ...

282
00:25:57,447 --> 00:26:01,496
but when I look at you ... it seems
- if we made for each other?

283
00:26:03,297 --> 00:26:06,774
Yes
- I'm coming, Lotso.

284
00:26:08,642 --> 00:26:11,141
I'm so excited.

285
00:26:17,006 --> 00:26:19,992
That seems to me children.
- I want to be played ...

286
00:26:19,993 --> 00:26:25,636
Why does time slow.
- How many are there?

287
00:26:32,028 --> 00:26:35,404
I admit that this is fun.

288
00:26:35,717 --> 00:26:40,106
But we must go home.
- Here we have a new life.

289
00:26:40,107 --> 00:26:44,339
A chance to return children happy.
- Why do not you?

290
00:26:44,439 --> 00:26:46,748
Yes, stay.
- Come on.

291
00:26:46,749 --> 00:26:50,478
It is played.
- No, guys. No.

292
00:26:51,324 --> 00:26:55,060
We all have a child. Andy.

293
00:26:55,061 --> 00:26:58,660
And if he wants us at the high
school, or in the attic ...

294
00:26:58,661 --> 00:27:01,344
we should be there for him.

295
00:27:01,345 --> 00:27:05,316
I'm going home.
Everyone should accompany me.

296
00:27:05,317 --> 00:27:07,602
Come on, Buzz.

297
00:27:15,421 --> 00:27:18,154
Our mission is completed
with Andy.

298
00:27:18,155 --> 00:27:21,574
What?
- We must stay together.

299
00:27:21,575 --> 00:27:24,422
Without Andy, we were
not together.

300
00:27:24,423 --> 00:27:28,589
Look at your shoe, you too Jessie,
what name is on it?

301
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:35,519
Perhaps Andy does not care about us.
- Of course. To us all.

302
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,336
I saw that he wanted to put you in the attic.
Times now not turn
your back on him.

303
00:27:39,337 --> 00:27:41,810
Wake up. It's over.

304
00:27:41,811 --> 00:27:45,299
Andy is grown.

305
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:51,574
Well, that's perfect.
How selfish of you.

306
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:03,207
So this is it end?
After everything we've
been through?

307
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:21,987
No, Bullseye, you must continue.

308
00:28:25,482 --> 00:28:27,747
No, I said stay.

309
00:28:30,339 --> 00:28:33,761
I do not want you just
sitting in the attic.

310
00:28:33,762 --> 00:28:36,493
Stay.

311
00:28:39,144 --> 00:28:42,251
Bonnie.

312
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,135
I gotta go.

313
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:50,948
Bonnie, are you here?

314
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:13,436
Come on ... No, no.

315
00:29:52,436 --> 00:29:54,877
What is that?

316
00:29:56,913 --> 00:29:59,517
That's better.

317
00:29:59,518 --> 00:30:03,185
Bonnie! There you are.

318
00:30:03,186 --> 00:30:05,806
Come on, time to go home.

319
00:30:29,281 --> 00:30:30,897
No, no ...

320
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:15,107
Reach for the sky.

321
00:31:16,095 --> 00:31:19,384
Inne, love, moe ...

322
00:31:24,926 --> 00:31:28,247
You're my favorite deputy.

323
00:31:28,248 --> 00:31:31,064
Bonnie!
- I'm coming.

324
00:31:34,178 --> 00:31:35,932
Great.

325
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:51,122
Everything will be fine.
- Woody goes along with Andy.

326
00:31:51,123 --> 00:31:53,290
As he always wanted.
- He's crazy.

327
00:31:53,291 --> 00:31:56,340
College is no place for toys.
- These serve as gaming.

328
00:31:56,341 --> 00:31:59,531
Buzz talking about gaming.
They are insisting.

329
00:31:59,631 --> 00:32:01,330
How much?
- A lot.

330
00:32:01,331 --> 00:32:04,342
I can hardly wait.
- In position.

331
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,508
I am a first time played.

332
00:32:21,841 --> 00:32:24,593
... Rex
- Come to daddy.

333
00:33:17,939 --> 00:33:20,973
There's a snake in my boot.

334
00:33:20,974 --> 00:33:25,321
I would like to your party, but
first I am singing a song.

335
00:33:25,322 --> 00:33:27,311
A sheriff!

336
00:33:28,568 --> 00:33:31,995
On the side, Mr..
Pricklepants. We have a guest.

337
00:33:31,996 --> 00:33:34,015
Would you like coffee?

338
00:33:34,016 --> 00:33:38,316
It is good for you, but not
too much, otherwise you ...

339
00:33:38,317 --> 00:33:41,024
Do you ... I'll be back.

340
00:33:41,958 --> 00:33:44,595
Hello, excuse me.

341
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:48,489
Where am I?
- He asks only slightly.

342
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:51,976
Excuse me, I want to
stay in my role.

343
00:33:52,704 --> 00:33:56,207
My name is Buttercup.
Baron von Sush know you al

344
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:58,906
Hi, I'm Trixie.

345
00:33:58,907 --> 00:34:03,332
I do not know where I am.
- Or a café in Paris ...

346
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:06,587
or a tavern in New Jersey.
I just come from the doctor ...

347
00:34:06,588 --> 00:34:11,133
with life-changing news.
- Just have fun ...

348
00:34:11,134 --> 00:34:13,032
I will take.
- No, no ...

349
00:34:13,033 --> 00:34:15,021
Who wants to Sludge?

350
00:34:17,236 --> 00:34:20,390
A secret ingredients.
Jelly Beans.

351
00:34:21,382 --> 00:34:25,242
Someone has poisoned the water hole.
- Poisoned?

352
00:34:25,243 --> 00:34:28,258
Who does anything in common?

353
00:34:32,172 --> 00:34:34,544
The terrifying witch. Watch out.

354
00:34:34,545 --> 00:34:37,185
She used her witch powers.

355
00:34:37,186 --> 00:34:39,896
I know a shelter.

356
00:34:41,905 --> 00:34:45,359
They never find us here.

357
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,763
What is wrong?

358
00:34:48,135 --> 00:34:51,685
They found us.
We must have a spaceship,
to escape from the witch.

359
00:34:51,686 --> 00:34:54,486
You're doing great.
- Are you classically trained?

360
00:34:54,487 --> 00:34:58,756
How do I get out of here
- there is no way out.

361
00:34:58,757 --> 00:35:03,145
Joke, the door is over there.
- You jumped right in there.

362
00:35:03,146 --> 00:35:05,127
I'm Dolly.
- Woody.

363
00:35:05,128 --> 00:35:08,837
Are you serious?
You can change him,
and so new room.

364
00:35:08,838 --> 00:35:11,508
And that says a doll
named Dolly.

365
00:35:12,421 --> 00:35:15,099
Who's new?
- Are you a real cowboy?

366
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,177
Actually ...
- Of course not.

367
00:35:17,178 --> 00:35:19,693
He even has a hat.
- That I have ...

368
00:35:19,694 --> 00:35:21,312
My hat.
- There you go.

369
00:35:21,313 --> 00:35:24,013
I found a spaceship.
- Showtime.

370
00:35:24,014 --> 00:35:28,068
Fast, inside. Straps, sheets up.

371
00:35:28,069 --> 00:35:30,860
Hang on, it can be bumpy.

372
00:35:30,861 --> 00:35:34,214
Three, two, n, up.

373
00:35:38,167 --> 00:35:41,490
You saved us, you're our hero.

374
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:53,435
I have pain in my side.

375
00:35:55,472 --> 00:35:57,912
Where's my tail?

376
00:36:03,768 --> 00:36:06,431
Someone need a hand?

377
00:36:06,742 --> 00:36:08,161
Where's my nose?
- Here.

378
00:36:08,162 --> 00:36:10,430
Here's your arm.
Where's my mustache?

379
00:36:10,431 --> 00:36:13,547
I remember not playing.

380
00:36:14,116 --> 00:36:18,739
Andy z never played with us.
- We make the most of it.

381
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:21,980
Toddlers who do not know how to play.
- They are too young.

382
00:36:21,981 --> 00:36:24,918
And they're sticky.
- We have been in the
Butterfly House.

383
00:36:24,919 --> 00:36:27,270
With the big kids.
- That is correct.

384
00:36:27,271 --> 00:36:31,177
I'm going to talk to
Lotso us to move.

385
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,412
Damn, try that.

386
00:36:37,982 --> 00:36:40,105
Closed.
- Here, too.

387
00:36:40,106 --> 00:36:41,967
Try the windows.
- Negative.

388
00:36:41,968 --> 00:36:45,967
It is a Snekler 380.
Dear child protection ever.

389
00:36:45,968 --> 00:36:49,659
We're trapped.
- Viel someone on the skylight?

390
00:36:50,713 --> 00:36:53,539
How do we get there?

391
00:36:54,531 --> 00:36:56,487
Everyone, I count to three.

392
00:36:56,488 --> 00:37:00,121
And ... two
- three!

393
00:37:02,064 --> 00:37:04,054
Release.

394
00:37:15,194 --> 00:37:16,929
Forward.

395
00:37:20,983 --> 00:37:22,900
He has succeeded.

396
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:26,616
Good job, Buzz.

397
00:37:28,273 --> 00:37:33,294
They had a nice gaming
- Silent, They'll hear you.

398
00:37:34,806 --> 00:37:36,655
You start.
- I ...

399
00:37:36,656 --> 00:37:38,464
Keep ...
- From you.

400
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:41,116
Now I want to finish it all.
First.

401
00:37:41,117 --> 00:37:42,574
I ...
- Hou ...

402
00:37:42,575 --> 00:37:44,838
Yours.
- See, it always works.

403
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:48,651
You are so smart.
- Come on, Romeo.

404
00:37:48,652 --> 00:37:51,663
I'm going to miss you.

405
00:38:54,746 --> 00:38:57,097
Come on.

406
00:38:57,098 --> 00:38:59,054
There we go.
- Come on.

407
00:39:03,201 --> 00:39:04,317
No more money there.

408
00:39:04,318 --> 00:39:06,861
Point to here.
- On the duck.

409
00:39:07,475 --> 00:39:10,183
That's a duck.
- Won!

410
00:39:12,181 --> 00:39:14,585
The last round.
- You're lost.

411
00:39:14,586 --> 00:39:17,724
Minimum bid: 5 monopoly.
Wild coyote.

412
00:39:17,725 --> 00:39:19,760
Exchange of triple aces.

413
00:39:19,761 --> 00:39:21,759
What do you think of the
new 'here to stay?

414
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,460
Please.
- Cowgirl?

415
00:39:24,461 --> 00:39:26,471
Dinosaur
- Small toddler.

416
00:39:26,472 --> 00:39:29,150
But that space guy.
It can be useful.

417
00:39:29,151 --> 00:39:33,306
He is not the sharpest knife in the
place where they keep the knives.

418
00:39:33,307 --> 00:39:35,112
Yes, you.

419
00:39:35,374 --> 00:39:37,798
You have one myself, right?

420
00:39:37,799 --> 00:39:39,524
Calm, Twitch.

421
00:39:39,525 --> 00:39:42,702
Barbie is different.
- Hear the weakling.

422
00:39:42,703 --> 00:39:47,011
What do you expect to show girls toy
- I'm not a girl toy!

423
00:39:47,111 --> 00:39:50,694
Why do you say?
- All that is disposable toys.

424
00:39:50,695 --> 00:39:53,762
We are lucky if they
survive one week.

425
00:39:57,628 --> 00:40:01,640
Look who's here.

426
00:40:02,709 --> 00:40:05,840
Let me go.
- Take him to the library.

427
00:40:05,841 --> 00:40:07,346
No!

428
00:40:36,802 --> 00:40:39,626
1225 Sycamore.

429
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:42,244
Woody, what are you doing?

430
00:40:42,245 --> 00:40:44,672
I gotta get outta here.
- Going?

431
00:40:44,673 --> 00:40:48,507
But you did not enjoy
- yes, more than in years.

432
00:40:48,508 --> 00:40:52,046
I belong to someone else.
- Who is Yitna?

433
00:40:52,047 --> 00:40:55,892
It is pronounced Yitn.
- It says Andy.

434
00:40:55,893 --> 00:40:58,437
He is my Bonnie.
And he leaves soon.

435
00:40:58,438 --> 00:41:00,524
I gotta get home.
- Where is that?

436
00:41:00,525 --> 00:41:02,708
Elm Street, 2304 Elm.

437
00:41:02,709 --> 00:41:05,968
Do you have a map?
- Doing. Trixie.

438
00:41:05,969 --> 00:41:08,470
I start the computer.

439
00:41:13,114 --> 00:41:16,697
Loosen, cowards.
Lotso I want to speak.

440
00:41:16,698 --> 00:41:21,226
Quiet, Buck Rogers.
You speak with Lotso
when we say ...

441
00:41:22,231 --> 00:41:27,221
Know what's going on?
Why is that toy-related?

442
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:30,702
He had escaped.
- Escaped?

443
00:41:30,703 --> 00:41:35,018
No, not if we treat our guests.

444
00:41:35,019 --> 00:41:40,232
I never do. See that. I am sorry

445
00:41:40,233 --> 00:41:42,506
Lotso, there is a mistake.
- A mistake?

446
00:41:42,507 --> 00:41:46,186
The kids in the Caterpillar
Room are too young for us.

447
00:41:46,187 --> 00:41:49,417
We respectfully request a transfer
to the Butterfly House.

448
00:41:49,418 --> 00:41:52,281
Request.
- But Lotso ...

449
00:41:52,282 --> 00:41:55,890
Silence. He shows initiative.

450
00:41:55,891 --> 00:41:59,394
Leadership. This is a keeper.

451
00:41:59,395 --> 00:42:02,650
Heard? A keeper.

452
00:42:05,321 --> 00:42:08,249
We bring you the bigger.

453
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:11,139
From now you get 
verything you want.

454
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:15,822
Perfect, I get my friends.
- Wait, Buzz.

455
00:42:15,823 --> 00:42:18,431
Caterpillars Children
who have little toy.

456
00:42:18,432 --> 00:42:21,823
My friends are not there.
- None of us.

457
00:42:21,824 --> 00:42:25,816
I do agree, therefore,
for our community ...

458
00:42:25,817 --> 00:42:32,449
let the new toys for the rough
work to do for the elderly.

459
00:42:34,583 --> 00:42:36,523
That seems to be correct.

460
00:42:36,524 --> 00:42:40,027
But I can not accept.
A family stays together.

461
00:42:40,723 --> 00:42:43,911
A family man, h. Why do not you?

462
00:42:43,912 --> 00:42:46,719
Back in the chair break.

463
00:42:47,775 --> 00:42:50,419
Let me go.

464
00:42:50,624 --> 00:42:53,067
Send Bookworm inside.

465
00:42:55,997 --> 00:43:01,089
That's it. Misplaced.

466
00:43:06,142 --> 00:43:09,893
Let's see.
Tools, Maintenance ...

467
00:43:10,843 --> 00:43:14,818
Remove the screws to the
battery to arrive.

468
00:43:14,819 --> 00:43:16,267
What are you doing?

469
00:43:17,246 --> 00:43:19,220
Let me go.

470
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:24,905
Your Buzz Light year action figure back
to his original creation to bring ...

471
00:43:24,906 --> 00:43:29,005
slide the button over
the 'Play' to 'Demo'.

472
00:43:29,006 --> 00:43:32,350
Stop! No, no.

473
00:43:32,478 --> 00:43:36,031
What was that?
- Sounds from the beginning
to take off.

474
00:43:36,032 --> 00:43:38,121
I will look.

475
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:44,346
See something?
- No, it's dark.

476
00:43:44,347 --> 00:43:47,702
Wait, I'm Andy.
- What?

477
00:43:47,703 --> 00:43:50,928
That is impossible.
- I really see him.

478
00:43:50,929 --> 00:43:53,728
In his room. My other eye!

479
00:43:53,729 --> 00:43:56,385
I've left behind.

480
00:43:58,249 --> 00:44:01,911
This is so strange. He grabs at.

481
00:44:01,912 --> 00:44:07,309
This is Buster. On the side.

482
00:44:08,144 --> 00:44:10,920
Andy is in the corridor.

483
00:44:10,921 --> 00:44:14,486
He looks in the attic.
There's Mommy.

484
00:44:15,172 --> 00:44:17,538
Why is he so angry?

485
00:44:17,539 --> 00:44:20,750
This is terrible.

486
00:44:21,568 --> 00:44:25,292
He searches and searches for us.

487
00:44:25,293 --> 00:44:29,061
He seeks us
- Andy wants us now.

488
00:44:29,062 --> 00:44:32,294
I just knew.
- He wished us well
in the attic.

489
00:44:32,295 --> 00:44:36,368
Woody would tell the truth.
- You did not believe him.

490
00:44:36,369 --> 00:44:40,814
You first.
- We need to go home.

491
00:44:42,887 --> 00:44:47,162
Lotso.
- How are you tonight?

492
00:44:47,163 --> 00:44:52,040
Thank God, you've seen Buzz
- We gotta go.

493
00:44:52,041 --> 00:44:54,633
Way? You have a pass.

494
00:44:54,634 --> 00:44:59,398
Recently we had no more volunteers
for the toddlers.

495
00:44:59,399 --> 00:45:02,594
They like so many new toys.

496
00:45:02,626 --> 00:45:05,445
Love?
There has been chewed on
us, kicked, gekwijld ...

497
00:45:05,446 --> 00:45:08,300
Just look at my pocket book.

498
00:45:08,335 --> 00:45:12,764
The thing is, sweet potato,
you do not leave Sunnyside.

499
00:45:12,765 --> 00:45:16,444
Sweet potato?
Who do you think you 't you?

500
00:45:16,445 --> 00:45:21,352
I have over 30 tools, and I
deserve more respect ...

501
00:45:21,963 --> 00:45:23,708
That's better.

502
00:45:23,709 --> 00:45:26,128
Nobody takes my wife's
mouth off, except me.

503
00:45:26,129 --> 00:45:28,294
Give back, hairy air freshener.

504
00:45:28,295 --> 00:45:33,350
We're going home, guys.
- You not going anywhere.

505
00:45:34,617 --> 00:45:37,029
Who is against us?

506
00:45:38,376 --> 00:45:41,404
Buzz, you're back. Buzz?

507
00:45:44,387 --> 00:45:46,441
Watch out.

508
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:54,366
Caught inoperative,
commander Lotso.

509
00:45:54,367 --> 00:45:56,996
What are you doing?
- Silence.

510
00:45:56,997 --> 00:46:00,909
You are captured by the Galactic Alliance.
- Galactic Alliance?

511
00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:04,822
Well done, Light year.
Lock them up.

512
00:46:04,823 --> 00:46:06,761
Yes, sir.

513
00:46:15,368 --> 00:46:17,864
Where are you going?

514
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:23,057
We are your friends.
- Spare me your lies.

515
00:46:23,058 --> 00:46:27,541
Your emperor is defeated and I am immune
to your charming good looks.

516
00:46:27,542 --> 00:46:30,235
Stay away from my wife.

517
00:46:30,236 --> 00:46:37,033
Let me go, slobbering idiot.
- He's not.
This potato ways to learn.

518
00:46:37,133 --> 00:46:40,505
Take him to the box.
- Put me down, you idiot.

519
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:43,146
Where are you taking me to?
Naughty baby.

520
00:46:43,147 --> 00:46:48,075
Ken, what's going on?
- Barbie.
You would be the dream
home waiting.

521
00:46:48,076 --> 00:46:51,432
What are you doing with my friends
- you go.

522
00:46:52,493 --> 00:46:54,659
Wait, Barbie.
- Do not touch me.

523
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:57,473
It's over.
- Barbie, I ...

524
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:01,724
Give back my scarf.

525
00:47:02,889 --> 00:47:07,618
Light year, explain where they sleep.
- Yes, sir.

526
00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:13,127
Prisoners sleep in their cells.
Anyone who plays his cell,
sleeping in the box.

527
00:47:13,128 --> 00:47:15,350
Appl between sunrise and sunset,

528
00:47:15,351 --> 00:47:19,282
If a prisoner appl misses
sleeps in the box.

529
00:47:19,283 --> 00:47:22,465
Prisoners say nothing, to
something they said.

530
00:47:22,466 --> 00:47:25,586
If a prisoner talk back ... he sleeps
- in the box.

531
00:47:25,587 --> 00:47:27,777
Understood.

532
00:47:27,778 --> 00:47:30,674
At ease, soldier.
They are neutralized.

533
00:47:30,709 --> 00:47:34,214
Remember, they will say anything,
so you start to doubt yourself.

534
00:47:34,215 --> 00:47:36,672
Do not worry, sir doubt
that I had ...

535
00:47:36,673 --> 00:47:39,382
is from the academy beaten me.

536
00:47:39,383 --> 00:47:43,729
We do things here
in Sunnyside so.

537
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:50,016
If you start bottom, pay your debts,
life can be great here.

538
00:47:50,051 --> 00:47:53,430
If you our complications
on the writing goes ...

539
00:47:53,431 --> 00:48:00,454
rather tries to leave, then
you hurt yourself.

540
00:48:00,706 --> 00:48:05,847
Woody, what have you done with him
- but you sleep good.

541
00:48:05,848 --> 00:48:10,197
Tomorrow you have a
whole day to play.

542
00:48:15,195 --> 00:48:19,155
1225 Syca ...

543
00:48:19,156 --> 00:48:22,389
Who is Velocistar237?

544
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:27,330
This is a toy dinosaur from the street.
That's nothing. I rule here.

545
00:48:27,365 --> 00:48:29,364
Only a dinosaur.

546
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:32,465
Sycamore. Enter.

547
00:48:32,877 --> 00:48:35,641
Please do not be far away.

548
00:48:36,481 --> 00:48:39,746
It's just around the corner.

549
00:48:42,505 --> 00:48:45,653
Look at me, I'm big toys.

550
00:48:45,654 --> 00:48:48,416
I see you on the Saka.

551
00:48:48,417 --> 00:48:51,681
If you ever get the crche
of Sunnyside ...

552
00:48:51,682 --> 00:48:54,647
say that Woody has come home.
- Did you in Sunnyside?

553
00:48:54,648 --> 00:48:58,575
How did you escape?
- That was not easy.

554
00:48:59,295 --> 00:49:01,835
What do you mean, escape?

555
00:49:01,836 --> 00:49:05,072
Sunnyside is a place of destruction
and despair.

556
00:49:05,073 --> 00:49:08,880
Managed by a bad bear, which
smells like strawberries.

557
00:49:09,686 --> 00:49:13,640
Lotso
- Fluffy and cuddly
on the outside ...

558
00:49:13,675 --> 00:49:18,076
inside he is a monster.
- How do you know?

559
00:49:18,841 --> 00:49:21,637
Chuckles will tell you.

560
00:49:27,118 --> 00:49:29,566
I've known Lotso.

561
00:49:30,397 --> 00:49:33,442
He was good toys. A friend.

562
00:49:33,443 --> 00:49:37,461
We had the same child. Daisy.

563
00:49:38,775 --> 00:49:42,322
I was there when Lotso
was extracted.

564
00:49:44,296 --> 00:49:49,862
Daisy loved us all.
But Lotso was special.

565
00:49:50,765 --> 00:49:54,200
They did everything together.

566
00:49:54,201 --> 00:49:57,710
I've never seen a child in love
and toys were on display.

567
00:49:58,474 --> 00:50:01,534
One day we went riding.

568
00:50:01,535 --> 00:50:04,954
On a stopover to play some.

569
00:50:05,748 --> 00:50:08,850
After lunch Daisy fell asleep.

570
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:20,329
She never came back.

571
00:50:23,853 --> 00:50:26,591
Lotso did not give up.

572
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:33,399
It took an eternity, but finally
we were at Daisy.

573
00:50:39,908 --> 00:50:43,221
But then it was too late.

574
00:50:54,219 --> 00:50:57,430
let's change that
day inside Lotso.

575
00:50:57,431 --> 00:51:01,001
Something snapped.
- They replaced us.

576
00:51:01,002 --> 00:51:03,568
Come on.
- She just replace you.

577
00:51:03,569 --> 00:51:06,816
No, all of us.

578
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:11,925
They do not love you.

579
00:51:11,926 --> 00:51:14,661
Come on.

580
00:51:18,779 --> 00:51:21,936
We were lost. Discarded.

581
00:51:21,937 --> 00:51:24,823
Unloved, not wanted.

582
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:32,898
Then we found Sunnyside.

583
00:51:42,036 --> 00:51:45,170
But Lotso was my friend anymore.

584
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,344
He was nobody's friend.

585
00:51:50,059 --> 00:51:54,167
He took on Sunnyside, and threw
it down whole system.

586
00:51:54,844 --> 00:51:58,026
How did you get it out?
- I was broke.

587
00:51:58,027 --> 00:52:03,342
Bonnie found me and took me home.
Other toys were not so lucky.

588
00:52:03,653 --> 00:52:09,999
It's not what Lotso done,
new toy has no chance.

589
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,652
My friends are there.
- You can not go back.

590
00:52:12,653 --> 00:52:16,973
Now go back is suicide.
- And You then Andy?

591
00:52:16,974 --> 00:52:20,382
He never went to school?

592
00:52:38,516 --> 00:52:40,610
Silence, music pig. Stop it.

593
00:52:43,345 --> 00:52:47,264
I miss Woody too.

594
00:52:49,303 --> 00:52:52,718
But he will never come back.

595
00:53:13,070 --> 00:53:16,834
All wake up.
- Commander, Lotso, sir.

596
00:53:17,619 --> 00:53:21,089
All quiet, nothing to report.
- Fine, Light year.

597
00:53:21,090 --> 00:53:26,031
We need you at 'command to space needed.
- What have you done
with my husband?

598
00:53:26,066 --> 00:53:28,918
Big Baby.

599
00:53:32,444 --> 00:53:35,826
Honey.

600
00:53:35,827 --> 00:53:40,042
It was cold and dark.
Nothing but sand and a couple
of "Lincoln Logs".

601
00:53:40,043 --> 00:53:42,415
I think those were not
"Lincoln Logs".

602
00:53:42,416 --> 00:53:46,513
Get it done.
There is a matchday
with destiny.

603
00:55:09,795 --> 00:55:13,271
You could not have come back, cowboy.
They are nice rage gone
since you left.

604
00:55:13,272 --> 00:55:18,050
More guards, more patrols.
You and your friends will
never get out here now.

605
00:55:18,051 --> 00:55:20,713
I am already once released.
- You're a lucky time.

606
00:55:20,714 --> 00:55:23,724
My advice? Keep your head down.

607
00:55:23,725 --> 00:55:26,194
You survive it.
- Yeah, how long?

608
00:55:26,195 --> 00:55:29,565
I've been here for years.
They never break me.

609
00:55:29,841 --> 00:55:32,787
These are toys but n way away.

610
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:36,885
Poor guy.
Morning, the garbage truck.

611
00:55:36,886 --> 00:55:41,761
Then go to the landfill.
- I appreciate your concern.

612
00:55:41,762 --> 00:55:44,709
A child is waiting for
us, so we go away.

613
00:55:44,982 --> 00:55:48,202
If you help us, one of the other
toys, I am very grateful to you.

614
00:55:51,371 --> 00:55:54,405
If you want out, you have got
to get through the doors.

615
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:57,687
Every night locked.
On the inside and outside.

616
00:55:57,688 --> 00:56:00,405
The keys hang from a hook in the office.
- Roger. What else?

617
00:56:00,406 --> 00:56:03,139
The car of Lotso driving
around all night.

618
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:06,308
The hall, the lobby, the playground ...
- And the wall?

619
00:56:06,309 --> 00:56:11,460
2.5 meters high.
Brick wall.
You can not get through.
You go over or lies underneath.

620
00:56:11,461 --> 00:56:14,068
It all seems so very bad.
- That it is not.

621
00:56:14,069 --> 00:56:17,073
Your real problem is the monkey.

622
00:56:17,108 --> 00:56:21,759
The monkey is the eye in the sky.
He sees everything.

623
00:56:22,615 --> 00:56:25,490
Classrooms ...

624
00:56:34,622 --> 00:56:36,672
corridors.

625
00:56:44,885 --> 00:56:47,701
Even the playground.

626
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:57,472
He can open doors, sneaking
past guards ...

627
00:56:57,473 --> 00:57:00,814
climbing over the wall, if you
do not shut that monkey ...

628
00:57:00,815 --> 00:57:03,525
you go nowhere.
Would you come here?

629
00:57:03,526 --> 00:57:06,665
Touch the monkey than lost.

630
00:57:06,666 --> 00:57:09,097
Pause. Come on, kids.

631
00:57:15,274 --> 00:57:18,355
Boys.
- Woody?

632
00:57:23,002 --> 00:57:25,592
You're still alive.
- Of course.

633
00:57:26,326 --> 00:57:29,814
My hat. Where's Buzz?

634
00:57:29,815 --> 00:57:33,895
Lotso has something to do with him.
- He thinks he 's a real
space ranger is.

635
00:57:33,896 --> 00:57:37,281
No.
- Yes, the return of
astronomical idiot.

636
00:57:37,282 --> 00:57:42,061
We had Andy not to leave.
I was wrong.

637
00:57:42,062 --> 00:57:44,287
Jessie is right. She was wrong.

638
00:57:44,288 --> 00:57:47,731
No, it's my fault that
I am with you gone.

639
00:57:47,732 --> 00:57:50,096
From now on, we stay together.

640
00:57:50,097 --> 00:57:52,257
But, Andy goes to school.

641
00:57:52,258 --> 00:57:57,063
School.
You must go home before
Andy leaves tomorrow.

642
00:57:57,098 --> 00:57:59,912
Tomorrow? That means ...
- that we break.

643
00:57:59,913 --> 00:58:02,345
Tonight.
- Impossible.

644
00:58:02,346 --> 00:58:05,273
You can not get out.
- That may be.

645
00:58:06,577 --> 00:58:09,195
But n away.

646
00:58:16,777 --> 00:58:19,329
Slinky Dog
- Present.

647
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:22,753
Green boys. Cowboy girl.

648
00:58:22,754 --> 00:58:25,371
Here.
- Horse?

649
00:58:26,228 --> 00:58:28,508
Piggy Bank.
- Yes.

650
00:58:28,509 --> 00:58:30,866
Tyranosaurus
- Here.

651
00:58:30,867 --> 00:58:32,976
Barbie
- Here.

652
00:58:32,977 --> 00:58:37,868
Potato Head?

653
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:41,708
Super Troopman, wake up.

654
00:58:41,709 --> 00:58:44,472
Impossible.

655
00:58:59,318 --> 00:59:01,945
Bit late for a walk,
Potato Head?

656
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:08,116
That's Mr. Potato Head to you.
- You have to show a mouth full.

657
00:59:13,304 --> 00:59:16,255
You Ascot bearing pink nose.
You're not a toy.

658
00:59:16,256 --> 00:59:18,729
You're a tool.
You're an inflated ball.

659
00:59:19,628 --> 00:59:22,979
Take him to the box.
- No, not the box.

660
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:26,027
I'm sorry, I did not mean it.
I love the Ascot.

661
00:59:28,416 --> 00:59:30,813
I'm going to look.
- Well done, Light year.

662
00:59:30,814 --> 00:59:33,620
Continue with your space thing.
- Thank you.

663
00:59:33,621 --> 00:59:36,151
Yes, sir, mature man.

664
00:59:36,186 --> 00:59:38,927
Ken?

665
00:59:41,554 --> 00:59:44,282
What do you want?
- I love it any more here.

666
00:59:44,283 --> 00:59:46,454
I want to go to the Butterfly House.
With you.

667
00:59:46,455 --> 00:59:49,931
There was yesterday to remember.
- I was wrong.

668
00:59:49,932 --> 00:59:52,761
I want with yours.
In your dream house.

669
00:59:52,762 --> 00:59:56,967
Please come get me here.

670
00:59:57,669 --> 01:00:02,009
Good.
But things are complicated.

671
01:00:02,044 --> 01:00:05,663
You must do what I say.
- I promise you.

672
01:00:06,502 --> 01:00:09,838
I'll do anything.
I Excuse your diapers.

673
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:59,020
Grab the tape.

674
01:01:05,282 --> 01:01:08,165
And here the magic happens.

675
01:01:08,905 --> 01:01:12,679
Take all your clothes again.
That me would never
have brought to it.

676
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:15,941
Tennis Apparel.
- Check this out.

677
01:01:15,942 --> 01:01:19,877
Kung Fu fighting, Canvas Hero
with a sports pennant.

678
01:01:19,878 --> 01:01:23,435
Flower Power.

679
01:01:24,002 --> 01:01:26,561
Nobody appreciates
garments here.

680
01:01:26,596 --> 01:01:32,698
Nobody.
- Do you want to show off
a few items of clothing?

681
01:01:32,699 --> 01:01:35,393
But a few.

682
01:02:07,351 --> 01:02:10,159
Where is the key.

683
01:02:10,286 --> 01:02:12,660
Gotcha.

684
01:02:21,512 --> 01:02:26,953
What do you do.
Stay away from my stuff.

685
01:02:26,954 --> 01:02:28,932
Come on, Porky.

686
01:02:30,003 --> 01:02:32,857
Not fighting. Stop.

687
01:02:38,318 --> 01:02:41,055
You can not hit each other.
That's my job.

688
01:02:45,190 --> 01:02:48,010
Prison uprising.

689
01:02:49,589 --> 01:02:51,939
Remove the tortilla.

690
01:03:30,790 --> 01:03:33,039
Ready
- Ready.

691
01:03:40,711 --> 01:03:43,372
Barbie?

692
01:03:44,350 --> 01:03:46,846
No more games.
Lotso What has done with Buzz?

693
01:03:46,847 --> 01:03:50,413
How we put it back
- you can not let me talk.

694
01:03:51,462 --> 01:03:54,578
I wish that you tried.

695
01:04:45,113 --> 01:04:48,103
Let's see. Hawaiian swimwear.

696
01:04:48,104 --> 01:04:50,669
Barbie, which was an original.

697
01:04:50,670 --> 01:04:53,754
Go ahead.
There are still plenty of.

698
01:04:54,299 --> 01:04:56,547
Glitter tuxedo.

699
01:04:57,308 --> 01:04:59,895
Who cares. It was still common.

700
01:05:00,691 --> 01:05:04,711
A Negro jacket.
- Not the Negro jacket.

701
01:05:04,712 --> 01:05:07,344
This is 1976?

702
01:05:07,379 --> 01:05:10,571
The Groofy collection, yes.
- What a shame.

703
01:05:10,572 --> 01:05:12,918
No.

704
01:05:12,919 --> 01:05:15,407
There is a manual.

705
01:05:15,408 --> 01:05:21,247
Lotso Buzz has put in demo mode.
- Where's the manual?

706
01:05:21,991 --> 01:05:27,058
Why could not wait until tomorrow?
Please.

707
01:05:39,679 --> 01:05:42,848
Why does it take so long?

708
01:05:46,450 --> 01:05:48,747
How can we make Buzz again?

709
01:06:05,705 --> 01:06:07,989
What are you looking at?

710
01:06:16,334 --> 01:06:19,448
Fly away, coward.

711
01:06:20,727 --> 01:06:23,071
Great.

712
01:06:30,148 --> 01:06:33,018
Give it up. No one can hear you.

713
01:06:33,415 --> 01:06:36,670
What
- No one can hear you.

714
01:06:36,972 --> 01:06:39,833
What?
- He said, 'nobody can' ...

715
01:06:39,834 --> 01:06:43,003
Silence. Woody, you're back.

716
01:06:46,287 --> 01:06:50,567
Stop him. Let him not.
- I am hostage to
my own prisoners.

717
01:06:52,935 --> 01:06:56,401
Fast. There is a switch on his back.
- Let me go, rig.

718
01:06:56,402 --> 01:06:59,123
The Galactic court has
no mercy with you.

719
01:06:59,606 --> 01:07:02,935
Why does not it?
Where's the manual?

720
01:07:02,936 --> 01:07:06,363
There's gotta be a small hole under the switch.
- A small hole. Found.

721
01:07:06,364 --> 01:07:09,479
Reset your Buzz Light year
by a paper clip in ...

722
01:07:09,898 --> 01:07:12,898
Use your finger.
- What now?

723
01:07:13,546 --> 01:07:17,418
Hold the button down
but five seconds.

724
01:07:19,673 --> 01:07:22,621
It's my fault.

725
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:31,204
Starlog, I'm awakened from hyper
sleep on a strange planet.

726
01:07:31,205 --> 01:07:33,688
What have you done?
- What you've told me.

727
01:07:33,689 --> 01:07:37,535
I am surrounded by
unknown creatures.

728
01:07:37,536 --> 01:07:40,784
Friend or foe.

729
01:07:41,482 --> 01:07:43,680
We're all friends.

730
01:07:44,299 --> 01:07:47,713
I must have crashed, and
my memory is erased.

731
01:07:48,301 --> 01:07:52,102
Has anyone seen my spaceship?
- We have to restore.

732
01:07:52,103 --> 01:07:55,028
How do we do?
- This piece is in Spanish.

733
01:07:55,607 --> 01:08:01,092
We have no time. Come on, El Buzzo.
- My ship has landed well.

734
01:08:02,344 --> 01:08:05,080
Good luck, cowboy.

735
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:11,684
Here they come.

736
01:08:13,776 --> 01:08:16,142
Buzz?

737
01:08:16,689 --> 01:08:19,306
What took you so long
- it was complicated.

738
01:08:19,307 --> 01:08:21,521
Where's Potato Head
- Not seen.

739
01:08:24,157 --> 01:08:27,545
Buzz.

740
01:08:28,115 --> 01:08:34,093
My desert flower.

741
01:08:34,662 --> 01:08:37,981
Have you made Buzz?
- Something.

742
01:08:37,982 --> 01:08:40,431
Behind you. There is someone.

743
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:46,801
You do not believe what I've
been through tonight.

744
01:08:46,802 --> 01:08:49,894
Is everything okay?
- I feel fresh and healthy.

745
01:08:49,895 --> 01:08:52,345
It's awful.
- You are dropped.

746
01:08:52,346 --> 01:08:54,577
And so big.

747
01:08:55,461 --> 01:08:57,701
You are beautiful to see
for detachable eyes.

748
01:09:03,832 --> 01:09:06,431
All safe.

749
01:09:08,124 --> 01:09:10,816
Come on.

750
01:09:11,389 --> 01:09:14,124
We're almost there.

751
01:09:17,932 --> 01:09:20,034
Backwards.

752
01:09:25,748 --> 01:09:27,845
Come on.

753
01:10:34,806 --> 01:10:38,466
Miss, you are the prettiest
flower in the room.

754
01:10:38,467 --> 01:10:41,792
And together we fight the evil.

755
01:10:45,619 --> 01:10:47,805
Woody.

756
01:10:48,161 --> 01:10:52,320
We're almost there.
- After it.

757
01:10:58,823 --> 01:11:01,663
Push me up.

758
01:11:03,888 --> 01:11:06,454
Buzz Light year comes
to the rescue.

759
01:11:11,918 --> 01:11:15,502
Open.
- Well done, Buzz. Come on.

760
01:11:18,956 --> 01:11:22,402
Is it safe?
- Where do I find out.

761
01:11:28,989 --> 01:11:32,334
Woody, are you okay?
- Yeah, come on down.

762
01:11:32,335 --> 01:11:34,624
Not all at once.
- What did he say?

763
01:11:34,625 --> 01:11:37,944
In my opinion, all at once.
- No.

764
01:11:42,635 --> 01:11:45,460
Thanks.
- You're welcome.

765
01:11:45,461 --> 01:11:49,054
We're almost there.
- Slink, you think you make it?

766
01:11:49,055 --> 01:11:52,366
I may be old, I can still jump.

767
01:11:54,574 --> 01:11:56,890
Succeeded.
- All right, Slink.

768
01:11:56,891 --> 01:11:59,774
Climb over it.

769
01:12:01,479 --> 01:12:03,913
Are you lost, little dog?

770
01:12:06,085 --> 01:12:09,789
Look who's back.

771
01:12:17,385 --> 01:12:21,747
I'm sorry, cowboy.
They have broken me.

772
01:12:21,748 --> 01:12:25,347
What do you all?
Back to your child at the races?

773
01:12:25,348 --> 01:12:28,400
He wants you anymore.
- You're lying.

774
01:12:28,401 --> 01:12:30,751
Is that so? Tell me again ...

775
01:12:30,752 --> 01:12:34,523
if your child loves you,
why is he leaving?

776
01:12:34,524 --> 01:12:38,807
Think you're special?
You're a piece of plastic ...

777
01:12:38,808 --> 01:12:41,786
made to throw away.

778
01:12:42,620 --> 01:12:45,313
When you talk about the devil.

779
01:12:49,671 --> 01:12:53,236
We have toys in our Butterfly
House needed ...

780
01:12:53,237 --> 01:12:55,867
and you must avoid the truck.

781
01:12:55,868 --> 01:12:59,948
Come back to our family back.

782
01:12:59,949 --> 01:13:04,085
This is not a family but a prison.
You are a liar and
a bully beast.

783
01:13:04,086 --> 01:13:08,141
I prefer to rot away in the garbage
truck than your family to come.

784
01:13:08,142 --> 01:13:11,915
Jessie is right.
Authority to obtain
consent by ...

785
01:13:11,916 --> 01:13:14,240
not by threat of force.

786
01:13:14,241 --> 01:13:17,803
If that's what you want.

787
01:13:18,069 --> 01:13:21,630
Wait, Barbie.
Do not do this, Lotso.

788
01:13:21,631 --> 01:13:25,820
She is a Barbie doll.
If there are one
hundred million.

789
01:13:26,692 --> 01:13:29,395
For me.

790
01:13:29,396 --> 01:13:32,512
Well, go even towards them.

791
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:41,386
Sunnyside can be great when
we see each other fairly.

792
01:13:41,387 --> 01:13:45,799
Lotso has a pyramid made us,
and stands on top of itself.

793
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:48,613
Does anyone agree with Ken?

794
01:13:51,133 --> 01:13:53,981
I have not thrown away, that
your child has done.

795
01:13:53,982 --> 01:13:58,994
They do not really like that toy, but when
you chew it in the garbage truck is.

796
01:13:58,995 --> 01:14:01,227
Wait. And then Daisy?

797
01:14:02,308 --> 01:14:07,744
I do not know what you're talking about.
- Daisy.
You did everything with her.

798
01:14:07,745 --> 01:14:11,350
Then she gave us discarded.
- No, it's your loss.

799
01:14:11,351 --> 01:14:14,017
She has replaced us.
- She replace you.

800
01:14:14,018 --> 01:14:16,195
If you could not have her,
then no one could.

801
01:14:16,196 --> 01:14:19,155
You have lied to Big Baby, and
you've lied all this time.

802
01:14:20,281 --> 01:14:22,903
Where did you get that
- she loved you, Lotso.

803
01:14:22,904 --> 01:14:26,493
She never loved me.
- So many toys as
a child can love.

804
01:14:31,899 --> 01:14:37,862
Do you want your mom back? She never loved you.
Do not be a baby.

805
01:14:39,523 --> 01:14:42,991
Push them all in there.

806
01:14:42,992 --> 01:14:45,814
This happens when you try
to think of Dumbo's.

807
01:14:45,815 --> 01:14:49,271
We all waste that will
be discarded.

808
01:14:49,272 --> 01:14:52,124
This is just a toy.

809
01:14:52,125 --> 01:14:55,646
Stop. Put me down, you idiot.

810
01:14:57,065 --> 01:15:00,924
No, wait. Baby, wait.

811
01:15:02,866 --> 01:15:05,674
He's gone.
- Holy shit.

812
01:15:10,269 --> 01:15:12,213
Hurry.

813
01:15:18,524 --> 01:15:20,998
Please.
- Come on.

814
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:27,619
Woody.

815
01:15:30,064 --> 01:15:32,472
Since there is n.

816
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:36,032
Come on.

817
01:15:36,033 --> 01:15:39,020
No, Barbie.

818
01:15:41,310 --> 01:15:44,207
Woody.

819
01:15:46,298 --> 01:15:49,571
No.

820
01:15:52,328 --> 01:15:55,019
Can you hear me?
Is everything okay?

821
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:58,324
Of course not, idiot.
We're doomed.

822
01:15:59,291 --> 01:16:01,767
Everyone at Buzz far.

823
01:16:03,908 --> 01:16:06,160
Are we all? Slinky. Rex?

824
01:16:09,912 --> 01:16:14,519
Against the wall. Quickly.
- Miss, where are you?

825
01:16:25,495 --> 01:16:28,015
That they never get.

826
01:16:36,496 --> 01:16:38,892
Watch out.

827
01:16:50,077 --> 01:16:53,115
Has anyone seen him
- I found him.

828
01:16:56,569 --> 01:16:59,890
Is everything okay?

829
01:17:11,066 --> 01:17:17,463
That I was not
- You're back.

830
01:17:17,498 --> 01:17:20,169
Yes, I'm back.
Where have I been?

831
01:17:20,170 --> 01:17:24,438
Beyond infinity, space ranger.

832
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:28,127
Where are we now.
- The garbage truck, heading
for the dustbin.

833
01:17:40,427 --> 01:17:44,446
We go there.

834
01:17:58,555 --> 01:18:01,316
Have all your parts?

835
01:18:02,464 --> 01:18:05,679
My babies.
- No, guys.

836
01:18:06,679 --> 01:18:09,011
No.

837
01:18:14,253 --> 01:18:16,754
Hold on.

838
01:18:28,917 --> 01:18:32,579
What should we do
- it'll be fine if
we stick together.

839
01:18:36,145 --> 01:18:38,933
It is a magnet. Watch out.

840
01:18:38,934 --> 01:18:40,783
No worries, Slink.
We'll get you well down.

841
01:18:40,784 --> 01:18:43,611
I see it from here.

842
01:18:47,046 --> 01:18:49,533
Grab something from solid metal.

843
01:18:53,979 --> 01:18:57,059
You heard him.

844
01:18:58,764 --> 01:19:02,233
It does not work.

845
01:19:04,710 --> 01:19:08,141
Help me. I'm trapped.

846
01:19:08,142 --> 01:19:11,423
Help me.

847
01:19:14,892 --> 01:19:17,393
Thanks.
- Not thank me now.

848
01:19:30,801 --> 01:19:32,810
Hurry.

849
01:19:37,436 --> 01:19:40,649
Thank you, Sheriff.
We are all here together.

850
01:19:40,650 --> 01:19:43,488
However, boys?

851
01:19:43,489 --> 01:19:46,902
Boys
- Woody, we're down here.

852
01:19:53,686 --> 01:19:57,639
I see daylight. We manage.

853
01:19:59,970 --> 01:20:02,640
That is no daylight.

854
01:20:07,675 --> 01:20:10,371
Run.

855
01:20:25,562 --> 01:20:29,613
Sheriff, the button. Help me.

856
01:20:29,614 --> 01:20:31,841
Come on.

857
01:20:31,842 --> 01:20:34,669
Press the button.

858
01:20:41,566 --> 01:20:44,175
Hurry.

859
01:20:46,105 --> 01:20:49,707
Press it.

860
01:20:49,708 --> 01:20:52,964
Where is your child
now, Sheriff?

861
01:20:52,965 --> 01:20:56,131
No.
- Lotso.

862
01:21:22,296 --> 01:21:27,047
What should we do?

863
01:23:14,633 --> 01:23:17,458
All those nasty things I said
about Andy's attic ...

864
01:23:17,459 --> 01:23:20,589
I take it all back.
- I.

865
01:23:20,590 --> 01:23:23,092
What you say.

866
01:23:27,674 --> 01:23:31,023
Honey, you were so brave.

867
01:23:31,691 --> 01:23:36,233
You saved our lives.
- And we are eternally grateful.

868
01:23:36,940 --> 01:23:40,300
My boys.
- Dad.

869
01:23:40,301 --> 01:23:42,065
Where is Lotso? That hairball?

870
01:23:42,066 --> 01:23:44,341
I would like to loose
or stabbing.

871
01:23:44,342 --> 01:23:47,243
Forget it, guys.
He is not worth it.

872
01:23:56,815 --> 01:24:00,172
What have you got?
- If n I had as a child.

873
01:24:00,884 --> 01:24:04,186
Strawberries.

874
01:24:06,698 --> 01:24:09,920
Keep your mouth shut.

875
01:24:15,894 --> 01:24:20,226
Woody, we need you to get home.
- It was a schoolboy.

876
01:24:20,327 --> 01:24:24,220
And you? I mean ...

877
01:24:24,221 --> 01:24:26,913
Perhaps the attic
not a great idea.

878
01:24:26,914 --> 01:24:31,260
We're Andy's toys.
- We will for him.

879
01:24:31,261 --> 01:24:33,558
Together.

880
01:24:33,559 --> 01:24:37,584
If he had not gone.
- Wait. I look here.

881
01:24:37,585 --> 01:24:42,127
Andy is still packing.
But he is almost ready.

882
01:24:42,128 --> 01:24:45,313
He lives on the other side of town.
- We're never on time.

883
01:25:01,368 --> 01:25:04,452
Come on, Buster.
- Honey, you have everything?

884
01:25:04,453 --> 01:25:07,392
Still a few boxes, Mom.
- Come on!

885
01:25:22,412 --> 01:25:25,050
The coast is safe.

886
01:25:31,671 --> 01:25:34,432
Since you already had!

887
01:25:44,702 --> 01:25:46,942
This is not goodbye.

888
01:25:47,184 --> 01:25:51,508
Woody, great fun.
- Yes, but not to much.

889
01:25:51,509 --> 01:25:56,970
Woody, take good care of Andy.
- He's a good guy ...

890
01:25:56,971 --> 01:25:59,976
but he must have a haircut.
- Will do.

891
01:26:01,444 --> 01:26:05,661
Will you save it in the attic
- Of course not ...

892
01:26:05,662 --> 01:26:09,527
In addition, I know how
to put Buzz in Spanish.

893
01:26:09,528 --> 01:26:10,935
My what?

894
01:26:15,274 --> 01:26:17,234
You know where to
find us, cowboy?

895
01:26:31,544 --> 01:26:35,091
Have you already said goodbye Molly
- At least ten times.

896
01:26:47,364 --> 01:26:50,109
Mom, it's all good.

897
01:26:53,260 --> 01:26:58,811
I wish I could stay
with you always.

898
01:26:59,967 --> 01:27:02,536
That you will too.

899
01:27:18,037 --> 01:27:20,329
Buster you gonna say goodbye?

900
01:27:20,330 --> 01:27:23,799
Of course. Who is a good dog?

901
01:27:39,643 --> 01:27:44,907
Pack your stuff.
- Buster, Molly lets
not get my stuff.

902
01:27:58,203 --> 01:28:03,494
Mom, do you really think
I should donate it?

903
01:28:03,495 --> 01:28:06,510
That you have to know sweetie.
Whatever you want.

904
01:28:32,598 --> 01:28:36,187
Do NOT go inside the haunted
in the bakery.

905
01:28:36,188 --> 01:28:39,707
Are you crazy, you still
raises the spirits.

906
01:28:39,951 --> 01:28:42,414
Watch out, the ghosts
throwing pies.

907
01:28:46,684 --> 01:28:50,388
Andy? See you at this.

908
01:28:50,389 --> 01:28:54,173
Going to high school
- yes, at this time.

909
01:28:54,234 --> 01:28:58,497
What can we do for you
- I have some toys.

910
01:28:59,459 --> 01:29:03,027
You hear that, Bonnie
- Bonnie So you're ...

911
01:29:04,337 --> 01:29:09,501
I'm Andy.
Someone told me that you
can play very well.

912
01:29:09,502 --> 01:29:13,904
These were mine, but
since I go ...

913
01:29:13,905 --> 01:29:16,753
I am looking for someone
who is very special ...

914
01:29:16,754 --> 01:29:18,383
to playing with them.

915
01:29:24,465 --> 01:29:28,287
This is Jesse's the toughest in
the entire western cowgirl ...

916
01:29:28,288 --> 01:29:32,633
she loves "critters", but not without
her best friend Bullseye.

917
01:29:35,857 --> 01:29:37,009
Look.

918
01:29:50,281 --> 01:29:55,089
This is Rex, the meanest, most terrible
dinosaur that ever was.

919
01:30:01,161 --> 01:30:06,441
Potato Heads.
Mr. and mevouw. Keep them well together,
because they are in love.

920
01:30:07,296 --> 01:30:10,676
And Slinky, is the most loyal
dog you could ever imagine.

921
01:30:11,396 --> 01:30:14,301
Hamm, saves you money ...

922
01:30:14,302 --> 01:30:19,472
but, he is the biggest crook you
know, bad doctor Pork Chop.

923
01:30:21,632 --> 01:30:27,408
And these youngsters come from a strange
alien planet, Planet Pizza.

924
01:30:29,218 --> 01:30:35,824
And this is Buzz Light year,
the coolest toy ever ...

925
01:30:35,859 --> 01:30:39,245
look, he can fly and
shoot laser ...

926
01:30:39,246 --> 01:30:43,140
He has sworn to protect the area
against the evil Emperor Zurg.

927
01:30:44,426 --> 01:30:47,526
To infinity and beyond.

928
01:30:48,725 --> 01:30:51,956
You must promise to look
after them well ..

929
01:30:55,288 --> 01:30:57,808
they mean a lot to me.

930
01:31:01,746 --> 01:31:04,738
My cowboy?

931
01:31:07,731 --> 01:31:10,819
Woody? What is he doing here?

932
01:31:10,820 --> 01:31:13,496
There's a snake in my boot.

933
01:31:16,218 --> 01:31:18,218
There's a snake in my boot.

934
01:31:32,349 --> 01:31:37,350
Woody is my friend so long
I can remember ...

935
01:31:37,845 --> 01:31:40,721
He is brave, as it
is for cowboys ...

936
01:31:41,388 --> 01:31:46,299
and sweet and smart, but what
Woody is really special ...

937
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:50,826
He will never leave, never!

938
01:31:50,827 --> 01:31:55,001
He will be there for you
through thick and thin.

939
01:31:58,320 --> 01:32:00,304
Would you care for him?

940
01:32:01,510 --> 01:32:03,348
Okay.

941
01:32:14,441 --> 01:32:17,496
Doctor Pork Chop is
the ghost bakery.

942
01:32:18,404 --> 01:32:21,107
The ghosts are leaving,
she will stop Woody.

943
01:32:21,199 --> 01:32:22,794
Buzz Light year will save them.

944
01:33:15,843 --> 01:33:18,343
Thanks, guys.

945
01:33:22,650 --> 01:33:24,883
Look mom, they all
play together.

946
01:33:24,889 --> 01:33:27,473
Come on, let's go eat.

947
01:33:41,165 --> 01:33:44,587
See ya, buddy.

948
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:54,436
