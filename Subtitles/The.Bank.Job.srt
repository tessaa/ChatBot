1
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,061
Another "Terry Leather
Low Mileage" done.

2
00:01:43,161 --> 00:01:45,502
Good you're glad, but have you all
sorted out for your wedding tomorrow?

3
00:01:45,602 --> 00:01:46,745
Yeah, of course, Terry.

4
00:01:46,845 --> 00:01:48,922
New suit, two buttons,
9 inch fun flaps.

5
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,142
<i>Nice.
Ingrid will like that.</i>

6
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,454
So, you're getting
married tomorrow, Ingrid?

7
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,386
I hope so.

8
00:01:56,486 --> 00:01:57,483
Go on, get off now.

9
00:01:57,583 --> 00:02:00,400
Go make yoursef more beautiful
than you already are.

10
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,607
If that's possible.

11
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:04,807
Terry.

12
00:02:04,907 --> 00:02:07,309
Promise you won't get Eddie
too legless tonight, will you?

13
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,512
At his stag do?

14
00:02:08,612 --> 00:02:10,612
We're just going round the pub,
couple of pints and a sing song.

15
00:02:21,512 --> 00:02:23,112
Oh, fuck...

16
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,615
Fuck it, what are you
trying to do to me, eh?

17
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,222
I've got Jessul's money.

18
00:02:32,322 --> 00:02:34,099
The problem is,
it's tied up in these cars,

19
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:36,104
and you wankers want to
trash the lot of 'em.

20
00:02:36,204 --> 00:02:38,277
Mr. Jessul doesn't care about
your inventory.

21
00:02:38,377 --> 00:02:40,100
Mr. Jessul wants to know
that he's getting paid.

22
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,715
Any day, I swear, Perky.

23
00:02:42,465 --> 00:02:44,235
What did you call me?

24
00:02:44,335 --> 00:02:46,094
I called you Perky, Perky!

25
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,468
Everyone calls you Perky,
and him Pinkey.

26
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:50,300
- Pinkey and Perky?
- Yeah.

27
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,228
They're fucking cartoon pigs
on the telly,

28
00:02:52,328 --> 00:02:54,521
what, people call us
that behind our backs?

29
00:02:54,621 --> 00:02:56,340
Well, theyre not gonna say it to your face,
aren't they?

30
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,136
Well, you just bloody did!

31
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:03,610
Yeah well, you got me rattled.
I'm very intimidated.

32
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,978
Don't make us come back again.

33
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,360
Not every customer is
a satisfied customer.

34
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,254
What are you doing round
here, my dear Martine?

35
00:03:25,354 --> 00:03:26,424
What are you doing tonight?

36
00:03:26,524 --> 00:03:29,125
Tonight?
Tonight is Eddie's stag do.

37
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:31,559
Taking him out for a drink.
Why?

38
00:03:31,659 --> 00:03:33,828
I've got a proposition for you, Terry.

39
00:03:33,978 --> 00:03:34,928
A proposition?

40
00:03:35,028 --> 00:03:37,124
Can you meet me at the Player's Club
before you see the boys?

41
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,628
And I'll fill you in on the details.

42
00:03:39,728 --> 00:03:40,983
Make it 9 o'clock.

43
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,142
- Morning, Gale.
- Good morning, Tim.

44
00:03:47,242 --> 00:03:49,918
Top floor?
Summoned by the gods?

45
00:03:50,018 --> 00:03:50,877
Something like that.

46
00:03:50,977 --> 00:03:52,696
Got up for your new
mistress this weekend?

47
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,930
I don't know what you're talking about,
I'm a married man.

48
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,845
What do you think,
am I presentable?

49
00:03:59,945 --> 00:04:02,624
Not sure about the tie, darling.

50
00:04:02,724 --> 00:04:05,547
What's this?
"Peace and Love"?

51
00:04:05,647 --> 00:04:09,656
Too much of that nonsense
and we're both out of a job.

52
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,992
Michael Abdul Malik.
Calls himself Michael X,

53
00:04:14,092 --> 00:04:16,869
in homage to Malcolm X,
his American counterpart.

54
00:04:16,969 --> 00:04:20,189
The Pinko press would
have us believe this Michael X

55
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:22,849
is a crusading champion
of the poor and oppressed.

56
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,545
And the black Robin Hood
of Notting Hill.

57
00:04:25,644 --> 00:04:29,000
The richer, whiter and more famous,
the more they fall over him

58
00:04:29,099 --> 00:04:31,242
The truth is, he's a slum landlord,
a drug dealer

59
00:04:31,392 --> 00:04:33,806
and a vicious pimp who should have
been in prison years ago.

60
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,316
Are you not charging outrageous rents
to my brothers and sisters, Mr. Brown?

61
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:43,525
I'm charging the same as your
slum-lord friend Lew Vogel.

62
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:46,499
Ten quids a week is too
much for these shitholes.

63
00:04:47,299 --> 00:04:48,679
You know,

64
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:52,675
I always wanted to meet
a white man by the name of Brown.

65
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:58,023
You know what this is?
It's a slave collar.

66
00:04:58,123 --> 00:05:00,610
And a white man made my mothers
and fathers wear this

67
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,210
to bend them to his will.

68
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,220
Can I bend you to my will,
Mr. Brown?

69
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,500
You sure got a faithful
dog now, Michael.

70
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,657
Michael, I don't think we
should get our hopes up here.

71
00:05:15,807 --> 00:05:17,221
Kidnappning, extortion,

72
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,485
assault on this man Brown here,

73
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,800
as well as your previous problems
with the law, I mean...

74
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,900
You could be looking
at 10 to 20 years.

75
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,795
I don't think so. I am smarter
and better protected than whitey thinks.

76
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:30,189
<i>All rise.</i>

77
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,476
<i>It seems Michael X has managed
to keep himself out of jail</i>

78
00:05:36,576 --> 00:05:37,889
<i>by threatening to release</i>

79
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:42,000
damning photographs of a
certain... royal personage.

80
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,806
Until we get our hands on these snaps,
the police can't move.

81
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,443
The public prosecutor won't move...

82
00:05:50,543 --> 00:05:52,242
and the home office
doesn't want to know.

83
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,830
Has anyone actually
seen these photographs?

84
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:57,920
Yes, but at the minute
I'm not at liberty...

85
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,766
to say who that person is.

86
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,276
We've had Michael X under surveillance
for quite a while.

87
00:06:02,376 --> 00:06:04,028
He keeps a safe deposit
box at the Lloyd's Bank...

88
00:06:04,128 --> 00:06:04,596
in Marylebone.

89
00:06:04,696 --> 00:06:07,500
We believe that's where
the photos are located.

90
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,585
Seems straightforward enough.

91
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,827
I'll send a team into this bank

92
00:06:12,927 --> 00:06:14,786
and take whatever he's got
in this safe deposit box.

93
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,363
That would have to be sanctioned
at the highest level,

94
00:06:17,513 --> 00:06:19,347
and that's not going to happen.

95
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,435
Do you see our problem?

96
00:06:22,535 --> 00:06:25,436
There can be no connection to 5 or 6.

97
00:06:25,536 --> 00:06:27,003
So you want me to come up with something

98
00:06:27,103 --> 00:06:29,456
to avoid getting accountability for anyone.

99
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,502
We'd welcome suggestions, Tim.

100
00:06:31,602 --> 00:06:35,359
And if it all goes pear-shaped,
I assume it's my arse on the line?

101
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:39,712
You're young and ambitions, Tim.
A chance to make a name for yourself.

102
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,689
Thank you, Sir.

103
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,366
Excuse me there, miss.
Can I have a word?

104
00:06:50,516 --> 00:06:51,263
Yes.

105
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,500
- Where have you been?
- Morocco.

106
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,655
- I'll have to check your underwear.
- Be my guest.

107
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,697
- We found what we're looking for.
- Found what?

108
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,065
What were you looking for?

109
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,538
Oh Tim, thank God!

110
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,829
I'm in a spot of bother.

111
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,205
- What have you been up to?
- Nothing much. You?

112
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,416
I was in Morocco recently.

113
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,667
- Business or pleasure?
- Bit of both.

114
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,032
Drinks are on me.

115
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,442
So, we're gonna sit here all night,
making small-talk?

116
00:07:30,542 --> 00:07:34,559
I know you, Terry,
and I know your mates.

117
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,900
You've always been looking for
the big score,

118
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
the one that makes sense of everything.

119
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,784
- I have it for you.
- What?

120
00:07:43,884 --> 00:07:48,921
- A bank.
- A bank... as in robber?

121
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,834
What would you know about a bank?

122
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,510
I've been seeing this guy
who runs his own business.

123
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,902
Security systems.

124
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:01,041
Next month, they're installing
new alarms in a bank at Marylebone.

125
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,360
Seems like the trains have been...

126
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,821
setting off the trembler
alarms in the vault

127
00:08:03,921 --> 00:08:05,714
and they've had to turn them off.

128
00:08:05,814 --> 00:08:08,362
So for a week or so,
they won't have any.

129
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,425
Now why would he tell you all this?

130
00:08:12,975 --> 00:08:14,927
We were having a laugh about it.

131
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,522
Imagine if half the villains in
in London knew about this, he said.

132
00:08:18,622 --> 00:08:21,059
And I thought, I know half
the villains in London.

133
00:08:21,309 --> 00:08:22,896
I grew up with some of them.

134
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,394
Look, me and my mates might have 
been involved in the odd bit of

135
00:08:26,494 --> 00:08:27,786
skullduggery.

136
00:08:27,886 --> 00:08:28,734
Can you see us tooled up,

137
00:08:28,834 --> 00:08:30,401
taking on a bank like
the James gang?

138
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,239
This isn't about waving a
waterpistol at a cashier's head.

139
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,086
This is about getting into the basement
where the deposit boxes are.

140
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,629
Hidden, secret wealth.
Money and jewels, they're safe to steal,

141
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:43,101
- 'cause people won't report it.
- Oh, no no no.

142
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,550
You can't talk about this here.

143
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,443
It's a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity, Terry.

144
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,600
We can't pass it up.

145
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,500
I didn't expect this
from you tonight, Martine.

146
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,283
What did you expect?

147
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,300
I'll have to think about it.

148
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,991
You better get off to your stag party.

149
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:11,339
Thanks for the drink.

150
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,500
Eddie tells me his brother invited you
to the wedding.

151
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,871
- Are you going?
- I'll see you there.

152
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,065
Can I get a Campari and Soda, no ice?
- Yes, sir.

153
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,508
Thank you.

154
00:09:39,758 --> 00:09:41,700
Well, Tim sweety,
what do you think?

155
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,085
- Is he offering?
- Maybe.

156
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,945
Cheers, gorgeous.

157
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,441
- So you coming in?
- I don't know, it's late.

158
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:12,221
Do you need to run home
like a good little boy?

159
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,358
I guess I've got time.

160
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:34,143
- What exactly do you do?
- Bit of this, bit of that.

161
00:10:34,243 --> 00:10:35,820
How did you and Hakim meet?

162
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,592
I met Hakim in Los Angeles
last spring.

163
00:10:38,692 --> 00:10:40,887
He was rasing money for a black
Montessori school

164
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,352
and writing his life's story.

165
00:10:42,452 --> 00:10:44,466
And what an extraordinary
life it has been.

166
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,111
The book is called "From the Dead Level,
Malcolm X and Me."

167
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:51,737
I've read the manuscript.
Hakim is a poet.

168
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,862
The voice of the black soul.

169
00:10:53,962 --> 00:10:55,386
A friend is throwing a thing next week

170
00:10:55,486 --> 00:10:57,388
to celebrate the launch of
Brother Hakim's book,

171
00:10:57,488 --> 00:10:59,414
and you are all invited.

172
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,128
Hakim, tell us more about your book.

173
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,469
It's about being born black
in America.

174
00:11:07,569 --> 00:11:11,190
Can any of you imagine what it is like
to be born a black man in this world?

175
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,882
Can any of you white women
imagine what it would be like

176
00:11:15,982 --> 00:11:18,076
to bring a black baby into this world?

177
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,592
Good evening, sir.

178
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,401
What, you freakhead? Why are we
even having this conversation?

179
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,337
We're not-

180
00:12:03,387 --> 00:12:04,645
Here's your beer.

181
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,444
<i>We are not bankrobbers.</i>

182
00:12:09,544 --> 00:12:11,900
Maybe that's why we
could get away with it.

183
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,888
It's a bit daunting, isn't it?

184
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,416
You know what scares me more?

185
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,923
Living and dying with
nothing to show for it.

186
00:12:19,069 --> 00:12:21,586
You know how old Mozart was
when he composed his first minuet?

187
00:12:21,787 --> 00:12:24,572
- No.
- Five. Five! A fucking minuet!

188
00:12:24,907 --> 00:12:26,585
And how would you know that fact, Terry?

189
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,744
Because it's tattooed on
that stripper's arse, Kevin.

190
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,054
What the fuck's it matter how I know?

191
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,032
It's a fact and you're
missing the point, Kev.

192
00:12:34,132 --> 00:12:35,168
What I'm trying to say is,

193
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,644
we stop fucking about and stop...

194
00:12:36,744 --> 00:12:38,367
picking the shit from
under our fingernails.

195
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,166
Shtum, lads.
Coppers at 12 o'clock.

196
00:12:53,866 --> 00:12:55,066
Damn...

197
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,341
What are you two doing here,
personally?

198
00:12:58,441 --> 00:13:00,561
I thought you were way past
being a bagman, Jerry.

199
00:13:00,661 --> 00:13:04,608
Your associate Sonia Bern has raised
prices at that knocking shop of hers.

200
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,575
- £120 quid up from a £100.
- And your point?

201
00:13:07,674 --> 00:13:10,356
A rising tide lifts all ships, mate.

202
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,783
I think we are owed some money.

203
00:13:12,882 --> 00:13:15,554
- Cause even Sonia's can be raided.
- Yeah, you would do that, wouldn't you?

204
00:13:15,654 --> 00:13:17,665
You'd kill the goose that
lays you golden eggs.

205
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,350
Wouldn't that be dumb, would it?

206
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,479
But then again,
everyone knows coppers are dumb.

207
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,991
Now you can do one thing for me.

208
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,242
You stop your collegues from
having their boys night out in my clubs.

209
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:39,274
They're loud, they're lewd
and they expect free oral sex.

210
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,925
You know what, that's disgusting.
Ya know, most of them have families.

211
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,715
We'll pass the word along.

212
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,148
Lew, you tell your
greedy little bobbies...

213
00:14:02,248 --> 00:14:03,996
to find their
perks elsewhere.

214
00:14:04,096 --> 00:14:05,623
No one is going to bother me.

215
00:14:05,723 --> 00:14:08,919
My patrons could have a lot of these
old coppers put out to pasture.

216
00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:11,093
Well, I'd say, spread the wealth around
and keep the peace.

217
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,314
Five quid a week extra.

218
00:14:13,414 --> 00:14:16,270
- It's all it's worth.
- I'll pass it on.

219
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:30,795
- Drysdale.
- Urquhart.

220
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:37,100
Lord Drysdale, can I offer you a drink
before your session?

221
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,861
Very kind of you, Sonia.

222
00:14:40,961 --> 00:14:45,943
- Good to see you.
- As well, Urquhart, as well.

223
00:14:51,543 --> 00:14:52,843
Good girl.

224
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,685
Tighter!
Yes, that's a good girl.

225
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,731
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

226
00:15:18,531 --> 00:15:19,531
Louder.

227
00:15:20,231 --> 00:15:21,531
Louder!

228
00:15:21,831 --> 00:15:23,231
Come on.

229
00:15:30,431 --> 00:15:32,431
<i>We want a kiss,
what's wrong with you?</i>

230
00:15:34,031 --> 00:15:36,031
- I just can't.
- Come on...

231
00:15:37,031 --> 00:15:38,531
<i>Give her a snogging, babe.</i>

232
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,089
Hello.

233
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,776
Saw you in a magazine the other day.

234
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,583
The Campari ad on the beach.
Nice.

235
00:16:01,683 --> 00:16:03,794
Must have been an old one,
I'm not modeling any more.

236
00:16:03,893 --> 00:16:06,989
I don't know why.
You're still a knockout.

237
00:16:07,088 --> 00:16:09,550
- What are you doing these days, Dave?
- Me?

238
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:12,723
A bit of film work.
Extra, you know.

239
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,757
And you, Kevin?
You're still snapping, I see.

240
00:16:14,857 --> 00:16:15,543
The wedding photos?

241
00:16:15,643 --> 00:16:17,182
No no, these are just
photos for the family.

242
00:16:17,281 --> 00:16:19,467
Fashion is my game.
Fashion and passports.

243
00:16:19,567 --> 00:16:22,449
- And the odd snap of a wayward husband.
- Thank you, Dave.

244
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,290
So, what's the verdict, boys?

245
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,100
We're interested.

246
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,964
First thing we should do
is take a look at the place,

247
00:16:29,064 --> 00:16:30,064
suss it out.

248
00:16:30,164 --> 00:16:32,388
- Maybe open a box of our own.
- I've already done that.

249
00:16:32,487 --> 00:16:34,243
We can go and have a look tomorrow.

250
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,437
Tomorrow it is.

251
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,387
Heads up, lads.

252
00:16:40,486 --> 00:16:43,307
- She's adorable, your little one.
- She is off.

253
00:16:43,406 --> 00:16:45,421
And what a gorgeous flower girl
your eldest made.

254
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:46,943
Thanks. Catherine.

255
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,824
I do envy you.

256
00:16:49,924 --> 00:16:51,296
- Kev, you want to dance?
- Yeah, come on.

257
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,667
It was lovely to see you all.

258
00:16:52,767 --> 00:16:54,173
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

259
00:16:54,273 --> 00:16:56,273
- All right, mate.
- All right.

260
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,516
She envies me...
She's being sarcastic?

261
00:17:01,616 --> 00:17:05,639
I suppose what she meant was,
money can't by what we have.

262
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,075
Didn't you use to go out with her?

263
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:09,704
No love, that was Kevin.

264
00:17:09,804 --> 00:17:12,110
He had this big thing for her.

265
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,875
- And you didn't?
- No.

266
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,839
Not like me and you,
love at first sight.

267
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:18,939
Oh yeah...

268
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,276
I remember that night, you were
with your mate Audrey at that disco.

269
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:26,170
I saw this gorgeous little bum
in a pencil skirt

270
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,676
and I thought:
"Oh, I've gotta have that."

271
00:17:28,776 --> 00:17:30,991
But that Audrey she already had a bloke,
so I pulled you.

272
00:17:31,141 --> 00:17:32,342
Cheeky sod.

273
00:17:32,442 --> 00:17:37,924
Daddy, daddy, come and dance with me.
Come on, dad.

274
00:17:54,624 --> 00:17:56,624
Hands off me.

275
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,120
Good morning.

276
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,620
I'd like to access my
safe deposit box, please.

277
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,796
- Martine Love. L-O-V-E.
- Certainly, madam.

278
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,593
- You're an actor, right?
- That's right.

279
00:18:45,693 --> 00:18:47,522
I did a couple of films
for you, Mr. Vogel.

280
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,543
Yeah, right.

281
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,569
So what are these films you're in?

282
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:57,791
Forget about it.

283
00:18:57,891 --> 00:18:59,037
Go on.

284
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,931
Technically, it's what you'd call...

285
00:19:03,081 --> 00:19:04,461
pornography.

286
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,788
- You're joking?
- No.

287
00:19:06,888 --> 00:19:08,552
So you've been going around town with a

288
00:19:08,652 --> 00:19:10,627
12 inch mutton dagger
hanging down your pants?

289
00:19:10,727 --> 00:19:13,565
That's nothing to be ashamed of.

290
00:19:46,265 --> 00:19:47,265
Nice.

291
00:19:47,965 --> 00:19:48,965
Fake.

292
00:19:49,065 --> 00:19:51,580
For the posh party at the weekend.

293
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,256
This is the one.
The lease is available.

294
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,823
Finally.

295
00:20:18,924 --> 00:20:22,333
- How do I look? Good?
- Not your best, Dave.

296
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,867
Here we go.

297
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,238
So how come you've got the inside
dope on this place, Martine?

298
00:20:27,338 --> 00:20:29,675
She knows this bloke,
runs a security company.

299
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,164
Bloke? Is it serious?
Are you getting married?

300
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:35,376
He is married.
All the best ones are.

301
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:36,576
Here we go.

302
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,659
Marylebone Road and Baker Street,
on the corner here is the bank,

303
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,254
next door is the Chicken Inn,
and at 189, Le Sac.

304
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,080
In the back here is an underground
car park

305
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,685
with direct access to
the shops' basements.

306
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,729
We can pull in here from
Glentworth Street...

307
00:20:49,829 --> 00:20:50,526
into the car park

308
00:20:50,626 --> 00:20:53,273
for dropoffs and pickups
without being seen from the street.

309
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,311
We'll dig a tunnel from the basement
of the shop

310
00:20:55,411 --> 00:20:58,572
under the Chicken Inn and pop up
in the safe deposit vault.

311
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,427
I've got a question.

312
00:21:00,527 --> 00:21:03,132
What do us lot know
about digging tunnels?

313
00:21:03,232 --> 00:21:03,634
Nothing.

314
00:21:03,734 --> 00:21:05,429
But I know a man who does.

315
00:21:05,529 --> 00:21:09,092
- So what do you reckon, Bambas?
- What do I reckon?

316
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,149
I reckon I know you guys,
but I don't know her.

317
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,153
Don't worry about Martine,
she's solid.

318
00:21:15,254 --> 00:21:16,099
We go way back.

319
00:21:16,249 --> 00:21:18,751
Terry, you have been up to
some mischief in your time

320
00:21:18,851 --> 00:21:21,746
but this, this is serious shit,
my friend.

321
00:21:21,846 --> 00:21:23,623
Don't you think it's a little
out of your league?

322
00:21:23,723 --> 00:21:26,941
Maybe it's time we stepped up
to the first division.

323
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,270
There's going to be reinforced concrete
under the vault.

324
00:21:33,371 --> 00:21:36,676
We're going to need a thermic lance,
a jackhammer, a generator,

325
00:21:36,776 --> 00:21:38,559
lights, ropes, cables, the works.

326
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,867
It's about 40 feet of digging
before we're under the bank.

327
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:43,153
We can hire some Micks from
Camden Town to do the digging

328
00:21:43,254 --> 00:21:44,544
That's brilliant, Dave.

329
00:21:44,644 --> 00:21:47,110
Why don't we just pay their
national ensurance contributions?

330
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:49,737
And then you have to get dirt on
your Tommy Nutter suit.

331
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,207
- This way, Michael. One more shot.
- This way.

332
00:21:53,007 --> 00:21:54,707
Thank you, that was great.

333
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,947
- What are your plans?
- I am returning to Trinidad...

334
00:22:00,047 --> 00:22:02,175
to liberate my brothers and sisters

335
00:22:02,275 --> 00:22:05,272
from the enslavement of
the British colonialists.

336
00:22:05,373 --> 00:22:08,426
What about the charges you are facing?
How can you leave England?

337
00:22:08,526 --> 00:22:10,578
They are liars and cowards.

338
00:22:10,678 --> 00:22:13,034
If they had anything against me
but their fear of me,

339
00:22:13,134 --> 00:22:15,099
I'd be tried and jailed.

340
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,656
See you later, Bambas.

341
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,395
But we gonna need a front man
on this,

342
00:22:18,495 --> 00:22:21,078
someone who can sign the lease on
the shop and looks the business.

343
00:22:21,178 --> 00:22:23,941
I know someone, Guy Singer.
Calls himself "The Major".

344
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:25,841
But that's a lot of bollocks,

345
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,508
He has got this white posh accent
if anyone comes nosing about.

346
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,289
A bit tight under the
arms, dont you think?

347
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,551
Traditional fit, sir.

348
00:22:36,651 --> 00:22:38,643
One can't raise ones
arms above one's head.

349
00:22:38,793 --> 00:22:41,491
It tends to inhibit any
impulsive acts of surrender.

350
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,948
I'll be right back, sir.

351
00:22:47,048 --> 00:22:49,354
What on earth are you doing here?

352
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,805
Got a bit of business for you, Guy.
You'll be tempted.

353
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,602
Sit down, luv.

354
00:23:03,702 --> 00:23:05,905
What do you think you're doing?

355
00:23:06,005 --> 00:23:07,649
Taking the E
for a test drive.

356
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,397
Tell your boss, he can
have his inventory back

357
00:23:09,547 --> 00:23:10,932
when he settles Mr. Jessul's debt.

358
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,962
And it'd better be soon

359
00:23:13,062 --> 00:23:16,235
or we'll be back to tap
through his kneecaps.

360
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,456
If I was you two,
I was looking for another job.

361
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,587
Lovely.

362
00:23:28,687 --> 00:23:30,475
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

363
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,081
So, come on then, what don't I know?
Romantic dinner on a Monday night?

364
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,115
Look honey,

365
00:23:45,216 --> 00:23:49,436
I'm going to be working some strange
hours over the next week or two, so...

366
00:23:49,536 --> 00:23:52,990
don't ask me what I'm doing,
because I don't want to lie to you.

367
00:23:53,091 --> 00:23:55,146
What are you doing?

368
00:23:57,196 --> 00:23:57,940
Look...

369
00:23:58,041 --> 00:24:02,739
I know I've caused us a few problems
but those cars aren't selling

370
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:06,789
All I was trying to do
is get ahead of the game.

371
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:09,116
- This thing's gonna put us there.
- OK.

372
00:24:09,266 --> 00:24:10,248
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

373
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,030
And a better place.

374
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,269
It's for all of us.

375
00:24:16,369 --> 00:24:18,995
For you and the kids.

376
00:24:19,095 --> 00:24:21,369
And how afraid do I have to be, Terry?

377
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:31,360
It'd be the best smart thing if you
wanted to stay with your aunt,

378
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:34,989
in case things to custard.

379
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:47,114
So, we are settled. 25% to run
my girls till I return from Trinidad.

380
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,104
It's all right,
you don't have to worry.

381
00:24:50,204 --> 00:24:53,567
I'll look after your little flock
of birds like they were my own.

382
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,837
As long as you remember
they are not your own.

383
00:24:56,937 --> 00:24:58,144
Lew, while I'm back in Trinidad,

384
00:24:58,294 --> 00:25:00,156
I can arrange for shipment of some
high grade gunja.

385
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,786
Not interested.

386
00:25:01,886 --> 00:25:03,546
You want my opinion?

387
00:25:03,646 --> 00:25:05,298
I think drugs are responsible for...

388
00:25:05,398 --> 00:25:07,184
the moral decay of
this countries' young.

389
00:25:07,284 --> 00:25:09,898
Smut, smut and more smut.

390
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,720
That's my special area of interest.

391
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,781
You should think about it.

392
00:25:12,881 --> 00:25:14,576
With these goodies you can make
a lot of dough,

393
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,170
especially the police in your pocket.

394
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,068
I am paying enough bung as it is,

395
00:25:18,169 --> 00:25:19,928
but probably not as much
as you're donating

396
00:25:20,078 --> 00:25:22,600
to be permitted to leave our
fair shores.

397
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:27,174
Not a shilling! I have something
so special, I don't need to pay anyone.

398
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,228
And what would that be, Michael?

399
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:31,119
Sorry, Lew.

400
00:25:31,369 --> 00:25:32,627
Well.

401
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,756
Whatever it is, you crafty bugger,
I hope you're keeping it safe.

402
00:25:35,856 --> 00:25:40,243
Yes, as safe as it can be.
In the place that you recommended.

403
00:25:41,592 --> 00:25:43,776
- You're late.
- Sorry.

404
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,473
This is the Major.
Major Guy Singer.

405
00:25:47,573 --> 00:25:49,263
Final member of our team.

406
00:25:49,363 --> 00:25:51,505
I don't know this man.
Who are you?

407
00:25:51,605 --> 00:25:53,112
None of your business.

408
00:25:53,212 --> 00:25:55,584
No secrets around here.
The Major is a con artist.

409
00:25:55,685 --> 00:25:57,454
Usually elderly widows.

410
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,961
There's no need to bring that up.

411
00:25:59,061 --> 00:26:01,339
Now he's the official
new owner of Le Sac.

412
00:26:01,489 --> 00:26:03,746
Handbags and leather accesories
for the discerning lady.

413
00:26:04,446 --> 00:26:05,446
Nice.

414
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:08,260
I told the district planner's
office about the remodelling.

415
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:12,267
They gave me the specs for the
sewage, drainage, gas and power lines.

416
00:26:12,367 --> 00:26:15,143
We'll have to go deep
to miss that lot.

417
00:26:15,244 --> 00:26:16,537
What's this for?

418
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,621
That is the thermic lance.
It cuts through concrete and metal.

419
00:26:20,721 --> 00:26:24,760
We're doing this, right?
I mean, we're bloody going for it.

420
00:26:24,861 --> 00:26:26,205
Let's see what this thing can do.

421
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,758
Good idea, Kev.
Give us a demonstration, Bambas.

422
00:26:28,859 --> 00:26:30,666
Ok, hold this.
Hold it. Here.

423
00:26:30,766 --> 00:26:33,271
Kevin, go stand over there
by the oxygen.

424
00:26:33,371 --> 00:26:34,871
Here we go.

425
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,196
Turn it off!

426
00:26:51,546 --> 00:26:53,126
Off! Off! Off!

427
00:26:54,326 --> 00:26:55,326
Not good.

428
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,169
They know what they're doing,
these people, do they?

429
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,872
Absolutely.
Professional criminals.

430
00:26:59,973 --> 00:27:01,542
What's the worst case scenario?

431
00:27:01,643 --> 00:27:03,222
They get caught and go to jail.

432
00:27:03,322 --> 00:27:04,672
No possible connection to us.

433
00:27:04,773 --> 00:27:06,751
What about this model you're screwing?

434
00:27:06,901 --> 00:27:08,789
What promises have you made
to keep her in line?

435
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:10,706
None that can't be broken.

436
00:27:10,806 --> 00:27:13,246
Look, she's our only tie
to the bank operation.

437
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,565
If things do go belly up

438
00:27:14,665 --> 00:27:17,266
it'll only take one
cut to sever the knot.

439
00:27:17,366 --> 00:27:19,473
What's Gale Benson up to?

440
00:27:19,574 --> 00:27:22,343
I believe she's working her way
into Michael X's inner sanctum.

441
00:27:22,444 --> 00:27:25,873
Could you sign that book, please?
I've got them finally together.

442
00:27:25,973 --> 00:27:27,338
Daddy!

443
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,836
I am so glad you decided to come.

444
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,598
This is my father, Sir Leonard Plugge.

445
00:27:35,698 --> 00:27:37,064
Always happy to meet Gale's new friends.

446
00:27:37,164 --> 00:27:39,145
Her new name is Hale Kimga.

447
00:27:39,246 --> 00:27:42,114
It's an anagram
of the letters of our names:

448
00:27:42,215 --> 00:27:43,838
Hakim and Gale.

449
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:47,339
- And your name is?
- Hakim. Hakim Jamal.

450
00:27:47,439 --> 00:27:48,439
Right.

451
00:27:49,639 --> 00:27:50,939
Excuse me...

452
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,925
Hello, gorgeous.

453
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,229
So, where's the author?

454
00:28:00,329 --> 00:28:02,379
He's over there,
signing his masterpiece.

455
00:28:02,479 --> 00:28:04,439
Why don't you both drop by
the house this weekend

456
00:28:04,489 --> 00:28:06,339
and introduce Mr. Jamal to mother?

457
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,894
Sorry daddy, can't do that.

458
00:28:07,994 --> 00:28:10,484
We're popping on
to the islands for a while.

459
00:28:10,584 --> 00:28:14,997
- Let me get you a drink.
- Good luck with your book.

460
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:21,151
- So you've read this book of his?
- You must be joking.

461
00:28:21,251 --> 00:28:23,741
Right.
You're probably undercover,

462
00:28:23,842 --> 00:28:27,287
spying on Black Power's insidious
threat to the British way of life.

463
00:28:27,387 --> 00:28:28,481
That's very funny.

464
00:28:28,831 --> 00:28:31,427
Tell me, is our little enterprise
still shipshape?

465
00:28:31,527 --> 00:28:33,063
We're currently on schedule, Tim.

466
00:28:33,164 --> 00:28:36,034
We're taking over the shop
on Friday afternoon.

467
00:28:36,135 --> 00:28:38,523
I know if this stuffs up
I'm in poo poo land.

468
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,570
We have a blue Transit van
that's just pulled up.

469
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,592
"Clacy Builders" on the side.

470
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,228
And we have one man entering the shop.

471
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,119
Construction crew, for Le Sac.

472
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,988
I've got a question.

473
00:30:18,088 --> 00:30:20,238
What do we do with all the dirt
we're gonna dig out of the hole?

474
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:21,690
That's all been worked out, Dave.

475
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:25,355
We'll dig another hole over there
and put in in that. Over.

476
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:29,308
If we're to get the job done
before the bank opens on Monday morning,

477
00:30:29,409 --> 00:30:30,426
we better get a wriggle on.

478
00:30:30,576 --> 00:30:31,784
Want to do the honours, Martine?

479
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:36,867
This is it,
here we go.

480
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,640
Watch your nails, Martine.

481
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,740
Yeah, yeah.

482
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,640
Let's get this store to rock.

483
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:07,214
- Some racket there Alf?
- Bloody hell! What's going on?

484
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,397
Dave, come on, mate.

485
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,388
Dave, you need a break.
I'll take over.

486
00:31:36,538 --> 00:31:38,154
Cheers, Major.

487
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,846
Heads up!

488
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,059
- Where's Dave?
- No idea.

489
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,943
Where did you get to?

490
00:31:57,044 --> 00:31:58,754
Just checking the door was locked.

491
00:31:58,854 --> 00:32:01,688
Of course it's locked, Dave.
I locked it.

492
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,282
Hang on.
What we got here?

493
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,998
A copper.

494
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:15,121
Christ, he's not going in there, is he?

495
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,603
- I'll go.
- Shit! Dave, Dave, get back.

496
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,393
- I only wanted-
- Stop! Hold it down!

497
00:32:21,543 --> 00:32:22,731
Someone is knocking.
Someone is at the door.

498
00:32:22,831 --> 00:32:24,831
Stop, Stop! There's somebody
at the door of the shop.

499
00:32:25,631 --> 00:32:27,038
Bambas!

500
00:32:27,138 --> 00:32:29,138
Bambas!
Hold on!

501
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,078
There's somebody at the door.

502
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,634
- Look, I don't mind going.
- It's my job.

503
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,370
Coppers.

504
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:49,970
It's the Old Bill.

505
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,426
Good evening.
You're working late?

506
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,709
Around the clock, officer.
Expanding our storage.

507
00:33:03,809 --> 00:33:05,253
Trying to complete renovations
for the grand.....

508
00:33:05,403 --> 00:33:06,714
If you don't mind, sir.

509
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,361
Excuse me?

510
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,723
You using a jackhammer down there?

511
00:33:15,823 --> 00:33:18,103
Yeah. You had some
complaints, officer?

512
00:33:18,203 --> 00:33:20,000
Yeah, from some of your neighbours.

513
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,679
We'll try to keep it down, alright?

514
00:33:25,579 --> 00:33:26,579
Right.

515
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,944
I wonder how they
talked their way out of that one.

516
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,953
Tim, Quinn here.

517
00:33:36,703 --> 00:33:39,191
We just had a copper
going into the shop.

518
00:33:39,291 --> 00:33:41,410
<i>Not sure why, but he's gone now.</i>

519
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,006
All clear.

520
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,918
We need a lookout,
someone on a roof somewhere.

521
00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:51,783
- We've got the walkie-talkies.
- What about Eddie?

522
00:33:51,884 --> 00:33:53,226
He's a good lad,
we can trust him.

523
00:33:53,327 --> 00:33:54,986
No. Look, we're not cutting
anyone else in.

524
00:33:55,086 --> 00:33:56,490
We won't cut him in on the loot.

525
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,078
We'll give him the car lot.

526
00:33:58,178 --> 00:34:00,601
Hopefully I won't need
that headache anymore.

527
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,525
- My God, not again.
- Get up there, Major.

528
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:04,855
Cover that up!

529
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,154
It's not the coppers.

530
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,526
- Yes, can I help you?
- Delivery for Dave Shilling.

531
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,600
- And what is it?
- Chicken and chips.

532
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,763
I see...

533
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,166
- Takeaway for Mr. Shilling.
- Thanks.

534
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:39,395
- You can't be serious.
- I was starving.

535
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,467
Radio is in the bag,
binoculars as well.

536
00:34:55,567 --> 00:34:57,385
There's a bedsit on the
top floor of this building,

537
00:34:57,486 --> 00:34:59,109
paid for the week.

538
00:34:59,209 --> 00:35:00,546
The  ladder will
get you to the roof.

539
00:35:00,646 --> 00:35:02,551
You're in from Liverpool,
looking for work.

540
00:35:02,651 --> 00:35:03,891
I don't have a Liverpool accent.

541
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,725
Then don't talk to anyone, Eddie.

542
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,662
I'm up on the roof, and...

543
00:35:48,762 --> 00:35:50,272
I've got a good view

544
00:35:50,372 --> 00:35:51,748
<i>of all directions, over.</i>

545
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:55,977
Are you in position, Nightjar?
Command HQ here. Acknowledge.

546
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:59,237
Yeah, I'm in position.
I can see the front of the bank,

547
00:35:59,337 --> 00:36:01,305
Marylebone Road,

548
00:36:01,406 --> 00:36:03,827
Baker Street, I can see
everything really well.

549
00:36:03,927 --> 00:36:06,623
<i>All clear on the Western front, Guy.
Over.</i>

550
00:36:06,723 --> 00:36:09,865
<i>- No names, Eddie.
- Sorry, Dave.</i>

551
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,155
Hey you delinquent.
What have I told you?

552
00:36:13,305 --> 00:36:14,630
<i>No idle chitchat.</i>

553
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:17,130
Sorry, T-
Over.

554
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,630
Fuckin' hell...

555
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,133
Wakey wakey, gentlemen.

556
00:36:25,233 --> 00:36:27,188
I'll keep an eye on
the shop from here on.

557
00:36:27,289 --> 00:36:29,071
You two go down to Glentworth Street.

558
00:36:29,171 --> 00:36:30,596
Guard the parking garage exit.

559
00:36:30,697 --> 00:36:31,947
Okay.

560
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:53,583
Nightjar here, there's some fellow
looking through the window.

561
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,183
<i>Hang on.</i>

562
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,999
Wait, hang on. He's going.
He's going.

563
00:37:01,499 --> 00:37:02,999
Yeah, he's gone.
Over.

564
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,219
Roger, Nightjar.
Over and out.

565
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,155
I want to go to the pub,
grab some more smokes.

566
00:37:11,605 --> 00:37:13,126
Do you want anything?

567
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,785
A pack of Seniors.

568
00:37:15,885 --> 00:37:17,405
There you go, sir.

569
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,471
Two packets of Rothmans,

570
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:21,726
Two Senior Service and 8 bags of crisps.

571
00:37:21,826 --> 00:37:22,534
Okay.

572
00:37:22,684 --> 00:37:25,294
Hello, gorgeous.
Are we still on track?

573
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,278
We had a scare last night.
The cops came round.

574
00:37:28,378 --> 00:37:30,510
Can't you pull rank and make
sure it doesn't happen again?

575
00:37:30,611 --> 00:37:33,825
No, we can't show our hand.
We're invisible, remember?

576
00:37:33,926 --> 00:37:36,740
- I wish I was.
- How about your friend Terry?

577
00:37:36,841 --> 00:37:39,061
Where is he planning to
carve up the proceeds?

578
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,691
Shit.

579
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,985
- A pint of ale, chief.
- What's wrong?

580
00:37:48,085 --> 00:37:50,092
I needed to take a break.

581
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,226
Who's that you've been talking to?

582
00:37:52,326 --> 00:37:55,087
I wasn't.
He was trying to chat me up.

583
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,254
Does happen, you know.

584
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,987
<i>- Right.
- There you are.</i>

585
00:38:00,087 --> 00:38:02,485
<i>- Cheers. Keep the change.
- Thank you.</i>

586
00:38:02,585 --> 00:38:05,919
Now, what are you doing here?
Are you following me?

587
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,943
No.

588
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,489
- I just wanted a pint.
- Then enjoy it.

589
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,602
- Hello, Gale.
- Where have you been?

590
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,153
You're rather impressed with our
friend Hakim, aren't you?

591
00:38:45,253 --> 00:38:48,551
I know rule #1:
"Don't get emotionally involved"

592
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,532
That doesn't mean I can't
enjoy my work.

593
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,327
You certainly do.

594
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,972
What does your father think of your
consorting with these radicals anyway?

595
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,397
We are not amused.

596
00:39:00,247 --> 00:39:02,127
Of course, if he knew
what I was really up to,

597
00:39:02,227 --> 00:39:03,627
he would have a heart attack.

598
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,307
Here you are.
Credit cards and cash.

599
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,256
If he does have copies of the
photos and negatives there,

600
00:39:10,356 --> 00:39:11,148
they will be hidden.

601
00:39:11,248 --> 00:39:12,832
Find them.
Destroy them.

602
00:39:12,932 --> 00:39:14,745
And then get out.

603
00:39:14,845 --> 00:39:16,748
Michael X thinks he's safe,
tucked away in Trinidad.

604
00:39:16,898 --> 00:39:18,941
That will all change if
we're successful here.

605
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,996
Just remember, Gale:
He's a nasty piece of work.

606
00:39:22,096 --> 00:39:27,058
He's a crazy dope-smoking lunatic
pimp extortionist, that's what he is.

607
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,021
Everything okay, Nightjar?
Anything I need to know?

608
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,137
Yeah, everything's all right, mate.

609
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,636
Listen, what if I want to go
for a pee up here?

610
00:39:37,736 --> 00:39:40,307
<i>I don't know.
Use your imagination.</i>

611
00:39:40,407 --> 00:39:43,730
<i>Stay off the radio unless you
see any Old Bill, all right?</i>

612
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,271
<i>Yeah, all right. If I see any
Old Bill, I'll let you know.</i>

613
00:39:47,871 --> 00:39:49,871
<i>I'll speak to you in a bit.
Over.</i>

614
00:39:57,471 --> 00:39:58,271
Hey Bambas.

615
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:59,903
What's all this brickwork?

616
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,494
I don't know,
it wasn't on the plans.

617
00:40:03,594 --> 00:40:04,594
Fuck!

618
00:40:06,394 --> 00:40:07,894
<i>Terry?
Fucking hell!</i>

619
00:40:09,394 --> 00:40:11,094
<i>Terry!
Bambas!</i>

620
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,672
Terry, talk to me!

621
00:40:15,272 --> 00:40:16,022
Terry!

622
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:17,872
Oh fuck..

623
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,207
<i>Terry, talk to me!</i>

624
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,794
<i>- Are you all right?
- I think so, yeah.</i>

625
00:40:26,895 --> 00:40:28,105
What happened?

626
00:40:29,155 --> 00:40:30,816
<i>The floor just caved in.</i>

627
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,194
Bloody hell, Terry.
Don't do that to me.

628
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,500
- I thought you was a goner.
- Yeah.

629
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:36,743
Give us a light, Dave.

630
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,287
What's down there?

631
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,369
<i>- It's a pile of skeletons.
- You're joking.</i>

632
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,570
<i>Let's hope they're not the last gang
who tried to take this bank.</i>

633
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,348
Latin.
Roughly translated:

634
00:40:55,448 --> 00:40:57,676
Lamb of God,
forgive us our sins.

635
00:40:57,776 --> 00:41:00,718
- How do you know Latin?
- Catholic school.

636
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,144
The Bleeding Heart sisters
of eternal misery.

637
00:41:03,244 --> 00:41:05,353
Interesting date.
1665.

638
00:41:05,453 --> 00:41:06,976
You all know what year
that was, don't you?

639
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,837
The last time West Ham
won the cup?

640
00:41:08,937 --> 00:41:11,193
It was the great plague of London.

641
00:41:11,293 --> 00:41:13,394
This must be a
burial chamber.

642
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,324
A crypt where they dumped the bodies.

643
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,559
Well, if these poor
bastards had the plague,

644
00:41:17,659 --> 00:41:19,109
they could be infectious.

645
00:41:19,209 --> 00:41:20,706
I don't think so, Dave.

646
00:41:20,806 --> 00:41:23,111
This crypt goes all
the way under the bank.

647
00:41:23,211 --> 00:41:24,743
It'll put us in the vault quicker.

648
00:41:24,843 --> 00:41:28,480
And how we'll gonna do that?

649
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,663
Concrete.

650
00:41:45,763 --> 00:41:47,881
Floor of the vault.

651
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,117
Time to get paid for all our work.

652
00:41:50,267 --> 00:41:50,961
Right.

653
00:41:51,062 --> 00:41:53,871
If we hit the restaurant by mistake,
we'll be knee-deep in fried chicken.

654
00:41:54,671 --> 00:41:56,671
I'll be happy if we don't
hit the sewage.

655
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,340
When are you guys
going to hit the vault?

656
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:47,209
<i>I'm freezing my tits off up here.
Over.</i>

657
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,056
<i>In the army, soldiers would pull on</i>

658
00:42:50,206 --> 00:42:52,633
<i>their puds to keep their blood flowing.
Over</i>

659
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,509
What regiment were you in,
the Royal Corps of Wankers?

660
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,097
Over.

661
00:42:57,247 --> 00:43:00,261
<i>Yes, we welcome new members.
Roger, over and out.</i>

662
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,670
<i>Emergency operator.
Which service do you require?</i>

663
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:06,868
<i>- The police, please.
- Putting you through.</i>

664
00:43:06,968 --> 00:43:08,255
<i>Police here.
Can I help you?</i>

665
00:43:08,355 --> 00:43:09,829
Yes.
I'm a HAM radio operator

666
00:43:09,979 --> 00:43:12,806
and I think I may be overhearing
a robbery in progress.

667
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:29,093
We're in!
Dave, get the ladder.

668
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:06,623
We're gonna move into the vault
after we take a break.

669
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,051
We need to let the fumes clear out.

670
00:44:09,201 --> 00:44:11,083
You're having a laugh, ain't you?
Let's go in now.

671
00:44:11,183 --> 00:44:15,316
Dave. Nothing's going nowhere.
I can hardly breathe in there.

672
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:19,438
- Nightjar, are you there? Over.
- Nightjar here, over.

673
00:44:19,539 --> 00:44:21,169
<i>We're in.
Over.</i>

674
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,988
What, in the actual vault?

675
00:44:24,088 --> 00:44:25,629
Yes, in the actual vault. Over.

676
00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:28,990
Great, great.
That's great news. Over.

677
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,498
We're taking a break.
We're knackered.

678
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,820
<i>I need to get some sleep.</i>

679
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,082
<i>Getting some shut-eye while
the fumes clear out. Over.</i>

680
00:44:35,182 --> 00:44:39,460
<i>Lucky you. My eyes are like
organ stops. Over.</i>

681
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:42,056
<i>We can smell the money now.
Over.</i>

682
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:44,862
Look, money may be your god,
but it ain't mine, all right?

683
00:44:44,962 --> 00:44:48,442
I want a warm bath and a cuppa tea.
Over.

684
00:44:48,542 --> 00:44:51,284
You'll get your cup of tea.
Just your odd time.

685
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,466
<i>Lucky you.
My eyes are like organ stops.</i>

686
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:56,822
<i>We can smell the money now.</i>

687
00:44:56,922 --> 00:44:58,782
I rang 4 other police
stations before you,

688
00:44:58,932 --> 00:45:00,348
but nobody took me sriously.

689
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:02,553
....said it was probably a hoax.

690
00:45:02,654 --> 00:45:04,540
How strong was the signal, Mr. Addey?

691
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,675
I'd say they were within
a 10 mile radius.

692
00:45:06,775 --> 00:45:09,684
There must be a ton of
banks in that area.

693
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,680
And when was the last time
you picked them up?

694
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:14,101
They've been quiet for about an hour.

695
00:45:14,201 --> 00:45:16,503
What about releasing the tapes
to the radio and TV?

696
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,297
Maybe somebody can recognize the voices?

697
00:45:18,397 --> 00:45:19,014
No, no.

698
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,792
If they hear themselves,
they'll stop transmitting.

699
00:45:21,892 --> 00:45:23,393
No, we should keep listening.

700
00:45:23,493 --> 00:45:25,384
Maybe they'll reveal where they are.

701
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,953
Alfie, you stay here with Mr. Addey.
I am going back to the station.

702
00:45:28,053 --> 00:45:30,399
You call me if you hear anything.

703
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:30,389
<i>Hi.</i>

704
00:46:34,439 --> 00:46:36,555
You scared the piss out of me.

705
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:42,094
- What are you doing here?
- I couldn't sleep.

706
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:46,382
Yeah, I'm a bit jangly
myself..

707
00:46:46,482 --> 00:46:50,397
I just had to come and have a look.
Our future is in those boxes.

708
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,882
So, what are you going to do
with your share?

709
00:46:57,982 --> 00:47:01,432
Vanish.
Martine Love will cease to exist.

710
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,723
Why, do you think if you
vanish you'll become someone else?

711
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,516
At least no one will know
who I was.

712
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:15,924
Why did you pick Kevin and me?
You could have found better thieves.

713
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,936
For old times' sake.

714
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,940
Must be old times
you spent with Kevin,

715
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:24,885
not me.

716
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,397
Kevin has it in his mind that
we had this passionate affair.

717
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:29,934
The truth is, it came down

718
00:47:30,084 --> 00:47:32,598
to 4 chinese meals and
a roll in the hay.

719
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,827
And that was a long time ago.

720
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:18,558
All right,

721
00:48:18,658 --> 00:48:20,158
let's make some money.

722
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,343
Look at this!

723
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,707
Look at all this cash.

724
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:45,952
Fantastic!

725
00:48:46,052 --> 00:48:47,452
Guys? Gold bars.

726
00:48:47,852 --> 00:48:49,252
Diamonds. Diamonds!

727
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,632
Guys, what's going on?

728
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:03,812
How would your wife fancy a tiara?

729
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,156
Too bloody right.

730
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:09,899
<i>Get the gas.
The gas.</i>

731
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,606
<i>Look at it.
Hold it.</i>

732
00:49:11,706 --> 00:49:13,706
- Emerald.
- It's like winning the Pools.

733
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:29,587
Dave.
Give us a hand with this one.

734
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,928
- What's so special about this box?
- It's my lucky number.

735
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,470
All yours, me lovely.

736
00:49:42,570 --> 00:49:44,570
- There you are.
- Cheers.

737
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,961
Holy shit.
You know who that is?

738
00:50:09,062 --> 00:50:10,903
It's Princess Margaret.

739
00:50:11,003 --> 00:50:13,857
Terry, anything for the
widows and auctions funds?

740
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:18,586
- Will that do?
- God bless you, you're very generous.

741
00:50:18,686 --> 00:50:20,552
Look, we have to have
some sort of system.

742
00:50:20,653 --> 00:50:22,449
You don't know what you are throwing
or what you are keeping.

743
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:23,844
Yeah, but we know what money looks like.

744
00:50:23,945 --> 00:50:26,075
We're not throwing that away, are we?

745
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:36,896
How long does it take
to rob a bank?

746
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:41,204
<i>We're just about to end
this job now, yeah?</i>

747
00:50:41,354 --> 00:50:42,116
Not yet.

748
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:44,685
Have a look at this.

749
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,024
No, nothing.

750
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:03,172
Still nothing.

751
00:51:03,272 --> 00:51:04,551
Sergeant, what we need is something

752
00:51:04,651 --> 00:51:06,272
that will motivate the
robbers to go on air,

753
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:09,296
<i>- give away their location.
- Right..</i>

754
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,296
Bait to lure the fish.

755
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,154
No, they are not there,
not transmitting.

756
00:51:17,254 --> 00:51:18,616
They are not there, sir.

757
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:22,406
Move to the next bank,
 Sierra Lima 2.

758
00:51:29,736 --> 00:51:31,728
We still get nothing, Sarge.

759
00:51:32,816 --> 00:51:35,664
Ok, unit Sierra Lima 2, move to the
next location.

760
00:51:37,657 --> 00:51:40,616
My God, the stuff that
some people collect...

761
00:51:41,697 --> 00:51:43,180
What have you got there, Terry?

762
00:51:43,331 --> 00:51:44,785
- '47.
- '47?

763
00:51:45,057 --> 00:51:46,856
Sounds like a good year to me.

764
00:51:49,298 --> 00:51:50,927
Will you pass it round?

765
00:51:51,027 --> 00:51:52,885
Come on, Terry.
Give us some.

766
00:51:53,685 --> 00:51:54,685
Got it.

767
00:52:04,389 --> 00:52:05,389
Catch!

768
00:52:05,489 --> 00:52:06,851
Oi! Yeah...

769
00:52:07,402 --> 00:52:08,490
Here, Major.

770
00:52:08,599 --> 00:52:09,254
Get it down.

771
00:52:09,354 --> 00:52:10,548
<i>Listen fellows, they are onto you.</i>

772
00:52:11,019 --> 00:52:13,527
<i>Listen, they're onto you.
- Fuck.</i>

773
00:52:13,627 --> 00:52:15,275
Coppers are on your doorstep.

774
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:22,324
Speak to me, Nightjar.

775
00:52:22,424 --> 00:52:23,927
<i>Coppers right on your doorstep.</i>

776
00:52:24,027 --> 00:52:26,043
Listen. Hang on, hang on...
they're not going in,

777
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:28,280
<i>but they are not going away.
Wait, wait.</i>

778
00:52:28,381 --> 00:52:30,782
Sergeant, we just heard
the thieves' lookout

779
00:52:30,882 --> 00:52:33,209
say that there are police
outside the bank right now.

780
00:52:33,309 --> 00:52:35,394
- Which bank?
- I haven't got a clue.

781
00:52:35,501 --> 00:52:37,615
We've got patrols outside half
the banks in the West End.

782
00:52:37,715 --> 00:52:40,501
Keep listening, we need to
pinpoint exactly where they are.

783
00:52:42,021 --> 00:52:43,552
<i>Wait. Hang on.</i>

784
00:52:47,982 --> 00:52:51,691
Guys, a black car just pulled up
with some bloke.

785
00:52:51,982 --> 00:52:54,418
He's going up to the front door
with the cops.

786
00:52:57,462 --> 00:52:59,681
Guys, he is unlocking the front door.

787
00:53:00,782 --> 00:53:03,663
They are going in.
Shit! Over.

788
00:53:04,743 --> 00:53:07,680
Oh no.
Shit.

789
00:53:09,023 --> 00:53:11,335
- Where is the vault?
- Downstairs.

790
00:53:16,664 --> 00:53:17,863
Follow me.

791
00:53:38,746 --> 00:53:39,735
Looks fine.

792
00:53:40,235 --> 00:53:42,236
<i>Are you sure everything is all right?
Yes, yes, it is.</i>

793
00:53:43,266 --> 00:53:45,491
- I want to look inside.
- Tell the timelock.

794
00:53:45,591 --> 00:53:47,898
Can't be opened until
tomorrow morning.

795
00:53:50,107 --> 00:53:52,908
Well, it isn't my bank
that's being robbed.

796
00:53:57,209 --> 00:53:59,210
Sorry for calling you
on a Sunday morning, sir.

797
00:53:59,810 --> 00:54:01,811
- Not a problem...
- Thank you.

798
00:54:04,268 --> 00:54:06,863
Fellows, I think they are going away.

799
00:54:13,869 --> 00:54:15,031
They are gone.

800
00:54:23,509 --> 00:54:26,016
We should get out of here.
They could be coming back.

801
00:54:26,116 --> 00:54:28,069
Yeah, right.
We need to let Eddie know.

802
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:29,969
Nightjar?

803
00:54:32,430 --> 00:54:34,232
<i>Nightjar?</i>

804
00:54:34,333 --> 00:54:35,672
No!

805
00:54:35,790 --> 00:54:37,696
Fuck!

806
00:54:37,796 --> 00:54:39,941
Shit.
Fuck.

807
00:54:40,041 --> 00:54:41,793
Shit. Shit.

808
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:44,370
Are you there, Nightjar?

809
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:49,597
The ambulance reports it's outside
the Lloyd's bank on Baker Street.

810
00:54:49,697 --> 00:54:51,352
Nightjar, can you hear me?

811
00:54:53,231 --> 00:54:55,329
<i>You gone to sleep, Nightjar?</i>

812
00:54:57,529 --> 00:54:59,530
Fucking hell...

813
00:55:04,752 --> 00:55:06,126
Nightjar, are you there?

814
00:55:06,232 --> 00:55:08,579
Look, if he's not picking up,
something is wrong.

815
00:55:08,879 --> 00:55:09,866
You're right.

816
00:55:09,966 --> 00:55:11,242
So, grab all the cash and the jewels

817
00:55:11,392 --> 00:55:12,350
and get the fuck out of here.

818
00:55:12,452 --> 00:55:13,423
What about our gear?

819
00:55:13,573 --> 00:55:14,901
We cant leave anything
that might incriminate us.

820
00:55:15,001 --> 00:55:15,910
We come back for it if we can.

821
00:55:16,010 --> 00:55:16,947
What about all the other boxes?

822
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:19,402
Doesn't matter, Dave.
Put everything in a bag and lets go!

823
00:55:19,514 --> 00:55:21,373
All right, let's move it.
Come on!

824
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:27,729
- There's nothing here, Sarge.
- Are you sure?

825
00:55:27,833 --> 00:55:29,991
There's no mention of the ambulance.

826
00:55:30,091 --> 00:55:32,430
Nothing.
Move on, Sierra Lima 2.

827
00:55:45,475 --> 00:55:46,584
- Let's go!
- Finally.

828
00:55:46,684 --> 00:55:47,793
Come on, let's go.

829
00:55:49,756 --> 00:55:52,140
The van is leaving.
We will follow them. Over.

830
00:55:52,239 --> 00:55:54,272
Stop them as soon as possible.

831
00:56:05,317 --> 00:56:06,765
Open the door!

832
00:56:07,637 --> 00:56:10,277
- What have I done, guv'nor?
- Open the back door, come on.

833
00:56:10,957 --> 00:56:13,182
Some fella paid me 50 quid
to pick up his van

834
00:56:13,283 --> 00:56:15,067
and drop it at Heathrow airport.

835
00:56:17,478 --> 00:56:19,311
Jesus Christ...

836
00:56:20,518 --> 00:56:22,350
- Wher's the van?
- Change of plan.

837
00:56:22,449 --> 00:56:23,934
Precautionary measure.

838
00:56:24,384 --> 00:56:26,408
I've organised alternative transport.

839
00:56:26,518 --> 00:56:28,922
- Why?
- None of us have met your boyfriend.

840
00:56:29,022 --> 00:56:31,367
He's all go to include
you on the back of the job.

841
00:56:31,959 --> 00:56:33,978
Could've set us up.

842
00:56:38,639 --> 00:56:40,024
We bloody well pulled it off.

843
00:56:40,124 --> 00:56:42,146
Done with military
precision, hey, major?

844
00:56:42,246 --> 00:56:43,478
Now that I am fiscally secure,

845
00:56:43,578 --> 00:56:45,279
I think I'll promote
myself to "Colonel".

846
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:48,347
<i>You know what I am going to do?</i>

847
00:56:48,447 --> 00:56:50,867
I'm going to buy my mom a new house.
Something with a garden.

848
00:56:50,967 --> 00:56:52,769
I thought you would be off
to Copenhagen, Dave?

849
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:56,653
- Why would I go to Copenhagen?
- Heavy cock, sure hunt.

850
00:56:57,060 --> 00:56:58,403
You know what I'll do?
I'll chop off one more

851
00:56:58,853 --> 00:57:00,878
and then I got one like
your little pinkey.

852
00:57:26,803 --> 00:57:28,636
How did you find this place
then, Terry?

853
00:57:29,723 --> 00:57:30,670
A bloke and I used to run a...

854
00:57:30,770 --> 00:57:32,150
chop shop here.

855
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:33,653
He's in the nick now.

856
00:57:33,763 --> 00:57:36,112
How could you lose control
of the operation?

857
00:57:36,883 --> 00:57:38,404
I thought you were
on top of this thing.

858
00:57:38,554 --> 00:57:39,613
Sir, it worked.

859
00:57:39,723 --> 00:57:41,199
They did the job.
They robbed the vault.

860
00:57:41,299 --> 00:57:43,874
And we have no idea
where the fuck they are.

861
00:57:44,764 --> 00:57:46,829
You know, an ugly thought
has just occured.

862
00:57:46,929 --> 00:57:49,382
Lots of money in that vault,
juwelry, bonds.

863
00:57:49,485 --> 00:57:52,268
You and your sweetie haven't
cooked up something between you, I hope.

864
00:57:52,368 --> 00:57:54,233
- You think I'd betray you?
- There are precedents.

865
00:57:54,333 --> 00:57:56,923
Two of our former colleagues
now live in bloody Moscow.

866
00:57:57,023 --> 00:57:58,654
Let's hope they don't have
another bidder.

867
00:57:58,765 --> 00:58:00,921
She won't cross us.
She knows what we're capable of.

868
00:58:01,021 --> 00:58:03,523
How does she even know
who the hell we are?

869
00:58:03,625 --> 00:58:06,413
I'm sure she will contact me
when she comes to her senses.

870
00:58:06,685 --> 00:58:09,070
Going anywhere else would be
a death sentence.

871
00:58:09,170 --> 00:58:11,103
You better hope she does, Everett.

872
00:58:11,806 --> 00:58:13,586
Or it may be yours.

873
00:58:24,087 --> 00:58:26,538
Here you go, Bambas.
That's your lot.

874
00:58:28,408 --> 00:58:32,004
"Never washed after our
magic moment. Snookie."

875
00:58:38,008 --> 00:58:40,967
Hey, Dave.
Look at this.

876
00:58:43,008 --> 00:58:46,793
I've seen this bloke on the TV.
The old perv.

877
00:58:46,893 --> 00:58:50,114
I have seen this face before.
He's an M.P..

878
00:58:50,214 --> 00:58:53,254
Lord... whatshisname, you know.
Always wears those poncey bow ties.

879
00:58:53,354 --> 00:58:55,216
Well, on that picture he's not.

880
00:58:56,009 --> 00:58:57,743
I believe this is one
of your old movies, Dave.

881
00:58:58,249 --> 00:58:59,746
Piss off, Kev.

882
00:59:00,029 --> 00:59:01,476
Timely suggestion.

883
00:59:01,626 --> 00:59:04,618
I believe I'll take my share
and be on my way,

884
00:59:05,730 --> 00:59:07,162
before the bank opens in the morning

885
00:59:07,313 --> 00:59:08,538
and the shit hits the
proverbial fan.

886
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:09,484
I'm with you, Guy.

887
00:59:09,584 --> 00:59:10,865
I don't have to remind you:

888
00:59:10,971 --> 00:59:13,920
Keep a low profile.
No buying Aston Martins, Bambas.

889
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:17,230
The only thing I'm buying is a
one-way ticket back to Cyprus.

890
00:59:17,331 --> 00:59:19,696
- I'm never coming back.
- We should have a reunion.

891
00:59:19,795 --> 00:59:23,947
- 20 years, the Savoy Grill.
- Yeah, right, maybe for you, Guy.

892
00:59:24,571 --> 00:59:26,933
I still wouldn't let us lot in.

893
00:59:28,171 --> 00:59:29,524
- Bambas.
- Goodbye my friend.

894
00:59:29,774 --> 00:59:31,341
Take care of yourself, mate.

895
00:59:32,041 --> 00:59:33,041
Major.

896
00:59:37,933 --> 00:59:39,517
Be lucky.

897
00:59:39,712 --> 00:59:40,932
Bambas.

898
00:59:41,832 --> 00:59:43,333
Goodbye, old chap.

899
00:59:49,714 --> 00:59:51,489
Okay, what's going on?
You two have been staring

900
00:59:51,593 --> 00:59:53,290
daggers at each other
since we left the bank

901
00:59:54,054 --> 00:59:56,512
What is it?
Lover's tiff?

902
01:00:02,894 --> 01:00:05,047
I think Martine has got
something to tell us.

903
01:00:09,655 --> 01:00:11,914
Hang about.
That's Princess Margaret.

904
01:00:12,114 --> 01:00:13,415
Fuck me...

905
01:00:17,455 --> 01:00:18,685
Where do these come from?

906
01:00:18,785 --> 01:00:21,412
You knew the exact
box this stuff was in, Martine.

907
01:00:21,895 --> 01:00:24,854
You'd better come clean and tell us
what this is really about.

908
01:00:27,416 --> 01:00:31,361
About a month ago I got busted at
Heathrow on a drug charge.

909
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:34,267
This guy I know said he would fix it
to keep me out of jail,

910
01:00:34,377 --> 01:00:36,539
if I do him a favour.

911
01:00:36,639 --> 01:00:38,086
He knew I knew some villains.

912
01:00:38,186 --> 01:00:40,894
He wanted to set up a robbery
to get these.

913
01:00:41,417 --> 01:00:42,746
Fucking hell!

914
01:00:42,846 --> 01:00:44,847
That would be the bloke
you met in the Player's Club.

915
01:00:45,617 --> 01:00:48,314
Same guy you said was trying
to pick you up in The Globe, right?

916
01:00:48,417 --> 01:00:50,016
- Yeah.
- Well, so who is he?

917
01:00:50,116 --> 01:00:52,285
He's a guy I met at the Sombrero Club.

918
01:00:52,385 --> 01:00:54,685
He works for some shady outfit
in Whitehall.

919
01:00:54,785 --> 01:00:57,575
- Oh no, no. You mean MI fucking 5?
- Or 6?

920
01:00:58,258 --> 01:01:00,216
We could get seriously
nicked here, Martine!

921
01:01:00,516 --> 01:01:01,417
No, we couldn't.

922
01:01:01,517 --> 01:01:03,759
All Tim wants is the contents
of box 118.

923
01:01:03,859 --> 01:01:06,931
The deal with him is,
we get to keep everything else.

924
01:01:07,899 --> 01:01:09,469
And you believe that?

925
01:01:09,579 --> 01:01:12,126
You put your trust in some prick
we've never even met.

926
01:01:12,225 --> 01:01:13,426
You lied to us, Martine!

927
01:01:13,576 --> 01:01:15,189
We were sitting ducks
right from ther start.

928
01:01:15,459 --> 01:01:16,493
Thank you very much.

929
01:01:16,593 --> 01:01:19,020
You think it's a coincidence
that you get busted for drugs

930
01:01:19,301 --> 01:01:21,428
and your Tim just happens to have
a plan to rob a bank?

931
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:23,203
This can work out.

932
01:01:23,302 --> 01:01:25,457
We give him the photos and
everything else in that box

933
01:01:25,557 --> 01:01:27,409
and we get to keep the rest
and we're free and clear.

934
01:01:27,508 --> 01:01:29,265
These people are regular cozzers
, Martine.

935
01:01:29,364 --> 01:01:30,447
They are above that.

936
01:01:30,597 --> 01:01:31,737
They do things coppers can't.

937
01:01:31,941 --> 01:01:35,559
They think we've seen these photos,
we're expendable as dog shit.

938
01:01:35,741 --> 01:01:37,099
You know what?

939
01:01:37,199 --> 01:01:38,650
I've seen our shots
and I  know...

940
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:41,351
we're either dog shit
or about to be dog shit.

941
01:01:41,622 --> 01:01:42,815
I'm out of here.

942
01:01:42,941 --> 01:01:46,498
I'm not waiting for a load of spooks
and coppers to come cracking my head.

943
01:01:46,598 --> 01:01:47,726
I'm splitting like Guy and Bambas.

944
01:01:47,826 --> 01:01:49,366
It would be better if we
stuck together, Dave.

945
01:01:49,466 --> 01:01:53,015
And why, Tel?, 'cause we've been so
truthful with each other so far?

946
01:01:54,023 --> 01:01:57,151
- Dave, come on...
- No, I'm going home, Kev. See me mom.

947
01:01:57,263 --> 01:02:00,345
And then I'm going far away, as far
as I can get away from you.

948
01:02:05,264 --> 01:02:09,128
We'd better get out of here, too.
In case Guy and Bambas get picked up.

949
01:02:09,228 --> 01:02:10,884
Let's split the lot of this.

950
01:02:10,984 --> 01:02:13,776
There may be someone else in this shit
to cause us some more grief.

951
01:02:18,544 --> 01:02:21,320
- One of those, mate.
- Here you go.

952
01:02:21,984 --> 01:02:23,853
- Keep the change.
- Thanks.

953
01:02:31,185 --> 01:02:34,205
- They overheard our radio chat.
- Fuckin' hell...

954
01:02:38,146 --> 01:02:41,400
"Police last night were trying to home in
on a £300.000 bank raid."

955
01:02:41,506 --> 01:02:43,130
They still don't know
what bank it was.

956
01:02:43,229 --> 01:02:45,622
- 300 grand?
- It's a bit more than that...

957
01:02:45,722 --> 01:02:46,972
More like 3 million.

958
01:03:19,268 --> 01:03:20,884
- Hello?
- Martine Love.

959
01:03:20,989 --> 01:03:24,135
Thank God.
Put her through and then run a trace.

960
01:03:24,235 --> 01:03:25,551
<i>It's me.</i>

961
01:03:25,730 --> 01:03:27,455
What happened?
Where the hell are you?

962
01:03:27,555 --> 01:03:28,130
London.

963
01:03:28,230 --> 01:03:29,731
I know, of course.
I mean, where?

964
01:03:29,831 --> 01:03:30,655
I know what you mean.

965
01:03:30,755 --> 01:03:31,821
Martine, we have to meet.

966
01:03:31,921 --> 01:03:34,185
I agree.
Why don't you come over to my place?

967
01:03:34,386 --> 01:03:35,786
I'll make you a cocktail,

968
01:03:35,886 --> 01:03:38,135
and we'll have a roll in the hay
for old times' sake.

969
01:03:38,235 --> 01:03:41,530
Oh, right. You would have
been there, haven't you?

970
01:03:41,631 --> 01:03:43,910
Probably have your men
keeping lookout for me now.

971
01:03:44,010 --> 01:03:46,099
You're not in a position
to play games, Martine.

972
01:03:46,198 --> 01:03:48,336
No threats please, Tim.

973
01:03:48,436 --> 01:03:51,243
Why didn't you tell me what
it was I was set up to get you?

974
01:03:51,431 --> 01:03:52,796
For your own good.

975
01:03:52,896 --> 01:03:54,438
I care about your safety, Martine.

976
01:03:54,631 --> 01:03:56,087
Right.

977
01:03:57,512 --> 01:04:00,338
I suppose I give you what you
want and we go our separate ways.

978
01:04:00,438 --> 01:04:01,839
That's what I promised.

979
01:04:01,938 --> 01:04:04,406
Ok, today. Tottenham Court Road Tube.

980
01:04:04,793 --> 01:04:07,577
Northern isle, northbound platform.
10:30 sharp.

981
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:10,739
Tottenham Court Road, 10:30.
Good.

982
01:04:10,839 --> 01:04:15,225
"London vaults checked after radio HAM
tunes in to a crime."

983
01:04:15,473 --> 01:04:18,385
Christ, what a fiasco!

984
01:04:18,673 --> 01:04:20,478
And now the particular
bank has been identified,

985
01:04:20,578 --> 01:04:22,241
the story will be all over the news.

986
01:04:22,342 --> 01:04:24,087
We've heard it already is.

987
01:04:25,834 --> 01:04:27,899
If we don't get onto the case quickly

988
01:04:27,999 --> 01:04:29,421
the police will have nabbed
these robbers,

989
01:04:29,521 --> 01:04:31,522
and God knows what will happen to
our photographs.

990
01:04:32,222 --> 01:04:34,259
Philip, get over to the bank.

991
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:36,448
Take control of the situation.

992
01:04:37,034 --> 01:04:41,449
Gentlemen. I've just had
a conversation with one Martine Love.

993
01:04:41,555 --> 01:04:42,950
Where is she?

994
01:04:43,050 --> 01:04:45,499
Call was traced to a public phone box
in Earl's Court.

995
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:47,422
Good news is,
she's arranged a meet.

996
01:04:47,521 --> 01:04:48,559
That is good news.

997
01:04:48,659 --> 01:04:50,169
- I'll be better off going alone.
- Yeah.

998
01:04:51,556 --> 01:04:53,583
Tim has agreed to meet.

999
01:04:53,682 --> 01:04:56,896
It's all over the news.
They found the location of the bank.

1000
01:04:57,956 --> 01:04:59,334
So what?

1001
01:05:04,317 --> 01:05:05,731
Keep the change.

1002
01:05:07,957 --> 01:05:09,116
I'm sorry, ma'am,
you can't go in.

1003
01:05:09,216 --> 01:05:10,122
There's been a robbery.

1004
01:05:10,222 --> 01:05:12,389
We know there's been a robbery,
that's why we're all here.

1005
01:05:25,294 --> 01:05:27,894
<i>Everybody that works here.
I need everybody. Speak to him.</i>

1006
01:05:28,719 --> 01:05:30,266
Gerald?

1007
01:05:30,759 --> 01:05:32,946
You work in robbery now then?

1008
01:05:33,046 --> 01:05:34,687
You're a long way off your patch.

1009
01:05:34,787 --> 01:05:36,282
Regional crime squad now.

1010
01:05:36,382 --> 01:05:38,507
Just went by to see
what all the fuss is about.

1011
01:05:38,607 --> 01:05:40,556
Pretty cheeky, that radio bit.

1012
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:44,037
These walkie-talkie robbers
certainly caught your lot on the hop.

1013
01:05:44,137 --> 01:05:45,705
Makes us all look stupid.

1014
01:05:45,805 --> 01:05:46,599
Yeah, well...

1015
01:05:46,849 --> 01:05:49,048
You're pretty chummy with all
the villains around town.

1016
01:05:49,441 --> 01:05:51,628
You got any idea who
could have done this?

1017
01:05:51,727 --> 01:05:53,492
None of my informants.

1018
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:56,830
We have been waiting here
quite some time,

1019
01:05:57,021 --> 01:05:59,107
and so far you people have
told us absolutely nothing.

1020
01:05:59,206 --> 01:06:01,105
If you would like to give us an
itemized list

1021
01:06:01,204 --> 01:06:03,424
of the content of your boxes,
we may be able to ascertain...

1022
01:06:03,524 --> 01:06:04,849
- Are you mad?
- ...what's missing.

1023
01:06:04,948 --> 01:06:06,408
The whole point in having
a safe deposit box

1024
01:06:06,801 --> 01:06:09,549
is so that people like you
don't know what's in it!

1025
01:06:11,002 --> 01:06:13,269
I want to speak to a Roy Given.

1026
01:06:13,370 --> 01:06:14,408
Yeah, that's me.

1027
01:06:14,508 --> 01:06:16,540
This robbery is now a matter of
national security.

1028
01:06:16,690 --> 01:06:17,970
I want everybody out.

1029
01:06:18,070 --> 01:06:19,529
This is a police investigation.

1030
01:06:19,629 --> 01:06:22,484
Not anymore.
Call your superiors.

1031
01:06:24,003 --> 01:06:25,833
Who the bloody hell does he think he is?

1032
01:06:26,323 --> 01:06:30,032
Spooks. MI-5 or 6,
I can never tell the difference.

1033
01:06:30,323 --> 01:06:31,518
They all got the same tailor

1034
01:06:31,618 --> 01:06:33,714
and they all went to
the same bloody school.

1035
01:06:34,203 --> 01:06:35,579
Let's get some copies of the...

1036
01:06:35,679 --> 01:06:37,514
walkie-talkie tapes
out to the news boys.

1037
01:06:38,004 --> 01:06:40,814
Maybe the public can help
identify the villains.

1038
01:06:41,804 --> 01:06:44,994
So tell me... Which of the boxes
were ransacked?

1039
01:06:45,284 --> 01:06:48,684
The lot.
100s through to 400s.

1040
01:06:51,005 --> 01:06:53,752
Oh, well we're in a crapper, Jerry.
Both of us.

1041
01:06:53,852 --> 01:06:55,810
Both?
Now, why is it my problem?

1042
01:06:55,910 --> 01:06:58,500
Accounts have to be balanced
records kept.

1043
01:06:58,686 --> 01:07:01,512
And I wouldn't likely keep the books
around here, now would I?

1044
01:07:01,612 --> 01:07:04,061
Spell it out, Lew.
Be more specific.

1045
01:07:05,046 --> 01:07:06,559
I have a ledger,

1046
01:07:07,446 --> 01:07:08,835
a record of every payment

1047
01:07:09,085 --> 01:07:10,836
I've ever made to you
and your colleagues.

1048
01:07:10,936 --> 01:07:13,201
It was in my safety deposit box,

1049
01:07:13,447 --> 01:07:14,991
and I think we can safely assume...

1050
01:07:15,091 --> 01:07:16,954
it's now in the possession
of the robbers.

1051
01:07:17,054 --> 01:07:18,775
Jesus wept.

1052
01:07:18,886 --> 01:07:19,943
And I think you'll agree

1053
01:07:20,043 --> 01:07:22,678
we have to find those villains
before your honest colleagues do.

1054
01:07:22,847 --> 01:07:24,122
For fuck's sake.

1055
01:07:31,207 --> 01:07:32,594
Who is this?

1056
01:07:32,694 --> 01:07:34,151
<i>Lew Vogel.</i>

1057
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:35,957
Hold on.
Get up.

1058
01:07:36,248 --> 01:07:37,887
Come on, wake up.

1059
01:07:40,529 --> 01:07:42,062
What do you want, Lew?

1060
01:07:43,048 --> 01:07:46,077
<i>I'm afraid I've got some
potentially bad news for you, Michael.</i>

1061
01:07:46,176 --> 01:07:49,438
Your safety deposit box at
the Baker Street bank...

1062
01:07:49,538 --> 01:07:51,073
what's its number?

1063
01:07:51,173 --> 01:07:52,354
Why do you ask?

1064
01:07:52,454 --> 01:07:54,599
<i>Well, because some thieves broke into
the bank vault and robbed it.</i>

1065
01:07:56,090 --> 01:07:57,945
So if your box is in the
100 to 400 numbers,

1066
01:07:58,045 --> 01:07:59,838
I'm afraid all your stuff
will be gone.

1067
01:07:59,938 --> 01:08:01,393
<i>Mine too, unhappily.</i>

1068
01:08:01,493 --> 01:08:03,114
What? How can this happen in London?

1069
01:08:03,213 --> 01:08:04,816
<i>Well, I promise you it has happened.</i>

1070
01:08:04,916 --> 01:08:07,345
I promise you these thieves will be
found and dealt with.

1071
01:08:07,731 --> 01:08:10,335
<i>You can rely on it.
I'll keep you informed.</i>

1072
01:08:10,435 --> 01:08:11,730
Thank you.

1073
01:09:15,735 --> 01:09:18,040
No-one touches me, follows me
or Martine takes your stuff...

1074
01:09:18,141 --> 01:09:21,014
right to Fleet Street, understood?

1075
01:09:26,576 --> 01:09:28,802
You want box 118, Tim.

1076
01:09:28,902 --> 01:09:31,484
You have no idea of the danger
you and your chums are in, do you?

1077
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:33,542
Is that right?
And what would that be?

1078
01:09:33,642 --> 01:09:36,032
You've opened Pandora's box,
you dumb prick, that's why.

1079
01:09:36,317 --> 01:09:37,795
I know what's at stake.

1080
01:09:37,977 --> 01:09:39,580
And I know how expendable we are.

1081
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:40,833
Some change in the deal.

1082
01:09:40,938 --> 01:09:42,455
- Oh, is that right?
- Yeah...

1083
01:09:42,555 --> 01:09:46,322
You'll get all your nasty pictures,
but here's the twist:

1084
01:09:46,422 --> 01:09:49,925
We'll get indemnity, fresh passports,
safe passage out of the country.

1085
01:09:50,026 --> 01:09:51,315
For the whole team.

1086
01:09:51,418 --> 01:09:52,824
And an officially signed document

1087
01:09:52,974 --> 01:09:55,415
guaranteeing we won't be prosecuted
and we won't be pursued.

1088
01:09:55,579 --> 01:09:57,366
You can't be serious?

1089
01:09:57,467 --> 01:09:59,233
You can bet your bollocks I'm serious.

1090
01:09:59,339 --> 01:10:01,661
I want it signed and delivered
by a public figure

1091
01:10:01,761 --> 01:10:03,479
of substantial authority.

1092
01:10:03,579 --> 01:10:04,845
How about the Prime Minister?

1093
01:10:04,945 --> 01:10:07,214
Yeah, he'll do, if you
can drag him off his yacht.

1094
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:09,371
You mess with us, Tim...

1095
01:10:10,860 --> 01:10:13,655
We can drip-feed pictures like this
to the press.

1096
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:20,358
We've got a stack of 'em.

1097
01:10:21,540 --> 01:10:22,894
Oh, do you?

1098
01:10:25,140 --> 01:10:27,808
You've got until 4pm to confirm
that we have a deal.

1099
01:10:28,101 --> 01:10:29,599
We'll be in touch.

1100
01:10:34,302 --> 01:10:35,857
Some photographs.

1101
01:10:36,341 --> 01:10:37,895
Well done, Tim!

1102
01:10:50,743 --> 01:10:52,090
Do you have any more?

1103
01:10:52,190 --> 01:10:55,823
Apparently there is a whole rogues gallery
stored in one of those boxes.

1104
01:11:02,983 --> 01:11:05,151
If Lord Drysdale is up to his usual
hanky-panky,

1105
01:11:05,251 --> 01:11:06,651
that's his problem.

1106
01:11:07,352 --> 01:11:10,410
This operation is about recovering
the photos from Michael X.

1107
01:11:10,510 --> 01:11:12,613
Might it not be prudent
to get the committee

1108
01:11:12,804 --> 01:11:13,891
to consider issuing a "D notice"?

1109
01:11:15,556 --> 01:11:17,057
To protect everyone potentially

1110
01:11:17,165 --> 01:11:19,146
embarrassed by this
criminal activity.

1111
01:11:19,345 --> 01:11:21,696
...Which we instigated.

1112
01:11:24,997 --> 01:11:26,998
<i>Very nice.
Very nice indeed.</i>

1113
01:11:29,586 --> 01:11:33,173
When I came out there were a
couple of lads taking some photos.

1114
01:11:33,274 --> 01:11:34,677
Buddies of him.

1115
01:11:34,866 --> 01:11:38,541
He was standing right outside the bank
just a few days before it was robbed.

1116
01:11:39,226 --> 01:11:41,616
I thought at the time
he looked a bit shifty.

1117
01:11:45,227 --> 01:11:47,139
Christ, is that thing real?

1118
01:11:48,227 --> 01:11:49,214
I've got it.

1119
01:11:49,365 --> 01:11:51,837
Dave Shilling.
That's his name.

1120
01:11:53,787 --> 01:11:54,930
Tata, mom.

1121
01:11:55,031 --> 01:11:56,983
Look after yourself, son.

1122
01:11:57,467 --> 01:12:00,426
Go, get yourself inside.
You'll catch your death.

1123
01:12:05,708 --> 01:12:08,413
- Dave Shilling?
- Yeah?

1124
01:12:08,513 --> 01:12:10,343
I wonder if we could have a word.

1125
01:12:11,329 --> 01:12:14,045
- About what?
- About a bank.

1126
01:12:20,589 --> 01:12:22,122
I want to tell you something,
Mr. Shilling,

1127
01:12:22,222 --> 01:12:23,623
because it will save time.

1128
01:12:24,623 --> 01:12:25,624
You see,

1129
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:28,587
I have a very jaundiced
view of life.

1130
01:12:29,670 --> 01:12:32,777
From what I see, most of it
is corrupt, venal and vile.

1131
01:12:33,870 --> 01:12:35,474
And I am just saying this
so that you know

1132
01:12:35,575 --> 01:12:37,516
that I don't have a
better nature to appeal to,

1133
01:12:37,616 --> 01:12:40,656
or a compassionate streak.
I mean, you do understand, don't you?

1134
01:12:40,756 --> 01:12:42,337
I think so, Mr. Vogel.

1135
01:12:42,437 --> 01:12:43,706
Good.

1136
01:12:47,072 --> 01:12:48,858
I have a kidney stone,

1137
01:12:48,958 --> 01:12:52,261
I dont  seem to be able
to pass. I'm on painkillers.

1138
01:12:52,912 --> 01:12:55,108
I could use a couple of those myself.

1139
01:13:01,433 --> 01:13:03,188
You stole from me

1140
01:13:04,539 --> 01:13:06,432
and from friends of mine.

1141
01:13:08,633 --> 01:13:11,348
- Where is my stuff?
- I don't know.

1142
01:13:11,448 --> 01:13:14,413
Look, I don't know anything about
any bank robbery. Honest.

1143
01:13:14,513 --> 01:13:17,111
You're still an unconvincing actor,
Mr. Shilling.

1144
01:13:25,875 --> 01:13:28,555
I would love to say
this is not going to hurt,

1145
01:13:28,855 --> 01:13:30,150
but it is.

1146
01:13:40,075 --> 01:13:41,857
What are you going to do?

1147
01:13:41,975 --> 01:13:43,965
Please, no!
No.

1148
01:13:44,995 --> 01:13:47,322
Stop. Please.

1149
01:13:47,422 --> 01:13:48,220
No.

1150
01:13:55,317 --> 01:13:58,307
- Well, they were here.
- What are you gonna do?

1151
01:14:01,116 --> 01:14:02,736
Why is the door open?

1152
01:14:08,158 --> 01:14:09,823
Who are you?

1153
01:14:09,923 --> 01:14:11,736
I could ask the same thing.

1154
01:14:12,438 --> 01:14:13,943
You better run along, eh?

1155
01:14:15,068 --> 01:14:16,253
Get yourselves a
cup of tea or something.

1156
01:14:26,679 --> 01:14:28,419
We are looking for Terry Leather.

1157
01:14:28,519 --> 01:14:29,951
Terry said he would not
be coming in this week.

1158
01:14:30,051 --> 01:14:31,678
He is supposed to call in.

1159
01:14:32,839 --> 01:14:35,910
- So you would be Eddie, right?
- Uh, yeah?

1160
01:14:36,011 --> 01:14:37,260
Well, you're coming with me!

1161
01:14:37,361 --> 01:14:38,337
What are you doing?
Leave him alone!

1162
01:14:38,887 --> 01:14:40,229
What are you going
to do with my Eddie?

1163
01:14:40,330 --> 01:14:41,696
- Just relax.
- Leave her alone!

1164
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:43,587
We want to talk to him
about a bank robbery.

1165
01:14:43,687 --> 01:14:44,317
<i>Don't you touch her!</i>

1166
01:14:44,418 --> 01:14:46,068
If you want to see your Eddie
or his mate Dave again,

1167
01:14:46,218 --> 01:14:48,099
make sure Terry Leather
calls that number.

1168
01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:51,230
Walkie-talkie gang
takes it all.

1169
01:14:51,330 --> 01:14:52,731
Read all about it.

1170
01:14:53,631 --> 01:14:55,732
Walkie-talkie gang
takes it all...

1171
01:14:56,201 --> 01:14:59,229
<i>- That's great news. Over.
- We're taking a break.</i>

1172
01:14:59,329 --> 01:15:00,615
<i>We need to get some sleep.</i>

1173
01:15:00,765 --> 01:15:03,160
<i>Getting a shut-eye. I want
the fumes cleared out. Over.</i>

1174
01:15:03,860 --> 01:15:05,861
<i>Lucky you.
My eyes are like...</i>

1175
01:15:06,002 --> 01:15:08,392
Mommy? Daddy is on the radio.

1176
01:15:08,492 --> 01:15:09,840
Don't be so silly, darling.

1177
01:15:09,941 --> 01:15:11,378
He is!

1178
01:15:11,962 --> 01:15:13,271
Is he?

1179
01:15:13,372 --> 01:15:15,694
<i>I want a warm bath and a cup of tea.
Over.</i>

1180
01:15:15,802 --> 01:15:19,267
<i>You'll get your cup of tea.
Just your odd time. Over.</i>

1181
01:15:19,368 --> 01:15:20,799
See?
It is daddy.

1182
01:15:20,899 --> 01:15:23,166
<i>Authorities have released this
recording of the walkie-talkie</i>

1183
01:15:23,283 --> 01:15:25,967
<i>communications between the robbers
of Lloyd´s Bank in Marylebone</i>

1184
01:15:26,123 --> 01:15:27,695
<i>in the hopes that their voices</i>

1185
01:15:27,845 --> 01:15:29,618
<i>may be identified by members
of the public...</i>

1186
01:15:30,103 --> 01:15:31,308
Hello?

1187
01:15:31,958 --> 01:15:33,262
Wendy?

1188
01:15:33,464 --> 01:15:35,776
We heard you on the radio, Terry.
You are famous, you know?

1189
01:15:35,884 --> 01:15:38,918
You robbed that bank, didn't you?
The one on the news.

1190
01:15:39,019 --> 01:15:42,407
Oh God, you could go to jail for years
for something like that, Terry.

1191
01:15:42,507 --> 01:15:43,487
I couldn't stand it.

1192
01:15:43,587 --> 01:15:44,871
No one is going to jail.

1193
01:15:44,972 --> 01:15:46,397
I've got everyone under control.

1194
01:15:46,497 --> 01:15:49,115
Just stay put.
Keep the kids inside.

1195
01:15:50,705 --> 01:15:52,540
I love you, Wendy.

1196
01:15:53,705 --> 01:15:54,939
I gotta go.

1197
01:15:55,890 --> 01:15:57,163
You be careful, Terry.

1198
01:15:57,264 --> 01:15:58,548
<i>What's the matter, mom?</i>

1199
01:15:59,298 --> 01:16:00,675
Nothing, darling.

1200
01:16:04,367 --> 01:16:08,310
- Terry, they took Eddie.
- Oh God. Who?

1201
01:16:08,410 --> 01:16:11,957
They didn't have fleece on.
I don't know, they could have been cops.

1202
01:16:12,057 --> 01:16:13,810
They left a phone number for you.

1203
01:16:13,987 --> 01:16:16,009
They said, if I want to see
Dave or Eddie again,

1204
01:16:16,159 --> 01:16:17,315
then you'll have to call.

1205
01:16:17,415 --> 01:16:19,081
Listen to me, I swear to you
we'll get them back.

1206
01:16:19,181 --> 01:16:20,669
Don't you worry, darling.

1207
01:16:20,770 --> 01:16:22,693
Have you got a pen?

1208
01:16:23,143 --> 01:16:24,068
Yeah.

1209
01:16:24,227 --> 01:16:27,152
<i>- 0-1-9-4-6.
- Hold on, say it again.</i>

1210
01:16:27,328 --> 01:16:31,003
<i>0-1-9-4-6.
- Yeah.</i>

1211
01:16:33,928 --> 01:16:36,748
Michael?
It's Lew Vogel. Yes.

1212
01:16:36,848 --> 01:16:38,729
Well, we've identified the villains.

1213
01:16:38,829 --> 01:16:41,225
<i>Believe it or not, they're
amateurs. Part-timers.</i>

1214
01:16:41,349 --> 01:16:44,610
They were put up to the job by
a woman named Martine Love.

1215
01:16:44,789 --> 01:16:46,247
- Ring a bell?
- Never heard of her.

1216
01:16:46,348 --> 01:16:47,915
Well, we paid a visit to her flat,

1217
01:16:48,015 --> 01:16:50,146
and some chaps from MI-5
were already there.

1218
01:16:50,550 --> 01:16:52,986
Pulled rank on my
tame copper.

1219
01:16:53,970 --> 01:16:56,157
Why do you suppose these
people would be interested

1220
01:16:56,307 --> 01:16:58,111
in the robbery of a minor
neighbourhood bank, Michael?

1221
01:16:58,211 --> 01:17:00,871
- I don't know.
- I think you do.

1222
01:17:00,971 --> 01:17:04,224
And I'm guessing that
your box is number 118?

1223
01:17:04,811 --> 01:17:07,875
<i>I think what these robbers were
really after were photographs.</i>

1224
01:17:08,551 --> 01:17:10,438
Photographs of a certain Royal Princess.

1225
01:17:10,538 --> 01:17:11,912
How do you know that?

1226
01:17:12,411 --> 01:17:14,662
Because on this point,
I believe my captive.

1227
01:17:14,931 --> 01:17:17,667
No man could withstand the pain
we inflicted on him.

1228
01:17:18,232 --> 01:17:20,148
So don't take me for a fool, Michael!

1229
01:17:20,272 --> 01:17:21,564
You've instigated this calamity

1230
01:17:21,664 --> 01:17:23,692
by storing your blackmail
materials in this bank.

1231
01:17:24,072 --> 01:17:24,986
Which you recommended.

1232
01:17:25,136 --> 01:17:27,046
I will not be lectured by the
porn king of Soho.

1233
01:17:27,412 --> 01:17:28,599
Get my pictures back,

1234
01:17:28,749 --> 01:17:31,127
or you will never see a black man
on the streets of London

1235
01:17:31,232 --> 01:17:33,552
without wondering if he's been sent
to kill you!

1236
01:17:54,594 --> 01:17:55,941
What are you doing?

1237
01:17:56,041 --> 01:17:59,231
Oh, hello Michael. Hakim was
looking for a copy of his book.

1238
01:18:01,054 --> 01:18:02,807
I know what you've been looking for.

1239
01:18:02,907 --> 01:18:04,402
You won't find it.

1240
01:18:04,502 --> 01:18:06,541
What are you talking about?

1241
01:18:08,076 --> 01:18:10,078
<i>Hakim, I found your book.</i>

1242
01:18:11,036 --> 01:18:12,455
You don't understand.

1243
01:18:12,905 --> 01:18:15,222
My box and those of my friends

1244
01:18:15,323 --> 01:18:17,211
may have been rifled.

1245
01:18:17,596 --> 01:18:18,982
Surely you can pull some strings.

1246
01:18:19,132 --> 01:18:20,823
You're a minister in the
government, for God's sake!

1247
01:18:20,996 --> 01:18:23,609
Sonia, I really don't think
I am able to help here.

1248
01:18:23,917 --> 01:18:25,698
Perhaps you don't fully comprehend.

1249
01:18:25,799 --> 01:18:29,907
I have photographs,
compromising photographs,

1250
01:18:30,417 --> 01:18:31,931
live films of you,

1251
01:18:32,031 --> 01:18:34,481
Miles Urquhart, all my regulars,

1252
01:18:34,581 --> 01:18:37,365
in this safe deposit box.

1253
01:18:37,858 --> 01:18:40,347
You all know each other if
that's any consolation.

1254
01:18:40,818 --> 01:18:43,169
You've got photographs of me?

1255
01:18:43,269 --> 01:18:45,764
You conniving cunt!

1256
01:18:49,339 --> 01:18:50,701
You be a big boy.

1257
01:18:51,251 --> 01:18:53,100
Now is the time to talk
to your White Hall chums,

1258
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:54,165
don't you think?

1259
01:18:56,559 --> 01:18:58,878
That's him.
Sure that's him.

1260
01:19:00,419 --> 01:19:03,180
Guy Arthur Singer,
con man and petty criminal.

1261
01:19:03,659 --> 01:19:05,726
Did a stretch in the "Scrubs"
a few years back.

1262
01:19:05,826 --> 01:19:08,578
I thought he was a wanker.
Spoke with some poncey accent.

1263
01:19:09,780 --> 01:19:11,803
Thank you, sir, very much.

1264
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:20,368
- Hello?
- Who am I talking to?

1265
01:19:20,468 --> 01:19:24,564
Terry Leather, Kevin Swain,
Martine Love, Eddie Burton.

1266
01:19:24,665 --> 01:19:27,073
Yeah, Mr. Shilling was kind
enough to speak with me about this.

1267
01:19:27,541 --> 01:19:28,892
You put Dave on the phone.

1268
01:19:29,021 --> 01:19:30,435
Now, I would, but...

1269
01:19:30,585 --> 01:19:33,133
he seems a bit indisposed
at the moment.

1270
01:19:33,681 --> 01:19:34,979
<i>What do you want?</i>

1271
01:19:35,082 --> 01:19:36,999
Just a couple of things
from what you've stolen.

1272
01:19:37,149 --> 01:19:39,538
A ledger with a dark red cover.

1273
01:19:39,638 --> 01:19:40,768
And some photos

1274
01:19:40,963 --> 01:19:43,413
that I'm sure the MI-5
is interested in.

1275
01:19:43,883 --> 01:19:45,528
The "Royal portfolio".

1276
01:19:46,663 --> 01:19:48,701
All we got is money and jewels.

1277
01:19:48,802 --> 01:19:50,508
Then I suggest you look again.

1278
01:19:51,303 --> 01:19:52,447
Speak to your friends.

1279
01:19:52,547 --> 01:19:55,166
- Hello, who is this?
- Eddie, it's Terry.

1280
01:19:55,266 --> 01:19:56,053
Terry...

1281
01:19:56,603 --> 01:19:57,922
Terry, fucking hell.

1282
01:19:59,273 --> 01:20:00,342
Dave's all messed up,

1283
01:20:00,464 --> 01:20:02,431
and they're going to do the same
to me, you got to help.

1284
01:20:02,944 --> 01:20:04,087
Listen to me, Eddie.

1285
01:20:05,238 --> 01:20:06,665
I don't have what he wants.

1286
01:20:06,824 --> 01:20:10,125
No? No, you've got to have what
they want, you've got to.

1287
01:20:11,426 --> 01:20:12,426
You've got to help.

1288
01:20:12,526 --> 01:20:15,205
Eddie, what am I supposed to do?
You tell him, we don't have it!

1289
01:20:15,605 --> 01:20:17,478
- No, Terry. Terry, you gotta-
- Eddie,

1290
01:20:17,628 --> 01:20:20,015
Tell him I don't have
his fucking ledger!

1291
01:20:20,305 --> 01:20:22,211
<i>You tell that cunt now!</i>

1292
01:20:23,585 --> 01:20:25,415
He doesn't have it...

1293
01:20:26,265 --> 01:20:27,284
Right.

1294
01:20:29,385 --> 01:20:30,168
Wait...

1295
01:20:30,268 --> 01:20:31,386
No! No!

1296
01:20:31,966 --> 01:20:34,562
No! They shot Dave!

1297
01:20:34,846 --> 01:20:36,451
- Eddie?
- Dave is dead.

1298
01:20:36,551 --> 01:20:38,552
- Eddie!
- They shot him, Terry...

1299
01:20:41,827 --> 01:20:44,060
I'll give you one hour
to find what I want,

1300
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:45,950
<i>or I'll kill this man.</i>

1301
01:21:03,868 --> 01:21:05,462
This is it.

1302
01:21:06,908 --> 01:21:08,021
Lew Vogel.

1303
01:21:08,871 --> 01:21:10,532
That's what this bastard is.

1304
01:21:12,889 --> 01:21:16,374
"Payments made to Soho and
West End division officers"

1305
01:21:18,549 --> 01:21:23,153
There are weekly payouts.
50 quid here, 20 there.

1306
01:21:24,550 --> 01:21:26,926
Probably every bad copper in London.

1307
01:21:28,310 --> 01:21:29,933
Nothing like this was
supposed to happen.

1308
01:21:30,033 --> 01:21:31,293
No one was supposed to get hurt.

1309
01:21:31,444 --> 01:21:32,746
It's not your fault,
right?

1310
01:21:32,846 --> 01:21:34,816
We still got our own exit to think about,
and Eddie.

1311
01:21:34,916 --> 01:21:38,085
If we give the photos to Vogel,
all bets are off with Tim.

1312
01:21:38,191 --> 01:21:40,796
If we deliver it to Tim,
it's Eddie's neck

1313
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:42,593
and Vogel is still after us.

1314
01:21:42,694 --> 01:21:44,404
Either way we are fucked.

1315
01:21:48,592 --> 01:21:50,584
Miles, we've got a problem,

1316
01:21:50,685 --> 01:21:52,025
a serious problem.

1317
01:21:52,312 --> 01:21:53,861
Something Sonia Bern
kept in the bank

1318
01:21:54,011 --> 01:21:55,708
that was robbed
over the weekend.

1319
01:21:55,993 --> 01:21:58,106
She is concerned that her
safe deposit box

1320
01:21:58,256 --> 01:21:59,626
may have been plundered.

1321
01:21:59,733 --> 01:22:02,544
I'm afraid her fears
are well justified.

1322
01:22:03,753 --> 01:22:05,141
Oh my God.

1323
01:22:05,593 --> 01:22:09,014
I really thought Sonia was a
woman of more discreet character.

1324
01:22:10,173 --> 01:22:13,422
So...
The genie is out of the bottle then.

1325
01:22:13,714 --> 01:22:15,999
- For both of us, ey?
- Not quite yet.

1326
01:22:16,213 --> 01:22:18,634
My operatives tell me
that the thieves

1327
01:22:18,784 --> 01:22:21,948
are using the photographs
as a bargaining chip.

1328
01:22:22,048 --> 01:22:24,613
- Then give them what they want.
- Already in motion.

1329
01:22:24,814 --> 01:22:26,228
And the committee having
done the works

1330
01:22:26,378 --> 01:22:28,731
to issue a "D-notice"
on the whole business.

1331
01:22:29,715 --> 01:22:32,718
To muffle the press.
Put a lid on it.

1332
01:23:10,798 --> 01:23:13,016
Big pity, wouldn't it?

1333
01:23:13,118 --> 01:23:16,589
Well, if your mates abandoned you
over a few photographs.

1334
01:23:23,091 --> 01:23:24,091
Hello.

1335
01:23:24,279 --> 01:23:28,340
You listen to me, Mr."Vogel" or
whatever your fucking name is.

1336
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:30,600
You go ahead and kill him,
see if we give a shit.

1337
01:23:30,879 --> 01:23:32,309
We got our loot.

1338
01:23:32,409 --> 01:23:34,014
Your ledgers and your photos,

1339
01:23:34,114 --> 01:23:35,549
you can pick 'em up
from Scotland Yard.

1340
01:23:35,650 --> 01:23:36,613
We're sending them over.

1341
01:23:37,063 --> 01:23:38,080
Don't do that.

1342
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:40,826
Well, if you want your book
of payoffs back,

1343
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:44,568
be at Paddington Station in
person tomorrow 11 am, platform 1.

1344
01:23:44,861 --> 01:23:48,117
There's a newsstand near
the statue of the soldier.

1345
01:23:48,217 --> 01:23:50,435
Have Eddie with you,
hale and hearty.

1346
01:23:50,821 --> 01:23:52,886
This is your one and
only chance, Vogel.

1347
01:23:52,986 --> 01:23:54,784
Don't blow it.

1348
01:24:11,803 --> 01:24:14,292
Don't answer it!
Catherine!

1349
01:24:14,403 --> 01:24:16,233
- Daddy!
- How are you?

1350
01:24:16,483 --> 01:24:17,943
Come here.

1351
01:24:20,083 --> 01:24:21,929
Here.
Look, I got you a present.

1352
01:24:22,504 --> 01:24:25,480
- You been good for mommy?
- Yeah.

1353
01:24:29,684 --> 01:24:31,359
I need to talk to mommy about something,

1354
01:24:31,509 --> 01:24:32,913
so give us a minute, okay?

1355
01:24:33,013 --> 01:24:35,014
- Go on.
- Good girls.

1356
01:24:45,565 --> 01:24:48,261
So.. you want to tell me
what's been going on?

1357
01:24:49,125 --> 01:24:52,539
- Some blokes worked over Dave.
- How bad?

1358
01:24:53,986 --> 01:24:55,180
He's dead.

1359
01:24:55,966 --> 01:24:57,993
Oh my God Almighty, Terry.

1360
01:24:58,093 --> 01:24:59,849
What have you done to us?

1361
01:24:59,966 --> 01:25:03,687
Wendy, I promise,
I'm gonna work this out.

1362
01:25:03,787 --> 01:25:05,457
And when I do,
we're going to leave England.

1363
01:25:05,607 --> 01:25:07,332
and it's all going
to change for us.

1364
01:25:09,167 --> 01:25:10,806
But if anything goes wrong, use this.

1365
01:25:11,156 --> 01:25:13,910
There is plenty of cash.
Pounds, francs, dollars.

1366
01:25:14,308 --> 01:25:15,556
You're going to leave the country,

1367
01:25:15,706 --> 01:25:17,212
start a new life for you and the girls.

1368
01:25:18,287 --> 01:25:20,513
You can do this if you have to,
Wendy. Promise me.

1369
01:25:20,613 --> 01:25:22,243
Is that from the robbery, is it?

1370
01:25:24,294 --> 01:25:25,598
My share, yeah.

1371
01:25:25,748 --> 01:25:28,178
The papers said there was a woman
in the vault.

1372
01:25:28,589 --> 01:25:30,677
Martine, so was she involved?

1373
01:25:30,868 --> 01:25:32,715
Yeah. She brought us the job
in the first place.

1374
01:25:32,816 --> 01:25:34,648
Oh, and did you sleep
with her, Terry?

1375
01:25:42,969 --> 01:25:46,542
I did know that from day one.
It was the way she looked.

1376
01:25:46,650 --> 01:25:48,714
The first day we met
I said to my friend Audrey, I said:

1377
01:25:48,814 --> 01:25:52,826
"I am gonna marry him.
And I am gonna have his kids."

1378
01:25:52,990 --> 01:25:57,893
And I have stuck by you.... I 
stuck by you no matter what!

1379
01:25:58,093 --> 01:25:59,694
You bastard!!

1380
01:26:03,495 --> 01:26:04,496
Fuck...

1381
01:26:12,291 --> 01:26:13,588
You can throw me over.

1382
01:26:15,238 --> 01:26:16,932
I deserve it.

1383
01:26:18,452 --> 01:26:20,159
I brought you more
grief than happiness,

1384
01:26:21,252 --> 01:26:24,200
but I love you.
And the kids.

1385
01:26:26,353 --> 01:26:29,448
So the reason I did this was to get
us out of this life once and for all.

1386
01:26:29,973 --> 01:26:31,556
<i>Mommy, open the door.</i>

1387
01:26:35,433 --> 01:26:36,240
<i>Mommy, mommy!</i>

1388
01:26:36,390 --> 01:26:38,562
- We have the rest of our lives,
- Go play in your room!

1389
01:26:41,574 --> 01:26:43,929
...if you'll still have me.

1390
01:27:06,415 --> 01:27:09,407
She takes a good picture, eh, Tim?

1391
01:27:09,615 --> 01:27:11,295
Lord Mountbatten has graciously
agreed to represent

1392
01:27:11,445 --> 01:27:13,123
the interest of the crown
in this matter.

1393
01:27:13,224 --> 01:27:15,919
- Is he high enough up the tree?
- Lord Mountbatten.

1394
01:27:16,019 --> 01:27:17,933
I always wanted to meet that bugger.

1395
01:27:18,033 --> 01:27:19,861
Yes. I am not sure he will be
very pleased to meet you, too.

1396
01:27:19,997 --> 01:27:23,083
He has to be under the main clock
Paddington Station, 11 am, or no deal.

1397
01:27:23,197 --> 01:27:24,292
11 am, on the knock,

1398
01:27:24,392 --> 01:27:26,093
and with your new
passports and documents.

1399
01:27:26,193 --> 01:27:28,309
He's gonna hand them over
as soon as he sees the photos.

1400
01:27:28,818 --> 01:27:30,052
There's another problem.

1401
01:27:30,152 --> 01:27:31,942
This robbery's pissed off
some local villains.

1402
01:27:32,238 --> 01:27:34,067
The guts come with the glory, eh?

1403
01:27:34,458 --> 01:27:36,038
One of our mates has been killed.

1404
01:27:36,138 --> 01:27:38,439
That's hardly surprising considering
the roster of reprobates

1405
01:27:38,589 --> 01:27:40,534
that are the banks'
deposit box customers.

1406
01:27:40,918 --> 01:27:42,267
Listen, Terry.
Our committment is for...

1407
01:27:42,417 --> 01:27:44,366
the recovery of the
royal...portraits only.

1408
01:27:45,158 --> 01:27:47,985
The proceeds and the piss-offs
are both yours to deal with.

1409
01:27:52,079 --> 01:27:54,076
11 am, Paddington Station.

1410
01:28:06,380 --> 01:28:07,306
Gale.

1411
01:28:07,657 --> 01:28:09,441
Michael wants to see you
in the garden.

1412
01:28:10,020 --> 01:28:12,216
- What for?
- I don't know.

1413
01:28:17,721 --> 01:28:20,079
Gale, come.
Come and look at this.

1414
01:28:20,679 --> 01:28:21,679
Come.

1415
01:28:23,661 --> 01:28:26,658
- I want to show you something.
- What's this for?

1416
01:28:29,102 --> 01:28:30,487
It's for you.

1417
01:28:30,587 --> 01:28:32,639
What have I done to deserve this?
What have I done?

1418
01:28:32,739 --> 01:28:34,811
You're a spy, sent to steal
from me.

1419
01:28:35,302 --> 01:28:38,722
And nobody steals from Michael X.
No-one!

1420
01:28:42,642 --> 01:28:44,826
See if it mentions the copper in charge.

1421
01:28:47,603 --> 01:28:48,485
Here it is.

1422
01:28:48,635 --> 01:28:50,396
"Heading the case is
Detective Sergeant

1423
01:28:50,496 --> 01:28:52,535
"Roy Given of Marylebone Lane
police station."

1424
01:28:54,063 --> 01:28:56,092
Roy Given?

1425
01:28:56,192 --> 01:28:58,088
No Roy Given menioned.

1426
01:28:58,864 --> 01:29:00,445
Let's hope that means
he's straight.

1427
01:29:00,545 --> 01:29:03,155
And that he'd be interested in the
names of some bent coppers.

1428
01:29:03,255 --> 01:29:05,100
Yeah, a bit of a long shot.

1429
01:29:07,805 --> 01:29:08,880
Fuck it...

1430
01:29:09,030 --> 01:29:10,715
- Nothing in that one?
- No.

1431
01:29:13,065 --> 01:29:16,424
What, we don't rate a mention.
Strike you as strange?

1432
01:29:16,546 --> 01:29:17,924
It's kind of scary actually.

1433
01:29:18,105 --> 01:29:20,389
If that news could disappear,
so could we.

1434
01:29:21,489 --> 01:29:23,290
<i>Next stop: Edgware Road.</i>

1435
01:29:23,846 --> 01:29:24,732
Well...

1436
01:29:24,882 --> 01:29:26,151
Here's to us.

1437
01:29:28,567 --> 01:29:30,409
See you, mate.

1438
01:29:31,086 --> 01:29:33,294
Look after yourself.
Take care.

1439
01:29:34,687 --> 01:29:36,029
Good luck, Kev.

1440
01:29:45,047 --> 01:29:48,395
So where are you headed?
If everything goes to plan?

1441
01:29:50,408 --> 01:29:52,850
I'll tell you,
if you're coming with me.

1442
01:30:09,949 --> 01:30:12,341
Good morning.
I'm looking for a Mr. Roy Given.

1443
01:30:12,729 --> 01:30:13,932
It's very important.

1444
01:30:14,082 --> 01:30:15,715
- Roy Given?
- Yeah.

1445
01:30:17,290 --> 01:30:19,207
Can I ask
what it's concerning?

1446
01:30:19,309 --> 01:30:21,346
No, I prefer to tell him myself.

1447
01:30:21,530 --> 01:30:23,041
Look, all I'm saying is,
if you're interested

1448
01:30:23,191 --> 01:30:24,682
in the rest of
this book of payoffs,

1449
01:30:24,782 --> 01:30:26,437
the author's gonna be
at Paddington Station

1450
01:30:26,587 --> 01:30:28,127
11 am, platform one.

1451
01:30:28,230 --> 01:30:30,925
And how exactly did this come
into your possession?

1452
01:30:31,325 --> 01:30:34,427
<i>Next stop: Paddington Station.
Change here for the Bakerloo line.</i>

1453
01:30:34,811 --> 01:30:37,260
Let's hope now he turns up
fashionably late.

1454
01:30:51,732 --> 01:30:54,574
- There's your friend, Tim.
- Good luck.

1455
01:31:07,173 --> 01:31:08,767
It's good to see you in one piece.

1456
01:31:09,174 --> 01:31:11,946
You were worried for your own arse,
Tim, not for mine.

1457
01:31:20,735 --> 01:31:21,995
You're a prick, Tim.

1458
01:31:22,095 --> 01:31:24,065
You set this whole thing up
from the start, didn't you?

1459
01:31:24,165 --> 01:31:26,152
Come on, you get to be
rich, free and clear.

1460
01:31:26,252 --> 01:31:27,752
Isn't that what you wanted?

1461
01:31:50,397 --> 01:31:52,909
- You stay here with the car.
- Right.

1462
01:31:54,537 --> 01:31:57,292
Bloody kidney stone.
It's gotta go out soon.

1463
01:32:42,460 --> 01:32:44,761
I haven't had this much excitement
since the war.

1464
01:32:45,041 --> 01:32:46,475
We're a little late, My Lord.

1465
01:32:56,962 --> 01:32:58,293
So where is your mate?

1466
01:32:58,394 --> 01:33:00,728
There, sir, that one at the newsstand.

1467
01:33:06,322 --> 01:33:09,592
Wait. I've seen those two cowboys
before at the girl's flat.

1468
01:33:09,692 --> 01:33:11,459
- It's a trap, they're MI-5.
- Terry.

1469
01:33:11,759 --> 01:33:12,759
<i>Terry.</i>

1470
01:33:22,263 --> 01:33:23,759
- Lord Mountbatten?
- Yes?

1471
01:33:23,859 --> 01:33:26,452
You know the arrangements
and you agree to our new identities

1472
01:33:26,552 --> 01:33:27,997
and immunity from
prosecution?

1473
01:33:28,184 --> 01:33:30,560
You have my word that the crown
will honour this committment.

1474
01:33:30,964 --> 01:33:33,474
Your documentation and
guarantees

1475
01:33:36,105 --> 01:33:38,399
If I were you, I'd keep
them in a very safe place.

1476
01:33:38,685 --> 01:33:40,934
Yeah, well, you bet it won't
be a safe deposit box.

1477
01:33:49,486 --> 01:33:53,172
She is a scallywag.
Thank you.

1478
01:33:57,973 --> 01:33:58,974
Martine.

1479
01:33:59,926 --> 01:34:01,544
It wasn't all business for me.

1480
01:34:06,047 --> 01:34:08,341
- What happened, where's the book?
- Just open the door.

1481
01:34:08,527 --> 01:34:10,020
- No!
Get in there.

1482
01:34:10,120 --> 01:34:11,621
Stay there,
or you're dead meat!

1483
01:34:16,007 --> 01:34:17,742
Where are you going, old man, eh?

1484
01:34:17,842 --> 01:34:18,842
No!

1485
01:34:20,888 --> 01:34:22,798
- This one's for Dave.
- No...

1486
01:34:23,408 --> 01:34:24,659
You fucker!

1487
01:34:26,988 --> 01:34:29,401
Not so fucking smug now, are ya?

1488
01:34:35,303 --> 01:34:36,803
Oi, you punk!

1489
01:35:13,091 --> 01:35:15,284
- Eddie, get out.
- That's the one that killed Dave.

1490
01:35:15,384 --> 01:35:16,585
Get your hands off me!

1491
01:35:17,492 --> 01:35:19,323
Arrest them,
they are bank robbers.

1492
01:35:20,013 --> 01:35:21,777
- Fuck!
- This bloke killed our friend!

1493
01:35:21,877 --> 01:35:23,278
- Shit.
- No, no, listen...

1494
01:35:33,573 --> 01:35:35,805
So, are we seriously
arseholed now, Terry?

1495
01:35:35,905 --> 01:35:38,488
Well, at least we're not dead
like poor old Dave.

1496
01:35:41,094 --> 01:35:43,973
Get up, you filthy bastard.

1497
01:35:44,073 --> 01:35:46,202
You're under arrest.
Take him away.

1498
01:35:46,302 --> 01:35:47,703
<i>All right. Come on, you.</i>

1499
01:35:48,514 --> 01:35:49,697
<i>Get in the car.</i>

1500
01:35:55,799 --> 01:35:57,199
It's all right, mate.

1501
01:36:05,096 --> 01:36:06,645
I wonder if that's Roy Given?

1502
01:36:10,156 --> 01:36:11,305
Who's he?

1503
01:36:12,076 --> 01:36:14,182
I was hoping he was a straight copper.

1504
01:36:15,516 --> 01:36:17,146
We've got a nice
collar here, Roy.

1505
01:36:17,246 --> 01:36:19,615
You know, these two are part of
the Baker Street bank robbery gang.

1506
01:36:20,397 --> 01:36:21,933
- Place this man under arrest.
- Yes, sir.

1507
01:36:22,037 --> 01:36:24,347
What are you talking about?
They're part of the Baker Street Firm.

1508
01:36:24,448 --> 01:36:25,379
I don't know about that.

1509
01:36:25,479 --> 01:36:27,659
But I know all about you,
you corrupt bastard.

1510
01:36:27,759 --> 01:36:29,760
Cuff him.
The one over by the wall as well.

1511
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:31,474
But they're the robbers!

1512
01:36:33,458 --> 01:36:34,692
No robbers in here.

1513
01:36:34,792 --> 01:36:35,792
<i>Watch your head.</i>

1514
01:36:36,918 --> 01:36:37,469
Now...

1515
01:36:38,019 --> 01:36:40,953
I believe you've a certain
Mr. Vogel's book of shame.

1516
01:36:41,639 --> 01:36:44,052
Well, if you let me out,
I'll go get it for you.

1517
01:36:47,339 --> 01:36:48,898
That belongs to me.

1518
01:36:55,380 --> 01:36:56,675
Here's your book.

1519
01:36:56,775 --> 01:36:58,776
Terry. We were thinking,
a smart fella like you

1520
01:36:58,876 --> 01:37:01,608
might have kept mementos
of the event, just in case.

1521
01:37:01,708 --> 01:37:04,191
Case what?
Things didn't turn out so nicely?

1522
01:37:04,300 --> 01:37:06,107
If they should ever see the light of day

1523
01:37:06,257 --> 01:37:08,056
don't think we can't find you.

1524
01:37:14,581 --> 01:37:17,073
Out.
Go on, piss off.

1525
01:37:18,001 --> 01:37:19,397
Aren't you gone?

1526
01:37:19,902 --> 01:37:22,554
- How did that happen?
- Fucked if I know, just keep walking.

1527
01:37:32,557 --> 01:37:33,857
Michael, Michael!

1528
01:37:38,463 --> 01:37:41,284
What's going on?
What do you want in my place?

1529
01:37:41,384 --> 01:37:42,492
What do you want?

1530
01:37:42,592 --> 01:37:44,574
- We are placing you under arrest.
- What am I charged with?

1531
01:37:44,674 --> 01:37:48,042
Conspiracy to import drugs into
the United Kingdom, will that do?

1532
01:37:48,143 --> 01:37:49,744
But you could still help yourself.

1533
01:37:50,304 --> 01:37:53,580
There's a British national staying
with you, a certain Gale Benson.

1534
01:37:53,704 --> 01:37:55,340
She was here, but she's gone on.

1535
01:37:59,742 --> 01:38:01,743
<i>- All right.
- Get in the back!</i>

1536
01:38:11,505 --> 01:38:12,929
Over here, sir.

1537
01:38:31,106 --> 01:38:32,274
Burn the house down.

1538
01:38:32,374 --> 01:38:34,312
I want nothing of this place
left standing.

1539
01:38:52,989 --> 01:38:54,563
- Were you friends of Dave?
- Oh yeah.

1540
01:38:54,713 --> 01:38:55,173
- Really?

1541
01:38:55,273 --> 01:38:57,434
We knew him in a professional capacity.

1542
01:38:58,268 --> 01:39:00,406
He was one of our favourites.

1543
01:39:01,006 --> 01:39:02,007
See you later.

1544
01:39:03,307 --> 01:39:05,308
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1545
01:39:06,009 --> 01:39:07,754
So where are you off to, Kevin?

1546
01:39:07,854 --> 01:39:09,218
Anywhere you want to go.

1547
01:39:10,289 --> 01:39:12,413
Sorry, I'm doing a solo
from now on.

1548
01:39:12,789 --> 01:39:13,782
Yeah, well.

1549
01:39:13,882 --> 01:39:15,115
It was worth a try.

1550
01:39:15,870 --> 01:39:17,368
Do you want another one?

1551
01:39:17,518 --> 01:39:19,815
Yeah, go on.
One for the road.

1552
01:39:20,915 --> 01:39:22,916
Tummy.

1553
01:39:24,671 --> 01:39:26,426
I just wish Dave could have
seen all this.

1554
01:39:26,531 --> 01:39:28,322
Yeah...
Here's to Dave.

1555
01:39:28,823 --> 01:39:30,023
To Dave.

1556
01:39:36,991 --> 01:39:38,506
What do you want, Martine?

1557
01:39:39,492 --> 01:39:41,551
I'm sorry I've caused you
this upset, Wendy.

1558
01:39:41,912 --> 01:39:43,787
Well, apparently we're rich.

1559
01:39:46,132 --> 01:39:49,593
I know the business is finished,
but are the cars really ours?

1560
01:39:52,312 --> 01:39:53,352
Yeah.

1561
01:39:55,653 --> 01:39:57,153
They are all yours.

1562
01:39:58,734 --> 01:40:00,372
Jessul has been paid off.

1563
01:40:01,514 --> 01:40:02,854
I won't lie to you...

1564
01:40:03,704 --> 01:40:05,200
I would have gone with him,

1565
01:40:05,300 --> 01:40:07,695
and I would have shut
you out of my mind,

1566
01:40:08,734 --> 01:40:10,876
but he didn't want to know.

1567
01:40:16,034 --> 01:40:17,425
I'm sorry.

1568
01:40:19,715 --> 01:40:22,916
- Your wife is talking to Martine.
- I know, Kev.

1569
01:40:23,316 --> 01:40:24,416
I know...

1570
01:40:27,555 --> 01:40:28,761
Good luck.

1571
01:40:43,637 --> 01:40:45,239
It was always you, Terry.

1572
01:41:13,048 --> 01:41:14,199
Daddy!

1573
01:41:14,299 --> 01:41:15,049
Hey!

1574
01:41:15,649 --> 01:41:17,250
Oh my God, Terry,
that's a big one.

1575
01:41:17,399 --> 01:41:19,403
Last a few chips though,
innit?

1576
01:41:19,503 --> 01:41:21,603
<i>- Don't, mom!</i>

1577
01:41:29,880 --> 01:41:31,910
- Fish fingers tonight, eh?
- What a pretty boy...
