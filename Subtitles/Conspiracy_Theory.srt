1
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:20,066
July eighth, 1979...

2
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:24,109
all the fathers of Nobel Prize
winners were rounded up...

3
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,868
By United Nations military
units, all right?

4
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,200
...and actually
forced at gunpoint...

5
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:32,367
to give semen samples
in little plastic jars...

6
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:37,004
which are now stored below Rockefeller
Center, underneath the ice skating rink.

7
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:40,507
I wouldn't want to be there
for the thaw. Ha-ha-ha. Yuck.

8
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:42,009
I mean, it's disgusting!

9
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:44,340
You know what they put
in the water, don't you?

10
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:46,972
Fluoride! Yeah, fluoride.

11
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,134
On the pretext that it
strengthens your teeth!

12
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,520
That's ridiculous! You know
what this stuff does to you?

13
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:55,977
It actually weakens your will...

14
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:59,939
takes away the capacity for
free and creative thought...

15
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:02,275
and makes you a slave to the state.

16
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:09,449
Ever wonder about all these militia groups,
survivalist-type kooks on the right-wing side?

17
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:13,332
They say that they're defending
the country from the U.N. troops.

18
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:18,041
These guys yelling so loud, my theory
is... And this is a conspiracy, pal.

19
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:20,213
They are the U.N. troops.
They're in place!

20
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:22,625
The infrastructure's ready.
It's a <i>fait accompli.</i>

21
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,793
They'll just take over.
We'll all be toast.

22
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,429
Oswald. Yeah, that's
what I said, Oswald.

23
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:31,013
He said, "I'm just a patsy."
That means he didn't do it, right?

24
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:33,597
Armand Hammer goes to the doctor.

25
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,808
The doctor says, "Hey, Armand..."

26
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:37,769
you've only got 3 minutes to live."

27
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,104
And he says, "Oh, God,
that's terrible news."

28
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:43,396
Isn't there anything you can do
for me, doc? Three minutes?"

29
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:46,156
And the doctor says,
"Well, I can boil you an egg."

30
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:50,111
I guess not. All right.

31
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:53,156
Do you ever see those
advertisements, like, "Got Milk?"

32
00:01:57,534 --> 00:02:00,333
Hey, Open up! Open it up!

33
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,964
What's going on in there?
Open it up.

34
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,046
Son of a bitch!

35
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,131
"Eat beef"?

36
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:12,050
That's like saying, "Smoke cigarettes,"
or "Drive cars." I mean, it's real generic.

37
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:15,890
This guy looks at me and says, "You
think you're living in a free country?"

38
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:18,602
"You think it's a democracy?
Of course it's not."

39
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:22,189
Web sites, newsletters,
self-published manifestos.

40
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:23,694
They think we're kooks.

41
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:27,231
George Bush knew what he was saying
when he said, "New World Order."

42
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,445
You remember those
three little words?

43
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:34,034
He was a 33rd degree Mason, you know,
and as ex-director of the CIA...

44
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:37,416
he knew that saying that would send
conspiratologists everywhere...

45
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,793
spinning, spinning their wheels.

46
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,874
Then they destroy their
own credibility.

47
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:45,587
Don't get me wrong, sister, I'm sure
your heart's in the right place...

48
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:49,970
but, you know, somebody's got to lift
the festering scab that is the Vatican.

49
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:56,310
A chip for identification so they can
track down an animal anywhere he's at.

50
00:02:56,468 --> 00:03:00,223
You'll insert it under the dog's skin
and it's an identification thing.

51
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:03,518
I mean, it's only a
small logical step...

52
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:07,188
until they start putting it in us and
our children. Before we know it...

53
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:10,866
they'll probably come
with the pretext...

54
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:15,245
Sure. Hey, is that one of the new hundreds
where they changed picture of Ben Franklin?

55
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:16,951
Look at him. He looks like...

56
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:20,118
the love child of Fred
Mertz and Rosie O'Donnell.

57
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:23,162
Yeah, that's him. Get rid of
them as soon as you can, lady.

58
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:26,582
Look at it. See the metal strip in it?
That's a tracking device.

59
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:30,548
If you got any more of those at home,
get rid of them. Exchange them.

60
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:34,841
They'll follow you. They know where
every one of those hundreds is going...

61
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,429
Black helicopters. You heard
about them? The black helicopters?

62
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,347
They're... They're everywhere.

63
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:47,987
They're on whisper mode. You can't
hear them until they've already gone.

64
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:49,567
You know?

65
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,698
No. There's nobody there.
Where did...? Where did they...?

66
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:59,081
Where'd they go? Oh, there
was nobody in here! Nobody.

67
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,662
What am I talking...?
Why is the meter on?

68
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,333
Taxi!

69
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,458
Taxi!

70
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,394
- Where to, pal?
- Luxembourg Towers, on 7th.

71
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,184
Okay.

72
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,119
The sound of love.

73
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,533
Excuse me?

74
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,042
That, what you just did.

75
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,170
- That's love.
- Heh.

76
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,957
"Love is just a way of saying,
"I want to sleep with you."

77
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,296
Admit it. I saw you kiss her.

78
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,008
You love her. This is the
street where love lives.

79
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,389
Love is bullshit.

80
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,391
Love gives you wings.

81
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,552
It makes you fly.

82
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:04,680
I don't even call it love.

83
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,182
I call it "Geronimo."

84
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:09,518
- Geronimo?
- Yeah.

85
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:12,062
Geronimo. See, when
you're in love, you'll...

86
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:15,699
jump right from the top of the
Empire State and you won't care.

87
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:19,361
Screaming "Geronimo" the whole
way down. It's great.

88
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:22,873
Yeah, but then you'll die. You'll squash
yourself. So, what's the point?

89
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:26,035
Hey, aren't you listening? I'm
telling you, love gives you wings.

90
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:30,043
She must be some girl.

91
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:33,008
I love her so bad, I just...

92
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,214
Well, she wrecks me.

93
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,464
I'd die for her.

94
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,348
She feel the same about you?

95
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,564
I don't know.

96
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:55,446
Uh, I never told her.

97
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:56,822
Why the hell not?

98
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:03,155
Uh...

99
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:07,121
I have some problems.

100
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,992
- You dumb creep!
- Oh, my God!

101
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,617
Stop the cab!

102
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,881
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

103
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:01,797
- Shut up! Wacko!
- I'm sorry.

104
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,882
Forget the fare.

105
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:15,564
Love Street.

106
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:52,602
<i>Yeah, sure, it's possible Lee
Harvey Oswald didn't kill Kennedy.</i>

107
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:54,812
<i>And frankly,
it's possible Jack Ruby...</i>

108
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:59,276
<i>didn't kill Oswald. Look at those films,
you see this other guy hanging around.</i>

109
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:02,281
<i>Are you saying that
Oswald is still alive?</i>

110
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,365
<i>Well, no. Somebody who looked
like Lee Harvey Oswald.</i>

111
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,493
She's singing.

112
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:30,136
<i>Can't take my eyes off of you</i>

113
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,433
Bingo.

114
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:49,746
<i>I love you, baby</i>

115
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:54,080
<i>And if it's quite all right
I need you, baby</i>

116
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,121
<i>Through all the lonely night
I love you, baby</i>

117
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:02,384
<i>Trust in my when I say</i>

118
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:05,629
<i>Oh, pretty baby</i>

119
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,513
<i>Don't bring me down, I pray</i>

120
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,720
<i>Pretty baby</i>

121
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,444
<i>Now that I've found you, stay</i>

122
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:15,393
<i>And let me love you,
baby, let me love you</i>

123
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:22,647
<i>You're just too good to be true</i>

124
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:26,737
<i>Can't take my eyes off of you</i>

125
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,200
<i>You'd be like heaven to touch</i>

126
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,657
<i>I wanna hold you so much</i>

127
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,496
Why do you do that?

128
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,537
Why do you push yourself?

129
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:42,127
<i>And I thank God I'm alive</i>

130
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,169
<i>You're just too good to be true</i>

131
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:49,882
<i>Can't take my eyes off of you</i>

132
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:18,372
Whoa!

133
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:20,629
- Yo, brother!
- What are you doing?

134
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,039
Go ahead, play on.

135
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:23,752
Hey, what's up?

136
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:36,386
Ha-ha-ha! Look at him.

137
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,690
Come on, keep up! Keep UP!

138
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,023
- Can you swim, man?
- Ha-ha-ha!

139
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:48,315
The water main broke all the way
up on 40th Street and 7th Avenue.

140
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,609
- Yeah?
- They say the subway's a damn river.

141
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,493
Strange.

142
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,117
What's up, Jerry?
What are you thinking?

143
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,824
Water mains don't usually
break unless it's wintertime.

144
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,460
The pipes burst open
because it's cold.

145
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:03,167
And it's only the first of October.

146
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,674
- Reminds me of life in the delta.
- Yeah, Mississippi, all right.

147
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,670
- Mekong, my friend. Mekong.
- Oh.

148
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:13,807
Hey, Flip, did I ever tell you
that the whole Vietnam War...

149
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,638
was fought over a bet...

150
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,973
that Howard Hughes lost
to Aristotle Onassis?

151
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:21,015
I heard that. The two of them
used my legs for a wishbone.

152
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,104
Nearly snapped my butt in half.

153
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:25,314
- Yeah, they owe you.
- No, you owe me!

154
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,649
- Ah. Uh, I'll get you tomorrow.
- All right.

155
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,485
- Peace.
- You too! Take it easy, Flip.

156
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:32,571
Ho! Ho! All right, all right. Yeah!

157
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,327
Seventy-three, 74...

158
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:23,084
seventy-five, 76, 77, 78...

159
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,541
seventy-nine, 80, 81.

160
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,876
Okay, right.

161
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,125
Not bad, 1:31.

162
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,385
Good, good. I can do that
a couple more times.

163
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,420
Maybe four times if I have to.

164
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,591
Somebody's growing a garden on
the roof. Ripe for the picking.

165
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,350
Yeah, that's it. Health food.

166
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:43,973
That's disgusting! What is that?
You really don't need it.

167
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,725
I didn't leave this open.

168
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:50,316
Somebody's been up here. Oh, I'm
not the only one with a key.

169
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,752
Right where I left you.

170
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,806
Yuck. Return to sender.

171
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:06,138
Disgusting.

172
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:22,133
- Jerry, keys.
- What? What?

173
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:29,053
How come this is safe for me,
but not for the keys?

174
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:41,231
- Smart girl.
- How's that, Jer?

175
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:44,193
Justice. She's wearing a blindfold.

176
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:50,991
- Jerry.
- What?

177
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,193
- You have an appointment?
- Sure, naturally.

178
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:56,501
- Okay, can you show us a slip?
- I'm not wearing one. Ha-ha-ha!

179
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:02,499
- Good morning, Claudia.
- Good morning, sir. This is what you wanted.

180
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:05,293
- And, uh, your coffee's on your desk.
- Okay, thank you.

181
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:06,927
People, give me this room.

182
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:11,098
Not you, Miss Sutton. You stay.

183
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:17,601
This is a request from
you for 18 wiretaps...

184
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:22,769
on the Ezekiel Walters case, a case
that we are no longer investigating.

185
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,608
I've been doing it
in my spare time.

186
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,944
This is the Justice Department,
not Alice Sutton, P.I.

187
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:31,031
Walters is sewing a life
sentence on the bank bombing.

188
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:34,367
Until we get new evidence,
this case is closed.

189
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:38,789
Do you know what it's like, Mr. Wilson,
to think you know what happened...

190
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,953
but to never be sure?

191
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:44,712
I've been here 20 years, Alice.
I know what it's like.

192
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:50,930
Until you've investigated your own
father's murder, you have no idea.

193
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,341
Alice Sutton knows me.

194
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,976
- It will not be a surprise.
- You're making it hard.

195
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,229
<i>Ms. Sutton's psychotic
is here again.</i>

196
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,606
Claudia, I want him out
of here right now.

197
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:03,564
I have a right!
I am an American citizen!

198
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:07,230
- And I demand to see Alice Sutton!
- Please, you have to...

199
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,069
Shit.

200
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,905
Man, this guy is a restraining
order waiting to happen.

201
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:13,411
I... Can I see Alice Sutton?

202
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,571
No, he can't. He has to
have an appointment.

203
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:18,036
I have a right to be here.
She'll tell you that.

204
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:20,076
- Get him out of here.
- Thank you.

205
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,870
What? She can't... I haven't
done anything wrong!

206
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:25,131
Officers! Officers,
I'll take him from here.

207
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,712
I'm Alice Sutton. Sorry.

208
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,222
Hi, Alice.

209
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:39,228
You need to start
making appointments.

210
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:44,109
Uh, can I make one now? In a couple
minutes? I can wait if you're busy.

211
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:46,936
Come around.

212
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,616
- I don't see the connection.
- You don't?

213
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:56,120
Oh, come on. Six major earthquakes in three
and a half years and the space shuttle...

214
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:59,327
up in orbit for every one. Don't
you think that's strange?

215
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,618
Testing some top-secret
seismic weapon?

216
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:05,209
No! No. Not testing. Using.
Nukes are passe. We're...

217
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:06,773
We're talking weapon of the future.

218
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,401
I don't see what it has
to do with the president.

219
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,965
The president's in Europe...
Hi. Europe at the moment.

220
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:14,472
And, uh, tomorrow he'll be, uh...

221
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,679
in Turkey, right here
along this fault line.

222
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:20,265
And they sent up a space
shuttle yesterday.

223
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:22,430
- Motive?
- Motive?

224
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:25,019
How about $50 billion?
How's that for a motive?

225
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:28,728
Oh. Oh, here, let me get that.

226
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:33,320
The president's cutting funding to NASA,
the milk cow of the aerospace industry.

227
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:38,158
So you're telling me that NASA's going to
kill the president with an earthquake?

228
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:41,199
- Do you still ride?
- Not for years.

229
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:44,369
Why do you keep the picture of you?
Kind of wish you hadn't quit?

230
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:46,537
- Jerry. The earthquake.
- What? Oh.

231
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:48,672
Not exactly the kind of thing...

232
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:51,431
a Secret Service agent can just
throw himself on top of, is it?

233
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,596
- Mr. Wilson needs you in his office.
- Thank you.

234
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,262
Does she always just
burst in like that?

235
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:01,974
Yes, Jerry, that's her job.
Now I have to go.

236
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:03,979
My boss is looking to yell at me.

237
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:06,857
Do you want me to talk to him,
smooth things out for you?

238
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:10,020
No, I want you to go home or
wherever it is that you go.

239
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:13,486
And I want you to make an appointment.
You can't just keep bursting in.

240
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,783
No, no. It's just what
they'd be expecting.

241
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,069
- If I make an appointment, they...
- Jerry.

242
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:22,956
I have a serious job here.
I have a boss I must answer to.

243
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,663
Do you understand that?

244
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:29,914
I'm sorry. You're right.

245
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,548
- Use your common sense.
- Okay.

246
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,835
Okay, deal. So are
you gonna warn him?

247
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,719
Who?

248
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:37,630
The president.

249
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,553
I'm not gonna promise you anything.

250
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,395
You think I'm crazy.
She thinks I'm crazy.

251
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,976
No. No, Jerry, I think
you're different.

252
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,268
Well, you know, to be
normal in the real world...

253
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,857
and to, you know, drink
Coca-Cola and eat...

254
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,398
- Jerry.
- Sorry. Eat Kentucky Fried Chicken...

255
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:58,613
you got to be in a
conspiracy against yourself.

256
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:03,205
Do you wanna go out sometime?

257
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,503
No.

258
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,130
Okay. Okay. Ahem.

259
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,132
So, what's...? What's
your horse's name?

260
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,257
Johnny Dancer.

261
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:21,758
You've been in my office a dozen
times, you never asked that before.

262
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:25,269
Um, I was waiting till
I got to know you better.

263
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:30,850
- Ahem, uh...
- Ahem.

264
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,986
I'd say eight, actually...

265
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:35,487
times.

266
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:39,776
Times I've been here. Eight.

267
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:56,421
Hey! Hey, pal!

268
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,636
Don't these water mains
usually go in the wintertime?

269
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:02,389
Hey, pal, all I know is
it's <i>beaucoup</i> overtime.

270
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:04,141
Yeah.

271
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:17,479
Feds.

272
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,068
No, not Feds.

273
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,658
These guys got a purpose.

274
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,819
Car has government plates.
Government plates.

275
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:26,326
There's something
fishy going on here.

276
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:28,999
Yeah. Yeah. Bet my balls.

277
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:32,253
Oh, here they come. Camera!

278
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,480
Sir, he's in the building now.

279
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:45,906
Spooks. I knew it.

280
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:49,906
Yes, sir.

281
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:15,455
Surprise must count for something.
You guys are good.

282
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:17,474
You fellas been
watching me a while?

283
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:20,064
I've been told I have eyes
in the back of my head...

284
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:23,822
but I didn't even see you guys
coming, you know? I just...

285
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:26,860
You must be spooks, huh? Spooks?

286
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:28,778
CIA spooks, right?

287
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,070
Say something, will you?

288
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:36,376
I was right.

289
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,208
What was...?
What was I right about?

290
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:43,293
I wasn't right about... No, I wasn't right.
I was wrong. I was wrong! I was...

291
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:47,759
You guys are from NASA! That's right!
You're from NASA! No! Come on!

292
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,013
No, not the eyes!

293
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,640
God! Unh!

294
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:11,988
What?

295
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:17,410
We've been looking for
you a long time, Jerry.

296
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,375
Do I know you?

297
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:22,915
Very well.

298
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,252
Jerry...

299
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:28,674
have you ever...

300
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:32,182
been in a place from
which hope was gone?

301
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:35,015
Where all that's left...

302
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:36,975
is patience?

303
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:43,519
Now, Jerry...

304
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:46,902
to whom have you been talking?

305
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:51,368
I... I... I talk to lots of people.
I drive a cab, you know?

306
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:54,906
- I meet people all day.
- Who else knows what we know?

307
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:58,701
What?

308
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:00,870
What we know, Jerry.

309
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,504
What?

310
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:06,292
Tell me what! What do we know?

311
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:09,712
If I know what we know, then
I could tell you what we know...

312
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,677
and if someone else knows, okay?
I mean, it's just...

313
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,263
You got to be more specific.

314
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:27,900
What...? What is that?

315
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:32,155
Gravy for the brain.

316
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:35,405
No! Not gravy!

317
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:39,075
Please! Please! Please!

318
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:43,083
Not gravy. No, not gravy!
No! God, no.

319
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:45,919
Don't do this to me, please!

320
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:53,221
Now, Jerry...

321
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,178
to whom have you been talking?

322
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,434
No, I've had gravy!

323
00:27:57,593 --> 00:27:59,971
I've had gravy.

324
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:03,314
- I know you!
- Yes. Now you...

325
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:05,896
- You know now, Jerry. Now you know.
- Unh!

326
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,983
- I don't know! Help me!
- Who else knows, Jerry?

327
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:10,363
Who else knows, Jerry?

328
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,320
- Who knows?
- Help me!

329
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:15,201
What do you know? Who
have you been talking to?

330
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,328
Help! Help!

331
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:26,372
I know I must share some
of the blame for this.

332
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:30,296
I wish it didn't
have to be this way.

333
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,759
Jerry, to whom have
you been talking?

334
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,813
Who else knows? Who else knows?

335
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:44,936
Jerry!

336
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,197
I believe.

337
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,659
I believe! I believe!

338
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,444
Agh!

339
00:28:57,611 --> 00:28:59,204
- Who else knows?
- I don't know.

340
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:01,365
Who else knows, Jerry?

341
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:03,283
- Names, Jerry, names!
- I don't know!

342
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,418
- I don't want to dance!
- Who else knows?

343
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,796
To whom have you been talking?

344
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:24,145
Aah! Aah! Now he knows!

345
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:26,056
Now he knows!

346
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:43,217
He's flying! He's flying!

347
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:09,223
You wouldn't do this
if you knew! Alice!

348
00:32:09,386 --> 00:32:11,730
I want to see Alice Sutton!
There she is.

349
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:14,107
There she is. Alice! Alice!
I don't know...

350
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:16,815
Alice, this is it! This is it!
They tried to...

351
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:21,107
I don't know what they
tried, but I know...

352
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:23,617
I don't know what I know,
but I know that it's big.

353
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:28,531
And they just... Will you let me talk?
Look, get back, all right?

354
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:30,950
- Calm down!
- Cut it out, will you?

355
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:35,295
Get back. Please, just
give me that gun.

356
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:38,003
- And roll it over here.
- All right, all right!

357
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:43,216
- Will you get back? Will you get back? Alice.
- All right.

358
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:46,348
- I need to talk to you.
- You want to talk to me? Here I am.

359
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:49,851
- I was... In a wheelchair... No, I was...
- Take it easy. Okay.

360
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:52,104
- Will you get back!
- Okay.

361
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:56,358
Alice, I have to tell
you something. I...

362
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:58,985
Why don't you just take it easy?

363
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:02,694
Take it real easy with that, okay?
Just take it real easy.

364
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,446
Jerry, you have blood
on your shirt.

365
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:08,366
Oh.

366
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:11,873
I bit his nose off!
I bit his nose off! I bit...

367
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:14,785
- You bit somebody's nose off?
- Agh.

368
00:33:15,202 --> 00:33:19,002
Don't get into this thing where you
make me repeat myself. I hate that.

369
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:20,882
- Okay. I'm sorry.
- Get back...

370
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:23,260
you dumb complicit sons of bitches!

371
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:27,013
You're looking for a man with
no nose, not me! Not me.

372
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:29,721
- I need to tell you there was...
- Jerry, look at me.

373
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:31,226
Tank. Fishtank. Goldfish, no.

374
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:34,137
- And I was in the belly of a whale.
- Just calm down.

375
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:36,272
No! Wheel...! I was crippled and...

376
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:39,150
Look at me. I want you to
put the gun down, please.

377
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:42,483
No, there was a goldfish. There
wasn't any gravy and I...

378
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:43,989
- Jerry. Jerry.
- I...

379
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,990
I don't know what to...

380
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:47,275
Just put the gun down.

381
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:52,581
I'm so... I'm sorry.

382
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,412
It's okay. It's okay.

383
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,668
I'm sorry.

384
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,162
Okay? Perfect.

385
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:02,173
- Agh!
- Hey! Take it easy! Take it easy!

386
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:05,085
- Unh!
- Jesus. My God, Jerry, you're bleeding.

387
00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:07,175
Call an ambulance.
Call an ambulance!

388
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:09,590
A piece of a wheelchair
poked through me.

389
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:12,100
- Christ.
- Back away! Back away!

390
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:14,353
Put it away!

391
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:16,980
- Oh, Christ!
- Tell me what happened.

392
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:19,015
I can't.

393
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:23,895
I can't remember.

394
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,941
I can't remember them.
I can't remember me.

395
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:29,576
I... I can remember you.

396
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:31,828
I remember you.

397
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,828
It's on the tip of my tongue.

398
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,496
I'll remember in the
morning. Remem...

399
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:43,631
I'm just tired.

400
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:48,257
I just need some sleep.

401
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:57,762
Open.

402
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:03,894
Open, please.

403
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,273
She's for you.

404
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:11,493
No, nurse. No, don't! Don't!

405
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:14,450
What is it? What is it?
I told them...

406
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:16,707
- No, what is it?
- Something to help you sleep.

407
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:19,664
I don't... Agh! I don't want
to sleep, I want to check out.

408
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:23,706
Why am I handcuffed to this bed?
I'm not a criminal. Please, help!

409
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:27,046
Alice, you gotta get me out of here.
They gave me some stuff.

410
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,302
- You're under arrest.
- What?

411
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:31,304
What's...? What's the charge?

412
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:33,807
- Jerry, you were there. Figure it out.
- Oh, Jesus.

413
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,468
If you remember who stabbed
you with the wheelchair...

414
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:39,388
- ...or where it happened, it would help.
- Wheelchair, right.

415
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:43,479
I was in the... Oh, God, I wish I could
explain it so it all made sense.

416
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:47,112
- It's all right. Just relax.
- Alice. Alice.

417
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,022
You got to switch the charts.

418
00:35:49,189 --> 00:35:52,318
Switch my charts with that guy's
charts. You gotta switch them.

419
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:56,830
Don't make me repeat myself. Please,
switch my chart or I'll be dead by morning.

420
00:35:56,988 --> 00:36:00,413
- I swear.
- Relax. Go to sleep. I'll see you tomorrow.

421
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,998
- You want to bet?
- You're just being paranoid.

422
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,004
Only paranoid because
they want me dead.

423
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:08,087
Please, Alice.
Please, save my life.

424
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:10,552
Switch... Switch them.

425
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:14,339
Switch the charts.

426
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:52,593
Could you open this,
please, ma'am? Ma'am?

427
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,798
- What happened?
- Guy came in with a stab wound...

428
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:59,218
and died of a heart attack.
Go figure.

429
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:04,689
- You Miss Sutton?
- Yes.

430
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:07,271
They want me to bring
you downstairs.

431
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:08,731
Who does?

432
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:12,898
The FBI, the CIA. You name the
initials, they're down there.

433
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,907
Any special reason?

434
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,615
They said to bring you and
the body to the basement.

435
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:20,280
And the body's on its
way, so come with me.

436
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:21,915
Uh...

437
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:24,208
I just need one minute, please.

438
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:37,050
Thank you.

439
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,183
For what?

440
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,848
For switching the charts.

441
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:45,977
I didn't switch the charts.

442
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:50,815
No, it's okay. The guy, he traded bullets
with an old man in a liquor store.

443
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,524
He had it coming.

444
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:55,987
You expect me to believe that
someone came in here last night...

445
00:37:56,149 --> 00:37:58,652
and gave that guy something
that stopped his heart?

446
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:01,742
You switched the
charts, you tell me.

447
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,378
I've got to go downstairs, now.

448
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:11,631
- The CIA wants to see your body.
- Really?

449
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,799
I won't be here when you
get back. I'll keep in touch.

450
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,510
You're handcuffed
to the bed, Jerry.

451
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:24,098
I guess I'll have to chew through my arm.
It's better than hospital food.

452
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:27,556
Thank you.

453
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:33,857
You saved my life. Thank you.

454
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,529
Heart attacks happen.

455
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:43,242
I didn't switch the charts.

456
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:46,408
Yeah, you did.

457
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:50,124
You switched them.
You switched the charts.

458
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:55,629
Let's see here. This is
a grueling experience.

459
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,258
Put that out!

460
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:06,644
Here's a government man now.
Uh, this is Miss Sutton.

461
00:39:06,803 --> 00:39:09,431
Miss Sutton, Agent Lowry, FBI.

462
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:12,441
Uh, we're waiting for jurisdictional
problems to be cleared.

463
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,103
- This guy Fletcher's something else.
- Tell me about it.

464
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:18,399
Police want him for assault.
Secret Service for counterfeiting.

465
00:39:18,565 --> 00:39:20,988
We're tracking him on a
string of bank robberies.

466
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,699
No one knows what the
CIA wants him for.

467
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:28,700
This guy's a CIA shrink,
he's here to ID Fletcher.

468
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:32,121
- They knew each other somehow.
- Take off the sheet.

469
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:36,837
- This isn't him.
- Says "Jerry Fletcher" on the chart.

470
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,002
- Alice.
- Uh...

471
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:41,304
Uh, Jerry's...

472
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:44,307
- He's...
- He's what?

473
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:50,226
He's having a heart attack!

474
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:53,649
- Where's that goddamn cop?
- Agh! Unh!

475
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,651
Get a crash cart in here, stat!

476
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,779
<i>Dr. Hamilton, Code Blue.</i>

477
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:00,565
<i>Dr. Hamilton, Code Blue.</i>

478
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:03,451
- A dog bit it.
- Excuse me?

479
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:08,411
You were going to ask about my nose.
Poor animal is slated to be destroyed today.

480
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:11,577
- And you feel bad for it?
- It's my dog.

481
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:16,297
Oh, no! I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

482
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:18,879
Nurse. Nurse! Aah!

483
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:20,510
There he goes!

484
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:24,889
- Open the goddamn gate!
- No, and you watch your language!

485
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:28,267
- Hey!
- FBI, lady! Open the damn door!

486
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:41,814
Hi, Alice.

487
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:44,151
You never saw me.

488
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:49,997
Shut up! There he goes!

489
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:53,243
Lady, open the damn door!

490
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:56,913
- Open the gate! Will you open it?
- Open it!

491
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,093
You! Get hospital security.

492
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:05,926
- Block all exits.
- Yes sir. Let's go!

493
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:08,638
Is this guy a psychiatrist
or a field agent?

494
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:31,201
You want to put your foot
down and get out of there?

495
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:33,332
Ugh. Come on, buddy.

496
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:36,745
Look, if you only knew what
really happened to Serpico...

497
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:38,913
you'd be helping me out right now.

498
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,127
Get out of there!

499
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,585
Come on, now!

500
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:45,799
Give me a break. I'm wounded.

501
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:47,259
Hands behind your back.

502
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,636
Sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

503
00:41:58,725 --> 00:42:00,477
Agh! Unh.

504
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:23,875
He said a dog bit his nose.

505
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:25,881
Oh. Arf.

506
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:29,471
Please. You got to help me
out of this, Alice, please.

507
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,257
I can't make any promises.

508
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:34,974
I'm in a tight spot here.
Please, Alice.

509
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:37,851
You look really pretty today.

510
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,684
Your eyes look kind
of different. Oh, God.

511
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:43,228
Please, Alice, make
an exception. Alice?

512
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:47,194
Alice. Alice. Alice. Alice!

513
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:49,984
Please. Alice,
are you there? Please!

514
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:52,324
Come back. Please,
don't leave me here.

515
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:54,660
Alice. Alice. Alice!

516
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:56,620
Oh, unh.

517
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:58,285
Thank you.

518
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:00,335
There we go.

519
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,192
Have you seen him?

520
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:31,030
- No. Did you see him?
- No way we can shut a place quick enough.

521
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:35,743
You have a half-naked man chained
to a bed rail. Just block all the exits.

522
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:38,495
- That's a good idea.
- Um...

523
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:40,752
Will you keep me company, please?

524
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:01,393
- David?
- Uh, Carl.

525
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:05,402
I'm sorry, Carl. Of course. Dr. Fine.
I want your advice about something.

526
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:09,315
I had a middle-aged guy,
operating on him, gallstones...

527
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:13,530
- Do I know you?
- Of course. Dr. Fine, Proctology.

528
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:18,415
So Jerry thinks that NASA is
plotting to kill the president?

529
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:20,120
You've already asked me that.

530
00:44:20,283 --> 00:44:22,877
And you have no idea
where Jerry lives?

531
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:27,006
You've asked me that three times. Why
do you keep making me repeat myself?

532
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:28,883
All right, here's a fresh one.

533
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:30,422
Over here.

534
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:32,007
Why you?

535
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:36,550
Your colleague, Mr. Wilson, tells me
Jerry won't talk to anyone but you.

536
00:44:36,716 --> 00:44:38,969
That seems, um...

537
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:42,685
oddly possessive behavior to me.

538
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:44,724
I'm sorry, what was the question?

539
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:47,943
Why do you insist on
having me repeat myself?

540
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:52,236
Why...

541
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:53,570
you?

542
00:44:57,612 --> 00:44:59,080
I think he has a crush on me.

543
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:01,119
How charming.

544
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:02,996
He has great taste.

545
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:04,994
Now, why him?

546
00:45:05,161 --> 00:45:08,335
Why do you, uh, tolerate
his visits to your office?

547
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:15,131
About six months ago, I was leaving
work and two guys tried to mug me.

548
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:19,058
Jerry came out of nowhere and
rescued me. That's how I met him.

549
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:25,932
He probably is crazy, but there's
something about Jerry that...

550
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,442
just...

551
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:31,441
I don't know.

552
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,983
I guess I don't have the heart
to tell him to get lost.

553
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:37,402
I didn't know the CIA
had psychiatrists.

554
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:40,579
We're very specialized.

555
00:45:42,365 --> 00:45:43,787
May I?

556
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:49,922
<i>Veritas.</i>

557
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:51,707
Truth.

558
00:45:53,376 --> 00:45:55,378
What is it they say about truth?

559
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:58,222
The truth will set you free.

560
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,684
Thank you.

561
00:46:31,998 --> 00:46:33,500
"Catcher in the Rye."

562
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:37,592
That's the book Chapman had on
him when he shot John Lennon.

563
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:39,471
I was just thinking that.

564
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:42,683
Remember the guy that
shot Reagan? John Hinckley?

565
00:46:42,842 --> 00:46:45,516
I read they found a copy of
that book in his apartment.

566
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:50,812
Weird coincidence, huh?

567
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:53,811
Thanks for your input, officer.

568
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:58,073
Unh. Gum...

569
00:46:58,232 --> 00:46:59,905
keys...

570
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:01,735
and a book.

571
00:47:03,112 --> 00:47:04,284
Hmm.

572
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,032
Car.

573
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:08,409
Maybe apartment.

574
00:47:08,743 --> 00:47:10,165
But, uh...

575
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:11,921
this in an odd one.

576
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,252
What do you think?
It's got paint on it.

577
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:18,969
Safety deposit box key.

578
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:21,509
I'll take that.

579
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,299
And that.

580
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:29,305
You're welcome.

581
00:47:30,139 --> 00:47:31,436
Spooks.

582
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:36,525
So, what do you say we, um...

583
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:40,028
I don't know, compare
notes on this guy?

584
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:48,657
"Geronimo"?

585
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:59,218
- No, don't! Don't!
- Let me have the ticket.

586
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:02,301
No, I'm here, I'm here,
I'm here! Oh, God.

587
00:48:02,463 --> 00:48:05,842
- There's a "no parking" sign there.
- Yeah, I see it. Yeah, yeah.

588
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:10,104
- Two cops to give a ticket now? Great.
- These days it takes two cops.

589
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:23,818
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God.
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to frighten you.

590
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:26,612
Tickets have been coming all day.
Didn't know what to do.

591
00:48:26,779 --> 00:48:30,534
- How'd you know this was my car?
- I didn't. It was a lucky guess.

592
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:33,498
Look, I feel kind of naked.
Could we get out of here?

593
00:48:33,661 --> 00:48:37,757
- Please don't tell me you're naked.
- It's a figure of speech. Can we go?

594
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:39,792
- Please. Hurry.
- Yeah, okay.

595
00:48:39,959 --> 00:48:42,303
People are looking
everywhere for the...

596
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:53,731
What took you so long?
I was here all day.

597
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:57,735
That's how long it takes to turn a hospital
inside-out. There are people after you.

598
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:02,740
They'll put me in the same place as
Oswald. Another lunatic acting alone.

599
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:06,660
Oswald killed the president. Is
that what you're planning to do?

600
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:09,038
No. Did you call him about
the earthquake thing?

601
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,413
- Warn him?
- I'll do that.

602
00:49:10,573 --> 00:49:14,874
- Can you sit up so I can see you?
- No. No. I don't want them to see me.

603
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:17,129
- Them who?
- Them back there.

604
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:20,087
Look. Change lanes.
Watch the rear-view mirror.

605
00:49:20,249 --> 00:49:22,126
It's a fun experiment.

606
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:40,895
- Did you see it? Wraparound headlights?
- Yeah.

607
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:43,780
Crown Victoria? FBI.
It's a legitimate tail.

608
00:49:45,024 --> 00:49:46,196
As opposed to?

609
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:49,495
As opposed to people more
serious about their work.

610
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:53,874
Can you drive this thing, or do
you just like looking good in it?

611
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:55,876
I suppose you think
I should speed up...

612
00:49:56,035 --> 00:49:58,129
- ...and try to lose them?
- Yes.

613
00:49:58,287 --> 00:50:00,460
It's what a man would do.
I'm not a man.

614
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:03,796
I noticed. Hey, what...?
What are you doing?

615
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:06,132
What are you doing? What?
What are you doing?

616
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:07,884
Oh, man.

617
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:19,899
Agent Lowry.

618
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:22,395
It wasn't my idea.

619
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:23,858
Jonas?

620
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:27,233
It's his show for now.

621
00:50:29,068 --> 00:50:30,661
Look, you want to get some dinner?

622
00:50:32,321 --> 00:50:34,289
Interagency cooperation and all?

623
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:39,003
When I'm ready to compare
notes, I'll let you know.

624
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:40,375
It's your call.

625
00:50:41,497 --> 00:50:42,498
Have a good night.

626
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:52,262
See? Wasn't that a lot easier than squealing
tires and knocking over trash cans?

627
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:53,892
Nothing's easy.

628
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:57,851
- You know that guy they arrested in...
- How long have we known each other?

629
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:02,939
Six months and 11 days. Um...

630
00:51:03,352 --> 00:51:05,480
Six months and 11 days?

631
00:51:06,105 --> 00:51:08,199
All right, I'll give
you one more hour.

632
00:51:08,357 --> 00:51:09,483
Where to?

633
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:21,328
Why did we have to go
down to go back up?

634
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:22,712
Shh, shh, shh.

635
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:24,464
Because...

636
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:28,469
Because it's, uh... I don't like to
come and go the same way twice.

637
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:31,722
I just live in there.
I have to get...

638
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,507
Get... Unh.

639
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:38,891
Okay.

640
00:51:41,015 --> 00:51:42,483
Here.

641
00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:45,486
- You should have this.
- What is it?

642
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:48,523
It's my union pin. I figured,
the way you drove...

643
00:51:48,689 --> 00:51:51,863
you should be in the union.

644
00:51:52,401 --> 00:51:56,201
I'd be proud to have you
drive me around in a cab.

645
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,457
Come in, please.

646
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:02,878
Give me those.
I'll put them up. Unh.

647
00:52:03,037 --> 00:52:05,756
Let me shut the door. Sorry
there's not more room in here.

648
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:07,791
My keys.

649
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:09,710
I'll just get the light.

650
00:52:15,007 --> 00:52:16,600
The Jerry Garcia file.

651
00:52:16,759 --> 00:52:19,057
I didn't... Oh, yeah. Yes, I did.

652
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:21,722
You know why The Grateful
Dead are always on tour?

653
00:52:21,889 --> 00:52:22,981
- No.
- Yeah?

654
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:26,360
You know why? Because they're all
British agents, intelligence agents.

655
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:28,236
They're spies.

656
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:32,821
Jerry Garcia himself has a double-0
rating, just like James Bond.

657
00:52:33,442 --> 00:52:34,944
Jerry Garcia's dead.

658
00:52:36,362 --> 00:52:39,081
That's what they want
you to think. Unh.

659
00:52:39,448 --> 00:52:42,668
Is this supposed to protect
you from aliens or something?

660
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:44,794
No, it's just a beer bottle.

661
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:46,580
Follow me.

662
00:52:46,747 --> 00:52:48,590
Come into my humble abode.

663
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:50,880
Here we go.

664
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:55,718
Welcome.

665
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:00,723
Would you like something to drink?

666
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:02,429
Coffee...

667
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:04,223
if that's okay.

668
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:06,563
Oh, no, coffee's our friend.

669
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:09,604
Coffee's our friend. It's fine.

670
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:27,630
I keep the beans in the fridge. Keeps
them fresher, makes better coffee.

671
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:31,751
Old Italian guy, Papa
Leoni told me that.

672
00:53:32,418 --> 00:53:34,216
He's dead now. Nice old guy.

673
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:38,552
The hell?

674
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:49,818
"I love the delicate shadow..."

675
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:53,151
of she...

676
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:55,657
- "wanting me to be."
- Gah, uh...

677
00:53:55,816 --> 00:54:00,538
Yeah, I can't seem to remember this
combination. Want some juice instead?

678
00:54:00,696 --> 00:54:02,073
Sure.

679
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:26,890
Oh, you know, if my
universe had a hub...

680
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:29,934
- This would be it?
- Yeah.

681
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:31,731
Here.

682
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:34,313
"In the Irons"?

683
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:38,110
Yeah, I've been reading
up on it lately. Equitation.

684
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:39,743
- You know.
- Are these yours?

685
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,492
Yes.

686
00:54:45,741 --> 00:54:48,569
But this, I think this is what's
been causing the problem.

687
00:54:48,595 --> 00:54:50,272
This is the third issue this year.

688
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:52,881
"Conspiracy Theory." I give
you "Conspiracy Theory."

689
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:55,675
This is my newsletter.

690
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:57,802
I think it's got them scared.

691
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:01,181
You know? I must have hit a nerve
with one of those articles in there.

692
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:04,765
Otherwise... They're pretty pissed
off about something. That's...

693
00:55:04,927 --> 00:55:08,056
"The Space Shuttle's
Seismic Secret"?

694
00:55:09,515 --> 00:55:12,519
"The Oliver Stone-George Bush
Connection"? Oliver Stone?

695
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:16,689
Oh, oh yeah. Sure. I mean,
he's their spokesman.

696
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:21,865
Yeah! You think if anyone had the
information that he's got...

697
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:25,702
and had a national podium to shout
it from, they'd actually let him do it?

698
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:29,585
No, it's quite clear that he's a
disinformation junkie for him.

699
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:34,165
The fact that he's still alive
says it all. He should be dead.

700
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:38,176
- Can you prove any of this?
- Heh.

701
00:55:39,211 --> 00:55:44,684
No. Absolutely not. A good conspiracy
is, um, an unprovable one.

702
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:50,765
If you can prove it, they screwed
up somewhere along the line.

703
00:55:50,931 --> 00:55:53,525
- And if that's the case...
- They?

704
00:55:53,684 --> 00:55:55,778
They! Yeah.

705
00:55:56,812 --> 00:55:58,906
- They who?
- They?

706
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:02,868
They? I... I don't know.

707
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:07,031
That's why they call them "they."
And "them." You know?

708
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:09,791
Where does Jonas fit in?

709
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:14,456
He's one of "they." He's one of them.
He's them. I mean, for sure.

710
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:17,420
- They. Them.
- Them.

711
00:56:18,834 --> 00:56:21,178
Suppose they have a
secret handshake.

712
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:40,314
- That's it?
- Ha, ha.

713
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,654
No. How would I know?
I'm not one of them.

714
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:45,819
I'm just horsing around.

715
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:52,334
- How many subscribers do you have?
- Well, let's see.

716
00:56:55,454 --> 00:56:57,502
Uh, five.

717
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:02,594
But I think it's probably got
something to do with the economy.

718
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:07,216
You think one of them
is not who they seem?

719
00:57:08,467 --> 00:57:10,344
You think it might be one of they?

720
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:13,768
That could be. Oh! Of course!

721
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:16,901
- You have a list?
- Huh?

722
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:19,061
- A subscriber's list?
- Oh!

723
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:21,571
Yes, right over here.

724
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:26,944
I thought you meant
some other kind of...

725
00:57:33,742 --> 00:57:35,710
Big Holden Caulfield fan?

726
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:42,713
No.

727
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:44,173
Not really.

728
00:57:44,336 --> 00:57:46,088
You just like the story?

729
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,268
- Not especially, no.
- Well, Jerry...

730
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:55,055
you've got a dozen
copies of this book.

731
00:57:56,098 --> 00:57:57,475
I know.

732
00:57:58,266 --> 00:58:00,314
Yeah, I know. I know, I...

733
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:05,441
There's more of them in here.

734
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:06,824
And, uh...

735
00:58:07,693 --> 00:58:09,570
Under the bed too.

736
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:13,911
I don't know why, but
whenever I see one...

737
00:58:14,074 --> 00:58:16,168
I have to buy it.

738
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:19,921
And if I don't see one...

739
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,128
well, then I have to find one...

740
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:23,667
to buy...

741
00:58:23,834 --> 00:58:26,007
so that I can feel normal.

742
00:58:30,424 --> 00:58:34,099
I... I don't know why. Ahem.

743
00:58:34,261 --> 00:58:36,764
Did you ever read it?

744
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:41,648
Um, yeah, you read this in school.

745
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:44,484
No one ever gave it to
me to read at school.

746
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:46,990
That's what they start
when you're young.

747
00:58:47,149 --> 00:58:51,575
When you're little, at school, they
Baden-Powell all the boys and...

748
00:58:51,737 --> 00:58:54,331
and they Betty Crocker
all the girls.

749
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:56,162
Then they air condition you.

750
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:59,919
And they put you in an Easy Bake
Oven and you can't breathe anymore.

751
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:02,331
Oh, Jesus.

752
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:04,090
You must think I'm crazy, huh?

753
00:59:06,168 --> 00:59:08,170
Yeah, right.

754
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:13,016
Four, twenty-three...

755
00:59:13,175 --> 00:59:14,677
twelve.

756
00:59:16,178 --> 00:59:17,771
That's, uh...

757
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:22,105
That's the combination of the coffee.
Do you still want some?

758
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,909
Ugh, you idiot.

759
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:38,579
We're made. Gas them.

760
00:59:42,454 --> 00:59:44,047
Go! Tear gas!

761
00:59:44,206 --> 00:59:46,334
Don't breathe! Don't breathe!

762
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:52,639
<i>- Delta team, are you secure?
- Delta team, secure.</i>

763
00:59:57,219 --> 00:59:59,267
- Ready?
- Take it down!

764
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:07,942
Concussion grenade. Clear!

765
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:11,984
- Get on the bed! Stay down!
- Aah!

766
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:18,578
Unh! Move it! Come on! Come on.

767
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:26,332
- What are you doing? Oh, God.
- Get down. There's a ladder.

768
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:36,808
- Are you coming?
- I'm right behind you.

769
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:47,151
- Close your eyes.
- Aah! What are you doing?

770
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:49,400
I'm torching my hub!

771
01:01:09,624 --> 01:01:11,046
What is that?

772
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:13,382
Uh, that was here when I moved in.

773
01:01:29,311 --> 01:01:31,860
- What are you doing?
- Always be prepared.

774
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:37,819
Get out now! Go, go, go!

775
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:48,080
The fire's two flights
up on the left.

776
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:50,749
Excuse me. Excuse me!

777
01:01:50,916 --> 01:01:52,338
Clear a path.

778
01:01:53,335 --> 01:01:55,303
- Was that who I think it was?
- Yup.

779
01:01:55,462 --> 01:01:57,430
- Has this ever happened before?
- No.

780
01:01:57,589 --> 01:01:59,762
- No, but I've been practicing. Let's go.
- Jerry!

781
01:01:59,925 --> 01:02:01,552
- What?
- Who are you?

782
01:02:03,178 --> 01:02:05,601
I'm just a guy trying
to put out a fire.

783
01:02:06,056 --> 01:02:08,024
Come on, let's go.

784
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:12,362
See this aluminum-looking
stuff? It's fire wall.

785
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:17,568
It's amazing. The guy designed this
place so it could be an incinerator...

786
01:02:17,859 --> 01:02:20,328
but it leaves the rest of
the building untouched.

787
01:02:21,071 --> 01:02:24,075
Dr. Jonas. Dr. Jonas!

788
01:02:24,532 --> 01:02:26,455
Something else here you should see.

789
01:02:26,618 --> 01:02:28,416
I want to hear more.

790
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:31,331
Let's go. Wrap it up. Let's go.

791
01:02:34,209 --> 01:02:35,836
Do you mind?

792
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:01,490
In one hour, I want to
know what she eats...

793
01:03:01,653 --> 01:03:05,453
where she sleeps, the name of her
kindergarten teacher. Everything.

794
01:03:07,951 --> 01:03:10,545
- See? Home, safe and sound.
- No, it only looks safe.

795
01:03:10,704 --> 01:03:13,127
- You can't stay here.
- They're not after me!

796
01:03:13,415 --> 01:03:15,509
Don't turn the lights on.

797
01:03:15,667 --> 01:03:18,546
Look, I can stay here with you,
I can sleep on your couch.

798
01:03:18,712 --> 01:03:21,135
- Don't turn the lights on.
- No. You're going, okay?

799
01:03:21,298 --> 01:03:23,096
- I don't want to go.
- No. You're going!

800
01:03:23,258 --> 01:03:24,851
I want to ask you something.

801
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:27,058
Ask me to stay. I could
sleep in the bathtub.

802
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:30,190
- Jerry, no! Shut up.
- You shouldn't be here alone.

803
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:32,100
- Get down.
- Jerry, I...

804
01:03:33,101 --> 01:03:34,444
What are you doing now?

805
01:03:34,602 --> 01:03:38,152
You don't want to be seen here.
Always make sure these are shut.

806
01:03:38,315 --> 01:03:41,694
Please, just be still, be quiet.
Listen to me, okay?

807
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:43,954
I think we can make
some progress...

808
01:03:44,112 --> 01:03:48,333
if you just answer one
question to my satisfaction.

809
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:49,959
I'll try.

810
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:54,623
It's about the painting on
the wall in your apartment.

811
01:03:56,291 --> 01:04:00,467
I didn't mean for you to see that.
That's like looking in someone's diary...

812
01:04:00,628 --> 01:04:04,599
- and taking it all out of context, you know.
- Okay. Okay.

813
01:04:04,758 --> 01:04:07,853
That's fair. It's just that...

814
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:13,984
well, Jerry, it was so big and you obviously
put a lot of time into it and you seem to...

815
01:04:14,142 --> 01:04:17,271
know me so well.
How is that possible?

816
01:04:18,146 --> 01:04:19,898
So, what's the question?

817
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:22,609
How is that possible?

818
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:27,451
This is you and your dad. He was...

819
01:04:27,614 --> 01:04:30,788
murdered, wasn't he? He was
that judge. I read in the paper.

820
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:32,748
Did they ever find out, you know...

821
01:04:32,911 --> 01:04:34,834
how, who did it?

822
01:04:34,996 --> 01:04:37,670
You don't mind me asking you?
I mean, it's...

823
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:42,087
You're changing the subject.

824
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:47,308
He's why you punish
yourself, isn't it?

825
01:04:47,467 --> 01:04:48,719
Jerry, please, don't start.

826
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:51,889
You get on the treadmill, and
turn your back to that picture...

827
01:04:52,055 --> 01:04:53,773
like you're running away from him.

828
01:04:53,932 --> 01:04:56,651
You punish yourself. Sometimes
you sing along to the music...

829
01:04:56,810 --> 01:04:59,188
but most of the time,
you punish yourself. Wow.

830
01:04:59,354 --> 01:05:02,779
I don't know where you get the
energy after a full day's work.

831
01:05:02,941 --> 01:05:06,411
- You run like a maniac. I wondered why.
- What are you talking about? Music?

832
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:09,368
What are you talking about, huh?
Are you watching me?

833
01:05:09,531 --> 01:05:11,033
What do you do? Sit in your car?

834
01:05:11,199 --> 01:05:13,543
Are you waiting in an
alleyway? Every day?

835
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:16,454
- It's not like...
- What is it? Tell me what it is!

836
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:19,215
- You don't ride your horse...
- Do not change the subject!

837
01:05:19,374 --> 01:05:20,671
Get out of my house. Now!

838
01:05:20,834 --> 01:05:23,713
I will give you $100 to
get out of my house.

839
01:05:23,878 --> 01:05:26,472
I don't need any money.
I got plenty for a rainy day.

840
01:05:26,631 --> 01:05:29,350
Oh, yeah? Well guess what?

841
01:05:30,093 --> 01:05:33,723
- It's pouring out.
- All right, you're tired. I, uh...

842
01:05:33,888 --> 01:05:35,856
Just don't be mad at me, okay?

843
01:05:40,437 --> 01:05:43,737
Use your dead bolts, Alice.
Dead bolts. Okay? Just lock up.

844
01:06:06,129 --> 01:06:08,052
I'm gonna empty my bladder.

845
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:43,212
- How's your bladder?
- I gotta go. How's yours? Hey!

846
01:06:43,374 --> 01:06:45,468
No, no. No, don't do that.

847
01:06:46,211 --> 01:06:47,713
Okay.

848
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:50,849
There's a lot of folks
looking for you.

849
01:06:51,341 --> 01:06:54,641
I guess that makes you
the smart one, huh?

850
01:06:55,637 --> 01:06:57,435
Put your hands on the wheel.

851
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:01,768
Both your hands on
the wheel. Thank you.

852
01:07:01,935 --> 01:07:04,688
- You're welcome.
- Don't mention it.

853
01:07:04,979 --> 01:07:07,698
- Where's my partner?
- Who? Oh!

854
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:10,030
I... He's okay.

855
01:07:10,193 --> 01:07:13,572
But here you are with a gun to your
head asking how your partner is.

856
01:07:14,197 --> 01:07:16,620
You might be okay. Um...

857
01:07:16,783 --> 01:07:19,036
He'll have a headache
for a couple of days.

858
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:21,587
Are your intentions here honorable?

859
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:24,707
I'm not sure what you mean.

860
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:29,175
Uh, they...? Uh, with Alice.
I mean, what...?

861
01:07:29,337 --> 01:07:31,886
Think of me as her guardian angel.

862
01:07:32,674 --> 01:07:36,679
That's ironic because we're
here to protect her from you.

863
01:07:39,347 --> 01:07:43,853
No, you're here because you thought
I'd show up, so that's why you're here.

864
01:07:44,852 --> 01:07:47,856
- Seemed like a possibility.
- Well...

865
01:07:48,022 --> 01:07:50,741
What about your intentions?
Are they, uh...

866
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:52,743
- ...honorable?
- Uh.

867
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:54,028
Yeah.

868
01:07:54,529 --> 01:07:56,156
I'm not a violent man.

869
01:07:56,864 --> 01:07:58,036
No, I'm not by nature.

870
01:07:58,199 --> 01:08:01,294
I'm not a violent man, Mr. Lowry.

871
01:08:01,452 --> 01:08:04,046
But if you hurt Alice in any way...

872
01:08:04,205 --> 01:08:06,879
or anything like that,
I'll kill you.

873
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:11,212
Does that seem honorable enough?

874
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:13,472
Well, um, maybe.

875
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:26,686
Are you pretending?

876
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:29,401
Yes, yes...

877
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:33,526
Sorry.

878
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:34,861
It's got to be here.

879
01:08:51,294 --> 01:08:52,420
Thank God.

880
01:08:57,634 --> 01:08:59,136
- May I help you, sir?
- Yeah.

881
01:08:59,302 --> 01:09:01,225
Okay. Uh...

882
01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:03,731
- I need to scan it.
- All right, put it through.

883
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:04,982
No, this side.

884
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:07,564
Okay, just... I'll do it.
I'll do it. Just...

885
01:09:16,778 --> 01:09:19,247
Bingo! "Catcher in the Rye."

886
01:09:19,405 --> 01:09:23,126
Location is 33 East 17th
Street, Barnes and Noble.

887
01:09:24,661 --> 01:09:26,334
Where's...?

888
01:09:26,496 --> 01:09:29,090
- I'm just putting it in a bag, sir.
- I don't want a bag.

889
01:09:44,889 --> 01:09:46,937
- I got the exact change for you.
- Okay.

890
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:49,068
Make life easy for you.

891
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:59,616
- Your receipt.
- Yeah. Thank you.

892
01:09:59,779 --> 01:10:00,951
You're welcome.

893
01:10:01,114 --> 01:10:02,536
"Catcher in the Rye."

894
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:04,918
- Yeah.
- It's a classic.

895
01:10:05,076 --> 01:10:07,374
- Have you read it?
- You know, I've...

896
01:10:07,662 --> 01:10:09,414
- ...never read it.
- Never?

897
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:12,504
No, I haven't. I never read it.

898
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:23,636
We're going silent, guys.

899
01:10:29,016 --> 01:10:30,438
Confirm silent.

900
01:10:31,811 --> 01:10:33,813
<i>Exploit the art
And watch hip-hop fall apart</i>

901
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:37,860
<i>But I'm a do my part to stay true but please
don't try to tell me what I can not see</i>

902
01:10:38,025 --> 01:10:39,993
Could I have a pretzel?

903
01:10:40,945 --> 01:10:43,698
<i>And expect all props
I'm gettin' dropped like hot rocks</i>

904
01:10:43,865 --> 01:10:46,994
<i>So stop what they doin'
'Cause I'm about to ruin</i>

905
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:08,620
I got him.

906
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:18,501
There he is.

907
01:12:22,797 --> 01:12:24,174
Just one.

908
01:12:26,676 --> 01:12:28,223
Hurry up.

909
01:12:43,109 --> 01:12:44,782
Sorry.

910
01:12:50,241 --> 01:12:51,993
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

911
01:13:24,734 --> 01:13:26,862
Bomb! There's a bomb under my seat!

912
01:13:39,874 --> 01:13:43,253
Be calm! Remain calm and move
out in an orderly fashion!

913
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:10,537
There he is!

914
01:14:28,172 --> 01:14:29,469
I'm not sorry.

915
01:14:29,966 --> 01:14:31,434
Leave me alone, will you?

916
01:15:42,747 --> 01:15:44,841
I'm turning into a Jerry.

917
01:16:37,343 --> 01:16:41,143
I've been given a cease and desist on
all matters related to Jerry Fletcher.

918
01:16:41,305 --> 01:16:45,185
We are not to discuss him with the
press, N.Y.P.D., or anyone else.

919
01:16:45,351 --> 01:16:47,900
Building security is gonna
arrest him on sight...

920
01:16:48,062 --> 01:16:51,441
and we're to report any attempt
he makes to contact you.

921
01:16:52,149 --> 01:16:55,198
I don't like it. Something's
not right here.

922
01:16:55,361 --> 01:16:58,535
Dr. Jonas thought you might
be inclined not to cooperate.

923
01:16:58,697 --> 01:16:59,914
Why is that?

924
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:04,837
Well, we don't know
who Dr. Jonas is.

925
01:17:04,995 --> 01:17:07,464
We don't know who we're
cooperating with.

926
01:17:07,623 --> 01:17:09,921
I had a lot of credentials
flashed in my face.

927
01:17:10,084 --> 01:17:12,803
And after yesterday,
I know not to ask questions.

928
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:15,427
We're out. We're shut off.

929
01:17:15,589 --> 01:17:16,932
We're terminated.

930
01:17:19,009 --> 01:17:20,431
Understood?

931
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:26,188
Understood.

932
01:17:42,116 --> 01:17:44,460
They can't see the
trees for the forest.

933
01:17:53,878 --> 01:17:55,255
<i>Hello?</i>

934
01:17:55,421 --> 01:17:58,470
<i>Hi, may I speak with
Mr. Ketcham, please?</i>

935
01:17:58,632 --> 01:18:00,384
<i>This is Mrs. Ketcham.</i>

936
01:18:00,551 --> 01:18:03,600
Hello, Mrs. Ketcham. Your husband
receives our newsletter.

937
01:18:03,888 --> 01:18:06,767
I wanted to see if he would
like to renew his subscription?

938
01:18:06,932 --> 01:18:11,654
<i>My husband is dead. He was killed
last night in a car accident.</i>

939
01:18:13,564 --> 01:18:16,033
- Miss Sutton here?
- Yes.

940
01:18:16,609 --> 01:18:18,111
Sign here, please.

941
01:18:20,321 --> 01:18:22,415
- Hey, here, wait.
- Thank you.

942
01:18:26,368 --> 01:18:28,166
These just came for you.

943
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:31,339
- Want a vase?
- Yes, please.

944
01:18:34,251 --> 01:18:37,881
"Go out the building to the right.
Take the first bus."

945
01:18:46,639 --> 01:18:49,483
Claudia, tell Jill I'm expecting
a call from Milwaukee.

946
01:18:49,642 --> 01:18:51,360
Transfer the calls to my mobile.

947
01:18:51,518 --> 01:18:53,361
- Will do.
- Thank you.

948
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:02,538
Got her.

949
01:19:04,448 --> 01:19:06,416
Subject is on the move.

950
01:19:30,599 --> 01:19:31,942
Okay, she's on the bus. Go!

951
01:19:32,101 --> 01:19:34,320
Subject on bus 1648.

952
01:19:34,478 --> 01:19:36,071
Will follow.

953
01:19:49,118 --> 01:19:50,210
What the hell?

954
01:19:50,369 --> 01:19:51,712
Keep going!

955
01:20:18,314 --> 01:20:20,988
Ha-ha-ha! Like a Roadrunner
cartoon. See that?

956
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:23,152
- No, see what?
- You didn't see it?

957
01:20:23,319 --> 01:20:25,947
- Nobody ever sees what I see.
- Jerry, Jerry, Jerry.

958
01:20:26,113 --> 01:20:28,491
- What?
- Where did you get your five subscribers?

959
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:30,876
I put an ad on the
computer bulletin board.

960
01:20:31,035 --> 01:20:33,379
Logged in at the library
so they couldn't trace it.

961
01:20:33,537 --> 01:20:35,460
They're dead.
Four out of five of them.

962
01:20:35,622 --> 01:20:39,627
I've checked. All in the last 24 hours.
One accident, two heart attacks, a stroke.

963
01:20:39,793 --> 01:20:41,966
This one I can't reach.
Henry Finch.

964
01:20:42,129 --> 01:20:43,551
They're dead. Dead.

965
01:20:43,714 --> 01:20:45,387
I did that.

966
01:20:46,216 --> 01:20:48,969
Heart attacks and strokes,
that's CIA. Henry Finch!

967
01:20:49,136 --> 01:20:50,479
Oh, my God!

968
01:20:52,222 --> 01:20:53,690
I should've realized.

969
01:20:53,849 --> 01:20:55,977
They monitor absolutely everything.

970
01:20:56,143 --> 01:20:57,861
Elaborate on "they." They?

971
01:20:58,020 --> 01:20:59,272
They?

972
01:20:59,438 --> 01:21:01,941
There's lots of groups, actually.
Lots of initials.

973
01:21:02,107 --> 01:21:05,657
CIA. FBI. IMF, you name it.

974
01:21:05,819 --> 01:21:08,618
They. But they're part of the
same two opposing factions.

975
01:21:08,781 --> 01:21:10,909
- Which are?
- Which are, one...

976
01:21:11,116 --> 01:21:15,337
One. Some of them are really,
really wealthy families.

977
01:21:15,496 --> 01:21:18,420
Their thing is to maintain stability.
That's what they call it.

978
01:21:18,582 --> 01:21:21,756
The other is Eisenhower's
industrial-military complex.

979
01:21:21,919 --> 01:21:24,217
And they want
instability, so they say.

980
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:27,429
So you're saying that group one
is warring with group two?

981
01:21:27,591 --> 01:21:30,561
Yes, at some levels. But at
others, it's the same group.

982
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:33,188
It's scary! It's hand and glove.
Cold wars, hot wars.

983
01:21:33,347 --> 01:21:37,022
- They sit back and watch the whole damn show.
- Jerry. Take a breath.

984
01:21:39,061 --> 01:21:43,612
The latest casualty in the whole fiasco
is one of the richest men in America:

985
01:21:43,774 --> 01:21:46,072
Ernest Harriman.

986
01:21:47,111 --> 01:21:48,283
He was murdered.

987
01:21:48,445 --> 01:21:49,992
- Murdered?
- Here in Manhattan.

988
01:21:50,155 --> 01:21:52,533
No, Jerry, I read in the
paper, he was, um...

989
01:21:52,699 --> 01:21:56,169
He drowned in a swimming pool. It
was an accident, it was in Newport.

990
01:21:56,328 --> 01:22:00,174
No. Nobody dies in Newport. They couldn't
even kill Sunny Von Bulow in Newport.

991
01:22:00,332 --> 01:22:02,175
He drowned, but not in Newport.

992
01:22:02,334 --> 01:22:03,836
Where, then?

993
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:09,224
Right here, the 7th
Street subway station.

994
01:22:09,383 --> 01:22:12,978
A billionaire waiting on the subway?
Why didn't they drown him in his limo?

995
01:22:13,137 --> 01:22:16,562
No, don't you read the papers?
I mean, don't you watch television? Huh?

996
01:22:16,723 --> 01:22:18,691
Last week, this place
was under water.

997
01:22:18,851 --> 01:22:20,819
- A water main broke.
- I know.

998
01:22:20,978 --> 01:22:24,278
But you know what's right above
this area? The Harriman Building.

999
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:28,286
The whole substructure was flooded.
I'm telling you, he didn't drown in a pool.

1000
01:22:28,444 --> 01:22:31,323
Call the, uh, coroner in Rhode
Island or wherever it was...

1001
01:22:31,488 --> 01:22:33,866
and ask if he had chlorinated
water in his lungs.

1002
01:22:34,032 --> 01:22:36,000
- Okay, I will.
- You will?

1003
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:37,707
Yeah, if you want, I will.

1004
01:22:37,870 --> 01:22:39,838
I don't know what to say.
I love you.

1005
01:22:41,206 --> 01:22:42,753
- What?
- I...

1006
01:22:43,333 --> 01:22:44,585
I...

1007
01:22:44,918 --> 01:22:47,262
It's like I resolved to...

1008
01:22:47,421 --> 01:22:50,174
call you up a thousand times a day.

1009
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:52,217
And, um, ask you if
you'll marry me...

1010
01:22:52,843 --> 01:22:54,720
in some old-fashioned way.

1011
01:22:56,430 --> 01:22:58,398
Everything you do is magic.

1012
01:23:01,268 --> 01:23:03,111
Those are song lyrics, Jerry.

1013
01:23:04,688 --> 01:23:06,861
Yeah, I know. I know that.

1014
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:09,951
Uh, I know that. Look.

1015
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:13,910
I'm nervous. I reached out and grabbed
hold of the first thing I could think.

1016
01:23:14,072 --> 01:23:15,870
I know they're song lyrics.

1017
01:23:16,033 --> 01:23:18,707
- But I know how I feel.
- Jerry.

1018
01:23:18,911 --> 01:23:21,790
I think you're confused.
It's been a long day.

1019
01:23:21,955 --> 01:23:25,835
I'm not confused. I'm not. You wanted
to know, that picture on the wall.

1020
01:23:26,001 --> 01:23:28,299
- How that was possible.
- I don't think we should...

1021
01:23:28,462 --> 01:23:30,214
Yes, we should. It's Geronimo.

1022
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:33,179
That's love. And love
gives you insight.

1023
01:23:33,342 --> 01:23:36,391
Love lets you see things that
you wouldn't normally...

1024
01:23:36,553 --> 01:23:38,521
I just know that I've loved you...

1025
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:42,480
- ...since the first time I saw you.
- Jerry. No, no.

1026
01:23:42,643 --> 01:23:44,190
You don't love me.

1027
01:23:44,353 --> 01:23:46,321
- Sure I do.
- No.

1028
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:48,403
- I don't?
- No.

1029
01:23:51,777 --> 01:23:53,404
Uh...

1030
01:23:54,029 --> 01:23:56,202
I thought that, uh...
Well, I thought...

1031
01:23:56,365 --> 01:23:58,993
I just thought that maybe...

1032
01:24:02,621 --> 01:24:04,623
Jerry.

1033
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:05,916
Jerry!

1034
01:24:12,631 --> 01:24:15,134
Jerry! Jerry.

1035
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:19,514
I'm sorry. Jerry, I'm sorry.

1036
01:24:36,989 --> 01:24:39,117
- Hello?
<i>- Alice, we have a call...</i>

1037
01:24:39,283 --> 01:24:41,627
<i>- ...from the Milwaukee post office.</i>
- Yeah?

1038
01:24:41,785 --> 01:24:45,631
<i>The mail for Henry Finch is being
forwarded here to Manhattan.</i>

1039
01:24:45,789 --> 01:24:46,961
Where?

1040
01:24:47,124 --> 01:24:50,253
<i>Foley Square. The
Criminal Courts Building.</i>

1041
01:25:18,905 --> 01:25:20,782
I'd like to see Mr. Finch, please.

1042
01:25:20,949 --> 01:25:23,623
- Who?
- Henry Finch.

1043
01:25:24,161 --> 01:25:26,084
Is he expecting you?

1044
01:25:26,246 --> 01:25:28,340
My name is Sutton with
the Justice Department.

1045
01:25:28,498 --> 01:25:30,250
I'd like to see
Mr. Finch immediately.

1046
01:25:51,772 --> 01:25:54,446
- He'll be right with you.
- Thank you.

1047
01:26:06,286 --> 01:26:08,254
What the hell is going on here?

1048
01:26:08,538 --> 01:26:10,916
I'm very impressed, Alice.

1049
01:26:12,376 --> 01:26:14,549
How's Jerry this morning?

1050
01:26:14,836 --> 01:26:17,760
The more important
question is, who are you?

1051
01:26:17,923 --> 01:26:21,803
Those are much bigger
questions than you think.

1052
01:26:23,470 --> 01:26:25,643
Please sit down.

1053
01:26:33,689 --> 01:26:35,157
For...

1054
01:26:35,315 --> 01:26:38,159
reasons that will soon be...

1055
01:26:38,318 --> 01:26:41,663
regrettably clear, I'm going
to tell you a secret.

1056
01:26:43,073 --> 01:26:46,293
Then you can judge
what and who I am.

1057
01:26:46,660 --> 01:26:47,752
Years ago...

1058
01:26:47,911 --> 01:26:51,290
I worked for the Central
Intelligence Agency...

1059
01:26:51,581 --> 01:26:55,176
on the MK ULTRA program.
Are you familiar with it?

1060
01:26:56,211 --> 01:26:58,009
It was mind control.

1061
01:26:58,171 --> 01:27:00,219
"Manchurian Candidate"
kind of stuff.

1062
01:27:01,508 --> 01:27:03,852
That's a vulgar generalization.

1063
01:27:04,886 --> 01:27:07,309
But yes, uh, you take
an ordinary man...

1064
01:27:07,472 --> 01:27:09,600
and turn him into an assassin.

1065
01:27:09,766 --> 01:27:11,609
That was our goal.

1066
01:27:11,768 --> 01:27:16,945
Now, MK ULTRA was
terminated in 1973.

1067
01:27:17,107 --> 01:27:18,984
But...

1068
01:27:19,151 --> 01:27:20,903
not the...

1069
01:27:21,069 --> 01:27:22,867
research.

1070
01:27:23,029 --> 01:27:25,327
That, I continued.

1071
01:27:27,159 --> 01:27:29,036
Shall I go on?

1072
01:27:31,037 --> 01:27:33,916
"The truth will set you free."

1073
01:27:37,544 --> 01:27:40,889
it involved hallucinogenic
research...

1074
01:27:41,882 --> 01:27:45,762
electroshock to induce
vegetative states...

1075
01:27:45,927 --> 01:27:48,931
terminal experiments in
sensory deprivation.

1076
01:27:49,097 --> 01:27:51,020
Terminal?

1077
01:27:51,183 --> 01:27:53,106
As in, "resulting in death."

1078
01:27:58,356 --> 01:28:00,484
Alice, I'm, uh...

1079
01:28:00,650 --> 01:28:02,869
I'm now trying to pay my penance.

1080
01:28:04,488 --> 01:28:07,913
These things that you're talking
about, you did them to Jerry?

1081
01:28:09,785 --> 01:28:14,416
MK ULTRA was science,
sanctioned by the government.

1082
01:28:16,625 --> 01:28:17,797
It all ended...

1083
01:28:17,959 --> 01:28:20,428
the moment John Hinckley
shot Ronald Reagan.

1084
01:28:26,009 --> 01:28:28,103
No, that wasn't us.

1085
01:28:29,471 --> 01:28:31,565
But the technology had been stolen.

1086
01:28:32,808 --> 01:28:35,778
Pandora's box opened.

1087
01:28:36,686 --> 01:28:40,862
My subjects were taken from me,
used in the private sector.

1088
01:28:41,024 --> 01:28:42,617
Jerry was one of them.

1089
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:45,862
One of your subjects.

1090
01:28:46,696 --> 01:28:49,745
It is imperative that I discover
who stole the technology.

1091
01:28:51,368 --> 01:28:54,793
Alice, I will do
what is necessary...

1092
01:28:55,497 --> 01:28:58,842
to stimulate Jerry into
telling me what he knows.

1093
01:29:00,836 --> 01:29:03,009
Jerry is very dangerous.

1094
01:29:08,009 --> 01:29:10,603
Jerry has killed.

1095
01:29:20,313 --> 01:29:22,111
To find who programmed Jerry...

1096
01:29:22,274 --> 01:29:26,199
I have to find Jerry, but I
can't do that without you.

1097
01:29:44,212 --> 01:29:45,805
Do you recognize this?

1098
01:29:52,888 --> 01:29:54,481
Where did you get that?

1099
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:56,687
You do recognize it, then?

1100
01:29:57,767 --> 01:29:59,610
Of course I do.

1101
01:30:00,228 --> 01:30:03,323
It belonged to my father.
Where did you get it?

1102
01:30:04,232 --> 01:30:08,078
Alice, what do you know
about your father's death?

1103
01:30:10,906 --> 01:30:14,752
He denied a man in prison
appeal for a new trial.

1104
01:30:14,910 --> 01:30:16,662
Ezekiel Walters.

1105
01:30:16,828 --> 01:30:20,549
Walters had nothing to do
with your father's murder.

1106
01:30:22,292 --> 01:30:24,465
When they found him,
he was holding his wallet.

1107
01:30:24,628 --> 01:30:26,881
The only thing missing
was this photo.

1108
01:30:27,047 --> 01:30:29,391
Where did you find it?

1109
01:30:32,093 --> 01:30:35,063
Jerry's safe deposit box.

1110
01:30:37,807 --> 01:30:41,607
Alice, when do you think Jerry
first took notice of you?

1111
01:30:41,770 --> 01:30:44,614
What is it the two of
you have in common?

1112
01:30:46,608 --> 01:30:48,827
I was mugged and he saved me.

1113
01:30:48,985 --> 01:30:52,910
He may have saved you, Alice,
but that was no coincidence.

1114
01:30:53,073 --> 01:30:56,543
Come on, you're a lawyer.
Think like one.

1115
01:30:57,452 --> 01:31:00,331
Your father was assassinated.

1116
01:31:03,333 --> 01:31:08,385
And the sick son of a bitch has
been obsessed with you ever since.

1117
01:31:20,350 --> 01:31:22,773
I am so sorry, Alice.

1118
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:25,318
I truly am.

1119
01:31:57,262 --> 01:31:59,139
- Miss Sutton?
- Uh...

1120
01:31:59,305 --> 01:32:01,057
Hold on one second.

1121
01:32:03,435 --> 01:32:05,437
- Alice, you order pizza?
- No.

1122
01:32:06,354 --> 01:32:07,981
- Oh.
- Hold it.

1123
01:32:22,620 --> 01:32:24,213
"Go to the northeast corner..."

1124
01:32:24,372 --> 01:32:26,500
of Greenwich and Battery Place.

1125
01:32:26,666 --> 01:32:29,761
"Bring the pizza. I have something
important to tell you."

1126
01:32:34,549 --> 01:32:37,598
Call Bill in Security and tell
him Fletcher's in the area.

1127
01:32:37,761 --> 01:32:39,263
I will, sir.

1128
01:32:39,429 --> 01:32:42,433
"I have something
important to tell you."

1129
01:32:43,433 --> 01:32:45,231
Alice.

1130
01:32:45,393 --> 01:32:48,943
I have tried everything
I know to get Jerry to talk.

1131
01:32:49,105 --> 01:32:50,402
Would you try?

1132
01:32:50,565 --> 01:32:52,818
I promise you,
you'll be perfectly safe.

1133
01:32:52,984 --> 01:32:55,282
No way. No way. Alice...

1134
01:32:55,445 --> 01:32:57,539
you don't have to do this.

1135
01:33:02,952 --> 01:33:05,421
- I will.
- Good girl.

1136
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:07,503
I want a bug in this
box, audio and track.

1137
01:33:07,665 --> 01:33:09,713
Right away.

1138
01:33:16,257 --> 01:33:18,726
Hey, that still hot?

1139
01:33:18,885 --> 01:33:22,059
Hop in. Doesn't pay to
stand around too long.

1140
01:33:49,332 --> 01:33:51,505
This is 42-K. We're on him.

1141
01:33:56,714 --> 01:33:58,136
Thanks.

1142
01:33:58,299 --> 01:33:59,846
I'm starving.

1143
01:34:01,136 --> 01:34:02,388
Unh.

1144
01:34:02,887 --> 01:34:04,264
This is good.

1145
01:34:04,430 --> 01:34:06,023
Have some.

1146
01:34:10,103 --> 01:34:12,902
- Do you have him on that?
- We still got him.

1147
01:34:13,064 --> 01:34:15,487
<i>Are you okay, Alice?</i>

1148
01:34:15,650 --> 01:34:19,496
No, you're not. I shouldn't have
said all that stuff I said before.

1149
01:34:21,030 --> 01:34:24,785
I won't do that anymore. Creeped
you out. I can't help the way I feel.

1150
01:34:24,951 --> 01:34:27,204
Jerry, what did you want
to talk to me about?

1151
01:34:27,370 --> 01:34:28,872
Ah.

1152
01:34:29,414 --> 01:34:33,669
I can feel what I... I mean,
I can think? No, I can feel...

1153
01:34:33,835 --> 01:34:37,055
what I want to say, but I can't
think it. No. I can't get it out.

1154
01:34:37,213 --> 01:34:38,681
<i>I got blank spots...</i>

1155
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:40,683
I've heard enough. Stop the car.

1156
01:34:40,842 --> 01:34:43,015
- I want her out of there.
- No! Keep driving.

1157
01:34:43,178 --> 01:34:46,432
It's kind of like, um, you know,
if you sing along with the music.

1158
01:34:46,598 --> 01:34:49,397
If there's no music, then you
know the words with the music.

1159
01:34:49,559 --> 01:34:52,278
- But if there's none, you're helpless.
- I don't understand.

1160
01:34:52,437 --> 01:34:54,565
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

1161
01:34:54,731 --> 01:34:57,325
<i>No. Don't worry about it.</i>

1162
01:34:57,901 --> 01:35:00,245
I want to take you where
the music's playing.

1163
01:35:00,403 --> 01:35:02,155
The music is playing in Queens?

1164
01:35:02,322 --> 01:35:04,666
What? Oh. Uh, no, not today.

1165
01:35:05,867 --> 01:35:07,619
- Did she say Queens?
- Yes.

1166
01:35:07,785 --> 01:35:10,004
<i>This is air unit one.
We've lost visual.</i>

1167
01:35:10,163 --> 01:35:13,588
<i>He's on the lower level. We'll
pick him up on the other side.</i>

1168
01:35:25,345 --> 01:35:27,268
- Where is he?
- Straight ahead.

1169
01:35:28,556 --> 01:35:30,103
About 300 yards.

1170
01:35:33,686 --> 01:35:35,529
- What?
- Nothing.

1171
01:35:35,688 --> 01:35:37,281
You see something?

1172
01:35:39,525 --> 01:35:40,947
- Hang on.
- Aah!

1173
01:35:41,110 --> 01:35:44,330
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

1174
01:35:44,489 --> 01:35:45,490
Let's go.

1175
01:35:45,657 --> 01:35:47,625
- The pizza!
- Whoa, sorry. Sorry!

1176
01:35:47,784 --> 01:35:49,502
- The pizza.
- We don't need it.

1177
01:35:49,661 --> 01:35:52,289
I'll get you another pizza.
It wasn't that good.

1178
01:35:52,455 --> 01:35:54,173
- What's this?
- He stopped.

1179
01:35:56,417 --> 01:35:58,636
I have to go back
and get the pizza.

1180
01:35:58,795 --> 01:36:01,423
- Aah!
- It'll all make sense in a minute.

1181
01:36:01,589 --> 01:36:03,717
Stop, stop, stop!

1182
01:36:03,883 --> 01:36:05,476
Okay, this is us. Hop in.

1183
01:36:06,010 --> 01:36:08,479
All mobile units watch him.
What do you see?

1184
01:36:08,638 --> 01:36:10,436
Slide across. I'll crank her up.

1185
01:36:32,203 --> 01:36:34,001
Yeah. Yeah, coming.

1186
01:36:35,623 --> 01:36:37,751
Air unit one, what do you see?

1187
01:36:37,917 --> 01:36:39,965
<i>We see no traffic.
Repeat, no traffic.</i>

1188
01:36:40,128 --> 01:36:42,301
<i>We'll go down and take a look.</i>

1189
01:37:00,273 --> 01:37:02,446
<i>They've exited the vehicle.</i>

1190
01:37:02,608 --> 01:37:04,610
<i>- The pizza box is still in the car.</i>
- Go.

1191
01:37:13,661 --> 01:37:15,629
Where are we going?

1192
01:37:16,331 --> 01:37:17,457
Connecticut.

1193
01:37:18,041 --> 01:37:22,888
<i>We shut the bridge down. All
off-ramps. Both levels. Got it?</i>

1194
01:37:23,046 --> 01:37:25,299
<i>Roger that. I'll take the west end.</i>

1195
01:37:35,099 --> 01:37:37,227
Where are we going?

1196
01:37:37,643 --> 01:37:40,647
- Shh. Can you hear it?
- What?

1197
01:37:41,606 --> 01:37:44,155
The music, I can almost hear it.

1198
01:37:45,610 --> 01:37:47,203
I almost hear it.

1199
01:37:47,362 --> 01:37:48,989
We will.

1200
01:37:50,031 --> 01:37:51,499
We will.

1201
01:38:15,890 --> 01:38:17,938
Mr. Wilson's office.

1202
01:38:18,101 --> 01:38:20,980
Hello? Hello?

1203
01:38:25,108 --> 01:38:26,109
David Berkowitz.

1204
01:38:27,110 --> 01:38:29,704
Ted Bundy. Richard Speck.

1205
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:33,866
What about them?

1206
01:38:34,909 --> 01:38:36,456
Serial killers.

1207
01:38:37,662 --> 01:38:40,461
Serial killers only have two names.
You ever notice that?

1208
01:38:41,165 --> 01:38:44,044
But lone gunman assassins...

1209
01:38:44,210 --> 01:38:47,009
they always have three names.
John Wilkes Booth.

1210
01:38:47,171 --> 01:38:49,299
Lee Harvey Oswald.
Mark David Chapman.

1211
01:38:49,757 --> 01:38:53,136
John Hinckley, he shot Reagan.
He only has two names.

1212
01:38:55,930 --> 01:38:59,355
Yeah, but he only just shot
Reagan. Reagan didn't die.

1213
01:38:59,517 --> 01:39:01,690
If Reagan had died,
I'm pretty sure...

1214
01:39:01,853 --> 01:39:06,654
we probably would all know what
John Hinckley's middle name was.

1215
01:39:16,784 --> 01:39:20,254
Mr. Wilson's office. Hello?

1216
01:39:22,707 --> 01:39:25,586
It's her. The line's open.
Get a trace on it.

1217
01:39:25,751 --> 01:39:28,254
- Hot one, line three trace.
- We got a cell trace.

1218
01:39:44,395 --> 01:39:45,612
This is my father's place.

1219
01:39:48,816 --> 01:39:51,114
This is where the music's playing.

1220
01:40:09,337 --> 01:40:11,260
I just thought of another one.

1221
01:40:11,422 --> 01:40:14,471
James Earl Ray. The guy
that got Luther King.

1222
01:40:15,301 --> 01:40:18,430
Then there's Sirhan Sirhan.
I haven't figured that out.

1223
01:40:18,596 --> 01:40:21,645
Maybe it's Sirhan Sirhan Sirhan.

1224
01:40:21,807 --> 01:40:24,481
Here we got the stables and
the main house is over there.

1225
01:40:24,644 --> 01:40:26,897
I guess I should
just follow my nose.

1226
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:34,779
What's your middle name, Jerry?

1227
01:40:34,946 --> 01:40:36,823
What? What do you mean?

1228
01:40:36,989 --> 01:40:39,959
- Did you kill my father?
- No.

1229
01:40:43,829 --> 01:40:44,876
Maybe.

1230
01:40:45,790 --> 01:40:47,758
- Maybe?
- I don't know.

1231
01:40:47,917 --> 01:40:50,136
- You don't know?
- No...

1232
01:40:50,294 --> 01:40:51,295
Ugh.

1233
01:40:51,462 --> 01:40:55,183
You were at the horse
show that day. And, uh...

1234
01:40:56,300 --> 01:41:00,021
You never rode again after that.
I think maybe you blame yourself.

1235
01:41:00,346 --> 01:41:03,350
Oh, God, it's on the tip
of my brain. I just...

1236
01:41:08,020 --> 01:41:09,772
He died right here.

1237
01:41:12,024 --> 01:41:14,402
He died right here.

1238
01:41:14,569 --> 01:41:17,698
Did he see you coming, Jerry?
Huh? Did he beg for his life?

1239
01:41:17,863 --> 01:41:21,333
You put a gun to his head and you
shot him, didn't you? Didn't you?

1240
01:41:21,492 --> 01:41:25,417
He died in the dirt, like an animal!
Jerry, you killed my father!

1241
01:41:25,580 --> 01:41:29,881
Answer me! I have to know!
Tell me, please. Please, tell me.

1242
01:41:30,042 --> 01:41:33,296
Please tell me!
Please tell me. Please.

1243
01:41:37,258 --> 01:41:38,976
I...

1244
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:42,889
went to the court to
kill your father.

1245
01:41:43,848 --> 01:41:45,100
I'm sorry.

1246
01:41:45,266 --> 01:41:48,486
That what I was programmed to
do that. The Ezekiel Walters hearing.

1247
01:41:48,644 --> 01:41:50,988
I had a gun, and...

1248
01:41:51,147 --> 01:41:55,402
I couldn't shoot him. I couldn't
do it because I saw you.

1249
01:41:56,235 --> 01:41:58,033
That was the first
time I ever saw you.

1250
01:41:58,195 --> 01:42:00,744
That's the first time we met.

1251
01:42:01,949 --> 01:42:04,668
And, oh, boy, I knew that
if I was to screw up...

1252
01:42:04,827 --> 01:42:08,206
that Jonas, he was gonna send somebody
else to do the job I didn't do.

1253
01:42:08,372 --> 01:42:11,000
So I decided to watch
him and make him safe.

1254
01:42:11,167 --> 01:42:12,419
- Make it safe.
- Safe?

1255
01:42:12,585 --> 01:42:15,008
- He started carrying a gun.
- Oh, I know.

1256
01:42:15,171 --> 01:42:18,596
I know. He stuck it in my face the first
time I tried to introduce myself.

1257
01:42:18,758 --> 01:42:21,386
And I had to... Had to...

1258
01:42:21,552 --> 01:42:23,145
Uh...

1259
01:42:25,806 --> 01:42:27,854
I didn't kill him.

1260
01:42:33,356 --> 01:42:37,532
I didn't kill him. We
became friends. Yes.

1261
01:42:38,277 --> 01:42:39,403
Oh.

1262
01:42:39,570 --> 01:42:41,072
He made really good coffee.

1263
01:42:41,238 --> 01:42:45,459
And he tried to help me
remember all of this stuff.

1264
01:42:49,830 --> 01:42:53,801
One of Jonas' guys...
No. One of... Unh.

1265
01:43:03,177 --> 01:43:06,431
When I got here,
he was already dying.

1266
01:43:07,056 --> 01:43:10,526
When I... He was dying
when I got here.

1267
01:43:10,685 --> 01:43:14,064
What does Jonas have to
do with Ezekiel Walters?

1268
01:43:19,610 --> 01:43:22,705
Ezekiel Carl Walters.

1269
01:43:24,198 --> 01:43:28,499
Ezekiel Carl Walters. Ezekiel
Walters is one of Jonas' fall guys!

1270
01:43:28,661 --> 01:43:33,292
He's the three name thing!
Ezekiel Carl Walters! You see? He...

1271
01:43:34,208 --> 01:43:37,838
Oh, he was innocent,
innocent of everything.

1272
01:43:39,964 --> 01:43:44,435
Your father was gonna reopen the case.
He was gonna reopen the case because...

1273
01:43:44,593 --> 01:43:46,436
he didn't accept the
official story.

1274
01:43:46,595 --> 01:43:48,393
- Why?
- Because...

1275
01:43:50,641 --> 01:43:52,484
Because he believed me.

1276
01:43:52,643 --> 01:43:54,566
He believed me.

1277
01:43:57,815 --> 01:43:59,283
And...

1278
01:43:59,442 --> 01:44:03,618
He believed that I couldn't do
what I was meant to do to him...

1279
01:44:03,779 --> 01:44:06,248
and he was gonna blow
it all wide-open...

1280
01:44:06,407 --> 01:44:09,035
before Jonas sent someone
else. He was gonna...

1281
01:44:13,289 --> 01:44:14,836
Oh.

1282
01:44:15,666 --> 01:44:17,043
When he was dying...

1283
01:44:18,002 --> 01:44:20,221
he was still really
worried about you.

1284
01:44:22,339 --> 01:44:24,888
He took your picture
out of his wallet.

1285
01:44:25,342 --> 01:44:26,889
He called you his baby.

1286
01:44:28,679 --> 01:44:32,149
I told him I'd keep you safe.

1287
01:44:32,933 --> 01:44:36,278
And I kept your picture, and I've
been watching you ever since.

1288
01:44:37,188 --> 01:44:40,283
I didn't... I didn't kill him.

1289
01:44:41,275 --> 01:44:43,619
But I was late and...

1290
01:44:45,196 --> 01:44:46,869
I'm sorry.

1291
01:44:48,616 --> 01:44:50,084
I'm sorry.

1292
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:01,553
I believe you.

1293
01:45:02,129 --> 01:45:03,881
I believe you.

1294
01:45:16,936 --> 01:45:18,279
He made great coffee.

1295
01:45:18,771 --> 01:45:19,772
Heh, yeah.

1296
01:45:21,232 --> 01:45:23,485
- What the?
- They traced my phone. Sorry. Oh, God!

1297
01:45:23,651 --> 01:45:26,279
- No! Before I go, I have to ask you one thing.
- What?

1298
01:45:26,445 --> 01:45:28,868
- Did you switch the charts?
- Now is not the time.

1299
01:45:29,031 --> 01:45:31,750
Now is all I got! Did you
switch them? Did you?

1300
01:45:33,327 --> 01:45:35,500
- Yes.
- I knew it. I knew it!

1301
01:45:42,044 --> 01:45:43,421
Freeze!

1302
01:45:46,465 --> 01:45:49,059
- Freeze!
- Get away from her!

1303
01:45:54,849 --> 01:45:56,817
- Get off me!
- Leave her alone!

1304
01:45:58,352 --> 01:46:00,150
Get off me!

1305
01:46:01,772 --> 01:46:04,241
Let go of me! Jerry!

1306
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:05,777
Get off her!

1307
01:46:05,943 --> 01:46:07,536
Jerry!

1308
01:46:19,790 --> 01:46:21,884
You really embarrassed me, Jerry.

1309
01:46:22,042 --> 01:46:25,342
You made certain people take
notice of me who shouldn't have.

1310
01:46:29,675 --> 01:46:31,427
Alice, are you all right?

1311
01:46:33,012 --> 01:46:34,355
Wilson!

1312
01:47:08,255 --> 01:47:09,347
Alice.

1313
01:47:11,842 --> 01:47:13,389
You shouldn't watch, Jerry.

1314
01:47:14,678 --> 01:47:16,931
It's a moment without hope.

1315
01:47:18,515 --> 01:47:20,768
You've never seen her run.

1316
01:47:43,248 --> 01:47:44,966
Agh!

1317
01:48:11,986 --> 01:48:14,865
This will put my
words in your mouth.

1318
01:48:22,913 --> 01:48:27,214
Once this does its job, you'll swear
that you killed her yourself.

1319
01:48:29,169 --> 01:48:30,796
She's dead, you know.

1320
01:48:36,010 --> 01:48:38,934
Well, then you can't
hurt me anymore.

1321
01:48:40,764 --> 01:48:42,937
I'll be the judge of that.

1322
01:48:52,776 --> 01:48:54,744
Come on in. I'll get the lights.

1323
01:49:03,871 --> 01:49:05,544
Holy shit.

1324
01:49:05,706 --> 01:49:07,174
- We need to talk.
- Yeah.

1325
01:49:07,332 --> 01:49:10,085
When I was in here last night,
there were, like, desks.

1326
01:49:10,252 --> 01:49:14,428
That's messed up. I'm going to call
management right now. This is not good.

1327
01:49:14,590 --> 01:49:18,060
You guys, I'll meet you
downstairs. Go ahead.

1328
01:49:20,054 --> 01:49:21,101
Come on.

1329
01:49:24,641 --> 01:49:27,394
Who's the Deputy
Director of the FBI?

1330
01:49:27,561 --> 01:49:29,734
You think we have time
for 20 Questions?

1331
01:49:29,897 --> 01:49:32,696
Hold it right there. Put
your hands in the air.

1332
01:49:39,656 --> 01:49:40,828
What gave me away?

1333
01:49:41,867 --> 01:49:44,620
Nothing. I just
wanted to make sure.

1334
01:49:44,787 --> 01:49:46,835
Who are you guys?

1335
01:49:48,082 --> 01:49:50,801
If the intelligence
world was a family...

1336
01:49:50,959 --> 01:49:53,462
think of us as the uncle
no one ever talks about.

1337
01:49:57,091 --> 01:49:58,809
We watched Jerry.

1338
01:49:58,967 --> 01:50:01,390
Jerry's the bait for Jonas.

1339
01:50:01,929 --> 01:50:05,058
Jonas has shown himself.
Why don't you take him?

1340
01:50:05,599 --> 01:50:07,397
Jonas builds assassins.

1341
01:50:07,559 --> 01:50:11,439
We need to know who they are, where
they are and who Jonas works for.

1342
01:50:13,774 --> 01:50:16,527
Jonas had my father
killed, didn't he?

1343
01:50:19,029 --> 01:50:20,531
We think so.

1344
01:50:22,199 --> 01:50:24,327
- Do you know where Jerry is?
- No.

1345
01:50:24,493 --> 01:50:27,121
I wish I did. Honest.

1346
01:50:29,957 --> 01:50:31,709
What are you gonna do?

1347
01:50:32,626 --> 01:50:34,628
I'm gonna find him...

1348
01:50:34,878 --> 01:50:36,880
because he'd find me.

1349
01:50:37,798 --> 01:50:41,974
- Let's work together on this.
- I don't think that's a good idea.

1350
01:50:43,470 --> 01:50:46,314
Let me give you a number where
you can call if you need me.

1351
01:50:46,473 --> 01:50:49,352
Hey! Hands in the air.

1352
01:51:00,737 --> 01:51:01,954
I'm sorry.

1353
01:51:15,294 --> 01:51:16,637
Everybody's sorry.

1354
01:53:34,308 --> 01:53:35,605
Geronimo.

1355
01:53:36,059 --> 01:53:37,106
Son of a bitch.

1356
01:54:02,502 --> 01:54:05,472
<i>The president left the
area moments earlier...</i>

1357
01:54:05,630 --> 01:54:07,428
<i>and is currently safe in Germany.</i>

1358
01:54:07,591 --> 01:54:11,346
<i>The quake in southern Turkey
measured 7.3 on the Richter scale.</i>

1359
01:54:11,511 --> 01:54:15,061
<i>Thousands are feared missing or
dead. More on this story as it...</i>

1360
01:54:23,357 --> 01:54:24,404
Can I help you?

1361
01:54:24,566 --> 01:54:26,284
Yes. I'm with the
Justice Department.

1362
01:54:26,443 --> 01:54:30,573
I need to see any male patients who have
been brought in in the last 12 hours.

1363
01:54:30,739 --> 01:54:34,460
Justice Department? You got some
credentials, a badge or something?

1364
01:54:46,380 --> 01:54:48,223
This is the Treasury Department.

1365
01:54:50,092 --> 01:54:53,141
But it'll do. Come on, let's go.

1366
01:54:56,139 --> 01:54:59,234
<i>You're just too good to be true</i>

1367
01:54:59,393 --> 01:55:00,690
That's better.

1368
01:55:08,860 --> 01:55:11,830
Yo, Marie! What happened to those
two guys came in this morning?

1369
01:55:11,988 --> 01:55:14,707
They were transferred to
Mount Vernon immediately.

1370
01:55:16,410 --> 01:55:17,536
Sorry.

1371
01:55:28,255 --> 01:55:29,302
Jerry?

1372
01:55:33,343 --> 01:55:35,937
Jerry? Hey, Jerry!

1373
01:55:36,096 --> 01:55:37,848
Jerry, can you hear me?

1374
01:55:38,348 --> 01:55:41,192
Jerry. Jerry?

1375
01:55:43,812 --> 01:55:45,906
Can you hear me, Jerry?

1376
01:55:47,816 --> 01:55:50,990
<i>You're just too good to be true</i>

1377
01:55:53,947 --> 01:55:56,917
<i>You're just too good to be true</i>

1378
01:55:58,118 --> 01:56:01,998
Jerry, tell me where
you are. Jerry!

1379
01:56:03,248 --> 01:56:04,921
Jerry?

1380
01:56:05,876 --> 01:56:09,426
<i>I love you, baby</i>

1381
01:56:10,130 --> 01:56:12,553
<i>And if it's quite all right</i>

1382
01:56:12,716 --> 01:56:14,593
<i>I need you, baby</i>

1383
01:56:14,759 --> 01:56:17,683
<i>Through all the lonely nights</i>

1384
01:56:17,846 --> 01:56:19,814
Hi, Alice.

1385
01:56:20,474 --> 01:56:21,851
Hi, Jerry.

1386
01:56:22,017 --> 01:56:25,237
- Alice, I'm sorry you're dead.
- Jerry.

1387
01:56:25,395 --> 01:56:28,274
- Unh.
- Jerry, tell me where you are.

1388
01:56:28,857 --> 01:56:30,404
Right here.

1389
01:56:32,152 --> 01:56:33,654
Uh...

1390
01:56:34,571 --> 01:56:36,744
- Um...
- Where's "here," Jerry?

1391
01:56:37,949 --> 01:56:41,294
On the floor. I'm... Uh...

1392
01:56:42,662 --> 01:56:45,506
Behind a waffle or a...

1393
01:56:48,251 --> 01:56:51,221
The paint is peeling
on the ceiling.

1394
01:56:53,006 --> 01:56:55,805
That rhymes.
Peeling on the ceiling.

1395
01:56:58,261 --> 01:57:00,889
Nice views, and I can...

1396
01:57:06,520 --> 01:57:09,069
I can see the smokestacks
in the light.

1397
01:57:09,231 --> 01:57:10,904
Good views.

1398
01:57:11,066 --> 01:57:13,410
Where can you see the
smokestacks in this building?

1399
01:57:13,568 --> 01:57:15,946
Smokestacks? Um, smokestacks.

1400
01:57:16,112 --> 01:57:18,285
That would be the power station.

1401
01:57:18,448 --> 01:57:22,328
You can see it from the north wing, upstairs,
but that's been closed for two years.

1402
01:57:22,494 --> 01:57:25,873
Take me there, right now. Jerry,
I'm coming to get you. Come on.

1403
01:57:26,414 --> 01:57:29,293
Alice? Alice?

1404
01:57:31,711 --> 01:57:33,179
You can fit through there?

1405
01:57:33,880 --> 01:57:35,553
Around this corner.

1406
01:57:35,715 --> 01:57:37,433
Down the hall.

1407
01:57:38,134 --> 01:57:40,478
Just honk the horn. I'll come out.

1408
01:57:42,055 --> 01:57:43,307
Yeah, this is it.

1409
01:57:43,473 --> 01:57:45,976
- You have a key?
- I don't have a key.

1410
01:57:46,560 --> 01:57:49,814
- Can you break it open?
- Lady, hundred bucks doesn't cover this.

1411
01:57:49,980 --> 01:57:53,359
I'll clean the place up. I'll...

1412
01:57:53,525 --> 01:57:54,697
Whoa! No, wait!

1413
01:57:54,859 --> 01:57:57,578
- Let's think about this! Wait, come on.
- Come on.

1414
01:58:17,090 --> 01:58:19,138
This is as far as I go, lady.

1415
01:58:20,093 --> 01:58:23,563
Call the police and this man.
Tell them where I am.

1416
01:58:24,598 --> 01:58:26,396
I'll call for backup. Agh.

1417
01:58:26,558 --> 01:58:27,980
I'll call for backup.

1418
01:58:28,143 --> 01:58:32,944
Call Roto-Rooter, that's the name.

1419
01:59:16,566 --> 01:59:19,410
What'd you think this
would get you, Jerry?

1420
01:59:19,569 --> 01:59:22,618
Ugh, how would I know?
I'm tied up on the floor.

1421
01:59:26,534 --> 01:59:29,413
I don't know, maybe
I wanted some attention.

1422
01:59:30,038 --> 01:59:31,665
I was lonely.

1423
01:59:41,591 --> 01:59:43,093
Wow.

1424
01:59:46,680 --> 01:59:48,398
Ooh, heh.

1425
01:59:48,556 --> 01:59:52,186
Are you all right?
Are you all right, huh?

1426
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:56,281
This is, like, the best
dream I ever had.

1427
01:59:58,024 --> 02:00:00,527
- Alice.
- Yeah?

1428
02:00:01,027 --> 02:00:02,904
Could you untie me?

1429
02:00:03,071 --> 02:00:05,745
Oh, my God, yes,
of course. I'm sorry.

1430
02:00:23,508 --> 02:00:25,761
- North wing?
- Can I see some ID?

1431
02:00:25,927 --> 02:00:27,429
ID him, Flip.

1432
02:00:27,595 --> 02:00:30,394
- Through that door, but it's abandoned.
- No matter.

1433
02:00:33,518 --> 02:00:34,895
Oh, God! I'm sorry.

1434
02:00:35,061 --> 02:00:36,108
Can you walk?

1435
02:00:36,271 --> 02:00:38,023
I think so.

1436
02:00:39,858 --> 02:00:41,860
- Kiss me.
- What?

1437
02:00:42,026 --> 02:00:43,653
For luck.

1438
02:00:43,820 --> 02:00:45,788
Kiss me and...

1439
02:00:46,781 --> 02:00:49,955
- Jerry, you're crazy.
- No, I'm certifiable, I know...

1440
02:00:50,118 --> 02:00:54,043
but kiss me once. Come on.
Kiss me, then we'll go.

1441
02:01:18,480 --> 02:01:20,903
Jerry, you continually surprise me.

1442
02:01:42,670 --> 02:01:43,967
Go. Go!

1443
02:01:47,050 --> 02:01:48,097
Alice.

1444
02:01:49,636 --> 02:01:53,015
I always seem to come between
you and the men in your life.

1445
02:02:00,730 --> 02:02:02,232
No!

1446
02:02:50,363 --> 02:02:51,956
- Somebody help me!
- Unh.

1447
02:02:52,115 --> 02:02:53,788
Help me!

1448
02:02:57,662 --> 02:03:00,336
- Throw down your weapon!
- Don't shoot!

1449
02:03:00,498 --> 02:03:01,715
Don't shoot!

1450
02:03:01,875 --> 02:03:03,969
Get an ambulance here, now.

1451
02:03:10,174 --> 02:03:11,642
Geronimo.

1452
02:03:13,511 --> 02:03:14,979
Is that this place?

1453
02:03:15,680 --> 02:03:17,307
No, not anymore.

1454
02:03:19,934 --> 02:03:22,312
It's love. And...

1455
02:03:22,687 --> 02:03:24,735
love gives you wings.

1456
02:03:26,858 --> 02:03:29,862
And helps you fly and
we can fly away.

1457
02:03:36,034 --> 02:03:37,536
Yes, I do.

1458
02:03:37,702 --> 02:03:39,079
I do so.

1459
02:03:43,875 --> 02:03:45,047
I love you.

1460
02:03:45,209 --> 02:03:46,335
I do.

1461
02:03:53,551 --> 02:03:55,098
I love you too.

1462
02:04:04,896 --> 02:04:06,068
Now you tell me.

1463
02:04:10,944 --> 02:04:12,366
Jerry.

1464
02:04:14,322 --> 02:04:17,201
Jerry. Jerry.

1465
02:04:17,784 --> 02:04:22,085
Jerry. Jerry! Jerry. No! Jerry.

1466
02:04:22,246 --> 02:04:24,590
Somebody help me, please!

1467
02:04:24,749 --> 02:04:29,255
Somebody help me! Jerry.

1468
02:04:33,091 --> 02:04:35,093
I'm right here. I'm here with you.

1469
02:04:35,259 --> 02:04:37,102
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

1470
02:04:37,261 --> 02:04:40,856
No, I want to go with him. I want
to stay with him! No! Please.

1471
02:04:41,015 --> 02:04:42,562
Stop pulling on me.

1472
02:04:44,936 --> 02:04:46,188
Jerry, I'm right here!

1473
02:04:46,354 --> 02:04:48,277
- Clear!
- Jerry!

1474
02:04:48,439 --> 02:04:51,864
Jerry! Jerry, look at me!

1475
02:06:41,010 --> 02:06:43,012
I miss your face.

1476
02:07:09,163 --> 02:07:10,540
Hi.

1477
02:07:15,086 --> 02:07:16,713
I'm back...

1478
02:07:17,088 --> 02:07:18,931
if you'll have me, Johnny. Hmm?

1479
02:07:20,299 --> 02:07:22,301
Is that a "yes"?

1480
02:07:55,710 --> 02:07:57,087
Geronimo.

1481
02:08:14,854 --> 02:08:18,154
As long as they think
you're dead, she's safe.

1482
02:08:20,193 --> 02:08:22,366
I kept my end of the bargain.

1483
02:08:22,528 --> 02:08:24,030
What about yours?

1484
02:08:24,197 --> 02:08:26,040
Yeah, I'll tell you
all I can remember.

1485
02:08:26,199 --> 02:08:30,545
I'll give you all the gravy on
Jonas and his operation and...

1486
02:08:32,038 --> 02:08:34,040
You're gonna have to
help me, though, Lowry.

1487
02:08:34,207 --> 02:08:35,629
It's coming back, but slow.

1488
02:08:35,791 --> 02:08:37,134
You got it.

1489
02:08:37,877 --> 02:08:40,505
By the way, my real name's Hatcher.

1490
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:46,518
Pleased to meet you.

1491
02:08:46,886 --> 02:08:49,639
- Ow. Go easy on me.
- Oh, sorry about that.

1492
02:08:49,805 --> 02:08:52,103
I guess nothing was what
it seemed to be, huh?

1493
02:08:54,936 --> 02:08:56,358
Guess not.

1494
02:08:58,064 --> 02:08:59,611
Except her.

1495
02:09:20,920 --> 02:09:22,672
Son of a bitch.

1496
02:09:30,137 --> 02:09:32,765
- Brought the morning paper for you.
- Thanks, Flip.

1497
02:09:32,932 --> 02:09:35,651
- It is Flip, isn't it?
- Yes, it's Flip.

1498
02:09:36,769 --> 02:09:38,897
Don't even think about it.

1499
02:09:40,106 --> 02:09:41,699
At least not for now.

1500
02:09:56,706 --> 02:09:58,959
<i>And if it's quite all right</i>

1501
02:09:59,125 --> 02:10:00,752
<i>I need you, baby</i>

1502
02:10:01,419 --> 02:10:03,092
<i>To warm the lonely nights</i>

1503
02:10:03,254 --> 02:10:10,263
<i>Baby, trust in me when I say</i>

1504
02:10:10,428 --> 02:10:13,773
<i>Oh, pretty baby</i>

1505
02:10:13,931 --> 02:10:15,604
<i>If it's quite all right</i>

1506
02:10:15,766 --> 02:10:16,892
We're all right.

1507
02:10:17,059 --> 02:10:18,106
<i>Baby</i>

1508
02:10:18,269 --> 02:10:19,316
We got a future.

1509
02:10:19,478 --> 02:10:23,984
<i>Hold you tight
And let me love you, baby</i>

1510
02:10:24,150 --> 02:10:26,619
<i>Let me love you</i>
