where he either makes
excuses within his mind to be unaffected...

or he finds some way
to trample his guilty sensations.

that there is no justice
nor righteousness in their slavery.

1371
01:43:05,497 --> 01:43:07,791
But you do open up an interesting question.

1372
01:43:08,917 --> 01:43:10,357
What right have you to your niggers,

1373
01:43:10,377 --> 01:43:11,879

1374

- What right?
- Mmm.

1375
01:43:14,131 --> 01:43:16,967
I bought them. I paid for them.

1376
01:43:17,259 --> 01:43:19,052
Of course you did, and the law says

1377
01:43:19,178 --> 01:43:21,013
you have the right to hold a nigger.

1378
01:43:21,138 --> 01:43:23,098
But begging the law's pardon, it lies.

1379
01:43:23,807 --> 01:43:25,851
Suppose they pass a law taking away

1380
01:43:25,934 --> 01:43:27,978
your liberty, making you a slave.

1381

Suppose.

1382
01:43:29,354 --> 01:43:31,023
That ain't a supposable case.

1383
01:43:31,190 --> 01:43:32,524
Laws change, Epps.

1384
01:43:32,858 --> 01:43:34,902
Universal truths are constant.

1385
01:43:35,027 --> 01:43:37,905
It is a fact, a plain and simple fact...

1386

is true and right for all.

You comparing me to a nigger, Bass?

I'm only asking, in the eyes of God,
what is the difference?
