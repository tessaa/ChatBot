Have fun.

00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,160
- Where can I find Frank Barnes?

5
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,040

6
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,760

00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,160
Excuse me, I'm looking for Frank Barnes.

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,240

Is there a problem?

15
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,040
No problem. I just don't like
working in a damn daycare center.

16
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,240

17
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,960
No I do not like to work

18
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,120
All right.

19

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,240
I heard they made him a shop steward.
Contact the ETU.

24
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,200
From the first year?

25
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,000
Hell, you know how he got hired.

26
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,280

27

His two uncles are running
things over at Thornwood.

28
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,680
And his older brother is the chief Deacon.

29
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,040
The whole family's from Stanton.

30
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,000
No wonder.

31
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,680
Ya know they shitcan guys everyday. Ya got
the right last name and rookie's paygrade...

32
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,040

33
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,940
What the hell are these guys doing?

34
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:43,980
Dewey. Elise.

35
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,940
Sorry to break up charm school.

36
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,180
What the hell is that beast still
doing on the D16?

37
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,780
I told you I need that track clear.

38
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,660
Relax, Manny, w're just about to move that.

39
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,700
Like hell you are, my ass.

40
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:00,700
We have 150 schools students coming on a
field trip on D16, I need that track clear.

41
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,180
D-10's clear, you can set it there.

42
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,300
Okay, you know your lines.

43
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,260
Welcome to the Railroad safety campaign.

44
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,620
We're a program made to educate people like
yourself

45
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,740
about railway safety.

46
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:19,820
Hey, settle down.

47
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,380
Let's have a show of hands.

48
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,180
Who has ridden a train before?

49
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,220
All right.
All aboard.

50
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,780
So, what's our day?

51
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,340
They got us going on light power

52
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:40,060
Supposed to pick up 25 cars just passed
Stanton and straight shot to Wilkinson.

53
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,300
Any slow orders?

54
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:42,740
No.

55
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,820
Are you sure?

56
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,220
Maybe hot I didn't red?

57
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,260
No. No slow orders.

58
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,620
All right.

59
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,060
Dewey, what the hell's
taking you so long?

60
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:04,300
It's 39 cars, the thing's a half a mile
long, for Christ's sake.

61
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,020
Elise, channel up.

62
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,300
Starts, Dewey.

63
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,580
Do you believe this shit?

64
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,220
Hey, hold up, you forgot to tie in the
air at this point.

65
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,660
Yeah, so?

66
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,900
So, you don't have any air brakes.

67
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:26,340
Tie the hose once we park
for Inspection.

68
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,580
OK.

69
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,140
I only got one rule.

70
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,700
One rule only.

71
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,140
If you're gonna do something, do it right.

72
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,140
If you do not know how to do it,
you ask me. All right?

73
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,540
Likewise, if you need anything from me
speak up

74
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,940
because ... you're the conductor.

75
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,780
Once we get our freight,
it's your train.

76
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,420
I'm just the guy driving it.

77
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,900
How long you been out of training?

78
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:56,940
About four months.

79
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,380
- Four months?
- Yeah. Wow.

80
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,580
Full on, you're our
best rookie.

81
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,980
- How long you been railroading?
- 28 years.

82
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,380
November 13, 1981. 28 years.

83
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,460
What did you do before that?
Oh...

84
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,540
I do not know. Bunch of different jobs.

85
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,180
No railroad.
Nah, just uh...

86
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,940
I did something different.

87
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,500
Something different?

88
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,620
What do you mean, something better?

89
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,860
Something ...

90
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,180
- Just different?
- Different.

91
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:34,380
Dewey, don't want to rush you?
I'd like to eat lunch at some point.

92
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,380
Yes.
Hey.

93
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,580
Your lawyer just called.

94
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,820
You got a break.

95
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,540
The hearing was moved up to this morning.

96
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,660
Looks like we're going home.

97
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,220
That's great, but ...

98
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,420
Did you tell them I was working?
I can't come in.

99
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,780
Yes, yes, yes.
He said no problem.

100
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,060
- It's looking good.
- All right.

101
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:28,740
Call me an hour to see what's happening.
- I will, Give me a call.

102
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,900
You're ready to pull out or what?

103
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,740
Coming.

104
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,940
All right.

105
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,860
We're leaving.

106
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,100
What's our fuel guages?

107
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,700
- Fuel guage?
- 2900.

108
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,740
2900?

109
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,740
Parking brake released.

110
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:53,900
Good, good, good.

111
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,340
Bulletins updated.

112
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,740
Revision done, reserves as well.

113
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,700
We are ready to go.

114
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,100
Good. All right.

115
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,500
29 cars, there are 10 to go, you're good.

116
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,220
29 so far ...

117
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,380
Dewey.

118
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:32,940
Dewey?

119
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,060
Hold your horses.

120
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,740
What's wrong?

121
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,860
The damn switch is not pulled.

122
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,900
Track's not for D16.

123
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,500
What's up?
What's your stopping distance?

124
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,220
At least 20 cars to a stop.
Damn it!

125
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,300
Can we back up, we still
have a little time.

126
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,140
Off.

127
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,820
Do not leave that cab, man.

128
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,900
Don't worry, I'll set the independent.

129
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,340
Dewey!

130
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,100
Come on, come back.

131
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,340
Dewey!

132
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,580
Better get back on.

133
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,300
I'm on it, I'm on it.

134
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,100
Damn!

135
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,020
Shit.

136
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,500
You better get back on on, dickhead.

137
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,460
Shit!

138
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,940
I'm an idiot.

139
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,300
An idiot.

140
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,740
God damn it!

141
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,620
Now, what the hell do we do?

142
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,380
Nicole's birthday.

143
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,340
Shoo
t.

144
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,300
Ooh, you're trouble.

145
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:57,060
Don't talk about it.
Put your sister on the phone, please.

146
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,220
Dad.

147
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,820
She doesn't want to talk with you.

148
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,980
What? Listen ... just tell her that I didn't
forgot what day it is ...

149
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,940
Just ... I was running late.

150
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,700
She's gotta date tonight.

151
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,500
With who?

152
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,580
Just put your sister on the phone.

153
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,820
Wait, here she is.

154
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,460
Nikki.

155
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,660
Nikki.

156
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,740
- Hello.
- Listen, Just, I ...

157
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,260
Eh, look, I didn't forget... I

158
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,380
Frank, the coaches are already there.
What's wrong?

159
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,260
No, it's no problem...
except, you got it backwards.

160
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:00,980
Turntable house goes on my end,
you're on the ballast.

161
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,420
On my end.

162
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:05,500
Other than that, no problem.
No problem at all.

163
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,020
Like I told you,

164
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,700
if you do not know something,
just ask, that's all.

165
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,020
Got it.

166
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,660
I hope so.

167
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,700
Whatever.

168
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:29,700
Excuse me?

169
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:34,100
Shit, let's make the new guy
prove himself bullshit.

170
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,420
Gotta tell you, I heard it before.
It gets old really fast.

171
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:40,060
Well, that's how it is at
the retirement home.

172
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,300
The company wants to get rid
of us old heads,

173
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,300
They give all the jobs to you new guys.

174
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,100
You, yellow vests.

175
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,820
I not trying to take anything
from anybody.

176
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,060
As reassuring as that is,

177
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,540
a lot of guys don't see it that way.

178
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,220
I'm here. I'm walking in right now.

179
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:25,380
I got a car full of donuts for those kids.

180
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,500
Coaster, what train?

181
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,620
Connie.

182
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,780
How the hell did this happen?

183
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,460
- It got away.
- It GOT away from you?

184
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,700
It's a train, Dewey, not a chipmonk.

185
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:37,180
I had to get off to throw a switch.

186
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,540
You got off the cab?

187
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,540
Ya. It's gets worse ...
Uh ...

188
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,580
Air brakes weren't tied on.
They aren't tied on, still.

189
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:49,580
We've gotta unmanned train rolling into
opposing traffic, with no airbrakes?

190
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,660
That's what you to tell me?

191
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,660
I set the independent brakes.

192
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,540
That'll for sure stop it.

193
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,620
How fast is it going?

194
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:54,940
No more than 10 miles per.

195
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,340
OK, go jump on the highway
and go after it.

196
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,140
- Now!
- Okay. Ballbuster.

197
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,620
Call the field trip.

198
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:13,580
I do not care where they are on the mainline,
we need to get them to the nearsest siding.

199
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,340
Train Campaign, Train Campaign
this is dispatch, do you copy?

200
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,700
Train Campaign. Answering dispatch,
how can I help you? Over.

201
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:26,140
Campaign, this is Fuller. There is an
unauthorized activity on your track.

202
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:29,100
We you to divert to a siding at Portfield.

203
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,500
Dispatch, please repeat.

204
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:33,660
Please repeat, over.

205
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:37,180
What time is train time?

206
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,100
Anytime.

207
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,780
Divert to a siding at Portfield.
Do you copy?

208
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,780
I copy. I'll divert to a siding
at Portfield? Over.

209
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,300
Get me Triple 7's cargo information.

210
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:54,540
I have to call corporate and report this.

211
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:57,260
Now, Dewey said he aplied the independents

212
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:00,420
So, the friction should stop the damn
thing that after a few miles.

213
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,100
But, we need to alert every northbound
train on the the main line.

214
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:05,580
The first 20 miles of track take priority.

215
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,300
I don't care if you're talking about
spot welding or

216
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:14,340
ground operations in Afghanistan.

217
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,340
- It's all about precision.
- Right.

218
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,300
Thanks.

219
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,220
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

220
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,340
Hello?

221
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,580
Ned, where are you?

222
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,740
Oh, Connie, hey. Um. I'm just
driving in now.

223
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,900
I gotta go.

224
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,300
Well, how far are you from milepost 5?

225
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,740
Roughly, 6 minutes.
Traffic, contingent.

226
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,180
Great, I need you to haul ass over there
to throw a siding switch.

227
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,380
Because we have a coaster.

228
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,820
A coaster? Really?

229
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,700
Yep, it should be at milepost 5
in 15 minutes.

230
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:42,660
Enough time to go to the switch,
get it off the mainline and onto that siding.

231
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,660
- You want me to climb on board and stop it?

232
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,900
What? No, no, no.
We got two arses on their way on the road

233
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,300
you just throw that switch, Ned.

234
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,180
Roger, that.

235
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,980
Can always count on him,
to be late.

236
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,060
I'll see you later.

237
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,500
See ya.

238
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,780
What do we do when we get to
a railroad crossing?

239
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,620
Stop! Look! And, Listen!

240
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,340
I can't hear you!

241
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,180
Stop! Look! And, Listen!

242
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,180
Stanton you know?

243
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,700
Yes. Ever.

244
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,060
My whole family's from Stanton.

245
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,220
You married?

246
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,380
Yes.

247
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,060
Well, sorta. It's a long story.

248
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,620
Got a long day.

249
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,220
How about you, Frank?

250
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,820
It's a short story.

251
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,020
Once.

252
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,940
I have two beautiful daugthers. Though

253
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,420
The 18 and 19 years.

254
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,140
Both waitressing trying to work their way to college.

255
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,660
- Yes?
- Yes.

256
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,100
Where at?

257
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,460
Hooters.

258
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,340
Hooters.

259
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,860
The so is called.

260
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:24,540
That's right, Hooters.
Clear that grin off your face.

261
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,460
- I am a fan.
- Yes.

262
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,780
You're blushing.

263
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,420
I'm used to it.

264
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,300
I'm used to it.

265
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,380
Connie, a call on line 2.

266
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,300
This is Connie Fuller at xxx yard.

267
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,420
On hold.

268
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,420
Did I hear, you gotta coaster?

269
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,300
Yeah, that sorta thing happens,
We're on it.

270
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,300
You want a triple relay?

271
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,500
Listen, I need to speak to
Mr. Darby, directly.

272
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,340
I see. Um, can you
have him call me, then?

273
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:11,540
No, I'm about to release it myself...

274
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,620
Who the hell are you?

275
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,620
I'm here for the railway
safety campaign.

276
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,380
Scott Werner, the regional authority.

277
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:21,740
Federal Safety Inspector. I'm supposed
to give a presentation to the children ...

278
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:22,860
Awesome.
Bunny!

279
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,900
Bunny!
Can you help me out here?

280
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,340
You see this guy right there?

281
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,980
- He's gonna tell you what track. Okay?
- Thank you for your alignment

282
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,420
Thanks, beautiful.
- I'm glad you liked it. Great.

283
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:53,300
Shit. Where the hell is this thing?

284
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,860
Hazardous Material

285
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,380
Bunny!

286
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:05,580
I need to know exactly what's in cars
7 to 10. Get a hold of the shipper, please.

287
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,540
Kiddin me.

288
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,300
- Where's the train?
- What doesit look like the God damned train is?

289
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,460
I do not know where it is

290
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,540
You think I hid
in my back pocket?

291
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,940
- You said ...
- Give me a Connie.

292
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,660
- You're a jackassl.
- Its Ned.

293
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:33,820
- I do not know anything.
- You two have given it in the bar.

294
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,980
Shut the fuck up.
I had to pull the emergency line.

295
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,140
Connie, its Ned.

296
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,380
Did you throw that switch yet?

297
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,780
Yes, 6 minutes ago.
But your train is not here.

298
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,100
I thought it might be going a little
slower than you guessed.

299
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:47,180
But these two numbnuts that you sent, just
showed up and haven't seen it either.

300
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,700
Are you saying our train has
already passed?

301
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,540
Yes ma'am, that would be my guess.

302
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,820
It's not a coaster, that train
is under power.

303
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,380
That would be my guess, too.

304
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,380
Put Dewey on the phone.

305
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,380
Sure.
He wants to talk with you, asshole.

306
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,660
- I need you to rally
every cell in that brain of yours.

307
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:02,820
When you applied the independent

308
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,300
was the trottle in the
forward position?

309
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,140
Yeah, I had to get it moving.

310
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:10,300
In what position was the
trottle set?

311
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,420
Damn it, Dewey, in what position?

312
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:17,420
Connie, the trottle was in notch 8,
full power.

313
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,820
OK, it was 39 cars.

314
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,180
OK. Take the southbound track...

315
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:30,540
Catch up, see if it's still going
slow enough for one of your...

316
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,900
You've got until ...

317
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,380
milepost 13, where the track splits.

318
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,020
Let me talk to Ned, again.

319
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,300
Nice job, asshole.

320
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,780
Ned, I want to go back to your car
and follow the main line, okay?

321
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,220
I want to somebody on that train.

322
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,060
You've got it. Roger, that.

323
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:01,860
Do not you hear.

324
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:05,300
The railway is safe.

325
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,020
Yes!

326
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,220
You're good.

327
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,900
Keep it coming, you've got 10 yards.

328
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,620
20 feet.

329
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,060
Slow 'er down.

330
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,420
All right, you're good.

331
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,860
Yeah, what's going on?

332
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,780
Got a minute?

333
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,500
I thought he said it was looking good.

334
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,020
That's what he thought.

335
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:44,300
Turns out the judge they
assigned was a real hardass.

336
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:45,860
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Look.

337
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,500
The restraining order is being
continued for another 30 days.

338
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,900
30 days?
What am I supposed to do for 30 days?

339
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:54,380
- Stay away from my kid?
And, then, there's a hearing after that, I guess.

340
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,100
What's taking you so long, Will?

341
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,980
Call that lawyer and you tell
him to stick it up his ass ...

342
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,700
Will, pick up the radio.
I gotta go.

343
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:06,260
Will pick up the radio.
Over.

344
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,780
Are you there?

345
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,460
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Get off the phone,

346
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,140
Knock off the handbrakes.
Get up here.

347
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,620
Time to go.
We got work to do.

348
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:15,980
Copy.

349
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:30,540
No, it's definitely under power,
we're not sure of the exact speed, yet.

350
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:33,660
Why don't all these trains have some
kind of dead man brake.

351
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,780
There's a rod the engineer has to hit per-
iodically or airbrakes automatically applied.

352
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:39,780
Unfortunately, this trains airbrakes
were disconnected.

353
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:42,660
Sir, I would gladly explain the particulars
of locomotive operation to you

354
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,860
if we had time, but right now

355
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:48,020
I really need your assistance to post two
officers at all crossings.

356
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,180
One question.

357
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,660
How do you all plan to stop him?

358
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,260
We're working on it.

359
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:58,220
Go, go, go. Switch coming up.

360
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,780
- Are you sure that you can do this?
- Get me along side the cab.

361
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:18,180
- Get along side of it.
- I'm trying.

362
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,340
Go, go, go.

363
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,540
There's little.

364
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,180
You got it. Go, go.

365
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,220
Dewey ...

366
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,940
It's too fast, speed up.

367
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:45,060
Come on, give it up.
Jump, jump.

368
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,380
Come on, man, do it!

369
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,300
Danny, take care!

370
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,220
Now what the hell are we doing?

371
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,740
How many cars we supposed
to cut in?

372
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,500
20. Why?

373
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,220
20 cars. OK.

374
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:28,340
See the switch there, up ahead of us?

375
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:29,980
- The switch over there.
- Yes.

376
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,180
Look in the mirror.

377
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,820
You see the one behind us?

378
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,140
Way back there, you see it?

379
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,100
That's exactly 21 cars
between the two stands.

380
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,740
Do not ask me where I know.

381
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:44,780
So, why is it that there's still more
than 4 and a half more cars yet to clear?

382
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:48,980
Because ...

383
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,180
- Excuse me?
- Because I ...

384
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:54,300
- Because I cut too many cars.
- Too many cars?

385
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:59,060
Maybe if you we're not on my ass, all the
time, I'd be able to think straight.

386
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:02,100
- What do you mean, maybe it's my fault?
- I have done this to exercise.

387
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,140
I'm just saying we should do the job.

388
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,780
If you were ready,
you would not put 5 more.

389
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,020
It was your fault.

390
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,020
I had my training, all right?

391
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,340
Yes, but we're in the real world,
this ain't training.

392
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:17,300
In training they just give you an "F".
Out here, you get killed.

393
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,940
I screwed up, OK?

394
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,140
Stop. Roll back and I'll
cut the extra cars.

395
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,300
What? Roll back?

396
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:26,580
Oh, Lord, we can't stop out
here on the main.

397
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:29,220
We can't go miles on
the Main Line, and then stop.

398
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:32,780
You don't take accounts this size, that
distance in reverse.

399
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,100
Then, let's turn in, the next siding.

400
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,900
Next siding is not for 10 miles.

401
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,020
If you do that, we'll be late.
I don't want to be late.

402
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:44,860
- We have the green light.
- Green light, my ass.

403
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:47,460
What do you mean, my ass.
You're a Colson.

404
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:48,300
What does that mean?

405
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:50,820
- Ask your uncle.
- It's my uncle?

406
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:54,900
- No, it's about five cars in addition.
- A time to stop and cut them loose?

407
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,540
You're the engineer, but it's
God damned my train.

408
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,260
- Yes, it's your train.
- I am wretched chief of the train.

409
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,900
- That's true.
- 1206, check in.

410
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,540
Well, you sure, I'll green
sheet your ass.

411
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:03,500
The so think?

412
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,900
1206, this is the dispatcher.
What's your location? Over.

413
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,100
- Is something funny?
- No.

414
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,340
- Then why are you laughing?
- Because it's funny.

415
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,780
You're a funny guy.

416
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,820
Well trained, but funny.

417
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,140
Yes, there are 1206.

418
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,420
We're 60 miles from Wilkinson.

419
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,420
At 40 minutes out of Fuller yard.

420
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,780
Negative, 1206.

421
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,180
Pull your train to the next siding,
until further instructed. Over.

422
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,420
What's up?

423
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:30,020
There's another man's train out of
Fuller, on the Northbound track. Over.

424
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,060
On our track!?

425
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,180
A coaster?

426
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:38,420
We don't have all the details yet. Just
proceed to the next siding, hold tight. Over.

427
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,940
Next siding is not for ten miles.

428
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,700
Control to 1206.

429
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:45,420
Get to that siding and sit tight,
'til we give you the all clear. Over.

430
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,700
Affirmative.

431
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,660
It's coming right at us.

432
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:04,060
More word on that runaway freight train
in rural Pennsylvania.

433
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:06,260
The train, AWVR 777,

434
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,460
Otherwise known as the "Triple 7"

435
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,700
left Fuller yard
in northern Pennsylvania

436
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,620
sometime before 8 A.M. this morning.

437
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,340
And, no one on board.

438
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,540
Live, local, late breaking...

439
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:19,220
The engineer, they say, made an error
in controlling the train.

440
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:23,060
Before leaving the locomotive, he attempted
to apply the independent brakes.

441
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:25,260
And then, by the time he
realized his mistake,

442
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,980
the train was going too fast
for him to climb back on.

443
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:31,140
We're being told now by a spokesman for
the Public Utilities Commission,

444
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,820
that this employee will
be held accountable.

445
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,900
- Connie.
- Yes.

446
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,380
Headquarters on the phone.
It's Galvin.

447
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,740
Mr Galvin, how are you?

448
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:57,940
- God damn it, how could this happen?
- It was an unfortunate combination of

449
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:00,500
human error and bad luck.

450
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:01,660
Luck?

451
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,900
I was a yardmaster for 10 years,
Ms Hooper

452
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,060
Luck has no
business in a rail yard.

453
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,980
What are you worried about,
in terms of cargo?

454
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,020
Well, obviously the diesel fuel is a concern.

455
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,740
I said, cargo.

456
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:15,980
OK, well, cars 7-10 and 16-19 have a
chemical called molten phenol

457
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:19,820
and we're still trying to connect with the
shipper to determine exactly what that is.

458
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,620
It's used in the manufacture of glue.

459
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,180
Can you hold on one moment?

460
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,620
- You know what is phenol?
- Yes.

461
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:31,620
Uh... Mr Galvin, we have a
FRS inspector with us.

462
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,420
I can put you on speakerphone?

463
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,420
Region 2 Federal Safety Inspector,

464
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:41,100
- Scott Werner. How can I help you?
- Please tell me what you know about molten phenol.

465
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,380
Well, look, it's serious stuff.

466
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,460
Um, very toxic, highly combustible.

467
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,660
Well, that's terrific.

468
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:52,340
Hooper, get state police back on the line,
make sure they have a HAZMAT team briefed and ready?

469
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:55,220
And, asked them to put a spotter chopper over triple 7.

470
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,780
I take it you sided all rail
traffic?

471
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,860
On our end, yes.
Bruster's notifying his own.

472
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,660
Sir, how are we going to handle this?

473
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:05,580
I mean, this train is on route to pass
through some highly populated areas.

474
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,860
We have a strategy call in ... about 2 minutes.

475
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,420
- All right, I'll be ready.
- You will not be on the call, Ms. Hooper.

476
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,100
- Excuse me?
- You will be advised.

477
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,020
We now coordinate with local authorities.

478
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,300
God knows, we have more than 100
crossings that need to be secured.

479
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:23,780
173. Railroad crossings.

480
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:27,020
Between here and AWVR substation
in Bruster.

481
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,500
Listen ... Mr Galvin,

482
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:34,100
this train is half a mile long
and it's traveling at speed

483
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,620
into population,
with 8 freight cars

484
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:39,980
of hazardous chemicals
and 5,000 gallons of diesel fuel.

485
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,540
So, we're not just talking a train here,

486
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,660
we're talking about a missile

487
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,580
the size of the Chrysler building.

488
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,260
So, what is your point, Miss Hooper?

489
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,220
My point is, after it crosses into Finley,

490
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,860
are about 12 miles of vacant farmland.

491
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:55,420
But after that, it's nothing but
town after town.

492
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,580
All the way to Stanton.

493
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,100
We have a very limited window here.

494
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:00,620
So, what are suggesting that
we do, derail it?

495
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,860
Yes, sir, I am.

496
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,460
While we still can.

497
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:14,220
Mr Galvin, I understand that's going
to cost the company a lot of money.

498
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,620
Do you think!?

499
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:18,940
Miss Hooper, we are not intentionally
going to destroy one of our own trains.

500
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,940
Not when we can still stop it.

501
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,420
We can avoid more losses.

502
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,740
I'm going to extend to you, my last ounce
of goodwill, pretend this conversation never happened.

503
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,620
As if I'm worried about my job.

504
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,620
Findlay
Northern Pennsylvania.

505
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,420
Ma'am,

506
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,020
please stay in your van.

507
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:43,980
Let's go.

508
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,260
Please, remain in the van.

509
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,940
You can tell us what's going on.
All crossings are closed off for 20 miles.

510
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,940
Ma'am, for your safety,
you please get back into your van.

511
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:52,060
I'm not getting back into the vehicle,
we need to know what's going on.

512
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,540
Get out of there. Train's coming.

513
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:31,980
Off the line.

514
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,740
1206 to dispatch.
Over.

515
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,380
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

516
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,180
We're not going to fit in that siding,
that's the problem.

517
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,020
1206 to dispatch.
Over.

518
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,020
1206, you in the siding yet.

519
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,660
What's your location?

520
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:27,580
We're not going to make it.

521
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:29,580
Can't do it.
Too much train.

522
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,460
I'm going to need you to realign the
switch so we can proceed to the next siding.

523
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:35,060
1206, you have to get off the main.
Over.

524
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:37,260
I understand. But you have to
understand this. We're not going to fit.

525
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,220
I'll hold.

526
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,580
1206, stand by.

527
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:42,180
That siding is a good 3,000 feet,
head to head.

528
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,700
Check your timetable.

529
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:46,340
It's going to tell you the siding
is 4,111 feet.

530
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,940
But that's the signal to the signal.

531
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:51,500
In reality, it's more like 2,500 feet.

532
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,820
You add those five cars
that YOU picked up.

533
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,900
- We can fit.
- No, we won't fit.

534
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,020
Dispatch, this is 1206.

535
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,420
Can you tell us where the nearest
rip track is?

536
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,340
1206, there's one in 6.2 miles.

537
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,660
How fast are you going?

538
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,300
55 miles an hour.

539
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,340
1206, go faster. Over.

540
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,780
Why, is that coaster still
on the main?

541
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:12,340
1206, Triple 7 is not a coaster.
I repeat, is not a coaster.

542
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,380
Over.

543
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,500
You telling me it's under power?

544
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,300
Get in the God damned siding.

545
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,460
1206, stand by.

546
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:28,980
1206, if you're going for it, that rip
track is confirm vacant.

547
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:32,180
It's your call, Frank. We need to
throw the switch, if you're staying on.

548
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,300
We're both staying on,
pull the brake, Frank.

549
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,100
Pull the brake,.
I know what what the hell I'm doing.

550
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,660
Bullshit, you're gonna get us killed.
Hey!

551
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,940
1206, I need an answer.

552
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,940
Realign it ... the switch.
Over.

553
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,540
Train was just going, no one in it.
It just took off.

554
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:10,100
They were yelling over the radio, earlier.
There was a runaway train coming through.

555
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:13,940
Could be coming to our town next. And, the
high school is right next to those train tracks.

556
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:17,220
Just a few moments ago, this train came
barreling down these tracks.

557
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:20,780
Looking at the numbers?
Should 777 derail,

558
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,260
we're looking at a major disaster.

559
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,620
If one of those Phenol vapor cars blew...

560
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,580
can easily decimate an entire town.

561
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,700
That train is carrying eight of them.

562
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:35,380
Environmental liability, track damage,
car and locomotive loss.

563
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,980
We're looking at a projected cost,
easily over a $100 million.

564
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,980
And the resulting stock devaluation?

565
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:44,180
Our projections indicate,
it could be ... in the

566
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,700
30-40 % range.

567
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,740
I say we vote for Mr Galvin's option.

568
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,420
I've already prepared for a
substation at Bruster,

569
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,940
They just need a go-ahead.

570
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:56,300
You have it.

571
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,780
Okay, everybody out.

572
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:04,820
Hoffman, you stay here, Baker, get me
a track schematic Fuller to Stanton.

573
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,100
This is Owen.

574
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:23,740
71, 70, 71, that's
with a gun.

575
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,340
- So the red means ...
- Triple 7 blew through a signal.

576
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,700
Everything in red means trouble
on the Main line.

577
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:32,980
That's a lot of red.

578
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:35,260
Connie, Mr Galvin on line 2.

579
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,180
This is Connie Hooper.

580
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:42,180
Have all the mainline crossings
been closed?

581
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:44,860
Yes, we have coordinated with PSP.

582
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,300
You have established strategy in place?

583
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,660
It's already under way.

584
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,460
By the activity going
on behind me,

585
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:02,900
it is evident that a plan to
stop the runaway train is under way.

586
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:06,660
But for now,
nobody at AWVR is commenting.

587
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:15,180
We just witnessed AWVR employee, Ryan
Scott, boarding a rescue helicopter.

588
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:19,620
He is a 22 year old Marine vet,
who just returned from Afghanistan.

589
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:27,780
- I now need a police escort, now.

590
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,140
It says here you're a welder?

591
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:34,020
Lead Welder!
Dude, I do got a lot of time.

592
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:36,500
Look, you can call my yard,
and ask for Connie Hooper.

593
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,380
Connie sent you?

594
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,580
That's what I said.
I need your help.

595
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:56,460
1206, this is dispatch.
1206, we ran the math.

596
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:58,380
1206, if you were over 2,000,
you wouldn't have fit.

597
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:00,020
Good call.
Over.

598
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:03,660
Thanks, but need to know
where that train is.

599
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,220
How far away is it?

600
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,220
1206, we're not exactly sure.

601
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,100
You're not sure?
Find out!

602
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:16,340
I'm flying above central
Pennsylvania.

603
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,380
In what emergency responders want to
close all activities along the line.

604
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:22,700
And possibly evacuate all homes within
a mile radius of the track.

605
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:26,180
There's thousands of gallons of fuel
on board, which is highly flammable.

606
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,180
We're still awaiting word on that.

607
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:38,700
This is Galvin's strategy!?

608
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,980
Seems to be a locomotive in front

609
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,740
in an attempt to slow it down.

610
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:53,980
Now we're getting a chopper
and Ryan Scott.

611
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,940
The company still refuses
to comment.

612
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:11,540
We just learned that 26 year
rail company veteran,

613
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:15,180
Judd Stewart, is at the controls of the
engine trying to stop the runaway train.

614
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,700
This one is your plan?
A guy hanging from the helicopter?

615
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,740
Still hauling at 55.

616
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,940
Get her down to 40 and keep braking.

617
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:33,900
Shit.

618
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:50,620
That's it, keep slowing. Get her
down to 40, and we'll send our boy down.

619
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:05,780
Unbelievable.

620
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:06,940
Do it!

621
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:08,340
Come on.

622
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:10,380
Incredibly dangerous maneuver.

623
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,620
Do it! Do it again!

624
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,300
I'm under 40, is he on yet?

625
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:40,460
Come on!

626
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:01,380
Looks like Ryan is injured.

627
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:02,540
He missed.

628
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:03,660
Come on.

629
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:06,900
Just keep braking. Try to slow.
Try to get 777 off the Main.

630
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:10,220
Switch has been thrown.

631
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:22,220
Slow down to hell.

632
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:29,500
Slow down, slow down,
it's going too fast.

633
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,020
Okay, okay.

634
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:06,740
Holy shit.

635
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:09,620
Maybe it derailed.

636
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:13,860
Wow, I can't believe how
horrendous that was.

637
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:17,500
Oh, my God, Galvin you asshole.

638
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:43,820
Fuller yard. Fuller yard.

639
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:44,860
This is 1206.

640
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:48,300
We're passing milepost 5-2,
heading north on Main run.

641
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:50,060
1206, who am I speaking with?

642
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:51,660
Frank Barnes, the engineer.

643
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:53,500
This is Connie Hooper, Yardmaster
at Fuller.

644
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:55,500
Why are you still on the main line?

645
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:59,060
We were directed to a siding that's a
no go. We're heading to a rip track.

646
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:01,260
I just passed milepost 5-0.

647
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:04,340
We need to know the location of your
yard's train.

648
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:06,980
It just passed milepost 47.

649
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:09,060
Holy shit.

650
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:20,380
They tried to side it when it jumped the
switch and derailed the lash-up.

651
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:21,540
Lash-up?

652
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:22,980
Who was driving?

653
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:26,140
Company employee for 26 years,
Judd Stewart was killed today

654
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:28,340
trying to stop the train
in central Pennsylvania.

655
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:29,980
Judd Stewart.

656
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:32,100
Stewart?

657
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:34,100
You said, Stewart?

658
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,700
Judd Stewart, an engineer from Bruster.

659
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,020
You know him?

660
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:52,620
What's you power at the point?

661
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:55,340
5,000 horses. She's not a hot shot,

662
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:58,980
but, she's a ... still got some
life left in her. Over.

663
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:00,300
Give her all you got.

664
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:02,340
Tell Galvin we got two guys on
the Main line, about to

665
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:04,060
to play chicken with our our train.

666
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:13,740
We tried to stop him.
We blew it.

667
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:15,300
That train's gotta go down.

668
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:18,060
- The only question is how to minimizedamage.
- Be quiet.

669
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:20,860
We just learned, there is yet another
train on this track.

670
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:22,980
Headed directly at the runaway.

671
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:24,260
What the hell is that?

672
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:27,780
We got to learn about it on ...
damn TV?

673
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:44,860
Nicole, Nicole, listen, don't hang up.
Don't hang up.

674
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:46,300
Dad, am busy, okay?

675
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:47,940
Well. I just wanted to ...

676
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:49,940
- Dad ...
- I just wanted to say that I love you.

677
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:51,180
Okay, fine.

678
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:54,060
- Dad, what's wrong?
- Nothing, nothing, I just ...

679
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,340
Dad, what's wrong?

680
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:00,500
Tell your sister
I love you both.

681
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:01,740
Okay? I gotta go.

682
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:04,540
What's happening?

683
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:17,300
1206, how you holding up?

684
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:19,500
I'm about a half a mile from that
rip track. Over.

685
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:22,220
Chances are, you're gonna see
the triple 7, any minute.

686
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:24,140
Affirmative.

687
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:38,780
Why are you braking?

688
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:41,820
Trust me. If we head in this hot,
We'll tear right off the track.

689
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:45,020
Jeez.

690
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,140
Get her down to 40 and brace yourself.

691
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:58,300
You need to get at least 10 cars
into the siding.

692
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:05,780
Yes!

693
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:43,340
1206. 1206.

694
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:45,980
I'm at 1206. Go.

695
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:48,300
They're evacuating Arklow.

696
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:50,300
They're going to derail the train.

697
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:51,660
What are they using?

698
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:53,140
Standard dynamite.

699
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:56,100
Going to derail her.

700
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:02,020
What are you doing?

701
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:04,700
I got a look at that last car coupler.
It was open.

702
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:08,860
If we take off right now, we can get back
on the Main. Chase it down in reverse.

703
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:09,980
Woah, wait a minute.

704
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:13,180
No way to stop that kind of power.
Grab it by the tail. Boom!

705
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:14,220
Gun it in the opposite direction.

706
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:16,820
You heard what they said, if that goes
down we'll be a wreck on a wreck.

707
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:18,940
Doesn't matter.

708
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:21,500
Good chance the derailer won't work.

709
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:23,820
It's called a derailer
for Christ's sake.

710
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:26,140
A train of this size,
going that fast

711
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:28,340
- It will vaporize anything that gets inits way.
- Bullshit!

712
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:30,620
- They wouldn't use it.
- They're wrong, all right?

713
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:32,060
They're wrong.

714
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:33,620
Are you in or are you not?

715
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:35,900
If you want to get yourself killed,
you do it alone.

716
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:38,060
You know what? Ask your wife what she feels.

717
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:39,660
Wait.

718
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:47,260
If you are right and the derailer fails,
what are the odds it makes it to Stanton?

719
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:49,260
You saw the train. What do you think?

720
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:16,540
1206, this is Connie Hooper,
Are you there?

721
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:20,020
1206, Over.

722
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:21,700
I wanted to see how you boys
are doing.

723
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:26,700
We're doing about 60 miles
an hour, Connie.

724
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:30,260
Sorry ... I don't understand.

725
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:31,980
We're going after your train.

726
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:34,060
1206, I'm not hearing you.

727
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:35,420
The rear knuckle was left open, so

728
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:38,420
if we can catch up,
we can tie it on our locomotive.

729
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:39,940
Try and slow down triple 7.

730
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:42,260
- Frank, you can't.
- We've already are.

731
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:44,180
One derailer's not going to cut it,
Connie.

732
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:46,100
Who said anything about the derailer?

733
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:50,500
Dispatch. He said they were to evacuate
Arklow. Two plus two is four.

734
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:54,060
- It's Ned, says he's still following.
- No, tell him we'll call him back.

735
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:55,500
Get me to Galvin, now!

736
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:59,340
Frank, that train carrying 30,000
gallons of toxic chemicals.

737
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:00,580
They had a window before.

738
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:03,020
But that train's going into
populated areas.

739
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:04,540
There's no way they derail, now.

740
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:08,180
Are you sure about that?

741
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:13,180
- Look, let me make some calls.
- Make some calls, please!

742
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:24,100
What do you think?
You think he can catch up?

743
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:26,220
Well, possibly.

744
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:29,780
But even if they do, we're talking about
coupling at 10 times the normal speed.

745
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:31,100
In reverse...

746
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:33,260
I thought you were in favor of derailment.

747
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,940
Yeah, yeah, when they were in the
middle of nowhere.

748
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:36,700
Not now, when its just
town after town out there.

749
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:38,500
Mr. Galvin says he'll have
to call you back.

750
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:40,820
This is Connie Hooper for Mr. Galvin.

751
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:42,340
Mr. Galvin has a meeting.

752
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:45,620
Then maybe you can tell me. Is the company
planning on derailing Triple 7?

753
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:48,100
Last I heard, Galvin was
dead-set against it.

754
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:51,180
Sorry, I'd like to help, but can't.

755
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:53,860
No, of course you're not at liberty to.

756
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:55,500
Frank's right.

757
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:04,820
How fast do you think is a single
engine like this?

758
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:06,940
- Unattached?
- Yeah.

759
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:09,220
50, 55

760
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:11,380
But, that was going forward.

761
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:13,060
1206, you there?

762
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:15,220
This is 1206, Over.

763
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:16,260
Frank, you're right.

764
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:17,860
About the derailment ...

765
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:20,740
They're planning an attempt
outside of Arklow.

766
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:27,100
Tell them idiots it ain't gonna work.
That portable derailer is worthless.

767
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:28,420
She already told us.

768
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:33,020
Frank, this is Oscar Galvin,
v.p. of operations.

769
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:35,860
Patched in at his request, open mike.

770
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,780
Yeah, we are derailing Triple 7, Frank.

771
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:40,220
It's a done decision.

772
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:42,820
Like it or not, it's
our best option at this stage.

773
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:45,140
Less collateral damage in Arklow.

774
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:49,260
It's already being evacuated. And, we can't
let Triple 7 make it to Stanton.

775
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:53,580
Look, Mr Galvin, with all due respect,
I've been railroading for 28 years.

776
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:56,740
I'm telling you we got a real chance
to stop this thing.

777
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:57,980
No, we already tried.

778
00:52:58,380 --> 00:52:59,900
That was from the front.

779
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:01,460
We're long hood, lean back.

780
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:02,900
It's a different situation.

781
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:04,700
We got more control now.

782
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:09,940
What if I cancel the derailer,
and you fail, Frank? Huh...

783
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:14,140
The train will be doing 70 MPH
into that elevated "S" curve at Stanton.

784
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:15,940
The damage will be 100 times worse.

785
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:18,140
Right, I'm just telling you,

786
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:20,700
the portable derailer is worthless.

787
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:23,740
You got too much train travelling
entirely too fast.

788
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:27,180
Maybe 1206 should just stay on
it as a back up.

789
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:31,020
But, I am not jeopardizing more
personnel and more property,

790
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:34,100
just because some engineer
wants to play hero.

791
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:35,540
End of discussion.

792
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:38,780
That train is our property,
it's our decision.

793
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:42,820
Now, you stop your pursuit
or I will fire you.

794
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:46,180
You already did.

795
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:51,460
Already did what?

796
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:54,340
You've already fired me.

797
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:57,980
I received my 90 days notice
in the mail,

798
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:00,220
72 days ago.

799
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:03,460
Forced early retirement, half benefits.

800
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:13,820
So you're gonna risk your life for us,
with three weeks left?

801
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:17,020
Not for you ...

802
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:20,380
I'm not doing it for you.

803
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:22,460
Frank ...

804
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:24,260
Give me that.

805
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:30,980
Mr Galvin, this is Will Colson,
your conductor.

806
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:36,100
I'm letting you know,
we're gonna run this bitch down.

807
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:40,620
Maybe you didn't hear what I just said,
Colson. I will fire you!

808
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:43,620
That's too bad.

809
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:46,460
I was just starting to like his job.

810
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:50,020
Damn it, you listen to me.

811
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:52,340
Son of a bitch, you will be fired.

812
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:54,380
You're breaking up.
Sorry ...

813
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:03,460
- This garbage, is not ...
- I think they're gone.

814
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:08,540
Well, this is your headache, now, Hooper.

815
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:12,500
Now, you get them off the Main or
consider yourself shitcanned, too.

816
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:15,460
I like that.

817
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:18,340
Bring up the slides of Arklow.

818
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:22,380
Take a look behind me and see emergency
evacuation efforts are currently in effect

819
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:24,860
right here in the tiny town of Arklow.

820
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:38,780
1206 to Fuller yard.
Connie, are you there? Over.

821
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:42,460
- Frank ... I'm real sorry about Galvin.
- It's okay. Listen, listen.

822
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:44,460
- Is he off?
- Yeah, he's gone

823
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:45,620
OK, listen up.

824
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:47,420
I want you to do us a favor.

825
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:51,460
I need you to keep us posted on the speed
and location of Triple 7.

826
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:53,100
Location and speed.
Over.

827
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:56,540
Connie?

828
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:02,140
Frank, Triple 7 is 9 miles out of
Arklow. You got some catching up to do.

829
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:03,460
9 miles out of Arklow.

830
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:21,220
- What did you say your wife's first name?
- Darcy.

831
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:23,620
So, what's the long story
you didn't want to make long?

832
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,700
I came home from work
two weeks ago, and she's uh ...

833
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:31,900
texting on the phone.
I asked her who and she told me, nobody.

834
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:34,780
I said "let me see the phone"
and she says, no.

835
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:36,100
And, this goes on...

836
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,020
- Five, six times ...
- Wait, wait, you're losing me.

837
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:41,580
- She's texting? - There's this guy
we both went to school with.

838
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:43,700
He's a cop. He's a PA state trooper.

839
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:45,980
He's always had a thing for Darcy,
since we met.

840
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:47,540
1206, where are you?

841
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:51,620
1206, here Connie.
I just passed milepost 57.

842
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:53,540
You are about a mile and a half behind.

843
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:57,460
How far out of Arklow is Triple 7?

844
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:59,900
7 1/2 miles, it picked upspeed.
You better step on it.

845
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:03,580
I'm stepping on it. In and around it,
through it, Connie. Thank you. Over.

846
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:09,180
And the phone messages continued and
each time she continued to deny.

847
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:12,140
She starts to walk away. I grab for it.

848
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:14,620
- Did you hit her?
- No, no.

849
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:18,980
I mean, I scared her but
I didn't hurt her.

850
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:23,780
Well, anyway, I drive to this guys house,
to talk,

851
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:25,260
that among men, in my car.

852
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:28,340
He started to tell me that I got it
all wrong. They're just friends

853
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:30,820
and he stops when he sees

854
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:33,660
the gun I got sitting on the ...
- Oooh!

855
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:39,100
She's my wife, you find another friend.

856
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:41,420
- You pulled a gun on a cop?
- Frank?

857
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:44,740
Frank, Triple 7 has just passed
milepost 61.

858
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:47,300
Thank you, Connie.

859
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:49,300
- Want to hear the kicker?
- Yes, I do.

860
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:53,500
It wasn't even him that was texting her.
It was my sister-in-law.

861
00:57:54,820 --> 00:57:57,700
Hey, by the time I got home,
his buddy is waiting for me.

862
00:57:57,740 --> 00:58:00,500
Just waiting to serve me
with a restraining order.

863
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:04,540
Darcy wouldn't even looked at me.

864
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:09,420
So, now I'm living with my brother.

865
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:13,460
There was a hearing today. The judge
ordered a 30 day extension.

866
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:18,580
It's like, one day, everything is going
Okay, and then...

867
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:22,500
the next, it's all falling apart
faster than you can put it back together.

868
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:24,580
Yeah ... never too late, though.

869
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:38,420
The plan to derail this 39 car
runaway train is just minutes away now.

870
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:42,980
...tremendous amount of activity going on.
Will this train be able to be stopped.

871
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:50,420
1206, Connie, just passed
milepost 62. Milepost 62. Over.

872
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:52,340
There's still a mile gap,
maybe more.

873
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:54,060
We are gaining on him, Frank.

874
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:55,740
Hold on tight.

875
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:02,980
Just want to shot trains.

876
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:06,540
Okay, we go
Come, Be ready. It's moment of truth.

877
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:08,660
Just north of Arklow.

878
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:13,940
OK, Remember, it's a Red button!

879
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:19,900
Now!

880
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:25,460
Open fire! Open fire!
Damn!

881
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:26,980
Open fire!

882
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:31,740
We were aiming at the same level, by firing
shotgun rounds at the fuel stop safety switch.

883
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:33,660
And So ... some shots were fired.

884
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:36,500
That safety switch is a mighty small target

885
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:38,980
and, it's right nex to a fuel tank.

886
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:45,580
We're not going to catch him before Arklow.

887
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:47,260
Frank, you're closing the gap.

888
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:50,780
You should cut your speed, allow
yourself some stopping distance, just in case.

889
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:54,060
No can do, Connie.
If we slow down now, we'll never catch him.

890
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:55,420
Not before Stanton.
Over.

891
00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:56,540
It's your call.

892
00:59:57,340 --> 00:59:58,940
However, we have now also learned,

893
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:00,580
that two railroad employees

894
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:04,820
are now in pursuit of train 777
in a single locomotive.

895
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:06,740
It is unclear what's their plan ...

896
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:08,260
Connie Hooper for you.

897
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:11,860
Did I or did I not tell you
to get 1206 off the Main?

898
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:13,940
I asked them nicely.
...This is impossible!

899
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:23,460
- You're 100 % sure that derailer won'twork?
- Yes. 100 %.

900
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,500
- Now
- Which one is it?

901
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:29,860
- 50-50.
- 25.

902
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:31,580
And if it does?

903
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:35,540
If does ... then we're
a wreck on a wreck.

904
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:40,420
I'am with engineer Jim Deveroux.
The train is getting close.

905
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:41,500
How will this derailer work?

906
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:43,900
Well, basically, it works like a ramp.

907
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:48,380
Train comes along, this piece here,
will lift the flange

908
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:50,020
and and pull it outside the rail.

909
01:00:50,140 --> 01:00:53,900
That will cause the train
to flip over on its right hand side.

910
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:55,980
Son of a bitch won't even know...

911
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:33,860
What ... What in the hell was that?

912
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:37,860
That ... was 10 million pounds of train,
Mr Galvin.

913
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:40,220
And, this is the sound of me
saving your ass.

914
01:01:41,020 --> 01:01:42,260
Frank, do you copy?

915
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:45,540
- Frank?
- 1206. Over.

916
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:47,580
You were right.

917
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:50,780
Jesus Christ!

918
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:01,940
Bringing you live coverage right now of
what could very well result

919
01:02:02,020 --> 01:02:06,740
in one of the worst disasters in the
history of the state of Pennsylvania.

920
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:08,660
The particulars are still
being examined, but

921
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:10,380
authorities are far more focused

922
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:13,980
on the potential destruction that would
result if train 777

923
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:16,620
were to derail in Stanton.

924
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:22,860
What did you mean
about being married once?

925
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:26,700
Alice, my wife ...she died of cancer.

926
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:29,100
- Four years ago.
- Sorry.

927
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:30,740
Me too ...

928
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:32,860
Me too.

929
01:02:34,940 --> 01:02:36,500
Every night I come home,

930
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:38,620
tell her about my day ...

931
01:02:38,780 --> 01:02:40,180
where I had been ...

932
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:42,060
what I hauled.

933
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:46,460
Who annoyed me.

934
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:50,300
- You can offend someone?
- You'd be amazed.

935
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:54,260
You should call your wife.

936
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:57,980
I would but ... but it's her day off.
She's probably sleeping.

937
01:02:58,100 --> 01:02:59,900
Don't make excuses. Wake her up.

938
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:04,060
I called her for the past 2 weeks,
but she never called me back.

939
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:06,660
She won't. You got to call her,
that's how it works.

940
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:08,500
You quit too easy.

941
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:15,660
Stanton, Pennsylvania.

942
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:16,820
Darcy!

943
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:19,100
Darcy.

944
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:23,340
I've been calling...
and calling.

945
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:26,420
What is wrong?

946
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:28,340
As we told you earlier today,

947
01:03:28,420 --> 01:03:31,780
those emergency evacuations
began early this morning.

948
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:34,020
As they try to move people out of
harms way.

949
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:41,980
Yeah, I know, I'm watching TV.

950
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:45,820
Arklow, Pennnsylvannia

951
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:02,020
Two railroad employees are presently in
pursuit of Train 777

952
01:04:02,060 --> 01:04:03,460
in a single locomotive.

953
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:07,980
No one seems exactly clear on what their
plans are to catch up with that train.

954
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:11,500
We just learned the railroad employee,
Frank Barnes,

955
01:04:11,740 --> 01:04:14,020
a 28 year veteran of the
the train company responsible

956
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,580
for the runaway

957
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:17,100
and Will Colson, a conductor,

958
01:04:17,180 --> 01:04:18,620
Are now on board other ...

959
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:20,180
Yes, we're on our way.

960
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:27,300
And get this. They were travelling
at speeds up to 70 MPH ... in reverse.

961
01:04:27,740 --> 01:04:29,860
Triple 7 is now just
miles away

962
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:33,300
the more populated town of Stanton.

963
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:38,060
Let's go, boys!

964
01:04:57,420 --> 01:05:01,260
You're getting close, gap is but a mile
and Triple 7 is 10 miles to Stanton.

965
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:02,340
Now, listen, Frank.

966
01:05:02,420 --> 01:05:04,460
I got a guy here named Werner from
the FRA...

967
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:06,260
Now, I'm inclined to divert your
judgement here, but he ...

968
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:09,260
All right. Put him on.
We can use all the help that we can get.

969
01:05:11,260 --> 01:05:12,860
Press this and hold to talk.

970
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:18,380
It's about slowing down Triple 7,
once you've tied on. I know...

971
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:21,940
I know conventional wisdon says to just
gun it in the opposite direction.

972
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:23,860
But, you'll have a better shot

973
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:26,380
alternating full trottle
with dynamic braking.

974
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:28,980
Yeah. But we can't afford
to lose counter-trust.

975
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:32,940
What you'll lose in counter-trust
will compensate for in traction force.

976
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:34,860
Are you sure about that?

977
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:40,140
Well, it's more of a hunch based on
some quick calculations.

978
01:05:40,620 --> 01:05:41,860
It's a hunch!?

979
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:44,940
We're going 70 MPH and
he gives us a hunch.

980
01:05:45,020 --> 01:05:47,980
Okay, thank you.
Put Connie back on, please.

981
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:51,340
- It's me, Frank. - Yeah, Connie,
this guy know what he's talking about?

982
01:05:53,660 --> 01:05:55,140
In a perfect world ...

983
01:05:56,180 --> 01:05:57,900
Yes. I would says, yes.

984
01:05:58,100 --> 01:05:59,700
In a perfect world, okay.

985
01:06:00,020 --> 01:06:03,060
We now have more now on that runaway
freight train in rural Pennsylvania,

986
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:05,900
we've been advised of an ambitous plan
to bring it to a stop.

987
01:06:05,980 --> 01:06:08,540
A single locomotive moves in from behind

988
01:06:08,580 --> 01:06:10,260
catches up... hooks up

989
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:12,940
and then brakes
in an effort to slow it down.

990
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:17,180
We passed milepost 76, Connie.
Over.

991
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:20,060
- You're only half mile away.
- Half mile. Over.

992
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:22,660
Frank, running in reverse,
how are you going to gauge our gap distance?

993
01:06:25,620 --> 01:06:27,820
I'll go out there and signal you by hand.

994
01:06:29,580 --> 01:06:31,660
- At 70 MPH?
- I ask you, you need help?

995
01:06:35,180 --> 01:06:36,140
All right.

996
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:38,700
Radio and hand signs to communicate.
Okay?

997
01:06:38,780 --> 01:06:40,180
- Now, be careful.
- I will.

998
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:42,700
- And, oh, take that vest off.
- Why?

999
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:46,460
Just take it off. I do not want to look out
this window and see a yellow vest. Freak me out.

1000
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:06,460
Come on, answer.

1001
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:10,300
Come on.

1002
01:07:10,420 --> 01:07:12,580
- Leave me a message...
- Damn.

1003
01:07:18,340 --> 01:07:19,300
Come on, Frank.

1004
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:20,820
Trying. Over.

1005
01:07:26,580 --> 01:07:28,140
All right, here she comes.

1006
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:33,220
3 cars?

1007
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:36,180
Three cars, steady. Copy.

1008
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:40,420
All right. Steady! Steady!

1009
01:07:48,780 --> 01:07:50,020
Two cars?

1010
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:54,420
Yeah, two cars. Steady.
Steady on one.

1011
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:00,220
Keep it coming. Keep it coming.

1012
01:08:04,620 --> 01:08:05,980
Keep it coming!

1013
01:08:06,540 --> 01:08:08,020
Steady! ... Steady!

1014
01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:09,500
Plan go into operation

1015
01:08:09,580 --> 01:08:13,860
Will Colson is tring to hook up 1206 with
Triple 7. Coulson, the conductor...

1016
01:08:18,740 --> 01:08:20,060
It seems something is terribly wrong.

1017
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:28,020
Will, what was that?

1018
01:08:29,340 --> 01:08:31,180
Lost brake fluid.

1019
01:08:32,340 --> 01:08:34,020
Are we tied on?

1020
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:37,020
Will, what's going on?

1021
01:08:37,980 --> 01:08:42,220
Right now we are looking at live
pictures of this rescue operation

1022
01:08:42,260 --> 01:08:43,780
Are we tied on?

1023
01:08:44,740 --> 01:08:47,220
No, fricking thing didn't work.
I'll try again.

1024
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:49,820
Will, use hand signals.

1025
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:00,460
Are we tied on?

1026
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:01,700
We're good, we're good.

1027
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:11,300
Shit!

1028
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:13,620
Frank, I fell hook.

1029
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:15,620
Repeat. What?

1030
01:09:15,740 --> 01:09:17,180
Are we tied in..

1031
01:09:17,660 --> 01:09:19,660
The locking hook pin didn't fall.

1032
01:09:19,940 --> 01:09:20,900
What?

1033
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:23,580
Pin didn't fall.
It's not a locked-in.

1034
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:25,220
Okay, well, look.

1035
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:29,580
Try to get down to see what
you can do. Be careful.

1036
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:31,180
Be careful.

1037
01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:40,980
Will.

1038
01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:43,860
Not slowing down, it's
gaining right speed now.

1039
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:46,460
He's reaching down
trying to couple...

1040
01:09:55,180 --> 01:09:56,540
Will, can you read me?

1041
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:11,300
He's gone.

1042
01:10:14,860 --> 01:10:17,940
Will Colson is down.
We do not see him.

1043
01:10:19,580 --> 01:10:21,340
Helicopter 43, can you zoom in

1044
01:10:22,540 --> 01:10:24,380
do not see that conductor, Colson.

1045
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:25,900
Come on, baby.

1046
01:10:29,540 --> 01:10:31,220
Will, can you read me?

1047
01:10:31,580 --> 01:10:32,540
Will!

1048
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:47,500
Chopper 43, zoom in.
There is Will Colson.

1049
01:10:52,980 --> 01:10:56,060
Looks like Will Colson is in trouble.

1050
01:10:57,780 --> 01:10:58,940
Shit.

1051
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:04,780
Will.

1052
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:07,660
We are now being told, that the
connection has been made.

1053
01:11:08,620 --> 01:11:11,980
It looks as though this train is
now attached to 1206.

1054
01:11:12,460 --> 01:11:15,340
1206 is successfuly attached
to the Triple 7.

1055
01:11:15,620 --> 01:11:17,980
It looks like Will Colson is injured.

1056
01:11:19,580 --> 01:11:20,620
All right?

1057
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:24,060
I'm great.

1058
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:27,260
Don't touch that, don't touch that.

1059
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:31,780
Just wrap it up with this.
Wrap it real tight. All around.

1060
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:34,940
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, great.

1061
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:41,060
Colson has caught up to the runaway train
and .....

1062
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:41,940
Let's go, Darcy.

1063
01:11:42,020 --> 01:11:45,580
But the train continues to speed in
excess of 75 miles an hour.

1064
01:11:45,620 --> 01:11:47,260
Heading to Stanton.

1065
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:51,420
Connie, how far got?

1066
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:52,980
How far is Stanton?
Over.

1067
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:57,180
4 miles. You guys are doing great.

1068
01:11:57,380 --> 01:11:59,500
But, you're cutting it close, though.
How's Will?

1069
01:12:00,540 --> 01:12:02,780
He's, uh ...
He's different. Over.

1070
01:12:02,980 --> 01:12:04,020
Done.

1071
01:12:06,820 --> 01:12:08,540
You ready for a little tug-of-war?

1072
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:10,780
Let s do it.

1073
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:21,180
Match our speed with theirs ...

1074
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:31,860
- Frank Roth.
- I know. Only scratches, that's all.

1075
01:12:32,060 --> 01:12:33,020
Scratches.

1076
01:12:38,860 --> 01:12:43,180
Here in Stanton, the evacuation procedures
continue for the entire town.

1077
01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:47,580
This is the town where the that main line
train track turns into an elevated curve.

1078
01:12:47,820 --> 01:12:51,540
They say there is virtually no chance that
this speeding, out of control train

1079
01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:52,980
Will make it through that curve.

1080
01:12:59,220 --> 01:13:00,660
Please slow down.

1081
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:02,780
But I'll do.

1082
01:13:03,620 --> 01:13:04,700
Shit.

1083
01:13:05,940 --> 01:13:07,180
Now the dynamics.

1084
01:13:07,580 --> 01:13:09,580
Open easily.

1085
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:22,980
Christ, slowing down.
Seems to be working.

1086
01:13:25,340 --> 01:13:26,580
Come on, Frank.

1087
01:13:26,980 --> 01:13:28,020
Come on, baby.

1088
01:13:33,860 --> 01:13:34,940
What's the speed?

1089
01:13:35,020 --> 01:13:36,380
We're under 50.

1090
01:13:36,460 --> 01:13:38,100
Connie, how far away?

1091
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:40,980
3 miles. We have men on the
ground ready to hop on board.

1092
01:13:41,060 --> 01:13:44,060
- As soon as you guys get it under control.
- Tell them to be ready to hop. Over.

1093
01:13:52,100 --> 01:13:53,300
Shit!

1094
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:03,340
- What is it?
- Gaining speed.

1095
01:14:03,620 --> 01:14:06,140
The systems is too heavy.
Being dragged.

1096
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:15,900
Connie!

1097
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:17,700
I'm here, Frank.

1098
01:14:17,780 --> 01:14:19,620
We're going to be coming in too hot.

1099
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:21,620
I do not know.

1100
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:24,740
Limit on that curve that is 15.
I do not know if you can take it much faster.

1101
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:27,060
Maybe 20, 25, max.

1102
01:14:27,140 --> 01:14:28,420
We may not have a choice.

1103
01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:30,620
Just tell them it's going
to be real hot.

1104
01:14:36,220 --> 01:14:38,580
What about the braking
of the freight cars?

1105
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:43,260
Good, good.

1106
01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:45,380
- All right, I'm on it.
- No, no. Sit down. No, no.

1107
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:46,980
I've got it. Sit tight. Sit tight.
I'll go.

1108
01:14:47,060 --> 01:14:50,660
No, no, come on. You better stay here
and I go out.

1109
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:52,500
Just keep it at 4.

1110
01:14:53,940 --> 01:14:54,980
- You, all right? Take it easy.
- Yeah.

1111
01:14:55,180 --> 01:14:58,460
Hold that dynamic out, 4,
4, with the trottle combined.

1112
01:14:58,460 --> 01:15:01,420
Hold it up at 4, how you run the
clock out, doesn't matter.

1113
01:15:02,780 --> 01:15:04,380
Hey, don't get sentimental on me.

1114
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:06,700
Makes me think I'm gonna die.
Just hold it at 4.

1115
01:15:26,780 --> 01:15:27,740
Come on, Frank.

1116
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:30,700
WAVR officials have no comment.

1117
01:15:31,100 --> 01:15:33,900
Barnes is attempting to manually
brake the last car.

1118
01:15:44,660 --> 01:15:46,580
Actually, Barnes is
on the train

1119
01:15:46,620 --> 01:15:47,700
leaping over cars.

1120
01:15:47,780 --> 01:15:49,460
Let's go, Frank.

1121
01:15:57,380 --> 01:15:59,980
Looks like Triple 7 is slowing down.

1122
01:16:07,180 --> 01:16:08,620
Come on Dad, Kill it.

1123
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:13,860
Will, how fast are you going?

1124
01:16:17,180 --> 01:16:18,140
34.

1125
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:22,540
We're dropping, 33 ...

1126
01:16:25,140 --> 01:16:26,100
Think it'll work?

1127
01:16:29,180 --> 01:16:30,300
Theoretically.

1128
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:33,420
Provided, that locomotive's independent
brake holds up.

1129
01:16:40,580 --> 01:16:44,540
We continue to bring you live coverage of
this breaking news event from the town of Stanton.

1130
01:16:44,540 --> 01:16:47,500
Emergency officials have created
this perimeter ...

1131
01:16:52,060 --> 01:16:56,060
Please evacuate the building,
immediately.

1132
01:17:30,220 --> 01:17:31,180
Damn!

1133
01:17:33,580 --> 01:17:34,620
Frank.

1134
01:17:35,420 --> 01:17:36,980
Yeah, yeah, I hear you, I hear you.

1135
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:39,060
We just lost our brakes.

1136
01:17:41,860 --> 01:17:44,420
- They lost their brakes. High flames ...
- Shit.

1137
01:17:54,140 --> 01:17:55,740
Frank, Frank, you all right?

1138
01:17:56,460 --> 01:17:58,060
I'm here, Will, what happened?

1139
01:17:58,940 --> 01:18:00,740
We're picking up speed, again.

1140
01:18:02,660 --> 01:18:04,580
Can you still slow him down?

1141
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:06,300
We're almost at the curve.

1142
01:18:06,700 --> 01:18:08,540
Frank, our engine block's overheated.

1143
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:14,980
I don't think those handbrakes are
going to stop it, going too fast.

1144
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:17,860
Just hang on to the independent.

1145
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:18,980
I'll tell you when.

1146
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:42,900
Elevated and strictly class 2
speed restricted to 15 miles per hour.

1147
01:18:43,180 --> 01:18:46,740
Impact with three of these buildings
directly below will be unavoidable..

1148
01:18:46,820 --> 01:18:50,300
..As will contact with all of the
fuel storage tanks situated here.

1149
01:18:50,460 --> 01:18:51,620
Will.

1150
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:53,180
Will?

1151
01:18:53,540 --> 01:18:56,420
Okay, okay, but we take speed again.

1152
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:10,060
Will!

1153
01:19:11,300 --> 01:19:12,940
We're coming into the curve!

1154
01:19:13,340 --> 01:19:14,660
Get ready!

1155
01:19:27,820 --> 01:19:28,780
Will!

1156
01:19:29,060 --> 01:19:30,620
Get on the independent!

1157
01:19:31,260 --> 01:19:33,500
The independentele is hard to get.

1158
01:19:40,380 --> 01:19:41,980
We're going to jump right off.

1159
01:19:42,020 --> 01:19:43,780
We have no choice.

1160
01:19:53,060 --> 01:19:54,020
Will!

1161
01:19:54,140 --> 01:19:55,380
Hang on!

1162
01:20:03,380 --> 01:20:05,460
Try, try again.

1163
01:20:06,700 --> 01:20:07,660
Now!

1164
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:34,460
Frank, you all right?

1165
01:20:34,460 --> 01:20:35,540
We made it!

1166
01:20:35,620 --> 01:20:37,020
We made it!
Through the turn!

1167
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:42,140
Triple 7 did it. It made it through
the Staton curve.

1168
01:20:42,700 --> 01:20:46,060
Triple 7 is through the Stanton curve,
but, by no means out of trouble.

1169
01:20:46,460 --> 01:20:50,580
Triple 7 is gaining speed, it is
out of control, and has to derail.

1170
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:53,940
Frank Barnes and Will Colson will be
the victims of the

1171
01:20:54,060 --> 01:20:56,620
biggest rail disaster
the history of the north-east.

1172
01:20:58,820 --> 01:21:01,420
It looks like Frank Barnes is
making an all out effort...

1173
01:21:03,420 --> 01:21:07,180
This is a remarkable effort, now, to
get to the front of Triple 7.

1174
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:13,500
Frank!

1175
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:17,740
Frank, we're 60 and we're gonna
hit 80 in no time.

1176
01:21:21,780 --> 01:21:23,020
He's not going to make it.

1177
01:21:24,180 --> 01:21:26,580
It looks like the gap between cars
has stopped him.

1178
01:21:26,620 --> 01:21:27,540
Come on, Dad.

1179
01:21:27,620 --> 01:21:31,580
But the train continues to speed
in excess of 75 miles an hour.

1180
01:21:31,580 --> 01:21:32,540
Frank.

1181
01:21:33,220 --> 01:21:34,300
Frank!

1182
01:21:34,820 --> 01:21:36,860
Will! We got a problem here!

1183
01:21:38,780 --> 01:21:40,580
I do not think I can make it!

1184
01:21:43,260 --> 01:21:44,220
Oh, God!

1185
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:53,780
Who's that?

1186
01:21:57,780 --> 01:21:58,820
Unbelievable!

1187
01:21:59,020 --> 01:22:00,180
Unbelievable.

1188
01:22:04,300 --> 01:22:05,260
Hello.

1189
01:22:05,380 --> 01:22:06,460
Ned, it's Connie.

1190
01:22:06,540 --> 01:22:08,620
I'm a little busy right now, Connie.
I'll Call you back.

1191
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:34,460
Come on!

1192
01:22:39,140 --> 01:22:40,980
Jump into the back of the car!

1193
01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:44,700
Hop into the back of the truck!

1194
01:22:45,020 --> 01:22:45,980
Connie!

1195
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:47,980
Connie, is that truck for us?

1196
01:22:48,020 --> 01:22:50,100
Yes it is, Will. You can do this.

1197
01:22:50,860 --> 01:22:52,260
Come on, you can do this.

1198
01:22:58,460 --> 01:22:59,500
Come on.

1199
01:23:12,380 --> 01:23:16,220
It looks like he's trying to synchronize
with the speed of the train.

1200
01:23:17,260 --> 01:23:20,140
Jump, you pussy!
Jump in the back!

1201
01:23:30,980 --> 01:23:31,860
Yes!

1202
01:23:38,660 --> 01:23:40,860
Look at what's happening now.
The red pick-up...

1203
01:23:40,900 --> 01:23:42,220
racing toward the end of the train.

1204
01:23:42,260 --> 01:23:43,220
Come on!

1205
01:23:52,580 --> 01:23:53,660
Frank!

1206
01:23:55,380 --> 01:23:58,140
Go, Go, Go!

1207
01:23:59,300 --> 01:24:00,540
Go, go, go!

1208
01:24:00,940 --> 01:24:02,460
Go, go!

1209
01:24:13,460 --> 01:24:16,340
Now WIll is running out of parallel road


1210
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:17,740
Come on, Will.

1211
01:24:17,820 --> 01:24:18,900
Come on, Come on!

1212
01:24:40,020 --> 01:24:41,260
Come on!

1213
01:24:41,820 --> 01:24:43,860
God damn it, over shot it.

1214
01:24:47,020 --> 01:24:47,900
Come on.

1215
01:24:48,180 --> 01:24:50,660
Come on, damn! Do it!

1216
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:53,260
Come on, jump!

1217
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:55,100
Do it! Jump!

1218
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:14,460
Yes!

1219
01:25:15,260 --> 01:25:16,380
Yes!

1220
01:25:25,660 --> 01:25:26,780
Yes!

1221
01:25:29,820 --> 01:25:30,900
Oh, God!

1222
01:25:34,780 --> 01:25:39,260
Colson, successfully making it in to
the cab, now he controls.

1223
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:04,060
Job of reporting 43 to you,
this remarkable aftermath.

1224
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:06,700
We're talking about the heroic work
of two men...

1225
01:26:06,820 --> 01:26:08,540
Frank Barnes and Will Colson.

1226
01:26:08,820 --> 01:26:12,460
Southern Pennsylvania
will always indebted to them.

1227
01:26:36,180 --> 01:26:38,260
Missed Call
Darcy.

1228
01:26:57,220 --> 01:26:58,260
We did It.

1229
01:26:58,540 --> 01:27:00,580
I knew that when there's a job here we do it.


1230
01:27:01,780 --> 01:27:03,180
Good accuracy.

1231
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:04,660
Good job, kid.

1232
01:27:37,620 --> 01:27:38,900
- Ned! - Ned!
- You!

1233
01:27:39,060 --> 01:27:40,420
Ned, were you worried?

1234
01:27:40,620 --> 01:27:42,900
If I worried?
No, not really.

1235
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:44,780
It's all about precision.

1236
01:27:44,820 --> 01:27:45,980
I was and she says she ...

1237
01:27:46,180 --> 01:27:48,300
- Your flowers are going corporate, you know
- Yes?

1238
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:50,020
Debt of gratitude ... blah, blah, blah.

1239
01:27:50,220 --> 01:27:51,260
Same here.

1240
01:27:51,740 --> 01:27:53,100
They are pretty good, actually.

1241
01:27:53,260 --> 01:27:54,620
Yes, it did.

1242
01:27:58,540 --> 01:28:01,060
What was your first reaction when you
realized what was happening?

1243
01:28:01,100 --> 01:28:03,300
I felt I was in my comfort zone.

1244
01:28:03,380 --> 01:28:06,260
- Mine was about my job?
- So was mine, didn't want to leave it.

1245
01:28:10,020 --> 01:28:12,660
- You'd be stupid enough to do it.
- Yeah. That's what I told them.

1246
01:28:16,060 --> 01:28:18,140
So, they better think about giving
me a medal, too.

1247
01:28:18,700 --> 01:28:20,780
- But me?
- What about you?

1248
01:28:28,020 --> 01:28:31,340
Do you have any better of an idea
as to how this happened?

1249
01:28:31,380 --> 01:28:35,540
- Do you want to you know how it happened?
- Thank you very much evry body ...You had an experience.

1250
01:28:37,380 --> 01:28:38,420
Sir?

1251
01:28:38,580 --> 01:28:40,140
I wonder if you can help me.

1252
01:28:41,180 --> 01:28:43,980
- Connie?
- I can't decide which one of you I'm going to kiss first.

1253
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:45,140
Me!

1254
01:28:46,340 --> 01:28:48,580
Problem solved.

1255
01:28:49,340 --> 01:28:51,540
- Get him, Connie.
- Okay, bring it on.

1256
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:02,080
Your Daughters?

1257
01:29:07,100 --> 01:29:09,300
Chopper 43,...
Over, and out.
