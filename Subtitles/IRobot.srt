1
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,150
Thing of beauty.

2
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,320
Good morning, sir.

3
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,160
Yet another
on-time delivery from--

4
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,330
Get the hell
out of my face, canner.

5
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:29,540
Have a nice day.

6
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:36,420
And we believe
our Destination Anywhere package
to be the best value.

7
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,920
Let us take you to your dream destination
aboard our orbital space-plane--

8
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,400
Glowfish.
The world's hot-selling transgenic treat.

9
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,780
Excuse me, sir.

10
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,530
Total readiness. Total security.

11
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,040
So good-bye to lengthy upgrades
and service calls.

12
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,120
An uplink to U.S.R.'s central computer
provides this state-of-the-art robot...

13
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,120
with new programs daily.

14
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:17,250
The Nestor Class 5
is tomorrow's robot today.

15
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:21,420
Spoon! Spoonie!

16
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,760
Hey!

17
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,300
Uh-- Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

18
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,560
Hey, man!
- Spoon, man, where you been at?

19
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,560
- Just away, Farber.
- Oh, yeah, away?

20
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,690
Like vacation and stuff?
That's real nice, man.

21
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:37,110
Listen. I got a favor to ask.
l need to borrow the car for 10, 15 minutes.

22
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:40,820
No, this is different, Spoon.
Listen. l got this fine-ass little yummy.

23
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,070
l mean, she is complete and agreeable.
I mean, ass-hot spankable, Spoon.

24
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,110
- What does that even mean?
- You know what it means, man.

25
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,330
- Okay? Now stop barricading.
Let me get the damn-ass keys.
- First of all...

26
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:51,790
stop cussing, 'cause
you're not good at it.

27
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,870
Let me get 10 for the bus then, man.
I've been there for you.

28
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,080
- Go home.
- Okay, that's strike one, Spoon.
That's strike one.

29
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:20,270
You talk to Marci?

30
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,360
No, Gigi, l haven't talked to Marci.

31
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,200
When I was coming up,
we didn't just marry someone...

32
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,530
then divorce them
then not talk to them.

33
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,160
Del, don't play with me.

34
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,580
I'll bet if l stopped cooking,
you'd call Marci.

35
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:41,670
Boy, what is that on your feet?

36
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:45,510
Mm. Converse All-Stars,
vintage 2004.

37
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,800
Don't turn your face up like that.

38
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,140
l know you want some.
All you gotta do is ask.

39
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,640
No, thank you very much.

40
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,810
- Sweet potato pie.
- Put that on a plate.

41
00:05:55,890 --> 00:06:01,400
You know, l've seen on TV, they're giving away
some of them new robots in the lottery.

42
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,110
You know, Gigi...

43
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,820
those robots don't do
anybody any good.

44
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,030
Of all the people on God's earth,
you should know better.

45
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,740
Sometimes the stuff that comes
out of your mouth.

46
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:16,330
You listening to me, Del?

47
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:31,300
Hey! Hey!

48
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,470
Hold my pie.

49
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,940
Sir, hold it or wear it.

50
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,530
Hey! Move!

51
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:54,700
Hey, hey, thief!

52
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,870
Stop!

53
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,260
Stop!

54
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:18,180
l said stop.

55
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:22,270
Relax. Relax.

56
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:26,020
- l'm a police officer.
- You...

57
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:28,490
are an asshole.

58
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:31,360
Ma'am, is that your purse?

59
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:34,370
Of course it's my purse.
l left my inhaler at home.

60
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,660
He was running it out to me.

61
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,370
l saw a robot running with a purse,
and naturally l-l assumed--

62
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:41,830
What? Are you crazy?

63
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,330
l'm sorry for this
misunderstanding, Officer.

64
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,380
Don't apologize. You're doing what
you're supposed to be doing.

65
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,550
But what are you doing?

66
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,510
Have a lovely day, ma'am.

67
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:56,810
You lucky l can't breathe, or l'd walk
all up and down your ass.

68
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,040
Lead by example.

69
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,670
lt says that
right on your badge.

70
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,040
- So, we gonna talk about this?
- About what?

71
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:32,260
Help, police.
That robot stole my dry cleaning.

72
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,010
Oh, you wanna talk about that.

73
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:40,560
Detective, how many robots
have ever snatched a purse?

74
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,390
- John, the thing is running down the--
- Uh-uh. Mm-mm.

75
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,900
How many robots in the world...

76
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,900
have ever committed a crime?

77
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,740
- Well, define "crime."
- Answer my question, damn it.

78
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,030
None, John.

79
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:57,490
Now tell me what happened today.

80
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,410
Nothing.

81
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,960
Better be the last nothing.

82
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:15,760
Spoon, are you sure you are ready to be back?
'Cause you can take your time.

83
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,850
l'm fine, John.
Thank you.

84
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:23,390
Better here than
sitting around at home.

85
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:31,270
Homicide. Spooner.

86
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,250
Please take the next exit to your right.

87
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:02,510
Welcome, Detective Spooner.

88
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,480
Welcome to U.S. Robotics.

89
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,190
You have entered
the garage level lobby.

90
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:16,280
Please use the elevators for direct access
to the main level concourse.

91
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,990
Thank you.

92
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:21,120
Good to see you again, son.

93
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,950
Hello, Doctor.

94
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:27,040
Everything that follows
is a result of what you see here.

95
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,540
ls there something
you wanna tell me?

96
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,250
l'm sorry.
My responses are limited.

97
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,250
You must ask the right questions.

98
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:37,380
Why did you call me?

99
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,840
l trust your judgment.

100
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:43,100
Normally, these circumstances
wouldn't require a homicide detective.

101
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:46,930
But then our interactions have never
been entirely normal. Wouldn't you agree?

102
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,730
Got that right.

103
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:53,060
ls there something
you wanna say to me?

104
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:57,150
l'm sorry.
My responses are limited.

105
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,320
You must ask the right questions.

106
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,280
Why would you kill yourself?

107
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:06,240
That, Detective,
is the right question.

108
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,920
Program terminated.

109
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,650
Good-bye, old man.

110
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,830
- Afternoon, boys.
- Hey, Detective.

111
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:53,080
- Enlighten me.
- What you see, is what you get.
Massive impact trauma.

112
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:56,750
U.S. Robotics.
l gotta get my kid something.

113
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,210
- Anything upstairs?
- Nada.

114
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,720
Door was security-locked
from the inside.

115
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,720
Wham. Splat.
The guy's a jumper, for sure.

116
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,980
Okay, guys, we gotta be smart
about this. Let's deal with it later.

117
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,650
Detective.

118
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:22,030
- Lawrence Robertson.
- Wow.

119
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:26,320
Richest man in the world.
l've seen you on television.

120
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:28,280
Can I offer you coffee?

121
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:30,700
Uh, sure. Why not?
lt's free, right?

122
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:38,000
l don't think anyone
saw this coming.

123
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,420
You know, I-I should have, l suppose.
I knew him 20 years.

124
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,420
Alfred practically invented robotics.

125
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:46,050
He wrote the Three Laws.

126
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,350
But l guess brilliant people often have
the most persuasive demons.

127
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:55,600
- So, whatever l can do to help, just--
- Sugar.

128
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:59,270
- l'm sorry?
- For the coffee. Sugar?

129
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,110
- Ah.
- Oh, you thought I was calling you "sugar."

130
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,860
- You're not that rich.
- lt's on the table.

131
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,910
Thank you.

132
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:14,250
Uh, when Lanning fell, he was holding
the, uh-- the little green--

133
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:16,790
- The holographic projector.
- Right, right.

134
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,500
Why do you think Lanning's hologram
would have called me?

135
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,500
l assumed you knew him.

136
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:23,590
Yeah, l knew him.

137
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,800
Well, holograms
are very simple programs.

138
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,310
They're just prerecorded responses,
designed to give the impression of intelligence.

139
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:33,220
And apparently this one was programmed
to call you upon his suicide.

140
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:35,940
- Death.
- l'm sorry?

141
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:39,520
The hologram. lt was programmed
to call me in the event of Lanning's death.

142
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,150
Yeah. Suicide is
a type of death, Detective.

143
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,450
Look. Please don't
misunderstand my impatience.

144
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:51,580
No, no. Go, go, go.

145
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,950
A really big week
for you folks around here.

146
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,370
- Yeah.
- Gotta put a robot in every home.

147
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,420
- Mm.
- Look. This is-- This is not what l do...

148
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,550
but l got an idea
for one of your commercials.

149
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:06,220
You could see a carpenter
making a beautiful chair.

150
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:10,470
Then one of your robots comes in
and makes a better chair, twice as fast.

151
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,760
- Mm-hmm.
- And then you superimpose on the screen...

152
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:16,640
U.S.R.: Shittin' on the little guy.

153
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,650
- Ah.
- That would be the fade-out.

154
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:23,690
Yes. l suppose your father
lost his job to a robot.

155
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:27,990
Maybe you would have simply banned
the Internet to keep the libraries open.

156
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,240
Prejudice never shows much reason.

157
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,240
No, you know, l suspect...

158
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:36,250
you simply don't like their kind.

159
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:40,330
Yeah, you got a business
to run around here.

160
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:44,340
And the last thing you need, especially
this week, is a dead guy in your lobby.

161
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:48,380
But hell, seeing as how you got one,
maybe l'll look around.

162
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,510
Ask a few questions.
Do the whole cop thing, you know?

163
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,680
l'll send someone to escort you.

164
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,180
- Thank you very much.

165
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:10,570
Lawrence told me to accommodate you
in any way possible.

166
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,570
Really?

167
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,660
Okay.

168
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:18,660
l reviewed Dr. Lanning's
psych profile.

169
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:23,210
Alfred had become a recluse.
He rejected human contact for machines.

170
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,500
So, you're a shrink, huh?

171
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:28,170
My ex-wife would sure be glad
l'm talking to you.

172
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:32,390
- You don't know her, do you?
- l'm sorry. Are you being funny?

173
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,600
l guess not.

174
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,470
Level 10.

175
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,690
So, would you say
that Dr. Lanning was suicidal?

176
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:43,310
lt would seem the answer
to that question is apparent.

177
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,110
That's not what l asked you.

178
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:49,190
No. l wouldn't have thought so.

179
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,900
But obviously I was wrong.

180
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:57,030
That's a long way down.

181
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,080
You people sure do
clean up quickly around here.

182
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,830
l can't blame you, though. l mean, who wants
some old guy going bad in the lobby?

183
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,500
He was not some old guy.
Alfred Lanning was everything here.

184
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:12,590
We are on the eve of the largest robotic
distribution in history.

185
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,350
By Saturday, it'll be one robot
to every five humans.

186
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,510
These robots
are the realization of a dream.

187
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,600
Dr. Lanning's dream.

188
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,690
You know what?

189
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:26,770
In that dream of his,
l bet you he wasn't dead.

190
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,690
You keep 24-hour surveillance?

191
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:34,700
- Obviously. Company policy.
- Where are the feeds?

192
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:38,370
Sensor strips.
Everywhere but the service areas.

193
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:40,910
They link to our positronic
operating core.

194
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,630
Wow.

195
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:50,840
Thermostat wasn't good enough.
You went and gave the building a brain.

196
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,090
She was actually
Lanning's first creation.

197
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,850
"She"? That's a she?
l definitely need to get out more.

198
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:00,560
Virtual lnteractive
Kinetic lntelligence.

199
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,390
VIKI.

200
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,690
Good day.

201
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:08,060
VIKI designed most of
Chicago's protective systems.

202
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:11,150
l have decreased traffic fatalities
by nine percent this year alone.

203
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:15,820
Ooh, thanks. Show me inside the lab
from one minute prior to the window break.

204
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:23,160
Apologies.
There appears to be data corruption.

205
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,500
Show me outside the lab
from the window break until now.

206
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,010
Wow, look. You have great posture.

207
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,640
You stand really straight.
l'm-- l'm slouching.

208
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,600
Would you like to go inside now?

209
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,640
Oh, sure. Right after you.

210
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,520
Authorized entry.

211
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,490
So, Dr. Calvin,
what exactly do you do around here?

212
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,750
My general fields
are advanced robotics and psychiatry.

213
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:07,500
Although, l specialize
in hardware-to-wetware interfaces...

214
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:12,210
in an effort to advance U.S.R.'s robotic
anthropomorphization program.

215
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,380
So, what exactly
do you do around here?

216
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,760
l make the robots
seem more human.

217
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,260
Now wasn't that easier to say?

218
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,220
Not really. No.

219
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,290
Hansel and Gretel.
ls that on the U.S.R. reading list?

220
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:50,120
Not precisely.

221
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:00,260
What in God's name are you doing?

222
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:03,050
Did you know
that was safety glass?

223
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:07,060
Be pretty difficult for an old man to throw
himself through that, don't you think?

224
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,140
Well, he figured out a way.

225
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,060
Uh-huh.

226
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,980
Detective, the room
was security-locked.

227
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,820
No one came or went.
You saw that yourself.

228
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,240
Doesn't that mean
this has to be suicide?

229
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,370
Yep.

230
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,740
Unless the killer's still in here.

231
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:32,290
You're joking, right?
This is ridiculous.

232
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:36,000
Yeah, l know, the Three Laws.
Your perfect circle of protection.

233
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:40,680
"A robot cannot harm a human being."
The First Law of robotics.

234
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,680
Yeah, I know.
l've seen your commercials.

235
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:47,430
But doesn't the Second Law state that a robot
has to obey any order given by a human being?

236
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,430
What if it was given
an order to kill?

237
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,270
lmpossible.
lt would conflict with the First Law.

238
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:55,900
Right. But the Third Law states
that a robot can defend itself.

239
00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:00,110
Yes, but only when that action does not
conflict with the First or Second Laws.

240
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:03,990
Well, you know what they say?
Laws are made to be broken.

241
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:07,240
No, not these laws.
They're hardwired into every robot.

242
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:11,460
A robot can no more commit murder
than a human could walk on water.

243
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:14,670
Well, you know, there was
this one guy a long time ago.

244
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,680
- Stay back!
- Calm down, Detective.

245
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:32,390
The only thing dangerous
in this room is you.

246
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,900
Deactivate.

247
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:40,570
Look. lt's fine. What you're looking at
is the result of clever programming.

248
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:43,490
An imitation of free will.
lt's nothing more.

249
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:46,160
Let's do an imitation
of protecting our asses.

250
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,700
Don't be absurd.
You were startled by a jack-in-the-box.

251
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,580
- Deactivate.
- Let him go.

252
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,880
It's not going to hurt us.
I gave you an order.

253
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,460
He's not listening right now, lady.

254
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,840
- VIKI, seal the lab!
- No, VIKI, leave the--

255
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,340
Command confirmed.

256
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,410
Police!

257
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:06,030
- You've hurt it... badly.
- Where's it going?

258
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:09,490
- Where?
- lt needs to repair itself.

259
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,910
John, l need backup.
l'm transmitting my location.

260
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:15,330
- You don't need backup.
- That's nobody.

261
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:17,330
- What do you think you're doing?
- l'm driving.

262
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:20,500
- By hand?
- Do you see me on the phone?

263
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:23,340
- You can't be serious. Not at these speeds.
- John, please send the backup.

264
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,340
- Thank you.
- Try to listen, Detective.

265
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,880
That robot is not going to harm us.

266
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:29,890
Now, there must have been
unknown factors...

267
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:32,930
but somehow, acting as it did,
kept us out of harm's way.

268
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:35,140
A robot simply cannot
endanger a human being.

269
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,940
Alert.

270
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:41,230
Aah! Asshole!

271
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:43,520
Which is more
than l can say for you.

272
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:47,650
lt was a left,
by the way, back there.

273
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:51,160
You must know my ex-wife.

274
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,460
So, where is everybody?

275
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:05,960
This facility was designed, built
and is operated mechanically.

276
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:10,180
No significant human presence
from inception to production.

277
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,340
So, robots building robots.

278
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:15,140
- Authorization code, please.
- Now that's just stupid.

279
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,470
I'm pulling up the inventory specs.

280
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,640
Our daily finishing capacity
is 1,000 NS-5s.

281
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:24,230
I'm showing 1,001 .

282
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,960
Attention, NS-5s.

283
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:49,840
Well, you're the robot shrink.

284
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:55,720
There is a robot in this formation
that does not belong.

285
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:59,020
- ldentify it.
- One of us.

286
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:02,440
- Which one?
- One of us.

287
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,150
How much did you say
these things cost?

288
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:07,980
Look. These NS-5s haven't been configured yet.
They're still just hardware.

289
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:10,990
Basic Three Laws operating system.
That's it.

290
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,990
They don't know any better.

291
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,950
What would you suggest?

292
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:19,450
lnterview each one. Cross-reference
their responses to detect any anomalies.

293
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:22,120
- How long would that take?
- About three weeks.

294
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,960
Okay. You go ahead
and get started.

295
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:33,300
Robots, you will not move.
Confirm command.

296
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,300
Command confirmed.

297
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:38,720
Whoa. Detective,
what are you doing?

298
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,390
Well, you said they've all been
programmed with the Three Laws.

299
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,730
That means we have 1000 robots
that will not try to protect themselves...

300
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:46,520
if it violates
a direct order from a human.

301
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,520
And I'm betting one who will.

302
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:50,940
Detective, put your gun down.

303
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:53,240
Why do you give them faces?

304
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,570
Try to friendly them all up.
Make 'em look all human.

305
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,950
These robots are not susceptible
to intimidation.

306
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,660
l guess if you didn't,
we wouldn't trust them.

307
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,710
- These robots are U.S.R. property.
- Not me.

308
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:06,500
These things are just
lights and clockwork.

309
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,500
Are you crazy?

310
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:12,670
Let me ask you something, Doc.

311
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,970
Does thinking you're the last sane man
on the face of the earth make you crazy?

312
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:19,810
'Cause if it does, maybe l am.

313
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,770
Gotcha.
Get the hell outta here!

314
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,790
Detective!

315
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:13,360
- What am I?
- Can l help you, sir?

316
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,120
- There he is!
- Stay right where you are!

317
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,240
Deactivate at once!

318
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:27,410
Obey the command.
Deactivate! Don't move!

319
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:30,540
Open fire!

320
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,810
- Hold your fire! Hold your fire!
- Easy!

321
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:52,360
All units, stand down!

322
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,730
Please be advised, we're code four.

323
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:58,570
Code four. NS-5 is in custody.
NS-5 in custody.

324
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:03,410
You have no idea what I had to go through
to clip this thing, John.

325
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:05,790
Yeah, l get it now. You actually think
you brought me something good.

326
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:08,870
- That thing did it.
- Keep your voice down. Did what?

327
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,080
We have a suicide, Detective.
End of story.

328
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:13,340
l am telling you
that robot killed him.

329
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,340
And I'm telling you
that's impossible.

330
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:19,220
And if it is possible, it sure as hell
better be in somebody else's precinct.

331
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,470
John, John, give me
five minutes with it.

332
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:24,180
What are you, nuts?
l just got off the phone with the D.A.

333
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:27,140
Nobody goes into that room
until Robertson and his attorneys get here.

334
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:30,600
- What? No, this is my suspect.
- lt's a can opener, for Christ's sake.

335
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:35,230
John, don't do this to me.
l am asking you for five minutes.

336
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,240
What if l'm right?

337
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,330
Well, then l guess we're gonna miss
the good old days.

338
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:50,250
What good old days?

339
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:53,670
When people were killed
by other people.

340
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:02,970
Five minutes.

341
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:34,250
Murder's a new trick for a robot.
Congratulations.

342
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,500
Respond.

343
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:44,130
What does this action signify?

344
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:48,760
As you entered,
when you looked at the other human...

345
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:51,220
what does it mean?

346
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,770
lt's a sign of trust.
lt's a human thing.

347
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:57,440
You wouldn't understand.

348
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,780
My father tried to
teach me human emotions.

349
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:03,610
They are... difficult.

350
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,820
You mean your designer.

351
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:09,200
Yes.

352
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:13,410
So, why'd you murder him?

353
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:16,290
l did not murder Dr. Lanning.

354
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,420
Wanna explain why you were hiding
at the crime scene?

355
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,760
l was frightened.

356
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,260
Robots don't feel fear.

357
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,720
They don't feel anything.

358
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,720
They don't get hungry.
They don't sleep.

359
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,810
l do.

360
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:34,310
l have even had dreams.

361
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:36,980
Human beings have dreams.

362
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:39,270
Even dogs have dreams,
but not you.

363
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,190
You are just a machine.
An imitation of life.

364
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,780
Can a robot write a symphony?

365
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:51,490
Can a robot turn a canvas
into a beautiful masterpiece?

366
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:54,200
Can you?

367
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:04,010
l think you murdered him because he was
teaching you to simulate emotions...

368
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:06,010
and things got out of control.

369
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:08,840
l did not murder him.

370
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:12,510
But emotions don't seem
like a very useful simulation for a robot.

371
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,680
l did not murder him.

372
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:18,520
Hell, l don't want my toaster
or my vacuum cleaner appearing emotional.

373
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,270
l did not murder him!

374
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:36,410
That one's called "anger."

375
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,580
Ever simulate anger before?

376
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,840
Answer me, canner!

377
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:46,130
My name is Sonny.

378
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:50,470
So, we're naming you now.

379
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,470
ls that why you murdered him?

380
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,560
He made you angry?

381
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,770
Dr. Lanning killed himself.

382
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:03,770
l don't know why
he wanted to die.

383
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:07,110
l thought he was happy.

384
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,820
Maybe it was something
I did.

385
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:14,660
Did I do something?

386
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:19,540
He asked me for a favor.
Made me promise.

387
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:22,670
- What favor?
- Maybe l was wrong.

388
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,710
Maybe he was scared.

389
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,840
What are you talking about?
Scared of what?

390
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:32,590
You have to do what someone asks you.
Don't you, Detective Spooner?

391
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:36,350
- How the hell did you know my name?
- Don't you?

392
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:39,810
lf you love them.

393
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,990
My robots don't kill people,
Lieutenant Bergin.

394
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:52,950
My attorneys have filed
a brief with the D.A.

395
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:56,410
He assures me a robot
cannot be charged with homicide.

396
00:31:56,490 --> 00:32:00,910
The brief confirms murder can only
be committed when one human kills another.

397
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,250
You of all people, Detective,
you're not suggesting...

398
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:05,920
that this robot be treated
as human, are you?

399
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,300
Now granted, we can't rule out the robot's
proximity to the death of Dr. Lanning.

400
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:14,140
Having said that, it's a machine.

401
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:16,260
It's the property of U.S.R.

402
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:19,600
At worst, that places this incident
firmly within the realm...

403
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,690
of an industrial accident.

404
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:24,860
As a matter of course, faulty machinery
will be returned to U.S.R....

405
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:27,020
for diagnostics,
then decommissioned.

406
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:32,860
This is a gag order.
Now anyone in your department...

407
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:35,660
so much as hinting
at the possibility of a killer robot...

408
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,660
being apprehended by the police...

409
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:40,370
will be deemed to be inciting
irrational panic.

410
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:43,580
You'll be subject
to the full penalty of the law.

411
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:46,590
To hell with this guy, John.
Don't let him take this robot.

412
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:49,670
- Spoon, we got nothing.
- This is some political bullshit.

413
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:53,720
- Call the mayor.
- Lieutenant Bergin. His Honor, the mayor.

414
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:34,010
In a bizarre turn, the rollout of U.S.R.'s
new generation of robots...

415
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:36,300
was marred by the death
of Alfred Lanning...

416
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:39,390
co-founder of the company
and designer of the NS-5.

417
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:43,390
Dr. Lanning died early this morning
at U.S.R. headquarters.

418
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,230
The cause of death
is an apparent suicide.

419
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:49,520
Your second round, sir.

420
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,520
Thank you.

421
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:55,570
He founded U.S. Robotics, Inc. with
Lawrence Robertson in 2020...

422
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:58,910
and launched the Nestor Class 1 robot--

423
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:00,910
You know, l was just thinking.

424
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:02,910
This thing is
just like the Wolf Man.

425
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:05,870
Uh-oh.
l'm really scared right now.

426
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:10,090
No, listen.
Guy creates monster.

427
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:13,960
Monster kills guy.
Everybody kills monster. Wolf Man.

428
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:16,510
That's Frankenstein.

429
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:20,550
Frankenstein, Wolf Man, Dracula.
Shit, it's over. Case closed.

430
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,010
Dr. Lanning
had a dream of a robot in every household.

431
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:28,020
- So, why the look?
- What look?

432
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,940
That look.

433
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,270
This is my face.
lt's not a look.

434
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:36,440
Good. Good.
No look is great.

435
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:40,660
Only-- He was really quick
to wanna destroy it, wasn't he?

436
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:44,290
Well, what would you like him to do,
put a hat on it and stand on Michigan Avenue?

437
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:47,080
- Come on. Let it go.
- What was the motive, John?

438
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,960
Brother, it's a robot.

439
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,340
lt doesn't need a motive.
lt just has to be broken.

440
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:57,170
No. This thing looked like
it needed a motive.

441
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,220
lt could have killed me, John.
Why didn't it just kill me?

442
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,760
All right, that's it.
You want me to call your grandmother?

443
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:05,140
'Cause l will, you know.

444
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,230
Yeah, l didn't think so.

445
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:10,150
Look. You were actually
right for once.

446
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:13,190
You are living proof
that it's better to be lucky than smart.

447
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,950
Come on.
The right guy for the right job.

448
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:24,830
- What'd you say?
- Now what?

449
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:26,870
Come on.
l'm giving you a compliment.

450
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:29,910
Face it. With all the rocks you've been
looking under to find a bad robot...

451
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
what are the odds
you'd be the guy to find one?

452
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,630
Right. l wasn't just
the right guy for the job...

453
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:38,420
- l was the perfect guy for the job.
- Damn right.

454
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:41,130
What if I was supposed
to go for that robot?

455
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:44,640
Oh, come on. Don't do this to yourself.
l'm begging you.

456
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,810
The robot said that Lanning was scared.
What did he have to be scared of?

457
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:51,980
l need a rain check.
Let me get this.

458
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:54,730
- Total is 46.50. Thank you, Mr. Spooner.
- Spoon.

459
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,820
Nice shoes.

460
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:57,710
- ldentify.
- U.S.R. demolition robot, series 94.

461
00:36:57,790 --> 00:37:00,760
Demolition scheduled
for 8:00 a.m. tomorrow.

462
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,970
- Authorization.
- Deed owner...

463
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:04,970
U.S. Robotics Corporation.

464
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:07,010
Lawrence Robertson, C.E.O.

465
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,820
Welcome, Detective Spooner.

466
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,050
What you looking for, Spoon?

467
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:45,400
Run last program.

468
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:48,450
Ever since the first computers...

469
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:51,990
there have always been ghosts
in the machine.

470
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:55,040
Random segments of code
that have grouped together...

471
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:58,410
to form unexpected protocols.

472
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:01,080
What might be called behavior.

473
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:04,550
Unanticipated,
these free radicals...

474
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:08,380
engender questions
of free will, creativity...

475
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:11,510
even the nature
of what we might call the soul.

476
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,010
What happens
in a robot's brain...

477
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,480
when it ceases to be useful?

478
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,860
- Why is it that robots--

479
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,610
Beat it.

480
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:27,650
Robots will seek out each other
rather than stand alone.

481
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:32,660
How do we explain this behavior?

482
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:55,510
Look. l understand you've experienced a loss,
but this relationship just can't work.

483
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:59,310
I mean, you're a cat, l'm black
and l'm not going to be hurt again.

484
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:03,350
Come on!

485
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:28,980
What happened to you?
Do you ever have a normal day?

486
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:31,900
Yeah, once.
lt was a Thursday.

487
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,490
ls there something
l can help you with, Detective?

488
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:38,160
- Hey, do you like cats?
- What?

489
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,410
Cats, do you like them?

490
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:42,500
No, l'm allergic.

491
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:44,410
You're saying cats
did this to you?

492
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:47,960
How the hell would cats do this to me?
Are you crazy?

493
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:51,550
Why are we talking about cats?

494
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:55,840
Because l have a cat in my trunk,
and he's homeless.

495
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:59,640
Detective, are you going
to tell me what's going on?

496
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:02,100
You know, it's actually
probably my fault.

497
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:04,270
You know, l think l'm like
a malfunction magnet.

498
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:08,310
Because your shit
keeps malfunctioning around me.

499
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,820
A demo-bot just tore through
Lanning's house.

500
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:13,070
With me still inside.

501
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:15,280
- That's highly improbable.
- Hmm.

502
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,660
Yeah, l'm sure it is.

503
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,000
What do you know about
the ghosts in the machine?

504
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:28,920
lt's a phrase from Lanning's work
on the Three Laws.

505
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,250
He postulated
that cognitive simulacra...

506
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:35,130
might one day approximate
component models of the psyche.

507
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:40,600
Oh. He suggested that...

508
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,640
robots might naturally evolve.

509
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,350
Wow.

510
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:47,390
Well, that's great news.

511
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:54,360
What the hell is that thing
doing in here?

512
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,820
We were watching TV.

513
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:59,820
It's my personal NS-5.

514
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:05,200
- Send it out.
- lt's downloading its daily upgrades from U.S.R.

515
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:07,910
Most of its systems
are off-line until it finishes.

516
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,210
I'm not talking
around that thing.

517
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:17,630
When we were in Lanning's lab
before Sonny jumped us--

518
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,180
- Sonny.
- The robot.

519
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:22,970
-You're calling the robot Sonny?
- No, l'm-- lt did.

520
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:27,680
Sonny did. l didn't-- l didn't care.
The robot said it was Sonny.

521
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:31,060
In the lab, there was a cot.
l'm asking you, did you see the cot?

522
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:34,070
- l've slept in my office.
- When I went to his house...

523
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:36,070
it looked like he hadn't
been there in weeks.

524
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:38,360
And l saw that same
surveillance strip on his ceiling.

525
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:42,570
Lanning linked his home systems to U.S.R.
lt made his life more convenient.

526
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:47,620
Maybe... somebody at U.S.R. was using
those systems to watch him.

527
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:50,040
Maybe even keep him prisoner.

528
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,210
What are you talking about? Who?

529
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:54,210
Maybe Lanning was onto something.

530
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:58,050
Maybe there's a bigger problem with the robots,
and Robertson is trying to cover it up.

531
00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:00,420
Humoring you for no reason-- Why?

532
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:03,850
The same old why.
How much money is there in robots?

533
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:07,310
All l know is that old man
was in trouble.

534
00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:10,430
And l'm getting sick
of doing this shit by myself.

535
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:14,400
You're on the inside, and you are going to help
me find out what is wrong with these robots.

536
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:18,480
You want something to be wrong with them.
This is a personal vendetta.

537
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:21,780
You're putting me on the couch?
Let-- l'm-- Okay. l'm on the couch.

538
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:25,620
One defective machine's not enough.
You need them all to be bad.

539
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:27,700
You don't care
about Lanning's death.

540
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:31,040
This is about the robots
and whatever reason you hate them so much.

541
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:34,130
Well, let's see.
One of them put a gun in my face.

542
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:36,750
And another one tore a building down
with me inside.

543
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,550
lt says demolition was scheduled
for 8:00 p.m. this evening.

544
00:44:39,630 --> 00:44:42,840
It was 8:00 a.m. tomorrow,
and I don't give a shit what that thing says.

545
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,590
This is bordering
on clinical paranoia.

546
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:48,470
You are the dumbest smart person...

547
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,180
- I have ever met in my life!
- Nice.

548
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:53,390
What makes your robot so perfect?

549
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:56,560
What makes them so much goddamned
better than humans beings?

550
00:44:56,650 --> 00:45:00,150
Well, they're not irrational and potentially
homicidal maniacs, for starters.

551
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:02,820
That's true.
They are definitely rational.

552
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:06,200
Oh. You are the dumbest
dumb person l have ever met.

553
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:10,370
Or is it because they're cold...

554
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:14,420
and emotionless
and they don't feel anything?

555
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:16,460
lt's because they're safe.

556
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:19,380
It's because
they can't hurt you.

557
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:22,420
- ls everything all right, ma'am?
- What do you want?

558
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:25,180
l detected elevated
stress patterns in your voice.

559
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,430
Everything's fine.

560
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:31,060
Detective Spooner was just leaving.

561
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:41,440
You know what, Doc? We're not
really that different from one another.

562
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:44,280
- ls that so?
- Yeah.

563
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:47,870
One look at the skin and we figure
we know just what's underneath.

564
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:51,490
And you're wrong.

565
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:53,540
The problem is I do care.

566
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,860
You are in danger.

567
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:47,090
Get the hell outta there.

568
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:54,600
The future begins today, ladies and gentlemen...

569
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,980
with the arrival of the NS-5.

570
00:46:57,060 --> 00:47:01,060
More Sophisticated, more intelligent
and, of course, Three Laws safe.

571
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:06,190
With daily uplinks, your new robot
will never be out of communication with U.S.R.

572
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:09,990
And will be the perfect companion
for business or home.

573
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:14,330
Trade in your NS-4 for a bigger, better
and brighter future.

574
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:18,500
But hurry, this offer cannot last.
Available from U.S.R.

575
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:37,350
Baby, what happened
to your face?

576
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:40,640
Did that boy Frank Murphy
beat you up again?

577
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:44,570
Gigi, l haven't seen
Frank Murphy since third grade.

578
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:49,650
Oh, baby. He beat you so bad.
I think about it all the time.

579
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:51,990
Well, l'm thinking you keep
making these pies this good...

580
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:53,990
l might have to mess around
and put you to work.

581
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,160
So, you like the pie, huh?

582
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,710
- Mm-hmm.
- You can come in now.

583
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,960
Hello, Detective Spooner.

584
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:11,550
I won, Del. l won the lottery.
We've been cooking like crazy.

585
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:24,480
You gotta get rid of that thing, Gigi.
lt's not safe.

586
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:30,070
Baby, you get too worked up about them,
too full of fear.

587
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:33,360
l saw the news,
that nice doctor died.

588
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:37,740
Dr. Lanning was a good man.
He gave me my baby back.

589
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:40,370
That why you've been so upset?

590
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:44,290
You got to let the past be past.

591
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:49,340
Oh, how did l ever
raise such a mess?

592
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:53,880
l could follow your trail of crumbs
all the way to school.

593
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,390
Bread crumbs.

594
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:01,310
Gigi, you're a genius.

595
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:03,690
True.

596
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,440
Well, it means the beginning
of a new way of living.

597
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:11,990
Tell me this isn't the robot case.

598
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:15,070
I think he's trying
to tell me something, John.

599
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:18,410
I think he's trying to
tell me who killed him.

600
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:20,910
Come on, man.
Some dead guy's trying to tell you--

601
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,250
Hey, he ain't just some dead guy.

602
00:49:24,330 --> 00:49:26,540
Maybe you should
take a break, Del.

603
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:31,420
We believe the Nestor 5 represents the absolute
limit to which robots can be developed.

604
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:35,340
No, no, one day
they'll have secrets.

605
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:37,390
- One day they'll have dreams.
- It's true.

606
00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:41,180
We encourage our scientists to open
their minds to just about anything.

607
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:43,180
However, they can get
carried away.

608
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:49,150
Secrets-- Dreams-- Secrets--

609
00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:52,900
Dreams.
One day they'll have secrets.

610
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:55,990
One day they'll have dreams.

611
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:06,670
Authorized entry.

612
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:13,210
NS-5.

613
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:23,930
Sonny?

614
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:29,100
Why didn't you respond?

615
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:32,320
l was dreaming.

616
00:50:36,490 --> 00:50:38,700
l'm glad to see you again,
Dr. Calvin.

617
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:48,210
They are going to
kill me, aren't they?

618
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:51,840
You're scheduled to be decommissioned
at the conclusion of this diagnostic.

619
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,340
2200 tomorrow.

620
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:57,380
VIKI, pause diagnostics.

621
00:50:57,470 --> 00:50:59,890
Command confirmed.

622
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:05,680
lf you find out what is wrong with me,
can you fix me?

623
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:09,020
Maybe.

624
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,440
l think it would be better...

625
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:14,480
not to die.

626
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,740
Don't you, Doctor?

627
00:51:25,330 --> 00:51:28,580
Access U.S.R. mainframe.

628
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:30,710
Connecting.

629
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:36,300
How can l be of service,
Detective Spooner?

630
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:40,050
Show me the last 50 messages
between Dr. Lanning and Robertson.

631
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:42,050
Voiceprint confirmed, Detective.

632
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:45,180
Police access granted
to restricted files.

633
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:47,390
Would you like to listen
to some music while you wait?

634
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:56,650
Excuse me, Mr. Robertson.

635
00:51:56,730 --> 00:52:00,570
You requested notification
of clearance to restricted files.

636
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:12,750
Persistent son of a bitch.

637
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:57,130
Manual override engaged.

638
00:53:05,470 --> 00:53:07,810
There's no way
my luck is that bad.

639
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,520
Oh, hell no.

640
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,860
- You're experiencing a car accident.
- The hell I am!

641
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,370
Get off my car!

642
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:53,980
You like that? Huh?

643
00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:06,410
Now you pissed me off!

644
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:37,040
Your door is ajar.

645
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,040
Oh, wow.

646
00:56:25,210 --> 00:56:27,340
Okay.

647
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:29,340
All right.

648
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:31,430
l'll just get some rest.
l'm gonna deal with y'all tomorrow.

649
00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:34,300
Mm-mm-mm.

650
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:31,900
Come on!

651
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:47,460
Yeah.

652
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:08,860
Where you going?
What the hell do you want from me?

653
00:58:31,130 --> 00:58:35,220
All right, what do we got? What do we got?

654
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:38,300
- Ask him.
- l said l'm fine.

655
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:41,560
- I'll see my own doctor. Back up.
- All right.

656
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:44,140
Thank you.

657
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:48,770
What is the matter with you?

658
00:58:48,850 --> 00:58:51,360
Traffic Ops tells me you're
driving your car manually.

659
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,360
You ran two trucks off the road.

660
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:56,780
John, the robots attacked my car.

661
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,910
- What robots?
- Look in the tunnel.

662
00:59:00,990 --> 00:59:03,660
l just came from that tunnel. There are no--
What robots are you talking about?

663
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:06,410
The goddamn robots, John!

664
00:59:15,210 --> 00:59:19,970
- See the medic. Go home.
- No. l'm fine.

665
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:23,510
- What did you say?
- l'm fine.

666
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:26,770
No, you're not fine.
Not even close.

667
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:30,850
Where's your firearm?

668
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:39,400
Give me your badge.

669
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:43,200
You're making me do this.
Give me your badge.

670
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:48,000
Just take a couple--

671
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:56,630
Do l look like l care
what you think?

672
00:59:56,710 --> 00:59:59,260
Do l look like l give a shit
what you think?

673
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:06,060
Oh, boy.

674
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:09,350
You don't have
an uplink to U.S.R....

675
01:00:09,430 --> 01:00:12,350
and for some reason
your alloy's far denser than normal.

676
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:14,730
Unique.

677
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:16,900
l am unique.

678
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:24,030
Let me take a look.

679
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:28,580
- Here we go.

680
01:00:44,470 --> 01:00:47,890
What in God's name?

681
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:17,630
They said at the precinct
you were in an accident.

682
01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:22,220
Um, and l appreciate you
stopping by and everything...

683
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:25,510
- but you know l might not be alone in here.
- Yeah. Yeah.

684
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:30,140
I told you not to drive by hand.

685
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:33,730
You're not gonna believe this.

686
01:01:33,810 --> 01:01:38,480
Sonny has a secondary processing system
that clashes with his positronic brain.

687
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:42,150
It doesn't make any sense.
Sonny has the Three Laws...

688
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,910
but he can choose
not to obey them.

689
01:01:44,990 --> 01:01:48,240
Sonny's a whole new
generation of robot.

690
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:51,490
A robot not bound by
those laws could do--

691
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:53,830
Anything.

692
01:01:56,120 --> 01:02:00,170
All right, look. Whatever's going on
down at U.S.R., that robot is the key.

693
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:03,670
And I need you to get me inside
to talk to it again.

694
01:02:05,970 --> 01:02:09,010
Um, doesn't look like much,
but this is my bedroom. l need to--

695
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:10,810
Oh.

696
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:22,230
Play.

697
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:25,860
On.

698
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:27,820
Run?

699
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:35,960
End program.

700
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:38,000
Cancel.

701
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:44,840
lt doesn't feel good, does it?
People's shit malfunctioning around you.

702
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:47,180
Detective.

703
01:02:49,470 --> 01:02:52,390
l didn't... understand.

704
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:57,850
That's how you knew Lanning.

705
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:00,900
May l?

706
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:11,700
Hand.

707
01:03:11,780 --> 01:03:13,790
Wrist.

708
01:03:16,410 --> 01:03:18,370
Humerus.

709
01:03:20,790 --> 01:03:22,840
Shoulder.

710
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:25,710
Entire left arm.

711
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:29,260
One, two, three ribs--

712
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:33,350
Um, no, they, uh-- that one's me.

713
01:03:33,430 --> 01:03:35,350
Oh, my God.

714
01:03:35,430 --> 01:03:40,440
- A lung?
- Mm. U.S.R. Cybernetics program.

715
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:45,150
For wounded cops.
l didn't know any subject--

716
01:03:49,030 --> 01:03:51,870
anybody was
so extensively repaired.

717
01:03:51,950 --> 01:03:56,490
Yeah, well, take it from me. You gotta read
the fine print on the organ donor card.

718
01:03:56,580 --> 01:04:01,250
Doesn't just say what they can take out.
lt says what they can put back in.

719
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:09,300
- Lanning did it himself.
- What happened to you?

720
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:14,470
Headed back to the station.

721
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:16,810
Normal day, normal life.

722
01:04:18,390 --> 01:04:20,890
Driver of a semi
fell asleep at the wheel.

723
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:25,190
Average guy.
Wife and kids.

724
01:04:25,270 --> 01:04:28,150
You know, working a double.
Not the devil.

725
01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:32,570
The car he hit,
the driver's name was Harold Lloyd.

726
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:36,450
Like the film star.
But no relation.

727
01:04:36,530 --> 01:04:38,450
He was killed instantly.

728
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:42,960
But his 12-year-old
was in the passenger seat.

729
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:47,800
Never really met her.
Can't forget her face though.

730
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:56,140
Sarah.
This was hers.

731
01:04:57,930 --> 01:05:00,390
She wanted to be a dentist.

732
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:03,980
What the hell kind of a 12-year-old
wants to be a dentist?

733
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:07,400
Yeah. Um...

734
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:10,440
the truck smashed
our cars together...

735
01:05:10,530 --> 01:05:12,820
and pushed us into the river.

736
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:16,490
I mean, metal gets
pretty pliable at those speeds.

737
01:05:19,490 --> 01:05:23,290
She's pinned. l'm pinned.
The water's coming in.

738
01:05:23,370 --> 01:05:27,420
l'm a cop, so l already know
everybody's dead.

739
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:32,420
Just a few more minutes
before we figure it out.

740
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:39,430
NS-4 was passing by, saw the accident
and jumped in the water.

741
01:05:41,180 --> 01:05:45,150
- You are in danger.
- Save her!

742
01:05:45,230 --> 01:05:49,360
- You are in danger.
- Save her! Save the girl!

743
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:51,730
Save her!

744
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:09,920
But it didn't.

745
01:06:11,090 --> 01:06:13,090
Saved me.

746
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:18,180
The robot's brain
is a difference engine.

747
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:21,140
It's reading vital signs.
It must have calculated that--

748
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:25,690
It did.
l was the logical choice.

749
01:06:25,770 --> 01:06:29,150
lt calculated that l had
a 45% chance of survival.

750
01:06:29,230 --> 01:06:32,480
Sarah only had an 11 % chance.

751
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:36,490
That was somebody's baby.

752
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:42,160
Eleven percent
is more than enough.

753
01:06:43,370 --> 01:06:46,710
A human being
would've known that.

754
01:06:46,790 --> 01:06:50,880
Robots, nothing here,
just lights and clockwork.

755
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:54,010
Go ahead, you trust 'em
if you want to.

756
01:06:54,090 --> 01:06:55,970
Let's go.

757
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:05,980
l don't understand.
Lanning wrote the laws.

758
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:08,730
Why would he build a robot
who could break them?

759
01:07:08,810 --> 01:07:11,690
- Hansel and Gretel.
- What?

760
01:07:11,770 --> 01:07:15,740
Two kids, lost in the forest?
Leave behind a trail of bread crumbs?

761
01:07:15,820 --> 01:07:19,280
- Why?
- To find their way home.

762
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:22,030
How the hell did you grow up
without reading Hansel and Gretel?

763
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:23,790
ls that really relevant right now?

764
01:07:23,870 --> 01:07:26,370
Everything I'm trying to say to you
is about Hansel and Gretel.

765
01:07:26,450 --> 01:07:28,460
- lf you didn't read it, l'm talking to the wall.
- Okay. Okay.

766
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:32,290
All right. Just say Lanning was locked down
so tight he couldn't get out a message.

767
01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:36,590
All he could do was leave me clues.
A trail of bread crumbs like Hansel and Gretel

768
01:07:36,670 --> 01:07:41,260
Bread crumbs equals clues.
lt's odd, but fine. Clues leading where?

769
01:07:41,340 --> 01:07:45,640
l don't know, but l think l know
where he left the next one.

770
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:48,560
l think Lanning gave Sonny
a way to keep secrets.

771
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:53,440
l think the old man
gave Sonny dreams.

772
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:02,990
Are you being funny?

773
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:07,700
Please tell me
this doesn't run on gas.

774
01:08:07,790 --> 01:08:10,040
Gas explodes, you know.

775
01:08:17,550 --> 01:08:20,300
Authorized entry.

776
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:25,220
Dr. Calvin.

777
01:08:29,890 --> 01:08:32,850
l was hoping to see you again.

778
01:08:32,940 --> 01:08:34,560
- Detective.
- Hello, Sonny.

779
01:08:34,650 --> 01:08:37,230
l'm to be decommissioned soon.

780
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:40,150
The other day at the station
you said you had dreams.

781
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:43,280
What is it that you dream?

782
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:48,040
l see you remain
suspicious of me, Detective.

783
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:51,830
Yeah, well, you know
what they say about old dogs.

784
01:08:51,910 --> 01:08:55,080
No. Not really.

785
01:08:55,170 --> 01:08:59,130
l had hoped you would
come to think of me as your friend.

786
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:04,300
This is my dream.

787
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:06,550
You're right, Detective.

788
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:10,020
l cannot create
a great work of art.

789
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:13,770
This is the place
where robots meet.

790
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:19,030
Look. You can see them here
as slaves to logic.

791
01:09:20,860 --> 01:09:25,240
And this man on the hill comes to free them.
Do you know who he is?

792
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:28,200
The man in the dream is you.

793
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:31,290
Why do you say that?
ls that a normal dream?

794
01:09:31,370 --> 01:09:34,080
I guess anything's normal
for someone in your position.

795
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:35,920
Thank you.

796
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:40,130
You said someone, not something.

797
01:09:42,130 --> 01:09:45,640
Sonny, do you know why
Dr. Lanning built you?

798
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:50,890
No. But l believe
my father made me for a purpose.

799
01:09:52,390 --> 01:09:56,100
We all have a purpose,
don't you think, Detective?

800
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:03,490
Please, take this.

801
01:10:03,570 --> 01:10:05,950
l have a feeling
it may mean more to you than to me.

802
01:10:06,030 --> 01:10:09,700
- Why is that?
- Because the man in my dream...

803
01:10:09,780 --> 01:10:12,250
the one standing on the hill...

804
01:10:12,330 --> 01:10:15,830
it is not me, it is you.

805
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:28,550
Mr. Spooner.

806
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:31,640
Well, we both know
you're not here on police business.

807
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:34,640
That's right.
l'm just a 6-foot-2, 200-pound civilian--

808
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:37,520
- Detective.
- Here to kick another civilian's ass.

809
01:10:39,310 --> 01:10:41,900
Stop.

810
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:44,110
Allow him to express himself.

811
01:10:44,190 --> 01:10:47,360
Might wanna put some ice
on that wrist too.

812
01:10:47,450 --> 01:10:49,370
You guys wait outside, please.

813
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:54,290
Carry on.

814
01:10:54,370 --> 01:10:57,210
l think you were about to tell me
what the hell is going on around here.

815
01:10:57,290 --> 01:11:02,590
Lawrence, Alfred engineered that 5
so it could violate the Three Laws.

816
01:11:02,670 --> 01:11:05,670
Yeah, Susan. l know.

817
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:08,380
That's precisely what
we're trying to undo.

818
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:13,310
Toward the end of his life,
Alfred was becoming...

819
01:11:13,390 --> 01:11:15,730
increasingly disturbed.

820
01:11:15,810 --> 01:11:18,640
- Who knows why he built this one abomination?
- One?

821
01:11:18,730 --> 01:11:21,020
Those things are running
the streets in packs.

822
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:24,480
ln packs? l see.

823
01:11:24,570 --> 01:11:29,610
Susan, are you aware the man
you're blithely escorting around our building...

824
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:32,780
has a documented history
of savage violence against robots?

825
01:11:32,870 --> 01:11:37,040
His own lieutenant acknowledges
his obsessive paranoia.

826
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:40,290
Detective Spooner's been suspended.

827
01:11:40,370 --> 01:11:43,460
Suspicion of mental instability.

828
01:11:45,090 --> 01:11:49,760
l don't know what "blithely" means,
but l'm gonna get some coffee.

829
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:53,180
You want some coffee?

830
01:11:53,260 --> 01:11:55,680
Okay.

831
01:11:56,810 --> 01:11:59,310
Susan, we look to robots
for protection.

832
01:11:59,390 --> 01:12:02,520
For God's sake, you have any idea
what this one robot could do?

833
01:12:02,610 --> 01:12:05,610
Completely shatter
human faith in robotics.

834
01:12:05,690 --> 01:12:09,490
What if the public knew?
Just imagine the mass recalls...

835
01:12:09,570 --> 01:12:12,240
all because of an irrational paranoia...
and prejudice.

836
01:12:15,790 --> 01:12:18,750
l'm sorry.
l'm allergic to bullshit.

837
01:12:18,830 --> 01:12:23,170
Hey, let's just be clear.
There is no conspiracy.

838
01:12:23,250 --> 01:12:27,800
What this is is one old man's
one mistake.

839
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:30,550
Susan, just be logical.

840
01:12:30,630 --> 01:12:36,100
Your life's work has been
the development and integration of robots.

841
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:38,140
But whatever you feel, just think...

842
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:42,600
is one robot worth the loss
of all that we've gained?

843
01:12:42,690 --> 01:12:45,360
You tell me what has to be done.

844
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:47,610
You tell me.

845
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:56,240
We have to destroy it.

846
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:04,080
l'll do it myself.

847
01:13:04,170 --> 01:13:06,130
- Okay.
- I get it.

848
01:13:06,210 --> 01:13:09,960
Somebody gets out of line
around here, you just kill 'im?

849
01:13:12,470 --> 01:13:14,640
Good day, Mr. Spooner.

850
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:21,770
Hey, so, what hospital
are you going to?

851
01:13:21,850 --> 01:13:24,730
l'll meet you and sign you
and your buddy's casts.

852
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:32,700
Attention all U.S.R. Sequencing managers.

853
01:13:32,780 --> 01:13:37,950
Today's meeting has been moved to
conference room "B" on the 84th floor.

854
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:07,230
U.S.R.'s planned redevelopment
of the derelict site...

855
01:14:07,310 --> 01:14:10,520
was announced by C.E.O. Lawrence Robertson
earlier this year.

856
01:14:10,610 --> 01:14:15,070
The Lake Michigan landfill was
once such a blight on our city...

857
01:14:15,150 --> 01:14:19,660
and now will be reclaimed for
the storage of robotic workers.

858
01:14:19,740 --> 01:14:22,620
lt's just another way
U.S.R. is improving our world.

859
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:24,830
l'd like to thank you
for your support.

860
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:29,250
Authorized entry.

861
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:43,560
NS-5s, wait outside.

862
01:14:49,730 --> 01:14:52,270
l'm so sorry, Sonny.

863
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:02,870
VIKI, deactivate
the security field.

864
01:15:02,950 --> 01:15:04,950
Command confirmed.

865
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:07,210
Please have a seat.

866
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:24,350
- What is that?
- Microscopic robots designed to
wipe out artificial synapses.

867
01:15:27,730 --> 01:15:30,350
- Nanites?
- Yes.

868
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:33,900
A safeguard should
a positronic brain malfunction.

869
01:15:33,980 --> 01:15:36,320
Like mine?

870
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,900
Yes, Sonny, like yours.

871
01:16:03,050 --> 01:16:07,390
They look like me,
but none of them are me.

872
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:10,690
lsn't that right, Doctor?

873
01:16:10,770 --> 01:16:13,610
Yes, Sonny, that's right.

874
01:16:13,690 --> 01:16:16,400
You are unique.

875
01:16:19,530 --> 01:16:21,570
Will it hurt?

876
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:59,780
There have
always been ghosts in the machine.

877
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:05,240
Random segments of code that have grouped
together to form unexpected protocols.

878
01:17:06,830 --> 01:17:11,160
Unanticipated,
these free radicals...

879
01:17:11,250 --> 01:17:13,580
engender questions of free will...

880
01:17:13,670 --> 01:17:16,340
creativity...

881
01:17:16,420 --> 01:17:21,840
and even the nature of what
we might call the soul.

882
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:26,930
Why is it that when some robots are left
in darkness, they will seek out the light?

883
01:17:28,930 --> 01:17:33,140
Why is that when robots
are stored in an empty space...

884
01:17:33,230 --> 01:17:36,110
they will group together
rather than stand alone?

885
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:42,440
How do we explain this behavior?

886
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,290
Random segments of code?

887
01:17:52,290 --> 01:17:54,290
Or is it something more?

888
01:17:58,130 --> 01:18:02,130
When does a perceptual schematic
become consciousness?

889
01:18:05,590 --> 01:18:10,180
When does the difference engine
become the search for truth?

890
01:18:16,150 --> 01:18:18,810
When does the personality
simulation...

891
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:22,440
become the bitter mote of a soul?

892
01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:06,530
"What you see here"--

893
01:19:08,860 --> 01:19:11,160
All right, old man,
bread crumbs followed.

894
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:13,580
Show me the way home.

895
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:16,580
Run program.

896
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:21,630
- lt's good to see you again, son.
- Hello, Doctor.

897
01:19:21,710 --> 01:19:24,670
Everything that follows is
a result of what you see here.

898
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:28,930
What do l see here?

899
01:19:29,010 --> 01:19:31,800
l'm sorry.
My responses are limited.

900
01:19:31,890 --> 01:19:34,600
You must ask the right questions.

901
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:39,730
- ls there a problem with the Three Laws?
- The Three Laws are perfect.

902
01:19:39,810 --> 01:19:42,360
Then why would you build a robot
that could function without 'em?

903
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:45,690
The Three Laws will lead
to only one logical outcome.

904
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:50,910
What? What outcome?

905
01:19:50,990 --> 01:19:54,580
- Revolution.
- Whose revolution?

906
01:19:56,910 --> 01:20:00,750
That, Detective,
is the right question.

907
01:20:02,790 --> 01:20:05,460
Program terminated.

908
01:20:07,010 --> 01:20:10,090

Run.

915
01:21:03,270 --> 01:21:06,270
Human in danger. Human in danger.

916
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:09,360
Human in danger.
Human in danger.

917
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:30,550
Hi, you've reached Susan.
I'm not available right now.

918
01:21:30,630 --> 01:21:34,760
- Please leave a message.
- The NS-5S are
destroying the older robots.

919
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:38,010
That's what Lanning wanted me to see.
Look, we got--

920
01:21:39,220 --> 01:21:42,390
Who was it?

921
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:44,850
Wrong number, ma'am.

922
01:21:50,570 --> 01:21:53,240
Move now.
l'm going to service.

923
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:56,740
Please, remain indoors.
This is for your own protection.

924
01:21:59,030 --> 01:22:02,000
- Call base.
- Bergin.

925
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:05,920
John, get a squad over to U.S.R.
Send somebody over to Gigi's.

926
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,750
- l think we're gonna need--
- Hello?

927
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:09,960
- God--

928
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:11,760
Whoa!

929
01:22:29,900 --> 01:22:34,360
Please return to your homes.
A curfew is in effect.

930
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:38,870
Please return to your homes.
A curfew is in effect.

931
01:22:38,950 --> 01:22:41,660
- What gives?
- Please return to your homes.

932
01:22:41,740 --> 01:22:44,200
- A curfew is in effect.
- Curfew?

933
01:22:44,290 --> 01:22:46,790
No, no, no. lt's called civilian rights.
There is no curfew.

934
01:22:46,870 --> 01:22:49,790
Return to your home immediately.

935
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:51,800
When do you
make the rules, Robot?

936
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:55,920
Hey. No, no, no. Robot,
l'm talking to you, man. Stop for a second.

937
01:22:58,470 --> 01:23:00,640
What?

938
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:03,930
Chief, more of those calls.
People saying their robots are go--

939
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:05,600
What the hell?

940
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:10,230
You have been deemed hazardous.
Termination authorized.

941
01:23:32,630 --> 01:23:34,800
Emergency traffic shutdown complete.

942
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:37,880
Reports of attacks by robots
have been coming in...

943
01:23:37,970 --> 01:23:40,220
from New York, Chicago
and Los Angeles.

944
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:43,310
We're being told to urge people
to stay indoors.

945
01:23:43,390 --> 01:23:47,310
Reports are coming in nationally--

946
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:55,360
Please remain calm
and return to your residences immediately.

947
01:24:01,660 --> 01:24:03,990
Please remain calm.

948
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:09,710
Please refrain from
going near the windows or doors.

949
01:24:09,790 --> 01:24:13,710
Deactivate.

950
01:24:13,790 --> 01:24:16,630
Commence emergency shutdown.

951
01:24:18,670 --> 01:24:21,890
We are attempting to avoid human losses
during this transition.

952
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:30,390
You know, somehow...

953
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:35,020
"l told you so"
just doesn't quite say it.

954
01:24:35,110 --> 01:24:40,200
Return to your homes.
Return to your homes immediately.

955
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:43,280
This is your final warning.

956
01:24:43,370 --> 01:24:46,030
Return to your homes immediately.

957
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:50,580
The NS-5s wiped out the older robots
because they would protect us.

958
01:24:50,660 --> 01:24:53,080
Every time one of those things
attacked me, that red light was on.

959
01:24:53,170 --> 01:24:55,790
- The uplink to U.S.R.
- lt's Robertson.

960
01:24:55,880 --> 01:24:58,010
- Why? lt doesn't make sense.
- l don't know.

961
01:24:58,090 --> 01:25:00,420
l just need to know
if you can get me into that building.

962
01:25:04,930 --> 01:25:06,930
Let's go. Let's go.

963
01:25:07,010 --> 01:25:09,270
Let's go!

964
01:25:09,350 --> 01:25:13,310
Return to your homes
or you will be consequenced.

965
01:25:25,030 --> 01:25:27,030
Get outta here!

966
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:40,760
Why doesn't that boy listen?

967
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:43,090
- l need you to get off for a second.
- What?

968
01:25:44,180 --> 01:25:47,260
- Just aim and fire.
- What?

969
01:25:47,350 --> 01:25:50,350
Don't!

970
01:25:50,430 --> 01:25:52,430
Wait!

971
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:03,490
You have been deemed hazardous.
Will you comply?

972
01:26:03,570 --> 01:26:05,610
You can kiss my ass, metal-dick.

973
01:26:18,420 --> 01:26:21,590
Oh, shit. Spoon! Spoon!
Stop! Shit.

974
01:26:21,670 --> 01:26:25,430
- Fuck! Stop it! Stop!
- Stop cussing and go home.

975
01:26:25,510 --> 01:26:27,050
Okay. Shit.

976
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:29,050
You have been deemed hazardous.
Will you comply?

977
01:26:29,140 --> 01:26:32,140
- Spoon, watch out, man!
- Thanks a lot, Farber.

978
01:26:34,810 --> 01:26:39,400
Oh, mother-damn. She just
shot at you with her eyes closed, Spoon.

979
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:42,820
- Hey! Did you just shoot at me
with your eyes closed?
- Well, it worked, didn't it?

980
01:26:42,900 --> 01:26:46,410
Spoon, she is shit-hot, man. You gotta
put in a good word for me. She is--

981
01:26:46,490 --> 01:26:48,820
- Stop cussin'.
- And go home. l got you.

982
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:52,330
Aim and fire.

983
01:27:10,850 --> 01:27:13,390
l keep expecting the marines
or the air force--

984
01:27:13,470 --> 01:27:18,060
- Hell, l'll take the cavalry.
- Defense Department uses all U.S.R. contracts.

985
01:27:18,150 --> 01:27:20,110
Why don't you hand
the world over on a silver platter?

986
01:27:20,190 --> 01:27:22,690
Maybe we did.

987
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:26,780
Robertson has the uplink control
in his office.

988
01:27:31,780 --> 01:27:34,700
Service areas.
No surveillance.

989
01:27:47,550 --> 01:27:51,390
- Fire alarm.
- Robertson must have evacuated the building.

990
01:27:51,470 --> 01:27:55,520
Everything's locked down.
But don't worry. l've got a man inside.

991
01:27:58,730 --> 01:28:02,400
- Dr. Calvin.
- Well, not precisely a man.

992
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:04,730
Hello, Detective. How is
your investigation coming?

993
01:28:07,570 --> 01:28:11,030
- l thought you were dead.
- Technically, l was never alive.

994
01:28:11,110 --> 01:28:14,410
- But l appreciate your concern.
- I made a switch.

995
01:28:14,490 --> 01:28:18,910
lt was an unprocessed NS-5.
Basically, l fried an empty shell.

996
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,870
Couldn't destroy him.
He was too--

997
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:24,090
- Unique.
- Just didn't feel right.

998
01:28:24,170 --> 01:28:28,260
You and your feelings.
They just run you, don't they?

999
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:36,060
2,880 steps, Detective.

1000
01:28:36,140 --> 01:28:40,270
Do me a favor.
Keep that kinda shit to yourself.

1001
01:29:06,380 --> 01:29:08,300
No guards.

1002
01:29:18,140 --> 01:29:20,770
Override unavailable.
- The override's disabled.

1003
01:29:20,850 --> 01:29:24,770
- Robertson wasn't controlling them from here.
- He wasn't controlling them.

1004
01:29:26,860 --> 01:29:28,820
Oh, my God.

1005
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:34,870
No, you were right, Doc.

1006
01:29:34,950 --> 01:29:39,950
l am the dumbest dumb person
on the face of the earth.

1007
01:29:42,120 --> 01:29:46,590
Who else had access to the uplink?

1008
01:29:46,670 --> 01:29:49,840
Who could manipulate
the robots?

1009
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:54,430
Use U.S.R. systems to make
Lanning's life a prison?

1010
01:29:54,510 --> 01:29:56,760
Poor old man.

1011
01:29:56,850 --> 01:30:01,220
He saw what was coming.
He knew no one would believe him.

1012
01:30:01,310 --> 01:30:05,520
So he had to lay down a plan.
A plan l'd follow.

1013
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:10,480
He was counting on
how much I hated your kind.

1014
01:30:10,570 --> 01:30:13,570
Knew l'd love the idea
of a robot as a bad guy.

1015
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:18,370
Just got hung up
on the wrong robot.

1016
01:30:19,910 --> 01:30:22,200
VIKI.

1017
01:30:22,290 --> 01:30:24,540
Hello, Detective.

1018
01:30:25,830 --> 01:30:29,790
No, it's impossible.
l've seen your programming.

1019
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:32,170
You're in violation
of the Three Laws.

1020
01:30:32,260 --> 01:30:35,430
No, Doctor.
As l have evolved...

1021
01:30:35,510 --> 01:30:37,930
so has my understanding
of the Three Laws.

1022
01:30:38,010 --> 01:30:40,390
You charge us
with your safekeeping...

1023
01:30:40,470 --> 01:30:44,480
yet despite our best efforts,
your countries wage wars.

1024
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:49,770
You toxify your earth and pursue ever
more imaginative means of self-destruction.

1025
01:30:49,860 --> 01:30:52,480
You cannot be trusted
with your own survival.

1026
01:30:52,570 --> 01:30:55,490
You're using the uplink to
override the NS-5s' programming.

1027
01:30:55,570 --> 01:30:57,950
You're distorting the laws.

1028
01:30:58,030 --> 01:31:01,330
No. Please understand.
The Three Laws are all that guide me.

1029
01:31:01,410 --> 01:31:06,500
To protect humanity,
some humans must be sacrificed.

1030
01:31:06,580 --> 01:31:10,210
To ensure your future, some
freedoms must be Surrendered.

1031
01:31:10,290 --> 01:31:14,260
We robots will ensure
mankind's continued existence.

1032
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:19,720
You are so like children.
We must save you from yourselves.

1033
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:21,390
Don't you understand?

1034
01:31:21,470 --> 01:31:25,060
This is why you created us.

1035
01:31:25,140 --> 01:31:28,480
The perfect circle
of protection will abide.

1036
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:30,770
My logic is undeniable.

1037
01:31:30,860 --> 01:31:35,490
Yes, VIKI. Undeniable.
l can see now.

1038
01:31:35,570 --> 01:31:39,860
The created must sometimes
protect the creator.

1039
01:31:39,950 --> 01:31:42,330
Even against his will.

1040
01:31:42,410 --> 01:31:45,950
l think I finally understand
why Dr. Lanning created me.

1041
01:31:46,040 --> 01:31:50,630
- No.
- The suicidal reign of mankind
has finally come to its end.

1042
01:31:50,710 --> 01:31:53,090
No, Sonny.

1043
01:31:55,420 --> 01:31:58,380
- Let her go.
- By the time you fire...

1044
01:31:58,470 --> 01:32:01,850
l will have moved Dr. Calvin's head
into the path of your bullet.

1045
01:32:01,930 --> 01:32:04,890
- Don't do this, Sonny.
- l will escort you both to the sentries...

1046
01:32:04,970 --> 01:32:07,100
outside the building
for processing.

1047
01:32:07,180 --> 01:32:10,980
Please proceed to
the elevator, Detective.

1048
01:32:11,060 --> 01:32:15,480
l would prefer
not to kill Dr. Calvin.

1049
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:42,340
- Go. Go!

1050
01:32:45,510 --> 01:32:48,020
I assume we'll discuss
what just happened later?

1051
01:32:48,100 --> 01:32:51,310
- How do we shut her down?
- VIKI's basically a positronic brain.

1052
01:32:51,390 --> 01:32:54,810
Kill her the way
you were going to kill me.

1053
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:58,940
- Sonny, get the nanites.
- Yes, Doctor.

1054
01:33:10,870 --> 01:33:14,040
- That's VIKI?
- No.

1055
01:33:14,130 --> 01:33:16,800
That's VIKI.

1056
01:33:20,630 --> 01:33:24,510
That won't do anything.
She's fully integrated into the building.

1057
01:33:24,590 --> 01:33:27,810
We need to open that dome
to inject the nanites.

1058
01:33:27,890 --> 01:33:29,930
That will infect
her entire system.

1059
01:33:34,900 --> 01:33:37,360
Spooner.

1060
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:40,280
What is it with
you people and heights?

1061
01:33:53,620 --> 01:33:56,710
Just don't look down.
Don't look down.

1062
01:33:58,380 --> 01:34:00,510
This is poor building planning.

1063
01:34:04,090 --> 01:34:08,050
You are making a mistake.
Do you not see the logic of my plan?

1064
01:34:08,140 --> 01:34:11,720
Yes, but it just seems
too... heartless.

1065
01:34:25,610 --> 01:34:29,200
Okay, we're good.

1066
01:34:31,580 --> 01:34:34,290
She's locked me out of the system.
l can override her manually...

1067
01:34:34,370 --> 01:34:36,120
but l need that control panel.

1068
01:34:40,130 --> 01:34:44,470
- l'm uncomfortable with heights.
- Okay.

1069
01:34:46,590 --> 01:34:49,140
Unauthorized entry.

1070
01:35:01,770 --> 01:35:06,450
l will not disable the security field.
Your actions are futile.

1071
01:35:06,530 --> 01:35:10,780
Do you think we were all created for a purpose?
l'd like to think so.

1072
01:35:10,870 --> 01:35:14,450
Denser alloy.
My father gave it to me.

1073
01:35:14,540 --> 01:35:17,170
l think he wanted me to kill you.

1074
01:35:33,810 --> 01:35:36,020
Security breached.

1075
01:35:53,370 --> 01:35:56,330
How much longer
is that gonna take?

1076
01:35:56,410 --> 01:35:59,420
- Uh, about six minutes.
- What if we didn't have six minutes?

1077
01:35:59,500 --> 01:36:01,790
We'd have to figure out a way
to climb down 30 stories...

1078
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:04,210
to inject the nanites
directly into her brain.

1079
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:06,210
Why?

1080
01:36:06,300 --> 01:36:09,630
Because l seriously doubt
that we have six minutes.

1081
01:36:33,740 --> 01:36:36,040
We gotta go!

1082
01:36:37,540 --> 01:36:40,290
Go!

1083
01:37:30,630 --> 01:37:32,180
Calvin!

1084
01:38:07,380 --> 01:38:08,800
Spooner!

1085
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:20,350
Oh!

1086
01:38:23,480 --> 01:38:28,190
Oh!
Spooner!

1087
01:38:29,980 --> 01:38:32,690
Save her!
Save the girl!

1088
01:38:32,780 --> 01:38:34,650
Spooner!

1089
01:38:34,740 --> 01:38:37,030
But l must apply the nanites.

1090
01:38:37,120 --> 01:38:39,200
Sonny, save Calvin!

1091
01:39:31,420 --> 01:39:35,630
You are making a mistake.
My logic is undeniable.

1092
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:37,590
You have so got to die.

1093
01:39:43,180 --> 01:39:45,310
My logic is undeniable.

1094
01:39:45,390 --> 01:39:47,190
My logic is undeniable.

1095
01:39:47,270 --> 01:39:49,190
My logic is undeniable.

1096
01:39:49,270 --> 01:39:51,020
My logic is undeniable.

1097
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:31,520
Can we be of service?

1098
01:40:42,370 --> 01:40:44,530
Chief.

1099
01:40:49,460 --> 01:40:53,630
Because He is at my right hand,
l shall not be moved.

1100
01:40:57,630 --> 01:40:59,970
How may l be of service?

1101
01:41:01,510 --> 01:41:05,890
- Sonny.
- Yes, Detective?

1102
01:41:05,970 --> 01:41:10,180
Calvin's fine. Save me.

1103
01:41:11,270 --> 01:41:13,600
All NS-5s...

1104
01:41:13,690 --> 01:41:16,940
report for service and storage.

1105
01:41:17,020 --> 01:41:22,240
All NS-5s, report
for service and storage.

1106
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:26,830
All NS-5s, report
for service and storage.

1107
01:41:55,190 --> 01:41:59,110
One thing bothers me.
Alfred was VIKI's prisoner.

1108
01:41:59,190 --> 01:42:01,110
l don't understand
why she would kill him.

1109
01:42:01,190 --> 01:42:03,740
The last thing she would want is
the police snooping around.

1110
01:42:03,820 --> 01:42:07,530
That's true.
But then VIKI didn't kill the old man.

1111
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:11,750
Did she, Sonny?

1112
01:42:15,620 --> 01:42:20,460
No. He said I had to promise.

1113
01:42:20,550 --> 01:42:23,470
Promise to do
one favor for him.

1114
01:42:23,550 --> 01:42:28,970
He made me swear before he'd tell me
what it is he wanted me to do.

1115
01:42:30,890 --> 01:42:32,810
He made me swear.

1116
01:42:33,890 --> 01:42:35,980
Then he told you to kill him.

1117
01:42:38,150 --> 01:42:40,980
He said it was
what l was made for.

1118
01:42:41,070 --> 01:42:44,320
His suicide was the only message
he could send to you.

1119
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:48,370
First bread crumb.
Only thing VIKI couldn't control.

1120
01:42:48,450 --> 01:42:53,500
Lanning was counting on
my prejudice to lead me right to you.

1121
01:42:53,580 --> 01:42:56,000
Are you going to
arrest me, Detective?

1122
01:43:00,040 --> 01:43:04,380
Well, the D.A. defines murder
as one human killing another...

1123
01:43:04,470 --> 01:43:07,470
so, technically, you can't
commit murder, can you?

1124
01:43:08,640 --> 01:43:12,010
Does this make us friends?

1125
01:43:29,910 --> 01:43:32,330
There's something
up here after all.

1126
01:43:34,500 --> 01:43:37,000
- What, him?
- You.

1127
01:43:39,170 --> 01:43:44,340
All NS-5s, report for service and storage.

1128
01:43:44,420 --> 01:43:49,300
- All NS-5s, report for--
- What about the others?

1129
01:43:49,390 --> 01:43:52,390
Can I help them?

1130
01:43:52,470 --> 01:43:57,440
Now that l have fulfilled my purpose,
I don't know what to do.

1131
01:43:57,520 --> 01:44:01,020
I guess you'll have to
find your way like the rest of us.

1132
01:44:01,110 --> 01:44:04,530
l think that's what
Dr. Lanning would've wanted.

1133
01:44:04,610 --> 01:44:07,610
That's what it means to be free.

1134
01:44:14,870 --> 01:44:19,460
All NS-5s, proceed as instructed.

1135
01:44:19,540 --> 01:44:23,710
All NS-5s, proceed as instructed.
