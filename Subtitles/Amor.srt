00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:51,777
THE TRUE STORIES IN THIS FILM

2
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:55,221
WERE COLLECTED DURING
A LONG PERIOD OF RESEARCH

3
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:58,558
AND ARE PLAYED
BYACTRESSES AND ACTORS.

4
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:01,959
THE ORIGINAL TESTIMONIES
WERE NOTALTERED.

5
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:10,650
So... she was seven.

6
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:16,151
She had childhood-onset diabetes.

7
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,198
She passed out,

8
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,758
but actually
she went into cardiac arrest.

9
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:27,567
This daughter was seven
and my younger one was four.

10
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:31,311
Then it was all over.

11
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:32,972
l lost my bearings.

12
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:36,616
My husband, poorthing...

13
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:40,620
Soon after she died,
he left hisjob.

14
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,922
So our lives stopped.

15
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:47,086
We had no money.
No money at all.

16
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:50,230
He started to drink.

17
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,199
He'd come home plastered.

18
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:57,437
And he wasn't
the typical cliché drunk.

19
00:03:57,437 --> 00:04:00,838
He'd come home mute.
He wouldn't say a word.

20
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:05,678
So l became
more and more aggressive.

21
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:10,741
ln a really destructive way.

22
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:14,745
ln an evil way, you know?
Really bad.

23
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,190
l've always been
very aggressive.

24
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,454
Maybe it was a defense of mine.

25
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:24,397
So when l bought something,
l'd tell him,

26
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:27,958
''See, l bought this.
You can't buy that.''

27
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:30,203
And in the meantime,

28
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:34,264
he got back his self-esteem.

29
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:38,911
So when l hurt him,
he hurt me back.

30
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:41,175
l stood it, he stood it.

31
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:44,074
l rememberthat one day...

32
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:48,977
l don't knowwhat l said,
but l said something...

33
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:51,424
and he pushed me.

34
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:54,827
He pushed me,
so l pushed him back.

35
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:59,232
And l said, ''You can't talk
to me like that.''

36
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:00,927
l was feeling my oats.

37
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,870
He didn't hesitate,
he grabbed me,

38
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,135
he lift me up,
and threwme against the wall.

39
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:11,377
l hit the wall very hard.

40
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:14,244
l was bruised all over.
All over.

41
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:19,140
He left home,
and l went to my brother's house.

42
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,888
This was about 3:00 AM.

43
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:23,856
And l was crying, crying.

44
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,592
And the next day,
l asked him to leave.

45
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:30,697
He went to his parents' home
in Santo André.

46
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:34,064
Two months later,

47
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:39,906
everything l wanted
to happen before,

48
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:41,708
happened then.

49
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,110
We had a daughter, Juliana...

50
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,813
He would call
to get news about her.

51
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:50,579
But he called in a nice way.

52
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:53,779
''Let's talk.'' You know?

53
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:58,283
So we started dating.

54
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,864
We dated about
four or five months.

55
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,424
lt was the best time of my life.

56
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:13,206
And a real mature passion
came out ifthis.

57
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,108
So respectful.

58
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:18,978
We'd talk about everything,
even about what happened.

59
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:21,037
We talked about it.

60
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:25,084
So one day he said,
''l shouldn't have done that,

61
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:27,687
but you knowhowl am...

62
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:29,689
l have these outbursts,

63
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:33,593
l really have a temper,
but you provoked me.''

64
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:36,796
And l did,
l did provoke him.

65
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:40,099
What kind ofthings
he belittle about you?

66
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:41,901
-At that time?
-Yeah.

67
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,766
He belittled everything.

68
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,306
The silliest,
most cliché thing...

69
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:51,072
For instance...
you cut your hair.

70
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:54,677
And he doesn't say anything.

71
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:57,717
lt can't be
that he didn't notice.

72
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:59,419
Ok, l believe,
he doesn't notice.

73
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,013
Bit it's horrible.
lt's horrible.

74
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:07,860
Oryou make this big effort
to lose seven pounds. Seven.

75
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,763
lt's real hard
to lose seven pounds.

76
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:13,766
So you put on tight clothes
to get his attention,

77
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,859
and he doesn't say a word?

78
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:21,274
He sawit, noticed it,
but didn't say a word.

79
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,367
That pissed me off.

80
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:26,679
When we got back together,
one day, l asked him,

81
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:29,582
''Marcos, why haven't you ever
praised me?

82
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:33,848
How can we have a relationship
ifl don't feel admired by you?

83
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:37,549
He said, ''l admire you.''

84
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:40,693
l told him,
''But you have to say it.''

85
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:44,561
''l do?''
''Of course you do''

86
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:49,502
And he said, ''So you're
that kind of person...''

87
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:51,504
Howwas it? He said...

88
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:56,168
''So you're that kind of person
who always needs a compliment?''

89
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,604
As if needing a compliment
was a bad thing.

90
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:04,250
That really messed
with my head,

91
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,452
but l mustered the courage
and said,

92
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:09,555
''Marcos, l need compliments.

93
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:11,457
l need compliments,

94
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:15,917
the Yankees fans need compliments,
everyone needs compliments.''

95
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:19,866
And there is
this otherthing...

96
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:23,669
l had a problem,
l worked a lot.

97
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:29,475
l was always a bit negligent
caring forthe kids and the house,

98
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:34,344
and he took that,
he used that.

99
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,441
Because...

100
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:40,186
that would be my big flaw.

101
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:43,489
The impossibility of caring
for my girls,

102
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:46,092
sitting, playing with them.

103
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:48,856
This kind of...

104
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:51,160
maternal thing really.

105
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,601
Actually,
l never had the patience.

106
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:58,297
l don't have
a lot of patience for that.

107
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:00,740
l'm not very maternal.

108
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,742
So l'd get home and say,

109
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:05,711
''l got more money.
l won another case.''

110
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:10,249
''Your daughter Juliana waited
at school until six o'clock.''

111
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:15,118
So he kept working
on lowering my self-esteem.

112
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:18,416
When we got back together...

113
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:22,321
you knownobody
changes over night.

114
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:26,823
So what happened?

115
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:31,170
We could only continue
being the same people

116
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:36,233
because it was very clear to me
the bad things that he did.

117
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:39,472
Maybe he does it to this day.

118
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,946
You knowthose women
who love to get beaten?

119
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:46,349
l began to wonder
ifl was one.

120
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:49,989
l don't like
getting beat up.

121
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:52,958
But sometimes
l think it's necessary.

122
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:57,258
You knowkids who need
a smack to knowtheir limits?

123
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,956
l think it was a bit like that.

124
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:06,205
And there's something else
l worked on in therapy.

125
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:13,407
lt's the possibility
of really being a woman.

126
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:20,783
From the moment l took on
my role as a woman,

127
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:25,081
my relationship,
and everything else...

128
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:27,426
My relationship improved.

129
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:32,386
So you had to be beaten
to take on your role as a woman?

130
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:35,493
Exactly.

131
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:39,993
And he took on the man's role
after he hit me.

132
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:44,343
Because he started bringing
money in, paying the bills.

133
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:47,446
But when you said
you took on the woman's role,

134
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:49,607
what exactly is that?

135
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,815
l can't really explain it.

136
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:57,914
One day my therapist asked me,

137
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:00,059
''Why did you marry him?''

138
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:05,463
l told her, ''Fuck,
he's real cute, he's gentle.''

139
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:10,560
And she asked,
''Why don't you showthat to him?''

140
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:17,665
So l became a nicer person.

141
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:23,416
Despite being very aggressive
my whole life,

142
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:27,477
l found out that
l can be a gentle person.

143
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,489
A very gentle,
caring, and romantic person.

144
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:37,485
l started to laugh,
l became happier, a fun person.

145
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,827
l mock everything.

146
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:45,692
So l had this reunion
with my delicacy, you know?

147
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:48,739
lt was really nice.

148
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:53,345
When l went to bed,
l started to hug Marcos,

149
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:55,506
to run my hand over his hair.

150
00:11:56,449 --> 00:12:01,087
lfl noticed he was strange,
was a little down,

151
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:03,089
l'd say to him,
''What's going on?''

152
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:05,956
Gently, really gently.

153
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:12,956
An open attitude.
That was nice.

154
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:21,271
That changes a lot.
That makes a world of difference.

155
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:57,293
Of course, all this
had a beginning.

156
00:13:57,736 --> 00:14:00,000
To me it had a very clear start.

157
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:03,338
My mother was beaten up.

158
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,079
When l was a boy,
l sawmy mother being beat up

159
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:09,946
by people she had
relationships with.

160
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:15,452
And a certain person
beat my mother badly.

161
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:20,292
To the point ofleaving
my mom in the middle ofthe street,

162
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:25,958
fallen, passed out,
and all that.

163
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,467
Up until l was 15, 16,
l went through this.

164
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:35,708
l wanted to kill people
who did this to my mother.

165
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,309
l actually picked up a gun

166
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:39,912
to shoot the guy
who did that to my mother...

167
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:41,573
who wasn't my father.

168
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:46,378
My father hit her a fewtimes,
because...

169
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,123
There's nojustification,
but actually my mom

170
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:52,988
drove my father crazy.

171
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:57,293
My mom...
my mom humiliated him.

172
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:06,538
My father was a naval officer
and she'd say, ''You're illiterate.

173
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:12,378
l'm forced to live in the suburbs,
in this miserable life,

174
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:14,680
when l wanted to live
in a good neighborhood,

175
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,482
and have a good life.

176
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:21,487
But you can never give me anything
because you're a crummy NCO,

177
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:24,251
from a poorfamily,
with no money.''

178
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,753
ln fact, my mother's family
was poortoo.

179
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:33,999
Because herfather hit her a lot
when she was a girl.

180
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:37,803
So she rebelled
against the husband

181
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:40,465
as a way to rebel
against her dad.

182
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:43,368
Or maybe imitate him.

183
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,770
l mean,
nowl see things like that.

184
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:53,076
And l myself began to hit girls
l was dating.

185
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,579
Which was one way to redeem
my mom for being beat up.

186
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:02,620
When l was 18, l remember
l hit my girlfriend.

187
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,932
Kid stuff, jealousy,
lack of respect.

188
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:11,124
But she also hit me,
jealous of some girl.

189
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,173
She tried to slap me,

190
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:17,040
but l was quicker
and hit her.

191
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,983
So l got used to hitting her,
l hit her several times.

192
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,747
That's something l regret.

193
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:30,255
She was a good girl,
a great person.

194
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:37,196
l started dating this guy
when l was 16.

195
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:40,299
He was my first boyfriend,
he was 20 years old.

196
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:44,103
l thought l was
an angel in his life.

197
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:47,406
The first strange thing
that happened was like this...

198
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:50,309
We had a group
that used to go out to dance.

199
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:54,313
l went out one day,
but l said l wouldn't dance.

200
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:55,914
l went to the bathroom

201
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:57,716
and there was this guy
from the group.

202
00:16:57,716 --> 00:17:01,153
He asked me to dance
and l said okay.

203
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:02,755
l danced with the guy.

204
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:05,223
My boyfriend looked radiant.

205
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:08,820
We left,
but he didn't say anything.

206
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:11,923
lt took him 3 months
to mention it.

207
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:16,068
But every time he mentioned it
we'd argue.

208
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:18,570
''That day you said
you wouldn't dance, but you did.''

209
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,973
And then the threatening
tone began.

210
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,776
He'd say, ''You think l didn't do
anything to that guy?''

211
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:26,278
And l wondered ifhe really
did something.

212
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:28,644
Was he capable
of doing something?

213
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:32,584
l still believed
he could change.

214
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:35,087
Then came the time
when l realized

215
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:38,624
he was never going to change.
So l tried to break up.

216
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:41,491
l tried, but he started
to threat me even more.

217
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:44,997
He said he'd kill me,
kill my uncle,

218
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:47,261
my mother, my whole family.

219
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,803
At first you hear that
and you think,

220
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:53,005
''l'm going to turn my back
and walk away.

221
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:55,007
This guy is nuts.
Just let him talk.

222
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:59,011
But it's not so easy.
Because there was a history.

223
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:01,747
There was this personality
problem l began to notice.

224
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,249
l didn't knowwhen
he was telling the truth

225
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:08,345
and when he was threatening me
so l'd be afraid ofhim.

226
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:14,617
Time went on and l became
addicted to beating people.

227
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:20,630
The women l dated,
the women l had sex with.

228
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:24,227
Sometimes, l became violent.

229
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:28,273
lfthe girl didn't like it,
l'd take a step back.

230
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:31,333
But if she liked it,
l had no limits.

231
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,244
l could really hurt her.

232
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:39,485
And this comes from something
that has no explanation.

233
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:43,046
lt can become an addiction,
a pattern.

234
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:48,949
No, no, l have two lovely,
marvelous girls.

235
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:52,757
But unfortunately
l hurt my wife a lot.

236
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:56,467
After my children were born,
l stopped hitting her.

237
00:18:57,402 --> 00:19:03,242
l mean, l didn't stop
being an aggressive person.

238
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:05,403
Other kinds
of aggression continued.

239
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:09,710
But the heavy
boxer type of aggression ended.

240
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:16,319
This is something
that really stayed with me.

241
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:20,324
The fact that l hit my wife.

242
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:23,523
Awoman who only did
good things for me,

243
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:27,229
who loved me,
and who l loved back.

244
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:30,025
But l had the nerve to hit her.

245
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:34,230
That's something l can't forgive,
that has no explanation.

246
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:39,077
l don't knowif you've gone
through something like that.

247
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:41,739
lf you haven't, thank God.

248
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:46,185
But it doesn't depend
on anything out ofthe ordinary.

249
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:51,452
These things come from
the most trivial human relations.

250
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,692
The desire to hurt.

251
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:57,150
Everything is an excuse,
There's the need to hurt.

252
00:19:58,096 --> 00:19:59,961
lt's almost physiological.

253
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:02,492
lt's like our need...

254
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:06,205
to eat... to shit...

255
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:10,164
to piss... to fuck...
Get it?

256
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:13,473
lt's a need to hurt.

257
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:17,516
But afteryou satisfy
this awful instinct,

258
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:19,575
you regret it.

259
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,489
And there are people who don't,
which is worse.

260
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:31,896
Can you excuse me a minute?

261
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:35,195
Hi, honey. Yeah.

262
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:39,834
No, l'm doing the interview
l told you.

263
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:44,498
REENACTMENTOF A SITUATION
THAT OCCURRED DURING THE RESEARCH

264
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:48,647
She wants to continue
listening to the conversation.

265
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:50,808
ls that okay?

266
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:55,254
Sex was something l did
to calm him down.

267
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,916
l didn't want to do it,
l couldn't bear looking at him.

268
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,492
So l kept making up excuses.

269
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:02,694
One week passed, two,

270
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:04,896
by the third week,
he wanted to beat me.

271
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:06,693
So l did it.

272
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:09,901
But l couldn't let it show
that l didn't want to do it.

273
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:12,104
He asked if it was
an obligation for me.

274
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,406
''No, why are you saying that?''

275
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:18,010
He said, ''l can tell
you didn't want it.''

276
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:23,515
lfl said l did,
he'd get medieval on me.

277
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:26,382
That was my defense mechanism.

278
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:34,390
l used to say,
''Today l have to want it.''

279
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:39,192
Because then he'd be calm
and l could have some peace.

280
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:44,600
l worked as a dentist
for a long time.

281
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:50,006
Physically, l have no doubt
women are stronger than men.

282
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:55,004
Women's resistance to pain
is much greaterthan men's.

283
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:58,710
Men would piss themselves
to sit on my chair.

284
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,286
Women didn't even blink.

285
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:04,346
Very fewwomen
ever showed any fear.

286
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:09,059
Men used to offer me money
to not feel any pain.

287
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:14,800
Men are really
sons oftheir mothers!

288
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,036
They have to get rid
of this fucking Oedipus,

289
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:21,369
this dependency,
this umbilical cord.

290
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:29,114
Men have to emancipate themselves
orthey'll go on making women suffer.

291
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:34,319
Because usually
the man can't give love.

292
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:36,421
He doesn't know
howto love back.

293
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:38,724
He's selfish, you know?

294
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:43,028
Because the best place is his,
the best food is his,

295
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:46,031
the TV channel is his,
and that's fucked up.

296
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:49,735
l say this and it sounds
like l'm this model citizen,

297
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:52,203
but l'm not. l suffer
from all these things.

298
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:55,907
l'll need a fewincarnations
to heal this stuff.

299
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:59,945
There was this situation

300
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:03,181
around the end of last year,
close to the end.

301
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:07,085
l called him and asked him
not to come to pick me up,

302
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:08,987
because my father was coming.
So he asked why.

303
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:11,046
l told him
my father was coming.

304
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,525
And the threatening tone
started again,

305
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:15,527
my stomach would be
in knots instantly.

306
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:19,054
He said he was coming
because l'd done something wrong.

307
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:25,103
So he came to pick me up
and l couldn't react.

308
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:27,205
Because l did everything
he told me to.

309
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:30,008
He said, ''l'm picking you up.''
l said okay.

310
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:32,711
Because l was very afraid
ofhis reaction.

311
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:35,179
So l couldn't go against
anything he said.

312
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:38,517
l got in the car and he said,

313
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:41,620
''We're going to my house
and you're taking off your clothes

314
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:44,523
and ifl find any marks
that showyou betrayed me,

315
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:46,889
you'll regret
having been born.''

316
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:51,329
He kept saying that
and it got into my head,

317
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:55,834
because l knew
l hadn't done anything,

318
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:58,837
but l was thinking,

319
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:01,173
''My God, something
is going to happen.''

320
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:02,574
l was sure of it.

321
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:05,941
he was going to find
some invisible mark.

322
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:13,385
We got to his house,
and l turned around for him,

323
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:18,790
he was looking at me and said,
''What is this?''

324
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,350
l said, ''The mark of my bra.''

325
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:25,053
Then he said, ''Okay.''

326
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:29,801
As ifl was a piece of meat
on display,

327
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:32,463
a rotisserie chicken
turning around.

328
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:37,108
l got dressed, l went home.

329
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:40,812
He was going to take me, and said,
''l'm not taking you home.

330
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:43,715
lf you go home, you're going
to see TV and laugh.

331
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:47,674
So you're coming to my house
and stay there with no TV.''

332
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:51,022
He took me, shut the door,
turned the TVoff

333
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:53,217
and we were there
till midnight.

334
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,919
All this because
he didn't want me to laugh.

335
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:59,164
lt was very crazy,
he couldn't stand me to be happy.

336
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,359
That was his objective.

337
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:05,170
lt's a fact. One thing
is the psychological,

338
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,872
the other is the physical.

339
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:10,275
And they mess with you so much
that you actually believe it.

340
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:13,378
Sometimes l stop
and l think,

341
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:17,838
''l did something wrong,
l'm the guilty one.''

342
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:21,543
l've always been very jealous.

343
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:25,155
My thing isjealousy.

344
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:27,652
l'm very jealous.

345
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:30,657
She's here,
on the phone with me.

346
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:34,896
She lives in Spain
and l live in Brazil.

347
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,558
lt's hard.

348
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:40,466
Man, this is something
very private.

349
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:43,171
Forthe love of God.

350
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:47,078
Not that l'm hiding her
from anyone.

351
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:53,375
l'm still living
with my ex-wife.

352
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:56,383
We're actually separated.

353
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:58,982
Not legally, but we are.

354
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:03,161
l want the best for my ex
and she wants the best for me.

355
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:05,220
That to me is a victory.

356
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:09,225
To be friends,
after we separated.

357
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:12,370
And why did you want
your girlfriend to hear all this?

358
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:15,373
Because l'd already had episodes
of violence with her.

359
00:26:15,373 --> 00:26:16,931
For what reason?

360
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:22,640
The same thing that always
moves me with women.

361
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:25,884
My insecurity,
excessivejealousy,

362
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:27,943
a need to punish.

363
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:32,390
l think this
goes back to my mother,

364
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,858
it's a hard thing to resolve.

365
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:37,552
You want to know something?

366
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:42,265
l think my mother deserved
the beating she got from my dad.

367
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:45,465
Not from the other guy,
but from my dad.

368
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:48,707
My mother drove
my father crazy.

369
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:50,609
And he wasn't a guy
to hit women.

370
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:54,813
She humiliated him,
attacked him physically,

371
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:56,715
hit him in the face,

372
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:59,117
broke his comb,
ran it on his face,

373
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:02,554
stamped on his clothes,
threwthem down in the mud.

374
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:04,556
There came a moment
when he lost control,

375
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:08,720
he hit her back.
So he hit her with a...

376
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:13,328
The guy was a naval officer,
a boxer, fucking strong.

377
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:16,525
My mom was skinny, 86 pounds.

378
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:20,033
The first time he hit her,

379
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,464
he broke her denture.

380
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:31,338
l'll tell you,
it's tragic and it's comic.

381
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:34,085
lt's comic.

382
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:36,488
You knowas a filmmaker,

383
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:39,355
that nothing is so tragic
that isn't also comical.

384
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:43,454
Now, after so many years,
l can find it funny.

385
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:48,955
My father broke my mom's
and the maid's dentures.

386
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:51,603
l mean, it was a lot of damage.

387
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:54,970
But it was profitable
forthe dentist.

388
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:57,509
The maid tried to help my mom,

389
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:00,211
my father hit the maid too.

390
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:03,048
And also broke her denture.

391
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:05,850
THE INTERVIEWEE
KEPTTHE CELL PHONE AT HIS EAR

392
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,353
DURING THE WHOLE
RESEARCH INTERVIEW

393
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,514
This movie can turn
into a comedy.

394
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,217
Are you satisfied?

395
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,260
lt was clingy.

396
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:14,669
From my part it was clingy.

397
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:18,373
And men, when they get clingy...

398
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,579
l think that was my mistake.

399
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:28,476
l really fell for her!

400
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,788
l spent 15 days in her home.

401
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:36,089
l left my wife, my kids,
to be with her.

402
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:39,230
The mother of my kids said

403
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:43,997
it was a complicated moment
in our relationship.

404
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:49,504
Because l've been married
with her for 28 years, man.

405
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:52,202
l raised five kids with her.

406
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:55,046
And there are two small ones.

407
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:57,482
That complicated it even more

408
00:31:57,482 --> 00:31:59,609
to suddenly be living
with the mistress.

409
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:03,788
So once l was close to Butantã,
going by her house.

410
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:06,552
Then l called her.

411
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:11,753
She asked me to bring
something from the market for her.

412
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:17,402
l went to the market
and bought what she asked.

413
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:20,769
As l was leaving the market,

414
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:24,008
l sawthis guy who lived
close to her.

415
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:25,910
And he came with this boy.

416
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:28,112
lt was really hot that day.

417
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:31,015
So l said, ''Hey, Júlio,
don't you want a ride?

418
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:33,882
Come in
and l'll take you there.''

419
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:39,782
So l dropped the guy off
and got late at her house.

420
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:42,190
She blewup, man.

421
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,028
She exploded.

422
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:45,893
She was with her girl.

423
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,533
She went to the door screaming.

424
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:51,195
All the houses
are close to each other.

425
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:56,798
So l kind of pushed her back.

426
00:32:57,742 --> 00:33:01,379
And she called her mother,
this time she did.

427
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:02,981
She never called.

428
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:06,246
And she went to the precinct
to make a complaint.

429
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:12,145
That's when she asked
for a restraining order.

430
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:15,693
Why didn't she come to me?

431
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:19,254
Why didn't she tell me
about that restraining order?

432
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:22,000
lt could have been
just a thing ofthe moment.

433
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,468
But at the time,
l didn't understand that.

434
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:27,168
l started to drink.

435
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:30,267
l felt really bad
with the restraining order.

436
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:37,015
We had another date,
we had ice cream,

437
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:40,218
me, her, and her little girl.
She has a three-year-old.

438
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:42,520
Actually,
l'm the girl's godfather.

439
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,488
l baptized her.

440
00:33:45,923 --> 00:33:46,981
Got it?

441
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:55,197
What was the incident
that made you lose control?

442
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:02,831
She worked on a Sunday.

443
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,844
No, she worked from Saturday
to Sunday.

444
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:09,341
She says she did.

445
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:11,944
She worked,
but she didn't call me.

446
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:18,749
That made me wonder...

447
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:21,253
lt began to influence me.

448
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:25,258
She never stopped
at the pay phone.

449
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:29,300
Was it so hard to call me?
Even if she had no cell on her.

450
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:32,463
She could find a pay phone
and say,

451
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:37,969
''Paulo, l'm doing a night shift.
l'm working all night.''

452
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:44,980
Was it so hard
for herto call me?

453
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:47,582
Tell me.

454
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,882
So l became suspicious.

455
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:54,225
l was very suspicious
from then on.

456
00:34:54,225 --> 00:35:01,028
l had spent
that whole night drinking.

457
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:04,533
l drank all morning...
Then l got there.

458
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:08,427
When l got there,
it was normal.

459
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:11,141
She opened the door,
treated me fine.

460
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:13,878
Because on other days,
she shut the door,

461
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:16,039
she wouldn't let me come in.

462
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:19,340
So when l got there,
l told her,

463
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:23,046
''Don't tell yourfather
l'm here.''

464
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:27,191
Then she picked up the phone
and called herfather.

465
00:35:27,191 --> 00:35:29,056
And herfather called the cops.

466
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:32,396
Howis that for you?

467
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:36,059
Call the fucking police?
Why didn't he talk to me?

468
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:38,562
l hadn't killed her.

469
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:42,364
l wouldn't have done
anything bad with her.

470
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:46,268
That was when it hit me.

471
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:50,174
Man, to call the police?

472
00:35:54,218 --> 00:35:56,686
l got her like this

473
00:35:57,522 --> 00:36:00,821
and l hurt her a lot
with a knife.

474
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:06,025
She survived.

475
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:08,022
She's back to work.

476
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:10,227
And l felt very sick.

477
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:13,930
She sent me away.

478
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:18,836
l got one ofher clothes
because mine was all bloodied.

479
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:22,542
l really felt sick.

480
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:26,880
l fell on the sidewalk.
The sun was boiling hot.

481
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:30,348
The neighbors came
and threw cold water on me.

482
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:34,351
Their landlord came
and took me to the hospital.

483
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:41,154
Ever since we were together,
she said she didn't love me.

484
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:49,665
But that day there was a moment
when she said, ''l love you.''

485
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:55,513
l was trying to hit her,
on the bed,

486
00:36:55,513 --> 00:36:57,378
and the little girl showed up.

487
00:36:57,915 --> 00:37:00,551
That's when she managed
to push me with her feet.

488
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:03,714
She pushed me,
and l stood by the door.

489
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,217
She stood there at the sink.

490
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:15,123
She said, ''Oh, l love you.
Why are you doing this?''

491
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:19,534
Man, at that moment, l...

492
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:25,138
l threweverything up,
l threwthe knife.

493
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:28,138
l lost it.

494
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:35,846
l couldn't think of anything.

495
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,248
l was crazy.

496
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:41,754
lt was an impulse.
My emotions were on fire.

497
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:48,264
Angertoo.

498
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:56,671
There are a lot oflaws
to protect women.

499
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:59,510
l want a law
with my name on it.

500
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:01,808
Alawto protect men too.

501
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:09,847
One day, we were with a bunch
of people at a college party.

502
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:12,907
and when she got to the door,
she didn't want to come in.

503
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:15,353
l didn't want either.

504
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:18,856
So she decided to give me
a ride home,

505
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:23,761
and when she got to my home
l decided to kick it off.

506
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:27,128
l told her,
''Why don't we try it?''

507
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:32,625
And she said again that
we were friends and stuff.

508
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:38,230
And it was funny because
l told her to have a friend's kiss.

509
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,643
This story is great.

510
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:42,946
And so we kissed.

511
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:47,147
lt was amazing.
There was an awesome chemistry.

512
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:50,588
At the time,
my mother was out oftown,

513
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:56,254
so we locked ourselves in my room
until 4 p.m. the next day.

514
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:01,456
That year we decided
to spend New Year's together.

515
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:04,766
But she was going to Búzios,
with her family.

516
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:07,270
We decided to go as friends.

517
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:11,300
From the start, they weren't
receptive because of my piercings.

518
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:15,375
From the start, her family
wasn't very welcoming.

519
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:20,317
And her parents didn't like
us staying in her room for hours.

520
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:22,080
And we did.

521
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:27,725
lmagine the two of us
at her parent's beach house

522
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:30,489
locked in the room
until 3:30 p.m.

523
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:33,927
lt was a bit too much.

524
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:36,534
We were being
a little too obvious.

525
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:40,237
But come on,
we were too blind.

526
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:43,400
lt was this fascination,
all this desire.

527
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:50,948
l've never had that either.

528
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:53,508
Being so happy
with someone in bed.

529
00:40:54,952 --> 00:41:00,447
With her l discovered
newlevels of orgasm.

530
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:07,798
You know, female ejaculation,
stuffl'd never experienced.

531
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:11,666
So it was very strong.

532
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:15,506
But there was this controversy
in the house...

533
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:17,565
''Your friend isn't cool.''

534
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:21,576
So l called my mom
who was in Cabo Frio.

535
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:25,216
l asked herto come visit me

536
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:27,480
so people wouldn't think
l had no family.

537
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:31,786
So she brought me a box of Xanax,
because l had run out.

538
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:36,026
And this was normal.
For my family, it was fine.

539
00:41:36,026 --> 00:41:38,028
l'd been taking it
since l was 15.

540
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:40,997
So l left the thing
on the table,

541
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:45,135
her parents sawit
and were horrified.

542
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:50,505
They told Júlia, ''See, yourfriend
is crazy, she takes drugs.''

543
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:58,003
They had a fight
and l was watching it all.

544
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:02,545
But Júlia told them
l was her girlfriend.

545
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:07,691
l decided to wait outside
the house.

546
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:12,396
lt was December 31st,
the rain was pouring,

547
00:42:12,396 --> 00:42:16,560
l went to drink something
at a nearby beach kiosk.

548
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:19,060
Something awful happenned...

549
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:22,306
l was at the kiosk,

550
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:25,571
drinking and talking
with the guy selling drinks.

551
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:30,274
lt must have been around 6 p.m.
There was no one on the beach.

552
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:34,178
l was talking to this guy
and l felt the need to go pee.

553
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:37,681
So l went behind the kiosk.

554
00:42:38,622 --> 00:42:43,787
When l bent down, l sawhim coming
to fuck me from behind.

555
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:47,987
l pushed the guy and ran off
towards Júlia's house.

556
00:42:48,332 --> 00:42:53,497
But l tripped,
fell down and passed out.

557
00:42:54,138 --> 00:43:00,778
Then came her sister,
who was also very uptight,

558
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:02,980
l wasn't herfriend or anything.

559
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:07,246
She came and took me back
to her parents' place,

560
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:09,587
and you can imagine.

561
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:12,089
They already had
a lot of prejudice against us,

562
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:15,957
they sawme in this situation
and it only got worse.

563
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:19,851
Luckily, l had this old friend
living on the same street.

564
00:43:20,297 --> 00:43:23,266
Julia and her sister took me
to this girl's house.

565
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:26,563
l spent the night
at my friend's.

566
00:43:27,304 --> 00:43:30,808
But the next day
we packed ourthings,

567
00:43:30,808 --> 00:43:33,174
put it in the car
and went to Rio.

568
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:53,278
l gained about 90 pounds
during my relationship with her.

569
00:44:54,124 --> 00:44:56,727
That made me very insecure.

570
00:44:56,727 --> 00:45:00,720
l became very jealous,
very possessive.

571
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:06,032
So l developed a serious
self-esteem problem.

572
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:09,673
And besides beingjealous
and possessive,

573
00:45:09,673 --> 00:45:11,275
l started cheating on her.

574
00:45:11,275 --> 00:45:13,777
Not because l didn't want
to be with her,

575
00:45:13,777 --> 00:45:15,779
l did,
but l had to boost my ego,

576
00:45:15,779 --> 00:45:18,482
l felt the need
to be wanted.

577
00:45:18,482 --> 00:45:20,848
l wanted to have
hot girls desiring me.

578
00:45:21,285 --> 00:45:26,390
At the time,
it was my solution to...

579
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,950
boost my self-esteem.

580
00:45:29,793 --> 00:45:33,697
That created more stress,
more shouting, more fights.

581
00:45:33,697 --> 00:45:37,463
l cheated on her, felt guilty
and told her about it.

582
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:40,003
And she lost control,

583
00:45:40,003 --> 00:45:43,006
She started to hit me,
punch me

584
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:48,273
call me a bitch,
a real shouting.

585
00:45:48,812 --> 00:45:53,217
She realized the drug thing
was getting out of control for us.

586
00:45:53,217 --> 00:45:56,675
We decided to stop
snorting together.

587
00:45:57,321 --> 00:45:59,289
But she did it and l didn't.

588
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:01,492
We would go out,

589
00:46:01,492 --> 00:46:05,362
at a certain point
she'd leave and l'd stay.

590
00:46:05,362 --> 00:46:09,967
This gap brought on more drugs,
more cheating and stuff.

591
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:13,871
Once l got home at 6 p.m.
thinking it was 6 a.m.

592
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:18,375
l got home and she was
out of her mind, desperate,

593
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:21,478
aggressive, shouting,
''Where were you?!''

594
00:46:21,478 --> 00:46:26,383
l didn't knowwhere l was,
l was totally deranged.

595
00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:29,987
l came in and she was
punching me hard.

596
00:46:29,987 --> 00:46:34,792
l remember l went to bed
and lay down on my stomach,

597
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:38,195
covered my face and she
jumped on me hitting me.

598
00:46:38,195 --> 00:46:42,461
l just felt the pain...
in my back and my neck.

599
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:48,405
l felt l deserved those punches,
l felt she was right.

600
00:46:48,405 --> 00:46:51,670
ln that situation, ifl could
l would have helped her.

601
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:59,116
Then there was...
another situation.

602
00:46:59,116 --> 00:47:02,017
We were going through
a calmer phase.

603
00:47:03,353 --> 00:47:07,758
She decided
to invite some friends

604
00:47:07,758 --> 00:47:10,522
and have a party at home
to showthe apartment.

605
00:47:10,961 --> 00:47:14,624
And that day l woke up sick
with the runs.

606
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:19,269
But so far, so good.
These were her childhood friends.

607
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:22,072
But this girl
from college called,

608
00:47:22,072 --> 00:47:25,235
a girl l was sure
was into her.

609
00:47:25,576 --> 00:47:29,637
That was crazy because the girl
never showed any interest...

610
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:35,445
The girl called Julia
who then invited her over.

611
00:47:35,786 --> 00:47:41,692
l lost control. l felt awful.
l was totally enraged.

612
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:45,996
''Why did you call this girl
today when l'm feeling sick?''

613
00:47:45,996 --> 00:47:48,999
l picked up a glass
and threwit on the wall.

614
00:47:48,999 --> 00:47:50,801
You're having a party?

615
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:53,203
Let's see a party
without glasses!''

616
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:57,663
And l broke
every glass in the house.

617
00:47:58,508 --> 00:48:00,310
Then what happened?

618
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:02,946
All the girls showed up,

619
00:48:02,946 --> 00:48:06,650
l felt better, we went out,
bought some plastic cups,

620
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:09,052
had this huge party,

621
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:11,588
and there is this picture
of me with the girl,

622
00:48:11,588 --> 00:48:13,757
with my arm around her
during the party.

623
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:17,561
lt was such a crazy moment.

624
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:20,464
You didn't try to heal yourself
ofthat possessiveness?

625
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:24,668
She was also possessive.
She was very possessive.

626
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:27,971
She was less aggressive than me,
but she hit me too,

627
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:30,574
and she poisoned me
against everyone.

628
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:33,410
Especially against my mother,
my family.

629
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,279
Because she wanted me
just for her,

630
00:48:35,279 --> 00:48:40,584
that was her way
ofbeing possessive.

631
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:42,185
lt was a symptom
ofher possessiveness.

632
00:48:42,185 --> 00:48:44,288
She wanted me
all to herself.

633
00:48:44,288 --> 00:48:46,690
We each acted differently.

634
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:49,693
ln my possessiveness,
l would throwglasses.

635
00:48:49,693 --> 00:48:54,460
She poisoned me against everyone
and l let myselfbe poisoned.

636
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:58,802
Because when l started
to believe

637
00:48:58,802 --> 00:49:01,738
she was the only one
who really believed in me,

638
00:49:01,738 --> 00:49:04,206
l gave her words
absolute power.

639
00:49:04,841 --> 00:49:10,404
lt was an obsessive,
possessive relationship.

640
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:16,453
lt's very funny
because the sex,

641
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:19,556
right until the end,
it solved everything.

642
00:49:19,556 --> 00:49:21,558
And in the middle of everything,

643
00:49:21,558 --> 00:49:24,721
when we had sex,
everything was erased.

644
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:27,321
lt was like a compensation.

645
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:32,629
The crazy thing is our sex
also grewmore violent.

646
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:38,375
We enjoyed hitting each other
during sex,

647
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:42,334
scratching each other,
burning our backs with wax.

648
00:49:42,779 --> 00:49:46,738
But that was good.
That was pleasure.

649
00:49:47,784 --> 00:49:51,743
Usually when l got nervous,
l broke things.

650
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:56,157
But l won't say l never hit her,
because l did.

651
00:49:56,793 --> 00:49:58,795
Once l tore her clothes.

652
00:49:58,795 --> 00:50:02,253
Not the ones in the closet,
but those she was wearing.

653
00:50:02,899 --> 00:50:05,602
lt was as ifthis hitting
wasn't important,

654
00:50:05,602 --> 00:50:09,006
because we enjoyed so much
the good moments we still had.

655
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:12,909
But when you hit in anger,
did you feel like killing?

656
00:50:12,909 --> 00:50:16,913
No, it wasn't like that.
lt wasn't anger.

657
00:50:16,913 --> 00:50:18,315
We didn't want
to kill each other,

658
00:50:18,315 --> 00:50:20,875
it was a feeling
of misunderstanding.

659
00:50:21,418 --> 00:50:23,420
''l want to get along with you,

660
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:26,389
but you're not understanding
what l'm saying.''

661
00:50:26,923 --> 00:50:31,087
And so we did that
to come closertogether.

662
00:50:31,428 --> 00:50:33,430
Even when we fought,

663
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:36,695
we thought we'd spend
the rest of our lives together.

664
00:50:37,434 --> 00:50:42,599
We thought we'd go to Barcelona
to get really married.

665
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:46,443
Till one day she woke up early

666
00:50:46,443 --> 00:50:49,207
and l was screwing someone else
in the living room.

667
00:50:50,747 --> 00:50:54,351
But what really split us up
was this drug thing.

668
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:57,954
Because she was getting clean
and l got deeper into it.

669
00:50:57,954 --> 00:51:00,218
And l became
more and more promiscuous.

670
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:03,851
And she became disgusted with this
and we stopped having sex.

671
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:06,396
That's when our balance stopped.

672
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:10,200
l wanted to have sex with her,
but she couldn't do it with me.

673
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,169
lt hurt me so much,
l brought someone into our house.

674
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:17,164
So, of course,
she decided to leave.

675
00:51:18,008 --> 00:51:21,311
She said she wasn't
leaving for good

676
00:51:21,311 --> 00:51:23,313
but we needed
some time apart.

677
00:51:23,313 --> 00:51:25,679
Because we never split up.

678
00:51:26,016 --> 00:51:28,018
That day she said,
''l love you,

679
00:51:28,018 --> 00:51:31,922
we will be together,
l need some time alone.''

680
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:34,789
So l cut myself all over.

681
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:39,794
She came help me and l said,
''Go away, l don't need you!''

682
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:43,433
Then she called me at my mother's,
she talked to me,

683
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:46,236
said she liked me,
that we would be together,

684
00:51:46,236 --> 00:51:48,638
we'd never be apart...
But we were splitting up.

685
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:53,143
We didn't want to see it
because it was inconceivable,

686
00:51:53,143 --> 00:51:55,907
so we kept feeding this fantasy
that everything was fine.

687
00:51:56,546 --> 00:52:00,539
Till the day she started
seeing someone else.

688
00:52:00,884 --> 00:52:03,944
That was the end for me.
lt was over.

689
00:52:04,988 --> 00:52:12,596
Of all the relationships l had,
this was the most intense,

690
00:52:12,596 --> 00:52:17,701
and the most pleasurable,
also because l was very young...

691
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:20,403
When you discover
you love someone,

692
00:52:20,403 --> 00:52:23,106
you feel it's the most
important thing in the world.

693
00:52:23,106 --> 00:52:24,808
That it's never going
to happen again.

694
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:28,111
And truly, if l'm honest,
l can tell you,

695
00:52:28,111 --> 00:52:29,513
am l better off today?

696
00:52:29,513 --> 00:52:33,074
l am,
but it never happened again.

697
00:52:34,518 --> 00:52:36,884
And when you cut yourself,
what did you feel?

698
00:52:38,722 --> 00:52:41,486
l think it was a lot of things.

699
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:48,194
l felt guilty because l let
my life come to this point.

700
00:52:49,132 --> 00:52:50,734
l did this to myself.

701
00:52:50,734 --> 00:52:52,836
l ran out of money,
l got addicted,

702
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:54,437
my family didn't want me,

703
00:52:54,437 --> 00:52:57,702
l had no more friends around
when the relationship ended.

704
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:01,742
So it was also something
to punish myself.

705
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:07,083
And l wanted to showJulia,
''See what you did to me.''

706
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:10,187
lt's one thing
ifl say l'm suffering,

707
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:13,156
it's another
if you see blood everywhere.

708
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:15,187
lsn't it?

709
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:21,995
Also, when you have
something that hurts inside,

710
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:30,006
you can't put on a Band-Aid,
a salve, get stitches.

711
00:53:30,006 --> 00:53:31,701
There's nothing you can do.

712
00:53:32,008 --> 00:53:34,476
But on the outside you can,
so you...

713
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:37,578
Do you get it?

714
00:53:38,315 --> 00:53:41,113
lf you see one pain,
it softens the other.

715
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:44,120
But that's something
l only realized a short while ago.

716
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:48,325
You tried to manipulate her
by cutting yourself.

717
00:53:48,325 --> 00:53:49,622
Yeah.

718
00:53:50,527 --> 00:53:52,620
l learned to manipulate with her.

719
00:53:54,531 --> 00:53:55,896
She was good at that.

720
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:45,270
l was 14 then.
l lived at Leme,

721
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:50,278
l never had a boyfriend
and l met Fernando at a party.

722
00:55:51,414 --> 00:55:53,016
So it started.

723
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:56,383
Like every relationship
in this town, dancing and stuff.

724
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,484
He was very strong,
a body builder.

725
00:56:00,557 --> 00:56:03,460
At that time, l had
a very repressive upbringing.

726
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:07,419
l couldn't go to the movies,
go out at night.

727
00:56:07,964 --> 00:56:12,333
Fernando would pick me up
at school, we walked home.

728
00:56:14,971 --> 00:56:18,475
Actually, l learned
howto masturbate thanks to him,

729
00:56:18,475 --> 00:56:21,444
because he taught me
howit was done.

730
00:56:22,479 --> 00:56:24,447
But there was this detail.

731
00:56:25,081 --> 00:56:27,083
There was violence in my house

732
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:31,144
from my father
towards my brother and l.

733
00:56:32,188 --> 00:56:35,248
One day l was going
to a ballet class with my mom

734
00:56:35,592 --> 00:56:40,461
and this stranger in the street
asked her about my bruises.

735
00:56:41,798 --> 00:56:45,201
She said l had fallen,
got hurt,

736
00:56:45,201 --> 00:56:48,170
but l said my father
had hit me.

737
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:52,170
l told the truth
to that complete stranger.

738
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:56,413
And the fact
that l wasn't scared

739
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:59,871
is what made
my father lose control.

740
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:02,518
l actually think he...

741
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:07,757
he loved us a lot,
but that made things worse.

742
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:13,320
We couldn't separate the love
from the occasional violence.

743
00:57:17,367 --> 00:57:23,431
l think it's hard for a man
to be violent from the start.

744
00:57:23,973 --> 00:57:26,276
Violence is an insidious thing,

745
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:27,977
it appears little by little

746
00:57:27,977 --> 00:57:31,936
as the man realizes
he has power overthe woman.

747
00:57:32,882 --> 00:57:37,887
Or as he grows so insecure
that he getsjealous

748
00:57:37,887 --> 00:57:41,755
to the point of releasing
this latent violence...

749
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:46,752
We all have a latent violence.

750
00:57:48,198 --> 00:57:51,000
We're capable of doing
all sorts ofthings,

751
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,103
but we're educated,
civilized,

752
00:57:54,103 --> 00:57:56,571
and we learn to contain
our violence.

753
00:57:56,906 --> 00:58:02,208
And a sick, uncontrolled person
can't control that violence.

754
00:58:03,746 --> 00:58:07,910
Fernando started getting violent
because ofjealousy.

755
00:58:09,452 --> 00:58:10,817
l was a virgin

756
00:58:12,055 --> 00:58:15,821
and l stayed a virgin,
l didn't have sex with him.

757
00:58:16,759 --> 00:58:19,162
But despite being 14,

758
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:22,866
l was always very big, pretty.

759
00:58:22,866 --> 00:58:25,068
l used to draw
people's attention.

760
00:58:25,068 --> 00:58:31,074
That was a wound in his soul,
he couldn't take it.

761
00:58:31,074 --> 00:58:34,277
When he picked me up at school,
he had a lot of questions,

762
00:58:34,277 --> 00:58:36,579
Where did you go?
With whom?

763
00:58:36,579 --> 00:58:38,882
Anyone talked to you?
Anyone messed with you?

764
00:58:38,882 --> 00:58:40,645
Where are you going?

765
00:58:41,284 --> 00:58:43,752
l began to realize
he wasn't very normal.

766
00:58:44,587 --> 00:58:48,045
But when it becomes
a little too constant

767
00:58:48,491 --> 00:58:51,460
you're already in love.

768
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:55,562
So you can't tell
where the love ends

769
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:58,260
and where the violence starts.

770
00:58:58,902 --> 00:59:02,394
lsjealousy a sign oflove
or is it violence?

771
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:06,943
So when l said
l wasn't going to answer,

772
00:59:06,943 --> 00:59:10,902
he would pinch me,
grab my arm.

773
00:59:11,948 --> 00:59:14,651
When he sawhe was really
hurting me,

774
00:59:14,651 --> 00:59:18,610
he'd apologize
and say he wouldn't do it again.

775
00:59:19,956 --> 00:59:22,859
And l think that
at that time...

776
00:59:22,859 --> 00:59:25,562
l was beautiful, attractive,

777
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:28,929
and wouldn't put an end to it...

778
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:31,763
because of my family history.

779
00:59:32,268 --> 00:59:36,773
Because l was used to being
submitted to a relationship

780
00:59:36,773 --> 00:59:41,878
of power and aggression,
and love at the same time.

781
00:59:41,878 --> 00:59:44,981
So l thought it was normal
to a point,

782
00:59:44,981 --> 00:59:48,940
when l was pinched
or slapped.

783
00:59:49,686 --> 00:59:52,488
But when he started to
pull my hair real hard,

784
00:59:52,488 --> 00:59:54,591
and l had hair
down to my waist,

785
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:56,593
that really started to hurt.

786
00:59:56,593 --> 01:00:02,463
And l thought, ''lfl ever marry
this guy, he'll kill me.''

787
01:00:06,002 --> 01:00:09,904
But l insisted...
because it was good.

788
01:00:10,206 --> 01:00:11,901
lt felt nice.

789
01:00:12,809 --> 01:00:16,713
So you think that violence
was attractive to you,

790
01:00:16,713 --> 01:00:18,578
did you like it a bit?

791
01:00:21,017 --> 01:00:26,478
No, l don't think l thought
violence was attractive, but...

792
01:00:27,223 --> 01:00:29,325
The fact is my father hit me,

793
01:00:29,325 --> 01:00:35,889
so how could l interpret a slap,
a pinch as not liking?

794
01:00:38,835 --> 01:00:41,201
That, for me,
was part oflove.

795
01:00:42,338 --> 01:00:45,705
But l felt angry at myself
for not being able to break up.

796
01:00:48,845 --> 01:00:50,246
Then one day...

797
01:00:50,246 --> 01:00:53,215
One day something happened...

798
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:56,052
l was at the beach,

799
01:00:56,052 --> 01:00:59,756
l used to surfwith a T-shirt
so not to bruise my belly.

800
01:00:59,756 --> 01:01:02,054
l was at the beach
with some friends.

801
01:01:02,592 --> 01:01:06,896
l went in the water without
my board and swam real far.

802
01:01:06,896 --> 01:01:10,263
There l leaned on a friend's board
talking to him.

803
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:15,505
Fernando arrived
and they pointed me out.

804
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:19,008
When he saw
that from the sand,

805
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:21,811
me talking
with my friend on the board,

806
01:01:21,811 --> 01:01:23,972
he decided
to go into the water.

807
01:01:24,313 --> 01:01:27,517
He swam in my direction
and l swam towards him.

808
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:31,821
When l got close to him,
l sawhis face

809
01:01:31,821 --> 01:01:34,881
and he looked out of control.

810
01:01:35,725 --> 01:01:38,091
l talked normally with him.
''Hi, honey.''

811
01:01:39,128 --> 01:01:41,731
He looked at me
with great anger

812
01:01:41,731 --> 01:01:43,596
and pulled me under the water.

813
01:01:44,434 --> 01:01:47,801
You know, like kids
do on the beach.

814
01:01:48,237 --> 01:01:51,297
But he held me underthe water.

815
01:01:51,941 --> 01:01:54,808
l tried to surface
and l couldn't.

816
01:01:55,244 --> 01:01:57,747
l tried,
but l couldn't surface.

817
01:01:57,747 --> 01:01:59,806
My feet couldn't touch
the bottom.

818
01:02:00,149 --> 01:02:04,051
l became desperate.
l thought, ''l'm going to die here.''

819
01:02:05,688 --> 01:02:08,555
That was very clear to me.
l was going to die here.

820
01:02:09,492 --> 01:02:15,698
l started to cough up water
and he began to let me go.

821
01:02:15,698 --> 01:02:19,001
So l cried desperately.

822
01:02:19,001 --> 01:02:22,004
lt wasn't a cry of relief.

823
01:02:22,004 --> 01:02:24,165
lt was a cry of desperation.

824
01:02:24,607 --> 01:02:26,472
That was so crazy...

825
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:30,413
What's the line between
loving someone

826
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:32,074
and wanting to kill her?

827
01:02:32,615 --> 01:02:35,778
Maybe not wanting to kill,
but ending up killing.

828
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,922
Do you remember Eloá's story.

829
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:44,484
The guy went to the hospital
and asked how she was.

830
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:49,132
He shot her
in her head and groins,

831
01:02:49,132 --> 01:02:52,101
then he goes to the hospital
and asks how she is?

832
01:02:54,036 --> 01:02:57,173
l mean, was it premeditated?

833
01:02:57,173 --> 01:02:59,607
Did he want to kill me?

834
01:03:01,177 --> 01:03:04,280
l don't think so,
but something went out of control.

835
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:07,443
He forgot any kind of limit.

836
01:03:11,387 --> 01:03:18,156
l think that after that
l became a person with...

837
01:03:20,596 --> 01:03:22,962
with such a desire forfreedom.

838
01:03:23,699 --> 01:03:27,603
Because while l lived
with my parents,

839
01:03:27,603 --> 01:03:31,307
l lived in a prison.
l couldn't do anything.

840
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:34,710
The only thing that saved me
were the books.

841
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:38,271
l could live other stories,
live other lives...

842
01:03:39,015 --> 01:03:43,920
Actually, l think
the paternal violence was...

843
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:46,923
When l think of it,
the paternal violence was worse.

844
01:03:46,923 --> 01:03:51,292
There was a true
power struggle there.

845
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:57,834
lt changed when l decided
l was going to work,

846
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:00,530
l'd make my own money
and leave their house.

847
01:04:02,071 --> 01:04:04,539
An the violence changed...

848
01:04:05,374 --> 01:04:07,376
when l turned 18.

849
01:04:07,376 --> 01:04:11,180
My father came to slap me
in the face,

850
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:15,139
but l slapped him
and told him to go fuck himself.

851
01:04:17,386 --> 01:04:20,890
l told him
he was a son of a bitch.

852
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:23,192
l told him not to hit me,
that l was strong.

853
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:26,559
lf he hit me,
l'd hit him back.

854
01:04:29,899 --> 01:04:32,561
And he looked very surprised.

855
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:36,464
He didn't expect that from me.

856
01:04:41,811 --> 01:04:46,077
When l think of it,
violence is a loss of control.

857
01:04:46,816 --> 01:04:51,220
And the person who stays
in this kind of situation

858
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:54,485
isjust as sick
as the person who hits.

859
01:04:55,324 --> 01:04:57,226
Orthey're masochists.

860
01:04:57,226 --> 01:04:59,888
Because the masochist
doesn't exist.

861
01:05:00,363 --> 01:05:04,026
The sadist and the masochist
depend on each other.

862
01:05:04,967 --> 01:05:09,672
That was my situation,
but l changed in my favor.

863
01:05:09,672 --> 01:05:13,976
My brother always hit his kids

864
01:05:13,976 --> 01:05:16,879
and he thought
it was good for them.

865
01:05:16,879 --> 01:05:19,143
And so did his wife.

866
01:05:19,882 --> 01:05:21,984
They also hit each other

867
01:05:21,984 --> 01:05:25,647
and had a very violent
family situation.

868
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:31,253
l think violence
is a loss of control.

869
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:37,199
l sawthat in myself
when l lost control.

870
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:39,101
l had a son.

871
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:41,763
l would lose control
and spank him a bit.

872
01:05:42,405 --> 01:05:44,566
But then l thought...

873
01:05:45,908 --> 01:05:48,274
''My God, l'm turning
into my father.

874
01:05:52,214 --> 01:05:54,182
l can't turn into my father.''

875
01:05:55,918 --> 01:06:02,158
So when my son had 3 years old,
l looked at him and said,

876
01:06:02,158 --> 01:06:07,721
''Look, Mommy is never
going to spank you or pinch you.

877
01:06:09,365 --> 01:06:11,333
But l'll give you a time out.''

878
01:06:14,070 --> 01:06:17,130
That was a relief for me.

879
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:24,037
lt was a huge relief. Huge.

880
01:06:31,587 --> 01:06:34,249
You never had
another violent relationship?

881
01:06:35,691 --> 01:06:37,056
No, never again.

882
01:06:37,793 --> 01:06:38,851
Never again.

883
01:06:39,595 --> 01:06:41,597
Never again, l decided.

884
01:06:41,597 --> 01:06:47,160
l would never let another man
lay a finger on me.

885
01:06:48,304 --> 01:06:50,606
l would never again
date someonejealous,

886
01:06:50,606 --> 01:06:54,098
and l would never
be hit again.

887
01:06:55,611 --> 01:06:59,479
And l neverfound anyone
like that again.

888
01:07:00,549 --> 01:07:02,251
l didn't want to find them,

889
01:07:02,251 --> 01:07:05,709
because there are
lots ofthem out there.

890
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:10,459
l was really lucky
l didn't die at 16,

891
01:07:10,459 --> 01:07:14,623
but a lot of women
become addicted to that.

892
01:07:18,567 --> 01:07:24,335
So l think l turned
my story around in my favor.

893
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:22,364
First we need to understand
what it is to love.

894
01:08:22,364 --> 01:08:25,501
lf you told me, ''two people
who depend on one another,''

895
01:08:25,501 --> 01:08:28,334
it'd have been easier
than ''two people in love.''

896
01:08:28,971 --> 01:08:31,674
The love relationship
is a permanent act of piracy,

897
01:08:31,674 --> 01:08:34,541
where you take from the other
what you lack.

898
01:08:34,877 --> 01:08:39,143
lt's combat where
the sweat oflove can be...

899
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:45,187
the excretion ofhate
one has forthe other,

900
01:08:45,187 --> 01:08:48,491
for not having
all the things the other has.

901
01:08:48,491 --> 01:08:50,726
And since this possession
is precarious,

902
01:08:50,726 --> 01:08:53,095
l love and l am
desperate for love.

903
01:08:53,095 --> 01:08:55,097
That through
a survival instinct,

904
01:08:55,097 --> 01:08:57,800
because my instinct tells me
l need to have a child with her,

905
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,768
because that will beget me
strong children.

906
01:09:01,337 --> 01:09:03,703
Or because l'm incapable
ofliving alone...

907
01:09:05,941 --> 01:09:07,943
Or because ofthe need
to transform the other

908
01:09:07,943 --> 01:09:10,446
into a representation
of my success,

909
01:09:10,446 --> 01:09:12,848
or a public exhibition
of my conquest.

910
01:09:12,848 --> 01:09:15,651
Or yet to have
the beauty, intelligence,

911
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:20,611
sensitivity, or any other quality
the other has and l need.

912
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:25,361
We hang onto each other,

913
01:09:25,361 --> 01:09:28,464
deluding we can take
what the other has,

914
01:09:28,464 --> 01:09:30,932
in a vampire like manner.
lt's a cannibalistic thing.

915
01:09:33,068 --> 01:09:35,730
l happened to reach my limit
a fewtimes.

916
01:09:37,373 --> 01:09:40,276
When managing
thejealousy for a woman,

917
01:09:40,276 --> 01:09:43,579
if she's a free spirit,
you'll suffer a lot.

918
01:09:43,579 --> 01:09:45,137
You have no idea.

919
01:09:45,481 --> 01:09:48,245
You have no idea what it's like
to be manipulated.

920
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:50,586
Your hormones won't leave
you alone.

921
01:09:50,586 --> 01:09:53,589
Your balls are producing spunk
that has to be ejected

922
01:09:53,589 --> 01:09:57,993
and because the warmth
and wetness ofthat cunt

923
01:09:57,993 --> 01:10:01,797
which has a certain smell,
a certain feeling,

924
01:10:01,797 --> 01:10:06,063
makes you feel
like you're invulnerable.

925
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:09,905
l had a girlfriend...

926
01:10:09,905 --> 01:10:14,069
And l only realized howmuch
l loved her after we broke up.

927
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:16,674
Then l had lunch with her,
it was awful.

928
01:10:17,413 --> 01:10:19,574
We were trying to have
a hard conversation.

929
01:10:19,915 --> 01:10:23,619
This guy went by,
a good-looking guy l knew.

930
01:10:23,619 --> 01:10:25,754
When he sawme talking
to this beautiful woman,

931
01:10:25,754 --> 01:10:27,984
he looked at me
and kind of greated me.

932
01:10:28,724 --> 01:10:33,028
Moments later l sawwhen
she looked at him thinking,

933
01:10:33,028 --> 01:10:35,130
''l think l'd suck
this guy's dick.''

934
01:10:35,130 --> 01:10:36,791
l sawthat in her.

935
01:10:37,633 --> 01:10:42,738
That left me in a state
l thought l had overcome,

936
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:45,474
that thing ofthe argument,

937
01:10:45,474 --> 01:10:47,843
the misunderstanding,
the melee combat.

938
01:10:47,843 --> 01:10:49,545
l thought l were Zen

939
01:10:49,545 --> 01:10:52,948
and l could generously allowher
to live without guilt.

940
01:10:52,948 --> 01:10:55,712
''Let's live without guilt.
Me too, for fuck's sake.''

941
01:10:56,452 --> 01:10:57,853
lt was so beautiful.

942
01:10:57,853 --> 01:11:00,219
Remember when we were
at that beach hotel?

943
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:06,050
After we fucked l looked up
and said, ''Fuck, what happened?

944
01:11:06,395 --> 01:11:09,762
Did the sky change?
Did l turn into Van Gogh?''

945
01:11:10,299 --> 01:11:12,893
There were
such lights and colors.

946
01:11:16,205 --> 01:11:18,107
''What's happening to me?''

947
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:19,608
And l hear her saying
in my ear,

948
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:21,667
''This is love.
This is love...''

949
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:27,481
Then suddenly we stab each other,
metaphorically speaking.

950
01:11:28,517 --> 01:11:31,420
But my words were as a saw,

951
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:34,023
cutting offlegs, arms,

952
01:11:34,023 --> 01:11:35,824
sticking my pen knife
in herthroat

953
01:11:35,824 --> 01:11:37,826
so it would gush blood
from her neck.

954
01:11:37,826 --> 01:11:41,130
How can you go
from an unbelievable ecstasy

955
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:43,690
to a situation in which
you are a normal person?

956
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:47,036
Where does that brainstorm go?

957
01:11:47,036 --> 01:11:48,697
The nerves trembling?

958
01:11:49,238 --> 01:11:51,297
That sense of peace
and completeness.

959
01:11:52,041 --> 01:11:54,543
How can l allowanother person
to come like that

960
01:11:54,543 --> 01:11:57,307
with the woman who gave me
this unbelievable compensation?

961
01:11:57,946 --> 01:12:00,249
How can l accept that?

962
01:12:00,249 --> 01:12:01,984
Because while she says,
''l love you'',

963
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:05,647
it means ''l love you,
l give you all l am, all l have.''

964
01:12:06,689 --> 01:12:08,290
Then it's taken from you.

965
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:10,492
How can l go on living
after that?

966
01:12:10,492 --> 01:12:12,687
How can l accept it
without violence?

967
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:16,198
And this violence of yours

968
01:12:16,198 --> 01:12:19,759
is the manifestation
of yourfear oflosing...

969
01:12:20,202 --> 01:12:21,863
oflosing what makes you happy.

970
01:12:23,205 --> 01:12:25,799
Actually, the fear oflosing
what makes you unhappy.

971
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:28,374
There is a masochism imbued
in all this violence.

972
01:12:29,611 --> 01:12:32,580
And the question is:
why continue the friction?

973
01:12:33,115 --> 01:12:35,379
Why continue with this
love-hate relationship?

974
01:12:36,819 --> 01:12:38,520
Why think
it's the last person,

975
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:40,856
when there are
three orfour women

976
01:12:40,856 --> 01:12:43,017
on this street
you can get along with?

977
01:12:44,126 --> 01:12:45,593
Why?

978
01:12:46,128 --> 01:12:48,030
Why this permanent
repeating of a thing

979
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:50,498
that makes you unhappy,
that brings you anguish?

980
01:12:51,233 --> 01:12:54,725
ln the psychotherapeutic world,
they call this masochism.

981
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:58,741
But there are other words
to describe this and the best are:

982
01:12:58,741 --> 01:13:02,040
''cowardice to confront
your fragility,''

983
01:13:02,578 --> 01:13:04,239
your fear ofbeing alone.

984
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:08,843
What about the other side,
women's violence against you?

985
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:10,750
lt's the female game,

986
01:13:11,286 --> 01:13:13,686
the female silence that despises.

987
01:13:15,190 --> 01:13:17,893
l think women knowhowto hurt
more than men.

988
01:13:17,893 --> 01:13:20,157
Women have a natural gift
for hurting.

989
01:13:23,198 --> 01:13:24,800
Men can hit.

990
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:29,760
But women are more intelligent,
more subtle than men.

991
01:13:30,105 --> 01:13:32,164
We live in loneliness,

992
01:13:32,508 --> 01:13:35,210
we have to pay a therapist
to talk to someone.

993
01:13:35,210 --> 01:13:37,872
''Doctor, l think l'm queer,
but l'm not sure.''

994
01:13:38,213 --> 01:13:40,181
They talk about everything,

995
01:13:40,516 --> 01:13:42,718
look howmany magazines
there are about that.

996
01:13:42,718 --> 01:13:46,984
All kinds of psychological,
emotional subjects,

997
01:13:47,823 --> 01:13:50,189
all the TV shows they have.

998
01:13:51,026 --> 01:13:54,129
They talk, we live in solitude,
we talk when we drink.

999
01:13:54,129 --> 01:13:56,632
Talk what? With whom?

1000
01:13:56,632 --> 01:13:58,497
Who are we going to expose
our machoness to?

1001
01:14:01,570 --> 01:14:05,073
The great philosopher oflove
was Nelson Rodrigues...

1002
01:14:05,073 --> 01:14:07,439
''Forgive me
for betraying me.''

1003
01:14:09,378 --> 01:14:11,680
l think that's the basic phrase

1004
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:15,138
over which all other speculations
about love take place.

1005
01:14:15,484 --> 01:14:18,187
You give me a cause,
you create the reason

1006
01:14:18,187 --> 01:14:21,247
and you hate yourself for being
the cause of what you destroyed.

1007
01:14:22,191 --> 01:14:25,251
But you don't know
if you really wanted to destroy it.

1008
01:14:26,995 --> 01:14:30,199
There is a masochism imbedded
in all this violence.

1009
01:14:30,199 --> 01:14:34,903
ln my case, whenever
there were fights, jealousy,

1010
01:14:34,903 --> 01:14:37,506
the melee combat,
the misunderstanding,

1011
01:14:37,506 --> 01:14:40,809
there was always a reason.

1012
01:14:40,809 --> 01:14:43,573
But l was always
the one to blame.

1013
01:14:45,214 --> 01:14:46,615
ln my last relationship,
for example,

1014
01:14:46,615 --> 01:14:48,173
a very complicated relationship.

1015
01:14:49,017 --> 01:14:52,721
During a fight, l told her,

1016
01:14:52,721 --> 01:14:55,781
''Let's take some time out.''
Overthe phone.

1017
01:14:56,225 --> 01:14:58,489
l punished her not talking
to herfor 15 days.

1018
01:14:59,228 --> 01:15:00,923
A punishment, ironically.

1019
01:15:01,563 --> 01:15:04,123
When l showed up,
she had another guy.

1020
01:15:07,169 --> 01:15:13,130
We went to a restaurant, she said,
''Let's get back together?''

1021
01:15:14,376 --> 01:15:16,378
l say, ''You're the woman
l love the most,

1022
01:15:16,378 --> 01:15:18,080
the woman l want the most.

1023
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:21,277
But today l couldn't fuck you
even with three condoms.

1024
01:15:21,683 --> 01:15:23,785
Just to imagine some guy
fucking your asshole

1025
01:15:23,785 --> 01:15:26,788
and licking your cunt,
that makes me sick.

1026
01:15:26,788 --> 01:15:29,757
Go away. Get out of my life
because it's not going to work.

1027
01:15:32,094 --> 01:15:34,460
Love... a lot of love.

1028
01:15:36,098 --> 01:15:38,566
No, not love.
A lot of unresolved passion.

1029
01:15:39,601 --> 01:15:43,059
She wanted to get back together
during that lunch.

1030
01:15:43,305 --> 01:15:47,969
l asked her, ''When you fuck
this guy, what do you think?''

1031
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:50,974
''Ninety percent of the time
l think of you.''

1032
01:15:53,615 --> 01:15:55,776
God, that's cruel.

1033
01:15:56,818 --> 01:15:59,121
How stupid of me
to have asked.

1034
01:15:59,121 --> 01:16:01,021
Her nerve to have answered.

1035
01:16:07,362 --> 01:16:09,125
You want to knowhowit was?

1036
01:16:09,765 --> 01:16:13,869
lt was with another girlfriend,
it's been a while.

1037
01:16:13,869 --> 01:16:16,235
She'd already cheated on me
a fewtimes.

1038
01:16:16,672 --> 01:16:18,173
She traveled to New York
for 15 days,

1039
01:16:18,173 --> 01:16:20,539
when she comes back,
she gives me the clap.

1040
01:16:21,076 --> 01:16:25,280
l went nuts. l broke everything,
the fridge, the TV,

1041
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:26,838
l tore the clothes in the closet.

1042
01:16:27,482 --> 01:16:30,786
l hit her real hard.
l hit her with an open hand.

1043
01:16:30,786 --> 01:16:32,845
l'd kill her with my fist.

1044
01:16:33,689 --> 01:16:35,748
Her eye retina tore off.

1045
01:16:36,992 --> 01:16:38,357
l took my pen knife.

1046
01:16:38,894 --> 01:16:41,997
Suddenly, when l looked up,
there was blood everywhere.

1047
01:16:41,997 --> 01:16:44,363
There was blood
on the ceiling moldings.

1048
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:48,558
When l looked,
my finger was cut, almost cut off.

1049
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:52,007
l went to a friend's house
and she took me to the hospital.

1050
01:16:52,007 --> 01:16:53,668
When l came back,
she wasn't there.

1051
01:16:54,109 --> 01:16:56,712
l got my .357,
got into my car.

1052
01:16:56,712 --> 01:16:58,313
l had an Audi at the time,

1053
01:16:58,313 --> 01:17:00,907
and searched for her
in bars, restaurants.

1054
01:17:01,249 --> 01:17:05,117
l don't drink, but that night
l had four whiskeys in one bar.

1055
01:17:06,254 --> 01:17:08,017
l came back home
and she was there.

1056
01:17:08,757 --> 01:17:10,918
l stuck the .357 in her mouth.

1057
01:17:13,261 --> 01:17:16,264
l cocked it, put my finger
on the trigger.

1058
01:17:16,264 --> 01:17:17,666
lt was like l said,

1059
01:17:17,666 --> 01:17:21,033
the blood pulsating in the neck,
the heart, the neck.

1060
01:17:26,775 --> 01:17:29,642
l didn't shoot.
l don't knowwhat stopped me.

1061
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:32,942
She left.

1062
01:18:46,388 --> 01:18:47,548
lt was like this.

1063
01:18:48,190 --> 01:18:53,253
l fell for him
because he was the opposite of me.

1064
01:18:54,196 --> 01:18:59,463
l sawin him the chance ofhaving
this experience that wasn't mine,

1065
01:19:00,335 --> 01:19:02,098
of wanting this experience.

1066
01:19:02,437 --> 01:19:06,641
l was fascinated by all the stories
of the years of repression,

1067
01:19:06,641 --> 01:19:08,700
the resistance to the dictatorship.

1068
01:19:09,344 --> 01:19:12,211
But it was his story, not mine.

1069
01:19:13,348 --> 01:19:15,908
Well, when l met him,
l was married,

1070
01:19:17,052 --> 01:19:22,012
l fell in love and in a week
l packed my bags and left.

1071
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:24,860
And l left for life,

1072
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:28,163
because l had a thirst for life,

1073
01:19:28,163 --> 01:19:30,222
l wanted to leave that life,

1074
01:19:30,866 --> 01:19:32,768
l was opening myself
to a newworld,

1075
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:36,135
l was living a dream with him.

1076
01:19:38,373 --> 01:19:43,078
The first big surprise
happened at a barbecue

1077
01:19:43,078 --> 01:19:45,444
opening our house
for his friends.

1078
01:19:46,381 --> 01:19:49,885
Because this kind of person
has a personality

1079
01:19:49,885 --> 01:19:53,688
that starts hampering
everything that is your world,

1080
01:19:53,688 --> 01:19:57,886
everything that's good foryou,
restricting your world to his.

1081
01:19:58,593 --> 01:20:01,858
So we were there
with his friends,

1082
01:20:02,397 --> 01:20:04,299
he had a fewbeers too many

1083
01:20:04,299 --> 01:20:09,965
and he had a violence outburst
towards me, out ofthe blue.

1084
01:20:10,605 --> 01:20:14,871
l was very surprised
because it was the first time...

1085
01:20:15,610 --> 01:20:18,078
lt was my first contact
with that.

1086
01:20:22,717 --> 01:20:24,920
But l'm guilty.

1087
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:29,186
You put yourselfin a position
of humiliation and you stay.

1088
01:20:29,724 --> 01:20:32,327
l was humiliated several times
in front of other people.

1089
01:20:32,327 --> 01:20:33,692
Several times.

1090
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:37,196
There was this time
at home once...

1091
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:39,935
This friend ofhis, Roberto,

1092
01:20:39,935 --> 01:20:42,037
they were trying
to set up a company,

1093
01:20:42,037 --> 01:20:43,638
this project together,

1094
01:20:43,638 --> 01:20:46,741
there was a third person
and it was a dinner.

1095
01:20:46,741 --> 01:20:49,144
We were talking,
l don't knowwhat,

1096
01:20:49,144 --> 01:20:51,847
and something was said
about this person, a woman,

1097
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:54,611
and l criticized that woman.

1098
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:59,254
That provoked
such a fury against me.

1099
01:20:59,254 --> 01:21:01,990
He started to scream,
attacking me,

1100
01:21:01,990 --> 01:21:04,292
asking who was l
to criticize that woman?

1101
01:21:04,292 --> 01:21:06,695
l was an imbecile,
a little shit,

1102
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:08,856
and all these awful things
against me.

1103
01:21:09,698 --> 01:21:13,101
And l don't really remember
what he said to me,

1104
01:21:13,101 --> 01:21:17,305
but they were things
to meant to diminish me.

1105
01:21:17,305 --> 01:21:21,509
l remember l got up to leave

1106
01:21:21,509 --> 01:21:23,773
and he said,
''Yeah, go ahead, leave!''

1107
01:21:24,312 --> 01:21:27,115
Did l go? You think?
Not at all.

1108
01:21:27,115 --> 01:21:30,380
l went for a walk around the block
because l couldn't leave.

1109
01:21:31,119 --> 01:21:35,988
Then l came back,
sat and kept quiet.

1110
01:21:37,626 --> 01:21:39,890
Do you knowwhy
you couldn't leave?

1111
01:21:44,332 --> 01:21:46,034
l liked him.

1112
01:21:46,034 --> 01:21:47,797
l really liked him.

1113
01:21:49,237 --> 01:21:52,900
At that time, l think l felt
l couldn't live without him.

1114
01:21:54,142 --> 01:21:58,704
That's where the psychological
dependence comes in.

1115
01:22:00,382 --> 01:22:05,445
Because he realizes he has
control and domination.

1116
01:22:06,187 --> 01:22:08,553
He had control
and domination over me.

1117
01:22:10,091 --> 01:22:12,355
And my life became
a living hell.

1118
01:22:13,295 --> 01:22:21,002
You have to wonder if what you'll do
will botherthe other,

1119
01:22:21,002 --> 01:22:24,961
and awaken the beast
that lurks inside him.

1120
01:22:25,507 --> 01:22:29,711
So one day l went to buy aspirin
at the drug store.

1121
01:22:29,711 --> 01:22:31,913
l got out ofthe car
and left the door open.

1122
01:22:31,913 --> 01:22:37,519
Leaving the door open
created this 24 hour crisis,

1123
01:22:37,519 --> 01:22:39,783
the guy just kept
screaming at me.

1124
01:22:40,722 --> 01:22:42,524
My life became like that.

1125
01:22:42,524 --> 01:22:47,689
You don't knowhow
to avoid the problems.

1126
01:22:49,531 --> 01:22:51,795
And you never had the courage
to do anything?

1127
01:22:57,339 --> 01:23:01,332
Life was moving on.

1128
01:23:02,978 --> 01:23:05,380
Then he started to...

1129
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:08,645
he wouldn't showup
one day, three days...

1130
01:23:09,484 --> 01:23:12,787
and you sort of...
Life became...

1131
01:23:12,787 --> 01:23:14,846
l moved on with my life.

1132
01:23:15,890 --> 01:23:19,553
At that time, l had an affair
with a friend ofhis.

1133
01:23:21,696 --> 01:23:28,503
One day l came home
after being with his friend

1134
01:23:28,503 --> 01:23:31,063
and l told him
l sawthat friend.

1135
01:23:32,207 --> 01:23:36,411
l didn't go into details,
because it was normal,

1136
01:23:36,411 --> 01:23:39,714
we would get together,
like friends.

1137
01:23:39,714 --> 01:23:44,981
We argued a bit about it
and then we went to bed.

1138
01:23:45,620 --> 01:23:48,023
At that time l was
creating a discotheque,

1139
01:23:48,023 --> 01:23:52,127
arranging his records
in a super cool shelfl made.

1140
01:23:52,127 --> 01:23:55,330
lt was coming out very nice.

1141
01:23:55,330 --> 01:23:57,389
And l called him
to the room to come see.

1142
01:23:58,133 --> 01:24:02,771
And then he came like a beast,
covering me with blows,

1143
01:24:02,771 --> 01:24:04,932
because ofthe story
with the friend.

1144
01:24:05,273 --> 01:24:09,978
And he kept hitting me,
pinning me against the floor,

1145
01:24:09,978 --> 01:24:14,115
covering me with blows,
l obviously became scared,

1146
01:24:14,115 --> 01:24:15,784
l tried to get out of that,

1147
01:24:15,784 --> 01:24:19,888
l managed to escape,
and l ran to the door,

1148
01:24:19,888 --> 01:24:23,291
in my socks, without shoes,
it was raining like crazy outside.

1149
01:24:23,291 --> 01:24:26,194
l run out the door
in the pouring rain like crazy,

1150
01:24:26,194 --> 01:24:28,096
afraid that
he might come after me.

1151
01:24:28,096 --> 01:24:30,799
And he runs to the door
and yells,

1152
01:24:30,799 --> 01:24:32,960
''Run, you little bourgeoisie shit.''

1153
01:24:35,203 --> 01:24:38,172
Suddenly all the differences
come up.

1154
01:24:39,207 --> 01:24:41,971
''You little bourgeoisie shit.''
and all that.

1155
01:24:43,711 --> 01:24:48,580
And the little bourgeoisie shit
sought refuge with her sister.

1156
01:24:49,617 --> 01:24:53,883
On that day, he tore my clothes
and burnt them.

1157
01:24:55,723 --> 01:24:57,281
Real crazy, right?

1158
01:24:59,027 --> 01:25:04,866
This friend of ours set up
this meeting between us

1159
01:25:04,866 --> 01:25:06,527
at a public place.

1160
01:25:09,571 --> 01:25:11,038
lt was a...

1161
01:25:11,573 --> 01:25:13,575
Was it a reconcilement court?

1162
01:25:13,575 --> 01:25:18,740
No. lt wasn't a family court.
But it was a public place.

1163
01:25:19,681 --> 01:25:23,947
We were there at this restaurant,
everyone there,

1164
01:25:24,686 --> 01:25:29,791
and to everyone's surprise
instead of split up,

1165
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:32,157
the idiot here
goes back to the guy.

1166
01:25:37,699 --> 01:25:42,103
He took my hand,

1167
01:25:42,103 --> 01:25:44,205
looked at me with tears
in his eyes and said,

1168
01:25:44,205 --> 01:25:47,971
''This will never happen again.
lt will never happen again.''

1169
01:25:50,411 --> 01:25:58,920
This kind of relationship
destroys our self-esteem.

1170
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:03,323
l think it's a process.

1171
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:08,763
l don't knowif the other one
is conscious of what he does,

1172
01:26:08,763 --> 01:26:14,969
but he keeps on
crippling your life

1173
01:26:14,969 --> 01:26:19,073
and making you believe you're shit,
you don't exist,

1174
01:26:19,073 --> 01:26:22,440
your self-esteem doesn't exist.

1175
01:26:24,379 --> 01:26:27,746
So you become a non-being
next to this person.

1176
01:26:31,586 --> 01:26:33,747
Where's the good side
ofthis story?

1177
01:26:34,289 --> 01:26:35,950
The good side ofthe story...

1178
01:26:36,991 --> 01:26:40,695
There's something l didn't tell,

1179
01:26:40,695 --> 01:26:44,461
l guess l jumped over that part,
l don't knowwhy.

1180
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:49,766
One day, he took me
to a friend's home.

1181
01:26:51,306 --> 01:26:53,467
And he introduced me to cocaine,

1182
01:26:54,108 --> 01:26:56,576
which wasn't well known
at the time.

1183
01:26:57,212 --> 01:27:00,014
l'd never had cocaine.

1184
01:27:00,014 --> 01:27:03,108
lt was a marvelous night,
l loved that thing.

1185
01:27:04,052 --> 01:27:08,056
lt was something else.
And l was...

1186
01:27:08,056 --> 01:27:13,061
He traveled, and
l who had loved that thing,

1187
01:27:13,061 --> 01:27:15,263
but had no idea,

1188
01:27:15,263 --> 01:27:20,068
decided to call his friend
to buy a rock and surprise him.

1189
01:27:20,068 --> 01:27:23,371
When he came back
and sawthat,

1190
01:27:23,371 --> 01:27:25,873
he was surprised,
he said, ''Wow" .

1191
01:27:25,873 --> 01:27:27,775
He couldn't believe it.

1192
01:27:27,775 --> 01:27:32,380
lt wasn't in his universe of
possibilities that l could do that.

1193
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:34,282
And the rock
turned into a party,

1194
01:27:34,282 --> 01:27:36,884
because we snorted,
and snorted.

1195
01:27:36,884 --> 01:27:39,087
Why did l tell you that?

1196
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:47,095
Oh yeah, because l quickly realized
that if anything happened,

1197
01:27:47,095 --> 01:27:50,098
a fight, an argument,
a bad mood,

1198
01:27:50,098 --> 01:27:52,760
l would go and buy coke.

1199
01:27:53,201 --> 01:27:56,364
l knewthat when we snorted
together, we got along.

1200
01:27:57,905 --> 01:28:02,001
And we snorted a lot.
We had huge trips...

1201
01:28:03,144 --> 01:28:05,704
Once when we snorted...

1202
01:28:06,848 --> 01:28:08,406
Anyway...

1203
01:28:09,150 --> 01:28:12,017
Once we had sex
for eight hours straight.

1204
01:28:12,854 --> 01:28:15,556
And you'll make me
the classic question.

1205
01:28:15,556 --> 01:28:17,922
Doesn't the dick go soft?

1206
01:28:18,459 --> 01:28:20,762
lt does,
but that's not a problem.

1207
01:28:20,762 --> 01:28:23,629
Because it's all in the head,
the pleasure is in the head.

1208
01:28:24,766 --> 01:28:27,769
We had great trips,

1209
01:28:27,769 --> 01:28:30,932
amazing moments
made eternal by the coke.

1210
01:28:33,274 --> 01:28:36,141
There are times...

1211
01:28:36,978 --> 01:28:40,081
when you have
a fraction of clarity.

1212
01:28:40,081 --> 01:28:44,385
l think my fraction of clarity
came during a New Year's eve

1213
01:28:44,385 --> 01:28:47,548
l spent by myself.
All by myself.

1214
01:28:48,089 --> 01:28:52,093
He came the next day,
about six in the morning,

1215
01:28:52,093 --> 01:28:54,796
grabbed some coffee,
sat on the bed

1216
01:28:54,796 --> 01:28:58,800
and said he didn't come
because he was with another woman

1217
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:01,598
and he was torn between
the other woman and me.

1218
01:29:03,438 --> 01:29:07,542
That for me was the end.

1219
01:29:07,542 --> 01:29:10,745
So l said, ''Look, l've put up
with everything,

1220
01:29:10,745 --> 01:29:12,947
but l'm not putting up
with that.

1221
01:29:12,947 --> 01:29:15,750
l want you to leave.
So get yourthings and leave.''

1222
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:17,051
He didn't want to got.

1223
01:29:17,051 --> 01:29:20,316
He wanted to live both things
and then decide.

1224
01:29:21,556 --> 01:29:24,859
That was the limit of my limit.

1225
01:29:24,859 --> 01:29:27,327
l wasn't going to take that.

1226
01:29:29,263 --> 01:29:30,865
But then there was...

1227
01:29:30,865 --> 01:29:35,069
At the time, there was
another majorfactor.

1228
01:29:35,069 --> 01:29:37,435
We already had a son together.

1229
01:29:38,373 --> 01:29:40,739
l had a child at a time
when l was addicted.

1230
01:29:41,576 --> 01:29:43,678
But l was a normal person,

1231
01:29:43,678 --> 01:29:45,737
l worked,
l had a lot of work even.

1232
01:29:46,981 --> 01:29:49,984
When l became pregnant,
l stopped snorting,

1233
01:29:49,984 --> 01:29:51,886
l manage to stop doing coke.

1234
01:29:51,886 --> 01:29:54,252
But then l took it up again
soon after.

1235
01:29:55,189 --> 01:29:58,092
My daughter must have been
a fewmonths old.

1236
01:29:58,092 --> 01:30:00,856
She was always in her crib.

1237
01:30:02,697 --> 01:30:06,901
And there was this night
when we snorted quite a lot.

1238
01:30:06,901 --> 01:30:12,362
lt was a party, we snorted a lot,
l did too much and passed out.

1239
01:30:12,807 --> 01:30:16,766
l passed out in a strange way.

1240
01:30:17,912 --> 01:30:24,519
l couldn't move,
l couldn't see, l couldn't...

1241
01:30:24,519 --> 01:30:29,924
But l could hear, and l heard him
calling the emergency.

1242
01:30:29,924 --> 01:30:31,926
The ambulance was coming.

1243
01:30:31,926 --> 01:30:36,631
We lived in an alley at the time.
lt was hard to get in.

1244
01:30:36,631 --> 01:30:38,633
l heard the car,
it was the middle ofthe night,

1245
01:30:38,633 --> 01:30:41,035
the ambulance couldn't get in.

1246
01:30:41,035 --> 01:30:43,037
They were trying to get closer.

1247
01:30:43,037 --> 01:30:48,543
And two thoughts
ran through my head.

1248
01:30:48,543 --> 01:30:54,413
''l'm not going to die because
l'm not seeing my life go by.''

1249
01:30:55,450 --> 01:30:59,716
And another thing l thought
before passing out was...

1250
01:31:01,789 --> 01:31:03,991
''They'll take me
to the hospital,

1251
01:31:03,991 --> 01:31:05,593
the ambulance will come
and take me away

1252
01:31:05,593 --> 01:31:08,061
and this guy is gonna
forget the baby in the crib.''

1253
01:31:10,298 --> 01:31:15,167
That for me was the thing.

1254
01:31:17,104 --> 01:31:21,165
When l woke up
and l hadn't died,

1255
01:31:21,909 --> 01:31:26,369
l thought, ''Fuck,
there's a baby in the crib.''

1256
01:31:31,319 --> 01:31:32,786
And so...

1257
01:31:35,623 --> 01:31:38,592
l think that was my salvation.

1258
01:31:42,930 --> 01:31:46,093
l think the baby
was my redemption.

1259
01:31:50,137 --> 01:31:52,901
The baby was my redemption.

1260
01:32:06,387 --> 01:32:08,082
Sorry.

1261
01:32:09,290 --> 01:32:11,792
But you've gotten over all this.

1262
01:32:11,792 --> 01:32:18,459
Sure, but the memory ofthat,
the panic ofthat moment.

1263
01:32:20,001 --> 01:32:23,960
l'm sorry, it got to me.

1264
01:32:26,707 --> 01:32:29,410
You never had another
violent relationship?

1265
01:32:29,410 --> 01:32:33,608
No, never again.
Not like that.

1266
01:32:34,315 --> 01:32:37,018
My life moved on...

1267
01:32:37,018 --> 01:32:39,782
l think it led me
to another direction.

1268
01:32:41,022 --> 01:32:43,889
We were together
for a long time.

1269
01:32:44,325 --> 01:32:47,528
We had two children...
A lot of things happened.

1270
01:32:47,528 --> 01:32:50,691
l think that
when a break happens...

1271
01:32:52,233 --> 01:32:57,338
lt's very... significant.

1272
01:32:57,338 --> 01:33:00,307
lt's something that really
changes your life.

1273
01:33:00,875 --> 01:33:03,639
Man, it's been so long.

1274
01:33:04,779 --> 01:33:10,240
l didn't think it would affect me.
Sorry.

1275
01:35:00,795 --> 01:35:02,228
ls it over?

1276
01:35:10,662 --> 01:35:20,686
