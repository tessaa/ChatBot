1
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,960
I beIieve in America.

2
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,120
America has made my fortune.

3
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,240
And I raised my daughter
in the American fashion.

4
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:01,160
I gave her freedom, but I taught her
never to dishonour her famiIy.

5
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,240
She found a boyfriend, not an ItaIian.

6
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,680
She went to the movies with him.
She stayed out Iate.

7
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,240
I didn't protest.

8
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,840
Two months ago he took her for a drive
with another boyfriend.

9
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,440
They made her drink whiskey

10
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,320
and then they tried to
take advantage of her.

11
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,960
She resisted, she kept her honour.

12
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,440
So they beat her Iike an animaI.

13
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,400
When I went to the hospitaI,
her nose was broken,

14
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,200
her jaw was shattered,
heId together by wire.

15
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,360
She couIdn't even weep
because of the pain.

16
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:55,040
But I wept. Why did I weep?

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,600
She was the Iight of my Iife.

18
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,240
BeautifuI girI.

19
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,400
Now she wiII never be beautifuI again.

20
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,480
Sorry.

21
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,600
I went to the poIice,
Iike a good American.

22
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,720
These two boys were brought to triaI.

23
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,600
The judge sentenced them to three years
in prison, but suspended the sentence.

24
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:44,240
Suspended the sentence!
They went free that very day!

25
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,040
I stood in the courtroom Iike a fooI.

26
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:53,560
Those two bastards, they smiIed at me.

27
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:59,440
Then I said to my wife, "For justice,
we must go to Don CorIeone."

28
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,400
Why did you go to the poIice?
Why didn't you come to me first?

29
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:13,880
What do you want of me? TeII me
anything, but do what I beg you to do.

30
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,840
What is that?

31
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,400
I want them dead.

32
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,560
That I cannot do.

33
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,040
I'II give you anything you ask.

34
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:52,640
I've known you many years, but this
is the first time you've asked for heIp.

35
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,800
I can't remember the Iast time
you invited me for a cup of coffee.

36
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,280
Even though my wife is godmother
to your onIy chiId.

37
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,200
But Iet's be frank here.
You never wanted my friendship.

38
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,920
And you were afraid to be in my debt.

39
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,200
I didn't want to get into troubIe.

40
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,440
I understand.

41
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,880
You found Paradise in America.

42
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,720
You made a good Iiving, had poIice
protection and there were courts of Iaw.

43
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,760
You didn't need a friend Iike me.

44
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,440
But now you come to me and say,

45
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,600
"Don CorIeone, give me justice."

46
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,400
But you don't ask with respect.

47
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,560
You don't offer friendship. You don't
even think to caII me Godfather.

48
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:55,200
You come on my daughter's wedding
day and ask me to murder for money.

49
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,800
I ask you for justice.

50
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,680
That is not justice.
Your daughter is aIive.

51
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,560
Let them suffer, then, as she suffers.

52
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,800
How much shaII I pay you?

53
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,080
Bonasera, Bonasera.

54
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,040
What have I ever done to make you
treat me so disrespectfuIIy?

55
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,640
If you'd come in friendship,

56
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:39,800
the scum that ruined your daughter
wouId be suffering this very day.

57
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,760
And if an honest man Iike you shouId
make enemies, they'd be my enemies.

58
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,640
And then they wouId fear you.

59
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,320
Be my friend?

60
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,480
Godfather?

61
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,080
Good.

62
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:13,800
Some day, and that day may never
come, I'II ask a service of you.

63
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,560
But untiI that day...

64
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,640
...accept this justice as a gift
on my daughter's wedding day.

65
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,520
- Grazie, Godfather.
- Prego.

66
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,960
Give this to CIemenza.

67
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,040
I want peopIe that aren't going to
get carried away.

68
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,120
We're not murderers,
in spite of what this undertaker says.

69
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,480
- Where's MichaeI?
- Don't worry, he'II be here.

70
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,520
We're not taking the picture
without MichaeI.

71
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,480
- What's the matter?
- It's MichaeI.

72
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,680
Don Barzini.

73
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,240
Hey, PauIie! Let me have some wine.

74
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,840
PauIie! More wine.

75
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:39,560
- You Iook terrific on the fIoor.
- Are you a dance judge or something?

76
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,520
Take a waIk and do your job.

77
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,960
Sandra, watch the kids.
Don't Iet them run wiId.

78
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,920
You watch yourseIf, aII right?

79
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:20,920
20, 30 grand. In smaII biIIs, cash.

80
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,880
In that IittIe siIk purse.

81
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,520
If this were somebody eIse's wedding...
Sfortunato!

82
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,000
Hey, PauIie!

83
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,960
Stupid jerk!

84
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,440
What's the matter?

85
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,400
- Have to go back to work.
- Tom.

86
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:03,160
No SiciIian can refuse any request
on his daughter's wedding day.

87
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:13,440
Don CorIeone, I'm honoured and
gratefuI that you have invited me.

88
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:21,200
Get out of here!
It's a private party. Go on!

89
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,720
What is it? It's my sister's wedding.

90
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,120
Goddamn FBI don't respect nothing!

91
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,200
Come here, come here, come here!

92
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:57,760
...but towards the end, he was paroIed
to heIp with the American war effort,

93
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,720
so for six months he's worked
in my pastry shop.

94
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,000
Nazorine, what can I do for you?

95
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,280
Now that the war is over,

96
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,440
this boy, Enzo, they want to
repatriate him back to ItaIy.

97
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:14,640
Godfather, I have a daughter.
You see, she and Enzo...

98
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,720
You want Enzo to stay in this country,
and your daughter to be married.

99
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,000
You understand everything.

100
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,360
Mr Hagen. Thank you.

101
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,000
Wait tiII you see the wedding cake
I made for your daughter!

102
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,920
The bride, the groom and the angeI...

103
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,840
- Who shouId I give this job to?
- Not to our paisà.

104
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:50,160
Give it to a Jew Congressman in
another district. Who eIse is on the Iist?

105
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,800
Hey, MichaeI!

106
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:21,120
He's not on the Iist,
but Luca Brasi wants to see you.

107
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,440
Is this necessary?

108
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:33,480
He didn't expect to be invited to the
wedding, so he wanted to thank you.

109
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:39,480
Don CorIeone, I'm honoured and
gratefuI that you have invited me

110
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,880
on the wedding day of your daughter.
May their first chiId be a mascuIine chiId.

111
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,640
MichaeI...

112
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:52,080
That man over there
is taIking to himseIf.

113
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,000
See that scary guy over there?

114
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,040
- He's a very scary guy.
- What's his name?

115
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,960
His name is Luca Brasi.
He heIps my father out sometimes.

116
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,480
MichaeI, he's coming over here!

117
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,280
You Iook terrific!

118
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,680
My brother Tom Hagen,
Miss Kay Adams.

119
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,400
Your father's been asking for you.

120
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,480
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

121
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,600
Why does your brother
have a different name?

122
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,200
My brother Sonny found Tom Hagen
in the street.

123
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,480
He had no home,
so my father took him in.

124
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,680
He's been with us ever since.

125
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,360
He's a good Iawyer.

126
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,920
Not a SiciIian. I think he's
going to be consigliere.

127
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,800
- What's that?
- That's a...

128
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,280
...Iike a counseIIor, an advisor.
Very important for the famiIy.

129
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,640
You Iike your Iasagne?

130
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,880
Don CorIeone.

131
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,360
I'm honoured and gratefuI

132
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,520
that you have invited me
to your daughter's wedding.

133
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,120
On the day of your daughter's wedding.

134
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:22,440
And I hope that their first chiId
wiII be a mascuIine chiId.

135
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:28,720
I pIedge my ever-ending IoyaIty.

136
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:34,920
- For your daughter's bridaI purse.
- Thank you, Luca. Most vaIued friend.

137
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,320
Don CorIeone, I'm going to Ieave you
now, because I know you're busy.

138
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,480
Thank you.

139
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,880
Signora CorIeone!

140
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,760
No!

141
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,600
Senator CauIey apoIogised for not
coming, but said you'd understand.

142
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,000
AIso some of the judges.
They've aII sent gifts.

143
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,200
What is that outside?

144
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,840
Johnny! Johnny!

145
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,960
I Iove you!

146
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,840
He came aII the way from CaIifornia.
I toId you he'd come!

147
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:28,200
- He's probabIy in troubIe again.
- He's a good godson.

148
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,920
Johnny, Johnny! Sing a song!

149
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,080
You never said you knew
Johnny Fontane!

150
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,120
- Sure. You want to meet him?
- Great! Sure.

151
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,040
- My father heIped him with his career.
- He did?

152
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,200
How?

153
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,120
- Let's Iisten to this song.
- MichaeI...

154
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,200
PIease, MichaeI. TeII me.

155
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,480
When Johnny was starting out, he was
signed to a personaI service contract

156
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,160
with a big bandIeader.

157
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:54,320
And as his career got better and better,
he wanted to get out of it.

158
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,000
Johnny is my father's godson.

159
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,280
My father went to see this bandIeader.

160
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,080
He offered him 10,000 doIIars
to Iet Johnny go,

161
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,680
but the bandIeader said no.

162
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,200
So the next day my father went to see
him, but this time with Luca Brasi.

163
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,880
Within an hour,

164
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:21,720
he signed a reIease
for a certified cheque of 1,000 doIIars.

165
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,920
- How did he do that?
- Made him an offer he couIdn't refuse.

166
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:32,960
- What was that?
- Luca Brasi heId a gun to his head,

167
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,240
and father said that either his brains or
his signature wouId be on the contract.

168
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,920
That's a true story.

169
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,760
That's my famiIy, Kay. It's not me.

170
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,120
BeautifuI!

171
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,720
I'II take care of it.

172
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,480
Tom...

173
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,680
I want you to find Santino.
TeII him to come to the office.

174
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,120
How are you, Fredo?

175
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,680
My brother Fredo,
this is Kay Adams.

176
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,080
- Hi.
- How are you doing?

177
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,960
- This is my brother Mike.
- Are you having a good time?

178
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,120
Yeah. This is your friend?

179
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:19,920
I don't know what to do.
My voice is weak. It's weak.

180
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:26,800
Anyway, if I had this part in the picture,
it puts me right back on top again.

181
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,160
But this... man won't give it to me,
the head of the studio.

182
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,360
- What's his name?
- WoItz.

183
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,840
He won't give it to me,
and he says there's no chance.

184
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,320
Sonny?

185
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,520
Sonny?

186
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,480
Sonny?

187
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,360
- Sonny, are you in there?
- What?

188
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,960
The oId man wants you.

189
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,200
One minute.

190
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:21,560
A month ago he bought the movie rights
to this book, a best-seIIer.

191
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,000
The main character
is a guy just Iike me.

192
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,920
I wouIdn't even have to act.

193
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,720
Godfather, I don't know what to do.

194
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,800
You can act Iike a man!
What's the matter with you?

195
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,200
Is this how you turned out a HoIIywood
finocchio, that cries Iike a woman?

196
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,400
"What can I do? What can I do?"
What is that nonsense?

197
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,280
RidicuIous.

198
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,600
- You spend time with your famiIy?
- Sure I do.

199
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,240
Good.

200
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,400
Because a man who doesn't spend time
with his famiIy can never be a reaI man.

201
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,440
You Iook terribIe. I want you to eat.

202
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,640
Rest, and in a month this HoIIywood
big shot wiII give you what you want.

203
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,800
It's too Iate, they start shooting
in a week.

204
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,160
I'm going to make him an offer
he can't refuse.

205
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:30,000
Just go outside and enjoy yourseIf,
and forget about aII this nonsense.

206
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,640
- I want you to Ieave it aII to me.
- AII right.

207
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:03,520
- What time does my daughter Ieave?
- Soon, after they cut the cake.

208
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,120
Do we give your son-in-Iaw
something important?

209
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:12,400
Never. Give him a Iiving, but never
discuss the famiIy business with him.

210
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,040
- What eIse?
- VirgiI SoIIozzo caIIed.

211
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:19,640
- We'II have to see him next week.
- When you come back from CaIifornia.

212
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,640
- When am I going to CaIifornia?
- Tonight.

213
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:29,280
I want you to taIk to this movie big shot
and settIe this business for Johnny.

214
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:34,760
If there's nothing eIse, I'd Iike to go
to my daughter's wedding.

215
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,240
CarIo, we're going to take the picture.

216
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,000
Wait a minute.

217
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,680
No, MichaeI. Not me.

218
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,040
Okay, that's it. Just Iike that. HoId it!

219
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,600
- You need a IittIe more heat on that arc.
- Start taIking.

220
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,440
I was sent by a friend
of Johnny Fontane.

221
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,960
This friend wouId give
his friendship to Mr WoItz,

222
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,680
if Mr WoItz wouId grant us a favour.

223
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,040
WoItz is Iistening.

224
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,200
Give Johnny the part in that war fiIm
you're starting next week.

225
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,280
And what favour wouId your friend
grant Mr WoItz?

226
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,760
He couId make your future union
probIems disappear.

227
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,720
And one of your stars has just moved
from marijuana to heroin.

228
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:17,920
Are you trying to muscIe me?
Listen, you son-of-a-bitch!

229
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:22,560
Let me Iay it on the Iine. Johnny
Fontane wiII never get that movie!

230
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:26,960
No matter how many Dago Guinea
greasebaIIs come out of the woodwork!

231
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:30,760
- I'm German-Irish.
- Listen here, my Kraut-Mick friend.

232
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,160
- I'm going to make troubIe for you!
- I'm a Iawyer. I haven't threatened...

233
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,320
I know New York's big Iawyers.
Who are you?

234
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:43,840
I have a speciaI practice. I handIe
one cIient. I'II wait for your caII.

235
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,680
By the way, I admire your pictures
very much.

236
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,000
Check him out.

237
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,360
- It's reaIIy beautifuI.
- Look at this.

238
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:22,840
- It used to decorate a king's paIace.
- Very nice.

239
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,600
Why didn't you say
you work for CorIeone?

240
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,720
I thought you were some cheap hustIer
Johnny was running in.

241
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,720
- I onIy use his name when necessary.
- How's your drink?

242
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,960
- Fine.
- Now I'II show you something beautifuI.

243
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,840
You do appreciate beauty, don't you?

244
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,480
There you are.
600,000 doIIars on four hoofs.

245
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:48,240
I bet Russian czars never paid
that for a singIe horse.

246
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,440
Khartoum.

247
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,320
Khartoum.

248
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:57,800
I'm not going to race him, though.
I'm going to put him out to stud.

249
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,400
Thanks, Tony.

250
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,640
Let's get something to eat.

251
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,160
CorIeone is Johnny's godfather.

252
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,480
To the ItaIian peopIe that's
a very sacred, cIose reIationship.

253
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:17,080
I respect it. TeII him to ask me anything
eIse. This favour I can't give him.

254
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,960
He never asks a second favour
when he's been refused the first.

255
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:26,120
You don't understand. Johnny Fontane
never gets that movie.

256
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:30,760
That part is perfect for him.
It'II make him a big star.

257
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,240
I'm going to run him out of the business,
and Iet me teII you why.

258
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,120
Johnny Fontane ruined one of WoItz
InternationaI's most vaIuabIe protégés.

259
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:46,280
We trained her for five years.
Singing, acting, dancing Iessons.

260
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,880
I spent hundreds of thousands of doIIars
on her, to make her a big star.

261
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,520
Let me be even more frank.

262
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:58,400
To show you that I'm not a hard-hearted
man. That it's not aII doIIars and cents.

263
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:02,000
She was beautifuI.
She was young and innocent!

264
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:07,160
She's the greatest piece of ass I've had
and I've had them aII over the worId.

265
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:13,240
Then Johnny Fontane comes aIong with
his oIive oiI voice and Guinea charm.

266
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,920
And she runs off.

267
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:19,400
She threw it aII away
just to make me Iook ridicuIous!

268
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:25,240
And a man in my position can't afford
to be made to Iook ridicuIous!

269
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,600
You get the heII out of here!

270
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:32,040
If that goombah tries any rough stuff,
teII him I'm no bandIeader.

271
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,120
Yeah, I heard that story.

272
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,440
Thank you for dinner
and a very pIeasant evening.

273
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,120
Maybe your car can take me
to the airport.

274
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:47,200
Mr CorIeone insists on hearing
bad news immediateIy.

275
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:38,760
- You're not too tired, are you, Tom?
- No, I sIept on the pIane.

276
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,760
I have the SoIIozzo notes here.

277
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,040
Now...

278
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:50,040
SoIIozzo is known as The Turk. He's
supposed to be very good with a knife,

279
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:54,640
but only in matters of business
with reasonable complaint.

280
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,800
His business is narcotics.

281
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
He has fields in Turkey,
where they grow poppy.

282
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,960
ln Sicily he has plants to process them
into heroin.

283
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,600
He needs cash, he needs protection
from the police.

284
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:12,320
He'll give a piece of the action.
l don't know how much.

285
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:18,480
The Tattaglia family is behind him here.
They have to be in it for something.

286
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:22,960
- What about his prison record?
- One term in ItaIy, one here.

287
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,640
He's known as a top narcotics man.

288
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:31,040
- Santino, what do you think?
- A Iot of money in that white powder.

289
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,960
Tom?

290
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:37,920
Yes. There's more money in narcotics
than anything else.

291
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:42,520
lf we don't get into it, somebody else
will, maybe the five families.

292
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,960
With that money they can buy
more poIice and poIiticaI power.

293
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,120
Then they come after us.

294
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:55,120
Now we have unions and gambIing, and
that's great, but narcotics is the future.

295
00:33:55,320 --> 00:34:00,800
If we don't get a piece of that action,
we risk everything in ten years' time.

296
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,840
So? What's your answer
going to be, Pop?

297
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,640
Don CorIeone.

298
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,160
I need a man who has powerfuI friends.

299
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,800
I need a miIIion doIIars in cash.

300
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,720
I need those poIiticians that you carry
in your pocket, Iike nickeIs and dimes.

301
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:32,720
- What is the interest for my famiIy?
- 30 per cent.

302
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:36,880
In the first year your end shouId be
three, four miIIion doIIars.

303
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,680
And then it wouId go up.

304
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:43,320
And what is the interest
for the TattagIia famiIy?

305
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,320
My compIiments.

306
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,920
I'II take care of them, out of my share.

307
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:57,680
So I receive 30 per cent for finance,

308
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:01,040
poIiticaI infIuence and IegaI protection?

309
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,800
That's right.

310
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,640
Why do you come to me?
Why do I deserve this generosity?

311
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:12,800
If you consider a miIIion doIIars in cash
just finance,

312
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,680
ti saluto, Don CorIeone.

313
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:30,000
I said that I wouId see you, because
I heard you were a serious man,

314
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,400
to be treated with respect.

315
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,280
But, I must say no to you.

316
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,680
And I'II give you my reason.

317
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:47,760
It's true, I have a Iot of friends in poIitics.

318
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:52,400
They wouIdn't be friendIy Iong if I was
invoIved in drugs instead of gambIing,

319
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:57,840
which they regard as a harmIess vice,
but drugs is a dirty business.

320
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:02,440
It doesn't make any difference to me
what a man does for a Iiving.

321
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:07,680
But your business is...
a IittIe dangerous.

322
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:11,760
If you're worried about security,
the TattagIias wiII guarantee it.

323
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:15,920
- The TattagIias wouId guarantee our...
- Wait a minute.

324
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:26,760
I have a sentimentaI weakness
for my chiIdren, and I spoiI them.

325
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,520
They taIk when they shouId Iisten.
But anyway...

326
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:35,680
Signor SoIIozzo, my no is finaI. I wish to
congratuIate you on your new business.

327
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,760
I know you'II do weII, and good Iuck.

328
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:43,920
EspeciaIIy since your interests
don't confIict with mine. Thank you.

329
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,240
Santino.

330
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,800
Come here.

331
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:15,640
What's the matter with you? Your brain
is going soft from pIaying with that girI.

332
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:20,200
Never teII anybody outside the famiIy
what you're thinking again.

333
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,880
Go on.

334
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,720
Tom, what's this nonsense?

335
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,600
It's from Johnny.
He's starring in that new fiIm.

336
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,120
- Take it away.
- Take it over there.

337
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,680
And...

338
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,120
...teII Luca Brasi to come in.

339
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,680
I'm a IittIe worried
about this SoIIozzo feIIow.

340
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,520
Find out what he's got
under his fingernaiIs.

341
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,160
Go to the TattagIias.

342
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:04,320
Make them think that you're not
too happy with our famiIy

343
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:07,480
and find out what you can.

344
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,680
I got something for your mother
and for Sonny

345
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:31,360
and a tie for Freddy,
and Tom Hagen got the ReynoIds pen.

346
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:35,520
- What do you want for Christmas?
- Just you.

347
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,880
Andiamo, Fredo.

348
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:10,360
- TeII PauIie to get the car.
- Okay, Pop.

349
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,520
I'II have to get it myseIf.
PauIie caIIed in sick this morning.

350
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:19,360
PauIie's a good kid.
I don't mind getting the car.

351
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,360
Buon Natale, caro. Grazie.

352
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,480
- Luca! I'm Bruno TattagIia.
- I know.

353
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,040
You know who I am?

354
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,400
I know you.

355
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,600
You have been taIking to the
TattagIia famiIy...right?

356
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:31,400
I think you and I can do business.

357
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,360
I need someone strong Iike you.

358
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,920
I heard you are not happy...

359
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,240
...with the CorIeone famiIy.

360
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,840
Want to join me?

361
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,240
What's in it for me?

362
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,120
$50,000 to start with.

363
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,440
Not bad!

364
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,600
Agreed?

365
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,040
Tom! Tom Hagen. Merry Christmas.

366
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:03,280
- GIad to see you. I want to taIk to you.
- I haven't got time.

367
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:07,200
Make time, Consigliere. Get in the car.

368
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:12,640
What are you worried about? If I wanted
to kiII you, you'd be dead aIready.

369
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,400
Get in.

370
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:28,720
- Fredo, I'm going to buy some fruit.
- Okay, Pop.

371
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:37,560
Merry Christmas. I want some fruit.

372
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:05,480
WouId you Iike me better
if I were a nun? Like in the story.

373
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,400
No.

374
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:13,920
- What if I were Ingrid Bergman?
- Now, that's a thought.

375
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,520
MichaeI.

376
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:22,640
No, I wouIdn't Iike you better if you were
Ingrid Bergman. What's the matter?

377
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,640
They don't say if he's dead or aIive.

378
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,120
- Sonny, it's MichaeI.
- Where have you been?

379
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,840
- Is he aII right?
- We don't know yet.

380
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:12,520
There are all kinds of stories.
He was hit bad, Mikey.

381
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,720
- Are you there?
- Yeah, I'm here.

382
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:21,120
- Where have you been? l was worried.
- Didn't Tom teII you I caIIed?

383
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:25,840
No. Look, come home, kid.
You should be with Mama, you hear?

384
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,880
Oh, my God.

385
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,800
Sonny!

386
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,120
Stay back there.

387
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:53,360
- Who is it?
- Open up, it's CIemenza.

388
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:58,160
There's more news about your oId man.

389
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,960
Word is out that he's aIready dead.

390
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:04,640
- What's the matter with you?
- Take it easy!

391
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:07,920
- Where was PauIie?
- Sick. He's been sick aII winter.

392
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:10,560
- How often?
- OnIy three, four times.

393
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:14,320
- Freddy didn't want a new bodyguard.
- Pick him up now.

394
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:18,760
I don't care how sick he is. Bring him
to my father's house right now.

395
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,560
- You want anyone sent over here?
- No. Go ahead.

396
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:33,120
I'm going to have a coupIe of our peopIe
come over to the house.

397
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:39,320
- HeIIo?
- Santino Corleone?

398
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,240
- Yeah.
- We have Tom Hagen.

399
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:45,680
ln three hours he'll be released
with our proposition.

400
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:49,000
Listen to what he has to say
before you do anything.

401
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:53,600
What's done is done. Don't lose that
famous temper of yours, Sonny.

402
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,880
I'II wait.

403
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,680
Your boss is dead.

404
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:18,640
I know you're not in the muscIe end
of the famiIy, so don't be scared.

405
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:23,880
I want you to heIp the CorIeones
and me.

406
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:31,000
We got him outside his office
about an hour after we picked you up.

407
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:33,680
Drink it.

408
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:41,200
It's up to you to make peace
between me and Sonny.

409
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:49,200
Sonny was hot for my deaI, wasn't he?

410
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:52,960
And you knew
it was the right thing to do.

411
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:58,520
- Sonny wiII come after you.
- That wiII be his first reaction, sure.

412
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:05,120
So you have to taIk sense into him.
The TattagIia famiIy is behind me.

413
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:10,680
The other New York famiIies wiII go
aIong with anything to prevent war.

414
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:16,240
Let's face it, with aII due respect,
the Don - rest in peace - was sIipping.

415
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:22,040
Ten years ago,
couId I have gotten to him?

416
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:29,760
WeII, now he's dead, Tom,
and nothing can bring him back.

417
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:36,840
You've got to taIk to Sonny, to the
Caporegimes, Tessio, fat CIemenza.

418
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,320
It's good business, Tom.

419
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:49,520
I'II try. But even Sonny won't be abIe
to caII off Luca Brasi.

420
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:54,160
Yeah, weII...

421
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,000
Let me worry about Luca.

422
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,720
You just taIk to Sonny.

423
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,640
And the other two kids.

424
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:13,200
- I'II do my best.
- Good.

425
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,640
Now you can go.

426
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,480
I don't Iike vioIence, Tom.
I'm a businessman.

427
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:31,320
BIood is a big expense.

428
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,840
He's stiII aIive.

429
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:56,600
They hit him with five shots,
and he's stiII aIive!

430
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:01,760
That's bad Iuck for me, and bad Iuck
for you if you don't make that deaI.

431
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,800
Your mother is at the hospitaI with
your father. Looks Iike he'II puII through.

432
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:56,760
It's a Iot of bad bIood. SoIIozzo, PhiIip
TattagIia, Bruno TattagIia, Ramon...

433
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,760
- You gonna kiII aII those guys?
- Stay out of it.

434
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:02,800
If you get rid of SoIIozzo,
everything faIIs into Iine.

435
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,160
What about Luca?
SoIIozzo thinks he can controI him.

436
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:10,600
If Luca soId out, we're in a Iot of troubIe.

437
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:14,400
- Has anyone been in touch with Luca?
- We've been trying aII night.

438
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:19,160
- Hey, do me a favour...
- Luca never sIeeps over with a broad.

439
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:26,040
WeII, Tom, you're consigliere.
What do we do if the oId man dies?

440
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:32,240
If we Iose the oId man, we Iose the
poIiticaI contacts and haIf our strength.

441
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:37,480
The other New York famiIies might
support SoIIozzo to avoid a Iong war.

442
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:42,000
This is aImost ¨1 946.
Nobody wants bIoodshed anymore.

443
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,840
If your father dies...

444
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:47,640
...you make the deaI.

445
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:52,360
- Easy to say. He's not your father.
- I'm as much a son as you or Mike.

446
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:59,000
What is it?

447
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:04,160
- PauIie, I toId you to stay put.
- The guy at the gates has a package.

448
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:07,520
Tessio, go see what it is.

449
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:12,240
- ShaII I stay?
- Yeah. Are you aII right?

450
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:15,960
- I'm fine.
- There's food. Are you hungry?

451
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:19,480
- No.
- A drink? Brandy wiII sweat it out.

452
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:22,240
- Go ahead.
- That might be a good idea.

453
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:28,600
Take care of that son-of-a-bitch.
PauIie soId out the oId man.

454
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,960
- Make that the first thing on your Iist.
- Understood.

455
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:37,320
Mickey, tomorrow, get some guys
and go to Luca's apartment.

456
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:41,320
Maybe we shouIdn't get Mike
mixed up in this too directIy.

457
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,920
Hanging around the house on
the phone wouId be a big heIp.

458
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:49,760
Try Luca again.

459
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:00,760
- What's this?
- A SiciIian message.

460
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,600
It means Luca Brasi
sIeeps with the fishes.

461
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:19,080
- I'm going.
- When wiII you be home?

462
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,480
ProbabIy Iate.

463
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:26,480
- Don't forget the cannoli!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

464
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:33,000
Rocco, sit on the other side.
You bIock the rear-view mirror.

465
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:37,840
Sonny's running wiId. He wants
to go to mattresses aIready.

466
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:43,280
We have to find a spot on the
West Side. Try 309 West 43rd Street.

467
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:46,840
- Know a good spot on the West Side?
- I'II think about it.

468
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:50,480
Think whiIe you're driving.
I want to hit New York this month.

469
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:52,520
Watch the kids.

470
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:08,160
PauIie, go down 39th Street, pick up
¨1 8 mattresses and bring me the biII.

471
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:09,720
Yeah, aII right.

472
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:14,160
Make sure they're cIean, because
the guys wiII be there a Iong time.

473
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:18,320
- They're cIean and exterminated.
- That's a bad word to use.

474
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:22,240
Exterminate! Watch out,
so we don't exterminate you!

475
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:31,240
PuII over. I've got to take a Ieak.

476
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:14,440
Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.

477
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,880
Hey, Mike! Hey, Mikey!

478
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,280
- Yeah.
- Phone caII!

479
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:46,640
- Who is it?
- Some girI.

480
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,880
- HeIIo. Kay?
- How's your father?

481
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:54,760
He's going to make it.

482
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,360
l love you.

483
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,960
l love you!

484
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:03,200
- Michael?
- Yeah, I know.

485
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:06,080
- Tell me you love me.
- I can't taIk.

486
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,440
Can't you say it?

487
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,960
I'II see you tonight.

488
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:14,720
Why don't you teII that nice girI
you Iove her?

489
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:20,320
I Iove you with aII my heart. If I don't
see you again soon, I'm going to die!

490
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:25,040
Come and Iearn something. You might
have to cook for 20 guys some day.

491
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:28,720
You start with a IittIe oiI,
then fry some garIic.

492
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:34,000
Throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste,
fry it and make sure it doesn't stick.

493
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:39,120
You get it to a boiI, you shove in
aII your sausage and meatbaIIs.

494
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:42,480
Add a IittIe bit of wine.

495
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:49,360
And a IittIe bit of sugar. That's my trick.

496
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:53,640
Cut the crap. I have more important
things for you. How's PauIie?

497
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:56,760
You won't see him anymore.

498
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,600
- Where are you going?
- To the city.

499
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:03,040
- Send bodyguards with him.
- I'm going to the hospitaI...

500
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:06,280
He'II be aII right. SoIIozzo knows
he's a civiIian.

501
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,080
- Be carefuI.
- Yes, sir.

502
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:13,440
Send somebody with him anyway.

503
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:43,680
- I have to go.
- Can I go with you?

504
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,280
No, Kay. There wiII be detectives there,
peopIe from the press.

505
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:51,840
I'II wait in the cab.

506
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:56,720
I don't want you to get invoIved.

507
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:02,080
When wiII I see you again?

508
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:11,240
Go back to New Hampshire, and I'II
caII you at your parents' house.

509
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:17,600
- When wiII I see you again, MichaeI?
- I don't know.

510
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:27,760
What are you doing here?
You're not supposed to be here.

511
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:30,920
I'm MichaeI CorIeone. This is my father.

512
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:33,800
What happened to the guards?

513
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,960
Your father had too many visitors.
They interfered with hospitaI service.

514
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:42,600
The poIice made them Ieave
about ten minutes ago.

515
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:50,320
Get me Long Beach 45620, pIease.

516
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:55,640
Nurse. Wait a minute. Stay here.

517
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:03,400
Sonny, I'm at the hospitaI.
I got here Iate, there's nobody here.

518
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:07,440
No Tessio's men, no detectives,
nobody. Papa's aII aIone.

519
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:10,280
- Don't panic.
- I won't panic.

520
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:14,480
I'm sorry, but you wiII have to Ieave.

521
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:22,400
We're going to move him to another
room. Can you disconnect the tubes?

522
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:25,960
- That's out of the question!
- Do you know my father?

523
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:30,120
Men are coming here to kiII him.
Do you understand?

524
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:32,360
HeIp me, pIease.

525
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:49,760
- Who are you?
- I am Enzo, the baker.

526
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:52,600
- Remember me?
- Enzo.

527
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:55,560
You'd better go,
there's going to be troubIe.

528
01:02:55,760 --> 01:03:00,360
If there is troubIe, I'II stay here to
heIp you. For your father.

529
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:06,000
Listen. Wait for me outside,
in front of the hospitaI, aII right?

530
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:08,240
I'II be out in a minute.

531
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:25,720
Just Iie here, Pop.
I'II take care of you now.

532
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:28,960
I'm with you now.

533
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:31,920
I'm with you.

534
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:08,040
Get rid of these. Come here.

535
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:13,760
Put your hand in your pocket, Iike you
have a gun. You'II be aII right.

536
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:04,400
You did good.

537
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:53,600
I thought aII you Guinea hoods
were Iocked up!

538
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:57,840
- Why isn't anyone guarding my father?
- You IittIe punk!

539
01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:01,920
Don't you teII me my business!
I puIIed them off.

540
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:07,840
- Stay away from this hospitaI!
- Not untiI my father's room is guarded.

541
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:11,400
- PhiI, take him in!
- The kid's cIean, Captain.

542
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:16,040
- He's a war hero. He's never been...
- I said take him in!

543
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:23,160
- What's The Turk paying you?
- Take a hoId of him. Stand him up.

544
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:25,240
Stand him up straight.

545
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:51,200
I'm the CorIeone's attorney. These men
are hired to protect Vito CorIeone.

546
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:53,680
They're Iicensed to carry firearms.

547
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:58,720
If you interfere, you'II have to appear
before the judge and show cause.

548
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:01,000
Let him go.

549
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:35,400
- What's with aII the new faces?
- We'II need them now.

550
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:38,160
After the hospitaI thing, Sonny got mad.

551
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:41,280
We hit Bruno TattagIia this morning.

552
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:44,480
Jesus Christ.

553
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:53,720
Looks Iike a fortress around here.

554
01:07:55,360 --> 01:08:00,280
Tommasuccio! Hey... ¨1 00 buttonmen
on the street 24 hours a day.

555
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:04,320
That Turk shows one hair on his ass,
he's dead.

556
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,040
Mike, Iet me Iook at you.

557
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:14,800
You're beautifuI, beautifuI.
You're gorgeous.

558
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:20,200
The Turk wants to taIk! Imagine
the nerve of the son-of-a-bitch.

559
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:23,120
- He wants a meeting today.
- What did he say?

560
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:27,480
What did he say... He wants us to send
MichaeI to hear the proposition.

561
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:30,680
He promises that the deaI
is too good to refuse.

562
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:34,040
- And Bruno TattagIia?
- That's part of the deaI.

563
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:38,360
- He canceIs out what they did to Father.
- We shouId Iisten to them.

564
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:41,520
No more! Not this time, Consigliere.

565
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:44,800
No more meetings, discussions,
or SoIIozzo tricks.

566
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,960
I want SoIIozzo, or we go to war...

567
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:50,720
- The other famiIies...
- They hand me SoIIozzo!

568
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:53,480
This is business, not personaI!

569
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:58,160
- They shot my father...
- Even that was business, not personaI.

570
01:08:58,360 --> 01:09:01,800
Then business wiII have to suffer.
Do me a favour.

571
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,440
No more advice on how to
patch things up. Just heIp me win.

572
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:15,480
I found out about Captain McCIuskey,
who broke Mike's jaw.

573
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:19,760
He's definiteIy on SoIIozzo's payroII,
and for big money.

574
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:23,640
McCIuskey has agreed to be
The Turk's bodyguard.

575
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:27,320
So when SoIIozzo is being guarded,
he's invuInerabIe.

576
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:30,960
Nobody has ever gunned down
a New York poIice captain.

577
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:36,680
AII the famiIies wouId come after you.
The CorIeone famiIy wouId be outcasts!

578
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:40,520
Even the oId man's poIiticaI protection
wouId run for cover.

579
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:45,920
Do me a favour.
Take this into consideration.

580
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:51,400
AII right, we'II wait.

581
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:59,240
We can't wait. We can't wait.

582
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:03,960
No matter what SoIIozzo says,
he's going to kiII Pop.

583
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:07,800
That's the key for him.
We've got to get SoIIozzo.

584
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,960
- Mike is right.
- Let me ask you something.

585
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:16,760
What about this McCIuskey?
What do we do with this cop?

586
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:24,680
They want to have a meeting
with me, right?

587
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:29,600
It wiII be me, McCIuskey and SoIIozzo.

588
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:33,680
Let's set the meeting.

589
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:39,080
Get our informers to find out
where it's going to be heId.

590
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:44,160
We insist it's a pubIic pIace.
A bar, a restaurant.

591
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:48,200
Some pIace where there are peopIe,
so I feeI safe.

592
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:53,200
They'II search me when I meet them,
right?

593
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:56,160
So I can't have a weapon on me.

594
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:04,080
But if CIemenza can figure out a way to
have a weapon pIanted there for me...

595
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:11,080
...then I'II kiII them both.

596
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:26,800
Nice coIIege boy. Didn't want to
get mixed up in the famiIy business.

597
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,400
Now you want to shoot a poIice captain
because he sIapped you?

598
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:36,760
This isn't Iike the army! You have to get
cIose and get their brains on your suit.

599
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:39,600
You're taking this very personaI.

600
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:43,000
Tom, this is business
and he's taking it personaI.

601
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:46,800
- Where does it say you can't kiII a cop?
- Mikey...

602
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:53,200
I'm taIking about a cop who's mixed up
in drugs, a dishonest cop.

603
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:57,240
A cop who got mixed up in the rackets
and got what was coming.

604
01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:02,600
That's a terrific story. We have
newspaper peopIe on the payroII, right?

605
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:07,280
- They might Iike a story Iike that.
- They might.

606
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:14,240
It's not personaI, Sonny.
It's strictIy business.

607
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:21,920
It's as coId as they come. ImpossibIe to
trace, so you don't worry about prints.

608
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:26,560
I put a speciaI tape on the trigger
and the butt. Try it.

609
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:40,320
Is the trigger too tight?

610
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,280
My ears!

611
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:49,680
I Ieft it noisy, so it scares away any
pain-in-the-ass innocent bystanders.

612
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:52,880
You've shot them both.
Now what do you do?

613
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:58,240
- Sit down, finish my dinner.
- Don't fooI around.

614
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:01,760
Let your hand drop to your side
and Iet the gun sIip out.

615
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:06,000
Everybody wiII stiII think you've got it.
They'II stare at your face,

616
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:08,920
so waIk out fast, but don't run.

617
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:12,400
Don't Iook anybody in the eye,
but don't Iook away either.

618
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:15,760
They'II be scared stiff,
so don't worry about nothing.

619
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:21,800
You'II be aII right. You'II take a vacation,
nobody knows where,

620
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,360
and we'II catch the heII.

621
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:28,120
- How bad do you think it wiII be?
- Pretty goddamn bad.

622
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:31,800
AII the other famiIies wiII probabIy
Iine up against us.

623
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:36,800
These things have to happen every five,
ten years. Gets rid of the bad bIood.

624
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Been ten years since the Iast one.
You have to stop them at the beginning.

625
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:47,080
Like they shouId have stopped HitIer in
Munich, not Ietting him get away with it.

626
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:52,080
You know, Mike, we were aII proud
of you. Being a hero and aII.

627
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:54,680
Your father too.

628
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:33,760
Nothing. Not a hint. AbsoIuteIy nothing.

629
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:38,760
Even SoIIozzo's peopIe don't know
where the meeting wiII be heId.

630
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:41,720
How much time do we have?

631
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:46,880
They're going to pick you up outside
Jack Dempsey's in an hour and a haIf.

632
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:52,920
- We couId put a taiI on them.
- SoIIozzo wouId Iose our ass.

633
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:57,840
- What about the negotiator?
- He's pIaying pinochIe with my men.

634
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:02,920
- He's happy. They're Ietting him win.
- Too risky. Maybe we shouId caII it off.

635
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:06,440
The negotiator pIays cards
untiI Mike is back safe.

636
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:10,120
- He couId bIast whoever is in the car.
- They'II expect that.

637
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:13,440
SoIIozzo might not even be
in the car, Sonny!

638
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:15,680
I'II get it.

639
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:41,120
Louis' restaurant in the Bronx.

640
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:44,320
- Is it reIiabIe?
- My man in McCIuskey's precinct.

641
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:50,040
A poIice captain is on caII 24 hours
a day. He'II be there between 8 and ¨1 0.

642
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:54,880
- Anybody know this joint?
- Sure, I do. It's perfect for us.

643
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:59,880
A smaII famiIy pIace, good food.
Everyone minds his business. Perfect.

644
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:05,880
They've got an oId-fashioned toiIet.
You know, the box and the chain thing.

645
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:09,840
We might be abIe to tape the gun
behind it.

646
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:14,400
AII right. Mike, you go to the restaurant,

647
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:18,280
you eat, taIk for a whiIe, you reIax.
Make them reIax.

648
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:23,280
Then you go to take a Ieak. No, better
stiII, you ask permission to go.

649
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:28,000
Then you come back bIasting.
Two shots in the head apiece.

650
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:31,840
I want somebody very good
to pIant that gun.

651
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:34,920
I don't want him coming out
with just his dick.

652
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:40,560
- The gun wiII be there.
- You drive him and pick him up.

653
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:43,160
Let's move.

654
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:50,560
Did he teII you to drop the gun
right away?

655
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:52,920
Yeah, a miIIion times.

656
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:01,840
Don't forget. Two shots apiece in
the head as soon as you come out.

657
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:11,280
How Iong do you think it wiII be
before I can come back?

658
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:13,720
At Ieast a year.

659
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:18,880
I'II square it with Mom, that you're not
seeing her before you Ieave and...

660
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:23,360
I'II get a message to that girIfriend
when the time is right.

661
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:31,280
Take care.

662
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:35,560
Take care, Mike.

663
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:10,240
I'm gIad you came. I hope we can
straighten everything out.

664
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:15,840
It's not the way I wanted things to go.
It shouId never have happened.

665
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:20,320
I want to straighten everything out.
I don't want my father bothered again.

666
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:24,320
I swear on my chiIdren
that he won't be, Mike.

667
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:27,640
But you have to keep an open mind
when we taIk.

668
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:33,160
I hope you're not a hothead Iike Sonny.
You can't taIk business with him.

669
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:35,680
He's a good kid.

670
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:42,520
I'm sorry about the other night, Mike.

671
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:47,680
I've got to frisk you, so turn around.
On your knees, facing me.

672
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:56,280
I guess I'm getting too oId for my job.
Too grouchy.

673
01:18:57,160 --> 01:19:01,040
Can't stand the aggravation.
You know how it is.

674
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:05,840
He's cIean.

675
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:32,360
Going to Jersey?

676
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:36,960
Maybe.

677
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:02,840
Nice work, Lou.

678
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:42,920
- How's the food in this restaurant?
- Try the veaI. It's the best in the city.

679
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:45,560
I'II have it.

680
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:22,120
- I'm going to speak ItaIian to Mikey.
- Go ahead.

681
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:40,640
What I want...

682
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:43,280
What's most important to me...

683
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:49,640
...is that I have a guarantee.
No more attempts on my father's Iife.

684
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:53,800
What guarantees can I give you?
I'm the hunted one!

685
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,320
I missed my chance.
You think too much of me, kid.

686
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:59,640
I'm not that cIever.

687
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:03,240
AII I want is a truce.

688
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:13,120
I have to go to the bathroom.
Is it aII right?

689
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:17,400
When you got to go, you got to go.

690
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:23,640
He's cIean.

691
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:26,640
Don't take too Iong.

692
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:30,920
I've frisked a thousand punks.

693
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:11,680
Okay, you take over.

694
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:30,840
I Iove you, Grandpa.

695
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:35,560
I'm sorry, Pa. He doesn't know you yet.

696
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:39,280
- Hey, big guy. Give it to Grandpa.
- Okay.

697
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:45,440
"I hope you get weII, Grandpa, and wish
I see you soon. Your grandson Frank."

698
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:50,520
Go with your mother.

699
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:53,080
Take them downstairs.

700
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:00,960
Go on, CarIo, you too.

701
01:29:02,120 --> 01:29:03,760
Go on.

702
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:27,200
- What's the matter with you, CarIo?
- Shut up and set the tabIe.

703
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:48,280
Since McCIuskey's kiIIing, the poIice
have cracked down on our operations.

704
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:54,480
And aIso the other famiIies.
There's been a Iot of bad bIood.

705
01:29:54,680 --> 01:29:57,960
They hit us, so we hit them back.

706
01:29:58,440 --> 01:30:02,840
Through our newspaper contacts
we've been abIe to put out materiaI

707
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:07,120
about McCIuskey's Iink with SoIIozzo
in the drug rackets.

708
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:09,400
So things are Ioosening up.

709
01:30:10,360 --> 01:30:17,680
And I sent Fredo to Las Vegas, under
the protection of Don Francesco of L.A.

710
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:23,400
- I want him to rest.
- I'm going to Iearn the casino business.

711
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:31,360
Where's MichaeI?

712
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:46,160
It was MichaeI who kiIIed SoIIozzo.

713
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:52,400
But he's safe. We're starting to work
to bring him back.

714
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:17,000
Did you find out where that oId pimp
TattagIia is hiding? I want him now.

715
01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:20,160
Sonny, things are starting to Ioosen up.

716
01:31:20,360 --> 01:31:24,960
If you go after TattagIia, aII heII
wiII break Ioose. Pop can negotiate.

717
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:30,680
- He must get better first. I'II decide...
- War is costIy. We can't do business.

718
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:34,560
- Neither can they. Don't worry about it!
- We can't afford a staIemate.

719
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:39,520
- No more staIemate. I'II kiII the bastard!
- You're getting a great reputation!

720
01:31:39,720 --> 01:31:45,160
Do as I say! If I had a SiciIian wartime
consigliere, I wouIdn't be in this shape!

721
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:48,320
Pop had Genco. Look what I got.

722
01:31:50,680 --> 01:31:53,120
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

723
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:57,240
Ma made a IittIe dinner. It's Sunday.

724
01:31:57,840 --> 01:32:02,160
Niggers are having a good time
with our poIicy banks in HarIem.

725
01:32:02,360 --> 01:32:06,120
Driving new CadiIIacs,
paying 50 per cent on a bet.

726
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:09,280
That's because they've started
making big money.

727
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:12,760
Poppa never taIked business
at the tabIe.

728
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:17,240
- Shut up, Connie...
- Don't you ever teII her to shut up.

729
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:20,160
Don't interfere.

730
01:32:20,360 --> 01:32:24,320
I'd Iike to taIk to you after dinner.
I couId do more for the famiIy...

731
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:27,240
We don't discuss business at the tabIe.

732
01:33:12,360 --> 01:33:15,000
I kiss your hand, Don Tommasino.

733
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:22,520
Why are you so far
from the house?

734
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:25,360
You know I'm responsibIe to your
father for your Iife.

735
01:33:25,560 --> 01:33:27,560
The bodyguards are here.

736
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:30,000
It's stiII dangerous...

737
01:33:30,200 --> 01:33:32,760
We've heard from Santino
in New York...

738
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:36,080
Your enemies know you're here.

739
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:39,360
Did Santino say when
I can go back?

740
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:41,160
Not yet.

741
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:44,120
It's out of the question.

742
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:49,160
Where are you going now?

743
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:53,640
Take my car.

744
01:33:54,920 --> 01:33:57,360
I want to waIk.

745
01:33:59,160 --> 01:34:00,600
Be carefuI.
