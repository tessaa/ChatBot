1
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,189
<i>Can I get you
to sign right here, please?</i>

2
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:32,128
<i>Okay. Here you go.</i>

3
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:34,325
<i>- Thanks.
- You're welcome.</i>

4
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:40,465
<i>Hi, Will. Package for you.</i>

5
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,515
<i>I don't think anyone ever imagines
on their wedding day</i>

6
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:01,549
<i>they'll be part of the 46%
that doesn't live happily ever after.</i>

7
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:04,122
Will?

8
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:07,029
Just heard we got the Quaker Oats account.

9
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,898
Way to go.
You must be completely psyched.

10
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:11,765
<i>Then again,</i>

11
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:13,396
<i>I never thought I'd spend my days,</i>

12
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:15,873
<i>weeks and years working
in an advertising agency</i>

13
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:20,845
<i>trying to figure out how to get kids to eat
Cap'n Crunch instead of Froot Loops.</i>

14
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:24,640
<i>But Tuesdays and Fridays
are my favorite days.</i>

15
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:29,017
<i>I get out of work early, and I go pick up
my daughter, Maya, from school.</i>

16
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:32,422
<i>Now, it's a great feeling when you find
the right track to go with the day.</i>

17
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:36,428
<i>And today, I have found
the absolute perfect song.</i>

18
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:39,565
<i>Bitches, they can kiss my...</i>

19
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,359
<i>The other perfect song.</i>

20
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,541
Thank you.

21
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:34,113
You're welcome.

22
00:03:57,103 --> 00:04:00,971
<i>But sometimes, no matter
how carefully you plan your playlist,</i>

23
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,009
<i>there is no right track for what awaits you.</i>

24
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,810
- Come on, come on!
- Hey, what's going on?

25
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:16,354
Will, did you know there was gonna be
a sex ed class today?

26
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:17,514
Aren't they kind of young?

27
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,718
- Yeah! It was a total disaster.
- At least it got them reading.

28
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:21,987
There's a book!

29
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:25,428
<i>"The 250 million sperm are ejaculated</i>

30
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:29,229
<i>"and begin their treacherous journey
towards the fallopian tubes!</i>

31
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:30,894
<i>"One hundred million are wiped
out instantly..."</i>

32
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,437
I'm gonna find Maya.

33
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:33,938
Do you still have sex with Daddy?

34
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:35,201
- What are you talking about?
- Do you?

35
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,936
- You know, we will go home and talk...
- You do, don't you?

36
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,274
- We will go home and talk about this.
- I hate you, I hate you!

37
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:45,543
Stop pulling on me! I am trying
to get to the bottom of something!

38
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:47,151
We need to talk.

39
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:51,151
Which is when the man
removes his penis from his pajamas

40
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:52,486
and thrusts it into a woman's vagina...

41
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:56,153
Okay, but Mrs. Gallagher
didn't actually say "thrust."

42
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:57,756
- Yeah.
- Oh.

43
00:04:58,498 --> 00:04:59,726
But what I don't understand,

44
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,666
Sammy Boigon's sister said
he was an accident.

45
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:06,671
I mean, how do you accidentally
thrust a penis into... Hi, Luis.

46
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:08,536
- Hey.
- How do you accidentally...

47
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:13,011
<i>Stop saying "penis" and "thrust."
Just say "tinkle part" or "wee-wee."</i>

48
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,103
Something cute.

49
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,672
- Explain how Sammy was an accident.
- That's complicated.

50
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,818
- Penis! Penis.
- Okay. All right, that's enough.

51
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:23,617
Okay, they...

52
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:27,091
It's not like his dad slipped
on a banana peel.

53
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,494
The accident was that Sammy's mom
got pregnant.

54
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:36,159
If they didn't want a baby,
then how come they had sex?

55
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,665
That's a very good question.

56
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:43,269
I guess you could say
that they were rehearsing.

57
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,805
- Was I an accident?
- No.

58
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,938
- I was, wasn't I?
- No.

59
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:54,009
You were completely and totally on purpose.
I knew exactly what I was getting into.

60
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,050
I think you should tell me
the story of you and my mom.

61
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:03,755
<i>Why do you keep saying "my mom"
like I've never met her?</i>

62
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:08,191
Well, because now that
you're getting divorced,

63
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:11,332
she's mine, not yours.

64
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:13,531
- Is that so?
- Tell me how it happened.

65
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:18,703
<i>And the real story, not the,
"Oh, we met, we fell in love,</i>

66
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:21,372
<i>"and we decided to take all that love</i>

67
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:24,848
<i>"and make a family,
and that's how we made you."</i>

68
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:27,112
You know something?
I'm gonna tell you the real, true story

69
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:28,346
of how me and your mother met.

70
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:30,048
- When I'm old enough.
- Yep.

71
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:33,422
- Look. I know love isn't a fairytale.
- Really?

72
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:34,892
Really.

73
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:38,121
Did you have another girlfriend
before you met her?

74
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:40,765
Come on, tell me the truth.

75
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:44,227
I had two serious girlfriends.

76
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:47,761
And then some other,
a smattering of other women that I dated.

77
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,137
You know.

78
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:50,834
What?

79
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,208
What's the boy word for slut?

80
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:57,071
They still haven't come up with one yet,
but I'm sure they're working on it.

81
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,549
You a vegetarian this week or not?

82
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,085
- Yeah, I am.
- Great.

83
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,553
I'm guessing
you weren't her first boyfriend.

84
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:05,955
Maybe it was some nerdy guy,
or maybe he was mean.

85
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,526
Or maybe

86
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:12,024
you were friends for the longest time,

87
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:15,397
and then just when you were
about to put your penis

88
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:16,594
into somebody else's vagina...

89
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:17,693
Okay. Good night, Maya.

90
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,203
...you realized Mom
was the only one for you!

91
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,398
Bedtime!

92
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:23,271
You still have to tell me
the story of why you fell in love with her.

93
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:26,709
I fell in love with her because
she was smart and beautiful and fun.

94
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:30,010
So now she's stupid and ugly and boring?

95
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:32,380
- Of course not.
- Then what's the problem?

96
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:36,650
- It's complicated, Maya.
- Everything with you is so complicated.

97
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:41,659
I bet that if you just told me the story,
you'd realize that it's not complicated at all.

98
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:44,160
That you just love her.

99
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:47,397
I know this is tough for you,
but what are you thinking?

100
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,231
That I'm gonna tell you this story
and it's gonna make everything better?

101
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,327
It doesn't work that way.

102
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:55,363
Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't.
Tell me and we'll find out.

103
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:59,678
No. Game over. It's time for bed.

104
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:03,681
No, it's not time for bed!
It's time for you to tell me the story!

105
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:05,979
- Maya.
- I need to know!

106
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:09,845
I need to know.

107
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,652
Fine! Fine!

108
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,118
I'm gonna tell you the story,

109
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:16,627
- but I'm not telling you who your mom is.
- Fine.

110
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:18,061
You're just gonna have
to figure it out for yourself.

111
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,461
- Good.
- And I'm changing all the names

112
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:21,898
and some of the facts,
but I just decided that right now.

113
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:25,233
- And then we'll see how smart you are.
- I like it. It's like a love story/mystery.

114
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:27,670
- Great. Sounds good. You ready?
- No.

115
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,798
No.

116
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,309
- Take your time.
- I will.

117
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:35,540
- I know you will.
- You go here.

118
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:37,606
- Princess pillow?
- Thank you.

119
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,344
- You bet.
- Okay.

120
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:48,784
I'm ready.

121
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,658
Once upon a time,

122
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:55,724
before e-mails and cell phones
and reality television shows,

123
00:08:56,636 --> 00:09:01,403
<i>in 1992 to be exact,
in a little town called Madison, Wisconsin,</i>

124
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:04,034
<i>there lived a young man
named William Hayes.</i>

125
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,705
- Hey, Will, man, Happy New Year.
- Hey, yeah, you, too.

126
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:13,013
<i>Now, this young man was deeply,
deeply in love with his college sweetheart.</i>

127
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:14,313
<i>Let's call her...</i>

128
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,014
- Emily!
- Emily!

129
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:17,683
Emily!

130
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:20,187
- Hey.
- Hi.

131
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:23,285
Ten, nine, eight...

132
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:28,459
Hey, guess who's gonna be the luckiest guy
on planet Earth in about four seconds?

133
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:29,831
You.

134
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,597
two, one!

135
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:33,605
Happy New Year!

136
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:35,607
<i>They were a perfect couple.</i>

137
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:38,610
<i>Except to really understand
how this young man</i>

138
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:40,839
<i>ended up marrying your mother,
you'll also need to know</i>

139
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:45,577
<i>that he had a very big,
incredibly embarrassing dream.</i>

140
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:47,084
All rise

141
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:52,952
for the President
of the United States of America,

142
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:55,550
William

143
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,259
Matthew

144
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,754
Hayes.

145
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,901
<i>You wanted to be President?</i>

146
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,365
I'm just, I don't understand why you have
to work for Clinton in New York.

147
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,307
Why can't you just work for him in Madison?

148
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,436
Well, because they don't need me here.
They need me in New York.

149
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:17,812
They need him, Em. Will's the man.
I can't believe you're letting him go.

150
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:19,783
I mean, don't you know
about New York girls?

151
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:22,218
Besides being incredibly hot,
they have no problem with casual sex,

152
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,381
which by the way, I totally respect.

153
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,721
- What if Charlie's right?
- Charlie's never right.

154
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:30,751
- He's functionally retarded.
- I am worried New York's gonna change you.

155
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,855
- Change can be good.
- If we change together.

156
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:35,628
So, we'll change together.

157
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:38,727
Okay? It's two months in New York.
I'll be back before you know it.

158
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:39,998
Besides, we have a plan, right?

159
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:43,508
The other thing I can't believe is that
you'd risk leaving Emily here with me,

160
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:47,603
'cause I gotta tell you,
I've always had a thing for you...

161
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,748
And I have absolutely no scruples.

162
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:56,780
Wait! I almost forgot.
You have to give this to Summer.

163
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:58,147
She's the only girl I know in New York.

164
00:10:58,224 --> 00:10:59,316
- I want you to meet her.
- Summer Hartley?

165
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:00,654
- Yes. Yes.
- That's her name?

166
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:02,455
She was on my exchange program
at Cambridge,

167
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:05,827
and all the guys wanted to sleep with her,
and you probably will, too.

168
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:07,058
Maybe you should mail it to her.

169
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:08,293
- That might be a better idea.
- No.

170
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:09,356
What is it?

171
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:12,768
Something I should have
sent her a long time ago.

172
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:15,330
I love you, William Hayes.

173
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:20,971
Okay. Go, go, go. Go be your brilliant self.

174
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:24,648
<i>Emily sounds like she would
make a good mom.</i>

175
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:27,515
<i>- I just don't know if she's my mom.
- Why not?</i>

176
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:28,883
<i>Everyone knows that the girlfriend</i>

177
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:31,855
<i>in the beginning of the story
always gets dumped.</i>

178
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:35,189
<i>Which means maybe
Summer Hartley is my mother.</i>

179
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,739
<i>I'll never forget that day.</i>

180
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:57,613
<i>There I was, arriving in the city
I always dreamed about</i>

181
00:11:57,683 --> 00:12:00,811
<i>to work on a campaign
that I believed in with all of my heart.</i>

182
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:04,378
<i>And on top of that,
I was positive that in just a few hours,</i>

183
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:07,426
<i>the campaign manager would realize
how brilliant I was.</i>

184
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:08,983
<i>And then I'd be writing speeches,</i>

185
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,188
<i>and then I'd be coming up with strategy,
and before long...</i>

186
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:12,628
Will Hayes?

187
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:14,393
- Hey. Gareth Henderson.
- You're Gareth.

188
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:17,095
- Hey, how are you?
- Nice to meet you. We're walking, Hayes.

189
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:21,435
I brought my C.V. and a sample of some
speeches I wrote for Congressman Sweeney.

190
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:25,466
Fantastic. I cannot wait to peruse these
in my abundant spare time.

191
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:28,638
In the meantime, here's a sample
of the coffee and bagel order

192
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:30,477
I'll need filled immediately.

193
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:31,709
Wait!

194
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:33,481
You want me to get coffee?

195
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:36,612
At some point in our lives, we all get coffee.
Your time's now. Come on.

196
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:37,747
We're still walking, Hayes.

197
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:40,485
Have the coffee here by 10:00,
or Arthur's gonna kill me!

198
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:43,528
That means I'm gonna have to kill you.
I've killed before, Hayes.

199
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,588
- You should know that.
- What is this?

200
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:48,257
That is a cellular telephone

201
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:51,633
so I can get a hold of you wherever,
whenever, for whatever.

202
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:54,730
- Can somebody get me an aspirin, please?
- Watch it!

203
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,968
Glad to have you aboard, Hayes!

204
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,304
- Hi.
- What? Hi.

205
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:05,282
Four weeks from now,
voters of New York State

206
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:09,014
will select their next Democratic nominee
for President.

207
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:11,348
Now, if Bill Clinton wins,

208
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:14,826
I want you to all understand
that it's gonna be as a direct result

209
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:18,853
of the commitment and the energy
of every person in this room.

210
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:21,333
And I mean that. That's just a fact.

211
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,494
Now, that's how important the work is.

212
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,504
That each and every one of you is...

213
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,800
What am I doing here?

214
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:34,873
It's the new guy.

215
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:39,847
- Hey.
- Hey, is that the toilet paper guy?

216
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:47,521
- Can I get a pack of Morley Red, please?
- 3.25.

217
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:51,786
3.25? These are $2.15
in Madison, Wisconsin.

218
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:53,229
So go back to Madison.

219
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:55,859
- Don't forget to write.
- That's right. Don't forget to write.

220
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:58,233
<i>Hold it! Stop. Stop right there!</i>

221
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:00,003
You smoked?

222
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:01,539
No. Yeah.

223
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:05,477
But I didn't mean to tell you that.

224
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:11,306
Listen. I was young, and I was stupid,
and I haven't smoked in years.

225
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:12,509
I promise you.

226
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:15,782
Is there anything else you should tell me?

227
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,255
Probably not.

228
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,698
- Can I get 10 copies?
- Put them on the pile.

229
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:29,233
No, they're for Arthur.
I need them like, 15 minutes ago.

230
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:31,428
So if you wouldn't mind...

231
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:33,328
You're the toilet paper guy.

232
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:36,863
<i>Wait. Who's that?
- That's April.</i>

233
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:40,702
Yes. I am, in fact, the toilet paper guy,

234
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:42,770
but feel free to call me
the bagel-and-coffee guy.

235
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:47,683
Or Todd in Accounting calls me Crystal,
which I'm pretty sure is a girl's name.

236
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:50,779
- How many copies?
- Ten. Please.

237
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:53,188
- These?
- Yeah, both of those.

238
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:56,451
What made you become
a Bill Clinton supporter?

239
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:59,156
I'm not. This is a money gig.
I get paid 12 an hour,

240
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:03,531
which is better than babysitting, which is
what I've been doing way too much of.

241
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:05,069
You're a Democrat, right?

242
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:08,538
Why does everyone have to be
a Democrat or a Republican?

243
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:09,869
I'm struggling with the copy machine.

244
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:12,206
No, hold on.
You're an Independent, aren't you?

245
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:15,611
I am nothing.
Why am I obligated to be something?

246
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:18,912
Why do I have to have an opinion
about everything anyway?

247
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:21,009
I mean, really,
what do I know about missile systems

248
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,316
or Social Security, or the tax code?

249
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:26,552
What about civil rights or women's rights?

250
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,923
A woman's right to do what she wants
with her body? What about that?

251
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:31,485
I do what I want with my body.

252
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:33,929
That's apathetic.

253
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:35,694
- I'm not apathetic.
- Yes, you are.

254
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:39,135
I'm not. I just know that these bozos
you're working for,

255
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:41,263
they don't care about anything more
than their own ambitions.

256
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,500
That's absolutely not true.

257
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:44,940
You think this guy, Bill Clinton,
is gonna make a huge difference?

258
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:47,001
- I do.
- He's gonna do what's already inevitable.

259
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:49,172
- Okay, that's where you're wrong.
- Don't make me staple your head!

260
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,682
You're wrong. He's gonna make
a difference with African Americans.

261
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,513
He's gonna make a difference with women.
He gets women.

262
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:55,246
- My God.
- I mean, look at his record in Arkansas.

263
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:58,083
Read his plans on health care.
Read his plans on education.

264
00:15:58,157 --> 00:15:59,749
- Okay, or don't. You know, yeah.
- Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

265
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:00,849
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
- I just fell asleep.

266
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:02,325
- I'm really sorry.
- Yeah. That's fine.

267
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:03,622
Wake up to a new America.

268
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,459
- I believe you.
- This has been really interesting.

269
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:08,796
- Fine. You convinced me. You're nothing.
- I'm nothing.

270
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:10,698
<i>So I'm here to repeat in front of all of you...</i>

271
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:13,670
Hey! Listen up! Look up, everybody!

272
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,173
<i>Yes, I was Bill Clinton's lover for 12 years.</i>

273
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:18,231
Hey, somebody turn it up.

274
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:22,406
<i>For the past two years, I have lied to the
press about our relationship to protect him.</i>

275
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,779
<i>The truth is, I loved him.</i>

276
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:28,778
<i>Now he tells me to deny it.</i>

277
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:34,884
<i>Well, I'm sick of all of the deceit,
and I'm sick of all of the lies.</i>

278
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:39,923
Well, you're right about one thing.
He certainly gets women.

279
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,127
- This has been fun. Yeah.
- Bye, toilet paper guy.

280
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:44,794
Bye, copy girl.

281
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:47,128
Oh, my God. It never ends.

282
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:49,106
They just keep playing it
over and over and over again.

283
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,505
It's gonna blow over.
- Right.

284
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:51,634
People don't really care about this stuff.

285
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,803
- That's the thing.
- What I don't understand,

286
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:56,177
I've heard Bush has a mistress.

287
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:59,547
Everybody's talking about it, so why
is it okay for him and not for Clinton?

288
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:00,915
She's trashy.

289
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,646
I mean, her hair alone
is enough reason to go after Clinton.

290
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:06,953
Big deal. Everyone has their weaknesses,
you know?

291
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,995
Those chubby redheads
with the long, fake fingernails?

292
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:12,530
- That's what Daddy likes.
- That's just nasty.

293
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:14,759
Gareth, you are unfailingly repugnant.

294
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:18,769
Hey. That is a coincidence. I love women
that say "unfailingly repugnant."

295
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:19,997
You know what I love?

296
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:22,302
I love long-haired brunettes
with horn-rimmed glasses.

297
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,535
I have no idea why.
They're like kryptonite to me.

298
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:25,941
I got that one, too.

299
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:29,276
I got a thing for guys
who've got a thing for me.

300
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,449
You might wanna look at that.
I'm gonna propose a toast.

301
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:34,076
I am fine with that.

302
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:36,314
- To Bill and his weaknesses.
- Yes.

303
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,650
- To Bill.
- To Bill.

304
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:45,921
<i>Hello?</i>

305
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:47,727
Hey! It's me!

306
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,461
- Is that Emily?
- Is that Emily?

307
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,526
- Hi, Emily!
- Hi, Emily!

308
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:52,763
<i>What's all that noise?</i>

309
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:56,467
Nothing. That's just a couple of idiots
I work with making fun of me

310
00:17:56,542 --> 00:18:01,104
because they don't have a beautiful
girlfriend that they're eternally devoted to!

311
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,238
<i>You're drunk.</i>

312
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:03,713
You're beautiful.

313
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:06,580
<i>- You're horny.
- You might be right.</i>

314
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,448
Emily? Come to New York.

315
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:13,320
You'll love it here.
It's the energy, the people. It's amazing.

316
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:17,522
<i>Whoa, did you just say "energy"?
Will, you did not just say "energy."</i>

317
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:18,824
What?

318
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,930
You're never coming back.

319
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,902
Hey, come on, now.
I just want you to come for a weekend.

320
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:29,063
You're right. I'm sorry.

321
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,306
Did you call Summer?

322
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:36,440
No. I left her a message.
She didn't get back to me.

323
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:41,413
Hey. You okay?

324
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,387
<i>Yeah. I'm just really lonely here,</i>

325
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:46,652
and I miss you like crazy,
and it's really hard.

326
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:50,354
Yeah. I know what you mean.

327
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:16,485
- Hey. What are you doing up?
- Mr. McCormack.

328
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:20,753
Come on, you've been staring
at that package for about a week now.

329
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:24,927
How was the rest of your evening?
Successful, I take it.

330
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:29,991
Oh, my goodness. I'm in big trouble.
I love this girl!

331
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,159
You know, that's usually a good thing.

332
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:35,035
It's hard enough to get elected
the first black President

333
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:37,940
without having Julia Roberts
on your arm at the inauguration.

334
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,945
That is an impressive mental leap, Russ,

335
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:44,779
going from a one-night stand
to being sworn in as President.

336
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,383
Open it.

337
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:50,546
I know you're dying to know what's inside.

338
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:54,422
Just her name alone, Summer Hartley,
is driving me...

339
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:57,189
Look it! You got a tear right there! I see it.

340
00:19:57,262 --> 00:20:00,129
Come on through. You can do it.

341
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,030
Thank you. Yes.

342
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:09,405
- It's a diary.
- Sweet Jesus. Let me see.

343
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:13,672
No! Stop! Stop right there.
We're not gonna read this. We can't.

344
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:18,780
"The boys' dorm is across
the quad, their windows visible from ours.

345
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:21,943
<i>"The evenings are hot and sticky.</i>

346
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:26,423
<i>"We are all half-dressed,
pretending we can't be seen by the boys.</i>

347
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:29,426
<i>"Some of us are bold. My new friend</i>

348
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,220
<i>"Emily is sweet</i>

349
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:37,328
<i>"and embarrassed by it all,
always waiting to see what I will do."</i>

350
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:42,700
Don't stop! This is good stuff.
Where were you? Okay.

351
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:47,311
<i>"It's our last night, and the plan has
been in place for days.</i>

352
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:49,904
<i>"Emily and I are the last to leave,</i>

353
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:54,681
<i>"and as we reach the stairs,
I grab Emily firmly by her wrist.</i>

354
00:20:54,753 --> 00:21:00,191
<i>"She looks up at me expectantly
and I know what will happen next."</i>

355
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,284
- Do you?
- I think I have a pretty good idea.

356
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:04,795
Oh, my goodness!

357
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:08,556
What are you doing?
This is good stuff, man!

358
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:11,994
Wait a minute.

359
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:15,270
Is that your Emily?

360
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:17,606
Good night, Russell!

361
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,211
She is a freak!

362
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,611
Put the picture back!

363
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,792
Wow.

364
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:46,463
Who is it?
- Will Hayes. I called earlier.

365
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:50,039
You a Jehovah's Witness?

366
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:51,370
No.

367
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:53,308
Christ, you're tall.

368
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:56,876
Hi.

369
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:09,526
- Come in.
- Okay.

370
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:11,653
Close the door behind you.

371
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:13,993
Lock it!

372
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:19,134
Summer said to hang tight.
She'll be back. She wants you to wait.

373
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:24,141
- What do you got in there?
- I don't know. Are you Summer's father?

374
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,778
Yeah. I'm her daddy.

375
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,452
- Drink?
- No. No. It's a little early for me.

376
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:47,054
Early. You're fresh off the boat, aren't you?

377
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:51,933
So tell me about yourself. What's your deal?
What do you aspire to?

378
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:55,234
What are your dreams?
What are your fancies?

379
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:57,969
What do you want to be when you grow up?

380
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,271
- Sit down!
- Okay.

381
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:00,743
What do you do now? You...

382
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:02,302
Wait, don't tell me.
You work for your daddy.

383
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,507
- No.
- No, don't tell me!

384
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:04,708
Wall Street. No!

385
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:07,877
You kiss ass to some fancy uptown law firm.

386
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:10,945
- Actually...
- No! I give up. What do you do?

387
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:14,583
I'm working for Bill Clinton.
He's running for President.

388
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:15,785
No.

389
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:17,788
I know who Bill Clinton is.

390
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:20,696
Yeah, in fact, I know more about Bill Clinton
than his own mother.

391
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:21,824
- Really?
- Yep.

392
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,528
- What do you do?
- What do I do?

393
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:25,934
I drink!

394
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:27,599
Drink!

395
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:29,974
Be a man.

396
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:35,009
There you go! Isn't that better?

397
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:37,345
Swallow!

398
00:23:39,217 --> 00:23:41,082
So tell me about Bill Clinton.

399
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:46,714
Hey. Wake up.

400
00:23:57,235 --> 00:23:58,998
You want some aspirin?

401
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:07,943
- You must be Will.
- Hi.

402
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:11,539
I see you drank my boyfriend
under the table.

403
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:15,745
He's not your father?
- Is that what he told you?

404
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:16,876
Hmm.

405
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:18,989
He's my thesis advisor.

406
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,079
Oh.

407
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:21,819
What else did he tell you?

408
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:25,260
He was telling me how to be a real man,
as opposed to the sort of

409
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:28,697
- boy-man I seem to be.
- Did you learn anything?

410
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:31,698
Yeah, there's a lot of drinking involved.

411
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:34,034
Also cursing and fighting.

412
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:35,470
- Sex?
- Yes.

413
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,371
Although that's not what we real men call it.

414
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:39,342
What do you call it?

415
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:44,776
I have something for you.
This is from Emily.

416
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:49,584
- Haven't talked to her in ages.
- We'll be moving in together in the fall.

417
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:50,848
Uh-huh.

418
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:54,284
Oh, please! Daddy.

419
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,693
Oh, come on! No.

420
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,258
Oh, this is...

421
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:14,673
Did you read this?

422
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:16,575
I didn't.

423
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,551
- I read a page.
- A page.

424
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:24,282
- Two pages at the most.
- Two?

425
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:27,382
And the part about you and Emily
touching each other and kissing.

426
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:32,691
- Oh! That part, yeah.
- Incredibly descriptive. I felt like I was there.

427
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:35,433
You're a great writer. I mean...

428
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,435
I think you should keep it.
You should read it when you're lonely.

429
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:42,701
- I can't. It's your diary, so I can't do that.
- No, really, really. I just, I don't need it.

430
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:44,867
I've already got it memorized,
so I'll just leave it on the table.

431
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:47,241
Keep a hard copy.
That might be nice for me.

432
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:52,544
I wonder why Emily gave it to you
to give to me.

433
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:53,709
Hmm.

434
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:57,084
Hampton?

435
00:25:57,756 --> 00:26:00,224
- Hampton?
- Are you gonna join us?

436
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:02,658
That's Hampton Roth.
He's an incredible writer.

437
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:05,821
- His book on the McGovern campaign is...
- Yeah.

438
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:08,966
- You...
- Yeah. We do.

439
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:13,198
Look, have you ever actually
had sex with a sexagenarian?

440
00:26:13,271 --> 00:26:16,263
- I haven't.
- Well, then you shouldn't really judge.

441
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:19,333
Well, actually, I'm not judging. Look at you.

442
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:22,710
You're beautiful. You're sophisticated.
You're a very talented writer.

443
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:23,805
Thank you.

444
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:26,214
I mean, to please a woman like you,
it would obviously take a...

445
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:28,013
- Real man.
- Exactly.

446
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:32,284
- Hard to compete with that.
- Well, unless you're the competitive type.

447
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:37,995
- Yep, nice to meet you.
- Yeah, it was great meeting you, too.

448
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:41,025
I feel horrible about taking the...

449
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:54,872
Sorry.

450
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:57,912
I was just curious.

451
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:01,949
Hampton encourages me
to cultivate my curiosity.

452
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,946
He says it's the key
to being a good journalist.

453
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:07,684
Yeah.

454
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:10,952
Summer! Daddy's hungry!

455
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,621
- Speak of the devil. Better go. Yeah.
- Hmm.

456
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:15,757
Where the hell are you?

457
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:17,495
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

458
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:21,327
Yeah, give us a call sometime.
We should all go out for dinner.

459
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:23,169
I'd... Yeah, I'd love dinner.

460
00:27:23,241 --> 00:27:24,674
- Yeah.
- Hey!

461
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:29,637
- Are you gonna call her?
- Are you insane?

462
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:31,944
- Well, what are you gonna do?
- What am I gonna do?

463
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:37,612
I'm gonna keep my eye on the ball.
Emily and I have a future. We have a plan.

464
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:39,589
Which may involve
some type of threesome now.

465
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,320
Or foursome
if that old dude is still in the picture.

466
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:44,225
You're not helping.

467
00:27:45,096 --> 00:27:49,692
I never should have opened that diary.
It's like Pandora's hot, sexy box.

468
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:51,933
<i>What's a threesome?</i>

469
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:53,834
- What?
- A threesome.

470
00:27:56,241 --> 00:28:00,268
That's a game that adults play sometimes
when they're bored.

471
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:06,015
Whatever. So what happened with Emily?

472
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:08,609
Nothing. I wanted to wait
till she came for a visit,

473
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:11,520
and then I decided to do
something really dramatic.

474
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:15,851
<i>It was just one week
before the primary, and I had graduated</i>

475
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:20,387
<i>from bagels and toilet paper
to signs and bumper stickers.</i>

476
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,192
Jesus! Mercy!

477
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,794
Hold, please.

478
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:29,630
What am I doing here?

479
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:37,973
Move over! Another foot!
Go, another foot. Move over!

480
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,210
Over, over, over!

481
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:48,354
Just want to let everyone know
that the new signs are ready.

482
00:28:48,426 --> 00:28:50,155
They're looking good.

483
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:52,253
I wrote three speeches
for Congressman Sweeney.

484
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:54,893
How's high school?

485
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:58,902
<i>He's from Texas. His name's George Bush.
But he is not the President.</i>

486
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:01,029
<i>Instead, he's the eldest son
of George and Barbara</i>

487
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:03,472
<i>and considered a key
political advisor of the White House.</i>

488
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:05,475
<i>Bryant, well, you forgot to mention
the Texas Rangers.</i>

489
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:06,567
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

490
00:29:06,644 --> 00:29:08,544
Man, if this guy's smart,
he'll go back to baseball.

491
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:09,978
- No kidding.
- Anybody see Hayes?

492
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:11,106
- No.
- No.

493
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:15,076
Hayes! Where is Hayes? Hayes!

494
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:18,521
Is it true you graduated first
of your class at Madison?

495
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,319
- Yeah.
- All right.

496
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:22,222
- Come on. We're walking.
- We're walking.

497
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:24,352
Here's a list of Madison graduates
in the New York area.

498
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,260
These people earn 200 grand plus a year.

499
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:29,789
We have a $10,000-a-plate fundraiser
on Monday with 15 empty tables.

500
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:32,336
I can't have that, Hayes.
I need you to sell five of them.

501
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:34,098
Hold on. No more coffee, bagels?

502
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:35,901
- We'll see how this goes, okay?
- Gareth.

503
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:39,671
- What?
- Thank you. I'm really happy right now.

504
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,609
- Okay, Hayes.
- Okay.

505
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,740
- There's the desk.
- Look at that. Yeah.

506
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:49,113
Yeah, that's funny, the toilet paper.

507
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:51,678
That's good because it's ironic.

508
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:54,657
Yeah, that's right, everybody. My desk.

509
00:29:55,326 --> 00:29:57,624
Right here, I got a desk, and I got a list.

510
00:29:57,695 --> 00:30:00,926
And I have a phone. And this empty basket.

511
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:02,364
No, no, no, I really don't agree

512
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:05,960
that the Governor has a character problem,
Mrs. Perleman.

513
00:30:06,037 --> 00:30:08,335
Did you know that
50% of Americans believe that

514
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:10,067
marijuana use should be legalized?

515
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:12,266
Hello?

516
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:15,278
No, no, no, he wasn't a draft dodger.

517
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:18,348
Besides, did you know that
the majority of Americans believe

518
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:21,510
that the Vietnam War
was just a terrible idea?

519
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:23,452
Both legs.

520
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:26,352
Wow, I am sorry. You must miss them.

521
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:33,763
Yes, I understand your concern,
but I think you should remember

522
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:38,801
that the Governor comes from
a town called Hope.

523
00:30:39,637 --> 00:30:42,970
And hope is exactly what he stands for, so...

524
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:46,702
No, no, I know it's corny, but I also think

525
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:50,714
that sometimes corny is exactly
what this country needs.

526
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,581
That would be wonderful. No, thank you.

527
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:57,018
Two seats.

528
00:30:57,655 --> 00:30:59,316
Okay, great. Thank you, Mr. Bishop.

529
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:03,687
Yeah, the dinner's next Thursday.

530
00:31:04,762 --> 00:31:06,525
Yes, when I spoke with Hillary this morning

531
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:11,297
she said that she wanted to get to know
our most important supporters.

532
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:14,067
No, I think you'd definitely
enjoy meeting her.

533
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:15,332
Yeah.

534
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:20,302
An entire table? No, that is very possible.

535
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:24,474
I'll put you down for one table, then.
That sounds great.

536
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,676
Okay, I look forward
to seeing you next Thursday.

537
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:28,480
Okay, thank you.

538
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:35,784
I just sold an entire table for $50,000.

539
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:44,100
That's my guy, Will. My guy.

540
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,609
Toilet paper guy! Toilet paper guy!

541
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:55,378
Good evening, gentlemen.
Pack of Reds, please.

542
00:31:55,446 --> 00:31:58,313
3.60. New tax and a new warning.

543
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:00,410
Christ.

544
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:03,585
Tell us the truth, my friend.

545
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:06,317
- Did that Clinton inhale or not?
- What does it matter?

546
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:09,758
That's like if your girlfriend catches you
in bed with another woman, then you say,

547
00:32:09,827 --> 00:32:11,055
<i>"But we didn't do it."</i>

548
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:14,360
- What, is that gonna matter to her?
- Yeah, it does. Hi.

549
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:17,966
- Hello.
- Pack of American Eagles, blue, please.

550
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:19,503
4.25.

551
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:23,199
4.25? You pay $4.25
for a pack of cigarettes?

552
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,208
They don't put as many chemicals in them.

553
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:28,006
- So those are healthy cigarettes.
- Something like that.

554
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:30,138
So if there's not as many chemicals in them,

555
00:32:30,214 --> 00:32:33,308
they should cost less, not more,
don't you think?

556
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:36,080
They put saltpeter in your cigarettes,

557
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:39,612
which make them burn faster,
which make you smoke more.

558
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:45,253
Which means, at the end of the day,
your cigarettes actually cost more, not less.

559
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:50,463
Copy girl,
what I think you're actually paying for

560
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:53,595
is the picture of the eagle
and the pretty pastel colors.

561
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:58,131
Some reassuring idea about your lifestyle.
The rest is pretty much crap.

562
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,610
- You wanna bet?
- Sure.

563
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:03,146
- 20 bucks.
- I got 20 bucks.

564
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:04,613
Easiest 20 bucks I ever made.

565
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:05,706
- Really?
- Yeah.

566
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:07,478
That's funny.
In a minute, I'll have 40.

567
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:10,817
Okay, we have to inhale at the same time
for the same amount of time.

568
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:13,379
- Yep.
- Ready, steady, go.

569
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:26,266
- It's my birthday today.
- Happy birthday.

570
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:37,844
Why aren't you out celebrating?

571
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:42,419
My boyfriend, Lucas, was taking me out
for dinner and then to a party.

572
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:47,186
But at last minute, he gets a gig in Philly,
which, of course, he takes 'cause...

573
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:57,796
Truth is he's far more interested in being

574
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:00,861
the next Kurt Cobain
than being my boyfriend.

575
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:03,000
Who's Kurt Cobain?

576
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:06,037
You're kidding me!

577
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:08,540
What?

578
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,677
Smoke.

579
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,209
Oh.

580
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:19,788
- Look at that.
- Look at that.

581
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:28,660
- All right.
- No, come on.

582
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,223
The satisfaction of me being right

583
00:34:30,301 --> 00:34:33,429
and you being wrong
is more than enough for me.

584
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:35,699
Well, I never welsh on a bet,
so I'll tell you what.

585
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:38,571
I'll take you out for dinner,
for a birthday dinner.

586
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:40,270
- What do you say?
- Like a date?

587
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:42,107
No, I didn't mean it like that.

588
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,579
<i>Like an "I feel sorry for you</i>

589
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:46,139
<i>"because it's your birthday
and you have no plans" dinner.</i>

590
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:48,879
- You know, one of those.
- Well, I'll tell you what.

591
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:50,944
You can take me to this party
I have to go to,

592
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:53,957
because there's no way
I can face going alone.

593
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:03,766
Yeah, I'm gonna go head over...

594
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:06,663
Whoa.

595
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:10,837
I think I'm a little out of my league here.

596
00:35:10,908 --> 00:35:12,739
Yes, you are.

597
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:20,512
So Emily is what, like,
your college sweetheart?

598
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:22,553
- It's amazing how you do that.
- What?

599
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,212
The way you take the simplest statement,

600
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,519
and then you twist it with
a completely negative connotation.

601
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:30,584
- It's really, actually, impressive. I'm amazed.
- I didn't mean to do that.

602
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:33,095
- But I understand. I get it.
- I actually think it's very sweet.

603
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:34,563
- See, you did it again.
- Really?

604
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,065
- Yeah.
- I don't even know I'm doing it.

605
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:39,297
It's probably hard for you to imagine
a relationship based on mutual respect

606
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:43,204
without even the slightest hint of
whatever you call it, masochism.

607
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:46,368
Well, if your deal with Emily
is so gosh darn wonderful,

608
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:48,241
then why don't you just marry her?

609
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:50,143
What's stopping you?

610
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:52,544
Nothing.

611
00:35:54,218 --> 00:35:55,549
- Wow.
- Wow.

612
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:00,488
She gets it tomorrow. I made a reservation

613
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:02,822
at some fancy French restaurant
on the Upper East Side.

614
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:06,125
Oh, my God. You're doing it
in front of a room full of strangers?

615
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:10,861
- Yeah, I am. What's wrong with that?
- No, nothing. I think it shows confidence.

616
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:11,993
What are you gonna say?

617
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:14,970
- I'm still working on it. I don't know.
- Oh, you should work on it with me.

618
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:19,567
You should practice with me.
I'm really good at that. I will be Emily.

619
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:24,047
I'm Emily, your college sweetheart.
Is there something you wanted to ask me?

620
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:26,379
- Emily...
- Wait! You've got to get down on your knee.

621
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:28,418
No, I'm not getting down on my knee.

622
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:31,011
She'll like it.
She'll like seeing you down on your knee.

623
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:36,151
- I'm not getting down on my knee.
- Such a mistake. Okay.

624
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,559
- Emily.
- Yes, William.

625
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:40,995
Don't make me laugh. Emily,

626
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:42,989
will you,

627
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:44,858
um,

628
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,171
marry me?

629
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:52,067
- No.
- Oh, my God.

630
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:53,974
<i>Well, what do you mean,
"Will you, um, marry me?"</i>

631
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,637
I haven't seen you in weeks!

632
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:58,841
You don't look happy or excited
about the prospect of our marriage!

633
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:02,818
You're asking me to give up my freedom,

634
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,286
<i>my joie de vivre</i>

635
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:06,949
for an institution that fails
as often as it succeeds?

636
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:10,858
And why should I marry you, anyway?
I mean, why do you wanna marry me?

637
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:14,386
Besides some bourgeois desire to fulfill
an ideal that society embeds in us

638
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:17,366
from an early age to promote
a consumer capitalist agenda?

639
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:18,459
Oh!

640
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:20,904
Oh, my God!

641
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:24,135
- You should've got on your knee!
- Just shut up!

642
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:27,474
Here.

643
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:31,304
I wanna marry you
because you're the first person

644
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:33,475
that I want to look at
when I wake up in the morning

645
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:36,179
and the only one I wanna kiss goodnight.

646
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:40,054
Because the first time
that I saw these hands,

647
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:43,351
I couldn't imagine
not being able to hold them.

648
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:47,090
But mainly, when you love someone
as much as I love you

649
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,032
getting married is the only thing left to do.

650
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,537
So will you...

651
00:37:57,541 --> 00:37:58,667
Um...

652
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:03,036
marry me?

653
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:06,144
Definitely. Maybe.

654
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,745
I have to think about it.

655
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:13,380
Walk me home?

656
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:26,828
- Do you want a cup of tea?
- Yeah. I'd love one.

657
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:31,302
Hey.

658
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:33,707
<i>How come you have so many copies
of Jane Eyre?</i>

659
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:36,542
- It's a long story.
- Really?

660
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:39,472
It seems to be about 300 pages or so.

661
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:43,011
Seriously, why?

662
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:48,190
For my 13th birthday,
I wanted a pair of gold stud earrings,

663
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:52,457
<i>and instead my dad bought me
a hardcover copy of Jane Eyre.</i>

664
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:56,796
And inside, he wrote a beautiful inscription,
which I could care less about at the time

665
00:38:56,867 --> 00:38:59,597
seeing as I was so pissed
about the earrings,

666
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:04,573
which was tragic as it turned out 'cause
it was the last present he ever gave me.

667
00:39:04,642 --> 00:39:06,041
What do you mean?

668
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:09,102
He died three weeks later in a car accident.

669
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:12,710
Jesus. That's awful.

670
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,083
I'm sorry.

671
00:39:15,419 --> 00:39:18,252
- Have you ever read it?
- No.

672
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:21,416
I read it every year or two.
Each time it's different.

673
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:23,790
It tells me different things.

674
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:29,698
Anyhow, when I went away to college,
my mom sold our house

675
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:32,600
<i>and somewhere along the way,
Jane Eyre got lost.</i>

676
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:35,935
Now, every time I pass
a second-hand bookstore,

677
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:38,998
I look for the copy that my dad
bought me for my birthday.

678
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,606
I know I'll never find it.

679
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:46,514
It's stupid, but it's become this,
like, weird superstitious little...

680
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:49,917
- It's not stupid.
- Thanks. Hobby.

681
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:52,722
What are all these?

682
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:57,021
Oh, these are the ones
I found that have inscriptions.

683
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:04,030
<i>"With love and hopes and dreams
of second chances. Alice."</i>

684
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:08,332
What is this?

685
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:12,206
This is Kurt Cobain.
This is Nirvana. Do you like it?

686
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:14,736
Yeah, I do.

687
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,113
You think it's ridiculous
that I want to be a politician, don't you?

688
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:20,946
- Yes.
- Thank you.

689
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:25,818
No, no, I get the whole politician thing.
It's easy to like you.

690
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:28,654
That's true. That's very true.

691
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:32,685
I just wonder if you want people
to like you a little too much.

692
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,031
That's also true.

693
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,999
I should want them to hate me.

694
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:40,093
I'm gonna start working on that right away.
You got any tips for me?

695
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:41,832
No, but you're off to a great start.

696
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:42,964
- Yeah?
- I'm hating you already.

697
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,132
Good.

698
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:45,766
What do you wanna be when you grow up?

699
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:48,107
I mean, you're too smart
to be making Xeroxes

700
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:49,510
- and babysitting.
- No.

701
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:52,606
- I don't know!
- Whatever else you do.

702
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:56,312
I don't know,
and I don't know how to know. You know?

703
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:01,054
You know what I really wanna do

704
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:04,925
is I wanna go to all those places
that I know nothing about.

705
00:41:06,063 --> 00:41:08,156
I've been saving money.

706
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:10,291
But I can't even get it together to do that.

707
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:12,835
Probably because I'm stuck in a rut
with this guy.

708
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:14,564
You should dump him.

709
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:19,507
I know that's none of my business,
but you're too good for him.

710
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:21,242
You are.

711
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,976
- You know what's really cool?
- I don't.

712
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:29,781
We can just sit here
and we don't have to worry about

713
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:34,086
- flirting or all the attraction stuff.
- All that stuff.

714
00:41:35,192 --> 00:41:36,523
Very cool.

715
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:38,187
Yeah.

716
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:56,876
I got to go.

717
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:02,316
Dumbass!

718
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:09,210
- Oh, God.
- There he is!

719
00:43:09,286 --> 00:43:13,052
- Told you he wouldn't be long.
- Hi! I wanted to surprise you!

720
00:43:13,123 --> 00:43:16,490
- I took the red-eye!
- That's incredible!

721
00:43:17,394 --> 00:43:22,559
I was just telling Emily how Arthur sent you
to Albany as part of the advance team.

722
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:24,624
- Advance team.
- Yeah. How'd it go?

723
00:43:24,702 --> 00:43:27,933
- How'd it go? Man, it went great!
- Great.

724
00:43:28,005 --> 00:43:29,495
- Great.
- Great.

725
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:33,669
- Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah, I was just getting a little exercise.

726
00:43:33,744 --> 00:43:35,473
- I ran up the stairs.
- Okay.

727
00:43:35,546 --> 00:43:39,915
I'm going to the office. It's...
Got a big day. Nice meeting you.

728
00:43:39,984 --> 00:43:41,076
- And you.
- Okay.

729
00:43:41,151 --> 00:43:42,311
Okay.

730
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:44,686
Good luck.

731
00:43:47,891 --> 00:43:49,358
- Hi.
- Hi.

732
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:52,721
- Here.
- Yeah.

733
00:43:54,865 --> 00:43:56,127
Hey.

734
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:07,538
- It's weird. Your tongue tastes different.
- What?

735
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:09,870
It tastes different, your tongue.

736
00:44:09,947 --> 00:44:13,576
- That is weird.
- It's not bad. It's just different.

737
00:44:14,785 --> 00:44:17,049
Maybe it's the tap water here.

738
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:20,522
Or the pH balance...
I don't know what I'm talking about.

739
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:23,492
Told you New York was gonna change you.

740
00:44:24,795 --> 00:44:27,059
- Could we maybe go for a walk?
- Yeah.

741
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:29,497
- Just to get some air?
- Yeah, you could see New York.

742
00:44:29,566 --> 00:44:30,760
I would love that.

743
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:32,760
So, did I ever tell you...
- I was gonna...

744
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:34,963
- Oh, sorry. No, go.
- What?

745
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:41,441
I was gonna say, did I ever tell you
about the day my dad proposed to my mom?

746
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:43,003
No.

747
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:47,279
Well, Dad was on his way
to meet my mom to propose,

748
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:51,651
and he runs into his ex-girlfriend,
Caroline Hopper.

749
00:44:52,723 --> 00:44:55,191
And they're talking,
they're looking at each other,

750
00:44:55,259 --> 00:44:57,193
and all these old feelings,
they start coming up.

751
00:44:57,261 --> 00:44:59,388
And he's thinking,

752
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:03,759
<i>"I could run away right now
with Caroline Hopper,</i>

753
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:05,529
<i>"be a happy man.</i>

754
00:45:05,602 --> 00:45:07,695
<i>"All I have to do is kiss her."</i>

755
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:10,831
But instead, he looks up,

756
00:45:13,777 --> 00:45:17,213
and he sees my mom
walking around the corner.

757
00:45:17,948 --> 00:45:21,349
And that moment he knows
that he had no reason to be afraid.

758
00:45:21,418 --> 00:45:23,079
You understand?

759
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:28,720
Am I Caroline Hopper in this story
or your mom?

760
00:45:30,094 --> 00:45:31,288
Oh, my God! I'm your mom!

761
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:33,158
- Emily, when I saw you this morning...
- Will, please.

762
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,595
...I knew...
- Put that back in your pocket.

763
00:45:34,665 --> 00:45:36,189
- Just stand up, Will. Stop.
...with absolute clarity.

764
00:45:36,266 --> 00:45:37,563
- Wait, wait, wait.
- I have no reason to be afraid.

765
00:45:37,634 --> 00:45:38,931
- Let's think about this.
- I'm not afraid of this.

766
00:45:39,002 --> 00:45:40,264
It's just like the day that my...

767
00:45:40,337 --> 00:45:41,497
Will!

768
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:43,470
I slept with Charlie!

769
00:45:50,447 --> 00:45:52,608
I thought we had a plan.

770
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:57,013
Well, you had a plan, Will.
You have a really big plan!

771
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:59,078
- Pretty sure we both had that plan.
- I just can't keep pretending

772
00:45:59,156 --> 00:46:00,817
- that I want to be part of it anymore.
- You were there

773
00:46:00,891 --> 00:46:02,518
- when we made it.
- And I didn't know how to tell you.

774
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:03,855
How do you tell someone
that you care about

775
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:05,019
that you don't want the same things

776
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,494
- they want anymore?
- The best way?

777
00:46:06,563 --> 00:46:09,361
Definitely having sex with the roommate.

778
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:13,803
It was cowardly, and I'm sorry.

779
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:15,600
Oh, good.

780
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,441
You're killing me.

781
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:28,984
No, I'm not. I'm letting you go.

782
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,979
'Cause if we stay together, Will,
we're gonna be miserable.

783
00:46:32,055 --> 00:46:33,283
I'm gonna hold you back from all these...

784
00:46:33,357 --> 00:46:36,622
- That's not true.
...incredible dreams that you have.

785
00:46:36,693 --> 00:46:39,526
And then, eventually,
you're totally gonna hate me for it.

786
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:40,858
- No.
- Yes.

787
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:44,128
Will, I don't want that,
and you don't want that.

788
00:46:45,035 --> 00:46:46,434
Trust me.

789
00:46:51,074 --> 00:46:53,975
You're gonna be just fine, Mr. Hayes,

790
00:46:54,912 --> 00:46:56,573
without me.

791
00:46:57,981 --> 00:46:59,073
Wow.

792
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,777
Yeah.

793
00:47:01,752 --> 00:47:02,878
Wow.

794
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:06,818
<i>Here is Tom Brokaw in New York.</i>

795
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:09,484
<i>Good evening. Bill Clinton may have
been wounded in New York,</i>

796
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,391
<i>but the big question tonight is,
to what degree?</i>

797
00:47:11,461 --> 00:47:14,862
<i>Because, after all, he is the big survivor,
indeed, the victor</i>

798
00:47:14,932 --> 00:47:18,390
<i>in the New York primary
and by a comfortable margin.</i>

799
00:47:33,617 --> 00:47:36,142
<i>Goes 'round the moon</i>

800
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:41,387
<i>I see the passion in your eyes</i>

801
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:46,361
<i>Sometimes it's all a big surprise</i>

802
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:50,696
<i>'Cause there was a time when all I did</i>

803
00:48:04,581 --> 00:48:06,310
Hey.

804
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:08,312
Congratulations.

805
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:11,354
I hear they asked you to stay on.
You must be very happy.

806
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:15,323
Yeah, yeah, he did, and I am.
Very, very happy.

807
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:17,952
Really? Why do I feel
like I should hide the razor blades?

808
00:48:18,028 --> 00:48:19,689
And the staplers and those scissors?

809
00:48:19,763 --> 00:48:23,460
I'll be fine. But this song,
it's an excellent cure for the will to live.

810
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:26,593
I know. What about the dancing?
Make that end.

811
00:48:29,873 --> 00:48:32,637
I'm sorry about the other night.

812
00:48:32,709 --> 00:48:35,542
It's okay. I just didn't think
that Lucas would approve.

813
00:48:35,612 --> 00:48:38,479
- Or Emily, for that matter.
- Well.

814
00:48:38,548 --> 00:48:42,382
Besides, you and me,
it'd kind of be like cats and dogs.

815
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:44,747
Yeah. Yeah.

816
00:48:46,156 --> 00:48:49,683
- Oil and water.
- Sandpaper and bare ass.

817
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,887
- That's gross. That's just gross.
- You'd be the ass.

818
00:48:51,962 --> 00:48:53,054
Yeah. No, thank you.

819
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:54,461
- I'd be honored.
- Lennon and McCartney.

820
00:48:54,531 --> 00:48:56,158
- They were good together.
- Yeah, while it lasted,

821
00:48:56,233 --> 00:48:58,929
and then they couldn't even be friends.

822
00:49:00,504 --> 00:49:04,270
- I think we can, at least, manage that.
- I think we could.

823
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:09,402
<i>- Enchant.
- Yeah. Salud.</i>

824
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,384
- Come on, let's dance.
- No.

825
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:16,942
- Why?
- Okay.

826
00:49:23,527 --> 00:49:25,927
You ready?
- Yeah.

827
00:49:36,206 --> 00:49:38,071
Guess that's it for Emily.

828
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:42,134
I can't believe that
she rehearsed with Charlie.

829
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:48,107
- I can't believe it, either.
- That leaves April. Maybe Summer.

830
00:49:48,185 --> 00:49:50,415
- Anybody else?
- I was too busy.

831
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:52,853
I was too busy working on the campaign.

832
00:49:52,923 --> 00:49:54,584
Anyway, when Clinton got elected,

833
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:55,886
<i>Russell and I started our own
consulting firm,</i>

834
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:59,722
<i>and we worked on campaigns for everybody.</i>

835
00:49:59,796 --> 00:50:01,286
<i>City council, state senate.</i>

836
00:50:01,365 --> 00:50:03,356
We even did one for the local dog catcher.

837
00:50:03,433 --> 00:50:07,335
That's very interesting, Dad,
but what about girlfriends?

838
00:50:07,404 --> 00:50:10,396
- What about Mom?
- Well, I started dating again.

839
00:50:10,474 --> 00:50:14,205
- But nothing serious.
- What about April? What happened to her?

840
00:50:14,277 --> 00:50:17,906
Well, a week after Kurt Cobain died,
she broke up with her boyfriend.

841
00:50:17,981 --> 00:50:19,448
<i>She went traveling.</i>

842
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:22,417
<i>She traveled all over the world,
just like she always dreamed of doing.</i>

843
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:26,149
<i>And she says
that it was because of something</i>

844
00:50:26,223 --> 00:50:28,088
<i>that I said to her on her birthday.</i>

845
00:50:28,158 --> 00:50:31,150
<i>Anyway, we started writing postcards.
We started writing letters.</i>

846
00:50:31,228 --> 00:50:34,561
<i>And before I knew it, even though
we were separated by entire worlds,</i>

847
00:50:34,631 --> 00:50:36,656
<i>we became great friends.</i>

848
00:50:41,238 --> 00:50:44,571
<i>It was 1994,
and New York was full of new life.</i>

849
00:50:44,641 --> 00:50:46,370
<i>More jobs, more money.</i>

850
00:50:46,443 --> 00:50:49,935
<i>That was the start of the Internet.
And overnight, everyone in Manhattan</i>

851
00:50:50,013 --> 00:50:51,002
<i>had a cell phone.</i>

852
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:52,105
Can you hear me now?

853
00:50:52,182 --> 00:50:54,013
<i>Which they never put down.</i>

854
00:50:55,886 --> 00:51:01,552
<i>And then, our old boss, Arthur Robredo
gave Russell and me our first big break.</i>

855
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:03,217
- This just came for you.
- Thanks.

856
00:51:03,293 --> 00:51:07,423
<i>I had finally made it inside the room.</i>

857
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,195
- Gareth.
- Hayes.

858
00:51:09,266 --> 00:51:10,528
Good morning.

859
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,261
Hey, let's get this party started.

860
00:51:12,969 --> 00:51:14,334
What's the word from upstate?

861
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:17,168
<i>For the first time,
New York was coming to me,</i>

862
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,401
<i>instead of the other way around.</i>

863
00:51:19,476 --> 00:51:22,809
<i>"The most endangered species in our nation</i>

864
00:51:22,879 --> 00:51:25,712
<i>"isn't a big woodpecker
or some freshwater fish.</i>

865
00:51:25,782 --> 00:51:28,478
<i>"It's the tongue in our heads!</i>

866
00:51:28,552 --> 00:51:32,283
<i>"Listen to the truncated
bastard language of today.</i>

867
00:51:32,355 --> 00:51:35,256
<i>"The average vocabulary is a third
of what it was 100 years ago.</i>

868
00:51:35,325 --> 00:51:39,762
<i>"Words fall out of our mouths
and die at our feet!</i>

869
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:42,890
<i>"The landscape of vocabulary
is being hacked down</i>

870
00:51:42,966 --> 00:51:46,663
<i>"and grubbed up by the dribble
of pop culture,</i>

871
00:51:46,736 --> 00:51:48,226
<i>"poisoned by lazy obscenity..."</i>

872
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:49,363
Will?

873
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:51,168
<i>"... infantilized by
a youth-obsessed media..."</i>

874
00:51:51,241 --> 00:51:52,936
- Hey.
- Hey.

875
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:58,543
It's my favorite man-boy.
You look very manly.

876
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:02,051
Well, thank you, thank you. That's the aim.

877
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:05,287
- How's Emily?
- Emily.

878
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:09,119
She's starring in
somebody else's diary now.

879
00:52:09,226 --> 00:52:10,215
Oh.

880
00:52:10,694 --> 00:52:14,994
- How's the Professor?
- The Professor is wonderful.

881
00:52:15,065 --> 00:52:18,364
- He's funny.
- He dumped me for a sophomore.

882
00:52:19,202 --> 00:52:21,534
Told me it was for my own good.

883
00:52:22,506 --> 00:52:25,737
Everybody seems to be
using that line these days.

884
00:52:27,577 --> 00:52:29,511
What have you been up to?

885
00:52:30,547 --> 00:52:35,814
<i>I'm writing these really dumb items
for New York Magazine.</i>

886
00:52:35,886 --> 00:52:37,717
Waiting for my big break.

887
00:52:37,787 --> 00:52:41,951
<i>"And 'syntax' isn't
what Nevada brothels pay the IRS."</i>

888
00:52:43,193 --> 00:52:45,559
- I'm gonna go listen to the Professor.
- Sure.

889
00:52:45,629 --> 00:52:46,687
Nice glasses.

890
00:52:46,763 --> 00:52:49,561
"Listen to your kids if you can."

891
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:51,760
Thank you.
- Scotch, rocks, please.

892
00:52:52,602 --> 00:52:55,162
William Hayes!

893
00:52:57,107 --> 00:52:59,405
From... Don't tell me!

894
00:52:59,476 --> 00:53:02,639
Wisconsin! Yes, the Cheese State.

895
00:53:04,781 --> 00:53:06,373
Very nice of you
to come to our little shindig.

896
00:53:06,449 --> 00:53:07,814
- I'll have another, please.
- Pleasure.

897
00:53:07,884 --> 00:53:12,082
Yeah. Summer tells me you're writing
speeches now for Arthur Robredo?

898
00:53:12,155 --> 00:53:16,421
- She tells me you're dating a sophomore.
- No. Actually, it's two freshmen,

899
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:19,929
which, on a good day,
add up to a sophomore, I suppose.

900
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:24,759
Walk with me. Why would you
wanna work for a hack like Arthur Robredo?

901
00:53:24,834 --> 00:53:30,466
As I recall from our first encounter,
you're a man of principles and ideals, even.

902
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:35,475
Don't tell me you're just another
yuppie puppy in an Armani suit.

903
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:39,208
You were wonderful, darling.
Is he being nice? You being nice?

904
00:53:39,282 --> 00:53:42,251
- Nice? Yeah, he can handle himself.
- Sure, I can handle myself.

905
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:45,846
First of all, Arthur Robredo is not a hack.
He's worked his way up from the streets.

906
00:53:45,922 --> 00:53:48,049
He was a cop, an entrepreneur.

907
00:53:48,491 --> 00:53:52,052
He's a putz.
This is exactly what my book is about.

908
00:53:52,128 --> 00:53:54,028
Here. Read it. It's free.

909
00:53:54,998 --> 00:53:59,196
Beauty, ideals,
love don't mean squat anymore.

910
00:53:59,269 --> 00:54:02,067
- It's all about power and money.
- I've read every single one of your books,

911
00:54:02,138 --> 00:54:04,197
and you're completely obsessed
with power and money.

912
00:54:04,274 --> 00:54:06,765
That's because he doesn't have any.
Right, babe?

913
00:54:06,843 --> 00:54:09,368
Babe, I am about the love.

914
00:54:09,446 --> 00:54:10,811
- As you know.
- Yes.

915
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:11,904
That's why you keep me around.

916
00:54:11,982 --> 00:54:15,713
To keep that rampant,
rapacious ambition of yours in check.

917
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:18,949
I have a thought.

918
00:54:19,456 --> 00:54:24,120
Why don't you use that newly acquired
scintilla of power and influence

919
00:54:24,194 --> 00:54:29,222
to get Summer here
to write an article about your man Robredo?

920
00:54:29,299 --> 00:54:32,496
That way Summer gets a break,
and you get the word out.

921
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:34,628
- What do you get, Hampton?
- Yeah.

922
00:54:35,505 --> 00:54:39,999
I guess it's the love. More of the love.
Yeah, that's what I'm about.

923
00:54:40,076 --> 00:54:41,270
More love.

924
00:54:41,344 --> 00:54:43,608
I knew Summer would be back.
- Did you?

925
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,739
You know what? At first,
I didn't want Summer to be my mom.

926
00:54:45,815 --> 00:54:48,375
But now I'm kinda liking her.
Did you ask her out on a date?

927
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:49,440
Uh-uh.

928
00:54:49,552 --> 00:54:52,953
I wanted to, but I couldn't
'cause she was writing the article.

929
00:55:14,444 --> 00:55:19,541
- Wow. This is pretty good.
- Will, this is really good.

930
00:55:24,954 --> 00:55:26,922
<i>Are you sure
it didn't seem like a puff piece?</i>

931
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:29,515
No, it's perfect. It's absolutely...

932
00:55:29,592 --> 00:55:33,528
You know, there's one part, though,
that kind of bothered me.

933
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:35,021
<i>"William Hayes,</i>

934
00:55:35,098 --> 00:55:40,195
<i>"Robredo's chief speech writer,
is both intense and boyishly handsome."</i>

935
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:42,631
- Boyishly? I mean...
- Yeah.

936
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,774
You know, I originally wrote,

937
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:49,334
<i>"William Hayes has seductive eyes
and the intriguing looks of someone</i>

938
00:55:49,412 --> 00:55:51,710
<i>"whose clothes you wanna rip
from his very body,"</i>

939
00:55:51,781 --> 00:55:54,875
but the editor made me change it.

940
00:55:54,951 --> 00:55:57,613
There's just no room for truth in journalism.

941
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:00,914
Did you always want to be a journalist?

942
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:05,927
No. Until I was 16, I wanted to be an actress.
I wanted to sing on Broadway.

943
00:56:05,995 --> 00:56:07,519
Wow. Really?

944
00:56:07,597 --> 00:56:10,395
Yeah, really. Is that hard to believe?

945
00:56:10,467 --> 00:56:14,870
Well, aren't actresses needy and emotional
and, you know, insecure?

946
00:56:14,938 --> 00:56:15,927
That sort of thing.

947
00:56:16,005 --> 00:56:19,406
What are you saying? That I don't need?
That I don't have emotions?

948
00:56:19,476 --> 00:56:21,171
- I'm an incredibly needy person.
- I'm not saying that.

949
00:56:21,244 --> 00:56:22,575
- I'm a very needy person.
- You know what I'm saying?

950
00:56:22,645 --> 00:56:25,273
I'm saying I would love to hear a song.

951
00:56:25,782 --> 00:56:27,750
- I'm sorry?
- Give us a song.

952
00:56:28,818 --> 00:56:31,286
- You want me to sing you a song?
- Why not?

953
00:56:33,089 --> 00:56:35,580
- You have a favorite?
- Yes.

954
00:56:35,658 --> 00:56:37,216
- You do?
- Yeah.

955
00:56:40,196 --> 00:56:41,185
Okay.

956
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:48,360
<i>How glad the many millions</i>

957
00:56:48,438 --> 00:56:52,738
<i>Of Timothys and Williams would be</i>

958
00:56:52,809 --> 00:56:55,209
- I'm a William.
- Don't interrupt.

959
00:56:55,278 --> 00:56:57,439
<i>To capture me</i>

960
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:01,175
<i>But you had such persistence</i>

961
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:04,049
<i>You wore down my resistance</i>

962
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:05,883
<i>I fell</i>

963
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:08,955
<i>And it was swell</i>

964
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:15,523
Wow.

965
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:18,089
Will you please put it on?

966
00:57:21,571 --> 00:57:23,766
You know, it really isn't so bad.

967
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,741
You know what the funny part is?
It's $1,000.

968
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:35,608
<i>I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie</i>

969
00:57:35,685 --> 00:57:37,710
Frank Sinatra, Linda Ronstadt.

970
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:39,049
- Why?
- A whole bunch of these.

971
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:44,253
Well, if you look on the back,
they all have one common song, which is...

972
00:57:44,327 --> 00:57:46,887
<i>- I've Got A Crush On You.
- Every one of them.</i>

973
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:51,532
- How's it going?
- Still got a lot to do.

974
00:57:53,102 --> 00:57:55,093
Yeah, me, too.

975
00:57:58,741 --> 00:58:00,709
- Yeah, I'm about done.
- Yeah, me, too.

976
00:58:00,777 --> 00:58:06,181
<i>The world will pardon my mush</i>

977
00:58:06,683 --> 00:58:13,486
<i>'Cause I've got a crush, my baby, on...</i>

978
00:58:40,383 --> 00:58:42,044
Was I snoring?

979
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:43,845
Uh-uh.

980
00:58:49,158 --> 00:58:51,456
You know what I've never done?

981
00:58:52,395 --> 00:58:53,589
What?

982
00:58:54,898 --> 00:58:58,493
I've never spent the whole day in bed
with a really great guy.

983
00:58:58,835 --> 00:58:59,995
Me, neither.

984
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:03,365
I'm serious.

985
00:59:03,439 --> 00:59:06,670
I always think of something
more important to do.

986
00:59:06,743 --> 00:59:08,677
I'm a workaholic.

987
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:11,740
It's really bad.

988
00:59:16,019 --> 00:59:18,817
Will you spend
the whole day in bed with me?

989
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:21,884
We do nothing.

990
00:59:28,698 --> 00:59:29,722
Oh.

991
00:59:39,876 --> 00:59:42,970
<i>Hi, this is Summer. Please leave a message,
and I will call you back.</i>

992
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:45,578
<i>This is Dr. Levenstein</i>

993
00:59:45,648 --> 00:59:48,344
<i>from the Columbia Presbyterian
emergency room. We have...</i>

994
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:50,579
Emergency room? Hello?

995
00:59:50,887 --> 00:59:54,846
- Mr. Roth has had an aortal rupture.
- What does that mean exactly?

996
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:57,392
Think of it like a tire blowing out
on the highway

997
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:59,860
after going too fast for way too long.

998
01:00:02,498 --> 01:00:05,399
How's that, Mr. Roth? Are you comfortable?

999
01:00:05,468 --> 01:00:06,799
I make a living.

1000
01:00:09,372 --> 01:00:13,536
Come on, sweetheart, give me a smile.
I've waited my whole life to do that joke.

1001
01:00:15,378 --> 01:00:16,902
Poor Hampton.

1002
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:18,604
Ow!

1003
01:00:18,681 --> 01:00:20,672
Summer's come.

1004
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:26,482
- What's he doing here?
- Hello, Hampton.

1005
01:00:26,556 --> 01:00:27,716
Hello.

1006
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:33,324
One thing they've left intact.

1007
01:00:33,396 --> 01:00:35,762
No, no, no, no, no, no,
don't mention grassroots.

1008
01:00:35,832 --> 01:00:36,821
Don't mention osmosis.

1009
01:00:36,899 --> 01:00:39,197
It's killing me
that you're going out with the kid.

1010
01:00:39,268 --> 01:00:43,864
Really? It's not the booze
or the cigarettes or the sophomores?

1011
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:46,807
- That has nothing to do with this.
- Nothing to do with it.

1012
01:00:46,876 --> 01:00:51,279
Listen, I want you to know
I've donated my organs to medical science

1013
01:00:51,347 --> 01:00:53,679
except for one, which is for you.

1014
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:59,783
- Sweetie, that's so kind.
- No, no, not that.

1015
01:00:59,856 --> 01:01:02,188
My heart, stupid.

1016
01:01:05,461 --> 01:01:08,658
Please tell me you're not in love with him.

1017
01:01:08,731 --> 01:01:10,460
I can't do that.

1018
01:01:14,303 --> 01:01:17,830
Can I have a cigarette?
Just a dying man's last request.

1019
01:01:17,907 --> 01:01:21,809
Not happening.
God, you're such a drama queen.

1020
01:01:21,878 --> 01:01:23,539
Nobody's dying.

1021
01:01:25,915 --> 01:01:28,850
What do you care
if I'm in love with him, huh?

1022
01:01:28,918 --> 01:01:30,943
You're the one who set us up, remember?

1023
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:33,853
Yeah, well, I kind of figured
you'd chew him up and spit him out.

1024
01:01:33,923 --> 01:01:37,256
You're such a sweetie.
You're a sweet guy, you know that?

1025
01:01:38,327 --> 01:01:41,319
- I read the Robredo piece.
- Yeah.

1026
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:45,660
The guy's been in New York politics
for over 20 years

1027
01:01:45,735 --> 01:01:50,331
and all you can dig up
is that his daughter had an eating disorder?

1028
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:52,705
What are you saying, Hampton?

1029
01:01:54,343 --> 01:01:55,810
Do your job.

1030
01:02:04,087 --> 01:02:07,147
I can't believe
we're finally gonna meet the President.

1031
01:02:07,857 --> 01:02:10,325
- Look at that.
- Look at it.

1032
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:12,884
We've come a long way
from that hotel room on 8th Avenue.

1033
01:02:12,962 --> 01:02:14,395
Thank you very much.

1034
01:02:14,464 --> 01:02:16,989
I don't believe it! I don't believe it!

1035
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:19,830
Which idiot forgot to check the menus
and the programs?

1036
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:22,166
There's no union seal
on the menus or the programs.

1037
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:23,262
Are you serious?

1038
01:02:23,339 --> 01:02:24,931
The hotel workers won't let anybody
into the building.

1039
01:02:25,007 --> 01:02:26,372
The Teamsters
won't set up the satellite feed!

1040
01:02:26,442 --> 01:02:28,171
Has anyone seen Robert Klein?

1041
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:29,711
I was with him like an hour ago.
Now he's gone.

1042
01:02:29,779 --> 01:02:31,269
I think he was completely plastered.

1043
01:02:31,347 --> 01:02:32,905
How are we supposed to know
where Robert Klein is?

1044
01:02:32,982 --> 01:02:35,416
You're not gonna believe this,
but there's a hailstorm in Chicago.

1045
01:02:35,485 --> 01:02:36,782
Who cares about Chicago?

1046
01:02:36,853 --> 01:02:38,787
We do.
The President's coming in from Chicago.

1047
01:02:38,855 --> 01:02:40,447
- Okay, okay.
- We can't worry about that right now.

1048
01:02:40,523 --> 01:02:42,491
Let me ask you a question.
How could you let this happen?

1049
01:02:42,558 --> 01:02:44,992
- What? What are you talking about?
- Why are you jumping down her throat?

1050
01:02:45,061 --> 01:02:47,086
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Guys, guys, guys, guys, hey!

1051
01:02:47,163 --> 01:02:50,997
Hey, deep breath, okay?
Look, let's just ask the hotel,

1052
01:02:51,067 --> 01:02:53,001
see if we can use the Internet connection
and find a printer.

1053
01:02:53,069 --> 01:02:54,593
- I'll call Klein's agent.
- Great.

1054
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:56,103
Gareth, have a drink.

1055
01:02:56,172 --> 01:02:58,663
You, I don't know who you are,
but your fly's down.

1056
01:02:58,741 --> 01:03:01,369
Be great if you wore underwear.
I'm gonna go check the weather in Chicago.

1057
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:05,471
Table seven's up. Six pasta. Two fish.
Get it out the door, now!

1058
01:03:09,152 --> 01:03:10,642
He may not be in your union,

1059
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:13,280
but he still happens to be
the President of the United States.

1060
01:03:13,356 --> 01:03:14,755
Remember him? So if I was you,

1061
01:03:14,824 --> 01:03:16,758
- I'd get your men off that truck and in this...
- Gareth!

1062
01:03:16,826 --> 01:03:19,386
You can't talk to a Teamster like that!
Come on.

1063
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:20,793
- This guy...
- Everything's gonna be fine.

1064
01:03:20,863 --> 01:03:21,887
Look, look, check it out.

1065
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:23,363
I downloaded a copy of the union seal.

1066
01:03:23,432 --> 01:03:25,024
If you could just please
paste it onto a menu,

1067
01:03:25,101 --> 01:03:28,127
make 500 copies, use a union shop.
We're gonna be home free, here.

1068
01:03:28,204 --> 01:03:30,365
Copies? You want me to make copies?

1069
01:03:32,842 --> 01:03:35,504
Well, at some point, we all make copies.
Your time is now.

1070
01:03:35,578 --> 01:03:37,603
That's not funny, Hayes. That's very...

1071
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:40,046
Yeah, that's real mature.
Where are you going?

1072
01:03:40,116 --> 01:03:42,346
I'm walking! Back in half an hour.

1073
01:03:42,418 --> 01:03:44,079
What a dick.

1074
01:03:46,722 --> 01:03:48,280
<i>- Yeah.
- William Hayes?</i>

1075
01:03:48,357 --> 01:03:49,517
Speaking.

1076
01:03:49,592 --> 01:03:52,083
<i>I'm watching you right now.</i>

1077
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:55,426
<i>And I know all about you
and your friend Robredo.</i>

1078
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:58,831
<i>In fact, I know so much,
I could bring you both down.</i>

1079
01:03:58,901 --> 01:04:00,232
Really?

1080
01:04:01,537 --> 01:04:05,132
<i>- Who am I speaking with?
- Why don't we meet, and you'll find out?</i>

1081
01:04:06,142 --> 01:04:08,337
<i>- Where are you?
- I'm close by.</i>

1082
01:04:09,078 --> 01:04:13,572
I don't have a lot of experience with
whatever this is.

1083
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:15,940
<i>You're getting warm.</i>

1084
01:04:17,753 --> 01:04:19,084
<i>You're hot.</i>

1085
01:04:19,989 --> 01:04:21,479
<i>You're hot.</i>

1086
01:04:21,557 --> 01:04:23,889
You are so hot!

1087
01:04:26,495 --> 01:04:27,587
I got you!

1088
01:04:29,098 --> 01:04:30,656
I thought you were gone
through the summer.

1089
01:04:30,733 --> 01:04:33,896
No, I thought so, too,
but this crazy thing happened.

1090
01:04:33,970 --> 01:04:37,098
I mean, I was camping
on this beautiful beach in Crete

1091
01:04:37,173 --> 01:04:40,734
with all these really cool people,
and there was this guy that I liked, Paco,

1092
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:44,177
brooding and sexy,
monosyllabic and totally my type.

1093
01:04:44,247 --> 01:04:47,148
One night I'm dancing with Paco
and he kisses me,

1094
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:49,810
- an incredible, deep kiss.
- Spare me the details.

1095
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:52,320
- And what do I do?
- I don't know. What'd you do?

1096
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:53,650
I start crying.

1097
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:56,157
- I mean, tears are rolling down my cheeks...
- Of course you start crying.

1098
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:59,683
...which he doesn't notice 'cause, of course,
his hands are all over my body,

1099
01:04:59,762 --> 01:05:02,322
which felt nice,
which made me feel even more upset,

1100
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:03,956
'cause in a flash

1101
01:05:04,033 --> 01:05:07,730
I saw our entire relationship,
from present to future tense.

1102
01:05:07,803 --> 01:05:12,638
I mean, the incredibly hot start, with Paco
basking in my love and admiration...

1103
01:05:13,175 --> 01:05:15,234
- What are we doing here?
- I just got to pick something up.

1104
01:05:15,311 --> 01:05:16,335
Just take a second.

1105
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:19,279
And then the inevitable moment,
and I don't know why it...

1106
01:05:19,348 --> 01:05:20,645
- Hello.
- Hi.

1107
01:05:20,716 --> 01:05:23,276
I don't know why it happens,
but it always does,

1108
01:05:23,352 --> 01:05:25,616
when all that love and admiration
would start to irritate him

1109
01:05:25,688 --> 01:05:27,849
and he'd find some way to hurt me.

1110
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:30,449
I mean, sure, after, he'd be sorry.

1111
01:05:30,526 --> 01:05:32,187
So...

1112
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:36,129
I decided to unlock his beautiful lips
from mine,

1113
01:05:36,198 --> 01:05:38,359
remove his hand from my ass,

1114
01:05:40,503 --> 01:05:44,234
- and I walked away.
- Good move.

1115
01:05:44,307 --> 01:05:47,037
- I walked away, Will! From Paco!
- Good move.

1116
01:05:47,109 --> 01:05:49,600
- No one walks away from Paco!
- I like the story.

1117
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:51,943
And it felt life-changing.

1118
01:05:52,014 --> 01:05:54,312
And I realized I had to tell someone.

1119
01:05:54,383 --> 01:05:56,408
When I realized who that person was,

1120
01:05:56,485 --> 01:05:58,476
- it was so unexpected.
- Here we are, sir.

1121
01:05:58,554 --> 01:06:00,385
It's like when something is staring you
in the face

1122
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:03,482
and it's like you're too blind to see it.

1123
01:06:03,559 --> 01:06:04,890
What's that?

1124
01:06:06,929 --> 01:06:09,159
I have some news for you, too.

1125
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:16,534
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Why are you so upset?

1126
01:06:16,605 --> 01:06:19,631
Don't you think it's a little weird we've been
writing each other for however long

1127
01:06:19,709 --> 01:06:21,677
and somehow you neglect to tell me that,

1128
01:06:21,744 --> 01:06:26,374
A, you've fallen in love,
and, B, you've fallen in love!

1129
01:06:26,449 --> 01:06:28,041
- I told you I was dating someone.
- Dating someone.

1130
01:06:28,117 --> 01:06:30,813
You just bought
a diamond engagement ring for someone!

1131
01:06:30,886 --> 01:06:32,979
I'm sorry.
I think I was just nervous to tell you.

1132
01:06:33,055 --> 01:06:35,683
Why would you be nervous to tell me?

1133
01:06:37,393 --> 01:06:39,054
I don't know.

1134
01:06:39,595 --> 01:06:41,620
I love this girl so much.

1135
01:06:43,099 --> 01:06:45,659
I'd just really like you to be happy for me.

1136
01:06:46,936 --> 01:06:50,599
I can be happy for you.
Of course I can be happy for you.

1137
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:55,868
<i>Poor April.</i>

1138
01:06:55,978 --> 01:06:59,414
<i>She's like the character in the story
who's always been the friend.</i>

1139
01:06:59,482 --> 01:07:02,542
Then she realized
she doesn't just want to be the friend.

1140
01:07:02,618 --> 01:07:05,587
She wants to be the girlfriend,
except it's too late.

1141
01:07:05,654 --> 01:07:07,087
What do you mean?

1142
01:07:07,156 --> 01:07:10,284
Weren't you listening?
She came home for you.

1143
01:07:15,998 --> 01:07:18,489
There's union seals
on all the menus, my friend.

1144
01:07:18,567 --> 01:07:22,230
The weather cleared in Chicago.
The President will be here by 8:00.

1145
01:07:22,304 --> 01:07:23,464
Where's Russ?

1146
01:07:23,539 --> 01:07:25,268
Gonna meet you and Arthur
in the restaurant.

1147
01:07:25,341 --> 01:07:27,002
<i>I'm funnier over here.</i>

1148
01:07:29,011 --> 01:07:31,206
<i>I can't stop my leg</i>

1149
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:38,884
You're early.

1150
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:46,184
Good to see you.

1151
01:07:46,262 --> 01:07:48,093
- You look great.
- Thank you. You, too.

1152
01:07:48,164 --> 01:07:51,327
- That's a nice tie.
- Well, you'd know.

1153
01:07:52,334 --> 01:07:56,395
So, the magazine asked me
to do a follow-up on Robredo.

1154
01:07:56,472 --> 01:07:59,464
- Great.
- Yeah, it is great. It's also...

1155
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:02,104
It's...

1156
01:08:03,612 --> 01:08:05,773
You just read it.

1157
01:08:05,848 --> 01:08:07,679
- You already wrote it.
- Yeah.

1158
01:08:16,859 --> 01:08:19,089
- He did this?
- Yes.

1159
01:08:19,195 --> 01:08:23,598
They actually got a friend an early parole.

1160
01:08:23,666 --> 01:08:28,365
You know what?
I think it happened such a long time ago,

1161
01:08:28,437 --> 01:08:30,371
and you're way ahead in all the polls.

1162
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:35,103
Yeah, see, I don't think that's gonna matter,
because he's the tough-on-crime Democrat.

1163
01:08:35,177 --> 01:08:36,644
That's...

1164
01:08:37,179 --> 01:08:39,272
When people read this...

1165
01:08:41,617 --> 01:08:43,915
Summer, listen to me.

1166
01:08:43,986 --> 01:08:47,046
If you hand this in, we won't survive it.

1167
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:49,785
I think it'll be a big deal for about a week,
and then the storm will pass...

1168
01:08:49,859 --> 01:08:52,089
I'm talking about you and me.

1169
01:08:53,596 --> 01:08:57,157
<i>"Candidate Brought Down
by Speechwriter's Girlfriend."</i>

1170
01:08:57,233 --> 01:08:59,793
- Come on.
- I'm just doing my job.

1171
01:09:00,903 --> 01:09:03,428
I didn't do it the first time around.

1172
01:09:03,506 --> 01:09:06,964
And if I didn't write this,
somebody else would.

1173
01:09:08,010 --> 01:09:09,170
Let them.

1174
01:09:09,678 --> 01:09:12,078
Hey, don't hand this in, okay?

1175
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:19,685
You already did.

1176
01:09:35,771 --> 01:09:37,068
Mr. Arthur...

1177
01:09:38,407 --> 01:09:39,874
Yeah, sure.

1178
01:09:40,643 --> 01:09:42,133
I really liked Summer.

1179
01:09:42,211 --> 01:09:44,076
I can't believe
she turned out to be such a...

1180
01:09:44,146 --> 01:09:45,340
- Heartbreaker?
- No.

1181
01:09:45,414 --> 01:09:47,712
- Opportunist? Double-crossing...
- Uh-uh.

1182
01:09:47,783 --> 01:09:49,683
- Bitch.
- Maya.

1183
01:09:49,752 --> 01:09:51,617
How could she do that to you?

1184
01:09:51,687 --> 01:09:55,282
It's like she said. If she didn't write it,
someone else would have.

1185
01:09:55,357 --> 01:09:56,881
And it was the truth.

1186
01:09:56,959 --> 01:09:59,291
So did she? Did she break it?

1187
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:00,726
What?

1188
01:10:06,769 --> 01:10:08,600
What happened when the article came out?

1189
01:10:24,787 --> 01:10:28,450
You screwed up, man.
You really screwed up.

1190
01:10:28,524 --> 01:10:30,219
Please save it.
I don't need to hear this right now.

1191
01:10:30,292 --> 01:10:32,556
Whenever I figure out whatever
I'm supposed to learn from all this,

1192
01:10:32,628 --> 01:10:34,960
- I'll write you a letter!
- Yeah, can't wait.

1193
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:40,161
<i>So I lost my girl,

- Are you watching?

1200
01:10:58,354 --> 01:11:00,481
<i>These allegations are false.</i>

April?

1202

Yeah, April. Who'd you think it was?
Are you watching or not?

1203
01:11:05,728 --> 01:11:07,559
Of course I'm watching.

1204
01:11:08,697 --> 01:11:10,164
You think he did it, don't you?

1205
01:11:10,232 --> 01:11:14,862
I don't think, I know.
Look at the picture of her. I love her.

1208
01:11:22,011 --> 01:11:23,706

01:11:36,225 --> 01:11:38,216
<i>And I'm working at a bookstore.</i>

1214
01:11:38,827 --> 01:11:41,125
<i>But I've been thinking about
going back to school.</i>

1215
01:11:41,196 --> 01:11:42,424
<i>Cool.</i>

1216
01:11:42,498 --> 01:11:44,227
<i>Hey, did I tell you that I hate my job?</i>

1217
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:46,962
<i>I used to love what I do,
and now I feel like a complete hack.</i>

1218
01:11:47,703 --> 01:11:52,766
<i>- Are you seeing anyone?
- Me? Am I... No, no. Absolutely not.</i>

1219
01:11:52,841 --> 01:11:55,742
<i>In fact, I haven't had sex
since Clinton was re-elected.</i>

1220
01:11:55,811 --> 01:11:58,871
<i>Why bother? He's having enough sex
for the entire country.</i>

1221
01:11:58,947 --> 01:12:00,938
<i>Easy. Easy now.</i>

1222
01:12:01,016 --> 01:12:04,315
<i>Hey, maybe you should
follow his lead and seduce an intern.</i>

1223
01:12:04,386 --> 01:12:06,684
<i>You know, it's funny
that you should mention that.</i>

1224
01:12:06,755 --> 01:12:10,657
<i>There's a fetching young intern
who just started a week ago.</i>

1225
01:12:10,726 --> 01:12:12,489
<i>Great. Ask her out.</i>

1226
01:12:13,262 --> 01:12:15,093
<i>I should, shouldn't I?</i>

1227
01:12:16,065 --> 01:12:19,933
<i>But I don't think I will.
You see, I don't want a fling.</i>

1228
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:22,061
<i>I want the real deal.</i>

1229
01:12:22,137 --> 01:12:25,402
<i>Forget about the real deal.
You don't find it, it finds you.</i>

1230
01:12:25,474 --> 01:12:28,602
What does that mean?
I don't know what that means.

1231
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:31,908
It means that you get to a certain age
and then you're ready.

1232
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:35,245
You know, you're ready for kids
or a commitment or, you know...

1233
01:12:35,317 --> 01:12:36,716
- Sir.
...a mortgage.

1234
01:12:36,785 --> 01:12:38,810
- Table's ready. Okay.
- Thanks.

1235
01:12:38,887 --> 01:12:39,945
You know what I mean?

1236
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:43,150
And the person that you're with then,
they become the one.

1237
01:12:43,225 --> 01:12:45,989
So you're saying it's not who, but it's when.

1238
01:12:46,061 --> 01:12:47,790
- Exactly.
- Okay. All right.

1239
01:12:47,863 --> 01:12:51,924
So there's never been a guy, ever,
that made you think, "This is it.

1240
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,900
<i>"This is him. This is the one."</i>

1241
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:55,630
No.

1242
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:59,364
Okay, then why aren't you out there,
you know, enjoying yourself?

1243
01:12:59,441 --> 01:13:00,703
I am.

1244
01:13:00,776 --> 01:13:02,641
- You are?
- Yes.

1245
01:13:03,412 --> 01:13:05,642
Right now I'm seeing this guy, Kevin.

1246
01:13:06,315 --> 01:13:07,942
- Kevin.
- Kevin.

1247
01:13:08,016 --> 01:13:09,313
Who the hell's Kevin?

1248
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:12,718
Where did... How come you never,
you know, mentioned anything about him?

1249
01:13:12,788 --> 01:13:14,517
I'm mentioning him now.

1250
01:13:15,591 --> 01:13:18,651
Oh, God! They have fresh mint tea.
I love fresh mint tea.

1251
01:13:18,727 --> 01:13:20,092
I love beer.

1252
01:13:20,662 --> 01:13:24,826
<i>It depends upon
what the meaning of the word "is" is.</i>

1253
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:30,031
<i>If it means "there is none"
that is a completely true statement.</i>

1254
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:38,512
<i>Hey, this is April.</i>

1255
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:41,447
<i>I want to talk to you about your birthday.
Call me.</i>

1256
01:13:43,118 --> 01:13:46,918
<i>Hello. I hope this is the right number.
It sounds like you.</i>

1257
01:13:46,989 --> 01:13:48,650
<i>It's Emily!</i>

1258
01:13:50,058 --> 01:13:52,754
<i>I'm in New York, and I was thinking</i>

1259
01:13:52,828 --> 01:13:56,127
<i>maybe we could get a cup of coffee
and catch up.</i>

1260
01:13:56,665 --> 01:13:57,859
<i>My number...</i>

1261
01:13:59,868 --> 01:14:03,804
<i>Hey, it's April. I still need to talk to you.
Please call me back.</i>

1262
01:14:03,872 --> 01:14:05,669
<i>I mean, don't make me come over there
and hurt you.</i>

1263
01:14:08,577 --> 01:14:11,068
Okay, I'm coming!

1264
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:13,911
God, I'm coming.

1265
01:14:14,983 --> 01:14:16,610
Yeah, I get it.

1266
01:14:20,155 --> 01:14:22,123
What are you doing in there?

1267
01:14:22,891 --> 01:14:25,052
- Is this what you're wearing?
- What?

1268
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:28,494
It's your birthday party.
Everybody is waiting for you.

1269
01:14:28,564 --> 01:14:30,054
Oh, Christ.

1270
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:32,293
Five minutes, okay? Five...

1271
01:14:34,803 --> 01:14:36,737
I'm down.
- Are you okay?

1272
01:14:36,805 --> 01:14:39,467
Yeah. I just need to lie here for a sec.

1273
01:14:41,009 --> 01:14:43,341
I see you've been eating noodles.

1274
01:14:46,882 --> 01:14:48,907
Hey, everybody, he's here!

1275
01:14:54,523 --> 01:14:55,512
Thanks.

1276
01:14:56,892 --> 01:14:57,881
Hi.

1277
01:15:00,929 --> 01:15:03,898
Oh, my God! I didn't think you'd be here!

1278
01:15:03,966 --> 01:15:06,264
I couldn't miss your birthday.
We came all the way up from Washington.

1279
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:08,064
Happy birthday, gorgeous.

1280
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:10,900
That is a beautiful woman right there.

1281
01:15:10,973 --> 01:15:12,600
You had your chance, pal.

1282
01:15:12,674 --> 01:15:14,005
Hayes.

1283
01:15:19,414 --> 01:15:20,745
Come on.

1284
01:15:23,619 --> 01:15:27,055
- It's great to see you.
- Yeah. You look...

1285
01:15:27,122 --> 01:15:28,612
Homeless, I know.

1286
01:15:29,791 --> 01:15:32,123
- Where's Kelly?
- She's right over there.

1287
01:15:32,194 --> 01:15:34,992
It's her first night out
since the baby was born.

1288
01:15:36,231 --> 01:15:37,562
Congratulations.

1289
01:15:39,067 --> 01:15:42,833
Iran-Contra. Arms for oil, no problem.

1290
01:15:42,905 --> 01:15:46,534
But a little "oralness"
and you're headed for impeachment.

1291
01:15:47,509 --> 01:15:50,205
- No politics!
- Maybe he should be impeached.

1292
01:15:50,279 --> 01:15:52,873
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait! Did he say that?

1293
01:15:52,948 --> 01:15:55,940
- Why not? I put my faith in him. We all did.
- You love him.

1294
01:15:56,018 --> 01:15:57,645
I thought he was gonna be different
than the other jokers,

1295
01:15:57,719 --> 01:16:00,483
but this guy,
he can't even define the word "is."

1296
01:16:01,456 --> 01:16:05,119
What happens if they give him
one of the hard words, like "truth"?

1297
01:16:05,861 --> 01:16:08,261
- I'd vote for him again.
- In a heartbeat.

1298
01:16:12,301 --> 01:16:13,461
Will's a lot of fun.

1299
01:16:13,535 --> 01:16:15,469
Yeah, let's fill up the tub
and drop in a toaster.

1300
01:16:15,537 --> 01:16:17,334
That should be a good time.

1301
01:16:20,876 --> 01:16:25,472
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1302
01:16:25,547 --> 01:16:30,575
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1303
01:16:30,652 --> 01:16:34,418
<i>Happy birthday, dear Will</i>

1304
01:16:34,489 --> 01:16:38,755
- Where is he? Where's Will?
- I don't know. I was just talking to him.

1305
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:57,912
You missed your birthday cake.

1306
01:16:58,013 --> 01:16:59,002
Uh-oh.

1307
01:16:59,414 --> 01:17:01,905
- And I baked it.
- You baked it.

1308
01:17:04,653 --> 01:17:06,484
Do you remember that song?

1309
01:17:06,555 --> 01:17:08,250
In your apartment?

1310
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:12,453
<i>Come as you are, as a friend</i>

1311
01:17:12,527 --> 01:17:14,859
<i>As a known enemy</i>

1312
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:18,832
- "Memory," not "enemy."
- I know, I know, I know.

1313
01:17:19,568 --> 01:17:23,163
- Somebody had too much to drink.
- No, I didn't.

1314
01:17:23,238 --> 01:17:24,967
I didn't, I didn't. I didn't.

1315
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:26,564
- Yes, you did.
- I did.

1316
01:17:33,281 --> 01:17:36,148
- God, you're beautiful.
- Thank you.

1317
01:17:40,088 --> 01:17:41,419
What?

1318
01:17:43,291 --> 01:17:44,383
The thing is...

1319
01:17:45,761 --> 01:17:47,592
The thing is...

1320
01:17:48,864 --> 01:17:50,832
Is that I like you.

1321
01:17:53,769 --> 01:17:55,600
I've always liked you.

1322
01:17:58,607 --> 01:17:59,938
<i>"Like."</i>

1323
01:18:00,842 --> 01:18:03,333
That's pathetic. It's so puny.

1324
01:18:05,814 --> 01:18:07,441
<i>"Love" on the other hand...</i>

1325
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:10,178
You'd run away from a word like that.

1326
01:18:13,055 --> 01:18:14,386
I love you.

1327
01:18:18,093 --> 01:18:20,220
I'm in love with you, April.

1328
01:18:28,136 --> 01:18:31,697
- Why didn't you ever tell me?
- Come on.

1329
01:18:31,773 --> 01:18:36,107
You know exactly why I never told you.
You'd never be interested in me.

1330
01:18:36,678 --> 01:18:38,270
You're an idiot.

1331
01:18:47,756 --> 01:18:49,189
- Stop.
- What?

1332
01:18:49,257 --> 01:18:52,055
- Not like this.
- Like what?

1333
01:18:52,127 --> 01:18:54,493
Look at you, Will, you're a mess.

1334
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:57,623
Why couldn't you have told me
when you had your shit together?

1335
01:18:57,699 --> 01:19:00,600
- My shit is together.
- Your shit is a mess.

1336
01:19:01,937 --> 01:19:03,495
You're a mess.

1337
01:19:06,274 --> 01:19:08,105
My shit is a mess?

1338
01:19:09,277 --> 01:19:12,041
That's interesting, coming from you, April.

1339
01:19:14,149 --> 01:19:19,246
You could do anything on earth,
and you work in a bookstore.

1340
01:19:19,321 --> 01:19:21,312
What's that all about?

1341
01:19:22,357 --> 01:19:25,087
At least I tried. I went out there and I tried.

1342
01:19:26,495 --> 01:19:30,556
Look, I'm just saying this as a friend,
and I swear, it's just as a friend,

1343
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:34,535
but maybe you should go out there
and, you know, get some help.

1344
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:36,696
Go to rehab or life rehab
or something like that.

1345
01:19:36,772 --> 01:19:39,434
I don't even know if they have
that sort of thing, but if they did...

1346
01:19:39,508 --> 01:19:40,532
Okay.

1347
01:19:40,609 --> 01:19:42,167
...you know, you could be
a prime candidate for that.

1348
01:19:42,244 --> 01:19:44,576
<i>- I should go to "life rehab"?
- Yeah.</i>

1349
01:19:48,483 --> 01:19:50,348
Get off my front porch!

1350
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:53,080
April?

1351
01:20:17,179 --> 01:20:18,510
You're right.

1352
01:20:21,149 --> 01:20:23,913
It is complicated, isn't it?

1353
01:20:23,985 --> 01:20:28,479
I mean, you're in love with April,
who used to be in love with Lucas,

1354
01:20:28,557 --> 01:20:31,117
and then she fell in love with you,
but you were in love with Summer,

1355
01:20:31,193 --> 01:20:33,889
who was always really in love with Hampton.

1356
01:20:33,962 --> 01:20:37,591
And now that you're in love with April,
she's in love with Kevin.

1357
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,661
And no one's in love with you.

1358
01:20:41,703 --> 01:20:43,568
That's complicated.

1359
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:46,100
Yep.

1360
01:20:47,142 --> 01:20:48,905
Then what happened?

1361
01:21:08,797 --> 01:21:11,823
<i>Jane Eyre, Random House, 1943.</i>

1362
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:16,098
It's a beautiful edition,
known for the cover illustration.

1363
01:21:16,171 --> 01:21:20,335
But there's a really nice dedication inside,
with a quote from the book.

1364
01:21:20,408 --> 01:21:24,401
<i>"To my darling daughter, April.
'The human heart has hidden treasures</i>

1365
01:21:24,479 --> 01:21:27,107
- "'In secret kept, in silence sealed..."'
- "'In silence sealed

1366
01:21:27,182 --> 01:21:29,616
<i>"'The thoughts, the hopes
the dreams, the pleasures</i>

1367
01:21:29,684 --> 01:21:32,414
"'Whose charms were broken if revealed'

1368
01:21:33,154 --> 01:21:35,145
<i>"From your loving father."</i>

1369
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:47,491
- Hi, Olivia.
- Hi, Will.

1370
01:21:48,270 --> 01:21:49,532
- How you been?
- Good.

1371
01:21:49,604 --> 01:21:52,095
I haven't heard any of your long
sorry messages in a while.

1372
01:21:52,173 --> 01:21:55,074
Those were delightful, weren't they?
Sorry about that.

1373
01:21:55,143 --> 01:21:57,043
- April here?
- No, she's at school.

1374
01:21:57,112 --> 01:21:59,080
- School?
- Yeah.

1375
01:21:59,147 --> 01:22:03,140
- She started grad school at NYU.
- Great. Wow.

1376
01:22:03,218 --> 01:22:06,312
- If you want to wait, she'll be home soon.
- I'd love to.

1377
01:22:06,388 --> 01:22:10,222
Make yourself comfortable.
I have to finish this application I'm writing.

1378
01:22:10,292 --> 01:22:12,089
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

1379
01:22:36,084 --> 01:22:37,142
Hey.

1380
01:22:37,752 --> 01:22:39,083
How you doing?

1381
01:22:40,789 --> 01:22:41,949
Kevin.

1382
01:22:43,992 --> 01:22:45,323
Will Hayes.

1383
01:22:46,394 --> 01:22:49,158
I'm just waiting for April.

1384
01:22:51,166 --> 01:22:53,657
Are you the same Kevin
that she mentioned a while back?

1385
01:22:54,836 --> 01:22:57,634
I hope so. Unless she's collecting Kevins.

1386
01:22:57,706 --> 01:22:59,833
Kevin, phone!

1387
01:22:59,908 --> 01:23:03,901
Anyway, I'm pretty sure I am the only Kevin
who's actually living with her.

1388
01:23:43,084 --> 01:23:45,075
Do you know what you want yet?

1389
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:47,785
- No.
- No?

1390
01:23:53,495 --> 01:23:55,122
Will?

1391
01:23:55,597 --> 01:23:57,360
William Hayes?

1392
01:23:57,432 --> 01:23:59,332
God.

1393
01:23:59,401 --> 01:24:01,198
- It is!
- Summer.

1394
01:24:01,970 --> 01:24:03,733
You look beautiful.

1395
01:24:04,539 --> 01:24:07,736
Believe it or not,
I've been meaning to call you.

1396
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:11,938
- I'm pregnant.
- You're what?

1397
01:24:12,013 --> 01:24:13,571
- Really?
- Can you believe it?

1398
01:24:13,648 --> 01:24:16,014
- Please, sit. Congratulations.
- Thanks. Thanks.

1399
01:24:16,084 --> 01:24:17,244
Who's the lucky guy?

1400
01:24:17,318 --> 01:24:19,047
- Sam Knowles.
- Okay.

1401
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:21,179
But he's basically out of the picture.

1402
01:24:21,256 --> 01:24:23,281
- He didn't make the cut, huh?
- Yeah.

1403
01:24:23,358 --> 01:24:28,591
Well, I don't need a guy. I never really did.

1404
01:24:28,663 --> 01:24:30,961
You were about the closest I ever got.

1405
01:24:31,032 --> 01:24:35,128
No, really, when I was with you,
I thought, "This is it."

1406
01:24:35,203 --> 01:24:36,500
But I screwed it up.

1407
01:24:36,571 --> 01:24:39,404
- No, you didn't.
- I did. I so did.

1408
01:24:40,008 --> 01:24:41,498
Listen,

1409
01:24:41,576 --> 01:24:45,512
I'm having a little party Sunday.

1410
01:24:46,314 --> 01:24:48,441
- I want you to come.
- Oh, boy.

1411
01:24:49,084 --> 01:24:50,813
4:00. No excuses.

1412
01:24:52,887 --> 01:24:55,754
Will you come? Please?

1413
01:24:55,824 --> 01:24:57,815
You know, I'll see if I can make it.

1414
01:24:57,892 --> 01:25:00,622
- I really want you to.
- I'll make it.

1415
01:25:00,695 --> 01:25:03,129
I want to make amends
with anyone I ever hurt.

1416
01:25:03,198 --> 01:25:06,690
And I figure it'll take about nine months,

1417
01:25:06,768 --> 01:25:08,599
which is perfect timing.

1418
01:25:10,305 --> 01:25:12,296
- And she's off. Bye.
- Bye-bye.

1419
01:25:14,742 --> 01:25:16,039
William Hayes.

1420
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:19,171
- Dad, maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
- What?

1421
01:25:19,247 --> 01:25:23,013
Telling me this story,
this mystery love story.

1422
01:25:24,285 --> 01:25:27,686
- What if I don't like who my mom is?
- Of course you'll like who your mom is.

1423
01:25:27,755 --> 01:25:30,383
And you don't have to wait long to find out,
because that very night...

1424
01:25:30,458 --> 01:25:33,359
It's Summer, isn't it?
And you're not my father.

1425
01:25:33,428 --> 01:25:35,191
No wonder you didn't want to be with her.

1426
01:25:35,263 --> 01:25:38,596
Take it easy, Maya. It's just a story.

1427
01:25:40,034 --> 01:25:42,764
And this one has a happy ending.

1428
01:25:42,837 --> 01:25:45,203
How does it have a happy ending?

1429
01:25:45,273 --> 01:25:49,676
You and my mom, whoever she is,
you're getting divorced.

1430
01:25:50,645 --> 01:25:52,977
What's the happy in that?

1431
01:25:57,418 --> 01:25:59,386
Okay, you know what?
I think we should stop now.

1432
01:25:59,454 --> 01:26:00,785
No!

1433
01:26:03,691 --> 01:26:05,784
Then how about a nice cup of tea?

1434
01:26:06,361 --> 01:26:09,694
If you want, I'll still continue with the story.
Does that sound good?

1435
01:26:09,764 --> 01:26:11,732
- Maya?
- Okay.

1436
01:26:18,139 --> 01:26:19,629
Dad?

1437
01:26:21,442 --> 01:26:26,573
I can't believe you smoked
and drank and were such a slut.

1438
01:26:29,584 --> 01:26:31,415
But I still love you.

1439
01:27:34,649 --> 01:27:35,980
Thanks.

1440
01:27:36,050 --> 01:27:38,280
All right. All right.

1441
01:27:38,353 --> 01:27:41,413
No, no. Don't eat it yet!
Not till we get to our bench.

1442
01:27:42,290 --> 01:27:43,780
You're in a good mood.

1443
01:27:43,858 --> 01:27:47,851
Well, I think I discovered
who my mom is in the story.

1444
01:27:47,929 --> 01:27:49,954
- Really?
- Really.

1445
01:27:50,898 --> 01:27:53,162
- Well, who is it?
- Not telling.

1446
01:27:54,936 --> 01:27:57,234
So the last time we saw William Hayes,

1447
01:27:57,305 --> 01:28:00,866
he had just discovered that
the woman he truly loved, April Hoffman,

1448
01:28:00,975 --> 01:28:02,067
was in love with another man.

1449
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:05,371
I know. Shocking.

1450
01:28:06,347 --> 01:28:08,372
<i>Meanwhile, he accepted an invitation</i>

1451
01:28:08,449 --> 01:28:11,441
<i>to the home of his ex-girlfriend,
Summer Hartley,</i>

1452
01:28:11,519 --> 01:28:15,478
<i>who, if she does turn out to be my mother,
I'm running away to Canada.</i>

1453
01:28:15,556 --> 01:28:17,217
<i>I'm not kidding.</i>

1454
01:28:24,932 --> 01:28:27,366
- He died last year.
- Yeah.

1455
01:28:27,435 --> 01:28:30,063
<i>- You heard?
- I read about it in The Times.</i>

1456
01:28:30,138 --> 01:28:31,662
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1457
01:28:31,906 --> 01:28:34,340
- God. Died in his office. Heart attack?
- Yeah.

1458
01:28:34,409 --> 01:28:38,470
I always imagined
that he'd make a more theatrical exit.

1459
01:28:38,546 --> 01:28:42,038
What they didn't say was he was
on the couch with the dean's daughter.

1460
01:28:42,116 --> 01:28:43,947
- Jesus.
- I'm kidding.

1461
01:28:44,886 --> 01:28:50,324
Actually, he was completely alone and
it was hours before the janitor found him.

1462
01:28:51,292 --> 01:28:53,886
- You want a drink?
- I'm sorry.

1463
01:28:53,961 --> 01:28:56,691
- You must miss him.
- I do, yeah.

1464
01:28:57,598 --> 01:28:58,724
These are for you.

1465
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:01,234
- Oh, Will.
- Yeah.

1466
01:29:03,371 --> 01:29:05,202
They're beautiful.

1467
01:29:07,308 --> 01:29:08,707
So are you.

1468
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:12,880
- Summer.
- Will.

1469
01:29:12,947 --> 01:29:14,710
Don't mess with me.

1470
01:29:14,782 --> 01:29:16,113
I can see where you're going with this.

1471
01:29:16,184 --> 01:29:19,176
In a second, you're gonna
say something impossibly charming.

1472
01:29:19,253 --> 01:29:21,187
- Really?
- Yeah. It's gonna be great.

1473
01:29:21,255 --> 01:29:24,418
And then you're gonna sweep me off my feet
and we all know where that's going.

1474
01:29:24,492 --> 01:29:26,756
- Can't a girl miss a guy?
- And you know that's gonna end badly.

1475
01:29:26,828 --> 01:29:28,090
Yeah, she can,

1476
01:29:28,796 --> 01:29:31,390
but I just don't really have time for the pain.

1477
01:29:31,466 --> 01:29:35,425
- So let's just skip all that, why don't we?
- Okay.

1478
01:29:36,337 --> 01:29:37,668
Fair enough.

1479
01:29:38,539 --> 01:29:39,904
Can we be friends?

1480
01:29:39,974 --> 01:29:41,965
- Yeah! Yeah.
- Yeah.

1481
01:29:42,043 --> 01:29:44,671
- Shake on it? Okay.
- Let's do that. All right.

1482
01:29:47,648 --> 01:29:49,377
You know what?

1483
01:29:51,686 --> 01:29:54,086
There's someone here I want you to meet.

1484
01:29:55,189 --> 01:29:57,680
Yeah. Come with me.

1485
01:29:57,759 --> 01:29:59,056
They're an old flame of mine,

1486
01:29:59,127 --> 01:30:03,359
and I think you guys are really gonna,
you know, hit it off.

1487
01:30:07,201 --> 01:30:08,361
Emily.

1488
01:30:11,038 --> 01:30:13,165
I'm gonna put these in some water.

1489
01:30:16,511 --> 01:30:17,842
- You look...
- You look...

1490
01:30:19,847 --> 01:30:21,144
You look great.

1491
01:30:22,517 --> 01:30:25,680
- Why are you in New York?
- I live here.

1492
01:30:25,753 --> 01:30:29,211
I took a job
with the city education department.

1493
01:30:29,290 --> 01:30:31,758
- I called you.
- I know.

1494
01:30:31,826 --> 01:30:34,351
- I've been meaning to call you back.
- Liar.

1495
01:30:35,196 --> 01:30:36,857
- I had lost your number.
- Of course.

1496
01:30:36,931 --> 01:30:39,365
- No, it's true. You know what?
- Will...

1497
01:30:39,434 --> 01:30:41,299
Okay, give me your number, right now.

1498
01:30:41,369 --> 01:30:45,328
I'm gonna put it in my cell phone,
and that way I'm never gonna lose it, okay?

1499
01:30:46,908 --> 01:30:52,210
My number is 212-664-7665.

1500
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:55,306
Six, six, five. See? Now I got it.
And I'm never gonna lose it again.

1501
01:30:58,319 --> 01:31:00,480
- Oh, no, go ahead, go ahead.
- Sorry.

1502
01:31:00,555 --> 01:31:02,216
- Hello.
- Hey, it's Will.

1503
01:31:03,357 --> 01:31:06,121
I'm really sorry I lost your number.

1504
01:31:07,361 --> 01:31:11,058
I just had the weirdest flash
of a whole life,

1505
01:31:11,132 --> 01:31:13,464
one that never, ever happened.

1506
01:31:16,437 --> 01:31:18,462
What did happen to us?

1507
01:31:18,539 --> 01:31:20,530
- You slept with my roommate.
- Oh!

1508
01:31:21,742 --> 01:31:23,073
I'm sorry.

1509
01:31:23,144 --> 01:31:25,908
If I remember correctly,
I believe it was my "plan," wasn't it?

1510
01:31:25,980 --> 01:31:27,743
- The plan. Remember that?
- Yes, the plan.

1511
01:31:27,815 --> 01:31:28,907
Who talks like that?

1512
01:31:28,983 --> 01:31:34,285
No, it wasn't the plan.
I was scared of you and your dreams,

1513
01:31:35,790 --> 01:31:38,782
and then after we broke up, I just felt lost.

1514
01:31:39,961 --> 01:31:44,864
I still feel pretty lost,
especially when it comes to relationships.

1515
01:31:46,033 --> 01:31:47,193
Yeah.

1516
01:31:48,202 --> 01:31:50,693
Yeah, I've been... Me, too.

1517
01:31:57,111 --> 01:31:59,841
Did you ever think

1518
01:32:00,481 --> 01:32:03,917
that maybe we just needed a different plan?

1519
01:32:04,886 --> 01:32:07,821
<i>Wait! Stop! Stop right there.
Now, go back.</i>

1520
01:32:09,023 --> 01:32:11,753
<i>Okay, stop. Now go forward, slowly.</i>

1521
01:32:12,593 --> 01:32:14,117
<i>Now here it comes.</i>

1522
01:32:14,195 --> 01:32:15,822
<i>There! Right there!</i>

1523
01:32:16,330 --> 01:32:18,560
That's it! That's how I figured it out!

1524
01:32:18,633 --> 01:32:20,396
That's what Mom does when I'm upset.

1525
01:32:20,468 --> 01:32:23,062
<i>She fluffs up my hair
and tells me to be brilliant</i>

1526
01:32:23,137 --> 01:32:26,072
or shine like the sun,
and it always makes me feel better.

1527
01:32:26,140 --> 01:32:28,404
- Sounds like a great mom.
- She is a great mom.

1528
01:32:28,476 --> 01:32:34,972
So you're absolutely positive,
100%, that Emily is the very same woman

1529
01:32:35,349 --> 01:32:37,544
walking toward us right now?

1530
01:32:38,953 --> 01:32:40,386
Absolutely.

1531
01:32:40,788 --> 01:32:42,016
Is it?

1532
01:32:44,058 --> 01:32:46,322
- Mom! Mom!
- Hey!

1533
01:32:49,997 --> 01:32:51,487
I'm so glad it's you.

1534
01:32:51,566 --> 01:32:54,126
- Well, who else would it be?
- Nobody.

1535
01:32:55,069 --> 01:32:57,401
- Good morning, Will.
- Hey, Sarah.

1536
01:32:58,406 --> 01:33:00,874
Mom, can Dad come with us to the zoo?

1537
01:33:00,942 --> 01:33:03,103
Yeah, if Dad wants to come, sure.

1538
01:33:04,745 --> 01:33:07,578
You know, I love the zoo.
Let's go to the zoo.

1539
01:33:09,317 --> 01:33:10,682
- Guess what, Mom?
- What?

1540
01:33:10,751 --> 01:33:13,447
We learned all about sexual intercourse
at school yesterday.

1541
01:33:13,521 --> 01:33:15,352
- Really?
- Really.

1542
01:33:15,523 --> 01:33:16,581
Really.

1543
01:33:28,736 --> 01:33:30,226
I love penguins.

1544
01:33:31,205 --> 01:33:32,467
Me, too.

1545
01:33:32,540 --> 01:33:33,700
Me, three.

1546
01:33:44,085 --> 01:33:46,849
Did you know that penguins mate for life?

1547
01:33:46,921 --> 01:33:49,014
Although, Mr. Monell told us

1548
01:33:49,090 --> 01:33:51,490
that sometimes the husband
and wife penguins get separated

1549
01:33:51,559 --> 01:33:53,220
'cause of their migraine patterns.

1550
01:33:53,294 --> 01:33:54,625
- Migratory.
- Migratory.

1551
01:33:55,363 --> 01:33:59,925
Well, sometimes they're apart for years,
but they almost always find each other.

1552
01:34:04,372 --> 01:34:05,999
Do you know
what the husband and wife penguins do

1553
01:34:06,073 --> 01:34:08,803
after they find each other after all that time?

1554
01:34:10,011 --> 01:34:11,740
Throw back their heads,

1555
01:34:11,812 --> 01:34:15,043
flap their flippers
and sing as loud as they can!

1556
01:35:00,661 --> 01:35:03,494
Okay. All right, munchkin. Let's go!

1557
01:35:07,568 --> 01:35:11,163
Hey, monster, that was fun today.
I'll see you on Wednesday, okay?

1558
01:35:15,176 --> 01:35:16,734
See you later.

1559
01:35:19,747 --> 01:35:21,078
Dad!

1560
01:35:27,988 --> 01:35:31,116
- Thanks for telling me the story.
- You're welcome.

1561
01:35:32,693 --> 01:35:36,686
- I forgot to tell you the happy ending.
- What is it?

1562
01:35:37,898 --> 01:35:39,229
You.

1563
01:35:49,610 --> 01:35:52,170
- Hey, I love you.
- I love you, too.

1564
01:35:52,246 --> 01:35:55,272
Go catch up to your mom, okay?
All right, bye.

1565
01:35:57,518 --> 01:35:58,746
Are you all right?

1566
01:35:58,819 --> 01:35:59,979
Yeah?

1567
01:36:18,472 --> 01:36:20,940
Mr. President! Hey, Mr. President!

1568
01:36:21,008 --> 01:36:24,000
Will Hayes, I worked on the '92 campaign.

1569
01:37:52,333 --> 01:37:54,665
Hi. I'm looking for April.

1570
01:38:04,745 --> 01:38:07,179
Check that they have
legal representation, okay?

1571
01:38:07,248 --> 01:38:08,806
- Right.
- Thanks, John.

1572
01:38:17,358 --> 01:38:18,416
I can't believe you're doing this.

1573
01:38:18,492 --> 01:38:19,618
- This is great.
- Thanks.

1574
01:38:19,693 --> 01:38:21,058
- Still smoking?
- I quit.

1575
01:38:21,128 --> 01:38:24,723
- Me, too. Still live in the same loft?
- Living in Brooklyn.

1576
01:38:24,798 --> 01:38:26,698
Always on the cutting edge.

1577
01:38:26,767 --> 01:38:29,668
- Dating?
- Not at present. You?

1578
01:38:30,504 --> 01:38:32,665
- I got divorced.
- I know.

1579
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:34,605
I heard. I'm so sorry.

1580
01:38:34,675 --> 01:38:36,302
Why?

1581
01:38:36,377 --> 01:38:38,072
You always said marriage was overrated.

1582
01:38:38,145 --> 01:38:41,410
Yeah, and you never listened to me.
You were always with the rings.

1583
01:38:41,482 --> 01:38:44,781
- Is that why you and Kevin never...
- Oh, God, Kevin. No. Kevin...

1584
01:38:45,819 --> 01:38:47,684
Something always seemed
to be missing with Kevin.

1585
01:38:47,755 --> 01:38:49,746
I don't know.

1586
01:38:49,823 --> 01:38:54,260
It's weird. It was never quite right.
You know?

1587
01:38:54,328 --> 01:38:55,488
Yeah.

1588
01:38:56,730 --> 01:38:59,460
- It's good to see you.
- You, too.

1589
01:39:02,636 --> 01:39:04,695
I have something for you.

1590
01:39:46,814 --> 01:39:48,645
Thank you so much.

1591
01:39:49,984 --> 01:39:52,851
How did you find it?
I mean, where did you find it?

1592
01:39:54,555 --> 01:39:57,183
That's the difficult part to explain.

1593
01:39:59,526 --> 01:40:01,221
This is gonna sound bad.

1594
01:40:02,396 --> 01:40:04,421
I've had it for a while.

1595
01:40:05,399 --> 01:40:06,730
How long?

1596
01:40:07,668 --> 01:40:08,999
Years.

1597
01:40:10,004 --> 01:40:11,494
Many years.

1598
01:40:12,373 --> 01:40:14,307
I meant to...

1599
01:40:14,375 --> 01:40:16,434
I meant to give it to you.
I wanted to give it to you.

1600
01:40:16,510 --> 01:40:18,068
I just...

1601
01:40:18,512 --> 01:40:21,481
I couldn't. And I don't know why.

1602
01:40:22,816 --> 01:40:26,843
I dropped it off once. I mean, I tried.
Kevin was there and...

1603
01:40:26,920 --> 01:40:30,549
Hey, there is no excuse, and I'm sorry.

1604
01:40:31,892 --> 01:40:33,587
It's inexcusable.

1605
01:40:37,898 --> 01:40:40,594
- I think you should go, Will.
- April?

1606
01:40:41,769 --> 01:40:43,669
I think you should go.

1607
01:40:57,985 --> 01:41:01,284
You never gave it to her? After all that time?

1608
01:41:01,355 --> 01:41:03,289
I know. I know.
- But it was from her dad.

1609
01:41:03,357 --> 01:41:05,587
I know. I know.

1610
01:41:05,659 --> 01:41:07,593
And then you just left?

1611
01:41:08,695 --> 01:41:10,026
Yep.

1612
01:41:11,532 --> 01:41:14,729
How come you changed all the names
except hers?

1613
01:41:14,802 --> 01:41:15,928
What do you mean?

1614
01:41:16,003 --> 01:41:18,870
In the story, you know,
like Mom became Emily,

1615
01:41:18,939 --> 01:41:22,670
and Summer's that Natasha lady
who writes for that magazine.

1616
01:41:22,743 --> 01:41:25,507
But you didn't change April's name. Why?

1617
01:41:28,449 --> 01:41:32,545
Why are you so concerned
with all of this anyway?

1618
01:41:32,753 --> 01:41:35,085
Because I want you to be happy.

1619
01:41:35,389 --> 01:41:36,720
You know,

1620
01:41:37,791 --> 01:41:39,452
I'm happy.

1621
01:41:40,427 --> 01:41:42,952
Trust me, Dad. You're not happy.

1622
01:41:56,777 --> 01:41:58,438
Put your coat on.

1623
01:42:03,784 --> 01:42:05,274
- Taxi!
- Taxi!

1624
01:42:12,092 --> 01:42:13,889
She said something was missing
with Kevin,

1625
01:42:13,961 --> 01:42:16,589
which means
it might not be missing with you,

1626
01:42:16,663 --> 01:42:19,427
- which is good news, right?
- Could be.

1627
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:21,697
Could be.

1628
01:42:23,203 --> 01:42:27,037
Did you know that 35 people try
to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge each year?

1629
01:42:27,107 --> 01:42:29,337
Most because of broken hearts.

1630
01:42:30,244 --> 01:42:31,871
I'll keep that in mind.

1631
01:42:49,863 --> 01:42:52,889
<i>Hello.
- Hey. Hi.</i>

1632
01:42:53,066 --> 01:42:54,055
<i>It's me, Will.</i>

1633
01:42:56,503 --> 01:42:57,697
April?

1634
01:43:03,977 --> 01:43:05,808
What are you doing here?

1635
01:43:07,181 --> 01:43:08,205
<i>Uh...</i>

1636
01:43:08,282 --> 01:43:10,045
<i>Go on, tell her.</i>

1637
01:43:11,051 --> 01:43:12,575
Who's that?

1638
01:43:12,653 --> 01:43:15,747
That would be my daughter, Maya.

1639
01:43:15,822 --> 01:43:18,120
That's kind of cheating, isn't it?
Bringing your daughter?

1640
01:43:18,192 --> 01:43:20,092
What am I supposed to do now?

1641
01:43:21,461 --> 01:43:23,452
Well, you could let us in.

1642
01:43:26,366 --> 01:43:29,028
I don't think she's gonna let us in.

1643
01:43:30,971 --> 01:43:32,495
I think you're wrong.

1644
01:43:33,774 --> 01:43:35,241
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

1645
01:43:35,309 --> 01:43:38,676
A little while longer.
She's going to let us in.

1646
01:43:38,745 --> 01:43:40,975
Okay, kiddo, here's the deal.

1647
01:43:41,048 --> 01:43:43,141
I'm gonna count to 30, okay?

1648
01:43:43,217 --> 01:43:45,208
And if she doesn't let us in,
we're gonna go home,

1649
01:43:45,285 --> 01:43:47,219
and we're never gonna talk about this again.

1650
01:43:47,287 --> 01:43:49,448
- Deal?
- Yeah.

1651
01:43:50,057 --> 01:43:51,183
Ready?

1652
01:43:51,825 --> 01:43:56,285
- One, two, three...
- One, two, three...

1653
01:43:56,363 --> 01:44:00,493
<i>...four, five, six...
...four, five, six...</i>

1654
01:44:01,468 --> 01:44:06,565
...14, 15, 16, 17...
...14, 15, 16, 17...

1655
01:44:06,640 --> 01:44:09,632
If she lets us in,
tell her the story like you told me.

1656
01:44:09,710 --> 01:44:11,974
<i>- And then she'll know.
- Know what?</i>

1657
01:44:12,079 --> 01:44:14,070
<i>I can't explain. She'll just know.</i>

1658
01:44:14,948 --> 01:44:19,976
...25, 26, 27...
...25, 26, 27...

1659
01:44:22,322 --> 01:44:24,051
- Twenty-nine.
- Twenty-nine.

1660
01:44:26,126 --> 01:44:28,822
Twenty-nine and a quarter.

1661
01:44:28,895 --> 01:44:31,363
Twenty-nine and a half.

1662
01:44:33,133 --> 01:44:35,465
Twenty-nine and three-quarters.

1663
01:44:36,903 --> 01:44:38,768
What comes after that?

1664
01:44:41,141 --> 01:44:42,540
Time to go.

1665
01:44:45,412 --> 01:44:47,812
But this wasn't
what was supposed to have happened.

1666
01:44:47,881 --> 01:44:49,178
- I know.
- I really thought

1667
01:44:49,249 --> 01:44:53,208
she would have heard through the intercom
and let us in,

1668
01:44:53,287 --> 01:44:54,845
or run down the stairs and say...

1669
01:44:54,921 --> 01:44:56,320
What story?

1670
01:45:00,127 --> 01:45:01,526
What story?

01:45:17,277 --> 01:45:20,838
...because it was the only thing
that I had left of you.
