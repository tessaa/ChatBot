1
00:01:00,741 --> 00:01:02,162
I think its our tradition...

2
00:01:02,543 --> 00:01:03,989
It comes out of a...

3
00:01:04,025 --> 00:01:06,330
...particularly painful
part of our history.

4
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:07,493
Yes. Yes.

5
00:01:07,494 --> 00:01:09,552
But it's been a way
we've been able to heal.

6
00:01:10,345 --> 00:01:12,832
At first it was a
reminder of the rebellion

7
00:01:12,867 --> 00:01:15,316
It was the price the
Districts had to pay.

8
00:01:15,584 --> 00:01:17,375
But I think it has grown from that.

9
00:01:17,412 --> 00:01:19,434
I think its a...

10
00:01:19,743 --> 00:01:21,493
Its something that
nets us all together.

11
00:01:23,315 --> 00:01:25,641
This is your third year's game?

12
00:01:27,247 --> 00:01:29,943
What defines your personal signature?

13
00:01:36,417 --> 00:01:37,609
Shhhh. It's okay.

14
00:01:37,953 --> 00:01:40,357
It's okay.
You're just dreaming.

15
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:41,641
You're dreaming.

16
00:01:45,225 --> 00:01:46,640
I know.

17
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,908
I know what its like.

18
00:01:49,761 --> 00:01:51,493
It's your first...
Prim, your name's gonna

19
00:01:51,493 --> 00:01:53,225
be there once, they're
not gonna pick you!

20
00:01:54,171 --> 00:01:56,283
Try to go to sleep.

21
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:57,854
I can't.

22
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,768
Just try.

23
00:02:00,174 --> 00:02:01,423
Just try.

24
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:16,704
Deep in the meadow.

25
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,261
Under the willow.

26
00:02:21,771 --> 00:02:25,121
Hop in the grass.

27
00:02:25,537 --> 00:02:29,354
A soft green and pillow.

28
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,694
You remember that song?

29
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:34,275
Ok.

30
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:35,377
You finish it.

31
00:02:35,378 --> 00:02:36,298
I gotta go.

32
00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:37,548
Where?

33
00:02:38,082 --> 00:02:39,595
I just gotta go.

34
00:02:39,633 --> 00:02:41,110
But I'll be back.

35
00:02:41,146 --> 00:02:42,421
I love you.

36
00:02:50,993 --> 00:02:52,262
I'll still cook you.

37
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:04,910
What're you gonna do with
that when you kill it?

38
00:05:07,727 --> 00:05:09,047
Damn you, Gale!

39
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:10,725
It's not funny.

40
00:05:10,761 --> 00:05:13,392
What're you gonna do with
a 100 pound deer, Katnip?

41
00:05:13,836 --> 00:05:16,137
It's Reaping Day, the place is
crawling with Peacekeepers.

42
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,489
I was gonna sell it.

43
00:05:17,964 --> 00:05:19,327
From kisskeepers..

44
00:05:19,502 --> 00:05:20,533
Of course you were.

45
00:05:20,534 --> 00:05:22,050
Like you don't sell the Peacekeepers.

46
00:05:22,086 --> 00:05:23,491
No! Not today.

47
00:05:23,526 --> 00:05:25,591
It's the first deer
I've seen in a year.

48
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:26,482
Now, I have nothing.

49
00:05:26,483 --> 00:05:27,722
Okay.

50
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:21,533
What if they did? Just one you.
Why if everyone just stop watching?

51
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:22,364
They won't, Gale.

52
00:06:22,365 --> 00:06:23,632
What if they did? What if we did?

53
00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:24,918
Won't happen.

54
00:06:25,006 --> 00:06:27,906
You root for your favorite, you cry
when they get killed. It's sick.

55
00:06:27,943 --> 00:06:28,736
Gale.

56
00:06:28,737 --> 00:06:29,883
If no one watches...

57
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:32,315
Then they don't have a game.
It's as simple as that.

58
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,260
What?

59
00:06:33,262 --> 00:06:34,509
Nothing.

60
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:36,317
Fine, laught at...

61
00:06:36,318 --> 00:06:37,565
I'm not laughing at you.

62
00:06:44,093 --> 00:06:45,509
We could do it, you know?

63
00:06:48,212 --> 00:06:50,717
Take off. Live in the woods.
What we do anyway?

64
00:06:50,753 --> 00:06:51,600
They'd catch us.

65
00:06:51,601 --> 00:06:52,849
Maybe not.

66
00:06:53,815 --> 00:06:55,563
Cut out our tongues or worse.

67
00:06:56,176 --> 00:06:57,423
We wouldn't make it five miles.

68
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:58,687
No, I get five miles.

69
00:06:59,597 --> 00:07:00,844
We'll go that way.

70
00:07:01,052 --> 00:07:03,017
I have Prim. You have your brothers.

71
00:07:03,054 --> 00:07:04,125
They can come too.

72
00:07:04,127 --> 00:07:05,373
Prim in the woods?

73
00:07:07,187 --> 00:07:08,464
Maybe not.

74
00:07:10,378 --> 00:07:11,772
I'm never having kids.

75
00:07:13,623 --> 00:07:14,620
Not might.

76
00:07:14,621 --> 00:07:15,674
If I don't live here.

77
00:07:15,675 --> 00:07:16,711
But you do live here.

78
00:07:16,713 --> 00:07:17,959
I know, but if I didn't.

79
00:07:21,285 --> 00:07:22,533
Oh, I forgot.

80
00:07:23,407 --> 00:07:24,361
Here.

81
00:07:24,362 --> 00:07:25,609
Oh my God!

82
00:07:26,068 --> 00:07:27,189
Is this real?

83
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,354
Yeah. Better be.

84
00:07:28,355 --> 00:07:29,706
Cost me a squirrel.

85
00:07:31,162 --> 00:07:32,539
Happy Hunger Games.

86
00:07:32,575 --> 00:07:34,655
And be the odds be
ever in your favor.

87
00:07:39,978 --> 00:07:41,632
How many times did
your name in today?

88
00:07:42,828 --> 00:07:44,076
Forty-two?

89
00:07:45,021 --> 00:07:47,059
I guess the odds aren't
exactly in my favor.

90
00:08:15,157 --> 00:08:16,419
Thank you girl.

91
00:08:25,044 --> 00:08:26,308
What's this?

92
00:08:26,857 --> 00:08:28,657
That's a... Mocking Jay.

93
00:08:31,142 --> 00:08:32,406
How much?

94
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:35,459
You keep it.

95
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,723
It's yours.

96
00:08:36,745 --> 00:08:38,009
Thank you.

97
00:08:49,851 --> 00:08:51,102
Mom?

98
00:08:52,856 --> 00:08:54,848
Aww. Look at you.

99
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:57,144
You look beautiful.

100
00:08:57,363 --> 00:08:59,627
Let's better tuck in
that tail by the back.

101
00:08:59,648 --> 00:09:01,360
Made something out for you two.

102
00:09:04,165 --> 00:09:05,418
Okay.

103
00:09:30,155 --> 00:09:31,799
How you look beautiful too.

104
00:09:31,835 --> 00:09:33,442
We should oughta pick you.

105
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,664
Oh no.

106
00:09:35,914 --> 00:09:37,928
Here's how it will
pick you in the back.

107
00:09:43,845 --> 00:09:44,949
Breathe.

108
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,505
Wanna see what I got you today?

109
00:09:49,395 --> 00:09:50,793
It's a Mocking Jay pin.

110
00:09:51,439 --> 00:09:52,693
To protect you.

111
00:09:54,038 --> 00:09:55,311
And as long as you have it.

112
00:09:55,811 --> 00:09:57,524
Nothing bad will happen to you.

113
00:09:57,993 --> 00:09:59,244
Okay?

114
00:09:59,255 --> 00:10:00,507
I promise.

115
00:10:56,366 --> 00:10:57,311
Shh.

116
00:10:57,312 --> 00:11:00,010
Shh. Prim, it's okay. It's okay. Shh.

117
00:11:00,046 --> 00:11:01,699
Okay, it's time to send her now.

118
00:11:01,735 --> 00:11:04,235
Okay, they will prick your finger
to take just a little bit of blood.

119
00:11:04,272 --> 00:11:05,076
I'm scared.

120
00:11:05,077 --> 00:11:06,946
Prim, it doesn't hurt
much. Just a little.

121
00:11:07,382 --> 00:11:08,230
Okay?

122
00:11:08,231 --> 00:11:09,536
Go sit down there
with the little kids.

123
00:11:09,537 --> 00:11:10,837
I'll find you after okay?

124
00:11:11,192 --> 00:11:12,437
Next.

125
00:11:13,184 --> 00:11:14,431
Next.

126
00:11:25,912 --> 00:11:27,001
Go ahead.

127
00:11:27,002 --> 00:11:28,249
Next.

128
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,085
Next.

129
00:11:40,883 --> 00:11:42,128
Next.

130
00:11:44,599 --> 00:11:45,845
Next.

131
00:12:22,001 --> 00:12:23,232
Welcome.

132
00:12:23,233 --> 00:12:25,120
Welcome. Welcome.

133
00:12:25,952 --> 00:12:27,643
Happy Hunger Games.

134
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,070
And...

135
00:12:29,071 --> 00:12:32,512
May the odds be ever in your favor.

136
00:12:33,971 --> 00:12:35,780
Now, before we begin.

137
00:12:35,817 --> 00:12:37,979
We have a very special film.

138
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:41,771
Brought to you all the
way from the Capitol.

139
00:12:48,892 --> 00:12:50,143
War.

140
00:12:50,778 --> 00:12:52,198
Terrible war.

141
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:53,310
With those...

142
00:12:53,311 --> 00:12:55,771
Orphan... and motherless child.

143
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,192
This was the uprising
that brought our land.

144
00:12:59,859 --> 00:13:03,341
13 Districts rebel against
the country that fed them.

145
00:13:04,697 --> 00:13:06,075
Protected them.

146
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:12,046
Then came the peace.

147
00:13:12,245 --> 00:13:13,333
Hard fought.

148
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:14,338
Solely won.

149
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:15,268
The people.

150
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:19,022
Rose up from the ashes
and a new era was born.

151
00:13:20,044 --> 00:13:21,878
The freedom has a cost.

152
00:13:22,056 --> 00:13:23,663
And the traitors was defeated.

153
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,508
Peace-War as a nation.

154
00:13:25,612 --> 00:13:28,458
We would never know
this treason again.

155
00:13:28,495 --> 00:13:30,543
And so, it was decreed...

156
00:13:30,742 --> 00:13:31,804
That each year.

157
00:13:31,805 --> 00:13:35,496
The various districts of Panem
would offer up in tribute...

158
00:13:35,533 --> 00:13:37,134
One young man and woman.

159
00:13:37,171 --> 00:13:38,738
To fight to the death.

160
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:42,690
And it peg you to honor,
courage and sacrifice.

161
00:13:42,727 --> 00:13:44,049
The lone victor...

162
00:13:44,085 --> 00:13:45,336
Bathe in riches...

163
00:13:45,371 --> 00:13:48,810
Will serve as our reminder
of our generosity.

164
00:13:48,846 --> 00:13:50,166
.. and our forgiveness.

165
00:13:50,385 --> 00:13:52,981
This is how we remember our past.

166
00:13:53,524 --> 00:13:56,963
This is how we safe guard our future.

167
00:13:57,222 --> 00:13:58,816
I just love that.

168
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,120
Now, the time has come to...

169
00:14:04,157 --> 00:14:05,350
...select...

170
00:14:05,351 --> 00:14:09,466
...one courageous
young man and woman.

171
00:14:10,363 --> 00:14:13,803
For the honor of
representing District

172
00:14:13,804 --> 00:14:17,242
12 in the 74th
Annual Hunger Games.

173
00:14:18,523 --> 00:14:19,836
As usual...

174
00:14:20,545 --> 00:14:21,920
...ladies first.

175
00:14:47,523 --> 00:14:49,797
Primrose Everdeen!

176
00:14:56,894 --> 00:14:58,144
Where are you?

177
00:14:59,384 --> 00:15:00,636
Come on up.

178
00:15:01,512 --> 00:15:02,907
Well, come on up!

179
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:26,709
Prim!

180
00:15:26,874 --> 00:15:28,126
Prim!

181
00:15:28,805 --> 00:15:29,542
No!

182
00:15:29,543 --> 00:15:31,826
I volunteer!

183
00:15:33,316 --> 00:15:34,859
I volunteer as Tribute.

184
00:15:36,745 --> 00:15:38,966
I believe we have a volunteer.

185
00:15:40,686 --> 00:15:43,174
- You need to get out of here.
- No!

186
00:15:43,185 --> 00:15:44,242
- Go find mom!
- No!

187
00:15:44,269 --> 00:15:45,540
- Prim, go find mom!
- No!

188
00:15:45,562 --> 00:15:46,348
I'm so sorry!

189
00:15:46,349 --> 00:15:47,253
No!

190
00:15:47,254 --> 00:15:48,507
Noo!

191
00:15:48,803 --> 00:15:51,636
Noo! Nooo! Noooo!

192
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:55,899
In mad of turn of events
here on District 12.

193
00:15:59,337 --> 00:16:03,110
District 12's very first volunteer.
Big breath.

194
00:16:07,435 --> 00:16:08,685
Come on dear.

195
00:16:18,648 --> 00:16:20,342
What's your name?

196
00:16:20,378 --> 00:16:22,036
Katniss Everdeen.

197
00:16:22,713 --> 00:16:25,037
Well, I bet my hat
that was your sister.

198
00:16:25,074 --> 00:16:26,324
Wasn't it?

199
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:28,269
Yes.

200
00:16:29,256 --> 00:16:34,488
Let's have a big hand for our very
first volunteer, Katniss Everdeen.

201
00:16:47,745 --> 00:16:49,007
And now...

202
00:16:49,277 --> 00:16:50,673
...for the boys.

203
00:17:00,835 --> 00:17:02,450
Peeta Mellark.

204
00:17:26,158 --> 00:17:27,480
Here we are.

205
00:17:27,865 --> 00:17:31,462
Our Tributes from District 12.

206
00:17:32,495 --> 00:17:34,547
Well, go on you two. Shake hands.

207
00:17:47,262 --> 00:17:49,428
Happy Hunger Games.

208
00:17:49,563 --> 00:17:53,669
And be the odds be
ever in your favor.

209
00:18:06,733 --> 00:18:08,246
You have 3 minutes.

210
00:18:14,077 --> 00:18:16,158
Prim, Prim, its okay.

211
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:18,209
Shh. Prim, I don't have much time.

212
00:18:18,376 --> 00:18:19,774
Prim, listen.

213
00:18:20,723 --> 00:18:21,859
You're gonna be okay.

214
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,285
Don't take any extra food for money.

215
00:18:23,322 --> 00:18:25,480
That doesn't worth putting
your name in more times, okay?

216
00:18:25,517 --> 00:18:26,770
Listen, Prim.

217
00:18:26,796 --> 00:18:29,319
Gale will bring you game.
He stuck cheese from your coat.

218
00:18:30,653 --> 00:18:32,453
Just try to win. Maybe you can.

219
00:18:34,828 --> 00:18:36,854
Maybe I can, I am smart you know?

220
00:18:37,343 --> 00:18:38,657
You can hunt.

221
00:18:38,898 --> 00:18:40,150
Exactly.

222
00:18:46,431 --> 00:18:47,714
It's to protect you.

223
00:18:53,535 --> 00:18:54,787
Thank you.

224
00:19:08,163 --> 00:19:09,604
You can't turn out again.

225
00:19:10,512 --> 00:19:11,468
I won't

226
00:19:11,469 --> 00:19:12,889
No, you can't.

227
00:19:13,067 --> 00:19:14,172
Not like when dad died.

228
00:19:14,173 --> 00:19:16,037
I won't be here anymore.
Your all she has.

229
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:19,109
No matter what you feel, you will
be there for her. You understand?

230
00:19:20,685 --> 00:19:21,936
Don't cry.

231
00:19:24,534 --> 00:19:26,349
Don't cry. Don't.

232
00:19:30,022 --> 00:19:30,888
It's time.

233
00:19:30,889 --> 00:19:32,995
It's okay. Prim, it's okay.

234
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,080
No! No!

235
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,251
I promise Prim.

236
00:19:54,832 --> 00:19:56,047
I'm fine.

237
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,027
You don't know.

238
00:19:57,028 --> 00:19:58,280
I am.

239
00:19:58,817 --> 00:20:00,221
Listen to me.

240
00:20:00,259 --> 00:20:02,814
You're stronger than they are.
You are.

241
00:20:03,273 --> 00:20:06,142
Get to a bow. What will if you
show them how good you are?

242
00:20:06,653 --> 00:20:08,593
They just want a good show.
That's all they want.

243
00:20:09,148 --> 00:20:10,456
If they don't have a bow,
then you make one.

244
00:20:10,457 --> 00:20:11,765
Okay? You know how to hunt.

245
00:20:12,496 --> 00:20:13,746
They're not animals.

246
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:16,877
It's no different Katniss.

247
00:20:18,869 --> 00:20:21,249
There's 24 of us Gale
and only one comes out.

248
00:20:21,834 --> 00:20:22,876
Yeah.

249
00:20:22,877 --> 00:20:24,254
And it's gonna be you.

250
00:20:24,754 --> 00:20:25,608
Okay.

251
00:20:25,609 --> 00:20:26,832
Take care of them Gale.

252
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:28,084
Whatever you do, don't
let them starve.

253
00:20:28,088 --> 00:20:28,893
Let's go!

254
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,377
I'll see you soon okay?

255
00:20:33,085 --> 00:20:34,380
You two haven't had trip?

256
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,053
Crystal chandeliers.

257
00:20:36,089 --> 00:20:37,414
Platinum donuts.

258
00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:42,427
200 miles per hour and you
can barely feel a thing.

259
00:21:42,463 --> 00:21:44,985
I think its rather a wonderful
thing is about this opportunity...

260
00:21:45,021 --> 00:21:48,693
That even though you're here and even
though it's just for a little while.

261
00:21:48,827 --> 00:21:51,955
You get to enjoy all of this.

262
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:57,484
I'm going to find Haymitch.

263
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,997
He's probably in the back car.

264
00:22:11,648 --> 00:22:12,898
You even met him?

265
00:22:16,142 --> 00:22:17,394
Haymitch?

266
00:22:22,045 --> 00:22:23,662
You know, Katniss, he is our mentor.

267
00:22:23,755 --> 00:22:25,225
He did witness things once.

268
00:22:32,745 --> 00:22:33,955
Look!

269
00:22:33,956 --> 00:22:35,866
You know if you don't want to talk,
I understand. But I just don't

270
00:22:35,867 --> 00:22:37,772
think there's anything wrong of
getting a little bit of help.

271
00:23:03,305 --> 00:23:04,712
Congratulations.

272
00:23:23,925 --> 00:23:25,175
Where's the ice?

273
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,274
I don't... I don't know.

274
00:23:40,778 --> 00:23:42,708
Okay, so uh...

275
00:23:43,646 --> 00:23:45,083
...so when do we start?

276
00:23:45,121 --> 00:23:45,930
Whoah.

277
00:23:45,931 --> 00:23:47,506
Why so eager?

278
00:23:48,016 --> 00:23:51,105
Most of you are in such a hurry.

279
00:23:51,632 --> 00:23:52,755
Yeah.
I wanna know what the plan is.

280
00:23:52,756 --> 00:23:53,912
You're our mentor,
you're supposed to go...

281
00:23:53,913 --> 00:23:55,162
Encore.

282
00:23:55,535 --> 00:23:56,513
Yeah.

283
00:23:56,514 --> 00:23:59,383
Our mentor is supposed to tell us how
to get sponsors and give us advice.

284
00:23:59,676 --> 00:24:01,471
Oh, okay.

285
00:24:01,897 --> 00:24:03,149
Ummm...

286
00:24:03,377 --> 00:24:07,666
Embrace the probability
of your immanent death.

287
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:09,701
I know.

288
00:24:09,712 --> 00:24:10,983
Can your heart...

289
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:14,197
that there's nothing I
can do to save you.

290
00:24:15,395 --> 00:24:17,085
So why are you here then?

291
00:24:18,524 --> 00:24:19,777
The refreshments.

292
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,174
Okay, I think that's enough.

293
00:24:25,721 --> 00:24:27,820
You made me spill my drink.

294
00:24:27,856 --> 00:24:29,612
Over my new pants.

295
00:24:30,698 --> 00:24:31,637
You know...

296
00:24:31,639 --> 00:24:35,163
I think I'll go finish
this in my room.

297
00:24:50,654 --> 00:24:52,489
I shouldn't have come around.

298
00:24:52,525 --> 00:24:53,846
What? It's no use.

299
00:24:53,897 --> 00:24:55,180
I'm gonna go talk to him.

300
00:25:02,909 --> 00:25:05,914
We have two... 16 year olds.

301
00:25:09,304 --> 00:25:10,556
Yes.

302
00:25:10,661 --> 00:25:12,558
Do you remember this year?

303
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,457
Aww. One of my favorite years.

304
00:25:14,488 --> 00:25:15,975
And one of my favorite arenas.

305
00:25:16,011 --> 00:25:18,766
The use of the rubble, the ruin city.

306
00:25:19,568 --> 00:25:20,683
Very exciting.

307
00:25:20,684 --> 00:25:22,239
From this moment here...

308
00:25:22,275 --> 00:25:23,209
...this moment...

309
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:25,296
.. is the moment that
you never forget.

310
00:25:25,332 --> 00:25:26,276
The moment...

311
00:25:26,276 --> 00:25:27,528
...when a Tribute...

312
00:25:27,924 --> 00:25:29,437
...becomes a victor.

313
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:06,107
You'd freeze to death first.

314
00:26:06,144 --> 00:26:07,589
Because I didn't light a fire.

315
00:26:07,625 --> 00:26:09,347
Now that's a good
way to get killed.

316
00:26:09,383 --> 00:26:11,068
What's a good way to get killed?

317
00:26:12,049 --> 00:26:13,499
Oh! Joy.

318
00:26:13,644 --> 00:26:15,334
Why don't you join us?

319
00:26:16,096 --> 00:26:18,778
I'm just saving a life-saving advice.

320
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:21,562
Like what?

321
00:26:21,563 --> 00:26:23,868
I wa... I was just asking
bout how to find shelter.

322
00:26:24,337 --> 00:26:28,425
Which would come in handy if
in fact you are still alive.

323
00:26:30,489 --> 00:26:31,888
How do you find shelter?

324
00:26:32,713 --> 00:26:34,116
Pass the jam.

325
00:26:34,152 --> 00:26:35,789
How do you find shelter?

326
00:26:36,125 --> 00:26:39,012
Give me a chance to
wake up sweetheart.

327
00:26:39,974 --> 00:26:41,746
This mentoring is very...

328
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,084
...tax and stuff.

329
00:26:49,528 --> 00:26:51,478
Can you pass the marmalade?

330
00:26:52,814 --> 00:26:54,827
That is mahogany.

331
00:26:55,358 --> 00:26:56,537
Look at you!

332
00:26:56,538 --> 00:26:59,051
Just killed a... place mat!

333
00:27:00,491 --> 00:27:02,535
You really wanna know
how to stay alive?

334
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:06,582
You get people to like you.

335
00:27:07,604 --> 00:27:08,858
Oh!

336
00:27:08,981 --> 00:27:10,871
Not what you're expecting.

337
00:27:12,382 --> 00:27:14,595
When you're in the
middle of the games...

338
00:27:14,631 --> 00:27:17,400
...and you're starving or freezing,

339
00:27:17,438 --> 00:27:18,742
some water,

340
00:27:18,778 --> 00:27:21,374
a knife or even some
matches can mean

341
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:23,972
the difference between
life and death.

342
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:26,997
And those things only
comes from Sponsors.

343
00:27:27,488 --> 00:27:32,328
And to get Sponsors, you have
to make people like you.

344
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:35,187
And right now, sweetheart?

345
00:27:36,103 --> 00:27:38,635
You're not off to a
really good start.

346
00:27:39,118 --> 00:27:40,590
There it is.

347
00:27:45,898 --> 00:27:47,149
It's huge.

348
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,030
That's incredible.

349
00:28:24,677 --> 00:28:27,165
Come on.

350
00:28:31,748 --> 00:28:33,374
Better keep this knife.

351
00:28:33,825 --> 00:28:35,255
He knows what he's doing.

352
00:28:46,048 --> 00:28:47,849
So now that you've seen...

353
00:28:47,885 --> 00:28:50,631
...what do you think of
this years cropful troops?

354
00:28:50,704 --> 00:28:53,385
Are there any surprises that
we can expect this year?

355
00:28:54,198 --> 00:28:56,573
It's really hard to tell from
a Reaping but I think...

356
00:28:57,306 --> 00:28:58,715
...this is a very interesting mix.

357
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,587
Yes.

358
00:28:59,588 --> 00:29:01,849
Whenever you have a volunteer
from an outline district,

359
00:29:01,921 --> 00:29:03,595
it's something you can't ignore.

360
00:29:31,876 --> 00:29:33,137
What's that?

361
00:29:33,916 --> 00:29:35,179
What's that?

362
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:37,616
We were just saying
we might need to hose

363
00:29:37,617 --> 00:29:39,393
you down again before
we take you to Cinna.

364
00:29:46,343 --> 00:29:49,140
That was all the bravest
thing I've ever seen.

365
00:29:50,991 --> 00:29:52,034
I am Cinna.

366
00:29:52,035 --> 00:29:53,280
Katniss.

367
00:29:53,281 --> 00:29:55,252
I'm sorry that this happened to you.

368
00:29:55,288 --> 00:29:57,393
And I'm here to help
you in any way I can.

369
00:29:59,948 --> 00:30:01,987
Most people just congratulate me.

370
00:30:02,209 --> 00:30:03,891
I don't see the point in that.

371
00:30:04,862 --> 00:30:06,118
Thank you girl.

372
00:30:14,706 --> 00:30:15,965
What's this?

373
00:30:16,512 --> 00:30:18,304
That's a... Mocking Jay.

374
00:30:20,778 --> 00:30:22,037
How much?

375
00:30:24,103 --> 00:30:25,076
You keep it.

376
00:30:25,077 --> 00:30:26,336
It's yours.

377
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:27,615
Thank you.

378
00:30:36,236 --> 00:30:37,488
So tonight...

379
00:30:37,611 --> 00:30:38,966
...they have the Tribute Parade.

380
00:30:39,551 --> 00:30:41,655
Let me take you out and
show you after the wurl.

381
00:30:42,897 --> 00:30:44,607
So you're here to
make me look pretty.

382
00:30:44,643 --> 00:30:46,317
I'm here to help you
make an impression.

383
00:30:47,223 --> 00:30:49,976
Now usually, they dress people in
their close to their district.

384
00:30:50,011 --> 00:30:51,194
Yeah. We're called minors.

385
00:30:51,195 --> 00:30:52,466
Yeah. But I don't want to do that.

386
00:30:53,728 --> 00:30:55,616
I'm gonna do something that
they're gonna remember.

387
00:30:56,219 --> 00:30:58,242
Did they explain about
trying to get sponsors?

388
00:30:58,951 --> 00:31:01,139
Yeah, but I'm not very
good at making friends.

389
00:31:01,494 --> 00:31:02,745
We'll see.

390
00:31:04,633 --> 00:31:06,780
I just think, somebody that brave...

391
00:31:08,031 --> 00:31:10,690
...shouldn't be dressed up on some
stupid costume as should they.

392
00:31:14,484 --> 00:31:15,736
I hope not.

393
00:31:24,982 --> 00:31:28,359
It's not real fire. These suits are
built so you won't feel a thing.

394
00:31:28,757 --> 00:31:30,005
That's better on me.

395
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:31,341
The idea...

396
00:31:31,561 --> 00:31:32,811
You ready?

397
00:31:32,821 --> 00:31:33,811
Don't be afraid.

398
00:31:33,812 --> 00:31:35,062
I'm not afraid.

399
00:31:55,328 --> 00:31:58,129
Over one hundred
thousand people, craning

400
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:00,925
to get a glimpse this
year's Tributes...

401
00:32:00,963 --> 00:32:04,014
...and the Sponsors get to see
the Tributes for the first time.

402
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:06,921
The importance of this moment
cannot be over stated.

403
00:32:11,977 --> 00:32:13,488
They're nice.

404
00:32:13,687 --> 00:32:15,866
First cheered on my counting in 15...

405
00:32:15,902 --> 00:32:18,553
...14... 13...

406
00:32:21,088 --> 00:32:22,883
Here they are. Here they are.

407
00:32:22,918 --> 00:32:24,518
This year's Tributes.

408
00:32:25,216 --> 00:32:26,592
The most exciting run...

409
00:32:26,716 --> 00:32:28,817
...it just gives you goosebumps.

410
00:32:28,854 --> 00:32:30,884
Don't you love, how the stylist...

411
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,101
...they so clearly
are able to reflect

412
00:32:33,102 --> 00:32:35,287
the character of each district.

413
00:32:36,736 --> 00:32:37,997
There's District 4!

414
00:32:38,862 --> 00:32:39,665
Fishing.

415
00:32:39,665 --> 00:32:40,879
I get it. I like it.

416
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,131
That's very good.

417
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,167
And behind them...

418
00:32:44,168 --> 00:32:48,006
.. we have two power plant workers.

419
00:32:48,041 --> 00:32:49,292
And then...

420
00:32:50,143 --> 00:32:51,966
...what is that in the background?

421
00:33:19,374 --> 00:33:20,644
Come on. They'll love it.

422
00:33:28,704 --> 00:33:30,396
Now see that? I love that.

423
00:33:30,432 --> 00:33:32,701
Two young people,
holding their hands up!

424
00:33:32,738 --> 00:33:34,670
Saying, "I'm proud,
I'm from District 12!

425
00:33:34,672 --> 00:33:36,605
We will not be overlooked!"

426
00:33:36,687 --> 00:33:37,965
I love that.

427
00:33:38,002 --> 00:33:41,203
We're gonna sure we'll be paying
attention to them right now!

428
00:33:43,266 --> 00:33:44,665
And we're ready.

429
00:33:45,142 --> 00:33:46,925
President Snow, you're live!

430
00:34:16,875 --> 00:34:18,126
Welcome.

431
00:34:21,869 --> 00:34:23,216
Welcome.

432
00:34:24,591 --> 00:34:25,842
Tributes.

433
00:34:26,747 --> 00:34:28,022
We welcome you.

434
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:30,970
We salute...

435
00:34:31,481 --> 00:34:32,731
...the courage...

436
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:34,943
...and your sacrifice.

437
00:34:39,173 --> 00:34:40,644
And we wish you...

438
00:34:42,646 --> 00:34:44,336
...happy Hunger Games.

439
00:34:44,992 --> 00:34:49,589
And may the odds be
ever in your favor.

440
00:35:01,835 --> 00:35:03,856
That was amazing.

441
00:35:03,892 --> 00:35:07,130
Oh, we are anybody's
going be talking about.

442
00:35:07,358 --> 00:35:08,607
So brave.

443
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:10,740
Are you sure you're
spinning up a new flame?

444
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:12,125
Fake flame?

445
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,913
Are you sure?

446
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:22,757
That's uh...

447
00:35:23,059 --> 00:35:24,547
...let's go upstairs.

448
00:35:29,291 --> 00:35:32,450
So each of the districts
got their own floor and

449
00:35:32,451 --> 00:35:35,607
because you're from 12,
you get the penthouse.

450
00:35:42,204 --> 00:35:43,453
Come on.

451
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:49,611
So this is the living room.

452
00:35:50,289 --> 00:35:52,680
I know!

453
00:35:53,307 --> 00:35:55,656
Now, your rooms are right over here.

454
00:35:55,971 --> 00:36:00,548
Why don't you go clean yourselves
up a little before dinner.

455
00:37:17,013 --> 00:37:18,260
In two weeks...

456
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,663
...23 of you will be dead.

457
00:37:21,227 --> 00:37:23,056
One of you will be alive.

458
00:37:23,192 --> 00:37:25,518
Who that is depends
on how well you pay

459
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:27,845
attention over the
next four days.

460
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:30,152
Particularly to what
I'm about to say.

461
00:37:30,309 --> 00:37:33,219
First. No fighting with
the other Tributes.

462
00:37:33,255 --> 00:37:35,764
You'll have plenty of time
for that in the arena.

463
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:40,341
There are four compulsory exercises,
the rest will be individual training.

464
00:37:40,377 --> 00:37:41,494
My advice is...

465
00:37:41,495 --> 00:37:43,456
Don't ignore the survival skills.

466
00:37:43,493 --> 00:37:45,917
Everybody wants to
grab a sword but most

467
00:37:45,918 --> 00:37:48,343
of you wil die from
natural causes.

468
00:37:48,379 --> 00:37:50,144
10% from infection.

469
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,910
20% from dehydration.

470
00:37:52,087 --> 00:37:54,761
Exposure can kill as
easily as a knife.

471
00:38:27,226 --> 00:38:28,327
Where's my knife?

472
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:29,345
Where did you put it?

473
00:38:29,346 --> 00:38:30,126
I put my knife...

474
00:38:30,127 --> 00:38:31,377
Don't touch me...

475
00:38:31,502 --> 00:38:33,051
Fuck! You took my knife!

476
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,151
I didn't touch your knife.
I didn't touch your kni...

477
00:38:35,287 --> 00:38:36,108
You liar.

478
00:38:36,109 --> 00:38:37,187
You little punk!

479
00:38:37,188 --> 00:38:38,436
You took my knife.

480
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,564
Get off me.

481
00:38:39,565 --> 00:38:40,813
Just sit here.

482
00:38:42,915 --> 00:38:44,761
I should better wait for the arena.

483
00:38:44,797 --> 00:38:46,879
You're the first one I get
so watch your back huh!

484
00:38:49,803 --> 00:38:51,098
Everybody back in line.

485
00:38:51,134 --> 00:38:52,528
You know you're next to me Cato!

486
00:38:53,212 --> 00:38:54,502
Busy career.

487
00:38:54,617 --> 00:38:55,679
You know what that is?

488
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,790
From District 1.

489
00:38:56,791 --> 00:38:57,762
...and 2.

490
00:38:57,763 --> 00:39:00,314
They've been trying to be
in a special academy till

491
00:39:00,315 --> 00:39:02,863
they're 18 and they volunteer.
By that point...

492
00:39:03,618 --> 00:39:04,623
...they're pretty lethal.

493
00:39:04,624 --> 00:39:07,199
But they don't receive
any special treatment.

494
00:39:07,236 --> 00:39:09,807
In fact, they're staying at the
exact same apartment as you do.

495
00:39:09,944 --> 00:39:12,650
And I don't think left them
out for dessert and you can.

496
00:39:13,877 --> 00:39:15,398
So how good all that?

497
00:39:16,845 --> 00:39:18,624
Obviously, they're pretty good.

498
00:39:18,625 --> 00:39:20,401
They won in almost
several year but...

499
00:39:20,438 --> 00:39:21,697
Almost...

500
00:39:21,891 --> 00:39:23,371
They can be arrogant.

501
00:39:24,284 --> 00:39:28,166
And arrogance can
be a big problem.

502
00:39:30,379 --> 00:39:31,639
I hear you can shoot..

503
00:39:34,699 --> 00:39:35,961
I'm alright.

504
00:39:35,971 --> 00:39:37,396
Actually, better than alright.

505
00:39:37,669 --> 00:39:39,212
I fed her by the squirrels.

506
00:39:40,219 --> 00:39:42,736
He say she hits em right
in the eye, everytime.

507
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:46,272
- Peeta's strong.
- What?

508
00:39:46,281 --> 00:39:47,835
He can throw a 100
pound sack of flour

509
00:39:47,836 --> 00:39:49,176
right in his head. I've seen it.

510
00:39:49,215 --> 00:39:51,689
Okay, well I cannot kill
anybody by a sack of flour.

511
00:39:51,725 --> 00:39:53,324
No, you might have a
better chance at winning

512
00:39:53,325 --> 00:39:54,917
when somebody comes
after you with a knife.

513
00:39:54,954 --> 00:39:57,884
I have no chance of winning.
None! Alright?

514
00:40:03,004 --> 00:40:04,526
It's true.

515
00:40:05,061 --> 00:40:06,319
Everybody knows it.

516
00:40:08,994 --> 00:40:10,423
You know what my mother said?

517
00:40:11,491 --> 00:40:14,038
She said, "District 12 might
finally have a winner!"

518
00:40:15,385 --> 00:40:16,935
But she wasn't talking about me.

519
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,767
She was talking about you.

520
00:40:25,948 --> 00:40:27,311
I'm not very hungry.

521
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:06,923
I'm done too.

522
00:41:49,734 --> 00:41:51,231
Throw that metal
thing over there.

523
00:41:51,607 --> 00:41:52,865
What?

524
00:41:55,428 --> 00:41:56,361
No.

525
00:41:56,362 --> 00:41:57,806
Haymitch says we're not
supposed to show...

526
00:41:57,845 --> 00:41:59,100
I don't care what Haymitch said.

527
00:41:59,104 --> 00:42:01,263
Those guys are looking at
you like you're a meal.

528
00:42:01,577 --> 00:42:02,832
Throw it.

529
00:42:47,444 --> 00:42:48,698
Hi.

530
00:42:49,652 --> 00:42:50,636
Hey.

531
00:42:50,637 --> 00:42:51,893
How did you do that?

532
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:54,207
I uh...

533
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:56,409
I used to take care of the
cakes down at the bakery.

534
00:42:57,623 --> 00:42:58,879
I'll show you.

535
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:02,438
See?

536
00:43:03,214 --> 00:43:04,177
Wow.

537
00:43:04,178 --> 00:43:05,433
Yeah.

538
00:43:06,964 --> 00:43:08,837
I think you have a shadow.

539
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:37,526
Tomorrow.
They will bring you in one by one.

540
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,097
And evaluate you.

541
00:43:39,606 --> 00:43:43,291
This is important because high
ratings will mean Sponsors.

542
00:43:43,328 --> 00:43:45,948
This is the time to
show them everything.

543
00:43:45,984 --> 00:43:48,568
There'll be a bow,
make sure you use it.

544
00:43:48,694 --> 00:43:50,808
Peeta, you make sure
to show your strength.

545
00:43:51,246 --> 00:43:55,344
They'll start with District 1
so the two of you will go last.

546
00:43:56,187 --> 00:43:58,005
Not on my house to put this...

547
00:43:58,041 --> 00:43:59,819
Make sure they remember you!

548
00:44:11,237 --> 00:44:13,431
Katniss Everdeen.

549
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:26,161
Hey Katniss.

550
00:44:27,171 --> 00:44:28,420
Shoot straight.

551
00:45:28,891 --> 00:45:30,532
Katniss Everdeen.

552
00:45:32,125 --> 00:45:33,395
District 12.

553
00:47:24,445 --> 00:47:25,692
Thank you.

554
00:47:25,817 --> 00:47:27,464
For your consideration.

555
00:47:32,864 --> 00:47:34,017
Are you crazy?

556
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:35,136
I just got mad.

557
00:47:35,138 --> 00:47:36,387
Mad?!

558
00:47:37,061 --> 00:47:40,805
You realize that your actions
reflect badly on all of us.

559
00:47:40,841 --> 00:47:42,083
Not just you.

560
00:47:42,084 --> 00:47:43,533
They just want a good
show, it's fine.

561
00:47:43,732 --> 00:47:45,676
How bout just bad manners Cinna?

562
00:47:45,713 --> 00:47:47,071
How bout that?

563
00:47:47,456 --> 00:47:49,006
Well, finally!

564
00:47:49,224 --> 00:47:52,220
I hope you notice, we
have a serious situation.

565
00:47:55,409 --> 00:47:57,510
Nice shooting sweetheart!

566
00:47:58,864 --> 00:48:01,293
Wha.. Wha... What did they...

567
00:48:01,294 --> 00:48:03,721
What did they do when
you shot the apple?

568
00:48:04,141 --> 00:48:05,755
Well, they look pretty startled.

569
00:48:09,198 --> 00:48:11,965
What did you say... "Thanks for... "

570
00:48:12,001 --> 00:48:14,049
...consideration. Genius!

571
00:48:14,891 --> 00:48:15,678
Genius.

572
00:48:15,679 --> 00:48:18,013
How do you think you're
gonna find this funny?

573
00:48:18,014 --> 00:48:20,345
If the game makers decided
to take it out...

574
00:48:20,381 --> 00:48:21,979
On who? On her?

575
00:48:22,602 --> 00:48:23,818
On him?

576
00:48:23,819 --> 00:48:25,192
I think they already have.

577
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:27,962
Loosen your corset and have a drink.

578
00:48:28,254 --> 00:48:31,063
I would have given
anything to see it.

579
00:48:32,135 --> 00:48:35,138
As you know the Tributes
are rated on a scale of

580
00:48:35,139 --> 00:48:38,139
1 to 12 after three days
of careful evaluation.

581
00:48:38,286 --> 00:48:40,717
The game keepers would
like to evaluate...

582
00:48:42,468 --> 00:48:45,513
From District 1, Marvel.

583
00:48:45,551 --> 00:48:48,432
The score of 9.

584
00:48:48,777 --> 00:48:50,945
Cato, the score of 10.

585
00:48:50,986 --> 00:48:53,404
Clove, the score of 10.

586
00:48:54,281 --> 00:48:56,585
Four, score of...

587
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:58,030
From District 7...

588
00:48:58,067 --> 00:48:59,380
From District...

589
00:49:00,421 --> 00:49:03,175
Rue, the score of 7.

590
00:49:05,155 --> 00:49:06,532
From District 12...

591
00:49:08,043 --> 00:49:11,525
Peeta Mellark...

592
00:49:13,474 --> 00:49:14,726
The score of...

593
00:49:15,258 --> 00:49:16,509
8.

594
00:49:17,541 --> 00:49:19,315
Not bad. Bravo.

595
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:25,977
And finally...

596
00:49:28,293 --> 00:49:29,906
From District 12...

597
00:49:31,733 --> 00:49:33,421
Katniss Everdeen...

598
00:49:37,457 --> 00:49:38,948
With the score of...

599
00:49:42,127 --> 00:49:43,378
...eleven.

600
00:49:49,165 --> 00:49:50,540
Congratulations.

601
00:49:51,001 --> 00:49:52,339
I thought they hated me.

602
00:49:52,376 --> 00:49:53,932
They must have like you girl.

603
00:49:53,968 --> 00:49:55,661
To Katniss Everdeen...

604
00:49:55,696 --> 00:49:58,288
The Girl On Fire!

605
00:50:01,259 --> 00:50:02,505
At eleven?

606
00:50:02,898 --> 00:50:03,910
She earned it.

607
00:50:03,911 --> 00:50:06,060
She shot an arrow at your head.

608
00:50:06,095 --> 00:50:07,338
Well, t'was an apple.

609
00:50:07,367 --> 00:50:08,606
...near your head.

610
00:50:09,445 --> 00:50:10,689
Sit down.

611
00:50:15,985 --> 00:50:17,226
Seneca...

612
00:50:17,993 --> 00:50:19,796
...why do you think we have a winner?

613
00:50:21,514 --> 00:50:22,759
What do you mean?

614
00:50:23,658 --> 00:50:25,141
I mean...

615
00:50:25,418 --> 00:50:28,071
...why do we have a winner?

616
00:50:30,144 --> 00:50:32,075
I mean if we just
wanted to intimidate

617
00:50:32,076 --> 00:50:34,002
the Districts, why not round up

618
00:50:34,003 --> 00:50:37,860
24 of them at random and execute
them all at once. Way a lot faster...

619
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:41,952
Hope.

620
00:50:42,845 --> 00:50:44,087
Hope?

621
00:50:44,305 --> 00:50:45,549
Hope.

622
00:50:45,714 --> 00:50:49,558
It is the only thing...
stronger than fear.

623
00:50:50,241 --> 00:50:52,030
A little hope is effective.

624
00:50:52,066 --> 00:50:53,816
A lot of hope is dangerous.

625
00:50:54,271 --> 00:50:57,702
It's track is fine..
As long as it's contained.

626
00:51:00,455 --> 00:51:01,701
So...

627
00:51:02,237 --> 00:51:05,575
So... contain it!

628
00:51:36,493 --> 00:51:37,751
Right.

629
00:51:38,126 --> 00:51:41,400
If she's staring at all my jewels,
she can't take her eye from...

630
00:51:41,838 --> 00:51:43,454
Frankly... it was rude.

631
00:51:43,492 --> 00:51:45,988
Oh, Haymitch.
You should join us.

632
00:51:45,989 --> 00:51:48,485
We're having some of
your favorite dish.

633
00:51:48,859 --> 00:51:50,303
Oh, lovely.

634
00:51:54,092 --> 00:51:55,054
Where's Peeta?

635
00:51:55,055 --> 00:51:57,837
He's in his room. Now listen...

636
00:51:58,268 --> 00:51:59,769
Tomorrow's the last day.

637
00:51:59,806 --> 00:52:02,710
When they let us walk with
our own Tributes right

638
00:52:02,711 --> 00:52:05,614
before the game so you and
I will be going down at 9.

639
00:52:07,287 --> 00:52:08,541
Well, what about him?

640
00:52:09,202 --> 00:52:12,457
No, he says he wants to be
trained on his own from now on.

641
00:52:13,932 --> 00:52:15,184
What?

642
00:52:15,593 --> 00:52:18,357
It's kind of thing does happen
at this point if there's...

643
00:52:19,278 --> 00:52:20,856
...only one winner. Right?

644
00:52:27,189 --> 00:52:29,143
We should have some
chocolate covered stoke.

645
00:52:34,169 --> 00:52:37,757
Ladies and gentlemen.
Your master of ceremonies...

646
00:52:37,794 --> 00:52:42,557
Caesar Flickerman!

647
00:52:45,674 --> 00:52:47,442
Thank you!

648
00:52:48,482 --> 00:52:51,966
Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome.

649
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:55,449
To the 74th Annual Hunger Games.

650
00:52:55,584 --> 00:52:59,634
Now, there are five minutes they
are all going to be out here.

651
00:52:59,831 --> 00:53:02,717
All of the Tributes
that you heard about.

652
00:53:02,753 --> 00:53:04,540
Are you excited?

653
00:53:04,577 --> 00:53:06,329
Let me hear it!

654
00:53:09,662 --> 00:53:10,912
Amazing.

655
00:53:12,761 --> 00:53:14,220
I don't feel amazing.

656
00:53:14,336 --> 00:53:15,965
Don't you know how
beautiful you look?

657
00:53:16,004 --> 00:53:17,763
No. And I don't know
how to make people

658
00:53:17,764 --> 00:53:19,522
like me, how do you
make people like you?

659
00:53:19,594 --> 00:53:20,592
Why do you made me like you?

660
00:53:20,594 --> 00:53:22,323
That's different.
I wasn't trying.

661
00:53:22,384 --> 00:53:23,446
Exactly.

662
00:53:23,447 --> 00:53:26,508
Just be yourself.
I'll be there the whole time.

663
00:53:26,546 --> 00:53:28,588
...and just pretend
you're talking to me.

664
00:53:28,859 --> 00:53:30,111
Okay?

665
00:53:30,548 --> 00:53:31,339
Okay.

666
00:53:31,424 --> 00:53:34,164
Let's see if she
does indeed shine.

667
00:53:34,166 --> 00:53:36,909
Let's have a warm round
of applause for Glimmer.

668
00:53:41,443 --> 00:53:43,155
Glimmer, are you prepared?

669
00:53:43,351 --> 00:53:44,930
Yes Caesar, I am prepared.

670
00:53:44,965 --> 00:53:46,503
I like it, that's just...

671
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:54,563
Big round of applause.

672
00:53:56,919 --> 00:53:58,170
Marvel!

673
00:54:00,913 --> 00:54:02,666
Welcome Clove.

674
00:54:02,717 --> 00:54:04,062
It's an honor to
represent my district.

675
00:54:04,098 --> 00:54:04,883
So you're a fighter?

676
00:54:04,884 --> 00:54:07,337
I'm prepared, vicious
and I'm ready to go.

677
00:54:08,401 --> 00:54:09,654
Cato!

678
00:54:34,293 --> 00:54:36,065
From District 12...

679
00:54:36,222 --> 00:54:38,387
You know her...

680
00:54:38,422 --> 00:54:42,989
...as the girl on fire!

681
00:54:43,083 --> 00:54:47,234
Where we know it's Katniss Everdeen!

682
00:55:15,994 --> 00:55:17,245
What?

683
00:55:18,589 --> 00:55:20,384
I think someone's a little nervous.

684
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:24,905
I said that was quite and
entrance that you've

685
00:55:24,906 --> 00:55:27,290
made at the Tribute's
Parade the other day.

686
00:55:27,325 --> 00:55:28,575
Do you want to tell us about it?

687
00:55:30,195 --> 00:55:31,582
Well, I was just...

688
00:55:31,886 --> 00:55:33,908
...hoping that I
wouldn't burned it up!

689
00:55:42,322 --> 00:55:43,949
When you came out of that chariot...

690
00:55:43,988 --> 00:55:45,239
I have to say...

691
00:55:45,429 --> 00:55:47,632
My heart... stopped.

692
00:55:47,769 --> 00:55:50,166
To earn you experiences as well.

693
00:55:50,583 --> 00:55:51,834
My heart stopped.

694
00:55:54,741 --> 00:55:56,106
So did mine.

695
00:55:58,735 --> 00:56:00,729
Now tell me bout the flames...
are they real?

696
00:56:01,448 --> 00:56:02,698
Yes.

697
00:56:07,194 --> 00:56:08,997
In fact I'm wearing them today.

698
00:56:09,841 --> 00:56:11,094
Would you like to see?

699
00:56:12,034 --> 00:56:13,283
Wait, wait, wait.

700
00:56:13,763 --> 00:56:15,014
Is it safe?

701
00:56:16,609 --> 00:56:17,904
What do you think folks?

702
00:56:19,699 --> 00:56:21,189
I think that's a yes!

703
00:56:54,952 --> 00:56:56,445
That was really something.

704
00:56:56,508 --> 00:56:58,528
Katniss, that was something.

705
00:56:59,239 --> 00:57:00,613
Thank you for that.

706
00:57:02,856 --> 00:57:04,483
I have one more question for you.

707
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:08,174
It's about your sister...

708
00:57:10,833 --> 00:57:13,963
We are all very moved,
I think when...

709
00:57:14,703 --> 00:57:17,167
...you volunteered for
her at the Reaping.

710
00:57:19,268 --> 00:57:20,866
Does she come to say goodbye to you.

711
00:57:21,910 --> 00:57:23,162
Yes.

712
00:57:23,399 --> 00:57:25,026
She did.

713
00:57:27,666 --> 00:57:29,375
And what did you say to her?

714
00:57:29,823 --> 00:57:31,075
In the end?

715
00:57:33,774 --> 00:57:35,819
I told her that I would try to win.

716
00:57:37,614 --> 00:57:39,522
That I will try to win for her.

717
00:57:40,939 --> 00:57:42,492
Of course you did.

718
00:57:44,570 --> 00:57:46,049
And try you will.

719
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:50,522
Ladies and gentlemen,
from District 12,

720
00:57:50,523 --> 00:57:53,778
Katniss Everdeen,
The Girl On Fire!

721
00:57:59,903 --> 00:58:01,086
You did it darling.

722
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:02,263
That was incredible.

723
00:58:02,265 --> 00:58:03,515
Thank you.

724
00:58:03,873 --> 00:58:06,226
Nice job sweetheart.

725
00:58:06,913 --> 00:58:08,133
Thank you.

726
00:58:08,133 --> 00:58:09,900
Nice dress too.

727
00:58:10,733 --> 00:58:12,564
Are yours?

728
00:58:12,598 --> 00:58:14,392
Peeta Mellark!

729
00:58:20,712 --> 00:58:22,781
Peeta, welcome.

730
00:58:23,133 --> 00:58:25,760
How are you finding the Capitol?
Don't say with a map.

731
00:58:27,097 --> 00:58:28,557
Uh, it's uh... different.

732
00:58:28,593 --> 00:58:29,831
It's very different.

733
00:58:29,832 --> 00:58:32,206
Different? In what are?
Give us an example.

734
00:58:32,693 --> 00:58:35,388
Uh okay, well the
showers here are weird.

735
00:58:35,463 --> 00:58:36,224
Showers?

736
00:58:36,225 --> 00:58:37,019
Yes.

737
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:38,267
We have different showers.

738
00:58:38,303 --> 00:58:39,992
I have a question for you Caesar.

739
00:58:40,028 --> 00:58:41,679
Do I smell like roses to you?

740
00:58:44,082 --> 00:58:45,334
Um...

741
00:58:47,526 --> 00:58:48,296
Do I?

742
00:58:48,297 --> 00:58:49,092
Yeah.

743
00:58:49,093 --> 00:58:50,359
Do I smell like it?

744
00:58:56,723 --> 00:58:58,080
You definitely smell
better than I do.

745
00:58:58,116 --> 00:58:59,368
Well I live here longer.

746
00:59:06,088 --> 00:59:07,082
So Peeta...

747
00:59:07,083 --> 00:59:08,336
...tell me.

748
00:59:08,556 --> 00:59:10,646
Is there a special girl back home?

749
00:59:11,074 --> 00:59:13,254
No, not really.

750
00:59:13,290 --> 00:59:16,196
No? I don't believe it for a second.

751
00:59:16,235 --> 00:59:19,345
Look at that face.
Handsome man like you... Peeta.

752
00:59:20,705 --> 00:59:21,959
Tell me.

753
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:25,104
Well, there a...

754
00:59:25,771 --> 00:59:27,385
There's this one girl that...

755
00:59:27,423 --> 00:59:29,001
I had a crush on forever.

756
00:59:30,222 --> 00:59:34,044
But I don't think she actually
recognize me until the Reaping.

757
00:59:36,582 --> 00:59:37,740
Well...

758
00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:39,229
I'll tell you what Peeta.

759
00:59:40,543 --> 00:59:41,797
You go out there...

760
00:59:42,592 --> 00:59:43,972
...and you win this thing.

761
00:59:44,305 --> 00:59:45,667
And when you get home.

762
00:59:45,704 --> 00:59:47,638
She'll have to go out with you.

763
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:49,465
Right folks?

764
00:59:52,712 --> 00:59:54,329
Thanks but I uh...

765
00:59:54,331 --> 00:59:55,938
I don't think winnings
gonna help me at all.

766
00:59:56,264 --> 00:59:57,518
And why not?

767
01:00:01,143 --> 01:00:02,701
Because she came here with me.

768
01:00:07,410 --> 01:00:09,062
Well, that's bad luck.

769
01:00:10,146 --> 01:00:11,443
Yeah. It is.

770
01:00:13,241 --> 01:00:15,246
And I wish you all the best of luck.

771
01:00:15,486 --> 01:00:16,739
Thank you.

772
01:00:17,197 --> 01:00:18,453
Peeta Mellark.

773
01:00:19,761 --> 01:00:21,055
District 12!

774
01:00:25,229 --> 01:00:27,045
What the hell is that?!

775
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:29,195
You don't talk to me and you
say you have a crush on me?

776
01:00:29,232 --> 01:00:31,311
You say you wanna train alone...
is that how you wanna play?

777
01:00:31,345 --> 01:00:32,764
Stop! Stop it!

778
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,186
Start right now.

779
01:00:35,906 --> 01:00:36,953
He did you a favor.

780
01:00:36,954 --> 01:00:37,932
He made me look weak.

781
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:39,576
He made you look desirable.

782
01:00:39,612 --> 01:00:42,006
Which in your case,
can't hurt sweetheart!

783
01:00:42,042 --> 01:00:43,185
He's right Katniss.

784
01:00:43,186 --> 01:00:44,415
Of course, I'm right.

785
01:00:44,434 --> 01:00:47,854
Now I can sell the star cross
lovers from District 12.

786
01:00:47,888 --> 01:00:49,297
We are not star cross lovers.

787
01:00:49,333 --> 01:00:50,882
It's a television show.

788
01:00:51,293 --> 01:00:54,071
And being in love with
that boy might just get

789
01:00:54,073 --> 01:00:56,852
you Sponsors which could
save your damn life.

790
01:00:58,491 --> 01:01:01,112
Okay...
why don't you get out of here?

791
01:01:01,632 --> 01:01:04,456
Maybe acting to live save you
both to one piece tomorrow.

792
01:01:04,882 --> 01:01:06,105
Manners.

793
01:01:37,416 --> 01:01:38,660
You too?

794
01:01:39,937 --> 01:01:41,463
Oh, hey.

795
01:01:42,226 --> 01:01:43,420
Can't sleep?

796
01:01:43,421 --> 01:01:45,537
No, of course not.

797
01:01:47,604 --> 01:01:49,428
I'm sorry I went after you.

798
01:01:52,419 --> 01:01:53,871
You know I meant that
as a compliment.

799
01:01:55,259 --> 01:01:56,505
I know.

800
01:02:07,593 --> 01:02:08,842
Listen...

801
01:02:11,022 --> 01:02:12,263
Yeah?

802
01:02:16,476 --> 01:02:18,154
I just don't wanna change me.

803
01:02:20,867 --> 01:02:22,126
So tonight...

804
01:02:22,249 --> 01:02:23,612
...they have the Tribute Parade.

805
01:02:24,199 --> 01:02:26,315
Let me take you out and
show you after the wurl.

806
01:02:27,564 --> 01:02:29,283
So you're here to
make me look pretty.

807
01:02:29,319 --> 01:02:31,002
I'm here to help you
make an impression.

808
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:34,682
Now usually, they dress people in
their close to their district.

809
01:02:34,716 --> 01:02:35,906
Yeah. We're called minors.

810
01:02:35,907 --> 01:02:37,184
Yeah. But I don't want to do that.

811
01:02:38,453 --> 01:02:40,352
I'm gonna do something that
they're gonna remember.

812
01:02:40,958 --> 01:02:42,992
Did they explain about
trying to get sponsors?

813
01:02:43,705 --> 01:02:45,904
Yeah, but I'm not very
good at making friends.

814
01:02:46,261 --> 01:02:47,519
We'll see.

815
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:52,444
How did they change you?

816
01:02:56,082 --> 01:02:57,335
I don't know.

817
01:02:57,419 --> 01:02:59,172
I'm turning to something I'm not.

818
01:03:01,233 --> 01:03:03,947
I just don't wanna be another
piece in their game, you know?

819
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:08,297
You mean you won't kill anyone?

820
01:03:10,357 --> 01:03:11,611
No.

821
01:03:12,267 --> 01:03:13,979
I'm not yet sure I would.

822
01:03:14,218 --> 01:03:16,359
Just like any by off
my time came with.

823
01:03:17,713 --> 01:03:19,333
Yeah, I just keep...

824
01:03:19,334 --> 01:03:20,955
wishing I could think
of a way to show them.

825
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:22,715
That they don't own me.

826
01:03:26,855 --> 01:03:28,666
You know, if I'm gonna die.

827
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:31,164
I wanna still be me.

828
01:03:36,877 --> 01:03:38,162
Does that make any sense?

829
01:03:38,788 --> 01:03:40,036
Yeah.

830
01:03:42,273 --> 01:03:44,179
I just can't afford
to think like that.

831
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:50,109
I miss my sister.

832
01:03:52,574 --> 01:03:53,826
Yeah I know.

833
01:04:08,403 --> 01:04:09,979
Guess, I'll see you tomorrow.

834
01:04:13,869 --> 01:04:15,118
See you tomorrow.

835
01:04:40,488 --> 01:04:43,004
They put all kind of
stuff right in front.

836
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:45,330
Right in the mouth of the Curnocopia.

837
01:04:45,737 --> 01:04:47,730
There'll even be a bow there.

838
01:04:47,766 --> 01:04:48,630
Don't go for it.

839
01:04:48,630 --> 01:04:49,593
Why not?

840
01:04:49,594 --> 01:04:51,676
It's a Bloodbath, they're
trying to pull you in.

841
01:04:51,676 --> 01:04:53,754
It's not your game.

842
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:56,603
You turn, run, find
a high ground.

843
01:04:56,604 --> 01:04:59,348
Look for water.
Water's your new best friend.

844
01:05:00,542 --> 01:05:04,946
Don't step off that pedestal earlier
or they'll blow you sky high.

845
01:05:04,981 --> 01:05:06,232
I won't.

846
01:05:17,624 --> 01:05:19,044
Katniss.

847
01:05:20,109 --> 01:05:21,736
You can do this.

848
01:05:29,365 --> 01:05:30,619
Thanks.

849
01:05:35,012 --> 01:05:36,323
Give me your arm.

850
01:05:41,159 --> 01:05:42,411
Give me your arm.

851
01:05:49,026 --> 01:05:50,145
Give me your arm.

852
01:05:50,146 --> 01:05:51,400
What is that?

853
01:05:53,613 --> 01:05:54,865
Your tracker.

854
01:06:02,771 --> 01:06:04,189
Less than a minute people!

855
01:06:04,856 --> 01:06:05,836
Final checks.

856
01:06:05,837 --> 01:06:08,214
So fifteen up, they are flying.

857
01:06:45,630 --> 01:06:46,882
Here.

858
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:08,554
Thank you.

859
01:07:17,270 --> 01:07:19,178
30 seconds.

860
01:07:25,936 --> 01:07:27,949
I'm not allowed to bet.

861
01:07:28,418 --> 01:07:30,036
But if i could I'd bet on you!

862
01:07:41,849 --> 01:07:44,195
20 seconds.

863
01:07:55,950 --> 01:07:57,950
10 seconds.

864
01:08:23,666 --> 01:08:25,929
Okay, they're in the tubes.

865
01:09:06,068 --> 01:09:07,153
50...

866
01:09:07,154 --> 01:09:08,367
...49...

867
01:09:08,368 --> 01:09:09,507
...48...

868
01:09:09,508 --> 01:09:11,669
...47... 46...

869
01:09:11,751 --> 01:09:13,795
...45... 44...

870
01:09:13,832 --> 01:09:15,878
...43... 42...

871
01:09:15,915 --> 01:09:17,959
...41... 40...

872
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,044
...39... 38...

873
01:09:20,081 --> 01:09:22,134
...37... 36...

874
01:09:22,168 --> 01:09:24,467
...35... 34...

875
01:09:24,504 --> 01:09:26,770
...33... 32...

876
01:09:26,925 --> 01:09:28,973
...31... 30...

877
01:09:29,010 --> 01:09:31,059
...29... 28

878
01:09:31,095 --> 01:09:33,192
...27... 26...

879
01:09:33,228 --> 01:09:35,301
...25... 24...

880
01:09:35,336 --> 01:09:37,377
...23... 22...

881
01:12:47,001 --> 01:12:48,460
And of course...

882
01:12:49,055 --> 01:12:52,108
There's the familiar
boom of the cannon.

883
01:12:52,142 --> 01:12:55,437
Which marks the end of
another fallen Tribute.

884
01:16:27,307 --> 01:16:31,761
Well, that makes 13 gone
in the first eight hours.

885
01:16:31,798 --> 01:16:36,215
And Claudius, I think I
seen alliance forming.

886
01:16:45,343 --> 01:16:47,325
Please don't kill me. Oh no!

887
01:16:50,361 --> 01:16:51,612
Hey, loverboy!

888
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:54,387
You sure she went this way?

889
01:16:54,424 --> 01:16:55,675
Yeah, I'm sure.

890
01:16:56,473 --> 01:16:57,725
You better be.

891
01:16:58,111 --> 01:16:59,801
Yeah. That was a steer
comb back there.

892
01:17:06,582 --> 01:17:08,559
Are you sure we shouldn't
just kill him now?

893
01:17:08,595 --> 01:17:10,535
Nah. He's our best
chance at finding her.

894
01:17:33,057 --> 01:17:34,309
Sir.

895
01:17:36,186 --> 01:17:38,606
She is almost at the edge.

896
01:17:38,815 --> 01:17:40,745
Two kilometers away from
the nearest Tribute.

897
01:17:41,548 --> 01:17:43,008
Let's turn her around.

898
01:18:43,428 --> 01:18:46,098
Killing another on my account... one.

899
01:18:46,135 --> 01:18:47,387
Two.

900
01:18:58,262 --> 01:19:00,557
Uh, she's heading
towards the left flank.

901
01:19:00,593 --> 01:19:01,845
Okay.

902
01:19:03,311 --> 01:19:04,562
Sure.

903
01:19:57,357 --> 01:19:58,776
She's almost there.

904
01:20:12,597 --> 01:20:16,018
Lucia, get a cannon ready.

905
01:20:26,742 --> 01:20:28,547
Oh there she is. There she is.

906
01:21:10,836 --> 01:21:12,099
What you got baby?

907
01:21:41,161 --> 01:21:42,423
Kill here Cato!

908
01:21:47,337 --> 01:21:49,287
I'm coming for you!

909
01:21:54,503 --> 01:21:55,796
I'll do it myself.

910
01:22:04,944 --> 01:22:05,747
Get her!

911
01:22:05,748 --> 01:22:07,000
Come on. Come on.

912
01:22:09,858 --> 01:22:11,809
Maybe you should throw the sword.

913
01:22:12,737 --> 01:22:13,989
Let's just wait her out.

914
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:19,246
She's gonna come down at some points.
That's gonne start her there.

915
01:22:26,089 --> 01:22:27,341
Okay.

916
01:22:28,354 --> 01:22:29,626
Somebody make a fire.

917
01:25:21,725 --> 01:25:22,978
Thank you.

918
01:26:05,538 --> 01:26:06,874
Pssst.

919
01:26:08,292 --> 01:26:09,544
Pssst.

920
01:26:33,255 --> 01:26:36,363
Claudius. I think those are
trackerjackers. Am I wrong?

921
01:26:36,854 --> 01:26:38,105
Oooh.

922
01:26:39,451 --> 01:26:41,297
Those things are very lethal.

923
01:26:41,548 --> 01:26:42,537
Very.

924
01:26:42,539 --> 01:26:44,750
For those of you who don't know.

925
01:26:44,751 --> 01:26:46,961
Trackerjackers are genetically
engineered wasps.

926
01:26:46,998 --> 01:26:49,282
Whose venom causes serious pain.

927
01:26:49,319 --> 01:26:54,692
Powerful hallucinations and
in extreme cases, death.

928
01:29:53,446 --> 01:29:54,698
Run!

929
01:29:55,355 --> 01:29:56,607
Run!

930
01:29:58,151 --> 01:29:59,329
Run!

931
01:29:59,330 --> 01:30:01,040
Damn it. Go!

932
01:30:02,323 --> 01:30:04,764
Katniss, no! What're you doing?

933
01:30:04,801 --> 01:30:06,079
Go!

934
01:30:16,938 --> 01:30:18,492
Hallow isn't lethal.

935
01:30:18,764 --> 01:30:21,611
But the venom of a
trackerjacker sting...

936
01:30:22,227 --> 01:30:25,763
...is enough to doze
off hallucinations.

937
01:31:27,288 --> 01:31:29,218
Please do something.

938
01:31:29,802 --> 01:31:31,534
Katniss, go!

939
01:31:32,817 --> 01:31:37,063
Get out of here!
What're you doing? Go!

940
01:32:36,554 --> 01:32:37,805
Rue?

941
01:32:41,259 --> 01:32:43,418
It's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you.

942
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:02,612
You want mine too?

943
01:33:04,031 --> 01:33:05,283
No, that's okay.

944
01:33:06,691 --> 01:33:07,943
Here.

945
01:33:08,537 --> 01:33:09,789
Thanks.

946
01:33:14,754 --> 01:33:16,183
How long was I asleep?

947
01:33:16,976 --> 01:33:18,603
A couple of days.

948
01:33:19,135 --> 01:33:20,690
I change your leaves twice.

949
01:33:22,797 --> 01:33:24,049
Thank you.

950
01:33:25,604 --> 01:33:27,512
So what happened? When I was out?

951
01:33:28,837 --> 01:33:31,288
The girl from 1 and the boy from 10.

952
01:33:33,302 --> 01:33:34,553
And the uh...

953
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:37,015
And the boy from my district?

954
01:33:38,705 --> 01:33:39,957
No, he's okay.

955
01:33:40,301 --> 01:33:41,855
I think he's down by the river.

956
01:33:45,370 --> 01:33:46,654
Is all about true?

957
01:33:47,301 --> 01:33:48,553
What?

958
01:33:49,033 --> 01:33:50,284
You and him.

959
01:33:51,901 --> 01:33:53,518
So where are Cato and the others?

960
01:33:54,008 --> 01:33:56,115
They got all their
supplies down by the lake.

961
01:33:56,741 --> 01:33:58,786
It's prod up in this
great big pyramid.

962
01:33:59,652 --> 01:34:01,049
That sounds tempting.

963
01:34:17,198 --> 01:34:19,685
Now this green stuff is
gonna smoke like crazy, so

964
01:34:19,686 --> 01:34:22,173
as soon as you light it.
Move on to the next fire.

965
01:34:22,210 --> 01:34:23,649
Light this one last.

966
01:34:23,686 --> 01:34:25,104
And I'll meet you back over here.

967
01:34:25,141 --> 01:34:26,393
Right.

968
01:34:30,415 --> 01:34:32,501
I'll destroy their stuff
while they're chasing us.

969
01:34:32,637 --> 01:34:35,057
We need a signal, in case
one of us gets held up.

970
01:34:35,093 --> 01:34:36,345
Okay. Like what?

971
01:34:38,499 --> 01:34:39,751
Here. Watch this.

972
01:34:45,874 --> 01:34:47,251
Mocking jays.

973
01:34:48,075 --> 01:34:48,877
That's great.

974
01:34:48,878 --> 01:34:50,943
Back home, we used them
to signal all the time..

975
01:34:56,556 --> 01:34:57,808
You try.

976
01:35:07,206 --> 01:35:12,109
Okay so, if we hear that means we're
okay and we'll be back real soon.

977
01:35:12,797 --> 01:35:14,050
We're gonna be okay.

978
01:35:19,902 --> 01:35:21,153
Hey.

979
01:35:21,456 --> 01:35:22,927
I'll see you for supper.

980
01:35:24,398 --> 01:35:26,818
Okay.

981
01:35:54,555 --> 01:35:56,161
Guys, guys look!

982
01:35:56,297 --> 01:35:58,175
Come here. Come on, come on look!

983
01:36:02,619 --> 01:36:03,661
Let's go.

984
01:36:03,662 --> 01:36:05,508
You stay guard over till we get back.

985
01:36:35,426 --> 01:36:38,409
I wanna see if she's gonna
figure out this booby trap.

986
01:36:38,545 --> 01:36:40,945
Yes. It seems they
reburied their mines

987
01:36:40,946 --> 01:36:43,344
around that big pile of goodies.

988
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:58,605
She certainly figure
it out, haven't she?

989
01:40:09,189 --> 01:40:10,451
Katniss!

990
01:40:12,298 --> 01:40:13,716
Katniss!

991
01:40:15,782 --> 01:40:17,409
Katniss help!

992
01:40:18,827 --> 01:40:20,080
Katniss!

993
01:40:24,649 --> 01:40:27,132
Help me! Help!

994
01:40:28,446 --> 01:40:29,698
Katniss!

995
01:40:30,250 --> 01:40:31,554
Katniss!

996
01:40:32,597 --> 01:40:33,849
It's okay.

997
01:40:42,842 --> 01:40:44,093
You're okay.

998
01:40:44,177 --> 01:40:45,146
You're alright.

999
01:40:45,147 --> 01:40:46,816
You're fine.. see?

1000
01:41:15,356 --> 01:41:16,550
It's okay.

1001
01:41:16,551 --> 01:41:17,802
You're okay.

1002
01:41:17,985 --> 01:41:19,237
You're okay.

1003
01:41:19,466 --> 01:41:20,718
You're okay.

1004
01:41:27,750 --> 01:41:29,648
Did you blow up the food?

1005
01:41:32,756 --> 01:41:34,008
Every bit of it.

1006
01:41:37,555 --> 01:41:38,806
Good.

1007
01:41:40,976 --> 01:41:42,906
You have to win.

1008
01:41:57,479 --> 01:41:58,731
Okay.

1009
01:42:06,179 --> 01:42:09,976
Deep in the meadow.

1010
01:42:10,561 --> 01:42:14,201
Under the willow.

1011
01:42:14,931 --> 01:42:18,254
A bed of grass.

1012
01:42:18,290 --> 01:42:22,421
A soft, green pillow.

1013
01:42:23,287 --> 01:42:26,353
Lay down your head.

1014
01:42:26,864 --> 01:42:30,443
And close your eyes.

1015
01:46:25,434 --> 01:46:27,014
Don't kill her.

1016
01:46:27,051 --> 01:46:28,568
You just create a murder.

1017
01:46:28,605 --> 01:46:29,862
It seems I've already got one.

1018
01:46:29,898 --> 01:46:31,944
I heard this rumors
out on District 11.

1019
01:46:31,980 --> 01:46:33,383
This could get away from here.

1020
01:46:33,425 --> 01:46:34,781
What do you want?

1021
01:46:35,292 --> 01:46:37,624
There are a lot of
anger out there.

1022
01:46:37,625 --> 01:46:39,955
I know you know how to handle
a mod, you've done it before.

1023
01:46:40,070 --> 01:46:45,337
If you can't scare them.
Give them something to root for.

1024
01:46:46,245 --> 01:46:47,497
Such as?

1025
01:46:49,864 --> 01:46:51,116
Young love.

1026
01:46:53,047 --> 01:46:54,898
So you were like an underdog.

1027
01:46:54,935 --> 01:46:56,750
Everyone likes an underdog.

1028
01:46:56,786 --> 01:46:58,038
I don't.

1029
01:46:59,525 --> 01:47:00,933
How many are dead?

1030
01:47:01,287 --> 01:47:02,863
10? 11? 12?

1031
01:47:03,301 --> 01:47:04,176
Uh...

1032
01:47:04,177 --> 01:47:05,637
Not personally, no!

1033
01:47:06,263 --> 01:47:07,515
I have.

1034
01:47:08,787 --> 01:47:10,342
Lots of underdogs.

1035
01:47:10,874 --> 01:47:12,324
Not too cold too.

1036
01:47:12,835 --> 01:47:14,661
Row crops. Minerals.

1037
01:47:15,454 --> 01:47:16,810
Things we need.

1038
01:47:17,926 --> 01:47:20,096
There are lots of underdogs.

1039
01:47:21,233 --> 01:47:23,715
And I think if you could see them.

1040
01:47:24,581 --> 01:47:26,980
You would not root for them either.

1041
01:47:29,588 --> 01:47:31,007
Unlike you..

1042
01:47:34,209 --> 01:47:35,492
Be careful.

1043
01:47:46,581 --> 01:47:48,892
Attention Tributes. Attention!

1044
01:47:48,928 --> 01:47:53,763
The regulations required a single
victor has been... suspended!

1045
01:47:53,799 --> 01:47:57,826
From now on, two victors maybe
crowned if both originate

1046
01:47:57,827 --> 01:48:01,853
from the same district.
This will be the only announcement.

1047
01:49:05,809 --> 01:49:07,384
Oh my God! Peeta!

1048
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:09,011
Peeta!

1049
01:49:11,807 --> 01:49:13,059
Hi.

1050
01:49:16,209 --> 01:49:17,461
It's okay.

1051
01:49:32,973 --> 01:49:34,224
What was it?

1052
01:49:34,756 --> 01:49:36,008
The sword.

1053
01:49:37,489 --> 01:49:38,741
It's badly hurt.

1054
01:49:40,400 --> 01:49:41,651
It's gonna be fine.

1055
01:49:54,785 --> 01:49:56,037
Katniss...

1056
01:49:59,458 --> 01:50:00,286
Katniss...

1057
01:50:00,287 --> 01:50:01,539
No!

1058
01:50:02,567 --> 01:50:03,850
I'm not gonna leave you!

1059
01:50:04,674 --> 01:50:06,186
I'm not gonna do that.

1060
01:50:13,979 --> 01:50:15,231
Why not?

1061
01:50:35,353 --> 01:50:37,909
Nobody's gonna find you in here.

1062
01:50:38,149 --> 01:50:39,547
They already found me.

1063
01:50:43,730 --> 01:50:45,951
We just get you some medicine.

1064
01:50:46,170 --> 01:50:48,121
He can't.
They don't give so much parachutes.

1065
01:50:49,185 --> 01:50:50,437
We'll figure something out.

1066
01:50:51,459 --> 01:50:52,711
Like what?

1067
01:50:53,630 --> 01:50:54,881
Something.

1068
01:51:56,208 --> 01:51:57,491
Is that medicine?

1069
01:51:57,543 --> 01:51:58,471
No!

1070
01:51:58,472 --> 01:51:59,724
Soup.

1071
01:52:11,334 --> 01:52:12,867
Nice taste.

1072
01:52:14,932 --> 01:52:16,977
Do you fed - once?

1073
01:52:19,887 --> 01:52:21,641
I think about that all the time.

1074
01:52:23,769 --> 01:52:25,333
How I tossed you that bread.

1075
01:52:25,636 --> 01:52:26,396
Peeta.

1076
01:52:26,397 --> 01:52:28,285
I should've gone to you.

1077
01:52:28,286 --> 01:52:30,173
I should've just gone
out to the rain.

1078
01:52:32,927 --> 01:52:34,502
You feel hot.

1079
01:52:36,839 --> 01:52:38,883
I remember the first time I saw you.

1080
01:52:40,302 --> 01:52:42,837
Your hair was in two
braids instead of one.

1081
01:52:43,766 --> 01:52:45,049
I remember when you...

1082
01:52:45,404 --> 01:52:48,189
You sang in music as
simply the teacher said.

1083
01:52:48,209 --> 01:52:51,339
Who knows the pie song in
your head shut straight up!

1084
01:52:53,008 --> 01:52:54,541
After that...

1085
01:52:55,031 --> 01:52:57,003
I watched you going home everyday.

1086
01:52:59,673 --> 01:53:00,925
Everyday.

1087
01:53:08,979 --> 01:53:10,262
Well, say something.

1088
01:53:13,683 --> 01:53:15,310
I'm not gonna say something.

1089
01:53:18,106 --> 01:53:19,358
You can come here.

1090
01:53:21,287 --> 01:53:22,539
Please.

1091
01:53:34,473 --> 01:53:36,612
If I don't even make it.

1092
01:53:44,831 --> 01:53:47,293
Attention Tributes. Attention!

1093
01:53:47,330 --> 01:53:49,125
Commencing Insuberance.

1094
01:53:49,161 --> 01:53:52,155
There will be a feast
tomorrow at the Curnocopia.

1095
01:53:52,468 --> 01:53:55,159
This will be no ordinary occasion.

1096
01:53:55,196 --> 01:53:57,339
Each of you needs something.

1097
01:53:57,376 --> 01:53:58,873
Desperately.

1098
01:53:59,248 --> 01:54:01,376
And we planned to be...

1099
01:54:01,866 --> 01:54:03,181
...generous hosts.

1100
01:54:03,420 --> 01:54:04,672
You rather sit.

1101
01:54:06,153 --> 01:54:08,224
That we needed and you can't walk.

1102
01:54:08,261 --> 01:54:09,649
Promise me, you'll not gonna
risk your life for me.

1103
01:54:09,650 --> 01:54:11,036
I'm not gonna let you.

1104
01:54:11,245 --> 01:54:12,497
You would do it for me.

1105
01:54:13,331 --> 01:54:14,583
Wouldn't you?

1106
01:54:16,147 --> 01:54:17,462
Why are you doing this?

1107
01:54:38,648 --> 01:54:39,742
Peeta!

1108
01:54:39,743 --> 01:54:40,995
Please.

1109
01:54:41,736 --> 01:54:42,988
Stay.

1110
01:54:48,026 --> 01:54:49,277
Okay.

1111
01:54:50,331 --> 01:54:51,802
I'll stay.

1112
01:56:46,727 --> 01:56:47,979
No!

1113
01:56:53,486 --> 01:56:55,082
Where's lover boy?

1114
01:56:58,232 --> 01:57:00,219
Oh I see.

1115
01:57:00,256 --> 01:57:02,019
You're gonna help him right?

1116
01:57:02,676 --> 01:57:03,928
That's sweet.

1117
01:57:04,105 --> 01:57:07,413
Now, it's too bad you couldn't
help your little friend.

1118
01:57:07,809 --> 01:57:10,698
That little girl...
what was her name again?

1119
01:57:11,189 --> 01:57:12,440
Rue?

1120
01:57:14,495 --> 01:57:16,717
Yeah. Well we killed her.

1121
01:57:17,500 --> 01:57:18,960
And now...

1122
01:57:19,429 --> 01:57:21,140
We're gonna kill you...

1123
01:57:26,690 --> 01:57:27,942
You kill her?

1124
01:57:27,979 --> 01:57:29,194
No!

1125
01:57:29,402 --> 01:57:31,431
Cato!

1126
01:57:31,468 --> 01:57:32,719
Shout her name!

1127
01:57:42,869 --> 01:57:44,663
Just this time twelve.

1128
01:57:45,508 --> 01:57:46,760
For Rue!

1129
01:58:02,459 --> 01:58:03,847
Peeta!

1130
01:58:03,883 --> 01:58:05,198
I got it.

1131
01:58:05,234 --> 01:58:06,663
I got the medicine.

1132
01:58:06,700 --> 01:58:08,056
What happened to you?

1133
01:58:08,092 --> 01:58:09,803
No, I'm not. What happened?

1134
01:58:09,919 --> 01:58:11,989
The girl from two, she threw a knife.
I'm okay.

1135
01:58:12,026 --> 01:58:13,945
You shouldn't have gone.
You said you aren't gonna go.

1136
01:58:13,982 --> 01:58:15,233
You got worse.

1137
01:58:22,175 --> 01:58:24,115
You get some of that too.

1138
01:58:24,152 --> 01:58:25,404
I'm okay.

1139
01:58:28,288 --> 01:58:29,539
That feels better.

1140
01:58:31,511 --> 01:58:32,648
Okay.

1141
01:58:32,649 --> 01:58:33,901
Are you?

1142
01:58:34,161 --> 01:58:34,911
I'm okay.

1143
01:58:34,912 --> 01:58:36,237
No, come on. You need it too.

1144
01:58:36,999 --> 01:58:38,250
Come on.

1145
01:59:41,434 --> 01:59:42,686
Oh.

1146
01:59:43,009 --> 01:59:44,261
You're so much better.

1147
01:59:46,942 --> 01:59:48,475
Oh my God, Peeta.

1148
01:59:49,477 --> 01:59:51,323
I couldn't feel anything.

1149
01:59:52,585 --> 01:59:53,837
We could go home.

1150
01:59:55,078 --> 01:59:56,831
We could. With all the team left.

1151
01:59:58,322 --> 01:59:59,575
We could go home.

1152
02:00:04,342 --> 02:00:06,136
We know - took off.

1153
02:00:06,313 --> 02:00:08,228
Cate's gonna be by
the Curnocopia.

1154
02:00:08,229 --> 02:00:10,142
He's not gonna go to
places he doesn't know.

1155
02:00:10,340 --> 02:00:12,228
Fox face, she could be anywhere.

1156
02:00:15,378 --> 02:00:18,445
We should probably hunt around here.
We don't have any food left.

1157
02:00:18,622 --> 02:00:20,531
Okay, uh, I'll take the bow.

1158
02:00:22,618 --> 02:00:23,870
I'm just kidding.

1159
02:00:43,189 --> 02:00:44,441
Peeta?

1160
02:00:48,613 --> 02:00:49,865
Peeta?

1161
02:00:53,047 --> 02:00:54,298
Peeta?

1162
02:00:55,268 --> 02:00:56,488
Peeta?

1163
02:00:56,489 --> 02:00:57,562
Are you okay?

1164
02:00:57,563 --> 02:00:59,045
I hear the cannon.

1165
02:00:59,493 --> 02:01:01,230
That's nightlock Peeta!

1166
02:01:01,266 --> 02:01:02,873
You will be dead in a minute.

1167
02:01:02,909 --> 02:01:04,136
I... I didn't know.

1168
02:01:04,137 --> 02:01:05,390
You scare me to death.

1169
02:01:05,607 --> 02:01:06,858
Damn you.

1170
02:01:06,895 --> 02:01:08,147
I'm sorry.

1171
02:01:10,175 --> 02:01:11,427
I'm sorry.

1172
02:01:19,397 --> 02:01:21,399
I don't even knew, she
was following me.

1173
02:01:21,910 --> 02:01:23,162
She's clever.

1174
02:01:23,611 --> 02:01:24,862
Too clever.

1175
02:01:26,302 --> 02:01:27,481
What're you doing?

1176
02:01:27,482 --> 02:01:29,255
Maybe Cato likes berries too?

1177
02:01:35,190 --> 02:01:36,442
What time is it?

1178
02:01:36,838 --> 02:01:38,288
A little afternoon.

1179
02:01:38,325 --> 02:01:39,702
Why is it so dark?

1180
02:01:39,738 --> 02:01:41,824
Must be in a hurry to end it.

1181
02:01:44,693 --> 02:01:45,578
Ready Lusia?

1182
02:01:45,580 --> 02:01:46,915
Oh right here sir!

1183
02:01:48,679 --> 02:01:49,930
That's great.

1184
02:01:50,744 --> 02:01:52,048
Can you put that in the middle?

1185
02:01:52,084 --> 02:01:53,336
Sure.

1186
02:02:01,530 --> 02:02:02,781
That's it.

1187
02:02:04,023 --> 02:02:05,619
That's it. Excellent.

1188
02:02:15,884 --> 02:02:17,772
Did you hear that?

1189
02:02:50,871 --> 02:02:52,122
What was that?

1190
02:02:52,999 --> 02:02:54,293
It's the finale.

1191
02:03:10,242 --> 02:03:11,494
Let's go.

1192
02:05:04,853 --> 02:05:06,106
Here.

1193
02:06:18,761 --> 02:06:20,013
Go on.

1194
02:06:20,868 --> 02:06:22,120
Shoot.

1195
02:06:23,914 --> 02:06:25,646
And we both go down and you'd win.

1196
02:06:29,557 --> 02:06:30,809
Go on.

1197
02:06:32,509 --> 02:06:34,242
Dead anyway.

1198
02:06:38,884 --> 02:06:40,198
I always want a drink.

1199
02:06:43,088 --> 02:06:44,590
Until not so now.

1200
02:06:48,501 --> 02:06:50,191
How's that? Is that what you want?

1201
02:06:50,228 --> 02:06:51,479
Huh!

1202
02:06:52,987 --> 02:06:54,238
No!

1203
02:06:56,305 --> 02:06:58,015
I can still do this.

1204
02:06:59,497 --> 02:07:01,416
I can still do it.

1205
02:07:02,344 --> 02:07:03,700
One more kill.

1206
02:07:06,277 --> 02:07:07,915
It's the only thing I know how to do.

1207
02:07:09,145 --> 02:07:11,670
Bring pride to the district.

1208
02:07:15,227 --> 02:07:16,479
Not that it matters.

1209
02:07:44,196 --> 02:07:45,448
Please...!

1210
02:08:32,880 --> 02:08:35,300
Attention. Attention Tributes.

1211
02:08:35,487 --> 02:08:38,794
There has been a slight rule change.

1212
02:08:39,013 --> 02:08:43,165
The previous provision
allowing for two victors

1213
02:08:43,166 --> 02:08:47,317
from the same district
has been revoked.

1214
02:08:47,354 --> 02:08:51,917
Only one victor maybe crowned.
Goodluck.

1215
02:08:52,835 --> 02:08:55,965
And may the odds be
ever in your favor.

1216
02:09:10,673 --> 02:09:11,925
Go ahead.

1217
02:09:15,805 --> 02:09:17,151
One of us should go home!

1218
02:09:18,664 --> 02:09:20,771
One of us has to die.
They had to have their victor.

1219
02:09:22,951 --> 02:09:24,202
No.

1220
02:09:25,058 --> 02:09:26,310
They don't.

1221
02:09:28,282 --> 02:09:29,534
Why should they?

1222
02:09:30,723 --> 02:09:31,556
No!

1223
02:09:31,557 --> 02:09:32,600
Trust me.

1224
02:09:33,237 --> 02:09:34,488
Trust me.

1225
02:09:53,537 --> 02:09:54,788
Together?

1226
02:09:56,405 --> 02:09:57,657
Together.

1227
02:09:58,898 --> 02:10:00,150
Okay.

1228
02:10:01,005 --> 02:10:02,257
One...

1229
02:10:04,562 --> 02:10:05,814
Two...

1230
02:10:11,886 --> 02:10:13,138
Three...

1231
02:10:14,838 --> 02:10:16,090
Stop!

1232
02:10:16,861 --> 02:10:18,113
Stop!

1233
02:10:21,482 --> 02:10:22,734
Ladies and gentlemen.

1234
02:10:23,704 --> 02:10:25,415
May I present the winners...

1235
02:10:25,947 --> 02:10:28,899
.. of the 74th Annual Hunger Games.

1236
02:10:55,584 --> 02:10:57,513
They're not happy with you.

1237
02:10:58,317 --> 02:10:59,819
Why? Because we didn't die?

1238
02:11:01,175 --> 02:11:02,426
Because you showed them all.

1239
02:11:03,428 --> 02:11:04,491
Well..

1240
02:11:04,492 --> 02:11:06,187
I'm sorry it didn't go
the way they planned.

1241
02:11:06,188 --> 02:11:07,882
You know I'm not very
happy with them either.

1242
02:11:07,918 --> 02:11:09,170
Katniss...

1243
02:11:09,311 --> 02:11:10,563
This is serious.

1244
02:11:11,147 --> 02:11:12,539
Not just for you.

1245
02:11:12,576 --> 02:11:14,245
They don't take this things lightly.

1246
02:12:07,624 --> 02:12:11,118
You say you couldn't help yourself.
You're so in love

1247
02:12:11,119 --> 02:12:14,612
with this boy that the dark
have not with the most...

1248
02:12:14,649 --> 02:12:16,339
Unthinkable...

1249
02:12:16,375 --> 02:12:20,475
You rather die... than not
be with him you understand?

1250
02:12:20,511 --> 02:12:21,763
How did you feel?

1251
02:12:22,259 --> 02:12:25,347
When you found him by the river?

1252
02:12:29,634 --> 02:12:32,138
I felt like the happiest
person in the world.

1253
02:12:36,300 --> 02:12:38,208
I couldn't imagine life without him.

1254
02:12:44,802 --> 02:12:47,378
And what about you Peeta?

1255
02:12:47,889 --> 02:12:49,663
Damn, she just saved my life.

1256
02:12:49,699 --> 02:12:51,040
We saved each other.

1257
02:12:52,573 --> 02:12:53,825
Ladies and gentlemen.

1258
02:12:54,419 --> 02:12:58,753
The star cross lovers
of District 12, this

1259
02:12:58,754 --> 02:13:03,088
years victors of the 74th
Annual Hunger Games.

1260
02:13:19,570 --> 02:13:20,821
Congratulations.

1261
02:13:21,166 --> 02:13:22,417
Thank you.

1262
02:13:28,030 --> 02:13:29,386
What a lovely pin.

1263
02:13:29,783 --> 02:13:31,692
Thank you, it's from my district.

1264
02:13:33,068 --> 02:13:35,249
They must be very proud of you.

1265
02:13:47,974 --> 02:13:49,581
So what happens when we get back?

1266
02:13:51,751 --> 02:13:53,003
I don't know.

1267
02:13:54,192 --> 02:13:56,080
I guess I may try to forget.

1268
02:14:00,597 --> 02:14:02,412
I don't wanna forget.
