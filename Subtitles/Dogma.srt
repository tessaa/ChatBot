1
00:02:06,143 --> 00:02:09,253
Ladies and gentlemen, the driving
force behind Catholicism Wow!...

2
00:02:09,394 --> 00:02:11,129
...Cardinal Glick.

3
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:19,405
Thank you, thank you.

4
00:02:19,522 --> 00:02:21,533
Now, we all know
how the majority...

5
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,429
...and the media in this country...

6
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,729
...view the Catholic Church.

7
00:02:25,899 --> 00:02:29,019
They think of us as a passÃ©,
archaic institution.

8
00:02:29,369 --> 00:02:32,279
People find the Bible obtuse...

9
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:33,859
...even hokey.

10
00:02:34,141 --> 00:02:36,029
Now, in an effort
to disprove all that...

11
00:02:36,316 --> 00:02:39,779
...the Church has appointed this year
as a time of renewal...

12
00:02:39,949 --> 00:02:42,444
...both of faith and of style.

13
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:44,959
For example, the crucifix.

14
00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:47,749
While it has been a time-honored
symbol of our faith...

15
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:50,799
...Holy Mother Church
has decided to retire...

16
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,459
...this highly recognizable...

17
00:02:52,629 --> 00:02:54,919
...yet wholly depressing image...

18
00:02:55,089 --> 00:02:57,139
...of our Lord, crucified.

19
00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:00,559
Christ didn't come to Earth
to give us the willies.

20
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:02,469
He came to help us out.

21
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:06,269
He was a booster, and it's
with that take on our Lord in mind...

22
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:09,149
...that we've come up with a new,
more inspiring sigil.

23
00:03:09,979 --> 00:03:13,149
So it is with great pleasure
that I present you with the first...

24
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,819
...of many revamps
the Catholicism Wow! campaign...

25
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:19,409
...will unveil over the next year,
I give you...

26
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:20,699
..."The Buddy Christ."

27
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:33,339
That's not the sanctioned term
we're using for the symbol.

28
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:35,919
Just something we've been
kicking around the office.

29
00:03:36,089 --> 00:03:37,469
But look at it.

30
00:03:37,629 --> 00:03:39,429
Doesn't it pop?

31
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,138
Buddy Christ.

32
00:03:41,308 --> 00:03:43,258
Well, there you have it.

33
00:03:43,358 --> 00:03:45,148
Let me get this straight.

34
00:03:45,318 --> 00:03:48,448
You don't believe in God
because of Alice in Wonderland?

35
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,948
No, Through the Looking Glass.

36
00:03:51,318 --> 00:03:53,118
That poem,
"The Walrus and the Carpenter"...

37
00:03:53,278 --> 00:03:55,198
...is an indictment
of organized religion.

38
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,448
The Walrus, with his girth
and good nature...

39
00:03:57,618 --> 00:03:59,578
...he obviously represents
either Buddha...

40
00:03:59,748 --> 00:04:02,538
...or with his tusks, the Hindu
elephant god, Lord Ganesha.

41
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:04,628
That takes care
of your Eastern religions.

42
00:04:04,798 --> 00:04:07,468
Now, the Carpenter,
an obvious reference to Jesus Christ...

43
00:04:07,628 --> 00:04:10,718
...who was raised a carpenter's son,
represents Western religions.

44
00:04:12,048 --> 00:04:13,638
Now, in the poem,
what do they do?

45
00:04:13,808 --> 00:04:16,308
They dupe all these oysters
into following them...

46
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:20,148
...then proceed to shuck and devour
the helpless creatures en masse.

47
00:04:20,308 --> 00:04:23,148
I don't know what that says to you,
but to me it says...

48
00:04:23,318 --> 00:04:26,988
...that following these faiths
based on mythological figures...

49
00:04:27,148 --> 00:04:28,778
...destroys one's inner being.

50
00:04:30,108 --> 00:04:31,988
Organized religion destroys
who we are...

51
00:04:32,158 --> 00:04:34,988
...by inhibiting our actions,
by inhibiting our decisions...

52
00:04:35,158 --> 00:04:38,288
...out of fear of some
intangible parent figure...

53
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:41,328
...who shakes a finger at us
from thousands of years ago...

54
00:04:41,498 --> 00:04:45,338
...and says, "Do it...
Do it and I'll fucking spank you!"

55
00:04:45,498 --> 00:04:46,758
Oh, Jesus!

56
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:50,468
The way you put it, I've never really
thought about it like that before.

57
00:04:51,388 --> 00:04:53,848
What have I been doing
with my life?

58
00:04:54,848 --> 00:04:57,348
- What am I...?
- Yeah, I know.

59
00:04:57,518 --> 00:04:59,178
Listen, my advice to you...

60
00:04:59,348 --> 00:05:01,978
...take this money you've
collected for your parish...

61
00:05:02,148 --> 00:05:05,108
...go get yourself a nice dress,
you know? Fix yourself up.

62
00:05:05,268 --> 00:05:08,488
Find some man, some woman, you
can connect with, even for a moment...

63
00:05:08,648 --> 00:05:12,408
...because that's really all life is,
Sister, it's a series of moments.

64
00:05:12,568 --> 00:05:14,698
Why don't you seize yours?

65
00:05:17,907 --> 00:05:20,537
Attagirl. Attagirl.

66
00:05:27,207 --> 00:05:29,217
You know, here's what
I don't get about you.

67
00:05:29,377 --> 00:05:32,087
You know for a fact
that there is a God.

68
00:05:32,257 --> 00:05:34,967
You've been in his presence.
He's spoken to you personally.

69
00:05:35,137 --> 00:05:38,387
- Yet I heard you claim to be atheist.
- I like to fuck with the clergy.

70
00:05:38,557 --> 00:05:41,807
I just love it. I love to keep
those guys on their toes.

71
00:05:41,977 --> 00:05:43,647
Here's what I don't get about you.

72
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:46,647
Why do you feel the need
to come to this place all the time?

73
00:05:46,817 --> 00:05:49,237
My friend, because
this is humanity at its best.

74
00:05:49,397 --> 00:05:50,437
Look at them.

75
00:05:50,607 --> 00:05:54,407
All that anger, all that mistrust,
all that unhappiness...

76
00:05:54,567 --> 00:05:58,407
...forgotten for that one perfect moment
when they get off the plane.

77
00:05:58,577 --> 00:05:59,747
See those two?

78
00:05:59,907 --> 00:06:03,167
That guy doesn't know that the girl
cheated on him while she was away.

79
00:06:03,327 --> 00:06:05,077
- She did?
- Twice.

80
00:06:05,247 --> 00:06:07,337
- Nice.
- But it doesn't matter right now...

81
00:06:07,497 --> 00:06:10,757
...because they're just both so relieved
to be with one another.

82
00:06:11,467 --> 00:06:12,717
I like that.

83
00:06:12,877 --> 00:06:15,087
I wish they could all
feel that way more often.

84
00:06:15,257 --> 00:06:18,257
Is this why I had to come down here
and miss my fucking cartoons?

85
00:06:18,427 --> 00:06:20,847
You call me, you tell me
it's important, you know?

86
00:06:21,017 --> 00:06:24,137
What, to share in your half-assed
obsession with Hallmark moments?

87
00:06:24,307 --> 00:06:26,437
We're going home.

88
00:06:26,607 --> 00:06:28,857
Somebody sent us this in the mail.

89
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:36,777
Take it and quit leering at me.
People will think I broke up with you.

90
00:06:36,947 --> 00:06:40,247
- You did just say we're going home?
- Read.

91
00:06:40,407 --> 00:06:44,287
"Cardinal Glick Cuts Ribbon On
Catholicism Wow! Campaign."

92
00:06:44,457 --> 00:06:45,917
And?

93
00:06:46,957 --> 00:06:49,627
You have to keep reading.

94
00:06:49,796 --> 00:06:51,876
"The rededication of
St. Michael's Church"...

95
00:06:52,046 --> 00:06:53,626
...is the kickoff of
a new campaign...

96
00:06:53,796 --> 00:06:56,216
...which seeks to bring
Catholicism into the mainstream.

97
00:06:56,386 --> 00:06:58,636
With a papal sanction,
the archway entrance...

98
00:06:58,806 --> 00:07:01,306
...of the century-old Jersey Shore
house of worship...

99
00:07:01,476 --> 00:07:03,806
...will serve as a passageway
of plenary indulgence...

100
00:07:03,976 --> 00:07:07,306
...a little-known Catholic belief
offering all that passes through it...

101
00:07:07,476 --> 00:07:09,146
...a morally clean slate.

102
00:07:09,316 --> 00:07:12,396
For Sunday News Brief,
I'm Grant Hicks.

103
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:16,026
All I gotta do, I walk through the arch
thing, and then I can go back home?

104
00:07:16,196 --> 00:07:19,486
No. By walking through the archway,
all your sins are forgiven.

105
00:07:19,656 --> 00:07:22,246
- Then all we have to do is die.
- Die? I don't wanna die.

106
00:07:22,406 --> 00:07:26,036
- You rather hang around here?
- No. We don't know if we can die.

107
00:07:26,206 --> 00:07:29,206
But what if we can and then
the arch thing doesn't work?

108
00:07:29,376 --> 00:07:30,956
What then, hell? Fuck that.

109
00:07:31,126 --> 00:07:33,086
It's impossible.
If we cut off our wings...

110
00:07:33,256 --> 00:07:36,586
...and transubstantiate to complete
human form, we become mortal.

111
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:39,136
If we die with clean souls,
they can't keep us out.

112
00:07:39,306 --> 00:07:42,346
We won't be angels anymore,
but at least we get to go home.

113
00:07:42,516 --> 00:07:45,726
- Who sent the paper?
- Who cares who sent the paper?

114
00:07:45,896 --> 00:07:49,016
All that matters is that after
all these years, we found a loophole.

115
00:07:49,186 --> 00:07:50,686
He can't keep us out anymore.

116
00:07:50,856 --> 00:07:53,106
Once we're back in,
he'll just forgive and forget.

117
00:07:53,276 --> 00:07:57,066
But this thing, this is Church law.
It's not divine mandate.

118
00:07:57,236 --> 00:08:00,736
Church laws are fallible
because they're created by man.

119
00:08:00,906 --> 00:08:04,246
One of the last sacred promises
imparted to Peter, the first pope...

120
00:08:04,406 --> 00:08:07,876
...by the son of God
before he left was:

121
00:08:08,036 --> 00:08:09,706
"Whatever you hold true on Earth..."

122
00:08:09,876 --> 00:08:11,166
"I'll hold true in heaven."

123
00:08:11,336 --> 00:08:14,216
It's dogmatic law. If the Church
says it's so, God must adhere.

124
00:08:14,376 --> 00:08:16,006
This thing has a papal sanction...

125
00:08:16,176 --> 00:08:19,046
Let it never be said your
anal retentive attention to detail...

126
00:08:19,216 --> 00:08:20,846
...never yielded positive results.

127
00:08:21,006 --> 00:08:23,516
You can't be anal retentive
if you don't have an anus.

128
00:08:23,676 --> 00:08:25,555
Outstanding work!

129
00:08:25,725 --> 00:08:28,475
There's just one thing
I think we gotta do before we leave.

130
00:08:28,645 --> 00:08:30,645
This will help us get back
on his good side.

131
00:08:30,815 --> 00:08:31,895
What?

132
00:08:32,065 --> 00:08:34,855
I've been dreaming about this
for five years. Read that.

133
00:08:35,025 --> 00:08:36,395
"Mooby, the Golden Calf.

134
00:08:36,565 --> 00:08:39,235
Creating an empire
out of simplicity."

135
00:08:39,405 --> 00:08:41,195
I wanna hit them.

136
00:08:41,365 --> 00:08:43,785
You really are
Just a simple creature.

137
00:08:43,945 --> 00:08:46,325
We find a way back
and you wanna jeopardize that...

138
00:08:46,495 --> 00:08:48,535
...because you yearn
for the good old days.

139
00:08:48,705 --> 00:08:52,085
What better way to repent than by
resuming the position I once denied...

140
00:08:52,245 --> 00:08:53,625
...thanks to you?

141
00:08:53,795 --> 00:08:56,795
I don't think a killing spree
is gonna make things better for us.

142
00:08:56,965 --> 00:08:59,585
Killing spree?
I'm talking about divine justice here.

143
00:08:59,755 --> 00:09:03,135
I'm talking about raining down fire
and brimstone, punishing the wicked.

144
00:09:03,305 --> 00:09:05,845
He's all about that.
I know he'd want this done.

145
00:09:06,015 --> 00:09:08,515
There hasn't been an Angel of Death
since you quit.

146
00:09:08,685 --> 00:09:10,265
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

147
00:09:10,435 --> 00:09:13,225
And besides, what if you're wrong,
like you always are?

148
00:09:13,395 --> 00:09:15,935
If I'm wrong, which I'm not,
it's not gonna matter.

149
00:09:16,105 --> 00:09:18,275
We're gonna pass through
your arch thing anyway.

150
00:09:18,445 --> 00:09:21,235
We're gonna be forgiven.
No harm, no foul.

151
00:09:21,405 --> 00:09:24,945
Well, he does hate competition.
I will say that.

152
00:09:25,115 --> 00:09:27,285
And your Mooby certainly falls
under that heading.

153
00:09:27,455 --> 00:09:29,415
Where is this church
we have to go to?

154
00:09:29,575 --> 00:09:32,785
New Jersey. Rededication ceremony
is in four days.

155
00:09:32,955 --> 00:09:34,795
Last four days on Earth?

156
00:09:34,955 --> 00:09:37,165
If I had a dick, I'd go get laid.

157
00:09:37,335 --> 00:09:39,465
- We can do the next best thing.
- What's that?

158
00:09:39,635 --> 00:09:41,385
Let's kill people.

159
00:09:41,545 --> 00:09:43,135
Oh, not you.

160
00:09:50,145 --> 00:09:52,685
The Illinois Chapter
of the Right to Life Foundation...

161
00:09:54,065 --> 00:09:56,275
...will be holding its
biannual softball game...

162
00:09:56,435 --> 00:09:59,944
...against the Cook County
Pro-Choice League next Sunday at 2.

163
00:10:00,104 --> 00:10:02,364
Today's second collection
will be donated...

164
00:10:02,524 --> 00:10:05,284
...to the John Doe Jersey Life Fund.

165
00:10:05,444 --> 00:10:07,744
For those of you
who haven't followed the news...

166
00:10:07,904 --> 00:10:10,744
...an unidentified homeless man
who was accosted...

167
00:10:10,914 --> 00:10:14,084
...and severely beaten at
the New Jersey Shore last Tuesday...

168
00:10:14,244 --> 00:10:18,334
...lies in critical but stable condition
in one of that area's hospitals.

169
00:10:18,504 --> 00:10:20,174
He lacks identification...

170
00:10:20,334 --> 00:10:23,754
...and police have had no luck
tracking down any possible family.

171
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:28,174
The archbishop of the Trenton diocese
has disputed the state's decision...

172
00:10:28,344 --> 00:10:31,514
...to remove the indigent man
from life-support systems...

173
00:10:31,684 --> 00:10:33,894
...asking that Catholics
all over the country...

174
00:10:35,274 --> 00:10:37,524
...join in this protest
against euthanasia.

175
00:10:38,774 --> 00:10:41,024
Well, now please rise
for the recession of faith.

176
00:10:45,034 --> 00:10:47,534
We believe in one god,
the Father Almighty...

177
00:10:47,694 --> 00:10:49,204
...maker of heaven and earth.

178
00:10:49,364 --> 00:10:52,374
We believe in Jesus Christ,
his only son, our Lord...

179
00:10:53,994 --> 00:10:55,244
Hey, choose life!

180
00:10:55,414 --> 00:10:58,794
You're gonna burn in hell,
you fucking baby killer!

181
00:10:58,964 --> 00:11:00,874
Holy shit, it's the pope.

182
00:11:01,044 --> 00:11:02,134
Where?

183
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:03,544
What are you talking about?

184
00:11:12,894 --> 00:11:16,514
Jesus. You're a Catholic.
Can't you talk to them?

185
00:11:16,684 --> 00:11:18,684
They hate me more than you,
no doubt.

186
00:11:18,854 --> 00:11:21,644
You have an excuse. You're Jewish.
You don't know any better.

187
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:25,194
We already used that excuse
when we killed Christ.

188
00:11:25,364 --> 00:11:27,404
Where were you yesterday?
We went to brunch.

189
00:11:27,574 --> 00:11:28,864
I went to church.

190
00:11:29,034 --> 00:11:30,784
That still kills me, you and church.

191
00:11:30,954 --> 00:11:34,413
If only they knew your tithing came
from a Planned Parenthood check.

192
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:37,123
I don't know why I still go, Liz.

193
00:11:38,253 --> 00:11:41,793
I can remember going to church
when I was young and being moved.

194
00:11:41,963 --> 00:11:45,173
Now I sit there every Sunday
and I feel nothing.

195
00:11:45,343 --> 00:11:47,673
I don't think I have any faith left.

196
00:11:48,923 --> 00:11:51,883
Remember that seminary student
I tried to set you up with?

197
00:11:53,433 --> 00:11:57,353
The 20-year-old. The one I could
have babysat for in high school.

198
00:11:57,523 --> 00:11:59,733
Well, the point is,
he told me something.

199
00:11:59,893 --> 00:12:02,353
He said that faith
is like a glass of water.

200
00:12:02,523 --> 00:12:05,443
When you're young, the glass is little,
so it's easy to fill.

201
00:12:05,613 --> 00:12:07,443
As you get older,
the glass gets bigger.

202
00:12:07,613 --> 00:12:09,533
The same amount of liquid
doesn't fill it.

203
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:12,453
But periodically
the glass has to be refilled.

204
00:12:12,613 --> 00:12:14,413
You're suggesting I need
to get filled?

205
00:12:14,573 --> 00:12:15,703
In more ways than one.

206
00:12:15,873 --> 00:12:17,583
You need to get laid,
Bethany Sloane.

207
00:12:17,743 --> 00:12:20,203
You need a man,
if only for 10 minutes.

208
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:23,083
My experience is that
the average male is never a man...

209
00:12:23,253 --> 00:12:25,583
...not even for 10 minutes
in his entire life span.

210
00:12:25,753 --> 00:12:28,593
That sounds militant.
You thinking of joining the other side?

211
00:12:28,763 --> 00:12:30,593
Couldn't do it.
Women are insane.

212
00:12:30,763 --> 00:12:33,803
Then you need to go back to church
and ask God for a third option.

213
00:12:33,973 --> 00:12:35,803
I think God is dead.

214
00:12:35,973 --> 00:12:38,313
The sign of a true Catholic.

215
00:12:48,983 --> 00:12:52,153
Good afternoon, Mrs. Reynolds.

216
00:12:52,323 --> 00:12:53,953
I'm from the EPA.

217
00:12:55,073 --> 00:12:57,873
We're checking on possible
Freon leaks.

218
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:00,333
Tell me,
do you have air conditioning?

219
00:13:00,503 --> 00:13:02,123
Yes, we have central air.

220
00:13:02,293 --> 00:13:03,793
In every room?

221
00:13:03,963 --> 00:13:05,673
Except the bathroom. Why?

222
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:07,752
Well, you know
what that means, don't you?

223
00:13:19,142 --> 00:13:20,722
Move.

224
00:13:27,362 --> 00:13:30,982
No pleasure, no rapture,
no exquisite sin greater...

225
00:13:31,742 --> 00:13:33,992
...than central air.

226
00:13:34,702 --> 00:13:36,862
Pick that up.

227
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:44,162
This will be the base of operations
from here on in.

228
00:13:44,332 --> 00:13:47,132
Now, if I remember
the protocol correctly...

229
00:13:47,292 --> 00:13:52,052
...the powers will attempt
to contact the last scion.

230
00:13:52,212 --> 00:13:54,262
I need you three...

231
00:13:54,432 --> 00:13:57,512
...to shuffle her loose
the mortal coil.

232
00:14:01,642 --> 00:14:02,682
Go.

233
00:14:37,092 --> 00:14:39,352
Behold the Metatron!

234
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:42,181
Herald of the Almighty
and voice of the one true god!

235
00:14:42,971 --> 00:14:44,931
Behold the Metatron!

236
00:14:45,101 --> 00:14:49,101
Herald of the Almighty
and voice of the one true god!

237
00:14:49,271 --> 00:14:50,481
Behold the Metatron!

238
00:14:50,651 --> 00:14:54,281
Herald of the Almighty
and voice of the one true...

239
00:15:05,621 --> 00:15:08,581
Sweet Jesus!
Do you have to use the whole can?

240
00:15:08,751 --> 00:15:11,631
Who the fuck are you and what
the fuck are you doing in my room?

241
00:15:11,801 --> 00:15:14,551
I'm soaked and she's
the one that's surly. That's rich.

242
00:15:14,711 --> 00:15:16,551
Stubbed my fucking...

243
00:15:16,721 --> 00:15:18,971
Get the fuck out of here, now!

244
00:15:19,431 --> 00:15:21,641
Or you'll do what exactly?

245
00:15:21,811 --> 00:15:23,971
Hit me with that fish?

246
00:15:28,981 --> 00:15:31,821
Now, just sit down on the bed
and shut up.

247
00:15:31,981 --> 00:15:34,481
Jesus wept!

248
00:15:34,651 --> 00:15:36,321
Look at my suit.

249
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:40,281
Take what you want,
but don't kill or rape me.

250
00:15:40,451 --> 00:15:44,741
Give over! I couldn't rape you
if I wanted to. Angels are ill-equipped.

251
00:15:47,461 --> 00:15:48,501
See?

252
00:15:51,131 --> 00:15:53,921
I'm as anatomically impaired
as a Ken doll.

253
00:15:55,131 --> 00:15:57,171
Make yourself useful
and give me that towel.

254
00:15:58,301 --> 00:16:00,641
Honestly, you bottom-feeders
and your arrogance.

255
00:16:00,801 --> 00:16:03,471
You think everybody's just trying
to get in your knickers.

256
00:16:03,891 --> 00:16:05,141
What are you?

257
00:16:05,311 --> 00:16:07,181
I'm pissed off is what I am.

258
00:16:07,351 --> 00:16:11,311
Do you drench everyone who comes in
here with flame-retardant chemicals?

259
00:16:11,481 --> 00:16:13,941
No wonder you're single.

260
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,200
Stand back.

261
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:30,870
As I was saying...

262
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,170
...prior to your
fire-fighting episode...

263
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,720
...I am the Metatron.

264
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,220
Don't tell me the name
doesn't ring a bell.

265
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:46,470
You people.

266
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:50,730
If there isn't a movie about it,
it's not worth knowing, is it?

267
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,730
I am a seraphim.

268
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,400
The highest choir of angels.

269
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,700
You do know what an angel is,
don't you?

270
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,330
Metatron acts as the voice of God.

271
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,620
Any occasion when some yahoo
claims that God has spoken to them...

272
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,420
...they're speaking to me.

273
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,750
Or they're talking to themselves.

274
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,920
Why doesn't God speak for himself?

275
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:24,140
Glad you decided to join
the conversation. To answer that...

276
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,640
...human beings have neither the aural
nor the psychological capacity...

277
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:31,940
...to withstand the awesome power
of God's true voice.

278
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:35,520
Were you to hear it, your mind would
cave in and your heart would explode.

279
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:38,440
We went through five Adams
before we figured that one out.

280
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:42,360
Well, how do I know
you're an angel?

281
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:47,370
What, aside from the fiery entrance
and the expansive wingspan?

282
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,459
You want more proof?

283
00:17:51,619 --> 00:17:53,169
Fine.

284
00:17:53,329 --> 00:17:54,459
How about tequila?

285
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:03,129
Where the hell are we?

286
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:05,679
Only place you can go
for a good tequila.

287
00:18:05,849 --> 00:18:08,929
Dos tequilas, por favor,
and an empty glass.

288
00:18:10,979 --> 00:18:12,639
We're in Mexico?

289
00:18:12,809 --> 00:18:15,309
Actually, we're in the franchised
Mexican eatery...

290
00:18:15,479 --> 00:18:17,479
...down the street
from your apartment...

291
00:18:17,649 --> 00:18:19,399
...but it's impressive nonetheless.

292
00:18:19,989 --> 00:18:22,069
You don't mind I lost the wings,
do you?

293
00:18:22,239 --> 00:18:24,159
I'm trying to keep our profile low.

294
00:18:24,659 --> 00:18:25,989
What do you want with me?

295
00:18:28,619 --> 00:18:32,499
I am to charge you
with a holy crusade.

296
00:18:32,669 --> 00:18:35,829
For the record,
I work in an abortion clinic.

297
00:18:35,999 --> 00:18:38,249
Noah was a drunk.
Look what he accomplished.

298
00:18:38,419 --> 00:18:40,299
And no one's asking you
to build an ark.

299
00:18:40,459 --> 00:18:42,299
All you gotta do is go
to New Jersey...

300
00:18:42,469 --> 00:18:44,929
...and visit a small church
on a very important day.

301
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:50,679
New Jersey?

302
00:18:51,929 --> 00:18:53,979
That doesn't sound like
much of a crusade.

303
00:18:54,149 --> 00:18:56,519
Aside from the fine print,
that's it.

304
00:18:56,689 --> 00:18:58,689
What's the fine print?

305
00:18:59,609 --> 00:19:02,689
Stop a couple angels from entering
and thus negating all existence.

306
00:19:02,859 --> 00:19:04,989
Wait, wait, wait. Repeat that.

307
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:08,239
Stop a couple of angels
from entering...

308
00:19:08,409 --> 00:19:11,369
...and thus negating all existence.

309
00:19:11,539 --> 00:19:13,869
I hate it when people
need it spelled out for them.

310
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:15,829
You might want to clarify that.

311
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:21,209
Back in the old days,
God was vengeful and hot-tempered.

312
00:19:21,379 --> 00:19:23,379
And his wrath was bore...

313
00:19:23,549 --> 00:19:26,718
...by the Angel of Death,
name of Loki.

314
00:19:26,888 --> 00:19:28,968
When Sodom and Gomorrah
was destroyed...

315
00:19:29,138 --> 00:19:30,558
...that was Loki.

316
00:19:30,718 --> 00:19:34,638
When the waters wiped out everything
except Noah and his menagerie...

317
00:19:34,808 --> 00:19:37,478
...that was Loki.
And he was good at what he did.

318
00:19:38,228 --> 00:19:42,358
But one day he refused to
bear God's wrath any longer.

319
00:19:43,068 --> 00:19:45,818
- Why?
- He listened to his friend...

320
00:19:45,988 --> 00:19:48,068
...a Grigori
by the name of Bartleby.

321
00:19:48,238 --> 00:19:49,238
Grigori?

322
00:19:49,408 --> 00:19:52,538
One of the choirs of angels.
They're called Watchers.

323
00:19:52,698 --> 00:19:54,078
Guess what they do.

324
00:19:54,248 --> 00:19:58,578
So one day, Loki's wiping out
all the firstborn of Egypt...

325
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:01,168
The Tenth Plague.

326
00:20:01,338 --> 00:20:03,838
Tell a person you're the Metatron,
they stare blankly.

327
00:20:04,008 --> 00:20:06,128
Mention something in
a Charlton Heston movie...

328
00:20:06,298 --> 00:20:08,428
...and suddenly everybody's
a theology scholar.

329
00:20:08,598 --> 00:20:10,428
May I continue uninterrupted?

330
00:20:10,598 --> 00:20:12,558
Once he's done with the firstborn...

331
00:20:12,718 --> 00:20:17,308
...Loki takes his friend Bartleby out
for a post-slaughter drink.

332
00:20:17,478 --> 00:20:19,728
And over many rounds...

333
00:20:19,898 --> 00:20:21,938
...they get into
this discussion about...

334
00:20:22,108 --> 00:20:23,938
...whether murder
in God's name is okay.

335
00:20:24,108 --> 00:20:25,358
And in the end...

336
00:20:25,528 --> 00:20:29,408
...Bartleby convinces Loki
to quit his position...

337
00:20:29,578 --> 00:20:31,788
...and take one which doesn't
involve slaughter.

338
00:20:31,948 --> 00:20:33,448
So...

339
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:37,288
...very inebriated...

340
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,998
...Loki tells God he quits...

341
00:20:40,168 --> 00:20:42,378
...throws down his fiery sword...

342
00:20:42,548 --> 00:20:44,418
...and gives him the finger.

343
00:20:44,588 --> 00:20:47,628
Which ruins it for the rest of us
because from that day forward...

344
00:20:47,798 --> 00:20:50,798
...God decreed that angels
could no longer imbibe alcohol.

345
00:20:50,968 --> 00:20:52,388
Hence all the spitting.

346
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:54,888
So for their insolence...

347
00:20:55,058 --> 00:20:57,888
...God decreed that neither Loki
nor Bartleby...

348
00:20:58,058 --> 00:21:00,607
...would ever be allowed
back into Paradise.

349
00:21:00,767 --> 00:21:02,477
- Were they sent to hell?
- Worse.

350
00:21:02,857 --> 00:21:04,477
Wisconsin...

351
00:21:04,647 --> 00:21:07,277
...for the entire span
of human history.

352
00:21:07,447 --> 00:21:10,907
And when the world ends, they'll have
to sit outside the gates for eternity.

353
00:21:11,077 --> 00:21:12,827
And this has what to do with me?

354
00:21:12,987 --> 00:21:17,367
Someone has clued them in
to a loophole in Catholic dogma...

355
00:21:17,537 --> 00:21:20,077
...that would allow them
to reenter heaven.

356
00:21:20,247 --> 00:21:22,837
So what? They beat the system.
Good for them.

357
00:21:22,997 --> 00:21:24,837
It's not that simple.

358
00:21:25,007 --> 00:21:29,377
If they get in, they will have
reversed God's decree.

359
00:21:30,717 --> 00:21:34,007
Now listen closely because
this bit's very important.

360
00:21:34,847 --> 00:21:38,807
Existence in all its form
and splendor...

361
00:21:38,977 --> 00:21:42,517
...functions solely on one principle:

362
00:21:42,687 --> 00:21:45,647
God is infallible.

363
00:21:45,817 --> 00:21:47,647
To prove him wrong...

364
00:21:47,817 --> 00:21:50,697
...would undo reality
and everything that is.

365
00:21:50,867 --> 00:21:53,657
Up would become down,
black would become white.

366
00:21:53,827 --> 00:21:56,697
Existence would
become nothingness.

367
00:21:56,867 --> 00:21:58,407
In essence...

368
00:21:59,497 --> 00:22:01,957
...if they're allowed to enter
that church...

369
00:22:03,797 --> 00:22:06,707
...they'll unmake the world.

370
00:22:07,167 --> 00:22:09,717
If this is so major,
why are you talking to me?

371
00:22:09,887 --> 00:22:11,717
Why doesn't God
do something about it?

372
00:22:11,887 --> 00:22:15,717
He could. But he'd rather see you
take care of this one personally.

373
00:22:16,307 --> 00:22:17,477
Why me?

374
00:22:18,057 --> 00:22:19,847
Because of who you are.

375
00:22:20,017 --> 00:22:21,727
And who am I?

376
00:22:22,227 --> 00:22:23,937
The girl in the P.J.'s!

377
00:22:24,107 --> 00:22:27,737
Don't ask so many questions.
Just serve your purpose.

378
00:22:27,897 --> 00:22:29,857
I'm gonna have to pass.

379
00:22:30,777 --> 00:22:31,907
I beg your pardon?

380
00:22:32,067 --> 00:22:36,406
When some quiet little infection
destroyed my uterus, where was God?

381
00:22:36,576 --> 00:22:38,076
When my husband decided...

382
00:22:38,246 --> 00:22:40,826
...he couldn't be with a wife
who couldn't bear children...

383
00:22:40,996 --> 00:22:42,036
...where was God?

384
00:22:44,586 --> 00:22:45,706
To hell with him.

385
00:22:45,876 --> 00:22:49,916
Don't allow eons of history and life
to get blinked out of being...

386
00:22:50,086 --> 00:22:52,336
...just because of a grudge
against your creator.

387
00:22:52,506 --> 00:22:54,846
So you lost the ability
to make life.

388
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:58,426
You're being offered the chance
to play mother to the world...

389
00:22:58,596 --> 00:23:00,766
...by acting like one
and protecting it.

390
00:23:00,936 --> 00:23:02,856
Saving it!

391
00:23:05,396 --> 00:23:07,316
But I can't make you.

392
00:23:08,436 --> 00:23:10,986
However, if you should decide
to stop being selfish...

393
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:13,566
...and accept your responsibility...

394
00:23:13,736 --> 00:23:15,526
...you won't be alone.

395
00:23:15,696 --> 00:23:16,946
You'll have support.

396
00:23:17,116 --> 00:23:19,116
What? More angels?

397
00:23:19,286 --> 00:23:20,866
Prophets.

398
00:23:22,786 --> 00:23:25,836
In a manner of speaking.
Two of them.

399
00:23:28,416 --> 00:23:30,836
The one who speaks...

400
00:23:31,006 --> 00:23:34,336
And he will, at great length,
whether you want him to or not.

401
00:23:34,506 --> 00:23:36,596
- will make mention of himself
as a prophet.

402
00:23:36,756 --> 00:23:38,136
The other one...

403
00:23:39,176 --> 00:23:40,886
...well, he's the quiet type.

404
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,226
Look, I've gotta go.

405
00:23:42,396 --> 00:23:44,646
Remember, we're working
in a time frame here.

406
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:48,476
Hey.

407
00:23:49,146 --> 00:23:51,316
- What's he like?
- God?

408
00:23:53,446 --> 00:23:55,026
Lonely...

409
00:23:55,196 --> 00:23:56,986
...but funny.

410
00:23:57,156 --> 00:23:59,076
He's got a great sense of humor.

411
00:23:59,246 --> 00:24:01,246
Sex, for example.
There's nothing funnier...

412
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:03,996
...than the ridiculous faces
you people make mid-coitus.

413
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:05,996
Sex is a joke in heaven?

414
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:09,875
The way I understand it,
it's mostly a joke down here too.

415
00:24:10,045 --> 00:24:11,255
I'll see you.

416
00:26:14,374 --> 00:26:17,124
Snootch to
the motherfucking nootch!

417
00:26:53,334 --> 00:26:56,714
Go back to your paper routes,
you Mighty Duck Fucks!

418
00:26:57,834 --> 00:27:00,254
Snoogans.
Did you see that shit, man?

419
00:27:00,424 --> 00:27:04,514
I know they were just kids, but we
kicked their fucking pubeless asses!

420
00:27:09,934 --> 00:27:12,314
I don't know what to say
or think, except...

421
00:27:12,474 --> 00:27:14,314
That you'll offer us sex
as a reward?

422
00:27:14,484 --> 00:27:17,644
That I'd like to know
who they and you are.

423
00:27:17,814 --> 00:27:20,563
I'm Jay, and this is
my hetero life mate, Silent Bob.

424
00:27:20,733 --> 00:27:23,363
I don't know those kids,
but they would have kicked yours...

425
00:27:23,533 --> 00:27:26,193
...and lunchbox's asses
if I hadn't represented.

426
00:27:26,363 --> 00:27:29,073
Well, thanks for being
out here so late.

427
00:27:29,243 --> 00:27:31,373
Wait a minute. Are you protestors?

428
00:27:31,533 --> 00:27:34,453
You mean those dickheads with signs
and pictures of dead babies?

429
00:27:34,623 --> 00:27:36,873
Shit, no!
Me and Silent Bob are pro-choice.

430
00:27:37,043 --> 00:27:39,003
A woman's body
is her own fucking business.

431
00:27:39,173 --> 00:27:41,043
But what are you doing
hanging around?

432
00:27:41,213 --> 00:27:43,173
We're here to pick up chicks.

433
00:27:43,963 --> 00:27:45,003
Excuse me?

434
00:27:45,173 --> 00:27:48,223
We figure abortion clinics are
a good place to meet loose women.

435
00:27:48,383 --> 00:27:51,053
Why else would they be here
unless they like to fuck?

436
00:27:52,013 --> 00:27:54,063
Right.

437
00:27:54,223 --> 00:27:56,893
Well, I should be going.
Thanks for the rescue.

438
00:27:57,063 --> 00:27:58,773
- I think.
- Wait a second.

439
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:01,523
We just saved your ass,
and you're just gonna take off.

440
00:28:01,693 --> 00:28:02,733
What the shit is that?

441
00:28:02,903 --> 00:28:06,693
I had a weird night last night and
tonight's not shaping up to be better.

442
00:28:06,863 --> 00:28:09,743
I think I should go home,
take some Percosets and lay down.

443
00:28:11,163 --> 00:28:14,453
Now, how about that shit?
Fuck this town, man!

444
00:28:14,623 --> 00:28:17,253
I'm going back to Jersey
and starting the business again.

445
00:28:17,413 --> 00:28:21,083
I can kick the shit out of kids
in Red Bank and make myself a profit.

446
00:28:21,253 --> 00:28:23,673
Prophets. Two of them.

447
00:28:23,843 --> 00:28:25,553
You know what I'm saying,
Silent Bob?

448
00:28:25,713 --> 00:28:27,553
You gotta be kidding me.

449
00:28:27,723 --> 00:28:30,263
We call this piece "The Fecalator."

450
00:28:30,433 --> 00:28:32,973
One look at it and the target
shits him or herself.

451
00:28:33,143 --> 00:28:34,563
Try it on.

452
00:28:35,353 --> 00:28:37,733
It's a lot more compact
than the flaming sword...

453
00:28:37,893 --> 00:28:39,853
...but it's not nearly as impressive.

454
00:28:40,023 --> 00:28:43,233
It doesn't have that
"wrath of the Almighty" edge to it.

455
00:28:43,403 --> 00:28:47,443
How am I supposed to strike fear into
the hearts of the wicked with this?

456
00:28:47,613 --> 00:28:48,613
Look at this.

457
00:28:49,113 --> 00:28:53,372
Well, then, you know, don't use a gun.
Lay the place to waste like.

458
00:28:53,532 --> 00:28:56,372
Easy for you to say.
You get off light in a razing.

459
00:28:56,542 --> 00:28:58,752
You got to stand and read
at Sodom and Gomorrah.

460
00:28:58,912 --> 00:29:00,752
I had to do all the work.

461
00:29:00,922 --> 00:29:04,042
What work did you do?
You lit a few fires.

462
00:29:04,212 --> 00:29:06,752
I rained down sulfur, man.
There's a subtle difference.

463
00:29:06,922 --> 00:29:08,512
Okay, I'm sure.

464
00:29:08,672 --> 00:29:12,472
Fuck you, man. Any moron with
a pack of matches can set a fire.

465
00:29:12,642 --> 00:29:14,512
Raining down sulfur
is an endurance trial.

466
00:29:14,682 --> 00:29:17,392
Mass genocide is the most
exhausting activity one can do...

467
00:29:17,562 --> 00:29:19,062
...next to soccer.

468
00:29:20,482 --> 00:29:22,272
I'll take this one.

469
00:29:35,792 --> 00:29:39,162
So, what's up? You have a friend for
Silent Bob, or you gonna do us both?

470
00:29:39,332 --> 00:29:41,622
If so, I'm first.
I hate sloppy seconds.

471
00:29:41,792 --> 00:29:43,752
You're a man of principle.

472
00:29:43,922 --> 00:29:47,462
Jersey's pretty far from McHenry.
May I ask what brought you here?

473
00:29:47,632 --> 00:29:50,012
Some fuck named John Hughes.

474
00:29:50,172 --> 00:29:51,762
Sixteen Candles John Hughes?

475
00:29:52,682 --> 00:29:56,012
You know that guy too?
That fucking guy.

476
00:29:56,182 --> 00:29:58,852
He made this flick Sixteen Candles.
Not bad.

477
00:29:59,022 --> 00:30:00,932
There's tits in it, but no bush.

478
00:30:01,102 --> 00:30:03,852
But Ebert here don't give
a shit about that kind of thing...

479
00:30:04,022 --> 00:30:06,362
...because he's in love
with this John Hughes guy.

480
00:30:06,522 --> 00:30:08,612
He goes out and rents
every one of his movies.

481
00:30:08,782 --> 00:30:13,112
Fucking Breakfast Club, where stupid
kids actually show up for detention.

482
00:30:13,282 --> 00:30:16,992
Fucking Weird Science, where this
babe wants to undress and get down...

483
00:30:17,162 --> 00:30:20,202
...but, oh, no, she don't,
because it's a PG movie.

484
00:30:20,372 --> 00:30:24,462
And then Pretty in Pink, which I can't
watch with this tubby bitch anymore...

485
00:30:24,632 --> 00:30:27,881
...because when the redhead
hooks up with her dream guy...

486
00:30:28,051 --> 00:30:31,511
...he starts sobbing like a little bitch
with a skinned knee and shit.

487
00:30:31,681 --> 00:30:34,841
And there's nothing worse
than watching a fucking fat man weep.

488
00:30:35,011 --> 00:30:36,851
What exactly brought you
to Illinois?

489
00:30:37,011 --> 00:30:40,811
All these movies take place in this
small town called Shermer, Illinois...

490
00:30:40,981 --> 00:30:45,021
...where all the honeys are top-shelf
but all the dudes are whiny pussies.

491
00:30:45,191 --> 00:30:48,071
Except for Judd Nelson.
He was fucking harsh.

492
00:30:48,231 --> 00:30:49,401
But best of all...

493
00:30:49,571 --> 00:30:51,611
...there was no one dealing, man.

494
00:30:51,781 --> 00:30:54,031
Then it hits me.
We could live like phat rats...

495
00:30:54,201 --> 00:30:56,741
...if we were the blunt connection
in Shermer, Illinois.

496
00:30:56,911 --> 00:30:59,741
So we collected some money
we were owed and caught a bus.

497
00:30:59,911 --> 00:31:02,911
But you know what the fuck
we found out when we got there?

498
00:31:03,081 --> 00:31:05,921
There is no Shermer in Illinois.

499
00:31:06,081 --> 00:31:07,921
Movies are fucking bullshit.

500
00:31:08,091 --> 00:31:09,591
When are you going
to New Jersey?

501
00:31:09,761 --> 00:31:12,011
Jeez, this broad asks
a lot of questions.

502
00:31:12,171 --> 00:31:15,261
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.

503
00:31:15,431 --> 00:31:17,181
Yeah. So you do anal?

504
00:31:17,351 --> 00:31:19,761
Is it true chicks fart
if you blast them in the ass?

505
00:31:19,931 --> 00:31:21,771
I didn't ask you out for sex.

506
00:31:21,931 --> 00:31:23,811
I'll take head.

507
00:31:26,101 --> 00:31:29,771
This is gonna sound really bad. I can't
believe I'm even thinking about this...

508
00:31:32,401 --> 00:31:34,281
...but I think I should go with you.

509
00:31:34,451 --> 00:31:37,621
What, like steady?
You wanna be my girlfriend?

510
00:31:38,241 --> 00:31:41,371
All right, but Silent Bob gets
to live with us and you pay the rent.

511
00:31:41,541 --> 00:31:44,251
No. I wanna go with you
to New Jersey.

512
00:31:44,421 --> 00:31:45,421
Really?

513
00:31:45,581 --> 00:31:47,581
You're going to
lead me somewhere.

514
00:31:47,751 --> 00:31:49,211
Me lead you?

515
00:31:49,381 --> 00:31:52,171
Lady, look at me. I don't even know
where I am half the time.

516
00:31:52,341 --> 00:31:55,431
If we're not gonna fuck, then what
the fuck did you ask us out for?

517
00:31:55,591 --> 00:31:59,601
Someone said I'd meet you and you'd
take me someplace I'm supposed to go.

518
00:31:59,761 --> 00:32:01,640
What the hell are
you babbling about?

519
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:04,390
We saved your ass from
some angry fucking dwarves...

520
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:08,270
...and now we're supposed to take you
somewhere as if we know where it is?

521
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:11,940
Do you believe in God?

522
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,610
Holy fuck! All the fine, immoral bitches
out in front of that place...

523
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,200
...and we get the Jesus freak?

524
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:19,990
- Let's get out of here.
- No, wait.

525
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,790
- I'll scream rape.
- I can pay you.

526
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:24,200
Pay?

527
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:28,790
A hundred bucks
for being my guide.

528
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,960
You were going to Jersey anyway.
All I'm asking is to tag along.

529
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:36,510
I feel like Han Solo, you're Chewie,
and she's Ben Kenobi...

530
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,010
...and we're in that fucked-up bar!

531
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,600
What about sex?

532
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,010
No sex.

533
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:47,940
Let's say we're caught in a situation
where we have five minutes left to live.

534
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,520
A bomb or something's gonna go off.
Would you fuck us then?

535
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:53,650
In that highly unlikely situation?

536
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:58,200
Yeah, sure.

537
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:01,370
Yeah? She's a slut.

538
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,290
All right.

539
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:08,790
But I get to drive.

540
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:20,180
What gear are you in?

541
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,640
Gear?

542
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:33,230
Well, what do I know
about shifting?

543
00:33:36,859 --> 00:33:38,529
Like I ever drove before.

544
00:33:42,869 --> 00:33:45,199
Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania...

545
00:33:45,369 --> 00:33:46,699
...New Jersey.

546
00:33:46,869 --> 00:33:48,789
Maybe you're wrong
on the slaughter thing.

547
00:33:48,959 --> 00:33:51,749
How can you be sure what incurs
the Lord's wrath these days?

548
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:53,089
Times change.

549
00:33:53,249 --> 00:33:56,879
I remember eating meat on a Friday
used to be a hell-worthy trespass.

550
00:33:57,049 --> 00:33:59,469
The major sins never change.

551
00:34:00,889 --> 00:34:03,299
And besides, I can spot
a commandment-breaker...

552
00:34:03,469 --> 00:34:05,599
...from, like, a mile away.

553
00:34:05,769 --> 00:34:07,519
Bet on it.

554
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,479
This from the guy who still owes me
10 bucks over that bet...

555
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:13,769
...about which was gonna be the
bigger movie, E. T. or Krush Groove.

556
00:34:13,939 --> 00:34:17,109
You know, fuck you, man,
because time's gonna tell on that one.

557
00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:23,909
Are you insinuating that I don't have
what it takes anymore?

558
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:25,539
Insinuating, no.

559
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:28,249
Flat-out telling you.

560
00:34:31,249 --> 00:34:33,289
Right there. Right there.
There's one.

561
00:34:33,459 --> 00:34:35,589
So? They're kissing.

562
00:34:35,759 --> 00:34:36,799
Adultery.

563
00:34:36,969 --> 00:34:39,129
- Adultery?
- Adultery.

564
00:34:39,299 --> 00:34:41,219
You are just a simple creature.

565
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:43,849
- Am I right or what?
- I happen to know the truth.

566
00:34:44,009 --> 00:34:46,969
I'm not gonna tell. I wanna see
how boned up on the job you are.

567
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:49,809
- What's your proof?
- He's wearing a wedding band.

568
00:34:49,979 --> 00:34:52,599
And it never occurred to you
that maybe she's his wife?

569
00:34:52,769 --> 00:34:54,979
No married man kisses
his wife like that.

570
00:34:55,149 --> 00:34:57,819
Okay. Well, it's a good thing
you were never...

571
00:34:57,989 --> 00:35:00,859
...the deciding member on a jury
is all I'm saying.

572
00:35:01,029 --> 00:35:04,829
"No married man kisses his wife
like that"? Are you stoned?

573
00:35:04,989 --> 00:35:05,989
Excuse me.

574
00:35:08,829 --> 00:35:10,249
Are you married?

575
00:35:10,918 --> 00:35:12,118
Why?

576
00:35:12,288 --> 00:35:13,668
I'm just curious.

577
00:35:14,338 --> 00:35:16,088
What do you think?

578
00:35:24,718 --> 00:35:27,058
- What?
- To her?

579
00:35:27,218 --> 00:35:29,178
- What?
- Are you married to her?

580
00:35:29,348 --> 00:35:32,688
Not that it's any of
your fucking business, but no.

581
00:35:33,188 --> 00:35:34,608
Why?

582
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:21,398
Whose house?

583
00:36:21,568 --> 00:36:23,948
Run's house

584
00:36:24,108 --> 00:36:26,658
I said, whose house?

585
00:36:26,828 --> 00:36:28,658
Run's house

586
00:36:28,828 --> 00:36:30,868
Whose house
Say what?

587
00:36:31,038 --> 00:36:33,248
Run's house
Say what?

588
00:36:33,418 --> 00:36:36,878
Martin

589
00:36:39,088 --> 00:36:42,088
She's fucking pissed, dude.
She's never gonna fuck us now.

590
00:36:42,258 --> 00:36:44,178
Maybe you,
but definitely not me.

591
00:36:44,338 --> 00:36:46,427
Let me know how she is.

592
00:36:46,597 --> 00:36:49,347
Nobody is fucking me!
You got that?

593
00:36:50,267 --> 00:36:52,517
I don't know what I was thinking
in that diner...

594
00:36:52,687 --> 00:36:55,767
...but being that I've decided to
go home, and not to New Jersey...

595
00:36:55,937 --> 00:36:58,397
...sorry for the inconvenience,
and goodbye.

596
00:36:59,107 --> 00:37:00,607
You're breaking up with us?

597
00:37:02,027 --> 00:37:04,277
Who the hell do you think
you are, lady?

598
00:37:04,447 --> 00:37:07,367
You can't just go around
breaking people's hearts like that!

599
00:37:07,527 --> 00:37:10,697
I fell in love with you!
We fell in love with you!

600
00:37:10,867 --> 00:37:13,957
Guys like us just don't fall out
of the fucking sky, you know.

601
00:37:21,667 --> 00:37:25,587
Beautiful, naked, big-tittied women
just don't fall out of the sky, you know.

602
00:37:39,607 --> 00:37:40,977
No heartbeat.

603
00:37:41,147 --> 00:37:43,937
Think someone threw him out a plane
with a message on him...

604
00:37:44,107 --> 00:37:45,487
...like in Con Air?

605
00:37:45,657 --> 00:37:48,277
- Did you ever see that flick?
- Oh, did that suck!

606
00:37:48,447 --> 00:37:50,987
- Con Air? Con Shit.
- Kill it! Kill it!

607
00:37:51,157 --> 00:37:54,157
- Sounds familiar.
- Jesus, are you okay?

608
00:37:54,327 --> 00:37:56,327
Yeah, it's Rufus.
And yeah, I'm fine.

609
00:37:56,497 --> 00:37:58,667
He's the fucking undead!
Cut his head off!

610
00:37:58,837 --> 00:38:01,627
Hey! What I just did gave me
a fucking migraine!

611
00:38:01,797 --> 00:38:05,797
So if you don't pipe down, I'm gonna
yank your sac off like a paper towel.

612
00:38:05,967 --> 00:38:08,337
Speaking of which,
you're awfully nude.

613
00:38:08,507 --> 00:38:11,177
- Rufus, is it?
- Yes, Rufus it is.

614
00:38:11,347 --> 00:38:15,687
It's usually Long Rufus, but it's
a little cold out here. You understand.

615
00:38:15,847 --> 00:38:19,107
Big Papa, how about lending a brother
your coat till I find threads?

616
00:38:21,026 --> 00:38:23,276
Dude, he fell out of thin air.

617
00:38:24,396 --> 00:38:27,696
Dude, his piece is gonna be rubbing
inside of your armor.

618
00:38:27,866 --> 00:38:30,156
- Dude!
- Thanks a lot, baby.

619
00:38:31,366 --> 00:38:33,406
I'll do my best to tuck it back.

620
00:38:33,576 --> 00:38:36,036
It's been a while since physics
but I would think...

621
00:38:36,206 --> 00:38:39,036
...the impact with which you hit
would have liquefied you.

622
00:38:39,206 --> 00:38:40,876
Death is a worry of the living.

623
00:38:41,046 --> 00:38:44,506
The dead, like myself, only worry
about decay and necrophiliacs.

624
00:38:44,666 --> 00:38:47,296
- Told you he was the undead.
- Not the undead. The dead.

625
00:38:47,466 --> 00:38:48,506
I died.

626
00:38:48,676 --> 00:38:50,846
Christ told me the secret
to resurrection once.

627
00:38:51,006 --> 00:38:54,466
We were at this wedding in Canaan.
And I got drunk and forgot it.

628
00:38:54,636 --> 00:38:56,306
Wait, wait, wait.

629
00:38:56,476 --> 00:38:58,266
Christ?

630
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:00,396
You knew Christ?

631
00:39:00,556 --> 00:39:02,566
Knew him?
Shit, nigga owes me 12 bucks.

632
00:39:03,396 --> 00:39:04,476
Let me guess.

633
00:39:04,646 --> 00:39:07,066
- You're another angel?
- Oh, I ain't no angel.

634
00:39:07,236 --> 00:39:09,986
I'm a man, just like you and him.
Well, maybe not him.

635
00:39:10,156 --> 00:39:11,696
At least I was a man.

636
00:39:11,866 --> 00:39:14,946
Been dead nearly 2000 years.
Here, check this out.

637
00:39:16,156 --> 00:39:19,246
No wonder he saw Jesus.
Homey's rocking the ganj.

638
00:39:19,416 --> 00:39:21,496
It's not a joint.

639
00:39:21,666 --> 00:39:23,876
I can't read this.

640
00:39:24,046 --> 00:39:29,006
It's Aramaic. It says,
"Rufus, see you in two years. Jesus."

641
00:39:29,176 --> 00:39:32,256
Freaked me out because he basically
told me when my number was up.

642
00:39:32,426 --> 00:39:35,176
Took all the flavor out of
the remaining years. We gotta go.

643
00:39:35,346 --> 00:39:38,886
Let's say we continue this discussion
over a two-piece and a biscuit.

644
00:39:39,056 --> 00:39:41,556
I'm starving. Back off, Kato.

645
00:39:41,726 --> 00:39:42,896
Wait a second!

646
00:39:44,436 --> 00:39:46,736
Between guys with wings,
guys falling out of the sky...

647
00:39:46,896 --> 00:39:48,776
...and guys trying like hell
to fuck me...

648
00:39:48,946 --> 00:39:51,906
...I think I've been a pretty good sport
about all this so far.

649
00:39:52,076 --> 00:39:55,365
But I'm not going anywhere until
I find out where you came from.

650
00:39:55,535 --> 00:39:57,405
Me? I came from heaven.

651
00:39:57,575 --> 00:39:58,955
Now let's start walking.

652
00:39:59,115 --> 00:40:01,915
Walk? Fuck you! Do you know
how far we are from anywheres?

653
00:40:02,085 --> 00:40:06,165
Hey, man, back in the old days
with J.C., we used to walk everywhere.

654
00:40:06,335 --> 00:40:08,585
Did you ever hear of
a fat apostle?

655
00:40:13,175 --> 00:40:15,465
What the hell's an apostle?

656
00:40:39,165 --> 00:40:40,415
Let me get this straight.

657
00:40:40,575 --> 00:40:42,785
She's already met the prophets...

658
00:40:42,955 --> 00:40:44,955
...and the apostle's with them?

659
00:40:48,005 --> 00:40:50,175
I think that our best course
of action...

660
00:40:50,335 --> 00:40:53,755
...is to ensure that our parcel
is not found.

661
00:40:53,925 --> 00:40:58,475
And being that I can't even
trust you enough to kill a woman...

662
00:41:00,185 --> 00:41:02,685
...well, I'm left with no choice...

663
00:41:02,855 --> 00:41:06,895
...but to seek outside assistance
in guarding said package.

664
00:41:10,315 --> 00:41:12,355
I'm gonna have to summon
the Golgothan.

665
00:41:15,525 --> 00:41:17,865
I appreciate the loan.
You can have that back.

666
00:41:18,035 --> 00:41:21,325
I remember when all we had
for breakfast was fish and goat's milk.

667
00:41:21,495 --> 00:41:23,875
- What do you call this shit?
- Egga Mooby Muffin.

668
00:41:24,035 --> 00:41:27,125
Now, how about you start
explaining things, like for starters...

669
00:41:27,295 --> 00:41:28,624
...how did you find us?

670
00:41:28,794 --> 00:41:31,044
You know what the dead do
with most of their time?

671
00:41:31,214 --> 00:41:33,884
Watch the living.
Especially in the shower.

672
00:41:34,044 --> 00:41:35,544
I can't wait to die.

673
00:41:35,714 --> 00:41:37,464
And why are you watching me?

674
00:41:37,634 --> 00:41:39,884
Because you're gonna help me
get changes made...

675
00:41:40,054 --> 00:41:41,884
...in that book
you put so much stock in.

676
00:41:42,054 --> 00:41:44,344
- Hustler?
- The Bible!

677
00:41:44,514 --> 00:41:47,724
- What's your beef with the Bible?
- For starters, I'm not in it.

678
00:41:47,894 --> 00:41:50,394
Neither are we. You don't
hear us bitching and moaning.

679
00:41:50,564 --> 00:41:53,904
But I'm supposed to be in it.
I was the 13th apostle.

680
00:41:55,574 --> 00:41:59,574
I've gone to church my whole life and
never heard of Rufus, the 13th apostle.

681
00:41:59,744 --> 00:42:02,414
Yeah, but you heard of
the other 12 apostles.

682
00:42:02,574 --> 00:42:06,084
Yeah, all white boys, I might add.
But no mention of me, Rufus.

683
00:42:06,244 --> 00:42:08,704
And why is that?
Because I'm a black man.

684
00:42:08,874 --> 00:42:10,874
But you know what?
That's just my pet peeve.

685
00:42:11,044 --> 00:42:15,384
I'm mainly here to correct a major error
you've been basing the faith on.

686
00:42:15,544 --> 00:42:19,014
- What's that?
- Jesus wasn't white. Jesus was black.

687
00:42:19,174 --> 00:42:20,264
I don't buy it.

688
00:42:20,424 --> 00:42:24,514
If that's true, why did he get
written about and you were left out?

689
00:42:24,684 --> 00:42:26,644
Well, he is the son of God.

690
00:42:26,814 --> 00:42:29,104
Kind of hard to have
a New Testament without him.

691
00:42:29,274 --> 00:42:31,934
So you fudge a few facts,
you put a spin on his ethnicity.

692
00:42:32,104 --> 00:42:35,604
Leaving me out's okay because you
still got 12 white boys to choose from.

693
00:42:35,774 --> 00:42:37,114
You gonna listen to this shit?

694
00:42:37,274 --> 00:42:39,364
That's what the good people
of Antioch said...

695
00:42:39,534 --> 00:42:41,244
...right before they stoned my ass.

696
00:42:41,404 --> 00:42:42,454
You were martyred?

697
00:42:42,614 --> 00:42:44,454
That's one way of putting it.

698
00:42:44,614 --> 00:42:47,584
Another way is to say I was
bludgeoned by big fucking rocks.

699
00:42:47,744 --> 00:42:50,454
White folks only wanna hear
the good shit:

700
00:42:50,624 --> 00:42:52,794
Life eternal,
a place in God's heaven.

701
00:42:52,964 --> 00:42:55,544
But as soon as you hear
you're getting this good shit...

702
00:42:55,714 --> 00:42:57,254
...from a black Jesus, you freak.

703
00:42:57,424 --> 00:42:59,554
And that, my friends,
is called hypocrisy.

704
00:42:59,714 --> 00:43:04,303
A black man can steal your stereo,
but he can't be your savior.

705
00:43:04,473 --> 00:43:05,763
Gonna eat that hash brown?

706
00:43:06,853 --> 00:43:08,723
So you went to heaven?

707
00:43:08,893 --> 00:43:11,893
Damn right I went to heaven!
Shit, that's the least he could do.

708
00:43:12,063 --> 00:43:15,563
In the three years I followed his ass
around Jerusalem, did I ever get laid?

709
00:43:15,733 --> 00:43:18,613
Hell, no. And I was in my prime.

710
00:43:18,783 --> 00:43:21,323
I could have been knee-deep
in shepherds' daughters...

711
00:43:21,493 --> 00:43:23,993
...not to mention fine-ass
Mary Magdalene.

712
00:43:24,163 --> 00:43:25,993
She had a thing for dark meat.

713
00:43:26,163 --> 00:43:29,123
Maybe this is just me talking,
but if I were in heaven...

714
00:43:29,293 --> 00:43:32,293
...I wouldn't care what the Bible said
as long as the message was right.

715
00:43:32,463 --> 00:43:34,503
The message is what counts.

716
00:43:34,673 --> 00:43:38,343
But folks who build their faith
on that message should be colorblind.

717
00:43:38,503 --> 00:43:41,513
And all my rabble-rousing
is not doing that much above.

718
00:43:41,673 --> 00:43:43,383
So I'm gonna need
some help down here.

719
00:43:43,553 --> 00:43:47,303
That's why I'm gonna help stop those
angels from getting into that church...

720
00:43:47,473 --> 00:43:49,973
...in exchange for you helping me
with my campaign.

721
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:52,813
How do you know about that,
the angels?

722
00:43:52,983 --> 00:43:56,023
- Isn't much I don't know about you.
- I find that hard to believe.

723
00:43:56,193 --> 00:44:00,363
When you were 5, you let a kid
from next door piss in your hand.

724
00:44:00,533 --> 00:44:03,863
You did that shit? You're nasty.

725
00:44:04,033 --> 00:44:06,453
I never told anybody about that.

726
00:44:06,613 --> 00:44:08,203
Neither did he.

727
00:44:08,373 --> 00:44:11,123
Two years later,
that kid died of leukemia.

728
00:44:11,293 --> 00:44:13,873
- His name was Brian Johnson.
- Brian Johnson.

729
00:44:14,043 --> 00:44:16,123
See, your exploits,
no matter how inane...

730
00:44:16,293 --> 00:44:18,213
...are well documented in heaven.

731
00:44:18,383 --> 00:44:20,133
Probably hell too.

732
00:44:25,723 --> 00:44:27,013
Where are you going?

733
00:44:27,183 --> 00:44:28,893
Yo, man, tell me
something about me.

734
00:44:29,053 --> 00:44:31,933
You masturbate more
than anyone on the planet.

735
00:44:32,103 --> 00:44:34,893
Fuck. Everyone knows that.
Tell me something nobody knows.

736
00:44:35,063 --> 00:44:37,402
When you do it,
you're thinking about guys.

737
00:44:40,822 --> 00:44:43,692
- Dude, not all the time.
- Sorry if I scared you.

738
00:44:46,862 --> 00:44:50,742
Two-thirds of me wants to
forget about this and go home.

739
00:44:50,912 --> 00:44:53,412
Yesterday, I wasn't sure
if God even existed.

740
00:44:53,582 --> 00:44:57,002
Now I'm up to my ass
in Christian mythology.

741
00:44:57,172 --> 00:45:00,922
Let me let you in
on a little inside info.

742
00:45:01,092 --> 00:45:06,052
God hates it when
it's referred to as "mythology."

743
00:45:06,882 --> 00:45:11,682
Oh, well, then let's ask the "prophets"
what we should call it instead.

744
00:45:14,642 --> 00:45:16,982
Where did those two assholes go?

745
00:45:34,792 --> 00:45:36,792
What are you doing?

746
00:45:36,962 --> 00:45:38,872
Proving to this bastard
I ain't gay.

747
00:45:39,042 --> 00:45:40,962
- What?
- Long story. Forget it.

748
00:45:41,132 --> 00:45:43,382
We gotta get moving.
How can we get to Jersey?

749
00:45:43,552 --> 00:45:45,462
The train. I'll call for reservations.

750
00:46:42,361 --> 00:46:45,231
I thought she looked familiar.

751
00:46:45,401 --> 00:46:46,941
- Who?
- Serendipity.

752
00:47:00,331 --> 00:47:01,371
Morning, shoppers.

753
00:47:01,961 --> 00:47:03,211
Good morning.

754
00:47:04,171 --> 00:47:06,551
- Has anyone seen the overnights?
- No, sir.

755
00:47:07,971 --> 00:47:09,511
- We creamed them.
- All right.

756
00:47:12,221 --> 00:47:14,851
Last night was a rerun,
which says to me...

757
00:47:17,391 --> 00:47:19,351
Do I smell onions?

758
00:47:25,861 --> 00:47:27,111
Excuse me.

759
00:47:30,571 --> 00:47:33,031
May I ask what you're doing
in my boardroom?

760
00:47:33,991 --> 00:47:36,911
You may proceed, mon ami.

761
00:47:40,411 --> 00:47:42,501
I'm gonna have to start
by apologizing.

762
00:47:42,671 --> 00:47:45,501
My friend has a bit of a penchant
for the dramatic.

763
00:47:45,671 --> 00:47:47,250
Oh, come on!

764
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:52,470
Would you just relax? I'm doing it.

765
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:56,720
Mooby, the Golden Calf.

766
00:47:56,890 --> 00:48:01,180
Created by Nancy Goldruff,
a former kindergarten teacher, in 1989.

767
00:48:01,350 --> 00:48:04,020
Bought by the Complex Corporation
in 1991.

768
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:07,860
Broadcast nationally
as the Mooby Fun-Time Hour.

769
00:48:08,030 --> 00:48:12,450
Since its inception,
has spawned two theatrical films...

770
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:16,490
...16 records,
eight prime-time specials...

771
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:21,160
...and a library
of priced-to-own videocassettes.

772
00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:25,210
Not to mention
bicoastal theme parks...

773
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:27,840
...dubbed "Mooby World."

774
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,260
Did I miss anything?

775
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:32,090
You forgot Mooby Magazine.

776
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:33,590
Damn it!

777
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,390
Now, is there a point to this?

778
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:39,220
You and your board are idolaters.

779
00:48:41,310 --> 00:48:44,140
I can't believe you forgot
the magazine.

780
00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:47,820
That's you.

781
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:51,280
Do you know much about voodoo?

782
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:56,030
That's a fascinating practice.
No real doctrine of faith to speak of.

783
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,830
More an arrangement
of superstitions...

784
00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:00,910
...the most well-known of which...

785
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:02,500
...is the voodoo doll.

786
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:04,120
You see...

787
00:49:12,470 --> 00:49:15,430
...a mockup of an individual
is subjected...

788
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:17,640
...to various pokes and prods.

789
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:21,849
The desired result is that
the individual will feel those effects.

790
00:49:22,019 --> 00:49:23,479
- Call security, now!
- Yes, sir.

791
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:30,859
All lines are currently down.

792
00:49:31,029 --> 00:49:33,319
- I have to apologize...
- Would you knock it off?

793
00:49:33,489 --> 00:49:35,859
You're doing it again. Stop.
What did we talk about?

794
00:49:37,069 --> 00:49:40,369
You are responsible
for raising an icon...

795
00:49:40,539 --> 00:49:42,409
...which draws worship
from the Lord.

796
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:44,829
You have broken
the First Commandment.

797
00:49:45,289 --> 00:49:47,879
More than that,
I'm afraid not a one of you...

798
00:49:48,039 --> 00:49:50,709
...passes for a decent human being.

799
00:49:50,879 --> 00:49:55,219
Your continued existence
is a mockery of morality.

800
00:49:55,379 --> 00:49:57,219
Like you, Mr. Burton.

801
00:49:57,389 --> 00:50:00,809
Last year, you cheated on your wife
of 17 years eight times.

802
00:50:00,969 --> 00:50:03,059
You even had sex
with her best friend...

803
00:50:03,229 --> 00:50:07,479
...while you were supposed to
be home watching the kids.

804
00:50:07,649 --> 00:50:11,069
In the bed that you
and your wife share, no less.

805
00:50:11,229 --> 00:50:12,229
Mr. Newman.

806
00:50:12,399 --> 00:50:15,069
You got your girlfriend drunk
at last year's Christmas party...

807
00:50:15,239 --> 00:50:17,409
...and then paid a kid
from the mail room...

808
00:50:17,569 --> 00:50:20,029
...to have sex with her
while she was passed out...

809
00:50:20,199 --> 00:50:22,739
...just so you could break up
with her guilt-free...

810
00:50:22,909 --> 00:50:25,159
...when she sobbingly confessed
in the morning.

811
00:50:26,709 --> 00:50:29,419
She killed herself
three months later.

812
00:50:29,589 --> 00:50:32,419
Mr. Brace disowned his gay son.

813
00:50:32,589 --> 00:50:34,419
Very compassionate, Mr. Brace.

814
00:50:34,589 --> 00:50:37,589
Mr. Ray put his mother
in a third-rate nursing home...

815
00:50:37,759 --> 00:50:41,009
...and used the profits
from the sale of her home...

816
00:50:41,179 --> 00:50:44,929
...to buy an Oriental rug for himself.

817
00:50:45,099 --> 00:50:46,729
Heavens.

818
00:50:46,899 --> 00:50:49,519
Mr. Barker flew to Thailand
on the company account...

819
00:50:49,689 --> 00:50:53,279
...to have sex with
an 11-year-old boy.

820
00:50:53,439 --> 00:50:56,398
Mr. Holtzman okayed the production
of Mooby Dolls...

821
00:50:56,568 --> 00:50:59,238
...from materials he knew
to be toxic and unsafe...

822
00:50:59,408 --> 00:51:01,738
...because it was, survey says...

823
00:51:03,248 --> 00:51:05,038
...less costly.

824
00:51:05,208 --> 00:51:08,118
You, on the other hand...

825
00:51:08,288 --> 00:51:10,458
...are an innocent.

826
00:51:10,628 --> 00:51:12,418
You lead a good life.

827
00:51:12,588 --> 00:51:13,628
Good for you.

828
00:51:14,508 --> 00:51:17,508
But you, Mr. Whitland...

829
00:51:17,678 --> 00:51:21,548
...you have more skeletons in
your closet than this assembled party.

830
00:51:21,718 --> 00:51:24,388
I cannot even mention them aloud.

831
00:51:28,228 --> 00:51:31,858
You're his father, you sick fuck.

832
00:51:34,938 --> 00:51:36,488
- Good.
- Not bad, right?

833
00:51:36,648 --> 00:51:38,528
That's great work. Very good.

834
00:51:39,908 --> 00:51:41,408
Well...

835
00:51:42,578 --> 00:51:44,658
...alone at last.

836
00:51:44,828 --> 00:51:47,288
With the exception of
Miss Pryce here...

837
00:51:47,458 --> 00:51:51,168
...there isn't a decent human being
amongst you.

838
00:51:51,328 --> 00:51:52,998
Not one.

839
00:51:53,168 --> 00:51:56,668
Do you know what makes
a human being decent?

840
00:51:56,838 --> 00:51:58,008
Fear.

841
00:51:58,178 --> 00:52:00,178
And therein lies the problem.

842
00:52:00,338 --> 00:52:03,178
None of you has anything
left to fear anymore.

843
00:52:03,348 --> 00:52:06,678
You rest comfortably in seats
of inscrutable power...

844
00:52:06,848 --> 00:52:10,018
...hiding behind your false idol,
far from judgment...

845
00:52:10,188 --> 00:52:13,688
...lives shrouded in secrecy,
even from one another.

846
00:52:15,148 --> 00:52:17,068
But not from God.

847
00:52:22,068 --> 00:52:24,198
Forgot my little voodoo doll.

848
00:52:26,288 --> 00:52:29,867
Man, it really looks
just like you, doesn't it?

849
00:52:30,037 --> 00:52:33,707
Look, if I believed enough in this...

850
00:52:33,877 --> 00:52:35,417
...I wonder...

851
00:52:52,227 --> 00:52:55,567
Come on. I don't believe in voodoo.

852
00:52:59,697 --> 00:53:01,567
Voodoo.

853
00:53:08,657 --> 00:53:11,167
But I do believe in this.

854
00:53:11,327 --> 00:53:13,627
Don't run! Don't run!

855
00:53:13,787 --> 00:53:17,507
Fakes! Fakes! All of you, fakes!
Oh, and you!

856
00:53:19,047 --> 00:53:21,257
"But I do believe in this."

857
00:53:21,427 --> 00:53:22,757
What does that mean?

858
00:53:22,927 --> 00:53:24,257
And one to grow on.

859
00:53:30,437 --> 00:53:31,437
Gum?

860
00:53:32,847 --> 00:53:35,397
Go on. It's okay.

861
00:53:35,567 --> 00:53:37,527
You've done nothing wrong.

862
00:53:37,687 --> 00:53:40,697
These guys were fakes.

863
00:53:40,857 --> 00:53:43,107
You're a pure soul.

864
00:53:44,777 --> 00:53:47,277
But you didn't say "God bless you"
when I sneezed.

865
00:53:48,447 --> 00:53:50,247
Loki!

866
00:53:51,957 --> 00:53:53,287
You're getting off light.

867
00:53:53,457 --> 00:53:55,787
- Loki!
- I know. I'm coming.

868
00:53:59,457 --> 00:54:01,217
You're so lucky.

869
00:54:05,296 --> 00:54:08,096
I forgot you were down here.
How long now?

870
00:54:08,266 --> 00:54:09,596
Three years this August.

871
00:54:09,766 --> 00:54:13,306
Let me guess, 14th apostle, left out
of the Bible because she's a woman?

872
00:54:13,476 --> 00:54:14,646
This girl's no woman.

873
00:54:14,806 --> 00:54:17,726
Oh. Those weren't tits
I saw Jay cozying up to?

874
00:54:17,896 --> 00:54:19,526
What, these?

875
00:54:19,686 --> 00:54:23,816
You should know better than anyone
here that tits don't make a woman.

876
00:54:23,986 --> 00:54:26,276
The tubby, coat-wearing
motherfucker's got tits.

877
00:54:26,446 --> 00:54:29,866
What traditionally defines a woman
falls between two things:

878
00:54:30,036 --> 00:54:31,656
Her legs.

879
00:54:31,826 --> 00:54:34,166
But as you can see...

880
00:54:34,326 --> 00:54:35,996
...I lack definition.

881
00:54:36,166 --> 00:54:39,796
Hey, they're getting a free show!
Let me see that shit!

882
00:54:39,956 --> 00:54:42,876
Oh, God,
another angel like Metatron.

883
00:54:43,046 --> 00:54:45,636
How do you know...?
How does she know Metatron?

884
00:54:45,796 --> 00:54:47,676
This is the last scion.

885
00:54:48,676 --> 00:54:50,716
You're kidding.

886
00:54:53,226 --> 00:54:54,226
I'm confused.

887
00:54:54,396 --> 00:54:58,356
Bethany, Serendipity here
isn't technically an angel.

888
00:54:58,516 --> 00:55:02,146
Nor is she, by any means,
a human being like I was and you are.

889
00:55:02,316 --> 00:55:05,986
- I used to be an abstract.
- Now I'm really confused.

890
00:55:06,156 --> 00:55:07,616
I'm a muse, stupid.

891
00:55:08,736 --> 00:55:11,286
I can't take much more of this.

892
00:55:11,446 --> 00:55:13,036
So you, what, inspire people?

893
00:55:13,206 --> 00:55:15,366
What just went down
with your friends there...

894
00:55:15,536 --> 00:55:18,836
It doesn't take a muse to inspire
horny retards to empty their wallets.

895
00:55:18,996 --> 00:55:20,876
I used to specialize
in entertainment.

896
00:55:21,046 --> 00:55:26,466
For example, I'm responsible for 19 of
the 20 top-grossing films of all time.

897
00:55:26,636 --> 00:55:29,136
- Nineteen?
- Yeah.

898
00:55:29,306 --> 00:55:32,136
The one about the kid
by himself in his house...

899
00:55:32,306 --> 00:55:35,226
...burglars trying to come in
and he fights them off...

900
00:55:35,386 --> 00:55:37,556
...I had nothing to do
with that one.

901
00:55:38,056 --> 00:55:41,975
Somebody sold their soul to Satan to
get grosses up on that piece of shit.

902
00:56:00,415 --> 00:56:02,705
What are you doing stripping?

903
00:56:02,875 --> 00:56:04,215
You remember why I left?

904
00:56:04,375 --> 00:56:07,715
Because you were tired of getting
none of the credit for your ideas.

905
00:56:07,885 --> 00:56:10,925
So I opted to quit being a muse
and write for myself.

906
00:56:11,095 --> 00:56:14,925
I gave my two weeks' notice,
got a body, 50 bucks...

907
00:56:15,095 --> 00:56:18,055
...and got sent out into the world
to make my fortune.

908
00:56:18,225 --> 00:56:19,765
So, what happened?

909
00:56:20,975 --> 00:56:22,525
Writer's block.

910
00:56:22,685 --> 00:56:25,435
Can you believe it?
Me, a muse, for God's sake.

911
00:56:25,605 --> 00:56:29,565
I can inspire anyone I meet and give
out a zillion and nine ideas a second...

912
00:56:29,735 --> 00:56:31,575
...but I can't keep any for myself.

913
00:56:33,245 --> 00:56:35,575
Her quirky sense of humor.

914
00:56:35,745 --> 00:56:37,865
- Whose?
- God's.

915
00:56:38,035 --> 00:56:40,915
- You're saying God's a woman?
- Was there a doubt in your mind?

916
00:56:41,085 --> 00:56:42,795
He's always referred to as "him."

917
00:56:42,955 --> 00:56:44,505
Well, that's not how I wrote it.

918
00:56:44,665 --> 00:56:46,795
But one of the drawbacks
to being intangible...

919
00:56:46,965 --> 00:56:49,465
...is that you have no say
in the editorial process.

920
00:56:49,635 --> 00:56:52,635
The people that held the pens
added their own perspective...

921
00:56:52,805 --> 00:56:55,225
...and all the penholders were men.

922
00:56:55,385 --> 00:56:59,225
So she became a he.
Doesn't stop with God either.

923
00:56:59,395 --> 00:57:01,355
The whole book's gender-biased.

924
00:57:01,515 --> 00:57:03,645
A woman's responsible
for original sin.

925
00:57:03,815 --> 00:57:05,935
A woman cuts Samson's
coif of power.

926
00:57:06,105 --> 00:57:09,405
A woman asks for the head
of John the Baptist.

927
00:57:09,565 --> 00:57:10,945
Read that book again.

928
00:57:11,115 --> 00:57:14,154
Women are bigger antagonists than
Egyptians and Romans combined.

929
00:57:14,324 --> 00:57:15,494
It stinks.

930
00:57:21,954 --> 00:57:23,624
Why is the last scion here?

931
00:57:23,794 --> 00:57:26,664
Bartleby and Loki.
They found a way back.

932
00:57:26,834 --> 00:57:29,924
- Not the plenary-indulgence loophole.
- You know about that?

933
00:57:30,084 --> 00:57:32,594
I always knew that thing
was a bad idea.

934
00:57:32,754 --> 00:57:34,924
Leave it to the Catholics
to destroy existence.

935
00:57:35,094 --> 00:57:37,514
You have issues with Catholicism,
I take it?

936
00:57:37,684 --> 00:57:41,184
I have issues with those who treat God
like a burden instead of a blessing...

937
00:57:41,354 --> 00:57:42,604
...like some Catholics.

938
00:57:42,764 --> 00:57:45,644
You people don't celebrate your faith,
you mourn it.

939
00:57:45,814 --> 00:57:49,944
- If we're wrong, what religion is right?
- It's not about who's right or wrong.

940
00:57:50,104 --> 00:57:51,944
No denomination's nailed it yet...

941
00:57:52,114 --> 00:57:54,654
...because they're all
too self-righteous to realize...

942
00:57:54,824 --> 00:57:59,664
...that it doesn't matter what you have
faith in, Just that you have faith.

943
00:57:59,824 --> 00:58:04,164
Your hearts are in the right place,
but your brains gotta wake up.

944
00:58:06,624 --> 00:58:09,124
Look, they made me and Silent Bob
part of the gang.

945
00:58:15,094 --> 00:58:17,054
Who fucking farted?

946
00:58:18,554 --> 00:58:21,724
Not born. Shit into existence.

947
00:58:25,224 --> 00:58:27,984
Sweet Christ,
somebody wants you bad!

948
00:58:28,144 --> 00:58:30,564
- What is that thing?
- An excremental.

949
00:58:30,734 --> 00:58:32,904
- The Golgothan.
- A what?

950
00:58:33,074 --> 00:58:34,364
A shit demon!

951
00:58:34,534 --> 00:58:38,074
No man of woman born!

952
00:58:39,244 --> 00:58:42,034
- Friend of yours?
- Is this smelly fuck with us?

953
00:58:42,204 --> 00:58:43,744
It came for Bethany!

954
00:58:43,914 --> 00:58:46,744
Smoke that motherfucker
like it ain't no thing!

955
00:58:46,914 --> 00:58:49,253
Damn! I knew I was gonna
whack somebody today!

956
00:58:49,423 --> 00:58:51,253
Yo, get your fucking hand back.

957
00:58:51,423 --> 00:58:52,583
Represent!

958
00:58:54,043 --> 00:58:56,423
Go! Go! Go!

959
00:59:17,783 --> 00:59:20,113
Looks like we're in charge
of the gang now.

960
00:59:21,613 --> 00:59:23,033
Over the bar! Come on!

961
00:59:32,633 --> 00:59:35,963
- Where did that thing come from?
- Ever heard of Golgotha?

962
00:59:36,133 --> 00:59:38,013
The hill where Christ
was crucified?

963
00:59:38,173 --> 00:59:40,883
It wasn't just Christ.
The Romans crucified everyone there.

964
00:59:41,053 --> 00:59:44,473
Christ excluded, they were criminals.
Killers, brigands, thieves, rapists.

965
00:59:44,643 --> 00:59:47,723
Whenever the crucified expired,
their bodies lost muscle control...

966
00:59:47,893 --> 00:59:50,313
...spilling bowel and bladder
in the process...

967
00:59:50,483 --> 00:59:53,233
...the result of which is
that walking pile of crap there.

968
00:59:53,403 --> 00:59:56,403
The Golgothan shit demon,
hell's chief assassin.

969
00:59:56,573 --> 00:59:58,283
And it's here for you, girlie.

970
01:00:03,363 --> 01:00:05,953
- Bob, get down!
- Matches! Matches!

971
01:00:38,022 --> 01:00:40,532
- You the man.
- How?

972
01:00:42,362 --> 01:00:43,992
"Knocks strong odors out."

973
01:00:44,622 --> 01:00:47,622
- Way to go, biggie.
- Why would you ever carry this?

974
01:00:49,662 --> 01:00:50,792
What?

975
01:00:50,962 --> 01:00:52,792
Whoever sent this might send more.

976
01:00:52,962 --> 01:00:56,842
I suggest you take the princess
and get as far away as possible.

977
01:00:57,002 --> 01:00:59,462
I'll try to get something
out of poopy boy here.

978
01:00:59,632 --> 01:01:02,382
If he tells me something,
I'll let you know.

979
01:01:03,552 --> 01:01:05,892
Hello. We'd like two tickets
to New Jersey, please.

980
01:01:06,052 --> 01:01:08,682
- Jersey's sold out, sir.
- What?

981
01:01:08,852 --> 01:01:10,352
There's one same time tomorrow.

982
01:01:10,522 --> 01:01:14,352
Don't underestimate the staggering
drawing power of the Garden State...

983
01:01:14,522 --> 01:01:16,732
...and show up
two hours in advance.

984
01:01:19,072 --> 01:01:20,442
Nice.

985
01:01:20,612 --> 01:01:23,442
Your hard-on for smiting
has prevented us from negotiating...

986
01:01:23,612 --> 01:01:27,662
...what ought to be the relatively simple
matter of catching or staying on a bus.

987
01:01:27,832 --> 01:01:29,412
Bus, schmus.

988
01:01:29,582 --> 01:01:34,082
Why should we fall victim to gravity
when we can just as easily rise above?

989
01:01:34,252 --> 01:01:36,582
- You mean fly?
- We got wings, right?

990
01:01:36,752 --> 01:01:38,252
Fuck, let's use them!

991
01:01:38,422 --> 01:01:40,802
I wouldn't suggest that.

992
01:01:42,212 --> 01:01:43,972
You see, kids...

993
01:01:44,132 --> 01:01:47,762
...you wouldn't want to look like
a couple of fairies, now, would you?

994
01:01:53,182 --> 01:01:55,232
Look at this pimp.
How'd you get out of hell?

995
01:01:55,392 --> 01:01:57,521
I said I was coming up
on a routine possession.

996
01:01:57,691 --> 01:02:00,901
I don't have much time. They figure
out my ruse, they'll come for me.

997
01:02:01,071 --> 01:02:04,651
- What's with bringing us in here?
- You're inches from getting caught.

998
01:02:04,821 --> 01:02:08,241
Going around killing people,
about to uncase your wings.

999
01:02:08,411 --> 01:02:10,241
Don't you know what's going on?

1000
01:02:10,411 --> 01:02:12,241
Well, we're going home.

1001
01:02:12,411 --> 01:02:16,791
Really. Are you so clueless as to think
you can just waltz back into heaven?

1002
01:02:16,961 --> 01:02:19,421
- Why not?
- Everybody is looking for you.

1003
01:02:19,591 --> 01:02:22,421
Both sides. Above and below.

1004
01:02:22,591 --> 01:02:24,801
Orders are to terminate you
on sight.

1005
01:02:24,971 --> 01:02:26,261
- Really?
- Why?

1006
01:02:26,431 --> 01:02:28,511
Because you're pissing people off,
that's why.

1007
01:02:29,931 --> 01:02:32,471
Word is that God's pissed off
at your presumption...

1008
01:02:32,641 --> 01:02:35,811
...and I know Lucifer's pissed because
you might make him look bad...

1009
01:02:35,981 --> 01:02:37,811
...by succeeding where he's failed.

1010
01:02:37,981 --> 01:02:40,981
- So they're just gonna kill us?
- They're gonna try.

1011
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:43,981
That's why you have to
travel incognito.

1012
01:02:44,151 --> 01:02:47,111
Tone down your behavior.
Stay off their respective radars.

1013
01:02:47,281 --> 01:02:49,161
Quit killing people.
That's high-profile.

1014
01:02:49,321 --> 01:02:52,121
- Oh, lighten up.
- I can't believe they wanna kill us.

1015
01:02:52,291 --> 01:02:54,161
Oh, believe it, boys.

1016
01:02:55,411 --> 01:02:57,621
They've even got the last scion
looking for you.

1017
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:59,461
- Really?
- You're kidding.

1018
01:02:59,631 --> 01:03:02,501
This is huge. Your reentry
is a thorn in a lot of sides.

1019
01:03:02,671 --> 01:03:04,511
They'll stop at nothing
to prevent it.

1020
01:03:04,761 --> 01:03:07,841
Meanwhile, I suggest you find
an alternate mode of transportation.

1021
01:03:08,011 --> 01:03:10,011
If anything else comes up,
I'll contact you.

1022
01:03:10,181 --> 01:03:13,271
Thank you, Azrael.
You're a true friend.

1023
01:03:13,431 --> 01:03:16,271
I have to get back to the pit
before they get suspicious.

1024
01:03:16,441 --> 01:03:20,021
And remember, incognito.

1025
01:03:24,991 --> 01:03:27,031
How you coping, kid?

1026
01:03:27,201 --> 01:03:28,821
It's weird.

1027
01:03:28,991 --> 01:03:31,490
Just when I think
I have a handle on things...

1028
01:03:31,660 --> 01:03:34,830
...something wholly unbelievable
presents itself.

1029
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,460
Sometimes I wish
I'd just stayed home.

1030
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:40,210
You sound like the man.

1031
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:41,670
What's he like?

1032
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:44,300
He likes to listen to people talk.

1033
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:47,800
Christ loved to sit around the fire,
listen to me and the other guys.

1034
01:03:47,970 --> 01:03:50,390
Whenever we were going on
about unimportant shit...

1035
01:03:50,550 --> 01:03:52,510
...he always had a smile
on his face.

1036
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:54,640
His only real beef with mankind...

1037
01:03:54,810 --> 01:03:57,980
...is the shit that gets carried out
in his name.

1038
01:03:58,140 --> 01:04:01,440
Wars, bigotry, televangelism.

1039
01:04:01,610 --> 01:04:05,190
The big one, though,
is the factioning of all the religions.

1040
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:07,190
He said mankind got it all wrong...

1041
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:10,740
...by taking a good idea
and building a belief structure on it.

1042
01:04:10,910 --> 01:04:13,490
You're saying having beliefs
is a bad thing?

1043
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:15,660
I just think it's better
to have ideas.

1044
01:04:15,830 --> 01:04:18,870
You can change an idea.
Changing a belief is trickier.

1045
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:21,420
People die for it. People kill for it.

1046
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:23,920
The whole of existence
is in jeopardy right now...

1047
01:04:24,090 --> 01:04:29,130
...because of the Catholic beliefs
regarding this plenary-indulgence shit.

1048
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:31,590
Bartleby and Loki,
whether they know it or not...

1049
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:33,510
...are exploiting that belief...

1050
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:35,220
...and if they're successful...

1051
01:04:35,390 --> 01:04:39,310
...you, me, all of this
ends in a heartbeat.

1052
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:41,400
All over a belief.

1053
01:04:43,690 --> 01:04:47,610
I haven't seen the moron twins
in a while. How about you?

1054
01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:50,740
One time we were at the mall,
we tied Tubby to the ceiling...

1055
01:04:50,910 --> 01:04:54,240
...and he went flying through the air,
fucking crashed through the wall.

1056
01:04:54,410 --> 01:04:55,660
It was fucked up.

1057
01:04:55,830 --> 01:04:58,160
You two aren't getting into
any trouble, are you?

1058
01:04:58,330 --> 01:05:02,000
No. We're just about to smoke a fatty
with these two suave motherfuckers...

1059
01:05:02,170 --> 01:05:05,379
...who just got on at the last stop.
This is Larry and Barry.

1060
01:05:05,549 --> 01:05:06,799
- Hi.
- Hey.

1061
01:05:06,959 --> 01:05:09,469
So Jay tells us
you're gonna sleep with him.

1062
01:05:14,679 --> 01:05:17,009
Hit this shit, man. It's good stuff.

1063
01:05:18,059 --> 01:05:19,729
Oh, fuck.

1064
01:05:23,059 --> 01:05:25,439
That's some bad shit, dude.

1065
01:05:25,609 --> 01:05:27,479
You hit that?

1066
01:05:29,899 --> 01:05:31,819
Yeah, you're bad, dude.

1067
01:05:35,029 --> 01:05:36,449
Bad shit.

1068
01:05:37,489 --> 01:05:39,949
So why are you
heading to New Jersey?

1069
01:05:40,119 --> 01:05:43,459
It's just this thing I have to do.

1070
01:05:43,629 --> 01:05:44,999
We're going home.

1071
01:05:45,169 --> 01:05:47,839
Oh. Do you two live together?

1072
01:05:48,009 --> 01:05:49,799
Unfortunately, yes.

1073
01:05:52,509 --> 01:05:55,179
So how long have you two
been together?

1074
01:05:56,509 --> 01:05:58,309
A while.

1075
01:05:58,469 --> 01:06:02,099
He can be pretty flaky sometimes,
but we have a lot in common.

1076
01:06:02,519 --> 01:06:03,769
How'd you meet?

1077
01:06:03,939 --> 01:06:05,439
We were stationed together.

1078
01:06:05,609 --> 01:06:07,859
See, that's beautiful.

1079
01:06:08,029 --> 01:06:11,819
Everybody's always up in arms
about this "out in the military" issue.

1080
01:06:12,989 --> 01:06:14,029
Pardon?

1081
01:06:14,199 --> 01:06:18,369
There's all that macho bullshit
about it being "this man's army."

1082
01:06:18,539 --> 01:06:20,699
And you two meet there, hook up...

1083
01:06:21,749 --> 01:06:24,879
You think we're lovers?
No, no. We're not gay.

1084
01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:27,379
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

1085
01:06:27,549 --> 01:06:30,549
- I just assumed.
- Do I come off as gay?

1086
01:06:31,089 --> 01:06:33,299
- No.
- All right.

1087
01:06:33,469 --> 01:06:36,549
My ex-husband sort of screwed up
my relationship awareness barometer.

1088
01:06:36,719 --> 01:06:39,219
- You're divorced.
- That's a nice way of putting it.

1089
01:06:39,389 --> 01:06:40,888
I call it being dumped.

1090
01:06:41,058 --> 01:06:42,928
I was...

1091
01:06:43,098 --> 01:06:44,688
...dumped once.

1092
01:06:44,848 --> 01:06:47,688
Don't you just constantly
question your value?

1093
01:06:47,858 --> 01:06:50,398
Like, why was I so easy
to cast aside?

1094
01:06:50,568 --> 01:06:54,068
And you wonder if the other party
is gonna come to their senses...

1095
01:06:54,238 --> 01:06:55,568
...and call you back.

1096
01:06:55,738 --> 01:06:59,078
And they always tell you
it'll hurt less with time.

1097
01:06:59,238 --> 01:07:01,248
When actually...

1098
01:07:01,408 --> 01:07:03,038
...it hurts more.

1099
01:07:06,998 --> 01:07:08,668
You know what we need?

1100
01:07:08,838 --> 01:07:10,588
What do we need?

1101
01:07:10,758 --> 01:07:12,168
We need drinks.

1102
01:07:14,338 --> 01:07:15,718
We need a lot of drinks.

1103
01:07:17,388 --> 01:07:19,258
GarÃ§on.

1104
01:07:25,978 --> 01:07:27,688
You're saying you still
go to church?

1105
01:07:27,858 --> 01:07:29,938
Every Sunday.

1106
01:07:30,108 --> 01:07:32,398
Does it...? I mean, does it
do anything for you?

1107
01:07:32,568 --> 01:07:35,608
It gives me time to balance
my checkbook every week.

1108
01:07:35,778 --> 01:07:39,778
That's what I'm saying. People don't
go to church to feel spiritual anymore.

1109
01:07:39,948 --> 01:07:42,118
They go to church and feel bored...

1110
01:07:42,288 --> 01:07:45,578
...but they keep going every week
just out of habit.

1111
01:07:45,748 --> 01:07:47,958
I am so buzzed.

1112
01:07:49,628 --> 01:07:52,458
When do you think
you lost your faith?

1113
01:07:52,628 --> 01:07:54,838
I remember the exact moment.

1114
01:07:57,468 --> 01:08:01,138
I was on the phone
with my mother...

1115
01:08:01,308 --> 01:08:05,268
...and she was trying to counsel me
through this...

1116
01:08:06,398 --> 01:08:08,148
This thing.

1117
01:08:09,938 --> 01:08:14,317
And when nothing she was saying
was making me feel any better...

1118
01:08:14,487 --> 01:08:16,317
...she said:

1119
01:08:16,487 --> 01:08:18,277
"Bethany...

1120
01:08:18,447 --> 01:08:20,657
...God has a plan."

1121
01:08:23,747 --> 01:08:27,457
I was... I was so angry with her.

1122
01:08:29,537 --> 01:08:31,087
I was like:

1123
01:08:31,247 --> 01:08:33,087
"What about my plans?"

1124
01:08:33,257 --> 01:08:35,007
You know?

1125
01:08:35,167 --> 01:08:38,137
I had planned to have a family...

1126
01:08:38,297 --> 01:08:39,847
...with my husband.

1127
01:08:40,007 --> 01:08:42,927
Wasn't that plan
good enough for God?

1128
01:08:46,847 --> 01:08:48,687
Apparently not.

1129
01:08:52,067 --> 01:08:56,067
How about you?
When did you lose your faith?

1130
01:08:57,237 --> 01:08:59,407
A long time ago.

1131
01:08:59,567 --> 01:09:02,987
One day God just stopped listening.

1132
01:09:03,157 --> 01:09:04,447
I kept talking...

1133
01:09:04,617 --> 01:09:07,617
...but I got the distinct impression
he wasn't listening anymore.

1134
01:09:07,787 --> 01:09:11,037
How did you know she was listening
in the first place?

1135
01:09:14,337 --> 01:09:15,957
Well, I guess I don't.

1136
01:09:16,127 --> 01:09:19,047
I hate thoughts like that.

1137
01:09:19,467 --> 01:09:22,467
But, you know,
they come to you with age.

1138
01:09:22,637 --> 01:09:27,637
Because when you're a kid you never
question the whole faith thing.

1139
01:09:28,517 --> 01:09:31,227
God's in heaven, and he's...

1140
01:09:31,397 --> 01:09:34,777
She's always got her eye on you.

1141
01:09:39,277 --> 01:09:42,157
I'd give anything
to feel that way again.

1142
01:09:47,327 --> 01:09:50,496
Guess that's why
I got talked into this pilgrimage.

1143
01:09:58,756 --> 01:10:00,926
Where is this pilgrimage to?

1144
01:10:01,096 --> 01:10:04,176
- You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
- Try me.

1145
01:10:04,346 --> 01:10:06,596
All right, but I warned you.

1146
01:10:06,766 --> 01:10:08,346
Okay.

1147
01:10:08,516 --> 01:10:12,016
I'm going to this church
in New Jersey.

1148
01:10:12,556 --> 01:10:13,896
Really?

1149
01:10:14,066 --> 01:10:18,396
Kerwood Mandel to car three.
Kerwood Mandel to car three.

1150
01:10:18,566 --> 01:10:21,946
See, I'm supposed to stop
a couple of angels...

1151
01:10:22,116 --> 01:10:23,946
...from going into the church.

1152
01:10:25,906 --> 01:10:27,696
They're trying...

1153
01:10:27,866 --> 01:10:29,286
Shit.

1154
01:10:31,076 --> 01:10:33,836
They're trying
to get back into heaven.

1155
01:10:36,876 --> 01:10:39,416
See, they got tossed
out of heaven...

1156
01:10:39,586 --> 01:10:41,546
...years ago, right?

1157
01:10:42,086 --> 01:10:44,216
And if they get back in...

1158
01:10:44,386 --> 01:10:46,136
...it proves God wrong...

1159
01:10:46,306 --> 01:10:49,386
...and since God is infallible...

1160
01:10:49,556 --> 01:10:51,226
...to prove her wrong...

1161
01:10:51,396 --> 01:10:55,066
...would, you know,
unmake existence.

1162
01:10:56,436 --> 01:10:58,486
May I have your attention, please.

1163
01:10:58,646 --> 01:11:02,816
The dining car will be closing
in five minutes. Thank you.

1164
01:11:02,986 --> 01:11:05,486
I feel so stupid...

1165
01:11:05,656 --> 01:11:07,576
...just saying it.

1166
01:11:09,036 --> 01:11:11,326
The thing I don't get is, I mean...

1167
01:11:11,496 --> 01:11:14,076
...how am I supposed to stop
an angel?

1168
01:11:14,246 --> 01:11:15,666
Two, even!

1169
01:11:20,836 --> 01:11:24,085
I guess I'm supposed to
talk them out of it or something.

1170
01:11:24,255 --> 01:11:26,305
Maybe you're supposed to
kill them.

1171
01:11:26,465 --> 01:11:30,095
Oh, yeah, right. Kill them.

1172
01:11:30,975 --> 01:11:35,185
I mean, even if that were the case,
which it's not...

1173
01:11:36,685 --> 01:11:39,685
...how do you kill an angel, Barry?

1174
01:11:43,025 --> 01:11:46,945
I don't suppose it's much different
from killing a human.

1175
01:11:48,445 --> 01:11:50,995
Where the hell is everybody?
I wake up and...

1176
01:11:53,035 --> 01:11:54,875
- The apostle.
- Holy shit!

1177
01:11:55,035 --> 01:11:57,955
Rufus, I want you to meet
my new friend Barry.

1178
01:12:01,375 --> 01:12:03,295
Don't be such a show-off, Barry.

1179
01:12:03,465 --> 01:12:06,135
Take it easy, Bartleby.
Just let her go.

1180
01:12:06,305 --> 01:12:08,465
- We can talk about this.
- Bartleby?

1181
01:12:08,635 --> 01:12:12,135
After all this time, it comes down
to slaughter by a meat puppet?

1182
01:12:12,305 --> 01:12:15,055
Get your fucking hands off me,
you dickless son of a bitch!

1183
01:12:15,225 --> 01:12:18,065
Save it, lady. Five minutes ago
you were aching to top me off.

1184
01:12:18,225 --> 01:12:19,645
Loki!

1185
01:12:20,235 --> 01:12:21,395
Holy shit. The apostle.

1186
01:12:21,565 --> 01:12:23,565
I didn't come in you, Pete,
I swear.

1187
01:12:23,735 --> 01:12:24,855
What are you doing here?

1188
01:12:25,025 --> 01:12:27,655
This woman has to stop two angels
from entering a church.

1189
01:12:27,825 --> 01:12:29,905
- She means us?
- No, two other fucking angels.

1190
01:12:30,075 --> 01:12:33,405
I'd say there's a pretty good chance.
Rufus, we're to be liquidated?

1191
01:12:33,575 --> 01:12:36,245
You haven't thought about
the consequences of your reentry.

1192
01:12:36,415 --> 01:12:38,035
Consequences, schmonsequences.

1193
01:12:38,205 --> 01:12:41,045
We're going home, okay?
No matter whose pride it may hurt.

1194
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:43,585
- It's not a matter of pride!
- Loki, kill the girl.

1195
01:12:43,755 --> 01:12:46,425
Are you high? I can't kill her
if she hasn't done anything.

1196
01:12:46,595 --> 01:12:47,885
Fine. I'll kill her myself.

1197
01:12:48,055 --> 01:12:50,265
What, I fall asleep
and everyone takes off?

1198
01:12:50,425 --> 01:12:52,925
- These guys are fucking flat-leavers.
- Shut his mouth.

1199
01:13:03,024 --> 01:13:04,604
Oh, shit!

1200
01:13:06,234 --> 01:13:07,444
Jay!

1201
01:13:08,734 --> 01:13:09,864
Biggie!

1202
01:13:10,034 --> 01:13:12,404
The door! The door!

1203
01:13:16,284 --> 01:13:18,454
Can't we talk about this?

1204
01:13:24,044 --> 01:13:26,964
Why don't I just get off
at the next stop!

1205
01:14:07,004 --> 01:14:09,004
No ticket.

1206
01:14:11,714 --> 01:14:14,344
- The apostle is here.
- I noticed.

1207
01:14:14,514 --> 01:14:16,594
Then you know who the chick was,
don't you?

1208
01:14:16,764 --> 01:14:17,974
The scion, I imagine!

1209
01:14:18,854 --> 01:14:20,854
Maybe we should rethink
this whole thing.

1210
01:14:21,014 --> 01:14:24,104
I mean, you heard the guy.
He said there are consequences.

1211
01:14:24,274 --> 01:14:26,194
And Azrael tells us we're marked?

1212
01:14:26,354 --> 01:14:28,154
There's more to this
than we thought of.

1213
01:14:28,314 --> 01:14:30,234
I was close.

1214
01:14:30,404 --> 01:14:33,493
You know? I was so close
to slitting that bitch's throat.

1215
01:14:34,823 --> 01:14:37,993
You know how I felt? Righteous.

1216
01:14:38,163 --> 01:14:39,663
Justified. Eager, even.

1217
01:14:40,033 --> 01:14:41,793
You all right?
Your eyes are kind of...

1218
01:14:41,953 --> 01:14:44,003
My eyes are open.

1219
01:14:44,163 --> 01:14:46,003
For the first time I get it.

1220
01:14:46,173 --> 01:14:49,883
When that little innocent girl
let her mission slip, I had an epiphany.

1221
01:14:50,043 --> 01:14:53,713
See, in the beginning it was
just us and him, angels and God.

1222
01:14:53,883 --> 01:14:55,553
Then he created humans.

1223
01:14:55,723 --> 01:14:58,643
Ours was designed to be
a life of servitude and worship...

1224
01:14:58,803 --> 01:15:01,973
...and bowing and scraping
and adoration.

1225
01:15:02,143 --> 01:15:04,433
He gave them more
than he ever gave us.

1226
01:15:04,603 --> 01:15:06,483
He gave them a choice.

1227
01:15:06,643 --> 01:15:09,853
They choose to acknowledge God
or choose to ignore him.

1228
01:15:10,023 --> 01:15:11,863
All this time
we've been down here...

1229
01:15:12,023 --> 01:15:14,533
...I've felt the absence
of the divine presence...

1230
01:15:14,693 --> 01:15:17,903
...and it's pained me,
as I'm sure it must have pained you.

1231
01:15:18,073 --> 01:15:21,703
And why?
Because of the way he made us.

1232
01:15:21,873 --> 01:15:25,413
Had we been given free will, we could
choose to ignore the pain like they do.

1233
01:15:25,583 --> 01:15:27,213
But no, we're servants.

1234
01:15:27,373 --> 01:15:29,293
Okay.

1235
01:15:29,463 --> 01:15:32,883
You know, all I'm saying here is that
one of us might need a little nap.

1236
01:15:33,053 --> 01:15:34,053
Wake up!

1237
01:15:34,213 --> 01:15:36,883
Humans have besmirched
everything he's bestowed on them.

1238
01:15:37,053 --> 01:15:38,883
They were given paradise,
they threw it away.

1239
01:15:39,053 --> 01:15:41,393
They were given this planet,
they destroyed it.

1240
01:15:41,553 --> 01:15:44,013
They were favored best
among all his endeavors...

1241
01:15:44,183 --> 01:15:47,433
...and some of them
don't even believe he exists!

1242
01:15:47,603 --> 01:15:49,603
And in spite of it all...

1243
01:15:49,773 --> 01:15:53,403
...he has shown them
infinite fucking patience...

1244
01:15:53,573 --> 01:15:55,283
...at every turn.

1245
01:15:55,443 --> 01:15:56,943
What about us?

1246
01:15:58,113 --> 01:16:00,953
I asked you once...

1247
01:16:01,123 --> 01:16:03,953
...to lay down the sword
because I felt sorry for them.

1248
01:16:04,493 --> 01:16:05,873
What was the result?

1249
01:16:06,043 --> 01:16:08,212
Our expulsion from paradise.

1250
01:16:08,372 --> 01:16:10,882
Where was his
infinite fucking patience then?

1251
01:16:11,042 --> 01:16:13,792
It's not right! It's not fair!

1252
01:16:13,962 --> 01:16:15,842
We've paid our debt!

1253
01:16:17,302 --> 01:16:20,012
Don't you think it's time?

1254
01:16:20,182 --> 01:16:23,012
Don't you think it's time
we went home?

1255
01:16:24,722 --> 01:16:29,642
And to do that, I think we may have to
dispatch our would-be dispatchers.

1256
01:16:29,812 --> 01:16:32,402
Wait. Wait, wait. Kill them?

1257
01:16:33,612 --> 01:16:36,232
You're talking about the last scion,
for chrissake.

1258
01:16:36,402 --> 01:16:39,242
And what about Jay and Bob?
Those guys were all right.

1259
01:16:39,402 --> 01:16:40,862
Don't. Don't, my friend.

1260
01:16:41,032 --> 01:16:44,582
See, don't let your sympathies
get the best of you.

1261
01:16:44,742 --> 01:16:46,162
They did me once.

1262
01:16:46,332 --> 01:16:48,122
Scion or not...

1263
01:16:48,292 --> 01:16:49,622
...she's just a human...

1264
01:16:49,792 --> 01:16:52,832
...and by passing through that arch
our sins are forgiven.

1265
01:16:53,002 --> 01:16:55,002
No harm, no foul.

1266
01:16:56,172 --> 01:16:59,012
My God.
I've heard a rant like this before.

1267
01:17:00,632 --> 01:17:01,932
What did you say?

1268
01:17:02,092 --> 01:17:05,102
- I've heard a rant like this before.
- Don't you do that to me.

1269
01:17:05,262 --> 01:17:08,182
- You sound like the morning star.
- You shut your fucking mouth!

1270
01:17:08,352 --> 01:17:11,352
You sound like Lucifer, man!
You've fucking lost it!

1271
01:17:11,522 --> 01:17:14,022
You're not talking about
going home, Bartleby.

1272
01:17:14,192 --> 01:17:16,692
You're talking about
fucking war on God.

1273
01:17:18,152 --> 01:17:19,692
Well, fuck that.

1274
01:17:19,862 --> 01:17:24,122
I have seen what happens to the proud
when they take on the throne.

1275
01:17:25,662 --> 01:17:27,202
I'm going back to Wisconsin.

1276
01:17:28,702 --> 01:17:30,502
We're going home, Loki...

1277
01:17:30,672 --> 01:17:34,632
...and no one, not you,
not even the Almighty himself...

1278
01:17:34,792 --> 01:17:36,632
...is gonna make that otherwise.

1279
01:17:43,221 --> 01:17:44,641
Shit.

1280
01:17:45,851 --> 01:17:49,391
Why couldn't we stay on the train?
You threw those guys off.

1281
01:17:49,561 --> 01:17:51,231
Very basic strategy.

1282
01:17:51,391 --> 01:17:54,731
If your enemies know where you are,
then don't be there.

1283
01:17:54,901 --> 01:17:55,901
Why are we enemies?

1284
01:17:56,071 --> 01:17:59,361
Well, I know I'd perceive the person
sent to kill me as an enemy.

1285
01:17:59,531 --> 01:18:02,821
What does that mean? Since when
am I supposed to kill anybody?

1286
01:18:02,991 --> 01:18:06,581
I'm tired of
all this cryptic bullshit.

1287
01:18:06,741 --> 01:18:09,241
I'm physically and psychologically
exhausted, Rufus...

1288
01:18:09,411 --> 01:18:12,541
...and I'm ready to kick back
and welcome the end of existence...

1289
01:18:12,711 --> 01:18:15,001
...unless you come clean right now.

1290
01:18:15,171 --> 01:18:17,171
Why me?

1291
01:18:17,341 --> 01:18:20,761
Out of all the people on the
goddamn planet, why was I tapped?

1292
01:18:20,921 --> 01:18:24,141
Imagine you're a 12-year-old boy.

1293
01:18:25,051 --> 01:18:29,021
You're told you're God's only son,
but more than that, you're God.

1294
01:18:29,181 --> 01:18:32,691
How long would it take to come
to grips with something that huge?

1295
01:18:32,851 --> 01:18:35,441
Maybe, say, 18 years?

1296
01:18:35,611 --> 01:18:40,611
In the Bible, Jesus suddenly goes
from age 12 to 30. Twelve to 30.

1297
01:18:40,781 --> 01:18:42,901
Now, that's some pretty bad
storytelling.

1298
01:18:43,071 --> 01:18:45,911
Where are the volumes of text
dealing with the missing 18 years?

1299
01:18:46,071 --> 01:18:47,281
I'll tell you where.

1300
01:18:47,451 --> 01:18:52,121
They were offered up as a sacrifice
to the god of ecumenical politics.

1301
01:18:52,291 --> 01:18:55,211
You make it sound like
there's some church conspiracy...

1302
01:18:55,381 --> 01:18:58,041
...to cover up
"the truth about Christ."

1303
01:19:00,461 --> 01:19:01,801
Oh, bullshit.

1304
01:19:01,971 --> 01:19:03,881
Any important material
about Christ...

1305
01:19:04,051 --> 01:19:06,551
...would give people
a better understanding of God.

1306
01:19:06,721 --> 01:19:10,641
- Why would they leave any of it out?
- Because it's tied in with his family.

1307
01:19:10,811 --> 01:19:13,771
- His mother and father.
- His brothers and sisters.

1308
01:19:13,941 --> 01:19:18,110
Jesus didn't have brothers and sisters.
Mary was a virgin.

1309
01:19:18,270 --> 01:19:22,530
Mary gave birth to Christ without
knowing a man's touch. This is true.

1310
01:19:22,690 --> 01:19:24,530
But she did have a husband.

1311
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:28,320
Do you really think he would've stayed
married to her for all those years...

1312
01:19:28,490 --> 01:19:29,990
...if he wasn't getting laid?

1313
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:33,500
The nature of God and the virgin birth,
those are leaps of faith.

1314
01:19:33,660 --> 01:19:37,830
But to believe a married couple never
got down, that's just plain gullibility.

1315
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Meaning?

1316
01:19:39,170 --> 01:19:41,000
The blood that flows
through your veins...

1317
01:19:41,170 --> 01:19:43,800
...shares a chromosome or two
at the genetic level...

1318
01:19:43,970 --> 01:19:45,630
...with the one you call Jesus.

1319
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:48,600
Bethany, you are...

1320
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:52,060
...the great-great-great-great-
great-great-great-great...

1321
01:19:52,230 --> 01:19:55,690
...great-great-grandniece
of Jesus Christ.

1322
01:19:59,650 --> 01:20:03,610
So that would make Bethany
part black?

1323
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:10,330
I can't do this anymore.

1324
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:18,710
Bethany, where you gonna go?
You know what I'm saying is right.

1325
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:20,540
- It's bullshit.
- Bethany.

1326
01:20:20,710 --> 01:20:22,500
It's bullshit!

1327
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:28,260
Let her go, man.

1328
01:20:28,430 --> 01:20:29,850
Give her time.

1329
01:20:37,230 --> 01:20:39,190
Why?!

1330
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:42,190
What the fuck do you want
from me?

1331
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:44,650
I fucking hate you!

1332
01:20:45,650 --> 01:20:47,240
I hate you.

1333
01:20:47,410 --> 01:20:49,570
He can't hear you, you know.

1334
01:20:55,409 --> 01:20:57,419
That's why we needed you.

1335
01:20:57,579 --> 01:20:59,749
Why didn't you tell me?

1336
01:20:59,919 --> 01:21:01,539
Would you...?

1337
01:21:02,129 --> 01:21:04,379
Could you have believed me?

1338
01:21:05,219 --> 01:21:07,679
It was something
you had to come to gradually.

1339
01:21:08,639 --> 01:21:11,389
Only after everything you've seen...

1340
01:21:11,929 --> 01:21:13,179
...everything you've heard...

1341
01:21:15,179 --> 01:21:18,229
...could you possibly be able
to accept the truth.

1342
01:21:18,769 --> 01:21:20,899
I don't want this.

1343
01:21:23,609 --> 01:21:25,609
It's too big.

1344
01:21:25,779 --> 01:21:27,359
That's what Jesus said.

1345
01:21:29,619 --> 01:21:31,529
I had to tell him.

1346
01:21:34,749 --> 01:21:37,789
You can imagine
how that hurt the Father...

1347
01:21:38,829 --> 01:21:41,129
...not to be able
to tell the son himself...

1348
01:21:41,289 --> 01:21:44,299
...because one word from his lips
would destroy the boy's human form.

1349
01:21:44,459 --> 01:21:47,469
So I had to deliver the news
to a scared child...

1350
01:21:47,629 --> 01:21:50,259
...who wanted nothing more
than to play with other children.

1351
01:21:50,429 --> 01:21:54,139
I had to tell this little boy
that he was God's only son...

1352
01:21:54,309 --> 01:21:57,139
...and it meant a life of persecution
and eventual crucifixion...

1353
01:21:57,309 --> 01:22:00,439
...at the hands of the very people
he'd come to enlighten and redeem.

1354
01:22:02,689 --> 01:22:04,859
He begged me to take it all back.

1355
01:22:06,279 --> 01:22:07,819
As if I could.

1356
01:22:09,569 --> 01:22:12,319
He begged me to
"make it all not true."

1357
01:22:12,489 --> 01:22:16,829
I'll let you in on something, Bethany,
it's something I've never told anyone.

1358
01:22:18,749 --> 01:22:20,829
If I had the power...

1359
01:22:21,709 --> 01:22:23,089
...I would have.

1360
01:22:23,879 --> 01:22:24,998
It's unfair.

1361
01:22:25,508 --> 01:22:28,758
It's unfair to ask a child
to shoulder that responsibility...

1362
01:22:28,928 --> 01:22:31,138
...and to ask you
to do the same now.

1363
01:22:31,298 --> 01:22:35,058
I sympathize. I do.
I wish I could take it all back.

1364
01:22:37,978 --> 01:22:39,558
But I can't.

1365
01:22:42,438 --> 01:22:43,858
This...

1366
01:22:45,108 --> 01:22:47,188
...is who you are.

1367
01:22:49,108 --> 01:22:51,658
Everything I am has been a lie?

1368
01:22:53,158 --> 01:22:55,028
No, no, no.

1369
01:22:55,738 --> 01:23:00,288
Knowing what you now know doesn't
mean you're not who you were.

1370
01:23:00,458 --> 01:23:03,168
You are Bethany Sloane.

1371
01:23:03,328 --> 01:23:06,748
No one can take that away from you,
not even God.

1372
01:23:08,088 --> 01:23:12,758
All this means is
a redefinition of that identity.

1373
01:23:12,928 --> 01:23:16,468
The incorporation of this new data
into who you are.

1374
01:23:16,638 --> 01:23:18,718
Be who you've always been.

1375
01:23:19,808 --> 01:23:20,978
Just...

1376
01:23:21,978 --> 01:23:24,018
...be this as well...

1377
01:23:25,358 --> 01:23:27,818
...from time to time.

1378
01:23:31,778 --> 01:23:34,318
Guess this means
no more cheating on my taxes.

1379
01:23:34,488 --> 01:23:36,658
To say the least.

1380
01:23:44,878 --> 01:23:47,378
Do you mind if we adjourn
to somewhere...

1381
01:23:47,548 --> 01:23:50,088
...a tad more habitable...

1382
01:23:50,258 --> 01:23:52,218
...and a bit warmer?

1383
01:24:06,647 --> 01:24:09,277
Fuck, man, I think this shit
Just kicked in.

1384
01:24:09,437 --> 01:24:12,237
Weren't we just in the woods?
What are we doing here now?

1385
01:24:12,397 --> 01:24:14,277
Going out in style.

1386
01:24:14,447 --> 01:24:16,947
- The voice.
- The apostle.

1387
01:24:17,117 --> 01:24:18,867
Now, who's this motherfucker?

1388
01:24:19,037 --> 01:24:21,117
It's the voice of God.
Show some respect.

1389
01:24:21,287 --> 01:24:23,617
Oh, the voice of God.
Where's the rest of him?

1390
01:24:23,787 --> 01:24:25,957
Funny you should mention that.
We're not sure.

1391
01:24:26,127 --> 01:24:28,797
- What?
- Come on. Didn't it ever occur to you...

1392
01:24:28,957 --> 01:24:32,917
...that this Bartleby-Loki situation was
well within the sphere of his control?

1393
01:24:33,087 --> 01:24:34,757
Yes, but then why was she tapped?

1394
01:24:34,927 --> 01:24:38,807
You know those constitutionals
that he likes to take?

1395
01:24:38,967 --> 01:24:40,137
"Constitutionals"?

1396
01:24:40,307 --> 01:24:42,727
I think we're beyond euphemisms
at this point.

1397
01:24:42,887 --> 01:24:44,727
God's a skeeball fanatic.

1398
01:24:46,107 --> 01:24:49,067
The Lord has a fancy for the game.
He's been playing it for years.

1399
01:24:49,227 --> 01:24:51,817
He assumes a human form
once a month and indulges.

1400
01:24:51,987 --> 01:24:54,907
Doesn't say where he's playing,
just goes away for a couple hours.

1401
01:24:55,067 --> 01:24:58,487
And he always gives his free points
away to neighborhood children.

1402
01:24:58,657 --> 01:24:59,987
Isn't that sweet?

1403
01:25:00,157 --> 01:25:03,657
But she hasn't come back from
one of these day trips, is that it?

1404
01:25:03,827 --> 01:25:06,127
No, she hasn't...

1405
01:25:06,287 --> 01:25:08,997
...and we've been
unable to locate her.

1406
01:25:09,167 --> 01:25:12,417
He could've been killed.
Human form does have that drawback.

1407
01:25:12,587 --> 01:25:16,837
No, there's a different sort
of foul play afoot, children.

1408
01:25:17,547 --> 01:25:21,017
Whomever has set
the renegade angels on their path...

1409
01:25:21,177 --> 01:25:23,517
...and is keeping them
quite well hidden...

1410
01:25:23,687 --> 01:25:26,557
...is also responsible
for the Lord's whereabouts.

1411
01:25:26,727 --> 01:25:28,897
Were he to be killed
in human form...

1412
01:25:29,067 --> 01:25:31,647
...he'd have returned
immediately to heaven.

1413
01:25:31,817 --> 01:25:33,686
Someone knew enough...

1414
01:25:33,856 --> 01:25:35,896
...to keep him biologically alive...

1415
01:25:36,066 --> 01:25:38,946
...but incapacitate him
in another fashion.

1416
01:25:39,116 --> 01:25:41,786
And as omnipotent
as we are above...

1417
01:25:41,946 --> 01:25:45,326
...I have to admit that we're
more or less lost without his presence.

1418
01:25:45,496 --> 01:25:47,326
We've looked everywhere for him.

1419
01:25:47,496 --> 01:25:52,246
I tapped her because I thought we'd be
able to smoke out whoever's behind it.

1420
01:25:52,416 --> 01:25:55,626
But whoever he is was clever enough
to send some lackeys after you...

1421
01:25:55,796 --> 01:25:57,796
...as opposed to showing up
themselves.

1422
01:25:57,966 --> 01:25:59,636
Could it be Lucifer?

1423
01:25:59,806 --> 01:26:01,096
Not Lucifer.

1424
01:26:01,266 --> 01:26:04,726
If he was, he'd have made
his move by now to conquer Heaven.

1425
01:26:04,886 --> 01:26:07,726
And I know he's not responsible
for Bartleby and Loki...

1426
01:26:07,896 --> 01:26:11,016
...because he has just as much to lose
by their return as anybody else.

1427
01:26:11,186 --> 01:26:12,566
So, what do we do now?

1428
01:26:12,736 --> 01:26:15,486
Well, I say we get drunk,
because I'm all out of ideas.

1429
01:26:15,656 --> 01:26:18,526
Why don't we just ask this guy
to close the church?

1430
01:26:19,196 --> 01:26:20,406
I beg your pardon?

1431
01:26:20,576 --> 01:26:22,486
It's the guy in charge
of the church thing.

1432
01:26:25,366 --> 01:26:27,166
Cardinal Glick?

1433
01:26:27,326 --> 01:26:29,416
Maybe we can ask him
to shut down the church.

1434
01:26:29,586 --> 01:26:32,836
If it's closed that day, those guys
can't get blessed or whatever, right?

1435
01:26:33,006 --> 01:26:34,206
Good Lord.

1436
01:26:34,376 --> 01:26:36,336
The little stoner's got a point.

1437
01:26:36,506 --> 01:26:41,006
Maybe we could talk this guy Glick into
canceling the rededication ceremony.

1438
01:26:41,176 --> 01:26:43,096
"We"?

1439
01:26:43,266 --> 01:26:46,266
Are you saying you're back in,
Ms. I Can't Do This Anymore?

1440
01:26:51,396 --> 01:26:53,936
I wouldn't want to let the family down,
now, would I?

1441
01:26:57,106 --> 01:26:58,906
Well...

1442
01:26:59,066 --> 01:27:02,776
...the prophets finally
live up to their titles.

1443
01:27:03,326 --> 01:27:06,036
Mass attendance is at
an all-time low in this country...

1444
01:27:06,206 --> 01:27:10,625
...but if we can let them know the
Catholic Church has a little panache...

1445
01:27:10,785 --> 01:27:13,745
...we can win them back,
even get some new ones.

1446
01:27:14,085 --> 01:27:15,415
Excuse me.

1447
01:27:17,545 --> 01:27:19,085
Fill them pews, people.

1448
01:27:19,255 --> 01:27:22,095
That's the key.
Grab the little ones as well.

1449
01:27:22,255 --> 01:27:24,635
Hook them while they're young.

1450
01:27:24,805 --> 01:27:28,885
- Kind of like the tobacco industry.
- Christ, if only we had their numbers.

1451
01:27:29,055 --> 01:27:32,105
We really appreciate you seeing us
so late in the day, Your Eminence.

1452
01:27:32,265 --> 01:27:35,775
My friends and I have been traveling
all night in hope of talking to you...

1453
01:27:35,935 --> 01:27:38,315
...about the St. Michael's
rededication ceremony.

1454
01:27:38,485 --> 01:27:40,905
So you looking to help out
in some way, I take it?

1455
01:27:41,065 --> 01:27:43,775
We'd like you to cancel
the ceremony.

1456
01:27:44,905 --> 01:27:46,495
I beg your pardon.

1457
01:27:46,655 --> 01:27:50,575
There's gonna be a world of trouble
if tomorrow's ceremony goes forward.

1458
01:27:51,705 --> 01:27:54,495
Are you pro-choice?

1459
01:27:54,665 --> 01:27:56,165
No, no. The trouble's not from us.

1460
01:27:56,335 --> 01:27:59,585
It's from renegade angels that have
been stuck on Earth since the plagues.

1461
01:28:02,385 --> 01:28:04,845
These guys,
they think they're renegade angels.

1462
01:28:05,015 --> 01:28:07,135
See, padre, it goes down like this.

1463
01:28:07,305 --> 01:28:09,935
These guys think that
by passing through that archway...

1464
01:28:10,095 --> 01:28:11,935
...they can go straight to heaven.

1465
01:28:12,105 --> 01:28:15,645
You want me to call off
the ceremony for that.

1466
01:28:16,775 --> 01:28:17,855
Who sent you?

1467
01:28:20,025 --> 01:28:22,985
We were sent
by him who is called I Am!

1468
01:28:23,155 --> 01:28:25,655
Cute. Really cute.

1469
01:28:25,825 --> 01:28:28,115
Kids, playtime with the cardinal
is over.

1470
01:28:28,285 --> 01:28:30,825
- Worked for Moses.
- Stay out of this.

1471
01:28:30,995 --> 01:28:32,535
Your Eminence, it's not a joke.

1472
01:28:32,705 --> 01:28:35,705
I'm telling you, man,
this ceremony's a big mistake.

1473
01:28:35,875 --> 01:28:38,715
The Catholic Church
does not make mistakes.

1474
01:28:38,875 --> 01:28:41,755
Please! What about the Church's
silent consent of the slave trade?

1475
01:28:41,925 --> 01:28:44,384
And its platform of noninvolvement
during the Holocaust?

1476
01:28:44,554 --> 01:28:46,884
All right, mistakes were made.

1477
01:28:47,054 --> 01:28:50,184
But one can hardly hold the current
incarnation of Holy Mother Church...

1478
01:28:50,344 --> 01:28:52,144
...responsible for
the oversights of old.

1479
01:28:52,304 --> 01:28:55,974
I'm an important man with important
matters that demand my attention...

1480
01:28:56,144 --> 01:28:57,564
...so if you please...

1481
01:28:57,734 --> 01:29:00,394
- But tomorrow...
- Tomorrow goes off without a hitch.

1482
01:29:00,564 --> 01:29:01,814
Do I make myself clear?

1483
01:29:01,984 --> 01:29:06,574
Neither you nor any other influence
short of the hand of God himself...

1484
01:29:06,734 --> 01:29:09,574
...is gonna keep this thing
from going off without a hitch.

1485
01:29:30,594 --> 01:29:32,594
I can see the headlines now...

1486
01:29:33,014 --> 01:29:34,594
...if there were gonna be any.

1487
01:29:34,764 --> 01:29:36,264
"Existence Erased."

1488
01:29:36,434 --> 01:29:38,604
Don't worry about it.
We evened the score.

1489
01:29:38,774 --> 01:29:41,024
Hand it over, Silent Bob.

1490
01:29:43,614 --> 01:29:44,694
What up?

1491
01:29:44,864 --> 01:29:47,024
You stole the cardinal's driver?

1492
01:29:47,194 --> 01:29:51,114
That's what he gets for messing with
our girlfriend. Cross-dressing fuck.

1493
01:29:51,284 --> 01:29:53,994
That's sort of sweet.
Thanks, guys.

1494
01:29:55,454 --> 01:29:58,294
What do we do now
about Bartleby and Loki?

1495
01:29:58,454 --> 01:30:01,584
I guess we're gonna
have to try and kill them.

1496
01:30:01,754 --> 01:30:03,794
- You said they couldn't be killed.
- Correction.

1497
01:30:05,464 --> 01:30:08,134
They won't be killed.

1498
01:30:08,304 --> 01:30:11,264
And just to ensure that,
we're all gonna sit tight...

1499
01:30:11,434 --> 01:30:15,684
...right here, until those two idiots
pass through that arch.

1500
01:30:15,854 --> 01:30:19,473
Hey. There's only
one idiot here, Azrael...

1501
01:30:22,273 --> 01:30:24,353
...and I'm looking right at him.

1502
01:30:24,523 --> 01:30:25,983
Muse!

1503
01:30:27,363 --> 01:30:30,443
Just in time to join us for a drink.

1504
01:30:30,613 --> 01:30:32,993
Hey. Where'd you come from?

1505
01:30:34,953 --> 01:30:36,783
- Where'd you come from?
- Me?

1506
01:30:36,953 --> 01:30:38,373
Nothingness.

1507
01:30:38,543 --> 01:30:42,163
And that's where I'm returning to
in approximately, oh, one hour.

1508
01:30:42,333 --> 01:30:45,833
All right, Plato, sounds like
you've had enough already.

1509
01:30:46,003 --> 01:30:48,383
- Let's go.
- Oh, darn it!

1510
01:30:48,553 --> 01:30:52,133
Come on, barkeep, just one drink.
One for the road, then I'm gone?

1511
01:30:52,303 --> 01:30:55,553
I was trying to find you to tell you
I figured out who was behind all this.

1512
01:30:55,723 --> 01:30:57,143
Is that who I think it is?

1513
01:30:57,313 --> 01:30:58,513
- None other than.
- Who is he?

1514
01:30:58,683 --> 01:31:01,353
All right, one drink.
Then you're gone.

1515
01:31:01,523 --> 01:31:03,603
Give me a...

1516
01:31:03,773 --> 01:31:06,153
...Holy Bartender.

1517
01:31:06,313 --> 01:31:08,113
Never heard of it.

1518
01:31:08,273 --> 01:31:12,033
He doesn't know how to make
a Holy Bartender.

1519
01:31:12,203 --> 01:31:14,033
You do, don't you, Muse?

1520
01:31:14,203 --> 01:31:15,203
Don't.

1521
01:31:16,373 --> 01:31:19,033
Anybody? No?

1522
01:31:19,453 --> 01:31:22,623
Well, I know how to make
a Holy Bartender.

1523
01:31:31,263 --> 01:31:32,303
Get it?

1524
01:31:32,473 --> 01:31:34,633
Sweet Jesus, Azrael! Why?

1525
01:31:34,803 --> 01:31:38,223
Come on, demon! Try that shit
on somebody who's already dead!

1526
01:31:38,393 --> 01:31:41,723
Oh, apostle, you maintain
that kind of an attitude...

1527
01:31:41,893 --> 01:31:44,853
...and you and the barkeep won't be
the only corpses in the room.

1528
01:31:45,023 --> 01:31:47,063
The Christ bitch will join you.

1529
01:31:47,863 --> 01:31:50,323
Are you really that stupid?

1530
01:31:50,483 --> 01:31:53,902
You do know what's gonna happen
if those two jerks enter that church.

1531
01:31:54,072 --> 01:31:56,362
I'm actually counting on it.

1532
01:31:57,662 --> 01:31:59,742
And if my calculations
are correct...

1533
01:31:59,912 --> 01:32:02,582
...the pawns are moving
into checkmate as we speak.

1534
01:32:07,582 --> 01:32:11,092
"Holy Bartender." I get it.
That's a great one!

1535
01:32:11,262 --> 01:32:15,382
I'd also like to acknowledge this great
state's governor, Elizabeth Dalton...

1536
01:32:15,552 --> 01:32:17,092
...for coming here this morning.

1537
01:32:17,262 --> 01:32:20,262
True, she's a Protestant, but we're
not gonna hold that against her.

1538
01:32:22,312 --> 01:32:26,602
Now, let me just tell you a little bit
of history about this particular...

1539
01:32:26,772 --> 01:32:29,362
...hundred-years-young
house of God.

1540
01:32:29,522 --> 01:32:30,732
God's house?

1541
01:32:32,192 --> 01:32:34,822
God doesn't live here anymore.

1542
01:32:34,992 --> 01:32:37,702
He's grown weary
of your superficial faith.

1543
01:32:37,872 --> 01:32:40,702
He's turned a deaf ear
to your lip-service prayers.

1544
01:32:40,872 --> 01:32:43,122
- He has abandoned you...
- Sorry.

1545
01:32:43,292 --> 01:32:46,122
...his favorites,
to the whim of judgment.

1546
01:32:46,292 --> 01:32:48,712
Hypocrites, charlatans...

1547
01:32:50,462 --> 01:32:52,962
...prepare to taste God's wrath.

1548
01:32:53,132 --> 01:32:54,342
Maybe we should just leave.

1549
01:32:54,512 --> 01:32:56,172
You wanted your body count.
You got it.

1550
01:32:56,342 --> 01:32:58,722
This lot is rife with sin.
We'll judge them all.

1551
01:32:58,892 --> 01:33:00,052
Officer McGhee.

1552
01:33:00,932 --> 01:33:02,642
All right, mouthpiece...

1553
01:33:02,812 --> 01:33:05,482
...let's leave the nice cardinal alone
and go for a ride.

1554
01:33:05,642 --> 01:33:07,982
Mr. McGhee, don't make me angry.

1555
01:33:08,152 --> 01:33:09,982
You wouldn't like me
when I'm angry.

1556
01:33:10,152 --> 01:33:11,902
Is that so?

1557
01:33:16,282 --> 01:33:17,952
Ladies and gentlemen...

1558
01:33:18,112 --> 01:33:23,492
...you have been judged as guilty of
violations against our Almighty God...

1559
01:33:23,662 --> 01:33:26,001
...and this very day...

1560
01:33:26,161 --> 01:33:29,831
...I assure you, you will all
pay for your trespasses...

1561
01:33:30,001 --> 01:33:31,671
...in blood.

1562
01:33:31,841 --> 01:33:34,001
- Wings. Now.
- I'm feeling a little exposed here.

1563
01:33:34,171 --> 01:33:35,171
Do it!

1564
01:33:36,471 --> 01:33:39,091
- So he's a muse too?
- Former muse.

1565
01:33:40,851 --> 01:33:44,181
He was kicked out.

1566
01:33:44,351 --> 01:33:46,681
Ever the fucking apple polisher.

1567
01:33:46,851 --> 01:33:47,851
Then what happened?

1568
01:33:48,021 --> 01:33:50,101
Yes, what?

1569
01:33:50,271 --> 01:33:54,151
Well, Lucifer just had to start
his little war for the throne.

1570
01:33:54,321 --> 01:33:56,781
Heaven became divided
into two factions...

1571
01:33:56,951 --> 01:33:59,031
...the faithful and the renegades.

1572
01:33:59,201 --> 01:34:01,951
Oh, the ethereal plains
were chaotic with battle.

1573
01:34:02,121 --> 01:34:04,831
Angel against angel.

1574
01:34:04,991 --> 01:34:08,331
And when it was all over,
God cast the rebels into perdition.

1575
01:34:08,501 --> 01:34:10,291
But Azrael refused to fight.

1576
01:34:10,461 --> 01:34:13,881
He remained in the middle, waiting
to see who came out victorious.

1577
01:34:14,051 --> 01:34:16,051
What are you,
some kind of fucking chicken?

1578
01:34:16,211 --> 01:34:17,551
No.

1579
01:34:17,721 --> 01:34:21,551
I was an artist, stupid!

1580
01:34:21,721 --> 01:34:23,261
I was inspiration!

1581
01:34:23,431 --> 01:34:25,851
A muse has no place in battle.

1582
01:34:26,021 --> 01:34:28,481
So after the fallen
were banished to hell...

1583
01:34:28,641 --> 01:34:30,641
...God turned on those
that wouldn't fight...

1584
01:34:30,811 --> 01:34:33,061
...and Azrael was sent down
with the demons...

1585
01:34:33,231 --> 01:34:35,941
...something he considers
a great injustice.

1586
01:34:36,111 --> 01:34:38,191
Oh, come on.

1587
01:34:38,361 --> 01:34:41,321
Don't tell me you never questioned
the judgment, Serendipity.

1588
01:34:41,491 --> 01:34:44,161
No. It never bothered me.

1589
01:34:44,331 --> 01:34:46,241
So you were an artist.

1590
01:34:46,411 --> 01:34:48,081
Big deal!

1591
01:34:48,251 --> 01:34:50,251
Elvis was an artist...

1592
01:34:50,421 --> 01:34:53,671
...but that didn't stop him from
joining the service in time of war.

1593
01:34:53,841 --> 01:34:55,671
That's why he is the king...

1594
01:34:55,841 --> 01:34:57,671
...and you're a schmuck.

1595
01:34:57,841 --> 01:34:58,921
Nice.

1596
01:34:59,091 --> 01:35:00,880
So all this is about revenge.

1597
01:35:01,050 --> 01:35:03,930
You're gonna unmake existence
because of a grudge against God?

1598
01:35:04,100 --> 01:35:07,770
After the first million years? No.

1599
01:35:07,930 --> 01:35:11,690
Escape from hell
became my all-consuming reason.

1600
01:35:11,850 --> 01:35:16,270
So I studied the religions and waited
for my opportunity to present itself...

1601
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:17,860
...which it finally did...

1602
01:35:18,030 --> 01:35:19,900
...in Catholicism.

1603
01:35:20,070 --> 01:35:21,240
Plenary indulgence.

1604
01:35:21,410 --> 01:35:23,200
But I couldn't exercise it.

1605
01:35:23,370 --> 01:35:25,740
Demons can't become human.

1606
01:35:25,910 --> 01:35:27,950
No, we can't transubstantiate.

1607
01:35:29,540 --> 01:35:30,910
But angels can.

1608
01:35:32,250 --> 01:35:33,460
Bartleby and Loki.

1609
01:35:35,290 --> 01:35:38,210
After that it was a simple matter
of waiting for a church...

1610
01:35:38,380 --> 01:35:40,090
...to celebrate their centennial...

1611
01:35:40,260 --> 01:35:45,800
...and when it finally happened I sent
the pair an article laced with ideas.

1612
01:35:45,970 --> 01:35:47,810
An incantation
I picked up in the pit...

1613
01:35:47,970 --> 01:35:49,970
...kept them cloaked
and off heaven's radars.

1614
01:35:50,140 --> 01:35:53,230
And aside from the triplets here
and the Golgothan...

1615
01:35:53,400 --> 01:35:57,110
...no soul in hell had a clue
as to what was going on.

1616
01:35:57,280 --> 01:36:00,150
But the Almighty
could still putsch the whole deal...

1617
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:03,740
...so I dispatched him
in a fairly ingenious fashion.

1618
01:36:03,910 --> 01:36:06,240
Her. And how?

1619
01:36:06,410 --> 01:36:08,910
That's the only thing
I couldn't figure out.

1620
01:36:09,080 --> 01:36:11,910
Oh, no, I've seen way too many
Bond movies to know...

1621
01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:14,920
...that you never reveal
all the details of your plan...

1622
01:36:15,090 --> 01:36:18,420
...no matter how close
you may think you are to winning.

1623
01:36:18,590 --> 01:36:21,670
The only X factor was the involvement
of the last scion here.

1624
01:36:22,510 --> 01:36:27,140
But fat lot of good that did, right?
I mean, here you all are.

1625
01:36:29,980 --> 01:36:33,100
Powerless to stop the inevitable.

1626
01:36:33,270 --> 01:36:37,269
Look, asshole, I don't know
if anyone explained the rules to you...

1627
01:36:37,439 --> 01:36:41,279
...but if you succeed everything gets
blinked out of existence, even you.

1628
01:36:41,439 --> 01:36:44,319
Human, have you ever
been to hell?

1629
01:36:44,489 --> 01:36:46,529
I think not.

1630
01:36:46,699 --> 01:36:48,869
I'd rather not exist
than go back to that.

1631
01:36:49,039 --> 01:36:53,329
And if everyone has to
go down with me, so be it.

1632
01:36:53,499 --> 01:36:55,869
Still thinking only about yourself...

1633
01:36:56,039 --> 01:36:57,879
...you fucking child!

1634
01:36:58,039 --> 01:37:00,129
Now, now, now.

1635
01:37:01,009 --> 01:37:04,009
Things are getting
too intense in here.

1636
01:37:04,179 --> 01:37:06,639
Hey! What say
we watch a little TV?

1637
01:37:06,799 --> 01:37:08,719
Yo, put on Channel 9.
Davey and Goliath.

1638
01:37:10,179 --> 01:37:14,479
Actually, I was thinking more
along the lines of current events.

1639
01:37:14,649 --> 01:37:16,979
Keep rolling! Keep rolling!

1640
01:37:17,149 --> 01:37:19,899
I repeat,
men with huge fucking wings...

1641
01:37:20,069 --> 01:37:22,109
...have laid waste to St. Michael's!

1642
01:37:22,279 --> 01:37:24,609
Bullets don't seem to affect them!

1643
01:37:25,409 --> 01:37:28,279
The remainder of the crowd
have dropped to their knees...

1644
01:37:28,449 --> 01:37:30,739
...identifying this
as the fabled apocalypse.

1645
01:37:30,909 --> 01:37:33,709
Now, I'm not a man of faith,
but I'm inclined to agree.

1646
01:37:33,869 --> 01:37:37,999
God, please, don't come any closer!
Don't come any closer! God, no!

1647
01:37:38,249 --> 01:37:39,839
No!

1648
01:37:46,089 --> 01:37:49,259
You see that?
And I told them to keep a low profile.

1649
01:37:49,429 --> 01:37:52,929
I'd be pissed, but in a couple minutes
it's not gonna matter anyway.

1650
01:37:59,689 --> 01:38:02,029
Oh, now what was that
all about?

1651
01:38:02,189 --> 01:38:03,689
What?

1652
01:38:03,859 --> 01:38:06,279
Oh, nothing.

1653
01:38:06,449 --> 01:38:08,529
I had something in my eye.

1654
01:38:08,699 --> 01:38:11,368
Now who's the fucking child?

1655
01:38:12,578 --> 01:38:15,748
What did you tell him,
to hit me with the golf club?

1656
01:38:16,458 --> 01:38:18,168
Are you serious?
I'm a fucking demon.

1657
01:38:18,328 --> 01:38:20,088
You'd have him assault me
with a putter?

1658
01:38:21,208 --> 01:38:23,208
You want to play? Then we'll play.

1659
01:38:23,378 --> 01:38:25,088
One side, Red.

1660
01:38:25,838 --> 01:38:28,758
Go ahead, then. Pick it up.
Call it a gift.

1661
01:38:30,258 --> 01:38:32,178
Come on.

1662
01:38:32,348 --> 01:38:33,768
That's it.

1663
01:38:35,558 --> 01:38:36,808
Take a shot.

1664
01:38:36,978 --> 01:38:40,478
Take your best fucking shot.

1665
01:38:42,028 --> 01:38:44,988
Seriously. I'm not kidding.
Take it. Come on.

1666
01:38:45,608 --> 01:38:47,858
Come on, bright boy.

1667
01:38:55,708 --> 01:38:58,118
Don't you know anything?

1668
01:39:13,638 --> 01:39:15,518
Bethany, bless the sink!

1669
01:39:15,678 --> 01:39:17,478
- What?
- Just do it!

1670
01:39:17,638 --> 01:39:19,518
Bless the sink, damn it!

1671
01:39:43,877 --> 01:39:46,007
That's what you get, motherfucker.

1672
01:39:48,627 --> 01:39:50,717
But I'm a fucking demon.

1673
01:39:58,057 --> 01:39:59,307
What just happened?

1674
01:39:59,477 --> 01:40:02,017
He said it himself:
"I'm a fucking demon."

1675
01:40:02,187 --> 01:40:06,487
Hit a demon with an instrument of God,
the pure side will do the most damage.

1676
01:40:06,647 --> 01:40:08,567
Holy shit!
Silent Bob's an instrument of God?

1677
01:40:08,737 --> 01:40:12,567
No, but Glick's the kind of asshole
who'd bless his clubs for a better game.

1678
01:40:12,737 --> 01:40:15,737
- But the sink?
- You've got the divine heritage.

1679
01:40:15,907 --> 01:40:17,997
Sanctifying is just
one of the fringe benefits.

1680
01:40:18,157 --> 01:40:20,707
Remind me to try the water-to-wine
thing at my next party.

1681
01:40:20,877 --> 01:40:23,667
- How far away is this church?
- Three towns over, about 10 miles.

1682
01:40:23,837 --> 01:40:25,837
- Rufus, grab the gun.
- Ten steps ahead of you.

1683
01:40:26,007 --> 01:40:28,167
Take the bartender's car.
He won't need it.

1684
01:40:28,337 --> 01:40:31,587
The whole fucking world's against us,
dude, I swear to God.

1685
01:40:43,307 --> 01:40:45,017
Oh, my God.

1686
01:40:57,787 --> 01:41:00,457
And people wonder why
I don't go to church anymore.

1687
01:41:00,617 --> 01:41:01,787
Are we too late?

1688
01:41:01,957 --> 01:41:04,457
To save these poor schmucks?

1689
01:41:06,297 --> 01:41:07,337
Yeah.

1690
01:41:07,507 --> 01:41:10,087
But we still exist.

1691
01:41:10,257 --> 01:41:11,967
Where are they?

1692
01:41:12,137 --> 01:41:14,547
They could already be
in the church.

1693
01:41:14,717 --> 01:41:16,757
So if they come out,
nobody touches them.

1694
01:41:16,927 --> 01:41:18,137
Are you fucking shitting me?

1695
01:41:18,306 --> 01:41:21,136
The brother is gonna shred them
with his angel-be-good special...

1696
01:41:21,306 --> 01:41:22,306
...ain't you, homey?

1697
01:41:22,476 --> 01:41:24,476
If they pass through that arch,
they're clean.

1698
01:41:24,646 --> 01:41:26,566
And if they die, they go straight up.

1699
01:41:26,726 --> 01:41:29,066
And, hello!
We know what happens then, right?

1700
01:41:29,236 --> 01:41:31,486
- Why don't they kill themselves?
- It's a mortal sin.

1701
01:41:31,656 --> 01:41:34,486
Die with a mortal sin and you burn.
They don't wanna go to hell.

1702
01:41:34,656 --> 01:41:38,326
Then what are we supposed to do,
wait for a solution to fall from the sky?

1703
01:41:42,616 --> 01:41:43,916
Friend of yours?

1704
01:41:44,076 --> 01:41:45,956
No, that was a cardinal.

1705
01:41:46,126 --> 01:41:49,836
You can't tell from his face,
but the rosaries are a dead giveaway.

1706
01:41:50,006 --> 01:41:52,506
It's one of them!
Kill that motherfucker!

1707
01:41:52,676 --> 01:41:53,836
Don't you listen?

1708
01:41:54,006 --> 01:41:56,926
- We can't touch him!
- I wasn't. I was gonna shoot his ass.

1709
01:41:57,096 --> 01:41:59,266
He's been at it for a while now.

1710
01:41:59,426 --> 01:42:01,016
Please! Please!

1711
01:42:02,186 --> 01:42:04,016
We ran out of parishioners...

1712
01:42:04,186 --> 01:42:08,476
...so he just started picking up folk
off the road and just dropping them.

1713
01:42:08,646 --> 01:42:11,776
This is just eons of repression
getting purged.

1714
01:42:12,816 --> 01:42:14,856
If only they'd let us jerk off,
you know?

1715
01:42:16,776 --> 01:42:18,036
Take a step back.

1716
01:42:22,416 --> 01:42:23,826
Let me go!

1717
01:42:25,036 --> 01:42:27,206
Why? What are you trying to prove?

1718
01:42:27,376 --> 01:42:30,706
- All these people!
- Hey, this wasn't my idea!

1719
01:42:31,836 --> 01:42:33,176
Jesus Christ!

1720
01:42:34,546 --> 01:42:36,386
I just wanted to go home.

1721
01:42:36,546 --> 01:42:38,346
But him, you know...

1722
01:42:38,506 --> 01:42:40,806
...he just lost it.

1723
01:42:40,976 --> 01:42:44,056
He realized who you were
and what you were gonna have to do.

1724
01:42:44,226 --> 01:42:45,646
He just snapped.

1725
01:42:45,806 --> 01:42:49,316
And the funny thing is, this guy could
never even stand to see me work.

1726
01:42:49,476 --> 01:42:52,526
He said he felt sorry
for you people.

1727
01:42:53,655 --> 01:42:55,065
Now look at him.

1728
01:42:55,235 --> 01:42:57,235
This guy's fucking drunker
than hell.

1729
01:42:57,405 --> 01:42:59,825
Which means he's human now.

1730
01:43:01,245 --> 01:43:03,325
His wings have been cut off.

1731
01:43:03,825 --> 01:43:05,415
Loki...

1732
01:43:08,035 --> 01:43:09,745
Loki.

1733
01:43:09,915 --> 01:43:11,795
The muse?

1734
01:43:11,955 --> 01:43:14,005
Oh, no way!

1735
01:43:14,175 --> 01:43:16,885
I haven't seen you...
You look terrific.

1736
01:43:17,045 --> 01:43:19,095
What's with the tits? Can I...

1737
01:43:19,255 --> 01:43:21,425
Have you walked
through the arch yet?

1738
01:43:24,845 --> 01:43:28,355
Tell me. Have you gone in and
come out through the archway yet?

1739
01:43:28,515 --> 01:43:29,765
No!

1740
01:43:35,195 --> 01:43:36,275
He's back.

1741
01:43:59,675 --> 01:44:01,595
We were awaiting your arrival.

1742
01:44:01,765 --> 01:44:04,725
Bartleby, wait. Stop. Listen to me.

1743
01:44:04,885 --> 01:44:07,475
You can't go through with this.
Azrael was just using you.

1744
01:44:07,645 --> 01:44:08,805
If you go back...

1745
01:44:09,815 --> 01:44:11,515
I've become aware
of the repercussions.

1746
01:44:11,685 --> 01:44:12,725
I know what I'm doing.

1747
01:44:14,275 --> 01:44:15,815
You sick, twisted fuck!

1748
01:44:17,485 --> 01:44:18,655
Bethany.

1749
01:44:21,905 --> 01:44:25,155
You, of all people, should understand
what I'm trying to accomplish here.

1750
01:44:25,325 --> 01:44:28,164
You too know what it feels like
to be cast aside.

1751
01:44:28,324 --> 01:44:31,334
But you've only dealt with the pain
a few years.

1752
01:44:31,494 --> 01:44:33,914
I've dealt with it for a millennia.

1753
01:44:34,084 --> 01:44:36,164
And while you never see
your ex-husband...

1754
01:44:36,334 --> 01:44:39,674
...or how blissful he is
with his new wife...

1755
01:44:40,634 --> 01:44:41,844
And he is.

1756
01:44:45,054 --> 01:44:49,764
- seeing you people every day on this
perfect world he created for you...

1757
01:44:49,934 --> 01:44:51,514
...is a constant reminder...

1758
01:44:51,684 --> 01:44:54,684
...that though my kind came first...

1759
01:44:54,854 --> 01:44:57,444
...your kind was most revered.

1760
01:44:58,154 --> 01:45:00,444
And while you know forgiveness...

1761
01:45:00,614 --> 01:45:02,524
...we know only regret.

1762
01:45:03,994 --> 01:45:05,364
The lesson must be taught.

1763
01:45:05,534 --> 01:45:07,284
All are accountable...

1764
01:45:07,454 --> 01:45:08,704
...even God.

1765
01:45:10,034 --> 01:45:12,164
Soon a cadre of police will arrive...

1766
01:45:12,334 --> 01:45:16,044
...just in time to kill us
as we exit the church.

1767
01:45:16,794 --> 01:45:20,214
Then this failed experiment
called existence...

1768
01:45:20,384 --> 01:45:21,794
...will cease to be.

1769
01:45:21,964 --> 01:45:23,464
No. Hey. Hey!

1770
01:45:24,134 --> 01:45:26,054
No. No.

1771
01:45:26,224 --> 01:45:28,054
I can't let you do that, Bartleby.

1772
01:45:28,554 --> 01:45:30,224
This has gone too far.

1773
01:45:32,354 --> 01:45:34,724
I might have to take you down.

1774
01:45:36,234 --> 01:45:38,024
It's okay.

1775
01:45:38,194 --> 01:45:39,734
I'll do it.

1776
01:45:44,534 --> 01:45:46,404
My compatriot.

1777
01:45:47,864 --> 01:45:50,284
Genocide takes a lot out of him.

1778
01:45:50,454 --> 01:45:51,664
He's weakened.

1779
01:45:51,834 --> 01:45:53,164
You're weak.

1780
01:45:53,334 --> 01:45:56,084
More importantly,
he's also a human being...

1781
01:45:56,254 --> 01:45:58,374
...a condition which carries
two liabilities.

1782
01:46:00,214 --> 01:46:02,003
A conscience...

1783
01:46:02,803 --> 01:46:04,253
...and...

1784
01:46:07,263 --> 01:46:09,763
...a short life span.

1785
01:46:09,933 --> 01:46:12,683
I'm sorry, old friend,
but you lost the faith.

1786
01:46:40,463 --> 01:46:42,383
Oh, my God. He's lost it.
We're fucked.

1787
01:46:42,543 --> 01:46:44,753
- We're absolutely fucked!
- I hear that shit.

1788
01:46:46,213 --> 01:46:47,553
I can't believe this shit.

1789
01:46:47,723 --> 01:46:50,303
We're on the brink of nonexistence
and God's still missing.

1790
01:46:50,473 --> 01:46:53,433
- What kind of deity gets kidnapped?
- Amen to that.

1791
01:47:00,313 --> 01:47:02,443
What the hell are you doing?

1792
01:47:02,613 --> 01:47:05,983
If the whole world's gonna end,
you said you'd fuck me.

1793
01:47:10,153 --> 01:47:12,993
- You're a pig.
- Nobody's gonna beat that thing.

1794
01:47:13,163 --> 01:47:16,663
We can lay here all comatose like that
John Doe Jersey bastard over there...

1795
01:47:16,833 --> 01:47:19,663
- ...or we can get making with the love.
- What did you say?

1796
01:47:19,833 --> 01:47:21,833
Make with the love.
It's a nice way of saying boning.

1797
01:47:22,003 --> 01:47:23,463
No, about John Doe Jersey.

1798
01:47:27,343 --> 01:47:30,173
That guy they won't take off
life support, John Doe Jersey.

1799
01:47:30,343 --> 01:47:32,343
This is where he's at,
St. Michael's Hospital.

1800
01:47:34,013 --> 01:47:35,353
Where's the nearest boardwalk?

1801
01:47:35,513 --> 01:47:38,102
I ain't got time to win you a prize.
We gotta get to the fucking.

1802
01:47:38,272 --> 01:47:40,642
- Where is it?
- Asbury Park, about five miles away.

1803
01:47:40,812 --> 01:47:42,692
- Have you been there?
- Once, with a chick.

1804
01:47:42,852 --> 01:47:45,862
We were about to fuck on the carousel
and I got sick, started puking.

1805
01:47:46,022 --> 01:47:47,822
- Do they have skeeball there?
- Yeah.

1806
01:47:51,322 --> 01:47:53,202
That's what I'm talking about.

1807
01:48:01,212 --> 01:48:04,212
Whatever you do, stall Bartleby
from going into that church.

1808
01:48:04,382 --> 01:48:06,462
Bob, come with me. Come on!

1809
01:48:06,632 --> 01:48:09,212
- How am I supposed to do that?
- Think of something!

1810
01:48:09,382 --> 01:48:11,552
I already did, but it takes two of us!

1811
01:48:12,432 --> 01:48:14,642
I repeat, this is not a drill.

1812
01:48:14,802 --> 01:48:16,472
This is the apocalypse.

1813
01:48:16,642 --> 01:48:19,312
Please exit the hospital
in an orderly fashion.

1814
01:48:19,472 --> 01:48:21,142
Thank you.

1815
01:48:36,582 --> 01:48:38,202
Hey, Big Bird!

1816
01:48:39,162 --> 01:48:40,752
Ready for the counting game?

1817
01:48:40,912 --> 01:48:42,502
No!

1818
01:48:45,582 --> 01:48:47,502
Count the shells, Suck-a-Duck.

1819
01:49:15,741 --> 01:49:17,621
No more bullets.

1820
01:49:17,781 --> 01:49:19,911
Now, what the fuck
would you do that for?

1821
01:49:20,081 --> 01:49:22,911
Angels have to cut their wings off
to become human.

1822
01:49:23,081 --> 01:49:25,081
You just did him a favor, stupid!

1823
01:50:11,841 --> 01:50:14,511
I hope you're the skeeball type.

1824
01:50:55,670 --> 01:50:58,050
Oh, Bartleby.

1825
01:50:58,220 --> 01:51:01,800
Was Wisconsin really that bad?

1826
01:51:01,970 --> 01:51:03,970
Bow down, stupid!

1827
01:51:22,580 --> 01:51:24,490
I'm sorry.

1828
01:51:47,350 --> 01:51:50,020
Anyone who isn't dead
or from another plane of existence...

1829
01:51:50,190 --> 01:51:53,900
...would do well to cover their ears
right about now.

1830
01:51:54,070 --> 01:51:56,030
What the fuck?

1831
01:52:02,200 --> 01:52:04,200
Thank you.

1832
01:52:36,029 --> 01:52:37,989
It never ends!

1833
01:52:57,709 --> 01:52:59,799
Get off of me.
I wanna see what's up.

1834
01:53:00,339 --> 01:53:02,339
What the fuck is this shit?

1835
01:53:02,509 --> 01:53:04,139
Who the fuck are you, Lady?

1836
01:53:04,299 --> 01:53:06,679
Why the fuck did you hug my head?

1837
01:53:06,849 --> 01:53:09,679
Quite a little mouth on him,
isn't there?

1838
01:53:09,849 --> 01:53:12,689
What the fuck is this, The Piano?
Why ain't this broad talking?

1839
01:53:12,849 --> 01:53:18,149
I believe the answers that you seek
lie within my companion's eyes.

1840
01:53:18,319 --> 01:53:21,489
What the fuck does that mean?
Has everyone gone fucking nuts?

1841
01:53:21,659 --> 01:53:24,529
What the fuck happened
to that guy's head? I want some...

1842
01:53:42,179 --> 01:53:43,839
Where was she?

1843
01:53:44,549 --> 01:53:46,469
Imprisoned in a body.

1844
01:53:46,639 --> 01:53:49,979
Bethany figured it all out.
She's a clever girl, that one.

1845
01:53:51,019 --> 01:53:52,559
Hang on a minute.

1846
01:54:27,098 --> 01:54:29,008
You missed a bit.

1847
01:54:30,558 --> 01:54:33,438
Well, then, you ready
to go back, apostle?

1848
01:54:33,598 --> 01:54:35,938
You ready to make those changes
I been talking about?

1849
01:54:36,268 --> 01:54:38,858
We'll see. Muse?

1850
01:54:39,028 --> 01:54:41,488
Seeing as how you
just had to get involved...

1851
01:54:41,648 --> 01:54:43,858
...you're welcome
to return with us as well.

1852
01:54:44,028 --> 01:54:46,818
First I gotta say goodbye to Bethany.
Where is she?

1853
01:54:46,988 --> 01:54:48,408
Oh, no.

1854
01:55:09,638 --> 01:55:12,098
Metatron, is she...?

1855
01:55:12,268 --> 01:55:14,478
Afraid so.

1856
01:55:14,648 --> 01:55:18,518
One of the drawbacks to being
a martyr is that you have to die.

1857
01:55:18,688 --> 01:55:20,648
But no matter.

1858
01:55:30,737 --> 01:55:33,077
All is being taken care of.

1859
01:55:33,827 --> 01:55:35,537
How so?

1860
01:55:36,327 --> 01:55:39,457
Wax on, wax off.

1861
01:56:03,027 --> 01:56:04,107
How did I...?

1862
01:56:04,277 --> 01:56:05,857
She can rebuild you.

1863
01:56:06,027 --> 01:56:07,527
She has the technology.

1864
01:56:07,697 --> 01:56:11,697
She can make you better,
stronger, faster.

1865
01:56:17,707 --> 01:56:19,037
That's...

1866
01:56:20,087 --> 01:56:22,877
A very relieved deity.

1867
01:56:24,217 --> 01:56:26,967
You did well, little girl.
I knew you'd come around.

1868
01:56:27,507 --> 01:56:29,467
Your kind always does.

1869
01:56:30,717 --> 01:56:33,137
So you might wanna
take good care of yourself.

1870
01:56:33,307 --> 01:56:35,977
We're gonna need you
down the road.

1871
01:56:36,137 --> 01:56:39,017
I know. I'm the last scion.

1872
01:56:41,227 --> 01:56:44,317
Well, you're half right.

1873
01:56:44,487 --> 01:56:47,397
You were the last scion.

1874
01:56:49,197 --> 01:56:50,907
But now...

1875
01:56:51,617 --> 01:56:53,157
...this...

1876
01:56:53,907 --> 01:56:55,907
...is the last scion.

1877
01:56:59,037 --> 01:57:00,957
I'm pregnant?

1878
01:57:03,506 --> 01:57:05,416
Can't put anything past you.

1879
01:57:08,756 --> 01:57:11,256
Take care of that parcel for us.

1880
01:57:11,426 --> 01:57:15,266
She has a world of work
ahead of her.

1881
01:57:26,776 --> 01:57:28,736
Thank you for...

1882
01:57:28,906 --> 01:57:30,776
...I don't know...

1883
01:57:30,946 --> 01:57:32,116
...everything.

1884
01:57:35,956 --> 01:57:39,286
God, there's a million things
I wish I could ask you...

1885
01:57:39,456 --> 01:57:41,456
...most of it questioning
your great plan...

1886
01:57:41,626 --> 01:57:43,456
...and that'd be arrogant of me,
I know.

1887
01:57:44,296 --> 01:57:46,376
But there is one I need to ask.

1888
01:57:46,546 --> 01:57:50,086
I'm sure you get it all the time, but
how many chances like this will I get?

1889
01:57:52,136 --> 01:57:53,966
Why are we here?

1890
01:58:10,986 --> 01:58:13,576
Didn't I tell you she was funny?

1891
01:58:20,456 --> 01:58:22,996
I really enjoyed meeting you.

1892
01:58:23,786 --> 01:58:25,916
It was an honor.

1893
01:58:30,626 --> 01:58:33,886
You did so well.

1894
01:58:38,345 --> 01:58:41,095
I told you she was a woman.

1895
01:58:43,105 --> 01:58:45,395
She's not really a woman.

1896
01:58:45,565 --> 01:58:47,935
She's not really anything.

1897
01:58:48,105 --> 01:58:50,195
She's something, all right.

1898
01:58:50,945 --> 01:58:53,115
Crisis of faith over?

1899
01:58:53,275 --> 01:58:56,115
I think I'm now burdened
with an overabundance.

1900
01:58:56,285 --> 01:58:58,115
When it rains, it pours.

1901
01:58:58,285 --> 01:59:00,495
Are you saying you believe?

1902
01:59:00,665 --> 01:59:03,705
No. But I have a good idea.

1903
01:59:03,875 --> 01:59:05,455
Yes.

1904
01:59:09,295 --> 01:59:11,085
The man was right about you.

1905
01:59:11,255 --> 01:59:14,255
Now I'm gonna go home
and tell him so.

1906
01:59:15,175 --> 01:59:17,055
And if you clean up your language...

1907
01:59:17,215 --> 01:59:19,555
...I just might put in
a good word for you too.

1908
01:59:20,225 --> 01:59:21,635
Thanks.

1909
01:59:23,185 --> 01:59:25,725
Why don't you name the kid
after me?

1910
01:59:28,105 --> 01:59:29,855
Rufus.

1911
01:59:56,345 --> 01:59:58,715
Yo, we should go to Quick Stop.

1912
02:00:03,555 --> 02:00:05,435
You guys wanna
hear something sick?

1913
02:00:05,605 --> 02:00:08,435
- I got half a stalk when she kissed me.
- Jay!

1914
02:00:08,605 --> 02:00:10,935
I couldn't help it. The bitch was hot.

1915
02:00:11,105 --> 02:00:15,564
You can't talk to me that way anymore.
I'm gonna be somebody's mother.

1916
02:00:15,734 --> 02:00:17,194
You're pregnant?

1917
02:00:18,864 --> 02:00:22,324
Yo, I heard pregnant women can
have sex into their third trimester.

1918
02:00:22,494 --> 02:00:24,414
I'll keep that in mind.

1919
02:08:04,506 --> 02:08:08,529
So that would make Bethany
part black?
