1
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,039
- Can I help you, pardner?
- If you please.

2
00:02:21,128 --> 00:02:23,536
- What do you wanna do with it?
- Right up over there.

3
00:02:23,631 --> 00:02:25,624
That's it.

4
00:02:42,655 --> 00:02:46,239
- I guess you're leaving.
- You're a good guesser.

5
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:51,499
Goodbye, Willie. And thank you
for being the only man here

6
00:02:51,584 --> 00:02:53,624
not to make an indecent proposal.

7
00:02:53,711 --> 00:02:56,250
If I'd had my strength I might have.

8
00:02:57,007 --> 00:02:59,760
Tell her to sing loud and watch out
for the manager's hands.

9
00:02:59,844 --> 00:03:01,884
Good luck, Billie.

10
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:11,515
- Say, can a fella eat in here?
- Sure, go right on in.

11
00:03:31,051 --> 00:03:32,676
(Horse neighs)

12
00:03:32,761 --> 00:03:35,169
- Can you care for a horse?
- Sure.

13
00:03:35,264 --> 00:03:38,930
Henry, got a customer.
Wants you to stable his horse.

14
00:03:40,271 --> 00:03:42,311
That's just fine.

15
00:03:43,567 --> 00:03:45,809
- What's your name?
- Link Jones.

16
00:03:45,903 --> 00:03:49,522
- Link Jones? J-O-N-E-S?
- That's right.

17
00:03:49,616 --> 00:03:51,609
Where you from?

18
00:03:51,702 --> 00:03:54,573
Oh, west of here five days... Good Hope.

19
00:03:55,749 --> 00:03:57,742
How much do you charge?

20
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:00,745
Two bits a day. A dollar in advance.

21
00:04:00,839 --> 00:04:03,247
Tom, take care of his horse, will you?

22
00:04:04,176 --> 00:04:05,172
Thanks.

23
00:04:05,261 --> 00:04:09,010
- Where can a fellow wash up around here?
- Out there in back.

24
00:04:11,185 --> 00:04:13,225
(Horse neighs)

25
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:49,017
(Train whistle)

26
00:04:50,151 --> 00:04:52,310
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

27
00:04:53,865 --> 00:04:56,535
- Ticket to Fort Worth, please.
- Yes, sir.

28
00:04:57,411 --> 00:04:59,487
That's 8.35, sir.

29
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:07,413
- Here's your change.
- Thank you.

30
00:05:17,103 --> 00:05:19,641
(Bell ringing)

31
00:05:27,658 --> 00:05:29,947
(Train whistle)

32
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:37,626
Makes you want to
holler right back, don't it?

33
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:43,587
First one I saw, I let out a yap
you could've heard in Arkansas.

34
00:05:45,138 --> 00:05:47,096
What do you think?

35
00:05:47,183 --> 00:05:49,639
That's the ugliest thing I ever saw.

36
00:05:49,727 --> 00:05:51,768
You never saw my ex-wife.

37
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:10,744
Is that man a friend of yours?

38
00:06:14,801 --> 00:06:16,759
Where are you from?

39
00:06:16,845 --> 00:06:19,717
Five days west of here,
a little settlement.

40
00:06:19,808 --> 00:06:22,845
- What's it called?
- Sawmill.

41
00:06:22,937 --> 00:06:24,894
Have I ever seen you before?

42
00:06:26,566 --> 00:06:28,606
You mind if I ask your name?

43
00:06:29,445 --> 00:06:31,983
Henry Wright.

44
00:06:32,908 --> 00:06:35,695
And I don't know you?

45
00:06:35,786 --> 00:06:38,705
- From a long time back, maybe?
- I said no.

46
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:43,045
Did you ever hear the name Dock Tobin?

47
00:06:45,549 --> 00:06:48,716
- You're sure, now? Dock Tobin.
- I'm sure.

48
00:06:49,554 --> 00:06:52,176
All aboard!

49
00:06:52,266 --> 00:06:54,840
If I was you,
I'd watch out who I was talking to.

50
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:15,742
Look after the children
and have fun, dear. Goodbye.

51
00:07:49,172 --> 00:07:50,880
Aboard!

52
00:07:50,965 --> 00:07:52,757
All aboard!

53
00:07:52,843 --> 00:07:55,169
East Fork, next stop!

54
00:07:55,263 --> 00:07:57,754
El Paso, Fort Worth.

55
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:17,582
All aboard!

56
00:08:18,584 --> 00:08:20,826
(Whistle)

57
00:09:15,782 --> 00:09:17,859
Mind some company?

58
00:09:17,951 --> 00:09:19,992
Name is Sam Beasley.

59
00:09:30,175 --> 00:09:33,213
That's some country
we'll be going through.

60
00:09:33,304 --> 00:09:37,220
Nothing but a bunch of
rattlers and tarantulas.

61
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:42,106
Through that area where those
important outlaws used to ride.

62
00:09:42,191 --> 00:09:45,857
Johnny Beggs,
Dock Tobin, and all those...

63
00:09:48,574 --> 00:09:51,030
How you doing now?

64
00:09:51,119 --> 00:09:53,575
Oh, I'm beginning to get the hang of it.

65
00:09:53,664 --> 00:09:56,749
Yeah, I guess a man
can get used to anything.

66
00:09:56,834 --> 00:09:58,662
I remember once...

67
00:10:00,297 --> 00:10:02,789
- I didn't get your name.
- Jones.

68
00:10:07,598 --> 00:10:12,475
You must be going to Fort Worth
on a big cattle deal, Mr Jones.

69
00:10:12,563 --> 00:10:15,185
I think, from the way
you carry yourself,

70
00:10:15,275 --> 00:10:17,315
you're a cattleman.

71
00:10:17,986 --> 00:10:20,110
One of my many hobbies

72
00:10:20,198 --> 00:10:22,606
is observing the people around me.

73
00:10:22,701 --> 00:10:27,530
Keeping my eyes open
for their peculiarities, so that I can...

74
00:10:27,624 --> 00:10:31,373
I'm on my way to Fort Worth
to hire a schoolteacher.

75
00:10:31,462 --> 00:10:36,374
Is that so? Well, that's pretty interesting.

76
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:42,431
What would a gent like you
want with a schoolteacher?

77
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:45,722
We're starting a school in my town.

78
00:10:45,814 --> 00:10:50,275
Oh. Well, good for you.

79
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:54,356
- What town is that?
- Good Hope.

80
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:58,579
Good... You know you have to pay her
a year in advance

81
00:10:58,663 --> 00:11:01,582
- to get her to come this far west.
- That's right.

82
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:05,203
Well, I guess that takes a little money.

83
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:09,882
- We've raised it.
- And they picked you to choose her?

84
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:12,971
I guess that's quite an honour.
Don't say that.

85
00:11:13,057 --> 00:11:17,007
You know, it's mighty interesting

86
00:11:17,103 --> 00:11:20,022
that you should
bump into me on this train.

87
00:11:20,107 --> 00:11:21,851
Tickets. Tickets, please.

88
00:11:22,569 --> 00:11:23,980
I...

89
00:11:29,119 --> 00:11:33,663
I might be able to help you find somebody
when we get to Fort Worth.

90
00:11:35,085 --> 00:11:39,547
Glad to have met you, Mr Jones.
See you again.

91
00:11:44,597 --> 00:11:48,726
Hello, Billie.
Billie, you're looking very good.

92
00:11:48,811 --> 00:11:51,765
Thanks. I thought the only thing
that looked good to you

93
00:11:51,856 --> 00:11:53,896
was a marked deck.

94
00:11:53,984 --> 00:11:56,522
Billie, mind if I sit down?

95
00:12:00,242 --> 00:12:02,069
Thanks.

96
00:12:03,329 --> 00:12:06,366
You know, it's interesting
who you meet on a train.

97
00:13:04,657 --> 00:13:08,277
This is East Fork.
East Fork wood stop.

98
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,700
All able-bodied men
are requested to pitch in

99
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:15,830
and give us a hand
loading wood for the engine.

100
00:13:15,922 --> 00:13:19,755
The more help we have,
the quicker we can get started again.

101
00:13:19,843 --> 00:13:23,344
The Fort Worth and Chihuahua
appreciates your help.

102
00:13:54,095 --> 00:13:56,634
- You going out to help?
- That's right.

103
00:13:58,142 --> 00:14:00,764
I don't mean to trouble you, Mr...

104
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,769
- Jones.
- Jones!

105
00:14:03,858 --> 00:14:07,025
But there's somebody here
I think you ought to meet.

106
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:08,939
Miss Ellis...

107
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:13,487
Miss Ellis, I'd like to present Mr Jones.

108
00:14:13,579 --> 00:14:16,414
- How do you do, Mr Jones?
- Hello, Miss Ellis.

109
00:14:16,499 --> 00:14:19,204
The reason I wanted you to meet Miss Ellis

110
00:14:19,294 --> 00:14:21,252
is a strange coincidence.

111
00:14:21,338 --> 00:14:25,337
It's pretty unusual that
the three of us are on this train.

112
00:14:25,427 --> 00:14:28,097
I even get a creepy feeling about it.

113
00:14:28,181 --> 00:14:30,174
You ask me why? I'll tell you.

114
00:14:31,059 --> 00:14:33,385
Miss Ellis - that is, Miss Billie Ellis,

115
00:14:33,479 --> 00:14:37,063
is a singer with
what you might call an operatic voice.

116
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,811
A lady of real culture.

117
00:14:38,903 --> 00:14:43,233
But the amazing part is,
she was trained as a schoolteacher.

118
00:14:44,034 --> 00:14:45,445
Really?

119
00:14:46,287 --> 00:14:49,491
Now, why would Mr Jones
be interested in that?

120
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:54,579
Mr Jones is on this train
looking for a schoolteacher.

121
00:14:54,673 --> 00:14:58,968
You're riding to Fort Worth to find her,
isn't that right?

122
00:14:59,888 --> 00:15:03,471
Wouldn't that make your hair
stand up straight?

123
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:08,353
We ought to talk this over
while they're hauling that wood.

124
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:15,025
You gentlemen ought to be loading wood.
We're behind schedule.

125
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:17,274
Would you keep an eye on my bag?

126
00:15:17,368 --> 00:15:19,445
Sure thing. I'll be right here.

127
00:15:20,289 --> 00:15:23,409
Maybe we can talk
when the train pulls out.

128
00:15:23,501 --> 00:15:25,660
Mr Jones wants to stretch his legs...

129
00:15:25,754 --> 00:15:29,171
although I don't see why
he'd want them any longer.

130
00:15:29,258 --> 00:15:31,299
Excuse me, Miss Ellis.

131
00:15:34,473 --> 00:15:36,301
Beautiful job.

132
00:15:58,045 --> 00:16:00,963
Let's see if we can stay on schedule.

133
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:42,049
(Screaming)

134
00:16:54,784 --> 00:16:56,824
Let's get to the baggage car.

135
00:17:09,344 --> 00:17:11,385
(Gunshot)

136
00:17:23,487 --> 00:17:25,362
Let's get this thing rolling!

137
00:18:22,771 --> 00:18:26,022
(Man) Hello? Hello?

138
00:18:26,109 --> 00:18:29,230
(Man groaning)

139
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:40,115
Oh... Oh... Oh...

140
00:18:44,049 --> 00:18:45,923
Who is it?

141
00:18:46,009 --> 00:18:48,797
Oh, it's you. I thought it was...

142
00:18:49,514 --> 00:18:51,970
I was running, and I fell down.

143
00:18:52,059 --> 00:18:55,559
My heart feels as if
it's going to jump out of my chest.

144
00:18:57,357 --> 00:18:59,397
What happened here?

145
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:04,270
Were they trying to...? Oh...

146
00:19:05,493 --> 00:19:08,660
Hey, listen. I think this is busted.

147
00:19:10,374 --> 00:19:13,329
- They were holding up the train?
- That's right.

148
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:16,754
How could they leave us like this?
We could starve.

149
00:19:17,842 --> 00:19:21,793
Hey, Billie. You all right?
You hurt or anything?

150
00:19:22,431 --> 00:19:24,923
- No.
- I hurt my ankle.

151
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:41,576
You wouldn't leave us out here alone,
would you, Mr Jones?

152
00:19:44,668 --> 00:19:47,338
- Just asking.
- When is the next train?

153
00:19:47,421 --> 00:19:49,710
Runs once a week.

154
00:19:51,969 --> 00:19:54,460
Do you talk?

155
00:19:54,555 --> 00:19:56,798
He just gave you the answer.

156
00:19:58,143 --> 00:20:00,350
- You're hurt.
- It's nothing.

157
00:20:01,189 --> 00:20:04,523
- Should have it tended to.
- No, I'm all right.

158
00:20:05,486 --> 00:20:09,271
- Where's the nearest town?
- Maybe a hundred miles.

159
00:20:10,117 --> 00:20:14,116
A hundred miles?
What are we going to do?

160
00:20:14,205 --> 00:20:16,614
I guess we'll have to walk.

161
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:19,959
We'd better find shelter
or you two will freeze.

162
00:20:20,046 --> 00:20:23,630
- I can't walk on this foot!
- Then I'll have to carry you.

163
00:20:26,471 --> 00:20:29,093
I bet you're glad you've got company.

164
00:20:29,183 --> 00:20:31,010
I wouldn't say that.

165
00:20:31,102 --> 00:20:33,178
Oh, we'll be a comfort to you.

166
00:20:34,147 --> 00:20:37,102
I'll sing Tenting Tonight a little off-key,

167
00:20:37,193 --> 00:20:40,978
and Sam can teach you how to deal
off the bottom of the deck.

168
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,909
You'll be a richer and a happier man.

169
00:20:47,957 --> 00:20:50,875
- What are you looking at?
- Your shoes.

170
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:53,962
My shoes?

171
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,166
That makes this trip worthwhile.

172
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:00,345
You're the first man
that's looked at that part of me

173
00:21:00,431 --> 00:21:02,471
since I was 14 years old.

174
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,560
Those shoes won't last a day
out here.

175
00:21:05,646 --> 00:21:07,853
Then I'll walk without them.

176
00:21:50,453 --> 00:21:52,078
Still standing.

177
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,617
How did you know about it?

178
00:21:57,379 --> 00:21:59,621
I used to live here once.

179
00:22:01,384 --> 00:22:03,792
When you were a boy?

180
00:22:03,887 --> 00:22:06,213
I don't know what I was.

181
00:22:47,818 --> 00:22:49,692
Who owns this place?

182
00:22:49,779 --> 00:22:53,730
It belonged to a nester
but somebody shot him.

183
00:22:56,329 --> 00:22:58,369
You two go into the barn.

184
00:24:29,489 --> 00:24:31,067
Come in.

185
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:36,739
The man with the gun ain't got no voice,
or he'd invite you his-self.

186
00:24:36,832 --> 00:24:38,077
Come in!

187
00:24:41,922 --> 00:24:43,749
Stop there.

188
00:24:45,843 --> 00:24:48,382
Now, what can we do for you?

189
00:24:48,472 --> 00:24:50,880
Looks like I called at the wrong time.

190
00:24:50,975 --> 00:24:52,386
Close the door, Trout.

191
00:25:28,857 --> 00:25:30,980
What happened to your head?

192
00:25:31,068 --> 00:25:33,108
Fellow dropped one of those on it.

193
00:25:33,196 --> 00:25:35,189
That's too bad.

194
00:25:38,577 --> 00:25:40,571
Where you from?

195
00:25:40,663 --> 00:25:42,491
West of here a ways.

196
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:45,454
- What's the name of the place?
- Sawmill.

197
00:25:47,964 --> 00:25:51,714
- What do you want here?
- I got left by the train.

198
00:25:51,803 --> 00:25:55,552
Just looking for a roof for the night.
I can move on.

199
00:25:55,641 --> 00:25:58,512
How'd you find this place, mister?

200
00:25:58,603 --> 00:26:01,640
Just stumbled into it.
I guess you'd call it lu...

201
00:26:06,697 --> 00:26:09,948
Luck. (Chuckles)

202
00:26:10,034 --> 00:26:12,360
Good or bad luck?

203
00:26:12,454 --> 00:26:14,743
He'll be dead
by tomorrow morning.

204
00:26:14,832 --> 00:26:16,825
He's got a hole in his back.

205
00:26:24,845 --> 00:26:26,505
Hello, Link.

206
00:26:35,525 --> 00:26:38,396
Come shake hands
with your Uncle Dock Tobin.

207
00:26:46,289 --> 00:26:48,365
You've been gone a while.

208
00:26:50,419 --> 00:26:52,246
How long has it been? Five years?

209
00:26:52,338 --> 00:26:54,378
A lot longer than that.

210
00:26:54,466 --> 00:26:57,717
I don't keep track of time
very good any more.

211
00:27:00,474 --> 00:27:02,763
You look fine. Been eating good?

212
00:27:02,852 --> 00:27:06,056
- Yes.
- That's the thing.

213
00:27:06,147 --> 00:27:07,975
You eat good.

214
00:27:10,445 --> 00:27:15,191
This is really something,
seeing you again.

215
00:27:21,709 --> 00:27:23,951
I remember the day you left me.

216
00:27:24,045 --> 00:27:27,711
Oh, Lord, do I remember it.

217
00:27:30,512 --> 00:27:32,505
You were my right arm.

218
00:27:36,603 --> 00:27:38,596
You ran off and left me.

219
00:27:38,689 --> 00:27:41,644
God have mercy
on my black bloody soul.

220
00:27:42,903 --> 00:27:46,154
(Laughs) I was so mad,

221
00:27:47,283 --> 00:27:51,578
I could take and push your guts
right out through your back

222
00:27:51,664 --> 00:27:55,449
and I would have done it too
if you had been standing there.

223
00:27:55,544 --> 00:27:58,000
(Laughs)

224
00:27:58,089 --> 00:28:00,627
I'd have opened you up wide.

225
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:07,717
My right arm, trained by me.

226
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:12,679
I put a piece of work into you.

227
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:20,200
Every last idea that shot
through your head was mine.

228
00:28:20,284 --> 00:28:23,155
I remember every bloody minute of it.

229
00:28:25,123 --> 00:28:31,495
The glory of Uvalde and Saltillo
and Black Fork.

230
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,916
Remember them names?

231
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:36,299
Ha? Uvalde?

232
00:28:36,388 --> 00:28:41,217
God forgive us, we painted their walls
with blood that time. Oh!

233
00:28:41,311 --> 00:28:45,523
(Laughs) Walked out of that bank
with $11,000.

234
00:28:45,608 --> 00:28:49,108
You and me, Claude riding behind us.

235
00:28:52,325 --> 00:28:55,112
Then we murdered
old Ben Scull together.

236
00:28:55,203 --> 00:28:58,205
You held him, I took off the top of his head.

237
00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:03,161
$11,000.

238
00:29:03,923 --> 00:29:07,506
We were big! Don't you remember?

239
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,630
I remember.

240
00:29:11,891 --> 00:29:14,015
You were my property.

241
00:29:14,102 --> 00:29:16,808
What did you go off and leave me for?

242
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:20,811
I wanted to strike out on my own.

243
00:29:22,029 --> 00:29:24,521
I needed you that time.

244
00:29:25,659 --> 00:29:29,159
I could have killed you. We fell apart!

245
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:32,413
Look at these pigs.

246
00:29:36,172 --> 00:29:38,462
This morning,

247
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:40,793
had a train all lined up.

248
00:29:41,637 --> 00:29:43,796
Bank money riding on it.

249
00:29:44,892 --> 00:29:47,051
One stinking guard!

250
00:29:51,483 --> 00:29:53,856
And they let it get away.

251
00:29:58,909 --> 00:30:02,244
Oh, there's no guts any more!

252
00:30:09,465 --> 00:30:11,505
I got nobody left.

253
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:15,552
Just your cousin Claude.

254
00:30:16,932 --> 00:30:19,851
He's riding over from Crosscut.
Remember Claude?

255
00:30:24,567 --> 00:30:28,613
He's a nice, quiet, cold one.

256
00:30:31,284 --> 00:30:33,158
He ain't changed a bit.

257
00:30:33,245 --> 00:30:36,163
(Man whimpering)

258
00:30:36,249 --> 00:30:38,289
That's Alcott.

259
00:30:39,086 --> 00:30:42,041
He's got a hole in his back.
He's gonna die.

260
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:46,586
He wasn't much good anyway.

261
00:30:53,896 --> 00:30:56,470
Why don't you go
and help him out, Ponch?

262
00:30:56,566 --> 00:31:00,019
Show Link Jones here
what kind of man you are.

263
00:31:01,322 --> 00:31:04,443
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean. Do it.

264
00:31:11,168 --> 00:31:13,208
That's what I figured.

265
00:31:14,089 --> 00:31:17,506
Trout! The man's gonna die anyway.

266
00:31:17,593 --> 00:31:19,919
It's the charitable thing to do.

267
00:31:22,057 --> 00:31:24,466
(Laughs)

268
00:31:26,146 --> 00:31:27,688
No guts.

269
00:31:28,858 --> 00:31:32,144
Coaley, you show Link.

270
00:31:32,237 --> 00:31:34,989
Your father and his father
was brothers.

271
00:31:36,284 --> 00:31:38,491
Show him what his family is like.

272
00:31:45,253 --> 00:31:47,294
I'm waiting!

273
00:32:42,535 --> 00:32:45,572
(AIcott choking)

274
00:32:45,664 --> 00:32:48,535
(Gunshots)

275
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:17,328
Well, Link, what's gonna happen with us?

276
00:33:17,413 --> 00:33:19,655
- Are you back with me?
- I'm back.

277
00:33:19,749 --> 00:33:22,620
- Is that the truth?
- That's the truth.

278
00:33:28,051 --> 00:33:30,508
Ponch, make a fire. I'm cold.

279
00:33:42,862 --> 00:33:46,943
Dock, I've got two people with me,
they've walked all day.

280
00:33:48,077 --> 00:33:51,494
- Coaley, bring them in.
- I'll bring them in myself.

281
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,541
He said for me to do it.

282
00:33:56,504 --> 00:33:58,663
I said I'd bring them in.

283
00:34:00,092 --> 00:34:02,418
All right, cousin. You bring them in.

284
00:34:41,854 --> 00:34:44,180
Here they are, Uncle Dock.

285
00:34:44,274 --> 00:34:46,563
- Look at the build on her.
- Yeah.

286
00:34:46,652 --> 00:34:49,523
Her name is Miss Ellis.
This is Mr Beasley.

287
00:34:52,576 --> 00:34:54,486
My name is Sam Beasley.

288
00:34:54,578 --> 00:34:57,497
We can always use
another good hand, Beasley.

289
00:34:57,582 --> 00:35:00,750
There's a man outside digging a grave.
Go help him.

290
00:35:10,182 --> 00:35:12,222
Wait a minute.

291
00:35:12,309 --> 00:35:14,931
- Here.
- (Men laugh)

292
00:35:29,248 --> 00:35:33,745
- This your woman, Link?
- Yes, she's my woman.

293
00:35:38,676 --> 00:35:40,504
I admire your taste.

294
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:48,563
Yeah. My name's Dock Tobin.

295
00:35:50,066 --> 00:35:53,021
D-O-C-K Tobin.
Ever hear that name before?

296
00:35:54,655 --> 00:35:56,613
- Yes.
- Yeah?

297
00:35:56,699 --> 00:35:58,906
Your man used to be with me.

298
00:35:58,994 --> 00:36:02,079
We rode together, killed together.

299
00:36:02,165 --> 00:36:03,992
He ever tell you that?

300
00:36:04,876 --> 00:36:06,537
Yes.

301
00:36:06,629 --> 00:36:09,085
Did you ever tell her that, Link?

302
00:36:09,173 --> 00:36:11,844
We're going to be together again,
isn't that so?

303
00:36:11,927 --> 00:36:13,587
That's right.

304
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:15,672
You came back to ride with me.

305
00:36:15,765 --> 00:36:17,842
- That's why I came back.
- Yeah.

306
00:36:17,935 --> 00:36:23,013
He got left by the train. He's lying.
I don't like having him here.

307
00:36:23,108 --> 00:36:25,730
You're not big enough to shine his boots.

308
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:29,237
- No?
- No. Keep your mouth shut.

309
00:36:47,723 --> 00:36:51,768
- What you been doing, Link?
- Nothing much. Moving around.

310
00:36:51,853 --> 00:36:54,605
Yeah? Where?

311
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,692
All over.

312
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:01,692
- All by yourself?
- All by myself.

313
00:37:03,284 --> 00:37:07,153
Are the pickings pretty good?

314
00:37:10,919 --> 00:37:13,042
Fair.

315
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:22,172
And you came all this way
just to find me, huh?

316
00:37:23,602 --> 00:37:25,844
I was going to Fort Worth
this morning.

317
00:37:25,938 --> 00:37:29,474
I got left and figured
I'd try to find you.

318
00:37:39,038 --> 00:37:41,411
Remember a place called Lassoo?

319
00:37:42,167 --> 00:37:44,920
- Yes.
- (Laughs)

320
00:37:45,004 --> 00:37:50,213
The name makes my tired old heart
pump like a young boy's.

321
00:37:51,095 --> 00:37:54,928
There's a stage bank there. Big one.

322
00:37:55,017 --> 00:37:58,184
All the mines in the area
ship their gold through there.

323
00:37:58,271 --> 00:38:01,189
I've been wanting to take it for years.

324
00:38:01,275 --> 00:38:02,686
Yeah.

325
00:38:04,612 --> 00:38:06,938
It rings in my head like a bell!

326
00:38:07,032 --> 00:38:09,109
Lassoo!

327
00:38:09,202 --> 00:38:10,530
Lassoo bank.

328
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,863
That's the biggest one we ever went after.

329
00:38:12,956 --> 00:38:16,540
- Then we go to Mexico, right?
- Right.

330
00:38:23,637 --> 00:38:26,555
What do you think of Lassoo, Link?

331
00:38:26,641 --> 00:38:28,883
I think the same thing you do.

332
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:31,181
Yeah?

333
00:38:33,357 --> 00:38:36,110
You're going to help me take it.

334
00:38:36,194 --> 00:38:38,947
(Laughs)

335
00:38:41,827 --> 00:38:46,537
Well, Link? If you're with me,
go take Alcott out and bury him.

336
00:39:37,982 --> 00:39:39,975
I can't take no more.

337
00:39:40,068 --> 00:39:42,559
He keeps standing there
with that rifle.

338
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:45,690
He never says nothing.

339
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:47,860
He just keeps looking at you.

340
00:39:47,953 --> 00:39:51,204
He took my pen.
He took my watch and chain.

341
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:54,162
He took everything. Never says anything.

342
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,043
He'll shoot me if I stop digging.

343
00:39:57,131 --> 00:39:59,171
- I'll dig.
- Thank you.

344
00:40:17,323 --> 00:40:19,613
Don't jab me with that rifle.

345
00:40:32,885 --> 00:40:36,337
Do you think we could...?
Could we maybe...

346
00:40:37,432 --> 00:40:41,431
try to run away if we get a chance?
Just the two of us?

347
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,519
Just the two of us?

348
00:40:48,238 --> 00:40:49,863
Go right ahead.

349
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:53,614
They'll run you down
and cut you up into little chunks.

350
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:02,498
You changed.

351
00:41:03,799 --> 00:41:06,801
Since the minute you walked in that shack,
you changed.

352
00:41:06,887 --> 00:41:09,592
You're a different man all of a sudden.

353
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:13,520
You act like you belong with these people.

354
00:41:22,281 --> 00:41:25,568
(Shouting)

355
00:41:25,661 --> 00:41:28,366
What's that?

356
00:41:28,456 --> 00:41:31,208
What's that?

357
00:41:31,293 --> 00:41:33,749
(Billie) Link!

358
00:41:35,965 --> 00:41:38,124
(Coaley) I'd like to say some words.

359
00:41:38,218 --> 00:41:40,342
(Ponch) Let's get this started, lady.

360
00:41:41,222 --> 00:41:43,714
- You're just in time.
- What's going on?

361
00:41:44,476 --> 00:41:48,605
- Your gal's gonna undress for us.
- We saved a seat for you.

362
00:41:49,608 --> 00:41:51,934
It's gonna be a big show.

363
00:41:52,028 --> 00:41:55,148
Who knows?
We might even get a yell out of Trout.

364
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,280
Come on in!

365
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:03,830
All right, lady. Do it.

366
00:42:10,217 --> 00:42:13,670
Are you gonna do it
or should Mr Trout do it for you?

367
00:42:14,807 --> 00:42:19,019
- Start with the shoes.
- Do it slow. We got all night.

368
00:42:19,688 --> 00:42:22,014
Watch this, Uncle Dock.

369
00:42:27,948 --> 00:42:30,025
Well, make her do it!

370
00:42:31,828 --> 00:42:34,071
We're getting impatient!

371
00:42:34,165 --> 00:42:36,205
(Glass shatters)

372
00:42:41,674 --> 00:42:43,335
You see this?

373
00:42:43,426 --> 00:42:45,752
Now, start taking off your clothes!

374
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:51,686
What's the matter with your girl, Link?

375
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:55,519
Maybe she wants to do it
another time.

376
00:42:56,526 --> 00:42:58,187
It's gonna be now.

377
00:42:58,779 --> 00:43:01,900
There's some things
we ought to talk about.

378
00:43:01,992 --> 00:43:04,234
Start taking off your clothes.

379
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:07,822
We ought to talk about Lassoo.

380
00:43:09,293 --> 00:43:10,787
That's right.

381
00:43:10,878 --> 00:43:13,999
When Claude comes tomorrow,
we want to be ready.

382
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,715
Don't want to mess up Lassoo.

383
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:19,927
Link!

384
00:43:20,015 --> 00:43:24,144
- Take that knife away, Coaley.
- You're not talking us out of this.

385
00:43:24,228 --> 00:43:26,435
Now, undress. Start with the shoes.

386
00:43:29,652 --> 00:43:31,692
Want to see me cut him, huh?

387
00:43:57,813 --> 00:43:59,687
The stockings.

388
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,967
Get up.

389
00:44:29,604 --> 00:44:31,893
That shirt thing now. Peel it off.

390
00:44:50,046 --> 00:44:53,214
I don't have to tell you what's next, do I?

391
00:45:03,105 --> 00:45:05,312
Come on. Come on!

392
00:45:21,628 --> 00:45:24,832
How are you enjoying this, cousin? Huh?

393
00:45:24,924 --> 00:45:29,753
Is this supposed to get you even
for losing that train today?

394
00:45:29,847 --> 00:45:32,386
- Get that petticoat off!
- Coaley!

395
00:45:34,019 --> 00:45:36,059
Come over here.

396
00:45:37,899 --> 00:45:39,310
Now!

397
00:45:52,835 --> 00:45:54,828
(Dock) What happened at that train?

398
00:45:54,921 --> 00:45:58,622
I told you.
A guard with a.44 was cutting us down.

399
00:45:58,717 --> 00:46:00,545
I told you before.

400
00:46:04,850 --> 00:46:06,890
Go to sleep.

401
00:46:07,896 --> 00:46:09,474
All of you!

402
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:27,325
(Laughs)

403
00:46:27,421 --> 00:46:29,710
He's a good boy, Coaley.

404
00:46:32,761 --> 00:46:35,050
Just a little too much fire.

405
00:46:37,642 --> 00:46:39,718
I'm still running the show, Link.

406
00:46:39,811 --> 00:46:42,350
I just like to prove it once in a while.

407
00:46:43,274 --> 00:46:45,066
She's mine.

408
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:50,272
I want you back, Link,
but I want it the way it used to be.

409
00:46:52,035 --> 00:46:53,863
She's mine, Dock.

410
00:47:01,547 --> 00:47:03,587
It's all filled in.

411
00:47:09,724 --> 00:47:11,931
You can sleep in the barn, Link.

412
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:19,478
And take your woman with you!

413
00:47:38,970 --> 00:47:41,841
- Are you all right?
- You?

414
00:47:48,691 --> 00:47:50,814
I don't know how this can happen.

415
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:54,656
When he...
When he took out that knife...

416
00:47:56,618 --> 00:47:59,074
I don't even remember what I did.

417
00:48:00,498 --> 00:48:02,906
I couldn't see their faces any more.

418
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,960
But I could feel that old man.

419
00:48:10,594 --> 00:48:13,299
How could you have been with him?

420
00:48:13,389 --> 00:48:15,429
You're not like them.

421
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:19,637
I was. There wasn't any difference at all.

422
00:48:23,736 --> 00:48:25,978
You better try and get some sleep.

423
00:48:28,074 --> 00:48:30,317
Link, here are some blankets.

424
00:48:45,847 --> 00:48:47,674
My bag!

425
00:48:51,646 --> 00:48:53,805
What are you looking for?

426
00:48:53,899 --> 00:48:56,770
I could cut off my arm.
All that money and...

427
00:48:56,861 --> 00:48:58,819
it wasn't even mine.

428
00:48:58,905 --> 00:49:02,441
It belonged to a lot of poor people,
and they trusted me.

429
00:49:02,535 --> 00:49:06,071
It took them years to save it, and now...

430
00:49:06,165 --> 00:49:08,205
and now it's gone.

431
00:49:22,936 --> 00:49:25,772
What's going to happen to us tomorrow?

432
00:49:26,899 --> 00:49:29,023
I don't know. It doesn't matter.

433
00:49:29,903 --> 00:49:33,569
I can't ever go home
unless I get that money back.

434
00:49:39,499 --> 00:49:41,907
(Dock) Link!

435
00:49:42,002 --> 00:49:44,291
(Dock laughing)

436
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:46,420
Get under these blankets.

437
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:03,651
(Dock) Link!

438
00:50:08,786 --> 00:50:11,076
Hey, Link!

439
00:50:14,502 --> 00:50:17,457
Where are you? Huh?

440
00:50:19,049 --> 00:50:21,339
Thought I'd pay you a little visit.

441
00:50:23,263 --> 00:50:25,422
Link?

442
00:50:31,273 --> 00:50:34,358
(Laughing)

443
00:50:37,573 --> 00:50:40,824
I got to thinking about you two
and how cold it was.

444
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:45,287
You know how the wind
whistles through here. Drink?

445
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:48,126
- We're all right.
- Yeah...

446
00:50:49,505 --> 00:50:52,044
Sure you are. Sure.

447
00:50:54,887 --> 00:50:58,720
A woman like that
ought to be sleeping in a house.

448
00:50:58,808 --> 00:51:00,718
Isn't that right, Link?

449
00:51:01,687 --> 00:51:03,312
She stays here.

450
00:51:03,398 --> 00:51:06,185
(Laughs)

451
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,067
All right, Link.

452
00:51:12,159 --> 00:51:15,160
(Laughing)

453
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:35,469
(Billie sobs)

454
00:52:15,948 --> 00:52:17,823
(Door opens)

455
00:52:33,721 --> 00:52:36,177
Claude! (Laughs)

456
00:52:36,266 --> 00:52:38,259
Good to see you.

457
00:52:38,352 --> 00:52:40,345
What happened to the train?

458
00:52:40,438 --> 00:52:42,478
- We missed it.
- Who did?

459
00:52:42,566 --> 00:52:44,773
Coaley.

460
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:48,480
- You know who I heard was on that train?
- Ah.

461
00:52:48,573 --> 00:52:51,279
That's right. He's here.

462
00:53:10,935 --> 00:53:14,685
You better get ready.
They'll be coming for us.

463
00:53:14,773 --> 00:53:16,814
Link.

464
00:53:22,533 --> 00:53:25,405
I never met a man like you before.

465
00:53:26,997 --> 00:53:28,706
The men I meet

466
00:53:28,791 --> 00:53:32,742
all think they have a right
to put their hands on me.

467
00:53:32,838 --> 00:53:35,246
Like it comes with the introduction.

468
00:53:38,053 --> 00:53:42,930
All those Ionely ones,
looking for some kind of special thrill...

469
00:53:44,061 --> 00:53:47,395
I know what they're gonna say
before they say it.

470
00:53:48,525 --> 00:53:53,817
Funny part is, inside me,
I'm just as Ionely as they are.

471
00:53:55,367 --> 00:53:57,325
I don't really have anybody.

472
00:53:58,579 --> 00:54:00,656
We're a lot alike.

473
00:54:00,749 --> 00:54:04,582
I never had any family -
just that old man down there,

474
00:54:04,670 --> 00:54:07,127
and he took care of me.

475
00:54:07,215 --> 00:54:11,629
He taught me killing and stealing,
and I didn't know any better.

476
00:54:13,348 --> 00:54:15,092
Then one day, I grew up.

477
00:54:15,184 --> 00:54:19,812
You either become a human being
or rot like that bunch.

478
00:54:20,399 --> 00:54:22,439
So I busted away.

479
00:54:24,029 --> 00:54:26,069
I found something better.

480
00:54:27,950 --> 00:54:29,990
I made myself a home.

481
00:54:32,539 --> 00:54:34,449
You have a wife?

482
00:54:34,542 --> 00:54:35,823
Yes.

483
00:54:37,254 --> 00:54:39,710
- Children?
- Yes.

484
00:54:41,092 --> 00:54:44,758
- How old?
- Eight and ten.

485
00:54:46,599 --> 00:54:48,758
Eight and ten.

486
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:52,559
Your wife, is she pretty?

487
00:54:52,648 --> 00:54:54,060
Yes.

488
00:54:56,153 --> 00:54:57,980
She's lucky.

489
00:55:04,705 --> 00:55:06,663
You better get dressed.

490
00:55:22,937 --> 00:55:26,022
Come on, now! Load up there!

491
00:55:26,108 --> 00:55:28,979
Come on. Shake a leg! Move!

492
00:55:30,155 --> 00:55:33,738
Look at them, Claude.
Like old times, isn't it?

493
00:55:34,994 --> 00:55:37,568
We're gonna do big things. I feel it.

494
00:55:37,664 --> 00:55:42,078
Glory be to God, we're going
to bust out again like we used to.

495
00:55:42,170 --> 00:55:44,293
(Laughs)

496
00:55:44,381 --> 00:55:47,632
Just like a family of old settlers
moving on, huh?

497
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:53,299
Say hello to your cousin Link.

498
00:56:04,532 --> 00:56:07,818
It was like tearing them away
from a honeymoon.

499
00:56:07,911 --> 00:56:10,237
Claude.

500
00:56:10,331 --> 00:56:12,158
You've changed.

501
00:56:14,795 --> 00:56:17,417
This is Miss Billie Ellis. Claude Tobin.

502
00:56:18,049 --> 00:56:19,212
Hello.

503
00:56:19,301 --> 00:56:21,673
Claude, tell them what happened.

504
00:56:23,514 --> 00:56:25,923
That train you were on yesterday

505
00:56:27,019 --> 00:56:29,261
made a special stop at Eskota.

506
00:56:29,355 --> 00:56:32,143
They began burning up
the telegraph wires.

507
00:56:32,234 --> 00:56:34,986
A marshal in Crosscut saw you getting on.

508
00:56:35,863 --> 00:56:38,569
You must have looked familiar,

509
00:56:38,659 --> 00:56:42,788
so he started poking through
some real old wanted posters.

510
00:56:42,872 --> 00:56:44,533
He found yours.

511
00:56:45,417 --> 00:56:47,707
It's up again all over Crosscut.

512
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:51,591
On account of you,
they know who we are.

513
00:56:52,885 --> 00:56:55,341
I want to thank you for that.

514
00:56:56,556 --> 00:56:59,428
Well, I guess this is your home now, Link.

515
00:57:00,478 --> 00:57:04,347
Dock, I want to talk to you over here.
Coaley.

516
00:57:27,554 --> 00:57:30,509
Where I live, all the people know about me,

517
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:33,602
about what I did
when I was with that old man.

518
00:57:34,271 --> 00:57:37,724
They know everything,
and they let me live it down.

519
00:57:37,817 --> 00:57:40,143
It took a long, hard time,

520
00:57:42,365 --> 00:57:44,821
and now I've got to do it again.

521
00:57:45,786 --> 00:57:50,164
You know what I feel inside of me?
I feel like killing.

522
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:52,920
I want to kill every one of those Tobins,

523
00:57:53,754 --> 00:57:55,961
and that makes me just like them.

524
00:57:56,591 --> 00:58:00,590
What I busted my back
all those years trying not to be.

525
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,242
Do you know what they're talking about?

526
00:58:25,336 --> 00:58:27,958
The new one and Coaley, they want to...

527
00:58:28,048 --> 00:58:29,673
Quiet.

528
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:31,419
Shut up.

529
00:58:31,511 --> 00:58:33,800
We've got a lot of ground to cover.

530
00:58:33,889 --> 00:58:36,974
- They'll just slow us down.
- That's right.

531
00:58:38,687 --> 00:58:40,596
I say we open them up.

532
00:58:40,689 --> 00:58:42,682
That's what I say. Open them up.

533
00:58:45,237 --> 00:58:47,146
What about the girl?

534
00:58:48,908 --> 00:58:52,076
- We'll take care of her too.
- Claude.

535
00:58:53,539 --> 00:58:55,781
This is still my outfit.

536
00:58:55,875 --> 00:58:57,999
Link's back, and he's staying.

537
00:59:01,007 --> 00:59:02,585
Get in the wagon.

538
00:59:03,176 --> 00:59:08,338
- Dock, do you believe him?
- I don't know what I believe.

539
00:59:08,892 --> 00:59:11,597
I'm going to find out before I get home.

540
00:59:13,398 --> 00:59:16,068
You and Link are taking us into Lassoo.

541
00:59:17,444 --> 00:59:20,115
- Lassoo?
- That's what I said.

542
00:59:21,366 --> 00:59:24,902
Lassoo or no Lassoo,
I say we kill them and move on.

543
00:59:24,996 --> 00:59:27,072
I'm for that. Let's do it.

544
00:59:38,889 --> 00:59:40,929
Get in the wagon.

545
00:59:53,365 --> 00:59:55,987
All right, let's get 'em rolling!

546
00:59:56,077 --> 00:59:57,904
Come on, Link!

547
01:00:54,568 --> 01:00:56,608
Whoa!

548
01:00:58,573 --> 01:01:01,030
I want to stop here for a while.

549
01:01:01,828 --> 01:01:05,162
We're going to roll all night
and all day tomorrow.

550
01:01:17,014 --> 01:01:19,885
There's a secret to this thing, Ponch.

551
01:01:19,976 --> 01:01:23,096
You want to learn,
you've come to the right man.

552
01:01:23,188 --> 01:01:26,190
You got a lot of bloodshot around the eye!

553
01:01:26,275 --> 01:01:28,019
Don't strain so.

554
01:01:30,197 --> 01:01:34,825
Just listen to old Dock,
and you'll find out the...

555
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,955
You let the other man's
strength beat him.

556
01:01:42,797 --> 01:01:45,751
Right, Link? You want to try next?

557
01:01:46,885 --> 01:01:49,555
Why don't you let Coaley try first?

558
01:01:52,392 --> 01:01:57,020
He might give you a little tussle
if you let him use his knife.

559
01:01:57,106 --> 01:01:59,147
(Laughs)

560
01:02:00,569 --> 01:02:03,524
Ah, you got a real sharp
sense of humour.

561
01:02:03,615 --> 01:02:07,566
Yeah. I was about to say
the same thing myself, cousin.

562
01:02:07,662 --> 01:02:12,705
And I think he might appreciate it
if you'd let him use that gun, too.

563
01:02:14,086 --> 01:02:16,543
He's got his juices flowing now.

564
01:02:17,758 --> 01:02:20,925
- Look at him!
- All right, say it all.

565
01:02:21,012 --> 01:02:22,886
If you wanted to make it even

566
01:02:22,973 --> 01:02:27,351
you could let him
come up on you from behind.

567
01:02:27,437 --> 01:02:29,726
Let's see you do it, Coaley.

568
01:02:48,505 --> 01:02:50,083
Turn around.

569
01:02:51,009 --> 01:02:54,461
I want him to be comfortable.
Let's do it your way.

570
01:04:21,541 --> 01:04:23,166
How's that feel, cousin?

571
01:05:15,485 --> 01:05:18,107
(Horses whinny)

572
01:05:53,116 --> 01:05:56,201
Now I'm gonna undress you, Coaley.

573
01:05:56,287 --> 01:05:59,573
That's what you said to her, isn't it?

574
01:06:09,846 --> 01:06:12,551
(Coaley yells)

575
01:06:12,641 --> 01:06:15,761
Isn't that what you said to her?
Boots first.

576
01:06:29,788 --> 01:06:31,828
(Coaley yelling)

577
01:06:45,558 --> 01:06:49,224
(Coaley) I'm gonna kill you!

578
01:06:52,108 --> 01:06:55,644
- How does it feel, huh?
- I'm gonna kill you!

579
01:06:57,698 --> 01:06:59,738
Take the clothes off.

580
01:07:01,954 --> 01:07:03,994
Take your clothes off.

581
01:07:24,149 --> 01:07:26,308
I can't.

582
01:07:27,528 --> 01:07:29,568
I can't do it.

583
01:07:38,459 --> 01:07:42,588
Well, I never saw anything
like that in all my life.

584
01:07:44,466 --> 01:07:47,801
Link, that was something
to make an old man's blood boil.

585
01:07:47,887 --> 01:07:50,806
I thought you were gonna
choke him to death!

586
01:07:50,891 --> 01:07:53,679
Just like the old days in Uvalde.

587
01:07:53,770 --> 01:07:56,855
Did you see him rip the clothes off him?

588
01:07:56,941 --> 01:08:00,560
Kill him! I'm gonna kill him!

589
01:08:00,654 --> 01:08:03,608
- Coaley, put that down.
- I'm gonna kill him!

590
01:08:03,699 --> 01:08:05,823
I said put that down!

591
01:08:05,910 --> 01:08:08,034
I don't care what you say.

592
01:08:08,121 --> 01:08:09,700
Stop!

593
01:08:09,790 --> 01:08:12,709
You don't mean nothing to me.

594
01:08:12,794 --> 01:08:14,205
Stop it!

595
01:08:20,178 --> 01:08:22,006
I'm going to kill you, Link.

596
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:25,847
You can't make fun of me.
You can't make fun of me.

597
01:08:25,936 --> 01:08:27,728
Stop!

598
01:08:48,423 --> 01:08:51,590
I don't know what's come over me lately.

599
01:08:51,677 --> 01:08:54,963
I've never done a thing like this before.

600
01:08:55,932 --> 01:08:58,851
I mean, I don't fight
or anything like that.

601
01:09:00,647 --> 01:09:03,518
I tell you, though, it was a shrewd move.

602
01:09:05,194 --> 01:09:08,896
You see, I figured without you around here

603
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:11,114
they'd have killed me for sure.

604
01:09:11,202 --> 01:09:13,990
I'd have laid three, four to one on that.

605
01:09:15,541 --> 01:09:18,246
So I... So I just...

606
01:10:01,808 --> 01:10:03,967
Don't you talk any more, Claude?

607
01:10:05,313 --> 01:10:08,398
We used to talk, you and me,
when we were kids.

608
01:10:08,483 --> 01:10:09,978
What happened?

609
01:10:12,697 --> 01:10:15,865
Things have kind of gone to hell,
haven't they?

610
01:10:15,951 --> 01:10:19,617
And you're still at it.
Stealing and killing and running.

611
01:10:20,832 --> 01:10:22,873
That's right.

612
01:10:23,669 --> 01:10:26,126
It doesn't make any sense.

613
01:10:26,214 --> 01:10:28,587
I figured you'd have grown out of it.

614
01:10:28,676 --> 01:10:31,381
How can you let
that old man do this to you?

615
01:10:31,471 --> 01:10:33,215
He's out of his mind.

616
01:10:33,307 --> 01:10:36,059
Don't you talk about that old man.

617
01:10:36,144 --> 01:10:38,980
I been with him all my life.
He's my family.

618
01:10:40,441 --> 01:10:43,396
Yeah, he's going
a little soft in the head,

619
01:10:43,486 --> 01:10:45,859
but I can say that. You can't.

620
01:10:45,948 --> 01:10:48,190
You got no rights here no more.

621
01:10:49,452 --> 01:10:54,365
I'll tell you, I prayed
for him to let Coaley kill you,

622
01:10:54,459 --> 01:10:58,410
but he didn't. He just don't
see things so clear no more.

623
01:10:59,715 --> 01:11:03,548
Years ago, nobody could have done
what you're trying to do now.

624
01:11:03,637 --> 01:11:06,805
Not even you. He would have
known it in ten seconds

625
01:11:06,891 --> 01:11:08,931
and blown your head off in 20.

626
01:11:11,188 --> 01:11:14,024
- You like it?
- I like it.

627
01:11:15,277 --> 01:11:17,400
- Claude...
- Will you shut up?

628
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:21,649
Do you know what he did
the day you left?

629
01:11:21,743 --> 01:11:25,612
He cried. That's right. I saw him.

630
01:11:26,708 --> 01:11:28,997
Big tears running down his face.

631
01:11:30,463 --> 01:11:33,999
Now you're back and trying
to make him think it's for real.

632
01:11:34,093 --> 01:11:36,252
He wants that so bad it hurts him.

633
01:11:37,222 --> 01:11:39,594
Well, you ain't got me fooled.

634
01:11:40,392 --> 01:11:42,848
You see, I watch out for that old man.

635
01:11:43,646 --> 01:11:46,648
I love him, and I watch out for him.

636
01:11:49,737 --> 01:11:51,814
You're not gonna make it, Link.

637
01:11:52,491 --> 01:11:56,704
I swear that. You're not gonna make it.

638
01:12:23,113 --> 01:12:25,570
Go on!

639
01:12:52,442 --> 01:12:54,815
Tomorrow morning, we hit Lassoo.

640
01:12:57,699 --> 01:13:01,780
I've been looking off into the dark,
and I saw the job happening.

641
01:13:01,871 --> 01:13:04,541
It made me feel so cold,

642
01:13:04,625 --> 01:13:07,876
I thought I was standing in ice water
up to my neck.

643
01:13:09,923 --> 01:13:12,593
I saw all there was in Lassoo...

644
01:13:13,678 --> 01:13:16,300
100 yards of shacks and dust

645
01:13:17,683 --> 01:13:21,349
with the Stageline bank at the end of it.

646
01:13:21,438 --> 01:13:23,478
Ha!

647
01:13:23,566 --> 01:13:26,022
There's more money in the Lassoo bank

648
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:29,148
any of you ignorant dogs ever could count!

649
01:13:32,869 --> 01:13:36,156
Now, listen to me. Got this in front of me.

650
01:13:38,501 --> 01:13:41,456
Tomorrow morning,
a man rides into the bank.

651
01:13:41,547 --> 01:13:44,632
He carries a satchel with him. He's polite...

652
01:13:45,761 --> 01:13:47,920
quiet.

653
01:13:48,013 --> 01:13:51,181
Asks them at the bank
to hold the satchel for him.

654
01:13:52,769 --> 01:13:55,344
Then he thanks them, and he goes out,

655
01:13:56,441 --> 01:13:58,897
and he knows who's in the bank,

656
01:13:58,986 --> 01:14:02,190
how many guns they've got,
whether we can take it or not.

657
01:14:04,660 --> 01:14:06,487
Now, listen to me good.

658
01:14:07,747 --> 01:14:10,702
If we can take it, he waits there for us.

659
01:14:10,792 --> 01:14:12,833
If we can't, he rides back.

660
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:17,418
If he's not back in four hours,
we know he's waiting for us,

661
01:14:17,509 --> 01:14:19,337
and we ride in.

662
01:14:21,139 --> 01:14:23,631
He meets us outside the town,

663
01:14:23,726 --> 01:14:26,051
lays the whole thing out for us.

664
01:14:26,145 --> 01:14:29,183
We go in, blow the place to bits.

665
01:14:30,109 --> 01:14:34,986
We ride out of there rich,
fat, laughing like babies!

666
01:14:36,826 --> 01:14:40,160
There's nothing to forget
and nothing to go wrong.

667
01:14:40,247 --> 01:14:42,454
Nothing to mess up.

668
01:14:43,584 --> 01:14:46,456
All it takes to make this work is guts.

669
01:14:47,798 --> 01:14:50,206
Who's got 'em?

670
01:14:50,301 --> 01:14:52,341
Which man rides in first?

671
01:14:54,056 --> 01:14:56,298
I do.

672
01:14:57,894 --> 01:14:59,305
Why you, Link?

673
01:15:09,284 --> 01:15:11,740
Who else is there?

674
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:15,536
Trout? He can't talk.

675
01:15:19,505 --> 01:15:21,379
Ponch?

676
01:15:21,466 --> 01:15:25,002
He can't think. You wouldn't
send him on a man's job.

677
01:15:28,809 --> 01:15:32,060
Claude, how many years
you been riding this territory?

678
01:15:32,146 --> 01:15:35,231
They know your face in Lassoo,
don't they?

679
01:15:35,317 --> 01:15:37,357
Don't they, Claude?

680
01:15:39,155 --> 01:15:42,406
And you couldn't ride
five steps into that town.

681
01:15:42,493 --> 01:15:45,613
They'd be lined up
waiting to crack you down.

682
01:15:46,373 --> 01:15:48,081
So that leaves me.

683
01:15:53,757 --> 01:15:57,209
All right, Link. You ride in first.

684
01:16:02,894 --> 01:16:05,136
You take Trout along with you.

685
01:16:06,732 --> 01:16:08,772
I'm going in alone.

686
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:12,064
Being with Trout is like being alone.

687
01:16:18,414 --> 01:16:22,662
You start out at sunup.
Ponch and Claude go in at noon.

688
01:16:50,454 --> 01:16:52,198
What will you do?

689
01:16:52,290 --> 01:16:56,123
I don't know. We'll have to
wait and see what happens.

690
01:17:07,142 --> 01:17:09,219
You know, it's funny, Link.

691
01:17:10,981 --> 01:17:15,893
The last two days, you've lost
everything you've ever lived for,

692
01:17:15,987 --> 01:17:19,072
and I've found something
I wanted all my life.

693
01:17:26,459 --> 01:17:28,666
I love touching you...

694
01:17:32,258 --> 01:17:36,470
but what hurts is that I can't keep
what I've found, can I?

695
01:17:38,766 --> 01:17:40,475
Can I, Link?

696
01:17:42,062 --> 01:17:45,064
You don't have to ask me that, do you?

697
01:17:47,778 --> 01:17:50,732
You know what I'll say.

698
01:17:50,823 --> 01:17:52,900
Yes, I know.

699
01:17:54,703 --> 01:17:58,322
If we stay alive
and you get the money back,

700
01:17:58,416 --> 01:18:00,290
then you'll go home.

701
01:18:01,587 --> 01:18:03,461
Won't you, Link?

702
01:18:05,342 --> 01:18:07,169
Yeah.

703
01:18:27,954 --> 01:18:30,659
After you leave the bank...

704
01:18:30,749 --> 01:18:32,576
kill him.

705
01:18:47,479 --> 01:18:49,686
You look good up there, Link.

706
01:18:49,773 --> 01:18:51,731
That's where you belong.

707
01:18:53,778 --> 01:18:56,531
I'd give my eyes to go on this one.

708
01:18:56,615 --> 01:18:58,739
If it was ten years back, I'd...

709
01:19:02,039 --> 01:19:03,949
Get out of here.

710
01:19:04,042 --> 01:19:07,209
If anything happens to the girl
when I'm away...

711
01:19:08,964 --> 01:19:11,005
Do you hear me, Dock?

712
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:13,883
Nothing's gonna happen, Link.

713
01:20:07,706 --> 01:20:09,746
So this is Lassoo.

714
01:21:42,076 --> 01:21:45,244
Who are you? Please, go out.

715
01:21:45,331 --> 01:21:49,412
Lady, we just wanted to leave
some money at the bank here.

716
01:21:49,503 --> 01:21:52,339
There's no bank here.
There's nothing here.

717
01:21:52,423 --> 01:21:55,875
Just me and my husband.
Please, vayase. Go.

718
01:21:55,969 --> 01:21:59,173
- Where's everybody gone to?
- I don't know.

719
01:21:59,265 --> 01:22:02,967
They build a new stagecoach place
when the mines close.

720
01:22:03,062 --> 01:22:05,269
Everybody's gone. I don't know.

721
01:22:05,356 --> 01:22:08,311
I'm afraid! Please, go back! Please!

722
01:22:08,402 --> 01:22:10,728
Lady, we're not going to hurt you!

723
01:22:52,875 --> 01:22:54,952
(Trout howls)

724
01:26:28,442 --> 01:26:30,067
Link!

725
01:26:39,122 --> 01:26:41,614
I want to see you, cousin!

726
01:26:41,709 --> 01:26:43,832
Over here, cousin!

727
01:27:53,634 --> 01:27:55,841
We're gonna kill you, Link!

728
01:27:57,472 --> 01:28:01,637
- That's a promise!
- You sound a little shaky, Claude.

729
01:28:01,727 --> 01:28:03,555
Are you nervous?

730
01:29:31,258 --> 01:29:33,133
Agh!

731
01:29:59,878 --> 01:30:01,918
Claude?

732
01:30:03,383 --> 01:30:05,423
Claude, where are you?

733
01:30:12,895 --> 01:30:14,722
All alone now, Claude...

734
01:30:16,983 --> 01:30:18,811
Just you and me.

735
01:30:20,446 --> 01:30:22,486
My leg...

736
01:30:23,742 --> 01:30:25,782
My leg's gone!

737
01:30:30,709 --> 01:30:32,833
You got to come to me, Link!

738
01:30:38,427 --> 01:30:40,753
This is the moment, Claude.

739
01:30:41,890 --> 01:30:44,596
You've been planning for it all your life.

740
01:30:44,685 --> 01:30:46,762
Now it's finally here.

741
01:30:48,315 --> 01:30:50,985
Just like you knew it always would be.

742
01:30:56,117 --> 01:30:58,489
You got to come to me!

743
01:31:12,721 --> 01:31:14,845
It could have been so different.

744
01:31:17,477 --> 01:31:19,351
You coming, Link?

745
01:31:29,910 --> 01:31:32,282
(Gunshots)

746
01:32:52,557 --> 01:32:54,597
Senor, que paso?

747
01:32:57,521 --> 01:32:59,479
I'm sorry.

748
01:33:06,658 --> 01:33:08,069
Juanita.

749
01:33:09,787 --> 01:33:13,287
Juanita. Mi Juanita.

750
01:33:19,967 --> 01:33:22,007
(Sobbing) Mi Juanita.

751
01:34:27,052 --> 01:34:29,092
Billie.

752
01:34:32,726 --> 01:34:34,766
Billie.

753
01:34:37,482 --> 01:34:40,021
Link.

754
01:34:40,111 --> 01:34:43,646
Link... Link.

755
01:34:47,954 --> 01:34:51,288
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

756
01:34:53,169 --> 01:34:55,209
(Dock) Link!

757
01:34:56,757 --> 01:34:58,833
Link, where are they?

758
01:35:00,804 --> 01:35:02,631
They're dead!

759
01:35:06,853 --> 01:35:09,689
- You killed them all?
- I killed 'em!

760
01:35:11,776 --> 01:35:14,897
Claude? You killed Claude?

761
01:35:15,447 --> 01:35:17,441
Yes! Claude!

762
01:35:18,410 --> 01:35:22,029
I'm coming to get you, Dock!
I'm gonna take you in!

763
01:35:51,577 --> 01:35:53,285
Dock!

764
01:35:53,913 --> 01:35:56,369
Listen to me, Dock!

765
01:35:56,458 --> 01:36:00,671
Claude and Ponch and Trout
are lying in the street at Lassoo.

766
01:36:01,131 --> 01:36:02,958
Lassoo's a ghost town,

767
01:36:03,050 --> 01:36:06,550
and that's what you are, Dock, a ghost.

768
01:36:07,305 --> 01:36:10,260
You've outlived your kind
and your time,

769
01:36:10,351 --> 01:36:12,391
and I'm coming to get you!

770
01:36:15,023 --> 01:36:16,851
All right, shoot me!

771
01:36:17,902 --> 01:36:20,441
I got no one left any more!

772
01:36:21,323 --> 01:36:23,363
Go ahead and shoot me!

773
01:36:26,288 --> 01:36:28,577
I'm gonna take you in, Dock.

774
01:36:29,625 --> 01:36:32,331
You lost your taste for it!

775
01:36:33,172 --> 01:36:35,580
You don't like it any more!

776
01:36:36,175 --> 01:36:38,169
Shoot me!

777
01:36:38,261 --> 01:36:40,053
Come on!

778
01:36:40,139 --> 01:36:42,346
Shoot! Shoot!

779
01:36:43,727 --> 01:36:45,305
Shoot!

780
01:38:02,661 --> 01:38:05,069
They'll probably give you a medal.

781
01:38:10,170 --> 01:38:12,413
What are you going to do now?

782
01:38:14,634 --> 01:38:16,924
What I always do, sing.

783
01:38:20,350 --> 01:38:22,177
- Billie...
- Link.

784
01:38:24,355 --> 01:38:28,306
I never loved anybody or anything
in my whole life before.

785
01:38:29,653 --> 01:38:32,904
I always wondered what it felt like.
Now I know.

786
01:38:33,992 --> 01:38:36,069
I know there's no hope for us.

787
01:38:37,455 --> 01:38:39,911
But I wouldn't change this feeling,

788
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,040
not for anything.
