our last job, Brian.

Former major in the S.A.S.,
Spec-ops soldier.

He ran the UK's Mobility Division
in Kabul and Basra.

Ah, damn.
That Mobility unit's the truth.

to a whole new level.

You're a millionaire,

That's how you
stay a millionaire.

225

So what does
this all mean?

226
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:28,715
Well, our best guess is
that Shaw's crew

227
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,842
is building
a Nightshade device.

228
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:32,677
- Which is?
- A tech bomb.

Designed to block
an entire military communication grid

for 24 hours.

231
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,558
If you blind a soldier
for a single second

232
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:40,268
in the middle of a fight,
he dies.

233

If you blind
a country for 24 hours,

234
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:44,689
the loss of life
is unthinkable.

235
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:47,734
This could be worth billions
to the right buyer.

on what Shaw's crew
grabbed from Interpol.

There are over
two dozen of them around Europe.

But the list is
only good for 96 hours.

Father, we give thanks
for all the choices we've made,

02:01:07,100 --> 02:01:09,686
because that's what
makes us who we are.

Let us forever cherish the loved ones
we've lost along the way.
