1
00:01:42,049 --> 00:01:43,884
I'm so worried for that boy.

2
00:01:45,886 --> 00:01:47,262
Joe's going to be okay.

3
00:01:48,472 --> 00:01:49,973
She was everything to him.

4
00:01:51,683 --> 00:01:52,893
Jack's going to step up.

5
00:01:53,101 --> 00:01:54,061
He's a good man.

6
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,105
But he has never had
to be a father before.

7
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,818
I don't think he understands Joe.

8
00:02:05,197 --> 00:02:06,740
How long had she work there?

9
00:02:06,823 --> 00:02:09,117
Five years?
- I think it was six.

10
00:02:09,784 --> 00:02:10,911
What do you think was in the coffin?

11
00:02:11,286 --> 00:02:12,787
Jesus, shut up.

12
00:02:13,079 --> 00:02:14,956
I was thinking how she died.

13
00:02:15,832 --> 00:02:17,083
You guys weren't wondering that.

14
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:19,252
No, I'm eating macaroni salad.

15
00:02:19,252 --> 00:02:20,295
I was wondering about that too.

16
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:22,213
I heard it crushed her completely.

17
00:02:22,339 --> 00:02:23,256
Steel beams.

18
00:02:23,256 --> 00:02:24,466
Those things weigh a ton.

19
00:02:24,466 --> 00:02:25,550
Literally.

20
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,968
I don't know how you guys can eat.

21
00:02:26,968 --> 00:02:28,678
Try the turkey and you'll discover how.

22
00:02:28,678 --> 00:02:29,846
Lucy, down.

23
00:02:29,971 --> 00:02:30,513
Get out.

24
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:32,348
Joe.

25
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:33,641
Have you seen Joe?

26
00:02:33,683 --> 00:02:35,602
Bet Joe's not going to want
to do my movie anymore.

27
00:02:35,935 --> 00:02:36,770
Why?

28
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:37,770
Why do you think why?

29
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,814
The story is about the living dead.

30
00:02:39,814 --> 00:02:41,399
His mum is not a zombie.

31
00:02:41,399 --> 00:02:42,859
But she's dead, shit head.

32
00:02:42,901 --> 00:02:44,861
It's troubled his heart pretty good.
- Told you.

33
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,228
Get him out of here!

34
00:03:19,645 --> 00:03:21,022
Just wait a minute.

35
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:22,440
Wait!

36
00:03:24,025 --> 00:03:25,192
Jack!

37
00:03:25,192 --> 00:03:26,569
Jack, just let me out!

38
00:03:26,569 --> 00:03:27,570
Get out!

39
00:03:28,362 --> 00:03:29,363
Get out!

40
00:03:29,363 --> 00:03:30,781
Hey Jack!

41
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,494
It was a mistake.

42
00:03:36,078 --> 00:03:37,371
Get out! Come on!

43
00:03:42,084 --> 00:03:43,085
Get in!

44
00:03:49,091 --> 00:03:50,801
Joseph, I will be home soon.

45
00:04:29,047 --> 00:04:31,258
Oh my God. That was
the longest day ever.

46
00:04:31,675 --> 00:04:33,177
Here.
- What's this?

47
00:04:33,177 --> 00:04:34,803
New scene. Check it out.

48
00:04:35,095 --> 00:04:36,805
Detective Hathaway has a wife now?

49
00:04:36,805 --> 00:04:38,932
I don't know. I think it
might make a better movie.

50
00:04:38,932 --> 00:04:41,059
I need a better story
line and production value.

51
00:04:41,101 --> 00:04:43,103
Hey guys. Martin...

52
00:04:43,103 --> 00:04:44,229
It was the grosses one yet.

53
00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:45,897
Oh my god, shut up!

54
00:04:45,897 --> 00:04:47,482
So who's going to play the wife?
Jen?

55
00:04:47,566 --> 00:04:49,776
No way. I told you what
she did to my top pack.

56
00:04:49,776 --> 00:04:51,486
What wife?
- Alice Dainard.

57
00:04:53,405 --> 00:04:55,907
I was returning that book
on 'Codes and Ciphers'.

58
00:04:55,907 --> 00:04:57,492
She was in the silent reading section.

59
00:04:57,617 --> 00:04:59,745
And I asked her if she'll
play Hathaway's wife.

60
00:05:00,036 --> 00:05:02,122
Wait. You talked to
Alice Dainard, really?

61
00:05:02,122 --> 00:05:04,207
You aren't suppose to talk at
all in the silent reading section.

62
00:05:04,207 --> 00:05:05,792
Shut up.
- It's for silent reading.

63
00:05:05,792 --> 00:05:06,543
She said 'yes'.

64
00:05:06,543 --> 00:05:09,004
We're filming tonight and she's driving.

65
00:05:09,421 --> 00:05:11,631
Driving? Driving where?

66
00:05:32,444 --> 00:05:34,612
That was a really good zombie murder.

67
00:05:34,612 --> 00:05:35,822
But it's not a story yet.

68
00:05:36,281 --> 00:05:38,366
All the kids that are
entering this film festival,

69
00:05:38,366 --> 00:05:39,784
fifteen and sixteen years old,

70
00:05:39,784 --> 00:05:41,494
have better stories and

71
00:05:42,537 --> 00:05:44,539
casts and production value.

72
00:05:44,539 --> 00:05:45,832
I've got nothing.
- Charles, dinner.

73
00:05:45,832 --> 00:05:47,208
I'm coming.

74
00:05:48,209 --> 00:05:49,919
There is this article
I want you to read this.

75
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,171
It explains everything about stories.

76
00:05:52,422 --> 00:05:55,258
I just don't understand how
the wife helps make it a story.

77
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,926
Jesus, what have I been explaining?

78
00:05:56,968 --> 00:05:58,803
The scene we're filming
tonight, where the

79
00:05:58,803 --> 00:06:01,973
wife's telling the detective that
she cares for him, that she loves him.

80
00:06:02,015 --> 00:06:03,433
I can't believe you
talk to Alice Dainard.

81
00:06:03,433 --> 00:06:04,851
Charles, come on, move it!

82
00:06:04,851 --> 00:06:06,227
I'm coming!

83
00:06:07,353 --> 00:06:08,896
And watch your head this time!

84
00:06:08,938 --> 00:06:10,732
So when he investigates
the zombie stuff,

85
00:06:11,315 --> 00:06:12,358
you feel something.

86
00:06:12,358 --> 00:06:14,819
You don't want him to die
because they love each other.

87
00:06:15,027 --> 00:06:16,070
Make sense?

88
00:06:16,195 --> 00:06:18,489
Alice Dainard, that's awesome.

89
00:06:18,739 --> 00:06:20,950
You're impossible.
- Charles, now!

90
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:23,119
God mum! I'm coming!

91
00:06:23,953 --> 00:06:25,705
Midnight okay? Don't forget.

92
00:06:25,705 --> 00:06:26,914
I won't forget.

93
00:06:26,914 --> 00:06:28,332
Read this.

94
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:30,376
It's not fair I cannot go to Wendy's.

95
00:06:30,376 --> 00:06:32,086
Every single person
will be there except me.

96
00:06:32,086 --> 00:06:34,088
Well then, every single
person and tell you how it was.

97
00:06:34,088 --> 00:06:35,506
Move the puzzle, get the napkins.

98
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,216
Mum...
- It's your turn to babysit.

99
00:06:37,216 --> 00:06:38,426
Why can't I switch with Charles?

100
00:06:38,551 --> 00:06:39,969
Maybe it's because you
crushed Charles' top pack.

101
00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:41,095
You ever think of that?

102
00:06:41,095 --> 00:06:42,430
Oh really, guess what? We're switching.

103
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,140
Oh really? Guess what? No, we're not.

104
00:06:44,181 --> 00:06:45,391
Okay, that's enough. Charles,

105
00:06:45,683 --> 00:06:46,934
take this to the table.

106
00:06:46,934 --> 00:06:48,185
Benji, time for dinner.

107
00:06:48,602 --> 00:06:49,603
Hi Joe.

108
00:06:49,812 --> 00:06:51,063
Goodnight, Mrs Kaznyk.

109
00:06:51,063 --> 00:06:52,356
Take a seat. We have lots of food.

110
00:06:52,356 --> 00:06:54,316
Oh no, I'm okay,
really. Thank you though.

111
00:06:54,984 --> 00:06:57,528
See you tomorrow, Charles.
- Later.

112
00:06:57,862 --> 00:06:59,613
There's always a place for you Joey.

113
00:06:59,613 --> 00:07:00,656
You know that.

114
00:07:01,198 --> 00:07:02,992
Yes sir, thank you.

115
00:07:18,382 --> 00:07:19,466
Dad?

116
00:07:24,722 --> 00:07:25,681
Dad?

117
00:07:42,698 --> 00:07:43,574
Hey.

118
00:07:44,575 --> 00:07:45,867
I'll be out in a minute.

119
00:07:59,631 --> 00:08:01,800
Six week program.

120
00:08:03,343 --> 00:08:05,762
Hands on training with college coaches.

121
00:08:05,971 --> 00:08:08,140
You'll like it. I know I did.

122
00:08:10,267 --> 00:08:12,060
I thought I was going to
have this summer to myself.

123
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,146
Things have obviously changed for us.

124
00:08:16,857 --> 00:08:18,567
And it will be good for
you to spend some time

125
00:08:18,567 --> 00:08:21,570
with kids who don't run around
with cameras and monster make-up.

126
00:08:25,073 --> 00:08:27,450
I have to help Charles finish his movie.

127
00:08:40,463 --> 00:08:43,800
I have got nothing against your
friends, I like your friends.

128
00:08:45,427 --> 00:08:48,555
Except for Cary who can't seem
to stop lighting things on fire.

129
00:08:51,057 --> 00:08:52,976
You'll like it there.

130
00:08:53,434 --> 00:08:55,228
It's what we both need.

131
00:09:31,347 --> 00:09:33,933
<i>Okay, it's time. Don't get caught.
Over</ i>.</i>

132
00:09:35,601 --> 00:09:37,520
<i>I won't. Over.</ i>.</i>

133
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,911
Wait guys, people are
turning into zombies

134
00:09:53,911 --> 00:09:55,871
because of the chemical Rago, right?

135
00:09:56,414 --> 00:09:58,874
I don't see how the guy
playing detective Hathaway

136
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,627
could ask where the
zombies are coming from.

137
00:10:01,961 --> 00:10:04,255
Well technically, Hathaway...

138
00:10:06,132 --> 00:10:07,758
Is that a rock?

139
00:10:11,554 --> 00:10:14,348
Hey guys look. Guys!

140
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:27,236
Hey Alice.

141
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:29,363
Joe Lamb?

142
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:30,781
Ya.

143
00:10:30,781 --> 00:10:32,491
What the hell is he doing here?

144
00:10:32,491 --> 00:10:34,284
Make-up and sound's special effects.

145
00:10:34,284 --> 00:10:35,911
He's the deputy's kid.

146
00:10:35,911 --> 00:10:37,204
So what?
- You knew that?

147
00:10:37,204 --> 00:10:39,206
Charles, I don't have a license.

148
00:10:39,289 --> 00:10:40,999
I can't drive with him.

149
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,919
You want Joe to stay back, I guess...

150
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:46,755
It's too late. He has seen
me in the car right now!

151
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:52,261
You can trust me.

152
00:10:52,678 --> 00:10:54,179
My dad will never know.

153
00:10:54,429 --> 00:10:56,556
I won't tell him anything.

154
00:11:03,814 --> 00:11:05,399
Get in.

155
00:11:07,526 --> 00:11:10,320
So I wrote a couple of
new lines. Can I show you?

156
00:11:10,362 --> 00:11:11,738
What?
- New lines?

157
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:13,824
Charles, do I have new lines?
- It will all be great.

158
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:15,867
This is if you could cry in the scene.

159
00:11:15,867 --> 00:11:16,785
Can you do that?

160
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,286
No.

161
00:11:18,286 --> 00:11:20,789
Do you know the first place I would
like to get my driving license?

162
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:22,541
Newcastle, Pennsylvania.

163
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:24,459
Wildest capital of the world.

164
00:11:39,349 --> 00:11:41,685
Guys, there's an electrical
outlet right here!

165
00:11:43,144 --> 00:11:44,104
Charles!

166
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:47,273
Charles man, do I have new lines or not?

167
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:48,400
No! No!

168
00:11:52,195 --> 00:11:54,322
Guys, this is going to be great!

169
00:11:56,157 --> 00:11:58,076
Get the lights and camera
set up from that end!

170
00:11:58,076 --> 00:11:59,202
We'll shoot this direction first.

171
00:11:59,202 --> 00:12:02,455
Joe, get the microphone and then make
sure the new batteries are in the camera

172
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:04,707
before you do the
make-up. - Okay.

173
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,294
I could afford two packs of
cherry bombs and I made my own MAE.

174
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:09,879
Do you want to see it?

175
00:12:10,213 --> 00:12:12,173
Your obsession with fireworks,

176
00:12:12,173 --> 00:12:14,008
and I'm saying this as a friend,

177
00:12:14,008 --> 00:12:16,219
concern me and my mother.

178
00:12:16,219 --> 00:12:19,180
Sweet heart, this is my
job. I have no choice.

179
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,765
It's nothing you need to worry about.

180
00:12:20,765 --> 00:12:23,101
What am I suppose to do?
Go to Michigan with you?

181
00:12:23,101 --> 00:12:25,436
Martin, I wrote a new line.

182
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,896
What? No.

183
00:12:26,896 --> 00:12:28,898
What do you mean no? It's awesome.

184
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,778
Do you mind?

185
00:12:33,778 --> 00:12:34,779
No.

186
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:40,117
Here...

187
00:12:45,289 --> 00:12:46,499
There.

188
00:12:46,582 --> 00:12:48,042
Thanks.

189
00:12:48,918 --> 00:12:50,211
Now, I'm not prepared.

190
00:12:50,211 --> 00:12:51,837
Look, it flows better.

191
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:53,339
Honey, I love you.

192
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:54,632
I love you too.

193
00:12:54,632 --> 00:12:56,050
See it flows.
- I know.

194
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,637
But you keep changing things and
making it more difficult for me.

195
00:13:04,433 --> 00:13:06,519
My dad works at the mill.

196
00:13:16,737 --> 00:13:18,822
Could you close your eyes please?

197
00:13:19,323 --> 00:13:20,532
Ya.

198
00:13:24,245 --> 00:13:26,705
So the scene is very emotional.

199
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:28,123
Alice,

200
00:13:28,123 --> 00:13:30,000
Mrs. Hathaway doesn't
really want her husband

201
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,212
to keep investigating these murders.
- Ya, I know, we read it.

202
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:35,839
You got them, I'm just directing.

203
00:13:35,964 --> 00:13:38,550
Martin, get in position.

204
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,968
You need to re-assure her.

205
00:13:40,636 --> 00:13:42,554
Wait. Do you know what
're-assure her' means?

206
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:44,556
Ya, I think so.

207
00:13:44,598 --> 00:13:47,142
Okay, we're going to shoot
on Alice's side first.

208
00:13:47,142 --> 00:13:49,436
Okay Preston, so a few
seconds after I say 'action',

209
00:13:49,436 --> 00:13:50,729
I want you to walk to the pay-phone.

210
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:52,397
You know, make the place
look like it's busy.

211
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:55,400
Hello, hello...
- I know what that looks like.

212
00:13:58,278 --> 00:13:59,071
Asshole.

213
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:02,282
Can you stop blowing shit up for
two seconds and deal with the camera?

214
00:14:02,282 --> 00:14:04,159
Guys, sorry man.

215
00:14:04,284 --> 00:14:05,869
Okay you guys lets rehearse this.

216
00:14:05,869 --> 00:14:09,039
But remember, save the real
performance for when we're filming.

217
00:14:09,122 --> 00:14:11,792
Here we go, positions and...

218
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:13,001
action!

219
00:14:13,293 --> 00:14:15,504
So I'm going to stay
here and investigate.

220
00:14:15,504 --> 00:14:18,048
I think it'll be safer if you
left town for a couple of days.

221
00:14:18,256 --> 00:14:21,593
John, I don't like it,
this case, these murders.

222
00:14:22,219 --> 00:14:25,180
Well, what am I suppose to do?
Go to Michigan with you?

223
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:28,433
Mackinac Island is beautiful
is time of the year.

224
00:14:28,725 --> 00:14:30,769
Sweet heart, this is mine job.

225
00:14:31,728 --> 00:14:33,813
The dead coming back to life.

226
00:14:34,397 --> 00:14:35,899
I think you're in danger.

227
00:14:36,024 --> 00:14:39,694
I have no... I have no choice.

228
00:14:39,736 --> 00:14:41,905
You do have a choice.

229
00:14:42,614 --> 00:14:44,407
We all do.

230
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:49,704
John,

231
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:52,457
I've never ask you to stop.

232
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:56,795
I've never ask you to
give up or walk away.

233
00:14:57,212 --> 00:14:59,339
But I'm asking you now.

234
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:01,341
Please.

235
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,551
For me.

236
00:15:04,177 --> 00:15:05,678
Don't go.

237
00:15:06,137 --> 00:15:07,889
Don't leave me.

238
00:15:09,724 --> 00:15:13,228
I need to know this isn't the
last time I'm going to see you.

239
00:15:15,939 --> 00:15:18,274
Just love you so much.

240
00:15:24,364 --> 00:15:26,449
I love you too.

241
00:15:28,368 --> 00:15:30,536
Was that good?

242
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:38,461
Ya, ya that was... great.

243
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:49,555
Production value!

244
00:15:49,722 --> 00:15:51,682
Cary, you popped film
in the camera, right?

245
00:15:51,682 --> 00:15:53,184
I didn't put it in.
- What?

246
00:15:53,184 --> 00:15:54,101
Put it in!

247
00:15:54,101 --> 00:15:56,312
Joe, get the microphone! Go! Go! Go!

248
00:15:59,607 --> 00:16:01,233
Come on, get that tripod set up!

249
00:16:01,275 --> 00:16:03,277
Preston, in position!
- I will!

250
00:16:05,863 --> 00:16:09,116
Martin you know your lines!
Cary get the camera ready!

251
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:13,204
I hope we don't miss it.

252
00:16:16,499 --> 00:16:18,918
Shut up!
- I am trying!

253
00:16:19,335 --> 00:16:21,128
Position, position!
- Ready!

254
00:16:21,128 --> 00:16:24,131
Start filming. Be extra loud
when the train passes by.

255
00:16:24,131 --> 00:16:27,259
Here we go. And 'Action'!

256
00:16:27,301 --> 00:16:30,054
Look, I'm going to stay
here and investigate.

257
00:16:30,054 --> 00:16:33,891
I think it'll safer if you
left town for a couple of days.

258
00:16:33,932 --> 00:16:36,894
John, I don't like it.
This case, these murders.

259
00:16:36,894 --> 00:16:39,730
What do you want me to do?
Go to Michigan with you?

260
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:42,566
Mackinac Island is beautiful
this time of the year.

261
00:16:45,527 --> 00:16:47,696
The dead coming back to life.

262
00:16:47,696 --> 00:16:49,448
I think you're in danger!

263
00:16:49,448 --> 00:16:50,908
I don't have a choice!

264
00:16:50,908 --> 00:16:52,534
You do have a choice!

265
00:16:52,534 --> 00:16:54,369
We all do!

266
00:16:56,538 --> 00:16:59,958
John, I've never ask you to stop!

267
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:02,544
I've never ask you to
give up or walk away!

268
00:17:03,253 --> 00:17:05,172
But I am asking you now!

269
00:17:05,172 --> 00:17:08,634
Please, for me. Just don't go!

270
00:17:08,717 --> 00:17:12,137
Just don't go back. Don't leave me!

271
00:17:12,512 --> 00:17:16,224
I need to know this isn't the
last time I'm going to see you!

272
00:17:17,267 --> 00:17:20,145
I love you so much!
- I love you too!

273
00:17:20,145 --> 00:17:21,146
Guys watch out!

274
00:17:21,146 --> 00:17:22,731
Joe, what the hell...

275
00:17:25,776 --> 00:17:28,528
Oh my God! Run!

276
00:17:29,696 --> 00:17:31,573
Oh my God!

277
00:17:34,284 --> 00:17:35,535
Holy shit!

278
00:17:35,535 --> 00:17:37,037
Go! Go! Go!

279
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:42,792
Alice!

280
00:17:42,792 --> 00:17:45,003
Joe let’s go! We got to go!

281
00:17:48,214 --> 00:17:49,215
Keep going!

282
00:17:49,215 --> 00:17:50,634
Are we alive!

283
00:17:53,136 --> 00:17:54,220
Run!

284
00:18:12,614 --> 00:18:14,824
I don't want to die!

285
00:19:53,964 --> 00:19:55,174
Guys.

286
00:19:56,508 --> 00:19:57,885
I'm okay.

287
00:19:57,885 --> 00:19:59,928
Martin, you okay?

288
00:20:01,346 --> 00:20:03,765
Though I think I'm
having a heart attack.

289
00:20:03,765 --> 00:20:05,017
And I have a scrape.

290
00:20:05,017 --> 00:20:06,560
Joe! Oh my God.

291
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,353
Guys, did you see all the explosions?

292
00:20:08,353 --> 00:20:09,521
You guys seen Alice?

293
00:20:09,521 --> 00:20:11,231
Joe, so unbelievable!

294
00:20:13,942 --> 00:20:15,152
Why is this happening?
- Martin, it's going to be okay.

295
00:20:15,152 --> 00:20:16,653
Martin, it's going to be okay.

296
00:20:16,653 --> 00:20:18,488
No, it's not dude.

297
00:20:24,995 --> 00:20:27,330
Shit!

298
00:20:33,044 --> 00:20:35,255
What's all that blood?

299
00:20:37,966 --> 00:20:39,634
What's the blood?

300
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:41,553
Someone got hurt?

301
00:20:44,848 --> 00:20:46,641
Joe, what are you doing?
- Joe, stop!

302
00:20:51,271 --> 00:20:54,774
It's mine fake blood. It's fake.

303
00:20:58,278 --> 00:20:59,320
Guys.

304
00:20:59,738 --> 00:21:01,322
Come here, what are these things?

305
00:21:01,364 --> 00:21:03,158
No one cares.

306
00:21:03,158 --> 00:21:04,117
Look around you.

307
00:21:04,117 --> 00:21:05,869
They look like white
Rubik cubes or something.

308
00:21:05,869 --> 00:21:07,287
I don't think that's what they are.

309
00:21:07,287 --> 00:21:09,122
Maybe white metals, or something.

310
00:21:09,122 --> 00:21:10,457
There's like a billion of them.

311
00:21:10,498 --> 00:21:11,791
What's going on?

312
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:14,210
Martin, it's going to be okay, alright.
- Are you serious?

313
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:17,463
Guys, get up here. You can
see everything from up here.

314
00:21:18,298 --> 00:21:19,632
Joe.

315
00:21:34,564 --> 00:21:39,110
According to my uncle Jeff, an accident
like this is exceptionally rare.

316
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,154
It wasn't an accident.

317
00:21:41,154 --> 00:21:41,988
What?

318
00:21:41,988 --> 00:21:43,448
There was truck on the train track.

319
00:21:43,448 --> 00:21:46,409
Are you serious?
- Like driving on the tracks?

320
00:21:47,827 --> 00:21:49,370
There.

321
00:21:55,877 --> 00:21:57,378
Oh my Gosh.

322
00:21:57,879 --> 00:22:00,590
How could a pick-up truck derail a train?
That's impossible.

323
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,966
Obviously it isn't.

324
00:22:01,966 --> 00:22:03,509
Oh shit!

325
00:22:05,845 --> 00:22:09,056
Oh my God. I know that truck.

326
00:22:09,473 --> 00:22:11,017
Guys.

327
00:22:12,143 --> 00:22:16,272
Is that him?
- Yes, it's him.

328
00:22:16,272 --> 00:22:19,775
Who?
- Yes it is, for sure.

329
00:22:19,775 --> 00:22:21,402
Who is it?

330
00:22:24,572 --> 00:22:26,073
Dr Woodward.

331
00:22:26,073 --> 00:22:27,199
Dr Woodward?

332
00:22:27,825 --> 00:22:28,909
Biology.

333
00:22:28,951 --> 00:22:31,495
Honours, Biology.
- Wow!

334
00:22:31,745 --> 00:22:33,455
I am not in his class.

335
00:22:33,455 --> 00:22:35,541
We know.
- Shut up, Cary.

336
00:22:39,169 --> 00:22:42,506
Remember when old man Woodward
told your electronic football?

337
00:22:42,548 --> 00:22:45,551
Yes, he put it in the dungeon
and never gave it back.

338
00:22:45,592 --> 00:22:46,593
Dungeon?

339
00:22:46,593 --> 00:22:49,179
That trailer where Woodward
keeps in the school's parking lot.

340
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:51,223
Dr Woodward?

341
00:22:52,016 --> 00:22:53,517
Dr Woodward?

342
00:23:07,614 --> 00:23:10,450
Map of the Contiguous United States.

343
00:23:10,534 --> 00:23:12,119
What's the writing?

344
00:23:12,286 --> 00:23:13,704
Date and time.

345
00:23:13,704 --> 00:23:15,330
What's this line?

346
00:23:15,831 --> 00:23:18,250
The schedule for the train.

347
00:23:32,431 --> 00:23:34,307
Who are you?

348
00:23:34,933 --> 00:23:36,226
Dr Woodward,

349
00:23:36,226 --> 00:23:37,894
...it's me,

350
00:23:37,894 --> 00:23:39,271
Charles Kaznyk,

351
00:23:39,396 --> 00:23:40,856
...fourth period.

352
00:23:41,356 --> 00:23:43,692
You've been in an accident.
You're going to be okay.

353
00:23:43,775 --> 00:23:46,361
Oh shit!

354
00:23:48,154 --> 00:23:50,782
Swear... I will kill you.

355
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:55,453
Do not speak of this.

356
00:23:55,745 --> 00:23:58,373
Or else, you...

357
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:01,960
and your parents...

358
00:24:02,085 --> 00:24:03,795
will die.

359
00:24:06,881 --> 00:24:08,550
Guys look.

360
00:24:08,925 --> 00:24:11,052
We shouldn't be here.
- Go!

361
00:24:11,094 --> 00:24:13,596
Come on! Let's get out of here!

362
00:24:19,352 --> 00:24:21,187
Guys, come on!

363
00:24:26,484 --> 00:24:27,944
Guys, come on!

364
00:24:28,152 --> 00:24:31,114
Hurry up! Let's go! Let's go!

365
00:24:34,993 --> 00:24:36,995
Get in!

366
00:24:51,717 --> 00:24:52,927
Did you get the plate?

367
00:24:52,927 --> 00:24:54,846
I didn't get the plate. Did you get it?

368
00:25:05,231 --> 00:25:06,607
Oh God! That was insane!

369
00:25:06,607 --> 00:25:08,693
He had a gun! I've never seen a gun!

370
00:25:08,693 --> 00:25:11,153
My heart is pounding!
That train could have kill us!

371
00:25:11,153 --> 00:25:12,405
Are you okay?

372
00:25:12,405 --> 00:25:14,490
Oh shit, my camera's like shattered now!

373
00:25:14,532 --> 00:25:17,159
Guys, I've never had a
teacher aiming a gun at me!

374
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:18,577
How can I drive when everyone's yelling?

375
00:25:18,577 --> 00:25:20,162
Guys, keep it down.

376
00:25:20,871 --> 00:25:24,458
You will die, your parents will die.
Guys, that's not good information.

377
00:25:24,458 --> 00:25:26,627
Shit, the focus ring just fell off!

378
00:25:26,627 --> 00:25:28,045
No one cares about your camera!

379
00:25:28,045 --> 00:25:30,464
Guys, am I the only one shaking?

380
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:32,967
I'm crying.
- We can't tell anyone we were there.

381
00:25:32,967 --> 00:25:34,760
My dad can't find out I took his car.

382
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:36,011
You guys here me?

383
00:25:36,011 --> 00:25:39,390
It's okay. We're not
saying anything to anyone.

384
00:25:40,808 --> 00:25:44,019
Guys, we are not saying anything are we?

385
00:25:44,019 --> 00:25:46,146
No.

386
00:25:46,563 --> 00:25:47,898
See?

387
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:49,817
No one is going to know.

388
00:25:50,317 --> 00:25:52,277
We'll sink it here.

389
00:25:59,284 --> 00:26:00,619
Joe.

390
00:26:04,206 --> 00:26:05,958
Thank you.

391
00:26:07,209 --> 00:26:09,670
I never should have done this.

392
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:48,792
Joe? Joe, wake up.

393
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:51,503
Make sure you let Lucy out, alright?
- I will.

394
00:26:51,503 --> 00:26:53,797
What are you going to do?
Are you going to be at Charles' today?

395
00:26:53,838 --> 00:26:55,090
Yes, I'll be with Charles.

396
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:57,259
Alright, I'm heading in. There's
something I got to deal with.

397
00:26:57,342 --> 00:26:59,844
Don't forget to get the Oar.***
- I won't.

398
00:27:10,772 --> 00:27:12,190
Oh, come on.

399
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:13,900
No, you're not wearing that.

400
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,735
No one in the house is wearing that.

401
00:27:15,735 --> 00:27:17,612
Oh really. Compared to
Debbie, these are long.

402
00:27:17,612 --> 00:27:18,905
Listen to your mother.

403
00:27:18,905 --> 00:27:21,616
So I can't go to Wendy's party
over the shorts? Not fair!

404
00:27:21,616 --> 00:27:24,035
Jennifer, we're not in Africa.

405
00:27:25,495 --> 00:27:27,247
Do we have anymore English muffins?

406
00:27:27,247 --> 00:27:28,164
Why don't you get off and check?

407
00:27:28,164 --> 00:27:30,500
Hey, tell the twins to stop.
- I can't.

408
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,126
Good morning Joe.
- Good morning Mr. Kaznyk.

409
00:27:32,418 --> 00:27:34,754
Hi Joe, did you hear
about the train crash?

410
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:37,548
No.
- It's on the news.

411
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:39,509
<i>...use local crews, instead</i>

Do you believe this?

417
00:27:53,648 --> 00:27:54,941
No.

418
00:27:55,483 --> 00:27:58,277
It's on the news, that means it's real.
- I know.

00:28:09,413 --> 00:28:11,749
That would be a great
help, thank you so much.

427
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:22,301

428
00:28:24,136 --> 00:28:26,013
My God.

429
00:28:26,639 --> 00:28:28,724
Joe, you're so awesome.

430
00:28:29,225 --> 00:28:30,017
What?

431
00:28:30,017 --> 00:28:32,978
We can use it, we can film it.

432
00:28:33,479 --> 00:28:35,106
You want to go back?

433
00:28:35,106 --> 00:28:37,191
Oh shit, that's mint.
- Really?

434
00:28:37,233 --> 00:28:39,443
You're a total brain. We
got to get the camera fixed

435
00:28:39,443 --> 00:28:40,986
film developed from last night.
- Okay.

436
00:28:40,986 --> 00:28:43,447
I am going to steal
some money from my mum.

437
00:28:45,074 --> 00:28:47,618
If any of the footage is
useable from last night,

438
00:28:47,618 --> 00:28:49,870
that means we need Alice
to play the wife again.

439
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:51,830
Oh yes, I thought she was really good.

440
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:54,124
Yes, she was mint but
she's never going to do it.

441
00:28:54,124 --> 00:28:55,334
I think she will.

442
00:28:55,334 --> 00:28:57,127
There's no way. You heard what she said.

443
00:28:57,127 --> 00:28:58,712
But that's before the new scenes, right?

444
00:28:58,712 --> 00:29:00,964
You honestly think she
cares about the scenes?

445
00:29:00,964 --> 00:29:02,299
She was totally vague.

446
00:29:02,299 --> 00:29:03,759
Yes, she was. We all were.

447
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:07,763
Lens is cracked, focus ring broke.

448
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,723
Do you think it's fixable?

449
00:29:09,765 --> 00:29:11,517
I guess it is cheaper to get a new one.

450
00:29:11,517 --> 00:29:13,644
The camera is busted man. It's over.

451
00:29:13,644 --> 00:29:15,646
We can use my dad's
camera. It's got slow...

452
00:29:15,646 --> 00:29:16,522
<i>Hello</ i>?</i>

453
00:29:16,522 --> 00:29:19,274

00:29:19,274 --> 00:29:20,275
<i>Hi</ i>.</i>

455
00:29:20,275 --> 00:29:22,319
So we have some new
scenes for the movie,

456
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:24,655
and Charles and I are
hoping you'll be in them.

457
00:29:24,905 --> 00:29:29,076
<i>Oh,... no. I'm done with that.</ i></i>

458
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:32,788
I need this film developed as soon
as possible. Can you do it overnight?

459
00:29:32,788 --> 00:29:36,041
Asshole, no one can do it overnight.

460
00:29:36,667 --> 00:29:38,627
You want to buy some pot?

461
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,880
No, no, thank you.

462
00:29:41,922 --> 00:29:43,423
Well, what is the fastest you can do?

463
00:29:43,423 --> 00:29:44,800
I can make it a rush.

464
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,344
and get your film back in three days.

465
00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:49,721
And what is your sister up to?

466
00:29:49,805 --> 00:29:52,224
The hot one, not the other one.

467
00:29:52,224 --> 00:29:53,099
I don't know.

468
00:29:53,099 --> 00:29:54,726
<i>watching the crash on the news</i>

469
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:56,478

00:29:56,478 --> 00:29:57,229
<i>I should go.</i>

471
00:29:57,229 --> 00:29:58,939
Wait, hold on. I'll come over,

472
00:29:58,939 --> 00:30:00,565
<i>I'll bring the scenes.
- No, no!</i>

473
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:02,317
I'll be right there. It's a good idea.

474
00:30:02,525 --> 00:30:04,527
I don't care what Charles wants.

475
00:30:04,527 --> 00:30:05,737
I said 'no' on the phone.

476
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:07,864
I know you totally did.
I know that's true but...

477
00:30:07,864 --> 00:30:09,574
Now you are at my house.

478
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:11,284
I am, which...

479
00:30:11,284 --> 00:30:14,621
I don't understand why you guys
keep working on that stupid movie.

480
00:30:16,998 --> 00:30:18,375
You should go.

481
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:30,970
What's this?

482
00:30:32,388 --> 00:30:34,599
He was just inviting me to a party.

483
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:38,019
Good morning, Mr Dainard.

484
00:30:39,979 --> 00:30:41,856
She's not going to your party.

485
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,274
Yes sir.

486
00:30:51,366 --> 00:30:53,451
You, get out of here.

487
00:30:53,868 --> 00:30:57,455
You go home and you
don't come back here!

488
00:30:58,498 --> 00:31:00,541
I don't want to see you.

489
00:31:02,877 --> 00:31:04,587
Ally come inside.

490
00:31:11,219 --> 00:31:14,013
Ally, I'm in the kitchen.

491
00:31:15,973 --> 00:31:17,433
I'll do it.

492
00:31:21,103 --> 00:31:22,438
What?

493
00:31:28,444 --> 00:31:30,696
Cut! That was mint!

494
00:31:30,821 --> 00:31:33,991
Oh my God, with the train, so good.

495
00:31:34,116 --> 00:31:35,743
Joe, reload the cap gun.
- Okay.

496
00:31:35,743 --> 00:31:37,036
We'll shoot another angle next.

497
00:31:37,036 --> 00:31:38,370
Alice that was mint.

498
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:40,372
Martin go over faster next time.

499
00:31:40,372 --> 00:31:43,918
I'll try Charles. I was just
crying out last night man.

500
00:31:43,918 --> 00:31:45,795
Guys, did it really look good?

501
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,421
You look awesome.

502
00:31:49,131 --> 00:31:50,883
What do you think happened?

503
00:31:51,926 --> 00:31:54,220
You mean why he crashed the train?

504
00:31:55,221 --> 00:31:57,431
I just got a horrible feeling.

505
00:32:02,645 --> 00:32:04,938
Dude, what are you doing?

506
00:32:17,659 --> 00:32:19,912
That whole thing is an Air Force train.

507
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:21,121
What?

508
00:32:21,371 --> 00:32:23,499
I make models, like plastic ones.

509
00:32:23,499 --> 00:32:24,500
You know, go home, paint them.

510
00:32:24,541 --> 00:32:26,168
And he's not embarrassed by that.

511
00:32:26,168 --> 00:32:27,461
Whose talking, math camp.

512
00:32:27,503 --> 00:32:28,212
Thanks.

513
00:32:28,212 --> 00:32:30,255
Can I have some coffee please?
Cream on the side.

514
00:32:30,255 --> 00:32:31,506
He's so sophisticated.

515
00:32:31,506 --> 00:32:32,591
Shut up. I like coffee.

516
00:32:32,716 --> 00:32:33,884
No one likes coffee.

517
00:32:33,884 --> 00:32:36,595
Air Force trains, even the
models have these hooks.

518
00:32:36,595 --> 00:32:37,679
Oh, they do.

519
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,723
For when the trains are
loaded on the transport ships.

520
00:32:39,723 --> 00:32:40,974
Every car on that crash had...

521
00:32:41,016 --> 00:32:43,226
Joe, you stop talking about it alright?

522
00:32:43,226 --> 00:32:44,144
Wait guys.

523
00:32:44,144 --> 00:32:46,730
Am I the only guy who doesn't
understand any of this means?

524
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:48,231
Probably 'Smartin'.
- Cary shut up.

525
00:32:48,231 --> 00:32:49,691
I don't like it when you call me that.

526
00:32:49,691 --> 00:32:51,693
I'm sorry 'Smartin'.
Let’s just go cry about it.

527
00:32:51,693 --> 00:32:53,904
Dr Woodward had that map.

528
00:32:53,904 --> 00:32:56,031
He drove onto the train tracks.

529
00:32:56,031 --> 00:32:59,451
Maybe there was something
he wanted to destroy.

530
00:32:59,451 --> 00:33:00,911
You guys should shut up!

531
00:33:00,911 --> 00:33:03,413
Maybe he was sick of living
and wanted to kill himself.

532
00:33:03,413 --> 00:33:04,372
Dumb idea.

533
00:33:04,372 --> 00:33:05,749
He had a gun. Why not use that?

534
00:33:05,749 --> 00:33:08,752
There are infinitely more
effective ways to commit suicide.

535
00:33:08,752 --> 00:33:10,795
Pills, hanging,...
- Hey, Pussy!

536
00:33:10,795 --> 00:33:12,297
Stop taking the fries away!

537
00:33:12,297 --> 00:33:14,215
I order these for a reason.
- Excuse me.

538
00:33:14,215 --> 00:33:16,926
Can we have another order of fries
because my friend here is fat?

539
00:33:16,968 --> 00:33:20,138
Funny chomper, at least I don't
have to use a booster seat.

540
00:33:20,138 --> 00:33:23,016
You can jump from a building.
- Or fall down some stairs.

541
00:33:23,016 --> 00:33:24,476
Oh, that's not really effective.
- Do you think?

542
00:33:24,476 --> 00:33:27,145
If this is the Air Force, what would
the Air Force have on the train?

543
00:33:27,145 --> 00:33:29,564
Jesus, shut up about it!

544
00:33:29,564 --> 00:33:31,065
You heard what old man Woodward said.

545
00:33:31,065 --> 00:33:34,235
We can't talk about this.
Joe, seriously.

546
00:33:34,235 --> 00:33:38,281
Do you really want to take a chance that
something could happen to your dad too?

547
00:33:52,253 --> 00:33:54,672
It's loaded, move out!
- Yes, sir.

548
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:01,095
Yes, Deputy, I'm told this crash has
caused the whole massive confusion.

549
00:34:01,095 --> 00:34:03,556
Well, as you can expect, the local
authorities are trying to figure out

550
00:34:03,556 --> 00:34:05,099
just what has happened
as well as how to help.

551
00:34:05,099 --> 00:34:07,477
It's all under control.
It'll be a very fast clean up.

552
00:34:07,477 --> 00:34:09,312
Colonel, is there anything
I should know of, Sir?

553
00:34:09,312 --> 00:34:11,481
Not that I can think of, Deputy.

554
00:34:11,481 --> 00:34:13,858
I understand you've
concerns about our cargo.

555
00:34:13,858 --> 00:34:15,860
I like to see that manifest, yes.

556
00:34:15,902 --> 00:34:17,445
Well, that's not going to be possible.

557
00:34:17,445 --> 00:34:19,071
Colonel, I've a lot of people in my town

558
00:34:19,071 --> 00:34:21,199
who're going to want to
know what's taking place.

559
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,617
Which town is that?

560
00:34:22,617 --> 00:34:24,035
Lillian...

561
00:34:25,912 --> 00:34:29,457
Deputy, if you're asking me if there's
any dangerous property onboard this train,

562
00:34:29,498 --> 00:34:31,459
I can assure you that the answer is 'no'.
- Colonel!

563
00:34:31,459 --> 00:34:32,668
Colonel!

564
00:34:32,752 --> 00:34:33,919
Excuse me.

565
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:46,265
They gave me the round
around for two hours

566
00:34:46,265 --> 00:34:47,683
before they allow me to talk to anyone.

567
00:34:47,683 --> 00:34:49,518
I'll say they had
their hands full, Jack.

568
00:34:49,768 --> 00:34:52,062
Nelec, the Colonel
refused to show the manifest,

569
00:34:52,062 --> 00:34:55,024
He told me they are carrying mostly
aeroplane parts. I don't buy that.

570
00:34:55,024 --> 00:34:57,902
It's Air Force, Jack. The
aeroplane parts ought to make sense.

571
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:00,446
Sheriff, I'm telling you
there's something else going on.

572
00:35:00,446 --> 00:35:02,907
They taking moulds of tire tracks.

573
00:35:02,907 --> 00:35:04,116
Why would they be doing that?

574
00:35:04,116 --> 00:35:05,117
Who would they be looking for?

575
00:35:05,451 --> 00:35:08,579
And they are packaging these weird
little cubes into these crates.

576
00:35:08,579 --> 00:35:10,247
Weird little cubes, huh?
- They load them on these

577
00:35:10,247 --> 00:35:12,207
red trucks, there are dozens of them!

578
00:35:12,374 --> 00:35:14,376
Sheriff, I think you
need to check it out.

579
00:35:14,376 --> 00:35:16,295
And I think you need to take a break.

580
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:19,006
Jack, I've been telling
you this since Elizabeth.

581
00:35:19,006 --> 00:35:20,174
You are a good Deputy.

582
00:35:20,174 --> 00:35:21,884
But you need to take a vacation.

583
00:35:22,092 --> 00:35:23,218
Go home.

584
00:35:23,218 --> 00:35:25,304
Take off your uniform. Go fishing.

585
00:35:25,304 --> 00:35:27,097
Give your son a hug.

586
00:35:41,194 --> 00:35:44,615
Hey Breen, I'm not sure Edie's
paying you to listen to the radio!

587
00:35:47,117 --> 00:35:48,702
Breen!

588
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:50,412
Hey, Sheriff.

589
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:51,788
What's that?

590
00:35:51,788 --> 00:35:53,123
Walkman.

591
00:35:53,206 --> 00:35:54,332
It's like a stereo.

592
00:35:54,374 --> 00:35:55,834
Plays on cassette tapes.

593
00:35:55,834 --> 00:35:56,752
You want to try it?

594
00:35:56,752 --> 00:35:58,295
I don't think so.

595
00:35:58,628 --> 00:36:01,923
Kids walk around with their
own stereos, just what we need.

596
00:36:01,965 --> 00:36:04,217
It's slippery slope, my friend.

597
00:36:04,217 --> 00:36:05,927
Yes sir.

598
00:37:45,735 --> 00:37:46,986
Sheriff?

599
00:37:53,534 --> 00:37:54,743
Sheriff?

600
00:38:46,503 --> 00:38:48,463
You know what, in scene...

601
00:38:49,923 --> 00:38:51,508
Where did you learn to do this?

602
00:38:51,508 --> 00:38:53,468
Mostly the Dick Smith's
"Monsters Make-up" paint book.

603
00:38:53,468 --> 00:38:56,054
Hey Joe, we need more
footage of the train crash.

604
00:38:56,054 --> 00:38:57,139
Obviously.

605
00:38:57,139 --> 00:38:58,682
You know that train
model you've just made?

606
00:38:58,682 --> 00:38:59,766
Yap, your cargo train.

607
00:38:59,766 --> 00:39:00,892
I want to blow it up and film it.

608
00:39:00,934 --> 00:39:02,310
Let me blow it up.

609
00:39:03,812 --> 00:39:06,481
Ya, sure.
- Fantastic!

610
00:39:11,111 --> 00:39:13,697
It's fine. They can blow it up.

611
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:15,615
I don't care.

612
00:39:17,492 --> 00:39:18,785
Do you want to see it?

613
00:39:18,785 --> 00:39:20,745
The train, my train model?

614
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:22,497
The train I made.

615
00:39:23,415 --> 00:39:24,207
Wow!

616
00:39:24,207 --> 00:39:25,625
Dude, that's bitching man...

617
00:39:25,625 --> 00:39:27,335
That's like the third
time it has happened.

618
00:39:27,794 --> 00:39:30,380
So how am I suppose to be a zombie?

619
00:39:33,758 --> 00:39:38,805
Pretty much be a lifeless ghoul,
no soul, dead eyes... scary.

620
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:41,224
Did you ever have Miss Mullen?
- For English?

621
00:39:41,224 --> 00:39:42,434
Yes!

622
00:39:42,434 --> 00:39:44,978
I like her, but 'hungry
for human flesh',

623
00:39:44,978 --> 00:39:47,230
like she wants to turn
somebody into a zombie.

624
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:49,399
Cause that's how zombies do.

625
00:40:02,912 --> 00:40:04,956
My God, that's really good.

626
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:25,059
Not bad.

627
00:40:25,059 --> 00:40:25,977
Really?

628
00:40:25,977 --> 00:40:27,061
Really.

629
00:40:36,487 --> 00:40:39,031
Careful, there was a gas spill.

630
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,325
I don't even know how
much fuel I've lost.

631
00:40:41,325 --> 00:40:45,246
You don't seem to be asking very many questions!
- Give the man sometime, Mr. Blakely.

632
00:40:45,246 --> 00:40:47,456
He's only a Deputy,
he's not the Sheriff.

633
00:40:48,124 --> 00:40:51,043
I think this is most
likely a bear attack.

634
00:40:51,043 --> 00:40:53,504
Security cameras showed nothing.

635
00:40:54,046 --> 00:40:56,048
Vicky, you heard from
Sheriff Pruitt this morning?

636
00:40:56,048 --> 00:40:58,467
Negative, still no word.

637
00:41:02,596 --> 00:41:05,432
Vicky, you need to update and
send a CS unit out to Edie's,

638
00:41:05,432 --> 00:41:07,726
And you put an APB out on
the Sheriff and Breen Haskell,

639
00:41:07,726 --> 00:41:10,604
and send units over to their houses
immediately. You copy all that.

640
00:41:10,646 --> 00:41:12,606
Copy, and Jack,

641
00:41:12,606 --> 00:41:15,359
we're getting a lot of unusual calls.

642
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,152
What kind of unusual calls?

643
00:41:17,569 --> 00:41:19,446
I've never seen this
kind of things before!

644
00:41:19,446 --> 00:41:21,115
What the hell am I suppose to do?

645
00:41:21,115 --> 00:41:24,326
The insurance company guys
thought I was joking with them!

646
00:41:24,326 --> 00:41:26,328
Look at my Bonneville over here.

647
00:41:26,537 --> 00:41:28,372
They don't have the
wrench to take that out.

648
00:41:28,372 --> 00:41:30,124
Having problems with
anyone lately, Izzy?

649
00:41:31,125 --> 00:41:33,752
I was thinking you should
talk to Louis Dainard.

650
00:41:35,629 --> 00:41:37,714
I didn't help him out
with financing last year,

651
00:41:37,714 --> 00:41:41,176
and I wouldn't be surprised if this
is some sort of sick retribution.

652
00:41:41,176 --> 00:41:43,011
My generator's mishome...

653
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:46,098
My dog is gone,... disappeared.

654
00:41:46,932 --> 00:41:49,017
Maybe you should file a report.
I'll have someone come out and

655
00:41:49,017 --> 00:41:51,311
take care of each one of you, okay?

656
00:42:11,248 --> 00:42:12,666
Lucy!

657
00:42:15,752 --> 00:42:17,045
Lucy!

658
00:42:46,616 --> 00:42:47,951
I have four guys on missing cases.

659
00:42:47,992 --> 00:42:50,120
People don't feel safe
around here. And you know why?

660
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,579
Because they are not!

661
00:42:51,704 --> 00:42:53,498
The Air Force doesn't
answer a damn question.

662
00:42:53,498 --> 00:42:55,083
They've got trucks over
at Woodward's house.

663
00:42:55,083 --> 00:42:57,001
Ben heard they're looking
for Woodward's research.

664
00:42:57,001 --> 00:42:58,002
Research?

665
00:42:58,044 --> 00:42:59,420
One of the soldier on the truck,

666
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:00,797
he had like a scanner in his hand.
- Like a Geiger counter.

667
00:43:01,339 --> 00:43:03,341
They're saying it's just a
clean up at the crash site,

668
00:43:03,341 --> 00:43:04,968
but they're taking
moulds of tire tracks.

669
00:43:04,968 --> 00:43:07,595
That means they're looking for
someone. What does that means?

670
00:43:11,641 --> 00:43:13,935
Have you seen Lucy anywhere?
- No, it certainly will be 'around somewhere.

671
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:16,062
No, I'm sure she's around somewhere.

672
00:43:16,062 --> 00:43:18,022
I put a couple of slices
in the fridge for you.

673
00:43:18,064 --> 00:43:20,900
Oh! I ate those.

674
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,068
Sorry, kid.

675
00:43:22,068 --> 00:43:24,195
No problem. I'll find something.

676
00:43:27,782 --> 00:43:29,158
Pick that up, will you?

677
00:43:31,661 --> 00:43:33,496
Vicky, do you have power
down at the station?

678
00:43:33,496 --> 00:43:35,498
On and off. The whole
County is in the dark.

679
00:43:35,498 --> 00:43:38,167
Do me a favour and get water
and power up right now, will you?

680
00:43:38,167 --> 00:43:40,211
So the Air Force is looking for a car.

681
00:43:40,211 --> 00:43:41,504
Alice's dad car.

682
00:43:41,504 --> 00:43:44,340
They are taking tire prints
from the crash site, over.

683
00:43:44,382 --> 00:43:47,176
I don't want to hear about it.
That's what I've been talking about.

684
00:43:47,176 --> 00:43:48,803
They could be monitoring us right now.

685
00:43:48,803 --> 00:43:50,513
Jesus, shut up!

686
00:43:51,013 --> 00:43:51,722
Over.

687
00:43:51,722 --> 00:43:54,850
The military is at Woodward's
house looking for his research.

688
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:55,768
Whatever that means?

689
00:43:55,768 --> 00:43:57,728
Do not freak out on me and be a dick.

690
00:43:57,728 --> 00:43:59,730
Are you going to come
and help me or not?

691
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:01,899
I need you to make Alice's zombie again.

692
00:44:01,899 --> 00:44:03,818
Okay, I'll do the makeup.

693
00:44:04,276 --> 00:44:05,277
Over.

694
00:44:09,198 --> 00:44:11,784
Cables are gone. All
the posts are empty.

695
00:44:12,284 --> 00:44:14,161
Same thing over here in Rose Hill.

696
00:44:14,161 --> 00:44:16,413
Somebody took the damn wires down.

697
00:44:16,413 --> 00:44:18,374
Holy shit!

698
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:20,125
Rooney, you got anything?

699
00:44:20,542 --> 00:44:22,253
Rooney, you copy?
- You are missing for at least a mile...

700
00:44:22,253 --> 00:44:24,463
We got a half mile of copper missing.

701
00:44:24,672 --> 00:44:26,632
Lines are back up with M-38.

702
00:44:26,632 --> 00:44:29,051
Truck 14, Rooney's out of the junkyard.

703
00:44:29,051 --> 00:44:31,387
I'll give you an
update when I hear back.

704
00:44:37,017 --> 00:44:42,022
Subtitle By: Firstsub

705
00:45:43,041 --> 00:45:45,126
I want to know who took them.

706
00:45:45,126 --> 00:45:47,045
20 microwaves.

707
00:45:47,337 --> 00:45:48,129
Gone!

708
00:45:48,213 --> 00:45:49,756
From my inventory.

709
00:45:49,756 --> 00:45:51,841
Everywhere you look
things are going missing.

710
00:45:51,841 --> 00:45:54,511
We've got trains
crashing, people vanishing.

711
00:45:54,511 --> 00:45:56,679
Belmont's County is without power.

712
00:45:56,679 --> 00:45:58,473
You know what this feels like to me?

713
00:45:58,473 --> 00:46:00,975
This feels like a "Russian invasion".

714
00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:04,896
I don't think the
Russian has anything to do

715
00:46:04,896 --> 00:46:06,606
with what's going on in the town.

716
00:46:06,606 --> 00:46:08,274
But I'm calling a curfew...

717
00:46:08,274 --> 00:46:11,694
Unless you can tell me who's
been messing with our stuffs.

718
00:46:11,736 --> 00:46:14,197
I say it's the Soviets.

719
00:46:14,238 --> 00:46:17,617
And I think Jack, we
need Sheriff Pruitt back.

720
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:20,536
We've got good people working on that.

721
00:46:21,162 --> 00:46:22,789
Mr. McCandless.

722
00:46:25,917 --> 00:46:29,670
Since Wednesday morning,
my ham-radio was a mess.

723
00:46:29,712 --> 00:46:32,298
Some frequencies, which I like scan,

724
00:46:32,507 --> 00:46:34,550
I'm hearing military chatter.

725
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:37,637
But it is distorted. And
I don't know what it is.

726
00:46:37,637 --> 00:46:38,513
Have you heard that?

727
00:46:38,513 --> 00:46:40,932
Mr. McCandless, can I have a
word with you in private, please?

728
00:46:40,932 --> 00:46:43,684
It was like having my radio hijacked.

729
00:46:43,684 --> 00:46:44,810
I'm sure it was very annoying.

730
00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:46,479
You don't know those
frequencies off hand do you?

731
00:46:46,479 --> 00:46:47,647
Oh, sure I do.

732
00:46:47,647 --> 00:46:49,231
13,201,...

733
00:46:49,899 --> 00:46:51,734
Danny, why don't you
get in touch with Vicky.

734
00:46:51,734 --> 00:46:52,777
Hey Dave, have you seen Milner?

735
00:46:52,777 --> 00:46:54,028
No sir, I haven't.

736
00:46:54,028 --> 00:46:56,447
Deputy, something crawled by my
garage! It's paw is almost a foot!

737
00:46:56,447 --> 00:47:01,243
Tom! Have you seen Milner?
- Have you try his office?

738
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:03,162
...I try to his office.

739
00:47:03,371 --> 00:47:05,664
What are you doing about the
power? We've been off for two days!

740
00:47:07,083 --> 00:47:08,167
Hey Rosko!

741
00:47:09,168 --> 00:47:12,630
Rosko, I need you to get everybody you
have tuned to those frequencies, understand?

742
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:13,214
No.

743
00:47:13,255 --> 00:47:16,509
Hey Milner, don't you have a
radio scanner with a descrambler?

744
00:47:16,509 --> 00:47:17,676
Voice? I have it at home.

745
00:47:17,676 --> 00:47:19,553
Whatever. Get it. Bring it down here
and set it up. Wouldn't you please?

746
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:20,804
Jack, what is this?

747
00:47:20,804 --> 00:47:23,265
I think the Air Force
is using our channels.

748
00:47:23,265 --> 00:47:26,018
He was at my house yesterday
morning. Are you aware of that?

749
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:28,062
We brought him in for the car
lots and other stuffs, he's clean.

750
00:47:28,062 --> 00:47:32,399
I would appreciate it if you inform
your son, my house is off limits.

751
00:47:32,566 --> 00:47:34,485
And so is my daughter.

752
00:47:38,947 --> 00:47:40,991
I think the makeup was better yesterday.

753
00:47:41,492 --> 00:47:43,786
No,... it's good.

754
00:47:43,952 --> 00:47:45,788
I think it looks good.

755
00:47:46,872 --> 00:47:48,582
I should have cleaned up my room.

756
00:47:53,295 --> 00:47:55,214
You made all these models?

757
00:47:55,923 --> 00:48:00,510
Yes. Yes, that one is "The
Hunchback of Notre Dame."

758
00:48:00,886 --> 00:48:02,596
We watch that one on...

759
00:48:10,896 --> 00:48:13,482
This is the train I wanted to destroy.

760
00:48:14,691 --> 00:48:16,943
Looks real.

761
00:48:17,069 --> 00:48:18,653
It looks so old.

762
00:48:19,196 --> 00:48:21,740
Yes, it's dry brush technique.

763
00:48:23,325 --> 00:48:24,910
It runs off a coat of paint. and
then you add something like...

764
00:48:25,202 --> 00:48:27,120
and then you put something like...

765
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:30,290
- Euro grey over it.
- Euro grey?

766
00:48:30,290 --> 00:48:34,419
Oh yes, there's like 14
different greys. It gets crazy.

767
00:48:40,133 --> 00:48:41,843
What was that necklace?

768
00:48:42,135 --> 00:48:44,679
The one you were holding
at the train crash.

769
00:48:44,888 --> 00:48:46,514
Was it your moms?

770
00:48:49,434 --> 00:48:52,354
My dad gave it to her
the day I was born.

771
00:48:52,896 --> 00:48:54,939
She wears it all the time.

772
00:48:54,939 --> 00:48:56,733
Or used to.

773
00:49:00,862 --> 00:49:03,031
It was bad how she die and...

774
00:49:04,365 --> 00:49:06,493
But my dad got it back.

775
00:49:10,163 --> 00:49:12,582
Guys! What the hell?
No one knew where you were.

776
00:49:12,582 --> 00:49:13,583
We were here.

777
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:14,876
You got to play the soldier!

778
00:49:14,876 --> 00:49:16,461
I thought you were calling Evan.

779
00:49:16,461 --> 00:49:18,755
Evan blew us off. He is a pussy.

780
00:49:19,881 --> 00:49:21,299
Excuse me.

781
00:49:21,299 --> 00:49:22,091
It's okay.

782
00:49:22,091 --> 00:49:24,093
You got to do it. You're the only one.

783
00:49:24,177 --> 00:49:26,304
What do you mean they
found my dog in Brookville?

784
00:49:26,304 --> 00:49:27,889
That's another county over.

785
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:29,140
Lucy, that's where she is.

786
00:49:29,265 --> 00:49:31,142
We have more than 30 calls from people

787
00:49:31,142 --> 00:49:32,685
who found local dogs, but the thing is

788
00:49:32,685 --> 00:49:34,687
the calls coming in weren't local.

789
00:49:36,856 --> 00:49:38,316
Like they all just...

790
00:49:38,608 --> 00:49:40,818
ran away in every direction.

791
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:43,362
This isn't like her.
She doesn't disappear.

792
00:49:43,362 --> 00:49:45,907
Okay, calm down. Just
tell what she looks like.

793
00:49:45,948 --> 00:49:48,576
She's got dark hair and rollers.
You know what rollers are?

794
00:49:48,576 --> 00:49:49,994
Yes, I know what rollers are.

795
00:49:50,411 --> 00:49:51,579
Hang on.

796
00:49:55,708 --> 00:49:57,084
It's definitely Air Force.

797
00:49:57,084 --> 00:49:58,628
It's Air Force. But what does it mean?

798
00:49:58,628 --> 00:50:00,671
Why are they transmitting
on these frequencies?

799
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,131
Maybe it's not even Air Force.

800
00:50:02,131 --> 00:50:04,550
I bet you five bucks it's Air Force.
- Five Bucks?

801
00:50:04,550 --> 00:50:05,092
Sshhh!

802
00:50:05,092 --> 00:50:08,387
<i>We're going to need you to prepare
for Operation "Walking Distance".</i>

803
00:50:08,471 --> 00:50:10,014
What did he say? Operation, what?

804
00:50:10,014 --> 00:50:11,640
"Walking Distance".

805
00:50:12,558 --> 00:50:15,519
What's this?
- He worked at Romero Chemical.

806
00:50:15,603 --> 00:50:17,646
Found out some things
the company was doing.

807
00:50:17,646 --> 00:50:19,648
And after what you told
me last night at the bar.

808
00:50:19,648 --> 00:50:21,066
I thought you should know.

809
00:50:22,026 --> 00:50:24,820
Are we going to be in
trouble for being here?

810
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:25,487
Production value.

811
00:50:25,487 --> 00:50:28,532
Stop talking about production
value. Air Force is going to kill us!

812
00:50:28,949 --> 00:50:30,242
Don't cover my mouth!

813
00:50:30,284 --> 00:50:32,119
We just make this discovery today.

814
00:50:32,119 --> 00:50:34,330
You understand this is Top Secret.
- Of course.

815
00:50:34,330 --> 00:50:38,125
I would never have given this information,
unless we had worked together in Vietnam.

816
00:50:38,125 --> 00:50:40,753
Those were hard times...
- We better not talk about it.

817
00:50:41,045 --> 00:50:42,963
I understand... I understand.

818
00:50:42,963 --> 00:50:44,698
You're a good friend.
You too.

819
00:50:45,344 --> 00:50:47,865
Nothing so far.
How much more is there?

820
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:51,533
About 6 more boxes in a basement.
A lot more tax returns.

821
00:50:52,054 --> 00:50:56,301
It's here somewhere, we'll find it.
If not, Woodward will tell us where he is.

822
00:50:56,587 --> 00:50:57,941
What the hell is that?

823
00:51:03,676 --> 00:51:06,449
Joe.
- Hey Mr. Lamb.

824
00:51:08,621 --> 00:51:09,963
Get in the car.

825
00:51:15,377 --> 00:51:19,241
Ahm, Mr. Lamb that's your camera but
technically that's my film.

826
00:51:26,257 --> 00:51:27,642
What the hell.

827
00:51:28,006 --> 00:51:28,666
Is it me?

828
00:51:29,358 --> 00:51:33,164
I would like to help you out deputy, I really would
but we operate on a need to know basis.

829
00:51:33,165 --> 00:51:36,313
Why are your trucks sweeping the town?
We will be out of here by shortly.

830
00:51:36,313 --> 00:51:39,481
Then I'm sure you won't mind me contacting D.C.,

831
00:51:39,481 --> 00:51:41,859
talk to some friends
about "walking distance".

832
00:51:44,823 --> 00:51:46,199
I will do it that way.

833
00:51:47,364 --> 00:51:48,574
Deputy.

834
00:51:48,907 --> 00:51:50,075
Let's talk.

835
00:51:50,075 --> 00:51:51,577
Just not here.

836
00:52:01,545 --> 00:52:04,381
This is new for the both of us.

837
00:52:05,048 --> 00:52:06,675
Dealing with anything.

838
00:52:06,675 --> 00:52:07,676
Just us.

839
00:52:07,676 --> 00:52:11,138
So I'm going to make this
as simple and clear as I can.

840
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:13,390
You are not friends with Alice Dainard.

841
00:52:13,390 --> 00:52:16,059
When I say 'no', I don't mean maybe.

842
00:52:16,059 --> 00:52:17,894
I don't mean 'yes'.

843
00:52:18,019 --> 00:52:19,521
I mean 'no'.

844
00:52:19,729 --> 00:52:22,065
I've known Louis Dainard
for a lot of years.

845
00:52:22,065 --> 00:52:24,067
He's been nothing but trouble.

846
00:52:24,067 --> 00:52:26,403
Your mother used to say
he's not such a bad guy.

847
00:52:26,403 --> 00:52:28,780
He just need a chance, that he was sad.

848
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:30,740
Well, I tried to be good to him.

849
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:32,701
Well I can't. Not anymore.

850
00:52:33,368 --> 00:52:36,288
I will not allow him or
his daughter in this house.

851
00:52:36,288 --> 00:52:39,249
I will not allow you to spend
time with her doing projects

852
00:52:39,249 --> 00:52:41,501
or whatever it is
that you do, that's it!

853
00:52:41,584 --> 00:52:44,003
I hope we are clear on that.

854
00:52:45,547 --> 00:52:47,132
We're not 'clear'.

855
00:52:48,425 --> 00:52:49,426
What did you say?
- We are not in place...

856
00:52:49,426 --> 00:52:50,427
We're not clear!

857
00:52:50,427 --> 00:52:52,220
You and I are not clear about anything!

858
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:53,930
We couldn't be less clear!
- Joseph...

859
00:52:53,930 --> 00:52:56,850
Just because mum die doesn't mean
that you know anything about me.

860
00:52:56,850 --> 00:52:58,142
You don't!

861
00:52:58,142 --> 00:53:00,353
You don't know anything
about Alice either.

862
00:53:00,353 --> 00:53:02,230
She's kind...
- We are not going to have this discussion...

863
00:53:02,230 --> 00:53:05,149
She's nice to me!
- I don't care what she is!

864
00:53:06,192 --> 00:53:09,445
Her father is an irresponsible
selfish son of a bitch!

865
00:53:10,154 --> 00:53:11,072
You listen to me.

866
00:53:11,072 --> 00:53:13,908
I've got 12 thousand people in this
town who are scared out of their mind.

867
00:53:13,908 --> 00:53:16,077
And they got one person to rely on.

868
00:53:16,077 --> 00:53:18,996
It used to be someone
else but now it's just me.

869
00:54:57,552 --> 00:54:58,679
Here we go.
- Lights on.

870
00:55:02,182 --> 00:55:05,143
Deputy, drop your weapons.
Put your hands on the car.

871
00:55:05,143 --> 00:55:06,603
I'm here to see the Colonel Nelec.

872
00:55:06,728 --> 00:55:08,438
He told me to meet him here.

873
00:55:08,438 --> 00:55:11,191
You're on military
arrest, drop your weapons!

874
00:55:11,191 --> 00:55:12,859
Where Nelec?

875
00:55:15,028 --> 00:55:17,447
I don't want any more trouble, do you?

876
00:55:21,368 --> 00:55:23,286
We've been going
through your belongings.

877
00:55:23,578 --> 00:55:24,788
Looking for evidence.

878
00:55:24,830 --> 00:55:27,666
What he knew? How you knew it?

879
00:55:27,666 --> 00:55:29,793
Who else might know?

880
00:55:37,842 --> 00:55:39,803
I remember you on the lab.

881
00:55:39,928 --> 00:55:41,930
And I recall we didn't
always see eye-to-eye,

882
00:55:41,930 --> 00:55:45,183
but that is no excuse for
doing what you did here.

883
00:55:45,183 --> 00:55:47,727
So in the spirit of moving forward,

884
00:55:47,727 --> 00:55:49,562
and avoiding more trouble.

885
00:55:49,562 --> 00:55:52,232
Why don't you just tell me
where you put your research

886
00:55:52,315 --> 00:55:53,858
and who else knows about it?

887
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:56,945
I know you had someone
document the crash that night.

888
00:55:57,362 --> 00:55:59,823
Tell me who that was and I'll help you.

889
00:55:59,906 --> 00:56:01,658
I swear to God on my mother's life,

890
00:56:01,658 --> 00:56:04,869
if you help us now, we
will take care of you.

891
00:56:06,621 --> 00:56:10,375
I've seen what happens, Mr. Nelec.

892
00:56:11,251 --> 00:56:15,880
When you take care of people.
- It is mine. He is mine!

893
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:18,508
I'm going to beat him and catch him.

894
00:56:18,716 --> 00:56:22,512
He is in me, you know.

895
00:56:24,055 --> 00:56:26,391
As I am in him.

896
00:56:26,808 --> 00:56:28,351
So...

897
00:56:29,685 --> 00:56:31,854
when you see him next,

898
00:56:32,063 --> 00:56:34,732
as I'm sure you will,

899
00:56:34,857 --> 00:56:37,735
I'll be watching you too.

900
00:57:21,362 --> 00:57:24,323
Are you... were you sleeping?

901
00:57:24,323 --> 00:57:27,743
Before... earlier... no.

902
00:57:28,827 --> 00:57:30,162
Are you okay?

903
00:57:30,162 --> 00:57:32,414
Yes, I'm fine.

904
00:57:33,999 --> 00:57:36,418
You want to come in?
- Yes.

905
00:57:43,842 --> 00:57:45,636
Power still out.

906
00:57:47,096 --> 00:57:48,639
The room is still messy.

907
00:57:48,639 --> 00:57:50,682
I couldn't sleep.

908
00:57:50,682 --> 00:57:52,518
I was thinking...

909
00:57:54,061 --> 00:57:56,647
I want to tell you
something before tomorrow.

910
00:57:58,357 --> 00:58:00,859
Don't let Charles blow up your train.

911
00:58:02,653 --> 00:58:04,738
I don't think it is right.

912
00:58:05,364 --> 00:58:07,199
I know he is your friend.

913
00:58:07,574 --> 00:58:08,575
He's so bossy.

914
00:58:08,575 --> 00:58:10,619
I have known him since kindergarten.

915
00:58:10,619 --> 00:58:11,453
He's really nice.

916
00:58:11,453 --> 00:58:13,705
You should know he gets what he wants.

917
00:58:14,665 --> 00:58:17,667
I mean, who always get what they want?

918
00:58:20,295 --> 00:58:22,422
I know I don't know you at all.

919
00:58:23,048 --> 00:58:26,343
Even though, I try to feel like I do.

920
00:58:30,806 --> 00:58:34,476
Do you not... feel like that?

921
00:58:34,476 --> 00:58:36,645
No, I totally do.

922
00:58:36,645 --> 00:58:38,021
I'm just kind of...

923
00:58:38,021 --> 00:58:40,565
in shock at this entire conversation.

924
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:45,403
Power is back.

925
00:58:45,403 --> 00:58:47,405
No, no, keep it.

926
00:59:31,366 --> 00:59:33,618
It's... it's so weird.

927
00:59:34,452 --> 00:59:36,704
Watching her like this.

928
00:59:36,871 --> 00:59:38,873
as if she's still here.

929
00:59:42,710 --> 00:59:44,879
She used to look at me

930
00:59:44,879 --> 00:59:46,464
this way.

931
00:59:47,089 --> 00:59:49,091
Like really look.

932
00:59:52,845 --> 00:59:55,014
And I just knew I was there.

933
00:59:55,181 --> 00:59:57,141
Like I existed.

934
01:00:10,529 --> 01:00:12,823
He drank that morning.

935
01:00:13,532 --> 01:00:15,409
...my dad.

936
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:20,539
He missed his shift.

937
01:00:30,049 --> 01:00:32,509
Your mother took it for him.

938
01:00:32,801 --> 01:00:34,887
the day of the accident.

939
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:00,537
He...

940
01:01:01,163 --> 01:01:03,332
he wishes...

941
01:01:03,665 --> 01:01:06,585
I know he wishes it
was him instead of her.

942
01:01:11,965 --> 01:01:14,551
Sometimes I do too.

943
01:01:17,846 --> 01:01:20,057
Don't say that.

944
01:01:22,059 --> 01:01:24,269
He's your father.

945
01:01:46,166 --> 01:01:48,877
Is this normal?

946
01:01:49,711 --> 01:01:52,464
No, this is new.

947
01:02:43,014 --> 01:02:45,600
Want to tell me where you were?

948
01:02:47,727 --> 01:02:50,021
Or should I tell you?

949
01:02:58,279 --> 01:02:59,822
Sit down.

950
01:03:00,656 --> 01:03:02,450
I should go to bed.

951
01:03:02,450 --> 01:03:03,951
I want to talk with
you, I said sit down.

952
01:03:03,951 --> 01:03:05,745
I don't want to sit down.

953
01:03:07,455 --> 01:03:09,040
Bingo!

954
01:03:09,332 --> 01:03:12,460
Be just like your mother and leave.

955
01:03:13,711 --> 01:03:15,046
Dad.

956
01:03:15,296 --> 01:03:17,590
Ahead, go!

957
01:03:18,424 --> 01:03:19,967
Go!

958
01:03:27,558 --> 01:03:29,143
Alice!

959
01:03:31,478 --> 01:03:33,189
Wait!

960
01:03:56,545 --> 01:03:58,630
Ally, I'm sorry!

961
01:04:28,243 --> 01:04:30,120
Alice!

962
01:04:37,461 --> 01:04:38,879
Alice!

963
01:04:38,879 --> 01:04:40,672
Ally!

964
01:04:49,222 --> 01:04:50,223
Ally!

965
01:04:54,227 --> 01:04:57,188
<i>Fire alight at 0500 hours.</ i></i>

966
01:04:57,230 --> 01:05:00,025
<i>Operation "Walking Distance" is in effect.</ i></i>

967
01:05:00,025 --> 01:05:05,488
<i>T - minus 4 hours to evacuation.</ i></i>

968
01:05:06,156 --> 01:05:07,615
Why are you not reacting?

969
01:05:07,615 --> 01:05:08,742
That thing went through my wall!

970
01:05:08,742 --> 01:05:10,618
I told you not to pick
it up in the first place.

971
01:05:10,618 --> 01:05:11,870
What are you so angry about?

972
01:05:11,911 --> 01:05:13,246
That I'm not going to
let you blow up my train?

973
01:05:13,246 --> 01:05:14,414
That's part of it!

974
01:05:14,414 --> 01:05:15,832
Just a part!

975
01:05:16,166 --> 01:05:20,253
Hey, to tell your sister that Donnie
from Allson's broke up with Karen.

976
01:05:20,295 --> 01:05:22,463
That should end about a week ago.

977
01:05:25,216 --> 01:05:26,217
What's your problem?

978
01:05:26,217 --> 01:05:28,720
My whole movie is a
disaster because of you.

979
01:05:28,761 --> 01:05:30,305
I know my dad is a turkey.

980
01:05:30,305 --> 01:05:31,889
Whatever!

981
01:05:32,432 --> 01:05:35,643
We're still going to finish your movie!
- It is not about the movie!

982
01:05:35,643 --> 01:05:37,520
What are you talking
about? Of course it is!

983
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:38,813
Just forget it!

984
01:05:38,813 --> 01:05:41,107
Why?
- There's nothing wrong!

985
01:05:56,414 --> 01:05:59,000
I can get the camera back.
I know where my dad put it.

986
01:05:59,083 --> 01:06:00,751
We can still make it to the festival.

987
01:06:00,751 --> 01:06:02,128
It's not about the movie.

988
01:06:02,128 --> 01:06:03,254
Then what is it about?

989
01:06:03,254 --> 01:06:04,338
You don't get it, do you?

990
01:06:04,338 --> 01:06:05,131
It's obvious!

991
01:06:05,131 --> 01:06:06,966
What's obvious?
- God, you're a dumb ass!

992
01:06:06,966 --> 01:06:09,051
The night of the crash, you
started getting all weird.

993
01:06:09,051 --> 01:06:11,887
What are you talking about?
- Like Mr. Attitude all of a sudden.

994
01:06:11,887 --> 01:06:13,889
Your movie was over.
That's what you said.

995
01:06:13,889 --> 01:06:15,182
You were upset!
- Oh my God.

996
01:06:15,182 --> 01:06:16,434
I gave you my camera. I helped you!

997
01:06:16,434 --> 01:06:18,144
Don't pretend like you did this for me!

998
01:06:18,144 --> 01:06:20,229
You didn't do this for
me, and you know it!

999
01:06:20,479 --> 01:06:23,482
This was never about me.
This was always about Alice!

1000
01:06:34,368 --> 01:06:36,412
Well, you were the one who
wanted the wife in the movie.

1001
01:06:36,412 --> 01:06:37,746
Not so you could fall in love with her.

1002
01:06:37,830 --> 01:06:39,832
What do you care what I
think about Alice any way?

1003
01:06:39,832 --> 01:06:41,417
'Cause I like her!

1004
01:06:41,625 --> 01:06:43,711
That's why I asked her to do
this thing in the first place.

1005
01:06:43,711 --> 01:06:46,714
So that I could get
to know her, not you!

1006
01:06:47,756 --> 01:06:49,300
You like Alice Dainard?

1007
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:51,176
You are such an idiot!

1008
01:06:56,432 --> 01:06:57,599
Shit!

1009
01:06:57,599 --> 01:06:59,101
All that smoke.

1010
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:01,311
We can't use this.

1011
01:07:02,104 --> 01:07:04,356
You won't even let
me blow up your train.

1012
01:07:06,191 --> 01:07:08,026
This thing is bogus.

1013
01:07:11,905 --> 01:07:14,032
We could make another train blow up.

1014
01:07:20,205 --> 01:07:21,832
I do like her.

1015
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:24,167
Sorry about that.
- Shut up!

1016
01:07:25,627 --> 01:07:27,129
It's okay.

1017
01:07:27,713 --> 01:07:30,340
It doesn't even bother me.

1018
01:07:32,467 --> 01:07:34,428
She likes you too.

1019
01:07:35,679 --> 01:07:37,764
That's what really bothers me.

1020
01:07:37,931 --> 01:07:41,143
I know it sounds stupid.
Why would she ever like me?

1021
01:07:42,227 --> 01:07:45,772
I haven't lean out yet.
Doctor says it's going to happen.

1022
01:07:47,190 --> 01:07:50,443
I don't know, everything
is just so bogus.

1023
01:07:50,443 --> 01:07:51,945
Charles...

1024
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:02,455
Joe, what the hell?

1025
01:08:03,623 --> 01:08:05,333
What is that?

1026
01:08:24,853 --> 01:08:26,521
Mr. Harkin, what's going on?

1027
01:08:26,521 --> 01:08:28,731
Evacuation! The fire!

1028
01:08:39,659 --> 01:08:44,122
<i>"...being evacuated due to a wild fire
that is raging out of control,</ i></i>

1029
01:08:44,163 --> 01:08:47,959
<i>and threatening to reach the
Lillian Chemical plant."</ i></i>

1030
01:08:49,293 --> 01:08:52,004
Please take your essential items only.

1031
01:08:52,004 --> 01:08:57,093
If you drive your vehicle, follow
the caravan to the evacuation center.

1032
01:08:57,260 --> 01:08:59,595
Please remain calm.

1033
01:09:36,799 --> 01:09:39,301
Sir, the town is sealed off.

1034
01:09:39,301 --> 01:09:41,011
No one is allowed in.

1035
01:09:42,555 --> 01:09:44,390
Charles!

1036
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:45,599
Excuse me.

1037
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:48,394
Charles, thank God

1038
01:09:48,394 --> 01:09:50,020
I went back to the
house but you were gone.

1039
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:51,689
Yes, they put us on the bus.

1040
01:09:51,689 --> 01:09:52,690
Hey, sweety.

1041
01:09:52,690 --> 01:09:54,358
I'm going to find my dad.

1042
01:09:54,358 --> 01:09:56,068
You're going to tell him about that too.

1043
01:09:56,485 --> 01:09:58,612
Come back if you can't find him!

1044
01:10:09,456 --> 01:10:11,333
Mr. Dainard? It's Joe Lamb.

1045
01:10:11,375 --> 01:10:13,585
I know you don't like me.
I'm sorry about that, but...

1046
01:10:13,585 --> 01:10:15,712
I am looking for my dad.

1047
01:10:15,712 --> 01:10:17,130
They took her!

1048
01:10:17,422 --> 01:10:20,175
They took Alice!
- What?

1049
01:10:20,175 --> 01:10:21,009
I saw it.

1050
01:10:21,009 --> 01:10:23,887
It was big and...

1051
01:10:24,054 --> 01:10:26,098
I don't know what... it was something...

1052
01:10:26,223 --> 01:10:28,642
I've never... I've never seen...

1053
01:10:28,684 --> 01:10:31,478
No one believed me. They
just gave me pills...

1054
01:10:32,479 --> 01:10:34,481
No one believes me.

1055
01:10:35,232 --> 01:10:37,484
I believe you.

1056
01:10:41,488 --> 01:10:44,157
That thing took her?
- We have to go back in town!

1057
01:10:44,157 --> 01:10:45,700
To find Alice. To
find her. Come on Guys!

1058
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:47,702
Dudes, she's dead! Alice is dead!
- Don't even say that!

1059
01:10:47,702 --> 01:10:49,579
First of all, I want to live, okay?

1060
01:10:49,579 --> 01:10:51,581
Joe, what do you actually
expect us to do, man?

1061
01:10:51,581 --> 01:10:54,000
Town is closed. We're
not allowed to go back!

1062
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:54,960
Look I have an idea.

1063
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:57,170
I'm going whether or not you're
coming, which I really hope you do.

1064
01:10:57,170 --> 01:10:59,464
Come on guys!
- I've 6 explosives...

1065
01:10:59,464 --> 01:11:01,508
we can fire and blow it to shit!

1066
01:11:01,550 --> 01:11:03,009
As if I'm going to help you?

1067
01:11:03,009 --> 01:11:04,094
Do this for me...

1068
01:11:04,094 --> 01:11:07,764
I'll baby-sit the twins every
single Wendy's stupid party.

1069
01:11:07,847 --> 01:11:10,475
I'm not shitting you.
You can't ask me any questions,

1070
01:11:10,475 --> 01:11:11,893
and you can't tell anyone.

1071
01:11:11,893 --> 01:11:13,895
I'm serious. Nobody!

1072
01:11:13,937 --> 01:11:16,231
Does it have to be him?
- Yes or no, you ugly freak.

1073
01:11:16,231 --> 01:11:18,024
I'm about to rescind the offer.

1074
01:11:20,026 --> 01:11:22,779
This whole evacuation is
really freaking me out.

1075
01:11:23,113 --> 01:11:25,657
Making me re-grade my priorities.

1076
01:11:27,242 --> 01:11:30,036
I saw you over here and I
thought we could kick back.

1077
01:11:31,162 --> 01:11:32,956
We totally could.

1078
01:11:33,164 --> 01:11:34,499
Asked Charles about you,

1079
01:11:34,582 --> 01:11:36,543
he said you're a great guy.

1080
01:11:36,584 --> 01:11:38,336
I totally am.

1081
01:11:39,462 --> 01:11:42,548
Will you hate me if I start our
relationship by asking a favour?

1082
01:11:43,591 --> 01:11:45,593
There're rules to being in my car, okay?

1083
01:11:45,593 --> 01:11:47,053
Where the hell are we going anyway?

1084
01:11:47,095 --> 01:11:51,182
We're going to the school and open the
caravan Woodward has in the parking lot.

1085
01:11:52,392 --> 01:11:55,812
I bet that's where he's keeping his research.
- What research?

1086
01:11:55,853 --> 01:11:57,563
We're going to learn everything
we can about that thing,

1087
01:11:57,563 --> 01:12:00,274
so that we can find it. That's
how we're going to save Alice.

1088
01:12:01,109 --> 01:12:03,319
Dorks! No shoes on my upholstery!

1089
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:06,030
And no one touches my CB. You got it?

1090
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:08,282
What if there're padlocks on the door?

1091
01:12:08,282 --> 01:12:10,076
We're going to the school.

1092
01:12:10,409 --> 01:12:13,412
Since when this one becomes the boss?
- I don't know.

1093
01:12:14,914 --> 01:12:16,791
I got to take a leak!

1094
01:12:17,124 --> 01:12:19,502
What am I suppose to do? Piss in here?

1095
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:28,219
Thanks for the hospitality.

1096
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:35,142
Am I going alone or you're
going to end up coming with...

1097
01:13:34,701 --> 01:13:37,079
If the aircraft has already
searched Woodward's house,

1098
01:13:37,162 --> 01:13:39,373
wouldn't they search
the whole school too?

1099
01:13:40,415 --> 01:13:42,584
Maybe his room but not the dungeon.

1100
01:13:42,584 --> 01:13:45,462
Woodward’s has...
- Shut up!

1101
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:49,257
What kind of music does
she like, your sister?

1102
01:13:49,299 --> 01:13:51,968
I don't care, disco I guess.

1103
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:54,304
I can get back to disco.

1104
01:13:54,304 --> 01:13:56,765
We shouldn't take River Road.
They put a roadblock up.

1105
01:13:56,765 --> 01:14:00,185
Dork, I saw it. Observe.

1106
01:14:11,363 --> 01:14:13,239
So what, I wait here like a douche?

1107
01:14:13,239 --> 01:14:14,991
Yes, thank you so much for doing this.

1108
01:14:14,991 --> 01:14:16,618
Do you have a tire iron?

1109
01:14:27,253 --> 01:14:29,547
Joe!
- Let me try!

1110
01:14:30,173 --> 01:14:32,383
God, I hope my electronic
football is in there!

1111
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:36,721
Joe, it's impossible. There
is no way we can do this!

1112
01:14:36,721 --> 01:14:39,140
These things are made by a
bank vaulter, like a safe.

1113
01:14:39,140 --> 01:14:41,476
Professional robbers can't even
get in through these things!

1114
01:14:41,476 --> 01:14:43,603
They are so strong...

1115
01:14:44,896 --> 01:14:46,898
I loosen it for you.

1116
01:14:49,359 --> 01:14:51,402
Guys.
- All these junks?

1117
01:14:51,402 --> 01:14:52,654
He's got movies in here.

1118
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:54,989
I can't believe we're
breaking into the school.

1119
01:14:54,989 --> 01:14:56,199
Who does that?

1120
01:14:56,407 --> 01:14:58,993
Nobody does that! Elites do that!

1121
01:15:01,871 --> 01:15:04,165
Dr. Woodward was
dishonorably discharged,

1122
01:15:04,165 --> 01:15:07,960
from Nellis Air Force base in 1963.

1123
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:10,880
because of subversive
conduct. Whatever that is...

1124
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:13,424
Charles, check it out.
It's old man Woodward.

1125
01:15:14,926 --> 01:15:17,929
Back when he's like
middle aged man Woodward.

1126
01:15:18,638 --> 01:15:21,265
They've been tracking
this thing seen 1958.

1127
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:24,977
What is this?

1128
01:15:25,227 --> 01:15:29,273
It says "April 8, 1963 incident."

1129
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:30,775
I don't know.

1130
01:15:35,237 --> 01:15:36,697
Cary!
- What?

1131
01:15:36,697 --> 01:15:38,407
We have to find this thing! Come on!

1132
01:15:38,407 --> 01:15:39,742
Ok, sorry!

1133
01:15:42,328 --> 01:15:46,916
<i>Told them that this creature is much
more sophisticated than any of us.</ i></i>

1134
01:15:48,250 --> 01:15:52,838
<i>That his species is
predominantly "subterranean".</ i></i>

1135
01:15:52,838 --> 01:15:54,256
<i>Subterranean? And to
have it treated without...</i>

1136
01:15:54,256 --> 01:15:57,551
<i>compassion or respect.</ i></i>

1137
01:15:58,177 --> 01:16:01,931
<i>I explained that all he wants
is to rebuild his ship.</ i></i>

1138
01:16:01,972 --> 01:16:06,769
<i>A craft made up of those cubes of
complex shape-shifting alloys.</ i></i>

1139
01:16:06,769 --> 01:16:11,565
<i>Remarkable material that we will
never fully understand.</ i></i>

1140
01:16:12,149 --> 01:16:18,030
<i>He has been desperate to reconstitute
his ship since it crashed here in '58.</i>

1141
01:16:18,363 --> 01:16:22,618
<i>But instead of giving him the help he
needs, we held him as a prisoner.</ i></i>

1142
01:16:22,868 --> 01:16:24,703
<i>Guys it's Dr. Woodward.
He has been restrained</i>

1143
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:29,416
<i>And experimented upon, biopsied
and tortured by Nelec.</ i></i>

1144
01:16:29,583 --> 01:16:34,338
<i>Through pain and lack of compassion we
have taught him to hate us all.</ i></i>

1145
01:16:34,379 --> 01:16:36,924
<i>We have turned him into an enemy.</ i></i>

1146
01:16:36,965 --> 01:16:40,761
<i>I told them I knew these things
because he made contact with me.</ i></i>

1147
01:16:40,802 --> 01:16:44,348
<i>That he made a psychic
connection by touch.</ i></i>

1148
01:16:44,431 --> 01:16:46,516
Oh, my God!
- Jesus.

1149
01:16:46,516 --> 01:16:48,185
What's that thing?
- What the hell...

1150
01:16:48,226 --> 01:16:49,728
I can't watch this!

1151
01:16:50,312 --> 01:16:53,940
<i>The moment he made contact
I understood him.</ i></i>

1152
01:16:53,982 --> 01:16:55,901
<i>And he, me.</ i></i>

1153
01:16:56,151 --> 01:17:01,740
<i>What I know is that if we don't
change this and begin helping him,</ i></i>

1154
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:04,951
<i>we will all pay the price.</ i></i>

1155
01:17:05,827 --> 01:17:07,746
<i>But Nelec wouldn't listen.</ i></i>

1156
01:17:07,746 --> 01:17:09,414
He wasn't trying to kill it.

1157
01:17:09,414 --> 01:17:11,791
<i>He had me discharged.</i>

1158
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,168
He was trying to help him escape.

1159
01:17:13,168 --> 01:17:15,003
<i>But I won't give up.</ i></i>

1160
01:17:15,211 --> 01:17:17,797
<i>I'll do everything within my power...</i>

1161
01:17:17,797 --> 01:17:19,799
- Oh, my God!
- Guys, hear that?

1162
01:17:19,799 --> 01:17:21,635
<i>...help him rebuild that ship...</ i></i>

1163
01:17:42,864 --> 01:17:45,200
We've positive ID here.
Just a bunch of kids.

1164
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:46,701
Oh, shit.

1165
01:17:48,995 --> 01:17:52,081
Search them. Let me see that.

1166
01:17:54,876 --> 01:17:57,503
I bought those and made it myself.

1167
01:17:58,046 --> 01:18:00,590
Jesus, Cary, shut up!

1168
01:18:02,216 --> 01:18:04,260
You're the Deputy's boy.

1169
01:18:07,513 --> 01:18:08,681
No.

1170
01:18:10,099 --> 01:18:11,976
Move out!

1171
01:18:24,447 --> 01:18:28,659
Shit, oh shit!

1172
01:18:30,995 --> 01:18:34,165
Breaker, breaker,
requesting police backup.

1173
01:18:35,291 --> 01:18:38,377
Breaker 1-9, is this
the police channel?

1174
01:18:43,090 --> 01:18:45,468
Staff Sergeant.
- Hi, how are you doing?

1175
01:18:48,179 --> 01:18:49,680
Hey, Mr. Lamb.

1176
01:18:50,306 --> 01:18:51,724
Rosko.

1177
01:18:52,850 --> 01:18:55,394
Where the hell have you been?
What are you wearing?

1178
01:18:55,394 --> 01:18:56,395
Come here!

1179
01:18:56,854 --> 01:18:59,982
The Air Force set that fire. They
want the town empty for some reason.

1180
01:18:59,982 --> 01:19:03,277
The whole operation, the military operation,
evacuation, everything, it's all bad.

1181
01:19:03,277 --> 01:19:05,988
We need to find out...
- Did you hear about Joe?

1182
01:19:06,447 --> 01:19:09,658
Look, dispatch just got
a call from Citizen Band.

1183
01:19:09,658 --> 01:19:11,035
Joe and some of his friends.

1184
01:19:11,035 --> 01:19:14,371
They were grabbed by military
personnel at Middle School.

1185
01:19:17,207 --> 01:19:22,421
Preston, you tell me everything
and I won't throw you in jail.

1186
01:19:22,421 --> 01:19:23,964
Yes sir.

1187
01:19:24,089 --> 01:19:27,009
But I think you should
look at this first.

1188
01:19:30,429 --> 01:19:33,307
Mr. Sergeant, dust off 03,
is 20 minutes out.

1189
01:19:50,365 --> 01:19:52,492
What's going to happen to us?

1190
01:19:53,785 --> 01:19:55,495
I think we're going to die.

1191
01:19:55,579 --> 01:19:58,749
Shut up! They won't do that.

1192
01:19:58,749 --> 01:20:01,585
I'm not kidding, I think
they're going to kill us.

1193
01:20:02,210 --> 01:20:05,255
They are not going to kill us.
You know why?

1194
01:20:05,255 --> 01:20:07,299
Why?
- 'Cause we were just...

1195
01:20:08,884 --> 01:20:10,510
Hold on!

1196
01:20:22,397 --> 01:20:24,816
Is that the same thing from the train?

1197
01:20:28,903 --> 01:20:30,447
Why are we stopping?

1198
01:20:31,531 --> 01:20:33,324
Contact with the precious cargo!

1199
01:20:35,493 --> 01:20:37,829
Driver, do you see anything out there?

1200
01:20:37,829 --> 01:20:39,706
No, sir, nothing!

1201
01:20:40,123 --> 01:20:41,541
What's that gun?

1202
01:20:43,001 --> 01:20:44,627
Sako Bolt Action 30W-6...

1203
01:20:44,627 --> 01:20:46,129
Okay, we get it.

1204
01:20:46,337 --> 01:20:49,299
Those aren't bullets.
He's loading tracking darts.

1205
01:20:49,340 --> 01:20:51,134
Here, tag it.

1206
01:20:56,848 --> 01:20:58,308
Yes sir.

1207
01:20:59,017 --> 01:21:00,560
Open the door!

1208
01:21:25,334 --> 01:21:27,128
Don't they give up this.

1209
01:21:33,342 --> 01:21:36,262
Sir, is there a particular area
that you want me to shoot?

1210
01:21:45,604 --> 01:21:47,106
Help!

1211
01:21:52,695 --> 01:21:54,739
Do something now!

1212
01:21:54,780 --> 01:21:55,865
Where are the fire powers?

1213
01:21:55,865 --> 01:21:59,076
There's a monster out there, Joe!
- Where the hell is it?

1214
01:22:06,041 --> 01:22:07,835
I got it, sir!

1215
01:22:21,432 --> 01:22:24,435
Guys, the seat-belt
is killing me! Come on!

1216
01:22:39,116 --> 01:22:42,077
This is Nelec. Use the big guns!

1217
01:22:42,077 --> 01:22:44,621
Whatever happens to me, do not let it...

1218
01:22:46,456 --> 01:22:48,542
Joe, open it!
- Open the door!

1219
01:22:48,584 --> 01:22:49,835
It's bolted!

1220
01:22:56,383 --> 01:22:59,344
Please, open it!
- Where are the keys?

1221
01:22:59,344 --> 01:23:03,098
Overmyer help me, my leg's stuck!

1222
01:23:03,098 --> 01:23:06,685
Please, sir, open the door.
Please, open the door!

1223
01:23:11,148 --> 01:23:13,400
Another one dead!

1224
01:23:14,359 --> 01:23:16,653
Guys, there's broken glass.

1225
01:23:17,529 --> 01:23:19,573
Martin, let me get up on your shoulders!

1226
01:23:19,823 --> 01:23:21,116
Go, go! Get up!

1227
01:23:21,116 --> 01:23:22,993
Here we go.
- Come on Joe!

1228
01:23:23,159 --> 01:23:24,077
Come on, you all!

1229
01:23:24,703 --> 01:23:27,539
You can do it, Joe! Let’s go!

1230
01:23:38,133 --> 01:23:39,926
Joe, you break the glass!

1231
01:24:01,197 --> 01:24:03,157
Come on guys, hurry!

1232
01:24:38,901 --> 01:24:40,987
We've got some questions
for you. Come on!

1233
01:24:41,404 --> 01:24:42,572
Is she dead?
- Just come with us.

1234
01:24:42,572 --> 01:24:44,156
Hey, fellows.

1235
01:24:44,156 --> 01:24:46,701
I got orders from Colonel Nelec to
personally deliver this man back to base.

1236
01:24:46,701 --> 01:24:48,786
He's all yours, Staff Sgt.

1237
01:24:48,995 --> 01:24:50,913
Let's go.
- What are you doing?

1238
01:24:51,580 --> 01:24:52,999
Where are we going?

1239
01:24:52,999 --> 01:24:54,792
To find our kids.

1240
01:24:58,421 --> 01:25:01,590
Guys, guys! I found them.

1241
01:25:02,842 --> 01:25:05,678
Hey guys, I found my firecrackers!

1242
01:25:05,678 --> 01:25:08,681
Congratulations!
- Look guys, they're coming back.

1243
01:25:08,681 --> 01:25:10,641
I think we should go! Come on!

1244
01:25:11,934 --> 01:25:13,644
Guys, come on!

1245
01:25:14,478 --> 01:25:15,688
No, look.

1246
01:25:19,566 --> 01:25:22,778
You dorks are alive! I thought...

1247
01:25:24,863 --> 01:25:27,408
What the fuck?
- Donnie, Donnie...

1248
01:25:27,408 --> 01:25:28,993
We need a ride into town.

1249
01:25:29,201 --> 01:25:33,205
Okay but just so you know,
I'm massively stoned right now.

1250
01:25:33,497 --> 01:25:35,290
Do you want me to drive?

1251
01:25:39,086 --> 01:25:40,462
Guys, what was that?

1252
01:25:40,587 --> 01:25:42,381
Sound like gun shots.
- Joe where are we going?

1253
01:25:42,381 --> 01:25:43,924
I saw something in the cemetery.

1254
01:25:43,924 --> 01:25:45,592
Woodward said it was subterranean.

1255
01:25:45,592 --> 01:25:47,010
I think I know where it is.

1256
01:25:47,010 --> 01:25:49,972
What the hell is that?
Turn the damn car!

1257
01:25:57,145 --> 01:26:00,315
Joe, turn the car around!
- I can't 'cause the tank's behind me!

1258
01:26:00,315 --> 01:26:03,610
Guys, we have to run!
Donnie, Donnie, wake up!

1259
01:26:03,610 --> 01:26:06,738
He's too stoned!
- Drugs are so bad!

1260
01:26:12,744 --> 01:26:14,538
Why are they firing?

1261
01:26:15,956 --> 01:26:17,707
Come on!

1262
01:26:17,833 --> 01:26:21,044
It's crazy, what is going on?

1263
01:26:23,171 --> 01:26:26,800
Sir, the weapons are misfiring!
All of them!

1264
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:30,679
Surface-to-air, radar,
it's a mess out here, sir.

1265
01:26:33,181 --> 01:26:36,184
Run!
- Come on!

1266
01:26:47,570 --> 01:26:49,406
What the hell?

1267
01:27:19,102 --> 01:27:20,770
Come on guys, move!

1268
01:27:20,770 --> 01:27:22,897
Did you guys see the explosions?

1269
01:27:22,897 --> 01:27:24,107
They were huge!

1270
01:27:24,232 --> 01:27:25,400
Oh, my God!

1271
01:27:28,069 --> 01:27:29,278
Whose house is this?

1272
01:27:29,278 --> 01:27:31,697
It's Kathy's. I got it of the fridge.

1273
01:27:31,781 --> 01:27:34,283
Kathy? I know her.

1274
01:27:34,325 --> 01:27:36,911
Charles, what are you drinking dude?
It's not yours!

1275
01:27:36,911 --> 01:27:39,121
I'm thirsty! I'm in a war zone!

1276
01:27:42,708 --> 01:27:44,627
Guys, come on, let's go!
- Where are we going?

1277
01:27:44,627 --> 01:27:46,087
To the cemetery...

1278
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:54,178
Guys, what happen to my legs? They hurt!

1279
01:27:55,513 --> 01:27:58,849
Oh shit, Martin, you got a
bone sticking out your leg!

1280
01:28:00,309 --> 01:28:03,145
Joe, give me that thing of the...

1281
01:28:04,730 --> 01:28:07,817
I got to go find Alice!
You guys stay here with Martin!

1282
01:28:08,192 --> 01:28:10,569
You going to be okay without me?

1283
01:28:10,861 --> 01:28:12,071
Yes!

1284
01:28:12,404 --> 01:28:16,033
I've got to go save the girl!
- Go on Cary! Shut up!

1285
01:28:16,867 --> 01:28:18,661
Come on!

1286
01:28:22,539 --> 01:28:25,167
Jesus, Martin, we haven't done it yet!

1287
01:28:36,303 --> 01:28:37,596
Just follow me.

1288
01:28:37,596 --> 01:28:39,098
I've been following you
for the last five blocks.

1289
01:28:39,098 --> 01:28:40,724
What are we doing here?

1290
01:28:40,933 --> 01:28:43,143
Come on, get these doors. Help me.

1291
01:28:43,143 --> 01:28:44,353
Help you with what?

1292
01:28:44,561 --> 01:28:46,230
We've to get inside.

1293
01:28:46,730 --> 01:28:48,148
Okay, for what?

1294
01:28:49,066 --> 01:28:50,609
I'll tell you in a second.

1295
01:28:50,609 --> 01:28:52,528
Why is there dirt on these windows?

1296
01:28:55,531 --> 01:28:57,866
At three, push.

1297
01:28:57,866 --> 01:29:02,162
One, two, three!

1298
01:29:09,753 --> 01:29:10,879
Wow!

1299
01:29:13,590 --> 01:29:15,092
This is scary.

1300
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:17,344
You got any sparklers in there?

1301
01:29:17,969 --> 01:29:19,888
Are you kidding me?

1302
01:29:31,816 --> 01:29:33,652
Alice is down there.

1303
01:29:48,249 --> 01:29:50,585
I came to your house that day,

1304
01:29:51,336 --> 01:29:55,548
to tell you that I never
meant to hurt anyone.

1305
01:29:56,925 --> 01:29:59,344
I swear to God.

1306
01:30:01,721 --> 01:30:04,224
I'm sorry, Jack.

1307
01:30:05,475 --> 01:30:08,144
About what happened to your wife.

1308
01:30:16,361 --> 01:30:18,571
It was an accident.

1309
01:30:25,578 --> 01:30:27,580
It 'was an accident.

1310
01:30:46,349 --> 01:30:48,893
Joe, I do not understand...

1311
01:30:51,562 --> 01:30:53,064
This way.

1312
01:31:49,286 --> 01:31:52,414
It's Sheriff Pruitt.
- I know, Cary look.

1313
01:31:55,584 --> 01:31:57,419
There are bodies everywhere.

1314
01:31:57,419 --> 01:32:01,006
What is this?
- Water from the water tower, look!

1315
01:32:09,348 --> 01:32:12,017
She got to be here. She got to be here.

1316
01:32:24,905 --> 01:32:27,532
It's eating a person.

1317
01:32:31,411 --> 01:32:34,789
She's here. Oh my God, she's here.

1318
01:32:35,207 --> 01:32:38,001
Cary, we need to use your firecrackers.

1319
01:32:38,543 --> 01:32:40,879
I don't think that is
going to hurt him, Joe.

1320
01:32:40,879 --> 01:32:43,256
There's other tunnels.
- So?

1321
01:32:43,298 --> 01:32:44,674
I need you to make noise.

1322
01:32:44,674 --> 01:32:46,217
Right here in 2 minutes.

1323
01:32:46,217 --> 01:32:48,386
Make it loud and make it last.

1324
01:32:48,386 --> 01:32:49,512
Use your sparklers.

1325
01:32:49,512 --> 01:32:51,848
Make sure you're gone when it blows.

1326
01:32:51,848 --> 01:32:54,267
You can't be here. You got to run!

1327
01:32:54,934 --> 01:32:56,936
Where are you going?

1328
01:33:31,721 --> 01:33:33,389
Come on, Cary.

1329
01:34:20,269 --> 01:34:22,396
Alice, please, wake up.

1330
01:34:22,688 --> 01:34:24,940
Alice, Alice.

1331
01:34:25,691 --> 01:34:27,693
Please, wake up! Alice!

1332
01:34:34,617 --> 01:34:38,662
You're alive! You're alive!
You're alive!

1333
01:34:38,787 --> 01:34:40,039
Are you okay? Can you hear me?

1334
01:34:40,039 --> 01:34:41,457
What is this?

1335
01:34:41,665 --> 01:34:42,958
What are you doing here?

1336
01:34:42,958 --> 01:34:45,544
I'm just doing the best
I can to safe you.

1337
01:34:54,928 --> 01:34:56,597
How did you know?

1338
01:34:56,889 --> 01:34:59,391
Your dad, he told me.

1339
01:34:59,391 --> 01:35:01,852
He was worried. He's flipping up.

1340
01:35:02,603 --> 01:35:04,354
Really?
- We have to move.

1341
01:35:04,563 --> 01:35:05,939
Excuse me.

1342
01:35:08,192 --> 01:35:09,735
Where are we?

1343
01:35:10,944 --> 01:35:13,447
I left my bag in the car and I when I...

1344
01:35:13,655 --> 01:35:15,324
He has been locked up for years.

1345
01:35:15,324 --> 01:35:18,285
He's terrified and hungry,
and he just wants to go home.

1346
01:35:18,285 --> 01:35:19,453
When he touched, I knew.

1347
01:35:19,453 --> 01:35:21,621
I need you help me get the sheriff down.

1348
01:35:33,216 --> 01:35:34,843
Follow me this way.
I'll get us out of here.

1349
01:35:34,843 --> 01:35:36,052
Sure, we came down...
- Don't argue with me!

1350
01:35:36,052 --> 01:35:37,053
You just follow me!

1351
01:35:37,053 --> 01:35:38,847
Come on kids, just go with the Sheriff.

1352
01:35:50,442 --> 01:35:51,484
This way.

1353
01:35:53,653 --> 01:35:55,155
Joe!

1354
01:35:57,115 --> 01:35:58,575
I told you to get out.
What are you doing here?

1355
01:35:58,575 --> 01:36:00,660
I just lost the way out, I tried.

1356
01:36:01,077 --> 01:36:02,287
Hey Alice, welcome back.

1357
01:36:02,287 --> 01:36:04,914
Hey! Come on, we got
to get out of here now!

1358
01:36:17,218 --> 01:36:18,845
She's gone! It took her!

1359
01:36:18,845 --> 01:36:20,430
I don't want to be next!

1360
01:36:42,493 --> 01:36:43,619
Go!

1361
01:36:43,745 --> 01:36:45,747
You don't want to be here! Go!

1362
01:36:45,747 --> 01:36:47,790
Joe, what are you doing?

1363
01:36:54,714 --> 01:36:56,757
What the hell is he doing?

1364
01:36:56,757 --> 01:36:58,342
We understand!

1365
01:37:01,971 --> 01:37:04,473
But not everyone is bad.

1366
01:37:19,530 --> 01:37:21,949
I know bad things happen.

1367
01:37:24,118 --> 01:37:26,120
Bad things happen.

1368
01:37:29,707 --> 01:37:32,042
But you can still live.

1369
01:37:36,046 --> 01:37:38,090
You can still live.

1370
01:38:20,090 --> 01:38:21,967
Okay, wait a minute.

1371
01:38:22,134 --> 01:38:23,385
What?

1372
01:39:10,890 --> 01:39:13,268
Look Out! Get down! Get down!

1373
01:39:50,596 --> 01:39:52,390
What are you doing?

1374
01:39:53,391 --> 01:39:55,560
He's making a model.

1375
01:40:39,687 --> 01:40:41,564
I got you.

1376
01:40:42,982 --> 01:40:44,984
I got you.
