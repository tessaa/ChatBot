1
00:00:03,721 --> 00:00:06,920
Steve Jobs was
a genius of the modern age.

2
00:00:06,922 --> 00:00:09,067
He gave us tools
to change our lives

3
00:00:09,069 --> 00:00:12,130
and the way we communicate.

4
00:00:12,132 --> 00:00:14,680
Here comes a device
that comes with no manual,

5
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:19,303
and everybody knows
how to use it... amazing.

6
00:00:19,305 --> 00:00:21,138
They weren't just hits in
the sense that they sold well,

7
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,809
but they actually changed
the whole nature of technology

8
00:00:24,811 --> 00:00:27,311
and caused everyone else
to follow them.

9
00:00:27,313 --> 00:00:30,479
This intimate portrait
is a revealing insight

10
00:00:30,481 --> 00:00:32,348
into Steve Jobs' life...

11
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:35,917
Andy Warhol gets
down on his hands and knees,

12
00:00:35,919 --> 00:00:37,988
Steve showing him
how to use the mouse.

13
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:39,052
His career...

14
00:00:40,342 --> 00:00:42,356
He shook up
a whole industry.

15
00:00:42,358 --> 00:00:43,568
His character...

16
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:45,500
Steve loved
those creative ideas.

17
00:00:45,502 --> 00:00:47,106
His faults...

18
00:00:47,108 --> 00:00:48,510
Steve ultimately
betrayed everyone.

19
00:00:48,512 --> 00:00:50,372
His artistry...

20
00:00:50,374 --> 00:00:52,868
Just the smooth
lines of it.

21
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:54,536
And his achievements...

22
00:00:54,538 --> 00:00:56,908
He is going to inspire
a whole new generation.

23
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,974
By the people
who knew him best.

24
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:01,911
I'd give a lot to have
Steve's taste.

25
00:01:02,951 --> 00:01:04,697
If he needed You,
he was your best friend,

26
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:06,088
and he would seduce you.

27
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,791
When I was having a hard time,
he would be on the phone,

28
00:01:07,793 --> 00:01:09,949
he'd drive up
from silicon valley,

29
00:01:09,951 --> 00:01:13,927
take me out for dinner,
hang out and take walks with me.

30
00:01:13,929 --> 00:01:16,528
He turned on me,
total street bully,

31
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,102
in my face, screa...
We were... and I went crazy.

32
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:20,308
I'd never been there.

33
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,042
I don't ever want
to be there again.

34
00:01:22,044 --> 00:01:25,081
How much fun we had... ohh...

35
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:27,519
How much fun we had in those
days doing things together,

36
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:32,210
you know, but you lose it,
you can't ever go back,

37
00:01:32,212 --> 00:01:37,722
and just to have those conversations
that make us both smile.

38
00:01:37,724 --> 00:01:40,369
Through their eyes,
we reveal what made him

39
00:01:40,371 --> 00:01:42,555
the man who always gave us...

40
00:01:42,557 --> 00:01:44,418
Now there's
one more thing.

41
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:47,855
Steve Jobs

42
00:01:47,856 --> 00:01:52,370
Steve Jobs
"One Last Thing"

43
00:01:52,544 --> 00:01:54,157
Mikhel for Subtitulos.es
==SPREAD THE WORD==

44
00:01:55,761 --> 00:01:59,668
Steven Paul Jobs died
on October 5, 2011,

45
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,799
at the age of 56,

46
00:02:02,801 --> 00:02:07,634
a life cut short
in its creative prime by cancer.

47
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:13,507
His death was
not a surprise,

48
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:17,687
and yet its impact
reverberated around the world.

49
00:02:24,286 --> 00:02:27,961
The news had spread,
and the tributes were created

50
00:02:27,963 --> 00:02:33,370
on the new iDevices that
his visionary genius had made.

51
00:02:33,372 --> 00:02:37,044
His is a success story that
could only have happened

52
00:02:37,046 --> 00:02:38,636
in the U.S.A.

53
00:02:38,638 --> 00:02:40,840
I don't mean to say
that there aren't geniuses

54
00:02:40,842 --> 00:02:44,141
and world-changing people
everywhere... there are...

55
00:02:44,143 --> 00:02:46,618
But I think in Jobs' case,

56
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,522
the particular path
of his career,

57
00:02:48,524 --> 00:02:50,718
this could only have
happened in America.

58
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,418
Steve Jobs'
world-class salesmanship found

59
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:57,494
a global audience in his famous
Apple product presentations.

60
00:02:57,496 --> 00:03:00,621
He always had
"one more thing" to announce.

61
00:03:00,623 --> 00:03:02,593
Everyone thinks, "wow.
That's... that's so much,"

62
00:03:02,595 --> 00:03:03,767
and, "well, we got
one more thing,"

63
00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:05,558
and then you put
your biggest thing at the end

64
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,297
because it'll tip it.

65
00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:11,737
It's good, uh... it's
good showmanship really.

66
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:14,306
Tragically
that "one more thing"

67
00:03:14,308 --> 00:03:19,509
has now become "one last thing."

68
00:03:19,511 --> 00:03:23,149
The news that Steve Jobs
had finally logged out

69
00:03:23,151 --> 00:03:26,259
made headlines everywhere.

70
00:03:26,261 --> 00:03:29,656
This man really had
changed the world.

71
00:03:32,961 --> 00:03:35,625
When you grow up,
you tend to get told

72
00:03:35,627 --> 00:03:37,924
that the world
is the way it is,

73
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:42,362
and your... your life is just to
live your life inside the world,

74
00:03:42,364 --> 00:03:45,337
try not to bash
into the walls too much,

75
00:03:45,339 --> 00:03:47,576
try to have
a nice family life,

76
00:03:47,578 --> 00:03:50,374
have fun, save a little money.

77
00:03:50,376 --> 00:03:53,647
In this exclusive,
never before seen interview,

78
00:03:53,649 --> 00:03:58,486
Steve Jobs gave a rare glimpse
of his vision of the world.

79
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,116
That's a very limited life.

80
00:04:00,118 --> 00:04:01,420
Life can be much broader

81
00:04:01,422 --> 00:04:03,822
once you discover
one simple fact,

82
00:04:03,824 --> 00:04:06,966
and that is everything
around you that you call life

83
00:04:06,968 --> 00:04:11,129
was made up by people that
were no smarter than you,

84
00:04:11,131 --> 00:04:13,599
and you can change it,
you can influence it,

85
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:18,670
you can build your own things
that other people can use.

86
00:04:18,672 --> 00:04:22,471
Um, once you learn that,
you'll never be the same again.

87
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:27,708
In the Los altos suburb

88
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:30,243
of San Francisco, California,

89
00:04:30,245 --> 00:04:32,851
just about everybody
was an engineer

90
00:04:32,853 --> 00:04:35,721
or worked in electronics

91
00:04:35,723 --> 00:04:39,690
a childhood spent here
in the future silicon valley

92
00:04:39,692 --> 00:04:45,435
was the first key lucky break
in Steve Jobs' young life.

93
00:04:45,437 --> 00:04:49,330
His closest childhood
friend was Bill Fernandez.

94
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,807
In about eighth grade,
halfway through,

95
00:04:54,809 --> 00:04:56,980
this new guy came
into the school,

96
00:04:56,982 --> 00:05:00,844
who was Steve Jobs,
and we were both introverted,

97
00:05:00,846 --> 00:05:03,845
intellectual,
kind of socially inept,

98
00:05:03,847 --> 00:05:06,680
and we gravitated
towards each other.

99
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:09,783
The two boys shared
the same hobby.

100
00:05:09,785 --> 00:05:11,553
We started taking long walks
and talking

101
00:05:11,555 --> 00:05:16,257
about the meaning of life
and what is this all about,

102
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:17,860
and after a while
we started doing...

103
00:05:17,862 --> 00:05:19,294
In addition to walking
and talking...

104
00:05:19,296 --> 00:05:21,832
Doing electronics
projects together.

105
00:05:21,834 --> 00:05:25,100
Fernandez also knew
another electronics geek,

106
00:05:25,102 --> 00:05:28,196
his neighbors' son
Steve Wozniak,

107
00:05:28,198 --> 00:05:31,039
universally known as Woz.

108
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:33,942
So one day, Steve Jobs bicycled
over to hang out with me

109
00:05:33,944 --> 00:05:36,012
and do electronics projects
in the garage,

110
00:05:36,014 --> 00:05:39,628
and out in front was Wozniak
washing his car.

111
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,488
So I thought to myself,
"ok. This Steve is

112
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:45,096
"an electronics buddy,
he's an electronics buddy.

113
00:05:45,098 --> 00:05:48,068
They'd probably like to
meet each other."

114
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,555
Fernandez
had no idea at the time

115
00:05:50,557 --> 00:05:53,141
that the meeting
between his two friends

116
00:05:53,143 --> 00:05:55,152
would change our world.

117
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:58,564
Jobs and Woz were soon to
start a business together.

118
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:01,164
Its name was Apple.

119
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:02,886
If Woz and Jobs
had never met,

120
00:06:02,888 --> 00:06:04,815
there never would have been
an Apple computer.

121
00:06:04,817 --> 00:06:06,645
There would have
been computers,

122
00:06:06,647 --> 00:06:08,859
and there would have
been personal computers,

123
00:06:08,861 --> 00:06:12,117
but we probably wouldn't have
the kind of

124
00:06:12,119 --> 00:06:13,990
wonderful empowering
things that people

125
00:06:13,992 --> 00:06:17,319
fall into if Woz
and Jobs hadn't met.

126
00:06:17,321 --> 00:06:19,352
This neighborhood
we grew up in had

127
00:06:19,354 --> 00:06:21,655
a lot of
lockheed engineers in it,

128
00:06:21,657 --> 00:06:24,434
and I would go up
and down the street

129
00:06:24,436 --> 00:06:26,100
to the various dads
on the street

130
00:06:26,102 --> 00:06:27,864
and get mentored
in electronics,

131
00:06:27,866 --> 00:06:30,364
and Steve Wozniak's father
was one of the people

132
00:06:30,366 --> 00:06:31,971
who mentored me.

133
00:06:31,973 --> 00:06:33,372
As Jobs and I were
walking over,

134
00:06:33,374 --> 00:06:35,240
I noticed Woz out
washing his car,

135
00:06:35,242 --> 00:06:39,108
and I said, "hey, Woz.
Um, come over and meet Steve."

136
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,244
So, "Steve, meet Steve."

137
00:06:41,246 --> 00:06:42,655
And this is where
it happened,

138
00:06:42,657 --> 00:06:45,419
basically right here.

139
00:06:45,421 --> 00:06:48,652
Woz and Jobs became
inseparable friends,

140
00:06:48,654 --> 00:06:51,852
but their first venture was not
a computer.

141
00:06:51,854 --> 00:06:54,294
The pair developed
an electronics Kit

142
00:06:54,296 --> 00:06:56,324
mimicking telephone
router codes

143
00:06:56,326 --> 00:06:58,763
to make free calls
around the world.

144
00:06:58,765 --> 00:07:00,096
You know, when you make
a long distance phone call

145
00:07:00,098 --> 00:07:02,370
in the background you hear,
"do do do do do"?

146
00:07:02,372 --> 00:07:05,337
Those are the telephone computers
actually signing each other,

147
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:07,408
sending information to each
other to set up your call.

148
00:07:09,272 --> 00:07:12,140
And there used to be
a way to fool

149
00:07:12,142 --> 00:07:13,908
the entire telephone system
into thinking

150
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:17,146
you were
a telephone computer.

151
00:07:17,148 --> 00:07:20,024
You could, you know,
call from a pay phone,

152
00:07:20,026 --> 00:07:22,487
go to white plains, new York,
take a satellite to Europe

153
00:07:22,489 --> 00:07:26,528
take a cable to turkey,
um, come back to Los Angeles,

154
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,054
and you'd go around the world
3 or 4 times and call

155
00:07:28,056 --> 00:07:30,631
the payphone next door,
shout in the phone,

156
00:07:30,633 --> 00:07:32,395
and be about 30 seconds, it
would come out the other phone.

157
00:07:33,808 --> 00:07:36,163
The pair quickly moved
on from phone-jacking for fun

158
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:39,869
to creating computers,
building the prototype

159
00:07:39,871 --> 00:07:43,146
of the very first Apple.

160
00:07:43,148 --> 00:07:46,656
It's a fond memory
for Steve Wozniak.

161
00:07:46,658 --> 00:07:49,446
He was always thinking
about certain technology,

162
00:07:49,448 --> 00:07:52,586
the early products that got
developed, the building parts,

163
00:07:52,588 --> 00:07:54,789
what those might lead to
in our future,

164
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:56,518
and he was a always pushing
me as an engineer...

165
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,191
"Could you possibly
add this someday,

166
00:07:58,193 --> 00:07:59,562
could you possibly add
that someday?"

167
00:07:59,564 --> 00:08:00,730
Yes, yes, yes, I could,"

168
00:08:00,732 --> 00:08:02,492
thinking, "no.
It's way, way off,"

169
00:08:02,494 --> 00:08:04,668
but eventually we all did.

170
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:08,218
In those early days,
Woz and Jobs took their creation

171
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,644
to the home-brew computer club,
an early computer club,

172
00:08:10,646 --> 00:08:13,875
an early computer users' group
in silicon valley,

173
00:08:13,877 --> 00:08:17,039
where it quickly attracted
attention from their peers.

174
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:24,954
I met both Steves,
Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak

175
00:08:24,956 --> 00:08:27,663
at a meeting
of the home-brew computer club

176
00:08:27,665 --> 00:08:29,861
in Palo Alto.

177
00:08:29,863 --> 00:08:31,162
Our first meeting
was really simple.

178
00:08:31,164 --> 00:08:32,919
It was in the parking lot,

179
00:08:32,921 --> 00:08:36,307
and I helped them
unload Woz's FIAT

180
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:40,680
and carried in what
I guess was the first Apple I

181
00:08:40,682 --> 00:08:44,298
to show it off
to the assembled multitudes.

182
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:48,310
When that same first
Apple I was auctioned in 2010,

183
00:08:48,312 --> 00:08:50,681
it attracted
even more attention.

184
00:08:50,683 --> 00:08:53,873
It heralds
the home computing revolution.

185
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:56,344
This is the first computer
where you use a keyboard

186
00:08:56,346 --> 00:08:59,784
and a screen
to enter and read data.

187
00:08:59,786 --> 00:09:05,219
Selling
for £110,000.

188
00:09:05,221 --> 00:09:09,257
From the hippie days
of 1970s California,

189
00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:12,046
a handful of teenage geeks
emerged to change

190
00:09:12,048 --> 00:09:17,507
how we work, play,
and communicate with each other.

191
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:19,715
Founders can be
divided into two camps.

192
00:09:19,717 --> 00:09:21,343
There are hippies,
and there are nerds,

193
00:09:21,345 --> 00:09:22,845
and Jobs was definitely
the hippie,

194
00:09:22,847 --> 00:09:24,378
and Woz was the nerd.

195
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,688
And the hippie has
the grand vision,

196
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:28,859
and the nerd is able
to realize the vision.

197
00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:30,735
The nerd knows everything
about women

198
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,011
but doesn't know any women.

199
00:09:32,013 --> 00:09:34,616
You know,
Steve knew women.

200
00:09:34,618 --> 00:09:36,697
So there's that distinction.

201
00:09:36,699 --> 00:09:38,904
So they really
needed each other.

202
00:09:38,906 --> 00:09:40,468
He knew how to beat it
out of Woz,

203
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,770
and he would do that,

204
00:09:41,772 --> 00:09:44,505
and his contributions
at that time were saying,

205
00:09:44,507 --> 00:09:46,868
"gosh. We could
sell these things."

206
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,452
I mean, which doesn't
sound like much,

207
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:51,418
but it's huge when you're
dealing with a guy in Woz

208
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,352
who never thought
about selling anything.

209
00:09:53,354 --> 00:09:55,375
I wanted it to happen
so badly,

210
00:09:55,377 --> 00:09:56,917
I gave this computer away.

211
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:59,586
I gave away the listings,
no copyright notices,

212
00:09:59,588 --> 00:10:01,421
no nothing,
and then Steve Jobs came

213
00:10:01,423 --> 00:10:03,053
and saw the interest,
and he said

214
00:10:03,055 --> 00:10:05,512
"why don't we start
a company to make some money?"

215
00:10:05,514 --> 00:10:06,648
And I said, "fine."

216
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:08,563
They did want
to start a business.

217
00:10:08,565 --> 00:10:10,830
They raised money to
start a business.

218
00:10:10,832 --> 00:10:13,257
They knew that they couldn't
do it on their own.

219
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:16,504
They sought out
older people to help,

220
00:10:16,506 --> 00:10:22,562
and Steve Jobs in particular
was quite persuasive.

221
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,015
In Apple's earliest
days, the two Steves,

222
00:10:28,017 --> 00:10:33,449
Jobs and Woz, took on an older
and more experienced partner.

223
00:10:33,451 --> 00:10:38,083
Ronald Wayne now lives
and works near Las Vegas,

224
00:10:38,085 --> 00:10:40,853
a fitting location for
a man who walked away

225
00:10:40,855 --> 00:10:46,455
with nothing from
a $37 billion no-lose bet.

226
00:10:52,293 --> 00:10:55,175
Wayne was invited to discuss
a business proposal

227
00:10:55,177 --> 00:10:57,458
with Jobs and Woz.

228
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,681
That was the first time
I had met Steve Wozniak,

229
00:10:59,683 --> 00:11:03,044
a fascinating guy
a fun guy to be with,

230
00:11:03,046 --> 00:11:05,472
very... not only a fun guy
to be with,

231
00:11:05,474 --> 00:11:07,874
the most gracious man
I've ever met in my life.

232
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:09,544
As far as Wozniak
was concerned,

233
00:11:09,546 --> 00:11:11,156
the world was
a great big sand box

234
00:11:11,158 --> 00:11:13,353
with a lot of toys
to play with.

235
00:11:13,355 --> 00:11:17,491
But Ron's opinion
of Steve Jobs was not so hot.

236
00:11:17,493 --> 00:11:19,824
I wouldn't put gracious
in his description.

237
00:11:19,826 --> 00:11:24,530
He had the kind of manner,
the kind of approach to people

238
00:11:24,532 --> 00:11:29,401
and environments that
were business directed, ok?

239
00:11:29,403 --> 00:11:33,971
He was extremely serious.

240
00:11:33,973 --> 00:11:37,239
Wayne acted as referee
in a minor difference of opinion

241
00:11:37,241 --> 00:11:40,944
between the two equal partners.

242
00:11:40,946 --> 00:11:43,584
Well, Steve Jobs was
so impressed

243
00:11:43,586 --> 00:11:46,785
with my diplomacy
in that particular situation

244
00:11:46,787 --> 00:11:48,553
that he immediately
came back and said,

245
00:11:48,555 --> 00:11:51,661
"ok. What we're going
to do is form a company,"

246
00:11:51,663 --> 00:11:55,131
with Woz and Jobs
getting 45% each,

247
00:11:55,133 --> 00:11:59,730
and I would get 10%
as a tiebreaker

248
00:11:59,732 --> 00:12:01,903
in the event
of any philosophical disputes

249
00:12:01,905 --> 00:12:04,167
that might occur
in the future.

250
00:12:04,169 --> 00:12:07,141
10% of Apple
today would be worth

251
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:17,185
$37,631,420,312.42,

252
00:12:17,187 --> 00:12:19,478
but despite his share
in the company,

253
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,250
Ron was worried
that working with Jobs and Woz

254
00:12:22,252 --> 00:12:24,797
might prove to be
too stressful.

255
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:28,725
At 40, I thought I was getting
a little old for that.

256
00:12:28,727 --> 00:12:30,464
They were absolute whirlwinds.

257
00:12:30,466 --> 00:12:33,063
It was like having
a tiger by the tail.

258
00:12:33,065 --> 00:12:35,672
So Ron decided
to hand back his share

259
00:12:35,674 --> 00:12:40,506
for nothing and walk
away with no regrets.

260
00:12:40,508 --> 00:12:42,246
A lot of people
have the impression

261
00:12:42,248 --> 00:12:44,382
that somehow or other I got
diddled out of something.

262
00:12:44,384 --> 00:12:47,276
Well, I did not.
Nobody diddled me out of anything.

263
00:12:52,619 --> 00:12:54,230
Wayne may not be bitter,

264
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:56,893
but he wasn't the only
early Apple employee

265
00:12:56,895 --> 00:13:00,427
who made a life decision
most of us would regret.

266
00:13:00,429 --> 00:13:03,337
The funny thing is that
Steve Jobs hired me,

267
00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:09,199
and he said... he had hair just
down to his waist at the time,

268
00:13:09,201 --> 00:13:12,247
and as I recall
he only ate fruit,

269
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:16,951
and he said,
"we don't have very much loot,

270
00:13:16,953 --> 00:13:20,779
so we'd like to
pay you in stock."

271
00:13:20,781 --> 00:13:23,411
I held out for the cash.

272
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:29,422
When Steve Jobs
first launched Apple,

273
00:13:29,424 --> 00:13:33,219
the computer industry meant
mainframes and minicomputers.

274
00:13:33,221 --> 00:13:36,029
Huge devices sat
in air conditioned rooms,

275
00:13:36,031 --> 00:13:38,700
and users worked
on terminals.

276
00:13:38,702 --> 00:13:41,361
It wasn't
a personal experience.

277
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:42,931
The Apple II was
the first computer

278
00:13:42,933 --> 00:13:46,633
that looked like
a consumer electronic device.

279
00:13:46,635 --> 00:13:49,077
It was actually designed,
and they thought

280
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:50,338
about the user experience

281
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,451
and that it was intended
really to be used

282
00:13:52,453 --> 00:13:55,517
by a single person
in some interactive way

283
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:01,149
that was enjoyable
to the user, different.

284
00:14:01,151 --> 00:14:03,419
Steve always
thought much more broadly

285
00:14:03,421 --> 00:14:05,453
than just technology.

286
00:14:05,455 --> 00:14:07,320
He was certainly
a techno-visionary,

287
00:14:07,322 --> 00:14:11,002
but the key to his greatness is
to see how broad he thought.

288
00:14:11,004 --> 00:14:15,227
He was obsessed with design,
with elegant design,

289
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:18,707
and he was obsessed
with the overall experience

290
00:14:18,709 --> 00:14:23,186
of technology and the idea
of creativity generally.

291
00:14:23,188 --> 00:14:26,978
So somehow he was able
to bring these things together

292
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,778
and create technology that
made peoples' eyes light up.

293
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:34,915
And I wait 8 hours
in a line,

294
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:39,885
and I'm hungry,
I am everything you imagine,

295
00:14:39,887 --> 00:14:40,958
but I'm happy.

296
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,457
I wait for my iPad

297
00:14:42,459 --> 00:14:46,197
and really, really,
really happy now.

298
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:49,137
Jobs drew on a diverse
range of influences to feed

299
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:52,509
his creativity, including
a class he dropped into

300
00:14:52,511 --> 00:14:56,920
at college in Portland, Oregon,
in the early seventies.

301
00:14:56,922 --> 00:14:59,717
Reed college has one
of the best calligraphy courses

302
00:14:59,719 --> 00:15:01,226
in the U.S.

303
00:15:01,228 --> 00:15:04,279
His teacher had a major impact
on his aesthetic

304
00:15:04,281 --> 00:15:06,261
and the clean lines
of his products.

305
00:15:11,473 --> 00:15:14,247
We had many very bright
students here,

306
00:15:14,249 --> 00:15:16,244
d we had bright thinkers

307
00:15:16,246 --> 00:15:18,278
and people that wanted
to change things

308
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,233
and improve the world.

309
00:15:20,235 --> 00:15:22,378
But Palladino
witnessed first hand

310
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,976
the impact Jobs
had on his peers.

311
00:15:24,978 --> 00:15:26,781
The other
students brought him to me

312
00:15:26,783 --> 00:15:30,689
like they were bringing me
someone very special.

313
00:15:30,691 --> 00:15:33,627
They really had
a high regard for him.

314
00:15:33,629 --> 00:15:36,424
I guess they could see
the dynamics

315
00:15:36,426 --> 00:15:40,819
already forming
in his thinking.

316
00:15:40,821 --> 00:15:43,958
Jobs completed
the course in 1974

317
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,473
but returned to palladino
just two years later.

318
00:15:46,475 --> 00:15:48,399
He was enthusing
about a machine he

319
00:15:48,401 --> 00:15:53,460
had created in his garage
and seeking advice on a font.

320
00:15:53,462 --> 00:15:55,971
He was interested in telling
me what he was doing

321
00:15:55,973 --> 00:15:58,107
and how he was using
what he had learned in class,

322
00:15:58,109 --> 00:16:02,219
but he wanted some help
with Greek letters

323
00:16:02,221 --> 00:16:05,514
because he wanted
a Greek font,

324
00:16:05,516 --> 00:16:10,015
and he couldn't find
satisfactory models to go from.

325
00:16:10,017 --> 00:16:14,131
Before Steve started working
on computer typefaces,

326
00:16:14,133 --> 00:16:18,162
they were in very bad condition,
and any improvement

327
00:16:18,164 --> 00:16:21,360
would be a step forward.

328
00:16:21,362 --> 00:16:24,614
The resulting fonts
appeared not just on Macs

329
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:26,796
but ultimately PCs, too,

330
00:16:26,798 --> 00:16:30,062
dramatically improving
the user experience

331
00:16:30,064 --> 00:16:31,946
but not for Robert.

332
00:16:31,948 --> 00:16:33,508
I never touch computers.

333
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:36,910
I write everything by hand.

334
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:40,459
Getting letters in the mail
is getting to be very rare.

335
00:16:48,819 --> 00:16:50,523
Dropping out of college,

336
00:16:50,525 --> 00:16:52,497
Jobs went on the hippie trail,

337
00:16:52,499 --> 00:16:55,998
traveling to India
and studying Buddhism,

338
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,342
this also had an impact
on his work at Apple.

339
00:17:00,344 --> 00:17:03,976
I first met Steve in 1975.

340
00:17:03,978 --> 00:17:06,192
He had recently returned
from India.

341
00:17:06,194 --> 00:17:08,210
He's way ahead of his time.

342
00:17:08,212 --> 00:17:10,219
He wasn't
the typical teenager.

343
00:17:10,221 --> 00:17:13,986
He asked questions that t re
a lot more serious

344
00:17:13,988 --> 00:17:16,823
than the normal 20-year-old.

345
00:17:16,825 --> 00:17:19,731
He was looking to understand
the true nature of things,

346
00:17:19,733 --> 00:17:21,588
and I think he came
to the zen center

347
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:24,895
Toto continue his search.

348
00:17:24,897 --> 00:17:29,532
Steve was very much taken
with Zen, Zen Buddhism.

349
00:17:29,534 --> 00:17:32,867
Zen represents
the relationship between things,

350
00:17:32,869 --> 00:17:34,533
things of the world.

351
00:17:34,535 --> 00:17:36,915
In zen, it's expressed
in the art.

352
00:17:36,917 --> 00:17:39,518
You see it in flower
arranging, Ikebana,

353
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,258
you see it calligraphy,
you see it in in artworks.

354
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,624
Steve was very much taken
with that

355
00:17:45,626 --> 00:17:47,331
and especially calligraphy.

356
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:52,848
He noticed the way the lines and
the spaces had a relationship.

357
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:56,621
I think his genius was being
able to take the principles

358
00:17:56,623 --> 00:17:59,558
of zen and incorporate it
into the products

359
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,067
that came out of Apple.

360
00:18:04,948 --> 00:18:08,230
Jobs freely acknowledged how
these outside influences

361
00:18:08,232 --> 00:18:09,565
had affected him.

362
00:18:09,567 --> 00:18:13,237
He was always trying
to look for external references

363
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:15,173
and external influences,

364
00:18:15,175 --> 00:18:17,882
and he'd talk about, you know, his
Mercedes was beautifully designed

365
00:18:17,884 --> 00:18:20,917
because those German guys were
thinking beautiful thoughts, I guess.

366
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:22,079
He loved aphorisms.

367
00:18:22,081 --> 00:18:25,652
You know, Picasso said,
"good artists copy,

368
00:18:25,654 --> 00:18:26,851
great artists steal,"

369
00:18:26,853 --> 00:18:28,692
and he loved to say that.

370
00:18:28,694 --> 00:18:29,925
He was the guy
who came with

371
00:18:29,927 --> 00:18:31,491
"something would be
insanely great."

372
00:18:31,493 --> 00:18:34,160
What does that mean?

373
00:18:34,162 --> 00:18:35,993
Much of what Apple did was built

374
00:18:35,995 --> 00:18:38,159
on the efforts of others.

375
00:18:38,161 --> 00:18:43,065
A 1979 deal gave him access
to Xerox technology,

376
00:18:43,067 --> 00:18:47,109
one thing blew him away,
a prototype mouse.

377
00:18:47,111 --> 00:18:51,218
He gave his own team orders
to make one, only better.

378
00:18:55,374 --> 00:18:58,295
"You got to build it
for less than 15 bucks,

379
00:18:58,297 --> 00:19:00,590
"it's got to last two years,

380
00:19:00,592 --> 00:19:02,356
"I want it to work
on the desktop,

381
00:19:02,358 --> 00:19:04,740
"a normal formica desktop,

382
00:19:04,742 --> 00:19:09,322
and I also want to be able
to use it on my jeans."

383
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,885
As I left the meeting
headed out to my car,

384
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:17,984
I was thinking,
"does this really make sense?

385
00:19:17,986 --> 00:19:21,302
Is Steve crazy
or is there something here?"

386
00:19:21,304 --> 00:19:23,113
If Steve
wanted something,

387
00:19:23,115 --> 00:19:25,976
his team just had to innovate,

388
00:19:25,978 --> 00:19:28,984
so for dean n at meant a trip
to the drug store.

389
00:19:28,986 --> 00:19:30,150
As I entered Walgreens,

390
00:19:30,152 --> 00:19:32,834
I had in my mind
most importantly was,

391
00:19:32,836 --> 00:19:34,453
"where do I find
these spheres,

392
00:19:34,455 --> 00:19:37,563
these balls to be a part
of the mouse?"

393
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:41,731
And I had thought
about the underarm deodorant

394
00:19:41,733 --> 00:19:43,659
as the right solution.

395
00:19:43,661 --> 00:19:45,468
And I emerged with some
roll-on deodorant

396
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:46,806
and a butter dish.

397
00:19:46,808 --> 00:19:49,141
And as you can see here,
there are of course

398
00:19:49,143 --> 00:19:50,866
different sized balls,

399
00:19:50,868 --> 00:19:55,040
depending upon how
it is applied.

400
00:19:55,042 --> 00:19:57,785
Not only that,
but then, once I had the balls,

401
00:19:57,787 --> 00:19:59,886
I said, that's a quick
way to have a structure

402
00:19:59,888 --> 00:20:03,151
to put around the ball so that I
can start interacting with it?"

403
00:20:03,153 --> 00:20:06,330
I remember going to
the house wares area,

404
00:20:06,332 --> 00:20:11,969
and I found a butter dish
which was about this big,

405
00:20:11,971 --> 00:20:14,321
and that became
the beginning part

406
00:20:14,323 --> 00:20:16,905
for the mouse, as I felt it.

407
00:20:16,907 --> 00:20:19,115
So I used the butter dish,
the roll-on ball

408
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:21,011
and was able to create
a prototype.

409
00:20:23,298 --> 00:20:26,345
It's hard to believe
that in a design so small

410
00:20:26,347 --> 00:20:28,072
as something that fits
in your hand

411
00:20:28,074 --> 00:20:30,640
there could be much
controversy around it,

412
00:20:30,642 --> 00:20:33,776
but it turns out there
was one major controversy,

413
00:20:33,778 --> 00:20:36,709
which was how
many buttons should there be?

414
00:20:36,711 --> 00:20:40,215
The original Xerox PARC
had 3 buttons,

415
00:20:40,217 --> 00:20:43,228
and there was a great debate about
how many buttons were right,

416
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:49,021
and Steve always had
the notion of simplicity.

417
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:52,275
The magic of Apple products
is simple.

418
00:20:52,277 --> 00:20:56,595
There was one button,
and it's magic.

419
00:20:56,597 --> 00:21:00,271
From the early days,
one man influenced Steve Jobs

420
00:21:00,273 --> 00:21:05,213
more than any other,
his friend and rival Bill Gates.

421
00:21:09,446 --> 00:21:13,386
Apple's history interweaves
with Microsoft's.

422
00:21:13,388 --> 00:21:15,547
Their CEOs gave
a unique interview

423
00:21:15,549 --> 00:21:17,719
to journalist
Walter Mossberg.

424
00:21:17,721 --> 00:21:20,055
It was
to my knowledge the only time

425
00:21:20,057 --> 00:21:23,528
they ever got onstage
together to submit themselves

426
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:26,966
to an extended interview
with journalists.

427
00:21:26,968 --> 00:21:29,802
Their interview gave
Walt unparalleled insights

428
00:21:29,804 --> 00:21:32,971
into the dynamics
of their relationship.

429
00:21:32,973 --> 00:21:34,338
But then there was
a floating...

430
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:36,244
From the start,
Gates was overshadowed

431
00:21:36,246 --> 00:21:39,578
by the more polished,
confident Jobs.

432
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,610
I made... I...

433
00:21:40,612 --> 00:21:43,280
Let me tell the story.
So Woz...

434
00:21:45,251 --> 00:21:47,850
I'm not
fake Steve Jobs.

435
00:21:51,152 --> 00:21:55,521
If you saw them together, Steve
always dominated the conversation.

436
00:21:55,523 --> 00:22:00,739
In part that's because I think Bill
was always fascinated by Steve.

437
00:22:00,741 --> 00:22:05,434
He was a real observer, and he would
just look at this guy and say,

438
00:22:05,436 --> 00:22:07,209
"what the heck
is going on here?"

439
00:22:07,211 --> 00:22:09,744
We've kept our marriage
secret for over a decade now.

440
00:22:15,425 --> 00:22:21,031
He admired Steve for his ability
to interface with people,

441
00:22:21,033 --> 00:22:23,631
connect with them,
you know, affect them.

442
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:26,158
They were partners,
you know, for a long time.

443
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:30,865
The very first Apple II computers
had Microsoft software in them.

444
00:22:30,867 --> 00:22:33,331
But while
the banter was good-natured,

445
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:36,397
the rivalry between the two
was deep-rooted.

446
00:22:36,399 --> 00:22:39,374
I personally can
attest to having heard

447
00:22:39,376 --> 00:22:42,969
each of them say very nasty
things about the other

448
00:22:42,971 --> 00:22:46,650
off the record in private
over the years.

449
00:22:46,652 --> 00:22:51,343
I think the antipathy partly
grew out of two things.

450
00:22:51,345 --> 00:22:55,854
On Jobs' side,
he believed that Microsoft

451
00:22:55,856 --> 00:22:59,603
had stolen
the basic ideas in the Mac.

452
00:22:59,605 --> 00:23:01,521
From the point of view
of Gates, I think,

453
00:23:01,523 --> 00:23:03,757
he found Jobs difficult
to deal with.

454
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:05,830
Steve is so know
for his restraint.

455
00:23:07,836 --> 00:23:12,566
I think Gates felt
that Jobs got more credit

456
00:23:12,568 --> 00:23:16,138
than he might have deserved
as being the great technologist.

457
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:19,716
Neither person is
hugely likable.

458
00:23:19,718 --> 00:23:21,857
Certainly Steve Jobs is
an acquired taste,

459
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:23,848
and so is Bill Gates
for that matter.

460
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:26,652
Um, they both have
their moments.

461
00:23:26,654 --> 00:23:30,233
Bill Gates is a a better friend
than Steve Jobs,

462
00:23:30,235 --> 00:23:34,068
but Steve Jobs is more
fun than Bill Gates.

463
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:37,094
Jobs had
glamour and dynamism.

464
00:23:37,096 --> 00:23:39,660
By the mid 1980s,
he was one of the richest

465
00:23:39,662 --> 00:23:41,966
self-made men in America.

466
00:23:41,968 --> 00:23:43,870
He was just 29.

467
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,467
People are going to bring
them home over the weekend

468
00:23:45,469 --> 00:23:47,693
to work on something
Sunday morning.

469
00:23:47,695 --> 00:23:49,442
They're not going to be able to
get their kids away from them,

470
00:23:49,444 --> 00:23:51,147
and maybe someday
they'll even buy a second one

471
00:23:51,149 --> 00:23:53,272
to leave at home.

472
00:23:53,274 --> 00:23:59,115
Which made him
a natural subject for "playboy."

473
00:23:59,117 --> 00:24:01,381
Interviewing Jobs was
a unique experience

474
00:24:01,383 --> 00:24:03,527
for writer David Sheff.

475
00:24:03,529 --> 00:24:04,960
The phone rung one day,

476
00:24:04,962 --> 00:24:06,551
and it was not
a PR person who called,

477
00:24:06,553 --> 00:24:10,126
but it was Jobs himself,
and it really was

478
00:24:10,128 --> 00:24:12,291
an indication of the way
that he did business

479
00:24:12,293 --> 00:24:15,028
and really continued
to do business.

480
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,800
Apple was very different.
The second you walked in the door,

481
00:24:16,802 --> 00:24:19,902
you felt like you were
in a completely new environment.

482
00:24:19,904 --> 00:24:21,972
The conference rooms
instead of, you know,

483
00:24:21,974 --> 00:24:25,740
of number 103c were called
Da Vinci and Michelangelo

484
00:24:25,742 --> 00:24:29,711
and Picasso,
and indeed it was Picasso

485
00:24:29,713 --> 00:24:34,757
that I was escorted to
to see Jobs for the first time.

486
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:36,689
As the two got
Toto know each other,

487
00:24:36,691 --> 00:24:39,162
Sheff realized he had
a front row seat

488
00:24:39,164 --> 00:24:43,235
on what was then an unimaginable
technological future.

489
00:24:43,237 --> 00:24:45,426
Steve started
drawing on a place mat.

490
00:24:45,428 --> 00:24:47,593
We went back and forth,
and basically by the end

491
00:24:47,595 --> 00:24:51,572
of that constructed what looks
exactly like an iPad.

492
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:53,209
Steve said this machine,

493
00:24:53,211 --> 00:24:55,879
this small device
as big as a book,

494
00:24:55,881 --> 00:24:59,344
would allow us to keep
in touch with one another,

495
00:24:59,346 --> 00:25:03,443
it will replace the telephone
and would replace bookstores.

496
00:25:03,445 --> 00:25:06,845
He saw it as a reader
on this very small device

497
00:25:06,847 --> 00:25:10,452
and read it with editing
capacity, note-taking capacity.

498
00:25:10,454 --> 00:25:13,668
I mean, he really envisioned
the iPad almost 30 years ago.

499
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:17,466
Jobs and sheff quickly
became close friends.

500
00:25:17,468 --> 00:25:20,234
Through the late sixties
and seventies

501
00:25:20,236 --> 00:25:24,168
in very similar ways, gong through
some of the counter culture,

502
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:27,464
you know being, influenced by
some of the eastern mysticism,

503
00:25:27,466 --> 00:25:30,742
buddhism, the LSD culture,
Timothy leary.

504
00:25:30,744 --> 00:25:36,197
Turn on, tune in, rock out.

505
00:25:36,199 --> 00:25:38,779
He was always so excited
about everything,

506
00:25:38,781 --> 00:25:39,846
and we went to movies together,

507
00:25:39,848 --> 00:25:41,018
and we went
to the opera together,

508
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,292
and he could talk
about everything,

509
00:25:42,294 --> 00:25:45,891
and he was this incredibly
giving, loyal friend.

510
00:25:45,893 --> 00:25:47,595
When I was having a hard time,
we'd be on the phone,

511
00:25:47,597 --> 00:25:49,456
he'd drive up
from silicon valley,

512
00:25:49,458 --> 00:25:51,428
take me out to dinner,
hang out,

513
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:57,369
and take walks with me,
and, um, that's pretty rare.

514
00:25:57,371 --> 00:26:01,207
In 1984, they visited
the home of Yoko Ono

515
00:26:01,209 --> 00:26:03,507
for the ninth birthday party
of Sean,

516
00:26:03,509 --> 00:26:05,846
her son with John Lennon.

517
00:26:05,848 --> 00:26:08,877
Jobs took along a birthday
gift that fascinated

518
00:26:08,879 --> 00:26:13,517
not only Sean but the whole
star-studded guest list.

519
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:16,516
Steve opened it up,
pulled out what was

520
00:26:16,518 --> 00:26:20,429
one of those first Macintoshes
off the assembly line,

521
00:26:20,431 --> 00:26:22,359
set it up on the floor.

522
00:26:22,361 --> 00:26:25,207
Sean was down on the floor
with him, Steve turned it on,

523
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:26,828
put macpaint in there.

524
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:29,472
It took him about two seconds to
show Sean how to deal with it,

525
00:26:29,474 --> 00:26:32,669
and Sean pretty soon
was drawing pictures.

526
00:26:32,671 --> 00:26:34,642
Later Steve told me it was one
of the first times

527
00:26:34,644 --> 00:26:38,882
he'd watched a child
with a Mac.

528
00:26:38,884 --> 00:26:41,813
Eventually I sort of became aware
that there were some people who'd

529
00:26:41,815 --> 00:26:43,542
come in to the room,
and I looked over my shoulder,

530
00:26:43,544 --> 00:26:45,650
and there was Andy warhol.

531
00:26:45,652 --> 00:26:48,162
So there was this great moment
that I'll never forget.

532
00:26:48,164 --> 00:26:51,554
Andy warhol gets down
on his hands and knees

533
00:26:51,556 --> 00:26:54,396
with Sean on one side
and Steve on the other side.

534
00:26:54,398 --> 00:26:56,597
I member that warhol
would pick up the mouse,

535
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:58,359
and instead of gliding it
along the floor,

536
00:26:58,361 --> 00:27:00,365
the tiled floor
in Sean's bedroom,

537
00:27:00,367 --> 00:27:02,432
he would sort of pick it up
and was trying to figure out

538
00:27:02,434 --> 00:27:04,469
how to make it work,
and Steve very patiently

539
00:27:04,471 --> 00:27:05,865
would sort of lower
his hand down and say,

540
00:27:05,867 --> 00:27:07,478
"no. You kind of push it along."

541
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,182
So Andy sort of
fooled around with it,

542
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,374
and he was
completely mesmerized.

543
00:27:10,376 --> 00:27:11,974
I mean, when he zoned in
on something,

544
00:27:11,976 --> 00:27:13,183
the rest
of the world disappeared,

545
00:27:13,185 --> 00:27:15,785
and that was what it was like
watching warhol

546
00:27:15,787 --> 00:27:18,058
in front of a macintosh
for the first time.

547
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:21,118
And then he got this big smile
on his face, and he looked up.

548
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,695
He said, "I drew a circle."

549
00:27:23,697 --> 00:27:24,968
And it was great.

550
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:27,788
Life had been good
for Steve Jobs.

551
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:29,971
He was worth a million dollars
when he was 21.

552
00:27:29,973 --> 00:27:31,705
He was worth $10 million
when he was 22.

553
00:27:31,707 --> 00:27:34,643
He was worth $100 million
when he was 23 years old.

554
00:27:34,645 --> 00:27:37,649
So he knew nothing but success,
and when you're 23 years old,

555
00:27:37,651 --> 00:27:39,297
you're worth $100 million,

556
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:41,743
you are pretty damn
full of yourself,

557
00:27:41,745 --> 00:27:49,812
and that's what Steve became,
and so he had huge ambition.

558
00:27:49,814 --> 00:27:52,716
But in 1985
at the age of 30,

559
00:27:52,718 --> 00:27:58,592
his charmed run of luck was
about to come to an abrupt halt.

560
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:02,087
Seeking someone to help run his
rapidly expanding business,

561
00:28:02,089 --> 00:28:06,705
he hired in Pepsi executive
John Sculley.

562
00:28:06,707 --> 00:28:08,797
President John Sculley
admits Apple will be

563
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:12,005
just another personal computer
company unless macintosh

564
00:28:12,007 --> 00:28:16,134
becomes an industry milestone
in the n nt 100 days.

565
00:28:18,645 --> 00:28:21,354
There was kind of
a love affair at the beginning.

566
00:28:21,356 --> 00:28:23,246
I mean, Steve
really trusted him

567
00:28:23,248 --> 00:28:25,920
and really saw
a kindred spirit,

568
00:28:25,922 --> 00:28:28,719
someone who would help him
build Apple.

569
00:28:28,721 --> 00:28:30,192
His love was Apple.

570
00:28:30,194 --> 00:28:33,553
He envisioned being
with Apple for his life.

571
00:28:33,555 --> 00:28:35,959
He said, "but that doesn't
mean there won't be periods

572
00:28:35,961 --> 00:28:37,823
"when I will leave
and I will do other things

573
00:28:37,825 --> 00:28:40,929
and my life will
weave in and out of Apple."

574
00:28:40,931 --> 00:28:43,942
Once again,
Jobs' foresight was spot on.

575
00:28:43,944 --> 00:28:46,479
Two years after Sculley
arrived at Apple,

576
00:28:46,481 --> 00:28:50,782
the love affair turned sour
as company profits faltered.

577
00:28:50,784 --> 00:28:53,786
Steve was never
fired from Apple,

578
00:28:53,788 --> 00:28:57,547
but he was ostracized
and demoted

579
00:28:57,549 --> 00:29:02,295
and put in an office
in an empty building,

580
00:29:02,297 --> 00:29:06,522
and after that he...
He resigned in 1985

581
00:29:06,524 --> 00:29:09,605
and then immediately sold his
more than 6 million shares...

582
00:29:09,607 --> 00:29:11,766
He was the largest single
shareholder of Apple at the time,

583
00:29:11,768 --> 00:29:16,017
and sold his stock
at a bad price

584
00:29:16,019 --> 00:29:18,539
and didn't get as much money
as he should have

585
00:29:18,541 --> 00:29:21,572
or could have had he done it
smartly, but he was angry.

586
00:29:21,574 --> 00:29:26,121
He felt so betrayed,
so angry, so disillusioned

587
00:29:26,123 --> 00:29:31,321
that Sculley was, in his mind,
at least part of

588
00:29:31,323 --> 00:29:34,074
if not the ringleader in what
he viewed as a coup

589
00:29:34,076 --> 00:29:38,384
to remove him,
and Steve was pissed off,

590
00:29:38,386 --> 00:29:41,631
and he was really pissed off
about Sculley

591
00:29:41,633 --> 00:29:44,869
because he brought Sculley
in and trusted him

592
00:29:44,871 --> 00:29:47,903
and then felt betrayed by him.

593
00:29:47,905 --> 00:29:51,621
So he sold his stock
and he went off,

594
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,774
took his tens of millions
of dollars

595
00:29:52,776 --> 00:29:54,905
but not hundreds
of millions of dollars

596
00:29:54,907 --> 00:29:58,006
and started a new life.

597
00:29:58,008 --> 00:30:00,042
But there were still
people willing to back him

598
00:30:00,044 --> 00:30:01,709
with hard cash.

599
00:30:01,711 --> 00:30:04,187
One of them was self-made
texan billionaire

600
00:30:04,189 --> 00:30:07,554
and former presidential
candidate Ross Perot.

601
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:11,561
He saw how wounded Jobs
had been by Apple.

602
00:30:11,563 --> 00:30:15,771
I think at first it was
a tremendous disappointment,

603
00:30:15,773 --> 00:30:17,840
which I can
certainly understand.

604
00:30:17,842 --> 00:30:22,783
Secondly, he picked himself up,
dusted himself off,

605
00:30:22,785 --> 00:30:26,279
and started all over again
with very little hesitation,

606
00:30:26,281 --> 00:30:28,585
and I really admired that.

607
00:30:28,587 --> 00:30:31,057
You know, otherwise you could
sit around in a dark room

608
00:30:31,059 --> 00:30:33,774
and sulk about it,
but that's not Steve.

609
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:39,199
Steve started
a company called NeXT

610
00:30:39,201 --> 00:30:42,151
to do a computer that was
gonna be what he thought

611
00:30:42,153 --> 00:30:44,001
Apple should have been.

612
00:30:44,003 --> 00:30:47,198
Uh, to aim it at the education
market because they...

613
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,454
Apple had had conspicuous
success in education.

614
00:30:49,456 --> 00:30:51,085
There were some people
he could steal from Apple

615
00:30:51,087 --> 00:30:52,730
to market to that segment,

616
00:30:52,732 --> 00:30:55,899
and he thought
starting small made sense.

617
00:30:55,901 --> 00:31:00,021
But even starting
small needs big money.

618
00:31:00,023 --> 00:31:02,217
I invested $20 millions in NeXT.

619
00:31:02,219 --> 00:31:04,945
He contacted me, asked me
to be a principal investor

620
00:31:04,947 --> 00:31:06,811
and to serve
on the board with him,

621
00:31:06,813 --> 00:31:11,148
and I agreed to do it just
because of my support for him,

622
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:13,854
and there was no question
in my mind that if he...

623
00:31:13,856 --> 00:31:17,532
If he wanted to do it,
it would get done.

624
00:31:17,534 --> 00:31:19,894
He's great with attracting
and motivating

625
00:31:19,896 --> 00:31:21,503
the best of the best people.

626
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:25,370
He's great at encouraging
men to be creative

627
00:31:25,372 --> 00:31:28,708
and come up with new ideas
and not just be little robots,

628
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:32,244
which many big companies just
want you to be a little robot

629
00:31:32,246 --> 00:31:34,149
and do what you're told to do,

630
00:31:34,151 --> 00:31:37,655
and the last thing they want to
hear from you is a creative idea.

631
00:31:37,657 --> 00:31:40,019
Steve loved those
creative ideas,

632
00:31:40,021 --> 00:31:43,893
and that was a magic part
of the success of NeXT.

633
00:31:43,895 --> 00:31:47,029
A new Steve Jobs was
rising out of the ashes

634
00:31:47,031 --> 00:31:49,396
of the boardroom battle
at Apple,

635
00:31:49,398 --> 00:31:51,652
and this time he was ruthless.

636
00:31:54,630 --> 00:32:03,552
He invested $5 million capital
in a corporation called Pixar,

637
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:08,943
and he took 70% of the company,
and the employees took 30%.

638
00:32:08,945 --> 00:32:13,677
Steve kept investing because
we would run out of money

639
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:18,055
and he did not want to be
embarrassed by failure

640
00:32:18,057 --> 00:32:19,462
after having been
booted out of Apple,

641
00:32:19,464 --> 00:32:22,692
so he would put more money in

642
00:32:22,694 --> 00:32:24,860
and take more equity away
from the employees.

643
00:32:24,862 --> 00:32:26,889
So over the course
of about 4 or 5 years,

644
00:32:26,891 --> 00:32:29,354
he owned it all.

645
00:32:29,356 --> 00:32:31,512
Alvy quickly
felt he was losing control

646
00:32:31,514 --> 00:32:32,768
to the new master.

647
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:35,277
I would look at my employees
looking at Steve,

648
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,309
and I realized they're in love.

649
00:32:37,311 --> 00:32:42,483
They're just looking up
at him with big Doe eyes

650
00:32:42,485 --> 00:32:45,224
just soaking in
everything he's saying

651
00:32:45,226 --> 00:32:47,576
as if it was true,
and it wasn't.

652
00:32:47,578 --> 00:32:49,243
So you can see that
it was very disruptive.

653
00:32:49,245 --> 00:32:52,577
Our management style was
to be two hours away from him,

654
00:32:52,579 --> 00:32:57,042
try not to have him come
into the building.

655
00:32:57,044 --> 00:32:59,794
Standing up to Jobs
could be a painful experience,

656
00:32:59,796 --> 00:33:03,223
as Alvy found out in one
memorable boardroom meeting.

657
00:33:03,225 --> 00:33:06,458
He turned on me,
total street bully,

658
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:09,037
in my face, scream...
We wer... and I went crazy.

659
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:10,211
I'd never been there.

660
00:33:10,213 --> 00:33:11,475
I don't ever want
to be there again.

661
00:33:11,477 --> 00:33:14,073
That's the reason
I got away from him.

662
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:17,179
We were screaming
at each other in full bull rage

663
00:33:17,181 --> 00:33:19,247
with our faces
about that far apart,

664
00:33:19,249 --> 00:33:21,418
and during that...
So he was insulting

665
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:24,421
my southwestern accent.

666
00:33:24,423 --> 00:33:26,089
It was just
street bully stuff.

667
00:33:26,091 --> 00:33:28,054
I ill don't know
what happened.

668
00:33:28,056 --> 00:33:34,159
Something broke.
And during this face-off...

669
00:33:34,161 --> 00:33:36,026
Literally a face-off...

670
00:33:36,028 --> 00:33:39,070
I marched past him
and wrote on the whiteboard.

671
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:40,739
Now it was
unspoken rule...

672
00:33:40,741 --> 00:33:43,469
Which I hate,
unspoken rules...

673
00:33:43,471 --> 00:33:45,507
That only he could sit
in front of the whiteboard

674
00:33:45,509 --> 00:33:47,908
and only he could use it.

675
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:49,410
Nobody had ever tested it,

676
00:33:49,412 --> 00:33:52,242
but at this point,
I tested it.

677
00:33:52,244 --> 00:33:53,809
I marched past him
and I wrote on the whiteboard,

678
00:33:53,811 --> 00:33:55,613
and he said,
"y-y-you can't do that.

679
00:33:55,615 --> 00:33:58,519
And I said,
"what? Write on a whiteboard?"

680
00:33:58,521 --> 00:34:00,983
And he stormed out
of the room,

681
00:34:00,985 --> 00:34:04,128
and then I was in shock
for the next week or moths.

682
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:05,594
I just didn't know
what had happened.

683
00:34:05,596 --> 00:34:08,613
Everyone in Steve Jobs' life
went through 3 phases...

684
00:34:08,615 --> 00:34:14,092
They were either being
seduced, ignored, or scourged,

685
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:17,010
and it all depended upon
whether he needed you or not.

686
00:34:17,012 --> 00:34:19,015
If he needed you,
he was your best friend,

687
00:34:19,017 --> 00:34:20,380
and he would seduce you,

688
00:34:20,382 --> 00:34:21,979
and then you would work
like a dog,

689
00:34:21,981 --> 00:34:24,120
and if you weren't working hard
enough, he would scourge you,

690
00:34:24,122 --> 00:34:25,657
and ultimately he would
throw you away.

691
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:28,232
On the personal level,
it was not fun,

692
00:34:28,234 --> 00:34:31,282
it was not the way I want to be
treated by another human being.

693
00:34:31,284 --> 00:34:33,882
Steve ultimately
betrayed everyone.

694
00:34:33,884 --> 00:34:36,681
And some said
the new Steve Jobs wasn't afraid

695
00:34:36,683 --> 00:34:38,917
of claiming
l the credit, too.

696
00:34:38,919 --> 00:34:41,456
Disney took "toy story"
and another one

697
00:34:41,458 --> 00:34:44,760
of their movies to new York
for the critics to see,

698
00:34:44,762 --> 00:34:47,194
and the critics just...
They didn't even look at the other movie.

699
00:34:47,196 --> 00:34:49,906
They just went nuts
when they saw "toy story,"

700
00:34:49,908 --> 00:34:51,937
and they came back
and basically told Steve

701
00:34:51,939 --> 00:34:53,408
that it was going to be
a huge success,

702
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:57,303
and that's when he... that's
the point his ability to see

703
00:34:57,305 --> 00:34:59,006
something spectacular
is about to happen.

704
00:34:59,008 --> 00:35:01,475
He just moved just in and
exploited that right to the hilt,

705
00:35:01,477 --> 00:35:02,818
and I must say he did
a great job.

706
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,484
He became
a billionaire from it.

707
00:35:04,486 --> 00:35:07,583
Awesome.

708
00:35:07,585 --> 00:35:10,650
So Steve's genius is to move
when he has a good idea.

709
00:35:10,652 --> 00:35:12,986
I don't think they're
necessarily his ideas,

710
00:35:12,988 --> 00:35:14,025
but, boy, does he know
how to move

711
00:35:14,027 --> 00:35:15,420
and market them like crazy.

712
00:35:15,422 --> 00:35:18,097
He the world's
genius marketeer,

713
00:35:18,099 --> 00:35:21,573
including of his own self-image.

714
00:35:21,575 --> 00:35:24,938
But the best
was yet to come for Jobs.

715
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,667
Apple was in trouble.

716
00:35:26,669 --> 00:35:28,634
They wanted him back.

717
00:35:28,636 --> 00:35:31,004
They were begging
him to come back

718
00:35:31,006 --> 00:35:33,051
because they knew
he could fix it,

719
00:35:33,053 --> 00:35:37,125
and he did come back,
and he fixed it,

720
00:35:37,127 --> 00:35:38,343
and the rest is history.

721
00:35:41,202 --> 00:35:44,151
One man who witnessed
Jobs' return to Apple

722
00:35:44,153 --> 00:35:46,818
was friend Walt Mossberg.

723
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:50,261
He came back to Apple,
and the company was almost dead.

724
00:35:50,263 --> 00:35:54,032
Literally. It was 90 days
from going bankrupt.

725
00:35:54,034 --> 00:35:58,765
He said to the people
at this very demoralized,

726
00:35:58,767 --> 00:36:00,667
almost out of business company,

727
00:36:00,669 --> 00:36:02,235
"we're not looking backward.

728
00:36:02,237 --> 00:36:05,150
"I don't really care
that we once had

729
00:36:05,152 --> 00:36:07,338
"the first successful
personal computer.

730
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:10,688
"I really don't care that we
were famous and successful.

731
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:15,814
"We're not anymore, and this
is where we're starting from,

732
00:36:15,816 --> 00:36:17,324
and this is where
we're moving."

733
00:36:17,326 --> 00:36:20,538
And so when you see the second
coming of Steve Jobs and Apple,

734
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:25,025
Apple went from being
a wide-open and wacky company

735
00:36:25,027 --> 00:36:29,077
to be a very
disciplined company

736
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:30,443
that understood
its financials

737
00:36:30,445 --> 00:36:33,378
at a level that
few companies do.

738
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:35,650
That's because Steve thought
of every dollar

739
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:37,354
as being his every dollar.

740
00:36:37,356 --> 00:36:40,450
They have resolved these
differences in a very, very...

741
00:36:40,452 --> 00:36:42,819
It was an investment
from Bill Gates

742
00:36:42,821 --> 00:36:45,343
that ultimately helped
to save Apple,

743
00:36:45,345 --> 00:36:47,416
but when Gates made
a a live appearance with Jobs

744
00:36:47,418 --> 00:36:50,390
to explain the deal,
it didn't go down well

745
00:36:50,392 --> 00:36:53,798
with the loyal
Apple audience.

746
00:36:56,661 --> 00:37:02,469
Bill Gates was actually onstage
rescuing Apple, rescuing Apple.

747
00:37:02,471 --> 00:37:04,166
He did two things.

748
00:37:04,168 --> 00:37:07,712
He gave them $150 million
for which he got

749
00:37:07,714 --> 00:37:10,313
nonvoting stock
that expired

750
00:37:10,315 --> 00:37:13,378
after a certain
number of years,

751
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:17,315
and he promised to
keep producing Microsoft office,

752
00:37:17,317 --> 00:37:21,782
the macintosh version,
for, I think, 5 years,

753
00:37:21,784 --> 00:37:24,984
and so he was onstage
rescuing Apple,

754
00:37:24,986 --> 00:37:30,897
and yet the acolytes
who were filling the room

755
00:37:30,899 --> 00:37:32,299
had learned to hate him.

756
00:37:32,301 --> 00:37:35,511
They treated him as,
you know the, devil,

757
00:37:35,513 --> 00:37:37,161
the antichrist,
and they booed him.

758
00:37:41,539 --> 00:37:43,947
But Jobs with his eye
ever on the bottom line,

759
00:37:43,949 --> 00:37:45,378
had a different view.

760
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:47,004
There were too many
people at Apple

761
00:37:47,006 --> 00:37:49,281
and in the Apple ecosystem
playing the game of

762
00:37:49,283 --> 00:37:51,887
"for Apple to win,
Microsoft has to lose,"

763
00:37:51,889 --> 00:37:55,882
and it was clear that you
didn't have to play that game

764
00:37:55,884 --> 00:37:57,592
because Apple wasn't
going to beat Microsoft.

765
00:37:57,594 --> 00:37:58,916
Apple didn't have
to beat Microsoft.

766
00:37:58,918 --> 00:38:02,000
Apple had to remember
who Apple was.

767
00:38:02,002 --> 00:38:04,030
It was just crazy what
was happening that time,

768
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:07,959
and Apple as very weak,
and so I called Bill up

769
00:38:07,961 --> 00:38:09,601
and we tried
to patch things up.

770
00:38:09,603 --> 00:38:12,412
I think he learned to be
a better businessman.

771
00:38:12,414 --> 00:38:14,973
I think he learned
a little more humility.

772
00:38:14,975 --> 00:38:17,008
Steve really changed
in a number of ways,

773
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:21,812
and he changed primarily
because of failure.

774
00:38:21,814 --> 00:38:24,279
Failure affected him,
and he learned from.

775
00:38:24,281 --> 00:38:29,118
Jobs created a brand-new
product at Apple, the iMac.

776
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,825
I think there was
a decision to look different.

777
00:38:31,827 --> 00:38:36,488
Remember, their motto immediately after
his return was "think different,"

778
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:41,065
and he didn't say that
because he didn't believe it.

779
00:38:41,067 --> 00:38:42,562
He really did want
to think different,

780
00:38:42,564 --> 00:38:44,413
and they would have to
appear different

781
00:38:44,415 --> 00:38:47,041
to show that they
were thinking different.

782
00:38:47,043 --> 00:38:49,235
The pair joked about
the relationship

783
00:38:49,237 --> 00:38:56,943
between "Mac Man" Jobs
and "PC Man" Bill Gates.

784
00:38:56,945 --> 00:38:59,888
PC guy is great
but not a big heart.

785
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:04,658
His mother
loves him.

786
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,652
His mother
loves him.

787
00:39:08,193 --> 00:39:11,830
PC guy is what makes it
all work actually.

788
00:39:11,832 --> 00:39:14,559
All right.

789
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:15,901
It's worth
thinking about.

790
00:39:15,903 --> 00:39:19,949
The truth about Bill Gates
is a brilliant man

791
00:39:19,951 --> 00:39:25,915
who you could... and I did talk to
for long periods about the future.

792
00:39:25,917 --> 00:39:28,390
He could think
quite intelligently

793
00:39:28,392 --> 00:39:31,154
about the future,
but the way Microsoft worked

794
00:39:31,156 --> 00:39:35,123
as a business was far more
incremental than Apple.

795
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:38,788
All the while, they were
working on some big leap,

796
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:42,592
and Microsoft tended
to do the incremental stuff

797
00:39:42,594 --> 00:39:43,993
almost all the time.

798
00:39:43,995 --> 00:39:46,692
What's Steve's done
is quite phenomenal.

799
00:39:46,694 --> 00:39:49,738
His ability to
always come around

800
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:52,898
and figure out where
that next bet should be

801
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,300
has been phenomenal.

802
00:39:54,302 --> 00:39:56,668
Apple literally
was failing

803
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,676
when Steve went back
and re-infused

804
00:39:58,678 --> 00:40:03,075
the innovation
and risk-taking

805
00:40:03,077 --> 00:40:04,715
that have been
phenomenal.

806
00:40:04,717 --> 00:40:08,957
So the industry has benefited
immensely from his work.

807
00:40:08,959 --> 00:40:11,965
We've both been lucky
to be part of it,

808
00:40:11,967 --> 00:40:14,990
but I'd say he's contributed
as much as anyone.

809
00:40:14,992 --> 00:40:16,365
I think he built the
first software company

810
00:40:16,367 --> 00:40:19,190
before anybody
really in our industry

811
00:40:19,192 --> 00:40:20,933
knew what
a software company was

812
00:40:20,935 --> 00:40:24,239
except for these guys
and that was huge.

813
00:40:24,241 --> 00:40:26,414
Bill Gates is a brilliant man.

814
00:40:26,416 --> 00:40:29,616
He did a lot
for the world in technology.

815
00:40:29,618 --> 00:40:32,177
And he is now doing a lot
for the world in philanthropy,

816
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:35,121
and I think highly
of Bill Gates,

817
00:40:35,123 --> 00:40:39,785
but...Of the two of them,

818
00:40:39,787 --> 00:40:43,257
the one that took
the bigger risks

819
00:40:43,259 --> 00:40:46,368
and changed the game more often,
it was Steve...

820
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:47,658
It was Steve Jobs.

821
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:50,662
I'd give a lot to have
Steve Jobs' taste.

822
00:40:51,758 --> 00:40:54,637
He has natural...

823
00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:56,260
It's not a joke
at all.

824
00:40:56,262 --> 00:40:57,903
I think in terms
of intuitive taste

825
00:40:57,905 --> 00:41:00,007
both for people
and products,

826
00:41:00,009 --> 00:41:02,877
the way he does things
is just different,

827
00:41:02,879 --> 00:41:05,918
and I think
it's magical.

828
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,949
Despite their rivalry,
in this joint appearance

829
00:41:08,951 --> 00:41:11,449
after Jobs had been
diagnosed with cancer,

830
00:41:11,451 --> 00:41:13,349
they displayed
a healthy respect

831
00:41:13,351 --> 00:41:16,552
and even affection
for one another.

832
00:41:16,554 --> 00:41:18,859
I think of most things
in life as either

833
00:41:18,861 --> 00:41:20,685
a Bob Dylan
or Beatles song,

834
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:24,356
but there's that one line
in that one Beatles song,

835
00:41:24,358 --> 00:41:26,299
"you and I have memories
longer than the road

836
00:41:26,301 --> 00:41:27,758
that stretches out ahead,"

837
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,099
and that's clearly
true here.

838
00:41:31,101 --> 00:41:32,308
That's sweet

839
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:33,876
I think we should
end it there.

840
00:41:33,878 --> 00:41:35,850
It was one of the highlights

841
00:41:35,852 --> 00:41:38,704
of my journalistic career
to be there.

842
00:41:38,706 --> 00:41:39,812
Thank you very much

843
00:41:39,814 --> 00:41:40,978
Thank you
so much.

844
00:41:44,184 --> 00:41:46,315
In fact,
we were quite taken aback

845
00:41:46,317 --> 00:41:49,518
by the standing ovation
and seeing some of the people

846
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,952
from where we were sitting
onstage actually shedding tears.

847
00:41:52,954 --> 00:41:56,498
It sounds strange, but it was
actually an emotional thing.

848
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:00,263
So I can move this with just
a touch anywhere I want.

849
00:42:01,935 --> 00:42:05,374
Steve Jobs, now at the peak
of his creative genius,

850
00:42:05,376 --> 00:42:11,074
was leading Apple to the peak
of its creative success.

851
00:42:11,076 --> 00:42:12,777
The key to the success
of the company

852
00:42:12,779 --> 00:42:15,291
was in moving
beyond the computer,

853
00:42:15,293 --> 00:42:18,686
was in seeing how
the microprocessor

854
00:42:18,688 --> 00:42:20,715
was getting so cheap
that it could be applied

855
00:42:20,717 --> 00:42:23,549
to other consumer
electronic devices.

856
00:42:25,962 --> 00:42:27,759
Innovative
new products poured

857
00:42:27,761 --> 00:42:29,492
in a seemingly endless stream

858
00:42:29,494 --> 00:42:32,791
from Apple's
development laboratories,

859
00:42:32,793 --> 00:42:36,567
pouring a stream of cash
into Apple's coffers.

860
00:42:36,569 --> 00:42:40,446
250 million or a billion or
however many iPods are out there

861
00:42:40,448 --> 00:42:44,940
are what built
the Apple of today, not the Mac.

862
00:42:44,942 --> 00:42:46,643
Approaching
the age of 50,

863
00:42:46,645 --> 00:42:48,953
barely a quarter
of a century after making

864
00:42:48,955 --> 00:42:57,154
his first million greenbacks,
Jobs was worth $2.3 billion.

865
00:42:57,156 --> 00:43:01,188
Now he picked up the pace
of Apple's evolution.

866
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:04,894
Computers?
They were yesterday's news.

867
00:43:04,896 --> 00:43:07,993
He was conquering
the world of music.

868
00:43:07,995 --> 00:43:09,697
Great new products.

869
00:43:09,699 --> 00:43:13,534
Jobs was hurting
his competitors.

870
00:43:13,536 --> 00:43:18,316
iTunes pretty well killed off
the music store,

871
00:43:18,318 --> 00:43:21,317
and virgin mega-stores,
you know, have slowly

872
00:43:21,319 --> 00:43:26,116
been disappearing
around the world.

873
00:43:26,118 --> 00:43:28,449
Half a million songs
are downloaded

874
00:43:28,451 --> 00:43:31,817
on iTunes every day,

875
00:43:31,819 --> 00:43:37,558
in many cases
changing artists' lives.

876
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:40,392
Hip-hop group
the black eyed peas were asked

877
00:43:40,394 --> 00:43:43,738
to star
in an iTunes commercial.

878
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:48,375
They later became the most
downloaded band on iTunes,

879
00:43:48,377 --> 00:43:50,876
but at the time,
they didn't understand

880
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:52,913
this new cultural phenomenon.

881
00:43:52,915 --> 00:43:56,019
They said, "hey. They want to
use a black eyed peas song

882
00:43:56,021 --> 00:43:59,214
for an iTunes commercial,"

883
00:43:59,216 --> 00:44:02,314
and I said what's iTunes?"

884
00:44:02,316 --> 00:44:06,168
And they said,
"they're not paying much,

885
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:09,157
but they're going to
give you guys iPods."

886
00:44:09,159 --> 00:44:10,200
"What's an iPod?"

887
00:44:10,202 --> 00:44:15,205
This is the new iPod Nano.

888
00:44:15,207 --> 00:44:17,778
But Jobs' influence
on the music industry

889
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:20,747
went far beyond
simple star making.

890
00:44:20,749 --> 00:44:24,214
Way before iTunes,
Steve Jobs has been

891
00:44:24,216 --> 00:44:27,380
a part of music because
every major studio

892
00:44:27,382 --> 00:44:30,544
has a Mac computer in it.

893
00:44:30,546 --> 00:44:34,450
I mean, the Mac computer is
an artist's computer.

894
00:44:34,452 --> 00:44:36,917
Musicians
are still important,

895
00:44:36,919 --> 00:44:38,884
but people like Steve Jobs
are uber, uberimportant.

896
00:44:38,886 --> 00:44:41,724
They bought CDs,
and they want to buy downloads.

897
00:44:41,726 --> 00:44:44,257
People don't want
to rent their music

898
00:44:44,259 --> 00:44:46,295
Life in Apple's orchard

899
00:44:46,297 --> 00:44:48,327
had never been more fruitful.

900
00:44:50,999 --> 00:44:55,880
Then Steve Jobs
learned he had cancer.

901
00:45:01,418 --> 00:45:04,664
A standing ovation
for Apple ceo Steve Jobs

902
00:45:04,666 --> 00:45:06,487
as he greeted the public
for the first time

903
00:45:06,489 --> 00:45:08,294
in more than a year.

904
00:45:08,296 --> 00:45:12,523
He carried on working,
but the years that followed

905
00:45:12,525 --> 00:45:16,460
were a roller coaster
of hope and despair.

906
00:45:16,462 --> 00:45:18,700
Most poignantly he
was asked

907
00:45:18,702 --> 00:45:22,462
what the next few years
might hold.

908
00:45:22,464 --> 00:45:24,232
The future is long.

909
00:45:24,234 --> 00:45:28,166
Ha ha ha!

910
00:45:28,168 --> 00:45:31,439
The last few years have reminded
me that life is fragile

911
00:45:35,475 --> 00:45:41,512
um, you know...

912
00:45:41,514 --> 00:45:45,392
Finally he
withdrew from public life.

913
00:45:45,394 --> 00:45:48,095
Only his closest friends saw
how he was coping

914
00:45:48,097 --> 00:45:50,994
with the threat
of an early death.

915
00:45:57,363 --> 00:45:59,130
Steve Jobs loved
to take walks.

916
00:45:59,132 --> 00:46:01,304
He did a lot of his thinking
and his talking

917
00:46:01,306 --> 00:46:05,177
with his close friends
like Larry Ellison

918
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:07,414
and a number of other people
that he was friendly with

919
00:46:07,416 --> 00:46:08,948
in silicon valley,
and he would go

920
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:12,913
on these long walks sometimes
around Palo Alto,

921
00:46:12,915 --> 00:46:16,421
where he lived,
and sometimes in other places.

922
00:46:16,423 --> 00:46:19,690
It just was his preferred
method of thinking

923
00:46:19,692 --> 00:46:23,103
and daydreaming ideas
with people.

924
00:46:23,105 --> 00:46:26,761
One day I was out
in silicon valley.

925
00:46:26,763 --> 00:46:30,095
He found out about it,
and he conveyed to me

926
00:46:30,097 --> 00:46:32,403
that he would like me
to come over to his house,

927
00:46:32,405 --> 00:46:36,505
and this was just after
his liver transplant,

928
00:46:36,507 --> 00:46:38,439
which as we all know is
a very serious kind of thing

929
00:46:38,441 --> 00:46:40,073
that takes
a lot of recovery,

930
00:46:40,075 --> 00:46:41,188
and he wanted me to come over

931
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:44,892
and just talk
about industry gossip

932
00:46:44,894 --> 00:46:47,612
in a way or events
that had gone on

933
00:46:47,614 --> 00:46:50,615
since he'd been
kind of out of action.

934
00:46:50,617 --> 00:46:52,087
He was very frail.

935
00:46:52,089 --> 00:46:54,589
We talked about his health,

936
00:46:54,591 --> 00:46:57,562
and he talked about how
he felt he was recovering,

937
00:46:57,564 --> 00:47:01,498
and in the middle of this,
he said, "let's go for a walk,"

938
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:05,130
and I said, "really? Really?
You're sure you want

939
00:47:05,132 --> 00:47:07,164
to go for a walk?"

940
00:47:07,166 --> 00:47:10,067
We're about halfway
to the neighborhood park,

941
00:47:10,069 --> 00:47:11,207
and he stops, you kn..

942
00:47:11,209 --> 00:47:14,173
He wasn't gasping for air
or anything,

943
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:15,873
but he was not
well-looking man,

944
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:21,328
and I said, "Steve, why don't
we go back to the house?"

945
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:24,323
And he smiled or chuckled,
and he said,

946
00:47:24,325 --> 00:47:26,423
"no. We're not going
back to the house.

947
00:47:26,425 --> 00:47:29,035
"I just need a minute and then
we're gonna go on to the park

948
00:47:29,037 --> 00:47:30,594
"because that's my goal.

949
00:47:30,596 --> 00:47:32,735
"I set a goal every day,
and my goal now

950
00:47:32,737 --> 00:47:34,825
is to get to this park."

951
00:47:34,827 --> 00:47:37,263
I said, "you're sure?"
And he said, "yeah."

952
00:47:37,265 --> 00:47:40,800
So we walked to the park,
and, you know, he was fine.

953
00:47:40,802 --> 00:47:42,302
We talked by the way
the whole way.

954
00:47:42,304 --> 00:47:44,270
We were dog
what he does on walks,

955
00:47:44,272 --> 00:47:46,605
which is we were talking
about different things,

956
00:47:46,607 --> 00:47:49,986
and we got to the park,
and we sat on a bench,

957
00:47:49,988 --> 00:47:52,617
and we talked about...
In the park,

958
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:54,518
if I remember correctly,
we actually talked

959
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:57,615
more about life and health
and... you know,

960
00:47:57,617 --> 00:48:00,227
I had had a heart attack
some years before,

961
00:48:00,229 --> 00:48:02,995
and he was lecturing me
about that,

962
00:48:02,997 --> 00:48:05,399
and I was sort of
lecturing him, as well,

963
00:48:05,401 --> 00:48:07,965
about work/life balance
and all these things,

964
00:48:07,967 --> 00:48:09,703
and then we got up
and walked back

965
00:48:09,705 --> 00:48:11,232
and talked some more.

966
00:48:13,738 --> 00:48:18,510
And the last thing
he said to me was

967
00:48:18,512 --> 00:48:19,890
"you know, Walt,
you and I have been

968
00:48:19,892 --> 00:48:24,219
"through lots of adventures
over the last 15 years,

969
00:48:24,221 --> 00:48:28,384
and we're going to have some
more adventures to come."

970
00:48:28,386 --> 00:48:30,223
We never did.

971
00:48:36,321 --> 00:48:43,530
On October 5, 2011,
Steve Jobs died.

972
00:48:43,532 --> 00:48:46,132
The next day, his closest
friend and colleague

973
00:48:46,134 --> 00:48:50,072
Steve Wozniak paid
his own tribute.

974
00:48:50,074 --> 00:48:52,778
I'm going to miss
the chance to go to him

975
00:48:52,780 --> 00:49:00,022
and just sit down and share
just person to person.

976
00:49:00,024 --> 00:49:03,220
How much fun we had... ohh...

977
00:49:03,222 --> 00:49:04,916
How much fun we had
in those days

978
00:49:04,918 --> 00:49:06,991
doing things together.

979
00:49:06,993 --> 00:49:10,098
You lose it,
you can't ever go back

980
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:13,362
and just have those
conversations

981
00:49:13,364 --> 00:49:15,005
that make us both smile.

982
00:49:27,542 --> 00:49:30,762
As the world mourned,
the most fitting tribute

983
00:49:30,764 --> 00:49:33,880
came from one
of Steve Jobs' young fans.

984
00:49:33,882 --> 00:49:37,115
19-year-old Hong Kong-based
design student

985
00:49:37,117 --> 00:49:39,150
Jonathan Mak Long
created an image

986
00:49:39,152 --> 00:49:42,725
on his Mac that went viral
around the world.

987
00:49:45,277 --> 00:49:47,004
There was no real
research behind it.

988
00:49:47,006 --> 00:49:48,995
I just messed around
on my computer,

989
00:49:48,997 --> 00:49:50,895
and it just happened.

990
00:49:50,897 --> 00:49:53,328
It made sense to incorporate
his silhouette,

991
00:49:53,330 --> 00:49:56,133
his profile into the logo.

992
00:49:56,135 --> 00:49:59,940
It's gotten around
200,000 responses on my blog.

993
00:49:59,942 --> 00:50:02,078
Some people have said to me
that the logo actually

994
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,011
made them cry,
and I thought it was

995
00:50:04,013 --> 00:50:05,516
a really strong
reaction to have,

996
00:50:05,518 --> 00:50:07,961
but it made sense
because Steve Jobs

997
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:10,185
had such a great impact
on our world.

998
00:50:13,429 --> 00:50:16,629
He wasn't just this person who
made all these great gadgets.

999
00:50:16,631 --> 00:50:19,777
He actually changed
the that way we communicate.

1000
00:50:23,497 --> 00:50:26,264
When you grow up,
you tend to get told

1001
00:50:26,266 --> 00:50:30,908
that the world is the way it is
and your life

1002
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:33,073
is just to live
your life inside the world,

1003
00:50:33,075 --> 00:50:35,941
try not to bash into
the walls too much,

1004
00:50:35,943 --> 00:50:38,783
try to have a nice
family life, have fun,

1005
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:42,285
save a little money.

1006
00:50:42,287 --> 00:50:45,994
How amazing is it that we live
in an era where his legacy

1007
00:50:45,996 --> 00:50:51,005
will transform people's lives
and experiences of technology

1008
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:53,139
for the foreseeable future?

1009
00:50:53,141 --> 00:50:57,528
This single individual
gave us the original Apple,

1010
00:50:57,530 --> 00:50:59,643
the macintosh, and Pixar

1011
00:50:59,645 --> 00:51:03,673
and the iPod
and the iPhone, iPad.

1012
00:51:03,675 --> 00:51:09,380
That is astonishing.

1013
00:51:09,382 --> 00:51:13,630
Steve Jobs created the most
respected brand in the world

1014
00:51:13,632 --> 00:51:17,285
and shook up
a whole industry,

1015
00:51:17,287 --> 00:51:22,434
and he did it with a lot
of panache and style,

1016
00:51:22,436 --> 00:51:28,328
and, you know, great respect
for him for it.

1017
00:51:28,330 --> 00:51:29,632
Life can be much broader

1018
00:51:29,634 --> 00:51:32,038
once you discover
one simple fact,

1019
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:35,177
and that is everything
around you that you call life

1020
00:51:35,179 --> 00:51:39,473
was made up by people that
were no smarter than you.

1021
00:51:39,475 --> 00:51:42,178
The facts are
the story of his life,

1022
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:43,360
the story of his successes,
the story of his achievements,

1023
00:51:43,362 --> 00:51:47,056
the stories
of the great things he did

1024
00:51:47,058 --> 00:51:51,570
for other people
continue to go on because

1025
00:51:51,572 --> 00:51:53,323
that's good
for our country,

1026
00:51:53,325 --> 00:51:55,831
it's good for the nation,
it's good for the world,

1027
00:51:55,833 --> 00:51:58,193
and it's also good
for the people.

1028
00:51:58,195 --> 00:51:59,660
Of course, that's
what it's all about.

1029
00:51:59,662 --> 00:52:02,336
I think the world
will miss Steve Jobs.

1030
00:52:02,338 --> 00:52:04,294
He took stuff
to a new place,

1031
00:52:04,296 --> 00:52:05,700
and I do identify with that.

1032
00:52:05,702 --> 00:52:06,830
It's exciting when you do that,

1033
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:08,478
so I do find
the excitement of that,

1034
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:10,670
and he also made things
that were beautiful,

1035
00:52:10,672 --> 00:52:13,308
great to touch, great to hold,
good to look at,

1036
00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:14,472
and different colors.

1037
00:52:14,474 --> 00:52:17,014
The minute you understand
that you can poke life

1038
00:52:17,016 --> 00:52:18,512
and actually something will...

1039
00:52:18,514 --> 00:52:20,077
You know, if you push in,
something will pop out

1040
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:22,720
the other side,
you can you can change it,

1041
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:24,314
you can mold it,

1042
00:52:24,316 --> 00:52:27,996
um, that's the most
important thing.

1043
00:52:34,096 --> 00:52:37,678
There's one thing
on which everyone agrees...

1044
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:42,454
Steve Jobs left a legacy
that has changed the world.

1045
00:52:42,456 --> 00:52:45,200
He had the ability
to think up new ways

1046
00:52:45,202 --> 00:52:47,727
of doing things,
not just improve what we have,

1047
00:52:47,729 --> 00:52:49,021
do a better version
of something,

1048
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:51,128
but do it in a totally
different way

1049
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:53,520
that the world would
swing towards.

1050
00:52:59,538 --> 00:53:03,414
And so we fall in love
with Steve because he gave us

1051
00:53:03,416 --> 00:53:09,363
these toys that were not only
fun but really useful. Wow!

1052
00:53:13,834 --> 00:53:17,011
It's upended industry
after industry,

1053
00:53:17,013 --> 00:53:21,974
it's forced everyone
else to follow in his path,

1054
00:53:21,976 --> 00:53:25,411
and it has touched
billions of people.

1055
00:53:25,413 --> 00:53:28,995
He will be regarded
as the person who unlocked

1056
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:32,559
the creativity
of a whole generation.

1057
00:53:32,561 --> 00:53:38,399
He's changed the way we look
at computers, phones,

1058
00:53:38,401 --> 00:53:40,034
how we share, interact.

1059
00:53:40,036 --> 00:53:43,206
He's going to inspire
a whole new generation.

1060
00:53:43,208 --> 00:53:47,771
A 5-year-old 20 years from now
is going to create and design

1061
00:53:47,773 --> 00:53:51,948
and invent and define a world
totally different

1062
00:53:51,950 --> 00:53:54,081
than the way we see it now,

1063
00:53:54,083 --> 00:53:57,154
and it's going to be
because of Steve Jobs.

1064
00:53:57,156 --> 00:53:59,201
Even then he had
this ability to bridge

1065
00:53:59,203 --> 00:54:02,380
a very intellectual world
of high technology

1066
00:54:02,382 --> 00:54:06,519
with something
that everyone could relate to.

1067
00:54:15,842 --> 00:54:19,704
Here's a guy who revolutionized
the computer industry,

1068
00:54:19,706 --> 00:54:25,141
the music industry,
the motion picture industry,

1069
00:54:25,143 --> 00:54:28,943
the telephone industry...
There's 4...

1070
00:54:28,945 --> 00:54:30,715
And maybe more,
I don't know,

1071
00:54:30,717 --> 00:54:33,147
but certainly those 4,

1072
00:54:33,149 --> 00:54:38,057
and if you compare him
with Edison,

1073
00:54:38,059 --> 00:54:41,490
well, there was
the electric power industry,

1074
00:54:41,492 --> 00:54:44,861
the motion picture industry,
and the music industry.

1075
00:54:44,863 --> 00:54:49,166
Edison only had 3.

1076
00:54:49,168 --> 00:54:51,499
That's impact.

1077
00:54:57,416 --> 00:54:59,985
