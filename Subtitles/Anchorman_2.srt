1
00:00:52,929 --> 00:00:54,764
<i>There are many places we could begin</i>

2
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:57,767
<i>the next chapter of
the legend of Ron Burgundy.</i>

3
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,477
<i>This is one such place.</i>

4
00:01:05,108 --> 00:01:07,610
<i>However, we won't begin our tale here.</i>

5
00:01:07,694 --> 00:01:11,781
<i>No, our story begins in
a place all newsmen dream of.</i>

6
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:13,491
<i>In New York City.</i>

7
00:01:33,344 --> 00:01:34,846
Ron Burgundy!

8
00:01:35,513 --> 00:01:38,683
That lady's got an ass
like the Loch Ness Monster.

9
00:01:39,017 --> 00:01:42,020
Thing is mysterious
and ever sought after.

10
00:01:42,353 --> 00:01:44,439
Ron, aren't you going to
say something to him?

11
00:01:44,522 --> 00:01:46,482
Hey, when you've got
an ass like the North Star,

12
00:01:46,566 --> 00:01:48,359
wise men are going to want to follow it.

13
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:51,988
<i>It was a time
before cell phones and steroids.</i>

14
00:01:52,071 --> 00:01:56,743
<i>And for Ron and his now-wife Veronica,
life was good.</i>

15
00:01:56,826 --> 00:02:00,455
The Tooth Fairy's exposed breast
made the child uncomfortable.

16
00:02:00,538 --> 00:02:04,751
The bishop wore
buttless chaps to the bat mitzvah.

17
00:02:04,834 --> 00:02:06,711
Bat mitzvah.

18
00:02:07,295 --> 00:02:11,549
André the Giant
gave a surprisingly nimble foot rub.

19
00:02:11,716 --> 00:02:12,717
Foot rub.

20
00:02:15,345 --> 00:02:16,846
Corningstone. Corningstone.

21
00:02:18,556 --> 00:02:21,184
Oh, no! Oh, no!

22
00:02:21,267 --> 00:02:23,186
They're coming in
through the back door!

23
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:24,312
Oh, no!

24
00:02:25,355 --> 00:02:26,564
Oh, no!

25
00:02:27,398 --> 00:02:29,233
Grab the children! Save the children!

26
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:30,777
Five, four...

27
00:02:31,277 --> 00:02:33,613
- Have a great broadcast.
- You, too, darling.

28
00:02:36,074 --> 00:02:37,116
Good evening.

29
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,328
<i>This is the weekend edition of
WBC News at 6:30.</i>

30
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:41,788
I'm Ron Burgundy.

31
00:02:41,871 --> 00:02:43,414
And I'm Veronica Corningstone.

32
00:02:43,581 --> 00:02:45,083
Our top story tonight.

33
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:46,668
The U.N. today announced
sanctions against...

34
00:02:46,751 --> 00:02:50,755
When the broadcast is over,
send these two up to my office.

35
00:02:51,214 --> 00:02:53,132
Time to make a change.

36
00:02:57,095 --> 00:03:01,641
Rumor has it that
after 35 years of manning the helm,

37
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:04,852
Mack Tannen
is thinking about stepping down.

38
00:03:04,936 --> 00:03:05,937
That's right.

39
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:12,527
Do you think we could be getting
the <i>Nightly News,</i> Ron?

40
00:03:13,236 --> 00:03:14,779
I think that's exactly
what's about to happen.

41
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:16,698
Oh, my God.
That's what's happening, isn't it?

42
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:18,783
- I'm hyperventilating.
- Yes, I see that.

43
00:03:20,785 --> 00:03:22,203
Look at me.

44
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:24,622
You... Well.

45
00:03:24,706 --> 00:03:26,666
I'm laughing like
a ventriloquist's dummy.

46
00:03:26,749 --> 00:03:28,292
You are.

47
00:03:28,376 --> 00:03:30,211
Let's stop that before we get in there.

48
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:31,754
Don't do that in there, darling.

49
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,466
Mr. Tannen, you are an inspiration, sir.

50
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:40,555
I've been doing the evening news now
for over 35 years.

51
00:03:40,847 --> 00:03:42,849
- Done a hell of a job.
- Yes, sir.

52
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:44,183
A hell of a job!

53
00:03:44,267 --> 00:03:45,852
I've gone through four wives.

54
00:03:45,935 --> 00:03:49,689
I have six or seven kids that
I haven't got the time to tell I love them.

55
00:03:49,814 --> 00:03:52,191
To be honest, they sound a little needy.

56
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:55,653
And I killed four men in Okinawa.

57
00:03:56,362 --> 00:03:57,822
W.W. TWO.

58
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,867
And that was two weeks ago.

59
00:04:02,452 --> 00:04:06,581
The point is,
this is a very demanding job.

60
00:04:06,664 --> 00:04:07,874
Yes.

61
00:04:07,957 --> 00:04:12,837
But I'm close to thinking that
you may have what it takes.

62
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:16,257
Now, let me look at you.

63
00:04:19,302 --> 00:04:20,553
Oh, my God.

64
00:04:21,846 --> 00:04:23,723
Would it be wrong
to say you smell terrific?

65
00:04:23,806 --> 00:04:25,516
- Ron, please!
- Okay.

66
00:04:26,017 --> 00:04:27,602
What are you?

67
00:04:28,686 --> 00:04:29,771
Finnish?

68
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:35,151
Oddly enough,
I'm 100% full-blown Mexican.

69
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:37,612
From the state of Oaxaca.

70
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:40,031
No, you're not, honey.

71
00:04:40,782 --> 00:04:42,450
Hello, sir.

72
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:44,535
My heart is racing.

73
00:04:47,789 --> 00:04:51,793
I just have to say,
this is super creepy and unorthodox.

74
00:04:54,462 --> 00:04:56,672
You like-a da merchandise, huh?

75
00:04:58,883 --> 00:05:00,051
Sorry.

76
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:03,179
All right.

77
00:05:06,015 --> 00:05:10,478
We're about to make
network news history.

78
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:12,396
- Veronica.
- Yes?

79
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:18,361
You're going to be the first
female full-time network news anchor.

80
00:05:18,486 --> 00:05:21,113
- Oh, my goodness!
- I knew it.

81
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,698
And you, Mr. Burgundy...

82
00:05:22,907 --> 00:05:25,451
I'm going to be
the first lactose intolerant anchor.

83
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:27,745
- Mr. Burgundy.
- Yes?

84
00:05:27,912 --> 00:05:29,372
You're fired.

85
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,040
Come again?

86
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,583
Fired.

87
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,754
You are the worst anchorman

88
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:39,257
I have ever seen.

89
00:05:39,924 --> 00:05:42,468
But what did I do wrong?
Name one thing.

90
00:05:42,927 --> 00:05:46,681
Korean soldiers
were fired upon in the DMZ!

91
00:05:47,473 --> 00:05:49,016
Jeez, I am so sorry.

92
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,602
Someone put the story
in all capital letters,

93
00:05:51,686 --> 00:05:53,813
and I thought I was supposed to yell it.

94
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:57,441
President Parter... Shit!

95
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:01,696
I mean, President Carter
will speak at the summit Tuesday.

96
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,698
Tony, did I just curse?

97
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:05,867
Are you kidding me? Shit!

98
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,744
I mean... Shit. Shoot!

99
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,415
The slain Civil Rights leader
was eulogized...

100
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:16,919
Did you see that? Right on the lens!

101
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,548
Now, I know this is tricky,
given your relationship,

102
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:23,175
so I'm going to
give you the evening to think about it.

103
00:06:23,301 --> 00:06:24,594
I forbid it!

104
00:06:24,677 --> 00:06:28,556
You forbid it?
What? Who are you? Julius Caesar?

105
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,516
Who the hell is Julius Caesar?

106
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,602
You know I don't follow the NBA.

107
00:06:32,685 --> 00:06:34,896
Look, I am so sorry
that this happened, Ron,

108
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:37,440
but you and I,
we're partners, sweetheart.

109
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:41,444
And when something good
happens to me, it also happens to you.

110
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:42,945
That's ridiculous!

111
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:45,031
It clearly just happened to you!

112
00:06:45,114 --> 00:06:46,991
You... Be quiet.

113
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:48,784
Mom?

114
00:06:48,868 --> 00:06:50,578
I'm sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Burgundy.

115
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:51,829
He no go to sleep.

116
00:06:51,913 --> 00:06:53,581
Damn it, Lupita,
what have you been doing up there?

117
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:54,916
Eating nachos?

118
00:06:54,999 --> 00:06:58,294
Mommy? Daddy?
Why are you yelling at each other?

119
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:00,671
Did Mom touch Dad's hair again?

120
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:03,507
Walter, honey,
why don't you just go to bed, all right?

121
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:05,843
Mommy and Daddy
are just having a discussion.

122
00:07:05,927 --> 00:07:07,428
No! He needs to hear this.

123
00:07:08,012 --> 00:07:10,014
He's six years old. He's a man.

124
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:12,016
Walter, listen to me.

125
00:07:12,183 --> 00:07:13,768
Life isn't a fairy tale.

126
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:17,063
It's not a bunch of
jumping rope and grabbing ass.

127
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:18,481
It's complicated.

128
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:19,774
What do you want to do with your life?

129
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:21,150
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

130
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:23,694
I want to be an astronaut or a cowboy!

131
00:07:23,778 --> 00:07:25,947
You're never going to be
any of those, okay?

132
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,073
Ron!

133
00:07:27,156 --> 00:07:29,158
You've got to set the bar a lot lower.

134
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:31,994
Service industry.
Fry cook. Prison guard.

135
00:07:32,078 --> 00:07:34,622
Maybe you're
a lighting guy at a porn shoot.

136
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,710
Which basically means you hold up
a flashlight while adults do things.

137
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,295
He is a child, Ron!

138
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:44,006
Nah,nah,nah!
He's got hair on his nugs.

139
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,675
He's old enough to hear this.

140
00:07:45,758 --> 00:07:47,009
Your father is a wise man.

141
00:07:47,093 --> 00:07:49,261
I will lock you in a closet!

142
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:52,014
Veronica, here's the bottom line.

143
00:07:52,682 --> 00:07:54,809
It's a very simple decision.

144
00:07:56,102 --> 00:07:59,897
It's either me or the job.

145
00:08:00,106 --> 00:08:02,775
It doesn't have to be a choice, Ron.

146
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:04,777
Don't do this.

147
00:08:04,944 --> 00:08:08,906
Don't throw away everything that
we've worked so hard for.

148
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:10,866
Me...

149
00:08:11,951 --> 00:08:13,244
...or the job.

150
00:08:28,676 --> 00:08:32,054
<i>Hello, and welcome to
the 3:10 Dolphin Show at Sea World.</i>

151
00:08:32,138 --> 00:08:34,181
<i>Sponsored by British Petroleum.</i>

152

<i>B.P. Oil, nature's best friend.</i>

<i>And now, here's your host,

<i>Good afternoon, everyone.</i>

155
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,901
<i>And welcome to
world-famous Sea World,</i>

156

<i>here in San Diago, California.</i>

157

<i>Here's a fun fact, dolphins aren't fish.
They're mammals.</i>

158
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,245
<i>Here's another fun fact,</i>

159
00:08:56,662 --> 00:09:02,460
<i>I haven't felt the loving embrace of
a human being in over three months.</i>

160
00:09:06,297 --> 00:09:09,675
<i>I'm so lonely
I paid a hobo to spoon with me.</i>

161
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:14,472
<i>Let's bring out
our world-class trainers here,</i>

162
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:16,140
<i>Jesse and Paula.</i>

163
00:09:17,725 --> 00:09:19,727
<i>Thank you. Thank you, Ron.</i>

164
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:21,979
<i>Sometimes I try to kiss 'em.</i>

165
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,983
<i>Ron Burgundy, everyone.</i>

166
00:09:26,067 --> 00:09:27,151
<i>- I want to kiss you.
-No.</i>

167
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:28,652
<i>- Or I'll kiss your friend.
-No.</i>

168
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:30,613
<i>How about
the two trainers kiss each other?</i>

169
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:32,323
<i>What do you say?</i>

170
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:37,828
<i>So, let's say hello to the stars
of the show, Chippy and Roo-roo!</i>

171
00:09:38,037 --> 00:09:39,371
<i>For your information,</i>

172
00:09:39,455 --> 00:09:42,833
<i>Chippy was rehabilitated
and Roo-roo is an asshole.</i>

173
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:46,879
<i>Look, they're swimming
and doing tricks!</i>

174
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:48,756
<i>Folks, what do you expect?
They're dolphins.</i>

175
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,967
<i>What did you say?</i>

176
00:09:52,051 --> 00:09:53,928
<i>Look at you, with that permanent smile.</i>

177
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:56,138
<i>You think you're so smart,
with your secret language.</i>

178
00:09:56,222 --> 00:09:57,973
<i>You just fart out of the top of your head.</i>

179
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:02,144
You're a punk, Ron Burgundy!

180
00:10:02,645 --> 00:10:05,773
Children and animals hate you,
Ron Burgundy!

181
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:08,609
<i>I would eat dolphins if it was legal!</i>

182
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:11,153
Unhand me, you buffoons!

183
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,699
All right, first,
you threw up in the shark tank.

184
00:10:15,783 --> 00:10:18,119
Then you fed the seals a chicken gyro?

185
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:19,620
And now this?

186
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:21,747
You're fired, you washed-up drunk!

187
00:10:22,081 --> 00:10:23,707
Guess what, Trevor?

188
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,626
Every morning
I get here a half hour early

189
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:28,337
and I sexually assault a starfish!

190
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,758
This is the end of the road.
I'm not turning back.

191
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:36,303
Well, I know it's not a pretty sight.

192
00:10:36,387 --> 00:10:37,847
And you're gonna be the sole witness.

193
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:41,058
If you can't handle it,
you leave the room.

194
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:44,019
It's too late, Baxter.

195
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:47,815
I'm going the way of the ancient samurai

196
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:51,735
who, when dishonored, would hang
themselves from a fluorescent light.

197
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:55,948
Goodbye, my sweet hairy prince.

198
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:03,914
Sweet cream on nipples!

199
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:06,333
Mr. Burgundy? Hello, I...

200
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:09,086
Oh, my God!

201
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,005
What the hell happened?

202
00:11:13,591 --> 00:11:15,551
I tried to hang myself?

203
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:17,303
Because my life's a mess?

204
00:11:17,803 --> 00:11:19,555
And I saw no other option?

205
00:11:19,889 --> 00:11:23,809
I think you're telling the truth, but why
are you saying it like you're lying?

206
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:25,686
It was a call for help?

207
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:29,023
But it didn't work because I'm too heavy
and the ceiling lamp broke?

208
00:11:29,732 --> 00:11:31,358
Something like that?

209
00:11:31,442 --> 00:11:34,236
Yeah, I think you're telling the truth.

210
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,405
I am. That's what happened.

211
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:40,618
These are first-rate flapjacks.

212
00:11:41,035 --> 00:11:45,497
I'm telling you, suicide makes you
hungry, I don't care what anyone says.

213
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:50,252
My name is Freddie Shapp, and I'm
a producer of a new kind of news.

214
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:53,005
We're starting a 24-hour news channel.

215
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,506
First of its kind!

216
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:57,384
GNN. The Global News Network.

217
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:04,016
That is without a doubt
the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

218
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:07,686
You mean news
going 24 hours around the clock?

219
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:10,147
A channel that's never off,
in other words?

220
00:12:10,231 --> 00:12:13,567
Yeah. Yeah. Just 24 hours. It's...

221
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:17,404
No offense,
but you are a stupid asshole.

222
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:21,242
Mr. Burgundy,
I assure you we are 100% for real.

223
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:23,911
We've got state-of-the-art facilities
in Manhattan.

224
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:28,123
And Kench Allenby, multi-millionaire
and owner of Koala Airlines.

225
00:12:28,374 --> 00:12:30,793
So glad he was acquitted of murder.

226
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:32,795
I'm a big Kench Allenby guy.

227
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:35,923
He's funding the whole network.
He believes in it.

228
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:38,008
I don't think you understand, Freddie.

229
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:43,931
My hero, Mack Tannen, told me I was
the worst journalist he'd ever seen.

230
00:12:45,266 --> 00:12:47,226
I'm not good enough.

231
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:48,310
Here.

232
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:50,896
This is your first week's salary.

233
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,693
By the hymen of Olivia Newton-John!

234
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:57,695
What do you say, Ron?

235
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,365
I'll take the job.

236
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:05,160
And I swear I'll be number one again.

237
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:09,707
I'll take back my son,
restore my reputation,

238
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,959
and make everything right
with Veronica.

239
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:13,752
But more importantly,

240
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:18,007
I'm going to do what God
put Ron Burgundy on this Earth to do.

241
00:13:18,424 --> 00:13:21,302
Have salon-quality hair
and read the news.

242
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:25,139
Ron... You've made my day.

243
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:27,516
I've got the best damn
news team in the world.

244
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:30,769
- Your call.
- I just have to find them.

245
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:43,032
San Diago. Looks like
we begin our search right here at home.

246
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:47,161
Last I heard, Champ Kind was fired
for being drunk on the air and saying,

247
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:51,081
"The only Olympic sport Filipinos
are good at is eating cats and dogs."

248
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:56,670
- Who loves chicken? You do!
- We do!

249
00:13:56,754 --> 00:13:59,089
<i>Delicious chicken
Swing on through</i>

250
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:01,342
<i>Meet the crew!</i>

251
00:14:01,425 --> 00:14:05,471
I'm local San Diego legend Champ Kind,
and I believe in two things.

252
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:06,513
Good chicken,

253
00:14:06,597 --> 00:14:10,726
and that the census is a way for
the U.N. to make your children gay.

254
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:12,853
So come on by and grab a wing.

255
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:16,023
<i>'Cause when you do,
you'll say, "Whammy!"</i>

256
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:18,108
<i>No Catholics or Jews admitted.</i>

257
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:19,401
All right, there you go.

258
00:14:19,485 --> 00:14:22,112
One Whammy Special
with Whammy slaw.

259
00:14:22,488 --> 00:14:25,366
There's a used Band-Aid
in my coleslaw.

260
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:27,451
My gosh, let me take care of that.

261
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:30,913
Get out of here before I smash
your head in, you Commie bastard!

262
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:33,624
If you're from the census,
you take me off your list!

263
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,503
You never did have much
of a bedside manner, Champ.

264
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:39,546
Ron? Ron Burgundy?

265
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,799
- Get over here!
- How are you, friend?

266
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:44,218
God, I have longed for you.

267
00:14:44,385 --> 00:14:45,719
It's good to see you, too.

268
00:14:45,803 --> 00:14:47,304
This feels like home.

269
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:49,056
Are you all right?

270
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:51,183
Yeah, I'm fine. Better now.

271
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:54,019
Okay, let's break the huddle here, huh?

272
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:56,438
- Okay. All right.
- All right.

273
00:14:56,522 --> 00:14:58,315
You get back here!

274
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,566
Don't be weird!

275
00:15:00,109 --> 00:15:02,361
So, anyway,
Harken sat me down, he said,

276
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:05,447
"Champ, you're a dangerous alcoholic,
a racist,

277
00:15:05,531 --> 00:15:08,117
"and I don't think
you know a lick about sports."

278
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,870
And I said, "Ed, you dirty Polack,
it's 10:00 in the morning.

279
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:13,247
"Let's go have some drinks

280
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:16,417
"and go to a baseball game where
the Mexicans hit some touchdowns."

281
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,543
Then he fires me!

282
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:21,880
Fortunately, on the way out the door,
I fake a work injury.

283
00:15:21,964 --> 00:15:23,882
With the settlement, I bought this place.

284
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:26,176
Well, I'm glad to see
you landed on your feet, Champ.

285
00:15:27,136 --> 00:15:28,887
Listen, can I ask you a question?

286
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:30,514
Sure. Anything.

287
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:32,433
Is this chicken?

288
00:15:32,516 --> 00:15:34,351
Hell, no.

289
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:38,021
It's really impossible to turn a profit
if you serve real chicken.

290
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:40,232
Yeah. We use mainly bats.

291
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:41,316
- What?
- Yeah.

292
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,485
But the good quality kind.

293
00:15:43,694 --> 00:15:45,612
That's the most horrible thing
I've ever heard.

294
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:46,655
Yeah?

295
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:48,699
You got to do what you got to do, right?

296
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:50,909
So what you got to do
is serve fried bats?

297
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:53,662
Yep. Do you know what they call bats?

298
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:56,123
- Bats.
-"Chicken of the Cave."

299
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:58,167
No one calls them Chicken of the Cave.

300
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,668
Who's "they," by the way?

301
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:04,131
There's a guy I met named Paco,
sells bikers speed at the pier.

302
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:06,842
So that guy calls them
Chicken of the Cave.

303
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:07,926
Yeah.

304
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,303
That's not "they."

305
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:11,638
Why don't you have a bite
and stop judging it?

306
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:13,432
I'm not going to bite into a fried bat.

307
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:14,558
It's delicious.

308
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:16,393
It's all tendon. Look at it.

309
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:20,564
Was that a bat?

310
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:22,733
Chicken of the Cave.

311
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:24,526
What brings you here, Ron?

312
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:28,197
My friend, we've got a job.
In New York City.

313
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,907
Whammy! I'm in!

314
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:31,408
You've got yourself a sportscaster.

315
00:16:31,492 --> 00:16:32,493
Great.

316
00:16:32,576 --> 00:16:33,744
Denny!

317
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:36,497
Lock up!

318
00:16:36,872 --> 00:16:38,457
Any idea where Brian Fantana is?

319
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,000
You haven't heard?

320
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,668
Fantana hit the big time.

321
00:16:42,211 --> 00:16:44,213
Baby.

322
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:48,592
Yeah, that's it, play for me.
Just play around.

323
00:16:48,884 --> 00:16:51,470
Roll around and lift those legs up.

324
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:56,099
Yeah. I like what's happening!

325
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:58,936
That's it. Yeah. Yeah.

326
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:01,563
You little fuzzball, that's...

327
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:05,234
I got it.

328
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:08,779
It's not getting any better than that.

329
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:10,864
- That's brilliant!
- Yeah, yeah.

330
00:17:10,948 --> 00:17:13,242
Hey, Brian,
you have any time for the little people?

331
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:18,956
Well, I'll be a son of a bitch.

332
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:24,795
- Hey, Brian.
- Champ! How you doing?

333
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:25,963
Hey!

334
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:27,464
- This is a...
- Cool it!

335
00:17:27,548 --> 00:17:29,049
I can't believe...

336
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:30,717
It's great to see you!

337
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:33,345
Welcome. Welcome to my doj'.

338
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,305
This place is spectacular!

339
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:36,598
- It's amazing.
- A bit chaotic today.

340
00:17:36,682 --> 00:17:40,185
We got the Cat <i>Fancy</i> cover coming out.
You know how that can be.

341
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:41,937
I've been living in a tent
for the last two years.

342
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,480
Yeah, this is not that.

343
00:17:43,564 --> 00:17:45,065
We got a sauna in the kitchen.

344
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:48,485
A lot of people think that's weird,
but I keep wine in it.

345
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:51,113
I'm not a wine guy,
but I know you got to keep it hot.

346
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:53,115
And check this out.

347
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:54,950
This was fun.

348
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:57,160
We shot this over two weeks in Prague.

349
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:00,038
You know what they call cats?

350
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:02,874
- Chicken of the rail yard.
- No.

351
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,835
- What?
- Don't indulge him.

352
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,545
- Yeah.
- There's a lot of meat.

353
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:08,046
But I love it.

354
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:11,049
And what's so great about it
is it's so damn true.

355
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:12,175
I hate Mondays!

356
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:14,344
I'm not a Monday guy.

357
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:16,179
Ron hates Mondays.

358
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:18,265
Hell, I'm not crazy about them, either.

359
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:20,559
I also don't like Tuesdays,
Wednesdays or Thursdays.

360
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:24,062
So why are you guys here, anyway?

361
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:28,066
Well, Brian, we're getting
the news team back together again.

362
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,109
Really?

363
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:31,403
And, of course,
we want to know if you'll join us.

364
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:32,946
Jeez, I don't know.

365
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,532
I kind of got the world by the tail here.

366
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:37,200
I don't know if I can.

367
00:18:37,284 --> 00:18:38,368
Christ, I get it.

368
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:40,454
I mean, you're the Quincy Jones
of oat photographers.

369
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:41,872
Why would you leave all this?

370
00:18:41,997 --> 00:18:46,251
Hey, Brian, I don't know if you heard,
but New York has all-nude strip clubs.

371
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:51,048
The question still remains...

372
00:18:51,465 --> 00:18:53,008
Where's Brick Tamland?

373
00:18:54,343 --> 00:18:55,927
You guys didn't hear?

374
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:57,471
No, what happened?

375
00:18:57,554 --> 00:18:58,597
Brick's...

376
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,558
Dead.

377
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:12,736
Brick was lost at sea about a year ago.

378
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:15,322
Thought he saw a bird
and he swam out to pet it.

379
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:16,865
He never came back.

380
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,660
We all loved Brick,

381
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:22,245
even though he never had
a phone number,

382
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:25,666
or address or Social Security number.

383
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:29,378
In six years of working at the station,
he never cashed a paycheck.

384
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:30,587
That sweet Brick.

385
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:31,963
He was a sensitive man, though.

386
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:37,219
He told me he wanted to donate
his organs to science before he died,

387
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:39,888
so he could see where they ended up.

388
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:44,226
He'll long be remembered
and he'll be sorely missed.

389
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:50,941
Thank you, Reverend.

390
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:53,443
Come on!

391
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:55,737
- Brick was a great man.
- Really?

392
00:19:55,821 --> 00:19:57,406
And I will miss him so much.

393
00:19:57,489 --> 00:20:00,075
And I will not rest until I find his killer.

394
00:20:00,158 --> 00:20:01,535
- What?
- His killer?

395
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:04,705
It is hard for me
to believe that he is gone.

396
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,832
He's not gone.

397
00:20:07,249 --> 00:20:10,127
I feel that I just saw him yesterday.

398
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,170
You were probably
talking to yourself in a mirror.

399
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:15,424
When I got the news...

400
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:18,719
I didn't even know
how to make sense out of it!

401
00:20:18,844 --> 00:20:20,053
None of us understand!

402
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:22,180
Why? Why?

403
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:24,558
Why did you take him from us?

404
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:27,144
You're clearly standing in front of us,
Brick.

405
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:28,562
God damn you!

406
00:20:28,729 --> 00:20:30,647
- Brick!
- Brick is dead!

407
00:20:30,731 --> 00:20:32,524
- No, Brick's alive.
- Brick is dead!

408
00:20:32,607 --> 00:20:33,942
- Look at him!
- He's not dead.

409
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:35,235
He's not dead, Brick. You're not dead.

410
00:20:35,318 --> 00:20:36,778
- You're Brick!
- Brick, it's you!

411
00:20:36,862 --> 00:20:38,155
He's dead!

412
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:39,239
No!

413
00:20:39,322 --> 00:20:41,575
You are Brick! Touch yourself.

414
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:43,994
- I am Brick?
- Yes!

415
00:20:44,286 --> 00:20:46,288
- I'm alive?
- Yes!

416
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:47,914
Of course.

417
00:20:47,998 --> 00:20:49,416
Of course you are.

418
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:50,751
For heaven's sake.

419
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:53,545
You kind of want to slug him.
You want to slug him.

420
00:20:56,757 --> 00:21:00,469
Do you remember
our Easter trip to San Francisco?

421
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:03,513
We got so drunk,
we put Brick in a refrigerator box

422
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:06,391
and threw him off
the Golden Gate Bridge.

423
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:08,393
I broke my back!

424
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,772
What about the time
that you dared Champ

425
00:21:11,855 --> 00:21:14,149
to drink that beer stein full of Woolite?

426
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:16,610
He drained it faster than you could say,
"No, don't do it.

427
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:18,695
"That's the equivalent of
drinking poison."

428
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:23,867
Oh, Lord, I was in a six-month coma.

429
00:21:24,034 --> 00:21:29,498
And they say from the neurological
damage, there's no way I live past 55!

430
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:33,460
You got three years left, my friend.

431
00:21:33,543 --> 00:21:35,378
You're gonna die!

432
00:21:37,506 --> 00:21:38,799
Hey, hey, remember?

433
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:43,053
I was by myself and I had that dream
about the orange tree.

434
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:46,014
But instead of oranges,
it had babies on it.

435
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:49,267
It was a baby tree!

436
00:21:49,684 --> 00:21:52,229
Brick, how could we remember?
It's your dream.

437
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:55,732
I don't know. It's all the same thing.

438
00:21:57,692 --> 00:21:59,486
It's an interesting dream,

439
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:02,739
but we're telling stories involving
the entire news team from the past.

440
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:05,575
Remember 10 years from now,

441
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:09,079
when we were all in jet packs
flying around the Earth?

442
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:12,999
How can we remember that?
That's 10 years in the future.

443
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:15,502
And you... Did that...

444
00:22:17,254 --> 00:22:19,756
You had a thing with the jet pack.

445
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:22,801
Apparently, in the future
you have a thing with the jet pack.

446
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:24,135
That's awesome.

447
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,848
Ron, I can't...

448
00:22:27,973 --> 00:22:30,308
I can't stop laughing, Ron!

449
00:22:30,642 --> 00:22:32,310
Put a pencil in his mouth.

450
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:33,770
It's okay.

451
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:35,605
There you go.

452
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:37,399
I'm okay now.

453
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:40,694
Man, this just feels right!
The news team is back!

454
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:45,323
Ron, Brian, Brick, me, even Baxter!

455
00:22:47,325 --> 00:22:49,536
That old man is so little and hairy!

456
00:22:50,662 --> 00:22:51,913
Hey, Ron, who's driving?

457
00:22:51,997 --> 00:22:53,999
It's okay, it's on cruise control.

458
00:22:56,334 --> 00:22:58,461
Who wants some chimichangas?

459
00:22:58,753 --> 00:23:02,048
Best thing I ever did was install
this deep fryer in the 'bago.

460
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,885
Ron, why do you have
this bag of bowling balls

461
00:23:04,968 --> 00:23:07,178
and this terrarium filled with scorpions?

462
00:23:07,262 --> 00:23:10,223
- It's a long, crazy story!
- Hey, Ron.

463
00:23:10,307 --> 00:23:12,809
Cruise control just regulates speed,
it doesn't steer.

464
00:23:13,977 --> 00:23:15,395
Come again?

465
00:24:14,663 --> 00:24:17,457
Well, that is gonna
make one hell of a story.

466
00:24:24,965 --> 00:24:27,884
The Big Apple. Ron Burgundy is back.

467
00:24:27,968 --> 00:24:29,970
Why do they call it the Big Apple, Ron?

468
00:24:30,053 --> 00:24:33,056
Because New York has
an apple tree on every street.

469
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:38,770
Here we are. Welcome to GNN.

470
00:24:41,856 --> 00:24:44,484
I don't know, Ron.
You sure about this place?

471
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:46,903
Guys, I know it's a bit of a mess,
but trust me,

472
00:24:46,987 --> 00:24:49,906
everything will be ready
for the launch tomorrow.

473
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:53,910
And we've culled the whole country
for the best newsmen.

474
00:24:53,994 --> 00:24:55,662
There's Curtis Knightfish from Houston.

475
00:24:55,745 --> 00:24:56,997
Curtis Knightfish.

476
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,832
They don't get any better than that.

477
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:02,002
And there's Diane Yahwea
from Carson City.

478
00:25:02,085 --> 00:25:04,587
Diane Yahwea.
You know what they call her, right?

479
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:06,381
"All the Way Yahwea."

480
00:25:06,464 --> 00:25:07,799
She's my aunt.

481
00:25:07,882 --> 00:25:10,010
And the best in the biz.

482
00:25:10,093 --> 00:25:12,595
Jack Lime, out of Chicago.

483
00:25:12,762 --> 00:25:16,766
Rumor is Allenby
is giving him one mil a year.

484
00:25:16,891 --> 00:25:19,060
That's crazy.
Who's worth that kind of money?

485
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:24,024
Oh, my God!
He's absolutely magnificent!

486
00:25:24,482 --> 00:25:27,068
I bet his poop smells like sandalwood.

487
00:25:27,152 --> 00:25:28,778
Can I help you, guy?

488
00:25:28,945 --> 00:25:30,363
What was that?

489
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:31,781
I said, "Can I help you, guy?"

490
00:25:33,283 --> 00:25:34,242
What do you mean?

491
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:36,745
Well, you're staring at me, hotshot.

492
00:25:36,828 --> 00:25:38,621
Do you want my autograph?

493
00:25:40,665 --> 00:25:44,502
No, he was just explaining
who you were and I was looking at you.

494
00:25:44,586 --> 00:25:47,756
And then he said something
and I was still looking at you.

495
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,514
Jack Lime is a great man!

496
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,893
Is that what I sound like when I talk?

497
00:26:04,064 --> 00:26:05,273
Is there a problem?

498
00:26:05,356 --> 00:26:07,317
No, no, no. No problem.

499
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,736
Well, you're making a face
like you got a problem.

500
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:11,738
I'm sorry that I'm making that face.

501
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:14,949
I don't mean to make a face
that seems like I have a problem.

502
00:26:15,033 --> 00:26:16,367
I don't like that face!

503
00:26:16,451 --> 00:26:18,161
You need to change it,
and change it quick.

504
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:19,579
Stop making that face.

505
00:26:19,662 --> 00:26:21,456
Is this face better?

506
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:22,582
I don't like...

507
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:25,877
That new face is driving me crazy!
Change it, now!

508
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,253
You're getting him mad.

509
00:26:27,337 --> 00:26:29,339
I only have so many faces.

510
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:32,884
I'm just grinding your gears, man.

511
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:34,761
Welcome to the station!

512
00:26:34,844 --> 00:26:37,472
We're going to have
a good time together.

513
00:26:38,181 --> 00:26:42,268
Oh, my God. That's vintage Jack Lime.

514
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:43,520
Come on, guys.

515
00:26:43,603 --> 00:26:44,854
Let's go meet the boss.

516
00:26:45,188 --> 00:26:49,943
We'll have separate cameras for you,
and then sports and then weather.

517
00:26:50,193 --> 00:26:52,445
Let me ask you this, Freddie,
how's the new head honcho?

518
00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:56,074
Well, Linda Jackson
has a shelf full of Emmys.

519
00:26:56,533 --> 00:27:00,662
She's as tough as nails.
And Linda loves to win.

520
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,705
Hey, Linda!

521
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:05,583
I want to introduce you to Ron Burgundy.

522
00:27:05,917 --> 00:27:08,920
Linda Jackson. How are you, my friend?

523
00:27:09,003 --> 00:27:10,004
Ron.

524
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:12,423
This is Linda Jackson.

525
00:27:13,049 --> 00:27:14,425
Hello, Mr. Burgundy.

526
00:27:17,762 --> 00:27:18,888
Black.

527
00:27:20,223 --> 00:27:22,183
- Black.
- Jesus, just stop, Ron.

528
00:27:22,934 --> 00:27:26,729
I'm terribly sorry.
I don't know why I can't stop saying...

529
00:27:27,272 --> 00:27:29,149
Black. The word "black."

530
00:27:29,232 --> 00:27:30,817
Hello, Mr. Burgundy.

531
00:27:30,942 --> 00:27:32,819
- Black.
- Stop.

532
00:27:32,902 --> 00:27:34,028
Black.

533
00:27:34,112 --> 00:27:35,280
Stop saying "black."

534
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:42,787
- Black. If I don't say it, I'll pass out.
- Stop saying it!

535
00:27:42,912 --> 00:27:44,956
Donna, can you please
get me a cup of coffee?

536
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,083
- Right away, Ms. Jackson.
- Thank you.

537
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:49,377
- Please be seated. Everyone.
- Sure.

538
00:27:49,586 --> 00:27:50,920
Please be seated.

539
00:27:53,381 --> 00:27:57,302
Great. So I know that all of you
are aware that the news community

540
00:27:57,385 --> 00:28:00,013
is laughing at what we're trying to do
here at 24-hour news.

541
00:28:00,096 --> 00:28:01,681
But that is why they brought me in.

542
00:28:01,764 --> 00:28:02,891
She's the best!

543
00:28:02,974 --> 00:28:05,226
You see, gentlemen, I don't lose.

544
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:07,353
Listen, I feel like I need to clear the air.

545
00:28:07,437 --> 00:28:08,771
Please don't.

546
00:28:08,855 --> 00:28:10,773
I want to say,
on behalf of the entire news team,

547
00:28:10,857 --> 00:28:15,695
we are huge supporters
of all African and Americans.

548
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:17,655
Veronica got so tan!

549
00:28:17,864 --> 00:28:20,992
I remember the first
African and American I ever saw.

550
00:28:21,075 --> 00:28:22,869
It's African-American.

551
00:28:22,952 --> 00:28:24,621
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

552
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:27,207
Absolutely 100% positive? It isn't like...

553
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:28,458
Ron...

554
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:30,001
Fish and chips?

555
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:34,214
Hey, we're all the same on the inside,
stinky and pink.

556
00:28:34,297 --> 00:28:35,298
When I was in high school,

557
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:37,383
me and my buddies
used to sneak in the girls' locker room.

558
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:38,885
We'd peek at the girls in the shower,

559
00:28:38,968 --> 00:28:42,555
and I'd look at all of them,
no matter what color they were.

560
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:43,681
So...

561
00:28:43,806 --> 00:28:46,809
Jesus, this is the worst meeting
I've ever been in.

562
00:28:46,893 --> 00:28:49,354
A black man follows me everywhere
when it's sunny.

563
00:28:49,437 --> 00:28:51,606
Actually,
I think that's your shadow, Brick.

564
00:28:51,689 --> 00:28:53,066
I call him Leon.

565
00:28:53,149 --> 00:28:55,318
And if it's a cloudy day,
what happens to Leon?

566
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:56,402
He goes home.

567
00:28:56,486 --> 00:28:57,445
It's your shadow.

568
00:28:57,528 --> 00:28:58,571
He's talking about his shadow.

569
00:28:58,655 --> 00:29:01,199
Shut your damn mouths! Sit down!

570
00:29:03,826 --> 00:29:04,827
What's he doing?

571
00:29:04,911 --> 00:29:07,705
I think you scared him.
You can't shout at Brick.

572
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:09,374
Is he all right?

573
00:29:09,707 --> 00:29:12,210
Can you sing him
a soothing siren song?

574
00:29:12,293 --> 00:29:13,586
Just a high melodic...

575
00:29:16,464 --> 00:29:17,882
I'm not singing along with you.

576
00:29:18,925 --> 00:29:20,927
Come on, Brick. Brick!

577
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:22,762
Linda has a balloon.

578
00:29:26,182 --> 00:29:27,767
You better get him a balloon.

579
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:28,977
Is this for real, Freddie?

580
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,520
Linda, I'm sorry.

581
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:32,272
No, it's okay! It's okay.

582
00:29:32,355 --> 00:29:34,565
So you have a black boss,
and it's freaking you out.

583
00:29:34,649 --> 00:29:35,775
Is it freaking you out?

584
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:37,860
- A little bit, to be honest.
- You freaked out?

585
00:29:37,944 --> 00:29:39,862
- Is it freaking you out?
- She's got a knife!

586
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,990
I don't give a shit!

587
00:29:42,073 --> 00:29:44,200
We're not all here
to hold hands and sing Kumbaya.

588
00:29:44,742 --> 00:29:45,994
Black.

589
00:29:46,202 --> 00:29:50,290
So as long as you guys get numbers,
we are gonna get along just fine.

590
00:29:50,581 --> 00:29:53,835
Now, if you don't, I am gonna be icy.

591
00:29:53,918 --> 00:29:55,295
And unpleasant, you dig?

592
00:29:55,378 --> 00:29:58,089
I dig. We all dig.

593
00:29:58,298 --> 00:29:59,465
I like to dig.

594
00:29:59,549 --> 00:30:03,344
One time I went digging for treasure
and I found a half a body.

595
00:30:03,428 --> 00:30:05,221
Get out of my office!

596
00:30:05,305 --> 00:30:09,434
I'm telling you, you can't give an inch
in those situations,

597
00:30:09,517 --> 00:30:11,394
and I think
we held our ground pretty firmly.

598
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:12,645
Guys.

599
00:30:12,729 --> 00:30:16,024
Guys, we got you an apartment
on the Upper East Side

600
00:30:16,107 --> 00:30:17,692
and a whole new wardrobe.

601
00:30:17,775 --> 00:30:20,820
That's wonderful!
When do we begin our broadcast?

602
00:30:20,903 --> 00:30:22,322
Well, the big launch is tomorrow

603
00:30:22,405 --> 00:30:23,990
-at 12:00 noon.
- Okay.

604
00:30:24,073 --> 00:30:27,994
You guys are slotted
for the 2:00 a.m. to 5:00 a.m. slot.

605
00:30:28,328 --> 00:30:31,539
What? That's the graveyard shift!

606
00:30:31,873 --> 00:30:33,541
"I ain't afraid of no ghost."

607
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:35,793
Come on, it's going to be great.

608
00:30:35,877 --> 00:30:37,920
Let's get your keys. Come on!

609
00:30:40,131 --> 00:30:41,174
Is there booze in the apartment?

610
00:30:41,257 --> 00:30:43,134
Of course there's gonna be booze.
Of course.

611
00:31:05,365 --> 00:31:06,699
It won't stop.

612
00:31:07,033 --> 00:31:10,286
Sometimes it stops,
but then it starts again.

613
00:31:12,246 --> 00:31:15,249
What are you doing, Chani? Answer it!

614
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:18,503
Hi. Yes, let me transfer you.

615
00:31:19,253 --> 00:31:21,130
Your job is to answer the phones.

616
00:31:21,631 --> 00:31:24,050
I'm getting ready for Secret Santa.
When is that again?

617
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:27,178
It's at Christmastime.
When else would it be?

618
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,809
I'm Brick. I was dead last week.

619
00:31:33,267 --> 00:31:34,560
I'm Chani.

620
00:31:34,977 --> 00:31:37,980
I like the place between
your head and your body.

621
00:31:38,272 --> 00:31:39,941
I like your hair.

622
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:43,027
It looks like wet popcorn.

623
00:31:43,653 --> 00:31:45,113
Thank you.

624
00:31:45,196 --> 00:31:47,865
Would you like to see the smile that
I use when I pose for photographs?

625
00:31:47,949 --> 00:31:49,117
Yes, please.

626
00:31:50,451 --> 00:31:53,913
Do you want to see the face I make
when I see a snake made out of candy?

627
00:31:54,205 --> 00:31:55,206
Yes.

628
00:31:58,418 --> 00:31:59,502
That's good.

629
00:32:00,294 --> 00:32:02,088
What's your favorite time of day?

630
00:32:02,338 --> 00:32:03,339
Now.

631
00:32:04,632 --> 00:32:06,259
What's your favorite time of day?

632
00:32:06,509 --> 00:32:07,969
A minute ago.

633
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:49,677
Surprise! Big daddy's back.

634
00:32:49,802 --> 00:32:50,928
Ron.

635
00:32:52,555 --> 00:32:54,015
What are you doing here?

636
00:32:54,098 --> 00:32:56,851
I'm over at GNN.
I'm living in the city again.

637
00:32:57,351 --> 00:32:59,604
I really wish that
you would have called first.

638
00:32:59,687 --> 00:33:02,315
Look, it doesn't matter
whose fault the break-up was, okay?

639
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:03,858
I was stubborn.

640
00:33:03,941 --> 00:33:08,571
You were like a mentally ill whore
having PMS from the 1800s.

641
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:10,406
What's your point, Ron?

642
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:14,494
The point is I'm back home.

643
00:33:14,744 --> 00:33:17,038
And I want to spend the rest of my life...

644
00:33:17,121 --> 00:33:18,664
Honey, who is it?

645
00:33:24,378 --> 00:33:27,048
Hi, Ron. I'm Gary, Veronica's lover.

646
00:33:35,598 --> 00:33:38,518
So, is that a gift for me, Ron?

647
00:33:38,768 --> 00:33:40,770
No, it's not.

648
00:33:42,104 --> 00:33:43,105
It's for Walter.

649
00:33:43,314 --> 00:33:44,357
Okay.

650
00:33:44,607 --> 00:33:46,734
So when were you going to
tell me about Gary?

651
00:33:46,817 --> 00:33:48,653
Ron. You walked out on me.

652
00:33:48,736 --> 00:33:51,531
What did you expect me to do?

653
00:33:51,906 --> 00:33:54,909
Ron. This is awkward, I know.

654
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:58,329
I'm sitting here with your wife.
We make love.

655
00:33:58,704 --> 00:34:01,791
I'm this close to shooting
a flare gun at your dick.

656
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:03,000
Ron!

657
00:34:03,292 --> 00:34:05,378
So what does this Gary do for a living?

658
00:34:05,461 --> 00:34:06,879
Have you done
a background check on him?

659
00:34:06,963 --> 00:34:08,381
Gary is actually

660
00:34:08,464 --> 00:34:11,884
one of the most successful
psychologists in all of Manhattan, Ron.

661
00:34:11,968 --> 00:34:13,010
Really sweet.

662
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:14,971
Are you reading my mind right now?

663
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:18,057
Ron, do you even know
what a psychologist is?

664
00:34:19,183 --> 00:34:20,643
Fuck you.

665
00:34:21,602 --> 00:34:22,645
Ron!

666
00:34:22,812 --> 00:34:24,230
- It's okay.
- You stop that!

667
00:34:24,313 --> 00:34:25,648
He's externalizing. That's okay.

668
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:27,775
- No, it's not okay.
- He's mad.

669
00:34:27,858 --> 00:34:31,737
You knew I was going to throw that
punch 'cause you're reading my mind!

670
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:34,657
Mom! I'm home!

671
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,117
- Hey, little guy.
- Hey, darling.

672
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,994
- Hi, Walter.
- Hey, Dad.

673
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:40,162
I missed you!

674
00:34:40,538 --> 00:34:42,832
Walter, your father has a gift for you.

675
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,460
I have a gift specifically for you, Walter.

676
00:34:47,461 --> 00:34:48,588
There you go.

677
00:34:48,671 --> 00:34:49,880
Yes, Gary.

678
00:34:55,011 --> 00:34:56,929
Okay, that's actually for me, Walter.

679
00:34:57,013 --> 00:34:59,223
No, it's not. It's for Walter.

680
00:34:59,307 --> 00:35:00,683
It's a superhero costume.

681
00:35:00,975 --> 00:35:02,184
What is it?

682
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,104
It's "Lace Man."
It's a brand new superhero.

683
00:35:05,271 --> 00:35:07,523
I'm going to be Lace Man!

684
00:35:07,607 --> 00:35:09,358
Look, Ron. Joint custody isn't easy.

685
00:35:09,442 --> 00:35:13,696
But what we need to do is rally around
this little guy right now, okay?

686
00:35:13,821 --> 00:35:15,197
That's never gonna happen.

687
00:35:15,281 --> 00:35:16,699
Excuse me?

688
00:35:16,782 --> 00:35:19,076
Because you, Veronica,
are unfit to be a mother!

689
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:22,705
Need I remind you
that you took that child to a cock fight?

690
00:35:22,872 --> 00:35:24,624
- The game of champions!
- I'm Lace Man!

691
00:35:24,707 --> 00:35:26,167
He had the time of his life!

692
00:35:26,334 --> 00:35:28,169
He came home splattered in blood!

693
00:35:28,252 --> 00:35:31,130
He picked eight winning cocks.
It's never been done!

694
00:35:31,213 --> 00:35:32,923
You have never tried
to connect with Walter.

695
00:35:34,592 --> 00:35:36,844
All right, let's keep it civil
in front of the boy.

696
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:40,431
It's bad enough his mother
is a regular bus stop tramp.

697
00:35:40,514 --> 00:35:42,600
- Okay, you know what, out!
- All right. Get your things! Let's go.

698
00:35:42,683 --> 00:35:43,643
Fine. I'm out of here.

699
00:35:43,726 --> 00:35:45,519
- Don't have to tell me twice.
- Get your things.

700
00:35:45,603 --> 00:35:48,147
- We'll see you guys later.
- Yes, you will.

701
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:50,941
Goodbye, Dad! Thanks for the present.

702
00:35:51,025 --> 00:35:53,736
Goodbye, Walter, my little man.

703
00:35:54,153 --> 00:35:56,322
You promise to do good in school,
okay?

704
00:35:56,405 --> 00:35:57,406
Okay.

705
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:58,699
And stay away from the he-shes...

706
00:35:58,783 --> 00:35:59,867
- Ron!
-...down in the Bowery.

707
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,869
Ron, I don't think that's appropriate.

708
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:03,704
I'll tell you, those fellas,

709
00:36:03,788 --> 00:36:07,500
they got the looks, they got the curves,
they got the chi-chi's,

710
00:36:07,917 --> 00:36:09,835
and then at some point
during the evening,

711
00:36:09,919 --> 00:36:12,838
you reach down below the belt
looking to get a little angel hair pasta,

712
00:36:12,922 --> 00:36:16,050
and you get a handful of
the battle of the bulge.

713
00:36:16,425 --> 00:36:17,760
You hear what I'm saying, Walter?

714
00:36:17,927 --> 00:36:19,136
Yes, I do.

715
00:36:19,345 --> 00:36:22,973
Ron, it was nice meeting you.
I think it's time for you to go.

716
00:36:23,641 --> 00:36:24,934
Ron!

717
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:27,311
You knew!

718
00:36:27,395 --> 00:36:29,271
You anticipated that
because you're reading my mind!

719
00:36:29,355 --> 00:36:30,314
That confirms it!

720
00:36:38,823 --> 00:36:40,366
There's Lime!

721
00:36:40,449 --> 00:36:43,285
Look at him. He's a goddamn prince!

722
00:36:43,828 --> 00:36:46,747
Man, there's just something about him,
you know?

723
00:36:46,831 --> 00:36:48,624
I'd give anything to be friends with him.

724
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:51,335
I don't see what the big deal is,
you know.

725
00:36:51,419 --> 00:36:52,795
He's not that great.

726
00:36:54,797 --> 00:36:56,006
What did you say?

727
00:36:56,799 --> 00:36:58,050
What's that?

728
00:36:58,175 --> 00:36:59,635
I heard you say something.

729
00:37:01,137 --> 00:37:03,556
What did I say? Nothing.

730
00:37:03,723 --> 00:37:05,307
No. I heard you say something.

731
00:37:05,391 --> 00:37:06,726
He said you're not that great!

732
00:37:06,809 --> 00:37:07,810
Brick!

733
00:37:07,977 --> 00:37:09,854
Is that what you said about me?

734
00:37:09,979 --> 00:37:11,522
- He's coming over here.
- I know!

735
00:37:11,647 --> 00:37:13,482
I'm gonna rip this guy in half.

736
00:37:14,275 --> 00:37:16,610
No,no,no!
Just give me a little piece of him.

737
00:37:16,986 --> 00:37:19,029
Jack, look, it's just...

738
00:37:19,113 --> 00:37:22,575
The guys look up to you so much,
and I just was a little jealous.

739
00:37:22,658 --> 00:37:23,993
I just said some junk.

740
00:37:24,952 --> 00:37:26,203
That's funny.

741
00:37:26,287 --> 00:37:31,500
Aren't you the guy
who lost his job to his wife?

742
00:37:34,086 --> 00:37:35,755
Shouldn't you be doing her makeup?

743
00:37:41,093 --> 00:37:43,596
- All right, guys, that's enough.
- No, shut up, Freddie!

744
00:37:44,013 --> 00:37:46,891
And you can shut your mouth,
okay, Jack "Lame"!

745
00:37:50,227 --> 00:37:53,314
- You listen to this one, big fella.
- Yeah.

746
00:37:55,441 --> 00:37:59,028
I bet you that we beat
your ratings tonight.

747
00:38:01,071 --> 00:38:03,282
I'm sorry. I'm trying to keep it together.

748
00:38:03,365 --> 00:38:05,367
No, no, no. Don't do this. Don't do this.

749
00:38:05,451 --> 00:38:08,204
You're on at 2:00 a.m.
Jack has prime time!

750
00:38:08,329 --> 00:38:11,165
Maybe... No. Hey, Freddie, no, no. Hey.

751
00:38:11,916 --> 00:38:14,543
I'll take that bet. What are the stakes?

752
00:38:15,044 --> 00:38:17,880
If we lose, I'll leave New York.

753
00:38:18,881 --> 00:38:20,800
And I'll never read the news again.

754
00:38:21,217 --> 00:38:24,345
And if by some
snowball's chance in hell

755
00:38:24,428 --> 00:38:27,556
Mr. Mustache here
pulls a miracle out of his ass?

756
00:38:29,058 --> 00:38:33,354
You change your name to Jack Lame!
Legally.

757
00:38:33,813 --> 00:38:37,274
I like this! You're on, Stretch.

758
00:38:37,483 --> 00:38:39,026
Everyone heard him?

759
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:40,736
- Freddie, you heard him?
- Yeah. I heard him.

760
00:38:41,278 --> 00:38:43,906
- This is on like <i>Pong.</i>
- Okay. Good.

761
00:38:49,078 --> 00:38:51,330
Why? Why did you make that bet, Ron?

762
00:38:51,413 --> 00:38:53,916
We've got the graveyard shift!
We don't have a chance!

763
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:55,918
Hey, guy!

764
00:38:56,085 --> 00:38:58,212
This ain't local news anymore.

765
00:38:58,295 --> 00:38:59,755
We shit standing up here.

766
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:01,048
What?

767
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,053
It's a huge mess, but damn, is it cool!

768
00:39:06,762 --> 00:39:08,138
All right, everyone!

769
00:39:08,514 --> 00:39:10,391
Ladies and gentlemen,

770
00:39:10,975 --> 00:39:16,522
today wouldn't be possible
without the visionary behind GNN.

771
00:39:17,106 --> 00:39:19,358
Mr. Kench Allenby!

772
00:39:19,441 --> 00:39:21,235
Yeah, yeah!

773
00:39:22,528 --> 00:39:24,071
Thank you.

774
00:39:25,114 --> 00:39:27,116
All right, cheer.

775
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:31,954
I am jabbered,
just jabbered, full of beans, no doubt.

776
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:34,039
Does anyone else speak Australian?

777
00:39:34,123 --> 00:39:35,749
I thought they talked like us.

778
00:39:35,875 --> 00:39:38,878
Can I get you to say with me...

779
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,382
We can't quite understand you.

780
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:46,218
How's this? I'm Kench Allenby.

781
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:48,345
- Yes. That's good.
- There we go! Thank you so much.

782
00:39:48,429 --> 00:39:51,765
I'm Kench Allenby
and you all know my story.

783
00:39:51,849 --> 00:39:52,975
I'm a self-made man.

784
00:39:53,434 --> 00:39:57,771
My late, great father, Vadge Allenby,
gave me $300 million,

785
00:39:57,855 --> 00:40:03,068
and I toiled my whole bloody life
to turn that into $305 million.

786
00:40:03,152 --> 00:40:04,820
True story. True story.

787
00:40:06,906 --> 00:40:09,325
But this is 24-hour news station...

788
00:40:09,408 --> 00:40:10,951
This is history.

789
00:40:11,035 --> 00:40:13,162
This is like Columbus
discovering the New World.

790
00:40:13,245 --> 00:40:18,167
And the captain of this fantastic
voyage is the best newsman in America,

791
00:40:18,459 --> 00:40:19,793
Mr. Jack Lime!

792
00:40:21,045 --> 00:40:23,380
Go get 'em, Jack! Go get 'em!

793
00:40:23,923 --> 00:40:26,467
Thank you.
And good luck to Ron Burgundy, too.

794
00:40:28,469 --> 00:40:30,012
<i>Getting nervous there, com pad re?</i>

795
00:40:31,347 --> 00:40:32,473
Let's do this.

796
00:40:32,681 --> 00:40:34,975
Did you see that?
How he spun on that desk? So great.

797
00:40:35,059 --> 00:40:36,644
All right. Quiet on the floor, please.

798
00:40:37,978 --> 00:40:39,188
All right.

799
00:40:39,271 --> 00:40:41,023
All right. We're up.
Here we go, here we go.

800
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:44,818
In five, four, three, two...

801
00:40:46,487 --> 00:40:49,323
Good day, and welcome to GNN.

802
00:40:49,406 --> 00:40:53,285
Thank you for joining us on what we
believe to be a whole new era of news.

803
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:54,828
I'm Jack Lime,

804
00:40:54,912 --> 00:40:59,291
your guide for this journey of events
we humbly call 24-hour news.

805
00:40:59,375 --> 00:41:01,335
<i>Today's top story, Mount St. Helene.</i>

806
00:41:01,418 --> 00:41:04,463
This is just a gimmick.
It's a flash in the pan.

807
00:41:04,546 --> 00:41:05,881
We better hope so.

808
00:41:06,006 --> 00:41:07,549
<i>Residents are being asked
to evacuate the area...</i>

809
00:41:07,633 --> 00:41:09,259
Twenty-four hours of news.

810
00:41:09,343 --> 00:41:12,096
How are they gonna keep
coming up with this stuff?

811
00:41:12,179 --> 00:41:15,432
My guess is they'll probably be scraping
the bottom of the barrel.

812
00:41:15,516 --> 00:41:18,185
No, I have a feeling
they'll stick with their integrity

813
00:41:18,268 --> 00:41:21,021
and only report
the news that needs to be reported.

814
00:41:21,563 --> 00:41:22,606
Let's see here.

815
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:26,735
"Global temperatures rise half a degree,
alarm climate scientists." Boring.

816
00:41:27,236 --> 00:41:30,030
"China could dominate
the world economy in the next decade."

817
00:41:32,825 --> 00:41:33,867
Nope.

818
00:41:34,243 --> 00:41:35,327
Anyone else?

819
00:41:35,411 --> 00:41:36,954
What if we show a porno
instead of the news?

820
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:38,080
Freddie?

821
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:40,124
No. Absolutely not.

822
00:41:40,207 --> 00:41:41,333
Freddie! Come on!

823
00:41:41,417 --> 00:41:42,876
We're just brainstorming here.

824
00:41:43,085 --> 00:41:45,671
We're trying to figure out how to
make the news less boring,

825
00:41:45,754 --> 00:41:47,923
and you act like
we peed in your milkshake.

826
00:41:48,173 --> 00:41:50,384
The news is supposed to be boring,
Ron!

827
00:41:50,467 --> 00:41:52,052
This is serious stuff.

828
00:41:52,428 --> 00:41:54,722
You're the one that
made this stupid bet!

829
00:41:54,972 --> 00:42:00,144
I just don't know why we have to
tell the people what they need to hear.

830
00:42:00,436 --> 00:42:02,896
Why can't we just
tell them what they want to hear?

831
00:42:03,731 --> 00:42:05,441
Wait, wait, wait.

832
00:42:06,984 --> 00:42:08,235
Say that again.

833
00:42:08,527 --> 00:42:13,782
I said, why do we have to tell the people
what they need to hear?

834
00:42:14,283 --> 00:42:16,452
Why can't we just
tell them what they want to hear?

835
00:42:16,618 --> 00:42:18,495
And what do they want to hear, Ron?

836
00:42:18,746 --> 00:42:21,749
That we live in the greatest country
God ever created.

837
00:42:22,332 --> 00:42:24,793
- Damn straight!
- Made him happy.

838
00:42:25,044 --> 00:42:27,129
And we should do stories on patriots.

839
00:42:27,421 --> 00:42:30,549
Cute, funny little animals, huh? Or diets.

840
00:42:30,632 --> 00:42:33,594
Why blondes have more fun.

841
00:42:33,844 --> 00:42:35,596
And serious investigative pieces,

842
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:38,140
about how much man-fluid
is on hotel duvets.

843
00:42:38,432 --> 00:42:40,601
And only the best sports highlights.

844
00:42:40,684 --> 00:42:44,146
Home runs, slam dunks,
touchdowns and no soccer.

845
00:42:44,313 --> 00:42:45,522
I like the Wind!

846
00:42:45,689 --> 00:42:47,816
Brick's right. People love hurricanes.

847
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:51,236
Tornadoes, earthquakes, floods,
we'll throw Brick right in the middle of it.

848
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,321
You'd do that?

849
00:42:53,238 --> 00:42:54,698
People'll go nuts. I'd watch that!

850
00:42:54,907 --> 00:43:00,662
No, this goes against every rule
of broadcast journalism I know.

851
00:43:00,996 --> 00:43:05,793
Freddie, as the wise man once said,
"so?"

852
00:43:06,418 --> 00:43:08,253
We got 10 hours till we go on.

853
00:43:08,337 --> 00:43:09,463
We'll only need eight!

854
00:43:17,721 --> 00:43:19,473
<i>Lady</i>

855
00:43:20,808 --> 00:43:24,019
<i>I'm your knight in shining armor</i>

856
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,480
<i>And I love you</i>

857
00:43:27,856 --> 00:43:31,860
<i>You have made me what I am</i>

858
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:35,280
<i>And I am yours</i>

859
00:43:40,702 --> 00:43:42,704
<i>My love...</i>

860
00:43:45,707 --> 00:43:48,043
- Is that candy?
- I don't know.

861
00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:55,384
It is candy.

862
00:43:56,718 --> 00:43:58,971
- I like you.
- I like you.

863
00:43:59,847 --> 00:44:01,557
Tell me something about you.

864
00:44:02,224 --> 00:44:05,352
Well, I'm 19 years old.
My middle name is Courtney.

865
00:44:05,561 --> 00:44:09,106
I can always guess how many
jelly beans are in a jelly bean jar,

866
00:44:09,189 --> 00:44:10,566
even if it's not right.

867
00:44:10,816 --> 00:44:12,234
What about you?

868
00:44:12,568 --> 00:44:14,653
My name is Chani Lastnamé.

869
00:44:14,736 --> 00:44:17,447
I'm a real go-getter
and a person people.

870
00:44:17,865 --> 00:44:22,161
I can type 50 words a minute
with only 300 errors.

871
00:44:22,744 --> 00:44:24,788
I'm trained and certified...

872
00:44:24,872 --> 00:44:26,832
To fire a
military-grade missile launcher.

873
00:44:26,915 --> 00:44:27,916
Me, too.

874
00:44:29,209 --> 00:44:32,212
Chani, I just got
these phone messages from last week.

875
00:44:32,296 --> 00:44:33,714
You mailed them to me?

876
00:44:33,797 --> 00:44:35,883
How else was I gonna get them to you?

877
00:44:36,216 --> 00:44:37,885
You hand them to me.

878
00:44:39,219 --> 00:44:41,638
You are the dumbest person
I've met in my entire life,

879
00:44:41,722 --> 00:44:44,016
and that's not an exaggeration.

880
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:45,267
That makes me feel bad.

881
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:47,477
Well, it's the truth, Chani.

882
00:44:47,561 --> 00:44:49,104
You!

883
00:44:49,479 --> 00:44:52,357
- Leave her alone!
- Excuse me, sir.

884
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:57,070
Get your filthy hands off of her!

885
00:44:57,154 --> 00:44:58,363
Help, help!

886
00:44:58,447 --> 00:44:59,531
Excuse me, sir!

887
00:44:59,615 --> 00:45:01,783
- Leave me alone, lady!
- Excuse me!

888
00:45:01,867 --> 00:45:04,620
She is a goddess among women!

889
00:45:07,372 --> 00:45:08,624
Glen!

890
00:45:09,249 --> 00:45:10,876
My phone messages!

891
00:45:10,959 --> 00:45:12,961
Leave him alone!

892
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:14,296
Not today!

893
00:45:14,922 --> 00:45:17,799
- She has butterflies in her heart!
- Chani!

894
00:45:17,883 --> 00:45:20,761
I can see you behind that desk,
and you're fired!

895
00:45:20,844 --> 00:45:21,970
Why?

896
00:45:30,938 --> 00:45:32,481
Are you okay?

897
00:45:33,106 --> 00:45:34,983
You saved my life.

898
00:45:35,442 --> 00:45:37,319
She was trying to set me on fire.

899
00:45:37,653 --> 00:45:40,113
I didn't ask for these powers.

900
00:45:40,197 --> 00:45:41,657
I was given them.

901
00:45:41,949 --> 00:45:45,911
Last night a bird chased me,

902
00:45:46,286 --> 00:45:48,288
and I wished it was you.

903
00:45:49,289 --> 00:45:50,832
Can we go to a date?

904
00:45:50,916 --> 00:45:52,668
Yes.

905
00:46:06,974 --> 00:46:10,310
Dear God, please help me pull this off.

906
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:14,773
I swear, if you help me,
I will become a monk.

907
00:46:14,856 --> 00:46:17,859
I will shave my head
and become a monk...

908
00:46:18,318 --> 00:46:20,862
Who are we kidding?
I'm not going to do that.

909
00:46:21,029 --> 00:46:22,281
Did you hear?

910
00:46:22,364 --> 00:46:24,241
Evan said there's
some strange copy in the prompter.

911
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:25,951
It's 2:00 a.m.

912
00:46:26,034 --> 00:46:28,161
It's Freddie Shapp's ass, not mine.
Let's go.

913
00:46:28,245 --> 00:46:31,957
<i>People who change history
are rarely aware of it while doing so.</i>

914
00:46:32,708 --> 00:46:37,713
<i>Ron and his news team simply thought
they were making the news more fun.</i>

915
00:46:38,046 --> 00:46:43,135
<i>Little did they know they were changing
the course of broadcast history forever.</i>

916
00:46:43,218 --> 00:46:46,221
Hello, America.
It's 2:00 a.m. Eastern time.

917
00:46:46,596 --> 00:46:51,977
I'm Ron Burgundy,
and tonight's top story is America.

918
00:46:52,227 --> 00:46:54,021
She's the greatest country in the world.

919
00:46:54,146 --> 00:46:55,981
<i>Heck, the history of the world!</i>

920
00:46:56,064 --> 00:46:57,149
You're damn right!

921
00:46:59,735 --> 00:47:02,279
<i>Too much of the news
is about what's wrong with America.</i>

922
00:47:02,362 --> 00:47:03,322
Amen, brother!

923
00:47:03,405 --> 00:47:06,283
Well, tonight, our top story
is what's right with America.

924
00:47:06,825 --> 00:47:09,119
Someone's finally
talking sense on the TV.

925
00:47:09,202 --> 00:47:11,538
For starters, we kick butt.

926
00:47:11,621 --> 00:47:13,915
Nazi butt. Russian butt.

927
00:47:14,082 --> 00:47:15,500
What the hell is he doing?

928
00:47:15,584 --> 00:47:17,085
He's talking about America.

929
00:47:17,169 --> 00:47:18,462
Why, do you have a problem with that?

930
00:47:18,754 --> 00:47:21,340
Tonight I begin part one
of my 11-part series

931
00:47:21,423 --> 00:47:24,176
on the power and mystery
of the human vagina.

932
00:47:24,426 --> 00:47:28,638
<i>This series will be a tasteful look
at just what makes that weird thing tick,</i>

933
00:47:28,847 --> 00:47:32,517
<i>as well as a look at the 50 greatest
gi-gi's of the 20th century.</i>

934
00:47:32,768 --> 00:47:33,894
Son of a bitch!

935
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,272
<i>One final question, and I'll let you go.</i>

936
00:47:37,397 --> 00:47:40,359
Who tops the list
of the top 50 greatest 'ginas?

937
00:47:40,442 --> 00:47:42,611
Well, I don't want to give anything away.

938
00:47:43,737 --> 00:47:44,780
I thought I had you.

939
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:46,698
I will give you number two.

940
00:47:46,782 --> 00:47:47,991
- Please.
- Madame Curie.

941
00:47:48,075 --> 00:47:49,743
Of course. Of course.

942
00:47:50,035 --> 00:47:51,370
Whammy! Whammy!

943
00:47:51,453 --> 00:47:53,246
Whammy! Whammy! Whammy!

944
00:47:53,330 --> 00:47:55,207
Whammy!

945
00:48:00,921 --> 00:48:02,005
<i>Whammy!</i>

946
00:48:02,089 --> 00:48:03,215
Back to you, Ron.

947
00:48:03,423 --> 00:48:06,218
The wind is really windy.

948
00:48:06,301 --> 00:48:08,720
Brick? Brick, can you hear me?

949
00:48:08,804 --> 00:48:10,389
I can't hear you, Ron!

950
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:14,351
Okay, but you're answering the
question, so I think you can hear me.

951
00:48:14,476 --> 00:48:15,519
No, I can!

952
00:48:15,644 --> 00:48:18,772
Brick, do you think there is any danger
to the average person out there?

953
00:48:18,855 --> 00:48:21,316
<i>I'm afraid for the animals
of New York, Ron.</i>

954
00:48:21,817 --> 00:48:26,238
I saw a woman,
and her dog never touched the ground.

955
00:48:26,446 --> 00:48:29,950
You're saying wind gusts
as fast as a supersonic jet?

956
00:48:30,158 --> 00:48:32,536
It looked like
she was walking a dog balloon.

957
00:48:32,869 --> 00:48:34,162
And go... Switch.

958
00:48:34,538 --> 00:48:37,916
And for our eighth
and final animal story of the night,

959
00:48:37,999 --> 00:48:40,710
it looks like residents
of North Yulk, Montana,

960
00:48:40,794 --> 00:48:44,214
have found the cutest little patriot
on God's green earth.

961
00:48:47,801 --> 00:48:49,344
Look at that little guy!

962
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:53,181
He was having some fun.

963
00:48:53,974 --> 00:48:58,562
Well, for all of us here at GNN,
I'm Ron Burgundy.

964
00:48:58,645 --> 00:49:02,983
And don't just have a great night,
have an American night.

965
00:49:06,111 --> 00:49:07,529
And we're out!

966
00:49:10,115 --> 00:49:13,326
- I couldn't take my eyes off the screen!
- Yes.

967
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:15,871
You were electric, Ron! Whammy!

968
00:49:15,954 --> 00:49:17,789
That just felt right! That felt right!

969
00:49:17,873 --> 00:49:19,040
I was outside!

970
00:49:19,124 --> 00:49:21,460
You sure were, Brick. Wonderful job.

971
00:49:21,543 --> 00:49:23,044
Amazing. Great job.

972
00:49:23,128 --> 00:49:26,882
What the hell was that?
What the hell was that?

973
00:49:27,382 --> 00:49:30,260
Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy, Linda.
We were just trying something new.

974
00:49:30,343 --> 00:49:32,596
You changed the format of
the entire show without consulting me?

975
00:49:32,679 --> 00:49:33,680
That's unacceptable!

976
00:49:33,972 --> 00:49:36,933
Damn straight, sister.
We just done went and brought it!

977
00:49:37,017 --> 00:49:39,603
And here's the truth.
You can't handle it, little mama!

978
00:49:39,686 --> 00:49:42,355
Get out!
You are all terminated immediately.

979
00:49:42,731 --> 00:49:44,399
If you were a man, I'd knock you out.

980
00:49:44,691 --> 00:49:47,360
Really? Well, go ahead!

981
00:49:47,444 --> 00:49:49,571
Take a swing! Take your best shot!

982
00:49:50,238 --> 00:49:51,448
I have five brothers,

983
00:49:51,531 --> 00:49:53,658
and two of them are defensive backs
in the NFL, so come on!

984
00:49:53,742 --> 00:49:55,368
- You want me to do it?
- Yeah.

985
00:49:55,452 --> 00:49:56,953
This thing's not gonna feel good.

986
00:49:57,037 --> 00:49:57,996
Do it, Ron. Just do it.

987
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:00,123
Are you scared? What's the problem?

988
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:02,250
Is he a chicken? Are you a chicken?

989
00:50:05,754 --> 00:50:06,922
I'm not a chicken at all.

990
00:50:07,047 --> 00:50:09,341
I'm going to make
that mustache of yours all bloody.

991
00:50:11,176 --> 00:50:12,302
Well...

992
00:50:12,802 --> 00:50:14,513
Seems like you're buying time, Ron.

993
00:50:14,596 --> 00:50:16,014
I'm not buying time.

994
00:50:16,097 --> 00:50:19,684
Ron! Just do what men have been doing
for thousands of years,

995
00:50:19,768 --> 00:50:21,353
and punch the woman.

996
00:50:21,436 --> 00:50:22,729
- Punch her!
- You're stalling.

997
00:50:22,812 --> 00:50:23,813
Punch the woman!

998
00:50:23,897 --> 00:50:26,858
Here comes the Toledo Express.
All aboard!

999
00:50:30,612 --> 00:50:31,988
Ron!No!

1000
00:50:34,241 --> 00:50:35,617
I didn't do it!

1001
00:50:37,953 --> 00:50:40,622
Mama, your baby's hurt.

1002
00:50:41,122 --> 00:50:42,624
Your baby.

1003
00:50:44,167 --> 00:50:46,795
What is that sound you're making?
Good Lord!

1004
00:50:48,588 --> 00:50:50,632
You sound like a balloon.

1005
00:50:50,882 --> 00:50:52,300
Pull yourself together, man.

1006
00:50:52,467 --> 00:50:53,718
Security!

1007
00:50:53,802 --> 00:50:55,637
They saw my pee-pee.

1008
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:58,557
The eighth grade boys saw my pee-pee!

1009
00:50:58,848 --> 00:51:00,725
Did you say they saw your pee-pee?

1010
00:51:00,809 --> 00:51:03,270
In the locker room,
they saw my pee-pee.

1011
00:51:03,603 --> 00:51:05,730
You just knocked him
back into fifth grade.

1012
00:51:05,814 --> 00:51:06,982
Get him out of here!

1013
00:51:08,608 --> 00:51:10,527
Bugger me with a didgeridoo.

1014
00:51:10,819 --> 00:51:12,112
We knew we'd struggle to start,

1015
00:51:12,195 --> 00:51:14,739
but these ratings
are lower than I'd even imagined.

1016
00:51:14,823 --> 00:51:16,700
Thank God for the 2:00 a.m. spike.

1017
00:51:16,783 --> 00:51:18,535
It really saved our whole launch.

1018
00:51:18,785 --> 00:51:21,079
Spike? What are you talking about?

1019
00:51:21,496 --> 00:51:22,497
What spike?

1020
00:51:22,706 --> 00:51:24,749
Burgundy. Who's Ron Burgundy?

1021
00:51:24,833 --> 00:51:26,918
No, no, no, this can't be right.

1022
00:51:28,211 --> 00:51:32,882
His team start at a .2,
and then they finish at a 5.6?

1023
00:51:32,966 --> 00:51:36,136
That's unbelievable!
They tripled Jack Lime's numbers!

1024
00:51:36,219 --> 00:51:39,389
How is that even possible?
Who are these guys?

1025
00:51:39,764 --> 00:51:42,350
They're a local team out of San Diego.

1026
00:51:42,684 --> 00:51:43,852
You little beauty!

1027
00:51:44,019 --> 00:51:45,854
Well, they no longer work for us.

1028
00:51:48,023 --> 00:51:49,232
I fired them.

1029
00:51:49,566 --> 00:51:54,821
Well, guys, it goes without saying
I owe you gentlemen an apology.

1030
00:51:54,988 --> 00:51:59,826
I dragged you out here and this thing
was a disaster from the word "go."

1031
00:51:59,909 --> 00:52:02,495
No, Ron, don't you beat yourself up.

1032
00:52:02,579 --> 00:52:04,205
Yeah, it's all right, Ron.

1033
00:52:04,372 --> 00:52:05,540
Gin.

1034
00:52:06,875 --> 00:52:08,835
Brian, any idea what you might do next?

1035
00:52:08,918 --> 00:52:10,253
Gonna head back to L.A.

1036
00:52:10,337 --> 00:52:11,963
I got a good group of buddies out there.

1037
00:52:12,047 --> 00:52:14,841
O.J. Simpson.
Phil Spector. Robert Blake.

1038
00:52:14,924 --> 00:52:16,635
Sounds like a fun crew.

1039
00:52:16,718 --> 00:52:18,386
We go out cruising chicks.

1040
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:20,138
Call ourselves the "Ladykillers."

1041
00:52:20,221 --> 00:52:22,724
I love that name. You should get it
on the back of matching jackets.

1042
00:52:22,807 --> 00:52:24,309
That's not a bad idea.

1043
00:52:27,771 --> 00:52:29,564
Guys?

1044
00:52:31,441 --> 00:52:32,692
Hey.

1045
00:52:32,901 --> 00:52:34,736
I got some news.

1046
00:52:34,903 --> 00:52:37,656
Freddie, we don't exactly want to hear
the word "news" right now.

1047
00:52:37,781 --> 00:52:38,990
Yeah.

1048
00:52:39,074 --> 00:52:42,577
You're right. Forget it.
Forget I was even here.

1049
00:52:43,078 --> 00:52:45,955
Forget that GNN wants you back.

1050
00:52:46,706 --> 00:52:50,919
For a prime time slot and a raise in pay.

1051
00:52:51,294 --> 00:52:54,506
Quit yanking our penises, Freddie!
What's the deal?

1052
00:52:54,589 --> 00:52:56,841
Yeah! Quit yanking our anuses.

1053
00:52:56,925 --> 00:52:59,135
No. I'm not yanking your...

1054
00:53:00,762 --> 00:53:03,556
Your ratings went through the roof.

1055
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:06,351
People love what you did.

1056
00:53:07,018 --> 00:53:08,937
You're a success!

1057
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:13,775
Get it? You're a great, big, fat success!

1058
00:53:14,275 --> 00:53:16,736
By the bed pan of Gene Rayburn!

1059
00:53:17,112 --> 00:53:19,823
It's total crap
and they can't stop watching!

1060
00:53:20,448 --> 00:53:23,326
<i>The news team
had been famous in San Diego,</i>

1061
00:53:23,410 --> 00:53:26,538
<i>but that was small time
compared to New York.</i>

1062
00:53:27,163 --> 00:53:29,332
<i>This fame was a rocket ship.</i>

1063
00:53:29,416 --> 00:53:33,878
<i>A rocket ship that had free drinks
and topless stewardesses.</i>

1064
00:53:33,962 --> 00:53:35,922
That'll do it for all of us here at GNN.

1065
00:53:36,005 --> 00:53:39,592
Thank God for the events,
thank me for the news.

1066
00:53:39,676 --> 00:53:41,094
I'm Jack...

1067
00:53:44,222 --> 00:53:45,348
...Lame.

1068
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:51,354
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

1069
00:53:51,438 --> 00:53:52,731
More graphics, all right?

1070
00:53:52,814 --> 00:53:54,399
But there's already a lot.

1071
00:53:54,482 --> 00:53:56,735
Hey, you heard the man. More graphics.

1072
00:53:56,818 --> 00:53:59,404
Let a citizen ask a question here,
for God's sake!

1073
00:53:59,487 --> 00:54:02,949
Can Father Ron please shut his mouth
for just half a second?

1074
00:54:05,493 --> 00:54:09,330
This is against everything
that I have worked for my entire life.

1075
00:54:09,414 --> 00:54:10,665
Honey, come on.

1076
00:54:35,106 --> 00:54:39,110
If you're like me, you need an underwear
that fits your active lifestyle.

1077
00:54:39,194 --> 00:54:41,946
<i>At finer specialty
and department stores.</i>

1078
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:44,783
<i>I'm weatherman Brick Tamland,
and I like butter.</i>

1079
00:54:44,866 --> 00:54:48,995
<i>Butter is nutritious and it tastes great.</i>

1080
00:54:49,496 --> 00:54:51,164
<i>Butter!</i>

1081
00:54:52,999 --> 00:54:55,460
There's something new
on the New York social scene.

1082
00:54:55,543 --> 00:54:57,170
It's fun, relatively benign

1083
00:54:57,253 --> 00:55:00,632
and costs about as much
as a soda pop at the local drugstore.

1084
00:55:00,715 --> 00:55:02,133
Here's Brian Fantana

1085
00:55:02,217 --> 00:55:06,638
on why everyone who is someone
is lighting up to smoke crack.

1086
00:55:06,721 --> 00:55:09,098
Now, Brian,
I understand we have some crack

1087
00:55:09,182 --> 00:55:10,892
and we're going to smoke it
right here in the studio.

1088
00:55:10,975 --> 00:55:12,185
I don't know if we can get a shot of that.

1089
00:55:12,268 --> 00:55:14,145
What is that? Did you know
they were gonna have that?

1090
00:55:14,229 --> 00:55:15,313
No.

1091
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:18,107
Now, what you're gonna do is,
you're gonna put this in your pipe.

1092
00:55:18,191 --> 00:55:20,777
Is that where the phrase "Put it in your
pipe and smoke it" comes from?

1093
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:22,320
I don't care.

1094
00:55:25,490 --> 00:55:27,826
You feel that right away.

1095
00:55:30,453 --> 00:55:34,332
Well, now we know, guys,
you can't smoke crack on live television.

1096
00:55:46,052 --> 00:55:47,178
Hey, gang.

1097
00:55:47,262 --> 00:55:49,347
You know what would
make this great day even better?

1098
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:50,431
What?

1099
00:55:50,598 --> 00:55:52,559
Perms for everyone!

1100
00:56:05,572 --> 00:56:07,407
Please come in and shut the door.

1101
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:14,163
If this is about sweeps,

1102
00:56:14,247 --> 00:56:17,083
I think Brian Fantana
found an outstanding story.

1103
00:56:17,166 --> 00:56:19,377
It's about airplane parts

1104
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:24,549
that are falling off of airplanes out of
the sky and hitting the ground, people.

1105
00:56:24,632 --> 00:56:26,634
We're calling it "Death From Above."
We might do some...

1106
00:56:26,718 --> 00:56:28,303
You. Come here.

1107
00:56:33,474 --> 00:56:35,226
I've been watching you.

1108
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:36,644
You have?

1109
00:56:38,187 --> 00:56:40,315
I've been watching you a lot.

1110
00:56:41,608 --> 00:56:43,234
And you just do whatever you want.

1111
00:56:43,318 --> 00:56:45,987
Well, I'm a bit of a maverick, I guess.

1112
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:47,822
You don't follow the format.

1113
00:56:47,906 --> 00:56:52,493
You pretty much walk around
like you're king of the world.

1114
00:56:52,827 --> 00:56:55,496
I'm just a worker bee. That's all I am.

1115
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:57,957
- You know what?
- What?

1116
00:57:02,879 --> 00:57:04,672
I find it hot as shit!

1117
00:57:05,048 --> 00:57:06,841
Are you going to hurt me?

1118
00:57:06,925 --> 00:57:08,384
Here's the thing, Mr. Burgundy.

1119
00:57:08,468 --> 00:57:11,179
You're a shooting star
and I want to go for a ride.

1120
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:13,431
God, I'm so afraid right now.

1121
00:57:13,514 --> 00:57:15,558
Now, I want to hear you meow like a cat.

1122
00:57:19,979 --> 00:57:21,773
Now, I want you to bark like a dog.

1123
00:57:21,856 --> 00:57:23,733
Bark. Bark. Bark!

1124
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,027
Like a puppy. Like a puppy.

1125
00:57:31,407 --> 00:57:32,951
Yeah. Come on! Do it!

1126
00:57:36,704 --> 00:57:38,247
Don't cry.

1127
00:57:39,791 --> 00:57:43,169
It's sexual and yet frightening.
It's an odd mixture.

1128
00:57:44,003 --> 00:57:45,046
Come in.

1129
00:57:46,047 --> 00:57:47,298
Linda.

1130
00:57:47,382 --> 00:57:49,342
Excuse me, Linda.

1131
00:57:49,717 --> 00:57:51,844
Ron, Jack wants to know

1132
00:57:51,928 --> 00:57:55,306
if he can go back to calling himself
Jack Lime instead of Jack Lame.

1133
00:57:55,390 --> 00:57:56,891
He's really struggling with it.

1134
00:57:57,016 --> 00:57:59,560
No. Can't. It's a bet.

1135
00:57:59,769 --> 00:58:01,312
Jesus!

1136
00:58:01,396 --> 00:58:03,022
If you want to change it, you can.

1137
00:58:03,481 --> 00:58:04,607
Like what?

1138
00:58:04,691 --> 00:58:05,775
Art Areola.

1139
00:58:05,858 --> 00:58:08,069
No! No, that's worse!
You know it's worse!

1140
00:58:08,486 --> 00:58:10,488
Lyle Tit or Steve Anus.

1141
00:58:10,947 --> 00:58:12,323
Steve An use.

1142
00:58:12,407 --> 00:58:15,326
- No, you've got to say "Anus."
- Got to say "Anus."

1143
00:58:15,410 --> 00:58:16,369
Freddie, I can't.

1144
00:58:16,452 --> 00:58:19,288
Listen to me, Burgundy.
This is far from over, do you hear me?

1145
00:58:20,289 --> 00:58:22,375
I'll see you on the playground.

1146
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:26,754
Well.

1147
00:58:28,172 --> 00:58:34,095
This meeting has been very productive.

1148
00:58:34,178 --> 00:58:36,055
You can pick me up at 8:00.

1149
00:58:36,431 --> 00:58:40,768
Okay, I'm very confused
by what's going on here.

1150
00:58:41,728 --> 00:58:42,854
Get out!

1151
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:53,865
Ron.

1152
00:58:53,948 --> 00:58:59,162
Ron, you are missing some real
high-quality Garfield laughs over here!

1153
00:58:59,245 --> 00:59:01,039
I think our boss just raped me.

1154
00:59:01,122 --> 00:59:02,206
What?

1155
00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:03,916
I don't know what happened.

1156
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,710
All a bit of a blur.

1157
00:59:05,793 --> 00:59:09,422
There was hands and hair,
and breath, and lips.

1158
00:59:09,505 --> 00:59:11,132
There might have been
other people, I don't know.

1159
00:59:11,215 --> 00:59:12,508
Sounds like she wants you.

1160
00:59:12,592 --> 00:59:13,634
Hey, man.

1161
00:59:13,718 --> 00:59:15,928
Women have been all over me
since we got crazy famous.

1162
00:59:16,012 --> 00:59:19,640
Not to brag or anything, but I just gave
Florence Henderson crabs.

1163
00:59:19,807 --> 00:59:23,102
That is in no way a brag, Brian.
That's horrible.

1164
00:59:23,478 --> 00:59:26,147
The mom of The <i>Brady Bunch</i>
had a fun time with you,

1165
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:28,024
and then woke up the next day and...

1166
00:59:28,107 --> 00:59:30,818
I gave her
a whole Brady Bunch of crabs.

1167
00:59:30,985 --> 00:59:33,905
Sounds to me like it's her fault
for being a randy gal.

1168
00:59:33,988 --> 00:59:35,364
I have a date!

1169
00:59:35,448 --> 00:59:36,741
Brick has a date?

1170
00:59:36,824 --> 00:59:37,909
Good for Brick!

1171
00:59:37,992 --> 00:59:39,160
What's a date?

1172
00:59:39,243 --> 00:59:41,662
A date is simply
when two people get together,

1173
00:59:41,746 --> 00:59:44,457
do something social, have a few drinks,
yadda-yadda-yadda...

1174
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:45,708
Take their shirts off...

1175
00:59:47,335 --> 00:59:49,128
-it's okay.
- No, it's a fun thing.

1176
00:59:49,212 --> 00:59:50,588
It's fun. It's all right.

1177
00:59:50,671 --> 00:59:53,549
Look. Don't worry, Brick,
we got your back, okay?

1178
00:59:53,841 --> 00:59:57,470
First things first,
we need to get you a little protection.

1179
01:00:01,474 --> 01:00:02,642
There it is.

1180
01:00:02,892 --> 01:00:04,977
Let the angels blow their trumpets.

1181
01:00:05,269 --> 01:00:09,065
Brian Fantana's
world-famous jimmy cabinet.

1182
01:00:10,358 --> 01:00:12,068
For you, I'm thinking...

1183
01:00:13,277 --> 01:00:15,029
The Gentle Mongoose.

1184
01:00:15,113 --> 01:00:17,949
It's made out of real mongoose hair,
so it doesn't work.

1185
01:00:18,282 --> 01:00:23,579
All the romance of
a wiry-haired weasel that kills snakes.

1186
01:00:23,704 --> 01:00:25,206
It feels amazing, though.

1187
01:00:25,373 --> 01:00:26,415
Wait, wait, wait.

1188
01:00:26,707 --> 01:00:27,834
- You thinking what I'm thinking?
- Yep.

1189
01:00:28,084 --> 01:00:29,544
Lou Dobin's Good Time Weiner Pouch.

1190
01:00:30,002 --> 01:00:31,379
That's a good one.

1191
01:00:31,712 --> 01:00:34,507
"If it's quality, it's Dobin's."

1192
01:00:34,715 --> 01:00:37,718
They're made of denim,
so they look better after each washing.

1193
01:00:37,969 --> 01:00:39,428
Talk about a great time.

1194
01:00:39,512 --> 01:00:42,181
Wait a minute. I've got it.

1195
01:00:43,516 --> 01:00:44,976
The Rigid Ghost.

1196
01:00:45,059 --> 01:00:47,478
It's the best damn rubber on the market.

1197
01:00:47,562 --> 01:00:51,357
I got four of my seven
illegitimate children using this condom.

1198
01:00:51,482 --> 01:00:54,402
But, Brian, isn't that the whole point
of wearing a condom?

1199
01:00:54,485 --> 01:00:56,320
To not impregnate the woman?

1200
01:00:56,529 --> 01:00:59,407
Well, you know the old expression.
"Nope-ll

1201
01:01:03,911 --> 01:01:05,037
Thank you, Ron,

1202
01:01:05,121 --> 01:01:09,167
and happy St. Patrick's Day
to all of our Native American friends.

1203
01:01:09,250 --> 01:01:10,543
On the big map...

1204
01:01:12,545 --> 01:01:13,462
Where's my map?

1205
01:01:14,255 --> 01:01:16,132
There's no map, it's just green.

1206
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:18,467
No, there's a map there.
Look at the monitor.

1207
01:01:18,593 --> 01:01:20,928
Right.

1208
01:01:21,012 --> 01:01:22,471
Ron, where's my legs?

1209
01:01:22,555 --> 01:01:24,307
- Where are my legs?
- Your legs are there.

1210
01:01:24,390 --> 01:01:25,933
I don't have any legs, Ron.

1211
01:01:26,142 --> 01:01:28,436
I don't even know how I'm standing up.

1212
01:01:30,438 --> 01:01:32,023
Brick, your legs are fine.

1213
01:01:32,106 --> 01:01:34,442
The color of your pants just matches...

1214
01:01:34,775 --> 01:01:36,444
Ron, I don't have any legs!

1215
01:01:36,569 --> 01:01:37,612
The Chroma-Key behind you.

1216
01:01:37,737 --> 01:01:39,614
Ninety-three?

1217
01:01:39,697 --> 01:01:42,200
Ninety-three?

1218
01:01:42,283 --> 01:01:43,451
Relax.

1219
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:50,499
And after I received my
Masters in Journalism from Columbia,

1220
01:01:50,583 --> 01:01:54,212
I got a job with the London bureau
for ABC News.

1221
01:01:54,295 --> 01:01:55,421
London.

1222
01:01:55,671 --> 01:02:00,301
You're so impressive, and I've
only been out of the United States twice.

1223
01:02:00,718 --> 01:02:02,220
A handful of times in Mexico,

1224
01:02:02,303 --> 01:02:06,599
and then the second time I left the
country, we went to Salem, Oregon.

1225
01:02:07,058 --> 01:02:08,517
Mr. Burgundy, are you nervous?

1226
01:02:08,726 --> 01:02:09,727
God, yes.

1227
01:02:09,977 --> 01:02:12,063
Did I scare you by coming on so strong?

1228
01:02:12,396 --> 01:02:13,606
A little bit, sure.

1229
01:02:14,065 --> 01:02:16,234
Look, it's not that you're not attractive...

1230
01:02:16,317 --> 01:02:18,319
It's just I'm a little old-fashioned.

1231
01:02:18,611 --> 01:02:21,364
Well, I am a modern woman.

1232
01:02:21,739 --> 01:02:25,826
And let me tell you, when I
see something that I want, I go for it.

1233
01:02:26,202 --> 01:02:27,828
Can I ask you a question?

1234
01:02:28,996 --> 01:02:31,457
Is that your foot between my legs?

1235
01:02:31,624 --> 01:02:32,667
No.

1236
01:02:32,833 --> 01:02:34,752
I'm sorry.

1237
01:02:35,628 --> 01:02:37,088
It was my hand.

1238
01:02:37,213 --> 01:02:38,214
So...

1239
01:02:38,422 --> 01:02:39,674
We're going to do this, aren't we?

1240
01:02:40,007 --> 01:02:43,469
We most definitely are gonna do this.

1241
01:02:43,761 --> 01:02:49,225
I feel a little awkward, because
I'm about to have sex with a black lady!

1242
01:02:49,308 --> 01:02:51,185
I'm sorry! I'm sorry.

1243
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:54,355
That's not the way
I like to handle my business.

1244
01:02:54,772 --> 01:02:58,776
When I get nervous, I sometimes
lose control of the volume of my voice.

1245
01:02:59,151 --> 01:03:02,655
Well, I don't mind,
because I am going to have you tonight.

1246
01:03:03,114 --> 01:03:06,284
Then let's leave
and go have interracial sex!

1247
01:03:08,119 --> 01:03:09,370
Sorry.

1248
01:03:50,244 --> 01:03:52,663
This is the nicest soda machine
anyone's ever taken me to.

1249
01:03:53,247 --> 01:03:56,334
The beauty of this soda machine
pales in comparison to your beauty.

1250
01:04:02,923 --> 01:04:04,675
Can I ask you a personal question?

1251
01:04:04,925 --> 01:04:06,677
I'm not sure what that is, but yes.

1252
01:04:06,886 --> 01:04:08,596
Have you ever kissed anyone?

1253
01:04:09,347 --> 01:04:12,558
Do faces on the TV screen and
Planet of the Apes action figures count?

1254
01:04:13,267 --> 01:04:14,435
Of course.

1255
01:04:14,602 --> 01:04:16,103
Then, yes.

1256
01:04:16,187 --> 01:04:18,898
I have kissed
Angie Dickinson and Dr. Zaius.

1257
01:04:20,232 --> 01:04:22,234
I've only kissed people in my dreams.

1258
01:04:22,485 --> 01:04:27,573
So, I've only kissed a tiny dragon
and a woman with her hair on fire.

1259
01:04:27,907 --> 01:04:32,536
I don't have a lot of experience
with kissing, but I do know one thing...

1260
01:04:32,787 --> 01:04:34,497
Always get your teeth involved.

1261
01:04:35,206 --> 01:04:38,334
I think I'm ready
to maybe try that kiss thing now.

1262
01:05:15,413 --> 01:05:16,956
Hello, Ms. Jackson.

1263
01:05:17,665 --> 01:05:18,999
I didn't mean to scare you.

1264
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:21,794
Mr. Allenby, I wasn't expecting you to...

1265
01:05:22,211 --> 01:05:24,338
Yeah, no, I know. Neither was I.

1266
01:05:25,339 --> 01:05:26,924
But then I heard about this little story

1267
01:05:27,007 --> 01:05:29,927
that Ron Burgundy and Brian Fantana
are running.

1268
01:05:30,219 --> 01:05:32,263
You see,
some of the planes from my airline

1269
01:05:32,346 --> 01:05:34,306
have had parts falling off them lately.

1270
01:05:34,682 --> 01:05:36,517
Is it a problem? Yeah.

1271
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:39,562
Is it being fixed? I don't know, probably.

1272
01:05:39,854 --> 01:05:43,315
But if that story runs,
then Koala stock will plummet.

1273
01:05:43,858 --> 01:05:46,694
We can't just pull the story.
That would be unethical.

1274
01:05:46,986 --> 01:05:50,114
We own the news.
We can do whatever we want.

1275
01:05:50,573 --> 01:05:52,324
That's one of the perks.

1276
01:05:52,658 --> 01:05:56,328
It's called "synergy."
One company working with another.

1277
01:05:59,874 --> 01:06:01,333
To synergy-

1278
01:06:09,592 --> 01:06:12,052
You seem a little quiet, I must say.

1279
01:06:12,470 --> 01:06:16,182
Just so you know, I'm absolutely fine
with going to this family dinner.

1280
01:06:16,891 --> 01:06:18,559
They're going to love you.

1281
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:21,729
This is delicious!

1282
01:06:23,689 --> 01:06:24,690
So...

1283
01:06:25,357 --> 01:06:26,942
How long
have you and Linda been dating?

1284
01:06:27,359 --> 01:06:28,402
Mother.

1285
01:06:29,570 --> 01:06:31,739
No, it's all right. It's a logical question.

1286
01:06:33,365 --> 01:06:37,661
Ours is a new love,
but it burns very brightly.

1287
01:06:38,621 --> 01:06:42,541
And it gets hot and sweaty and stanky.

1288
01:06:42,625 --> 01:06:45,085
There's some stank on that love.

1289
01:06:45,419 --> 01:06:46,587
What are you talking about?

1290
01:06:47,004 --> 01:06:49,340
We been rockin' that headboard
every night.

1291
01:06:49,423 --> 01:06:52,259
Am I right? Say what?

1292
01:06:52,343 --> 01:06:55,054
Now, we don't have
conversations like that over dinner.

1293
01:06:55,137 --> 01:06:59,099
I'm just saying
I'm knocking those boots 24/7, my man.

1294
01:06:59,892 --> 01:07:01,268
Give it to me.

1295
01:07:01,685 --> 01:07:02,937
Put your hand down.

1296
01:07:03,103 --> 01:07:04,063
Ron, what are you doing?

1297
01:07:04,146 --> 01:07:07,024
I'm addressing
the white elephant in the room.

1298
01:07:07,107 --> 01:07:10,194
I'm breaking down the barriers
of race by assimilation.

1299
01:07:10,277 --> 01:07:12,613
- That's all I'm doing.
- Well, you're coming off like a jerk.

1300
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:14,365
I think it's going well.

1301
01:07:14,448 --> 01:07:17,284
I understand you're
making quite an impact at the station.

1302
01:07:17,451 --> 01:07:19,203
All I've done is tried my best.

1303
01:07:19,537 --> 01:07:22,414
I walk around that office, I'm lookin' fly,

1304
01:07:22,957 --> 01:07:24,124
and the first thing I did,

1305
01:07:24,208 --> 01:07:27,586
I walk through those doors, and I walk
right up to that white devil boss and say,

1306
01:07:27,670 --> 01:07:30,631
"Hey, boss man! Hey, boss man!
I'm talkin' to you!

1307
01:07:30,798 --> 01:07:32,758
"You gots to pay me!
Where's my paper?

1308
01:07:32,841 --> 01:07:34,677
"You gots to pay me in paper!"

1309
01:07:34,802 --> 01:07:37,888
If you haven't noticed,
we don't converse like that.

1310
01:07:37,972 --> 01:07:39,807
Okay, okay.

1311
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:41,892
Look at big papa down here.

1312
01:07:42,017 --> 01:07:44,270
He's saying to himself,
"Shit! Look at this honky.

1313
01:07:44,353 --> 01:07:49,858
"Sittin' at my table, eatin' all my food.
Drinking my Ripple! What?"

1314
01:07:50,025 --> 01:07:51,652
Oh, my goodness!

1315
01:07:51,819 --> 01:07:54,822
"I'm gonna sic that pit bull on him.
Hey, Cujo, get in here!"

1316
01:07:54,905 --> 01:07:57,908
Linda, I don't understand
what you are doing with him.

1317
01:07:57,992 --> 01:08:01,537
You know what I'm comin' at you with,
you big black mother of Linda.

1318
01:08:01,620 --> 01:08:03,247
Mix it up in a pot!

1319
01:08:03,330 --> 01:08:05,833
- Makin' it spicy!
- Oh, my Lord.

1320
01:08:05,916 --> 01:08:08,669
- Hey. That's my mama, man.
- Please, don't do this.

1321
01:08:10,254 --> 01:08:11,589
Now, which one of you
pipe-hittin' bitches

1322
01:08:11,672 --> 01:08:12,715
can pass me the mashed potatoes?

1323
01:08:13,924 --> 01:08:15,926
I don't think
that dinner could've gone any better.

1324
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:17,136
Are you nuts?

1325
01:08:17,469 --> 01:08:20,014
No, I'm not! I had a wonderful evening!

1326
01:08:20,681 --> 01:08:22,474
My dad was kicking you in the head!

1327
01:08:22,725 --> 01:08:25,561
I thought it was like
being jumped into a gang.

1328
01:08:25,644 --> 01:08:27,021
Only with dinner guests!

1329
01:08:27,187 --> 01:08:29,523
You called my family
"pipe-hittin' bitches"!

1330
01:08:29,732 --> 01:08:34,028
I hate to pin it on you,
but you did invite me to dinner.

1331
01:08:34,737 --> 01:08:35,863
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1332
01:08:36,071 --> 01:08:37,698
- No, I'm sorry.
- I just...

1333
01:08:38,032 --> 01:08:41,619
I'm just under a lot of stress
because Allenby,

1334
01:08:41,702 --> 01:08:44,830
he doesn't want you to do
the story that you're doing for sweeps.

1335
01:08:45,497 --> 01:08:46,457
"Death From Above."

1336
01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:48,125
It's an excellent story.
Wonderful expose.

1337
01:08:48,208 --> 01:08:49,710
Listen, Ron.

1338
01:08:51,045 --> 01:08:53,047
Have you ever heard of synergy?

1339
01:08:59,053 --> 01:09:03,223
So your mom thought we should
get together, spend a little time.

1340
01:09:04,183 --> 01:09:07,770
She doesn't think
I connect with you as a child.

1341
01:09:09,188 --> 01:09:11,398
Can you believe that bullshit?

1342
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:14,610
Dad.

1343
01:09:14,985 --> 01:09:18,280
Sometimes I hear sounds at night
and I get scared.

1344
01:09:18,364 --> 01:09:21,116
I think there's a ghost in my closet.

1345
01:09:21,241 --> 01:09:22,910
Now, you listen to me, son.

1346
01:09:22,993 --> 01:09:26,830
There is no such thing as ghosts.
Case closed.

1347
01:09:27,247 --> 01:09:28,874
So what's real that's scary?

1348
01:09:28,957 --> 01:09:32,044
You really want to know
the one thing you should be afraid of?

1349
01:09:32,294 --> 01:09:33,921
Yes, I really do.

1350
01:09:34,421 --> 01:09:35,464
Voodoo.

1351
01:09:35,547 --> 01:09:37,675
- Voodoo?
- Yes, voodoo.

1352
01:09:37,758 --> 01:09:39,677
That shit will mess you up.

1353
01:09:39,927 --> 01:09:42,596
And it is 100% real.

1354
01:09:42,888 --> 01:09:45,933
Promise me that you'll never go to Haiti.

1355
01:09:46,308 --> 01:09:47,768
I promise, Dad.

1356
01:09:47,935 --> 01:09:50,104
This was good.
I enjoyed spending time with you.

1357
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:51,271
Me, too, Dad.

1358
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:53,774
And hey.
Do you want to go to Haiti sometime?

1359
01:09:53,941 --> 01:09:55,818
- No.
- Good. Good.

1360
01:09:56,026 --> 01:09:57,903
What did you tell him?

1361
01:09:58,028 --> 01:09:59,571
I didn't tell him anything.

1362
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:01,907
He hasn't slept for four days, Ron!

1363
01:10:02,157 --> 01:10:05,077
Everywhere we go,
he asks me if we're going to Haiti!

1364
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:06,286
What does that even mean?

1365
01:10:06,453 --> 01:10:11,333
I am so sick and tired that you've
sheltered him from the evils of voodoo.

1366
01:10:11,458 --> 01:10:14,294
You need to learn to
connect with him in a healthy way!

1367
01:10:14,378 --> 01:10:16,505
Let me ask you something,
and I'm not trying to be funny here.

1368
01:10:16,588 --> 01:10:19,133
Are you sure he's not a midget
with a learning disability?

1369
01:10:19,383 --> 01:10:22,428
He is seven years old, Ron.

1370
01:10:22,636 --> 01:10:24,138
- All right.
<i>- Now listen to me.</i>

1371
01:10:24,304 --> 01:10:29,268
He has a science fair tomorrow, at 8:00,
and he wants you to be there.

1372
01:10:29,393 --> 01:10:31,979
I will be there. All right?

1373
01:10:32,146 --> 01:10:33,397
Now, who do you have
for sweeps week?

1374
01:10:33,689 --> 01:10:35,899
I'm not discussing work with you,
Ron, okay?

1375
01:10:35,983 --> 01:10:38,610
Just be there
at the science fair tomorrow.

1376
01:10:38,694 --> 01:10:39,695
Fine!

1377
01:10:40,821 --> 01:10:42,823
<i>Well, they're calling it
the interview of the decade.</i>

1378
01:10:42,906 --> 01:10:45,367
<i>Veronica Corningstone
will sit down with Yasser Arafat.</i>

1379
01:10:45,784 --> 01:10:46,744
Yasser who?

1380
01:10:46,827 --> 01:10:49,413
<i>The head of the PLO and some say
the key to peace in the Middle East.</i>

1381
01:10:49,538 --> 01:10:53,083
<i>Of course, Ms. Corningstone
is the ex-wife of Ron Burgundy,</i>

1382
01:10:53,625 --> 01:10:55,961
<i>so you know that's got to be
a little stinger for Ronny.</i>

1383
01:10:56,044 --> 01:10:57,671
Pay him no mind, Ron.

1384
01:10:57,755 --> 01:11:00,674
<i>Thank you for watching GNN.
I'm Jack Lame.</i>

1385
01:11:02,009 --> 01:11:03,761
Tony Danza's scrotum!

1386
01:11:03,844 --> 01:11:07,347
We're going to get crushed in ratings.
Just crushed.

1387
01:11:07,723 --> 01:11:09,933
I really thought
we had a chance this time.

1388
01:11:10,350 --> 01:11:12,644
What about my
"Death From Above" story?

1389
01:11:13,771 --> 01:11:16,440
You better ask Ron about that.

1390
01:11:17,399 --> 01:11:18,817
We're pulling that story, Brian.

1391
01:11:18,942 --> 01:11:21,779
What? Why?
I worked hard on that story.

1392
01:11:21,862 --> 01:11:25,282
It was my call, all right, Brian?
Just let it go. It's synergy.

1393
01:11:25,365 --> 01:11:26,450
What does that mean?

1394
01:11:26,533 --> 01:11:28,118
Take it easy, Ron.

1395
01:11:28,202 --> 01:11:29,787
We got further
than anybody thought we would.

1396
01:11:29,870 --> 01:11:30,871
We'll get 'em next time.

1397
01:11:30,954 --> 01:11:34,041
You take it easy!
I'm not in this to finish second!

1398
01:11:34,166 --> 01:11:35,751
I think Champ is just saying...

1399
01:11:35,834 --> 01:11:39,129
I know what he was trying to say,
Brian, okay?

1400
01:11:39,213 --> 01:11:41,965
And it doesn't surprise me
that you guys don't care.

1401
01:11:42,049 --> 01:11:44,676
Let's face it,
I'm the one who gets the ratings.

1402
01:11:45,469 --> 01:11:47,805
I'm starting to wonder
what you clowns actually do.

1403
01:11:48,555 --> 01:11:51,517
Chani likes clowns.
Except for the scary ones.

1404
01:11:51,642 --> 01:11:52,726
Shut up, Brick!

1405
01:11:53,227 --> 01:11:55,229
Just shut up for once!

1406
01:11:55,979 --> 01:11:59,149
Ron yelled at me.

1407
01:11:59,233 --> 01:12:00,526
You're damn right I yelled at you!

1408
01:12:04,488 --> 01:12:06,406
You don't yell at Brick.

1409
01:12:06,824 --> 01:12:08,325
Are you still smoking crack?

1410
01:12:08,742 --> 01:12:10,077
No.

1411
01:12:10,577 --> 01:12:12,704
I only smoked that one time.

1412
01:12:13,163 --> 01:12:16,416
That's a lie. I've done it six more times.

1413
01:12:16,583 --> 01:12:17,918
You made Brick cry.

1414
01:12:19,586 --> 01:12:22,005
You've gone ratings crazy, Ron.

1415
01:12:22,089 --> 01:12:23,257
You know what, Ron?

1416
01:12:23,882 --> 01:12:26,134
We're a news team,
and that's a bond for life.

1417
01:12:26,260 --> 01:12:28,053
But I don't like the man you've become.

1418
01:12:28,136 --> 01:12:29,930
We were happy when you found us.

1419
01:12:30,013 --> 01:12:31,640
I was photographing kittens,

1420
01:12:31,723 --> 01:12:34,893
Champ was serving bats to people,
and Brick was dead.

1421
01:12:34,977 --> 01:12:36,687
We took a chance
and followed you here.

1422
01:12:36,770 --> 01:12:39,189
But you know what? I'm starting to
realize, it was all about you,

1423
01:12:39,273 --> 01:12:41,692
and beating Veronica
no matter what the cost.

1424
01:12:41,775 --> 01:12:44,820
It wasn't about news.
It wasn't about the team.

1425
01:12:44,903 --> 01:12:46,405
It definitely wasn't about your son.

1426
01:12:46,488 --> 01:12:47,489
Yeah!

1427
01:12:47,698 --> 01:12:50,117
You'll have to excuse me, Brian.

1428
01:12:50,742 --> 01:12:56,373
I've got a sore back from carrying
your ass around for the last 15 years.

1429
01:12:57,416 --> 01:12:58,792
You know what, Burgundy?

1430
01:12:59,209 --> 01:13:02,212
I think your mouth
is writing checks that your body isn't...

1431
01:13:02,296 --> 01:13:04,464
Can't even... Do anything with.

1432
01:13:10,846 --> 01:13:13,640
Fine, go! I don't need you!

1433
01:13:14,266 --> 01:13:16,476
I'll do the news by myself!

1434
01:13:21,273 --> 01:13:24,151
<i>Tonight I interview Yasser Arafat...</i>

1435
01:13:24,234 --> 01:13:25,819
<i>- This is terrible.
-...the secretive head of the PLO.</i>

1436
01:13:26,945 --> 01:13:29,031
- We're on in 20, Ron, 20.
- All right.

1437
01:13:29,781 --> 01:13:30,782
You ready?

1438
01:13:31,366 --> 01:13:32,910
What's that?

1439
01:13:33,243 --> 01:13:34,369
That's nothing.

1440
01:13:34,453 --> 01:13:37,915
It's just a car chase
on the satellite feed from Milwaukee.

1441
01:13:38,999 --> 01:13:40,459
You know what?

1442
01:13:40,834 --> 01:13:43,295
Give it to me live to start the broadcast.

1443
01:13:43,378 --> 01:13:45,881
No. That's not news, Ron.

1444
01:13:46,089 --> 01:13:47,966
Give it to me live, okay?

1445
01:13:48,050 --> 01:13:49,593
And don't question me again.

1446
01:13:49,676 --> 01:13:50,636
Bill!

1447
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:53,096
<i>- Now to you, the modern viewer...
- Here we go.</i>

1448
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:55,724
<i>...reporting on a car chase
may seem commonplace...</i>

1449
01:13:55,807 --> 01:13:59,186
<i>- Three, two...
-...but in 1980, it was unheard of.</i>

1450
01:13:59,269 --> 01:14:03,315
Good evening. I'm Ron Burgundy,
reporting live from New York.

1451
01:14:03,398 --> 01:14:06,944
We have breaking news
developing in our nation's heartland.

1452
01:14:07,027 --> 01:14:10,656
A high-speed car chase is in progress...

1453
01:14:10,739 --> 01:14:13,325
Keep the "Breaking News" logo.
Keep up the graphics.

1454
01:14:13,408 --> 01:14:14,409
Reaching speeds of 100 miles per hour.

1455
01:14:14,493 --> 01:14:18,330
And for the first time in news history,
we will stay with it live

1456
01:14:18,413 --> 01:14:22,000
<i>until it resolves in either
a huge accident or a massive shootout.</i>

1457
01:14:22,084 --> 01:14:23,085
Richard!

1458
01:14:23,168 --> 01:14:26,171
Hurry. Get in here!
There's a car chase on the news!

1459
01:14:27,297 --> 01:14:29,341
When is Dad gonna be here?

1460
01:14:29,424 --> 01:14:30,676
He'll be here.

1461
01:14:31,134 --> 01:14:32,260
Are you a little upset?

1462
01:14:32,344 --> 01:14:37,557
Do you want to do that thing where
we sort of talk about our feelings?

1463
01:14:37,724 --> 01:14:39,726
- Oh, God, no.
- Okay.

1464
01:14:39,893 --> 01:14:43,772
This is the pulse of what's going on
in our country right now.

1465
01:14:44,064 --> 01:14:45,315
Freddie, what's going on?

1466
01:14:45,399 --> 01:14:47,442
Why is there
a local car chase on the TV?

1467
01:14:47,526 --> 01:14:49,069
It's Burgundy. He insisted!

1468
01:14:49,194 --> 01:14:50,988
Can't you see what
the son of a bitch is doing?

1469
01:14:51,071 --> 01:14:52,698
We didn't have a story, so he made one.

1470
01:14:52,781 --> 01:14:54,241
You can't do that!

1471
01:14:54,533 --> 01:14:56,410
Tell Ron to speculate
who's driving the car.

1472
01:14:56,493 --> 01:14:59,413
Ron, speculate on who's driving the car.

1473
01:14:59,746 --> 01:15:03,542
We believe the driver may be on drugs.

1474
01:15:03,625 --> 01:15:06,169
<i>He's probably 6'7", 6'8".</i>

1475
01:15:06,253 --> 01:15:08,755
But a skinny 6'7", 6'8". About 160.

1476
01:15:08,922 --> 01:15:11,174
He may have a hostage or two.

1477
01:15:11,258 --> 01:15:13,301
We don't know. He could have...

1478
01:15:13,427 --> 01:15:16,263
The phone lines are lighting up.
It's about the chase!

1479
01:15:16,346 --> 01:15:17,764
I've never seen anything like it!

1480
01:15:18,056 --> 01:15:21,226
Mr. Arafat, is there any scenario

1481
01:15:21,309 --> 01:15:23,729
by which peace
could be reached with Israel?

1482
01:15:23,812 --> 01:15:26,106
Peace is what burns in my heart.
I am committed to...

1483
01:15:26,231 --> 01:15:27,232
What was... Excuse me.

1484
01:15:27,899 --> 01:15:29,317
What happened to the...

1485
01:15:29,776 --> 01:15:31,361
The network cut to
another developing story.

1486
01:15:31,445 --> 01:15:33,363
Some kind of crazy car chase.

1487
01:15:33,447 --> 01:15:35,449
Who covers a car chase?

1488
01:15:35,615 --> 01:15:39,453
I am sitting here with the most important
interview of my entire career,

1489
01:15:39,536 --> 01:15:40,954
and they're cutting to a car chase?

1490
01:15:41,329 --> 01:15:42,831
I would like to watch the car chase.

1491
01:15:42,914 --> 01:15:44,166
You need to shut your mouth.

1492
01:15:44,249 --> 01:15:45,542
<i>This is extremely gripping.</i>

1493
01:15:45,625 --> 01:15:48,295
<i>He just hit a car! He just hit a car!</i>

1494
01:15:48,378 --> 01:15:49,588
He hit a car! Did you see that?

1495
01:15:49,671 --> 01:15:50,672
He hit a car!

1496
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:53,300
- He hit the car!
- He hit the car!

1497
01:15:53,383 --> 01:15:55,427
When did the news get awesome?

1498
01:15:56,303 --> 01:15:58,263
<i>And he just loses it!</i>

1499
01:15:58,346 --> 01:16:01,308
That's exactly what we needed.
It was getting a little boring...

1500
01:16:04,811 --> 01:16:07,147
Hey. You did a great job.

1501
01:16:07,272 --> 01:16:09,149
Thanks, Gary.

1502
01:16:09,316 --> 01:16:10,776
I don't think your dad's coming.

1503
01:16:10,859 --> 01:16:12,778
I'm sorry, honey,
but I think we need to go.

1504
01:16:14,362 --> 01:16:16,490
Stop reading my mind!

1505
01:16:17,157 --> 01:16:18,366
All right.

1506
01:16:22,537 --> 01:16:24,539
I mean, this is what I worry about.

1507
01:16:26,249 --> 01:16:29,544
- Did you do that with your mind?
- No.

1508
01:16:29,628 --> 01:16:30,796
Liar.

1509
01:16:30,962 --> 01:16:35,008
We're just getting word that police
have finally apprehended the suspect.

1510
01:16:35,509 --> 01:16:40,180
It turns out that he is
an elderly gentleman, he's 80 years old,

1511
01:16:40,305 --> 01:16:42,224
-and he was simply confused.
- Unbelievable.

1512
01:16:42,390 --> 01:16:43,683
I'm Ron Burgundy.

1513
01:16:44,059 --> 01:16:48,271
Don't just have a great night,
have an American night.

1514
01:16:50,065 --> 01:16:51,858
And we are clear!

1515
01:16:52,150 --> 01:16:53,151
Yes!

1516
01:16:53,693 --> 01:16:54,694
Great!

1517
01:16:54,820 --> 01:16:55,946
All right!

1518
01:16:56,238 --> 01:16:58,198
I don't believe it! You did it, Ron!

1519
01:16:58,323 --> 01:17:00,575
Oh, my goodness. Thanks, Freddie.

1520
01:17:01,701 --> 01:17:03,286
I don't deserve this.

1521
01:17:03,453 --> 01:17:05,497
It was a team effort. it really was.

Well, Ron...

1548
01:19:34,437 --> 01:19:36,940
it looks as if both optic nerves

are separated from
their respective corneas.

1566
01:20:23,403 --> 01:20:24,988
<i>Always lonely</i>

1567
01:20:26,698 --> 01:20:29,075
<i>Always looking</i>

1568
01:20:30,702 --> 01:20:35,415
<i>To get even with the men
who did him wrong</i>

1569
01:20:37,917 --> 01:20:39,878
<i>That was Billy</i>

1570
01:20:41,755 --> 01:20:42,756
Who is it?

1571
01:20:45,633 --> 01:20:47,510
Ron, it's us!

1572
01:20:47,594 --> 01:20:50,889
I'm sure you gentlemen
are famished from your travels.

1573
01:20:50,972 --> 01:20:54,642
I hope you like Triscuits
and some pimento loaf.

1574
01:20:54,934 --> 01:20:57,020
Still hot off the griddle!

1575
01:20:57,354 --> 01:20:58,521
There we go.

1576
01:20:59,064 --> 01:21:01,316
Well, everyone at the station
really misses you, Ron.

1577
01:21:02,150 --> 01:21:04,736
Jack Lime's been filling in for you
since you've been gone.

1578
01:21:05,236 --> 01:21:07,364
You know, he's really not
such a bad guy after all.

1579
01:21:08,740 --> 01:21:10,533
He goes by Jack Lamé now.

1580
01:21:10,617 --> 01:21:12,494
Well, he shouldn't be doing that.

1581
01:21:12,577 --> 01:21:14,204
He should be going by Jack Lame.

1582
01:21:14,621 --> 01:21:15,663
Brick!

1583
01:21:15,747 --> 01:21:16,790
Brick.

1584
01:21:17,082 --> 01:21:19,167
That's checkers and caulk.
Don't eat that.

1585
01:21:20,335 --> 01:21:22,045
What about Linda? She hasn't called.

1586
01:21:22,128 --> 01:21:23,421
Linda's pretty busy.

1587
01:21:23,838 --> 01:21:26,132
Ron, I'm going to need your recipe.

1588
01:21:26,299 --> 01:21:27,926
So, Ron, what do you do
with yourself all day?

1589
01:21:28,009 --> 01:21:29,803
You're just out here pretty
much away from everything.

1590
01:21:29,886 --> 01:21:32,013
Well, every day begins about the same.

1591
01:21:32,472 --> 01:21:34,557
I wake up screaming in terror

1592
01:21:34,641 --> 01:21:36,559
because of the blackness
and I think I'm dead.

1593
01:21:36,643 --> 01:21:37,685
Every day?

1594
01:21:37,811 --> 01:21:39,479
Yes! Every day!

1595
01:21:39,604 --> 01:21:42,774
And then I begin what's called
The Great Adventure.

1596
01:21:42,941 --> 01:21:44,609
Making breakfast.

1597
01:21:44,818 --> 01:21:47,404
I've eaten everything
from nails to drink coasters.

1598
01:21:47,529 --> 01:21:50,115
One time I bit hard
into a marble ashtray,

1599
01:21:50,198 --> 01:21:52,075
thinking it was a savory waffle.

1600
01:21:52,367 --> 01:21:56,704
I wanted that waffle so bad!
Completely shattered my teeth.

1601
01:21:56,788 --> 01:21:59,165
Couldn't you tell
the ashtray wasn't hot like a waffle?

1602
01:21:59,249 --> 01:22:01,668
No! I couldn't! Because I'm blind!

1603
01:22:01,918 --> 01:22:05,755
I'm not blind
23 hours a day or 22 hours a day,

1604
01:22:05,839 --> 01:22:08,800
I'm blind the whole goddamn time!

1605
01:22:08,883 --> 01:22:12,095
Do you have any idea what it's like
to drink a half a bottle of ketchup

1606
01:22:12,178 --> 01:22:15,974
thinking it was a bottle of
1946 Chéteauneuf-du-Pape?

1607
01:22:17,517 --> 01:22:18,643
I even decanted it!

1608
01:22:19,018 --> 01:22:22,147
If you drank half a bottle
of that, that's like...

1609
01:22:22,397 --> 01:22:23,940
That's like nine or 10 gulps.

1610
01:22:24,023 --> 01:22:25,608
I mean, you couldn't tell
that was ketchup?

1611
01:22:25,692 --> 01:22:27,068
Did I stutter?

1612
01:22:27,152 --> 01:22:30,155
I'm ba-lind!

1613
01:22:30,238 --> 01:22:32,031
You're having a tough time, Ron, I know.

1614
01:22:32,282 --> 01:22:33,992
You know what the biggest indignity is?

1615
01:22:34,701 --> 01:22:36,202
I can't even masturbate!

1616
01:22:36,286 --> 01:22:39,372
- Why?
- Heck, one morning, I spent 20 minutes

1617
01:22:39,456 --> 01:22:44,210
aggressively rubbing my shin,
wondering, "Where's the sensation?

1618
01:22:44,294 --> 01:22:45,420
"Where's the pleasure coming?"

1619
01:22:45,503 --> 01:22:46,880
How is that even possible?

1620
01:22:46,963 --> 01:22:49,466
It's connected to you.
It's in the same place.

1621
01:22:49,549 --> 01:22:51,384
- I know you think I'm stupid, don't you?
- No!

1622
01:22:51,801 --> 01:22:54,137
The weirdo who lives
in the weird lighthouse

1623
01:22:54,220 --> 01:22:55,472
in the middle of nowhere.

1624
01:22:55,555 --> 01:22:57,891
Ron, it was your choice to
live in a "weird lighthouse."

1625
01:22:57,974 --> 01:22:59,267
You know why I live here?

1626
01:22:59,559 --> 01:23:03,396
Let me say it real slow and real loud.

1627
01:23:04,189 --> 01:23:05,982
I'm

1628
01:23:06,065 --> 01:23:08,735
blind!

1629
01:23:09,736 --> 01:23:11,279
I guess we should get out of here.

1630
01:23:11,362 --> 01:23:12,780
Maybe you should go. Yes.

1631
01:23:13,198 --> 01:23:14,824
Why don't you guys get out of here!

1632
01:23:15,325 --> 01:23:17,827
Despite my complete and utter isolation,

1633
01:23:17,911 --> 01:23:21,039
your gentlemen's visit
has actually made it worse!

1634
01:23:28,713 --> 01:23:30,131
Goodbye, Ron.

1635
01:23:32,383 --> 01:23:33,384
What?

1636
01:23:34,344 --> 01:23:35,428
No, don't go!

1637
01:23:35,845 --> 01:23:39,974
Please! Wait! I'm all alone! Come back!

1638
01:23:44,938 --> 01:23:47,482
Wait! Come back!

1639
01:23:48,399 --> 01:23:50,109
Come back!

1640
01:23:53,363 --> 01:23:54,906
I'm alone!

1641
01:23:55,782 --> 01:23:59,577
Why have you
done this to me, God? Why?

1642
01:24:00,328 --> 01:24:04,040
Couldn't you have cured a sick
child or created a new animal?

1643
01:24:04,290 --> 01:24:08,127
But, no, you had to
make Ron Burgundy blind!

1644
01:24:09,379 --> 01:24:10,797
Well, I never thought that I would see

1645
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:14,384
the Ron Burgundy
full of so much self-pity.

1646
01:24:14,467 --> 01:24:17,262
Who is it? What is that noise?

1647
01:24:17,595 --> 01:24:18,596
Take my hand.

1648
01:24:19,305 --> 01:24:20,640
I can't see it!

1649
01:24:20,723 --> 01:24:21,933
Reach for it, Ron!

1650
01:24:22,433 --> 01:24:24,686
You have to learn to do for yourself now.

1651
01:24:25,562 --> 01:24:27,397
All right. This... Okay. Here we go.

1652
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:28,773
Get up. There we go.

1653
01:24:31,484 --> 01:24:32,860
Cher, is that you?

1654
01:24:32,986 --> 01:24:34,737
You can't recognize me by my voice?

1655
01:24:35,321 --> 01:24:36,864
Jan-Michael Vincent?

1656
01:24:37,282 --> 01:24:38,283
Really?

1657
01:24:38,700 --> 01:24:41,202
Every news station
is copying what you did, Ron.

1658
01:24:41,286 --> 01:24:46,499
All the stories are about animals,
or car chases or strip clubs.

1659
01:24:46,791 --> 01:24:49,168
The genie has been let out of the bottle,

1660
01:24:49,669 --> 01:24:51,921
and old Ron Burgundy popped the cork.

1661
01:24:52,046 --> 01:24:54,591
- That's why I quit WBC <i>News.</i>
- What?

1662
01:24:54,716 --> 01:24:56,968
There's no real news
being reported out there.

1663
01:24:57,051 --> 01:24:58,386
It's just all about ratings.

1664
01:24:58,678 --> 01:25:00,013
Veronica.

1665
01:25:00,555 --> 01:25:01,848
Why are you here?

1666
01:25:01,973 --> 01:25:03,683
I'm here for our son, Ron.

1667
01:25:04,017 --> 01:25:05,435
Walter needs you.

1668
01:25:05,518 --> 01:25:09,397
I need you to start taking responsibility
for him and for yourself.

1669
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:11,357
Do you realize you're talking to a man

1670
01:25:11,441 --> 01:25:15,278
who just this morning tried
to brush his teeth with a live lobster?

1671
01:25:15,486 --> 01:25:16,654
What?

1672
01:25:17,822 --> 01:25:19,699
You would've
known the second that you touched it...

1673
01:25:19,782 --> 01:25:22,744
I'm just saying it's not
going to be a cakewalk.

1674
01:25:23,161 --> 01:25:25,496
Well, then we best get to it.

1675
01:25:26,039 --> 01:25:27,206
Now, drink your tea.

1676
01:25:31,502 --> 01:25:35,048
- Let me get a sponge. I'll get it.
- All right. No, no, just stay there.

1677
01:25:35,214 --> 01:25:37,175
I'll have it cleaned up in a jiffy.

1678
01:25:47,769 --> 01:25:48,978
Let's try this again.

1679
01:25:49,062 --> 01:25:50,647
- Did you throw it?
- Yes, I threw it.

1680
01:25:50,897 --> 01:25:52,523
Just remember the curves.

1681
01:25:52,815 --> 01:25:53,816
The curves.

1682
01:25:53,900 --> 01:25:55,902
- The green eyes.
- Green eyes.

1683
01:25:56,110 --> 01:25:58,071
You have to use your other senses now!

1684
01:25:58,363 --> 01:25:59,656
I can't do it!

1685
01:26:01,491 --> 01:26:04,035
Baxter found something on the beach!

1686
01:26:04,827 --> 01:26:06,162
Ron, be careful!

1687
01:26:07,038 --> 01:26:08,039
It's okay!

1688
01:26:08,414 --> 01:26:12,001
- Walter, what is it?
-It's some kind of fish!

1689
01:26:13,461 --> 01:26:14,921
Oh, my goodness!

1690
01:26:15,004 --> 01:26:18,508
If he stays tangled in this net,
he's not going to survive.

1691
01:26:18,633 --> 01:26:20,468
Walter, sweetheart, it's a shark.

1692
01:26:20,802 --> 01:26:25,056
Son, don't you worry,
we won't let this fellow die.

1693
01:26:25,431 --> 01:26:27,266
We'll do it together, Dad.

1694
01:26:31,854 --> 01:26:34,190
That should keep him in
there until he's strong enough

1695
01:26:34,273 --> 01:26:35,900
to swim out to the deep ocean.

1696
01:26:36,275 --> 01:26:37,360
Can I name him?

1697
01:26:37,443 --> 01:26:39,153
Of course you can, son.

1698
01:26:39,487 --> 01:26:42,448
What about Doby?

1699
01:26:43,116 --> 01:26:45,660
Yes. Our little Doby.

1700
01:26:47,286 --> 01:26:50,289
<i>Even though Ron Burgundy
had lost his sight,</i>

1701
01:26:50,373 --> 01:26:52,542
<i>he had never seen so clearly.</i>

1702
01:26:53,084 --> 01:26:54,043
You did it!

1703
01:26:54,127 --> 01:26:58,715
<i>And with every inch Doby grew,
so did Ron's heart.</i>

1704
01:27:09,809 --> 01:27:12,103
It's just a bunch of crazy lines, isn't it?

1705
01:27:12,353 --> 01:27:15,106
No. It's beautiful.

1706
01:27:16,524 --> 01:27:18,192
It's beautiful.

1707
01:27:32,915 --> 01:27:34,584
What about Gary?

1708
01:27:34,667 --> 01:27:36,335
We split up two weeks ago.

1709
01:27:36,544 --> 01:27:39,505
He was too emotionally stable.
It was so annoying!

1710
01:27:39,839 --> 01:27:43,134
<i>And so, just like
the passing of the seasons,</i>

1711
01:27:43,384 --> 01:27:45,428
<i>it came time for Doby to return</i>

1712
01:27:45,511 --> 01:27:47,847
<i>to the deep waters
he was meant to call home.</i>

1713
01:27:48,097 --> 01:27:49,932
I hear his tail splashing!

1714
01:27:50,057 --> 01:27:51,684
He's actually swimming away!

1715
01:27:52,143 --> 01:27:54,270
Is he looking back for us
over his shoulder?

1716
01:27:54,437 --> 01:27:56,147
Sharks don't have shoulders, Ron.

1717
01:27:56,230 --> 01:28:00,193
No, he just swam away,
and he's instantly looking for fish to eat.

1718
01:28:00,693 --> 01:28:02,361
He was my best friend.

1719
01:28:04,030 --> 01:28:05,490
<i>You</i>

1720
01:28:05,782 --> 01:28:08,034
<i>Swam with strength</i>

1721
01:28:09,786 --> 01:28:11,245
<i>You</i>

1722
01:28:11,662 --> 01:28:14,665
<i>Loved with grace</i>

1723
01:28:15,208 --> 01:28:19,086
<i>You touched us all</i>

1724
01:28:19,629 --> 01:28:23,549
<i>With your expressionless face</i>

1725
01:28:27,011 --> 01:28:29,430
<i>Doby, oh, Doby</i>

1726
01:28:29,514 --> 01:28:32,975
<i>May you find many treasures</i>

1727
01:28:33,434 --> 01:28:37,522
<i>Both emotional and monetary</i>

1728
01:28:39,148 --> 01:28:42,318
<i>You were wise and loving</i>

1729
01:28:42,401 --> 01:28:45,613
<i>And never contrary</i>

1730
01:28:45,947 --> 01:28:47,698
<i>Dob)'</i>

1731
01:28:48,032 --> 01:28:50,243
<i>Oh, Doby</i>

1732
01:28:50,827 --> 01:28:53,412
<i>I'll never forget thee</i>

1733
01:28:57,416 --> 01:28:59,126
<i>Dob)'</i>

1734
01:28:59,418 --> 01:29:01,921
<i>Oh, Doby</i>

1735
01:29:02,088 --> 01:29:04,757
<i>I'll never forget thee</i>

1736
01:29:09,095 --> 01:29:11,639
Promise you'll always
be there for me, Dad?

1737
01:29:11,722 --> 01:29:13,099
I promise.

1738
01:29:13,432 --> 01:29:15,268
If I say I'll be there for you,

1739
01:29:15,351 --> 01:29:17,812
there's nothing on God's earth
that will stop me.

1740
01:29:18,062 --> 01:29:19,438
I love you, Dad.

1741
01:29:19,605 --> 01:29:22,024
Let's get back up to
the lighthouse, all right?

1742
01:29:22,149 --> 01:29:23,609
- Come on.
- Okay.

1743
01:29:24,235 --> 01:29:25,444
Let's go.

1744
01:29:26,404 --> 01:29:30,283
I hope you eat lots of fish
and people, Doby.

1745
01:29:36,247 --> 01:29:37,331
There you are.

1746
01:29:37,415 --> 01:29:40,793
I found the most beautiful
clams down by the estuary.

1747
01:29:40,877 --> 01:29:42,920
I thought we could steam
them up tonight

1748
01:29:43,004 --> 01:29:45,214
with a nice butter sauce

1749
01:29:45,590 --> 01:29:47,133
and some wine.

1750
01:29:48,843 --> 01:29:49,927
Veronica.

1751
01:29:50,177 --> 01:29:51,470
Yes, Ron?

1752
01:29:52,305 --> 01:29:53,848
Can you explain this?

1753
01:29:56,851 --> 01:30:00,062
<i>Ron, this is Dr. Brangley.
I've left dozens of messages.</i>

1754
01:30:00,146 --> 01:30:01,898
<i>Somehow, they must be getting erased.</i>

1755
01:30:01,981 --> 01:30:06,152
<i>But there is a procedure
that can possibly return your sight.</i>

1756
01:30:06,527 --> 01:30:09,155
<i>Please get back to me
if you're interested.</i>

1757
01:30:09,488 --> 01:30:12,742
Well? Have you been
erasing these messages?

1758
01:30:12,909 --> 01:30:15,620
Yes. Ron, just let me explain.

1759
01:30:15,703 --> 01:30:16,787
How could you?

1760
01:30:16,871 --> 01:30:19,707
We've never been this happy,
and I just thought that...

1761
01:30:19,790 --> 01:30:21,500
Thought that if I could see again,

1762
01:30:21,584 --> 01:30:23,836
that somehow I couldn't
love you and Walter anymore?

1763
01:30:24,003 --> 01:30:25,004
Yes!

1764
01:30:25,588 --> 01:30:29,634
Damn you, woman! You lied to me!

1765
01:30:30,635 --> 01:30:32,345
I gave you everything!

1766
01:30:32,511 --> 01:30:35,681
I gave you my heart, my smile,

1767
01:30:36,724 --> 01:30:37,975
my seed.

1768
01:30:38,643 --> 01:30:39,894
And you lied to me.

1769
01:30:40,019 --> 01:30:41,395
- Dad!
- Sweetheart.

1770
01:30:41,479 --> 01:30:42,939
No! Dad!

1771
01:30:43,189 --> 01:30:44,941
Don't leave, Dad!

1772
01:30:45,524 --> 01:30:46,901
- Dad!
- Walter, just...

1773
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:48,444
Sweetheart, we have to let him go.

1774
01:30:49,654 --> 01:30:51,364
He needs to go free.

1775
01:30:52,365 --> 01:30:53,824
Just like Doby.

1776
01:30:54,367 --> 01:30:56,661
He'll be back. He promised.

1777
01:30:58,245 --> 01:31:01,582
Could you please call me a damn cab?
I'm blind!

1778
01:31:01,666 --> 01:31:02,667
Of course!

1779
01:31:03,542 --> 01:31:06,462
<i>Ron, the operation was a success.</i>

1780
01:31:06,921 --> 01:31:09,924
But we won't know for sure
until we remove the bandages.

1781
01:31:16,263 --> 01:31:17,598
Well?

1782
01:31:17,890 --> 01:31:19,058
Yes.

1783
01:31:19,725 --> 01:31:20,768
I can see.

1784
01:31:25,022 --> 01:31:28,567
Oh, God, oh, God.
It's Ron Burgundy, everyone!

1785
01:31:28,734 --> 01:31:30,319
You are my inspiration.

1786
01:31:30,444 --> 01:31:32,196
Well, thank you.

1787
01:31:33,447 --> 01:31:34,490
Welcome back, Ron.

1788
01:31:34,740 --> 01:31:36,325
Thanks. Thanks, Bri-man.

1789
01:31:36,826 --> 01:31:38,160
Good luck in Vietnam.

1790
01:31:38,911 --> 01:31:40,246
Brick.

1791
01:31:40,413 --> 01:31:41,664
Brick and I are having a baby!

1792
01:31:41,747 --> 01:31:42,957
We're gonna name him
Tortilla Jackson.

1793
01:31:43,290 --> 01:31:45,042
- All right.
- I'm 22 months pregnant.

1794
01:31:45,126 --> 01:31:46,252
Well, get over here, you bastard.

1795
01:31:46,335 --> 01:31:47,545
Got you a drink, Ron. Come on.

1796
01:31:48,629 --> 01:31:52,299
Hold on to that drink.
I just want to grab some air.

1797
01:32:04,270 --> 01:32:05,771
How you doing there?

1798
01:32:07,940 --> 01:32:10,401
I'm fine. Just...

1799
01:32:11,527 --> 01:32:13,029
Just a lot of people in there.

1800
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:17,283
Listen, Ron,
I'm sorry that I never called or visited.

1801
01:32:17,491 --> 01:32:19,285
There's no need to explain.

1802
01:32:19,702 --> 01:32:20,995
But, listen, I mean, you're back.

1803
01:32:21,078 --> 01:32:22,079
Hello, Ron.

1804
01:32:23,581 --> 01:32:24,749
What are you doing here?

1805
01:32:24,999 --> 01:32:28,044
I had to come tell you
something very important.

1806
01:32:30,046 --> 01:32:31,297
You must be Linda Jackson.

1807
01:32:31,672 --> 01:32:33,049
You must be Veronica.

1808
01:32:33,132 --> 01:32:34,550
Yes, I am. It's a pleasure.

1809
01:32:34,759 --> 01:32:36,427
This is a touching moment for me.

1810
01:32:36,510 --> 01:32:40,931
Please, don't take this the wrong way,
but if you touch Ron again,

1811
01:32:41,015 --> 01:32:43,476
I will shoot you
in the cooter with a B.B. gun.

1812
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:46,020
You can talk big all you want,

1813
01:32:46,103 --> 01:32:48,522
but guess what,
this kitten's got claws, bitch.

1814
01:32:49,065 --> 01:32:50,149
Don't mess with me, Linda,

1815
01:32:50,483 --> 01:32:53,611
because this "White Thunder" rolls
deep and it rolls nasty.

1816
01:32:53,819 --> 01:32:55,362
I was feeling a little bit down,

1817
01:32:55,446 --> 01:32:57,573
but this is definitely
picking up my mood.

1818
01:32:57,698 --> 01:32:59,825
Well, I guess I'll leave you two alone.

1819
01:32:59,909 --> 01:33:02,912
And it's been
an absolute pleasure, Ms. Corningstone.

1820
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:04,121
This has been great.

1821
01:33:04,205 --> 01:33:05,998
Do you guys want to kiss real quick?

1822
01:33:06,082 --> 01:33:07,958
Ron. Read the room.

1823
01:33:08,250 --> 01:33:09,668
I'll take that as a no.

1824
01:33:10,377 --> 01:33:12,129
Bye, Linda.

1825
01:33:12,671 --> 01:33:14,757
I know why you haven't
been returning my messages.

1826
01:33:14,882 --> 01:33:19,053
I wasn't calling for me, I was calling
because Walter has a piano recital

1827
01:33:19,136 --> 01:33:21,931
in half an hour
at the Tishman School on 65th Street.

1828
01:33:22,014 --> 01:33:24,517
And he wrote a piece for you, Ron.

1829
01:33:25,476 --> 01:33:26,519
Walter.

1830
01:33:26,602 --> 01:33:29,522
It would mean the absolute
world to him to have you there.

1831
01:33:29,605 --> 01:33:32,858
Ron, I just got a call
from the control room! Big fan.

1832
01:33:33,734 --> 01:33:37,113
Actress Sheila Blackledge,
the mom from the hit sitcom

1833
01:33:37,196 --> 01:33:39,240
<i>Four's a Family, Five's a Crowd,</i>

1834
01:33:39,365 --> 01:33:41,826
she just found out
her husband cheated on her

1835
01:33:41,909 --> 01:33:44,745
and she severed his penis
while he slept!

1836
01:33:44,870 --> 01:33:45,913
Oh, my goodness.

1837
01:33:46,038 --> 01:33:49,667
The police arrived.
She fled in her white Bronco,

1838
01:33:49,750 --> 01:33:53,295
and now they're engaged
in a high-speed car chase!

1839
01:33:53,379 --> 01:33:55,506
We've got an exclusive on the live feed,

1840
01:33:55,589 --> 01:33:57,550
but we've got to go, right now!

1841
01:33:57,675 --> 01:34:00,886
Ron, this can be your comeback.

1842
01:34:01,220 --> 01:34:03,472
- Veronica, I...
- No, Ron. No.

1843
01:34:04,390 --> 01:34:06,267
That will get sky-high ratings.

1844
01:34:06,851 --> 01:34:09,854
- Walter will understand.
- Walter will understand.

1845
01:34:10,396 --> 01:34:11,480
Go.

1846
01:34:12,231 --> 01:34:13,774
Come on, Ron. Priorities!

1847
01:34:13,941 --> 01:34:15,776
- Veronica!
- Come on!

1848
01:34:17,903 --> 01:34:19,655
- Can you hear me?
- Yes, yes.

1849
01:34:19,738 --> 01:34:20,990
You're coming in loud and clear.

1850
01:34:21,073 --> 01:34:22,533
You're back and you get this story.

1851
01:34:22,616 --> 01:34:24,493
- This is gonna be huge.
- Right.

1852
01:34:24,577 --> 01:34:26,328
So, is it good to be back home?

1853
01:34:26,412 --> 01:34:27,788
Yeah, I feel good.

1854
01:34:27,872 --> 01:34:30,416
<i>God, look at him.
Like a beacon in the night!</i>

1855
01:34:31,083 --> 01:34:32,418
My golden goose.

1856
01:34:32,501 --> 01:34:33,586
<i>All right, baby.</i>

1857
01:34:33,711 --> 01:34:35,296
So I'm just gonna be
giving you the details.

1858
01:34:35,421 --> 01:34:36,797
Five, four,

1859
01:34:36,881 --> 01:34:38,132
three, two...

1860
01:34:39,717 --> 01:34:40,759
Good evening, America.

1861
01:34:40,843 --> 01:34:45,014
After some time off,
it's good to be back with you.

1862
01:34:45,097 --> 01:34:46,682
I'm Ron Burgundy.

1863
01:34:46,765 --> 01:34:50,102
We have a story tonight
involving an affair,

1864
01:34:50,186 --> 01:34:54,648
a cut-off penis,
a TV star and a car chase.

1865
01:34:54,732 --> 01:34:56,066
And throw it to the feed.

1866
01:34:58,235 --> 01:34:59,653
The only problem is...

1867
01:35:01,197 --> 01:35:03,073
- What's he doing?
- Ron, are you okay?

1868
01:35:03,782 --> 01:35:05,201
- It's not news.
- What?

1869
01:35:05,284 --> 01:35:06,493
Turn off the prompter.

1870
01:35:06,619 --> 01:35:07,620
<i>Ron, this is Kench.</i>

1871
01:35:07,703 --> 01:35:09,038
<i>What the hell do you
think you're doing, mate?</i>

1872
01:35:09,121 --> 01:35:12,791
Just read what's in front of you,
or I will ruin you! Don't!

1873
01:35:12,958 --> 01:35:15,044
Don't!
You leave Kench inside your head!

1874
01:35:16,003 --> 01:35:18,505
- God damn it!
- He took out his earpiece.

1875
01:35:18,631 --> 01:35:21,425
You see, folks,
I've read a lot of news in my day,

1876
01:35:22,801 --> 01:35:26,096
but it's... It's taken me until now

1877
01:35:27,139 --> 01:35:29,516
to realize what real news is.

1878
01:35:29,934 --> 01:35:32,311
Real news is supposed
to let people know

1879
01:35:32,519 --> 01:35:36,815
what the powerful are up to, so that
that power doesn't become corrupt.

1880
01:35:37,149 --> 01:35:39,360
But what happens when
the powerful own the news?

1881
01:35:39,443 --> 01:35:41,695
You piece of shit!

1882
01:35:41,779 --> 01:35:43,656
Shit. He's blowing the whole thing up.

1883
01:35:43,906 --> 01:35:46,825
Recently, I've been
on a bit of a personal journey.

1884
01:35:47,159 --> 01:35:50,996
I made love to a proud,
intelligent black woman.

1885
01:35:52,539 --> 01:35:54,083
I became blind.

1886
01:35:54,625 --> 01:35:57,002
I bottle-fed and raised a shark.

1887
01:35:57,419 --> 01:36:00,047
And I smoked a fair amount of crack.

1888
01:36:00,464 --> 01:36:04,927
But the most important thing I've learned
is that there was an emptiness left

1889
01:36:05,511 --> 01:36:09,265
after turning my back on three of the
best friends anyone could ever ask for.

1890
01:36:09,723 --> 01:36:10,933
Hi, Ron!

1891
01:36:11,016 --> 01:36:12,726
So, if you'll excuse me,

1892
01:36:12,810 --> 01:36:15,020
I'm going to see my child's recital

1893
01:36:15,104 --> 01:36:18,941
and tell the woman I love
that I still love her.

1894
01:36:20,234 --> 01:36:23,028
Good night, America, and never forget,

1895
01:36:24,280 --> 01:36:25,531
you deserve the truth.

1896
01:36:29,702 --> 01:36:31,161
Good. He's dead, done.

1897
01:36:31,245 --> 01:36:33,455
Linda, get the skirt in,
the blonde. Anyone!

1898
01:36:33,539 --> 01:36:35,124
He's coming back!

1899
01:36:35,207 --> 01:36:36,917
Also, one other thing.

1900
01:36:37,001 --> 01:36:39,962
Koala Airlines is a really shitty airline.

1901
01:36:40,212 --> 01:36:43,257
You son of a bitch! You son of a bitch!

1902
01:36:47,678 --> 01:36:48,679
Guys, I'm sorry.

1903
01:36:49,096 --> 01:36:52,224
For a while there, I don't know
what became of Ron Burgundy.

1904
01:36:52,558 --> 01:36:55,102
Brick, I'm sorry I yelled at you.

1905
01:36:55,978 --> 01:36:57,062
Brian, I...

1906
01:36:57,229 --> 01:36:59,565
No reason why I killed
that story of yours.

1907
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:00,941
It was excellent reporting.

1908
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:04,653
And, Champ, I'm sorry
I said no to all those

1909
01:37:04,737 --> 01:37:08,574
offers for late-night
deep-tissue rubdowns.

1910
01:37:10,075 --> 01:37:11,744
Ron, you're a good man.

1911
01:37:11,827 --> 01:37:15,164
But you have fallen victim
to your own ego and your own hubris.

1912
01:37:15,664 --> 01:37:19,168
And before others can forgive you,
you must learn to forgive yourself.

1913
01:37:22,546 --> 01:37:23,589
What was that, Brick?

1914
01:37:24,089 --> 01:37:25,799
I'm wearing two pairs of pants.

1915
01:37:27,343 --> 01:37:28,427
Thank you.

1916
01:37:28,510 --> 01:37:30,346
Ron, we're a team.

1917
01:37:31,722 --> 01:37:32,598
We need you.

1918
01:37:32,973 --> 01:37:34,433
Let him go, Champ.

1919
01:37:39,688 --> 01:37:40,939
Ron!

1920
01:37:41,607 --> 01:37:44,485
Long live Ron Burgundy!

1921
01:37:52,993 --> 01:37:55,788
I'm Brick Tamland for GNN <i>News.</i>

1922
01:37:56,497 --> 01:38:00,167
<i>The itsy bitsy spider
went up the water spout.</i>

1923
01:38:00,459 --> 01:38:02,169
You little hack!

1924
01:38:02,544 --> 01:38:04,088
Who the hell do you think you are?

1925
01:38:04,171 --> 01:38:05,464
After everything I've done for you,

1926
01:38:05,547 --> 01:38:07,966
this is how you repay me?
Well, I will crush you!

1927
01:38:10,803 --> 01:38:12,304
Once again, Mr. Burgundy,

1928
01:38:12,388 --> 01:38:15,057
you are the ballsiest
white man I've ever known.

1929
01:38:15,140 --> 01:38:16,725
What the hell?

1930
01:38:17,476 --> 01:38:19,353
One more for old times' sake.

1931
01:38:25,984 --> 01:38:26,985
Thank you.

1932
01:38:27,069 --> 01:38:29,071
Is Dad going to come?

1933
01:38:29,154 --> 01:38:31,031
No, sweetheart, Daddy has to work.

1934
01:38:31,115 --> 01:38:33,283
He's going to come. I know it.

1935
01:38:33,617 --> 01:38:34,827
Taxi!

1936
01:38:35,494 --> 01:38:37,496
Taxi! Taxi!

1937
01:38:37,579 --> 01:38:38,664
Damn it!

1938
01:38:38,956 --> 01:38:42,209
It's so hard for a proud Mexican
to get a taxi in this city!

1939
01:38:43,043 --> 01:38:44,378
I need to see my son!

1940
01:38:44,795 --> 01:38:49,049
And now, to play an original
composition that he wrote for his father,

1941
01:38:49,174 --> 01:38:52,010
here is seven-year-old Walter Burgundy.

1942
01:39:00,686 --> 01:39:03,188
I made a promise!
I made a promise to my son!

1943
01:39:06,859 --> 01:39:07,901
What the hell?

1944
01:39:08,402 --> 01:39:10,028
Well, hello, Ron.

1945
01:39:10,529 --> 01:39:11,697
You out for a jog?

1946
01:39:11,905 --> 01:39:13,240
Jack Lime!

1947
01:39:14,450 --> 01:39:15,701
Where's everyone going?

1948
01:39:15,826 --> 01:39:18,829
Please. I don't have time to talk, okay?
I have to be somewhere.

1949
01:39:19,204 --> 01:39:21,081
Well, that's funny.
'Cause I got nowhere to be

1950
01:39:21,748 --> 01:39:23,917
because you pretty much
destroyed my career.

1951
01:39:24,543 --> 01:39:28,213
Do you realize what it did to me,
by making me call myself Jack Lame?

1952
01:39:29,298 --> 01:39:31,175
It was a living hell!

1953
01:39:33,886 --> 01:39:36,722
I'm telling you, you have to let me go!

1954
01:39:37,014 --> 01:39:38,891
Don't worry. Four against one.

1955
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:41,018
This will be over fast.

1956
01:39:41,810 --> 01:39:43,479
Maybe not so fast!

1957
01:39:46,982 --> 01:39:49,193
My news team. Thank God!

1958
01:39:51,069 --> 01:39:55,574
Ain't a day that will be or has been
that we don't have Ron Burgundy's back.

1959
01:39:55,782 --> 01:39:57,743
Not a problem.
When I'm done with these mutts,

1960
01:39:57,826 --> 01:39:59,286
I'm gonna wipe my shoes on the curb.

1961
01:39:59,411 --> 01:40:01,121
Oh, yeah, Jack Lime?

1962
01:40:01,497 --> 01:40:02,998
When I'm done with you,

1963
01:40:03,081 --> 01:40:05,876
my mom's going to
pick me up and take me home.

1964
01:40:06,251 --> 01:40:07,419
Wait!

1965
01:40:10,923 --> 01:40:12,716
Here's a headline for you.

1966
01:40:12,799 --> 01:40:15,260
"Moronic Yank Wankerman

1967
01:40:15,344 --> 01:40:18,931
"Gets a Bloody Good Hiding
From News Reader

1968
01:40:19,014 --> 01:40:20,849
"From a Superior Country."

1969
01:40:21,350 --> 01:40:24,603
For we are the BBC News Service.

1970
01:40:27,022 --> 01:40:28,440
No. Not now.

1971
01:40:28,607 --> 01:40:29,775
Fall back, fall back.

1972
01:40:33,904 --> 01:40:35,030
If y'all are gonna get down,

1973
01:40:35,113 --> 01:40:37,950
then Wesley Jackson and
the MTV News crew want in.

1974
01:40:38,116 --> 01:40:39,618
What's MTV?

1975
01:40:40,369 --> 01:40:41,703
I think it's a venereal disease.

1976
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:43,872
The most requested video of the day?

1977
01:40:43,956 --> 01:40:47,042
A new band called
Burgundy's Sucking Chest Wound.

1978
01:40:53,298 --> 01:40:55,175
It wouldn't be a battle
without Jill Janson.

1979
01:40:55,259 --> 01:40:57,636
<i>And</i> Wendy <i>Van</i> Peele
<i>from Entertainment News.</i>

1980
01:40:57,719 --> 01:40:59,972
Entertainment news is an abomination!

1981
01:41:00,222 --> 01:41:02,808
Who are you wearing today?
Look, it's your own blood!

1982
01:41:03,141 --> 01:41:04,810
Today's celebrity birthdays... None.

1983
01:41:04,977 --> 01:41:06,270
Today's celebrity deaths...

1984
01:41:06,353 --> 01:41:08,522
All you trick-ass bitches.

1985
01:41:10,065 --> 01:41:11,400
Hey!

1986
01:41:12,150 --> 01:41:15,279
There's not gonna
be any fight without Scott Riles

1987
01:41:15,487 --> 01:41:17,990
and the incredibly polite
Canadian News team.

1988
01:41:19,658 --> 01:41:22,327
What about
the French-speaking Quebec News?

1989
01:41:22,452 --> 01:41:23,954
The real voice of Canada!

1990
01:41:24,037 --> 01:41:25,038
Give it a rest, eh?

1991
01:41:25,122 --> 01:41:27,666
Give me a break! They can't have news.

1992
01:41:27,833 --> 01:41:29,167
Nothing happens in Canada!

1993
01:41:29,334 --> 01:41:30,836
We're gonna mop the floor with you!

1994
01:41:30,919 --> 01:41:32,129
We're gonna put the boots to you!

1995
01:41:32,212 --> 01:41:33,255
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

1996
01:41:33,338 --> 01:41:36,758
We're gonna gouge your eyes out!
And kick your head in!

1997
01:41:36,842 --> 01:41:38,176
- Sorry!
- Sorry!

1998
01:41:38,260 --> 01:41:39,845
I like your ginger ale!

1999
01:41:43,724 --> 01:41:46,268
Jeff Bullington, ESPN, all sports.

2000
01:41:46,351 --> 01:41:48,604
Tonight's play of the day is me,

2001
01:41:48,687 --> 01:41:50,689
extracting your spine
from your dead body.

2002
01:41:50,856 --> 01:41:52,774
Holy shit, there's a lot of news!

2003
01:41:52,941 --> 01:41:55,193
It's true, the market
is becoming saturated.

2004
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:59,031
Hey. The History Network
wants in on this. We're news, too.

2005
01:41:59,114 --> 01:42:01,700
Only news told much, much later.

2006
01:42:03,327 --> 01:42:06,663
Wait a minute. Is that the ghost
of Stonewall Jackson with you?

2007
01:42:06,788 --> 01:42:09,666
Yes, it is. And the mighty Minotaur.

2008
01:42:10,751 --> 01:42:12,044
I don't know about this, man.

2009
01:42:12,210 --> 01:42:15,130
The Minotaur isn't even history!
He's mythology!

2010
01:42:16,882 --> 01:42:18,634
Let's not downplay the fact

2011
01:42:18,717 --> 01:42:21,136
that that's the ghost
of Stonewall Jackson!

2012
01:42:21,428 --> 01:42:25,599
May the Lord anoint this
hallowed field of battle.

2013
01:42:25,932 --> 01:42:29,269
You guys got room in this
battle for an old war horse?

2014
01:42:29,394 --> 01:42:31,313
Mack Tannen!
What are you doing here?

2015
01:42:31,396 --> 01:42:32,606
You're too old for this.

2016
01:42:32,814 --> 01:42:35,150
Well, you see, there's the thing.

2017
01:42:35,233 --> 01:42:40,822
When there's an early moon,
I almost feel like a stallion again!

2018
01:42:41,406 --> 01:42:42,908
He's on our side, right, Ron?

2019
01:42:51,166 --> 01:42:52,584
He's a were-hyena!

2020
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:56,129
I'm-a call Michael Jackson.
I got a video idea.

2021
01:42:56,421 --> 01:42:58,382
All right, everyone, listen up!

2022
01:43:02,177 --> 01:43:06,932
By virtue of being on this battlefield,
there is no return.

2023
01:43:08,433 --> 01:43:09,935
People will die.

2024
01:43:10,310 --> 01:43:11,561
I'm so horny right now.

2025
01:43:11,645 --> 01:43:13,397
Some will be disfigured.

2026
01:43:13,605 --> 01:43:17,776
In some cases,
lasting friendships will be made.

2027
01:43:18,735 --> 01:43:23,031
And as usual,
no touching of the hair and face.

2028
01:43:23,323 --> 01:43:25,534
Come on.
What do we look like, rookies?

2029
01:43:25,617 --> 01:43:26,660
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

2030
01:43:26,868 --> 01:43:28,620
When El Trousias,

2031
01:43:28,829 --> 01:43:31,998
maiden of the clouds,
blows the battle horn,

2032
01:43:32,582 --> 01:43:34,626
let the battle begin!

2033
01:43:34,793 --> 01:43:37,170
I am El Trousias!

2034
01:43:39,131 --> 01:43:41,299
Hear my siren song!

2035
01:43:43,635 --> 01:43:46,513
El Trousias... The Juicies'.

2036
01:43:52,686 --> 01:43:54,146
That means you can start.

2037
01:43:55,605 --> 01:43:57,524
Brick, what the hell is that?

2038
01:43:58,233 --> 01:43:59,568
It's a gun from the future.

2039
01:43:59,985 --> 01:44:01,778
No fair! He's got a gun from the future!

2040
01:44:02,154 --> 01:44:03,947
Where did you get it from?

2041
01:44:19,171 --> 01:44:23,008
In the name of the King,
the Queen and St. George.

2042
01:44:26,011 --> 01:44:27,095
Huzzah!

2043
01:44:59,753 --> 01:45:01,213
Guess you didn't see that coming.

2044
01:45:01,338 --> 01:45:02,923
Twenty degrees right.

2045
01:45:03,799 --> 01:45:04,883
Fill that gap!

2046
01:45:05,050 --> 01:45:08,220
Fall upon your swords!
Life has no meaning!

2047
01:45:11,723 --> 01:45:15,393
There will be a mint julep
waiting on the other side, son.

2048
01:45:16,937 --> 01:45:18,897
Release your soul to me.

2049
01:45:37,415 --> 01:45:38,750
Sorry!

2050
01:45:39,292 --> 01:45:41,044
"Sorry! Sorry!
-Sorry!

2051
01:45:41,503 --> 01:45:43,338
Sex Panther powers activate.

2052
01:46:06,611 --> 01:46:08,446
It's the ghost of Stonewall Jackson!

2053
01:46:08,613 --> 01:46:11,324
Everyone, it's the ghost
of Stonewall Jackson!

2054
01:46:11,825 --> 01:46:13,410
Why do we have to fight?

2055
01:46:14,160 --> 01:46:15,620
There's so much I could learn from you.

2056
01:46:24,170 --> 01:46:26,548
In the name of Margaret Thatcher...

2057
01:46:26,631 --> 01:46:28,550
- No!
- I sentence you to death!

2058
01:46:28,633 --> 01:46:30,260
Please, no!

2059
01:46:34,014 --> 01:46:35,807
What in the name of Dan lssel?

2060
01:46:38,143 --> 01:46:39,144
Gary!

2061
01:46:39,311 --> 01:46:40,645
Yes, Ron.

2062
01:46:41,980 --> 01:46:43,982
You and I never got along.

2063
01:46:44,107 --> 01:46:45,775
But using the power of my mind,

2064
01:46:45,859 --> 01:46:48,528
I was able to see in the future
that you would do good.

2065
01:46:50,447 --> 01:46:51,865
- Now, go.
- I knew it!

2066
01:46:51,948 --> 01:46:53,450
Go to your son's recital.

2067
01:46:53,533 --> 01:46:55,160
I knew you had mind powers!

2068
01:46:55,285 --> 01:46:57,412
And make it the greatest day of your life!

2069
01:46:57,579 --> 01:46:59,748
Almighty, Almighty,
light the fuse on my call.

2070
01:46:59,831 --> 01:47:01,750
Thirty-niner-niner-14, cook these fools.

2071
01:47:01,833 --> 01:47:03,335
I repeat, cook these fools.

2072
01:47:14,596 --> 01:47:16,848
We've got to get out of here.
There's too much news!

2073
01:47:16,932 --> 01:47:18,558
Man, what a rush!

2074
01:47:18,642 --> 01:47:20,018
The monster's my friend!

2075
01:47:20,143 --> 01:47:22,228
Ron, we can still make your kid's recital!

2076
01:47:23,605 --> 01:47:25,357
Hey, Ronny.

2077
01:47:25,607 --> 01:47:28,693
Jack Lime, please,
I just want to get to my son's recital.

2078
01:47:28,777 --> 01:47:30,612
No! That is out of the question!

2079
01:47:30,695 --> 01:47:31,738
We're outnumbered, Ron.

2080
01:47:31,821 --> 01:47:33,490
Foam the runway, I'm coming in hot!

2081
01:47:45,710 --> 01:47:48,964
<i>Old MacDonald had a farm</i>

2082
01:47:49,172 --> 01:47:51,383
And then four guys on bikes showed up.

2083
01:47:51,800 --> 01:47:54,636
Wes Mantooth and the
Channel Nine news team!

2084
01:47:54,928 --> 01:47:56,304
Hey, what the hell
are you guys doing here?

2085
01:47:56,388 --> 01:47:57,722
This is a national news fight.

2086
01:47:58,056 --> 01:47:59,724
You made one mistake today.

2087
01:48:00,517 --> 01:48:02,477
You messed with somebody
from San Diego.

2088
01:48:02,978 --> 01:48:06,064
It's actually pronounced San Diago.

2089
01:48:06,314 --> 01:48:08,817
Hell, Ron and I
may not agree on everything,

2090
01:48:09,734 --> 01:48:10,986
but we share the bond of being

2091
01:48:11,069 --> 01:48:12,821
from the greatest city
in the history of this Earth.

2092
01:48:14,656 --> 01:48:15,949
Well, ain't that cute?

2093
01:48:16,658 --> 01:48:18,243
But you're outnumbered three-to-one.

2094
01:48:18,868 --> 01:48:20,120
Why don't you go back to your mama?

2095
01:48:20,245 --> 01:48:22,288
Don't you use my mom's name in vain.

2096
01:48:23,123 --> 01:48:25,500
Dorothy Mantooth was
a hard-working single woman

2097
01:48:25,583 --> 01:48:27,377
who raised seven children on her own,

2098
01:48:27,460 --> 01:48:29,879
and she remained sexually
active till the day she died.

2099
01:48:30,130 --> 01:48:32,424
She brought pole dancing
into the mainstream.

2100
01:48:33,133 --> 01:48:35,844
Now here's the thing.
While I've been talking,

2101
01:48:35,927 --> 01:48:39,431
my news team has emptied
their gas tanks at your feet.

2102
01:48:42,434 --> 01:48:45,103
I drop this smoke and
every one of you goes "poof."

2103
01:48:45,437 --> 01:48:47,522
Well, you forgot one thing, leatherman.

2104
01:48:47,605 --> 01:48:49,274
You drop that smoke, you die, too.

2105
01:48:53,111 --> 01:48:54,946
With the things I've done in my life,

2106
01:48:55,864 --> 01:48:57,866
I know I'm going to burn in hell.

2107
01:48:58,950 --> 01:49:01,619
So I sure as shit
ain't afraid to burn here on Earth.

2108
01:49:01,953 --> 01:49:03,580
Oh, my goodness!

2109
01:49:03,747 --> 01:49:05,874
That's the most
badass thing I have ever heard.

2110
01:49:06,624 --> 01:49:07,834
All right!

2111
01:49:09,169 --> 01:49:10,295
Looks like this fight's over.

2112
01:49:12,338 --> 01:49:13,590
Let's go, boys.

2113
01:49:14,758 --> 01:49:17,635
Yay! We won! Let's celebrate!

2114
01:49:17,761 --> 01:49:18,970
Sparklers!

2115
01:49:19,054 --> 01:49:21,806
- No, no, no, Brick!
- No!

2116
01:49:45,705 --> 01:49:48,041
- Bravo! Bravo.
- Yeah.

2117
01:49:50,335 --> 01:49:51,377
Dad!

2118
01:49:51,544 --> 01:49:53,880
Son, I fought a Minotaur to be here.

2119
01:49:54,506 --> 01:49:55,840
And I'd do it again.

2120
01:49:56,007 --> 01:49:59,594
Dad! Together we can defeat voodoo!

2121
01:50:00,011 --> 01:50:02,680
<i>Ron had finally
learned how to love his son</i>

2122
01:50:02,764 --> 01:50:05,433
<i>and his wife more than his career.</i>

2123
01:50:06,518 --> 01:50:09,187
<i>And as it turned out,
his walking off the news</i>

2124
01:50:09,646 --> 01:50:12,857
<i>was the highest-rated
TV event of the year.</i>

2125
01:50:13,608 --> 01:50:16,111
<i>He and his news team,
along with Veronica,</i>

2126
01:50:16,194 --> 01:50:18,780
<i>could have any job they wanted.</i>

2127
01:50:19,531 --> 01:50:23,284
<i>But before that, they had one
little thing to take care of.</i>

2128
01:50:25,703 --> 01:50:29,707
And now, before I join this
couple in holy matrimony,

2129
01:50:30,208 --> 01:50:34,629
Brick and Chani ask us to join them
as they exchange their vows.

2130
01:50:35,630 --> 01:50:36,714
My dearest Brick.

2131
01:50:37,132 --> 01:50:38,842
Everything I have is yours.

2132
01:50:39,843 --> 01:50:42,220
My four lawnmowers. My sister.

2133
01:50:43,263 --> 01:50:44,973
My 35 ferrets.

2134
01:50:45,056 --> 01:50:47,267
My massive student loan
and real estate debt.

2135
01:50:47,851 --> 01:50:49,060
It's all yours.

2136
01:50:50,854 --> 01:50:54,232
There's one story
that shows how good a person Chani is.

2137
01:50:55,900 --> 01:50:58,862
We were leaving dinner
at one of our favorite soda machines

2138
01:50:59,404 --> 01:51:01,489
and we saw a man drop his wallet.

2139
01:51:01,948 --> 01:51:03,992
Chani immediately
picked it up and said,

2140
01:51:04,075 --> 01:51:09,080
"We are rich!" Then she bought $200
worth of Slim Jims and magazines.

2141
01:51:09,914 --> 01:51:12,417
She then threw the wallet into a river.

2142
01:51:15,753 --> 01:51:17,589
Wait! Look!

2143
01:51:17,964 --> 01:51:19,799
Walter, Walter, honey!

2144
01:51:20,008 --> 01:51:21,885
Look in the water!

2145
01:51:22,385 --> 01:51:24,512
It's Doby!

2146
01:51:24,637 --> 01:51:25,805
Oh, my God!

2147
01:51:25,930 --> 01:51:28,266
It's Doby! Doby!

2148
01:51:28,683 --> 01:51:31,186
Ron, what are you doing?
He's not your friend!

2149
01:51:31,477 --> 01:51:32,562
Doby!

2150
01:51:33,229 --> 01:51:35,440
Ron! That's a shark!

2151
01:51:35,857 --> 01:51:37,650
He will eat you!

2152
01:51:38,610 --> 01:51:40,945
<i>Old friends</i>

2153
01:51:43,031 --> 01:51:44,490
<i>Old friends</i>

2154
01:51:44,574 --> 01:51:45,950
Doby!

2155
01:51:46,910 --> 01:51:50,955
<i>Sat on their park bench like bookends</i>

2156
01:51:51,664 --> 01:51:52,790
Oh, my God!

2157
01:51:52,957 --> 01:51:54,626
The shark actually recognizes him!

2158
01:51:56,920 --> 01:51:58,546
Nope. He's viciously attacking him.

2159
01:51:59,547 --> 01:52:02,467
Doby! Doby, it's me! Ron!

2160
01:52:02,634 --> 01:52:04,928
<i>If a man dies with love in his heart,</i>

2161
01:52:05,261 --> 01:52:07,138
<i>does he truly die?</i>

2162
01:52:07,305 --> 01:52:08,640
<i>Absolutely!</i>

2163
01:52:08,723 --> 01:52:13,311
<i>But on this day, Ron Burgundy's grapple
with this denizen from the deep</i>

2164
01:52:13,394 --> 01:52:17,148
<i>was halted by 28 pounds
of furry providence.</i>

2165
01:52:21,986 --> 01:52:23,154
I bottle-fed you!

2166
01:52:26,241 --> 01:52:27,325
Baxter!

2167
01:52:34,499 --> 01:52:35,667
Baxter!

2168
01:52:36,459 --> 01:52:39,587
Baxter! Yes!

2169
01:52:42,632 --> 01:52:45,885
I know, I know, I love you, too.

2170
01:52:49,305 --> 01:52:50,640
Come on.

2171
01:58:19,010 --> 01:58:20,469
All right, let's do it.

2172
01:58:22,555 --> 01:58:23,848
You guys think...

2173
01:58:23,931 --> 01:58:25,349
I don't know how to use a computer.

2174
01:58:25,891 --> 01:58:28,686
Hey, fellas.
I just saw Jack Lime out there.

2175
01:58:28,769 --> 01:58:30,980
He's a goddamn iceman.

2176
01:58:31,480 --> 01:58:33,190
Scared the crap out of me.
