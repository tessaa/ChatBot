1
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:46,691
Hello.

2
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:48,757
Hello, sweetie.

3
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,633
Daddy.

4
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:52,966
It's early.

5
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:54,630
Yeah, I know.

6
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:57,267
I just wanted to let you know
I'm sending you something.

7
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,971
Mmm. Does it smell nice?

8
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:01,172
No,

9
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:03,078
but it's sparkly.

10
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,345
Does it have a receipt?

11
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:10,287
I'm sending it
to you from the store.

12
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:13,924
Why don't you just come by?

13
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:15,654
We'll have some breakfast, hmm?

14
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:18,162
Well, it'd be a long trip.

15
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:20,699
I'm in Venice.

16
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:26,136
With your parole officer's
approval, of course.

17
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,470
Well, I like the guy, Stella,
you know that,

18
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,600
but we never really connected.

19
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:33,475
So I think I've paid
my P.O. his last visit.

20
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,173
What are you into, Dad?

21
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:36,374
Don't break my heart.

22
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:38,041
You told me you were through.

23
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:40,881
After this I am, I swear to you.

24
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,384
Is Charlie there?

25
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:46,152
I'm on a cell phone, darling.

26
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,627
I'll call you tomorrow
from a land line.

27
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:50,822
I love you.

28
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,489
Go back to sleep. Bye.

29
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:53,998
D... Dad?

30
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:00,264
I love you, too.

31
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:08,412
I sent it.

32
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:10,039
You're supposed
to do your shopping

33
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:11,344
after we pull off the job.

34
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,577
I feel so optimistic.

35
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:13,914
So?

36
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:15,352
How do you feel?

37
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:16,911
I'm fine.

38
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,218
Fine?

39
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,225
You know what "fine"
stands for, don't you?

40
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:21,885
Yeah, unfortunately.

41
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:23,121
"Freaked out."

42
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:24,220
- "Insecure."
- "Neurotic."

43
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:25,787
- And "Emotional."
- Good.

44
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:28,026
See those columns behind you?

45
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:30,893
What about them?

46
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,234
That's where they used
to string up thieves

47
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:34,238
who felt "fine."

48
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:36,275
Well... after you.

49
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:45,514
For after the haul.

50
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:48,281
Hope I get to fire it up.

51
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:49,946
Still no word
from the garbagemen?

52
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,149
No.

53
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:52,156
If they're no-shows,

54
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:53,624
three months of prep
down the tubes

55
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:55,661
and I dragged you out
of retirement for nothing.

56
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:57,389
Oh, this is fun.
I like this.

57
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:00,057
You've taken over the reins,
all the worries.

58
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,658
Me loosey-goosey,
just along for the ride.

59
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:04,259
I'm glad you're
enjoying yourself, John.

60
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:05,429
Just remember, a police boat

61
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:07,473
can get from the station
to our position in seven.

62
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,440
That means you got
four minutes to work your magic.

63
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:10,737
Now, you told me ten,

64
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,675
and you said I would have five.

65
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:14,474
When?

66
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,413
Do not be messing
with me right now, okay?

67
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,918
- I will kick your ass.
- Oh, yeah?

68
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,249
Come on, take your best shot.

69
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,254
Come on.

70
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,654
What? Uh-oh.

71
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,267
Come on.

72
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,462
Let's go.

73
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:38,936
What is it this time?

74
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,370
Da Vinci. Architect.

75
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,634
Engineer. Painter.

76
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:42,936
Yeah, fascinating.

77
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,135
Hey, look, look. Check this out.

78
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,941
"Learn the language of poetry,
art, romance, sex."

79
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,613
Unlike you, my friend,
I don't need a guidebook.

80
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:52,946
Can we go? Please?

81
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,453
Right, guv'nor.

82
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:56,954
Come along,
make yourself useful.

83
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,217
Untie that line.

84
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,417
Today.

85
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:00,550
Yeah.

86
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:01,615
Yeah, Gilligan.

87
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:02,752
If you don't mind.

88
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,126
- We set?
- Yeah. I've enhanced

89
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:44,431
the viewing matrix to track both
the Cartesian coordinates

90
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:45,903
and three altitude angles,

91
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:47,530
the yaw, pitch and roll
to give us

92
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,165
the exact position and
orientation of our baby.

93
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,209
We're in Italy.

94
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:51,504
Speak English.

95
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,272
Steve, how we looking?

96
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:57,908
Papa took the boat to work at
8:15, so the garage is empty.

97
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:02,318
Mama left with daughter
at 8:30 for preschool as usual.

98
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:04,549
So for the next 45 minutes,

99
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:06,353
we own this place, gentlemen.

100
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,758
Still no word
from the garbagemen?

101
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:10,887
Hey, who got you
the beekeepers in Budapest?

102
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:12,021
They'll be there.

103
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,463
You can trust these guys.

104
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,899
Steve, how many times
do I have to tell you?

105
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:20,404
I trust everyone... I just don't
trust the devil inside them.

106
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:09,588
We're in.

107
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,998
Just tell me where to paint.

108
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,711
Your men are still not
in position?

109
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:40,274
They will be.

110
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,344
Well, you don't know that,
Steve. We should abort.

111
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:46,221
I'm sorry, John, but I think
that's Charlie's call now.

112
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:53,163
Our baby's being taken
out of here tonight.

113
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:54,392
This is our only shot at it.

114
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:59,098
Charlie?

115
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,866
Keep going?

116
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,875
It's up to you, kid.

117
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,875
It's a go.

118
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:10,649
Okay, Steve.

119
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:16,649
From the west wall,
measure 14 feet, eight inches.

120
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:17,882
Got it.

121
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:19,652
Now measure
eight feet, five inches

122
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,283
from the north wall.

123
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,055
That's the northwest corner
of our baby.

124
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,454
Got it.

125
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:26,555
Well, it's right above you.

126
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:00,923
Now, paint.

127
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:04,332
Two feet, nine inches wide.

128
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:06,496
Two feet, five inches deep.

129
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:08,767
Okay, Left Ear.
You're up.

130
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,508
14 feet four inches
from that west wall.

131
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:39,769
Yeah.

132
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:42,940
Bene.

133
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:46,734
The garbagemen
are in position, John.

134
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:51,226
All right, Charlie,
someone just called it in.

135
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:53,965
The police boat's
heading your way.

136
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:55,631
Seven minutes and counting.

137
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,005
Let's go.

138
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:19,655
We got four minutes
to load and leave. Let's go.

139
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,584
Whoa! Whoa!

140
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,872
Hey, you guys. Come here.

141
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:38,316
I want to propose a toast.

142
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,324
To us.

143
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:41,359
Yay!

144
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,324
And I want to propose
a toast to Charlie

145
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:50,800
because we just stole
$35 million worth of gold

146
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:52,769
without even holding a gun

147
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:54,465
because he planned this
down to a "T."

148
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,770
Nobody else
could have done that.

149
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:57,866
Nobody. Charlie!

150
00:17:57,943 --> 00:17:59,672
- Charlie!
- Yay!

151
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,474
Thank you.

152
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:02,775
So, come on, gentlemen.

153
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:04,577
Shopping list.
Who's doing what?

154
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:05,878
Spare no dirty details.

155
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:07,281
Come on, you guys.

156
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:09,547
Take a lesson from an old man.

157
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:11,350
Don't spend it.
Invest.

158
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:14,155
In what?

159
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:16,091
In gold.

160
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,428
Let's figure out

161
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:21,625
how to get out of here first,
all right?

162
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,759
What are you getting, Rob?

163
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:25,133
I don't know...
there's a lot of things

164
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:26,296
you can buy with a lot of money.

165
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:28,100
You know, I'm just thinking
about naked girls

166
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:29,333
in leather seats.

167
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:30,898
Obviously. See?

168
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:33,137
Suppose I get
the Aston Martin Vanquish?

169
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:34,474
There's not a lot
a girl won't do

170
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:36,571
on the passenger seat
of one of those things.

171
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:38,317
I'm going to get a NAD T770

172
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:41,215
digital decoder with a 70-watt
amp and Burr Brown DACs.

173
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,151
Yeah.

174
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:44,314
It's a big stereo.

175
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:46,584
Speakers so loud they blow
women's clothes off.

176
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:47,818
Now you're talking.

177
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:51,919
$35 million... you can't get
more creative than that, man?

178
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:54,157
I'm going to Andalucia,
south of Spain...

179
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:55,700
right there.

180
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:57,325
Get me a big house...

181
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:59,029
get me a library
full of first editions.

182
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:00,401
Get a room for my shoes.

183
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,440
What about you, Steve?

184
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:04,874
I don't know...
I haven't decided yet.

185
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,739
You haven't decided yet?

186
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,677
Come on, man,
is it the mountain air, just...?

187
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:09,679
I liked what you said.

188
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:11,215
I'll take one of each of yours.

189
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:14,510
Well, well, two of everything

190
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:16,019
- For Steve then.
- Two of those.

191
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:17,112
Oy!

192
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:24,190
Loved the toast.

193
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:26,458
But you could've pulled this off
with your eyes closed.

194
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:28,864
No, you were incredible.

195
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:30,367
Just incredible.

196
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:31,868
You saw the whole picture.

197
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:33,199
You covered all the angles.

198
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:36,036
You know, Charlie,

199
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:39,202
there are two kinds of thieves
in this world:

200
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:41,872
the ones who steal
to enrich their lives,

201
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:45,883
and the ones who steal
to define their lives.

202
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:47,885
Don't be the latter.

203
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:50,046
Makes you miss out
on what's really important

204
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:51,885
in this life.

205
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:54,391
What are you talking about,
John?

206
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:55,892
You've been a good father.

207
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:59,556
Sitting in prisons
doesn't make you a good father.

208
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:02,156
I spent half my kid's life
in prison.

209
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:06,170
Don't get to be my age
with nothing but this, Charlie.

210
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:10,231
Find somebody you want to spend
the rest of your life with

211
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:12,368
and hold onto her forever.

212
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:15,470
- Okay?
- Hey.

213
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,572
Let's go...
I'm freezing my ass off.

214
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:19,913
Yeah.

215
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:21,919
Steve's getting cold.

216
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:23,420
You, too?

217
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:24,580
I'm all right.

218
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:27,253
I love you, kid.

219
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:28,725
You did really great.

220
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:31,262
Thanks, John.

221
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:34,731
Let's go.

222
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:46,104
Money

223
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:48,738
It's a gas

224
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:55,982
Grab that cash with both hands
and make a stash

225
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:59,522
New car, caviar,
four-star daydream...

226
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,388
You should've seen Rob
behind the wheel of that boat.

227
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,087
He was like Don Johnson.

228
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:05,186
Oy, yeah, from Brixton.

229
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,357
Yeah, what the hell do you know
about Brixton, eh?

230
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:16,405
Look at this idiot
right in the middle of the road.

231
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:17,999
What's this, what's this?

232
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:22,981
Who the hell are these guys?

233
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:27,444
Hey!

234
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:28,611
Take your hands off the wheel.

235
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:29,346
Steve!

236
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:34,658
Don't even think about it...
just do it.

237
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:40,896
No, no, no, no,

238
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,160
- No, no, no, no, John.
- Steve,

239
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:43,166
what the hell are you doing?

240
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:44,600
Made a few plans of my own.

241
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:50,273
There's nowhere you can go
where we won't find you, Steve.

242
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:51,274
You know that.

243
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:52,571
I think that's probably right,
John.

244
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:54,178
Go! Go!

245
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:41,577
Charlie.

246
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:44,622
We got to go, Charlie.

247
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,101
You always work in the dark?

248
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,837
Makes me feel like I'm alone.

249
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:16,145
Not bad.

250
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:17,909
Not bad, Stella.

251
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,745
Damn. Hurley couldn't
crack that safe.

252
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:21,046
Neither could Spears.
Now you know

253
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:22,051
who to call first.

254
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,087
You're expensive, Stella.

255
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:25,918
Those guys cut us a break
on subpoena jobs.

256
00:25:26,057 --> 00:25:27,718
Good will, community service.

257
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:29,885
I do it for the money, Paul.

258
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:31,451
I'll be sending you a bill.

259
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,327
Don't you want to see
what's inside?

260
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:34,422
I never look inside.

261
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:37,094
Have a good day.
Hey, George.

262
00:25:37,168 --> 00:25:38,192
Hi, Stella.

263
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:41,171
I came, I saw, I kicked some ass

264
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:44,402
The pain I cause,
it makes me laugh

265
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:46,137
'Cause the way I do my thing
is strange

266
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,907
Time, time for this girl
to sing

267
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,710
Damn if I thought
that you would change

268
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:53,944
And my life would stay
the same

269
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,418
Things will come
and things will go

270
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:58,820
And one thing I know
for sure

271
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:02,849
Is that the wreckoning,
the wreckoning, the wreckoning

272
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:04,520
I'm walking out the door

273
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:07,827
Wreckoning, the wreckoning,
the wreckoning

274
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,662
Oh, it's time...

275
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:14,103
How long to crack it?

276
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:16,572
Four minutes and 43 seconds.

277
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:17,573
Oh! You're the man.

278
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:18,631
What's on the lineup?

279
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:19,836
Todd Milliken called.

280
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,435
He has a prototype
combination lock.

281
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:22,844
He wants you to test out.

282
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,040
He says he added

283
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:27,084
two false contact points
on the tumbler.

284
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:28,915
I'll pretend to be stumped
for a couple of seconds,

285
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:30,112
give him a thrill.

286
00:26:30,188 --> 00:26:32,418
And, there's a Charlie Croker
in your office.

287
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,719
Says you two know each other.

288
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:41,530
Charlie Croker.

289
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,124
Hey, Stella.

290
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:48,128
Didn't I tell you I never
want to see you again?

291
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:51,771
I think it was when you told me
how my father died,

292
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:53,276
right in front of your eyes,

293
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:55,210
after you pulled him
in for one last job.

294
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:01,641
We found him, Stella.

295
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,450
He's in Los Angeles.

296
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:05,580
The gold bricks he stole from us

297
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:06,988
had a Balinese dancer
stamped on them.

298
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:08,286
I just got word,

299
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,725
from a contact of mine
called Skinny Pete,

300
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:12,126
that a gold dealer out in L.A.
has been buying those bricks.

301
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:13,824
Yeah?

302
00:27:13,898 --> 00:27:15,263
Well, how do you know it's him?

303
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:19,059
Skinny Pete sent me this.

304
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,298
Steve changed his last
name to Frazelli.

305
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:29,277
Why you telling me
all of this?

306
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:31,542
Been checking out the databases
behind safe companies.

307
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:33,174
Found out Steve
had a Worthington 1000

308
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:34,684
delivered to his home office.

309
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:36,186
You don't install
a Worthington 1000

310
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:37,846
unless you've got something
really big to guard.

311
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:38,911
No, you don't.

312
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:39,922
The problem now is no one

313
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:41,253
in my crew
can handle Steve's safe.

314
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,419
And I need somebody
I can trust.

315
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,087
Look, I'm a professional
safe and vault technician.

316
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,425
I'm not a thief.

317
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,363
Hey, it's not about the gold,
Stella, okay?

318
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:49,661
John was like a father
to me, too.

319
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:56,635
Look, I'm sorry, all right?

320
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:58,642
I just can't move on until
I've set things right.

321
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,282
I've moved on.

322
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:12,075
Come on, Charlie.

323
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:14,175
Come on.

324
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:21,387
Hello?

325
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:23,324
I want to see the look
on that man's face

326
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:24,725
when his gold is gone.

327
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:27,959
He took my father from me;
I'm taking this.

328
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:33,436
She's in.

329
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:35,132
That's a good thing?

330
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:36,264
It's a very good thing.

331
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:38,206
She can crack a Worthington 1000
without even flinching.

332
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:39,766
I'm not sure having
a civilian on the crew's

333
00:29:39,844 --> 00:29:40,902
a good idea, Charlie.

334
00:29:41,012 --> 00:29:41,910
She's got the skill

335
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:43,105
and she's got the motivation.

336
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:44,614
Exactly.

337
00:29:44,682 --> 00:29:45,910
She's emotional.

338
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:48,212
You know what happens
when emotion gets into it.

339
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,844
Look, don't kid yourself,
all right?

340
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:51,320
We're all emotional on this one.

341
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:53,619
Let's go.

342
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:55,215
Are you ready?

343
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:56,385
Of course I am.

344
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:00,555
You're not ready.

345
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:27,316
That was quick.

346
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:28,450
Where are they?

347
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:29,720
We're a little early.

348
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:32,388
I didn't expect us to get here
quite that fast.

349
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:34,623
There.

350
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:35,757
That's Lyle.

351
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,461
He's my computer genius.

352
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:44,941
You know, he's who really
invented Napster.

353
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,408
At least that's how
Lyle tells it.

354
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:49,605
Said Shawn Fanning
was his roommate in college

355
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,512
and stole his idea.

356
00:31:03,828 --> 00:31:06,422
Think it's his first time
riding that bike, though.

357
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:10,134
Hey.

358
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,196
Oh...

359
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:15,869
You okay?

360
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:18,708
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

361
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:20,869
That's Left Ear.

362
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:22,945
Demolition and explosives.

363
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:23,946
When he was ten,

364
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:25,913
he put one too many M-80s
in the toilet bowl.

365
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:28,612
Fire...

366
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:30,381
Whoa.

367
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:31,547
Yeah, that was cool.

368
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:32,817
How'd you do that?

369
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:33,915
What?!

370
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:35,289
How'd you do that?

371
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,349
What?!

372
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:38,793
I said,
how did you do that?

373
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:41,229
What?!

374
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:42,926
Lost the hearing
in his right ear.

375
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:45,196
He's been blowing
stuff up ever since.

376
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:49,834
Handsome Rob.

377
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:50,966
Premier wheel man.

378
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:52,440
Once drove all the way
from Los Angeles

379
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:54,410
just so he could set the record
for longest freeway chase.

380
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:05,483
- You're a heartbreaker...
- You know, he got 110

381
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:06,921
Iove letters
sent to his jail cell

382
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:08,583
from women
who saw him on the news?

383
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,821
You're a heartbreaker

384
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:12,385
Dream-maker

385
00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:13,395
Love-taker

386
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:15,489
Don't you mess around,
no, no, no...

387
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:21,667
And you?

388
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:24,230
I never heard
how you got your start.

389
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:26,436
Me?

390
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:29,207
Well, I've been a thief
since I had baby teeth.

391
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,340
Okay, you both know what to do.

392
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:33,816
Cough it up, now!

393
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:37,753
Come on, now,
shake it, shake it, baby, ho!

394
00:32:37,822 --> 00:32:39,756
One, two, three, baby...

395
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:41,785
Watch it, spaz!

396
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:43,554
Hey, now, do, re, me, baby...

397
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:44,595
Hey, what's your problem, man?

398
00:32:44,662 --> 00:32:47,130
A-B-C, it's easy

399
00:32:47,198 --> 00:32:48,961
As one, two, three...

400
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:50,966
Hey, Charlie.

401
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:52,161
Good to see you, man.

402
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:53,430
- Looking good.
- Yeah?

403
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,904
- Charlie Hustle.
- Good to see you.

404
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:56,906
Hello, Charlie.

405
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,567
Rob, what's up?
Good?

406
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,133
Guys...

407
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:01,303
Stella Bridger.

408
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:03,609
Hi.

409
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:04,613
How you doing?

410
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:05,808
Nice to meet you.

411
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:06,907
Phones?

412
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:08,178
Yeah, they're all
fresh and clean,

413
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:09,685
I got internal chips in them.

414
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:10,846
Please change them twice a day.

415
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:12,651
We will get heat on line.

416
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:13,918
I.D. s?

417
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:17,792
"James Hymen?"

418
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:20,092
Come on, man, one time,
give me a cool name.

419
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,325
140 pounds? Try 165.

420
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,662
Try lifting some weights.

421
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:25,168
- Try lifting up these.
- Guys, enough.

422
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:26,669
Come on, we leave
tomorrow, all right?

423
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:27,670
Let's go.

424
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:28,831
Hey, Charlie...

425
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:31,938
Handsome, can you help
him with the bike?

426
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:35,207
Yeah, help Knievel set up
for his next jump.

427
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:38,808
Like a sound you hear
that lingers in your ear

428
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:43,479
But you can't forget,
from sundown to sunset

429
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:46,387
No, no

430
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:48,948
It puts a brand-new kind
of thinkin' in your mind

431
00:33:49,093 --> 00:33:50,390
And you can't go wrong

432
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:55,194
'Cause you're groovin'
all day long, ha-ha!

433
00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:57,757
California soul

434
00:33:57,835 --> 00:34:00,497
Ooh-ooh-ooh

435
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:04,564
California soul...

436
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:07,304
Man, out of all of the places
for a thief to hide,

437
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,039
this joker picked Hollywood.

438
00:34:09,113 --> 00:34:11,377
He's a punk,
but he ain't stupid.

439
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:12,916
All right...

440
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,780
we need to figure out a way
to get in Steve's house

441
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:16,581
and make a video blueprint
of the interior.

442
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:18,781
I want audio surveillance
on his phone.

443
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:20,346
Oh, yeah, I been wanting
to try something.

444
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:21,858
I crack into the phone company's

445
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:23,689
remote monitoring system,
and fool it into thinking

446
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:24,785
there's a legal tap on the line.

447
00:34:24,862 --> 00:34:25,829
Just reroute the digital copies

448
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,364
of the calls to our own
listening post.

449
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:28,797
I been doing it
to my ex for years.

450
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:30,333
How long?

451
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,028
No... how long will it take?

452
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:33,627
Not how long have you
been doing it to your ex.

453
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:35,433
I'll burn through the night;
I'll have it running by morning.

454
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:39,638
Sorry I'm late.

455
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,507
We got to work on getting
Steve out of the house.

456
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,240
Stella, how much time you need
with the Worthington?

457
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:45,782
Five minutes flat.

458
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:47,317
Don't be cocky, young lady.

459
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:49,512
It's not the same as opening
a safe for the police.

460
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:52,515
The perspiration
on your fingertips,

461
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,057
your heart's pounding
in your ears...

462
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:55,183
whole different ball game.

463
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:58,728
I appreciate your concern.
I'll be fine.

464
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:01,591
Look, just remember,

465
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:02,724
this is all the easy part, okay?

466
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,062
It's the getaway
that can get us caught.

467
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:05,261
So what's the sketch?

468
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:06,360
We drive to Union Station.

469
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:09,235
Getaway car goes
right onto the train with us.

470
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:10,899
We need to know exactly
how long it's going to take

471
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:13,033
to get from Steve's house
to Union Station.

472
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:45,238
Oh, great.

473
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,640
Carson Security System.

474
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:48,576
How good is it?

475
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,307
Carson's held
an annual contest...

476
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:52,941
$50,000 to anybody
that can bypass the system.

477
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:55,518
The Who's Who of ex-cons
always show up.

478
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:58,749
Five years running,
no one's been paid.

479
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:01,417
Okay, party people,
here's the status.

480
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:02,789
It's an anti-scaling fence.

481
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,828
It's hardened,
electro-plated steel.

482
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:06,887
Yeah, I'm going
to have to paint that up

483
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:08,056
with some nitromin.

484
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:09,394
Security on the property?

485
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:10,832
Got an armed guard here.

486
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:11,891
Little rent-a-cop,

487
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:13,402
with a nine-millimeter
on his hip.

488
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:14,870
But that booth...

489
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:17,874
Security booth looks prime
for a chemical grenade.

490
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:19,307
Nitromin, chemical grenades...

491
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:21,504
I mean, that stuff's
pretty hard to come by.

492
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:23,376
Yeah, Lyle, it's a bear market.

493
00:36:25,249 --> 00:36:26,910
Shit.

494
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:29,716
This dude got dogs.

495
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:31,584
I don't do dogs.

496
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:34,147
I had a...
real bad experience, man.

497
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:35,487
What happened?

498
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,757
I had a bad experience.

499
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:40,558
Damn it. I'm deaf.

500
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,942
You turn in your badge

501
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:59,106
and your weap...
Oh, shoot.

502
00:36:59,183 --> 00:37:01,481
Turn in your badge
and your weapon!

503
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:03,485
Crush.

504
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:04,543
I don't want to see you

505
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:06,817
anywhere near
this investigation.

506
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,724
And turn in
your badge and your weapon.

507
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:10,726
I don't want to see you

508
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:12,353
anywhere near
this investigation.

509
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,757
Hey! It's a green!

510
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:19,394
Turn in your badge
and your weapon.

511
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,267
- Green!
- I don't want to see you

512
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:22,067
anywhere near this...

513
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:24,669
Turn in your badge
and your weapon.

514
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:30,209
Unbelievable.

515
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:43,827
There he is.

516
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:05,241
Let's get to work.

517
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:11,714
It's either bad traffic,
peak traffic,

518
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:13,222
slit-your-wrist traffic.

519
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,521
You know, five people died
from smoking

520
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:16,890
in between traffic lights today.

521
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,895
You know, they do have
the Metrorail, Rob.

522
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,260
You could always use that.

523
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:21,457
That'd be ideal

524
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:23,466
for carrying a ton of gold,
wouldn't it, genius?

525
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:25,662
What's your guesstimate?

526
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:28,227
The last 20 times
I've done the journey,

527
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:31,400
you've got an average of 32
minutes and a top time of 50,

528
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:33,409
but if we had green
lights all the way,

529
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,069
we could do it in 14 minutes.

530
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,307
Wait, you couldn't get
through traffic?

531
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:41,583
Whoa.

532
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:46,421
We could do anything
with green lights all the way.

533
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,355
Lyle?

534
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:50,257
Lyle?

535
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:53,152
I'll see what I can do.

536
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,469
You're right on time.

537
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:06,539
All these poor bastards
out there,

538
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,373
putting their life
savings in banks,

539
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:10,380
and S&Ls, and mutual funds.

540
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:12,712
How do they think,
when the collapse comes,

541
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:14,546
they can depend
on the government?

542
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:15,880
I don't think so.

543
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:17,317
Are you taping me?

544
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:19,049
Of course not.

545
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:20,784
I never tape you...
come look,

546
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:21,950
see for yourself.

547
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:27,556
Governments are nothing more
than puppets and strings

548
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:31,123
in a world where NAFTA
can overrule the Supreme Court.

549
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,295
Like my cousin Mashkov

550
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:36,465
always says: "This
is our only refuge, baby...

551
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:39,532
gold."

552
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:48,743
Every time I look
at these engravings...

553
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:51,583
She's so beautiful.

554
00:39:51,655 --> 00:39:53,748
Where'd you say you got these?

555
00:39:53,824 --> 00:39:54,950
I didn't.

556
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:02,856
A little walking around money.

557
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,078
I guess I'm not walking
as far as I thought.

558
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:16,113
I'm... sorry.

559
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,647
I can only buy two bricks
from you today.

560
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:19,615
- That wasn't the agreement.
- What can I say?

561
00:40:19,683 --> 00:40:20,945
I'm just middleman.

562
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:23,282
I'll buy the other two
from you on Wednesday.

563
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:24,821
Don't waste my time, Yevhen.

564
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:36,967
So, what does a man

565
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:40,002
with 35 million dollars worth
of gold do at night?

566
00:40:42,706 --> 00:40:45,266
He watches his big-ass TV.

567
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:49,838
That's our in.

568
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:13,468
Stella.

569
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:15,437
Jesus!

570
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:17,269
Charlie!

571
00:41:17,341 --> 00:41:18,774
How did you get in here?

572
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:20,310
I knocked,
but you didn't answer.

573
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:22,811
What... so you just
let yourself in?

574
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,108
I was just making sure
you were okay.

575
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:25,478
I apologize. I just...

576
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,381
- I...
- Don't look.

577
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:34,021
Okay.

578
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:38,426
You got a lot of stuff here.

579
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:41,397
You know,
your dad was old school.

580
00:41:41,465 --> 00:41:43,365
Did the whole thing by touch.

581
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:45,459
That worked for him;
this works for me.

582
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:48,505
Technology guarantees speed
and accuracy, you know?

583
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:51,063
Yeah, but there's no guarantees
in this business, Stella.

584
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,644
Why the headphones?

585
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:56,475
Just training myself.

586
00:41:56,547 --> 00:41:59,175
Ambient noises, you know,
just in case.

587
00:42:02,152 --> 00:42:03,847
What do you want, Charlie?

588
00:42:05,155 --> 00:42:06,747
We're going to knock out
Steve's cable,

589
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:08,485
and we need to send in
a repairman.

590
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:10,925
To get your video blueprint
of the interior.

591
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:12,426
Yep.

592
00:42:12,496 --> 00:42:15,192
Only problem is
Steve thinks we're all dead.

593
00:42:17,501 --> 00:42:18,661
Except me.

594
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:23,499
I'll do it, Charlie.

595
00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:27,010
I'm in all the way,
whatever it takes.

596
00:42:28,612 --> 00:42:29,544
All right.

597
00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:31,103
I'll set it up.

598
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:32,273
Okay.

599
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:33,839
Um... you, um...

600
00:42:33,918 --> 00:42:35,510
maybe want to get a drink
downstairs with me

601
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:36,610
before I go back to my room?

602
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:42,625
I sh... I should finish
this stuff up, you know?

603
00:42:42,693 --> 00:42:44,752
Just get it all done tonight.

604
00:42:44,828 --> 00:42:46,455
Yeah.

605
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:47,690
Sorry I scared you.

606
00:42:47,765 --> 00:42:49,767
It's okay.

607
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:49,833
|

608
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:51,425
Good night.

609
00:42:52,503 --> 00:42:54,300
Bye.

610
00:42:54,371 --> 00:42:56,965
And then he's just...
the media darling.

611
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:58,633
He's on the cover
of all the magazines.

612
00:42:58,709 --> 00:43:00,904
I should've been on the cover
of Wired Magazine.

613
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:01,909
You know what he said?

614
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:03,377
He said he...
he named it Napster

615
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:04,675
because it-it was his nickname,

616
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,739
'cause of the nappy hair
under the hat,

617
00:43:06,817 --> 00:43:08,910
but he... it's 'cause
I was napping

618
00:43:08,986 --> 00:43:10,920
when he stole it from me!

619
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:13,580
He didn't even graduate.

620
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:16,592
I think it's time to move on,
don't you?

621
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:17,592
They shut him down.

622
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:20,630
I wish they'd
do the same to you.

623
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:22,825
Here... here we go.

624
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,299
Cable chick.

625
00:43:35,879 --> 00:43:36,937
Becky.

626
00:43:37,014 --> 00:43:38,606
Nice name... I wonder
what she calls

627
00:43:38,682 --> 00:43:39,614
the other one.

628
00:43:39,683 --> 00:43:40,945
And it's such a mystery

629
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:42,849
why you don't have
a girlfriend, Lyle.

630
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:45,445
So, all we need is a...

631
00:43:45,522 --> 00:43:46,784
service truck like that one,

632
00:43:46,857 --> 00:43:48,848
a work shirt like hers.

633
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:51,258
You think Stella
can pull it off?

634
00:43:51,328 --> 00:43:52,795
I have my doubts.

635
00:43:52,863 --> 00:43:54,990
There's no talking
to Charlie, though.

636
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:58,964
You think he's...

637
00:43:59,036 --> 00:44:01,470
mixing business with pleasure?

638
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:03,768
He should know better.

639
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:05,468
Only I'm allowed to do that.

640
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:09,905
Right. Where you going?

641
00:44:10,014 --> 00:44:12,278
To get a work shirt
and a service truck.

642
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:23,023
Are you kidding me?

643
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:29,223
How does he do that?

644
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:30,266
How do you do that?

645
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:31,562
What are you saying?

646
00:44:31,635 --> 00:44:33,068
Hey, how are you?

647
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:34,536
Oh, good. I'm good.

648
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:37,438
Nice to meet you,
I'm... Handsome Rob.

649
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:38,839
And you are...?

650
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:40,274
Oh, my name's...
my name's Becky,

651
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:41,709
but it's written on my shirt.

652
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:44,771
Listen, I'm going to need
your shirt... and your truck.

653
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:46,338
Perfect.
I'll give them both to you.

654
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:48,612
Would you... would you like
my virginity as well?

655
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,176
If it's on the menu.

656
00:44:50,254 --> 00:44:51,778
Ha, ha, ha, ha,
oh, you're so witty.

657
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:53,652
Why don't you
take advantage of me?

658
00:44:53,724 --> 00:44:55,624
Yeah, you're
not too bright, are you?

659
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:56,625
No.

660
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:57,888
Perfect.

661
00:46:44,034 --> 00:46:45,763
What can I do for you,
Mr. Frazelli?

662
00:46:45,836 --> 00:46:47,098
The cable's out.

663
00:46:47,171 --> 00:46:48,604
The TV, the modem, everything.

664
00:46:48,672 --> 00:46:50,936
Now, get somebody up here,
and tell them to hurry up.

665
00:46:56,747 --> 00:46:58,544
Netcom Cable,
how can I help you?

666
00:46:58,615 --> 00:47:01,015
Hi, I'm up at 3320 East Skyway,
and the cable's

667
00:47:01,084 --> 00:47:02,711
just gone out...
our modem, everything.

668
00:47:02,786 --> 00:47:04,378
Okay, um, let's see, sir.

669
00:47:04,454 --> 00:47:06,445
I have a Thursday
between 9:00 and 3:00

670
00:47:06,523 --> 00:47:07,615
if that would be good.

671
00:47:07,691 --> 00:47:09,215
That's going to work. Thank you.

672
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:11,921
Guard just called
the cable company.

673
00:47:13,197 --> 00:47:15,324
What time's the appointment?

674
00:47:15,399 --> 00:47:17,333
Thursday between 9:00 and 3:00.

675
00:47:26,643 --> 00:47:27,575
Hello?

676
00:47:27,644 --> 00:47:29,009
Hi, I'm calling
from Netcom Cable.

677
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:30,410
I understand your service
is out,

678
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,175
and there was an appointment
set up for Thursday.

679
00:47:32,249 --> 00:47:33,181
Yes.

680
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:34,512
Well, we have
a technician working

681
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:36,143
in your area who's finished
with an appointment

682
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:37,152
earlier than expected.

683
00:47:37,221 --> 00:47:38,745
Will somebody be there
for the next hour?

684
00:47:38,822 --> 00:47:40,084
Sure, that'd be great.

685
00:47:40,157 --> 00:47:42,557
All right, our technician
will see you then.

686
00:47:42,626 --> 00:47:43,593
Have a nice day.

687
00:47:44,995 --> 00:47:46,758
Here's all the paperwork
you need.

688
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:49,765
Just get him to sign
and date at the bottom.

689
00:47:49,833 --> 00:47:52,301
Let's check out the camera.

690
00:47:54,638 --> 00:47:58,404
Stella,
you'll be going patriotic today.

691
00:48:00,477 --> 00:48:01,842
Make sure you walk slowly,

692
00:48:01,912 --> 00:48:03,345
or the image will streak.

693
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:04,345
- Ow.
- Ooh.

694
00:48:04,414 --> 00:48:05,904
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

695
00:48:07,184 --> 00:48:08,674
Sorry... Couldn't pin

696
00:48:08,752 --> 00:48:10,219
the corsage
on my prom date either.

697
00:48:10,287 --> 00:48:11,219
But you had a prom date?

698
00:48:11,288 --> 00:48:13,415
It was his cousin.

699
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:15,014
There's cable lines

700
00:48:15,092 --> 00:48:16,889
in the kitchen,
living room, bedroom,

701
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,791
and the cable modem on
the computer in the office.

702
00:48:18,862 --> 00:48:21,262
You need to locate
the safe in the office.

703
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:24,358
Okay.

704
00:48:24,434 --> 00:48:26,061
Just want you to know

705
00:48:26,136 --> 00:48:27,296
I think you're very
brave going in there.

706
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:28,303
I know it won't be easy.

707
00:48:28,372 --> 00:48:30,135
I second that.

708
00:48:32,142 --> 00:48:33,871
It's going to be fine.

709
00:48:35,178 --> 00:48:36,736
What?

710
00:48:36,813 --> 00:48:38,804
You know what fine stands for?

711
00:48:38,882 --> 00:48:39,871
Freaked Out. Insecure...

712
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:43,044
Neurotic, and Emotional.

713
00:48:47,858 --> 00:48:49,052
You'll be great.

714
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:50,260
Yeah.

715
00:49:01,838 --> 00:49:03,203
Morning.

716
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:04,501
Can I see some I.D.?

717
00:49:13,984 --> 00:49:16,179
Thanks for coming so soon.

718
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:17,720
Hey, that's part of the job.

719
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:19,278
All right.

720
00:49:50,087 --> 00:49:52,521
Aston Martin Vanquish.

721
00:49:52,589 --> 00:49:56,320
Looks like that bastard
took my car.

722
00:49:59,029 --> 00:50:01,793
Nasty-ass dogs.

723
00:50:01,865 --> 00:50:04,595
Hey! Hey!

724
00:50:10,474 --> 00:50:11,532
Relax,

725
00:50:11,608 --> 00:50:13,735
Jesus Christ.

726
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:16,040
Come on,
they won't bother you now.

727
00:50:17,114 --> 00:50:19,241
Come on.

728
00:50:20,817 --> 00:50:22,444
House.

729
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:24,487
Go on, get out of here.

730
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:30,618
It's okay,

731
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:33,356
I'm used to running into
all sorts of animals on my job.

732
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:38,029
Steve Frazelli.

733
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,102
Becky.

734
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:46,108
Want to show me that problem?

735
00:50:46,176 --> 00:50:47,803
Yeah, of course.

736
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:49,106
This way.

737
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:51,977
You have a really nice house.

738
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:54,313
Yeah. 1922.

739
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:56,978
All the original tiles.

740
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:58,646
Every stone in that courtyard

741
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:01,452
hauled from some
monastery in Seville.

742
00:51:01,525 --> 00:51:02,924
What a tactic.

743
00:51:02,993 --> 00:51:04,290
Monastery?

744
00:51:04,361 --> 00:51:06,693
Monastery for punk-ass creeps.

745
00:51:06,763 --> 00:51:09,357
You don't seem impressed.

746
00:51:09,433 --> 00:51:11,765
No, it's just that I don't think
lugging a bunch of rocks

747
00:51:11,835 --> 00:51:14,429
from one place to another
is quite... that interesting.

748
00:51:14,504 --> 00:51:16,768
You know, it doesn't quite
do it for me.

749
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,104
What does do it for you?

750
00:51:19,176 --> 00:51:22,441
Um... TVs?

751
00:51:22,512 --> 00:51:24,241
I have a monster TV.

752
00:51:25,315 --> 00:51:26,509
Not working right now, but...

753
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:28,278
But you know, I should
probably check out

754
00:51:28,351 --> 00:51:29,943
the cable modem, you know.

755
00:51:30,053 --> 00:51:31,452
Yeah? Yeah, right.

756
00:51:31,521 --> 00:51:32,988
Over here.

757
00:51:35,058 --> 00:51:38,459
I paid 30 grand to some punk kid
to put this system in.

758
00:51:38,528 --> 00:51:39,961
One day, it just goes out.

759
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:43,659
I ought to have him strung up.

760
00:51:46,503 --> 00:51:47,401
Here we go.

761
00:51:47,471 --> 00:51:48,438
There's our baby.

762
00:51:49,473 --> 00:51:50,963
We got him.

763
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:52,872
Got any, uh, wiring
coming through here?

764
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:54,501
There's no wiring in here.

765
00:51:57,714 --> 00:51:58,806
Just right here?

766
00:51:58,882 --> 00:51:59,814
Yeah.

767
00:51:59,883 --> 00:52:01,680
Look at that, that's my...

768
00:52:01,751 --> 00:52:03,582
That's my NAD T770.
That's...

769
00:52:03,653 --> 00:52:05,587
That's my stereo.

770
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:07,145
I bet most of your customers

771
00:52:07,224 --> 00:52:09,454
are pretty surprised when
they go to open the door

772
00:52:09,526 --> 00:52:11,084
for the cable man
and find you standing there.

773
00:52:11,161 --> 00:52:12,355
Oh, yeah.

774
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:14,294
He's hitting on her.

775
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:15,456
There's no problem here.

776
00:52:15,532 --> 00:52:17,159
I should maybe
just check the TVs.

777
00:52:18,668 --> 00:52:20,499
Okay.

778
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:24,773
You know what,
end this shit right now.

779
00:52:24,841 --> 00:52:25,773
I'm going to blow this shit

780
00:52:25,842 --> 00:52:27,275
right off the mountain
right now.

781
00:52:27,344 --> 00:52:29,312
No, no, no.
No, no, hey, hey, hey.

782
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:35,750
I see you got the AVM processor.

783
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,616
Only the best.

784
00:52:37,687 --> 00:52:39,655
Check the box.

785
00:52:45,095 --> 00:52:48,189
I'm just going to...
reset your system.

786
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:52,133
Sometimes these things just get
jammed up you know?

787
00:52:52,202 --> 00:52:53,837
That should do it.

788
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:53,904
|

789
00:52:53,904 --> 00:52:55,804
It's fixed?

790
00:52:55,872 --> 00:52:58,306
Turn her on, let's see.

791
00:52:58,375 --> 00:52:59,467
Now.

792
00:53:01,978 --> 00:53:03,536
Japan's Nikkei index...

793
00:53:03,613 --> 00:53:05,080
Perfect.

794
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:07,408
...was the ending price

795
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:09,247
and as you can see,
we've now gone below...

796
00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:11,753
Becky, huh?

797
00:53:11,821 --> 00:53:14,722
Have we met before?

798
00:53:14,791 --> 00:53:16,918
...a loss of 1.1 percent
on the...

799
00:53:16,993 --> 00:53:18,756
No, I don't think so.

800
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:20,261
If you can just sign there.

801
00:53:21,665 --> 00:53:23,656
So, if I was to ask you
out to dinner...

802
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:25,394
would I be the first
one of your customers

803
00:53:25,468 --> 00:53:26,594
to ever do that?

804
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:29,696
What, you asked your last cable
repair guy out for a date?

805
00:53:29,773 --> 00:53:31,764
No, but the last one
was, like, 300 pounds,

806
00:53:31,841 --> 00:53:32,933
had a handlebar mustache.

807
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:34,101
You know, not really my type.

808
00:53:34,177 --> 00:53:36,668
I don't think it's a good idea.

809
00:53:36,746 --> 00:53:38,941
Why, is that, like,
some, cable company rule?

810
00:53:39,082 --> 00:53:41,778
No, actually, it's just my rule.

811
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:43,546
I don't go out
with strange men.

812
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:46,555
I just met you five minutes ago.

813
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:49,057
So, I guess I have to, like,
sabotage my cable, you know,

814
00:53:49,125 --> 00:53:50,956
till we get to know each other
well enough.

815
00:53:53,196 --> 00:53:54,720
Have a nice day.

816
00:53:54,798 --> 00:53:56,732
Come on,

817
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,199
I'll be a perfect
gentleman, I promise.

818
00:53:58,268 --> 00:53:59,792
I won't even ask you
for your phone number.

819
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:00,893
I'll just... I'll meet you.

820
00:54:00,971 --> 00:54:03,462
Anywhere you want to go.

821
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:07,476
Come on, break your rule once.

822
00:54:08,545 --> 00:54:10,274
It's just dinner.

823
00:54:15,318 --> 00:54:17,809
Is that a yes?

824
00:54:27,831 --> 00:54:30,425
Are you okay?

825
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,934
Yeah.

826
00:54:33,003 --> 00:54:35,130
He touched my hand.

827
00:54:37,173 --> 00:54:39,971
He came on to me.

828
00:54:42,846 --> 00:54:44,780
Hey, at least I...

829
00:54:44,848 --> 00:54:47,442
I created a window
of opportunity, right?

830
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:52,283
When he goes out Friday night,
we go in.

831
00:54:52,355 --> 00:54:54,118
By the time he realizes
you've stood him up,

832
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:55,953
we'll be long gone
with that gold.

833
00:54:56,026 --> 00:54:57,857
Yeah.

834
00:54:59,029 --> 00:55:01,554
Make sure you shuffle
them cards this time, Left.

835
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:03,565
Hey, Lyle,

836
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:05,897
what's the distance between
the front door and the vault?

837
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,231
Don't deal
when my back's turned.

838
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:09,738
You've got that loser's
paranoia.

839
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:11,000
Lyle!

840
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:13,304
He only answers
to The Napster now, Charlie.

841
00:55:13,376 --> 00:55:14,570
No.

842
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:16,771
I'm not calling you The Napster.

843
00:55:16,846 --> 00:55:18,074
Why not, you call him Left Ear.

844
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:19,080
Well, I am.

845
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:21,049
And him, Handsome Rob.

846
00:55:21,117 --> 00:55:22,675
Well, that's because
he is Handsome Rob.

847
00:55:22,752 --> 00:55:25,220
Well, you can call me
The Napster.

848
00:55:25,856 --> 00:55:28,381
Come on, they were at the
same college at the same time.

849
00:55:28,459 --> 00:55:30,620
Why are you encouraging this?

850
00:55:30,694 --> 00:55:32,457
It is a verifiable fact...

851
00:55:32,529 --> 00:55:34,929
he was my roommate,
he stole my ideas.

852
00:55:34,999 --> 00:55:36,762
I am The Napster.

853
00:55:37,835 --> 00:55:40,668
All right, all right.

854
00:55:40,738 --> 00:55:41,932
What is the distance

855
00:55:42,006 --> 00:55:44,839
between the front door
and the vault, Napster?

856
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:48,976
It's farther
than you want to carry it.

857
00:55:49,046 --> 00:55:51,037
Yeah, but, so,
how do we get the gold

858
00:55:51,115 --> 00:55:52,946
from the vault
to the getaway car?

859
00:55:53,017 --> 00:55:55,542
How wide is the hallway...
Napster?

860
00:56:00,724 --> 00:56:02,282
Six feet.

861
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:21,401
Okay, you've got your gold.

862
00:56:43,067 --> 00:56:44,227
Whoo!

863
00:57:21,405 --> 00:57:23,430
We need more cars
to handle the weight.

864
00:57:23,507 --> 00:57:25,805
Looks like I'm going to need
some help

865
00:57:25,876 --> 00:57:27,810
with the custom work, too.

866
00:57:27,878 --> 00:57:29,209
I know a man for the job.

867
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:32,248
So I modified the camera
to include the...

868
00:57:32,316 --> 00:57:35,080
so we can create really
hi-res digital maps.

869
00:57:35,152 --> 00:57:36,210
Who's that?

870
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:38,151
Rob's mechanic friend.

871
00:57:42,826 --> 00:57:44,088
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hey.

872
00:57:44,161 --> 00:57:45,822
Charlie, this is Wrench.

873
00:57:45,896 --> 00:57:47,363
Hey, what's up, man?

874
00:57:47,431 --> 00:57:49,126
Rob tells me you
got real talent.

875
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:50,666
We need some body work done.

876
00:57:50,734 --> 00:57:55,137
Need to pack up to 2,700 pounds
of cargo in these Minis

877
00:57:55,205 --> 00:57:56,502
with enough suspension
and horsepower

878
00:57:56,573 --> 00:57:58,598
to outrun anything chasing us.

879
00:57:58,675 --> 00:58:00,438
2,700 pounds of what?

880
00:58:00,511 --> 00:58:02,741
Of whatever.

881
00:58:04,848 --> 00:58:06,907
So, what do I get out
of this mystery deal, man?

882
00:58:06,984 --> 00:58:08,417
10,000.

883
00:58:10,421 --> 00:58:12,082
All right.

884
00:58:22,566 --> 00:58:24,557
<i>What comes around...</i>

885
00:58:38,148 --> 00:58:40,480
Oh, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey.

886
00:58:40,551 --> 00:58:42,416
We didn't get a chance
to meet yet.

887
00:58:42,486 --> 00:58:44,010
Wrench.

888
00:58:45,222 --> 00:58:46,985
Ham and cheese.

889
00:58:47,057 --> 00:58:48,718
Oh. Oh, that's cold.

890
00:58:48,792 --> 00:58:50,885
Damn, that's cold. Mmm.

891
00:58:53,897 --> 00:58:55,091
<i>What comes around</i>

892
00:58:57,134 --> 00:58:59,625
<i>Just comes around</i>

893
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:16,283
<i>What comes around</i>

894
00:59:19,756 --> 00:59:20,620
<i>What comes around...</i>

895
00:59:36,370 --> 00:59:37,632
You want all greens?

896
00:59:37,705 --> 00:59:39,036
'Cause, ah, 'cause you got them.

897
00:59:40,107 --> 00:59:41,165
What have you got?

898
00:59:41,242 --> 00:59:43,574
Welcome to L.A. 's
Automated Traffic Surveillance

899
00:59:43,644 --> 00:59:45,737
and Control Operations Center.

900
00:59:45,813 --> 00:59:47,576
See, they use video feeds
from intersections

901
00:59:47,648 --> 00:59:48,876
and specifically designed
algorithms

902
00:59:48,949 --> 00:59:50,610
to predict traffic conditions,

903
00:59:50,684 --> 00:59:52,345
and thereby control
traffic lights, so

904
00:59:52,419 --> 00:59:54,353
all I did was come up
with my own

905
00:59:54,421 --> 00:59:56,821
kick-ass algorithm to sneak in,

906
00:59:56,891 --> 00:59:58,586
and now we own the place.

907
00:59:58,659 --> 00:59:59,626
You want to do a dry run?

908
00:59:59,693 --> 01:00:01,388
I thought you'd never ask.

909
01:00:03,531 --> 01:00:04,463
See, red light?

910
01:00:04,532 --> 01:00:05,499
Green light.

911
01:00:11,105 --> 01:00:12,129
- Danielson?
- Yeah?

912
01:00:12,206 --> 01:00:13,195
What's up with Grid 34?

913
01:00:13,274 --> 01:00:15,174
Let's check it out.

914
01:00:15,242 --> 01:00:16,641
Hey, hey.

915
01:00:16,710 --> 01:00:18,541
Oh, oops, did I...?

916
01:00:18,612 --> 01:00:21,080
Oops, wow, but it's awesome.
Is that not awesome?

917
01:00:21,148 --> 01:00:23,048
- Can you change it back now?
- Yeah.

918
01:00:28,789 --> 01:00:29,721
Lights are working fine.

919
01:00:29,790 --> 01:00:32,088
Just an accident.

920
01:00:33,394 --> 01:00:34,361
That's good.

921
01:00:35,896 --> 01:00:37,591
What are those?

922
01:00:37,665 --> 01:00:39,530
Unnecessary engine parts.

923
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:43,297
I lost your smog controls,
and 200 pounds of body fat.

924
01:00:43,370 --> 01:00:46,237
You got yourself
a sweet ride now, Charlie.

925
01:00:46,307 --> 01:00:47,399
Put the pedal to the metal
and I'm off

926
01:00:47,541 --> 01:00:48,633
And never getting lost

927
01:00:48,709 --> 01:00:50,176
Which way will I turn
when roads cross?

928
01:00:50,244 --> 01:00:51,939
Press the petal to the metal,
little more when it's scary

929
01:00:52,012 --> 01:00:53,946
But one thing for sure,
keep my foot on the floor

930
01:00:54,014 --> 01:00:55,242
Put the pedal to the metal
and I'm off

931
01:00:55,316 --> 01:00:56,943
And never getting lost

932
01:00:57,017 --> 01:00:58,644
Which way will I turn
when roads cross?

933
01:00:58,719 --> 01:01:00,846
Press the petal to the metal,
little more when it's scary

934
01:01:00,921 --> 01:01:03,287
But one thing for sure,
keep my foot on the floor

935
01:01:03,357 --> 01:01:05,917
Won't stop driving
till it's over

936
01:01:07,361 --> 01:01:12,094
Still be cruising
when the sun goes down

937
01:01:12,166 --> 01:01:14,600
Won't stop driving
till it's over

938
01:01:14,668 --> 01:01:16,363
Put the pedal to the metal
and I'm off

939
01:01:16,437 --> 01:01:17,768
And never getting lost

940
01:01:17,838 --> 01:01:19,362
Which way will I turn
when roads cross?

941
01:01:19,473 --> 01:01:21,873
Press the petal to the metal,
little more when it's scary

942
01:01:21,942 --> 01:01:24,740
But one thing for sure,
keep my foot on the floor...

943
01:01:28,549 --> 01:01:31,382
You know what
I'm thinking about right now?

944
01:01:31,485 --> 01:01:33,783
The look on Steve's face.

945
01:01:44,732 --> 01:01:45,664
You're early.

946
01:01:45,733 --> 01:01:47,360
I'm in a hurry.

947
01:01:50,471 --> 01:01:51,495
Of course, you know
that the Florida

948
01:01:51,572 --> 01:01:53,767
vote rigging was a CIA
and mob operation.

949
01:01:53,841 --> 01:01:54,773
Is that so?

950
01:01:54,842 --> 01:01:56,070
Yeah, which is not
so very different

951
01:01:56,143 --> 01:01:57,337
from when your John F. Kennedy

952
01:01:57,411 --> 01:02:00,107
won a rigged election
with the help of his father.

953
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:01,704
You're uncomfortable
that I mentioned it.

954
01:02:01,782 --> 01:02:04,307
No, Yevhen, I don't like
making two trips.

955
01:02:04,385 --> 01:02:06,216
You Americans.

956
01:02:06,286 --> 01:02:07,981
You love your heroes.

957
01:02:08,055 --> 01:02:10,922
A holiday for Columbus?

958
01:02:10,991 --> 01:02:12,856
He makes the wrong turn,

959
01:02:12,926 --> 01:02:15,360
and wipes out an entire
indigenous people.

960
01:02:15,462 --> 01:02:16,656
And you know
what he was looking for?

961
01:02:16,730 --> 01:02:18,357
I bet you're going to tell me.

962
01:02:18,465 --> 01:02:19,523
Gold.

963
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,363
Supposedly for Queen Isabella,

964
01:02:21,502 --> 01:02:23,231
but don't think that
the Medicis back in Italy

965
01:02:23,303 --> 01:02:24,793
didn't want a part
of that action.

966
01:02:24,872 --> 01:02:27,102
And what did Italy
need gold for?

967
01:02:27,174 --> 01:02:31,508
For the long-distance
slave trade based in Venice.

968
01:02:31,578 --> 01:02:32,840
Venice...
that's where

969
01:02:32,913 --> 01:02:34,847
these bricks...

970
01:02:40,087 --> 01:02:41,111
You were saying something?

971
01:02:41,188 --> 01:02:42,678
Nothing... No...

972
01:02:42,756 --> 01:02:43,882
No, you were really
on a roll there.

973
01:02:43,957 --> 01:02:45,322
Don't stop. I'm interested.

974
01:02:45,392 --> 01:02:47,292
Please, I'm confused,
my English...

975
01:02:49,663 --> 01:02:50,595
You understand fine.

976
01:02:50,664 --> 01:02:51,892
Now what do you know
about my gold?

977
01:02:51,965 --> 01:02:52,897
No, I don't...

978
01:02:52,966 --> 01:02:55,059
Don't you even think
about lying to me.

979
01:02:55,135 --> 01:02:58,127
Okay,
okay, l, I heard a rumor

980
01:02:58,205 --> 01:03:00,696
about a heist in Venice.

981
01:03:00,774 --> 01:03:03,038
35 million in bricks,

982
01:03:03,110 --> 01:03:05,442
with an imprint
of a Balinese dancer on them.

983
01:03:05,512 --> 01:03:07,002
- Who have you told?
- No one.

984
01:03:07,081 --> 01:03:08,013
Who have you told?

985
01:03:08,082 --> 01:03:10,050
No one!
I swear to God!

986
01:03:12,052 --> 01:03:13,178
You swear to God?

987
01:03:13,253 --> 01:03:15,687
You crazy?
I swear to God.

988
01:03:15,756 --> 01:03:16,723
I didn't!

989
01:03:18,258 --> 01:03:19,520
Well, then I guess
I believe you.

990
01:03:49,456 --> 01:03:50,889
Yevhen?

991
01:03:53,093 --> 01:03:54,583
Yevhen?

992
01:04:11,612 --> 01:04:12,772
Let's putt it this time...

993
01:04:13,914 --> 01:04:16,109
Putt, not drive.

994
01:04:16,183 --> 01:04:17,480
Very good.

995
01:04:17,551 --> 01:04:18,813
If you can just get it,

996
01:04:18,886 --> 01:04:20,820
I know you can,
I know you can do it.

997
01:04:20,888 --> 01:04:22,150
Much better.

998
01:04:22,222 --> 01:04:24,247
I'm here to see Skinny Pete.

999
01:04:24,324 --> 01:04:25,586
Yeah, he's over there.

1000
01:04:25,659 --> 01:04:27,217
Thanks, man.

1001
01:04:29,730 --> 01:04:31,129
- Don't stare.
- Huh?

1002
01:04:31,198 --> 01:04:32,256
Don't stare.

1003
01:04:32,332 --> 01:04:33,663
He doesn't like
when people stare at him.

1004
01:04:33,734 --> 01:04:34,701
Stare at what?

1005
01:04:36,036 --> 01:04:37,298
That was good.
That was good.

1006
01:04:37,371 --> 01:04:38,963
Try that one, I know
you're going to get that one.

1007
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:42,367
That was great.

1008
01:04:42,442 --> 01:04:44,137
- Skinny Pete.
- Yo, Charlie.

1009
01:04:44,211 --> 01:04:45,371
What's up, man?

1010
01:04:45,512 --> 01:04:46,774
How's it going?

1011
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:49,372
So was I right
about the gold bricks or what?

1012
01:04:49,483 --> 01:04:51,348
Oh, I'm not here to talk
about that. We need, uh...

1013
01:04:51,418 --> 01:04:53,682
some supplies.

1014
01:04:53,754 --> 01:04:54,686
Baby, go relax.

1015
01:04:54,755 --> 01:04:55,687
Baby...

1016
01:04:55,756 --> 01:04:57,121
Go relax.

1017
01:05:03,096 --> 01:05:04,188
Yo.

1018
01:05:04,264 --> 01:05:06,232
Yo.

1019
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:07,927
Supplies.

1020
01:05:08,001 --> 01:05:08,831
What's wrong?

1021
01:05:08,902 --> 01:05:09,994
Huh?

1022
01:05:10,070 --> 01:05:12,698
Uh... um, some, uh,

1023
01:05:12,773 --> 01:05:13,899
some nitromin,

1024
01:05:13,974 --> 01:05:15,635
uh...

1025
01:05:15,709 --> 01:05:17,142
some, uh...

1026
01:05:17,211 --> 01:05:19,441
some nitromin, primer...

1027
01:05:19,513 --> 01:05:20,878
- What's wrong?
- Huh?

1028
01:05:20,948 --> 01:05:21,346
Yo.

1029
01:05:21,415 --> 01:05:22,507
Uh, nothing.

1030
01:05:22,583 --> 01:05:23,515
I'm-I'm cool. I'm-I'm great.

1031
01:05:23,584 --> 01:05:25,211
Uh, I just need some,
uh, big can of...

1032
01:05:25,285 --> 01:05:27,219
Nitromin, primer,

1033
01:05:27,287 --> 01:05:28,549
- Detonating cord...
- Right, right.

1034
01:05:28,622 --> 01:05:30,681
...two triple-charged chemical
grenades and a launcher.

1035
01:05:30,757 --> 01:05:33,521
Right, like I had, uh,
you know, told you... earlier.

1036
01:05:33,594 --> 01:05:35,323
All right.

1037
01:05:41,201 --> 01:05:42,896
Cost you about five G's.

1038
01:05:42,970 --> 01:05:44,938
Done. Call me.

1039
01:05:46,173 --> 01:05:47,663
Thanks, man.
I'm sorry about that.

1040
01:05:47,741 --> 01:05:49,538
Uh-Uh, all right, man.

1041
01:05:49,610 --> 01:05:51,407
- Peace.
- Come on.

1042
01:06:09,062 --> 01:06:10,859
Get out.

1043
01:06:11,498 --> 01:06:12,692
There.

1044
01:06:21,942 --> 01:06:23,705
Vance has something
to tell you.

1045
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:28,206
Go on.

1046
01:06:30,918 --> 01:06:32,579
A couple weeks back...

1047
01:06:34,187 --> 01:06:36,815
I was working counter
at your cousin's shop.

1048
01:06:36,890 --> 01:06:39,586
A guy come in asking
about gold bricks with Balinese

1049
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:41,457
dancer on them.

1050
01:06:41,528 --> 01:06:42,961
What did you tell him?

1051
01:06:44,831 --> 01:06:47,026
I told him
that I'd seen some bricks.

1052
01:06:52,105 --> 01:06:54,130
I'm sorry.

1053
01:06:55,442 --> 01:06:57,933
What did this man look like?

1054
01:06:59,179 --> 01:07:00,146
He had, uh...

1055
01:07:00,213 --> 01:07:01,578
long black hair,

1056
01:07:01,648 --> 01:07:03,639
big tattoo on his neck.

1057
01:07:06,053 --> 01:07:09,250
He must have weighed
at least 400 pounds.

1058
01:07:09,323 --> 01:07:10,620
I know that guy.

1059
01:07:39,086 --> 01:07:40,747
Baby, go relax.

1060
01:07:51,932 --> 01:07:53,490
Do you know who I am?

1061
01:07:54,568 --> 01:07:56,035
You're Mashkov.

1062
01:07:56,103 --> 01:07:58,003
That's right.

1063
01:07:58,071 --> 01:08:00,699
You were asking
about gold bricks

1064
01:08:00,774 --> 01:08:02,435
with a Balinese dancer
on them.

1065
01:08:03,477 --> 01:08:04,967
Tell me why.

1066
01:08:12,252 --> 01:08:13,617
Steve just called to confirm

1067
01:08:13,687 --> 01:08:15,655
his 8:00 reservation
at the Water Grill.

1068
01:08:15,722 --> 01:08:17,087
Okay, let's go over it
one more time.

1069
01:08:17,157 --> 01:08:19,921
Gas the guards,
doors open 8:15.

1070
01:08:19,993 --> 01:08:21,961
Safe popped by 8:25.

1071
01:08:22,029 --> 01:08:24,429
Loaded by 8:35,
out the door by 8:45.

1072
01:08:24,498 --> 01:08:26,022
Straight to Union Station.

1073
01:08:26,099 --> 01:08:27,430
Only green lights on your route.

1074
01:08:27,501 --> 01:08:28,661
The rest of the city's red.

1075
01:08:28,735 --> 01:08:30,327
Cops are stuck in the traffic,
like everyone else.

1076
01:08:30,437 --> 01:08:31,461
Train leaves at 10:00.

1077
01:08:31,538 --> 01:08:33,733
Cars have to be
on the carrier by 9:30.

1078
01:08:33,807 --> 01:08:35,798
Timing's got to be dead on.

1079
01:08:35,876 --> 01:08:37,138
Let's get ready.

1080
01:08:37,210 --> 01:08:38,643
Let's get it.

1081
01:09:09,643 --> 01:09:12,305
Wow, that is a nice car.

1082
01:09:12,446 --> 01:09:14,107
Sorry, Rob.

1083
01:09:14,181 --> 01:09:15,375
Coast is clear, guys.

1084
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:28,192
This is it, guys.

1085
01:09:28,261 --> 01:09:29,228
Moment of truth.

1086
01:09:30,931 --> 01:09:32,057
What the hell is this?

1087
01:09:34,367 --> 01:09:36,232
Shit!

1088
01:09:36,303 --> 01:09:38,294
Steve's neighbor's
throwing a party.

1089
01:09:41,708 --> 01:09:43,300
Are you here
for the, uh, Baker party, sir?

1090
01:09:43,376 --> 01:09:45,173
No.

1091
01:09:47,681 --> 01:09:49,615
We're not blowing
any gates tonight, guys.

1092
01:09:49,683 --> 01:09:51,344
Too many witnesses.

1093
01:09:51,451 --> 01:09:52,475
Stella.

1094
01:09:52,552 --> 01:09:55,248
I know, I know.

1095
01:09:57,023 --> 01:09:58,923
I'm late for my date.

1096
01:09:58,992 --> 01:10:01,654
Yeah, and you got to be
charming.

1097
01:10:01,728 --> 01:10:03,355
You'll need him
to ask you out again.

1098
01:10:03,463 --> 01:10:04,725
Sorry.

1099
01:10:04,798 --> 01:10:07,392
Let's get out of the street.

1100
01:10:11,304 --> 01:10:13,295
I really can't imagine
you doing that.

1101
01:10:13,373 --> 01:10:15,068
What's that supposed to mean?

1102
01:10:15,142 --> 01:10:16,700
Well, you don't really seem

1103
01:10:16,776 --> 01:10:20,542
like the adventurous type,
you know?

1104
01:10:20,614 --> 01:10:23,913
Don't let the cable uniform,
you know, throw you.

1105
01:10:23,984 --> 01:10:27,112
I wasn't making assumptions.

1106
01:10:27,187 --> 01:10:28,586
I've made some
assumptions about you.

1107
01:10:28,655 --> 01:10:31,351
Oh, really?

1108
01:10:31,424 --> 01:10:32,482
And?

1109
01:10:35,729 --> 01:10:37,754
Well... you're just going
to have to wait and see.

1110
01:10:43,703 --> 01:10:45,898
Why wait?
Let's get a check.

1111
01:10:45,972 --> 01:10:47,166
Let's go back to my place.

1112
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:48,207
No assumptions...

1113
01:10:48,275 --> 01:10:49,799
Not tonight.
It's late.

1114
01:10:49,876 --> 01:10:50,843
I should go home.

1115
01:10:50,911 --> 01:10:53,937
What, you have
a cable company curfew?

1116
01:10:54,014 --> 01:10:54,981
No,

1117
01:10:55,048 --> 01:10:58,415
but I've made some
bad calls in the past.

1118
01:10:58,485 --> 01:10:59,679
Hey.

1119
01:10:59,753 --> 01:11:01,948
We should take this maybe a
little slower, you know?

1120
01:11:02,022 --> 01:11:04,752
This lovely dinner,
sparkling conversation...

1121
01:11:04,824 --> 01:11:05,848
you still don't trust me?

1122
01:11:05,926 --> 01:11:09,692
Oh, I trust everyone.

1123
01:11:09,763 --> 01:11:13,062
It's the devil inside them
I don't trust.

1124
01:11:17,537 --> 01:11:19,300
It's an interesting saying.

1125
01:11:19,372 --> 01:11:20,737
It's charming.
Where'd you pick that up?

1126
01:11:22,275 --> 01:11:23,207
Can't remember.

1127
01:11:23,276 --> 01:11:24,800
Really?

1128
01:11:24,878 --> 01:11:27,039
I knew a guy who said it
exactly like that.

1129
01:11:27,113 --> 01:11:28,205
Really?

1130
01:11:28,281 --> 01:11:30,681
Yeah. He's the only person
I've ever heard say that.

1131
01:11:30,750 --> 01:11:32,741
He said it all the time.

1132
01:11:32,819 --> 01:11:33,945
His name was John Bridger.

1133
01:11:35,322 --> 01:11:37,654
You're hurting my wrist.

1134
01:11:37,724 --> 01:11:40,090
He had a daughter
and she was about your age.

1135
01:11:43,797 --> 01:11:46,265
Let go of my wrist.

1136
01:11:46,333 --> 01:11:48,267
I knew that there was
something familiar about you.

1137
01:11:48,335 --> 01:11:51,498
You're exactly like
your old man, you know that?

1138
01:11:51,571 --> 01:11:54,233
I liked him, too,
right from the start.

1139
01:11:54,307 --> 01:11:56,172
I liked him right up
until the minute I shot him.

1140
01:11:58,878 --> 01:12:01,108
Who are you working with?

1141
01:12:05,852 --> 01:12:07,513
She's with us.

1142
01:12:19,299 --> 01:12:20,527
Gang's all here.

1143
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:23,364
You know, the only thing
worse than a thief, Bendel?

1144
01:12:23,436 --> 01:12:24,994
A coward.

1145
01:12:25,071 --> 01:12:26,095
Then you should have seen

1146
01:12:26,172 --> 01:12:27,833
the way your daddy
begged for his life.

1147
01:12:31,478 --> 01:12:32,467
It's not worth it.

1148
01:12:32,545 --> 01:12:33,637
Put a leash on your cat.

1149
01:12:39,252 --> 01:12:40,241
Hi, Steve.

1150
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:41,582
Charlie.

1151
01:12:43,356 --> 01:12:45,221
Not bad, Charlie.

1152
01:12:45,292 --> 01:12:46,281
Really, not bad.

1153
01:12:46,359 --> 01:12:48,486
You have no idea
how hard it is for me

1154
01:12:48,561 --> 01:12:50,290
not to reach across
this table and kill you

1155
01:12:50,363 --> 01:12:51,728
with my bare hands.

1156
01:12:51,798 --> 01:12:53,265
You know better than that,
Charlie.

1157
01:12:53,333 --> 01:12:55,824
Can't let emotion
into these things.

1158
01:12:55,902 --> 01:12:56,994
Tell me it wasn't about emotion

1159
01:12:57,070 --> 01:12:58,731
when you shot John
and left us all for dead.

1160
01:12:58,805 --> 01:13:00,534
That wasn't about emotion.

1161
01:13:00,607 --> 01:13:02,837
It was about a lot of gold,
and I wanted it.

1162
01:13:02,909 --> 01:13:04,774
Anything you think you
deserved, you didn't.

1163
01:13:04,844 --> 01:13:07,335
Hey, don't talk about right
and wrong with me, man,

1164
01:13:07,447 --> 01:13:09,005
'cause I just don't give a shit.

1165
01:13:09,082 --> 01:13:10,549
Okay?

1166
01:13:10,617 --> 01:13:13,279
You got your cards,
I got my cards,

1167
01:13:13,353 --> 01:13:15,821
we made our play,
and I came out on top, okay?

1168
01:13:15,889 --> 01:13:17,618
Now if you want to start
the game up again,

1169
01:13:17,691 --> 01:13:19,454
that's fine with me.

1170
01:13:19,526 --> 01:13:23,758
But what, I mean, what
is your play here, really?

1171
01:13:23,830 --> 01:13:25,730
I mean, come on, what do you...
what do you think?

1172
01:13:25,799 --> 01:13:28,734
Y-you'll try to take out
my guards, right?

1173
01:13:28,802 --> 01:13:31,737
I have five of them
that you don't know about.

1174
01:13:31,805 --> 01:13:34,103
You'll try to have
Lyle hack the system.

1175
01:13:34,174 --> 01:13:35,471
I'll change it again
tomorrow morning.

1176
01:13:35,542 --> 01:13:38,375
What, what, what was
y-your final move?

1177
01:13:38,478 --> 01:13:40,309
I mean, you were going
to have Bridger's daughter

1178
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:42,348
come in and try
to crack my safe?

1179
01:13:42,415 --> 01:13:45,748
I mean, that's...
that's very poetic and all,

1180
01:13:45,819 --> 01:13:47,377
but I just don't see it.

1181
01:13:47,454 --> 01:13:48,819
I don't think she'll get
anywhere near it.

1182
01:13:48,888 --> 01:13:50,549
Same old Steve, huh?

1183
01:13:50,623 --> 01:13:52,955
Always thinking defensively.

1184
01:13:53,026 --> 01:13:54,721
That's why you're
always number two.

1185
01:13:54,794 --> 01:13:56,853
How do you figure that?

1186
01:13:56,930 --> 01:13:58,397
You got no imagination.

1187
01:13:58,465 --> 01:14:00,797
Couldn't even decide what
to do with all that money.

1188
01:14:00,867 --> 01:14:02,892
You had to buy what
everybody else wanted.

1189
01:14:02,969 --> 01:14:05,335
Oh... well, try this on
in your imagination, okay?

1190
01:14:05,405 --> 01:14:06,497
That gold is already gone.

1191
01:14:06,573 --> 01:14:08,234
That's bullshit, Steve.

1192
01:14:08,308 --> 01:14:10,242
No, really, it's over Charlie.

1193
01:14:10,310 --> 01:14:12,244
I'm trying to move
the last two bricks.

1194
01:14:12,312 --> 01:14:14,906
You want to come after me
over a couple of lousy bricks?

1195
01:14:14,981 --> 01:14:17,040
I mean, really, be my guest.

1196
01:14:17,117 --> 01:14:18,846
But you're off to a bad start,
you know?

1197
01:14:18,918 --> 01:14:20,044
'Cause you just blew
the best thing

1198
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:21,052
you had going for you.

1199
01:14:21,121 --> 01:14:23,180
You just blew the element
of surprise.

1200
01:14:27,127 --> 01:14:28,424
Surprised?

1201
01:14:31,798 --> 01:14:32,856
It's over when I say it's over.

1202
01:14:36,836 --> 01:14:38,861
Are you all right, sir?

1203
01:15:10,703 --> 01:15:11,795
How you doing?

1204
01:15:14,007 --> 01:15:16,771
Good...

1205
01:15:16,843 --> 01:15:19,573
considering...

1206
01:15:19,646 --> 01:15:22,012
considering the fact
that I'm doing all of this

1207
01:15:22,081 --> 01:15:23,343
for a man I barely knew.

1208
01:15:30,623 --> 01:15:35,686
You know what bothered me
all those years, Charlie?

1209
01:15:35,762 --> 01:15:39,198
It was that, whenever
he'd call me to tell me

1210
01:15:39,265 --> 01:15:41,233
that he was on some job,

1211
01:15:41,301 --> 01:15:44,862
I knew you were right there
with him.

1212
01:15:48,041 --> 01:15:50,703
You got to know him
a lot better than I did.

1213
01:15:52,779 --> 01:15:54,576
Just 'cause he was around
me more doesn't mean

1214
01:15:54,647 --> 01:15:56,308
he wasn't thinking
about you all the time.

1215
01:15:56,382 --> 01:15:58,748
Be nice if it was true.

1216
01:15:58,818 --> 01:16:00,080
It is true.

1217
01:16:00,153 --> 01:16:02,053
He always regretted
not having been

1218
01:16:02,121 --> 01:16:04,112
a good enough father
to you, Stella.

1219
01:16:06,993 --> 01:16:08,426
How do you know that?

1220
01:16:08,495 --> 01:16:10,895
Because he told me.

1221
01:16:17,570 --> 01:16:18,798
What did you do to your hand?

1222
01:16:23,142 --> 01:16:24,131
I punched Steve.

1223
01:16:24,210 --> 01:16:27,475
Why do you get to punch him
and I don't?

1224
01:16:30,550 --> 01:16:31,915
Those hands are
way too valuable.

1225
01:16:39,893 --> 01:16:41,258
Hey.

1226
01:16:46,866 --> 01:16:48,731
Okay?

1227
01:16:57,443 --> 01:16:59,070
There'll be nothing left
of that if you keep rubbing it.

1228
01:17:05,585 --> 01:17:08,577
Tell Mr. Frazelli
we'll see him at 8:00.

1229
01:17:08,655 --> 01:17:09,849
Charlie!

1230
01:17:12,525 --> 01:17:13,583
He's flying the coop.

1231
01:17:14,894 --> 01:17:16,054
When?

1232
01:17:16,129 --> 01:17:17,596
His security guard called

1233
01:17:17,664 --> 01:17:19,825
for a private helicopter
at 4:00 PM.

1234
01:17:19,899 --> 01:17:22,493
There's an armored car service
coming to his house at 5:00.

1235
01:17:22,569 --> 01:17:26,335
There is a cargo plane scheduled
to depart LAX at 8:00 PM

1236
01:17:26,406 --> 01:17:27,338
to Mexico City.

1237
01:17:27,407 --> 01:17:30,843
What if he's moving the safe
as a diversion?

1238
01:17:30,910 --> 01:17:32,605
We crack it, it's empty,
the gold's somewhere else.

1239
01:17:32,679 --> 01:17:34,738
Steve's not about to let
that gold out of his sight.

1240
01:17:34,814 --> 01:17:35,940
It's going to be in that truck

1241
01:17:36,015 --> 01:17:37,243
and he's going to be watching it

1242
01:17:37,317 --> 01:17:39,012
every step of the way
from the helicopter.

1243
01:17:39,085 --> 01:17:40,814
So the gold's headed to Mexico.

1244
01:17:40,887 --> 01:17:41,854
Who knows where?

1245
01:17:41,921 --> 01:17:43,013
They could change
the flight plan in midair.

1246
01:17:43,089 --> 01:17:44,021
Slow down, slow down.

1247
01:17:44,090 --> 01:17:44,954
You guys are looking at this
the wrong way.

1248
01:17:45,024 --> 01:17:46,048
This is good news for us.

1249
01:17:46,125 --> 01:17:48,355
Charlie, what do you
mean, "good news"?

1250
01:17:48,461 --> 01:17:50,258
We've been trying to get
to the gold in the safe,

1251
01:17:50,330 --> 01:17:51,524
now the safe is coming to us.

1252
01:17:51,598 --> 01:17:52,929
We're going to boost it
in transit.

1253
01:17:52,999 --> 01:17:53,931
Charlie, it could take

1254
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,126
a dozen different routes
to the airport.

1255
01:17:55,201 --> 01:17:56,896
We have no idea which one.

1256
01:17:56,970 --> 01:17:59,200
We can't take out an armored
truck during rush hour.

1257
01:17:59,272 --> 01:18:00,239
We're already set up to do it.

1258
01:18:00,306 --> 01:18:01,705
Napster,

1259
01:18:01,774 --> 01:18:05,801
gridlock every route
except for the one we choose.

1260
01:18:05,878 --> 01:18:08,073
Force that truck to go
exactly where we want it to go.

1261
01:18:08,147 --> 01:18:09,307
Where do we want it to go?

1262
01:18:09,449 --> 01:18:11,940
We can't have a shoot-out
with armed guards. We'd lose.

1263
01:18:12,018 --> 01:18:14,418
We do it like the Italian job.

1264
01:18:20,627 --> 01:18:21,616
Hello?

1265
01:18:21,694 --> 01:18:22,956
Why'd you do it?

1266
01:18:23,029 --> 01:18:23,859
Do what?

1267
01:18:23,930 --> 01:18:24,658
Yevhen.

1268
01:18:24,731 --> 01:18:26,426
You didn't have to clip him.

1269
01:18:26,499 --> 01:18:27,466
Whoa, whoa.
What are you talking about?

1270
01:18:27,533 --> 01:18:28,465
We didn't clip anybody.

1271
01:18:28,534 --> 01:18:29,558
Yevhen's cousin is under

1272
01:18:29,636 --> 01:18:32,298
the distinct impression
that you did.

1273
01:18:32,372 --> 01:18:33,430
Why does he think that?

1274
01:18:33,506 --> 01:18:34,666
Because you want to know

1275
01:18:34,741 --> 01:18:36,675
about the gold
with the Balinese dancer.

1276
01:18:36,743 --> 01:18:38,005
You told him that?

1277
01:18:38,077 --> 01:18:39,339
Listen to me, man.

1278
01:18:39,479 --> 01:18:41,242
If there's one thing that I know

1279
01:18:41,314 --> 01:18:43,282
is never to mess
with Mother Nature,

1280
01:18:43,349 --> 01:18:45,909
mother-in-laws
or mother-freakin' Ukrainians.

1281
01:18:45,985 --> 01:18:49,546
Look, I need a favor.

1282
01:19:15,581 --> 01:19:16,639
Yeah.

1283
01:19:16,716 --> 01:19:17,808
Had a hiccup last night.

1284
01:19:17,884 --> 01:19:18,816
Could use some help.

1285
01:19:18,885 --> 01:19:19,977
Want hands-on this time.

1286
01:19:20,053 --> 01:19:21,315
You interested?

1287
01:19:21,387 --> 01:19:22,319
Could be.

1288
01:19:22,388 --> 01:19:24,618
But I don't like
to be kept in the dark.

1289
01:19:24,691 --> 01:19:27,057
If I'm in, I'm in.

1290
01:19:27,126 --> 01:19:29,287
Okay, you're in.

1291
01:19:29,362 --> 01:19:30,590
All right.

1292
01:19:33,399 --> 01:19:34,798
What do you think, Charlie?

1293
01:19:34,867 --> 01:19:35,856
This'll work.

1294
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:37,402
Let's go.

1295
01:19:48,281 --> 01:19:49,680
You're amazing.

1296
01:19:49,749 --> 01:19:51,148
It's a work of genius.

1297
01:19:51,217 --> 01:19:52,184
Uh-huh.

1298
01:20:00,927 --> 01:20:02,895
You okay?

1299
01:20:02,962 --> 01:20:03,894
Just give me a moment.

1300
01:20:03,963 --> 01:20:05,089
Now?

1301
01:20:05,164 --> 01:20:08,327
I'm about to insert this pin
into this detonator tube,

1302
01:20:08,401 --> 01:20:10,369
and if the brass touches
the sides,

1303
01:20:10,503 --> 01:20:12,994
we'll both be the last people
we ever see.

1304
01:20:15,842 --> 01:20:17,673
Take all the time you need.

1305
01:20:20,747 --> 01:20:22,305
Hey, Charlie.

1306
01:20:22,381 --> 01:20:25,373
What?

1307
01:20:25,485 --> 01:20:28,852
I love you, man.

1308
01:20:28,921 --> 01:20:31,219
I love you, too.

1309
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:36,854
Okay.
Okay.

1310
01:20:47,273 --> 01:20:49,036
Your attention, please.

1311
01:20:49,108 --> 01:20:50,939
Metrolink train number 774
will arrive

1312
01:20:51,010 --> 01:20:52,773
in approximately 15 minutes.

1313
01:21:09,729 --> 01:21:11,287
Check positions.

1314
01:21:11,364 --> 01:21:12,353
Napster?

1315
01:21:12,465 --> 01:21:15,298
I'm in position.

1316
01:21:15,368 --> 01:21:16,892
Handsome Rob?

1317
01:21:16,969 --> 01:21:18,163
We're in position.

1318
01:21:18,237 --> 01:21:20,262
Everything's quiet, Charlie.

1319
01:21:23,342 --> 01:21:25,333
Wrench?

1320
01:21:25,411 --> 01:21:27,072
Set.

1321
01:21:43,329 --> 01:21:44,990
Charlie, we got
an uninvited visitor.

1322
01:21:45,064 --> 01:21:47,726
Some motorcycle guard
following the truck.

1323
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:48,767
We'll deal with it.

1324
01:21:55,174 --> 01:21:56,869
Who are these cats?

1325
01:21:56,943 --> 01:21:58,001
What's wrong?

1326
01:21:58,077 --> 01:22:00,045
Charlie, you won't believe this.

1327
01:22:00,112 --> 01:22:02,171
He's brought in
three armored trucks.

1328
01:22:02,248 --> 01:22:05,809
It's a shell game.
Shell game now.

1329
01:22:05,885 --> 01:22:07,614
Well, boss,
I can't reroute the truck

1330
01:22:07,687 --> 01:22:09,518
if I don't know which truck
to reroute.

1331
01:22:09,589 --> 01:22:11,352
Just go with the one
Steve follows in the helicopter.

1332
01:22:11,457 --> 01:22:14,722
Remember, he said he'd never let
that gold out of his sight.

1333
01:22:14,794 --> 01:22:16,853
Unless he's playing us,
and he is.

1334
01:22:28,174 --> 01:22:29,869
Okay, let's go!

1335
01:22:29,942 --> 01:22:31,933
Moving out!

1336
01:22:44,590 --> 01:22:46,182
Here we go.

1337
01:22:46,259 --> 01:22:47,886
They're pulling out.

1338
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:49,587
Napster,

1339
01:22:49,662 --> 01:22:52,563
pull up the traffic cameras
you're watching.

1340
01:22:52,632 --> 01:22:55,362
Where's the first camera
the trucks go past?

1341
01:22:58,404 --> 01:23:01,100
Vine and Yucca; they're all
going to cross there.

1342
01:23:01,173 --> 01:23:03,368
See which one's riding low.

1343
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:15,753
First one is...

1344
01:23:18,224 --> 01:23:19,953
First two are the same, so...

1345
01:23:24,163 --> 01:23:27,030
Houston, we have our truck.
It is number 128.

1346
01:23:35,908 --> 01:23:37,933
We're moving out.

1347
01:23:39,445 --> 01:23:41,310
Three-kilo-bob
to two-fox-mike,

1348
01:23:41,380 --> 01:23:42,608
we're heading to the airport.

1349
01:23:57,196 --> 01:24:01,155
Okay, guys, truck 128
has turned right heading west.

1350
01:24:01,233 --> 01:24:02,928
Gridlock time.

1351
01:24:04,503 --> 01:24:08,132
Mr. Scott, pick up
a courtesy telephone please.

1352
01:24:08,207 --> 01:24:10,072
Mr. Scott, pick up a courtesy...

1353
01:24:12,078 --> 01:24:14,012
We've crashed.

1354
01:24:15,815 --> 01:24:17,749
It's not a crash.

1355
01:24:18,918 --> 01:24:20,317
We've got power.

1356
01:24:21,387 --> 01:24:23,184
I can't log in.

1357
01:24:23,255 --> 01:24:27,658
They are about to hit a major
detour and be sent your way.

1358
01:24:34,567 --> 01:24:35,534
Oops.

1359
01:24:40,039 --> 01:24:43,304
You'll... never... shut down...

1360
01:24:43,376 --> 01:24:46,140
the real... Napster.

1361
01:24:53,853 --> 01:24:55,218
What's your problem?!

1362
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:03,460
Truck 128,
what is your progress?

1363
01:25:03,529 --> 01:25:05,292
This is truck 128.

1364
01:25:05,364 --> 01:25:07,127
Traffic's out of control here.

1365
01:25:07,199 --> 01:25:09,133
We've got to look
for another route.

1366
01:25:09,201 --> 01:25:12,568
Check the police band.

1367
01:25:12,638 --> 01:25:14,572
Okay, I'm opening up
a space on Highland.

1368
01:25:18,911 --> 01:25:20,310
Oh, get us out of here.

1369
01:25:20,379 --> 01:25:21,471
I'm trying.

1370
01:25:26,318 --> 01:25:28,479
And he's taking it.

1371
01:25:34,126 --> 01:25:35,855
Police scanners are saying
computers are down

1372
01:25:35,928 --> 01:25:36,917
at Traffic Control Center.

1373
01:25:36,996 --> 01:25:40,056
Nice, Charlie.

1374
01:25:40,132 --> 01:25:42,362
What are you up to?

1375
01:25:42,435 --> 01:25:44,699
Go back.

1376
01:25:52,812 --> 01:25:55,110
I now command you to turn left.

1377
01:25:57,083 --> 01:25:58,573
Come on, take the left.

1378
01:26:00,753 --> 01:26:02,084
Yeah, you did.

1379
01:26:02,154 --> 01:26:03,712
You did.

1380
01:26:38,257 --> 01:26:39,588
Give us the flag.

1381
01:26:39,658 --> 01:26:41,649
Metro just passed through
the station.

1382
01:26:41,727 --> 01:26:43,752
You are clear for 90 seconds.

1383
01:26:43,829 --> 01:26:44,955
Go.

1384
01:27:01,147 --> 01:27:01,806
Come on, Steve.

1385
01:27:18,831 --> 01:27:19,695
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1386
01:27:23,936 --> 01:27:26,632
Look out!
Look out!

1387
01:27:26,705 --> 01:27:27,672
30 seconds and counting.

1388
01:27:35,247 --> 01:27:36,578
15 seconds,
you're either blocked in

1389
01:27:36,649 --> 01:27:37,775
or you're paint on the train.

1390
01:27:43,756 --> 01:27:44,723
Go, go, come on, come on!

1391
01:27:45,991 --> 01:27:47,515
Stay right on me,
this is gonna be tight.

1392
01:27:54,567 --> 01:27:56,000
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

1393
01:27:56,068 --> 01:27:58,002
You're gonna stop right there.

1394
01:28:36,408 --> 01:28:37,875
Okay, guys.

1395
01:28:37,943 --> 01:28:39,342
Coming into position.

1396
01:28:39,445 --> 01:28:40,742
Stay cool.

1397
01:28:52,791 --> 01:28:54,122
Ten...

1398
01:28:54,193 --> 01:28:56,252
nine...

1399
01:28:56,328 --> 01:28:58,057
eight...

1400
01:28:58,130 --> 01:28:59,859
seven...

1401
01:28:59,932 --> 01:29:01,263
six...

1402
01:29:01,333 --> 01:29:02,960
five...

1403
01:29:03,035 --> 01:29:04,730
four...

1404
01:29:04,803 --> 01:29:05,565
Don't lose 'em,
don't lose 'em,

1405
01:29:05,638 --> 01:29:07,071
- Don't lose them.
- Three...

1406
01:29:07,139 --> 01:29:09,073
two...

1407
01:29:09,141 --> 01:29:10,802
one.

1408
01:29:32,398 --> 01:29:33,990
Damn.

1409
01:29:40,239 --> 01:29:41,797
Where's my truck?

1410
01:29:41,874 --> 01:29:44,399
What...? What the fuck
happened to my truck?!

1411
01:29:48,847 --> 01:29:50,747
It just blew right through
the street.

1412
01:29:50,816 --> 01:29:52,249
Well, get under there.

1413
01:30:02,995 --> 01:30:05,691
We have another problem, guys.

1414
01:30:05,764 --> 01:30:06,560
What?

1415
01:30:07,700 --> 01:30:09,531
This isn't the Worthington 1000.

1416
01:30:09,601 --> 01:30:10,465
What?

1417
01:30:11,770 --> 01:30:13,362
He switched safes on us.

1418
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:16,034
Can you do it?

1419
01:30:16,108 --> 01:30:17,473
It's Israeli made.

1420
01:30:17,543 --> 01:30:19,170
It's got a glass re-lock system.

1421
01:30:19,244 --> 01:30:21,371
There's a pane of glass
right here behind this door.

1422
01:30:21,480 --> 01:30:23,175
And if I don't drill perfectly
through that hole,

1423
01:30:23,248 --> 01:30:25,113
steel rods snap into place

1424
01:30:25,184 --> 01:30:26,344
and you can't open the safe.

1425
01:30:26,418 --> 01:30:28,113
And then we're up shit creek.

1426
01:30:57,449 --> 01:31:00,976
I think I just
cracked the glass.

1427
01:31:02,154 --> 01:31:04,054
I don't think it broke though.

1428
01:31:04,123 --> 01:31:06,921
I can't drill it again.

1429
01:31:06,992 --> 01:31:09,517
I have to do it by touch.

1430
01:31:11,930 --> 01:31:13,090
I can't get through.

1431
01:31:13,165 --> 01:31:14,689
The train's blocking the tunnel.

1432
01:31:14,767 --> 01:31:16,632
Where does the Metro rail
come above ground?

1433
01:31:16,702 --> 01:31:17,669
11th and Fig.

1434
01:31:17,736 --> 01:31:19,363
Positions two and three,

1435
01:31:19,438 --> 01:31:21,235
meet at 11th and Figueroa
and double back

1436
01:31:21,306 --> 01:31:22,364
to Hollywood and Highland.

1437
01:31:22,441 --> 01:31:24,033
Hurry up!

1438
01:31:38,757 --> 01:31:40,725
Your attention please.

1439
01:31:40,793 --> 01:31:42,784
Baggage for train number 22

1440
01:31:42,861 --> 01:31:45,091
is now available
at carousel number four.

1441
01:31:45,164 --> 01:31:48,065
Baggage for train number 22
is now available

1442
01:31:48,133 --> 01:31:49,862
at carousel number four.

1443
01:32:23,302 --> 01:32:25,236
I can't do this, Charlie.

1444
01:32:25,304 --> 01:32:26,236
Stella...

1445
01:32:26,305 --> 01:32:27,363
I can't do it...
I need a drill,

1446
01:32:27,506 --> 01:32:28,666
a borescope, something.

1447
01:32:28,740 --> 01:32:30,105
- I need to...
- You don't need any of that.

1448
01:32:30,175 --> 01:32:31,506
Come on, Charlie.

1449
01:32:31,577 --> 01:32:33,738
Hey, you can do this.

1450
01:33:28,867 --> 01:33:30,061
Slide.

1451
01:33:30,135 --> 01:33:31,432
Come on, come on.

1452
01:33:37,976 --> 01:33:39,500
Hey.

1453
01:33:39,578 --> 01:33:42,741
Don't you want to see
what's inside?

1454
01:33:42,814 --> 01:33:43,906
Absolutely.

1455
01:33:47,219 --> 01:33:48,709
Napster.

1456
01:33:48,787 --> 01:33:49,719
Yeah?

1457
01:33:49,788 --> 01:33:51,813
13 across, four high, four deep.

1458
01:33:53,458 --> 01:33:55,892
That's, uh, 208 bricks.

1459
01:33:55,961 --> 01:33:57,121
How much?

1460
01:33:57,195 --> 01:33:59,561
Oh. Uh, 208 times...

1461
01:34:03,035 --> 01:34:04,502
2.7... 2.7 million.

1462
01:34:04,570 --> 01:34:05,298
What?

1463
01:34:06,371 --> 01:34:07,497
No, it's 27.

1464
01:34:07,573 --> 01:34:08,938
That's 27 million.

1465
01:34:09,007 --> 01:34:10,941
That's $27 million
worth of gold.

1466
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:18,306
Yeah!

1467
01:34:18,383 --> 01:34:22,285
Got the... holy spirit.

1468
01:34:22,354 --> 01:34:24,788
You should get on it.
It's a good train.

1469
01:35:02,060 --> 01:35:03,527
What did you think, John?

1470
01:35:11,670 --> 01:35:13,194
27 million.

1471
01:35:13,271 --> 01:35:14,704
Say it again.

1472
01:35:14,773 --> 01:35:17,071
- 27 million.
- Say it again.

1473
01:35:17,142 --> 01:35:19,076
- Say it again!
- 27 million.

1474
01:35:19,144 --> 01:35:20,304
Say it again!

1475
01:35:43,835 --> 01:35:45,530
Two motorcycles on us, Charlie.

1476
01:35:48,874 --> 01:35:50,535
I've got three Minis
in the storm drain

1477
01:35:50,609 --> 01:35:52,167
heading east towards
the L.A. River.

1478
01:35:52,244 --> 01:35:53,836
Stop them before they get
to the street.

1479
01:35:58,850 --> 01:35:59,874
Shit!

1480
01:36:04,156 --> 01:36:04,747
Whoa!

1481
01:36:19,037 --> 01:36:19,901
Here we go.

1482
01:36:29,147 --> 01:36:29,772
Whoo!

1483
01:36:31,883 --> 01:36:32,406
Whoa! Whoa!

1484
01:36:35,153 --> 01:36:35,744
Open your door.

1485
01:36:41,093 --> 01:36:43,186
Come on, guys, we're moving.

1486
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:49,867
There, there, there, there,
there, there.

1487
01:36:59,511 --> 01:37:02,139
Hey, come on, come on, look out.

1488
01:37:29,441 --> 01:37:31,068
Come on!

1489
01:37:37,849 --> 01:37:40,079
Where you going?
Where you going?

1490
01:37:59,504 --> 01:38:00,368
I'm going to take Steve.

1491
01:38:00,438 --> 01:38:01,530
You guys go straight
to Union Station.

1492
01:38:01,606 --> 01:38:02,800
I'll meet you there.

1493
01:38:04,042 --> 01:38:05,600
Stay on him.
Stay on him!

1494
01:38:14,052 --> 01:38:16,145
Okay, Charlie, I'm opening up
a spot on lower Grand.

1495
01:38:19,658 --> 01:38:21,319
I know it's you, Charlie.

1496
01:38:23,328 --> 01:38:24,317
Take your next left.

1497
01:39:24,055 --> 01:39:25,352
Nice move, Steve.

1498
01:40:03,762 --> 01:40:04,820
Get out!

1499
01:40:04,896 --> 01:40:06,727
- Get out!
- Okay.

1500
01:40:06,798 --> 01:40:08,322
I said get out!

1501
01:41:43,161 --> 01:41:44,093
They got a bunch of cars

1502
01:41:44,162 --> 01:41:45,754
in there, right?
Mini Coopers?

1503
01:41:45,830 --> 01:41:47,821
Look, look, man...

1504
01:41:47,899 --> 01:41:50,299
- I don't know anything...
- Hey, don't worry about them.

1505
01:41:50,368 --> 01:41:52,768
I'll give you five grand
you put me inside that car.

1506
01:41:57,275 --> 01:41:59,641
Buy your girlfriend
something nice.

1507
01:42:04,282 --> 01:42:05,943
Come on.

1508
01:42:11,723 --> 01:42:13,782
Half now, half when
you help me unload.

1509
01:42:18,730 --> 01:42:20,857
I've got to hand it
to you, Steve.

1510
01:42:20,932 --> 01:42:24,163
You actually played this one
pretty smart.

1511
01:42:24,235 --> 01:42:26,863
Decoy trucks...
you switched safes.

1512
01:42:26,938 --> 01:42:28,132
The helicopter routine,

1513
01:42:28,206 --> 01:42:29,969
I mean, that was
pretty damn good.

1514
01:42:30,041 --> 01:42:33,636
But now I've got the gold...
and you, you've got nothing.

1515
01:42:33,711 --> 01:42:34,473
I got this.

1516
01:42:34,546 --> 01:42:35,740
So cut the crap,

1517
01:42:35,814 --> 01:42:37,509
and give me my goddamn gold!

1518
01:42:51,596 --> 01:42:53,530
Who the hell are you?

1519
01:42:53,598 --> 01:42:55,395
I am Mashkov...

1520
01:42:55,500 --> 01:42:57,400
and you killed my cousin Yevhen.

1521
01:42:57,502 --> 01:42:59,436
Got to have some insurance,
Steve.

1522
01:43:08,913 --> 01:43:10,574
Yevhen was already dead
when I got there.

1523
01:43:10,648 --> 01:43:12,673
I'm sorry about that,
but Yevhen dealt with

1524
01:43:12,750 --> 01:43:13,910
a lot of unsavory people.

1525
01:43:13,985 --> 01:43:15,646
Now, this guy's
trying to play you.

1526
01:43:15,720 --> 01:43:17,711
You are right...

1527
01:43:17,789 --> 01:43:19,723
no imagination.

1528
01:43:22,527 --> 01:43:24,085
There's a lot of gold in there.

1529
01:43:24,162 --> 01:43:25,686
We're the only ones with guns.

1530
01:43:25,763 --> 01:43:27,162
I'll make you a good deal.

1531
01:43:35,240 --> 01:43:37,105
I've already made my deal.

1532
01:43:42,413 --> 01:43:43,778
What do you want?

1533
01:43:43,848 --> 01:43:46,112
You know this was
never about the gold.

1534
01:43:46,184 --> 01:43:48,345
Whatever helps you
sleep at night, sweetheart.

1535
01:43:52,757 --> 01:43:54,384
Bitch!

1536
01:43:54,492 --> 01:43:56,187
Charlie! Come on, Charlie!

1537
01:43:57,795 --> 01:43:58,921
Okay.

1538
01:44:02,367 --> 01:44:03,629
Wait a minute
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1539
01:44:03,701 --> 01:44:05,293
Wait a minute. I'll double
whatever he's giving you.

1540
01:44:05,370 --> 01:44:06,302
Just don't shoot me.

1541
01:44:06,371 --> 01:44:08,532
Don't worry, I'm not
going to shoot you.

1542
01:44:08,606 --> 01:44:11,598
No, I'm going to take you
to my workplace.

1543
01:44:11,676 --> 01:44:13,507
I think you would be
very interested

1544
01:44:13,578 --> 01:44:15,170
in some of the machinery I use.

1545
01:44:18,082 --> 01:44:19,049
No, come on.

1546
01:44:24,622 --> 01:44:25,680
Guys.

1547
01:44:25,757 --> 01:44:27,884
I want to make a toast.

1548
01:44:27,959 --> 01:44:29,358
To John Bridger,

1549
01:44:29,427 --> 01:44:32,089
the most brilliant
master planner of all.

1550
01:44:32,163 --> 01:44:34,097
Father and friend.

1551
01:44:34,165 --> 01:44:35,189
To my dad.

1552
01:44:40,171 --> 01:44:41,365
Stella was right.

1553
01:44:41,439 --> 01:44:42,906
It wasn't about the money.

1554
01:44:42,974 --> 01:44:44,464
Of course that
didn't stop the guys

1555
01:44:44,542 --> 01:44:45,873
from having a little bit of fun.

1556
01:44:45,944 --> 01:44:47,878
<i>Money!</i>

1557
01:44:47,946 --> 01:44:50,380
Handsome Rob
got his Aston Martin.

1558
01:44:51,983 --> 01:44:54,918
<i>Get a good job with good pay...</i>

1559
01:44:54,986 --> 01:44:57,216
He took it
for a ride to break it in.

1560
01:44:59,457 --> 01:45:05,828
<i>Money, it's a gas</i>

1561
01:45:05,897 --> 01:45:11,096
Grab that cash with both hands
<i>and make a stash</i>

1562
01:45:11,169 --> 01:45:12,659
He got off with a warning.

1563
01:45:12,737 --> 01:45:16,332
New car, caviar,
four star daydream

1564
01:45:16,407 --> 01:45:18,967
Left Ear got his dream house
in the south of Spain

1565
01:45:19,043 --> 01:45:22,012
with a room just for his shoes.

1566
01:45:22,080 --> 01:45:23,138
Buenos dias.

1567
01:45:23,214 --> 01:45:26,342
Buenos dias.

<i>Money, get back</i>

1569
01:45:30,622 --> 01:45:33,022
Lyle finally made the cover
of Wired Magazine.

1570
01:45:33,091 --> 01:45:37,551
<i>I'm all right, Jack, keep
your hands off of my stack</i>

1573
01:45:40,231 --> 01:45:41,357
Yes, I am.

1574
01:45:41,432 --> 01:45:43,366
And he got that
kick-ass stereo he wanted.

1575
01:45:43,501 --> 01:45:47,562
Uh, would you listen
to something for me?

1576
01:45:47,639 --> 01:45:48,765
With speakers so loud

1577
01:45:48,840 --> 01:45:51,035
they'd blow
a woman's clothes off.

And me?

1583
01:46:13,398 --> 01:46:16,333
I took John Bridger's advice.

1584
01:46:16,401 --> 01:46:19,666
I found somebody I want to spend
the rest of my life with

1585
01:46:19,737 --> 01:46:21,329
and I'm gonna hold on
