2
00:01:32,122 --> 00:01:34,283
My talons are upon you!

3
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:37,450
Your days of terrorizing
the owl kingdoms are over!

4
00:01:37,627 --> 00:01:41,358
Not so fast! You're no match
for my army of Evil Ones.

5
00:01:41,531 --> 00:01:43,123
Ha, ha! Well, perhaps.

6
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,461
- But I am Lyze of Kiel.
- Soren, but...

7
00:01:45,635 --> 00:01:49,127
And I have assembled my own army,
the Guardians of Ga'Hoole!

8
00:01:49,306 --> 00:01:50,398
But, Soren...

9
00:01:50,574 --> 00:01:54,476
We've sworn an oath to make strong the
weak, mend the broken, and vanquish evil!

10
00:01:56,346 --> 00:01:58,075
Eglantine, what is it?

11
00:01:58,248 --> 00:02:02,309
Soren, this time you said
I would be Lyze of Kiel.

12
00:02:02,486 --> 00:02:04,420
Oh, come on. Look, next go, all right?

13
00:02:04,588 --> 00:02:08,183
Well, I hope you're not lying...

14
00:02:08,358 --> 00:02:10,758
...to Metal Beak!

15
00:02:11,528 --> 00:02:12,688
Got you!

16
00:02:13,163 --> 00:02:15,757
My beak. Da.

17
00:02:15,966 --> 00:02:19,094
Okay. Enough, young owlets.
Time for bed.

18
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:22,102
Yes, please.
Enough stories about the Guardians.

19
00:02:22,272 --> 00:02:25,605
Now, Kludd, stories are part
of our culture and our history.

20
00:02:25,776 --> 00:02:27,004
We learn from them.

21
00:02:27,177 --> 00:02:29,441
Even after the 7ooth time
we hear them?

22
00:02:29,613 --> 00:02:33,913
Yes, even then. Unless, son, you
already know all there is of our history.

23
00:02:34,084 --> 00:02:35,551
I know the Guardians win.

24
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:38,017
- Soren, iùs just a story.
- It is not!

25
00:02:38,188 --> 00:02:39,348
Here we go again.

26
00:02:39,523 --> 00:02:42,253
I mean, Da, have you ever seen
a Guardian?

27
00:02:42,426 --> 00:02:45,862
Kludd, just because you can't
see something doesn't mean it isn't real.

28
00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:48,927
Iùs like feeling something
with your gizzard.

29
00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:50,760
You know, through our gizzards...

30
00:02:50,934 --> 00:02:53,767
...the voices of the ages whisper to us
and tell us whaùs right.

31
00:02:55,138 --> 00:02:56,969
Now, thaùs enough for one night, dear.

32
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,574
Tomorrow's a big day.
Iùs first branching.

33
00:02:59,743 --> 00:03:02,576
- Now, off to bed.
- Now, come along, children.

34
00:03:02,746 --> 00:03:06,580
I've made the moss and down
extra soft for you, Eglantine.

35
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,208
Soren, do you really think
Metal Beak is real?

36
00:03:10,387 --> 00:03:14,949
You remember,
it was the Battle of the Ice claws.

37
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:18,993
The Guardians were outnumbered.
Things looked dark.

38
00:03:19,729 --> 00:03:21,788
But then Lyze of Kiel...

39
00:03:21,965 --> 00:03:24,559
...struck down the leader
of the evil owls.

40
00:03:26,636 --> 00:03:28,331
The Guardians were victorious.

41
00:03:28,538 --> 00:03:31,473
The owl kingdoms were free once more.

42
00:03:31,641 --> 00:03:36,374
<i>And then they returned home,
to the Great Tree of Ga'Hoole.</i>

43
00:03:36,546 --> 00:03:37,570
Wow.

44
00:03:37,747 --> 00:03:41,012
But some say the evil king still lives...

45
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:45,848
...and wears a metal mask
to hide his missing beak.

46
00:03:47,023 --> 00:03:48,786
Stop! You're gonna give her daymares.

47
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,756
But this is my favorite part.

48
00:03:50,927 --> 00:03:53,418
I know. We've heard it a thousand times.

49
00:03:53,597 --> 00:03:55,030
You have a soft head, Soren.

50
00:03:55,198 --> 00:03:58,634
I think Da has filled it
with stories and dreams.

51
00:03:58,802 --> 00:04:00,793
There's nothing wrong with dreams.

52
00:04:00,971 --> 00:04:04,168
Thaùs the difference between us.
I have mine when I'm asleep.

53
00:04:04,341 --> 00:04:05,831
Now would you just go to sleep?

54
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,671
Soren...

55
00:04:10,347 --> 00:04:13,680
...Da says our dreams are who we are.

56
00:04:28,999 --> 00:04:31,661
- So as I was... Kludd, wait!
- No!

57
00:04:31,835 --> 00:04:33,359
Look, Da!

58
00:04:33,537 --> 00:04:34,970
I'm gonna be the best flier.

59
00:04:35,138 --> 00:04:37,936
Thaùs because Tytos are best
at everything.

60
00:04:38,108 --> 00:04:39,473
Right, Da?

61
00:04:39,643 --> 00:04:44,671
You have strength, Kludd. But owls make
the best hunters for one reason alone.

62
00:04:44,848 --> 00:04:48,306
Yeah, I know. Their silent flight.
By the time I have my claws out...

63
00:04:48,485 --> 00:04:51,852
The mice will have run away. And you
and your hatchlings will go hungry.

64
00:04:52,022 --> 00:04:53,216
Da!

65
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,414
I'm ready.

66
00:04:54,624 --> 00:04:55,955
Young Guardian...

67
00:04:56,126 --> 00:04:58,890
...I don't think your first branching lesson
will be that dangerous.

68
00:04:59,429 --> 00:05:02,262
Now, don't worry how much noise
you make in the beginning.

69
00:05:02,432 --> 00:05:04,696
You just need to stretch your...

70
00:05:04,935 --> 00:05:06,197
...wings.

71
00:05:07,237 --> 00:05:08,397
Well done.

72
00:05:08,572 --> 00:05:09,869
Beginner's luck.

73
00:05:19,382 --> 00:05:22,681
You know, Kludd, it helps when
I picture where I'm gonna land.

74
00:05:22,852 --> 00:05:24,376
Come on, I'll race you!

75
00:05:24,554 --> 00:05:25,714
Okay. Go!

76
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:30,157
Yeah, you had a head start.

77
00:05:30,327 --> 00:05:32,454
- No, I didn't!
- Yeah, you did. Da, he cheated.

78
00:05:32,662 --> 00:05:34,254
Boys. No more fighting.

79
00:05:34,431 --> 00:05:38,094
- Leùs get the boys inside. Iùs time to go.
- Can we come with you on the hunt?

80
00:05:38,268 --> 00:05:42,102
Not tonight. But when the time comes,
at least you'll have the helmet for it.

81
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,935
- Nice helmet.
- Get off!

82
00:05:45,108 --> 00:05:46,132
Boys.

83
00:05:46,309 --> 00:05:48,072
Do it again. Say it again.

84
00:05:50,113 --> 00:05:54,277
Noctus, I know Soren's a bit of a dreamer.
Do you worry for him?

85
00:05:54,451 --> 00:05:56,282
I worry for both of them.

86
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,645
Seems like yesterday
they were hatchlings...

87
00:05:58,822 --> 00:06:02,849
...and now, well, you know, they'll
soon be grown and leaving the hollow.

88
00:06:03,693 --> 00:06:05,752
I just want them to be prepared.

89
00:06:05,929 --> 00:06:08,796
They'll be fine.

90
00:06:09,065 --> 00:06:11,226
Come on.

91
00:06:29,152 --> 00:06:30,744
Eglantine, are you all right?

92
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,410
Oh, iùs all right, dear.

93
00:06:32,722 --> 00:06:35,316
If it wants to come out, let it.

94
00:06:36,459 --> 00:06:39,087
Thaùs it, dear. Thaùs it. Keep going.

95
00:06:39,262 --> 00:06:41,287
Oh, iùs going to be beautiful!

96
00:06:42,732 --> 00:06:45,223
- There you go.
- Eg, hat is gross!

97
00:06:45,402 --> 00:06:46,460
Quite an achievement.

98
00:06:46,636 --> 00:06:48,695
- What is it?
- Iùs your first pellet.

99
00:06:48,872 --> 00:06:51,670
First? You mean there'll be more?

100
00:06:51,841 --> 00:06:53,866
Don't you recognize it, Eg?

101
00:06:54,044 --> 00:06:55,773
It was the mouse you ate.

102
00:06:55,945 --> 00:06:57,503
Its fur and bones, anyway.

103
00:06:58,281 --> 00:07:00,613
Every owl yarps up pellets.

104
00:07:00,784 --> 00:07:04,447
In fact, I think I might have
your brothers' first pellets.

105
00:07:04,621 --> 00:07:06,612
- No, no.
- Maybe you'd like to see them?

106
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:09,486
- No. Oh, Mrs. P, not again. Please.
- Oh, come on, dear.

107
00:07:09,659 --> 00:07:12,389
Such a big night for this tree.
First branching, first pellet.

108
00:07:13,763 --> 00:07:15,492
Excuse me.

109
00:07:15,665 --> 00:07:18,395
Kludd, do you want to go out
and try some more branching?

110
00:07:18,568 --> 00:07:21,230
What? So you can go out there
and show off again?

111
00:07:21,404 --> 00:07:22,530
I don't think so.

112
00:07:22,706 --> 00:07:24,333
Oh, maybe you're right.

113
00:07:24,507 --> 00:07:26,065
Maybe we should just...

114
00:07:26,242 --> 00:07:29,837
...I don't know, stay inside
and play Battle of the Ice claws again.

115
00:07:36,086 --> 00:07:40,182
Kludd? Could I just show you how?
Without you being so angry?

116
00:07:40,357 --> 00:07:42,484
All right. Show me how.

117
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:44,354
Well, before I leap...

118
00:07:44,527 --> 00:07:49,726
I picture myself standing on a great cliff
with the Guardians, ready for battle.

119
00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:53,062
We leap down,
floating silently like Lyze of Kiel.

120
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,895
- The air's just carrying us as we...
- Thaùs enough!

121
00:08:10,754 --> 00:08:12,847
Kludd, are you okay?

122
00:08:13,022 --> 00:08:14,250
Oh, no.

123
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:16,857
We're on the ground.

124
00:08:17,026 --> 00:08:18,516
We can't be here. Iùs... Iùs...

125
00:08:19,329 --> 00:08:22,059
This is the worst place for an owl.

126
00:08:22,732 --> 00:08:24,962
Yeah. No, no. Iùs weird down here.

127
00:08:25,135 --> 00:08:27,330
No. We gotta get back. We can't be here.

128
00:08:27,904 --> 00:08:31,670
You know, if we could just make it
to that branch.

129
00:08:31,841 --> 00:08:33,399
Then we could climb our way up.

130
00:08:34,344 --> 00:08:36,972
Yeah, here, leùs see.

131
00:08:42,452 --> 00:08:44,352
Shh! Quiet!

132
00:08:50,126 --> 00:08:51,150
What was that?

133
00:09:01,704 --> 00:09:02,728
Soren!

134
00:09:02,906 --> 00:09:03,930
Kludd!

135
00:09:12,782 --> 00:09:15,751
Kludd! Kludd!

136
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,432
Where are you taking us?

137
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,005
But our home's that way.

138
00:09:42,912 --> 00:09:44,038
You can't do this!

139
00:09:44,214 --> 00:09:47,809
Keep your mouth shut,
or I'll shut it for you.

140
00:09:47,984 --> 00:09:50,646
- Whaùd you think, Jutt?
- The "I'll shut it for you" part?

141
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,051
No, not that. My evil stare.
Been working on it for weeks.

142
00:09:54,257 --> 00:09:55,884
Oh. I missed it. Leùs see.

143
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,784
Lmpressive.

144
00:09:58,962 --> 00:09:59,986
- You like it?
- Yeah.

145
00:10:00,163 --> 00:10:04,259
You know, your evil stare reminds me
a little of my "Intimidator."

146
00:10:04,434 --> 00:10:06,231
Yeah?
I raise one eyebrow...

147
00:10:06,402 --> 00:10:07,460
...tuck in my chin and...

148
00:10:07,637 --> 00:10:09,867
- Who are you?
- Hey! No questions.

149
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:12,200
No "whos," no "whats," no "whys."

150
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,434
You'll see soon enough.

151
00:10:15,011 --> 00:10:17,878
What do you think?
Did that evil stare seem forced or natural?

152
00:10:18,047 --> 00:10:20,015
- Completely natural.
- Oh, thanks.

153
00:10:20,183 --> 00:10:21,582
Let me go!

154
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,544
Kludd!

155
00:10:32,095 --> 00:10:35,189
- Strong beak, that one.
- Yeah? Well, they'll put that to good use.

156
00:10:37,834 --> 00:10:40,496
You know, Jatt, if I use your evil stare...

157
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:43,036
...and combine it with
my raised-eyebrow look...

158
00:10:43,206 --> 00:10:44,230
...I get this.

159
00:10:44,407 --> 00:10:46,398
- What do you call that?
- "The Predator."

160
00:10:46,576 --> 00:10:49,773
"The Predator"?
Iùs a bit silly, don't you think?

161
00:11:13,703 --> 00:11:15,796
Hey, Jatt, look. Iùs Grimble.

162
00:11:16,005 --> 00:11:17,734
Perfect. Hit him with the new look.

163
00:11:17,907 --> 00:11:19,431
With or without raised eyebrow?

164
00:11:19,609 --> 00:11:22,203
With raised eyebrow.
With raised eyebrow.

165
00:11:22,645 --> 00:11:24,977
Greetings, Grimble.

166
00:11:25,148 --> 00:11:29,209
Jutt, Jatt, so nice to see you both.

167
00:11:29,385 --> 00:11:31,615
Did you only get half an owl tonight,
Grimble?

168
00:11:31,788 --> 00:11:33,585
No, Jatt. Iùs an elf owl.

169
00:11:33,756 --> 00:11:36,623
They're very small, but hard workers.

170
00:11:36,793 --> 00:11:39,159
Too old to carry a full-size one?

171
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:41,497
Yeah, hilarious.

172
00:11:41,664 --> 00:11:44,224
Is there something wrong
with your face, Jutt?

173
00:11:44,934 --> 00:11:46,925
Huh? No!

174
00:11:47,103 --> 00:11:49,071
You've upset him now.
Iùs a new look!

175
00:11:49,238 --> 00:11:50,967
But you gotta work on your comebacks.

176
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,164
I'm Soren.

177
00:11:53,142 --> 00:11:54,404
I'm Gylfie.

178
00:11:54,577 --> 00:11:56,238
He said you were an elf owl.

179
00:11:56,412 --> 00:11:58,937
From Kuneer. Thaùs in the desert.

180
00:11:59,115 --> 00:12:00,480
Are you a Tyto?

181
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:01,844
Yeah, from Tyto Forest.

182
00:12:02,051 --> 00:12:03,450
Who are these owls?

183
00:12:04,053 --> 00:12:06,146
Do you have any idea
where they're taking us?

184
00:12:06,322 --> 00:12:08,813
Hey! Stop talking.

185
00:12:53,836 --> 00:12:55,326
Quiet! Listen to the old man!

186
00:12:55,505 --> 00:12:56,529
Kludd!

187
00:12:56,706 --> 00:12:57,900
- Settle down.
- Silence!

188
00:12:58,074 --> 00:12:59,166
- Kludd!
- Silence!

189
00:12:59,475 --> 00:13:01,705
Your parents and families
have abandoned you.

190
00:13:02,378 --> 00:13:05,711
So from now,
you'll be classified as orphans.

191
00:13:05,882 --> 00:13:07,144
No, I'm not an orphan.

192
00:13:07,316 --> 00:13:09,181
Horribly tragic, I know.

193
00:13:09,352 --> 00:13:11,343
But by the mercy of Glaux...

194
00:13:11,521 --> 00:13:15,685
...you've been rescued
and brought here to St. Aegolius.

195
00:13:15,858 --> 00:13:19,726
And, in time, you'll come to be grateful
for the kindness shown to you.

196
00:13:19,896 --> 00:13:21,921
You'll repay that kindness with labor.

197
00:13:22,331 --> 00:13:23,923
Some of you will be pickers.

198
00:13:24,133 --> 00:13:25,657
No, I don't want to be a picker!

199
00:13:25,835 --> 00:13:28,269
- Some will be soldiers.
- Gylfie, stay with me.

200
00:13:28,438 --> 00:13:32,898
In your ways, all will serve
the High Tyto and the Pure Ones.

201
00:13:33,076 --> 00:13:34,737
- Let us go!
- Silence.

202
00:13:35,111 --> 00:13:36,840
We don't want to serve the Pure Ones.

203
00:13:37,013 --> 00:13:38,310
- Who are the Pure Ones?
- Silence!

204
00:13:57,467 --> 00:14:01,528
I am Nyra,
Ablah General of St. Aegolius...

205
00:14:01,704 --> 00:14:04,605
...and mate to the Lord High Tyto.

206
00:14:05,108 --> 00:14:07,906
I know right now
you miss your families...

207
00:14:08,077 --> 00:14:13,413
...but soon enough you will understand
the Pure Ones are your new family.

208
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:16,484
The Pure Ones are not our family.
Let us go!

209
00:14:16,953 --> 00:14:18,944
She's right. Let us go!

210
00:14:23,126 --> 00:14:24,150
Whaùs this?

211
00:14:26,963 --> 00:14:30,091
Tyto, don't waste your time.
Don't soil your feathers.

212
00:14:30,266 --> 00:14:31,494
You leave her be.

213
00:14:31,701 --> 00:14:35,603
Oh, spirited little Tyto. How touching.

214
00:14:35,772 --> 00:14:39,139
You and your patch of felt
will stay together, then.

215
00:14:39,308 --> 00:14:40,468
As pickers.

216
00:14:42,011 --> 00:14:43,842
Leùs go. Hurry up.

217
00:14:44,013 --> 00:14:49,007
Perhaps when you remember your nobility,
Tyto, we can make a soldier of you.

218
00:14:49,185 --> 00:14:50,652
- Come on.
- What about my brother?

219
00:14:50,853 --> 00:14:53,515
- Oh? Where's he?
- Kludd!

220
00:14:56,225 --> 00:14:59,524
Owlet, that one says you're his brother.

221
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:02,254
Would you like to join him?

222
00:15:07,303 --> 00:15:08,634
I didn't think so.

223
00:15:09,005 --> 00:15:10,029
Kludd?

224
00:15:10,206 --> 00:15:11,969
Here we go. Move along. Move it along.

225
00:15:12,141 --> 00:15:14,473
- Kludd!
- Now, there's a soldier.

226
00:15:28,357 --> 00:15:29,688
Thank you.

227
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,990
Soren, you know, you don't have to be here
with me. You should be with your brother.

228
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,061
No, Gylfie. I could never be
with those Tytos.

229
00:15:39,235 --> 00:15:41,100
I don't know why Kludd
would even think...

230
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,295
Hey! Whaùs wrong with him?

231
00:15:43,472 --> 00:15:45,064
He looks like he's been moon...

232
00:15:45,274 --> 00:15:47,799
All right, you owlets, move it in,
move it in. Come on!

233
00:15:47,977 --> 00:15:51,640
Do exactly as he says or you'll never
see the light of dawn.

234
00:15:51,814 --> 00:15:53,714
- Nice one, Jutt.
- Felt a little forced.

235
00:15:53,883 --> 00:15:56,351
- It was awesome.
- Thank you, Jatt.

236
00:16:05,728 --> 00:16:08,196
So tonight, we want you to...

237
00:16:08,364 --> 00:16:10,264
- What was it again, Jatt?
- To rest.

238
00:16:10,433 --> 00:16:11,491
To rest.

239
00:16:11,667 --> 00:16:13,430
So lean back, put your beaks up...

240
00:16:13,603 --> 00:16:17,505
...and turn your faces to the light
of the glorious full moon.

241
00:16:17,807 --> 00:16:20,071
<i>And sleep.</i>

242
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:24,546
Soren, we mustn't fall asleep.

243
00:16:25,014 --> 00:16:27,073
I think they're trying to moon blink us.

244
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,410
Moon blink us?

245
00:16:28,584 --> 00:16:32,247
Sometimes in the desert, owls would
get exhausted and collapse under it.

246
00:16:33,222 --> 00:16:36,248
When they woke up,
they just weren't the same.

247
00:16:37,593 --> 00:16:40,357
As if they'd forgotten who they were.

248
00:16:41,764 --> 00:16:45,825
Gylfie, we are going to get out of here.

249
00:16:48,738 --> 00:16:50,467
I know these stars.

250
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,437
I could get us away from here...

251
00:16:53,075 --> 00:16:55,566
...but the only way out is to fly
and we can't.

252
00:16:55,745 --> 00:16:56,803
Not yet, we can't.

253
00:16:57,446 --> 00:16:59,710
But we're gonna learn how.

254
00:16:59,882 --> 00:17:01,406
Whenever they're not watching...

255
00:17:01,584 --> 00:17:04,576
...every chance we get,
we're gonna stretch out our wings...

256
00:17:15,264 --> 00:17:17,789
Do you really think
that we can make it, Soren?

257
00:17:18,467 --> 00:17:20,935
Together, Gylfie, we'll get away.

258
00:17:22,071 --> 00:17:23,436
I'm cold.

259
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,002
Together.

260
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:45,921
All right, my lovely little owlets.
Thaùs enough beauty rest.

261
00:17:46,095 --> 00:17:48,859
Wakey, wakey. Rise and shine.
Iùs another glorious day...

262
00:17:49,031 --> 00:17:50,521
- Oh, no.
- Soren.

263
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,793
<i>Thaùs right. Here we go.
Move it along.</i>

264
00:17:52,969 --> 00:17:54,027
Soren.

265
00:17:54,403 --> 00:17:55,927
Where are we going now?

266
00:17:56,105 --> 00:17:58,801
Gylfie, we need to act moon blinked.

267
00:17:58,975 --> 00:18:00,943
Keep moving.
Lots of pellet picking ahead.

268
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:03,442
You may have noticed
that we don't like dawdling.

269
00:18:03,612 --> 00:18:06,775
Anything with W's in it,
we don't trust.

270
00:18:08,651 --> 00:18:11,017
Come on.
Shuffle those talons.

271
00:18:12,054 --> 00:18:14,488
The sooner you get there,
the sooner we start.

272
00:18:14,657 --> 00:18:17,626
The sooner you start,
the sooner we finish. Leùs go!

273
00:18:18,828 --> 00:18:20,295
Keep moving, no dawdling.

274
00:18:20,463 --> 00:18:22,954
And welcome to the Pelletorium.

275
00:18:23,132 --> 00:18:25,464
Iùs a great place
for the rest of your lives.

276
00:18:25,634 --> 00:18:28,626
You mustn't feel sorry for them
down there.

277
00:18:28,804 --> 00:18:34,140
As lower species, they are fortunate
to serve a higher cause.

278
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:37,973
As Tyto owls,
their natural superiors...

279
00:18:38,147 --> 00:18:40,911
...you too are part of that plan.

280
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:45,144
One that will soon bring order
to all the owl kingdoms...

281
00:18:45,321 --> 00:18:47,414
...when the Pure Ones will rule.

282
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:51,448
A new and noble era will dawn.

283
00:18:51,861 --> 00:18:53,761
Now, prove your greatness...

284
00:18:54,864 --> 00:18:56,661
...and rise.

285
00:18:58,501 --> 00:18:59,525
Higher!

286
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:06,872
Higher!

287
00:19:09,278 --> 00:19:11,405
Leùs get this party started!

288
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,445
Leùs get picking!

289
00:19:13,616 --> 00:19:15,846
Start picking up those pellets right now.

290
00:19:16,018 --> 00:19:18,179
Thaùs right. Think of the joy. Pellets.

291
00:19:18,354 --> 00:19:19,685
<i>We love them.</i>

292
00:19:19,855 --> 00:19:21,447
Ugh. Other owls' pellets.

293
00:19:21,624 --> 00:19:24,889
You know, maybe it would have been
better if we had been moon blinked.

294
00:19:25,061 --> 00:19:26,688
Oh, here we go.
Eureka.

295
00:19:26,862 --> 00:19:30,764
Great job, number 857... Whatever.

296
00:19:30,933 --> 00:19:33,026
All right, everyone, gather around.

297
00:19:33,202 --> 00:19:35,227
- Hey, you with the blank expression.
Thaùs all of them.

298
00:19:35,404 --> 00:19:38,396
Oh. Pay attention. He's talking.

299
00:19:38,574 --> 00:19:41,236
Now this is the kind of pellet
you're picking for.

300
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:44,140
Mouse fur, mouse bones,
thaùs all standard.

301
00:19:44,313 --> 00:19:49,080
But the secret rare ingredient in this one
is what Mr. Mouse ate:

302
00:19:49,251 --> 00:19:51,719
- A metal fleck.
- Metal fleck.

303
00:19:51,887 --> 00:19:53,377
Now, I'm very perceptive.

304
00:19:53,556 --> 00:19:54,614
- He is.
- I am.

305
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:57,657
- And I'm detecting you...
Nicely done.

306
00:19:57,827 --> 00:20:02,389
...want to volunteer to take this fleck
to where all the flecks belong.

307
00:20:02,565 --> 00:20:04,726
You all watching? Hm?

308
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,128
Come on.

309
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,444
Soren.

310
00:20:53,749 --> 00:20:56,479
Ha, ha. All right, more baskets to fill.

311
00:20:57,052 --> 00:20:58,451
Back to work.

312
00:21:00,122 --> 00:21:01,521
What happened?

313
00:21:01,724 --> 00:21:05,683
Listen, Gylfie, those birds are
doing something terribly wrong.

314
00:21:05,861 --> 00:21:08,295
We have to find Kludd
and we have to get out of here.

315
00:21:08,464 --> 00:21:11,627
And exactly what do you two think
you're doing?

316
00:21:12,334 --> 00:21:13,926
Eh?

317
00:21:19,575 --> 00:21:23,033
Once we have amassed enough flecks...

318
00:21:23,212 --> 00:21:25,043
...we will set a trap.

319
00:21:25,314 --> 00:21:30,650
Then it is up to you to lure our enemy
to their rightful place:

320
00:21:31,053 --> 00:21:33,647
Into our claws.

321
00:21:33,822 --> 00:21:39,788
And then the Western Kingdoms
and the Tree, those will be mine.

322
00:21:40,796 --> 00:21:43,356
You have my word.

323
00:22:02,851 --> 00:22:04,614
What do you plan on doing with us?

324
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,185
Quiet!

325
00:22:19,368 --> 00:22:21,268
What is this place?
Get inside.

326
00:22:21,537 --> 00:22:23,971
Stop asking questions.

327
00:22:28,577 --> 00:22:32,707
The Pure Ones won't be too happy
if you don't let us get to the Pelletorium.

328
00:22:32,881 --> 00:22:33,905
No.

329
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:38,213
And they won't be too happy when they
find out what I'm gonna do to you either.

330
00:22:39,955 --> 00:22:42,253
I'm gonna teach you to fly.

331
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:44,319
Fly?

332
00:22:44,493 --> 00:22:45,585
You can breathe now.

333
00:22:50,499 --> 00:22:52,558
Yeah, iùs been getting worse here.

334
00:22:53,168 --> 00:22:58,299
I told myself if any came who were smart,
and brave enough to resist...

335
00:22:58,474 --> 00:22:59,907
...l'd help them.

336
00:23:00,075 --> 00:23:02,407
I guess you two'll have to do.

337
00:23:02,578 --> 00:23:03,909
But aren't you a...?

338
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:07,014
A Pure One? No, I hate them.

339
00:23:07,383 --> 00:23:10,944
Almost as much as I hate
what they've turned me into.

340
00:23:11,887 --> 00:23:15,789
My feathers weren't always stained
with these colors.

341
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:21,622
<i>When the Pure Ones invaded our kingdom,
I fought back.</i>

342
00:23:22,031 --> 00:23:24,932
<i>Now, they thought they could use that...</i>

343
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,328
<i>...so they took my family.</i>

344
00:23:27,703 --> 00:23:31,662
<i>And they promised me if I followed orders,
no harm would come to them.</i>

345
00:23:33,776 --> 00:23:36,802
<i>And I've been doing their dirty work
ever since.</i>

346
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:48,321
Now, have you flown at all before?

347
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:50,014
Well, I have been branching.

348
00:23:50,192 --> 00:23:53,059
You don't have the luxury of
gliding down from a nest anymore.

349
00:23:53,228 --> 00:23:57,528
We need to work on your power skills,
starting with what you already know.

350
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,190
Show me what you can do.

351
00:24:00,536 --> 00:24:01,730
Come on.

352
00:24:10,979 --> 00:24:12,003
Hey, good, good.

353
00:24:13,182 --> 00:24:16,982
Now, try and feel every muscle,
every feather in each stroke.

354
00:24:19,321 --> 00:24:20,515
And push!

355
00:24:22,758 --> 00:24:23,782
Ow!

356
00:24:26,729 --> 00:24:29,960
All right, you two,
thaùs enough. Come on.

357
00:24:30,199 --> 00:24:31,496
Back to practice.

358
00:24:33,202 --> 00:24:35,397
Now, the best of you...

359
00:24:35,571 --> 00:24:37,937
...the fittest and the most brilliant...

360
00:24:38,107 --> 00:24:41,042
...I will present to the Lord High Tyto.

361
00:24:41,744 --> 00:24:44,679
So leùs see how much
you've improved...

362
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:48,074
...as fliers, as fighters.

363
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,212
Well?

364
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:49,973
Well done. You've shown exceptional
obedience and discipline.

365
00:25:50,145 --> 00:25:54,309
My husband will be most pleased
by your progress.

366
00:25:55,117 --> 00:25:59,816
Hm. Tell me, does your brother have
similar potential as a flier?

367
00:25:59,988 --> 00:26:01,046
Who, Soren?

368
00:26:01,356 --> 00:26:06,419
No. He fell out of the tree when
he was still a hatchling. He's lame.

369
00:26:06,628 --> 00:26:12,066
Oh, soldier, you mustn't
confuse praise for license.

370
00:26:12,301 --> 00:26:14,326
Never lie to me.

371
00:26:14,703 --> 00:26:19,367
For the Lord High Tyto, we need
as many strong fliers as we can find.

372
00:26:19,575 --> 00:26:23,306
Come, leùs tell your brother
what rewards there are...

373
00:26:23,479 --> 00:26:27,108
...for those who recognize
their true family.

374
00:26:27,983 --> 00:26:30,008
No, more flap, deeper flap.

375
00:26:30,285 --> 00:26:32,617
The still air has no shape to use.

376
00:26:32,788 --> 00:26:35,518
You gotta compensate
with your downstroke.

377
00:26:35,691 --> 00:26:40,060
Make your wing tips almost meet,
if you can, without stalling.

378
00:26:40,229 --> 00:26:44,325
I can't curl my feathers enough, Grimble.
My wings are too short.

379
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,526
Well, they said Lyze of Kiel's
wings were short.

380
00:26:47,703 --> 00:26:49,136
And that didn't stop him.

381
00:26:49,872 --> 00:26:53,569
And you're gonna need to fly
a long way to get to the Guardians.

382
00:26:53,742 --> 00:26:56,472
- The Guardians of Ga'Hoole?
- Yeah.

383
00:26:56,645 --> 00:26:58,374
But how will we know where to go?

384
00:26:58,547 --> 00:27:01,380
Well, you have to get to
the Sea of Hoolemere...

385
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:04,383
...yeah, where the Tree
is shrouded in ancient mists...

386
00:27:04,553 --> 00:27:09,149
"Which keep it hidden from all but the
strong of purpose and the true of heart."

387
00:27:09,324 --> 00:27:11,224
Yeah, exactly.

388
00:27:12,027 --> 00:27:13,392
I'd come with you...

389
00:27:13,562 --> 00:27:17,760
...but I still hold out the hope
of freeing my family.

390
00:27:17,933 --> 00:27:19,400
Really?

391
00:27:21,069 --> 00:27:22,593
- Kludd.
- Go!

392
00:27:22,771 --> 00:27:23,931
Kludd, come with us!

393
00:27:24,773 --> 00:27:25,831
Go, now!

394
00:27:26,008 --> 00:27:27,032
Get them!

395
00:27:36,418 --> 00:27:39,353
- Kludd!
- Your little owlets won't get away.

396
00:27:49,665 --> 00:27:51,155
Soren! What do we do?

397
00:27:59,708 --> 00:28:01,232
Soren, we have to go!

398
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:03,742
Wait. Kludd! Come on!
Now's our chance!

399
00:28:03,912 --> 00:28:07,712
Well, what are you waiting for, son?
This is your chance to go home!

400
00:28:11,219 --> 00:28:12,447
I am.

401
00:28:12,621 --> 00:28:14,111
I am home.

402
00:28:15,991 --> 00:28:17,583
- Eh?
- No.

403
00:28:21,964 --> 00:28:23,693
Would you wound your queen, Grimble?

404
00:28:23,999 --> 00:28:25,762
You're not my queen!

405
00:28:29,204 --> 00:28:30,694
We need to jump now, Soren!

406
00:28:33,942 --> 00:28:35,705
- Now! Aah!
Aah!

407
00:28:39,514 --> 00:28:41,573
Come on, Gylfie! Flap!

408
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:42,978
Flap your wings!

409
00:28:58,734 --> 00:29:01,225
No! Follow the owlets!

410
00:29:01,937 --> 00:29:03,996
Follow the owlets!

411
00:29:04,606 --> 00:29:05,766
Go, you fools!

412
00:29:05,941 --> 00:29:08,967
Go! Go tell the Guardians!

413
00:29:41,376 --> 00:29:43,503
Look! There! I see a way!

414
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,738
Where? Aah!

415
00:29:45,914 --> 00:29:48,883
Gylfie, come on, follow me!

416
00:30:14,076 --> 00:30:16,237
Faster, Gylfie. Come on! Faster!

417
00:30:16,411 --> 00:30:20,438
I can't, Soren, I just can't.
I have to rest.

418
00:30:20,749 --> 00:30:23,547
No, Gylfie. Come on, we have to!

419
00:30:27,189 --> 00:30:30,716
Hey, wait. I think they're gone.

420
00:30:30,892 --> 00:30:33,190
What? Are you sure?

421
00:30:37,899 --> 00:30:39,230
I think so.

422
00:30:46,475 --> 00:30:48,443
Hey, you know what?

423
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:49,872
What?

424
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:51,841
We're flying.

425
00:31:04,059 --> 00:31:06,459
Does it feel the way
you thought it would?

426
00:31:07,062 --> 00:31:08,154
No.

427
00:31:09,364 --> 00:31:11,457
It feels much better.

428
00:31:17,706 --> 00:31:19,936
What are we gonna do now, Soren?

429
00:31:20,108 --> 00:31:22,736
We're gonna find
the Guardians of Ga'Hoole.

430
00:31:26,915 --> 00:31:30,180
Grimble's death was unfortunate.

431
00:31:30,485 --> 00:31:31,816
But you...

432
00:31:31,987 --> 00:31:35,923
You had a chance to follow your brother,
yet you didn't.

433
00:31:36,091 --> 00:31:39,583
I'm starting to think that you might
actually deserve to stay.

434
00:31:39,761 --> 00:31:41,285
To be one of us.

435
00:31:41,463 --> 00:31:43,021
Oh, I want that.

436
00:31:43,198 --> 00:31:44,927
We offer power and purpose.

437
00:31:45,634 --> 00:31:47,124
What can you offer us?

438
00:31:48,003 --> 00:31:49,937
What can you offer me?

439
00:31:50,639 --> 00:31:52,004
I...

440
00:31:53,275 --> 00:31:55,835
- I have a sister.
- Go on.

441
00:31:56,311 --> 00:31:59,109
She's young, but she's got spirit...

442
00:31:59,481 --> 00:32:02,473
...and will grow into a strong Tyto.

443
00:32:02,651 --> 00:32:04,414
Perhaps you could bring her to me.

444
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:08,686
Here the young ones are our future.

445
00:32:11,793 --> 00:32:12,987
Are you hungry?

446
00:32:13,161 --> 00:32:14,287
Why?

447
00:32:14,462 --> 00:32:15,793
Watch this.

448
00:32:16,865 --> 00:32:20,631
Hey! Oh, nice hunting.
You should be really proud of yourself...

449
00:32:20,802 --> 00:32:22,702
...catching a moth thaùs already caught.

450
00:32:22,871 --> 00:32:24,429
Wait. You hadn't caught it.

451
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:28,970
Mm! I was very close.
One might even say I was this close:

452
00:32:29,711 --> 00:32:31,201
<u><b><i>Extracted from DVD by
ForsakeN</u></b></i>

453
00:32:31,379 --> 00:32:32,971
- Perfect.
Ahem.

454
00:32:34,382 --> 00:32:37,579
An ambush.
Well, I bet you didn't count on this.

455
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,329
I'm sorry.
We didn't mean to take your moth.

456
00:32:48,496 --> 00:32:50,521
- It wasn't his moth.
Yes, it was.

457
00:32:51,466 --> 00:32:54,162
We were just looking for a place
to hide and rest.

458
00:32:54,336 --> 00:32:55,928
- In which order?
What do you mean?

459
00:32:56,104 --> 00:32:58,231
Did you need to hide first
or rest first?

460
00:32:58,406 --> 00:32:59,839
What difference does it make?

461
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:03,742
Huge! If you need to hide first,
I'd say you were in big trouble.

462
00:33:03,912 --> 00:33:07,439
But if resting was on your mind,
I'd say your situation wasn't as dire.

463
00:33:07,616 --> 00:33:09,675
We're on our way to
the Sea of Hoolemere.

464
00:33:09,851 --> 00:33:11,876
We're gonna find
the Guardians of Ga'Hoole.

465
00:33:12,053 --> 00:33:13,247
Really?

466
00:33:14,222 --> 00:33:17,453
Two little owlets like you
will never reach the sea.

467
00:33:17,626 --> 00:33:20,720
There are some really scary beasts
out that way.

468
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:22,386
Scary beasts?

469
00:33:22,564 --> 00:33:26,193
If the hawks don't make a quick lunch
of you, then the buzzards will.

470
00:33:26,368 --> 00:33:28,893
And if the buzzards don't get you...

471
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:34,235
...the dingoes wait in the trees
and as you fly by they...

472
00:33:34,409 --> 00:33:37,708
Our request remains the same, owl.

473
00:33:38,146 --> 00:33:41,047
Do you have a place to rest?
My frienÔs hurt.

474
00:33:45,253 --> 00:33:46,652
Name's Digger.

475
00:33:49,591 --> 00:33:51,149
The hollow's this way.

476
00:33:53,762 --> 00:33:55,161
Going to the sea, huh?

477
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:56,422
Yeah.

478
00:33:57,065 --> 00:33:59,659
You know what they call owls
who fly towards the sea?

479
00:33:59,901 --> 00:34:01,766
- Uh, no.
- Lost.

480
00:34:03,338 --> 00:34:05,829
Iùs hilarious. I have another one for you.

481
00:34:06,007 --> 00:34:07,406
What do you call an owl...?

482
00:34:07,842 --> 00:34:10,003
Twilight! We've got company!

483
00:34:10,178 --> 00:34:12,339
Put me down this instant! I mean it!

484
00:34:12,547 --> 00:34:14,344
This is highly disrespectful!

485
00:34:15,483 --> 00:34:17,007
Dinner is served.

486
00:34:17,185 --> 00:34:19,779
And she will not stop talking.

487
00:34:19,955 --> 00:34:21,183
Mrs. P! Iùs me, Soren!

488
00:34:21,356 --> 00:34:22,448
Soren!

489
00:34:22,958 --> 00:34:24,789
Oh, it can't be.

490
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,488
Every day, I've been looking for
you and Kludd, and then this.

491
00:34:29,664 --> 00:34:32,428
To be snatched up by this monstrosity.

492
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,262
Monstro...? The audacity!

493
00:34:35,437 --> 00:34:38,838
Digger, who are these tiny owls
and why are they talking to dinner?

494
00:34:39,007 --> 00:34:40,702
My name is not "dinner."

495
00:34:42,077 --> 00:34:44,477
Well, dinner's rather moody, isn't it?

496
00:34:44,646 --> 00:34:47,308
Wait. She is not dinner.
She's my nursemaid.

497
00:34:47,482 --> 00:34:51,441
I just hate being driven to hiss.
So unladylike.

498
00:34:51,619 --> 00:34:52,677
Indeed.

499
00:34:52,854 --> 00:34:56,449
Mrs. P, these are my new friends.
This is Gylfie and Digger.

500
00:34:56,624 --> 00:34:58,216
And Twilight, is it?

501
00:34:58,393 --> 00:35:00,327
Charmed to meet you, dinner.

502
00:35:00,495 --> 00:35:02,156
Oh, I mean, Mrs. P.

503
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:04,560
These two are going
to the Sea of Hoolemere...

504
00:35:04,733 --> 00:35:06,200
...to find the Guardians.

505
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,699
- Really?
What?

506
00:35:07,869 --> 00:35:12,568
No, Soren, we need to get you home.
Your parents are so worried.

507
00:35:12,741 --> 00:35:15,972
No, you don't understand, Mrs. P.
Kludd and I were kidnapped.

508
00:35:16,144 --> 00:35:18,738
- Mercy!
- He's still held captive.

509
00:35:18,913 --> 00:35:22,144
I have to find the Guardians.
They're the only ones that can save him.

510
00:35:22,317 --> 00:35:23,716
An adventure afoot!

511
00:35:23,885 --> 00:35:25,682
Danger. Intrigue.

512
00:35:25,854 --> 00:35:27,845
The stuff of songs.

513
00:35:28,023 --> 00:35:29,752
Oh, no. Not the lute.

514
00:35:29,924 --> 00:35:32,188
But such things have no effect on me...

515
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:35,454
...for I am a poet as much as a warrior.

516
00:35:36,865 --> 00:35:38,355
If you will...

517
00:35:38,533 --> 00:35:41,559
<i>Though his nursemaid tels him no</i>

518
00:35:41,736 --> 00:35:43,533
<i>The boy will not be tamed</i>

519
00:35:43,705 --> 00:35:46,697
<i>He flies off into danger</i>

520
00:35:46,875 --> 00:35:50,936
<i>To be battered, bruised and maimed</i>

521
00:35:51,546 --> 00:35:53,878
Just because iùs sung
doesn't make it a song.

522
00:35:54,049 --> 00:35:56,381
That poem just came to me,
if you can believe it.

523
00:35:56,551 --> 00:35:59,213
- I think they can believe it.
- Iùs a gift.

524
00:36:00,422 --> 00:36:05,189
Right, well, sounds like we've got
a long journey, so...

525
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,384
Mrs. P?

526
00:36:07,462 --> 00:36:09,555
Look, you know iùs what
Da would want.

527
00:36:09,731 --> 00:36:11,562
Thaùs just why I'm coming with you.

528
00:36:11,733 --> 00:36:14,395
What? No! Please do not leave us here.

529
00:36:14,569 --> 00:36:17,231
Yes, you're the first new souls
we've seen in eight moons.

530
00:36:17,405 --> 00:36:20,533
If I have to hear any more
of his ridiculous owl jokes...

531
00:36:20,708 --> 00:36:22,198
- They're a hoot!
- They are not.

532
00:36:22,377 --> 00:36:25,813
Well, if I have to hear him play
one more quote-unquote "song"...

533
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,675
...l'm gonna tear my gizzard out!

534
00:36:27,849 --> 00:36:29,942
How dare you?!
Leùs get out.

535
00:36:30,118 --> 00:36:31,608
Please. Please don't go!

536
00:36:32,687 --> 00:36:36,350
Do you even know the way
to the Sea of Hoolemere?

537
00:36:37,425 --> 00:36:40,292
- Twilight knows the way.
- Of course I know the way.

538
00:36:40,462 --> 00:36:43,329
We are off to the Sea of Hooladance.

539
00:36:43,498 --> 00:36:46,023
- Iùs "Hoolemere."
- Hoolemere.

540
00:36:49,204 --> 00:36:52,935
Hey, you know, Mrs. P,
you might be the first snake ever to fly.

541
00:36:53,108 --> 00:36:55,269
You know, I think I am.

542
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:59,138
And I quite like it too.

543
00:36:59,314 --> 00:37:01,782
Oh, my!

544
00:37:46,494 --> 00:37:47,791
Shove it.

545
00:37:51,065 --> 00:37:52,999
- My lord.
Hm?

546
00:37:53,168 --> 00:37:56,262
Our work at St. Aegolius
is very nearly done.

547
00:37:56,671 --> 00:37:59,162
The last of the flecks are on their way.

548
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:03,208
And I've brought you an offering
with beating hearts.

549
00:38:03,378 --> 00:38:06,973
Your new soldiers. Tested and pure.

550
00:38:07,682 --> 00:38:11,379
One in particular shows
exceptional promise.

551
00:38:11,819 --> 00:38:13,480
I'll be the judge of that.

552
00:38:13,788 --> 00:38:15,779
You. Soldier.

553
00:38:16,491 --> 00:38:18,083
Step forward.

554
00:38:19,827 --> 00:38:22,557
Yes, you're right to be afraid
in my presence.

555
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:23,992
What is your name?

556
00:38:24,899 --> 00:38:26,924
- Kludd.
Speak up.

557
00:38:27,101 --> 00:38:30,036
Ahem. Kludd! My name is Kludd.

558
00:38:30,205 --> 00:38:32,230
There. Thaùs better.

559
00:38:32,407 --> 00:38:36,070
Remember, weakness is for
the lower species...

560
00:38:36,244 --> 00:38:39,008
...never for us.

561
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,045
Do you know why, Kludd?

562
00:38:43,218 --> 00:38:46,676
Because we are Tytos.

563
00:38:53,228 --> 00:38:54,422
Oh, I got another one.

564
00:38:54,596 --> 00:38:55,995
- Knock, knock.
Please don't respond.

565
00:38:56,164 --> 00:38:57,859
Who's there?
Don't encourage him.

566
00:38:58,032 --> 00:38:59,363
Owls.
Owls who?

567
00:38:59,534 --> 00:39:02,264
Here it comes.
Ha, thaùs right. Owls whoo!

568
00:39:02,437 --> 00:39:03,461
I told you.

569
00:39:03,638 --> 00:39:05,868
Because owls whoo. Funny.
Absolutely pathetic.

570
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,974
Iùs a very complex one, but iùs...

571
00:39:14,415 --> 00:39:18,647
<i>As the night falls, so do we</i>

572
00:39:19,287 --> 00:39:21,414
<i>we fall asleep</i>

573
00:39:22,123 --> 00:39:24,455
<i>we fall asleep</i>

574
00:39:33,234 --> 00:39:35,259
<i>We continue to fall asleep</i>

575
00:39:35,603 --> 00:39:39,095
<i>we fall asleep</i>

576
00:39:39,941 --> 00:39:42,933
<i>For dreams, they come on highly</i>

577
00:39:43,111 --> 00:39:44,942
Shh! Shh!

578
00:39:47,615 --> 00:39:50,379
<i>We are now asleep</i>

579
00:39:50,985 --> 00:39:56,981
<i>we are now asleep</i>

580
00:40:07,769 --> 00:40:10,260
You know,
I think that crow is following us.

581
00:40:10,438 --> 00:40:12,770
Yes. I've had my eye on him for a while.

582
00:40:14,742 --> 00:40:17,006
Know what an owl says
when he's pecked by a crow?

583
00:40:17,178 --> 00:40:18,839
Really, Digger, must you?

584
00:40:19,013 --> 00:40:20,981
Ow!
- Thaùs right, "Ow"!

585
00:40:22,283 --> 00:40:24,547
Hey! Get out of here!

586
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,949
Oh, that is it.

587
00:40:28,122 --> 00:40:29,555
Twilight! Your lute!

588
00:40:29,757 --> 00:40:31,622
Oh, let them have it. Good riddance.

589
00:40:31,793 --> 00:40:34,193
- Oh, wait. Oh, no!
- Oh, yes!

590
00:40:34,662 --> 00:40:35,822
Mrs. P!

591
00:40:35,997 --> 00:40:37,055
Come on!

592
00:40:42,203 --> 00:40:44,831
Mrs. P! I'm coming!

593
00:40:48,509 --> 00:40:50,033
Soren, look!

594
00:40:54,215 --> 00:40:55,477
Help!

595
00:40:55,917 --> 00:40:56,975
They're too fast.

596
00:40:57,151 --> 00:40:59,346
I'll get you closer.
We're going to lock talons!

597
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,681
What?
- Trust me! I know what I'm doing!

598
00:41:01,856 --> 00:41:03,551
Yeah, but have you done this before?

599
00:41:03,725 --> 00:41:06,159
No, but I've always wanted to try it!

600
00:41:06,327 --> 00:41:07,419
Hold on!

601
00:41:13,301 --> 00:41:14,700
Mrs. P!

602
00:41:15,436 --> 00:41:17,336
Get out of here! Begone!

603
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:24,437
Oh, Mrs. P. Are you okay?

604
00:41:24,612 --> 00:41:26,512
Quite a ride.

605
00:41:27,181 --> 00:41:29,081
Leùs do that again.

606
00:41:30,585 --> 00:41:33,452
Owl, you surely can fly.

607
00:41:33,621 --> 00:41:35,418
Thank you, Twilight.

608
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:39,185
Well, here we are.

609
00:41:48,202 --> 00:41:50,227
The Sea of Hoolemere.

610
00:41:51,139 --> 00:41:53,699
Iùs just so big.

611
00:41:54,075 --> 00:41:56,737
Yes, iùs a right big puddle there.

612
00:41:56,978 --> 00:41:58,445
I don't know.

613
00:41:58,613 --> 00:42:00,774
You really think the Guardians
are out there?

614
00:42:01,249 --> 00:42:02,409
They have to be.

615
00:42:02,583 --> 00:42:03,641
The band!

616
00:42:03,851 --> 00:42:04,909
- Finally.
- Who's there?

617
00:42:05,086 --> 00:42:06,951
Your arrival 'twas foretold.

618
00:42:07,121 --> 00:42:10,215
'Twas foretold trespassers
would land on my shore.

619
00:42:10,391 --> 00:42:11,824
Look, we mean you no harm.

620
00:42:11,993 --> 00:42:13,756
Yes. 'Twas foretold as well.

621
00:42:13,928 --> 00:42:16,419
- We've flown a long way.
- Also foretold.

622
00:42:16,597 --> 00:42:18,827
- And we're very tired.
- Foretold!

623
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,126
I know all.

624
00:42:20,301 --> 00:42:22,565
Now, state your desire, owl.

625
00:42:22,737 --> 00:42:23,829
- Well...
- Wait.

626
00:42:24,005 --> 00:42:26,940
If you really know all,
then how come you don't know that?

627
00:42:27,108 --> 00:42:30,509
Ah! 'Twas foretold there would be
one who doubts.

628
00:42:31,612 --> 00:42:33,477
Is anyone else having trouble with this?

629
00:42:33,648 --> 00:42:34,979
Yes, I kind of am.

630
00:42:35,149 --> 00:42:38,744
Da said, "guided by the spines
of the echidna."

631
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,979
Wait! Wait, you're an echidna!

632
00:42:41,155 --> 00:42:42,645
I am the echidna.

633
00:42:42,824 --> 00:42:45,918
And it was foretold you would need
some help getting here.

634
00:42:46,093 --> 00:42:49,119
Well, then, I should tell you,
we seek the Guardians.

635
00:42:49,297 --> 00:42:50,764
He should already know that.

636
00:42:50,932 --> 00:42:53,366
I do, doubter. Go on.

637
00:42:53,534 --> 00:42:55,161
Da said your spines can guide us.

638
00:42:55,336 --> 00:42:56,360
And they will.

639
00:42:56,537 --> 00:43:01,600
Now, to reach the Tree, keep between
the Whale's Fin and the Eye of Glaux.

640
00:43:01,776 --> 00:43:04,176
Never go outside those stars.

641
00:43:06,447 --> 00:43:08,142
Now, go! All of you.

642
00:43:13,554 --> 00:43:16,955
'Twas foretold that the band
would hesitate.

643
00:43:17,525 --> 00:43:20,551
But that in time would become a family.

644
00:43:20,728 --> 00:43:24,960
And a family needs all of its members
to play their parts.

645
00:43:25,132 --> 00:43:26,360
The warrior.

646
00:43:26,534 --> 00:43:28,331
Poet warrior, please. Thank you.

647
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:31,197
Fine, strong and noble.

648
00:43:31,572 --> 00:43:34,234
The tracker, sturdy and faithful.

649
00:43:34,442 --> 00:43:36,842
The navigator, who doubts.

650
00:43:37,044 --> 00:43:40,241
The leader, whose gizzard is strong.

651
00:43:40,448 --> 00:43:44,111
And finally, of course, the heart.

652
00:43:45,086 --> 00:43:47,213
Wait. Are you a snake?

653
00:43:47,388 --> 00:43:48,685
Yes, I am.

654
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:54,658
You've all come this far,
each protecting the other.

655
00:43:54,829 --> 00:43:58,458
So go. Look to the sky, and fly.

656
00:43:59,901 --> 00:44:02,096
All right. Leùs go.

657
00:44:04,338 --> 00:44:07,205
Remember, when your wings are weak...

658
00:44:07,375 --> 00:44:09,343
...your spirits done...

659
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:11,910
...and you've flown as far as you can...

660
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:14,912
...you're halfway there!

661
00:44:15,283 --> 00:44:16,375
What did he say?

662
00:44:16,551 --> 00:44:19,384
We're halfway there! Oh, yeah.

663
00:44:19,554 --> 00:44:22,387
Woo-hoo! This is gonna be a breeze.

664
00:44:26,093 --> 00:44:27,287
We're lost!

665
00:44:28,095 --> 00:44:30,063
I can't find my bearings.

666
00:44:31,132 --> 00:44:32,929
We have to find the island!

667
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:34,397
We're in the mist.

668
00:44:34,569 --> 00:44:38,130
The Tree must be on the other side.
I can feel it in my gizzard!

669
00:44:38,306 --> 00:44:39,568
Your gizzard?

670
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:45,076
Does anyone else have any more solid
information about how much further it is?

671
00:44:45,246 --> 00:44:47,407
Digger, why are you flying like that?

672
00:44:47,582 --> 00:44:50,073
Like what? You know how I fly.

673
00:44:50,251 --> 00:44:51,411
Iùs not that!

674
00:44:51,586 --> 00:44:53,315
Digger! Your wings!

675
00:44:54,622 --> 00:44:56,249
I think...

676
00:44:57,058 --> 00:44:58,150
Goodbye.

677
00:44:58,926 --> 00:45:00,621
- Digger.
- Digger!

678
00:45:01,762 --> 00:45:04,128
Aah! Digger!

679
00:45:17,478 --> 00:45:20,140
Digger? Digger.

680
00:45:20,848 --> 00:45:22,839
Oh, no. No.

681
00:45:43,804 --> 00:45:45,135
Can you fly with me?

682
00:45:46,173 --> 00:45:47,538
There are...

683
00:45:47,708 --> 00:45:49,266
There are five of us.

684
00:45:49,443 --> 00:45:51,206
Yes. We know.

685
00:47:23,704 --> 00:47:25,638
Can you see whaùs happening?

686
00:47:26,907 --> 00:47:28,875
Out of my way, I can't see.

687
00:47:29,043 --> 00:47:31,739
I can't hear a thing.
Shh!

688
00:47:31,912 --> 00:47:32,936
I wanna see!

689
00:47:33,114 --> 00:47:36,413
I'm concerned about this
fleck material of which they speak.

690
00:47:36,584 --> 00:47:39,018
It could be a weapon.
Could be a new shield or armor.

691
00:47:39,186 --> 00:47:40,915
Having examined them, Your Majesty...

692
00:47:41,088 --> 00:47:43,420
...they do show signs
of the trials they described.

693
00:47:43,591 --> 00:47:48,619
It beggars belief to think that these brave
owlets would fly here by themselves...

694
00:47:48,796 --> 00:47:50,058
...to spin a fairy tale.

695
00:47:50,231 --> 00:47:52,893
Heh-heh-heh.
- Does my Lord Allomere feel otherwise?

696
00:47:53,067 --> 00:47:54,728
Oh, good Glaux.

697
00:47:55,102 --> 00:47:58,265
Boron, Your Majesty,
if I understand this correctly...

698
00:47:58,439 --> 00:48:00,669
...Metal Beak is not a myth...

699
00:48:00,841 --> 00:48:03,776
...he's building a slave army
of moon-blinked owlets...

700
00:48:03,944 --> 00:48:08,643
...and is planning to conquer the world
with magical pellet debris.

701
00:48:09,917 --> 00:48:11,544
Without intending any disrespect...

702
00:48:11,719 --> 00:48:15,485
...and particularly to my little friends,
who have been through so much...

703
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:20,586
...such a story simply stretches
plausibility too far.

704
00:48:22,963 --> 00:48:26,330
Does that notion strike Ezylryb
as amusing?

705
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:27,524
What cheek!

706
00:48:27,735 --> 00:48:32,672
Whaùs amusing to me is that you would
cover yourself by besmirching these fliers.

707
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:35,968
Perhaps my good fellow Ezylryb
wishes us to race back to war.

708
00:48:36,143 --> 00:48:37,337
No, no.

709
00:48:37,511 --> 00:48:41,208
Perhaps he'd write a poem about it
from his hollow, while the rest of us...

710
00:48:41,382 --> 00:48:44,977
Well, while the rest of us
had our talons deformed too.

711
00:48:45,152 --> 00:48:47,416
But I say caution...

712
00:48:47,588 --> 00:48:49,146
...when the losses could be so many.

713
00:48:50,658 --> 00:48:53,422
I would never counsel
rushing blindly into war...

714
00:48:53,594 --> 00:48:56,119
...but for a cause such as the one
the boy described...

715
00:48:56,297 --> 00:48:58,765
...for a violation of peace
so blatant, so powerful...

716
00:48:58,933 --> 00:49:00,025
...of course I'd fight!

717
00:49:00,201 --> 00:49:01,691
What other course to take?

718
00:49:02,136 --> 00:49:06,505
And if you think I'm a coward, or I'd simply
urge others on, I'll fight you right now.

719
00:49:06,674 --> 00:49:08,539
Order.
- Boron, you can judge the winner.

720
00:49:08,709 --> 00:49:11,177
Mildly, owls.
We're trying to seek the truth.

721
00:49:11,345 --> 00:49:12,744
The truth?

722
00:49:12,913 --> 00:49:14,540
I told you the truth.

723
00:49:14,715 --> 00:49:16,910
The Pure Ones exist.

724
00:49:17,084 --> 00:49:20,645
They've kidnapped me and dozens
of owlets from our hollows.

725
00:49:20,821 --> 00:49:24,188
They want to enslave us all
and rule our world without pity.

726
00:49:26,794 --> 00:49:30,059
Yes, the only proof I have are my words.

727
00:49:30,231 --> 00:49:33,359
But words were the only proof I ever had
that you were real.

728
00:49:34,335 --> 00:49:36,235
And still, I believed.

729
00:49:37,438 --> 00:49:39,906
And you would argue with that?

730
00:49:41,609 --> 00:49:42,906
I will not argue with it.

731
00:49:43,077 --> 00:49:45,204
Your Majesty,
my search and rescue chaw...

732
00:49:45,379 --> 00:49:48,746
...is scheduled to leave on a routine
survey during the next full moon.

733
00:49:48,916 --> 00:49:50,383
No.
- Perhaps we could...

734
00:49:50,551 --> 00:49:51,916
You shall leave immediately.

735
00:49:52,086 --> 00:49:55,749
Take your best owls with you, Allomere.
And be thorough.

736
00:50:06,267 --> 00:50:07,393
Wow.

737
00:50:07,568 --> 00:50:09,866
Soren, we did it.

738
00:50:10,037 --> 00:50:12,267
Yeah. Yeah, I guess we did.

739
00:50:13,607 --> 00:50:16,201
I just hope Allomere finds the owlets.

740
00:50:17,611 --> 00:50:20,580
Oh, to be a young owl
with a taste for adventure...

741
00:50:20,748 --> 00:50:23,080
...arriving to the Tree for the first time.

742
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:26,078
Well done to hold your own in there.

743
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:28,945
Some more nice strong gizzards.

744
00:50:29,356 --> 00:50:31,119
The Tree always needs them.

745
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:35,928
He is one strange owl.

746
00:50:36,096 --> 00:50:38,963
I think he might be missing a few talons.

747
00:50:39,133 --> 00:50:40,498
And a good bath.

748
00:50:40,668 --> 00:50:42,135
Gross old owl.

749
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:44,271
You'll want to stay out of his chaw.

750
00:50:44,438 --> 00:50:47,601
- Chaw?
- I'll tell you on the way to dinner.

751
00:50:48,375 --> 00:50:50,172
You're already late.

752
00:51:00,654 --> 00:51:01,678
Look out!

753
00:51:01,855 --> 00:51:05,951
Now, Matron's instructed me to give you lot
a rundown on the way we do things here.

754
00:51:06,126 --> 00:51:07,491
During your basic training...

755
00:51:07,661 --> 00:51:09,458
Wait, wait, wait. Basic training?

756
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:13,031
You don't just become a Guardian
overnight. It takes years. Years.

757
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,527
- Hello.
Only our absolute best...

758
00:51:15,703 --> 00:51:18,035
...are chosen to be...
- Wait. Who are you?

759
00:51:18,205 --> 00:51:20,139
Are you going to keep interrupting me?

760
00:51:21,342 --> 00:51:23,867
Now, if, however unlikely,
you do have talent...

761
00:51:24,411 --> 00:51:27,676
...you'll be tapped, or selected,
for a specialized chaw, or squadron.

762
00:51:28,515 --> 00:51:31,882
There's navigation, healing,
search and rescue...

763
00:51:32,052 --> 00:51:35,351
...blacksmithing, weather interpretation,
colliering.

764
00:51:35,522 --> 00:51:39,117
I expect to be placed in
the navigation chaw myself.

765
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,323
Name's Otulissa, by the way.

766
00:51:41,495 --> 00:51:44,123
I'm... I'm Soren. Heh.

767
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,361
I believe your friends are in there.

768
00:51:52,072 --> 00:51:54,370
Digger! Hi!

769
00:52:02,449 --> 00:52:03,711
How's the food, Digger?

770
00:52:06,353 --> 00:52:10,483
He said "good," but he thinks
iùll go better with a little music.

771
00:52:10,657 --> 00:52:14,024
- What?
- And this looks like a decent crowd.

772
00:52:15,696 --> 00:52:17,357
He's actually pretty good, you know.

773
00:52:17,531 --> 00:52:20,329
Oh, I guess. If you like that sort of thing.

774
00:52:23,537 --> 00:52:25,004
Here at the Great Tree...

775
00:52:25,172 --> 00:52:29,506
...every owl trains in different skills
we call "chaws."

776
00:52:29,676 --> 00:52:31,268
You'll study tracking...

777
00:52:31,512 --> 00:52:33,104
...navigating, combat.

778
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,077
But maybe you're a blacksmith.

779
00:52:45,526 --> 00:52:47,118
Here I come, here I come.

780
00:52:48,429 --> 00:52:49,828
Digger!

781
00:52:50,731 --> 00:52:52,722
Ow! Hey! Hold it!

782
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:55,368
Hang on, hang on. Ow!

783
00:53:39,746 --> 00:53:43,113
Fire, boy. Iùs the lifeblood of the Tree.

784
00:53:43,283 --> 00:53:46,252
There's nothing more dangerous. Hm?

785
00:53:47,654 --> 00:53:48,678
Owls.

786
00:53:52,059 --> 00:53:53,754
You must be joking.

787
00:53:57,264 --> 00:53:58,697
Preposterous!

788
00:53:58,866 --> 00:54:00,993
Come back here! I wasn't ready.

789
00:54:03,937 --> 00:54:05,427
Feel the air!

790
00:54:06,173 --> 00:54:07,504
Follow me.

791
00:54:28,028 --> 00:54:31,520
My soldiers, my sons...

792
00:54:31,698 --> 00:54:35,293
...many of you have heard of me
in late-night whisperings...

793
00:54:35,469 --> 00:54:39,371
...but I assure you, I am not a myth.

794
00:54:40,107 --> 00:54:41,574
I am real.

795
00:54:41,742 --> 00:54:46,008
And I stand before you
with one simple truth:

796
00:54:46,513 --> 00:54:49,812
The strong shall rule the weak.

797
00:54:52,119 --> 00:54:57,421
Long ago, I was viciously attacked
by the coward Lyze of Kiel...

798
00:54:57,624 --> 00:55:00,320
...for defending that truth.

799
00:55:00,928 --> 00:55:05,024
Now I wear this mask
to conceal my scars.

800
00:55:05,199 --> 00:55:08,362
But the metal is strong.

801
00:55:09,269 --> 00:55:14,536
It is a symbol of the Pure Ones'
strength and resolve.

802
00:55:14,708 --> 00:55:19,372
It is time to set a fire that will consume
the owl kingdoms...

803
00:55:19,546 --> 00:55:23,004
...and take back what is rightfully ours!

804
00:55:23,183 --> 00:55:25,515
Because we are Tytos!

805
00:55:26,153 --> 00:55:28,747
We are Pure Ones!

806
00:55:29,289 --> 00:55:32,622
And I am Metal Beak!

807
00:55:32,859 --> 00:55:34,918
<i>Metal Beak. Metal Beak.</i>

808
00:55:35,095 --> 00:55:36,858
<i>Metal Beak. Metal Beak.</i>

809
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:38,759
<i>- Kludd?
- Metal Beak.</i>

810
00:55:38,932 --> 00:55:40,092
<i>- Kludd.
- Metal Beak.</i>

811
00:55:40,267 --> 00:55:42,394
I miss Ma and Da.

812
00:55:42,703 --> 00:55:43,931
I'm scared.

813
00:55:44,504 --> 00:55:46,472
Don't be. You're with me now.

814
00:55:46,673 --> 00:55:49,107
Eglantine, this is our home.

815
00:55:49,276 --> 00:55:51,608
They really appreciate us here.

816
00:55:51,778 --> 00:55:54,474
Kludd, please,
could we just go find Soren?

817
00:55:54,648 --> 00:55:57,378
Hey, hey! Forget about Soren.

818
00:55:57,551 --> 00:56:00,111
Soren's weak. We're Tytos.

819
00:56:01,922 --> 00:56:03,321
Pure Ones.

820
00:56:03,957 --> 00:56:08,223
Kludd, I promise I won't tell anyone
what you're doing.

821
00:56:08,395 --> 00:56:10,158
I just wanna go home.

822
00:56:10,330 --> 00:56:11,763
All right, Eg.

823
00:56:11,932 --> 00:56:14,332
So we could go? When?

824
00:56:14,501 --> 00:56:15,729
Tomorrow.

825
00:56:16,703 --> 00:56:18,796
But first, tonight...

826
00:56:18,972 --> 00:56:20,462
...just sleep.

827
00:56:37,724 --> 00:56:40,284
Doing some wee-hours reading, eh?

828
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:42,621
Yeah. Iùs the Battle of the Ice claws.

829
00:56:42,796 --> 00:56:45,094
You know, this is my da's favorite story.

830
00:56:45,365 --> 00:56:47,356
He used to tell it to us all the time.

831
00:56:47,601 --> 00:56:50,126
Well, your da had good taste in authors.

832
00:56:50,804 --> 00:56:51,998
You enjoying it?

833
00:56:52,172 --> 00:56:55,300
Honestly, iùs not at all like my da told it.

834
00:56:55,475 --> 00:56:57,306
No? How did he tell it?

835
00:56:57,477 --> 00:57:00,002
Well, Da always made it seem so heroic.

836
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:02,273
You know? Like a great victory.

837
00:57:02,449 --> 00:57:05,384
Well, in these chronicles, I mean,
the battle just sounds like...

838
00:57:05,552 --> 00:57:06,780
Like hell?

839
00:57:09,189 --> 00:57:11,714
Come on, boy. Iùs almost first light.

840
00:57:11,892 --> 00:57:13,985
You've got a big day tomorrow.

841
00:57:14,161 --> 00:57:17,460
I'm going to teach you how to really fly.

842
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:24,063
Feel the gutters! The currents in the rain.

843
00:57:26,707 --> 00:57:27,833
A scupper!

844
00:57:28,008 --> 00:57:29,168
A swillage!

845
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:30,503
Baggywrinkles!

846
00:57:30,877 --> 00:57:32,242
"Baggywrinkles"?

847
00:57:32,412 --> 00:57:34,903
He could have at least given us
a vocabulary list.

848
00:57:35,082 --> 00:57:38,483
Now, this, this is the way to learn!

849
00:57:38,652 --> 00:57:41,348
Oh, yes! This is exactly how
I want to learn.

850
00:57:41,521 --> 00:57:42,647
In a monsoon!

851
00:57:47,094 --> 00:57:50,086
The air currents warm
in different ways, you see...

852
00:57:50,297 --> 00:57:52,390
...from the sky to the ocean.

853
00:57:52,566 --> 00:57:54,193
You can't fight them.

854
00:57:54,368 --> 00:57:57,531
You have to feel them
with your gizzards.

855
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:02,738
Aha! You see that one?

856
00:58:02,909 --> 00:58:04,570
Soren, see it! Iùs there.

857
00:58:04,745 --> 00:58:06,372
Go for it.

858
00:58:06,913 --> 00:58:09,507
Thaùs it! Use your gizzard, boy.

859
00:58:09,683 --> 00:58:11,048
Trust it!

860
00:58:11,218 --> 00:58:13,812
Fly inside.

861
00:58:25,432 --> 00:58:27,024
He sees it.

862
00:58:28,101 --> 00:58:29,534
He sees it.

863
00:58:47,621 --> 00:58:50,089
Hold it. Hold it.

864
00:58:55,896 --> 00:58:59,195
Soren. Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, careful, look out!

865
00:58:59,366 --> 00:59:01,561
Soren!
Soren!

866
00:59:10,577 --> 00:59:12,772
Owl, come to my hollow.

867
00:59:17,150 --> 00:59:18,947
So lean back, put your beaks up...

868
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:22,714
...and turn your faces to the light
of the glorious full moon...

869
00:59:22,923 --> 00:59:24,151
...and sleep.

870
00:59:24,324 --> 00:59:27,851
Lord Allomere, the boy was right.
Those owlets, we have to rescue them.

871
00:59:28,028 --> 00:59:30,223
Caution. We mustn't rush in blindly.

872
00:59:30,430 --> 00:59:32,557
We don't know what we're up against.

873
00:59:35,368 --> 00:59:36,995
Now, see those bats?

874
00:59:37,471 --> 00:59:41,669
Follow them. I'll wager we'll discover
the full extent of their plan.

875
00:59:52,686 --> 00:59:53,880
Hold!

876
01:00:03,697 --> 01:00:06,564
I'll take out that one, you get
the two down on the platform.

877
01:00:25,118 --> 01:00:26,380
What is this?

878
01:00:37,365 --> 01:00:39,333
I don't even know what I did with it.

879
01:00:39,501 --> 01:00:40,798
I don't know what happened.

880
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:47,374
I don't know what I did. What did I do?

881
01:00:48,276 --> 01:00:51,336
We flew a great way out here
and it was nothing like that.

882
01:00:51,513 --> 01:00:53,777
You've got no reason to worry, boy.

883
01:00:54,115 --> 01:00:57,346
I confess, I guided you into
that twister on purpose.

884
01:00:57,519 --> 01:00:59,612
I wanted to test your gizzard.

885
01:01:00,522 --> 01:01:02,683
You were exemplary.

886
01:01:03,525 --> 01:01:04,685
"Exemplary"?

887
01:01:04,859 --> 01:01:07,327
No, no, no.
I nearly had my wings ripped off.

888
01:01:07,729 --> 01:01:11,631
You know, my head said to do one thing
while my gizzard was saying to do another.

889
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:13,495
And you trusted your head.

890
01:01:14,703 --> 01:01:16,398
Thaùs when you failed.

891
01:01:17,672 --> 01:01:20,470
Wait. Is that your mark?

892
01:01:20,742 --> 01:01:22,972
EzYLRYB:
What, this? Yes.

893
01:01:23,411 --> 01:01:27,142
<i>So you wrote the
Chronicle of the Battle of the ice Claws.</i>

894
01:01:27,315 --> 01:01:28,680
I think so.

895
01:01:28,850 --> 01:01:31,216
Well, actually, yes. I did.

896
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:33,646
- Were you there?
- Yes.

897
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:36,487
What, as a scribe?

898
01:01:36,658 --> 01:01:39,593
Well, no. As a soldier.

899
01:01:39,761 --> 01:01:43,822
As the, I guess you could say,
leader of all the soldiers.

900
01:01:44,933 --> 01:01:46,628
You're Lyze of Kiel.

901
01:01:49,137 --> 01:01:51,264
Um... Yes.

902
01:01:51,439 --> 01:01:53,430
You're Lyze of Kiel.

903
01:01:53,642 --> 01:01:55,166
Yes. Don't wear it out.

904
01:01:55,844 --> 01:01:57,004
But...

905
01:01:58,246 --> 01:01:59,838
That old thing?

906
01:02:00,015 --> 01:02:02,779
Thaùs only good
for gathering coals now.

907
01:02:02,951 --> 01:02:05,545
Yeah, but why go by Ezylryb?

908
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:07,779
All the owls of the Tree know who I am.

909
01:02:07,956 --> 01:02:09,048
But you're...

910
01:02:09,224 --> 01:02:11,590
My days as Lyze are well behind me.

911
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:14,524
And that battle is a distant memory.

912
01:02:14,696 --> 01:02:17,722
Except, funnily enough,
for young owlets like you.

913
01:02:19,301 --> 01:02:20,563
Why didn't you tell me?

914
01:02:20,735 --> 01:02:23,431
What difference does it make
what I call myself?

915
01:02:23,605 --> 01:02:25,573
Because Lyze of Kiel was my hero.

916
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:28,971
Yes, well, fancy it must be hard
meeting your hero...

917
01:02:29,177 --> 01:02:31,771
...and seeing that he's real
and not a myth.

918
01:02:32,213 --> 01:02:33,544
You're just not...

919
01:02:33,715 --> 01:02:35,205
What did you expect?

920
01:02:35,383 --> 01:02:40,719
<i>Some Tyto alba with gleaming armor and
battle claws, the moon rising behind him?</i>

921
01:02:42,223 --> 01:02:45,556
Well, this is what it looks like
when you've actually fought in battle.

922
01:02:45,727 --> 01:02:49,128
Iùs not glorious, iùs not beautiful.
And iùs not even heroic.

923
01:02:49,297 --> 01:02:50,992
Iùs merely doing whaùs right.

924
01:02:51,199 --> 01:02:55,397
And doing it again and again,
even if someday, you look like this.

925
01:02:57,272 --> 01:02:58,296
Something's wrong.

926
01:03:05,814 --> 01:03:08,749
Downed owlets, downed owlets!

927
01:03:08,917 --> 01:03:11,351
- Come fast!
Allomere is back!

928
01:03:11,519 --> 01:03:13,180
Quickly.
Make way.

929
01:03:13,355 --> 01:03:15,255
Some help here.

930
01:03:15,423 --> 01:03:17,288
These owlets need attention.

931
01:03:17,459 --> 01:03:18,756
Fetch it, quick.

932
01:03:21,596 --> 01:03:23,962
- Mommy?
- Iùs okay.

933
01:03:24,432 --> 01:03:26,127
Hey. Hey. What happened?

934
01:03:26,301 --> 01:03:28,735
Lord Allomere rescued two owlets
in the Beaks.

935
01:03:29,637 --> 01:03:31,468
It looks like he's hurt.

936
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:35,475
I think he ran into
some of your Pure Ones.

937
01:03:35,643 --> 01:03:38,737
You know, I didn't really
believe you before.

938
01:03:39,147 --> 01:03:43,083
Oh, well, thaùs okay. You know,
I wouldn't have believed me either.

939
01:03:44,252 --> 01:03:47,483
Soren! Soren, come fast, iùs Eglantine.

940
01:03:48,556 --> 01:03:50,023
Eglantine?

941
01:03:50,658 --> 01:03:52,558
Let me through! Let me pass!

942
01:03:52,761 --> 01:03:53,819
Been moon blinked.

943
01:03:57,832 --> 01:03:59,129
No.

944
01:04:01,469 --> 01:04:03,061
Do you think you can help her?

945
01:04:03,271 --> 01:04:05,068
We will do our best, Soren.

946
01:04:07,976 --> 01:04:09,409
Eglantine.

947
01:04:12,714 --> 01:04:14,147
Eglantine.

948
01:04:14,983 --> 01:04:18,180
<i>The battle was ferocious.
We were greatly outnumbered.</i>

949
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:22,251
I was only lightly wounded, thank Glaux.
But the others...

950
01:04:24,292 --> 01:04:27,227
Can you estimate the number
of enslaved owlets, Allomere?

951
01:04:27,662 --> 01:04:31,928
Scores, that I witnessed.
There may well be many more.

952
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:35,035
And you believe this is part
of a larger plan.

953
01:04:35,370 --> 01:04:36,928
It is certain.

954
01:04:37,739 --> 01:04:41,505
Your Majesty, this is no time
for half measures.

955
01:04:42,343 --> 01:04:43,867
Hmm.

956
01:04:44,546 --> 01:04:47,413
Bubo, sharpen the battle claws.

957
01:04:50,084 --> 01:04:51,415
To arms.

958
01:04:52,887 --> 01:04:54,377
To arms.

959
01:05:08,436 --> 01:05:10,267
Not a bad fit.

960
01:05:10,438 --> 01:05:12,133
Ezylryb! Lyze.

961
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:13,637
Yes to both.

962
01:05:13,842 --> 01:05:15,139
Look, I have to go.

963
01:05:15,343 --> 01:05:17,038
You have to take me with you.

964
01:05:17,212 --> 01:05:18,406
Oh, absolutely.

965
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:23,108
An untrained youth like you could last
a whole minute in a real battle.

966
01:05:23,618 --> 01:05:24,744
Here.

967
01:05:25,954 --> 01:05:28,548
Come along.
We could use the talon fodder.

968
01:05:28,723 --> 01:05:30,884
I'd love to throw some bodies
at the enemy.

969
01:05:31,059 --> 01:05:32,083
Yeah, but I'm...

970
01:05:32,260 --> 01:05:35,058
Or you could stay here...

971
01:05:35,230 --> 01:05:36,891
...tend to your sister...

972
01:05:37,065 --> 01:05:39,465
...and do some real good.

973
01:05:40,435 --> 01:05:44,269
But what do I know?
I'm just a tired old screech.

974
01:06:37,292 --> 01:06:38,623
Move.

975
01:06:52,941 --> 01:06:54,135
<i>Oh, Eglantine.</i>

976
01:06:55,376 --> 01:06:58,709
I'd trade places with you if I could.
I really would.

977
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:01,542
You know, I wish it was me lying there
instead of you.

978
01:07:01,716 --> 01:07:03,308
Oh, Soren.

979
01:07:03,484 --> 01:07:06,214
Because then you could see this place
for yourself, Eg.

980
01:07:06,387 --> 01:07:11,484
You know, Da's stories, they're true.
They're all true.

981
01:07:11,659 --> 01:07:14,651
<i>You know, the Guardians,
and the Ga'Hoole Tree, and...</i>

982
01:07:14,829 --> 01:07:16,194
<i>Iùs all true</i>

983
01:07:16,364 --> 01:07:19,891
<i>Even Lyze of Kiel. I mean, he's real, Eg.</i>

984
01:07:20,735 --> 01:07:22,032
<i>He's real.</i>

985
01:07:37,986 --> 01:07:40,614
Soren, you promised.

986
01:07:40,788 --> 01:07:41,880
Eg?

987
01:07:43,291 --> 01:07:46,692
You promised I could be Lyze
on the next go.

988
01:07:48,630 --> 01:07:51,258
- Oh, Eglantine.
- Oh, Eglantine.

989
01:07:52,867 --> 01:07:54,198
Eglantine.

990
01:07:54,702 --> 01:07:57,296
Soren? Mrs. P?

991
01:07:57,939 --> 01:08:00,373
We're... We're not at home, are we?

992
01:08:00,541 --> 01:08:02,304
We're at the Guardian's Tree, Eg.

993
01:08:02,510 --> 01:08:04,910
Look. Look, this is Ga'Hoole.

994
01:08:05,079 --> 01:08:08,776
No, it can't be. Kludd, he's still...

995
01:08:08,950 --> 01:08:12,886
Kludd was wrong. Da was right.
He was right all along, Eg.

996
01:08:13,054 --> 01:08:16,751
No, I mean Kludd was there. With me.

997
01:08:17,158 --> 01:08:20,889
He did this to me, Soren.
He's one of them.

998
01:08:21,095 --> 01:08:22,460
He what?

999
01:08:22,964 --> 01:08:24,556
No. No, Eg.

1000
01:08:24,832 --> 01:08:28,324
Look, you must be confused.
That can't be.

1001
01:08:30,672 --> 01:08:32,606
<i>Well, thank Glaux Allomere rescued you.</i>

1002
01:08:32,774 --> 01:08:34,571
<i>I wasn't rescued.</i>

1003
01:08:34,742 --> 01:08:37,768
<i>Kludd gave me to the owl
who brought me here.</i>

1004
01:08:37,945 --> 01:08:40,470
<i>No, Eg, no. Thaùs impossible.</i>

1005
01:08:40,648 --> 01:08:43,640
<i>I mean, that would mean that Allomere
would have to be a...</i>

1006
01:08:43,818 --> 01:08:45,752
<i>Be a traitor.</i>

1007
01:08:47,488 --> 01:08:48,785
No, iùs a trap.

1008
01:09:33,634 --> 01:09:34,658
Allomere!

1009
01:09:35,136 --> 01:09:36,728
Allomere!

1010
01:09:45,113 --> 01:09:49,209
We'll follow the Whale's Fin.
Iùs how they would have gone.

1011
01:10:06,501 --> 01:10:07,525
I see something.

1012
01:10:08,669 --> 01:10:09,931
There.

1013
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:14,974
We should check out that smoke.

1014
01:10:21,682 --> 01:10:23,411
Soren, look.

1015
01:10:39,567 --> 01:10:41,262
Oh, Allomere.

1016
01:10:41,602 --> 01:10:46,062
Is it different when you see
the consequences of your betrayal?

1017
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:49,437
- Must it be bats that bleed them?
- Of course.

1018
01:10:49,677 --> 01:10:53,306
They have no gizzards to be impaired
by the power of the flecks.

1019
01:10:54,115 --> 01:10:56,083
Now, my love?

1020
01:10:56,250 --> 01:10:59,617
It would be cruel to make them wait
any longer.

1021
01:11:02,957 --> 01:11:04,390
Finish them.

1022
01:11:10,331 --> 01:11:13,892
Well, we can't just leave them down there,
writhing in pain.

1023
01:11:14,068 --> 01:11:16,002
- Can we?
- No, you don't understand.

1024
01:11:16,204 --> 01:11:19,071
When we were at St. Aggie's,
we saw what those things can do.

1025
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:22,437
They do something terrible to your
gizzard. Isn't that right, Soren?

1026
01:11:23,411 --> 01:11:24,435
Soren?

1027
01:11:26,681 --> 01:11:28,740
Uh, we've got bats inbound.

1028
01:11:28,916 --> 01:11:31,817
Not to worry. I can down
a hundred of those bloodsuckers.

1029
01:11:31,986 --> 01:11:34,113
Uh... Ooh. How about a thousand?

1030
01:11:34,288 --> 01:11:37,621
Well, we won't find out sitting
on our tail feathers, will we? Come on!

1031
01:11:37,792 --> 01:11:39,657
Wait! Just wait.

1032
01:11:40,361 --> 01:11:42,090
- Of course.
- Soren, what is it?

1033
01:11:42,263 --> 01:11:44,629
The flames. Thaùs it.

1034
01:11:44,799 --> 01:11:47,029
I think I see a way to free
the Guardians.

1035
01:11:47,235 --> 01:11:49,362
No, Soren, you can't fly into fire.

1036
01:11:49,537 --> 01:11:52,005
Listen, Gylfie, I need to trust my gizzard.

1037
01:11:52,173 --> 01:11:54,164
Twilight, can you take care of the bats?

1038
01:11:54,342 --> 01:11:56,503
Friend, I'll give you as much time
as I can.

1039
01:11:56,677 --> 01:11:58,304
But hurry. And be careful.

1040
01:11:59,881 --> 01:12:01,109
Come on!

1041
01:12:06,454 --> 01:12:09,855
Twilight, I think if we're going
into battle together...

1042
01:12:10,024 --> 01:12:12,288
...you'll have to sing
your best battle song ever.

1043
01:12:12,460 --> 01:12:14,621
- What?
- No, I'm serious. I want to hear one.

1044
01:12:14,795 --> 01:12:17,787
Give us your bravest, most inspiring
battle song ever!

1045
01:12:17,965 --> 01:12:19,694
Brilliant idea, Digger!

1046
01:12:21,269 --> 01:12:24,136
<i>Into battle we do fly</i>

1047
01:12:24,305 --> 01:12:25,329
Yeah, thaùs it!

1048
01:12:25,506 --> 01:12:28,737
<i>No matter if we're going to die</i>

1049
01:12:28,910 --> 01:12:30,741
What? Is that supposed to be inspiring?

1050
01:12:30,912 --> 01:12:33,107
- Wait! We haven't gotten to the best bit!
- Oh.

1051
01:12:33,881 --> 01:12:37,476
<i>A nasty, scary death that hurts quite a lot</i>

1052
01:12:37,652 --> 01:12:40,951
<i>Even if our wlngs are ripped clean off</i>

1053
01:12:42,156 --> 01:12:44,488
No. No!

1054
01:12:44,659 --> 01:12:47,321
You told us you'd bring
all the Guardians.

1055
01:12:48,396 --> 01:12:50,557
But they're not Guardians.

1056
01:12:50,731 --> 01:12:52,028
Soren.

1057
01:12:52,199 --> 01:12:55,498
They have no chance
against the flecks.

1058
01:12:55,937 --> 01:13:00,499
Still, I don't think we can trust you
anymore, Allomere.

1059
01:13:00,675 --> 01:13:02,006
No.

1060
01:13:02,176 --> 01:13:04,736
No, no, you promised me.

1061
01:13:04,912 --> 01:13:07,813
You promised me I would be
King of the Tree!

1062
01:13:10,685 --> 01:13:13,176
You should know, Allomere...

1063
01:13:13,354 --> 01:13:16,448
...there is only room for one king.

1064
01:13:27,435 --> 01:13:28,595
Hey!

1065
01:13:43,351 --> 01:13:44,750
Fly away!

1066
01:13:50,391 --> 01:13:52,484
<i>Use your glizzard, boy!</i>

1067
01:13:52,660 --> 01:13:56,152
<i>Fly inside.</i>

1068
01:15:06,233 --> 01:15:07,222
Soren!

1069
01:15:10,805 --> 01:15:11,863
No!

1070
01:15:43,104 --> 01:15:44,435
Oh, Soren.

1071
01:15:56,550 --> 01:15:58,074
Come on, Soren.

1072
01:15:58,252 --> 01:16:02,348
That was exemplary.
But we're not finished yet, boy.

1073
01:16:03,023 --> 01:16:04,854
Oh, yeah! Woo-hoo!

1074
01:16:08,696 --> 01:16:10,129
Come on.

1075
01:16:10,297 --> 01:16:11,855
I bet you didn't count on this.

1076
01:16:17,571 --> 01:16:20,540
Ha, ha! Good job, my friends!

1077
01:16:26,514 --> 01:16:28,880
Pure Ones, attack!

1078
01:16:29,416 --> 01:16:30,883
Crush them!

1079
01:16:31,118 --> 01:16:33,609
Before they can recover!

1080
01:16:35,656 --> 01:16:39,251
Guardians, we must uphold our oath.

1081
01:16:39,426 --> 01:16:40,950
To battle!

1082
01:16:43,063 --> 01:16:45,463
I need you to stay here
with your friends...

1083
01:16:45,633 --> 01:16:48,101
...and guard these owlets.
- Huh?

1084
01:17:30,844 --> 01:17:32,436
Unh! Ha, ha!

1085
01:17:32,613 --> 01:17:34,205
Come on!

1086
01:18:15,789 --> 01:18:16,983
Kludd?

1087
01:18:21,228 --> 01:18:22,354
No.

1088
01:18:22,696 --> 01:18:24,254
Soren!

1089
01:18:34,541 --> 01:18:35,838
Kludd!

1090
01:18:50,557 --> 01:18:52,024
Hello, brother.

1091
01:18:58,899 --> 01:19:00,594
Hmm?

1092
01:19:07,508 --> 01:19:12,207
Well, the legendary Lyze of Kiel.

1093
01:19:12,813 --> 01:19:17,375
Once again, iùs come down
to just you and me.

1094
01:19:18,786 --> 01:19:23,382
And now I can take my vengeance
for this.

1095
01:19:23,624 --> 01:19:27,321
You should thank me.
It appears to be an improvement.

1096
01:20:12,573 --> 01:20:15,701
Your precious Guardians
are finished, Soren.

1097
01:20:17,711 --> 01:20:19,110
The Pure Ones will triumph...

1098
01:20:19,613 --> 01:20:24,448
...and Tytos will take their rightful place
as rulers of the owl kingdoms.

1099
01:20:24,618 --> 01:20:27,052
Oh, iùs gonna be glorious!

1100
01:20:32,192 --> 01:20:33,216
"Glorious"?

1101
01:20:34,194 --> 01:20:37,459
No, the Pure Ones are monsters.
You saw what they were doing.

1102
01:20:37,631 --> 01:20:40,794
They were moon blinking other owls
and turning them into slaves.

1103
01:20:40,968 --> 01:20:44,165
You're just weak, Soren.
Still living in your dreams.

1104
01:20:45,305 --> 01:20:47,796
No, my dreams are what
make me strong, Kludd.

1105
01:20:47,975 --> 01:20:50,500
- They led me to the Guardians.
- Ha-ha-ha.

1106
01:20:50,677 --> 01:20:53,407
A pity there won't be any Guardians
left after today.

1107
01:20:57,050 --> 01:20:58,347
I don't understand.

1108
01:20:58,519 --> 01:21:01,317
How could you join the Pure Ones
after what they did to us?

1109
01:21:01,488 --> 01:21:03,012
"What they did to us"?

1110
01:21:03,190 --> 01:21:06,057
They believe in me
like no one else ever has.

1111
01:21:06,827 --> 01:21:10,024
Metal Beak says
the strong will triumph...

1112
01:21:10,197 --> 01:21:12,495
...the broken are put out of their misery.

1113
01:21:13,066 --> 01:21:14,192
And honor...

1114
01:21:14,368 --> 01:21:17,269
...honor is just another word
for weakness!

1115
01:21:17,438 --> 01:21:20,032
No, Kludd!
I know you don't really think that.

1116
01:21:20,741 --> 01:21:23,266
Then you don't know me at all.

1117
01:21:32,419 --> 01:21:35,388
Soren! My wing's broken! Help me up!

1118
01:21:38,592 --> 01:21:40,890
Soren, I'm your brother.

1119
01:22:03,884 --> 01:22:05,215
Kludd, no!

1120
01:22:16,930 --> 01:22:18,420
Metal Beak.

1121
01:22:43,290 --> 01:22:45,724
Be done with it, then.

1122
01:22:47,194 --> 01:22:48,559
No!

1123
01:22:55,636 --> 01:22:58,332
I'm not letting you hurt one more soul.

1124
01:22:58,505 --> 01:23:01,099
Oh, you're not letting me?

1125
01:23:01,275 --> 01:23:03,709
Oh, what a pity to waste...

1126
01:23:03,877 --> 01:23:07,779
...such a strong, young
and confident Tyto.

1127
01:23:09,783 --> 01:23:11,774
No, Soren!

1128
01:23:11,952 --> 01:23:15,012
Oh. You know this sad old owl.

1129
01:23:15,188 --> 01:23:18,123
He's my teacher. My hero.

1130
01:23:18,292 --> 01:23:23,457
Well, your hero can teach you one
last lesson about Pure Ones' strength...

1131
01:23:23,630 --> 01:23:24,892
Don't move.

1132
01:23:25,065 --> 01:23:27,932
...by letting you watch him die.

1133
01:24:18,619 --> 01:24:20,280
Hmm.

1134
01:24:20,454 --> 01:24:23,150
Unh!
Ha, ha.

1135
01:24:40,107 --> 01:24:42,575
Pure Ones! Fall back!

1136
01:24:42,743 --> 01:24:43,869
To me!

1137
01:25:05,399 --> 01:25:07,867
Soren, you did what was right.

1138
01:25:08,935 --> 01:25:10,766
And you did it well.

1139
01:25:12,973 --> 01:25:16,534
<i>It seems we will have to amend
the Chronicles. Huh?</i>

1140
01:25:20,147 --> 01:25:22,775
<i>As it was in the old ages...</i>

1141
01:25:22,949 --> 01:25:25,008
<i>...so it was in the new.</i>

1142
01:25:25,452 --> 01:25:28,114
<i>The Guardians upheld their oath
that night.</i>

1143
01:25:28,288 --> 01:25:31,223
I foretold you so!

1144
01:25:31,391 --> 01:25:35,157
<i>They made strong the weak
and mended the broken.</i>

1145
01:25:35,328 --> 01:25:37,353
<i>And when the sun shone again
that morning...</i>

1146
01:25:37,531 --> 01:25:40,591
<i>...all could see that
they had vanquished the evil.</i>

1147
01:25:45,839 --> 01:25:48,069
Soren! Soren!

1148
01:25:49,609 --> 01:25:51,008
- Oh, Eg.
- Ha, ha!

1149
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:54,377
Are there any casualties?

1150
01:25:54,548 --> 01:25:57,278
- We're so proud of you.
- Ha, ha!

1151
01:25:57,451 --> 01:26:00,443
- Da, the stories...
- Ha, ha.

1152
01:26:00,620 --> 01:26:02,053
...they're real.

1153
01:26:02,522 --> 01:26:04,956
You made them real, Soren.

1154
01:26:11,832 --> 01:26:13,732
<i>With the peace restored...</i>

1155
01:26:13,934 --> 01:26:16,061
<i>...it was a time for celebration...</i>

1156
01:26:16,236 --> 01:26:19,797
<i>...and recognition
that our small band of owls...</i>

1157
01:26:19,973 --> 01:26:23,136
<i>...who fate and a storm had blown
into the Tree...</i>

1158
01:26:23,310 --> 01:26:28,646
<i>...now stood before its king and queen
as young Guardians.</i>

1159
01:26:46,466 --> 01:26:49,230
<i>Eady finally, with all their hearts...</i>

1160
01:26:49,402 --> 01:26:51,768
<i>...to take that ancient oath:</i>

1161
01:26:52,472 --> 01:26:55,100
<i>To mend those who are broken...</i>

1162
01:26:55,275 --> 01:26:57,505
<i>...to make strong the weak...</i>

1163
01:26:57,677 --> 01:26:59,668
<i>...and, without hesitation...</i>

1164
01:26:59,846 --> 01:27:02,337
<i>...vanquish the evil.</i>

1165
01:27:03,216 --> 01:27:04,706
<i>For as we know...</i>

1166
01:27:04,885 --> 01:27:06,876
<i>...Nyra escaped.</i>

1167
01:27:08,054 --> 01:27:09,419
<i>And Kludd?</i>

1168
01:27:10,991 --> 01:27:13,084
<i>Well, Kiudd was never found.</i>

1169
01:27:14,494 --> 01:27:15,756
Should I stop?

1170
01:27:15,929 --> 01:27:18,227
What? Please, don't stop.

1171
01:27:18,398 --> 01:27:20,366
I don't wanna give anyone daymares.

1172
01:27:20,534 --> 01:27:23,367
Oh, come on.
There must be more, there must be.

1173
01:27:23,537 --> 01:27:25,596
Ha, ha. Listen to them, Soren.

1174
01:27:26,907 --> 01:27:28,272
They want more stories.

1175
01:27:30,777 --> 01:27:33,974
Well, come on, you lot.
Leùs not disappoint them.

1176
01:27:34,815 --> 01:27:37,716
Ah. There's a good storm brewing.

1177
01:27:37,884 --> 01:27:42,048
And if we're lucky,
iùll be chock full of baggywrinkles.

1178
01:28:00,405 --> 01:28:20,032
