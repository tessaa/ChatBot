1
00:00:40,168 --> 00:00:43,240
Good for you,
Pete. Good for you.

2
00:01:17,168 --> 00:01:18,468
Access Hollywood spotlight...

3
00:01:18,568 --> 00:01:21,188
on sexy crime fighter
Sarah Marshall.

4
00:01:21,288 --> 00:01:22,279
Hi, everybody, welcome...

5
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:23,828
to Access Hollywood.
I'm Billy Bush.

6
00:01:23,928 --> 00:01:26,148
Each week, millions of
viewers love to watch

7
00:01:26,248 --> 00:01:28,168
Ms Marshall's brainy
sexpot character.

8
00:01:28,268 --> 00:01:29,268
Maddy Stark,

9
00:01:29,368 --> 00:01:32,188
alongside Billy Baldwin's
dark and brooding,

10
00:01:32,288 --> 00:01:34,428
hard-to-love lead
detective, Hunter Rush....

11
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:36,673
- And this isn't
your jurisdiction.

12
00:01:36,773 --> 00:01:38,668
I just made it
my jurisdiction.

13
00:01:38,768 --> 00:01:41,043
Can you say 'catfight'?

14
00:01:42,648 --> 00:01:44,308
Off-screen, Sarah cosies up...

15
00:01:44,408 --> 00:01:46,230
to her successful
composer boyfriend.

16
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:46,988
Peter Bretter.

17
00:01:47,088 --> 00:01:48,228
He's no household name,

18
00:01:48,328 --> 00:01:50,878
yet Bretter's dark and
ominous score has...

19
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:53,468
set the tone for this
gruesome juggernaut.

20
00:01:53,568 --> 00:01:55,568
Take a look.

21
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,368
What do you think?

22
00:02:00,848 --> 00:02:02,814
I think it's gonna be hard...

23
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:05,228
for her to re-enter
the pageant...

24
00:02:05,328 --> 00:02:07,328
without a face.

25
00:02:11,448 --> 00:02:14,548
Looks like the sky's the limit
for this adorable couple.

26
00:02:14,648 --> 00:02:16,773
Anything could happen....

27
00:02:19,048 --> 00:02:25,317
We got to do something
We got to do something

28
00:02:25,448 --> 00:02:28,028
Before Mother Earth
gets any more hurt

29
00:02:28,128 --> 00:02:29,948
We got to do something

30
00:02:30,048 --> 00:02:31,877
We leave you tonight
with the newest...

31
00:02:31,977 --> 00:02:33,468
smash single from
Infant Sorrow.

32
00:02:33,568 --> 00:02:35,834
Lead singer and
notorious lothario.

33
00:02:35,934 --> 00:02:38,068
Aldous Snow, begs
us to change...

34
00:02:38,168 --> 00:02:41,108
in his environmental anthem,
We've Got to Do Something.

35
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:43,688
I hope, for once, we
all hear the message.

36
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:44,788
Good night.

37
00:02:44,888 --> 00:02:47,393
Mr Prime Minister
and Mr President

38
00:02:47,493 --> 00:02:50,148
You better see that
it's not only me

39
00:02:50,248 --> 00:02:52,493
No, a mob is rising in size

40
00:02:52,593 --> 00:02:55,313
And they've been
dying to scream

41
00:02:56,368 --> 00:02:58,368
Hey, baby.

42
00:02:59,528 --> 00:03:01,528
Just working.

43
00:03:02,608 --> 00:03:04,608
Salad.

44
00:03:04,688 --> 00:03:07,760
Oh, yeah. Yeah,
yeah, yeah. Totally.

45
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:08,875
I didn't realise that...

46
00:03:08,975 --> 00:03:10,308
you were gonna be
back so early.

47
00:03:10,408 --> 00:03:12,873
Great. I'll see you in a bit.

48
00:03:13,488 --> 00:03:15,763
Okay, bye.

49
00:03:16,448 --> 00:03:19,121
It's time to do something

50
00:03:19,248 --> 00:03:24,959
Someone should do something
We got to do something

51
00:03:25,088 --> 00:03:27,673
And that someone
is you and you

52
00:03:27,773 --> 00:03:29,773
And you and you

53
00:03:29,888 --> 00:03:32,693
I pray it ain't
all lost and gone

54
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:38,438
I pray we might learn
right from wrong

55
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:46,167
And I pray this broken day
will not last too long

56
00:03:54,688 --> 00:03:59,079
Hey, you got here fast.
I got a surprise for you.

57
00:04:02,608 --> 00:04:04,608
Peter, as you know.

58
00:04:05,768 --> 00:04:08,601
I love you very much.

59
00:04:12,768 --> 00:04:15,148
Are you breaking up with me?

60
00:04:20,448 --> 00:04:23,997
- Pete, are you...
- I just need a minute.

61
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:27,848
Okay.

62
00:04:45,728 --> 00:04:46,708
Please don't go.

63
00:04:46,808 --> 00:04:48,185
Why don't you just
put on some clothes,

64
00:04:48,285 --> 00:04:49,588
and we can sit down
and discuss this.

65
00:04:49,688 --> 00:04:50,948
No. I can't do
anything right now.

66
00:04:51,048 --> 00:04:53,048
I'm so sorry, Pete.

67
00:04:53,488 --> 00:04:54,628
I'm in love with you.

68
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:56,308
Why don't you just
put some clothes on, okay?

69
00:04:56,408 --> 00:04:58,068
I'm not going to
go put clothes on.

70
00:04:58,168 --> 00:05:00,073
I know what that means,

71
00:05:00,173 --> 00:05:03,318
if I put clothes
on, it's over. Okay?

72
00:05:04,168 --> 00:05:06,168
Excuse me.

73
00:05:11,968 --> 00:05:14,773
Let's talk. Let's
talk about him.

74
00:05:16,808 --> 00:05:18,808
I feel...

75
00:05:19,928 --> 00:05:21,928
I've been feeling...

76
00:05:22,888 --> 00:05:26,713
for a long time
that we've been growing apart.

77
00:05:26,808 --> 00:05:29,358
We're leading different lives.

78
00:05:31,128 --> 00:05:33,128
Who's the dude?

79
00:05:33,888 --> 00:05:34,988
- Who's the dude?
- What?

80
00:05:35,088 --> 00:05:37,645
No, that's not what
this is about.

81
00:05:37,745 --> 00:05:39,228
There's no one else.

82
00:05:39,328 --> 00:05:41,428
I know what's happening
here. I really do.

83
00:05:41,528 --> 00:05:43,222
You've been working so
much lately, that we...

84
00:05:43,322 --> 00:05:44,788
haven't got to spend
much time together,

85
00:05:44,888 --> 00:05:46,108
and you're forgetting
what it's like to be with me.

86
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:47,743
But maybe, if we just
held each other...

87
00:05:47,843 --> 00:05:48,308
or something,

88
00:05:48,408 --> 00:05:49,868
you would remember
what it's like to be with me.

89
00:05:49,968 --> 00:05:51,968
- No.
- Just hold me.

90
00:05:56,448 --> 00:05:58,564
Please. Here we go.

91
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,448
There's someone else.

92
00:06:09,528 --> 00:06:11,528
I'm sorry.

93
00:06:27,768 --> 00:06:30,568
We don't hang out in
places like this.

94
00:06:30,668 --> 00:06:31,668
Liz and I.

95
00:06:31,768 --> 00:06:33,099
Why did you take me here?

96
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,468
This place smells like
stripper's perfume.

97
00:06:35,568 --> 00:06:37,032
I'm gonna get herpes...

98
00:06:37,132 --> 00:06:39,188
just from sitting
on this couch.

99
00:06:39,288 --> 00:06:41,708
- Sure you okay, bro? Yeah?
- Yeah.

100
00:06:41,808 --> 00:06:43,288
Yeah. You don't have
to keep asking me.

101
00:06:43,388 --> 00:06:44,388
I'm good.

102
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:45,001
- You're out.

103
00:06:45,101 --> 00:06:46,868
Thank you so much for
this opportunity....

104
00:06:46,968 --> 00:06:50,028
- Auf Wiedersehen.
- Auf Wiedersehen.

105
00:06:50,328 --> 00:06:52,068
MAN ON T. V..:
Thank you. Thank you all....

106
00:06:52,168 --> 00:06:54,168
 Auf Wiedersehen.

107
00:06:55,257 --> 00:06:56,957
I feel really
good. I feel happy.

108
00:06:57,057 --> 00:06:59,837
Maybe you should work
on the Dracula musical.

109
00:06:59,937 --> 00:07:01,658
Look, you've been working
on it for a while.

110
00:07:01,758 --> 00:07:03,077
It'll help your
mind. Be creative.

111
00:07:03,177 --> 00:07:03,782
- Think about you.

112
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:04,997
I think I need to
fuck somebody.

113
00:07:05,097 --> 00:07:06,237
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

114
00:07:06,337 --> 00:07:08,061
You're not my
stepbrother any more.

115
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:09,277
You're a step-stranger.

116
00:07:09,377 --> 00:07:10,837
- Why you talking like that?
- Brian.

117
00:07:10,937 --> 00:07:12,837
You don't need to put
your P in a V right now.

118
00:07:12,937 --> 00:07:13,968
No, I don't.

119
00:07:14,068 --> 00:07:17,169
I need to B my L
on somebody's T's.

120
00:07:17,297 --> 00:07:18,104
That's disgusting.

121
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:19,677
You don't need to
be doing that.

122
00:07:19,777 --> 00:07:20,511
And if anything.

123
00:07:20,611 --> 00:07:22,277
you should leave
your P in the V...

124
00:07:22,377 --> 00:07:25,837
and blow it inside the V.
so you can have a B-A-B-Y...

125
00:07:25,937 --> 00:07:27,117
and be a normal person.

126
00:07:27,217 --> 00:07:28,957
I'm leaving, man.
I'm out of here.

127
00:07:29,057 --> 00:07:30,402
She's fucking somebody.

128
00:07:30,502 --> 00:07:32,757
Okay, Bri? It's all
I can think about,

129
00:07:32,857 --> 00:07:34,117
is that she's out there,

130
00:07:34,217 --> 00:07:35,435
and until I do the same thing,

131
00:07:35,535 --> 00:07:36,837
I'm gonna feel
like I wanna die.

132
00:07:36,937 --> 00:07:39,657
So just talk to girls
with me tonight,

133
00:07:39,757 --> 00:07:40,757
all right?

134
00:07:40,857 --> 00:07:43,783
All right. All right,
I'll help you out.

135
00:07:43,883 --> 00:07:45,917
I'll talk to girls with you.

136
00:07:46,017 --> 00:07:47,877
So, Peter, what do you do?

137
00:07:47,977 --> 00:07:49,357
Musician.

138
00:07:49,457 --> 00:07:50,937
He's being modest.

139
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:54,217
He works on a show
called Crime Scene.

140
00:07:54,317 --> 00:07:55,917
Oh, my God.

141
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,717
- It is what it is, you know?
- No, I love that show.

142
00:07:58,817 --> 00:08:00,630
Wait, Crime Scene:
Scene of the Crime...

143
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,797
or Crime Scene: Phoenix?

144
00:08:01,897 --> 00:08:03,703
- Scene of the Crime.

145
00:08:03,803 --> 00:08:06,317
Oh, my God. I love that show.

146
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:10,222
I find you both very
sexually attractive.

147
00:08:11,137 --> 00:08:13,697
Let's pump the brakes. Okay?

148
00:08:13,817 --> 00:08:16,037
I think that having sex
with either of you...

149
00:08:16,137 --> 00:08:18,687
would be a great treat for me.

150
00:08:18,777 --> 00:08:20,777
You are so funny.

151
00:08:21,857 --> 00:08:22,671
I just got out of...

152
00:08:22,771 --> 00:08:24,277
a five-and-a-half-year
relationship,

153
00:08:24,377 --> 00:08:27,437
so I'm not looking
for anything serious.

154
00:08:27,537 --> 00:08:31,702
- Just sexual activity.
- Let's wrap it up, buddy.

155
00:08:31,817 --> 00:08:33,817
You wanna come home?

156
00:08:35,177 --> 00:08:37,717
I'm sorry, you're
cracking me up.

157
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:39,317
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

158
00:08:39,417 --> 00:08:41,417
Do you wanna come home?

159
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:43,897
Stop it, seriously.

160
00:08:49,377 --> 00:08:52,369
- That was fun.
- Yeah, yeah.

161
00:08:53,137 --> 00:08:56,962
Overall, I think that
went really well. Yeah.

162
00:09:05,257 --> 00:09:07,637
I want to have sex with you.

163
00:09:15,417 --> 00:09:17,851
- Are you crying?
- What? No.

164
00:09:18,937 --> 00:09:22,293
I'm sorry that I'm
being so weird now.

165
00:09:22,617 --> 00:09:24,617
No, that's okay.

166
00:09:24,937 --> 00:09:26,937
You've been weird...

167
00:09:27,417 --> 00:09:32,366
pretty much the whole time,
so it's not unusual. Okay.

168
00:09:32,857 --> 00:09:35,795
Last night, like some sort
of idiot, I had sex...

169
00:09:35,895 --> 00:09:38,224
with this woman who
I barely even know.

170
00:09:38,324 --> 00:09:40,394
I used a condom, but

171
00:09:41,484 --> 00:09:44,504
I'm really scared that
I have an STD, Doc.

172
00:09:44,604 --> 00:09:46,856
Peter, I'm a paediatrician.
Have you noticed...

173
00:09:46,956 --> 00:09:48,424
you're sitting
on a fire truck?

174
00:09:48,524 --> 00:09:50,304
- Right.
- Little kids running?

175
00:09:50,404 --> 00:09:52,304
- Yeah, this is
new. I like it.

176
00:09:52,404 --> 00:09:53,864
I'm kind of backed up...

177
00:09:53,964 --> 00:09:56,854
Could you take a
look at my penis?

178
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:00,064
Go ahead. Let me see it.

179
00:10:00,164 --> 00:10:01,164
- Sorry.

180
00:10:01,264 --> 00:10:03,814
That's all right. Take it out.

181
00:10:04,244 --> 00:10:05,704
Good.

182
00:10:05,804 --> 00:10:06,713
- You barely looked at it.

183
00:10:06,813 --> 00:10:07,944
It's a good-looking
dick, Peter.

184
00:10:08,044 --> 00:10:08,521
- Beautiful dick.

185
00:10:08,621 --> 00:10:09,624
Do you think maybe
while I'm here,

186
00:10:09,724 --> 00:10:11,864
- I could get some blood work?
- Peter.

187
00:10:11,964 --> 00:10:13,790
Your girlfriend
dumped you, right?

188
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,496
Are you hurting? Are you hurt?

189
00:10:15,596 --> 00:10:17,500
Stop it. Stop crying.
Use your dick.

190
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,776
Keep fucking. Fuck
everything that moves.

191
00:10:19,876 --> 00:10:20,896
Just wear a condom.

192
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:22,200
Listen, I'm backed up,

193
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,416
I got a lot of kids.
I gotta go, okay?

194
00:10:24,516 --> 00:10:26,081
You want something?

195
00:10:26,181 --> 00:10:29,326
You want a balloon?
You want a lolly?

196
00:10:37,516 --> 00:10:39,516
I just came.

197
00:10:54,516 --> 00:10:56,516
Hi.

198
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,480
Hi.

199
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,775
- Hi.
- Hi.

200
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,980
Hi.

201
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,815
- Hi.
- Hi.

202
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:12,466
Okay, do you mind
not saying that...

203
00:11:12,566 --> 00:11:14,566
over and over again?

204
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,460
You can gag me.

205
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,360
- You brought a gag?
- And handcuffs.

206
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,820
Do you wanna gag me?

207
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,260
Kind of, now.

208
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,300
What've we got today?

209
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,100
Just a walk and
talk at the lab.

210
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,240
That's what 20 years on
Vice will do to you.

211
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,800
What've we got here?

212
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:49,240
The victim's penis was found
behind the AC unit.

213
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,880
Ouch.

214
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,050
Can you say 'dicksicle'?

215
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,540
Let's do this.

216
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,940
Okay, I'm ready.

217
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:05,295
The victim's penis
was found behind the AC unit.

218
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,427
Just go with the
usual stuff, maybe.

219
00:12:09,527 --> 00:12:10,720
Something dark and ominous.

220
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:14,050
Like losing your
penis is a bad thing.

221
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,490
Oh, you want dark and ominous.

222
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,344
Come on, I got Allman
Brother tickets.

223
00:12:21,444 --> 00:12:23,120
I gotta get out of here.

224
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,960
That's what 20 years on
Vice will do to you.

225
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,080
What've we got here?

226
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,280
Peter. Peter, Jesus Christ.

227
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:34,520
You're fucking Billy
Baldwin, aren't you?

228
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,560
- Aren't you?
- Pete, Pete, Pete.

229
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,040
- Stop staring at me.
- Pete.

230
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,404
You know you're
not getting paid...

231
00:12:42,504 --> 00:12:43,560
for today's session, right?

232
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:46,890
- I'm aware of that.
- Fucking asshole.

233
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,100
Peter, it's Brian.

234
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,300
Go away.

235
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,640
Listen, your
landlord called me.

236
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,280
Said there's smoke
coming out of your place.

237
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:59,270
Who, Mr Lopez?
'Cause he's a liar.

238
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,920
He doesn't...

239
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,840
We worry about you, Petey.

240
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,200
Yeah, come on, Peter.
Open up the door.

241
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:08,053
The fire marshal's
gonna come in...

242
00:13:08,153 --> 00:13:10,153
and bust it down.

243
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,120
You haven't been
out of the house in two weeks.

244
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,240
Why are you so damn strong?

245
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,774
I feel so strong.

246
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:23,920
Hey, don't walk away from me.
You come close.

247
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,760
Your place is
disgusting, Peter.

248
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:27,840
Hey, don't walk away from me.

249
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,940
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey.

250
00:13:30,762 --> 00:13:32,502
What are you burning,
man? Come on.

251
00:13:32,602 --> 00:13:33,622
It's everything.

252
00:13:33,722 --> 00:13:35,435
It's everything that
reminds me of her...

253
00:13:35,535 --> 00:13:36,302
and I need it gone.

254
00:13:36,402 --> 00:13:38,412
Okay, I thought I
was fine, Brian,

255
00:13:38,512 --> 00:13:40,462
and I'm not. I'm
not fine at all.

256
00:13:40,562 --> 00:13:43,302
Okay, let's just put
the picture down.

257
00:13:43,402 --> 00:13:46,257
Put that down.
Let's discuss this.

258
00:13:46,357 --> 00:13:48,422
- I love her, man.
- I know.

259
00:13:48,522 --> 00:13:54,040
Look, Liz and I, we
think the world of Sarah.

260
00:13:54,162 --> 00:13:56,162
We think she's great.

261
00:13:56,442 --> 00:13:58,442
Okay, but everything...

262
00:13:58,842 --> 00:14:00,422
I'm just being honest here.

263
00:14:00,522 --> 00:14:04,177
Every time she would come over
to our house,

264
00:14:04,762 --> 00:14:06,762
she always acted,

265
00:14:07,522 --> 00:14:10,673
you know, like a little bitch.

266
00:14:11,842 --> 00:14:13,622
Okay, okay, pump the brakes.

267
00:14:13,722 --> 00:14:16,862
Dating Sarah is not
like dating Liz. Okay?

268
00:14:16,962 --> 00:14:18,822
Sarah is better than Liz.

269
00:14:18,922 --> 00:14:22,292
You really wanna have
this conversation?

270
00:14:22,392 --> 00:14:25,962
Do you really
wanna have this conversation?

271
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,302
Yes.

272
00:14:27,402 --> 00:14:28,895
- She is the mother
of my unborn child.

273
00:14:28,995 --> 00:14:29,182
Sorry.

274
00:14:29,282 --> 00:14:32,102
You're my stepbrother.
We're not even blood.

275
00:14:32,202 --> 00:14:33,692
I have no qualms
with sticking you.

276
00:14:33,792 --> 00:14:34,622
I will equalize you.

277
00:14:34,722 --> 00:14:36,462
- Sorry.
- You dick.

278
00:14:36,562 --> 00:14:38,562
I'm just worked up.

279
00:14:38,802 --> 00:14:41,462
You gotta get your
shit together, man.

280
00:14:41,562 --> 00:14:44,367
I'm trying to.
It's so hard here.

281
00:14:45,002 --> 00:14:46,662
Brian, everywhere I look,
I'm reminded of her, okay?

282
00:14:46,762 --> 00:14:49,435
Like, she got me this,

283
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:51,948
okay, because I
would always leave...

284
00:14:52,048 --> 00:14:53,062
my cereal boxes open,

285
00:14:53,162 --> 00:14:54,462
and the cereal
would get stale,

286
00:14:54,562 --> 00:14:55,729
and so one day I came home,

287
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:57,222
and she had this
waiting for me,

288
00:14:57,322 --> 00:15:00,077
because it keeps
my cereal fresh.

289
00:15:00,177 --> 00:15:03,152
And now I have the
freshest cereal.

290
00:15:04,562 --> 00:15:05,017
Why don't you,

291
00:15:05,117 --> 00:15:06,222
you know what, go
on a vacation?

292
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,942
Go to the Alps.

293
00:15:08,042 --> 00:15:10,782
- Alps?
- Go to Gstaad. It's the best.

294
00:15:10,882 --> 00:15:12,142
I could go to Hawaii.

295
00:15:12,242 --> 00:15:13,602
Sarah was always talking
about this place...

296
00:15:13,702 --> 00:15:14,902
in Hawaii that was
supposed to be nice.

297
00:15:15,002 --> 00:15:16,622
No, don't. I
wouldn't go there.

298
00:15:16,722 --> 00:15:18,496
What, I can't go to
Hawaii now, because

299
00:15:18,596 --> 00:15:20,182
Sarah Marshall has
heard of Hawaii?

300
00:15:20,282 --> 00:15:22,992
Then go to Hawaii.
Go to Hawaii.

301
00:15:23,092 --> 00:15:25,092
Do it.

302
00:15:29,722 --> 00:15:31,582
No, no, no, don't
destroy the computer.

303
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:32,942
I'm just deleting
these pictures.

304
00:15:33,042 --> 00:15:35,932
Okay, I need them
off my computer.

305
00:15:36,922 --> 00:15:38,732
You know what? You're
not even doing...

306
00:15:38,832 --> 00:15:40,022
a proper permanent delete.

307
00:15:40,122 --> 00:15:41,302
Well...

308
00:15:41,402 --> 00:15:42,762
If we end up getting
back together.

309
00:15:42,862 --> 00:15:44,102
I wanna have a
few of them left.

310
00:15:44,202 --> 00:15:46,202
You're crazy.

311
00:15:46,974 --> 00:15:49,993
- No, no, please
don't delete them.

312
00:15:50,093 --> 00:15:52,499
They have to go. Done, done.

313
00:16:02,014 --> 00:16:04,369
That was hilarious. Aloha.

314
00:16:04,574 --> 00:16:06,448
I'm Sarah Marshall
from Crime Scene:

315
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:07,514
Scene of the crime.

316
00:16:07,614 --> 00:16:08,995
And when I'm not
scrubbing for evidence.

317
00:16:09,095 --> 00:16:10,154
I'm flying Hawaiian
Airlines...

318
00:16:10,254 --> 00:16:11,234
Excuse me. Hi.

319
00:16:11,334 --> 00:16:12,634
...to my favourite
destinations. Mahalo.

320
00:16:12,734 --> 00:16:15,674
Hi, can I have another
bloody mary, please?

321
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:17,794
You're still
working on that one.

322
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:20,314
It's just an
anticipatory order.

323
00:16:20,414 --> 00:16:22,539
Okay, I'll be right back.

324
00:16:33,694 --> 00:16:35,754
What do you think caused
such excessive bleeding?

325
00:16:35,854 --> 00:16:38,812
He was either stabbed
in the aorta...

326
00:16:38,912 --> 00:16:41,632
or it was his time
of the month.

327
00:16:51,117 --> 00:16:53,117
Aloha.

328
00:16:53,317 --> 00:16:55,317
Check in this way.

329
00:17:05,477 --> 00:17:08,097
- Just married?
- Yes, how did you guess?

330
00:17:08,197 --> 00:17:11,522
Oh, you've got that
magic newlywed dust...

331
00:17:11,622 --> 00:17:12,577
all over you.

332
00:17:12,677 --> 00:17:15,177
- Oh, my wife.
- Oh, my husband.

333
00:17:15,277 --> 00:17:16,937
- Oh, my wife.
- My husband.

334
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:19,037
My old ball and chain.

335
00:17:22,957 --> 00:17:25,762
You quit squirming
and come here.

336
00:17:26,117 --> 00:17:28,117
What is into you?

337
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,337
Not me, yet.

338
00:17:30,437 --> 00:17:34,297
Here is your room key.
So you're all set. Room 222.

339
00:17:34,397 --> 00:17:35,060
Room key's inside,

340
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,497
and the elevators
are to the right.

341
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:37,617
Mahalo.

342
00:17:37,717 --> 00:17:39,717
Congratulations.

343
00:17:41,757 --> 00:17:43,737
Here you go, sir.
Have some POG juice.

344
00:17:43,837 --> 00:17:45,737
Welcome to Turtle Bay.
What can I do for you?

345
00:17:45,837 --> 00:17:46,473
I'm checking in.

346
00:17:46,573 --> 00:17:47,937
My name's Bretter,
Peter Bretter,

347
00:17:48,037 --> 00:17:50,617
but actually, I don't
have a reservation.

348
00:17:50,717 --> 00:17:53,692
I just thought I'd
take my chances.

349
00:17:54,397 --> 00:17:56,137
Bold.

350
00:17:56,237 --> 00:17:57,481
We are all booked up,

351
00:17:57,581 --> 00:18:00,057
but we do have the
Kapua suite available.

352
00:18:00,157 --> 00:18:03,617
- Okay. How much is that?
- $6,000 a night.

353
00:18:03,717 --> 00:18:05,757
- Wow.
- Beautiful views.

354
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:06,312
I can imagine.

355
00:18:06,412 --> 00:18:07,817
That's a little bit
out of my price range.

356
00:18:07,917 --> 00:18:09,617
Sorry.

357
00:18:09,717 --> 00:18:12,947
That's a shame. This
is a beautiful...

358
00:18:13,837 --> 00:18:15,657
hotel.

359
00:18:15,757 --> 00:18:19,097
Oh, yeah, it's Sarah Marshall
from Crime Scene.

360
00:18:19,197 --> 00:18:22,172
People are excited
that she's here.

361
00:18:22,517 --> 00:18:25,577
She's my ex-girlfriend.
We broke up three weeks ago.

362
00:18:25,677 --> 00:18:27,817
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Right. This is fine, right?

363
00:18:27,917 --> 00:18:28,917
- Sir?

364
00:18:29,017 --> 00:18:32,247
It's totally fine.
Okay, there she is.

365
00:18:32,997 --> 00:18:34,717
- Did she see me? Is
she coming over here?

366
00:18:34,817 --> 00:18:35,817
Uh-huh. Yup.

367
00:18:35,917 --> 00:18:37,537
I wish I wasn't wearing
this fucking shirt.

368
00:18:37,637 --> 00:18:38,637
Fair enough.

369
00:18:38,737 --> 00:18:41,542
Why don't you try
to unbutton it?

370
00:18:42,077 --> 00:18:44,077
Button it back up.

371
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:46,917
- Peter.
- Hey.

372
00:18:47,077 --> 00:18:49,537
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

373
00:18:49,637 --> 00:18:51,677
Came here to murder you.

374
00:18:52,077 --> 00:18:54,797
Really, what are
you doing here?

375
00:18:55,077 --> 00:18:57,164
I have been having
a tough time,

376
00:18:57,264 --> 00:18:58,617
you know, back in LA.

377
00:18:58,717 --> 00:19:01,617
But then I came here,
and here you are.

378
00:19:01,717 --> 00:19:03,897
I just think that's
too crazy to be...

379
00:19:03,997 --> 00:19:06,417
Hello there, you
little sex object.

380
00:19:06,517 --> 00:19:09,097
I've lost a shoe.
Have you seen it anywhere?

381
00:19:09,197 --> 00:19:11,815
It's like this one,
but, you know,

382
00:19:11,915 --> 00:19:14,377
obviously it's
the opposite one.

383
00:19:14,477 --> 00:19:16,715
Excuse me, missus,
I've lost a shoe.

384
00:19:16,815 --> 00:19:19,497
Like this one. It's
like this one's fellow.

385
00:19:19,597 --> 00:19:21,477
- Sort of the exact
opposite, in fact, of that.

386
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:22,577
Uh-huh.

387
00:19:22,677 --> 00:19:24,977
Not an evil version,
but just, you know,

388
00:19:25,077 --> 00:19:27,307
a shoe like this, but
for the other foot.

389
00:19:27,407 --> 00:19:29,137
Otherwise, I'd
have two right...

390
00:19:29,237 --> 00:19:30,617
Aldous, this is Peter.

391
00:19:30,717 --> 00:19:32,537
Hey, all right, Peter.

392
00:19:32,637 --> 00:19:35,272
Nice to meet you,
mate. Aldous.

393
00:19:35,557 --> 00:19:37,697
- Good to meet you, man.
- My ex-boyfriend.

394
00:19:37,797 --> 00:19:39,857
Right. Hey, I'm Aldous Snow.

395
00:19:39,957 --> 00:19:40,781
I know who you are.

396
00:19:40,881 --> 00:19:42,257
Yeah, you're
very, very famous.

397
00:19:42,357 --> 00:19:44,257
Yeah, I am. I am for my sins.

398
00:19:44,357 --> 00:19:46,697
So are you staying
here, as well?

399
00:19:46,797 --> 00:19:47,745
- I'm not, as a
matter of fact...

400
00:19:47,845 --> 00:19:48,097
I'm sorry.

401
00:19:48,197 --> 00:19:50,617
Excuse me, Mr
Bretter, Ms Marshall,

402
00:19:50,717 --> 00:19:53,047
but we were able to book the

403
00:19:53,147 --> 00:19:56,717
Kapua suite for you,
sir, for four nights.

404
00:19:57,358 --> 00:19:59,358
- You were?
- Yes, sir.

405
00:20:01,198 --> 00:20:01,697
- Marvellous.

406
00:20:01,797 --> 00:20:03,098
Perfect. Perfect
amount of time.

407
00:20:03,198 --> 00:20:04,722
Listen, if you wanna
have dinner with us...

408
00:20:04,822 --> 00:20:05,578
one of those nights...

409
00:20:05,678 --> 00:20:07,018
- Aldous.
...feel very...

410
00:20:07,118 --> 00:20:08,098
No.

411
00:20:08,198 --> 00:20:09,293
That's very
gentlemanly of you,

412
00:20:09,393 --> 00:20:10,378
but you two enjoy your trip.

413
00:20:10,478 --> 00:20:12,458
I'll be just fine on my own.

414
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:15,298
- All right, Peter.
- The Kapua suite...

415
00:20:15,398 --> 00:20:16,763
- Have a good trip, Pete.

416
00:20:16,863 --> 00:20:18,738
I like your shirt.
It's colourful.

417
00:20:18,838 --> 00:20:20,458
- Bye.
- Bye now.

418
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:24,808
Ta-ta. I was wearing two shoes
this morning, right?

419
00:20:28,198 --> 00:20:30,539
Thank you. Thank you
for bailing me out.

420
00:20:30,639 --> 00:20:32,442
I still can't
afford that room.

421
00:20:32,542 --> 00:20:32,928
Nobody can.

422
00:20:33,028 --> 00:20:34,722
It's for, like, Oprah
or, like, Céline Dion.

423
00:20:34,822 --> 00:20:36,042
Really, it's not a big deal.

424
00:20:36,142 --> 00:20:37,095
So you can stay in the suite,

425
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:38,562
but since you're not
technically a guest,

426
00:20:38,662 --> 00:20:40,762
you have to clean
up after yourself.

427
00:20:40,862 --> 00:20:43,837
Otherwise, here is
your room key...

428
00:20:44,342 --> 00:20:46,342
and enjoy your stay.

429
00:20:47,102 --> 00:20:49,652
Why are you doing this for me?

430
00:20:51,022 --> 00:20:53,133
She's here with
some guy already?

431
00:20:53,233 --> 00:20:54,362
Kind of messed up.

432
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:56,462
- Right?
- Yeah.

433
00:20:57,222 --> 00:20:58,882
- Thank you.
- Really, it's not a big deal.

434
00:20:58,982 --> 00:21:00,282
Go enjoy yourself.

435
00:21:00,382 --> 00:21:03,162
Rachel Jansen.
A thousand times, thank you,

436
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,522
- you know what I mean...
- Go enjoy yourself.

437
00:21:05,622 --> 00:21:08,682
- This is a disaster.
Calm down, man.

438
00:21:08,702 --> 00:21:09,922
Are there other
hotels on the island?

439
00:21:10,022 --> 00:21:11,322
Of course there
are other hotels,

440
00:21:11,422 --> 00:21:12,191
but I'm not leaving here,

441
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:13,322
it'll look like
I'm running away.

442
00:21:13,422 --> 00:21:14,813
Wait. Why are you whispering?

443
00:21:14,913 --> 00:21:16,602
You're not following
them, are you?

444
00:21:16,702 --> 00:21:17,802
I had a girlfriend, right?

445
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:19,407
And Liam and Noel Gallagher...

446
00:21:19,507 --> 00:21:21,842
both had it off with her
right in front of me,

447
00:21:21,942 --> 00:21:23,242
so that's similar.

448
00:21:23,342 --> 00:21:24,762
And that was a bit
awkward, actually.

449
00:21:24,862 --> 00:21:26,602
So if you do wanna
change hotels.

450
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:27,682
I quite understand.

451
00:21:27,782 --> 00:21:30,202
No, no, I'm not
changing hotels.

452
00:21:30,302 --> 00:21:30,926
Stop following...

453
00:21:31,026 --> 00:21:32,442
and just go back to
your room, Peter.

454
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:33,167
- They're gone.

455
00:21:33,267 --> 00:21:34,522
Why are you looking for them?

456
00:21:34,622 --> 00:21:36,402
- I don't know.
- You're acting like an idiot.

457
00:21:36,502 --> 00:21:38,362
Run. Get out of there.
Go to your room.

458
00:21:38,462 --> 00:21:39,942
- What do you think
they're doing?

459
00:21:40,042 --> 00:21:40,442
Peter, go.

460
00:21:40,542 --> 00:21:42,362
Oh, God. Okay, there they are.

461
00:21:42,462 --> 00:21:44,082
- There they are, I see them.
- Go back to your room, Peter.

462
00:21:44,182 --> 00:21:45,722
Peter, go back to your room.
Go back to your room, Peter.

463
00:21:45,822 --> 00:21:46,842
I'm going in.

464
00:21:46,942 --> 00:21:48,562
Go back to your room, Peter.
Are you listening to me?

465
00:21:48,662 --> 00:21:50,922
Peter, go back to your room.
Peter, Peter, Peter...

466
00:21:51,022 --> 00:21:53,022
Hey.

467
00:21:53,262 --> 00:21:55,262
Hey, nice room.

468
00:21:55,302 --> 00:21:57,302
Go.

469
00:21:57,342 --> 00:21:59,202
I am in the Kapua suite.

470
00:21:59,302 --> 00:22:02,055
What are you doing? Sucker.

471
00:22:02,182 --> 00:22:04,182
Have fun.

472
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:06,992
Listen, you piece of shit.

473
00:22:07,262 --> 00:22:10,782
You're an idiot. Back
to your room, Peter.

474
00:22:10,882 --> 00:22:13,007
Peter, back to your room.

475
00:22:13,262 --> 00:22:14,562
Did you enjoy that?

476
00:22:14,662 --> 00:22:17,122
- Did you like what you saw?
- That hurt a lot.

477
00:22:17,222 --> 00:22:18,617
But I know Sarah,

478
00:22:18,717 --> 00:22:22,287
and I'm pretty sure I
just ruined her day.

479
00:22:35,182 --> 00:22:35,533
You know...

480
00:22:35,633 --> 00:22:37,042
how we thought the
killer masturbated...

481
00:22:37,142 --> 00:22:39,202
before he committed
each homicide?

482
00:22:39,302 --> 00:22:40,962
That's the theory.

483
00:22:41,062 --> 00:22:43,612
Take a look at the microscope.

484
00:22:45,382 --> 00:22:48,612
Oh, yeah, looks like
where he's going,

485
00:22:49,342 --> 00:22:52,487
he'll need to know
how to masturbate.

486
00:23:03,622 --> 00:23:05,622
Oh, God.

487
00:23:09,062 --> 00:23:11,062
- Hello.
Hey, Peter?

488
00:23:12,102 --> 00:23:14,102
- Sarah?
- No.

489
00:23:14,182 --> 00:23:17,582
It's Rachel Jansen,
from the front desk.

490
00:23:19,382 --> 00:23:20,382
- Hey.

491
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:22,082
Hey, what's going on up there?

492
00:23:22,182 --> 00:23:23,446
I'm getting complaints...

493
00:23:23,546 --> 00:23:25,282
about a woman crying
hysterically.

494
00:23:25,382 --> 00:23:28,202
Yeah, you know what,
I hear her, too,

495
00:23:28,302 --> 00:23:31,442
and it sounds like
she's having such a hard time.

496
00:23:31,542 --> 00:23:34,162
I think it's coming from
the floor above me.

497
00:23:34,262 --> 00:23:36,302
You're on the top floor.

498
00:23:38,022 --> 00:23:40,147
I'll try to keep it down.

499
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:42,842
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, you have a nice night.

500
00:23:42,942 --> 00:23:44,942
Okay.

501
00:23:58,102 --> 00:24:00,262
I would love to sell
you some weed, Jeremy,

502
00:24:00,362 --> 00:24:02,162
but I'm at my fucking
job right now.

503
00:24:02,262 --> 00:24:04,319
Obviously, because
you called me at work,

504
00:24:04,419 --> 00:24:06,322
you know that I'm at
my place of work.

505
00:24:06,422 --> 00:24:08,282
So I can't just leave here
and sell you some weed.

506
00:24:08,382 --> 00:24:10,642
I can sell you some
weed when I'm done.

507
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:12,731
Hold on, I gotta
call you back.

508
00:24:12,831 --> 00:24:14,162
Mahalo, all right....

509
00:24:14,262 --> 00:24:16,442
- Hey, how's it going?
- Hey.

510
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:18,162
I'd just like to grab
some dinner, please.

511
00:24:18,262 --> 00:24:20,822
- Okay, great. Is your
wife gonna meet you?

512
00:24:20,922 --> 00:24:21,922
No.

513
00:24:22,022 --> 00:24:24,022
Your girlfriend?

514
00:24:24,742 --> 00:24:27,292
No, I don't have a girlfriend.

515
00:24:28,742 --> 00:24:31,547
- You're just by yourself?
- Yeah.

516
00:24:31,782 --> 00:24:33,042
Sucks.

517
00:24:33,142 --> 00:24:35,216
Okay, so just one.
Here's your wine list...

518
00:24:35,316 --> 00:24:36,402
and your menu. Come on.

519
00:24:36,502 --> 00:24:37,882
Do you want, like, a magazine
or something?

520
00:24:37,982 --> 00:24:38,765
It's gonna be boring...

521
00:24:38,865 --> 00:24:40,082
if you're just
sitting by yourself.

522
00:24:40,182 --> 00:24:41,322
I'll be all right. Thank you.

523
00:24:41,422 --> 00:24:43,602
I just would be so depressed.

524
00:24:43,702 --> 00:24:45,002
- Yeah.
- Here you go.

525
00:24:45,102 --> 00:24:46,922
Thank you.

526
00:24:47,022 --> 00:24:48,022
The best thing is,

527
00:24:48,122 --> 00:24:50,442
you have the greatest
table in the house.

528
00:24:50,542 --> 00:24:51,032
- Oh, yeah?

529
00:24:51,132 --> 00:24:52,602
That's Aldous
Snow right there.

530
00:24:52,702 --> 00:24:54,922
I know. I know, dude. I know.

531
00:24:55,022 --> 00:24:56,882
- I'm gonna ask him.
I'll ask him politely.

532
00:24:56,982 --> 00:24:58,042
No, please don't, please.

533
00:24:58,142 --> 00:25:00,142
Mate.

534
00:25:00,262 --> 00:25:01,622
Why don't you come
over and sit with us?

535
00:25:01,722 --> 00:25:02,482
You'll be very welcome.

536
00:25:02,582 --> 00:25:05,654
No, thank you. I need a drink.

537
00:25:06,822 --> 00:25:08,882
Would you guys like a drink?

538
00:25:08,982 --> 00:25:11,362
Well, no, actually, because...

539
00:25:11,462 --> 00:25:12,658
Seven years clean.

540
00:25:12,758 --> 00:25:14,922
That's what this
tattoo denotes.

541
00:25:15,022 --> 00:25:17,282
Seven years free from
drugs and alcohol.

542
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:19,522
If I have just
one sip of wine,

543
00:25:19,622 --> 00:25:20,886
by the end of the evening,

544
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:23,362
I'll be, like, rimming
waiters for their tips...

545
00:25:23,462 --> 00:25:24,602
just to get me
hands on a rock.

546
00:25:24,702 --> 00:25:27,082
You know what I mean? Nasty.

547
00:25:27,782 --> 00:25:30,757
I heard that.
- Hey, what's up, man?

548
00:25:30,822 --> 00:25:32,522
How are you enjoying
your vegetable medley?

549
00:25:32,622 --> 00:25:34,622
It's mundane.

550
00:25:34,622 --> 00:25:36,962
It is mundane. It's
great, I know.

551
00:25:37,062 --> 00:25:38,882
Will you marry me?

552
00:25:38,982 --> 00:25:40,922
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Yes.

553
00:25:41,022 --> 00:25:43,317
- She said yes.
- Beautiful.

554
00:25:43,342 --> 00:25:45,342
Congratulations.

555
00:25:47,622 --> 00:25:50,937
I'm so excited. Oh,
my God. Oh, my God.

556
00:25:51,382 --> 00:25:53,382
Peter.

557
00:25:55,062 --> 00:25:56,922
What's up?

558
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:58,962
- Are you doing okay?
- Yeah.

559
00:25:59,062 --> 00:26:01,062
Yeah, I'm good.

560
00:26:01,702 --> 00:26:03,230
Look, did you follow me here?

561
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:05,402
Did my assistant tell
you I was coming?

562
00:26:05,502 --> 00:26:06,842
- No.
- Did you talk to her?

563
00:26:06,942 --> 00:26:08,989
No, I didn't talk
to your assistant.

564
00:26:09,089 --> 00:26:10,962
It's not all about
you, you know.

565
00:26:11,062 --> 00:26:12,840
Hawaii is a beautiful place.

566
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,762
People come here, usually
not to follow you.

567
00:26:15,862 --> 00:26:18,482
So you're really staying?
You're gonna stay?

568
00:26:18,582 --> 00:26:21,079
Yeah, I think so. I
really like it here.

569
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:22,402
I feel at home here.

570
00:26:22,502 --> 00:26:24,502
I just love it.

571
00:26:25,142 --> 00:26:26,602
Yeah, you should stay.

572
00:26:26,702 --> 00:26:29,122
I appreciate your
consideration.

573
00:26:29,222 --> 00:26:31,722
Sounds like Aldous probably
shared a lot of needles,

574
00:26:31,822 --> 00:26:34,162
so thank you for
dating him after me.

575
00:26:34,262 --> 00:26:36,472
- I appreciate that.
- Hmm.

576
00:26:37,142 --> 00:26:39,585
- Hope you have a
really good time here.

577
00:26:39,685 --> 00:26:40,882
Have a great dinner.

578
00:26:40,982 --> 00:26:42,982
Thank you.

579
00:26:43,382 --> 00:26:45,202
Groupie whore.

580
00:26:45,302 --> 00:26:47,162
Psycho stalker.

581
00:26:47,262 --> 00:26:49,677
You know what? It's vacation.

582
00:26:49,777 --> 00:26:53,602
I think I'll just take
a piña colada, please.

583
00:26:59,422 --> 00:27:01,122
Look at this guy.

584
00:27:01,222 --> 00:27:03,690
Look at this guy.

585
00:27:05,542 --> 00:27:08,340
Not us, buddy. Right? Not us.

586
00:27:08,462 --> 00:27:12,137
I'm on Sex and the City.
What's up, Miranda?

587
00:27:13,102 --> 00:27:16,981
I'm Samantha. I have
sex with everyone.

588
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:19,002
Maybe it's a good thing
that they're here.

589
00:27:19,102 --> 00:27:20,059
You know what I mean?

590
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:21,882
Maybe this is a
challenge from God...

591
00:27:21,982 --> 00:27:23,962
for me to forget
her. You know?

592
00:27:24,062 --> 00:27:28,907
Or maybe it's a sign from God
that you should be with her.

593
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:31,022
I love her show.

594
00:27:31,102 --> 00:27:34,282
When they mix the sexuality
and the violence, I like it.

595
00:27:34,382 --> 00:27:35,812
What the hell is
wrong with you two?

596
00:27:35,912 --> 00:27:36,602
You gotta move on.

597
00:27:36,702 --> 00:27:38,802
I hear you say that,
but it's not that easy.

598
00:27:38,902 --> 00:27:41,002
It's that easy.
Promise you it is.

599
00:27:41,102 --> 00:27:42,762
I lived in South Central.

600
00:27:42,862 --> 00:27:45,501
South Central. And I hated it.

601
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:46,842
That's why I moved to Oahu.

602
00:27:46,942 --> 00:27:47,724
Now I can name you...

603
00:27:47,824 --> 00:27:49,082
over 200 different
kinds of fish.

604
00:27:49,182 --> 00:27:50,762
- No, you can't.
- Oh, yes, I can.

605
00:27:50,862 --> 00:27:52,202
- Do it.
- Yeah, you cannot.

606
00:27:52,302 --> 00:27:55,332
G. Ghost pipefish, grill
fish, goaler fish...

607
00:27:55,432 --> 00:27:57,162
grouper fish, greenback...

608
00:27:57,262 --> 00:27:58,922
What's the state
fish of Hawaii?

609
00:27:59,022 --> 00:28:00,562
Humuhumunukunukuapua'a.

610
00:28:00,662 --> 00:28:02,662
- Yeah, bitch.
- Hey.

611
00:28:03,022 --> 00:28:06,422
- You ready?
- Yeah, just gonna close up.

612
00:28:08,302 --> 00:28:12,362
Hello, Mr Bretter, Mr Brayden.
Where's your wife, sir?

613
00:28:12,462 --> 00:28:14,692
She is in bed.

614
00:28:14,822 --> 00:28:16,682
How are things
going with the lady?

615
00:28:16,782 --> 00:28:17,782
Not awesome.

616
00:28:17,882 --> 00:28:21,452
She's complicated, like
The Da Vinci Code,

617
00:28:21,622 --> 00:28:24,341
you know, but harder to crack.

618
00:28:25,582 --> 00:28:27,912
But life is full of lessons.

619
00:28:28,012 --> 00:28:30,875
You learn something
new every day.

620
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:34,375
Wonder what I'm going
to learn tomorrow.

621
00:28:34,942 --> 00:28:36,482
Well.

622
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:37,962
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

623
00:28:38,062 --> 00:28:39,122
Good night, sir.

624
00:28:39,222 --> 00:28:42,112
Off to find the
mythical clitoris.

625
00:28:43,022 --> 00:28:45,827
So, Peter, were
you able to get...

626
00:28:45,835 --> 00:28:48,725
that crying lady
out of your room?

627
00:28:49,262 --> 00:28:50,236
'Cause I could
send someone up,

628
00:28:50,336 --> 00:28:50,682
if you want.

629
00:28:50,782 --> 00:28:52,782
- Oh, you could?
- Yeah.

630
00:28:53,302 --> 00:28:55,896
That's very funny. It is.

631
00:28:57,022 --> 00:28:59,902
Well, listen, Sarah
Marshall Show sucks.

632
00:29:00,002 --> 00:29:01,002
Who cares?

633
00:29:01,102 --> 00:29:03,992
I do the music for
that programme.

634
00:29:04,782 --> 00:29:07,757
Did I mention that
the music rocks?

635
00:29:08,702 --> 00:29:10,187
That's very sweet of you.

636
00:29:10,287 --> 00:29:12,202
That's very sweet
of you to say.

637
00:29:12,302 --> 00:29:13,638
You don't have to
say that, though.

638
00:29:13,738 --> 00:29:14,282
It's not music.

639
00:29:14,382 --> 00:29:16,922
There's no melody,
it's just tones.

640
00:29:17,022 --> 00:29:19,147
Just dark, ominous tones.

641
00:29:20,662 --> 00:29:23,722
'The masturbating dog killer
is on the loose again.

642
00:29:23,822 --> 00:29:25,642
'He'll kill the owner,

643
00:29:25,742 --> 00:29:28,547
but at least the
dogs are happy.'

644
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:36,292
I'm no Aldous Snow,
I guess, you know.

645
00:29:40,302 --> 00:29:42,941
 Time to start the music

646
00:29:43,262 --> 00:29:45,387
All gonna light the light

647
00:29:45,702 --> 00:29:48,821
Yeah, yeah, gonna
get things started...

648
00:29:48,921 --> 00:29:51,386
on The Muppet Show tonight...

649
00:29:56,862 --> 00:30:00,347
- Whipped cream or berry?
- Whipped cream.

650
00:30:01,102 --> 00:30:04,482
Here we are, sir. Have
a wonderful breakfast.

651
00:30:04,582 --> 00:30:06,882
What a lovely table, so
close to the buffet.

652
00:30:06,982 --> 00:30:09,447
I'm glad you like it. Mahalo.

653
00:30:13,142 --> 00:30:14,842
Good morning, sir.
Can I start you with anything?

654
00:30:14,942 --> 00:30:16,082
Orange juice, coffee?

655
00:30:16,182 --> 00:30:17,888
What about, like, some
pineapple juice...

656
00:30:17,988 --> 00:30:19,522
with a little bit
of rum on the side.

657
00:30:19,622 --> 00:30:23,331
Of course. I like your
style. Cocktail guy.

658
00:30:23,462 --> 00:30:25,362
- Thank you.
- You are welcome.

659
00:30:25,462 --> 00:30:27,322
We've already reserved
the sea kayak for noon.

660
00:30:27,422 --> 00:30:28,332
Honey, I know that,

661
00:30:28,432 --> 00:30:30,202
but you know that
I wanted to see...

662
00:30:30,302 --> 00:30:33,658
- Hey. Hello there, friend.
- Hey.

663
00:30:33,782 --> 00:30:36,122
How are you guys?
How was your evening?

664
00:30:36,222 --> 00:30:37,682
- Great.
- Awesome.

665
00:30:37,782 --> 00:30:40,642
- I can't feel anything.
- All right.

666
00:30:40,742 --> 00:30:43,002
- Does that feel good?
- I still can't feel anything.

667
00:30:43,102 --> 00:30:45,227
Okay, 'cause it hurts me.

668
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:48,192
- Would you do that for me?
- Yeah.

669
00:30:48,902 --> 00:30:52,497
- Yeah.
- No, no, no. No.

670
00:30:53,022 --> 00:30:57,017
God put our mouths on our head
for a reason. No.

671
00:30:58,182 --> 00:31:01,157
- I'm going to the bathroom.
- Okay.

672
00:31:01,462 --> 00:31:06,217
- Is everything okay with...
- Waffles.

673
00:31:09,622 --> 00:31:11,702
- Here you go, sir.
Breakfast of champions.

674
00:31:11,802 --> 00:31:12,802
Oh, thank you.

675
00:31:12,902 --> 00:31:17,832
And don't tell anybody, but...
A little extra love for you.

676
00:31:19,022 --> 00:31:20,082
Thank you.

677
00:31:20,182 --> 00:31:22,457
- Take it easy.
- You, too.

678
00:31:34,614 --> 00:31:36,354
- Hi.
- Hi.

679
00:31:36,454 --> 00:31:37,834
This is the yoga place, yeah?

680
00:31:37,934 --> 00:31:40,646
Yes. But there's no
alcohol allowed...

681
00:31:40,746 --> 00:31:41,714
in the studio.

682
00:31:41,814 --> 00:31:46,489
Oh, no, I mean, obviously.
This is just pineapple juice.

683
00:31:46,974 --> 00:31:49,438
Well, there's no
outside drinks...

684
00:31:49,538 --> 00:31:51,114
allowed in the studio.

685
00:31:51,214 --> 00:31:52,554
- Can I set it down?
- Sure.

686
00:31:52,654 --> 00:31:54,834
- Cool, thank you.
- I like your hat.

687
00:31:54,934 --> 00:31:55,953
- Thank you.

688
00:31:56,053 --> 00:31:58,674
Please remove it before class.

689
00:32:00,534 --> 00:32:01,674
Hey, everyone,

690
00:32:01,774 --> 00:32:04,579
why don't you all
grab your mats?

691
00:32:05,414 --> 00:32:07,564
Sorry, I recognise
you from the cover...

692
00:32:07,664 --> 00:32:09,594
of Namaste Magazine.
I'm a huge fan.

693
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:11,874
Thank you. That's so
sweet of you to say.

694
00:32:11,974 --> 00:32:12,980
I appreciate that.

695
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,554
Obviously, I don't do
yoga for recognition.

696
00:32:15,654 --> 00:32:20,754
Right, of course you wouldn't.
Then stop being so good at it.

697
00:32:21,174 --> 00:32:24,064
That's very flexible.
That's nice.

698
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:27,734
- And, you, I recognise
you from your show.

699
00:32:27,834 --> 00:32:28,834
Thank you.

700
00:32:28,934 --> 00:32:31,824
You seem much taller
on your show.

701
00:32:32,054 --> 00:32:34,249
- I'm not.
- No, I know.

702
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:37,691
Okay, if you just wanna start...

703
00:32:37,791 --> 00:32:39,554
by bringing your
palms into your chest.

704
00:32:39,654 --> 00:32:41,248
Today we're gonna start with...

705
00:32:41,348 --> 00:32:43,314
the Surya Namaskar,
or Sun Salutation.

706
00:32:43,414 --> 00:32:45,709
Let's take a deep inale in.

707
00:32:46,014 --> 00:32:48,034
Exhale and release the hands.

708
00:32:48,134 --> 00:32:51,194
Inale, arms up to
the sky. Continue.

709
00:32:51,814 --> 00:32:54,619
Good, exhale and
folding forward.

710
00:32:55,294 --> 00:32:59,253
Strong, strong backs.
Good, excellent.

711
00:32:59,374 --> 00:33:01,154
Remember this is
not a competition,

712
00:33:01,254 --> 00:33:03,554
although you two seem
to be the best in the class.

713
00:33:03,654 --> 00:33:05,994
Excellent. Perfect
form, you two, perfect.

714
00:33:06,094 --> 00:33:09,069
Coming up into
downward-facing dog.

715
00:33:09,294 --> 00:33:11,474
Good. It's really
important in this pose,

716
00:33:11,574 --> 00:33:12,885
that you arch your back...

717
00:33:12,985 --> 00:33:14,714
and keep it flat
at the same time.

718
00:33:14,814 --> 00:33:17,274
I feel like those
are opposing ideas.

719
00:33:17,374 --> 00:33:19,702
No, they're not, 'cause
you're arching...

720
00:33:19,802 --> 00:33:21,434
your back up while it's flat.

721
00:33:21,534 --> 00:33:23,534
Okay.

722
00:33:24,974 --> 00:33:26,490
Good, yeah, sweat it out.

723
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:29,234
Sweat out all the toxins
from this morning.

724
00:33:29,334 --> 00:33:31,394
- Come on, lady.
- My name is Prana,

725
00:33:31,494 --> 00:33:33,754
and I know that
wasn't just juice.

726
00:33:33,854 --> 00:33:36,181
You don't really
need any adjusting,

727
00:33:36,281 --> 00:33:38,674
so I'm just gonna
do this for myself.

728
00:33:38,774 --> 00:33:40,994
Just to learn from your body,

729
00:33:41,094 --> 00:33:43,094
memorize your body.

730
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:46,004
- Good. Strong legs.
- Come on.

731
00:33:46,894 --> 00:33:48,894
Perfect skin and form.

732
00:33:49,734 --> 00:33:52,674
Okay, class, I'd like to now
move into a tripod headstand.

733
00:33:52,774 --> 00:33:54,474
This is more of
an advanced pose,

734
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:56,314
so if you don't
feel comfortable...

735
00:33:56,414 --> 00:33:57,234
or strong enough,

736
00:33:57,334 --> 00:33:59,814
please feel free to
just lay on your mat...

737
00:33:59,914 --> 00:34:00,914
in child's pose.

738
00:34:01,014 --> 00:34:02,274
I got it.

739
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:05,354
All right, so let's all
come down to our mats.

740
00:34:05,454 --> 00:34:08,514
Get in a prep position
for the tripod headstand.

741
00:34:08,614 --> 00:34:09,674
If you don't feel comfortable,

742
00:34:09,774 --> 00:34:10,774
there's no shame...

743
00:34:10,874 --> 00:34:12,794
in just laying on your
mat in child's pose.

744
00:34:12,894 --> 00:34:14,314
Lady, I got it.

745
00:34:14,414 --> 00:34:17,559
Good, so let's prep
to come up. Good.

746
00:34:18,574 --> 00:34:20,559
Sir, if you just
want to lay down...

747
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:21,514
in child's pose.

748
00:34:21,614 --> 00:34:22,594
Now, you all heard me say,

749
00:34:22,694 --> 00:34:24,534
'If you want to be
in child's pose,

750
00:34:24,634 --> 00:34:25,634
that's okay.'

751
00:34:25,734 --> 00:34:27,714
- Just in case he gets hurt.
- Bring it, bring it.

752
00:34:27,814 --> 00:34:29,954
I don't want you to
break your neck.

753
00:34:30,054 --> 00:34:31,554
- What's up?
- Just relax.

754
00:34:31,654 --> 00:34:33,514
My legs, that's what.

755
00:34:33,614 --> 00:34:35,674
We're doing quiet
headstands today.

756
00:34:35,774 --> 00:34:37,474
I'm doing a handstand,
motherfucker.

757
00:34:37,574 --> 00:34:38,594
I'm doing a handstand.

758
00:34:38,694 --> 00:34:40,274
Okay, you know, why
don't we just release.

759
00:34:40,374 --> 00:34:41,874
Thank God.

760
00:34:41,974 --> 00:34:44,408
Good, everybody. Good.

761
00:34:48,534 --> 00:34:49,754
Hey.

762
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:51,274
Are you Chuck?

763
00:34:51,374 --> 00:34:54,834
Oh, man, you know,
they won't change that flyer.

764
00:34:54,934 --> 00:34:58,354
That's my mainland name.
My Hawaiian name is Koonu.

765
00:34:58,454 --> 00:34:59,754
Cool, sorry.

766
00:34:59,854 --> 00:35:01,034
No, it's all good.

767
00:35:01,134 --> 00:35:04,034
Does Koonu have some, like,
cool Hawaiian meaning?

768
00:35:04,134 --> 00:35:05,914
It means Chuck.

769
00:35:06,014 --> 00:35:07,474
I plugged it into a database.

770
00:35:07,574 --> 00:35:08,781
There's a thing you can go on,

771
00:35:08,881 --> 00:35:10,674
on the Internet, you
just type in your name,

772
00:35:10,774 --> 00:35:12,774
and it just says it.

773
00:35:13,772 --> 00:35:14,752
What's your name?

774
00:35:14,852 --> 00:35:16,072
- I'm Peter.
- Peter.

775
00:35:16,172 --> 00:35:16,372
- Yeah.

776
00:35:16,472 --> 00:35:17,672
I'm gonna give you
a Hawaiian name.

777
00:35:17,772 --> 00:35:19,772
Oh, great.

778
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:24,412
Pepiopi.

779
00:35:25,852 --> 00:35:26,125
- Great.

780
00:35:26,225 --> 00:35:28,072
Pepiopi, looks like you've
got a little pain...

781
00:35:28,172 --> 00:35:30,172
behind those eyes.

782
00:35:31,372 --> 00:35:33,372
Yeah, maybe a little.

783
00:35:33,932 --> 00:35:35,912
There's really only
one cure for that.

784
00:35:36,012 --> 00:35:37,032
What's that?

785
00:35:37,132 --> 00:35:39,132
Weed. You got any?

786
00:35:40,932 --> 00:35:43,907
- No.
- Well, then let's go surfing.

787
00:35:46,212 --> 00:35:47,473
Okay, when we're out there,

788
00:35:47,573 --> 00:35:49,272
I want you to ignore
your instincts.

789
00:35:49,372 --> 00:35:52,352
I'm gonna be your instincts.
Koonu will be your instincts.

790
00:35:52,452 --> 00:35:53,832
Don't do anything.

791
00:35:53,932 --> 00:35:56,567
Don't try to
surf, don't do it.

792
00:35:57,052 --> 00:35:59,272
The less you do,
the more you do.

793
00:35:59,372 --> 00:36:02,092
Let's see you pop
up. Pop it up.

794
00:36:05,492 --> 00:36:06,592
That's not it at all.

795
00:36:06,692 --> 00:36:10,177
Do less. Get down.
Try less. Do it again.

796
00:36:10,292 --> 00:36:11,992
Pop up.

797
00:36:12,092 --> 00:36:13,672
No, too slow. Do less.

798
00:36:13,772 --> 00:36:15,352
Pop up.

799
00:36:15,452 --> 00:36:16,512
Pop up.

800
00:36:16,612 --> 00:36:18,792
You're doing too much.
Do less. Pop down.

801
00:36:18,892 --> 00:36:20,072
Pop up now.

802
00:36:20,172 --> 00:36:21,472
Stop. Get down.
Get down there.

803
00:36:21,572 --> 00:36:23,952
Remember, don't do anything.

804
00:36:24,252 --> 00:36:26,252
Nothing. Pop up.

805
00:36:28,372 --> 00:36:29,912
Well, you... No, you
gotta do more than that,

806
00:36:30,012 --> 00:36:31,112
'cause you're just
laying right out.

807
00:36:31,212 --> 00:36:32,192
It looks like you're
boogie-boarding.

808
00:36:32,292 --> 00:36:34,672
Just do it. Feel it. Pop up.

809
00:36:35,852 --> 00:36:36,938
Yeah. That wasn't quite it,

810
00:36:37,038 --> 00:36:38,712
but we're gonna figure
it out, out there.

811
00:36:38,812 --> 00:36:39,832
Let's go surfing, come on.

812
00:36:39,932 --> 00:36:41,832
Everybody's learning
how, come on and...

813
00:36:41,932 --> 00:36:44,482
The weather outside is weather

814
00:36:45,692 --> 00:36:47,712
How long you lived out here?

815
00:36:47,812 --> 00:36:49,615
Man, I don't know. I
quit wearing a watch...

816
00:36:49,715 --> 00:36:50,592
when I moved out here.

817
00:36:50,692 --> 00:36:52,992
- Wow, that's so cool.
- Yeah.

818
00:36:53,092 --> 00:36:55,453
No, like my cell phone
has a clock on it,

819
00:36:55,553 --> 00:36:57,032
so I don't really need it.

820
00:36:57,132 --> 00:37:00,152
Right, so it's basically
the same thing.

821
00:37:00,252 --> 00:37:01,252
- How old are you?

822
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:03,392
I don't really believe
in age or numbers,

823
00:37:03,492 --> 00:37:04,327
you know, I don't...

824
00:37:04,427 --> 00:37:06,192
I mean, if you had to
put a number on it.

825
00:37:06,292 --> 00:37:08,601
I guess I'd be 44.

826
00:37:10,852 --> 00:37:12,632
Fuck.

827
00:37:12,732 --> 00:37:15,282
Thanks for taking me out here.

828
00:37:16,012 --> 00:37:17,837
This is the first time
I've felt good...

829
00:37:17,937 --> 00:37:18,872
in three weeks or so.

830
00:37:18,972 --> 00:37:20,488
You need to get back
on that board...

831
00:37:20,588 --> 00:37:21,512
is what you need to do.

832
00:37:21,612 --> 00:37:23,392
- Yeah?
- Hey, here's the deal.

833
00:37:23,492 --> 00:37:24,872
When life gives you lemons,

834
00:37:24,972 --> 00:37:27,112
just say, 'Fuck the
lemons,' and bail.

835
00:37:27,212 --> 00:37:29,820
Yeah. No. You
said it, totally.

836
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,197
You gotta just pull
yourself up...

837
00:37:31,297 --> 00:37:31,872
by your wetsuit,

838
00:37:31,972 --> 00:37:32,952
get back on that board...

839
00:37:33,052 --> 00:37:34,552
Hey, look, man,
if you're attacked by a shark,

840
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:36,072
are you gonna give up surfing?

841
00:37:36,172 --> 00:37:37,792
Probably, yeah.

842
00:37:37,892 --> 00:37:41,207
Let's go in, all right.
Tacos are on me.

843
00:37:41,212 --> 00:37:42,114
Can you try to listen...

844
00:37:42,214 --> 00:37:43,472
to what I'm saying
to you, Brian?

845
00:37:43,572 --> 00:37:45,992
I'm confused and I
don't know what to do.

846
00:37:46,092 --> 00:37:47,352
What's up with that hat?

847
00:37:47,452 --> 00:37:48,230
What are you...

848
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:49,992
in the Buena
Vista Social Club?

849
00:37:50,092 --> 00:37:51,232
This is a nice hat.

850
00:37:51,332 --> 00:37:53,952
What member of the
Brat Pack are you?

851
00:37:54,052 --> 00:37:55,650
You look like one
of those guys...

852
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:56,912
suspected of killing JFK.

853
00:37:57,012 --> 00:37:59,192
That's very funny.
That's great.

854
00:37:59,292 --> 00:38:01,417
Tell him to make friends.

855
00:38:01,492 --> 00:38:03,752
You need to get out there
and make some friends, man.

856
00:38:03,852 --> 00:38:05,352
Is Liz there right now?

857
00:38:05,452 --> 00:38:07,512
No, no, she's not
in here, buddy.

858
00:38:07,612 --> 00:38:08,672
I just heard her.

859
00:38:08,772 --> 00:38:10,552
She's gone.

860
00:38:10,652 --> 00:38:12,652
Who are you looking at?

861
00:38:12,732 --> 00:38:13,712
What?

862
00:38:13,812 --> 00:38:15,432
Is she still... Hi, Liz.

863
00:38:15,532 --> 00:38:18,170
No. I swear on my
mother's grave, it...

864
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:19,392
Okay, it was Liz.

865
00:38:19,492 --> 00:38:21,432
She wasn't here
the entire time.

866
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:22,328
Go out and meet people.

867
00:38:22,428 --> 00:38:23,592
We meet people
all the time......

868
00:38:23,692 --> 00:38:25,112
- All the time on vacation.
- Constantly.

869
00:38:25,212 --> 00:38:26,349
I've tried, all right,

870
00:38:26,449 --> 00:38:28,072
there's a couple
of dudes here,

871
00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:30,382
but they're kind of weird.

872
00:38:30,532 --> 00:38:32,312
Just be friendly.

873
00:38:32,412 --> 00:38:33,512
Iron your shirt.

874
00:38:33,612 --> 00:38:34,952
Iron your shirt, look sharp.

875
00:38:35,052 --> 00:38:37,052
Even your T-shirts.

876
00:38:37,132 --> 00:38:39,052
There is this girl
at the front desk...

877
00:38:39,152 --> 00:38:40,152
who's pretty cute.

878
00:38:40,252 --> 00:38:41,278
Oh, yeah. You know what?

879
00:38:41,378 --> 00:38:43,032
Go have another dirty
one night stand.

880
00:38:43,132 --> 00:38:44,832
That worked out
so well before.

881
00:38:44,932 --> 00:38:45,968
What do you want from me?

882
00:38:46,068 --> 00:38:47,712
You just told me I
need to meet people.

883
00:38:47,812 --> 00:38:48,310
Ask her out.

884
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:50,232
Maybe that's what he
needs, is a rebound.

885
00:38:50,332 --> 00:38:52,152
He's had plenty of chances
for rebounds. This isn't...

886
00:38:52,252 --> 00:38:53,352
Can we get on the
same team here?

887
00:38:53,452 --> 00:38:57,362
Okay, I'm sorry.
We're on the same team. Sorry.

888
00:38:57,612 --> 00:38:59,272
You should go on a
date with this girl.

889
00:38:59,372 --> 00:39:00,672
Well, maybe I'll
ask her out then.

890
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:02,872
- Yes.
- My wife says so....

891
00:39:02,972 --> 00:39:05,952
- Hey, I'm in Hawaii, too.
Oh, that's neat.

892
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:08,052
Aloha, bitches.

893
00:39:08,772 --> 00:39:10,772
That's very cool.

894
00:39:13,412 --> 00:39:16,472
They're not Native
Americans, Brian.

895
00:39:18,092 --> 00:39:19,272
- Bri...
- What are you doing?

896
00:39:19,372 --> 00:39:21,512
- The luha. Is that right?
- Oh, yeah.

897
00:39:21,612 --> 00:39:22,752
It's called the hula....

898
00:39:22,852 --> 00:39:24,552
- Luau?
- No, hula.

899
00:39:24,652 --> 00:39:26,652
You're doing a luau?

900
00:39:39,612 --> 00:39:40,592
- Hey.
- Hey.

901
00:39:40,692 --> 00:39:42,692
- Peter.
- Wow.

902
00:39:43,332 --> 00:39:44,356
You look beautiful.

903
00:39:44,456 --> 00:39:46,272
I mean, that's a
beautiful dress.

904
00:39:46,372 --> 00:39:47,352
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

905
00:39:47,452 --> 00:39:48,752
This'll be fun.

906
00:39:48,852 --> 00:39:50,852
Lei?

907
00:39:54,452 --> 00:39:57,312
May I help you with
something else, Peter?

908
00:39:57,412 --> 00:39:59,312
No, I'll just grab a drink.
I'm just gonna head inside.

909
00:39:59,412 --> 00:40:02,132
- Happy 4th of July.
- Thank you.

910
00:40:03,972 --> 00:40:05,972
Aloha.

911
00:40:18,172 --> 00:40:18,783
- You done here?

912
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:20,072
No, actually, I just sat down.

913
00:40:20,172 --> 00:40:20,876
I'm just getting started.

914
00:40:20,976 --> 00:40:21,952
It's delicious,
though, thank you.

915
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:23,992
I'll just go fuck myself.

916
00:40:24,092 --> 00:40:26,092
- Sorry, what?
- Mahalo.

917
00:40:28,652 --> 00:40:30,652
Hi, Peter.

918
00:40:31,652 --> 00:40:33,652
Hey. Hey, bro.

919
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:36,552
- Hi.
- Hey, all right.

920
00:40:36,652 --> 00:40:38,432
Excuse me. Excuse me.

921
00:40:38,532 --> 00:40:40,357
Everybody, can I have
your attention...

922
00:40:40,457 --> 00:40:41,512
for one second, please.

923
00:40:41,612 --> 00:40:44,392
We have a very special guest
with us here, today.

924
00:40:44,492 --> 00:40:48,572
He is the lead singer
of the band, Infant Sorrow,

925
00:40:49,252 --> 00:40:52,345
one of my favourite
musicians of all time.

926
00:40:52,445 --> 00:40:53,592
He's so awesome.

927
00:40:53,692 --> 00:40:56,157
Please, please, let's take...

928
00:40:56,292 --> 00:40:58,815
Let's see if we can
get him up here.

929
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:01,152
Mr Aldous Snow.
Please, come on.

930
00:41:01,252 --> 00:41:02,312
Share your gift.

931
00:41:02,412 --> 00:41:03,632
Duty calls and all that.

932
00:41:03,732 --> 00:41:05,540
I'm trying to be
incognito, it's weird.

933
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,352
It's like work to
me, this is no fun.

934
00:41:07,452 --> 00:41:09,452
Hey. Thank you.

935
00:41:17,372 --> 00:41:19,752
Thank you.
What a lovely introduction.

936
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:22,192
What an eccentric and
confident young man.

937
00:41:22,292 --> 00:41:23,691
I'd like to dedicate this song...

938
00:41:23,791 --> 00:41:25,672
to a very beautiful
woman that's here today.

939
00:41:25,772 --> 00:41:29,087
It's Miss Sarah
Marshall, there she is.

940
00:41:29,292 --> 00:41:31,292
Look at her, blimey.

941
00:41:38,494 --> 00:41:40,769
Old as ancient skies

942
00:41:41,054 --> 00:41:43,774
I've had these
wandering eyes...

943
00:41:44,414 --> 00:41:46,634
but you took me by surprise...

944
00:41:46,734 --> 00:41:49,009
when you let me inside you

945
00:41:50,894 --> 00:41:52,894
Inside you

946
00:41:53,214 --> 00:41:55,214
Inside you

947
00:41:55,454 --> 00:41:56,874
This went from
6:00 to midnight.

948
00:41:56,974 --> 00:42:01,224
Teach me how to grow
while I'm moving inside of you

949
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:04,854
Inside of you...

950
00:42:05,494 --> 00:42:07,724
- Inside you
- Inside you

951
00:42:08,894 --> 00:42:11,699
I long to be, is
it wrong to be...

952
00:42:11,734 --> 00:42:13,850
inside of you

953
00:42:14,774 --> 00:42:18,767
Inside of you the restless
find their dreams

954
00:42:20,814 --> 00:42:24,523
Inside of you this king
has found his queen

955
00:42:30,934 --> 00:42:31,914
Hey.

956
00:42:32,014 --> 00:42:33,154
You're from the
breakfast buffet, right?

957
00:42:33,254 --> 00:42:34,234
- Yeah.
- Whipped cream or berries?

958
00:42:34,334 --> 00:42:36,334
Yeah. Yeah, I'm Peter.

959
00:42:37,313 --> 00:42:38,133
- Kemo.
- Kemo.

960
00:42:38,233 --> 00:42:40,373
- Good to meet you, man.
- Good to meet, you, man.

961
00:42:40,473 --> 00:42:43,363
- Have a beer.
- Thanks. Thank you.

962
00:42:45,113 --> 00:42:46,493
Sarah Marshall.

963
00:42:46,593 --> 00:42:48,593
Yes.

964
00:42:49,153 --> 00:42:51,133
How do you know
I was dating Sarah Marshall?

965
00:42:51,233 --> 00:42:53,783
Dwayne told me. Chuck told me.

966
00:42:54,353 --> 00:42:55,573
Even Rachel told me.

967
00:42:55,673 --> 00:42:57,693
I heard about it
from everybody.

968
00:42:57,793 --> 00:42:59,813
You gotta stop
talking about it.

969
00:42:59,913 --> 00:43:01,949
It's like The Sopranos.

970
00:43:02,073 --> 00:43:03,773
It's over.

971
00:43:03,873 --> 00:43:05,873
Find a new show.

972
00:43:07,033 --> 00:43:08,653
You need a hug.

973
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:10,753
Come here.

974
00:43:11,873 --> 00:43:13,333
Oh, thank you.

975
00:43:13,433 --> 00:43:15,433
You're awfully nice.

976
00:43:16,313 --> 00:43:17,313
I gotta go.

977
00:43:17,413 --> 00:43:18,893
I'm prepping the pig
for tomorrow's luau.

978
00:43:18,993 --> 00:43:20,125
You should come and help me.

979
00:43:20,225 --> 00:43:21,653
It'll take your
mind off of things.

980
00:43:21,753 --> 00:43:23,973
- Yeah? You don't mind?
- No.

981
00:43:24,073 --> 00:43:27,013
I mean, I must say I'm
a pretty good cook.

982
00:43:27,113 --> 00:43:29,113
All right.

983
00:43:31,433 --> 00:43:34,053
I can't. Please don't
make me do this.

984
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:35,213
Do it.

985
00:43:35,313 --> 00:43:37,668
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

986
00:43:42,313 --> 00:43:43,853
You can stop crying now.

987
00:43:43,953 --> 00:43:45,953
He's dead already.

988
00:43:46,033 --> 00:43:47,413
I'm not crying.

989
00:43:47,513 --> 00:43:48,773
You should stop crying.

990
00:43:48,873 --> 00:43:50,373
I don't cry. I'm not a baby.

991
00:43:50,473 --> 00:43:51,473
Really?

992
00:43:51,573 --> 00:43:53,453
'Cause you look like
a gigantic baby.

993
00:43:53,553 --> 00:43:56,698
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean that at all.

994
00:44:05,433 --> 00:44:06,653
Hey.

995
00:44:06,753 --> 00:44:08,951
Listen, would you like
to hang out tonight,

996
00:44:09,051 --> 00:44:11,093
like, not in an official
hotel function?

997
00:44:11,193 --> 00:44:12,453
Yeah. Totally.

998
00:44:12,553 --> 00:44:13,766
A bunch of us are
going to go to this,

999
00:44:13,866 --> 00:44:15,013
like, little beach
thing afterwards.

1000
00:44:15,113 --> 00:44:17,741
You're totally
welcome to come.

1001
00:44:17,841 --> 00:44:19,453
Maybe we could go together?

1002
00:44:19,553 --> 00:44:21,333
Yeah, whatever.

1003
00:44:21,433 --> 00:44:22,653
I mean we don't have to,
if you don't want to.

1004
00:44:22,753 --> 00:44:23,733
I just thought that maybe...

1005
00:44:23,833 --> 00:44:24,120
No, listen,

1006
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:25,213
you don't have to
make this weird.

1007
00:44:25,313 --> 00:44:28,288
You either want to
go or you don't.

1008
00:44:28,513 --> 00:44:30,638
- I would love to.
- Okay.

1009
00:44:30,673 --> 00:44:32,327
Awesome. Why don't
you go upstairs,

1010
00:44:32,427 --> 00:44:33,253
change that shirt,

1011
00:44:33,353 --> 00:44:37,008
and I'll meet you out
front in, like, five?

1012
00:44:45,713 --> 00:44:48,705
- This is so cool.
- You like it?

1013
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:03,623
So what brought you to Hawaii?

1014
00:45:04,633 --> 00:45:06,783
- A dude.
- Of course.

1015
00:45:06,913 --> 00:45:10,058
A surfer dude. You
know, WCT, top 44.

1016
00:45:13,153 --> 00:45:15,153
Totally.

1017
00:45:16,033 --> 00:45:18,583
We were together
for two years.

1018
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:21,213
Dropped out of school,
moved out here with him.

1019
00:45:21,313 --> 00:45:23,373
Three weeks later,
I caught him cheating on me,

1020
00:45:23,473 --> 00:45:26,193
so I moved out,
and that's that.

1021
00:45:26,673 --> 00:45:28,673
What an asshole.

1022
00:45:29,073 --> 00:45:31,073
No, he's just a boy.

1023
00:45:33,033 --> 00:45:35,955
You ever think about
going back home,

1024
00:45:36,055 --> 00:45:37,853
finishing school, or...

1025
00:45:37,953 --> 00:45:39,573
No.

1026
00:45:39,673 --> 00:45:41,713
No. I work at the hotel,

1027
00:45:42,553 --> 00:45:46,293
doesn't really have to
be a future in there.

1028
00:45:46,473 --> 00:45:48,213
Okay, my turn.

1029
00:45:48,313 --> 00:45:50,093
Okay.

1030
00:45:50,193 --> 00:45:54,266
So, how do you like
writing music for a TV show?

1031
00:45:57,073 --> 00:45:59,333
It's great, you know.
People are great.

1032
00:45:59,433 --> 00:46:01,190
It's great to have
a steady paycheque.

1033
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:02,333
It's... I'm very lucky.

1034
00:46:02,433 --> 00:46:03,453
Oh, my God, you hate it.

1035
00:46:03,553 --> 00:46:05,763
I fucking hate it so much.

1036
00:46:05,993 --> 00:46:08,628
So then, do
something about it.

1037
00:46:11,753 --> 00:46:12,773
Excuse me.

1038
00:46:12,873 --> 00:46:14,833
I'm just saying, if
you hate something,

1039
00:46:14,933 --> 00:46:15,933
change it.

1040
00:46:16,033 --> 00:46:18,838
- Don't dwell.
- Well, I'm trying.

1041
00:46:19,633 --> 00:46:22,778
I'm actually working
on a rock opera.

1042
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:25,113
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1043
00:46:25,793 --> 00:46:28,258
What's your rock opera about?

1044
00:46:30,313 --> 00:46:32,313
Dracula.

1045
00:46:32,913 --> 00:46:34,645
Yeah, and eternal
love, you know.

1046
00:46:34,745 --> 00:46:35,613
That's the theme.

1047
00:46:35,713 --> 00:46:38,273
But I think the two sort
of go hand in hand,

1048
00:46:38,373 --> 00:46:39,373
you know?

1049
00:46:39,473 --> 00:46:41,473
And I...

1050
00:46:42,673 --> 00:46:46,413
I have this vision of
doing it with puppets.

1051
00:46:48,273 --> 00:46:50,823
I mean, humans also, you know.

1052
00:46:52,433 --> 00:46:53,693
Why Dracula?

1053
00:46:53,793 --> 00:46:55,868
Because he's a man
like anyone else.

1054
00:46:55,968 --> 00:46:57,453
He just wants to be loved.

1055
00:46:57,553 --> 00:46:59,253
And every time he gets close
to a human woman,

1056
00:46:59,353 --> 00:47:00,893
he ends up smothering
and killing her,

1057
00:47:00,993 --> 00:47:03,493
which is a feeling
I am familiar with.

1058
00:47:03,593 --> 00:47:05,453
What? That's just a joke.

1059
00:47:05,553 --> 00:47:07,553
- Oh, shit.
- What?

1060
00:47:08,073 --> 00:47:10,985
My ex. If I run, you run.

1061
00:47:12,473 --> 00:47:13,135
- Do you understand?

1062
00:47:13,235 --> 00:47:14,253
No, I don't understand at all.

1063
00:47:14,353 --> 00:47:16,093
Fucking motherfucker. Dipshit.

1064
00:47:16,193 --> 00:47:17,173
Rachel, what are you doing?

1065
00:47:17,273 --> 00:47:18,893
I thought I told you
to stay back on your island.

1066
00:47:18,993 --> 00:47:20,013
Take it easy, just
take it easy.

1067
00:47:20,113 --> 00:47:21,213
Yeah, you know what?
The deal was over April 9.

1068
00:47:21,313 --> 00:47:23,413
Well, the deal's back
on, motherfucker.

1069
00:47:23,513 --> 00:47:24,802
You ain't the chief
in this village.

1070
00:47:24,902 --> 00:47:25,373
I'm the chief.

1071
00:47:25,473 --> 00:47:26,493
Of the idiots?

1072
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:28,215
Rachel, let me handle
this. I know his friend.

1073
00:47:28,315 --> 00:47:29,173
Let me handle this, okay?

1074
00:47:29,273 --> 00:47:31,273
Go ahead.

1075
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:33,453
Hey, man, you remember
me from breakfast?

1076
00:47:33,553 --> 00:47:35,033
- Oh, yeah, the cocktail
guy, that's right.

1077
00:47:35,133 --> 00:47:36,133
Yeah.

1078
00:47:36,233 --> 00:47:37,917
This ain't the
breakfast buffet.

1079
00:47:38,017 --> 00:47:39,213
What, you with my girl?

1080
00:47:39,313 --> 00:47:41,373
Keeping her warm for
me at night, huh?

1081
00:47:41,473 --> 00:47:43,938
Hey, what are you doing here?

1082
00:47:47,313 --> 00:47:48,693
That's right. Just hit him.

1083
00:47:48,793 --> 00:47:50,013
Rachel, we gotta get
out of here. Rachel?

1084
00:47:50,113 --> 00:47:52,238
You get what you deserve.

1085
00:48:03,593 --> 00:48:04,593
Just a boy?

1086
00:48:04,693 --> 00:48:07,053
No, that dude was
a fucking man.

1087
00:48:07,153 --> 00:48:09,187
No, no, no. He's an asshole.

1088
00:48:09,287 --> 00:48:11,693
I can't believe
I ever dated him.

1089
00:48:11,793 --> 00:48:13,793
- You went nuts.
- Yeah.

1090
00:48:13,993 --> 00:48:16,427
You guys are dysfunctional.

1091
00:48:16,953 --> 00:48:18,291
You were like one
of those girls...

1092
00:48:18,391 --> 00:48:19,293
from Flavour of Love....

1093
00:48:19,393 --> 00:48:20,733
- From what?
- You were.

1094
00:48:20,833 --> 00:48:23,468
'I'll kill you.
I'll kill you.'

1095
00:48:23,913 --> 00:48:25,733
Okay, I'm gonna go
get us another round.

1096
00:48:25,833 --> 00:48:27,733
I'll grab it.
It's no big deal.

1097
00:48:27,833 --> 00:48:32,508
You don't have to dote on me.
I'm not that type of girl.

1098
00:48:43,633 --> 00:48:45,133
You look so hot.

1099
00:48:45,233 --> 00:48:46,054
Give me Crime Scene.

1100
00:48:46,154 --> 00:48:47,453
Give me dirty
Crime Scene girl.

1101
00:48:47,553 --> 00:48:49,613
André the Giant, out
of the shot, please.

1102
00:48:49,713 --> 00:48:52,603
Mutombo, out of
the shot, come on.

1103
00:49:18,913 --> 00:49:20,993
Did you know that
there's a picture...

1104
00:49:21,093 --> 00:49:22,093
of you flashing,

1105
00:49:22,193 --> 00:49:23,653
hanging in the men's room?

1106
00:49:23,753 --> 00:49:26,586
Yeah. I hate it so much.

1107
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:29,671
My jackass boyfriend
made me do it.

1108
00:49:29,771 --> 00:49:31,613
Keoki took it, right there.

1109
00:49:31,713 --> 00:49:33,733
And I asked him
to take it down,

1110
00:49:33,833 --> 00:49:37,973
but he said that it would ruin
the balance of the collage.

1111
00:49:38,073 --> 00:49:39,653
Do you want me to try
to get it down for you?

1112
00:49:39,753 --> 00:49:42,338
No. No, no, no,
he'll kill you.

1113
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:44,438
Like, really kill you.

1114
00:49:45,153 --> 00:49:47,703
But I have a surprise for you.

1115
00:49:47,913 --> 00:49:49,133
Really, what?

1116
00:49:49,233 --> 00:49:50,453
We're gonna take
a quick break.

1117
00:49:50,553 --> 00:49:51,771
Tonight we have a
special guest...

1118
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:52,493
from the mainland,

1119
00:49:52,593 --> 00:49:55,533
singing a song from
his Dracula musical,

1120
00:49:55,633 --> 00:49:59,458
please welcome to the stage,
Mr Peter Bretter.

1121
00:50:00,313 --> 00:50:01,413
Peter.

1122
00:50:01,513 --> 00:50:03,093
Yeah. Go get them, tiger.

1123
00:50:03,193 --> 00:50:05,193
Please don't.

1124
00:50:05,353 --> 00:50:06,773
Peter.

1125
00:50:06,873 --> 00:50:09,253
- Rachel...
- Dracula. Peter.

1126
00:50:14,393 --> 00:50:15,693
Get them.

1127
00:50:15,793 --> 00:50:17,793
What's up?

1128
00:50:23,113 --> 00:50:25,113
Thank you.

1129
00:50:27,113 --> 00:50:28,533
You know, I could
play something else.

1130
00:50:28,633 --> 00:50:30,053
I just think out of
context this might be...

1131
00:50:30,153 --> 00:50:32,153
Dracula musical.

1132
00:50:33,593 --> 00:50:35,593
Thank you.

1133
00:50:54,273 --> 00:50:57,394
It's getting kind of
hard to believe...

1134
00:50:57,494 --> 00:51:00,044
things are going to get better

1135
00:51:00,793 --> 00:51:04,079
I've been drowning
too long to believe...

1136
00:51:04,179 --> 00:51:06,644
that the tide's going to turn

1137
00:51:07,993 --> 00:51:11,456
And I've been living
too hard to believe...

1138
00:51:11,556 --> 00:51:14,446
things are going
to get easier now

1139
00:51:15,033 --> 00:51:18,319
I'm still trying to
shake off the pain...

1140
00:51:18,419 --> 00:51:20,884
from the lessons I've learned

1141
00:51:21,913 --> 00:51:25,688
And if I see Van Helsing,
I swear to the lord

1142
00:51:25,788 --> 00:51:27,788
I will slay him

1143
00:51:28,793 --> 00:51:32,873
Take it from me, but I swear
I won't let it be so

1144
00:51:35,153 --> 00:51:39,908
Blood will run down his face
when he is decapitated

1145
00:51:41,273 --> 00:51:43,152
His head on my mantle...

1146
00:51:43,252 --> 00:51:45,887
is how I will
let this one know

1147
00:51:46,433 --> 00:51:48,433
How much I love you

1148
00:51:55,513 --> 00:51:57,513
Die

1149
00:51:57,513 --> 00:51:59,513
Die

1150
00:51:59,633 --> 00:52:01,633
Die

1151
00:52:04,953 --> 00:52:06,953
I can't

1152
00:52:17,193 --> 00:52:18,933
Awesome.

1153
00:52:19,033 --> 00:52:21,033
Thank you.

1154
00:52:24,153 --> 00:52:25,373
Thank you.

1155
00:52:25,473 --> 00:52:28,373
So, I had a really, really
great time tonight.

1156
00:52:28,473 --> 00:52:28,773
- Yeah?

1157
00:52:28,873 --> 00:52:30,573
Yeah. I mean, it
got a little wild.

1158
00:52:30,673 --> 00:52:32,190
- 'A little'?
You can say that.

1159
00:52:32,290 --> 00:52:32,493
Yeah.

1160
00:52:32,593 --> 00:52:33,591
But it was really fun,

1161
00:52:33,691 --> 00:52:35,213
and you're so
cool, and it was...

1162
00:52:35,313 --> 00:52:36,933
Thank you for taking me out.

1163
00:52:37,033 --> 00:52:39,923
No, I had a great
time. Thank you.

1164
00:52:40,273 --> 00:52:42,273
- You did?
- Yeah.

1165
00:52:45,793 --> 00:52:47,793
I'm sorry.

1166
00:52:47,913 --> 00:52:49,677
I'm sorry, I
just... I don't...

1167
00:52:49,777 --> 00:52:51,893
I just don't wanna
complicate things.

1168
00:52:51,993 --> 00:52:53,333
- No, of course.
- Yeah?

1169
00:52:53,433 --> 00:52:56,453
No, no, no. Totally.
I totally get that.

1170
00:52:56,553 --> 00:52:58,613
- I had a great time.
- A handshake?

1171
00:52:58,713 --> 00:53:01,773
- Well, I don't know. Okay.
- All right, all right.

1172
00:53:01,873 --> 00:53:05,103
- All right. Get home safe.
- You, too.

1173
00:53:07,393 --> 00:53:09,393
- Thanks again.
- Bye.

1174
00:53:16,273 --> 00:53:19,743
I'm on a hammock with me lady

1175
00:53:19,873 --> 00:53:23,070
Watching the sea roll by

1176
00:53:25,273 --> 00:53:27,787
Things have been great now...

1177
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:31,030
'Cause we're in Hawaii

1178
00:53:32,833 --> 00:53:34,833
Hey, guys.

1179
00:53:35,313 --> 00:53:37,429
Hey, man. I'm Koonu.

1180
00:53:38,153 --> 00:53:39,698
Yeah. No, I
remember. I'm Peter.

1181
00:53:39,798 --> 00:53:41,293
We took a surf
lesson together.

1182
00:53:41,393 --> 00:53:42,725
Yeah, you're that guy...

1183
00:53:42,825 --> 00:53:44,733
that works with
Kaiser Permanente.

1184
00:53:44,833 --> 00:53:45,833
No, I'm Peter.

1185
00:53:45,933 --> 00:53:48,213
We had a nice talk
out on the water.

1186
00:53:48,313 --> 00:53:50,313
That's cool.

1187
00:53:51,833 --> 00:53:53,693
Okay, can I just
say something?

1188
00:53:53,793 --> 00:53:56,033
- I went on a date tonight
with Rachel, right?

1189
00:53:56,133 --> 00:53:57,133
That wasn't a date.

1190
00:53:57,233 --> 00:53:59,093
She's in customer
service, dude.

1191
00:53:59,193 --> 00:54:01,173
She took you out for charity.

1192
00:54:01,273 --> 00:54:03,115
It was a date, okay? Trust me.

1193
00:54:03,215 --> 00:54:05,373
I know a date, and
that was a date.

1194
00:54:05,473 --> 00:54:06,613
I bet you think
strippers like you, too.

1195
00:54:06,713 --> 00:54:09,453
- That's really not necessary.
- It's true.

1196
00:54:09,553 --> 00:54:10,670
Don't waste your time, man.

1197
00:54:10,770 --> 00:54:12,493
Believe me, it is a
nowhere road. I know.

1198
00:54:12,593 --> 00:54:15,413
Did you see her ex-boyfriend?
He is ridiculous.

1199
00:54:15,513 --> 00:54:17,653
Who, Greg? I love Greg, man.

1200
00:54:17,753 --> 00:54:20,373
I saw him beat up a
guy with a starfish.

1201
00:54:20,473 --> 00:54:22,336
- Okay, that's
just ridiculous.

1202
00:54:22,436 --> 00:54:23,373
That guy was me.

1203
00:54:23,473 --> 00:54:26,253
Dude, my homie over here,
on his honeymoon?

1204
00:54:26,353 --> 00:54:28,813
Getting as much sex
as he possibly can ever have.

1205
00:54:28,913 --> 00:54:30,573
Are you giving to her
hard and rough, dude?

1206
00:54:30,673 --> 00:54:32,673
Come on.

1207
00:54:33,393 --> 00:54:36,793
The wife wants me to
do certain things...

1208
00:54:36,889 --> 00:54:39,099
that I find inappropriate.

1209
00:54:39,153 --> 00:54:40,110
Let me just say...

1210
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:41,893
that if God was
a city planner,

1211
00:54:41,993 --> 00:54:46,498
he would not put a playground
next to a sewage system.

1212
00:54:47,833 --> 00:54:49,284
We're trying to fuck,

1213
00:54:49,384 --> 00:54:51,693
but we're not
having fun fucking.

1214
00:54:51,793 --> 00:54:53,358
We're just, like...

1215
00:54:53,458 --> 00:54:56,093
I'm stabbing her
private parts,

1216
00:54:58,113 --> 00:55:00,393
and it's not fun, and
it causes anxiety.

1217
00:55:00,493 --> 00:55:01,493
Fucking is...

1218
00:55:01,593 --> 00:55:03,093
And then when you're
not fucking...

1219
00:55:03,193 --> 00:55:04,566
- Hey, someone's
gotta stop him.

1220
00:55:04,666 --> 00:55:05,773
You're the butt of a joke.

1221
00:55:05,873 --> 00:55:08,228
Fucking this ring is...

1222
00:55:08,353 --> 00:55:09,893
Fuck.

1223
00:55:09,993 --> 00:55:12,033
It's gonna be all right.

1224
00:55:13,713 --> 00:55:15,713
Hi.

1225
00:55:16,353 --> 00:55:18,693
Hi, do you wanna
come back to bed?

1226
00:55:18,793 --> 00:55:20,793
Sure.

1227
00:55:22,793 --> 00:55:24,793
Have fun.

1228
00:55:25,513 --> 00:55:26,823
I like her hair.

1229
00:55:26,923 --> 00:55:30,408
I wonder if the carpet
matches her pubes.

1230
00:55:37,153 --> 00:55:39,153
Julian, what's up?

1231
00:55:41,153 --> 00:55:43,013
Oh.

1232
00:55:43,113 --> 00:55:45,113
God.

1233
00:55:54,113 --> 00:55:55,853
The show's been cancelled.

1234
00:55:55,953 --> 00:55:57,733
That's good, 'cause
that's what you wanted.

1235
00:55:57,833 --> 00:56:00,188
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

1236
00:56:01,473 --> 00:56:03,210
It's just... I guess

1237
00:56:03,310 --> 00:56:06,388
I thought we had
another year left.

1238
00:56:06,513 --> 00:56:08,573
It seems like we did,
and... This'll be good,

1239
00:56:08,673 --> 00:56:10,593
'cause it's been a
long-awaited transition...

1240
00:56:10,693 --> 00:56:11,693
into film for me.

1241
00:56:11,793 --> 00:56:13,833
Don't get me wrong,
but it's just...

1242
00:56:13,933 --> 00:56:14,933
It's a surprise.

1243
00:56:15,033 --> 00:56:16,613
Come on tour with me.

1244
00:56:16,713 --> 00:56:18,989
I'll serenade you every night...

1245
00:56:19,089 --> 00:56:21,293
in front of
thousands of women.

1246
00:56:21,393 --> 00:56:23,053
I didn't know you
were going on tour.

1247
00:56:23,153 --> 00:56:24,333
Yeah, I'm going in two weeks.

1248
00:56:24,433 --> 00:56:28,293
It's like an 18-month tour,
43 countries, Infant Sorrow,

1249
00:56:28,393 --> 00:56:30,413
and it's gonna be
a massive tour.

1250
00:56:30,513 --> 00:56:33,596
Yeah. I can't come
'cause I have a job.

1251
00:56:33,696 --> 00:56:35,413
I'm a working actress.

1252
00:56:35,513 --> 00:56:37,173
Not any more.

1253
00:56:37,273 --> 00:56:40,013
You're an unemployed
actress, perfect.

1254
00:56:40,113 --> 00:56:42,519
You could be the
queen of the groupies,

1255
00:56:42,619 --> 00:56:44,333
queen of the Sorrow Suckers.

1256
00:56:44,433 --> 00:56:46,583
The Sorrow Suckers.

1257
00:56:46,713 --> 00:56:47,713
Sorrow Suckers.

1258
00:56:47,813 --> 00:56:50,053
I don't know why
they call them that.

1259
00:56:50,153 --> 00:56:53,808
Mr and Mrs Snow, sorry.
Sorry to bother you.

1260
00:56:54,833 --> 00:56:55,633
The hotel wanted to offer you...

1261
00:56:55,733 --> 00:56:56,533
some complimentary
coconut cake.

1262
00:56:56,633 --> 00:56:58,103
It's from the hotel.

1263
00:56:58,203 --> 00:57:01,573
It's definitely not from
me personally, so...

1264
00:57:01,673 --> 00:57:03,733
- Yeah, thanks.
- Okay, great.

1265
00:57:03,833 --> 00:57:07,013
When were you planning
on telling me this?

1266
00:57:07,113 --> 00:57:10,573
- I just told you, then.
- Yeah. No, I know.

1267
00:57:10,673 --> 00:57:12,314
But telling me now...

1268
00:57:12,414 --> 00:57:15,258
isn't really the
same as telling me.

1269
00:57:15,358 --> 00:57:16,180
Well, look, you know,

1270
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:17,973
I've not told you I've
got genital herpes,

1271
00:57:18,073 --> 00:57:20,333
because it's not
inflamed at the moment.

1272
00:57:20,433 --> 00:57:21,701
Do you guys want
some champagne...

1273
00:57:21,801 --> 00:57:22,333
with your cake,

1274
00:57:22,433 --> 00:57:23,733
or do you want it
without your cake?

1275
00:57:23,833 --> 00:57:25,833
I don't drink.

1276
00:57:32,513 --> 00:57:36,693
All right, so I came here
to give you my demo. I just...

1277
00:57:36,793 --> 00:57:37,358
I worship you,

1278
00:57:37,458 --> 00:57:39,076
and I just wanted to
give you my demo.

1279
00:57:39,176 --> 00:57:41,301
Just take a listen and...

1280
00:57:42,177 --> 00:57:44,177
Okay.

1281
00:57:44,257 --> 00:57:45,027
'Cause you know what?

1282
00:57:45,127 --> 00:57:46,677
You don't wanna be
the guy sitting there,

1283
00:57:46,777 --> 00:57:49,337
watching BBC, and saying,

1284
00:57:49,457 --> 00:57:52,893
'Oh, I saw that guy.
He was my waiter,

1285
00:57:53,017 --> 00:57:54,716
'and I totally dismissed him...

1286
00:57:54,816 --> 00:57:56,797
like everyone else
does in his life.

1287
00:57:56,897 --> 00:57:58,637
'And I totally was wrong,

1288
00:57:58,737 --> 00:58:02,077
'because he's a major, major,
major influence on me now,

1289
00:58:02,177 --> 00:58:04,177
'and I feel terrible.'

1290
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:10,575
That stupid English
voice, was that me?

1291
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:13,420
Unfortunately, yes.

1292
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:16,973
You're really gonna like it.

1293
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:20,075
I'll listen to it
when you've gone.

1294
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:29,655
Hey, look, just don't
tell anyone at the hotel.

1295
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,240
- What's up, dude?
- What's up?

1296
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:42,833
Peter, I got some really
interesting news...

1297
00:58:42,933 --> 00:58:43,885
this morning.

1298
00:58:43,985 --> 00:58:45,760
Aldous gave you gonorrhoea?

1299
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:48,738
No. Why would I tell you that?

1300
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:51,215
Crime Scene was cancelled.

1301
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:53,340
Whoa.

1302
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:55,340
Wow.

1303
00:58:57,180 --> 00:58:59,853
- You all right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1304
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:03,480
I mean, I've been waiting
to take the next step,

1305
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:05,118
you know, into features
for a long time,

1306
00:59:05,218 --> 00:59:06,280
so it's a really good thing.

1307
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:09,673
This isn't The View.
I mean, we can have...

1308
00:59:09,773 --> 00:59:12,600
an honest talk about
this if we want.

1309
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:14,501
I don't wanna step out
of the spotlight...

1310
00:59:14,601 --> 00:59:15,520
and then be forgotten.

1311
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:18,080
I don't wanna disappear.
I'm freaked out.

1312
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:18,907
I wanna be honest.

1313
00:59:19,007 --> 00:59:20,640
I'm really freaked
out right now, okay?

1314
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:22,960
Because, seemingly,
the only actresses...

1315
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:24,560
that actually can survive...

1316
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:25,984
are the ones that
show their cooter,

1317
00:59:26,084 --> 00:59:27,560
and, excuse me, but
I refuse to do that.

1318
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:28,800
I have a little dignity.

1319
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:29,986
And I don't have the frame...

1320
00:59:30,086 --> 00:59:31,800
to support plastic
surgery. I would tip over.

1321
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:34,120
And I'm not gonna do that.
I'm not gonna exploit myself.

1322
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:36,053
Listen, you're gonna be fine.

1323
00:59:36,153 --> 00:59:38,440
You have a long
career ahead of you.

1324
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:41,960
You've got, like, four
years until you're 30.

1325
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:44,060
It's gonna be fine.

1326
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:49,920
- How are you?
- I'm screwed.

1327
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:53,325
Frankly, I don't
stand a chance.

1328
00:59:53,425 --> 00:59:55,200
No, I'll be fine.

1329
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:57,968
I've been quietly
stealing money...

1330
00:59:58,068 --> 00:59:59,960
from you for a long time.

1331
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:03,155
You're always good
at cheering me up.

1332
01:00:03,255 --> 01:00:05,255
Pete, thank you.

1333
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:08,620
Die

1334
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:10,700
Die

1335
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:12,820
Die

1336
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:16,820
I can't

1337
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:21,250
It's really good, Peter.

1338
01:00:21,350 --> 01:00:23,160
I just don't understand
it. I don't.

1339
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:24,522
I mean, just chalk
it up to that.

1340
01:00:24,622 --> 01:00:26,360
Please don't play it
again, 'cause I don't...

1341
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:30,030
Just listen to it one
more time and see...

1342
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:32,500
Where's Aldous?

1343
01:00:33,489 --> 01:00:34,729
- Mr Snow, may I
ask you a question?

1344
01:00:34,829 --> 01:00:35,829
Okay.

1345
01:00:35,929 --> 01:00:38,789
I want to please my wife here,
on our honeymoon,

1346
01:00:38,889 --> 01:00:40,029
but I don't know
what I'm doing.

1347
01:00:40,129 --> 01:00:41,589
You having
difficulty sex-wise?

1348
01:00:41,689 --> 01:00:43,256
- Do you not know
how to use this?

1349
01:00:43,356 --> 01:00:43,829
I know how.

1350
01:00:43,929 --> 01:00:46,509
- Have you had sex before?
- We can't.

1351
01:00:46,609 --> 01:00:47,989
- Why?
- Our religion.

1352
01:00:48,089 --> 01:00:49,509
Right, 'cause of
God and everything?

1353
01:00:49,609 --> 01:00:50,709
Hey, that's not
gonna be a problem,

1354
01:00:50,809 --> 01:00:52,949
because God should be present
in the bedroom.

1355
01:00:53,049 --> 01:00:55,429
Just tell me specifically
what I need to do.

1356
01:00:55,529 --> 01:00:56,643
You need to penetrate deeply...

1357
01:00:56,743 --> 01:00:58,269
and stimulate the
clitoris simultaneously.

1358
01:00:58,369 --> 01:01:00,069
That's what you gotta do.
That's what it's about.

1359
01:01:00,169 --> 01:01:01,294
If you can involve
the anus in that,

1360
01:01:01,394 --> 01:01:02,389
then that's absolute
perfection.

1361
01:01:02,489 --> 01:01:03,469
Got it.

1362
01:01:03,569 --> 01:01:05,685
Explore her ears.

1363
01:01:05,809 --> 01:01:09,029
Find it in you to be
a little more circly.

1364
01:01:09,129 --> 01:01:10,149
You are a man.

1365
01:01:10,249 --> 01:01:11,389
God's within you.

1366
01:01:11,489 --> 01:01:12,789
I actually feel okay about it.

1367
01:01:12,889 --> 01:01:13,966
You know, I'm a little scared,

1368
01:01:14,066 --> 01:01:15,669
but I'll be all right.
I'll get another job.

1369
01:01:15,769 --> 01:01:16,720
That's interesting, man.

1370
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:18,189
You know what else
is interesting?

1371
01:01:18,289 --> 01:01:20,962
- What?
- Me on the moon.

1372
01:01:21,089 --> 01:01:22,664
I just wanna talk to
you about something.

1373
01:01:22,764 --> 01:01:23,229
Can you stop?

1374
01:01:23,329 --> 01:01:25,097
- All right, I'm just
gonna talk, and then...

1375
01:01:25,197 --> 01:01:25,309
Air.

1376
01:01:25,409 --> 01:01:27,151
There was this
interesting moment...

1377
01:01:27,251 --> 01:01:27,749
with Sarah.

1378
01:01:27,849 --> 01:01:29,369
Whoa, what? I don't
wanna hear about...

1379
01:01:29,469 --> 01:01:31,069
your interesting moment
with Sarah, Pete.

1380
01:01:31,169 --> 01:01:32,299
Then who am I supposed
to talk to...

1381
01:01:32,399 --> 01:01:32,709
about this?

1382
01:01:32,809 --> 01:01:34,426
Well, not me, because
have I ever had...

1383
01:01:34,526 --> 01:01:36,309
an interesting moment
with an ex-girlfriend?

1384
01:01:36,409 --> 01:01:37,689
- Do you have an
ex-girlfriend? No.

1385
01:01:37,789 --> 01:01:38,789
No.

1386
01:01:38,889 --> 01:01:40,889
LIZ: No.

1387
01:01:41,129 --> 01:01:42,403
I would really love to get...

1388
01:01:42,503 --> 01:01:44,189
the woman's perspective
on the matter.

1389
01:01:44,289 --> 01:01:45,709
- Really?
- No.

1390
01:01:45,809 --> 01:01:47,429
But come on in
and just sit down.

1391
01:01:47,529 --> 01:01:48,366
- Stay. You have to...

1392
01:01:48,466 --> 01:01:50,029
Honey, no, no, the
camera's right there.

1393
01:01:50,129 --> 01:01:50,322
No, I know,

1394
01:01:50,422 --> 01:01:51,189
but I just wanna
tell him, though....

1395
01:01:51,289 --> 01:01:52,097
- No, the camera...

1396
01:01:52,197 --> 01:01:53,909
Think about how much
she's hurt you....

1397
01:01:54,009 --> 01:01:54,989
- Hey, Liz?
- Yeah?

1398
01:01:55,089 --> 01:01:56,318
I think you need to
move just a tiny bit...

1399
01:01:56,418 --> 01:01:57,349
further away from
the microphone.

1400
01:01:57,449 --> 01:01:58,429
- Just...
- No, closer....

1401
01:01:58,529 --> 01:01:59,549
- Now a little further.
- Okay....

1402
01:01:59,649 --> 01:02:00,629
- Closer.
- And then......

1403
01:02:00,729 --> 01:02:02,700
- And then a little
further, and then closer.

1404
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:03,469
I don't know....

1405
01:02:03,569 --> 01:02:04,589
- Keep your head down, though.
- I'm bad at this thing....

1406
01:02:04,689 --> 01:02:06,189
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah, closer. Further away.

1407
01:02:06,289 --> 01:02:09,029
I know what you're doing.
That's not funny at all....

1408
01:02:09,129 --> 01:02:11,129
- You stop that.
- What?

1409
01:02:11,809 --> 01:02:12,915
- What's he doing?

1410
01:02:13,015 --> 01:02:15,020
Come on. Yeah,
yeah, real funny.

1411
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:16,140
Hey, that's a great
necklace, Liz.

1412
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:17,617
- Did you have
that a second ago?

1413
01:02:17,717 --> 01:02:18,100
Thank you.

1414
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:20,060
That's gross.

1415
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:21,420
- LIZ: I don't get it.
- Stop it....

1416
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:23,920
- He's saying if I were
to sperm on you...

1417
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:25,020
What?

1418
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:26,880
...it would be a
pearl necklace.

1419
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:27,980
Why?

1420
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:30,080
- Real funny.
- Sorry.

1421
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:33,220
Hey, Dracula.

1422
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:35,650
'And when I see Van Helsing,

1423
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:38,810
I swear to the Lord,
I'll slay him.'

1424
01:02:39,462 --> 01:02:41,657
That shit is funny, dude.

1425
01:02:41,782 --> 01:02:43,202
Hey, Pete.

1426
01:02:43,302 --> 01:02:45,762
So I was gonna go over
to Lazy Joe's later tonight,

1427
01:02:45,862 --> 01:02:47,275
and I wanted to see...

1428
01:02:47,375 --> 01:02:49,386
if you wanted to
come and join.

1429
01:02:49,486 --> 01:02:50,478
I think I'm confused,

1430
01:02:50,578 --> 01:02:52,066
because I thought
last night...

1431
01:02:52,166 --> 01:02:54,288
Oh, my God. Dude,
get out of your head.

1432
01:02:54,388 --> 01:02:55,786
It's really nice out here.

1433
01:02:55,886 --> 01:02:58,446
Yeah, I bet it is.

1434
01:02:58,566 --> 01:02:59,586
All right, yeah.
You know what?

1435
01:02:59,686 --> 01:03:01,026
I could totally use a
friendly hangout, so...

1436
01:03:01,126 --> 01:03:02,106
All right.

1437
01:03:02,206 --> 01:03:03,586
I don't know if you want,
instead of Lazy Joe's.

1438
01:03:03,686 --> 01:03:05,546
I was thinking of going
to Laie Point right now.

1439
01:03:05,646 --> 01:03:06,826
- Really?
- Yeah.

1440
01:03:06,926 --> 01:03:10,186
I heard that place
was a pain in the ass.

1441
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:12,286
Okay.

1442
01:03:12,646 --> 01:03:13,786
- Hey.
Yo, what's up, guys?

1443
01:03:13,886 --> 01:03:14,946
We're just going for a hike.

1444
01:03:15,046 --> 01:03:17,586
No, you're not, you're
going snorkelling.

1445
01:03:17,686 --> 01:03:18,986
I think we're
gonna go on a hike.

1446
01:03:19,086 --> 01:03:21,006
It is sea turtle
fucking season, dude.

1447
01:03:21,106 --> 01:03:22,106
Let's go.

1448
01:03:22,206 --> 01:03:24,006
They fuck for
three hours, dude.

1449
01:03:24,106 --> 01:03:25,386
I mean, that's magical.

1450
01:03:25,486 --> 01:03:26,235
- No, we're going on a hike.

1451
01:03:26,335 --> 01:03:27,226
I think we'll go
on a hike, yeah.

1452
01:03:27,326 --> 01:03:29,326
What? Your loss.

1453
01:03:30,286 --> 01:03:33,686
Why won't anybody
go snorkelling with me?

1454
01:03:38,046 --> 01:03:40,171
How you doing back there?

1455
01:03:41,126 --> 01:03:42,426
Awesome.

1456
01:03:42,526 --> 01:03:45,666
I don't think I've ever been
this covered in sweat before.

1457
01:03:45,766 --> 01:03:47,706
It's like I have
some sort of fever.

1458
01:03:47,806 --> 01:03:50,094
I told you this was
a pain in the ass.

1459
01:03:50,194 --> 01:03:51,866
Could've been at Lazy Joe's.

1460
01:03:51,966 --> 01:03:53,466
- Oh, yeah.
- Uh-huh.

1461
01:03:53,566 --> 01:03:55,186
Oh, shit.

1462
01:03:55,286 --> 01:03:57,286
- You good?
- No.

1463
01:03:59,926 --> 01:04:02,386
Wow, we're really going
up to the edge of this, huh?

1464
01:04:02,486 --> 01:04:04,486
Look.

1465
01:04:07,726 --> 01:04:10,276
Wow, this is really beautiful.

1466
01:04:13,046 --> 01:04:15,159
All right, so now that
your show's done,

1467
01:04:15,259 --> 01:04:17,426
are you gonna finish
the Dracula musical?

1468
01:04:17,526 --> 01:04:19,991
It's not that easy, you know.

1469
01:04:20,646 --> 01:04:23,146
Sarah always thought
it was crazy, and...

1470
01:04:23,246 --> 01:04:25,142
Well, you're definitely crazy.

1471
01:04:25,242 --> 01:04:27,786
But so is everyone,
right? So who cares?

1472
01:04:27,886 --> 01:04:30,046
- I just don't feel
like doing anything.

1473
01:04:30,146 --> 01:04:31,146
Why?

1474
01:04:31,246 --> 01:04:32,386
'Cause my heart is broken,

1475
01:04:32,486 --> 01:04:35,146
and I can't imagine
doing anything right now.

1476
01:04:35,246 --> 01:04:37,799
It's probably the same reason...

1477
01:04:37,899 --> 01:04:41,129
you don't go back to
school, you know?

1478
01:04:42,406 --> 01:04:43,966
Maybe it's good we
got hurt like that,

1479
01:04:44,066 --> 01:04:45,066
you know?

1480
01:04:45,166 --> 01:04:46,949
I don't know about you,

1481
01:04:47,049 --> 01:04:50,186
but it makes me feel
impervious to pain.

1482
01:04:50,286 --> 01:04:51,474
Yeah. Kind of like...

1483
01:04:51,574 --> 01:04:53,706
there's nothing left
to be afraid of.

1484
01:04:53,806 --> 01:04:56,274
- Yeah. No, exactly.
- Right.

1485
01:04:56,406 --> 01:04:58,736
We could leap off this rock,

1486
01:04:58,836 --> 01:05:02,236
and it won't hurt us
as bad as they did.

1487
01:05:02,566 --> 01:05:04,346
So jump, then.

1488
01:05:04,446 --> 01:05:06,666
No, I meant that,
like, as a metaphor, you know?

1489
01:05:06,766 --> 01:05:08,766
No. Just do it.

1490
01:05:11,566 --> 01:05:14,205
You'll be fine. Jump.

1491
01:05:19,846 --> 01:05:21,846
What the hell?

1492
01:05:23,606 --> 01:05:27,176
Oh, God. Oh, God. I
made her kill herself.

1493
01:05:31,766 --> 01:05:33,386
You must be crazy.

1494
01:05:33,486 --> 01:05:35,166
- So are you gonna
jump or what?

1495
01:05:35,266 --> 01:05:36,266
No.

1496
01:05:36,366 --> 01:05:37,369
Come on, Peter.

1497
01:05:37,469 --> 01:05:39,666
I can see your
vagina from here.

1498
01:05:39,766 --> 01:05:42,326
I can see your hoo-ha.

1499
01:05:42,446 --> 01:05:44,641
I mean, I'll jump.

1500
01:05:44,766 --> 01:05:46,766
Chicken. Come on.

1501
01:06:02,406 --> 01:06:05,682
Please, God, don't
let me die today.

1502
01:06:07,286 --> 01:06:09,066
- I'm okay.
- Okay.

1503
01:06:09,166 --> 01:06:11,906
- I'll just let go, right?
- No, no, no.

1504
01:06:12,006 --> 01:06:13,850
If you fall straight down,

1505
01:06:13,950 --> 01:06:17,106
you'd probably hit a
rock and kill yourself.

1506
01:06:17,206 --> 01:06:19,026
- Totally.
- Yeah.

1507
01:06:19,126 --> 01:06:20,226
So what do I do?

1508
01:06:20,326 --> 01:06:22,946
Why don't you press your feet
up against the rock,

1509
01:06:23,046 --> 01:06:24,946
and, like, shoot yourself off.

1510
01:06:25,046 --> 01:06:26,626
- What, like a frog?
- I don't know, Peter.

1511
01:06:26,726 --> 01:06:29,276
Just get off the fucking rock.

1512
01:06:29,326 --> 01:06:31,521
- Here I go.
- Okay.

1513
01:06:31,646 --> 01:06:33,646
One.

1514
01:06:34,606 --> 01:06:36,266
Two.

1515
01:06:36,366 --> 01:06:38,366
Two.

1516
01:06:40,166 --> 01:06:42,236
- Two and a half.
- Jump.

1517
01:06:42,366 --> 01:06:44,366
Three.

1518
01:06:56,606 --> 01:07:00,076
Oh, my God. Oh, my
God. Oh, my God.

1519
01:07:00,206 --> 01:07:01,906
- You saw that, right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I saw it.

1520
01:07:02,006 --> 01:07:04,386
I was there. I witnessed it.

1521
01:07:04,406 --> 01:07:06,406
Thanks.

1522
01:07:12,126 --> 01:07:14,126
Come on.

1523
01:07:20,966 --> 01:07:24,196
You've got Christ
between your thighs,

1524
01:07:25,046 --> 01:07:27,171
but with a shorter beard.

1525
01:07:27,486 --> 01:07:30,046
- Mahalo.
- Aloha....

1526
01:07:30,446 --> 01:07:32,746
- Sex.
- I'm cramping, I'm cramping.

1527
01:07:32,846 --> 01:07:34,846
- Okay.
- Okay, okay.

1528
01:07:36,526 --> 01:07:38,835
Petey? Petey?

1529
01:07:42,526 --> 01:07:45,120
Sorry. I knocked a bunch.

1530
01:07:45,246 --> 01:07:47,966
You were really out.
Ken sent me.

1531
01:07:48,132 --> 01:07:51,152
Dakota Fanning and her people,
they need this room.

1532
01:07:51,252 --> 01:07:53,252
She loves it here.

1533
01:07:53,732 --> 01:07:55,392
Oh.

1534
01:07:55,492 --> 01:07:56,592
So does that mean I have
to leave the hotel?

1535
01:07:56,692 --> 01:07:58,692
Ken found you a room.

1536
01:07:59,612 --> 01:08:00,974
I'll take it, yeah.

1537
01:08:01,074 --> 01:08:04,218
I wanna hang out with
Rachel a little more.

1538
01:08:04,318 --> 01:08:07,633
Are those sad tissues
or happy tissues?

1539
01:08:11,118 --> 01:08:14,433
Maybe you should just
give me a minute.

1540
01:08:16,798 --> 01:08:19,631
It was the only
room available.

1541
01:08:19,758 --> 01:08:21,758
I'm sure it was.

1542
01:08:24,998 --> 01:08:27,338
- Hey, how's it going?
- It's all right.

1543
01:08:27,438 --> 01:08:28,778
Really?

1544
01:08:28,878 --> 01:08:30,389
I think you got
some pain behind...

1545
01:08:30,489 --> 01:08:32,178
those eyes. A kind
of pain that only...

1546
01:08:32,278 --> 01:08:33,858
Okay, you know what?
Let's cut the bullshit.

1547
01:08:33,958 --> 01:08:35,978
I wanna stand up on a
wave before I leave.

1548
01:08:36,078 --> 01:08:37,818
I don't think you're
ready yet, man.

1549
01:08:37,918 --> 01:08:40,863
- I'm ready to ride
giants, Koonu.

1550
01:08:40,963 --> 01:08:42,963
I think you're ready.

1551
01:09:02,958 --> 01:09:04,958
Petey.

1552
01:09:09,158 --> 01:09:10,138
- Hi.
- Hi.

1553
01:09:10,238 --> 01:09:12,778
Miss Marshall, what
can I do for you?

1554
01:09:12,878 --> 01:09:15,338
Is there a place
to get good sushi around here?

1555
01:09:15,438 --> 01:09:17,523
Yeah. Yeah, there's a
really great place...

1556
01:09:17,623 --> 01:09:19,658
about five minutes from
here called Asuki.

1557
01:09:19,758 --> 01:09:21,138
Perfect.

1558
01:09:21,238 --> 01:09:22,399
- Do you want me
to get you a map?

1559
01:09:22,499 --> 01:09:22,698
Please.

1560
01:09:22,798 --> 01:09:24,538
Okay.

1561
01:09:24,638 --> 01:09:27,835
So, this is where we are.

1562
01:09:27,958 --> 01:09:29,437
Head down Kamehameha,

1563
01:09:29,537 --> 01:09:31,818
and then pass
Funaho Loko Marsh.

1564
01:09:31,918 --> 01:09:33,738
And it should be
right to the left.

1565
01:09:33,838 --> 01:09:35,938
It might take,
like, five minutes.

1566
01:09:36,038 --> 01:09:38,588
- Great. Thank you.
- Any time.

1567
01:09:41,918 --> 01:09:43,258
Um...

1568
01:09:43,358 --> 01:09:45,658
- I saw you with
Peter Bretter...

1569
01:09:45,758 --> 01:09:46,728
Yeah.

1570
01:09:46,828 --> 01:09:49,266
...who's my ex-boyfriend.

1571
01:09:49,398 --> 01:09:52,470
Oh, my God. I'm really sorry.

1572
01:09:52,598 --> 01:09:53,938
- No.
- It's not like that at all.

1573
01:09:54,038 --> 01:09:55,458
- It's not what you're...
- No, it's fine.

1574
01:09:55,558 --> 01:09:56,221
I'm just really glad...

1575
01:09:56,321 --> 01:09:57,418
you're keeping him
company, 'cause...

1576
01:09:57,518 --> 01:09:58,518
- Gosh, no.

1577
01:09:58,618 --> 01:10:00,138
...you seem like a
really nice person,

1578
01:10:00,238 --> 01:10:02,818
- and you're very pretty.
- Thank you.

1579
01:10:02,918 --> 01:10:05,218
Gosh, you're,
like, way prettier.

1580
01:10:05,318 --> 01:10:07,698
No, you're, like, so pretty.

1581
01:10:09,558 --> 01:10:11,558
Really?

1582
01:10:11,678 --> 01:10:14,988
- Yeah.
- Wow, thank you. Thank you.

1583
01:10:15,118 --> 01:10:17,098
And one more
thing about Peter.

1584
01:10:17,198 --> 01:10:20,644
He's a really good
guy. Really good.

1585
01:10:20,744 --> 01:10:22,830
Like, great, actually.

1586
01:10:23,278 --> 01:10:25,058
Yeah.

1587
01:10:25,158 --> 01:10:27,158
Um...

1588
01:10:29,798 --> 01:10:32,178
Please don't cry,
Miss Marshall.

1589
01:10:32,278 --> 01:10:34,898
God. Do you need me
to get you a tissue?

1590
01:10:34,998 --> 01:10:38,498
Oh, no, I'm good, I'm good.
I'm okay, I'm okay.

1591
01:10:38,598 --> 01:10:40,598
Okay.

1592
01:10:41,758 --> 01:10:45,668
- Thank you, Rachel.
- Any time, Miss Marshall.

1593
01:10:54,918 --> 01:10:56,918
Hey, ahoy, there.

1594
01:10:57,038 --> 01:10:58,578
You surf, too?

1595
01:10:58,678 --> 01:10:59,422
Good Lord, no.

1596
01:10:59,522 --> 01:11:01,458
I'm just drifting
around, you know?

1597
01:11:01,558 --> 01:11:04,268
Getting in touch with
the ocean and stuff.

1598
01:11:04,368 --> 01:11:05,698
It's really pleasant.

1599
01:11:05,798 --> 01:11:07,798
It was, yeah.

1600
01:11:08,878 --> 01:11:10,018
I'm gonna head in.

1601
01:11:10,118 --> 01:11:11,254
Before you go,
actually, Peter.

1602
01:11:11,354 --> 01:11:12,298
I just wanted to tell you.

1603
01:11:12,398 --> 01:11:13,921
I was listening to
Sarah's iPod...

1604
01:11:14,021 --> 01:11:14,618
the other day,

1605
01:11:14,718 --> 01:11:17,005
and amidst the
interminable dross...

1606
01:11:17,105 --> 01:11:18,418
that's on that thing.

1607
01:11:18,518 --> 01:11:20,538
I found one track
that I quite liked.

1608
01:11:20,638 --> 01:11:21,838
So I checked what it was,

1609
01:11:21,938 --> 01:11:23,538
and it was actually
one of yours.

1610
01:11:23,638 --> 01:11:26,733
And it kind of
reminded me of a dark,

1611
01:11:26,833 --> 01:11:29,507
gothic Neil Diamond.
It's great.

1612
01:11:29,607 --> 01:11:31,658
That's, like, exactly
what I'm going for.

1613
01:11:31,758 --> 01:11:33,758
Right, yeah.

1614
01:11:36,838 --> 01:11:38,838
Fuck.

1615
01:11:39,878 --> 01:11:41,878
Fuck, you're cool.

1616
01:11:42,878 --> 01:11:44,528
It's so hard to say,

1617
01:11:44,628 --> 01:11:48,198
because, like, I hate
you in so many ways,

1618
01:11:49,438 --> 01:11:51,298
but whatever.
I can see why Sarah likes you.

1619
01:11:51,398 --> 01:11:53,473
No accounting for
taste, I suppose.

1620
01:11:53,573 --> 01:11:54,738
In her case, anyway.

1621
01:11:54,838 --> 01:11:56,701
She was with me
for five years,

1622
01:11:56,801 --> 01:11:57,738
so there you go.

1623
01:11:57,838 --> 01:12:00,983
Yeah, you got four
on me there, mate.

1624
01:12:03,478 --> 01:12:05,618
You slept with
Sarah a year ago?

1625
01:12:05,718 --> 01:12:06,998
I thought you knew.

1626
01:12:07,098 --> 01:12:09,778
Peter, please, don't
take it seriously.

1627
01:12:09,878 --> 01:12:11,399
- What the fuck,
man. You've...

1628
01:12:11,499 --> 01:12:12,818
Don't get offended by that.

1629
01:12:12,918 --> 01:12:15,808
You can't be so
casual about this.

1630
01:12:17,078 --> 01:12:18,138
This isn't Europe, okay?
There are rules here.

1631
01:12:18,238 --> 01:12:19,252
I'm really sorry.

1632
01:12:19,352 --> 01:12:21,618
I apologise for
offending you, Peter.

1633
01:12:21,718 --> 01:12:24,698
I just hope this doesn't
ruin our friendship.

1634
01:12:24,798 --> 01:12:26,138
Well, what's that about?

1635
01:12:26,238 --> 01:12:29,138
What do you think it's about?
This is a big deal.

1636
01:12:29,238 --> 01:12:29,918
What about a code
of the ocean?

1637
01:12:30,018 --> 01:12:30,298
That's not on.

1638
01:12:30,398 --> 01:12:31,458
What about codes among men?

1639
01:12:31,558 --> 01:12:32,658
You don't sleep
with another man's girlfriend.

1640
01:12:32,758 --> 01:12:33,858
- Think of...
- Get out of here.

1641
01:12:33,958 --> 01:12:37,953
- All right, okay. All right.
- Get out of here.

1642
01:13:00,318 --> 01:13:02,318
Oh, God.

1643
01:13:21,758 --> 01:13:24,989
Koonu. This guy
needs help. Koonu.

1644
01:13:28,038 --> 01:13:29,786
- Should I call
the front desk?

1645
01:13:29,886 --> 01:13:30,938
It hurts. It hurts.

1646
01:13:31,038 --> 01:13:33,218
Wow, you got coral
right there in your leg.

1647
01:13:33,318 --> 01:13:34,386
Can you get it out
of my leg, please,

1648
01:13:34,486 --> 01:13:34,738
hotel man?

1649
01:13:34,838 --> 01:13:35,858
Can you do something
about that?

1650
01:13:35,958 --> 01:13:37,947
I'd love to, you know,
but hotel policy...

1651
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:39,938
They don't let me do
that kind of thing.

1652
01:13:40,038 --> 01:13:41,858
They get all weirded
out. Insurance...

1653
01:13:41,958 --> 01:13:43,698
Koonu, can you call
the front desk for me, please?

1654
01:13:43,798 --> 01:13:45,338
- Yeah.
- It really hurts.

1655
01:13:45,438 --> 01:13:48,236
Koonu, call the
front desk now.

1656
01:13:48,358 --> 01:13:50,358
Okay, monster man.

1657
01:13:50,358 --> 01:13:52,018
Pete, he's not
gonna do nothing.

1658
01:13:52,118 --> 01:13:53,938
I kind of have this
thing about blood, okay?

1659
01:13:54,038 --> 01:13:55,468
Look at it. It's
raping my leg.

1660
01:13:55,568 --> 01:13:57,618
Peter, get it out of my
fucking leg, please.

1661
01:13:57,718 --> 01:13:59,754
One, two.

1662
01:13:59,878 --> 01:14:01,898
- You can't get it out.
- It's really in there.

1663
01:14:01,998 --> 01:14:04,293
- Get it out of me.
- Three.

1664
01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:06,468
Fuck my arse.

1665
01:14:06,598 --> 01:14:09,338
Okay, I got it. It's
all done. It's all over.

1666
01:14:09,438 --> 01:14:11,438
Everything looks fine.

1667
01:14:13,918 --> 01:14:16,658
It's all good. They're
coming wiki wiki.

1668
01:14:16,758 --> 01:14:18,907
Can you get some
towels for me, please?

1669
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:20,818
I'm really losing
a lot of blood.

1670
01:14:20,918 --> 01:14:22,818
You sound like
you're from London.

1671
01:14:22,918 --> 01:14:24,954
Yeah, I'm from London.

1672
01:14:30,118 --> 01:14:31,858
What's going on?

1673
01:14:31,958 --> 01:14:32,958
You fainted.

1674
01:14:33,058 --> 01:14:35,858
I didn't want you to
wake up by yourself.

1675
01:14:35,958 --> 01:14:38,158
- How's your friend?
Is he all right?

1676
01:14:38,258 --> 01:14:39,258
Yeah.

1677
01:14:39,358 --> 01:14:41,618
They gave him stitches,
and he's sleeping it off.

1678
01:14:41,718 --> 01:14:43,418
- Hey, you wanna hear
something funny?

1679
01:14:43,518 --> 01:14:43,698
What?

1680
01:14:43,798 --> 01:14:45,938
Are you ready to laugh?
'Cause this is a gas.

1681
01:14:46,038 --> 01:14:47,218
Okay.

1682
01:14:47,318 --> 01:14:48,939
Edward Scissorhands
over there told me...

1683
01:14:49,039 --> 01:14:50,578
that you two were
fucking each other...

1684
01:14:50,678 --> 01:14:53,178
for a whole God damn year
while we were together.

1685
01:14:53,278 --> 01:14:54,298
Shit.

1686
01:14:54,398 --> 01:14:56,018
How about that, Sarah?

1687
01:14:56,118 --> 01:14:58,118
I'm sorry, Peter.

1688
01:14:58,878 --> 01:15:00,026
Pete, you shouldn't be up...

1689
01:15:00,126 --> 01:15:01,658
and walking around.
Can you please...

1690
01:15:01,758 --> 01:15:04,218
Please don't touch me.
Just don't touch me, okay?

1691
01:15:04,318 --> 01:15:05,898
I'm not touching you.

1692
01:15:05,998 --> 01:15:08,803
Will you just
please sit? Please?

1693
01:15:09,238 --> 01:15:10,228
All right, I'll sit down,

1694
01:15:10,328 --> 01:15:11,858
but I'm sitting down
'cause I want to,

1695
01:15:11,958 --> 01:15:15,871
not because you've
asked me to sit, okay?

1696
01:15:15,998 --> 01:15:17,998
Great.

1697
01:15:22,918 --> 01:15:24,918
A year?

1698
01:15:24,918 --> 01:15:27,458
Listen, I get it,
okay? I just...

1699
01:15:27,558 --> 01:15:29,033
I need to understand
what I did...

1700
01:15:29,133 --> 01:15:30,338
to make you cheat. I just...

1701
01:15:30,438 --> 01:15:36,547
Pete, it's not
anything you did.

1702
01:15:36,678 --> 01:15:40,298
You didn't do anything.
I mean, you were great.

1703
01:15:40,398 --> 01:15:41,879
Will you please
cut the bullshit...

1704
01:15:41,979 --> 01:15:42,978
and have a talk with me?

1705
01:15:43,078 --> 01:15:45,797
Fine. Cutting the bullshit.

1706
01:15:47,638 --> 01:15:48,742
It got really hard to keep
taking care of you...

1707
01:15:48,842 --> 01:15:49,778
when you stopped taking
care of yourself.

1708
01:15:49,878 --> 01:15:51,058
I tried to get you
out of the house.

1709
01:15:51,158 --> 01:15:53,869
I tried to get you off
your little island...

1710
01:15:53,969 --> 01:15:55,738
you loved so much, the couch.

1711
01:15:55,838 --> 01:15:57,418
You didn't wanna see
the light of day.

1712
01:15:57,518 --> 01:15:59,571
God, there was one week...

1713
01:15:59,671 --> 01:16:02,731
when you wore
sweatpants. Every day.

1714
01:16:06,358 --> 01:16:09,748
You shall not pass.

1715
01:16:10,918 --> 01:16:12,457
You know what? If they
were Sean John...

1716
01:16:12,557 --> 01:16:13,938
sweatpants, it would
have been fine.

1717
01:16:14,038 --> 01:16:15,374
But because they're
Costco brand,

1718
01:16:15,474 --> 01:16:16,978
it's like the worst
thing I could do.

1719
01:16:17,078 --> 01:16:18,866
That has nothing
to do with it.

1720
01:16:18,966 --> 01:16:20,458
That's what you don't get.

1721
01:16:20,558 --> 01:16:22,256
I'm sorry that I
didn't end up being...

1722
01:16:22,356 --> 01:16:24,098
who we thought I was
gonna be, you know?

1723
01:16:24,198 --> 01:16:26,866
I tried really hard.
I promise you that.

1724
01:16:26,966 --> 01:16:28,818
I just didn't have it in me.

1725
01:16:28,918 --> 01:16:31,218
I think if you had just,
maybe tried harder.

1726
01:16:31,318 --> 01:16:33,513
I tried.

1727
01:16:33,638 --> 01:16:36,018
You have no idea how
hard I tried, Peter.

1728
01:16:36,118 --> 01:16:37,618
I talked to a therapist.

1729
01:16:37,718 --> 01:16:39,898
I talked to my mother.
I read every book possible.

1730
01:16:39,998 --> 01:16:42,018
I took love seminars.
I took sex seminars.

1731
01:16:42,118 --> 01:16:42,861
None of it worked.

1732
01:16:42,961 --> 01:16:44,498
None of it made a
difference to you.

1733
01:16:44,598 --> 01:16:47,886
And I couldn't drown
with you any more.

1734
01:16:47,986 --> 01:16:52,378
Don't you dare sit there
and tell me that I didn't try.

1735
01:16:52,478 --> 01:16:54,478
I did.

1736
01:16:54,478 --> 01:16:57,453
You were just too
stupid to notice.

1737
01:17:28,438 --> 01:17:30,314
Whoa. I thought you
were gonna wear...

1738
01:17:30,414 --> 01:17:31,378
the shirt I got you.

1739
01:17:31,478 --> 01:17:33,098
What? No.

1740
01:17:33,198 --> 01:17:35,778
I mean, I do love that
shirt you got me.

1741
01:17:35,878 --> 01:17:38,378
I admire Sir Tommy
Bahama an awful lot.

1742
01:17:38,478 --> 01:17:40,128
He's a talented man,

1743
01:17:40,228 --> 01:17:44,053
but tonight, I feel that
this is appropriate.

1744
01:17:47,198 --> 01:17:50,768
Wow, thank you. Yeah,
Sarah got it for me.

1745
01:17:51,838 --> 01:17:54,758
This is, like, way
more convenient...

1746
01:17:54,858 --> 01:17:56,858
than my backpack.

1747
01:17:58,158 --> 01:17:59,178
Awesome hat.

1748
01:17:59,278 --> 01:17:59,669
Thank you.

1749
01:17:59,769 --> 01:18:01,218
Yeah, my girlfriend
got it for me.

1750
01:18:01,318 --> 01:18:03,868
- I'm fucking with you.
- Cool.

1751
01:18:08,073 --> 01:18:11,388
Sarah, can I use this
lipstick, please?

1752
01:18:15,393 --> 01:18:18,191
Sure. I don't care.

1753
01:18:20,817 --> 01:18:21,330
I think it looks great.

1754
01:18:21,430 --> 01:18:22,237
But if you're not,
let's go change.

1755
01:18:22,337 --> 01:18:24,282
No, I like it. I didn't
like it at first.

1756
01:18:24,382 --> 01:18:25,597
Now I really think it's...

1757
01:18:25,697 --> 01:18:27,277
Oh, bloody hell. This
is a small resort.

1758
01:18:27,377 --> 01:18:29,377
Hi, Peter.

1759
01:18:31,057 --> 01:18:33,057
Hey. Wow.

1760
01:18:33,777 --> 01:18:35,957
Aldous, Sarah, this is Rachel.

1761
01:18:36,057 --> 01:18:38,366
Sarah bought me this shirt.

1762
01:18:38,497 --> 01:18:39,757
I could've guessed that. Yeah.

1763
01:18:39,857 --> 01:18:40,957
- Looks great.
- You look great.

1764
01:18:41,057 --> 01:18:42,797
Looks awesome.

1765
01:18:42,897 --> 01:18:44,933
- See.
- Thanks.

1766
01:18:45,057 --> 01:18:46,517
Mr Snow, I'm so sorry.

1767
01:18:46,617 --> 01:18:49,037
I did not know you
guys were coming.

1768
01:18:49,137 --> 01:18:50,117
You're gonna have to
wait five minutes.

1769
01:18:50,217 --> 01:18:51,237
I did not know you
guys were coming.

1770
01:18:51,337 --> 01:18:52,957
It's okay. It's not a problem.

1771
01:18:53,057 --> 01:18:54,677
I didn't see you guys, so...

1772
01:18:54,777 --> 01:18:57,412
There's really
no need to weep.

1773
01:18:57,937 --> 01:18:59,937
I'm not crying.

1774
01:19:00,817 --> 01:19:03,477
It's no problem, honestly.
It's not a problem.

1775
01:19:03,577 --> 01:19:05,417
- So, your table
is ready, guys.

1776
01:19:05,517 --> 01:19:06,517
Oh, great.

1777
01:19:06,617 --> 01:19:08,077
Hey, have a lovely
evening, you two.

1778
01:19:08,177 --> 01:19:09,506
- Thank you. Have a
great dinner, you guys.

1779
01:19:09,606 --> 01:19:09,877
Thank you.

1780
01:19:09,977 --> 01:19:10,909
You're welcome to
join us, obviously,

1781
01:19:11,009 --> 01:19:11,277
if you want.

1782
01:19:11,377 --> 01:19:13,117
- Okay.
- Wouldn't dream of it. What?

1783
01:19:13,217 --> 01:19:15,217
What?

1784
01:19:15,337 --> 01:19:17,037
- Oh, okay.
- Okay.

1785
01:19:17,137 --> 01:19:18,717
That's great. Awesome.
- Sure.

1786
01:19:18,817 --> 01:19:19,997
Great. I'll just
set two more places.

1787
01:19:20,097 --> 01:19:21,077
- Okay.
- Not a big deal.

1788
01:19:21,177 --> 01:19:22,517
Awesome.

1789
01:19:22,617 --> 01:19:27,077
So this is actually happening.
We're gonna let this happen.

1790
01:19:27,177 --> 01:19:28,157
I am so sorry.

1791
01:19:28,257 --> 01:19:30,077
I never thought in
a million years...

1792
01:19:30,177 --> 01:19:31,037
she would say yes.

1793
01:19:31,137 --> 01:19:32,117
I did.

1794
01:19:32,217 --> 01:19:33,888
What? I just accepted
an invitation.

1795
01:19:33,988 --> 01:19:35,037
I didn't wanna be rude.

1796
01:19:35,137 --> 01:19:36,757
It's got us in a
terrible situation.

1797
01:19:36,857 --> 01:19:37,850
Now I'm gonna have
to sit with him...

1798
01:19:37,950 --> 01:19:38,717
wearing this shirt all night.

1799
01:19:38,817 --> 01:19:40,477
You're wearing the
shirt regardless.

1800
01:19:40,577 --> 01:19:42,237
Australia is amazing.

1801
01:19:42,337 --> 01:19:44,537
- I'm telling you. It is
a great place to shoot.

1802
01:19:44,637 --> 01:19:45,637
Yeah?

1803
01:19:45,737 --> 01:19:48,837
Rachel, you would love it.
You would love it.

1804
01:19:48,937 --> 01:19:51,517
I wanna go. I really,
really wanna go there.

1805
01:19:51,617 --> 01:19:53,537
- Wait, so when's
the movie coming out?

1806
01:19:53,637 --> 01:19:54,637
Mmm.

1807
01:19:54,737 --> 01:19:56,477
It came out.

1808
01:19:56,577 --> 01:19:59,212
- It was already released.
- Oh.

1809
01:20:01,017 --> 01:20:02,797
Well, you know,
it's an island.

1810
01:20:02,897 --> 01:20:03,917
It's isolated.

1811
01:20:04,017 --> 01:20:04,196
- Yeah.

1812
01:20:04,296 --> 01:20:05,357
Movies don't really
come out here.

1813
01:20:05,457 --> 01:20:07,877
- Obviously.
- Did you like it?

1814
01:20:07,977 --> 01:20:09,977
- The movie?
- Yeah.

1815
01:20:10,537 --> 01:20:12,597
- It was...
- Awful bloody film.

1816
01:20:12,697 --> 01:20:14,757
I say, it's just a
ridiculous premise.

1817
01:20:14,857 --> 01:20:16,153
What would happen...

1818
01:20:16,253 --> 01:20:18,357
if your mobile
phone killed you?

1819
01:20:18,457 --> 01:20:19,847
Why would a mobile
phone kill anyone?

1820
01:20:19,947 --> 01:20:20,637
Doesn't make sense.

1821
01:20:20,737 --> 01:20:22,494
How can a mobile phone
have an agenda...

1822
01:20:22,594 --> 01:20:23,357
and kill people...

1823
01:20:23,457 --> 01:20:24,957
I told her that when
she read the script.

1824
01:20:25,057 --> 01:20:26,557
Yeah. You were the
voice of reason, mate.

1825
01:20:26,657 --> 01:20:28,197
I tried to be, but
she didn't listen.

1826
01:20:28,297 --> 01:20:29,376
Going around killing people.

1827
01:20:29,476 --> 01:20:30,877
A mobile phone,
like, doing murders.

1828
01:20:30,977 --> 01:20:32,242
Why couldn't you just
take the battery...

1829
01:20:32,342 --> 01:20:32,837
out of the phone?

1830
01:20:32,937 --> 01:20:34,237
Right. That's it.
The battle's over.

1831
01:20:34,337 --> 01:20:36,477
- Yeah, we've won.
I hated it.

1832
01:20:36,577 --> 01:20:38,557
Well, it's not for
everyone, but it...

1833
01:20:38,657 --> 01:20:40,557
No, it's ridiculous.
Here's my favourite scene.

1834
01:20:40,657 --> 01:20:42,657
Ring-ring. Hello?

1835
01:20:43,057 --> 01:20:44,717
Right. It would never happen.
- Yeah.

1836
01:20:44,817 --> 01:20:46,077
No, it could never happen.

1837
01:20:46,177 --> 01:20:50,056
It's a metaphor for
addiction to technology.

1838
01:20:50,177 --> 01:20:51,177
For society,

1839
01:20:51,277 --> 01:20:54,077
for how we're reliant
on technology.

1840
01:20:54,177 --> 01:20:55,197
I get it. I'm with you.

1841
01:20:55,297 --> 01:20:56,797
It's a metaphor
for a crap movie.

1842
01:20:56,897 --> 01:20:58,917
Well, it was the right choice
for me at the time.

1843
01:20:59,017 --> 01:21:01,017
Sure.
- You know?

1844
01:21:12,657 --> 01:21:14,657
Well, this is awkward.

1845
01:21:17,937 --> 01:21:19,557
Yeah?

1846
01:21:19,657 --> 01:21:21,957
- It's a bit more awkward now.
A little.

1847
01:21:22,057 --> 01:21:23,057
Hey, excuse me.

1848
01:21:23,157 --> 01:21:24,797
Can we get another
bottle of wine, please?

1849
01:21:24,897 --> 01:21:26,037
- Sure.
- Thank you.

1850
01:21:26,137 --> 01:21:27,117
Mr Snow?

1851
01:21:27,217 --> 01:21:28,168
Can I get cranberry juice...

1852
01:21:28,268 --> 01:21:29,397
with a bit of lime
in it, please.

1853
01:21:29,497 --> 01:21:31,037
Do you want cranberry juice
or cranberry cocktail?

1854
01:21:31,137 --> 01:21:32,803
Because I can probably
rustle up either one.

1855
01:21:32,903 --> 01:21:33,477
Throw some OJ...

1856
01:21:33,577 --> 01:21:35,577
I don't care.

1857
01:21:35,657 --> 01:21:37,657
Okay, great.

1858
01:21:46,048 --> 01:21:49,363
Hey, can we get
another bottle of wine?

1859
01:21:57,408 --> 01:21:58,878
If I've learned anything
from addiction,

1860
01:21:58,978 --> 01:21:59,308
it's that,

1861
01:21:59,408 --> 01:22:01,043
you know, life is as brief...

1862
01:22:01,143 --> 01:22:03,708
as the twinkling of a
star over all too soon.

1863
01:22:03,808 --> 01:22:07,828
So if you're in a situation
where you're with a woman,

1864
01:22:07,928 --> 01:22:08,473
why not do the most
interesting thing...

1865
01:22:08,573 --> 01:22:09,028
that you can do in
that situation?

1866
01:22:09,128 --> 01:22:11,468
And by which, I don't mean
have a conversation,

1867
01:22:11,568 --> 01:22:12,908
have a chin-wag,
a bit of a chat.

1868
01:22:13,008 --> 01:22:14,440
Lose yourself in something...

1869
01:22:14,540 --> 01:22:16,228
that's both ancient
and perennial.

1870
01:22:16,328 --> 01:22:19,168
Find something
eternal, perpetual.

1871
01:22:19,268 --> 01:22:21,268
Lose yourself in fuck.

1872
01:22:22,368 --> 01:22:24,404
I'm going to disagree.

1873
01:22:24,528 --> 01:22:25,868
Respectfully, of course, sir.

1874
01:22:25,968 --> 01:22:27,948
Maybe for you, that works.

1875
01:22:28,048 --> 01:22:29,790
For me, it's much
more enjoyable...

1876
01:22:29,890 --> 01:22:31,068
to get to know somebody.

1877
01:22:31,168 --> 01:22:32,137
If you end up
sleeping with them,

1878
01:22:32,237 --> 01:22:32,588
that's great.

1879
01:22:32,688 --> 01:22:34,748
But I like getting
to know somebody.

1880
01:22:34,848 --> 01:22:36,188
But he...

1881
01:22:36,288 --> 01:22:37,825
What he's saying is that...

1882
01:22:37,925 --> 01:22:40,108
he's gonna stick it
wherever he wants,

1883
01:22:40,208 --> 01:22:42,642
but he's joking.

1884
01:22:42,768 --> 01:22:44,308
I ain't. No, I'm not joking.

1885
01:22:44,408 --> 01:22:47,213
It's just what I
believe, really.

1886
01:22:48,048 --> 01:22:49,468
So...

1887
01:22:49,568 --> 01:22:52,446
Just so we're clear
and so I can hone in...

1888
01:22:52,546 --> 01:22:54,948
on your central
thesis of the night,

1889
01:22:55,048 --> 01:22:56,468
wade through all the bullshit,

1890
01:22:56,568 --> 01:22:57,425
you're telling me...

1891
01:22:57,525 --> 01:22:59,108
that you think you
have the right...

1892
01:22:59,208 --> 01:23:01,748
to just fuck anyone,
anywhere, anytime?

1893
01:23:01,848 --> 01:23:02,816
- Yes. There it
is. That's right.

1894
01:23:02,916 --> 01:23:03,668
That's what you're saying?

1895
01:23:03,768 --> 01:23:04,855
Not so eloquently...

1896
01:23:04,955 --> 01:23:06,668
as you just put
it, sweetheart.

1897
01:23:06,768 --> 01:23:08,028
But ultimately,
yes, that is...

1898
01:23:08,128 --> 01:23:10,128
Oh, no. Not the shirt.

1899
01:23:10,128 --> 01:23:13,273
Take my eyes, but
not the shirt. Mmm.

1900
01:23:13,528 --> 01:23:16,308
Yeah, that's pretty much
what I believe, Sarah.

1901
01:23:16,408 --> 01:23:18,788
When you're done making jokes,
are you gonna get a napkin?

1902
01:23:18,888 --> 01:23:20,251
Do you know what? I
think I've improved it,

1903
01:23:20,351 --> 01:23:21,188
actually, against all odds.

1904
01:23:21,288 --> 01:23:22,508
I think I deserve
a design award.

1905
01:23:22,608 --> 01:23:24,508
Please get some seltzer water.

1906
01:23:24,608 --> 01:23:28,668
- Garçon, could we get some...
- I saw it from farther away.

1907
01:23:28,768 --> 01:23:30,588
- Okay.
- Just lean back for a second.

1908
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:32,308
No, it's all right. It's
not there. Let me...

1909
01:23:32,408 --> 01:23:33,748
You're very diligent.
I appreciate it.

1910
01:23:33,848 --> 01:23:34,557
Let go of the glass now.

1911
01:23:34,657 --> 01:23:35,588
You're gonna have
to walk away.

1912
01:23:35,688 --> 01:23:37,548
Bless you. There you are.

1913
01:23:37,648 --> 01:23:39,648
Oh, me, oh, my.

1914
01:23:40,248 --> 01:23:42,713
- Call the doctor.
- Oh, good.

1915
01:23:51,008 --> 01:23:53,068
- I love Hawaii.
- Is it good?

1916
01:23:53,168 --> 01:23:54,391
Yeah, it's nice,

1917
01:23:54,491 --> 01:23:57,068
but I think for
like a week tops.

1918
01:23:57,168 --> 01:23:58,788
Any more than that,
I know I'd go crazy,

1919
01:23:58,888 --> 01:24:02,508
because I think that
Hawaii is a place to escape...

1920
01:24:02,608 --> 01:24:06,433
for people who can't deal
with the real world.

1921
01:24:07,608 --> 01:24:09,849
Yeah, you know, there's so few...

1922
01:24:09,949 --> 01:24:12,468
personal shoppers
and pet therapists.

1923
01:24:12,568 --> 01:24:14,948
Gosh, it's such a hard life.

1924
01:24:24,488 --> 01:24:26,488
I like living here.

1925
01:24:28,488 --> 01:24:32,653
- Anyone need any more vino?
- I think we're good.

1926
01:24:33,368 --> 01:24:35,068
I've a question for
you real quick, Mr S.

1927
01:24:35,168 --> 01:24:36,582
I was actually
meaning to ask you,

1928
01:24:36,682 --> 01:24:38,268
what did you exactly
think of my demo?

1929
01:24:38,368 --> 01:24:40,588
Did you get it?
Did you get it?

1930
01:24:40,688 --> 01:24:43,348
Oh, no. I was gonna
listen to that,

1931
01:24:43,448 --> 01:24:47,018
but then I just carried
on living my life.

1932
01:24:49,248 --> 01:24:50,388
Not at all?

1933
01:24:50,488 --> 01:24:52,672
No, I didn't,
because, you know.

1934
01:24:52,772 --> 01:24:54,188
I go on my instincts,

1935
01:24:54,288 --> 01:24:56,288
and they weren't good.

1936
01:24:57,568 --> 01:24:58,705
You know what, dude?

1937
01:24:58,805 --> 01:25:01,188
Fuck you, okay? You
can go fuck yourself.

1938
01:25:01,288 --> 01:25:03,108
I can't yell right now
because I'll get fired.

1939
01:25:03,208 --> 01:25:04,188
My boss will hear me,

1940
01:25:04,288 --> 01:25:06,148
and then I won't be able
to pay off my student loans.

1941
01:25:06,248 --> 01:25:07,956
But you know what?
You're an asshole.

1942
01:25:08,056 --> 01:25:08,908
I fucking hate you.

1943
01:25:09,008 --> 01:25:10,068
I bought all your records.

1944
01:25:10,168 --> 01:25:11,537
This whole fucking time,
I've been trying...

1945
01:25:11,637 --> 01:25:12,748
to get you to come
hang out with me.

1946
01:25:12,848 --> 01:25:14,946
I'm gonna have people
fuck with your food...

1947
01:25:15,046 --> 01:25:16,948
the rest of your trip,
you fucking dick.

1948
01:25:17,048 --> 01:25:19,938
I like him. That
was quite moving.

1949
01:25:34,088 --> 01:25:35,348
Wait, wait, wait.

1950
01:25:35,448 --> 01:25:37,913
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1951
01:25:38,128 --> 01:25:40,268
Are you sure that you're not,
like, too drunk?

1952
01:25:40,368 --> 01:25:43,853
Jesus, would you stop
being so sensitive.

1953
01:26:08,148 --> 01:26:10,148
Aldous.

1954
01:26:10,588 --> 01:26:11,888
Wake up.

1955
01:26:11,988 --> 01:26:14,456
- Aldous. Wake up.
- Hmm...

1956
01:26:14,588 --> 01:26:16,588
Make love to me.

1957
01:26:18,428 --> 01:26:21,183
All right. You go
on top, though,

1958
01:26:21,283 --> 01:26:23,283
'cause I'm knackered.

1959
01:26:35,788 --> 01:26:37,788
Listen.

1960
01:26:39,228 --> 01:26:41,228
Yes. Yes.

1961
01:26:43,668 --> 01:26:45,668
- Yeah.
Yes.

1962
01:26:45,668 --> 01:26:47,668
- Oh, yes.
- Yeah.

1963
01:26:49,988 --> 01:26:51,988
- Yeah. Oh, God.
- Yeah.

1964
01:26:56,068 --> 01:26:57,408
- Right there.
- Yes.

1965
01:26:57,508 --> 01:26:59,848
- Yes.
- Yes. She's having an orgasm.

1966
01:26:59,948 --> 01:27:01,728
This is the best sex ever.

1967
01:27:01,828 --> 01:27:04,208
Yeah, all right, that'll do.

1968
01:27:04,268 --> 01:27:06,268
What?

1969
01:27:06,548 --> 01:27:09,778
I made a mistake
coming here with you.

1970
01:27:11,908 --> 01:27:13,948
And I'm not done either.

1971
01:27:14,988 --> 01:27:16,968
- Please shut up. Okay.
- Okay.

1972
01:27:17,068 --> 01:27:18,706
You're still involved
with him next door,

1973
01:27:18,806 --> 01:27:19,168
ain't you?

1974
01:27:19,268 --> 01:27:20,248
Excuse me?

1975
01:27:20,348 --> 01:27:22,048
You should've seen yourself
at dinner, Sarah.

1976
01:27:22,148 --> 01:27:23,624
Then we come back here,

1977
01:27:23,724 --> 01:27:26,328
and you put on that
ghastly performance.

1978
01:27:26,428 --> 01:27:29,248
I mean, I've heard that
women do fake orgasms,

1979
01:27:29,348 --> 01:27:30,768
but I've never seen one.

1980
01:27:30,868 --> 01:27:32,408
It really deeply upset me.

1981
01:27:32,508 --> 01:27:35,443
You should have seen
yourself at dinner.

1982
01:27:35,543 --> 01:27:36,543
'Oh, I'm Aldous

1983
01:27:36,643 --> 01:27:39,563
Snow. Bullshit, bullshit,
bullshit, bullshit.

1984
01:27:39,663 --> 01:27:41,563
'No, no drinks for me, thanks.

1985
01:27:41,663 --> 01:27:43,163
'Bullshit,
bullshit, bullshit.'

1986
01:27:43,263 --> 01:27:45,723
That's a really
reductive impression.

1987
01:27:45,823 --> 01:27:47,039
If I wanted to
see you act badly.

1988
01:27:47,139 --> 01:27:48,163
I'd just watch your TV show,

1989
01:27:48,263 --> 01:27:50,283
which, obviously, I can't now,
because it's been cancelled.

1990
01:27:50,383 --> 01:27:52,323
Oh, my God, you're
such a prick.

1991
01:27:52,423 --> 01:27:53,443
And you know what?

1992
01:27:53,543 --> 01:27:56,443
Let me tell you something
about these tattoos, okay?

1993
01:27:56,543 --> 01:27:58,369
That is Buddhist.
That is Nordic.

1994
01:27:58,469 --> 01:28:00,523
That is Hindu. That's
just gibberish.

1995
01:28:00,623 --> 01:28:02,643
They are completely
conflicting ideologies.

1996
01:28:02,743 --> 01:28:04,883
And that does not make you
a citizen of the world.

1997
01:28:04,983 --> 01:28:07,193
It makes you full of shit.

1998
01:28:10,223 --> 01:28:13,453
Was that genuine or
did you fake that?

1999
01:28:14,623 --> 01:28:18,616
Right. I'm gonna
probably clear off now.

2000
01:28:18,743 --> 01:28:20,163
I'll have a little
sleep for a few hours,

2001
01:28:20,263 --> 01:28:24,258
then I'm gonna probably go
in the morning, okay?

2002
01:28:28,543 --> 01:28:30,543
I hate your music.

2003
01:28:30,663 --> 01:28:31,663
Yeah, well,

2004
01:28:31,763 --> 01:28:35,078
I fucked the housekeeper
the other day.

2005
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:41,936
Are you sleeping?

2006
01:28:42,336 --> 01:28:44,336
Not any more.

2007
01:28:49,056 --> 01:28:52,746
I know that I'm leaving
in a couple of days,

2008
01:28:52,846 --> 01:28:54,846
so I don't even know...

2009
01:28:54,936 --> 01:28:57,061
what the hell this means,

2010
01:29:00,256 --> 01:29:04,251
but I really like spending
time with you a lot.

2011
01:29:06,336 --> 01:29:08,336
I know. Me too.

2012
01:29:16,416 --> 01:29:18,416
Hey.

2013
01:29:23,296 --> 01:29:25,296
Good morning.

2014
01:29:27,456 --> 01:29:28,676
Where are you going?

2015
01:29:28,776 --> 01:29:32,044
The Korean Textile
Manufacturer's Luau.

2016
01:29:32,144 --> 01:29:34,246
- Just kill me.
- Fun.

2017
01:29:34,376 --> 01:29:36,376
Joy.

2018
01:29:37,216 --> 01:29:38,857
I want you to know...

2019
01:29:38,957 --> 01:29:41,932
that I meant what
I said last night.

2020
01:29:41,976 --> 01:29:43,976
I know you did.

2021
01:29:44,656 --> 01:29:46,656
I did, too.

2022
01:29:48,496 --> 01:29:51,641
- Can I see you again tonight?
- Yeah.

2023
01:29:52,176 --> 01:29:54,386
- I get off at 7:00.
- Yay.

2024
01:29:54,856 --> 01:29:56,856
Bye.

2025
01:29:58,794 --> 01:30:00,054
Sir, morning mai tai.

2026
01:30:00,154 --> 01:30:01,894
You know what?

2027
01:30:01,994 --> 01:30:04,542
I actually will not be having...

2028
01:30:04,642 --> 01:30:07,617
an alcoholic beverage
this morning.

2029
01:30:32,234 --> 01:30:35,549
Jump. Jump. Jump.
- Don't make me do it.

2030
01:30:52,954 --> 01:30:54,954
Hey. Morning, mate.

2031
01:30:55,594 --> 01:30:56,831
- How are you today?

2032
01:30:56,931 --> 01:30:59,134
Yeah, I'm good.
I'm good. You okay?

2033
01:30:59,234 --> 01:31:01,254
Am I okay? I'm better
than okay, my friend.

2034
01:31:01,354 --> 01:31:02,774
You seem sprightly.

2035
01:31:02,874 --> 01:31:04,614
I...

2036
01:31:04,714 --> 01:31:06,254
I had a great time last night.

2037
01:31:06,354 --> 01:31:08,394
- Congratulations.
Well done. Well done.

2038
01:31:08,494 --> 01:31:09,494
Thank you.

2039
01:31:09,594 --> 01:31:11,294
What about you?
What's with the bag?

2040
01:31:11,394 --> 01:31:14,654
Right, yeah. I'm off
back to England, mate.

2041
01:31:14,754 --> 01:31:16,014
Oh, you and Sarah
are going to England.

2042
01:31:16,114 --> 01:31:18,919
No, no, no. I'm
just going alone.

2043
01:31:19,234 --> 01:31:19,449
- Yeah.

2044
01:31:19,549 --> 01:31:20,974
Did you guys have a
fight or something?

2045
01:31:21,074 --> 01:31:22,848
Yeah, it was really...
How you served...

2046
01:31:22,948 --> 01:31:24,494
five years under
her, I don't know.

2047
01:31:24,594 --> 01:31:26,754
You deserve a medal
or a holiday...

2048
01:31:26,854 --> 01:31:29,014
or at least a cuddle
from somebody.

2049
01:31:29,114 --> 01:31:30,694
You were only here for a week.

2050
01:31:30,794 --> 01:31:32,814
Well, I don't know.
For me, that one week of it...

2051
01:31:32,914 --> 01:31:34,891
was like going
on holiday with.

2052
01:31:34,991 --> 01:31:37,294
I don't know, I
wouldn't say Hitler,

2053
01:31:37,394 --> 01:31:38,516
but certainly Goebbels.

2054
01:31:38,616 --> 01:31:40,654
It was like a little
holiday with Hitler.

2055
01:31:40,754 --> 01:31:42,014
Jesus.

2056
01:31:42,114 --> 01:31:44,099
Hey, listen, at least
it's clear now...

2057
01:31:44,199 --> 01:31:45,454
for you two to reconnect.

2058
01:31:45,554 --> 01:31:47,554
Oh...

2059
01:31:47,954 --> 01:31:49,990
No, no. No.

2060
01:31:50,114 --> 01:31:50,629
You know what?

2061
01:31:50,729 --> 01:31:52,334
I have a good thing
going on with Rachel,

2062
01:31:52,434 --> 01:31:54,054
and I want to
see that through.

2063
01:31:54,154 --> 01:31:56,314
Well, maybe you could
have both of them.

2064
01:31:56,414 --> 01:31:57,414
Rachel and Sarah.

2065
01:31:57,514 --> 01:31:59,154
They got on all right,
didn't they, at dinner?

2066
01:31:59,254 --> 01:32:00,254
So maybe...

2067
01:32:00,354 --> 01:32:00,890
You know what?

2068
01:32:00,990 --> 01:32:02,574
First of all, I'm
not that kind of guy.

2069
01:32:02,674 --> 01:32:04,898
And even if I was, I
don't think that I have...

2070
01:32:04,998 --> 01:32:07,174
the sexual competency to
really pull that off.

2071
01:32:07,274 --> 01:32:08,774
Yeah. It's a gift.

2072
01:32:08,874 --> 01:32:09,874
I will say,

2073
01:32:09,974 --> 01:32:11,934
if you do get back
with Miss Marshall,

2074
01:32:12,034 --> 01:32:15,264
handle with care,
because, you know...

2075
01:32:16,354 --> 01:32:17,934
Okay. Well, I think
my ride's here.

2076
01:32:18,034 --> 01:32:19,156
So I'm gonna skedaddle then...

2077
01:32:19,256 --> 01:32:20,574
before anything
else happens to me.

2078
01:32:20,674 --> 01:32:22,254
Before life gets
any more daft.

2079
01:32:22,354 --> 01:32:23,814
Is someone gonna take that?

2080
01:32:23,914 --> 01:32:27,144
Listen, don't let
them grind you down.

2081
01:32:27,594 --> 01:32:28,814
Take it easy.

2082
01:32:28,914 --> 01:32:33,249
Hey, look at my driver.
I'm gonna have sex with her.

2083
01:32:35,782 --> 01:32:39,097
He said it was clear
I wasn't over you.

2084
01:32:40,782 --> 01:32:42,482
And then he left.

2085
01:32:42,582 --> 01:32:44,582
Fucking prick.

2086
01:32:45,902 --> 01:32:49,042
And then I started thinking,
what if he's right?

2087
01:32:49,142 --> 01:32:51,895
What if I'm not over you?

2088
01:32:53,742 --> 01:32:54,742
- Sarah...

2089
01:32:54,842 --> 01:32:57,562
Please just let
me finish, Pete.

2090
01:33:03,262 --> 01:33:04,572
What if I made...

2091
01:33:04,672 --> 01:33:07,562
a really, really
horrible mistake?

2092
01:33:09,102 --> 01:33:10,962
- Sarah.
- Yeah?

2093
01:33:11,062 --> 01:33:13,098
- Sarah.
- Yeah?

2094
01:33:13,222 --> 01:33:15,562
Stop pulling my face
towards your face.

2095
01:33:15,662 --> 01:33:17,322
Why?

2096
01:33:17,422 --> 01:33:18,922
You don't like it?

2097
01:33:19,022 --> 01:33:21,162
Listen, pulling my
shirt towards you...

2098
01:33:21,262 --> 01:33:23,402
is the same concept
as pulling my face.

2099
01:33:23,502 --> 01:33:25,671
Let's spend one more
night here together,

2100
01:33:25,771 --> 01:33:27,562
and then let's go
home and then...

2101
01:33:27,662 --> 01:33:29,442
And we'll just pretend
like it never happened.

2102
01:33:29,542 --> 01:33:31,482
...face reality. No.
- That's the big plan?

2103
01:33:31,582 --> 01:33:33,242
No. I love you.

2104
01:33:33,342 --> 01:33:34,652
That's not fair.

2105
01:33:34,752 --> 01:33:38,196
That's not fair of
you to say that to me.

2106
01:33:38,296 --> 01:33:40,296
Please, Peter.

2107
01:33:42,462 --> 01:33:45,692
- Tell me you're sorry.
- I'm so sorry.

2108
01:33:48,062 --> 01:33:50,062
I missed you.

2109
01:33:54,582 --> 01:33:56,582
I'm sorry.

2110
01:33:58,542 --> 01:34:00,667
God, I missed you, Peter.

2111
01:34:07,382 --> 01:34:08,882
All right.

2112
01:34:08,982 --> 01:34:12,250
Get hard for me,
Pete. Get hard for me.

2113
01:34:12,350 --> 01:34:13,782
- I know what I'm
supposed to do.

2114
01:34:13,882 --> 01:34:14,882
Okay.

2115
01:34:14,982 --> 01:34:16,842
Just do it. Come on. Get hard.

2116
01:34:16,942 --> 01:34:18,522
- I'm trying.
- Okay.

2117
01:34:18,622 --> 01:34:21,302
- Here. Just let me
do it for a second.

2118
01:34:21,402 --> 01:34:22,402
Okay.

2119
01:34:22,502 --> 01:34:25,562
I really want you,
Peter. I missed you.

2120
01:34:25,662 --> 01:34:26,962
You don't want help?

2121
01:34:27,062 --> 01:34:28,480
- You don't want help? Uh-huh.

2122
01:34:28,580 --> 01:34:30,242
Can you be quiet
just for a minute?

2123
01:34:30,342 --> 01:34:31,322
Do you want my hands?

2124
01:34:31,422 --> 01:34:34,336
Maybe just don't
talk for a second...

2125
01:34:34,436 --> 01:34:35,555
is what I mean.

2126
01:34:35,655 --> 01:34:37,002
Do you want my mouth?

2127
01:34:37,102 --> 01:34:40,332
- Yeah, maybe your mouth.
- Yeah. Okay.

2128
01:34:47,702 --> 01:34:50,136
What's the problem, Peter?

2129
01:34:50,262 --> 01:34:52,302
- I don't know...
- More?

2130
01:34:52,342 --> 01:34:55,062
You can keep trying
if you want.

2131
01:34:58,862 --> 01:35:00,862
What's wrong with you?

2132
01:35:00,862 --> 01:35:02,531
- Nothing is wrong
with me, okay?

2133
01:35:02,631 --> 01:35:02,842
Okay.

2134
01:35:02,942 --> 01:35:03,422
- No, I didn't...

2135
01:35:03,522 --> 01:35:04,842
Just, something doesn't
feel right any more.

2136
01:35:04,942 --> 01:35:06,682
Okay. Well, did
you... You know what?

2137
01:35:06,782 --> 01:35:07,481
Did you drink today?

2138
01:35:07,581 --> 01:35:08,842
Because sometimes
when you drink...

2139
01:35:08,942 --> 01:35:10,282
Excuse me.

2140
01:35:10,382 --> 01:35:13,952
No, I haven't had
anything to drink today.

2141
01:35:15,422 --> 01:35:17,166
Maybe the problem is that...

2142
01:35:17,266 --> 01:35:19,842
you broke my heart
into a million pieces,

2143
01:35:19,942 --> 01:35:21,566
and so my cock doesn't want...

2144
01:35:21,666 --> 01:35:23,402
to be around you
any more, okay?

2145
01:35:23,502 --> 01:35:25,502
Ever.

2146
01:35:26,542 --> 01:35:27,862
Because you know what
I just realised?

2147
01:35:27,962 --> 01:35:28,962
Huh?

2148
01:35:29,062 --> 01:35:31,782
You're the God
damn devil. Okay?

2149
01:35:36,262 --> 01:35:39,067
Wedding in Hawaii.
Real original.

2150
01:35:49,542 --> 01:35:51,658
- Hey.
- Hey, Rachel.

2151
01:35:52,982 --> 01:35:54,782
- Sarah and Aldous
broke up this morning.

2152
01:35:54,882 --> 01:35:55,882
What a surprise.

2153
01:35:55,982 --> 01:35:58,957
So I went to check
on Sarah, and...

2154
01:36:01,342 --> 01:36:02,008
Listen, I'm here...

2155
01:36:02,108 --> 01:36:03,602
because I don't want
to lie to you, okay?

2156
01:36:03,702 --> 01:36:05,482
Some stuff happened.

2157
01:36:05,582 --> 01:36:07,402
I'm really, really
sorry that it did,

2158
01:36:07,502 --> 01:36:10,282
but I'm also really glad
that it did, because

2159
01:36:10,382 --> 01:36:12,663
I'm able to see so clearly now...

2160
01:36:12,763 --> 01:36:15,962
that Sarah and I are not
right for each other.

2161
01:36:16,062 --> 01:36:18,062
What stuff?

2162
01:36:19,502 --> 01:36:23,240
I went up to make sure
that she was okay,

2163
01:36:23,340 --> 01:36:24,882
and it got weird.

2164
01:36:24,982 --> 01:36:26,722
But now everything is fine.

2165
01:36:26,822 --> 01:36:28,282
And I need you
to understand...

2166
01:36:28,382 --> 01:36:29,708
that I meant everything
that I said...

2167
01:36:29,808 --> 01:36:30,482
to you this morning.

2168
01:36:30,582 --> 01:36:31,762
What exactly happened, Peter?

2169
01:36:31,862 --> 01:36:33,322
We fooled around a little bit.

2170
01:36:33,422 --> 01:36:34,817
Shut the fuck up,

2171
01:36:34,917 --> 01:36:37,722
and tell me exactly
what you did.

2172
01:36:38,142 --> 01:36:40,484
All right. I went to her room,

2173
01:36:40,584 --> 01:36:43,802
and she was crying
and crying and crying.

2174
01:36:43,902 --> 01:36:45,962
And I felt like I
should comfort her.

2175
01:36:46,062 --> 01:36:47,728
And then she started
kissing me...

2176
01:36:47,828 --> 01:36:49,242
because I was comforting her.

2177
01:36:49,342 --> 01:36:50,471
And then the next
thing I knew.

2178
01:36:50,571 --> 01:36:51,282
I was kissing her...

2179
01:36:51,382 --> 01:36:52,477
because she had
been kissing me...

2180
01:36:52,577 --> 01:36:53,402
because of the comforting.

2181
01:36:53,502 --> 01:36:56,767
Then she started
taking my clothes off,

2182
01:36:56,867 --> 01:36:59,417
and then her clothes were off.

2183
01:37:00,262 --> 01:37:01,555
Then she performed...

2184
01:37:01,655 --> 01:37:03,842
10 to 15 seconds
of oral sex on me.

2185
01:37:03,942 --> 01:37:05,282
Okay. Peter, you
can leave now.

2186
01:37:05,382 --> 01:37:06,322
- At the most. Maximum.

2187
01:37:06,422 --> 01:37:07,922
Thank you for staying
at Turtle Bay.

2188
01:37:08,022 --> 01:37:09,082
Rachel, please don't do this.

2189
01:37:09,182 --> 01:37:10,378
The only reason I'm
telling you this...

2190
01:37:10,478 --> 01:37:11,482
is because I really
care about...

2191
01:37:11,582 --> 01:37:13,582
Listen to me, Peter.

2192
01:37:13,622 --> 01:37:16,522
I was a mess, too.
I understand. Okay?

2193
01:37:16,622 --> 01:37:17,864
But it does not excuse...

2194
01:37:17,964 --> 01:37:19,722
you acting like a
complete asshole.

2195
01:37:19,822 --> 01:37:20,748
Listen, I know that

2196
01:37:20,848 --> 01:37:22,442
I fucked things
up for a minute,

2197
01:37:22,542 --> 01:37:24,042
but I'm not like
every other asshole.

2198
01:37:24,142 --> 01:37:27,595
You should not be with
anybody right now.

2199
01:37:27,695 --> 01:37:29,695
Anybody.

2200
01:37:30,662 --> 01:37:32,442
I know...

2201
01:37:32,542 --> 01:37:34,042
I know that there
is something here.

2202
01:37:34,142 --> 01:37:35,882
I know that I was
not wrong about that.

2203
01:37:35,982 --> 01:37:38,907
And, yes, it's only
been four days,

2204
01:37:39,007 --> 01:37:41,387
but I know you feel it, too.

2205
01:37:44,222 --> 01:37:46,222
I need you to leave.

2206
01:37:47,902 --> 01:37:50,572
Do not write me.
Do not call me.

2207
01:37:50,672 --> 01:37:52,672
Do not e-mail me.

2208
01:37:57,222 --> 01:37:59,262
Peter, I need you to go.

2209
01:38:03,502 --> 01:38:05,882
I won't bother you any more.

2210
01:38:06,502 --> 01:38:08,502
I'm sorry.

2211
01:38:14,902 --> 01:38:16,942
I don't know what to do.

2212
01:38:24,382 --> 01:38:25,528
Hey, brother, what
you doing, huh?

2213
01:38:25,628 --> 01:38:26,282
You stealing my art?

2214
01:38:26,382 --> 01:38:27,949
I want you to put
it back right now.

2215
01:38:28,049 --> 01:38:28,762
Put it back, bro.

2216
01:38:28,862 --> 01:38:31,242
Listen, give me the picture.

2217
01:38:31,302 --> 01:38:33,562
Doo-doo paper.
You're throwing doo-doo paper?

2218
01:38:33,662 --> 01:38:35,662
Give me the picture.

2219
01:38:37,902 --> 01:38:41,042
Don't be stupid, brother.
Just give me the picture.

2220
01:38:41,142 --> 01:38:42,568
You can hit me as many
times as you want.

2221
01:38:42,668 --> 01:38:43,842
I'm not giving you
the photo back.

2222
01:38:43,942 --> 01:38:45,942
Oh, yeah.

2223
01:38:51,462 --> 01:38:52,462
No, no, no.

2224
01:38:52,562 --> 01:38:56,302
Peter, I told you I did
not want to see you.

2225
01:39:13,422 --> 01:39:14,931
Aloha, I'm Sarah Marshall...

2226
01:39:15,031 --> 01:39:17,042
from Crime Scene:
Scene of the Crime.

2227
01:39:17,142 --> 01:39:18,602
And when I'm not
scrubbing for evidence.

2228
01:39:18,702 --> 01:39:22,082
I'm flying Hawaiian Airlines
to my favourite destinations.

2229
01:39:22,182 --> 01:39:22,782
Now sit back...

2230
01:39:22,882 --> 01:39:24,522
and enjoy your
in-flight entertainment.

2231
01:39:24,622 --> 01:39:26,747
I know I will. Mahalo....

2232
01:39:26,982 --> 01:39:30,133
Everybody hates you

2233
01:39:30,262 --> 01:39:33,459
Everybody wishes
that you were dead

2234
01:39:33,582 --> 01:39:35,122
Because, Peter, you suck

2235
01:39:35,222 --> 01:39:37,002
Peter, you suck

2236
01:39:37,102 --> 01:39:40,245
Peter, your music
is fucking terrible

2237
01:39:40,345 --> 01:39:41,842
Peter, you suck

2238
01:39:41,942 --> 01:39:43,402
Peter, you suck

2239
01:39:43,502 --> 01:39:46,625
Peter, you don't do
anything of value

2240
01:39:46,725 --> 01:39:48,122
Peter, you suck

2241
01:39:48,222 --> 01:39:50,068
Write some music but instead...

2242
01:39:50,168 --> 01:39:52,442
you sit and write
these bullshit songs

2243
01:39:52,542 --> 01:39:54,122
It's so self-loathing

2244
01:39:54,222 --> 01:39:57,322
Go see a psychiatrist
I hate the psychiatrist

2245
01:39:57,422 --> 01:39:58,802
Well, go see one anyway

2246
01:39:58,902 --> 01:40:00,202
I don't like the psychiatrist

2247
01:40:00,302 --> 01:40:01,842
You need to go and see one

2248
01:40:01,942 --> 01:40:03,362
See a psychiatrist

2249
01:40:03,462 --> 01:40:05,462
I'm not going

2250
01:40:39,102 --> 01:40:42,223
It's getting kind of
hard to believe...

2251
01:40:42,323 --> 01:40:44,873
things are going to get better

2252
01:41:29,422 --> 01:41:30,962
I don't understand
what there is to think about.

2253
01:41:31,062 --> 01:41:32,122
Because, D, he...

2254
01:41:32,222 --> 01:41:34,602
She licked the tip.
That doesn't count.

2255
01:41:34,702 --> 01:41:37,322
- Of course it counts. He...
- He what?

2256
01:41:37,422 --> 01:41:38,712
He refused a blowjob...

2257
01:41:38,812 --> 01:41:40,802
from his ex-girlfriend
mid-blowjob.

2258
01:41:40,902 --> 01:41:42,401
Do you know what
that's like for a man?

2259
01:41:42,501 --> 01:41:43,682
It's called blue
balls, Rachel.

2260
01:41:43,782 --> 01:41:45,802
This guy is like
Gandhi, but better.

2261
01:41:45,902 --> 01:41:46,882
He likes puppets.

2262
01:41:46,982 --> 01:41:48,982
I love puppets.

2263
01:41:49,662 --> 01:41:51,634
I love Fraggle Rock.
I love Lamb Chop.

2264
01:41:51,734 --> 01:41:52,322
I love Elmo.

2265
01:41:52,422 --> 01:41:54,922
Sesame Street, Bert and Ernie,

2266
01:41:55,022 --> 01:41:57,997
Snuffelupagus.
Fucks my shit up....

2267
01:41:59,782 --> 01:42:03,202
This is a song that
I never thought I would write

2268
01:42:03,302 --> 01:42:05,302
On the night I'm dying

2269
01:42:05,422 --> 01:42:08,334
Sorry for all the
wrong I've done

2270
01:42:08,462 --> 01:42:10,162
I'm finished trying

2271
01:42:10,262 --> 01:42:15,097
It was a wonderful dream
Now let him come and slay me

2272
01:42:15,222 --> 01:42:16,682
There he is

2273
01:42:16,782 --> 01:42:17,420
The demon...

2274
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:19,362
who haunted the
streets of London

2275
01:42:19,462 --> 01:42:20,922
I've come to slay you

2276
01:42:21,022 --> 01:42:22,482
Here I am.

2277
01:42:22,582 --> 01:42:24,962
I'll leave you
bleeding in my dungeon

2278
01:42:25,062 --> 01:42:28,602
I'll never obey you
I'll rip out your oesophagus

2279
01:42:28,702 --> 01:42:33,298
Please, Mr Van Helsing
Listen to me

2280
01:42:33,422 --> 01:42:38,576
He is just a man who
wishes to be free

2281
01:42:38,702 --> 01:42:41,722
Lay him in a hearse
You must end this curse

2282
01:42:41,822 --> 01:42:43,822
He is the worst.

2283
01:42:55,582 --> 01:42:58,733
Don't go my love

2284
01:42:58,862 --> 01:43:02,616
I can't say goodbye

2285
01:43:02,742 --> 01:43:06,257
My reign is done

2286
01:43:06,382 --> 01:43:11,410
It's time to die

2287
01:43:12,302 --> 01:43:13,882
I'm pregnant

2288
01:43:13,982 --> 01:43:15,602
Dracula

2289
01:43:15,702 --> 01:43:16,842
VAN HELSING: What have I done?

2290
01:43:16,942 --> 01:43:19,012
Has flown above

2291
01:43:19,142 --> 01:43:20,362
Who killed Dracula?

2292
01:43:20,462 --> 01:43:23,693
But he found a taste

2293
01:43:23,822 --> 01:43:26,620
A taste for love

2294
01:43:26,742 --> 01:43:29,176
My life is a lie

2295
01:43:29,302 --> 01:43:34,695
Sweet Dracula
I miss my young dead prince

2296
01:43:34,822 --> 01:43:38,781
I'll never see him again

2297
01:43:38,902 --> 01:43:41,211
Until my death

2298
01:43:41,342 --> 01:43:44,414
What a wonderful dream

2299
01:43:44,542 --> 01:43:49,775
To find a taste for love

2300
01:43:49,902 --> 01:43:55,977
A taste for love

2301
01:44:23,742 --> 01:44:27,530
Wow. You came.
I can't believe that you came.

2302
01:44:28,582 --> 01:44:30,402
Peter, this is great.

2303
01:44:30,502 --> 01:44:33,482
- It was really funny. Yeah.
- Thank you.

2304
01:44:33,582 --> 01:44:33,947
You know what?

2305
01:44:34,047 --> 01:44:35,122
I didn't realise that
it was a comedy,

2306
01:44:35,222 --> 01:44:37,722
and then someone told me that,

2307
01:44:37,822 --> 01:44:41,614
and it just, like, opened
the whole thing up.

2308
01:44:41,714 --> 01:44:43,702
- How long are
you in town for?

2309
01:44:43,802 --> 01:44:44,802
Open-ended.

2310
01:44:44,902 --> 01:44:45,882
- Bold.
- Yeah.

2311
01:44:45,982 --> 01:44:49,842
Yeah, you know, I'm kind of
checking out some schools.

2312
01:44:49,942 --> 01:44:52,662
- Congratulations.
- Yeah, maybe.

2313
01:44:55,542 --> 01:44:57,542
You never called.

2314
01:44:58,342 --> 01:45:01,539
You told me not
to. And I listened.

2315
01:45:02,662 --> 01:45:04,698
- Right.
- Wasn't easy.

2316
01:45:04,822 --> 01:45:07,162
I might have called
once and hung up.

2317
01:45:07,262 --> 01:45:10,067
- No. No.
- From a private number.

2318
01:45:10,462 --> 01:45:12,162
No.

2319
01:45:12,262 --> 01:45:13,242
Maybe.

2320
01:45:13,342 --> 01:45:15,458
Peter.
Nice job, Bretter.

2321
01:45:15,582 --> 01:45:16,682
Well, you should
probably go back.

2322
01:45:16,782 --> 01:45:18,842
Would you like to hang out
while you're here?

2323
01:45:18,942 --> 01:45:20,905
- Maybe we could
go to dinner or...

2324
01:45:21,005 --> 01:45:21,242
Yeah.

2325
01:45:21,342 --> 01:45:23,482
- Still have my number?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'll call you.

2326
01:45:23,582 --> 01:45:26,132
- Go.
- Yeah, I should do that.

2327
01:45:26,222 --> 01:45:28,222
Yeah, yeah. Go mingle.

2328
01:45:31,982 --> 01:45:33,162
Hey, Peter.
Hey, Bretter.

2329
01:45:33,262 --> 01:45:34,802
Come over here
and meet my mom.

2330
01:45:34,902 --> 01:45:37,416
- Go, go.
- Off I go.

2331
01:45:37,542 --> 01:45:39,082
- Hey, Peter.
- Nice job, Bretter.

2332
01:45:39,182 --> 01:45:41,042
The play was sick,
man. Good work.

2333
01:45:41,142 --> 01:45:41,619
- Nice job.

2334
01:45:41,719 --> 01:45:43,202
Good job, man.
That was awesome.

2335
01:45:43,302 --> 01:45:44,362
So cool.

2336
01:45:44,462 --> 01:45:46,322
Peter, congratulations.

2337
01:45:46,422 --> 01:45:47,996
I just wanted to
say thank you.

2338
01:45:48,096 --> 01:45:49,722
I had such a great
time tonight.

2339
01:45:49,822 --> 01:45:50,661
Oh, good. You know what?

2340
01:45:50,761 --> 01:45:52,082
I'm gonna change
out of this unitard,

2341
01:45:52,182 --> 01:45:53,428
- 'cause I'm getting
a chafe. Okay.

2342
01:45:53,528 --> 01:45:53,922
Enough said.

2343
01:45:54,022 --> 01:45:56,572
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

2344
01:46:20,942 --> 01:46:22,942
Hey, Peter?

2345
01:46:25,262 --> 01:46:28,493
I was just calling you.

2346
01:46:33,662 --> 01:46:35,698
- Wow.
- Oh, Peter.

2347
01:46:36,542 --> 01:46:39,340
- I'm sorry.
- Stop laughing.

2348
01:46:40,382 --> 01:46:42,847
Can you please stop laughing?

2349
01:46:44,582 --> 01:46:46,582
I missed you.

2350
01:46:47,022 --> 01:46:48,042
I just...

2351
01:46:48,142 --> 01:46:51,627
You know, I actually
wanted to tell you...

2352
01:46:51,631 --> 01:46:55,031
that I've been thinking
so much about...

2353
01:47:40,982 --> 01:47:43,622
NARRATOR: This fall,
Sarah Marshall is back...

2354
01:47:43,722 --> 01:47:44,842
in a brand-new role.

2355
01:47:44,942 --> 01:47:48,562
Your wife had no enemies
that you're aware of.

2356
01:47:48,662 --> 01:47:50,325
Get ready for the
most daring show...

2357
01:47:50,425 --> 01:47:51,162
on television....

2358
01:47:51,262 --> 01:47:53,342
- Just came home, and
she was lying there.

2359
01:47:53,442 --> 01:47:54,442
Right.

2360
01:47:54,542 --> 01:47:55,542
In a world...

2361
01:47:55,642 --> 01:47:58,532
where you don't
know who to trust.

2362
01:48:01,022 --> 01:48:03,741
Charlie, who's Franco Marconi?

2363
01:48:03,862 --> 01:48:04,862
- No. No.

2364
01:48:04,962 --> 01:48:06,802
Gun, gun, gun, gun.
Drop it, drop it.

2365
01:48:06,902 --> 01:48:08,962
Go with your animal instincts.

2366
01:48:13,062 --> 01:48:16,887
- How did you know?
- She's an animal psychic.

2367
01:48:17,222 --> 01:48:20,877
Sarah Marshall returns
on Animal Instincts.

2368
01:48:21,142 --> 01:48:22,282
Life's a bitch.

2369
01:48:22,382 --> 01:48:26,887
And where you're going,
that's exactly what you'll be.
