- You sound like a duck.

- After tonight?
- Correct. I got all tonight to quack.

- Oh, yes!

- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

14

I mean, the way it is now,

15
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:15,492
you're takin' the same risk
as when you rob a bank.

16

Takin' more of a risk.
Banks are easier.

17

Federal banks ain't supposed to stop you
in any way during a robbery.

18
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:24,647
They're insured. Why should they give a
fuck? I don't even need a gun in a Federal bank.

19
00:01:24,711 --> 00:01:28,063
Heard about this one bloke, he walks
into a bank with a portable phone.

20
00:01:28,061 --> 00:01:31,019
He gives the phone to a teller.
The bloke on the other end says,

21
00:01:31,017 --> 00:01:34,508
"We got this guy's little girl. If you don't
give him all your money, we're gonna kill her."

- Fuckin' right it worked. That's what I'm talkin' about.

- Cleans the place out. They don't lift a fuckin' finger.
- Did they hurt the little girl?

25
00:01:47,367 --> 00:01:51,057
There probably never was a little girl.
The point of the story isn't a little girl.

26
00:01:51,054 --> 00:01:53,945
The point of the story is they
robbed a bank with a telephone.

- I'm not saying I wanna rob banks.

-No more liquor stores?
-What've we been talkin' about? Yeah, no more liquor stores.

30
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:06,289
Besides, it ain't the giggle it used to be.
There's too many foreigners own liquor stores.

make us kill him. - I'm not gonna kill anybody.

put us in a situation where it's us or them.

when he'd done his duty,
he went home to your great-grandmother,

took the watch off, put it in an old
coffee can, and in that can it stayed...

about leaving that island alive,

so three days before the Japanese
took the island,

969
01:03:51,163 --> 01:03:56,188
your granddad asked a gunner on
an Air Force transport, name of Winocki-

when he was shot down over Hanoi.

He was captured,
put in a Vietnamese prison camp.

979
01:04:35,174 --> 01:04:39,073
He knew if the gooks
ever saw the watch,

980
01:04:39,142 --> 01:04:42,528
it'd be confiscated,
taken away.

981
01:04:42,599 --> 01:04:46,149
The way your dad looked at it,
this watch was your birthright.

982
01:04:46,147 --> 01:04:50,059
He'd be damned if any slope's gonna put their
greasy, yellow hands on his boy's birthright,

983
01:04:50,056 --> 01:04:53,836
so he hid it in one place he knew
he could hide something- his ass.

Five long years
he wore this watch up his ass.

I didn't mean to shoot
the son of a bitch. The gun went off.

1642

Look at this fuckin' mess! We're on
a city street in broad daylight here!

- Well, believe it now, motherfucker!

1644

We gotta get this car off the road. Cops
notice shit like a car drenched in blood.

1645

- Just take it to a friendly place,
that's all! - This is the Valley, Vincent.

1646
01:51:54,678 --> 01:51:57,080
Marsellus ain't got
no friendly places in the Valley.

my fuckin' town, man! - Shit!

- I'm calling my partner in Toluca Lake.

-Where's Toluca Lake?
-Over the hill here, by Burbank Studios.

I don't know what the fuck we gonna do,

1651
01:52:09,177 --> 01:52:11,995
'cause I ain't got
no other partners in 818.

1652
01:52:12,057 --> 01:52:14,890
Jimmie, how you doin', man?
It's Jules. Just listen up, man.

1653
01:52:14,938 --> 01:52:18,718
Me and my homeboy are in a car, and we
gotta get it off the road, pronto.

1654
01:52:18,779 --> 01:52:20,886
I need to use your garage
for a couple hours.

1655
01:52:20,885 --> 01:52:25,217
We gotta be real fuckin' delicate
with this Jimmie situation.

1656
01:52:25,214 --> 01:52:28,697
He's one remark away
from kickin' our asses out the door.

1657
01:52:28,694 --> 01:52:31,648
- If he does, what do we do?
- We ain't leavin' 'til we make a couple calls,

1658
01:52:31,646 --> 01:52:34,464
but I don't want it to reach
that pitch- Jimmie's a friend.

1659
01:52:34,462 --> 01:52:37,409
You don't come into your friend's house
and start tellin' him what's what.

1660
01:52:37,407 --> 01:52:39,264
Just tell him
not to be abusive.

1661
01:52:39,263 --> 01:52:41,249
He kinda freaked out back there
when he saw Marvin.

1662
01:52:41,248 --> 01:52:44,355
Put yourself in his position-
It's 8:00 in the morning, he just woke up.

1663
01:52:44,353 --> 01:52:46,209
He wasn't expectin' this shit.

1664
01:52:46,273 --> 01:52:49,091
We gotta remember here
who's doin' who a favor.

1665
01:52:49,089 --> 01:52:52,998
If that favor means I gotta take shit,
he can stick that favor straight up his ass.

1666
01:52:52,995 --> 01:52:56,839
- Fuck, nigger, what the fuck'd you just
do to his towel, man? - I was dryin' my hands!

1667
01:52:56,836 --> 01:52:59,718
- You're supposed to wash 'em first!
- You watched me wash 'em.

1668
01:52:59,716 --> 01:53:03,136
- I watched you get 'em wet.
- I was washin' 'em. This shit's hard to get off.

1669
01:53:03,133 --> 01:53:05,126
Maybe if he'd had Lava
I coulda done a better job.

1670
01:53:05,125 --> 01:53:06,982
I used the same
fuckin' soap you did,

1671
01:53:06,981 --> 01:53:09,928
and when I finished, the towel
didn't look like no goddamn maxi-pad!

1672
01:53:09,926 --> 01:53:12,744
What if he was to come in here
and see his towel like this?

1673
01:53:12,807 --> 01:53:16,740
It's shit like this that's gonna bring
this situation to a head, man!

Look, I ain't threatenin' you
or nothin', all right?

You know I respect you and all. But just
don't put me in this position, all right?

1676
01:53:24,521 --> 01:53:27,109
All right.
Fine. Fine.

Ask me nice like that,
no problem.

Go ahead. I don't care.

This some serious
gourmet shit.

would've been satisfied...

- Knock it off, Julie.

1686
01:53:50,159 --> 01:53:54,026
- What?
- I don't need you to tell me how fuckin' good my coffee is.

1687
01:53:54,096 --> 01:53:56,489
I'm the one who buys it.
I know how good it is.

1688
01:53:56,487 --> 01:53:58,483
When Bonnie goes shopping,
she buys shit.

1689
01:53:58,482 --> 01:54:02,005
I buy the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause
when I drink it, I wanna taste it.

1690
01:54:02,032 --> 01:54:05,812
But you know what's on my mind right
now? It ain't the coffee in my kitchen.

1691
01:54:05,874 --> 01:54:07,950
It's the dead nigger
in my garage.

1692

- Jimmie, don't even worry-
- Don't tell me about anything. I wanna ask you a question.

When you came pulling in here,

01:54:13,236 --> 01:54:16,440
did you notice the sign on the front
of my house that said, "Dead Nigger Storage"?

1695

- You know I ain't seen no-
- Did you notice the sign on the front of my house...

that said,
"Dead Nigger Storage"?

see that sign? - [ Sighs ] Why?

niggers ain't my fuckin' business, that's why!

dead body in her house, I'm gonna get divorced?

No marriage counselor. No trial separation.
I'm gonna get fuckin' divorced.

Okay? And I don't wanna
get fuckin' divorced!

but I don't wanna lose my wife doin' it.

gonna make me forget I love my wife. Is there?

Now, look, you know, she comes home
from work in about an hour and a half.

The graveyard shift
at the hospital.

You gotta make some phone calls?
You gotta call some people?

1711

Well, then, do it, and then get the fuck
out of my house before she gets here.

Do me that favor, all right? The phone
is in my bedroom. I suggest you get going.

1781
01:59:13,776 --> 01:59:16,594
Take the body,
stick it in the trunk.

1782
01:59:16,656 --> 01:59:19,278
This looks to be
a pretty domesticated house.

1783
01:59:19,345 --> 01:59:23,124
- That would lead me to believe you got
cleansers and shit. - Yeah. Under the sink.

1784
01:59:23,185 --> 01:59:26,485
Good. What I need you two fellas to do
is take those cleaning products...

1785
01:59:26,547 --> 01:59:30,414
and clean the inside of the car-
I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast.

1786
01:59:30,484 --> 01:59:34,263
Go in the back seat, scoop up all
those little pieces of brain and skull.

1787
01:59:34,325 --> 01:59:37,143
Get it out of there.
Wipe down the upholstery.

1788
01:59:37,141 --> 01:59:40,088
It don't need to be spick-and-span.
You don't need to eat off it.

1789
01:59:40,086 --> 01:59:44,280
Just give it a good once-over. What you
need to take care of are the really messy parts.

1790
01:59:44,342 --> 01:59:48,275
The pools of blood that have collected,
you gotta soak that shit up.

1791
01:59:48,344 --> 01:59:50,681
We need to raid
your linen closet.

1792
01:59:50,744 --> 01:59:53,562
I need blankets,
I need comforters, quilts, bedspreads.

1793
01:59:53,625 --> 01:59:57,110
The thicker the better,
the darker the better. No whites. Can't use 'em.

1794
01:59:57,178 --> 02:00:02,269
We'll need to camouflage the front seat
and back seat and floorboards...

1795
02:00:02,331 --> 02:00:04,188
with quilts and blankets,

1796
02:00:04,251 --> 02:00:08,063
so if a cop starts stickin' his big
snout in the car, the subterfuge won't last,

1797
02:00:08,092 --> 02:00:10,845
but at a glance the car
will appear to be normal.

1798
02:00:10,909 --> 02:00:12,885
Jimmie, lead the way.
Boys, get to work.

1799
02:00:12,957 --> 02:00:14,651
"Please" would be nice.

1800
02:00:16,061 --> 02:00:18,880
- Come again?
- I said, a "please" would be nice.

1801
02:00:20,702 --> 02:00:24,514
Get it straight, buster. I'm not here to say please.
I'm here to tell you what to do.

1802
02:00:26,112 --> 02:00:28,929
And if self-preservation
is an instinct you possess,

1803
02:00:28,992 --> 02:00:31,329
you'd better fuckin' do it
and do it quick.

1804
02:00:31,393 --> 02:00:35,140
I'm here to help. If my help's
not appreciated, lotsa luck, gentlemen.

1805
02:00:35,137 --> 02:00:38,469
No, Mr. Wolf, it ain't like that;
your help is definitely appreciated.

1806
02:00:38,466 --> 02:00:41,349
Mr. Wolf, listen. I don't
mean disrespect, okay? I respect you.

1807
02:00:41,347 --> 02:00:44,034
I just don't like people
barkin' orders at me.

1808
02:00:44,099 --> 02:00:47,037
If I'm curt with you,
it's because time is a factor.

1809
02:00:47,108 --> 02:00:51,554
I think fast, I talk fast, and I need you
guys to act fast if you wanna get out of this.

1810
02:00:51,621 --> 02:00:54,920
So pretty please, with sugar on top,
clean the fuckin' car.

1811
02:00:59,239 --> 02:01:02,756
Don't be lookin' at me like that,
all right? I can feel your look.

1812
02:01:05,352 --> 02:01:07,942
It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.

1813
02:01:08,010 --> 02:01:09,867
[ Sipping ]

1814
02:01:09,930 --> 02:01:11,787
Green.

1815
02:01:13,321 --> 02:01:16,140
Nothin' except for
the mess inside.

1816
02:01:18,251 --> 02:01:20,589
Mmm, about 20 minutes.

1817
02:01:22,028 --> 02:01:23,885
Nobody who'll be missed.

1818
02:01:25,868 --> 02:01:28,687
You're a good man, Joe.
Thanks a bunch.

1819
02:01:29,741 --> 02:01:31,598
- How we comin', Jimmie?
- Pretty good.

1820
02:01:31,661 --> 02:01:34,698
- I got it all here, but, uh,
- [ Sighs ]

1821
02:01:34,696 --> 02:01:38,130
- Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand something.
- Winston, Jimmie, Winston.

1822
02:01:38,127 --> 02:01:41,514
Okay. You gotta
understand something, uh, Winston.

1823
02:01:41,584 --> 02:01:43,442
Uh- Uh, no,
thank you.

1824
02:01:43,505 --> 02:01:46,508
Uh, this is
our best linen here,

1825
02:01:46,577 --> 02:01:49,395
and it's, uh-
it was a wedding present...

1826
02:01:49,458 --> 02:01:51,795
from my Uncle Conrad
and my Aunt Ginny.

1827
02:01:51,858 --> 02:01:56,119
- They're not with us anymore.
I wanna help- - Let me ask you a question.

1828
02:01:56,179 --> 02:01:58,998
- If you don't mind.
- No, no, please. Go ahead.

1829
02:02:00,500 --> 02:02:05,208
Your Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny,
were they millionaires?

1830
02:02:06,293 --> 02:02:08,150
No.

1831
02:02:08,214 --> 02:02:10,551
Well, your Uncle Marsellus is.

1832
02:02:10,614 --> 02:02:13,935
And I'm positive that if
Uncle Conrad and Aunt...

1833
02:02:14,006 --> 02:02:16,344
- Ginny.
- Ginny were here,

1834
02:02:16,408 --> 02:02:20,504
they would furnish you
with a whole bedroom set,

1835
02:02:20,568 --> 02:02:23,571
which your Uncle Marsellus
is more than happy to do.

1836
02:02:27,386 --> 02:02:31,165
I like oak myself.
That's what I have in my bedroom.

1837
02:02:32,251 --> 02:02:34,108
How about you, Jimmie?

1838
02:02:35,292 --> 02:02:37,148
You an oak man?

1839
02:02:38,204 --> 02:02:40,062
Oak's nice.

1840
02:02:45,661 --> 02:02:49,375
Oh, man, I will never
forgive your ass for this shit.

1841
02:02:49,438 --> 02:02:51,776
This is some fucked-up,
repugnant shit.

1842
02:02:51,775 --> 02:02:55,202
Jules, did you ever hear the philosophy
that once a man admits he is wrong...

1843
02:02:55,200 --> 02:02:58,018
that he is immediately forgiven
for all wrongdoings?

1844
02:02:58,080 --> 02:03:00,899
Get the fuck out my face
with that shit!

1845
02:03:00,897 --> 02:03:03,779
The motherfucker that said that shit never
had to pick up itty-bitty pieces of skull...

1846
02:03:03,777 --> 02:03:07,462
- on account of your dumb ass.
- I got a threshold, Jules, for the abuse that I will take.

1847
02:03:07,459 --> 02:03:10,911
Right now, I'm a fuckin' race car,
and you got me in the red.

1848
02:03:10,908 --> 02:03:14,342
I'm just sayin' it's fuckin' dangerous
to have a race car in the fuckin' red.

1849
02:03:14,340 --> 02:03:16,197
That's all.
I could blow.

1850
02:03:16,260 --> 02:03:18,117
- Oh, you ready to blow?
- Yeah.

1851
02:03:18,116 --> 02:03:21,063
Well, I'm a mushroom-cloud-layin'
motherfucker, motherfucker.

1852
02:03:21,061 --> 02:03:23,880
Every time my fingers touch brain,
I'm Superfly T.N.T.

1853
02:03:23,942 --> 02:03:25,799
I'm the Guns of the Navarone.

1854
02:03:25,862 --> 02:03:28,681
In fact, what the fuck
am I doin' in the back?

1855
02:03:28,679 --> 02:03:31,915
You're the motherfucker should be on
brain detail! We're fuckin' switchin'.

1856
02:03:31,912 --> 02:03:35,090
I'm washin' windows, and you're
pickin' up this nigger's skull!

1857
02:03:43,626 --> 02:03:45,484
Fine job, gentlemen.

1858
02:03:46,763 --> 02:03:49,101
You may get out of this yet.

1859
02:03:49,164 --> 02:03:51,501
I can't believe
this is the same car.

1860
02:03:51,564 --> 02:03:54,864
Well, let's not start suckin'
each other's dicks quite yet.

1861
02:03:54,862 --> 02:03:58,288
Phase one is complete- Clean the car-
which moves us right along to Phase two:

1862
02:03:58,285 --> 02:04:00,143
Clean you two.

1863
02:04:01,647 --> 02:04:03,437
Strip.

1864
02:04:03,504 --> 02:04:07,119
- All the way?
- [ Wolf ] To your bare ass.

1865
02:04:07,184 --> 02:04:10,155
Quickly, gentlemen.
We got about 15 minutes...

1866
02:04:10,153 --> 02:04:13,108
before Jimmie's better half
comes pulling into the driveway.

1867
02:04:13,106 --> 02:04:15,497
Goddamn, this morning air
is some chilly shit.

1868
02:04:15,495 --> 02:04:17,572
Are you sure this is
absolutely necessary?

1869
02:04:17,571 --> 02:04:19,846
- You know what you two look like?
- [ Vincent ] What?

1870
02:04:19,845 --> 02:04:23,144
Like a couple of guys
who just blew off somebody's head.

1871
02:04:23,204 --> 02:04:26,436
Strippin' off those bloody rags
is absolutely necessary.

1872
02:04:30,568 --> 02:04:32,936
Toss 'em in Jimmie's garbage bag.

1873
02:04:32,998 --> 02:04:37,259
Don't do nothin' stupid, like leavin' this
shit out front for the garbageman to pick up.

1874
02:04:37,321 --> 02:04:41,384
Don't worry, we're taking it with us.
Jim, the soap.

1875
02:04:42,760 --> 02:04:44,617
- Vincent.
- [ Wolf ] Okay, gentlemen.

1876
02:04:44,680 --> 02:04:48,034
You both been to County before,
I'm sure. Here it comes.

1877
02:04:48,105 --> 02:04:50,924
- Goddamn! The water's fuckin' cold!
- Yo! Yo! Yo!

1878
02:04:50,986 --> 02:04:54,088
Better you than me, gentlemen.
[ Chuckling ]

1879
02:04:54,086 --> 02:04:57,038
- Don't be afraid of the soap.
Spread it around. - [ Yelling Continues ]

1880
02:04:57,036 --> 02:04:59,854
- Get 'em there a little bit.
Vincent's hair. - Hey, get out of my hair!

1881
02:04:59,852 --> 02:05:02,638
- Come on. Do it, goddamn it! Do it!
- Uh, um-

1882
02:05:03,661 --> 02:05:05,519
Towel.

1883
02:05:15,600 --> 02:05:18,637
[ Wolf ] You're dry enough.
Toss 'em their clothes.

1884
02:05:18,705 --> 02:05:21,840
[ Wolf Laughing ]
Perfect.

1885
02:05:21,905 --> 02:05:25,226
Perfect. We couldn't have
planned this better.

1886
02:05:25,299 --> 02:05:27,156
You guys look like-

1887
02:05:27,219 --> 02:05:29,555
What do they look like,
Jimmie?

1888
02:05:29,619 --> 02:05:33,070
- Dorks. They look like
a couple of dorks. - [ Laughing ]

1889
02:05:33,139 --> 02:05:36,493
- [ Both Laughing ]
- Ha-ha-ha. They're your clothes, motherfucker.

1890
02:05:36,490 --> 02:05:39,253
Come on, gentlemen.
We're laughing our way right into prison.

1891
02:05:39,251 --> 02:05:41,109
Don't make me beg.

1892
02:05:44,053 --> 02:05:47,353
Okay, gentlemen, let's get
our rules of the road straight.

1893
02:05:47,415 --> 02:05:50,833
We're going to a place
called Monster Joe's Truck and Tow.

1894
02:05:50,831 --> 02:05:53,785
Monster Joe and his daughter Raquel
are sympathetic to our dilemma.

1895
02:05:53,783 --> 02:05:55,608
The place is North Hollywood,

1896
02:05:55,671 --> 02:05:59,505
so a few twists and turns aside,
we'll be goin' up Hollywood Way.

1897
02:05:59,577 --> 02:06:02,778
Now, I'll drive the tainted car.
Jules, you ride with me.

1898
02:06:04,122 --> 02:06:05,979
Vincent, you follow
in my Acura.

1899
02:06:06,043 --> 02:06:09,822
Now, if we come across the path
of any John Q. Laws,

1900
02:06:09,883 --> 02:06:12,854
- nobody does a fuckin' thing
'til I do something. - Right.

1901
02:06:12,924 --> 02:06:15,742
- What did I say?
- Don't do shit unless.

1902
02:06:15,805 --> 02:06:17,979
- Unless what?
- Unless you do it first.

1903
02:06:18,045 --> 02:06:20,383
Spoken like a true prodigy.

1904
02:06:20,382 --> 02:06:23,809
How about you, Lash LaRue? Can you
keep your spurs from jingling and jangling?

1905
02:06:23,807 --> 02:06:27,739
The gun went off. I don't know why.
I'm cool. I promise you.

1906
02:06:27,808 --> 02:06:30,626
Fair enough. Now, I drive real
fuckin' fast, so keep up.

1907
02:06:30,689 --> 02:06:33,080
If get my car back
any different than I gave it,

1908
02:06:33,154 --> 02:06:35,971
Monster Joe's gonna be
disposing of two bodies.

1909
02:06:36,034 --> 02:06:39,584
- [ Metal Door Slamming ]
- [ Engine ldling ]

1910
02:06:39,650 --> 02:06:41,277
Outta my way, Rex.

1911
02:06:42,787 --> 02:06:45,124
- We cool?
- Like it never happened.

1912
02:06:45,187 --> 02:06:48,804
- [ Vincent ] All right.
- Boys, this is Raquel.

1913
02:06:48,868 --> 02:06:51,392
Someday all this will be hers.

1914
02:06:51,462 --> 02:06:54,214
Hi. So, what's
with the outfits?

1915
02:06:54,278 --> 02:06:57,577
- You guys going to
a volleyball game or something? - [ Wolf Laughs ]

1916
02:06:57,637 --> 02:06:59,975
I'm takin' milady
out for breakfast.

1917
02:07:00,040 --> 02:07:02,693
Maybe I could drop you two off.
Where do you live?

1918
02:07:02,759 --> 02:07:04,070
- Redondo.
- Inglewood.

1919
02:07:04,135 --> 02:07:07,434
It's-
It's your future. I-

1920
02:07:07,495 --> 02:07:10,150
I see a-
a cab ride.

1921
02:07:10,216 --> 02:07:13,067
Move outta the sticks, fellas.
Say good night, Raquel.

1922
02:07:13,129 --> 02:07:15,947
- Good night, Raquel.
- I'll see you guys around.

02:15:38,949 --> 02:15:42,727
If you don't open that case,
I'm gonna unload in your fucking face.

2066
02:15:46,948 --> 02:15:48,806
We clear?

2067
02:15:51,814 --> 02:15:53,671
One.

2068
02:15:55,432 --> 02:15:57,856
Two.

2069
02:15:57,928 --> 02:15:59,905
- Three.
- Okay, Ringo.

2070
02:15:59,976 --> 02:16:01,953
You win.

2071
02:16:02,025 --> 02:16:03,882
It's yours.

2072
02:16:07,755 --> 02:16:10,375
- Open it.
- [ Latches Springing ]

2073
02:16:14,090 --> 02:16:16,231
[ Honey Bunny ]
Hey, what is it?

2074
02:16:16,299 --> 02:16:18,540
What is it?

2075
02:16:18,605 --> 02:16:21,094
Is that what I think it is?

2076
02:16:21,164 --> 02:16:23,753
Mm-hmm.

2077
02:16:25,262 --> 02:16:27,304
It's beautiful.

2078
02:16:27,374 --> 02:16:29,832
[ Giggling ]
Goddamn it, what is it?

2079
02:16:31,247 --> 02:16:34,065
You let him go!
You let him go!

2080
02:16:34,064 --> 02:16:37,042
- Let go of him, or I'm gonna kill you!
- Tell that bitch to be cool.

2081
02:16:37,039 --> 02:16:39,922
- Say, "Bitch, be cool!"
Say, "Bitch, be cool!" - Be cool! Be cool!

2082
02:16:39,920 --> 02:16:42,611
- Tell that bitch to chill!
- You're gonna die so fuckin' bad!

2083
02:16:42,610 --> 02:16:45,395
- Chill that fuckin' bitch out!
- Chill out, Honey Bunny!

2084
02:16:45,393 --> 02:16:47,251
- Let go of him!
- Chill out, Honey Bunny!

2085
02:16:47,250 --> 02:16:50,068
- Now, promise her
it's gonna be all right! - I promise!

2086
02:16:50,067 --> 02:16:52,021
- Tell her to chill!
- Chill out, Honey Bunny!

2087
02:16:52,020 --> 02:16:53,877
- Now tell me her name.
- Yolanda.

2088
02:16:53,940 --> 02:16:57,291
All right, now, Yolanda, we're not
gonna do anything stupid, are we?

2089
02:16:57,300 --> 02:17:00,118
- Don't you hurt him!
- Nobody's gonna hurt anybody!

2090
02:17:00,117 --> 02:17:03,609
We're all gonna be like three little
Fonzies here. And what's Fonzie like?

2091
02:17:03,606 --> 02:17:07,123
- Come on, Yolanda!
What's Fonzie like? - He's cool.

2092
02:17:07,191 --> 02:17:09,048
- What?
- Cool.

2093
02:17:09,112 --> 02:17:11,831
Correctamundo.
And that's what we're gonna be.

2094
02:17:11,896 --> 02:17:13,753
We're gonna be cool.

2095
02:17:13,816 --> 02:17:18,524
Now, Ringo,
I'm gonna count to three.

2096
02:17:18,585 --> 02:17:20,594
And when I count three,

2097
02:17:20,666 --> 02:17:23,483
I want you to
let go of your gun,

2098
02:17:23,547 --> 02:17:26,866
put your palms flat on the table
and sit your ass down.

2099
02:17:27,899 --> 02:17:29,876
And when you do it,

2100
02:17:29,947 --> 02:17:31,924
you do it cool.

2101
02:17:31,996 --> 02:17:34,235
You ready?

2102
02:17:34,301 --> 02:17:36,310
One,

2103
02:17:36,381 --> 02:17:38,488
two,

2104
02:17:38,557 --> 02:17:40,414
three.

2105
02:17:47,103 --> 02:17:50,107
- [ Panting ] Okay, now you let him go!
- Yolanda!

2106
02:17:50,105 --> 02:17:53,699
I thought you were gonna be cool. Now,
when you yell at me, it makes me nervous.

2107
02:17:53,696 --> 02:17:55,706
When I get nervous,
I get scared.

2108
02:17:55,777 --> 02:17:59,819
When motherfuckers get scared,
that's when motherfuckers accidentally get shot.

2109
02:18:01,025 --> 02:18:04,510
Just know, you hurt him, you die.

2110
02:18:04,579 --> 02:18:07,846
Well, that seems to be
the situation.

2111
02:18:07,908 --> 02:18:09,764
But I don't want that.

2112
02:18:09,828 --> 02:18:11,685
And you don't want that.

2113
02:18:11,749 --> 02:18:14,370
And Ringo here definitely
doesn't want that.

2114
02:18:14,437 --> 02:18:16,446
So let's see what we can do.

2115
02:18:18,759 --> 02:18:21,861
Now... here's the situation.

2116
02:18:21,927 --> 02:18:25,641
Normally both your asses would be
dead as fuckin' fried chicken,

2117
02:18:25,638 --> 02:18:29,067
but you happened to pull this shit
while I'm in a transitional period,

2118
02:18:29,064 --> 02:18:31,883
and I don't wanna kill you;
I wanna help you.

2119
02:18:31,945 --> 02:18:35,724
But I can't give you this case,
'cause it don't belong to me.

2120
02:18:35,722 --> 02:18:38,668
Besides, I been through too much shit
over this case this morning...

2121
02:18:38,666 --> 02:18:41,485
to just hand it over
to your dumb ass.

2122
02:18:41,547 --> 02:18:43,338
- Vincent!
- [ Yells ]

2123
02:18:43,403 --> 02:18:46,222
- Be cool! Yolanda, it's cool, baby.
- Get back!

2124
02:18:46,284 --> 02:18:48,873
It's cool!
We still just talkin'.

2125
02:18:48,941 --> 02:18:52,939
- Come on. Point the gun at me. Point the gun at me.
There you go. - [ Yolanda Whimpering ]

2126
02:18:53,005 --> 02:18:54,982
Now, Vincent, you just hang back...

2127
02:18:55,053 --> 02:18:56,910
and don't do
a goddamn thing.

2128
02:18:56,974 --> 02:18:58,831
Tell her it's still cool.

2129
02:18:58,894 --> 02:19:01,712
- It's still cool, Honey Bunny.
- How we doin', baby?

2130
02:19:03,055 --> 02:19:05,612
I- I gotta go pee.

2131
02:19:05,680 --> 02:19:07,537
I wanna go home.

2132
02:19:07,600 --> 02:19:11,053
Hang in there, baby. I'm proud of you.
And Ringo's proud of you.

2133
02:19:11,122 --> 02:19:13,940
It's almost over.
Tell her you're proud of her.

2134
02:19:14,003 --> 02:19:17,235
- I'm proud of you, Honey Bunny.
- I love you.

2135
02:19:17,298 --> 02:19:20,335
- I love you too, Honey Bunny.
- Now,

2136
02:19:20,403 --> 02:19:24,183
I want you to go in that bag
and find my wallet.

2137
02:19:26,614 --> 02:19:30,393
- Which one is it?
- It's the one that says "Bad Motherfucker."

2138
02:19:44,069 --> 02:19:46,527
That's it.
That's my bad motherfucker.

2139
02:19:46,597 --> 02:19:49,568
Open it up.
Take out the money.

2140
02:19:54,406 --> 02:19:56,482
[ Jules ]
Count it.

2141
02:20:02,536 --> 02:20:04,960
How much is there?

2142
02:20:06,793 --> 02:20:08,650
About 1,500 dollars.

2143
02:20:08,714 --> 02:20:11,783
Okay, put it in your pocket.
It's yours.

2144
02:20:11,850 --> 02:20:14,921
Now, with the rest
of those wallets and the register,

2145
02:20:14,919 --> 02:20:17,069
that makes this a pretty successful
little score, huh?

2146
02:20:17,067 --> 02:20:20,879
Jules, you give that fuckin' nimrod 1,500
dollars, and I'll shoot him on general principle.

2147
02:20:20,876 --> 02:20:24,239
No, Yolanda! Yolanda! He ain't gonna
do a goddamn, motherfuckin' thing!

2148
02:20:24,237 --> 02:20:26,247
Vince, shut the fuck up!

2149
02:20:26,318 --> 02:20:30,032
- Shut up!
- Come on, Yolanda. Stay with me, baby.

2150
02:20:30,094 --> 02:20:32,913
Now, I ain't givin' it
to him, Vincent.

2151
02:20:32,975 --> 02:20:34,832
I'm buyin' something
for my money.

2152
02:20:36,016 --> 02:20:39,085
- Wanna know what I'm buyin', Ringo?
- What?

2153
02:20:39,152 --> 02:20:43,696
Your life. I'm givin' you that money
so I don't have to kill your ass.

2154
02:20:43,761 --> 02:20:46,351
You read the Bible, Ringo?

2155
02:20:47,378 --> 02:20:49,235
Not regularly, no.

2156
02:20:49,299 --> 02:20:51,635
Well, there's this passage
I got memorized.

2157
02:20:51,699 --> 02:20:55,086
Ezekiel 25:17.

2158
02:20:55,156 --> 02:20:57,876
"The path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides...

2159
02:20:57,940 --> 02:20:59,798
by the inequities
of the selfish...

2160
02:20:59,861 --> 02:21:01,718
and the tyranny of evil men.

2161
02:21:01,781 --> 02:21:05,014
Blessed is he who,
in the name of charity and good will,

2162
02:21:05,012 --> 02:21:07,480
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness,

2163
02:21:07,478 --> 02:21:11,411
for he is truly his brother's keeper
and the finder of lost children.

2164
02:21:11,479 --> 02:21:15,608
And I will strike down upon thee with
great vengeance and furious anger...

2165
02:21:15,673 --> 02:21:18,611
those who attempt to poison
and destroy My brothers.

2166
02:21:18,681 --> 02:21:21,586
And you will know
I am the Lord...

2167
02:21:21,657 --> 02:21:25,077
when I lay My vengeance
upon you."

2168
02:21:26,107 --> 02:21:28,444
I been sayin' that shit for years,

2169
02:21:28,506 --> 02:21:31,544
and if you heard it,
that meant your ass.

2170
02:21:31,612 --> 02:21:34,430
I never gave much thought
to what it meant.

2171
02:21:34,429 --> 02:21:37,375
I just thought it was some coldblooded
shit to say to a motherfucker...

2172
02:21:37,373 --> 02:21:39,711
before I popped a cap
in his ass.

2173
02:21:39,774 --> 02:21:43,072
But I saw some shit this morning
made me think twice.

2174
02:21:43,135 --> 02:21:45,952
See, now I'm thinkin'
maybe it means...

2175
02:21:46,015 --> 02:21:50,690
you're the evil man,
and I'm the righteous man,

2176
02:21:50,751 --> 02:21:53,570
and Mr. 9-millimeter here,
he's the shepherd...

2177
02:21:53,632 --> 02:21:57,052
protecting my righteous ass
in the valley of darkness.

2178
02:21:57,122 --> 02:21:58,979
Or it could mean...

2179
02:21:59,042 --> 02:22:02,341
you're the righteous man,
and I'm the shepherd,

2180
02:22:02,402 --> 02:22:06,182
and it's the world
that's evil and selfish.

2181
02:22:06,243 --> 02:22:08,418
Now, I'd like that.

2182
02:22:08,484 --> 02:22:11,270
But that shit
ain't the truth.

2183
02:22:11,333 --> 02:22:13,123
The truth is,

2184
02:22:14,150 --> 02:22:16,005
you're the weak...

2185
02:22:17,351 --> 02:22:20,616
and I'm the tyranny
of evil men.

2186
02:22:21,960 --> 02:22:23,816
But I'm tryin', Ringo.

2187
02:22:25,032 --> 02:22:27,851
I'm tryin' real hard...

2188
02:22:27,913 --> 02:22:30,086
to be the shepherd.

2189
02:22:44,779 --> 02:22:46,636
Go.

2190
02:23:03,601 --> 02:23:05,937
I think we should be
leaving now.

2191
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,818
- [ "Surf Rider" ]
- Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
