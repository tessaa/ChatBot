1
00:01:01,515 --> 00:01:04,975
Is my cock exquisite?

2
00:01:11,395 --> 00:01:14,615
Oh, cos I think it's
fucking exquisite.

3
00:01:16,435 --> 00:01:20,331
I think it's a fucking work of art.

4
00:01:21,034 --> 00:01:23,533
Like a Renoir.

5
00:01:23,594 --> 00:01:25,896
Or a Picasso.

6
00:01:27,714 --> 00:01:32,616
The painting of my cock
should hang at the Louvre.

7
00:01:33,074 --> 00:01:35,792
They should study my
cock in art classes,

8
00:01:35,793 --> 00:01:37,691
spend whole courses...

9
00:01:37,713 --> 00:01:41,654
studying the splendid contours of
its exquisiteness, don't you think?

10
00:01:43,194 --> 00:01:46,512
They should also study
my cock in science class

11
00:01:46,513 --> 00:01:49,012
cos it defies nature.

12
00:01:49,913 --> 00:01:51,539
My cock is hard.

13
00:01:51,553 --> 00:01:54,872
It's metal, it's steel,
it's titanium.

14
00:01:54,873 --> 00:01:57,312
It does not break.
It does not weaken.

15
00:01:57,313 --> 00:01:59,779
My cock can stand all day

16
00:01:59,792 --> 00:02:03,930
like a good soldier trying
to impress his superiors.

17
00:02:03,992 --> 00:02:07,169
If my cock could win
a medal, it would.

18
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:10,652
If they could name a school
after it, it should.

19
00:02:10,673 --> 00:02:14,012
If it could save small Somali
children from starving,

20
00:02:14,072 --> 00:02:17,751
it would and should, and it'll have
a Nobel fucking Peace Prize for it,

21
00:02:17,752 --> 00:02:20,808
the first such prize
ever given to a cock.

22
00:02:20,832 --> 00:02:25,810
My Nobel Prize-winning
cook's like a cheetah,

23
00:02:25,831 --> 00:02:28,991
all sleek and dangerous and deadly.

24
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:33,216
Sonnets should be written about
how dangerous my cheetah cock is.

25
00:02:33,232 --> 00:02:34,453
Poems, plays.

26
00:02:34,471 --> 00:02:38,576
Wars should be won over it,
kingdoms fallen because of it.

27
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:40,990
My cock is lightning. It is fire.

28
00:02:40,991 --> 00:02:46,538
It is a volcano brewing with
the sacred semen, lava...

29
00:02:48,671 --> 00:02:50,870
Sugar and spice and all things...

30
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:54,536
nice.

31
00:02:54,671 --> 00:02:56,373
Sorry for the lack
of warning, dearie.

32
00:02:59,391 --> 00:03:01,229
Things happen.

33
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:04,690
Sometimes you expect 'em,
sometimes you don't.

34
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:18,349
I said, "Give me 200 quid, I'll light
my fag off two fucking fireworks."

35
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,327
- Dickie nips off round the corner...
- Hemingway.

36
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:22,549
I'm eating my pudding.

37
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,109
I couldn't give a toss
about your pudding.

38
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,648
Put your fork down
and get over 'ere.

39
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:28,251
I'll put my fork down when I'm
ready to put my fork down.

40
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:30,735
I'll finish my pudding when I'm
ready to finish my pudding.

41
00:03:30,749 --> 00:03:32,811
You wanna disrespect
me, disrespect me.

42
00:03:32,909 --> 00:03:35,135
But then I won't be able
to tell you what I know.

43
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:37,308
And I know you'd like
to know what I know.

44
00:03:37,309 --> 00:03:39,468
- What would I like to know?
- Wouldn't you like to know?

45
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,291
- I would like to know.
- Yeah, you would, wouldn't ya?

46
00:03:41,308 --> 00:03:42,769
- Tell me.
- Fork.

47
00:03:43,228 --> 00:03:44,689
Fuck.

48
00:03:46,189 --> 00:03:48,655
Oh, for Christ's sake, Dom,
just put the fork down.

49
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:00,606
Tell me what it is
you have to tell me.

50
00:04:01,268 --> 00:04:02,893
Call came in.

51
00:04:03,188 --> 00:04:04,227
Call?

52
00:04:04,227 --> 00:04:05,284
The call.

53
00:04:07,508 --> 00:04:08,806
The call?

54
00:04:08,988 --> 00:04:10,252
Came in.

55
00:04:46,506 --> 00:04:51,004
Dom! Dom! Dom! Dom!

56
00:05:35,064 --> 00:05:37,023
Oi! Where's Sandy Butterfield?

57
00:05:37,024 --> 00:05:39,343
- Dom? Dom, is that you?
- Where's Sandy Butterfield?

58
00:05:39,344 --> 00:05:40,783
Dom, you really don't wanna...

59
00:05:40,784 --> 00:05:42,650
Where's Sandy Butterfield?

60
00:05:43,624 --> 00:05:44,725
Where?

61
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:47,329
He's still working at the depot.

62
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:05,203
- Hey, where are you going?
- Where's Sandy Butterfield?

63
00:06:05,223 --> 00:06:08,083
- Sir, I...
- Where's Sandy Butterfield?

64
00:06:27,822 --> 00:06:29,164
Sandy.

65
00:06:40,302 --> 00:06:42,528
So that's what you do, is it, mate?

66
00:06:42,582 --> 00:06:45,321
You fuck other men's wives
while they're in prison.

67
00:06:45,381 --> 00:06:47,039
That's what you do with yourself,

68
00:06:47,061 --> 00:06:49,700
how you conduct yourself, how
you conduct your business.

69
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:52,604
- I don't know...
- She was my wife. My wife!

70
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:55,925
- You were divorced and in jail!
- She was still my wife.

71
00:06:55,981 --> 00:06:57,980
Always my wife, you fuck.

72
00:06:57,981 --> 00:07:00,567
You fucker! My betrothed.

73
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:04,339
You're nothing but a pestilence, an
uphill gardener with a weak chin.

74
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,940
You're a filthafising thief,

75
00:07:05,941 --> 00:07:08,047
that's what you are. You
think you can steal from me?

76
00:07:08,221 --> 00:07:10,740
- From me? From Dom Hemingway?
- God...

77
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,479
God!

78
00:07:45,739 --> 00:07:47,244
Hello, Billy.

79
00:07:47,979 --> 00:07:49,156
Andrew.

80
00:07:49,419 --> 00:07:52,279
Hello, Dom. Long time.

81
00:07:53,619 --> 00:07:54,676
Welcome home.

82
00:07:55,338 --> 00:07:56,996
Thanks.

83
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,658
You good? Betty good?

84
00:07:58,659 --> 00:07:59,716
Yeah.

85
00:08:00,018 --> 00:08:02,604
Charlie just graduated university.

86
00:08:03,459 --> 00:08:06,843
Little Charlie with his hair all growing
in his eyes graduated university?

87
00:08:07,299 --> 00:08:09,361
Can you believe it?

88
00:08:16,498 --> 00:08:19,281
I should fucking kill you,

89
00:08:19,498 --> 00:08:21,396
but I fancy a pint instead.

90
00:08:27,617 --> 00:08:29,876
I've got anger issues,
Dickie, I just do.

91
00:08:31,137 --> 00:08:32,402
Always have, haven't I?

92
00:08:32,777 --> 00:08:36,281
I tried to work on 'em, you know,
in prison. Took some classes.

93
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:40,273
I tried the yoga, inspirational
CDs, I did it all.

94
00:08:41,097 --> 00:08:42,842
But the anger's still inside of me.

95
00:08:44,097 --> 00:08:45,919
I just lost it, I guess.

96
00:08:46,177 --> 00:08:49,233
He married Keethy.
What's a man to do?

97
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:51,679
Well, I broke his fucking nose.

98
00:08:51,777 --> 00:08:53,522
He wasn't so good-looking
to start with.

99
00:08:55,297 --> 00:08:56,415
He wet himself.

100
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:57,495
He had it coming.

101
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:58,957
Still...

102
00:09:00,776 --> 00:09:03,602
Er, sorry, Dom, you
can't smoke in here.

103
00:09:05,056 --> 00:09:08,275
- You what?
- They banned it, smoking.

104
00:09:08,976 --> 00:09:11,975
In a pub? You can't
smoke in a fucking pub?

105
00:09:11,976 --> 00:09:13,120
Bad for your health.

106
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:15,935
Being a cunt is bad for your
health, I'm just smoking a fag.

107
00:09:15,936 --> 00:09:18,042
Got one for me while you're at it?

108
00:09:35,255 --> 00:09:37,118
He's expecting you
in France, you know,

109
00:09:37,214 --> 00:09:38,675
Mr Fontaine.

110
00:09:39,374 --> 00:09:41,032
He knows what you did for him.

111
00:09:42,695 --> 00:09:45,373
Mr Fontaine's a man who
doesn't forget his friends.

112
00:09:45,374 --> 00:09:47,917
- I'm his friend now?
- You did right by him.

113
00:09:48,014 --> 00:09:49,654
You'll get your due.

114
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:51,574
12 years, Dickie.

115
00:09:51,574 --> 00:09:53,200
12 years of my life.

116
00:09:54,534 --> 00:09:57,273
I missed a lot doing right by him.

117
00:09:57,974 --> 00:09:59,959
Missed Keethy's funeral.

118
00:10:00,054 --> 00:10:02,433
Missed out on my
Evelyn's childhood.

119
00:10:02,854 --> 00:10:04,676
My daughter.

120
00:10:10,933 --> 00:10:12,219
You got to see her yet?

121
00:10:14,134 --> 00:10:15,956
I'm working up the marbles.

122
00:10:16,093 --> 00:10:18,012
You've had 12 years to
work up the marbles...

123
00:10:18,013 --> 00:10:21,309
I just made Bolognese out
of her stepfather's face.

124
00:10:21,893 --> 00:10:23,878
As if she didn't hate me enough.

125
00:10:27,653 --> 00:10:30,359
Mr Fontaine, he
bought them for you.

126
00:10:30,372 --> 00:10:33,319
A little welcome-home present,
if you're interested.

127
00:10:46,052 --> 00:10:48,278
- For me?
- For you.

128
00:10:52,292 --> 00:10:55,075
Oh, I love this fucking song!

129
00:10:57,371 --> 00:10:59,331
You hear that, Dickie?

130
00:10:59,331 --> 00:11:01,850
- Yeah, Dom.
- You hear that? You know what that is?

131
00:11:01,851 --> 00:11:03,091
What, Dom? What is it?

132
00:11:03,092 --> 00:11:05,514
That's the sound of
fucking freedom!

133
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:07,210
Innit, Jeanie, eh?

134
00:11:07,211 --> 00:11:09,050
Oh, my love! Innit?

135
00:11:13,851 --> 00:11:15,673
Hello, ladies.

136
00:11:17,251 --> 00:11:19,357
- Whoa!
- Come on, then.

137
00:11:22,411 --> 00:11:24,790
No one call me for three days.

138
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:41,350
Oh, my head's throbbing.

139
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:44,392
It's fucking throbbing, Dickie.

140
00:11:44,769 --> 00:11:47,609
Like a disco in my head.
Like a fucking Manila disco

141
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:50,665
full of transvestites
and suckling pigs.

142
00:11:51,009 --> 00:11:53,168
I've got a seizure in my brain.

143
00:11:53,169 --> 00:11:56,990
A diabolical seizure of
fucking and sucking coke.

144
00:11:57,169 --> 00:11:58,794
I did too much.

145
00:11:58,849 --> 00:12:01,872
I tried to make up for
too much lost time.

146
00:12:02,369 --> 00:12:04,235
I fucked myself to death.

147
00:12:05,129 --> 00:12:06,667
My head's gonna explode.

148
00:12:06,729 --> 00:12:09,588
Bits of my brain's
gonna go everywhere.

149
00:12:09,689 --> 00:12:11,287
I'm gonna ruin your blazer.

150
00:12:11,288 --> 00:12:12,967
You're gonna be all right, Dom.

151
00:12:12,968 --> 00:12:14,527
Fuck you. You don't know my head.

152
00:12:14,528 --> 00:12:17,047
You don't know the
revolution going on...

153
00:12:17,048 --> 00:12:18,487
inside of it.

154
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:21,511
Fucking insurgents inside my brain.

155
00:12:21,569 --> 00:12:25,028
Cossacks sodomising my cranium.

156
00:12:25,248 --> 00:12:27,550
- Here.
- What's that? A hand grenade?

157
00:12:27,648 --> 00:12:30,825
- Hair of the dog.
- That dog shat on my soul.

158
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:33,007
Drink it. It's mother's
little helper.

159
00:12:33,007 --> 00:12:35,714
My mother left me when I was
three. Fuck my mother.

160
00:12:40,248 --> 00:12:41,424
Oh...

161
00:12:46,247 --> 00:12:48,232
Fuck, I'm dying.

162
00:12:48,647 --> 00:12:51,069
I'm dying. I'm gonna
die on this train.

163
00:12:51,127 --> 00:12:53,953
If dying on this train will
shut you up, I'm all for it.

164
00:12:54,087 --> 00:12:56,226
Some fucking friend you are.

165
00:12:57,847 --> 00:13:01,085
You can't make up for 12
years in three days, Dom.

166
00:13:01,086 --> 00:13:02,744
Well, I tried.

167
00:13:08,046 --> 00:13:10,709
I fucking tried.

168
00:13:25,966 --> 00:13:27,067
Mr Hemingway?

169
00:13:27,446 --> 00:13:28,845
Mr Dom Hemingway?

170
00:13:28,846 --> 00:13:29,903
What?

171
00:13:29,966 --> 00:13:32,946
I've been sent by Monsieur
Fontaine. Follow me.

172
00:13:33,645 --> 00:13:34,702
Oi, lardo!

173
00:13:35,085 --> 00:13:38,032
If you're sent by Mr Fontaine,
then carry my fucking bag.

174
00:13:39,605 --> 00:13:42,104
Someone's feeling
his old self again.

175
00:13:42,685 --> 00:13:45,862
Damn right. Now let's go
get my fucking money.

176
00:13:55,045 --> 00:13:57,664
It's interesting, the
French countryside.

177
00:13:58,084 --> 00:14:01,261
Looks like a barmaid's snatch
after a Cup Final weekend.

178
00:14:05,364 --> 00:14:08,071
Fontaine better have
a well-stocked bar.

179
00:14:08,124 --> 00:14:11,683
He was raised in a Russian orphanage
and kills people for a living.

180
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,347
Of course he has a
well-stocked bar.

181
00:14:42,962 --> 00:14:44,860
South of France.

182
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:01,980
Afternoon.

183
00:15:10,801 --> 00:15:12,819
Dom, don't think what
you're thinking.

184
00:15:12,841 --> 00:15:14,947
That's Mr Fontaine's property.

185
00:15:15,521 --> 00:15:17,520
Property is a relative
term for a thief.

186
00:15:17,521 --> 00:15:20,020
- Still.
- I'm just looking.

187
00:15:21,641 --> 00:15:22,905
Admiring.

188
00:15:23,081 --> 00:15:25,360
- She's rather fit.
- Not her, not Paolina.

189
00:15:25,361 --> 00:15:27,860
- Fit to fiddle, I'd say.
- Dom!

190
00:15:28,241 --> 00:15:30,280
- You don't admire that.
- Bugger off, Dickie.

191
00:15:30,281 --> 00:15:33,817
I'll admire what I wanna admire,
think what I wanna think.

192
00:15:35,961 --> 00:15:38,504
Fiddle who I wanna fiddle.

193
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,786
Domingo Hemingway!

194
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,102
As I live and breathe,

195
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,307
the Ghost of Christmas Past.

196
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,145
Mr Fontaine.

197
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,359
Call me Ivan. Are you crazy?

198
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,999
Ivan Anatolivich Fontanov,
like the old days.

199
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,581
I never called you Ivan
Anatoli in the old days.

200
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,262
Well, you will now.

201
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:09,457
Do you hunt, Dom?

202
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,742
No, I don't, Ivan.

203
00:16:12,359 --> 00:16:14,318
I only use a gun to
hold up a place,

204
00:16:14,319 --> 00:16:17,266
or threaten someone, or rob 'em,

205
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:19,678
or pistol-whip 'em, or scare 'em.

206
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,981
- But, no, no hunting.
- Shame.

207
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:24,380
It is the sport of princes.

208
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:26,938
Well, I'm a peasant at heart.

209
00:16:27,118 --> 00:16:31,977
A petty serf with nice
hair and a strong liver.

210
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:38,178
I'll eat what you hunt,
unless it's rabbit.

211
00:16:38,278 --> 00:16:40,176
Rabbits are pets. I don't eat pets.

212
00:16:40,238 --> 00:16:42,757
Oh, these French rabbits are
something else, though, Dom.

213
00:16:42,758 --> 00:16:44,077
I think you'll like 'em.

214
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:45,823
They taste like a revolution.

215
00:16:46,158 --> 00:16:48,176
If that's an advert,
I'm not sure it's working.

216
00:16:50,157 --> 00:16:51,903
It's good to see you, Dom.

217
00:16:58,557 --> 00:16:59,898
Dom Hemingway is free!

218
00:17:00,318 --> 00:17:02,436
Dom Hemingway is free!

219
00:17:03,677 --> 00:17:06,220
Dom Hemingway is free!

220
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,982
You look good, Dom, you really do.

221
00:17:27,077 --> 00:17:29,315
Well, what can I say?
I'm an handsome fucker.

222
00:17:32,716 --> 00:17:36,613
I see you've retained your vanity
and your sense of humour.

223
00:17:37,596 --> 00:17:39,298
Lefty was right.

224
00:17:40,156 --> 00:17:43,299
- Lefty?
- Yeah, Lefty, he was right.

225
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,893
- Who's Lefty?
- Who's Lefty?

226
00:17:47,395 --> 00:17:49,097
You serious, Dom?

227
00:17:49,475 --> 00:17:50,893
You blind?

228
00:17:51,155 --> 00:17:52,781
You lost your eyesight in prison?

229
00:17:53,075 --> 00:17:54,114
What?

230
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:57,816
Lefty! Lefty, your best friend,
Dickie, with one fucking hand.

231
00:18:00,595 --> 00:18:01,772
You lost your hand?

232
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,256
Yeah, 'course.

233
00:18:04,635 --> 00:18:06,140
You lost your bloody hand?

234
00:18:06,834 --> 00:18:08,055
Yes, Dom.

235
00:18:08,235 --> 00:18:10,581
Why do you think I'm wearing
this black glove all the time?

236
00:18:11,235 --> 00:18:13,212
I thought it was a fashion
statement or something.

237
00:18:14,674 --> 00:18:15,939
Fashion statement?

238
00:18:16,074 --> 00:18:18,473
I've been in fucking prison
12 years. I missed a few things.

239
00:18:18,474 --> 00:18:20,492
I thought it was the latest
fashion. I don't know!

240
00:18:20,594 --> 00:18:24,218
You always were a bit of a clothes fag.
You lost your fucking hand?

241
00:18:24,794 --> 00:18:27,654
It was shot off three
years ago during a job.

242
00:18:28,074 --> 00:18:29,433
How do I not know that?

243
00:18:29,434 --> 00:18:32,294
They found his fingers strewn
all over the high street.

244
00:18:33,034 --> 00:18:34,856
Fucking hell, Dickie. I'm sorry.

245
00:18:35,434 --> 00:18:37,513
I'm good, Dom. It's all good.

246
00:18:37,514 --> 00:18:40,417
Yeah, Dickie's a good soldier.

247
00:18:40,433 --> 00:18:42,451
Mmm, tough guy.

248
00:18:43,553 --> 00:18:45,255
Stand-up man.

249
00:18:46,273 --> 00:18:47,854
So are you, Dom.

250
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:50,211
The most stand-up man
I have ever met.

251
00:18:52,313 --> 00:18:53,850
- Dom is that.
- Yeah.

252
00:18:54,153 --> 00:18:56,816
Well, a rat is a rat
and a teat is a tit.

253
00:18:57,193 --> 00:19:00,140
Still, others would have broken.

254
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:03,711
Those are others,
not Dom Hemingway.

255
00:19:03,712 --> 00:19:06,331
- No, not you.
- Not me.

256
00:19:15,872 --> 00:19:19,528
You've done all right for yourself
the last 12 years, Mr Fontaine.

257
00:19:19,632 --> 00:19:21,257
Ivan, please.

258
00:19:21,351 --> 00:19:24,211
Ivan. You've done all
right for yourself.

259
00:19:24,992 --> 00:19:28,047
The art, the house.

260
00:19:28,512 --> 00:19:32,390
Or estate. This is an estate, right?
That's what they call it. It's very nice.

261
00:19:32,391 --> 00:19:34,890
It's a villa, Dom, a holiday home.

262
00:19:35,472 --> 00:19:37,970
But thank you, thank you.
I appreciate it.

263
00:19:40,271 --> 00:19:42,650
Is Ivan short for Ivana?

264
00:19:45,991 --> 00:19:48,894
No, just Ivan.

265
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,135
Could be Ivana, though, right?

266
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:57,047
It's Ivan, Ivan
Anatolivich Fontanov.

267
00:19:58,511 --> 00:20:02,451
Ivan, sorry. Ivan. Sorry.

268
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:04,251
It's OK.

269
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:06,928
I could have ratted.

270
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:09,215
I could have mentioned your name.

271
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:13,109
I could have said Ivana Anatoli
Fontaine was the leader of the group.

272
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:15,309
Maybe you are tired
from your trip, Dom?

273
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:18,269
I kept my mouth shut and
I sat in that tiny cell

274
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:21,609
while my wife died of cancer in the
arms of some other fucking bloke.

275
00:20:21,749 --> 00:20:23,615
I've heard about
that and I'm sorry.

276
00:20:24,229 --> 00:20:25,749
- Sorry?
- I'm sorry.

277
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,108
- Try 12 years.
- I'm sorry, Dom...

278
00:20:27,109 --> 00:20:29,388
12 fucking years. Missed
my Evelyn growing up.

279
00:20:29,389 --> 00:20:31,407
I said I'm sorry.

280
00:20:31,509 --> 00:20:34,108
- Words are easy.
- And it's all I have.

281
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:36,848
- You have something else.
- You are due and you will be paid.

282
00:20:37,068 --> 00:20:38,708
- Plus interest.
- Plus interest.

283
00:20:38,709 --> 00:20:40,411
Plus a present.

284
00:20:41,109 --> 00:20:43,215
- Present?
- For being so quiet.

285
00:20:43,548 --> 00:20:46,467
Those girls were a present.
Did you like them, Dom, huh'?

286
00:20:46,468 --> 00:20:48,147
The coke and the girls,
that was a present.

287
00:20:48,148 --> 00:20:52,613
Oh, you really think two birds and a
bit of blow are a worthy present?

288
00:20:53,108 --> 00:20:55,187
- After what I done for you?
- I was not suggesting...

289
00:20:55,188 --> 00:20:57,667
Cos that don't even come close
to a present, not even close.

290
00:20:57,668 --> 00:21:00,547
It's not even a stocking stuffer,
barely an opening act.

291
00:21:00,548 --> 00:21:03,604
<i>Barely a fucking appetiser,
barely an amuse-bouche.</i>

292
00:21:03,707 --> 00:21:07,467
It's nothing. It's nothing but a bit
of confetti in my ticker-tape parade,

293
00:21:07,468 --> 00:21:10,226
and I want the full fucking parade.

294
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:12,427
My ticker-tape parade, Ivana.

295
00:21:12,428 --> 00:21:15,146
I want the fucking band.
I want the fucking float.

296
00:21:15,147 --> 00:21:17,707
I want the parade, the float,
the band and what you owe me.

297
00:21:17,707 --> 00:21:21,364
What you owe me
is what I fucking want!

298
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:25,810
I said, you'll get what is yours.

299
00:21:25,987 --> 00:21:28,049
Plus a fucking present!

300
00:21:28,627 --> 00:21:30,386
- A real present.
- OK, Dom...

301
00:21:30,387 --> 00:21:32,613
Let's say, your girlfriend.

302
00:21:34,347 --> 00:21:36,017
The one with the bicycle.
What's her name?

303
00:21:37,106 --> 00:21:39,265
Paolina? I want her.

304
00:21:39,266 --> 00:21:41,185
Don't be crazy, Dom.

305
00:21:44,906 --> 00:21:46,425
I'm not crazy.

306
00:21:46,426 --> 00:21:48,905
I want her, naked,
like she likes it,

307
00:21:48,906 --> 00:21:50,385
with a little red
bow on her clitoris

308
00:21:50,386 --> 00:21:53,384
- for me to untie with my teeth.
- Enough. The joke is over.

309
00:21:53,385 --> 00:21:55,465
- I think you should sober up, OK?
- Joke's on you, Ivana.

310
00:21:55,466 --> 00:21:58,850
- Go rest. We'll see you at dinner.
- Ivana Anal-toli.

311
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:06,185
I have been nothing but polite.

312
00:22:06,186 --> 00:22:09,184
Polite? Polite! Aren't
you the bee's knees?

313
00:22:09,185 --> 00:22:10,330
Cunt.

314
00:22:10,785 --> 00:22:12,170
Fucker.

315
00:22:13,225 --> 00:22:14,489
Cunt.

316
00:22:22,345 --> 00:22:24,603
You don't want me to get rough.

317
00:22:24,665 --> 00:22:25,744
Trust me, don't go there.

318
00:22:25,745 --> 00:22:27,523
Don't presuppose to
know what I want.

319
00:22:27,704 --> 00:22:29,783
You don't threaten me,
not with that girl's name.

320
00:22:29,784 --> 00:22:31,744
Not with that little
girl's name, Ivana.

321
00:22:31,745 --> 00:22:34,823
Ivana. Ivana? Ivana?
You don't scare me.

322
00:22:34,824 --> 00:22:37,246
You don't fucking
scare me, Anal-toli.

323
00:22:37,304 --> 00:22:39,443
I've seen death. I've seen evil.

324
00:22:39,584 --> 00:22:41,423
I've seen fire. I've seen rain.

325
00:22:41,424 --> 00:22:43,423
I've seen lonely days
I thought would never end.

326
00:22:43,423 --> 00:22:44,982
You don't fucking scare me.

327
00:22:44,983 --> 00:22:48,143
I eye-fuck you. I throat-fuck you!

328
00:22:48,144 --> 00:22:49,782
- Dom!
- Shut it, Dickie!

329
00:22:49,783 --> 00:22:53,484
You one-armed fuck. You freak.
You one-armed fucking fuck freak!

330
00:22:53,543 --> 00:22:57,364
No one's talking to you! No
one's ever talking to you!

331
00:23:17,742 --> 00:23:19,323
I'm fucking bored.

332
00:23:21,382 --> 00:23:23,368
I'm fucking drunk.

333
00:23:25,582 --> 00:23:28,288
I'm fucking drunk and
I'm fucking bored.

334
00:23:29,462 --> 00:23:32,048
I said what I wanted to say.
I said it and you heard it.

335
00:23:32,742 --> 00:23:34,203
Now I'm gonna take a nap.

336
00:23:37,222 --> 00:23:39,524
I'll see you wanks at dinner.

337
00:23:42,501 --> 00:23:45,120
And no fucking rabbit.

338
00:24:05,421 --> 00:24:06,882
Dom, you up?

339
00:24:09,901 --> 00:24:10,958
It's 6:30, it's dinner.

340
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,358
Dom, mate!

341
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,361
Dom?

342
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,718
Jesus Christ.

343
00:24:37,579 --> 00:24:40,001
Dom! Dom!

344
00:24:40,339 --> 00:24:42,538
- Dom, are you fucking mad?
- I screwed it up, Dickie.

345
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:43,738
I screwed everything up.

346
00:24:43,739 --> 00:24:46,446
Really? Cos I thought you
were just mentally retarded.

347
00:24:46,499 --> 00:24:48,378
Like those boys with the
bowl cuts on the telethons.

348
00:24:48,379 --> 00:24:50,698
- Dickie, I'm a mess. Look at me.
- I'm trying not to.

349
00:24:50,699 --> 00:24:54,418
I'm pathetic, I don't belong here.
I'm a monster. I'm a dinosaur.

350
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:57,258
- Don't forget nudist, Dom. Don't forget that!
- I ought to be thrown away.

351
00:24:57,259 --> 00:25:00,137
Sent to a leper colony, forgotten
about, left to rot with the maggots.

352
00:25:00,138 --> 00:25:02,257
Jesus, Dom, you've got to
get control of yourself.

353
00:25:02,258 --> 00:25:04,080
You've got to beg
forgiveness of him.

354
00:25:04,298 --> 00:25:07,441
- You've got to put on trousers.
- I've been locked up for so long, Dickie.

355
00:25:07,698 --> 00:25:09,737
I see the light, the air.

356
00:25:09,738 --> 00:25:12,297
It's been so long since
I breathed clean air.

357
00:25:12,298 --> 00:25:13,577
I look at the clouds, I go nuts.

358
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:16,678
You mix in the whisky, you mix
in the pussy, I go crazy.

359
00:25:16,777 --> 00:25:18,897
I'm a crazy man.
I'm a fucking nutter!

360
00:25:18,898 --> 00:25:21,216
- I mean, I'm afraid to see my own daughter.
- Really?

361
00:25:21,217 --> 00:25:24,120
But not too afraid to insult one of
the most dangerous men in Europe.

362
00:25:24,137 --> 00:25:27,237
Unfortunately, you had
the brass for that one.

363
00:25:32,657 --> 00:25:35,896
He's gonna kill me. I insulted
him in his own villa.

364
00:25:35,897 --> 00:25:38,363
- He'll forgive you.
- He's gonna fucking kill me, Dickie.

365
00:25:38,457 --> 00:25:41,360
He's gonna make Blinis out of
me balls and no one will care.

366
00:25:41,577 --> 00:25:43,415
- Fontaine's not gonna kill you.
- He could.

367
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:45,416
No one would give a toss,
not even me own daughter.

368
00:25:45,417 --> 00:25:47,402
I would give a toss. She would too.

369
00:25:47,417 --> 00:25:50,920
12 years, Dickie, 12 years for
that money and I just blew it.

370
00:25:51,976 --> 00:25:53,394
You apologise to him.

371
00:25:53,536 --> 00:25:56,002
You be a gentleman and
he'll be a gentleman.

372
00:25:56,376 --> 00:25:57,640
It'll be all right.

373
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:01,083
Yeah? You promise?

374
00:26:01,296 --> 00:26:04,455
Yes. But you don't insult his girl.

375
00:26:04,456 --> 00:26:07,135
You don't call him fucking Ivana,
you don't call him Anal-toli

376
00:26:07,136 --> 00:26:08,838
and you don't let him
see your pecker!

377
00:26:09,296 --> 00:26:11,095
You thank your goddamn lucky stars

378
00:26:11,096 --> 00:26:12,895
that he's a kind and gracious man.
Do you understand?

379
00:26:12,896 --> 00:26:13,975
- Yeah...
- Do you understand?

380
00:26:13,976 --> 00:26:16,355
- Yeah.
- Cos I ain't burying your body out here.

381
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:19,635
I'm too fucking old and I
didn't bring the right shoes.

382
00:26:43,694 --> 00:26:45,155
Sorry I'm late.

383
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,797
And sorry I was such a cunt.

384
00:26:54,214 --> 00:26:57,237
You must be Ivan's lady friend.

385
00:27:02,253 --> 00:27:05,113
You're a vision. You're an angel.

386
00:27:07,893 --> 00:27:10,315
Again, Ivan, Mr Fontaine,

387
00:27:10,734 --> 00:27:11,878
sorry.

388
00:27:11,934 --> 00:27:15,994
Me and, er, drink don't
always dance well together.

389
00:27:16,013 --> 00:27:18,152
I acted up. I acted outrageous.

390
00:27:18,653 --> 00:27:19,732
Sorry.

391
00:27:19,733 --> 00:27:23,270
Sorry I'm late for your dinner
and sorry about before.

392
00:27:23,293 --> 00:27:25,071
When you were a cunt?

393
00:27:26,293 --> 00:27:29,076
Yeah, when I was a cunt.

394
00:27:36,732 --> 00:27:40,673
Dom, it is water under the bridge.

395
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:42,513
You are forgiven.

396
00:27:44,212 --> 00:27:46,678
- Thank you.
- Now, sit, sit.

397
00:27:48,612 --> 00:27:51,667
Dinner is ready. The
rabbit is getting cold.

398
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:02,037
Fantastic.

399
00:28:02,531 --> 00:28:04,112
I'm starving.

400
00:28:14,171 --> 00:28:17,675
Everyone sit.
Get comfortable, please.

401
00:28:18,291 --> 00:28:20,670
Because you so enjoyed
the rabbit, Dom,

402
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:23,748
I have a real treat for you.

414
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,673
When I was 14,

415
00:29:29,128 --> 00:29:31,386
my very best friend in the world

416
00:29:31,608 --> 00:29:34,927
was riding his bicycle and
he accidentally crashed

417
00:29:34,928 --> 00:29:37,110
into this girl I liked.

418
00:29:39,048 --> 00:29:41,394
Her name was Tatiana.

419
00:29:41,688 --> 00:29:43,466
We went to school together,

420
00:29:43,927 --> 00:29:46,033
though we hadn't ever talked.

421
00:29:46,487 --> 00:29:48,353
But I liked her from afar.

422
00:29:49,007 --> 00:29:53,866
Anyway, my best friend
accidentally crashed into her.

423
00:29:54,127 --> 00:29:56,112
She got banged up,

424
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:59,984
got a black eye, crying,
the whole thing.

425
00:30:00,647 --> 00:30:05,112
I went over to my friend, took
the bike from him, lifted it up

426
00:30:05,447 --> 00:30:07,509
and smashed it over his head.

427
00:30:09,246 --> 00:30:15,066
Then I stomped on his hand with my
boot until every bone was broken.

428
00:30:15,206 --> 00:30:17,104
Then I took a rock

429
00:30:17,966 --> 00:30:21,021
and smashed it so
hard into his face,

430
00:30:21,126 --> 00:30:23,592
he not only lost most of his teeth

431
00:30:24,325 --> 00:30:26,627
but most of his jaw as well.

432
00:30:28,045 --> 00:30:29,583
This, Dom

433
00:30:30,565 --> 00:30:33,885
is what I did to my best friend
for having a fucking accident

434
00:30:33,886 --> 00:30:38,023
involving a girl I hadn't
even ever talked to.

435
00:30:41,725 --> 00:30:42,989
Now,

436
00:30:44,045 --> 00:30:48,826
do you know why I didn't do
anything to you today, Dom?

437
00:30:50,405 --> 00:30:51,746
Do you?

438
00:30:53,724 --> 00:30:55,185
Cos,

439
00:30:56,205 --> 00:30:57,907
you're a kind and gracious man.

440
00:30:59,124 --> 00:31:03,108
Yes, that, but really because

441
00:31:03,884 --> 00:31:08,185
after everything has
been said and done

442
00:31:11,164 --> 00:31:12,942
I do owe you, Dom.

443
00:31:15,884 --> 00:31:18,023
I do owe you.

444
00:31:30,443 --> 00:31:32,822
I'm going to make
right by you, Dom.

445
00:31:40,123 --> 00:31:42,622
- Would you turn around?
- What?

446
00:31:44,323 --> 00:31:46,321
In order to make right,
I need you to turn around.

447
00:31:46,322 --> 00:31:48,340
Oh, yeah, 'course.

448
00:31:50,282 --> 00:31:54,201
I know telling a safe-cracker to
turn around is kind of a funny thing

449
00:31:54,202 --> 00:31:56,624
when you're opening a safe, but...

450
00:32:03,362 --> 00:32:05,107
OK, Dom.

451
00:32:07,761 --> 00:32:10,424
Your share, plus interest.

452
00:32:10,921 --> 00:32:13,628
This is a quarter of
a million pounds.

453
00:32:16,962 --> 00:32:18,226
And this

454
00:32:20,201 --> 00:32:22,219
is another half a million.

455
00:32:24,561 --> 00:32:25,902
This, Dom.

456
00:32:26,801 --> 00:32:28,219
Is your present.

457
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:33,305
Take it. Go on,
take it, it's yours.

458
00:32:53,479 --> 00:32:55,706
Oh, watch out!

459
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:01,662
Oi, oh! Watch out!

460
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:04,421
Ladies.

461
00:33:06,919 --> 00:33:08,741
Here, jump on.

462
00:33:08,999 --> 00:33:10,340
Whoo!

463
00:33:25,479 --> 00:33:26,743
Go, Dom!

464
00:33:58,317 --> 00:34:00,076
You're so bad!

465
00:34:00,077 --> 00:34:01,375
Whoo!

466
00:34:15,597 --> 00:34:17,419
You got a noble chin.

467
00:34:19,196 --> 00:34:23,214
Some people have weak
chins or sad chins.

468
00:34:23,236 --> 00:34:26,696
You got a very sturdy,
very noble chin.

469
00:34:28,876 --> 00:34:33,777
I know it's kind of a weird thing to say.
I mean, to just say out loud.

470
00:34:33,996 --> 00:34:36,835
But my mother told me there's
no better time for a compliment

471
00:34:36,836 --> 00:34:39,018
than the moment you think it, so...

472
00:34:39,116 --> 00:34:42,063
Well, you have very noble breasts.

473
00:34:43,195 --> 00:34:45,234
My name's Melody,

474
00:34:45,235 --> 00:34:48,378
though I've been told
I can't keep a melody.

475
00:34:48,756 --> 00:34:51,222
I'm gonna call you Lisa,
if that's OK with you.

476
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:53,417
Lisa's the name of my cousin.

477
00:34:53,715 --> 00:34:55,417
Yeah, she's an actress.

478
00:34:55,555 --> 00:34:58,141
- I think she did a commercial.
- I acted once.

479
00:34:58,235 --> 00:35:01,816
Played the apothecary in Romeo
and Juliet. Reform school.

480
00:35:01,955 --> 00:35:04,978
I was pretty good, but I didn't
have the stomach for it,

481
00:35:05,315 --> 00:35:08,175
what was needed to
get the good parts.

482
00:35:08,474 --> 00:35:11,314
I didn't wanna have to
service the drama teacher,

483
00:35:11,315 --> 00:35:14,434
if you know what I mean. The
poor bastard who played Romeo,

484
00:35:14,435 --> 00:35:16,901
he was being tossed
since he was 13.

485
00:35:17,114 --> 00:35:20,153
The perv gave him all the good parts
even though he couldn't act a damn

486
00:35:20,154 --> 00:35:24,980
and his skin was volcanic
with pus and pimples.

487
00:35:25,074 --> 00:35:27,453
Ooh, I hate bad skin.

488
00:35:29,754 --> 00:35:33,737
- What's your name, anyway?
- I told you, Melody.

489
00:35:34,393 --> 00:35:39,731
Melody, Melody, with
a face so heavenly.

490
00:35:40,633 --> 00:35:42,312
What about you? What's your name?

491
00:35:42,313 --> 00:35:43,654
Me?

492
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:47,096
I'm Dom. Didn't you know?

493
00:35:47,153 --> 00:35:48,210
Mmm-mmm.

494
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:50,418
I'm Dom Hemingway.

495
00:35:50,713 --> 00:35:52,511
Dom Hemingway.

496
00:35:52,512 --> 00:35:55,952
I am Dom Hemingway!

497
00:36:08,672 --> 00:36:12,777
Oh, listen up, you owls and bears!

498
00:36:13,232 --> 00:36:17,111
You cocksuckers, plebeians
and moral cowards!

499
00:36:17,111 --> 00:36:21,095
You foxes, lions and paedophiles!

500
00:36:21,311 --> 00:36:26,257
Listen up, you freaks,
Philistines and otters!

501
00:36:26,511 --> 00:36:30,271
You queens, queers and
little-girl tears!

502
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:33,731
I am Dom Hemingway!

503
00:36:33,911 --> 00:36:35,510
Dom Hemingway!

504
00:36:35,511 --> 00:36:38,390
And for my years of silence,

505
00:36:38,391 --> 00:36:42,230
I have been granted lordship
over everyone on the planet...

506
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:11,669
12 fucking years
I kept my mouth shut.

507
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:13,189
The most stand-up
man I have ever met...

508
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:15,509
And I sat in that tiny cell
while my wife died of cancer.

509
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:16,829
I do owe you.

510
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:18,468
- Missed my Evelyn growing up.
- I do owe you.

511
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:20,028
- 12 fucking years.
- Dom.

512
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,468
Kept my mouth shut.
Missed my Evelyn growing up.

513
00:37:21,469 --> 00:37:22,748
You are due and you will be paid.

514
00:37:22,749 --> 00:37:24,691
Dom, can you wake up?

515
00:37:26,229 --> 00:37:27,570
Dom.

516
00:37:28,309 --> 00:37:30,054
Dom.

517
00:37:31,149 --> 00:37:32,774
Were you sleeping?

518
00:37:34,189 --> 00:37:36,787
Dom, where is the money?

519
00:37:36,788 --> 00:37:39,167
I want the money.

520
00:37:42,788 --> 00:37:43,845
The money.

521
00:37:46,028 --> 00:37:47,292
Oh...

522
00:37:49,508 --> 00:37:51,286
Oh, fuck.

523
00:37:53,068 --> 00:37:55,447
Oh, the money.

524
00:37:56,588 --> 00:37:58,605
Dom. Dom!

525
00:37:59,587 --> 00:38:02,206
My hand, I've lost my hand.

526
00:38:02,628 --> 00:38:04,613
I've got to find my hand.

527
00:38:09,947 --> 00:38:12,206
I think I have a splinter.

528
00:38:13,828 --> 00:38:14,946
What?

529
00:38:14,947 --> 00:38:17,686
I think I have a splinter in me.

530
00:38:18,787 --> 00:38:20,893
Do you know where Paolina is?

531
00:38:21,347 --> 00:38:23,005
Paolina!

532
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:26,531
I think she might
have some tweezers.

533
00:38:26,826 --> 00:38:27,883
Paolina!

534
00:38:31,587 --> 00:38:33,529
Paolina!

535
00:38:33,586 --> 00:38:37,025
I think I'm just gonna wait
here and rest for a minute.

536
00:38:37,026 --> 00:38:40,562
All right, Ivan. Just rest.
Just rest.

537
00:38:47,506 --> 00:38:48,804
Fuck.

538
00:38:49,025 --> 00:38:51,404
Oh...

539
00:38:52,106 --> 00:38:53,524
Oh!

540
00:39:02,345 --> 00:39:03,402
Girl?

541
00:39:07,945 --> 00:39:09,243
Girl?

542
00:39:11,825 --> 00:39:13,242
Girl!

543
00:39:16,624 --> 00:39:18,522
Come on.

544
00:39:30,904 --> 00:39:32,289
Fucking...

545
00:39:33,584 --> 00:39:35,089
Fuck!

546
00:39:47,544 --> 00:39:49,202
Come on, girl.

547
00:39:49,423 --> 00:39:51,081
Come on, girl.

548
00:39:58,903 --> 00:40:02,123
Come on, girl. Come on!

549
00:40:02,663 --> 00:40:04,485
Come on, girl.

550
00:40:07,823 --> 00:40:08,967
Come on!

551
00:40:13,622 --> 00:40:16,208
Come on. Come on,
my love. Come on.

552
00:40:16,262 --> 00:40:19,045
Come on, love. Come on.
Come on, love.

553
00:40:19,142 --> 00:40:22,798
Come on, my love!
Come on! Come on!

554
00:40:22,822 --> 00:40:23,981
Come on.

555
00:40:26,502 --> 00:40:28,728
Come on, live!

556
00:40:33,582 --> 00:40:34,759
I found it, Dom.

557
00:40:34,902 --> 00:40:37,881
I found my hand. It was hiding
underneath one of the cars.

558
00:40:40,621 --> 00:40:42,803
Good on you, Dickie. Good on ya.

559
00:40:43,021 --> 00:40:45,367
- You saved my life.
- What?

560
00:40:47,461 --> 00:40:49,643
- You saved me.
- Nah.

561
00:40:50,901 --> 00:40:53,280
When you save a person's life,

562
00:40:53,661 --> 00:40:56,460
it means good luck
will smile down on you

563
00:40:56,460 --> 00:41:00,237
when you least expect
it and most need it.

564
00:41:04,941 --> 00:41:06,219
Thank you.

565
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:08,042
I think everybody else is dead.

566
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:10,923
Though I did see Paolina before.

567
00:41:11,181 --> 00:41:13,198
- Heading towards the road.
- The road?

568
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,419
- Towards the villa.
- My money.

569
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:17,819
- What about it?
- You wait here.

570
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:20,078
For the police and the medics.

571
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,880
But we weren't here. You
didn't fucking see us.

572
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:27,838
My money's at the villa.

573
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,978
Fuck me with a javelin!

574
00:41:37,979 --> 00:41:39,938
- Do you have a key?
- Why would I have a key?

575
00:41:39,939 --> 00:41:41,898
I don't know, you could
have asked Mr Fontaine.

576
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:45,359
Mr Fontaine, with a
fender in his stomach?

577
00:41:48,418 --> 00:41:49,956
Poor man's key.

578
00:41:56,018 --> 00:41:57,858
- Where you going?
- To get into dry clothes.

579
00:41:57,859 --> 00:42:00,161
- Where are you going?
- To get my money!

580
00:42:09,258 --> 00:42:11,276
Fucking harlot.

581
00:42:15,858 --> 00:42:19,297
Fucking Romanian fucking harlot.

582
00:42:19,298 --> 00:42:21,176
What are you talking about, Dom?
You're frothing at the mouth.

583
00:42:21,177 --> 00:42:24,320
She come back and she took
my bag with the money.

584
00:42:24,618 --> 00:42:26,680
My fucking money.

585
00:42:27,618 --> 00:42:29,440
Paolina!

586
00:42:30,217 --> 00:42:33,961
Paolina! That was
my money you took!

587
00:42:34,417 --> 00:42:35,922
My money!

588
00:42:35,937 --> 00:42:37,474
Paolina!

589
00:42:41,617 --> 00:42:45,961
That was my money.
Mine, it was mine.

590
00:42:53,456 --> 00:42:55,595
I bled for that money.

591
00:42:57,576 --> 00:43:00,282
I bled for that money.

592
00:43:06,496 --> 00:43:07,837
Dom!

593
00:43:07,975 --> 00:43:09,032
Paolina!

594
00:43:13,576 --> 00:43:14,614
Shit!

595
00:43:14,615 --> 00:43:16,153
Paolina!

596
00:43:21,615 --> 00:43:23,481
Paolina!

597
00:44:25,012 --> 00:44:26,157
What?

598
00:44:33,452 --> 00:44:34,509
Why?

599
00:44:35,812 --> 00:44:39,633
Do I strike you as the type of
woman who wants to be poor?

600
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:25,356
You've gotta be fucking kidding me.

601
00:45:42,649 --> 00:45:44,307
Shh.

602
00:45:53,649 --> 00:45:55,230
What are you talking about?

603
00:45:55,289 --> 00:45:57,711
He says that wound on your
head is going to leave a scar.

604
00:45:58,089 --> 00:45:59,474
He a doctor, is he?

605
00:45:59,569 --> 00:46:01,434
He washes dishes at the
restaurant I work at.

606
00:46:01,929 --> 00:46:03,208
Oh, fucking hell.

607
00:46:04,968 --> 00:46:07,194
But he was a doctor in Senegal.

608
00:46:14,848 --> 00:46:16,808
He also says you are
one ugly bastard.

609
00:46:16,809 --> 00:46:19,087
Well, he's right there, ain't he?

610
00:46:20,608 --> 00:46:22,714
Not sure what happened to
you, but it wasn't pretty.

611
00:46:23,008 --> 00:46:24,426
Misfortune.

612
00:46:26,528 --> 00:46:28,546
Misfortune befell me.

613
00:46:34,727 --> 00:46:37,510
You need to rest now, Dom, OK?

614
00:47:11,646 --> 00:47:14,485
Evelyn said that as soon as
you could pee on two legs,

615
00:47:14,486 --> 00:47:15,707
you'd have to go.

616
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:20,865
By the look of you,
I'd say that's today.

617
00:47:21,165 --> 00:47:23,885
- So she's not talking to me?
- She's at work.

618
00:47:23,886 --> 00:47:27,467
She's just throwing me out,
judge, jury and executioner.

619
00:47:28,365 --> 00:47:29,765
Just like that.

620
00:47:34,485 --> 00:47:36,711
- She hates me.
- She's mad at you.

621
00:47:37,125 --> 00:47:40,564
A lot of years of hurt. That
just doesn't go away like that.

622
00:47:40,565 --> 00:47:43,785
If anyone has the right
to be mad at life, it's me.

623
00:47:43,885 --> 00:47:46,788
I've had the shittiest luck in
the history of shitty luck.

624
00:47:47,405 --> 00:47:49,423
Look at me.

625
00:47:49,844 --> 00:47:51,305
I'm a mess.

626
00:47:53,724 --> 00:47:55,684
Face like an abortion.

627
00:47:55,685 --> 00:47:58,708
Broke as a teenager. Pissing
next to Afrika Bambaataa.

628
00:47:58,724 --> 00:48:00,546
You going there, Dom?

629
00:48:00,884 --> 00:48:02,542
Right. Sorry.

630
00:48:11,164 --> 00:48:12,221
Is that my grandson?

631
00:48:15,523 --> 00:48:18,503
I see your gene's a bit more
prominent, if you know what I mean.

632
00:48:18,563 --> 00:48:19,904
His name's Jawara.

633
00:48:21,163 --> 00:48:23,869
- You're kidding?
- It's Senegalese.

634
00:48:24,163 --> 00:48:27,306
- Diddle me with a voodoo doll.
- It means 'peace-loving'.

635
00:48:30,403 --> 00:48:34,703
I'm Dom. Dom's English for
'unlucky son of a bitch'.

636
00:48:36,882 --> 00:48:40,025
We're playing music tonight,
at Cargo. You know it?

637
00:48:40,242 --> 00:48:43,626
I can't guarantee anything,
but Evelyn will be there.

638
00:48:43,803 --> 00:48:45,985
- So maybe she'll talk with you then.
- You think?

639
00:48:46,602 --> 00:48:49,942
I don't really. But
it's worth a try.

640
00:48:53,242 --> 00:48:54,900
I'm scared.

641
00:48:55,722 --> 00:48:57,303
I would be too.

642
00:48:58,122 --> 00:48:59,824
She's a tough one.

643
00:49:54,200 --> 00:50:00,216

00:51:25,996 --> 00:51:27,621
Bloody fuck.

651
00:51:28,556 --> 00:51:30,435
- You all right, Dom?
- Fucking table.

652
00:51:30,436 --> 00:51:33,555
What's a fucking table doing there?
Anyone can knock into it.

653
00:51:33,556 --> 00:51:36,535
I'm gonna fucking burn
that table, I swear it.

654
00:51:46,995 --> 00:51:49,514
I take it, it didn't
go as planned tonight.

655
00:51:49,515 --> 00:51:51,634
It was just peachy, just peachy.

656
00:51:51,635 --> 00:51:53,394
Like one of them TV shows

657
00:51:53,395 --> 00:51:56,451
where everyone's all huggy
and kissy in the end.

658
00:51:57,315 --> 00:51:59,180
You didn't even say hello, then?

659
00:52:00,355 --> 00:52:01,980
God, I'm a shit.

660
00:52:02,355 --> 00:52:04,074
But you're her shit.

661
00:52:04,075 --> 00:52:06,421
I called her boyfriend
Afrika Bambaataa.

662
00:52:06,595 --> 00:52:08,297
That was smart.

663
00:52:08,635 --> 00:52:10,937
She don't want me, Dickie.

664
00:52:11,474 --> 00:52:13,314
Who can fucking blame her?

665
00:52:13,314 --> 00:52:16,174
Get near me, you're likely to die,

666
00:52:16,954 --> 00:52:19,136
or at least lose all your money.

667
00:52:22,713 --> 00:52:24,459
Oh, yeah, sorry.

668
00:52:29,394 --> 00:52:31,412
This wasn't how it
was supposed to be.

669
00:52:32,473 --> 00:52:33,891
I know.

670
00:52:36,993 --> 00:52:38,531
What are you gonna do, then?

671
00:52:40,233 --> 00:52:44,129
A man with no options suddenly
has all the options in the world.

672
00:52:45,433 --> 00:52:47,832
- What the hell does that mean?
- Don't know.

673
00:52:58,793 --> 00:53:00,178
Doomsday plan.

674
00:53:00,473 --> 00:53:02,655
- I gotta see Lestor Junior.
- No.

675
00:53:02,753 --> 00:53:03,897
Yeah.

676
00:53:03,992 --> 00:53:05,711
- Bugger.
- Fucker.

677
00:53:05,712 --> 00:53:07,894
Shit, Dom. The son's
worse than the father.

678
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:10,054
Yeah. Shit, Dickie.

679
00:53:10,392 --> 00:53:12,814
But Fontaine ain't
exactly hiring, is he?

680
00:53:42,831 --> 00:53:44,412
All right, son?

681
00:53:48,831 --> 00:53:50,669
Dom, Dom Hemingway.

682
00:53:51,790 --> 00:53:53,669
I didn't think I'd recognise you...

683
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:55,589
Seeing as I was barely a
teenager and everything.

684
00:53:55,590 --> 00:53:58,189
- That's right.
- But I did. I'm proud of myself.

685
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:00,869
Fucking hell.

686
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:03,128
Why did you kill my cat, Dom?

687
00:54:05,830 --> 00:54:09,214
You're gonna bring that
up after all these years?

688
00:54:09,749 --> 00:54:12,309
I am. What did that
cat ever do to you?

689
00:54:12,309 --> 00:54:13,549
It was your father's cat, Les.

690
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:15,492
That was your father's cat.
He was competition.

691
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:17,788
No matter. I loved that cat.

692
00:54:17,789 --> 00:54:19,731
That cat was my friend.

693
00:54:20,030 --> 00:54:22,528
Sorry, OK? I'm sorry.

694
00:54:22,789 --> 00:54:23,988
I bet you are.

695
00:54:23,989 --> 00:54:26,668
But you disrespected my cat
and I can't forgive that.

696
00:54:26,669 --> 00:54:28,948
I was just a little boy, you know.

697
00:54:28,949 --> 00:54:31,971
Well, I'm ready to put
the past to rest, huh?

698
00:54:32,188 --> 00:54:33,908
Let bygones be bygones.

699
00:54:33,909 --> 00:54:36,615
Thought maybe we could do
some business together.

700
00:54:36,669 --> 00:54:40,008
You're a killer of cats, Dom,
and I want nothing to do with you.

701
00:54:43,909 --> 00:54:45,053
I said I was sorry.

702
00:54:45,148 --> 00:54:48,248
I know you're sorry, but that
don't bring Bernard back to life.

703
00:54:49,108 --> 00:54:52,547
See, that's what I'm talking about.
Who calls their cat Bernard?

704
00:54:52,548 --> 00:54:54,970
'Course I killed your fucking cat.

705
00:55:03,187 --> 00:55:04,485
Come on.

706
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:07,205
Damn it. Come on!

707
00:55:12,307 --> 00:55:14,609
You know I'm good at what I do.

708
00:55:15,027 --> 00:55:17,026
Your father wanted
me to work for him.

709
00:55:17,027 --> 00:55:20,083
But you never said yes, Dom.
You never said yes.

710
00:55:20,107 --> 00:55:22,386
I worked for Mr Fontaine.
I couldn't say yes.

711
00:55:22,387 --> 00:55:23,785
You could have, but you didn't.

712
00:55:23,786 --> 00:55:25,866
- I didn't cos I couldn't.
- You couldn't cos you wouldn't.

713
00:55:25,867 --> 00:55:27,730
I wouldn't cos I couldn't.
That's why I didn't.

714
00:55:27,787 --> 00:55:30,449
Fuck you! Couldn't,
wouldn't, shouldn't.

715
00:55:32,346 --> 00:55:34,332
I got the magic fingers.

716
00:55:35,147 --> 00:55:36,905
You know that, I always did.

717
00:55:36,906 --> 00:55:38,665
You must remember that.

718
00:55:38,666 --> 00:55:40,265
Magic fingers, Lestor.

719
00:55:40,266 --> 00:55:42,745
You could use that. Your
business could use that.

720
00:55:42,746 --> 00:55:44,185
I run clubs, Dom.

721
00:55:46,585 --> 00:55:48,785
Bullshit, Lestor. You
know what you do.

722
00:55:48,786 --> 00:55:51,569
It's no secret. It's
your family business.

723
00:55:52,186 --> 00:55:54,065
See, there's a part of me

724
00:55:54,065 --> 00:55:56,464
that wants to put you in the
trunk of my sister's Prius,

725
00:55:56,465 --> 00:56:00,105
drive you up to Canvey Island and bury
you up to your thick fucking neck,

726
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:02,528
cover your fat fucking
face in hamburger patties

727
00:56:02,545 --> 00:56:05,664
and let the creatures of the night
eat you to death while I watch.

728
00:56:05,665 --> 00:56:08,264
That's what I want,
you eaten to death

729
00:56:08,265 --> 00:56:11,144
bite by fucking bite,
peck by fucking peck

730
00:56:11,145 --> 00:56:13,611
and fang by motherfucking fang.

731
00:56:16,545 --> 00:56:20,409
See, I heard Belly retired and
his replacement's disappointing.

732
00:56:21,345 --> 00:56:23,663
So you come to the son of the
man you was at war with?

733
00:56:23,664 --> 00:56:24,704
He was competition.

734
00:56:24,705 --> 00:56:28,103
You come to the little boy
whose pussy cat you murdered?

735
00:56:28,104 --> 00:56:29,522
You need me, Lestor.

736
00:56:30,184 --> 00:56:33,164
You're an old man, Dom.
You should retire, too.

737
00:56:38,903 --> 00:56:40,321
I meant to.

738
00:56:40,544 --> 00:56:42,529
Yeah, I bet you did.

739
00:57:18,103 --> 00:57:19,488
It's not like the old days, Dom.

740
00:57:19,982 --> 00:57:22,044
They've got electronics now.

741
00:57:24,862 --> 00:57:26,247
A safe's a safe.

742
00:57:26,462 --> 00:57:28,480
Until you can't open it.

743
00:57:29,262 --> 00:57:31,641
Come by my club tonight at 11:00.

744
00:57:31,782 --> 00:57:33,123
Sugarfix.

745
00:57:33,182 --> 00:57:35,199
I have a new electronic safe there.

746
00:57:35,262 --> 00:57:38,340
If you can open it in 10 minutes,
you can come and work for me,

747
00:57:38,341 --> 00:57:40,087
bygones be bygones.

748
00:57:40,422 --> 00:57:42,380
I'll have plenty of
solid business for you.

749
00:57:42,381 --> 00:57:44,924
However, if you can't open it,

750
00:57:45,141 --> 00:57:47,967
I'm gonna chop off your tiny
dick and use it as a doorjamb.

751
00:57:50,301 --> 00:57:53,007
It's your call, Dom.
Show up or not.

752
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:55,678
Open the safe or not.

753
00:57:56,021 --> 00:57:58,247
Piss standing up again or not.

754
00:57:58,421 --> 00:58:01,476
Those are your options.
Those are your choices.

755
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:05,166
And that was for Bernard.

756
00:58:07,421 --> 00:58:10,019
- I thought that's what the last one was for.
- Nah, nah, nah.

757
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:12,038
That was for my daddy.
This one is for Bernard.

758
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:14,019
He was a good fucking cat

759
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:16,459
and didn't deserve your ugly face
to be the last thing he saw.

760
00:58:34,099 --> 00:58:35,680
Thanks, Jeanie.

761
00:58:38,139 --> 00:58:40,418
Are you sure you should be
drinking like this, Dom?

762
00:58:40,419 --> 00:58:41,717
I'm good, Mum.

763
00:58:42,619 --> 00:58:44,058
I'm serious.

764
00:58:44,058 --> 00:58:46,898
You've got to open a safe later and
you haven't opened one in 12 years.

765
00:58:46,899 --> 00:58:49,846
I'm steady as a trapeze
artist's cunt.

766
00:58:50,658 --> 00:58:52,643
- Let me see your hand.
- What?

767
00:58:52,698 --> 00:58:55,875
Your hand. I want to see
if you're really steady.

768
00:58:56,058 --> 00:58:59,018
Look at your own hand, Dickie,
if you haven't lost it again.

769
00:59:01,178 --> 00:59:04,562
Seriously, put out your hand,
Dom. Let me see it.

770
00:59:07,098 --> 00:59:08,154
Fucker.

771
00:59:09,218 --> 00:59:10,977
I could do surgery with this hand,

772
00:59:10,978 --> 00:59:13,377
operate on your caper-sized brain,

773
00:59:13,378 --> 00:59:15,996
finger a nun from five feet away.

774
00:59:16,217 --> 00:59:18,136
That safe don't scare me.

775
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:21,434
Lestor McGreevy don't scare me.
Nothing scares me.

776
00:59:21,818 --> 00:59:24,601
Well, you're scaring me,
that much is true.

777
00:59:25,257 --> 00:59:26,762
I'm good.

778
00:59:27,857 --> 00:59:30,880
You're penniless, homeless. You're
fast on your way to being pissed.

779
00:59:31,577 --> 00:59:33,336
Your wank's on the line

780
00:59:33,337 --> 00:59:35,923
and you haven't opened
a safe in 12 years,

781
00:59:35,937 --> 00:59:38,239
and not an electronic
one, not ever.

782
00:59:38,296 --> 00:59:40,736
Aren't you the Easter
Bunny, hopping around,

783
00:59:40,737 --> 00:59:42,799
spreading good cheer
wherever you go?

784
00:59:43,576 --> 00:59:45,441
I'm just stating what I'm stating.

785
00:59:45,577 --> 00:59:49,095
- Stop stating what you're stating.
- I'm not gonna stop stating it.

786
00:59:49,096 --> 00:59:50,994
I'll state what I want to state
in whatever state I want to.

787
00:59:51,016 --> 00:59:52,718
State it again, I'll
knock your teeth out.

788
00:59:52,736 --> 00:59:54,375
Knock my teeth out,
I'll cut your ear off.

789
00:59:54,376 --> 00:59:56,855
Cut my ear off, I'll carve
your eye out with my big toe.

790
00:59:56,856 --> 00:59:57,895
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

791
00:59:57,896 --> 00:59:58,953
Fuck you.

792
01:00:00,135 --> 01:00:02,602
You think I ain't gonna
be able to do this?

793
01:00:03,015 --> 01:00:04,934
Me, Dom Hemingway?
Think I can't do this?

794
01:00:04,935 --> 01:00:08,414
There hasn't been a safe I
ain't been able to open, ever.

795
01:00:08,415 --> 01:00:11,558
When I was four months old, I could
open a safe from my fucking pram.

796
01:00:11,895 --> 01:00:13,760
I'm just saying.

797
01:00:14,415 --> 01:00:16,117
Don't say nothing.

798
01:00:20,255 --> 01:00:23,278
I'm gonna do this, Dickie.
I'm gonna do this.

799
01:00:25,655 --> 01:00:27,520
I got no other choice.

800
01:00:56,854 --> 01:00:59,733
State of the art. Had it
installed four months ago.

801
01:00:59,734 --> 01:01:02,277
- Made in Japan.
- I'm big in Japan.

802
01:01:03,373 --> 01:01:06,453
You have 10 minutes. Do you
want me to start the timing now?

803
01:01:06,454 --> 01:01:10,197
Or do you want to say a little
prayer for your friend Tiny first?

804
01:01:10,213 --> 01:01:12,756
I just want another pint.
Is that OK?

805
01:01:13,253 --> 01:01:15,512
Another drink before we start.

806
01:01:16,253 --> 01:01:18,599
Have all the beer you want, Dom.

807
01:02:12,490 --> 01:02:14,432
Right, let's get started.

808
01:02:15,451 --> 01:02:17,289
Clock says 11:35.

809
01:02:17,290 --> 01:02:19,909
It means you have until 11:45.

810
01:02:20,090 --> 01:02:22,709
Easy-peasy lemon squeezy.

811
01:02:29,610 --> 01:02:31,028
What the fuck is that?

812
01:02:31,090 --> 01:02:32,551
Equipment.

813
01:02:36,009 --> 01:02:37,515
Bloody hell!

814
01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:40,629
Fuck you and fuck your cat.

815
01:02:40,689 --> 01:02:44,750
I said, open my safe,
not destroy my office.

816
01:02:44,769 --> 01:02:47,749
Fuck your office, fuck you,

817
01:02:47,809 --> 01:02:50,515
fuck your father and fuck your cat.

818
01:02:50,529 --> 01:02:54,065
In nine minutes your balls
are becoming trinkets.

819
01:02:54,089 --> 01:02:58,314
Fuck your trinkets, fuck
your cat, fuck your father,

820
01:02:58,369 --> 01:03:00,988
fuck your office and fuck you!

821
01:03:15,768 --> 01:03:18,007
Not sure what you can do
in the time you have left,

822
01:03:18,008 --> 01:03:19,393
except maybe have a heart attack.

823
01:03:19,528 --> 01:03:21,274
I got to do a piss.

824
01:03:21,488 --> 01:03:24,194
- What?
- Piss. I got to.

825
01:03:24,208 --> 01:03:26,286
I'm not stopping the clock.

826
01:03:26,287 --> 01:03:29,234
'Course you aren't.
You're pond scum, Lestor.

827
01:03:29,287 --> 01:03:31,206
Garbage, refuse.

828
01:03:31,207 --> 01:03:33,629
Your father was a class
act compared to you.

829
01:03:33,688 --> 01:03:37,628
You're shit on my shoe.
You're a cunt in gold chains.

830
01:03:37,648 --> 01:03:41,665
A misery in size 10 Adidas. Now,
where's your fucking toilet?

831
01:03:47,447 --> 01:03:51,464
- Who designed this place, anyway?
- I did, actually.

832
01:03:51,567 --> 01:03:54,245
It's like a brothel
by way of Elton John.

833
01:03:54,246 --> 01:03:56,231
Stick to thieving and nepotism.

834
01:04:02,766 --> 01:04:03,987
What are you looking at?

835
01:04:07,926 --> 01:04:09,344
Five minutes left, Dom.

836
01:04:09,486 --> 01:04:11,925
Might be the last time
you piss standing up.

837
01:04:11,926 --> 01:04:15,222
I assume the cables in
the back of the safe

838
01:04:15,686 --> 01:04:18,272
are attached to some
security company.

839
01:04:18,326 --> 01:04:20,792
Yes. They promised a
five-minute response.

840
01:04:20,966 --> 01:04:22,885
I promised not to come
in your sister's mouth.

841
01:04:22,886 --> 01:04:25,045
We all make promises we can't keep.

842
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:39,469
Don't worry, I'm not gonna
do anything to Lestor,

843
01:04:39,565 --> 01:04:41,671
as tempting as that may be.

844
01:05:01,284 --> 01:05:02,702
Four minutes,

845
01:05:02,804 --> 01:05:04,923
or less if security comes.

846
01:05:04,924 --> 01:05:09,028
The fastest fingers guy I ever saw took
10, 12 minutes with a safe like this,

847
01:05:09,044 --> 01:05:11,522
and he had state-of-the-art
equipment with him.

848
01:05:11,523 --> 01:05:14,983
- I ain't like most finger guys.
- No, you're not.

849
01:05:15,204 --> 01:05:17,102
- You're old.
- I'm old-school.

850
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:19,181
Old, old-school, same thing.

851
01:05:19,203 --> 01:05:22,379
I got magic fingers,
Lestor. I told you.

852
01:05:23,443 --> 01:05:24,500
So?

853
01:05:26,643 --> 01:05:28,028
So...

854
01:05:35,083 --> 01:05:36,424
Whoa!

855
01:05:37,363 --> 01:05:38,868
Yeah, yeah...

856
01:05:40,043 --> 01:05:43,066
- What the hell are you doing, man?
- Fuck you.

857
01:05:43,163 --> 01:05:46,983
You trying to screw the safe, Dom,
or are you trying to impregnate it?

858
01:05:47,242 --> 01:05:48,824
Do you want me to get
you guys a room?

859
01:05:50,322 --> 01:05:52,307
Seriously, what the hell
are you doing, man?

860
01:05:52,322 --> 01:05:53,641
I'm winning the bet.

861
01:05:53,642 --> 01:05:55,907
Japs sold you a cheap safe
and he's gonna win because of it.

862
01:05:56,202 --> 01:05:57,960
It wasn't fucking cheap.

863
01:05:57,961 --> 01:06:00,401
Then you got ripped off, Lestor.

864
01:06:00,402 --> 01:06:01,623
Fucking ripped off.

865
01:06:02,401 --> 01:06:03,840
Ha, ha, ha!

866
01:06:03,841 --> 01:06:05,601
So what's he trying to do, Dickie?

867
01:06:05,602 --> 01:06:08,040
Most safes, the cheap ones
at least, like yours,

868
01:06:08,041 --> 01:06:10,680
if you bounce them enough, there's
a moment when the pins are shaken

869
01:06:10,681 --> 01:06:12,787
and not lined up, even
the electronic ones.

870
01:06:12,801 --> 01:06:15,584
If you're pulling the handle
at that moment, it opens.

871
01:06:15,641 --> 01:06:18,720
Well, nothing's happening here
except Dom getting a fucking hernia.

872
01:06:18,721 --> 01:06:22,978
And you've only got two...
No, one minute and 55 seconds left.

873
01:06:23,001 --> 01:06:25,861
<i>♪ God save</i>

874
01:06:26,241 --> 01:06:29,985
<i>♪ The Queen ♪</i>

875
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:37,785
Pints are on me!

876
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:42,743
And that, my friends,

877
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:45,102
is how you open a safe.

878
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:47,226
You did it, Dom. You right did it.

879
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:49,678
I knew I would. I told you I would.

880
01:06:49,679 --> 01:06:52,639
I knew I'd beat this
arsehole at his own game

881
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:55,479
and prove to him what the
world already knows,

882
01:06:55,479 --> 01:07:01,266
that Dom Hemingway is the greatest
safe cracker known to mankind.

883
01:07:01,359 --> 01:07:03,858
That I am a legend, a myth.

884
01:07:04,119 --> 01:07:09,098
A glorious tale to be handed down
from generation to generation.

885
01:07:09,279 --> 01:07:11,778
I am impressed, Dom, I must say.

886
01:07:11,839 --> 01:07:14,982
Fucking right, Lestor, Chestor,

887
01:07:15,079 --> 01:07:18,438
Chestor the molester, Uncle Fester.

888
01:07:18,439 --> 01:07:20,238
And only 52 seconds left.

889
01:07:20,239 --> 01:07:23,863
Exactly, Fester the
fucking court jester.

890
01:07:23,918 --> 01:07:26,461
I won the bet. You owe me work.

891
01:07:26,599 --> 01:07:28,376
Big-paying work.

892
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:31,585
Actually, you didn't win the bet.

893
01:07:35,998 --> 01:07:37,262
What are you talking about?

894
01:07:37,917 --> 01:07:42,339
I'm saying, in 30 seconds
I'm cutting Little Dom off.

895
01:07:42,438 --> 01:07:44,664
I opened your safe.

896
01:07:44,757 --> 01:07:46,819
You opened a safe.

897
01:07:47,077 --> 01:07:50,316
But my safe, my safe is this.

898
01:07:50,317 --> 01:07:52,619
You have eight seconds
to open it, seven...

899
01:07:52,638 --> 01:07:54,535
- That ain't fair.
- Fuck fair, it's the bet.

900
01:07:54,677 --> 01:07:57,340
Five, four, three,

901
01:07:57,477 --> 01:07:59,036
two, one.

902
01:08:05,917 --> 01:08:07,662
Poor Dom Hemingway.

903
01:08:08,516 --> 01:08:10,938
Poor, poor Dom Hemingway.

904
01:08:11,916 --> 01:08:16,054
All that time in prison, only to
come out and be humiliated

905
01:08:16,196 --> 01:08:19,143
by the son of the man
he always hated.

906
01:08:23,556 --> 01:08:25,635
You're not really gonna do
what you're saying, Lestor?

907
01:08:25,636 --> 01:08:27,075
If I were you,
I'd keep quiet, Dickie.

908
01:08:27,076 --> 01:08:30,340
You know I'll kill you too
and no one will give a shit.

909
01:08:30,355 --> 01:08:32,734
- Now, take off your trousers.
- Come on.

910
01:08:34,075 --> 01:08:36,181
- Lestor.
- I'm serious.

911
01:08:38,515 --> 01:08:40,413
Aw, fuck!

912
01:08:44,155 --> 01:08:46,938
A deal's a deal, a bet's a bet

913
01:08:47,155 --> 01:08:49,173
and a dick doorstop
is a dick doorstop.

914
01:08:49,635 --> 01:08:51,173
Lestor, come on.

915
01:08:51,315 --> 01:08:54,371
I hate you, Dom. I always
have. You killed Bernard.

916
01:08:54,515 --> 01:08:58,193
You can't out off my dick
because of a fucking cat.

917
01:08:58,194 --> 01:09:00,016
- Yes, I can.
- No, you can't.

918
01:09:00,675 --> 01:09:03,895
OK, no, I can't, you're right,
but I can cut it off

919
01:09:04,194 --> 01:09:07,193
cos you said you could open my
safe in 10 minutes and you didn't.

920
01:09:07,194 --> 01:09:09,016
- You rigged the bet.
- Semantics.

921
01:09:09,114 --> 01:09:12,753
- I played by the rules.
- People are dirty, Dom. You should know that.

922
01:09:12,754 --> 01:09:14,335
But I played by the rules.

923
01:09:14,674 --> 01:09:16,433
That's your problem.

924
01:09:16,434 --> 01:09:18,113
You're a fucking criminal.

925
01:09:18,114 --> 01:09:19,913
Criminals don't have rules.

926
01:09:19,913 --> 01:09:22,052
There's a code of ethics. There is!

927
01:09:22,874 --> 01:09:25,072
And where did that code get you?

928
01:09:25,073 --> 01:09:29,752
12 years alone, a dead wife
and a daughter who hates you.

929
01:09:29,753 --> 01:09:31,334
You don't know!

930
01:09:32,393 --> 01:09:34,291
Everyone knows.

931
01:09:37,353 --> 01:09:40,061
You played by the rules in jail and
you got screwed when you got out.

932
01:09:40,793 --> 01:09:44,177
You played by the rules here
and you got screwed here.

933
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:49,335
You're a dumb criminal,
Dom. A dumb man.

934
01:09:50,872 --> 01:09:52,592
Now take off your trousers.

935
01:09:55,873 --> 01:09:57,137
Lestor.

936
01:09:57,712 --> 01:09:59,010
Now.

937
01:10:18,231 --> 01:10:19,452
Now!

938
01:10:34,671 --> 01:10:36,208
Safe security.

939
01:11:01,309 --> 01:11:04,365
- I'll meet you at the place near the place.
- Right.

940
01:11:20,429 --> 01:11:22,535
You can't fucking catch me.

941
01:11:34,188 --> 01:11:36,867
Oh, fu... Oh, fuck...

942
01:11:36,868 --> 01:11:38,526
Oh, fuck...

943
01:12:28,586 --> 01:12:31,085
Hey, you lot need a back-up
singer, I am available.

944
01:12:44,745 --> 01:12:46,086
What do you want, then?

945
01:12:46,785 --> 01:12:49,448
What? Nothing. I just
wanna say hello.

946
01:12:50,426 --> 01:12:53,345
You look like shit, but at least you're
standing up. That's an improvement.

947
01:12:53,346 --> 01:12:55,288
Yeah, I got that going.

948
01:12:56,826 --> 01:13:00,024
Tell me something, Dom. You know
how old I was when you went away?

949
01:13:00,025 --> 01:13:03,384
Can your fogged-up, whisky-soaked
brain go back that far?

950
01:13:03,385 --> 01:13:04,923
Yeah, 'course.

951
01:13:05,585 --> 01:13:07,384
I remember being in my room

952
01:13:07,385 --> 01:13:10,016
and hearing mum yelling at you when
you left. Do you remember that?

953
01:13:10,985 --> 01:13:15,046
She was just pleading, begging
with you to strike a deal.

954
01:13:15,985 --> 01:13:19,663
If you'd have testified, you'd
have got two, maybe three years.

955
01:13:19,664 --> 01:13:21,983
You'd have been out
before I was 13,

956
01:13:21,984 --> 01:13:25,007
before mum got sick,
before mum died.

957
01:13:25,944 --> 01:13:27,823
I wanna make up for lost time.
That's why I'm here.

958
01:13:27,824 --> 01:13:29,122
I don't.

959
01:13:30,944 --> 01:13:33,530
Come on, now. I made a mistake.

960
01:13:34,464 --> 01:13:37,343
I'm a fucker and I'm a failure.

961
01:13:37,344 --> 01:13:39,863
Oh, Dom, I'm leaving.
I have to go. I...

962
01:13:39,864 --> 01:13:42,690
I don't want you coming
round here any more.

963
01:13:43,024 --> 01:13:46,680
I don't want you coming round
my house or my son, OK?

964
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:49,642
I don't want to see you.

965
01:13:54,583 --> 01:13:56,942
You have done very little
for me in my life, Dom.

966
01:13:56,943 --> 01:13:59,606
Please, just do that.

967
01:14:00,702 --> 01:14:03,758
It's Dad. It's Dad. It's not Dom.

968
01:14:14,103 --> 01:14:15,367
Evie.

969
01:14:19,702 --> 01:14:21,327
What, Dom?

970
01:14:22,262 --> 01:14:24,821
I'm gonna go and see your
mum's grave tomorrow morning.

971
01:14:24,821 --> 01:14:28,205
I wondered if you wanted
to come. I ain't seen it yet.

972
01:14:31,502 --> 01:14:34,141
What, the grave Sandy
Butterfield paid for,

973
01:14:34,142 --> 01:14:36,007
the guy you beat the shit out of?

974
01:14:37,862 --> 01:14:39,443
Yeah, that one.

975
01:14:40,901 --> 01:14:43,860
I thought it would be
nice if we went together.

976
01:14:43,861 --> 01:14:45,879
You could bring your boy.

977
01:14:45,941 --> 01:14:49,958
You know what would have been
nice? Having a real father.

978
01:14:50,461 --> 01:14:52,523
But I didn't get one, Dom.

979
01:14:52,941 --> 01:14:54,522
I only got you.

980
01:15:31,699 --> 01:15:32,963
Melody.

981
01:15:35,059 --> 01:15:36,116
Wait!

982
01:15:40,139 --> 01:15:41,196
Wait!

983
01:15:44,219 --> 01:15:45,483
Melody!

984
01:15:47,378 --> 01:15:48,435
Melody!

985
01:15:53,498 --> 01:15:55,457
You said I'd have good luck.

986
01:15:55,458 --> 01:15:56,919
Dom Hemingway.

987
01:15:56,978 --> 01:15:59,684
I was so worried about you.

988
01:15:59,938 --> 01:16:01,177
But you're OK.

989
01:16:01,178 --> 01:16:03,297
No, I'm not... I'm not
doing very well, actually.

990
01:16:03,298 --> 01:16:06,457
You said I'd have good luck.
I've had nothing but shitty luck.

991
01:16:06,457 --> 01:16:08,697
I'm so sorry to hear that, Dom.

992
01:16:08,698 --> 01:16:09,897
If I hadn't stopped and helped you,

993
01:16:09,898 --> 01:16:12,758
I'd have had time to save
my money from being stolen.

994
01:16:12,778 --> 01:16:15,758
But you saved my life.
You stopped to save my life.

995
01:16:15,778 --> 01:16:18,277
- I know.
- You did the right thing.

996
01:16:18,457 --> 01:16:20,639
Not everyone would, but you did.

997
01:16:21,058 --> 01:16:24,576
I told you the good luck would
come when you really need it.

998
01:16:24,577 --> 01:16:26,519
Well, I really need it.

999
01:16:26,577 --> 01:16:28,923
- Then it will be.
- How?

1000
01:16:29,497 --> 01:16:31,736
What do you want
most in the world?

1001
01:16:31,737 --> 01:16:33,876
My fucking money!

1002
01:16:35,057 --> 01:16:37,403
- That's what you want most?
- Yes.

1003
01:16:37,457 --> 01:16:39,399
- You sure?
- Yes!

1004
01:16:41,097 --> 01:16:42,799
- Really?
- Yes.

1005
01:16:44,937 --> 01:16:45,994
No.

1006
01:16:53,376 --> 01:16:55,393
I want her to talk to me.

1007
01:16:57,176 --> 01:16:58,594
Forgive me.

1008
01:17:00,575 --> 01:17:02,113
My daughter.

1009
01:17:03,856 --> 01:17:05,361
That seems a little better.

1010
01:17:05,855 --> 01:17:07,360
Yeah, well...

1011
01:17:07,616 --> 01:17:10,855
Just by picking her,
you've already shown

1012
01:17:10,856 --> 01:17:13,639
that the pendulum of luck
is swinging your way.

1013
01:17:13,775 --> 01:17:15,494
What the hell does that mean?

1014
01:17:15,495 --> 01:17:18,234
Love is what you make, Dom.

1015
01:17:33,614 --> 01:17:35,512
Oh, Keethy.

1016
01:17:40,094 --> 01:17:41,959
I fucked up, didn't I?

1017
01:17:44,574 --> 01:17:47,313
And not one of my
minor Dom fuck-ups.

1018
01:17:48,093 --> 01:17:51,433
Like spending all our money
down the pub with Dickie.

1019
01:17:52,934 --> 01:17:56,317
Going out to a football match
and staying away a week.

1020
01:17:57,894 --> 01:18:01,253
Burning down that housing
estate in Leeds by accident.

1021
01:18:03,933 --> 01:18:05,110
No.

1022
01:18:07,413 --> 01:18:09,431
I fucked up royally.

1023
01:18:11,933 --> 01:18:14,432
I didn't get to say goodbye to you.

1024
01:18:16,733 --> 01:18:21,078
I never got to say goodbye and
kiss you goodbye, my sweet girl.

1025
01:18:24,212 --> 01:18:26,212
Now all I got is this dirt,

1026
01:18:26,213 --> 01:18:29,956
fucking grass and dirt in me
hands, and not your sweet face.

1027
01:18:32,252 --> 01:18:34,358
Your sweet, beautiful face.

1028
01:18:42,052 --> 01:18:43,917
I was a stupid fool.

1029
01:18:45,811 --> 01:18:47,316
I lost you.

1030
01:18:49,331 --> 01:18:52,158
I lost out on our
Evelyn's childhood.

1031
01:18:53,692 --> 01:18:56,747
I lost the two most important
things in my life.

1032
01:18:58,451 --> 01:19:00,316
And now you're gone...

1033
01:19:01,531 --> 01:19:03,396
and our Evie...

1034
01:19:06,171 --> 01:19:07,796
she hates me.

1035
01:19:12,250 --> 01:19:13,953
Oh, Keethy...

1036
01:19:15,450 --> 01:19:18,714
Beautiful, sweet Keethy. My life.

1037
01:19:21,530 --> 01:19:22,948
My heart.

1038
01:19:36,970 --> 01:19:39,708
I'm gonna try and make
things better with Evelyn.

1039
01:19:39,929 --> 01:19:41,434
I really am.

1040
01:19:43,449 --> 01:19:45,511
She hates me now

1041
01:19:46,849 --> 01:19:48,911
but I'll wear her down,

1042
01:19:49,249 --> 01:19:50,755
bit by bit.

1043
01:19:53,009 --> 01:19:54,590
Day by day.

1044
01:19:55,329 --> 01:19:58,745
Hour by hour, I'll seduce
her with my kindness.

1045
01:20:00,169 --> 01:20:04,186
I'll blanket her in
warmth and security.

1046
01:20:06,488 --> 01:20:09,227
I'll confound her with my decency.

1047
01:20:11,328 --> 01:20:14,276
She'll resist my charms
for only so long.

1048
01:20:16,048 --> 01:20:18,350
After all, I'm Dom Hemingway.

1049
01:20:21,008 --> 01:20:22,873
I'm Dom Hemingway.

1050
01:20:26,127 --> 01:20:27,785
I'm your Dom.

1051
01:20:37,567 --> 01:20:39,826
Come here. Sit down.

1052
01:20:42,607 --> 01:20:44,309
Give us your hand.

1053
01:20:47,006 --> 01:20:50,390
That's your grandmother.
Keethy, or Katherine.

1054
01:20:55,406 --> 01:20:59,948
She never much liked the dark ones, but
I think she'd have really liked you.

1055
01:21:25,045 --> 01:21:26,685
I didn't think you'd come.

1056
01:21:26,686 --> 01:21:28,964
Couldn't well take the
bus himself, could he?

1057
01:21:31,685 --> 01:21:33,747
Can I walk with you a bit?

1058
01:21:34,245 --> 01:21:36,187
In silence, I promise.

1059
01:21:36,405 --> 01:21:38,603
Total silence, like... Like a mime.

1060
01:21:38,604 --> 01:21:41,747
Like an old lady who lives
in an attic on her own

1061
01:21:42,324 --> 01:21:44,867
and stuffs her cats
after they died.

1062
01:21:51,165 --> 01:21:52,702
Not today.

1063
01:21:59,524 --> 01:22:01,870
Someday, then, eh, maybe?

1064
01:22:07,523 --> 01:22:10,109
You can walk Jawara to school
on Monday morning if you like.

1065
01:22:11,523 --> 01:22:13,465
If you can wake up that early.

1066
01:22:13,844 --> 01:22:16,430
Don't get too pissed
the night before.

1067
01:22:22,363 --> 01:22:23,824
Right, then.

1068
01:23:15,161 --> 01:23:17,704
Well, I'll be the Vatican's cunt.

1069
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:25,440
I'll see you later.
Right, let's go in.

1070
01:23:44,839 --> 01:23:47,338
Paolina! Hello, darling.

1071
01:23:49,759 --> 01:23:52,758
Fancy seeing you here in London.
Why didn't you call me?

1072
01:23:52,759 --> 01:23:54,318
We could have gone out for a drink,

1073
01:23:54,319 --> 01:23:56,679
had a tone-deaf sing-along
to some old records.

1074
01:23:56,680 --> 01:23:58,502
Paolina, who is this?

1075
01:23:58,879 --> 01:24:00,777
I don't know who this man is.

1076
01:24:01,039 --> 01:24:02,620
Oh...

1077
01:24:03,079 --> 01:24:04,944
I'll tell you who I am.

1078
01:24:05,159 --> 01:24:08,663
I'm the fucker who'll tear
your nose off with my teeth.

1079
01:24:09,239 --> 01:24:12,478
I'm the fucker who will gut
you with a dull cheese knife

1080
01:24:12,479 --> 01:24:14,798
and sing Gilbert and
Sullivan while I do it.

1081
01:24:14,799 --> 01:24:18,638
I'm the fucker who'll dump your
dead body in a freezing cold lake

1082
01:24:18,639 --> 01:24:21,858
and watch you sink to the
bottom like so much shit.

1083
01:24:22,758 --> 01:24:24,416
I am that fucker.

1084
01:24:25,478 --> 01:24:27,224
That's the fucker who I am.

1085
01:24:28,318 --> 01:24:31,899
And if you say one word
when I remove my hand,

1086
01:24:32,278 --> 01:24:34,197
I'll do all that to you right now.

1087
01:24:34,198 --> 01:24:38,476
You say one word and you'll be as useless
as a dried-up, fetid condom after bad sex.

1088
01:24:38,477 --> 01:24:40,357
Do I make myself clear?

1089
01:24:40,358 --> 01:24:42,076
Do my words translate to you?

1090
01:24:42,077 --> 01:24:44,336
If you understand my words, nod.

1091
01:24:46,478 --> 01:24:47,939
That's good.

1092
01:24:49,358 --> 01:24:53,178
After much heartbreak and ruin,

1093
01:24:54,397 --> 01:24:58,218
the pendulum of luck has finally
swung back to Dom Hemingway.

1094
01:24:59,717 --> 01:25:03,253
And I intend to enjoy each
moment of its fickle pleasure,

1095
01:25:03,517 --> 01:25:07,261
whether it lasts for a minute,
a day or a lifetime.
