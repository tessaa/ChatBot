Thank you very kindly.

4
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:31,042
Ladies and gentlemen,

5
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:35,795
the star of our show, the young man
you've all been waiting for.

6
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:40,049
So let's all get together and welcome
him to the stage with a great big hand.

7
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,258
How about it for Sam Cooke?

8
00:00:51,057 --> 00:00:54,643
Before we do anything, we?d like
to say how are you doing out there?

9
00:00:56,645 --> 00:00:58,396
- Is everyone feeling all right?
- Yeah!

10
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,022

00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,039
Oh, yeah!

00:01:28,878 --> 00:01:32,005
I believe we're gonna have
a goodtime tonight

20
00:01:33,257 --> 00:01:36,968
It's good to have somebody
you can twist the night away with

21
00:01:37,051 --> 00:01:39,136
Right now

22
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,595
Oh, yes, it is

23
00:01:41,471 --> 00:01:44,849
I said it feels good
when you got somebody

24
00:01:44,932 --> 00:01:47,518
To twist the night away
with right now

25
00:01:47,601 --> 00:01:49,936
- Lord have mercy.
- What you running from, son?

26
00:01:52,647 --> 00:01:54,231
We got a call.

27
00:02:00,278 --> 00:02:03,738
Don't fight the feelin'
Don?t fight the feelin'

00:02:13,204 --> 00:02:16,456
Oh, make me want you now

31
00:02:16,498 --> 00:02:18,876
Got to feel the feelin'

32
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,671
'Cause it make you groove right
when you feel the feelin'

33
00:02:23,754 --> 00:02:28,341
Make me want ya
when I got the feelin; baby

34
00:02:28,425 --> 00:02:30,634
So don't fight it

35
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:32,636
No, don?t fight it

36
00:02:32,678 --> 00:02:35,305
Baby, just feel it

37
00:03:29,263 --> 00:03:31,307
I'm gonna bust you up.

38
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:33,975
Beat your ass
like I was your daddy.

39
00:04:15,633 --> 00:04:18,718
I said I'm beginning
to feel allright now

40
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:28,726
I feel can tell you
about my baby right now

41
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:35,898
I said I feel
you're in the mood right now

42
00:04:44,613 --> 00:04:48,117
I said I feel
you're in the mood

43
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,078
Some times me and my baby
we fuss and fight

44
00:04:53,162 --> 00:04:56,081
And my baby leave home
'cause things ain't right

45
00:04:56,165 --> 00:04:58,583
For those of you
who think you came here today...

46
00:04:58,624 --> 00:05:01,377
to hear us tell you
like these Negro leaders do...

47
00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:04,045
that your times
will just get better...

48
00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:09,133
that we shall
overcome someday...

49
00:05:09,216 --> 00:05:12,260
I say to you,
you came to the wrong place.

50
00:05:12,343 --> 00:05:15,637
Because your times will never
get better unless you make them better.

51
00:05:16,889 --> 00:05:19,766
Those of you who think you came here
to hear us tell you...

52
00:05:19,808 --> 00:05:23,436
to turn the other cheek
to the brutality of the white man...

53
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:27,397
and this system of injustice
that's in place right here in America...

54
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:29,815
you think you're gonna come here
and hear us tell you...

55
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:33,902
to go out there and beg
for a place at their lunch counter...

56
00:05:34,694 --> 00:05:37,905
again, I say you came
to the wrong place.

57
00:05:37,946 --> 00:05:42,408
We don't teach you
to turn the other cheek in the South.

58
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:45,244
And we don't teach you
to turn the other cheek in the North.

59
00:05:45,286 --> 00:05:49,122
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad
teaches you to obey the law...

60
00:05:49,164 --> 00:05:51,957
to Cary yourselves
in a respectable way...

61
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:54,585
in a proud
Afro-American way.

62
00:05:55,294 --> 00:05:57,837
But at the same time,
we teach you...

63
00:05:57,921 --> 00:06:00,256
that anyone puts
their hand on you...

64
00:06:02,382 --> 00:06:07,512
brother, you do your best to see they
don't put their hand on anybody else...

65
00:06:07,595 --> 00:06:08,846
again.

66
00:06:13,308 --> 00:06:14,642
Time.

67
00:06:34,032 --> 00:06:35,992
Just like that, Daddy.

68
00:06:36,034 --> 00:06:38,119
Never jump in one place.
Bad for the heart.

69
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,745
Forwards, backwards, sideways.

70
00:06:39,829 --> 00:06:41,704
That's the most important thing.

71
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:54,965
I'm called Bundini.

72
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:58,593
Rhymes with Houdini.
He was a Jew too.

73
00:06:58,677 --> 00:07:02,388
Some people call me Fast Black.
Some call me Daddy Mac.

74
00:07:03,513 --> 00:07:06,224
Gave Sugar Ray Robinson
my power for seven years.

75
00:07:06,307 --> 00:07:08,767
My voodoo. My magic.

76
00:07:08,851 --> 00:07:11,770
Now Shorty done sent me here
to work for you.

77
00:07:11,854 --> 00:07:15,064
- Who's Shorty?
- I call him Shorty.

78
00:07:15,148 --> 00:07:17,315
Call him Shorty
'cause he like 'em circumcised.

79
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:22,194
Original people. Like Moses.
And I was a babe in a basket too.

80
00:07:22,278 --> 00:07:25,448
Born on a doorstep with a note
across my chest that read...

81
00:07:25,531 --> 00:07:28,575
"You do the best
you can for him, world. "

82
00:07:28,658 --> 00:07:30,576
I wanna be your inspiration.

83
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:33,328
Your motivator in your corner.

84
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:36,789
Can I be in your corner,
young man?

85
00:07:44,211 --> 00:07:45,629
Time!

86
00:07:49,048 --> 00:07:51,968
Got to tell you
how I feel right now

87

00:08:07,563 --> 00:08:10,399
Leaving me behind

Yeah, yeah

97

Listen, I got to be a man
to tell you this, honey, look

98
00:08:23,993 --> 00:08:26,036

of that money too

100
00:08:28,246 --> 00:08:30,831
But listen
That ain't all

That ain't all

00:08:42,091 --> 00:08:43,800
Get personal with him.

106
00:08:43,883 --> 00:08:46,302
This is important
Listen tome

107

00:08:53,057 --> 00:08:55,434
Till I'm buried

110
00:08:55,518 --> 00:08:57,894
Buried in my grave

111
00:08:57,936 --> 00:08:59,979

You know that I try

To treat you right
What did you do

118
00:09:16,992 --> 00:09:18,993
You stayed up

119
00:09:19,077 --> 00:09:21,287
You stayed up late at night

120
00:09:21,371 --> 00:09:23,330
I don't care

121
00:09:23,414 --> 00:09:25,290

Listen, let me hear you

00:09:42,762 --> 00:09:45,389
Yeah, oh, yeah

127
00:09:50,143 --> 00:09:53,271
Sonny Liston,
you ain't no champ! You a chump!

128
00:09:53,354 --> 00:09:55,480
Float like a butterfly,
sting like a bee.

129
00:09:55,564 --> 00:09:58,567
Oh!
Rumble, young man, rumble.

130
00:09:58,649 --> 00:10:01,402
Y'all wanna lose y' all money?
Then you bet it on Sonny.

131
00:10:01,485 --> 00:10:04,320
He know I'm great.
He will fall in eight.

132
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:07,157
Come on, you big, ugly bear.
I'll whup you right now.

133
00:10:08,866 --> 00:10:12,243
Two-ten and a half.
Two-ten and a half!.

134
00:10:12,326 --> 00:10:16,122
The challenger, Cassius Clay,
two hundred and ten and a half pounds.

135
00:10:16,164 --> 00:10:18,790
- Man, you sure that's right?
- That's what the weight is.

136
00:10:18,874 --> 00:10:21,459
Old, ugly bear, come on.
Let's go.

137
00:10:21,542 --> 00:10:26,004
You got these folks fooled. I ain't
scared of ya! I ain't scared of ya!

138
00:10:27,797 --> 00:10:30,090
Two hundred and eighteen.
Two hundred and eighteen.

139
00:10:30,174 --> 00:10:33,052
Sonny Liston,
the champion of the world.

140
00:10:33,135 --> 00:10:35,428
Two hundred and eighteen pounds.

141
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:37,555
- Pounds of what?
- Pounds of ugly.

142
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:40,140
That man's so ugly,
when he sweat...

143
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:44,018
the sweat run backwards off his forehand
just to stay away from his face.

144
00:10:48,521 --> 00:10:51,232
Come on, you big, ugly bear!
I'll turn you into a rug!

145
00:10:51,316 --> 00:10:53,776
Keep talkin'.
I'm gonna fuck you up.

146
00:11:00,323 --> 00:11:01,740
If you whup me...

147
00:11:01,823 --> 00:11:05,744
I'll crawl out of the ring and take
the first jet airplane out the country.

148
00:11:05,827 --> 00:11:08,954
- Is that a promise, Mr. Clay?
- You'll eat his words first.

149
00:11:09,038 --> 00:11:12,874
- Cassius, you're a 7-1 underdog.
- Liston says he talks with his fists.

150
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:14,918
- What do you say?
- You scared of him?

151
00:11:15,001 --> 00:11:17,252
I'm gonna give Sonny Liston
talkin' lessons...

152
00:11:17,336 --> 00:11:19,796
boxin' lessons
and fallin' down lessons.

153
00:11:20,588 --> 00:11:23,716
Cassius, are you a black Muslim?
Pat Putnam says in the Miami Herald--

154
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,343
A man's religion is his own business.
What kind of question is that?

155
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:31,639
- Angelo, tell me--
- Malcolm X was in town, then he left.

156
00:11:31,722 --> 00:11:33,848
Was that so
he wouldn't embarrass you?

157
00:11:33,932 --> 00:11:35,809
- Yeah, Howard?
- Liston doesn't like you.

158
00:11:35,892 --> 00:11:38,727
Really can't stand you.
Says he wants to kill you.

159
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:40,854
Howard Cosell, you ain't
nothin' but an instigator.

160
00:11:40,938 --> 00:11:44,524
- Man, how you get that way?
- Cassius, now you?re being truculent.

161
00:11:44,607 --> 00:11:46,067
If it's good, I'm that.

162
00:11:48,568 --> 00:11:52,196
You next. Soon as I'm done with Sonny
Liston, I'm fightin' Howard Cosell.

163
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:54,240
Y'all write that down right now.

164
00:12:09,376 --> 00:12:11,086
That's good?

165
00:12:12,129 --> 00:12:13,713
Wanna check that out?

166
00:12:22,095 --> 00:12:24,430
Hey, man, when you get back?

167
00:12:24,471 --> 00:12:27,265
I just got here.
I'm front row, seat seven.

168
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:33,979
I'll be sittin'
with Mom and Dad.

169
00:12:36,814 --> 00:12:40,401
You should've stayed in the first place.
Nobody gotta hide when they're with me.

170
00:12:40,484 --> 00:12:42,819
There's nothing wrong
with being cool, my brother.

171
00:12:42,902 --> 00:12:43,820
He's right.

172
00:13:31,315 --> 00:13:33,942
- ...and challenger, Cassius Clay.
- Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

173
00:13:33,984 --> 00:13:37,320
Brought to you
by the City Service Oil Company...

174
00:13:37,403 --> 00:13:40,781
and its dealers
in 37 states and Canada...

175
00:13:40,822 --> 00:13:44,241
known to millions of motorists
for Big Gallon gasoline...

176
00:13:44,325 --> 00:13:48,078
and by new Wildroot,
totally new Wildroot in a new tube...

177
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:53,248
with a great formula that grooms hair
to look neat and natural, never greasy.

178
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,668
Another boxing milestone
is at hand.

179
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:59,671
In just a few minutes,
Louisville's Cassius Marcellus Clay...

180
00:13:59,712 --> 00:14:01,838
will be facing
the devastating punching power...

181
00:14:01,922 --> 00:14:05,175
of the heavyweight champion,
Charles "Sonny" Liston.

182
00:14:05,217 --> 00:14:09,387
...for the heavyweight championship
of the world.

183
00:14:11,846 --> 00:14:13,848
Introducing, on my right--

184
00:14:14,808 --> 00:14:16,809
And now the time has come.

185
00:14:16,892 --> 00:14:21,479
Both challenger and champion
are in the ring.

186
00:14:21,521 --> 00:14:24,981
The heavyweight championship
of the world is on the line.

187
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:28,859
I fit goes past the first round,
there will be surprises already.

188
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:33,029
Sonny Liston wrapped in that
tery cloth towel of his...

189
00:14:33,113 --> 00:14:35,782
wrapped around his head
swami fashion...

190
00:14:35,865 --> 00:14:38,701
Looking as malevolent
and baleful as ever.

191
00:14:38,742 --> 00:14:42,120
But this man
is a professional prizefighter.

192
00:14:42,203 --> 00:14:44,247
Make no mistake about it.

193
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,376
I want a clean fight.

194
00:14:49,418 --> 00:14:51,836
When I say break,
stop punching and step back.

195
00:14:51,877 --> 00:14:54,005
Do you have
any questions, champ?

196
00:14:54,088 --> 00:14:55,922
Any questions, challenger?

197
00:14:56,006 --> 00:14:59,759
We're fine.
Touch gloves, gentlemen. Good luck.

198
00:15:02,761 --> 00:15:05,555
Good evening,
sports fans across the nation.

199
00:15:05,596 --> 00:15:08,224
Liston in the white trunks
with the black stripes.

200
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:12,436
Clay, an inch and a half taller, in
the white trunks with the red stripes--

201
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:29,324
And Cassius Clay
is sidestepping.

202
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,295
There it is, champ.
Stay on your toes now.

203
00:15:54,176 --> 00:15:57,929
And we can see that the champion
is the aggressor.

204
00:15:57,971 --> 00:16:00,556
There's a shot under the heart.

205
00:16:29,537 --> 00:16:32,957
Cassius Clay slips away.
And now Clay pounds a left.

206
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,042
Another left. A straight jab.

207
00:16:39,544 --> 00:16:42,339
It seems to have stunned him.
And that's the bell.

208
00:16:42,422 --> 00:16:45,841
And they're fighting after the bell.
And they're still fighting.

209
00:16:45,925 --> 00:16:48,510
This round is over.

210
00:16:48,593 --> 00:16:50,387
Break it up, ref.

211
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:53,555
There is no love lost between
the two contenders at this time.

212
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:57,475
Cassius goes back to his corner.
It's been an amazing round.

213
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,018
You can beat this guy.

214
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,022
I'm still here.

215
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:07,483
And Sonny Liston
is not taking the stool.

216
00:17:07,525 --> 00:17:10,568
He's anxious to get back
into the challenger's face.

217
00:17:10,652 --> 00:17:13,571
Take it to the body.
Kill the body, the head will follow.

218
00:17:44,637 --> 00:17:46,930
This is a totally different fight
than Liston expected...

219
00:17:47,014 --> 00:17:48,849
and anyone in this arena
will tell you.

220
00:17:48,932 --> 00:17:53,311
There's a long, looping left hand.
Clay's eyes are wide open now.

221
00:18:04,028 --> 00:18:06,362
- Come on, Cass! Move!
- Step back.

222
00:18:08,364 --> 00:18:11,241
- Come on, Cassius!
- Come on, Chi-Chi!

223
00:18:14,285 --> 00:18:15,953
I'm not prognosticating
anything...

224
00:18:16,037 --> 00:18:18,371
but merely his survival
to this juncture--

225
00:18:36,093 --> 00:18:38,054
Cass, hit him!

226
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:50,146
Break.

227
00:18:51,648 --> 00:18:53,483
Let him go.

228
00:19:21,921 --> 00:19:25,590
Sonny Liston is hurt.
He's bleeding from his eye.

229
00:19:28,551 --> 00:19:29,885
He's defying the experts early.

230
00:19:29,927 --> 00:19:34,806
We have to take a look at this man and
say he is not in awe of the champion.

231
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:06,664
He ain't nothin' to me.
And he know it.

232
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,165
This is it now.

233
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:16,088
Let me have that, John.

234
00:20:21,134 --> 00:20:22,760
And now they're ready.

235
00:20:26,972 --> 00:20:29,515
You gonna knock
the ugly off of him.

236
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:31,851
That's gonna take a long time,
but you can do it.

237
00:20:35,979 --> 00:20:38,272
There he is. Get him off.
Do your job, ref.

238
00:20:39,023 --> 00:20:41,400
Shake him.
Do your job, ref.

239
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:48,447
There it is.

240
00:20:49,239 --> 00:20:50,823
Come on, ref.

241
00:20:54,702 --> 00:20:55,702
Break.

242
00:21:01,832 --> 00:21:04,250
- There he is.
- Clay slips around and out.

243
00:21:07,295 --> 00:21:09,963
Up against the ropes.
Right above me now.

244
00:21:14,091 --> 00:21:16,636
Too tight. Get in there.

245
00:21:28,811 --> 00:21:31,104
My eyes. There's something in my eyes.
I can't see nothin'.

246
00:21:31,188 --> 00:21:32,272
Come on.

247
00:21:35,858 --> 00:21:37,109
- What's going on?
- Nothin'.

248
00:21:37,193 --> 00:21:40,737
The guy's punchin' on the breaks.
Just take care of it. We're fine.

249
00:21:42,781 --> 00:21:45,157
I can't see nothin', man.
Just go and cut 'em off, Angie.

250
00:21:45,199 --> 00:21:48,035
No, no. You can't fight
with no gloves on.

251
00:21:48,869 --> 00:21:50,828
Just get up. Get up.
Try and do it. Come on.

252
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:53,331
I can't see, man.

253
00:21:53,373 --> 00:21:56,041
- Come on, Cass!
- Dance!

254
00:22:02,712 --> 00:22:04,714
Liston crouching,
hitting to the body.

255
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:07,758
It's like he's blinking,
like he doesn't see Liston.

256
00:22:07,841 --> 00:22:10,427
Ref, you gotta doy our job.

257
00:22:20,143 --> 00:22:21,185
Hold it.

258
00:22:24,188 --> 00:22:26,565
Stay away from him, Clay.
Stay away from him.

259
00:22:27,357 --> 00:22:29,733
The champion, you can see,
is the aggressor.

260
00:22:36,197 --> 00:22:38,116
- Get him, Cass!
- Come on, Cass!

261
00:22:39,199 --> 00:22:41,702
- Knock him up!
- Clay looks all done.

262
00:22:41,785 --> 00:22:43,786
Hold on to him!

263
00:22:47,998 --> 00:22:50,792
- Stop it. Stop. Break.
- Knock him up.

264
00:22:54,169 --> 00:22:56,588
Get on him.
Get on him, man.

265
00:23:13,768 --> 00:23:16,729
- You can see him now.
- You go get him, man.

266
00:23:27,863 --> 00:23:30,364
Clay lands a left,
but Liston ducked under it...

267
00:23:30,448 --> 00:23:32,699
and took it high
on the forehead.

268
00:23:33,658 --> 00:23:35,869
It's Clay coming on.

269
00:23:40,789 --> 00:23:43,499
And Liston backs away.

270
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,871
And all the predictions
are going down the drain...

271
00:24:32,955 --> 00:24:34,873
as Liston is listless.

272
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:39,043
And there's the bell.

273
00:24:41,962 --> 00:24:43,880
We're coming up
to round seven.

274
00:25:22,201 --> 00:25:24,537
Wait a minute!

275
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,413
Liston's not coming out.

276
00:25:27,414 --> 00:25:30,708
The winner and new heavyweight
champion of the world is Cassius Clay.

277
00:25:30,791 --> 00:25:34,836
Eat your words!
Eat your words!

278
00:25:34,878 --> 00:25:38,672
Les, I'm going up into the ring.
Get back.

279
00:25:39,882 --> 00:25:42,259
I'm the greatest thing
ever happened to boxing.

280
00:25:42,342 --> 00:25:44,177
Cassius. Cassius.

281
00:25:44,218 --> 00:25:46,804
I shook up the world!

282
00:25:46,888 --> 00:25:50,140
It's a scene of
absolute bedlam in the ring!

283
00:25:50,223 --> 00:25:54,476
I am the greatest.
I'm a bad man. I shook up the world!

284
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,270
Did he ever hurt you?

285
00:25:56,353 --> 00:25:59,355
I'm only 22 years old.
I ain't got a mark on my face.

286
00:25:59,397 --> 00:26:01,356
- I must be the greatest.
- And you're pretty.

287
00:26:01,398 --> 00:26:03,358
I must be the greatest.

288
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,694
Wait. Hold on. Hold on one second.
That's Sam Cooke back there.

289
00:26:06,736 --> 00:26:08,696
- Come on, Sam Cooke.
- Let Sam Cooke in here.

290
00:26:08,738 --> 00:26:11,656
The greatest rock-and-roll singer,
and I'm the world's greatest boxer.

291
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,241
Hello, Sam.

292
00:26:22,165 --> 00:26:24,333
That mummy's
gonna get him, baby.

293
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:27,586
- That mummy ain't gonna get him.
- Yeah, he is.

294
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:31,923
He ain't scared of that mummy.
That mummy too slow to catch anybody.

295
00:26:32,881 --> 00:26:35,509
- What's going on, Sam?
- How you doing, Cassius?

296
00:26:35,592 --> 00:26:40,054
Don't believe that stuff on TV.
Don't listen to him.

297
00:26:40,095 --> 00:26:42,222
- Hey, congratulations, Clay.
- Hey, thank you, Jim.

298
00:26:42,305 --> 00:26:45,308
- Hell of a fight.
- You next, man. You next.

299
00:26:45,391 --> 00:26:48,685
- Go ahead and get some food, brother.
- Cassius Clay versus Jim Brown.

300
00:26:48,769 --> 00:26:50,187
Biggest fight in history.

301
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:53,397
- The mummy only has one eye.
- One eye and a limp.

302
00:26:53,439 --> 00:26:56,066
That mummy's 643 years old.

303
00:26:56,107 --> 00:26:58,068
He can't catch nobody.
Look at him.

304
00:26:58,109 --> 00:27:01,320
You gotta fall down 'cause that's
the only way the mummy could catch you.

305
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,288
Way to go, champ!

306
00:27:16,958 --> 00:27:20,377
- Yeah, you the greatest.
- Thank you, brother. Thank you.

307
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,419
- I'll see your next fight.
- You'll see the next one?

308
00:27:22,503 --> 00:27:25,339
- Oh, yeah.
- Well, you better get there very early.

309
00:27:25,422 --> 00:27:28,424
You better get there very early
'cause that man's going down.

310
00:27:31,134 --> 00:27:33,762
If he talk a little jive,
he's going down in five.

311
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,641
He talk a little more,
I might drop him in four.

312
00:27:39,767 --> 00:27:41,935
If you wanna have more fun,
do it in round one.

313
00:27:42,018 --> 00:27:44,104
Oh, yeah. Hold on.
I'm doing the rhymin'.

314
00:27:58,114 --> 00:28:01,367
The people really look up to you. You
plan on being a champ like Joe Louis?

315
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:04,411
Well, yeah, I'm gonna be
the people's champ.

316
00:28:04,494 --> 00:28:06,871
Not like Joe Louis.
Well, you know, not exactly.

317
00:28:09,331 --> 00:28:11,457
My name is not Clay.

318
00:28:11,499 --> 00:28:14,085
Clay is the name of the people
that owned my ancestors...

319
00:28:14,169 --> 00:28:17,171
and I no longer wanna be called
by that slave name.

320
00:28:17,254 --> 00:28:19,506
- I am Cassius X.
- Minister Malcolm.

321
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:21,841
What about the divisions
in the Nation of Islam?

322
00:28:21,924 --> 00:28:25,927
This is the champ's time. I'm here
as a friend to support his victory...

323
00:28:26,011 --> 00:28:28,472
so I have nothing you want.

324
00:28:28,513 --> 00:28:30,514
I'm definitely gonna be
the people's champion...

325
00:28:30,556 --> 00:28:33,017
but I just ain't gonna be the champ
the way you want me to be the champ.

326
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,518
I'm gonna be the champ
the way I wanna be.

327
00:28:46,694 --> 00:28:49,321
...for no home is immune
to termites...

328
00:28:49,362 --> 00:28:52,490
no matter how well
it is built or maintained.

329
00:28:52,573 --> 00:28:54,533
- Hey, brother.
- I was leaving.

330
00:28:54,617 --> 00:28:57,869
I saw your light on.
What you doing up at this hour, champ?

331
00:28:57,952 --> 00:29:01,705
Oh, man, I'm watching this program
on termites.

332
00:29:01,789 --> 00:29:06,042
And them little itsy-bitsy things is
eatin' these people's whole house down.

333
00:29:06,125 --> 00:29:08,836
Oh, man, look.

334
00:29:11,963 --> 00:29:16,717
I've been invited to speak
at Ibadan University in Nigeria.

335
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:19,469
- You wanna go with me?
- Hey, look, man.

336
00:29:19,552 --> 00:29:23,680
You can have six million termites
in your house and don't even know it...

337
00:29:23,722 --> 00:29:26,683
till you going to get something to eat
and you bust through the floor.

338
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:32,312
- What'd you say? Where?
- Africa. You been?

339
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:34,314
Africa.

340
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:36,733
All right, come on.
Let's go.

341
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,905
What is it?

342
00:29:48,408 --> 00:29:50,993
You ever thought
you'd lose it?

343
00:29:51,077 --> 00:29:53,830
I mean, really lose it?

344
00:29:57,666 --> 00:30:01,418
When I was little, I tore out
this picture of Emmett Till.

345
00:30:01,502 --> 00:30:03,420
They put the barbed wire
around his neck...

346
00:30:03,504 --> 00:30:07,674
and strapped him
to that 75-pound cotton gin fan.

347
00:30:07,757 --> 00:30:11,593
And they cut out one of his eyes
'cause he looked at some white lady.

348
00:30:13,427 --> 00:30:15,388
Man.

349
00:30:15,429 --> 00:30:18,515
I couldn't take my eyes to it,
couldn't throw it away.

350
00:30:23,102 --> 00:30:26,021
When I heard about those...

351
00:30:26,105 --> 00:30:29,065
four little girls who got bombed
in that Birmingham church...

352
00:30:32,276 --> 00:30:34,987
the prohibitions of the Honorable
Elijah Muhammad prevented me...

353
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:37,321
from speaking
my thoughts in action.

354
00:30:39,323 --> 00:30:41,533
Because Birmingham was part
of the civil rights struggle.

355
00:30:41,616 --> 00:30:45,828
You know, begging for our place
at the white man's table.

356
00:30:45,911 --> 00:30:48,581
But dead children
are dead children.

357
00:30:48,664 --> 00:30:53,208
So the anger I felt
I had to contain.

358
00:30:55,127 --> 00:30:58,212
I locked it up so tight...

359
00:30:58,296 --> 00:31:00,214
my muscles seized.

360
00:31:01,382 --> 00:31:04,301
I lost control
over the right side of my body.

361
00:31:04,384 --> 00:31:06,802
My leg gave out.

362
00:31:06,886 --> 00:31:09,597
Right arm gave out.
"I'm having a stroke," I thought.

363
00:31:11,181 --> 00:31:14,309
But I had to hold it in
'cause all I wanted--

364
00:31:14,392 --> 00:31:18,854
Brother, all I wanted to do
was find something and break it.

365
00:31:18,937 --> 00:31:22,106
Break a part--
Break any part of this system...

366
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:26,401
because you are so provoked
in your heart...

367
00:31:26,485 --> 00:31:28,612
and your spirit
as a human being...

368
00:31:30,529 --> 00:31:32,490
at dead children.

369
00:31:34,157 --> 00:31:36,242
And I could do...

370
00:31:38,827 --> 00:31:40,579
nothing.

371
00:31:49,002 --> 00:31:52,755
Everyone knows
I can't do nothing...

372
00:31:52,838 --> 00:31:54,256
anymore.

373
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:02,304
So Elijah Muhammad has suspended me
as a minister in the Nation of Islam.

374
00:32:10,811 --> 00:32:13,647
Man...

375
00:32:13,688 --> 00:32:15,231
you can fix that.

376
00:32:15,314 --> 00:32:18,192
I don't know.

377
00:32:18,234 --> 00:32:20,527
I'll try when we get back.

378
00:32:28,741 --> 00:32:30,785
You get some rest, champ.

379
00:32:30,868 --> 00:32:32,786
All right, brother.

380
00:33:08,064 --> 00:33:09,022
Sit.

381
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:26,036
You know, only after
long service and high merit...

382
00:33:26,077 --> 00:33:30,540
in the spiritual and physical rebirth
of Afro-American people...

383
00:33:30,581 --> 00:33:32,833
is one granted an original name.

384
00:33:32,916 --> 00:33:35,668
But you are special.

385
00:33:35,752 --> 00:33:37,211
A world champion.

386
00:33:39,755 --> 00:33:42,382
So there is a gift
I wish to give you.

387
00:33:42,424 --> 00:33:44,425
From this day forward...

388
00:33:44,467 --> 00:33:48,970
you will be known
as Muhammad Ali.

389
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:55,517
- What?
- That's right.

390
00:33:55,601 --> 00:33:57,519
You what?

391
00:34:00,021 --> 00:34:03,732
Well, what's wrong with our name?
My name?

392
00:34:03,774 --> 00:34:06,109
We-- We made you.

393
00:34:06,193 --> 00:34:07,651
Ain't nobody made me.

394
00:34:07,735 --> 00:34:09,862
No bow tie-wearin',
Arab-talkin' nigger gonna change that.

395
00:34:09,945 --> 00:34:11,863
Ain't nobody in that ring but me.
I made me.

396
00:34:11,946 --> 00:34:14,449
You don't know who you are.

397
00:34:14,532 --> 00:34:17,284
I know who I ain't.
I ain't drinkin'.

398
00:34:17,367 --> 00:34:19,661
I ain't going back on my wife
and for sure I ain't prayin'...

399
00:34:19,745 --> 00:34:21,913
to no blond-haired,
blue-eyed Jesus.

400
00:34:21,954 --> 00:34:25,916
Paintin' those blue-eyed, blond-haired
Jesuses is what put food in you.

401
00:34:25,999 --> 00:34:28,668
- Steak and vegetables on the table.
- It's dinner!

402
00:34:34,297 --> 00:34:36,216
Go ahead.

403
00:34:37,342 --> 00:34:38,675
Go ahead.

404
00:35:00,609 --> 00:35:01,860
Hello?

405
00:35:02,778 --> 00:35:05,321
Here you go, Daddy.

406
00:35:05,405 --> 00:35:06,948
Thank you, baby.

407
00:35:06,989 --> 00:35:09,450
- Yeah?
- Brother Malcolm.

408
00:35:09,491 --> 00:35:13,537
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad has given
the Muslim name of Muhammad Ali...

409
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:16,372
to Cassius X.

410
00:35:16,455 --> 00:35:19,874
Herbert Muhammad has been put
in charge of his training.

411
00:35:19,958 --> 00:35:22,210
He will not be traveling
with you to Africa.

412
00:35:22,293 --> 00:35:24,920
He also asked me
to inform you...

413
00:35:25,003 --> 00:35:28,005
that your suspension
will be extended indefiinitely.

414
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:41,099
Brother Cassius
won't be coming to Africa.

415
00:35:44,686 --> 00:35:46,645
Not with me.

416
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:52,734
Don't put it off.

417
00:35:57,988 --> 00:35:59,905
We'll be fine.

418
00:36:05,035 --> 00:36:06,411
I will.

419
00:36:06,494 --> 00:36:09,663
I got a little doll
for Atallah.

420
00:36:09,705 --> 00:36:10,789
Really?

421
00:36:10,873 --> 00:36:12,498
Yeah, it?s beautiful.

422
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:15,376
I've got so much
to show the girls when I get back.

423
00:36:15,418 --> 00:36:17,836
- I'm taking alot of pictures.
- Yeah?

424
00:36:17,878 --> 00:36:20,213
Yeah, I got some good stuff
I want to show you.

425
00:36:20,297 --> 00:36:22,214
Are you eating?

426
00:36:23,215 --> 00:36:25,801
Well, you're not cooking, so--

427
00:36:25,885 --> 00:36:28,511
- What's going on? Anything?
- Nothing.

428
00:36:29,471 --> 00:36:31,597
He's on the phone,
talking to his wife.

429
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,850
She's having a hard time sleeping,
the baby's kicking a lot...

430
00:36:34,932 --> 00:36:37,226
what are they gonna
name the baby.

431
00:36:40,062 --> 00:36:44,106
I just wake up a couple of times
in the night, but it?s okay.

432
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,077
Would you like to take a seat?

433
00:36:59,118 --> 00:37:01,079
Sure, thank you.

434
00:37:04,748 --> 00:37:06,957
What y'all done did
with the real pilot?

435
00:37:07,041 --> 00:37:09,919
I am the pilot.
He's the copilot.

436
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,920
Here. Sit down, Mr. Clay.

437
00:37:11,961 --> 00:37:14,381
Oh, man.

438
00:37:14,422 --> 00:37:18,384
In Louisville, where I growed up,
they barely let black folks drive buses.

439
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,420
Muhammad!

440
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:06,676
Hey, brother.
What's going on, man?

441
00:39:10,846 --> 00:39:12,805
- What you doing here?
- I was just going to the airport.

442
00:39:12,847 --> 00:39:15,475
We just got here now.
So where you going?

443
00:39:15,516 --> 00:39:16,476
Liberia.

444
00:39:16,517 --> 00:39:19,978
Say hello to Maya Angelou right here
and Ambassador Huang Hua.

445
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:22,855
And that is Taher Kaid.
He's the ambassador from Algeria.

446
00:39:22,938 --> 00:39:26,107
Oh, man. Where should I go?
I wanna go all over this place.

447
00:39:26,191 --> 00:39:28,318
Go to Algeria.
See Ben Bella.

448
00:39:28,401 --> 00:39:32,696
Then go to see Mecca and Medina.
I just came from there.

449
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:35,114
Made my seven circuits
around the Kaaba.

450
00:39:35,198 --> 00:39:38,326
I prayed at sunrise. Two million people.
Pilgrims from all over, man.

451
00:39:38,368 --> 00:39:41,536
Dressed the same.
High and low, the same.

452
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:45,456
Blond-haired, blue-eyed Muslims,
Arabs, Africans, Indonesians.

453
00:40:00,259 --> 00:40:03,178
Seeing brothers just like us,
praying together, it was beautiful.

454
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:05,263
I drank water
from the well of Zem Zem.

455
00:40:05,347 --> 00:40:10,393
I prayed in the ancient city of Mena.
I prayed on Mount Arafat.

456
00:40:10,476 --> 00:40:12,894
You shouldn't have quarreled
with Elijah Muhammad.

457
00:40:14,229 --> 00:40:16,438
Walking in their footsteps.

458
00:40:16,522 --> 00:40:18,148
All of us together.

459
00:40:18,232 --> 00:40:21,067
You shouldn't have quarreled
with the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.

460
00:40:21,901 --> 00:40:23,528
What?

461
00:40:24,695 --> 00:40:28,115
You shouldn't have quarreled
with Elijah Muhammad.

462
00:40:28,198 --> 00:40:30,700
Hey, Brother Muhammad,
look here.

463
00:40:35,036 --> 00:40:36,955
Brother Muhammad!

464
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:01,181
Listen, I'm sorry
to keep you waiting.

465
00:41:15,276 --> 00:41:16,902
Into each life...

466
00:41:16,986 --> 00:41:19,029
a little rain must fall.

467
00:41:19,112 --> 00:41:21,990
And, you know,
every day cannot be sunny.

468
00:41:22,073 --> 00:41:24,742
Every smile is not
a smile of happiness.

469
00:41:24,783 --> 00:41:26,285
And every tear that is shed--

470
00:41:26,327 --> 00:41:28,578
Sonji, Sonji, Sonji.

471
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:32,372
- What you keep saying my name for?
- 'Cause I love it, girl.

472
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:34,833
-How long you been working with Herbert?
-About a year.

473
00:41:34,916 --> 00:41:37,793
I sell Muhammad Speaks
over the phone.

474
00:41:37,877 --> 00:41:41,671
- What kind of name is that?
- My father named me after Sonja Henie.

475
00:41:42,797 --> 00:41:44,758
What's your father do?

476
00:41:44,799 --> 00:41:48,927
He was shot in a poker game
when I was two, so he don't do nothing.

477
00:41:49,011 --> 00:41:51,429
And my mother died
when I was eleven.

478
00:41:51,471 --> 00:41:54,348
- Who raised you?
- My godparents.

479
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:58,435
But I been off on my own
for a long time.

480
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,520
What you doing tomorrow?
Go for a ride with me.

481
00:42:01,604 --> 00:42:04,064
- Oh, no, no. I gotta work.
- I'm gonna square it with Herbert.

482
00:42:04,147 --> 00:42:07,025
- Herbert said you met the Beatles.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

483
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:10,110
Only one of 'em is smart, though.
The fella with the glasses.

484
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:12,320
Oh, he is my favorite.

485
00:42:12,403 --> 00:42:15,031
Yeah, folks was screaming
and fainting.

486
00:42:15,114 --> 00:42:17,532
I said, "Man, is this how they act
when you get big?"

487
00:42:17,616 --> 00:42:20,243
- What did he say?
- He said, "Champ...

488
00:42:20,327 --> 00:42:24,205
the more real you get,
the more unreal it's gonna get."

489
00:42:25,122 --> 00:42:27,123
Wow.

490
00:42:32,586 --> 00:42:34,505
Your

491
00:42:35,755 --> 00:42:39,925
Precious love

492
00:42:40,008 --> 00:42:41,718
Love

493
00:42:41,802 --> 00:42:45,638
Means more tome

494
00:42:47,723 --> 00:42:51,893
More, more

495
00:42:51,977 --> 00:42:55,187
Than any love

496
00:42:55,271 --> 00:42:57,689
Can ever bring me

497
00:42:57,730 --> 00:43:00,650
Never came true

498
00:43:00,692 --> 00:43:03,277
Oh, and I

499
00:43:06,195 --> 00:43:08,197
I wanted you

500
00:43:08,281 --> 00:43:10,907
Let me tell ya
I was so lonely

501
00:43:10,991 --> 00:43:14,911
So lonely, lonely
So lonely and so blue

502
00:43:15,995 --> 00:43:18,372
Good God All mighty

503
00:43:18,414 --> 00:43:20,623
That's what love will do

504
00:43:20,707 --> 00:43:22,166
Do

505
00:43:27,087 --> 00:43:29,380
Let's go.

506
00:43:29,463 --> 00:43:30,965
Yeah.

507
00:43:31,048 --> 00:43:33,092
Where you live?

508
00:43:33,174 --> 00:43:35,093
I'm gonna take you there.

509
00:43:36,386 --> 00:43:39,722
And you know I got a man somewhere
out there that I don't mind crawling to.

510
00:43:39,805 --> 00:43:43,141
Sometimes I wake up in the midnight
hour, tears rolling down my face.

511
00:43:43,224 --> 00:43:45,143
And if I look around for my man
and I can't find him...

512
00:43:45,226 --> 00:43:47,686
I follow the Lord,
look a little higher.

513
00:43:47,728 --> 00:43:49,479
Kind of pray to the Lord.

514
00:43:49,563 --> 00:43:52,732
Because I always believed that the Lord
could help me if nobody else could.

515
00:43:52,815 --> 00:43:54,734
But sometime
I think he don't even hear me.

516
00:43:54,775 --> 00:43:57,235
So I have to fall a little lower
on my knees, look a little higher.

517
00:43:57,277 --> 00:43:59,404
Kind of raise my voice
a little higher.

518
00:43:59,487 --> 00:44:01,614
And this is what I say
when I call on my man.

519
00:44:01,697 --> 00:44:05,158
I especially want you ladies to listen
to me 'cause maybe you can try this.

520
00:44:05,241 --> 00:44:07,243
It might help you
every once in a while.

521
00:44:07,327 --> 00:44:09,786
This is what you say
when you call on your man.

522
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:11,788
Get in tune to--

523
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:23,255
Darlin'

524
00:44:23,297 --> 00:44:26,800
Darlin; don't you know

525
00:44:26,884 --> 00:44:30,762
That I love you so much, yeah

526
00:44:32,387 --> 00:44:34,681
Fall down on my knees

527
00:44:34,765 --> 00:44:36,849
Beg my baby, please

528
00:44:36,933 --> 00:44:40,478
I got to tell the man
that I love him, yes, I will

529
00:44:43,688 --> 00:44:45,648
For your precious love

530
00:44:45,731 --> 00:44:47,900
For your precious love

531
00:44:47,983 --> 00:44:50,401
There?s nothing
There?s nothing, nothing

532
00:44:50,443 --> 00:44:53,738
In this whole wide world
I wouldn?t do for you, darling

533
00:44:55,614 --> 00:44:58,616
I'll walk all night
out in the rain

534
00:44:58,699 --> 00:45:02,328
Lord, I got to see
my baby again

535
00:45:02,411 --> 00:45:04,996
I got to tell the man
that I love him

536
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:07,165
One more time, yeah

537
00:45:22,343 --> 00:45:23,844
You ain't no Muslim, huh?

538
00:45:23,928 --> 00:45:27,764
Cover my hair, wear no makeup
and wear those long dresses?

539
00:45:27,806 --> 00:45:29,349
Honey, please.

540
00:45:33,644 --> 00:45:35,144
Were you a virgin?

541
00:45:35,937 --> 00:45:39,022
A virgin? How you gonna--
What you saying?

542
00:45:39,106 --> 00:45:43,485
Well, you were just so gone,
off on a little good time.

543
00:45:43,526 --> 00:45:46,654
Well, no,
I ain't no virgin.

544
00:45:46,737 --> 00:45:48,196
But I may as well be.

545
00:45:49,072 --> 00:45:51,491
I ain't joking.

546
00:45:51,533 --> 00:45:54,285
I always know when I know.

547
00:45:56,370 --> 00:45:58,663
You see this face?

548
00:45:58,705 --> 00:46:00,790
You got a pretty face
for a lady's face...

549
00:46:00,873 --> 00:46:03,292
but you ever seen anything
as pretty as me?

550
00:46:03,333 --> 00:46:06,043
Who wouldn't want
to be with me?

551
00:46:06,127 --> 00:46:08,254
What, you five foot three
or something like that?

552
00:46:08,337 --> 00:46:10,881
That's too small for me,
but I'm gonna make an exception.

553
00:46:10,964 --> 00:46:13,300
- Oh, well, thank you.
- Because of your spirit.

554
00:46:13,341 --> 00:46:15,968
- My spirit?
- Yeah, girl. You too much fun.

555
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:18,637
- But you got to be a Muslim.
- A Muslim?

556
00:46:18,679 --> 00:46:22,265
And how you do that? You jump over
a broom and, shazam, you're a Muslim?

557
00:46:22,348 --> 00:46:25,183
I ain't never been
with nobody like you.

558
00:46:25,267 --> 00:46:27,269
And, baby...

559
00:46:27,352 --> 00:46:30,688
baby, you ain't never
gonna be with any other.

560
00:46:47,409 --> 00:46:49,369
- What?
- That's right.

561
00:46:51,621 --> 00:46:53,748
I wanna marry her.

562
00:46:55,916 --> 00:46:57,375
True love.

563
00:46:57,417 --> 00:47:00,753
You don't marry that girl.
She was a date.

564
00:47:00,836 --> 00:47:02,504
Have some fun.

565
00:47:02,546 --> 00:47:06,299
She's not your wife.
You don't marry this girl.

566
00:47:06,382 --> 00:47:09,843
Here's some management papers.
I need you to sign right there.

567
00:47:09,885 --> 00:47:11,595
My father would kill me.

568
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:14,597
Watch what you're signing, Ali.

569
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:16,599
This ain't got nothing
to do with you.

570
00:47:16,682 --> 00:47:20,852
Anything's to do with me I say is to do
with me, fat boy. I'm still a Christian.

571
00:47:21,519 --> 00:47:25,022
And get me a kosher cook. I want
that lady over at Malcolm's temple.

572
00:47:25,064 --> 00:47:27,148
- Lana Shabazz.
- And put my brother on payroll.

573
00:47:27,232 --> 00:47:29,776
Fifty G a year
just for drivin' and jivin'.

574
00:47:29,859 --> 00:47:32,778
What do you say, Howard?
Come on full-time as my photographer?

575
00:47:32,861 --> 00:47:36,656
I'm not gonna be on the payroll.
I'm freelance. Emphasis on "free."

576
00:47:36,739 --> 00:47:39,408
Muhammad, she's not for you.

577
00:47:39,492 --> 00:47:41,535
When I met her,
she worked in a cocktail lounge...

578
00:47:41,576 --> 00:47:43,703
with a bunny tail
on her backside.

579
00:47:43,745 --> 00:47:46,664
What the hell was you doing
in a bunny tail lounge anyway, Herbert?

580
00:47:46,747 --> 00:47:48,582
Sellin' Muhammad Peeks?

581
00:47:51,417 --> 00:47:55,170
- You been saving it up training, Ali.
- Your ass.

582
00:47:55,254 --> 00:47:57,965
You should spread that stuff around
a little bit before you settle down.

583
00:47:58,048 --> 00:48:01,050
No, man. Marriage is
the cornerstone of Muslim life.

584
00:48:01,092 --> 00:48:05,220
- Yeah, well, Sonji Roi is not a Muslim.
- Well, she's gonna be now.

585
00:48:05,262 --> 00:48:07,680
You just fix it up, Herbert.

586
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:27,737
Yeah. Okay.

587
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:30,698
So, why we meeting?

588
00:48:30,781 --> 00:48:33,909
I got Malcolm shoulder to shoulder
with Martin Luther King.

589
00:48:33,951 --> 00:48:36,870
And we got Malcolm traveling all over
the world, getting Ben Bella and Nasser.

590
00:48:40,414 --> 00:48:43,333
We were better off before
with Malcolm inside the Nation.

591
00:48:45,293 --> 00:48:49,087
So we've decided
we want you...

592
00:48:49,129 --> 00:48:52,590
to get Elijah Muhammad
to take Malcolm back.

593
00:49:01,014 --> 00:49:03,056
That's a joke, Joe.

594
00:49:15,274 --> 00:49:18,444
When am I being reimbursed
for my expenses?

595
00:49:18,527 --> 00:49:20,862
Dry-cleaning all these suits
is not free.

596
00:49:22,739 --> 00:49:25,115
We gotta talk about this guy too.

597
00:49:28,826 --> 00:49:32,288
Get me receipts, I'll reimburse you
for your dry cleaning.

598
00:49:41,961 --> 00:49:43,880
- What you drinking?
- What I'm drinking?

599
00:49:43,963 --> 00:49:46,882
Come on, champ. This is water.
You know I'm a natural man.

600
00:49:46,965 --> 00:49:48,383
You know.

601
00:49:48,467 --> 00:49:51,385
- What's going on? We're late.
- I'm changing my damn clothes.

602
00:49:51,469 --> 00:49:54,931
You gave me that look,
so I know you don't like what I had on.

603
00:49:56,348 --> 00:49:58,975
- What is this?
- What you wanted, isn't it?

604
00:49:59,059 --> 00:50:01,268
- A water glass with vodka in it.
- No, that was before.

605
00:50:01,352 --> 00:50:04,771
- Before what, sir?
- Before you showed up. Get out of here.

606
00:50:06,189 --> 00:50:09,316
I'm fine running around here
in these cute, short things for you.

607
00:50:09,399 --> 00:50:11,109
I am submissive to you.

608
00:50:11,193 --> 00:50:14,529
I ain't gonna be submissive to them
Brother X's and Z's...

609
00:50:14,612 --> 00:50:16,489
about what they think.

610
00:50:16,531 --> 00:50:19,115
They ask me a bunch
of questions all the time anyway.

611
00:50:19,199 --> 00:50:21,159
- What questions?
- About you and us.

612
00:50:21,201 --> 00:50:23,953
- And I ain't telling them shit.
- You tell it like it is, sugar.

613
00:50:27,872 --> 00:50:30,708
Took away my boy's name.
What they give him back?

614
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:32,084
Bad style.

615
00:50:34,795 --> 00:50:39,131
I think you drunk.
Daddy Clay, you're something else.

616
00:50:39,215 --> 00:50:42,676
Now, that's a firecracker right there.
We're gonna have to work with that.

617
00:50:42,759 --> 00:50:44,719
- A scale of one to ten.
- That's right.

618
00:50:44,761 --> 00:50:46,929
I have one-- I had a ten--
Well, I didn't have a ten.

619
00:50:47,012 --> 00:50:49,681
I had a five--
five good twos.

620
00:50:51,224 --> 00:50:54,893
I don't drink. I don't smoke.
I converted to Islam for you.

621
00:50:54,977 --> 00:50:57,855
Okay? l--
All except the dress.

622
00:52:38,599 --> 00:52:41,101
What you doing in my pockets, man?
Get your hand out of my pocket!

623
00:52:41,185 --> 00:52:43,436
- Hold it, my brothers.
- We got a thief in here!

624
00:52:43,478 --> 00:52:45,605
Just be cool.

625
00:52:45,688 --> 00:52:47,272
Be cool.

626
00:53:39,063 --> 00:53:40,939
Brother, you crazy?

627
00:53:41,022 --> 00:53:44,401
They killed Malcolm!
They shot Malcolm! They shot Malcolm!

628
00:53:44,484 --> 00:53:46,402
They shot Malcolm!

629
00:53:48,237 --> 00:53:52,782
...wash it seven times
in the chest and body...

630
00:53:52,866 --> 00:53:55,451
and one in the lower
right shin.

631
00:53:55,534 --> 00:53:59,120
Apparently, the unknown man...

632
00:53:59,203 --> 00:54:02,706
walked up
to the speaker's platform...

633
00:54:02,789 --> 00:54:06,585
at the time
Malcolm X was speaking...

634
00:54:08,043 --> 00:54:11,671
opened fire at him
at very short range.

635
00:55:18,766 --> 00:55:21,976
The arena is surrounded by FBI.

636
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:24,561
The stands are only half full.

637
00:55:24,603 --> 00:55:28,648
The promoter has taken out
a million-dollar insurance policy...

638
00:55:28,731 --> 00:55:33,902
due to Cassius Clay's membership in
the militant and radical black Muslims.

639
00:55:33,985 --> 00:55:38,072
And, oh, by the way,
Sonny Liston is here too.

640
00:55:38,114 --> 00:55:40,741
Touch gloves
and come out fighting.

641
00:56:12,307 --> 00:56:13,891
Come on, son.

642
00:56:13,975 --> 00:56:16,686
- Come on, Chi-Chi.
- Put a whupping on him now.

643
00:56:22,606 --> 00:56:24,775
Ain't nothing changed.

644
00:56:24,859 --> 00:56:27,235
Whup on him now.
Whup up on him.

645
00:56:29,821 --> 00:56:31,697
Way to go!

646
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:36,451
- There it is!
- Sock it to him, baby!

647
00:56:45,666 --> 00:56:47,084
Yes!

648
00:56:47,168 --> 00:56:49,794
Get up!
Ain't nobody gonna believe this.

649
00:56:49,878 --> 00:56:51,963
Get up!

650
00:56:52,046 --> 00:56:53,214
Yes!

651
00:57:06,349 --> 00:57:08,309
Confused.
We're confused.

652
00:57:09,935 --> 00:57:12,353
- Check his time.
- Timekeeper's sounding it's over.

653
00:57:12,395 --> 00:57:14,355
Check his time!

654
00:57:16,482 --> 00:57:17,566
It is over!

655
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:32,369
I think the champ
was in a hurry.

656
00:57:41,043 --> 00:57:42,461
Are you okay?

657
00:57:44,545 --> 00:57:46,631
What's wrong?

658
00:57:46,714 --> 00:57:49,633
Why you all done up like that?

659
00:57:52,384 --> 00:57:54,887
I'm out there dying for you
out of worry.

660
00:57:54,970 --> 00:57:56,471
- Worry?
- Yes.

661
00:57:56,554 --> 00:57:58,973
And all you can think about
is if I look dull enough?

662
00:57:59,766 --> 00:58:02,893
What if I straightened my hair
and moved into some white suburb?

663
00:58:02,976 --> 00:58:05,020
How I am says something.

664
00:58:29,122 --> 00:58:31,499
You want me to go get her?

665
00:58:44,092 --> 00:58:45,260
Not now.

666
00:58:45,343 --> 00:58:47,261
- Not right now, fellas.
- Not now.

667
00:58:52,932 --> 00:58:56,393
- What I got to do?
- About Sonji?

668
00:58:56,435 --> 00:58:58,729
Have no contact with her
for 90 days.

669
00:58:58,812 --> 00:59:01,063
Make a public statement
of divorce at the mosque...

670
00:59:01,105 --> 00:59:03,315
and Islamic law
will be satisfied.

671
00:59:03,399 --> 00:59:06,860
Satisfaction is not making it with
the woman who send you to the moon?

672
00:59:06,943 --> 00:59:08,902
I'm the only normal person
left around here.

673
00:59:08,986 --> 00:59:11,572
I'm a black Jew, I can't read
and I'm half drunk.

674
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:15,199
I need to talk to you.

675
00:59:16,617 --> 00:59:19,745
- No, you can stay, Brother Herbert.
- Brother? He ain't your brother.

676
00:59:19,828 --> 00:59:23,039
Your brother's taking your wife back
to Chicago. She's crying like a widow.

677
00:59:23,122 --> 00:59:25,791
- Well, I ain't dead.
- Well, you may as well be.

678
00:59:25,875 --> 00:59:28,418
You don't remember your name
or who you are.

679
01:00:41,975 --> 01:00:44,560
You gonna try for Germany?

680
01:00:44,644 --> 01:00:46,354
You gonna try to get
stationed in Germany?

681
01:00:46,437 --> 01:00:51,191
- Everybody is trying to avoid Vietnam.
- What you talkin' about, man?

682
01:00:51,274 --> 01:00:54,276
They changed your classification.
It's in the paper.

683
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:56,153
- What?
- Champ. Eskridge.

684
01:00:56,195 --> 01:00:57,654
You're 1 A.

685
01:01:00,699 --> 01:01:03,158
They tryin' to draft me in the army?
You know about this?

686
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:04,451
Okay, here we go.

687
01:01:05,576 --> 01:01:09,622
All right, all right.
Hey, I got to go.

688
01:01:13,542 --> 01:01:15,543
They started runnin'.

689
01:01:17,712 --> 01:01:17,837
You know, so I went down there,
I did everything I was supposed to do...

690
01:01:17,837 --> 01:01:20,380
You know, so I went down there,
I did everything I was supposed to do...

691
01:01:20,463 --> 01:01:22,382
and I flunked
their draft board test.

692
01:01:22,465 --> 01:01:26,552
Then without testing me again,
to see if I'm any wiser or worser...

693
01:01:26,635 --> 01:01:29,053
they decide
I can go in the army?

694
01:01:29,137 --> 01:01:31,389
- Cassius, in my opinion--
- My name ain't Cassius Clay.

695
01:01:31,472 --> 01:01:34,016
That is a slave name,
and I am a free man.

696
01:01:34,099 --> 01:01:35,684
I am Muhammad Ali.

697
01:01:35,767 --> 01:01:41,022
You know, I apologize.
I apologize to you on the air.

698
01:01:41,105 --> 01:01:43,314
Your name is Muhammad Ali.

699
01:01:43,398 --> 01:01:45,525
You have a right to be called
whatever you want.

700
01:01:45,608 --> 01:01:47,568
I apologize to you.

701
01:01:47,609 --> 01:01:51,195
You sure make a lot of mistakes
for a so-called educated man.

702
01:01:51,279 --> 01:01:53,698
- You really went to law school?
- Yes, Muhammad.

703
01:01:53,740 --> 01:01:57,534
And to think I gave up a lucrative
practice for the likes of you.

704
01:01:57,576 --> 01:01:59,577
I'm the best thing
ever happened to you, Cosell.

705
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:03,497
Without me, you'd be a tall white man
with a microphone in his mouth.

706
01:02:03,581 --> 01:02:06,833
And without me,
you'd be a mouth.

707
01:02:13,755 --> 01:02:15,673
We'll be right back.

708
01:02:17,091 --> 01:02:20,719
- You want some food for that thing?
- How could you do such a thing?

709
01:02:20,802 --> 01:02:23,429
- 'Cause it's funny.
- To someone you revere.

710
01:02:23,512 --> 01:02:26,431
- That thing almost bit my finger off.
- Mr. Bundini...

711
01:02:26,473 --> 01:02:30,727
I'm glad you were here
to witness this-- this assault.

712
01:02:33,479 --> 01:02:36,105
Have a little coffee
with your sugar.

713
01:02:40,192 --> 01:02:42,110
They're coming after you...

714
01:02:42,194 --> 01:02:45,738
because they're scared of
black militancy in the inner cities.

715
01:02:47,198 --> 01:02:51,618
I ain't no H. Rap Brown.
I ain't no Stokely Carmichael.

716
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:53,452
All they are is political.

717
01:02:53,535 --> 01:02:56,121
You're the heavyweight
champion of the world.

718
01:03:11,925 --> 01:03:14,052
Here's the deal the government offered.
You do six weeks in basic.

719
01:03:14,135 --> 01:03:16,637
You go to the reserves.
You don't go to Vietnam.

720
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:19,640
Now, the messenger would not object
if you joined under those terms.

721
01:03:19,723 --> 01:03:21,516
I stay out of jail and keep boxing.

722
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:23,893
If you accept the induction,
life goes on.

723
01:03:34,651 --> 01:03:34,693
Marvin Decker Anderson,
US Army.

724
01:03:34,693 --> 01:03:38,445
Marvin Decker Anderson,
US Army.

725
01:03:40,155 --> 01:03:43,741
Juan Raymondo Benitez,
US Army.

726
01:03:45,743 --> 01:03:48,996
Pryce Marshall Benson,
US Marines.

727
01:03:53,499 --> 01:03:57,627
Cassius Marcellus Clay,
US Army.

728
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:10,637
Mr. Clay,
I'm required to inform you...

729
01:04:10,721 --> 01:04:13,682
that refusal to accept
a lawful induction order...

730
01:04:14,473 --> 01:04:16,684
constitutes a felony...

731
01:04:16,767 --> 01:04:20,478
under the Universal Military
Training and Service Act...

732
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:24,606
punishable by
five years imprisonment...

733
01:04:24,690 --> 01:04:27,526
and a $10,000 fine.

734
01:04:27,609 --> 01:04:29,193
Do you understand?

735
01:04:29,777 --> 01:04:32,155
Yes, sir.

736
01:04:51,878 --> 01:04:54,631
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

737
01:04:54,713 --> 01:04:57,549
Mr. Clay, you're under arrest
for refusing induction.

738
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:37,664
Yeah.

739
01:05:37,747 --> 01:05:39,957
Yeah, this is me.

740
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:43,752
No, you got to ask Chauncey Eskridge.
That's my lawyer. He's in Chicago.

741
01:05:45,586 --> 01:05:47,505
No, I'm out on bail.

742
01:05:49,589 --> 01:05:52,968
No, man, I ain't never
shot nothin' in my life.

743
01:05:53,051 --> 01:05:56,971
No ducks, no geese,
no deer, no nothin'.

744
01:05:57,054 --> 01:06:00,682
Yeah, I know where Vietnam is.
It's on TV.

745
01:06:02,224 --> 01:06:06,019
Southeast Asia?
What, it's there too?

746
01:06:09,981 --> 01:06:12,148
What do I think about who?

747
01:06:12,232 --> 01:06:13,775
The Vietcong?

748
01:06:16,110 --> 01:06:19,280
Man, I ain't got no quarrel
with them Vietcong.

749
01:06:20,905 --> 01:06:24,200
Ain't no Vietcong
ever called me nigger.

750
01:06:25,158 --> 01:06:27,202
Yeah, that's right.

751
01:06:32,164 --> 01:06:34,833
You know what you're doin', Ali?

752
01:06:36,126 --> 01:06:37,919
You know what you just said?

753
01:06:38,585 --> 01:06:40,629
Everyone, Europe to China,
every home in America...

754
01:06:40,713 --> 01:06:42,755
everyone?s gonna know what the
heavyweight champion of the world...

755
01:06:42,797 --> 01:06:44,924
said about the US war.

756
01:06:46,718 --> 01:06:49,720
So what? So what?
I ain't got to be...

757
01:06:49,803 --> 01:06:51,762
what nobody else
want me to be...

758
01:06:51,804 --> 01:06:54,473
and I ain't afraid to be
what I wanna be...

759
01:06:54,557 --> 01:06:56,558
think how I wanna think.

760
01:07:15,489 --> 01:07:18,492
I got almost nowhere I can
promote a fight for you.

761
01:07:18,575 --> 01:07:20,994
Plus I think they're gonna
vacate you from the crown.

762
01:07:21,077 --> 01:07:23,329
- What?
- Yeah, if you're convicted.

763
01:07:24,997 --> 01:07:28,207
Oh, so they're gonna take from me
what no fighter in the world can.

764
01:07:28,291 --> 01:07:30,251
And New York may revoke
your boxing license.

765
01:07:30,335 --> 01:07:33,295
You sure you wanna do this?

766
01:07:33,378 --> 01:07:36,465
The next three to four years
are every heavyweight's prime.

767
01:07:36,547 --> 01:07:39,425
There are few of those years.

768
01:07:42,177 --> 01:07:45,305
- What about Terrell?
- We'll know about that this afternoon.

769
01:07:45,347 --> 01:07:48,641
I gotta find us some venues fast.
I'll call you later.

770
01:07:53,269 --> 01:07:58,815
You understand the issue is your
license to fight Terrell in Illinois?

771
01:07:58,899 --> 01:08:00,483
Yes.

772
01:08:00,566 --> 01:08:02,818
Then are you prepared
to apologize...

773
01:08:02,902 --> 01:08:05,612
about your unpatriotic remarks
about the war?

774
01:08:15,036 --> 01:08:17,704
- You say you're the people's champion.
- Yes, sir.

775
01:08:17,788 --> 01:08:20,290
Do you think you're acting
like the people's champion?

776
01:08:20,374 --> 01:08:23,417
Yes, sir.
I'm not gonna apologize to you.

777
01:08:23,501 --> 01:08:27,045
This is not a courtroom, and I do not
have to answer your questions.

778
01:08:35,969 --> 01:08:38,846
- What about Terrell?
- We'll fight in another state!

779
01:08:38,888 --> 01:08:41,306
- Are you gonna dodge the draft?
- I ain't draft-dodgin'...

780
01:08:41,390 --> 01:08:43,850
I ain't burnin' no flag,
and I ain't runnin' to Canada.

781
01:08:43,934 --> 01:08:46,894
I'm stayin' right here.
You wanna send me to jail?

782
01:08:46,978 --> 01:08:49,271
Fine. You go right ahead.
I've been in jail for 400 years.

783
01:08:49,354 --> 01:08:51,273
I can be there
for four or five more.

784
01:08:51,356 --> 01:08:53,274
But I ain't going'
no 10,000 miles...

785
01:08:53,357 --> 01:08:55,859
to help murder and kill
other poor people.

786
01:08:55,943 --> 01:09:00,238
If I wanna die, I'll die right here
right now, fightin' you, if I wanna die.

787
01:09:00,321 --> 01:09:04,241
You my enemy. Not no Chinese,
no Vietcong, no Japanese.

788
01:09:04,324 --> 01:09:06,368
You my opposer
when I want freedom.

789
01:09:06,451 --> 01:09:10,162
You my opposer when I want justice.
You my opposer when I want equality.

790
01:09:10,246 --> 01:09:11,955
You want me to go somewhere
and fight for you.

791
01:09:12,038 --> 01:09:14,040
You won't even stand up for me
right here in America...

792
01:09:14,082 --> 01:09:16,041
for my rights
and my religious beliefs.

793
01:09:16,083 --> 01:09:18,419
You won't even stand up for me
right here at home.

794
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:23,006
- Which guy you want to go first?
- You, sir.

795
01:09:23,089 --> 01:09:26,049
Tell Clay he gettin' on after me.
I'm the champ.

796
01:09:26,091 --> 01:09:28,968
- What?
- I said you can get on after me.

797
01:09:29,051 --> 01:09:31,721
- No. What'd you call me?
- I called you Clay.

798
01:09:31,804 --> 01:09:34,389
You will announce it from right here,
from flat on your back.

799
01:09:34,431 --> 01:09:36,474
What's my name?
What's my name?

800
01:09:38,350 --> 01:09:42,396
What's my name? Say my name!
You gonna say my name!

801
01:09:42,438 --> 01:09:45,106
Your mama called you Clay!
I'm gonna call you Clay!

802
01:09:45,189 --> 01:09:47,232
I want you all to tell
all their aunts...

803
01:09:47,274 --> 01:09:49,276
and all their uncles
and cousins and friends...

804
01:09:49,318 --> 01:09:51,819
get to your television set,
get to your radio...

805
01:09:51,903 --> 01:09:54,447
'cause I never wanted
to whup a man so bad!

806
01:10:08,541 --> 01:10:11,335
What's my name?
What's my name?

807
01:11:07,003 --> 01:11:11,090
What's my name, motherfucker?
What's my name?

808
01:11:14,008 --> 01:11:16,094
What's my name?

809
01:11:35,858 --> 01:11:38,152
The jury has found you guilty
of refusing induction...

810
01:11:38,236 --> 01:11:41,530
into the United States
Armed Forces.

811
01:11:41,613 --> 01:11:43,657
Does the defense have anything
it wants to say?

812
01:11:43,740 --> 01:11:47,159
Yeah, I'd appreciate if the court would
just give me my sentence right now...

813
01:11:47,201 --> 01:11:50,537
rather than waitin' and stallin'.

814
01:11:50,620 --> 01:11:52,163
Very well.

815
01:11:54,915 --> 01:11:58,376
I sentence you to
the maximum sentence allowable:

816
01:11:58,418 --> 01:12:01,671
five years imprisonment
and a fine of $10,000.

817
01:12:03,255 --> 01:12:05,340
Doubtless your lawyer
will lodge an appeal...

818
01:12:05,382 --> 01:12:08,676
so while you're free on bond, I order
that your passport be surrendered.

819
01:12:09,468 --> 01:12:14,180
I'll not have you benefiting yourself
by fighting abroad.

820
01:12:14,222 --> 01:12:16,348
This court is adjourned.

821
01:12:55,921 --> 01:12:55,962
Hold on. Watch this.
I've been working on this at home.

822
01:12:55,962 --> 01:12:59,549
Hold on. Watch this.
I've been working on this at home.

823
01:12:59,591 --> 01:13:01,634
Just relax.

824
01:13:01,717 --> 01:13:05,094
See? 'Cause it's spooky and sometimes
people get scared and run.

825
01:13:05,136 --> 01:13:07,388
Pay attention.
This is very spooky.

826
01:13:10,057 --> 01:13:12,392
Go ahead.
Blow on that for me.

827
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:20,398
See, you don't need
to fight no more.

828
01:13:24,193 --> 01:13:26,779
You don't remember me, do you?

829
01:13:28,655 --> 01:13:32,866
Yeah. I remember somethin'.
What's your name?

830
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:35,244
- You know my name.
- I know your name.

831
01:13:35,327 --> 01:13:38,746
You came to my school
right before you won the title.

832
01:13:38,788 --> 01:13:41,456
I interviewed you
for my school paper.

833
01:13:41,540 --> 01:13:43,750
I was eleven.

834
01:13:44,835 --> 01:13:47,253
You had a long braid.

835
01:13:47,294 --> 01:13:49,296
Yeah.

836
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:52,257
- You called me "Little Indian Girl."
- Wow.

837
01:13:53,633 --> 01:13:55,759
- Man, that was you.
- That was me.

838
01:13:57,010 --> 01:14:00,304
And I loved you then,
just like all them kids did.

839
01:14:00,388 --> 01:14:02,640
I never stopped.
I still do.

840
01:15:07,523 --> 01:15:09,859
Hey, did you see
that Ellis-Quary fight?

841
01:15:09,942 --> 01:15:11,818
Yeah.

842
01:15:13,862 --> 01:15:17,031
We're gonna be in front of
the US Court of Appeals next month.

843
01:15:17,114 --> 01:15:18,157
We're gonna lose.

844
01:15:18,199 --> 01:15:21,159
- We'll appeal to the Supreme Court.
-Jimmy Ellis, the champ.

845
01:15:21,201 --> 01:15:23,912
Man, I've been whupping on that boy
since I was 1 6.

846
01:15:23,995 --> 01:15:26,622
All that's gonna happen,
they gonna give Ellis to Frazier...

847
01:15:26,705 --> 01:15:29,332
Frazier's gonna kill him,
then what?

848
01:15:29,373 --> 01:15:32,460
Where's the gate?
Then they got to let me fight.

849
01:15:33,877 --> 01:15:37,838
Jimmy Ellis.
Fight that boy in a phone booth.

850
01:15:37,922 --> 01:15:41,926
Fight him in the middle of Times Square.
You think that'd draw a crowd?

851
01:15:42,009 --> 01:15:45,553
Champ, draw a crowd
or not draw a crowd...

852
01:15:45,637 --> 01:15:48,347
it's not gonna make a difference
with your boxing licenses.

853
01:15:51,933 --> 01:15:54,685
The ACLU's handling your case
against the New York Boxing Commission.

854
01:15:54,769 --> 01:15:57,521
They've discovered that New York's
got actual ex-murderers...

855
01:15:57,562 --> 01:16:00,189
and ex-rapists
currently licensed to fight.

856
01:16:00,272 --> 01:16:02,733
But revoke yours?

857
01:16:02,775 --> 01:16:06,027
They don't want you to fight.

858
01:16:06,110 --> 01:16:07,445
- Tijuana.
- No.

859
01:16:07,529 --> 01:16:10,405
State Department refuses permission
for the one-hour visa.

860
01:16:10,447 --> 01:16:13,200
No fight in Tijuana.
Look--

861
01:16:13,283 --> 01:16:16,661
Can't fight here.
Can't fight outside the country.

862
01:16:16,744 --> 01:16:18,662
I know people
in the restaurant business.

863
01:16:18,745 --> 01:16:21,248
They want to start a chain.
Muhammad Ali Champ Burgers.

864
01:16:21,331 --> 01:16:23,666
Muhammad Malts,
Fistful of Fries.

865
01:16:23,749 --> 01:16:25,584
All of that.

866
01:16:25,668 --> 01:16:27,710
Why do I wanna be
in the restaurant business?

867
01:16:27,752 --> 01:16:29,045
'Cause you need the money.

868
01:16:29,128 --> 01:16:32,047
- How much all this gonna cost?
- Too much.

869
01:16:33,882 --> 01:16:36,259
They do that to you too, you know.

870
01:16:36,342 --> 01:16:38,302
They bust you out.

871
01:16:51,437 --> 01:16:52,438
All right.

872
01:16:56,441 --> 01:16:58,943
Go get me some
Champ Burgers.

873
01:17:09,326 --> 01:17:11,287
Did y'all see that?
That man just hit me.

874
01:17:11,328 --> 01:17:14,873
Oh, you done messed up now, sucka.
You done messed up--

875
01:17:14,956 --> 01:17:17,249
I don't wanna do nothin'
in front of your daughters, though.

876
01:17:17,291 --> 01:17:19,460
I can't beat you up
in front of your daughters.

877
01:17:19,543 --> 01:17:23,337
- Hey, champ, good to see you.
- All right, ladies. Take care now.

878
01:17:23,421 --> 01:17:25,465
All right now.
All right now.

879
01:17:36,347 --> 01:17:39,975
You called me "Little Indian Girl"
'cause I wore my hair in a braid.

880
01:17:42,352 --> 01:17:44,312
And then I said,
"Man, you scribble.

881
01:17:45,771 --> 01:17:47,398
You can't even write.

882
01:17:47,482 --> 01:17:49,941
Need to go back to school
till you learn how to do it better."

883
01:17:49,983 --> 01:17:53,402
Now, why you just havin'
a fresh mouth talkin' to me.

884
01:17:53,486 --> 01:17:55,446
So you think that's funny, huh?

885
01:17:55,529 --> 01:17:58,323
Telling me I can't write,
that I scribble.

886
01:17:59,073 --> 01:18:01,242
Now you wanna try
to make up with me.

887
01:18:01,326 --> 01:18:04,453
- This will make everything better.
- Shut up.

888
01:18:23,218 --> 01:18:25,803
Mommy and Daddy
moved to Mexico!

889
01:18:43,900 --> 01:18:45,860
Come on, baby.

890
01:18:46,944 --> 01:18:49,071
Oh, sweetie, come on.

891
01:19:02,748 --> 01:19:06,334
We will give you five minutes
to leave this area.

892
01:19:09,795 --> 01:19:12,381
Who is the heavyweight champion
of the world?

893
01:19:23,764 --> 01:19:25,766
What's happenin'?

894
01:19:40,694 --> 01:19:43,155
- Hey, man.
- We lost on the appellate level...

895
01:19:43,238 --> 01:19:44,448
in New Orleans.

896
01:19:44,531 --> 01:19:47,366
- We're heading to the Supreme Court.
- We already got turned down there.

897
01:19:47,408 --> 01:19:52,203
I'm petitioning on a conscientious
objection basis. Religious belief.

898
01:19:52,287 --> 01:19:55,456
I believe that they'll hear that.

899
01:19:55,539 --> 01:19:58,541
Where the money
gonna come from, Chauncey?

900
01:19:58,624 --> 01:20:02,295
Herbert say I'm runnin' on empty.
Now, just put aside...

901
01:20:02,378 --> 01:20:04,129
"How did that happen?"

902
01:20:04,212 --> 01:20:09,049
License all revoked, passport gone,
can't fight here, can't fight nowhere.

903
01:20:09,133 --> 01:20:11,218
Then what happen if I lose
at the Supreme Court?

904
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:16,014
Then you go to jail for five years.

905
01:21:31,697 --> 01:21:34,449
Oh, I saw Bundini
when I was in Europe.

906
01:21:34,533 --> 01:21:38,994
- Yeah? How is he?
- He's bad. He's in bad shape, man.

907
01:21:39,036 --> 01:21:41,955
You better get your belt back

908
01:21:46,126 --> 01:21:48,919
Look at this.

909
01:21:49,002 --> 01:21:51,462
Joe Frazier.
He can't up no gate.

910
01:21:51,504 --> 01:21:54,549
Can't fill no arena.
They got to let me fight.

911
01:21:54,632 --> 01:21:56,174
Fight.

912
01:21:59,553 --> 01:22:04,889
If that happens, promise me you?ll
put some new people around you.

913
01:22:07,684 --> 01:22:09,560
What you talkin' about?

914
01:22:10,728 --> 01:22:12,980
Where Herbert and them
when we need 'em?

915
01:22:13,021 --> 01:22:17,358
Gene Kilroy's dropping off groceries
like charity.

916
01:22:19,568 --> 01:22:22,737
We borrow money from my folks.

917
01:22:22,820 --> 01:22:27,240
They're all over you when you got it,
and then they just drop off you...

918
01:22:27,323 --> 01:22:28,992
when you don't.

919
01:22:44,661 --> 01:22:47,579
Norton, he's big and strong,
but he ain't nothin'.

920
01:22:47,663 --> 01:22:50,873
Hold on a second, Joe.
They're telling me we have a caller.

921
01:22:50,957 --> 01:22:54,293
- Go ahead, please.
- Cosell, this is Muhammad Ali.

922
01:22:54,376 --> 01:22:55,627
It's Muhammad Ali.

923
01:22:55,711 --> 01:22:57,796
Everybody knows
that I am the champ.

924
01:22:57,879 --> 01:23:01,257
The crown is a lie. I know it's a lie.
Joe Frazier knows it's a lie.

925
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:03,717
And it's time for everybody
to stop lying and tell the truth.

926
01:23:03,758 --> 01:23:07,137
Let's tell it like it is.
With your court and boxingproblems...

927
01:23:07,220 --> 01:23:09,221
can you get a fight promoted?

928
01:23:09,305 --> 01:23:11,515
I would fight Joe Frazier for free
in a phone booth...

929
01:23:11,598 --> 01:23:13,975
in the middle of Times Square
if I wasn't broke.

930
01:23:14,058 --> 01:23:16,227
Did you say you were broke?
How can you be broke?

931
01:23:16,311 --> 01:23:19,771
You made more money than all previous
heavyweights champions combined.

932
01:23:19,813 --> 01:23:22,356
What about your management?
Surely they have provided for you.

933
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:25,567
All I'm trying to say is it's time
for everybody to stop lyin'.

934
01:23:25,650 --> 01:23:27,360
Muhammad Ali is the champ.

935
01:23:27,444 --> 01:23:30,487
Get my son Herbert
on the telephone.

936
01:23:30,571 --> 01:23:33,407
Muhammad, thank you for calling in.
I'll relay that to Joe.

937
01:23:33,449 --> 01:23:37,619
And tell Joe I said
he is very ugly.

938
01:23:39,036 --> 01:23:42,247
Muhammad says that he will
fight you anywhere, anytime...

939
01:23:42,331 --> 01:23:47,084
and that the championship really is his
until that battle ensues.

940
01:24:00,303 --> 01:24:03,722
Mr. Ali has sporting blood.

941
01:24:03,805 --> 01:24:06,891
Mr. Ali wants a place
in this sports world.

942
01:24:06,974 --> 01:24:09,727
He loves it too much.

943
01:24:09,810 --> 01:24:14,272
I am therefore suspending Mr. Ali
from the practice of Islam.

944
01:24:14,356 --> 01:24:18,525
He may no longer appear in temple,
pray or teach...

945
01:24:18,609 --> 01:24:23,655
or have any conversation
with any Muslim whatsoever.

946
01:24:27,324 --> 01:24:28,908
Why didn?t you call
an ambulance or a doctor?

947
01:24:28,991 --> 01:24:31,619
Because he gave me your number
when he checked in.

948
01:24:31,661 --> 01:24:33,870
Normally, he's up there
making a lot of noise.

949
01:24:33,954 --> 01:24:36,414
But now he hasn't answered the door
in three days.

950
01:24:39,875 --> 01:24:41,627
- What's that?
- It's daylight.

951
01:24:43,169 --> 01:24:45,129
Get me that short dog.

952
01:24:47,631 --> 01:24:49,967
Give it to me.

953
01:24:52,677 --> 01:24:53,803
What's wrong with you?

954
01:24:53,844 --> 01:24:56,721
Ain't nothin' wrong with me.
My head ain't bad.

955
01:24:56,805 --> 01:24:58,723
- Leave me alone.
- Leave you alone. You called me!

956
01:24:58,807 --> 01:25:01,392
Yes, but that was a week ago.

957
01:25:01,475 --> 01:25:03,686
- Why are you shamin' yourself?
- Let me go, man.

958
01:25:03,769 --> 01:25:05,520
Why you doin' that
to yourself?

959
01:25:05,603 --> 01:25:08,314
- Why you shamin' yourself?
- Ain't nobody shamed.

960
01:25:08,356 --> 01:25:10,649
Ain't nothin' wrong with me.

961
01:25:10,691 --> 01:25:12,526
I'm flyin'.

962
01:25:12,609 --> 01:25:14,694
The Sky Chief talk through me.
I know the word.

963
01:25:14,777 --> 01:25:16,153
- You know low.
- Yeah?

964
01:25:16,195 --> 01:25:18,446
I know low where the king
is goin' back to his throne!

965
01:25:18,530 --> 01:25:21,324
- From the root to the fruit!
- Them rhymes is old, Bundini.

966
01:25:21,366 --> 01:25:23,325
You need to get some new ones.

967
01:25:27,203 --> 01:25:31,040
God don't care about you.
Don't care about me.

968
01:25:31,124 --> 01:25:34,334
In all of everything, we don't mean
nothin'. He don't owe us.

969
01:25:34,418 --> 01:25:36,127
We be.

970
01:25:36,210 --> 01:25:39,505
And that's the onliest thing He did.

971
01:25:39,589 --> 01:25:42,674
But that's good.
That's why we free.

972
01:25:42,716 --> 01:25:46,552
But free ain't easy. Free is real
and real is a motherfucker.

973
01:25:48,804 --> 01:25:51,556
It eats raw meat.

974
01:25:51,639 --> 01:25:54,182
It walk in its own shoes.

975
01:25:54,266 --> 01:25:56,727
It don't ever waiver.

976
01:25:56,810 --> 01:25:58,269
Yeah.

977
01:26:04,232 --> 01:26:07,110
I-- I sold your belt.

978
01:26:08,485 --> 01:26:11,447
I sold your belt to a barber
for $500 on Lenox Avenue.

979
01:26:11,530 --> 01:26:15,033
That's how low I did you.
I couldn't help it. I got a crazy mind.

980
01:26:17,326 --> 01:26:19,453
That belt say you the heavyweight
boxing champion of the world...

981
01:26:19,536 --> 01:26:22,455
and I took that $500...

982
01:26:22,538 --> 01:26:24,957
and I put it in my arm.

983
01:26:26,791 --> 01:26:28,835
That's what I called to tell you.

984
01:26:36,090 --> 01:26:39,384
I heard about the Nation stuff,
the courtroom.

985
01:26:41,303 --> 01:26:43,262
What you gonna do?

986
01:26:54,271 --> 01:26:56,106
Take me back.

987
01:27:04,529 --> 01:27:07,698
I could go down there and get the belt.
I can go get the belt.

988
01:27:47,521 --> 01:27:49,481
Hey, champ.

989
01:28:23,048 --> 01:28:28,970
$1 ,000 to the man that bring me
Howard Cosell's toupee dead or alive!

990
01:28:29,012 --> 01:28:31,638
Don't bother me.
I'm a world-famous sportscaster...

991
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:33,974
and you're an ex-champion
with diminished skills.

992
01:28:34,057 --> 01:28:35,808
I can't be seen with you.

993
01:28:39,186 --> 01:28:41,980
- How's it goin', champ?
- Pretty good, man.

994
01:28:47,735 --> 01:28:51,070
Muhammad, I'd do anything for you.
You know that.

995
01:28:51,154 --> 01:28:56,617
But I've got bosses who only
give a damn about Nielsen ratings.

996
01:28:56,700 --> 01:28:59,327
I guarantee...

997
01:28:59,410 --> 01:29:03,205
it will be a historical
and a momentous night.

998
01:29:09,251 --> 01:29:12,670
If they came to me tomorrow and say,
"We want you to fight Joe Frazier.

999
01:29:12,712 --> 01:29:15,715
Madison Square Garden.
Millions and millions of dollars.

1000
01:29:15,757 --> 01:29:18,342
Here's your license back."
I will tell them...

1001
01:29:18,425 --> 01:29:20,177
"I will never fight again."

1002
01:29:20,260 --> 01:29:23,721
Frankly, Muhammad, I'm surprised,
because unless you--

1003
01:29:23,763 --> 01:29:26,223
or until you fight Frazier--

1004
01:29:26,306 --> 01:29:30,267
Cosell, are you losin' your hearing
along with your hair?

1005
01:29:30,351 --> 01:29:33,395
Don't put no question to it, man.
I done told you, I'm through fightin'.

1006
01:29:33,479 --> 01:29:35,855
I got a much bigger contender,
a much heavier opponent.

1007
01:29:35,939 --> 01:29:37,857
I'm fightin'
the entire US government.

1008
01:29:39,107 --> 01:29:41,610
Do you think
you're going to jail?

1009
01:29:41,693 --> 01:29:44,362
I don't know. I don't know.

1010
01:29:44,403 --> 01:29:50,033
Joe Frazier told me on this show
that he could knock you out.

1011
01:29:50,075 --> 01:29:52,368
See, there you go agitatin'.

1012
01:29:52,409 --> 01:29:56,288
You should've asked Smokin' Joe
what have he been smokin'?

1013
01:29:56,372 --> 01:30:00,124
That boy even dream he whupped me,
he better wake up and apologize.

1014
01:30:00,208 --> 01:30:02,251
If I was to get in the ring with Joe...

1015
01:30:02,334 --> 01:30:04,253
here's what you might see.

1016
01:30:04,336 --> 01:30:09,048
Ali comes out to meet Frazier,
but Frazier starts to retreat.

1017
01:30:09,090 --> 01:30:13,343
If Joe goes back an inch farther,
he'll wind up in a ringside seat.

1018
01:30:13,426 --> 01:30:16,554
Ali swings with his left,
Ali swings with his right.

1019
01:30:16,637 --> 01:30:18,806
Just look at the kid
carry the fight.

1020
01:30:18,889 --> 01:30:21,474
Frazier keeps backin',
but there's not enough room.

1021
01:30:21,558 --> 01:30:25,018
It's only a matter of time
before Ali lowers the boom.

1022
01:30:25,102 --> 01:30:27,896
Ali swings with his right.
What a beautiful swing.

1023
01:30:27,980 --> 01:30:30,898
But the punch lifts Frazier
clean out of the ring.

1024
01:30:30,940 --> 01:30:33,733
Frazier's still risin',
and the referee wears a frown...

1025
01:30:33,817 --> 01:30:37,194
'cause he can't start countin'
till Frazier comes down.

1026
01:30:37,278 --> 01:30:40,614
Frazier's disappeared from view.
The crowd is getting frantic.

1027
01:30:40,698 --> 01:30:44,659
But our radar stations picked him up.
He's somewhere over the Atlantic.

1028
01:30:44,742 --> 01:30:46,994
Now, who would've thought
when they came to the fight...

1029
01:30:47,077 --> 01:30:51,038
they was gonna witness the launchin'
of a black satellite.

1030
01:30:51,122 --> 01:30:53,624
But don't wait for that fight.

1031
01:30:53,708 --> 01:30:55,876
It ain't never gonna happen.

1032
01:30:55,959 --> 01:30:58,044
Only thing you could do...

1033
01:30:58,128 --> 01:31:01,630
is wonder and imagine.

1034
01:31:02,214 --> 01:31:08,052
This has been another
sports exclusive from ABC.

1035
01:31:08,136 --> 01:31:10,137
- Two. Go two.
- Over to Jim McKay...

1036
01:31:10,220 --> 01:31:12,472
in Bern, Switzerland.

1037
01:31:12,556 --> 01:31:14,765
- How you gonna go from me to Jim McKay?
- Listen, uh--

1038
01:31:15,975 --> 01:31:19,644
- Did your wife leave you yet?
- No, she hasn't left me yet.

1039
01:31:19,728 --> 01:31:22,062
She's going to, 'cause I
told your wife when I seen her...

1040
01:31:22,146 --> 01:31:25,399
I said, "Listen, why you
doin' this to yourself?"

1041
01:31:34,531 --> 01:31:38,117
Oh, man, Joe.
Who dresses you?

1042
01:31:38,201 --> 01:31:41,077
You look like the heavyweight
champion of pimps.

1043
01:31:41,161 --> 01:31:43,205
Hey, shut up and get in.

1044
01:31:44,497 --> 01:31:46,040
That jacket?s a mess, man.

1045
01:31:50,335 --> 01:31:52,837
What you in Philly for?
Philly's my town.

1046
01:31:52,921 --> 01:31:55,923
Well, I just wanted to get
a little closer to you, honey.

1047
01:31:56,006 --> 01:31:57,007
Man, fuck you.

1048
01:31:59,342 --> 01:32:02,802
There'll be two undefeated heavyweight
champions, and they ain't fightin'.

1049
01:32:02,844 --> 01:32:05,555
- What about your license?
- I can fight in Atlanta.

1050
01:32:05,639 --> 01:32:08,307
There ain't no state boxing commission
in Georgia.

1051
01:32:08,349 --> 01:32:11,643
It's all set. I do a prelim in Atlanta
against Jerry Quary...

1052
01:32:11,684 --> 01:32:14,312
but we got to get this
steamroller movin' right now.

1053
01:32:14,354 --> 01:32:15,979
So what do I have to do?

1054
01:32:16,021 --> 01:32:19,441
All you got to do is announce
that after I whup Jerry Quary...

1055
01:32:19,525 --> 01:32:22,026
you gonna give me a title shot.

1056
01:32:22,109 --> 01:32:24,737
Come on, man.
Say it! Say it!

1057
01:32:33,494 --> 01:32:36,996
What I got and all I got,
I got with these right here.

1058
01:32:37,080 --> 01:32:39,331
Hell, man, I already got the title.

1059
01:32:39,414 --> 01:32:43,960
So I ain't got nothin' to win,
but I got eveythin' to lose.

1060
01:32:45,545 --> 01:32:47,921
Yeah, but you know
you ain't the real champ yet.

1061
01:32:57,053 --> 01:32:59,180
You beat Quary...

1062
01:32:59,222 --> 01:33:02,349
I'm gonna get you in the ring.
I'm gonna kick your ass.

1063
01:33:13,275 --> 01:33:15,651
By the way...

1064
01:33:15,734 --> 01:33:20,113
you need any money
or anything to tide you by?

1065
01:33:21,531 --> 01:33:23,448
No, I'm fine.

1066
01:33:38,377 --> 01:33:40,838
Time!

1067
01:33:48,385 --> 01:33:51,012
What you want?

1068
01:33:53,556 --> 01:33:55,515
Take me back, boss.

1069
01:33:57,267 --> 01:33:59,186
I'm clean.

1070
01:33:59,269 --> 01:34:03,647
This is a resurrection.
This is God's act.

1071
01:34:03,731 --> 01:34:06,900
And the prophet is goin' home.

1072
01:34:06,983 --> 01:34:09,318
Take me with you, boss.

1073
01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:12,446
I'll do anything.

1074
01:34:22,953 --> 01:34:26,831
Your hands can't hit
what your eyes can't see.

1075
01:34:29,834 --> 01:34:33,670
Float like a butterfly,
sting like a bee.

1076
01:34:33,754 --> 01:34:36,172
Rumble, young man, rumble.

1077
01:34:54,561 --> 01:34:54,728
God ain't watching'!
Ain't nobody but us!

1078
01:34:54,728 --> 01:34:58,272
God ain't watching'!
Ain't nobody but us!

1079
01:35:05,403 --> 01:35:08,239
There it is!
Stay in his face!

1080
01:35:12,117 --> 01:35:13,952
Go, Muhammad!

1081
01:35:25,460 --> 01:35:26,795
There it is!

1082
01:35:33,008 --> 01:35:34,592
Now for the right. Boom!

1083
01:35:40,973 --> 01:35:42,932
Prophet is goin' home
to the throne.

1084
01:35:59,737 --> 01:36:01,947
That's how you do it, Ali.

1085
01:36:02,030 --> 01:36:04,283
That's how you do it.

1086
01:36:11,371 --> 01:36:13,957
You okay?
You're a goddamn Superman.

1087
01:36:14,040 --> 01:36:16,292
Ain't no kryptonite
in this ring tonight.

1088
01:37:00,659 --> 01:37:02,870
- We want Joe Frazier!
- We want him!

1089
01:37:02,953 --> 01:37:07,499
- We want Joe Frazier!
- And you deserve it. You deserve it.

1090
01:37:11,210 --> 01:37:14,253
This prophet is comin' home,
goin' from the darkness to the light.

1091
01:37:17,048 --> 01:37:19,299
Soak it in this
for about 20 minutes.

1092
01:37:21,426 --> 01:37:24,261
We don't need their management.

1093
01:37:25,221 --> 01:37:28,598
Hey, Herbert, we did good.
Doin' good tonight.

1094
01:37:40,273 --> 01:37:42,025
All praise to Allah.

1095
01:37:45,569 --> 01:37:48,114
The messenger has lifted
your suspension.

1096
01:37:48,197 --> 01:37:50,115
Congratulations.

1097
01:37:50,198 --> 01:37:52,200
So you?re sayin'
I can be a Muslim again.

1098
01:37:52,283 --> 01:37:53,867
- Yes.
- I ain't never stopped.

1099
01:37:53,951 --> 01:37:55,911
Just like I ain't never stopped
bein' the champ.

1100
01:37:58,121 --> 01:37:59,789
I begged my father
to reinstate you.

1101
01:37:59,872 --> 01:38:02,666
When? When you do that, Herbert?

1102
01:38:02,749 --> 01:38:05,168
After I promoted this Quary fight
or after I won it?

1103
01:38:06,128 --> 01:38:08,170
- We can get Frazier.
- Man, I done already got Frazier.

1104
01:38:08,254 --> 01:38:10,714
We can get $5 million for Frazier.

1105
01:38:10,798 --> 01:38:13,925
We talkin' management,
talkin' money or talkin' religion?

1106
01:38:13,967 --> 01:38:16,969
When I got leery
and talked up why I'm broke...

1107
01:38:17,052 --> 01:38:18,595
then come the suspension.

1108
01:38:18,679 --> 01:38:22,223
Now you explain that one to me,
my brother.

1109
01:38:22,306 --> 01:38:24,475
That was my father.

1110
01:38:27,018 --> 01:38:28,979
Your father.

1111
01:38:29,020 --> 01:38:33,149
I love your father, Herbert.
I swear, man. I love the Nation.

1112
01:38:33,232 --> 01:38:35,692
But it don't own me.

1113
01:38:44,824 --> 01:38:47,576
You go on out there
and you make that Frazier deal.

1114
01:38:52,830 --> 01:38:54,749
My brother.
Yeah, your brother Herbert.

1115
01:38:54,832 --> 01:38:56,708
Go on somewhere,
make that deal.

1116
01:39:07,300 --> 01:39:10,594
And he accepts me.
I?m Jewish, but yet he's Muslim...

1117
01:39:10,677 --> 01:39:12,137
and we still get along.

1118
01:39:12,220 --> 01:39:15,723
He understands me. He understands me
and he still allows me to hang with him.

1119
01:39:15,806 --> 01:39:19,267
He knows I like pork and white women,
but still allows me to be here with him.

1120
01:39:19,350 --> 01:39:21,311
Now, I can give up pork...

1121
01:39:21,352 --> 01:39:24,146
but them white women,
goddamn it!

1122
01:39:24,229 --> 01:39:26,273
How you deal with it, boy?

1123
01:39:40,159 --> 01:39:43,453
Hello?
Muhammad, it's for you.

1124
01:39:47,915 --> 01:39:50,124
Thank you, Lana.

1125
01:39:50,208 --> 01:39:53,336
- Yeah?
- Muhammad? Howard Cosell.

1126
01:39:53,378 --> 01:39:57,005
- You TKO'd them.
- Hey, what you talkin' about, Howard?

1127
01:39:57,089 --> 01:39:59,091
- With Quary?
- No.

1128
01:39:59,173 --> 01:40:01,092
The Supreme Court ruled today...

1129
01:40:01,175 --> 01:40:04,511
in the case of The United States
vs. Cassius Clay...

1130
01:40:04,552 --> 01:40:08,347
aka Muhammad Ali.

1131
01:40:08,430 --> 01:40:12,393
You won an eight-to-zero
unanimous decision.

1132
01:40:12,434 --> 01:40:15,269
You're free.

1133
01:40:15,353 --> 01:40:17,312
Congratulations.

1134
01:40:33,701 --> 01:40:35,159
I'm free.

1135
01:40:41,081 --> 01:40:42,999
The Supreme Court
just set me free.

1136
01:40:47,878 --> 01:40:50,338
What are you talkin' about?

1137
01:40:51,673 --> 01:40:53,173
Eight-to-oh, unanimous decision.

1138
01:40:53,257 --> 01:40:55,968
The Supreme Court
just overturned my conviction.

1139
01:40:57,760 --> 01:41:00,471
- Yes!
- All right. All right.

1140
01:41:00,555 --> 01:41:02,014
- Did we get 'em, Ali?
- We got 'em, man.

1141
01:41:03,932 --> 01:41:06,059
Hey, man.

1142
01:41:07,435 --> 01:41:10,855
- Did we do it?
- We did it, man.

1143
01:41:10,938 --> 01:41:14,399
They wanna be on your side now because
the truth has shown itself to the power.

1144
01:41:14,482 --> 01:41:17,317
Now the power's comin' to the truth.
That's what it is.

1145
01:41:17,401 --> 01:41:19,820
And the truth tastes good
when there's a belly full of lies.

1146
01:41:19,903 --> 01:41:23,031
- What you talkin' about?
- It don't matter. It don't matter.

1147
01:41:31,829 --> 01:41:34,539
Ladies and gentlemen,

1148
01:41:34,622 --> 01:41:39,334
for the undisputed heavyweight
championship of the world.

1149
01:41:39,418 --> 01:41:44,297
In this corner, the contender and former
heavyweight champion of the world...

1150
01:41:44,380 --> 01:41:48,550
weighing in at 21 3 pounds...

1151
01:41:48,633 --> 01:41:52,470
with a record of31 and 0
with 25 knockouts...

1152
01:41:52,553 --> 01:41:55,222
Muhammad Ali!

1153
01:42:00,642 --> 01:42:05,355
His opponent,
weighing in at 2051/2 pounds...

1154
01:42:05,438 --> 01:42:09,566
with a record of26 and 0
with 23 knockouts...

1155
01:42:09,649 --> 01:42:13,195
the current heavyweight
champion of the world...

1156
01:42:13,278 --> 01:42:17,531
Smokin? Joe Frazier!

1157
01:42:19,574 --> 01:42:22,993
I want a good, clean fight.
Protect your self at all times.

1158
01:42:23,077 --> 01:42:26,288
Gentlemen, touch gloves.
Good luck to both of you.

1159
01:43:05,110 --> 01:43:06,277
Come on!

1160
01:43:06,361 --> 01:43:08,362
Stick him! Come on!

1161
01:43:50,979 --> 01:43:53,063
That's okay, champ.
Don't stop fightin'.

1162
01:43:55,149 --> 01:43:56,442
What's comin'?

1163
01:43:56,525 --> 01:43:59,861
Lean back, man.
Move back. Work, legs.

1164
01:44:12,412 --> 01:44:13,621
Ain't nobody hurt.

1165
01:44:13,705 --> 01:44:16,165
That's all right.
Ain't no--

1166
01:44:34,095 --> 01:44:35,472
Keep puttin' out.
Come on.

1167
01:44:47,272 --> 01:44:50,067
- Move, Ali!
- Back, back, back!

1168
01:45:23,384 --> 01:45:25,302
Muhammad, you said
you were gonna win the fight.

1169
01:45:25,386 --> 01:45:27,387
How do you account
for the beating you've taken?

1170
01:45:27,470 --> 01:45:30,181
- Did he hurt you?
-Joe said you don't wanna fight again.

1171
01:45:30,264 --> 01:45:32,808
Oh, how wrong he is.

1172
01:45:32,891 --> 01:45:34,434
- Why would it be different?
- Muhammad, wait!

1173
01:45:39,522 --> 01:45:42,816
- But I wanna ask him something!
- We all wanna ask him something.

1174
01:45:42,899 --> 01:45:45,484
- Sons of bitches! Get outta here!
- When are you gonna get a hairpiece?

1175
01:45:45,567 --> 01:45:47,569
Don't worry about it.
You lost all of yours.

1176
01:45:47,653 --> 01:45:49,613
You cue ball head motherfucker.
Get outta here!

1177
01:45:49,655 --> 01:45:52,031
-Just one more question.
- Let me talk to him.

1178
01:45:52,115 --> 01:45:54,366
We're close to the start
of round one.

1179
01:45:54,449 --> 01:45:56,284
Now that Smokin? Joe
done run outta tomato cans...

1180
01:45:56,368 --> 01:45:59,954
I got Yank to commit to a rematch
with you in about six months.

1181
01:45:59,996 --> 01:46:02,206
Frazier said he'd be happy
with three mil.

1182
01:46:02,289 --> 01:46:06,710
I'll fly to Jamaica, get Yank to sign
right after Joe beats this big stiff.

1183
01:46:08,168 --> 01:46:10,713
I think he hurt Joe Frazier.

1184
01:46:10,796 --> 01:46:13,464
I think Joe is hurt.

1185
01:46:13,506 --> 01:46:17,092
Down goes Frazier!
Down goes Frazier!

1186
01:46:17,175 --> 01:46:18,969
- Down goes Frazier!
- Get up, Joe.

1187
01:46:19,011 --> 01:46:22,596
The heavy weight champion is
taking the mandatory eightcount...

1188
01:46:22,680 --> 01:46:25,641
and Foreman
i spoised as can be.

1189
01:46:27,559 --> 01:46:30,020
Foreman is all over Frazier.

1190
01:46:30,103 --> 01:46:32,438
And Frazier is down again!

1191
01:46:32,521 --> 01:46:35,064
He maybe--
No, he's rising.

1192
01:46:36,983 --> 01:46:38,318
It's over! It is over!

1193
01:46:38,359 --> 01:46:41,695
It'd be easy to get a fight
with Frazier now.

1194
01:46:41,778 --> 01:46:46,032
Only thing he's champion of
is gettin' knocked down.

1195
01:46:46,115 --> 01:46:50,076
George Foreman is
the heavyweight champion of the world.

1196
01:46:51,870 --> 01:46:55,831
The Rumble in the Jungle.
That is the name that I've given it.

1197
01:46:55,914 --> 01:47:00,460
Muhammad Ali and George Foreman
in Kinshasa, Zaire.

1198
01:47:00,543 --> 01:47:02,544
- Don, Zaire?
- Yeah, Don.

1199
01:47:02,628 --> 01:47:05,005
I mean, why not Antarctica,
somethin' like that?

1200
01:47:05,088 --> 01:47:07,173
What's wrong with New York City?

1201
01:47:09,050 --> 01:47:11,092
Because you miss the significance.

1202
01:47:11,176 --> 01:47:15,387
See, I dream of overcoming

1203
01:47:15,471 --> 01:47:19,683
to the dawn of a new day of liberation,
financial and otherwise.

1204
01:47:19,767 --> 01:47:22,894
It will raise up the spirits
of our inner cities.

1205
01:47:22,977 --> 01:47:25,479
It will rise up and fill with hope,
the souls...

1206
01:47:25,562 --> 01:47:28,148
the unrequited needs
of the black proletariat.

1207
01:47:28,231 --> 01:47:31,067
That is, the discouraged, dispirited,
denigrated denizens...

1208
01:47:31,150 --> 01:47:34,152
of the demimonde
that is called the ghetto.

1209
01:47:34,235 --> 01:47:37,030
Man, Don, you crazy.

1210
01:47:37,072 --> 01:47:41,033
You must've studied the whole
"D" section of the dictionary.

1211
01:48:05,635 --> 01:48:07,553
Good morning, sister.

1212
01:48:10,013 --> 01:48:11,682
Hi, brother.

1213
01:48:13,684 --> 01:48:15,559
How you doin', champ?

1214
01:48:42,747 --> 01:48:44,833
Why they saying that?
What they sayin'?

1215
01:48:49,169 --> 01:48:51,254
What that mean?
I don't understand.

1216
01:48:51,337 --> 01:48:52,880
- It means--
- What?

1217
01:48:52,964 --> 01:48:56,383
It mean, "Ali, kill him.
Ali, kill him."

1218
01:49:42,961 --> 01:49:45,713
The champ is here!

1219
01:49:45,796 --> 01:49:49,591
Ladies and gentlemen, the heavyweight
champion of the world has arrived!

1220
01:49:51,176 --> 01:49:53,218
The champ is here!

1221
01:49:58,681 --> 01:50:00,433
Hey, man.

1222
01:50:00,516 --> 01:50:02,643
He's quite younger than you.
How you feeling about that?

1223
01:50:02,726 --> 01:50:05,395
He's quite younger than me?
Well, we quite younger than you.

1224
01:50:05,479 --> 01:50:09,941
What you talkin' about? Thirty-two
years old. Best shape of my life.

1225
01:51:07,360 --> 01:51:09,987
Hey, stop!
All right, back up.

1226
01:51:16,784 --> 01:51:20,036
Did you see Muhammad Ali?

1227
01:55:40,155 --> 01:55:43,699
- Here's your water.
- Oh, thank you, hon.

1228
01:55:43,783 --> 01:55:47,203
Bottled water.
Frozen steaks.

1229
01:55:47,286 --> 01:55:49,913
Brought all that stuffin
like Africa's ain't got no steaks.

1230
01:55:49,996 --> 01:55:53,916
- You could pick up parasites.
- Mobutu eats it.

1231
01:55:53,958 --> 01:55:56,544
Mobutu's takin' care of Mobutu.

1232
01:55:56,627 --> 01:55:59,254
He steals all the wealth
and sends it to Switzerland.

1233
01:56:00,630 --> 01:56:03,006
What that got to do
with any of why we here?

1234
01:56:03,090 --> 01:56:08,469
We are here 'cause Don King
got Mobutu to put up $1 0 million.

1235
01:56:08,553 --> 01:56:12,347
Don King don't care about Africa.
He's worse than Herbert.

1236
01:56:13,056 --> 01:56:15,432
Here come Herbert.

1237
01:56:15,516 --> 01:56:18,227
And Don King fit right in too.

1238
01:56:18,310 --> 01:56:20,603
Now he's a dashiki-wearin' rip-off.

1239
01:56:20,687 --> 01:56:22,689
Don King delivered the first-ever...

1240
01:56:22,772 --> 01:56:25,023
black-promoted
championship fight in Africa.

1241
01:56:25,107 --> 01:56:29,026
Don King talks black,
lives white and thinks green.

1242
01:56:29,110 --> 01:56:31,445
And you're defending him
and Brother Herbert?

1243
01:56:31,487 --> 01:56:34,447
'Cause clean-cut Muslims in a parade
on the South Side of Chicago...

1244
01:56:34,489 --> 01:56:37,575
ain't gonna get this done!

1245
01:56:38,450 --> 01:56:41,328
I got to put honkies with connections
and bad-ass niggas to it.

1246
01:56:41,412 --> 01:56:43,329
And now they matched you up
against George Foreman.

1247
01:56:43,413 --> 01:56:46,373
Do you think they give a damn
if you get killed?

1248
01:56:52,712 --> 01:56:54,755
So that's what you think?

1249
01:57:04,013 --> 01:57:07,015
I just wanna know why
my Muslim husband...

1250
01:57:07,098 --> 01:57:10,142
is allowing himself
to get strung up on a cross.

1251
01:57:10,225 --> 01:57:12,227
Just tell me why.

1252
01:57:20,567 --> 01:57:22,235
Mayum's sick.

1253
01:57:27,655 --> 01:57:30,575
Maybe I ought to go back
to Chicago and look after her?

1254
01:57:33,494 --> 01:57:34,953
Sure.

1255
01:57:41,750 --> 01:57:44,377
Well, then I guess
I'll be back before the fight.

1256
01:57:45,920 --> 01:57:48,297
If that?s all right, my husband.

1257
01:58:14,400 --> 01:58:16,360
This fight is no contest!

1258
01:58:16,443 --> 01:58:18,403
He is entirely too slow to fight me.

1259
01:58:18,487 --> 01:58:20,988
I say that George Foreman
is a mummy.

1260
01:58:21,072 --> 01:58:23,950
He's too slow.
You know I name all my fighters.

1261
01:58:24,033 --> 01:58:26,201
I'm gonna call George Foreman
"The Mummy."

1262
01:58:26,243 --> 01:58:28,495
He fight like a mummy.

1263
01:58:32,331 --> 01:58:35,166
And when I see George throwin' punches,
this is what I hear:

1264
01:58:35,250 --> 01:58:37,627
Here come the left.

1265
01:58:37,710 --> 01:58:39,962
Here come the right.

1266
01:58:40,045 --> 01:58:42,714
But the mummy can't hit
what the mummy can't see...

1267
01:58:42,798 --> 01:58:44,674
'cause I'm too fast for him.

1268
01:58:46,259 --> 01:58:49,052
I'm too fast.

1269
01:58:49,136 --> 01:58:53,097
I'm too fast. I'm too fast.
I move too good for him.

1270
01:58:53,180 --> 01:58:56,183
I'll hit George Foreman so many times,
he'll think he's surrounded.

1271
01:58:57,433 --> 01:59:00,854
He gonna say, "Call the police!
It's five of 'em in here!"

1272
01:59:02,521 --> 01:59:04,731
I'm bad, man. I'm bad!

1273
01:59:04,773 --> 01:59:08,651
Muhammad, I'm sorry.
I have to ask.

1274
01:59:09,318 --> 01:59:11,361
Are you really
fast enough anymore...

1275
01:59:11,445 --> 01:59:13,697
to beat George Foreman?

1276
01:59:13,738 --> 01:59:18,576
If he gets you against the ropes,
he can knock you out with either hand.

1277
01:59:18,617 --> 01:59:23,246
Many people believe you?re not the man
you used to be ten years ago.

1278
01:59:26,290 --> 01:59:28,000
See, now, Howard...

1279
01:59:28,083 --> 01:59:31,419
I didn't even want to talk
about this, man.

1280
01:59:32,919 --> 01:59:36,715
Especially not out here
in front of all these people.

1281
01:59:36,756 --> 01:59:39,425
But I talked to your wife...

1282
01:59:39,508 --> 01:59:43,761
and she said you not the man
you used to be two years ago!

1283
02:00:06,237 --> 02:00:08,198
Champ.

1284
02:00:12,284 --> 02:00:15,203
- Champ, George had an accident.
- He-- He had what?

1285
02:00:15,286 --> 02:00:18,079
- What are you talking about?
- He got cut right above his right eye.

1286
02:00:18,163 --> 02:00:20,665
His sparring partner's elbow
split it open.

1287
02:00:20,749 --> 02:00:23,250
- Can he fight?
- Not for six weeks.

1288
02:00:25,211 --> 02:00:27,295
This is not a humorous situation,
my champ.

1289
02:00:27,378 --> 02:00:31,007
This postponement could be long,
especially if George leaves.

1290
02:00:31,090 --> 02:00:33,300
You tying to
pull something here, Don?

1291
02:00:33,383 --> 02:00:36,052
If George leaves, he ain't comin' back.
George don't like it here.

1292
02:00:37,136 --> 02:00:40,764
How right you are, my suspicious
and short Italian brother.

1293
02:00:40,806 --> 02:00:43,558
Look here, man,
my fiduciary responsibility...

1294
02:00:43,642 --> 02:00:46,060
to this first all-black promotion...

1295
02:00:46,143 --> 02:00:49,646
is analogous to a garden in the African
sun-- it must grow, it must bloom.

1296
02:00:49,729 --> 02:00:54,149
Cannot flower in the gloom and shade
of postponement to the Astrodome...

1297
02:00:54,191 --> 02:00:56,985
or any dome out of Zaire where it be
deprivileged of light and bled of water.

1298
02:00:57,027 --> 02:01:00,696
'Cause what gonna be bleedin' out of
there is money-- a hemorrhage of cash.

1299
02:01:00,780 --> 02:01:02,697
I'm talkin' about blood on the floor.

1300
02:01:02,781 --> 02:01:06,284
Double hotel costs, airplane,
travel costs, food and beverage.

1301
02:01:06,368 --> 02:01:10,246
- So what do you want us to do?
- Muhammad Ali. The people's champion.

1302
02:01:10,329 --> 02:01:11,580
My black brother.

1303
02:01:11,663 --> 02:01:14,457
I need you.
I need your strength.

1304
02:01:14,541 --> 02:01:17,793
I need you to find a way
to get George to stay.

1305
02:01:17,835 --> 02:01:20,254
Be Moses in reverse.

1306
02:01:20,337 --> 02:01:24,424
Do not let my people go.
Keep them the fuck right here in Egypt.

1307
02:01:24,507 --> 02:01:26,758
- If you?ll pardon my Swahili.
- Lingala.

1308
02:01:26,842 --> 02:01:29,136
- Say what?
- They speak Lingala.

1309
02:01:30,219 --> 02:01:33,597
Ali wants his title,
and he wants it in Zaire.

1310
02:01:37,559 --> 02:01:40,269
Okay, all right, okay.
Let's take it back.

1311
02:01:40,352 --> 02:01:43,521
George go, George go.
Hell, I can get you Joe Frazier.

1312
02:01:43,604 --> 02:01:46,691
Ali-Frazier 3.
That's the fight everybody want to see.

1313
02:01:46,774 --> 02:01:50,694
- We don't want Frazier, we want George.
- Hell, I don't control George Foreman.

1314
02:02:33,727 --> 02:02:37,897
There's been an accidental injury
to George Foreman in training.

1315
02:02:37,938 --> 02:02:39,732
The truth is...

1316
02:02:39,815 --> 02:02:41,567
George knocked his self out.

1317
02:02:42,609 --> 02:02:44,069
That's right.

1318
02:02:44,110 --> 02:02:47,196
He did three rounds, realized
he was gonna lose to Muhammad Ali...

1319
02:02:47,237 --> 02:02:48,697
and knocked his self out.

1320
02:02:49,698 --> 02:02:52,450
I predict that when the fight is set,
he might not show.

1321
02:02:52,533 --> 02:02:53,659
Oh, you bad.

1322
02:02:53,743 --> 02:02:56,703
- That's right, I'm a bad man.
- Ain't no doubt about that.

1323
02:02:56,787 --> 02:02:59,081
Yeah, but you tell George
the same thing.

1324
02:02:59,164 --> 02:03:01,082
I heard you.
I been watching you.

1325
02:03:01,165 --> 02:03:05,168
I know he's your man, I know you got
him picked, but the man is in trouble.

1326
02:03:05,251 --> 02:03:08,296
The whole world was gonna know,
but now he ain't gonna show.

1327
02:03:09,088 --> 02:03:12,257
In order to ensure that George is ready,
we are thinking of postponing...

1328
02:03:12,299 --> 02:03:15,259
from September 24 to October 30.

1329
02:03:15,343 --> 02:03:17,303
What about the concert?

1330
02:03:17,386 --> 02:03:21,848
The concert will go on as planned.
Those dates are September 20, 21 --

1331
02:03:21,932 --> 02:03:26,227
I want all the helicopters guarded,
all the private planes, private boats.

1332
02:03:26,268 --> 02:03:28,228
I'm serious.
I want the airports--

1333
02:03:28,269 --> 02:03:30,480
I want President Mobutu
and all his paratroopers--

1334
02:03:30,563 --> 02:03:33,315
All you Zaireans,
y'all be on guard too.

1335
02:03:33,399 --> 02:03:37,026
Any strange boats creeping away,
they might be taking him out.

1336
02:03:37,110 --> 02:03:38,486
Bus stations.

1337
02:03:38,569 --> 02:03:40,070
And bus stations!

1338
02:03:40,112 --> 02:03:42,072
Right.
Watch the bus stations.

1339
02:03:42,114 --> 02:03:45,574
The elephant caravans-- They might be
tying to take him out on an elephant.

1340
02:03:45,658 --> 02:03:48,077
- What'd you say?
- Hell, I ain't talking to you.

1341
02:03:48,119 --> 02:03:49,744
Hey. Hey, man.

1342
02:03:50,829 --> 02:03:52,997
Don?t you never talk
to Angelo like that.

1343
02:03:53,081 --> 02:03:56,750
Don?t you never talk to Angie
like that again.

1344
02:03:56,792 --> 02:03:58,626
Something wrong with you, man?

1345
02:04:00,253 --> 02:04:03,672
Think you callin' some shots here?
You ain't callin' nothin'.

1346
02:04:05,674 --> 02:04:08,050
They all know.

1347
02:04:08,134 --> 02:04:11,095
All them ladies out there,
they know I'm ready.

1348
02:04:11,137 --> 02:04:14,347
I see fear in the eyes
of his followers.

1349
02:04:14,431 --> 02:04:18,058
This was supposed to be the fight
that Muhammad Ali was ended.

1350
02:04:18,142 --> 02:04:22,854
Supposed to be Muhammad was gonna fall.
Supposed to be my destruction.

1351
02:04:22,937 --> 02:04:25,439
Well, they miscalculated.
They misjudged.

1352
02:04:25,522 --> 02:04:27,149
They got it wrong.

1353
02:04:50,167 --> 02:04:51,918
Hold on a second.

1354
02:04:53,169 --> 02:04:54,295
What's your name?

1355
02:04:55,796 --> 02:04:56,963
Veronica Porche.

1356
02:04:57,005 --> 02:04:58,965
Porche. Like the sports car.

1357
02:04:59,007 --> 02:05:01,967
- Yes.
- With just a little something extra.

1358
02:05:02,009 --> 02:05:03,510
Hey, you with Don?

1359
02:05:04,595 --> 02:05:08,389
Don brought me here,
but I'm not with anybody, no.

1360
02:05:08,473 --> 02:05:10,849
- Where you come from?
- LA.

1361
02:05:10,932 --> 02:05:13,268
- LA?
- But my people are from Louisiana.

1362
02:05:13,351 --> 02:05:14,685
Louisiana.

1363
02:05:14,769 --> 02:05:16,729
What, you Creole?

1364
02:05:16,812 --> 02:05:21,858
We're Creole,
so I'm African, French and Spanish.

1365
02:05:21,941 --> 02:05:23,984
My mother's grandfather was Jewish.

1366
02:05:24,693 --> 02:05:27,987
Well, they mixed all that stuff up
in there real nice.

1367
02:05:28,029 --> 02:05:30,907
I'm the only witch doctor here.
Bundini Brown.

1368
02:05:30,990 --> 02:05:33,200
Bundini Brown
is an authentic witch doctor.

1369
02:05:33,283 --> 02:05:36,203
- You tell 'em.
- The only one in the United States.

1370
02:05:37,828 --> 02:05:41,207
I'm real glad
you said what you did.

1371
02:05:41,248 --> 02:05:44,542
You made sure the fight stays here.

1372
02:05:47,711 --> 02:05:50,797
You know all them reporters
and writers in there...

1373
02:05:52,090 --> 02:05:54,550
they say George
is gonna kill me.

1374
02:05:55,634 --> 02:05:57,010
What you think?

1375
02:06:01,055 --> 02:06:03,057
Mr. Ali? Mr. Ali?

1376
02:06:03,140 --> 02:06:05,225
- We want thank you.
- Hey, fella.

1377
02:06:05,308 --> 02:06:07,185
Y'all wanna thank me?

1378
02:06:08,395 --> 02:06:10,562
Y'all gonna thank me?
What I did?

1379
02:06:13,564 --> 02:06:16,067
They thanking me for something.

1380
02:06:16,150 --> 02:06:20,404
Hey, you ever been down to Hong Kong?
Thailand? Taiwan?

1381
02:06:20,487 --> 02:06:23,406
- No.
- No? I can't go there.

1382
02:06:24,073 --> 02:06:27,534
- Hi, Ruthie. How are you?
- Hi, champ.

1383
02:06:30,203 --> 02:06:32,162
What's going on?
I'm great. How you feeling?

1384
02:06:32,246 --> 02:06:34,581
When I go to sleep,
this closes up.

1385
02:06:35,665 --> 02:06:39,085
That's what happens. When I go
to sleep, all this rests together.

1386
02:06:39,168 --> 02:06:41,461
During the day, I got to think.

1387
02:06:41,545 --> 02:06:44,922
Get me out of this county.
All the women so pretty.

1388
02:06:45,006 --> 02:06:50,260
All of ?em, they got hair come all
the way down to the back of their knees.

1389
02:06:50,343 --> 02:06:53,929
All of ?em-- All of ?em
about Veronica's complexion.

1390
02:06:54,013 --> 02:06:56,390
Every single one of ?em.
Bad, man.

1391
02:06:58,057 --> 02:07:00,309
But ain't nothing like the sisters.

1392
02:07:01,477 --> 02:07:04,271
Ain't nothing like the sisters.

1393
02:07:08,107 --> 02:07:11,401
Come on. Why don't we go
take a ride or something?

1394
02:07:11,443 --> 02:07:13,028
Wanna come with me?

1395
02:07:22,869 --> 02:07:26,413
Ruth, tell us the truth.
Is this your kind of guy?

1396
02:07:27,122 --> 02:07:28,790
More cushion for the pushin'.

1397
02:07:32,084 --> 02:07:33,294
What'd he say?

1398
02:07:34,627 --> 02:07:36,629
So why you so glad
we still here?

1399
02:07:40,382 --> 02:07:43,801
Making the fight stay here
in Africa--

1400
02:07:45,470 --> 02:07:49,139
Anybody can fight in Vegas.

1401
02:07:55,019 --> 02:07:57,479
Well, that's one job.
I got two.

1402
02:07:57,520 --> 02:07:59,481
Got to whup George.

1403
02:08:07,654 --> 02:08:09,781
Islamic faith help you do that?

1404
02:08:11,073 --> 02:08:14,825
Listen, girl, as a Muslim
I am failed in the eyes of God.

1405
02:08:14,867 --> 02:08:19,162
I should've discovered Islam at 50,
'cause I'm weak on women.

1406
02:08:20,413 --> 02:08:22,582
First they take my eyes.

1407
02:08:22,666 --> 02:08:25,125
My heart follow.

1408
02:08:25,167 --> 02:08:27,336
Making me the lovingest husband
in the world...

1409
02:08:27,419 --> 02:08:30,338
and the most terriblest husband
at the same time.

1410
02:08:32,964 --> 02:08:34,675
Look at you.

1411
02:08:34,716 --> 02:08:37,093
Green eyes.

1412
02:08:37,176 --> 02:08:38,969
Cocoa skin.

1413
02:08:40,054 --> 02:08:42,347
Okay, rest of me, let's go.

1414
02:08:50,311 --> 02:08:51,396
Rumble, Ali.

1415
02:09:35,180 --> 02:09:37,515
- Mrs. Ali.
- Hello, Muhammad, Mr. Cosell.

1416
02:09:37,557 --> 02:09:40,392
- Hey, when you get in?
- Today.

1417
02:09:40,475 --> 02:09:43,895
And I learned we now have this suite
at the intercontinental Hotel.

1418
02:09:45,396 --> 02:09:47,773
Muhammad, may I have
a word with you, please?

1419
02:09:47,857 --> 02:09:49,274
Yeah.

1420
02:09:58,197 --> 02:09:59,449
What's goin' on?

1421
02:09:59,532 --> 02:10:01,951
What do you mean,
what's goin' on?

1422
02:10:02,035 --> 02:10:04,494
Do you have to throw it
in my face?

1423
02:10:04,578 --> 02:10:08,164
Do I have to read about it? Do people
have to call me on the phone to tell me?

1424
02:10:08,247 --> 02:10:10,166
I didn't mean for that
to come out.

1425
02:10:10,249 --> 02:10:14,002
And I live with the casual ones.
I live with 'em.

1426
02:10:14,085 --> 02:10:16,920
So why do you
disrespect me like this?

1427
02:10:17,004 --> 02:10:20,632
I respect you.
I will always respect you.

1428
02:10:30,431 --> 02:10:32,058
Do you love her?

1429
02:10:37,604 --> 02:10:39,063
I don't know.

1430
02:10:45,818 --> 02:10:48,403
So what is supposed to happen now?

1431
02:10:50,238 --> 02:10:52,156
I fight George.

1432
02:10:53,741 --> 02:10:56,409
I didn't come all this far to lose.

1433
02:10:59,079 --> 02:11:00,497
Neither did l.

1434
02:11:26,767 --> 02:11:28,184
Belinda.

1435
02:11:32,646 --> 02:11:34,064
What, Bingham?

1436
02:15:09,315 --> 02:15:10,566
There it is.

1437
02:15:24,535 --> 02:15:26,912
Hey, Zack, where's George?

1438
02:15:26,995 --> 02:15:28,455
What's he pulling?

1439
02:15:28,496 --> 02:15:30,373
Where's George?
Where'd he go?

1440
02:15:31,457 --> 02:15:34,710
I just wanna make sure
you're gonna control the evening.

1441
02:15:35,460 --> 02:15:38,379
George is jerking us off,
making us wait.

1442
02:17:16,747 --> 02:17:20,458
It's all over for you, man.
You don't have a chance.

1443
02:17:21,585 --> 02:17:23,586
You don't have no chance.

1444
02:17:23,669 --> 02:17:25,713
The rumble in the jungle!

1445
02:17:25,796 --> 02:17:27,881
You don't have no chance, man.

1446
02:17:27,964 --> 02:17:29,048
Okay, let's go.

1447
02:17:29,799 --> 02:17:32,467
You guys know the rules.
I want a good, clean fight.

1448
02:17:32,551 --> 02:17:35,095
Ali, be quiet
and listen to the instructions.

1449
02:17:35,178 --> 02:17:37,179
You been hearing about me
ever since you was a boy.

1450
02:17:37,263 --> 02:17:39,682
Ali, be quiet.
Listen to the instructions.

1451
02:17:39,765 --> 02:17:42,017
- Now you got to face me.
- No hitting low.

1452
02:17:42,100 --> 02:17:44,519
- When I tell you to break--
- You got to face me now.

1453
02:17:44,603 --> 02:17:46,562
Be quiet,
or I'll disqualify you.

1454
02:17:46,645 --> 02:17:49,607
When I tell you to break,
I want a clean break. Understand?

1455
02:17:49,648 --> 02:17:53,234
- You shoulda never came to Africa.
- All right, shake hands.

1456
02:17:53,318 --> 02:17:55,277
Take your corners.

1457
02:17:55,319 --> 02:17:57,404
Okay. All right.
No problem.

1458
02:18:41,188 --> 02:18:42,648
Break!

1459
02:18:52,322 --> 02:18:54,448
All right, break. Step back.

1460
02:19:26,014 --> 02:19:28,933
Take it to him!
That's what we came to do, Daddy!

1461
02:19:40,818 --> 02:19:42,777
The heavyweight championship fight...

1462
02:19:42,861 --> 02:19:45,488
- That's all you got?
- ive via satellite...

1463
02:19:45,530 --> 02:19:47,489
direct from Zaire, Africa.

1464
02:19:49,992 --> 02:19:52,910
- There we go.
- That's it, Daddy.

1465
02:19:52,994 --> 02:19:55,705
You just keep dancing
around him, okay?

1466
02:19:56,538 --> 02:19:58,165
Just keep moving.

1467
02:20:05,879 --> 02:20:07,714
Legs hurting.

1468
02:20:08,798 --> 02:20:10,257
Air heavy...

1469
02:20:10,340 --> 02:20:12,342
Like I'm in water.

1470
02:20:33,275 --> 02:20:35,277
Get away from the rope!

1471
02:20:36,861 --> 02:20:39,864
Get off the rope!
Get off there! Move it!

1472
02:20:42,240 --> 02:20:44,951
Get off there! Get off there!

1473
02:20:53,458 --> 02:20:55,375
Get off the rope!

1474
02:20:59,462 --> 02:21:00,713
Get off them ropes!

1475
02:21:01,589 --> 02:21:05,550
Come on now, Ali,
get off the ropes!

1476
02:21:05,592 --> 02:21:07,052
Come on, baby!

1477
02:21:08,135 --> 02:21:09,970
Come on, Ali!

1478
02:21:11,805 --> 02:21:14,766
That's it?
That's all you got? That's it?

1479
02:21:20,479 --> 02:21:22,897
Move him out to the center!

1480
02:21:22,939 --> 02:21:24,565
There he goes!

1481
02:21:26,566 --> 02:21:29,903
Get away from the ropes!
Get off the ropes!

1482
02:22:03,554 --> 02:22:06,140
Been here before.

1483
02:22:06,222 --> 02:22:08,224
Little greenroom.

1484
02:22:08,307 --> 02:22:10,851
Open that door.
Gonna get out this place.

1485
02:22:10,934 --> 02:22:13,520
Come on, man,
get up and get out.

1486
02:22:28,781 --> 02:22:31,617
They said you could punch, George.

1487
02:22:31,659 --> 02:22:34,369
You ain't hittin'.
You hittin' like a sissy, George.

1488
02:22:35,996 --> 02:22:38,247
You can't lay up on the ropes
like that.

1489
02:22:39,290 --> 02:22:43,668
You're letting him beat on you.
You can't do that, champ. Come on, now.

1490
02:22:43,710 --> 02:22:47,463
-You wanna explain that to me?
-Jab, then go to the middle of the ring.

1491
02:22:47,504 --> 02:22:50,883
- You had your fight going, then--
- You gotta dance, baby.

1492
02:22:50,966 --> 02:22:54,343
Shut up! Just be quiet!
You let me take care of this!

1493
02:22:54,385 --> 02:22:57,637
Got to dance.
You can't come out there like that.

1494
02:22:57,679 --> 02:22:59,639
- You can't back up.
- You got to respect the man.

1495
02:22:59,681 --> 02:23:03,601
What is with the ropes? Something
going on you wanna talk to me about?

1496
02:23:03,684 --> 02:23:06,644
Tell me what's going on with you.
What are you doing?

1497
02:23:06,728 --> 02:23:10,522
Put the jab on him.
You got to let him go and dance.

1498
02:23:10,564 --> 02:23:14,108
Don't let him get in your corner.
He's tying to cut the ring off you.

1499
02:23:14,192 --> 02:23:18,029
He's tying to cut you off the ring.
You can't let that happen.

1500
02:23:19,196 --> 02:23:21,448
Just take care of it!

1501
02:23:24,158 --> 02:23:27,368
And there's the bell.
The fighters meet in mid-ring.

1502
02:23:37,376 --> 02:23:38,878
Get off the ropes!

1503
02:23:38,920 --> 02:23:40,796
Stay off the ropes!

1504
02:23:42,506 --> 02:23:45,841
Foreman again
pushing him against the ropes.

1505
02:23:45,883 --> 02:23:50,345
And Ali laying back, fighting those
blows against the sides of his body.

1506
02:23:50,386 --> 02:23:53,014
Get back in the middle
of the ring, Ali!

1507
02:23:54,057 --> 02:23:56,350
Muhammad, get off the ropes!

1508
02:24:28,416 --> 02:24:32,044
You're punching like a sissy, George.
Punching like a sissy.

1509
02:24:44,220 --> 02:24:46,389
What the hell's going on?
Come on.

1510
02:24:58,440 --> 02:25:02,067
George, get him back.
What the hell's going on? Come on.

1511
02:25:14,161 --> 02:25:16,912
You got to get off the ropes!

1512
02:25:16,954 --> 02:25:18,539
Get off the ropes!

1513
02:25:18,622 --> 02:25:21,541
Eight rounds to go.
Running out of gas, big fella?

1514
02:25:22,709 --> 02:25:24,126
Let him go.

1515
02:25:37,095 --> 02:25:41,015
Can't let you get that second wind which
you don't even know is there for you.

1516
02:25:41,098 --> 02:25:44,267
You want the title?
Want to wear the heavyweight crown?

1517
02:25:44,309 --> 02:25:47,478
Nose broke, jaw smashed,
face busted in.

1518
02:25:47,561 --> 02:25:49,480
You ready for that?
Is that you?

1519
02:25:49,563 --> 02:25:52,982
'Cause you facing a man who will die
before he lets you win.

1520
02:26:05,325 --> 02:26:08,244
Ali, don't let him beat on you
on the inside.

1521
02:26:09,369 --> 02:26:11,330
Don't let him beat on you
on the inside.

1522
02:26:20,003 --> 02:26:21,338
Come on, Ali.

1523
02:26:23,339 --> 02:26:25,549
Let's go, Ali.

1524
02:26:25,633 --> 02:26:28,843
Let's go, baby!
Stay off the ropes!

1525
02:26:28,885 --> 02:26:30,220
Get off the ropes!

1526
02:26:30,303 --> 02:26:32,596
There it is.
Keep 'em in his face.

1527
02:26:34,223 --> 02:26:35,224
Break!

1528
02:26:35,307 --> 02:26:37,433
Oh, you missed him, George!

1529
02:26:37,517 --> 02:26:39,644
You gotta go to work on him, Ali!

1530
02:26:48,192 --> 02:26:51,152
I thought you could punch, George.
They said you could punch.

1531
02:26:51,194 --> 02:26:52,654
Come on, Ali!

1532
02:26:53,863 --> 02:26:56,615
Get away from the rope!
Get off the rope!

1533
02:26:56,698 --> 02:26:58,117
He got him!

1534
02:27:04,621 --> 02:27:06,540
Move him around! Take him!

1535
02:27:07,748 --> 02:27:09,208
Come on, Ali!

1536
02:27:16,256 --> 02:27:19,466
Get off the ropes!
Get off the ropes!

1537
02:27:20,634 --> 02:27:22,009
Get off the ropes!

1538
02:28:07,086 --> 02:28:10,048
George Foreman is hit
by a combination of punches...

1539
02:28:10,089 --> 02:28:11,590
and down he goes!

1540
02:28:11,631 --> 02:28:13,383
George Foreman is down!

1541
02:28:13,425 --> 02:28:16,510
He's fallen
like a tree in the forest!

1542
02:28:16,594 --> 02:28:19,929
He is felled by a combination of blows
from Muhammad Ali!

1543
02:28:38,069 --> 02:28:41,280
Okay, this fight's over!
This fight's over!

1544
02:28:53,664 --> 02:28:56,249
I told you! I told you!

1545
02:29:06,174 --> 02:29:09,718
Referee Zack Clayton is counting.
Seven, eight!

1546
02:29:09,802 --> 02:29:11,762
And he's on his knee.
It is over!

1547
02:29:11,845 --> 02:29:13,888
It is over! It is over!

1548
02:29:13,971 --> 02:29:15,431
It is over!

1549
02:29:15,473 --> 02:29:19,518
George Foreman has been knocked out
by Muhammad Ali!

1550
02:29:19,601 --> 02:29:22,104
Muhammad Ali
has done the impossible!

1551
02:29:22,145 --> 02:29:24,563
He has regained
the heavyweight crown...

1552
02:29:24,647 --> 02:29:29,109
that was taken unjustly
from him in 1967.

1553
02:29:31,985 --> 02:29:34,613
What a moment of history
in this arena...

1554
02:29:34,697 --> 02:29:37,156
in Zaire, Africa!

1555
02:29:47,123 --> 02:29:49,624
A tremendous, tremendous moment.

1555
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:53,074
