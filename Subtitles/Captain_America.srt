00:01:13,623 --> 00:01:15,147
Are you the guys from Washington?

3
00:01:15,258 --> 00:01:17,055
You get many other visitors out here?

4
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,718
How long you been on-site?

5
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:20,193
Since this morning.

6
00:01:20,296 --> 00:01:22,924
A Russian oil team
called it in about 18 hours ago.

7
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,532
How come nobody spotted it before?

8
00:01:25,635 --> 00:01:27,330
It's really not that surprising.

9
00:01:27,804 --> 00:01:29,931
This landscape's changing all the time.

10
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:31,870
You got any idea
what this thing is exactly?

11
00:01:31,974 --> 00:01:34,033
I don't know.
It's probably a weather balloon.

12
00:01:34,143 --> 00:01:35,474
I don't think so.

13
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:37,603
You know, we don't have
the equipment for a job like this.

14
00:01:37,947 --> 00:01:40,347
How long before
we can start craning it out?

15
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:42,345
I don't think you quite understand.

16
00:01:42,718 --> 00:01:45,380
You guys are gonna need
one hell of a crane.

17
00:02:31,934 --> 00:02:33,902
<i>Base, we're in.</i>

18
00:02:40,009 --> 00:02:41,306
<i>What is this?</i>

19
00:02:56,626 --> 00:02:57,752
<i>Careful.</i>

20
00:03:18,648 --> 00:03:19,945
<i>Lieutenant!</i>

21
00:03:23,052 --> 00:03:24,349
<i>What is it?</i>

22
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,017
<i>My God.</i>

23
00:03:26,322 --> 00:03:28,790
<i>Base, get me a line to the Colonel.</i>

24
00:03:29,525 --> 00:03:30,958
<i>It's 3:00 a.m., sir.</i>

25
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:35,622
<i>I don't care what time it is.
This one's waited long enough.</i>

26
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:48,559
Open it!

27
00:04:50,473 --> 00:04:52,031
Quickly, before he...

28
00:05:04,086 --> 00:05:07,886
It has taken me a long time
to find this place.

29
00:05:10,426 --> 00:05:12,155
You should be commended.

30
00:05:12,261 --> 00:05:13,250
Help him up.

31
00:05:17,767 --> 00:05:21,168
I think that you are
a man of great vision.

32
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,700
And, in this way, we are much alike.

33
00:05:23,806 --> 00:05:25,239
I am nothing like you.

34
00:05:25,341 --> 00:05:26,865
No, of course, but

35
00:05:27,543 --> 00:05:32,503
what others see as superstition,
you and I know to be a science.

36
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,879
What you seek is just a legend.

37
00:05:34,984 --> 00:05:37,509
Then why make such an effort
to conceal it?

38
00:05:57,907 --> 00:06:02,708
The Tesseract was the jewel
of Odin's treasure room.

39
00:06:07,783 --> 00:06:10,411
It is not something one buries.

40
00:06:11,153 --> 00:06:15,214
But I think it is close, yes?

41
00:06:15,991 --> 00:06:17,288
I cannot help you.

42
00:06:17,593 --> 00:06:21,996
No. But maybe
you can help your village.

43
00:06:22,398 --> 00:06:27,358
You must have some friends out there.
Some little grandchildren, perhaps?

44
00:06:28,104 --> 00:06:30,470
I have no need for them to die.

45
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,211
Yggdrasil.

46
00:06:47,022 --> 00:06:49,490
Tree of the world.

47
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:53,454
Guardian of wisdom.

48
00:06:55,431 --> 00:06:57,399
And fate, also.

49
00:07:28,397 --> 00:07:33,027
<i>And the Führer digs for trinkets
in the desert.</i>

50
00:07:36,472 --> 00:07:39,441
You have never seen this, have you?

51
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:43,504
It's not for the eyes of ordinary men.

52
00:07:43,746 --> 00:07:45,213
Exactly.

53
00:07:48,584 --> 00:07:50,711
Give the order to open fire.

54
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,085
Fool!

55
00:07:53,722 --> 00:07:56,020
You cannot control the power you hold.

56
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:57,149
You will burn!

57
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,989
I already have.

58
00:08:12,441 --> 00:08:14,409
<i>O'Connell, Michael.</i>

59
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:17,269
Kaminsky, Henry.

60
00:08:17,613 --> 00:08:19,604
Boy, a lot of guys
getting killed over there.

61
00:08:19,915 --> 00:08:21,542
Rogers, Steven.

62
00:08:22,618 --> 00:08:25,416
It kind of makes you think twice
about enlisting, huh?

63
00:08:25,955 --> 00:08:27,081
Nope.

64
00:08:30,059 --> 00:08:31,526
Rogers.

65
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,360
- What did your father die of?
- Mustard gas.

66
00:08:41,237 --> 00:08:44,400
He was in the 107th Infantry.
I was hoping I could be assigned...

67
00:08:44,506 --> 00:08:47,202
- Your mother?
- She was a nurse in a TB ward.

68
00:08:47,409 --> 00:08:49,400
Got hit. Couldn't shake it.

69
00:08:53,983 --> 00:08:56,008
- Sorry, son.
- Look, just give me a chance.

70
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,678
You'd be ineligible
on your asthma alone.

71
00:08:59,154 --> 00:09:00,178
Is there anything you can do?

72
00:09:00,689 --> 00:09:01,986
I'm doing it.

73
00:09:02,424 --> 00:09:03,686
I'm saving your life.

74
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:10,198
<i>War continues to ravage Europe.</i>

75
00:09:11,233 --> 00:09:13,201
<i>But help is on the way.</i>

76
00:09:13,969 --> 00:09:18,599
<i>Every able-bodied young man is

<i>Even little Timmy is doing his part</i>

78
00:09:24,346 --> 00:09:26,314
<i>collecting scrap metal.</i>

79
00:09:26,548 --> 00:09:27,537
<i>Nice work, Timmy!</i>

80
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,912
Who cares?

81
00:09:30,085 --> 00:09:31,677
Play the movie already!

82
00:09:31,787 --> 00:09:33,482
Hey, you wanna show some respect?

83
00:09:33,756 --> 00:09:34,950
<i>Meanwhile, overseas,</i>

84
00:09:35,057 --> 00:09:38,117
<i>our brave boys are showing

85
00:09:38,227 --> 00:09:39,956
<i>of freedom is never too high.</i>

86
00:09:40,062 --> 00:09:42,360
Let's go! Get on with it!

87
00:09:43,299 --> 00:09:45,028
Hey, just start the cartoon!

88
00:09:45,134 --> 00:09:46,260
Hey, you wanna shut up?

89
00:09:47,202 --> 00:09:49,830
<i>Together with Allied forces,
we'll face any threat,</i>

90
00:09:49,938 --> 00:09:51,269
<i>no matter the size.</i>

91
00:10:08,724 --> 00:10:10,487
You just don't know when to give up,
do you?

92
00:10:11,226 --> 00:10:13,023
I can do this all day.

93
00:10:17,433 --> 00:10:18,661
Hey!

94
00:10:18,767 --> 00:10:20,234
Pick on someone your own size.

95
00:10:28,477 --> 00:10:31,446
Sometimes I think
you like getting punched.

96
00:10:32,147 --> 00:10:33,774
I had him on the ropes.

97
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:36,015
How many times is this?

98
00:10:37,252 --> 00:10:39,379
You're from Paramus now?

99
00:10:39,655 --> 00:10:42,385
You know it's illegal to lie
on the enlistment form.

100
00:10:42,491 --> 00:10:43,958
And seriously, Jersey?

101
00:10:45,794 --> 00:10:47,193
You get your orders?

102
00:10:49,798 --> 00:10:50,856
The 107th.

103
00:10:51,266 --> 00:10:52,665
Sergeant James Barnes,

104
00:10:52,768 --> 00:10:55,134
shipping out for England
first thing tomorrow.

105
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,132
I should be going.

106
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:04,735
Come on, man.

107
00:11:05,514 --> 00:11:08,415
My last night!
I got to get you cleaned up.

108
00:11:08,517 --> 00:11:10,041
Why? Where are we going?

109
00:11:10,185 --> 00:11:11,482
The future.

110
00:11:16,358 --> 00:11:18,383
I don't see what the problem is.

111
00:11:18,494 --> 00:11:21,088
You're about to be
the last eligible man in New York.

112
00:11:21,363 --> 00:11:23,695
You know there's
three and a half million women here?

113
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:25,027
Well, I'd settle for just one.

114
00:11:26,034 --> 00:11:27,467
Good thing I took care of that.

115
00:11:28,103 --> 00:11:29,161
Hey, Bucky!

116
00:11:31,507 --> 00:11:33,566
What'd you tell her about me?

117
00:11:33,809 --> 00:11:35,640
Only the good stuff.

118
00:11:36,845 --> 00:11:39,905

Hey, Steve, what do you say
we treat these girls...

133
00:13:15,777 --> 00:13:17,574
Come on, soldier.

134
00:13:22,518 --> 00:13:24,645
Come on. You're kind of
missing the point of a double date.

135
00:13:24,753 --> 00:13:26,220
We're taking the girls dancing.

136
00:13:26,321 --> 00:13:28,346
You go ahead. I'll catch up with you.

137
00:13:31,326 --> 00:13:33,317
You're really going to do this again?

138
00:13:33,428 --> 00:13:34,918
Well, it's a fair. I'm gonna try my luck.

139
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,725
As who, Steve from Ohio?

140
00:13:36,832 --> 00:13:39,164
They'll catch you.
Or worse, they'll actually take you.

141
00:13:39,868 --> 00:13:41,165
Look, I know
you don't think I can do this.

142
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,635
This isn't a back alley, Steve. It's war.

143
00:13:42,938 --> 00:13:44,701
- I know it's a war.
- Why are you so keen to fight?

144
00:13:44,806 --> 00:13:46,637
- There are so many important jobs.
- What do you want me to do?

145
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,676
Collect scrap metal
in my little red wagon?

146
00:13:48,777 --> 00:13:50,369
- Yes. Why not?
- I'm not gonna sit in a factory, Bucky.

147
00:13:50,479 --> 00:13:53,039
Bucky, come on.
There are men laying down their lives.

148
00:13:54,049 --> 00:13:56,176
I got no right to do any less than them.

149
00:13:56,285 --> 00:13:58,913
That's what you don't understand.
This isn't about me.

150
00:13:59,388 --> 00:14:02,482
Right. 'Cause you got nothing to prove.

151
00:14:05,394 --> 00:14:08,227
Hey, Sarge! Are we going dancing?

152
00:14:09,498 --> 00:14:11,261
Yes, we are.

153
00:14:17,105 --> 00:14:19,335
Don't do anything stupid until I get back.

154
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:20,465
How can I?

155
00:14:20,909 --> 00:14:22,774
You're taking all the stupid with you.

156
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,108
- You're a punk.
- Jerk.

157
00:14:28,884 --> 00:14:30,579
Be careful.

158
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,480
Don't win the war till I get there!

159
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:43,530
Come on, girls.
They're playing our song.

160
00:15:03,085 --> 00:15:04,313
Wait here.

161
00:15:05,354 --> 00:15:07,754
- Is there a problem?
- Just wait here.

162
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,005
Thank you.

163
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:32,905
So,

164
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:37,085
you want to go overseas.
Kill some Nazis.

165
00:15:38,453 --> 00:15:39,750
Excuse me?

166
00:15:40,122 --> 00:15:41,714
Dr. Abraham Erskine.

167
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:44,519
I represent
the Strategic Scientific Reserve.

168
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,952
Steve Rogers.

169
00:15:50,465 --> 00:15:52,023
Where are you from?

170
00:15:52,467 --> 00:15:56,597
Queens. 73rd Street
and Utopia Parkway.

171
00:15:57,072 --> 00:15:59,040
Before that, Germany.

172
00:16:00,075 --> 00:16:01,940
- This troubles you?
- No.

173
00:16:02,944 --> 00:16:05,071
Where are you from, Mr. Rogers?

174
00:16:05,414 --> 00:16:07,109
Is it New Haven?

175
00:16:08,216 --> 00:16:09,615
Or Paramus?

176
00:16:10,652 --> 00:16:12,882
Five exams in five different cities.

177
00:16:12,988 --> 00:16:14,012
That might not be the right file.

178
00:16:14,122 --> 00:16:15,953
No, it's not the exams I'm interested in.

179
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,185
It's the five tries.

180
00:16:19,261 --> 00:16:23,391
But you didn't answer my question.
Do you want to kill Nazis?

181
00:16:26,368 --> 00:16:27,357
Is this a test?

182
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,067
Yes.

183
00:16:33,175 --> 00:16:34,802
I don't want to kill anyone.

184
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:38,671
I don't like bullies.
I don't care where they're from.

185
00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:41,677
Well, there are already

186
00:16:41,783 --> 00:16:43,717
so many big men fighting this war.

187
00:16:43,985 --> 00:16:45,782
Maybe what we need now is a little guy.

188
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:49,623
I can offer you a chance.

189
00:16:51,026 --> 00:16:52,891
Only a chance.

190
00:16:52,994 --> 00:16:54,723
- I'll take it.
- Good.

191
00:16:55,964 --> 00:16:59,764
So where is
the little guy from? Actually?

192
00:17:00,802 --> 00:17:02,099
Brooklyn.

193
00:17:04,272 --> 00:17:06,740
Congratulations, soldier.

194
00:17:30,899 --> 00:17:33,026
Are you ready, Dr. Zola?

195
00:17:34,503 --> 00:17:38,132
My machine requires
the most delicate calibration.

196
00:17:39,741 --> 00:17:41,732
Forgive me if I seem overcautious.

197
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,437
Are you certain
that those conductors of yours

198
00:17:44,546 --> 00:17:48,607
can withstand the energy surge
long enough for transference?

199
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:50,283
With this artifact

200
00:17:50,952 --> 00:17:52,283
I am certain of nothing.

201
00:17:52,587 --> 00:17:54,953
I fear it may not work at all.

202
00:18:32,093 --> 00:18:33,287
Twenty percent.

203
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:36,861
Forty.

204
00:18:39,568 --> 00:18:40,899
Sixty.

205
00:18:43,772 --> 00:18:45,603
Stabilizing at 70%.

206
00:18:47,809 --> 00:18:51,438
I have not come all this way
for safety, Doctor.

207
00:19:09,998 --> 00:19:11,556
What was that?

208
00:19:12,167 --> 00:19:15,261
I must congratulate you, Arnim.

209
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:18,533
Your designs do not disappoint.

210
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,940
Though they may require
some slight reinforcement.

211
00:19:23,712 --> 00:19:25,942
The exchange is stable.

212
00:19:26,514 --> 00:19:27,981
Amazing!

213
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,675
The energy we have just collected

214
00:19:30,785 --> 00:19:33,720
could power my designs.
All my designs.

215
00:19:35,891 --> 00:19:38,689
This will change the war.

216
00:19:39,427 --> 00:19:41,156
Dr. Zola,

217
00:19:42,564 --> 00:19:45,499
this will change the world.

218
00:19:48,036 --> 00:19:49,901
Ready, exercise!

219
00:19:50,005 --> 00:19:51,768
Recruits, attention!

220
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:54,298
Gentlemen, I am Agent Carter.

221
00:19:54,676 --> 00:19:57,270
I supervise all operations
for this division.

222
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,510
What's with the accent, Queen Victoria?

223
00:20:00,715 --> 00:20:02,706
I thought I was signing up
for the U.S. Army.

224
00:20:02,884 --> 00:20:03,942
What's your name, soldier?

225
00:20:04,386 --> 00:20:06,047
Gilmore Hodge, Your Majesty.

226
00:20:06,154 --> 00:20:07,849
Step forward, Hodge.

227
00:20:09,624 --> 00:20:10,989
Put your right foot forward.

228
00:20:12,427 --> 00:20:13,758
We gonna wrassle?

229
00:20:15,597 --> 00:20:17,963
'Cause I got a few moves
I know you'll like.

230
00:20:20,835 --> 00:20:22,097
Agent Carter!

231
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,835
Colonel Phillips.

232
00:20:23,939 --> 00:20:26,908
I can see that you are
breaking in the candidates. That's good!

233
00:20:27,642 --> 00:20:28,904
Get your ass up out of that dirt

234
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,740
and stand in that line at attention till
somebody comes tells you what to do.

235
00:20:31,846 --> 00:20:33,279
Yes, sir!

236
00:20:36,618 --> 00:20:38,916
General Patton has said

237
00:20:39,487 --> 00:20:43,116
that wars are fought with weapons,
but they are won by men.

238
00:20:43,224 --> 00:20:46,751
We are going to win this war
because we have the best men.

239
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,327
And because they are
going to get better.

240
00:20:53,435 --> 00:20:55,403
Much better.

241
00:20:56,237 --> 00:20:59,968
<i>The Strategic Scientific Reserve
is an Allied effort</i>

242
00:21:00,108 --> 00:21:03,100
<i>made up of
the best minds in the free world.</i>

243
00:21:03,611 --> 00:21:06,705
<i>Our goal is
to create the best army in history.</i>

244
00:21:07,282 --> 00:21:09,147
<i>But every army starts with one man.</i>

245
00:21:09,584 --> 00:21:11,381
Rogers! Get off of there!

246
00:21:11,486 --> 00:21:13,579
<i>At the end of this week,
we will choose that man.</i>

247
00:21:14,155 --> 00:21:17,784
He will be the first
in a new breed of super-soldier.

248
00:21:24,065 --> 00:21:26,431
Rogers! Get that rifle out of the mud!

249
00:21:26,534 --> 00:21:31,164
And they will personally escort
Adolf Hitler to the gates of hell.

250
00:21:31,506 --> 00:21:33,633
Pick up the pace, ladies!

251
00:21:34,309 --> 00:21:37,767
Let's go, let's go! Double time!

252
00:21:38,113 --> 00:21:40,911
Come on! Faster! Faster!

253
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,681
Move! Move!

254
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:46,020
Squad, halt!

255
00:21:46,688 --> 00:21:48,918
That flag means
we're only at the halfway point.

256
00:21:49,657 --> 00:21:53,058
First man to bring it to me
gets a ride back with Agent Carter.

257
00:21:53,161 --> 00:21:54,856
Move, move!

258
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:57,627
Come on! Get up there!

259
00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:00,595
If that's all you got,
this army's in trouble!

260
00:22:00,702 --> 00:22:02,260
Get up there, Hodge!

261
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:04,902
Come on! Get up there!

262
00:22:06,574 --> 00:22:09,008
Nobody's got that flag in 17 years!

263
00:22:10,845 --> 00:22:13,973
Now fall back into line! Come on, fall in!

264
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:16,346
Let's go! Get back into formation!

265
00:22:18,887 --> 00:22:21,082
Rogers! I said fall in!

266
00:22:37,372 --> 00:22:38,896
Thank you, sir.

267
00:22:47,715 --> 00:22:49,910
Faster, ladies! Come on.

268
00:22:50,218 --> 00:22:52,516
My grandmother has more life in her,
God rest her soul.

269
00:22:53,988 --> 00:22:54,977
Move it!

270
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:57,217
You're not really thinking
about picking Rogers, are you?

271
00:22:57,325 --> 00:23:00,226
I'm more than just thinking about it.
He is the clear choice.

272
00:23:00,328 --> 00:23:03,627
When you brought a 90-pound
asthmatic onto my army base,

273
00:23:03,731 --> 00:23:05,130
I let it slide. I thought, "What the hell."

274
00:23:05,233 --> 00:23:06,928
Maybe he'd be useful to you,
like a gerbil.

275
00:23:07,035 --> 00:23:08,059
I never thought you'd pick him.

276
00:23:08,169 --> 00:23:09,329
Up.

277
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,172
You stick a needle in that kid's arm,
it's gonna go right through him.

278
00:23:14,275 --> 00:23:16,743
- Come on, girls.
- Look at that.

279
00:23:17,712 --> 00:23:19,077
He's making me cry.

280
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,740
I am looking for qualities
beyond the physical.

281
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:24,444
Do you know how long it took
to set up this project?

282
00:23:24,552 --> 00:23:25,644
All the groveling I had to do

283
00:23:25,753 --> 00:23:26,913
in front of Senator
What's-His-Name's committees?

284
00:23:27,021 --> 00:23:29,216
Brandt. Yes, I know.
I am well aware of your efforts.

285
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:32,555
Then throw me a bone.
Hodge passed every test we gave him.

286
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,560
He's big, he's fast. He obeys orders.

287
00:23:34,662 --> 00:23:36,095
- He's a soldier.
- He is a bully.

288
00:23:36,364 --> 00:23:39,094
You don't win wars
with niceness, Doctor.

289
00:23:42,437 --> 00:23:45,235
You win wars with guts.

290
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:48,535
Grenade!

291
00:23:53,081 --> 00:23:54,378
Get away!

292
00:23:54,916 --> 00:23:56,281
Get back!

293
00:24:03,591 --> 00:24:05,115
It was a dummy grenade.

294
00:24:06,227 --> 00:24:08,218
All clear. Back in formation.

295
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:13,592
Is this a test?

296
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,496
He's still skinny.

297
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:26,707
- May I?
- Yeah.

298
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:31,348
Can't sleep?

299
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,817
I got the jitters, I guess.

300
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:35,686
Me, too.

301
00:24:37,492 --> 00:24:39,016
Can I ask you a question?

302
00:24:39,127 --> 00:24:40,492
Just one?

303
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:44,129
Why me?

304
00:24:47,168 --> 00:24:49,966
I suppose that is
the only question that matters.

305
00:24:53,174 --> 00:24:56,143
This is from Augsburg. My city.

306
00:24:58,846 --> 00:24:59,870
So many people forget

307
00:24:59,981 --> 00:25:02,449
that the first country the Nazis invaded
was their own.

308
00:25:03,184 --> 00:25:06,585
You know, after the last war,
my people struggled.

309
00:25:06,688 --> 00:25:09,589
They felt weak. They felt small.

310
00:25:09,691 --> 00:25:11,420
And then Hitler comes along
with the marching

311
00:25:11,526 --> 00:25:14,518
and the big show and the flags.

312
00:25:15,863 --> 00:25:19,856
And he hears of me. My work.
And he finds me.

313
00:25:19,968 --> 00:25:21,265
And he says, "You."

314
00:25:22,203 --> 00:25:23,966
He says, "You will make us strong."

315
00:25:24,739 --> 00:25:27,367
Well, I am not interested.

316
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:31,142
So he sends the head of Hydra,

317
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,581
his research division.

318
00:25:33,881 --> 00:25:36,509
A brilliant scientist by the name
of Johann Schmidt.

319
00:25:36,784 --> 00:25:39,218
Now, Schmidt is
a member of the inner circle.

320
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,617
And he is ambitious.

321
00:25:41,055 --> 00:25:46,322
<i>He and Hitler share a passion for
occult power and Teutonic myth.</i>

322
00:25:47,095 --> 00:25:50,087
Hitler uses his fantasies
to inspire his followers.

323
00:25:50,198 --> 00:25:51,961
But for Schmidt, it is not fantasy.

324
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:55,459
For him, it is real.
He has become convinced

325
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:58,095
that there is a great power
hidden in the earth,

326
00:25:58,206 --> 00:25:59,434
<i>left here by the gods,</i>

327
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:02,338
waiting to be seized by a superior man.

328
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:07,938
So when he hears about my formula
and what it can do, he cannot resist.

329
00:26:10,985 --> 00:26:13,545
<i>Schmidt must become
that superior man.</i>

330
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,352
Did it make him stronger?

331
00:26:20,595 --> 00:26:21,823
Yes.

332
00:26:22,263 --> 00:26:25,164
But there were other effects.

333
00:26:29,637 --> 00:26:30,763
The serum was not ready.

334
00:26:32,006 --> 00:26:34,975
But more important, the man.

335
00:26:35,943 --> 00:26:38,207
The serum amplifies
everything that is inside,

336
00:26:38,313 --> 00:26:41,441
so good becomes great.

337
00:26:41,549 --> 00:26:43,244
Bad becomes worse.

338
00:26:48,556 --> 00:26:50,148
This is why you were chosen.

339
00:26:51,292 --> 00:26:54,819
Because a strong man
who has known power all his life

340
00:26:54,929 --> 00:26:56,863
may lose respect for that power,

341
00:26:56,964 --> 00:27:00,127
but a weak man knows
the value of strength.

342
00:27:00,635 --> 00:27:02,500
And knows

343
00:27:03,037 --> 00:27:04,334
compassion.

344
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:10,272
Thanks. I think.

345
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:19,118
Whatever happens tomorrow,
you must promise me one thing.

346
00:27:22,323 --> 00:27:24,416
That you will stay who you are.

347
00:27:26,961 --> 00:27:28,929
Not a perfect soldier,

348
00:27:29,297 --> 00:27:30,286
but

349
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:32,766
a good man.

350
00:27:37,972 --> 00:27:39,439
To the little guys.

351
00:27:42,076 --> 00:27:43,509
No, no. Wait, wait. What I am doing?

352
00:27:43,611 --> 00:27:45,738
No, you have procedure tomorrow.
No fluids.

353
00:27:47,014 --> 00:27:48,845
All right. We'll drink it after.

354
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:52,517
No, I don't have procedure tomorrow.
Drink it after? I drink it now.

355
00:28:08,069 --> 00:28:10,902
Is there something in particular
you need?

356
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:19,576
I understand you found him.

357
00:28:20,415 --> 00:28:22,042
See for yourself.

358
00:28:34,195 --> 00:28:35,685
You disapprove.

359
00:28:36,397 --> 00:28:39,423
I just don't see
why you need concern yourself.

360
00:28:39,534 --> 00:28:41,263
I can't imagine he will succeed.

361
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:45,499
Again.

362
00:28:45,907 --> 00:28:49,900
His serum is the Allies' only defense
against this power we now possess.

363
00:28:50,011 --> 00:28:53,606
If we take it away from them,
then our victory is assured.

364
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,445
Shall I give the order?

365
00:28:59,554 --> 00:29:01,454
It has been given.

366
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:04,955
Good.

367
00:29:07,628 --> 00:29:08,595
Dr. Zola!

368
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,197
What do you think?

369
00:29:21,075 --> 00:29:22,975
A masterpiece.

370
00:29:33,321 --> 00:29:34,982
I know this neighborhood.

371
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,885
I got beat up in that alley.

372
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:40,551
And that parking lot.

373
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,764
And behind that diner.

374
00:29:45,266 --> 00:29:47,666
Did you have something against
running away?

375
00:29:50,404 --> 00:29:52,838
You start running,
they'll never let you stop.

376
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,999
You stand up, you push back.

377
00:29:55,109 --> 00:29:56,406
They can't say no forever, right?

378
00:29:57,211 --> 00:30:00,669
I know a little of what that's like,
to have every door shut in your face.

379
00:30:02,049 --> 00:30:03,949
I guess I just don't know
why you'd want to join the Army

380
00:30:04,051 --> 00:30:05,416
if you were a beautiful dame.

381
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,053
Or a... A woman.

382
00:30:07,255 --> 00:30:08,552
An agent. Not a dame.

383
00:30:08,956 --> 00:30:10,480
You are beautiful, but...

384
00:30:11,292 --> 00:30:13,487
You have no idea
how to talk to a woman, do you?

385
00:30:14,061 --> 00:30:16,029
I think this is the longest conversation
I've had with one.

386
00:30:17,498 --> 00:30:21,025
Women aren't exactly lining up
to dance with a guy they might step on.

387
00:30:21,435 --> 00:30:22,732
You must have danced.

388
00:30:22,837 --> 00:30:25,499
Well, asking a woman to dance
always seemed so terrifying.

389
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:28,565
And the past few years, it just

390
00:30:28,676 --> 00:30:31,543
didn't seem to matter that much.
I figured I'd wait.

391
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,107
For what?

392
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:36,148
The right partner.

393
00:30:50,698 --> 00:30:52,097
This way.

394
00:30:55,369 --> 00:30:57,735
- What are we doing here?
- Follow me.

395
00:31:11,118 --> 00:31:13,780
Wonderful weather this morning,
isn't it?

396
00:31:13,888 --> 00:31:16,118
Yes, but I always carry an umbrella.

397
00:32:13,781 --> 00:32:15,271
Good morning.

398
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:18,144
Please, not now.

399
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:24,116
Are you ready?

400
00:32:26,193 --> 00:32:29,754
Good. Take off your shirt, your tie,
and your hat.

401
00:32:35,469 --> 00:32:37,096
Senator Brandt, glad you could make it.

402
00:32:37,204 --> 00:32:38,796
Why exactly am I in Brooklyn?

403
00:32:38,906 --> 00:32:40,771
We needed access to
the city's power grid.

404
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:43,002
Of course, if you'd given me
the generators I requisitioned...

405
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:45,271
A lot of people are
asking for funds, Colonel.

406
00:32:45,379 --> 00:32:46,778
This is...

407
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:48,542
Fred Clemson, State Department.

408
00:32:48,649 --> 00:32:50,116
If this project of yours comes through,

409
00:32:50,217 --> 00:32:52,845
we'd like to see it used
for something other than headlines.

410
00:32:52,953 --> 00:32:56,684
Jesus. Somebody get that kid
a sandwich.

411
00:33:09,704 --> 00:33:10,762
Comfortable?

412
00:33:12,873 --> 00:33:13,999
It's a little big.

413
00:33:16,343 --> 00:33:17,901
You save me any of that schnapps?

414
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:21,780
Not as much as I should have. Sorry.

415
00:33:22,183 --> 00:33:23,480
Next time.

416
00:33:24,552 --> 00:33:26,679
Mr. Stark, how are your levels?

417
00:33:26,787 --> 00:33:29,017
- Levels at 100%.
- Good.

418
00:33:29,123 --> 00:33:31,091
We may dim half the lights in Brooklyn,

419
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:34,357
but we are ready as we'll ever be.

420
00:33:35,362 --> 00:33:36,386
Agent Carter?

421
00:33:36,497 --> 00:33:38,761
Don't you think you would be
more comfortable in the booth?

422
00:33:38,866 --> 00:33:40,458
- Yes, of course. Sorry.
- Good.

423
00:33:53,314 --> 00:33:54,679
<i>Do you hear me? Is this on?</i>

424
00:33:55,683 --> 00:33:56,775
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

425
00:33:57,518 --> 00:34:00,954
<i>today we take not another step
towards annihilation,</i>

426
00:34:01,388 --> 00:34:02,582
<i>but the first step</i>

427
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:04,982
<i>on the path to peace.</i>

428
00:34:07,328 --> 00:34:10,388
<i>We begin with a series
of microinjections into</i>

429
00:34:10,498 --> 00:34:14,264
<i>the subject's major muscle groups.
The serum infusion</i>

430
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:17,433
<i>will cause immediate cellular change.</i>

431
00:34:18,005 --> 00:34:20,974
<i>And then, to stimulate growth,</i>

432
00:34:21,175 --> 00:34:24,576
<i>the subject will be
saturated with Vita-Rays.</i>

433
00:34:32,319 --> 00:34:33,411
That wasn't so bad.

434
00:34:34,088 --> 00:34:35,385
That was penicillin.

435
00:34:39,026 --> 00:34:41,221
Serum infusion beginning in

436
00:34:41,629 --> 00:34:42,618
five,

437
00:34:43,697 --> 00:34:44,686
<i>four,</i>

438
00:34:46,133 --> 00:34:47,122
three,

439
00:34:48,569 --> 00:34:50,059
two,

440
00:34:51,505 --> 00:34:52,494
one.

441
00:35:03,083 --> 00:35:04,414
Now, Mr. Stark.

442
00:35:27,842 --> 00:35:30,811
Steven? Can you hear me?

443
00:35:31,245 --> 00:35:34,373
It's probably too late
to go to the bathroom, right?

444
00:35:35,816 --> 00:35:37,511
We will proceed.

445
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:51,053
That's 10%.

446
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,222
Twenty percent.

447
00:35:53,634 --> 00:35:54,760
Thirty.

448
00:35:57,404 --> 00:35:58,462
<i>That's 40%.</i>

449
00:35:59,974 --> 00:36:00,963
Vital signs are normal.

450
00:36:01,208 --> 00:36:02,197
That's 50%.

451
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:03,999
Sixty.

452
00:36:05,713 --> 00:36:06,975
Seventy.

453
00:36:11,585 --> 00:36:12,574
Steven!

454
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:15,120
- Steven!
- Shut it down!

455
00:36:16,457 --> 00:36:17,481
Shut it down!

456
00:36:18,192 --> 00:36:19,318
Kill the reactor, Mr. Stark!

457
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,118
Turn it off! Kill it! Kill the reactor!

458
00:36:21,228 --> 00:36:22,525
No!

459
00:36:22,963 --> 00:36:25,523
Don't! I can do this!

460
00:36:32,473 --> 00:36:33,497
Eighty.

461
00:36:34,208 --> 00:36:35,197
Ninety.

462
00:36:36,644 --> 00:36:38,578
That's 100%.

463
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,100
Mr. Stark?

464
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,880
Steven. Steven.

465
00:37:17,651 --> 00:37:18,948
The son of a bitch did it.

466
00:37:25,426 --> 00:37:26,757
- I did it.
- Yeah, yeah.

467
00:37:27,528 --> 00:37:28,586
I think we did it.

468
00:37:28,729 --> 00:37:29,889
You actually did it.

469
00:37:33,867 --> 00:37:35,459
How do you feel?

470
00:37:38,372 --> 00:37:39,896
Taller.

471
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:44,241
You look taller.

472
00:37:44,511 --> 00:37:46,138
How do you like Brooklyn now, Senator?

473
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:50,448
I can think of some folks in Berlin
who are about to get very nervous.

474
00:37:52,987 --> 00:37:55,114
Congratulations, Doctor.

475
00:37:55,222 --> 00:37:56,883
Thank you, sir.

476
00:38:08,135 --> 00:38:09,602
Stop him!

477
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:16,230
What are you doing?
Buddy, are you all right?

478
00:39:16,336 --> 00:39:17,963
Hey, this guy's been shot!

479
00:39:29,216 --> 00:39:30,205
I had him!

480
00:39:30,884 --> 00:39:32,511
Sorry!

481
00:39:52,372 --> 00:39:53,737
I'm sorry!

482
00:41:06,246 --> 00:41:08,874
No! No! Not my son!

483
00:41:09,816 --> 00:41:11,283
- Stop it!
- Don't hurt him!

484
00:41:13,287 --> 00:41:14,549
Get back!

485
00:41:15,689 --> 00:41:17,054
Let me go!

486
00:41:20,127 --> 00:41:21,492
Let go of my son!

487
00:41:24,198 --> 00:41:25,460
Don't hurt him!

488
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:31,531
Wait, don't! Don't!

489
00:41:33,307 --> 00:41:34,331
No! Don't!

490
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:42,382
Go get him! I can swim!

491
00:42:34,701 --> 00:42:36,896
- Who the hell are you?
- The first of many.

492
00:42:37,271 --> 00:42:39,000
Cut off one head,

493
00:42:41,008 --> 00:42:42,873
two more shall take its place.

494
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:47,177
Hail Hydra.

495
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,028
<i>The Führer is not accustomed
to being ignored, Herr Schmidt.</i>

496
00:43:09,136 --> 00:43:12,037
He funds your research because
you promised him weapons.

497
00:43:12,139 --> 00:43:14,039
You serve at his pleasure.

498
00:43:14,141 --> 00:43:17,008
He gave you this facility
as a reward for your injuries.

499
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:19,601
Reward? Call it what it is. Exile.

500
00:43:19,746 --> 00:43:22,374
I no longer reflect his image
of Aryan perfection.

501
00:43:22,482 --> 00:43:24,882
You think this is about appearances?

502
00:43:24,985 --> 00:43:29,388
Your Hydra division has failed to deliver
so much as a rifle in over a year.

503
00:43:29,489 --> 00:43:31,889
And we had learned
through local intelligence

504
00:43:31,992 --> 00:43:35,052
you had mounted a full-scale incursion
into Norway.

505
00:43:35,162 --> 00:43:37,062
<i>The Führer feels... How does he put it?</i>

506
00:43:37,164 --> 00:43:40,395
"The Red Skull has been indulged
long enough!"

507
00:43:52,446 --> 00:43:53,913
Gentlemen,

508
00:43:56,516 --> 00:43:59,974
you have come to see
the results of our work.

509
00:44:01,288 --> 00:44:02,585
Let me show you.

510
00:44:04,291 --> 00:44:06,919
Hitler speaks of a 1,000-year Reich,

511
00:44:07,027 --> 00:44:08,927
but he cannot feed his armies
for a month.

512
00:44:09,029 --> 00:44:12,362
His troops spill their blood
across every field in Europe,

513
00:44:12,466 --> 00:44:16,493
but still he is no closer to
achieving his goals.

514
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:20,133
And I suppose you still aim
to win this war through magic?

515
00:44:20,874 --> 00:44:24,674
Science. But I understand
your confusion.

516
00:44:25,145 --> 00:44:27,943
Great power has always
baffled primitive men.

517
00:44:28,215 --> 00:44:32,311
Hydra is assembling an arsenal
to destroy my enemies in one stroke,

518
00:44:32,552 --> 00:44:35,851
wherever they are, regardless of
how many forces they possess,

519
00:44:35,956 --> 00:44:37,048
all in a matter of hours.

520
00:44:37,391 --> 00:44:38,688
Your enemies?

521
00:44:38,792 --> 00:44:41,420
My weapons contain
enough destructive power

522
00:44:41,528 --> 00:44:44,156
to decimate
every hostile capital on Earth.

523
00:44:46,666 --> 00:44:48,293
Quite simply, gentlemen,

524
00:44:49,236 --> 00:44:51,727
I have harnessed the power of the gods.

525
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:54,832
Thank you, Schmidt.

526
00:44:54,941 --> 00:44:55,908
For what?

527
00:44:56,376 --> 00:44:59,607
For making it clear
how obviously mad you are.

528
00:44:59,713 --> 00:45:01,112
Berlin is on this map!

529
00:45:02,048 --> 00:45:03,572
So it is.

530
00:45:05,685 --> 00:45:08,279
You will be punished for your insolence!

531
00:45:08,388 --> 00:45:10,913
<i>You will be brought
before the Führer himself!</i>

532
00:45:20,133 --> 00:45:22,101
Schmidt...

533
00:45:27,073 --> 00:45:29,007
My apologies, Doctor,

534
00:45:29,109 --> 00:45:34,069
but we both knew Hydra could grow
no further in Hitler's shadow.

535
00:45:35,449 --> 00:45:36,473
Hail Hydra.

536
00:45:37,284 --> 00:45:38,979
Hail Hydra!

537
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:45,319
Hail Hydra!

538
00:45:56,970 --> 00:45:58,562
Think you got enough?

539
00:46:00,106 --> 00:46:04,236
Any hope of reproducing the program
is locked in your genetic code.

540
00:46:04,878 --> 00:46:07,506
But without Dr. Erskine,
it would take years.

541
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:10,544
He deserved more than this.

542
00:46:11,952 --> 00:46:15,410
If it could work only once,
he'd be proud it was you.

543
00:46:18,325 --> 00:46:21,226
Colonel Phillips,
my committee is demanding answers.

544
00:46:21,628 --> 00:46:23,152
Great. Why don't we start with how

545
00:46:23,263 --> 00:46:26,426
a German spy got a ride to
my secret installation in your car?

546
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:28,023
What have we got here?

547
00:46:28,134 --> 00:46:31,160
Speaking modestly, I'm the best
mechanical engineer in this country.

548
00:46:31,505 --> 00:46:34,167
But I don't know what's inside this thing
or how it works.

549
00:46:34,641 --> 00:46:36,108
We're not even close to this technology.

550
00:46:36,209 --> 00:46:37,836
- Then who is?
- Hydra.

551
00:46:38,478 --> 00:46:39,843
I'm sure you've been
reading our briefings.

552
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,371
I'm on a number of
committees, Colonel.

553
00:46:42,482 --> 00:46:44,677
Hydra is the Nazi deep-science division.

554
00:46:44,784 --> 00:46:48,379
It's led by Johann Schmidt.
But he has much bigger ambitions.

555
00:46:48,488 --> 00:46:49,682
Hydra is practically a cult.

556
00:46:49,789 --> 00:46:51,381
They worship Schmidt.
They think he's invincible.

557
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:53,052
So, what are you going to do about it?

558
00:46:54,127 --> 00:46:55,355
I spoke to the President this morning.

559
00:46:55,862 --> 00:46:58,888
- As of today, the SSR is being retasked.
- Colonel?

560
00:46:58,999 --> 00:47:02,298
We are taking the fight to Hydra.
Pack your bags, Agent Carter.

561
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:03,699
You, too, Stark.

562
00:47:04,104 --> 00:47:05,731
We're flying to London tonight.

563
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:08,137
Sir? If you're going after Schmidt,
I want in.

564
00:47:08,441 --> 00:47:10,409
You're an experiment.
You're going to Alamogordo.

565
00:47:11,011 --> 00:47:12,069
The serum worked.

566
00:47:12,178 --> 00:47:13,975
I asked for an army
and all I got was you.

567
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:17,175
You are not enough.

568
00:47:21,354 --> 00:47:22,651
With all due respect to the Colonel,

569
00:47:23,323 --> 00:47:25,120
I think we may be missing the point.

570
00:47:25,492 --> 00:47:29,792
I've seen you in action, Steve.
More importantly, the country's seen it.

571
00:47:30,163 --> 00:47:31,130
Paper.

572
00:47:32,098 --> 00:47:33,793
The enlistment lines
have been around the block

573
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:35,731
since your picture hit the newsstands.

574
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:39,697
You don't take a soldier,
a symbol like that,

575
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:41,735
and hide him in a lab.

576
00:47:42,309 --> 00:47:46,211
Son, do you want to serve your country

577
00:47:46,313 --> 00:47:49,282
on the most important battlefield
of the war?

578
00:47:50,584 --> 00:47:52,575
Sir, that's all I want.

579
00:47:53,186 --> 00:47:56,587
Then, congratulations.
You just got promoted.

580
00:47:59,726 --> 00:48:00,920
I don't know if I can do this.

581
00:48:01,027 --> 00:48:05,657
Nothing to it. You sell a few bonds.
Bonds buy bullets. Bullets kill Nazis.

582
00:48:06,066 --> 00:48:07,590
You're an American hero.

583
00:48:07,834 --> 00:48:09,995
It's just not how I pictured getting there.

584
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:12,696
The Senator has got
a lot of pull up on the Hill.

585
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:13,932
You play ball with us,

586
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,974
you'll be leading your own platoon
in no time.

587
00:48:16,076 --> 00:48:17,566
Take the shield.

588
00:48:18,912 --> 00:48:19,970
Go.

589
00:48:21,348 --> 00:48:25,978
<i>Who's strong and brave
Here to save the American way?</i>

590
00:48:27,253 --> 00:48:29,983
Not all of us can storm a beach
or drive a tank.

591
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:31,785
But there's still a way all of us can fight.

592
00:48:31,891 --> 00:48:36,555
<i>Who vows to fight like a man
For what's right, night and day?</i>

593
00:48:36,963 --> 00:48:38,555
Series E Defense Bonds.

594
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:42,362
Each one you buy is a bullet in
the barrel of your best guy's gun.

595
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:45,960
<i>Who will campaign door-to-door
for America?</i>

596
00:48:46,072 --> 00:48:49,337
<i>Carry the flag shore to shore
for America?</i>

597
00:48:49,442 --> 00:48:52,502
<i>From Hoboken to Spokane</i>

598
00:48:52,612 --> 00:48:58,608
<i>The star-spangled man with a plan</i>

599
00:49:00,987 --> 00:49:03,717
Cut. Guys, don't look at the camera.

600
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:07,850
<i>We can't ignore there's a threat
and a war we must win</i>

601
00:49:07,961 --> 00:49:10,759
Each one you buy is a bullet in
the barrel of your best guy's gun.

602
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:16,325
<i>Who'll hang a noose on the
goose-stepping goons from Berlin?</i>

603
00:49:17,804 --> 00:49:21,103
<i>Who will redeem
Heed the call for America?</i>

604
00:49:21,341 --> 00:49:24,401
<i>Who'll rise or fall
Give his all for America?</i>

605
00:49:24,978 --> 00:49:27,811
<i>Who's here to prove that we can?</i>

606
00:49:27,914 --> 00:49:33,978
<i>The star-spangled man with a plan</i>

607
00:49:34,454 --> 00:49:36,752
We all know this is about
trying to win the war.

608
00:49:36,856 --> 00:49:40,019
We can't do that without bullets
and bandages, tanks and tents.

609
00:49:40,126 --> 00:49:42,321
That's where you come in.
Every bond you buy

610
00:49:42,429 --> 00:49:43,657
will help protect someone you love.

611
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:46,630
- Turn around! He's right behind you!
- Keep our boys armed and ready,

612
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:49,463
and the Germans will think twice about
trying to get the drop on us.

<i>Stalwart and steady and true</i>

623
00:50:29,375 --> 00:50:30,342

<i>How many of you are ready to
help me sock old Adolf on the jaw?</i>

629
00:51:02,208 --> 00:51:03,334
<i>Okay.</i>

630
00:51:06,913 --> 00:51:08,312
<i>I need a volunteer.</i>

631
00:51:08,414 --> 00:51:10,609
I already volunteered!
How do you think I got here?

632
00:51:12,118 --> 00:51:14,143
Bring back the girls!

633
00:51:18,191 --> 00:51:20,489
<i>I think they only know the one song, but</i>

634
00:51:21,227 --> 00:51:22,694
<i>I'll see what I can do.</i>

635
00:51:23,029 --> 00:51:24,690
You do that, sweetheart.

636
00:51:25,198 --> 00:51:27,826
Nice boots, Tinker Bell!

637
00:51:28,902 --> 00:51:31,268
<i>Come on, guys,
we're all on the same team here.</i>

638
00:51:31,471 --> 00:51:33,632
Hey, Captain! Sign this!

639
00:51:44,484 --> 00:51:46,349
Bring back the girls!

640
00:51:50,990 --> 00:51:53,618
Don't worry, pal. They'll warm up to you.
Don't worry.

641
00:52:02,001 --> 00:52:03,366
Hello, Steve.

642
00:52:04,737 --> 00:52:05,863
Hi.

643
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:09,135
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

644
00:52:09,242 --> 00:52:11,437
Officially, I'm not here at all.

645
00:52:11,911 --> 00:52:13,811
That was quite a performance.

646
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:15,181
Yeah.

647
00:52:16,416 --> 00:52:18,043
I had to improvise a little bit.

648
00:52:18,418 --> 00:52:20,886
The crowds I'm used to
are usually more

649
00:52:22,488 --> 00:52:23,455
twelve.

650
00:52:23,556 --> 00:52:25,490
I understand you're
"America's New Hope."

651
00:52:25,592 --> 00:52:28,152
Bond sales take a 10% bump
in every state I visit.

652
00:52:28,261 --> 00:52:29,785
Is that Senator Brandt I hear?

653
00:52:31,431 --> 00:52:33,490
At least he's got me doing this.

654
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,124
Phillips would have had me
stuck in a lab.

655
00:52:35,435 --> 00:52:37,903
And these are your only two options?

656
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:40,569
A lab rat or a dancing monkey?

657
00:52:41,274 --> 00:52:43,902
You were meant for more than this,
you know.

658
00:52:49,782 --> 00:52:50,806
What?

659
00:52:52,185 --> 00:52:55,018
You know, for the longest time,
I dreamed about

660
00:52:55,622 --> 00:52:58,921
coming overseas
and being on the front lines,

661
00:52:59,292 --> 00:53:00,759
serving my country.

662
00:53:01,628 --> 00:53:03,596
I finally got everything I wanted

663
00:53:07,133 --> 00:53:08,157
and I'm wearing tights.

664
00:53:16,809 --> 00:53:18,276
They look like they've been through hell.

665
00:53:19,112 --> 00:53:20,306
These men more than most.

666
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:29,110
Schmidt sent out a force to Azzano.
Two hundred men went up against him,

667
00:53:29,989 --> 00:53:32,116
and less than 50 returned.

668
00:53:33,026 --> 00:53:35,426
Your audience contained
what was left of the 107th.

669
00:53:36,329 --> 00:53:38,194
The rest were killed or captured.

670
00:53:38,398 --> 00:53:39,990
The 107th?

671
00:53:40,099 --> 00:53:41,066
What?

672
00:53:41,534 --> 00:53:42,865
Come on.

673
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:44,937
Colonel Phillips.

674
00:53:45,038 --> 00:53:46,869
Well, if it isn't
the Star-Spangled Man With A Plan.

675
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:48,235
What's your plan today?

676
00:53:48,408 --> 00:53:49,568
I need the casualty list from Azzano.

677
00:53:49,676 --> 00:53:50,973
You don't get to give me orders, son.

678
00:53:51,077 --> 00:53:54,205
I just need one name,
Sergeant James Barnes from the 107th.

679
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:57,305
You and I are gonna have a
conversation later that you won't enjoy.

680
00:53:57,417 --> 00:54:00,511
- Please tell me if he's alive, sir. B-A-R...
- I can spell.

681
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:11,019
I have signed more of these condolence
letters today than I would care to count.

682
00:54:11,364 --> 00:54:13,423
But the name does sound familiar.

683
00:54:14,033 --> 00:54:15,057
I'm sorry.

684
00:54:19,272 --> 00:54:21,706
What about the others?
Are you planning a rescue mission?

685
00:54:22,041 --> 00:54:23,338
Yes, it's called "winning the war."

686
00:54:24,877 --> 00:54:26,367
But if you know where they are,
why not at least...

687
00:54:26,479 --> 00:54:28,208
They're 30 miles behind the lines

688
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:31,112
through some of the most
heavily fortified territory in Europe.

689
00:54:31,217 --> 00:54:32,684
We'd lose more men than we'd save.

690
00:54:32,785 --> 00:54:35,447
But I don't expect you to understand that
because you're a chorus girl.

691
00:54:37,724 --> 00:54:39,123
I think I understand just fine.

692
00:54:39,659 --> 00:54:41,286
Well, then understand it
somewhere else.

693
00:54:41,627 --> 00:54:45,825
If I read the posters correctly,
you got someplace to be in 30 minutes.

694
00:54:50,703 --> 00:54:53,331
Yes, sir. I do.

695
00:54:57,443 --> 00:55:02,437
If you have something to say, right now
is the perfect time to keep it to yourself.

696
00:55:05,685 --> 00:55:07,550
What do you plan to do, walk to Austria?

697
00:55:07,687 --> 00:55:09,052
If that's what it takes.

698
00:55:09,155 --> 00:55:11,248
You heard the Colonel.
Your friend is most likely dead.

699
00:55:11,357 --> 00:55:12,324
You don't know that.

700
00:55:12,425 --> 00:55:14,393
Even so, he's devising a strategy.
If he detects...

701
00:55:14,494 --> 00:55:17,292
By the time he's done that,
it could be too late.

702
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:18,421
Steve!

703
00:55:24,904 --> 00:55:29,000
You told me you thought I was meant
for more than this. Did you mean that?

704
00:55:30,710 --> 00:55:32,007
Every word.

705
00:55:33,746 --> 00:55:34,735
Then you got to let me go.

706
00:55:38,351 --> 00:55:40,148
I can do more than that.

707
00:55:40,553 --> 00:55:43,522
On stage, girls. Five minutes!

708
00:55:45,024 --> 00:55:46,286
Where's my helmet?

709
00:55:46,392 --> 00:55:47,791
Anyone seen Rogers?

710
00:55:51,731 --> 00:55:53,699
<i>The Hydra camp is in Krausberg,</i>

711
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,791
tucked between
these two mountain ranges.

712
00:55:55,902 --> 00:55:56,960
It's a factory of some kind.

713
00:55:57,070 --> 00:55:59,300
We should be able to
drop you right on the doorstep.

714
00:55:59,405 --> 00:56:01,100
Just get me as close as you can.

715
00:56:01,207 --> 00:56:02,868
You two are gonna be
in a lot of trouble when you land.

716
00:56:02,975 --> 00:56:03,942
And you won't?

717
00:56:04,043 --> 00:56:06,511
Where I'm going, if anybody yells at me,
I can just shoot them.

718
00:56:06,612 --> 00:56:08,239
They will undoubtedly shoot back.

719
00:56:08,347 --> 00:56:10,315
Well, let's hope it's good for something.

720
00:56:10,416 --> 00:56:11,440
Agent Carter?

721
00:56:11,551 --> 00:56:12,848
If we're not in too much of a hurry,

722
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:16,479
I thought we could stop off in Lucerne
for a late-night fondue.

723
00:56:21,761 --> 00:56:24,559
Stark is the best civilian pilot
I've ever seen.

724
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:27,299
He's mad enough to brave this airspace.
We're lucky to have him.

725
00:56:29,068 --> 00:56:30,831
So, are you two... Do you...

726
00:56:33,272 --> 00:56:34,398
...fondue?

727
00:56:35,608 --> 00:56:37,769
This is your transponder.
Activate it when you're ready

728
00:56:37,910 --> 00:56:40,310
and the signal will lead us
straight to you.

729
00:56:41,414 --> 00:56:43,279
Are you sure this thing works?

730
00:56:43,382 --> 00:56:45,646
It's been tested more than you, pal.

731
00:56:50,790 --> 00:56:53,315
Get back here!
We're taking you all the way in!

732
00:56:55,128 --> 00:56:58,097
As soon as I'm clear, you turn this thing
around and get the hell out of here!

733
00:56:58,364 --> 00:57:00,332
You can't give me orders!

734
00:57:00,633 --> 00:57:03,261
The hell I can't! I'm a Captain!

735
00:57:21,487 --> 00:57:25,924
<i>As you can see, production of
the Valkyrie is progressing on schedule,</i>

736
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:28,323
even with components of this size.

737
00:57:28,661 --> 00:57:31,357
Increase the output by 60%

738
00:57:31,664 --> 00:57:35,293
and see to it our other facilities
do the same.

739
00:57:35,835 --> 00:57:40,135
But these prisoners,
I'm not sure they have the strength.

740
00:57:40,506 --> 00:57:43,475
Then use up what strength
they have left, Doctor.

741
00:57:44,010 --> 00:57:46,808
There are always more workers.

742
00:57:48,848 --> 00:57:49,974
Not now!

743
00:58:05,364 --> 00:58:07,161
You know, Fritz,

744
00:58:08,201 --> 00:58:10,499
one of these days,
I'm gonna have a stick of my own.

745
00:58:43,636 --> 00:58:44,762
Fellas.

746
01:00:46,359 --> 01:00:47,656
Who are you supposed to be?

747
01:00:48,027 --> 01:00:51,292
I'm Captain America.

748
01:00:52,565 --> 01:00:53,998
I beg your pardon?

749
01:00:57,436 --> 01:00:59,233
What, are we taking everybody?

750
01:00:59,605 --> 01:01:01,163
I'm from Fresno, Ace.

751
01:01:01,374 --> 01:01:04,104
Is there anybody else? I'm looking
for a Sergeant James Barnes.

752
01:01:04,443 --> 01:01:07,412
There's an isolation ward in the factory,
but no one's ever come back from it.

753
01:01:07,513 --> 01:01:08,605
All right.

754
01:01:08,714 --> 01:01:10,739
The tree line is northwest,
80 yards past the gate.

755
01:01:10,850 --> 01:01:13,045
Get out fast and give 'em hell.

756
01:01:13,152 --> 01:01:14,847
I'll meet you guys in the clearing
with anybody else I find.

757
01:01:14,954 --> 01:01:17,479
Wait. You know what you're doing?

758
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:20,423
Yeah. I've knocked out Adolf Hitler
over 200 times.

759
01:01:45,451 --> 01:01:47,180
You know how to use that thing?

760
01:01:51,190 --> 01:01:52,157
Okay.

761
01:01:54,493 --> 01:01:55,960
What is happening?

762
01:02:04,270 --> 01:02:06,238
Hey. Not exactly a Buick.

763
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:09,674
<i>- That one. "Zündung."
- Zündung?</i>

764
01:02:10,609 --> 01:02:11,576
Get this thing going, Dugan!

765
01:02:11,677 --> 01:02:13,008
I didn't know you spoke German.

766
01:02:13,112 --> 01:02:16,309
Three semesters at Howard,
switched to French, girls much cuter.

767
01:02:16,415 --> 01:02:17,382
Didn't ask for the resume.

768
01:02:30,162 --> 01:02:31,527
- On your left!
- Up top!

769
01:02:49,148 --> 01:02:51,446
No, no! What are you doing?

770
01:02:52,551 --> 01:02:55,520
Our forces are outmatched.

771
01:03:20,179 --> 01:03:22,875
Keep moving! Grab those grenades!

772
01:04:02,488 --> 01:04:05,480
Sergeant. Three-two-five-five-seven.

773
01:04:06,592 --> 01:04:07,559
Bucky?

774
01:04:08,694 --> 01:04:09,661
Oh, my God.

775
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:16,267
- Is that...
- It's me.

776
01:04:16,502 --> 01:04:18,333
- It's Steve.
- Steve?

777
01:04:18,437 --> 01:04:19,870
- Come on.
- Steve.

778
01:04:24,043 --> 01:04:25,169
I thought you were dead.

779
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:27,476
I thought you were smaller.

780
01:04:35,387 --> 01:04:36,445
Come on.

781
01:04:38,891 --> 01:04:41,689
- What happened to you?
- I joined the Army.

782
01:04:48,067 --> 01:04:50,126
- Did it hurt?
- A little.

783
01:04:50,569 --> 01:04:51,866
Is this permanent?

784
01:04:52,071 --> 01:04:53,129
So far.

785
01:05:23,168 --> 01:05:24,795
Captain America!

786
01:05:25,023 --> 01:05:26,650
How exciting!

787
01:05:27,192 --> 01:05:30,161
I am a great fan of your films!

788
01:05:31,863 --> 01:05:35,822
So, Dr. Erskine managed it after all.

789
01:05:36,201 --> 01:05:37,998
Not exactly an improvement,

790
01:05:38,103 --> 01:05:41,402
but still, impressive.

791
01:05:44,209 --> 01:05:45,676
You've got no idea.

792
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:49,838
Haven't I?

793
01:06:05,530 --> 01:06:08,522
No matter what lies Erskine told you,

794
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:11,997
you see, I was his greatest success!

795
01:06:25,484 --> 01:06:27,281
You don't have one of those, do you?

796
01:06:27,586 --> 01:06:29,884
You are deluded, Captain.

797
01:06:30,589 --> 01:06:33,217
You pretend to be a simple soldier,

798
01:06:33,325 --> 01:06:35,725
but in reality, you are just afraid

799
01:06:35,827 --> 01:06:39,456
to admit that
we have left humanity behind.

800
01:06:41,266 --> 01:06:43,962
Unlike you, I embrace it proudly.

801
01:06:45,170 --> 01:06:46,228
Without fear!

802
01:06:46,505 --> 01:06:47,802
Then how come you're running?

803
01:06:59,918 --> 01:07:01,943
Come on, let's go. Up.

804
01:07:04,923 --> 01:07:07,255
Sir? Are we going to the roof?

805
01:07:10,796 --> 01:07:12,093
What about me?

806
01:07:12,330 --> 01:07:14,127
Where will I sit?

807
01:07:14,766 --> 01:07:16,461
Not a scratch, Doctor.

808
01:07:16,635 --> 01:07:18,102
Not a scratch.

809
01:07:51,169 --> 01:07:53,330
Let's go. One at a time.

810
01:08:22,033 --> 01:08:25,002
- Gotta be a rope or something!
- Just go! Get out of here!

811
01:08:25,103 --> 01:08:26,468
No! Not without you!

812
01:08:27,405 --> 01:08:28,702
Hell.

813
01:08:49,895 --> 01:08:53,228
Senator Brandt, I regret to report that

814
01:08:53,331 --> 01:08:58,132
Captain Steven G. Rogers went missing
behind enemy lines on the third.

815
01:08:58,236 --> 01:09:00,363
Aerial reconnaissance
has proven unfruitful.

816
01:09:00,472 --> 01:09:04,431
As a result,
I must declare Captain Rogers

817
01:09:05,310 --> 01:09:07,437
killed in action. Period.

818
01:09:11,483 --> 01:09:13,212
The last surveillance flight is back.

819
01:09:15,654 --> 01:09:17,622
No sign of activity.

820
01:09:18,423 --> 01:09:21,187
- Go get a cup of coffee, Corporal.
- Yes, sir.

821
01:09:23,829 --> 01:09:24,955
I can't touch Stark.

822
01:09:25,096 --> 01:09:27,894
He's rich and he's the Army's
number one weapons contractor.

823
01:09:27,999 --> 01:09:29,489
You are neither one.

824
01:09:29,601 --> 01:09:32,069
With respect, sir,
I don't regret my actions.

825
01:09:32,170 --> 01:09:33,831
And I don't think
Captain Rogers did, either.

826
01:09:33,939 --> 01:09:36,737
What makes you think
I give a damn about your opinions?

827
01:09:36,842 --> 01:09:38,639
I took a chance with you, Agent Carter.

828
01:09:38,743 --> 01:09:42,304
And now America's golden boy
and a lot of other good men are dead

829
01:09:42,414 --> 01:09:43,381
'cause you had a crush.

830
01:09:43,481 --> 01:09:45,813
It wasn't that. I had faith.

831
01:09:46,351 --> 01:09:50,913
Well, I hope that's a big comfort to you
when they shut this division down.

832
01:09:53,458 --> 01:09:54,755
What the hell's going on out there?

833
01:10:37,702 --> 01:10:39,465
Look who it is!

834
01:11:06,631 --> 01:11:08,758
Some of these men
need medical attention.

835
01:11:08,867 --> 01:11:10,767
- Medic, we got wounded.
- Right over here.

836
01:11:10,869 --> 01:11:13,429
I'd like to surrender myself
for disciplinary action.

837
01:11:14,873 --> 01:11:16,500
That won't be necessary.

838
01:11:20,378 --> 01:11:21,606
Yes, sir.

839
01:11:23,181 --> 01:11:24,648
Faith, huh?

840
01:11:31,389 --> 01:11:32,651
You're late.

841
01:11:36,528 --> 01:11:38,189
Couldn't call my ride.

842
01:11:40,498 --> 01:11:41,931
Hey!

843
01:11:42,233 --> 01:11:43,860
Let's hear it for Captain America!

844
01:12:00,885 --> 01:12:04,184
<i>I am honored
to present this medal for valor</i>

845
01:12:04,322 --> 01:12:07,917
to my personal friend, Captain America!

846
01:12:10,562 --> 01:12:12,189
Captain America!

847
01:12:13,798 --> 01:12:15,766
Captain, that's your cue!

848
01:12:19,571 --> 01:12:21,596
I thought he'd be taller.

849
01:12:33,618 --> 01:12:36,678
The fifth one was here in Poland,
right near the Baltic.

850
01:12:36,788 --> 01:12:38,915
And the sixth one was

851
01:12:39,457 --> 01:12:44,417
about here, 30, 40 miles west
of the Maginot Line.

852
01:12:46,231 --> 01:12:48,096
I just got a quick look.

853
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,768
Well, nobody's perfect.

854
01:12:54,072 --> 01:12:56,438
These are the weapon factories
we know about.

855
01:12:56,908 --> 01:12:58,739
Sergeant Barnes said
that Hydra shipped

856
01:12:58,843 --> 01:13:01,368
all the parts to another facility
that isn't on this map.

857
01:13:01,479 --> 01:13:03,106
Agent Carter, coordinate with Ml6.

858
01:13:03,214 --> 01:13:05,876
I want every Allied eyeball
looking for that main Hydra base.

859
01:13:05,984 --> 01:13:07,008
What about us?

860
01:13:07,118 --> 01:13:09,882
We are going to set a fire
under Johann Schmidt's ass.

861
01:13:09,988 --> 01:13:11,956
What do you say, Rogers? It's your map.

862
01:13:12,057 --> 01:13:15,652
- You think you can wipe Hydra off it?
- Yes, sir. I'll need a team.

863
01:13:16,094 --> 01:13:18,119
We're already putting together
the best men.

864
01:13:18,496 --> 01:13:21,294
With all due respect, sir, so am I.

865
01:13:22,667 --> 01:13:24,032
So, let's get this straight.

866
01:13:24,135 --> 01:13:26,126
We barely got out of there alive,
and you want us to go back?

867
01:13:27,872 --> 01:13:29,100
Pretty much.

868
01:13:29,207 --> 01:13:31,505
Sounds rather fun, actually.

869
01:13:33,211 --> 01:13:34,178
I'm in.

870
01:13:46,858 --> 01:13:48,155
We're in.

871
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:52,357
Hell, I'll always fight.
But you got to do one thing for me.

872
01:13:52,464 --> 01:13:53,453
What's that?

873
01:13:55,633 --> 01:13:56,657
Open a tab.

874
01:14:00,538 --> 01:14:02,005
Well, that was easy.

875
01:14:02,373 --> 01:14:04,807
- Another round.
- Where are they putting all this stuff?

876
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:11,007
See? I told you.

877
01:14:11,649 --> 01:14:13,617
They're all idiots.

878
01:14:14,219 --> 01:14:15,516
How about you?

879
01:14:16,321 --> 01:14:19,347
You ready to follow Captain America
into the jaws of death?

880
01:14:19,657 --> 01:14:20,783
Hell, no.

881
01:14:20,892 --> 01:14:25,352
That little guy from Brooklyn who was
too dumb not to run away from a fight.

882
01:14:26,564 --> 01:14:28,191
I'm following him.

883
01:14:31,736 --> 01:14:33,101
But you're keeping the outfit, right?

884
01:14:36,074 --> 01:14:37,200
You know what?

885
01:14:38,376 --> 01:14:39,502
It's kind of growing on me.

886
01:14:50,989 --> 01:14:52,388
- Captain.
- Agent Carter.

887
01:14:55,126 --> 01:14:56,093
Ma'am.

888
01:14:56,194 --> 01:14:59,163
Howard has some equipment for you
to try. Tomorrow morning?

889
01:14:59,264 --> 01:15:00,561
Sounds good.

890
01:15:05,270 --> 01:15:07,966
I see your top squad
is prepping for duty.

891
01:15:08,439 --> 01:15:09,406
You don't like music?

892
01:15:09,507 --> 01:15:10,872
I do, actually.

893
01:15:12,677 --> 01:15:16,135
I might even,
when this is all over, go dancing.

894
01:15:16,514 --> 01:15:17,811
Then what are we waiting for?

895
01:15:18,783 --> 01:15:20,307
The right partner.

896
01:15:21,452 --> 01:15:22,749
0800, Captain.

897
01:15:23,955 --> 01:15:26,253
Yes, ma'am. I'll be there.

898
01:15:26,624 --> 01:15:28,148
I'm invisible.

899
01:15:28,693 --> 01:15:31,753
I'm turning into you.
It's like a horrible dream.

900
01:15:32,363 --> 01:15:35,423
Don't take it so hard.
Maybe she's got a friend.

901
01:15:37,135 --> 01:15:39,763
Emission signature is unusual.

902
01:15:40,305 --> 01:15:42,273
Alpha and beta ray neutral.

903
01:15:43,708 --> 01:15:46,108
Though I doubt
Rogers picked up on that.

904
01:15:47,812 --> 01:15:49,109
Seems harmless enough.

905
01:15:50,481 --> 01:15:52,346
Hard to see what all the fuss is about.

906
01:16:01,893 --> 01:16:03,190
Write that down.

907
01:16:05,163 --> 01:16:07,859
Excuse me. I'm looking for Mr. Stark.

908
01:16:07,966 --> 01:16:10,025
He's in with Colonel Phillips.

909
01:16:14,839 --> 01:16:17,637
Of course, you're welcome to wait.

910
01:16:25,049 --> 01:16:26,380
I read about what you did.

911
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:28,378
Oh, the... Yeah.

912
01:16:29,187 --> 01:16:30,711
Well, that's, you know.

913
01:16:32,357 --> 01:16:33,756
Just doing what needed to be done.

914
01:16:34,092 --> 01:16:36,925
Sounded like more than that.
You saved nearly 400 men.

915
01:16:43,268 --> 01:16:45,236
Really, it's not a big deal.

916
01:16:46,137 --> 01:16:48,264
Tell that to their wives.

917
01:16:51,643 --> 01:16:53,235
I don't think they were all married.

918
01:16:53,444 --> 01:16:55,002
You're a hero.

919
01:16:55,113 --> 01:16:57,604
Well, that depends
on the definition, really.

920
01:16:57,715 --> 01:17:01,014
The women of America,
they owe you their thanks.

921
01:17:02,220 --> 01:17:05,155
And seeing as they're not here...

922
01:17:13,831 --> 01:17:14,820
Captain!

923
01:17:14,932 --> 01:17:17,560
We're ready for you,
if you're not otherwise occupied.

924
01:17:18,703 --> 01:17:20,170
Agent Carter, wait.

925
01:17:20,471 --> 01:17:22,598
Looks like finding a partner
wasn't that hard after all.

926
01:17:22,707 --> 01:17:24,299
Peggy, that's not
what you thought it was.

927
01:17:24,409 --> 01:17:27,003
I don't think anything, Captain,
not one thing.

928
01:17:27,312 --> 01:17:30,941
You always wanted to be a soldier,
and now you are, just like all the rest.

929
01:17:31,215 --> 01:17:32,307
Well, what about you and Stark?

930
01:17:32,417 --> 01:17:34,885
How do I know you two
haven't been fondue-ing?

931
01:17:39,824 --> 01:17:42,122
You still don't know
a bloody thing about women.

932
01:17:43,728 --> 01:17:45,719
<i>Fondue is just cheese and bread,
my friend.</i>

933
01:17:45,830 --> 01:17:48,628
- Really? I didn't think...
- Nor should you, pal.

934
01:17:48,733 --> 01:17:50,724
The moment you think you know
what's going on in a woman's head

935
01:17:50,835 --> 01:17:53,201
is the moment your goose
is well and truly cooked.

936
01:17:53,304 --> 01:17:55,966
Me, I concentrate on work,
which at the moment

937
01:17:56,074 --> 01:17:58,907
is about making sure you and your men
do not get killed.

938
01:17:59,177 --> 01:18:00,872
Carbon polymer.

939
01:18:01,546 --> 01:18:03,912
Should withstand
your average German bayonet.

940
01:18:04,015 --> 01:18:07,473
Although Hydra's not going to
attack you with a pocket knife.

941
01:18:07,852 --> 01:18:10,582
I hear you're kind of attached.

942
01:18:10,688 --> 01:18:12,087
It's handier than you might think.

943
01:18:12,190 --> 01:18:14,317
I took the liberty
of coming up with some options.

944
01:18:15,026 --> 01:18:16,050
This one's fun.

945
01:18:16,894 --> 01:18:19,419
She's been fitted with electrical relays
that allow you to...

946
01:18:19,530 --> 01:18:21,088
- What about this one?
- No, no, that's just a prototype.

947
01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:23,326
- What's it made of?
- Vibranium.

948
01:18:24,435 --> 01:18:27,063
It's stronger than steel
and a third the weight.

949
01:18:27,705 --> 01:18:30,503
It's completely vibration absorbent.

950
01:18:32,510 --> 01:18:34,068
How come it's not standard issue?

951
01:18:34,178 --> 01:18:35,509
That's the rarest metal on Earth.

952
01:18:35,613 --> 01:18:37,274
What you're holding there,
that's all we've got.

953
01:18:37,382 --> 01:18:39,577
You quite finished, Mr. Stark?

954
01:18:39,684 --> 01:18:41,515
I'm sure the Captain
has some unfinished business.

955
01:18:41,619 --> 01:18:43,519
What do you think?

956
01:18:53,398 --> 01:18:55,366
Yes, I think it works.

957
01:19:04,675 --> 01:19:06,802
I had some ideas about the uniform.

958
01:19:07,078 --> 01:19:08,568
Whatever you want, pal.

959
01:21:13,271 --> 01:21:15,603
You are failing!

960
01:21:16,507 --> 01:21:19,772
We are close to an offensive
that will shake the planet,

961
01:21:19,877 --> 01:21:21,811
yet we are continually delayed

962
01:21:21,913 --> 01:21:24,575
because you cannot outwit
a simpleton with a shield!

963
01:21:24,682 --> 01:21:26,650
This is hardly my area of expertise.

964
01:21:26,751 --> 01:21:30,448
I merely developed the weapons.
I cannot fire them.

965
01:21:31,756 --> 01:21:35,021
Finish your mission, Doctor,
before the American finishes his.

966
01:21:35,793 --> 01:21:36,782
Sir!

967
01:21:39,096 --> 01:21:40,120
<i>I'm sorry, Herr Schmidt.</i>

968
01:21:41,699 --> 01:21:43,496
We fought to the last man.

969
01:21:46,804 --> 01:21:48,772
Evidently not.

970
01:22:00,985 --> 01:22:04,182
Remember when I made you ride
the Cyclone at Coney Island?

971
01:22:04,288 --> 01:22:05,915
Yeah, and I threw up?

972
01:22:07,258 --> 01:22:08,725
This isn't payback, is it?

973
01:22:08,826 --> 01:22:10,555
Now why would I do that?

974
01:22:10,661 --> 01:22:13,391
We were right. Dr. Zola's on the train.

975
01:22:13,497 --> 01:22:17,024
Hydra dispatcher gave him permission
to open up the throttle.

976
01:22:17,134 --> 01:22:19,034
Wherever he's going,
they must need him bad.

977
01:22:26,143 --> 01:22:28,509
Let's get going,
because they're moving like the devil.

978
01:22:29,146 --> 01:22:30,841
We only got about a 10-second window.

979
01:22:30,948 --> 01:22:33,508
You miss that window,
we're bugs on a windshield.

980
01:22:34,151 --> 01:22:35,118
Mind the gap.

981
01:22:35,219 --> 01:22:37,084
Better get moving, bugs!

982
01:23:44,922 --> 01:23:47,015
Stop him! Fire again!

983
01:24:39,643 --> 01:24:42,203
- I had him on the ropes.
- I know you did.

984
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:43,904
Get down!

985
01:24:46,150 --> 01:24:47,481
Fire again!

986
01:24:48,252 --> 01:24:49,776
<i>Kill him! Now!</i>

987
01:24:57,061 --> 01:24:58,028
Bucky!

988
01:25:02,133 --> 01:25:03,566
Hang on!

989
01:25:05,302 --> 01:25:06,269
Grab my hand!

990
01:26:11,869 --> 01:26:13,166
Sit down.

991
01:26:19,643 --> 01:26:21,941
- What is this?
- Steak.

992
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:24,006
What is in it?

993
01:26:25,149 --> 01:26:26,446
Cow.

994
01:26:29,553 --> 01:26:32,545
Doctor, do you realize how difficult it is

995
01:26:32,656 --> 01:26:35,454
to get ahold of a prime cut like that
out here?

996
01:26:36,894 --> 01:26:38,293
I don't eat meat.

997
01:26:39,230 --> 01:26:40,356
Why not?

998
01:26:40,464 --> 01:26:42,125
It disagrees with me.

999
01:26:42,233 --> 01:26:45,134
How about cyanide? Does that give you
the rumbly tummy, too?

1000
01:26:48,072 --> 01:26:51,235
Every Hydra agent that
we've tried to take alive

1001
01:26:51,342 --> 01:26:56,143
has crunched a little pill before
we can stop him. But not you.

1002
01:26:57,181 --> 01:26:59,979
So, here is my brilliant theory.

1003
01:27:02,253 --> 01:27:03,550
You want to live.

1004
01:27:04,922 --> 01:27:07,049
You're trying to intimidate me, Colonel.

1005
01:27:07,691 --> 01:27:09,283
I bought you dinner.

1006
01:27:14,531 --> 01:27:17,591
"Given the valuable information
he has provided

1007
01:27:18,369 --> 01:27:21,930
"and in exchange for
his full cooperation,

1008
01:27:22,373 --> 01:27:25,240
"Dr. Zola is being remanded
to Switzerland"?

1009
01:27:25,342 --> 01:27:29,301
I sent that message to Washington
this morning, of course it was encoded.

1010
01:27:30,014 --> 01:27:33,609
You guys haven't broken those codes,
have you? That would be awkward.

1011
01:27:33,717 --> 01:27:35,685
Schmidt will know this is a lie.

1012
01:27:35,786 --> 01:27:39,347
He's going to kill you anyway, Doc.
You're a liability.

1013
01:27:39,790 --> 01:27:41,758
You know more about Schmidt
than anyone.

1014
01:27:42,126 --> 01:27:47,257
And the last guy you cost us
was Captain Rogers' closest friend,

1015
01:27:47,364 --> 01:27:50,299
so I wouldn't count on
the very best of protection.

1016
01:27:51,068 --> 01:27:53,696
It's you or Schmidt.

1017
01:27:54,305 --> 01:27:56,364
It's just the hand you've been dealt.

1018
01:27:58,976 --> 01:28:02,070
Schmidt believes he walks
in the footsteps of the gods.

1019
01:28:03,814 --> 01:28:06,612
Only the world itself will satisfy him.

1020
01:28:06,717 --> 01:28:08,912
You do realize that's nuts, don't you?

1021
01:28:09,019 --> 01:28:09,986
What?

1022
01:28:11,021 --> 01:28:13,216
The sanity of the plan
is of no consequence.

1023
01:28:13,324 --> 01:28:15,451
- And why is that?
- Because he can do it!

1024
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:17,457
What's his target?

1025
01:28:18,762 --> 01:28:21,094
His target

1026
01:28:22,666 --> 01:28:23,724
is everywhere.

1027
01:28:44,555 --> 01:28:46,182
Tomorrow,

1028
01:28:46,957 --> 01:28:50,256
Hydra will stand master of the world,

1029
01:28:51,028 --> 01:28:53,496
<i>borne to victory on the wings
of the Valkyrie.</i>

1030
01:28:54,665 --> 01:28:58,567
Our enemies' weapons
will be powerless against us.

1031
01:28:59,203 --> 01:29:04,163
If they shoot down one plane,
hundreds more will rain fire upon them!

1032
01:29:08,679 --> 01:29:11,045
If they cut off one head,

1033
01:29:11,582 --> 01:29:14,346
two more shall take its place.

1034
01:29:14,718 --> 01:29:16,015
Hail Hydra.

1035
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:17,287
- Hail Hydra!
- Hail Hydra!

1036
01:29:17,988 --> 01:29:20,616
- Hail Hydra! Hail Hydra!
- Hail Hydra! Hail Hydra!

1037
01:29:32,603 --> 01:29:35,401
<i>Blackout is still in effect
throughout the London area.</i>

1038
01:29:35,773 --> 01:29:37,741
<i>Please wait for the all-clear.</i>

1039
01:29:38,108 --> 01:29:43,068
<i>Your attention, please. All citizens shall
remain indoors until further notice.</i>

1040
01:29:43,781 --> 01:29:46,841
<i>Blackout is still in effect
throughout the London area.</i>

1041
01:29:54,858 --> 01:29:56,826
Dr. Erskine said that

1042
01:29:57,194 --> 01:29:59,662
the serum wouldn't
just affect my muscles,

1043
01:29:59,763 --> 01:30:01,822
it would affect my cells.

1044
01:30:02,866 --> 01:30:06,666
Create a protective system
of regeneration and healing.

1045
01:30:06,770 --> 01:30:08,397
Which means

1046
01:30:10,707 --> 01:30:12,334
I can't get drunk.

1047
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:15,441
Did you know that?

1048
01:30:15,879 --> 01:30:20,111
Your metabolism burns four times faster
than the average person.

1049
01:30:21,852 --> 01:30:24,480
He thought it could be
one of the side effects.

1050
01:30:29,493 --> 01:30:31,461
It wasn't your fault.

1051
01:30:32,629 --> 01:30:34,256
- Did you read the report?
- Yes.

1052
01:30:35,466 --> 01:30:36,763
Then you know that's not true.

1053
01:30:36,867 --> 01:30:38,596
You did everything you could.

1054
01:30:42,005 --> 01:30:44,132
Did you believe in your friend?

1055
01:30:44,241 --> 01:30:45,708
Did you respect him?

1056
01:30:47,344 --> 01:30:49,244
Then stop blaming yourself.

1057
01:30:49,613 --> 01:30:51,945
Allow Barnes the dignity of his choice.

1058
01:30:52,349 --> 01:30:53,839
He damn well must have thought
you were worth it.

1059
01:30:56,453 --> 01:30:57,977
I'm going after Schmidt.

1060
01:30:59,623 --> 01:31:02,922
I'm not gonna stop until all of Hydra
is dead or captured.

1061
01:31:04,862 --> 01:31:06,489
You won't be alone.

1062
01:31:09,133 --> 01:31:12,296
Johann Schmidt belongs in a bughouse.
He thinks he's a god,

1063
01:31:12,402 --> 01:31:14,336
and he's willing to blow up
half the world to prove it,

1064
01:31:14,438 --> 01:31:15,996
starting with the USA.

1065
01:31:16,106 --> 01:31:19,200
Schmidt's working with powers
beyond our capabilities.

1066
01:31:19,309 --> 01:31:21,038
He gets across the Atlantic,

1067
01:31:21,145 --> 01:31:23,545
he will wipe out
the entire Eastern Seaboard in an hour.

1068
01:31:28,018 --> 01:31:29,610
How much time we got?

1069
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:31,984
According to my new best friend,
under 24 hours.

1070
01:31:32,089 --> 01:31:35,058
- Where is he now?
- Hydra's last base is here.

1071
01:31:35,926 --> 01:31:39,327
In the Alps, 500 feet below the surface.

1072
01:31:41,365 --> 01:31:42,764
So what are we supposed to do?

1073
01:31:42,866 --> 01:31:45,426
I mean, it's not like
we can just knock on the front door.

1074
01:31:46,103 --> 01:31:47,400
Why not?

1075
01:31:52,509 --> 01:31:54,670
That's exactly what we're going to do.

1076
01:34:00,304 --> 01:34:04,400
Arrogance may not be
a uniquely American trait,

1077
01:34:04,508 --> 01:34:06,601
but I must say,
you do it better than anyone.

1078
01:34:09,546 --> 01:34:12,174
But there are limits

1079
01:34:12,549 --> 01:34:14,813
to what even you can do, Captain.

1080
01:34:15,319 --> 01:34:18,550
Or did Erskine tell you otherwise?

1081
01:34:18,655 --> 01:34:20,088
He told me you were insane.

1082
01:34:24,828 --> 01:34:26,796
He resented my genius

1083
01:34:26,897 --> 01:34:30,458
and tried to deny me
what was rightfully mine.

1084
01:34:30,567 --> 01:34:32,125
But he gave you everything.

1085
01:34:34,571 --> 01:34:35,799
So,

1086
01:34:37,607 --> 01:34:40,167
what made you so special?

1087
01:34:43,380 --> 01:34:44,506
Nothing.

1088
01:34:45,716 --> 01:34:47,240
I'm just a kid from Brooklyn.

1089
01:34:58,795 --> 01:35:00,353
I can do this all day.

1090
01:35:00,464 --> 01:35:02,455
Of course you can, of course.

1091
01:35:02,566 --> 01:35:05,865
But, unfortunately,
I am on a tight schedule.

1092
01:35:11,575 --> 01:35:12,940
So am I.

1093
01:35:25,422 --> 01:35:28,050
Rogers! You might need this!

1094
01:35:28,525 --> 01:35:29,492
Thanks!

1095
01:35:40,737 --> 01:35:43,228
We're in! Assault team, go!

1096
01:35:43,473 --> 01:35:44,770
Move out!

1097
01:35:45,709 --> 01:35:47,438
Move!

1098
01:35:53,350 --> 01:35:55,375
Keep your spacing!

1099
01:36:34,991 --> 01:36:37,152
Cut off one head, two more shall...

1100
01:36:38,695 --> 01:36:40,356
Let's go find two more!

1101
01:37:07,090 --> 01:37:08,057
You're late.

1102
01:37:11,094 --> 01:37:13,062
- Weren't you about to...
- Right.

1103
01:38:27,737 --> 01:38:28,726
Get in!

1104
01:38:57,434 --> 01:38:58,731
- Keep it steady!
- Wait!

1105
01:39:04,307 --> 01:39:05,501
Go get him.

1106
01:39:07,477 --> 01:39:09,138
I'm not kissing you!

1107
01:42:48,631 --> 01:42:51,759
- You don't give up, do you?
- Nope!

1108
01:44:00,637 --> 01:44:03,197
You could have the power of the gods!

1109
01:44:03,907 --> 01:44:08,537
Yet you wear a flag on your chest
and think you fight a battle of nations!

1110
01:44:09,445 --> 01:44:11,572
I have seen the future, Captain!

1111
01:44:12,548 --> 01:44:15,574
- There are no flags!
- Not my future!

1112
01:44:29,465 --> 01:44:30,489
What have you done?

1113
01:44:31,467 --> 01:44:32,434
No!

1114
01:45:40,737 --> 01:45:42,796
<i>Come in. This is Captain Rogers.
Do you read me?</i>

1115
01:45:43,072 --> 01:45:44,232
Captain Rogers, what is your...

1116
01:45:44,340 --> 01:45:45,739
Steve, is that you? Are you all right?

1117
01:45:45,842 --> 01:45:47,332
<i>Peggy, Schmidt's dead!</i>

1118
01:45:48,044 --> 01:45:49,568
<i>What about the plane?</i>

1119
01:45:51,447 --> 01:45:52,914
That's a little bit tougher to explain.

1120
01:45:53,383 --> 01:45:55,749
Give me your coordinates.
I'll find you a safe landing site.

1121
01:45:57,053 --> 01:45:59,146
There's not gonna be a safe landing.

1122
01:45:59,422 --> 01:46:01,014
<i>But I can try and force it down.</i>

1123
01:46:01,124 --> 01:46:03,092
I'll get Howard on the line.
He'll know what to do.

1124
01:46:03,192 --> 01:46:04,181
<i>There's not enough time.</i>

1125
01:46:04,293 --> 01:46:06,887
<i>This thing's moving too fast
and it's heading for New York.</i>

1126
01:46:11,501 --> 01:46:13,264
I got to put her in the water.

1127
01:46:13,736 --> 01:46:16,432
Please, don't do this.
We have time. We can work it out.

1128
01:46:16,739 --> 01:46:17,865
Right now I'm in the middle of nowhere.

1129
01:46:17,974 --> 01:46:20,374
If I wait any longer,
a lot of people are gonna die.

1130
01:46:25,915 --> 01:46:27,109
Peggy,

1131
01:46:28,918 --> 01:46:30,180
this is my choice.

1132
01:46:54,444 --> 01:46:55,570
Peggy?

1133
01:46:56,446 --> 01:46:57,743
<i>I'm here.</i>

1134
01:47:00,616 --> 01:47:03,414
I'm gonna need a rain check
on that dance.

1135
01:47:11,627 --> 01:47:12,753
All right.

1136
01:47:15,798 --> 01:47:18,164
A week, next Saturday,
at the Stork Club.

1137
01:47:19,635 --> 01:47:20,932
You got it.

1138
01:47:22,872 --> 01:47:26,831
<i>8:00 on the dot.
Don't you dare be late. Understood?</i>

1139
01:47:29,212 --> 01:47:31,271
You know,
I still don't know how to dance.

1140
01:47:37,487 --> 01:47:40,456
I'll show you how. Just be there.

1141
01:47:41,824 --> 01:47:43,451
We'll have the band
play something slow.

1142
01:47:47,563 --> 01:47:49,121
<i>I'd hate to step on your...</i>

1143
01:47:52,168 --> 01:47:53,135
Steve?

1144
01:47:55,671 --> 01:47:56,968
Steve?

1145
01:48:00,343 --> 01:48:01,537
Steve?

1146
01:49:00,603 --> 01:49:02,070
To the Captain.

1147
01:49:14,250 --> 01:49:15,217
Sir?

1148
01:49:25,361 --> 01:49:27,329
Take us to the next grid point.

1149
01:49:27,597 --> 01:49:29,656
But there's no trace of wreckage.

1150
01:49:30,366 --> 01:49:32,994
And the energy signature stops here.

1151
01:49:34,103 --> 01:49:35,832
Just keep looking.

1152
01:50:44,440 --> 01:50:46,965
<i>Curve ball,
high and outside for ball one.</i>

1153
01:50:48,277 --> 01:50:50,973
<i>So the Dodgers are tied, 4-4.</i>

1154
01:50:51,881 --> 01:50:54,247
<i>And the crowd well knows that
with one swing of his bat,</i>

1155
01:50:54,350 --> 01:50:57,217
<i>this fellow's capable of making it
a brand-new game again.</i>

1156
01:50:58,688 --> 01:51:01,816
<i>Just an absolutely gorgeous day
here at Ebbets Field.</i>

1157
01:51:02,692 --> 01:51:05,855
<i>The Phillies have managed
to tie it up at 4-4.</i>

1158
01:51:06,696 --> 01:51:08,994
<i>But the Dodgers have three men on.</i>

1159
01:51:13,536 --> 01:51:16,334
<i>Pearson beaned Reiser
in Philadelphia last month.</i>

1160
01:51:16,472 --> 01:51:19,600
<i>Wouldn't the youngster like a hit here
to return the favor?</i>

1161
01:51:20,042 --> 01:51:22,169
<i>Pete leans in. Here's the pitch.</i>

1162
01:51:22,545 --> 01:51:25,605
<i>Swung on. A line to the right.
And it gets past Rizzo.</i>

1163
01:51:27,550 --> 01:51:28,847
<i>Three runs will score.</i>

1164
01:51:29,218 --> 01:51:32,676
<i>Reiser heads to third.
Durocher's going to wave him in.</i>

1165
01:51:33,723 --> 01:51:36,021
<i>Here comes the relay,
but they won't get him.</i>

1166
01:51:37,493 --> 01:51:38,460
Good morning.

1167
01:51:40,496 --> 01:51:42,191
Or should I say afternoon?

1168
01:51:43,332 --> 01:51:44,356
Where am I?

1169
01:51:45,167 --> 01:51:47,158
You're in a recovery room
in New York City.

1170
01:51:49,071 --> 01:51:52,529
<i>The Dodgers take the lead, 8-4.
Oh, Dodgers!</i>

1171
01:51:52,908 --> 01:51:54,705
<i>Everyone is on their feet.</i>

1172
01:51:55,077 --> 01:51:58,410
<i>What a game we have here today, folks.
What a game, indeed.</i>

1173
01:51:58,514 --> 01:51:59,742
Where am I really?

1174
01:52:01,083 --> 01:52:03,051
I'm afraid I don't understand.

1175
01:52:03,853 --> 01:52:05,150
The game.

1176
01:52:05,354 --> 01:52:08,221
It's from May 1941.
I know, 'cause I was there.

1177
01:52:12,261 --> 01:52:14,229
Now, I'm going to ask you again.

1178
01:52:14,797 --> 01:52:15,764
Where am I?

1179
01:52:17,133 --> 01:52:18,430
- Captain Rogers...
- Who are you?

1180
01:52:26,075 --> 01:52:27,702
Captain Rogers, wait!

1181
01:52:29,545 --> 01:52:31,240
All agents, code 13!

1182
01:52:31,747 --> 01:52:34,580
<i>I repeat. All agents, code 13!</i>

1183
01:52:55,237 --> 01:52:56,761
At ease, soldier!

1184
01:53:05,347 --> 01:53:08,248
Look, I'm sorry about that little show
back there,

1185
01:53:09,585 --> 01:53:12,554
but we thought it best
to break it to you slowly.

1186
01:53:12,755 --> 01:53:14,052
Break what?

1187
01:53:16,492 --> 01:53:18,119
You've been asleep, Cap.

1188
01:53:18,627 --> 01:53:20,652
For almost 70 years.

1189
01:53:35,277 --> 01:53:36,471
You gonna be okay?

1190
01:53:37,613 --> 01:53:38,637
Yeah.

1191
01:53:39,014 --> 01:53:40,311
Yeah, I just...

1192
01:53:43,752 --> 01:53:45,242
I had a date.

1193
02:03:06,915 --> 02:03:08,542
Trouble sleeping?

1194
02:03:11,420 --> 02:03:12,717
You're here with a mission, sir?

1195
02:03:13,688 --> 02:03:14,677
I am.

1196
02:03:15,424 --> 02:03:17,221
Trying to get me back in the world?

1197
02:03:18,460 --> 02:03:19,688
Trying to save it.

1198
02:03:28,770 --> 02:03:30,533
<i>You think you're the only hero
in the world?</i>

1199
02:03:44,786 --> 02:03:45,912
Gentlemen?

1200
02:03:46,721 --> 02:03:47,779
You're up.

1201
02:03:53,762 --> 02:03:54,729
Got a mean swing.
