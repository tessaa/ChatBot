1
00:02:36,014 --> 00:02:38,634
Cowboy!
Get that man out of that jug!

2
00:02:38,672 --> 00:02:41,543
He say he not Cong.
We make him say he Cong.

3
00:02:41,585 --> 00:02:43,533
He can't say anything if
you drown him. Now get him out!

4
00:02:43,575 --> 00:02:45,069
Yes, sir, major. Instamment.

5
00:02:56,421 --> 00:02:58,244
Cowboy!

6
00:02:58,277 --> 00:03:01,477
He lie, major.
He goddamn bastard.

7
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:02,824
Put him back in the cage,
you hear me?

8
00:03:03,789 --> 00:03:05,449
God damn it, Cowboy!
Do you hear me?

9
00:03:05,486 --> 00:03:07,526
Yes, sir, major. Instamment.

10
00:03:55,493 --> 00:03:57,217
Any traffic?

11
00:03:57,254 --> 00:04:00,454
Uh, let's see. Mung Tau
wants to get lit up tonight.

12
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,736
You pass the signal
to Nighthawk?

13
00:04:01,772 --> 00:04:02,981
It's passed.

14
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:06,698
What are you juicing up now,
Ackley?

15
00:04:06,736 --> 00:04:08,114
Carrots and onions.

16
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:10,090
You think it'll cure
your pimples?

17
00:04:10,131 --> 00:04:12,237
It'll keep my bowels open
anyways.

18
00:04:16,795 --> 00:04:18,836
- AI.
- Major.

19
00:04:21,823 --> 00:04:23,801
"Instamment, major."

20
00:04:23,842 --> 00:04:26,212
I'm gonna zap that goddamn gook.

21
00:04:26,245 --> 00:04:27,678
Which gook, sir?

22
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,887
Cowboy. He had a prisoner
stuck in the water jug again.

23
00:04:30,924 --> 00:04:34,310
Well, you can't shoot
that goddamn gook, sir.

24
00:04:34,349 --> 00:04:38,380
He knows English, French,
Chinese, and 75 Viet dialects.

25
00:04:38,418 --> 00:04:42,100
I can shoot him. I can shoot him
and his goddamn dialects.

26
00:04:42,134 --> 00:04:43,249
Thank you, Kwan.

27
00:04:46,044 --> 00:04:48,020
I didn't get
my combat infantryman's badge.

28
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,722
Why not?

29
00:04:49,758 --> 00:04:51,286
New regulation from Saigon...

30
00:04:51,328 --> 00:04:53,022
that you gotta have
thirty days under fire.

31
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,620
I've only got twenty-two.

32
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:56,451
Well, I guess you'll have
to get out in the field, Al...

33
00:04:56,486 --> 00:04:57,731
and kick a little ass, huh?

34
00:04:57,768 --> 00:04:58,947
When, sir?

35
00:04:58,986 --> 00:05:02,055
When I don't need you here
anymore. What's the new map?

36
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:03,587
We got a query from Saigon...

37
00:05:03,628 --> 00:05:05,257
about some crummy hamlet
called Muc Wa.

38
00:05:05,296 --> 00:05:07,600
It's in this map plot here.

39
00:05:07,635 --> 00:05:09,360
What do they want?

40
00:05:09,397 --> 00:05:10,990
Complete position paper.

41
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,559
Oh, shit.

42
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,741
Too goddamn many
static defense posts as it is.

43
00:05:14,779 --> 00:05:16,242
That's what happened
to the French.

44
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:18,938
They got themselves tied down
in static defense.

45
00:05:18,976 --> 00:05:21,083
What do we know
about this... this Muc stuff?

46
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:22,332
Muc Wa.

47
00:05:22,371 --> 00:05:23,964
- Hey, sir.
- "Hey, sir."

48
00:05:24,003 --> 00:05:26,177
Jesus Christ.
What is it, Toffee?

49
00:05:26,214 --> 00:05:27,461
The replacements are here.

50
00:05:27,496 --> 00:05:29,351
Close the door a minute.

51
00:05:32,014 --> 00:05:34,185
Make up a position paper, Al.

52
00:05:34,222 --> 00:05:36,298
Tell them that Muc Fuck
has about...

53
00:05:36,338 --> 00:05:37,419
Muc Wa, sir.

54
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:39,829
Muc Wa. Muc Wa
has about two hundred people...

55
00:05:39,862 --> 00:05:41,774
mostly old men,
women, and children.

56
00:05:41,816 --> 00:05:44,152
No Cong activity there
for years.

57
00:05:44,186 --> 00:05:45,877
Severe drought conditions.
No water for troops.

58
00:05:45,915 --> 00:05:47,575
Uh, it's on a river, sir.

59
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:49,022
Well, fix it up.

60
00:05:49,055 --> 00:05:51,162
In the opinion
of this command...

61
00:05:51,202 --> 00:05:54,271
this hamlet is of no strategic
significance whatsoever?

62
00:05:54,309 --> 00:05:56,996
"Et shitera."
Toffee. Toffee?

63
00:05:57,032 --> 00:05:58,147
Yes, sir?

64
00:05:58,184 --> 00:06:00,074
- You got their papers?
- Yes.

65
00:06:08,628 --> 00:06:11,478
Hamilton, Raymond...
second lieutenant.

66
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:14,864
What the hell are they sending
us second lieutenants for?

67
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,966
All right, Toffee. Show the o...

68
00:06:19,007 --> 00:06:21,048
- Yes, sir.
- Show the officer in.

69
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,204
Yes, sir.

70
00:06:24,549 --> 00:06:26,079
Come in, lieutenant.

71
00:06:29,196 --> 00:06:31,585
Lieutenant Hamilton, sir.

72
00:06:31,628 --> 00:06:34,184
I'm Major Barker.
Captain Olivetti, the exec.

73
00:06:36,468 --> 00:06:38,159
- So, lieutenant?
- Sir!

74
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:40,140
Relax, kid. Sit down.

75
00:06:40,181 --> 00:06:41,843
Thank you, sir.

76
00:06:45,469 --> 00:06:46,745
How old are you, lieutenant?

77
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,639
Twenty-three, sir.

78
00:06:48,673 --> 00:06:50,200
And still a second?

79
00:06:51,331 --> 00:06:54,433
What the hell do they expect us
to do with you?

80
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,358
We don't have any slots
for second lieutenants.

81
00:06:58,154 --> 00:07:00,163
Send me into the field, sir.

82
00:07:00,204 --> 00:07:02,030
I feel that
I can kill communists...

83
00:07:02,064 --> 00:07:03,887
as well as any
first lieutenant, sir.

84
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:07,851
Well, let's not rush things.

85
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:09,782
Why did you volunteer
for Vietnam?

86
00:07:09,815 --> 00:07:11,825
Well, sir...

87
00:07:11,866 --> 00:07:13,809
I feel that
if my country's at war...

88
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:15,447
it's my duty to fight for it.

89
00:07:17,087 --> 00:07:18,616
All right, lieutenant.

90
00:07:18,657 --> 00:07:20,547
We'll see if we can't
find a slot for you.

91
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,588
Thank you, sir.

92
00:07:34,706 --> 00:07:36,715
Yeah.

93
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:38,035
Next!

94
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,818
Oleonowski, sir.

95
00:07:48,192 --> 00:07:49,439
How've you been, Oleo?

96
00:07:49,474 --> 00:07:50,905
Sir?

97
00:07:50,948 --> 00:07:52,705
Have I changed that much?

98
00:07:53,864 --> 00:07:56,418
Goddamn. Mr. Barker.

99
00:07:58,187 --> 00:07:59,366
Captain Olivetti, exec.

100
00:07:59,405 --> 00:08:02,604
- How do you do, sir?
- Oleo and I served in Korea.

101
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,649
He kept my butt from being
shot off more than once.

102
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,963
Well, he was a pretty good
officer, too, sir.

103
00:08:06,998 --> 00:08:10,198
Officers didn't have to be
very good with men like Oleo.

104
00:08:12,988 --> 00:08:14,265
Where have you been stationed?

105
00:08:14,301 --> 00:08:15,830
- South, sir. Delta.
- Hairy?

106
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,815
Oh, Jesus.

107
00:08:17,856 --> 00:08:19,517
I'll tell you, sir...

108
00:08:19,555 --> 00:08:22,241
I had three teams
shot out from under me.

109
00:08:25,418 --> 00:08:26,824
How's it up here, sir?

110
00:08:26,857 --> 00:08:29,579
Hairy sometimes, but
the casualties aren't too bad.

111
00:08:29,615 --> 00:08:31,525
That's good, sir.

112
00:08:32,498 --> 00:08:34,506
We'll find something for you,
Oleo.

113
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:36,490
Thank you, sir.

114
00:08:36,532 --> 00:08:38,444
It's nice to be
in your command again, sir.

115
00:08:41,882 --> 00:08:43,224
Sir.

116
00:08:47,744 --> 00:08:50,594
Put him in charge of weapons
training with a squad of puffs.

117
00:08:50,627 --> 00:08:52,004
I can use him in the field.

118
00:08:54,441 --> 00:08:56,678
He's burnt out, Al.
Let him rest.

119
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:59,399
Next!

120
00:09:09,689 --> 00:09:11,516
Lincoln, sir.

121
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,537
Abraham?

122
00:09:16,576 --> 00:09:18,169
Yes, sir.

123
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:19,870
<i>Well, we can use
a good bac si, corporal.</i>

124
00:09:19,908 --> 00:09:23,557
It says here you've been serving
with the dispensary in Saigon.

125
00:09:23,592 --> 00:09:25,634
- Yes, sir.
- Been out in the field much?

126
00:09:25,675 --> 00:09:27,051
Not much, sir.

127
00:09:27,084 --> 00:09:29,060
Why not?

128
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:30,828
They didn't assign me, sir.

129
00:09:32,434 --> 00:09:35,186
All right, corporal. That's all.

130
00:09:39,386 --> 00:09:41,395
Abraham Lincoln.

131
00:09:41,436 --> 00:09:44,504
How'd you like to go through
life with a moniker like that?

132
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:47,261
No wonder the poor bastard
looks like he's caved in.

133
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:50,616
- What'll I do with him?
- Assign him to clap control.

134
00:09:52,904 --> 00:09:55,906
Corporal Stephen Courcey,
college graduate.

135
00:09:55,947 --> 00:09:57,640
Draftee.

136
00:09:58,606 --> 00:10:00,648
This one's a draftee, Al.

137
00:10:00,687 --> 00:10:03,472
Demolitions training.
Well, that's S.O.P.

138
00:10:03,506 --> 00:10:06,031
Charlie blew up everything
around here ten years ago.

139
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,316
Next!

140
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:19,266
What's your name, soldier?

141
00:10:19,301 --> 00:10:20,829
Oh, sorry. Courcey, sir.

142
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:21,984
What are you doing here?

143
00:10:22,024 --> 00:10:24,164
- Sir?
- In Vietnam. You volunteered.

144
00:10:25,548 --> 00:10:27,404
Sir, if I had to be a soldier...

145
00:10:27,437 --> 00:10:29,163
I wanted to be in
the roughest, toughest outfit...

146
00:10:29,199 --> 00:10:30,728
in the U.S. Army, sir.

147
00:10:31,859 --> 00:10:33,387
Well, that's fine, corporal.

148
00:10:33,428 --> 00:10:36,081
But that adds six months
to your draft hitch, doesn't it?

149
00:10:36,119 --> 00:10:37,233
Yes, sir.

150
00:10:38,265 --> 00:10:39,509
Now, look, corporal...

151
00:10:39,546 --> 00:10:42,364
I'm going to ask you once again
what you're doing here...

152
00:10:42,398 --> 00:10:44,025
and don't give me
any of that crap...

153
00:10:44,064 --> 00:10:47,034
about the roughest, toughest
outfit in the U.S. Army.

154
00:10:47,075 --> 00:10:48,833
Does it matter, sir?

155
00:10:48,869 --> 00:10:51,294
The point is, I'm here
of my own choosing, sir.

156
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:55,146
All right, corporal. Dismissed.

157
00:11:02,259 --> 00:11:04,050
Now, what right
does a fucking draftee have...

158
00:11:04,086 --> 00:11:06,936
to volunteer for anything?
Or second lieutenants?

159
00:11:08,281 --> 00:11:10,072
What do you want me
to do with him, sir?

160
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,241
Put him on mosquito patrol?

161
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:15,933
What else?

162
00:11:25,195 --> 00:11:26,277
You and the corporal
got plenty...

163
00:11:26,317 --> 00:11:27,397
of insect repellant
on your faces?

164
00:11:27,438 --> 00:11:28,520
Yes, sir.

165
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,640
You don't have any on your arms,
do you?

166
00:11:29,681 --> 00:11:31,657
- No, sir.
- All right, lieutenant.

167
00:11:31,698 --> 00:11:34,035
Quartermaster people in Saigon
gotta have this information.

168
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,248
They gotta establish
priorities...

169
00:11:35,287 --> 00:11:36,783
for mosquito net
and an insect repellant.

170
00:11:36,825 --> 00:11:37,905
Yes, sir.

171
00:11:37,945 --> 00:11:39,737
You don't have to salute
all the time, lieutenant.

172
00:11:39,772 --> 00:11:41,661
Not out here in the boonies.

173
00:11:41,694 --> 00:11:43,156
Thank you, sir.

174
00:11:44,769 --> 00:11:46,745
OK, corporal, follow me.

175
00:12:07,323 --> 00:12:08,851
Any action?

176
00:12:08,892 --> 00:12:10,103
Not yet.

177
00:12:12,896 --> 00:12:14,208
- Toffee.
- Yeah, major.

178
00:12:14,242 --> 00:12:16,797
Any traffic from Mung Tau?

179
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:19,655
Uh, yeah. They're asking
for the flare ships.

180
00:12:19,688 --> 00:12:21,730
I told them they ought to be
up there in a few minutes.

181
00:12:23,532 --> 00:12:25,192
Charlie's on the prod again.

182
00:12:25,231 --> 00:12:27,053
God damn it,
I want to see those flares.

183
00:12:27,087 --> 00:12:29,774
Nighthawk control must have
Mung Tau runnin' out its ears.

184
00:12:29,811 --> 00:12:31,307
They flew forty-four hours
in there last week.

185
00:12:31,349 --> 00:12:33,586
Screw Nighthawk. I want
that fuckin' jungle lit up!

186
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:38,772
- Toffee.
- Yeah?

187
00:12:38,813 --> 00:12:41,182
- Send a signal to Nighthawk.
- There they go, sir.

188
00:12:41,215 --> 00:12:42,362
Forget it, Toffee.

189
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:48,612
Yeah. OK.

190
00:12:48,647 --> 00:12:51,234
Now they can kick
that little mother's ass.

191
00:12:56,271 --> 00:12:58,728
There's a firefight
out there somewhere.

192
00:12:58,769 --> 00:13:00,843
That's where I want to be.

193
00:13:02,518 --> 00:13:05,652
Well, we have our own duty
to perform, corporal.

194
00:13:05,689 --> 00:13:07,601
Ah, yeah.

195
00:13:07,643 --> 00:13:10,069
You count this time,
I'll expose.

196
00:13:10,111 --> 00:13:11,605
Oh, that's OK. I'll do it.

197
00:13:11,647 --> 00:13:15,744
No. I never ask my men to do
anything I won't do myself.

198
00:13:21,674 --> 00:13:23,366
OK... time.

199
00:13:25,198 --> 00:13:26,889
Five...

200
00:13:27,888 --> 00:13:29,964
Ten...

201
00:13:30,003 --> 00:13:31,085
Fifteen...

202
00:13:32,246 --> 00:13:33,775
Twenty...

203
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:37,401
Thirty seconds, sir.

204
00:13:37,435 --> 00:13:39,227
OK, count!

205
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,580
I get twenty-three, sir.

206
00:13:47,623 --> 00:13:50,309
Ow. They really zing you,
don't they?

207
00:13:50,345 --> 00:13:52,137
Maybe we'll get
a purple heart. Ha!

208
00:13:53,581 --> 00:13:55,556
I don't think
that's very funny, corporal.

209
00:13:56,816 --> 00:13:58,575
OK, let's get moving.

210
00:13:58,612 --> 00:14:01,069
We got four more stations
to run tests on.

211
00:14:37,053 --> 00:14:39,738
That amapola will kill you.

212
00:14:39,775 --> 00:14:42,625
It's altogether
fitting and proper.

213
00:14:42,658 --> 00:14:45,509
What the fuck
are you talking about?

214
00:14:45,542 --> 00:14:48,360
I'm telling you, that amapola
won't do you no good.

215
00:14:48,393 --> 00:14:51,242
It's the last full measure
of shit.

216
00:14:51,275 --> 00:14:52,838
You bet it is.

217
00:14:54,767 --> 00:14:57,355
How long you been on the hip?

218
00:14:57,394 --> 00:14:59,634
Four score and seven.

219
00:15:02,136 --> 00:15:04,473
Yeah, well, sweet dreams,
Abraham Lincoln.

220
00:15:04,507 --> 00:15:06,997
Berries from the earth, sir.

221
00:15:11,618 --> 00:15:13,442
That means fuck off.

222
00:15:28,822 --> 00:15:30,227
Hmm...

223
00:16:06,974 --> 00:16:08,382
Welcome to Penang,
General Harnitz.

224
00:16:08,414 --> 00:16:10,328
Captain Olivetti.

225
00:16:10,371 --> 00:16:12,379
Gentlemen, Captain McCain.

226
00:16:12,419 --> 00:16:14,427
Sorry I can't get here
more often, Asa.

227
00:16:14,469 --> 00:16:17,092
Got a lot of ground to cover,
though. A lot of ground.

228
00:16:17,129 --> 00:16:18,559
Captain,
you make your inspection...

229
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:20,263
while I powwow
with Major Barker.

230
00:16:20,301 --> 00:16:22,189
- Sergeant Oleonowski.
- Sir.

231
00:16:22,222 --> 00:16:24,395
See the captain has access
to anything he wishes to see.

232
00:16:24,432 --> 00:16:25,483
Yes, sir. This way, sir.

233
00:16:29,207 --> 00:16:30,580
Allow your men to wear...

234
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:32,691
those tiger-striped
frenchified fatigues?

235
00:16:32,731 --> 00:16:35,001
Strictly unauthorized
in this command, aren't they?

236
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:36,413
Well, sir,
I like to allow the men...

237
00:16:36,447 --> 00:16:37,789
some freedom in the field, sir.

238
00:16:37,824 --> 00:16:39,286
For the sake of esprit,
you know.

239
00:16:39,328 --> 00:16:42,366
Esprit. French word,
I believe, isn't it?

240
00:16:42,404 --> 00:16:43,780
I believe so.

241
00:16:43,813 --> 00:16:45,987
You know what happened
to the French in this country...

242
00:16:46,024 --> 00:16:48,167
they got the shit
kicked out of them.

243
00:16:48,204 --> 00:16:51,108
Now, that's not gonna happen
to the U.S. Army, Asa.

244
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,679
No, sir.

245
00:17:03,324 --> 00:17:05,431
All right, Asa... Muc Wa.

246
00:17:05,469 --> 00:17:06,550
Sir?

247
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:09,660
Muc Wa. Let's see
the coordinates with Muc Wa.

248
00:17:09,698 --> 00:17:11,773
Oh, it's on the wall...
Where is it, Al?

249
00:17:11,813 --> 00:17:14,629
- I took it down, sir.
- Well, put it up.

250
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:19,813
I sent in
a position paper, sir...

251
00:17:19,852 --> 00:17:21,644
to intelligence, as requested.

252
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,137
I read your position paper.
Put it over here.

253
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:25,257
Yes, sir.

254
00:17:25,297 --> 00:17:28,117
It said Muc Wa has
a population of two hundred...

255
00:17:28,151 --> 00:17:29,777
but according
to other information...

256
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:32,502
Muc Wa hasn't been inhabited
since 1953.

257
00:17:32,539 --> 00:17:36,666
You didn't reconnoiter Muc Wa.
I know your style, Asa.

258
00:17:36,703 --> 00:17:38,395
Everybody knows your style.

259
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:40,193
You're a good field officer...

260
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:42,465
but you are inclined
to have it your own way.

261
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,260
General,
I don't have the people.

262
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:47,169
My command is spread thinner
than the hairs on a baby's ass.

263
00:17:47,211 --> 00:17:50,314
I'm sure you can do it, Asa,
if you put your mind to it.

264
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:52,010
'Cause here's the situation.

265
00:17:52,047 --> 00:17:55,215
Muc Wa was abandoned
by the French in 1953.

266
00:17:55,252 --> 00:17:57,489
Shortly thereafter,
they lost the highway...

267
00:17:57,524 --> 00:17:59,601
from here to the sea.

268
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,026
Then Penang fell,
with two thousand defenders.

269
00:18:03,068 --> 00:18:04,827
Well, now,
we wouldn't want to repeat...

270
00:18:04,861 --> 00:18:07,004
the mistakes of the French,
would we?

271
00:18:07,042 --> 00:18:09,694
We want Muc Wa
reoccupied and garrisoned.

272
00:18:09,732 --> 00:18:11,488
And that's your job, Asa.

273
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:14,375
Cut the mustard, Asa,
and don't fuck around.

274
00:18:14,407 --> 00:18:15,970
Just cut it.

275
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,537
I'll do my best, sir.

276
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:19,405
Fine. I'll be watching.

277
00:18:59,031 --> 00:19:01,819
Old hard-nuts
lays it on you, doesn't he, sir?

278
00:19:01,852 --> 00:19:03,960
Yeah, well, I used to be
his commanding officer...

279
00:19:03,999 --> 00:19:05,756
chewed his ass out.

280
00:19:05,793 --> 00:19:07,418
Ass for ass, Al.

281
00:19:10,086 --> 00:19:12,476
How many gooks you got
working on that canal?

282
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,304
About thirty, sir, but Jesus!

283
00:19:15,338 --> 00:19:17,480
You heard the general.
Garrison Muc Wa.

284
00:19:17,517 --> 00:19:18,762
Give 'em shotguns...

285
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:20,972
and sprinkle a few machine guns
among them...

286
00:19:21,009 --> 00:19:24,397
just in case
Charlie should get interested.

287
00:19:24,438 --> 00:19:26,610
OK.

288
00:19:26,647 --> 00:19:30,678
And this new garrison will be
established here at Muc Wa.

289
00:19:30,717 --> 00:19:33,533
And you, Hamilton,
will be in command.

290
00:19:33,565 --> 00:19:34,908
Sir, I'm just a second...

291
00:19:34,942 --> 00:19:36,888
I know, but I've been
keeping my eye on you.

292
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:38,939
I've tested
your leadership abilities...

293
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,575
on the mosquito patrol...

294
00:19:40,615 --> 00:19:43,004
and I'm convinced
that you're the man for Muc Wa.

295
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:44,742
I'm recommending you
for promotion.

296
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:47,169
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

297
00:19:47,212 --> 00:19:50,349
Now, according to standing
operating procedures...

298
00:19:50,383 --> 00:19:53,291
we should have an ARVN officer
to lead the Viet troops...

299
00:19:53,332 --> 00:19:55,155
but we're short
of ARVN officers.

300
00:19:55,189 --> 00:19:57,843
In lieu of that,
I've assigned Sergeant Nguyen.

301
00:19:57,881 --> 00:20:01,178
He's a fine interpreter.
He'll be a big help to you.

302
00:20:01,211 --> 00:20:03,604
Major, I say this to you...

303
00:20:03,647 --> 00:20:05,887
Knock it off.

304
00:20:05,922 --> 00:20:07,198
You are also fortunate,
lieutenant...

305
00:20:07,234 --> 00:20:10,052
in having Sergeant Oleonowski
on your team.

306
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:11,713
He's an old hand in Nam...

307
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:14,405
and I advise you
to lean heavily on his judgment.

308
00:20:14,442 --> 00:20:15,524
Yes, sir.

309
00:20:15,565 --> 00:20:17,452
I'm also giving you
Corporal Ackley...

310
00:20:17,486 --> 00:20:20,784
as your signal man and
Corporal Lincoln as your medic...

311
00:20:20,816 --> 00:20:22,640
both experienced men.

312
00:20:22,674 --> 00:20:25,013
Corporal Courcey will act
as your weapons specialist.

313
00:20:25,046 --> 00:20:26,935
My primary is demolitions, sir.

314
00:20:26,968 --> 00:20:29,140
Good.
And now, lieutenant...

315
00:20:29,177 --> 00:20:31,220
your troops
will be moved by truck...

316
00:20:31,261 --> 00:20:32,756
to a point
on the inland highway...

317
00:20:32,796 --> 00:20:34,776
about a half-hour's march
into Muc Wa.

318
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:36,673
Captain Olivetti
will brief you as to the time...

319
00:20:36,706 --> 00:20:38,269
and organization
of your departure.

320
00:20:38,309 --> 00:20:39,388
Any questions?

321
00:20:39,429 --> 00:20:40,512
- Sir?
- Yes?

322
00:20:40,551 --> 00:20:43,335
Sir, I feel I have
a fine team here...

323
00:20:43,369 --> 00:20:45,925
and I'm sure
I speak for all my men...

324
00:20:45,965 --> 00:20:49,164
we appreciate this opportunity
to fight for our country, sir.

325
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,819
Very well said, lieutenant.
That's all, men.

326
00:20:52,948 --> 00:20:55,339
Oleonowski, please remain
for a few minutes.

327
00:20:56,793 --> 00:20:58,199
Thank you, sir.

328
00:21:04,386 --> 00:21:05,498
OK, Oleo.

329
00:21:05,538 --> 00:21:08,093
That gook company is
a bunch of paddy farmers, sir.

330
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:09,379
I saw them being mustered.

331
00:21:09,415 --> 00:21:11,620
They got shotguns.
Jesus Christ, sir!

332
00:21:13,867 --> 00:21:15,779
This garrison, this Muc Wa.

333
00:21:15,821 --> 00:21:17,512
No reason for Charlie
to be there.

334
00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:19,081
In fact, Charlie
hasn't been reported...

335
00:21:19,121 --> 00:21:20,553
within fifty miles of the site.

336
00:21:20,595 --> 00:21:23,116
Any place we turn up, sir,
Charlie turns up.

337
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:24,434
You know that, sir.

338
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:27,637
Oleo, I'm giving you
a squad of crack mercenaries...

339
00:21:27,674 --> 00:21:31,640
as insurance, just in case
you do contact the Cong.

340
00:21:31,678 --> 00:21:32,923
OK?

341
00:21:33,984 --> 00:21:35,612
OK, major.

342
00:21:38,951 --> 00:21:40,063
That's all.

343
00:21:53,558 --> 00:21:54,869
Shit.

344
00:22:16,014 --> 00:22:19,182
General Patton's gonna make
a speech to his troops.

345
00:22:19,218 --> 00:22:22,799
Men, we have been ordered
to march into the jungle...

346
00:22:24,826 --> 00:22:26,737
where we will establish
a fortress...

347
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:28,342
for liberty and justice.

348
00:22:39,655 --> 00:22:41,543
What are they laughin' about?

349
00:22:41,576 --> 00:22:43,720
They pleased much, sir.

350
00:22:44,812 --> 00:22:46,987
- You sure?
- Certainement.

351
00:22:47,025 --> 00:22:48,486
Dinks laugh all the time,
lieutenant.

352
00:22:48,529 --> 00:22:50,508
Don't let it bother you.

353
00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:52,109
Well, that's enough, then.

354
00:22:55,577 --> 00:22:57,240
<i>Sat Cong!</i>

355
00:22:57,277 --> 00:22:58,683
<i>Sat Cong!</i>

356
00:22:58,717 --> 00:23:00,062
<i>Sat Cong!</i>

357
00:23:00,095 --> 00:23:01,818
<i>Sat Cong! Sat Cong!</i>

358
00:23:01,856 --> 00:23:04,991
<i>- Sat Cong!
- Sat Cong!</i>

359
00:23:05,027 --> 00:23:06,240
What's he doing?

360
00:23:06,278 --> 00:23:09,926
Stirring them up. They're
saying, "Kill communists."

361
00:23:09,962 --> 00:23:14,571
<i>- Sat Cong!
- Sat Cong!</i>

362
00:23:33,729 --> 00:23:35,587
- OK, old man?
- Yeah, OK.

363
00:23:35,621 --> 00:23:36,866
All right!

364
00:23:56,733 --> 00:23:58,623
Fucking draftee.

365
00:23:58,656 --> 00:24:00,861
I still don't know
what the hell he's doing here.

366
00:24:26,622 --> 00:24:28,412
Why are we going so fast?

367
00:24:28,447 --> 00:24:31,318
We don't travel slow
anywhere in this country.

368
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,732
Snipers. Charlie.

369
00:24:59,168 --> 00:25:01,471
- What's that?
- Stay down, lieutenant.

370
00:25:05,575 --> 00:25:06,918
Get out!

371
00:25:06,951 --> 00:25:08,360
We ambushed?

372
00:25:12,271 --> 00:25:13,383
Courcey!

373
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:18,674
- Yeah, sarge.
- Check that roadblock.

374
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:19,789
Me?

375
00:25:19,829 --> 00:25:21,140
You're a demolitions man,
aren't you?

376
00:25:21,175 --> 00:25:22,290
Yeah.

377
00:25:56,767 --> 00:25:59,072
Tripwire, off to the left.

378
00:25:59,105 --> 00:26:00,282
- Cowboy.
- Yes, sir.

379
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,784
Charlie's in a hidey hole.
Get him.

380
00:26:37,803 --> 00:26:39,528
Medic!

381
00:26:40,493 --> 00:26:42,953
Courcey.
Where's Corporal Lincoln?

382
00:26:42,994 --> 00:26:44,422
Coming, sir!

383
00:26:46,611 --> 00:26:48,916
Corporal, take care
of this prisoner's wound.

384
00:26:52,796 --> 00:26:55,997
Sergeant, do you think
he's the only one out there?

385
00:26:56,033 --> 00:26:57,789
Yes, sir.
They'll throw up a roadblock...

386
00:26:57,824 --> 00:27:00,281
and leave one man behind to
blow it when somebody moves it.

387
00:27:00,323 --> 00:27:02,115
He could've been squattin' out
there for three or four days.

388
00:27:02,151 --> 00:27:03,743
- Ackley?
- Yes, sir.

389
00:27:03,783 --> 00:27:05,062
Get a signal off to Penang.

390
00:27:05,098 --> 00:27:07,686
Report this incident...
the time and location.

391
00:27:07,724 --> 00:27:10,541
Sergeant Nguyen, I want you
to question the prisoner...

392
00:27:10,574 --> 00:27:12,877
name, where he's from,
where his friends are.

393
00:27:12,912 --> 00:27:14,093
Won't do any good, lieutenant.

394
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:15,537
He won't say anything.
They never do.

395
00:27:33,673 --> 00:27:35,232
That's enough, sergeant.

396
00:27:35,272 --> 00:27:37,316
OK, let's move out.

397
00:27:52,572 --> 00:27:54,361
You're crazy.

398
00:27:55,903 --> 00:27:57,182
You're crazy.

399
00:28:01,703 --> 00:28:03,907
- You're crazy!
- It's all right. OK.

400
00:28:03,942 --> 00:28:05,506
- You're crazy!
- All right, listen to me.

401
00:28:05,546 --> 00:28:07,457
He cut his head off! His head!

402
00:28:07,499 --> 00:28:10,569
I don't give a damn!
You listen to me!

403
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:13,482
Kid, that's what it's like
in this fuckin' war.

404
00:28:30,756 --> 00:28:32,221
<i>Sat Cong.</i>

405
00:28:33,288 --> 00:28:34,435
OK.

406
00:28:34,474 --> 00:28:35,785
Bury him.

407
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:38,660
Lincoln,
look after the lieutenant.

408
00:28:38,703 --> 00:28:40,711
Give him something
for his stomach.

409
00:28:43,795 --> 00:28:45,653
You nailed to the ground,
Courcey?

410
00:28:45,687 --> 00:28:47,029
Go puke with the lieutenant.

411
00:28:47,063 --> 00:28:48,593
I'm not gonna puke.

412
00:28:48,634 --> 00:28:51,418
It's their war, Courcey!

413
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:19,898
According to the map,
this is it, lieutenant.

414
00:29:19,931 --> 00:29:21,393
Road to Muc Wa.

415
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,753
Cowboy, flankers out.

416
00:29:27,588 --> 00:29:30,046
Detail five men to set up
the rear guard with Courcey.

417
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:35,011
Courcey,
you're rear guard advisor.

418
00:29:35,051 --> 00:29:36,580
Wait a minute. How am I
supposed to advise them?

419
00:29:36,621 --> 00:29:38,510
Stay a hundred yards behind us.
Keep looking over your shoulder.

420
00:29:38,542 --> 00:29:41,262
Anything moves back there,
zap it.

421
00:29:44,051 --> 00:29:46,227
Cowboy, set the point.

422
00:29:47,415 --> 00:29:48,760
This way.

423
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:55,415
Sergeant Nguyen,
give the order to move out.

424
00:30:35,852 --> 00:30:38,954
OK, uh, uh...

425
00:30:40,018 --> 00:30:41,844
Let's... let's go, men.

426
00:30:54,692 --> 00:30:56,121
That goddamn roadblock
wasn't there...

427
00:30:56,163 --> 00:30:57,955
yesterday afternoon at 5:00.

428
00:30:57,991 --> 00:31:00,841
The scout plane cased that route
for seventy-five klicks.

429
00:31:00,874 --> 00:31:03,110
Maybe they just accidentally
decided to block that route.

430
00:31:03,146 --> 00:31:05,320
Shit, the V.C. Doesn't do
anything accidentally.

431
00:31:05,358 --> 00:31:06,919
They knew that convoy
was coming.

432
00:31:06,959 --> 00:31:08,620
They know everything
we're gonna do.

433
00:31:08,657 --> 00:31:10,184
And we don't know
a damn thing they're gonna do.

434
00:31:10,226 --> 00:31:11,306
Hey, major.

435
00:31:11,346 --> 00:31:13,456
A distribution package
from Saigon just came in.

436
00:31:13,495 --> 00:31:15,089
Well, let me have it, eh?

437
00:31:15,128 --> 00:31:17,517
- It's got a lieutenant with it.
- What lieutenant?

438
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,642
I think that'd be...

439
00:31:18,683 --> 00:31:19,961
our psychological warfare
specialist...

440
00:31:19,997 --> 00:31:21,078
from General Harnitz.

441
00:31:21,118 --> 00:31:22,614
Table of organization
requires one.

442
00:31:22,656 --> 00:31:24,480
It's a new directive.
You read it, sir.

443
00:31:24,514 --> 00:31:26,304
Oh, yes, yes.
All right, Toffee, bring him in.

444
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,644
And, Toffee, try not to say
"Hey" to the lieutenant...

445
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:29,761
if you can help it.

446
00:31:29,801 --> 00:31:31,654
Right, major.

447
00:31:32,812 --> 00:31:33,924
Hey, lieutenant!

448
00:31:43,381 --> 00:31:44,945
Major Barker.

449
00:31:44,984 --> 00:31:46,807
Wattsberg, Finley, sir.

450
00:31:46,841 --> 00:31:49,366
We've been expecting you,
lieutenant. Captain Olivetti.

451
00:31:49,406 --> 00:31:51,644
- How do you do, sir?
- OK.

452
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,551
Oh, your distribution packet,
sir.

453
00:31:58,343 --> 00:32:00,134
So, you're the new
psycho specialist, huh?

454
00:32:00,169 --> 00:32:02,558
Covert warfare psychological
specialist, yes, sir.

455
00:32:02,602 --> 00:32:03,946
What are you gonna do
for us, lieutenant?

456
00:32:03,981 --> 00:32:06,219
Post the incident flow
priority indicator, sir.

457
00:32:06,255 --> 00:32:07,981
Great. What's that?

458
00:32:08,017 --> 00:32:09,447
Allow me, sir.

459
00:32:15,097 --> 00:32:17,304
This, sir, is the indicator.

460
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:21,021
A computer in Saigon will
sift all intelligence reports...

461
00:32:21,056 --> 00:32:22,583
and reduce the information...

462
00:32:22,624 --> 00:32:24,569
to parables, ratios,
and mean averages...

463
00:32:24,612 --> 00:32:27,233
whereby we shall be able
to assign defense priorities.

464
00:32:27,271 --> 00:32:31,203
That is, sir,
the incident flow indicator...

465
00:32:31,243 --> 00:32:33,219
will indicate
which of your outposts...

466
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,440
is the most endangered.

467
00:32:35,471 --> 00:32:38,572
I'll enter that name
on the indicator here...

468
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:39,692
condition red.

469
00:32:39,732 --> 00:32:42,604
Number two
will be condition orange.

470
00:32:42,647 --> 00:32:45,584
Number three... condition yellow.

471
00:32:48,189 --> 00:32:49,753
You mean...

472
00:32:49,791 --> 00:32:52,990
you are going to tell us
where the V.C. Will attack...

473
00:32:53,026 --> 00:32:54,141
before they do it?

474
00:32:54,178 --> 00:32:57,151
With reasonable accuracy, sir.

475
00:32:58,215 --> 00:33:00,192
That'll be the goddamn day.

476
00:33:00,234 --> 00:33:02,657
I assure you, sir,
it works remarkably well.

477
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:04,937
Toffee!

478
00:33:05,936 --> 00:33:07,081
Where shall I hang it, sir?

479
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:09,546
Stick it over the door.

480
00:33:11,766 --> 00:33:14,157
Excellent.
Very... prominent, sir.

481
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:16,091
I'll make the first entries
tomorrow, sir.

482
00:33:16,123 --> 00:33:17,204
I can't wait.

483
00:33:17,243 --> 00:33:19,221
Toffee. See the lieutenant
has quarters...

484
00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:20,669
and a place out there to work.

485
00:33:20,703 --> 00:33:22,267
- Sure.
- Thank you, sir.

486
00:33:32,783 --> 00:33:34,025
Where are we, Al?

487
00:33:34,062 --> 00:33:36,203
I mean geographically,
where are we?

488
00:33:36,241 --> 00:33:38,153
Vietnam. Penang, sir.

489
00:33:38,195 --> 00:33:40,269
You sure
we're not in a loony bin?

490
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:44,569
Sometimes I get the feeling
we're in a goddamn loony bin.

491
00:33:51,811 --> 00:33:53,469
Sergeant.

492
00:33:55,175 --> 00:33:56,668
Lieutenant.

493
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:57,825
Muc Wa.

494
00:33:58,825 --> 00:34:00,933
It's almost time for
the helicopter. Let's move out.

495
00:34:00,973 --> 00:34:02,632
Lieutenant,
hold on just a minute.

496
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:04,264
Cowboy, VARs.

497
00:35:27,785 --> 00:35:29,412
OK, lieutenant, we go in fast...

498
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:31,080
and lay some smoke
for the choppers.

499
00:35:31,118 --> 00:35:32,580
Move out!

500
00:36:41,626 --> 00:36:42,709
OK, I got it.

501
00:36:42,748 --> 00:36:44,986
Keep it moving.

502
00:36:49,697 --> 00:36:50,779
All right, let's get cracking.

503
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,480
Cowboy, get that bunker
over there cleaned up...

504
00:36:52,518 --> 00:36:53,598
for the lieutenant's
command post.

505
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:54,722
- Ackley!
- Behind you!

506
00:36:54,761 --> 00:36:56,255
Set your commo shack
up in there next to him.

507
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:58,602
Lincoln! Find yourself
a hospital somewhere.

508
00:36:58,636 --> 00:36:59,716
- Courcey!
- Yo!

509
00:36:59,757 --> 00:37:00,937
Have all three points
in the triangle...

510
00:37:00,975 --> 00:37:02,732
manned and ready
in fifteen minutes.

511
00:37:02,769 --> 00:37:04,199
Excuse me for taking over
like this, sir...

512
00:37:04,242 --> 00:37:06,895
but we got to get this garrison
shaped up before Charlie time.

513
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,561
Night. That's Charlie time.

514
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,062
Fine, Sergeant,
but what can I do?

515
00:37:10,105 --> 00:37:12,472
You make yourself comfortable,
sir. You're the officer.

516
00:37:12,506 --> 00:37:13,490
- Cowboy!
- Yes, sir.

517
00:37:13,533 --> 00:37:15,607
Assign every man
a place on the wall.

518
00:37:15,646 --> 00:37:17,688
I want all the underbrush
cut down.

519
00:37:17,729 --> 00:37:19,520
Nobody sleeps tonight,
not till we find out...

520
00:37:19,556 --> 00:37:21,248
what kind of asshole situation
we got here.

521
00:37:21,285 --> 00:37:22,464
Now let's move it along!

522
00:37:22,502 --> 00:37:25,286
Come on, boys, chop it up,
chop it up! Let's go, let's go!

523
00:37:25,321 --> 00:37:27,234
Night's comin', baby!
Move it out!

524
00:38:16,289 --> 00:38:17,915
You read French, corporal?

525
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:22,014
Fairly well, sir.

526
00:38:22,055 --> 00:38:25,058
I think it refers
to the battle of Thermopylae...

527
00:38:25,099 --> 00:38:27,818
where the 300 Spartans died
trying to hold the pass...

528
00:38:27,852 --> 00:38:29,993
if you remember
your Greek history, sir.

529
00:38:30,031 --> 00:38:31,822
Yeah.

530
00:38:31,858 --> 00:38:34,249
It says, roughly...

531
00:38:34,293 --> 00:38:36,051
"Stranger...

532
00:38:36,085 --> 00:38:38,479
"when you find us lying here...

533
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,557
go tell the Spartans
we obeyed their orders."

534
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:54,570
You think there's three hundred
French buried here?

535
00:39:03,155 --> 00:39:05,261
I'll count 'em
first chance I get, sir.

536
00:39:08,857 --> 00:39:10,748
Hey, major?

537
00:39:11,868 --> 00:39:14,688
Hey, major, we got communication
established with Muc Wa.

538
00:39:14,721 --> 00:39:17,058
Well, read it to me, hey.

539
00:39:17,091 --> 00:39:19,232
"Operation Blaze
to blah, blah, blah...

540
00:39:19,269 --> 00:39:21,605
"French fortifications
in usable condition.

541
00:39:21,639 --> 00:39:24,164
"Team morale excellent.
No enemy contact.

542
00:39:24,203 --> 00:39:26,376
"Standing operating procedures
in effect.

543
00:39:26,414 --> 00:39:28,104
"We shall do our duty.

544
00:39:28,141 --> 00:39:30,797
Lieutenant Hamilton,
Commander, Operation Blaze."

545
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:32,591
Let me have it. OK, Toffee.

546
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:38,738
"We shall do our duty."
Jesus Christ.

547
00:39:45,346 --> 00:39:48,162
We better get some aerial
photographs of this place...

548
00:39:48,196 --> 00:39:49,858
have 'em brought up in detail.

549
00:39:49,894 --> 00:39:54,120
I wanna know how it lies like
I know the wrinkles on my face.

550
00:39:54,154 --> 00:39:55,586
OK, major.

551
00:40:12,575 --> 00:40:13,821
- Sergeant?
- Sir.

552
00:40:13,857 --> 00:40:15,420
Now, why are you leaving
three gates in the walls?

553
00:40:15,459 --> 00:40:17,216
You're giving the enemy
too many ways to break in.

554
00:40:17,253 --> 00:40:19,264
Sir, them gates
is for us to break out of...

555
00:40:19,301 --> 00:40:20,513
if and when the time comes.

556
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:22,725
Don't worry about Charlie
breaking in.

557
00:40:22,763 --> 00:40:24,903
He'll come over these walls
like a forest fire.

558
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:26,504
Over the barbed wire?

559
00:40:26,541 --> 00:40:28,138
Well, sir, the dinks
don't feel any pain.

560
00:40:28,177 --> 00:40:29,968
The barbed wire just makes 'em
itch a little.

561
00:40:30,002 --> 00:40:31,564
Well, that's hard to believe,
sergeant.

562
00:40:31,604 --> 00:40:33,973
Well, sir, I hope you don't
have to see it to believe it.

563
00:40:34,006 --> 00:40:38,266
Well, three gates. That's fine.
Excuse me.

564
00:40:42,783 --> 00:40:44,380
Lieutenant's got the quick-step.

565
00:40:49,158 --> 00:40:51,071
Yeah, well, he'll get over it.

566
00:40:52,618 --> 00:40:54,856
Some do, and some don't.

567
00:40:54,892 --> 00:40:57,196
Me, I think the lieutenant's
on the don't side.

568
00:41:22,026 --> 00:41:23,881
What is it?

569
00:41:23,915 --> 00:41:24,998
What is it?

570
00:41:25,037 --> 00:41:27,461
Nuoc mam.
Somebody used fish sauce.

571
00:41:29,075 --> 00:41:30,602
I don't smell anything.

572
00:41:30,642 --> 00:41:32,109
We smell.

573
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:33,973
Well...

574
00:41:34,007 --> 00:41:35,798
let's get off this trail.

575
00:42:03,992 --> 00:42:05,587
Cong. We attack.

576
00:42:05,627 --> 00:42:07,221
Well, let's make damn sure
before you start shootin'.

577
00:42:07,261 --> 00:42:09,433
- No. Shoot first.
- Wait a minute.

578
00:42:09,469 --> 00:42:11,129
We'll take a look first.

579
00:42:27,473 --> 00:42:29,035
Some Cong.

580
00:42:32,247 --> 00:42:34,389
Hello!

581
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:35,802
No! I'm an American!

582
00:42:35,835 --> 00:42:38,653
Uh, tell your men
to lower their rifles.

583
00:42:38,685 --> 00:42:39,930
Tell 'em.

584
00:42:43,747 --> 00:42:46,019
Wrong, sir.
They communist people.

585
00:42:46,054 --> 00:42:48,095
We'll see. Hold my rifle.

586
00:42:49,256 --> 00:42:52,129
I'm... I am your friend.

587
00:42:52,172 --> 00:42:54,924
Tell 'em. Interpret.

588
00:42:54,959 --> 00:42:58,760
I'm... I'm not going to hurt you.

589
00:43:00,534 --> 00:43:01,777
Interpret!

590
00:43:03,738 --> 00:43:06,423
L... I have some chocolate.

591
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:08,950
I have some chocolate.
It's good.

592
00:43:12,771 --> 00:43:14,496
<i>Chocolat.</i>

593
00:43:16,649 --> 00:43:18,143
It's good.

594
00:43:19,403 --> 00:43:21,257
It's all right.

595
00:43:32,538 --> 00:43:33,965
Mmm. That's good.

596
00:43:36,893 --> 00:43:39,199
Try a piece, hmm? Please?

597
00:43:44,838 --> 00:43:46,268
It's good.

598
00:43:54,481 --> 00:43:55,724
Yeah.

599
00:43:55,761 --> 00:43:56,876
It's good.

600
00:43:58,613 --> 00:44:00,470
Here's a piece for you.

601
00:44:02,232 --> 00:44:03,958
And here's a piece for you.

602
00:44:03,994 --> 00:44:05,456
They Cong, sir.

603
00:44:05,498 --> 00:44:08,853
Who cares? They're hungry.

604
00:44:08,895 --> 00:44:10,839
Here you go.

605
00:44:16,841 --> 00:44:19,231
- She's nice.
- What are you, the Pied Piper?

606
00:44:19,275 --> 00:44:20,323
God damn it, Courcey,
I send you out...

607
00:44:20,364 --> 00:44:21,574
to map
the fuckin' jungle trails...

608
00:44:21,612 --> 00:44:23,523
you come back with
a bunch of sick-Iookin' dinks!

609
00:44:23,567 --> 00:44:25,807
What the hell am I supposed
to do with them?

610
00:44:25,843 --> 00:44:28,365
- They Cong.
- They're refugees.

611
00:44:28,405 --> 00:44:31,254
- Ahh.
- It's a goddamn lie.

612
00:44:31,287 --> 00:44:33,178
- They Cong family.
- No, they're not.

613
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:35,154
What is it, sergeant?
Who are these people?

614
00:44:35,196 --> 00:44:36,474
Courcey dragged them
out of the pocket bush.

615
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:38,136
Cowboy,
give 'em rice and run 'em off.

616
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:41,026
Now, just a moment. Now, your
attitude is wrong, sergeant.

617
00:44:41,058 --> 00:44:42,140
It is part of our job here...

618
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:43,936
to win the hearts and minds
of the people.

619
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:45,119
- Sir...
- We will make them welcome.

620
00:44:45,159 --> 00:44:46,338
Sir, you don't understand.

621
00:44:46,377 --> 00:44:48,288
I understand my duty, sergeant.

622
00:44:48,331 --> 00:44:50,502
Now, Corporal Lincoln, take
these ladies to the hospital...

623
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:52,004
and give them a health check.

624
00:44:52,047 --> 00:44:53,772
Corporal Courcey,
I'll make you responsible...

625
00:44:53,809 --> 00:44:55,370
for seeing
they have food and shelter.

626
00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:58,796
Sir, Cowboy says
this is a Cong family.

627
00:45:01,945 --> 00:45:03,834
They don't look
like communists to me.

628
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,976
Sir, I been in this fuckin' war
for three years.

629
00:45:06,015 --> 00:45:08,471
I still don't know
what a communist looks like.

630
00:45:08,511 --> 00:45:10,903
Corporal Courcey, were
these people armed in any way?

631
00:45:10,946 --> 00:45:11,876
No, sir.

632
00:45:11,908 --> 00:45:13,819
Well, there you are, sergeant.

633
00:45:13,862 --> 00:45:15,873
Carry on as directed,
Corporal Lincoln.

634
00:45:15,913 --> 00:45:17,769
All right.
Tell the slopes to follow me.

635
00:45:17,803 --> 00:45:19,050
Lincoln...

636
00:45:19,086 --> 00:45:20,810
you better pop that little cunt
full of penicillin...

637
00:45:20,846 --> 00:45:23,531
before the whole barracks
comes down with the clap.

638
00:45:53,169 --> 00:45:56,401
What's Boo Jum doing in the red?
Mung Tau ought to be in the red.

639
00:45:56,436 --> 00:45:59,735
No, sir, Mung Tau is definitely
declining in incident ratio.

640
00:45:59,767 --> 00:46:00,882
My flow chart indicates...

641
00:46:00,921 --> 00:46:02,482
that the next
concentrated offensive...

642
00:46:02,522 --> 00:46:03,572
will be against Boo Jum.

643
00:46:03,612 --> 00:46:06,616
There hasn't been a shot fired
in Boo Jum in three months.

644
00:46:06,656 --> 00:46:07,865
Sir, if you wish me
to explain...

645
00:46:07,903 --> 00:46:09,599
the incremental
digital contingencies...

646
00:46:09,635 --> 00:46:11,709
and the compatible
logistical projection...

647
00:46:11,749 --> 00:46:14,500
by which the flow chart
has arrived at red for Boo Jum...

648
00:46:14,535 --> 00:46:16,994
Forget it, forget it. It's got
the toughest fortifications...

649
00:46:17,036 --> 00:46:19,461
of any of the outposts,
and Charlie knows it.

650
00:46:19,502 --> 00:46:21,161
Hey!

651
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:22,794
Hey, major, where you going?

652
00:46:22,834 --> 00:46:24,428
I mean, just in case
I get some traffic.

653
00:46:26,132 --> 00:46:27,957
I'm going to Tapang,
to a boom-boom joint...

654
00:46:27,991 --> 00:46:30,099
and get my ashes hauled, OK?

655
00:46:30,139 --> 00:46:31,546
Sure. OK.

656
00:46:32,892 --> 00:46:34,005
Thanks.

657
00:46:35,038 --> 00:46:37,245
Be back by Charlie time.

658
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,421
World War II.

659
00:46:39,459 --> 00:46:40,572
What?

660
00:46:40,611 --> 00:46:43,931
That's what I call the major,
World War II.

661
00:46:43,976 --> 00:46:45,701
Precisely.

662
00:47:46,925 --> 00:47:48,102
On the hill!

663
00:47:49,327 --> 00:47:50,409
I think it's Cong!

664
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:53,201
- How many?
- I just saw one.

665
00:47:53,236 --> 00:47:55,211
- Right over there.
- Move it, move it!

666
00:47:55,253 --> 00:47:57,327
Hit all three points!
Come on, move your ass!

667
00:47:57,366 --> 00:47:59,061
Move it!

668
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,681
That's pretty good.

669
00:48:06,723 --> 00:48:09,146
Little mothers might give
Charlie a show at that.

670
00:48:12,041 --> 00:48:13,633
Come on!

671
00:48:16,108 --> 00:48:17,997
Was that another drill,
sergeant?

672
00:48:18,029 --> 00:48:19,145
No, sir. We got a contact.

673
00:48:19,185 --> 00:48:21,226
Enemy scout overlookin' us
from the hill.

674
00:48:21,266 --> 00:48:23,025
I spotted him
in the cemetery, sir.

675
00:48:23,059 --> 00:48:25,102
He left this note.

676
00:48:26,389 --> 00:48:28,401
Charlie likes to leave
calling cards, sir.

677
00:48:28,442 --> 00:48:30,198
Better set ambush patrols
tonight and every night.

678
00:48:30,234 --> 00:48:31,864
Of course, sergeant.
I'll lead one myself.

679
00:48:31,901 --> 00:48:33,910
You might wanna wait till
you feel a little up to it, sir.

680
00:48:33,951 --> 00:48:35,033
Courcey will take
one patrol tonight.

681
00:48:35,073 --> 00:48:36,153
Cowboy will take the other.

682
00:48:36,192 --> 00:48:37,274
Yeah, I think you ought
to get off your feet, sir.

683
00:48:37,314 --> 00:48:38,527
Just stay sort of quiet.

684
00:48:38,565 --> 00:48:39,974
Yes, sir, we might not
get much sleep tonight...

685
00:48:40,006 --> 00:48:41,119
if Charlie probes us.

686
00:48:41,159 --> 00:48:42,533
Yeah.

687
00:48:42,567 --> 00:48:44,643
Well, I'll be in my quarters
if you need me.

688
00:48:44,683 --> 00:48:46,026
Yes, sir.

689
00:48:52,403 --> 00:48:54,292
Amoebic.

690
00:48:54,325 --> 00:48:55,602
Yeah.

691
00:50:03,392 --> 00:50:06,047
 Fourscore 

692
00:50:06,084 --> 00:50:07,841
 And 

693
00:50:07,878 --> 00:50:10,181
 And seven 

694
00:50:10,216 --> 00:50:12,642
 Years ago 

695
00:50:14,862 --> 00:50:19,534
 Our fathers brought forth
on this continent 

696
00:50:19,569 --> 00:50:21,329
 A new nation 

697
00:50:21,365 --> 00:50:25,198
 Conceived in liberty 

698
00:50:25,242 --> 00:50:27,381
 Dedicated 

699
00:50:27,418 --> 00:50:29,559
 To the proposition 

700
00:50:29,597 --> 00:50:31,223
 All men 

701
00:50:31,262 --> 00:50:33,753
 Are created equal 

702
00:50:34,723 --> 00:50:35,868
 Brave 

703
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:37,186
 Uh, men 

704
00:50:37,222 --> 00:50:40,575
 Living and dead 

705
00:50:40,619 --> 00:50:43,620
 Who struggled here 

706
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:45,219
 Have consecrated it 

707
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:48,648
 Far above our poor 

708
00:50:48,689 --> 00:50:50,699
 Power to add 

709
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:52,880
 Or detract... 

710
00:50:54,522 --> 00:50:56,148
Fire!

711
00:50:56,186 --> 00:50:57,530
 Under God 

712
00:50:57,563 --> 00:50:59,835
 Shall have a new 

713
00:50:59,871 --> 00:51:02,044
 Birth, freedom 

714
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:04,188
 And that government 

715
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:07,362
 Of the people 

716
00:51:07,399 --> 00:51:08,806
 By the people 

717
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:11,460
 For the people 

718
00:51:11,498 --> 00:51:15,146
 Shall not perish
from the earth 

719
00:51:17,424 --> 00:51:20,657
Corporal!
Corporal, are you all right?

720
00:51:24,569 --> 00:51:27,156
Your president is safe.

721
00:51:30,783 --> 00:51:32,728
Get up, you doped-up bastard!

722
00:51:32,770 --> 00:51:34,909
We got wounded gooks
on our hands!

723
00:52:35,333 --> 00:52:37,377
That's a girl.

724
00:52:37,417 --> 00:52:39,490
You're OK.

725
00:52:48,082 --> 00:52:49,611
Major?

726
00:52:49,653 --> 00:52:51,027
Yeah?

727
00:52:51,062 --> 00:52:53,237
- Signal, sir.
- Ahem. Come on in.

728
00:52:59,584 --> 00:53:01,690
- Want some coffee?
- Oh, thanks.

729
00:53:02,788 --> 00:53:04,250
OK, shoot.

730
00:53:04,293 --> 00:53:06,205
Uh...

731
00:53:06,248 --> 00:53:08,836
Mung Tau had a couple snipers
last night. That's all.

732
00:53:08,874 --> 00:53:10,565
Lieutenant What's-His-Face
moved Mung Tau...

733
00:53:10,603 --> 00:53:11,881
on down into the yellow.

734
00:53:11,917 --> 00:53:13,411
Red's in the clear now.

735
00:53:13,454 --> 00:53:15,280
I had a signal
from Lieutenant Hamilton...

736
00:53:15,313 --> 00:53:16,742
about that little action
over at Muc Wa last night...

737
00:53:16,786 --> 00:53:17,868
if you want me
to read it to you.

738
00:53:17,908 --> 00:53:19,600
Mmm. Go ahead.

739
00:53:19,638 --> 00:53:21,714
"From Operation Blaze
to Thunderhead.

740
00:53:21,753 --> 00:53:25,172
Sir, we have met the enemy,
and they are ours."

741
00:53:27,903 --> 00:53:30,426
You dirty rat.
You sneaked up on me.

742
00:53:30,466 --> 00:53:31,742
I don't believe it.

743
00:53:31,778 --> 00:53:34,204
Swear to God.
That's what he says.

744
00:53:34,246 --> 00:53:35,742
What else does it say?

745
00:53:35,784 --> 00:53:37,509
Uh, signal goes on to say...

746
00:53:37,546 --> 00:53:39,268
the attack consisted
of twelve rounds of mortar fire.

747
00:53:39,305 --> 00:53:41,732
There were two light casualties.

748
00:53:41,773 --> 00:53:43,882
Mortar was knocked out
by an ambush patrol...

749
00:53:43,921 --> 00:53:46,256
led by Corporal Courcey,
four Cong killed.

750
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:49,523
Courcey, huh? Hmm.

751
00:53:49,558 --> 00:53:51,895
So, the draftee
got himself bloody.

752
00:53:51,929 --> 00:53:53,784
Well, what do you know?

753
00:53:53,818 --> 00:53:56,539
Commend Hamilton, and tell him
to pass it on to the draftee.

754
00:53:56,574 --> 00:53:58,169
Yes, sir.

755
00:54:04,229 --> 00:54:06,336
Fucking draftee.

756
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:19,539
Hello, little girl.

757
00:54:30,243 --> 00:54:31,585
A-OK!

758
00:54:39,405 --> 00:54:41,194
What are you doin', corporal?

759
00:54:41,230 --> 00:54:43,568
I'm shortening fuses
to one second for the sergeant.

760
00:54:43,603 --> 00:54:45,096
Oh, yeah?

761
00:54:45,138 --> 00:54:46,384
Yeah.

762
00:54:46,421 --> 00:54:48,276
He's gonna plant grenades
in front of the barbed wire...

763
00:54:48,309 --> 00:54:50,168
with trip loops on 'em.

764
00:54:50,198 --> 00:54:51,410
How do you feel, sir?

765
00:54:51,449 --> 00:54:54,868
Oh, fine, corporal. I'm about
recovered from my bout.

766
00:54:56,256 --> 00:55:00,000
Corporal, that little girl's
standing out there in the rain.

767
00:55:00,033 --> 00:55:02,175
Well, what does she want?

768
00:55:02,213 --> 00:55:04,255
I think she wants me.

769
00:55:04,295 --> 00:55:07,048
You're joking.
She's just a child.

770
00:55:07,082 --> 00:55:09,701
Cowboy says she's fourteen.

771
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:11,882
Well, you're not going to,
corporal.

772
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,962
That's strictly
against the rules for us.

773
00:55:14,002 --> 00:55:16,907
No, sir. I'm not going to.

774
00:55:18,103 --> 00:55:20,953
Oh, sir.

775
00:55:20,985 --> 00:55:24,121
I finally got
those graves counted.

776
00:55:24,158 --> 00:55:25,652
Exactly three hundred and two.

777
00:55:27,168 --> 00:55:29,341
They were brave men, corporal.

778
00:55:29,377 --> 00:55:32,162
They fought the battle
and lost...

779
00:55:32,196 --> 00:55:34,622
but we won't lose.

780
00:55:34,663 --> 00:55:35,909
We're Americans.

781
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:58,972
I got a schedule, sir.

782
00:55:59,011 --> 00:56:01,664
I'm gonna pin my leaves on
before I'm twenty-eight.

783
00:56:01,701 --> 00:56:03,647
I'm gonna have my eagles
before I'm thirty-two.

784
00:56:03,688 --> 00:56:06,023
When I'm thirty-eight...

785
00:56:06,056 --> 00:56:07,522
I'm gonna have a star.

786
00:56:07,565 --> 00:56:10,088
Maybe two.

787
00:56:10,127 --> 00:56:14,057
General Alfred by-God Olivetti.
That's my schedule, sir.

788
00:56:14,097 --> 00:56:17,484
Very proper schedule, Al.
Very proper, indeed.

789
00:56:17,526 --> 00:56:19,383
Just like an express train.

790
00:56:19,415 --> 00:56:21,043
And you'll do it, too.

791
00:56:21,081 --> 00:56:22,742
You'll do it
because you got the...

792
00:56:22,781 --> 00:56:24,887
you got the coal,
and you got the steam.

793
00:56:25,984 --> 00:56:28,923
But watch out for
those fucking block signals.

794
00:56:28,964 --> 00:56:31,617
Well, how... how do you mean, sir?

795
00:56:31,654 --> 00:56:34,722
Well, did you ever
ask yourself, Al...

796
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:36,968
why after two wars
and a bucketful of medals...

797
00:56:37,004 --> 00:56:38,150
I'm still a major?

798
00:56:38,188 --> 00:56:41,060
Well, I wasn't gonna
ask that, sir.

799
00:56:41,103 --> 00:56:43,790
Booze and pudenda.

800
00:56:43,827 --> 00:56:45,139
Oh, I could handle the booze,
all right...

801
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:49,043
but it was the pudenda
that got me.

802
00:56:49,082 --> 00:56:50,905
I don't know that word, sir.

803
00:56:50,939 --> 00:56:53,558
Well, in politer circles,
I think they call it pussy.

804
00:56:53,597 --> 00:56:55,968
Don't laugh, son.

805
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,622
Listen, in the Pentagon,
there's a secret vault...

806
00:56:58,661 --> 00:57:00,766
and nobody has the key
but the chief of staff.

807
00:57:00,805 --> 00:57:02,813
He wears it around his neck.

808
00:57:02,855 --> 00:57:05,226
And in that vault is
a list of names of officers...

809
00:57:05,259 --> 00:57:07,301
who are not gentleman.

810
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:09,961
Now, any time an officer
comes up for promotion...

811
00:57:09,998 --> 00:57:13,350
the chief steals into that vault
and runs down the list.

812
00:57:13,394 --> 00:57:17,459
If the officer's name is
on that list, zap, no promotion.

813
00:57:17,496 --> 00:57:20,631
I'm on that list.
I'm not a gentleman.

814
00:57:21,787 --> 00:57:25,336
Oh, I was once, yes, but...

815
00:57:25,374 --> 00:57:26,588
there's a certain general...

816
00:57:26,627 --> 00:57:29,663
I won't tell you his name
or how many stars he wears...

817
00:57:29,701 --> 00:57:32,157
but I was his aide for a while,
right after moving up to major.

818
00:57:33,128 --> 00:57:34,506
And he had a wife...

819
00:57:34,539 --> 00:57:36,647
who was some twenty years
younger than he...

820
00:57:36,684 --> 00:57:37,832
and I guess
he wasn't up to snuff...

821
00:57:37,870 --> 00:57:39,397
in the conjugal department...

822
00:57:39,439 --> 00:57:42,825
because it wasn't long before
I found myself being groped.

823
00:57:42,868 --> 00:57:46,550
But I was a gentleman, Al,
and this was my general's lady.

824
00:57:46,583 --> 00:57:50,417
And I tried to be courteous and
remain upright at all times...

825
00:57:50,459 --> 00:57:53,812
but, shit, how long
can a fella remain upright...

826
00:57:53,856 --> 00:57:55,231
when he's being
crawled all over...

827
00:57:55,264 --> 00:57:57,632
every time the general goes out
to take a pee or something?

828
00:57:57,666 --> 00:57:59,295
Not long, right?

829
00:57:59,334 --> 00:58:03,875
Well, finally, I screwed her.
Big mistake, Al, big mistake.

830
00:58:03,912 --> 00:58:05,192
I thought
I'd cool her off some...

831
00:58:05,228 --> 00:58:07,116
but it turned out
that I got hooked.

832
00:58:07,149 --> 00:58:09,705
She was the hottest thing
I ever had in all my life.

833
00:58:09,745 --> 00:58:10,989
Wow.

834
00:58:11,026 --> 00:58:12,522
Thereafter, I found myself
humping her...

835
00:58:12,564 --> 00:58:15,982
on any and every occasion,
in all fashions known to man.

836
00:58:16,023 --> 00:58:18,841
Then one night
there was a big to-do...

837
00:58:18,875 --> 00:58:20,283
at an embassy in Washington...

838
00:58:20,315 --> 00:58:23,384
and I accompanied
the general and his lady.

839
00:58:23,423 --> 00:58:26,557
Very prestigious affair.
Even the president was there.

840
00:58:26,594 --> 00:58:27,741
And while the general
was brown-nosing...

841
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:29,058
around the president...

842
00:58:29,094 --> 00:58:31,617
the lady and I
slipped out into the garden.

843
00:58:31,656 --> 00:58:32,834
You know what a gazebo is?

844
00:58:32,873 --> 00:58:35,528
Well, it's a big bird-cage
piece of junk...

845
00:58:35,565 --> 00:58:38,952
that sits in gardens
covered with rose vines.

846
00:58:38,994 --> 00:58:42,258
The lady and I slipped quietly
into this dark little bower...

847
00:58:42,293 --> 00:58:43,471
and she sat
with her back to the door...

848
00:58:43,509 --> 00:58:44,590
while I remained standing...

849
00:58:44,629 --> 00:58:47,021
keeping a sharp lookout
all around...

850
00:58:47,064 --> 00:58:50,100
whereupon she proceeded
to make love to me, orally.

851
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:51,485
Well, as you well know...

852
00:58:51,518 --> 00:58:53,527
there comes a time
in the sexual encounter...

853
00:58:53,568 --> 00:58:56,221
when a fellow is apt to lose
interest in the surroundings...

854
00:58:56,258 --> 00:58:58,468
which is precisely
what I was guilty of doing...

855
00:58:58,503 --> 00:59:00,675
and when things
swam into focus...

856
00:59:00,712 --> 00:59:02,721
the first thing I saw
was the general...

857
00:59:02,762 --> 00:59:04,105
standing in the arch...

858
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:06,662
pink roses
all around his old gray head...

859
00:59:06,701 --> 00:59:08,296
and next to him
was the ambassador's wife...

860
00:59:08,335 --> 00:59:11,024
and you-know-who.

861
00:59:11,061 --> 00:59:12,139
The president?

862
00:59:12,179 --> 00:59:15,981
Of the United States, on a tour
of the embassy gardens.

863
00:59:16,023 --> 00:59:18,099
Jesus H. Christ.

864
00:59:18,139 --> 00:59:21,173
There are stronger words
for that situation, Al...

865
00:59:21,212 --> 00:59:24,532
like gee whiz and, oh, gosh,
and golly...

866
00:59:24,577 --> 00:59:25,986
because the lady,
with her back to the door...

867
00:59:26,018 --> 00:59:27,397
didn't know they were there...

868
00:59:27,429 --> 00:59:29,701
and she had not yet
ceased operations.

869
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:34,502
And that's why,
after all these years...

870
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:35,621
I'm still a major.

871
00:59:35,662 --> 00:59:37,451
What did you do?

872
00:59:37,486 --> 00:59:38,568
Do?

873
00:59:38,608 --> 00:59:40,105
When you saw 'em standing there.

874
00:59:40,147 --> 00:59:43,600
I did the only thing
I've ever been trained to do.

875
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:45,462
I saluted.

876
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:05,415
What the hell
are you doing in my office?

877
01:00:05,454 --> 01:00:08,142
Posting the incident flow
priority indicator, sir.

878
01:00:08,177 --> 01:00:09,259
At this hour
of the goddamn night?

879
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:11,473
I thought it was important, sir,
in Muc Wa.

880
01:00:13,238 --> 01:00:15,182
What the fuck is Muc Wa
doing in yellow?

881
01:00:15,224 --> 01:00:16,305
The parables, sir.

882
01:00:16,344 --> 01:00:18,387
Oh, screw the parables.
Muc Wa's nowhere.

883
01:00:18,428 --> 01:00:19,989
Cong don't give a shit
about Muc Wa.

884
01:00:20,029 --> 01:00:21,558
If you'll permit me
to explain, sir.

885
01:00:21,598 --> 01:00:23,162
You're just trying
to make trouble for me.

886
01:00:23,203 --> 01:00:24,446
You know that, God damn it.

887
01:00:24,482 --> 01:00:25,565
Sir, there's a definite...

888
01:00:25,605 --> 01:00:26,880
general converging
of incidents...

889
01:00:26,916 --> 01:00:28,326
toward the vicinity
of Muc Wa, sir.

890
01:00:32,522 --> 01:00:33,769
Oh, Christ.

891
01:00:33,806 --> 01:00:36,328
Get up off the goddamn floor.

892
01:00:42,711 --> 01:00:44,754
- Toffee!
- Present, sir.

893
01:00:44,794 --> 01:00:46,388
Get Muc Wa on the horn.

894
01:00:59,688 --> 01:01:00,936
Maybe they're asleep, sir.

895
01:01:00,972 --> 01:01:03,525
They can't afford to sleep.
Wake 'em up.

896
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:10,443
Oleo, come in, Oleo.
What's your situation?

897
01:01:10,486 --> 01:01:12,461
I got Cong on 2-7-2.

898
01:01:12,503 --> 01:01:15,026
I'm buggin' off before
they cut us off from the river.

899
01:01:15,065 --> 01:01:17,270
As soon as we hit the water
and clear the bank...

900
01:01:17,306 --> 01:01:19,165
tear the goddamn jungle up
behind us.

901
01:01:19,199 --> 01:01:20,628
Do you read me, Muc Wa? Over?

902
01:01:20,672 --> 01:01:22,332
5-5, Oleo, we'll cover.

903
01:01:22,369 --> 01:01:23,681
He's retreating
to the river, sir.

904
01:01:23,713 --> 01:01:25,144
He wants cover fire
to make the crossing.

905
01:01:25,188 --> 01:01:26,533
How can I do that?

906
01:01:26,567 --> 01:01:28,456
Cowboy, get me a fire team.

907
01:01:28,488 --> 01:01:30,212
Ackley, stay here
with the machine gun.

908
01:01:30,249 --> 01:01:31,494
Good, good! Sergeant Nguyen.

909
01:01:31,531 --> 01:01:33,062
Come on, Cowboy.

910
01:01:40,404 --> 01:01:42,448
Team one.

911
01:02:03,054 --> 01:02:04,431
I'll call it.

912
01:02:11,062 --> 01:02:13,301
They're right on my ass!
You better get cover!

913
01:02:13,336 --> 01:02:14,352
We got you!

914
01:02:18,207 --> 01:02:19,582
Here we come!

915
01:02:22,049 --> 01:02:23,459
Fire!

916
01:02:34,641 --> 01:02:36,911
- Blow the charge?
- No! Get the fire team back.

917
01:02:36,947 --> 01:02:38,059
They're comin' in now.

918
01:02:48,832 --> 01:02:50,937
Sergeant, sergeant.

919
01:02:50,976 --> 01:02:53,502
You left one of your men
out there.

920
01:02:53,540 --> 01:02:55,004
Well, Christ, lieutenant,
we wasn't lookin' back.

921
01:02:55,046 --> 01:02:57,569
- I'll get him in, sir.
- Damned if you will, Courcey.

922
01:02:57,608 --> 01:02:59,750
Charlie's zeroed in on him,
just waiting for a sucker.

923
01:02:59,787 --> 01:03:02,212
I'll get him myself, corporal,
but thank you for volunteering.

924
01:03:02,253 --> 01:03:03,598
Didn't you hear what I said?

925
01:03:03,632 --> 01:03:05,259
You're not in command here,
sergeant.

926
01:03:05,297 --> 01:03:06,542
You don't see
any of those gooks...

927
01:03:06,579 --> 01:03:07,660
running out there for him,
do you?

928
01:03:07,701 --> 01:03:09,228
God damn it,
he's their buddy, not ours!

929
01:03:09,270 --> 01:03:12,022
You will lay down an enfilade
fire, and I'll go out under it.

930
01:03:12,056 --> 01:03:13,945
Enfilade, defilade...
Charlie's like a mole...

931
01:03:13,978 --> 01:03:16,185
God damn it!
They're dug in by now!

932
01:03:16,221 --> 01:03:17,467
You better listen to me.

933
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:19,805
Carry out my order, sergeant.

934
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:21,250
He's crazy.

935
01:03:23,396 --> 01:03:24,959
Sir. Sir, listen.

936
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,041
He's stopped calling.
He's probably dead by now.

937
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:28,938
Don't you see I have
to go out there, Courcey?

938
01:03:28,972 --> 01:03:31,461
- Don't you see that?
- Sir! Sir.

939
01:03:31,501 --> 01:03:33,412
Cover him.

940
01:03:57,290 --> 01:04:00,326
OK, soldier, I'm here.
You'll be OK now.

941
01:04:46,302 --> 01:04:48,728
By God, Asa, I was right!

942
01:04:48,770 --> 01:04:50,198
They don't want us in Muc Wa.

943
01:04:50,241 --> 01:04:51,488
They don't want us
anywhere, sir.

944
01:04:51,525 --> 01:04:52,934
Asa, it's a key defense point.

945
01:04:52,967 --> 01:04:54,461
Look how quick
the Cong moved in.

946
01:04:54,503 --> 01:04:56,993
The Cong moved in because they
knew it was a weak point, sir.

947
01:04:59,374 --> 01:05:01,677
What's the reaction time
for your reinforcements?

948
01:05:01,711 --> 01:05:04,202
With luck I can get air support
in about thirty minutes.

949
01:05:04,241 --> 01:05:05,771
I'm not talking about
air support.

950
01:05:05,813 --> 01:05:07,670
I'm talking about infantry...
bodies, fella.

951
01:05:07,703 --> 01:05:08,782
How long does it take you...

952
01:05:08,823 --> 01:05:10,286
to get your reinforcements
in there?

953
01:05:10,329 --> 01:05:12,022
Two or three days, maybe.

954
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:14,428
Where the hell
are your reserves, Bangkok?

955
01:05:14,461 --> 01:05:15,543
Sir, I have to get
my reserves...

956
01:05:15,583 --> 01:05:17,341
from the province chief,
Colonel Minh.

957
01:05:17,377 --> 01:05:18,622
Colonel Lard-ass Minh.

958
01:05:18,658 --> 01:05:20,318
Well, ask him
to be ready to move.

959
01:05:20,357 --> 01:05:21,765
I have to make a deal
with him, sir.

960
01:05:21,797 --> 01:05:23,654
He don't lend support
for nothing.

961
01:05:23,688 --> 01:05:25,446
Christ!

962
01:05:25,483 --> 01:05:27,524
We're trying to help
these people fight the reds...

963
01:05:27,564 --> 01:05:29,868
and they throw blocks into us.

964
01:05:29,902 --> 01:05:31,081
The only way
we're gonna win this war...

965
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:33,708
is to get United States
combat troops in here.

966
01:05:33,746 --> 01:05:34,893
All right, you do
what you have to do...

967
01:05:34,932 --> 01:05:36,973
to get those reserves
and beef up Muc Wa.

968
01:05:40,058 --> 01:05:41,367
By God, we can't let those...

969
01:05:41,403 --> 01:05:42,648
scroungy little
jungle buggers...

970
01:05:42,683 --> 01:05:46,332
chase the American
Advisory Command off a post.

971
01:05:46,369 --> 01:05:47,646
Can we?

972
01:06:22,473 --> 01:06:23,966
Sergeant?

973
01:06:24,008 --> 01:06:26,467
We're ready to bury
the lieutenant, sir.

974
01:06:29,552 --> 01:06:30,664
Sir?

975
01:06:33,617 --> 01:06:34,797
We're ready.

976
01:06:38,808 --> 01:06:40,915
We're gonna bury the lieutenant.

977
01:06:43,325 --> 01:06:45,534
Dumb jerk-off.

978
01:06:45,568 --> 01:06:46,998
We can't just
shovel dirt on him.

979
01:06:47,042 --> 01:06:48,571
You've buried men before.

980
01:06:48,613 --> 01:06:51,462
You know what to say
and what to do...

981
01:06:51,495 --> 01:06:52,869
and you're in command now.

982
01:06:52,903 --> 01:06:54,280
Shit on it.

983
01:06:56,299 --> 01:06:57,763
What's the matter with you?

984
01:06:59,533 --> 01:07:02,922
Look, you owe it
to the lieutenant to honor him.

985
01:07:02,963 --> 01:07:05,234
The man he was trying to save
was in your squad.

986
01:07:05,270 --> 01:07:08,439
You left him
out there in the mud.

987
01:07:08,473 --> 01:07:10,680
He was a dink.

988
01:07:10,716 --> 01:07:14,943
I'm sick and tired of
the goddamn fish-stinkin' dinks.

989
01:07:17,378 --> 01:07:19,005
Courcey, I was soldiering...

990
01:07:19,044 --> 01:07:20,869
when you were crapping
in your diapers.

991
01:07:20,904 --> 01:07:22,530
Don't you tell me
how to do my job!

992
01:07:22,569 --> 01:07:23,878
Get the fuck out of here!

993
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:27,181
Sarge...

994
01:07:28,174 --> 01:07:30,544
Leave me be, kid.

995
01:07:30,577 --> 01:07:32,619
I've had it.

996
01:08:26,031 --> 01:08:27,973
When did you take this?

997
01:08:28,015 --> 01:08:30,953
About a half hour ago, I guess.

998
01:08:32,821 --> 01:08:34,230
Yeah?

999
01:08:46,403 --> 01:08:47,582
OK.

1000
01:08:48,805 --> 01:08:50,401
You still want that C.I. B?

1001
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:51,850
You're the new commander
at Muc Wa.

1002
01:08:51,882 --> 01:08:54,536
Chopper's taking you in.
Take a look at this.

1003
01:08:56,206 --> 01:08:59,374
If they hit, they'll hit from
the north and from the west.

1004
01:08:59,409 --> 01:09:02,094
Concentrate your defense
on those two fronts.

1005
01:09:02,131 --> 01:09:03,542
Yeah.

1006
01:09:03,576 --> 01:09:05,135
Right. Yes, sir.

1007
01:09:05,175 --> 01:09:07,218
I'll get my gear together.

1008
01:09:07,258 --> 01:09:08,337
Oh...

1009
01:09:09,661 --> 01:09:12,981
I read the signal on Oleo, sir.

1010
01:09:13,024 --> 01:09:15,678
It's too bad him
going off his rocker like that.

1011
01:09:15,715 --> 01:09:17,693
Two-bit war wasn't worth it.

1012
01:09:17,735 --> 01:09:18,979
Or that kid Hamilton.

1013
01:09:21,481 --> 01:09:22,858
Al...

1014
01:09:22,892 --> 01:09:25,742
If I can't wangle reinforcements
out of Colonel Lard-ass...

1015
01:09:25,775 --> 01:09:27,815
you bug out of there
at your own discretion.

1016
01:09:27,856 --> 01:09:28,937
Run like hell.

1017
01:09:28,977 --> 01:09:30,059
It'd be
the end of my career, sir.

1018
01:09:30,099 --> 01:09:31,179
Harnitz would see to that.

1019
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:32,596
I'll take care of Harnitz.

1020
01:09:32,629 --> 01:09:34,869
Just don't be a hero.

1021
01:09:46,597 --> 01:09:48,158
<i>Comment allez-vous, major?</i>

1022
01:09:48,199 --> 01:09:51,050
- Very well, thank you.
- Ah.

1023
01:09:51,083 --> 01:09:52,164
A drink?

1024
01:09:52,202 --> 01:09:53,446
- Always.
- Ah.

1025
01:10:02,294 --> 01:10:04,533
To the U.S. Of A.

1026
01:10:04,568 --> 01:10:05,999
I thank you.

1027
01:10:10,622 --> 01:10:12,513
To the Republic
of South Vietnam.

1028
01:10:12,546 --> 01:10:15,100
<i>Ah, merci. Merci beaucoup.</i>

1029
01:10:17,669 --> 01:10:19,559
Please, sit.

1030
01:10:19,592 --> 01:10:21,253
Thank you.

1031
01:10:21,290 --> 01:10:24,293
The colonel
has considered your request...

1032
01:10:24,334 --> 01:10:26,475
for three hundred
additional troops...

1033
01:10:26,512 --> 01:10:29,744
but at this time,
it is not possible.

1034
01:10:29,780 --> 01:10:32,629
There is rumor of a coup
in Saigon.

1035
01:10:32,662 --> 01:10:35,448
The colonel must hold all
of his troops in readiness...

1036
01:10:35,482 --> 01:10:38,072
for support of the president.

1037
01:10:38,110 --> 01:10:40,413
I appreciate
the colonel's situation.

1038
01:10:43,074 --> 01:10:45,530
But I need reinforcements
for a place called Muc Wa.

1039
01:10:49,642 --> 01:10:50,887
Before the colonel makes...

1040
01:10:50,923 --> 01:10:53,349
an absolutely final decision,
let me add this.

1041
01:10:56,177 --> 01:10:58,283
A relief column going into
Muc Wa would need artillery.

1042
01:11:00,278 --> 01:11:01,652
Now, the American
Advisory Command...

1043
01:11:01,686 --> 01:11:03,664
has no artillery
in this province.

1044
01:11:05,305 --> 01:11:07,894
But Colonel Minh has. Allow me.

1045
01:11:10,208 --> 01:11:14,752
The colonel has a battery
of howitzers situated here...

1046
01:11:17,381 --> 01:11:20,104
to protect the old road from
the south going into Penang.

1047
01:11:22,412 --> 01:11:25,416
If that battery were moved
thirty miles to the east...

1048
01:11:25,457 --> 01:11:27,115
on the road to Phnom Penh...

1049
01:11:29,301 --> 01:11:31,244
They would be within range
of Muc Wa.

1050
01:11:33,147 --> 01:11:34,707
Now, I realize
that the colonel...

1051
01:11:34,747 --> 01:11:36,787
would be using
precious ammunition...

1052
01:11:36,826 --> 01:11:39,320
on a rather unimportant post.

1053
01:11:40,672 --> 01:11:44,419
But if the colonel
could spare the troops I need...

1054
01:11:45,895 --> 01:11:48,417
I will have five hundred rounds
of howitzer shells...

1055
01:11:48,456 --> 01:11:49,952
brought in by air transport...

1056
01:11:52,684 --> 01:11:55,504
And a thousand rounds
delivered by truck convoy.

1057
01:12:04,635 --> 01:12:08,501
It would take four or five days
for the truck convoy...

1058
01:12:08,543 --> 01:12:11,066
to bring the shells
from the American depot.

1059
01:12:11,104 --> 01:12:13,955
That could conceivably be
too late for their use...

1060
01:12:13,988 --> 01:12:15,713
could it not, major?

1061
01:12:16,968 --> 01:12:18,213
Could be.

1062
01:12:24,177 --> 01:12:27,979
In such a case, the American
depot would desire...

1063
01:12:28,022 --> 01:12:30,838
the return of the shells,
would it not?

1064
01:12:32,345 --> 01:12:34,234
In the whole history
of the United States...

1065
01:12:34,267 --> 01:12:36,123
they've never asked
for the return of anything...

1066
01:12:36,156 --> 01:12:39,674
be it guns, money, boats,
or howitzer shells.

1067
01:12:39,713 --> 01:12:42,398
They wouldn't know how to ask
for the return of anything.

1068
01:12:42,435 --> 01:12:44,740
If they did, it would screw up
the bookkeeping...

1069
01:12:44,774 --> 01:12:45,986
and everybody in Washington...

1070
01:12:46,024 --> 01:12:48,327
would have
a goddamn nervous breakdown.

1071
01:12:48,362 --> 01:12:49,509
You tell the colonel...

1072
01:12:49,548 --> 01:12:52,899
if he gets his hands
on the ammo, it's his forever.

1073
01:13:09,826 --> 01:13:11,419
A drink?

1074
01:13:12,323 --> 01:13:14,016
Always.

1075
01:13:21,871 --> 01:13:23,881
Alemay akefay.

1076
01:13:25,170 --> 01:13:26,796
I do not understand.

1077
01:13:26,834 --> 01:13:29,360
It's an old battle cry
from our American revolution.

1078
01:13:29,399 --> 01:13:31,637
It means, "To victory."

1079
01:13:37,247 --> 01:13:39,901
<i>Merci. Merci.</i>

1080
01:14:21,937 --> 01:14:24,555
- You got anything from Courcey?
- No, sir.

1081
01:14:34,718 --> 01:14:36,312
Ackley.

1082
01:14:36,352 --> 01:14:38,044
Read me. Over.

1083
01:14:39,491 --> 01:14:42,658
Ackley, read me.
I got Charlie. Stand by.

1084
01:14:42,694 --> 01:14:44,101
5-5, Courcey, over.

1085
01:14:48,140 --> 01:14:49,386
Charlie's got
a big team out here...

1086
01:14:49,422 --> 01:14:51,145
moving west along the river.

1087
01:14:51,183 --> 01:14:52,462
Roger, Courcey, stand by.

1088
01:14:52,497 --> 01:14:53,743
We're gonna get hit.

1089
01:14:53,778 --> 01:14:56,335
Maybe a couple hundred VC,
and they got hardware.

1090
01:14:56,374 --> 01:14:57,935
We'll be ready for 'em.

1091
01:14:57,973 --> 01:15:00,148
You tell Courcey
to dog 'em long enough...

1092
01:15:00,186 --> 01:15:01,267
to see if
they get across the river...

1093
01:15:01,305 --> 01:15:03,062
then get his ass back in here.

1094
01:15:03,099 --> 01:15:04,181
Shoot a signal off to Penang...

1095
01:15:04,220 --> 01:15:06,591
tell them we want flare ships
and air support on standby.

1096
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:08,186
Cowboy, get outside
and shake the farmers down.

1097
01:15:08,227 --> 01:15:09,341
Yes, sir.

1098
01:15:14,633 --> 01:15:16,062
Charlie's crossing the river.

1099
01:15:16,106 --> 01:15:18,664
Now he's within mortar range.
You want to try a hit? Over.

1100
01:15:18,703 --> 01:15:19,783
Hell, yes, let's try it.

1101
01:15:19,822 --> 01:15:21,252
Let the bastards know
were onto 'em.

1102
01:15:21,296 --> 01:15:22,703
Give me the range and direction.

1103
01:15:22,737 --> 01:15:24,301
On the map, he's crossing...

1104
01:15:24,340 --> 01:15:26,863
in the middle of the third bend
above the fork.

1105
01:15:26,901 --> 01:15:28,628
Set your range
for two thousand yards.

1106
01:15:28,666 --> 01:15:31,189
I'll talk you on target
after the first round.

1107
01:15:31,227 --> 01:15:33,236
Signal when
you're ready to fire. Over.

1108
01:15:33,277 --> 01:15:35,645
When we get the range,
get out of there, Courcey.

1109
01:15:35,679 --> 01:15:36,761
They'll know
they're being observed...

1110
01:15:36,801 --> 01:15:38,558
and they're gonna be
on your butt, boy.

1111
01:15:38,594 --> 01:15:40,320
Stand by. Out.

1112
01:15:43,849 --> 01:15:45,760
Drop it.

1113
01:15:52,818 --> 01:15:55,538
Take it down two hundred.
Spray left and right for effect.

1114
01:15:55,574 --> 01:15:57,845
Drop two hundred, fire
left and right for effect.

1115
01:16:08,964 --> 01:16:10,308
I'm buggin' out.

1116
01:16:45,804 --> 01:16:46,917
There he is.

1117
01:16:50,609 --> 01:16:52,499
Major! Sir!

1118
01:16:52,532 --> 01:16:53,808
God damn it, Wattsberg...

1119
01:16:53,845 --> 01:16:55,856
every time I see you
it means bad news.

1120
01:16:55,894 --> 01:16:57,140
What the hell is it now?

1121
01:16:57,177 --> 01:16:59,381
Sir, Muc Wa is in the red, sir.

1122
01:16:59,417 --> 01:17:01,242
Captain Olivetti's
requested flare ships...

1123
01:17:01,277 --> 01:17:03,134
and air support on standby.

1124
01:17:03,167 --> 01:17:05,622
Intelligence reports
that the 507th VC battalion...

1125
01:17:05,664 --> 01:17:07,577
may be closing on Muc Wa, sir.

1126
01:17:07,620 --> 01:17:09,082
Is that all?

1127
01:17:09,124 --> 01:17:11,134
I'll bet you got
some more goodies for me.

1128
01:17:11,176 --> 01:17:12,223
Yes, sir.

1129
01:17:12,263 --> 01:17:15,084
Nighthawk control reports they
can't send up flare ships...

1130
01:17:15,118 --> 01:17:17,539
because General Harnitz
has grounded all helicopters...

1131
01:17:17,582 --> 01:17:19,689
and planes on request
of the Saigon government.

1132
01:17:19,728 --> 01:17:21,737
An attempted military coup
is expected, sir...

1133
01:17:21,778 --> 01:17:23,340
and all our air support
is gonna be needed...

1134
01:17:23,381 --> 01:17:26,350
to suppress the insurgents
in Saigon, sir.

1135
01:17:28,730 --> 01:17:30,707
You can turn in now, boys.

1136
01:17:32,605 --> 01:17:33,819
What are you going to do, sir?

1137
01:17:33,857 --> 01:17:36,345
Don't worry about it.
I'll think of something.

1138
01:17:45,132 --> 01:17:47,589
What's going on?

1139
01:17:47,629 --> 01:17:49,356
I just keep hammering
for air support, sir...

1140
01:17:49,393 --> 01:17:52,593
but Nighthawk just keeps saying,
"Negative, negative, negative."

1141
01:17:54,357 --> 01:17:55,789
Let me have the key, Toffee.

1142
01:18:03,104 --> 01:18:05,047
What's General Harnitz's
call numbers?

1143
01:18:05,089 --> 01:18:06,751
F-F-Z-T.

1144
01:18:06,788 --> 01:18:08,033
This is the code book, sir.

1145
01:18:08,069 --> 01:18:09,380
Fuck it.

1146
01:18:44,588 --> 01:18:45,767
Look.

1147
01:19:23,736 --> 01:19:25,427
Let's go in here.

1148
01:19:30,656 --> 01:19:31,965
Well, it's shocking, sir.

1149
01:19:32,001 --> 01:19:33,343
It's unthinkable
that any officer...

1150
01:19:33,378 --> 01:19:36,349
would address such a message
to his commanding general.

1151
01:19:36,390 --> 01:19:39,588
What would you like
to do about it, sir?

1152
01:19:39,624 --> 01:19:41,666
Sir?

1153
01:19:41,706 --> 01:19:44,558
Captain, there are things in
heaven and earth and the army...

1154
01:19:44,591 --> 01:19:47,276
they didn't teach you
at Virginia Military Institute.

1155
01:19:47,311 --> 01:19:49,388
This here is one.

1156
01:19:49,428 --> 01:19:53,208
There are some soldiers who
bought the rap with their blood.

1157
01:19:53,241 --> 01:19:56,820
They'll say anything to anybody
in a just cause.

1158
01:19:56,858 --> 01:19:58,934
Now, military coup
or no military coup...

1159
01:19:58,974 --> 01:20:01,496
you hop-ass over
to the combo room...

1160
01:20:01,537 --> 01:20:03,578
and fire off a signal
to Nighthawk control...

1161
01:20:03,619 --> 01:20:05,629
to put some air support
over Muc Wa.

1162
01:20:05,669 --> 01:20:06,749
Yes, sir.

1163
01:20:06,789 --> 01:20:09,064
'Cause apart from the fact
that maybe I got old Asa...

1164
01:20:09,099 --> 01:20:10,592
stretched pretty thin
up there...

1165
01:20:10,634 --> 01:20:14,730
that crazy son of a bitch might
just do what he says here...

1166
01:20:14,766 --> 01:20:16,328
shoot my balls off.

1167
01:20:34,180 --> 01:20:36,450
What do you think
I'm here for, Courcey?

1168
01:20:37,864 --> 01:20:39,360
Move over.

1169
01:20:41,706 --> 01:20:44,394
Will you sit down
on that box over there?

1170
01:20:44,431 --> 01:20:45,544
You're beat.

1171
01:20:53,497 --> 01:20:57,626
Been shot through the flesh.
Lucky. Hasn't lost much blood.

1172
01:20:57,662 --> 01:20:59,224
These little mothers are tough.

1173
01:20:59,264 --> 01:21:01,305
You can't believe
what I've seen 'em take...

1174
01:21:01,345 --> 01:21:03,288
and get up and trot
the next day.

1175
01:21:03,330 --> 01:21:06,401
You can't worry about 'em,
Courcey.

1176
01:21:06,438 --> 01:21:09,289
You better learn that.
You better get hard.

1177
01:21:09,322 --> 01:21:11,528
They don't know
what you're doin' here...

1178
01:21:11,564 --> 01:21:13,290
or what they're doin' here.

1179
01:21:13,327 --> 01:21:15,217
There.

1180
01:21:15,249 --> 01:21:18,100
Slopes out there shot him...

1181
01:21:18,133 --> 01:21:20,555
they don't know any more
than he does.

1182
01:21:22,134 --> 01:21:26,331
They could change places
and not know the difference.

1183
01:21:37,704 --> 01:21:40,228
A-OK, old man.

1184
01:21:42,543 --> 01:21:43,656
A-OK.

1185
01:21:44,881 --> 01:21:48,496
A... OK.

1186
01:21:48,532 --> 01:21:51,438
A... A...

1187
01:22:00,353 --> 01:22:03,138
Nighthawk to Blaze.
Nighthawk to Blaze. Over.

1188
01:22:03,172 --> 01:22:04,353
Got 'em, sir.

1189
01:22:04,391 --> 01:22:05,984
Blaze to Nighthawk.

1190
01:22:06,023 --> 01:22:08,743
What's your position,
and what do you got? Over.

1191
01:22:09,963 --> 01:22:13,034
Nighthawk to Blaze. One flare
ship and two hawks in group.

1192
01:22:13,071 --> 01:22:15,527
Position maybe ten miles
due east of you...

1193
01:22:15,568 --> 01:22:17,940
but a star shell
will help confirm. Over.

1194
01:22:17,973 --> 01:22:19,216
You got it, baby.

1195
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:33,148
Nighthawk to Blaze. We see you.
Closer than we thought.

1196
01:22:33,190 --> 01:22:34,946
OK. Let's go.

1197
01:22:47,285 --> 01:22:48,812
OK, they got it.

1198
01:22:51,706 --> 01:22:52,917
Hey, they got it, major!

1199
01:22:52,955 --> 01:22:56,188
Hey, major, they got it.

1200
01:22:58,144 --> 01:23:00,348
Hey, major,
they got the air support.

1201
01:23:00,385 --> 01:23:03,040
Marvelous, sir. You did it, sir!

1202
01:23:03,078 --> 01:23:04,803
Yeah, well...

1203
01:23:04,839 --> 01:23:07,592
me and old Harnitz,
we go back a long way.

1204
01:23:15,347 --> 01:23:17,684
Blaze to Nighthawk!
You got us. Over.

1205
01:23:18,774 --> 01:23:21,144
We got you, Blaze. Over.

1206
01:23:21,177 --> 01:23:22,424
Then light us up!

1207
01:23:22,459 --> 01:23:25,144
Hit the goddamn treeline on
the west side of the triangle!

1208
01:23:25,181 --> 01:23:26,972
Hit the wall, Ackley!

1209
01:24:35,241 --> 01:24:38,759
Courcey! Cowboy! The north gate!

1210
01:24:38,797 --> 01:24:40,520
A couple of the bastards
are trying an end run!

1211
01:25:19,385 --> 01:25:22,868
That's the way the USA
kicks ass, Charlie!

1212
01:25:22,908 --> 01:25:25,561
That's the way
I get my goddamn C.I.B.

1213
01:26:03,819 --> 01:26:06,438
Wattsberg, what the fuck are you
doing out here in a chopper?

1214
01:26:06,477 --> 01:26:08,267
I requested it
in your name, sir.

1215
01:26:08,303 --> 01:26:10,576
- Sir, I have...
- You requested it in my name?

1216
01:26:10,610 --> 01:26:12,880
Soldier, shoot
this goddamn four-eyed nitwit.

1217
01:26:12,916 --> 01:26:15,089
Sir, the uniform code
of military justice...

1218
01:26:15,124 --> 01:26:17,266
expressly forbids
summary executions.

1219
01:26:17,304 --> 01:26:18,418
Oh, shit, Wattsberg,
what do you got?

1220
01:26:18,456 --> 01:26:19,604
This message, sir.

1221
01:26:19,643 --> 01:26:22,034
"Intelligence believes that
more than one thousand VC...

1222
01:26:22,077 --> 01:26:24,151
"are being moved
into the attack on Muc Wa.

1223
01:26:24,192 --> 01:26:25,917
"General Harnitz signals
he will not...

1224
01:26:25,954 --> 01:26:28,377
"repeat, he will not commit
additional personnel...

1225
01:26:28,420 --> 01:26:29,985
"to the defense of Muc Wa.

1226
01:26:30,021 --> 01:26:31,681
"Its strategic value
is not now believed...

1227
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:33,893
"to be worth a major engagement
with the enemy.

1228
01:26:33,928 --> 01:26:35,820
"Immediately exfiltrate
all American personnel...

1229
01:26:35,853 --> 01:26:38,188
by aircraft
and disperse garrison."

1230
01:26:38,222 --> 01:26:39,600
Here. Give me that.

1231
01:26:41,619 --> 01:26:44,655
Sir, shall I take the helicopter
into Muc Wa?

1232
01:26:44,693 --> 01:26:47,566
I ought to let you.
Maybe you'd get yourself shot.

1233
01:26:47,609 --> 01:26:49,553
I want you to take the convoy
back to Penang.

1234
01:26:49,595 --> 01:26:51,353
I'll radio Olivetti
from the chopper...

1235
01:26:51,390 --> 01:26:53,213
that we're coming in
to exfiltrate the team.

1236
01:26:53,247 --> 01:26:55,355
I want 'em ready to go
the minute we touch down.

1237
01:26:55,395 --> 01:26:56,507
Understood.

1238
01:26:58,469 --> 01:27:00,838
Be careful, sir!

1239
01:27:00,871 --> 01:27:04,420
Wattsberg, do you love
your commanding officer?

1240
01:27:04,459 --> 01:27:07,179
Well... yes, sir.

1241
01:27:07,214 --> 01:27:09,900
That's fine,
because I love you, too.

1242
01:27:38,384 --> 01:27:39,597
Sir.

1243
01:27:43,284 --> 01:27:45,426
My men, they say they ride
in helicopter to Penang.

1244
01:27:45,464 --> 01:27:46,545
They're gonna do
what they're paid to do.

1245
01:27:46,585 --> 01:27:48,148
They're gonna help these farmers
bug out of here tonight...

1246
01:27:48,187 --> 01:27:49,269
and you're gonna be in command.

1247
01:27:49,308 --> 01:27:52,126
Sir, I am interpreter...
number one interpreter.

1248
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:53,273
I go with you.

1249
01:27:53,313 --> 01:27:54,876
You can interpret, all right.
You tell 'em...

1250
01:27:54,914 --> 01:27:56,345
they set one goddamn foot
toward that chopper...

1251
01:27:56,388 --> 01:27:57,916
and the machine gunner'll
cut 'em in half.

1252
01:27:57,958 --> 01:27:59,848
I hear it, sir.

1253
01:27:59,881 --> 01:28:02,731
They're getting ground fire.
Git!

1254
01:28:42,966 --> 01:28:44,048
What do we got here?

1255
01:28:44,088 --> 01:28:46,391
We got two on stretchers
and five walking wounded.

1256
01:28:46,426 --> 01:28:47,802
God damn it, Cowboy!

1257
01:28:47,835 --> 01:28:50,041
Tell 'em to stay back!
Tell 'em now!

1258
01:28:51,809 --> 01:28:53,597
Tell 'em, Cowboy.

1259
01:29:04,624 --> 01:29:06,894
That Courcey sure has a way
with the goddamn gooks, sir.

1260
01:29:06,928 --> 01:29:08,684
Let's get out of here
before he loses that way...

1261
01:29:08,721 --> 01:29:09,836
and they swamp the chopper.

1262
01:29:09,876 --> 01:29:11,222
Get the wounded aboard.

1263
01:29:19,454 --> 01:29:21,846
Come on!
Keep it moving! Keep it moving!

1264
01:29:21,889 --> 01:29:22,970
All right. Let's go.

1265
01:29:23,010 --> 01:29:24,092
We got a hit
in the hydraulic line.

1266
01:29:24,131 --> 01:29:25,212
We've got to leave
these walking wounded behind...

1267
01:29:25,253 --> 01:29:27,078
or I'll never get this heap
off the ground.

1268
01:29:27,112 --> 01:29:29,120
OK, OK. I got you.
No, back, back.

1269
01:29:29,162 --> 01:29:31,651
Move back. Come on, back.
Get away from the ship.

1270
01:29:31,692 --> 01:29:33,320
Sorry. Sorry.

1271
01:29:33,358 --> 01:29:35,213
Pilot says no.
We can't handle it.

1272
01:29:35,246 --> 01:29:37,288
Just not enough room
for all of you.

1273
01:29:37,329 --> 01:29:39,700
Now get back. Get back.
Come on, move.

1274
01:29:39,733 --> 01:29:41,162
Sorry. Sorry.

1275
01:29:41,206 --> 01:29:44,209
Sir, are you gonna leave
these wounded soldiers behind?

1276
01:29:44,248 --> 01:29:46,740
Pilot can't handle it. He runs
the ship. Now get aboard.

1277
01:29:46,777 --> 01:29:48,637
- No.
- What?

1278
01:29:48,670 --> 01:29:49,981
I said no, sir.

1279
01:29:51,905 --> 01:29:53,085
Corporal!

1280
01:29:57,223 --> 01:29:59,843
My orders are to exfiltrate
all American personnel.

1281
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:02,438
Now get aboard that ship.

1282
01:30:02,478 --> 01:30:05,032
Look, boy, it's their war,
and it's their country.

1283
01:30:05,071 --> 01:30:06,731
We've done all we can do here.

1284
01:30:06,769 --> 01:30:08,396
They're gonna
rip this place off.

1285
01:30:08,434 --> 01:30:09,777
Hey, major!
Come on, for Christ sake!

1286
01:30:09,812 --> 01:30:10,959
I got to get it up.

1287
01:30:10,999 --> 01:30:13,456
I'm giving you an order,
soldier.

1288
01:30:13,496 --> 01:30:14,840
Get your ass on that ship!

1289
01:30:17,084 --> 01:30:19,092
Take it up, God damn it.
Come on, major.

1290
01:30:23,939 --> 01:30:25,251
Get back. Get back.

1291
01:31:06,482 --> 01:31:09,420
Now I know what's
peculiar about you, Courcey.

1292
01:31:09,462 --> 01:31:10,705
I should have figured it
right off.

1293
01:31:10,741 --> 01:31:13,397
You got it written
in great big letters...

1294
01:31:13,435 --> 01:31:15,956
on your goddamn forehead...
h-e-r-o. Hero.

1295
01:31:15,996 --> 01:31:17,557
You're a fucking hero.

1296
01:31:17,597 --> 01:31:18,712
I'm sorry, sir.

1297
01:31:18,751 --> 01:31:21,142
I just didn't see how we could
leave these people behind.

1298
01:31:21,186 --> 01:31:22,333
We brought 'em out here.

1299
01:31:28,041 --> 01:31:29,899
How'd they do
in the fracas last night?

1300
01:31:29,932 --> 01:31:31,339
Fine, sir.

1301
01:31:33,105 --> 01:31:34,927
This character still
getting his jollies...

1302
01:31:34,962 --> 01:31:36,044
out of torturing dinks?

1303
01:31:36,084 --> 01:31:37,940
Couldn't have done it
without him, sir.

1304
01:31:39,957 --> 01:31:41,521
You screwing this kid?

1305
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:42,675
No, sir.

1306
01:31:42,715 --> 01:31:45,817
Well, if we're gonna
break out of here tonight...

1307
01:31:45,854 --> 01:31:47,830
we'd better start planning it.

1308
01:31:49,249 --> 01:31:50,810
The aerial photographs show...

1309
01:31:50,851 --> 01:31:53,439
that this... this gully runs
back here about half a mile...

1310
01:31:53,477 --> 01:31:54,756
then flattens out into a meadow.

1311
01:31:54,791 --> 01:31:55,870
- You know it?
- Yes, sir.

1312
01:31:55,910 --> 01:31:56,992
That's the way we'll go.

1313
01:31:57,031 --> 01:31:59,653
The province chief's
got a bunch of 155 howitzers...

1314
01:31:59,692 --> 01:32:01,799
ready to blow hell out of
this neck of the woods tonight...

1315
01:32:01,838 --> 01:32:03,881
if I can get the son of a bitch
to use his ammo.

1316
01:32:03,921 --> 01:32:06,476
Charlie be too busy ducking
shells to worry about us.

1317
01:32:08,149 --> 01:32:09,808
You sure you're not
screwing this kid?

1318
01:32:09,846 --> 01:32:11,573
Yes, sir.

1319
01:32:11,610 --> 01:32:12,722
Somebody ought to.

1320
01:32:12,762 --> 01:32:15,130
Bring 'em along, Cowboy.

1321
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:32,817
That is all, sir.

1322
01:32:32,849 --> 01:32:34,604
You're sure?

1323
01:32:34,641 --> 01:32:35,920
I don't want to leave
one goddamn thing...

1324
01:32:35,955 --> 01:32:37,070
that Charlie can use.

1325
01:32:37,109 --> 01:32:38,058
<i>Certainement.</i>

1326
01:32:38,101 --> 01:32:40,142
- You spike the mortars?
- Yes, sir.

1327
01:32:40,183 --> 01:32:43,417
Well, spike the machine guns
5 minutes before we shove off.

1328
01:32:43,453 --> 01:32:44,565
OK, Cowboy.

1329
01:32:52,228 --> 01:32:54,018
You seem to know
what you're doing.

1330
01:32:54,054 --> 01:32:55,845
I was trained
in demolition, sir.

1331
01:32:55,881 --> 01:32:57,442
So you said.

1332
01:32:57,482 --> 01:32:59,011
How about it, corporal?

1333
01:32:59,051 --> 01:33:00,647
How about what, sir?

1334
01:33:00,685 --> 01:33:02,215
What the fuck
are you doing in 'Nam?

1335
01:33:02,257 --> 01:33:04,430
Does it bother you, sir?

1336
01:33:04,466 --> 01:33:06,509
Well, now, it doesn't
bother me to the extent...

1337
01:33:06,550 --> 01:33:08,076
that I can't live
without knowing...

1338
01:33:08,117 --> 01:33:10,423
but we don't get
many draftees here.

1339
01:33:10,457 --> 01:33:11,538
Not yet, anyway.

1340
01:33:11,578 --> 01:33:14,778
And in particular,
we don't get any of your kind.

1341
01:33:14,814 --> 01:33:16,955
Well, sir...

1342
01:33:16,993 --> 01:33:19,232
it started with a dog.

1343
01:33:19,267 --> 01:33:20,380
You mean a broad?

1344
01:33:20,420 --> 01:33:21,949
No, canine, sir.

1345
01:33:22,917 --> 01:33:26,664
Just a little black dog
with a curly tail.

1346
01:33:26,698 --> 01:33:28,326
We used to tie him
in the furnace room...

1347
01:33:28,365 --> 01:33:29,773
during inspection time...

1348
01:33:29,805 --> 01:33:34,514
but he got loose this one time
and trotted in the barracks...

1349
01:33:34,547 --> 01:33:38,381
and took a liking,
or disliking maybe...

1350
01:33:38,424 --> 01:33:39,568
to the inspecting officer.

1351
01:33:39,606 --> 01:33:40,984
Went on his boot.

1352
01:33:41,019 --> 01:33:45,659
The officer kicked the dog,
and I kicked the officer.

1353
01:33:45,694 --> 01:33:47,388
You kicked the officer?

1354
01:33:47,426 --> 01:33:49,499
It was just a reflex, sir.

1355
01:33:49,539 --> 01:33:51,878
He was pretty nice about it,
really.

1356
01:33:51,909 --> 01:33:54,850
He could have court-martialed me
or sent me to prison.

1357
01:33:54,890 --> 01:33:58,210
He gave me a choice... Vietnam.

1358
01:33:58,254 --> 01:34:00,012
Very generous.

1359
01:34:00,046 --> 01:34:01,836
Very generous indeed.

1360
01:34:01,871 --> 01:34:04,593
What was the officer's rank?

1361
01:34:04,629 --> 01:34:06,057
Sir?

1362
01:34:06,101 --> 01:34:07,992
The officer's rank, corporal?

1363
01:34:08,023 --> 01:34:10,711
Uh, brigadier general, sir.

1364
01:34:10,748 --> 01:34:13,499
Now, that's a cock and bull
story if I ever heard one.

1365
01:34:16,256 --> 01:34:19,609
It did happen, but also...

1366
01:34:21,541 --> 01:34:24,226
maybe I just wanted to see
what a war was like.

1367
01:34:24,264 --> 01:34:27,237
That's more like it.

1368
01:34:27,278 --> 01:34:29,384
You know what you are,
Courcey?

1369
01:34:29,423 --> 01:34:30,885
You're a tourist.

1370
01:34:30,926 --> 01:34:33,167
Too bad we couldn't have
shown you a better war.

1371
01:34:33,203 --> 01:34:35,279
Like hitting the beach
at Anzio...

1372
01:34:35,318 --> 01:34:37,840
or smashing through to Bastogne
with Patton.

1373
01:34:39,256 --> 01:34:41,649
That was a tour worth the money.

1374
01:34:41,692 --> 01:34:44,280
This one?

1375
01:34:44,318 --> 01:34:46,624
This one's a sucker's tour.

1376
01:34:46,659 --> 01:34:50,206
Going nowhere...
just round and round in circles.

1377
01:34:52,777 --> 01:34:54,688
Get on with the job,
corporal.

1378
01:35:18,051 --> 01:35:19,876
They tried to run away, sir.

1379
01:35:19,909 --> 01:35:22,331
They Cong. You look.

1380
01:35:27,725 --> 01:35:29,068
They steal guns.

1381
01:35:31,058 --> 01:35:32,751
They Cong.

1382
01:35:41,308 --> 01:35:42,836
You killed the kids!

1383
01:35:42,878 --> 01:35:44,474
Whoa! Easy, Courcey.

1384
01:35:44,514 --> 01:35:47,330
You look, sir. You look.

1385
01:36:08,729 --> 01:36:10,771
I sorry, sir.

1386
01:36:12,382 --> 01:36:15,550
I say to Corporal Courcey...

1387
01:36:15,586 --> 01:36:16,930
these communist people.

1388
01:36:30,514 --> 01:36:31,825
A-OK.

1389
01:36:33,142 --> 01:36:36,178
A-OK. A-OK.

1390
01:36:37,048 --> 01:36:39,156
Give me that flashlight.

1391
01:36:48,967 --> 01:36:50,626
I count eight.
I thought there were nine.

1392
01:36:50,663 --> 01:36:52,901
- Nine, sir.
- That little girl is missing.

1393
01:36:52,937 --> 01:36:54,347
Search the camp.

1394
01:36:54,381 --> 01:36:56,356
Yes, sir! Instamment!

1395
01:37:14,915 --> 01:37:16,192
It's their war.

1396
01:37:19,462 --> 01:37:21,124
Give me a hand with that crank.

1397
01:37:36,345 --> 01:37:38,256
OK, corporal.
Let's get moving...

1398
01:37:38,298 --> 01:37:41,018
before old Lard-ass
opens up with his howitzers.

1399
01:37:42,079 --> 01:37:43,608
We got ten seconds.

1400
01:37:57,905 --> 01:37:59,795
OK, kid. Let's go.

1401
01:38:03,385 --> 01:38:04,725
All right. Now.

1402
01:38:14,018 --> 01:38:15,296
You spike the machine guns?

1403
01:38:15,331 --> 01:38:18,335
It's done, sir.
The Cong girl... we not find her.

1404
01:38:18,376 --> 01:38:21,509
Well, we can't hang around
and worry about that.

1405
01:38:21,546 --> 01:38:22,921
You lead off. Take the wounded.

1406
01:38:25,937 --> 01:38:27,726
Come on. Hurry.

1407
01:39:23,149 --> 01:39:24,940
What's it look like?

1408
01:39:24,975 --> 01:39:26,799
All clear
as far as I can make out.

1409
01:39:26,834 --> 01:39:29,040
We'll rest here for a minute.

1410
01:39:29,076 --> 01:39:30,321
We're well protected...

1411
01:39:30,358 --> 01:39:32,847
just in case those howitzers
get their triangulations wrong.

1412
01:39:32,887 --> 01:39:34,000
He's stopped his mortars.

1413
01:39:34,040 --> 01:39:35,767
He's getting ready
to take the fort.

1414
01:39:35,803 --> 01:39:39,604
Charlie's fighting
goddamn feathers for a change.

1415
01:39:41,729 --> 01:39:43,486
Come on, Lard-ass, you're on.

1416
01:39:51,499 --> 01:39:53,097
Let's go fast, soldier.

1417
01:40:07,614 --> 01:40:08,859
When we get to those trees...

1418
01:40:08,896 --> 01:40:10,937
we'll turn north and
head for the road to Penang.

1419
01:40:10,977 --> 01:40:13,346
The trucks will be there
about daybreak to pick us up.

1420
01:40:13,379 --> 01:40:14,625
- Cowboy!
- Yes, sir!

1421
01:40:14,661 --> 01:40:16,932
Take a man
and check out the area ahead.

1422
01:41:57,109 --> 01:41:58,387
Where you hurt, kid?

1423
01:41:59,671 --> 01:42:02,936
L... I don't know. I feel blood
running down my legs.

1424
01:42:02,971 --> 01:42:05,623
Maybe you just crapped
your britches.

1425
01:42:05,661 --> 01:42:08,664
I have very strong
sphincter muscles, sir.

1426
01:42:12,998 --> 01:42:15,301
The little mothers
are comin' for us.

1427
01:42:41,252 --> 01:42:42,848
Ah.

1428
01:42:52,945 --> 01:42:54,857
Oh, shit.

1429
01:47:36,741 --> 01:47:39,198
I'm goin' home, Charlie...

1430
01:47:39,240 --> 01:47:40,672
if they'll let me.
