1
00:00:52,122 --> 00:00:55,558
I'm not a Christian,
I'm not an Atheist.

2
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:57,284
I'm not Jewish,

3
00:00:57,285 --> 00:00:58,856
I'm not Muslim.

4
00:00:58,857 --> 00:01:03,149
My Religion..
What I believe in?

5
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:07,850
Is called, The Constitution
Of The United States Of America.

6
00:01:25,917 --> 00:01:27,653
Hang on.
- Did you get that?

7
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:32,354
Let me open this up.

8
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:10,756
Okay, go ahead.

9
00:02:10,757 --> 00:02:14,417
If I'm not religious enough
for you, don't vote for me.

10
00:02:14,418 --> 00:02:16,724
If I'm not..uh..

11
00:02:16,725 --> 00:02:21,425
Experience enough for you,
don't vote for me.

12
00:02:25,085 --> 00:02:27,261
You know what,
Don't vote for me.

13
00:02:27,262 --> 00:02:29,887
Don't..
Don't do it.

14
00:02:29,888 --> 00:02:31,793
Whatever you do,
don't vote for me. How's that?

15
00:02:31,794 --> 00:02:33,937
- Okay.
- Okay, thanks.

16
00:02:33,938 --> 00:02:36,735
Can we get the monitors up a little,
I'd like the governor to be able to hear himself?

17
00:02:36,736 --> 00:02:38,421
You got it.

18
00:02:38,422 --> 00:02:43,836
Also, are we gonna put raisers under this podiums,
like we discussed in the pre-conditions?

19
00:02:43,837 --> 00:02:44,837
- No, I know.

20
00:02:44,663 --> 00:02:47,117
we canned inspection last night.

21
00:02:47,118 --> 00:02:48,412
They'll make something slide under there.

22
00:02:48,413 --> 00:02:49,753
- Okay, thank you.

23
00:02:49,754 --> 00:02:50,784
It's just they're few inches short.

24
00:02:50,785 --> 00:02:51,785
It makes it hard for him
to read his notes.

25
00:02:51,786 --> 00:02:53,225
- Okay.

26
00:02:53,226 --> 00:02:55,569
Gentlemen, Thank you..
and i'll see you in few hours.

27
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,451
I didn't know the governor has trouble
reading his notes. Why doesn't he wear glasses?

28
00:02:58,452 --> 00:02:59,894
No, he doesn't. Just, Pullman's just 5/8.

29
00:02:59,895 --> 00:03:04,595
He's gonna look like a Hobbit.

30

Well, it all comes down to this.</i>

33
00:03:25,525 --> 00:03:28,271
<i>We are one week away,
from the Ohio Primary.</i>

34
00:03:28,272 --> 00:03:29,272
<i>Two Democrats are left standing.</i>

35
00:03:29,273 --> 00:03:31,303
<i>Senator Pullman of Arkansas...</i>

36
00:03:31,304 --> 00:03:34,355
<i>Trailing Gov.Morris of Pennsylvania.</i>

37
00:03:34,356 --> 00:03:36,278
<i>Gov.Morris has mounted a sizeable lead.</i>

38
00:03:36,279 --> 00:03:38,623
<i>With two thousand and fourty seven delegates.</i>

39
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:41,905
<i>Winning New Hampshire, California..
New York and Michigan.</i>

40
00:03:41,906 --> 00:03:45,096
<i>But Sen.Pullman with
thirteen hundred and two delegates..</i>

<i>And Virginia and Missouri.</i>

<i>A win in Ohio could turn it all around.</i>

45

<i>For the Arkansas Senator.</i>

46
00:03:54,772 --> 00:03:58,938
<i>One week from Tuesday,
the all important Hundred and sixty-one Ohio delegates..</i>

47
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:00,832
<i>Could be the deciding factor.</i>

48
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:01,833
<i>Once again, it is true...</i>

49
00:04:01,834 --> 00:04:06,534

<i>&lt;font color="#3399FF"&gt;Sen.Pullman:&lt;/font&gt;
But you call yourself a Christian.</i>

51
00:04:09,426 --> 00:04:10,426
<i>- How would that matter?
&lt;font color="#3399FF"&gt;- Let me quote.&lt;/font&gt;</i>

52
00:04:10,412 --> 00:04:12,911
Let me quote:
" I have no Idea what happens when we die.

53
00:04:12,912 --> 00:04:16,972
Maybe, nothing.
Maybe, it's like before we were born".

54
00:04:16,973 --> 00:04:17,917
You did write this Governor.

55
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:18,918
Let me be specific.

56
00:04:18,593 --> 00:04:20,137
- Please do.

57
00:04:20,138 --> 00:04:23,001
I was raised a Catholic,
and I am no practising Catholic.

58
00:04:23,002 --> 00:04:25,559
And I have no idea,
What happens after we die.

59
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,186
If the senator does,
then..maybe you should be The President.

60
00:04:29,187 --> 00:04:31,063
Is that your idea of being specific?

61
00:04:31,064 --> 00:04:32,664
Let me be more specific.

62
00:04:32,665 --> 00:04:34,438
- Thank you.

63
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:36,326
I'm not a Christian or an Atheist.

64
00:04:36,327 --> 00:04:37,327
I'm not Jewish or Muslim.

65
00:04:37,328 --> 00:04:38,866
What I believe...

66
00:04:38,867 --> 00:04:41,366
My Religion is written on a piece of paper
called The Constitution.

67
00:04:41,367 --> 00:04:45,932
Meaning, that I'd defend until
my dying breath your right to worship..

68
00:04:45,933 --> 00:04:47,722
In whatever God you believe in.

69
00:04:47,723 --> 00:04:49,857
As long as it doesn't hurt others.

70
00:04:49,858 --> 00:04:53,340
I believe, we should be judged as a country
by how we take care of the people..

71
00:04:53,341 --> 00:04:55,091
who cannot take care of themselves.

72
00:04:55,092 --> 00:04:56,243
That's my religion!

73
00:04:56,244 --> 00:04:58,841
If you think i'm not religious enough,
Don't vote for me.

74
00:04:58,842 --> 00:05:01,766
If you think I'm not experience enough
or tall enough..

75
00:05:01,767 --> 00:05:02,814
Then, don't vote for me.

76
00:05:02,815 --> 00:05:04,606
'Cos I can't change that to get elected.

77
00:05:04,607 --> 00:05:08,781
- I just want you to say out loud,
If you believe in the teachings of The Bible?

78
00:05:08,782 --> 00:05:12,130
Is this a Democratic primary
or a general election?

79
00:05:12,131 --> 00:05:13,131
Well, Governor whoever wins this contest..

80
00:05:13,132 --> 00:05:14,885
will be running for The President.

81
00:05:14,886 --> 00:05:17,015
And If you think,
that this questions...

82
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:19,184
won't be central in the general election.

83
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:21,384
Then, you're living in Fantasy Land!

84
00:05:21,385 --> 00:05:23,074
I'm simply pointing to the obvious.

85
00:05:23,075 --> 00:05:26,100
We are running for
President of The United States.

86
00:05:26,101 --> 00:05:30,801
Not, Student Council President.

87
00:05:57,076 --> 00:05:59,893
Fucking National Security.

88
00:05:59,894 --> 00:06:04,594
Out of the park.
- Home run.

89
00:06:11,995 --> 00:06:16,695
You know, I'm trying to remember  if the
Democrats have ever nominated an Atheist before.

90
00:06:16,987 --> 00:06:21,122
- Well, we know they've nominated a JackAss before.

91
00:06:21,123 --> 00:06:23,712
That must've been you,
that did the prep work..Steven.

92
00:06:23,713 --> 00:06:25,353
Paul's not that clever.

93
00:06:25,354 --> 00:06:28,380
- You've always said the brain stuffs about me.

94
00:06:28,381 --> 00:06:29,463
I've had the Balls.

95
00:06:29,464 --> 00:06:33,574
Well, it looks like
you've got some brains now, too.

96
00:06:33,575 --> 00:06:38,275
Becareful, I just might have
to steal him from you.

97
00:06:39,285 --> 00:06:43,985
What a Prick!

98
00:07:06,598 --> 00:07:08,690
So..Paul, tell me something
I don't know.

99
00:07:08,691 --> 00:07:12,491
Tell me what's going to
happen on the 15th?

100
00:07:12,492 --> 00:07:16,672
What?

101
00:07:16,673 --> 00:07:18,484
What do you think, Stevie?

102
00:07:18,485 --> 00:07:23,185
- I think it's ours for the taking.
What do you think?

103
00:07:23,678 --> 00:07:26,209
What do you think..Ida?

104
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,943
- I'm asking you.

105
00:07:27,944 --> 00:07:30,266
Well, you tell me..I'll tell you.

106
00:07:30,267 --> 00:07:31,997
- If I have to say, I'd say...

107
00:07:31,998 --> 00:07:33,438
It will be close.
But, You'll eek it out.

108
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:36,048
Eek?

109
00:07:36,049 --> 00:07:38,572
You see, she's trying to get under my skin.

110
00:07:38,573 --> 00:07:39,573
- So, what's gonna happen?

111
00:07:39,056 --> 00:07:42,064
Us..by Nine.

112
00:07:42,065 --> 00:07:44,285
- So, you're certain you're gonna win here?

113
00:07:44,286 --> 00:07:45,894
Certain? No.
But, confident?  Yeah.

114
00:07:45,895 --> 00:07:46,895
You just said, you'll win by nine.

115
00:07:46,786 --> 00:07:48,072
And I think that we will!

116
00:07:48,073 --> 00:07:49,285
But i'm not gonna tell you,
It's a sure thing,

117
00:07:49,286 --> 00:07:51,785
I mean, fucking St.Gabriel
could blow his horn on election day..

118
00:07:51,786 --> 00:07:54,328
and get his four horsemen
to rig the ballot box for Pullman..

119
00:07:54,329 --> 00:07:56,455
and it wouldn't surprise me.

120
00:07:56,456 --> 00:07:59,183
Six Presidentials that I've done
and I've never felt this good.

121
00:07:59,184 --> 00:08:02,749
But, i'm not gonna sit here and say..
Yeah, hey..we'll win Ohio.

122
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,446
Not a chance.

123
00:08:04,447 --> 00:08:07,911
In the last 30 years,  seventy-three Democrats
have run for President..How many have won?

124
00:08:07,912 --> 00:08:08,912
Three.

125
00:08:08,763 --> 00:08:11,393
That means, 70 guys have run
with the thought that they had a chance,

126
00:08:11,394 --> 00:08:13,486
and they all lost.

127
00:08:13,487 --> 00:08:15,795
- So, you're saying..there's a good chance
that you won't win?

128
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:18,258
Don't twist my words, Ida.
What i'm saying is..

129
00:08:18,259 --> 00:08:20,207
I'm not gonna promise you we'll win.

130
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,707
But he's decorated by Bush Senior
from the first Gulf War..

131
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:25,207
He protested the second
and he left the state with a balance..

132
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,895
budget and the 4th highest education rate.

133
00:08:27,896 --> 00:08:28,976
The Republicans...

134
00:08:28,977 --> 00:08:31,664
have no one out there,
that could touch this guy.

135
00:08:31,665 --> 00:08:32,704
So, for this moment;

136
00:08:32,705 --> 00:08:37,405
This election...this primary is
the presidential.

137
00:08:37,528 --> 00:08:41,710
And that.. Ida..
Is the state of the union.

138
00:08:41,711 --> 00:08:44,487
And on that note--

139
00:08:44,488 --> 00:08:48,337
I'm gonna take a shit.

140
00:08:48,338 --> 00:08:49,538
So, Steven?

141
00:08:49,539 --> 00:08:50,803
- So, Ida.

142
00:08:50,804 --> 00:08:52,403
Steven, Steven..Steven.

143
00:08:52,404 --> 00:08:53,967
- Ida, Ida..Ida.

144
00:08:53,968 --> 00:08:54,968
What's going on at the airport?

145
00:08:54,969 --> 00:08:55,969
Yeah.

146
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,210
And getting on a plane.

147
00:08:57,211 --> 00:08:58,887
- That's what you do, at the airport. Yeah.

148
00:08:58,888 --> 00:09:00,796
Where's that plane going?

149
00:09:00,797 --> 00:09:02,662
Okay,

150
00:09:02,663 --> 00:09:04,827
I'll give you three guesses.

151
00:09:04,828 --> 00:09:06,385
He's not going back to Head Quarters.

152
00:09:06,386 --> 00:09:07,386
- Correct.

153
00:09:07,152 --> 00:09:08,771
He's not going to Texas?

154
00:09:08,772 --> 00:09:09,772
- No need.

155
00:09:09,773 --> 00:09:10,962
We're gonna split Texas,
so it's a wash.

156
00:09:10,963 --> 00:09:12,781
What if I've said, North Carolina?

157
00:09:12,782 --> 00:09:14,881
- I'll say, a guess.

158
00:09:14,882 --> 00:09:16,148
He's going to North Carolina.

159
00:09:16,149 --> 00:09:17,149
- I can't neither confirm or deny that.

160
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:19,251
I knew it.
Now, tell me why?

161
00:09:19,252 --> 00:09:21,451
I cannot do that.

162
00:09:21,452 --> 00:09:22,756
I hate you.

163
00:09:22,757 --> 00:09:24,395
- You love me.

164
00:09:24,396 --> 00:09:25,956
I love Paul,
You..hate.

165
00:09:25,957 --> 00:09:27,890
You love him,
because he gives you the scoops.

166
00:09:27,891 --> 00:09:29,375
Sexual favours.

167
00:09:29,376 --> 00:09:30,960
You're engaged?

168
00:09:30,961 --> 00:09:35,653
If it meant a good scoop..
My fiancee will understand.

169
00:09:35,654 --> 00:09:38,092
You're really buying into this crap.

170
00:09:38,093 --> 00:09:40,399
All this take back the country nonsense.

171
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,977
Ida?

172
00:09:41,978 --> 00:09:43,667
I'm not naive, okay?

173
00:09:43,668 --> 00:09:46,778
I've worked on more campaigns
most people will have, by the time they're 40.

174
00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:49,723
I'm telling you..
This is the One!

175
00:09:49,724 --> 00:09:51,337
You really have drunk the cool-aid?

176
00:09:51,338 --> 00:09:54,457
- I have drunk. It's delicious!

177
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:55,222
Look?

178
00:09:55,223 --> 00:09:57,536
I don't care if he happens to be
leading in the polls..

179
00:09:57,537 --> 00:10:00,029
I don't care if he happens to have
all the right tools..

180
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,010
The truth is..

181
00:10:01,011 --> 00:10:02,488
He's the only one..

182
00:10:02,489 --> 00:10:05,608
that's gonna actually
make a differencein peoples lives.

183
00:10:05,609 --> 00:10:07,606
Even the people, that hate him.

184
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,666
If Mike Morris is President,
this is more about us..

185
00:10:10,667 --> 00:10:11,667
then it does about him.

186
00:10:11,668 --> 00:10:14,850
I don't give a fuck..
If he can't win.

187
00:10:14,851 --> 00:10:16,067
He has to win.

188
00:10:16,068 --> 00:10:17,209
- or what?

189
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:21,049
The world's gonna fall apart?

190
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:23,021
It won't matter.

191
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:24,951
Not one bit...

192
00:10:24,952 --> 00:10:28,675
To the everyday lives of the
everyday fuckers, who get up,

193
00:10:28,676 --> 00:10:31,863
and work and eat and sleep.
Go back to work again.

194
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:32,864
If your boy wins..

195
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:35,207
You get a job in the White House.

196
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:38,771
He looses, you're back
at a consulting firm on K-street.

197
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:40,827
That's it!

198
00:10:40,828 --> 00:10:45,528
You used to know that,
before you got goosebumpy about this guy.

199
00:10:45,589 --> 00:10:47,919
Mike Morris is a politician.

200
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,836
He's a nice guy.
They're all nice guys!

201
00:10:50,837 --> 00:10:53,465
He will let you down.

202
00:10:53,466 --> 00:10:58,166
Sooner or later.

203
00:11:13,758 --> 00:11:14,842
This is 'off-off' the record.

204
00:11:14,843 --> 00:11:16,692
- What?

205
00:11:16,693 --> 00:11:18,006
Franklin Thompson...

206
00:11:18,007 --> 00:11:19,007
- Seriously?

207
00:11:19,008 --> 00:11:20,008
Off the record.

208
00:11:20,009 --> 00:11:21,009
going through the Governor, Steven and Me.

209
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,429
- My lips are sealed.

210
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:25,089
Tomorrow I have a meeting
at Thompson's house.

211
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,765
- He's going to endorse us?

212
00:11:26,766 --> 00:11:28,477
After I'm done talking to him.
What do you think?

213
00:11:28,478 --> 00:11:30,550
- That's huge!

214
00:11:30,551 --> 00:11:31,890
It's more than huge.

215
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:34,477
There's 356 pledged delegates..

216
00:11:34,478 --> 00:11:36,066
They all travels with him;

217
00:11:36,067 --> 00:11:38,038
Puts us over the top.

218
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:40,408
- He said publicly,
he's not gonna endorse anybody.

219
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:40,949
Yeah, well...

220
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,313
That's what they all say,
until you get 'em alone at the room.

221
00:11:43,314 --> 00:11:44,746
- So, this is for real?

222
00:11:44,747 --> 00:11:46,440
Yup.

223
00:11:46,441 --> 00:11:47,865
Just gotta put it in the bag.

224
00:11:47,866 --> 00:11:50,113
- When are you gonna announce?

225
00:11:50,114 --> 00:11:53,819
Nope, that's all you get for now.

226
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,537
Okay, listen up!

227
00:11:56,538 --> 00:11:58,280
These are your new cellphones.

228
00:11:58,281 --> 00:11:59,766
Shelley's pre-programmed the numbers,

229
00:11:59,767 --> 00:12:00,767
Thank you Shelley.
No personal calls.

230
00:12:00,768 --> 00:12:01,925
Kevin?

231
00:12:01,926 --> 00:12:03,547
If you loose them,

232
00:12:03,548 --> 00:12:05,503
The D.M.C will come to your house.

233
00:12:05,504 --> 00:12:07,204
New cellphone,
just gave em all new ones.

234
00:12:07,205 --> 00:12:08,205
I'll get it later.

235
00:12:08,206 --> 00:12:10,390
<i>Morris on TV: ...I gotta believe we can do it.</i>

236
00:12:10,391 --> 00:12:12,229
<i>We have enemies,
we have to understand,</i>

237
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,294
<i> Why our enemies are our enemies?</i>

238
00:12:13,295 --> 00:12:15,292
<i>And see if there's something we can do about it.</i>

239
00:12:15,293 --> 00:12:17,586
<i>Besides, just using force.
As we know...</i>

240
00:12:17,587 --> 00:12:21,552
<i>From history, the answer to extremism
can't be extremism.</i>

241
00:12:21,553 --> 00:12:23,374
Fucking kill me.

242
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,826
Where did we get this?

243
00:12:25,827 --> 00:12:28,131
Sometime, in Pennsylvania before he annouce.

244
00:12:28,132 --> 00:12:30,111
Thank God, he was in overseas.

245
00:12:30,112 --> 00:12:30,941
Just get rid of it.

246
00:12:30,942 --> 00:12:32,611
Yeah, but if this was already placed ,
why would this bother us...

247
00:12:32,612 --> 00:12:33,495
Are you fucking stoned?

248
00:12:33,496 --> 00:12:36,675
This is exact same piece The Republicans,
are gonna run against him in the general.

249
00:12:36,676 --> 00:12:38,618
We don't need to brag about it.

250
00:12:38,619 --> 00:12:41,118
<i>"Hi, I'm Neville Chamberlain.
I'd like to be your Commander in Chief.</i>

251
00:12:41,119 --> 00:12:42,528
- But then, this is gonna come out anyways.

252
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:43,529
It's gonna come out.

253
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:46,987
But it's not gonna come out
'Paid For It by Us' pal.

254
00:12:46,988 --> 00:12:49,487
You think there's any truth,
in this..Pullman having investments..

255
00:12:49,488 --> 00:12:51,987
diamond mines in Liberia?

256
00:12:51,988 --> 00:12:52,931
- Still checking on it.

257
00:12:52,932 --> 00:12:55,259
But, we got it from a blog,
who the fuck knows.

258
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,844
- I don't care, if it's true..
I just wanna hear him denying it.

259
00:12:57,845 --> 00:13:00,440
If it's true..Great!
Find out. If not...

260
00:13:00,441 --> 00:13:02,847
let them spend the day,
telling The Post,

261
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:05,556
that he doesn't own
a diamond mine in Liberia.

262
00:13:05,557 --> 00:13:06,594
Win-Win.

263
00:13:06,595 --> 00:13:09,259
Okay.

264
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,852
We gotta counter that Christian shit,
we take it from last night.

265
00:13:11,853 --> 00:13:14,126
I need the new 30 in 60 seconds spot.

266
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:18,827
We can show him in
staff meeting this afternoon.

267
00:13:26,402 --> 00:13:27,182
Hey.
- Hey.

268
00:13:27,183 --> 00:13:29,630
uhh..Ben wanted me
to get you sign off on this,

269
00:13:29,631 --> 00:13:31,767
Before the staff meeting.

270
00:13:31,768 --> 00:13:36,468
Thank you, I've been waiting for this.

271
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:40,000
Anything interesting?

272
00:13:40,001 --> 00:13:42,255
Just these some White Paper
I've to hand out tonight.

273
00:13:42,256 --> 00:13:44,574
- What's White Paper?

274
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:47,144
Negative shits.

275
00:13:47,145 --> 00:13:51,035
Our guys do research..
we feed it to the press and we see what sticks.

276
00:13:51,036 --> 00:13:53,631
- What kind of negative shits?

277
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:55,665
You'll read it in the paper tomorrow.

278
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:56,666
- Which paper?

279
00:13:56,667 --> 00:13:59,418
Any, any paper.

280
00:13:59,419 --> 00:14:01,084
- So, it's something big?

281
00:14:01,085 --> 00:14:03,033
I wish it was something bigger.

282
00:14:03,034 --> 00:14:04,699
It's just these..

283
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:08,240
transportation numbers I'm gonna
have to spend pretty hard to make it stick.

284
00:14:08,241 --> 00:14:09,680
- That's what you're good at though, right?

285
00:14:09,681 --> 00:14:11,754
I guess.

286
00:14:11,755 --> 00:14:15,316
Tell him it's fine.

287
00:14:15,317 --> 00:14:16,603
Did you get your new phone?

288
00:14:16,604 --> 00:14:18,120
- Mmmhm.

289
00:14:18,121 --> 00:14:20,770
It's really exciting isn't it?

290
00:14:20,771 --> 00:14:23,169
What are you, a bearcat?

291
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,970
- Am I a what?

292
00:14:24,971 --> 00:14:26,988
Cincinatti bearcat?

293
00:14:26,989 --> 00:14:31,171
Ohh! no..i'm not from here.

294
00:14:31,172 --> 00:14:35,872
I worked with you in Iowa, actually.

295
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:37,757
That's right.

296
00:14:37,758 --> 00:14:39,951
You changed something.

297
00:14:39,952 --> 00:14:41,419
My hair?

298
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,059
You changed your hair?

299
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:46,126
- No.

300
00:14:46,127 --> 00:14:47,901
I see.

301
00:14:47,902 --> 00:14:50,493
I betcha, I look like a
real dumb-ass right now, huh?

302
00:14:50,494 --> 00:14:52,022
- No! not at all.

303
00:14:52,023 --> 00:14:55,359
You're the big man on campus.
I'm just a lowly intern.

304
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,122
Oh, it's not like that.

305
00:14:57,123 --> 00:14:59,072
You get to stay at The Millennium.

306
00:14:59,073 --> 00:15:01,389
Okay? They put us in a Motel on the
other side of the river.

307
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,583
You're right.
I am the big man on campus.

308
00:15:03,584 --> 00:15:04,584
- Now you're starting to see.

309
00:15:04,427 --> 00:15:05,506
Mmhmm.

310
00:15:05,507 --> 00:15:07,861
We do have a better bar, though.

311
00:15:07,862 --> 00:15:09,066
I've heard that.

312
00:15:09,067 --> 00:15:10,984
You should come by, one night.

313
00:15:10,985 --> 00:15:13,050
Have a drink with the worker-bees.

314
00:15:13,051 --> 00:15:15,245
I might do that.

315
00:15:15,246 --> 00:15:16,835
I might do that.
What's a good night?

316
00:15:16,836 --> 00:15:17,836
- Tonight's good.
- Tonight?

317
00:15:17,837 --> 00:15:19,990
Tuesday night?
- yeah.

318
00:15:19,991 --> 00:15:20,991
It's quite.

319
00:15:20,992 --> 00:15:25,128
Quite's good.

320
00:15:25,129 --> 00:15:27,683
Well, you have my number.

321
00:15:27,684 --> 00:15:29,834
- I do?

322
00:15:29,835 --> 00:15:31,664
It's programmed right there on your phone.

323
00:15:31,665 --> 00:15:33,548
- Uh huh.

324
00:15:33,549 --> 00:15:34,964
Under... Mary.

325
00:15:34,965 --> 00:15:39,331
I know your name is Mary.

326
00:15:39,332 --> 00:15:44,032
- My name is Molly.

327
00:15:54,117 --> 00:15:55,932
That's what I'm hearing since.

328
00:15:55,933 --> 00:16:00,149
Super Tuesday. All of a sudden,
I am a popular guy.

329
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:02,173
What are the polls telling you?

330
00:16:02,174 --> 00:16:04,688
That Pullman's negatives are high.

331
00:16:04,689 --> 00:16:07,259
Coming at fourties.

332
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:10,560
Senator, we have an open seat at White House.

333
00:16:10,561 --> 00:16:12,394
Republicans have dick.

334
00:16:12,395 --> 00:16:14,344
They're disorganised...

335
00:16:14,345 --> 00:16:18,044
they can't find a nominee,
that's not a world class fucked up.

336
00:16:18,045 --> 00:16:20,822
They look lilke Democrats.

337
00:16:20,823 --> 00:16:24,891
No Republicans are gonna show up
to vote their guy.

338
00:16:24,892 --> 00:16:28,562
But if Pullman's got a Democratic nod,
they will show up to vote against him.

339
00:16:28,563 --> 00:16:31,257
You think, if they won't for your guy,
you think Morris gets into the independents?

340
00:16:31,258 --> 00:16:32,872
I sure do.

341
00:16:32,873 --> 00:16:36,597
Senator, I'm a bit confused.

342
00:16:36,598 --> 00:16:39,667
We need your delegates.

343
00:16:39,668 --> 00:16:41,619
We need you,

344
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:44,029
your fund raising..

345
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:47,709
and I guess,

346
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:49,659
It was my understanding that,

347
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:52,549
your endorsement, a week for Ohio-

348
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:57,250
would win this for us.

349
00:17:00,572 --> 00:17:01,529
Thank you.

350
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:03,619
Stella.

351
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:08,320
Hand me that Ice-bucket.

352
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,931
Is this Paul or is this you?

353
00:17:10,932 --> 00:17:12,724
Paul knows and Paul agrees.

354
00:17:12,725 --> 00:17:14,954
Ben, where's my outback piece on National Service?

355
00:17:14,955 --> 00:17:16,964
It's easy for me to work off with that.

356
00:17:16,965 --> 00:17:17,965
- Got it right here.

357
00:17:17,966 --> 00:17:20,849
Get me a hard copy,
I hate those fucking things.

358
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:25,199
-Molly, can you grab that out for me.
- Yeah, one second.

359
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:29,900
So, Governor if you wanna change...
- Just give me a sec, will you.

360
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:37,563
Your National Service isn't pulling
the same as the rest of your Domestic Policy.

361
00:17:37,564 --> 00:17:38,439
I don't give a shit about the polling..

362
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,879
Steven, I'm not gonna play this game with you.

363
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,582
This is your,
good cop-bad cop act with Paul.

364
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:44,583
- Good cop..good cop.

365
00:17:44,584 --> 00:17:49,284
I'm not changing it.

366
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,789
Here we go.

367
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:03,965
Alright, let's see.

368
00:18:03,966 --> 00:18:05,091
It says, we're gonna..

369
00:18:05,092 --> 00:18:07,941
Help them get education,
We're gonna create a national unity.

370
00:18:07,942 --> 00:18:09,749
We're gonna teach young people to trade.

371
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,781
And..we are going to get them out of debt,
from their college loans.

372
00:18:12,782 --> 00:18:13,782
Now, where does that fail?

373
00:18:13,783 --> 00:18:14,939
- All of that is exactly right, Governor.

374
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,719
It's just that,
if you're gonna do it..do it.

375
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,629
Make it mandatory, not voluntary.

376
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:21,897
That'll poll well.

377
00:18:21,898 --> 00:18:23,299
- Mandatory.

378
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:27,480
Everybody who turns eighteen or
graduates high-school gives two years of service..

379
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:28,481
to his or her country.

380
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:30,949
It could be in the military,
peace corps...

381
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:33,449
plant a fucking trees..I don't care.
And for that...

382
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,549
your college education is paid for.
Period.

383
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:36,550
- We do all of that right here.

384
00:18:36,551 --> 00:18:37,551
No, sir. You don't.

385
00:18:37,552 --> 00:18:38,989
Not all the way.
Do it all the way.

386
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,519
Mandatory.

387
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,359
- Paul likes this?
- Mmmhm.

388
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,669
You're my brain trust.

389
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:47,368
The beauty of it is,
everybody who's over the age of 18

390
00:18:47,369 --> 00:18:49,788
or pass age of eligibility
will be for it.

391
00:18:49,789 --> 00:18:50,789
Why not?

392
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,140
And all of the others?

393
00:18:52,141 --> 00:18:54,649
Can't vote.

394
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:59,350
Too young.

395
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:05,360
Too bad.

396
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:11,840
You can't loose.

397
00:19:11,885 --> 00:19:14,084
uh, Steven?

398
00:19:14,085 --> 00:19:15,344
You have a call on line 3.

399
00:19:15,345 --> 00:19:16,798
It's your dad.

400
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,279
Okay!

401
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,481
You and Ben get working on this
stump speech and you get me a hard copy.

402
00:19:22,482 --> 00:19:23,839
And I'll write it my own words.

403
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,675
Don't forget your Charlie Ross at Six.

404
00:19:25,676 --> 00:19:26,676
- Right.

405
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,839
What am I doing here?

406
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,778
- It's on low form,
he's flying in.

407
00:19:29,779 --> 00:19:30,919
Paul going?

408
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:35,620
Paul won't be here,
but Ben and I will take you.

409
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,360
Just don't tell me someone just died.

410
00:19:37,361 --> 00:19:38,939
<i>- Hey, Steve?</i>

411
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,900
Who is this?

412
00:19:39,901 --> 00:19:40,901
<i>- Tom Duffy.</i>

413
00:19:40,902 --> 00:19:42,812
<i>Sorry about the dad bit.</i>

414
00:19:42,813 --> 00:19:47,574
<i>I uh, I just figured you wouldn't
my name called out on Morris's Campaign Office.</i>

415
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,739
What do you want?

416
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,759
<i>- You got a couple of minutes,
I'd like to sit down with you?</i>

417
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,810
What for?

418
00:19:52,811 --> 00:19:55,039
<i>- Well, it's important.</i>

419
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:59,740
Well, if it's important,
don't you think you should be calling Paul?

420
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,523
<i>- This is on the up and up, Steve.
Just give me five minutes.</i>

421
00:20:06,524 --> 00:20:07,260
I can't be talking to you.

422
00:20:07,261 --> 00:20:08,849
<i>- I hear you.</i>

423
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:11,707
<i>But if you have five minutes,
I'm gonna be on the Hadfort's sports bar.</i>

424
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:12,708
<i>For the next couple of hours.</i>

425
00:20:12,709 --> 00:20:15,659
I can't, Tom.

426
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,100
<i>- There won't be anybody there.</i>

427
00:20:17,101 --> 00:20:19,269
<i>Okay?</i>

428
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:23,970
<i>If you get the chance,
there's something I wanna show to you. </i>

429
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:45,160
Paul, call me back.
It's important.

430
00:20:54,131 --> 00:20:55,278
<i>Tom: You're working for the wrong man.</i>

431
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:56,440
- You are working for the wrong man.
- Oh, on the contrary..

432
00:20:56,441 --> 00:20:59,589
You're working for the wrong man.

433
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,649
And you've got something that
the other guys don't have.

434
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:02,372
- Oh, yeah?

435
00:21:02,373 --> 00:21:03,373
Yeah, what is that exactly?

436
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:05,493
Charm..is not the right word.

437
00:21:05,494 --> 00:21:06,301
It is the right word.

438
00:21:06,302 --> 00:21:07,849
No, it's more than that.

439
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:11,849
You exudes something.
You draw people in.

440
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:13,859
All reporters love you.
Even the ones that hates you.

441
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,059
Love you.

442
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,498
Cos, you play them all like
they're pieces on chess-board.

443
00:21:17,499 --> 00:21:19,889
And you make it look, effortless!

444
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:21,819
We both know, How hard it is.

445
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,373
Constantly be on guard..

446
00:21:23,374 --> 00:21:26,599
weighing every word,
every moment.

447
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:31,069
From the outside, you make it look easy.

448
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:33,770
People are scared of you,
cos they don't understand how you do it.

449
00:21:33,771 --> 00:21:35,539
And they love you, for it!

450
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:38,769
And that is the most
valuable thing in this business.

451
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:40,529
The ability to win people's respect,

452
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:44,183
By making them mistake their fear, for love.

453
00:21:44,184 --> 00:21:45,630
You can guess what i'm gonna say next.

454
00:21:45,631 --> 00:21:46,670
- I don't think that I can.

455
00:21:46,671 --> 00:21:49,569
I want you to work for us.

456
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:51,250
- Well, you're kidding.

457
00:21:51,251 --> 00:21:54,869
No, not in the least.

458
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:56,559
You're gonna loose Ohio.

459
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,019
- I'm not.

460
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,319
You're sitting on about a six percent
lead on both polls.

461
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,015
Six percent of all Democrats poll.

462
00:22:03,016 --> 00:22:04,016
- Eight!

463
00:22:04,017 --> 00:22:05,017
No. Six.

464
00:22:05,018 --> 00:22:06,018
Doesn't matter.

465
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:08,039
Ohio is an open primary, right.

466
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:11,279
Independents and Republicans
get to vote on the Democratic candidates.

467
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,289
- Do you think, they like your guy?

468
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:16,550
A pro-choice tax and spend the roof.

469
00:22:16,551 --> 00:22:17,999
Fuck no!
They hate him.

470
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,839
They think they can beat my guy.

471
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:25,540
But they're very worried about yours.

472
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:29,955
So, start tomorrow morning,
they're gonna see a fucking blitz.

473
00:22:29,956 --> 00:22:32,261
Lymboyle, Hennedy
all those right wing blocks,

474
00:22:32,262 --> 00:22:34,429
are starting the 'get out the vote' campaign.

475
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:36,349
It's started already.

476
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:38,639
Every fucking conservative in Ohio..

477
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,020
Is gonna line up around the block,
to punch my guy's ticket.

478
00:22:41,021 --> 00:22:42,021
And that's just one step!

479
00:22:42,022 --> 00:22:44,509
Ohio's gone.

480
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:46,169
Polls don't mean shit.

481
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:48,149
Tomorrow morning,
everybody's gonna know.

482
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:52,850
And that's why, I want you to
handle the fall-out that we'll have in the press.

483
00:22:54,931 --> 00:22:57,589
Oh, we got Thompson in the bag, too.

484
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:59,796
- I know for a fact,
that you don't have Thompson.

485
00:22:59,797 --> 00:23:01,431
Well, we promised him Secretary of State.

486
00:23:01,432 --> 00:23:06,132
Ohio is over.
It has been over for weeks.

487
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:10,869
And now with Thompson's delegates?

488
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:12,359
I'm thinking down the road here, man.

489
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,719
That is why, I want you.

490
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,639
- I can't do it!
- Wring in straight at the top.

491
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,209
I don't need an answer
right this moment.

492
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:21,836
Look, I play dirty, alright.

493
00:23:21,837 --> 00:23:22,837
I'm sorry to hear that.

494
00:23:22,838 --> 00:23:23,838
- But I don't have to play dirty anymore.

495
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:25,799
You know why?

496
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,026
I got Morris!

497
00:23:27,027 --> 00:23:29,875
None of this is about
The Democratic process, Steve.

498
00:23:29,876 --> 00:23:30,876
It is about getting your guy off.

499
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,373
- This is the kind of shit
that The Republicans pull.

500
00:23:32,374 --> 00:23:34,578
Yeah, You know what?
This is the kind of shit,

501
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:35,579
that The Republicans pull.

502
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,039
And it's about time,
that we learn from them.

503
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,230
They're meaner, they are tougher..

504
00:23:39,231 --> 00:23:42,179
They are more disciplined than we are.

505
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:45,319
I've been in this business 25 years,
and I've seen way too many Democrats..

506
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,594
bite the dust.

507
00:23:46,595 --> 00:23:51,295
Because they wouldn't get down the mud,
with the fucking elephants!

508
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:57,782
Paul's my friend.

509
00:23:57,783 --> 00:23:58,783
You wanna work for the friend..

510
00:23:58,784 --> 00:24:02,641
or do you wanna work for The President?

511
00:24:02,642 --> 00:24:03,591
Think about it.

512
00:24:03,592 --> 00:24:08,292
You got my number.

513
00:24:08,347 --> 00:24:09,046
Paul?

514
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:11,249
- Is there anymore..?
that we're doing??

515
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,051
Not that I'm aware of.

516
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:14,844
What's going on with Thompson?

517
00:24:14,845 --> 00:24:18,366
- Ahh, he wants something...

518
00:24:18,367 --> 00:24:20,400
we'll be fine.

519
00:24:20,401 --> 00:24:23,381
What's so important?

520
00:24:23,382 --> 00:24:28,082
- Nothing, I've figured it out.

521
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:34,319
Alright.

522
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,807
I'll be on my cell,
if you need me.

523
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,918
I fly D.C..tomorrow.
Will be back tomorrow night.

524
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:38,919
Okay.

525
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,920
I'll work on the

526
00:24:39,921 --> 00:24:44,621
Good man.

527
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,439
Check the blogs,
if there's any chatter. Would you?

528
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,099
- Chatter? What kind of chatter?

529
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,399
I don't know.
Just see what they're talking about.

530
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,159
Steven, are you still single?

531
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,729
- I'm married to the campaign, Governor.

532
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:05,258
Married to the campaign.
Good answer.

533
00:25:05,259 --> 00:25:07,367
Wall Street Journal has us number
holding steady..

534
00:25:07,368 --> 00:25:08,368
Pullman dropped a point.

535
00:25:08,369 --> 00:25:09,369
- Really?

536
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:10,895
- When did they do that?
- I'm checking it out.

537
00:25:10,896 --> 00:25:13,754
Governor, The Wall Street Journal
numbers are in and Pullman's down a point.

538
00:25:13,755 --> 00:25:16,699
- We are moving in a right direction.

539
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,369
Ben, are you still single?

540
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:19,690
- Married to the campaign, Governor.

541
00:25:19,691 --> 00:25:21,699
Crack team.

542
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:26,400
Make sure Charlie Ross has
those numbers before he goes on.

543
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:30,509
Get a copy of the show
before we leave too.

544
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:32,829
Is it a difficult decision?
I have to believe it is.

545
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,274
Would I do it?

546
00:25:34,275 --> 00:25:35,759
No. But...

547
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,418
I can't see myself or anyone..
certainly not a government, telling a woman..

548
00:25:38,419 --> 00:25:40,644
what she should do with her body.

549
00:25:40,645 --> 00:25:43,359
So, you would appoint a Judge?
- We'd consider it arrogant...

550
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,369
to judge anyone..
until i've walked in their shoes.

551
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:47,860
- But you're against the death penalty?

552
00:25:47,861 --> 00:25:48,861
Mmhmm.

553
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,905
Because of what it says about us,
as a society.

554
00:25:50,906 --> 00:25:52,938
- Suppose Governor,
It was your wife?

555
00:25:52,939 --> 00:25:53,939
- If she's murdered?

556
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,579
What would I do?

557
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,940
It gets more complicated
when it's personal.

558
00:25:56,941 --> 00:25:57,949
Sure.

559
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:01,929
Well, If I could get to him.

560
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:03,759
I would find a way to kill him.

561
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,309
- So, You...you governor
would impose a death penalty?

562
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:11,169
No, I would commit a crime,
for which I'd happily go to jail.

563
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:13,875
- Then, why not
let the society, Do that?

564
00:26:13,876 --> 00:26:16,979
Because society, has to be better
than the individual.

565
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:19,205
If I were to do that,
I would be wrong!

566
00:26:19,206 --> 00:26:20,206
- What about guns?

567
00:26:20,207 --> 00:26:21,207
Isn't it time for commercial?

568
00:26:21,208 --> 00:26:24,741
- This is a public television.
We don't have any commercial.

569
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,805
That's unfortunate.

570
00:26:25,806 --> 00:26:28,209
Where did you go after Iowa?

571
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:31,879
- California.
Super Tuesday.

572
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,470
I had to got to New York.

573
00:26:33,471 --> 00:26:35,209
- I know.

574
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:39,910
You guys need even a lot more help, overthere.

575
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:45,459
So, Why politics?

576
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:48,939
- Because the pay is so good, obviously.

577
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,314
It seems like a very odd...

578
00:26:51,315 --> 00:26:52,269
fit.

579
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:56,970
My dad is Jack Stearns.

580
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:59,339
He's a good guy.

581
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,329
- He's an Asshole.

582
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:03,809
But, he is your boss.

583
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:07,529
He is not my boss.

584
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:09,919
He is the head of The DMC.

585
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,292
- You don't work for
The Democratic National Committee?

586
00:27:12,293 --> 00:27:13,999
No, I work for Paul.

587
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,569
Paul work for Morris.
If Morris wins, He's gonna be your Dad's Boss.

588
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:21,229
- Don't tell my dad that.

589
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:23,319
I don't tell your dad, a lot of things.

590
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:28,020
- Never.

591
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,239
What time you got work tomorrow?

592
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:34,646
- Nine A.M.

593
00:27:34,647 --> 00:27:37,839
I'm showing the new interns
how to rope all call.

594
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,890
Cos i'm an experienced intern.

595
00:27:38,891 --> 00:27:42,619
You see?

596
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:46,909
I see.

597
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:49,589
How old are you?

598
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:53,089
How old you think, I am?

599
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:54,849
- Thirty.

600
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:56,559
You think I'm Thirty?

601
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,939
- I am Sorry,

602
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:00,040
How old are you?

603
00:28:00,041 --> 00:28:04,741
Thirty.

604
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,539
How old are you?

605
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:11,559
- How old do you think, I am?

606
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,670
Twenty-one?

607
00:28:12,671 --> 00:28:16,649
Twenty.

608
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:21,350
That's young.

609
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:26,470
- Is it too young to fuck a thirty year old?

610
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:30,229
Well..

611
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:32,909
You see, Laws are different in different States.

612
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:34,399
Here...

613
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,889
Your Hotel here in Kentucky,
It's frowned upon.

614
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:39,089
But,

615
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:41,830
We go across the bridge in Ohio?

616
00:28:41,831 --> 00:28:42,831
- Oh, where your hotel is.

617
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:47,149
Yeah, surprisingly..they're very laxed
in their Child Endangerment Laws.

618
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:49,089
- Do you have a car?
I don't drive.

619
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:53,790
I took a cab.

620
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,700
- I have the keys to the campaign bus.

621
00:29:02,701 --> 00:29:04,227
<i>TV Reporter:
It fairness this has been tried before.</i>

622
00:29:04,228 --> 00:29:06,803
<i>'Operation Chaos' as Russ Limbaugh called it.</i>

623
00:29:06,804 --> 00:29:09,345
<i>Where, Republicans voted for a Democrat..</i>

624
00:29:09,346 --> 00:29:11,676
<i>they thought they could beat
in the General Election.</i>

625
00:29:11,677 --> 00:29:14,287
<i>We asked Sen.Pullman's campaign manager..</i>

626
00:29:14,288 --> 00:29:17,047
<i>If he's happy the votes of Right-Wingers?</i>

627
00:29:17,048 --> 00:29:18,668
Is it decisive?

628
00:29:18,669 --> 00:29:19,966
No. Of course not.

629
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:23,002
But look, we believe that
the polls are within the margin of error.

630
00:29:23,003 --> 00:29:25,749
And that the..uh Senator
will win Ohio.

631
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:28,461
Yeah, What time is Paul getting in?

632
00:29:28,462 --> 00:29:29,379
Shit.

633
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,909
Who do we talk to about polling?

634
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:36,610
I gotta get some internal polling
at the independents and fucking wing nuts.

635
00:29:36,666 --> 00:29:37,516
- Do you want me to go?

636
00:29:37,517 --> 00:29:38,517
Wait.

637
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,200
What's that guy's name
from The Wall Street Journal?

638
00:29:40,201 --> 00:29:41,329
- You sound busy, I should go.

639
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:44,879
Can you hold on a second,
I'd like to talk to you about something.

640
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,179
Adler? Yeah,
get him on the line.

641
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:49,939
Nobody.
The cleaning lady.

642
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:53,529
Get him on the line..and tell him
we're gonna take the same position we always sat.

643
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:57,649
The race is a lot close than the polling.

644
00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:00,089
No, don't say that. Don't.

645
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:02,439
Just get him on the line,
call me..and I'll take care of it.

646
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,849
I'm sorry.

647
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:05,510
- Cleaning Lady?

648
00:30:05,511 --> 00:30:07,009
Yeah.

649
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:10,899
You called me the cleaning lady.

650
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,549
You're not mad about that, are you?

651
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:13,660
- No, why would i be mad?

652
00:30:13,661 --> 00:30:16,029
Alright.

653
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:20,730
Oh hey! look..

654
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:36,658
Your dad is an asshole.

655
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:39,009
- I'm gonna tell him,
you said that.

656
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:41,359
Yeah, do that.

657
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,519
You wanted to talk to me about something?

658
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,679
Yeah, I just want it to be clear.
I don't want there to be any confusion.

659
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,069
- I'm not gonna tell anybody
about last night.

660
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:51,849
- That'll be great. If we kept it between us.
You know how people are.

661
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,489
Yeah.

662
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:57,159
Really wouldn't look good,
if you screwed an intern.

663
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,969
It's not like that.

664
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:01,961
It's not like i got drunk
and this happened. I like you.

665
00:31:01,962 --> 00:31:04,140
I just don't want there
to be any expectations, you know.

666
00:31:04,141 --> 00:31:05,909
- Steven, you don't have to say anything.

667
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:08,059
Alright.

668
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:10,009
I just don't
want you to think i'm a player.

669
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:14,579
You're kind of a player.

670
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,430
I was being polite.

671
00:31:16,431 --> 00:31:17,431
Bullshit.

672
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,379
You were trying to pick me up.

673
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,480
No, I wasn't.

674
00:31:20,481 --> 00:31:22,919
You're pretty obvious about it.

675
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,850
I was?

676
00:31:23,851 --> 00:31:25,619
Yeah.

677
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,261
I thought,
I was being smooth and subtle.

678
00:31:27,262 --> 00:31:29,699
No, you are pretty forward.

679
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,689
You are pretty forward.
Asking me in a bar.

680
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:32,939
Well,

681
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:36,719
I've been trying to fuck you
for a while.

682
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,119
Wow!

683
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,834
It's kinda slutty of me, huh?

684
00:31:40,835 --> 00:31:42,099
I don't know.

685
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,630
I respected it in a strange way.

686
00:31:43,631 --> 00:31:47,589
Good.

687
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:49,810
You have absolutely no idea,
how to tie a tie are you?

688
00:31:49,811 --> 00:31:53,569
No, no..I don't have a clue.

689
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:56,399
You're very mature.

690
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:01,100
- For a teenager.

691
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,878
When are you coming back?

692
00:32:03,879 --> 00:32:05,899
- I'll be at the event, a little late.

693
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,497
These cocksuckers..
fucking dirty shit!

694
00:32:08,498 --> 00:32:10,471
What happened with Thompson?

695
00:32:10,472 --> 00:32:11,472
- Nothing!

696
00:32:11,473 --> 00:32:14,040
Prick...

697
00:32:14,041 --> 00:32:15,275
sold out motherfucker.

698
00:32:15,276 --> 00:32:19,976
How bad is it?

699
00:32:20,328 --> 00:32:22,098
I don't know.

700
00:32:22,099 --> 00:32:24,261
I just...I'm running the numbers, Paul.

701
00:32:24,262 --> 00:32:27,027
- Alright, I'll be there in three hours.

702
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:30,097
I want hard numbers..
and the strategies.

703
00:32:30,098 --> 00:32:31,098
Yeah, I'm on it.

704
00:32:31,099 --> 00:32:35,799
I gotta go.

705
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,173
You, okay?

706
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:49,912
Yeah, i'm just trying to figure out,
how it stops in the mind.

707
00:32:49,913 --> 00:32:51,289
- The weather will determind that.

708
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:53,349
If we get there.

709
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:55,919
- We're gonna be fine.

710
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,476
We have to do it and...

711
00:32:57,477 --> 00:32:58,477
It's the right thing to do.

712
00:32:58,478 --> 00:33:01,549
And nothing bad happens
when you're doing the right thing.

713
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:05,229
Is this your personal theory?
Cos I can shoot holes in it.

714
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:07,719
Roberta Clemedia on a humanitarian flight.

715
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,399
- Well, there is...

716
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:14,100
There's exceptions to every rule.

717
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:17,109
So, how are you doing?

718
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:19,099
- I think, we are fine now.

719
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:22,379
No, the campaign.
How are we doing?

720
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:25,499
- Oh, Great.

721
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,271
Steven, you are not Paul.

722
00:33:27,272 --> 00:33:28,272
I pay Paul, to use the word 'Great',

723
00:33:28,273 --> 00:33:31,589
I pay you to tell me the truth.

724
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:35,529
- I think that we are solid.

725
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:39,469
Okay, Paul.

726
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:42,669
- Governor, there's a big difference
between Paul and Me.

727
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:46,309
Paul only believes in winning.
So, he'll do or say anything, to win.

728
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:48,019
But, You wouldn't?

729
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:50,579
I'll do or say anything,
to what I believe it in.

730
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:54,369
But, I have to believe in the cause.

731
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:58,419
Oh, you'll make a lousy consultant
when you're out on this line of work.

732
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:01,939
- Well, I won't be out of work in this line,
as long as you are in it, Sir.

733
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:04,629
So, at best you got eight years.

734
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:08,339
And you'll end up with a nice little
consultant firm off Fairgate North.

735
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:10,939
Making 750 grand a year
eating at The Palm..

736
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,829
pimping out ex-senators to..

737
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:14,899
Saudi Princess.

738
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:18,329
- Pimping out ex-presidents.

739
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:21,189
Well, I better win.

740
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:24,259
- Yeah.

741
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,759
Now, I've been married for...

742
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,779
eleven years.

743
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:30,169
We have a normal marriage.

744
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:32,299
Which means,
When we disagree...

745
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:36,469
She wins.

746
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:40,719
But, what we never disagree on is,
How we're gonna leave this planet for our daughter.

747
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,239
Are we gonna leave it,
Better off..

748
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,729
or worse.

749
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:47,859
The riches people in this country,
don't pay their fair share.

750
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:51,359
And when they're asked to,
they cry socialism,

751
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:55,959
they use phrases like,
'redistribution of wealth'.

752
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:00,079
That scares everybody
and they all run and they hide.

753
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,059
For the record,

754
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:06,765
My campaign is vehemently
against the distribution of wealth,

755
00:35:06,766 --> 00:35:09,485
to the riches Americans by our government!

756
00:35:09,486 --> 00:35:14,186
And I will run on that.

757
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:28,775
I met with Tom Duffy, yesterday.

758
00:35:28,776 --> 00:35:30,119
- What?

759
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,049
You were on the plane,
when he called me.

760
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:34,227
And he asked, if we can meet.
I said, Why?

761
00:35:34,228 --> 00:35:37,149
He said, it was very important.
And so, I did.

762
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:39,898
And I should've fucking told you. I'm sorry.
- Stop! Stop!

763
00:35:39,899 --> 00:35:42,003
Let me get this straight.
You met with Tom Duffy?

764
00:35:42,004 --> 00:35:43,609
Yeah.

765
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:46,449
What did he want, Steven?

766
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:48,092
The gist, he wants to hire me.

767
00:35:48,093 --> 00:35:50,043
He wants me to jump ship and
come and work for him.

768
00:35:50,044 --> 00:35:51,437
This is really fucking bad.

769
00:35:51,438 --> 00:35:52,438
He told me that they had poll numbers,

770
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:54,231
that had Pullman ahead by four.

771
00:35:54,232 --> 00:35:57,589
And the big fucking trouble is
he laid out their strategy..

772
00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:01,599
rob all calls, traffic jam,
fake leave and Thompson.

773
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,619
They offered Thompson,
Secretary of State.

774
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,569
You know,
How you fight the war on terror?

775
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:10,004
You don't need their product anymore,
their product is oil,

776
00:36:10,005 --> 00:36:14,705
Just don't need it
and they go away!

777
00:36:14,847 --> 00:36:16,075
We don't have to bomb anyone,

778
00:36:16,076 --> 00:36:20,776
We don't have to
invade anyone!

779
00:36:21,327 --> 00:36:23,849
If this is some kind of
fucking practical...I mean..

780
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:27,441
My fucking blood pressure is going
through the god damn roof, right now.

781
00:36:27,442 --> 00:36:30,589
- Paul, I'm sorry.

782
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:34,029
Believe me.

783
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:36,661
I just didn't think it was true.
- It doesn't matter what you fucking thought!

784
00:36:36,662 --> 00:36:40,339
It matters what you did
and it matters, what you didn't do!

785
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:44,390
Because if all this shit is true?
I made a fucking ass out of myself in Thompson's place..

786
00:36:44,391 --> 00:36:45,699
And I gave away our game plan.

787
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:48,580
- Please believe me that,
I honestly believed that you're gonna come back,

788
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:50,554
And you were gonna tell me that
we have Thompson in the bag.

789
00:36:50,555 --> 00:36:51,959
I didn't see the point.

790
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,899
It doesn't make it right,
and I am sorry!

791
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:57,439
Let me think.

792
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,599
Let me think.

793
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,679
If I am your President..

794
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:05,929
the first thing I'd put in motion is
ten years from the day I take office...

795
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:10,630
No new car in America is run on
an internal combustion engine.

796
00:37:13,016 --> 00:37:16,620
We will create hundreds of thousands
of new jobs. We will start...

797
00:37:16,621 --> 00:37:18,914
the next technological revolution.

798
00:37:18,915 --> 00:37:21,222
And we will lead the world again!

799
00:37:21,223 --> 00:37:25,419
Like we used to.

800
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:28,335
We get the governor
right after he finishes singing kumbayah,

801
00:37:28,336 --> 00:37:31,179
and we give him everything we know.

802
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,985
- Who do you want?
- You, Me and The Governor.

803
00:37:32,986 --> 00:37:34,409
That's it!

804
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:36,429
What's he have, after?

805
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:38,209
- He has a fund raiser...
- We'll be late.

806
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:41,249
We are gonna tell him that
if he doesn't offer Thompson the Cabinet position..

807
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:43,089
He's not gonna get the nomination.

808
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:44,188
- And he's gonna go for it?

809
00:37:44,189 --> 00:37:47,049
Fucking no, Steven.

810
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:51,750
Find us a room.

811
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:41,579
How do we look at the numbers?

812
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,990
We might pick up a few points,
but we loose by 3 or 4 percent.

813
00:38:43,991 --> 00:38:45,309
- Who the fucking knows, governor?

814
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:46,769
But we can't take the chance.

815
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:48,779
What do you think?

816
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:51,008
I think we follow up the campaign in Ohio.

817
00:38:51,009 --> 00:38:54,789
Take a loss, while the republicans
are playing games, head to North Carolina.

818
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,854
I can't run from Ohio,
they'd kill us.

819
00:38:56,855 --> 00:38:58,699
- Not if you get Thompson's endorsement.

820
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,526
I'm not gonna do it.
What does he want?

821
00:39:00,527 --> 00:39:02,469
The FDA or something?

822
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:03,971
- A Cabinet post.

823
00:39:03,972 --> 00:39:05,348
Yeah, what labour?

824
00:39:05,349 --> 00:39:08,559
- State.

825
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,794
Are you fucking kidding me?

826
00:39:09,795 --> 00:39:14,495
I'm gonna give Sec.of State to a guy who wants
to cut the top ten floors off the U.N?

827
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:18,085
Paul, when we started this campaign,
I said I wasn't gonna make those kind of deals...

828
00:39:18,086 --> 00:39:20,869
- Gov. if we loose Ohio and they get
Thompson's delegates..

829
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:25,089
Then they get North Carolina,
Then, they get the lead!

830
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:27,569
A lead we can't beat.

831
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:30,679
But if we walk from Ohio..
take Thompson, give him the fucking cabinet post

832
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,629
then we take North Carolina,

833
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:35,179
His state. Then, Pennsylvania..
your state..

834
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,300
and then, it's simple math..

835
00:39:36,301 --> 00:39:38,519
Mike.

836
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:43,220
Take his endorsement and the race is over.

837
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:48,329
Paul, i respect you.

838
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:51,399
I respect your opinion.

839
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:55,349
I'm never gonna do it.

840
00:39:55,350 --> 00:40:00,050
So, I suggest..
we find a way for me to win Ohio.

841
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,839
Anything else?

842
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:08,229
It's not gonna cut it.
I need to send it.

843
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:10,289
Fuck..Jess,
I gotta call you back.

844
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:11,710
- All of them?
- All of them.

845
00:40:11,711 --> 00:40:12,899
It's killing me!

846
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,322
Here's what i got so far.

847
00:40:14,323 --> 00:40:16,889
Independent's aren't biting
what the republicans are.

848
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:20,487
They're not gonna tell polls
to the devoting Democratics.

849
00:40:20,488 --> 00:40:23,034
- Alright, I also made a call
and i'm gonna get a 100 vans..

850
00:40:23,035 --> 00:40:24,035
out of Covington
and Newport, Kentucky.

851
00:40:24,036 --> 00:40:27,979
We don't need the fucking vans.

852
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:32,680
We were the under-dog before we got into this,
and we continue to be the underdog.

853
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:37,910
Well then...yeah, we always knew the number's
gonna get closer to closer as it get to tuesday.

854
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:43,020
We're not lowering expectations,
have i ever said to you that we had Ohio locked?

855
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:48,630
Well then, at least give me the courtesy
of printing that in the column.

856
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:53,459
What are you writing?

857
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:56,329
- The greatest speech ever given
on hydrogen power.

858
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:58,580
The bar is set awefully high on that one.

859
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:02,859
I know it.

860
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:05,729
I was hit up by Mitchel's wife,

861
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:09,280
for you to show up at her
Daughters of the American Revolution lucheon.

862
00:41:09,281 --> 00:41:11,759
- Who's Mitchel?

863
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,659
Congressman from the first district.

864
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,799
You might wanna remember that.

865
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,339
- Fucking congressman.

866
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:21,640
Can you imagine doing this
every two years?

867
00:41:21,641 --> 00:41:24,369
No, I can't.

868
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:26,849
Let's just do it, one more time.

869
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:28,174
and four more years.

870
00:41:28,175 --> 00:41:29,175
That's it.

871
00:41:29,176 --> 00:41:33,876
- That's a deal.

872
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:39,089
Do you think we'd loose Ohio?

873
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:41,699
- I don't know.

874
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,609
If you took Thompson's delegates.

875
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:45,529
The race would be over.

876
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:50,029
Ohio wouldn't matter.

877
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:53,289
- Is Paul working on you?

878
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:56,789
Steven.

879
00:41:56,790 --> 00:42:01,490
- They're good.

880
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:04,429
Is Thompson so bad?

881
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:05,684
- He is a shit.

882
00:42:05,685 --> 00:42:07,479
Is he worse than Pullman?

883
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:12,180
- Yes, Steven.

884
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:19,280
I will tell them,
i am gonna draw a line on the sand,

885
00:42:19,281 --> 00:42:20,829
then denial.

886
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:24,329
I'm gonna move it.

887
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:27,339
Fund raiser, union deals...
I will do any of it.

888
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:29,839
Negative ads??

889
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:33,163
I can't on this one,

890
00:42:33,164 --> 00:42:37,864
Not, Thompson.

891
00:42:40,463 --> 00:42:44,619
Tell Mrs.Mitchel,
I'll make her God damn luncheon.

892
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:48,159
All they'll do is pat me on the head.

893
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:52,860
- You've got great hair.

894
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:54,589
Gay marriage?

895
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:56,399
- It's a silly argument.

896
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,079
Not to fifty percent of Americans.

897
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,080
- Over the age of fifty.

898
00:42:59,081 --> 00:43:00,081
That's who votes..

899
00:43:00,082 --> 00:43:01,878
That's who shows up at the polls.

900
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:02,879
- Well, that's changed.

901
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:07,580
And hopefully, the way we frame
the argument is as well.

902
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:10,599
But one can argue a great difference...

903
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,299
Between, gender and race.

904
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:15,679
- Not really. We used to ban
inter-racial marriages, women couldn't vote..

905
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:16,909
Paul,

906
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:18,148
the guy from  Procter and Gamble.

907
00:43:18,149 --> 00:43:19,149
- Keep an eye on the governor.

908
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:20,150
Okay.

909
00:43:20,151 --> 00:43:22,729
I don't know what's going on there.

910
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:26,386
Wait, wait...wait.
She's got a point to make.

911
00:43:26,387 --> 00:43:27,387
That's okay, go ahead.

912
00:43:27,388 --> 00:43:31,563
The argument is that man and women
can in fact be considered separate but equal..

913
00:43:31,564 --> 00:43:32,564
races cannot.

914
00:43:32,565 --> 00:43:33,565
- How so?

915
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:36,258
We have separate public bathrooms
for both man and women.

916
00:43:36,259 --> 00:43:39,220
But, it will be illegal
to have separate bathrooms for two races.

917
00:43:39,221 --> 00:43:40,221
Now...

918
00:43:40,222 --> 00:43:44,380
Yes, now.

919
00:43:44,381 --> 00:43:45,740
What time's this hearing?

920
00:43:45,741 --> 00:43:48,030
- Nine O'clock.
- How're we doing?

921
00:43:48,031 --> 00:43:52,731
We're doing good.

922
00:45:40,522 --> 00:45:42,429
Hey, your phone rang.

923
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:46,459
Your phone rang.

924
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:49,478
Who's calling you at 2:30 in the morning?

925
00:45:49,479 --> 00:45:51,009
- I don't know.

926
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:53,349
Hmm? He asked you by name.

927
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:55,260
- You answered it?

928
00:45:55,261 --> 00:45:57,079
I thought, it was my phone.

929
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,713
Who's it?

930
00:45:59,714 --> 00:46:02,019
- I don't know.

931
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:05,251
Is it one of those interns,
drunk dialing it?

932
00:46:05,252 --> 00:46:07,699
- No, that never happens.

933
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:09,010
Let me see the number.

934
00:46:09,011 --> 00:46:10,011
Ohh, boy!

935
00:46:10,012 --> 00:46:11,012
I can't believe it.

936
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:13,014
No..I'm calling him.
- Steven, stop! It's not funny.

937
00:46:13,015 --> 00:46:14,015
I'm saying, I'm your dad.
- Steven, it's not funny,

938
00:46:14,016 --> 00:46:15,359
give me my phone.

939
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,484
Hang up.

940
00:46:16,485 --> 00:46:21,185
Steven, hang up the phone!

941
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:42,580
Why is the governor calling you,
at 2:30 in the morning?

942
00:46:45,379 --> 00:46:49,389
Molly?

943
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:54,090
Why is the governor calling you, at all?

944
00:46:54,913 --> 00:46:59,479
- I'm in trouble.

945
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:02,449
With the governor?

946
00:47:02,450 --> 00:47:07,150
What's going on?

947
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:13,490
- I was working on the campaign in Iowa,

948
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:17,379
there was a party in Ben's room,
after the rally party in Des Moines.

949
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:19,329
There's a party, with You and Ben...

950
00:47:19,330 --> 00:47:22,005
and the governor?

951
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:23,210
- No, he wasn't there.

952
00:47:23,211 --> 00:47:27,069
Where was he?

953
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:31,770
- I took him up a hard copy
of the polling numbers.

954
00:47:32,216 --> 00:47:35,016
After the party?

955
00:47:35,017 --> 00:47:39,069
- It was around mid-night.

956
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:42,515
I just stood,
in the doorway with him.

957
00:47:42,516 --> 00:47:47,216
Just...talking-
for a really long time.

958
00:47:50,136 --> 00:47:54,836
He just reached behind me
and closed the door.

959
00:47:59,681 --> 00:48:04,381
Jesus 'fucking' Christ!

960
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:15,060
Were you drunk?

961
00:48:15,061 --> 00:48:17,419
- Not that drunk.

962
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:19,710
How many times?

963
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:20,739
- It was just that once.

964
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:22,156
Does anybody know?

965
00:48:22,157 --> 00:48:23,157
- No one knows.

966
00:48:23,158 --> 00:48:24,158
Did anybody see you?
- No!

967
00:48:24,159 --> 00:48:25,159
How can you know?

968
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:26,160
I know!

969
00:48:26,161 --> 00:48:27,459
Then, why's he calling you right now?

970
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:30,880
- I called him first.

971
00:48:30,881 --> 00:48:31,506
Why?

972
00:48:31,507 --> 00:48:34,509
- Because I didn't know,
who else to go to.

973
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:39,210
And I needed nine-hundred bucks.

974
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:43,323
For what?

975
00:48:43,324 --> 00:48:48,024
- I can't go to my dad.

976
00:48:48,829 --> 00:48:53,529
We are Catholic.

977
00:49:00,794 --> 00:49:04,304
So..what should I do?

978
00:49:04,305 --> 00:49:09,005
Steven?

979
00:50:30,288 --> 00:50:34,988
What's up?

980
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:38,579
What's our limit on petty cash?

981
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:39,540
- It's about five-hundred.

982
00:50:39,541 --> 00:50:40,541
Why?

983
00:50:40,542 --> 00:50:41,939
I need everything we can get.

984
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:44,119
Is everythign okay?

985
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:45,989
You need help with anything?

986
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:47,430
- Yeah, don't put it in the books.

987
00:50:47,431 --> 00:50:52,131
That's all.

988
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:54,688
- Ohh, what should I put in down instead?

989
00:50:54,689 --> 00:50:55,769
Don't put it down, that's it.

990
00:50:55,770 --> 00:50:58,000
Okay, anything above hundred,
I gotta put it down...

991
00:50:58,001 --> 00:51:02,039
- Just do it!

992
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:06,740
Molly?

993
00:51:27,533 --> 00:51:29,559
<i>'Meet me at the stairwell, at noon'</i>

994
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:32,863
Okay.

995
00:51:32,864 --> 00:51:37,564
I'll take that back.

996
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,879
Yes, Ida?

997
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:06,715
<i>- Stevie, off the record.</i>

998
00:52:06,716 --> 00:52:09,549
No, I cannot tell you,
what happened in North Carolina.

999
00:52:09,550 --> 00:52:12,329
<i>- That's not what I wanted to ask you about.</i>

1000
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:14,281
Okay, what?

1001
00:52:14,282 --> 00:52:18,982
<i>- You met with Duffy.</i>

1002
00:52:19,584 --> 00:52:20,565
Who told you that?

1003
00:52:20,566 --> 00:52:23,381
<i>- A little bird.</i>

1004
00:52:23,382 --> 00:52:24,364
WHO?

1005
00:52:24,365 --> 00:52:27,249
<i>- Did you meet with him?</i>

1006
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:29,809
Where are you?

1007
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:32,742
I know that you met with him in a little bar
in Cinci. two days ago..

1008
00:52:32,743 --> 00:52:34,059
just before the press conference.

1009
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:36,089
Duffy ordered buffalo wings.

1010
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:37,338
Who said that? Duffy?

1011
00:52:37,339 --> 00:52:38,339
- Annonymous.

1012
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:39,849
What happened with Duffy?

1013
00:52:39,850 --> 00:52:41,733
Ida, you're supposed to be my friend..

1014
00:52:41,734 --> 00:52:44,336
Why'd you wanna stickthe fucking knife
at me, on a bullshit story?

1015
00:52:44,337 --> 00:52:45,599
- Is that what you thought,
that we are friends?

1016
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,304
I've given you
anything you've ever wanted.

1017
00:52:47,305 --> 00:52:48,305
Everything. Every story..every scoop..

1018
00:52:48,306 --> 00:52:50,599
You're entire profile with Paul.
- You're right, you've given me a lot.

1019
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:51,885
But, let's get real here Steve.

1020
00:52:51,886 --> 00:52:54,241
The only reason you've ever
treated me well was that I work for The Times.

1021
00:52:54,242 --> 00:52:55,819
Not because i'm your friend.

1022
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:57,805
You give me what i want..
I write you better stories.

1023
00:52:57,806 --> 00:52:59,409
Don't pretend,
it's any more than that.

1024
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:01,389
Why did you meet with Duffy?

1025
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:02,640
- Go fuck yourself!

1026
00:53:02,641 --> 00:53:04,501
Okay..I'll make it easier on you,
forget Duffy.

1027
00:53:04,502 --> 00:53:06,983
What happened in
Paul and Thompson's meeting?

1028
00:53:06,984 --> 00:53:09,449
- Would you keep your voice down?

1029
00:53:09,450 --> 00:53:11,189
Do you have any idea,
what this could do to me?

1030
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:13,230
Of course, I do.
That's why i'm giving you a choice, here.

1031
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:15,929
- I could get fired.

1032
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:18,009
So, it's not a difficult one, Is it?

1033
00:53:18,010 --> 00:53:19,945
I've gotta file my three pm, tomorrow.

1034
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:24,646
You've got till then,
to make up your mind.

1035
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:26,440
You motherfucker!

1036
00:53:26,441 --> 00:53:27,441
<i>- Excuse me?</i>

1037
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:29,160
You leaked it.

1038
00:53:29,161 --> 00:53:30,161
<i>- Leaked, what?</i>

1039
00:53:30,162 --> 00:53:32,299
Don't bullshit me, Tom.

1040
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:34,923
<i>- Bullshit you?
I have no idea what you're talking about.</i>

1041
00:53:34,924 --> 00:53:35,924
I just spoke to Ida Horowicz.

1042
00:53:35,925 --> 00:53:37,339
<i>- Yeah?</i>

1043
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:40,051
She's treatening to release the story.

1044
00:53:40,052 --> 00:53:41,083
<i>- What fucking story?</i>

1045
00:53:41,084 --> 00:53:42,084
That we met.

1046
00:53:42,085 --> 00:53:43,085
That we fucking met!

1047
00:53:43,086 --> 00:53:44,086
<i>- How did she find out?</i>

1048
00:53:44,087 --> 00:53:47,219
Don't..play dumb, Tom.

1049
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:48,690
<i>- You think, I leaked it to her?</i>

1050
00:53:48,691 --> 00:53:49,691
Yeah, who else?

1051
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:51,619
<i>- You know what?
I didn't leaked it to her, Steve.</i>

1052
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:53,232
Well, I know I didn't.
So, that leaves you.

1053
00:53:53,233 --> 00:53:54,233
<i>- Okay.</i>

1054
00:53:54,234 --> 00:53:55,234
<i>What, what does she know?</i>

1055
00:53:55,235 --> 00:53:57,469
She knows whatever you told her.

1056
00:53:57,470 --> 00:54:00,484
<i>- I swear to Jesus,
I did not leaked it to her, Steve.</i>

1057
00:54:00,485 --> 00:54:02,565
<i>I don't want the story out
anymore than you do.</i>

1058
00:54:02,566 --> 00:54:04,802
Well, too late!

1059
00:54:04,803 --> 00:54:06,279
<i>- What did she tell you?</i>

1060
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,692
She know where we met,

1061
00:54:07,693 --> 00:54:08,693
she knows, when we met.

1062
00:54:08,694 --> 00:54:11,291
She knows, you had
fucking buffalo wings..

1063
00:54:11,292 --> 00:54:12,292
<i>- She has a source?</i>

1064
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:13,760
Yeah, she has a source.

1065
00:54:13,761 --> 00:54:16,029
<i>- And, you have no idea,
Who it could be?</i>

1066
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:18,860
Yeah, You!

1067
00:54:18,861 --> 00:54:19,745
<i>- Well, for the record.</i>

1068
00:54:19,746 --> 00:54:22,712
<i>It was not me..
and I didn't have fucking buffalo wings!</i>

1069
00:54:22,713 --> 00:54:24,579
<i>So, it's gotta be someone else.</i>

1070
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:25,580
Did you tell anyone?

1071
00:54:25,581 --> 00:54:26,581
<i>- No. Did you?</i>

1072
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:29,339
No.

1073
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:30,164
<i>- Did you admit to meeting with me?</i>

1074
00:54:30,165 --> 00:54:31,165
No.

1075
00:54:31,166 --> 00:54:32,166
<i>- Alright.</i>

1076
00:54:32,167 --> 00:54:35,309
<i>Then, we stonewall her,
and she's got nothing.</i>

1077
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:37,830
She's gonna take this story to Drudge
or to RollCall...

1078
00:54:37,831 --> 00:54:38,831
or to some shit like that.

1079
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:39,980
<i>- You can't stop her?</i>

1080
00:54:39,981 --> 00:54:44,439
She's trying to blackmail me.
She wants info about Thompson.

1081
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:47,169
<i>- Well then tell her,
what she wants to know.</i>

1082
00:54:47,170 --> 00:54:49,049
I can't do that.

1083
00:54:49,050 --> 00:54:50,710
<i>- You can't let this story get out.</i>

1084
00:54:50,711 --> 00:54:52,349
I'm not gonna be blackmailed, Tom.

1085
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:54,669
<i>- You don't have much choice here, Steve.</i>

1086
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:56,979
If I tell her about Thompson..

1087
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:58,772
I'm gonna have to tell her that,
he's endorsing you.

1088
00:54:58,773 --> 00:54:59,773
<i>- Well, then tell her.</i>

1089
00:54:59,774 --> 00:55:02,150
<i>I can handle it from my side,
if I start getting calls.</i>

1090
00:55:02,151 --> 00:55:03,799
No fucking way!

1091
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:07,159
Paul told her we had Thompson in the bag,
It's gonna make him look like a fucking fool!

1092
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:08,160
<i>- He's gonna look like a fucking fool, anyway. </i>

1093
00:55:08,161 --> 00:55:12,861
<i>When Thompson endorses us.</i>

1094
00:55:17,653 --> 00:55:18,577
I can't do it.

1095
00:55:18,578 --> 00:55:21,771
<i>- You know,
you're on a sinking ship, Steve.</i>

1096
00:55:21,772 --> 00:55:22,772
<i>Tell her what she wants to know.</i>

1097
00:55:22,773 --> 00:55:23,773
<i>And jump.</i>

1098
00:55:23,774 --> 00:55:24,774
<i>Come over to our side.</i>

1099
00:55:24,775 --> 00:55:28,039
<i>We can control this thing,</i>

1100
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:32,740
<i> Steve.
- I gotta go.</i>

1101
00:56:02,290 --> 00:56:05,069
It's almost, eighteen hundred bucks.

1102
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:06,509
You gotta make the appoinment now.

1103
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:07,949
Like, today.

1104
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:10,119
From a pay-phone.

1105
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:12,085
I'll take you to the clinic,
and I'll pick you up.

1106
00:56:12,086 --> 00:56:13,259
But, no one else.

1107
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:14,360
Do you understand?

1108
00:56:14,361 --> 00:56:18,899
- Yeah.

1109
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:21,769
Take the rest of the money
and buy yourself a ticket home.

1110
00:56:21,770 --> 00:56:24,129
You can't be here, anymore.
We can't afford it.

1111
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:28,795
Not with anything,
that's gonna happen next week.

1112
00:56:28,796 --> 00:56:33,496
And the situation,
just can't be here.

1113
00:56:33,650 --> 00:56:35,489
- You mean,
I can't be here?

1114
00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:38,649
Right.

1115
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:42,109
- Steven, I wouldn't tell anyone.

1116
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:44,580
I hope not.

1117
00:56:44,581 --> 00:56:46,549
- Then, Why?

1118
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:49,546
Because, you fucked up.

1119
00:56:49,547 --> 00:56:50,807
- You and I both fucked up.

1120
00:56:50,808 --> 00:56:52,039
That's true.

1121
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:55,149
But, I have a responsibily to him.
And more importantly,

1122
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:57,039
I have a responsibilty to this campaign.

1123
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,374
- I can go to North Carolina
and work on the campaign.

1124
00:56:59,375 --> 00:57:00,833
Molly, you gotta wake the fuck up!

1125
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:01,834
This is the big leagues.

1126
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:03,349
It's mean.

1127
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:07,769
When you make a mistake,
you loose the right to play.

1128
00:57:07,770 --> 00:57:09,549
Make the appoinment.

1129
00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:14,250
Tell me, when and where
we have to go.

1130
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:16,764
Listen to this...

1131
00:57:16,765 --> 00:57:18,520
I got the placement in The Times,

1132
00:57:18,521 --> 00:57:19,521
Bumped to like 600 fucking articles..

1133
00:57:19,522 --> 00:57:22,059
Tom Duffy, 2008.

1134
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:24,889
<i>' This is a match up between,
Hope Versus Fear.</i>

1135
00:57:24,890 --> 00:57:28,399
<i>Nine times out of ten,
the feared candidate have to be the most experienced.</i>

1136
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,261
<i>'But in our presidential races,
the least experienced candidates..</i>

1137
00:57:31,262 --> 00:57:32,262
<i>almost always wins.'</i>

1138
00:57:32,263 --> 00:57:33,263
<i>JFK v/s Nixon.</i>

1139
00:57:33,264 --> 00:57:34,264
<i>Carter v/s Ford</i>

1140
00:57:34,265 --> 00:57:35,265
<i>Bush v/s Gore</i>

1141
00:57:35,266 --> 00:57:39,668
<i>I like our chances
with the new kid on the block'.</i>

1142
00:57:39,669 --> 00:57:41,019
- Thomas fucking Duffy.

1143
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:45,720
He's gotta be having a stroke right now.

1144
00:59:18,919 --> 00:59:22,309
I hate this shit.

1145
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:26,250
I'm gonna come back
and this is all gonna be over.

1146
00:59:26,251 --> 00:59:30,951
- Yeah?

1147
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:50,809
We gotta take a broader stroke here.

1148
00:59:50,810 --> 00:59:54,799
Re-think everything.

1149
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:58,889
Yeah, I know how to handle it.

1150
00:59:58,890 --> 01:00:00,644
Look, Stevie just got here.

1151
01:00:00,645 --> 01:00:03,409
Can I call you back,
in a few minutes?

1152
01:00:03,410 --> 01:00:04,595
Okay, Bye.

1153
01:00:04,596 --> 01:00:05,596
The governor...

1154
01:00:05,597 --> 01:00:08,319
we had a good long talk
on the way back.

1155
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:10,989
He's upto speed with everything.

1156
01:00:10,990 --> 01:00:13,739
How did he take it?

1157
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:16,179
- Better than i thought he would.

1158
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:20,059
Still won't take Thompson's endorsement.

1159
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:22,985
Paul, I gotta tell you something,
I don't know how to tell you.

1160
01:00:22,986 --> 01:00:26,329
- Huh..what's up?

1161
01:00:26,330 --> 01:00:31,030
Ida knows that I met with Duffy.

1162
01:00:34,877 --> 01:00:38,646
I don't know, How she knows.
But, she knows.

1163
01:00:38,647 --> 01:00:43,347
She tried, to blackmaile me.

1164
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:47,282
She said, she's gonna release the story,
Unless I tell her all the details,

1165
01:00:47,283 --> 01:00:51,983
about your meeting with
Thompson.

1166
01:00:53,590 --> 01:00:56,949
So, it's going to end at the papers?

1167
01:00:56,950 --> 01:00:59,509
- Probably.

1168
01:00:59,510 --> 01:01:02,761
And whoever she takes it to,
is gonna call me and ask for statement.

1169
01:01:02,762 --> 01:01:05,056
If I deny the whole thing all together,

1170
01:01:05,057 --> 01:01:07,292
but Duffy admits to it.
It's gonna look even worse,

1171
01:01:07,293 --> 01:01:08,569
And if I just...

1172
01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:13,270
say..No Comment.
They're not gonna let up.

1173
01:01:13,510 --> 01:01:18,210
I..leaked it to Ida.

1174
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:27,670
At the event.

1175
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:29,749
- I don't understand.

1176
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:34,450
We made a deal.

1177
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:39,029
Paul, they are gonna...

1178
01:01:39,030 --> 01:01:41,350
they are gonna print that story
in the paper, tomorrow morning.

1179
01:01:41,351 --> 01:01:43,639
I know.

1180
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:46,579
So, why'd you do it?

1181
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:48,739
Why would you do that to the campaign?

1182
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:53,440
The campaign will survive.

1183
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:56,029
- Why would you do that to me?

1184
01:01:56,030 --> 01:01:59,389
Makes easier to let you go.

1185
01:01:59,390 --> 01:02:01,539
- What?

1186
01:02:01,540 --> 01:02:06,240
Why did you meet with Duffy?

1187
01:02:07,030 --> 01:02:09,160
- I made a Mistake.

1188
01:02:09,161 --> 01:02:10,161
I made a stupid...

1189
01:02:10,162 --> 01:02:11,449
No.

1190
01:02:11,450 --> 01:02:12,310
...Mistake!

1191
01:02:12,311 --> 01:02:15,669
No, Steven. You didn't make a mistake.
You made a choice!

1192
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:18,572
You called me and left a message
to call you back. That it was important.

1193
01:02:18,573 --> 01:02:21,129
And when I did...
you told me to forget about it.

1194
01:02:21,130 --> 01:02:22,479
You choose not to tell me.

1195
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:23,799
Why did you made that choice?

1196
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:26,507
- Because, Paul...
I didn't think it was important.

1197
01:02:26,508 --> 01:02:29,819
Oh, Fuck Yes!
You did.

1198
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:31,470
But, you won't...
B'cos you're curious.

1199
01:02:31,471 --> 01:02:32,471
Because you felt flattered, special.

1200
01:02:32,472 --> 01:02:33,472
Because...

1201
01:02:32,890 --> 01:02:36,209
you felt, special!

1202
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:40,349
To think that, Duffy wants to speak to you,
Instead of me.

1203
01:02:40,350 --> 01:02:42,840
Because, you thought to yourself..
Maybe, I can get something out of this.

1204
01:02:42,841 --> 01:02:47,541
Because..b'cos it made you feel 'Big'?

1205
01:02:49,989 --> 01:02:50,588
You know...

1206
01:02:50,589 --> 01:02:53,999
The first campaign I ran,
was a tiny little race in Kentucky.

1207
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,199
Uh, state senate seat..you know,
working for some red-neck nobody named..

1208
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:00,699
Sam McGuffry.

1209
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:03,429
No staff. No money.
No fucking office.

1210
01:03:03,430 --> 01:03:05,419
Everyone thought,
we didn't stand a chance.

1211
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:07,139
No way, we can compete, right?

1212
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:09,020
And about this time..This guy,

1213
01:03:09,021 --> 01:03:12,469
running this congressional campaign,
a few district over..gives me a call.

1214
01:03:12,470 --> 01:03:17,049
And he says, "I really liked
what you're able to do for poor old Sam."

1215
01:03:17,050 --> 01:03:19,889
"But, let's face it. He's goner.
Why don't you come and work for me"?

1216
01:03:19,890 --> 01:03:21,769
What did I do?

1217
01:03:21,770 --> 01:03:23,419
Well, Steven...

1218
01:03:23,420 --> 01:03:24,981
This is where,
You and I are different.

1219
01:03:24,982 --> 01:03:27,109
I told Sam, about the call.

1220
01:03:27,110 --> 01:03:29,269
And Sam says to me..." Paul,

1221
01:03:29,270 --> 01:03:31,466
If you think this,
other guys got a chance of winning..

1222
01:03:31,467 --> 01:03:33,260
and if he can pay you
more than any I can afford..

1223
01:03:33,261 --> 01:03:34,269
and if it's what you feel..

1224
01:03:34,270 --> 01:03:37,124
You need to do.
Then, I won't get in your way."

1225
01:03:37,125 --> 01:03:38,125
And I say,
"Sam, you took a chance on me,

1226
01:03:38,126 --> 01:03:42,826
and hired me when I was even
more of a nobody than you are".

1227
01:03:44,630 --> 01:03:46,510
So, i'll be damned..
If i was gonna jump ship.

1228
01:03:46,511 --> 01:03:49,559
Just because, the shit hits the fan.

1229
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:51,464
We lost that race.

1230
01:03:51,465 --> 01:03:53,840
But three years later,
When Sam decided to run for Governor..

1231
01:03:53,841 --> 01:03:55,649
Who do you think, he called?

1232
01:03:55,650 --> 01:03:58,328
We won that race,
and 20 years later..I'm where I am.

1233
01:03:58,329 --> 01:04:00,689
Fucking now!

1234
01:04:00,690 --> 01:04:03,019
There's only one thing
I value in this world, Steven.

1235
01:04:03,020 --> 01:04:04,020
That's loyalty.

1236
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:06,209
And without it,
You're nothing!

1237
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:09,269
And you have no one.

1238
01:04:09,270 --> 01:04:11,169
And in politics?

1239
01:04:11,170 --> 01:04:13,509
in fucking politics,

1240
01:04:13,510 --> 01:04:16,629
It's the only currency
you can count on.

1241
01:04:16,630 --> 01:04:19,149
That's why I'm letting you go.

1242
01:04:19,150 --> 01:04:20,785
Not because, you're not good enough.

1243
01:04:20,786 --> 01:04:21,786
Not because, I don't like you.

1244
01:04:21,787 --> 01:04:23,959
But, I value trust over skill.

1245
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:26,239
I don't fucking trust you anymore.

1246
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:29,839
- It doesn't matter whether you trust me, Paul.
It matters if what the governor does.

1247
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:32,129
The governor already knows!

1248
01:04:32,130 --> 01:04:36,369
And he thinks,
it's the right thing to do.

1249
01:04:36,370 --> 01:04:37,879
- He does?

1250
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:39,684
Yeah, and you know what?

1251
01:04:39,685 --> 01:04:40,685
If I were you..

1252
01:04:40,686 --> 01:04:42,109
I'd get a good night sleep.

1253
01:04:42,110 --> 01:04:46,810
B'cos, you're gonna get fucking
pounded by call from the press, in the morning.

1254
01:06:22,830 --> 01:06:25,579
Ben: Hey, where were you today?

1255
01:06:25,580 --> 01:06:27,509
- Uhm,

1256
01:06:27,510 --> 01:06:30,219
i'm not feeling great today, Ben.

1257
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:34,409
You picked a hell of a day,
to call in sick.

1258
01:06:34,410 --> 01:06:35,800
Jesus, it's fucking wild ass there.

1259
01:06:35,801 --> 01:06:37,429
- Why? what happened?

1260
01:06:37,430 --> 01:06:40,579
Steven's off the campaign.

1261
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:43,059
Paul fired him,
some fucking set up about loyalty..

1262
01:06:43,060 --> 01:06:46,119
and it looks like, Steven might've been
doubling down with Duffy, on the Pullman campaign..

1263
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:47,874
I was sitting in the room.

1264
01:06:47,875 --> 01:06:50,945
When Paul told Steven that he's fired.
And Steven said, who's gonna take over...

1265
01:06:50,946 --> 01:06:51,946
and Paul said, Me.

1266
01:06:51,947 --> 01:06:52,947
I know.

1267
01:06:52,948 --> 01:06:53,948
I know, I'm like...

1268
01:06:53,780 --> 01:06:58,175
easy there soldier. But then, Steven goes apeshit,
Paul's giving him speech about loyalty...

1269
01:06:58,176 --> 01:07:00,599
and, and then, shits on Steven
like i've never seen before.

1270
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:02,070
like humiliating shit.

1271
01:07:02,071 --> 01:07:04,819
- When was this?

1272
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:06,359
Molly, listen to me.

1273
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:08,809
I'm gonna run the campaign,
under Paul.

1274
01:07:08,810 --> 01:07:12,659
Steven's going to Duffy,
I..I just jumped three years ahead.

1275
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:14,974
So, starting tomorrow morning..

1276
01:07:14,975 --> 01:07:17,489
we go into full damage control.

1277
01:07:17,490 --> 01:07:18,631
And i'm telling you..

1278
01:07:18,632 --> 01:07:19,709
Steven's going apeshit.

1279
01:07:19,710 --> 01:07:22,247
He said, he's taking everybody down
his way out.

1280
01:07:22,248 --> 01:07:25,600
Morris...Everybody!

1281
01:07:25,601 --> 01:07:26,563
Shit, I gotta take this.

1282
01:07:26,564 --> 01:07:27,638
Do you need anything?

1283
01:07:27,639 --> 01:07:32,339
No.

1284
01:07:53,512 --> 01:07:58,212
Where's Duffy?
- You got an appointment?

1285
01:08:08,390 --> 01:08:09,460
Joe, can we have the room
for a minute?

1286
01:08:09,461 --> 01:08:12,478
Thank you.

1287
01:08:12,479 --> 01:08:13,297
It's not too bright,

1288
01:08:13,298 --> 01:08:17,998
Walking in here like that, Steve.

1289
01:08:20,020 --> 01:08:22,679
I am in.

1290
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:24,789
I'm coming to work for you.

1291
01:08:24,790 --> 01:08:26,899
A reporter from Roll Call was in here,
this afternoon.

1292
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:28,470
- Yeah, i know who leaked it.

1293
01:08:28,471 --> 01:08:29,471
Who?

1294
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:31,764
Paul.
- You told Paul?

1295
01:08:31,765 --> 01:08:32,765
- I told Paul and he leaked it.

1296
01:08:32,766 --> 01:08:35,559
Oh, Steve!

1297
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:37,594
You shouldn't have told him that.

1298
01:08:37,595 --> 01:08:38,904
I felt like i should.

1299
01:08:38,905 --> 01:08:40,735
I've worked with Paul.
He gets paranoid.

1300
01:08:40,736 --> 01:08:41,736
- Obviously.

1301
01:08:41,737 --> 01:08:42,737
So, he fired you?

1302
01:08:42,630 --> 01:08:45,289
- I quit.
- No, you're lying to me.

1303
01:08:45,290 --> 01:08:46,936
Come on, man.
- I quit!

1304
01:08:46,937 --> 01:08:48,099
I'm gonna give you everything!

1305
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:51,163
I'm gonna give you his whole strategy,
I'm gonna give you all...

1306
01:08:51,164 --> 01:08:52,164
I don't need his whole strategy.
I already have it.

1307
01:08:52,165 --> 01:08:55,119
Paul gave it all to Thompson.

1308
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:57,619
- What if I had something else?

1309
01:08:57,620 --> 01:09:00,580
You would do that to Morris,
To Paul?

1310
01:09:00,581 --> 01:09:01,922
- Yeah.
- I don't know.

1311
01:09:01,923 --> 01:09:04,049
Revenge makes people unpredictable,

1312
01:09:04,050 --> 01:09:06,701
Steve,  I can't have someone
who's unpredictable, who's unstable.

1313
01:09:06,702 --> 01:09:08,869
I'm not unstable.

1314
01:09:08,870 --> 01:09:10,484
If you had left Morris,

1315
01:09:10,485 --> 01:09:14,889
before the story broke..
that'd be one thing. That we could control.

1316
01:09:14,890 --> 01:09:16,140
But, like this?

1317
01:09:16,141 --> 01:09:18,676
Paul fires you...
and then, you wanna come work for me...

1318
01:09:18,677 --> 01:09:22,866
It makes me look like, I'm picking up the scrapes.
It puts Morris in the driver seat.

1319
01:09:22,867 --> 01:09:23,867
I can't have that.

1320
01:09:23,790 --> 01:09:26,854
- What If, I had something big?

1321
01:09:26,855 --> 01:09:31,555
Like, what?

1322
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:34,529
- Something Big.

1323
01:09:34,530 --> 01:09:37,669
Something that'll put Morris down.

1324
01:09:37,670 --> 01:09:41,289
What is it?

1325
01:09:41,290 --> 01:09:45,990
- Give me the job.

1326
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:48,950
No. That's not gonna happen.

1327
01:09:48,951 --> 01:09:50,729
I'm sorry.

1328
01:09:50,730 --> 01:09:53,113
Go take a nice long vacation.

1329
01:09:53,114 --> 01:09:54,269
You're a smart guy.

1330
01:09:54,270 --> 01:09:57,999
Everything that I said,
the other day is absolutely true.

1331
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:58,930
But..you know?

1332
01:09:58,931 --> 01:10:01,809
Maybe, politics isn't for you.

1333
01:10:01,810 --> 01:10:03,959
- Politics is my life!

1334
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:04,772
Oh, you know what?

1335
01:10:04,773 --> 01:10:05,773
Do yourself a favour.
Get out..

1336
01:10:05,774 --> 01:10:06,774
Now!

1337
01:10:06,430 --> 01:10:08,749
While you still can.

1338
01:10:08,750 --> 01:10:11,102
G..go into entertainment or business.

1339
01:10:11,103 --> 01:10:13,313
Go open a fucking restaurant
in Costa Rica.

1340
01:10:13,314 --> 01:10:14,242
Anything!

1341
01:10:14,243 --> 01:10:17,169
Do something that's
gonna make you happy..Okay?

1342
01:10:17,170 --> 01:10:18,904
Cos if you stay in this business
long enough,

1343
01:10:18,905 --> 01:10:19,905
You're gonna get jaded and cynical.

1344
01:10:19,906 --> 01:10:20,906
- Like you?

1345
01:10:20,907 --> 01:10:24,629
Yeah, just like me!

1346
01:10:24,630 --> 01:10:28,685
- You knew I was gonna fucking tell Paul.
Didn't you?

1347
01:10:28,686 --> 01:10:29,721
No, I didn't know.

1348
01:10:29,722 --> 01:10:32,089
I thought, you might.
But, I didn't know.

1349
01:10:32,090 --> 01:10:36,063
- You knew I was gonna tell him, you knew..
and you knew that he's gonna fucking fire me.

1350
01:10:36,064 --> 01:10:37,187
Well, that's the thing about Paul.

1351
01:10:37,188 --> 01:10:38,188
He's big on loyalty.

1352
01:10:38,189 --> 01:10:42,889
- Yeah, I know.
I just got a big speech on it.

1353
01:10:43,420 --> 01:10:45,589
You were never gonna hire me?

1354
01:10:45,590 --> 01:10:49,339
Put yourself on my shoes, Steve.

1355
01:10:49,340 --> 01:10:51,490
You're opponent has the best
media mind in the country...

1356
01:10:51,491 --> 01:10:53,358
Working for his team.

1357
01:10:53,359 --> 01:10:56,359
What are you gonna do?

1358
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:58,520
You're either gonna hire him
for yourself...

1359
01:10:58,521 --> 01:10:59,521
Or you're either gonna work it,
so, you can't have him?

1360
01:10:59,522 --> 01:11:02,829
The other team can't either.

1361
01:11:02,830 --> 01:11:06,739
This is a Win-win situation for me.

1362
01:11:06,740 --> 01:11:08,741
And you come work for me, great!

1363
01:11:08,742 --> 01:11:10,559
Paul doesn't have you.

1364
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:11,540
But, then again..

1365
01:11:11,541 --> 01:11:13,449
Paul fires you,
I don't want you...fine.

1366
01:11:13,450 --> 01:11:15,749
Paul still doesn't have you.

1367
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:18,209
Either way, I win.

1368
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:22,269
and the moment,
I got you sit down on that chair...

1369
01:11:22,270 --> 01:11:23,940
I know, I've won.

1370
01:11:23,941 --> 01:11:25,699
- This is...

1371
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:28,149
It's my life,
that you're talking about.

1372
01:11:28,150 --> 01:11:30,360
It doesn't make me happy,
doing this kind of thing.

1373
01:11:30,361 --> 01:11:32,639
Don't think,
it gives me any kind of pleasure.

1374
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:37,340
No, I'm sorry for you.
I really am.

1375
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:43,700
Take care of yourself.

1376
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:51,980
Do you know her?

1377
01:12:54,371 --> 01:12:59,071
She is gone.

1378
01:13:56,199 --> 01:13:57,493
<i>Molly on phone:

1379
01:13:57,494 --> 01:14:02,194
<i>It's four something..
they're gonna close up in few minutes.</i>

1381
01:14:05,607 --> 01:14:06,855
<i>Listen, What the fuck?</i>

1382
01:14:06,856 --> 01:14:11,556
<i>Jesus...what're you gonna do?</i>

1383
01:14:12,910 --> 01:14:16,491
<i>Steven, uh..
I just heard from Ben.</i>

1384
01:14:16,492 --> 01:14:18,302
<i>Please...don't do anything fucked up.</i>

1385
01:14:18,303 --> 01:14:20,209
<i>God damn it!
You motherfucker,</i>

1386
01:14:20,210 --> 01:14:21,413
<i>Pick up the phone!</i>

1387
01:14:21,414 --> 01:14:26,114
<i>Don't do this!</i>

1388
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:31,900
<i>I'm not going away.</i>

<i>That this was an accidental overdose.</i>

1391
01:14:40,794 --> 01:14:44,063
<i>A lethal cocktail

I want on the ticket,

1397
01:15:25,380 --> 01:15:30,080
You need me on that ticket,
and you could use my delegates.

1398
01:15:30,410 --> 01:15:32,889
And you need them
before tuesday.

1399
01:15:32,890 --> 01:15:36,129
It'll make a fine story,
on the sunday morning news cycle.

1400
01:15:36,130 --> 01:15:39,789
So, I expect to hear from you,
by noon tomorrow.

1401
01:15:39,790 --> 01:15:44,490
Or I endorse Pullman
and take that Cabinet seat.

1402
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:55,380
Anything else,
you wanna talk about, Steven?

1403
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:11,279
The entire staff is...

1404
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:13,889
in the state of shock.

1405
01:16:13,890 --> 01:16:18,180
We send our condolences
to Jack and Joanna Sterns and their entire family.

1406
01:16:18,181 --> 01:16:20,726
Of course, our hearts go out to them.

1407
01:16:20,727 --> 01:16:24,229
It's hard to imagine,
what they must be going through.

1408
01:16:24,230 --> 01:16:26,899
What we know right now is that,
it appears to have been..

1409
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:29,579
a drug..an accidental

1410
01:16:29,580 --> 01:16:33,305
prescription overdose.

We have no reason to believe...

1413
01:16:36,830 --> 01:16:38,714
I don't think we have any
information on that yet.

1414
01:16:38,715 --> 01:16:40,821
Obviously, there'll be a full investigation.

1415
01:16:40,822 --> 01:16:43,649
We just wanted to say that,
our hearts go out...

Our prayers go out...

1417

to the entire family.

1418
01:16:47,140 --> 01:16:51,618
She really is...
she was part of our family.

<i>Did you know her well, Governor?</i>

1420

Not well..
But I did know her.

1421
01:16:54,711 --> 01:16:57,519
What I saw was a
hard working young woman with a..

1422
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:00,469
great spirit.

1423
01:17:00,470 --> 01:17:04,003
It's just a sad day,
for the campaign.

1424
01:17:04,004 --> 01:17:06,317
And it's a sad day
for those of us who knows Jack.

<i>- Governor,
how long has she interned for you?</i>

1426
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:18,209
She'd only been on the road
with us for a few weeks.

1427
01:17:18,210 --> 01:17:20,339
Maybe, four weeks..I think.

1428
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:21,662
I can check.

1429
01:17:21,663 --> 01:17:26,363
<i>- Will you be continuing
with your schedule today?</i>

1430
01:18:55,520 --> 01:19:00,220
Seems like you have something
you wanna talk to me about.

1431
01:19:00,940 --> 01:19:05,640
- Does it seem that way?

1432
01:19:06,460 --> 01:19:09,610
You have something,
you think you have something..

1433
01:19:09,611 --> 01:19:12,229
you wanna get off your chest.
Why don't you?

1434
01:19:12,230 --> 01:19:16,930
- How about, I do the talking.
And you do the listening?

1435
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:19,539
Okay.

1436
01:19:19,540 --> 01:19:23,148
- As of tomorrow, there's gonna
be a few changes to your campaign.

1437
01:19:23,149 --> 01:19:25,311
Paul is out.

1438
01:19:25,312 --> 01:19:28,049
I am your Senior Campaign Manager.

1439
01:19:28,050 --> 01:19:30,219
I'll draft the statement..

1440
01:19:30,220 --> 01:19:33,178
The campaign got to a point
that we need to make some changes.

1441
01:19:33,179 --> 01:19:34,887
You can put your own words in there.

1442
01:19:34,888 --> 01:19:36,499
Why would I do that?

1443
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:39,759
- Because, you wanna win.

1444
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:42,371
Because, you broke the only rule
in politics.

1445
01:19:42,372 --> 01:19:44,119
You wanna be President...

1446
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:45,319
You can start a war...

1447
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:47,169
You can lie,
You can cheat...

1448
01:19:47,170 --> 01:19:48,734
You can bankrupt the country...

1449
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:52,459
but you can't fuck the interns.

1450
01:19:52,460 --> 01:19:56,519
They'll get you for that.

1451
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:59,529
What do you think you have, Steven?

1452
01:19:59,530 --> 01:20:01,412
A troubled young girl,
tells you a story...?

1453
01:20:01,413 --> 01:20:03,289
- A troubled young  pregnant girl...

1454
01:20:03,290 --> 01:20:04,383
Is that what she told you?

1455
01:20:04,384 --> 01:20:06,301
- ...who needed cash for an abortion!

1456
01:20:06,302 --> 01:20:07,889
What did you do?
You gave her money?

1457
01:20:07,890 --> 01:20:11,449
Maybe, she just needed cash.
And you're the perfect guy to hit up.

1458
01:20:11,450 --> 01:20:12,765
- Is that your best play?

1459
01:20:12,766 --> 01:20:14,532
You need a job, that bad Steven?

1460
01:20:14,533 --> 01:20:16,289
You coming here,
with your dick in your hand...

1461
01:20:16,290 --> 01:20:17,290
You got nothing!

1462
01:20:16,970 --> 01:20:20,509
- Then, how did I get in here?

1463
01:20:20,510 --> 01:20:22,132
You're right Mike.
There's nothing...

1464
01:20:22,133 --> 01:20:23,133
there's no voice messages..

1465
01:20:23,134 --> 01:20:25,088
no text..no e-mails...

1466
01:20:25,089 --> 01:20:27,699
no pictures and no tape.
And yet...

1467
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:29,599
I'm standing right here.

1468
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:32,259
Well, go home.

1469
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:36,960
She left a note.

1470
01:20:42,260 --> 01:20:43,949
How would you know that?

1471
01:20:43,950 --> 01:20:46,599
- I was cleaning up your mess.

1472
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:49,739
I took her phone,
and I found a note.

1473
01:20:49,740 --> 01:20:51,789
I thought it was an accident.

1474
01:20:51,790 --> 01:20:52,706
- I don't know, Mike.

1475
01:20:52,707 --> 01:20:53,707
You're gonna have to tell me..

1476
01:20:53,708 --> 01:20:57,179
You're the last person she called.

1477
01:20:57,180 --> 01:20:59,114
Note says, she is pregnant.

1478
01:20:59,115 --> 01:21:00,115
Got an abortion...

1479
01:21:00,116 --> 01:21:03,219
and doesn't wanna hurt you.

1480
01:21:03,220 --> 01:21:06,275
Then why would she leave
a note, that can only do that?

1481
01:21:06,276 --> 01:21:10,809
- She's twenty.

1482
01:21:10,810 --> 01:21:12,036
What do you want?

1483
01:21:12,037 --> 01:21:15,609
- Paul's gone...today.

1484
01:21:15,610 --> 01:21:18,819
I set a meeting with You and Thompson,
and you promise him the ticket.

1485
01:21:18,820 --> 01:21:21,129
You get 356 pledged delegates...

1486
01:21:21,130 --> 01:21:24,319
You get North Carolina..
You take office...

1487
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:26,949
You make right with so many people
that you've made wrong.

1488
01:21:26,950 --> 01:21:29,449
All the things that we both believe in.

1489
01:21:29,450 --> 01:21:32,707
I don't believe in extortion..
I don't believe in tying myself to you...

1490
01:21:32,708 --> 01:21:33,779
for the next eight years!

1491
01:21:33,780 --> 01:21:38,480
- Four years.
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

1492
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:46,449
What were you doing in her room?

1493
01:21:46,450 --> 01:21:48,969
- House keeping,
before you make page one.

1494
01:21:48,970 --> 01:21:50,421
No, you were fired,
You were out.

1495
01:21:50,422 --> 01:21:52,119
What were you doing in her room?

1496
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:54,989
- I was fixing the situation.

1497
01:21:54,990 --> 01:21:57,489
I got a call,  someone
from the hotel thought I could help...

1498
01:21:57,490 --> 01:21:58,275
and they called me.

1499
01:21:58,276 --> 01:21:59,276
So, you're off the campaign,

1500
01:21:59,277 --> 01:22:00,277
But you thought it was important..

1501
01:22:00,278 --> 01:22:04,978
...to fix things!

1502
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:12,696
It was your voice,
the other night on the phone.

1503
01:22:12,697 --> 01:22:14,749
You were fucking her.

1504
01:22:14,750 --> 01:22:19,450
What did you do, Steven?

1505
01:22:19,690 --> 01:22:21,260
- I lend her some money
and I gave her a ride.

1506
01:22:21,261 --> 01:22:24,729
I bet you did.

1507
01:22:24,730 --> 01:22:27,569
There's no note.

1508
01:22:27,570 --> 01:22:29,020
- Okay, Mike.
There's no note.

1509
01:22:29,021 --> 01:22:30,021
Show it to me.

1510
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:31,879
- You think I brought it here?

1511
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:36,580
That's how people get hurt.

1512
01:22:42,616 --> 01:22:43,333
Okay.

1513
01:22:43,334 --> 01:22:45,609
Let's play this out.

1514
01:22:45,610 --> 01:22:49,930
You're not wearing a wire,
because everything you've suggested is illegal.

1515
01:22:49,931 --> 01:22:53,479
And you wouldn't fare
too well, in federal prison.

1516
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:56,909
You were fucking her
and she told you about her situation.

1517
01:22:56,910 --> 01:22:59,647
There are no records or
conversation between the two of us.

1518
01:22:59,648 --> 01:23:00,859
And since, she's had abortion...

1519
01:23:00,860 --> 01:23:03,759
There's no DNA evidence.

1520
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:07,029
So, there's no note.

1521
01:23:07,030 --> 01:23:11,039
It's word against mine.

1522
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:13,649
Your word.

1523
01:23:13,650 --> 01:23:17,179
A fired, disgruntled employee..

1524
01:23:17,180 --> 01:23:21,880
or a sitting governor.

1525
01:23:23,770 --> 01:23:28,470
There's no note.

1526
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:34,140
- It's your call, Governor.

1527
01:24:23,678 --> 01:24:28,378
Paul, you got a minute?
- Yeah.

1528
01:25:24,030 --> 01:25:25,297
<i>TV Reporter:
How much could a shake up like this..</i>

1529
01:25:25,298 --> 01:25:28,766
<i>days before the Ohio primary,
Hurt a campaign?</i>

1530
01:25:28,767 --> 01:25:31,814
<i>I asked Paul Zara, How his
firing could actually help the candidate?</i>

1531
01:25:31,815 --> 01:25:35,921
- The governor and I both,
felt that in light of this changing numbers,

1532
01:25:35,922 --> 01:25:38,206
that it was best to put a new face
on the campaign..

1533
01:25:38,207 --> 01:25:39,207
Steven is very talented.

1534
01:25:39,208 --> 01:25:43,908
Very smart.

1535
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:58,329
You always hear people talk about,

1536
01:25:58,330 --> 01:26:00,879
Events out of sequence...

1537
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:05,580
the order of things.

1538
01:26:07,990 --> 01:26:14,435
There's no greater grief,
than a parent laying a child during this.

1539
01:26:18,290 --> 01:26:20,559
She was a little girl...

1540
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:23,659
trying to make it in a very grown up world.

1541
01:26:23,660 --> 01:26:26,879
A world where,
every mistake is magnified.

1542
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:28,919
And she was smart and pretty..

1543
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:33,620
and so, so young.

1544
01:26:35,700 --> 01:26:38,775
Father, you asked us
to accept God's plan..

1545
01:26:38,776 --> 01:26:41,219
and to not question his judgement.

1546
01:26:41,220 --> 01:26:43,179
With all due respect,

1547
01:26:43,180 --> 01:26:46,429
I don't accept to this judgement.

1548
01:26:46,430 --> 01:26:51,130
She made the world better!

1549
01:26:51,662 --> 01:26:54,449
Not just for me.

1550
01:26:54,450 --> 01:26:59,150
But for everyone she touched.

1551
01:27:10,490 --> 01:27:13,229
You should hire Jack
for a speech writer.

1552
01:27:13,230 --> 01:27:17,549
- I'll keep it in mind.

1553
01:27:17,550 --> 01:27:19,549
You come here to see me?

1554
01:27:19,550 --> 01:27:22,169
No, friends of the family.

1555
01:27:22,170 --> 01:27:26,291
I got her the internship.

1556
01:27:26,292 --> 01:27:29,601
I've known her since
she was born.

1557
01:27:29,602 --> 01:27:33,559
- Sorry.

1558
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:36,579
The governor couldn't make the flight?

1559
01:27:36,580 --> 01:27:40,064
- He's meeting with Thompson.

1560
01:27:40,065 --> 01:27:41,549
Look at you.

1561
01:27:41,550 --> 01:27:46,039
All grown up with
tits and all.

1562
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:50,740
- I learned from the best.

1563
01:27:51,710 --> 01:27:54,929
Well, one day we'll grab a beer and...

1564
01:27:54,930 --> 01:27:58,179
you could tell me, what you had
on the governor that put me out.

1565
01:27:58,180 --> 01:28:02,880
- How do you know
I didn't have something on you?

1566
01:28:07,660 --> 01:28:09,269
You better get going..

1567
01:28:09,270 --> 01:28:12,199
You have a campaign to run
and I've got offices to look at.

1568
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:15,629
- North?

1569
01:28:15,630 --> 01:28:18,939
Nice consulting firm,
out of K street.

1570
01:28:18,940 --> 01:28:21,379
A million a year.

1571
01:28:21,380 --> 01:28:24,039
No one to fuck you over.

1572
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:26,170
- Sounds relaxing.

1573
01:28:26,171 --> 01:28:30,871
Doesn't it?

1574
01:28:32,570 --> 01:28:36,450
<i>Thompson: The right man to lead
this nation of ours.</i>

1575
01:28:36,451 --> 01:28:37,529
<i>In this chanllenging times...</i>

1576
01:28:37,530 --> 01:28:39,069
<i>and..</i>

1577
01:28:39,070 --> 01:28:40,869
<i>and the next President..</i>

1578
01:28:40,870 --> 01:28:43,369
of The United States of America...

1579
01:28:43,370 --> 01:28:48,070
Governor Mike Morris!

1580
01:28:52,810 --> 01:28:56,499
<i>And let me ask,
one very important thing.</i>

1581
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:59,035
<i>That all of us stand,
shoulder to shoulder...</i>

1582
01:28:59,036 --> 01:29:03,736
<i>arm and arm,
in a united democrat party...</i>

1583
01:29:05,030 --> 01:29:08,397
<i>So, I strongly urge
the three hundred and fifty six</i>

1584
01:29:08,398 --> 01:29:11,579
<i>loyal delegates that I've
carried as a badge of honour...</i>

1585
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:15,722
<i>Throw their support to the governor,
lets put this primary behind us...</i>

1586
01:29:15,723 --> 01:29:19,745
<i>And get on with the business
of sixteen hundred Pennsylvania Avenue!</i>

1587
01:29:19,746 --> 01:29:24,446
<i>Thank you, God bless you..
and God Bless The United States of America!</i>

1588
01:29:35,970 --> 01:29:39,689
Thank you.

1589
01:29:39,690 --> 01:29:41,839
Well, the polls aren't quite closed.

1590
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:46,069
But I do wanna congratulate
Senator Pullman and his republican constituents,

1591
01:29:46,070 --> 01:29:50,770
on their win here in Ohio.

1592
01:29:55,504 --> 01:29:58,419
Senator Thompson,
I'm honoured to stand with you here today.

1593
01:29:58,420 --> 01:30:01,474
And I'm humbled
by your kind words.

1594
01:30:01,475 --> 01:30:03,949
Thank you.

1595
01:30:03,950 --> 01:30:06,749
Ladies and Gentlement, today
marks the begining of the fight between...

1596
01:30:06,750 --> 01:30:09,099
Two sets of ideals.

1597
01:30:09,100 --> 01:30:13,800
Either we're gonna move forward or
we're going to live in the past?

1598
01:30:13,937 --> 01:30:17,754
Either we're going to lead the world
again on technology or we are going to bury,

1599
01:30:17,755 --> 01:30:21,175
our heads in the sands?

1600
01:30:21,176 --> 01:30:25,876
The sands of Saudi Arabia.
The sands of Iraq?

1601
01:30:27,020 --> 01:30:29,519
Either we are going to let
Greed and corruption

1602
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:32,369
ruin our industries and our shorelines..

1603
01:30:32,370 --> 01:30:37,070
or we are going
to take back our country?

1604
01:30:37,307 --> 01:30:40,100
We are not a nation
used to come in second...

1605
01:30:40,101 --> 01:30:44,801
or third???

1606
01:31:08,030 --> 01:31:10,749
Hey, Ben?

1607
01:31:10,750 --> 01:31:14,339
I was told to talk to you,
I'm suppose to get a phone.

1608
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:15,691
And you are?

1609
01:31:15,692 --> 01:31:16,692
- Joe Morris.

1610
01:31:16,693 --> 01:31:19,019
No relation.

1611
01:31:19,020 --> 01:31:20,700
You're a Beercat Joe Morris?

1612
01:31:20,701 --> 01:31:25,401
- No, i'm from Columbus,
I'm a Buckeye.

1613
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:41,550
You're making me look bad.

1614
01:31:41,551 --> 01:31:43,779
- How so?

1615
01:31:43,780 --> 01:31:45,949
I filed the story that said you're
off the campaign..

1616
01:31:45,950 --> 01:31:48,489
And Thompson is going to Pullman.

1617
01:31:48,490 --> 01:31:51,339
You can't believe
everything you read.

1618
01:31:51,340 --> 01:31:54,779
I just wanna give you
an opportunity to comment on my next story.

1619
01:31:54,780 --> 01:31:56,436
Says you delivered Thompson.

1620
01:31:56,437 --> 01:31:58,446
You got that 356 delegates,

1621
01:31:58,447 --> 01:32:01,809
you delivered the nomination.
And all you ask in return is Paul's job.

1622
01:32:01,810 --> 01:32:03,709
Any chance of you confirming now?
- No press behind this point.

1623
01:32:03,710 --> 01:32:04,710
She's press.

1624
01:32:04,711 --> 01:32:05,711
I'll read about it
in the funny papers.

1625
01:32:05,712 --> 01:32:08,012
Come on, Steven?

1626
01:32:08,013 --> 01:32:12,713
Aren't we friends anymore?

1627
01:32:13,379 --> 01:32:18,079
You are my best friend, Ida.

1628
01:34:38,874 --> 01:34:43,574
