1
00:01:43,354 --> 00:01:45,398
This is J. T.L. Morning News.

2
00:01:45,482 --> 00:01:47,442
This is Holly Chadwick.

3
00:01:47,525 --> 00:01:48,651
Thanks for joining us.

4
00:01:48,735 --> 00:01:51,404
We have a great show
in store for you this morning.

5
00:01:51,488 --> 00:01:54,115
Well, it's a great morning
to be in the studio.

6
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:56,409
Authorities have confirmed
an avian flu outbreak.

7
00:01:56,493 --> 00:01:57,827
Forecast, cloudy skies...

8
00:01:57,911 --> 00:01:59,913
Good morning. Reporting from Brighton.

9
00:02:01,331 --> 00:02:03,041
This will be a different scenario

10
00:02:03,124 --> 00:02:06,461
if the virus changes in a way that allows
transmission between humans.

11
00:02:06,544 --> 00:02:07,629
So, let's get started.

12
00:02:09,798 --> 00:02:10,924
Yet again today,

13
00:02:11,007 --> 00:02:14,052
another group of dolphins
became stranded.

14
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,055
CO2 emissions have
dramatically increased in...

15
00:02:17,222 --> 00:02:19,140
Are there any
real threats that you know of?

16
00:02:19,224 --> 00:02:20,433
Not at all.

17
00:02:21,017 --> 00:02:22,185
Environmentalists are trying

18
00:02:22,268 --> 00:02:23,686
to determine the cause of death.

19
00:02:23,812 --> 00:02:25,480
At alert level six,

20
00:02:25,563 --> 00:02:27,649
W H. O. guidelines for governments...

21
00:02:27,732 --> 00:02:30,026
Your socks are so cute! I like them.

22
00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:31,569
Police say they've seen
similar cases recently

23
00:02:32,111 --> 00:02:33,696
of people behaving strangely.

24
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,157
The U. N. health agency is not likely

25
00:02:36,241 --> 00:02:38,660
to recommend official travel restrictions.

26
00:02:38,743 --> 00:02:40,453
It's a little bit unsettling.

27
00:02:40,537 --> 00:02:42,997
They're not physicists.
They're not engineers.

28
00:02:43,081 --> 00:02:44,374
They think it's just gonna go away.

29
00:02:44,457 --> 00:02:45,917
They live in a fantasy parallel universe.

30
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:49,587
Right on top of the man, beating him.

31
00:02:49,671 --> 00:02:50,839
The man is bleeding.

32
00:02:50,922 --> 00:02:52,257
Twenty-one confirmed cases.

33
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,635
All the talk
about a doomsday is a big hoax.

34
00:02:55,802 --> 00:02:57,136
The subject growled at him

35
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,222
and continued to maul the victim.

36
00:02:59,305 --> 00:03:02,642
The best estimate
is about 15,000 in the U. K.

37
00:03:02,767 --> 00:03:04,018
We don't know if this is spreading.

38
00:03:04,102 --> 00:03:05,436
Rhythms of change...

39
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,522
So far there's no manifestation.

40
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:13,570
Monitors have arrived,
even carrying them...

41
00:03:13,736 --> 00:03:14,863
With that much
public at risk, we cannot...

42
00:03:14,946 --> 00:03:17,949
They're trying to move us on,
trying to tell the journalists to get out.

43
00:03:34,132 --> 00:03:35,300
Wake up!

44
00:03:36,134 --> 00:03:38,928
Oh, creatures in our bed...

45
00:03:40,555 --> 00:03:41,681
No sleeping!

46
00:03:43,016 --> 00:03:44,559
Oh, you're getting very big.

47
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:47,562
- What do you want to eat?
- Pancakes!

48
00:03:48,605 --> 00:03:49,981
We got a lot more sunshine today.

49
00:03:50,148 --> 00:03:52,483
You have to only say one word.

50
00:03:52,984 --> 00:03:55,153
Hey, by the way,
what do you want for your birthday?

51
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:56,404
Say a Puppy-

52
00:03:56,529 --> 00:03:57,572
A PUPPY-

53
00:03:57,655 --> 00:03:59,407
You mean a stuffed animal puppy?

54
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:00,992
Because that we can do.

55
00:04:03,995 --> 00:04:06,164
Good morning. That looks yummy.

56
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,708
She gets the bigger one?

57
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,418
- Yeah, sorry.
- She's tiny.

58
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:12,378
Did you pack your inhaler?

59
00:04:13,546 --> 00:04:14,672
Bathroom sink.

60
00:04:14,756 --> 00:04:17,091
- In a minute?
-Scootch! Go.

61
00:04:17,717 --> 00:04:19,761
The government
has declared martial law.

62
00:04:19,844 --> 00:04:21,596
Daddy, what's martial law?

63
00:04:23,723 --> 00:04:27,185
Martial law is like house rules,
but for everybody.

64
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:31,564
Were you ever
in places like that with your old job?

65
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:35,652
But I quit my old job
so I could be with you.

66
00:04:35,902 --> 00:04:36,945
Do you miss it?

67
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,408
No, I like my new job.

68
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:45,203
All you do is make pancakes
in the morning!

69
00:04:45,328 --> 00:04:46,537
Yeah, but I'm really good at it.

70
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:48,414
Look who I found!

71
00:04:48,998 --> 00:04:50,333
Here comes the number 12 train!

72
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:51,751
It's not Subway Sam, is it?

73
00:04:52,335 --> 00:04:54,545
You want more pancakes?

74
00:04:55,171 --> 00:04:56,506
Good.

75
00:04:56,673 --> 00:04:58,967
Go, go, go. Come on, scootch!

76
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,802
- At least. ..
- Move it on out.

77
00:05:00,885 --> 00:05:02,762
Hey! Plates in the sink!

78
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:04,013
- Later!
- Do that when we get back!

79
00:05:11,396 --> 00:05:13,356
Does it live in the jungle?

80
00:05:16,442 --> 00:05:17,443
No.

81
00:05:17,527 --> 00:05:18,820
Do you eat it on Sundays?

82
00:05:18,903 --> 00:05:19,946
No.

83
00:05:20,071 --> 00:05:22,907
Does it live
on the Great Plains of Africa?

84
00:05:23,408 --> 00:05:25,535
- Yeah.
- Oh, well, I guess, yeah.

85
00:05:25,618 --> 00:05:28,913
Do people keep it in pens all its
life and harvest it for meat?

86
00:05:28,997 --> 00:05:30,581
- That's really gross!
- Gross!

87
00:05:30,665 --> 00:05:31,708
Dad!

88
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:33,960
Is it an animal you'd have for a pet?

89
00:05:34,085 --> 00:05:35,586
- Yes.
- Is it a cat?

90
00:05:35,712 --> 00:05:36,963
Yes.

91
00:05:37,255 --> 00:05:38,881
- Okay, now we have another one.
- Do another one.

92
00:05:39,257 --> 00:05:41,092
You totally got one!

93
00:05:41,217 --> 00:05:42,343
Why are there so many?

94
00:05:42,427 --> 00:05:44,095
It's like, three in the last five minutes.

95
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:46,848
What is going on?

96
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:53,271
The World Health Organization
has been

97
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:55,148
tracking the recent outbreak of rabies

98
00:05:55,231 --> 00:05:58,985
that began in Taiwan and has now been
reported in over 12 countries.

99
00:05:59,068 --> 00:06:02,113
Responding to allegations he hasn't
done enough to prevent the spread...

100
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,614
Can we try BBC?

101
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,325
You're not British anymore, baby.

102
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:07,952
You lost your accent a long time ago.

103
00:06:08,453 --> 00:06:10,413
Except after two bottles of wine.

104
00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:11,706
Am I British?

105
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:12,999
Yeah, your grandma is.

106
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:15,960
Hey!

107
00:06:17,962 --> 00:06:19,422
He's just gonna keep going, Daddy?

108
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:20,506
Hold on, guys.

109
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:21,674
Daddy, be careful on the road.

110
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:23,426
It's okay, baby.

111
00:06:27,805 --> 00:06:29,432
Can be transmitted between species

112
00:06:29,515 --> 00:06:31,851
commonly from a bite
from an infected animal.

113
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:40,151
Our best recommendation is to stay
away from densely populated areas.

114
00:06:40,443 --> 00:06:41,986
Hey, yo! You all right?

115
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,279
Yeah, I'm okay. Thanks.

116
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:45,615
- You need anything?
- No. You know what's going on?

117
00:06:45,698 --> 00:06:47,158
No, man, I don't know anything.

118
00:06:47,283 --> 00:06:48,659
It's crazy.

119
00:06:52,789 --> 00:06:53,956
Gerry?

120
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:02,173
Get back in your car right now!

121
00:07:03,508 --> 00:07:05,176
Remain with your ve...

122
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:13,142
What are we doing?

123
00:07:13,226 --> 00:07:14,393
That's our way out of here.

124
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,708
I want my blanket!

125
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:38,876
Baby, it's packed right now.

126
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,336
Snuggle with Subway Sam, okay?

127
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:46,425
My blanket!

128
00:07:53,933 --> 00:07:54,934
Rach?

129
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:57,061
Rachel, baby, you've got
to get back in your seat.

130
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,605
- Baby, we need you in your seat.
- Put your belt on!

131
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:00,940
Rachel, right now!

132
00:08:01,065 --> 00:08:02,817
- Gerry?
- Rach, get your belt back on!

133
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:16,080
- You Okay?
- You Okay?

134
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:17,999
- Rachel, sweetheart?
- Rachel, you hurt?

135
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:21,002
- Connie?
- Are you okay? It's okay.

136
00:08:25,548 --> 00:08:26,549
We should get out.

137
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:27,967
Everybody out of the car.

138
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:39,312
We've got to get out of the city.

139
00:08:39,437 --> 00:08:41,564
Her door won't open!
Rachel, go out that side.

140
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:48,196
Okay, you have to climb over, honey.

141
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:49,739
Out of the way!

142
00:08:51,574 --> 00:08:52,783
Move it!

143
00:08:57,663 --> 00:08:59,123
Come on, honey. Come on.

144
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:03,294
Sweetheart, are you okay?

145
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,744
Let's go. Let's get off the street.

146
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:48,256
What is that, Gerry? What is that?

147
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:49,507
I don't know!

148
00:09:50,091 --> 00:09:51,425
Get to the RV.

149
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:52,551
Subway Sam!

150
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:55,471
Here comes the number 12 train! One.

151
00:09:57,348 --> 00:09:58,391
Two.

152
00:09:59,058 --> 00:10:01,060
- What's happening?
- Three.

153
00:10:01,894 --> 00:10:02,937
Four.

154
00:10:04,355 --> 00:10:05,606
Five.

155
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:07,942
Six.

156
00:10:08,276 --> 00:10:09,402
Seven.

157
00:10:10,486 --> 00:10:11,487
Eight.

158
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:13,864
Nine.

159
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:15,992
Ten.

160
00:10:16,701 --> 00:10:18,202
Eleven.

161
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:20,246
Twelve.

162
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,208
Train's in the station!

163
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:48,107
Gerry!

164
00:10:49,567 --> 00:10:51,193
Watch out!

165
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:33,444
We're pulling back on Fifth Street!

166
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:35,154
Containment is a fail.

167
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:49,919
Try to relax.

168
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:51,796
Give yourself air.

169
00:11:52,254 --> 00:11:53,631
In and out.

170
00:11:54,298 --> 00:11:56,801
Come on, baby, try to relax.

171
00:11:57,343 --> 00:11:59,887
Gerry? We left my purse in the car.

172
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,180
Where's her spare?

173
00:12:01,931 --> 00:12:04,809
I'm gonna go check
your backpack, all right?

174
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:07,186
Do you want to be with her?

175
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:17,655
Rach, you'll be all right.
You're gonna be all right.

176
00:12:17,822 --> 00:12:20,074
Hey, hey, you breathe
through your nose.

177
00:12:20,658 --> 00:12:22,827
Rach, Rach, look at me. Look at me.

178
00:12:23,661 --> 00:12:25,162
You're gonna be all right.

179
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:27,998
You've done this a hundred times.
Look at me. Look at me.

180
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:31,127
Breathe in through your nose,
out through your mouth.

181
00:12:33,129 --> 00:12:34,296
Okay, we're gonna go to a pharmacy.

182
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,006
We gotta move.

183
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:39,135
Okay.

184
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,512
Good. Good. Look.

185
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:44,473
Look at me, look at me.
Rach, breathe through your nose.

186
00:12:44,557 --> 00:12:45,933
No, no, no, no...

187
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:47,560
You're gonna be all right.

188
00:12:47,643 --> 00:12:48,936
- Look at me.
- Daddy, what are those things?

189
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:51,564
Honey, find us some water.
Okay? Something to drink.

190
00:12:57,111 --> 00:12:58,154
It's Thierry.

191
00:12:58,362 --> 00:12:59,405
Where are you?

192
00:13:00,072 --> 00:13:02,366
Airborne. Lower East Side to Turtle Bay.

193
00:13:04,076 --> 00:13:06,162
It's all gone. We barely made it out.

194
00:13:06,245 --> 00:13:08,539
- Tell him to go south.
- No, no, we need visual confirmation.

195
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:10,166
No,no,no,no,no,no,no.

196
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:12,460
What is this?

197
00:13:12,543 --> 00:13:14,044
We don't know. How close were you?

198
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:15,546
Face to face.

199
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:17,047
Good, honey, good.

200
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:20,134
Daddy.

201
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:22,470
Connie, give me that.

202
00:13:22,553 --> 00:13:24,054
Give me that. Oh, thank you, honey.

203
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:25,431
Where are you?

204
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:26,807
95, heading north.

205
00:13:28,017 --> 00:13:29,894
Okay. Okay.

206
00:13:30,102 --> 00:13:33,189
All right.
We'll try to get a helicopter to you.

207
00:13:33,272 --> 00:13:35,274
I'll call you back with an extraction point.

208
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:37,485
Can you hold out for another hour?

209
00:13:37,568 --> 00:13:39,069
Do we have a choice?

210
00:13:39,153 --> 00:13:40,821
This is not
for old time's sake, my friend.

211
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:42,281
I'll need you.

212
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:44,241
I need you back.

213
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:45,451
Don't forget about us.

214
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:46,994
What do you mean, we've lost Boston?

215
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:48,579
All right. Good luck, Gerry.

216
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:50,706
Okay.

217
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:53,792
Good, honey. Keep it going.
It's gonna be all right.

218
00:14:06,764 --> 00:14:08,974
- Come here. Stay close.
- Super close.

219
00:14:09,058 --> 00:14:10,601
Take my hand.

220
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:15,564
Get her medicine,
I'll get us something to eat.

221
00:14:15,648 --> 00:14:17,566
I'll meet you back here.

222
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,043
Stay close, honey.

223
00:14:50,808 --> 00:14:52,351
What do you need?

224
00:14:53,978 --> 00:14:55,020
Albuterol.

225
00:15:07,116 --> 00:15:09,535
They outgrow the asthma supposedly.

226
00:15:14,123 --> 00:15:16,292
And this shit, too. It's magic for my kid.

227
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:19,503
Thank you.

228
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:26,176
- Daddy!
- Connie?

229
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:28,429
Daddy!

230
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:30,472
- Connie?
- Daddy!

231
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:31,974
- Where's Mommy?
- Gerry!

232
00:15:32,558 --> 00:15:33,892
Gerry!

233
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:35,269
Karin?

234
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:37,896
- Karin?
- Gerry! Gerry!

235
00:15:38,022 --> 00:15:40,566
Get off of me!
Get off of me! That's all I have.

236
00:15:40,691 --> 00:15:42,192
- Gerry!
- Hey!

237
00:15:43,694 --> 00:15:45,529
- Hey!
- Gerry.

238
00:16:03,464 --> 00:16:05,799
Multiple 11-99s at Washington Park.

239
00:16:05,883 --> 00:16:08,636
Please, send units.
We're falling back on Reed Street.

240
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:10,638
Two Robert 12, units need backup.

241
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:12,640
Mobile ops is down. Please respond.

242
00:16:12,723 --> 00:16:14,266
Two Robert 12, are you there? Copy.

243
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:15,851
- Girls!
- Responders, Code 3, Code 3.

244
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:18,062
Rachel, quick, come on.

245
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:25,861
No.

246
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:27,863
No!

247
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:30,908
We got to get out of here.
We got to get off the street.

248
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:32,076
Gerry.

249
00:16:32,618 --> 00:16:33,952
Apartments?

250
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:37,247
Hey. Yeah.

251
00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:46,757
- Gerry?
- We're in Newark.

252
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,175
We're stranded.

253
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:49,843
Apartment buildings, 23rd.

254
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:52,179
If we can get to the roof,
can you get someone to us?

255
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:53,597
- Not tonight.
- When?

256
00:16:53,764 --> 00:16:54,807
The earliest would be sunrise.

257
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:55,891
Sunrise.

258
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:57,393
Tell him I got flares.

259
00:16:57,476 --> 00:16:59,603
We'll be on the roof with flares.

260
00:16:59,687 --> 00:17:02,106
Listen, Gerry, I will move
mountains to get you out here.

261
00:17:11,115 --> 00:17:12,533
Come here, baby.

262
00:17:19,331 --> 00:17:20,999
Go! Go! Go!

263
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,962
- Baby, in here!
- Come on. Quick!

264
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:26,672
Gerry!

265
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:37,349
Inside, girls!

266
00:17:37,433 --> 00:17:39,309
By the stairs. Inside, inside!

267
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:42,813
Wait!

268
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:45,774
Wait.

269
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,695
Up, up. It's okay, baby.

270
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:54,950
Run! Run! Go, Rachel!

271
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:56,076
Go!

272
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,536
Go!

273
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:00,372
Keep running, baby.

274
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,791
-It's all right.
- To the top.

275
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:10,174
Go! Go!

276
00:18:13,552 --> 00:18:14,553
Go!

277
00:18:29,026 --> 00:18:30,027
Run!

278
00:18:37,576 --> 00:18:39,203
Go! Go! Go! Go!

279
00:18:40,037 --> 00:18:41,288
I need a new flare!

280
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:43,999
This asshole's about to get through!

281
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:55,886
Where's Connie? Connie?

282
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,721
- Connie?
- Connie!

283
00:18:58,013 --> 00:18:59,973
- Let me in!
- Connie!

284
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:14,196
- Baby?
-It's not her. It's not her.

285
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:16,615
- Let me in!
- Connie!

286
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:17,991
Let me in!

287
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,873
In, in, in! In!

288
00:19:33,257 --> 00:19:34,508
Thank you so much.

289
00:19:36,677 --> 00:19:38,512
- I'm Tomas.
- Hey, Tomas.

290
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:40,722
My mom's cooking everything
before it starts to stink.

291
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:43,183
That's smart.

292
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:44,393
You guys all right?

293
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:45,602
It's all right.

294
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:47,521
It's okay.

295
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:50,148
Are you guys hungry?

296
00:19:50,232 --> 00:19:51,608
Yes, thank you.

297
00:20:14,715 --> 00:20:17,259
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

298
00:20:18,886 --> 00:20:20,012
Thank you.

299
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:22,222
You want some juice?

300
00:20:22,306 --> 00:20:23,307
The following message

301
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:26,977
is transmitted at the request of the
New Jersey State Police Department.

302
00:20:27,728 --> 00:20:30,230
Authorities recommend
that the following actions

303
00:20:30,314 --> 00:20:32,149
should be taken
by all the members of the public.

304
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:34,902
Stay indoors if at all possible.

305
00:20:36,862 --> 00:20:38,989
Have enough food
and water supplies for sheltering

306
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:40,866
for one to two weeks.

307
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:43,619
The following message
is transmitted at the request

308
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:45,829
of the New Jersey State
Police Department.

309
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:48,790
An unidentified virus strain is rapidly

310
00:20:48,874 --> 00:20:50,918
spreading across
the state of New Jersey.

311
00:21:35,212 --> 00:21:36,380
She was crying.

312
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,471
Thanks, Tommy.

313
00:21:46,014 --> 00:21:48,684
I used to work in dangerous places

314
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:51,853
and people who moved survived,
and those who didn't...

315
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:57,317
Movement is life.

316
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,572
You have a better chance
if you come with us.

317
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,292
You need anything else
before you leave?

318
00:22:58,003 --> 00:23:00,338
Okay. Come on. Come on.

319
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:26,740
We should have left with them.

320
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:28,116
There is nowhere to go.

321
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,160
What's going to happen
when the food is gone?

322
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:39,920
Okay, come on.

323
00:23:43,465 --> 00:23:44,841
I'm scared.

324
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:48,220
Connie, there's a helicopter
waiting for us on the roof.

325
00:23:48,303 --> 00:23:50,931
Keep your eyes
on Mommy and Daddy, okay?

326
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:52,349
Be ninja quiet.

327
00:23:52,933 --> 00:23:54,851
Just a walk in the park.

328
00:23:55,685 --> 00:23:57,521
How do we know they're coming?

329
00:23:57,979 --> 00:23:59,439
They're coming.

330
00:23:59,523 --> 00:24:00,524
Ready?

331
00:24:16,706 --> 00:24:18,375
Okay, come on, guys.

332
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,631
Come on! Come on!

333
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:27,717
Up, up, Up.

334
00:24:28,135 --> 00:24:29,302
Come on, baby.

335
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:31,012
Go, go, go!

336
00:24:32,139 --> 00:24:34,266
- Come on, baby!
- Go, go!

337
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:36,560
Go, girls! Gerry!

338
00:24:37,894 --> 00:24:39,104
Come on. Gerry!

339
00:24:39,187 --> 00:24:40,605
Girls, get back!

340
00:24:42,107 --> 00:24:43,817
Watch out!

341
00:24:54,452 --> 00:24:56,329
-Go!
-Go, go, go!

342
00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:58,165
Come on, faster, girls!

343
00:25:01,293 --> 00:25:03,295
Lieutenant, I've got no contact.

344
00:25:03,378 --> 00:25:05,130
I say again, no contact.

345
00:25:05,881 --> 00:25:07,257
Let's go, let's go!

346
00:25:09,426 --> 00:25:10,594
Karin!

347
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:12,053
- Karin!
- Yeah.

348
00:25:13,305 --> 00:25:14,598
Go through the door!

349
00:25:17,434 --> 00:25:18,602
Gerry?

350
00:25:56,139 --> 00:25:58,058
There they are!
Ace, we have positive contact.

351
00:25:58,141 --> 00:25:59,809
That's our target! Get us down!

352
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:00,977
Daddy!

353
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:02,938
- Daddy!
- Baby, get back.

354
00:26:03,146 --> 00:26:04,481
Daddy!

355
00:26:04,564 --> 00:26:05,565
Gerry?

356
00:26:05,649 --> 00:26:07,234
- Gerry, what?
- Stay back!

357
00:26:07,317 --> 00:26:08,735
Baby! No!

358
00:26:08,818 --> 00:26:10,153
One thousand seven.

359
00:26:10,237 --> 00:26:11,738
One thousand eight.

360
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:13,490
Daddy, get off the edge!

361
00:26:13,573 --> 00:26:15,992
- Gerry, please?
- One thousand ten.

362
00:26:17,911 --> 00:26:19,663
One thousand eleven.

363
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,128
I got it in my mouth.

364
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,631
You're okay. You're okay.

365
00:26:32,259 --> 00:26:33,343
Go! Go!

366
00:26:36,304 --> 00:26:37,722
Come on. Come on.

367
00:26:46,189 --> 00:26:47,357
Let's go! Let's go!

368
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:49,484
Come on, let's go! We got to go!

369
00:26:53,905 --> 00:26:55,073
You got her?

370
00:27:07,877 --> 00:27:09,671
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

371
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:35,322
Traffic en route, altitude 5-7 thousand.

372
00:27:35,405 --> 00:27:38,992
Heading 250. Turn right,
heading 075, once clear.

373
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:41,661
Remain below 4, 000.

374
00:27:56,176 --> 00:28:00,472
Clear to land,
heading 040, wind 060 at five.

375
00:28:03,224 --> 00:28:05,685
Follow L. S. O. directions.
Prep for immediate dust off.

376
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:29,417
Gerry.

377
00:28:29,584 --> 00:28:30,960
Thank you.

378
00:28:31,044 --> 00:28:33,046
Good to see you, my friend.

379
00:28:33,129 --> 00:28:34,881
Tango five, this is Argus command.

380
00:28:34,964 --> 00:28:36,132
Cleared for take-off.

381
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:38,301
Tango five. Wilco.

382
00:28:57,278 --> 00:28:58,530
Karin, to the right.

383
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,323
This is good, right?

384
00:29:00,407 --> 00:29:02,075
Bunk beds!

385
00:29:02,158 --> 00:29:05,120
Your bunk beds
are number two, three and six.

386
00:29:05,453 --> 00:29:06,663
Please make yourself at home.

387
00:29:06,746 --> 00:29:08,164
You want to get up here?

388
00:29:08,915 --> 00:29:11,751
- There you go, sweetheart.
- That's good.

389
00:29:11,835 --> 00:29:13,628
We're not dropping anchor again.

390
00:29:14,129 --> 00:29:15,255
You're safe.

391
00:29:15,338 --> 00:29:16,423
It's not me I'm worried about.

392
00:29:16,506 --> 00:29:17,966
They're safe.

393
00:29:18,633 --> 00:29:20,009
Baby.

394
00:29:21,344 --> 00:29:23,888
It's bigger than
our old apartment on 72nd.

395
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,307
Need anything, Karin?

396
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:27,892
Water.

397
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,602
I'll organize.

398
00:29:31,354 --> 00:29:33,773
Is this worldwide?
Is anyone doing better than we are?

399
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:37,026
Baby. Go talk somewhere else.

400
00:29:37,694 --> 00:29:38,820
Okay.

401
00:29:47,996 --> 00:29:49,205
The President is dead.

402
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:53,209
Four of six Joint Chiefs. V.P. missing.

403
00:29:53,793 --> 00:29:56,629
Reports of gun battles
in the streets of the capital.

404
00:29:56,713 --> 00:29:57,881
Your parties are panicking.

405
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,341
The bigger cities are the worst off.

406
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:03,386
The airlines
were the perfect delivery system.

407
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:07,932
Carnival cruise vessel Dream
has been given permission to join.

408
00:30:08,183 --> 00:30:10,727
Twenty seven knots south and closing.

409
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,062
How soon are they showing
symptoms after contact?

410
00:30:13,229 --> 00:30:14,981
The provisional
government currently considers

411
00:30:15,064 --> 00:30:16,524
northern Minnesota
to be a potential safe zone.

412
00:30:16,608 --> 00:30:20,028
Have you recorded any instance where
a person was bitten but not infected?

413
00:30:25,617 --> 00:30:27,452
How the hell do I know
if Russia's fallen?

414
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:34,042
Sir, I cannot action that order.

415
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:35,835
Colonel, I'm sorry,
but we cannot facilitate

416
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:37,754
an evacuation for you or your men.

417
00:30:38,046 --> 00:30:41,049
Sir, there is nowhere to evacuate you to.

418
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:43,885
Malnutrition. Dirty water.

419
00:30:44,511 --> 00:30:46,429
No gas for the winter or transportation.

420
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:48,681
No bullets to fight.

421
00:30:48,765 --> 00:30:50,433
And it has spread
to all corners of the globe.

422
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,976
The question
that we have got to address

423
00:30:52,101 --> 00:30:53,353
is what the hell is it?

424
00:30:53,436 --> 00:30:55,688
About 5% of the population
aren't affected immediately.

425
00:30:55,772 --> 00:30:59,609
It is viral. it has to be viral.
There is no plausible alternative.

426
00:30:59,943 --> 00:31:03,863
And like any virus, once we find its
origin, we can develop a vaccine.

427
00:31:03,947 --> 00:31:06,616
- We find it, contain it...
- That's Dr. Fassbach.

428
00:31:07,242 --> 00:31:08,535
Virologist from Harvard.

429
00:31:08,618 --> 00:31:11,079
The analogy I keep coming back to

430
00:31:11,329 --> 00:31:12,622
is Spanish Flu.

431
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:13,831
Spanish Flu?

432
00:31:13,957 --> 00:31:16,000
It didn't exist in 1918, but by 1920,

433
00:31:16,084 --> 00:31:18,044
it killed 3% of the world.

434
00:31:18,253 --> 00:31:21,506
He's our best bet
at figuring out what this thing is.

435
00:31:21,965 --> 00:31:23,466
You all read the same email I did,

436
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,301
and it said "zombies."

437
00:31:26,594 --> 00:31:28,888
Are you completely out of your mind?

438
00:31:28,972 --> 00:31:31,516
So, the earliest mention
of the word "zombie"

439
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:34,394
was in a memo
from Camp Humphreys in South Korea.

440
00:31:34,644 --> 00:31:36,229
We haven't had contact with them since.

441
00:31:36,312 --> 00:31:37,689
But this could lead us to the origin.

442
00:31:37,772 --> 00:31:39,524
If we knew where this thing started,

443
00:31:39,607 --> 00:31:42,694
then we'd have a chance
of developing a vaccine to stop it.

444
00:31:42,777 --> 00:31:45,613
So we send in Dr. Fassbach
there to look for the source.

445
00:31:45,697 --> 00:31:47,198
He's just a kid.

446
00:31:48,157 --> 00:31:49,242
You're right.

447
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,661
Attention on deck!

448
00:31:56,207 --> 00:31:57,333
At ease!

449
00:32:00,336 --> 00:32:02,171
Mr. Under-Secretary.

450
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,675
The Under-Secretary
here says you were

451
00:32:05,758 --> 00:32:08,428
his best investigator
when you were at the U.N.

452
00:32:08,511 --> 00:32:10,930
I want to send you in. With a team.

453
00:32:11,014 --> 00:32:14,017
Help Dr. Fassbach
find whatever it is he needs.

454
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:15,768
You brought...

455
00:32:15,852 --> 00:32:17,854
I wanted for the circumstances
to speak for themselves.

456
00:32:17,937 --> 00:32:19,022
No.

457
00:32:20,523 --> 00:32:22,692
Captain, I'm not your guy.

458
00:32:23,735 --> 00:32:26,821
You were on the ground
during the Liberian Civil War.

459
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:30,617
Investigated Chechen war crimes.
Sri Lanka in '07.

460
00:32:30,867 --> 00:32:33,661
Places you and I both know
Dr. Fassbach wouldn't last a night in.

461
00:32:33,745 --> 00:32:36,205
Gerry, a handful of SEALs
will go with you as security force.

462
00:32:36,289 --> 00:32:37,332
No.

463
00:32:37,415 --> 00:32:39,500
My guys will get you in,
you assist the doctor,

464
00:32:39,584 --> 00:32:41,628
pursue any leads,
my guys will get you out.

465
00:32:42,086 --> 00:32:43,546
We do the heavy lifting.

466
00:32:44,422 --> 00:32:47,717
I can't help you. I can't leave my family.

467
00:32:49,927 --> 00:32:51,888
Take a look around here, Mr. Lane.

468
00:32:52,388 --> 00:32:56,809
Each and every one of these people are
here because they serve a purpose.

469
00:32:58,227 --> 00:33:01,397
There's no room here
for non-essential personnel.

470
00:33:01,773 --> 00:33:03,107
There's a long line of people

471
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,984
waiting for one of those bunks.

472
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:09,447
You want to help your family,

473
00:33:09,572 --> 00:33:12,200
let's figure out how we stop this.

474
00:33:12,909 --> 00:33:14,911
It's your choice, Mr. Lane.

475
00:33:15,244 --> 00:33:16,412
Simple.

476
00:33:18,956 --> 00:33:20,375
You don't work for them anymore.

477
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:21,876
- Karin...
- You might not remember

478
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:24,045
what this job did to you, but I do.

479
00:33:24,128 --> 00:33:26,089
So do not ask me to say yes to this.

480
00:33:26,172 --> 00:33:27,215
I have to go.

481
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:30,051
They're going to kick us off the ship.

482
00:33:31,886 --> 00:33:32,929
What?

483
00:33:33,513 --> 00:33:36,599
If I go, you, the girls, Tommy,
have a place to stay.

484
00:33:36,683 --> 00:33:39,519
If I don't, we're back in Philly tonight.

485
00:33:40,603 --> 00:33:43,022
What about Thierry?
Can't he do anything?

486
00:33:43,523 --> 00:33:46,609
Men like Thierry
aren't in charge of anything anymore.

487
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,195
You keep this with you.

488
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:50,279
I'll call in once a day.

489
00:33:50,363 --> 00:33:52,740
As long as I make that call,
everything's gonna be okay.

490
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:56,077
I'm coming back.

491
00:33:56,452 --> 00:33:58,579
Okay?
We're going to make the best of it.

492
00:34:00,123 --> 00:34:01,457
As we do.

493
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:03,126
Like we do.

494
00:34:13,803 --> 00:34:16,806
Okay, baby doll,
Daddy's got to go to work.

495
00:34:17,348 --> 00:34:19,016
I'm not a baby.

496
00:34:19,976 --> 00:34:21,144
Okay.

497
00:34:21,477 --> 00:34:23,646
Tall, beautiful, tiny adult.

498
00:34:24,981 --> 00:34:27,066
I'll be back soon.

499
00:34:27,233 --> 00:34:28,359
Yeah?

500
00:34:29,819 --> 00:34:31,696
All right, tough guy..-

501
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,364
Take care of the ladies for me?

502
00:34:33,448 --> 00:34:34,490
Yeah.

503
00:34:34,615 --> 00:34:35,742
Deal.

504
00:34:37,452 --> 00:34:38,995
You're awesome.

505
00:34:45,877 --> 00:34:48,004
Daddy's coming back.

506
00:35:15,531 --> 00:35:17,033
This way, sir.

507
00:36:00,243 --> 00:36:01,327
Look.

508
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:02,620
We don't know what we're walking into.

509
00:36:02,745 --> 00:36:04,705
So we do what they say. Okay.

510
00:36:04,872 --> 00:36:07,375
If they move, we move.
If they stop, we stop.

511
00:36:07,458 --> 00:36:09,126
If things were to get crazy,

512
00:36:09,418 --> 00:36:10,711
just focus on their boots,

513
00:36:10,795 --> 00:36:12,338
focus on their voices,
and we'll be all right.

514
00:36:13,256 --> 00:36:14,841
These guys are hammers.

515
00:36:14,924 --> 00:36:16,676
And to hammers,
everything looks like nails.

516
00:36:16,759 --> 00:36:17,844
I heard that.

517
00:36:17,927 --> 00:36:19,428
You were meant to.

518
00:36:19,595 --> 00:36:21,556
So, you see something that's important,

519
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:23,850
you call it out and we'll make it happen.

520
00:36:24,308 --> 00:36:25,518
Okay.

521
00:36:27,228 --> 00:36:29,397
You think we're gonna find anything?

522
00:36:30,064 --> 00:36:31,148
Yeah.

523
00:36:31,732 --> 00:36:33,401
Yeah, we're gonna find something.

524
00:36:34,777 --> 00:36:37,780
Mother Nature is a serial killer.

525
00:36:38,906 --> 00:36:40,408
No one's better.

526
00:36:40,741 --> 00:36:42,243
More creative.

527
00:36:43,452 --> 00:36:44,704
But like all serial killers,

528
00:36:44,787 --> 00:36:47,582
she can't help the urge
to want to get caught.

529
00:36:48,249 --> 00:36:49,834
What good are all those brilliant crimes

530
00:36:49,917 --> 00:36:52,003
if no one takes the credit?

531
00:36:52,128 --> 00:36:54,088
So she leaves crumbs.

532
00:36:55,131 --> 00:36:57,174
Now, the hard part,
why you spend a decade in school,

533
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:00,219
is seeing the crumbs
for the clues they are.

534
00:37:00,845 --> 00:37:02,930
Sometimes the thing you thought

535
00:37:03,139 --> 00:37:06,475
was the most brutal aspect of the virus,

536
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:09,645
turns out to be the chink in its armor.

537
00:37:11,981 --> 00:37:15,651
And she loves disguising
her weaknesses as strengths.

538
00:37:18,154 --> 00:37:19,697
She's a bitch.

539
00:37:30,875 --> 00:37:33,294
<i>Attention. D. C. has gone dark. I repeat,</i>

540
00:37:33,377 --> 00:37:34,712
D.C. has gone dark.

541
00:37:34,837 --> 00:37:36,797
The Capitol evacuation
has been suspended.

542
00:37:37,214 --> 00:37:41,385
All available resources should be
directed to Naval Station Norfolk.

543
00:37:42,678 --> 00:37:44,805
All non-essential personnel

544
00:37:44,889 --> 00:37:47,600
given F-6 status
and in groups A through E

545
00:37:47,683 --> 00:37:50,519
need to report
to the flight deck for relocation.

546
00:37:51,854 --> 00:37:54,941
Groups A and B relocating to Orlando

547
00:37:55,024 --> 00:37:57,443
should be on the stern
clear of the landing zone.

548
00:37:59,528 --> 00:38:03,658
I say again, all non-essential
personnel given F-6 status

549
00:38:03,741 --> 00:38:05,743
need to report to the flight deck.

550
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:08,788
Choppers are inbound
for immediate relocation.

551
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,715
Mommy, is this dinner?

552
00:38:20,049 --> 00:38:21,175
Yes, sweetheart.

553
00:38:21,258 --> 00:38:23,219
Water here tastes funny.

554
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:25,346
It's jet fuel, young lady.

555
00:38:25,721 --> 00:38:27,139
He's joking.

556
00:38:28,224 --> 00:38:32,061
I wish. Desal has trouble filtering it out.

557
00:38:32,895 --> 00:38:36,273
Probably because
there's too many people on this ship.

558
00:38:46,575 --> 00:38:48,577
Everybody wake up.

559
00:38:49,286 --> 00:38:51,706
We're on approach
to Camp Humphreys.

560
00:38:51,789 --> 00:38:55,167
Most of the base is dark,
and no one is manning the tower.

561
00:38:55,251 --> 00:38:57,253
We're running on fumes,
so there's really no choice,

562
00:38:57,336 --> 00:38:58,713
I've got to put us down.

563
00:38:58,796 --> 00:39:00,131
So buckle up.

564
00:39:26,657 --> 00:39:27,783
Hold up.

565
00:39:28,492 --> 00:39:30,578
Keep your finger off the trigger.

566
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,627
Okay.

567
00:40:04,987 --> 00:40:06,447
Fassbach! Wait!

568
00:40:08,991 --> 00:40:10,284
Damn it.

569
00:40:18,167 --> 00:40:19,168
Move back!

570
00:40:20,336 --> 00:40:23,130
Friendly! Friendly!
Keep it down. Keep it down.

571
00:40:23,214 --> 00:40:25,007
What is this? What happened to him?

572
00:40:25,341 --> 00:40:26,550
He slipped. He's dead.

573
00:40:26,634 --> 00:40:28,594
Come on! Come on! Let's go! Let's go!

574
00:40:46,529 --> 00:40:47,696
Okay, I'm good!

575
00:40:47,988 --> 00:40:50,032
- Who was it? Who fell?
- Skilken.

576
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:52,201
- Hold! Clear.
- Hold.

577
00:40:53,994 --> 00:40:55,663
I want an ammo count,
then you reload your mags!

578
00:40:55,746 --> 00:40:56,789
Yes, sir!

579
00:40:56,872 --> 00:40:58,791
My boy who just died out there was 23.

580
00:40:59,583 --> 00:41:00,918
He was 23.

581
00:41:01,502 --> 00:41:03,254
You want to tell me why?

582
00:41:03,337 --> 00:41:07,091
Because the guy who just shot
himself, he's a doctor, a virologist.

583
00:41:07,758 --> 00:41:08,884
What are you talking about?

584
00:41:08,968 --> 00:41:10,761
He was supposed to be our best hope.

585
00:41:10,845 --> 00:41:12,471
Well, he's not our best hope anymore.

586
00:41:12,555 --> 00:41:14,682
Hey.
That guy volunteered to come here.

587
00:41:14,765 --> 00:41:16,183
He didn't have to, you know.

588
00:41:16,267 --> 00:41:17,518
None of them did.

589
00:41:17,726 --> 00:41:19,854
We're still trying to figure out
what the hell this thing is.

590
00:41:20,271 --> 00:41:22,690
Well, shit happens.

591
00:41:24,233 --> 00:41:26,402
The doctor would have
strongly agreed with you.

592
00:41:26,485 --> 00:41:27,945
How do we go about refueling?

593
00:41:28,028 --> 00:41:31,198
When I say so. And very carefully.

594
00:41:32,158 --> 00:41:34,493
The noise, are they drawn to it?

595
00:41:34,827 --> 00:41:37,288
Yeah. Sound draws them.

596
00:41:37,621 --> 00:41:40,040
Body shots only seem
to slow them down.

597
00:41:40,124 --> 00:41:42,585
Head shots do the trick,
but just to be safe

598
00:41:42,668 --> 00:41:44,753
we tend to burn them when we can.

599
00:41:45,087 --> 00:41:47,047
- You fought any Zeke yet?
- Yeah.

600
00:41:47,256 --> 00:41:49,592
- Where?
- Philly. Newark.

601
00:41:49,967 --> 00:41:51,010
Bad?

602
00:41:54,054 --> 00:41:55,264
- What about Houston?
- St. Louis?

603
00:41:55,431 --> 00:41:56,473
- Baltimore?
- Atlanta?

604
00:41:56,557 --> 00:41:57,725
Detroit?

605
00:41:57,892 --> 00:41:59,018
Guys, I'll be honest with you,

606
00:41:59,101 --> 00:42:02,104
I don't know of any place back
home that's doing very well.

607
00:42:02,188 --> 00:42:03,606
All right...

608
00:42:05,274 --> 00:42:08,194
If the other guy was a virologist,
what do you do?

609
00:42:08,277 --> 00:42:11,780
There was a memo
sent from this installation 11 days ago.

610
00:42:12,072 --> 00:42:13,324
It had the word "zombie" in it.

611
00:42:13,407 --> 00:42:15,367
Do you know anything about it?

612
00:42:15,451 --> 00:42:16,535
Yeah.

613
00:42:16,911 --> 00:42:19,330
It was an email, not a memo.

614
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:22,291
Pretty obvious
nobody back home bothered to read it.

615
00:42:27,254 --> 00:42:30,424
Now, there's 15, 16 guys in this room.

616
00:42:30,758 --> 00:42:33,761
Most of them guards.
But all of them were bitten

617
00:42:33,844 --> 00:42:36,055
trying to get this man
handcuffed to the cot.

618
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:39,475
Now, our colonel
said he was the first one.

619
00:42:39,892 --> 00:42:41,560
This colonel, is he around?

620
00:42:41,644 --> 00:42:42,853
Oh, yeah. He's right here.

621
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:53,072
The guy who's shackled, do you know

622
00:42:53,322 --> 00:42:54,990
who bit him, what bit him?

623
00:42:55,324 --> 00:42:57,117
He was the base doctor.

624
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:01,121
He 'd just returned from the field.

625
00:43:01,455 --> 00:43:04,375
He'd been sent out
to verify the death of a soldier

626
00:43:04,458 --> 00:43:06,710
who had just gone AWOL
the week before.

627
00:43:07,127 --> 00:43:09,171
Some villagers had found this guy

628
00:43:09,255 --> 00:43:11,882
foaming at the mouth,
oozing some kind of black tar.

629
00:43:12,716 --> 00:43:14,802
Then he tried to bite one of them.

630
00:43:14,885 --> 00:43:17,179
They shot him, tied him up,
threw him in a barn.

631
00:43:31,318 --> 00:43:32,945
That's all we know, except the doctor

632
00:43:33,028 --> 00:43:36,115
comes back here
and begins attacking his patients.

633
00:43:36,198 --> 00:43:38,784
This soldier,
do you know where he came from?

634
00:43:39,034 --> 00:43:40,035
No.

635
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:43,122
Anyone he might
have come in contact with?

636
00:43:43,205 --> 00:43:44,206
No.

637
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:45,791
There's got to be records.

638
00:43:47,668 --> 00:43:49,545
You are welcome
to take a look if you want.

639
00:43:52,965 --> 00:43:55,551
Then the origin could
have come from anywhere.

640
00:43:55,884 --> 00:43:56,969
It's a shame you had to fly

641
00:43:57,052 --> 00:43:59,054
all the way out here to figure that out.

642
00:44:03,058 --> 00:44:04,727
How did you all escape this?

643
00:44:04,977 --> 00:44:07,313
The expenditure of ammunition.

644
00:44:08,814 --> 00:44:10,649
Is that how you tweaked your leg?

645
00:44:12,484 --> 00:44:14,361
No, shit's been bugging me a while.

646
00:44:15,404 --> 00:44:18,198
This prick stands right in the mix,

647
00:44:18,282 --> 00:44:19,658
while seven or eight of them

648
00:44:19,742 --> 00:44:21,577
turn Zeke all at the same time.

649
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:23,704
But they got no time
for OI' Dirty Bastard here.

650
00:44:23,787 --> 00:44:26,165
Biting everything like fat kids love Twix.

651
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:29,335
Got no time for his lucky ass.

652
00:44:29,418 --> 00:44:31,086
Ain't it obvious I'm charmed?

653
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:34,423
The ones I saw bitten
turned in 12 seconds. Same here?

654
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:35,924
Five or 10 minutes.

655
00:44:36,091 --> 00:44:39,345
Yeah, Davidson went
and he turned in 10 minutes.

656
00:44:39,678 --> 00:44:40,846
"Stevie?

657
00:44:40,929 --> 00:44:44,266
"Captain Spekes! Oh, my God!
My God! My God! Are they eating me?"

658
00:44:44,933 --> 00:44:45,934
Who's that?

659
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:47,728
Waste no time on that freak.

660
00:44:48,103 --> 00:44:49,188
He's C.l.A.

661
00:44:49,271 --> 00:44:51,190
Got caught selling guns to North Korea.

662
00:44:51,273 --> 00:44:52,608
Davidson,

663
00:44:53,108 --> 00:44:55,277
he turned in 10 minutes.

664
00:44:55,611 --> 00:44:58,947
That doesn't sound viral
to me at all, sports fans!

665
00:45:01,909 --> 00:45:03,702
You're with the C.l.A.?

666
00:45:07,373 --> 00:45:08,707
But they're not with me.

667
00:45:12,961 --> 00:45:14,505
And who are you?

668
00:45:14,588 --> 00:45:16,006
U.N.

669
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:17,758
Oh, my God!

670
00:45:20,386 --> 00:45:22,429
Captain, put on the World Music!

671
00:45:22,763 --> 00:45:24,431
The day

672
00:45:25,224 --> 00:45:26,892
is saved!

673
00:45:27,643 --> 00:45:28,811
Why'd you sell guns to the North?

674
00:45:28,894 --> 00:45:29,978
Why not?

675
00:45:30,145 --> 00:45:31,397
Are they surviving this?

676
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:32,689
Indeed they are.

677
00:45:32,773 --> 00:45:34,233
Using your guns.

678
00:45:34,316 --> 00:45:37,319
Guns are half-measures.

679
00:45:37,611 --> 00:45:38,654
How then?

680
00:45:42,074 --> 00:45:43,200
All right.

681
00:46:08,767 --> 00:46:10,269
They took away

682
00:46:11,562 --> 00:46:15,274
the Zekes' exponential power.

683
00:46:16,942 --> 00:46:20,446
They pulled the teeth of all 23 million

684
00:46:20,863 --> 00:46:24,116
in less than 24 hours.

685
00:46:28,537 --> 00:46:31,582
The greatest feat
of social engineering in history.

686
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,542
It's brilliant.

687
00:46:33,917 --> 00:46:35,210
No teeth,

688
00:46:36,253 --> 00:46:37,546
no bite.

689
00:46:38,172 --> 00:46:39,756
No great spread.

690
00:46:43,802 --> 00:46:44,887
Bullshit.

691
00:46:45,095 --> 00:46:48,515
More books,
fewer receptions, Boutros Boutros.

692
00:46:48,932 --> 00:46:50,893
Now, why do you have to burn them

693
00:46:50,976 --> 00:46:52,728
to ashes to get them to finally stop?

694
00:46:52,811 --> 00:46:54,396
Why do they move like a plague?

695
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,190
Why is Israel winning?

696
00:46:57,274 --> 00:46:58,859
How is Israel winning?

697
00:46:59,651 --> 00:47:01,904
They sealed off their entire country

698
00:47:02,613 --> 00:47:05,574
days before the undead attacked man.

699
00:47:06,033 --> 00:47:07,367
First to know,

700
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:09,369
first to act.

701
00:47:09,661 --> 00:47:11,788
People have been
building walls there for two millennia.

702
00:47:12,998 --> 00:47:14,583
Right. Yeah, but,

703
00:47:14,666 --> 00:47:16,376
finish all those

704
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:19,087
thousands of years of work a week ago?

705
00:47:20,005 --> 00:47:21,465
Impeccable timing is all.

706
00:47:25,093 --> 00:47:26,762
You want answers?

707
00:47:28,722 --> 00:47:30,432
Jurgen Warmbrunn.

708
00:47:31,475 --> 00:47:35,479
That's the man
in Jerusalem you want to see.

709
00:47:36,813 --> 00:47:37,981
You ever seen anything like that?

710
00:47:38,106 --> 00:47:39,274
Hell, no.

711
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:42,694
We're going to Jerusalem.
I'm your co-pilot.

712
00:47:49,326 --> 00:47:50,452
Oh, hang on.

713
00:47:50,661 --> 00:47:52,287
Hang on. Hang on a minute.

714
00:47:53,330 --> 00:47:54,581
Hello?

715
00:47:56,166 --> 00:47:57,376
Gerry?

716
00:47:58,293 --> 00:48:00,212
- Honey?
- Gerry, can you hear me?

717
00:48:00,295 --> 00:48:01,338
Kaﬂn?

718
00:48:02,089 --> 00:48:03,340
Hello?

719
00:48:06,468 --> 00:48:08,136
God damn it!

720
00:48:17,854 --> 00:48:19,523
Give me your hand.

721
00:48:22,526 --> 00:48:23,569
No way. No.

722
00:48:23,652 --> 00:48:24,903
My mother. Dallas.

723
00:48:24,987 --> 00:48:27,573
Probably pacing a hole
in the floor right now if she's still there.

724
00:48:27,656 --> 00:48:30,200
Better chance of you seeing
her before me, that's all.

725
00:48:30,284 --> 00:48:32,744
It's a big plane. We got a lot of room.

726
00:48:32,828 --> 00:48:35,831
Better the devil you know
than the one you don't.

727
00:48:36,290 --> 00:48:38,959
You'll be all right.
Just pedal your ass off.

728
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:41,253
Make sure Maverick here keeps
the nose of that plane

729
00:48:41,336 --> 00:48:42,421
pointed towards the sun.

730
00:48:42,504 --> 00:48:45,757
Just remember, don't lock
the bowser's fuel line to the inlet.

731
00:48:45,841 --> 00:48:47,342
Tell me 10 more times.

732
00:48:47,426 --> 00:48:48,885
- You good?
- Right here.

733
00:48:48,969 --> 00:48:51,013
All right. Don't rush.

734
00:48:51,722 --> 00:48:54,391
We've got one chance
to fuel their plane, so let's do it right.

735
00:48:54,641 --> 00:48:56,643
If you ain't a crack shot,
don't aim for the head,

736
00:48:56,727 --> 00:48:57,769
just get Zeke on the ground.

737
00:48:57,853 --> 00:49:00,981
Remember, "Spine's divine,
those knees they work just fine!"

738
00:49:01,064 --> 00:49:02,858
Let's go, lights out!

739
00:49:23,253 --> 00:49:25,505
Alpha in position.

740
00:49:25,589 --> 00:49:27,633
Bravo moving out.

741
00:49:27,716 --> 00:49:30,135
Remember, these things
are drawn to sound.

742
00:49:30,218 --> 00:49:33,305
So I need you close to target
before I bring you the truck.

743
00:49:33,388 --> 00:49:36,099
Now there's only one way
we're getting you on that plane,

744
00:49:36,183 --> 00:49:38,226
and that's quietly.

745
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:08,882
Shit!

746
00:50:08,965 --> 00:50:10,926
God damn it! Shut that thing off!

747
00:50:15,347 --> 00:50:16,765
Looks like we just woke the dead.

748
00:50:17,933 --> 00:50:19,017
Out of respect for others,

749
00:50:19,101 --> 00:50:20,811
please turn off all pagers
and cell phones.

750
00:50:23,939 --> 00:50:25,482
We got to move.

751
00:50:26,191 --> 00:50:28,110
We've got to get out of here, let's move!

752
00:50:34,658 --> 00:50:35,867
Go, go, go!

753
00:50:45,836 --> 00:50:47,087
I'm gonna clear a path through Zeke!

754
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:48,630
You pedal like hell!

755
00:50:51,174 --> 00:50:53,635
Come on, boys,
I need head shots! Tap 'em out!

756
00:50:53,719 --> 00:50:55,470
I want to see some Zeke on the ground!

757
00:51:33,383 --> 00:51:36,052
You're kidding me.
I'm a God damn Zeke.

758
00:51:37,387 --> 00:51:39,848
I got you, Captain. Just say the word.

759
00:51:40,557 --> 00:51:43,351
It's all right, boys. I got this one.

760
00:51:45,729 --> 00:51:47,355
- God damn it.
- We got enough!

761
00:51:47,939 --> 00:51:49,858
We need to detach the fuel line!

762
00:51:51,568 --> 00:51:53,570
Israel better pay off.

763
00:52:03,538 --> 00:52:05,332
All right, I have instrument,
but only on single prop.

764
00:52:05,415 --> 00:52:06,541
You'll have to talk me through it.

765
00:52:09,711 --> 00:52:10,962
Okay, we're clear.

766
00:52:11,046 --> 00:52:12,506
Okay. Give me all the lights.

767
00:52:15,217 --> 00:52:16,843
Switch on the anti-icing.

768
00:52:16,927 --> 00:52:17,928
- Where?
- The red knob.

769
00:52:18,053 --> 00:52:20,430
- Got it, got it.
- Set up our heading 020 for departure.

770
00:52:20,931 --> 00:52:23,225
- We got to move!
- Set flaps 15 degrees.

771
00:52:23,391 --> 00:52:24,726
Flaps 15.

772
00:52:24,893 --> 00:52:27,229
All right, we are all set.
Let's get out of here!

773
00:52:29,773 --> 00:52:31,107
Make it steep.

774
00:52:51,253 --> 00:52:52,587
- Gerry?
- Hi, baby.

775
00:52:52,671 --> 00:52:53,755
Hi. Hi.

776
00:52:55,632 --> 00:52:57,467
I tried to call you.

777
00:52:58,301 --> 00:53:00,136
I know, I was...

778
00:53:00,679 --> 00:53:02,889
It was bad timing, I was running around.

779
00:53:03,431 --> 00:53:04,933
Are you okay?

780
00:53:09,396 --> 00:53:11,898
Yeah, even/thing's okay. I'm okay.

781
00:53:13,567 --> 00:53:15,068
That's the spirit.

782
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:16,736
Yeah.

783
00:53:17,362 --> 00:53:18,655
Listen,

784
00:53:18,989 --> 00:53:20,657
Korea didn't work out.

785
00:53:23,785 --> 00:53:26,329
Now it looks like
we're gonna have to go to Israel.

786
00:53:26,413 --> 00:53:28,540
Try to get some rest on the flight.

787
00:53:29,374 --> 00:53:30,959
How are the kids?

788
00:53:34,462 --> 00:53:35,797
I think...

789
00:53:37,465 --> 00:53:39,968
They're really... They're good.

790
00:53:41,136 --> 00:53:42,971
I got Connie right here.

791
00:53:53,982 --> 00:53:55,150
Baby?

792
00:54:12,167 --> 00:54:14,753
Attention, unidentified aircraft.

793
00:54:14,836 --> 00:54:18,089
You are in a restricted airspace
and not clear for landing.

794
00:54:18,506 --> 00:54:20,675
Jerusalem tower, Reach 394.

795
00:54:20,926 --> 00:54:22,886
Pan, pan, pan.
Request immediate landing.

796
00:54:22,969 --> 00:54:25,430
Contact Mossad,
office of Jurgen Warmbrunn.

797
00:54:25,513 --> 00:54:27,223
Special Envoy, United Nations.

798
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:41,071
Stay with the plane. Be ready to bug out.
I'll be back before dark.

799
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:38,044
The problem with most people is that

800
00:55:38,128 --> 00:55:39,796
they don't believe
something can happen

801
00:55:40,088 --> 00:55:41,923
until it already has.

802
00:55:42,173 --> 00:55:44,092
It's not stupidity or weakness.

803
00:55:45,301 --> 00:55:47,012
It's just human nature.

804
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:51,349
How did you know?

805
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:53,101
Gerald Lane.

806
00:55:53,685 --> 00:55:56,146
Wrote a self-defeating Jeremiad

807
00:55:56,229 --> 00:55:59,399
about his employer,
the U.N., back in 2010.

808
00:56:00,275 --> 00:56:03,236
Caused a few ripples.
Sidelined your career.

809
00:56:04,237 --> 00:56:07,032
Thought you'd have parlayed
those ripples into a self-righteous book.

810
00:56:07,115 --> 00:56:08,783
No nose for profit.

811
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,036
How did Israel know?

812
00:56:11,828 --> 00:56:14,956
We intercepted a communique
from an Indian general

813
00:56:15,373 --> 00:56:17,876
saying they were
fighting the Rakshasha.

814
00:56:17,959 --> 00:56:20,545
Translation, zombies.

815
00:56:20,962 --> 00:56:23,214
Technically undead.

816
00:56:25,967 --> 00:56:27,385
Jurgen Warmbrunn.

817
00:56:27,469 --> 00:56:29,888
High-ranking official in the Mossad.

818
00:56:30,221 --> 00:56:34,976
Described as sober, efficient,
not terribly imaginative.

819
00:56:35,477 --> 00:56:38,605
And yet you build a wall
because you read a communique

820
00:56:38,688 --> 00:56:40,857
that mentions the word "zombie"?

821
00:56:42,025 --> 00:56:45,695
Well, when put like that,
I'd be skeptical as well.

822
00:56:46,529 --> 00:56:48,573
In the '30s, Jews refused to believe

823
00:56:48,656 --> 00:56:51,159
they could be sent
to concentration camps.

824
00:56:51,451 --> 00:56:55,663
In '72, we refused to fathom
we'd be massacred in the Olympics.

825
00:56:56,164 --> 00:57:00,293
In the month before October 1973,
we saw Arab troop movements,

826
00:57:00,376 --> 00:57:03,129
and we unanimously agreed
they didn't pose a threat.

827
00:57:03,922 --> 00:57:08,301
Well, a month later, the Arab attack
almost drove us into the sea.

828
00:57:08,968 --> 00:57:11,346
So we decided to make a change.

829
00:57:12,388 --> 00:57:13,640
A change?

830
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:15,475
The Tenth Man.

831
00:57:16,851 --> 00:57:18,812
If nine of us
look at the same information

832
00:57:18,895 --> 00:57:21,439
and arrive at the exact same conclusion,

833
00:57:21,523 --> 00:57:24,192
it's the duty of the tenth man
to disagree.

834
00:57:24,651 --> 00:57:27,070
No matter how improbable it may seem,

835
00:57:27,153 --> 00:57:29,197
the tenth man has to start digging

836
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,574
on the assumption
that the other nine are wrong.

837
00:57:33,701 --> 00:57:35,203
And you were that tenth man.

838
00:57:36,121 --> 00:57:37,163
Precisely.

839
00:57:43,545 --> 00:57:47,924
Since everyone assumed that this talk of
zombies was cover for something else,

840
00:57:48,007 --> 00:57:51,094
I began my investigation
on the assumption

841
00:57:51,177 --> 00:57:55,390
that when they said "zombies,"
they meant zombies.

842
00:57:56,558 --> 00:57:58,101
Was patient zero from India?

843
00:57:58,393 --> 00:57:59,686
That's the problem.

844
00:57:59,769 --> 00:58:01,312
There's so many
potential sources in play

845
00:58:01,396 --> 00:58:03,189
that no one knows where it began.

846
00:58:04,149 --> 00:58:06,067
The organ trade in Germany.

847
00:58:06,568 --> 00:58:10,280
Strange examples of violent behavior
across the Asian peninsulas.

848
00:58:11,239 --> 00:58:14,909
Meanwhile, the zombie plague keeps
spreading, and we do what we can.

849
00:58:16,828 --> 00:58:19,080
These are
the Jerusalem Salvation Gates.

850
00:58:20,165 --> 00:58:21,666
Two of 10 portals

851
00:58:21,749 --> 00:58:24,544
through the security perimeter
into fortified Israel.

852
00:58:29,132 --> 00:58:30,925
You're letting people in.

853
00:58:31,342 --> 00:58:34,429
Every human being we save
is one less zombie to fight.

854
00:59:16,638 --> 00:59:17,972
It's okay.

855
00:59:44,832 --> 00:59:48,503
If I could get into India, where
would I start? Who would I speak with?

856
00:59:48,586 --> 00:59:50,505
India's a black hole.

857
00:59:50,588 --> 00:59:52,590
Forget about patient zero.

858
00:59:52,674 --> 00:59:55,218
I can't do that.
It's too late for me to build a wall.

859
00:59:59,806 --> 01:00:01,933
I'm running out of time. I need specifics.

860
01:00:02,016 --> 01:00:04,143
- I need answers...
- I don't have answers.

861
01:00:04,227 --> 01:00:06,354
All you can do is find a way to hide.

862
01:00:12,652 --> 01:00:14,195
Get troops down there.

863
01:00:27,250 --> 01:00:28,751
It's too loud! It's too loud!

864
01:00:33,214 --> 01:00:34,674
They're coming over the top!

865
01:00:45,852 --> 01:00:46,936
Shit!

866
01:00:48,146 --> 01:00:49,981
Command, we have a breach
at Salvation Gate.

867
01:00:50,064 --> 01:00:51,649
They're coming over the wall!

868
01:01:33,524 --> 01:01:36,277
Get him to Jaffa Gate.

869
01:01:54,629 --> 01:01:56,964
She'll get you out of here,
she'll get you to your plane!

870
01:02:21,948 --> 01:02:23,616
Stay low!

871
01:02:23,699 --> 01:02:25,243
Wrong way! Wrong way!

872
01:02:26,536 --> 01:02:29,664
Go to landing point B.

873
01:02:30,373 --> 01:02:32,875
Roger, we are inbound
to landing point B.

874
01:03:38,566 --> 01:03:40,735
Hawk 5, almost there.
E.T.A. one minute.

875
01:03:42,028 --> 01:03:44,655
Hawk 5. Hawk 5,
you're patched in. Over.

876
01:03:44,739 --> 01:03:46,782
This is Hawk 5. Listen carefully.

877
01:03:47,325 --> 01:03:50,620
The city is breached,
and they're heading towards the airport.

878
01:06:03,919 --> 01:06:05,171
One thousand one.

879
01:06:05,254 --> 01:06:06,547
One thousand two.

880
01:06:06,631 --> 01:06:08,924
One thousand three. One thousand four.

881
01:06:10,593 --> 01:06:12,011
One thousand five.

882
01:06:12,887 --> 01:06:14,180
One thousand six.

883
01:06:14,805 --> 01:06:16,223
One thousand seven.

884
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:18,934
One thousand eight.

885
01:06:23,022 --> 01:06:24,148
We got to move.

886
01:06:35,242 --> 01:06:36,452
You'll be all right.

887
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:39,413
You're not gonna turn.
You're not gonna turn!

888
01:06:41,957 --> 01:06:43,292
We got to move.

889
01:06:44,210 --> 01:06:45,252
We got to move!

890
01:07:10,778 --> 01:07:12,279
5 going down.

891
01:07:19,578 --> 01:07:20,705
Chopper 5 is down.

892
01:07:20,788 --> 01:07:22,373
I say again, chopper 5 is down.

893
01:07:22,456 --> 01:07:24,250
L.Z. is overrun.

894
01:07:24,959 --> 01:07:28,838
Tower, Reach 394.
Requesting immediate departure.

895
01:07:29,130 --> 01:07:31,215
Tower to 394. Proceed to runway four.

896
01:07:31,298 --> 01:07:32,550
Good luck out there.

897
01:07:49,734 --> 01:07:50,901
No!

898
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:56,157
There! That one!

899
01:08:03,330 --> 01:08:04,749
Stop. Stop.

900
01:08:24,393 --> 01:08:25,561
Go! Go!

901
01:08:38,699 --> 01:08:40,034
Get them out of here!

902
01:08:44,914 --> 01:08:47,750
Stay calm, please. Stay calm.

903
01:08:57,843 --> 01:08:59,804
Come on. Go, go, go.

904
01:09:06,727 --> 01:09:07,812
What's your destination?

905
01:09:07,895 --> 01:09:09,939
I don't know. We were headed here,
but I don't know.

906
01:11:17,483 --> 01:11:19,193
I'm Gerry, by the way.

907
01:11:20,486 --> 01:11:21,570
Segen.

908
01:11:22,571 --> 01:11:23,697
Segen.

909
01:11:24,698 --> 01:11:25,908
First or last?

910
01:11:27,076 --> 01:11:28,410
Just Segen.

911
01:11:28,786 --> 01:11:29,787
So, what we're doing,

912
01:11:29,870 --> 01:11:31,622
we've got to change this bandage
and we're gonna clean it.

913
01:11:31,705 --> 01:11:32,831
Okay?

914
01:11:37,044 --> 01:11:38,963
You okay? Okay?

915
01:11:43,217 --> 01:11:44,343
Okay.

916
01:11:47,513 --> 01:11:49,306
Come on, gut up. Gut up.

917
01:11:50,808 --> 01:11:52,101
Here we go.

918
01:11:54,061 --> 01:11:55,229
We're almost there.

919
01:11:56,397 --> 01:11:58,399
Okay. Big breaths.

920
01:11:58,899 --> 01:12:01,485
Let's get this over fast. Big breaths.

921
01:12:02,403 --> 01:12:03,570
Here we go.

922
01:12:07,950 --> 01:12:10,077
Come on. Good.

923
01:12:11,161 --> 01:12:13,080
Last step. Last step.

924
01:12:13,747 --> 01:12:14,790
Big breath.

925
01:12:16,667 --> 01:12:19,420
Good job. There it is. Okay.

926
01:12:23,007 --> 01:12:25,718
Okay. Okay, I think you've earned this.

927
01:12:29,346 --> 01:12:30,848
Very good. Okay.

928
01:12:32,016 --> 01:12:33,350
You a doctor?

929
01:12:33,851 --> 01:12:34,935
No.

930
01:12:35,352 --> 01:12:36,979
I've had some training in the field.

931
01:12:38,022 --> 01:12:40,024
How did you know?

932
01:12:41,025 --> 01:12:43,277
Cutting it off...
How did you know it would work?

933
01:12:43,652 --> 01:12:44,987
I didn't.

934
01:12:48,907 --> 01:12:51,452
Now I'm just a liability.

935
01:12:54,204 --> 01:12:55,622
This prick

936
01:12:55,706 --> 01:12:58,083
stands right in the mix,

937
01:12:58,167 --> 01:12:59,376
while seven or eight of them

938
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:01,628
turn Zeke all at the same time.

939
01:13:01,712 --> 01:13:03,589
Is that how you tweaked your leg?

940
01:13:04,673 --> 01:13:06,675
No, shit's been bugging me a while.

941
01:13:07,509 --> 01:13:09,678
Got no time for his lucky ass.

942
01:13:10,888 --> 01:13:13,515
Now, the hard pan' is seeing the crumbs

943
01:13:13,599 --> 01:13:15,225
for the clues they are.

944
01:13:17,436 --> 01:13:19,354
And sometimes the thing you thought

945
01:13:19,563 --> 01:13:22,858
was the most brutal aspect of the virus

946
01:13:24,109 --> 01:13:26,612
turns out to be the chink in its armor.

947
01:13:26,904 --> 01:13:28,197
I don't have answers.

948
01:13:30,991 --> 01:13:33,994
All you can do is find a way to hide.

949
01:13:51,428 --> 01:13:52,513
Gerry?

950
01:13:52,596 --> 01:13:53,972
Are you okay? Where are you, baby?
What's happening?

951
01:13:54,056 --> 01:13:55,140
I love you. I'm sorry.

952
01:13:55,224 --> 01:13:56,391
But you've got to get Thierry now.

953
01:13:56,475 --> 01:13:57,518
I'll find him.

954
01:14:00,646 --> 01:14:02,606
- Thierry! Thierry.
- Excuse me. Karin.

955
01:14:02,689 --> 01:14:04,024
Gerry needs you. I love you.

956
01:14:05,359 --> 01:14:06,693
Gerry? Where are you?

957
01:14:07,111 --> 01:14:08,278
On the last flight out.

958
01:14:08,362 --> 01:14:10,405
Listen, my phone is dying
and I need some quick intel.

959
01:14:10,489 --> 01:14:12,574
You gotta locate the closest
medical research facility.

960
01:14:12,658 --> 01:14:15,452
A C.D.C., a W.H.O.,
something that makes vaccines.

961
01:14:15,536 --> 01:14:17,579
- And the closest airport to it.
- I don't understand.

962
01:14:18,163 --> 01:14:19,456
No time to explain.

963
01:14:19,540 --> 01:14:20,582
Just make it happen, man.

964
01:14:20,666 --> 01:14:21,834
Okay, okay.

965
01:14:22,084 --> 01:14:24,878
But, Gerry,
I still don't know where you are.

966
01:14:31,051 --> 01:14:32,261
Well, go and find out what he needs.

967
01:14:34,138 --> 01:14:35,639
You're gonna want to take this.

968
01:14:37,432 --> 01:14:38,559
Take it.

969
01:14:50,529 --> 01:14:51,905
Your battery is dead.

970
01:14:53,448 --> 01:14:56,118
We made contact
with Cardiff Airport, Wales.

971
01:14:56,201 --> 01:14:58,370
Your people directed us.

972
01:14:58,453 --> 01:15:01,165
There is W.H.O.
research facility nearby,

973
01:15:01,248 --> 01:15:03,834
but they are not sure
it's still operational.

974
01:15:03,917 --> 01:15:05,127
This is location.

975
01:15:05,586 --> 01:15:06,920
Can we make it?

976
01:15:15,971 --> 01:15:18,098
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your Captain.

977
01:15:18,182 --> 01:15:20,601
I'm glad to report that
we are on our final approach

978
01:15:20,684 --> 01:15:22,311
to Cardiff Airport in Wales.

979
01:15:22,394 --> 01:15:25,105
All European airports
are under lockdown.

980
01:15:25,189 --> 01:15:29,276
But we have been given
priority status and cleared for landing.

981
01:15:29,359 --> 01:15:32,029
We will be allowed to disembark.

982
01:15:32,946 --> 01:15:35,324
We are very, very lucky.

983
01:16:00,224 --> 01:16:02,226
Hey. Who do you belong to?

984
01:17:06,331 --> 01:17:07,416
What's there?

985
01:17:07,499 --> 01:17:08,542
What is it?

986
01:17:12,587 --> 01:17:14,798
You... Bags.

987
01:17:16,174 --> 01:17:17,884
We need trolley and bags.

988
01:19:22,801 --> 01:19:25,137
Mayday, mayday, mayday!
Bravo 160 heavy.

989
01:19:25,220 --> 01:19:26,721
Emergency descent!

990
01:20:18,523 --> 01:20:19,733
Prepare for impact.

991
01:22:35,869 --> 01:22:37,203
Got to move.

992
01:23:44,270 --> 01:23:45,605
Come on, come on.

993
01:24:06,918 --> 01:24:08,253
Give me something good.

994
01:24:08,336 --> 01:24:10,714
Sir, Cardiff Airport
lost contact with the plane.

995
01:24:10,797 --> 01:24:13,091
Lane is M.l.A. I'm sorry, sir.

996
01:24:28,106 --> 01:24:30,608
Chopper inbound for
immediate relocation.

997
01:24:30,692 --> 01:24:31,901
I say again.

998
01:24:31,985 --> 01:24:34,571
All non-essential personnel
given F-6 status

999
01:24:34,654 --> 01:24:37,198
need to report for immediate relocation.

1000
01:24:39,325 --> 01:24:40,577
Ma'am?

1001
01:24:40,952 --> 01:24:42,829
Thierry would like a word with you.

1002
01:24:49,335 --> 01:24:51,254
Captain, it's only been 48 hours.

1003
01:24:51,337 --> 01:24:54,841
He's a resourceful man. There's every
chance he could have survived.

1004
01:24:54,924 --> 01:24:58,011
Sir, I gave him my word
we would look after his family.

1005
01:24:58,553 --> 01:25:00,054
Yes, sir. I understand.

1006
01:25:04,267 --> 01:25:07,562
Okay. Let's go. We're good.

1007
01:25:54,192 --> 01:25:55,443
Daddy!

1008
01:26:06,663 --> 01:26:08,248
Daddy!

1009
01:26:08,665 --> 01:26:09,666
Daddy!

1010
01:27:15,982 --> 01:27:18,067
You're a tough bastard.

1011
01:27:18,151 --> 01:27:19,485
And a lucky one.

1012
01:27:20,153 --> 01:27:21,654
Who are you?

1013
01:27:23,531 --> 01:27:26,618
I came here with a... With a woman.

1014
01:27:26,701 --> 01:27:28,995
Is she still...

1015
01:27:29,787 --> 01:27:33,166
Who are you?
Why have you come here?

1016
01:27:37,921 --> 01:27:39,297
Why do you keep looking at him?

1017
01:27:40,673 --> 01:27:42,759
'Cause he's the one in charge.

1018
01:27:47,013 --> 01:27:48,431
You know what this place is?

1019
01:27:48,973 --> 01:27:50,767
Of course I do. That's why I'm here.

1020
01:27:50,850 --> 01:27:53,353
Then you understand
how this must look to us.

1021
01:27:54,938 --> 01:27:56,022
This

1022
01:27:56,606 --> 01:27:58,441
is important to you?

1023
01:27:59,484 --> 01:28:01,736
- How long have I been out?
- Three days.

1024
01:28:01,986 --> 01:28:03,196
Give me the phone.

1025
01:28:03,404 --> 01:28:04,739
Just give me the phone.

1026
01:28:04,989 --> 01:28:07,116
Give me the God damn phone!
Give me the phone!

1027
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:09,035
As soon as you answer my question.

1028
01:28:10,870 --> 01:28:12,038
Call it.

1029
01:28:13,039 --> 01:28:15,375
Call the number,
they'll tell you who I am. Call it.

1030
01:28:26,552 --> 01:28:27,595
Gerry?

1031
01:28:28,054 --> 01:28:30,223
- Yeah, I'm here. I'm here.
- My God.

1032
01:28:30,848 --> 01:28:32,350
We thought you were dead.

1033
01:28:32,517 --> 01:28:33,851
Gerry, where are you?

1034
01:28:34,185 --> 01:28:36,229
Thierry, I'm with
a couple of nervous gentlemen.

1035
01:28:36,312 --> 01:28:37,897
They need some bona fides
before I can speak with you.

1036
01:28:37,981 --> 01:28:39,023
Of course.

1037
01:28:39,649 --> 01:28:41,275
This is Thierry Umutoni.

1038
01:28:42,026 --> 01:28:44,195
Deputy Secretary-General.
United Nations.

1039
01:28:44,570 --> 01:28:46,239
To whom am I speaking?

1040
01:28:46,572 --> 01:28:47,657
Where's Karin?

1041
01:28:48,825 --> 01:28:50,827
Thierry, why didn't Karin answer?

1042
01:28:56,082 --> 01:28:57,250
I'm sorry, Gerry.

1043
01:28:57,667 --> 01:28:59,002
I did what I could.

1044
01:29:01,462 --> 01:29:02,755
What does that mean?

1045
01:29:02,839 --> 01:29:04,549
You've got to calm down.
No, stop! Stop.

1046
01:29:04,632 --> 01:29:06,300
You're going to hurt yourself.

1047
01:29:25,111 --> 01:29:26,112
You're okay.

1048
01:29:28,573 --> 01:29:31,576
His family has been sent
to a refugee camp in Nova Scotia.

1049
01:29:32,535 --> 01:29:34,287
I'm sure they'll be safe.

1050
01:29:34,579 --> 01:29:38,499
Are you? Thierry told you
who I am and what I used to do, right?

1051
01:29:38,624 --> 01:29:39,625
Yeah.

1052
01:29:39,709 --> 01:29:41,961
Then trust me when
I tell you they're not safe.

1053
01:29:44,756 --> 01:29:46,090
I understand how you feel.

1054
01:29:46,424 --> 01:29:47,884
- Do you? Yes?
- Yes.

1055
01:29:48,301 --> 01:29:49,802
Do you have a family?

1056
01:29:50,887 --> 01:29:52,221
- No.
- No.

1057
01:29:52,597 --> 01:29:55,308
Then you couldn't possibly understand,
could you?

1058
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:58,436
I lost my son and wife in Rome.

1059
01:30:00,438 --> 01:30:02,940
Rather, I lost my son to

1060
01:30:04,650 --> 01:30:07,487
something that had once been my wife.

1061
01:30:10,823 --> 01:30:13,159
We have all lost someone, Mr. Lane.

1062
01:30:14,285 --> 01:30:16,412
In your case, there is hope at least.

1063
01:30:16,496 --> 01:30:17,789
I'm sorry.

1064
01:30:19,665 --> 01:30:20,792
I'm sorry.

1065
01:30:20,875 --> 01:30:22,210
Now,

1066
01:30:23,294 --> 01:30:25,004
why did you come here?

1067
01:30:26,005 --> 01:30:28,091
What do you need from us?

1068
01:30:28,883 --> 01:30:30,468
Your worst disease.

1069
01:30:34,764 --> 01:30:36,099
He wants a what?

1070
01:30:36,182 --> 01:30:37,683
Deadly pathogen.

1071
01:30:38,184 --> 01:30:39,977
With a high mortality rate.

1072
01:30:40,686 --> 01:30:43,106
- But curable.
- Okay, well...

1073
01:30:43,189 --> 01:30:45,566
You'd want a bacteria
rather than a virus,

1074
01:30:45,650 --> 01:30:46,901
I would think. Typhus?

1075
01:30:47,693 --> 01:30:49,195
Meningitis. Scarlet Fever.

1076
01:30:49,278 --> 01:30:50,446
Rocky Mountain Fever.

1077
01:30:51,030 --> 01:30:53,366
Anyway, excuse me, what's this for?

1078
01:30:53,658 --> 01:30:57,495
Mr. Lane believes we can use
such a disease against the undead.

1079
01:30:58,955 --> 01:31:01,207
I would give you points
for originality, Mr. Lane,

1080
01:31:01,290 --> 01:31:03,209
if we hadn't already tried that, first thing.

1081
01:31:03,334 --> 01:31:09,048
One of the many things a virus or
bacteria needs to thrive is a live host.

1082
01:31:09,173 --> 01:31:10,591
A functioning circulatory system.

1083
01:31:10,716 --> 01:31:12,844
I'm afraid it boils down
to one simple fact...

1084
01:31:12,927 --> 01:31:14,595
You can't make a dead person sick.

1085
01:31:16,097 --> 01:31:17,598
It's not for them.

1086
01:31:18,349 --> 01:31:19,851
It's for us.

1087
01:31:21,561 --> 01:31:23,980
I believe these things have a weakness.

1088
01:31:24,689 --> 01:31:26,607
And that weakness is weakness.

1089
01:31:27,108 --> 01:31:28,442
Our weakness.

1090
01:31:28,860 --> 01:31:31,237
I have witnessed them
literally bypass people.

1091
01:31:31,404 --> 01:31:34,073
Walk right around them like
a river around a rock. Why?

1092
01:31:34,907 --> 01:31:37,201
I think, because those people were sick.

1093
01:31:37,743 --> 01:31:39,078
I think they were terminal.

1094
01:31:39,162 --> 01:31:40,580
And these things could sense it.

1095
01:31:40,913 --> 01:31:42,999
I think they're spreading a pathogen,

1096
01:31:43,082 --> 01:31:44,792
and they need a healthy host.

1097
01:31:45,042 --> 01:31:47,170
But even if you're right, I mean,
infecting the populace

1098
01:31:47,253 --> 01:31:49,422
with a lethal illness is not exactly a cure.

1099
01:31:49,922 --> 01:31:52,383
It's not a cure. It's camouflage.

1100
01:31:56,012 --> 01:31:57,346
It's camouflage.

1101
01:32:01,893 --> 01:32:03,769
There's a natural precedent.

1102
01:32:03,978 --> 01:32:07,481
Hungry predators
will avoid diseased bodies.

1103
01:32:07,940 --> 01:32:10,526
Equipped with the right pathogen,
our troops

1104
01:32:10,610 --> 01:32:12,862
would be essentially
invisible to the enemy.

1105
01:32:13,946 --> 01:32:16,949
You understand the only way
to prove this theory of yours is

1106
01:32:17,491 --> 01:32:18,868
for some idiot to infect themselves

1107
01:32:18,951 --> 01:32:20,912
with a lethal pathogen and then...

1108
01:32:22,079 --> 01:32:24,957
...meet with her, face to face.

1109
01:32:28,294 --> 01:32:29,420
Yes.

1110
01:32:30,087 --> 01:32:32,173
Do we have what we need to try it?

1111
01:32:32,256 --> 01:32:33,466
We have all he could want.

1112
01:32:34,217 --> 01:32:36,802
Typhus, H1N1, SARS.

1113
01:32:37,428 --> 01:32:39,096
The problem is,

1114
01:32:39,180 --> 01:32:41,182
they're all stored in B-Wing.

1115
01:32:42,141 --> 01:32:43,893
What's the matter with B-Wing?

1116
01:32:45,394 --> 01:32:48,481
Dr. Spellman. Our chief vaccinologist.

1117
01:32:49,857 --> 01:32:52,610
Within hours of the outbreak,
he'd been sent blood samples

1118
01:32:52,693 --> 01:32:54,862
to try and isolate the pathogenic cause.

1119
01:32:58,741 --> 01:33:00,243
Unfortunately...

1120
01:33:04,789 --> 01:33:06,123
This is B-Wing now.

1121
01:33:13,089 --> 01:33:14,882
God damn it.

1122
01:33:19,136 --> 01:33:20,388
How many?

1123
01:33:21,264 --> 01:33:22,431
How many are there?

1124
01:33:22,515 --> 01:33:24,350
There were 80 people working there.

1125
01:33:29,021 --> 01:33:30,856
I've never seen them move like that.

1126
01:33:30,940 --> 01:33:32,191
They're dormant.

1127
01:33:32,692 --> 01:33:34,694
They're awaiting stimulus.

1128
01:33:35,820 --> 01:33:36,862
NOW, this

1129
01:33:37,905 --> 01:33:39,365
is vault 139.

1130
01:33:39,907 --> 01:33:41,701
That's where your samples would be.

1131
01:33:42,952 --> 01:33:45,329
This is the skybridge.

1132
01:33:46,580 --> 01:33:48,916
That connects B-Wing
to the main building here.

1133
01:33:49,875 --> 01:33:54,171
And this, is the only thing
standing between us and the skybridge.

1134
01:33:54,338 --> 01:33:55,381
So,

1135
01:33:57,216 --> 01:33:59,051
what do you propose, Mr. Lane?

1136
01:34:13,983 --> 01:34:15,651
You are not serious.

1137
01:34:15,735 --> 01:34:19,071
B-Wing's a maze.
They'll never make it back alone.

1138
01:34:19,613 --> 01:34:21,449
We don't even know
if his theory is correct.

1139
01:34:21,532 --> 01:34:24,452
Well, I know I'm not asking
one of you to take him there.

1140
01:34:26,912 --> 01:34:28,581
Each has its merits.

1141
01:34:33,377 --> 01:34:35,880
- Last resort.
-It's too loud.

1142
01:34:38,090 --> 01:34:39,258
Let's go.

1143
01:34:41,594 --> 01:34:42,970
Try not to kill one.

1144
01:34:44,764 --> 01:34:48,100
It only makes
the rest of them more aggressive.

1145
01:34:49,143 --> 01:34:50,311
Yeah.

1146
01:35:07,453 --> 01:35:08,871
You sure you want to do this?

1147
01:35:09,622 --> 01:35:11,749
Of course I'm not. Let's go.

1148
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:13,626
Good luck.

1149
01:35:15,002 --> 01:35:16,629
See you all shortly.

1150
01:35:21,675 --> 01:35:22,968
Good luck.

1151
01:35:26,430 --> 01:35:30,309
If anything comes down this hall before
we do, you seal these doors for good.

1152
01:35:30,559 --> 01:35:32,520
- Understood?
- Okay.

1153
01:37:59,208 --> 01:38:00,543
There they are.

1154
01:38:40,499 --> 01:38:41,500
Go, go.

1155
01:38:57,182 --> 01:38:58,392
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.

1156
01:38:58,851 --> 01:39:00,019
Come on!

1157
01:39:22,958 --> 01:39:24,877
They're fine. They're fine.

1158
01:39:59,161 --> 01:40:00,496
Shit.

1159
01:40:23,894 --> 01:40:26,063
The vault we need is in 139.

1160
01:41:02,766 --> 01:41:03,934
Go!

1161
01:41:08,439 --> 01:41:09,773
Oh, my God.

1162
01:41:16,113 --> 01:41:17,614
Left, left, left!

1163
01:41:19,324 --> 01:41:20,659
What are you doing?

1164
01:41:20,993 --> 01:41:22,494
She'll get you to the vault.

1165
01:42:39,613 --> 01:42:40,864
That's the vault.

1166
01:42:40,948 --> 01:42:42,282
- We can make it.
- No, we can't.

1167
01:42:44,576 --> 01:42:46,203
We can't make it. Let's go!

1168
01:43:11,812 --> 01:43:12,855
They're not gonna make it.

1169
01:43:12,938 --> 01:43:14,523
You heard what Javi said,
we cannot open it.

1170
01:43:14,606 --> 01:43:15,941
They're not alone, we can't open it!

1171
01:43:16,024 --> 01:43:17,401
They are coming back!

1172
01:43:19,444 --> 01:43:21,280
We can't leave them there.

1173
01:43:21,738 --> 01:43:22,823
Come on!

1174
01:43:25,617 --> 01:43:27,077
Open the door!

1175
01:43:29,580 --> 01:43:30,956
- Run!
- Run!

1176
01:43:31,123 --> 01:43:33,625
Run! Faster, come on!

1177
01:43:33,834 --> 01:43:34,918
Run!

1178
01:43:35,961 --> 01:43:37,588
In, in, in!

1179
01:43:43,969 --> 01:43:45,304
Come on!

1180
01:43:46,138 --> 01:43:47,973
Now where is Gerry?

1181
01:43:50,100 --> 01:43:52,436
Where is he, where is he, where is he?

1182
01:43:53,896 --> 01:43:56,064
Come on, come on, where are you?

1183
01:45:09,721 --> 01:45:11,473
5-6-9-6-4.

1184
01:45:12,849 --> 01:45:15,102
5-6-9-6-4.

1185
01:45:44,089 --> 01:45:45,590
What happened to Gerry?

1186
01:45:59,604 --> 01:46:02,065
Not that one. Not that one.

1187
01:46:31,428 --> 01:46:32,554
Oh, shit!

1188
01:46:32,637 --> 01:46:33,722
Shit!

1189
01:46:56,203 --> 01:46:57,370
Jesus.

1190
01:46:58,121 --> 01:46:59,790
He's going to inject himself.

1191
01:47:06,046 --> 01:47:08,048
We have no idea
which one's going to work.

1192
01:47:08,131 --> 01:47:10,467
We don't know if any of them will work.

1193
01:47:11,093 --> 01:47:13,512
If he uses anything
he took from that left case,

1194
01:47:14,346 --> 01:47:15,847
he's dead anyway.

1195
01:47:41,540 --> 01:47:43,041
What's he doing?

1196
01:48:34,050 --> 01:48:35,886
How long does he have to wait?

1197
01:48:36,344 --> 01:48:38,889
Before he's infected? Not long, but,

1198
01:48:38,972 --> 01:48:41,600
that's not the question
we're really asking, is it?

1199
01:50:32,585 --> 01:50:33,920
Look at them.

1200
01:50:55,066 --> 01:50:56,693
He just walked right past him!

1201
01:51:02,615 --> 01:51:03,908
He walked right past him!

1202
01:51:04,701 --> 01:51:06,077
Like it was nobody!

1203
01:52:16,648 --> 01:52:17,816
Okay.

1204
01:53:05,905 --> 01:53:07,574
This isn't the end.

1205
01:53:17,375 --> 01:53:18,626
Not even close.

1206
01:53:18,710 --> 01:53:20,920
Hi, there. This is...

1207
01:53:21,004 --> 01:53:22,589
This is Amy. Is anyone out there?

1208
01:53:22,672 --> 01:53:24,507
Hello. I'm trying
to get in contact with anyone.

1209
01:53:24,591 --> 01:53:26,676
We've had some luck
finding people with this transmission.

1210
01:53:26,759 --> 01:53:28,344
We've lost entire cities.

1211
01:53:28,428 --> 01:53:30,763
When there's
no more people left to infect,

1212
01:53:30,847 --> 01:53:33,016
they go dormant. Whole cities are lost.

1213
01:53:33,099 --> 01:53:34,559
The World Health Organization

1214
01:53:34,642 --> 01:53:36,519
reports today that help may soon...

1215
01:53:36,603 --> 01:53:38,605
...a hybridized meningitis strain

1216
01:53:38,688 --> 01:53:40,982
with components of smallpox and H1N1 .

1217
01:53:41,065 --> 01:53:42,775
We still don't know how it started.

1218
01:53:42,984 --> 01:53:44,486
The World Health Organization
has created

1219
01:53:44,569 --> 01:53:47,447
a vaccine that works
as a kind of camouflage,

1220
01:53:47,530 --> 01:53:50,992
making people who receive it
invisible to the infected.

1221
01:53:51,326 --> 01:53:52,535
We bought ourselves some time.

1222
01:53:52,619 --> 01:53:55,038
Volunteer forces
are delivering the vaccine

1223
01:53:55,121 --> 01:53:57,123
to areas that have been cordoned off.

1224
01:53:57,207 --> 01:53:59,959
Distribution efforts
began in earnest on April 10th...

1225
01:54:00,043 --> 01:54:01,419
The importance
of getting the information

1226
01:54:01,503 --> 01:54:03,630
out to those still alive
within the quarantine...

1227
01:54:04,589 --> 01:54:06,299
But it's given us a chance.

1228
01:54:22,732 --> 01:54:24,567
If you can get to a colder area,

1229
01:54:24,651 --> 01:54:26,611
to higher ground,
they move slower on the ground.

1230
01:54:26,778 --> 01:54:29,656
The Battle of Moscow is still raging.

1231
01:54:29,948 --> 01:54:34,619
Initial tests on the so-called camouflage
have been largely successful.

1232
01:54:39,499 --> 01:54:41,793
Others have found a way to push back.

1233
01:54:42,627 --> 01:54:46,089
Move, move! All right, juice 'em up!

1234
01:54:54,764 --> 01:54:57,100
Approaching target.
Permission to engage.

1235
01:54:57,433 --> 01:54:58,768
Permission granted.

1236
01:54:58,851 --> 01:55:01,354
All clear. Light 'em up. Light 'em up.

1237
01:55:03,022 --> 01:55:04,315
It's permanent!

1238
01:55:04,399 --> 01:55:07,610
It's settled, it's settled! It's over with!

1239
01:55:07,694 --> 01:55:09,696
There's no forgiveness in hell!

1240
01:55:09,821 --> 01:55:13,408
Whatever goes to hell, stays in hell!

1241
01:55:13,741 --> 01:55:16,869
This is Station 7 in Nebraska,
broadcasting on the shortwave band.

1242
01:55:16,953 --> 01:55:19,581
If you can fight, fight.

1243
01:55:19,664 --> 01:55:20,832
Head north if you can.

1244
01:55:20,915 --> 01:55:23,876
Hello?
ls there anyone out there hearing this?

1245
01:55:23,960 --> 01:55:25,253
Help each other.

1246
01:55:25,336 --> 01:55:28,298
Mexico City has been
declared a complete loss.

1247
01:55:37,557 --> 01:55:39,350
Be prepared for anything.

1248
01:55:44,731 --> 01:55:46,733
Our war has just begun.
