Prince of Persia - The Sands of Time
IRE

2
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,700
Long ago, in a land far away,

3
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,100
There once rose an empire that 
stretched from the steppes of China,

4
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,700
to the shores of the Mediterranean.

5
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,900
That empire was Persia.

6
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,000
Fierce in battle,

7
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,200
wise in victory,

8
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,400
where the Persian sword went,
order followed

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,600
The Persian King Sharaman
ruled with his brother Nizam

10
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:38,100
upon the principles of loyalty
and brotherhood.

11
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,600
The King had two sons who gave
him great joy.

12
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:49,500
But in the eyes of the gods the
King's family was not yet complete.

13
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,300
Not until the day he witnessed a
single act of courage

14
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,800
by an orphan boy on the streets
of Nasam.

15
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,900
Get out of the way!

16
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,500
Stop!

17
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,800
Stop!

18
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,800
Run!

19
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,700
Run, Dastan!
Run!

20
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,900
Stay here!

21
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,900
Getting away! He's getting away!

22
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,400
Let go of me!

23
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,600
- In the King's name!

24
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,700
- What is your name, boy
- Dastan, Sir.

25
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,100
And your parents?

26
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,400
Boy...

27
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,300
Brother, take him up.

28
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:42,000
Moved by what he saw, the King
adopted the boy Dastan into his family.

29
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,200
A son without no royal blood
and no eye on his throne.

30
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,400
But perhaps there was something
else at work that day.

31
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,700
Something beyond simple understanding.

32
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,600
On that day, a boy from the unlikeliest
of places

33
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:05,100
became, a Prince of Persia.

34
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,900

Completely redone: IRE

36
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,700
The fabled Alomet.
Even more stunning than I imagined.

37
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,200
That is all beauty, Prince.
It's a city like any other.

38
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,800
Soft countries make soft men.

39
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,200
They stooped to treachery and must now pay for it.

40
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,300
The Father made clear, Alomet was not to be touched.

41
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,200
Some consider it sacred.

42
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,000
And since our wise Father isn't here,
the decision rests with me.

43
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:07,000
I'll have one last council with my noble
and my two brothers,

44
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,700
Trusted Garsiv and...

45
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,100
Where's Dastan?

46
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,400
- Come on! I bet my entire month's allowance on this!
  This is embarrassing!
- Why don't you give it a try?!

47
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,500
Give it to them!

48
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,400
Is that all you got?

49
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,900
Prince Dastan!

50
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,200
Where's Prince Dastan?

51
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,600
Prince Dastan isn't here.

52
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,700
Your Highness, please,

53
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,100
Prince Tus convened a war council.

54
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,700
I'm on my way.

55
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,700
Our finest spy
intercepted a caravan,

56
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,300
leaving Alomet.

57
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:58,500
Swords of the best workmanship.
Steel-tipped arrows,

58
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,700
a promise of payment from the
warlord Kosh, to Alomet.

59
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,200
They're selling weapons to our
enemies, Dastan.

60
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,400
An arrow such as this slew 
my horse in Koscan 

61
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,500
Blood will run in Alomet streets
for this,

62
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
or our soldiers
will fall from its walls.

63
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,900
Our orders were to Koscan,
not to attack Alomet.

64
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,800
Wise words, little brother.

65
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,900
Words won't stop our enemies,

66
00:06:21,935 --> 00:06:23,700
once they're armed with Andalucian
blades.

67
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,100
We attack at dawn.

68
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,700
Well if that is your decision,
then let me go in first.

69
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,700
- What do you think, Garsiv?
- I run the Persian army,

70
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,700
Dastan leads a company of street rabble.

71
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,400
They may not be much for manners,
but they're pretty handy in a fight.

72
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,300
The honor of first blood should
be mine.

73
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,400
- Garsiv, you've got your hands on your sword again.
- That's where it should be.

74
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,600
Oh my brothers...[chuckle] ever eager.

75
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,300
It's said the Princess of Alomet is a
beauty without equal.

76
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,900
We'll march into her palace to
see for ourselves. [Chuckling]

77
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,200
There'll be no doubt of your 
courage, Dastan,

78
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,800
but you're not ready for this.

79
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,000
Garsiv's cavalary would lead the way.

80
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,700
Princess Tamina,
the Persian army, my Princess, has not moved on.

81
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:49,100
Their faith has little love for
any truth, other than its own.

82
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,200
Perhaps it would be safer
if you didn't stand so close?

83
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,600
Whatever their faith, their 
bows aren't that strong, nor is their aim.

84
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,600
Gather the Council,

85
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,500
tell them I sit in the High Temple.
I must pray.

86
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:08,300
High Temple? Alomet hasn't
been breached in a thousand years!

87
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,300
Everything changes with time.

88
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,100
We should know this best of all.

89
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,700
Remind me why are we disobeying
your brother's orders?

90
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,900
Because Garsiv only knows how
to attack head-on.

91
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,000
It would be a massacre.

92
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,300
Alamutienii will be busy
the main gate.

93
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,100
We'll slip through the side.

94
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,900
Have you been drinking?!

95
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,400
That's our way in.

96
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,000
There are two gates.
The outer one's easy,

97
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,400
but it's the inner gate that's impossible.

98
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,500
The gate mechanism is protected by
two man-guard towers

99
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,400
Yeah, there's always in, Bis.

100
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,600
You take care of the outer gate.
You leave the impossible one to me.

101
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,600
Yeah, that's how you won't be
happy until you get us all killed.

102
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,100
Ooh, wonderful speed, Bis.
Rousing.

103
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,800
Sound the alarm!

104
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,000
Help!

105
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,500
Hold this.

106
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,300
Watch your back.

107
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,700
- Eastern gate's opened.
- That's Dastan's men. He's gotten in.

108
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,000
Dastan's done it.

109
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,400
Redeploy to the Eastern Gate.

110
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,700
Redeploy to the Eastern Gate!

111
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,900
They've breached the Eastern Gate.

112
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,700
Collapse the passages to the Chamber.

113
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,100
Princess...

114
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,100
Go now, everyone.

115
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,800
You know what you must do.

116
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,400
Alomet must be kept safe.

117
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,300
Out of the way!

118
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,200
Silly songs and scented smoke will
do nothing for you now!

119
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I think you'll find there's more
to her than that,

120
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,000
hey Garsiv?

121
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,700
So for once, the stories are true.

122
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,100
We know you secretly build weapons
for enemies of Persia.

123
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,500
- Now show us where.
- We have no forges here,

124
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,500
and what weapons we had, you overcame.

125
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,000
Our spies say differently.
You can save a lot of pain.

126
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:08,300
All the pain in the world will
not help you find something that does not exist.

127
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,100
Spoken like one 
wise enough to consider

128
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,500
a political solution.

129
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,200
Join hands with Persia's future King.

130
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,600
I'll die first.

131
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,000
That can be arranged.

132
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,200
Prince Tus!

133
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:55,200
Promise me the people of Alomet
will be treated with mercy.

134
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,100
Hey, the Lion of Persia!
Lion of Persia!

135
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,400
They're calling you
the Lion of Persia!

136
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:17,100
You've never excelled at
following orders, Dastan.

137
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,600
- I have some explaining to do, Tus...
- No. No.

138
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,500
No! You've some celebrating to do.

139
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:29,200
There is, however a tradition.
Since you took the honor of the first assault,

140
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,700
you owe me a gift.
Homage.

141
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,500
What a beautiful dagger!

142
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,200
He's delivered you the city
and its Princess, I think that's homage enough.

143
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,400
So it is.

144
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,300
First dispatch my Prince.
Wonderful news.

145
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,200
Your father's disrupted his prayers
at the Eastern Palace

146
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,300
to join us.

147
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,200
No doubt to commend us
on our great victory.

148
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,100
We've had indication that Alomet
was arming our enemies.

149
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,400
Indications? You've got to have
more than indications 

150
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,700
to occupy a holy city.
With my troops!

151
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:26,000
This, tsk, adventure,
won't sit with our allies.

152
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,300
But I suppose,
you didn't take that into account.

153
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,500
Don't look for your uncle. Boy!

154
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,600
The decisions and its consequences
will rest with me.

155
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,700
I know you're eager 
to wear the crown,

156
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,500
But trust me when I tell you,
you're not ready.

157
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,800
No man would know better than you, Father,

158
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:05,900
because your trust is something I deeply cherish,
I will oversee the search for weapons myself.

159
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,000
I vow I will not stand before you

160
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,000
until I hold proof of Alomet's treachery.

161
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,800
[Cheering] The first step is the hardest!

162
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,600
Brother! Brother!

163
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,400
We've uncovered signs of tunnels on the
eastern edge of the city,

164
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,600
- I'm on my way there now...
- Ah! Ah! But you'll miss your banquet.

165
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,700
You and Garsiv can handle Father in my absence

166
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,500
You do have a gift to honor him with?

167
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,500
Of course!

168
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,200
- Bis, gift.
- What?

169
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:08,800
- It's been momentarily misplaced.
- I knew you'd forget...

170
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,300
The prayer robe of Alomet's regent.

171
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,600
The holiest in Eastern lands,

172
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,500
a gift that a King
will appreciate.

173
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,700
You fought like a champion
for me, Dastan,

174
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,100
gald to return the favor.

175
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,900
A rare jewel.

176
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,100
Present her to the King for
me this evening, Dastan.

177
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,700
You sure you want another wife, brother?

178
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,100
Listen to me, Dastan!

179
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,700
A marriage to the Princess
assures me the loyalty of her people.

180
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,600
Unbound to us, she's a
dangerous liability.

181
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,200
If Father doesn't approve our union,

182
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,700
I want you to end her life
with your own hands.

183
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,800
So, I'm escorted by Prince Dastan,
the Lion of Persia.

184
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,300
Must feel wonderful for winning such acclaim
for destroying such an innocent city.

185
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,300
Ah, pleasure to meet you too, Princess.

186
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,200
Allow me to offer that

187
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,300
if punishing the enemies of
my King is a crime, then it's

188
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,900
one I'll gladly repeat.

189
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,900
Then you are a true prince of Persia,

190
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,100
brutal and without honor.

191
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,700
Don't make the mistake that you
know me, Princess.

192
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,200
Oh? And what more is there?

193
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,100
Wait here with her Highness.

194
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,300
If you can manage it,

195
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,900
I suggest a hint of humility
when you're presented to the King.

196
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,300
For your own good.

197
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,700
You Father's, eh, Uncle?

198
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:49,700
One day, you'll have the pleasure
of being brother to the King, Dastan.

199
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,800
As long as you remember your most important
duty

200
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,100
you should do well.

201
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,200
Oh, and what's that?

202
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,300
Making sure his wine glass stays full.

203
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,900
I'm told that another of my sons

204
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,200
has joined the rank of
great Persian warriors.

205
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,000
Thank you.

206
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,200
We missed you, Father.

207
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:19,100
I...was praying for you and your 
brothers, Dastan.

208
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,900
Family, the bond between brothers

209
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,300
this is the sword that defends our empire.

210
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,100
I pray that that sword
remains strong.

211
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,900
I was hoping my actions would
spare our men into heavy losses.

212
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,500
A good man would have done as you did, Dastan,

213
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:45,200
act boldly and courageously to
bring a victory

214
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,000
and spare lives.

215
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,500
A great man would have stopped
the attack from happening at all,

216
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,800
a great man would have stopped
what he knew to be wrong.

217
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,900
No matter who's ordering.

218
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,500
The boy that I saw in that square,

219
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,900
was capable of being more than just good

220
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,600
but to be great.

221
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:18,700
Well in the meantime, I have a gift for you.

222
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:26,500
Some questions the wisdom of my
bringing a boy from the streets into

223
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:31,200
my family, but I saw a boy
whose blood wasn't noble, 

224
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:35,400
but whose character was,
a King in spirit.

225
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,600
Thank you, Father.

226
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,300
Thank you, Father.

227
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,400
May I present the prayer robe of 
Alomet's regent.

228
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,600
What can I grant you, in return?

229
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,500
Braham!

230
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,100
May I present the Princess Tamina.

231
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,500
Tus wishes to make a union
with her people through marriage,

232
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,900
it is my deepest wish, that 
this wins your approval.

233
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,400
In all my travels,

234
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:23,900
I have never looked upon
a more beautiful city, Your Highness.

235
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,100
You should have seen it before your
horde of camel-riding illiterates descended upon it.

236
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,000
Clear as well that you will make a fine queen.

237
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,700
But, Tus already has enough wives

238
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,600
you, Dastan, might take fewer
chances if such a

239
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,400
jewel waited in your chamber.

240
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:52,600
The Princess of Alomet will be your
your first wife.

241
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,400
Oh, what say you, Dastan?

242
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:04,200
He plunged into a hundred foes without thought

243
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:07,100
but before marriage he stands frozen
with fear,

244
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,600
and, for those who say he is not yet wise!

245
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,100
I need a drink.

246
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,500
- Stand aside!
- Out of my way!

247
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,900
Father!

248
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,800
God help us, the rubies, it's poisoned!

249
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,700
- Somebody help him!
- The robe Dastan gave him!

250
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,300
- Why?
- Somebody help him!

251
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,700
- He's the murderer!
- Somebody help him!

252
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,900
Stop!
Cease him!

253
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:55,600
- Bis! Bis!!
- Come with me!

254
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,300
- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm going to get us out of here!

255
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,300
You're going to need my help!

256
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,500
Come on!

257
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,100
- Close the gate!
- That way!

258
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,900
- Close the gate!
- Get down!

259
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,400
There!
Onto the murderer!

260
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,400
He's on my horse!
He's stole my horse!

261
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,500
My loyal subjects

262
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,300
the whole world grieves at the
death of our beloved King.

263
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,700
We all stricken by his loss.

264
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,600
That the murder came at Prince Dastan's hand

265
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,400
only makes our pain worse.

266
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,800
I did not kill my father.

267
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:12,400
The robe was given to me by my brother
Tus did this.

268
00:28:12,435 --> 00:28:13,800
And now he stands to be crowned king.

269
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,600
I didn't kill my father.

270
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,000
I believe you.

271
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,500
You shouldn't be here.
I shouldn't have let you come.

272
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,200
But you did.

273
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,200
I promised my brother that I'd kill you
if he couldn't have you.

274
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,200
Well, the solution would be to kiss me
and then kill me,

275
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,000
but I have a better solution.

276
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,300
I kill you!

277
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,800
And your problems are solved.

278
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,900
Perhaps we could find another solution!

279
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,500
Well, the solution would be to kiss me
then kill me,

280
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,100
but I have a better solution.

281
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,700
I kill you!

282
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,300
Give back what you stole, Persian!

283
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,400
No!

284
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,400
- Did you see that?
- See what?

285
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,800
Go for that sword again and
I swear that I will break your arm.

286
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,800
Again?

287
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,000
- You used up all the sand.
- What?

288
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,400
What is this?

289
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,400
Incredible!

290
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,300
Releasing the sand
turns back time.

291
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,400
And only the holder of the dagger
is aware of what happened.

292
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:46,200
He could go back and alter events, change time,
and no one knows but him.

293
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,400
How much can it unliken?
Answer me, Princess.

294
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,100
You destroyed my city.

295
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,400
Apparently it wasn't about a weapons audit,
it was about this dagger.

296
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:06,000
After the battle, Tus asked for this dagger as tribute. 
I didn't think anything of it, but now I see.

297
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,500
With it, he could change anything.

298
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,700
He could change a critical moment in battle,

299
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,300
he could foresee the blade of a rival.

300
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,600
He wouldn't just be king,

301
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,200
he would be the most powerful
ruler Persia's ever seen

302
00:31:15,235 --> 00:31:16,300
greater even than my father.

303
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,300
It was all about this dagger.

304
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:21,200
My treacherous brother must be
brought to justice.

305
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,700
And as such I have doubled the
reward for his capture.

306
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,100
Meanwhile I shall strive to protect our empire

307
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,800
as my father would have demanded.

308
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,100
A new reign has begun.

309
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,600
- What are you doing?
- Garsiv can't be far behind us.

310
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,500
She's the most famous horse in the empire.
This would skew his tracks.

311
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,200
Tracks where?
Where are you going?

312
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,000
To Abrat, where my father will be buried.

313
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:47,400
You're wanted for the King's murder
and you're going to march into his funeral

314
00:31:47,435 --> 00:31:50,500
- in alongside thousands of Persian soldiers?
- Well, Nizam will be there. He's the

315
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,700
only one I can trust.
He'll see it was set up by Tus.

316
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,300
Step aside, Princess.

317
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,500
Every road to Abrat will be
covered by Persian troops.

318
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,000
Well, I'm not taking roads,
I'm going through the Valley of the Slaves.

319
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,800
No one goes near that wasteland,
it's filled with murderers and cutthroats.

320
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,500
- Yes, so they say.
- Your whole plan is suicide!

321
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,900
My brother murdered my father,
and it's his blood on my hands

322
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
if I die trying to set that right,
then so be it.

323
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,700
Ah! So you're going to leave me here
in the middle of nowhere? 

324
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:19,700
Noble Dastan abandoning a helpless woman
in the wilderness,

325
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,300
what does your precious honor
have to say about that?

326
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,300
Oh, give me the strength not to kill her.

327
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,100
Mount up, we can't be far behind him.

328
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,300
Without the right sand
it's just another knife.

329
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,100
Not even very sharp.

330
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,200
- This sand is there more of it?
- Of course not.

331
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,900
Where do I find more?

332
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,300
Try standing on your head and
holding your breath.

333
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:11,600
- See what you were looking for, Prince?
- Start walking.

334
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,400
So if you can't prove to your uncle how
the dagger works,

335
00:33:22,435 --> 00:33:23,900
why would he believe you?

336
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,800
It's not your problem, Princess.

337
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:31,100
You know, you really walk like one.
Head held high, chest out, long

338
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,500
stumping strides.
The walk of a self-satisfied Persian prince.

339
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,900
No doubt it has come from being told since birth
the world is yours.

340
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:43,200
- And you actually believing it.
- I wasn't born in the palace like you.

341
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,600
I was born in the slums in Mysaf.

342
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,900
where I lived if I fought 
and I clawed for it.

343
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:53,800
- Then how did you become a Prince?
- King marches in the market one day,

344
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,400
and he...
I don't know...he...

345
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
he found me.

346
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,900
He took me,
he gave me a family, gave me a home.

347
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,300
What you're looking at is the walk of

348
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,800
a man who's just lost everything.

349
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,900
Welcome to the Valley of the Slaves, Your Highness.

350
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,800
I'm desperate for a drop of water.

351
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:37,000
Well that's more than we had
when you emptied our canteen hours ago.

352
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:41,300
I wasn't born in this desert like you Persians,
or shrivelled and angry...

353
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,600
My constitution is much more...delicate.

354
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,800
I think you're being spoiled.

355
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:51,900
The wells of Alomet are famed for
their clean, cold water.

356
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:56,000
Perhaps less time admiring your wells 
and more time guarding your walls,

357
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,700
you wouldn't be here. [chuckling...]

358
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:06,200
Ah, a miracle!
I've silenced the Princess!

359
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,800
Tamina?

360
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,800
Tamina?

361
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,400
Can you hear me?

362
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,500
Yes, Dastan, I hear you.

363
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,700
Do you know where you are, Persian?

364
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,400
And yet you enter still?

365
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,300
In the heart of Sudan is a tribe
of warriors known as the Um'Bakr.

366
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,600
They strike fear into the hearts of
all they cross.

367
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,100
The Um'Bakr are masters of the throwing knife.

368
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:01,000
Wielding blades said to
have been blessed by the Creator himself.

369
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:07,400
Their aim is so murderously accurate
they can decaptitate three men with one strike.

370
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,600
Oh, I wouldn't bother doing that if I were you,

371
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:16,800
Do you know why? This is Seso. He's an Um'Bakr.

372
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:22,500
I have the good fortune of saving his life,
which means that he is now enduringly indebted to me.

373
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,300
So tell me, Persian, is there any good reason
why I shouldn't tell Seso

374
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,000
to put his next throw a little higher?

375
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:12,500
- So? This is the one, eh?
- Yes...

376
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,500
you're right, she's not bad.

377
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,100
She could smell a bit better though.
Still we have a deal.

378
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,300
- Clever Princess.
- Deal? What deal?

379
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:34,500
- Such a noble prince...
- Such a gentle princess...

380
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,600
How taken you were with my ainting act

381
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:39,100
eagerly leaping to assist the fallen...

382
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,500
- Who said you're beautiful?
- There must be a reason why 

383
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,800
you can't take your eyes off me.

384
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,900
You are...
I...I don't trust you.

385
00:37:46,935 --> 00:37:48,000
And you're not my type.

386
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,000
I'm not some desperate slave girl,

387
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,600
- I'm actually capable of voicing my own thoughts.
- Too many for my taste.

388
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,200
Yeah, she'll make a very nice addition.

389
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,700
What do you do with it?

390
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,500
Yes, do tell him, can you not see how concerned he is?

391
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,300
- Give me a moment.
- Yeah.

392
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,700
It's hard for me to admit,
but you were right.

393
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,300
I did see what I was looking for.

394
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:20,400
- Dastan, listen to me.
- When my uncle sees the power of this dagger,

395
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,400
he'll believe me.

396
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,200
Dastan I know ...
I haven't been entirely honest with you.

397
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,800
Oh, but your lies are so clever.

398
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,300
I am the guardian of the Divine Covenant.

399
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,000
- Oh, oh.
- That dagger is sacred.

400
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,300
It was being smuggled to safety
when you stole it

401
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,200
- If the dagger gets into the wrong hands...
- I will take care of your knife.

402
00:38:38,235 --> 00:38:39,600
You don't want to miss this.

403
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,300
You don't understand what's at stake!

404
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,800
This is a matter of the gods, not man!

405
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,800
Your gods, not mine!
Come on!

406
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,300
Come on!

407
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,900
- Ostrich racing?
- Yeah, every Tuesday and Thursday.

408
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:11,600
Whatever they lack in beauty
they make up for in fighting spirit.

409
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,800
And the races are easy to fix!

410
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,200
I heard all these terrible stories of this place.

411
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,800
The black, thirsty slaves? Murdering their masters?
[laughing] There's a good story,

412
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,000

413
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,800
it's well-told everybody, but alas untrue. 

414
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,100
- But skeletons that we saw...
- Ah bull, they're from a gypsy in Pecara.

415
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:33,500
Now I crafted our lurid reputation in order
to fend off

416
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:37,200
the most insiduous evil that's been lurking
this forsaken country of ours.

417
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,700
You know what I'm talking about? Taxes!

418
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:45,100
Now these Persians, their army, their fortresses
their roads, their...

419
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:48,200
Who pays for it all, eh?!
The small businessmen!

420
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:54,000
Yeah, that's why I started a little campaign
to spread some false notoriety

421
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,100
I spread like a veneral disease in a Turkish harem.

422
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,200
Behold the mighty ostrich!! 
[laughing]

423
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,200
Come on, my beauty!

424
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,000
I love this!

425
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:42,000
And the tax collectors stay clear of me
and my customers, everybody's happy.

426
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,700
Hey! Get the girls on!
Get the girls on! Come on! Crowd control! 
[whistling]

427
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,900
Don't just stand there! Run, don't walk!

428
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,600
Hey, you drop anything, you pay for it!
Out of your wages.

429
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,900
Now, don't you look at me like that.
You know what I'm talking about.

430
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,200
Do your job, crowd control!
Thank you!

431
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:05,400
You know, our little arrangement's 
going to work out very well, young man.

432
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,500
Oh ho ho! She's a lively one!
Where did you find her?

433
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,500
In the slave marts of Glor.

434
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:19,100
I was headed to Iraq to trade her for a camel when
she attacked me.

435
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,300
- The camels are safer.

436
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,700
I appreciate your hospitality.
You run a fine establishment.

437
00:41:25,735 --> 00:41:27,500
but if you could give me
the supplies...

438
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,800
You know something, Persian?

439
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,500
You bear a remarkable resemblance to
the disgraced prince who fled

440
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,200
after murdering the king.

441
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:48,800
- Have I told you about the Um'Bakr?
- Yes, you have.

442
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,600
Nothing beats a good story, eh. But yours however,

443
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,200
trading her for a camel, please?

444
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,400
I mean, look at her.
She's worth at least two.

445
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:00,700
And as for you, young man, did you know
your brother has offered a reward

446
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,300
that quite frankly for you that, between you and me,
borders on the obscene?

447
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,000
I'd trade in my mother for
for that kind of gold.

448
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,000
What? And you didn't know what she was like?

449
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,400
Take him down to the Persian outpost.

450
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,600
Wait! Wait!

451
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,900
Nice knife.

452
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,000
- No, no, no, that's worthless.
- Really?

453
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,100
Melt it down for the jewels.

454
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,300
What's the boy doing?!

455
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,200
No! No! You might kill a bird!

456
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:59,600
Hey, over here!

457
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:11,500
- Oh, oh, I wouldn't do that if I were you.
- Get to the tunnel!

458
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,400
Oh look at this. That's it!
No more fermented goat's milk till

459
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,600
after the third race, you hear me?!

460
00:43:19,635 --> 00:43:21,400
Get off, come on!

461
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,100
Get him!
Stop!

462
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,100
- Lift the lever, open the gate!
- Give me the dagger.

463
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,100
- This is not the time...
- Give me the dagger!

464
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,300
Don't think it didn't cross my mind.

465
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,300
Move, Princess!

466
00:43:48,335 --> 00:43:49,700
Get him!

467
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,400
Dastan!

468
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,100
Get him!

469
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:03,600
Looking for this?

470
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:04,700
This? Oops.

471
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,200
Next time you...aargh!

472
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,600
They've all come 
for my father's funeral.

473
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,300
There are a hundred Persian
soldiers watching that gate.

474
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,400
Maybe more.

475
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,500
If you want to stay close to the dagger,
you should help me get into Abrat.

476
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,600
All these foreign dignitaries,
I'm guessing you know a few?

477
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,400
Couldn't you have found somebody lighter?

478
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,100
Dunghals of the Hindu Kush are a noble people.
You should be honored.

479
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,400
Oh yes, terribly.

480
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:23,600
Dastan, where's the dagger?

481
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:27,300
You're welcome to search me for it.
You'll have to be very thorough.

482
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:43,000
Tus isn't here.
He's probably still in Alomet.

483
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,700
The sand that fuels the dagger,
there's more of it in Alomet, isn't there?

484
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:50,900
That's why Tus stays there.

485
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,100
That's what he's got our army searching for.

486
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,500
I have to get a message
to my uncle to meet me.

487
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:57,600
That's impossible.

488
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,000
Difficult but not impossible.

489
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:00,700
- Well, more proof you're insane.
- Why do you look so impressed?

490
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:03,300
Out of the way!
Make way!

491
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,400
- Turn around! Turn around!
- What?

492
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,200
You used to buy those
for me when I was a boy.

493
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:26,800
You used to spit the seeds
on Garsiv.

494
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,400
- You should not have brought me here, Dastan.
- I had no choice, uncle.

495
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:33,600
Follow me.

496
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:56,400
I didn't kill father.

497
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:00,800
- You know that I would never do such a thing.
- Your actions speak otherwise.

498
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,400
But...but I had no choice,
but to flee.

499
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:07,800
Tus gave me that cloak.
He was the one who poisoned it.

500
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:09,700
- Dastan...
- But he's not here, is he?

501
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,100
At his father's funeral,
instead he remains at Alomet.

502
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:14,700
Eyes will see
that our invasion was just.

503
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,900
Search for weapons forges
is important.

504
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,700
Yes, but not if there are none.

505
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:21,100
The invasion of Alomet is a lie.

506
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:24,200
Tus was after power
that's why he murdered father.

507
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,200
And now he searches not after weapons
but for the sand

508
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:32,400
- that fuels a mystical device.
- This is why you brought me here, Dastan?

509
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:33,600
Mystical device?

510
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:36,300
You remember after the battle
you stopped Tus from taking the dagger I'd won?

511
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,600
That dagger is the
reason he invaded Alomet.

512
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:48,100
- This dagger, you have it with you?
- Yes.

513
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:55,900
It has incredible powers.

514
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:01,600
Is this some sort of a joke, Dastan?

515
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,600
What? No, it was in there.

516
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,600
And where is your so-called evidence?

517
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:11,400
Tamina...

518
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:14,700
I...
The...
I...

519
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:20,700
Your hands are burned.

520
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:26,800
Yes, from trying 
to pull the poison cloak off your father.

521
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:30,000
Is something wrong, Dastan?

522
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:31,900
- No, no...
- You certain?

523
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,700
You know that you can trust me, boy.

524
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:41,300
It...it's just that Tus is my brother.

525
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:45,600
- How could he betray me like this?
- I can't say, Dastan.

526
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:50,200
Perhaps he never respected you
as it deserved and he saw you as

527
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:51,400
someone he could use.

528
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:52,800
Someone to keep his wine glass filled.

529
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:54,700
My service to your father was different.

530
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,100
We shared the same blood, Dastan.

531
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:01,000
How many times did Father
speak of you saving him from that lion?

532
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:05,000
- That was his favorite story.
- Yes, of many, yes.

533
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:06,900
No, that was his favorite.

534
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:09,200
I'm afraid you're speaking
in riddles, Dastan.

535
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:14,300
Wait, Dastan!

536
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:07,300
Murderer!

537
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,700
I didn't kill father!

538
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:23,600
Out of the way!
Get out of the way!

539
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:15,500
Get him!

540
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:25,600
What are you doing now?

541
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:04,700
Dnelor ...

542
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:12,300
Prince Garsiv!

543
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:13,200
Where is he?

544
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:14,500
Where is he?!!

545
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:36,700
Garsiv.

546
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:41,700
- I didn't kill father.
- Then god will pardon you.

547
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,000
After your head rolls.

548
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:55,400
We're not fighting with sticks
anymore, little brother.

549
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:07,700
That's all you got?

550
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:30,000
- Your Majesty, I thought you were staying in Alemot.
- Tell me about Dastan, uncle.

551
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,800
Dastan came to Arbat to kill me.
In the market place.

552
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,400
I just got away.

553
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,600
Tus, my death would weaken your young reign.

554
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,300
Dastan hopes to start a rebellion.

555
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,300
- He wants the throne?
- I'm fear so, my Lord.

556
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,600
Putting Dastan on trial would
only give him a stage for his sedition.

557
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:57,400
My advice would be
to avoid a trial.

558
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,00
Don't bring him back to Nasaf for life.

559
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,500
Whatever Dastan's crimes,

560
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,100
a public trial will best communicate
the king I hope to be.

561
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:21,600
Strong. Honoring the rule of law.
We are not savages.

562
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:23,900
You grow more a king every day.

563
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:28,800
Dastan must be found.
He must be brought to justice.

564
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:40,000
I need to speak with our guests.

565
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:44,300
About them my lord. Their practices are unusual.
The servants have seen things,

566
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:46,400
heard strange sounds.

567
00:55:46,635 --> 00:55:48,100
Last week one of the horses vanished.

568
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,500
Well just make sure that the servants keep their
mouths shut

569
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:55,100
or I promise you they will vanish as well.

570
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:00,700
I have another task for you, Hassansin,
but you have to be quick,

571
00:57:00,735 --> 00:57:03,500
- your prey has a head start.
- You brought what I requested?

572
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:16,600
These practices, they don't interfere
with your skills?

573
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:19,200
In a trance we see the visions of far future,

574
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:21,700
vision of death,

575
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,700
Destiny...
and a curse.

576
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,200
In trance we can find anything.

577
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:38,800
Including your nephew,
Prince Dastan.

578
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:43,700
Then I hope you shall see more death...
soon.

579
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:21,200
Get down!
It's a Persian patrol!

580
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,900
Garsiv...

581
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:35,000
What aren't you telling me?

582
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:42,400
The transmen left. Maybe they tired
of your pawnshop for lies and back-stabbing.

583
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:44,300
I had no choice,
but to leave you.

584
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:46,900
I take it your uncle didn't listen?

585
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:50,700
It wasn't Tus that killed my father.
It was Nizam.

586
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:54,200
- Your uncle?
- His hands were burnt.

587
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,300
He said he had been trying to pull off the
cloak that killed my father.

588
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,900
I've gone over and over it in my mind.
He never touched the cloak.

589
00:58:59,935 --> 00:59:01,200
He must have handled it before.

590
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:05,600
It was Nizam that poisoned it.

591
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:10,000
What good does turning back a few
moments of time do my uncle?

592
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:11,200
None.

593
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
He murdered my father for more
than just a dagger.

594
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,100
What aren't you telling me?

595
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,600
Here, you've got quick eyes.

596
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,300
So do I.

597
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:21,900
If you want it back
tell me everything.

598
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:24,700
No more games, no more lies.

599
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:36,900
Can we get out of here?

600
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:47,200
Only a princess could think she
could outrun a sandstorm.

601
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:55,300
Nizam's coming to kill us.
He needs me dead.

602
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,100
I need to know why.

603
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:06,200
In Amolet lies the beating heart
of all life on earth.

604
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:10,100
The Sandglass of the gods.

605
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:14,000
Long ago, the gods looked down on man

606
01:00:14,035 --> 01:00:16,100
but saw only greed and treachery.

607
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:18,400
So they sent a great sandstorm

608
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:21,000
to destroy all, wipe clean the
face of the earth.

609
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:26,100
But one young girl asked the gods to give
mankind another chance.

610
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,000
Offering her life in exchange.

611
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:34,200
Seeing the purity within the gods were
reminded of mankind's potential for good.

612
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,600
So they swept the sands into the Sandglass.

613
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:55,900
The dagger was given to the girl
who saved man,

614
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,000
making her the first Guardian.

615
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:01,700
The dagger blade is the only thing that
can pierce

616
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:04,200
the Sandglass and remove the Sands of Time.

617
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:07,100
But the handle only holds one minute.

618
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:11,100
What if one were to place the Dagger in
the Sandglass and press the jewel button at the same time?

619
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:13,200
Sand would flow through endlessly.

620
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:14,800
Time would flow back as far as you like.

621
01:01:14,835 --> 01:01:16,100
Yes, but it is forbidden.

622
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:27,700
When my father was a boy,
Nizam saved his life hunting.

623
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:32,500
One day, two Princes
were stalking a beautiful buck

624
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:35,300
but they were unaware of a lion
that was stalking them.

625
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:37,800
Nizam saved Sharaman.

626
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:41,300
My father told us this story
over and over again.

627
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:45,600
- I don't understand.
- Nizam wants to go back in time

628
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:48,900
and undo what he did and not save my father,

629
01:01:48,935 --> 01:01:50,100
and let him die.

630
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:55,500
Then he'll be king for a lifetime. And my
brothers would never be born.

631
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,000
The storm's passed.

632
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:35,500
Dastan, the sands contained within
the Sandglass are incredibly powerful.

633
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:42,800
Opening the dagger while it's inside
the Sandglass breaks the seal

634
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:46,300
and destroy the Sandglass 
causing it to crack and shatter.

635
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:49,800
The Sands of Time
can no longer be contained.

636
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:55,700
And they would carry with them the gods' wrath with them once more. 
Destroying everything in their path.

637
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:02,600
And all of mankind will pay for Nizam's treachery.

638
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:06,200
This is what that would be left of us.

639
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:11,000
The secret guardian temple 
outside Alomet is a sanctuary.

640
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:13,600
The once place where the Dagger can be hidden safely

641
01:03:13,635 --> 01:03:15,500
and the only way to stop
this Armageddon.

642
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:19,500
That's the truth, Dastan.

643
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:26,000
Give me the dagger back
so that I can take it there.

644
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,400
No, I can't do that.

645
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:35,900
I'm coming with you.

646
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:38,100
You're going to help me?

647
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,200
We can sit here and chat
or you can sit on the horse.

648
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:00,200
Our journey is blessed.

649
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,900
We'll stop for water and push
for the mountain pass before nightfall.

650
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,200
You enjoy telling me what to do.

651
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:09,800
Only because you're so good at following orders.

652
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:11,400
Yeah, don't press your luck.

653
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:26,500
Dastan!

654
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:31,100
We parted under such rushed circumstances.
We didn't have the chance to say goodbye.

655
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,000
We've been tracking you for a week.

656
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:38,400
That little riot you started,
it went on for two days!

657
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:41,600
My beloved race track.

658
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:45,100
All washed away like footprint in sand.

659
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:47,600
See the nigger there?

660
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:49,800
She's all that's left of 
my gaming empire.

661
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:55,600
And no matter your skills as a promoter
you can organize an ostrich race

662
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,200
with just one ostrich!
Am I right?

663
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:02,500
Yes, sir.
Come with me.

664
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,900
Did you know that ostriches have suicidal tendencies?

665
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:15,400
Look at this poor thing.

666
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:20,900
She used to be a grand champion
and now must watch her day and night

667
01:05:20,935 --> 01:05:22,800
to make sure that she doesn't do anything stupid.

668
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:32,400
So it occured to me the only way to recoup my
tragic losses

669
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:34,600
was to track down the two young lovers

670
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:36,700
who cast the dark cloud upon me.

671
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,500
Ah yes, I'm going to need the
price on your head.

672
01:05:39,535 --> 01:05:41,900
Your brother will be very pleased to see...

673
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:47,700
Sand dervishers, Persian.
They come in as camel...

674
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:50,700
- Sheik, listen to me!
- I'd rather not.

675
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:53,600
- Nice knife.
- Noble Sheik,

676
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:55,700
we are on a sacred journey
to the temple.

677
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:58,900
Temple? What temple? There is nothing more sacred
than Persian gold.

678
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:47,300
- Give me the dagger.
- There are too many of them.

679
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,200
- You can't kill them all. You want to live?
- Give me the dagger!

680
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:13,100
Give me the dagger!

681
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,400
Persian, how did you do that?

682
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:33,600
Instinct.

683
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:48,000
We've got to get out of here.

684
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:55,000
- What happened last night?
- Those vipers were controlled by Hassansins.

685
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:57,100
- Hassansins?
- For years, they were

686
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:59,200
the covert killing force for the Persian kings
but my father ordered

687
01:07:59,235 --> 01:08:00,100
them disbanded.

688
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:03,700
Nizam must have disobeyed my father's orders,
kept them intact.

689
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:06,300
It's an secret government killing activity.

690
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:09,000
- That's why I don't pay taxes.
- We can't stop.

691
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:11,000
Perhaps you can't, but we can.

692
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:13,400
We could use your help getting
to the Temple.

693
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,300
By crossing the Hindu Kush with the
a storm blowing?

694
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:19,100
You attract trouble like flies
around a rotting mango.

695
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:20,900
- Are you insane!
- There's gold in the temple.

696
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,500
More than 10 horses could carry.

697
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:25,900
Tax-free.

698
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:27,400
Sir!

699
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:57,400
Do you have any idea where you're going?

700
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,300
I memorized this path
as a child.

701
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:03,700
Every Princess must.
It's sacred.

702
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:08,400
It's here.

703
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:20,700
The Sanctuary, the one place the
Dagger can be hidden safely.

704
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:23,800
I was expecting to golden statues, waterfalls.

705
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:31,600
Give me back the Dagger,
so I can take it there.

706
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:51,300
Don't cut yourself, Princess.

707
01:09:58,500 --> 01:09:59,700
Hey! Here!

708
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:03,900
Not long dead.
Last night maybe.

709
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:06,900
Tortured first.
Hassansin.

710
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:08,900
Nizam knows this place.

711
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:10,600
All dead.


712
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:15,400
The entire village...

713
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:16,700
- uh, my gold...
- Where you going?

714
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,200
- There is only one way to stop all of this.
- What?

715
01:10:19,235 --> 01:10:20,500
To make sure the Dagger is safe.

716
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:22,600
The Temple holds the stone the
Dagger came from.

717
01:10:22,635 --> 01:10:25,100
What tem...this is a pile of stones and rocks.

718
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:26,800
The first thing we learned
was, all else fails,

719
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:29,000
put the Dagger back in the stone,
the stone will envelop it,

720
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:31,600
pulling it into the mountain,
returning it to the gods.

721
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:43,700
The Original Promise...must be paid.

722
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,200
What Promise?

723
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:49,500
The gods must take
back the life they spared.

724
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:52,500
That means...you'll die.

725
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:04,400
Stay there!
Stay there!

726
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:07,900
- Listen to me! Listen to me!
- Give me your sword!

727
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:10,600
Give me your sword or do you fortake given that honor.

728
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:13,300
There are bodies down there murdered by
Hassansin's on Nizam's order.

729
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:15,700
- He's the traitor!
- Hassasins no longer exist!

730
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:18,700
- You always thought you were so clever.
- This is no trick, Garsiv.

731
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:19,600
Sir!

732
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:23,800
All dead inside, sir, more in the village.

733
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:25,800
- There's one in there...
- Stay there!

734
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:34,300
Nizam wants me dead, wants me silenced.
A trial would be too public.

735
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:41,300
You know this?
He said this much, didn't he?

736
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,200
I know hate has been between
us, Garsiv, but still...

737
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:47,400
- We are brothers!
- Touching words,

738
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:48,800
with my sword at your throat.

739
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:51,000
You often question why
Father spends so much time in prayer.

740
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,700
Before he died he told me
that the bond between brothers

741
01:11:53,735 --> 01:11:55,300
is the sword that defends our empire.

742
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:57,900
He was pryaing that that sword
remains strong.

743
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:00,300
Why would I go to Abrat
to Father's funeral,

744
01:12:00,335 --> 01:12:01,600
when I knew it was so dangerous?

745
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:14,000
Nizam recommended your death.
Tus disagreed, ordered you brought back alive.

746
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:18,100
Nizam wants me dead
and he's hired the Hassansins to make

747
01:12:18,135 --> 01:12:19,200
sure that that does happen.

748
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:21,400
He is afraid of what I might say.

749
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:24,600
And who I might tell.

750
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:31,100
Tell me, brother.

751
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:36,000
Garsiv?

752
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:42,200
Wai...Garsiv?

753
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:44,000
Garsiv!

754
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:48,000
Hassansins!

755
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:08,100
Shut up, shut up!

756
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:21,200
Protect the Dagger!

757
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:39,500
Dastan!
Behind you!

758
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:50,800
Tamina!

759
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,400
Tamina! 
Forget them! Throw these!

760
01:13:55,900 --> 01:13:57,400
Find her!

761
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:07,100
Hey! Hey, over here!

762
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:09,400
Ha! You know what they say about men
with big swords?

763
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:25,400
Tamina!
Let me do it.

764
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:29,600
Only a Guardian
can return the Dagger.

765
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:32,000
This isn't something
you can do, Dastan.

766
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:35,900
I'm ready for this.

767
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:39,500
I'm not.

768
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:55,200
Tamina!

769
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:46,800
Enough!
Get out!

770
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:06,300
Garsive!

771
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,900
- Garsiv!
- Dastan, I'm sorry.

772
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:15,200
[gurgling] Save the empire.

773
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:19,100
Brother...

774
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:21,600
Brother...

775
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:28,300
- Where's the Dagger?
- It's gone.

776
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:32,800
Protect the Dagger,
no matter the consequences.

777
01:16:32,835 --> 01:16:34,200
That was my sacred honor.

778
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:36,800
And was my destiny.

779
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:47,800
We make our own destiny, Princess.
We'll get it back.

780
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:21,400
We're going to need another horse!

781
01:17:24,700 --> 01:17:27,300
- Where will you go?
- To Alomet.

782
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:33,300
Nizam will use the Dagger
to pierce the Sandglass

783
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:37,200
- He must be stopped.
- "He has to be stopped. He has to be stopped." [chuckle]

784
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:46,100
What? Oh, a knife-thrower with conscience?

785
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:07,700
Our friends in the palace say that

786
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:09,700
the Persians that have broken through to
the first levels of the tunnels.

787
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:12,100
They will reach the Sandglass within hours.

788
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Nizam's keeping the Dagger in the
High Temple,

789
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:18,800
guarded by some sort of demon
covered with spikes.

790
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:21,000
The Hassansin that killed my brother.

791
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:23,500
It's the only thing that stands
between us and the Dagger.

792
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:27,200
No man can stand within
20 yards of him and live.

793
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:30,400
Some don't need to get that close.

794
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:51,600
Spare some water, sire?

795
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:01,800
You sure about this?

796
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:05,800
- I owe the boy.
- But, you are an Um'Bakr...

797
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:10,300
Scourge of the Namidian plain.
Me? I'm a slightly dishonorable entrepreneur,

798
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:13,600
this nobility business is not the cloth
we're cut from.

799
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:17,300
- Hurry!
- My friend, has anyone ever told you

800
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:20,400
- that you talk too much?
- Uh huh.

801
01:19:26,700 --> 01:19:28,100
All right.
Come on!

802
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:11,400
Did I told you about the Um'Bakr?

803
01:22:13,900 --> 01:22:15,000
Yes, you have.

804
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:16,800
I hope your brother
listens to you, Persian.

805
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:28,900
He's here.
Seal every gate!

806
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:31,100
Find him!

807
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:04,700
- It's clear.
- Dastan!

808
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:10,700
- I don't think you should do this.
- Is it concern I hear?

809
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:13,900
- Caution.
- Sprinkled with concern.

810
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:18,600
- You flatter yourself, Prince.
- And you used to be a better liar, Princess.

811
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:21,500
Perhaps I'm out of practice...

812
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:25,200
This won't be the
last time we'll be together.

813
01:23:35,700 --> 01:23:38,300
- Where is the Dagger?
- You Persian bureaucrats...

814
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:40,400
- such soft hands.
- You!

815
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:52,000
- It's been found, my Lord.
- The Sandglass?

816
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:56,100
I don't have the Dagger.

817
01:23:58,100 --> 01:23:59,300
Leave me.

818
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:02,200
Hello, Tus.

819
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:03,800
Dastan!

820
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:07,200
- We need to talk.
- Talk.

821
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:09,900
- Alone.
- Wait outside the chamber.

822
01:24:10,900 --> 01:24:12,200
Now!

823
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:15,800
We are brothers, are we not?

824
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,800
The robe that killed Father
was poisoned by Nizam.

825
01:24:20,100 --> 01:24:24,200
- Nizam? You're mad!
- Who gave you the robe, Tus? Who gave you the robe!

826
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,500
You trust him?
As did I.

827
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:29,900
But Alomet wasn't supplying
our enemies with weapons.

828
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:33,300
- Nizam lied to us.
- Why would he do such a thing? What would he gain?

829
01:24:33,700 --> 01:24:37,700
Listen to me carefully.
Under the streets of the city lies

830
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:41,100
an ancient force, a container
holding the fabled Sands of Time.

831
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,900
Nizam wants to use it
to corrupt history.

832
01:24:43,935 --> 01:24:45,800
He wants to turn back
time and make himself King.

833
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:48,600
Sands of Time?

834
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:51,700
Heresy, Dastan!
Pagan madness!

835
01:24:52,100 --> 01:24:53,600
I've seen its power with my own eyes, Tus!

836
01:24:54,300 --> 01:24:55,700
Nizam discovered its resting place.

837
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,800
If we don't stop him
our world could end.

838
01:24:58,700 --> 01:25:02,000
If you want to kill me,
best you do it now.

839
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:09,200
This is no ordinary dagger.

840
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:13,900
Pres the jewel on its hilt
and you will see.

841
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:19,200
Should have had the strength 
to do this before we invaded the city...

842
01:25:19,700 --> 01:25:23,100
- What are you talking about?
- To act on what I know is right.

843
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:25,800
No matter the consequences.

844
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:38,700
- The soldiers remain out...
- Stay where are you!

845
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:47,400
He took his own life.

846
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:51,100
Then God have mercy on the
traitor, for he chose the path of the coward.

847
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:56,400
We know that both Dastan
was many things, but not a coward.

848
01:26:00,100 --> 01:26:01,400
"This is no ordinary dagger."

849
01:26:02,300 --> 01:26:05,100
"Press the jewel on its hilt
and you will see."

850
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:27,400
No matter the consequences.

851
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:29,000
Stop!

852
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:32,200
A moment ago you
died before my eyes.

853
01:26:34,900 --> 01:26:37,400
- You pressed it...
- How did you know I would?

854
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:40,500
Because we are brothers.

855
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:48,700
On the day we left for war,
our Father told me that a true king

856
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:53,100
considers the advice of counsel,
but always listens to his heart.

857
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:57,400
You shouldn't have had
to go so far for me to believe you.

858
01:26:58,300 --> 01:27:00,200
Your Majesty, the soldiers tell me that...

859
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,800
I see that Dastan has indeed returned.

860
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:09,700
Tus, remember what I told your!

861
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:16,600
No! A moment...

862
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:21,300
Poor Tus...so eager for the crown.

863
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:29,000
And you, Dastan, always charging in,
so desperate to prove you're

864
01:27:29,035 --> 01:27:33,500
more than something the King
scraped off the street.

865
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:37,200
What a glorious mess we are.

866
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:44,100
It seemed that the bond between brothers is no
longer the sword that defends our empire.

867
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:46,800
Yes!

868
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:10,100
He was one of us.

869
01:28:13,100 --> 01:28:14,700
He was a priest of the temple.

870
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:18,200
That's how Nizam discovered the existence
of the Sandglass!

871
01:28:18,900 --> 01:28:21,100
They corrupted the Guardians,
infected us.

872
01:28:21,700 --> 01:28:23,600
We are no longer pure.

873
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:26,500
We must hurry.

874
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:36,100
Pulley.

875
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:38,800
The pulley!
Now!

876
01:28:42,100 --> 01:28:46,000
Guardians built tunnels underneath the city
as secret access to Sandglass.

877
01:28:46,300 --> 01:28:48,200
If we move fast enough,
we can get there before Nizam.

878
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:15,900
That pulley descends to the Sandglass chamber.

879
01:29:17,700 --> 01:29:19,200
There is only one safe path!

880
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:21,900
Faster!

881
01:29:39,700 --> 01:29:41,200
Follow in my footsteps.

882
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:47,000
Nothing can touch the surface, 
other than where I step.

883
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:11,000
Run, Dastan!
Run!

884
01:30:20,100 --> 01:30:21,800
Dastan!

885
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:01,700
Nizam!

886
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:06,000
You killed your own family.

887
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:07,500
Sharaman was your brother!

888
01:33:08,100 --> 01:33:09,000
And my curse.

889
01:33:12,300 --> 01:33:13,500
I looked up to you.

890
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:17,800
Dastan!

891
01:33:17,900 --> 01:33:21,400
I never understood
why my brother brought trash into the palace.

892
01:33:22,100 --> 01:33:23,400
Enjoy the gutter, Dastan,

893
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:26,200
it's where you'll stay under my reign.

894
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Tamina!

895
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:40,700
Nizam!

896
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:42,100
Don't use the Dagger to alter your path!

897
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:44,700
- It will unleash...
- Unleash what?!

898
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,100
Dezlnui not nothing.

899
01:33:52,100 --> 01:33:53,300
Don't do this!

900
01:33:56,200 --> 01:33:57,000

901
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:09,300
Stop him,

902
01:34:09,500 --> 01:34:11,500
if the glass shatters
the world dies with it.

903
01:34:12,700 --> 01:34:14,700
It is not my destiny, it's yours.

904
01:34:15,300 --> 01:34:16,400
It always has been.

905
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:18,400
Let me go.

906
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:19,600
I won't.

907
01:34:20,300 --> 01:34:22,300
- Let me go.
- I'm not letting you go!

908
01:34:23,100 --> 01:34:24,600
I wish we could be together...

909
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,100
No!

910
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:31,500
No! No! No!

911
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:34,700
- Dastan!
- Noo!

912
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:37,100
Tamina!

913
01:34:37,300 --> 01:34:38,300
No!

914
01:35:07,300 --> 01:35:10,500
- Dastan!
- Tamina!

915
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:23,600
Prince Dastan!

916
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:25,600
Prince Dastan!

917
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:27,300
Bis?

918
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:28,800
- You're here.
- Of course I'm here.

919
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:31,800
Our army has surrounded Alomet's palace.

920
01:36:32,700 --> 01:36:33,700
The battle is over.

921
01:36:34,100 --> 01:36:34,900
Not yet.

922
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:44,500
Wait!

923
01:36:49,200 --> 01:36:50,300
Wait!

924
01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:55,600
Wait!

925
01:36:58,100 --> 01:36:59,700
Soldiers of Persia!

926
01:37:00,100 --> 01:37:02,700
We have been deceived
into attacking this Holy City.

927
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:07,600
- Alomet, has no weapons forges...
- Dastan!

928
01:37:08,700 --> 01:37:09,800
Have you gone mad?

929
01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:12,300
I cannot stay silent in the face of treachery.

930
01:37:12,900 --> 01:37:16,700
This war was set up by one,
trusted above above all else.

931
01:37:17,200 --> 01:37:18,300
Our Uncle Nizam.

932
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:20,100
Dastan has fought hard today,

933
01:37:20,300 --> 01:37:21,300
perhaps too hard.

934
01:37:21,400 --> 01:37:24,500
What he needs now is to get out
out of this burning sun to rest,

935
01:37:24,535 --> 01:37:25,800
gather his wits!

936
01:37:26,700 --> 01:37:28,700
Why haven't we found out forges?

937
01:37:29,400 --> 01:37:31,200
There are no weapons here, Uncle, and you know it.

938
01:37:31,700 --> 01:37:34,000
And this spy
which has supposedly intercepted weapons

939
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:38,300
was hired by you to persuade
all of us to invade Alomet!

940
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:39,900
What is this, Dastan?

941
01:37:40,300 --> 01:37:41,300
Victor's remorse?

942
01:37:41,400 --> 01:37:44,300
You yourself led the attack,
brought us this great triumph!

943
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,800
I should never have let the attack happen.

944
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:52,300
I knew in my heart that it was wrong.

945
01:37:55,900 --> 01:37:57,100
It will never be.

946
01:37:58,300 --> 01:37:59,400
You will never be King.

947
01:38:00,300 --> 01:38:01,500
You don't have the heart.

948
01:38:02,200 --> 01:38:04,100
You will die in the shadow

949
01:38:04,700 --> 01:38:06,000
of a great man.

950
01:38:10,700 --> 01:38:13,500
Get him down from there before he
makes an even bigger fool of himself!

951
01:38:13,700 --> 01:38:15,500
Tus...

952
01:38:15,700 --> 01:38:17,300
Before we left Nasaf, Father
told you this:

953
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:19,600
that a true King considers the advice
of counsel,

954
01:38:19,700 --> 01:38:22,300
but he always listens to his own heart.

955
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:24,900
Father and I were alone,

956
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:26,800
- how could you know that?
- He was right,

957
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:29,200
he knows us, he knows what we are capable of.

958
01:38:29,500 --> 01:38:30,700
Just listen to your heart.

959
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:32,500
He defies your order

960
01:38:32,700 --> 01:38:35,100
and leads the attack on his terms.
Tus.

961
01:38:37,100 --> 01:38:38,500
Take measure here.

962
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:52,600
The spy knows the truth!

963
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:55,000
Find the spy! Bring him to me!

964
01:38:55,400 --> 01:38:56,600
We'll wring it from him!

965
01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:34,900
You had what every man could ever dream of.

966
01:39:35,300 --> 01:39:38,300
Love, respect and family.

967
01:39:39,900 --> 01:39:41,400
But that wasn't enough
for you, was it?

968
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:18,600
Princess of Alomet...

969
01:40:20,700 --> 01:40:22,600
and I was misled to attack your city.

970
01:40:24,300 --> 01:40:25,300
Forgive me, Your Highness.

971
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:28,100
Let me try to make amends.

972
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:39,000
It would be to our mutual advantage

973
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:42,700
that our Nations to be united by a
bond stronger than friendship.

974
01:40:44,200 --> 01:40:45,200
Marriage.

975
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:51,500
Your marriage to one who is both so
conqueror, and savior, of your city.

976
01:40:56,600 --> 01:40:57,700
Dastan.

977
01:40:58,900 --> 01:41:00,200
Royal blood or not,

978
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:02,600
he is every bit a son to our father.

979
01:41:02,900 --> 01:41:04,800
Every bit a brother to Garsiv and me.

980
01:41:05,900 --> 01:41:07,500
A true Prince of Persia.

981
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:14,300
Go out there before I take your place.

982
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,100
Hello, Princess.

983
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:27,700
It, it is customary to accompany a proposal
with gifts

984
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:31,000
but, um, I was surprised and, alasm I'm unprepared.

985
01:41:32,400 --> 01:41:33,500
I have nothing for you.

986
01:41:35,100 --> 01:41:38,800
Save, that which is already yours.

987
01:41:49,700 --> 01:41:53,800
Walk with me, Prince Dastan.

988
01:42:00,700 --> 01:42:03,200
How can I trust
a man who breached the walls of my city?

989
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Well, I started to think I'm no longer
the same man who breached those walls.

990
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:10,100
That's a short time for
a man to change so much?

991
01:42:10,500 --> 01:42:11,800
Perhaps.

992
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,400
It sounds as if you have discovered something here.

993
01:42:18,900 --> 01:42:20,000
What would that be?

994
01:42:20,700 --> 01:42:22,400
A new spiritual awareness...

995
01:42:22,900 --> 01:42:25,200
- A destiny.
- Yes. Exactly.

996
01:42:26,200 --> 01:42:28,500
I believe we make own destiny, Princess.

997
01:42:29,400 --> 01:42:31,700
You have an unfortunate lack of curiosity.

998
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,600
No doubt one
of my many flaws.

999
01:42:33,635 --> 01:42:35,100
Please don't mock me, Prince.

1000
01:42:37,100 --> 01:42:39,600
Oh, I hardly think we know
each other well enough for that, Princess.

1001
01:42:40,900 --> 01:42:43,600
But I look forward to the day we do.

1002
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:50,000
