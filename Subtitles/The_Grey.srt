THE GREY
Subtitle: Szaki & LaDa

2
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,553
A job at the end of the world.

3
00:01:25,177 --> 00:01:28,600
A salary killer for a big
petroleum company.

4
00:01:31,137 --> 00:01:34,200
I don't know why I did half
the things I've done,

5
00:01:35,273 --> 00:01:37,200
but I know this is where I belong.

6
00:01:38,854 --> 00:01:41,000
Surrounded by my own.

7
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:43,780
Ex-cons,

8
00:01:43,828 --> 00:01:46,004
fugitives, drifters,

9
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,410
assholes.

10
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,330
Men unfit for mankind.

11
00:02:42,266 --> 00:02:45,194
There's not a second goes by
when I'm not thinking of you in some way.

12
00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:52,985
I want to see your face,

13
00:02:54,534 --> 00:02:56,690
feel your hands in mine,

14
00:02:58,262 --> 00:02:59,690
feel you against me.

15
00:03:06,101 --> 00:03:08,110
But I know that will never be.

16
00:03:09,446 --> 00:03:11,030
You left me,

17
00:03:13,347 --> 00:03:15,270
and I can't get you back.

18
00:03:18,789 --> 00:03:21,159
I move like I imagine the damned do,

19
00:03:22,848 --> 00:03:24,233
cursed.

20
00:03:29,004 --> 00:03:31,130
And I feel like it's only a matter of time.

21
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:47,130
I don't know why I'm writing this,

22
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,650
I don't know what can come of it.

23
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:02,050
I know I can't get you back.

24
00:04:42,797 --> 00:04:45,470
I don't know why this has
happened to us.

25
00:04:47,392 --> 00:04:49,270
I feel like it's me,

26
00:04:50,354 --> 00:04:51,810
bad luck...

27
00:04:52,426 --> 00:04:53,870
poison.

28
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:04,230
And I've stopped doing this
world any real good.

29
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,770
Once more into the fray.

30
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:04,210
Into the last good fight
I'll ever know.

31
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,050
Live...

32
00:06:36,952 --> 00:06:39,570
and die on this day.

33
00:06:49,757 --> 00:06:50,857
Live...

34
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,170
and die...

35
00:06:55,385 --> 00:06:56,970
on this day.

36
00:07:07,304 --> 00:07:09,524
Let’s go. Idents
and boarding passes please.

37
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:13,273
Please have them out
there’s a storm coming in

38
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:15,310
We gotta get this plane
off the tarmac.

39
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:19,170
Guys are fucking this up, let’s go.

40
00:07:53,277 --> 00:07:54,910
Shit, sorry bro.

41
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:00,250
Sorry man, sorry.

42
00:08:15,136 --> 00:08:18,010
It is as cold as this mother-
fucker has ever been, huh?

43
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:23,070
I ain't shitting either, man. I stripped down for
the shower and icicles are formed on my nuts.

44
00:08:24,382 --> 00:08:26,630
I didn't even think that shit was possible.

45
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:29,190
- You got a girl back in Anchorage?
- No.

46
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:35,832
Oh, well. I got me a few.
Went out to get the scrape.

47
00:08:36,202 --> 00:08:37,890
At least that’s what she told me.

48
00:08:38,205 --> 00:08:40,280
She’s been hitting me up
for the money ever since.

49
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:43,600
I’m like: ”Bitch, we both fucked”

50
00:08:43,671 --> 00:08:45,400
„I'll split it with you, whatever.„

51
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,620
I'am Flannery, by the way...
Todd.

52
00:08:47,762 --> 00:08:50,540
- You're Aman, right?
- Ottway.

53
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,860
Oh, opps! Sorry bro. Ottway, yeah.

54
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:56,380
So, you blast critters for a living, huh?
You do some of that snipe issue.

55
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,820
What's the biggest piece of game
you've taken down? Like a kodiak?

56
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,780
You know, I saw that documentary
that asshole did. You know, the fag who loves bears...

57
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,420
Listen. Listen pal. I don't wanna talk.

58
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,660
I need some quiet. So I'm just
gonna put head back, okay?

59
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,500
Yeah, that's cool. That's cool.

60
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,060
- Sir, sir, I need you sit down, please.
- Yeah, I am sitting.

61
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:47,470
- You like that chick?
- No, I don’t. - Yeah, you do.

62
00:09:49,007 --> 00:09:52,827
Just really never you can seriously say,
not only does it make you impotent

63
00:09:53,053 --> 00:09:56,053
but it poisons you,
and it causes some skin rashes.

64
00:09:57,404 --> 00:09:58,474
- No, it’s the opposite.
- Whatever.

65
00:09:59,505 --> 00:10:00,475
Dude.

66
00:10:00,735 --> 00:10:02,055
- Was it?
- Plus it tastes like shit.

67
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:04,342
Did you ever taste that?

68
00:10:04,377 --> 00:10:05,697
You ever seen one?

69
00:10:07,698 --> 00:10:13,074
- What's the other thing?
- …Not, not into it, not into it. Incontinent.

70
00:10:17,405 --> 00:10:19,175
That reminds me of my childhood.

71
00:10:21,678 --> 00:10:23,398
That was a true story,
a true story...

72
00:10:35,463 --> 00:10:36,683
Fuck me...

73
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,020
- What was that?
- Shit...

74
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,120
Hey guys, do yourself a favor.

75
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,060
Don't do that head between your knees
crash position shit, if this fuck goes down.

76
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,220
Shut the fuck up!

77
00:10:51,552 --> 00:10:52,672
Shut up!

78
00:10:52,713 --> 00:10:54,333
- Shut the fuck up!
- Suck my dick!

79
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,260
Why would you even say that?

80
00:10:56,361 --> 00:10:58,260
I'm just saying, I've seen
on Discovery channel,

81
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,800
this plane crashed, these people’s spines
went through the top of their skulls

82
00:11:01,811 --> 00:11:03,681
cause they were all bent over
like fucking retards.

83
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,950
- Flannery, I’m gonna knock you the fuck out. Shut up!
- Who is friends with this guy?

84
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,520
- I was just saying.
- Shut the fuck up!

85
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,821
Whoever is closest should just fucking hit him.

86
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,340
Fucking guy, man! is he planning on flying out
of this shit anytime, or what?

87
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,445
Whooa you boys are sensitive.

88
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:43,110
Hey. There's ice on the
inside of the window.

89
00:12:45,311 --> 00:12:46,851
What's going on?

90
00:12:52,422 --> 00:12:54,022
- What happened?
- ...remain calm.

91
00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:10,949
Tell the pilot to get on

92
00:13:11,237 --> 00:13:12,857
and tell us what’s going on here.

93
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,270
Sir, you have to sit back
down to the seat.

94
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:42,489
Help! Help me out!

95
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:54,530
Help! Help!

96
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,220
Somebody help me!

97
00:15:52,271 --> 00:15:54,191
Help me!

98
00:15:56,029 --> 00:15:57,549
Help me, somebody!

99
00:15:58,285 --> 00:16:00,640
Help! Somebody help me!

100
00:16:01,702 --> 00:16:02,702
I got you!

101
00:16:03,377 --> 00:16:04,377
I got you!

102
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,280
- I got you!
- Oh, we fucking went down!

103
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,280
Oh my God! Oh my God!
That guy's cut in half!

104
00:16:12,281 --> 00:16:14,081
Don't look! Don't look at it!
Don't look!

105
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,000
Look at me!
Look at me!

106
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,200
My hand's fucked, my legs fucked.
Aahh! Fuck!

107
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,580
- It’s good…It's good that it hurts.
- Is it good? - Yeah.

108
00:16:23,624 --> 00:16:25,124
Oh, then I’m fucking fabulous.

109
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:28,060
- Are you bleeding anywhere else?
- I don't know, man, I can't tell.

110
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,880
- Listen, I'll be right back.
- Don't go, don't leave me!

111
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,080
- Where are you going? - Fuck
- Stay calm. It’s okay.

112
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,020
Oh, shit!

113
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,620
It's got to be okay.
There's some Vicodin in my bag.

114
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,220
- Hernandez, are you okay?
- I just gotta make a call to Vanessa.

115
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,140
I gotta make a quick call to
Vanessa. Just one call.

116
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,380
You're in shock, Hernandez.
But I need you to start over.

117
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,800
- What happened?
- The plane went down, man. We crashed.

118
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:17,000
Oh, no! No! No! That's bullshit!
That's fucking bullshit! I'm just asleep!
- We crashed.

119
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,920
I'm just sleeping! There's no way
that could have happened!

120
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,400
- What about the pilots?
- Pilots? What are you talking about?

121
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,200
The plane's gone, man!
It's in pieces. Look.

122
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:29,691
Oh, fuck!

123
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,320
Oh, my God!

124
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,240
Oh, my God!

125
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,720
This is so fucked up!
I can't fucking believe it.

126
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,210
- Are there lots of people dead?
- Yes.

127
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,520
But I need you to help me
find the one's that aren't.

128
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,480
- Can you walk?
- Yeah.

129
00:18:01,234 --> 00:18:02,234
Oh, fuck!

130
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,610
I got you, allright, I got you.

131
00:18:27,611 --> 00:18:29,011
- Too much blood!
- Fuck!

132
00:18:29,479 --> 00:18:30,679
Fucking phone doesn't work!

133
00:18:34,946 --> 00:18:35,966
I got this. I’m help.

134
00:18:36,646 --> 00:18:38,146
You’re losing too much blood.

135
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,165
Fucking lose all this blood.

136
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,040
- Help him!
- Ottway, help him.

137
00:18:45,901 --> 00:18:47,131
Wait!

138
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,480
It's can't be all coming outside.

139
00:18:49,705 --> 00:18:53,095
Too much blood. This is
way too much blood. Oh! Fuck!

140
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,560
Help me. Help me, okay?
Something's wrong.

141
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:03,520
Something's really, really wrong here. Okay?
I don't feel right. I just... I just don't.

142
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,320
Help me. Okay? This doesn't...

143
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,460
- Look. - Something's wrong with me,
I know. Okay?

144
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,061
Aahh! I don't feel right.
Something feels wrong.

145
00:19:14,147 --> 00:19:15,587
Listen. Listen.

146
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,080
You're gonna die,
that's what's happening.

147
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,330
What?

148
00:19:27,404 --> 00:19:28,724
It's okay.

149
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,960
No. No. No. No.
Wait. Wait. Wait.

150
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,320
- Hold on.
- It's okay.

151
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,680
- Hold on, hold on, wait, wait, wait...
- Look at me. Sshh!

152
00:19:39,691 --> 00:19:41,291
Hold on! Hold on!
Hold on! No!

153
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,800
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.

154
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,260
Look at me. Look at me.

155
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,900
Keep looking at me.

156
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:52,260
It's all right. It's alright.
Look. Look at me. Keep looking at me.

157
00:19:52,301 --> 00:19:53,940
It's all right.

158
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,860
It'll slide over you.

159
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:00,820
It'll start to feel warm.
Nice and warm.

160
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,540
It'll move over you.
It's all right.

161
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,820
Let your thoughts go.

162
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,880
Hold the good things.

163
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,280
Hold the good things, yeah?

164
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,520
Who do you love?

165
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,780
Who do you love, Lew?

166
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,260
My girl, Rosie.

167
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,540
Is she your daughter?

168
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,560
Yes.

169
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,160
Let her take you then.

170
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,560
Let her take you.

171
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,600
It's okay. It's okay.

172
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:37,760
Did he just fucking die?

173
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,780
He's just fucking died, didn't he?

174
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:44,700
Oh, God!

175
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,920
- Did you...?
- Yeah.

176
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,870
- Did you feel him?
- Yeah.

177
00:21:50,567 --> 00:21:52,087
I felt him go.

178
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,859
Is this everyone?

179
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,620
Is this everyone who is still alive?

180
00:22:13,641 --> 00:22:16,321
- Yeah. - Yeah.
- Yeah, I’m going cold.

181
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:18,340
One... two... three.

182
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:23,380
Seven, seven of us.
That we know of. Yeah.

183
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,020
Okay. Okay.

184
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,820
We fuck it.

185
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:32,420
You had to open your fat fucking mouth.
You had to keep talking. You had to put on us?

186
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,260
I didn't do shit.
Did I fucking crash us?

187
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,020
We need a fire.

188
00:22:38,121 --> 00:22:39,721
Did I…I… I didn’t do shit.

189
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:44,540
We should gather up anything that'll burn.
Seats, luggage, any wood we can find.

190
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:48,300
- What are you doing?
- I said we need a fire.

191
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:51,260
It's about ten below and dropping.

192
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,340
So we don't die,

193
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:02,020
we build up a fire,
then we find food,

194
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:06,080
and at daybreak we figure out what
way is south and we start walking.

195
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:09,900
- Nobody is going to find us, not here.
- Somebody will find us.

196
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,700
- I mean, somebody will be fucking searching.
- They gotta know that plane went off the radar.

197
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,100
- Right!
- If they send fifty planes,

198
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,780
maybe they'll find us.
But they won't send fifty planes,

199
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,540
because it won't matter, because...

200
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:22,060
we won't have time to wait for the one
or two that they will send.

201
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,460
Wilburt doesn't give a fuck.
Wilburt doesn't give a fuck.
Nobody gives a shit about us.

202
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,705
You know how much payroll
they just pocketed in this crash?

203
00:23:33,105 --> 00:23:35,860
If we don't move and work now,
we're all fucked.

204
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:39,900
Unless you wanna freeze to death,
cause that's the one thing that will come for you.

205
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:54,000
Hey asshole! I suggest
you get away from here!

206
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:01,860
A lot of wood...
It’s something to wear.

207
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,540
Don't.

208
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,940
Hey, careful with that,
she would kill us.

209
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,740
Fuck.

210
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:11,941
Oh, no.

211
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,800
- We gotta do something with the bodies.
- Fuck the bodies!

212
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,360
Fuck the bodies! Grab what burns,
or you're gonna be a body!

213
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,360
- Relax, Rambo. Relax.
- You fucking relax.

214
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,760
Telling me to relax.

215
00:24:27,045 --> 00:24:29,640
- They're everywhere.
- I got a book!

216
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:33,400
It's called we're all fucked!
It's a best seller.

217
00:24:40,001 --> 00:24:42,851
Here.
Oh, fuck!

218
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,000
- Hey man take it easy with that.
- Why?

219
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,520
Because I don't want to fuckin catch fire.

220
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,230
Hello?

221
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,520
I see you! I'm coming!

222
00:25:16,921 --> 00:25:18,121
Jesus Christ!

223
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,760
Get out you motherfucker!

224
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:50,590
Who are they?

225
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:53,360
- You okay?
- You see him?

226
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,740
You okay?

227
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:06,520
- Come on man, we gotta get the fuck out of here.
- Don't stand, don't stand around.

228
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,860
What the hell was that?

229
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,260
- What's that?
- What the hell was that?

230
00:26:14,285 --> 00:26:15,880
- I didn’t fucking see that.
- Coyotes? Huh?

231
00:26:16,744 --> 00:26:18,964
- What's these shit?
- Fucking big.

232
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,760
They are big.

233
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:10,290
Maybe I'll turn into a wolfman now, huh?

234
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:12,410
Wait...

235
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:15,290
that shit's not real... right?
You mean you can't.

236
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:17,790
Ass-wipe, what do you think? Really?

237
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,450
I don't know, man.
I mean like Rabies, or whatever.

238
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:22,770
I didn't think the motherfucker
was gonna grow paws and teeth and shit.

239
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,460
Asshole.

240
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,370
You think there's more of them?

241
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,770
- Wolves?
- Maybe.

242
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:31,150
Yeah, most likely.

243
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:33,410
But we shouldn't be worried
about them right now,

244
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:36,090
we should be worrying about finding food.

245
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:40,330
- They're probably only passing through.
- Wait a minute.

246
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,890
Passing through as opposed to what?

247
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:45,850
Living here, hunting here.

248
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:49,890
Wolves have a territorial range of
over three hundred miles

249
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,000
and a killer range of thirty.

250
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:57,490
If we're close to their den,

251
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:59,570
and if we're within that radius,

252
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,810
then they'll come after us.

253
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,590
Well, how can we tell
if we're close?

254
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,410
We can't.

255
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,870
They might have just been feeding,

256
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:15,850
here's bodies everywhere.
I threatened them, they attacked.

257
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:17,530
What about the radius?

258
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:20,660
I mean, if we're in that, what,
they're gonna fight us?

259
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:24,890
- I thought wolves were scared of people.
- Not if we're near their den.

260
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:27,410
They're not scared of anything then.

261
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:32,290
What kind of wolves are they? I mean,
what do they call the ones that just eat plants and shit?

262
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:35,520
- Huh! They don't call them wolves.
- Herbivores, that's what you mean.

263
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,410
That's wishful thinking.

264
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:41,290
When did you come king shit
fucking animal expert all of a sudden?

265
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,210
They paid me to kill those things,

266
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,350
to keep them from killing you.

267
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:51,450
So it makes sense for me to know they're man eaters
and they don't give a shit about berries and shrubs.

268
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,850
There's blood in the air,

269
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:55,730
and there's death.

270
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,810
They know we're wounded,

271
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,890
they can smell it.

272
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,290
Hopefully they won't fuck with us.

273
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:13,730
We need to move these bodies out of here.

274
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,290
And then we've gotta find food.

275
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:28,550
Ah, check this fucking thing out.

276
00:29:30,142 --> 00:29:31,662
Jesus, Diaz. Don't do that.

277
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:37,590
No, man. I saw one of these once.
It's got a beacon, you know? GPS.

278
00:29:39,001 --> 00:29:40,201
Yeah.

279
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:44,490
Holy shit!

280
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:49,450
Holy shit, man! It works.
It's beeping!

281
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:52,890
This things can reach out like
forty thousand feet.

282
00:29:53,181 --> 00:29:54,981
Yes, I think that's great
if that gives you hope.

283
00:29:55,162 --> 00:29:58,882
- It's fucking heart warming.
- Very funny, bro.

284
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:04,490
Wow. That nice, my friend.
It's calfskin. It's very nice, not cheap.

285
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:09,770
And since you cocksuckers
didn't give us a holiday bonus,

286
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:12,690
- I'm gonna accept this on behalf of my homies.
- Put that back.

287
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:16,490
Put it back!

288
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:19,330
We're not looting dead bodies for swag.

289
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:22,530
You got lucky today, Ottway.
You should be lying there with them. Don't push it!

290
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:25,410
- I'm not gonna say it again!
- I'm a fucking take a big step back!

291
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:28,530
I'm gonna start beating the shit
out of you in the next five seconds,

292
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:31,970
and you're gonna swallow a lot of blood
for a fucking billfold!

293
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:47,850
I can't fucking stand guys like that.

294
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:50,210
These turn that into charcoal.

295
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:54,290
I'd say that we have about enough booze
for you guys to get drunk two more times.

296
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:56,870
- Fucking weird.
- After that then we’ll all be sober.

297
00:30:56,881 --> 00:30:58,271
Jack makes me fight.

298
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:01,210
- Ladies, ladies...
- You like the white or brown?

299
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:04,370
How about some brown stuff?
No Tequila, sorry about that.

300
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:07,490
- It's all good. Thanks, papa.
- Where the fuck did you get that?

301
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:10,490
From that thing...
that server thing with wheels on it.

302
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:14,830
There's bunch of dead bodies all over, man.
You wanna make sure you know where that meat came from.

303
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:18,930
You know, it's like that movie where they start
taking chunks of frozen ass out of that guy.

304
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:21,930
- The plane crash, with that dude from training day? - Right.

305
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:24,050
It might be fucking funny as fuck.

306
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:26,490
How would you like
a dead ass on a stick?

307
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:30,250
And you thought like a severed dick
was hot dog, right? That's too fucking funny.

308
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:33,290
I wish some of the other dudes
would have lived.

309
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:41,970
Did you hear that?

310
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:44,030
Get up, get up!

311
00:31:45,851 --> 00:31:47,331
Let's move. Go, go!

312
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:49,250
What the fuck is that?

313
00:31:49,851 --> 00:31:50,951
What is it?

314
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:02,570
Everybody be cool.
Don't move.

315
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:12,310
- Jesus Christ!
- Stare right back them.

316
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:19,510
Wait. Wait. Wait.
Why are they coming closer?

317
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:23,570
- Ah, fuck this shit! I'm getting back in the plane.
- Hendrick, God damn it! Don't move.

318
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:27,170
Look at the size of that fucking thing.

319
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:47,810
We'll take two hour shifts.

320
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:49,770
I'll start. You guys get some sleep.

321
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:53,210
Yeah. Like that shit's gonna happen.

322
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:44,010
Don't be afraid.

323
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:57,411
Hey!

324
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:02,380
Don’t drift out from us, Burke.

325
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:05,190
I’ll be allright

326
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,450
I'm not gonna sleep.

327
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:18,790
Motherfucker.

328
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:26,490
Where is my goddamn kid
when I need him?

329
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:23,290
Jesus Christ!

330
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:33,290
Oh, Jesus Christ.

331
00:36:36,405 --> 00:36:37,770
No, no, no, no!

332
00:36:38,267 --> 00:36:39,287
Fuck!

333
00:36:39,754 --> 00:36:40,754
Man it's... fuck!

334
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:43,099
Oh, shit!

335
00:36:49,771 --> 00:36:50,991
They ate him.

336
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:55,090
Jesus Christ!
They ate him.

337
00:36:55,091 --> 00:36:56,791
Fuck, fuck!

338
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:01,730
They weren't eating him.

339
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:05,170
They were killing him.

340
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:09,290
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

341
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:13,210
How did we not hear them?
How many did it take to do that?

342
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,930
We could dig in, make some...

343
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:20,050
kind of a stand,
not much cover though.

344
00:37:20,365 --> 00:37:22,070
Woh! Woh! What do you mean,
a stand?

345
00:37:22,545 --> 00:37:25,370
Like fight those motherfucking giant things?
Are you out of your mind?

346
00:37:25,435 --> 00:37:28,090
They'll get bold, start to come in for us.

347
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:29,530
Why would they?

348
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:32,050
- I mean, we're not harming them. It's not for food!
- We're a threat.

349
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:34,090
We don't belong here, that's it.

350
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:40,090
There's trees out there,

351
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:43,550
if we can get to that tree line,
they might back off.

352
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:45,970
If they see that we're leaving,
they might.

353
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:48,650
Fuck that! What they might do?
Bullshit!

354
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:51,890
What they might do?!
Are you fucking kidding me?

355
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,830
Hey, they pissed all over this place.
They mean to tag it.

356
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:57,770
We can't wait them out, we'll starve.

357
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:02,590
There's a lot of bad space between us
and that forest, but if we get there, then...

358
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:07,690
we could better defend ourselves.
Less exposed, I don't know.

359
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:09,330
Yeah. You don't know.

360
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:12,610
And nobody nominated you shit,
by the way.

361
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:16,290
It's getting to that point
in the evening, girls.

362
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:18,490
- Fucking heach is on.
- What the fuck you talking about?

363
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:21,330
Diaz, come on, man. You wouldn't last
five fucking minutes out here.

364
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:24,450
I survived that.
This ain't shit.

365
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:27,490
- I find a way through, with or without.
- Fuck it.

366
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:30,330
I'm gonna take whatever I can carry
and head into those trees.

367
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:33,770
You guys wanna join me,
then strip everything.

368
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,410
Fucking losers.

369
00:39:57,139 --> 00:39:58,159
Hey!

370
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:02,290
We should collect all the wallets

371
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:04,850
for the families.

372
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:12,770
Wallets? Did I hear wallets?
Cause I carried a wallet.

373
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:19,570
Hendrick, do you mind carrying them?

374
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:21,690
Yeah, let's waste a little more time.

375
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:24,650
Even though the weather's about
to kick our ass.

376
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:27,725
You grab them wallets.

377
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:30,190
Fucking idiots!

378
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:34,090
To Hernandez.

379
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:39,330
Grab as many as you can.

380
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:45,050
Grab, as many as you can.
Waste as much fuckin' time as you can.

381
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:47,690
I'm gonna stay here
with my friend, Jack Daniels,

382
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:50,090
and waste some time of my own.

383
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:57,370
- Why don't you just fucking help us, man? Huh?
- Oh, I'm helping you. I'm helping you. I'm warming up, man!

384
00:40:57,490 --> 00:40:59,530
You guys find any rubbish, save 'em.

385
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:03,730
- I don't know how long I'm gonna be out here with you fairies.
- Why don't you shut the fuck up?!

386
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,885
The key to survival, fellas.

387
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:14,210
Grab their wallets...
grab their wallets.

388
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:54,090
Hendrick.

389
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:16,650
Wait!

390
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:26,560
I feel like we should say something.
I mean, all these bodies, all these...

391
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:31,560
all these people that died,
it doesn't seem right to just walk away.

392
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:45,410
I don't know any official prayers,
so uh... I guess, uh...

393
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:50,610
God bless these men.

394
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:53,290
They were...

395
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:57,330
some of them, our friends.

396
00:42:58,290 --> 00:43:00,690
and uh... we could be
lying here with them.

397
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:09,450
So, thank you for sparing us
and helping us.

398
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:15,730
Oh, and... keep that up, if you can.

399
00:44:44,831 --> 00:44:45,931
Fuck!

400
00:44:47,532 --> 00:44:48,732
Fuck!

401
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:56,370
Don't worry about me,
motherfuckers!

402
00:44:56,490 --> 00:45:00,490
If any of you wanna run off into the trees,
that's cool too.

403
00:45:02,091 --> 00:45:04,610
No! No! No! Ottway!

404
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:07,290
Help me!

405
00:45:07,545 --> 00:45:08,930
Help me!

406
00:45:09,161 --> 00:45:10,361
Help...

407
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:12,090
Oh, fuck!

408
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:13,890
Flannery!

409
00:45:14,198 --> 00:45:15,318
Get off him!

410
00:45:15,978 --> 00:45:17,098
Flannery!

411
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:21,350
Flannery!

412
00:45:25,211 --> 00:45:26,731
Jesus!
Flannery!

413
00:45:27,732 --> 00:45:28,532
Flannery!

414
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:07,490
No.

415
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:47,790
Do you wanna say anything?

416
00:46:55,210 --> 00:46:58,290
Come on. Let's keep moving.
There's nothing else we can do for him.

417
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:15,010
Those trees aren't getting
any fucking closer.

418
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:17,450
We're gonna be out here
in the dark with those things.

419
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:21,090
We have no idea if we're going
towards them or away from it, do we?

420
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:24,770
- Why didn't we just stay with the plane?
- Oh, come on.

421
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:28,370
- They would have surrounded us. - How the fuck
do we know if they're not doing that right now?!

422
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,700
Fucking genius.

423
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:35,410
- We're still better off in the trees.
- Yeah, we're better off.

424
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,430
- You tell that kid.
- Fuck.

425
00:47:58,610 --> 00:48:00,290
What is that?

426
00:48:04,490 --> 00:48:06,490
- Run!
- Go, go into the trees!

427
00:48:06,757 --> 00:48:08,257
All this way!

428
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:13,230
Go, go, go!

429
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:15,690
- They are right on us.
- Don't stop running!

430
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:18,970
Wait, wait.

431
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:24,810
Don't look back!

432
00:48:24,911 --> 00:48:25,911
Run!

433
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:27,970
They're flanking us!

434
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:30,570
Don't stop!

435
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:42,890
- Sam? Sam?
- They're all around us!

436
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:47,010
Need a fire to keep them off us.
Hurry!

437
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:50,770
Wood is wet.

438
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:52,730
Lets burn it, hurry!

439
00:48:56,036 --> 00:48:57,890
Get that fucking thing lit.

440
00:49:02,090 --> 00:49:03,810
- Come on!
- Come on, baby, come on!

441
00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:05,610
Tell me that thing’s unbroke.

442
00:49:06,890 --> 00:49:09,490
Just can't get it going that way.

443
00:49:09,591 --> 00:49:10,791
Hurry!

444
00:49:11,930 --> 00:49:14,130
OK, that's it. That's it.

445
00:49:16,831 --> 00:49:18,115
It's going out...
Fuck!

446
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:27,730
- That's it. Come on.
- That’s fine.

447
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:48,960
It worked.

448
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,920
We start perimeter fires.

449
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,280
Let’s see these bastards before hey come…

450
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,120
What the fuck was that?

451
00:50:21,581 --> 00:50:22,581
The alpha.

452
00:50:22,730 --> 00:50:24,180
They went at him,

453
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:27,500
he put it down.

454
00:50:28,511 --> 00:50:30,940
Whatever... whatever that challenge was,

455
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:32,700
the alpha put it down.

456
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:37,060
How are we gonna deal with this?

457
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:38,700
We kill them.

458
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:41,820
One at a time.

459
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:43,780
Tip the numbers.

460
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:46,100
That's what they're doing to us.

461
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:05,980
- What the hell are these for?
- I'll explain.

462
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:09,500
Fix them with electrical tape.
Talget, you got some, yeah?

463
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:10,980
In here somewhere.

464
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:12,780
Shot gun shell...

465
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:15,780
spear tip.

466
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:20,060
The tip has to drive into the primer
and set off the shell.

467
00:51:20,671 --> 00:51:21,980
Secure them with these sticks

468
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:24,860
with the tape, simple.

469
00:51:26,151 --> 00:51:28,140
Jab with them when
the wolf gets close.

470
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:29,980
Hit 'em hard,

471
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:31,780
gotta get real close.

472
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:35,740
It'll work,

473
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:37,820
it's like a bang stick.

474
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:41,140
A round discharges,
you pull it loose,

475
00:51:42,201 --> 00:51:44,860
you still got something sharp
to create distance.

476
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:49,460
Unless you want to fist fight 'em.
There you go.

477
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:54,860
One shot a piece, guys.
Make 'em count. Burke.

478
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:01,780
Blacken the tips with in the fire, guys.
Makes them harder, stronger.

479
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:07,740
Really, boys?
This is what's come down too, huh?

480
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:10,820
This MacGyver bullshit?

481
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:15,020
Okay.

482
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:17,060
Good.

483
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:22,860
I appreciate a good laugh
as much as the next guy.

484
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:37,120
These things, they see well at night?

485
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,480
Jesus, can we talk
about something else, please?

486
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:44,160
Talget, you're carrying all that booze.
Let's break it out.

487
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:48,200
- I recommend rationing what we have.
- I recommend you kissin' my ass.

488
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:50,320
What, are you the booze police now?

489
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:54,440
You fucking guys, with your rules
and orders and bullshit.

490
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:56,560
Where are we?

491
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,360
Look around.

492
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,760
This is Fuck City,

493
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,780
population five and dwindling.

494
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:11,680
Two days, three maybe,
if we really pull our shit together.

495
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,280
Who's in charge of that right now?
This fucking guy?

496
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,600
The great white hunter,

497
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,560
with his jerry rigged
fucking wolf sticks.

498
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,720
Why are you constantly breaking balls
and bitching about everything?

499
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:32,680
Cause I wanna live, motherfucker.

500
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:33,960
Do you understand that?

501
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:37,080
I don't want some Timberwolf
shittin' me out on this mountain.

502
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:39,800
You're scared.

503
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:43,720
- What?
- You don't need all that nonsense,

504
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,480
all that chest puff bullshit.

505
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,200
What's wrong with being scared?

506
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,680
I'm not scared.

507
00:53:51,131 --> 00:53:52,760
- You're not?
- No.

508
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,840
- I'm terrified.
- I can tell.

509
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:00,600
And not an ounce of shame in saying it.
I'm scared shitless.

510
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,320
That's because you're a punk.

511
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:07,880
I don't walk through this world
with fear in my heart.

512
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:09,800
You pick that up in the pen?

513
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,720
Somebody scribble that
in the day room wall?

514
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,400
You better take it easy,
motherfucker.

515
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,880
Talking tough means jackshit now.

516
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,800
You're not scared?

517
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,200
You're a fool.
Worse, you're a fucking liar.

518
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,880
I should have checked
your chin in the fuckin' plane.

519
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:30,240
Get up! Come on!
Get up, you big Irish fuck.

520
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,300
- You wanna knuckle up? Come on! Come on,
we don't have - Put that fucking knife down.

521
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:34,880
- Get the fuck off me!
- Put that knife away!

522
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:37,160
Shut up! Shut up.
You chicken shits make me sick.

523
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:39,160
Son of a bitch!

524
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,680
You got that kid, Flannery killed
and you're not gonna get me killed.

525
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,160
Put your fucking hands up. Let me show you
how this is done. Put your fucking hands up!

526
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:52,240
- Ah! You motherfucker!
- Cut this shit out!

527
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:53,960
Do you hear me?

528
00:55:21,066 --> 00:55:22,800
Get up, get up, get up.

529
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:12,880
What the fuck?

530
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:15,120
What did it want?

531
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,400
You.

532
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:40,600
Diaz, please don't do that shit
to me again.

533
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:43,120
Allright?

534
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,660
No mas!

535
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,200
That was bullshit,

536
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,600
I'm sorry.

537
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:18,601
I'm sorry.

538
00:57:43,351 --> 00:57:47,100
- Fuck you! Fuck!
- ...fuck?

539
00:57:49,101 --> 00:57:50,101
Fuck!

540
00:57:51,405 --> 00:57:52,625
Fuck!

541
00:57:54,421 --> 00:57:56,880
Diaz, I think you got him. Yeah!

542
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:04,000
Oh! You Fuck!

543
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:06,680
I think I lost a nail. Ah!

544
00:58:11,831 --> 00:58:14,400
Is that the big one?
That big fucker?

545
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:18,200
It's not the alpha,
It's an omega.

546
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:23,040
An outcast. They sent it in
to test you, Diaz.

547
00:58:23,571 --> 00:58:27,200
That freak bitch!
Die, fucking bitch!

548
00:58:27,971 --> 00:58:29,640
You fucking dog.

549
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:51,910
Let's get a large branch

550
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:55,360
sharpen the end of it,
shove it up in this thing's ass.

551
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,350
We're gonna cook that son of bitch.

552
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:02,920
And then we're gonna eat it.

553
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:12,259
Hey, wolf? Not so tough now, huh wolf?

554
00:59:14,222 --> 00:59:17,660
- You want? Come on!
- No! - I've got it. - I've got it.

555
00:59:18,225 --> 00:59:19,699
Is this the white meat
or dark meat?

556
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:22,427
- Dark...
- As black as bug.

557
00:59:22,986 --> 00:59:23,707
Yeah?

558
00:59:23,708 --> 00:59:28,067
And I know it tastes like shit, but guys,
it might be the last meat we'll get for a while.

559
00:59:28,068 --> 00:59:29,375
It's grisly too.

560
00:59:30,309 --> 00:59:32,345
- It tastes like shit, I know,
but eat it, guys. - Yeah.

561
00:59:32,346 --> 00:59:34,381
It tastes like dog shit.

562
00:59:35,032 --> 00:59:37,994
Then I'm much more
of a cat person really.

563
00:59:45,637 --> 00:59:49,258
- Burke? - Yeah.
- Are you all right?

564
00:59:49,679 --> 00:59:51,120
My head's a little off. I'm...

565
00:59:51,121 --> 00:59:54,056
- Sit down, sit down.
- I feel a little dizzy.

566
01:00:09,206 --> 01:00:12,448
- You think they're watching us?
- Oh, yeah. They're watching us.

567
01:00:13,249 --> 01:00:17,150
You'll fuck with us,
we'll fuck with you.

568
01:00:18,251 --> 01:00:19,251
You hear that?

569
01:00:21,893 --> 01:00:24,014
You're not the animals!

570
01:00:24,773 --> 01:00:26,530
We're the animals!

571
01:00:33,257 --> 01:00:36,931
Come here you fucker!
Come here you puppy.

572
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:44,942
- Oh, yeah ...
- You're a twisted fuck.

573
01:00:44,943 --> 01:00:47,062
You wrong for that,
that is wrong!

574
01:00:47,063 --> 01:00:50,865
I'm not crazy.
I'm not fucking crazy. You fuck!

575
01:00:52,805 --> 01:00:54,186
That's fucked up.

576
01:00:55,187 --> 01:00:56,494
I mean, that's fucked up.

577
01:00:57,108 --> 01:00:59,732
You tried to steal my fucking life?

578
01:01:02,190 --> 01:01:03,958
Come on, you fuck!

579
01:01:08,073 --> 01:01:10,027
You hear the bones cracking, Diaz.
Come on, that's enough.

580
01:01:10,028 --> 01:01:11,908
Fucking mut! Come on.

581
01:01:11,909 --> 01:01:13,039
Let him have this.

582
01:01:13,074 --> 01:01:15,637
Little Fido here wants to go home.

583
01:01:16,917 --> 01:01:18,996
He wants to see his brothers.

584
01:01:18,997 --> 01:01:21,038
Jesus, he's crazy.

585
01:01:21,238 --> 01:01:23,079
That's what I'm gonna do...

586
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:25,832
I'm gonna help him to get there.

587
01:01:34,045 --> 01:01:36,883
Say goodbye boys.

588
01:01:51,971 --> 01:01:54,617
Take it back, motherfucker!

589
01:02:56,319 --> 01:02:58,154
We should keep moving.

590
01:03:10,126 --> 01:03:12,925
These goddamn things are calling us out.

591
01:03:12,926 --> 01:03:15,207
What the hell are you talking about, Talget?

592
01:03:15,408 --> 01:03:19,408
Wolves are the only animal
that will seek revenge.

593
01:03:19,409 --> 01:03:22,406
Hey, I don't wanna hear anymore
about fucking wolves

594
01:03:22,407 --> 01:03:25,170
or you're gonna start
seeing them everywhere.

595
01:03:26,473 --> 01:03:28,190
Burke, how are you doin'?

596
01:03:28,654 --> 01:03:31,717
I can't breath.
I can't keep going.

597
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:34,295
Ottway, we can't keep going.

598
01:03:34,596 --> 01:03:36,897
We can't stop.
Those things will be all over us.

599
01:03:37,198 --> 01:03:38,833
We gotta keep going.

600
01:03:40,139 --> 01:03:43,502
Ottway, Burke is hurting here, man.

601
01:03:49,062 --> 01:03:50,508
This'll work.

602
01:03:53,944 --> 01:03:55,265
It's a dead end!

603
01:03:55,666 --> 01:03:57,590
They can't get in behind us.

604
01:03:58,027 --> 01:04:00,512
They'll have to hit us from out front.

605
01:04:00,909 --> 01:04:02,291
Let's build a fire.

606
01:04:11,594 --> 01:04:13,112
That thing still workin'?

607
01:04:13,313 --> 01:04:15,073
Up to forty thousand feet.

608
01:04:15,354 --> 01:04:18,294
This shit has to save somebody
at some point, right?

609
01:04:18,895 --> 01:04:20,830
I keep sittin' here thinkin',

610
01:04:21,537 --> 01:04:26,356
even with all this stuff goin' on, that we hit
the ground at four hundred miles an hour,

611
01:04:27,799 --> 01:04:29,481
and we made it.

612
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:33,521
Why would we go through
something like that, that crash,

613
01:04:33,522 --> 01:04:37,964
if it wasn't meant to be?
Or ordained?

614
01:04:38,564 --> 01:04:41,585
By who? The almighty?

615
01:04:42,326 --> 01:04:44,447
That fucking fairy tale?

616
01:04:44,687 --> 01:04:47,247
How's about good
old fashioned blind luck?

617
01:04:47,548 --> 01:04:52,025
Flannery survived that crash,
so did Hernandez. It don't matter,

618
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:55,115
if they didn't give a fuck.

619
01:04:57,152 --> 01:04:58,459
Dead is dead.

620
01:05:00,453 --> 01:05:02,533
Where do you think
those boys are now?

621
01:05:02,534 --> 01:05:03,655
Up in heaven?

622
01:05:04,375 --> 01:05:05,907
Getting fit for wings?

623
01:05:07,457 --> 01:05:10,057
No. I'll tell you where they are.

624
01:05:11,498 --> 01:05:13,659
They're not, that's where.

625
01:05:16,142 --> 01:05:18,927
They're no where.
They're gone.

626
01:05:19,863 --> 01:05:22,342
Well, I don't believe it.

627
01:05:24,183 --> 01:05:25,306
I do.

628
01:05:27,025 --> 01:05:32,308
I wish I didn't. I really wish
I could believe in that stuff.

629
01:05:34,629 --> 01:05:37,069
This is real. The cold.

630
01:05:39,570 --> 01:05:42,070
That's real, the air in my lungs.

631
01:05:42,872 --> 01:05:47,424
Those bastards, out there in the dark,
stalking us.

632
01:05:48,035 --> 01:05:51,930
It's this world that I'm worried about,
Talget, not the next.

633
01:05:51,961 --> 01:05:53,641
What about your faith?

634
01:05:54,197 --> 01:05:55,418
What about it?

635
01:05:57,398 --> 01:05:58,866
It's important.

636
01:06:02,521 --> 01:06:04,856
Emma... is she with you guys?

637
01:06:05,202 --> 01:06:06,082
It’s ok, big guy.

638
01:06:06,083 --> 01:06:08,722
She was out the back house.
Speaking with her... she is...

639
01:06:08,723 --> 01:06:10,562
She is, she is not here.

640
01:06:10,563 --> 01:06:14,165
- She’s not here. Why don’t you…
- You tell her, that I am here...

641
01:06:14,166 --> 01:06:18,442
Of course, yeah, just lie down, she is
coming. - That was good.

642
01:06:19,603 --> 01:06:21,129
Yeah.

643
01:06:23,651 --> 01:06:25,558
He's seeing things?

644
01:06:25,730 --> 01:06:28,465
He's hallucinating, it's hypoxia.

645
01:06:28,566 --> 01:06:30,702
Not enough oxygen is getting to his brain.

646
01:06:30,893 --> 01:06:31,693
Hypoxia.

647
01:06:33,534 --> 01:06:37,109
- Why don't the rest of us have it?
- Uh... it depends on the person.

648
01:06:37,210 --> 01:06:39,857
Some people can't handle the altitude.

649
01:06:42,939 --> 01:06:44,539
Who is Emma?

650
01:06:44,674 --> 01:06:46,640
She was, his sister.

651
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:50,709
She died when he was a kid.

652
01:06:56,144 --> 01:06:57,751
My daughter, Mary,

653
01:07:01,046 --> 01:07:03,895
she's got really long hair,
almost down to her waist.

654
01:07:04,648 --> 01:07:06,247
In fact it's the one rule,

655
01:07:06,268 --> 01:07:10,030
my fucking ex respects, which is that
I'm the only one who cuts her hair.

656
01:07:11,531 --> 01:07:12,590
She does this thing,

657
01:07:12,601 --> 01:07:15,046
she'll come and hover over me,

658
01:07:14,147 --> 01:07:17,073
I'll just be dead asleep,

659
01:07:18,153 --> 01:07:20,449
and she'll start swinging
her head back and forth,

660
01:07:20,550 --> 01:07:24,463
tickling me with her...
with her hair all in my face

661
01:07:25,117 --> 01:07:27,117
and she'll be laughing like crazy.

662
01:07:29,479 --> 01:07:31,783
Just... it's a certain type of laugh,
you know,

663
01:07:31,854 --> 01:07:33,641
when a kid goes past
laughing to laughing like a...

664
01:07:36,662 --> 01:07:40,389
Like they can't really breathe.
Sound more like an old man than a kid.

665
01:07:47,527 --> 01:07:49,276
I miss the hell out of that kid.

666
01:07:49,926 --> 01:07:50,926
Yeah.

667
01:07:51,809 --> 01:07:54,355
You should. You know that?

668
01:07:55,850 --> 01:07:59,588
Those facts of your life,
whatever they might be,

669
01:08:01,973 --> 01:08:05,253
make you want that next minute more
than the last.

670
01:08:06,254 --> 01:08:08,728
Make you fight for it.

671
01:08:13,017 --> 01:08:15,658
I just wanna fuck one more time.

672
01:08:17,580 --> 01:08:21,380
- You ruined my story. Motherfucker.
- No, man. - I'm telling a... - No, man.

673
01:08:21,381 --> 01:08:23,783
I'm telling a nice little sweet story
about my daughter.

674
01:08:23,784 --> 01:08:25,284
I don't mean to wreck your shit, bro.

675
01:08:25,485 --> 01:08:26,285
I don't, I don't.

676
01:08:26,583 --> 01:08:29,878
I just can't go out on that last piece of horrible
ass that I had. You know what I'm saying?

677
01:08:30,209 --> 01:08:32,526
Fifty three year old hooker, half Eskimo.

678
01:08:32,550 --> 01:08:34,106
You shouldn't talk about that.

679
01:08:34,107 --> 01:08:37,706
She was 250-260, no shit.

680
01:08:38,809 --> 01:08:41,239
The bitch gave me the clap
like it was gift wrapped.

681
01:08:41,340 --> 01:08:42,440
No, no, no.

682
01:08:49,713 --> 01:08:51,034
That ain't right.

683
01:08:51,754 --> 01:08:56,862
No, I just didn't think that I would... I would punch
out and that would be my fucking swan song, right?

684
01:09:00,438 --> 01:09:04,615
That alone is worth a fight.
That's worth a fight.

685
01:09:05,361 --> 01:09:11,361
My uh... my dad was not without love.

686
01:09:19,847 --> 01:09:23,969
But a cliched Irish motherfucker

687
01:09:24,004 --> 01:09:25,825
when he wanted to be.

688
01:09:26,059 --> 01:09:28,869
Drinker, brawler, all that stuff.

689
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:31,944
Never shed a tear,

690
01:09:32,132 --> 01:09:34,431
it's a weakness everywhere.

691
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:41,940
But he had this thing for

692
01:09:42,597 --> 01:09:44,697
poems, poetry.

693
01:09:45,538 --> 01:09:47,159
Reading them, quoting them,

694
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:51,289
probably thought it rounded him off,
you know?

695
01:09:53,622 --> 01:09:56,363
His way of apologizing I guess.

696
01:09:59,144 --> 01:10:02,807
And there was one that hung over
the desk in his den.

697
01:10:03,225 --> 01:10:06,346
It was only when I was
a lot older I realized

698
01:10:06,781 --> 01:10:08,368
he'd written it.

699
01:10:09,629 --> 01:10:11,471
It was untitled,

700
01:10:12,029 --> 01:10:13,471
four lines.

701
01:10:14,950 --> 01:10:16,974
I read it at his funeral.

702
01:10:21,713 --> 01:10:27,697
Once more into the fray.
Into the last good fight I'll ever know.

703
01:10:29,478 --> 01:10:32,159
Live and die on this day

704
01:10:33,238 --> 01:10:37,281
Live and die on this day.

705
01:11:07,774 --> 01:11:09,306
Storm clouds.

706
01:11:09,895 --> 01:11:10,936
Blizzard?

707
01:11:11,736 --> 01:11:12,936
A good bet.

708
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:14,523
Based on our luck.

709
01:11:16,424 --> 01:11:17,524
It's our fucking luck.

710
01:11:17,818 --> 01:11:21,580
Let's bundle Burke up
and dig in against these trees,

711
01:11:21,581 --> 01:11:23,227
snow's deep enough.

712
01:11:23,861 --> 01:11:28,550
I'm worried if we lose this fire,
we'll all freeze.

713
01:11:42,588 --> 01:11:44,589
Burke, moving on.

714
01:11:44,790 --> 01:11:46,144
Come on, Burke, wake up!

715
01:11:47,405 --> 01:11:50,518
Burke! Wake up!

716
01:11:50,553 --> 01:11:53,349
Listen, Burke, wake up!
Do you hear me?

717
01:11:53,793 --> 01:11:55,539
Don't sleep, you hear me?

718
01:11:56,515 --> 01:11:58,035
Burke, come on!

719
01:11:58,036 --> 01:12:00,382
Wake up, Burke, Burke!

720
01:12:03,278 --> 01:12:06,120
Burke, Burke! Wake up!

721
01:12:06,839 --> 01:12:09,381
Wake up, wake up!

722
01:12:10,816 --> 01:12:13,823
Wake up right now.
Wake...

723
01:13:51,886 --> 01:13:53,582
Don't be afraid!

724
01:14:20,438 --> 01:14:21,438
What is it?

725
01:14:22,899 --> 01:14:25,534
Guys, get up, up!

726
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:28,246
What is it?
Is it them?

727
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:43,487
Saw marks.
These trees have been logged.

728
01:14:46,507 --> 01:14:50,364
That's water!
That sounds like a river.

729
01:15:09,563 --> 01:15:11,368
You gotta be shittin' me!

730
01:15:11,918 --> 01:15:15,440
The river must be a good size
if we can hear it all the way up here.

731
01:15:15,526 --> 01:15:19,100
At least if we're following a river,
we got a better chance of finding shelter.

732
01:15:20,501 --> 01:15:21,755
Who's climbing down that?

733
01:15:22,418 --> 01:15:24,623
I can't. There's no way I can do that.

734
01:15:24,670 --> 01:15:28,757
Well, we can't go back.
There's no way we can go back.

735
01:15:29,660 --> 01:15:32,890
- Those trees though.
- What trees?

736
01:15:33,813 --> 01:15:35,018
Them out there.

737
01:15:35,689 --> 01:15:41,010
We got a tether of some kind, secure it
between here and there. We can climb down.

738
01:15:42,196 --> 01:15:46,602
Guys, it's simple.
It's the wolves or those trees.

739
01:15:48,204 --> 01:15:50,435
You're not talking about
jumping off the cliff?

740
01:15:50,556 --> 01:15:53,352
It's an idea, I didn't say
it was a good one.

741
01:15:55,168 --> 01:15:57,926
He's talking about jumping off the cliff.

742
01:16:12,890 --> 01:16:14,975
This will wind up
being one of those wild stories

743
01:16:14,977 --> 01:16:18,605
you tell at a party,
pretty girl on your lap.

744
01:16:19,796 --> 01:16:23,108
- All right, are you ready?
- Yeah, why not?

745
01:16:23,509 --> 01:16:25,404
Go get a good running start,
get a grip.

746
01:16:26,139 --> 01:16:28,506
Now you'll free fall about thirty feet,

747
01:16:28,521 --> 01:16:29,955
but it's gonna feel
like thirty thousand.

748
01:16:30,156 --> 01:16:32,329
Is this supposed to pass for a pep talk?

749
01:16:32,830 --> 01:16:35,243
When we feel this go taut,
we'll take up the slack

750
01:16:35,244 --> 01:16:37,358
to stop you from hitting too hard.

751
01:16:37,909 --> 01:16:39,214
When you get in there.

752
01:16:39,316 --> 01:16:40,360
I'll figure it out.

753
01:16:41,394 --> 01:16:43,826
If you gotta go, this is
a pretty cool way to go, bro.

754
01:16:43,967 --> 01:16:46,921
Better a flying leap
than those fucking wolves, right?

755
01:16:57,608 --> 01:16:59,604
I hope there's something down there.

756
01:17:05,462 --> 01:17:06,299
Fuck!

757
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:08,203
Go, go, go, go...

758
01:17:23,784 --> 01:17:26,349
Which one of you fuckers…

759
01:17:31,847 --> 01:17:32,938
Pull me up!

760
01:17:36,038 --> 01:17:38,080
Fuck! Pull me back!

761
01:17:43,103 --> 01:17:44,222
Hendrick!

762
01:17:49,530 --> 01:17:51,358
Hendrick, you in there?

763
01:17:52,763 --> 01:17:55,038
Yeah! I'm all right!

764
01:18:07,133 --> 01:18:09,763
Anyone with the nards to go first?

765
01:18:09,927 --> 01:18:10,924
Talget?

766
01:18:11,365 --> 01:18:12,361
Diaz?

767
01:18:13,879 --> 01:18:14,878
I'll go.

768
01:18:22,681 --> 01:18:24,198
Don't stay out there too long.

769
01:18:25,156 --> 01:18:28,796
Hendrick! Make sure that thing is secure!

770
01:18:30,165 --> 01:18:33,430
It's secure, but I don't know
how long it's gonna last!

771
01:18:33,450 --> 01:18:36,042
Don't spend a lot of time out there!

772
01:18:38,587 --> 01:18:39,665
You all right?

773
01:18:40,203 --> 01:18:41,260
Yeah. You go.

774
01:18:41,271 --> 01:18:42,338
What about your hand?

775
01:18:42,374 --> 01:18:43,593
I'm all right.

776
01:18:44,295 --> 01:18:46,689
Go ahead. Just haul me in
if anything goes wrong.

777
01:18:46,690 --> 01:18:47,689
Yeah.

778
01:18:50,442 --> 01:18:53,232
Just fucking hate heights, man.
Flips me out.

779
01:18:54,934 --> 01:18:56,549
Well then you go,
I’ll stay and make sure...

780
01:18:56,550 --> 01:19:01,408
No. I'm good. You cross, seriously.
Give me a minute to get my head around it.

781
01:19:02,498 --> 01:19:05,088
All right, I’m through.
I’m across.

782
01:19:06,130 --> 01:19:07,128
I'm coming!

783
01:19:14,911 --> 01:19:15,909
All right!

784
01:19:16,428 --> 01:19:18,407
I'm coming to cross now.

785
01:19:30,878 --> 01:19:31,876
Okay.

786
01:19:34,710 --> 01:19:36,676
Come on, you can do this.

787
01:19:37,544 --> 01:19:38,924
You can do this.

788
01:19:46,964 --> 01:19:49,971
Talget, you ready?

789
01:21:11,516 --> 01:21:15,254
Talget, stop fucking around!
Move your ass!

790
01:22:12,702 --> 01:22:14,412
Hey, baby girl.

791
01:22:19,729 --> 01:22:22,309
Hey, baby girl.

792
01:22:25,227 --> 01:22:26,946
I love you, daddy.

793
01:22:33,104 --> 01:22:35,268
- Oh, God, no!
- Fucking killing him!

794
01:22:35,842 --> 01:22:38,502
- No, no!
- Diaz don't.

795
01:22:40,639 --> 01:22:41,959
They're killing him!

796
01:22:42,020 --> 01:22:43,438
Talget!

797
01:22:50,276 --> 01:22:52,767
They fucking took him!
No, no, no!

798
01:22:54,633 --> 01:22:55,932
Fuck!

799
01:22:58,592 --> 01:22:59,631
Talget!

800
01:22:59,641 --> 01:23:00,610
They took him!

801
01:23:00,611 --> 01:23:03,169
- They took him! Talget!
- They fucking took us!

802
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:05,175
They took him!

803
01:23:10,547 --> 01:23:11,814
My knee!

804
01:23:11,947 --> 01:23:13,778
My fucking knee!

805
01:23:34,256 --> 01:23:35,594
They're just picking us off,

806
01:23:36,295 --> 01:23:37,576
one by one.

807
01:23:40,982 --> 01:23:44,421
I'm fucked. I'm fucked.
Ah! My knee!

808
01:23:44,655 --> 01:23:46,182
- Let's get you up.
- I can't!

809
01:23:46,219 --> 01:23:48,210
- Let's get you up.
- I can’t… fuck.

810
01:23:48,579 --> 01:23:51,085
Motherfucking things.

811
01:23:59,693 --> 01:24:01,867
They're not gonna let us go,
are they?

812
01:24:11,647 --> 01:24:13,048
What do you do?

813
01:26:18,510 --> 01:26:19,709
Fuck it!

814
01:26:45,059 --> 01:26:46,258
Forget it.

815
01:26:53,415 --> 01:26:56,528
Whatever I had in the tank
I used back there.

816
01:26:58,012 --> 01:26:59,179
I'm beat.

817
01:27:02,048 --> 01:27:04,810
I just want to sit.
I just wanna...

818
01:27:08,328 --> 01:27:10,135
stop this bullshit.

819
01:27:12,964 --> 01:27:14,433
My fucking leg.

820
01:27:18,521 --> 01:27:20,707
My ankle's fucked.

821
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:23,599
Diaz. Don't sit down.

822
01:27:24,681 --> 01:27:25,912
Don't sit down.

823
01:27:25,913 --> 01:27:26,911
I know, I know...

824
01:27:29,678 --> 01:27:31,298
I don't wanna argue.

825
01:27:33,196 --> 01:27:35,092
I just wanna rest.

826
01:27:48,069 --> 01:27:50,328
I just had the clearest thought.

827
01:27:56,286 --> 01:27:57,817
I'm done.

828
01:27:59,883 --> 01:28:01,114
I'm done.

829
01:28:03,963 --> 01:28:05,641
Come on, man. Up.

830
01:28:08,599 --> 01:28:11,182
There could be a cabin down river,
right there.

831
01:28:12,478 --> 01:28:15,255
That's a mile up at least, brother.

832
01:28:15,356 --> 01:28:17,429
I can't walk that, man.

833
01:28:19,555 --> 01:28:21,374
I can't walk fifty feet.

834
01:28:27,071 --> 01:28:28,303
Fuck it.

835
01:28:30,949 --> 01:28:32,619
Fuck it.

836
01:28:37,946 --> 01:28:39,403
I gave it a shot.

837
01:28:46,022 --> 01:28:49,124
What the fuck, man?
Are you serious?

838
01:28:49,661 --> 01:28:52,348
I really thought
this fucking watch would work.

839
01:29:01,735 --> 01:29:03,555
Does it slide over you?

840
01:29:06,732 --> 01:29:11,636
You told Lewenden back in the plane that it...
it slides over you.

841
01:29:13,770 --> 01:29:15,601
Death.

842
01:29:19,646 --> 01:29:20,953
That it was warm.

843
01:29:22,686 --> 01:29:24,741
- Is that true?
- Yeah.

844
01:29:27,923 --> 01:29:28,962
We carry him.

845
01:29:29,482 --> 01:29:32,906
We put a litter together,
slide him down the banks.

846
01:29:39,037 --> 01:29:40,632
I'm not going anywhere, Hendrick.

847
01:29:42,957 --> 01:29:44,327
I don't want to.

848
01:29:48,074 --> 01:29:49,820
I don't need to.

849
01:29:54,311 --> 01:29:58,610
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Is that it? You're just gonna sit there?

850
01:29:58,743 --> 01:30:00,318
Is that what you want?

851
01:30:00,352 --> 01:30:01,271
Yeah.

852
01:30:01,306 --> 01:30:03,507
After what we survived?

853
01:30:05,266 --> 01:30:06,744
That's exactly why.

854
01:30:10,103 --> 01:30:12,682
What do I got waiting for me back there?

855
01:30:15,382 --> 01:30:21,138
Gonna sit on a drill all day,
get drunk all night.

856
01:30:21,698 --> 01:30:23,743
That's my life.

857
01:30:26,057 --> 01:30:28,875
Turn around and look at that.

858
01:30:31,534 --> 01:30:33,973
I feel like that's all for me.

859
01:30:35,373 --> 01:30:37,732
How do I beat that?

860
01:30:39,450 --> 01:30:41,611
When would it ever be better?

861
01:30:44,367 --> 01:30:46,039
I can't explain it.

862
01:30:50,245 --> 01:30:52,440
I don't have the words, brother.

863
01:31:12,035 --> 01:31:13,931
My first name is John.

864
01:31:23,909 --> 01:31:26,004
My first name is Pete.

865
01:31:27,068 --> 01:31:28,067
Pete.

866
01:31:29,668 --> 01:31:31,198
You look like a Pete.

867
01:31:45,699 --> 01:31:47,259
John Ottway.

868
01:31:50,298 --> 01:31:52,531
Of course that's your name.

869
01:31:55,055 --> 01:31:59,413
Thank you, John.
Thank you.

870
01:32:00,574 --> 01:32:01,572
Thank you.

871
01:32:09,769 --> 01:32:10,861
Luck.

872
01:33:29,331 --> 01:33:31,002
I'm not afraid.

873
01:34:01,158 --> 01:34:02,827
Can I ask you something?

874
01:34:05,795 --> 01:34:06,836
Yeah.

875
01:34:07,475 --> 01:34:10,052
Where were you going that night?

876
01:34:10,953 --> 01:34:12,962
That last night in camp,

877
01:34:14,991 --> 01:34:16,272
at the bar?

878
01:34:23,507 --> 01:34:25,177
You had your rifle,

879
01:34:26,026 --> 01:34:27,408
you went out.

880
01:34:28,625 --> 01:34:30,105
My shift.

881
01:34:30,106 --> 01:34:31,104
No.

882
01:34:32,942 --> 01:34:35,640
You worked that morning,
I remember.

883
01:34:36,741 --> 01:34:38,197
I went out, yeah.

884
01:34:41,260 --> 01:34:42,790
With your rifle.

885
01:34:50,895 --> 01:34:52,201
Did you follow me?

886
01:34:55,652 --> 01:34:56,652
No,

887
01:34:59,731 --> 01:35:03,028
but I never thought
I'd see you alive again.

888
01:35:05,448 --> 01:35:08,054
Back there with Diaz,

889
01:35:08,395 --> 01:35:12,925
that look he had.
I've only seen it one other time,

890
01:35:13,926 --> 01:35:15,925
on you,

891
01:35:16,532 --> 01:35:18,642
that last night in camp.

892
01:35:30,808 --> 01:35:33,065
It really doesn't matter now, does it?

893
01:35:36,443 --> 01:35:38,627
No, I don't suppose it does.

894
01:35:59,552 --> 01:36:00,993
Hendrick run, run!

895
01:36:26,580 --> 01:36:27,582
Hendrick!

896
01:36:45,213 --> 01:36:46,213
Hendrick!

897
01:36:53,608 --> 01:36:54,607
Hendrick!

898
01:37:05,083 --> 01:37:06,083
Hendrick!

899
01:37:16,878 --> 01:37:17,957
Hendrick!

900
01:37:19,957 --> 01:37:20,956
Hendrick!

901
01:37:25,714 --> 01:37:26,957
Hendrick, hold on!

902
01:37:31,958 --> 01:37:33,158
Hang on!

903
01:37:33,870 --> 01:37:35,349
What the fuck are you doing?!

904
01:37:38,708 --> 01:37:40,114
Look at me!

905
01:37:45,424 --> 01:37:47,330
Hold your breath!

906
01:37:47,504 --> 01:37:48,503
Hold your breath!

907
01:37:51,742 --> 01:37:53,712
Goddammit, hold your breath!

908
01:38:15,790 --> 01:38:18,610
Jesus, please don't do this!

909
01:39:43,031 --> 01:39:44,450
Do something.

910
01:39:48,469 --> 01:39:49,549
Do something.

911
01:39:53,345 --> 01:39:55,289
You phony prick.

912
01:39:56,245 --> 01:39:58,764
Fraudulent motherfucker.

913
01:39:59,993 --> 01:40:01,443
Do something!

914
01:40:02,422 --> 01:40:07,541
Come on! Prove it!
Fuck faith! Earn it!

915
01:40:08,859 --> 01:40:10,970
Show me something real!

916
01:40:13,255 --> 01:40:15,854
I need it now,
not later!

917
01:40:16,136 --> 01:40:17,137
Now!

918
01:40:19,213 --> 01:40:23,060
Show me and I'll believe in you
until the day I die!

919
01:40:23,292 --> 01:40:25,930
I swear.
I'm calling on you!

920
01:40:27,931 --> 01:40:29,525
I'm calling on you!

921
01:40:56,396 --> 01:40:59,761
Fuck it. I'll do it myself.

922
01:41:06,152 --> 01:41:07,597
I'll do it myself.

923
01:46:28,965 --> 01:46:30,464
A den.

924
01:46:32,842 --> 01:46:34,963
It's a fucking den.

925
01:47:18,002 --> 01:47:19,697
Don't be afraid.

926
01:48:35,956 --> 01:48:37,849
Once more into the fray.

927
01:48:39,604 --> 01:48:42,102
Into the last good fight I'll ever know.

928
01:48:43,622 --> 01:48:46,460
Live and die on this day.

929
01:48:49,020 --> 01:48:52,497
Live and die

930
01:48:54,998 --> 01:48:57,098
on this day.
