1
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,843
When the boy was born...

2
00:01:11,721 --> 00:01:13,814
...like all Spartans, he was inspected.

3
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:20,255
If he'd been small or puny
or sickly or misshapen...

4
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,762
...he would have been discarded.

5
00:01:29,873 --> 00:01:35,573
From the time he could stand,
he was baptized in the fire of combat.

6
00:01:57,634 --> 00:02:01,297
Taught never to retreat,
never to surrender.

7
00:02:01,471 --> 00:02:06,340
Taught that death on the battlefield
in service to Sparta...

8
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:09,842
...was the greatest glory
he could achieve in his life.

9
00:02:24,994 --> 00:02:29,522
At age 7,
as is customary in Sparta...

10
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:34,864
...the boy was taken from his mother
and plunged into a world of violence.

11
00:02:35,672 --> 00:02:40,200
Manufactured by 300 years
of Spartan warrior society...

12
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:45,544
...to create the finest soldiers
the world has ever known.

13
00:02:45,715 --> 00:02:50,277
The agoge, as it's called,
forces the boy to fight.

14
00:02:50,453 --> 00:02:54,082
Starves them,
forces them to steal...

15
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:58,626
...and if necessary, to kill.

16
00:02:59,696 --> 00:03:02,688
By rod and lash
the boy was punished...

17
00:03:02,866 --> 00:03:06,165
...taught to show no pain,
no mercy.

18
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:11,363
Constantly tested,
tossed into the wild.

19
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:16,843
Left to pit his wits and will
against nature's fury.

20
00:03:17,213 --> 00:03:19,408
It was his initiation...

21
00:03:19,582 --> 00:03:22,142
...his time in the wild...

22
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:26,812
...for he would return
to his people a Spartan...

23
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:29,117
...or not at all.

24
00:03:51,447 --> 00:03:54,314
The wolf begins to circle the boy.

25
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,918
Claws of black steel...

26
00:03:57,086 --> 00:03:59,316
...fur as dark night.

27
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,153
Eyes glowing red...

28
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:05,260
...jewels from
the pit of hell itself.

29
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:17,996
The giant wolf sniffing...

30
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:21,234
...savoring the scent
of the meal to come.

31
00:04:45,401 --> 00:04:46,925
It's not fear that grips him...

32
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:50,700
...only a heightened
sense of things.

33
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,407
The cold air in his lungs.

34
00:04:54,978 --> 00:04:58,311
Windswept pines
moving against the coming night.

35
00:05:06,322 --> 00:05:08,722
His hands are steady.

36
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:11,155
His form...

37
00:05:11,327 --> 00:05:13,420
...perfect.

38
00:05:39,222 --> 00:05:41,952
And so the boy,
given up for dead...

39
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:46,858
...returns to his people,
to sacred Sparta, a king!

40
00:05:47,296 --> 00:05:51,027
Our king, Leonidas!

41
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:00,705
It's been more than 30 years
since the wolf and the winter cold.

42
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:06,411
And now, as then, a beast approaches.

43
00:06:06,582 --> 00:06:11,519
Patient and confident,
savoring the meal to come.

44
00:06:12,155 --> 00:06:15,454
But this beast
is made of men and horses...

45
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,423
...swords and spears.

46
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:23,588
An army of slaves, vast beyond imagining,
ready to devour tiny Greece.

47
00:06:23,933 --> 00:06:28,700
Ready to snuff out the world's
one hope for reason and justice.

48
00:06:31,441 --> 00:06:34,205
A beast approaches...

49
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:42,508
...and it was King Leonidas himself
who provoked it.

50
00:07:53,156 --> 00:07:54,987
That's it.

51
00:07:55,324 --> 00:08:00,193
Now, the more you sweat here,
the less you'll bleed in battle.

52
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,865
My father taught me...

53
00:08:04,033 --> 00:08:06,501
...that fear is always a constant.

54
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:08,193
But accepting it...

55
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:09,697
...makes you stronger.

56
00:08:09,872 --> 00:08:11,237
My queen.

57
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:14,240
A Persian emissary awaits Leonidas.

58
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:18,178
In the end...

59
00:08:18,347 --> 00:08:21,908
...a Spartan's true strength
is the warrior next to him.

60
00:08:22,685 --> 00:08:27,179
So give respect and honor to him,
and it will be returned to you.

61
00:08:27,723 --> 00:08:29,213
First...

62
00:08:29,992 --> 00:08:32,927
- ...you fight with your head.
- Then you fight with your heart.

63
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:36,959
What is it?

64
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,065
A Persian messenger awaits you.

65
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,837
Do not forget today's lesson.

66
00:08:43,005 --> 00:08:45,701
- Respect and honor.
- Respect and honor.

67
00:09:01,224 --> 00:09:05,684
Councilman Theron.
You found yourself needed, for once.

68
00:09:06,762 --> 00:09:09,697
My king and queen,
I was just entertaining your guests.

69
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:11,127
I'm sure.

70
00:09:12,368 --> 00:09:14,199
Before you speak, Persian...

71
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:17,635
...know that in Sparta everyone,
even a king's messenger...

72
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:20,401
...is held accountable
for the words of his voice.

73
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:24,140
Now, what message do you bring?

74
00:09:25,248 --> 00:09:27,716
Earth and water.

75
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:33,615
You rode all the way from Persia
for earth and water?

76
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:39,093
Do not be coy or stupid, Persian.
You can afford neither in Sparta.

77
00:09:39,595 --> 00:09:42,063
What makes this woman
think she can speak among men?

78
00:09:42,231 --> 00:09:45,064
Because only Spartan women
give birth to real men.

79
00:09:46,569 --> 00:09:50,164
Let us walk to cool our tongues.

80
00:09:52,775 --> 00:09:55,938
If you value your lives
over your complete annihilation...

81
00:09:56,112 --> 00:09:57,773
...listen carefully, Leonidas.

82
00:09:57,947 --> 00:10:02,646
Xerxes conquers and controls
everything he rests his eyes upon.

83
00:10:02,818 --> 00:10:05,912
He leads an army so massive,
it shakes the ground with its march.

84
00:10:06,088 --> 00:10:08,784
So vast, it drinks the rivers dry.

85
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:11,950
All the God-King Xerxes requires is this:

86
00:10:12,295 --> 00:10:15,526
A simple offering of earth and water...

87
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:19,862
...a token of Sparta's submission
to the will of Xerxes.

88
00:10:30,913 --> 00:10:33,074
Submission.

89
00:10:35,251 --> 00:10:37,185
Now, that's a bit of a problem.

90
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,848
See, rumor has it...

91
00:10:39,021 --> 00:10:41,649
...the Athenians
have already turned you down.

92
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:47,791
And if those philosophers and boy-lovers
have found that kind of nerve, then--

93
00:10:47,963 --> 00:10:52,195
- We must be diplomatic.
- And, of course, Spartans...

94
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:55,294
...have their reputation to consider.

95
00:10:55,471 --> 00:10:59,498
Choose your next words carefully,
Leonidas.

96
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:02,370
They may be your last as king.

97
00:11:42,852 --> 00:11:46,151
"Earth and water."

98
00:11:51,427 --> 00:11:53,520
Madman. You're a madman.

99
00:11:53,696 --> 00:11:55,357
Earth and water.

100
00:11:55,731 --> 00:11:57,892
You'll find plenty of both down there.

101
00:11:58,167 --> 00:12:01,603
No man, Persian or Greek,
no man threatens a messenger.

102
00:12:02,071 --> 00:12:07,031
You bring the crowns and heads
of conquered kings to my city steps.

103
00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:09,268
You insult my queen.

104
00:12:09,445 --> 00:12:13,176
You threaten my people
with slavery and death.

105
00:12:13,349 --> 00:12:16,284
Oh, I've chosen my words carefully,
Persian.

106
00:12:16,452 --> 00:12:18,420
Perhaps you should have done the same.

107
00:12:18,587 --> 00:12:22,250
This is blasphemy. This is madness!

108
00:12:39,642 --> 00:12:41,701
Madness?

109
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,471
This is Sparta!

110
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,366
Welcome, Leonidas.

111
00:14:13,969 --> 00:14:17,132
We have been expecting you.

112
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:28,948
The ephors,
priests to the old gods.

113
00:14:29,351 --> 00:14:31,683
Inbred swine.

114
00:14:31,854 --> 00:14:34,618
More creature than man.

115
00:14:35,057 --> 00:14:40,495
Creatures whom even Leonidas
must bribe and beg.

116
00:14:41,363 --> 00:14:46,198
For no Spartan king has gone to war
without the ephors' blessing.

117
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:51,931
The Persians claim their forces
number in the millions.

118
00:14:52,575 --> 00:14:55,840
I hope, for our sake, they exaggerate.

119
00:14:56,312 --> 00:15:00,544
But there's no question, we face
the most massive army ever assembled.

120
00:15:00,783 --> 00:15:04,116
Before your plan is heard...

121
00:15:04,286 --> 00:15:06,550
...what do you offer?

122
00:15:16,098 --> 00:15:20,432
We will use
our superior fighting skills...

123
00:15:20,603 --> 00:15:24,664
...and the terrain of Greece herself
to destroy them.

124
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,673
We will march north to the coast,
where I will make sure--

125
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:32,746
It is August, Leonidas.
The full moon approaches.

126
00:15:33,115 --> 00:15:36,312
The sacred and ancient festival.

127
00:15:36,485 --> 00:15:40,581
Sparta wages no war
at the time of the Carneia.

128
00:15:40,756 --> 00:15:42,348
Sparta will burn!

129
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:44,315
Her men will die at arms...

130
00:15:44,493 --> 00:15:48,156
...and her women and children
will be slaves or worse.

131
00:15:50,299 --> 00:15:55,362
Now, we will block
the Persian coastal assault...

132
00:15:55,671 --> 00:15:57,969
...by rebuilding the great Phocian Wall.

133
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:02,839
And from there, we will funnel them into
the mountain pass we call the Hot Gates.

134
00:16:03,012 --> 00:16:07,381
Now, in that narrow corridor,
their numbers will count for nothing.

135
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:10,143
And wave after wave of Persian attack...

136
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:14,255
...will smash against Spartan shields.

137
00:16:14,823 --> 00:16:19,123
Xerxes' losses will be so great,
his men so demoralized...

138
00:16:19,294 --> 00:16:23,697
...he will have no choice
but to abandon his campaign.

139
00:16:23,866 --> 00:16:26,562
We must consult the oracle.

140
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:29,863
Trust the gods, Leonidas.

141
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:33,372
I'd prefer you trusted your reason.

142
00:16:33,542 --> 00:16:35,567
Your blasphemies...

143
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:40,113
...have cost us quite enough already.

144
00:16:40,849 --> 00:16:43,875
Don't compound them.

145
00:16:45,954 --> 00:16:50,755
We will consult the oracle.

146
00:16:52,895 --> 00:16:55,386
Diseased old mystics.

147
00:16:56,398 --> 00:17:01,028
Worthless remnants of a time
before Sparta's ascent from darkness.

148
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:04,635
Remnants of a senseless tradition.

149
00:17:04,807 --> 00:17:09,176
Tradition even Leonidas
cannot defy...

150
00:17:09,344 --> 00:17:13,747
...for he must respect
the word of the ephors.

151
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,850
That is the law.

152
00:17:18,887 --> 00:17:23,221
And no Spartan, subject or citizen,
man or woman...

153
00:17:23,392 --> 00:17:27,419
...slave or king, is above the law.

154
00:18:02,297 --> 00:18:06,563
The ephors choose only
the most beautiful Spartan girls...

155
00:18:06,735 --> 00:18:09,226
...to live among them as oracles.

156
00:18:09,404 --> 00:18:12,669
Their beauty is their curse...

157
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:16,641
...for the old wretches
have the needs of men...

158
00:18:17,646 --> 00:18:21,742
...and souls as black as hell.

159
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,917
"Pray to the winds...

160
00:18:30,425 --> 00:18:32,620
...Sparta will fall.

161
00:18:35,564 --> 00:18:39,261
All Greece will fall.

162
00:18:41,436 --> 00:18:45,065
Trust not in men...

163
00:18:47,109 --> 00:18:50,374
...honor the gods.

164
00:18:54,116 --> 00:18:57,779
Honor the Carneia."

165
00:18:59,588 --> 00:19:03,183
The king's climb down is harder.

166
00:19:03,358 --> 00:19:06,259
Pompous, inbred swine.

167
00:19:06,428 --> 00:19:09,659
Worthless, diseased, rotten...

168
00:19:09,832 --> 00:19:11,857
...corrupt.

169
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:18,866
Truly, you're in the god-king's
favor now...

170
00:19:19,441 --> 00:19:21,534
...O wise and holy men.

171
00:19:21,844 --> 00:19:23,277
Yes.

172
00:19:23,445 --> 00:19:28,405
And when Sparta burns,
you shall bathe in gold.

173
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,178
Fresh oracles shall be
delivered to you...

174
00:19:31,653 --> 00:19:33,052
...daily...

175
00:19:33,222 --> 00:19:37,022
...from every corner of the empire.

176
00:20:12,694 --> 00:20:16,255
Your lips can finish
what your fingers have started.

177
00:20:19,401 --> 00:20:21,869
Or has the oracle robbed you
of your desire as well?

178
00:20:23,405 --> 00:20:26,431
It would take more than the words
of a drunken adolescent girl...

179
00:20:26,608 --> 00:20:28,303
...to rob me of my desire for you.

180
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,948
Then why so distant?

181
00:20:37,085 --> 00:20:39,076
Because it seems...

182
00:20:39,254 --> 00:20:45,193
...though a slave and captive
of lecherous old men...

183
00:20:45,527 --> 00:20:48,758
...the oracle's words
could set fire to all that I love.

184
00:20:48,931 --> 00:20:52,594
So that is why my king loses sleep
and is forced from the warmth of his bed?

185
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:59,904
There's only one woman's words that
should affect the mood of my husband.

186
00:21:00,742 --> 00:21:02,300
Those are mine.

187
00:21:06,481 --> 00:21:08,881
Then what must a king do
to save his world...

188
00:21:09,051 --> 00:21:13,488
...when the very laws he is sworn
to protect force him to do nothing?

189
00:21:16,425 --> 00:21:19,758
It is not a question
of what a Spartan citizen should do...

190
00:21:19,928 --> 00:21:22,795
...nor a husband, nor a king.

191
00:21:23,432 --> 00:21:26,128
Instead ask yourself, my dearest love...

192
00:21:27,769 --> 00:21:29,760
...what should a free man do?

193
00:22:35,237 --> 00:22:39,401
- Is this all of them?
- As you ordered. Three hundred.

194
00:22:40,409 --> 00:22:43,708
All with born sons
to carry on their name.

195
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:55,787
We are with you, sire.

196
00:22:56,158 --> 00:22:58,285
For Sparta. For freedom.

197
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,428
To the death.

198
00:23:11,239 --> 00:23:12,900
He is your son.

199
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:16,609
He is too young
to have felt a woman's warmth.

200
00:23:16,778 --> 00:23:20,737
I have others to replace him.
Astinos is as brave and ready as any.

201
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:25,110
No younger than we were the first time
you stood next to me in battle.

202
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:31,017
You are a good friend...

203
00:23:31,193 --> 00:23:34,685
...but a better captain, there is none.

204
00:23:40,202 --> 00:23:42,136
My good king.

205
00:23:43,071 --> 00:23:46,404
My good king, the oracle has spoken.

206
00:23:46,575 --> 00:23:49,442
The ephors have spoken.
There must be no march.

207
00:23:49,611 --> 00:23:51,408
It is the law, my lord.

208
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:55,573
- The Spartan army must not go to war.
- Nor shall it.

209
00:23:56,485 --> 00:23:58,077
I've issued no such orders.

210
00:23:58,453 --> 00:24:01,980
I'm here just taking a stroll,
stretching my legs.

211
00:24:02,224 --> 00:24:07,389
These 300 men
are my personal bodyguard.

212
00:24:07,662 --> 00:24:09,823
Our army will stay in Sparta.

213
00:24:10,432 --> 00:24:11,763
Where will you go?

214
00:24:14,736 --> 00:24:16,966
I hadn't really thought about it...

215
00:24:17,772 --> 00:24:19,933
...but now that you ask...

216
00:24:20,108 --> 00:24:22,838
...I suppose I'll head north.

217
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:25,371
The Hot Gates?

218
00:24:28,016 --> 00:24:30,416
Move out!

219
00:24:30,619 --> 00:24:32,678
Move out!

220
00:24:33,822 --> 00:24:35,414
What shall we do?

221
00:24:36,958 --> 00:24:38,289
What can we do?

222
00:24:38,994 --> 00:24:40,723
What can you do?

223
00:24:43,765 --> 00:24:47,599
Sparta will need sons.

224
00:25:35,383 --> 00:25:37,112
Spartan!

225
00:25:46,394 --> 00:25:47,622
Yes, milady?

226
00:26:03,712 --> 00:26:06,010
Come back with your shield...

227
00:26:06,948 --> 00:26:08,381
...or on it.

228
00:26:09,851 --> 00:26:11,216
Yes, milady.

229
00:26:19,728 --> 00:26:22,026
"Goodbye, my love."

230
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,859
He doesn't say it.

231
00:26:25,367 --> 00:26:27,597
There's no room for softness...

232
00:26:27,769 --> 00:26:29,760
...not in Sparta.

233
00:26:29,938 --> 00:26:32,702
No place for weakness.

234
00:26:36,211 --> 00:26:40,409
Only the hard and strong
may call themselves Spartans.

235
00:26:41,249 --> 00:26:45,743
Only the hard. Only the strong.

236
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:16,080
We march...

237
00:27:16,785 --> 00:27:22,280
...for our lands, for our families,
for our freedoms.

238
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:25,219
We march.

239
00:27:26,961 --> 00:27:28,622
Daxos.

240
00:27:28,797 --> 00:27:32,198
- What a pleasant surprise.
- This morning's full of surprises, Leonidas.

241
00:27:32,367 --> 00:27:34,767
- We've been tricked.
- Can't be more than a hundred.

242
00:27:34,936 --> 00:27:37,166
- This is a surprise.
- Silence.

243
00:27:37,605 --> 00:27:39,573
This isn't their army.

244
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:43,905
We heard Sparta was on the warpath
and we were eager to join forces.

245
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:48,675
If it is blood you seek,
you are welcome to join us.

246
00:27:49,017 --> 00:27:52,248
But you bring only this handful
of soldiers against Xerxes?

247
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:56,015
I see I was wrong to expect Sparta's
commitment to at least match our own.

248
00:27:57,192 --> 00:27:59,023
Doesn't it?

249
00:28:00,462 --> 00:28:02,157
You, there.

250
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:03,824
What is your profession?

251
00:28:04,366 --> 00:28:06,493
I'm a potter, sir.

252
00:28:07,669 --> 00:28:11,435
And you, Arcadian.
What is your profession?

253
00:28:11,806 --> 00:28:15,242
- Sculptor, sir.
- Sculptor.

254
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,544
- And you?
- Blacksmith.

255
00:28:22,217 --> 00:28:25,516
Spartans! What is your profession?

256
00:28:32,694 --> 00:28:34,628
You see, old friend?

257
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:37,697
I brought more soldiers than you did.

258
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:49,439
No sleep tonight...

259
00:28:50,512 --> 00:28:52,980
...not for the king.

260
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:55,378
All his 40 years
have been a straight road...

261
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:59,111
...to this one gleaming moment
in destiny...

262
00:28:59,287 --> 00:29:02,051
...this one radiant clash
of shield and spear...

263
00:29:02,223 --> 00:29:05,818
...sword and bone,
and flesh and blood.

264
00:29:07,529 --> 00:29:09,326
His only regret...

265
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:13,228
...is that he has so few
to sacrifice.

266
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:36,513
We're being followed.

267
00:29:41,563 --> 00:29:43,758
It has followed us since Sparta.

268
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:51,695
My king! Look!

269
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:14,127
What happened here?

270
00:30:14,696 --> 00:30:16,027
Where are all the people?

271
00:30:17,131 --> 00:30:18,826
Persians.

272
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,797
I put their number at around 20.

273
00:30:23,171 --> 00:30:24,536
A scouting party.

274
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:29,399
But these footprints....

275
00:30:40,788 --> 00:30:42,255
Behind us!

276
00:30:56,304 --> 00:30:57,532
Child!

277
00:31:30,505 --> 00:31:33,235
It's quiet now.

278
00:31:33,708 --> 00:31:35,505
They....

279
00:31:35,877 --> 00:31:39,904
They came with beasts
from the blackness.

280
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:43,746
With their claws and fangs...

281
00:31:43,918 --> 00:31:46,148
...they grabbed them.

282
00:31:47,055 --> 00:31:49,216
Everyone...

283
00:31:50,224 --> 00:31:52,283
...but me.

284
00:32:04,539 --> 00:32:06,097
The villagers.

285
00:32:06,641 --> 00:32:08,575
I found them.

286
00:32:20,088 --> 00:32:22,886
Have the gods no mercy?

287
00:32:24,058 --> 00:32:26,083
We are doomed.

288
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,888
Quiet yourself.

289
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:37,533
The child speaks of the Persian ghosts,
known from the ancient times.

290
00:32:38,406 --> 00:32:41,102
They are the hunters of men's souls.

291
00:32:42,143 --> 00:32:44,771
They cannot be killed or defeated.

292
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:49,544
Not this darkness. Not these Immortals.

293
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:53,914
Immortals?

294
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:57,282
We'll put their name to the test.

295
00:33:19,347 --> 00:33:22,111
Into the Hot Gates we march.

296
00:33:22,283 --> 00:33:25,582
Into that narrow corridor
we march...

297
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:28,017
...where Xerxes' numbers
count for nothing.

298
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:33,126
Spartans, citizen-soldiers,
freed slaves.

299
00:33:33,294 --> 00:33:35,194
Brave Greeks, all.

300
00:33:36,197 --> 00:33:39,291
Brothers, fathers, sons...

301
00:33:39,467 --> 00:33:41,458
...we march.

302
00:33:42,136 --> 00:33:46,334
For honor's sake, for duty's sake,
for glory's sake, we march.

303
00:33:46,507 --> 00:33:49,601
Look! Persians.

304
00:33:54,749 --> 00:33:58,480
Into hell's mouth we march.

305
00:34:07,528 --> 00:34:09,587
Let's watch these motherless dogs...

306
00:34:09,831 --> 00:34:13,892
...as they're embraced by the loving arms
of Greece herself. Come.

307
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:18,399
True.

308
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:25,078
It does look like rain.

309
00:34:28,382 --> 00:34:31,613
Zeus stabs the sky
with thunderbolts...

310
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:35,946
...and batters the Persian ships
with hurricane wind.

311
00:34:37,091 --> 00:34:39,525
Glorious.

312
00:34:51,806 --> 00:34:54,673
Only one among us
keeps his Spartan reserve.

313
00:35:00,615 --> 00:35:02,549
Only he.

314
00:35:02,717 --> 00:35:05,185
Only our king.

315
00:35:22,603 --> 00:35:24,537
My queen?

316
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,041
My queen...

317
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:34,545
...the courtyard is a more fitting place
for a married woman.

318
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:36,376
I'm afraid gossip and protocol...

319
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:39,076
...are the least of my worries now,
councilman.

320
00:35:40,755 --> 00:35:42,586
Is such secrecy needed?

321
00:35:42,757 --> 00:35:45,419
How am I to trust beyond the walls
of my own home?

322
00:35:45,593 --> 00:35:49,324
Even here, Theron has eyes and ears
which fuel Sparta with doubt and fear.

323
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:53,131
You speak as if all Sparta
conspires against you.

324
00:35:53,768 --> 00:35:55,827
I wish it were only against me.

325
00:35:58,472 --> 00:36:01,964
Many on our council
would vote to give all we have...

326
00:36:02,143 --> 00:36:04,008
...and follow Leonidas...

327
00:36:04,345 --> 00:36:06,313
...but you must show them favor.

328
00:36:08,616 --> 00:36:11,084
And you can arrange for me
to speak to the council?

329
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:13,686
If it is reason they want,
I will let them know.

330
00:36:13,855 --> 00:36:15,982
Know what, my queen?

331
00:36:16,357 --> 00:36:18,348
Freedom isn't free at all.

332
00:36:18,526 --> 00:36:21,859
That it comes with the highest of costs,
the cost of blood.

333
00:36:24,131 --> 00:36:26,759
I will do my best to gather our council.

334
00:36:27,201 --> 00:36:31,035
And its chamber
shall be filled with your voice.

335
00:36:31,372 --> 00:36:33,203
- I'm in your debt.
- No.

336
00:36:33,541 --> 00:36:37,705
Leonidas is my king as well as yours.

337
00:37:02,503 --> 00:37:04,368
I saw those ships smash on the rocks.

338
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:06,838
How can this be?

339
00:37:07,008 --> 00:37:10,307
We saw but a fraction of the monster
that is Xerxes' army.

340
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:13,378
There can be no victory here.

341
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:19,013
Why do you smile?

342
00:37:20,721 --> 00:37:22,655
Arcadian...

343
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:25,849
...I have fought countless times...

344
00:37:26,127 --> 00:37:28,789
...yet I've never met an adversary
who could offer me...

345
00:37:28,963 --> 00:37:31,124
...what we Spartans
call "a beautiful death."

346
00:37:31,933 --> 00:37:33,594
I can only hope...

347
00:37:33,768 --> 00:37:36,498
...with all the world's warriors
gathered against us...

348
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:40,334
...there might be one down there
who's up to the task.

349
00:37:51,786 --> 00:37:54,118
Move!

350
00:37:55,423 --> 00:37:58,358
Keep going, you dogs!

351
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:08,058
Move!

352
00:38:09,503 --> 00:38:12,063
Forward, I say!

353
00:38:14,408 --> 00:38:16,000
Stop here!

354
00:38:16,844 --> 00:38:19,005
Who commands here?

355
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:23,877
I am the emissary...

356
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:26,315
...to the ruler of all the world...

357
00:38:27,121 --> 00:38:31,023
...the god of gods, king of kings...

358
00:38:31,192 --> 00:38:32,784
...and by that authority...

359
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,726
...I demand that someone
show me your commander.

360
00:38:40,501 --> 00:38:46,406
Listen. Do you think the paltry dozen
you slew scares us?

361
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:50,066
These hills swarm with our scouts.

362
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:54,943
And do you think your pathetic wall
will do anything...

363
00:38:55,116 --> 00:39:01,419
...except fall like a heap of dry leaves
in the face of...?

364
00:39:13,134 --> 00:39:15,432
Our ancestors built this wall...

365
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:20,106
...using ancient stones
from the bosom of Greece herself.

366
00:39:20,541 --> 00:39:22,907
And with a little Spartan help...

367
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:25,678
...your Persian scouts
supplied the mortar.

368
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:30,239
You will pay for your barbarism!

369
00:39:49,403 --> 00:39:50,961
My arm!

370
00:39:53,541 --> 00:39:55,406
It's not yours anymore.

371
00:39:55,676 --> 00:40:00,306
Go now. Run along and tell your Xerxes
he faces free men here...

372
00:40:00,681 --> 00:40:02,046
...not slaves.

373
00:40:02,216 --> 00:40:03,444
Do it quickly...

374
00:40:03,684 --> 00:40:06,619
...before we decide to make our wall
just a little bit bigger.

375
00:40:07,121 --> 00:40:08,713
No.

376
00:40:08,889 --> 00:40:11,323
Not slaves.

377
00:40:13,127 --> 00:40:16,563
Your women will be slaves.

378
00:40:16,897 --> 00:40:19,730
Your sons, your daughters...

379
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:22,232
...your elders will be slaves!

380
00:40:22,403 --> 00:40:25,167
But not you, no.

381
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:29,400
By noon this day you will be dead men.

382
00:40:30,578 --> 00:40:36,574
A thousand nations of the Persian Empire
descend upon you.

383
00:40:36,984 --> 00:40:40,476
Our arrows will blot out the sun.

384
00:40:42,256 --> 00:40:44,952
Then we will fight in the shade.

385
00:40:46,494 --> 00:40:48,257
The wall is solid.

386
00:40:48,429 --> 00:40:51,592
It'll do the job of funneling the Persians
into the Hot Gates.

387
00:40:51,932 --> 00:40:54,628
Have the men found any route
through the hills to our back?

388
00:40:55,136 --> 00:40:57,161
None, sire.

389
00:40:57,438 --> 00:40:58,996
There is such a route, good king.

390
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,269
Just pass that western ridge.

391
00:41:01,942 --> 00:41:03,637
It's an old goat path.

392
00:41:03,811 --> 00:41:06,644
The Persians could use it to outflank us.

393
00:41:06,814 --> 00:41:10,545
Not one step closer, monster!

394
00:41:12,186 --> 00:41:15,781
Wise king, I humbly request an audience.

395
00:41:15,956 --> 00:41:19,323
- I'll skewer you where you stand.
- I gave no such order.

396
00:41:29,837 --> 00:41:31,065
Forgive the captain.

397
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,229
He is a good soldier...

398
00:41:33,807 --> 00:41:36,435
...but a bit short on manners.

399
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:40,671
There is nothing to forgive, brave king.
I know what I look like.

400
00:41:41,115 --> 00:41:43,140
You wear the crimson of a Spartan.

401
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:49,383
I am Ephialtes, born of Sparta.

402
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:54,051
My mother's love
led my parents to flee Sparta...

403
00:41:54,228 --> 00:41:55,695
...lest I be discarded.

404
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:59,028
Your shield and armor?

405
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:01,595
My father's, sir.

406
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:06,998
I beg you, bold king,
to permit me...

407
00:42:07,174 --> 00:42:12,202
...to redeem my father's name
by serving you in combat.

408
00:42:12,513 --> 00:42:18,383
My father trained me to feel no fear,
to make spear and shield and sword...

409
00:42:18,552 --> 00:42:21,282
...as much a part of me
as my own beating heart.

410
00:42:21,722 --> 00:42:25,021
I will earn my father's armor,
noble king...

411
00:42:25,192 --> 00:42:27,353
...by serving you in the battle.

412
00:42:32,533 --> 00:42:34,626
A fine thrust.

413
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:36,394
I will kill many Persians.

414
00:42:42,276 --> 00:42:43,868
Raise your shield.

415
00:42:44,044 --> 00:42:46,706
- Sire?
- Raise your shield as high as you can.

416
00:42:54,955 --> 00:42:57,981
Your father should have taught you
how our phalanx works.

417
00:42:58,659 --> 00:42:59,956
We fight...

418
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:03,395
...as a single, impenetrable unit.

419
00:43:03,564 --> 00:43:06,499
That is the source of our strength.

420
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:10,963
Each Spartan protects the man
to his left...

421
00:43:11,138 --> 00:43:14,335
...from thigh to neck with his shield.

422
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:19,172
A single weak spot
and the phalanx shatters.

423
00:43:20,581 --> 00:43:23,812
From thigh to neck, Ephialtes.

424
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:28,253
I am sorry, my friend.

425
00:43:28,422 --> 00:43:31,016
- But not all of us were made to be soldiers.
- But I--

426
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:33,625
- If you want to help in a Spartan victory...
- Yes.

427
00:43:33,794 --> 00:43:38,959
...clear the battlefield of the dead,
tend the wounded, bring them water...

428
00:43:39,133 --> 00:43:40,760
...but as for the fight itself...

429
00:43:42,136 --> 00:43:44,036
...I cannot use you.

430
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,306
You....

431
00:43:55,182 --> 00:43:59,278
Mother! Father! You were wrong!

432
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:04,319
You are wrong!

433
00:44:04,491 --> 00:44:09,019
Leonidas! You are wrong!

434
00:44:09,496 --> 00:44:11,964
Dispatch the Phocians to the goat path...

435
00:44:12,132 --> 00:44:16,660
...and pray to the gods
nobody tells the Persians about it.

436
00:44:22,376 --> 00:44:23,934
Earthquake.

437
00:44:24,478 --> 00:44:25,706
No, captain.

438
00:44:27,314 --> 00:44:29,248
Battle formations.

439
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:56,337
This is where we hold them.

440
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:58,774
This is where we fight!

441
00:44:59,346 --> 00:45:01,576
This is where they die!

442
00:45:01,915 --> 00:45:03,780
Earn these shields, boys!

443
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:09,011
Remember this day, men...

444
00:45:09,189 --> 00:45:12,920
...for it will be yours for all time.

445
00:45:24,037 --> 00:45:25,800
Spartans!

446
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:28,100
Lay down your weapons!

447
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:47,256
Persians!

448
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:49,887
Come and get them!

449
00:46:11,385 --> 00:46:13,012
Hold!

450
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:17,414
Give them nothing...

451
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:21,453
...but take from them everything!

452
00:46:23,163 --> 00:46:24,892
Steady!

453
00:46:35,676 --> 00:46:37,200
Push!

454
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:43,448
Is that the best you can do?

455
00:46:45,652 --> 00:46:47,643
Push! Push!

456
00:46:57,731 --> 00:46:59,255
Now!

457
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:12,568
Push!

458
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:58,717
No prisoners!

459
00:47:59,059 --> 00:48:00,788
No mercy!

460
00:49:20,107 --> 00:49:22,234
They look thirsty.

461
00:49:23,343 --> 00:49:26,278
Well, let's give them something to drink.

462
00:49:29,182 --> 00:49:31,844
To the cliffs.

463
00:49:55,475 --> 00:49:57,636
Halt.

464
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:01,839
Hell of a good start.

465
00:50:24,504 --> 00:50:26,972
Tuck tail!

466
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:34,004
Persian cowards.

467
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:44,723
- What the hell are you laughing at?
- Well, you had to say it.

468
00:50:45,525 --> 00:50:49,188
- What?
- "Fight in the shade."

469
00:51:02,709 --> 00:51:04,643
Recover.

470
00:51:27,934 --> 00:51:30,562
Today no Spartan dies.

471
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:57,128
Easy, son.

472
00:52:23,356 --> 00:52:25,324
We do what we were trained to do...

473
00:52:25,492 --> 00:52:26,959
...what we were bred to do...

474
00:52:27,127 --> 00:52:30,119
...what we were born to do.

475
00:52:37,504 --> 00:52:40,496
No prisoners. No mercy.

476
00:52:40,674 --> 00:52:42,141
A good start.

477
00:53:51,611 --> 00:53:54,876
- I was afraid you might not come.
- I'm sorry, my son is--

478
00:53:55,048 --> 00:54:00,645
Is doing what children do best.
Please, don't apologize.

479
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:03,782
Your son starts the agoge next year.

480
00:54:04,391 --> 00:54:08,384
That is always a difficult time
for a Spartan mother.

481
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:14,058
Yes, it will be hard. But also necessary.

482
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:20,735
You will speak before the council
in two days' time.

483
00:54:22,609 --> 00:54:24,634
My husband does not have two days.

484
00:54:25,045 --> 00:54:27,013
Think of the two days as a gift.

485
00:54:29,082 --> 00:54:31,107
It's no secret...

486
00:54:31,284 --> 00:54:34,151
...Theron wants what you control.

487
00:54:34,321 --> 00:54:37,154
It's his voice you must silence.

488
00:54:37,324 --> 00:54:39,417
Make him your ally...

489
00:54:39,726 --> 00:54:42,286
...and you will have your victory.

490
00:54:43,096 --> 00:54:44,859
Thank you.

491
00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:47,598
You are wise as you are kind.

492
00:55:14,661 --> 00:55:16,424
There's your mother.

493
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:26,338
You should keep a better eye on him
if he's to be king one day.

494
00:55:26,539 --> 00:55:29,007
Be unfortunate if anything
were to happen to him.

495
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:32,375
Or to his beautiful mother.

496
00:55:33,846 --> 00:55:35,336
No!

497
00:55:53,584 --> 00:55:59,022
Our Greek comrades are begging
for a crack at the Persians, sire.

498
00:55:59,323 --> 00:56:00,654
Good.

499
00:56:00,825 --> 00:56:03,589
I've got something
I think they can handle.

500
00:56:04,094 --> 00:56:05,789
Tell Daxos that I want him...

501
00:56:05,963 --> 00:56:10,491
...and 20 of his best eager, sober
and ready for the next charge.

502
00:56:10,668 --> 00:56:12,499
King Leonidas.

503
00:56:15,005 --> 00:56:18,805
- Stelios, catch your breath, boy.
- Yes, milord.

504
00:56:19,443 --> 00:56:21,570
The Persians are approaching.

505
00:56:22,947 --> 00:56:26,815
A small contingent.
Too small for an attack.

506
00:56:30,554 --> 00:56:34,115
- Captain, I leave you in charge.
- But sire--

507
00:56:34,291 --> 00:56:35,519
Relax, old friend.

508
00:56:35,693 --> 00:56:40,255
If they assassinate me,
all of Sparta goes to war.

509
00:56:41,198 --> 00:56:43,792
Pray they're that stupid.

510
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:46,597
Pray...

511
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:49,332
...we're that lucky.

512
00:56:52,476 --> 00:56:54,239
Besides...

513
00:56:56,514 --> 00:56:59,847
...there's no reason we can't be civil...

514
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:01,742
...is there?

515
00:57:03,087 --> 00:57:04,076
None, sire.

516
00:57:23,471 --> 00:57:25,701
Let me guess.

517
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:29,432
You must be Xerxes.

518
00:57:41,455 --> 00:57:43,650
Come, Leonidas.

519
00:57:45,092 --> 00:57:46,855
Let us reason together.

520
00:57:47,128 --> 00:57:49,096
It would be a regrettable waste...

521
00:57:49,497 --> 00:57:52,694
...it would be nothing short of madness
were you, brave king...

522
00:57:52,867 --> 00:57:56,064
...and your valiant troops to perish...

523
00:57:56,704 --> 00:57:58,763
...all because of a simple
misunderstanding.

524
00:57:59,373 --> 00:58:02,206
- There's much our cultures could share.
- Haven't you noticed?

525
00:58:02,376 --> 00:58:04,776
We've been sharing our culture
with you all morning.

526
00:58:05,379 --> 00:58:07,643
Yours is a fascinating tribe.

527
00:58:07,815 --> 00:58:09,976
Even now you are defiant...

528
00:58:10,151 --> 00:58:14,281
...in the face of annihilation
and the presence of a god.

529
00:58:14,455 --> 00:58:16,480
It isn't wise to stand against me,
Leonidas.

530
00:58:17,158 --> 00:58:19,388
Imagine what a horrible fate
awaits my enemies...

531
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:22,461
...when I would gladly kill
any of my own men for victory.

532
00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:25,258
And I would die for any one of mine.

533
00:58:25,433 --> 00:58:29,665
You Greeks take pride in your logic.
I suggest you employ it.

534
00:58:29,837 --> 00:58:33,398
Consider the beautiful land
you so vigorously defend.

535
00:58:33,574 --> 00:58:36,065
Picture it reduced to ash at my whim.

536
00:58:36,310 --> 00:58:37,777
Consider the fate of your women.

537
00:58:38,379 --> 00:58:40,904
Clearly you don't know our women.

538
00:58:41,082 --> 00:58:44,609
I might as well have marched them up here,
judging by what I've seen.

539
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:48,245
You have many slaves, Xerxes...

540
00:58:49,190 --> 00:58:51,488
...but few warriors.

541
00:58:51,659 --> 00:58:55,595
It won't be long
before they fear my spears...

542
00:58:55,997 --> 00:58:58,431
...more than your whips.

543
00:59:02,269 --> 00:59:05,136
It's not the lash they fear...

544
00:59:07,875 --> 00:59:09,536
...it is my divine power.

545
00:59:10,277 --> 00:59:14,771
But I am a generous god.
I can make you rich beyond all measure.

546
00:59:15,216 --> 00:59:17,616
I will make you warlord of all Greece.

547
00:59:18,252 --> 00:59:22,154
You will carry my battle standard
to the heart of Europa.

548
00:59:22,323 --> 00:59:24,917
Your Athenian rivals...

549
00:59:25,226 --> 00:59:27,387
...will kneel at your feet...

550
00:59:28,095 --> 00:59:30,893
...if you will but kneel at mine.

551
00:59:31,732 --> 00:59:33,996
You are generous...

552
00:59:34,568 --> 00:59:36,968
...as you are divine...

553
00:59:37,705 --> 00:59:39,332
...O king of kings.

554
00:59:39,507 --> 00:59:43,409
Such an offer
only a madman would refuse.

555
00:59:44,011 --> 00:59:46,002
But the....

556
00:59:46,914 --> 00:59:49,747
The idea of kneeling, it's....

557
00:59:49,917 --> 00:59:54,445
You see, slaughtering
all those men of yours has....

558
00:59:54,622 --> 00:59:58,456
Well, it's left a nasty cramp in my leg...

559
00:59:58,626 --> 01:00:00,719
...so kneeling will be hard for me.

560
01:00:00,995 --> 01:00:04,362
There will be no glory in your sacrifice.

561
01:00:04,532 --> 01:00:08,127
I will erase even the memory of Sparta
from the histories.

562
01:00:08,302 --> 01:00:11,499
Every piece of Greek parchment
shall be burned.

563
01:00:11,672 --> 01:00:15,005
Every Greek historian and every scribe
shall have their eyes put out...

564
01:00:15,176 --> 01:00:17,440
...and their tongues
cut from their mouths.

565
01:00:17,611 --> 01:00:23,607
Why, uttering the very name of Sparta
or Leonidas will be punishable by death.

566
01:00:24,251 --> 01:00:27,516
The world will never know
you existed at all.

567
01:00:29,657 --> 01:00:34,253
The world will know
that free men stood against a tyrant.

568
01:00:34,462 --> 01:00:37,954
That few stood against many.

569
01:00:38,365 --> 01:00:41,493
And before this battle was over...

570
01:00:41,769 --> 01:00:44,738
...that even a god-king can bleed.

571
01:00:52,113 --> 01:00:54,308
You fought well today...

572
01:00:55,649 --> 01:00:57,549
...for a woman.

573
01:00:58,719 --> 01:01:00,380
As did you.

574
01:01:00,554 --> 01:01:03,648
Maybe if I'm injured,
you'll be able to keep up with me.

575
01:01:04,158 --> 01:01:09,118
Perhaps I was so far ahead
you couldn't see me.

576
01:01:09,730 --> 01:01:12,927
More likely offering your backside
to the Thespians.

577
01:01:13,868 --> 01:01:15,495
Jealousy...

578
01:01:15,669 --> 01:01:18,160
...does not become you, my friend.

579
01:01:20,908 --> 01:01:23,240
Move it, men!

580
01:01:25,346 --> 01:01:27,576
Pile those Persians high.

581
01:01:30,718 --> 01:01:33,516
For unless I miss my guess...

582
01:01:34,088 --> 01:01:37,080
...we're in for one wild night.

583
01:02:01,015 --> 01:02:06,180
They have served the dark will
of Persian kings for 500 years.

584
01:02:06,353 --> 01:02:08,685
Eyes as dark as night.

585
01:02:08,856 --> 01:02:10,847
Teeth filed to fangs.

586
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:15,224
Soulless.

587
01:02:22,636 --> 01:02:27,403
The personal guard to King Xerxes himself.
The Persian warrior elite.

588
01:02:29,210 --> 01:02:32,304
The deadliest fighting force
in all of Asia:

589
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:35,139
The Immortals.

590
01:02:43,357 --> 01:02:46,758
The god-king
has betrayed a fatal flaw:

591
01:02:47,261 --> 01:02:49,024
Hubris.

592
01:02:51,265 --> 01:02:54,029
Easy to taunt, easy to trick.

593
01:02:54,702 --> 01:02:57,136
Before wounds and weariness
have taken their toll...

594
01:02:57,304 --> 01:03:00,831
...the mad king
throws the best he has at us.

595
01:03:01,342 --> 01:03:03,037
Xerxes has taken the bait.

596
01:03:03,210 --> 01:03:05,007
Spartans, push!

597
01:03:15,689 --> 01:03:17,281
Immortals.

598
01:03:17,758 --> 01:03:20,727
We put their name to the test.

599
01:04:04,905 --> 01:04:06,338
Father!

600
01:05:52,012 --> 01:05:53,274
My king!

601
01:07:06,053 --> 01:07:08,021
Arcadians, now!

602
01:07:10,324 --> 01:07:13,088
Go! Show the Spartans what we can do.

603
01:07:13,694 --> 01:07:15,127
Go!

604
01:07:24,538 --> 01:07:26,438
They shout and curse...

605
01:07:26,607 --> 01:07:29,804
...stabbing wildly,
more brawlers than warriors.

606
01:07:30,944 --> 01:07:33,504
They make a wondrous
mess of things.

607
01:07:34,548 --> 01:07:37,312
Brave amateurs, they do their part.

608
01:08:24,932 --> 01:08:26,797
Immortals.

609
01:08:26,967 --> 01:08:29,561
They fail our king's test.

610
01:08:29,736 --> 01:08:32,671
And a man
who fancies himself a god...

611
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:38,344
...feels a very human chill
crawl up his spine.

612
01:08:45,452 --> 01:08:47,579
To our king!

613
01:08:47,955 --> 01:08:49,946
And our honored dead.

614
01:08:50,123 --> 01:08:52,921
Whom will Xerxes dare to send next?
Whom?!

615
01:08:53,260 --> 01:08:55,956
There's nothing that can stop us now!

616
01:08:56,830 --> 01:09:00,357
Even the king allows himself
to hope for more than glory.

617
01:09:00,534 --> 01:09:03,867
Such mad hope, but there it is:

618
01:09:04,304 --> 01:09:09,708
"Against Asia's endless hordes,
against all odds, we can do it.

619
01:09:09,876 --> 01:09:12,606
We can hold the Hot Gates.

620
01:09:12,779 --> 01:09:14,906
We can win."

621
01:09:22,489 --> 01:09:24,252
Dawn.

622
01:09:24,858 --> 01:09:28,885
Whips crack. Barbarians howl.

623
01:09:29,062 --> 01:09:32,964
Those behind cry, "Forward!"

624
01:09:34,835 --> 01:09:38,635
Those in front cry, "Back!"

625
01:09:44,745 --> 01:09:47,270
Our eyes bear witness
to the grotesque spectacle...

626
01:09:47,447 --> 01:09:51,543
...coughed forth from the darkest
corner of Xerxes' empire.

627
01:10:41,768 --> 01:10:43,292
When muscle failed...

628
01:10:43,737 --> 01:10:46,399
...they turned to their magic.

629
01:10:47,441 --> 01:10:52,242
One hundred nations descend
upon us, the armies of all Asia.

630
01:10:52,412 --> 01:10:56,872
Funneled into this narrow corridor,
their numbers count for nothing.

631
01:11:31,251 --> 01:11:33,219
They fall by the hundreds.

632
01:11:33,386 --> 01:11:38,983
We send the severed bodies and the
fragile hearts back to Xerxes' feet.

633
01:11:55,609 --> 01:11:59,773
King Xerxes is displeased
with his generals.

634
01:11:59,946 --> 01:12:02,506
He disciplines them.

635
01:12:19,399 --> 01:12:23,802
Xerxes dispatches his monsters
from half the world away.

636
01:12:34,781 --> 01:12:36,874
They're clumsy beasts...

637
01:12:37,050 --> 01:12:39,416
...and the piled Persian dead
are slippery.

638
01:13:15,856 --> 01:13:18,290
- You still here?
- Somebody's gotta watch your back.

639
01:13:18,458 --> 01:13:20,050
Not now, I'm a little busy.

640
01:14:00,333 --> 01:14:02,858
Regroup!

641
01:14:06,072 --> 01:14:07,699
Astinos!

642
01:14:07,908 --> 01:14:09,603
My son!

643
01:14:18,551 --> 01:14:20,178
Astinos!

644
01:14:20,353 --> 01:14:23,117
No!

645
01:14:46,379 --> 01:14:48,506
Day wears on.

646
01:14:48,848 --> 01:14:51,009
We lose few...

647
01:14:51,184 --> 01:14:54,415
...but each felled is a friend,
or dearest blood.

648
01:14:56,623 --> 01:15:00,525
And upon seeing the headless body
of his own young son...

649
01:15:00,694 --> 01:15:02,559
...the captain breaks rank.

650
01:15:02,729 --> 01:15:06,165
He goes wild, blood-drunk.

651
01:15:30,790 --> 01:15:33,281
The captain's cries of pain
at the loss of his son...

652
01:15:33,460 --> 01:15:37,191
...are more frightening to the enemy
than the deepest battle drums.

653
01:15:37,364 --> 01:15:41,357
It takes three men to restrain him
and bring him back to our own.

654
01:15:41,701 --> 01:15:44,033
The day is ours.

655
01:15:44,437 --> 01:15:47,099
No songs are sung.

656
01:16:27,213 --> 01:16:31,809
Your gods were cruel to shape you so,
friend Ephialtes.

657
01:16:34,220 --> 01:16:35,517
The Spartans, too...

658
01:16:36,256 --> 01:16:39,157
...were cruel to reject you.

659
01:16:41,995 --> 01:16:44,429
But I am kind.

660
01:16:50,937 --> 01:16:53,064
Everything you could ever desire...

661
01:16:54,307 --> 01:16:56,070
...every happiness you can imagine...

662
01:16:58,278 --> 01:17:02,874
...every pleasure your fellow Greeks
and your false gods have denied you...

663
01:17:03,683 --> 01:17:05,947
...I will grant you.

664
01:17:07,220 --> 01:17:09,620
For I am kind.

665
01:17:23,570 --> 01:17:26,869
Embrace me as your king
and as your god.

666
01:17:28,007 --> 01:17:29,702
Yes.

667
01:17:31,177 --> 01:17:35,978
Lead my soldiers to the hidden path
that enters behind the cursed Spartans...

668
01:17:36,149 --> 01:17:38,413
...and your joys will be endless.

669
01:17:46,860 --> 01:17:50,023
Yes! I want it all.

670
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:54,024
Wealth. Women.

671
01:17:56,035 --> 01:17:57,730
And one more thing...

672
01:18:00,907 --> 01:18:03,569
...I want a uniform.

673
01:18:08,081 --> 01:18:09,776
Done.

674
01:18:11,417 --> 01:18:13,112
You will find...

675
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:15,654
...I am kind.

676
01:18:16,789 --> 01:18:21,021
Unlike the cruel Leonidas,
who demanded that you stand...

677
01:18:23,129 --> 01:18:24,824
...I require only...

678
01:18:25,565 --> 01:18:26,998
...that you kneel.

679
01:18:54,661 --> 01:18:56,595
Beautiful night.

680
01:18:58,031 --> 01:19:02,024
Yes, but I did not ask you here
for small talk, Theron.

681
01:19:02,669 --> 01:19:04,762
You can be sure of that.

682
01:19:06,172 --> 01:19:08,834
You never spared words with me.

683
01:19:09,409 --> 01:19:12,674
Can I offer you something?
A drink, perhaps?

684
01:19:12,845 --> 01:19:14,676
Is it poison?

685
01:19:15,081 --> 01:19:17,845
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
it's only water.

686
01:19:27,627 --> 01:19:30,790
I'm told it's been arranged for you
to go before the council.

687
01:19:31,464 --> 01:19:33,193
Yes.

688
01:19:33,399 --> 01:19:36,732
I need your help in winning votes
to send the army north to our king.

689
01:19:37,303 --> 01:19:38,930
Yes.

690
01:19:39,606 --> 01:19:42,166
I can see it,
the two of us standing together.

691
01:19:42,342 --> 01:19:46,711
Me, politician. You, warrior.
Our voices as one.

692
01:19:48,047 --> 01:19:49,514
But why would I want to do that?

693
01:19:50,483 --> 01:19:54,442
It proves you care for a king who right now
fights for the very water we drink.

694
01:19:54,787 --> 01:19:56,379
True.

695
01:19:56,756 --> 01:19:59,384
But this is politics, not war.

696
01:19:59,692 --> 01:20:01,216
Leonidas is an idealist.

697
01:20:01,628 --> 01:20:05,564
I know your kind too well. You send men
to slaughter for your own gain.

698
01:20:05,732 --> 01:20:10,635
Your husband, our king,
has taken 300 of our finest to slaughter.

699
01:20:10,803 --> 01:20:15,433
He's broken our laws
and left without the council's consent.

700
01:20:15,942 --> 01:20:18,934
- I'm simply a realist.
- You're an opportunist.

701
01:20:19,912 --> 01:20:24,212
You're as foolish as Leonidas if you think
men don't have a price in this world.

702
01:20:24,384 --> 01:20:28,946
All men are not created equal.
That's the Spartan code, my little queen.

703
01:20:32,625 --> 01:20:35,025
I admire your passion.

704
01:20:36,362 --> 01:20:38,091
But don't think that you...

705
01:20:38,531 --> 01:20:40,863
...a woman, even a queen...

706
01:20:41,034 --> 01:20:44,970
...can walk into the council chamber
and sway the minds of men.

707
01:20:45,138 --> 01:20:47,572
I own that chamber...

708
01:20:47,740 --> 01:20:49,799
...as if it were built with these hands.

709
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:57,807
I could crush
the life out of you right now.

710
01:20:58,885 --> 01:21:02,548
You will go before the council,
but your words will fall on deaf ears.

711
01:21:02,722 --> 01:21:08,490
Leonidas will receive no reinforcements,
and if he returns, without my help...

712
01:21:08,661 --> 01:21:11,630
...he will go to jail or worse.

713
01:21:15,368 --> 01:21:16,835
Do you love your Sparta?

714
01:21:17,337 --> 01:21:19,032
Yes.

715
01:21:19,205 --> 01:21:21,469
- And your king?
- I do.

716
01:21:27,313 --> 01:21:31,010
Your husband fights for his land
and his love.

717
01:21:31,684 --> 01:21:33,982
What do you have to offer...

718
01:21:34,754 --> 01:21:37,723
...in return for my word
that I'll help you send our army north?

719
01:21:41,694 --> 01:21:44,356
What does a realist want with his queen?

720
01:21:48,968 --> 01:21:50,697
I think you know.

721
01:22:05,151 --> 01:22:07,847
This will not be over quickly.

722
01:22:08,888 --> 01:22:11,379
You will not enjoy this.

723
01:22:11,924 --> 01:22:14,188
I'm not your king.

724
01:22:38,985 --> 01:22:40,782
Dilios.

725
01:22:42,789 --> 01:22:46,816
I trust that scratch
hasn't made you useless?

726
01:22:46,993 --> 01:22:50,019
Hardly, my lord. It's just an eye.

727
01:22:50,196 --> 01:22:53,393
The gods saw fit to grace me
with a spare.

728
01:22:55,268 --> 01:22:57,202
My captain?

729
01:22:58,504 --> 01:23:02,304
Curses the gods and mourns alone.

730
01:23:04,277 --> 01:23:06,245
Leonidas!

731
01:23:07,447 --> 01:23:10,439
We are undone.
Undone, I tell you. Destroyed.

732
01:23:10,616 --> 01:23:12,049
Daxos, calm yourself.

733
01:23:12,218 --> 01:23:15,813
Our hunchback traitor led Xerxes' Immortals
to the hidden goat path behind us.

734
01:23:16,222 --> 01:23:19,055
The Phocians you posted there
were scattered without a fight.

735
01:23:19,225 --> 01:23:24,458
- This battle is over, Leonidas.
- This battle is over when I say it is over.

736
01:23:24,630 --> 01:23:28,999
By morning, the Immortals will surround us.
The Hot Gates will fall.

737
01:23:29,635 --> 01:23:34,004
Spartans! Prepare for glory!

738
01:23:34,173 --> 01:23:37,370
Glory? Have you gone mad?

739
01:23:37,543 --> 01:23:39,101
There is no glory to be had now.

740
01:23:39,712 --> 01:23:43,307
Only retreat or surrender. Or death.

741
01:23:43,483 --> 01:23:46,646
Well, that's an easy choice
for us, Arcadian.

742
01:23:46,819 --> 01:23:52,314
Spartans never retreat.
Spartans never surrender.

743
01:23:52,925 --> 01:23:55,018
Go spread the word.

744
01:23:55,261 --> 01:23:58,924
Let every Greek assembled
know the truth of this.

745
01:23:59,098 --> 01:24:01,931
Let each among them
search his own soul.

746
01:24:03,636 --> 01:24:07,766
And while you're at it, search your own.

747
01:24:15,281 --> 01:24:17,545
My men will leave with me.

748
01:24:22,889 --> 01:24:25,119
Godspeed, Leonidas.

749
01:24:31,430 --> 01:24:33,022
Children!

750
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,331
Children.

751
01:24:36,369 --> 01:24:38,360
Gather round.

752
01:24:40,239 --> 01:24:43,504
No retreat, no surrender.

753
01:24:43,676 --> 01:24:47,544
That is Spartan law.

754
01:24:47,780 --> 01:24:52,843
And by Spartan law,
we will stand and fight...

755
01:24:53,019 --> 01:24:55,010
...and die.

756
01:24:58,457 --> 01:25:01,949
A new age has begun.

757
01:25:03,696 --> 01:25:06,824
An age of freedom.

758
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:11,563
And all will know that 300 Spartans...

759
01:25:11,737 --> 01:25:15,002
...gave their last breath to defend it.

760
01:25:35,294 --> 01:25:37,057
My friend.

761
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:46,163
I have lived my entire life
without regret until now.

762
01:25:49,542 --> 01:25:55,481
It's not that my son
gave up his life for his country.

763
01:25:57,383 --> 01:26:01,251
It's just that I never told him
that I loved him the most.

764
01:26:02,855 --> 01:26:05,722
That he stood by me with honor.

765
01:26:07,159 --> 01:26:10,094
That he was all that was best in me.

766
01:26:19,205 --> 01:26:21,730
My heart is broken for your loss.

767
01:26:22,475 --> 01:26:24,170
Heart?

768
01:26:29,248 --> 01:26:32,342
I have filled my heart...

769
01:26:32,518 --> 01:26:34,247
...with hate.

770
01:26:38,391 --> 01:26:40,052
Good.

771
01:26:49,201 --> 01:26:51,032
Dilios...

772
01:26:52,738 --> 01:26:54,865
...let's take a walk.

773
01:26:56,342 --> 01:26:58,401
Yes, my lord.

774
01:27:00,813 --> 01:27:03,475
But, sire, I am fit and ready for battle.

775
01:27:03,649 --> 01:27:06,777
That you are, one of the finest.

776
01:27:07,086 --> 01:27:10,681
But you have another talent
unlike any other Spartan.

777
01:27:13,392 --> 01:27:16,828
You will deliver my final orders
to the council...

778
01:27:16,996 --> 01:27:19,487
...with force and verve.

779
01:27:22,001 --> 01:27:24,265
Tell them our story.

780
01:27:24,437 --> 01:27:28,965
Make every Greek know
what happened here.

781
01:27:29,809 --> 01:27:32,437
You'll have a grand tale to tell.

782
01:27:34,246 --> 01:27:35,941
A tale of victory.

783
01:27:36,615 --> 01:27:38,173
Victory.

784
01:27:42,221 --> 01:27:44,212
Yes, my lord.

785
01:27:49,895 --> 01:27:52,261
Sire, any message...?

786
01:27:55,134 --> 01:27:56,499
For the queen?

787
01:28:18,958 --> 01:28:21,392
None that need be spoken.

788
01:28:36,509 --> 01:28:38,909
Hundreds leave.

789
01:28:39,545 --> 01:28:41,979
A handful stay.

790
01:28:47,153 --> 01:28:49,781
Only one looks back.

791
01:29:00,099 --> 01:29:02,294
Spartans!

792
01:29:03,369 --> 01:29:06,532
Ready your breakfast and eat hearty...

793
01:29:06,705 --> 01:29:10,641
...for tonight we dine in hell!

794
01:29:19,518 --> 01:29:22,180
May I give the floor now...

795
01:29:22,354 --> 01:29:26,791
...to the wife of Leonidas
and queen of Sparta.

796
01:29:38,504 --> 01:29:40,233
- What's this?
- This is nothing.

797
01:29:40,406 --> 01:29:42,237
Councilmen...

798
01:29:42,408 --> 01:29:46,174
...I stand before you
not only as your queen.

799
01:29:47,046 --> 01:29:49,776
I come to you as a mother.

800
01:29:51,050 --> 01:29:53,450
I come to you as a wife.

801
01:29:55,254 --> 01:29:57,779
I come to you as a Spartan woman.

802
01:30:02,795 --> 01:30:05,889
I come to you with great humility.

803
01:30:09,335 --> 01:30:11,735
I am not here to represent Leonidas.

804
01:30:11,904 --> 01:30:14,668
His actions speak louder
than my words ever could.

805
01:30:15,007 --> 01:30:17,407
I am here for all those voices
which cannot be heard.

806
01:30:17,576 --> 01:30:20,101
Mothers, daughters, fathers, sons.

807
01:30:20,279 --> 01:30:23,248
Three hundred families
that bleed for our rights...

808
01:30:23,682 --> 01:30:26,879
...and for the very principles
this room was built upon.

809
01:30:27,486 --> 01:30:29,579
We are at war, gentlemen.

810
01:30:30,022 --> 01:30:32,547
We must send the entire Spartan army
to aid our king...

811
01:30:32,725 --> 01:30:35,819
...in the preservation of not
just ourselves, but of our children.

812
01:30:36,395 --> 01:30:39,523
Send the army
for the preservation of liberty.

813
01:30:39,698 --> 01:30:42,030
Send it for justice.

814
01:30:42,201 --> 01:30:43,828
Send it for law and order.

815
01:30:44,370 --> 01:30:46,565
Send it for reason.

816
01:30:46,739 --> 01:30:50,835
But most importantly,
send our army for hope.

817
01:30:51,010 --> 01:30:54,571
Hope that a king and his men have not
been wasted to the pages of history.

818
01:30:55,414 --> 01:30:58,850
That their courage bonds us together.

819
01:30:59,151 --> 01:31:02,348
That we are made stronger
by their actions...

820
01:31:03,355 --> 01:31:07,451
...and that your choices today
reflect their bravery.

821
01:31:09,395 --> 01:31:11,056
Three hundred.

822
01:31:13,399 --> 01:31:15,230
We must send them.

823
01:31:19,004 --> 01:31:20,835
Moving...

824
01:31:21,173 --> 01:31:24,074
...eloquent, passionate.

825
01:31:24,476 --> 01:31:28,640
But it doesn't change the fact
that your husband has brought war upon us.

826
01:31:28,814 --> 01:31:31,248
You are wrong.
Xerxes brought it forth...

827
01:31:31,417 --> 01:31:33,885
...and before that,
his father Darius at Marathon.

828
01:31:34,053 --> 01:31:35,782
The Persians will not stop...

829
01:31:35,955 --> 01:31:39,322
...until the only shelter we will find
is rubble and chaos.

830
01:31:39,725 --> 01:31:43,456
This chamber needs no
history lesson, my queen.

831
01:31:43,963 --> 01:31:46,158
Then what is the lesson
you would like to leave?

832
01:31:46,332 --> 01:31:48,425
Shall I begin to enumerate all of them?

833
01:31:48,834 --> 01:31:52,270
Honor. Duty. Glory.

834
01:31:52,538 --> 01:31:57,566
You speak of honor, duty and glory?

835
01:31:58,877 --> 01:32:00,105
But what of adultery?

836
01:32:00,279 --> 01:32:02,747
- How dare you.
- How dare I?

837
01:32:03,182 --> 01:32:06,174
Watch her carefully.

838
01:32:06,352 --> 01:32:09,321
She is a trickster in true form.

839
01:32:09,488 --> 01:32:12,651
Do not play with the members
of this sacred chamber, my queen.

840
01:32:12,825 --> 01:32:15,919
Just hours ago,
you offered yourself to me.

841
01:32:16,095 --> 01:32:20,532
Were I a weaker man,
I would have her scent on me still.

842
01:32:20,699 --> 01:32:23,691
- This is outrage.
- Oh, the hypocrite speaks!

843
01:32:23,869 --> 01:32:26,861
Did you not receive a similar payment,
which you took...

844
01:32:27,039 --> 01:32:30,270
...in exchange for her having an audience
with these noble men?

845
01:32:30,442 --> 01:32:32,205
- That is a lie.
- Is it?

846
01:32:32,378 --> 01:32:36,144
Was he not, by your invitation,
asked to come to the king's bedchamber?

847
01:32:36,682 --> 01:32:41,312
The very bed where you attempted
to negotiate with me so vigorously?

848
01:32:43,956 --> 01:32:47,414
You look shocked.
A bribe of the flesh, gentlemen...

849
01:32:47,593 --> 01:32:50,892
...while her husband
promotes anarchy and war.

850
01:32:53,832 --> 01:32:55,026
He speaks truth.

851
01:32:55,634 --> 01:32:58,831
Words escape
even the most cunning tongue...

852
01:32:59,004 --> 01:33:01,063
...my little whore queen.

853
01:33:05,811 --> 01:33:07,642
What queen-like behavior.

854
01:33:09,348 --> 01:33:12,476
Remove her from this chamber
before she infects us further...

855
01:33:12,651 --> 01:33:15,643
...with her inglorious and shabby self.

856
01:33:22,461 --> 01:33:24,053
This will not be over quickly.

857
01:33:25,397 --> 01:33:28,924
You will not enjoy this.
I am not your queen.

858
01:33:51,090 --> 01:33:53,024
Traitor.

859
01:33:53,559 --> 01:33:58,360
Traitor! Traitor! Traitor!

860
01:33:58,630 --> 01:34:00,894
Traitor!

861
01:34:37,936 --> 01:34:43,932
Leonidas, my compliments
and congratulations.

862
01:34:44,109 --> 01:34:47,772
You surely have turned calamity
into victory.

863
01:34:47,946 --> 01:34:50,938
Despite your insufferable arrogance...

864
01:34:51,116 --> 01:34:55,280
...the god-king has come to admire
Spartan valor and fighting skill.

865
01:34:56,021 --> 01:34:57,386
You will make a mighty ally.

866
01:34:57,556 --> 01:34:59,285
Yield, Leonidas.

867
01:35:00,459 --> 01:35:03,326
Use your reason. Think of your men.

868
01:35:06,165 --> 01:35:07,792
I beg you.

869
01:35:08,367 --> 01:35:10,335
Listen to your fellow Greek.

870
01:35:10,502 --> 01:35:14,199
He can attest
to the divine one's generosity.

871
01:35:14,373 --> 01:35:18,833
Despite your several insults,
despite your horrid blasphemies...

872
01:35:19,745 --> 01:35:22,942
...the lord of hosts
is prepared to forgive all...

873
01:35:23,182 --> 01:35:26,208
...and more, to reward your service.

874
01:35:26,485 --> 01:35:27,816
You fight for your lands.

875
01:35:28,520 --> 01:35:30,351
Keep them.

876
01:35:31,056 --> 01:35:33,024
You fight for Sparta.

877
01:35:33,192 --> 01:35:37,185
She will be wealthier and more powerful
than ever before.

878
01:35:37,396 --> 01:35:39,330
You fight for your kingship.

879
01:35:40,232 --> 01:35:43,201
You will be proclaimed warlord
of all Greece...

880
01:35:43,368 --> 01:35:47,668
...answerable only
to the one true master of the world.

881
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:52,773
Leonidas, your victory will be complete...

882
01:35:52,945 --> 01:35:55,539
...if you but lay down your arms...

883
01:35:55,714 --> 01:35:58,877
...and kneel to holy Xerxes.

884
01:36:29,381 --> 01:36:34,318
It's been more than 30 years
since the wolf in the winter cold.

885
01:36:34,486 --> 01:36:39,048
And now, as then,
it's not fear that grips him...

886
01:36:39,224 --> 01:36:44,389
...only restlessness.
A heightened sense of things.

887
01:36:45,163 --> 01:36:49,964
The seaborne breeze coolly kissing
the sweat at his chest and neck.

888
01:36:50,135 --> 01:36:51,625
Gulls cawing...

889
01:36:51,803 --> 01:36:56,035
...complaining even as they feast
on the thousands of floating dead.

890
01:36:57,643 --> 01:37:02,706
The steady breathing
of the 300 at his back...

891
01:37:03,482 --> 01:37:06,940
...ready to die for him
without a moment's pause.

892
01:37:09,554 --> 01:37:10,919
Every one of them...

893
01:37:12,391 --> 01:37:14,325
...ready to die.

894
01:37:29,841 --> 01:37:32,776
His helmet is stifling.

895
01:37:53,465 --> 01:37:56,298
His shield is heavy.

896
01:38:03,909 --> 01:38:05,274
Your spear.

897
01:38:14,086 --> 01:38:15,519
You there...

898
01:38:15,954 --> 01:38:17,945
...Ephialtes.

899
01:38:23,061 --> 01:38:25,325
May you live forever.

900
01:38:32,738 --> 01:38:35,036
Leonidas, your spear.

901
01:39:42,274 --> 01:39:43,866
Stelios!

902
01:39:53,885 --> 01:39:55,477
Slaughter them!

903
01:39:58,857 --> 01:40:00,449
His helmet was stifling.

904
01:40:00,625 --> 01:40:03,753
It narrowed his vision,
and he must see far.

905
01:40:05,063 --> 01:40:08,931
His shield was heavy.
It threw him off balance...

906
01:40:09,100 --> 01:40:12,763
...and his target is far away.

907
01:41:17,335 --> 01:41:21,897
The old ones say we Spartans are
descended from Hercules himself.

908
01:41:23,375 --> 01:41:27,709
Bold Leonidas gives testament
to our bloodline.

909
01:41:27,879 --> 01:41:32,009
His roar is long and loud.

910
01:42:02,113 --> 01:42:03,705
My king.

911
01:42:15,961 --> 01:42:19,590
It's an honor to die at your side.

912
01:42:21,166 --> 01:42:25,660
It's an honor to have lived at yours.

913
01:42:46,591 --> 01:42:48,684
My queen!

914
01:42:56,935 --> 01:42:58,664
My wife.

915
01:43:10,115 --> 01:43:11,912
My love.

916
01:45:38,329 --> 01:45:40,456
"Remember us."

917
01:45:42,133 --> 01:45:45,569
As simple an order
as a king can give.

918
01:45:47,138 --> 01:45:50,335
"Remember why we died."

919
01:45:52,343 --> 01:45:56,370
For he did not wish tribute or song...

920
01:45:58,216 --> 01:46:02,414
...nor monuments,
nor poems of war and valor.

921
01:46:05,290 --> 01:46:07,588
His wish was simple.

922
01:46:12,964 --> 01:46:15,023
"Remember us"...

923
01:46:16,067 --> 01:46:17,796
...he said to me.

924
01:46:19,470 --> 01:46:21,665
That was his hope.

925
01:46:21,873 --> 01:46:25,604
Should any free soul
come across that place...

926
01:46:26,377 --> 01:46:29,710
...in all the countless
centuries yet to be...

927
01:46:30,148 --> 01:46:32,708
...may all our voices...

928
01:46:32,884 --> 01:46:36,945
...whisper to you
from the ageless stones.

929
01:46:37,922 --> 01:46:41,551
Go tell the Spartans, passerby...

930
01:46:41,893 --> 01:46:47,763
...that here, by Spartan law,
we lie.

931
01:46:50,535 --> 01:46:53,231
And so my king died...

932
01:46:54,105 --> 01:46:56,733
...and my brothers died...

933
01:46:59,110 --> 01:47:01,578
...barely a year ago.

934
01:47:05,516 --> 01:47:10,749
Long I pondered my king's
cryptic talk of victory.

935
01:47:10,989 --> 01:47:13,617
Time has proven him wise.

936
01:47:14,525 --> 01:47:17,551
For from free Greek to free Greek...

937
01:47:17,729 --> 01:47:22,325
...the word was spread
that bold Leonidas and his 300...

938
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:24,491
...so far from home...

939
01:47:24,669 --> 01:47:28,070
...laid down their lives
not just for Sparta...

940
01:47:28,239 --> 01:47:32,039
...but for all Greece
and the promise this country holds.

941
01:47:32,944 --> 01:47:38,007
Now, here on this rugged patch of earth
called Plataea...

942
01:47:38,182 --> 01:47:43,176
...Xerxes' hordes face obliteration!

943
01:47:44,856 --> 01:47:48,257
Just there the barbarians huddle...

944
01:47:48,426 --> 01:47:53,295
...sheer terror gripping tight
their hearts...

945
01:47:53,464 --> 01:47:55,364
...with icy fingers...

946
01:47:55,533 --> 01:47:58,764
...knowing full well
what merciless horrors they suffered...

947
01:47:58,937 --> 01:48:01,462
...at the swords and spears of 300.

948
01:48:02,874 --> 01:48:08,437
Yet they stare now across the plain
at 10,000 Spartans...

949
01:48:08,613 --> 01:48:11,912
...commanding 30,000 free Greeks!

950
01:48:18,723 --> 01:48:22,625
The enemy outnumber us
a paltry three to one.

951
01:48:22,927 --> 01:48:24,918
Good odds for any Greek.

952
01:48:25,630 --> 01:48:30,329
This day, we rescue a world
from mysticism and tyranny...

953
01:48:30,501 --> 01:48:34,870
...and usher in a future
brighter than anything we can imagine.

954
01:48:39,310 --> 01:48:40,800
Give thanks, men...

955
01:48:41,512 --> 01:48:45,278
...to Leonidas and the brave 300!.

956
01:48:45,450 --> 01:48:48,180
To Victory!

957
01:56:27,577 --> 01:56:29,568
