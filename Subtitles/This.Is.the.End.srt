2
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,320
Hey, Seth Rogen.
What up, man?

3
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:10,127
Oh, hey, John!
Over here!

4
00:01:10,211 --> 00:01:13,089
Welcome to Los Angeles
International Airport.

5
00:01:13,171 --> 00:01:14,968
Attention, all passengers.

6
00:01:15,051 --> 00:01:16,962
Do not leave your
baggage unattended.

7
00:01:17,051 --> 00:01:19,611
All unattended baggage
is subject to search...

8
00:01:19,691 --> 00:01:21,922
Yay!

9
00:01:22,012 --> 00:01:23,808
We're so happy!

10
00:01:23,891 --> 00:01:25,085
Look at this!

11
00:01:25,171 --> 00:01:26,445
What's happening, man?

12
00:01:26,531 --> 00:01:27,805
Good to see you, buddy.

13
00:01:27,891 --> 00:01:29,324
How you doing?
I'm good, man.

14
00:01:29,451 --> 00:01:30,440
Yes, you are.

15
00:01:31,131 --> 00:01:32,200
How long
has it been, man?

16
00:01:32,331 --> 00:01:33,447
Sometime in the last...

17
00:01:33,532 --> 00:01:35,488
Inside of a year or something.
Yeah.

18
00:01:35,572 --> 00:01:37,085
I have the best weekend
ever planned, man.

19
00:01:37,532 --> 00:01:39,682
Lay it on me. Ooh!
I don't want to ruin it.

20
00:01:39,972 --> 00:01:41,485
Seth Rogen!
Shit, here we go. Hey.

21
00:01:41,572 --> 00:01:42,925
How's it going, man?
Yeah, good.

22
00:01:43,052 --> 00:01:45,772
So, you, like, always play, like,
the same guy in every movie.

23
00:01:45,853 --> 00:01:47,571
When are you gonna do some,
like, real acting, man?

24
00:01:47,653 --> 00:01:48,642
Okay, thank you.

25
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,724
Give me something.
Give me, like, the laugh, man.

26
00:01:50,813 --> 00:01:52,132
Give me
the Seth Rogen laugh.

27
00:01:52,213 --> 00:01:54,602
Seth Rogen, everybody.

28
00:01:54,693 --> 00:01:57,970
All right, I've landed. I'm here.
We've said our hellos.

29
00:01:58,054 --> 00:02:01,046
Can we please go to
fucking Carl's Jr.?

30
00:02:01,494 --> 00:02:02,643
Oh.

31
00:02:02,734 --> 00:02:05,805
I would... I would love to.
I'm on a...

32
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:07,406
I can't really eat
that stuff right now.

33
00:02:07,533 --> 00:02:08,761
I'm on a, uh...
What?

34
00:02:08,853 --> 00:02:09,842
I'm on this cleanse.

35
00:02:09,934 --> 00:02:11,652
You're...
You're on a what?

36
00:02:11,734 --> 00:02:12,962
I'm on a cleanse.

37
00:02:15,054 --> 00:02:17,010
What?
It's good for you.

38
00:02:17,094 --> 00:02:18,732
I didn't know... You're supposed
to take six shits a day.

39
00:02:18,814 --> 00:02:20,247
That's not true.
It is true!

40
00:02:20,294 --> 00:02:21,807
You're supposed to shit
twice a day. No.

41
00:02:21,894 --> 00:02:23,533
That's not true.
That's what they used to think.

42
00:02:23,615 --> 00:02:25,890
Now they know you're supposed
to shit six times a day.

43
00:02:25,975 --> 00:02:28,535
So you're not drinking.
You're not smoking weed. You're not...

44
00:02:28,655 --> 00:02:31,408
No, no, I'm drinking
and smoking weed. But...

45
00:02:31,495 --> 00:02:33,167
I'm on a cleanse.
I'm not psychotic.

46
00:02:33,255 --> 00:02:35,008
Look, man, if you stopped
eating gluten,

47
00:02:35,096 --> 00:02:37,166
you'd feel way fucking
better all day.

48
00:02:37,256 --> 00:02:39,167
Whenever you feel shitty,
that's 'cause of gluten.

49
00:02:39,256 --> 00:02:40,371
That's not true.
It is.

50
00:02:40,496 --> 00:02:42,487
Who the fuck told you not
to eat gluten? It's just true.

51
00:02:42,576 --> 00:02:44,168
You don't even know
what gluten is.

52
00:02:44,256 --> 00:02:45,484
I know what fucking gluten is.

53
00:02:45,616 --> 00:02:46,810
No, you have no idea
what gluten is.

54
00:02:46,896 --> 00:02:47,886
I do know what gluten is.

55
00:02:47,977 --> 00:02:49,489
Gluten's a vague term.

56
00:02:49,576 --> 00:02:52,648
It's something that's used to categorize
things that are bad, you know?

57
00:02:52,736 --> 00:02:55,375
Calories, that's a gluten.
Fat, that's a gluten.

58
00:02:55,456 --> 00:02:58,493
Somebody just told you you
probably shouldn't eat gluten,

59
00:02:58,576 --> 00:03:00,249
you're like, "Oh, I guess
I shouldn't eat gluten. "

60
00:03:00,337 --> 00:03:02,487
Gluten means bad shit, man,
and I'm not eating it.

61
00:03:03,697 --> 00:03:05,016
Mmm!

62
00:03:05,297 --> 00:03:06,446
Mmm-hmm.
Oh!

63
00:03:06,537 --> 00:03:07,526
God!

64
00:03:07,817 --> 00:03:10,285
Each bite is better
than the previous bite.

65
00:03:10,377 --> 00:03:11,969
It is.
Gluten!

66
00:03:12,538 --> 00:03:13,687
Hey, this
looks beautiful.

67
00:03:13,778 --> 00:03:15,211
Yeah. Do you like it?
I totally redid it.

68
00:03:15,298 --> 00:03:16,287
It's fucking awesome.

69
00:03:16,378 --> 00:03:17,572
It's all new.
Those are new.

70
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:19,290
God damn, son!
It's pretty nice, huh?

71
00:03:19,338 --> 00:03:21,568
So this is how
the other half lives.

72
00:03:21,698 --> 00:03:23,370
Come on.
Amazing.

73
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:25,370
Air hockey tables.
Jesus Murphy!

74
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:27,017
Right? Okay,
get ready, Jay.

75
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:28,054
What?

76
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:29,174
I have a little
surprise for you.

77
00:03:29,259 --> 00:03:30,214
Okay.

78
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:32,573
Here's the best weekend
you ever had in your life. Oh!

79
00:03:34,098 --> 00:03:35,213
Look at it, man.

80
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,890
Oh, my...
Are you serious?

81
00:03:36,978 --> 00:03:38,094
It's all of your
favorite things.

82
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:41,575
Starburst and Airheads on a...
Yeah.

83
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:42,614
And it says "Jay. "

84
00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:44,417
In joints.
In joints.

85
00:03:44,499 --> 00:03:46,376
It says "Jay" in jays.

86
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:50,689
Seth Rogen, you are just
the best people.

87
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,169
Come on, I know you don't love it in LA,
so I figure I'll make it...

88
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,649
You know, I'll lube up
your entry a little bit.

89
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,731
It eases the transition.
Yeah, right?

90
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,418
This is the much-needed foreplay.

91
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,489
You know what else I got?

92
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,774
Yo, this...

93
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,294
A 3-D television.
No, you didn't...

94
00:04:03,381 --> 00:04:05,258
I got a 3-D TV.
Are you serious?

95
00:04:06,461 --> 00:04:08,736
Oh, my God.
I did it, man.

96
00:04:08,821 --> 00:04:10,049
What?

97
00:04:10,141 --> 00:04:11,620
Let's get into it.

98
00:04:11,701 --> 00:04:13,373
Oh, my God, bud.

99
00:04:13,501 --> 00:04:14,934
It's Gandalf the Grey's pipe.

100
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:16,249
Damn, no shit.

101
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,497
Hello, little hobbit.

102
00:04:18,581 --> 00:04:20,936
Spark my ganja.
Yeah.

103
00:04:23,341 --> 00:04:25,696
I'm a well-known
homosexual advocate.

104
00:04:25,781 --> 00:04:27,932
# Backstreet's back,
all right

105
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:36,378
# Hey, hey, yeah, well

106
00:04:36,822 --> 00:04:38,460
# Everybody
Rock your body

107
00:04:38,582 --> 00:04:41,017
# Everybody
# Everybody

108
00:04:41,103 --> 00:04:43,537
# Rock your body right
# Rock your body

109
00:04:43,623 --> 00:04:45,454
# Everybody!

110
00:04:45,543 --> 00:04:46,976
# Backstreet's back... #

111
00:04:47,063 --> 00:04:49,293
Oh, my eyes feel like
they're melting.

112
00:04:49,383 --> 00:04:50,452
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

113
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:51,982
I need a break.

114
00:04:52,784 --> 00:04:54,058
Oh. You know what, actually?

115
00:04:54,144 --> 00:04:55,975
We should go to
Franco's house soon.

116
00:04:56,064 --> 00:04:57,291
He's having a housewarming party.

117
00:04:57,423 --> 00:04:58,822
He just finished building his house.

118
00:04:58,903 --> 00:04:59,892
I haven't even seen it yet,

119
00:04:59,983 --> 00:05:01,814
but it's supposed
to be bonkers.

120
00:05:01,903 --> 00:05:03,097
I haven't been
in LA in, like, a year,

121
00:05:03,183 --> 00:05:06,460
and I came here
to chill with you.

122
00:05:06,544 --> 00:05:08,660
We can chill together, and we'll chill
with those other guys.

123
00:05:08,744 --> 00:05:10,655
We'll all chill
as one big unit.

124
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:12,143
Will I even know
anybody there?

125
00:05:12,224 --> 00:05:13,259
You know James Franco.

126
00:05:13,344 --> 00:05:15,653
James Franco doesn't even
know my name.

127
00:05:15,744 --> 00:05:16,938
Jonah Hill will be there.

128
00:05:17,024 --> 00:05:18,504
Can't stand him.
He can't stand me.

129
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:21,304
He's, like, the nicest guy in the world!
He likes you so much.

130
00:05:21,385 --> 00:05:23,182
He specifically talks
about how he likes you.

131
00:05:23,265 --> 00:05:24,414
Out of nowhere,
he just said, "You know what?

132
00:05:24,505 --> 00:05:25,540
"Jay's an inspiration. "

133
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:28,264
There's no way he said that.
Also, just can't stand him.

134
00:05:28,345 --> 00:05:29,938
Okay, fine.
Craig Robinson.

135
00:05:30,026 --> 00:05:31,015
Never met him.

136
00:05:31,106 --> 00:05:32,505
He's hilarious.

137
00:05:32,626 --> 00:05:34,662
Sweats a lot,
but he's a great guy.

138
00:05:34,746 --> 00:05:36,259
So it's gonna
be fun, man.

139
00:05:36,866 --> 00:05:39,743
For you, I will go.

140
00:05:39,825 --> 00:05:42,386
I promise, I'll stay
with you all night, okay?

141
00:05:42,466 --> 00:05:45,697
I won't ditch you. No, 'cause I
want to be with you all night.

142
00:05:45,786 --> 00:05:47,936
And you know why else?

143
00:05:48,026 --> 00:05:50,381
'Cause nobody puts
Jay in the corner.

144
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:02,901
Awesome.

145
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:03,942
Wow!

146
00:06:04,067 --> 00:06:05,659
Thank you. Thank you.
There you go. Cool.

147
00:06:05,787 --> 00:06:07,267
Thanks a lot, eh?
Thanks a lot.

148
00:06:07,348 --> 00:06:08,383
Okay, man.

149
00:06:08,948 --> 00:06:10,506
Holy shit.

150
00:06:11,228 --> 00:06:12,707
Wow!

151
00:06:13,668 --> 00:06:15,181
This is crazy!

152
00:06:15,268 --> 00:06:17,543
Yeah?
Yeah, man, right?

153
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:19,745
Look at it.
A bit much.

154
00:06:19,829 --> 00:06:21,262
I don't think
it is a bit much.

155
00:06:21,349 --> 00:06:22,576
I think it's right
on the money.

156
00:06:22,668 --> 00:06:24,181
What is he,
Pablo Escobar?

157
00:06:24,268 --> 00:06:25,542
Come on, man, this is an
awesome street.

158
00:06:25,628 --> 00:06:27,300
Channing Tatum
lives up there.

159
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:29,140
Oh, for the love of...
Will you stop talking about...

160
00:06:29,268 --> 00:06:30,337
This is the sexiest
street in America.

161
00:06:30,428 --> 00:06:31,543
You and
Channing Tatum.

162
00:06:31,628 --> 00:06:32,903
I think
he's attractive.

163
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,180
I think it's a cool house.
I know you do.

164
00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:37,782
I can't wait
to see inside it.

165
00:06:37,869 --> 00:06:39,461
That's why I'm excited.

166
00:06:39,549 --> 00:06:43,258
Ha-ha! Yes!
What's up, man? Seth!

167
00:06:43,349 --> 00:06:45,261
So happy you're here.
I'm so happy to be here.

168
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,578
Hey, Johnny,
what's up?

169
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,103
It's Jay.
It's Jay.

170
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:50,545
I'll never forget it again, man.
Good to see you.

171
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,348
Nice to see you.
Come on in. Yeah! Yeah, great.

172
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,660
Check it out.
My new place!

173
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,468
Awesome, man!

174
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:57,706
Designed it myself.

175
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,544
Really cool.
This place is beautiful, man.

176
00:07:00,631 --> 00:07:02,622
This place is
like a piece of me.

177
00:07:02,711 --> 00:07:04,781
You two just
stepped inside me.

178
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,944
You let us both
cum inside you. Yeah.

179
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,750
Icing on the cake.
Check it out.

180
00:07:11,511 --> 00:07:12,546
Painted them myself.

181
00:07:12,951 --> 00:07:13,940
Huh.

182
00:07:14,031 --> 00:07:15,942
Side by side.
A team.

183
00:07:16,031 --> 00:07:17,066
Holy shit.

184
00:07:17,551 --> 00:07:19,269
So, is it weird?

185
00:07:19,351 --> 00:07:21,307
No.
You sure?

186
00:07:21,391 --> 00:07:23,064
I really like it.

187
00:07:23,152 --> 00:07:24,267
What do you think, Jay?

188
00:07:24,352 --> 00:07:26,468
I'm not a big art guy.

189
00:07:26,552 --> 00:07:27,826
You don't like art?

190
00:07:27,912 --> 00:07:29,789
Well, come on...

191
00:07:29,872 --> 00:07:31,783
You play video games?
Yes.

192
00:07:31,872 --> 00:07:33,908
Well, guess what, buddy?
You like art.

193
00:07:33,992 --> 00:07:34,982
Yep.

194
00:07:35,073 --> 00:07:36,188
You ever been
to Subway?

195
00:07:36,273 --> 00:07:37,308
Yes.

196
00:07:37,393 --> 00:07:38,792
You order a sandwich?

197
00:07:38,873 --> 00:07:40,989
Somebody put that together
for you, dude. That's art.

198
00:07:41,073 --> 00:07:42,142
Sandwich artist.

199
00:07:42,233 --> 00:07:43,461
So, let me
lay this on you, Jay.

200
00:07:43,553 --> 00:07:44,542
Oh, fuck.

201
00:07:44,633 --> 00:07:45,827
Your mama's pussy
was the canvas.

202
00:07:45,913 --> 00:07:47,666
Your dad's dick
was the paintbrush.

203
00:07:47,754 --> 00:07:49,744
Boom.
You're the art. Huh?

204
00:07:50,673 --> 00:07:52,265
Thanks, James Franco.
You got it.

205
00:07:52,353 --> 00:07:53,832
Seth!
Mindy, hello.

206
00:07:53,913 --> 00:07:55,505
Oh, my God, great to see you.
Oh, you, too.

207
00:07:55,593 --> 00:07:56,821
Long time.
How's it going?

208
00:07:56,913 --> 00:07:59,188
You know Jay? I don't think
I've ever actually met you.

209
00:07:59,273 --> 00:08:00,912
You were so good in
Million Dollar Baby.

210
00:08:01,034 --> 00:08:03,025
That's amazing.
Thank you so much for saying that.

211
00:08:03,114 --> 00:08:05,025
Oh, my God, if I don't fuck
Michael Cera tonight,

212
00:08:05,154 --> 00:08:07,110
I'm gonna blow my brains out.
What?

213
00:08:07,194 --> 00:08:09,389
Fucking pale, 110 pounds,

214
00:08:09,474 --> 00:08:12,945
hairless, probably has a huge cock,
coked out of his mind...

215
00:08:13,035 --> 00:08:15,265
You can do a lot better.
That's just trouble.

216
00:08:15,355 --> 00:08:18,904
So, Ri-Ri, how about you,
you ever see a psychiatrist?

217
00:08:18,995 --> 00:08:20,189
Um...

218
00:08:23,635 --> 00:08:25,274
That's not cool.
Don't touch my butt, bitch.

219
00:08:25,436 --> 00:08:27,472
Michael, that's not cool.
Would you shut the fuck up, Jason!

220
00:08:27,556 --> 00:08:29,433
We're playing
a game, man.

221
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:31,672
Say cheese, baby.

222
00:08:33,035 --> 00:08:34,468
What's up, buddy?
How's it going, dude?

223
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:35,749
Good to see you, man.

224
00:08:35,835 --> 00:08:37,394
Is that Jay Baruchel?
Hi, there. Hey.

225
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:38,545
Oh, my God,
get in here, dude.

226
00:08:38,636 --> 00:08:40,228
How's it going, Jonah?
What are you doing?

227
00:08:40,316 --> 00:08:42,546
Good. How you doing, buddy?
Oh, my gosh.

228
00:08:42,636 --> 00:08:44,672
Welcome back.
Thank you very much.

229
00:08:44,756 --> 00:08:46,633
When'd you get in?
Uh, this morning,

230
00:08:46,716 --> 00:08:48,547
and boy,
are my arms tired.

231
00:08:50,157 --> 00:08:51,351
Dude, that's great.

232
00:08:51,437 --> 00:08:52,426
Thank you.
Sick.

233
00:08:52,517 --> 00:08:54,030
What have you guys
been doing?

234
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,948
Oh, we just
hung out all day.

235
00:08:56,037 --> 00:08:59,950
Ate a bunch of dirty burgers,
and smoked about a fucking pound of weed

236
00:09:00,037 --> 00:09:01,436
and played
a bunch of video games.

237
00:09:01,517 --> 00:09:03,748
Weed is tight. Weed is
tight. That's awesome.

238
00:09:03,838 --> 00:09:05,032
That's awesome.
Weed is awesome.

239
00:09:05,118 --> 00:09:07,473
It was like the golfing
sequence in Navy SEALs.

240
00:09:07,558 --> 00:09:09,594
Sick reference, though,
bro. Oh, thanks, bud.

241
00:09:09,678 --> 00:09:11,828
Dude, your references are out
of control. Everyone knows that.

242
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:13,510
Hey, thanks, man.
I'm jealous.

243
00:09:13,597 --> 00:09:15,873
I would have been there
in a heartbeat,

244
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:19,268
but, uh, I actually just
adopted this incontinent spaniel.

245
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:20,427
She's a really
beautiful soul.

246
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,156
Her name's Ahjhai.
Ahjhai?

247
00:09:22,238 --> 00:09:23,273
Yeah.
How do you spell it?

248
00:09:23,358 --> 00:09:24,871
A - H - J - H - A - I.

249
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:26,113
A - H...

250
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:27,154
You want to see
a picture of her?

251
00:09:27,239 --> 00:09:29,275
Oh, she's so sweet.
Hey!

252
00:09:29,359 --> 00:09:30,587
Look at her.
Aw!

253
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:32,351
She can't bark. She
doesn't know how, so...

254
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:33,508
She doesn't know
how to bark, even?

255
00:09:33,599 --> 00:09:34,588
She doesn't know
how to bark,

256
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:36,271
so I've tried
to teach her

257
00:09:36,359 --> 00:09:38,509
and she just kind of
screams, and so she was up,

258
00:09:38,599 --> 00:09:41,273
had her face smushed against
the cage, and was, like...

259
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,588
Ah!

260
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,879
Yeah, cool. Um...

261
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,835
Tell you what, boys,
I'm kind of jonesing,

262
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,276
so I'm gonna find someone I can bum
a smoke off of outside, all right?

263
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,119
That's tight, dude.
Honestly, I like you.

264
00:09:53,201 --> 00:09:54,190
Hey, likewise.

265
00:09:54,321 --> 00:09:55,720
Okay, dude, come back.

266
00:09:55,801 --> 00:09:58,633
I'll be right back. You're
holding court. All right, boys.

267
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,912
Dude. I know. I think
we're making some progress.

268
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,955
That was really good.

269
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,359
And honestly,
he's your old friend.

270
00:10:04,441 --> 00:10:05,794
We're your new friends.
He feels threatened.

271
00:10:05,881 --> 00:10:06,870
Yeah, man.

272
00:10:07,001 --> 00:10:08,639
You know,
and I get it.

273
00:10:08,721 --> 00:10:09,676
It's gonna be fine.

274
00:10:09,761 --> 00:10:11,114
I honestly think
tonight's the night

275
00:10:11,201 --> 00:10:12,350
we bust
this whole thing open.

276
00:10:12,441 --> 00:10:15,592
And I'm lucky. It's the
same thing a lot, though.

277
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:17,320
It's, like, my TV wife
opens the fridge,

278
00:10:17,402 --> 00:10:20,235
and is, like, "What happened
to the birthday cake?"

279
00:10:20,322 --> 00:10:22,995
And I come out with, like,
a little frosting, like,

280
00:10:23,082 --> 00:10:24,401
"What birthday cake?"

281
00:10:24,482 --> 00:10:26,074
'Cause you ate the cake! Yeah.

282
00:10:26,162 --> 00:10:27,356
'Cause you ate the cake!

283
00:10:27,442 --> 00:10:28,670
"It's my birthday. "

284
00:10:30,523 --> 00:10:33,083
That's why y'all number
one. 'Cause of that.

285
00:10:33,443 --> 00:10:34,478
You're Jay, right?
Yeah.

286
00:10:34,563 --> 00:10:35,552
Seth's boy?
Yeah.

287
00:10:35,643 --> 00:10:36,917
How you doing, man?
Good to see you.

288
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:38,072
Good.
Likewise, likewise.

289
00:10:38,123 --> 00:10:40,113
I'm Craig, man. This
is Emma. Hi. Hi, there.

290
00:10:40,442 --> 00:10:41,841
You just in town visiting him, or what?

291
00:10:41,923 --> 00:10:45,074
Yeah. Just for a little visit, you know.

292
00:10:45,163 --> 00:10:47,154
I try to not come down here very much.

293
00:10:47,243 --> 00:10:48,517
I don't really
love it here.

294
00:10:48,603 --> 00:10:49,558
You don't like LA?

295
00:10:49,643 --> 00:10:53,431
I'm just not really
into the LA lifestyle.

296
00:10:53,963 --> 00:10:55,238
What lifestyle
are you into?

297
00:10:55,324 --> 00:10:57,838
Look at him. He's,
like, a hipster, right?

298
00:10:57,924 --> 00:11:00,484
No, I'm not
a hipster, at all.

299
00:11:00,564 --> 00:11:03,158
Yeah, yeah, you do seem
to hate a lot of things,

300
00:11:03,244 --> 00:11:04,916
and the bottom of your
pants are awful tight.

301
00:11:05,004 --> 00:11:08,839
No, I just... I don't like Los
Angeles. It doesn't make me a hipster.

302
00:11:08,925 --> 00:11:11,155
I'll bet you hate movies
that are universally loved.

303
00:11:11,245 --> 00:11:12,234
I don't even...

304
00:11:12,325 --> 00:11:13,394
You like Forrest Gump?

305
00:11:13,485 --> 00:11:16,045
No, no, it's a horrendous piece of shit.

306
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,195
"Life is like a box
of chocolates," no?

307
00:11:18,325 --> 00:11:19,805
Yeah, no,
I'm familiar with it.

308
00:11:20,886 --> 00:11:23,080
"You never know
what you're gonna get. "

309
00:11:24,325 --> 00:11:26,998
Why don't we do a sequel
to Pineapple Express?

310
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:28,478
I would love to do
a sequel to Pineapple.

311
00:11:28,565 --> 00:11:29,554
Do you have
any ideas, or...

312
00:11:29,645 --> 00:11:31,237
I do have an idea.
What?

313
00:11:31,325 --> 00:11:34,523
It's that Red, Danny, has
become, like, the drug lord,

314
00:11:34,606 --> 00:11:36,562
you know, since we
killed the other one,

315
00:11:36,646 --> 00:11:38,716
and he wants to
assassinate Woody Harrelson,

316
00:11:38,846 --> 00:11:41,804
'cause he's gonna give a speech
that makes all of weed legal,

317
00:11:41,886 --> 00:11:44,241
effectively rendering
drug lords out of business.

318
00:11:44,367 --> 00:11:46,164
Awesome. Yeah, it's fucking awesome,

319
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,841
but we don't have... We don't
know how it should end yet.

320
00:11:48,927 --> 00:11:50,201
I... I know.

321
00:11:50,327 --> 00:11:52,921
Danny's trying to kill us. Yeah.

322
00:11:53,007 --> 00:11:55,601
And I sacrifice
myself for you.

323
00:11:55,687 --> 00:11:58,122
And he kills me,

324
00:11:58,208 --> 00:11:59,527
and I die for you.

325
00:12:00,128 --> 00:12:03,245
And Danny
fucking eats me.

326
00:12:03,368 --> 00:12:05,198
Why does he eat you? I don't know.

327
00:12:05,287 --> 00:12:07,801
I'm just trying to think of,
like, the nastiest way to go.

328
00:12:07,887 --> 00:12:10,277
Yeah, he could eat you.
Okay. That's a good idea, man.

329
00:12:10,368 --> 00:12:12,643
He's just out of his mind.
He just, like, eats me.

330
00:12:13,128 --> 00:12:14,322
Hey, Chris.
How's it going?

331
00:12:14,408 --> 00:12:16,364
Hey, does this coke smell funny? Ooh!

332
00:12:16,448 --> 00:12:18,359
Fuck! Michael, what the fuck, man?

333
00:12:18,448 --> 00:12:20,006
That's expensive shit,
motherfucker!

334
00:12:20,088 --> 00:12:21,157
What are you doing?

335
00:12:21,248 --> 00:12:23,604
I've never fucking done cocaine,
dude. Why does it fucking...

336
00:12:23,729 --> 00:12:25,606
Well, you did the best shit
possible for your first time,

337
00:12:25,729 --> 00:12:26,718
'cause that's
good fucking...

338
00:12:26,809 --> 00:12:28,003
Fuck, fuck, fuck,
I'm nervous, dude.

339
00:12:28,049 --> 00:12:29,402
I don't know what... What
is wrong with you, man?

340
00:12:29,489 --> 00:12:30,558
Look, he's freaking out. Oh, shit.

341
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:32,082
I've never done this
fucking drug before, man.

342
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:33,158
Mike, please.

343
00:12:33,249 --> 00:12:34,888
I'll walk you through it.
I will walk you through it.

344
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:36,688
Mike, no one...
I'll be your guide.

345
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:38,402
You're fine, Chris.
You're fine. Is it on...

346
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:39,559
You got some in
your mustache, baby.

347
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:40,685
What are you...
Michael!

348
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:42,961
Now, fellas, I want you
to real sexy right now.

349
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:45,120
We're gonna sing
to all the ladies.

350
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:48,640
All the fellas go like this,
in your Barry White voice.

351
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:53,728
# Take your panties off

352
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:55,643
# Take your panties off

353
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:59,006
# Come on, Rihanna
Take your panties off for me

354
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:02,049
# Come on, Craig,
can you fuck off for me? #

355
00:13:05,011 --> 00:13:06,729
I'll do one of them things.

356
00:13:07,331 --> 00:13:08,559
Like an angel.

357
00:13:08,691 --> 00:13:10,329
What about
the host of the party?

358
00:13:10,411 --> 00:13:12,084
# I ain't got
no panties on

359
00:13:12,732 --> 00:13:14,848
# He ain't got no
panties, everybody!

360
00:13:14,932 --> 00:13:16,650
# We ain't got
no panties on

361
00:13:16,772 --> 00:13:20,170
# We ain't got
no panties on

362
00:13:20,252 --> 00:13:22,482
# We ain't got no panties on

363
00:13:23,812 --> 00:13:25,565
# Ain't nobody
got no panties on

364
00:13:25,653 --> 00:13:27,086
# We ain't got
no panties on

365
00:13:27,213 --> 00:13:28,566
# Ain't no party
like a no-panty party

366
00:13:28,653 --> 00:13:30,006
# 'Cause a no-panty party
don't stop

367
00:13:30,572 --> 00:13:32,244
# Fuck those panties

368
00:13:32,332 --> 00:13:33,811
# Fuck those...

369
00:13:33,892 --> 00:13:37,406
# Fuck those panties

370
00:13:37,493 --> 00:13:39,006
# Fuck those panties #

371
00:13:39,093 --> 00:13:40,321
What's not kid-friendly?

372
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:41,886
There's a lot of sharp edges.
Concrete, sharp edges.

373
00:13:41,973 --> 00:13:43,691
He's gonna bust his head open
on one of those things.

374
00:13:43,813 --> 00:13:45,849
A kid could fall off this
fucking railing right here.

375
00:13:45,933 --> 00:13:47,651
That's why you have the railing,
so they don't fall.

376
00:13:47,813 --> 00:13:49,725
Hey. Sorry.
I want to have kids one day.

377
00:13:49,814 --> 00:13:52,408
Hey, Jay.
Oh, hey, hi, Jonah.

378
00:13:52,494 --> 00:13:54,485
Is there any place around here
I can buy a pack of cigarettes?

379
00:13:54,614 --> 00:13:55,649
Yeah.

380
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:57,326
There's a place like, it's like,
four blocks away, maybe.

381
00:13:58,014 --> 00:13:59,367
You want to
come with me?

382
00:13:59,494 --> 00:14:01,450
Give me this much time.
That much joint time.

383
00:14:02,735 --> 00:14:03,929
Oh!

384
00:14:04,015 --> 00:14:05,812
Jesus!
Hey, Jay.

385
00:14:06,295 --> 00:14:08,331
Hey, you need to use the toilet, honey?
Go ahead.

386
00:14:08,975 --> 00:14:10,806
Nope, I'm... I sorry.

387
00:14:11,175 --> 00:14:13,404
Who wants a sip?
Sip time.

388
00:14:25,575 --> 00:14:26,645
You okay, man?

389
00:14:26,736 --> 00:14:28,408
It's nothing.
It's just, you know,

390
00:14:28,496 --> 00:14:31,613
as soon as we got there, you did what you
said you wouldn't do.

391
00:14:31,736 --> 00:14:34,011
What did I do?
You just fucking ditched my ass.

392
00:14:34,096 --> 00:14:36,894
I didn't ditch you.
Are you kidding me, man?

393
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:38,170
I did not ditch you.

394
00:14:38,256 --> 00:14:41,613
I was talking to Jonah, and then you left
to go have a cigarette.

395
00:14:41,697 --> 00:14:44,769
Well, you know, my cigarette
was an excuse.

396
00:14:44,857 --> 00:14:46,927
I really went outside 'cause
Jonah was being a prick.

397
00:14:47,017 --> 00:14:48,689
Jonah was not
being a prick.

398
00:14:48,777 --> 00:14:50,290
If anything, you were
kind of being a prick.

399
00:14:50,377 --> 00:14:51,936
Jonah's the nicest
guy ever, man.

400
00:14:52,018 --> 00:14:54,737
Oh, my God, that's a thin veneer
of kindness.

401
00:14:54,818 --> 00:14:55,807
Nobody's that nice.

402
00:14:55,898 --> 00:14:56,966
Jonah is that nice.

403
00:14:57,097 --> 00:14:58,610
Serial killers
are that nice.

404
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:00,608
Just answer me
one question.

405
00:15:00,697 --> 00:15:02,972
Is Michael Cera's butthole
as adorable as I pictured?

406
00:15:03,057 --> 00:15:04,286
Oh, for fuck's sake.

407
00:15:04,378 --> 00:15:06,414
I picture it looking
like a little donut,

408
00:15:06,498 --> 00:15:08,090
like a little
pink sprinkled donut.

409
00:15:08,538 --> 00:15:10,130
Oh, it's so
bright in here.

410
00:15:10,218 --> 00:15:11,810
It is fucking bright.

411
00:15:11,898 --> 00:15:13,650
Oh, I'm so high.

412
00:15:13,738 --> 00:15:17,175
There's so many delicious choices.
What do I do?

413
00:15:17,259 --> 00:15:19,136
I'm gonna get something to drink.
Okay.

414
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:20,971
Excuse me,
would it be possible

415
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:22,492
for my daughter to
use your restroom?

416
00:15:22,579 --> 00:15:24,012
She's really got to go.

417
00:15:24,099 --> 00:15:26,488
Read the sign.
Customers only.

418
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:27,568
Seriously?

419
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:30,299
Why the fuck you think
I put up the sign?

420
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,132
It's okay, Dad. I can hold it.

421
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,728
Let's just buy something
for your mother.

422
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,380
Yeah, well,
I guess you better, huh?

423
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,211
This cash register lady
is mean.

424
00:15:39,299 --> 00:15:41,017
I have anxiety. Will
you buy this for me?

425
00:15:41,099 --> 00:15:42,533
When I'm stoned,
I can't do this.

426
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,815
I think I'm just gonna
head back to your place.

427
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,773
I'm not really liking it very
much over there at Franco's.

428
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,289
Dude, I want you to get to know
these guys. That's never gonna happen

429
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:53,292
if you don't put in any
effort whatsoever, okay?

430
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,939
I hate it in there.

431
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:57,615
I just want to drink some
pop and smoke some weed.

432
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:16,770
What about...

433
00:16:19,463 --> 00:16:21,215
What about me?

434
00:16:46,504 --> 00:16:47,983
Are you okay?
Are you okay?

435
00:16:48,064 --> 00:16:49,463
Did you just see that?

436
00:16:49,544 --> 00:16:50,863
What the hell?

437
00:16:52,224 --> 00:16:55,022
Oh, my God, Jesus, Jesus! Run, run, run!

438
00:16:56,304 --> 00:16:58,057
This way!
Okay, okay, okay!

439
00:17:03,185 --> 00:17:04,902
Oh, my God!
Oh, oh...

440
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,252
Oh, Jesus.

441
00:17:07,824 --> 00:17:08,939
Run!

442
00:17:09,025 --> 00:17:10,344
Jesus Christ!

443
00:17:10,705 --> 00:17:13,617
Why the fuck did you
bring me down here?

444
00:17:15,865 --> 00:17:17,935
The fuck, Seth? I don't
know what's happening!

445
00:17:19,225 --> 00:17:21,102
We're going back to Franco's. Why?

446
00:17:21,906 --> 00:17:24,101
Just run!
Keep running!

447
00:17:24,186 --> 00:17:25,414
Oh, my fuck!

448
00:17:27,106 --> 00:17:29,256
We are going
back to Franco's!

449
00:17:29,346 --> 00:17:30,415
Oh, God damn it.

450
00:17:32,026 --> 00:17:33,539
Jesus!
Oh, shit!

451
00:17:34,427 --> 00:17:37,578
This way. We're almost
there! We're so close!

452
00:17:42,867 --> 00:17:43,856
Hey, you guys okay?

453
00:17:43,947 --> 00:17:45,062
Are you guys okay?

454
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,980
There was a crazy earthquake.
Did you guys feel that?

455
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,466
That was insane.
Fuck, no.

456
00:17:49,547 --> 00:17:50,536
We can't feel
anything in here.

457
00:17:50,627 --> 00:17:52,299
This place is
a fucking fortress.

458
00:17:52,387 --> 00:17:54,139
That wasn't
an earthquake, man.

459
00:17:54,267 --> 00:17:55,859
That was something way
fucking crazier. No...

460
00:17:55,947 --> 00:17:56,936
What's crazier
than an earthquake?

461
00:17:57,027 --> 00:18:00,464
There were beams of blue
light coming out of the sky

462
00:18:00,548 --> 00:18:03,062
and people getting
sucked up into the sky.

463
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:05,343
He's on hallucinogens.

464
00:18:05,428 --> 00:18:09,137
Come on, guys. Don't bully
Jay. He's a sweetheart.

465
00:18:09,228 --> 00:18:10,502
Keep going, man. What
are you talking about?

466
00:18:11,909 --> 00:18:14,139
There were people,
and they were there,

467
00:18:14,229 --> 00:18:16,823
and they got
sucked up into the sky.

468
00:18:16,909 --> 00:18:18,706
Jay.
Sucked up into the sky?

469
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:20,347
Nobody got
sucked up in here.

470
00:18:20,429 --> 00:18:22,420
I got sucked off here.

471
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,863
No, okay, ask Seth.
He was...

472
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,065
You were there.
Tell them.

473
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,538
Seth, what the fuck's
he talking about?

474
00:18:34,309 --> 00:18:37,222
I have no idea what he's
talking about honestly.

475
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:40,063
Did anybody get
sucked up into the sky?

476
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,185
I didn't see anything.

477
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,703
I don't know what
he's talking about.

478
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,348
You were there with me.
What are you saying?

479
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:47,388
All those people that were in the store
with us, they just fucking vanished.

480
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:49,223
I didn't see blue light
sucking people up in the sky.

481
00:18:49,311 --> 00:18:51,700
You sound crazy, man.
We should just be lucky we're...

482
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:52,826
It's not over!

483
00:18:52,911 --> 00:18:54,060
It's okay.
Just relax.

484
00:18:54,511 --> 00:18:58,709
Everyone, it's all right. Just a
little tremor. Party's still going.

485
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:00,861
In-N-Out truck's
coming in 10 minutes.

486
00:19:02,032 --> 00:19:03,909
- Yes.
- Animal style!

487
00:19:04,032 --> 00:19:05,670
Oh, my fuck!

488
00:19:05,792 --> 00:19:07,589
- Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
- Move! Move!

489
00:19:07,672 --> 00:19:09,867
Move, move, move, move!
This place is safe!

490
00:19:09,952 --> 00:19:11,704
This place is not safe!

491
00:19:11,792 --> 00:19:13,065
Craig,
where you going, man?

492
00:19:13,151 --> 00:19:14,949
It's a fucking earthquake!
Fuck!

493
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:16,869
Move, move, move, come on!
Get out of my way. Move, girl!

494
00:19:16,992 --> 00:19:19,142
- Oh, my God, Seth!
- Oh, shit!

495
00:19:19,232 --> 00:19:20,631
Seth.
What the fuck?

496
00:19:20,752 --> 00:19:24,062
Don't go on the grass,
not everybody on the grass!

497
00:19:34,593 --> 00:19:36,106
What the fuck?

498
00:19:36,193 --> 00:19:37,672
Oh, God!

499
00:19:37,713 --> 00:19:39,306
What the fuck is happening? Paul!

500
00:19:39,394 --> 00:19:40,793
What's happening?

501
00:19:40,874 --> 00:19:43,593
All right, everybody,
listen up. Listen up.

502
00:19:43,674 --> 00:19:46,347
Who took my fucking
cell phone, man?

503
00:19:46,434 --> 00:19:48,994
Martin, empty your pockets! What?

504
00:19:49,114 --> 00:19:51,504
I saw you in the bathroom,
man! Somebody dial my phone!

505
00:19:51,595 --> 00:19:53,426
Shut the fuck up!
It's unbelievable!

506
00:19:53,515 --> 00:19:56,790
It's unacceptable after all the
coke I've wasted on you people.

507
00:19:56,914 --> 00:19:57,949
I've thrown it away.

508
00:19:58,034 --> 00:19:59,308
I didn't take your
fucking cell phone.

509
00:19:59,354 --> 00:20:02,505
310... Whoa, whoa, whoa! Mike, Mike,
Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike...

510
00:20:04,235 --> 00:20:05,509
My face!

511
00:20:05,595 --> 00:20:07,825
What's happening to me?
What's happening?

512
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,268
Oh, my God!

513
00:20:22,196 --> 00:20:23,993
Oh, shit,
that's embarrassing.

514
00:20:42,397 --> 00:20:43,386
Rihanna!

515
00:20:51,157 --> 00:20:52,192
Please give me
your foot!

516
00:20:52,277 --> 00:20:53,676
Oh, my God!

517
00:20:56,598 --> 00:20:58,270
Craig, Craig, help me.
I'm losing my grip!

518
00:20:58,358 --> 00:20:59,711
It's too late for you!
You're already in the hole!

519
00:20:59,798 --> 00:21:00,833
What the fuck
are you talking about?

520
00:21:00,918 --> 00:21:01,953
Get the fuck
out of my way!

521
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:05,912
Oh!

522
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:06,988
Sorry.

523
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:09,678
Karen!

524
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:12,432
Seth, come on! Get in
the house! Come on, Seth!

525
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:18,750
Oh, my God,
I'm gonna die!

526
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,232
Martin!

527
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:24,514
Oh, shit!
Kevin! Kevin!

528
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:25,634
What the fuck?

529
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:27,397
Geez, get the fuck
off me, Aziz!

530
00:21:27,639 --> 00:21:29,755
Ow, ow, ow!

531
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,079
Fuck you, Kevin!

532
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,355
Oh, God, no, get your
fucking hands off me!

533
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,714
Get your fucking...

534
00:21:49,401 --> 00:21:51,392
No!

535
00:21:51,481 --> 00:21:53,551
Jay, I can't hold on
much longer.

536
00:21:53,641 --> 00:21:56,554
You have to reach out
and grab me. You hear?

537
00:21:56,642 --> 00:22:00,351
Okay, uh, you take my hand,
and I will swing you up.

538
00:22:00,442 --> 00:22:02,080
Are you sure? I'm gonna
give you my whole weight.

539
00:22:02,202 --> 00:22:03,555
I'm gonna reach for you,
all right? Yeah, yeah.

540
00:22:03,642 --> 00:22:05,393
Are you sure
you can do that?

541
00:22:05,481 --> 00:22:06,709
I can grab you
on three.

542
00:22:06,841 --> 00:22:08,399
One, two, three.

543
00:22:11,682 --> 00:22:12,671
All right, buddy.

544
00:22:12,762 --> 00:22:14,753
Now I'm gonna,
I'm gonna swing across.

545
00:22:14,842 --> 00:22:15,877
I got you, buddy.

546
00:22:15,962 --> 00:22:17,395
You're gonna hold
my weight, all of it.

547
00:22:17,522 --> 00:22:18,511
Okay, come on.

548
00:22:18,602 --> 00:22:20,593
You can hold on to my
full weight? I can do it.

549
00:22:20,682 --> 00:22:21,638
I don't want to die.
Okay.

550
00:22:21,723 --> 00:22:23,395
One, two...
Two, three.

551
00:22:23,883 --> 00:22:25,111
No!

552
00:22:26,003 --> 00:22:29,154
No! No!

553
00:22:51,564 --> 00:22:53,236
Oh, man.

554
00:22:55,004 --> 00:22:56,198
Fuck.

555
00:23:06,405 --> 00:23:07,679
Holy shit!
What happened?

556
00:23:07,765 --> 00:23:09,323
Jay, you're alive.
Jay.

557
00:23:09,405 --> 00:23:10,758
Oh, thank God, Jay.
I'm not dead yet.

558
00:23:10,845 --> 00:23:12,359
I told you guys
not to go outside.

559
00:23:12,446 --> 00:23:13,481
What just happened?

560
00:23:13,566 --> 00:23:14,919
Jesus Christ, they are
all fucking dead.

561
00:23:15,006 --> 00:23:16,564
I told you guys
not to run outside.

562
00:23:16,646 --> 00:23:17,635
You all right?

563
00:23:17,726 --> 00:23:19,637
I tried to save Aziz.
I tried.

564
00:23:19,726 --> 00:23:21,523
You did your best, man.
I love you.

565
00:23:21,606 --> 00:23:23,882
Why the fuck did you
guys run out there?

566
00:23:24,007 --> 00:23:25,520
You know what, James,
can you lower your voice?

567
00:23:25,607 --> 00:23:26,801
You're freaking out Jay!

568
00:23:26,927 --> 00:23:28,724
Maybe I'm a little
freaked out, too!

569
00:23:28,847 --> 00:23:30,359
- He's not as strong as you.
- They all fell in.

570
00:23:30,486 --> 00:23:32,602
- Look at my house!
- I tried to save them. They all fell in.

571
00:23:32,766 --> 00:23:35,326
Get your fucking hands off me.
Jonah, stop touching me.

572
00:23:35,406 --> 00:23:36,965
Can we get Jay
some water, please?

573
00:23:37,047 --> 00:23:38,241
Can we get him
some hydration?

574
00:23:38,287 --> 00:23:39,766
- He needs to be hydrated.
- The water's not working!

575
00:23:39,847 --> 00:23:41,326
Everyone just
runs out the door!

576
00:23:41,407 --> 00:23:42,681
My phone is dead.

577
00:23:42,767 --> 00:23:44,439
Guys, the fucking
Internet's not working!

578
00:23:44,527 --> 00:23:46,404
Let's watch the TV.
Let's check the news.

579
00:23:46,487 --> 00:23:48,239
Where is the TV?

580
00:23:48,367 --> 00:23:50,359
It's in the floor.
In the floor?

581
00:23:50,448 --> 00:23:52,166
- Oh, that's dope.
- Yeah, cool, huh?

582
00:23:52,288 --> 00:23:53,277
That's really neat.

583
00:23:53,368 --> 00:23:54,767
That is impressive, James.

584
00:23:54,888 --> 00:23:56,958
The biggest earthquake
to ever hit Los...

585
00:23:57,048 --> 00:23:59,846
Officers urging people
to stay in their homes right now.

586
00:23:59,928 --> 00:24:01,920
And also reports of looting
and rioting

587
00:24:02,049 --> 00:24:03,038
are spreading
across the city.

588
00:24:03,129 --> 00:24:04,278
Riots.

589
00:24:04,369 --> 00:24:05,722
Police are pretty
much outnumbered

590
00:24:05,809 --> 00:24:07,879
as people are
turning to one another.

591
00:24:07,969 --> 00:24:09,687
Martial law has
now been declared.

592
00:24:09,769 --> 00:24:11,248
Air Force One
has gone down...

593
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:15,287
Shit. It's gone, guys.

594
00:24:16,209 --> 00:24:19,519
So I think we should...

595
00:24:19,649 --> 00:24:22,721
I think we should probably
go back to your place, eh?

596
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:24,208
What are you
talking about, man?

597
00:24:24,289 --> 00:24:27,487
No, no way.
I'm not leaving here.

598
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:30,926
I don't want to die
at James Franco's house.

599
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:32,883
You heard the TV.

600
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:36,645
The TV said stay here.
It said stay in your homes.

601
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:39,803
We need to stay here until they
start rescuing people, okay?

602
00:24:39,891 --> 00:24:42,405
A huge earthquake happens.
Who do they rescue first?

603
00:24:42,491 --> 00:24:43,890
Actors.
Famous people.

604
00:24:43,971 --> 00:24:46,439
They'll get Clooney,
Sandra Bullock, me.

605
00:24:46,531 --> 00:24:48,283
If there's room,
you guys'll come.

606
00:24:48,371 --> 00:24:50,487
The point is, is that we're all
gonna get out of this first.

607
00:24:51,652 --> 00:24:52,641
What the hell was that?

608
00:24:52,732 --> 00:24:54,085
It's already going
crazy out there, guys.

609
00:24:54,172 --> 00:24:57,402
We can't leave. I'm not leaving, okay?
I'm a victim.

610
00:24:57,491 --> 00:25:00,324
I've had a victim's mentality my whole life.
People can smell it on me.

611
00:25:00,411 --> 00:25:02,242
When I was a kid,
I had man-titties.

612
00:25:02,331 --> 00:25:04,004
The bullies held me down,
they tittie-fucked me.

613
00:25:04,092 --> 00:25:05,411
That's what's happening
out there right now.

614
00:25:05,532 --> 00:25:06,760
That's right,
we are all soft.

615
00:25:06,852 --> 00:25:07,967
Yeah.
We are all soft!

616
00:25:08,052 --> 00:25:10,008
We are actors! We
pretend to be hard, man.

617
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:11,923
Yeah.
We soft as baby shit.

618
00:25:12,012 --> 00:25:14,606
As baby shit, soft as...
Wait, Craig, what are you doing, man?

619
00:25:14,692 --> 00:25:17,161
Hey, hey, what are you doing?
What are you doing to the painting, man?

620
00:25:17,293 --> 00:25:18,885
We got to board this shit up, man.
Board it up?

621
00:25:18,973 --> 00:25:20,406
We got to protect ourselves.
We don't know

622
00:25:20,533 --> 00:25:22,205
how long we gonna be in here.
Okay, chill.

623
00:25:22,293 --> 00:25:23,487
There's raccoons, and bandits,
and shit out there.

624
00:25:23,573 --> 00:25:25,052
This is Obey, man!
If you get out the way!

625
00:25:25,133 --> 00:25:27,442
This is my favorite fucking painting!
What are you doing, Craig?

626
00:25:27,533 --> 00:25:28,523
Guys, help.

627
00:25:28,614 --> 00:25:30,445
Help. Help. Get off.

628
00:25:31,934 --> 00:25:33,128
Chill. Look.

629
00:25:33,214 --> 00:25:35,011
Helicopter!
Helicopter!

630
00:25:36,374 --> 00:25:40,127
The good guys are here.
We're fine! It's gonna be fine.

631
00:25:44,374 --> 00:25:45,853
God damn!

632
00:25:45,934 --> 00:25:47,845
Oh! God damn!

633
00:25:48,254 --> 00:25:49,687
Ow! Shit!

634
00:25:49,774 --> 00:25:50,763
You okay?

635
00:25:50,854 --> 00:25:52,173
No, I'm not okay!

636
00:25:52,254 --> 00:25:54,371
Fuck your house, Franco!

637
00:25:54,495 --> 00:25:56,725
My house didn't do that! Aah!

638
00:25:57,775 --> 00:25:59,003
Ow.

639
00:26:02,255 --> 00:26:05,213
You don't got a tool kit
or nothing? Just a toolbox?

640
00:26:05,295 --> 00:26:06,649
I don't know.
Look in there.

641
00:26:10,336 --> 00:26:12,213
Where's the edge
of this shit?

642
00:26:12,296 --> 00:26:14,412
Your thumb's
in my butthole, man.

643
00:26:14,736 --> 00:26:15,930
Whoa.

644
00:26:16,016 --> 00:26:17,654
Y'all need this dick?

645
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:18,766
No, we're not using it.

646
00:26:18,857 --> 00:26:20,336
All right, I'm gonna
take it over here.

647
00:26:20,417 --> 00:26:22,771
Careful with that dick.
Damn.

648
00:26:26,096 --> 00:26:27,449
It's heavy.

649
00:26:28,096 --> 00:26:31,248
There it is,
got that dick now.

650
00:26:31,337 --> 00:26:33,771
That dick is coming now.

651
00:26:34,297 --> 00:26:36,606
Yeah, got this big dick.

652
00:26:40,817 --> 00:26:42,250
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, hey.

653
00:26:42,337 --> 00:26:43,896
What now?
Listen.

654
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:47,015
Not the Rogen, all right?
Don't take him.

655
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:48,173
Take me.

656
00:26:48,258 --> 00:26:51,694
We got 12 bottles of water,
56 beers, two vodkas,

657
00:26:51,778 --> 00:26:54,895
four whiskeys, six bottles of wine,
tequila, Nutella,

658
00:26:54,978 --> 00:26:58,654
cheese, pizza, eggs, bananas,
apples, bacon, steaks,

659
00:26:58,739 --> 00:27:02,652
pancake mix, CT Crunch, milk,
ketchup, a Milky Way,

660
00:27:02,779 --> 00:27:05,815
half ounce Sour Diesel, three and
a half grams Grand Master Kush,

661
00:27:05,898 --> 00:27:08,048
one ounce of 'shrooms,
15 pills of ecstasy,

662
00:27:08,138 --> 00:27:10,130
a porno mag,
a baseball bat,

663
00:27:10,219 --> 00:27:12,574
and the video camera
from the movie 27 Hours.

664
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:14,138
127 Hours.

665
00:27:14,459 --> 00:27:15,892
Uh...

666
00:27:15,979 --> 00:27:17,776
127 Hours.

667
00:27:17,859 --> 00:27:21,057
And a functioning revolver
from the movie Flyboys.

668
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,539
Old Faithful.

669
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:23,939
Jesus.
Thing's real.

670
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,817
No, I kept this from the movie. Yeah.

671
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,458
This is an actual revolver. I see.

672
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,575
Franco, that's
very uncomfortable.

673
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,695
Could you put
that down, please?

674
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:30,735
Loaded.

675
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,219
Love it.
Awesome.

676
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,013
Can you just put the gun
away? I always keep my props.

677
00:27:34,101 --> 00:27:36,137
That's really cool.
Always keep my props.

678
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:37,290
I know how to
handle it.

679
00:27:37,381 --> 00:27:38,894
He knows what he's doing.
I like this bit.

680
00:27:38,981 --> 00:27:40,380
I like it. I get it.
Let me see.

681
00:27:40,461 --> 00:27:42,417
It's real. It's heavy.
Let me see it like that.

682
00:27:42,501 --> 00:27:44,093
God damn!
Come on, guys!

683
00:27:44,181 --> 00:27:45,250
You could kill...
Careful.

684
00:27:45,341 --> 00:27:46,411
Bang, bang!
Jesus!

685
00:27:46,502 --> 00:27:47,820
Please, put it down!
Oh, fuck!

686
00:27:47,901 --> 00:27:49,937
Bang, bang, bang.
You're dead.

687
00:27:50,061 --> 00:27:52,097
I hope you're fucking happy.
Pow, pow, pow.

688
00:27:52,181 --> 00:27:53,853
Stop...
Guys, stop fucking with the gun.

689
00:27:53,941 --> 00:27:55,454
Jesus! Jesus!
Pow, pow.

690
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:56,530
It's a real gun!
Bang.

691
00:27:56,621 --> 00:27:57,610
It's so funny.
It's so funny.

692
00:27:57,701 --> 00:27:59,135
Guys, it's funny.
It's not funny!

693
00:27:59,222 --> 00:28:00,621
We're getting
sidetracked.

694
00:28:00,702 --> 00:28:01,976
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

695
00:28:02,062 --> 00:28:03,461
I'll just kill myself.
No!

696
00:28:03,542 --> 00:28:04,691
Don't do that, Jonah!
Jesus.

697
00:28:04,782 --> 00:28:05,771
Oh, no.
Jonah, give it back.

698
00:28:05,862 --> 00:28:07,454
I don't know! I don't know.
Don't do that.

699
00:28:07,542 --> 00:28:09,294
Jonah.
I'm so...

700
00:28:09,382 --> 00:28:11,135
- Oh, my God. Hey.
- Oh, dude.

701
00:28:11,223 --> 00:28:12,702
Come on, no, no.
Don't. Jesus!

702
00:28:12,743 --> 00:28:14,301
Would you put the thing down?
The whole...

703
00:28:14,383 --> 00:28:15,657
I'm trying to
have some fun, man.

704
00:28:15,743 --> 00:28:17,415
Okay, okay, Jesus.

705
00:28:17,503 --> 00:28:19,653
Look, just because a bunch of
people fell into a hole outside

706
00:28:19,743 --> 00:28:21,096
doesn't mean we can't
have some fun.

707
00:28:21,183 --> 00:28:23,823
We're a bunch of best friends
hanging out. It's like a sleepover.

708
00:28:23,904 --> 00:28:26,259
Okay, food. How are we
gonna deal with this?

709
00:28:27,104 --> 00:28:28,139
Um...

710
00:28:28,224 --> 00:28:29,418
Can I have that
Milky Way?

711
00:28:29,503 --> 00:28:30,936
No, you can't have
the Milky Way.

712
00:28:31,063 --> 00:28:32,178
That's my Milky Way.
There's a bunch... What?

713
00:28:32,263 --> 00:28:33,662
I went out
this morning,

714
00:28:33,743 --> 00:28:36,816
specifically bought this Milky
Way to eat after my party.

715
00:28:36,904 --> 00:28:37,893
That's weird.

716
00:28:37,984 --> 00:28:39,417
It's not weird.
It's my special food.

717
00:28:39,504 --> 00:28:41,142
I like it. Back me up on that, Seth.

718
00:28:41,224 --> 00:28:42,498
I don't think you should get
the whole Milky Way.

719
00:28:42,584 --> 00:28:43,619
I want some
of the Milky Way.

720
00:28:43,704 --> 00:28:46,423
I'd be pretty bummed if I don't at
least get a bite of the Milky Way.

721
00:28:46,504 --> 00:28:47,539
Oh! Now Craig wants
a bite of the Milky Way.

722
00:28:47,624 --> 00:28:50,014
Yeah, I want a bite of the Milky
Way. It's a fucking Milky Way.

723
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:52,818
A fifth of everything is
what's fair and reasonable.

724
00:28:52,905 --> 00:28:54,702
Everyone gets
a fifth of everything.

725
00:28:54,785 --> 00:28:56,343
I want one-fifth
of your T-shirt!

726
00:28:56,425 --> 00:28:58,177
I want the bottom part,
the belly.

727
00:28:58,265 --> 00:28:59,698
I'm not sporting
a crop top in your house.

728
00:28:59,785 --> 00:29:01,344
I'll cut that shit off
and make a headband.

729
00:29:01,426 --> 00:29:03,144
You couldn't
handle my midriff.

730
00:29:03,226 --> 00:29:06,059
Guys, the only issue is,
I kind of need the Milky Way.

731
00:29:06,146 --> 00:29:07,295
For fuck's sake.

732
00:29:07,386 --> 00:29:08,705
No, for real,
I have low blood sugar,

733
00:29:08,786 --> 00:29:09,775
and if my endorphins
drop too low,

734
00:29:09,866 --> 00:29:10,855
I'm gonna be
a nightmare to be around.

735
00:29:10,946 --> 00:29:12,856
What? Your LBS starts acting up,

736
00:29:12,945 --> 00:29:14,902
you can have a finger
scoop of Nutella, okay?

737
00:29:14,986 --> 00:29:17,375
One finger scoop of Nutella. Fair.

738
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:19,098
I'm going to bed.

739
00:29:19,186 --> 00:29:20,619
Jesus fucking...

740
00:29:20,706 --> 00:29:22,264
Don't touch that
Milky Way, Jonah.

741
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:23,660
Night, James.

742
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:31,027
Oh, God, no!

743
00:29:31,867 --> 00:29:33,186
Fuck.

744
00:30:01,988 --> 00:30:04,423
Hey.
Hey.

745
00:30:04,909 --> 00:30:06,342
I'm gonna
sleep with you.

746
00:30:06,389 --> 00:30:07,742
What? I'm gonna sleep with you.

747
00:30:07,829 --> 00:30:08,864
It's too scary
to sleep alone.

748
00:30:08,949 --> 00:30:09,938
But this is
my little area.

749
00:30:10,029 --> 00:30:11,667
Well, I'm invading
your little area.

750
00:30:11,749 --> 00:30:14,661
I'm sorry, but I'm
too scared, okay?

751
00:30:14,749 --> 00:30:15,739
Are you mad at me, man?

752
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:17,582
If I was pissed at you,

753
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:19,900
I'm sure it would
have something to do

754
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,588
with the fact that
I had no interest

755
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:24,662
in coming to
this house socially,

756
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:27,583
and now,
I am barricaded in here

757
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:30,629
with a bunch of people
that I really hate.

758
00:30:31,031 --> 00:30:32,783
Maybe this was
meant to be.

759
00:30:32,871 --> 00:30:36,102
Maybe this horrible, horrible,
deadly earthquake happened

760
00:30:36,191 --> 00:30:38,465
so we could become closer
as a group of friends.

761
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:42,140
I don't need a group. I'm
like DMX, man. I'm a lone wolf.

762
00:30:42,231 --> 00:30:43,710
DMX isn't a lone wolf.

763
00:30:44,151 --> 00:30:45,869
DMX has
the Ruff Ryder crew.

764
00:30:45,951 --> 00:30:48,226
You can't stop, drop,
and open up shop alone.

765
00:30:48,351 --> 00:30:52,469
You need people to help you in
an earthquake disastery situation.

766
00:30:52,551 --> 00:30:56,465
It was something else.
It was Judgment Day.

767
00:30:56,552 --> 00:30:57,905
Like Terminator 2?

768
00:30:57,992 --> 00:31:00,267
No, not like Terminator 2.
For God's sakes.

769
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:02,149
Like Skynet?
You think this is Skynet?

770
00:31:02,232 --> 00:31:03,460
Like, Skynet went live?
No.

771
00:31:03,552 --> 00:31:05,304
Will you please
stop saying "Skynet"?

772
00:31:05,392 --> 00:31:07,509
Well, you're the one
that said Judgment Day.

773
00:31:07,593 --> 00:31:09,185
The biblical
Judgment Day.

774
00:31:10,513 --> 00:31:12,310
What? That's crazy. It's just...

775
00:31:12,393 --> 00:31:13,587
You fucking heathen.

776
00:31:13,713 --> 00:31:14,702
Okay, here's the thing.

777
00:31:14,793 --> 00:31:17,023
Let's say for a second
there was blue light

778
00:31:17,113 --> 00:31:18,672
sucking people
up into the sky.

779
00:31:18,754 --> 00:31:22,223
That means that we were not
awesome enough to go to heaven.

780
00:31:22,593 --> 00:31:24,663
Shit! Shit.

781
00:31:29,433 --> 00:31:31,186
What y'all doing?

782
00:31:31,914 --> 00:31:33,029
Fuck you, Craig.

783
00:31:33,114 --> 00:31:34,945
I'm scared.
It's scary by myself.

784
00:31:35,034 --> 00:31:36,672
It's way better
with more people.

785
00:31:37,074 --> 00:31:38,109
I'm gonna
come down here.

786
00:31:38,194 --> 00:31:40,628
Oh, yeah, good, yeah.
Get in here, man.

787
00:31:40,714 --> 00:31:41,669
Get right in there.

788
00:31:41,754 --> 00:31:43,347
So, you're gonna...

789
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:44,834
Right here.
Right here.

790
00:31:44,955 --> 00:31:47,549
I feel better, actually. I like that.

791
00:31:49,195 --> 00:31:50,947
It's better with
more people.

792
00:31:51,035 --> 00:31:52,024
Hey, guys...

793
00:31:52,115 --> 00:31:54,185
- Jesus Christ.
- Jesus!

794
00:31:54,275 --> 00:31:56,744
Sorry. Franco has this
crazy open floor plan.

795
00:31:56,836 --> 00:31:58,747
I can hear every word
you guys are saying.

796
00:31:58,836 --> 00:32:01,145
I might as well hang with
you guys if that's cool.

797
00:32:01,236 --> 00:32:02,874
Nice.
Coming in hot.

798
00:32:02,956 --> 00:32:04,547
I gonna grab
a blanket from you.

799
00:32:04,635 --> 00:32:05,954
Give me that blanket.

800
00:32:06,035 --> 00:32:07,787
Get in the middle of it. That's good.

801
00:32:07,875 --> 00:32:10,106
That's it. It feels so
much more safe now, guys.

802
00:32:10,196 --> 00:32:11,345
It's nice here.

803
00:32:11,436 --> 00:32:12,789
Should we spoon it?
Yeah, you want to?

804
00:32:12,876 --> 00:32:13,991
No!
Want to go...

805
00:32:14,076 --> 00:32:15,065
Dick to butt?
No.

806
00:32:15,156 --> 00:32:16,225
My butt to you
and then Jay.

807
00:32:16,316 --> 00:32:18,147
I don't want to butt
to dick to anything.

808
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:19,464
Are you docking into me?
You're doing tip to me?

809
00:32:19,556 --> 00:32:20,546
Or what
are you doing?

810
00:32:20,637 --> 00:32:21,706
Should we go butt to butt or dick to...

811
00:32:21,797 --> 00:32:22,786
Seth and I are
gonna go ass to ass.

812
00:32:22,877 --> 00:32:24,071
Do you want to go
front to front?

813
00:32:24,157 --> 00:32:26,227
No, I'm fine
just going dicks up.

814
00:32:26,317 --> 00:32:27,386
Dicks up?

815
00:32:27,477 --> 00:32:28,956
I think I'm going dick
to ass. You know what?

816
00:32:29,037 --> 00:32:31,073
I'm going
Scarface-style.

817
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:32,385
Both of you guys.
Wait, yeah.

818
00:32:32,477 --> 00:32:33,627
There we go.
Yeah.

819
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:34,753
This is the best way.

820
00:32:34,838 --> 00:32:35,907
Good night, boys.

821
00:32:35,998 --> 00:32:38,353
Good night.
Good night.

822
00:32:38,438 --> 00:32:39,666
Good night, guys.

823
00:32:39,758 --> 00:32:41,476
Night, my sweet guys.
Good night.

824
00:32:41,598 --> 00:32:42,667
Sweet dreams, fellas.

825
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:11,229
# Livin' on fat pockets
on flat wit tha gat

826
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,754
# Rollin' around
a nine deuce Cadillac

827
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,155
# Still got my homies
to watch my back

828
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,595
# And they'll smoke ya ass
if you wanna come and chat

829
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,518
# Why wallow when you come
to roll on? I put the clip

830
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,677
# And before
I bring ya ass on

831
00:33:23,761 --> 00:33:25,911
# Kickin ' dust on your head
like I bust

832
00:33:26,001 --> 00:33:27,912
# My grip surrounded,
I'm about...

833
00:33:28,001 --> 00:33:29,319
Fuck, yeah.

834
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,198
# When tha shit goes down
ya better be ready

835
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,599
# When tha shit goes down

836
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:37,196
# When tha shit goes down
ya better be ready

837
00:33:37,321 --> 00:33:38,356
# When tha shit goes down

838
00:33:38,441 --> 00:33:41,717
# When tha shit goes down
ya better be ready

839
00:33:41,801 --> 00:33:43,598
# Ya better be ready #

840
00:34:02,363 --> 00:34:04,752
Franco!
Good morning, sunshine.

841
00:34:04,843 --> 00:34:06,071
Guys! Guys! Wake up!

842
00:34:06,163 --> 00:34:08,961
Danny's alive! He's eating
all the fucking food!

843
00:34:09,043 --> 00:34:10,999
No!
Danny, man, don't.

844
00:34:11,723 --> 00:34:12,917
Danny!

845
00:34:13,763 --> 00:34:16,038
No, it's cool, man. I fucking
made this for you guys.

846
00:34:16,123 --> 00:34:17,112
Stop eating!

847
00:34:17,203 --> 00:34:18,318
Don't eat another
piece of bacon.

848
00:34:18,403 --> 00:34:19,518
Guys, just chill
the fuck out, okay?

849
00:34:19,603 --> 00:34:22,561
I'm sure the Green Goblin can
fucking afford some more bacon.

850
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:24,918
Dude, that shit's supposed to
last us till we get rescued!

851
00:34:25,404 --> 00:34:28,441
Wait a second.
I know what happened.

852
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:31,118
You guys dropped acid,
didn't you? Mmm-hmm.

853
00:34:31,364 --> 00:34:33,400
Craig doesn't have any pants
on. He got fucking wild.

854
00:34:33,484 --> 00:34:35,918
Probably danced, sweated
all over the place.

855
00:34:36,004 --> 00:34:37,278
You got white shit all
over your mouth, Franco.

856
00:34:37,364 --> 00:34:38,639
You probably sucked
somebody's dick.

857
00:34:38,725 --> 00:34:41,523
Jonah over here probably
watched and jerked off.

858
00:34:41,605 --> 00:34:43,755
Jay, I didn't even know you
were in town. Good to see you.

859
00:34:43,845 --> 00:34:46,200
Danny, we're not on acid. We
didn't suck each other's dicks!

860
00:34:46,285 --> 00:34:49,004
James Franco didn't suck
any dick last night?

861
00:34:49,085 --> 00:34:50,644
Now I know
y'all are tripping.

862
00:34:50,726 --> 00:34:52,557
You actually not know
what happened last night?

863
00:34:52,646 --> 00:34:55,205
Daniel, you may want to
stay seated for a second.

864
00:34:55,285 --> 00:34:57,162
Some really
messed-up stuff happened,

865
00:34:57,245 --> 00:34:59,475
and there were
a lot of fatalities.

866
00:34:59,565 --> 00:35:02,238
Oh, really? You're putting
your serious voice on, Jonah?

867
00:35:02,325 --> 00:35:04,715
Okay, tell me about
these "fatalities. "

868
00:35:04,806 --> 00:35:07,878
Dude, Segel's dead, Krumholtz
is dead, Michael Cera's dead.

869
00:35:07,966 --> 00:35:11,641
Guess if Michael Cera's gone,
it's not a total loss, huh?

870
00:35:11,726 --> 00:35:13,239
Jesus, Danny.
Michael Cera's dead.

871
00:35:13,326 --> 00:35:15,044
What?
It's not like that.

872
00:35:15,126 --> 00:35:16,799
It's not funny, man.
It's really not funny.

873
00:35:16,927 --> 00:35:17,916
Seth, that's
a better performance

874
00:35:18,007 --> 00:35:19,565
than you've given in
your last six movies.

875
00:35:19,647 --> 00:35:21,365
Where the fuck was that
in Green Hornet, huh?

876
00:35:21,447 --> 00:35:23,278
Jonah, you're fucking
sucking balls.

877
00:35:23,367 --> 00:35:24,959
You're an Academy Award
nominated person.

878
00:35:25,047 --> 00:35:27,402
You need to be fucking
selling that shit, dude.

879
00:35:27,487 --> 00:35:29,524
"Fatalities.
There were some fatalities. "

880
00:35:30,248 --> 00:35:31,283
Fatalities.

881
00:35:32,168 --> 00:35:33,840
Okay, now that was good.
That was good.

882
00:35:33,928 --> 00:35:35,919
Does it seem like
we're fucking joking?

883
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:38,567
Hey, hey, hey! What the
fuck you eating, man?

884
00:35:38,687 --> 00:35:41,486
Spit it out your mouth.
Give me the bacon!

885
00:35:47,928 --> 00:35:49,156
Shit.

886
00:35:50,008 --> 00:35:51,327
Shit, what do we do?

887
00:35:51,408 --> 00:35:53,240
Shoot 'em!
Shoot 'em! Shoot 'em!

888
00:35:58,209 --> 00:35:59,244
Should I shoot?

889
00:35:59,369 --> 00:36:01,405
- Shut up, Franco!
- Shoot the door, Franco!

890
00:36:02,089 --> 00:36:03,124
Oh, God!

891
00:36:03,209 --> 00:36:05,804
Did you not hear me knocking out here?
I've been knocking forever.

892
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:07,767
Please! Please!
You've got to let me in!

893
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:10,960
Hang on a second.
What?

894
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:13,518
Guys, I know
it sounds really weird,

895
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:16,044
but I don't think
we should let him in.

896
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:17,285
Why not?

897
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:19,089
Yeah, why not?
I can hear you, by the way.

898
00:36:19,171 --> 00:36:20,808
I'm sorry.
We just don't know you, man.

899
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:24,326
You could be like, a looter, or a rapist,
or a tittie-fucker.

900
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:25,729
Like, I'm sorry.

901
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:28,643
Look, guys, we just boarded up this
whole house to keep everyone out,

902
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:31,291
and the first guy comes to the door,
we're gonna let him in?

903
00:36:31,371 --> 00:36:32,884
I mean, how do we know
we can trust this guy?

904
00:36:32,971 --> 00:36:35,724
I want to live!
Things have gone crazy out here!

905
00:36:35,811 --> 00:36:39,042
"Fucking crazy out here!"
This guy fucking sucks.

906
00:36:39,131 --> 00:36:40,166
What if he's the rapist?

907
00:36:40,251 --> 00:36:41,366
Man, even if he
is a rapist,

908
00:36:41,451 --> 00:36:43,249
he can't rape all of us.
Yeah! No! So I'm not...

909
00:36:43,332 --> 00:36:44,924
I'm not a rapist!
You want to tittie-fuck us?

910
00:36:45,012 --> 00:36:47,765
If you want me to tittie-fuck you, I will!
So good! You'll love it.

911
00:36:47,852 --> 00:36:49,126
Seth, back me up, please.

912
00:36:49,212 --> 00:36:51,521
We can't just leave him out there to die.
Are you crazy?

913
00:36:51,652 --> 00:36:53,608
What do you want to do?
I'll do whatever you want to do.

914
00:36:53,692 --> 00:36:54,761
Let's vote on it.

915
00:36:54,852 --> 00:36:56,650
Yeah, I fucking vote
you let me in.

916
00:36:56,733 --> 00:36:58,166
Here's my vote.
Fuck all of you.

917
00:36:58,253 --> 00:36:59,732
I'm letting him in.
This is boring.

918
00:37:00,613 --> 00:37:01,602
There's something out here!

919
00:37:07,773 --> 00:37:09,843
This is real!
This is fucking real!

920
00:37:10,533 --> 00:37:11,682
God damn it!

921
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:26,967
You guys!

922
00:37:27,054 --> 00:37:28,453
This man was alive
a few seconds ago.

923
00:37:28,534 --> 00:37:30,047
We can't play soccer
with his head!

924
00:37:30,134 --> 00:37:31,487
Pick it up, Jonah!

925
00:37:33,135 --> 00:37:34,534
What the fuck
is going on?

926
00:37:34,655 --> 00:37:36,213
He blinked at me.

927
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:38,411
He blinked at my face.
Seth, put it over there.

928
00:37:39,815 --> 00:37:41,009
Oh, my God!

929
00:37:41,095 --> 00:37:42,323
I got it.
I got it, guys.

930
00:37:42,455 --> 00:37:44,810
There's blood
all over my floor!

931
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:46,214
Time to relax for a second.

932
00:37:46,335 --> 00:37:49,088
Okay, someone should
look out the hole.

933
00:37:49,175 --> 00:37:50,244
I ain't looking
out that hole!

934
00:37:50,335 --> 00:37:52,371
Last person looked through that
hole got his head chopped off!

935
00:37:52,455 --> 00:37:56,653
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Whatever is
out there might still be out there.

936
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:00,851
Okay, I know, I know.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

937
00:38:01,976 --> 00:38:05,173
Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, God.

938
00:38:06,816 --> 00:38:08,488
There's a lookout!

939
00:38:14,337 --> 00:38:16,453
Jesus Christ! Look, there's a
huge fucking hole down there!

940
00:38:16,537 --> 00:38:18,334
What the fuck is this?

941
00:38:19,017 --> 00:38:20,416
Where's the thing
that killed the guy?

942
00:38:20,537 --> 00:38:21,606
I don't know.

943
00:38:21,697 --> 00:38:22,847
How'd his head
fall off?

944
00:38:22,938 --> 00:38:24,166
And where's
the rest of him?

945
00:38:30,737 --> 00:38:32,011
Hi.

946
00:38:32,097 --> 00:38:33,769
This is James Franco,

947
00:38:35,498 --> 00:38:37,966
in my house,
in my library.

948
00:38:38,098 --> 00:38:41,488
We've been stuck here
for about 24 hours.

949
00:38:41,578 --> 00:38:43,967
Danny McBride is here.

950
00:38:44,058 --> 00:38:45,457
I didn't even
invite him to my party,

951
00:38:45,538 --> 00:38:48,133
but he came and passed
out in the bathtub,

952
00:38:48,219 --> 00:38:51,291
and I got to say it's, like,
typical fucking McBride.

953
00:38:51,379 --> 00:38:55,497
Like, I've been feeling
really weird about him lately.

954
00:38:55,579 --> 00:38:58,571
Like, I don't really know if
I want to be friends with him,

955
00:38:58,659 --> 00:39:02,494
and then he fucking
showed up at my party,

956
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:07,176
and now, we're stuck here with
him in disaster lockdown, so...

957
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,693
What up?
What's going on?

958
00:39:11,779 --> 00:39:13,179
Hey, Danny.
What's up, man?

959
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,768
Not much. What are you
doing? What is this?

960
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:18,328
Oh, it's just
a video confessional.

961
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,414
Fuck that dude.

962
00:39:27,181 --> 00:39:28,933
- Earthquakes cause tsunamis.
- Yes.

963
00:39:29,021 --> 00:39:31,410
Tsunamis cause
other tsunamis, disaster.

964
00:39:31,501 --> 00:39:33,492
I mean, for all we know, the
fucking Lakers could have just won,

965
00:39:33,581 --> 00:39:34,980
and that's the reason
why all this is happening.

966
00:39:35,061 --> 00:39:37,017
Hole in Franco's front yard? Sinkhole.

967
00:39:37,101 --> 00:39:40,458
Every single time I turn on the news,
sinkhole in South America.

968
00:39:40,582 --> 00:39:42,174
Bunch of South Americans
getting sucked into the ground.

969
00:39:42,262 --> 00:39:43,695
Sinkhole de Mayo.
Sinkhole de Mayo.

970
00:39:43,782 --> 00:39:44,817
That's why it's
named that,

971
00:39:44,902 --> 00:39:46,494
because sinkholes happen
in the summertime.

972
00:39:46,582 --> 00:39:50,576
It's not wildfires. It's not earthquakes.
It's not sinkholes.

973
00:39:50,663 --> 00:39:51,778
I think I know
what it is.

974
00:39:51,863 --> 00:39:52,852
Let's hear it.

975
00:39:53,783 --> 00:39:56,057
I think
it's the Apocalypse.

976
00:39:56,382 --> 00:39:57,610
What?

977
00:39:59,222 --> 00:40:03,501
I'm serious, boys. It's all in here,
in the Book of Revelations.

978
00:40:03,583 --> 00:40:04,538
You took my Bible?

979
00:40:04,623 --> 00:40:05,612
Well, just hear me out,

980
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:06,931
and you tell me that
what I'm describing

981
00:40:07,023 --> 00:40:09,776
isn't what's
going on right now.

982
00:40:10,183 --> 00:40:13,539
"And the skies shall open up, and the
light of the Lord shall shine down,

983
00:40:13,623 --> 00:40:16,377
"and those of good heart shall be brought
into my kingdom of heaven. "

984
00:40:16,464 --> 00:40:20,855
That's the Rapture, those are the gigantic
beams of blue light.

985
00:40:20,944 --> 00:40:23,253
"And there will be a great
mountain burning in fire. "

986
00:40:23,344 --> 00:40:26,780
I mean, the Hollywood Hills are literally
engulfed in flames

987
00:40:26,864 --> 00:40:28,264
as we sit here right now.

988
00:40:28,345 --> 00:40:30,905
The Hollywood Hills ain't no mountain.
It's a hill.

989
00:40:30,985 --> 00:40:32,179
Takes about 10 minutes
to get across

990
00:40:32,265 --> 00:40:33,414
that motherfucker
with no traffic.

991
00:40:33,505 --> 00:40:34,699
Coldwater.
I take Laurel Canyon.

992
00:40:34,785 --> 00:40:35,740
Cahuenga.
Cahuenga.

993
00:40:35,825 --> 00:40:37,701
I usually zip down Barham.
Boys, can I just fucking finish?

994
00:40:37,784 --> 00:40:39,058
I love Laurel Canyon.

995
00:40:39,184 --> 00:40:42,973
"And out of the pit rose a great
red dragon having seven heads,

996
00:40:43,105 --> 00:40:45,824
"that old serpent
called the devil and Satan,

997
00:40:45,905 --> 00:40:48,783
"which deceiveth
the whole world,

998
00:40:48,865 --> 00:40:51,425
"was released
onto the earth. "

999
00:40:52,305 --> 00:40:54,695
I love that dude. He's from
Where the Wild Things Are.

1000
00:40:54,826 --> 00:40:55,815
It's a load of bullshit.

1001
00:40:55,906 --> 00:40:56,941
It's not bullshit.

1002
00:40:57,026 --> 00:40:58,300
Want to know
something else, Jay?

1003
00:40:58,386 --> 00:40:59,455
If this is
the end of the world,

1004
00:40:59,546 --> 00:41:01,138
and all the
good people died,

1005
00:41:01,226 --> 00:41:05,425
what you're saying is Seth,
me, Jonah, Craig and Danny

1006
00:41:05,547 --> 00:41:06,536
are a bunch of assholes.

1007
00:41:06,627 --> 00:41:08,777
I'm straight-up
lovable, son.

1008
00:41:08,867 --> 00:41:12,621
And if this really
is the Apocalypse,

1009
00:41:12,707 --> 00:41:13,742
you're here, too.

1010
00:41:14,387 --> 00:41:17,698
So, that means you're just
as shitty as the rest of us.

1011
00:41:18,588 --> 00:41:19,907
Doesn't feel
too good, does it?

1012
00:41:30,388 --> 00:41:32,982
Hey, guys.
I'm going to sleep now.

1013
00:41:33,068 --> 00:41:34,421
Nobody come in here
and bother me.

1014
00:41:35,068 --> 00:41:36,057
Go fish.

1015
00:41:36,148 --> 00:41:37,820
Put it back
inside of here.

1016
00:41:37,908 --> 00:41:39,819
Do you know what it is? Yeah.

1017
00:41:39,908 --> 00:41:42,103
Now you ask me for
something that you need.

1018
00:41:42,188 --> 00:41:43,588
First bit.

1019
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:44,983
You're not cutting it all?

1020
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:47,788
That's smart. You're
divvying it up first.

1021
00:41:48,069 --> 00:41:49,900
This is like, Fruyere
or some shit. That's me.

1022
00:41:49,989 --> 00:41:51,024
Come on, Danny!

1023
00:41:51,069 --> 00:41:52,422
You licked your finger. Come on, man.

1024
00:41:53,349 --> 00:41:54,668
If they're all equal,
what does it matter?

1025
00:41:54,749 --> 00:41:56,103
Keep your hands
and fingers off.

1026
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:57,145
Seth?
Yeah.

1027
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:58,948
Can I talk to you for
a second? Yeah, yeah.

1028
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:00,429
Yeah, no shit.

1029
00:42:03,109 --> 00:42:05,304
Here.
Off the menu, my man.

1030
00:42:06,589 --> 00:42:08,660
Holy shit, man.
Where did you get these?

1031
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:12,265
Hey, what's cheese without a few
crackers? Know what I'm saying?

1032
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:14,227
Hide it.
Okay.

1033
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:17,863
'Cause we're a team.

1034
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:19,019
Okay.

1035
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:20,988
Freaks forever, brother.

1036
00:42:22,311 --> 00:42:24,267
Let's do all the drugs.

1037
00:42:24,351 --> 00:42:26,182
I don't really want to.

1038
00:42:26,271 --> 00:42:28,501
Should have thought of that before
you drank a can full of ecstasy.

1039
00:42:29,711 --> 00:42:30,780
What?

1040
00:42:32,952 --> 00:42:34,271
# Gangnam style

1041
00:42:35,752 --> 00:42:39,347
# Op, op, op, op, oppan
Gangnam style

1042
00:42:41,912 --> 00:42:42,867
# Gangnam style

1043
00:42:42,952 --> 00:42:46,581
# Op, op, op, op, oppan
Gangnam style

1044
00:42:46,672 --> 00:42:48,424
# Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh

1045
00:42:48,512 --> 00:42:51,868
# Eh, sexy lady

1046
00:42:51,952 --> 00:42:53,783
# Op, op, op, op

1047
00:42:53,872 --> 00:42:56,102
# Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh

1048
00:42:56,192 --> 00:42:57,308
# Oppan Gangnam style #

1049
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:08,552
# I fly like paper,
get high like planes

1050
00:43:08,673 --> 00:43:11,108
# If you catch me at the border
I got visas in my name

1051
00:43:11,194 --> 00:43:14,311
# If you come around here,
I make 'em all day

1052
00:43:14,394 --> 00:43:16,624
# I get one down
in a second if you wait...

1053
00:43:18,154 --> 00:43:20,429
Should we call Red?
Get more weed?

1054
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:23,268
Oh, I don't know, man.
That guy's gone crazy.

1055
00:43:23,355 --> 00:43:27,587
Good thing I have a lot of
fucking weed for you guys.

1056
00:43:27,675 --> 00:43:29,904
I hooked you guys up.

1057
00:43:29,994 --> 00:43:33,873
Now I need you guys to assassinate
Woody Harrelson.

1058
00:43:34,154 --> 00:43:36,589
If pot's legalized,
my business will suffer.

1059
00:43:36,675 --> 00:43:38,984
And if my business suffers,
I suffer.

1060
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:40,144
So much suffering.

1061
00:43:40,235 --> 00:43:43,068
All 'cause of that inbred hemp seed,
Woody Harrelson.

1062
00:43:43,155 --> 00:43:44,986
I have to do
what's right.

1063
00:43:45,075 --> 00:43:47,510
Weed is for the people.
It's the people's weed.

1064
00:43:47,956 --> 00:43:49,787
If you don't assassinate him...
We already quit.

1065
00:43:49,876 --> 00:43:52,390
...I'm gonna assassinate
both of you.

1066
00:43:53,356 --> 00:43:54,789
Run!
Go!

1067
00:43:57,276 --> 00:43:58,629
# And take your money

1068
00:43:58,716 --> 00:44:01,072
# All I wanna do is... #

1069
00:44:01,157 --> 00:44:04,035
B.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.
forever.

1070
00:44:04,117 --> 00:44:05,391
B.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.

1071
00:44:11,316 --> 00:44:12,670
Look out!
Shit!

1072
00:44:13,637 --> 00:44:15,753
You're letting them
get away!

1073
00:44:20,557 --> 00:44:22,946
I smoked weed
with Steve Jobs,

1074
00:44:23,037 --> 00:44:25,268
and that's when he came up
with the iPad.

1075
00:44:25,878 --> 00:44:27,550
It's pretty great.

1076
00:44:27,638 --> 00:44:29,356
We should make sequels
to more of our movies.

1077
00:44:29,438 --> 00:44:30,473
Yeah!

1078
00:44:30,558 --> 00:44:32,150
How 'bout we not
do Your Highness 2?

1079
00:44:32,238 --> 00:44:33,751
Yeah.
Do 128 Hours.

1080
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:36,147
The beginning of the rest of
your comedies. Looks good.

1081
00:44:39,999 --> 00:44:41,432
Oh, my God!

1082
00:44:48,919 --> 00:44:50,194
Emma!
It's Emma.

1083
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,794
Oh, my God,
you guys are alive.

1084
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,154
You're actually alive.
Thank God!

1085
00:44:55,239 --> 00:44:57,992
I hid in a drainpipe
for days.

1086
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:00,957
Like, three or four.
I don't even know how many.

1087
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:02,519
And then I stopped
hearing people,

1088
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,272
and I started hearing
growling noises.

1089
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:07,750
Out there,
in your travels, uh,

1090
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,114
did you see anything
that you would describe

1091
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,713
as Apocalyptish?

1092
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,518
I mean, no,

1093
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:17,396
but, uh, I would say it's completely
obvious what's going on here.

1094
00:45:17,521 --> 00:45:20,035
I mean,
it's a zombie invasion.

1095
00:45:20,121 --> 00:45:21,759
Fuck! I'm the one who
said it's been zombies.

1096
00:45:21,881 --> 00:45:23,599
You said zombies?
I said zombies the whole time.

1097
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:25,951
You said zombies? I don't think...
You never said zombies.

1098
00:45:26,041 --> 00:45:28,078
Wait a second.
You guys haven't been proven right.

1099
00:45:28,162 --> 00:45:29,390
These are still
just theories.

1100
00:45:29,482 --> 00:45:32,042
Honestly, I'm just so relieved
that you guys are here,

1101
00:45:32,122 --> 00:45:35,159
and I'm very happy about the
idea of sleeping and just...

1102
00:45:35,242 --> 00:45:36,231
You tired?
Yeah.

1103
00:45:36,322 --> 00:45:39,074
If you want to
take a little rest,

1104
00:45:39,161 --> 00:45:41,153
you're welcome to
do that upstairs.

1105
00:45:41,242 --> 00:45:42,516
Thank you.
Cool.

1106
00:45:42,602 --> 00:45:44,160
- I'll show you the way.
- Thank you.

1107
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:46,153
Thanks, guys. Seriously,
you're awesome, really.

1108
00:45:46,242 --> 00:45:47,800
You're awesome.

1109
00:45:48,442 --> 00:45:49,636
So fucking tight.

1110
00:45:49,762 --> 00:45:51,992
We'll be
right out here, okay?

1111
00:45:53,483 --> 00:45:54,552
Fuck are you guys
doing out here?

1112
00:45:54,683 --> 00:45:56,878
Here's what I think we should do.
She's British, right?

1113
00:45:56,963 --> 00:45:58,681
She's used to eating
shitty food anyway.

1114
00:45:58,763 --> 00:46:00,640
Let's just give her all the shitty food
that we don't want.

1115
00:46:00,723 --> 00:46:02,236
That's fucked up.
Look how tiny she is.

1116
00:46:02,323 --> 00:46:04,234
She's not even a full seven.
She's, like, half a seven.

1117
00:46:04,323 --> 00:46:05,598
This is a fucking
cool thing, man.

1118
00:46:05,684 --> 00:46:07,003
I, for one,
am very excited.

1119
00:46:07,084 --> 00:46:08,915
I'm a massive
Harry Potterfan.

1120
00:46:09,004 --> 00:46:11,074
What? Yes. I love
fucking Harry Potter.

1121
00:46:11,164 --> 00:46:12,597
I cannot wait
till she wakes up

1122
00:46:12,684 --> 00:46:14,356
and I can ask her all these amazing
questions about

1123
00:46:14,444 --> 00:46:15,638
how they made
those motion pictures.

1124
00:46:15,724 --> 00:46:16,759
Take it easy, Dumbledore.

1125
00:46:16,844 --> 00:46:19,723
Guys, listen, listen.
I think we need to

1126
00:46:19,804 --> 00:46:21,522
address the elephant
in the room.

1127
00:46:21,604 --> 00:46:23,356
Whoa. Jay, don't talk
about Craig like that.

1128
00:46:23,444 --> 00:46:25,002
That's fucked up.
I'm right here, man. Yeah.

1129
00:46:25,084 --> 00:46:27,200
I'm not calling
Craig an elephant.

1130
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:29,275
Wow, that's fucking weird.
What does that even mean?

1131
00:46:29,364 --> 00:46:30,593
Yeah, no.
That's racist.

1132
00:46:30,685 --> 00:46:31,800
I wasn't
referring to him.

1133
00:46:31,885 --> 00:46:35,275
I was referring to the issue
that's on all of our minds.

1134
00:46:35,365 --> 00:46:36,639
What?

1135
00:46:36,725 --> 00:46:40,035
This is one girl
in a house with six males.

1136
00:46:40,125 --> 00:46:41,274
Yeah. Really safe.

1137
00:46:41,365 --> 00:46:42,481
Ideal scenario.

1138
00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:43,635
She's like
a little sister.

1139
00:46:43,726 --> 00:46:45,159
I think that
she needs...

1140
00:46:45,246 --> 00:46:46,964
It's important
that she feels safe.

1141
00:46:47,046 --> 00:46:48,525
Yeah.
And comfortable.

1142
00:46:48,606 --> 00:46:49,959
And we should
be mindful.

1143
00:46:50,046 --> 00:46:51,365
Who's making her
not feel safe?

1144
00:46:51,446 --> 00:46:52,879
Well, I'm just saying,
we should...

1145
00:46:52,966 --> 00:46:55,322
We don't want to
give off a bad vibe.

1146
00:46:55,407 --> 00:46:56,920
Vibe? Vibes? I ain't giving no vibes.

1147
00:46:57,007 --> 00:46:58,645
Yeah, wait, what kind of vibes
are you talking about, man?

1148
00:46:58,727 --> 00:47:00,604
He's talking about us
giving off a rapey vibe.

1149
00:47:00,687 --> 00:47:02,279
Hey! Shh!
Whoa! What?

1150
00:47:02,407 --> 00:47:04,203
Jesus. Jay, what the fuck, man?

1151
00:47:04,286 --> 00:47:05,435
Chill out, dude.

1152
00:47:05,526 --> 00:47:07,404
Why you putting that
shit in the mix? Yeah.

1153
00:47:07,487 --> 00:47:09,239
He fucking said it.
You're the one saying it.

1154
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:10,726
No one here is thinking
about raping anyone.

1155
00:47:10,807 --> 00:47:12,445
Shh!
Well, you talking about vibes

1156
00:47:12,527 --> 00:47:15,360
is the only thing that's rapey
going on right now.

1157
00:47:15,447 --> 00:47:17,358
Dude, nothing was rapey
till you brought up the rapey vibes.

1158
00:47:17,447 --> 00:47:19,438
Fucking one who smelt it dealt it, dawg.
True that, dude.

1159
00:47:19,528 --> 00:47:20,927
One who denies it
supplies it.

1160
00:47:21,008 --> 00:47:22,999
I know,
it's farts, I get it.

1161
00:47:23,088 --> 00:47:24,237
Guys, guys, guys.

1162
00:47:24,328 --> 00:47:25,920
Jay's not rapey.

1163
00:47:26,368 --> 00:47:27,437
Jay couldn't rape a fly.

1164
00:47:27,528 --> 00:47:29,246
He probably could.

1165
00:47:29,368 --> 00:47:31,199
Maybe we should just stop this entire
conversation right now.

1166
00:47:31,328 --> 00:47:33,001
If anyone's gonna
rape anyone here,

1167
00:47:33,089 --> 00:47:34,408
it's probably
gonna be Danny.

1168
00:47:34,489 --> 00:47:35,888
What the fuck, Franco?
What?

1169
00:47:35,969 --> 00:47:37,368
Why do you think
I'm gonna rape somebody?

1170
00:47:37,449 --> 00:47:39,326
I'm just trying
to lay it out there.

1171
00:47:39,409 --> 00:47:40,762
I'm not gonna
rape anyone, all right?

1172
00:47:40,849 --> 00:47:42,123
If anyone's gonna
rape somebody, it's Jay.

1173
00:47:42,169 --> 00:47:43,761
- What?
- He came up with the rape idea.

1174
00:47:43,849 --> 00:47:45,044
And his face looks
like the police sketch

1175
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:46,244
of a fucking rapist.
True.

1176
00:47:46,329 --> 00:47:47,523
What the fuck
does that mean?

1177
00:47:47,609 --> 00:47:49,201
If anybody's
raping Emma Watson,

1178
00:47:49,289 --> 00:47:50,404
it's fucking
Sir Rapes-a-Lot over here.

1179
00:47:50,529 --> 00:47:51,598
Chill out.
Hey!

1180
00:47:51,849 --> 00:47:52,964
Whoa!

1181
00:47:53,049 --> 00:47:54,038
Easy. Easy.

1182
00:47:54,129 --> 00:47:55,198
Back the fuck up!

1183
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:56,563
Emma.
What's wrong?

1184
00:47:56,649 --> 00:47:57,719
Wait, what's wrong?
What's wrong?

1185
00:47:57,810 --> 00:47:58,925
I just heard
you guys talking about

1186
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:00,489
which one of you is
gonna get to rape me.

1187
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:01,969
No, no, no, no!

1188
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:03,483
Guys, I got it.
I got it.

1189
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:05,840
No. It's funny.
It's funny.

1190
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:07,807
We were specifically
talking about not raping you.

1191
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:10,246
Jesus!
Holy shit!

1192
00:48:10,331 --> 00:48:12,083
Back up!

1193
00:48:12,651 --> 00:48:14,130
It's me, Jonah!

1194
00:48:14,211 --> 00:48:15,690
It's me, Jonah Hill.

1195
00:48:15,771 --> 00:48:18,331
America's sweetheart.
J - bug, J - bone.

1196
00:48:18,451 --> 00:48:19,964
Your friend. I would never hurt you.
Get back!

1197
00:48:21,891 --> 00:48:23,883
Give me everything you have to drink!
Put it in the bag!

1198
00:48:23,972 --> 00:48:25,769
There's six of us.
You cannot rob us!

1199
00:48:25,852 --> 00:48:27,080
I'm not fucking around!

1200
00:48:28,371 --> 00:48:29,850
Give her drinks!
Give her drinks!

1201
00:48:29,971 --> 00:48:31,324
Put the drinks in a bag!

1202
00:48:31,371 --> 00:48:33,441
Oh, God.
Get all the drinks in a bag!

1203
00:48:33,531 --> 00:48:34,851
Hurry the fuck up!

1204
00:48:34,932 --> 00:48:36,126
Okay, they're getting
the drinks.

1205
00:48:36,212 --> 00:48:38,248
Put the ax down.
Don't give the Milky Way away.

1206
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:40,243
All right, you can put
the ax down now.

1207
00:48:40,332 --> 00:48:41,401
Now, Franco!
Shoot her face!

1208
00:48:41,492 --> 00:48:42,607
Shoot her!

1209
00:48:42,692 --> 00:48:44,250
I'm not gonna
shoot Emma Watson!

1210
00:48:44,332 --> 00:48:45,970
Look, Emma, just stay here
with us.

1211
00:48:46,052 --> 00:48:47,691
It's a lot safer
than out there.

1212
00:48:53,813 --> 00:48:56,281
Hermione just stole
all of our shit.

1213
00:48:56,373 --> 00:49:00,049
Little bitty-ass
20-year-old jacked us.

1214
00:49:00,134 --> 00:49:03,444
And then Jay suggested that we all rape her,
and now she's gone.

1215
00:49:03,534 --> 00:49:05,843
I didn't...
I was just... I...

1216
00:49:05,934 --> 00:49:09,051
I think the only reason why he
did that is because Jay knows

1217
00:49:09,134 --> 00:49:10,533
he's about fucking
two minutes away

1218
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:12,206
from becoming
the house bitch himself.

1219
00:49:12,294 --> 00:49:16,207
So now,
motherfuckers is thirsty.

1220
00:49:16,574 --> 00:49:18,292
All right, guys.

1221
00:49:18,374 --> 00:49:20,126
The door to the
basement's out there,

1222
00:49:20,214 --> 00:49:21,613
around the side
of the house.

1223
00:49:21,734 --> 00:49:25,011
I know for sure there's at least
two jugs of water.

1224
00:49:25,095 --> 00:49:26,574
Okay.

1225
00:49:26,655 --> 00:49:27,644
Uh...

1226
00:49:28,535 --> 00:49:29,809
Any volunteers?

1227
00:49:29,895 --> 00:49:31,248
Does anyone want to volunteer
and go with Jay?

1228
00:49:31,775 --> 00:49:32,810
What?

1229
00:49:32,895 --> 00:49:34,806
I thought you said, "Someone volunteer
to go with me out there. "

1230
00:49:34,895 --> 00:49:35,884
I must have
misheard you.

1231
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:37,927
I'm sorry. You did
not, you motherfucker.

1232
00:49:38,016 --> 00:49:39,415
Hey, okay, ease up.

1233
00:49:39,496 --> 00:49:42,056
Just chill out, dude.
Just relax, man. God.

1234
00:49:42,136 --> 00:49:43,967
So how we gonna
decide this, fellas?

1235
00:49:44,056 --> 00:49:46,445
All right, guys, it's simple.

1236
00:49:46,536 --> 00:49:49,927
Whoever pulls the burnt match
has to go get the water.

1237
00:49:58,176 --> 00:50:01,088
Who wants to go first?

1238
00:50:02,137 --> 00:50:03,365
I'll do it.

1239
00:50:03,457 --> 00:50:04,572
Craig.

1240
00:50:04,697 --> 00:50:06,255
All right.

1241
00:50:07,257 --> 00:50:08,690
Go ahead, brother.

1242
00:50:15,538 --> 00:50:16,937
No whammies, no whammies.

1243
00:50:17,018 --> 00:50:19,771
- Hey, hey.
- Yes! Yeah!

1244
00:50:19,858 --> 00:50:21,689
Fuck, yes!
Yes!

1245
00:50:21,818 --> 00:50:23,934
- Whoo!
- Fuck, yes. Fuck, yes.

1246
00:50:24,018 --> 00:50:26,054
So sorry, Craig.
A lot of guys in here

1247
00:50:26,178 --> 00:50:27,453
that I wish it was
instead of you.

1248
00:50:28,899 --> 00:50:30,651
You want to go
best two out of three?

1249
00:50:30,739 --> 00:50:34,254
If I tug, if I pull in any way,
or if you hear me screaming,

1250
00:50:34,339 --> 00:50:36,727
anything, you pull me
right back in, all right?

1251
00:50:36,818 --> 00:50:38,649
Yeah. We'll try, man,
but you're pretty heavy.

1252
00:50:39,299 --> 00:50:40,448
What?

1253
00:50:40,539 --> 00:50:43,292
No, I mean, I'm saying,
I just don't think it's smart

1254
00:50:43,379 --> 00:50:44,812
to make any guarantees.
Fuck, no.

1255
00:50:44,899 --> 00:50:46,571
You promise to pull me
back in. No, no, we're...

1256
00:50:46,699 --> 00:50:47,768
You got me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1257
00:50:47,859 --> 00:50:49,212
We're gonna do our best.
All right.

1258
00:50:49,299 --> 00:50:50,891
You want to do a test run? Yeah.

1259
00:50:50,979 --> 00:50:52,413
You gotta scream.
Let us hear the scream.

1260
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:54,259
Pull.

1261
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:55,773
Nice. Very nice.

1262
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:56,975
Everyone thank Craig
for doing this.

1263
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:58,812
Thanks, Craig.
Thank you, Craig.

1264
00:50:58,900 --> 00:50:59,889
Go for it, Craig.

1265
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:01,971
Getting smoky in here.
Go, go, go, go.

1266
00:51:05,621 --> 00:51:07,339
This is fucked up.

1267
00:51:18,022 --> 00:51:19,852
Goddamn.

1268
00:51:19,941 --> 00:51:21,932
Smoky as fuck out here.

1269
00:51:40,862 --> 00:51:41,898
Rope burn!
Ah! Ooh!

1270
00:51:41,983 --> 00:51:43,655
Grab it, grab it,
grab it!

1271
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:44,971
Oh, no, no, no, no!

1272
00:51:45,063 --> 00:51:46,098
Shit.
Oh, no.

1273
00:51:46,223 --> 00:51:48,214
Shit. Shit.

1274
00:51:56,904 --> 00:51:58,178
Come on, motherfucker.
Shit!

1275
00:52:01,264 --> 00:52:02,742
Fuck this shit.

1276
00:52:08,704 --> 00:52:11,502
Fellas, fellas! Pull
me in! Pull the rope!

1277
00:52:11,624 --> 00:52:13,182
Pull me in! We don't
have the rope anymore!

1278
00:52:13,264 --> 00:52:14,583
We fucking dropped it!
We're sorry!

1279
00:52:14,664 --> 00:52:15,813
You've got
the rope, man!

1280
00:52:15,904 --> 00:52:17,223
What?

1281
00:52:22,785 --> 00:52:24,457
Craig! What the fuck do we do?

1282
00:52:24,545 --> 00:52:26,297
Craig! Craig!

1283
00:52:28,065 --> 00:52:29,054
Are you okay?

1284
00:52:29,145 --> 00:52:30,180
What happened, man?

1285
00:52:30,265 --> 00:52:31,745
I don't know! There's
something out there.

1286
00:52:35,626 --> 00:52:36,775
Oh, shit!

1287
00:52:39,946 --> 00:52:41,982
A knife!
Somebody throw me a knife!

1288
00:52:42,066 --> 00:52:43,340
I'll get it.

1289
00:52:47,026 --> 00:52:49,256
Why?
OMG.

1290
00:52:49,346 --> 00:52:50,859
Jay, I'm so sorry, bro.

1291
00:52:50,946 --> 00:52:51,935
The fuck?

1292
00:52:53,786 --> 00:52:55,265
Cut it! Cut it!
Cut it! Cut it! Cut it!

1293
00:52:56,627 --> 00:52:59,141
God! What the fuck
was that?

1294
00:52:59,227 --> 00:53:00,342
I don't know what
the fuck that was,

1295
00:53:00,467 --> 00:53:01,582
but I ain't
going back out there.

1296
00:53:01,667 --> 00:53:02,736
Craig, you didn't even
get any of the water.

1297
00:53:02,827 --> 00:53:03,816
The door was fucked up.

1298
00:53:03,907 --> 00:53:06,057
Damn it,
this is so frustrating!

1299
00:53:06,147 --> 00:53:08,422
It's so close,
but so far.

1300
00:53:08,507 --> 00:53:11,580
The water, it's, like,
right underneath us.

1301
00:53:11,668 --> 00:53:13,306
Like, right there.

1302
00:53:13,388 --> 00:53:16,141
What do you mean
"right underneath us"?

1303
00:53:16,228 --> 00:53:19,504
Like, literally,
like, right there.

1304
00:53:19,588 --> 00:53:21,226
If you went right
through the floor.

1305
00:53:33,428 --> 00:53:34,862
Yo.

1306
00:53:34,949 --> 00:53:39,340
Danny and Jonah's shift ends in ten
minutes, so our break is almost over.

1307
00:53:39,949 --> 00:53:41,348
Okay.

1308
00:53:41,589 --> 00:53:42,817
Let me ask you something.

1309
00:53:44,349 --> 00:53:46,818
You really think this is

1310
00:53:46,910 --> 00:53:48,389
the Apocalypse?

1311
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:50,938
You saw something
out there, didn't you?

1312
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:56,468
All right, let's just say for
sake of argument, what if I did?

1313
00:53:56,550 --> 00:53:58,666
What if this is the real
shit, right now, happening?

1314
00:53:59,671 --> 00:54:02,139
What if it is, man? We're
not prepared for this.

1315
00:54:02,271 --> 00:54:04,182
What do we do? What's
next? It says in the Bible,

1316
00:54:04,271 --> 00:54:06,182
"The worthy will
ascend to Heaven. "

1317
00:54:06,271 --> 00:54:11,469
Even if it is the Apocalypse,
it's not the end of us.

1318
00:54:11,551 --> 00:54:13,109
There's still hope.

1319
00:54:13,191 --> 00:54:16,422
We just have to somehow try
to prove our worthiness.

1320
00:54:16,511 --> 00:54:18,786
Okay, so, you mean, like,

1321
00:54:18,871 --> 00:54:22,307
like the Ten Commandments,
like, do shit unto people

1322
00:54:22,391 --> 00:54:23,619
that'll do
the same shit to you.

1323
00:54:23,711 --> 00:54:25,430
That's a great
place to start.

1324
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:26,911
You know,
to just overall love.

1325
00:54:26,992 --> 00:54:30,064
Just be nicer and follow those
commandments.

1326
00:54:30,152 --> 00:54:32,461
Listen. We're gonna
get through this.

1327
00:54:32,552 --> 00:54:33,826
We're gonna get
through this, man.

1328
00:54:33,912 --> 00:54:36,586
You know why?
'Cause we're gonna do it together.

1329
00:54:36,673 --> 00:54:37,867
You promise?

1330
00:54:37,953 --> 00:54:39,227
We're gonna do this.

1331
00:54:40,913 --> 00:54:42,983
I hear everything.

1332
00:54:53,114 --> 00:54:56,466
Who did this?

1333
00:54:56,553 --> 00:54:58,783
Did what?
What are you talking about?

1334
00:54:58,873 --> 00:55:01,467
Jizzed all over the pages
of this nice magazine

1335
00:55:01,594 --> 00:55:03,505
I was nice enough
to tell you about.

1336
00:55:03,594 --> 00:55:05,232
Was it you, Seth?

1337
00:55:05,314 --> 00:55:06,463
No.

1338
00:55:06,554 --> 00:55:07,953
No?
It was me, Franco.

1339
00:55:08,034 --> 00:55:10,150
I fucking made jizz
in your magazine.

1340
00:55:10,234 --> 00:55:12,031
Why?
When I fucking jack off

1341
00:55:12,114 --> 00:55:13,832
long enough,
I end up jizzing, dude.

1342
00:55:13,914 --> 00:55:16,475
I'm assuming the same shit
works for you?

1343
00:55:16,555 --> 00:55:19,194
Real fucking smart answer!
Why don't you fucking aim, huh?

1344
00:55:19,275 --> 00:55:22,472
I have a particularly explosive ejaculate.
It just goes everywhere.

1345
00:55:22,555 --> 00:55:24,432
It's like a fucking
wild fireman's hose.

1346
00:55:24,515 --> 00:55:26,073
You just got to grab on
and pray to God

1347
00:55:26,155 --> 00:55:27,475
it doesn't get in your eyes
or your mouth.

1348
00:55:27,556 --> 00:55:29,194
The fuck kind of
jerking off is that?

1349
00:55:29,276 --> 00:55:30,265
What, you never had
any brothers?

1350
00:55:30,356 --> 00:55:32,950
You didn't learn to jizz in a fucking
sock or on a fucking tissue?

1351
00:55:33,036 --> 00:55:34,788
No, I don't have
any brothers.

1352
00:55:34,876 --> 00:55:36,308
I was raised
in a house of women!

1353
00:55:36,395 --> 00:55:38,147
I highly doubt
they fucking taught you

1354
00:55:38,235 --> 00:55:40,875
to fucking close your eyes and
fucking cum wherever you want!

1355
00:55:40,956 --> 00:55:41,991
I mean, you're getting
all worked up

1356
00:55:42,076 --> 00:55:43,634
over a fucking
porno mag!

1357
00:55:43,716 --> 00:55:45,946
Who has goddamn
porno mags anymore?

1358
00:55:46,036 --> 00:55:48,345
Welcome to the 21 st century,
Buck Rogers!

1359
00:55:48,476 --> 00:55:51,274
You designed a house with
fucking iPads in the walls,

1360
00:55:51,396 --> 00:55:53,786
yet you're jerking your dick like
a goddamn pilgrim!

1361
00:55:53,877 --> 00:55:56,391
That's right, man.
I like to fucking read!

1362
00:55:56,477 --> 00:55:58,513
You think that's the only thing
I jerked off in here?

1363
00:55:58,597 --> 00:56:00,508
I've been dropping loads around
this fucking house

1364
00:56:00,597 --> 00:56:01,791
like a goddamn
dump truck.

1365
00:56:01,877 --> 00:56:03,356
You don't
cum on my stuff!

1366
00:56:03,437 --> 00:56:05,030
I'll cum wherever
the fuck I want, James.

1367
00:56:05,118 --> 00:56:06,392
I'll fucking cum
in your kitchen.

1368
00:56:06,478 --> 00:56:07,672
I'll cum on
your fucking art.

1369
00:56:07,758 --> 00:56:09,316
I'll cum anywhere
I want!

1370
00:56:09,398 --> 00:56:11,070
I will fucking cum
right on you!

1371
00:56:11,158 --> 00:56:13,513
I will cum like a fucking
madman all over you, McBride!

1372
00:56:13,598 --> 00:56:16,351
Ooh. I fucking wish you'd
cum on me right now.

1373
00:56:16,439 --> 00:56:17,792
I fucking dare you
to cum on me!

1374
00:56:17,879 --> 00:56:20,267
God!

1375
00:56:20,358 --> 00:56:22,553
I'm gonna jack my dick
so fucking hard in here!

1376
00:56:22,678 --> 00:56:25,192
This, no more, man.
All over your fucking face.

1377
00:56:25,278 --> 00:56:27,314
This fucking all more.
All over the fucking place!

1378
00:56:27,398 --> 00:56:29,037
I'll fucking cum
anywhere I want!

1379
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:30,438
I'll fucking cum
on these walls!

1380
00:56:30,519 --> 00:56:31,998
I'll cum on
the fucking cabinets!

1381
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:33,637
On the fucking furniture!
I'll cum everywhere!

1382
00:56:33,719 --> 00:56:35,471
If I see your dick
one more time,

1383
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:36,912
I'm gonna fucking
shoot it off!

1384
00:56:36,999 --> 00:56:38,796
You don't have
enough bullets, bitch.

1385
00:56:38,879 --> 00:56:41,394
No fucking jerking off
in my house, McBride!

1386
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:46,158
Come on, man.
Fuck this.

1387
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,878
I'm just... I'm too thirsty to do this.

1388
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,194
And the fucking
bitter irony is

1389
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,475
I'm not gonna have my thirst
quenched until I finish this.

1390
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:53,073
God damn it, I hate it. Danny, no.

1391
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:54,560
Don't walk away. Danny,
don't walk away from me!

1392
00:56:54,641 --> 00:56:57,678
It's too late, Seth. I've
already walked away too much.

1393
00:56:57,801 --> 00:56:59,519
No, you haven't. You
could still come back

1394
00:56:59,601 --> 00:57:02,160
and just fucking turn around
and come back and help me.

1395
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:05,354
Danny?

1396
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:07,275
Daniel?

1397
00:57:16,561 --> 00:57:17,880
Need a hand?

1398
00:57:18,481 --> 00:57:19,756
Yeah, dude.

1399
00:57:19,842 --> 00:57:20,797
Your shift
just ended, man.

1400
00:57:20,882 --> 00:57:22,281
You don't have to help me
if you don't want to.

1401
00:57:22,362 --> 00:57:23,511
It's fine, I get it.

1402
00:57:23,602 --> 00:57:25,354
The fuck else
am I doing?

1403
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:27,558
I appreciate it, man.
Thank you.

1404
00:57:27,642 --> 00:57:29,075
Done and done.
That's cool.

1405
00:57:35,403 --> 00:57:37,963
I don't know why I'm thinking
of this, but remember that time

1406
00:57:38,043 --> 00:57:41,831
that I got you a fucking
Taco Bell gift certificate

1407
00:57:41,923 --> 00:57:43,595
for, like, 20 bucks,
and I bet you

1408
00:57:43,723 --> 00:57:45,679
that you couldn't eat
all of that in one sitting.

1409
00:57:45,763 --> 00:57:47,515
I do remember that.
I remember thinking,

1410
00:57:47,643 --> 00:57:48,837
"How much food
could 20 dollars

1411
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:50,276
"possibly buy you
at Taco Bell?"

1412
00:57:50,363 --> 00:57:51,796
And the answer is infinite.

1413
00:57:51,883 --> 00:57:53,874
And we went to see
fucking Gladiator.

1414
00:57:53,963 --> 00:57:54,998
Yeah.

1415
00:57:55,083 --> 00:57:57,518
And you sharted midway
through the movie.

1416
00:57:57,604 --> 00:57:59,242
I did. Due to the tigers' appearance.

1417
00:57:59,364 --> 00:58:00,877
I got scared of the tigers. Yeah.

1418
00:58:00,964 --> 00:58:02,443
Literally, when the second
tiger came out, I went...

1419
00:58:02,524 --> 00:58:03,877
...and then I shat.

1420
00:58:03,964 --> 00:58:05,283
I shat in the theater.

1421
00:58:12,285 --> 00:58:14,276
Jesus.
Oh, fuck.

1422
00:58:14,365 --> 00:58:15,764
You guys okay?

1423
00:58:15,845 --> 00:58:17,483
I broke my ass in half.
Here.

1424
00:58:17,565 --> 00:58:19,078
Shit, they got through!

1425
00:58:19,165 --> 00:58:21,361
You guys fucking did it.
Oh, my God.

1426
00:58:21,446 --> 00:58:22,435
Fuck. Did that hurt?

1427
00:58:22,526 --> 00:58:23,800
Oh, yes, it fucking hurt.

1428
00:58:23,886 --> 00:58:25,877
I loosened this up for you,
I'll have you know.

1429
00:58:25,966 --> 00:58:27,762
Okay, just shut up.
It's fucking dark down here.

1430
00:58:27,845 --> 00:58:30,279
Hold on, hold on.

1431
00:58:31,165 --> 00:58:32,234
Nice.

1432
00:58:32,365 --> 00:58:34,277
Okay, good.
Thank you. What is that?

1433
00:58:34,366 --> 00:58:37,039
That's Terrence Peterson.
My monkey flashlight keychain.

1434
00:58:37,166 --> 00:58:38,838
Monkey flashlight keychain?
Mmm-hmm.

1435
00:58:38,926 --> 00:58:40,484
What's his name?
Terrence Peterson.

1436
00:58:40,566 --> 00:58:41,965
You see it, Seth?
No. Where...

1437
00:58:42,046 --> 00:58:43,365
Are you sure
it's even down here?

1438
00:58:43,446 --> 00:58:44,481
Terry Pete.

1439
00:58:44,566 --> 00:58:45,885
Uh, not sure.

1440
00:58:45,966 --> 00:58:47,286
Is there, is there any
weird shit down here?

1441
00:58:47,367 --> 00:58:50,245
Nah, it's where I keep all my
stuff from my old movies.

1442
00:58:50,327 --> 00:58:51,555
Costumes, props.

1443
00:59:02,928 --> 00:59:04,486
What?
Is someone down there?

1444
00:59:04,568 --> 00:59:07,765
It's your fucking stupid
cutout from Spider-Man 3.

1445
00:59:07,848 --> 00:59:09,361
Jesus Christ.

1446
00:59:09,448 --> 00:59:10,482
No shit!

1447
00:59:10,607 --> 00:59:11,677
- There it is!
- Yes! Yeah!

1448
00:59:11,768 --> 00:59:13,679
What, did you find it?
Yeah!

1449
00:59:15,768 --> 00:59:17,247
# La-da-da-da-dah

1450
00:59:17,328 --> 00:59:19,319
# It's the motherfucking
D - O-double-G

1451
00:59:19,448 --> 00:59:20,767
# Snoop Dogg!

1452
00:59:20,848 --> 00:59:22,247
# La-da-da-da-dahh

1453
00:59:22,368 --> 00:59:24,564
# You know I'm mobbin'
with the D.R.E. #

1454
00:59:24,809 --> 00:59:25,924
Water.

1455
00:59:27,529 --> 00:59:29,087
Mmm!

1456
00:59:29,209 --> 00:59:31,279
That is so fucking good.

1457
00:59:31,369 --> 00:59:32,802
The two heroes over here,
breaking through the floor.

1458
00:59:32,889 --> 00:59:34,402
We did break
through the floor.

1459
00:59:34,489 --> 00:59:36,401
Any of you guys would
have done the same thing.

1460
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:38,799
Oh, man.
That fucking hurt.

1461
00:59:38,930 --> 00:59:41,046
Yeah, I'm surprised
you didn't shart again.

1462
00:59:41,130 --> 00:59:42,279
I think I did.

1463
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:44,201
Hey, what year is this? 19...

1464
00:59:44,290 --> 00:59:45,882
That's a good...
That's a good year.

1465
00:59:45,970 --> 00:59:47,244
Hey, hey.
Yo, yo, yo!

1466
00:59:47,330 --> 00:59:49,003
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

1467
00:59:49,091 --> 00:59:50,160
What am I doing?

1468
00:59:51,531 --> 00:59:52,964
Fuck, man.

1469
00:59:53,051 --> 00:59:54,961
I'm just pouring myself
another glass of water

1470
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:57,006
to wash down that dry-ass
Cinnamon Toast Crunch.

1471
00:59:57,090 --> 00:59:58,318
That's very nice,
but you can't just

1472
00:59:58,450 --> 01:00:00,042
pour yourself another
glass of water, man!

1473
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:01,200
Will you cut it out?

1474
01:00:01,291 --> 01:00:03,566
Yeah. We agreed to one
glass at dinner,

1475
01:00:03,651 --> 01:00:04,800
we voted on it, man.

1476
01:00:04,891 --> 01:00:06,119
Well, man, I'm just
getting sick and tired

1477
01:00:06,211 --> 01:00:07,564
of all these
fucking rules, man.

1478
01:00:07,651 --> 01:00:09,050
You don't see me putting rules
on you guys.

1479
01:00:09,131 --> 01:00:11,486
You cannot have
another glass of water.

1480
01:00:11,571 --> 01:00:13,607
Jay weighs 150 pounds
less than me.

1481
01:00:13,692 --> 01:00:15,569
Why the fuck is it fair

1482
01:00:15,652 --> 01:00:17,529
that him and I should drink
the same amount of water?

1483
01:00:17,612 --> 01:00:19,330
We should be
dividing our rations

1484
01:00:19,412 --> 01:00:21,289
based on our
proportionate size.

1485
01:00:21,372 --> 01:00:23,840
I don't want to come off
as a diva here or anything.

1486
01:00:23,932 --> 01:00:25,160
It's just that
I think everyone

1487
01:00:25,252 --> 01:00:26,527
should split
everything equally.

1488
01:00:26,613 --> 01:00:28,808
"I just think that everybody shoul
have the fucking same.

1489
01:00:28,893 --> 01:00:30,963
"I have a goddamn earring. "
Shut the fuck up, Jonah!

1490
01:00:31,053 --> 01:00:32,771
You know what, Danny?
If you weren't jizzing

1491
01:00:32,853 --> 01:00:34,684
all the time, maybe
you'd be more hydrated.

1492
01:00:34,773 --> 01:00:36,364
You're making me into a
joke right now, Franco,

1493
01:00:36,452 --> 01:00:38,249
and you are not gonna like
the fucking punch line.

1494
01:00:38,332 --> 01:00:41,245
No more jerking off! No more
water! Just sit the fuck down!

1495
01:00:41,333 --> 01:00:42,652
Okay, I'm done.

1496
01:00:42,733 --> 01:00:43,927
We're not gonna
have any more water.

1497
01:00:44,013 --> 01:00:45,002
Good.
All right.

1498
01:00:47,013 --> 01:00:48,605
Hey!

1499
01:00:55,854 --> 01:00:57,606
Someone help me!
Fucking grab it!

1500
01:01:00,374 --> 01:01:01,602
What are you doing?

1501
01:01:01,694 --> 01:01:02,683
You guys
made this happen!

1502
01:01:02,774 --> 01:01:05,243
You guys forced my fucking
hand by ganging up on me.

1503
01:01:05,335 --> 01:01:08,293
God damn it, I'm gonna
fucking kill this motherfucker!

1504
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:12,809
That's what I thought.
Nerd.

1505
01:01:17,576 --> 01:01:19,008
All right, guys,

1506
01:01:19,135 --> 01:01:20,250
let's get rid of him.

1507
01:01:20,335 --> 01:01:21,654
What?
What do you mean?

1508
01:01:21,735 --> 01:01:23,248
Like, kick him
out of the house?

1509
01:01:23,335 --> 01:01:26,088
His fucking reckless behavior
is dragging us all down.

1510
01:01:26,175 --> 01:01:28,166
I mean, he wasted
our water twice.

1511
01:01:28,295 --> 01:01:30,127
Two times. Two times.

1512
01:01:30,256 --> 01:01:32,724
Dan is under a lot
of pressure. Okay?

1513
01:01:32,816 --> 01:01:34,568
And he's not handling it as
good as the rest of us are.

1514
01:01:34,656 --> 01:01:37,375
Look at him. He's
wearing my fucking tuxedo.

1515
01:01:37,456 --> 01:01:39,048
He's been eating nonstop.

1516
01:01:39,136 --> 01:01:41,492
The fucker's gained weight
since he got here.

1517
01:01:41,577 --> 01:01:43,568
The fucker's got to go.

1518
01:01:43,657 --> 01:01:44,646
Go.

1519
01:01:44,737 --> 01:01:46,329
The fucker's got to go.

1520
01:01:50,857 --> 01:01:52,415
This is how you all feel?

1521
01:01:52,497 --> 01:01:53,772
We talked about it.

1522
01:01:53,858 --> 01:01:56,736
You guys are gonna
vote me off the island?

1523
01:01:56,818 --> 01:01:59,730
I mean, I made
you guys breakfast.

1524
01:01:59,818 --> 01:02:02,092
Shit, man, you wasted half
of our food when you did that.

1525
01:02:02,177 --> 01:02:04,896
Just thought I was doing
something nice for you guys.

1526
01:02:04,977 --> 01:02:08,254
Just to apologize for
my behavior at the party.

1527
01:02:08,378 --> 01:02:09,697
Party I wasn't
even invited to.

1528
01:02:10,018 --> 01:02:11,974
I'm not an idiot.

1529
01:02:12,458 --> 01:02:15,052
I know why you guys don't fucking
call me or hang out with me anymore.

1530
01:02:15,178 --> 01:02:18,215
It's because I party
so fucking hard.

1531
01:02:18,659 --> 01:02:21,696
Always have.
Ever since I was a baby.

1532
01:02:21,779 --> 01:02:23,497
I wouldn't just suck
on my mama's titties.

1533
01:02:23,579 --> 01:02:26,696
I would fucking bang 'em
and motorboat 'em.

1534
01:02:27,899 --> 01:02:31,415
Everything I've been doing
has just been a cry for help.

1535
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:34,298
When I came on
your magazine, James,

1536
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:36,336
it was a cum for help.

1537
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:40,208
I've just been crying and
comin' and crying and comin',

1538
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:43,130
tears from the tip
of my penis, dudes.

1539
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:46,172
I'm sorry, all right? You
can cum wherever you want.

1540
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:48,694
I don't even care about
cumming anymore.

1541
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:52,654
Right now, I'm just
kind of into going.

1542
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:55,492
Danny.
Danny.

1543
01:02:55,580 --> 01:02:56,650
Hey.
Come on, man.

1544
01:02:56,741 --> 01:02:58,254
I fucked up.

1545
01:02:58,341 --> 01:02:59,569
I'm sorry, man.
Come on, look,

1546
01:02:59,701 --> 01:03:01,373
I was wrong.
I feel like shit, man.

1547
01:03:01,461 --> 01:03:02,940
I didn't want it
to happen like this.

1548
01:03:03,061 --> 01:03:04,130
Let's just discuss it
some more, okay?

1549
01:03:04,221 --> 01:03:05,495
Yeah. Let's just
talk, dude.

1550
01:03:05,581 --> 01:03:08,254
We're giving you an
option. It's a choice, man.

1551
01:03:08,341 --> 01:03:10,173
There's nothing to
figure out, all right?

1552
01:03:10,262 --> 01:03:12,935
You guys have said enough, and
there's no going back anymore.

1553
01:03:14,102 --> 01:03:17,094
I don't know if there maybe is,
like, something you guys could give me

1554
01:03:17,182 --> 01:03:19,776
so I could at least have some sort
of protection while I'm out there.

1555
01:03:19,862 --> 01:03:22,172
Danny, you don't
have to do this.

1556
01:03:22,263 --> 01:03:23,662
- Yeah, man.
- All right,

1557
01:03:23,743 --> 01:03:24,937
if you're really leaving

1558
01:03:26,263 --> 01:03:28,332
then you should
take this.

1559
01:03:28,462 --> 01:03:30,100
Really?

1560
01:03:30,182 --> 01:03:32,491
You don't know
what's out there.

1561
01:03:35,823 --> 01:03:37,495
Thank you, James.

1562
01:03:38,383 --> 01:03:41,773
It means a lot to you, and I
appreciate that you'd give this to me,

1563
01:03:41,863 --> 01:03:43,694
you stupid,
stupid motherfucker!

1564
01:03:47,024 --> 01:03:49,777
Fucking psychopath.
It's a prop gun!

1565
01:03:49,864 --> 01:03:51,422
What, do you think I'd
put real bullets in here?

1566
01:03:51,504 --> 01:03:53,813
You were gonna send me out
there with a fucking gun

1567
01:03:53,904 --> 01:03:54,939
filled with blanks?
Oh, fuck you!

1568
01:03:55,024 --> 01:03:56,252
Don't turn this
around on us.

1569
01:03:56,344 --> 01:03:58,335
You just tried to shoot us,
you fucking dickhead!

1570
01:03:58,425 --> 01:03:59,460
Fucking murdering
motherfucker!

1571
01:03:59,545 --> 01:04:01,900
Whatever. Fucking
civilization is broken down.

1572
01:04:01,985 --> 01:04:04,374
There's no more reason
for this false bullshit.

1573
01:04:04,465 --> 01:04:06,376
You guys act like you're so
fucking high and mighty,

1574
01:04:06,465 --> 01:04:08,740
like you've never made a goddamn
mistake before.

1575
01:04:08,825 --> 01:04:10,780
Franco, you're just
a pretentious fucking nerd.

1576
01:04:10,864 --> 01:04:11,900
Fuck you.

1577
01:04:11,985 --> 01:04:13,054
And, Jonah,

1578
01:04:13,145 --> 01:04:14,498
you fucking cunt.

1579
01:04:16,225 --> 01:04:19,262
Craig, you didn't have
my back, back there.

1580
01:04:19,385 --> 01:04:21,501
You fuckin' disappoint me.
Bro.

1581
01:04:21,585 --> 01:04:24,339
And, Seth,
you duplicitous taint.

1582
01:04:24,426 --> 01:04:27,338
What? Then of course, there's Jay,

1583
01:04:27,426 --> 01:04:30,975
the self-righteous, cock-sucking,
two-faced backstabber.

1584
01:04:31,066 --> 01:04:32,784
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1585
01:04:32,906 --> 01:04:34,624
I overheard your little
conversation with Craig, all right?

1586
01:04:34,706 --> 01:04:37,016
The only reason why you
care about any of us is

1587
01:04:37,107 --> 01:04:38,745
because you think that's
what God wants you to do.

1588
01:04:38,827 --> 01:04:40,180
You don't give
a shit about us.

1589
01:04:40,267 --> 01:04:42,383
No, no, no, no, that's
fucking twisting that shit...

1590
01:04:42,467 --> 01:04:43,456
You're fucking lying.

1591
01:04:43,547 --> 01:04:44,900
Am I twisting this?

1592
01:04:44,987 --> 01:04:47,820
I believe you were
in Los Angeles

1593
01:04:47,907 --> 01:04:49,739
two months ago,
at the Four Seasons.

1594
01:04:49,828 --> 01:04:53,297
I saw you there, and you specifically
asked me not to tell Seth,

1595
01:04:53,427 --> 01:04:55,941
so that you could
maintain the illusion

1596
01:04:56,027 --> 01:04:57,460
that you always
stay with Seth

1597
01:04:57,547 --> 01:04:58,616
when you're in Los Angeles.

1598
01:04:58,707 --> 01:05:00,345
Ooh!

1599
01:05:01,388 --> 01:05:02,582
Jay.

1600
01:05:02,668 --> 01:05:04,386
Fuck, man.
It's not...

1601
01:05:04,468 --> 01:05:06,777
Textbook twattage.

1602
01:05:06,868 --> 01:05:08,859
And just for
the record, you guys,

1603
01:05:08,948 --> 01:05:11,223
I'm choosing to leave,
you're not kicking me out.

1604
01:05:11,308 --> 01:05:13,425
You guys had already said
that I could come back in

1605
01:05:13,509 --> 01:05:15,704
and I'm the one who said
that I'm not coming back in.

1606
01:05:15,789 --> 01:05:17,063
Don't be cocky.

1607
01:05:22,509 --> 01:05:23,862
Get the fuck
out of here.

1608
01:05:25,549 --> 01:05:27,188
Is that true?

1609
01:05:29,270 --> 01:05:30,305
Yes.

1610
01:05:30,390 --> 01:05:31,743
Jay...

1611
01:05:32,990 --> 01:05:34,469
I know this is
probably my fault

1612
01:05:34,550 --> 01:05:35,948
because I put you
on a pedestal,

1613
01:05:36,029 --> 01:05:38,703
but you should not be
dishonest with your friends.

1614
01:05:38,790 --> 01:05:40,860
But you really
let me down.

1615
01:05:41,950 --> 01:05:43,508
Hey! Whoa!
Jay, damn, man.

1616
01:05:43,590 --> 01:05:45,945
Fucker.
What the hell?

1617
01:05:46,030 --> 01:05:47,907
It's all fucked,
isn't it?

1618
01:05:48,630 --> 01:05:49,983
Jonah, you okay?
Yeah.

1619
01:05:50,470 --> 01:05:51,790
Bleeding?

1620
01:05:55,591 --> 01:05:56,580
Yeah.

1621
01:05:59,151 --> 01:06:03,144
His insides hurt worse
than my outsides.

1622
01:06:10,952 --> 01:06:12,271
Dear God,

1623
01:06:13,992 --> 01:06:16,268
I'd like to pray
to You for a second.

1624
01:06:16,353 --> 01:06:18,025
It's me, Jonah Hill.

1625
01:06:20,032 --> 01:06:21,704
From Moneyball.

1626
01:06:24,032 --> 01:06:28,424
I hate Jay
so fucking much.

1627
01:06:28,513 --> 01:06:31,471
I think he might be the
worst person You ever created.

1628
01:06:31,553 --> 01:06:35,068
I don't want to
judge You, but...

1629
01:06:35,153 --> 01:06:38,384
What's up? What were
You thinking that day?

1630
01:06:38,473 --> 01:06:43,025
I love Seth, I love being his
friend, he's an awesome guy,

1631
01:06:43,114 --> 01:06:45,389
but it's like Jay is
the last connection

1632
01:06:45,474 --> 01:06:48,989
to his shitty,
weird Canadian life.

1633
01:06:50,154 --> 01:06:51,906
Just do me one favor, God.

1634
01:06:54,115 --> 01:06:55,867
Just kill Jay.

1635
01:06:58,275 --> 01:06:59,867
That'd be so tight.

1636
01:07:58,118 --> 01:07:59,995
Stop, man.

1637
01:08:00,078 --> 01:08:02,228
Seriously, Craig, stop.

1638
01:08:02,718 --> 01:08:04,629
Your nails are sharp.

1639
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:17,908
This is no dream!

1640
01:08:18,879 --> 01:08:21,155
This is really happening!

1641
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:23,275
No!

1642
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,993
Something, um, not that
chill happened last night.

1643
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:45,272
Yo, so, I just drank my
own pee for the first time.

1644
01:08:45,961 --> 01:08:50,352
And it ain't bad.
I never thought to do it.

1645
01:08:50,441 --> 01:08:53,558
I always thought, you know,
pee stink, whatever, but...

1646
01:08:53,681 --> 01:08:55,034
Shh.

1647
01:09:11,562 --> 01:09:13,473
I think we all remember
how this works.

1648
01:09:13,562 --> 01:09:15,712
Whoever gets the burnt match
has to go to one of Franco's

1649
01:09:15,802 --> 01:09:17,713
neighbors' houses, get us
some food and some water.

1650
01:09:17,802 --> 01:09:19,633
No-ho-ho.
No, I'm not going first.

1651
01:09:19,722 --> 01:09:21,201
I'll go first.
Thank you.

1652
01:09:21,282 --> 01:09:23,034
Very mature of you.
Thank you.

1653
01:09:27,483 --> 01:09:28,836
Yes!

1654
01:09:28,923 --> 01:09:30,641
Sorry.

1655
01:09:31,763 --> 01:09:32,752
Good job.

1656
01:09:36,484 --> 01:09:37,678
You okay, Jonah?

1657
01:09:37,764 --> 01:09:38,799
What's that?

1658
01:09:38,884 --> 01:09:39,953
You okay?

1659
01:09:40,644 --> 01:09:43,477
Yeah. Just bad sleep.
Crazy dream.

1660
01:09:43,564 --> 01:09:44,838
Here, Jonah.

1661
01:09:48,085 --> 01:09:49,438
Jonah.

1662
01:09:49,525 --> 01:09:51,595
Okay.
Shit.

1663
01:09:51,685 --> 01:09:53,163
Craigers,
you feeling lucky?

1664
01:09:53,484 --> 01:09:54,963
Will history
repeat itself?

1665
01:09:57,724 --> 01:09:58,759
Thank you.

1666
01:10:01,805 --> 01:10:03,079
You got this, dawg.

1667
01:10:10,965 --> 01:10:13,321
Seth! No! Not you!

1668
01:10:20,486 --> 01:10:21,475
I'm not going.

1669
01:10:21,606 --> 01:10:23,961
What?
I'm not going.

1670
01:10:24,046 --> 01:10:25,320
I'm bowing out.
I'm declining to go.

1671
01:10:25,406 --> 01:10:26,442
What?

1672
01:10:26,527 --> 01:10:27,562
Let me break it
down for you.

1673
01:10:27,927 --> 01:10:29,519
I'm not fucking going.

1674
01:10:29,607 --> 01:10:31,643
You are definitely going.
Tell him he's fucking going.

1675
01:10:31,727 --> 01:10:34,002
Tell you what, why don't you
fucking go, Mr. Self-Righteous?

1676
01:10:34,087 --> 01:10:36,520
You're constantly saying what
assholes we are, how good you are.

1677
01:10:36,606 --> 01:10:38,165
You go get us
some fuckin' water.

1678
01:10:42,287 --> 01:10:43,402
I will go.

1679
01:10:44,567 --> 01:10:46,205
Because I have

1680
01:10:46,287 --> 01:10:48,164
something called honor.
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

1681
01:10:48,247 --> 01:10:50,044
That's good. Yeah,
you're very honorable.

1682
01:10:50,488 --> 01:10:51,841
I'll go with you, Jay.

1683
01:10:51,928 --> 01:10:53,077
Really?

1684
01:10:53,168 --> 01:10:55,557
Is it because of
our pact upstairs?

1685
01:10:55,648 --> 01:10:58,082
Nah, 'cause you got
them skinny-ass arms.

1686
01:10:58,168 --> 01:11:00,204
You couldn't carry enough
to feed a hamster.

1687
01:11:01,688 --> 01:11:02,723
It's working.

1688
01:11:06,249 --> 01:11:07,602
Let's get that money.

1689
01:11:07,689 --> 01:11:09,247
Let's do it.

1690
01:11:09,769 --> 01:11:12,078
Yo. Out and to the left. Shh-shh.

1691
01:11:19,569 --> 01:11:20,604
Bye.

1692
01:11:25,609 --> 01:11:26,928
Oh, my God.

1693
01:11:27,049 --> 01:11:28,278
What?

1694
01:11:28,810 --> 01:11:30,448
That's so sad.

1695
01:11:31,650 --> 01:11:33,766
Innocence lost.

1696
01:11:39,810 --> 01:11:41,164
What is that?

1697
01:11:41,451 --> 01:11:42,406
Fire.

1698
01:11:42,491 --> 01:11:43,970
There's, like,
fire everywhere.

1699
01:11:44,051 --> 01:11:45,325
Damn it!

1700
01:11:46,291 --> 01:11:47,644
Hey, hey!

1701
01:11:49,531 --> 01:11:51,726
Fuck, yeah. Let's go,
let's go, let's go.

1702
01:12:06,892 --> 01:12:08,610
Hello?
Shut the fuck up!

1703
01:12:08,732 --> 01:12:10,370
What? You yelling that shit for?

1704
01:12:10,452 --> 01:12:12,170
We got to find out...
Don't yell no more, man.

1705
01:12:12,252 --> 01:12:14,243
Crack you in the head
with this frying pan.

1706
01:12:14,332 --> 01:12:18,326
Okay. So we should probably
split up, cover more ground.

1707
01:12:18,413 --> 01:12:20,688
What you think
this is, Scooby-Doo?

1708
01:12:20,813 --> 01:12:22,451
We're gonna go in there,
we're gonna find the kitchen,

1709
01:12:22,533 --> 01:12:24,251
and get as much shit
as we can, together!

1710
01:12:24,333 --> 01:12:25,482
Then we're getting
the fuck out of here.

1711
01:12:25,613 --> 01:12:27,331
All right, all right.
All right?

1712
01:12:31,054 --> 01:12:32,043
Hey.

1713
01:12:32,654 --> 01:12:33,769
Hey.

1714
01:12:33,854 --> 01:12:35,446
What are you doing?

1715
01:12:35,534 --> 01:12:37,729
That should be me
out there.

1716
01:12:37,814 --> 01:12:39,532
I totally fucked
those guys.

1717
01:12:40,174 --> 01:12:41,527
Mmm.

1718
01:12:42,855 --> 01:12:44,003
Fuck was that?

1719
01:12:45,614 --> 01:12:47,525
Oh, fuck!
Is he okay?

1720
01:12:47,614 --> 01:12:48,763
Dude! Jonah!

1721
01:12:48,854 --> 01:12:50,287
What the fuck?
What do we do?

1722
01:12:50,374 --> 01:12:52,012
- Do you know first aid or anything?
- No.

1723
01:12:52,094 --> 01:12:53,163
Jonah!
I suck at first aid.

1724
01:12:53,254 --> 01:12:54,528
Are you okay? Shit!
Jonah?

1725
01:12:54,614 --> 01:12:56,446
Oh, no.
Low blood sugar. LBS.

1726
01:12:56,535 --> 01:12:58,366
LBS! He's having an
LBS episode!

1727
01:12:58,455 --> 01:13:00,491
I'll get the Milky Way!
You get the Milky Way!

1728
01:13:03,735 --> 01:13:04,770
Ugh!

1729
01:13:09,416 --> 01:13:10,895
Jay.

1730
01:13:13,576 --> 01:13:15,646
Jonah, stay with me!
Stay with me.

1731
01:13:15,736 --> 01:13:17,647
I got it, I got it, I got
it, got it, open his mouth.

1732
01:13:17,736 --> 01:13:19,010
It's your friend, Seth.
Open his mouth.

1733
01:13:19,096 --> 01:13:21,565
Open his mouth. Open his
mouth. I'll get this in there.

1734
01:13:21,657 --> 01:13:22,976
Okay, okay.
Shove it right in there.

1735
01:13:23,057 --> 01:13:24,570
Jonah.
Milky Way, Jonah.

1736
01:13:24,657 --> 01:13:26,170
You love the Milky Way.
Yummy, yum.

1737
01:13:26,257 --> 01:13:27,575
It's not fucking
working, man!

1738
01:13:27,656 --> 01:13:28,645
What the fuck!

1739
01:13:28,736 --> 01:13:29,851
How do we
get it in there?

1740
01:13:29,936 --> 01:13:33,088
Chew it up, chew it up and spit
in his mouth like a baby bird.

1741
01:13:33,817 --> 01:13:34,806
Mmm!

1742
01:13:34,937 --> 01:13:35,926
You just
swallowed it, man.

1743
01:13:36,017 --> 01:13:37,006
It's so good.

1744
01:13:37,097 --> 01:13:38,689
Give me a bite.

1745
01:13:38,777 --> 01:13:39,846
Mmm!

1746
01:13:39,937 --> 01:13:42,610
The second it hits your
mouth is, like, amazing.

1747
01:13:44,097 --> 01:13:46,248
Okay.
Open it.

1748
01:13:53,658 --> 01:13:55,250
What the fuck was that?

1749
01:13:55,338 --> 01:13:57,374
That's Hebrew.
That's not Hebrew.

1750
01:13:57,458 --> 01:13:58,812
It's fuckin' Latin
or something like that.

1751
01:13:58,899 --> 01:14:00,537
I went to Hebrew school for
six years. That's not Hebrew.

1752
01:14:01,979 --> 01:14:04,209
You will drown in
a river of blood.

1753
01:14:04,299 --> 01:14:06,210
The End of Days is here.

1754
01:14:06,299 --> 01:14:09,211
You will quiver in the
shadow of Kingdom Come.

1755
01:14:09,299 --> 01:14:12,211
Judgment Day is upon you.

1756
01:14:12,299 --> 01:14:16,577
The Apocalypse is nigh!

1757
01:14:19,139 --> 01:14:21,095
Hey, I think
that's all it could fit.

1758
01:14:21,819 --> 01:14:25,859
Man, let's take this back to
Franco's, get the fuck out of here.

1759
01:14:25,940 --> 01:14:27,134
Uh, uh...

1760
01:14:27,860 --> 01:14:29,054
What are we
going back for?

1761
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:30,209
What are you
talking about?

1762
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:34,259
In theory, we could
just fuckin' stay here.

1763
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:37,253
And here,
you don't have to sleep

1764
01:14:37,341 --> 01:14:40,219
in a friggin'
tent under a dick.

1765
01:14:40,301 --> 01:14:41,654
I like my dick tent.

1766
01:14:41,741 --> 01:14:42,776
I'm just saying,

1767
01:14:42,861 --> 01:14:46,649
we could build a life here together,
Craig. I'd be really good to you.

1768
01:14:47,101 --> 01:14:49,013
All I know is
I'm scared as hell,

1769
01:14:49,142 --> 01:14:51,895
and I just want to
get back to our friends.

1770
01:14:51,982 --> 01:14:53,175
Yeah, but they're
not my friends.

1771
01:14:53,661 --> 01:14:54,616
Seth is your friend.

1772
01:14:54,701 --> 01:14:56,896
We've been growing apart for years.

1773
01:14:57,021 --> 01:14:59,581
That's why I didn't stay
with him last time I was here.

1774
01:14:59,661 --> 01:15:02,096
And I stayed with him this
time to try and salvage it,

1775
01:15:02,182 --> 01:15:03,934
but clearly
that didn't work out.

1776
01:15:04,022 --> 01:15:06,661
Jay, like it or not,

1777
01:15:07,302 --> 01:15:09,020
those assholes
are all we got.

1778
01:15:13,063 --> 01:15:14,052
Did you hear that?

1779
01:15:14,143 --> 01:15:15,656
Yeah, that was a creak.

1780
01:15:20,783 --> 01:15:22,774
What is that?

1781
01:15:24,143 --> 01:15:26,180
Ew! What is that? Is that bile?

1782
01:15:26,304 --> 01:15:28,340
I don't know.
It's cold.

1783
01:15:28,424 --> 01:15:29,652
Sniff it.

1784
01:15:29,744 --> 01:15:32,212
No. You sniff it.

1785
01:15:33,264 --> 01:15:34,299
Ew!

1786
01:15:34,384 --> 01:15:36,055
What?
It smells like puke.

1787
01:15:36,143 --> 01:15:37,132
Ew! Ew!

1788
01:15:37,223 --> 01:15:38,862
Don't get it on me! Ew!

1789
01:15:49,544 --> 01:15:50,864
It's in my eyes!
Dude!

1790
01:15:50,945 --> 01:15:53,254
It's in my mouth!
He's gone!

1791
01:15:53,345 --> 01:15:55,495
Where is he?
He's fucking gone!

1792
01:15:55,625 --> 01:15:57,820
Shit! Shit!
Shit! Shit!

1793
01:16:07,306 --> 01:16:09,900
Please, God!
Jesus, Jesus!

1794
01:16:17,547 --> 01:16:18,535
Fuck.

1795
01:16:19,306 --> 01:16:21,024
Jonah!
Jonah!

1796
01:16:21,106 --> 01:16:23,176
Jonah, stop this!

1797
01:16:23,306 --> 01:16:24,864
Please! Jonah, where the fuck are you?

1798
01:16:24,946 --> 01:16:26,584
Why did you vomit on us!

1799
01:16:30,027 --> 01:16:31,938
Bad Jonah! Stop!

1800
01:16:32,027 --> 01:16:33,858
Stop eating him!

1801
01:16:33,947 --> 01:16:35,938
Watch out!
He's super strong!

1802
01:16:36,067 --> 01:16:37,056
Aah!

1803
01:16:38,467 --> 01:16:39,536
Shit!

1804
01:16:39,627 --> 01:16:41,778
What is happen...

1805
01:16:41,868 --> 01:16:43,017
Oh, no!

1806
01:16:43,108 --> 01:16:44,860
I'm gonna
tittie-fuck you, Seth.

1807
01:16:44,948 --> 01:16:46,381
Don't tittie-fuck me!

1808
01:16:46,468 --> 01:16:47,901
What are they,
big B's or small C's?

1809
01:16:47,988 --> 01:16:50,548
I'm gonna push
your titties together.

1810
01:16:50,628 --> 01:16:52,266
Push 'em together!

1811
01:16:52,348 --> 01:16:53,907
I'll get you something to help!

1812
01:16:53,989 --> 01:16:54,978
I'll pass
you something!

1813
01:16:55,069 --> 01:16:56,138
Okay, pass it to me.

1814
01:16:56,789 --> 01:16:58,745
Ow! Fuck! Shit!

1815
01:17:01,788 --> 01:17:02,777
Aah! Oh!

1816
01:17:04,788 --> 01:17:05,904
Seth!

1817
01:17:07,469 --> 01:17:09,460
We're getting crazy!

1818
01:17:15,389 --> 01:17:16,663
Come on! Come on!

1819
01:17:18,070 --> 01:17:20,584
Jesus, open,
God damn you, open!

1820
01:17:23,910 --> 01:17:25,741
No, no, no, no.

1821
01:17:31,551 --> 01:17:32,984
Jesus...

1822
01:17:33,511 --> 01:17:35,866
Oh, fuck.

1823
01:17:36,351 --> 01:17:38,023
We gotta hide. We gotta hide. I know!

1824
01:17:38,191 --> 01:17:39,510
He's coming! He's coming!
I know he's coming!

1825
01:17:39,551 --> 01:17:41,109
I don't know
what the fuck to do!

1826
01:17:41,191 --> 01:17:42,910
I don't know...

1827
01:17:43,232 --> 01:17:44,664
Where are you going?

1828
01:17:45,071 --> 01:17:46,663
Shit.

1829
01:17:55,232 --> 01:17:57,188
Please go away.
He's sniffing.

1830
01:17:57,952 --> 01:17:58,941
I'm so scared, James.

1831
01:17:59,032 --> 01:18:00,147
Be quiet.

1832
01:18:01,712 --> 01:18:03,430
You're breathing really loud. Am I?

1833
01:18:03,832 --> 01:18:04,981
Don't breathe through your mouth. Okay.

1834
01:18:07,352 --> 01:18:10,186
Now you're doing loud
nose breathing. Am I?

1835
01:18:10,273 --> 01:18:12,070
I don't know where else
to breathe from.

1836
01:18:13,713 --> 01:18:14,828
Is that...
Seth.

1837
01:18:19,873 --> 01:18:21,466
Oh, shit.
Don't move.

1838
01:18:21,554 --> 01:18:23,192
Oh, shit, he's coming
right this way. Oh, shit.

1839
01:18:23,274 --> 01:18:24,548
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1840
01:18:32,153 --> 01:18:34,065
Get out of my way!
Move! Move!

1841
01:18:34,154 --> 01:18:36,110
Fuck!

1842
01:18:39,234 --> 01:18:40,223
You okay?

1843
01:18:40,314 --> 01:18:41,463
Come on!

1844
01:18:41,594 --> 01:18:45,588
Let's go. Let's go.
Okay. Okay. Okay.

1845
01:18:48,115 --> 01:18:49,912
What the fuck!
What are you doing?

1846
01:18:49,995 --> 01:18:51,428
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

1847
01:18:51,515 --> 01:18:52,994
There's a fuckin'
demon chasing us!

1848
01:18:53,075 --> 01:18:54,667
A demon?
Demon?

1849
01:18:54,755 --> 01:18:57,589
What the fuck happened
to you guys? That!

1850
01:18:57,676 --> 01:18:59,075
It's Jonah!
He's possessed!

1851
01:18:59,196 --> 01:19:00,424
He's crazy!

1852
01:19:01,396 --> 01:19:03,751
Oh, fuck!
You brained him.

1853
01:19:03,836 --> 01:19:05,554
Is that... I was supposed
to do that, right?

1854
01:19:05,636 --> 01:19:06,705
Yeah.

1855
01:19:10,116 --> 01:19:11,947
Motherfucker.

1856
01:19:12,636 --> 01:19:14,194
- Fasten!
- Hurry!

1857
01:19:14,276 --> 01:19:15,629
Fasten,
God damn you, bastard!

1858
01:19:15,716 --> 01:19:16,751
He's gonna be fuckin'

1859
01:19:16,836 --> 01:19:18,189
bad news
when he wakes up!

1860
01:19:18,276 --> 01:19:20,107
He's fuckin' strong.

1861
01:19:20,196 --> 01:19:21,868
My side's good.
Oh, shit!

1862
01:19:21,956 --> 01:19:23,515
All right,
I'll fuckin' hit him.

1863
01:19:23,637 --> 01:19:25,195
Fuck! Come on, come on!
Okay!

1864
01:19:30,637 --> 01:19:33,071
This shit's
cray cray, guys.

1865
01:19:33,397 --> 01:19:36,356
I mean, it's, like,
the real, like Apocalypse.

1866
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:38,747
It's, like,
the Book of Revelations,

1867
01:19:38,838 --> 01:19:40,988
like that means
there's a God.

1868
01:19:41,078 --> 01:19:42,397
Right?

1869
01:19:42,478 --> 01:19:45,151
I haven't led my life as though
there's a God this whole time.

1870
01:19:45,238 --> 01:19:47,707
Who fuckin' saw that coming?
That there's actually a God?

1871
01:19:47,799 --> 01:19:51,109
I'd say 95%
of the planet.

1872
01:19:52,638 --> 01:19:54,754
Jesus fucking Christ, man.

1873
01:19:54,878 --> 01:19:56,914
You might want to stay
away from saying that.

1874
01:19:56,998 --> 01:19:59,432
"Jesus fucking Christ"?
Why?

1875
01:19:59,558 --> 01:20:01,231
Why can't I say that?
One of the Ten Commandments.

1876
01:20:01,319 --> 01:20:04,152
"Thou shall not take the name
of the Lord thy God in vain. "

1877
01:20:04,239 --> 01:20:05,672
Jesus isn't the name
of the Lord.

1878
01:20:05,759 --> 01:20:06,953
God is name
of the Lord.

1879
01:20:07,039 --> 01:20:09,075
Jesus, God,
it's all the same.

1880
01:20:09,159 --> 01:20:11,468
It's the Trinity.
Father, Son, Holy Ghost.

1881
01:20:11,559 --> 01:20:13,437
It's like Neapolitan
ice cream.

1882
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:15,112
I don't even know what
the fucking Commandments are.

1883
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:19,352
Guys, I think this is sort of
bullshit, because we're all good people.

1884
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:22,592
I can look at each one of you
in the eye, I know you're good.

1885
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:24,318
I'm good.
We're four actors.

1886
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:26,357
We bring joy
to people's lives.

1887
01:20:26,441 --> 01:20:28,159
Yeah, but we don't
do it for free.

1888
01:20:28,241 --> 01:20:32,439
We get paid handsomely, much
higher than the average profession.

1889
01:20:32,521 --> 01:20:34,273
It's not like it was just
handed to any of us.

1890
01:20:34,361 --> 01:20:35,998
We've worked really
hard to be here.

1891
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:38,197
Yeah, pretend like
it's hot when it's cold.

1892
01:20:38,721 --> 01:20:40,871
You sitting on the beach,
it's freezing,

1893
01:20:40,961 --> 01:20:45,034
you in your drawers, talking about
something, everybody's surfing.

1894
01:20:45,121 --> 01:20:47,316
I think God
might have just fucked up,

1895
01:20:47,401 --> 01:20:50,439
made a mistake, and left
us behind by accident.

1896
01:20:50,562 --> 01:20:52,518
I mean, He's got a lot
of shit on His plate.

1897
01:20:52,602 --> 01:20:55,674
It's not an oversight,
it's not a mistake, okay?

1898
01:20:55,762 --> 01:20:59,914
We got to face facts. We're here,
and there's a reason we're all here.

1899
01:21:00,002 --> 01:21:02,312
Why are you so sure?

1900
01:21:02,403 --> 01:21:04,473
I've done things, man. I...

1901
01:21:07,603 --> 01:21:09,355
I gouged a man's
eyeballs out.

1902
01:21:09,443 --> 01:21:11,195
What the...
Fuck off.

1903
01:21:11,283 --> 01:21:13,035
Craig.
Well, I was a kid, man.

1904
01:21:13,123 --> 01:21:15,319
It was a fuckin' bar fight.

1905
01:21:15,404 --> 01:21:16,723
It was a bad
foosball game.

1906
01:21:16,804 --> 01:21:19,476
He said I didn't call spinneys,
and I fuckin' called spinneys.

1907
01:21:19,563 --> 01:21:22,396
He got all in my face, and I
smashed a bottle across his face...

1908
01:21:23,323 --> 01:21:24,995
...and the first eyeball
was an accident,

1909
01:21:25,083 --> 01:21:27,723
but then I was, like, fuck it,
and I went for the second one.

1910
01:21:27,804 --> 01:21:29,840
It was fucked up.
But you know what?

1911
01:21:29,924 --> 01:21:34,361
That shit happens. I'm saying,
that's... I think that's why I'm here.

1912
01:21:34,484 --> 01:21:36,520
I got to admit something.

1913
01:21:36,604 --> 01:21:37,878
I, uh...

1914
01:21:39,765 --> 01:21:41,164
I fucked Lindsay Lohan.

1915
01:21:41,285 --> 01:21:44,118
She was fucked up.
She was high.

1916
01:21:44,245 --> 01:21:45,473
It was at
the Chateau Marmont,

1917
01:21:45,565 --> 01:21:46,793
and she kept banging
on my door.

1918
01:21:48,365 --> 01:21:50,083
She kept calling
me Jake Gyllenhaal.

1919
01:21:50,165 --> 01:21:51,439
That's fucked up.

1920
01:21:51,525 --> 01:21:55,041
Yeah, I said, "Call me
the Prince of Persia. "

1921
01:21:55,126 --> 01:21:56,320
See, that's what
I'm saying, man.

1922
01:21:56,406 --> 01:21:58,362
We've all done bad shit,
you know?

1923
01:21:58,446 --> 01:22:02,040
We've done more bad shit
than good in our lives, and

1924
01:22:03,445 --> 01:22:06,279
it's time to
pay the piper.

1925
01:22:07,246 --> 01:22:08,395
Whoa, shit!

1926
01:22:08,486 --> 01:22:10,477
Something's wrong.

1927
01:22:11,446 --> 01:22:12,765
God did this.

1928
01:22:12,806 --> 01:22:16,435
He gave us light,
and then He took it away.

1929
01:22:16,526 --> 01:22:17,880
You hear that?

1930
01:22:17,967 --> 01:22:20,037
It's the soundtrack
of us going insane.

1931
01:22:20,127 --> 01:22:22,960
Damn, I wish there was something
we could do to help him.

1932
01:22:24,007 --> 01:22:25,645
I know what we can do.

1933
01:22:34,488 --> 01:22:36,365
The fuckin' stench.

1934
01:22:50,168 --> 01:22:51,157
Jonah Hill?

1935
01:22:52,888 --> 01:22:54,207
Jonah?

1936
01:22:57,409 --> 01:22:58,808
Jonah Hill.

1937
01:22:58,889 --> 01:23:01,005
Jonah Hill is no more.

1938
01:23:02,249 --> 01:23:03,364
Demon?

1939
01:23:03,449 --> 01:23:05,280
Yes?

1940
01:23:05,369 --> 01:23:07,281
Fuck. That's not good.

1941
01:23:07,370 --> 01:23:08,644
That's not good.

1942
01:23:09,370 --> 01:23:10,928
Jay, you fool.

1943
01:23:11,010 --> 01:23:13,478
I say unto thee,

1944
01:23:14,010 --> 01:23:16,444
the power of Christ
compels you!

1945
01:23:16,530 --> 01:23:19,363
Oh, does it?
Does it compel me?

1946
01:23:19,450 --> 01:23:21,487
The power of Christ
compels you!

1947
01:23:21,571 --> 01:23:22,560
Does it, Jay?

1948
01:23:22,651 --> 01:23:24,562
The power of Christ
compels you!

1949
01:23:24,651 --> 01:23:26,641
Is the power of Christ compelling
me? Is that what's happening?

1950
01:23:26,810 --> 01:23:29,278
The power of Christ
compels you!

1951
01:23:29,370 --> 01:23:31,804
Guess what?
It's not that compelling.

1952
01:23:31,890 --> 01:23:34,041
Jay, you serious
right now?

1953
01:23:34,131 --> 01:23:36,406
That's your fuckin' plan? You're
gonna repeat lines from The Exorcist?

1954
01:23:36,531 --> 01:23:38,681
I would assume they did
their fuckin' research.

1955
01:23:38,771 --> 01:23:40,602
It's a movie!
It's a manual.

1956
01:23:40,731 --> 01:23:42,608
It's a fuckin'
training manual.

1957
01:23:44,531 --> 01:23:45,965
I say unto thee,

1958
01:23:46,252 --> 01:23:48,720
the power of Christ
compels you!

1959
01:23:48,812 --> 01:23:51,007
The power of Christ
compels you!

1960
01:23:51,852 --> 01:23:54,002
The power of Christ
compels you!

1961
01:23:54,132 --> 01:23:55,645
Geez, it hurts
a little bit.

1962
01:23:55,732 --> 01:23:56,960
It's, like,
this little sting.

1963
01:23:57,092 --> 01:23:59,482
The power of Christ
compels you!

1964
01:23:59,573 --> 01:24:00,642
Seriously, fuck off.

1965
01:24:00,733 --> 01:24:03,247
The power of Christ
compels you!

1966
01:24:05,533 --> 01:24:06,932
Jay?

1967
01:24:07,133 --> 01:24:08,804
The power of Christ
compels you!

1968
01:24:08,892 --> 01:24:09,928
Holy shit!

1969
01:24:09,973 --> 01:24:11,531
You're pissing him
off, man. Just stop it!

1970
01:24:11,613 --> 01:24:13,410
Jay! The power of Christ compels you!

1971
01:24:15,933 --> 01:24:17,730
The power of...
Get the fuck down!

1972
01:24:17,853 --> 01:24:19,889
Don't fucking push
me, asshole! Geez, man!

1973
01:24:19,973 --> 01:24:20,962
Easy!
Fuck you!

1974
01:24:21,053 --> 01:24:22,123
You're a fucking
asshole, you liar!

1975
01:24:22,214 --> 01:24:23,203
Still?

1976
01:24:23,294 --> 01:24:24,283
Yes. Still? Yes.

1977
01:24:24,414 --> 01:24:25,847
Guys, guys, we got
a possessed guy here!

1978
01:24:25,934 --> 01:24:27,526
Do we have to argue
about this right now?

1979
01:24:27,614 --> 01:24:28,569
Let 'em fight.

1980
01:24:28,654 --> 01:24:30,167
We got an exorcism
to finish. Hello?

1981
01:24:30,294 --> 01:24:31,522
Do you want to know why
I didn't stay with you?

1982
01:24:31,614 --> 01:24:33,172
Yeah.
You fuckin' changed.

1983
01:24:33,254 --> 01:24:36,133
You're a fuckin'
sell-out.

1984
01:24:36,215 --> 01:24:38,445
You did fuckin' sell out.
Everyone says.

1985
01:24:38,535 --> 01:24:42,369
At least I did change! You act like
you're fucking 18 years old still, Jay!

1986
01:24:42,455 --> 01:24:44,764
Grow up, Jay. That's
why he's yelling at you.

1987
01:24:44,895 --> 01:24:46,931
You've been holding me
back this whole time!

1988
01:24:47,015 --> 01:24:48,574
That means fuck you.

1989
01:24:48,656 --> 01:24:50,692
Come on, guys!
Come on!

1990
01:24:52,055 --> 01:24:54,046
Fuck you,
you piece of shit!

1991
01:24:57,415 --> 01:24:58,609
Everybody, out!

1992
01:24:58,695 --> 01:24:59,924
Craig, stop 'em!

1993
01:25:00,016 --> 01:25:01,813
Get apart!
Oh, now it's on.

1994
01:25:01,896 --> 01:25:04,285
Yo! What the fuck
is all this, Franco?

1995
01:25:05,616 --> 01:25:07,208
Uh, looks like food.
How'd that get there?

1996
01:25:07,296 --> 01:25:09,685
What?
You have more food?

1997
01:25:09,776 --> 01:25:10,970
You knew he had
extra food?

1998
01:25:11,056 --> 01:25:12,775
Yeah, he gave me
one cracker.

1999
01:25:12,857 --> 01:25:14,415
I would have sucked a
dick for half a cracker.

2000
01:25:14,497 --> 01:25:16,727
All right, well, maybe I didn't
want you to suck my dick, all right?

2001
01:25:16,857 --> 01:25:17,972
Look... I didn't want to suck it!

2002
01:25:18,137 --> 01:25:19,729
That's the point of what I
said! It was my fucking food!

2003
01:25:19,817 --> 01:25:20,806
Guys, guys,
guys, fire!

2004
01:25:20,897 --> 01:25:21,932
Boys, boys, boys...

2005
01:25:22,057 --> 01:25:24,048
Shit!
Jonah's on fire!

2006
01:25:29,858 --> 01:25:31,177
Put it out!

2007
01:25:31,258 --> 01:25:32,657
Use your mouth!
Put it out!

2008
01:25:41,578 --> 01:25:43,011
Go, go, go, go, go!

2009
01:25:52,019 --> 01:25:53,498
Where is he? Where is he?
Where is he?

2010
01:25:53,579 --> 01:25:54,728
Go, go, go!

2011
01:25:57,339 --> 01:25:58,931
Go, go, go, go, go!

2012
01:25:59,019 --> 01:26:00,771
Go, get outside!

2013
01:26:00,859 --> 01:26:02,771
Shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit!

2014
01:26:02,860 --> 01:26:03,849
Go, go on!

2015
01:26:03,940 --> 01:26:06,010
Come on, hurry up,
he's coming!

2016
01:26:06,100 --> 01:26:07,772
He's coming!

2017
01:26:20,940 --> 01:26:22,578
Watch out, watch out!

2018
01:26:22,940 --> 01:26:25,249
Oh, my fortress!

2019
01:26:26,180 --> 01:26:29,014
Uh, boys, I just want
to point out, um,

2020
01:26:29,101 --> 01:26:30,580
we're out
in the open now.

2021
01:26:31,301 --> 01:26:32,416
Oh, fuck.
Shit, shit, shit.

2022
01:26:32,501 --> 01:26:34,651
Oh, shit.
Hey, hey, hey.

2023
01:26:34,741 --> 01:26:35,856
My Prius.
Yeah!

2024
01:26:35,941 --> 01:26:37,738
Yeah!
Yes!

2025
01:26:40,902 --> 01:26:41,971
What is that?

2026
01:26:42,742 --> 01:26:44,733
No fucking way.

2027
01:26:44,862 --> 01:26:46,818
We're screwed!

2028
01:26:46,902 --> 01:26:49,370
We're totally
screwed, guys.

2029
01:26:52,223 --> 01:26:53,212
I got this.

2030
01:26:53,303 --> 01:26:54,861
What?
I'll distract the thing.

2031
01:26:54,943 --> 01:26:56,899
I'll run over there
screaming and shit,

2032
01:26:56,983 --> 01:27:00,577
and that should give you enough
time to get to the garage.

2033
01:27:00,702 --> 01:27:02,294
Well, yeah, but that thing can kill you.

2034
01:27:02,382 --> 01:27:05,773
Maybe I deserve it. I've
been shitty my whole life.

2035
01:27:05,863 --> 01:27:08,093
Being selfish,
only doing shit for me.

2036
01:27:08,183 --> 01:27:10,492
Maybe it's only right
that the last thing I do

2037
01:27:10,583 --> 01:27:13,655
on this planet
isn't for me.

2038
01:27:13,903 --> 01:27:15,131
It's for you guys.

2039
01:27:15,223 --> 01:27:16,942
Craig, you don't have to do that.

2040
01:27:17,024 --> 01:27:18,343
Thank you
very much, Craig.

2041
01:27:18,424 --> 01:27:20,176
I appreciate that.
You spineless...

2042
01:27:20,904 --> 01:27:22,815
I love you guys.

2043
01:27:23,024 --> 01:27:24,662
You're my best friends.

2044
01:27:24,744 --> 01:27:26,735
You're a real
mensch, Craig.

2045
01:27:26,824 --> 01:27:29,019
See you on
the other side.

2046
01:27:33,505 --> 01:27:36,622
Hey, hey, asshole!
Hey, come on!

2047
01:27:36,705 --> 01:27:38,775
Pickle dick,
demonic-looking motherfucker.

2048
01:27:38,865 --> 01:27:40,981
Nobody's scared of you.
You ain't a raccoon!

2049
01:27:41,065 --> 01:27:42,862
Yeah, bring
your ass, bitch!

2050
01:27:42,945 --> 01:27:45,823
Nobody's scared of you!
I'm Craig fucking Robinson!

2051
01:27:46,025 --> 01:27:47,140
Yeah.

2052
01:27:47,225 --> 01:27:48,374
What's he gonna do?
Craig.

2053
01:27:48,505 --> 01:27:51,542
I hope you like big dick,
motherfucker,

2054
01:27:51,625 --> 01:27:53,456
'cause I'm about
to fuck you raw!

2055
01:27:53,545 --> 01:27:55,821
For the last goddamn time!

2056
01:27:56,346 --> 01:27:57,938
Take your panties off!

2057
01:28:08,787 --> 01:28:10,425
Fuck, yeah!

2058
01:28:12,787 --> 01:28:13,742
It worked.

2059
01:28:13,827 --> 01:28:15,340
What's happening?

2060
01:28:15,427 --> 01:28:17,418
Craig! Craig!

2061
01:28:30,387 --> 01:28:33,505
Holy shit, do you guys
realize what this means?

2062
01:28:33,588 --> 01:28:35,067
That Craig was an angel this whole time?

2063
01:28:35,188 --> 01:28:38,066
No, no, it means we can
still be saved. No, no.

2064
01:28:40,028 --> 01:28:42,906
I don't fucking get it, why
does Craig get saved? I mean...

2065
01:28:42,988 --> 01:28:45,344
Craig sacrificed
himself for us,

2066
01:28:45,429 --> 01:28:47,226
which means that
there's still hope.

2067
01:28:47,349 --> 01:28:49,146
That means we can be redeemed.
Yeah.

2068
01:28:49,229 --> 01:28:50,947
It means that if we're
actually nice to each other,

2069
01:28:51,069 --> 01:28:53,822
we can get sucked up into
Heaven, too. That's the deal.

2070
01:28:53,949 --> 01:28:55,621
All right, I got it,
let's just head out

2071
01:28:55,709 --> 01:28:57,985
to my place in Malibu.
Yeah.

2072
01:28:58,070 --> 01:29:01,221
Just survive long enough
until we do enough good things

2073
01:29:01,310 --> 01:29:03,346
and they accumulate
or do enough sacrifices,

2074
01:29:03,430 --> 01:29:04,545
and we'll all go
to Heaven together.

2075
01:29:04,630 --> 01:29:06,586
That's a great
idea, James.

2076
01:29:06,710 --> 01:29:08,348
Seriously, really, really good idea.

2077
01:29:08,429 --> 01:29:10,261
Really, you're
such a smart guy.

2078
01:29:10,350 --> 01:29:12,386
Thanks, Seth,
you're such a nice guy.

2079
01:29:12,710 --> 01:29:13,699
You got a great smile.

2080
01:29:13,790 --> 01:29:15,462
Thanks, man.
And an awesome laugh.

2081
01:29:15,590 --> 01:29:17,546
I've heard it's annoying. How
about that Jay back there, man?

2082
01:29:17,670 --> 01:29:19,228
Dude, Jay, you kidding me? Come on.
Oh, come on.

2083
01:29:19,350 --> 01:29:20,624
One of a kind.
Get out of here.

2084
01:29:20,710 --> 01:29:21,905
You got a cool body.

2085
01:29:21,991 --> 01:29:23,470
You can walk around with
your shirt off anytime.

2086
01:29:23,551 --> 01:29:25,189
It's not working,
this isn't working.

2087
01:29:25,271 --> 01:29:27,068
What, you thought we
would be Raptured already?

2088
01:29:27,191 --> 01:29:28,226
I thought it would
happen already.

2089
01:29:28,311 --> 01:29:29,426
No, we've just
been talking nice.

2090
01:29:29,511 --> 01:29:31,388
Talking nice doesn't
get you into Heaven.

2091
01:29:31,471 --> 01:29:33,587
Doesn't hurt to smile...

2092
01:29:36,232 --> 01:29:37,221
What the fuck?

2093
01:29:37,312 --> 01:29:38,631
You guys okay?

2094
01:29:38,712 --> 01:29:40,430
Oh, shit.
Christ.

2095
01:29:50,673 --> 01:29:52,105
- Franco!
- Come on!

2096
01:29:55,032 --> 01:29:56,670
Yo, cut his fucking
head off!

2097
01:29:56,752 --> 01:29:57,867
What's going on?

2098
01:29:59,233 --> 01:30:01,189
No!

2099
01:30:01,273 --> 01:30:02,501
Stop!
No!

2100
01:30:20,034 --> 01:30:21,183
Danny?

2101
01:30:21,274 --> 01:30:22,468
What the fuck?

2102
01:30:22,554 --> 01:30:23,669
You guys are
still alive?

2103
01:30:23,794 --> 01:30:24,864
Yeah.

2104
01:30:24,955 --> 01:30:27,025
Holy shit,
I didn't expect that.

2105
01:30:27,115 --> 01:30:29,026
Fuck out here.

2106
01:30:29,955 --> 01:30:30,990
Get...

2107
01:30:31,115 --> 01:30:32,867
Shit, I can't believe you guys are here.
Oh, Jesus.

2108
01:30:32,955 --> 01:30:36,709
That's fucking crazy, and your timing
couldn't be more perfect.

2109
01:30:37,075 --> 01:30:39,669
It's been a long time
since any of us have eaten,

2110
01:30:39,755 --> 01:30:42,553
and you three gentlemen
look delicious.

2111
01:30:42,635 --> 01:30:43,750
What does that
have to do with us?

2112
01:30:43,835 --> 01:30:45,666
The fuck are
you talking about?

2113
01:30:45,755 --> 01:30:47,427
I'm a cannibal, hombre.

2114
01:30:47,515 --> 01:30:49,313
We're gonna
fucking eat your ass.

2115
01:30:49,396 --> 01:30:50,954
Fuck you, you can't
eat us. Fuck that, man.

2116
01:30:51,036 --> 01:30:53,869
I do whatever the fuck
I want, when I want.

2117
01:30:53,956 --> 01:30:55,548
I butt-fucked this dude.

2118
01:30:56,716 --> 01:30:57,705
See that?

2119
01:30:57,796 --> 01:30:59,388
I fucking slide
right in that shit.

2120
01:30:59,476 --> 01:31:02,230
I do whatever I want.
This is my gimp.

2121
01:31:02,317 --> 01:31:03,875
Channing,
introduce yourself.

2122
01:31:04,157 --> 01:31:05,226
Hey, what's up, guys?

2123
01:31:05,317 --> 01:31:06,716
Y'all cool?

2124
01:31:06,837 --> 01:31:08,236
That's Channing Tatum.

2125
01:31:08,317 --> 01:31:10,069
That's Channing Tatum,
dude. What the fuck?

2126
01:31:10,157 --> 01:31:12,273
Channing fucking Tatum. I found
him wandering on the freeway.

2127
01:31:12,357 --> 01:31:15,031
I collected him, made him
my bitch. Get off my dick.

2128
01:31:15,118 --> 01:31:17,950
I call him
Channing Tate-yum.

2129
01:31:18,037 --> 01:31:19,106
Hard-core, man.

2130
01:31:19,197 --> 01:31:20,266
I got him trained good.

2131
01:31:20,357 --> 01:31:21,995
Watch, he does tricks.
Wait, shake hands.

2132
01:31:22,077 --> 01:31:23,271
All right, Seth.

2133
01:31:23,397 --> 01:31:24,591
Fucking roll over.

2134
01:31:24,677 --> 01:31:26,156
I'm gonna create a diversion. Yeah.

2135
01:31:26,237 --> 01:31:28,115
You and Jay make a run for it.
What?

2136
01:31:28,198 --> 01:31:29,756
Danny's gonna eat you.

2137
01:31:29,838 --> 01:31:32,796
Listen, full-on
sacrifice for you, dawg,

2138
01:31:32,918 --> 01:31:34,909
like the ending to Pineapple 2.
Yeah, lick that.

2139
01:31:34,998 --> 01:31:36,590
That's Channing
fucking Tatum, dawg.

2140
01:31:37,078 --> 01:31:38,193
I love him.

2141
01:31:38,278 --> 01:31:41,237
That's fucking G.I. Joe,
dude. Fucking loves me.

2142
01:31:41,559 --> 01:31:44,073
Danny! We're friends!
You can't eat us!

2143
01:31:44,159 --> 01:31:48,675
I'd love to catch up, but we're
fucking starving, so let's eat!

2144
01:31:48,799 --> 01:31:49,834
Fuck you!

2145
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:53,033
Run!

2146
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:56,315
Eat this!

2147
01:31:57,160 --> 01:31:59,832
Ow! Shit, fuck!
Get him!

2148
01:32:01,079 --> 01:32:02,307
Who wants it,
you piece of shit?

2149
01:32:02,439 --> 01:32:03,713
Man, we should go back.

2150
01:32:03,759 --> 01:32:05,113
We should go back and help
him. We should go back.

2151
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:09,995
Fucking Rapture.

2152
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:12,071
Holy shit!
It worked!

2153
01:32:16,641 --> 01:32:18,074
What the fuck?

2154
01:32:18,161 --> 01:32:20,470
Go to hell, McBride!

2155
01:32:20,561 --> 01:32:22,153
Fuck you!

2156
01:32:24,161 --> 01:32:26,072
Suck my dick!

2157
01:32:26,721 --> 01:32:27,756
Ah...

2158
01:32:28,601 --> 01:32:29,717
Oh!

2159
01:32:30,522 --> 01:32:32,160
Oh, shit.
What happened?

2160
01:32:32,242 --> 01:32:34,392
What did I do?
Take me back!

2161
01:32:34,482 --> 01:32:35,471
What did I do?

2162
01:32:35,562 --> 01:32:36,551
I'll tell you what
happened, Franco.

2163
01:32:36,682 --> 01:32:38,673
You don't get to get
sucked up into Heaven

2164
01:32:38,762 --> 01:32:42,119
'cause you were being petty.
Tom Petty.

2165
01:32:42,203 --> 01:32:44,113
You may not have
invited me to your party,

2166
01:32:44,922 --> 01:32:46,514
but you're the guest
of honor at mine.

2167
01:32:46,602 --> 01:32:47,637
What?

2168
01:32:51,162 --> 01:32:52,481
How fucking
crazy is this?

2169
01:32:56,603 --> 01:32:58,321
Seth, Jay!

2170
01:32:58,403 --> 01:32:59,995
Oh, shit, they're running after us.

2171
01:33:00,123 --> 01:33:02,796
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
Oh, shit! Run.

2172
01:33:02,883 --> 01:33:04,362
Bring them to me!

2173
01:33:04,443 --> 01:33:06,799
Fuck.
Get 'em!

2174
01:33:07,324 --> 01:33:09,155
Got to get Rogen.

2175
01:33:10,484 --> 01:33:11,439
Over here.

2176
01:33:11,564 --> 01:33:13,316
What? Over here, over here. Here. What?

2177
01:33:13,404 --> 01:33:16,157
Shit, shit.

2178
01:33:16,844 --> 01:33:18,721
They're around
here somewhere.

2179
01:33:18,804 --> 01:33:20,636
They kept running,
you fucking idiots.

2180
01:33:21,125 --> 01:33:22,717
Shit, are they
still there?

2181
01:33:22,805 --> 01:33:24,318
I think they're gone.
Are they gone?

2182
01:33:24,365 --> 01:33:26,275
Oh, my God. Why did
Franco flip off Danny?

2183
01:33:26,364 --> 01:33:27,956
Why did he have
to do that, man?

2184
01:33:28,044 --> 01:33:29,079
He was in the clear.

2185
01:33:29,164 --> 01:33:30,677
That is textbook.

2186
01:33:30,764 --> 01:33:32,278
Vanity or...

2187
01:33:32,365 --> 01:33:33,593
Is it vanity?
Vanity or envy.

2188
01:33:33,685 --> 01:33:35,038
Is it envy or wrath?

2189
01:33:35,125 --> 01:33:37,161
It's any of them, man.
You can't do that.

2190
01:33:37,245 --> 01:33:38,803
It's being a sore winner,
is what it is,

2191
01:33:38,885 --> 01:33:40,204
more than anything.
That's exactly what it is.

2192
01:33:40,285 --> 01:33:41,274
You can't be a sore winner. No.

2193
01:33:42,085 --> 01:33:45,840
Well, this is another fine
mess we found ourselves in.

2194
01:33:49,246 --> 01:33:50,395
Fuck.

2195
01:33:50,846 --> 01:33:52,040
Listen, Jay...

2196
01:33:52,206 --> 01:33:54,003
Oh, shit.

2197
01:33:56,086 --> 01:33:58,237
Get out of here,
let's get out of here.

2198
01:34:02,567 --> 01:34:05,718
Oh, you've got to be
fucking shitting me!

2199
01:34:05,887 --> 01:34:09,516
Oh, my God.
Oh, no.

2200
01:34:09,607 --> 01:34:10,801
That thing's big.

2201
01:34:10,887 --> 01:34:12,002
Holy shit.

2202
01:34:12,087 --> 01:34:13,361
Oh, it's so big.

2203
01:34:13,447 --> 01:34:17,326
Oh, man.
Oh, Jesus.

2204
01:34:25,528 --> 01:34:26,643
We're gonna die, man.
Okay.

2205
01:34:26,728 --> 01:34:27,797
Okay, we're gonna die.
Uh...

2206
01:34:33,328 --> 01:34:35,240
Jesus!
Oh, no!

2207
01:34:40,929 --> 01:34:42,078
Shit.
Listen to me, man.

2208
01:34:42,169 --> 01:34:44,888
I'm a fucking idiot.
I put myself up.

2209
01:34:44,969 --> 01:34:46,288
I'm self-righteous.

2210
01:34:46,410 --> 01:34:47,889
I think I'm better than you. No, no.

2211
01:34:47,970 --> 01:34:49,119
I was resistant
to change.

2212
01:34:49,250 --> 01:34:51,205
No. I should have grown with you.

2213
01:34:51,289 --> 01:34:53,245
I should have
changed with you.

2214
01:34:53,369 --> 01:34:54,643
We should have
changed together.

2215
01:34:54,729 --> 01:34:58,085
I didn't like what I became
so I hated what you became.

2216
01:34:58,169 --> 01:34:59,922
It's fine, man.
It's fine.

2217
01:35:00,050 --> 01:35:01,847
I love you, Seth, fucking love
you, buddy. I love you, man.

2218
01:35:01,970 --> 01:35:03,403
I always loved you.
Let's die together, man.

2219
01:35:03,490 --> 01:35:05,321
Let's die together.
I love you, Jay.

2220
01:35:16,091 --> 01:35:17,524
Holy shit, Jay,
all right!

2221
01:35:17,611 --> 01:35:18,646
Yeah, we did it!

2222
01:35:18,771 --> 01:35:20,124
I'm not getting
sucked up into Heaven!

2223
01:35:20,211 --> 01:35:21,405
What do you mean?
Why not?

2224
01:35:21,491 --> 01:35:23,083
I don't know why not!

2225
01:35:23,171 --> 01:35:24,241
Take my hand!

2226
01:35:24,332 --> 01:35:25,560
Okay, take me
with you, Jay!

2227
01:35:25,652 --> 01:35:27,210
I'll take you with me.

2228
01:35:27,332 --> 01:35:28,811
Ah!
Yay!

2229
01:35:28,892 --> 01:35:30,484
Yeah!

2230
01:35:30,652 --> 01:35:31,687
Ah!

2231
01:35:31,772 --> 01:35:32,807
Whoo!

2232
01:35:34,491 --> 01:35:36,004
Yeah!
It's working!

2233
01:35:36,091 --> 01:35:37,320
Yeah!

2234
01:35:44,692 --> 01:35:47,252
Oh, no!
He sees us!

2235
01:35:49,293 --> 01:35:51,568
He can't touch us!

2236
01:35:51,653 --> 01:35:53,245
We're in a force field!

2237
01:35:57,493 --> 01:36:00,007
Oh, shit! Shit!

2238
01:36:03,814 --> 01:36:05,406
It's not gonna
take me with you!

2239
01:36:05,494 --> 01:36:06,609
We're going down!

2240
01:36:06,694 --> 01:36:09,606
Keep holding on and you'll get
pulled up, too!

2241
01:36:09,694 --> 01:36:11,605
It's not!
No, I won't, man!

2242
01:36:11,694 --> 01:36:13,366
I don't deserve to.

2243
01:36:14,015 --> 01:36:15,209
Fuck.

2244
01:36:18,934 --> 01:36:20,128
I'm gonna let go, Jay.

2245
01:36:20,214 --> 01:36:21,363
You'll die!

2246
01:36:21,454 --> 01:36:23,888
I know, but you won't.

2247
01:36:23,974 --> 01:36:25,202
No!

2248
01:36:25,294 --> 01:36:28,207
I don't deserve to go
to Heaven, but you do.

2249
01:36:28,295 --> 01:36:29,694
You do, okay?

2250
01:36:29,775 --> 01:36:31,652
We're both gonna die
if I don't let go.

2251
01:36:33,255 --> 01:36:35,564
I'm not gonna hold
you back anymore.

2252
01:36:37,855 --> 01:36:39,335
No!

2253
01:36:46,896 --> 01:36:48,887
# And I...

2254
01:36:52,057 --> 01:36:55,174
# Will always love you

2255
01:36:55,897 --> 01:36:57,216
Yay!

2256
01:36:57,417 --> 01:36:59,452
# I will always

2257
01:37:00,896 --> 01:37:03,046
# Love you

2258
01:37:03,136 --> 01:37:08,052
# I will always love you

2259
01:37:12,657 --> 01:37:14,727
Whoo! Yeah!

2260
01:37:15,257 --> 01:37:17,692
Come, hold my hand, buddy!

2261
01:37:17,778 --> 01:37:19,769
Hold my hand!

2262
01:37:19,898 --> 01:37:21,729
Yeah!
You did it!

2263
01:37:21,858 --> 01:37:23,416
You did it!
Yeah!

2264
01:37:23,498 --> 01:37:24,726
You did it!

2265
01:37:24,818 --> 01:37:27,127
Yeah!

2266
01:37:30,819 --> 01:37:32,775
We're flying!

2267
01:37:33,099 --> 01:37:35,772
# Love you #

2268
01:37:47,619 --> 01:37:50,975
# When I die
and they lay me to rest

2269
01:37:51,459 --> 01:37:54,770
# Gonna go to the place
that's the best

2270
01:37:55,180 --> 01:37:58,092
# When I lay me
down to die

2271
01:37:58,180 --> 01:37:59,215
Look!
What?

2272
01:37:59,940 --> 01:38:00,975
Wow.

2273
01:38:05,980 --> 01:38:07,858
Welcome to Heaven,
motherfuckers.

2274
01:38:08,701 --> 01:38:10,339
Craig!

2275
01:38:11,981 --> 01:38:13,812
Yay!
Yeah!

2276
01:38:14,301 --> 01:38:15,780
Craig.
Oh, my...

2277
01:38:15,861 --> 01:38:16,850
What?

2278
01:38:16,941 --> 01:38:18,010
This is awesome.

2279
01:38:18,101 --> 01:38:19,774
Are you an angel?
Yes, sir.

2280
01:38:19,862 --> 01:38:21,375
That's so cool, man.
That is so cool.

2281
01:38:21,462 --> 01:38:23,020
Congratulations, dude.

2282
01:38:23,382 --> 01:38:24,371
Ah, fellas.

2283
01:38:24,462 --> 01:38:26,179
Yeah.
Yes.

2284
01:38:26,581 --> 01:38:28,014
Oh!
Dude, you got one.

2285
01:38:28,101 --> 01:38:29,170
What?
That's so cool.

2286
01:38:29,261 --> 01:38:30,330
Do I have one?
Do I have one?

2287
01:38:30,421 --> 01:38:31,571
I can't see it.
Do I have...

2288
01:38:31,662 --> 01:38:33,175
Wait.
Let's touch 'em.

2289
01:38:34,302 --> 01:38:35,655
Dude, this is so...
Wow.

2290
01:38:35,742 --> 01:38:37,334
What do we do now?
Yeah.

2291
01:38:37,662 --> 01:38:38,651
Come this way.

2292
01:38:38,742 --> 01:38:39,970
Ooh...

2293
01:38:40,302 --> 01:38:42,896
# So you know
that when you die

2294
01:38:43,382 --> 01:38:45,180
# He's gonna recommend you

2295
01:38:45,263 --> 01:38:47,094
# To the spirit in the sky

2296
01:38:47,183 --> 01:38:48,582
# Spirit in the sky #

2297
01:38:48,663 --> 01:38:51,894
Right? Do you love it?
Do you love it?

2298
01:38:52,543 --> 01:38:54,898
Whoa, they got
weed in Heaven?

2299
01:38:54,983 --> 01:38:56,781
What?
You tell me.

2300
01:38:57,344 --> 01:38:58,379
Oh! What?

2301
01:38:58,504 --> 01:39:01,462
Holy shit!
That's awesome!

2302
01:39:02,984 --> 01:39:03,973
Oh.

2303
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:05,213
Wow.

2304
01:39:05,344 --> 01:39:06,823
That's insane, man.

2305
01:39:06,904 --> 01:39:08,256
No, no, no,
no, no, no.

2306
01:39:08,343 --> 01:39:10,938
That's Heaven. Anything
you could think of is yours.

2307
01:39:13,064 --> 01:39:14,338
Whoa!

2308
01:39:14,424 --> 01:39:17,143
Holy shit,
this is awesome.

2309
01:39:17,224 --> 01:39:18,259
Segway!

2310
01:39:18,344 --> 01:39:20,016
I've always wanted to
ride one of these things.

2311
01:39:20,104 --> 01:39:22,300
Go ahead, Jay,
make a wish.

2312
01:39:22,385 --> 01:39:23,420
Anything you
could think of.

2313
01:39:24,065 --> 01:39:25,384
Anything?

2314
01:39:27,585 --> 01:39:30,099
# Everybody, yeah

2315
01:39:32,265 --> 01:39:33,665
# Rock your body, yeah

2316
01:39:33,746 --> 01:39:34,735
What?

2317
01:39:35,986 --> 01:39:37,977
No fucking way.

2318
01:39:38,066 --> 01:39:39,579
# Everybody

2319
01:39:39,666 --> 01:39:41,816
# Rock your body right

2320
01:39:43,666 --> 01:39:45,145
# Backstreet's back

2321
01:39:45,226 --> 01:39:46,580
# All right

2322
01:39:51,066 --> 01:39:52,579
# Hey, yeah

2323
01:39:54,786 --> 01:39:57,505
# Oh, my God,
we're back again

2324
01:39:59,267 --> 01:40:02,065
# Brothers, sisters,
everybody sing

2325
01:40:03,387 --> 01:40:06,424
# Gonna bring the flavor
show you how

2326
01:40:07,947 --> 01:40:11,941
# Gotta question for you
better answer now, yeah

2327
01:40:12,068 --> 01:40:14,662
# Am I original?

2328
01:40:14,868 --> 01:40:16,096
# Yeah

2329
01:40:16,228 --> 01:40:18,901
# Am I the only one?

2330
01:40:19,268 --> 01:40:20,747
# Yeah

2331
01:40:20,828 --> 01:40:23,627
# Am I sexual?

2332
01:40:23,749 --> 01:40:25,307
# Yeah

2333
01:40:25,669 --> 01:40:27,500
# Am I everything
you need?

2334
01:40:27,589 --> 01:40:29,864
# You better
rock your body now

2335
01:40:29,949 --> 01:40:32,463
# Everybody
