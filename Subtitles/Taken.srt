1
00:01:43,419 --> 00:01:45,319
- Mr. Mills, how are you?
- I'm fine.

2
00:01:45,488 --> 00:01:46,512
- How are you?
- Fine.

3
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:49,283
- I suppose you wanna see it again?
- If you don't mind.

4
00:01:49,793 --> 00:01:51,988
- You know where it is.
- Oh, yeah.

5
00:01:52,162 --> 00:01:55,563
If I charged you a dollar every time
you came to examine the machine...

6
00:01:55,732 --> 00:01:58,724
...you'd probably own it.
It's the one all the pros use.

7
00:01:58,902 --> 00:02:01,427
Mariah Carey. Beyoncé. Gwen Stefani.

8
00:02:01,604 --> 00:02:03,799
Really? Who's Beyoncé?

9
00:02:04,073 --> 00:02:06,507
Just kidding. I'll take it.

10
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:38,104
Excuse me, sir.
The adult party's in the front.

11
00:02:38,274 --> 00:02:40,799
- I'm Kim's father.
- Excuse me, I work for her father.

12
00:02:40,977 --> 00:02:44,071
- Her real father.
- It's okay, Cyril. I got it.

13
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,340
- Hello, Bryan.
- Lenore.

14
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:50,245
I just wanted to give Kim her present.

15
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,285
We're letting the kids
have their space.

16
00:02:52,455 --> 00:02:55,424
- Put it with the others.
- I wanna give it to her myself.

17
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:58,755
- Still having trouble following the rules.
- Oh, come on, Lennie.

18
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:01,954
- I've asked you not to call me that.
- Excuse me. Lenore.

19
00:03:02,131 --> 00:03:03,621
- Dad!
- Oh, my darling.

20
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,427
- Hi.
- Hello, my sweet.

21
00:03:05,802 --> 00:03:08,066
- Happy birthday.
- I was telling your father...

22
00:03:08,238 --> 00:03:10,798
...how we arranged the presents.
- Here.

23
00:03:10,974 --> 00:03:12,771
It's bad manners to open the one...

24
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,807
...and not the others.
- Go on. Open it.

25
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,441
- Cool.
- A karaoke machine?

26
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:22,915
- Well, I figured she wants to be a singer.
- When she was 12, Bryan.

27
00:03:23,086 --> 00:03:25,520
- We've moved on.
- Thank you, Daddy.

28
00:03:25,688 --> 00:03:27,349
My pleasure.

29
00:03:27,523 --> 00:03:30,583
- I still wanna be a singer. Don't tell Mom.
- You got it.

30
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,523
Here. One for the book.

31
00:03:32,695 --> 00:03:35,493
- We have a professional photographer.
- Big smile, sweetie.

32
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:38,090
That's my girl.

33
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:48,109
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

34
00:03:48,278 --> 00:03:50,041
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

35
00:03:50,213 --> 00:03:51,475
Oh, my... Stuart!

36
00:03:52,048 --> 00:03:54,209
Stuart, I love you! I love you!
I love you!

37
00:03:54,417 --> 00:03:56,180
Happy birthday, sweetie.

38
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:10,827
- Oh, Stuart, you're impossible.
- I know.

39
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,627
- Hey, Bryan.
- Stuart.

40
00:04:13,236 --> 00:04:16,467
- She's not a little girl anymore, huh?
- I guess not.

41
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,870
- Will you join us for lunch?
- No, thanks.

42
00:04:20,043 --> 00:04:23,012
I just wanted to be here
to wish her a happy birthday.

43
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:26,207
- Good to see you, Bryan.
- You too.

44
00:04:40,663 --> 00:04:42,096
Thanks.

45
00:05:18,868 --> 00:05:19,926
- Hey.
- Hey.

46
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:22,761
You forgot.

47
00:05:23,706 --> 00:05:24,730
Come on in.

48
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:28,206
It's not like I didn't call to remind you.
Third Saturday in May?

49
00:05:28,378 --> 00:05:31,870
- Red meat, red wine? Sound familiar?
- He probably had a lot on his mind.

50
00:05:32,048 --> 00:05:35,142
Yeah, the busy life of a retiree.
Every day a new adventure.

51
00:05:35,318 --> 00:05:38,754
What does a retiree do, anyway?
Take naps? Play golf?

52
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:41,412
- Hit on rich widows?
- That takes care of the morning.

53
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,082
Yeah, well, come on, guys.
You know why I'm here.

54
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,818
Yeah, how's that going?

55
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:47,826
Okay. We had her birthday today.

56
00:05:48,031 --> 00:05:49,521
Can you believe my Kimmy's 17?

57
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,463
Seventeen?

58
00:05:53,336 --> 00:05:56,169
- To Kim.
- Lennie still got a hard-on for you?

59
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,338
She's not Lennie anymore.
She's Lenore.

60
00:05:59,542 --> 00:06:01,100
Oh, she's still got a hard-on.

61
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:03,677
- And the husband?
- The same. Perfect.

62
00:06:03,846 --> 00:06:07,475
- Dig deep enough, there's always shit.
- We can dig if you want us to dig.

63
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,914
What, you think he hasn't
done it already?

64
00:06:10,086 --> 00:06:11,314
Thank you, Bernie.

65
00:06:11,487 --> 00:06:14,354
- How's Kimmy?
- Good. She's good.

66
00:06:14,557 --> 00:06:16,650
Yeah? She sleep over yet?

67
00:06:16,859 --> 00:06:19,350
Well, let's say we're working on it.

68
00:06:19,862 --> 00:06:23,093
She appreciate the fact
that you've given up your life...

69
00:06:23,266 --> 00:06:25,632
...in order to be closer to her?

70
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:27,864
What a life, huh?

71
00:06:28,438 --> 00:06:30,963
Hey, remember Beirut
after the chief disappeared?

72
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,700
Bry was in deep with that
crazy sheik from Hezbollah?

73
00:06:33,876 --> 00:06:36,208
The guy said he'd get us inside
then disappeared.

74
00:06:36,379 --> 00:06:38,279
We're scrambling to get the hell out...

75
00:06:38,448 --> 00:06:40,643
...before we get taken down
and where are you?

76
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,682
I promised never to miss her birthday.

77
00:06:42,852 --> 00:06:44,945
Yeah, that went down well
at Langley...

78
00:06:45,121 --> 00:06:47,214
...when they found out
you flew the coop...

79
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:50,188
...to attend your child's birthday
9000 miles away.

80
00:06:50,393 --> 00:06:52,293
Where did you say
your next posting was?

81
00:06:52,462 --> 00:06:55,192
The Arctic Circle spying on penguins,
I believe it was.

82
00:06:55,364 --> 00:06:57,025
No, penguins live in Antarctica.

83
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,668
Actually, it was Alaska.
What's your point, Sam?

84
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:04,239
My point is we have an open space.
Say the word, it's yours.

85
00:07:06,242 --> 00:07:07,971
Who likes theirs rare?

86
00:07:08,711 --> 00:07:09,837
- Guys.
- See you, Bryan.

87
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:12,242
- Good night, guys.
- See you, Bry.

88
00:07:12,415 --> 00:07:14,508
Hey, look, look, look.
All kidding aside...

89
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:17,812
...it's a great thing trying to make up
for lost time with Kimmy.

90
00:07:17,987 --> 00:07:19,852
But tomorrow's job? Right here.

91
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:21,649
Four hours' work, 2500 bucks...

92
00:07:21,824 --> 00:07:24,816
...just for taking some pop diva
to and from her concert.

93
00:07:24,994 --> 00:07:26,484
- We're one short.
- A singer?

94
00:07:26,662 --> 00:07:29,688
I don't know if you'd call her a singer.
More like a cash cow.

95
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:32,767
Twenty million records sold already
and she's not even 25.

96
00:07:32,935 --> 00:07:34,197
Job's a piece of cake.

97
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:37,533
We get her there and back.
Inside, they've got their own people.

98
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,834
- Okay.
- Okay. Okay?

99
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:41,067
- Yeah.
- Like that's it?

100
00:07:41,244 --> 00:07:42,438
Yeah.

101
00:07:42,645 --> 00:07:46,376
- It'll be perfect. Just like old times.
- Better. No one gets killed.

102
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:50,017
- Tomorrow. Good night, guys.
- See you.

103
00:07:50,186 --> 00:07:53,519
- Get in the back, Wendy.
- I always get in the back.

104
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,442
Ma'am, if you don't mind,
I suggest you keep moving.

105
00:08:23,619 --> 00:08:25,712
My mother is ma'am,
if you don't mind.

106
00:08:29,292 --> 00:08:32,056
- Come on, it's time now. Let's go.
- Okay.

107
00:08:33,462 --> 00:08:36,295
Bernie, Casey, you're out here.
Bry, you're in the room.

108
00:08:36,465 --> 00:08:38,057
Okay.

109
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,904
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

110
00:08:42,071 --> 00:08:43,902
Thank you for coming.

111
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,950
Wow, it was beautiful.

112
00:09:00,523 --> 00:09:03,117
Thanks. What did you say
your name was again?

113
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:04,850
Mills. Bryan Mills.

114
00:09:05,027 --> 00:09:07,723
- Nice to meet you, Bryan Mills.
- You too.

115
00:09:08,664 --> 00:09:11,792
- You're on. Come on, let's go now.
- Okay, guys.

116
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:12,992
Excuse me, miss.

117
00:09:13,169 --> 00:09:17,629
I've a daughter who wants to be a singer
and was wondering if you had any tips.

118
00:09:18,841 --> 00:09:20,433
Yeah, I do.

119
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,771
Tell her to pick another career.

120
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,946
I got one.
We're waiting on an air strike...

121
00:09:28,117 --> 00:09:30,984
...and we're waiting
and then my satellite phone rings.

122
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:32,177
- Who is it?
- Hello?

123
00:09:32,355 --> 00:09:34,152
- The guy we're to terminate.
- Honey.

124
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:37,349
- He'd like to know if we want some tea.
- Sorry, guys, it's Kim.

125
00:09:39,262 --> 00:09:40,889
The noise?

126
00:09:41,063 --> 00:09:43,156
I'm at a concert.

127
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:46,359
You know this song? Yeah?

128
00:09:46,535 --> 00:09:49,698
Yep, that's her.
No, no, no, I'm not attending.

129
00:09:49,872 --> 00:09:51,339
I'm... I'm not attending.

130
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:54,135
I'm helping some friends out
with security.

131
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,335
Well, of course I met her.

132
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,173
Who do you think's guarding her?

133
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,508
I'm glad you're impressed.

134
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,913
Hey, I'm happy you called.

135
00:10:03,085 --> 00:10:06,350
I'm happy you called. What?

136
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,854
Lunch? Tomorrow?

137
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:12,657
Sure, sure. I know the place.

138
00:10:12,828 --> 00:10:15,058
Twelve-thirty it is.

139
00:10:15,665 --> 00:10:17,189
I'll see you then.

140
00:10:17,733 --> 00:10:19,564
- Here he is. And?
- What happened?

141
00:10:19,735 --> 00:10:21,566
- She wants to have lunch.
- Okay.

142
00:10:21,737 --> 00:10:23,932
- Just the two of us.
- All right. Fantastic.

143
00:10:24,106 --> 00:10:25,869
See? There's progress. That's great.

144
00:10:39,588 --> 00:10:42,785
Who left that gate open?
Bry, get her out of here. Take the lead.

145
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:44,050
- Move!
- Go, go!

146
00:10:46,462 --> 00:10:47,793
More security here now!

147
00:10:47,963 --> 00:10:49,590
That's it. Move.

148
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:58,103
Casey!

149
00:11:00,042 --> 00:11:01,907
Bernie, stand by, stand by.

150
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,137
- Go, go, go.
- Watch your head.

151
00:11:08,284 --> 00:11:11,720
Here, take this. The sugar will
take the edge off the shock.

152
00:11:11,887 --> 00:11:14,151
Come on, come on, drink some more.

153
00:11:23,366 --> 00:11:25,163
It's okay. It's okay. You're safe.

154
00:11:31,073 --> 00:11:32,631
You're safe now.

155
00:11:35,077 --> 00:11:36,305
Bernie.

156
00:11:36,479 --> 00:11:38,447
Casey. Rambo.

157
00:11:39,415 --> 00:11:41,975
Seriously, Bry,
you should think about coming with us.

158
00:11:42,151 --> 00:11:44,745
You've got the edge.
There's more of this to be had.

159
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,820
- She's going to college next year?
- Yep.

160
00:11:46,989 --> 00:11:50,083
- You're gonna lose her.
- That gives me a year to find her.

161
00:11:50,826 --> 00:11:53,659
Mr. Mills, she'd like to see you.

162
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,766
- How are you feeling?
- Better.

163
00:12:04,507 --> 00:12:06,338
So your daughter
wants to be a singer?

164
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,638
Yep, since she was 5.

165
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,609
It's not what everyone thinks it is.

166
00:12:11,781 --> 00:12:16,980
Once the glam wears off, it's just
a lot of hotel rooms, lots of airports.

167
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,646
It's what she wants.

168
00:12:22,691 --> 00:12:24,852
The first number is Gio,
my vocal coach.

169
00:12:25,027 --> 00:12:27,018
If he says she can sing, she can sing.

170
00:12:27,196 --> 00:12:29,790
He'll give her coaching she needs,
the fee is on me.

171
00:12:29,965 --> 00:12:31,899
The second number is my manager.

172
00:12:32,067 --> 00:12:34,661
If Gio clears her,
he'll make sure she gets a shot.

173
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,973
- Thank you.
- No, Mr. Mills, thank you.

174
00:12:57,326 --> 00:12:59,487
- There she is.
- Dad.

175
00:13:02,565 --> 00:13:04,465
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hey.

176
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,865
- Hi.
- Hi.

177
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,435
Don't look so excited.

178
00:13:08,604 --> 00:13:12,062
I was just surprised.
I thought it was just gonna be Kim and I.

179
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,837
I asked Mom to come.

180
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:19,609
One raspberry-banana milkshake,
extra cherries, just the way you like it.

181
00:13:19,782 --> 00:13:21,215
- Thanks.
- Lennie... Lenore.

182
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:24,079
- Would you like something?
- I'm fine, thanks.

183
00:13:24,587 --> 00:13:26,111
So?

184
00:13:26,689 --> 00:13:28,122
So, Dad, guess what.

185
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:29,917
- You know my friend Amanda?
- Yep.

186
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:33,785
Her cousins asked us to spend vacation
with them in Paris.

187
00:13:33,996 --> 00:13:35,020
How cool is that?

188
00:13:35,197 --> 00:13:37,722
- Why do you want to go to Paris?
- Dad. Hello?

189
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,199
The Louvre, the Impressionist museum,
the Picasso Museum.

190
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:43,235
I didn't know you were so into art.

191
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:46,431
Are you kidding? I've been to the MOMA,
like, a hundred times.

192
00:13:46,609 --> 00:13:51,376
Amanda went last summer, she came
back, she could practically speak French.

193
00:13:53,782 --> 00:13:55,249
And because you're under 18...

194
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:58,250
...you need my permission
to leave the country?

195
00:13:58,821 --> 00:14:02,257
Dad, please. I really, really wanna go.

196
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:05,257
They've got this
sick apartment overlooking the river.

197
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:07,895
- Just you and Amanda?
- And her cousins.

198
00:14:08,063 --> 00:14:11,294
Don't make a big deal out of this, Bryan.
Just sign the paper.

199
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,766
- What?
- I'm not comfortable with this.

200
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,670
- Dad.
- I know the world, sweetie.

201
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:24,007
- Dad, please.
- A 17-year-old should not travel alone.

202
00:14:24,179 --> 00:14:26,409
- I'm not gonna be alone.
- Two 17-year-olds.

203
00:14:26,582 --> 00:14:28,573
Amanda's 19.

204
00:14:34,156 --> 00:14:36,681
How about this?
How about if I go along?

205
00:14:36,859 --> 00:14:39,692
You won't know I'm there.
I'm very good at being invisible.

206
00:14:39,862 --> 00:14:43,161
As you so amply demonstrated
for most of her life.

207
00:14:43,332 --> 00:14:44,924
Just sign the paper, Bryan.

208
00:14:48,203 --> 00:14:49,329
I'll think about it.

209
00:14:49,505 --> 00:14:51,700
Everyone at this table
knows what that means.

210
00:14:52,675 --> 00:14:55,143
Hey, Kimmy, there's something else.

211
00:14:55,945 --> 00:14:58,436
- I don't want anything else.
- Kim.

212
00:15:05,087 --> 00:15:06,349
- I don't get you.
- What?

213
00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:09,853
You sacrificed our marriage
in the service of the country.

214
00:15:10,025 --> 00:15:12,789
You made a mess of your life
in service of your country.

215
00:15:12,962 --> 00:15:15,795
Can't you sacrifice a little
this time for your daughter?

216
00:15:15,965 --> 00:15:18,832
- I would sacrifice anything for her.
- What's your problem?

217
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:22,300
I'm not comfortable
putting my daughter at risk.

218
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:26,471
Putting our daughter at risk
by going to Paris?

219
00:15:26,809 --> 00:15:28,902
You're pathetic.

220
00:15:44,326 --> 00:15:47,124
- She's coming.
- Thanks.

221
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,390
Three conditions.

222
00:15:51,734 --> 00:15:54,396
The address and phone number
of where you're staying.

223
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:57,539
You move, I wanna know where
and with whom you'll be staying.

224
00:15:57,706 --> 00:16:01,267
Call me when you land. Call me
every night before you go to sleep.

225
00:16:01,443 --> 00:16:03,206
It's international. My number is in.

226
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,506
- Okay, awesome.
- Kimmy, you're not focused.

227
00:16:05,681 --> 00:16:06,943
- I am.
- What did I say?

228
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:10,448
You said call you when I land,
every night before I go to sleep...

229
00:16:10,653 --> 00:16:13,451
...your phone's international,
the number's programmed in.

230
00:16:13,656 --> 00:16:16,784
Okay, one last thing.
I get to take you to the airport.

231
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,449
Okay.

232
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,226
- There you go.
- Yes.

233
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:24,730
Thank you, Daddy.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

234
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,595
Mom!

235
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,695
I love you, Dad.

236
00:16:30,539 --> 00:16:33,906
Mom, he signed it, he signed it.
I'm gonna go call Amanda!

237
00:16:37,713 --> 00:16:40,409
Wouldn't it have been easier
to sign the first time?

238
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:44,211
Wouldn't it have been easier
if you and I had talked about it first?

239
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:51,384
Certain areas in Paris you should avoid.
I've written them down.

240
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,788
- Dad.
- Come on, take it.

241
00:16:52,961 --> 00:16:56,761
We're gonna be spending 90 percent
of our time in museums. Don't worry.

242
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:59,628
That's like telling water
not to be wet, sweetie.

243
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,831
Mom says
your job made you paranoid.

244
00:17:02,004 --> 00:17:03,733
Well, my job made me aware.

245
00:17:05,474 --> 00:17:08,932
I used to ask Mom what your job was
that you were away all the time.

246
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,443
And she would tell me to ask you.

247
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:15,242
Whenever I did see you,
I was afraid to ask.

248
00:17:15,417 --> 00:17:17,146
Yeah? Why?

249
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,818
I don't know. Maybe because...

250
00:17:21,423 --> 00:17:23,653
...I was afraid to find out.

251
00:17:25,494 --> 00:17:27,655
Like, maybe it was something
I wouldn't like.

252
00:17:28,263 --> 00:17:31,164
I worked for the government.
You knew that.

253
00:17:31,667 --> 00:17:35,933
So you were like a spy, right?

254
00:17:36,105 --> 00:17:39,541
- What happens if I push this button?
- Don't touch that button.

255
00:17:40,275 --> 00:17:45,611
Well, no, I was a...
I was a preventer, actually.

256
00:17:45,781 --> 00:17:47,612
- A preventer?
- Yeah.

257
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,945
What did you prevent?

258
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:52,110
Bad things from happening.

259
00:17:52,554 --> 00:17:56,684
So it was a good job?

260
00:17:56,859 --> 00:17:59,657
Yes. Yep, it was.

261
00:18:01,897 --> 00:18:03,626
Do you miss it?

262
00:18:04,199 --> 00:18:05,461
I missed you more.

263
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:22,849
- Kim!
- Dad, there's Amanda.

264
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:24,849
Go ahead. I'll get the bags.

265
00:18:46,742 --> 00:18:49,267
- Jimmy'll give you a hand with those.
- I can manage.

266
00:18:49,444 --> 00:18:50,877
Lenore.

267
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:53,879
Do you know about this?
She's not just going to Paris.

268
00:18:54,683 --> 00:18:56,207
- I know.
- She lied to me.

269
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,546
Yes, because she can't be honest
with you.

270
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,779
Why? What are you talking about?

271
00:19:00,956 --> 00:19:02,617
Your rules and conditions.

272
00:19:02,825 --> 00:19:04,087
What is this?

273
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:07,023
It's U2's European tour dates.

274
00:19:07,196 --> 00:19:09,187
She's following a rock band
around Europe?

275
00:19:09,364 --> 00:19:13,061
All kids do. Stuart got her tickets,
arranged her to stay in the best hotels.

276
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:16,398
Best hotels. You know,
you live in your little bubble here...

277
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:19,939
...behind your wall, with your maids
and chauffeurs and servants.

278
00:19:20,108 --> 00:19:21,598
No idea what the world is like.

279
00:19:21,777 --> 00:19:25,577
Yes, and neither will she
unless she goes out and experiences it.

280
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,715
Don't tell me I don't know the world.

281
00:19:29,885 --> 00:19:33,821
For five years I waited for a phone call
that didn't come for weeks at a time.

282
00:19:33,989 --> 00:19:37,049
For a knock on the door
telling me there'd be no calls anymore.

283
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:45,256
Listen, I know you moved here to build
some sort of relationship with Kimmy.

284
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:48,267
But you're not gonna do that
by smothering her.

285
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:51,964
Let her live, or I promise,
I promise you'll lose her.

286
00:19:58,981 --> 00:20:00,005
Girls.

287
00:20:05,654 --> 00:20:06,814
Kim!

288
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:13,818
I love you.

289
00:20:15,697 --> 00:20:17,995
Let's go. Come on.

290
00:20:30,112 --> 00:20:31,977
I'll teach you the French words
I know.

291
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:34,707
- Which may not be that much, but...
- Okay. Yeah, right.

292
00:20:39,688 --> 00:20:41,713
Three. Okay, now take one...

293
00:20:41,924 --> 00:20:43,858
Need some help?
One with the two of you?

294
00:20:44,426 --> 00:20:46,360
Yes, please.

295
00:20:46,528 --> 00:20:48,553
- Okay.
- He's really cute.

296
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:51,494
Okay. Yeah, great. Very nice.

297
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:52,691
Where are you from?

298
00:20:53,201 --> 00:20:54,930
California.

299
00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:01,867
No. I'm Peter.

300
00:21:07,716 --> 00:21:09,547
- This is Kim.
- Hi.

301
00:21:09,718 --> 00:21:10,878
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

302
00:21:11,053 --> 00:21:12,520
Hey.

303
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:15,156
You're going into Paris?

304
00:21:15,824 --> 00:21:18,258
You know, taxis here
are so damned expensive.

305
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,586
Want to share?

306
00:21:19,761 --> 00:21:21,558
- Yeah. Sure.
- Okay, perfect.

307
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:23,561
Thanks.

00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:31,361
<i>Please enter the flight number.</i>

310
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:36,909
<i>Flight 288 arrived</i>
<i>in Paris Charles de Gaulle...</i>

311
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:40,606
<i>... at 8 a.m. local time.</i>

312
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,249
Yeah.

313
00:21:43,418 --> 00:21:45,909
Oh, are you serious?

314
00:21:46,088 --> 00:21:48,386
- Oh, my God.
- Nice address.

315
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:49,922
Oh, yeah, thanks.

316
00:21:50,092 --> 00:21:54,222
It's my cousins', but they're in Madrid,
so we have the whole place to ourselves.

317
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:55,954
How cool is that?

318
00:21:56,131 --> 00:21:58,759
- I didn't know that.
- It's no biggie.

319
00:21:58,934 --> 00:22:00,959
Well, I have to be going.

320
00:22:01,136 --> 00:22:02,865
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh, okay.

321
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:04,096
- You too.
- Bye.

322
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,266
Hey.

323
00:22:07,209 --> 00:22:09,871
There is a party tonight at school.
Want to come?

324
00:22:10,045 --> 00:22:11,774
- Sure. Yeah.
- We don't even know him.

325
00:22:11,947 --> 00:22:14,142
What is there to know? He's hot.

326
00:22:14,316 --> 00:22:16,443
- I come pick you up around 9?
- Okay, yeah.

327
00:22:16,618 --> 00:22:18,643
Okay, great. Your apartment?

328
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:22,415
- It's the whole fifth floor. Hoffmann.
- Okay. See you tonight. Bye.

329
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,218
Bye.

330
00:22:32,634 --> 00:22:33,726
Yeah.

331
00:22:34,669 --> 00:22:35,727
Fifth floor.

332
00:22:35,904 --> 00:22:38,566
Two girls around 18.

333
00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:42,936
Oh, my God.

334
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:46,239
- How sick is this?
- Are you kidding me? It's great.

335
00:22:46,415 --> 00:22:49,282
I just wish you would've told me
they weren't gonna be here.

336
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:52,113
- What's the difference?
- I told my dad they'd be here.

337
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:54,585
You told your dad you were
going to museums too.

338
00:22:54,756 --> 00:22:56,587
Oh, come on. He's not gonna know.

339
00:22:57,826 --> 00:22:59,589
- I'm gonna sleep with him.
- Who?

340
00:22:59,761 --> 00:23:01,251
- Peter.
- You just met him.

341
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:04,789
I hear French guys are amazing in bed.

342
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:07,332
- Maybe he has a friend, huh?
- No.

343
00:23:07,502 --> 00:23:08,696
- No.
- Oh, come on.

344
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:12,670
You gotta lose it sometime.
Might as well be in Paris.

345
00:23:17,179 --> 00:23:18,339
Hey!

346
00:23:38,133 --> 00:23:40,328
- Amanda, where's the bathroom?
- What?

347
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:41,594
I have to pee!

348
00:24:07,729 --> 00:24:09,822
- Hello?
- It's me. Has Kim called you?

349
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:14,828
Bryan, she's 17. She's in Paris.
Give her some space.

350
00:24:15,003 --> 00:24:17,267
<i>She'll call. Take a sleeping pill.</i>

351
00:24:17,439 --> 00:24:19,566
Have a drink or something. Good night.

352
00:24:20,509 --> 00:24:22,374
Good night.

353
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,552
Hi, Daddy.

354
00:24:40,529 --> 00:24:42,292
Kim.

355
00:24:43,865 --> 00:24:46,390
What did I say?
You were supposed to call me.

356
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:47,592
I'm sorry.

357
00:24:47,769 --> 00:24:50,033
<i>I thought something was wrong</i>
<i>with the phone.</i>

358
00:24:50,205 --> 00:24:52,901
- No. It was such a rush at the airport.
- All right.

359
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:55,736
Well, if I'd had the number
where you were staying...

360
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,572
<i>... I would've just called there.</i>

361
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:58,804
<i>What's the number?</i>

362
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,574
- <i>I don't have it.</i>
- Kimmy, come on.

363
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,548
<i>This is one of the conditions.</i>
<i>Let me talk to the cousins.</i>

364
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:06,380
<i>I'll get it from them.</i>

365
00:25:06,555 --> 00:25:10,218
Dad, they're in Spain.
I didn't know. I swear.

366
00:25:10,725 --> 00:25:12,454
To Spain?

367
00:25:13,695 --> 00:25:17,187
Kim, is there anything else
you want to tell me?

368
00:25:20,569 --> 00:25:22,469
Kimmy.

369
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:29,433
- There's someone here.
- The cousins are back?

370
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:31,340
No.

371
00:25:32,147 --> 00:25:34,581
- Oh, my God. They got Amanda.
- What?

372
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:37,311
<i>What are you talking about? Kimmy?</i>

373
00:25:37,485 --> 00:25:38,747
- Dad.
- <i>Kim.</i>

374
00:25:40,355 --> 00:25:42,653
- <i>Kim.</i>
- Dad. They took her.

375
00:25:42,824 --> 00:25:45,122
- <i>They took her.</i>
- All right, listen to me.

376
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:46,760
Oh, God.

377
00:25:46,928 --> 00:25:49,522
- Did you meet anyone on the plane?
- No.

378
00:25:49,731 --> 00:25:52,757
- In the airport?
- No. Yes, Peter.

379
00:25:52,934 --> 00:25:54,595
- Peter? Peter who?
- <i>I don't know.</i>

380
00:25:54,769 --> 00:25:55,929
- An American?
- <i>No.</i>

381
00:25:56,104 --> 00:25:58,129
Did he know where you were staying?

382
00:25:58,306 --> 00:25:59,796
He took a cab with us.

383
00:26:02,377 --> 00:26:05,471
Dad, they're coming.

384
00:26:06,014 --> 00:26:08,676
- <i>Please, I'm scared.</i>
- I know you are.

385
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:11,216
Stay focused, Kimmy.
You have to hold it together.

386
00:26:11,386 --> 00:26:12,944
How many people are there?

387
00:26:13,121 --> 00:26:15,612
- Three, four. I don't know.
- Where are you?

388
00:26:17,259 --> 00:26:19,693
- I'm in the bathroom.
- Go to the next bedroom.

389
00:26:19,861 --> 00:26:22,557
Get under the bed.
Tell me when you're there.

390
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:34,406
- I'm here.
- Now, the next part is very important.

391
00:26:37,712 --> 00:26:41,580
They are going to take you.
Kim, stay focused, baby. This is key.

392
00:26:41,783 --> 00:26:45,219
You will have five, maybe ten seconds.
Very important seconds.

393
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,911
<i>Leave the phone on the floor.</i>
<i>Concentrate.</i>

394
00:26:48,089 --> 00:26:52,150
Shout out everything you see about them.
Hair color, eye color, tall, short, scars.

395
00:26:52,327 --> 00:26:54,693
Anything you see. You understand?

396
00:26:58,433 --> 00:27:00,094
They're there. I can hear them.

397
00:27:00,302 --> 00:27:02,099
<i>Remember, concentrate.</i>

398
00:27:15,183 --> 00:27:17,014
Put the phone closer so I can hear.

399
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:45,270
They're leaving. I think they're...

400
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:54,087
<i>Beard. Six feet.</i>
<i>Tattoo right hand, moon and star.</i>

401
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:17,237
I don't know who you are.

402
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:20,672
I don't know what you want.

403
00:28:20,882 --> 00:28:24,784
If you are looking for a ransom,
I can tell you, I don't have money.

404
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:29,356
But what I do have
are a very particular set of skills.

405
00:28:29,524 --> 00:28:32,357
Skills I've acquired
over a very long career.

406
00:28:32,527 --> 00:28:36,395
Skills that make me a nightmare
for people like you.

407
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:40,298
If you let my daughter go now,
that'll be the end of it.

408
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:44,336
I will not look for you.
I will not pursue you.

409
00:28:44,506 --> 00:28:48,306
But if you don't, I will look for you.

410
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:51,206
I will find you...

411
00:28:51,413 --> 00:28:53,711
...and I will kill you.

412
00:28:57,552 --> 00:28:59,520
<i>Good luck.</i>

413
00:29:10,732 --> 00:29:12,893
Sam, it's me. I need a favor.

414
00:29:13,067 --> 00:29:17,163
I'm gonna download something.
I need it analyzed. Right now.

415
00:29:17,939 --> 00:29:19,531
- She's been taken.
- What?

416
00:29:19,707 --> 00:29:22,039
- Any enemies overseas?
- Why would I have enemies?

417
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:25,145
You do business overseas
through multiple shell corporations.

418
00:29:25,313 --> 00:29:28,908
You were involved in an oil deal with
a bunch of Russians that went south.

419
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:31,881
- How do you know that?
- I was not gonna let my daughter...

420
00:29:32,053 --> 00:29:34,886
...live with someone without knowing
everything about them.

421
00:29:35,056 --> 00:29:38,219
- I have a few resources...
- Now is not the time for dick measuring.

422
00:29:38,393 --> 00:29:40,554
- Anyone looking to hurt you?
- Not that I know.

423
00:29:40,728 --> 00:29:42,696
- Which room's Kim's?
- What happened?

424
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:46,356
I got a call from her. There were people
in the apartment. She was taken.

425
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:47,899
- Oh, God.
- Which one?

426
00:29:48,069 --> 00:29:49,696
That one.

427
00:29:53,908 --> 00:29:55,705
Is there something I should be doing?

428
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:58,778
You have a lease agreement
with NetJet through your company.

429
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,504
I do.

430
00:30:01,015 --> 00:30:02,880
- Get me a plane to Paris.
- For when?

431
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,177
An hour ago.

432
00:30:04,352 --> 00:30:07,753
- I'm gonna make the call. You all right?
- Yeah, yeah. I'm okay.

433
00:30:16,498 --> 00:30:19,899
Would you please
get her back to me, Bryan?

434
00:30:20,602 --> 00:30:21,796
First I have to find her.

435
00:30:26,107 --> 00:30:28,701
Sam, what have you got?

436
00:30:28,877 --> 00:30:30,105
<i>They're speaking Albanian.</i>

437
00:30:30,278 --> 00:30:33,714
Based on their accents and dialects,
they must be from Tropoja.

438
00:30:33,882 --> 00:30:35,713
<i>The place is ground zero</i>
<i>for scummers.</i>

439
00:30:35,884 --> 00:30:38,114
<i>Even the Russians</i>
<i>give these guys a wide berth.</i>

440
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:41,085
The one you spoke to,
his name is Marko.

441
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,247
We have information
that a mobster boss...

442
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:46,621
...by the name of Marko Hoxha
moved to Paris about six months ago.

443
00:30:46,794 --> 00:30:52,562
<i>If he's the one, he's a big fish.</i>
<i>The tattoo, by the way, is a group ID.</i>

444
00:30:52,734 --> 00:30:55,635
- <i>Am I on speaker or are you by yourself?</i>
- Lenore is here.

445
00:30:56,137 --> 00:30:59,072
- <i>Hey, Lennie.</i>
- Hello, Sam.

446
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:00,639
She needs to hear it, Sam.

447
00:31:01,576 --> 00:31:05,603
The specialty of the groups coming out
of this area is trafficking in women.

448
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:11,411
- Keep going.
- Okay.

449
00:31:11,586 --> 00:31:16,353
Their previous m.o. was to offer women
from emerging East European countries...

450
00:31:16,558 --> 00:31:20,585
<i>... like Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria,</i>
<i>jobs in the West as maids and nannies.</i>

451
00:31:20,762 --> 00:31:25,199
Once smuggled in, they'd addict them
to drugs and turn them into prostitutes.

452
00:31:26,668 --> 00:31:29,603
Lately, however, they've decided
that it's more economical...

453
00:31:29,771 --> 00:31:34,640
...just to kidnap traveling young women.
Saves on transportation costs.

454
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:37,209
Oh, my little baby.

455
00:31:37,378 --> 00:31:38,936
What else?

456
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:42,207
Based on the way these groups operate,
our analyst says...

457
00:31:42,383 --> 00:31:45,216
...you have a 96-hour window
from the time she was grabbed.

458
00:31:45,386 --> 00:31:47,854
- To what?
- To never finding her.

459
00:31:48,022 --> 00:31:51,116
No, no, no.

460
00:31:51,292 --> 00:31:52,953
<i>Daddy!</i>

461
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:57,392
<i>Mustache. Six feet.</i>
<i>Tattoo on right hand, moon and star.</i>

462
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:59,226
<i>Da...</i>

463
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,031
<i>Good luck.</i>

464
00:32:10,912 --> 00:32:12,641
<i>Good luck.</i>

465
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:15,839
<i>Good luck.</i>

466
00:32:17,485 --> 00:32:18,713
<i>Good luck.</i>

467
00:33:57,652 --> 00:33:59,415
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

468
00:34:01,656 --> 00:34:03,351
<i>Dad, they got Amanda.</i>

469
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:15,493
<i>Oh, God.</i>

470
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:19,535
<i>Dad, they got her.</i>

471
00:34:22,343 --> 00:34:23,503
<i>They took her.</i>

472
00:34:23,678 --> 00:34:25,976
<i>Go to the next bedroom.</i>
<i>Get under the bed.</i>

473
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:29,514
- <i>Tell me when you're there.</i>
- <i>I'm here.</i>

474
00:34:35,556 --> 00:34:38,457
<i>Stay focused, baby.</i>
<i>Leave the phone on the floor.</i>

475
00:34:38,626 --> 00:34:41,117
<i>Concentrate. Shout out</i>
<i>everything you see about them.</i>

476
00:34:41,295 --> 00:34:45,163
<i>Hair color, eye color, tall, short, scars.</i>
<i>Anything you see. You understand?</i>

477
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:48,302
<i>They're there. I can hear them.</i>
<i>Remember, concentrate.</i>

478
00:35:01,549 --> 00:35:04,382
<i>They're leaving. Daddy!</i>

479
00:35:07,321 --> 00:35:08,583
<i>Dad!</i>

480
00:35:09,557 --> 00:35:12,993
Beard. Six feet.
Tattoo right hand, moon and star.

481
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:14,786
Dad!

482
00:36:56,597 --> 00:36:57,689
- Hi.
- Hi.

483
00:36:57,899 --> 00:36:59,491
- I'm Peter.
- I'm Ingrid.

484
00:36:59,667 --> 00:37:00,964
- On holidays?
- Yes.

485
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:02,830
- Me too.
- Cool.

486
00:37:03,004 --> 00:37:05,472
Cabs here are so damned expensive.
Want to share?

487
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,972
- Sure. Why not?
- Great.

488
00:37:10,111 --> 00:37:12,170
- Excuse me.
- Hey.

489
00:37:14,849 --> 00:37:16,043
- Hey.
- Drive.

490
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,315
- The two American girls from yesterday?
- I don't know.

491
00:37:22,023 --> 00:37:26,119
The next rib drives into your lungs.
The two American girls, where are they?

492
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:30,917
- Just like the old days.
- Would you have it any other way?

493
00:39:31,085 --> 00:39:32,518
Between you and me? No.

494
00:39:32,686 --> 00:39:36,019
But now that I sit behind a desk,
the world looks different.

495
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:38,488
- You mean, looks boring.
- I mean different.

496
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:43,019
Okay, a little boring. But is being retired
any more interesting?

497
00:39:43,197 --> 00:39:46,598
It wasn't. Until my daughter
disappeared in Paris yesterday.

498
00:39:46,767 --> 00:39:50,703
She and her friend were marked by a
spotter at the airport. Albanians took her.

499
00:39:50,871 --> 00:39:53,169
- How do you know this?
- I'm retired, not dead.

500
00:39:53,707 --> 00:39:56,107
And I assume you don't want
to go to the police.

501
00:39:56,277 --> 00:39:59,041
I was told I have 96 hours.
That was 16 hours ago.

502
00:39:59,213 --> 00:40:03,149
- Okay, first, we should find the spotter.
- I found him, he's dead.

503
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:07,952
You found him that way?

504
00:40:10,591 --> 00:40:13,992
Bryan, you cannot just run around
tearing down Paris...

505
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:16,322
I'll tear down the Eiffel Tower
if I have to.

506
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:19,159
- Don't forget who you talk to.
- I'm talking to a friend.

507
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:24,396
You are. But please remember,
your friend has a desk now.

508
00:40:24,605 --> 00:40:28,063
"Deputy director, Internal Security."
Very impressive.

509
00:40:28,242 --> 00:40:30,210
The Albanians?

510
00:40:30,478 --> 00:40:33,311
They showed up from the East,
six, seven years ago.

511
00:40:33,481 --> 00:40:35,847
Fifteen, 20 of them.
Now there are hundreds.

512
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:38,712
We don't even know how many.
And dangerous.

513
00:40:38,886 --> 00:40:41,616
So I heard. Where do I find them?

514
00:40:41,822 --> 00:40:48,057
The best place to start is Porte de Clichy.
Bryan, try not to make a mess.

515
00:41:51,692 --> 00:41:53,990
- Gregor Milocivic?
- Yes. Yes, I am Gregor.

516
00:41:54,195 --> 00:41:56,493
I'm Mr. Smith. Get in.

517
00:42:01,302 --> 00:42:02,599
Here is my résumé.

518
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:05,568
The employment agency said
we would be doing translations.

519
00:42:05,739 --> 00:42:08,674
Yes. Albanian to English.
You do speak Albanian?

520
00:42:08,842 --> 00:42:11,970
Albanian, Serbian, Croatian.
I was a teacher in primary school...

521
00:42:12,146 --> 00:42:14,910
...before the war began in Pristina...
- What's your rate?

522
00:42:15,082 --> 00:42:16,344
My rate?

523
00:42:16,517 --> 00:42:19,680
It is 25 per hour for the first three hours
and then it goes up...

524
00:42:19,853 --> 00:42:23,653
Okay. Now, here's for 10 hours.
Wait here.

525
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:28,284
Mr. Smith, I do not understand.
What is the job exactly?

526
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:30,794
Right now the job is to wait here.

527
00:42:38,839 --> 00:42:40,272
Good evening.

528
00:42:40,441 --> 00:42:44,468
- Hi. Looking for a date?
- I love your dress. Is that silk?

529
00:42:44,878 --> 00:42:46,869
I don't know.
You want to know the prices?

530
00:42:47,047 --> 00:42:48,947
Just the way it falls, it must be silk.

531
00:42:49,116 --> 00:42:52,449
How it compliments
the natural curves of your body.

532
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:54,679
The rate is 40 euros for the standard.

533
00:42:54,855 --> 00:42:56,652
Standard? Could you be more specific?

534
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:59,486
Back home, the standard covers
a range of possibilities.

535
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,026
Like kissing,
you know, closed lips, open lips.

536
00:43:02,196 --> 00:43:05,188
- If you're not buying, piss off.
- I didn't say I wasn't buying.

537
00:43:05,366 --> 00:43:07,493
I like to get comfortable
before I purchase.

538
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:09,533
Like this karaoke machine I bought.

539
00:43:09,703 --> 00:43:13,366
I must have read that manual
from cover to cover so many times.

540
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:16,998
I don't give a shit. You're gonna
get me in trouble if you don't buy.

541
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:19,372
- Trouble? Really? With who?
- Piss off.

542
00:43:19,546 --> 00:43:22,208
Okay, okay. Listen, I'm sorry.

543
00:43:22,383 --> 00:43:25,648
If I want a package deal,
do I get a discount?

544
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:29,519
- You cost me two now.
- My name's Bryan.

545
00:43:30,591 --> 00:43:33,424
- Oh, God. You better leave.
- I thought we were negotiating.

546
00:43:34,428 --> 00:43:36,157
Anton, I swear, it's not my fault.

547
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:39,163
- I told him...
- Why are you bothering the girl?

548
00:43:39,333 --> 00:43:41,665
- None of your business.
- She is my business.

549
00:43:41,835 --> 00:43:44,429
And if you're not spending money,
you're costing money.

550
00:43:44,605 --> 00:43:47,403
- I was negotiating.
- No negotiating. Price is the price.

551
00:43:47,574 --> 00:43:49,508
Now you owe me
for two that got away.

552
00:43:49,677 --> 00:43:51,872
I don't owe you nothing.

553
00:43:53,414 --> 00:43:56,577
- Fifty euros or I kick your ass.
- Sure, sure, okay.

554
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:58,513
Chill.

555
00:44:00,521 --> 00:44:04,423
Okay. Here's your 50.

556
00:44:05,192 --> 00:44:09,219
And another 50 for being an asshole.
Now get the hell out of here.

557
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:12,092
If I see you again, I'll kill you.

558
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:21,872
Mr. Smith, I do not know what kind of
job I'm supposed to do for you, but...

559
00:44:22,042 --> 00:44:24,977
- You are to translate.
- Yes. But translate what?

560
00:44:25,145 --> 00:44:27,045
This.

561
00:44:34,288 --> 00:44:35,755
Translate.

562
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:39,391
- They're talking about you.
- What about me?

563
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:42,222
- They're not saying nice things.
- Be specific.

564
00:44:42,396 --> 00:44:45,854
They're saying... Excuse me, Mr. Smith.
- what an asshole you are.

565
00:44:47,468 --> 00:44:50,096
Please, if you can explain to me
why we're doing this...

566
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:51,931
Just translate.

567
00:44:52,139 --> 00:44:54,937
One of them says,
the sausage gave him heartburn.

568
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:56,303
Keep going.

569
00:44:56,477 --> 00:45:00,937
The other one is suggesting something
his grandmother used to give him.

570
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:04,573
- Do you really want to hear all this?
- Every word.

571
00:45:05,753 --> 00:45:09,780
Now they're talking about football.
The game between Lazio and Marseille.

572
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:11,857
And they lost money on the betting.

573
00:45:12,025 --> 00:45:16,587
- Perhaps if I knew the purpose...
- You're better off not knowing.

574
00:45:16,764 --> 00:45:19,028
Is it still football?

575
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:21,167
One is on the phone.

576
00:45:21,335 --> 00:45:23,633
He has to do a job
at the construction site.

577
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:26,830
Something about fresh merchandise
giving problems.

578
00:45:27,007 --> 00:45:29,373
Mr. Smith,
I do not understand any of this.

579
00:45:29,543 --> 00:45:32,478
You're not supposed to. Goodbye.

580
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:37,514
I asked for an English-Albanian
dictionary, did you bring one?

581
00:45:39,953 --> 00:45:40,977
Thank you.

582
00:47:19,152 --> 00:47:20,244
I love you.

583
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:38,029
Where did you get this?

584
00:47:38,238 --> 00:47:40,263
Where did you get this?

585
00:47:40,541 --> 00:47:43,442
- I'm good.
- Who gave this to you?

586
00:47:44,745 --> 00:47:47,839
- Who...? Who gave this to you?
- I'm good.

587
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:51,908
Hey.

588
00:48:15,876 --> 00:48:17,503
Hey.

589
00:48:32,025 --> 00:48:33,652
Come on.

590
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:16,076
Monsieur Allen, how are you?

591
00:52:16,249 --> 00:52:18,114
Hello, Gilles. How's the wife?

592
00:52:18,318 --> 00:52:19,842
Well, still in charge.

593
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:22,750
- Been a long time since I've seen you.
- Way too long.

594
00:52:23,356 --> 00:52:25,415
- The usual accommodation?
- Plus one.

595
00:54:12,198 --> 00:54:13,222
Yes?

596
00:54:13,433 --> 00:54:15,958
- <i>We need to talk.</i>
- I'm listening.

597
00:54:18,204 --> 00:54:20,138
Well, can't you come
and meet me first?

598
00:54:20,307 --> 00:54:21,934
I can't see you. Where are you?

599
00:54:22,208 --> 00:54:24,870
I can see you and hear you very well.

600
00:54:25,712 --> 00:54:28,078
You can tell them
to stop jogging now.

601
00:54:36,323 --> 00:54:38,518
Didn't think
I was gonna come down, did you?

602
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:40,990
I didn't think you were gonna
make such a mess.

603
00:54:41,161 --> 00:54:43,186
I didn't have time to worry
about neatness.

604
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:46,491
- <i>I know. You have 70 hours.</i>
- Now I have 56.

605
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:49,862
No, now you have none.

606
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:53,267
My chief wanted to arrest you,
I convinced him to send you home.

607
00:54:54,074 --> 00:54:58,909
<i>Air France 001 leaves today at 2.</i>
<i>First class.</i>

608
00:54:59,079 --> 00:55:02,071
Courtesy of the French government
for past services rendered.

609
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:08,843
- And what about my daughter?
- I told you, I sit behind a desk now.

610
00:55:09,022 --> 00:55:12,389
<i>I take my orders from someone</i>
<i>who sits behind a bigger desk.</i>

611
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:16,222
Come on, seven dead bodies,
three in hospital, a building destroyed.

612
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:17,727
<i>Total chaos at the airport.</i>

613
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:21,230
He wanted your ass in chains.
It's the best I could do, I'm sorry.

614
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:24,029
Sorry doesn't cut it, Jean-Claude.
Not this time.

615
00:55:27,707 --> 00:55:30,141
You can't beat the state, Bryan.
You know that.

616
00:55:30,310 --> 00:55:32,744
I'm not trying to.
I'm trying to save my daughter.

617
00:55:32,946 --> 00:55:34,607
It was a trailer, not a building.

618
00:56:14,981 --> 00:56:16,471
No, no, no. Leave it.

619
00:56:17,316 --> 00:56:19,079
It's all right, it's fluids.

620
00:56:19,285 --> 00:56:21,276
And medication
to counteract the drugs.

621
00:56:22,088 --> 00:56:23,350
It's all right.

622
00:56:26,459 --> 00:56:27,483
Where'd you get this?

623
00:56:28,294 --> 00:56:30,421
Where did you get this jacket?

624
00:56:31,664 --> 00:56:32,824
Did you get it from her?

625
00:56:33,466 --> 00:56:35,457
Was it from this girl?

626
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:39,431
I didn't steal it.

627
00:56:39,605 --> 00:56:43,268
- I was cold, she gave it to me.
- Where? Where did she give it to you?

628
00:56:44,944 --> 00:56:47,469
- In the house.
- What house?

629
00:56:48,614 --> 00:56:50,275
The house with the red door.

630
00:56:53,286 --> 00:56:54,617
Sorry.

631
00:56:59,659 --> 00:57:02,890
He said it was a party.

632
00:57:03,963 --> 00:57:06,363
The girl who gave you this,
was she in the house?

633
00:57:11,537 --> 00:57:13,164
She was nice.

634
00:57:13,339 --> 00:57:14,863
I know.

635
00:57:15,841 --> 00:57:17,331
She's my daughter.

636
00:57:22,481 --> 00:57:25,211
I need to find this house.
Do you know where it is?

637
00:57:31,991 --> 00:57:33,049
Paradise.

638
00:57:49,175 --> 00:57:50,836
- Good morning.
- May I help you?

639
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:53,137
- I'm here to see your boss.
- No boss.

640
00:57:58,684 --> 00:58:00,777
We're doing nothing wrong here.

641
00:58:02,188 --> 00:58:04,122
One button,
and 30 agents will be here...

642
00:58:04,290 --> 00:58:06,588
...before you have time
to scratch your balls.

643
00:58:06,759 --> 00:58:10,024
Stop jerking around before
I close you down for wasting my time.

644
00:58:15,768 --> 00:58:17,258
Wait here.

645
00:58:30,049 --> 00:58:31,073
You have weapon?

646
00:58:31,617 --> 00:58:32,675
You're holding it.

647
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:02,737
Black, one sugar, please.

648
00:59:09,955 --> 00:59:11,081
What is it you want?

649
00:59:12,625 --> 00:59:14,252
I'm here to negotiate the rates.

650
00:59:14,427 --> 00:59:17,658
We already negotiated the rate
with Mr. Macon.

651
00:59:17,830 --> 00:59:20,993
Mr. Macon has moved
to another division.

652
00:59:21,167 --> 00:59:22,998
I'm here for the renegotiation.

653
00:59:26,839 --> 00:59:30,434
Unless you think I'm being unreasonable,
let me explain ourselves.

654
00:59:31,277 --> 00:59:35,509
Nice coffee. We have you under
satellite surveillance, 24 hours a day.

655
00:59:35,681 --> 00:59:39,310
We hear everything you say,
we know everything you do.

656
00:59:39,485 --> 00:59:42,818
Do you have any idea what it costs
just to change the angle...

657
00:59:42,988 --> 00:59:46,480
...of the lens on a satellite
orbiting 200 miles above the Earth?

658
00:59:46,826 --> 00:59:48,225
And those costs have gone up.

659
00:59:48,394 --> 00:59:51,625
Our costs go up, your costs go up.
It's only logical.

660
00:59:52,531 --> 00:59:54,897
By the way,
which one of you is Marko?

661
00:59:55,067 --> 00:59:56,864
Why do you want to know?

662
00:59:57,036 --> 00:59:58,560
I was told Marko is in charge.

663
00:59:58,771 --> 01:00:00,500
We are all Marko.

664
01:00:01,507 --> 01:00:03,134
Marko from Tropoja.

665
01:00:03,309 --> 01:00:04,571
We are all from Tropoja.

666
01:00:07,346 --> 01:00:10,679
If that's the game you want to play,
the rate just went up 10 percent.

667
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:15,082
If you are trying to extort us because
we are immigrants, we know the law.

668
01:00:15,488 --> 01:00:17,979
I'm extorting you because
you are breaking the law.

669
01:00:18,157 --> 01:00:20,648
Which charge would you
like to be arrested for?

670
01:00:20,826 --> 01:00:23,818
Drugs, kidnapping, prostitution?
Take your pick.

671
01:00:24,029 --> 01:00:26,589
You come to this country,
take advantage of it...

672
01:00:26,799 --> 01:00:29,859
...and think because we are tolerant,
we are weak and helpless.

673
01:00:30,236 --> 01:00:31,897
Your arrogance offends me.

674
01:00:32,071 --> 01:00:34,039
For that,
the rate went up 10 percent.

675
01:00:35,241 --> 01:00:38,335
Now, do you want to get down
to business or to keep playing?

676
01:00:40,312 --> 01:00:42,109
- How much?
- Twenty percent.

677
01:00:42,314 --> 01:00:45,078
And you have my word it'll not go up
for a year.

678
01:00:54,059 --> 01:00:57,187
How do you say "sugar"
in your language?

679
01:01:10,543 --> 01:01:12,773
You've made a very good investment,
gentlemen.

680
01:01:12,978 --> 01:01:14,070
See you in a month.

681
01:01:19,051 --> 01:01:22,214
A friend gave this to me.
It's Albanian. You mind translating it?

682
01:01:34,567 --> 01:01:36,228
Good luck.

683
01:01:36,669 --> 01:01:37,795
- Good luck.
- <i>Good luck.</i>

684
01:01:38,571 --> 01:01:40,368
- <i>Good luck. Good luck.</i>
- Good luck.

685
01:01:50,249 --> 01:01:51,944
You don't remember me.

686
01:01:52,751 --> 01:01:54,742
We spoke on the phone
two days ago.

687
01:01:58,290 --> 01:01:59,757
I told you I would find you.

688
01:03:04,757 --> 01:03:05,815
Kim.

689
01:03:20,172 --> 01:03:21,764
Amanda.

690
01:03:57,710 --> 01:03:58,768
Wake up!

691
01:03:59,311 --> 01:04:01,040
I need you to be focused.

692
01:04:04,216 --> 01:04:06,081
Are you focused yet?

693
01:04:15,928 --> 01:04:17,088
Where is this girl?

694
01:04:17,730 --> 01:04:19,459
Where is she?

695
01:04:47,993 --> 01:04:51,827
You know, we used to outsource
this kind of thing.

696
01:04:51,997 --> 01:04:54,625
But what we found was the countries
we outsourced to...

697
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:58,201
...had unreliable power grids.
Very Third World.

698
01:04:58,370 --> 01:05:00,702
You'd turn on a switch,
power wouldn't come on...

699
01:05:00,873 --> 01:05:04,866
...and then tempers would get short.
People would resort to pulling fingernails.

700
01:05:05,077 --> 01:05:07,375
Acid drips on bare skin.

701
01:05:07,579 --> 01:05:09,979
The whole exercise
would become counterproductive.

702
01:05:10,149 --> 01:05:11,810
But here, the power's stable.

703
01:05:11,984 --> 01:05:14,316
Here, there's a nice even flow.

704
01:05:14,486 --> 01:05:17,785
Here, you can flip a switch
and the power stays on all day.

705
01:05:21,894 --> 01:05:23,225
Where is she?

706
01:05:44,149 --> 01:05:48,108
Now, I don't have any more time
to waste, Marko from Tropoja.

707
01:05:48,554 --> 01:05:50,852
Give me what I need
or this switch'll stay on...

708
01:05:51,023 --> 01:05:54,015
...till they turn power off
for lack of payment on the bill.

709
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:56,522
Where is my daughter?

710
01:05:57,062 --> 01:06:00,520
We don't keep virgins, we sell them.

711
01:06:00,732 --> 01:06:02,893
She was virgin, lot of money.

712
01:06:03,068 --> 01:06:05,229
You sold my daughter? You sold her?

713
01:06:07,239 --> 01:06:08,866
To who?

714
01:06:09,575 --> 01:06:11,202
I don't know.

715
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:15,544
- What?
- Saint-Clair.

716
01:06:16,048 --> 01:06:17,072
Saint-Clair.

717
01:06:17,516 --> 01:06:20,076
Saint-Clair? Saint-Clair.
Is that a person, a place?

718
01:06:21,687 --> 01:06:24,713
Person. Patrice Saint-Clair.

719
01:06:24,890 --> 01:06:25,914
Patrice Saint-Clair.

720
01:06:27,092 --> 01:06:28,423
Where can I find him?

721
01:06:29,394 --> 01:06:31,225
I don't know, I don't know.

722
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:34,726
I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know.

723
01:06:34,933 --> 01:06:37,197
Please! I don't know!

724
01:06:37,369 --> 01:06:41,362
I don't know! No! Please! Please.

725
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:43,371
Please.

726
01:06:43,542 --> 01:06:45,635
Not that. Please.

727
01:06:45,811 --> 01:06:47,210
I believe you.

728
01:06:50,048 --> 01:06:52,312
But it's not gonna save you.

729
01:07:15,474 --> 01:07:17,339
Look who dropped by.

730
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:20,737
Bryan, what a pleasant surprise.

731
01:07:20,946 --> 01:07:21,970
Jean-Claude.

732
01:07:22,147 --> 01:07:24,615
The children waited up for you.

733
01:07:24,783 --> 01:07:28,116
If you tuck them in, maybe we can eat
before everything gets cold.

734
01:07:28,287 --> 01:07:29,811
Bryan, will you do the honors?

735
01:07:30,022 --> 01:07:31,922
- Sure.
- I'll be just a minute.

736
01:08:02,454 --> 01:08:04,615
I was just telling Bryan
how nice it's been...

737
01:08:04,790 --> 01:08:06,951
...since you left the old job
for the new one.

738
01:08:07,125 --> 01:08:09,958
Home every night for dinner,
get to see the kids more.

739
01:08:10,128 --> 01:08:13,188
Yeah, must be nice coming home
every night, seeing your kids.

740
01:08:13,398 --> 01:08:15,491
Bryan has been thinking
about relocating.

741
01:08:15,901 --> 01:08:17,368
- Really?
- Yes.

742
01:08:17,536 --> 01:08:19,333
To Paris, he's been visiting houses.

743
01:08:19,504 --> 01:08:22,166
- White or dark meat?
- Dark, please.

744
01:08:22,341 --> 01:08:23,672
Find anything interesting?

745
01:08:23,842 --> 01:08:27,642
As a matter of fact, I did, in the 10th
arrondissement on Rue Paradis.

746
01:08:28,547 --> 01:08:31,038
People there know someone
that works in your office.

747
01:08:31,283 --> 01:08:33,251
A Mr. Macon. Do you know him?

748
01:08:33,418 --> 01:08:35,682
Oh, Henry. I call him Mr. Nervous.

749
01:08:35,854 --> 01:08:39,551
Always seems like he's about to
have a problem. Carrots?

750
01:08:39,725 --> 01:08:41,556
I got to the bottom of it,
Jean-Claude.

751
01:08:41,893 --> 01:08:43,053
I know everything.

752
01:08:43,795 --> 01:08:46,059
I hope you're not involved in this shit.

753
01:08:47,399 --> 01:08:50,266
- What shit?
- This is not the time or place, Bryan.

754
01:08:50,435 --> 01:08:52,528
- Are you involved?
- Involved in what?

755
01:08:53,171 --> 01:08:54,661
What are you two talking about?

756
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:58,435
- Are you?
- My salary is X, my expenses are Y.

757
01:08:58,610 --> 01:09:00,669
As long as my family is provided for...

758
01:09:00,846 --> 01:09:03,440
...I do not care
where the difference comes from.

759
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:05,515
That is my entire involvement.

760
01:09:05,684 --> 01:09:07,675
- What about my family?
- I told you...

761
01:09:07,853 --> 01:09:10,287
...I would help
as long as it didn't cause trouble.

762
01:09:10,455 --> 01:09:11,786
Who is Patrice Saint-Clair?

763
01:09:11,957 --> 01:09:15,449
I don't know, I don't care.
I am driving you to the airport.

764
01:09:15,694 --> 01:09:16,922
Jean-Claude.

765
01:09:18,397 --> 01:09:20,058
Let's get going. Dinner is over.

766
01:09:20,232 --> 01:09:22,029
- I'm not finished yet.
- Yes, you are.

767
01:09:22,267 --> 01:09:25,134
- No!
- No, I'm not.

768
01:09:29,875 --> 01:09:33,106
That's what happens when you sit
behind a desk. You forget things.

769
01:09:33,278 --> 01:09:35,746
Like the weight in the hand
of a gun that's loaded.

770
01:09:37,849 --> 01:09:38,975
Isabelle!

771
01:09:40,419 --> 01:09:41,579
It's a flesh wound.

772
01:09:41,753 --> 01:09:45,450
But if you don't get me what I need,
the last thing you'll see...

773
01:09:45,624 --> 01:09:47,615
...is the bullet
I put between her eyes.

774
01:09:47,793 --> 01:09:50,853
Now, Patrice Saint-Clair.

775
01:10:02,474 --> 01:10:04,271
You could've made this
less painful...

776
01:10:04,443 --> 01:10:08,573
...if you had been more concerned about
my daughter and less about your desk.

777
01:10:08,747 --> 01:10:11,079
Please apologize to your wife for me.

778
01:11:16,348 --> 01:11:19,215
- Can I help you?
- Yes, I'm here to see Mr. Saint-Clair.

779
01:11:19,384 --> 01:11:20,942
Your name, please.

780
01:11:24,956 --> 01:11:26,856
I'm sorry,
your name is not on the list.

781
01:11:27,025 --> 01:11:28,583
Oh, please check again.

782
01:11:31,663 --> 01:11:33,358
Inside.

783
01:12:21,012 --> 01:12:22,240
May I help you, sir?

784
01:12:27,886 --> 01:12:30,377
- Your champagne.
- Yeah, I will take it.

785
01:12:40,165 --> 01:12:43,430
<i>I have 50,000. Fifty thousand.</i>

786
01:12:45,237 --> 01:12:47,262
<i>Fifty thousand.</i>

787
01:12:48,807 --> 01:12:52,072
<i>One hundred, 100,000.</i>

788
01:12:53,912 --> 01:12:57,075
<i>One hundred, 150.</i>

789
01:12:58,183 --> 01:12:59,343
<i>I have 150.</i>

790
01:12:59,985 --> 01:13:02,146
Your champagne, sir.

791
01:13:02,921 --> 01:13:05,617
<i>Two, I have two, 250.</i>

792
01:13:05,790 --> 01:13:06,814
May I serve?

793
01:13:06,992 --> 01:13:08,357
- Please.
- <i>I have 250.</i>

794
01:13:10,195 --> 01:13:11,924
<i>Two-fifty.</i>

795
01:13:12,497 --> 01:13:15,557
<i>Sold for 250,000.</i>

796
01:13:33,618 --> 01:13:35,779
<i>The last item.</i>

797
01:13:36,121 --> 01:13:38,612
<i>As usual, we save the best for last.</i>

798
01:13:38,957 --> 01:13:41,118
<i>Speaks English, some French.</i>

799
01:13:41,293 --> 01:13:42,726
<i>Certified pure.</i>

800
01:13:52,671 --> 01:13:53,695
- Sorry.
- Get out.

801
01:13:55,307 --> 01:13:58,037
<i>The bidding will begin at 100,000.</i>

802
01:14:01,513 --> 01:14:03,640
<i>One hundred.</i>

803
01:14:13,558 --> 01:14:15,355
<i>One hundred thousand.</i>

804
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:17,721
- I said...
- I heard what you said.

805
01:14:17,896 --> 01:14:19,227
Buy her.

806
01:14:19,431 --> 01:14:20,523
<i>I have 100.</i>

807
01:14:22,267 --> 01:14:25,031
- Buy her.
- <i>One-fifty.</i>

808
01:14:25,236 --> 01:14:26,760
<i>Two hundred.</i>

809
01:14:27,505 --> 01:14:30,167
<i>Two-fifty, three, 350.</i>

810
01:14:30,375 --> 01:14:33,640
<i>Three hundred and fifty thousand.</i>

811
01:14:34,245 --> 01:14:36,440
<i>Four. Four.</i>

812
01:14:36,948 --> 01:14:39,416
<i>Four-fifty, 450.</i>

813
01:14:39,651 --> 01:14:41,516
<i>Four hundred and fifty thousand.</i>

814
01:14:42,220 --> 01:14:43,278
<i>Four-fifty.</i>

815
01:14:44,456 --> 01:14:46,424
<i>Five hundred. Five hundred thousand.</i>

816
01:14:46,591 --> 01:14:50,584
<i>Five hundred thousand. Sold.</i>

817
01:14:51,062 --> 01:14:54,759
<i>That concludes the sales for tonight.</i>
<i>Thank you all for coming.</i>

818
01:14:55,233 --> 01:14:58,202
- <i>You can collect your purchases directly.</i>
- Move.

819
01:14:58,370 --> 01:15:02,397
- You will never get away with this.
- If you wanna live, you'll make sure I do.

820
01:15:12,217 --> 01:15:14,685
Now, Mr?

821
01:15:20,892 --> 01:15:24,328
Well, we know you're not this man.
So, what do we call you?

822
01:15:27,632 --> 01:15:29,566
It doesn't matter what we call you...

823
01:15:29,734 --> 01:15:32,202
...what does matter
is what you're doing here.

824
01:15:33,571 --> 01:15:35,505
The last girl, I'm her father.

825
01:15:38,076 --> 01:15:41,204
- Oh, my.
- Give her to me.

826
01:15:42,514 --> 01:15:44,778
I wish I could, honestly.

827
01:15:44,949 --> 01:15:46,644
See, I'm a father myself.

828
01:15:46,818 --> 01:15:48,843
I have two sons and a daughter...

829
01:15:49,020 --> 01:15:52,012
...but let me tell you something,
Mr. Whoever-You-Are.

830
01:15:52,223 --> 01:15:53,520
This is a business.

831
01:15:53,725 --> 01:15:55,454
This is a very unique business...

832
01:15:55,627 --> 01:15:58,357
...with a very unique clientele.
- I'll pay.

833
01:15:58,596 --> 01:16:01,030
In this business,
you have no refunds, returns...

834
01:16:01,232 --> 01:16:03,291
...discounts, buybacks.
All sales are final.

835
01:16:03,468 --> 01:16:08,337
Besides discretion,
it's about the only rule we have.

836
01:16:10,275 --> 01:16:12,766
Kill him. Quietly. I have guests.

837
01:17:11,002 --> 01:17:13,368
Would you please go see
which part of "quietly"...

838
01:17:13,538 --> 01:17:16,200
...they did not understand?
- Yes, sir.

839
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:39,191
Okay, we can resolve this.
I know how you feel.

840
01:17:39,364 --> 01:17:42,026
We should talk, okay?
We can work this out.

841
01:17:44,335 --> 01:17:46,030
You have no idea...

842
01:17:47,138 --> 01:17:48,366
- Where is she?
- Please.

843
01:17:48,573 --> 01:17:49,835
Understand. Please try...

844
01:17:54,546 --> 01:17:57,606
There's a boat by the quay.

845
01:17:58,850 --> 01:18:00,317
Please understand.

846
01:18:00,485 --> 01:18:04,854
It was all business,
it wasn't personal.

847
01:18:05,056 --> 01:18:06,785
It was all personal to me.

848
01:25:03,841 --> 01:25:04,899
We can...

849
01:25:16,887 --> 01:25:20,584
- Daddy.
- Kim.

850
01:25:21,359 --> 01:25:23,486
You came for me.

851
01:25:28,065 --> 01:25:29,532
You came for me.

852
01:25:32,303 --> 01:25:34,362
I told you I would.

853
01:26:03,334 --> 01:26:06,462
<i>May I have your attention.</i>
<i>If you're waiting for oversized bags...</i>

854
01:26:07,972 --> 01:26:09,872
Mom.

855
01:26:11,609 --> 01:26:13,577
Oh, my God.

856
01:26:13,978 --> 01:26:16,242
Oh, sweetie.

857
01:26:16,914 --> 01:26:19,246
Oh, here, let me get that for you.

858
01:26:19,417 --> 01:26:21,351
Bryan, if there's anything you need...

859
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:24,881
I've got everything I need.

860
01:26:25,056 --> 01:26:27,650
I love you so much.

861
01:26:29,794 --> 01:26:31,887
Stuart.

862
01:26:32,797 --> 01:26:34,788
Thank you.

863
01:26:42,073 --> 01:26:45,008
<i>Attention, travelers.</i>
<i>You are not required</i> to...

864
01:26:45,176 --> 01:26:47,110
Shall we go?

865
01:26:52,149 --> 01:26:54,617
Sure you don't wanna ride with us?

866
01:26:55,252 --> 01:26:59,882
- I'll be fine. I'll take a cab. Thanks.
- All right.

867
01:27:08,199 --> 01:27:10,394
- I love you, Dad.
- Love you too.

868
01:27:33,524 --> 01:27:36,493
- Where are we?
- I told you. It's a surprise.

869
01:27:38,462 --> 01:27:40,430
- Hi.
- Hi.

870
01:27:43,367 --> 01:27:46,825
When someone says "hi,"
it's usually polite to say "hi" back.

871
01:27:47,571 --> 01:27:48,663
Hi.

872
01:27:48,839 --> 01:27:50,007
I heard you
wanna be a singer.

873
01:27:50,474 --> 01:27:52,237
- I do.
- She does.

874
01:27:53,844 --> 01:27:57,211
Well, come on in.
Let's see what you got.

875
01:33:20,103 --> 01:33:22,095
