1
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:35,537
All clear.

2
00:02:15,985 --> 00:02:17,748
Shh.

3
00:02:17,921 --> 00:02:19,320
Ali.

4
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:41,007
<i>Do we belong there?
Do we not?</i>

5
00:03:41,437 --> 00:03:43,530
<i>It doesn't matter</i>
<i>how you would answer that...</i>

6
00:03:43,706 --> 00:03:48,040
<i>... because we are there.</i>
<i>We're tired, and we can't see the end.</i>

7
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:52,877
<i>We can't even console ourselves</i>
<i>that our enemy is just as tired as we are.</i>

8
00:03:53,683 --> 00:03:55,173
<i>Because they're not.</i>

9
00:03:58,187 --> 00:04:04,092
<i>It is a fallacy that prolonged war</i>
<i>will weaken an occupied enemy.</i>

10
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,284
He's dead.

11
00:04:05,461 --> 00:04:08,794
<i>It most likely</i>
<i>will make your enemy stronger.</i>

12
00:04:08,965 --> 00:04:12,526
<i>They get used to the deprivation,</i>
<i>and they adapt and respond accordingly.</i>

13
00:04:14,237 --> 00:04:15,932
While here at home...

14
00:04:16,105 --> 00:04:20,508
<i>The explosion occurred in one of</i>
<i>Manchester's heavily Asian neighborhoods.</i>

15
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,269
...with every death reported...

16
00:04:22,445 --> 00:04:26,745
...we have to deal with a public-opinion
trajectory that slides rapidly...

17
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:30,750
...from supportive to negative
to downright hostile.

18
00:04:31,387 --> 00:04:35,448
People just get sick and tired
of a moment's silence at a ball game.

19
00:04:36,225 --> 00:04:38,284
They just wanna be told that it's over.

20
00:04:38,461 --> 00:04:40,929
<i>Police and emergency</i>
<i>workers in Manchester...</i>

21
00:04:41,097 --> 00:04:43,964
<i>... are still combing through what is left</i>
<i>of this block of flats.</i>

22
00:04:44,133 --> 00:04:45,725
<i>They say this was not the target.</i>

23
00:04:45,902 --> 00:04:49,531
<i>Had the bombs being constructed here</i>
<i>found their eventual intended target...</i>

24
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:50,900
<i>... the devastation could...</i>

25
00:04:51,074 --> 00:04:52,735
Despite the fact...

26
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:55,935
...we have markedly increased
our operational intensity...

27
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,613
...we're not seeing any progress.

28
00:04:59,682 --> 00:05:01,616
What we're dealing with here...

29
00:05:01,784 --> 00:05:05,015
...is potentially a global conflagration...

30
00:05:05,188 --> 00:05:08,988
...that requires constant diligence
in order to suppress.

31
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,451
Now, you see...

32
00:05:12,996 --> 00:05:16,022
...because our enemy...

33
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:21,193
...has realized that they are fighting guys
from the future.

34
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:26,735
Now, ahem, it is brilliant
as it is infuriating.

35
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:31,369
If you live like it's the past,
and you behave like it's the past...

36
00:05:31,547 --> 00:05:34,880
...then guys from the future
find it very hard to see you.

37
00:05:35,051 --> 00:05:38,578
If you throw away your cell phone,
shut down your e-mail...

38
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:42,816
<i>... pass all your instructions face-to-face,</i>
<i>hand-to-hand...</i>

39
00:05:42,992 --> 00:05:46,257
<i>... turn your back on technology</i>
<i>and just disappear into the crowd...</i>

40
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:49,262
<i>No flags. No uniforms.</i>

41
00:05:50,366 --> 00:05:52,561
<i>You got your basic grunts</i>
<i>on the ground there.</i>

42
00:05:52,735 --> 00:05:55,067
<i>They're looking going,</i>
<i>"Who is it we're fighting?"</i>

43
00:05:55,238 --> 00:05:59,868
<i>In a situation like this,</i>
<i>your friends dress just like your enemies...</i>

44
00:06:00,043 --> 00:06:02,534
<i>... and your enemies dress</i>
<i>like your friends.</i>

45
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:07,913
What I need you to fully understand is that
these people, they do not wanna negotiate.

46
00:06:08,084 --> 00:06:09,574
Not at all.

47
00:06:09,752 --> 00:06:13,984
<i>They want the universal caliphate</i>
<i>established across the face of the Earth...</i>

48
00:06:15,324 --> 00:06:19,727
<i>... and they want every infidel converted</i>
<i>or dead.</i>

49
00:06:22,565 --> 00:06:24,760
So, what's changed...

50
00:06:25,101 --> 00:06:28,537
...is that our
allegedly unsophisticated enemy...

51
00:06:28,704 --> 00:06:32,037
...has cottoned on
to the factually unsophisticated truth...

52
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,539
...we're an easy target.

53
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:36,439
<i>We are an easy target...</i>

54
00:06:36,612 --> 00:06:40,139
<i>... and our world as we know it</i>
<i>is a lot simpler...</i>

55
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:43,410
...to put to an end than you might think.

56
00:06:44,253 --> 00:06:47,654
We take our foot off the throat
of this enemy for one minute...

57
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:50,088
...and our world changes completely.

58
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:52,124
Thank you, Mr. Hoffman.

59
00:07:04,373 --> 00:07:05,635
BASSAM

60
00:07:06,242 --> 00:07:07,903
I'm coming.

61
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,144
You're early.

62
00:07:17,153 --> 00:07:18,620
Big boss man, what's happening?

63
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,085
What's the story?

64
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:24,556
Rules of the day.

65
00:07:24,727 --> 00:07:26,991
If the car gets immobilized,
start shooting.

66
00:07:27,163 --> 00:07:29,324
Nobody gets traded. Everybody dies.

67
00:07:29,499 --> 00:07:31,262
So same as every day?

68
00:07:31,434 --> 00:07:34,267
- You got it. Want some breakfast?
- Hell, yes.

69
00:07:35,271 --> 00:07:36,295
Thanks.

70
00:07:37,673 --> 00:07:39,038
All right. Tell me something real.

71
00:07:39,675 --> 00:07:41,905
<i>Oh, all I got is real, man. You know me.</i>

72
00:07:42,078 --> 00:07:43,306
All right, let's hear it.

73
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:47,074
All right, a guy named Nizar.

74
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,445
He's from Aquiz up near Tikrit, right?

75
00:07:49,619 --> 00:07:53,077
So he gets all fucked in his head
after the invasion, you know?

76
00:07:53,256 --> 00:07:55,884
He starts working with the Baathists,
then the jihadists.

77
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:59,186
But he is scared shitless now, man.

78
00:07:59,362 --> 00:08:01,762
He's supposed
to do a martyrdom operation...

79
00:08:01,931 --> 00:08:03,990
...but he doesn't wanna fucking die.

80
00:08:04,167 --> 00:08:06,294
So he's coming to us.

81
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:07,834
- He's coming to us?
- Mm-hm.

82
00:08:09,338 --> 00:08:10,965
For chrissakes, move the donkey.

83
00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:15,842
Move it, let's go.
Get these guys moving. Let's go.

84
00:08:16,012 --> 00:08:18,344
Come on, come on.

85
00:08:18,514 --> 00:08:21,244
Oh, my God. Just get the...
Buy the fucking flowers.

86
00:08:23,719 --> 00:08:25,619
Come on, come on.

87
00:08:25,788 --> 00:08:28,552
So, what are the chances
your man's playing both sides?

88
00:08:28,724 --> 00:08:30,851
I don't know. What are they with me?

89
00:08:31,027 --> 00:08:32,995
Three to one.

90
00:08:33,162 --> 00:08:34,527
All right. Let's slow down.

91
00:08:34,697 --> 00:08:36,164
Is this it?

92
00:08:36,332 --> 00:08:39,460
Yeah. This is it.

93
00:08:39,635 --> 00:08:42,695
Nitrate 37 slewing to target ports now.

94
00:08:42,872 --> 00:08:44,396
01 L2MDT.

95
00:08:44,574 --> 00:08:46,701
On target, 15:31 Zulu.

96
00:08:46,876 --> 00:08:48,810
Cell phone linked to moving vehicle.

97
00:08:48,978 --> 00:08:50,639
<i>Stop right up here.</i>

98
00:08:50,813 --> 00:08:54,112
Right up here. Let me take a look.

99
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,948
- I don't see anything.
- I'm gonna call him.

100
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:01,987
All right, call him.

101
00:09:06,596 --> 00:09:07,620
<i>Bassam.</i>

102
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,424
Yeah, Nizar.

103
00:09:12,935 --> 00:09:13,959
NIZAR:

104
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,296
Huh?

105
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,166
NIZAR:

106
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,500
IR 3.9.

107
00:09:18,674 --> 00:09:22,201
- He says he wants one of us to come in.
- He is to meet inside the car.

108
00:09:22,378 --> 00:09:24,869
Inside the car.
If he wants to talk, it's in the car.

109
00:09:25,047 --> 00:09:27,743
You have to come to us, Nizar.

110
00:09:27,917 --> 00:09:30,511
- I'm coming to you.
- Do the fuck what I said. Go.

111
00:09:31,621 --> 00:09:33,452
Hey, hey. Listen to me.

112
00:09:33,623 --> 00:09:35,887
I am not getting my head cut off
on the Internet.

113
00:09:36,058 --> 00:09:37,525
If something happens, shoot me.

114
00:09:37,693 --> 00:09:40,856
- Will you shoot me?
- Fuck that shit. I will shoot you right now.

115
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:43,225
- I'm not kidding.
- Quit being a pussy.

116
00:09:47,403 --> 00:09:48,597
Nizar.

117
00:09:50,906 --> 00:09:52,498
Zooming in.

118
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,233
Visual confirmed.

119
00:09:54,944 --> 00:09:56,844
Long wave 10.7.

120
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,382
Shit.

121
00:10:07,556 --> 00:10:10,525
- I can't talk right now, Larry.
- She wants the house.

122
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:13,287
<i>Give her the house.</i>
<i>It's a piece of shit, all right?</i>

123
00:10:13,462 --> 00:10:15,623
- We're getting this, sir.
- We're getting it.

124
00:10:15,798 --> 00:10:18,596
She can ask for whatever she wants,
but I'm not listening.

125
00:10:18,768 --> 00:10:21,259
<i>What the hell are you calling for?</i>
<i>Hang up the phone.</i>

126
00:10:21,437 --> 00:10:22,904
Hang up the phone.

127
00:10:24,974 --> 00:10:26,464
Are you on the line?

128
00:10:26,642 --> 00:10:29,338
I can see you now, all right?
You are attracting attention.

129
00:10:29,512 --> 00:10:32,879
Get the fuck out of here right now.
I will handle this on my own.

130
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,277
Roger that. Off target.

131
00:10:35,117 --> 00:10:37,677
Copy. Off target, 3-10.

132
00:10:42,525 --> 00:10:43,719
FERRIS

133
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:45,519
Yes.

134
00:10:45,695 --> 00:10:47,094
Good, good, good.

135
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:53,465
You want an orange? You hungry?

136
00:10:53,636 --> 00:10:54,762
No.

137
00:10:58,341 --> 00:11:00,775
So, Nizar...

138
00:11:00,943 --> 00:11:02,740
...why'd you come to me, huh?

139
00:11:03,312 --> 00:11:05,280
I know too many things.

140
00:11:06,782 --> 00:11:09,376
They prepared me to go outside Iraq.

141
00:11:10,686 --> 00:11:13,416
What do you mean by "outside Iraq"?

142
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:16,956
They said they need me
to become shahid...

143
00:11:17,126 --> 00:11:19,151
...for martyrdom.

144
00:11:19,328 --> 00:11:22,786
When a man knows too much,
they say martyrdom.

145
00:11:22,965 --> 00:11:26,765
Who do you mean by "they," Nizar? Hm?

146
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:34,736
I don't want to die.

147
00:11:36,912 --> 00:11:39,142
I want to go to America.

148
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,144
I have a Ph.D., you know?

149
00:11:42,318 --> 00:11:45,185
And they want me...
They want me to blow myself up.

150
00:11:45,688 --> 00:11:48,486
- Ph.D. in what, chemistry?
- No.

151
00:11:48,657 --> 00:11:50,818
What do you know
about radiological materials?

152
00:11:50,993 --> 00:11:54,087
Linguistic. I speak five languages.
Five, you know?

153
00:11:54,263 --> 00:11:56,390
Nobody should say "martyr" to me.
Nobody.

154
00:11:56,565 --> 00:11:59,159
- You are a rare and a delicate flower.
- Yes, I am.

155
00:11:59,335 --> 00:12:00,359
- Yes.
- Yes.

156
00:12:00,536 --> 00:12:03,369
So you don't wanna kill the Jews
and the Crusaders, huh?

157
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,737
What do you know about our pain?

158
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,368
Cut the bullshit, all right?

159
00:12:09,545 --> 00:12:11,638
Give me some information.
What do you know?

160
00:12:17,253 --> 00:12:20,381
You know,
I know enough to be martyred.

161
00:12:20,556 --> 00:12:23,855
But with you,
I know enough to stay alive.

162
00:12:29,698 --> 00:12:31,723
You have a computer?

163
00:12:49,418 --> 00:12:51,443
- Yup.
<i>- Hey, Ed, it's me.</i>

164
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,418
I got an Iraqi walk-in, up near Samarra.

165
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:58,287
He's got a communiqué video here that
somebody walked across the Iranian border.

166
00:12:58,461 --> 00:13:00,292
I'm watching it right now, sir.

167
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:03,023
- Can you see his face?
- <i>Yes, captain.</i>

168
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,133
<i>I am looking at the white whale.</i>

169
00:13:05,601 --> 00:13:07,933
- It is Al-Saleem.
- <i>What's he saying?</i>

170
00:13:08,103 --> 00:13:09,365
<i>Well, it's gotta be current.</i>

171
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:11,802
He mentions the Sheffield bus bombings
a week ago.

172
00:13:11,974 --> 00:13:15,671
He's telling the brothers to prepare for
a UK operation's already planned...

173
00:13:15,845 --> 00:13:19,372
...which is the bombing these people
fucked up in Manchester this morning.

174
00:13:19,815 --> 00:13:22,443
<i>Let me translate this part</i>
<i>for you directly.</i>

175
00:13:25,488 --> 00:13:29,515
"We will avenge the America wars
on the Muslim world.

176
00:13:31,327 --> 00:13:33,659
We will come at them everywhere.

177
00:13:34,296 --> 00:13:39,233
<i>We will strike at random, across Europe,</i>
<i>then America, continually.</i>

178
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,266
We have bled.

179
00:13:41,437 --> 00:13:45,237
Now they will bleed. And bleed.

180
00:13:45,841 --> 00:13:47,741
Until they are bled out."

181
00:13:50,012 --> 00:13:51,479
Ed.

182
00:13:51,647 --> 00:13:54,241
It's 6:00 in the morning.

183
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,145
Saving civilization, honey.

184
00:13:56,318 --> 00:13:58,115
<i>Disks are passed from hand to hand.</i>

185
00:13:58,287 --> 00:14:00,847
The communiqués are not transmitted,
not copied.

186
00:14:01,023 --> 00:14:04,481
My man says that real orders
are verbal or in code on paper.

187
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,787
Is there any indication of where he is?

188
00:14:06,962 --> 00:14:10,420
No, sir.
He definitely does not have his location.

189
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,960
But he did mention there's a safe house
up north, near Balad...

190
00:14:14,136 --> 00:14:15,728
<i>... where Al-Saleem may have been.</i>

191
00:14:15,905 --> 00:14:17,532
Dad?

192
00:14:17,706 --> 00:14:19,037
Hey.

193
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:22,177
They're killing anyone who knows anything.
He's scared.

194
00:14:22,344 --> 00:14:24,812
<i>We need to debrief him very carefully.</i>

195
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,448
- All right, so do it.
- <i>In the States.</i>

196
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:28,947
No. Ahem.

197
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,643
They're onto him.
That's the reason he's running.

198
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,152
- On the toilet, not the floor.
- <i>You hear me, right?</i>

199
00:14:34,323 --> 00:14:36,814
So he wants to come to America
in one piece...

200
00:14:36,992 --> 00:14:39,187
...instead of going to paradise
in a thousand.

201
00:14:39,361 --> 00:14:41,158
He should've thought of that before.

202
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:44,857
I'm telling you.
They will kill him within a few days, Ed.

203
00:14:45,034 --> 00:14:47,594
Yep. And if they do, that's all right...

204
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:50,330
...because we can be there
to see who pulls the trigger.

205
00:14:50,506 --> 00:14:52,804
Now, get back to bed. Good night.

206
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:56,638
- Am I missing the point?
- I just offered him asylum.

207
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:58,473
<i>Well, you lied, buddy.</i>

208
00:14:59,281 --> 00:15:02,512
So just cut him loose...

209
00:15:02,685 --> 00:15:04,983
<i>... and put him back on the street.</i>

210
00:15:05,688 --> 00:15:06,712
All right.

211
00:15:15,064 --> 00:15:17,897
Okay, so everything's fine.
No, no, no problem. No problem.

212
00:15:18,067 --> 00:15:22,163
We just have to ask you a few more
questions, and then we can go.

213
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,602
No, no more questions.
Take me to the Green Zone.

214
00:15:24,773 --> 00:15:28,106
Maybe we could help. We have
a few questions. Everything will be fine.

215
00:15:28,277 --> 00:15:31,303
Trust me. Okay? It's okay. Sit down.

216
00:15:33,248 --> 00:15:35,739
You're a liar. You're a liar. You fucking d...

217
00:15:35,918 --> 00:15:38,580
Get on the fucking... Back the fuck up!
Step back!

218
00:15:38,754 --> 00:15:41,689
I talk to you! I talk to you!
And that's all you want!

219
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:45,349
- You want to see who kills me, huh?
- Bassam. Search him. Get his phone.

220
00:15:46,795 --> 00:15:49,525
Now you've seen our faces.
You know what that means.

221
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:50,722
Computer.

222
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:53,333
Guantanamo?
You threaten me with Guantanamo?

223
00:15:53,502 --> 00:15:55,470
If you don't do exactly what I say...

224
00:15:55,638 --> 00:15:58,038
...I will execute you right here.
Do you understand?

225
00:15:59,074 --> 00:16:03,010
Listen, we are your friends, okay?
We're your friends.

226
00:16:03,178 --> 00:16:05,703
We're here to watch you.
We're here to protect you.

227
00:16:06,248 --> 00:16:08,045
You can't even protect yourselves.

228
00:16:18,827 --> 00:16:20,954
<i>Boss?</i>
<i>- Yeah, I'm right here.</i>

229
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:22,791
<i>I got a visual on him.</i>

230
00:16:22,965 --> 00:16:25,024
<i>Okay, where's he coming from?</i>

231
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,259
He's riding up right now.
Coming right to us.

232
00:16:27,436 --> 00:16:29,461
<i>Yes. I see him. I see him.</i>

233
00:16:29,638 --> 00:16:32,664
He's coming down the street.
He's coming north towards the square.

234
00:16:32,841 --> 00:16:36,140
- I'm gonna hang back.
- <i>All right, I'll let you know what he's doing.</i>

235
00:16:36,311 --> 00:16:39,246
Keep an eye on him for me.
- He stopped in front of the café.

236
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,110
He's walking right up.

237
00:16:42,985 --> 00:16:45,010
- <i>Listen, Bassam?</i>
- Yeah?

238
00:16:45,187 --> 00:16:51,217
There is a black van heading this way
with some pretty dangerous-looking guys.

239
00:16:51,393 --> 00:16:54,954
- <i>They're staring right at him.</i>
- Yeah, I see it.

240
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:57,496
<i>Tell me what it does.</i>
<i>- All right.</i>

241
00:16:57,666 --> 00:17:01,568
Looks like it's parking right up ahead.
Yeah, it stopped. The van stopped.

242
00:17:01,737 --> 00:17:02,931
<i>Can I turn around?</i>

243
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,300
Yeah, yeah, Nizar's getting on his bike.

244
00:17:05,474 --> 00:17:08,136
<i>There's like four or five guys</i>
<i>getting out of that van.</i>

245
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:11,768
<i>Can you identify any of these guys?</i>
- I've never seen these guys before.

246
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:12,971
We gotta move.

247
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,658
Did you see a flash?
- What?

248
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,467
Did somebody get hit?

249
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:38,299
Let's see a playback on that.
- Stay with him.

250
00:17:40,175 --> 00:17:43,406
Hello.
- In case you didn't see it, I executed him.

251
00:17:43,579 --> 00:17:44,841
<i>You did what you had to do.</i>

252
00:17:45,013 --> 00:17:49,177
If you hadn't, he would be describing you
down to your eyebrows to them right now.

253
00:17:49,351 --> 00:17:51,649
I did it, all right? It's done. I killed him.

254
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,254
<i>He was always gonna get killed</i>
<i>no matter what he did.</i>

255
00:17:54,423 --> 00:17:56,857
Besides, you'd milked him and he was dry.

256
00:17:57,025 --> 00:17:58,788
Excuse me.

257
00:17:59,762 --> 00:18:01,127
<i>Ferris?</i>

258
00:18:01,296 --> 00:18:03,196
Is your silence supposed
to say something?

259
00:18:03,365 --> 00:18:05,629
Because you do know we're at war, right?

260
00:18:05,801 --> 00:18:09,760
Your friend, who you must have had some
intense cross-cultural eye contact with...

261
00:18:09,938 --> 00:18:12,907
...was a terrorist a-hole,
who turned out to be a coward...

262
00:18:13,075 --> 00:18:14,736
...who wanted to go to Disneyland.

263
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:18,209
Listen, Ed, we're going north now,
do you hear me?

264
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:22,180
- <i>We're going north to the Balad safe house.</i>
- No, no, no, buddy. No, you're not.

265
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,046
You're blown. There's chatter.

266
00:18:24,219 --> 00:18:27,347
Well, if I'm blown, Ed, that means
you should've sent a team here...

267
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:31,584
...the minute Nizar got shot,
but you didn't send a team, did you?

268
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,955
Well, not since we've been talking, Ferris.

269
00:18:34,129 --> 00:18:37,189
You and I, we're going to that safe house,
you understand? Now.

270
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,129
- <i>Ferris?</i>
- Where's the goddamn car, huh?

271
00:18:39,301 --> 00:18:40,325
Let's get out of here.

272
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:13,826
It's time to move.
I'm coming back to you, all right?

273
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,767
If something happens,
you'll shoot me, right?

274
00:19:18,941 --> 00:19:21,273
- Yep.
- Good.

275
00:20:06,722 --> 00:20:08,212
Got you.

276
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:09,948
Don't you fucking do it.

277
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,151
Hassan! Hassan!

278
00:20:22,871 --> 00:20:27,831
Urgent request you dispatch Chili, Speck
or Nitrate to these coordinates.

279
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:39,921
North, 34 degrees, 20 minutes,
16.8 seconds.

280
00:20:40,088 --> 00:20:43,421
<i>East, 44 degrees, 24 minutes,</i>
<i>14.4 seconds.</i>

281
00:20:43,592 --> 00:20:47,323
This is a live target, a known
operational base of an Al-Saleem cell.

282
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:50,056
- A high-value target.
- Copy that, on approach.

283
00:21:13,221 --> 00:21:15,416
Aah! Get back!

284
00:21:25,901 --> 00:21:27,801
Come on!

285
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:30,905
- Gotta go! Gotta go!
- I'm getting the intel!

286
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,768
Get in the fucking car, man!
Come on! Come on!

287
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,011
Go! Go!

288
00:21:53,362 --> 00:21:56,263
I've got guys coming down
the hill! Two trucks! On the right!

289
00:21:56,431 --> 00:21:58,023
I got it.

290
00:21:58,834 --> 00:21:59,892
Keep moving!

291
00:22:25,127 --> 00:22:26,151
Fuck.

292
00:22:26,328 --> 00:22:29,058
We're in some serious
fucking trouble here.

293
00:22:29,231 --> 00:22:32,826
We're on Highway 1, south of Samarra.
We're being pursued by two vehicles.

294
00:22:33,001 --> 00:22:35,697
<i>We have valuable intel in our possession!</i>

295
00:22:35,871 --> 00:22:38,704
We're in a black Nissan.
Where the fuck are you people?

296
00:22:38,874 --> 00:22:41,365
- I see them!
<i>- We're right on their six.</i>

297
00:22:44,179 --> 00:22:46,875
- <i>Have visual, will engage.</i>
- Copy that. Engage at will.

298
00:22:59,828 --> 00:23:01,853
RPG. Take them out now.

299
00:23:07,869 --> 00:23:09,336
<i>Fire!</i>

300
00:23:09,504 --> 00:23:10,971
RPG!

301
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,304
<i>Nine, one, two, six, one.</i>

302
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,248
Let's go!

303
00:23:27,022 --> 00:23:29,752
- Fuel tank is ruptured!
- I got him! Get the driver out!

304
00:23:29,925 --> 00:23:33,019
I can't! He's in pieces!
- Then get the bag! Get the intel!

305
00:23:34,096 --> 00:23:35,529
Bassam! Bassam!

306
00:23:36,198 --> 00:23:39,167
Stay with them. We are tracking.

307
00:23:40,569 --> 00:23:42,434
- Bassam!
Get his legs!

308
00:23:43,271 --> 00:23:46,331
No!
- Intel secure!

309
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,271
Let's go! Stay down.

310
00:23:49,244 --> 00:23:50,506
Come on, buddy.

311
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:53,047
Come on. Get him out, now!

312
00:24:08,263 --> 00:24:10,026
<i>He's dead.</i>

313
00:24:14,402 --> 00:24:15,801
Who are you?

314
00:24:15,971 --> 00:24:17,097
What's your name?

315
00:24:17,272 --> 00:24:20,207
Do you know where you are? Come on!

316
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:22,634
Fuck.

317
00:24:37,092 --> 00:24:38,582
What's that?

318
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,284
Bone fragments.

319
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,390
Not yours.

320
00:24:49,004 --> 00:24:52,462
- They get that stuff I sent out?
- All uploaded to Langley.

321
00:24:52,641 --> 00:24:54,370
Mr. Hoffman.

322
00:24:56,478 --> 00:24:58,878
- Hey, Ed.
<i>- Ferris.</i>

323
00:24:59,047 --> 00:25:03,040
- <i>Christmas came early, buddy.</i>
- Oh, yeah? What'd I get for Christmas, Ed?

324
00:25:03,218 --> 00:25:07,154
Well, 15 pages of this, 40 pages of that.

325
00:25:07,322 --> 00:25:11,816
I got, like, about 712 phone numbers
that are new to us...

326
00:25:11,993 --> 00:25:13,824
...that we can strip and evaluate...

327
00:25:13,995 --> 00:25:17,089
...and amongst other things,
a safe house in Amman.

328
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:19,733
I've got jihadists coming and going
from this place...

329
00:25:19,901 --> 00:25:21,869
...like it's happy hour at the Cat House.

330
00:25:22,504 --> 00:25:23,664
You gotta see this place.

331
00:25:24,306 --> 00:25:28,504
Before we get into that, I wanna know
what you're doing for Bassam's family, Ed.

332
00:25:28,677 --> 00:25:30,167
I didn't know the man.

333
00:25:30,345 --> 00:25:32,905
What are you doing for Bassam's family?
He was your guy.

334
00:25:33,081 --> 00:25:34,605
<i>So now you don't know him, huh?</i>

335
00:25:35,984 --> 00:25:39,613
<i>You'll be going to Amman</i>
<i>as acting station chief.</i>

336
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:43,053
You'll outrank Holiday. No matter
what he says, you're the show-runner.

337
00:25:43,225 --> 00:25:47,457
<i>You'll liaise with Jordanian GID,</i>
<i>who are as hot for Al-Saleem as we are.</i>

338
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:49,893
You'll be working with
a guy named Hani Salaam...

339
00:25:50,065 --> 00:25:52,590
...who is not your run-of-the-mill
fingernail-puller.

340
00:25:52,767 --> 00:25:54,166
Hani is a professional.

341
00:25:54,336 --> 00:25:56,327
And will I be sharing information
with him?

342
00:25:56,504 --> 00:25:59,371
<i>Let me say this about that: No.</i>

343
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:03,269
Now, you wanna take a few weeks off
and go bang the wife?

344
00:26:03,445 --> 00:26:07,142
I'm getting a divorce, Ed. You know that.
You know more about it than I do.

345
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:10,375
<i>Everybody around here screws up</i>
<i>their marriage, buddy. Why not you?</i>

346
00:26:11,453 --> 00:26:12,647
So you'll go to Amman?

347
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:19,085
I will go to Amman. I'll call you later.

348
00:26:58,767 --> 00:27:02,703
This car is a real pile of shit.
Is this the best they could afford?

349
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:06,432
I brought this car in case you wanted
to cruise the safe house now, you know?

350
00:27:06,608 --> 00:27:10,009
No one cruises that safe house, all right?

351
00:27:10,178 --> 00:27:13,341
I need to take a shit, I need a shower
and an Internet connection...

352
00:27:13,515 --> 00:27:16,211
...so just take me to my apartment,
all right?

353
00:27:17,152 --> 00:27:19,586
Got you in a high-rise.

354
00:27:19,754 --> 00:27:22,552
Hot and cold water. And you can drink it.

355
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,453
- Great.
- There's not much local color.

356
00:27:25,026 --> 00:27:27,392
I've had it with the local color.
Thank you.

357
00:27:43,511 --> 00:27:45,672
Cheap-ass motherfuckers.

358
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,917
Morning, sir.

359
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:54,680
He's clear.

360
00:27:57,292 --> 00:27:59,692
NSA is listening to the phones
and computer links...

361
00:27:59,861 --> 00:28:01,692
...of anyone who's been near the house.

362
00:28:01,863 --> 00:28:05,629
Look, they don't have to be geniuses
to stop using their e-mail and cell phones.

363
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,064
I don't understand why
you haven't figured out...

364
00:28:08,236 --> 00:28:11,069
...that they're not communicating
electronically anymore.

365
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:14,673
The house is owned
by a family named Alousi.

366
00:28:14,843 --> 00:28:18,176
And in my opinion, it just seems
like a normal Jordanian family...

367
00:28:18,346 --> 00:28:20,041
...with a lot of country relatives.

368
00:28:20,215 --> 00:28:21,580
Normal Jordanian family.

369
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:27,746
But all of them are unmarried males
between the ages of 18 and 35, correct?

370
00:28:27,922 --> 00:28:30,322
Listen, kid,
whatever information you got in Iraq...

371
00:28:30,492 --> 00:28:33,552
...I just don't think this house
is what you think it is.

372
00:28:33,728 --> 00:28:37,687
These boys drink alcohol, they chase girls,
they smoke hash, and...

373
00:28:37,866 --> 00:28:39,333
So did Mohamed Atta, right?

374
00:28:39,501 --> 00:28:41,867
- It's Takfir methodology.
- Takfir methodology.

375
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:45,837
Correct. It's permitted in order
to deceive the infidel.

376
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:49,538
You've had guys watching them
go in and out of this safe house here...

377
00:28:49,711 --> 00:28:50,905
...but what I don't get...

378
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:53,877
...is why you haven't had anyone
monitoring them after.

379
00:28:54,048 --> 00:28:56,573
Well, there's so much activity
at this location...

380
00:28:56,751 --> 00:29:00,209
...that we have exhausted the station's
indigenous-appearing manpower.

381
00:29:00,388 --> 00:29:03,619
So you don't have enough good Arab guys
to follow the bad Arab guys...

382
00:29:03,792 --> 00:29:05,657
...is what you're saying.
- That's right.

383
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:08,523
Well, you're gonna need
some more human surveillance...

384
00:29:08,696 --> 00:29:10,857
...loaners from Jordanian Intelligence.

385
00:29:11,366 --> 00:29:12,526
All right. Skip, get out.

386
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,837
Now, I am in receipt of a directive...

387
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:27,607
...which tells me that I am
to make myself useful to you...

388
00:29:27,782 --> 00:29:31,718
...in whichever way
that you request or require.

389
00:29:31,886 --> 00:29:35,845
But it is my feeling that to involve
the Jordanian secret service...

390
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,288
...is a breach of operational integrity.

391
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:41,725
You don't need to tell me
about Jordanian Intelligence, all right?

392
00:29:41,896 --> 00:29:44,956
They are doing a far superior job
than you are, my friend.

393
00:29:45,133 --> 00:29:46,760
You've read that directive there...

394
00:29:46,935 --> 00:29:49,802
...which clearly states that I am in charge
of this operation.

395
00:29:49,971 --> 00:29:52,963
So, what I need you to do
is leave this office immediately...

396
00:29:53,141 --> 00:29:55,075
...and hand your entire staff over to me.

397
00:29:57,946 --> 00:30:02,144
You know, we've all watched your rise
in the Near East Division.

398
00:30:03,084 --> 00:30:04,574
I'll see you on the way down.

399
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,551
You and Hoffman both.

400
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,697
I need you to help me out
and get me a fresh pot of coffee, please...

401
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:24,930
...and a full staff meeting
within the next 15 minutes, all right?

402
00:30:25,106 --> 00:30:27,074
To be fair to Mr. Holiday, Mr. Ferris...

403
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:29,938
...Mr. Hoffman never told us
this would be such a big deal.

404
00:30:30,111 --> 00:30:32,443
Ed Hoffman is the head
of the Near East Division.

405
00:30:32,614 --> 00:30:36,846
But he does not know shit until he steals it
from the guy on the ground, and that's me.

406
00:30:37,018 --> 00:30:39,543
Now, please stop acting
like such a fucking ingénue...

407
00:30:39,721 --> 00:30:43,418
...and try to get me a meeting
with Hani Salaam. Thanks.

408
00:30:59,707 --> 00:31:01,607
Mr. Ferris.

409
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:17,021
Hani Pasha.

410
00:31:17,191 --> 00:31:19,625
Pasha? That is an Ottoman term.

411
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:23,025
Well, I hear you like it, sir.
Pleasure to meet you.

412
00:31:23,565 --> 00:31:26,864
- Mr. Ferris, please take a seat.
- Thank you, sir.

413
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:33,073
- Welcome to our promising country.
- Thank you so much.

414
00:31:33,241 --> 00:31:37,803
As reliable as your Ed Hoffman would call
a "towelhead monarchy" can be.

415
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:40,880
Well, we'll leave that to Ed Hoffman, sir.

416
00:31:41,583 --> 00:31:43,050
Mm.

417
00:31:45,887 --> 00:31:47,980
What have you heard about this building?

418
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:52,650
Well, to be quite honest,
I hear they call it the fingernail factory.

419
00:31:53,528 --> 00:31:55,928
But no one close to you would say that,
of course.

420
00:31:56,097 --> 00:31:57,564
No.

421
00:31:58,066 --> 00:32:00,534
But people are stupid.

422
00:32:01,469 --> 00:32:05,030
Torture doesn't work.

423
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:09,940
Under torture, a man will say
almost anything to make the pain stop.

424
00:32:11,613 --> 00:32:13,740
You have experience with this, I am sure.

425
00:32:16,818 --> 00:32:18,342
Mr. Ferris, here in Jordan...

426
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:21,955
...to the fundamentalists, you see,
I am, myself, the enemy.

427
00:32:22,724 --> 00:32:24,749
Perhaps the worst kind.

428
00:32:25,827 --> 00:32:30,127
Take not the Jews and Christians as allies.
Do you know it, Mr. Ferris?

429
00:32:36,738 --> 00:32:39,138
The dar-al-Harb. Very good.

430
00:32:39,307 --> 00:32:43,073
We are together, Hani Pasha,
in this House of War, yes.

431
00:32:43,244 --> 00:32:46,236
You are smarter than the Americans
who are usually sent to Amman.

432
00:32:46,414 --> 00:32:50,009
- Thank you, sir.
- I knew this, of course, before you came.

433
00:32:50,518 --> 00:32:53,919
You are young,
but you respect your elders.

434
00:32:54,088 --> 00:32:56,488
- You speak Arabic...
- Mm.

435
00:32:56,691 --> 00:32:59,353
...so you are a secret Arab.
- Mm.

436
00:33:07,435 --> 00:33:08,629
Now, ahem...

437
00:33:08,803 --> 00:33:11,636
We've recently discovered
a large Al-Saleem safe house...

438
00:33:11,806 --> 00:33:13,967
...and training cell here in Amman.

439
00:33:14,142 --> 00:33:16,235
I would need your help
with surveillance, sir.

440
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:20,646
Now, this is what we know so far.

441
00:33:21,783 --> 00:33:22,807
This is unusual.

442
00:33:24,385 --> 00:33:27,616
Your Ed Hoffman would rather have less
information than share with me.

443
00:33:28,523 --> 00:33:31,856
Well, this is not Ed Hoffman.
This is not my predecessor.

444
00:33:32,026 --> 00:33:34,859
This is me, sir. Please, have a look.

445
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:49,106
I have one rule...

446
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,871
...if we are to cooperate, my dear.

447
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,313
Never lie to me.

448
00:33:56,484 --> 00:33:58,315
Understand?

449
00:33:58,486 --> 00:34:00,283
Never lie to me.

450
00:34:04,859 --> 00:34:06,690
You shall have your agents.

451
00:34:06,861 --> 00:34:08,658
Thank you, sir.

452
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:12,155
Agent Ferris is arriving at the site now.

453
00:34:12,333 --> 00:34:13,766
Thank you.

454
00:34:13,935 --> 00:34:16,961
Tracking now.
- Roger that, I'll reposition the aircraft.

455
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,537
Slewing to 2.5.

456
00:34:28,249 --> 00:34:32,208
There it is. That's it.
That's the safe house.

457
00:34:37,725 --> 00:34:39,192
Come on.

458
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,463
- What do you wanna do with this guy?
- Just watch.

459
00:34:47,635 --> 00:34:50,331
Watch him and what else?
- Nothing else.

460
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:53,903
I'm not sure about this GID surveillance.

461
00:34:54,575 --> 00:34:57,874
- I can't see any of Hani's guys.
- Well, I've spotted a few so far.

462
00:34:58,045 --> 00:35:01,537
You see the two by the doorway there
in front of the safe house?

463
00:35:01,716 --> 00:35:03,183
There's one more selling radios.

464
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:06,081
And there's one behind me
with a striped shirt.

465
00:35:06,254 --> 00:35:07,744
That's what I've clocked so far.

466
00:35:10,658 --> 00:35:13,252
Who's this? Who just sat down?

467
00:35:13,427 --> 00:35:15,019
That's one of our guys.

468
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:18,393
- One of your guys? What do you...?
- A station asset.

469
00:35:18,566 --> 00:35:19,760
Zayed Ibishi.

470
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:22,931
He's one of our contacts
from the Palestinian camps.

471
00:35:23,104 --> 00:35:24,833
Station asset, huh?

472
00:35:25,006 --> 00:35:27,440
What the fuck is he doing
making contact right now?

473
00:35:27,608 --> 00:35:31,066
- And how come I don't know about this?
- I don't know. I don't know.

474
00:35:31,612 --> 00:35:35,708
If he makes that jihadist suspicious,
they will shut down that house and leave.

475
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:39,319
- He's gonna get that guy killed.
- He's gonna blow this whole operation.

476
00:35:40,188 --> 00:35:41,883
Not again. Fucking Hoffman!

477
00:35:48,663 --> 00:35:50,995
- Oops.
- Continue tracking.

478
00:35:51,165 --> 00:35:52,325
Area expanded.

479
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,933
Tracking.

480
00:36:05,446 --> 00:36:07,505
Head him off! Head him off!

481
00:36:10,651 --> 00:36:12,778
Going down the alley.
- Adjusting coverage.

482
00:36:12,954 --> 00:36:13,978
Boost image factor.

483
00:36:20,161 --> 00:36:22,152
Switching to SAR.
- Stay with sweep.

484
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,793
Hold image?
- Image locked.

485
00:36:30,171 --> 00:36:31,297
Ah!

486
00:36:55,529 --> 00:36:58,259
Skip. I got him.

487
00:36:58,432 --> 00:37:00,866
I need you to come pick me up, all right?

488
00:37:01,035 --> 00:37:05,062
I got bit by fucking diseased dogs,
goddamn it.

489
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:07,207
I'm by the clearing.

490
00:37:07,375 --> 00:37:09,570
Yeah, just look out for me.

491
00:37:18,252 --> 00:37:21,221
You gotta be kidding me.
Come on, take me to a real hospital.

492
00:37:21,389 --> 00:37:23,584
- Take me to the embassy.
- That's like an hour.

493
00:37:23,758 --> 00:37:27,819
Rabies around here is no joke. You're gonna
need a jab in there, ASAP. Let's go.

494
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:29,485
Let's go.

495
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:37,861
Let's get you vaccinated. Aisha.

496
00:37:54,221 --> 00:37:55,245
AISHA

497
00:37:57,625 --> 00:37:59,058
Let me see.

498
00:38:02,129 --> 00:38:03,892
These are not bite wounds.

499
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:07,296
- A snowboarding accident.
- Snowboarding.

500
00:38:07,468 --> 00:38:10,960
- Mm.
- You're accident prone, huh?

501
00:38:11,138 --> 00:38:15,074
Well, I mean,
I'm sure it looks that way. Yeah.

502
00:38:15,242 --> 00:38:17,142
Okay.

503
00:38:23,751 --> 00:38:25,514
Relax.

504
00:38:26,687 --> 00:38:29,781
All right. Let me...

505
00:38:35,262 --> 00:38:38,288
My father was Iranian.

506
00:38:39,433 --> 00:38:41,731
I live in Amman now.

507
00:38:45,373 --> 00:38:47,307
Okay.

508
00:38:48,175 --> 00:38:50,143
This is going to hurt.

509
00:38:50,444 --> 00:38:52,378
Mm. I don't like needles.

510
00:38:52,546 --> 00:38:54,844
Just think about something else, hm?

511
00:38:58,719 --> 00:38:59,743
Okay.

512
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:05,984
This is the first of five anti-rabies injections
you'll need over the next month.

513
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,684
You don't need to come back here.

514
00:39:07,862 --> 00:39:12,026
You can get them at any clinic.
One each week, right?

515
00:39:12,566 --> 00:39:15,126
- So we're done?
- Yeah, we're done.

516
00:39:15,302 --> 00:39:18,100
And someone will come
to bandage your wounds.

517
00:39:19,507 --> 00:39:21,168
Thank you.

518
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:24,570
<i>You fucking cocksucker. How did</i>
<i>you expect me to run an operation...</i>

519
00:39:24,745 --> 00:39:27,839
<i>... when you're running a side operation</i>
<i>which fucks up my own?</i>

520
00:39:28,015 --> 00:39:31,382
Listen, you want me to run Amman,
let me run Amman, all right?

521
00:39:31,552 --> 00:39:34,578
I have made promises to Hani Salaam.
Do you understand that?

522
00:39:34,755 --> 00:39:36,245
Uh-huh. What's your point?

523
00:39:36,424 --> 00:39:40,019
<i>My point is, Ed, you can't pull</i>
<i>your normal bullshit here, all right?</i>

524
00:39:40,194 --> 00:39:44,221
- We have to respect what he wants.
- I do respect him. What kind of thing?

525
00:39:44,398 --> 00:39:49,062
Look, you keep fucking around like this, and
you are gonna blow this Amman operation.

526
00:39:49,236 --> 00:39:51,636
- I love you. Bye.
- I love you too.

527
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:55,367
They'll vacate their only known safe house,
and we'll never hear from them.

528
00:39:55,543 --> 00:39:57,943
- Do you understand?
- I'm just trying to back you up.

529
00:39:58,112 --> 00:40:00,171
It's a dangerous,
dangerous world out there.

530
00:40:00,347 --> 00:40:03,248
Well, don't back me up,
because I don't need it, all right?

531
00:40:03,784 --> 00:40:06,719
- Hani.
- I gotta go deal with this Hani bullshit.

532
00:40:06,887 --> 00:40:10,254
- So go fuck yourself.
- All right, whatever.

533
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,524
You ready to go?

534
00:40:13,694 --> 00:40:15,594
Whatever.

535
00:40:32,613 --> 00:40:35,514
Hani Pasha, if you would give me
an opportunity to ex...

536
00:40:36,884 --> 00:40:39,045
Fortunately the safe house is still there.

537
00:40:40,955 --> 00:40:43,981
As for the man you killed,
you were right.

538
00:40:44,158 --> 00:40:45,955
You made a good decision.

539
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:50,327
The jihadists believe it was a robbery.
There are many robberies in that district.

540
00:40:50,498 --> 00:40:53,160
So you have been very clever, my dear.

541
00:40:53,334 --> 00:40:55,700
Well, that's good news, sir.

542
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,394
Listen, Ed Hoffman had...

543
00:40:57,571 --> 00:41:00,699
I have spoken to Mr. Hoffman
very sharply.

544
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,742
Now, we will explain
the king's espionage laws to his agent.

545
00:41:24,131 --> 00:41:27,532
I thought you didn't believe in torture,
Hani Pasha.

546
00:41:27,701 --> 00:41:31,296
This is punishment, my dear.
It's a very different thing.

547
00:41:35,976 --> 00:41:37,876
Keep watching.

548
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:41,138
Tell Edward what you have seen.

549
00:42:57,591 --> 00:43:00,082
<i>Another deadly attack on innocent civilians.</i>

550
00:43:00,261 --> 00:43:04,197
<i>This time in one of Amsterdam's</i>
<i>most crowded tourist districts.</i>

551
00:43:04,365 --> 00:43:07,926
<i>The images of the bombing were captured</i>
<i>on location surveillance cameras.</i>

552
00:43:08,102 --> 00:43:10,229
<i>The blast felt for miles.</i>

553
00:43:10,404 --> 00:43:13,703
<i>What was once a block-long farmer market</i>
<i>vibrant with color...</i>

554
00:43:13,874 --> 00:43:15,501
<i>... is now in ruins and covered with ash.</i>

555
00:43:18,279 --> 00:43:20,144
<i>The exact number of casualties</i>
<i>is not yet known...</i>

556
00:43:20,314 --> 00:43:22,839
<i>... as emergency crews</i>
<i>are still pulling victims from the rubble.</i>

557
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:27,010
<i>But officials are saying it will certainly be</i>
<i>in triple figures.</i>

558
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:31,457
<i>KLPD antiterror-unit investigators</i>
<i>have arrived...</i>

559
00:43:31,625 --> 00:43:35,322
<i>... and are examining bomb fragments</i>
<i>in the hope of determining if this...</i>

560
00:43:35,496 --> 00:43:39,762
<i>... and the other recent bombings on the</i>
<i>continent and in the UK are connected.</i>

561
00:43:39,933 --> 00:43:44,302
<i>The consequence of a new bombing</i>
<i>will no doubt have a devastating effect...</i>

562
00:43:44,471 --> 00:43:46,769
<i>... on Europe's tourist business.</i>

563
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:50,467
<i>Let's go now</i>
<i>to Amsterdam's chief of police.</i>

564
00:43:50,644 --> 00:43:55,411
<i>We will do whatever we can</i>
<i>to keep everyone safe...</i>

565
00:43:55,582 --> 00:43:59,018
<i>... for you to live every day</i>
<i>without being afraid.</i>

566
00:43:59,186 --> 00:44:01,381
<i>But we must be realistic.</i>

567
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:07,084
<i>Terrorist threats are real, present,</i>
<i>deadly and persistent.</i>

568
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:12,498
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

569
00:44:14,635 --> 00:44:15,659
Where are we going?

570
00:44:15,836 --> 00:44:17,736
We are going fishing.

571
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,463
Get in.

572
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:29,112
Since no credit was claimed
for the bombing...

573
00:44:29,283 --> 00:44:32,047
...we believe it to be the work
of Al-Saleem.

574
00:44:32,219 --> 00:44:34,687
That's his signature. Anonymity.

575
00:44:35,723 --> 00:44:38,123
So, what we need is... May I say we?

576
00:44:38,292 --> 00:44:41,750
Of course.
As long as we keep it between us.

577
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:44,761
We need a man inside the Amman cell.

578
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:46,399
We do. Yes.

579
00:44:46,567 --> 00:44:48,159
And we shall have the man we need.

580
00:44:48,335 --> 00:44:51,998
- How's that?
- Because you gave him to me.

581
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:56,973
<i>His name is Mustafa Karami.</i>
<i>I've known him since he was a teenager...</i>

582
00:44:57,144 --> 00:45:00,011
<i>... selling boom boxes</i>
<i>from the back of a stolen truck.</i>

583
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:02,876
<i>Now he's al Qaeda. In my country.</i>

584
00:45:04,218 --> 00:45:05,845
<i>Watch and learn, my dear.</i>

585
00:45:06,019 --> 00:45:07,281
Watch and learn.

586
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:44,654
KARAMI:

587
00:45:46,126 --> 00:45:48,993
You did not think to tell Hani Salaam
you are a jihadist?

588
00:45:50,197 --> 00:45:53,462
You have become a religious man, hm?

589
00:45:53,634 --> 00:45:55,226
No longer a thief.

590
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,933
Can it be true?

591
00:45:59,072 --> 00:46:00,232
Here.

592
00:46:02,109 --> 00:46:03,303
Take the phone.

593
00:46:03,477 --> 00:46:05,911
Take it and talk to your mother.

594
00:46:06,547 --> 00:46:08,014
Talk.

595
00:46:11,084 --> 00:46:13,245
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>
- Hello.

596
00:46:14,955 --> 00:46:18,288
His mother was in the Palestinian camps.

597
00:46:18,459 --> 00:46:22,020
Now she has a fine apartment
and a beautiful garden.

598
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:25,529
She can watch the sun set over the hills.

599
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:30,796
She has a refrigerator, couch,
even a television set.

600
00:46:30,971 --> 00:46:34,839
She will tell him she is proud of him, that
she always knew he would be a success...

601
00:46:35,008 --> 00:46:37,533
...even when he was a little boy
in the refugee camps.

602
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:39,645
And now he has sent her money.

603
00:46:39,813 --> 00:46:41,974
She is glad he is no longer mixed up
with the radicals.

604
00:46:56,196 --> 00:46:59,290
You are God's blessing to your mother,
Mustafa.

605
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,935
You have done none of these things for her.
But you should have.

606
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:06,671
A mother is worth more
than anything they have told you.

607
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:11,209
You know, you will be better in the future
because we have sent her many gifts...

608
00:47:11,378 --> 00:47:13,972
...and we have told her these gifts come
from her son.

609
00:47:18,452 --> 00:47:19,885
HANI:

610
00:47:20,721 --> 00:47:23,246
Continue your life with your brothers
in al Qaeda.

611
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:25,618
We will devise a way to talk. Come.

612
00:47:27,294 --> 00:47:30,422
Come. No, no, no. Come, come, come.

613
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:33,293
Up, up, up.

614
00:47:36,303 --> 00:47:37,600
Go.

615
00:47:44,044 --> 00:47:47,605
And so we throw him back into the sea,
to swim where he naturally swims...

616
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:50,545
...to learn what he naturally learns...

617
00:47:50,717 --> 00:47:53,447
...and see how long he remembers
my benevolence.

618
00:47:54,922 --> 00:47:56,321
And what if he forgets?

619
00:47:57,491 --> 00:48:01,655
If he forgets, I remind him that I have
the power of life and death over him...

620
00:48:01,828 --> 00:48:06,231
...because, you see, any time I wish,
I can let them know he works for me.

621
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:08,764
Hm.

622
00:48:11,538 --> 00:48:12,664
<i>Ed?</i>

623
00:48:12,839 --> 00:48:14,704
<i>So tell me about Hani's guy.</i>

624
00:48:14,875 --> 00:48:16,775
- Who?
- <i>Karami, the guy on the bike.</i>

625
00:48:16,944 --> 00:48:19,378
<i>What do you think I do in my spare time,</i>
<i>play tennis?</i>

626
00:48:19,546 --> 00:48:22,709
- <i>I look like a tennis player to you?</i>
- It's not gonna happen, Ed.

627
00:48:22,883 --> 00:48:26,785
<i>Buddy, we're a results-oriented</i>
<i>organization, and we need results now...</i>

628
00:48:26,954 --> 00:48:28,854
<i>... because otherwise I will be unhappy.</i>

629
00:48:29,022 --> 00:48:31,286
You'll be unhappy, and he'll say, <i>"Insa."</i>

630
00:48:31,458 --> 00:48:32,550
<i>What does that mean?</i>

631
00:48:32,726 --> 00:48:34,557
Means "too fucking bad,"
is what it means.

632
00:48:34,728 --> 00:48:38,095
<i>Too fucking bad?</i>
<i>Europe is getting hammered, boy. All right?</i>

633
00:48:38,265 --> 00:48:40,358
<i>Nobody knows where the next bomb</i>
<i>is going off.</i>

634
00:48:40,534 --> 00:48:42,525
<i>There's 75 dead in Amsterdam.</i>

635
00:48:42,703 --> 00:48:45,137
<i>You can call me sentimental</i>
<i>if you want to, buddy...</i>

636
00:48:45,305 --> 00:48:47,034
Ed, listen, Hani does not trust you.

637
00:48:47,207 --> 00:48:49,198
Arabs will only help you if they trust you.

638
00:48:49,376 --> 00:48:51,344
We need to earn that trust,
you understand?

639
00:48:51,511 --> 00:48:52,705
<i>What are you, moving here?</i>

640
00:48:52,879 --> 00:48:57,077
<i>I don't care about cultural insecurity issues.</i>
<i>I don't care if Hani trusts me or not.</i>

641
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:59,912
<i>What he will do is he will thank me</i>
<i>in the long run. Fuck.</i>

642
00:49:00,087 --> 00:49:02,078
<i>Hold on. Hold on.</i>

643
00:49:03,724 --> 00:49:05,521
Buddy, you're home.

644
00:49:06,927 --> 00:49:09,828
Jesus Christ, Ed,
you scared the shit out of me.

645
00:49:09,997 --> 00:49:12,761
They say that you should
never drink red wine in the desert.

646
00:49:12,933 --> 00:49:14,901
That's what did in the Babylonians, right?

647
00:49:15,068 --> 00:49:18,902
Well, a couple of bottles of that
and we'll be speaking Babylonian.

648
00:49:19,072 --> 00:49:21,939
So how was your flight?

649
00:49:22,109 --> 00:49:25,943
Oh, it was fine. It was fine.
Yeah. I watched that <i>Poseidon.</i>

650
00:49:27,314 --> 00:49:30,442
I see you've made yourself at home.

651
00:49:44,931 --> 00:49:47,491
In the words of the great Sam Snead:

652
00:49:47,668 --> 00:49:51,764
"If you're not thinking about pussy,
you're just not concentrating."

653
00:49:51,938 --> 00:49:53,098
My dear.

654
00:49:53,273 --> 00:49:55,070
Jesus Christ. Come on.

655
00:49:57,811 --> 00:49:59,369
Hani Pasha.

656
00:49:59,546 --> 00:50:00,979
Thank you for your time.

657
00:50:01,148 --> 00:50:02,410
Please.

658
00:50:03,050 --> 00:50:06,542
I'm gonna need a piece of this guy you got
here in this Amman cell.

659
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:09,280
Don't look at buddy.
Buddy didn't say nothing.

660
00:50:09,456 --> 00:50:13,324
These jihadists might not use their cell
phones, Hani, but you do use yours, right?

661
00:50:13,994 --> 00:50:15,018
Please.

662
00:50:15,195 --> 00:50:18,130
Now, don't say no before I say anything.

663
00:50:18,298 --> 00:50:20,926
Just let me say
what I've come here to say.

664
00:50:21,868 --> 00:50:27,101
Thank you. You have done an incredible job
developing this guy Karoobi.

665
00:50:28,008 --> 00:50:29,236
Katoomi.

666
00:50:29,409 --> 00:50:31,036
- Karami.
- Karami.

667
00:50:31,211 --> 00:50:35,705
Now, we develop these assets
to use them as needed.

668
00:50:35,882 --> 00:50:37,110
And I have a need.

669
00:50:38,018 --> 00:50:39,849
No.

670
00:50:42,856 --> 00:50:46,348
- I'm just gonna get all frustrated here.
- Why are you frustrated, Edward?

671
00:50:46,526 --> 00:50:48,187
Because we have a partnership.

672
00:50:48,361 --> 00:50:50,693
You have something that I need
that will help me...

673
00:50:50,864 --> 00:50:52,491
...and you won't allow that to happen.

674
00:50:52,666 --> 00:50:55,829
And I'm trying to impress upon you
a sense of urgency.

675
00:50:56,002 --> 00:51:00,496
Urgency does not call for changing methods
that work for methods that do not work.

676
00:51:01,374 --> 00:51:03,433
Now, who pays the bills around here?

677
00:51:03,610 --> 00:51:06,477
I would hate to have to have my president
call your king.

678
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:09,206
Because that's just gonna
be embarrassing for all of us.

679
00:51:09,382 --> 00:51:13,148
In matters of intelligence, Edward,
you are speaking to the king.

680
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,083
- Is that right?
- Mm.

681
00:51:15,889 --> 00:51:19,655
Well, Your Highness, I want control.

682
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:23,523
- As a favor to the United States.
- You can't have it.

683
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:28,725
I could tell you we will run him jointly,
but it would not be the truth.

684
00:51:28,902 --> 00:51:33,134
Real intelligence operations,
they remain secret forever.

685
00:51:34,141 --> 00:51:39,272
You Americans, you are incapable
of secrecy because you are a democracy.

686
00:51:39,446 --> 00:51:42,609
Now, I know my business.

687
00:51:42,783 --> 00:51:45,217
I have never failed you, have I?

688
00:51:45,385 --> 00:51:50,652
No, you have not. Are you sure
you wanna make this the first time?

689
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:53,690
Edward, you're missing the point.

690
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,725
Karami, he doesn't know anything.

691
00:51:55,896 --> 00:51:58,364
That is not the way
the organization operates.

692
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:02,730
I will ask him what he knows
when it is time.

693
00:52:02,903 --> 00:52:06,270
- Now, are you happy?
- I'm getting there.

694
00:52:08,074 --> 00:52:10,372
Now, you guys
might have invented algebra...

695
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:12,876
...but we're the guys
that found out how to use it.

696
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:16,106
I presume you know who that is?

697
00:52:16,283 --> 00:52:18,183
It's a recent photograph of Al-Saleem.

698
00:52:18,351 --> 00:52:20,615
You didn't have that one, did you?

699
00:52:20,787 --> 00:52:23,551
Well, that's yours.
You can keep that because we're partners.

700
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:27,591
All right? Now, I'm fulfilling my side
of the bargain, okay?

701
00:52:27,761 --> 00:52:31,197
Now's the time for some reciprocity.

702
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:34,597
You need to give me Karami.

703
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:41,664
<i>Insa.</i>

704
00:52:42,943 --> 00:52:47,744
- That's, "Too fucking bad."
- I know what that means.

705
00:52:48,615 --> 00:52:50,810
Well, that was
fucking embarrassing, hm?

706
00:52:51,718 --> 00:52:53,709
You still thinking about pussy, Ed?

707
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:58,153
Don't be a smart aleck.
Thing about that Hani, he's bright.

708
00:52:58,325 --> 00:53:00,725
But he's also arrogant.
That's gonna be his undoing.

709
00:53:00,894 --> 00:53:03,124
You're talking about him, right?

710
00:53:03,296 --> 00:53:04,490
Just flow with me, buddy.

711
00:53:04,664 --> 00:53:08,361
Jesus Christ. You have a recent photograph
of Al-Saleem.

712
00:53:08,535 --> 00:53:11,163
Don't you think I could've used intel
like that, Ed?

713
00:53:11,338 --> 00:53:13,806
What the hell else
are you holding back from me?

714
00:53:13,974 --> 00:53:15,032
What do you wanna know?

715
00:53:15,208 --> 00:53:17,176
Well, for one thing, what's his real name?

716
00:53:17,344 --> 00:53:20,006
Kareem Al-Shams.

717
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:22,213
His birthplace?

718
00:53:22,382 --> 00:53:25,283
Syria. Hama.

719
00:53:26,386 --> 00:53:28,081
Background?

720
00:53:28,255 --> 00:53:32,658
Well, his loving middle-class family
got killed by Hafez Assad...

721
00:53:32,826 --> 00:53:35,124
<i>... so he moved to Saudi Arabia.</i>

722
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:39,755
<i>Studied physics and engineering in Riyadh,</i>
<i>then here in Amman.</i>

723
00:53:39,933 --> 00:53:43,733
<i>Post-graduate study at the University of</i>
<i>North Carolina. He's a Tar Heel like you.</i>

724
00:53:43,904 --> 00:53:47,772
<i>Now, he prides himself on his humility</i>
<i>and not having to take the credit.</i>

725
00:53:47,941 --> 00:53:51,399
<i>Yet this is the same man who will go</i>
<i>on videotape with his brothers...</i>

726
00:53:51,578 --> 00:53:54,308
<i>... describing what he's done</i>
<i>and what's gonna come.</i>

727
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:57,507
<i>His is a false humility.</i>
<i>It's a false modesty.</i>

728
00:53:57,684 --> 00:54:01,211
<i>His ego is more powerful than his beliefs,</i>
<i>more dangerous.</i>

729
00:54:01,388 --> 00:54:03,049
<i>And that is his weakness.</i>

730
00:54:03,223 --> 00:54:08,752
<i>Now, all we got to do, Ferris,</i>
<i>is just get that fucker on the phone.</i>

731
00:54:13,199 --> 00:54:14,223
Ed?

732
00:54:14,401 --> 00:54:16,028
Yeah.

733
00:54:16,202 --> 00:54:20,639
Don't do anything about Karami, huh?
Don't try to flip him or anything like that.

734
00:54:20,807 --> 00:54:22,968
Hani will throw me out.
I promise you that.

735
00:54:23,143 --> 00:54:24,872
This operation will be over.

736
00:54:25,979 --> 00:54:29,676
You cannot trust Hani. Am I clear?

737
00:54:30,550 --> 00:54:32,381
You're clear.

738
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:36,917
Good. You and I gotta get drunk
because I need to sleep on the plane.

739
00:54:37,090 --> 00:54:40,491
I have to take the kids
to <i>The Lion King.</i> Again.

740
00:54:41,761 --> 00:54:43,023
Never have kids.

741
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:47,856
- Ed, did you hear what I said, right?
- Oh, yeah.

742
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:52,334
- Don't... Don't touch Karami.
- All right.

743
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:54,772
Never.

744
00:55:11,191 --> 00:55:13,557
That's Karami. We're on. Get the van.

745
00:55:45,492 --> 00:55:47,653
Move the fucking van!

746
00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:52,496
Go! Go, go, go!

747
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:00,296
Fuck!

748
00:56:11,818 --> 00:56:15,481
I thought I told you
you could get this at any clinic.

749
00:56:15,655 --> 00:56:20,115
And you should have had
your injection yesterday.

750
00:56:20,293 --> 00:56:22,557
You weren't on duty yesterday.

751
00:56:22,729 --> 00:56:26,859
Besides, when you find a good doctor,
you don't change, right?

752
00:56:27,033 --> 00:56:28,227
I'm not a doctor.

753
00:56:32,605 --> 00:56:34,505
The same thing. You don't change.

754
00:56:35,875 --> 00:56:36,899
Wife.

755
00:56:37,077 --> 00:56:39,978
Well, I don't have a ring.

756
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:42,671
No, but you did last week.

757
00:56:42,882 --> 00:56:45,248
Ah. So you noticed?

758
00:56:46,619 --> 00:56:48,086
Bad husband.

759
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:51,950
Ah! Yes. Ahem.
Yes, I was a bad husband.

760
00:56:52,125 --> 00:56:54,423
And she was an even worse wife...

761
00:56:54,594 --> 00:56:57,461
...which is why we're divorced now.

762
00:56:57,630 --> 00:56:58,654
It's over.

763
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:04,360
And now you're looking
for something else, huh?

764
00:57:05,071 --> 00:57:08,097
Something as different from her
as you can find.

765
00:57:08,274 --> 00:57:11,937
Something close to impossible.

766
00:57:12,112 --> 00:57:13,739
We're done.

767
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:16,171
Till next week.

768
00:57:24,157 --> 00:57:25,784
May I?

769
00:57:25,959 --> 00:57:28,154
Yes.

770
00:57:29,062 --> 00:57:31,553
I was wondering if maybe...

771
00:57:31,731 --> 00:57:35,667
...you wanted to have a conversation
sooner than next week.

772
00:57:35,835 --> 00:57:39,202
Maybe, <i>inshallah,</i> later this afternoon...

773
00:57:39,372 --> 00:57:41,567
...if that wouldn't make you
uncomfortable.

774
00:57:42,942 --> 00:57:47,038
Well, for you and me
to be able to do that...

775
00:57:47,213 --> 00:57:49,647
...first we would have
to have a conversation...

776
00:57:49,816 --> 00:57:52,580
...about the proper way
to have a conversation.

777
00:57:53,686 --> 00:57:55,677
Anyway, where I'm going
this afternoon...

778
00:57:55,855 --> 00:57:59,052
...would make you more uncomfortable
than me.

779
00:57:59,225 --> 00:58:02,217
Well, I doubt that.

780
00:58:02,395 --> 00:58:04,226
I don't.

781
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:35,352
WOMAN

782
00:58:42,001 --> 00:58:45,732
If you're trying to figure out how far I'll go
in order to express my interest...

783
00:58:45,905 --> 00:58:48,339
...I think you have the answer.

784
00:58:49,175 --> 00:58:51,405
- Do I?
- Mm.

785
00:58:51,578 --> 00:58:54,843
What else are you supposed to do
at this point? Leave here alone?

786
00:58:55,415 --> 00:58:58,350
You're safer with me and you know it.

787
00:58:58,518 --> 00:59:00,486
What are you asking?

788
00:59:00,653 --> 00:59:03,121
I'm asking what you do here.

789
00:59:03,823 --> 00:59:05,518
Well, I'm a political adviser.

790
00:59:06,859 --> 00:59:08,451
Who snowboards in Amman.

791
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:11,153
- That's right.
- Yeah, yeah.

792
00:59:11,331 --> 00:59:15,267
Listen, I have a thing to tell you,
an important one.

793
00:59:15,435 --> 00:59:18,768
A man is not his job.

794
00:59:18,938 --> 00:59:22,203
I mean, he's apart from his job. The man.

795
00:59:22,375 --> 00:59:24,206
I understand.

796
00:59:24,377 --> 00:59:27,369
No, I just want you
to know my feeling, my...

797
00:59:27,547 --> 00:59:30,380
My understanding of you.

798
00:59:30,550 --> 00:59:32,882
- Well, thank you.
- You're welcome.

799
00:59:42,295 --> 00:59:44,786
May I see you again, Aisha?

800
00:59:53,306 --> 00:59:55,672
When you wish
and with your permission, of course.

801
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:59,403
Where did you learn to speak Arabic
like this?

802
01:00:00,313 --> 01:00:02,907
Yeah, yeah, we are friends.

803
01:00:03,082 --> 01:00:04,344
We may talk again.

804
01:00:05,351 --> 01:00:07,012
We may.

805
01:00:07,186 --> 01:00:09,450
Well, thank you.

806
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:26,733
He's my friend.

807
01:00:28,675 --> 01:00:31,371
- It's fine. It's fine.
- You sure?

808
01:00:32,578 --> 01:00:33,909
It's fine.

809
01:00:35,581 --> 01:00:36,741
What's this all about?

810
01:02:07,073 --> 01:02:09,633
Marwan showed you the burning house?

811
01:02:10,543 --> 01:02:11,805
Do you know what happened?

812
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:14,344
I have absolutely no idea.

813
01:02:15,515 --> 01:02:19,417
You see, you could have said
to me yes or no. Simply that.

814
01:02:19,585 --> 01:02:23,749
When a man says to me more
than yes or no, then I begin to wonder.

815
01:02:23,923 --> 01:02:27,017
I don't know what happened, Hani.

816
01:02:29,495 --> 01:02:34,023
We had the advantage.
That house could have led us to Al-Saleem.

817
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:36,760
Now it is gone.
Everything inside it is gone.

818
01:02:36,936 --> 01:02:38,665
Here. Kneel.
- Hani, listen to me, I...

819
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:41,363
I told you never to lie to me.

820
01:02:41,541 --> 01:02:43,338
I am not lying to you, Hani.

821
01:02:43,509 --> 01:02:46,774
You did not know that this man,
after everything I said to you...

822
01:02:46,946 --> 01:02:50,109
...everything I said to Edward,
that he tried to take Karami?

823
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:53,682
He did not know.

824
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:56,083
When I want to speak with you,
I will look at you.

825
01:02:57,623 --> 01:02:59,090
Now I am talking to Mr. Ferris.

826
01:03:00,126 --> 01:03:02,959
So in as few words as possible...

827
01:03:03,596 --> 01:03:04,927
...did you know?

828
01:03:05,665 --> 01:03:07,428
No.

829
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:09,625
I don't believe you.

830
01:03:10,403 --> 01:03:12,735
You have 12 hours to leave Jordan.

831
01:03:12,905 --> 01:03:16,204
If I find you here,
I will not be responsible for your safety.

832
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:17,842
Do you understand me?

833
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:36,422
Now, you knew you needed
to adapt to this environment.

834
01:03:36,596 --> 01:03:39,087
Ferris, I know, but, you know, I...

835
01:03:46,439 --> 01:03:47,633
Ferris!

836
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:55,380
Ferris!

837
01:04:12,698 --> 01:04:16,190
Well, hey, buddy. Back from the sandbox?

838
01:04:16,369 --> 01:04:18,667
Enjoying civilization?
You wanna get a hot dog?

839
01:04:18,838 --> 01:04:22,205
How do you expect me to operate, Ed,
when you're keeping all the cards?

840
01:04:22,375 --> 01:04:25,208
- What about an ice cream?
- All Hani wanted was patience, Ed.

841
01:04:25,378 --> 01:04:28,040
- Patience. Not as a personal quality...
- I don't care.

842
01:04:28,214 --> 01:04:31,877
Not as a personal quality, but an operational
requirement, and you can't do it?

843
01:04:32,051 --> 01:04:35,509
You're too power hungry and greedy.
You fucked this whole operation up!

844
01:04:35,688 --> 01:04:38,020
For chrissakes,
I thought Hani wanted to kill me!

845
01:04:38,190 --> 01:04:39,350
Oh, don't exaggerate.

846
01:04:39,525 --> 01:04:43,188
Hani don't want to kill you.
He likes you. He likes you a lot.

847
01:04:43,362 --> 01:04:47,526
And who is he gonna get over there
better for him than you? Nobody.

848
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,026
Don't worry. You're gonna
be back in Jordan before you know it.

849
01:04:51,203 --> 01:04:53,364
Back with your Jordanian
piece of poontang...

850
01:04:53,539 --> 01:04:56,303
...that you think I don't know about,
but I do.

851
01:04:56,475 --> 01:04:59,171
You're a fat fucking piece of shit,
you know that, Ed?

852
01:04:59,345 --> 01:05:02,143
We do this shit for a living,
go on a diet, for chrissakes.

853
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:06,649
Are you quite finished?
Now, I did what I had to do.

854
01:05:07,853 --> 01:05:10,447
I ain't got time to play
Patience, <i>Sidi,</i> Patience...

855
01:05:10,623 --> 01:05:12,887
...and sit around eating couscous.

856
01:05:15,461 --> 01:05:19,056
Hani's interests extend only
to his own little fiefdom.

857
01:05:19,231 --> 01:05:20,664
Mine are global.

858
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:23,825
Now, having said that...

859
01:05:24,003 --> 01:05:29,305
...I admit that perhaps, possibly, I should
have, from an operational standpoint...

860
01:05:29,475 --> 01:05:31,670
...brought you into what I was doing.
- Exactly.

861
01:05:31,844 --> 01:05:35,211
What you should've done was listen
to what Hani said, and you know that.

862
01:05:38,784 --> 01:05:41,582
You know, 10 years ago,
I could've beat the crap out of you.

863
01:05:41,754 --> 01:05:44,018
Should've taken the shot
when you had the chance.

864
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:46,385
Maybe I should've. Can't do it now.

865
01:05:47,493 --> 01:05:51,020
What we need to do,
with or without the cooperation of Hani...

866
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:54,997
...is get our own man
inside Al-Saleem's tent.

867
01:05:56,268 --> 01:05:59,203
We could penetrate every goddamn
Salafi mosque in the world...

868
01:05:59,372 --> 01:06:01,602
...and still not even get close.

869
01:06:06,178 --> 01:06:08,738
- But Al-Saleem doesn't know that, right?
- What?

870
01:06:08,914 --> 01:06:12,907
He doesn't know that.
I mean, he doesn't know what we can't do.

871
01:06:13,085 --> 01:06:15,110
He doesn't know how close
or how far we are.

872
01:06:15,287 --> 01:06:17,187
He doesn't know what's true
or what isn't.

873
01:06:17,356 --> 01:06:21,224
I mean... Look, Osama fed Zarqawi
to the dogs...

874
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:23,487
...because he was getting
too powerful, right?

875
01:06:23,663 --> 01:06:25,961
- Right.
- What if instead of tracking Al-Saleem...

876
01:06:26,132 --> 01:06:29,260
...like we're doing right now
with absolutely no results...

877
01:06:29,435 --> 01:06:33,235
...we make it appear that there
is another terrorist operation out there...

878
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:35,101
...just as effective as his own?

879
01:06:35,274 --> 01:06:39,176
I mean, how would Al-Saleem react
to that kind of challenge to his stats?

880
01:06:39,345 --> 01:06:41,836
- What would he do?
- He would get paranoid.

881
01:06:42,014 --> 01:06:44,608
- He might rejoice. Maybe both.
- Exactly.

882
01:06:44,784 --> 01:06:47,548
But either way,
he'd try to get in contact with them, right?

883
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:50,245
- Right.
- Which would be us.

884
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:53,122
That would be us.

885
01:06:54,393 --> 01:06:57,419
You're a devious SOB.

886
01:06:57,596 --> 01:07:01,088
- We can't do this out of Langley.
- No. No, sir.

887
01:07:21,554 --> 01:07:24,614
Garland. Roger Ferris.
Pleased to meet you.

888
01:07:24,790 --> 01:07:26,189
Where's Hoffman?

889
01:07:26,358 --> 01:07:28,622
I don't know. Ben & Jerry's.

890
01:07:31,697 --> 01:07:33,722
He trusts you.

891
01:07:33,899 --> 01:07:38,768
I don't trust him. Every time we run
an operation and I don't see Hoffman...

892
01:07:38,938 --> 01:07:41,873
...it means he's running
another operation. Coffee?

893
01:07:42,041 --> 01:07:44,839
Yes, please. Black. Thank you.

894
01:07:45,711 --> 01:07:49,374
- Fruit? Strawberries, plums, apples?
- No, thanks.

895
01:07:50,750 --> 01:07:53,878
We're tracking a cell in Syria.
Last night, they were in Damascus.

896
01:07:54,053 --> 01:07:58,183
Today, Dayr Az-Zawr and the Iraqi border.

897
01:07:58,357 --> 01:08:01,554
But something tells me
they won't make it to Hasbaya.

898
01:08:01,727 --> 01:08:06,255
We have ninjas waiting.

899
01:08:06,432 --> 01:08:09,196
Who do these ninjas work for?

900
01:08:09,368 --> 01:08:10,801
Me.

901
01:08:10,970 --> 01:08:12,699
Shall we?

902
01:08:20,412 --> 01:08:23,609
So where is everyone?

903
01:08:23,783 --> 01:08:25,717
Absolutely no idea what you mean.

904
01:08:25,885 --> 01:08:31,551
- What? You mean it's just you?
- No. It's me and you.

905
01:08:31,724 --> 01:08:34,659
Did you think there'd be some
war room with lights flashing...

906
01:08:34,827 --> 01:08:36,226
...and people with clipboards?

907
01:08:36,395 --> 01:08:39,489
No, it's all here and here and here.
And here.

908
01:08:39,665 --> 01:08:42,361
Sure you won't have a strawberry?
They're really delicious.

909
01:08:42,535 --> 01:08:44,901
Yeah, no, I'm positive.

910
01:08:45,070 --> 01:08:49,200
Look, I'm gonna need some really, really
low-level al Qaeda contacts, all right?

911
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:53,175
No one too extreme. Picture somewhere
in between Osama and Oprah.

912
01:08:53,345 --> 01:08:54,471
You get my drift?

913
01:08:54,647 --> 01:08:57,912
I'm gonna need a security consultant,
a lawyer.

914
01:08:58,083 --> 01:09:01,211
I'm gonna need an Arab who travels
throughout the region, all right?

915
01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:05,756
A businessman. Someone who fits the role
of jihadist without actually being jihadist.

916
01:09:05,925 --> 01:09:07,085
A straw man.

917
01:09:08,494 --> 01:09:12,225
Receiving money, making plans.

918
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:14,298
That kind of thing.

919
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:17,125
Okay, no.

920
01:09:17,303 --> 01:09:19,032
No.

921
01:09:19,205 --> 01:09:20,433
No.

922
01:09:21,941 --> 01:09:24,603
Hang on. There you go.
Second from the top.

923
01:09:24,777 --> 01:09:27,644
Omar Sadiki. He's Jordanian.
He's an architect.

924
01:09:28,547 --> 01:09:32,449
Most of his commissions
are from charitable Islamic groups...

925
01:09:32,618 --> 01:09:34,483
...who then give money to the jihadists.

926
01:09:34,653 --> 01:09:37,121
So he ticks all the jihadist boxes...

927
01:09:37,289 --> 01:09:40,156
...except he's innocent.

928
01:09:40,326 --> 01:09:43,193
So he touches his head to the floor
five times a day.

929
01:09:43,362 --> 01:09:45,922
He believes in God.

930
01:09:46,098 --> 01:09:49,329
So why would he trade
with an infidel like myself?

931
01:09:51,337 --> 01:09:52,497
Money.

932
01:10:14,894 --> 01:10:17,124
Mr. Sadiki.

933
01:10:19,765 --> 01:10:21,392
Hello, Mr. Sadiki.

934
01:10:21,567 --> 01:10:24,866
Mr. Sadiki, it's Brad Scanlon
from Hayes Andover Bank.

935
01:10:25,037 --> 01:10:27,335
I'm following up on my email.

936
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:28,964
Yeah.

937
01:10:29,141 --> 01:10:31,974
Yeah, well, listen,
I got into Dubai a little bit early.

938
01:10:32,144 --> 01:10:38,105
I'm staying at the Jumeirah Emirates
Towers, but I can meet you anywhere.

939
01:10:38,284 --> 01:10:39,979
Well, fantastic.

940
01:10:47,359 --> 01:10:48,792
Anything else to know?

941
01:10:48,961 --> 01:10:50,553
Exactly as we discussed.

942
01:10:50,996 --> 01:10:52,020
I'm cool with that.

943
01:10:52,197 --> 01:10:54,665
- I'm used to knowing nothing.
- I'm sure you are, Tony.

944
01:10:54,833 --> 01:10:57,427
- Just get in position.
- Okay, boss.

945
01:10:59,571 --> 01:11:01,368
Mr. Sadiki.
- Yeah.

946
01:11:01,540 --> 01:11:06,409
Hayes Andover's option to buy this property
is gonna expire by the end of the month.

947
01:11:06,578 --> 01:11:08,739
We're hoping to get some sketches
and a bid...

948
01:11:08,914 --> 01:11:11,610
...by, say, next Thursday
before the Islamic weekend.

949
01:11:11,784 --> 01:11:13,718
Well, I think...

950
01:11:13,886 --> 01:11:15,251
- Yes, certainly.
- Hm.

951
01:11:15,421 --> 01:11:18,390
You'll also have to sign a letter of intent
with Mr. Al-Masri...

952
01:11:18,557 --> 01:11:20,115
...if that's okay with you.

953
01:11:20,292 --> 01:11:21,884
- Makes no difference to me.
- Great.

954
01:11:22,061 --> 01:11:26,896
- Allah will decide if I get the job or not.
- Fantastic.

955
01:11:27,066 --> 01:11:28,863
Mr. Al-Masri?

956
01:11:29,401 --> 01:11:30,425
Mr. Omar Sadiki.

957
01:11:37,076 --> 01:11:39,636
- Would anyone like some coffee?
- Yes, please. Thank you.

958
01:11:39,812 --> 01:11:43,145
<i>Ed, Al-Masri</i>
<i>is a lawyer we found with al Qaeda ties.</i>

959
01:11:43,315 --> 01:11:46,216
<i>He's fairly low on the map,</i>
<i>but he is on the map...</i>

960
01:11:46,385 --> 01:11:50,014
<i>... enough for a photograph</i>
<i>to suggest Sadiki's guilt by association.</i>

961
01:11:50,189 --> 01:11:52,384
Mm-hm. You have his computer?

962
01:11:53,125 --> 01:11:55,184
Yeah, look,
I'm gonna go get it right now.

963
01:11:55,361 --> 01:11:58,057
He's going to the Cyclone Club.
He loves the Russian girls.

964
01:11:58,230 --> 01:12:00,790
I'll call you soon. Call you soon.

965
01:12:02,067 --> 01:12:03,728
Three-sixteen.

966
01:12:46,912 --> 01:12:47,970
Come on, baby.

967
01:12:53,886 --> 01:12:55,217
- Garland?
- Yeah?

968
01:12:55,387 --> 01:12:57,150
<i>Stand by. All right?</i>

969
01:12:58,490 --> 01:13:01,152
Just getting in right now.

970
01:13:11,236 --> 01:13:14,228
Ah. This is useful.

971
01:13:14,907 --> 01:13:17,068
Very useful.

972
01:13:17,242 --> 01:13:22,111
I have an e-mail list of the members
of the Brothers of Awareness.

973
01:13:22,281 --> 01:13:24,340
<i>The Brothers of who-the-fuck?</i>

974
01:13:24,516 --> 01:13:28,179
The Ikhwan Ishfan. They're just a study
group of believers at his local mosque.

975
01:13:28,353 --> 01:13:30,321
But I can make it look like anything.

976
01:13:30,489 --> 01:13:33,686
All right. Let's make it look
like everything, huh?

977
01:13:41,533 --> 01:13:45,162
Now, make fake accounts
for half a dozen of the brothers...

978
01:13:45,337 --> 01:13:49,205
<i>... and start transferring money to them</i>
<i>from Sadiki's fake receiver account.</i>

979
01:13:49,374 --> 01:13:51,274
<i>Just small operational sums.</i>

980
01:13:51,443 --> 01:13:52,740
Okay.

981
01:13:56,415 --> 01:14:00,078
The Saudis will pick up the money moving,
and everything they pick up...

982
01:14:00,252 --> 01:14:02,686
They'll leak to the jihadists.

983
01:14:02,855 --> 01:14:06,621
- <i>You got it, my friend.</i>
- It's coming up. Now it's done.

984
01:14:44,496 --> 01:14:46,293
Dad! Dad!

985
01:14:47,166 --> 01:14:49,464
Hey, baby. Hold on. Oh.

986
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:54,470
<i>Hey, Ed, you there?</i>
- Where are you?

987
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:57,006
Dubai International. I'm on my way back.

988
01:14:57,176 --> 01:15:00,077
No, no, no. No, you're not.
You're going back to Amman.

989
01:15:00,646 --> 01:15:03,342
- Hani called, asked where you were.
- Jesus Christ.

990
01:15:03,515 --> 01:15:06,541
If you don't go back,
he's gonna wonder why you didn't go back.

991
01:15:06,718 --> 01:15:08,913
I think he likes you, buddy.
Change your ticket.

992
01:15:09,087 --> 01:15:12,056
- All right, Ed. I'm on my way.
- All right.

993
01:15:12,224 --> 01:15:14,988
- Oh, hey. Can I get that for you?
- Thank you.

994
01:15:22,534 --> 01:15:25,094
Mr. Ferris. Welcome.

995
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:27,431
- Thank you.
- Come.

996
01:15:38,617 --> 01:15:43,554
I wanted to see you to tell you
I was sorry how we left things.

997
01:15:44,022 --> 01:15:47,480
- I was upset.
- Well, you had every right to be upset, sir.

998
01:15:47,659 --> 01:15:49,490
I apologize for what happened.

999
01:15:50,529 --> 01:15:52,588
But I am happy you are back.

1000
01:15:53,398 --> 01:15:55,866
Miss Aisha, too, I think,
will be happy you are back.

1001
01:15:56,735 --> 01:16:01,001
Don't worry, we're not watching you.
We're watching out for you.

1002
01:16:01,740 --> 01:16:05,369
But I need you to understand, you
cannot afford any more mistakes in Jordan.

1003
01:16:06,411 --> 01:16:09,642
This is a part of the world
where friendship matters.

1004
01:16:10,449 --> 01:16:12,383
It can save your life.

1005
01:16:12,584 --> 01:16:16,486
Why don't I call you back in about
15 minutes with all the information?

1006
01:16:16,655 --> 01:16:18,919
Well, thanks so much, Mr. Sadiki.

1007
01:16:20,025 --> 01:16:21,890
Let's get something clear, all right?

1008
01:16:22,060 --> 01:16:24,187
I'm not tolerating any more
of your bullshit.

1009
01:16:24,363 --> 01:16:26,388
- No, it's cool.
- Who do you work for?

1010
01:16:26,565 --> 01:16:29,659
- I work for you. I got the call, I got briefed.
- All right, good.

1011
01:16:29,835 --> 01:16:32,429
- Front? Back?
- Take my bag.

1012
01:16:43,715 --> 01:16:48,345
If you're going to insist on coming here
to see me...

1013
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:50,954
...which is what you're doing...

1014
01:16:51,123 --> 01:16:54,718
...my sister's going to want to meet you.

1015
01:16:56,395 --> 01:16:57,953
Your sister?

1016
01:16:58,130 --> 01:17:02,794
Yeah, my sister looks after me
in matters that are non-medical.

1017
01:17:04,903 --> 01:17:09,203
Oh, so she has to approve of me
before you will begin to.

1018
01:17:10,509 --> 01:17:14,206
I would like her to think so,
whenever I can.

1019
01:17:16,381 --> 01:17:17,405
Okay.

1020
01:17:52,383 --> 01:17:54,078
- Hi.
- Hi.

1021
01:17:54,252 --> 01:17:55,583
I'm still cooking.

1022
01:17:55,753 --> 01:17:58,449
- Come in.
- I brought some dessert, pastry.

1023
01:17:58,623 --> 01:18:00,784
Oh, the kids are going to love it.

1024
01:18:00,958 --> 01:18:02,084
- The kids?
- Yeah.

1025
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:04,785
- Aha.
- Come.

1026
01:18:07,165 --> 01:18:10,396
This is my sister, Cala.

1027
01:18:12,070 --> 01:18:13,094
Mr. Ferris.

1028
01:18:14,539 --> 01:18:18,873
And these are my nephews,
Yousef and Rowley.

1029
01:18:19,043 --> 01:18:20,567
Hello.

1030
01:18:20,745 --> 01:18:22,303
Yousef. Rowley. Hey.

1031
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:23,879
Hi.
- Hi.

1032
01:18:24,048 --> 01:18:26,608
- Nephews.
- Yeah, my nephews.

1033
01:18:32,757 --> 01:18:35,021
Smells good in there, huh?

1034
01:18:35,193 --> 01:18:37,218
It's not good.

1035
01:18:40,131 --> 01:18:41,496
It's not good?

1036
01:18:41,666 --> 01:18:44,635
- You don't like your mother's cooking?
- No, not really.

1037
01:18:44,969 --> 01:18:45,993
Oh.

1038
01:18:52,343 --> 01:18:54,470
What kind of food do you like?

1039
01:18:54,645 --> 01:18:56,135
Hamburgers.

1040
01:18:56,314 --> 01:18:58,544
- You?
- Spaghettis.

1041
01:18:58,716 --> 01:19:00,411
Me too.

1042
01:19:00,585 --> 01:19:04,715
So if there's anything that I wouldn't like,
would you two let me know?

1043
01:19:06,624 --> 01:19:07,886
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1044
01:19:08,059 --> 01:19:09,117
Cool.

1045
01:19:22,406 --> 01:19:25,603
So, Mr. Ferris...

1046
01:19:26,144 --> 01:19:28,271
...how long are you in Amman?

1047
01:19:29,046 --> 01:19:30,104
Oh, uh, ahem.

1048
01:19:30,281 --> 01:19:34,240
Well, I think I'm gonna be for a while.
I hope so, anyway.

1049
01:19:36,954 --> 01:19:39,184
Where were you stationed before?

1050
01:19:40,625 --> 01:19:41,683
Riyadh.

1051
01:19:42,727 --> 01:19:43,921
- Riyadh?
- Hm.

1052
01:19:48,599 --> 01:19:50,999
What do you do exactly?

1053
01:19:51,235 --> 01:19:55,296
I told you, Cala, he's a political adviser.

1054
01:19:55,473 --> 01:19:57,532
Political adviser.

1055
01:19:57,708 --> 01:20:00,905
But what does that mean?
Forgive my ignorance.

1056
01:20:01,078 --> 01:20:03,842
- It means, uh...
- It means that I...

1057
01:20:04,015 --> 01:20:08,748
Well, I offer my assistance to
His Majesty's advisers whenever they ask.

1058
01:20:14,625 --> 01:20:17,594
But you do this now, not before the war.

1059
01:20:17,762 --> 01:20:20,595
Before you didn't consult with us at all.

1060
01:20:20,765 --> 01:20:24,030
- Cala, please, we are just having lunch.
- It's okay.

1061
01:20:24,202 --> 01:20:25,567
- It's okay.
- We can talk...

1062
01:20:25,736 --> 01:20:28,603
- I'm talking with your friend.
- Talk about another subject.

1063
01:20:28,773 --> 01:20:30,536
It's quite all right. I understand.

1064
01:20:30,708 --> 01:20:34,041
And we understand
that the situation in Iraq...

1065
01:20:34,212 --> 01:20:38,308
...has created many hardships
for the Jordanian people.

1066
01:20:38,983 --> 01:20:40,974
- The situation?
- You mean, the war.

1067
01:20:41,152 --> 01:20:43,643
- He means war.
- No, no, no, he says the situation.

1068
01:20:43,821 --> 01:20:45,516
- What do you mean?
- You know what...

1069
01:20:45,690 --> 01:20:46,952
Please.

1070
01:20:47,124 --> 01:20:51,060
I mean the roadside bombings,
the assassination of Iraqi police...

1071
01:20:51,229 --> 01:20:53,697
...the kidnappings,
the crowded marketplaces...

1072
01:20:53,864 --> 01:20:57,231
...and innocent families that have
been wiped off the face of the Earth.

1073
01:20:57,401 --> 01:20:59,733
That's what I mean
by the situation in Iraq.

1074
01:21:03,774 --> 01:21:06,607
I can tell you what
His Majesty's thinking.

1075
01:21:07,745 --> 01:21:11,203
His Majesty believes the best hope
for the war is that it ends.

1076
01:21:11,782 --> 01:21:14,273
Well, I can tell you
that is my hope as well.

1077
01:21:14,952 --> 01:21:16,943
I hope so too. Huh?

1078
01:21:17,121 --> 01:21:21,057
Cala? Hey. Peace.

1079
01:21:21,225 --> 01:21:23,921
- Let's have lunch, huh?
- Okay.

1080
01:21:24,095 --> 01:21:25,619
Enjoy.

1081
01:21:25,796 --> 01:21:27,354
Thank you.

1082
01:21:30,568 --> 01:21:33,059
- Well, sorry about that.
- Ah, so am I.

1083
01:21:33,237 --> 01:21:36,900
I probably should've kept my mouth shut.
After all, I was a guest in your home.

1084
01:21:37,074 --> 01:21:39,304
So is she. It didn't stop her, you know?

1085
01:21:39,477 --> 01:21:42,810
She suffered a lot during Iran-Iraq war.

1086
01:21:42,980 --> 01:21:47,007
And the funny thing
is that she wants to live in America.

1087
01:21:47,184 --> 01:21:48,242
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1088
01:21:48,419 --> 01:21:51,752
Well, tell her I'll switch passports with her.
It'll make us both happy.

1089
01:21:51,922 --> 01:21:53,822
Don't joke about these kind of things.

1090
01:21:53,991 --> 01:21:58,758
I'm not joking. I'm perfectly serious.
I may stay here forever. Really.

1091
01:22:00,398 --> 01:22:03,663
Well, anyway, I'm glad I made friends
with her boys. I like them a lot.

1092
01:22:03,834 --> 01:22:05,665
Yeah, they're great, aren't they?

1093
01:22:05,836 --> 01:22:09,067
But not very good spies, you know?
Neither are you.

1094
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:10,264
What do you mean?

1095
01:22:10,441 --> 01:22:11,908
- At the table, you know?
- Oh.

1096
01:22:12,677 --> 01:22:15,510
So you noticed. All right. I'm busted.

1097
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:18,672
Well, thank you, Aisha,
for inviting me in your home.

1098
01:22:19,350 --> 01:22:20,442
Um...

1099
01:22:26,223 --> 01:22:27,884
Sorry.

1100
01:22:28,693 --> 01:22:30,888
- I had a really nice time.
- Sorry. Yeah, me too.

1101
01:22:31,762 --> 01:22:34,959
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you.

1102
01:22:45,076 --> 01:22:49,274
The photograph was taken last week
in the Cyclone Club in Dubai.

1103
01:22:49,447 --> 01:22:51,039
One is Al-Masri, a lawyer...

1104
01:22:51,215 --> 01:22:56,152
...a low-level al Qaeda financier,
if that's not a contradiction in terms.

1105
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:58,754
The other is a Jordanian.

1106
01:22:58,923 --> 01:23:01,619
An architect named Omar Sadiki.

1107
01:23:02,893 --> 01:23:04,588
No known terrorist ties.

1108
01:23:04,762 --> 01:23:10,632
Now, the question I ask myself is,
is what are they doing together?

1109
01:23:15,506 --> 01:23:18,498
Is this Sadiki more than he claims to be?

1110
01:23:19,110 --> 01:23:20,270
He travels a lot.

1111
01:23:20,711 --> 01:23:23,646
He builds mosques and shopping malls.

1112
01:23:23,814 --> 01:23:26,749
At the very least,
he bears examination by us.

1113
01:23:26,917 --> 01:23:28,908
Or by we.

1114
01:23:29,353 --> 01:23:30,786
Hm.

1115
01:23:32,423 --> 01:23:33,685
Where'd you get these?

1116
01:23:34,692 --> 01:23:36,956
- A friend in Saudi Intelligence.
- Mm.

1117
01:23:37,661 --> 01:23:39,094
Useful friend, huh?

1118
01:23:48,272 --> 01:23:49,705
No, keep it.

1119
01:23:50,374 --> 01:23:52,433
I want you to have it.

1120
01:23:52,610 --> 01:23:55,977
We are partners. Allies, no?

1121
01:23:57,014 --> 01:23:59,847
Why would we not want
to help each other?

1122
01:24:00,017 --> 01:24:03,111
Right. Thank you.

1123
01:24:03,587 --> 01:24:05,350
<i>Garland.</i>
<i>- Yeah?</i>

1124
01:24:05,523 --> 01:24:08,583
<i>Pull up an Arabic keyboard</i>
<i>and write down this message, you ready?</i>

1125
01:24:08,759 --> 01:24:09,783
Okay.

1126
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:12,428
In the name of Go...
No, you know what, strike that.

1127
01:24:12,596 --> 01:24:14,996
In the name of God the merciful...

1128
01:24:15,166 --> 01:24:17,657
<i>... we praise our brothers</i>
<i>who shall carry out...</i>

1129
01:24:17,835 --> 01:24:20,201
<i>... this heroic act in the fig orchard...</i>

1130
01:24:20,371 --> 01:24:23,465
...and beg God to give us strength
for our continuing struggle.

1131
01:24:23,641 --> 01:24:25,871
The time is at hand. All right?

1132
01:24:26,043 --> 01:24:30,002
Now, that's absolutely delightful Arabic,
but what the fuck is the fig orchard?

1133
01:24:30,181 --> 01:24:33,150
<i>I can't let you in on that yet.</i>
<i>Let's just say it's developing.</i>

1134
01:24:33,317 --> 01:24:34,511
It'll create chatter...

1135
01:24:34,685 --> 01:24:38,143
...but it's gotta be big enough
for Al-Saleem, to get his attention.

1136
01:24:38,589 --> 01:24:39,749
Oh, it'll be big.

1137
01:24:39,924 --> 01:24:42,757
Now, send that off
from Sadiki's fake e-mail address...

1138
01:24:42,927 --> 01:24:44,588
<i>... and we are in business.</i>

1139
01:24:44,762 --> 01:24:46,024
Okay. Done.

1140
01:24:59,610 --> 01:25:01,737
<i>Advise when you're on the deck.</i>

1141
01:25:12,723 --> 01:25:15,692
<i>Hello there, Mr. Sadiki.</i>
<i>It's Brad Scanlon.</i>

1142
01:25:15,860 --> 01:25:19,523
I'm fine. Thanks so much for asking.
But we've got a bit of a problem.

1143
01:25:19,697 --> 01:25:22,495
You see, our chief engineer,
who's based out of Ankara...

1144
01:25:22,666 --> 01:25:26,227
...he's raised some issues
about the insulation.

1145
01:25:26,403 --> 01:25:29,201
I realize it's the same stuff
that you use in Saudi Arabia...

1146
01:25:29,373 --> 01:25:32,934
...but he's asked
to meet with you immediately.

1147
01:25:33,110 --> 01:25:36,045
No, I'm sorry, sir.
He cannot fly up to see you.

1148
01:25:36,213 --> 01:25:39,410
And the only time he can meet
is tomorrow afternoon.

1149
01:25:39,583 --> 01:25:43,485
But the good news is, we have a car
ready to pick you up in about...

1150
01:25:43,654 --> 01:25:48,318
...oh, six hours, and a plane ticket to Turkey
waiting for you at the airport.

1151
01:25:49,126 --> 01:25:52,095
No, I'm sorry, sir.
First class was not available.

1152
01:25:53,197 --> 01:25:55,392
<i>Ed, Sadiki just landed in Turkey.</i>

1153
01:25:55,566 --> 01:25:57,397
<i>He's being met by one of our guys.</i>

1154
01:25:57,568 --> 01:26:01,095
<i>An engineer to discuss business</i>
<i>and to show him a good time.</i>

1155
01:26:01,272 --> 01:26:03,706
<i>All we need is to establish</i>
<i>that he is there.</i>

1156
01:26:03,908 --> 01:26:05,899
- Mm-hm.
- <i>Now, the barracks at the base...</i>

1157
01:26:06,076 --> 01:26:08,044
<i>... have been cleared out of all personnel.</i>

1158
01:26:08,212 --> 01:26:10,305
<i>Bodies from the morgue</i>
<i>have been brought in.</i>

1159
01:26:10,481 --> 01:26:13,382
<i>They'll be our so-called casualties.</i>

1160
01:26:13,551 --> 01:26:17,920
<i>Now, Garland will send out a message</i>
<i>from Sadiki hinting that a strike is prepared.</i>

1161
01:26:18,088 --> 01:26:19,487
And when the strike is done...

1162
01:26:19,657 --> 01:26:23,252
...he'll post another message taking
responsibility for our little event.

1163
01:26:23,427 --> 01:26:25,395
- You got that?
- Uh-huh.

1164
01:26:25,563 --> 01:26:26,825
<i>After that...</i>

1165
01:26:26,997 --> 01:26:30,694
...hopefully a buzz of messages
will then pass among jihadists' networks...

1166
01:26:30,868 --> 01:26:34,964
<i>... announcing the Brothers of Awareness</i>
<i>as a new player.</i>

1167
01:26:35,139 --> 01:26:37,801
And our Sadiki as its leader.
You got that?

1168
01:26:37,975 --> 01:26:39,636
<i>All right, Ferris. Thank you.</i>

1169
01:26:39,810 --> 01:26:41,175
<i>Tony, you have a go.</i>

1170
01:26:48,619 --> 01:26:50,382
<i>We have a special report.</i>

1171
01:26:50,554 --> 01:26:53,614
<i>A massive explosion</i>
<i>has taken place in Incirlik, Turkey.</i>

1172
01:26:53,791 --> 01:26:56,919
<i>Officials have confirmed the</i>
<i>target of the blast to be the U.S. Air Base...</i>

1173
01:26:58,295 --> 01:27:01,992
<i>... at Incirlik, Turkey. The bomb ripped</i>
<i>through the Bachelor Officers' Quarters...</i>

1174
01:27:02,166 --> 01:27:04,327
<i>... at 3:00 this morning,</i>
<i>quickly engulfing it in flames.</i>

1175
01:27:05,869 --> 01:27:08,497
<i>No one yet has claimed responsibility</i>
<i>for the attack.</i>

1176
01:27:08,672 --> 01:27:12,369
<i>But terror experts are already speculating</i>
<i>this is the work of a new...</i>

1177
01:27:12,543 --> 01:27:16,138
<i>... much more sophisticated and much</i>
<i>better financed offshoot of al Qaeda...</i>

1178
01:27:16,313 --> 01:27:18,747
<i>... than that which is responsible</i>
<i>for the bombings...</i>

1179
01:27:18,916 --> 01:27:21,680
<i>... in Amsterdam, London</i>
<i>and other European cities.</i>

1180
01:27:21,852 --> 01:27:23,683
<i>In contrast to these recent bombings...</i>

1181
01:27:23,854 --> 01:27:27,312
<i>... this is the first attack</i>
<i>to occur on American property.</i>

1182
01:27:27,491 --> 01:27:28,753
- <i>The Pentagon...</i>
- Honey.

1183
01:27:28,926 --> 01:27:32,453
<i>... will not release the names of the dead</i>
<i>until notification of next of kin.</i>

1184
01:27:32,630 --> 01:27:35,360
<i>We're also being told that there</i>
<i>may never be a public announcement...</i>

1185
01:27:35,532 --> 01:27:36,556
Honey.

1186
01:27:36,734 --> 01:27:38,861
<i>... of the list of casualties</i>
<i>since some of the men killed...</i>

1187
01:27:39,036 --> 01:27:41,903
<i>... may have been stationed at Incirlik</i>
<i>on classified missions.</i>

1188
01:27:42,072 --> 01:27:45,940
<i>Incirlik, which in Turkish means fig orchard,</i>
<i>has served since September the 11 th...</i>

1189
01:27:46,110 --> 01:27:49,568
<i>... as a primary hub in the wars</i>
<i>in Afghanistan and Iraq.</i>

1190
01:27:49,747 --> 01:27:53,205
All right, now send out the message
taking credit.

1191
01:27:53,384 --> 01:27:57,081
But make the responses go back
to Sadiki's actual account.

1192
01:27:57,254 --> 01:27:59,745
- <i>You got that?</i>
- Okay.

1193
01:28:04,728 --> 01:28:09,358
I can't say it's been real,
but you know what I mean.

1194
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,058
Yeah.

1195
01:28:27,818 --> 01:28:31,777
AL-SALEEM

1196
01:29:03,218 --> 01:29:05,345
SADIKI:

1197
01:31:45,247 --> 01:31:46,942
<i>Hey there, little buddy.</i>

1198
01:31:47,482 --> 01:31:51,248
<i>Well done. You did it.</i>
<i>NSA 's picking up all kinds of chatter.</i>

1199
01:31:51,420 --> 01:31:52,580
<i>Haven't heard for years.</i>

1200
01:31:52,754 --> 01:31:56,713
One voice on a world phone out of Vienna
sounds a lot like Al-Saleem himself.

1201
01:31:56,892 --> 01:32:00,419
<i>Saying something along the lines of,</i>
<i>"Who the damn heck is Omar Sadiki?"</i>

1202
01:32:00,595 --> 01:32:04,759
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Listen,
I made a decision, Ed. I'm bringing him in.

1203
01:32:04,933 --> 01:32:07,595
- <i>Who?</i>
- Omar Sadiki, that's who.

1204
01:32:07,769 --> 01:32:09,327
Oh, come on. No, no, no.

1205
01:32:09,504 --> 01:32:13,133
When they find him, they are gonna
torture him and they are gonna kill him.

1206
01:32:13,308 --> 01:32:17,005
You gotta decide which side of the cross
you're on. I need nailers, not hangers.

1207
01:32:17,179 --> 01:32:19,511
Decision's already done, Ed.
I'm bringing him in.

1208
01:32:19,681 --> 01:32:22,650
Ain't nobody innocent
in this shit, Ferris. Okay?

1209
01:32:23,885 --> 01:32:24,909
Ferris.

1210
01:32:25,754 --> 01:32:28,552
All right, don't move until I say, all right?

1211
01:32:34,329 --> 01:32:35,796
<i>You got me?</i>

1212
01:32:42,504 --> 01:32:43,994
Omar.

1213
01:32:44,172 --> 01:32:46,936
It's Brad Scanlon.
We need to have a conversation. Come on.

1214
01:32:47,109 --> 01:32:49,009
What are you doing here?

1215
01:32:54,216 --> 01:32:57,276
Fuck! Omar! Omar, open the door!

1216
01:32:57,452 --> 01:32:58,510
Let's go!

1217
01:32:58,687 --> 01:33:01,053
Omar, listen to me!

1218
01:33:01,223 --> 01:33:02,815
Omar! Omar!

1219
01:33:03,492 --> 01:33:05,722
Let's go! Go, go, go!

1220
01:33:18,473 --> 01:33:19,963
Fuck!

1221
01:33:27,516 --> 01:33:30,383
This is Roger Ferris. I need an ambulance.

1222
01:34:40,589 --> 01:34:42,580
LIEUTENANT:

1223
01:35:31,907 --> 01:35:33,670
Yeah.

1224
01:35:33,842 --> 01:35:35,969
<i>Sadiki is dead.</i>

1225
01:35:36,945 --> 01:35:38,606
<i>You there?</i>

1226
01:35:38,780 --> 01:35:40,145
Yeah, I'm here.

1227
01:35:40,315 --> 01:35:42,215
I didn't kill him, buddy.

1228
01:35:42,384 --> 01:35:43,544
<i>I know you didn't, Ed.</i>

1229
01:35:45,220 --> 01:35:46,744
I did.

1230
01:35:46,922 --> 01:35:50,517
Oh, buddy.
Buddy, that's just not constructive. Okay?

1231
01:35:50,692 --> 01:35:53,627
- Then what is?
- Doing exactly what you're doing.

1232
01:35:53,795 --> 01:35:57,561
And how are you measuring that? By how
much closer you've gotten to Al-Saleem?

1233
01:35:57,732 --> 01:36:00,997
I bet you heard a shitload of chatter,
then it stopped, didn't it?

1234
01:36:01,169 --> 01:36:02,466
That's right.

1235
01:36:02,637 --> 01:36:04,628
<i>Well, then where is Al-Saleem?</i>

1236
01:36:05,540 --> 01:36:08,008
- Hm?
- Ferris.

1237
01:36:08,710 --> 01:36:11,042
You know what? I've had it.

1238
01:36:11,212 --> 01:36:13,146
I've had it. I can't do this anymore.

1239
01:36:13,915 --> 01:36:14,939
Yes, you can.

1240
01:36:15,116 --> 01:36:17,744
Now, you just get yourself
a couple of hours' sleep.

1241
01:36:17,919 --> 01:36:19,819
And call me
when you're thinking straight.

1242
01:36:19,988 --> 01:36:23,924
You know what? I am thinking straight.
You're not, all right?

1243
01:36:24,092 --> 01:36:26,822
You can't, because you're
a million fucking miles away.

1244
01:36:26,995 --> 01:36:28,462
I'm here, Ed, every day.

1245
01:36:28,630 --> 01:36:30,962
And I see the unnecessary travesties
of this war...

1246
01:36:31,132 --> 01:36:34,568
<i>... that the rest of you backstabbing</i>
<i>political fucking bureaucrats...</i>

1247
01:36:34,736 --> 01:36:36,033
<i>... only look at pictures of.</i>

1248
01:36:36,204 --> 01:36:39,503
So don't you dare tell me
I am not fucking thinking straight!

1249
01:36:41,610 --> 01:36:43,271
This is not working, all right?

1250
01:36:43,445 --> 01:36:45,504
<i>It's not working. I'm out.</i>

1251
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:47,671
Ferris?

1252
01:36:47,849 --> 01:36:49,840
Ferris?

1253
01:36:53,121 --> 01:36:55,146
I should pack.

1254
01:37:13,675 --> 01:37:15,734
Fuck.

1255
01:37:21,282 --> 01:37:22,874
Fuck!

1256
01:37:42,237 --> 01:37:43,795
Shit!

1257
01:37:44,472 --> 01:37:46,463
Move the fucking car!

1258
01:38:54,175 --> 01:38:55,904
- Where's Marwan? Marwan?
- Mr. Ferris.

1259
01:38:56,077 --> 01:38:57,635
Please.

1260
01:38:59,080 --> 01:39:01,844
Please, please.
I just need a moment of his time, all right?

1261
01:39:02,016 --> 01:39:03,813
Okay.

1262
01:39:09,524 --> 01:39:11,048
Please?

1263
01:39:12,794 --> 01:39:14,728
Please excuse me.

1264
01:39:21,603 --> 01:39:23,366
What is it?

1265
01:39:29,644 --> 01:39:32,670
I invented Omar Sadiki.

1266
01:39:32,847 --> 01:39:36,010
It was my operation.
He is not a jihadist, all right?

1267
01:39:36,184 --> 01:39:40,280
I moved him around, I moved money around,
and then I lost him.

1268
01:39:40,455 --> 01:39:42,855
- That is impossible.
- Why?

1269
01:39:43,024 --> 01:39:47,085
Because it will mean that you sat
in my office and you lied to my face.

1270
01:39:47,262 --> 01:39:51,062
Hani, I promise I will share
all the information with you, all right?

1271
01:39:51,232 --> 01:39:54,565
But they have kidnapped a friend of mine
in order to get to me.

1272
01:39:54,736 --> 01:39:57,136
Now, you know exactly
who I'm talking about, Hani.

1273
01:39:57,305 --> 01:40:00,741
Please, they're gonna execute her,
all right?

1274
01:40:00,909 --> 01:40:03,377
Please, help me broker a deal, her for me.

1275
01:40:03,545 --> 01:40:05,513
You lied to me.

1276
01:40:05,680 --> 01:40:07,147
I will not help you.

1277
01:40:07,315 --> 01:40:09,613
- The answer is no.
- Please, Hani.

1278
01:40:09,784 --> 01:40:12,252
Hani. Hani!

1279
01:40:30,905 --> 01:40:32,338
Ed.

1280
01:40:32,507 --> 01:40:35,476
You should've told me about the girl.
We could've watched her.

1281
01:40:35,643 --> 01:40:37,543
They left the phone.
I know how this goes.

1282
01:40:37,712 --> 01:40:39,839
They've got Aisha
and they want someone.

1283
01:40:40,014 --> 01:40:43,780
- If she's alive.
- She has to be alive, right?

1284
01:40:44,252 --> 01:40:47,346
Well, she's probably alive.
At least, they want you to think so.

1285
01:40:47,522 --> 01:40:49,717
- That's the good part.
- And what's the bad part?

1286
01:40:49,891 --> 01:40:51,358
They know about you.

1287
01:40:51,526 --> 01:40:54,654
They know you work for the agency.
That tells me two things.

1288
01:40:54,829 --> 01:40:57,354
One, the people that have Aisha
are running the show...

1289
01:40:57,532 --> 01:40:59,056
...so they're close to Al-Saleem.

1290
01:40:59,234 --> 01:41:02,294
Two, they have learned enough
from Aisha to know she's your pal.

1291
01:41:02,470 --> 01:41:04,438
- She's been interrogated.
- Goddamn it.

1292
01:41:04,606 --> 01:41:07,006
- You cannot take this to Hani, right?
- Right. Right.

1293
01:41:07,175 --> 01:41:10,770
- Does that mean you already have?
- Yes. Yes, sir, I have.

1294
01:41:10,945 --> 01:41:11,969
Why would you do that?

1295
01:41:12,146 --> 01:41:14,046
I have to trust everyone I can right now.

1296
01:41:14,215 --> 01:41:16,615
All you gotta do is trust me.

1297
01:41:17,151 --> 01:41:18,584
- What'd he say?
- He said, <i>"Ma'alesh."</i>

1298
01:41:18,753 --> 01:41:20,721
Because I lied to him,
he's not gonna help.

1299
01:41:28,596 --> 01:41:30,996
Okay. We set this up,
we're gonna do it right.

1300
01:41:31,165 --> 01:41:34,225
- It's not just about you and your girlfriend.
- All right.

1301
01:41:36,504 --> 01:41:40,304
This is Roger Ferris.
Will you put Aisha on the phone?

1302
01:41:40,475 --> 01:41:43,308
<i>Okay, mister. Thanks God you are calling.</i>

1303
01:41:43,478 --> 01:41:46,811
<i>I have a question</i>
<i>to make sure you are you. Please.</i>

1304
01:41:46,981 --> 01:41:48,005
Fine.

1305
01:41:48,182 --> 01:41:50,412
<i>Where do you meet Miss Aisha first time?</i>

1306
01:41:50,585 --> 01:41:55,181
<i>At a medical clinic in Amman.</i>
<i>She's a nurse.</i>

1307
01:41:55,356 --> 01:41:58,291
<i>Where do you take Miss Aisha</i>
<i>for dinner first time?</i>

1308
01:41:58,459 --> 01:42:00,256
Go, go.

1309
01:42:00,461 --> 01:42:01,792
Uh...

1310
01:42:01,963 --> 01:42:05,899
I didn't. She invited me
to her apartment for dinner.

1311
01:42:06,067 --> 01:42:07,557
<i>Did you bring anything?</i>

1312
01:42:09,304 --> 01:42:11,033
<i>I did.</i>

1313
01:42:11,839 --> 01:42:14,603
A dessert pastry.

1314
01:42:14,776 --> 01:42:17,870
<i>If you want to see Miss Aisha,</i>
<i>you must go where I say.</i>

1315
01:42:18,513 --> 01:42:22,472
<i>Trade you for her.</i>
<i>No trick or Miss Aisha will die.</i>

1316
01:42:22,650 --> 01:42:24,242
Tell me where I'm to go.

1317
01:42:24,719 --> 01:42:26,277
<i>I'll tell you where to go.</i>

1318
01:42:26,454 --> 01:42:29,389
<i>It is near the border. Highway 15.</i>

1319
01:42:29,557 --> 01:42:32,583
<i>Between Al-Saidi and Mahbrouk.</i>

1320
01:42:32,760 --> 01:42:34,591
<i>That's where you go. Bye.</i>

1321
01:43:12,867 --> 01:43:14,232
Passport.

1322
01:45:06,747 --> 01:45:07,941
Bring up Pacman feed.

1323
01:45:08,116 --> 01:45:09,845
Increase magnification eight time.

1324
01:45:10,017 --> 01:45:12,076
Eight-time mag.

1325
01:45:13,121 --> 01:45:14,281
Enhance resolution.

1326
01:45:31,973 --> 01:45:35,431
Holding at mid-altitude orbit, 12,500...

1327
01:45:44,852 --> 01:45:46,752
<i>Still holding for vector angle.</i>

1328
01:45:57,932 --> 01:46:00,628
Still holding for vector angle.
- Switching over to SAR.

1329
01:46:23,324 --> 01:46:25,121
Which one do you want us to follow?

1330
01:46:29,463 --> 01:46:30,930
Which one, sir?

1331
01:46:32,233 --> 01:46:34,326
<i>Sir?</i>

1332
01:46:34,502 --> 01:46:36,493
Sorry, buddy.

1333
01:48:06,127 --> 01:48:09,528
Salaam, CIA.

1334
01:48:13,901 --> 01:48:15,391
I am not the sheik.

1335
01:48:15,569 --> 01:48:18,936
The sheik, God praise him,
is the sheik who always was.

1336
01:48:19,106 --> 01:48:20,903
I am his servant.

1337
01:48:22,810 --> 01:48:25,040
Where is the girl?

1338
01:48:25,880 --> 01:48:27,541
Either you're trying to be clever...

1339
01:48:27,715 --> 01:48:31,845
...or someone has done to you
what you so often do to them.

1340
01:48:32,019 --> 01:48:33,850
Lie.

1341
01:48:34,588 --> 01:48:36,920
So you paid for me? Hm?

1342
01:48:37,091 --> 01:48:38,718
Not as much as I would have.

1343
01:48:39,327 --> 01:48:42,626
Such a bargain for such a catch as you.

1344
01:48:42,797 --> 01:48:47,234
Well, it wasn't a bargain, because
no one's gonna negotiate with you for me.

1345
01:48:47,401 --> 01:48:51,167
That's not our policy. There will be
no exchanges. You understand that, right?

1346
01:48:51,339 --> 01:48:54,968
There will be no negotiation,
but not because you say so.

1347
01:48:55,776 --> 01:48:58,472
I have an agent of the CIA.

1348
01:48:59,046 --> 01:49:03,483
And that's what I came to see.
And that's what matters.

1349
01:49:04,885 --> 01:49:06,147
In this world...

1350
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:11,417
...there's enough poverty and frustration
and anger and passion.

1351
01:49:11,592 --> 01:49:14,356
There will never be a shortage of martyrs.

1352
01:49:15,129 --> 01:49:18,758
Just like these men, huh?
These men who are dispensable to you.

1353
01:49:18,933 --> 01:49:22,334
These men who blow themselves up
in the name of Allah...

1354
01:49:22,503 --> 01:49:25,028
...who kill their own
brothers and sisters, huh?

1355
01:49:25,206 --> 01:49:29,199
There is no place in the Koran for
the murder of innocent people and suicide.

1356
01:49:29,377 --> 01:49:31,504
- You know that.
- It's a good try.

1357
01:49:31,946 --> 01:49:36,610
But the Koran's sayings...
You speak Arabic, no?

1358
01:49:47,194 --> 01:49:51,130
So you misinterpret the one book
you believe in, hm?

1359
01:49:51,565 --> 01:49:53,157
But are you pure...

1360
01:49:53,334 --> 01:49:57,771
...or are you just as corrupt as the capitalist
Westerners that you despise?

1361
01:49:57,938 --> 01:50:00,031
To me, you are fucking slaves.

1362
01:50:00,207 --> 01:50:04,268
You're slaves to the Saudi oil sheiks
and the Wahabi oil money that funds you.

1363
01:50:04,445 --> 01:50:06,572
And when that oil money runs out,
my friends...

1364
01:50:06,747 --> 01:50:10,877
...you will all fucking disappear
into the ashes of history.

1365
01:50:11,051 --> 01:50:14,111
I am not going to torture you, Mr. Ferris.

1366
01:50:14,288 --> 01:50:18,554
I see you're not going to read
what is prepared for you on paper.

1367
01:50:18,726 --> 01:50:19,750
It's all right.

1368
01:50:20,494 --> 01:50:24,260
All I need from you, I already have.

1369
01:50:24,432 --> 01:50:26,957
You know what that camera is for?

1370
01:50:27,535 --> 01:50:31,096
It's not for this. This...
This is intermission.

1371
01:50:31,772 --> 01:50:37,574
It's for what comes after this.
For what comes now.

1372
01:50:47,087 --> 01:50:48,520
Kareem.

1373
01:50:49,423 --> 01:50:51,414
But you paid who for me?

1374
01:50:51,592 --> 01:50:54,288
An intermediary who works for who?

1375
01:50:54,462 --> 01:50:57,022
You don't know who
and that should concern you.

1376
01:50:57,198 --> 01:51:00,258
- Do I look concerned?
- Well, that's what surprises me.

1377
01:51:00,434 --> 01:51:02,698
I thought you were
a lot smarter than that.

1378
01:51:03,370 --> 01:51:06,965
Someone has betrayed you.

1379
01:51:07,141 --> 01:51:09,575
He works for the head
of Jordanian Intelligence...

1380
01:51:09,743 --> 01:51:11,506
...which means he works for us...

1381
01:51:11,679 --> 01:51:17,709
...which means...
Which means you work for us.

1382
01:51:19,854 --> 01:51:22,982
I work for you.

1383
01:51:34,101 --> 01:51:35,159
Are you comfortable?

1384
01:51:35,870 --> 01:51:37,735
Can I make you...

1385
01:51:37,905 --> 01:51:40,305
...more comfortable?

1386
01:51:46,447 --> 01:51:49,245
I'm not lying to you, Kareem.
I'm not lying to you.

1387
01:51:50,284 --> 01:51:53,913
We know... We know where you are!

1388
01:51:55,189 --> 01:51:57,214
Where am I?

1389
01:51:57,391 --> 01:52:00,360
You... You... You are in the light.

1390
01:52:00,528 --> 01:52:03,429
The light is on you. Look at it.

1391
01:52:04,498 --> 01:52:06,329
No, no, no.

1392
01:52:06,500 --> 01:52:10,197
The light...
The light is on you, motherfucker.

1393
01:52:15,509 --> 01:52:18,000
What do you think is happening here,
Mr. Ferris?

1394
01:52:18,178 --> 01:52:20,646
Do you think the cavalry
is coming for you?

1395
01:52:21,782 --> 01:52:23,545
Let's wait.

1396
01:52:25,653 --> 01:52:28,247
Nobody's coming for you.

1397
01:52:28,422 --> 01:52:30,515
Welcome to Guantanamo.

1398
01:52:33,494 --> 01:52:35,724
God! Fuck!

1399
01:53:18,472 --> 01:53:20,167
MAN

1400
01:53:41,528 --> 01:53:42,586
MAN:

1401
01:54:24,872 --> 01:54:25,964
MEN:

1402
01:55:05,312 --> 01:55:06,336
MARWAN:

1403
01:55:29,603 --> 01:55:31,594
You can tell who cares
about you the most...

1404
01:55:31,772 --> 01:55:34,673
...by who comes first
to visit you in the hospital.

1405
01:55:34,842 --> 01:55:37,402
And I believe I am the first.

1406
01:55:37,578 --> 01:55:40,240
That is not difficult,
because nobody knows where you are.

1407
01:55:40,414 --> 01:55:41,972
Yeah.

1408
01:55:42,149 --> 01:55:44,140
And where am I, Hani?

1409
01:55:44,318 --> 01:55:46,377
You're home, in Amman.

1410
01:55:48,889 --> 01:55:53,724
So it was your man I spoke to
on the phone...

1411
01:55:54,628 --> 01:55:57,654
...your men who took Aisha...

1412
01:55:57,831 --> 01:56:00,527
...your men who dropped me off
in the desert.

1413
01:56:00,701 --> 01:56:03,727
I was of some assistance, I admit.

1414
01:56:03,904 --> 01:56:07,670
But it was not me
that picked you up in the desert.

1415
01:56:07,841 --> 01:56:09,365
Edward could not find you.

1416
01:56:09,943 --> 01:56:13,538
Not with all his aircraft, all his people,
all his money...

1417
01:56:13,714 --> 01:56:16,342
...and joie de vivre.

1418
01:56:16,517 --> 01:56:18,747
So how, I wonder, did I do it?

1419
01:56:18,919 --> 01:56:22,377
- Karami.
- Very good. You remember him?

1420
01:56:22,556 --> 01:56:27,118
Yes, I remember him, Hani.
He was in the fucking room with me.

1421
01:56:27,294 --> 01:56:31,094
He was in the room
because I put him there.

1422
01:56:31,265 --> 01:56:33,699
I'm just sorry
I wasn't there a few minutes sooner.

1423
01:56:33,867 --> 01:56:37,359
Right. What would've happened
if you were a few minutes later, Hani?

1424
01:56:37,538 --> 01:56:40,234
- Then I shudder to think.
- No, I shudder to think.

1425
01:56:42,176 --> 01:56:45,577
How badly did you hurt Aisha
when you took her, huh?

1426
01:56:45,746 --> 01:56:48,271
- That's what I wanna know.
- Aisha, not at all.

1427
01:56:49,449 --> 01:56:52,043
The room we messed up
after we took her.

1428
01:56:52,219 --> 01:56:53,948
Bullshit, Hani, bullshit!

1429
01:56:54,121 --> 01:56:57,090
All right. We tested that blood! All right?
It was hers!

1430
01:56:57,257 --> 01:56:59,885
She is a nurse.
She gives blood every month.

1431
01:57:00,060 --> 01:57:02,585
Now, please, let go of the jacket.
Thank you.

1432
01:57:04,731 --> 01:57:08,098
You're trying to tell me
you didn't tell her, Hani?

1433
01:57:08,268 --> 01:57:11,499
I told her what I could,
which I admit was not very much...

1434
01:57:11,672 --> 01:57:14,072
...because these are matters
of state security.

1435
01:57:14,241 --> 01:57:16,505
So she doesn't know anything
about what happened?

1436
01:57:16,677 --> 01:57:19,669
She knows what everybody
who knows me knows.

1437
01:57:19,847 --> 01:57:23,874
That I am an exceedingly polite gentleman
and a very good conversationalist.

1438
01:57:24,051 --> 01:57:25,518
Huh.

1439
01:57:26,320 --> 01:57:29,289
If I may be so fucking impolite, Hani...

1440
01:57:29,456 --> 01:57:32,084
...I almost died in that goddamn room.

1441
01:57:32,259 --> 01:57:35,888
And if you had died,
I would have told her what you did for her.

1442
01:57:36,063 --> 01:57:40,261
And she...
She would have loved you forever.

1443
01:57:40,934 --> 01:57:44,301
Whereas now you are going
to have to earn that right.

1444
01:57:44,972 --> 01:57:47,463
That's great news.

1445
01:57:49,943 --> 01:57:51,968
Fantastic work, Hani.

1446
01:57:52,145 --> 01:57:54,170
Really. Excellent.

1447
01:57:55,182 --> 01:57:57,343
So you now have Al-Saleem, right?

1448
01:57:58,185 --> 01:58:00,050
That was the plan, my dear.

1449
01:58:01,855 --> 01:58:05,552
And I presume he's not giving you
any information.

1450
01:58:05,726 --> 01:58:07,284
Not yet.

1451
01:58:19,273 --> 01:58:21,400
Your work's done here, buddy.

1452
01:58:21,842 --> 01:58:24,242
You're gonna come back.
I got you a corner office...

1453
01:58:24,411 --> 01:58:26,538
...just down the hall from mine.

1454
01:58:26,713 --> 01:58:29,978
As soon as I get the guy who's in it
out of it, it's all yours.

1455
01:58:30,150 --> 01:58:32,380
More money, a fancy title.

1456
01:58:32,552 --> 01:58:36,352
No sunscreen, no couscous,
unless you really want it.

1457
01:58:36,523 --> 01:58:40,254
- Right down the hall from you, huh, Ed?
- Right down the hall from me.

1458
01:58:40,427 --> 01:58:44,523
Well, I think we both know you'd be
more comfortable without me there.

1459
01:58:45,265 --> 01:58:48,200
Now, don't think about it too long,
because I'll take that as a slight.

1460
01:58:48,368 --> 01:58:49,767
Hm.

1461
01:58:49,937 --> 01:58:54,499
Besides, what else are you gonna do?
Stay here?

1462
01:58:54,675 --> 01:58:57,701
Maybe for a little while, huh?
I mean, why wouldn't I?

1463
01:58:57,878 --> 01:58:59,903
Why would you?

1464
01:59:00,180 --> 01:59:02,239
What if I like the Middle East?

1465
01:59:03,784 --> 01:59:07,584
Ain't nobody likes the Middle East, buddy.
There's nothing here to like.

1466
01:59:08,055 --> 01:59:09,613
Hmm.

1467
01:59:10,023 --> 01:59:13,117
Well, maybe that's the problem right there,
isn't it, Ed?

1468
01:59:14,628 --> 01:59:15,993
Hm.

1469
01:59:16,330 --> 01:59:18,355
Oh, buddy, buddy, buddy.

1470
01:59:18,532 --> 01:59:22,696
You know, you're the best I got.

1471
01:59:22,869 --> 01:59:24,598
And you know it hurts me to say that.

1472
01:59:27,607 --> 01:59:30,667
Good luck on winning this war, Ed.

1473
01:59:30,844 --> 01:59:34,575
I hope everyone thinks
you did it all by yourself, huh?

1474
01:59:39,886 --> 01:59:41,786
You're not safe here.

1475
01:59:41,955 --> 01:59:43,718
I'm not safe anywhere.

1476
01:59:43,890 --> 01:59:45,983
You walk out on me,
you know what that means.

1477
01:59:46,159 --> 01:59:48,059
What does that mean?

1478
01:59:49,129 --> 01:59:51,063
That means you're giving up
on America.

1479
01:59:51,732 --> 01:59:55,327
Just be careful calling yourself
America, huh, Ed?

1480
01:59:56,203 --> 02:00:00,867
Listen, you have a safe flight home.
Say hey to the wife and kids.

1481
02:00:01,041 --> 02:00:03,441
Nobody's innocent in this shit, Ferris.

1482
02:01:23,423 --> 02:01:24,447
<i>What's he doing?</i>

1483
02:01:24,624 --> 02:01:26,353
<i>Nothing. Buying vegetables.</i>

1484
02:01:27,494 --> 02:01:30,395
<i>What about us, sir?</i>
<i>What do you want us to do?</i>

1485
02:01:30,564 --> 02:01:32,156
<i>Are we staying with him?</i>

1486
02:01:32,332 --> 02:01:35,199
No. Buddy's done.

1487
02:01:35,368 --> 02:01:36,926
He's all by himself.

1488
02:01:37,104 --> 02:01:40,471
<i>Copy that. Cleared off target.</i>

1489
02:08:12,799 --> 02:08:14,790
