1
00:00:42,407 --> 00:00:44,932
<i>"Winner, winner, chicken dinner."</i>

2
00:00:46,211 --> 00:00:49,703
<i>Those words had been dancing
around my head all night.</i>

3
00:00:50,748 --> 00:00:53,080
<i>I mean, it's Vegas lore, that phrase.</i>

4
00:00:53,885 --> 00:00:57,286
<i>Just ask any of the old-time pit bosses,
they'll know.</i>

5
00:01:00,525 --> 00:01:04,962
<i>It was a Chinese dealer at Binion's
who was first credited with the line.</i>

6
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,699
<i>He would shout it every time
he dealt blackjack.</i>

7
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,258
<i>That was over 40 years ago,
and the words still catch.</i>

8
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,361
<i>Winner, winner, chicken dinner. There it is!</i>

9
00:01:14,472 --> 00:01:16,838
<i>"Winner, winner, chicken dinner."</i>

10
00:01:18,009 --> 00:01:19,442
<i>Yeah, try it.</i>

11
00:01:21,713 --> 00:01:24,705
<i>I had heard it at least 14 times that night.</i>

12
00:01:25,383 --> 00:01:26,941
<i>I couldn't lose.</i>

13
00:01:28,219 --> 00:01:31,120
<i>First of all, what I was doing wasn't illegal.</i>

14
00:01:31,289 --> 00:01:34,452
<i>There were certain institutions and people
that frowned upon it,</i>

15
00:01:34,559 --> 00:01:36,720
<i>but it's legal.</i>

16
00:01:36,828 --> 00:01:38,591
<i>And not everyone can do it.</i>

17
00:01:38,696 --> 00:01:40,857
<i>Just those with gifted minds.</i>

18
00:01:41,132 --> 00:01:42,997
<i>I have a gifted mind.</i>

19
00:01:43,535 --> 00:01:46,129
<i>That's what got me into all this mess.</i>

20
00:01:46,704 --> 00:01:51,732
<i>I was counting cards
and I was up over $640,000.</i>

21
00:01:53,611 --> 00:01:56,603
<i>All right!
I'm just gonna have to split those tens.</i>

22
00:01:56,714 --> 00:01:59,444
<i>- Splitting tens.
- Splitting tens again.</i>

23
00:01:59,551 --> 00:02:01,519
<i>Well, that's all right.
I've been winning and losing for years.</i>

24
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:03,610
<i>We used hand signals, too.</i>

25
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:05,882
<i>Folded arms, the table's hot.</i>

26
00:02:06,424 --> 00:02:09,450
<i>A touch to the eye, we need to talk.</i>

27
00:02:10,228 --> 00:02:15,325
<i>And a hand running through
perfect flowing hair meant only one thing.</i>

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,661
<i>Get out. Now.</i>

29
00:02:27,979 --> 00:02:31,005
<i>"Winner, winner, chicken dinner."</i>

30
00:02:39,457 --> 00:02:44,121
Stroke. Stroke. Stroke. Stroke.

31
00:05:07,705 --> 00:05:08,933
Premed.

32
00:05:09,907 --> 00:05:11,465
4.0 GPA.

33
00:05:12,076 --> 00:05:13,634
44 MCATs.

34
00:05:14,011 --> 00:05:16,536
President, American Legion Math League.

35
00:05:16,647 --> 00:05:19,013
TA to Professors Wilkins and Sanders.

36
00:05:19,117 --> 00:05:22,382
Both of whom are friends of mine,
and who wrote glowing recommendations.

37
00:05:22,487 --> 00:05:25,513
And you're accepted early into school here
at Harvard Med,

38
00:05:25,623 --> 00:05:28,558
pending graduation from MIT.
It's very impressive.

39
00:05:28,659 --> 00:05:29,626
Thank you.

40
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:32,958
The Robinson Scholarship
is comprehensive, as you know.

41
00:05:33,064 --> 00:05:36,500
It's a free ride.
And free rides don't come easy.

42
00:05:36,601 --> 00:05:37,590
Absolutely.

43
00:05:37,702 --> 00:05:42,799
We have 76 applicants this year,
only one of whom will get the scholarship

44
00:05:42,907 --> 00:05:46,502
and most of whom have résumés
just as impressive as yours.

45
00:05:47,445 --> 00:05:48,605
Right.

46
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,375
Professor Phillips?

47
00:05:51,649 --> 00:05:55,585
Some kids grow up
wanting to play for the Red Sox.

48
00:05:55,686 --> 00:05:59,645
You know, some grow up wanting to be,
I don't know, a fireman.

49
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:05,151
I grew up... Well, really,
I just wanted to come here to Harvard Med.

50
00:06:06,264 --> 00:06:11,861
And now that I've gotten accepted,
it seems to only come down to the money.

51
00:06:12,503 --> 00:06:15,028
Which I don't really have.

52
00:06:17,408 --> 00:06:21,037
So, what I'm trying to say

53
00:06:21,145 --> 00:06:25,479
is that I really, really need this scholarship.

54
00:06:28,186 --> 00:06:29,915
Did you rehearse that?

55
00:06:30,021 --> 00:06:33,388
Yeah. Like, 14 times in front of the mirror.

56
00:06:35,059 --> 00:06:38,426
Unfortunately,
desire doesn't figure into this much.

57
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:43,665
The Robinson is going
to go to someone who

58
00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:46,431
dazzles.

59
00:06:47,572 --> 00:06:51,064
Somebody who just jumps off the page.

60
00:06:51,609 --> 00:06:55,978
Oh, well, then, I'm also involved
in a science competition.

61
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,809
We're building a robotic wheel

62
00:06:57,915 --> 00:07:02,113
that can navigate itself
using a proprietary GPS system.

63
00:07:03,921 --> 00:07:06,321
Well, I'm designing the system. So...

64
00:07:06,424 --> 00:07:07,550
Right.

65
00:07:08,092 --> 00:07:11,493
Ben, last year,
the Robinson went to Hyum Jae Wook,

66
00:07:11,596 --> 00:07:14,565
a Korean immigrant who has only one leg.

67
00:07:16,033 --> 00:07:18,763
Well, I have both my legs.

68
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,998
Well, have you considered
cutting one of them off?

69
00:07:23,307 --> 00:07:24,865
That was a joke.

70
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,777
Ben, it's all about the essay.

71
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:30,871
You need to really explain to us
what makes you special.

72
00:07:30,982 --> 00:07:34,315
What life experience separates you
from all the rest.

73
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:36,911
Life experience.

74
00:07:37,488 --> 00:07:39,718
What can you tell me, Ben,

75
00:07:39,824 --> 00:07:42,452
that's going to dazzle me?

76
00:08:07,285 --> 00:08:08,309
I'm so sorry I'm late.

77
00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:11,684
- Where is your jacket?
- Oh, I got it. I got it. It's right here.

78
00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:15,350
This is no way for the new
assistant manager to come to work.

79
00:08:15,459 --> 00:08:18,860
Congratulations.
How does $8 an hour sound?

80
00:08:18,963 --> 00:08:20,430
Eight dollars?

81
00:08:20,965 --> 00:08:25,800
Wow! Wow. That's great, Warren.
Thank you. Thank you.

82
00:08:27,471 --> 00:08:29,701
You slept with him, didn't you?

83
00:08:30,274 --> 00:08:32,765
- Yes, I did. Yes, I did.
- Yes, you did.

84
00:08:32,877 --> 00:08:35,505
I'll sleep with him, too,
and I'll get $8 an hour.

85
00:08:35,613 --> 00:08:38,741
So Palmer finishes up his lecture, right?
And I say to him,

86
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:42,580
<i>" Well, Professor Palmer, you're gonna need
at least 14 capacitance probes</i>

87
00:08:42,687 --> 00:08:44,780
<i>" to get the kind of results
that you're looking for," okay?</i>

88
00:08:44,889 --> 00:08:48,825
<i>So then he says to me, " Miles,
don't you think that's a little excessive?"</i>

89
00:08:48,926 --> 00:08:54,023
And I get up, I swear to God, Ben, I get up
in front of the entire class and I say,

90
00:08:54,131 --> 00:08:57,396
<i>" You can never have
enough capacitance probes."</i>

91
00:09:00,037 --> 00:09:03,302
Oh, my God.
What the hell is wrong with you?

92
00:09:04,775 --> 00:09:06,140
Oh, nothing.

93
00:09:06,377 --> 00:09:09,744
I hope nothing. You just got promoted, man.
You should be happy.

94
00:09:09,847 --> 00:09:14,978
I just gotta write this essay for the
Robinson Scholarship, and I have nothing.

95
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:20,116
And the reason that I have nothing
is 'cause, well, I've done nothing.

96
00:09:20,224 --> 00:09:22,920
- Oh, give me a break, Ben.
- What?

97
00:09:23,027 --> 00:09:24,756
You have everything.

98
00:09:25,162 --> 00:09:29,622
You blow me out of the water,
and I'm a cerebral stud. Is that nothing?

99
00:09:29,734 --> 00:09:30,996
Yeah, well, it doesn't dazzle.

100
00:09:31,102 --> 00:09:33,366
Hey. It dazzles me, mister.

101
00:09:34,071 --> 00:09:36,403
You know, ever since I was 16,
I crushed exams.

102
00:09:36,507 --> 00:09:39,874
I took on extracurriculars.
I showed up early.

103
00:09:39,977 --> 00:09:42,878
I even sat up at the front and I stayed late.

104
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,948
Man, I gave up everything.

105
00:09:45,316 --> 00:09:47,716
You know, I gave up fun. I gave up sex.

106
00:09:47,818 --> 00:09:49,479
I don't think you gave up sex.

107
00:09:49,587 --> 00:09:51,817
- Okay. Maybe not sex.
- Yeah, you didn't give up sex.

108
00:09:51,922 --> 00:09:53,617
All right, all right. Not sex, but...

109
00:09:53,724 --> 00:09:55,715
It just annoys me that the one thing

110
00:09:55,826 --> 00:09:58,761
that is stopping me
from going to Harvard Med is money.

111
00:09:58,863 --> 00:10:03,095
You know, tuition fees and living expenses
alone cost over $300,000.

112
00:10:03,934 --> 00:10:05,993
$300,000.

113
00:10:06,103 --> 00:10:09,402
It's outrageous. It's astronomically high.
I get that.

114
00:10:09,507 --> 00:10:13,409
You know, I just thought
there was more to life than just money.

115
00:10:15,813 --> 00:10:17,974
Well, look at the bright side,

116
00:10:18,482 --> 00:10:21,645
I just saved a bunch of money
on my car insurance.

117
00:10:31,896 --> 00:10:33,056
Thank you.

118
00:10:35,866 --> 00:10:37,925
- Happy birthday, honey.
- Thanks, Mom.

119
00:10:38,035 --> 00:10:39,332
Thank you, love. Kisses.

120
00:10:39,437 --> 00:10:40,665
Make a wish.

121
00:10:40,771 --> 00:10:42,068
- Make a wish.
- Okay.

122
00:10:44,008 --> 00:10:45,407
Bravo.

123
00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:46,840
Congratulations, Benjamin.

124
00:10:46,944 --> 00:10:49,742
Did you know Miles did the frosting on that?
You see that?

125
00:10:49,847 --> 00:10:53,010
It took me five minutes
to figure out it was a Fibonacci series...

126
00:10:53,117 --> 00:10:56,109
Where the next number is 21.
Now you're slipping, Cam.

127
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,744
Cam, you owe another six bucks.

128
00:10:57,855 --> 00:10:59,482
No, no. I didn't eat any of the Buffalo wings.

129
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:02,058
Oh, really? That's great.
Well, we're not doing it that way.

130
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:04,423
We're just dividing equally.
So let's say you pay.

131
00:11:04,528 --> 00:11:07,554
I got it, all right?
No, no. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.

132
00:11:07,665 --> 00:11:10,862
It's your birthday.
You're as broke-ass as I am.

133
00:11:10,968 --> 00:11:13,903
I just wish now
I had eaten some of those wings.

134
00:11:14,004 --> 00:11:17,371
So, I nailed the specs on the 2.09 last night,

135
00:11:17,475 --> 00:11:19,841
after 19 cups of coffee.

136
00:11:19,944 --> 00:11:22,970
- Check it out.
- You are kidding. You're kidding!

137
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:26,240
This is good. Miles, this is good.

138
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:31,583
Yeah, well, it better be 'cause this is what
we've been working for since we got here.

139
00:11:31,689 --> 00:11:33,020
This is called destiny.

140
00:11:33,124 --> 00:11:34,921
You know, there is the... Thank you.

141
00:11:35,025 --> 00:11:38,688
There is the possibility that
we might not actually win this thing.

142
00:11:38,796 --> 00:11:42,197
Oh, yeah?
Bite your tongue! Bite your damn tongue!

143
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:44,597
Look, guys,

144
00:11:46,737 --> 00:11:51,333
we don't date, we don't travel,
we don't have any money.

145
00:11:52,009 --> 00:11:56,002
The only thing that we do have
is the 2.09 Competition.

146
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,449
If we can't even win that, what's the point?

147
00:12:01,986 --> 00:12:03,954
Hey, hey. Look at this!

148
00:12:04,488 --> 00:12:06,149
No, no, no, no.

149
00:12:11,796 --> 00:12:13,457
We suck.

150
00:12:20,304 --> 00:12:23,068
Your father would be so proud of you, Ben.

151
00:12:24,775 --> 00:12:25,867
Yeah.

152
00:12:27,778 --> 00:12:30,246
Do you remember anything about him?

153
00:12:31,682 --> 00:12:35,015
Not really. Maybe when he shaved?

154
00:12:35,886 --> 00:12:38,252
Yeah, I think I watched him shave.

155
00:12:40,524 --> 00:12:43,254
So, what are your plans
for the rest of the night?

156
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,091
I don't know. I'll probably just go back
and work on that essay.

157
00:12:47,198 --> 00:12:49,166
Ben, you're working too hard.

158
00:12:49,266 --> 00:12:53,965
Between the job and school and the 2.09,
you've had no time for just yourself.

159
00:12:54,538 --> 00:12:57,871
You have to squeeze in
a little time for fun, Ben.

160
00:12:57,975 --> 00:13:02,002
You only turn 21 once.
And it goes by very fast.

161
00:13:02,112 --> 00:13:04,342
Okay. All right.

162
00:13:06,116 --> 00:13:07,310
- Good night.
- All right, good night.

163
00:13:07,418 --> 00:13:10,285
- Don't come home before 3:00.
- All right.

164
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:16,353
All right.

165
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:21,056
Now, who can explain Newton's method
and how you use it?

166
00:13:22,066 --> 00:13:25,058
You can use it to solve nonlinear equations.

167
00:13:26,937 --> 00:13:30,395
That's impressive. That's really good.
I mean, I'm very impressed by that,

168
00:13:30,507 --> 00:13:33,999
especially since my class
is called Nonlinear Equations.

169
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:38,337
All right, now somebody tell me something
I don't already know.

170
00:13:38,449 --> 00:13:39,575
Anyone?

171
00:13:39,683 --> 00:13:42,243
Bueller. Anyone? Bueller.

172
00:13:42,887 --> 00:13:44,479
Newton stole it.

173
00:13:45,489 --> 00:13:47,582
- I'm sorry?
- Newton stole it.

174
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,861
Joseph Raphson published
this same method 50 years earlier.

175
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:57,899
And if the start value is too far removed
from true zero, then it fails.

176
00:13:58,202 --> 00:14:01,797
- I'm sorry, what's your name?
- Ben. Ben Campbell.

177
00:14:01,906 --> 00:14:02,930
Ben.

178
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,873
So Ben Campbell suggests
that Joseph Raphson

179
00:14:05,976 --> 00:14:07,671
was the original author of this method.

180
00:14:07,778 --> 00:14:09,871
Well, if that's the case,
then why didn't he get any credit?

181
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:13,211
Well, for one thing,
Newton had a better publicist.

182
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:16,682
And for another, after 1700,
we know very little about Raphson

183
00:14:16,787 --> 00:14:21,349
other than the fact that he discovered the
Kabbalah about 300 years before Madonna.

184
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:24,655
All right, now, let's give Ben a chance
for some extra credit, shall we?

185
00:14:24,762 --> 00:14:29,165
We're gonna call this
the game show host problem, all right?

186
00:14:29,266 --> 00:14:31,291
Ben, suppose you're on a game show.

187
00:14:31,402 --> 00:14:34,894
And you are given a chance to choose
from three different doors, all right?

188
00:14:35,005 --> 00:14:39,908
Now, behind one of the doors is a new car.
Behind the other two, goats.

189
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:42,410
Which door would you choose, Ben?

190
00:14:42,846 --> 00:14:43,870
Door number one?

191
00:14:43,981 --> 00:14:45,778
Door number one.
Ben chooses door number one.

192
00:14:45,883 --> 00:14:47,874
All right, now, the game show host,

193
00:14:47,985 --> 00:14:50,954
who, by the way,
knows what's behind all the other doors,

194
00:14:51,055 --> 00:14:55,253
decides to open another door.
Let's say he chooses door number three.

195
00:14:55,426 --> 00:14:59,260
Behind which sits a goat. Now...

196
00:14:59,363 --> 00:15:01,160
Ben, game show host comes up to you.

197
00:15:01,265 --> 00:15:03,665
<i>He says, " Ben, do you want to stay
with door number one</i>

198
00:15:03,767 --> 00:15:05,098
<i>" or go with door number two?"</i>

199
00:15:05,202 --> 00:15:08,660
Now, is it in your interest
to switch your choice?

200
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,864
- Yeah.
- Well, wait.

201
00:15:10,975 --> 00:15:13,068
Remember, the host knows where the car is

202
00:15:13,177 --> 00:15:15,611
so how do you know
he's not playing a trick on you?

203
00:15:15,713 --> 00:15:18,580
Trying to use reverse psychology
to get you to pick a goat?

204
00:15:18,682 --> 00:15:22,914
Well, I wouldn't really care.
I mean, my answer's based on statistics.

205
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,988
Based on variable change.

206
00:15:26,156 --> 00:15:28,522
Variable change?
But he just asked you a simple question.

207
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,889
Yeah, which changed everything.

208
00:15:31,161 --> 00:15:32,526
Enlighten us.

209
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:35,894
Well, when I was originally
asked to choose a door,

210
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,458
I had a 33.3% chance of choosing right.

211
00:15:40,004 --> 00:15:43,667
But after he opens one of the doors
and then re-offers me the choice,

212
00:15:43,774 --> 00:15:47,972
it's now 66.7% if I choose to switch.

213
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:53,778
So, yeah, I'll take door number two,
and thank you for that extra 33.3%.

214
00:15:56,387 --> 00:15:57,513
Exactly.

215
00:15:57,621 --> 00:15:58,815
People, remember,

216
00:15:58,922 --> 00:16:03,154
if you don't know which door to open,
always account for variable change.

217
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,353
Now, see, most people
wouldn't take the switch

218
00:16:05,462 --> 00:16:08,954
out of paranoia, fear, emotions.

219
00:16:09,066 --> 00:16:11,967
But Mr. Campbell, he kept emotions aside

220
00:16:12,369 --> 00:16:18,899
and let simple math get his ass
into a brand-new car!

221
00:16:20,144 --> 00:16:22,271
Which is better than that goat
you've been driving around campus.

222
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:23,437
All right, everybody.

223
00:16:23,547 --> 00:16:24,946
That's the end of the day.
Thank you very much.

224
00:16:25,049 --> 00:16:26,607
Your graded papers are down here
at the end.

225
00:16:26,717 --> 00:16:29,242
You can pick them up on your way out.

226
00:16:39,663 --> 00:16:41,324
I am invincible.

227
00:16:48,272 --> 00:16:50,763
Guys, Jill Taylor, 10 o'clock.

228
00:17:05,556 --> 00:17:07,387
Man. That's brutal.

229
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,493
You know,
you should just ask her out, man.

230
00:17:12,596 --> 00:17:15,087
It's not like she's a rocket scientist
or anything.

231
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:16,791
Oh, wait, she is.

232
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,959
Well, why don't you ask her?

233
00:17:19,136 --> 00:17:22,731
Because I'm already dating someone.

234
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,631
Yeah, your right hand doesn't count, Miles.

235
00:17:25,742 --> 00:17:29,041
It does the way I use it.
It does the way I use it.

236
00:17:30,781 --> 00:17:34,740
Hey, you know what?
Maybe I don't even want to go out with her.

237
00:17:36,487 --> 00:17:38,250
Yeah, that's funny.

238
00:17:39,923 --> 00:17:43,188
You know, you say
you want a life experience, right?

239
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:47,894
Well, I'd say getting down with that
would definitely qualify.

240
00:17:48,665 --> 00:17:49,893
Cam!

241
00:18:11,188 --> 00:18:12,587
Boy genius.

242
00:18:13,524 --> 00:18:15,515
You have to follow me now.

243
00:18:15,993 --> 00:18:18,587
- Excuse me?
- You have to follow me now.

244
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:20,790
Come on.

245
00:18:28,805 --> 00:18:31,171
- Where are we going?
- You'll see.

246
00:18:47,357 --> 00:18:49,052
Our honored guest.

247
00:18:51,094 --> 00:18:52,857
- How you doing, Ben?
- I'm okay.

248
00:18:52,963 --> 00:18:55,727
- You ever been in this room before?
- Yeah.

249
00:18:56,533 --> 00:18:58,831
Organic Chemistry in my freshman year.

250
00:18:58,936 --> 00:19:01,427
- How'd you do?
- Well, I got an A.

251
00:19:05,509 --> 00:19:07,602
- Professor Rosa...
- Micky, please.

252
00:19:08,245 --> 00:19:10,611
Is there a problem with my paper?

253
00:19:10,714 --> 00:19:13,911
Well, you found a more efficient method
for finding true zero than Isaac Newton

254
00:19:14,017 --> 00:19:17,646
and that, my friend, is not so much of
a problem as it is a major ass-kicking.

255
00:19:17,754 --> 00:19:22,748
Although Newton has been dead for over
250 years, so it wasn't exactly a fair fight.

256
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,220
So, is this some kind of a math club?

257
00:19:27,397 --> 00:19:29,160
Don't be rude, people.

258
00:19:29,266 --> 00:19:31,860
- Kianna.
- Fisher.

259
00:19:31,969 --> 00:19:33,561
- Choi.
- Jill.

260
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:40,504
- You ever studied blackjack?
- No.

261
00:19:40,911 --> 00:19:43,038
No, really? Well, it's really simple, actually.

262
00:19:43,146 --> 00:19:45,239
You play against the dealer.

263
00:19:45,983 --> 00:19:47,507
You're given two cards.

264
00:19:47,618 --> 00:19:49,882
Face cards are worth 10 points.

265
00:19:49,987 --> 00:19:52,046
The closest to 21 wins.

266
00:19:52,289 --> 00:19:56,020
If you go over, you lose.
If the dealer goes over, they lose.

267
00:19:57,461 --> 00:20:00,362
It's the most popular card game
in the world.

268
00:20:00,464 --> 00:20:01,692
It's a game with memory.

269
00:20:01,798 --> 00:20:04,494
Cards drawn are the past,
ones to come are future.

270
00:20:04,601 --> 00:20:07,331
And the best part, it's beatable.

271
00:20:09,606 --> 00:20:11,801
Are you talking about counting cards?

272
00:20:11,908 --> 00:20:16,504
No. I'm talking about getting very, very rich.

273
00:20:19,182 --> 00:20:22,174
You count cards, right? All of you?

274
00:20:22,286 --> 00:20:23,776
As a team, yes.

275
00:20:24,087 --> 00:20:27,545
- When?
- Weekends. And Christian holidays.

276
00:20:28,925 --> 00:20:31,155
- Where?
- Vegas, baby.

277
00:20:32,863 --> 00:20:34,956
So, why are you telling me?

278
00:20:36,133 --> 00:20:38,897
Well, let's just say a spot opened up
on our roster.

279
00:20:39,002 --> 00:20:40,026
How?

280
00:20:40,737 --> 00:20:42,728
Jimmy got a job at Google.

281
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:46,275
- Jimmy got a job at Google?
- Yeah, it's catchy, I know.

282
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:49,206
Well, if you're making so much money
at this, then why did he take it?

283
00:20:49,313 --> 00:20:51,611
Ben, I said Google, not Sizzler.

284
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:54,711
Yeah... This is crazy.

285
00:20:54,818 --> 00:20:57,514
No, Ben. This is profitable.

286
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:03,054
Yeah, I can't do it. So, I'm sorry.

287
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:07,096
- Come on, Ben. It'll be fun.
- Yeah, Ben, it'll be fun.

288
00:21:07,197 --> 00:21:08,755
No, it's not that. It's...

289
00:21:08,865 --> 00:21:13,802
I just got a promotion at my job,
so it's kind of not a good time for me.

290
00:21:13,904 --> 00:21:15,371
We pay better.

291
00:21:16,173 --> 00:21:18,801
Look, I can't just go to Vegas on weekends.

292
00:21:18,909 --> 00:21:22,538
Why not? MIT's on cruise control for you,
you've already gotten into Harvard Med.

293
00:21:22,646 --> 00:21:24,807
I mean, what do you have to worry about?

294
00:21:24,915 --> 00:21:28,976
- How did you know that?
- I like to take an interest in my students.

295
00:21:30,554 --> 00:21:34,615
Well, I'm also really involved
in the science competition.

296
00:21:34,991 --> 00:21:37,221
You know, the 2.09 Competition?

297
00:21:38,195 --> 00:21:41,426
Wait, no.
I'm building a car that drives by itself.

298
00:21:41,531 --> 00:21:44,364
Yeah, well, it's something I've been doing
with my friends for over a year,

299
00:21:44,468 --> 00:21:46,493
so it's kind of important.

300
00:21:46,603 --> 00:21:50,437
Ben, let the car drive by itself.

301
00:21:52,676 --> 00:21:58,637
Listen, you not only have a gifted mind,
but you're also composed.

302
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:03,374
You don't give in to your emotions.
You think logically.

303
00:22:04,755 --> 00:22:07,656
Ben, you were born for this.

304
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:10,855
You'll have more fun
than you've ever had in your entire life.

305
00:22:10,961 --> 00:22:12,360
It's perfect.

306
00:22:13,663 --> 00:22:18,066
Thank you. But I'm really not the right guy.

307
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,569
So I'm sorry.

308
00:22:27,444 --> 00:22:28,570
Ben.

309
00:22:29,446 --> 00:22:32,313
I hope this little conversation
we just had will remain private.

310
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:34,111
- No, of...
- No.

311
00:22:34,751 --> 00:22:36,378
You're one of my favorite new students,

312
00:22:36,486 --> 00:22:39,717
and I'd hate to lose you,
if you know what I mean.

313
00:22:46,296 --> 00:22:48,628
- I'm just not sure it's me.
- It's boring.

314
00:22:48,732 --> 00:22:51,565
It's boxy. It's blue. How is that not you?

315
00:22:52,202 --> 00:22:53,863
So, how much is this thing gonna run me?

316
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:59,169
Oh, well, let's see, the belt's $49.95,
minus 15%.

317
00:22:59,276 --> 00:23:01,938
The jacket's $589.99.

318
00:23:02,045 --> 00:23:05,606
The pants, $285.99, minus 10% for both.

319
00:23:05,715 --> 00:23:09,981
Unfortunately, the shirt's not on sale,
but I can knock off 5% from the $69.99.

320
00:23:10,086 --> 00:23:12,213
The shoes were just marked down
from $155,

321
00:23:12,322 --> 00:23:17,885
so you're looking at $1,042.68.

322
00:23:21,097 --> 00:23:23,361
I'm pretty good with numbers.

323
00:23:24,568 --> 00:23:26,695
- Yeah.
- I guess so.

324
00:23:26,803 --> 00:23:29,101
Yeah, so let me know
when I can ring that up for you guys.

325
00:23:29,206 --> 00:23:30,340
- Yes. Thank you.
- Thanks.

326
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,102
- Yes. Thank you.
- Thanks.

327
00:23:36,413 --> 00:23:37,437
Hey.

328
00:23:40,217 --> 00:23:41,241
Hey.

329
00:23:42,486 --> 00:23:45,387
- Could you help me?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure.

330
00:23:46,189 --> 00:23:48,521
I'm looking for a tie.

331
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:53,028
Oh, well, we're having a 15% sale
on the ties.

332
00:23:54,264 --> 00:23:57,756
And if you want,
I could probably get you an additional 10%

333
00:23:57,868 --> 00:23:59,893
with my employee discount.

334
00:24:01,037 --> 00:24:03,505
- This one's nice.
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

335
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:10,206
This one has actually been treated with
our patented Nano-Tex fabric protection,

336
00:24:10,313 --> 00:24:14,374
you know, to repel liquids and stains.

337
00:24:14,484 --> 00:24:19,012
- Well, that's really functional.
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's pretty functional.

338
00:24:19,689 --> 00:24:21,657
Face me. Stay still.

339
00:24:23,693 --> 00:24:27,060
Despite being tempted
by the Nano-Tex repellant,

340
00:24:28,732 --> 00:24:32,725
I'm actually not here for a tie, Ben.

341
00:24:35,305 --> 00:24:36,932
I came to see you.

342
00:24:38,241 --> 00:24:39,435
You did?

343
00:24:41,711 --> 00:24:43,042
Blackjack's a great game.

344
00:24:43,146 --> 00:24:44,773
No, look, it's easy to learn

345
00:24:44,881 --> 00:24:48,681
and there's really not as much strategy to it
as people think.

346
00:24:48,885 --> 00:24:50,876
I grew up on it, actually.

347
00:24:51,488 --> 00:24:54,423
- You grew up on it?
- Yeah.

348
00:24:55,458 --> 00:24:58,757
Every night after dinner,
my father and I would play.

349
00:24:58,995 --> 00:25:02,487
I knew basic strategy
before I was, like, nine years old.

350
00:25:03,533 --> 00:25:06,093
If I won, he'd take me out for ice cream.

351
00:25:06,202 --> 00:25:08,067
And what if he won?

352
00:25:10,206 --> 00:25:11,696
He'd still take me out for ice cream.

353
00:25:11,808 --> 00:25:15,141
Oh, yeah. Sure, yeah, he's your dad.

354
00:25:17,247 --> 00:25:20,512
Ben, you should feel the thrill

355
00:25:21,017 --> 00:25:24,714
of winning more money
than you can possibly imagine.

356
00:25:30,727 --> 00:25:32,957
I think you should come to Vegas.

357
00:25:33,063 --> 00:25:37,466
'Cause I'm guessing that you could
probably use a break from this place.

358
00:25:43,206 --> 00:25:44,400
I can't.

359
00:25:45,208 --> 00:25:46,607
I'm sorry.

360
00:25:47,711 --> 00:25:49,144
I just can't.

361
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,714
Okay. If you change your mind,
you know where we meet.

362
00:25:55,418 --> 00:25:56,578
Yeah.

363
00:25:57,354 --> 00:25:59,219
You're welcome any time.

364
00:26:04,227 --> 00:26:07,094
You know,
I think the best thing about Vegas

365
00:26:07,797 --> 00:26:10,265
is you can become anyone you want.

366
00:26:39,796 --> 00:26:40,990
- What's the count?
- Plus 9.

367
00:26:41,097 --> 00:26:42,064
- No.
- Plus 11.

368
00:26:42,165 --> 00:26:43,154
No.

369
00:26:43,466 --> 00:26:46,299
<i>- Dude, I lost count 20 cards ago.
- Don't call me " dude."</i>

370
00:26:46,403 --> 00:26:47,802
- Plus 9?
- You're just following Jill.

371
00:26:47,904 --> 00:26:51,067
People, please. We had a total of 76 cards
that came out of the deck.

372
00:26:51,174 --> 00:26:53,301
Twenty-three were high cards
with a value of minus one.

373
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:55,503
Seventeen were neutral with no value at all,

374
00:26:55,612 --> 00:26:57,341
and the rest were low cards
with a value of plus one.

375
00:26:57,447 --> 00:27:00,075
- How could you lose the count?
- Plus 13.

376
00:27:02,552 --> 00:27:05,112
The count. It's plus 13.

377
00:27:08,591 --> 00:27:09,683
Yes.

378
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,452
Pull up a chair.

379
00:27:20,136 --> 00:27:21,228
Stop.

380
00:27:22,005 --> 00:27:24,769
- What is it?
- Plus 12. Eggs.

381
00:27:24,874 --> 00:27:26,842
<i>Twelve eggs in a carton.</i>

382
00:27:27,177 --> 00:27:29,236
- Now what?
- Plus 9.

383
00:27:29,345 --> 00:27:30,403
<i>Cats have nine lives.</i>

384
00:27:30,513 --> 00:27:31,480
Cat.

385
00:27:32,949 --> 00:27:34,314
<i>Sweet 16.</i>

386
00:27:34,584 --> 00:27:36,677
<i>Every card had a value.</i>

387
00:27:36,786 --> 00:27:40,882
<i>A high card, minus one.
A low card, plus one.</i>

388
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:42,480
<i>The rest, zero.</i>

389
00:27:42,592 --> 00:27:45,857
Plus 13. Plus 8. Plus 9. Plus 12.

390
00:27:47,197 --> 00:27:49,665
<i>I was studying all day, every day.</i>

391
00:27:49,766 --> 00:27:54,226
<i>But it wasn't physics, chemistry
and engineering. I was back to simple math,</i>

392
00:27:54,337 --> 00:27:57,397
<i>used in ways I could never have imagined.</i>

393
00:27:59,375 --> 00:28:01,172
<i>The team had a system.</i>

394
00:28:01,544 --> 00:28:04,945
<i>And to go unnoticed,
we created a whole new language.</i>

395
00:28:06,216 --> 00:28:09,310
<i>Words were numbers,
and numbers were words.</i>

396
00:28:09,586 --> 00:28:11,053
- Plus 17.
- Magazine.

397
00:28:11,154 --> 00:28:12,178
- Plus 6.
- Gun.

398
00:28:12,288 --> 00:28:14,085
- Plus 15.
- Paycheck.

399
00:28:14,424 --> 00:28:15,686
Plus 12.

400
00:28:15,792 --> 00:28:17,885
Is this chemistry review?

401
00:28:22,732 --> 00:28:24,290
- Plus 14.
- Ring.

402
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,526
- Plus 16.
- Sweet.

403
00:28:25,635 --> 00:28:27,000
Use it in a sentence.

404
00:28:27,103 --> 00:28:29,367
Man, that sugar's sweet.

405
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:34,569
<i>Because I knew the count,
I knew which cards were left in the deck.</i>

406
00:28:34,677 --> 00:28:36,201
<i>That's how I knew what to bet.</i>

407
00:28:36,312 --> 00:28:38,007
You're doing great.

408
00:28:39,382 --> 00:28:44,081
Micky, I just want to let you know
that I'm only doing this for medical school,

409
00:28:44,187 --> 00:28:46,212
which is $300,000.

410
00:28:46,322 --> 00:28:49,985
I mean, if I can get anything close to that,
then I'm done.

411
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:53,525
<i>Well, in the first place, Ben,
it's not " if," it's " when."</i>

412
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:56,292
And second of all,
I get it. I completely understand.

413
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,027
- You do?
- Yeah. It's a means to an end.

414
00:28:59,135 --> 00:29:02,400
Look, they've got this new computer
software that reads people's faces,

415
00:29:02,505 --> 00:29:05,872
so who knows how long this gig's
gonna last for any of us?

416
00:29:05,975 --> 00:29:07,704
What if we get caught?

417
00:29:07,811 --> 00:29:10,871
Our system keeps us under the radar,
you'll see.

418
00:29:11,014 --> 00:29:13,642
Anyway, counting cards isn't illegal.

419
00:29:14,551 --> 00:29:19,011
- So, there's no danger in it at all?
- No, Ben, it's safe. Very safe.

420
00:29:22,926 --> 00:29:25,292
You think you can beat the system?

421
00:29:26,229 --> 00:29:30,063
This is the system, beating you back.

422
00:29:32,836 --> 00:29:35,964
You wanna count cards,
you do it in Atlantic City.

423
00:29:38,107 --> 00:29:40,371
- Get him up.
- Come on, kid.

424
00:29:40,476 --> 00:29:42,034
Count to five.

425
00:29:43,179 --> 00:29:45,841
- Count to five!
- What?

426
00:29:46,149 --> 00:29:49,585
Count to five so I know you don't have
brain damage, you can go home.

427
00:29:49,686 --> 00:29:50,812
Start with one.

428
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,514
One, two, three, four, five.

429
00:29:53,623 --> 00:29:57,821
Good. Now, stop counting.

430
00:30:01,497 --> 00:30:02,725
Let's go.

431
00:30:06,936 --> 00:30:08,870
<i>You're crazy,
everybody knows to split eights.</i>

432
00:30:08,972 --> 00:30:10,030
<i>My grandmother splits eights.</i>

433
00:30:10,139 --> 00:30:12,699
Not against a 10. It's a sucker play.

434
00:30:12,809 --> 00:30:14,436
Look, you're choosing to play two hands

435
00:30:14,544 --> 00:30:17,069
against the highest up card
a dealer can have, right?

436
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,205
Against a five or a six, it'd be fine.

437
00:30:19,315 --> 00:30:21,374
Against a 10 or an ace, it's a sucker play.

438
00:30:21,484 --> 00:30:24,112
Yeah, Kianna, save it, all right?
Jill's right. All right?

439
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:26,518
Choi, why don't you explain to Ben
how we do?

440
00:30:26,623 --> 00:30:27,988
Oh, all right.

441
00:30:28,091 --> 00:30:31,527
So, our team is divided
into two kinds of players,

442
00:30:31,628 --> 00:30:33,357
spotters and big players, right?

443
00:30:33,463 --> 00:30:36,921
So if you think that this table
is the casino floor,

444
00:30:38,568 --> 00:30:40,832
then salt and pepper shakers
are your spotters.

445
00:30:40,937 --> 00:30:43,735
Spotters are just sitting
at the various blackjack tables

446
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,173
and they're betting the table minimum.
They never fluctuate their bet.

447
00:30:47,277 --> 00:30:50,269
That's right. Spotters never raise the bet
or play any kind of progressive system.

448
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:53,110
That's how we stay under the radar,
and that's why we never get caught.

449
00:30:53,216 --> 00:30:56,276
Exactly. Okay, they're just sitting
at the table, betting the table min,

450
00:30:56,386 --> 00:30:58,946
and they're keeping the count
waiting for one of these decks to get hot.

451
00:30:59,055 --> 00:31:00,784
Right. And then when one of the decks
gets hot,

452
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:03,381
the spotter at that table signals
in the big player.

453
00:31:03,493 --> 00:31:05,927
This... Mustard.
Give me the mustard, honey. Please.

454
00:31:06,029 --> 00:31:08,088
Well, I'm always the mustard, so...

455
00:31:08,197 --> 00:31:12,361
When I get the signal for the hot deck,
I stumble over like some drunk rich kid,

456
00:31:12,468 --> 00:31:16,370
or some zoned out dot-com millionaire,
and I throw down big money.

457
00:31:16,472 --> 00:31:19,168
So the big player bets big
and still keeps the count.

458
00:31:19,275 --> 00:31:21,470
When the deck cools, he cashes in.

459
00:31:21,577 --> 00:31:23,067
It's not as easy as it sounds.

460
00:31:23,179 --> 00:31:24,612
Oh, yeah, it's not, you know,

461
00:31:24,714 --> 00:31:27,342
because if Grey Poupon over here
ever loses the count,

462
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:30,283
it's up to his table's spotter
to give him the signal to get out.

463
00:31:30,386 --> 00:31:32,980
- And you know the signals, right?
- Yeah.

464
00:31:33,222 --> 00:31:34,280
Show us.

465
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:35,789
Okay, what's this?

466
00:31:35,892 --> 00:31:38,292
- The deck's hot.
- Right.

467
00:31:38,394 --> 00:31:40,259
We need to talk.

468
00:31:41,264 --> 00:31:42,925
The deck's cooling.

469
00:31:44,067 --> 00:31:46,194
And get out. Get out now.

470
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:52,000
Good. I think he's gonna be ready
for our little trial run tomorrow.

471
00:31:53,209 --> 00:31:54,972
There's a trial run?

472
00:31:55,712 --> 00:31:58,374
- Where?
- You'll find out.

473
00:32:49,399 --> 00:32:50,525
Hey.

474
00:33:08,217 --> 00:33:10,014
- You Ben?
- Yeah.

475
00:33:10,386 --> 00:33:11,683
Follow me.

476
00:33:19,962 --> 00:33:21,224
This way.

477
00:33:28,671 --> 00:33:30,866
Go, go. You go.

478
00:33:45,088 --> 00:33:47,852
No more bet. No more bet.

479
00:33:53,329 --> 00:33:54,887
Come on, money.

480
00:33:54,997 --> 00:33:56,794
Today, 14.

481
00:33:56,899 --> 00:33:58,662
Whose side are you on?

482
00:34:07,043 --> 00:34:08,203
Sixteen.

483
00:34:08,311 --> 00:34:10,404
Thank you. Sorry, gentlemen.

484
00:34:13,015 --> 00:34:16,178
So, Henry, did I tell you I read
about this place in a magazine?

485
00:34:25,161 --> 00:34:28,653
- You wanna put that money down?
- Yeah. $300.

486
00:34:28,865 --> 00:34:30,025
$300.

487
00:34:40,309 --> 00:34:41,469
$300.

488
00:34:42,745 --> 00:34:44,212
You bet, sir?

489
00:34:46,082 --> 00:34:47,344
Thanks.

490
00:35:06,936 --> 00:35:09,166
Winner, winner, chicken dinner.

491
00:35:09,338 --> 00:35:13,240
<i>" Winner, winner, chicken dinner." All right.</i>

492
00:35:16,312 --> 00:35:17,574
Nice.

493
00:35:21,717 --> 00:35:24,015
Can I get another drink, please?

494
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,617
Thank you.

495
00:35:28,391 --> 00:35:30,222
What the hell are you doing?

496
00:35:30,326 --> 00:35:33,454
What are you doing?
I haven't done anything! Get off me!

497
00:35:33,563 --> 00:35:35,190
Get off, I haven't done anything!

498
00:35:37,266 --> 00:35:38,927
Please. Please let go.

499
00:35:39,035 --> 00:35:40,832
- What's the count?
- Please don't hurt me.

500
00:35:40,937 --> 00:35:43,303
- I said, what's the count?
- Look, I haven't even done anything!

501
00:35:43,406 --> 00:35:44,964
What's the count?

502
00:35:47,476 --> 00:35:49,068
Plus 18.

503
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:55,908
Oh, you've gotta be kidding.

504
00:35:56,018 --> 00:35:57,178
Congratulations, Ben.

505
00:35:57,286 --> 00:35:59,516
Sorry, we had to make sure
you'd keep the count under pressure.

506
00:35:59,622 --> 00:36:01,385
Welcome to the team.

507
00:36:02,858 --> 00:36:04,086
We didn't mean it.

508
00:36:04,193 --> 00:36:07,128
It's okay, Campbell, I cried inside that bag.

509
00:36:15,504 --> 00:36:18,701
Fisher and Jimmy
have always been the big players.

510
00:36:18,808 --> 00:36:21,106
I want you to take Jimmy's place.

511
00:36:22,278 --> 00:36:23,643
I've never done this.

512
00:36:23,746 --> 00:36:24,974
I know that and I understand.

513
00:36:25,081 --> 00:36:28,209
But I don't trust the girls,
and Choi is, well, Choi.

514
00:36:28,317 --> 00:36:30,478
Look, I've been teaching
for more than 14 years,

515
00:36:30,586 --> 00:36:32,383
and I've never had a student
as impressive as you.

516
00:36:32,488 --> 00:36:34,718
Your brain is like a goddamn Pentium chip.

517
00:36:34,824 --> 00:36:37,349
You're gonna do great.
You know how I know that?

518
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:40,293
'Cause you remind me of myself
25 years ago.

519
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:42,690
You in?

520
00:36:43,899 --> 00:36:47,300
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm in.
- Good. Good.

521
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:51,401
There's one more thing, Ben,
and this is important.

522
00:36:54,243 --> 00:36:57,007
We're counting cards, we're not gambling.

523
00:36:57,246 --> 00:37:00,340
We're following a specific set of rules
and playing a system.

524
00:37:00,449 --> 00:37:01,438
Right.

525
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:03,575
I've seen how crazy
it can get at those tables,

526
00:37:03,686 --> 00:37:06,587
and sometimes, people lose control.

527
00:37:07,023 --> 00:37:09,184
They give in to their emotions.

528
00:37:10,459 --> 00:37:11,892
You will not.

529
00:37:13,129 --> 00:37:14,653
You understand?

530
00:37:15,798 --> 00:37:16,822
Yeah.

531
00:37:18,267 --> 00:37:19,734
Get some rest.

532
00:37:20,369 --> 00:37:22,394
- Some rest?
- Yeah, we're leaving tomorrow.

533
00:37:22,505 --> 00:37:26,134
Tomorrow? I have a Quantitative Literacy
paper due Tuesday.

534
00:37:26,575 --> 00:37:28,668
- No, you don't.
- I don't?

535
00:37:28,778 --> 00:37:30,643
No, I spoke to Professor O'Reilly.

536
00:37:30,746 --> 00:37:32,907
I told him you were helping me
with a special assignment,

537
00:37:33,015 --> 00:37:35,643
and he understood, so he gave you an A.

538
00:37:36,852 --> 00:37:40,344
You see, Ben, amazing things
can happen from the inside.

539
00:37:40,456 --> 00:37:43,050
You'll get a call about details later.

540
00:37:45,795 --> 00:37:47,228
So did the girls go on ahead, huh?

541
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:49,662
Oh, yeah. They got a lot more bags
to check, you know?

542
00:37:49,765 --> 00:37:50,823
Okay.

543
00:37:50,933 --> 00:37:53,834
Well, wait for us by security
'cause Ben and I are gonna hit the head.

544
00:37:53,936 --> 00:37:55,028
No, I'm good.

545
00:37:55,137 --> 00:37:57,469
No, I really think you should go.
It's a long flight.

546
00:37:57,573 --> 00:38:00,440
- No, I'm okay.
- We're going to the bathroom.

547
00:38:03,579 --> 00:38:05,308
Honestly, I really don't have to go.

548
00:38:05,414 --> 00:38:07,814
- I don't care what you have to do.
- Look, I really don't have to...

549
00:38:07,917 --> 00:38:08,975
Please just shut up.

550
00:38:09,085 --> 00:38:11,315
Why are you looking over there?
Look, I don't...

551
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,513
I don't care. Shut up. Get in here.

552
00:38:13,622 --> 00:38:15,817
- What are you doing?
- Let's go.

553
00:38:17,026 --> 00:38:19,256
- Pull down your pants.
- What?

554
00:38:20,262 --> 00:38:21,991
Don't ask questions.

555
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,827
- Shove these in your underwear.
- Why?

556
00:38:26,936 --> 00:38:30,269
You want me to do it?
'Cause, I swear to God, I will.

557
00:38:32,041 --> 00:38:35,101
- Why can't we leave it in the bag?
- Because it shows up on the scanner.

558
00:38:35,211 --> 00:38:37,338
And we're not about
to have them confiscate $250,000.

559
00:38:37,446 --> 00:38:39,175
$250,000?

560
00:38:39,615 --> 00:38:43,244
- No. Why do I have to do it?
- 'Cause you're the donkey boy.

561
00:38:43,886 --> 00:38:46,548
You really suck at not asking questions.

562
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,589
What's a donkey boy?

563
00:38:54,196 --> 00:38:56,494
- Step forward, sir.
- Thanks.

564
00:38:57,933 --> 00:39:00,663
- In the basket, please.
- There's a table when you get to the line.

565
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:04,399
Act casual, think casual, be casual.

566
00:39:04,507 --> 00:39:07,203
Remove your keys, any metal objects.
Laptops out, please.

567
00:39:07,309 --> 00:39:08,640
Thank you.

568
00:39:10,112 --> 00:39:14,208
If you have liquids in a Ziploc bag,
please show them to us now.

569
00:39:14,316 --> 00:39:16,375
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

570
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,669
Your boarding pass.

571
00:39:59,695 --> 00:40:00,719
Sir?

572
00:40:13,342 --> 00:40:15,071
You forgot your bag.

573
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,877
Thanks.

574
00:42:18,467 --> 00:42:20,128
Nice going, Campbell.

575
00:42:20,235 --> 00:42:24,899
Hey, Ben.
Basic strategy says you should hit that.

576
00:42:36,418 --> 00:42:40,115
Burt, Moishe, Vladimir,

577
00:42:40,222 --> 00:42:43,419
Mona, Miss Sommers,
your new identities are on the bar.

578
00:42:43,525 --> 00:42:45,516
So glad you could make it.

579
00:42:45,761 --> 00:42:47,626
Vladimir Stupnitsky?

580
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:50,028
Yeah. Your dad's a diplomat
with the Russian consulate.

581
00:42:50,132 --> 00:42:51,292
You live in Washington, D.C.

582
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:55,166
Your hobbies are backgammon, chess
and long walks on the beach.

583
00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:57,534
- I don't like my name.
- Why not?

584
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:00,734
<i>" Sierra Sommers." Do I look like a Sierra?</i>

585
00:43:00,843 --> 00:43:03,038
Well, you have a lot of clever outfits.
You'll figure it out.

586
00:43:03,145 --> 00:43:06,308
Just pretend you don't speak English.
Then you don't have to change your hair.

587
00:43:06,415 --> 00:43:09,612
You know, I thought this was legal.
Why do we have to use fake names?

588
00:43:09,718 --> 00:43:11,948
Well, it is. We not only use fake names,
we use disguises.

589
00:43:12,054 --> 00:43:14,750
It's for the benefit of the dealers
to make sure you're old enough to gamble

590
00:43:14,857 --> 00:43:17,121
and it allows everyone to be different people
in different casinos.

591
00:43:17,226 --> 00:43:21,253
Hey! You steal the Bible, you go to hell.
That's the way it works.

592
00:43:21,697 --> 00:43:23,062
Like I'm not going already.

593
00:43:23,165 --> 00:43:24,257
Yeah. All right. Now, listen.

594
00:43:24,366 --> 00:43:27,301
Ben, this is for you.
All the casinos have cameras in the ceiling.

595
00:43:27,403 --> 00:43:28,768
<i>They're called " eyes in the sky."</i>

596
00:43:28,871 --> 00:43:31,806
For their benefit, order a tonic water
and lime and act a little drunk,

597
00:43:31,907 --> 00:43:34,398
and at all times, you don't know each other.

598
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:38,810
Let me say that one more time,
you do not know each other ever.

599
00:43:40,049 --> 00:43:41,141
And what's our motto?

600
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:43,184
- Don't get caught counting.
- Don't get caught counting.

601
00:43:43,285 --> 00:43:44,980
Thank you very much.

602
00:43:46,055 --> 00:43:47,613
How come you don't play?

603
00:43:47,723 --> 00:43:50,920
Oh, I did. I played for a long time
and I was the best. But I'm retired now.

604
00:43:51,026 --> 00:43:53,927
Take my advice, Ben, it's always best
to go out when you're on top.

605
00:43:54,029 --> 00:43:55,621
Welcome to Vegas.

606
00:44:05,874 --> 00:44:07,000
No more bets.

607
00:44:07,109 --> 00:44:08,940
All right, here we go.
Big money, now. Big money.

608
00:44:09,044 --> 00:44:12,104
Let me tell you about blackjack, honey.
You ever hear of basic strategy?

609
00:44:12,214 --> 00:44:14,944
Oh, see,
now that sounds really complicated.

610
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:17,211
- I'm Sierra Sommers from Charleston.
- Pleasure.

611
00:44:17,319 --> 00:44:19,981
Here to double my family's inheritance.

612
00:44:21,757 --> 00:44:23,247
I don't know.

613
00:44:43,011 --> 00:44:44,478
$10,000.

614
00:44:45,481 --> 00:44:47,381
Changing $10,000.

615
00:44:47,483 --> 00:44:49,348
Sweet. Too sweet.

616
00:45:10,038 --> 00:45:12,632
<i>Eight. The count's still plus 16.</i>

617
00:45:14,243 --> 00:45:16,211
<i>Ten. That's minus one.</i>

618
00:45:16,545 --> 00:45:18,172
<i>Count's plus 15.</i>

619
00:45:19,581 --> 00:45:22,175
<i>Eight. Still plus 15.</i>

620
00:45:23,752 --> 00:45:25,720
<i>Nine. Plus 15.</i>

621
00:45:27,723 --> 00:45:30,351
<i>Five. The count's 16.</i>

622
00:45:31,994 --> 00:45:33,757
<i>Eights. Split eights.</i>

623
00:45:34,062 --> 00:45:35,086
Can I split those?

624
00:45:35,197 --> 00:45:38,189
- Sir, please don't touch the cards.
- I'm sorry.

625
00:45:45,407 --> 00:45:47,932
<i>Jack. Count's plus 15.</i>

626
00:45:51,313 --> 00:45:53,679
<i>Ten. Plus 14.</i>

627
00:45:59,888 --> 00:46:02,755
<i>King. Nine. Plus 13.</i>

628
00:46:09,765 --> 00:46:11,255
<i>Jack. Plus 12.</i>

629
00:46:12,301 --> 00:46:14,326
<i>Nine. Still plus 12.</i>

630
00:46:14,803 --> 00:46:16,168
<i>Blackjack.</i>

631
00:47:01,984 --> 00:47:03,383
Monkey! Monkey!

632
00:47:03,485 --> 00:47:05,385
- So what's a monkey?
- Face card.

633
00:47:05,487 --> 00:47:08,888
All right, face card.
Come on, monkey. Okay, monkey.

634
00:47:12,427 --> 00:47:13,587
Monkey!

635
00:47:13,962 --> 00:47:15,361
Monkey! Come on, give us a monkey!

636
00:47:15,464 --> 00:47:18,627
Monkey! Come on, monkey,
monkey, monkey! Monkey.

637
00:47:18,734 --> 00:47:20,224
Monkey! Monkey!

638
00:47:23,538 --> 00:47:25,403
All right, all right.

639
00:47:28,944 --> 00:47:31,139
Oh, God.

640
00:47:32,281 --> 00:47:33,805
I need to quit.

641
00:47:38,687 --> 00:47:40,780
Could I color up, please?

642
00:48:23,699 --> 00:48:25,064
Nice undies.

643
00:48:31,606 --> 00:48:33,631
- What's this?
- It's last night's take.

644
00:48:33,742 --> 00:48:35,573
We split it five ways.

645
00:48:40,816 --> 00:48:42,511
So, what do you think?

646
00:48:42,617 --> 00:48:44,244
Yeah, it was fun.

647
00:48:44,686 --> 00:48:46,153
- You were good.
- Really?

648
00:48:46,254 --> 00:48:49,690
Yeah. Came in quick off the count.
You acted the part.

649
00:48:49,791 --> 00:48:53,750
You weren't afraid to play big, and
you got out when you were supposed to.

650
00:48:55,564 --> 00:48:58,055
And you made more money than Fisher.

651
00:48:58,333 --> 00:49:00,893
I was pretty nervous, actually.

652
00:49:01,536 --> 00:49:04,972
You know, but after a while,
it felt kind of easy.

653
00:49:06,775 --> 00:49:08,299
Not for everyone.

654
00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:10,537
Yeah, it's just simple math.

655
00:49:11,113 --> 00:49:14,014
Good.
We can do some serious damage with you.

656
00:49:19,421 --> 00:49:21,753
Here's the thing I told Micky.

657
00:49:22,157 --> 00:49:26,355
You know, I'm only really doing this
just to pay for medical school.

658
00:49:26,461 --> 00:49:29,123
You know, $300,000 and then I'm out.

659
00:49:31,666 --> 00:49:33,793
That's what they all say.

660
00:49:34,569 --> 00:49:38,198
No, really, I mean, I'm just doing this
to pay for Harvard.

661
00:49:38,306 --> 00:49:40,774
It's just a means to an end for me.

662
00:49:42,644 --> 00:49:44,111
I believe you.

663
00:49:44,579 --> 00:49:45,671
Good.

664
00:49:55,891 --> 00:49:58,951
<i>- Hello?
- We have a team meeting in five minutes.</i>

665
00:50:00,762 --> 00:50:01,751
Team meeting.

666
00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:03,458
Hello?

667
00:50:03,565 --> 00:50:04,827
- Hey.
- Hey.

668
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,667
Where's everybody else?

669
00:50:06,768 --> 00:50:09,532
I don't know. Fisher was right behind us.

670
00:50:13,508 --> 00:50:15,635
Oh, Fisher, you didn't sleep.

671
00:50:16,011 --> 00:50:20,471
- I did. With Ida.
- Ida?

672
00:50:20,982 --> 00:50:24,611
She's a dancer. I pulled her out of Sapphire.

673
00:50:25,153 --> 00:50:29,590
- And Ida's her dancer name?
- Yeah. After her grandmother.

674
00:50:30,625 --> 00:50:32,092
Where's Kianna?

675
00:50:32,394 --> 00:50:33,554
Slots.

676
00:50:34,830 --> 00:50:39,028
- Choi, where the hell you been?
- Unattended maid cart, ninth floor.

677
00:50:39,835 --> 00:50:42,065
I've been busy this morning.

678
00:50:45,474 --> 00:50:46,873
All right, guys, let's get something clear.

679
00:50:46,975 --> 00:50:49,205
This is not summer camp
and I'm not your counselor.

680
00:50:49,311 --> 00:50:51,711
This is real, world-class
moneymaking business.

681
00:50:51,813 --> 00:50:53,804
Kianna, slots are for losers.

682
00:50:53,915 --> 00:50:56,076
Fisher, peelers are stealers.

683
00:50:56,384 --> 00:50:57,442
Choi?

684
00:50:57,752 --> 00:51:01,916
You made five grand last night,
so would you stop stealing nine-cent pens

685
00:51:02,023 --> 00:51:05,823
and everything you can get your hands on
from the maid's cart? It's embarrassing.

686
00:51:05,927 --> 00:51:09,988
But, Fisher,
what the hell were you up to last night?

687
00:51:10,365 --> 00:51:11,389
What?

688
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:14,492
Three separate occasions, the spotters
let you know that the deck was cooling,

689
00:51:14,603 --> 00:51:15,797
but you kept on anyway.

690
00:51:15,904 --> 00:51:17,496
You either lost the count
or you lost your head.

691
00:51:17,606 --> 00:51:19,540
In either case,
I don't wanna see it happen again.

692
00:51:19,641 --> 00:51:21,506
Jill, nice disguise last night.

693
00:51:21,610 --> 00:51:26,274
And Ben, good work. You came out
of that chute like a pro. Keep it up.

694
00:51:27,349 --> 00:51:28,338
Beginner's luck.

695
00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:31,442
Hey, Fisher. Win like a man, lose like a man.

696
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:34,079
Micky, I didn't play
into a cold deck three times.

697
00:51:34,189 --> 00:51:35,520
You know what's worse than a loser?

698
00:51:35,624 --> 00:51:38,855
Someone who won't admit
he played it wrong.

699
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,825
Take it up with Ida.

700
00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:43,258
Who's Ida?

701
00:51:44,199 --> 00:51:45,757
- Who the hell is Ida?
- Shut up.

702
00:51:45,867 --> 00:51:47,858
- Who the hell is Ida?
- Shut up.

703
00:52:14,796 --> 00:52:16,787
There goes that paycheck.

704
00:52:24,739 --> 00:52:27,640
- Money plays.
- Money plays, up to the limit.

705
00:52:30,879 --> 00:52:32,813
How's she doing?

706
00:52:33,215 --> 00:52:34,512
Oh, that doesn't matter, man.

707
00:52:34,616 --> 00:52:37,517
The way I see it, yesterday's history,
tomorrow's a mystery.

708
00:52:37,619 --> 00:52:40,417
It's all what you do in the moment, baby.

709
00:52:52,567 --> 00:52:54,626
Just lost another property.

710
00:52:55,704 --> 00:52:59,105
- Who is it this time, Caesars or the Mirage?
- Caesars.

711
00:53:00,709 --> 00:53:02,768
That was a 14-year account.

712
00:53:03,111 --> 00:53:07,047
- They opted to go with the new software.
- I know, Terry, I know.

713
00:53:07,682 --> 00:53:12,642
Hey, Cole. We got absolutely murdered in
pits four and five the last couple of nights.

714
00:53:12,754 --> 00:53:15,552
Okay, Clark, I'll take a look at the tape.

715
00:53:15,757 --> 00:53:19,193
By the way, you wanna lose the cigarette?

716
00:53:20,662 --> 00:53:23,654
There's no smoking in here, you know that.

717
00:53:29,804 --> 00:53:31,328
I appreciate it.

718
00:53:38,013 --> 00:53:39,981
End of an era, my friend.

719
00:53:49,224 --> 00:53:51,055
Ben. Time for school.

720
00:53:54,896 --> 00:53:57,057
I seem to keep waking up to you.

721
00:53:57,165 --> 00:53:58,826
Don't get used to it.

722
00:54:17,819 --> 00:54:20,310
I'm glad you came over this morning.

723
00:54:21,456 --> 00:54:24,425
- I have something I wanna give you.
- Oh, yeah?

724
00:54:26,895 --> 00:54:28,920
I want you to have this.

725
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:30,893
What's this?

726
00:54:36,504 --> 00:54:38,335
That's a lot of money.

727
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:42,469
I've been saving for a long time.
It's for medical school.

728
00:54:42,577 --> 00:54:46,911
I know it won't pay the whole way,
but it should help.

729
00:54:48,216 --> 00:54:51,083
Ma, I can't take this.

730
00:54:51,586 --> 00:54:53,713
This is your money.
You worked hard for this.

731
00:54:53,822 --> 00:54:58,623
For precisely this reason. I wanna help pay
for med school, Dr. Campbell.

732
00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:06,664
Well, you know what? You don't have to.

733
00:55:06,768 --> 00:55:10,204
'Cause I got the Robinson Scholarship.

734
00:55:10,972 --> 00:55:13,497
Yep, they're gonna pay the whole way.

735
00:55:14,042 --> 00:55:17,842
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Well, because I wanted it to be a surprise.

736
00:55:17,946 --> 00:55:20,141
And actually, I just found out today.

737
00:55:20,248 --> 00:55:23,411
I can't believe it! Oh, my God!

738
00:55:23,718 --> 00:55:26,983
This is amazing. I am so proud of you.

739
00:55:31,793 --> 00:55:34,990
- I knew the hard work would pay off.
- Yeah, I know.

740
00:55:35,096 --> 00:55:39,590
So, listen, you keep this, all right?
It's yours.

741
00:56:18,673 --> 00:56:20,334
What are you doing?

742
00:56:21,443 --> 00:56:25,311
I'm just jumping up and down on my bed.

743
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:31,414
What? You never did that
when you were a kid?

744
00:56:31,519 --> 00:56:34,010
- No. Not really, never.
- No.

745
00:56:35,023 --> 00:56:36,149
Right.

746
00:56:39,427 --> 00:56:40,587
All right.

747
00:56:40,695 --> 00:56:43,129
So where were you this weekend?
I tried calling you, like, 15 times.

748
00:56:43,231 --> 00:56:46,894
Oh, yeah? I ended up
having to go to New Hampshire

749
00:56:47,001 --> 00:56:49,401
to help my cousin move.

750
00:56:49,504 --> 00:56:51,438
You didn't bring your cell phone?

751
00:56:51,539 --> 00:56:54,269
Your cell? Your phone?
You didn't bring that?

752
00:56:54,375 --> 00:56:59,677
No, I forgot it. I ended up leaving it here.
So, you know.

753
00:56:59,781 --> 00:57:02,147
Yeah, well, you missed
a hell of a dorm party on Saturday.

754
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:03,478
Oh, yeah?

755
00:57:03,585 --> 00:57:05,815
We almost had a girl there.

756
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:11,352
- Republik?
- Yes.

757
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:12,884
Let's do it!

758
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:23,794
She is an eight.

759
00:57:24,138 --> 00:57:28,575
- No way. She's a 7.649.
- I was rounding up.

760
00:57:28,676 --> 00:57:31,645
Hey, I thought we agreed
we weren't gonna round up anymore.

761
00:57:31,746 --> 00:57:33,270
That's right.

762
00:57:34,148 --> 00:57:38,084
But if we win the 2.09, I'm asking her out.

763
00:57:46,327 --> 00:57:49,160
Wait. Ben? Ben, you only owe eight bucks.

764
00:57:56,170 --> 00:57:58,570
Hey. Can I get you a beer?

765
00:58:00,475 --> 00:58:03,273
- Sure.
- Yeah? Okay.

766
00:58:07,549 --> 00:58:10,040
Excuse me. Can I get two Bud Lights?

767
00:58:10,485 --> 00:58:11,577
Hey.

768
00:58:16,424 --> 00:58:18,289
- How you doing?
- I'm okay.

769
00:58:18,393 --> 00:58:19,883
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

770
00:58:20,762 --> 00:58:22,059
Thank you.

771
00:58:28,236 --> 00:58:30,602
Are those your friends over there?

772
00:58:34,175 --> 00:58:38,339
No. No, I've never seen them before
in my life.

773
00:58:39,814 --> 00:58:42,510
Could you just excuse me for one second?

774
00:58:44,819 --> 00:58:47,879
Guys, I'm serious.
What are you doing? You're staring.

775
00:58:47,989 --> 00:58:49,047
Yeah, we know.

776
00:58:49,157 --> 00:58:50,181
Yeah, well, can you not?

777
00:58:50,291 --> 00:58:52,054
I think it's gonna freak her out a bit,
don't you think?

778
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:55,789
Yeah, I got a feeling we're a little
more freaked out than she is right now.

779
00:58:55,897 --> 00:58:57,558
So how do you know her?

780
00:58:57,665 --> 00:59:01,157
Did you, like, take some self-help seminar
or something?

781
00:59:02,236 --> 00:59:03,294
What?

782
00:59:03,805 --> 00:59:07,366
- Jedi mind trick, huh?
- Jedi mind trick. Like that Luke.

783
00:59:07,642 --> 00:59:10,634
- You will drink beer.
- Right. Right, right.

784
00:59:10,745 --> 00:59:13,839
There is a fortune on the table now,
and it's all up to my dad.

785
00:59:13,948 --> 00:59:15,540
It's getting ridiculous.

786
00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:19,211
He actually needs to stop the table play,
track down my uncle and take a loan.

787
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:20,787
- No, are you serious?
- Yeah.

788
00:59:20,888 --> 00:59:22,879
They let him, and he does.

789
00:59:23,658 --> 00:59:26,525
He ends up with, like, two 19s and two 20s.

790
00:59:27,195 --> 00:59:29,686
The dealer turns over a 17.

791
00:59:29,797 --> 00:59:31,526
It's soft. He needs to take another card.

792
00:59:31,633 --> 00:59:33,999
No. Don't say a four. Is it a four?

793
00:59:34,102 --> 00:59:36,900
- It's a four, yeah.
- It's a four. My God.

794
00:59:38,239 --> 00:59:40,537
Not a great Christmas that year.

795
00:59:43,077 --> 00:59:46,535
So, what does he think about what you do?
Does he know?

796
00:59:47,115 --> 00:59:49,276
Oh, no, he's long gone, Ben.

797
00:59:51,853 --> 00:59:53,650
My dad's gone, too.

798
01:00:06,601 --> 01:00:10,901
So, you know, when you came into the store
to ask me to join the team,

799
01:00:11,739 --> 01:00:13,400
was that because...

800
01:00:13,808 --> 01:00:15,002
What?

801
01:00:15,343 --> 01:00:18,676
Well, you know,
was it because Micky asked you to?

802
01:00:21,816 --> 01:00:24,944
Look, we've had three classes together.

803
01:00:25,953 --> 01:00:28,922
You gave that presentation
on combinatorial algorithms

804
01:00:29,023 --> 01:00:30,854
that nobody understood.

805
01:00:31,993 --> 01:00:36,191
You're the smartest person in every single
one of those classes, Ben.

806
01:00:36,297 --> 01:00:40,461
That is why you're on the team.
And that's why I came into the store.

807
01:00:41,669 --> 01:00:43,603
No, no, not so much...

808
01:00:43,705 --> 01:00:46,572
- Oh, God. I'm so, so sorry.
- No. It's fine.

809
01:00:46,674 --> 01:00:49,108
- It's not a problem.
- I don't know why I just did that.

810
01:00:49,210 --> 01:00:50,438
- Don't apologize.
- Are you sure?

811
01:00:50,545 --> 01:00:53,105
Yes. Shit, this is my stop.

812
01:00:53,214 --> 01:00:55,614
- You're getting off here?
- Yeah, I've gotta get off.

813
01:00:55,717 --> 01:00:58,413
But, really, don't worry about it.

814
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:02,283
I don't know,
it's just 'cause we've been drinking, and...

815
01:01:02,390 --> 01:01:04,881
It's just we're on a team, we work together.

816
01:01:04,992 --> 01:01:07,426
- I get it.
- Just don't feel bad about this.

817
01:01:07,528 --> 01:01:10,053
Okay. Sure. Bye.

818
01:01:30,184 --> 01:01:33,915
<i>My world was flashing by
at a million miles a minute.</i>

819
01:01:35,256 --> 01:01:38,225
<i>I had saved over $100,000.</i>

820
01:01:39,393 --> 01:01:41,452
<i>Only $200,000 to go.</i>

821
01:01:42,663 --> 01:01:46,599
<i>But there was still one thing
I couldn't get off my mind.</i>

822
01:01:57,011 --> 01:01:58,706
<i>The moment we left campus,</i>

823
01:01:58,813 --> 01:02:01,077
<i>the concept of vectors and formulas</i>

824
01:02:01,182 --> 01:02:03,878
<i>were replaced with counting,
shuffle tracking</i>

825
01:02:03,985 --> 01:02:07,148
<i>knowing when to hit
and knowing when to color out.</i>

826
01:02:07,388 --> 01:02:09,982
<i>I was becoming a pro on all levels.</i>

827
01:02:10,458 --> 01:02:12,255
<i>I made more money in one trip to Vegas</i>

828
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:17,764
<i>than I would have in 5 years, 9 months,
12 days and 6 hours at J. Press Menswear.</i>

829
01:02:20,134 --> 01:02:22,602
<i>In Boston, I was just Ben Campbell.</i>

830
01:02:23,638 --> 01:02:27,369
<i>But in Vegas, I could be anyone I wanted.</i>

831
01:02:27,475 --> 01:02:29,773
You know what I'm gonna do?
You know what I'm gonna do?

832
01:02:29,877 --> 01:02:33,142
I'm gonna throw a half-mill down
on the one hand. Come on. Hit me!

833
01:02:33,247 --> 01:02:36,478
<i>One night, I'd be the high-rolling heir
to a pharmaceutical fortune.</i>

834
01:02:36,584 --> 01:02:39,712
Leon, could you make sure
there's some champagne,

835
01:02:40,121 --> 01:02:43,784
maybe some strawberries
waiting in there for me.

836
01:02:44,292 --> 01:02:45,623
I may not be alone.

837
01:02:45,726 --> 01:02:49,355
<i>The next, I'd be the hottest video game
designer on the West Coast.</i>

838
01:02:49,964 --> 01:02:51,363
There it is.

839
01:02:51,465 --> 01:02:54,957
Winner, winner, chicken dinner!

840
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:01,201
No, please, keep going.
This video's priceless.

841
01:03:02,710 --> 01:03:04,337
<i>I'm not gonna lie.</i>

842
01:03:05,046 --> 01:03:09,540
<i>It did get, well, a little confusing sometimes.</i>

843
01:03:10,484 --> 01:03:12,076
<i>Operator, how can I help you?</i>

844
01:03:12,186 --> 01:03:14,484
Yeah, room service.

845
01:03:14,589 --> 01:03:17,023
<i>Excuse me?
Honey, we don't do room service.</i>

846
01:03:17,124 --> 01:03:18,785
What do you mean,
you don't do room service?

847
01:03:18,893 --> 01:03:21,259
<i>I mean, we don't do room service.</i>

848
01:03:33,307 --> 01:03:35,969
<i>In Boston, we had a secret.</i>

849
01:03:41,749 --> 01:03:44,843
<i>In Vegas, we had a life.</i>

850

<i>Micky said I was gonna have more fun
than I could possibly imagine.</i>

851
01:03:58,933 --> 01:04:00,491
<i>And he was right.</i>

852
01:04:04,472 --> 01:04:06,531
- Hey, Jamie. There you go.
- Nice.

853
01:04:06,641 --> 01:04:08,336
<i>It was too good to be true.</i>

854
01:04:08,442 --> 01:04:12,469
There you go. All right,
my night just got better. Thank you, Joe.

855
01:04:13,547 --> 01:04:16,414
<i>And it felt like it was never going to end.</i>

856
01:04:26,794 --> 01:04:29,888
Clark? I think I got something over here.

857
01:04:30,598 --> 01:04:32,293
Take a look at this.

858
01:04:34,802 --> 01:04:37,270
That guy? He's a kid.

859
01:04:37,371 --> 01:04:41,102
He was on the tape from last week.
Got a big roll and he's crushing your table.

860
01:04:41,208 --> 01:04:43,574
Plus, he ordered a tonic and lime.

861
01:04:43,678 --> 01:04:46,374
Tonic and lime. What does that mean?

862
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:48,710
It means he wants you
to think he's drinking.

863
01:04:48,816 --> 01:04:52,115
Okay. So is he counting
or is he just getting lucky?

864
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:54,254
He's not running a progressive system.

865
01:04:54,355 --> 01:04:57,552
He doubled on 10 when the deck was heavy,
but he didn't on 11 when it got lighter.

866
01:04:57,658 --> 01:05:00,286
- How can you tell if it's heavy or light?
- I'm counting.

867
01:05:00,394 --> 01:05:01,554
You...

868
01:05:04,899 --> 01:05:06,696
Tell me something, Cole,
if you can count that well,

869
01:05:06,801 --> 01:05:08,530
why are you still consulting for us?

870
01:05:08,636 --> 01:05:10,103
I've been asking myself the same thing.

871
01:05:10,204 --> 01:05:13,640
Let's just say I like being
on your side of the hustle.

872
01:05:14,075 --> 01:05:17,067
Bring up a frame of that for me
on the printer.

873
01:05:20,581 --> 01:05:23,072
So, Terry, I heard
you guys are losing a lot of work

874
01:05:23,184 --> 01:05:26,210
to that biometric facial recognition software.

875
01:05:27,788 --> 01:05:31,383
Just gives us a little bit more time
to focus on you guys.

876
01:05:33,928 --> 01:05:36,658
- That's impressive software.
- They do.

877
01:05:37,331 --> 01:05:38,662
Here he is.

878
01:05:41,002 --> 01:05:44,062
I still think there're bigger fish
to fry out there.

879
01:05:44,171 --> 01:05:45,502
So do I.

880
01:05:53,381 --> 01:05:54,973
Hey, Fisher.

881
01:05:55,082 --> 01:05:57,141
He's mad at me and jealous of you.

882
01:05:57,251 --> 01:05:59,742
But don't worry.
Greatness evokes that reaction sometimes.

883
01:05:59,854 --> 01:06:02,789
- Don't worry about it. I gotta go.
- All right.

884
01:06:11,665 --> 01:06:13,633
- Hey.
- What's going on?

885
01:06:14,869 --> 01:06:18,498
He just didn't like the subject
I chose for my final paper.

886
01:06:18,606 --> 01:06:20,233
- That's bullshit, Ben.
- What?

887
01:06:20,341 --> 01:06:22,275
I know when you're lying,
I'm your best friend.

888
01:06:22,376 --> 01:06:24,401
At least I thought I was.

889
01:06:25,546 --> 01:06:27,138
Are you on drugs, Ben?

890
01:06:27,248 --> 01:06:29,182
Because there's a group that meets
at Simpson Hall on Saturdays.

891
01:06:29,283 --> 01:06:31,217
No, no. Cam, I'm not on drugs, okay?

892
01:06:31,318 --> 01:06:34,082
I'll go to the meeting if you need me to.

893
01:06:34,688 --> 01:06:37,418
Why didn't you tell me you quit J. Press?

894
01:06:38,893 --> 01:06:40,326
I don't know.

895
01:06:40,795 --> 01:06:43,025
- Is it Jill Taylor?
- No.

896
01:06:45,199 --> 01:06:46,860
What about Harvard?

897
01:06:48,335 --> 01:06:50,997
It'll find a way of working itself out.

898
01:06:51,705 --> 01:06:54,299
Look, I gotta go. I'll see you.

899
01:07:06,587 --> 01:07:10,683
<i>I think the worst part of it
was not being able to tell anyone.</i>

900
01:07:14,862 --> 01:07:18,992
<i>But for the first time in my life,
the world made itself easy for me.</i>

901
01:07:20,634 --> 01:07:21,760
Here you go, sir.

902
01:07:21,869 --> 01:07:23,427
<i>And I liked it.</i>

903
01:07:24,138 --> 01:07:25,605
That's for you.

904
01:07:27,875 --> 01:07:32,209
We just made $210,000.

905
01:07:32,313 --> 01:07:33,371
Yes.

906
01:07:33,481 --> 01:07:35,972
Now, Ben, this is how we play!

907
01:07:38,619 --> 01:07:41,053
<i>And play we did.</i>

908
01:07:45,292 --> 01:07:47,385
<i>Nothing cost too much.</i>

909
01:07:47,495 --> 01:07:50,020
<i>Nothing was out of reach.</i>

910
01:07:55,669 --> 01:07:58,502
<i>I guess you could say
the casino host of fate</i>

911
01:07:58,606 --> 01:08:01,200
<i>gave Ben Campbell a major upgrade.</i>

912
01:08:04,178 --> 01:08:07,045
<i>Dorm rooms turned into high-roller suites.</i>

913
01:08:08,716 --> 01:08:11,241
<i>Bicycles became stretch limos.</i>

914
01:08:14,889 --> 01:08:16,322
No, no!

915
01:08:19,627 --> 01:08:24,087
<i>And college bars that were always filled
with frat dudes were upgraded to,</i>

916
01:08:24,932 --> 01:08:28,834
<i>well, something more interesting.</i>

917
01:09:22,690 --> 01:09:26,456
- Hey, baby. Where you in from?
- I'm from Boston.

918
01:09:27,728 --> 01:09:31,630
- On a convention?
- No, business, actually.

919
01:09:33,834 --> 01:09:36,200
What line of work you in, mister?

920
01:09:36,937 --> 01:09:38,700
I count things.

921
01:09:40,874 --> 01:09:42,466
My name's Sierra.

922
01:09:43,043 --> 01:09:48,276
Hi, Sierra. I'm Salvador Sanchez.

923
01:09:50,284 --> 01:09:53,048
Would you like a private dance, Salvador?

924
01:09:54,655 --> 01:09:58,557
Well, that all depends
on how much it's gonna run me, Sierra.

925
01:10:01,061 --> 01:10:03,689
$20 a song, 30-song minimum.

926
01:10:05,566 --> 01:10:07,158
Sounds expensive.

927
01:10:26,220 --> 01:10:30,680
- Good evening, Mr. Klein.
- Hey, Frank. It's good to see you.

928
01:10:30,791 --> 01:10:33,282
Jeffrey, you're taking my money.

929
01:10:34,395 --> 01:10:36,363
You are so lucky you're cute.

930
01:10:36,463 --> 01:10:39,159
'Cause if you weren't cute, I'd leave.
You know that?

931
01:10:39,266 --> 01:10:42,827
Jeffrey. My brother from another mother.

932
01:10:43,404 --> 01:10:44,496
How you doing? You good?

933
01:10:44,605 --> 01:10:47,802
I'm good, I'm good, Mr. K.
What, are you back in town for business?

934
01:10:47,908 --> 01:10:53,039
- It's all business in this town, right?
- Well, with your money, I'm sure it always is.

935
01:10:53,947 --> 01:10:55,881
Oh, damn, I forgot my ring.

936
01:10:55,983 --> 01:10:57,883
Oh, please.

937
01:11:04,658 --> 01:11:07,923
I don't wanna bet that. That's for keep.

938
01:11:08,262 --> 01:11:09,957
$100,000 going out.

939
01:11:12,333 --> 01:11:13,994
Thank you, Jeffrey.

940
01:11:21,208 --> 01:11:23,267
Cole. Your boy's back.

941
01:11:27,281 --> 01:11:28,839
- That's him, right?
- There he is.

942
01:11:28,949 --> 01:11:31,975
And he brought
a whole lot more money with him.

943
01:11:39,126 --> 01:11:41,686
That is a hell of a suit, by the way.

944
01:11:57,277 --> 01:12:01,509
- That is some aftershave he has going on.
- Sir, could you not? Please.

945
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:09,887
This girl's only betting the table minimum.
Why's she keep looking at him?

946
01:12:09,990 --> 01:12:14,689
Terry, rewind the tape. I wanna see
if she signals him to come to the table.

947
01:12:16,096 --> 01:12:19,691
<i>We don't use " tape" anymore, old school.
It's digital now.</i>

948
01:12:22,102 --> 01:12:24,263
Never mind. Terry, rewind it.

949
01:12:27,141 --> 01:12:28,665
Okay, okay.

950
01:12:29,410 --> 01:12:31,071
She's playing the table minimum.

951
01:12:31,178 --> 01:12:33,339
Now, in a second,
she's gonna do something.

952
01:12:33,447 --> 01:12:37,315
She's gonna raise her hand,
scratch her head... There it is.

953
01:12:38,485 --> 01:12:41,420
That's the signal. See?
She gave him the signal.

954
01:12:41,522 --> 01:12:44,855
He comes to the table.
I'm telling you, they're working together.

955
01:12:44,958 --> 01:12:46,016
Nice.

956
01:12:47,694 --> 01:12:50,254
Show me a computer that can do that.

957
01:12:55,102 --> 01:12:56,729
You look familiar.

958
01:12:58,038 --> 01:12:59,801
I know you, don't I?

959
01:13:01,408 --> 01:13:03,239
- I don't think so.
- No?

960
01:13:03,777 --> 01:13:08,043
<i>Oh, sure, you look exactly like that guy
in Rain Man.</i>

961
01:13:10,384 --> 01:13:13,217
Oh, yeah? Well, people say
I look like Tom Cruise all the time.

962
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:15,015
Oh, yeah? No.

963
01:13:16,123 --> 01:13:19,786
The other one, the... What's his... The retard.

964
01:13:20,794 --> 01:13:26,027
I just love that scene in Vegas
when the retard wins at blackjack.

965
01:13:26,967 --> 01:13:28,901
You look just like that.

966
01:13:32,773 --> 01:13:39,645
What I could never understand, though,
is how someone so retarded,

967
01:13:40,547 --> 01:13:42,242
could win so much.

968
01:13:44,618 --> 01:13:48,110
Hey, Jeffrey,
his brother from another mother,

969
01:13:48,222 --> 01:13:49,985
how did that retard win so much?

970
01:13:50,090 --> 01:13:53,025
- You know what, sir? I think that maybe...
- Okay, get your hands off me.

971
01:13:53,126 --> 01:13:55,321
Oh, I didn't mean it.

972
01:14:29,530 --> 01:14:32,727
His luck'll run out eventually.
It always does.

973
01:14:43,110 --> 01:14:45,340
- Hey, Ben...
- No, Ben, stop it!

974
01:14:45,445 --> 01:14:47,310
- What the hell is the matter with you?
- Hey, come on! Ben!

975
01:14:47,414 --> 01:14:50,872
Oh, you think that's funny?
You think that was funny? Shut up!

976
01:14:50,984 --> 01:14:52,349
I understand, Ben. We don't need anymore...

977
01:14:52,452 --> 01:14:54,283
This is not the time. Okay?

978
01:14:54,388 --> 01:14:57,186
I want to thank you
for confirming my choice in Ben.

979
01:14:57,291 --> 01:14:58,656
Now go home.

980
01:15:05,032 --> 01:15:07,023
- What?
- You're off the team.

981
01:15:07,134 --> 01:15:08,192
No.

982
01:15:09,202 --> 01:15:12,569
- I was drunk, I was...
- I don't care what you were.

983
01:15:13,807 --> 01:15:15,104
I'm not leaving.

984
01:15:15,208 --> 01:15:17,733
Yes, you are.

985
01:15:18,245 --> 01:15:20,713
What are you gonna do about it, huh?

986
01:15:24,585 --> 01:15:28,453
You've been the big man for a long time,
but you just acted like a child.

987
01:15:28,555 --> 01:15:31,683
So I want you to pick up the ticket
and go home,

988
01:15:31,792 --> 01:15:35,819
because if you don't,
you know exactly what I'm capable of doing,

989
01:15:36,430 --> 01:15:37,727
don't you?

990
01:15:54,982 --> 01:15:55,971
All right, listen up.

991
01:15:56,083 --> 01:15:59,610
Casino's gonna change out their chips,
just like the MGM did after the Tyson fight.

992
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:02,587
That means we got less than 24 hours
to cash in,

993
01:16:02,689 --> 01:16:04,953
or we're gonna be sitting
with 200 grand of worthless plastic.

994
01:16:05,058 --> 01:16:07,288
- So we'll cash out.
- It's too hot.

995
01:16:07,394 --> 01:16:11,296
They're gonna be dissecting the eye in
the sky footage of Fisher's little power play.

996
01:16:11,398 --> 01:16:13,593
So let's do it right now
before they can do that.

997
01:16:13,700 --> 01:16:15,668
Are you deliberately slow?

998
01:16:16,503 --> 01:16:18,061
What about them?

999
01:16:19,439 --> 01:16:20,997
What about them?

1000
01:16:21,108 --> 01:16:25,408
They can cash in the chips.
The casino's just gonna think they're tips.

1001
01:16:32,853 --> 01:16:34,286
- Cashing out.
- Thank you.

1002
01:16:34,388 --> 01:16:36,481
- Thank you.
- Thanks, sweetie.

1003
01:16:37,090 --> 01:16:39,524
- Thanks, hon.
- Thank you, baby.

1004
01:16:44,197 --> 01:16:46,256
I love a parade, don't you?

1005
01:16:47,434 --> 01:16:51,200
You know, there's a word
I don't throw around all that often,

1006
01:16:51,805 --> 01:16:53,033
<i>" Genius."</i>

1007
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:24,561
Hey, Kianna.
Let me hold your bag for a second.

1008
01:17:25,272 --> 01:17:26,534
Thanks, baby, here.

1009
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:28,130
Oh, no problem. Anytime.

1010
01:17:28,241 --> 01:17:31,142
- Watch. Watch, watch. Ready?
- Okay, I'm watching. That's beautiful.

1011
01:17:31,244 --> 01:17:32,233
Watch.

1012
01:17:32,345 --> 01:17:36,076
No, it's great, you just need
to get your knee a little higher.

1013
01:17:58,238 --> 01:17:59,762
- Hi.
- Hey.

1014
01:18:01,141 --> 01:18:03,575
So the Hard Rock comped me a suite.

1015
01:18:04,811 --> 01:18:06,779
That's cool, that's great.

1016
01:18:09,850 --> 01:18:11,545
You wanna see it?

1017
01:19:13,914 --> 01:19:16,576
All right, take care, Bobby. All right?

1018
01:19:37,070 --> 01:19:38,594
God, it's cold.

1019
01:19:39,039 --> 01:19:40,939
Hey, what time is it?

1020
01:19:41,908 --> 01:19:45,071
He's only 45 minutes late.
Show a little patience.

1021
01:19:46,479 --> 01:19:48,538
Oh, look. Here he comes.

1022
01:19:49,349 --> 01:19:51,340
Guys, I'm sorry I'm late.

1023
01:19:51,451 --> 01:19:52,679
Hey, Ben.

1024
01:19:52,953 --> 01:19:54,750
You know, you could try
returning a call once in a while.

1025
01:19:54,855 --> 01:19:57,016
Good of you to show up, man.
It's not like we're cold or anything.

1026
01:19:57,123 --> 01:19:58,488
Yeah, funny.

1027
01:19:59,793 --> 01:20:03,422
- Hey, did you bring it?
- Yeah, I got it. There it is.

1028
01:20:03,530 --> 01:20:06,465
And you're sure
you didn't inlay the software on more space

1029
01:20:06,566 --> 01:20:07,760
than the parameters suggest?

1030
01:20:07,868 --> 01:20:09,893
No. It's just one-fifth of the free face.

1031
01:20:10,003 --> 01:20:11,994
Let's fire this mother up.

1032
01:20:12,105 --> 01:20:13,367
Beautiful.

1033
01:20:22,215 --> 01:20:23,443
Okay.

1034
01:20:23,984 --> 01:20:25,076
Okay.

1035
01:20:28,588 --> 01:20:30,180
What's happening?

1036
01:20:33,526 --> 01:20:36,051
- I don't understand.
- It's the wrong size.

1037
01:20:36,162 --> 01:20:37,424
No. What?

1038
01:20:38,498 --> 01:20:41,797
- What the hell, Ben? This is an 8K.
- Right.

1039
01:20:43,470 --> 01:20:45,370
Yeah, we needed 16K!

1040
01:20:46,806 --> 01:20:50,606
- I can't believe this.
- I thought it was an 8K.

1041
01:20:50,710 --> 01:20:52,302
- No, you didn't.
- Yeah, I did.

1042
01:20:52,412 --> 01:20:56,644
No, you didn't. You knew the entire time
the discrete was 16K.

1043
01:20:57,150 --> 01:20:58,412
Damn it, Ben.

1044
01:20:58,518 --> 01:21:01,783
It's gonna take us two weeks
to get a fresh 16K from the fabrication.

1045
01:21:01,888 --> 01:21:05,289
And another five days, minimum,
to get it ready to press.

1046
01:21:05,392 --> 01:21:08,828
Miles, calm down, all right?
It was an honest mistake.

1047
01:21:11,464 --> 01:21:12,761
What?

1048
01:21:15,101 --> 01:21:19,868
You know what? I think we're gonna have
to go at this without you, man.

1049
01:21:20,974 --> 01:21:22,669
You're gonna what?

1050
01:21:25,512 --> 01:21:29,107
No, no.
This is just as much mine as it is yours.

1051
01:21:29,215 --> 01:21:31,809
We've been working on this for over a year.

1052
01:21:31,918 --> 01:21:35,479
I know that.
But your heart just isn't in this anymore.

1053
01:21:41,261 --> 01:21:42,819
Are you serious?

1054
01:21:49,536 --> 01:21:50,560
Fine.

1055
01:21:52,405 --> 01:21:53,497
Fine.

1056
01:21:54,908 --> 01:21:59,140
You know what? I don't even care.
Honestly, I don't even care.

1057
01:21:59,245 --> 01:22:00,473
You know why?

1058
01:22:00,580 --> 01:22:04,949
'Cause no one in the real world gives a shit
about the 2.09 Competition.

1059
01:22:06,052 --> 01:22:07,917
You know, it's just something
that you build up in your head

1060
01:22:08,021 --> 01:22:10,012
to make yourselves feel important.

1061
01:22:10,123 --> 01:22:12,023
You guys are pathetic.

1062
01:22:12,125 --> 01:22:13,285
Thanks.

1063
01:22:20,266 --> 01:22:21,665
Welcome back, Mr. Youngman.

1064
01:22:21,768 --> 01:22:25,534
- Thanks, Joseph. It's good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

1065
01:22:29,175 --> 01:22:32,167
Good evening, Mr. Youngman,
welcome back to the Red Rock.

1066
01:22:32,278 --> 01:22:33,745
Nice to see you.

1067
01:22:33,847 --> 01:22:36,509
Anything I can do for you, let me know.

1068
01:22:54,067 --> 01:22:55,432
Double down.

1069
01:23:31,171 --> 01:23:34,197
I guess you play big or you don't play at all.

1070
01:23:35,408 --> 01:23:36,636
Right?

1071
01:23:39,145 --> 01:23:43,172
Honey, there you are. Let's go.
We don't wanna miss the show!

1072
01:23:43,283 --> 01:23:46,081
Honey, we're actually playing a game here.

1073
01:23:46,553 --> 01:23:47,645
Yeah.

1074
01:23:48,054 --> 01:23:49,817
Yeah, so you know what?

1075
01:23:49,923 --> 01:23:53,984
Why don't you run upstairs
and wait for me there? Okay?

1076
01:23:56,596 --> 01:23:58,427
All right. Let's go.

1077
01:24:03,603 --> 01:24:05,594
Yeah, all right.

1078
01:24:06,206 --> 01:24:08,800
I've got the worst headache right now.

1079
01:24:22,822 --> 01:24:24,653
- Ten.
- Come on, monkey.

1080
01:24:24,757 --> 01:24:27,123
- Fourteen.
- Come on. Come on, monkey.

1081
01:24:27,227 --> 01:24:29,354
- Sixteen.
- Monkey. Come on.

1082
01:24:30,663 --> 01:24:32,096
Twenty-one.

1083
01:24:38,538 --> 01:24:40,472
Pete, you're killing us.

1084
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:55,711
I guess it's not my night.

1085
01:25:20,647 --> 01:25:22,774
Are you out of your mind?

1086
01:25:24,150 --> 01:25:26,175
I don't know what happened.

1087
01:25:26,452 --> 01:25:29,080
I messed up. I'm sorry.

1088
01:25:30,256 --> 01:25:31,484
Oh, you're sorry.

1089
01:25:31,591 --> 01:25:35,186
Well, see, now that's what I've been waiting
to hear, Ben. As long as you're sorry.

1090
01:25:35,295 --> 01:25:39,857
I'm out 200 grand, but Ben's sorry!
Everybody hear that? Ben's sorry!

1091
01:25:39,966 --> 01:25:44,027
So we can all go back to being friends
and laughing over cocktails!

1092
01:25:45,238 --> 01:25:46,603
Come on, Micky. It can happen to anyone.

1093
01:25:46,706 --> 01:25:48,139
They get on a rush and they lose control.

1094
01:25:48,241 --> 01:25:49,868
You shut your mouth. This is business.

1095
01:25:49,976 --> 01:25:53,343
Hey, I let you down, all right? I get it.

1096
01:25:53,446 --> 01:25:57,280
Excuse me? You let me down? I don't care!

1097
01:25:57,917 --> 01:26:01,045
Let me make one thing clear to you,
I am not your father!

1098
01:26:01,154 --> 01:26:04,180
You are not my friend. This is a business.

1099
01:26:04,457 --> 01:26:06,584
You are only as good to me
as the money you make,

1100
01:26:06,693 --> 01:26:08,388
and, right now, it's not worth a hell of a lot!

1101
01:26:08,494 --> 01:26:10,223
You're gonna give me back
everything you lost.

1102
01:26:10,330 --> 01:26:13,094
I can't do that! That money was for Harvard!

1103
01:26:13,199 --> 01:26:15,099
I have made you so much more
than what I just lost!

1104
01:26:15,201 --> 01:26:17,032
It doesn't matter, Ben.

1105
01:26:17,136 --> 01:26:20,264
You had very clear instructions,
and you didn't follow them.

1106
01:26:20,373 --> 01:26:24,309
You didn't do your job.
You weren't counting, you were gambling!

1107
01:26:26,846 --> 01:26:29,747
Well, why aren't you out there, then, Micky?

1108
01:26:30,316 --> 01:26:35,015
I mean, we take all the risks.
Seems to me like you don't do shit.

1109
01:26:39,726 --> 01:26:41,660
This isn't about me,

1110
01:26:42,495 --> 01:26:46,192
you arrogant little infant.

1111
01:26:59,112 --> 01:27:01,740
You can all find your own way
back to Boston.

1112
01:27:01,848 --> 01:27:05,909
And, Ben, you're gonna pay me that money,
every penny, one way or the other.

1113
01:27:06,019 --> 01:27:08,010
And you damn well know it.

1114
01:27:18,097 --> 01:27:19,587
I need a drink.

1115
01:27:22,435 --> 01:27:23,868
Anybody else?

1116
01:27:26,906 --> 01:27:28,635
Yeah, well, we don't need him.

1117
01:27:28,741 --> 01:27:30,402
- Yeah, okay, Ben.
- No, I'm serious.

1118
01:27:30,510 --> 01:27:33,172
Why do we need him?
We have our own money now.

1119
01:27:33,279 --> 01:27:36,544
You know, his cut was 50%,
and he doesn't even play!

1120
01:27:37,116 --> 01:27:38,276
Why do we need him?

1121
01:27:38,384 --> 01:27:39,476
Hey, you know what I think?

1122
01:27:39,585 --> 01:27:42,918
I think we play out the weekend,
and I think we do this without him.

1123
01:27:43,022 --> 01:27:44,421
No. No, I don't think that's a good idea.

1124
01:27:44,524 --> 01:27:46,754
I think we should go back to Boston
and figure this out.

1125
01:27:46,859 --> 01:27:48,656
Yeah, well,
why don't we let the team decide?

1126
01:27:48,761 --> 01:27:51,889
I'm with Jill. This is Micky's thing.
Micky brought us together.

1127
01:27:51,998 --> 01:27:53,989
And then he drove us apart.

1128
01:27:54,100 --> 01:27:57,126
I mean, you saw
how he played Fisher against me.

1129
01:27:58,071 --> 01:28:01,700
Choi, what do you say, man?
You wanna make some money?

1130
01:28:03,209 --> 01:28:04,870
- Kind of.
- Really?

1131
01:28:05,645 --> 01:28:08,910
We need 100 grand just to play.
You're talking about risking our own money.

1132
01:28:09,015 --> 01:28:12,178
All I'm saying is that we try it. You know?

1133
01:28:12,285 --> 01:28:16,085
If we make the investment,
then we take all of the winnings.

1134
01:28:17,156 --> 01:28:18,453
All of it.

1135
01:28:25,598 --> 01:28:26,895
Okay.

1136
01:28:31,204 --> 01:28:32,262
Yeah.

1137
01:28:32,739 --> 01:28:34,798
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1138
01:28:36,542 --> 01:28:37,736
Choi?

1139
01:28:39,112 --> 01:28:40,374
I'm in.

1140
01:28:42,248 --> 01:28:43,943
Now I need a drink.

1141
01:28:49,922 --> 01:28:51,685
- What are you doing?
- What?

1142
01:28:51,791 --> 01:28:53,759
What are you doing?

1143
01:28:53,860 --> 01:28:55,919
Well, we're printing money.

1144
01:28:56,362 --> 01:28:59,058
What, you think just 'cause Micky left
that we're gonna stop?

1145
01:28:59,165 --> 01:29:01,963
No, I could do this. I can lead this team.

1146
01:29:02,335 --> 01:29:05,600
You know, I'm not the same guy
I was back in Boston.

1147
01:29:06,072 --> 01:29:08,302
- Exactly.
- Yeah, exactly.

1148
01:29:08,808 --> 01:29:11,436
You know, isn't this exactly
who you wanted me to be

1149
01:29:11,544 --> 01:29:14,536
when you first came into the store
to buy a tie?

1150
01:29:18,818 --> 01:29:21,480
<i>What happened to " $300,000 and I'm out"?</i>

1151
01:29:22,422 --> 01:29:25,118
<i>What happened to " a means to an end"?</i>

1152
01:29:26,058 --> 01:29:28,891
- How much do you have?
- What?

1153
01:29:28,995 --> 01:29:31,190
- How much do you have?
- I got enough.

1154
01:29:31,297 --> 01:29:33,527
Come on, Ben. How much do you have
saved back in Boston?

1155
01:29:33,633 --> 01:29:36,158
I've got 315 grand, all right?

1156
01:29:36,536 --> 01:29:38,834
Then why are you still here?

1157
01:29:40,173 --> 01:29:44,132
Because I wanna still be here.
I like being here.

1158
01:29:44,577 --> 01:29:46,442
So does everybody else.

1159
01:29:46,846 --> 01:29:49,542
So come on, Jill. Are you in?

1160
01:29:55,421 --> 01:29:58,185
You are the big player, Ben.

1161
01:29:58,291 --> 01:29:59,656
Yes, I am.

1162
01:30:02,094 --> 01:30:03,994
Yeah, can I get a drink?

1163
01:30:31,924 --> 01:30:33,858
Rose, I wanna thank you.

1164
01:30:34,894 --> 01:30:37,260
You have been most accommodating.

1165
01:30:37,830 --> 01:30:39,798
All right, that's for you.

1166
01:30:40,099 --> 01:30:42,397
Okay, take care. Hey, good luck.

1167
01:30:49,976 --> 01:30:51,967
Hey, how we doing here, people?

1168
01:31:03,289 --> 01:31:06,690
Yeah, I'm gonna put you on hold
while I track him down.

1169
01:31:10,296 --> 01:31:12,423
Just got an interesting call.

1170
01:31:14,534 --> 01:31:18,595
There's nobody left to fire us.
Planet Hollywood is our last client.

1171
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:22,940
I don't know about that.

1172
01:31:28,581 --> 01:31:30,014
This is Cole.

1173
01:31:40,793 --> 01:31:43,591
Queen of diamonds. Your lady luck tonight.

1174
01:31:44,096 --> 01:31:45,723
You're doing good.

1175
01:31:46,032 --> 01:31:47,795
You're a real winner.

1176
01:31:52,572 --> 01:31:55,268
Sometimes. Just like everybody else.

1177
01:31:56,342 --> 01:31:58,537
Now, why don't I believe that?

1178
01:32:00,646 --> 01:32:02,705
Maybe you're just smarter
than everybody else, huh?

1179
01:32:02,815 --> 01:32:05,477
Yeah, I bet it's been that way your entire life.

1180
01:32:05,585 --> 01:32:09,351
Except it just recently started
paying dividends, am I right?

1181
01:32:11,090 --> 01:32:12,455
I'd split them.

1182
01:32:12,558 --> 01:32:16,995
Deck's heavy as hell and since
I've been here, the true count's at plus 7.

1183
01:32:23,803 --> 01:32:25,896
Kianna. I think
we have a serious problem over there.

1184
01:32:26,005 --> 01:32:27,472
- Walk now!
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit!

1185
01:32:27,573 --> 01:32:30,633
Let's go. I'm out. Thank you.
Let's go, Jill. Let's go.

1186
01:32:30,743 --> 01:32:32,472
I think we need
to call security or something.

1187
01:32:32,578 --> 01:32:36,173
Yeah, I don't think they're gonna help.
Let's go! Come on.

1188
01:32:40,786 --> 01:32:42,754
Let's take a walk, huh?

1189
01:32:43,489 --> 01:32:47,255
Come on, kid.
See if we can't get you that chicken dinner.

1190
01:32:52,431 --> 01:32:55,025
It's called Biometrics.

1191
01:32:55,134 --> 01:32:59,366
Biometrics.
It's sort of like a fingerprint of your face.

1192
01:33:02,008 --> 01:33:07,241
See, when the player sits down
at the table, the software, it reads this...

1193
01:33:07,346 --> 01:33:08,813
Biometric profile.

1194
01:33:08,914 --> 01:33:10,677
...biometric profile of your face,

1195
01:33:10,783 --> 01:33:13,809
cross-references it
with a database of counters.

1196
01:33:17,356 --> 01:33:22,157
Software'll probably put you and me
out of business, but it still can't do this.

1197
01:33:25,331 --> 01:33:26,628
All right.

1198
01:33:32,204 --> 01:33:35,071
You understand all this. You go to MIT.

1199
01:33:35,441 --> 01:33:36,840
Smart boy.

1200
01:33:38,310 --> 01:33:40,244
My name is Cole Williams.

1201
01:33:40,846 --> 01:33:44,111
And if I ever see you in this town again,

1202
01:33:44,884 --> 01:33:48,285
I will break your cheek bone
with a small hammer,

1203
01:33:49,522 --> 01:33:51,513
and then I will kill you.

1204
01:33:56,195 --> 01:33:59,756
Please. Please just take the money.

1205
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:02,524
You can take it.

1206
01:34:05,237 --> 01:34:06,568
Tell me,

1207
01:34:07,139 --> 01:34:11,872
how's good old Professor Rosa doing, huh?

1208
01:34:13,546 --> 01:34:18,142
Oh, yeah. Me and Micky, we go way back.

1209
01:34:19,251 --> 01:34:22,243
I spent years, chased him all over this town.

1210
01:34:22,688 --> 01:34:27,648
Giving him beat downs left and right,
only to find him at the tables a week later.

1211
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:29,728
He was very persistent.

1212
01:34:30,629 --> 01:34:33,928
And then, one September night,

1213
01:34:34,433 --> 01:34:37,334
when I was in Barstow
at my father's funeral,

1214
01:34:38,204 --> 01:34:41,640
my casino was taken for seven figures.

1215
01:34:41,741 --> 01:34:43,072
Can you imagine that?

1216
01:34:43,175 --> 01:34:46,406
The most ever taken by a single counter
in one night.

1217
01:34:46,512 --> 01:34:51,108
'Course I was, naturally,
unceremoniously fired.

1218
01:34:53,819 --> 01:34:55,582
Funny thing, though.

1219
01:34:55,988 --> 01:34:58,513
I never saw Micky Rosa after that.

1220
01:34:59,692 --> 01:35:00,818
Never.

1221
01:36:27,546 --> 01:36:29,673
<i>Cauchy was the first
to make a rigorous study</i>

1222
01:36:29,782 --> 01:36:33,809
of the conditions for convergence
of an infinite series.

1223
01:36:33,919 --> 01:36:36,217
And was concerned with developing

1224
01:36:36,322 --> 01:36:41,191
the basic theorems of the calculus
as rigorously as possible.

1225
01:36:42,595 --> 01:36:44,028
Any questions?

1226
01:36:44,430 --> 01:36:46,557
No? All right, moving on.

1227
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:51,593
Isn't it true Cauchy stole from his students?

1228
01:36:56,508 --> 01:37:00,376
Yes, I heard that.
What's your theory on that?

1229
01:37:01,413 --> 01:37:05,941
They say he used his students
for their brilliance,

1230
01:37:07,086 --> 01:37:11,318
then discredited them
and stole their equations,

1231
01:37:13,392 --> 01:37:15,257
stole their hard work.

1232
01:37:17,963 --> 01:37:20,659
Well, that wouldn't be the first time
a teacher was accused of that.

1233
01:37:20,766 --> 01:37:25,465
I think what he's referring to
is Vladimir Stupnitsky, yes?

1234
01:37:25,571 --> 01:37:28,506
He was a student of Cauchy's
who accused Cauchy

1235
01:37:28,607 --> 01:37:31,940
of stealing his four-volume text
on this analysis

1236
01:37:32,044 --> 01:37:34,512
and publishing it under a pseudonym.

1237
01:37:36,348 --> 01:37:38,009
Of course, nobody knows
what really went down there.

1238
01:37:38,117 --> 01:37:42,110
They never did prove it, and without
the proof, it's a little like it never happened.

1239
01:37:42,221 --> 01:37:44,246
And, you know, it's a real shame,

1240
01:37:44,356 --> 01:37:48,554
because if Stupnitsky had just realized
that he shouldn't have crossed Cauchy,

1241
01:37:48,661 --> 01:37:50,390
this was the dispute,

1242
01:37:51,430 --> 01:37:57,426
if he'd been able to get beyond some
of the personal mistakes that were made,

1243
01:37:57,970 --> 01:38:01,201
I have no doubt that Cauchy
would have worked with him again,

1244
01:38:01,307 --> 01:38:04,333
and they could have
done great things together.

1245
01:38:04,743 --> 01:38:08,804
But, as history shows us,
some students never learn.

1246
01:38:10,516 --> 01:38:12,177
You should get that eye looked at.

1247
01:38:49,388 --> 01:38:50,787
You okay?

1248
01:38:53,759 --> 01:38:55,386
Everything's gone.

1249
01:38:57,196 --> 01:38:59,790
- What?
- Micky's taken everything.

1250
01:38:59,898 --> 01:39:04,130
He's taken the money,
taken away Harvard Med, even MIT.

1251
01:39:06,005 --> 01:39:08,098
- What are you talking about?
- Micky, he's taken everything.

1252
01:39:08,207 --> 01:39:10,607
I gotta find a way to get it back.

1253
01:39:11,910 --> 01:39:13,400
Are you insane?

1254
01:39:14,013 --> 01:39:17,574
You just got the shit kicked out of you
and you won't let this go!

1255
01:39:17,683 --> 01:39:21,619
Look, what am I supposed to do, Jill?
I've just lost everything!

1256
01:39:22,388 --> 01:39:23,878
Look, please...

1257
01:39:25,691 --> 01:39:27,955
I don't want to lose you, too.

1258
01:39:30,963 --> 01:39:34,558
Ben, you were dragged away in Vegas.

1259
01:39:35,234 --> 01:39:39,568
I haven't heard from you.
I had no idea where you were.

1260
01:39:40,272 --> 01:39:41,500
I know.

1261
01:39:42,474 --> 01:39:43,634
I know.

1262
01:39:50,983 --> 01:39:53,781
You know, I'm so sorry that I hurt you.

1263
01:39:55,587 --> 01:39:56,952
I'm sorry.

1264
01:39:59,825 --> 01:40:04,319
In Vegas, I don't know what happened.
That wasn't me.

1265
01:40:05,531 --> 01:40:07,158
Look, you know me.

1266
01:40:07,866 --> 01:40:09,731
You know what I'm like.

1267
01:40:11,537 --> 01:40:13,027
You know me.

1268
01:40:19,478 --> 01:40:21,343
I need you to trust me.

1269
01:40:22,681 --> 01:40:26,048
<i>And the winner of this year's 2.09</i>

1270
01:40:26,151 --> 01:40:32,420
<i>for excellence in the field of robotics
goes to the team of Conolly and Kazazi!</i>

1271
01:41:09,795 --> 01:41:12,764
That's it. That's the story.

1272
01:41:15,267 --> 01:41:17,497
Jill Taylor. Really?

1273
01:41:18,303 --> 01:41:21,795
- Yeah. Yeah, really.
- Wow.

1274
01:41:21,907 --> 01:41:26,105
<i>Yeah, it doesn't feel like " wow," Miles.
I really screwed up.</i>

1275
01:41:26,211 --> 01:41:30,944
Yeah, you did.
But you had a life experience.

1276
01:41:35,387 --> 01:41:37,378
I can't believe how I treated you, Miles.

1277
01:41:37,489 --> 01:41:41,391
You know, you're my best friend,
and I really let you down.

1278
01:41:42,261 --> 01:41:45,355
I really let you down. I'm sorry.

1279
01:41:47,166 --> 01:41:51,694
And I'm happy for you, you know?
Winning the 2.09? That's great.

1280
01:41:53,071 --> 01:41:55,539
- Jill Taylor. Really?
- Yeah.

1281
01:41:58,076 --> 01:42:00,169
So let me get this straight.

1282
01:42:00,846 --> 01:42:04,009
Money, girls,

1283
01:42:05,184 --> 01:42:09,587
high-roller suites, clubs, Vegas.

1284
01:42:10,789 --> 01:42:15,817
Yeah, I think I probably would have
blown off the 2.09 Competition, too.

1285
01:42:19,364 --> 01:42:20,729
So we cool?

1286
01:42:22,367 --> 01:42:23,959
Yeah, we're cool.

1287
01:42:24,469 --> 01:42:27,165
But you better believe that
you're gonna make this up to me, big time.

1288
01:42:27,272 --> 01:42:28,534
All right.

1289
01:42:29,841 --> 01:42:31,968
So, what are you gonna do now?

1290
01:43:22,761 --> 01:43:24,592
What do you want, Ben?
This is an alumni dinner.

1291
01:43:24,696 --> 01:43:27,062
You need a diploma
to come to one of these.

1292
01:43:27,165 --> 01:43:29,565
Wait. Stupnitsky wants back in.

1293
01:43:35,774 --> 01:43:36,741
What?

1294
01:43:36,842 --> 01:43:40,972
Look, I've had some time
to think about what you said.

1295
01:43:42,848 --> 01:43:44,338
I want back in.

1296
01:43:45,317 --> 01:43:49,185
- Why now?
- Because I have nothing else.

1297
01:43:51,056 --> 01:43:54,253
All right, look, Ben. I'm not gonna lie to you.
You're good, you're very, very good.

1298
01:43:54,359 --> 01:43:58,523
But you did exactly what I told you not to.
You got emotional and then you got stupid.

1299
01:43:58,630 --> 01:44:02,327
Now you tell me why in the world
I'd ever get back in business with you.

1300
01:44:02,434 --> 01:44:06,894
Look, I know I should never have
disrespected you, all right? I know that.

1301
01:44:07,873 --> 01:44:09,841
With this facial recognition software,

1302
01:44:09,941 --> 01:44:13,138
our window of opportunity
is closing in on us.

1303
01:44:13,679 --> 01:44:17,342
Now, I need this, Micky.
I really, really need this.

1304
01:44:17,449 --> 01:44:22,580
Well, the take would have to be really, really
good to get me even vaguely interested.

1305
01:44:24,089 --> 01:44:29,391
Well, you know, that's why I was thinking
maybe you should be the other big player.

1306
01:44:30,796 --> 01:44:34,129
You know, two big players playing big?

1307
01:44:35,300 --> 01:44:38,633
Hey, slow down,
I haven't played in a long time, Ben.

1308
01:44:43,075 --> 01:44:44,667
But Fisher's out.

1309
01:44:45,544 --> 01:44:49,913
No one else on the team
can be the big player, can they?

1310
01:44:53,151 --> 01:44:56,552
And if we do well, if we do really well,

1311
01:44:57,322 --> 01:45:00,485
then you get your grades back,
get to Harvard Med,

1312
01:45:01,493 --> 01:45:04,018
and I might even get that sabbatical.

1313
01:45:05,030 --> 01:45:09,490
Well, amazing things can be done
from the inside, right?

1314
01:45:11,436 --> 01:45:14,132
Just went back to the head of the class.

1315
01:45:15,407 --> 01:45:17,272
I gotta go be social.

1316
01:45:22,647 --> 01:45:25,946
All right, now listen.
It's different out there this time.

1317
01:45:26,051 --> 01:45:28,918
The stakes are high
and it's more dangerous.

1318
01:45:29,454 --> 01:45:32,514
But the return is gonna be the biggest.

1319
01:45:33,825 --> 01:45:37,261
Now they know our faces,
so we're gonna wear disguises.

1320
01:45:37,496 --> 01:45:39,464
And we can't mess around.

1321
01:45:39,831 --> 01:45:41,298
I'm glad you're back with us, Micky.

1322
01:45:41,400 --> 01:45:43,300
Well, I couldn't let you guys
come back to this town

1323
01:45:43,402 --> 01:45:46,894
and not prove to Ben
that I can do more than just teach.

1324
01:45:47,739 --> 01:45:51,641
But as we've all said, this game
is about the past and the future,

1325
01:45:51,743 --> 01:45:54,803
and tonight we forget about the past.

1326
01:45:55,046 --> 01:45:56,911
We just focus on the future.

1327
01:45:57,015 --> 01:46:00,348
Right. This is our last time.

1328
01:46:00,752 --> 01:46:03,778
Now, we all know the drill if things get ugly.
We meet at the Fox Strip Club.

1329
01:46:03,889 --> 01:46:06,221
Nobody leaves this town alone.

1330
01:46:09,694 --> 01:46:11,594
Let's go make a killing.

1331
01:46:12,130 --> 01:46:13,495
All right.

1332
01:46:35,620 --> 01:46:38,088
Let's see what we can do with this.

1333
01:46:47,199 --> 01:46:51,260
Seems like I'm having one of those days,
you know what I mean, Jim?

1334
01:46:52,938 --> 01:46:55,065
I'm bringing all the luck today.
I'm just bringing it all.

1335
01:46:55,173 --> 01:46:59,633
Anyone who's in any kind of contact
with me is getting so much luck today.

1336
01:47:11,289 --> 01:47:13,450
Winner, winner, chicken dinner! There it is.

1337
01:47:13,558 --> 01:47:16,994
Thank you. God, I love this town.
I love this game.

1338
01:47:17,796 --> 01:47:21,095
And, Jim, I might even love you.

1339
01:47:30,909 --> 01:47:33,104
Hey, you mind if I sit down?

1340
01:47:47,125 --> 01:47:48,183
What's your name?

1341
01:47:48,293 --> 01:47:51,421
Shane? I'm about to change your luck.
It's gonna become mine.

1342
01:47:51,530 --> 01:47:53,760
There you go, give me it all.

1343
01:48:03,808 --> 01:48:05,002
There you go.

1344
01:48:07,779 --> 01:48:09,542
Thank you. Thank you.

1345
01:48:14,286 --> 01:48:16,516
Such a shame, Shane!

1346
01:48:17,489 --> 01:48:19,548
Okay, I'm supposed to double, right?

1347
01:48:19,658 --> 01:48:23,992
- Is this your first time, darling?
- I've been winning and losing for hours.

1348
01:48:24,095 --> 01:48:26,188
Well, that's all right.
I've been winning and losing for years.

1349
01:48:39,511 --> 01:48:41,035
What the hell kind of streak
are you on, boy?

1350
01:48:41,146 --> 01:48:43,808
This never happens, this never happens.

1351
01:48:56,861 --> 01:48:58,658
I'm just gonna have to split those tens.

1352
01:48:58,763 --> 01:49:00,321
- Splitting tens.
- Splitting tens!

1353
01:49:00,432 --> 01:49:01,566
- Split tens!
- Again!

1354
01:49:01,566 --> 01:49:02,294
- Split tens!
- Again!

1355
01:49:25,223 --> 01:49:28,192
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Give me the chips, Blanca.

1356
01:49:29,427 --> 01:49:31,292
Give me the chips!
Come on, give me the chips, Blanca.

1357
01:49:31,396 --> 01:49:34,297
Come on, just give me the chips!

1358
01:49:34,399 --> 01:49:38,529
- My bus has to leave right away.
- I gotta walk my dog.

1359
01:49:38,637 --> 01:49:41,197
- I'm sorry we're making such a mess.
- Go, go, go, go, go.

1360
01:49:41,306 --> 01:49:44,366
Nice to see you. Have a good night, darling.

1361
01:49:49,914 --> 01:49:51,211
This way!

1362
01:50:02,427 --> 01:50:03,519
Go.

1363
01:50:17,876 --> 01:50:19,241
This way!

1364
01:50:25,150 --> 01:50:27,141
Come on, Jill. Come on!

1365
01:50:37,062 --> 01:50:39,656
Go that way. Throw me the chips.
Come on, we gotta separate.

1366
01:50:39,764 --> 01:50:42,631
Give me the chips, I'll meet you at Fox's.

1367
01:50:48,707 --> 01:50:50,299
Go, go, go, go!

1368
01:51:01,252 --> 01:51:02,913
Come on, come on.

1369
01:51:06,024 --> 01:51:07,582
Move, move, move!

1370
01:51:11,763 --> 01:51:13,025
Come on.

1371
01:51:14,165 --> 01:51:15,757
Go, go, this way.

1372
01:51:27,746 --> 01:51:29,577
All right, let's go.

1373
01:51:37,655 --> 01:51:40,146
Go, go, go, go! Airport!

1374
01:51:58,710 --> 01:52:00,337
<i>I never saw Micky Rosa after that.</i>

1375
01:52:05,416 --> 01:52:06,678
Oh, God.

1376
01:52:07,786 --> 01:52:10,050
But I think I wanna see him now.

1377
01:52:11,122 --> 01:52:13,590
And I want you to make that happen.

1378
01:52:17,862 --> 01:52:20,296
I don't work for Micky anymore.

1379
01:52:23,301 --> 01:52:24,734
Come on, kid.

1380
01:52:26,571 --> 01:52:30,337
Your picture's all over the database.
Your Vegas gig is done.

1381
01:52:31,376 --> 01:52:33,310
But I will give you one night.

1382
01:52:33,411 --> 01:52:36,471
And I can guarantee
that you won't be bothered.

1383
01:52:37,382 --> 01:52:41,148
You'll make a killing, and you'll keep it all.

1384
01:52:44,222 --> 01:52:45,416
Listen.

1385
01:52:46,991 --> 01:52:48,458
My name's Cole.

1386
01:52:50,028 --> 01:52:51,552
Cole Williams.

1387
01:52:53,464 --> 01:52:55,864
You just bring me Micky Rosa, kid.

1388
01:52:56,167 --> 01:52:58,192
I'll take care of the rest.

1389
01:53:00,738 --> 01:53:03,673
Son of a bitch.

1390
01:53:46,317 --> 01:53:48,080
Who the hell are you?

1391
01:54:10,942 --> 01:54:14,105
Ben. Good job.

1392
01:54:15,179 --> 01:54:20,242
You'll be glad to know I'm gonna have a talk
with your professor, and that MIT thing?

1393
01:54:20,451 --> 01:54:22,544
It's gonna work out for you.

1394
01:54:24,122 --> 01:54:25,680
So that's it?

1395
01:54:27,125 --> 01:54:29,889
- That's it.
- All right.

1396
01:54:30,862 --> 01:54:32,557
Oh, Dr. Campbell?

1397
01:54:33,898 --> 01:54:36,867
They don't have pensions
in my line of work.

1398
01:54:37,201 --> 01:54:39,101
And the software does
what it's supposed to do.

1399
01:54:39,203 --> 01:54:43,105
And I been chasing Micky Rosa around here
for too damn long.

1400
01:54:44,342 --> 01:54:46,606
I'm looking at some retirement.

1401
01:54:48,513 --> 01:54:49,980
Leave the bag.

1402
01:54:52,050 --> 01:54:54,348
No. No, no, no, no.

1403
01:54:54,452 --> 01:54:58,946
I need this money. You have no idea
what I went through to get this money.

1404
01:54:59,057 --> 01:55:04,051
I know, kid, but you're gonna figure out
how to get everything you want in this life,

1405
01:55:04,162 --> 01:55:05,891
'cause you're smart.

1406
01:55:07,465 --> 01:55:11,993
So, you're gonna leave the bag.

1407
01:55:17,041 --> 01:55:21,637
Ben, give him the bag. Give him the bag.
It doesn't matter. Give him the bag.

1408
01:55:30,488 --> 01:55:32,285
I knew you were smart.

1409
01:55:51,142 --> 01:55:53,872
<i>I had a 1590 on my SAT.</i>

1410
01:55:53,978 --> 01:55:56,037
<i>I got a 44 on my MCATs.</i>

1411
01:55:56,547 --> 01:55:59,675
<i>And I have a 4.0 GPA from MIT.</i>

1412
01:55:59,784 --> 01:56:02,252
<i>I thought I had my life mapped out.</i>

1413
01:56:04,155 --> 01:56:05,247
<i>But then I remembered</i>

1414
01:56:05,356 --> 01:56:08,814
<i>what my Nonlinear Equations professor
once told me,</i>

1415
01:56:09,360 --> 01:56:12,591
<i>"Always account for variable change."</i>

1416
01:56:14,399 --> 01:56:15,923
Hello, Micky.

1417
01:56:17,635 --> 01:56:19,466
Look, I got money in Boston.
A hundred grand.

1418
01:56:19,570 --> 01:56:21,595
I'll give it to you.
Just let me walk away. I'll walk away.

1419
01:56:21,706 --> 01:56:24,766
I don't want your money, Micky.
I don't need it.

1420
01:56:30,581 --> 01:56:33,379
But I know someone
who might be interested.

1421
01:56:33,751 --> 01:56:37,847
He's good with numbers, too.
He works for the IRS.

1422
01:56:46,664 --> 01:56:48,723
<i>I let down my good friends.</i>

1423
01:56:49,400 --> 01:56:54,337
<i>But as it turns out,
they weren't too bad at simple math either.</i>

1424
01:57:20,164 --> 01:57:22,724
<i>I scored the prettiest girl in school.</i>

1425
01:57:26,204 --> 01:57:28,832
<i>I got beaten down
by an old-school Vegas thug</i>

1426
01:57:28,940 --> 01:57:32,137
<i>who was having trouble
accepting his retirement.</i>

1427
01:57:33,444 --> 01:57:37,210
<i>But I worked out a deal with him
that got him a nice pension.</i>

1428
01:57:40,585 --> 01:57:43,383
<i>And I lied to my mother.</i>

1429
01:57:43,855 --> 01:57:47,552
<i>But I confessed the lie,
and, well, she still loved me.</i>

1430
01:58:04,075 --> 01:58:07,340
<i>So my senior year of college,
I joined this team.</i>

1431
01:58:07,745 --> 01:58:09,906
<i>And I learned this new skill.</i>

1432
01:58:10,148 --> 01:58:13,174
<i>I went to Vegas 17 times to use it.</i>

1433
01:58:15,353 --> 01:58:18,880
<i>I made hundreds of thousands of dollars
counting cards.</i>

1434
01:58:19,924 --> 01:58:22,484
And then I had it all stolen from me.

1435
01:58:23,427 --> 01:58:24,587
Twice.

1436
01:58:25,897 --> 01:58:29,993
How's that for life experience, professor?
Did I dazzle you?

1437
01:58:31,169 --> 01:58:34,007
Did I jump off the page?

1438
01:59:34,008 --> 01:59:35,008
