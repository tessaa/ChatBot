triumph is being spoiled

Yes.

I must escape this place.

Where are you going to run,

him.

No, Victor.

has come for me
to take command of him.

What are you saying?

20
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,755
Why do you think
I brought you here?
Gave you this castle?

21
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,132
Equipped your laboratory?

23
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:17,136

believed in my work.

And I do.

25

He is the key.

35
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,190
I could never allow him
to be used for such evil.

Our story
begins 450 years ago

139
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:07,632
when
a Transylvanian knight,
named Valerious the Elder,

140
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:11,219
promised God that his family
would never rest nor enter
heaven

141
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:14,347
until they vanquished
Dracula from their land.

142
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,849
They have
not succeeded

143
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,978
and they are
running out of family.

144
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:25,191
His descendant
Boris Valerious,
King of the Gypsies.

145
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,902
He disappeared
almost 12 months ago.

146
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:34,325
His only son, Prince Velkan,
and his daughter,
Princess Anna.

147
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,954
If the two of them are killed
before Dracula is vanquished,

148
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:42,792
nine generations of their
family will never enter
the gates of St. Peter.

149
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,336
For more than
four centuries

150
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:48,006
this family has
defended our left flank.

151
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,924
They gave their lives.

152
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:53,511
We cannot let them
slip into purgatory.

153
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:55,930
So you're
sending me into hell.

154
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,559
In a manner.

155
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:06,274
Valerious the Elder left
this here 400 years ago.

156
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,693
We don't know its purpose

157
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:11,362
but he would not
have left it lightly.

158
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:14,073
The Latin
inscription
translates as,

159
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:17,660
"In the name of God,
open this door."

160
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:20,288
There is an insignia.

161
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:27,003
Yes, it matches your ring.

162

There you are.

168

Did you
bring Mr. Hyde back,
or did you kill him?

169
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:53,696
You killed him,
didn't you?

170

That's why
they get so annoyed.

to bring someone
back,

172

they don't mean
as a corpse.

Here, take this.

179
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:14,342
Rings of garlic, holy water,

180

have one of those?

You've never
gone after vampires
before now, have you?

183
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:29,982
Vampires,
gargoyles, warlocks,
they're all the same.

184
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,067
Best when cooked well.

185

No, they're
not all the same.

186

A vampire is
nothing like a warlock.

It's gas-propelled.

199

Capable of
catapulting arrows
in rapid succession

Just pull
the trigger and hold on.

202
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,899
I've heard the stories
from Transylvania.

203
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,317
Trust me,
you'll need this.

204
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,986
A work of
certifiable genius.

205
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,404
If you don't say so yourself.

206
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,197
No, I did say so myself.

207
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,158
I'm a veritable
cornucopia of talent.

208
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,742
Did you invent this?

209
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,661
I've been working
on that for 1 2 years.

210
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:25,580
It's compressed
magma from Mt. Vesuvius

211
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,707
with pure alkaline
from the Gobi Desert.

What's it for?

214
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,670
I don't know, but I'm
sure it'll come in handy.

215
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,881
12 years, and you
don't know what it does?

216
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:37,675
I didn't say that.
I said I didn't
know what it's for.

217
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:40,136
What it does is to
create a light source

218
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,846
equal to
the intensity of the sun.

219
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,514
This will come in handy how?

220

You can blind

Not very well,
but you're a monk.
You shouldn't curse at all.

228

Actually,
I'm still just a friar.

MAN 2: You killed Marishka!

MAN 3: You killed a vampire!

328
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:38,200
But isn't that
a good thing?

329
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:41,203
Vampires only kill
what they need to
survive.

330
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:43,330
One or two
people a month.

331
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:46,875
Now they will
kill for revenge.

Are you always this popular?

334
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:53,799
Pretty much.

335
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:58,303
So what name,
my good sir, do I
carve on your gravestone?

336
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:00,472
His name is Van Helsing.

Your reputation
precedes you.

Next time stay close.
You're no good to me dead.

340
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:19,991
Well, I'll say this for you.

341
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,576
You've got courage.

342
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,580
He's the first one to kill
a vampire in over 100 years.

343
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:28,416
I'd say that's
earned him a drink.

344
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:35,715
Marishka!

DRACULA:
Why can't they
just leave us alone?

We never kill
more than our fill
and less than our share.

347
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:53,817
Can they say the same?

348
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:59,948
Did I not stress how important
it was to be finished with
Anna Valerious

349
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:03,702
before she destroys
what we are trying

There, there, my darlings.
Do not worry.

353
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:12,627
I shall find another bride.

354
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,004
What?

355
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:17,007
Do we mean
so little to you?

356
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:19,176
Have you no heart?

357
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:23,597
No, I have no heart!
I feel no love!

358
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:25,765
Nor fear,

359

nor joy,

nor sorrow!

361
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:35,692
I am hollow.

362
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,782
And I will live forever.

363
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,409
My Lord.

364
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:46,578

battle will begin.

367

(GROWLING)

369

You will have to make
a little apéritif out
of him.

370
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:13,730
We are much
too close to success

00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,671
Come.

00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:41,633
Do not fear me.

00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:43,885
Everybody else fears me.

379
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,888
Not my brides.

380
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:52,102
Igor.

381
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:55,188
Yes, Master.

382
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:58,525
Why do you
torment that thing so?

383
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,819
It's what I do.

384
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:03,613
Remember, Igor,
"Do unto others. . ."

385
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:07,993
Before they do
unto me, Master.

386
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:11,162
Now go, all of you !

387
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:14,040
To Castle Frankenstein !

388
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:19,087
ALEERA:
Yes, we will try again.

389
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,384
So, how did you get here?

390
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:25,677
We came by sea.

391
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:26,761
ANNA: Really? The sea?

392
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:27,804
CARL: Well, yes.

393
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:29,180
ANNA: The Adriatic Sea?

394
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:30,974
VAN HELSlNG:
So, where do
I find Dracula?

395
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:34,060
ANNA: He used to live in this
very house four centuries ago.

396
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:36,104
No one knows
where he lives now.

397
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:38,273
Father would stare at
that painting for hours

398
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:40,025
looking for Dracula's lair.

399
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,818
So that's why you've come?

400
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:43,320
I can help you.

401
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:44,863
No one can help me.

402
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:46,114
I can try.

403
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:49,200
You can die trying.
All of my family has.

404
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:50,785
I can handle this myself.

405
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,162
So I noticed.

406
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:53,788
The vampires
attacked in daylight.

407
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:54,873
They never do that.

408
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:57,334
I was unprepared.
It won't happen again.

409
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:59,169
So why did they
attack in daylight?

410
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:01,546
Clearly they wanted
to catch me off guard.

411
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,923
They seem
almost desperate to
finish off my family.

412
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,842
Why is that? Why now?

413
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:07,469
You ask a lot of questions.

414
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:08,928
Usually I ask only two.

415
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,847
What are
we dealing with?
How do I kill it?

416
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:12,265
My father spent
most of his life

417
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,142
looking for
answers year after year.

418
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:17,729
Tearing through the tower,
combing through the
family archives.

419
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:19,064
Carl, the tower. Start there.

420
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:20,190
Right.

421
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:23,693
The only way to save your
family is to stay alive
till Dracula's killed.

422
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:25,862
And who will
kill him if not me?

423
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:27,364
Who will show
courage if not me?

424
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:29,949
Go alone and you'll be
outmanned and outpositioned.

425
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,868
And you can't
see in the dark.

426
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:34,454
In the morning,
we will hunt him

427
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:37,290
but we'll do it together.

428
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:46,174
Some say you're a murderer,
Mr. Van Helsing.

429
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:50,470
Others say you're a holy man.
Which is it?

430
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:56,142
It's a bit of both, I think.

431
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:01,231
I promised you a drink.

432
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:02,816
Yes, you did.

433
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,902
The bar is down the hall.
Help yourself.

434
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:09,364
As for me,
I'm going to finish
this once and for all.

435
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,242
I'm sorry you have to
carry this burden alone.

436
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:14,536
On the contrary,
I would wish for
it no other way.

437
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,371
I'm sorry about your
father and brother.

438
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:18,081
I will see them again.

439
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:20,875
We Transylvanians always look
on the brighter side of death.

440
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,585
There's
a brighter
side of death?

441
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,505
Yes. It's just harder to see.

442
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,264
I'm sorry about that, too.

443
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:48,862
Van Helsing !

444
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:01,374
Van Helsing?

445
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:22,812

Velkan?
Anna.

Oh, my God, you're alive.

449
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:35,903
No. Anna,
I only have a moment.

450
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:37,739
But there's a werewolf. . .
Never mind ! Listen to me!

451
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:40,283
I know Dracula's secret.
He has a. . .

452
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:47,874
Velkan?
Please.

453
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:50,877
No!

(GRUNTING)

455
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:20,073
Run, Anna.

456
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:39,759
VAN HELSING: Anna!

457
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:47,642
Are you all right?

458
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:02,990
(SNIFFING)

459
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:05,743
Why does it smell
like wet dog in here?

460
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:07,036
Werewolf!

461
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:09,122
Right.
You'll be needing
silver bullets, then.

462
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,581
Well done.

463
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:01,132
Who's hunting whom?

464
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:13,519
Nice night.
This is a bit
tight for me.

465
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:17,690
But for you
it's a perfect fit.

466
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:20,902
What a coincidence.

467
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:24,071
I see the wolf man
hasn't killed you yet.

468
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:25,990
Don't worry,
he's getting to it.

469
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:27,450
You don't seem
too bothered by him.

470
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:29,118
I'm no threat to him.

471
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:32,121
I'm just the one who
cleans up after him,

472
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:34,123
if you get my meaning.

473
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,292
Little late to be
digging graves,
isn't it?

474
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:38,628
Never too late
to dig graves.

475
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:43,716
You never know when
you'll need a fresh one.

476
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:50,556
Oh, sorry.
It's just my nature.

477
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:04,403
ANNA: No.

478
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:09,617
VAN HELSING: Move!
ANNA: No!

479
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:15,248
Why?

480
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:16,874
You're choking me!

481
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:18,918
Give me a reason not to.

482
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:22,004
I can't. If people knew. . .

483
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:27,593
He's not your
brother anymore, Anna!

484
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:30,012
You knew?

485
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:31,764
Yes.

486
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:36,227
Before
or after I stopped
you from shooting him?

tried to kill him !

that your father went
missing.

Yes. He was
looking for Dracula.

way to the sea.

And I am soon to
take it to my grave.

Don't wish for
death so quickly.

So would you like me to
refresh your memory
a little?

648
01:03:55,122 --> 01:03:57,791
A few details
from your sordid past.

649
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:11,096
Perhaps that is a conversation
for another time.

650
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:16,935
Allow me to
reintroduce myself.

651
01:04:17,603 --> 01:04:22,566
I am Count
Vladislaus Dragulia.

652
01:04:24,485 --> 01:04:27,028
Born 1422.

653
01:04:28,155 --> 01:04:31,783
Murdered 1462.

654
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:46,965
Help me!

655
01:05:14,994 --> 01:05:16,786
(BOTH SCREAMING)

656
01:05:35,222 --> 01:05:37,807
I think we've
overstayed our welcome.

657
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:25,563
MAN 1 :
Have you found the children?

658
01:06:25,731 --> 01:06:26,940
MAN 2: Not yet.

659
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:32,320
What happened?

660
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:34,030
They just died.

661
01:06:38,703 --> 01:06:40,745
How can I ever repay you?

662
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:50,839
But you can't do that.
You are a monk.

663
01:06:50,923 --> 01:06:53,258
Well,
actually I'm just a friar.

664
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:59,556
I am sorry, master.
We try and we try,

665
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:04,185
but I fear we
are not so smart
as Dr. Frankenstein.

666
01:07:04,937 --> 01:07:06,062
Truly.

667
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:11,276
It would appear the good
doctor took the key to
life to his grave.

668
01:07:16,574 --> 01:07:18,116
Hunt them down.

669
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:22,287
Kill them both.

670
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:27,751
ANNA: A silver stake?
A crucifix?

671
01:07:28,169 --> 01:07:30,712
What,
did you think we haven't
tried everything before?

672
01:07:30,796 --> 01:07:33,506
We've shot him,
stabbed him, clubbed him,

673
01:07:33,591 --> 01:07:35,800
sprayed him with holy water,
staked him through the heart,

674
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:38,178
and still he lives!
Do you understand?

675
01:07:38,262 --> 01:07:40,096
No one knows how
to kill Dracula.

676
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:43,808
Well,
I could have used that
information a little earlier.

677
01:07:44,143 --> 01:07:46,144
Don't give me that look.

678
01:07:50,566 --> 01:07:53,443
You were right. I'm sorry.

679
01:07:54,236 --> 01:07:56,404
He's not my brother anymore.

680
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:13,880
Do you have any family,
Mr. Van Helsing?

681
01:08:15,633 --> 01:08:18,176
Not sure.
I hope to find out someday.

682
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:20,386
That's what keeps me going.

683
01:08:21,847 --> 01:08:23,306
Here's to what
keeps you going.

684
01:08:23,390 --> 01:08:25,475
Absinthe. Strong stuff.

685
01:08:29,730 --> 01:08:33,149
Don't let it
touch your tongue.
It'll knock you on your. . .

686
01:08:53,254 --> 01:08:54,504
Vampire.

687
01:08:57,842 --> 01:08:59,134
Vampires!

(EXCLAIMING IN FRIGHT)

689
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:07,851
Now I remember.

690
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:24,159
"Even a man
who is pure in heart
And says his prayers by night

691
01:09:24,910 --> 01:09:29,289
"May become a wolf

692

"And the moon

01:09:36,088 --> 01:09:38,339
"And his body
takes to flight"

695
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:54,063
(WOMAN SCREAMING)

696
01:10:18,297 --> 01:10:20,465
There's something down here.

697
01:10:22,843 --> 01:10:24,719
And it's carnivorous.

698
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:31,100
Whatever it is,
it appears to be human.

699
01:10:35,314 --> 01:10:39,984
I'd say
he's a size 17.
Around 360 pounds.

700
01:10:40,819 --> 01:10:43,029
8.5 to 9 feet tall.

701
01:10:43,739 --> 01:10:48,117
He has a bad
gimp in his right leg
and three copper teeth.

702
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:50,161
How do you know
he has copper teeth?

703
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:52,830
Because he's standing
right behind you. Move!

704
01:10:58,337 --> 01:11:01,547
Oh, my God !
The Frankenstein monster!

705
01:11:01,632 --> 01:11:04,801
Monster?
Who's the monster here?

706
01:11:06,762 --> 01:11:12,058
I have done nothing wrong
and yet you and your kind
all wish me dead !

707
01:11:33,539 --> 01:11:35,206
What do you want?

708
01:11:37,042 --> 01:11:38,710
To exist.

709
01:11:51,432 --> 01:11:52,557
Don't!

710
01:11:53,017 --> 01:11:54,183
We must kill it.
Wait.

711
01:11:54,268 --> 01:11:57,729
If you value your lives
and the lives of your kind,

712
01:11:58,272 --> 01:11:59,981
you will kill me.

713
01:12:00,065 --> 01:12:01,274
No.

714
01:12:01,692 --> 01:12:03,609
If Dracula finds me.

715
01:12:05,738 --> 01:12:09,240
I am the key to
my father's machine.

716
01:12:10,451 --> 01:12:12,076
The key to life.

717
01:12:12,911 --> 01:12:15,788
Life for Dracula's children.

718
01:12:15,873 --> 01:12:17,498
He already
awakened them last night.

719
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:19,042
Two.

720
01:12:19,126 --> 01:12:22,295
And those were
from only one bride.

721
01:12:23,756 --> 01:12:26,382
From one single birthing.

722
01:12:26,925 --> 01:12:30,094
And they died as they
did the last time
he tried.

723
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:38,186
Only with me can he
give them lasting life.

724
01:12:38,395 --> 01:12:40,938
There are more?
More of those things?

725
01:12:42,107 --> 01:12:43,441
Thousands.

726
01:12:44,943 --> 01:12:46,444
Thousands more.

727
01:13:00,125 --> 01:13:02,085
No.
You heard what he said.

728
01:13:02,169 --> 01:13:05,380
My life,
my job is to
vanquish evil.

729
01:13:05,464 --> 01:13:06,964
I can sense evil.

730
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:09,384
This thing, man,
whatever it is

731
01:13:09,468 --> 01:13:12,053
evil may have created it,
may have left its mark on it.

732
01:13:12,137 --> 01:13:15,181
But evil
does not rule it,
so I cannot kill it.

733
01:13:15,599 --> 01:13:17,725
I can.
Not while I'm here.

734
01:13:23,690 --> 01:13:25,983
Your family
has spent 400 years
trying to kill Dracula.

735
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:29,153
Maybe this poor creature
can help us find a way.

736
01:13:31,573 --> 01:13:32,573
(SOFT CLICK)

737
01:13:38,330 --> 01:13:40,957
Oh, my God. He's seen us.

738
01:13:41,708 --> 01:13:43,167
Now they'll come for him.

739
01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:45,169
Neither you nor I will
be able to stop them.

740
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:48,506
If I can get him to Rome,
we can protect him there.

741
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:51,759
And then the painting
came alive and the two
creatures attacked each other.

742
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:52,885
What does it mean?

743
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:53,928
I don't know.

744
01:13:54,012 --> 01:13:56,681
Listen, Carl,
whatever you do,
don't stare at him.

745
01:13:58,642 --> 01:14:00,768
I'm staring at him.

746
01:14:00,853 --> 01:14:02,228
Is that a man?

747
01:14:02,312 --> 01:14:03,354
Actually, it's seven men.

748
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:04,439
Parts of them, anyway.

749
01:14:04,523 --> 01:14:07,150
By exposing me,
you have condemned me!

750
01:14:07,234 --> 01:14:09,026
Me and all of humanity!

751
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:11,696
Nothing is faster
than Transylvanian horses.

752
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:13,531
Not even a werewolf.

753
01:14:13,782 --> 01:14:16,200
Anything else,
you're on your own.

754
01:14:30,549 --> 01:14:32,008
Let me go.

755
01:14:32,092 --> 01:14:33,509
Where are you
going to go?

756
01:14:33,594 --> 01:14:37,054
I don't know if you've seen
a mirror lately but you
kind of stick out in a crowd.

01:16:52,232 --> 01:16:53,399
(BOTH SCREAMING)

758
01:16:55,777 --> 01:16:58,904

the creature be
destroyed !

Save the monster!

What are you
doing out here?

ANNA: Carl !
CARL: Right.

765
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:17,566
Don't let go!

766
01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:31,956
I can help!

767
01:18:32,082 --> 01:18:33,457
You won't kill me?

768
01:18:33,542 --> 01:18:35,543
Only if you don't hurry!

Forgive me.

773
01:20:26,363 --> 01:20:28,155
I will see you again.

774
01:20:39,417 --> 01:20:41,085
You killed him.

775
01:20:43,004 --> 01:20:45,631
Now you know why
they call me murderer.

776

Oh, my God.

777
01:20:56,935 --> 01:20:58,727
You've been bitten.

778
01:21:26,631 --> 01:21:27,631
Anna.

779
01:21:52,490 --> 01:21:54,491
So much trouble
to my master.

780
01:21:54,659 --> 01:21:56,702
So much trouble.

781
01:21:57,454 --> 01:21:58,537
What do you want?

782
01:21:58,622 --> 01:22:00,831
The master commands a trade.

783
01:22:02,876 --> 01:22:06,921
The monster for the Princess.

784
01:22:07,339 --> 01:22:09,840
Somewhere public.
Lots of people.

785
01:22:12,469 --> 01:22:14,261
A place
where your master
will be less inclined

786
01:22:14,346 --> 01:22:16,639
to expose his other side.

787
01:22:19,351 --> 01:22:22,686
Tomorrow night is
All Hallows' Eve.

788
01:22:22,771 --> 01:22:27,524
Here in Budapest, there is
a wonderful masquerade ball.

(LAUGHING)

790
01:22:38,703 --> 01:22:40,245
Are you all right?
No.

791
01:22:43,833 --> 01:22:45,334
He has been bitten.

792
01:22:45,418 --> 01:22:47,211
Bitten by a werewolf.

793
01:22:48,546 --> 01:22:52,424
Now you will become that
which you have hunted
so passionately.

794
01:23:00,183 --> 01:23:01,558
I am sorry.

795
01:23:02,394 --> 01:23:06,021
May others
be as passionate in
their hunting of you.

796
01:23:11,403 --> 01:23:13,529
Well, they won't
find him in here.

797
01:23:13,905 --> 01:23:15,489
I'm sure this is
some sort of sin.

798
01:23:15,573 --> 01:23:16,949
Don't worry,
God will forgive us.

799
01:23:17,033 --> 01:23:18,325
We need to save Anna.

800
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:19,952
You don't think
the hat's a bit much?

801
01:23:20,036 --> 01:23:21,578
Carl, help me!
Right.

802
01:23:21,663 --> 01:23:24,456
How many commandments
can we break in one day?

803
01:23:24,541 --> 01:23:26,542
Anyway, according to the book

804
01:23:26,626 --> 01:23:30,004
you won't turn into a werewolf
until the rising of your first
full moon.

805
01:23:30,088 --> 01:23:31,672
That's two nights
from now.

806
01:23:31,756 --> 01:23:34,258
Even then, you'll
still be able to fight

somehow kill Dracula,

VAN HELSING:
All right, Carl,
what have you learned?

892
01:31:45,166 --> 01:31:48,502
That Count Dracula
was actually the son
of Valerious the Elder.

893
01:31:48,586 --> 01:31:49,961
The son of your ancestor.

894
01:31:50,046 --> 01:31:52,005
Everybody knows that.
What else?

895
01:31:52,089 --> 01:31:57,677
All right. Well, according to
this rubbing it all started
when Dracula was murdered.

896
01:31:57,762 --> 01:31:59,054
Do you know
who murdered him?
No,

897
01:31:59,138 --> 01:32:02,015
there's just
some vague reference
to the Left Hand of God.

898
01:32:02,099 --> 01:32:06,186
And in 1462,
when Dracula died,

899
01:32:06,270 --> 01:32:07,854
he made
a covenant
with the Devil.

900
01:32:07,939 --> 01:32:09,481
And was given a new life.

901
01:32:09,565 --> 01:32:12,442
But the only way he could
sustain that life was by
drinking blood.

902
01:32:12,527 --> 01:32:14,694
Excuse me.
Are you going to
let me tell the story?

903
01:32:14,779 --> 01:32:15,779
BOTH: Sorry.

904
01:32:15,863 --> 01:32:18,782
And your ancestor,
having sired this
evil creature,

905
01:32:18,866 --> 01:32:21,284
went to Rome to
seek forgiveness.

906
01:32:21,369 --> 01:32:23,411
That's when
the bargain
was made.

907
01:32:23,496 --> 01:32:24,663
He was to kill Dracula

908
01:32:24,747 --> 01:32:28,375
in return for
eternal salvation
of his entire family

909
01:32:28,459 --> 01:32:30,752
right down the line
all the way to you.

910
01:32:30,836 --> 01:32:32,546
ANNA: But he couldn't do it.

911
01:32:32,630 --> 01:32:35,215
As evil as
Dracula was, my ancestor
couldn't kill his own son.

912
01:32:35,299 --> 01:32:38,885
So he banished him
to an icy fortress

913
01:32:38,970 --> 01:32:41,388
sending him
through a door from
which there was no return.

914
01:32:41,472 --> 01:32:42,472
And then the Devil
gave him wings.

915
01:32:42,557 --> 01:32:43,557
Yes.

916
01:32:43,641 --> 01:32:45,141
All right,
so where is this door?

917
01:32:45,268 --> 01:32:46,810
I don't know.

918
01:32:48,020 --> 01:32:51,064
But when
your ancestor couldn't
kill his son, he left clues.

919
01:32:53,025 --> 01:32:55,860
So that
future generations
might do it for him.

920
01:32:55,945 --> 01:32:58,113
That must
be what my father
was looking for in here.

you were right.
Quite literally.

how to open it.

opened it long ago.

964
01:37:41,105 --> 01:37:43,314
My master has awakened.

965
01:38:04,461 --> 01:38:05,837
There is a cure.

966
01:38:05,921 --> 01:38:07,213
What?

967
01:38:07,298 --> 01:38:11,467
Dracula.
He has a cure to remove
the curse of the werewolf!

968
01:38:12,386 --> 01:38:16,806
Go,
find the cure!
Save yourself!

969
01:38:28,110 --> 01:38:29,903
Come on.
You heard him.
Let's find it.

970
01:38:29,987 --> 01:38:31,779
Wait. Why does
Dracula have
a cure?

971
01:38:31,864 --> 01:38:32,989
I don't care!

972
01:38:33,073 --> 01:38:34,282
I do.

973
01:38:34,867 --> 01:38:37,327
Why does he need one?
Why?

974
01:38:37,995 --> 01:38:42,206
Because the only thing
that can kill him is
a werewolf.

975
01:38:42,291 --> 01:38:43,750
The painting.
That's what it meant.

976
01:38:43,834 --> 01:38:46,836
But Dracula's been
using werewolves to do
his bidding for centuries.

977
01:38:46,921 --> 01:38:49,672
Yes, but if one ever had
the will to turn on him,
he'd need a cure

978
01:38:49,798 --> 01:38:52,967
to remove the curse and
make him human before
it bit him.

979
01:38:54,887 --> 01:38:57,263
You're going to take these
two and lead them to the
antidote.

980
01:38:57,348 --> 01:38:58,556
No, I'm not.

981
01:38:59,892 --> 01:39:01,267
Yes, I am.

982
01:39:02,102 --> 01:39:04,395
Here's
the plan. When the bell
begins to toll midnight,

983
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:05,772
you'll be able
to kill Dracula.

984
01:39:05,856 --> 01:39:08,650
We just need to find the
cure and get it into you
before the final stroke.

985
01:39:08,734 --> 01:39:10,777
Are you insane?
What kind of plan is that?

986
01:39:10,861 --> 01:39:14,072
If they even suspect
you of misleading them. . .

987
01:39:14,156 --> 01:39:15,448
Clip off one of his fingers.

988
01:39:15,532 --> 01:39:16,532
I'll clip off something.

989
01:39:16,617 --> 01:39:18,701
The tower over there,
that's where it is.

990
01:39:18,786 --> 01:39:20,286
And what about
the other tower?

991
01:39:20,371 --> 01:39:21,663
Give me that!
That is where

992
01:39:21,747 --> 01:39:23,790
we reassembled
the laboratory.

993
01:39:23,874 --> 01:39:25,375
Would I lie to you?

994
01:39:26,377 --> 01:39:27,835
Not if you wanted to live.

995
01:39:29,046 --> 01:39:32,924
Now, if I'm not
cured by the twelfth
stroke of midnight. . .

996
01:39:36,428 --> 01:39:37,637
I don't think I could.

997
01:39:37,721 --> 01:39:39,055
You must.

998
01:39:44,853 --> 01:39:46,104
Come on.

999
01:39:48,399 --> 01:39:49,649
I don't like this plan.

1000
01:39:49,733 --> 01:39:50,984
We don't have a choice.

1001
01:39:51,068 --> 01:39:52,151
Just don't get killed.

1002
01:39:52,236 --> 01:39:54,070
You still don't understand.

1003
01:39:54,154 --> 01:39:56,489
It doesn't matter
what happens to me.

1004
01:39:56,573 --> 01:39:58,533
We must save my family.

1005
01:39:58,951 --> 01:40:01,828
If you're late,
run like hell.

1006
01:40:06,083 --> 01:40:07,625
Don't be late.

1007
01:40:21,181 --> 01:40:23,725
(WHlSPERING) Now go. Go.

1008
01:40:49,418 --> 01:40:52,128
MONSTER: Get off me,
you vermin from hell !

1009
01:40:55,841 --> 01:40:59,385
What are you
complaining about?
This is why you were made!

1010
01:40:59,470 --> 01:41:03,556
To prove that God is not
the only one who can
create life!

1011
01:41:04,266 --> 01:41:08,436
And now you must give
that life to my children.

1012
01:41:08,937 --> 01:41:09,979
Up!

1013
01:42:24,471 --> 01:42:26,055
There it is.

1014
01:42:31,436 --> 01:42:33,062
I'll go first.

1015
01:42:55,419 --> 01:42:56,544
ANNA: Carl !

1016
01:42:59,214 --> 01:43:04,343
Stay as long as you like.
You try to get lgor.
Igor get you !

1017
01:43:47,346 --> 01:43:49,430
Go ahead. Grab it.

1018
01:43:49,556 --> 01:43:51,641
You go ahead and grab it.

1019
01:43:52,267 --> 01:43:54,685
If there's one thing I've
learned it's never to be
the first to stick

1020
01:43:54,770 --> 01:43:56,812
your hand in
a viscous material.

1021
01:44:03,820 --> 01:44:05,363
Did I scare you?

1022
01:44:05,447 --> 01:44:06,906
No.

1023
01:44:07,908 --> 01:44:11,452
Then maybe I need to
try a little harder.

1024
01:44:18,835 --> 01:44:21,587
Viscous material !
What did I tell you?

1025
01:44:21,672 --> 01:44:23,339
Get it!

1026
01:44:23,715 --> 01:44:24,840
(SCREAMING)

1027
01:44:32,182 --> 01:44:34,350
Hot.

1028
01:44:34,434 --> 01:44:35,434
Come on !
Yes.

1029
01:44:35,519 --> 01:44:39,021
We've got
to get the antidote
to Van Helsing ! Go!

1030
01:44:42,192 --> 01:44:43,985
You can't go until
I say you can go!

1031
01:44:44,069 --> 01:44:45,695
Keep running, Carl !

1032
01:44:46,905 --> 01:44:49,699
And I'll say you can
go when you're dead !

1033
01:45:33,243 --> 01:45:34,744
Oh, my God !

1034
01:46:04,900 --> 01:46:08,361
What are you doing?
You must find the cure!

1035
01:46:08,445 --> 01:46:09,820
My friends are
doing it for me.

1036
01:46:09,905 --> 01:46:11,197
Friends.

1037
01:46:11,281 --> 01:46:12,990
Yes. You want one?

1038
01:46:13,075 --> 01:46:14,367
I can't unscrew the bolts.

1039
01:46:14,451 --> 01:46:15,743
This is gonna hurt.

1040
01:46:15,827 --> 01:46:17,703
I am accustomed to pain.

1041
01:46:17,788 --> 01:46:19,580

know you're alive.

Help me!

01:49:34,359 --> 01:49:36,485
But you're supposed to die.

1051
01:49:37,153 --> 01:49:39,405
I want to live.

1052
01:49:42,826 --> 01:49:44,159
All right!

1053
01:49:49,165 --> 01:49:51,250
Be happy in the knowledge

1054
01:49:51,334 --> 01:49:55,296
that I shall weep
over your dead body.

1055
01:49:59,467 --> 01:50:01,677
Hang on !

1056
01:50:02,512 --> 01:50:04,847
I'll swing you loose!

1057
01:50:38,965 --> 01:50:41,175
You are too late,
my friend.

1058
01:50:42,427 --> 01:50:44,178
My children live.

1059
01:50:44,929 --> 01:50:47,931
Then the only way to
kill them is to kill you.

1060
01:50:48,600 --> 01:50:49,725
Correct.

1061
01:50:52,562 --> 01:50:53,896
So be it.

We are both part of
the same grand game,
Gabriel.

1067
01:51:25,929 --> 01:51:29,807
But we need not find
ourselves on opposite
sides of the board.

MONSTER: Go!
Go and help
Van Helsing !

1069
01:52:25,071 --> 01:52:26,405
Now!

1070
01:52:27,699 --> 01:52:29,074
Thank you.

1071
01:52:56,060 --> 01:53:01,106
Oh, my God ! Anna,
I need a little help!

1072
01:53:04,235 --> 01:53:05,444
Hurry!

1073
01:53:16,414 --> 01:53:18,582
Throw it to me, Carl !

Yes!

01:53:47,445 --> 01:53:50,948
You are being used,
Gabriel, as was I.

1076
01:53:51,366 --> 01:53:54,034
But I escaped. So can you.

1077
01:54:36,870 --> 01:54:38,579
Anna, my love,

1078
01:54:38,663 --> 01:54:42,291
it is your blood that
shall keep me beautiful.

1079
01:54:43,001 --> 01:54:45,085
What do you think of that?

1080
01:54:49,424 --> 01:54:51,967
I think
if you're going to
kill someone, kill them.

1081
01:54:52,051 --> 01:54:54,219
Don't stand there
talking about it.

Did l mention that it
was you who murdered me?

1088
01:56:03,164 --> 01:56:10,045
It must be such a burden.
Such a curse to be the
Left Hand of God.

1089
01:56:12,966 --> 01:56:15,592
All I want is life,
Gabriel.

1090
01:56:16,427 --> 01:56:19,137
The continuation
of my kind.

1091
01:56:19,222 --> 01:56:23,058
And perhaps
the return of my ring.

1092
01:56:27,105 --> 01:56:30,065
Don't be afraid, Gabriel.
Don't be afraid.

1093
01:56:31,442 --> 01:56:36,697
I shall give you
back your life,
