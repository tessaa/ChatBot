1
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:19,977
Rosetta's in intensive care and the rest
of them, they've just disappeared. Gone!

2
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:24,168
Everything's gone to hell.
Get that camera off me!

3
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:47,440
5-80-pro times four, got about
a dozen more in the car.

4
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,984
Check. Head cam set times three -

5
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:53,455
that's one, two... Where
the hell is the other one?

6
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,200
Ah, modelled by the handsome
man in the mirror.

7
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,827
What else?

8
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:04,498
Got my LED, two D - yes.
My work light - yes.

9
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,546
Fuck it, let's get some coffee.

10
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,627
Bollocks.

11
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:55,517
Alright, mate. You're Deacon?
I'm Gray.

12
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:57,894
Hi.
- I'm the tech specialist.

13
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,935
You not worked with one before?

14
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:04,809
Well, basically I'm in
charge of the camera,

15
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,062
the microphones, all that kind of stuff.

16
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,440
What do you make of the luxury cottage?

17
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:14,402
Right now running water
sounds like luxury.

18
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,070
You're not local?
- Fuck, no.

19
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:20,282
Christ, I couldn't live around here.
There's no Wi-Fi, no broadband, no cable.

20
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,159
Basically it's like the middle ages.

21
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,786
You wanna see the room?
- Yeah, that'll be good.

22
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,288
Come on.

23
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:30,464
Me and you are in here, man.

24
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,046
We're sharing?

25
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:35,423
We're sharing?
- Yeah, well, the main man

26
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:37,176
gets the master bedroom.

27
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:40,683
Do you know him? Something Amidon.

28
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,518
Mark?
- Yeah, that's it.

29
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,266
Great.
- I left a load of crap

30
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:48,771
on your bed, but I'll sort all
that out. You want a beer?

31
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:52,198
Tell you what, you sort out the
bed and I'll put the kettle on.

32
00:03:55,736 --> 00:04:00,616
Well, I didn't do a Breathalyzer
test but he seemed sober enough.

33
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,914
For a Scotsman anyway.

34
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,537
Yeah, I know, I am serious.

35
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:11,418
It just makes me uncomfortable,
all this Big Brother shit.

36
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:15,129
I'm a techie, mate. If you
want your audio clean,

37
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,474
your white balance shiny,
then I'm your man, but...

38
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:25,516
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the bonus
is very generous, but...

39
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,684
By the way, is that
gonna be paid in cash?

40
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:31,608
Because it makes the paper
work a bit... Oh, I'd better go.

41
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:36,276
I made you tea.
- Cheers, mate.

42
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:39,697
Women, ey...
- I wouldn't know.

43
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:48,380
Deacon! Deacon, come on, mate.
Let's get you kitted out.

44
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:50,581
This is ridiculous.
- Well maybe,

45
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:52,917
but it's also regulations.
Oh come on, mate.

46
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:54,376
I've been wearing mine two days already

47
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,837
and I can barely even notice
it's there anymore.

48
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:59,386
That's it.
- You probably enjoy it.

49
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:05,346
Right, listen. Rule number one: I
am not wearing this in the toilet,

50
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:07,932
not unless the toilet is weeping
blood or something.

51
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:09,141
Alright, fine. When you have a poo

52
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,519
or a shower you can take it off,
but the rest of the time

53
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,442
they want it on, alright?

54
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,525
I've been promoted to tripod.

55
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:22,321
It's all been since Belem. Apparently they
had massive gaps in the timeline at Belem

56
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,620
and they wanna plug them using these.

57
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:14,712
Morning.
- Yeah.

58
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,299
Crap-

59
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,140
Deacon, where's your head cam?

60
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:29,265
Look mate, it's not you who
gets it in the neck, alright?

61
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:33,526
Please. I'll sort that out. Please.

62
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:39,232
What have you done here?

63
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:42,861
Get a wiggle on, mate.

64
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:46,280
Yep, alright.
- What are you doing?

65
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:50,911
Going to have a fag. You mind if I smoke?
- Yes.

66
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,248
Excuse me...

67
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,582
What?

68
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:05,961
You know it's like, you can't imagine this
place is gonna be the stuff of legend,

69
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:10,137
like the Arthurian legend in years to come.
- Name me a place that is.

70
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,185
Camelot?

71
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,400
Betting shop, fish bar, laundry.

72
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,857
That's life in miniature.

73
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:25,446
Food, cleanliness and a
little bit of naughty.

74
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:30,495
So how long you've worked for
the congregation, Deacon?

75
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:41,642
So I imagine you must have seen
a lot of insane and spooky stuff.

76
00:07:42,357 --> 00:07:44,421
I don't know about you dude,
but I'm looking forward

77
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:48,267
to seeing some really wired shit.

78
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:53,182
Is there anything I should...
- Yeah.

79
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,517
Don't get your hopes up.

80
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:02,440
Dude, have you just bought booze?

81
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:20,233
It's gone, it's back, it's gone,
it's back. It's gone, it's back!

82
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,084
Come here.

83
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,005
Where are we?
- Hang on, where are we...

84
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:29,008
The village, the church...

85
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:33,178
Right, that's the cottage just
there and there's the church.

86
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,890
Look on the map. You know the
sign for a church, don't you?

87
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:39,059
It's a little round thing with a
cross, see if you can find it.

88
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,028
It's in this area here.

89
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,274
You can't just dial it into a computer.

90
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,072
"Nutsley".

91
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:51,076
Yeah well, that's not where
the church is. Look here!

92
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,701
"Bullshurst".

93
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:03,667
"Bullcone". "Bullcone". "Bullcone".

94
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:06,011
Yeah, it says "Bullcone".

95
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,973
Nah.
- Dude, come on!

96
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,350
No, good luck. No really, it's fine.
You go for it. I'll come back.

97
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,977
You're a misery guts!
- I'll come back.

98
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,437
No, alright, I'll get the corners done,

99
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:25,314
then you can do the fun
bit - filling in the middle.

100
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:28,443
Yeah, perfect, okay.
I'll see you around March!

101
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,788
I got a corner!

102
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:51,724
It's a bit late for the bells, isn't it?

103
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:54,677
Yeah.

104
00:10:43,045 --> 00:10:44,309
Dude, the rules are very clear.

105
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,938
We need to wait for the -what's his
name?- the Realtor General, Amidon.

106
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:50,315
Relator, and he should've
been here yesterday.

107
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:55,737
Dude, even so.
- Right, fine. I'm now going up to the site.

108
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:58,073
But you know I'm not very technical
inclined. I just hope

109
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:02,920
all this delicate equipment doesn't...
- Dude, calm down, man!

110
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,375
You've ever known any Buddhists, Deacon?

111
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,835
Sorry?
- Have you ever known any Buddhists?

112
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,503
I had a girlfriend who was a Buddhist;

113
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,803
she did a vow of silence,
it was fucking brilliant!

114
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:23,265
You know, the accelerator is
not an on-off button, Gray.

115
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:27,477
It's something you can press
and depress gently.

116
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:29,400
Yeah, well, I just turn around.

117
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:35,824
There we go. Thanks mate. Tit!

118
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:39,948
Are we there yet?
- No, fucking sat-nav's fucked.

119
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:43,076
It has taken us in a
massive shitty circle.

120
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,124
Yeah, ask this fella here.

121
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:49,342
He looks like an agreeable
local bumpkin type.

122
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,636
Hi, can you tell us where the
church is round here please?

123
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:56,924
Yeah, you know, it's a big pointy
building with a spire on top.

124
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:58,425
Please be quiet.
- God's house!

125
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:01,270
Please be quiet.
- Alright.

126
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,307
His name's father Crellick.

127
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:13,607
Right, okay... Thanks very much for
your time. Sorry to bother you.

128
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:15,692
Have a cracking day, mate!
- Have a good trip.

129
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,695
Good luck with it!

130
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,203
Can you smell that?

131
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:28,505
It's cows.

132
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,458
I hate cows.

133
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,565
Why do people do this?

134
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:50,936
Satanists, supposedly. They
record messages on them.

135
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:54,441
Spells, curses, that sort of thing...
- Curses?

136
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,067
I got it.

137
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,257
Oh dude.

138
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:21,851
That's nature for you, Deacon.
Big stuff eating little stuff.

139
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:47,664
One glance in the bible
will tell you that.

140
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,997
Or take the miracle of Lanciano.

141
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:57,252
In the year 700 a Basilian monk had doubts
over the actual physical presence

142
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:00,097
of Jesus Christ in the holy Eucharist.

143
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:06,219
While he was performing the
ceremony, before his eyes

144
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:10,932
the bread and the wine transformed
into chunks of living flesh.

145
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:14,811
The question is: Do you give cows names?

146
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:18,907
My mate at school, Scott Andrews,

147
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:25,405
he said he gives his cows names,
or did when he was a kid,

148
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:28,625
and then they couldn't kill them.
They got like attached to them

149
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:34,873
and then that cow ended up living
with them for like about 14 years -

150
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:39,925
the life span of a cow. They said
it was a massive pain in the arse.

151
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:49,017
Cheery stuff.
You alright?

152
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,731
I'm alright, yeah. Just
hanging with my home boy.

153
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,738
Afternoon, Barry.

154
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,663
Father Crellick?

155
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:13,542
I think you've been expecting us.

156
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:19,126
Oh yes, of course! I wasn't sure
what time you'd be arriving.

157
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:23,213
The Relator General has been delayed
but I'm Deacon and this is Gray.

158
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:24,714
Alright.

159
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:29,177
I was under the impression that you fellows
would make me feel underdressed.

160
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:34,724
"You all shall be dressed in humility,
for God resists the proud"

161
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:37,853
"and gives grace to the humble."

162
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:44,159
I'll show you where it happened.
- Thank you.

163
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:14,347
The decision of dedication
that you make today

164
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:19,103
is one of the most sacred and
significant you may declare.

165
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,235
I baptize thee

166
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:28,363
in the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy...

167
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:34,118
What's that?

168
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:52,803
Father...

169
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:59,809
That is mental! Have you seen this?
- Yes.

170
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,903
That is nuts!

171
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:03,896
It's great.

172
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:08,485
So how long have you been
here, father Crellick?

173
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:11,154
This has been a project of
mine for a few years now.

174
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:16,001
The diocese finally acquiesced and we
opened just over two months ago.

175
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,121
These are the church records
you asked for.

176
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:21,794
Great, thanks.

177
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:28,004
I don't quite understand. These
cameras, are they necessary?

178
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:31,475
We have to fully investigate every claim.

179
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,052
Claim?

180
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,430
What claim? We all saw it!

181
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:42,687
It was a very impressive video, father
Crellick, else we wouldn't be here.

182
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:48,321
It's not brain surgery.
It's a fundamentally simple kit.

183
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,577
HD cameras.

184
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:54,661
In this case: pro 5-80s.

185
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:59,002
Electric screwdriver -
one for me,

186
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:00,959
one for you.

187
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:13,508
Okay.

188
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:31,948
It's getting late. Fancy a drink?
- Yeah.

189
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:47,376
Evening.
- Evening.

190
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:51,138
Gray, let's get these off, yeah?

191
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,051
You got Wi-Fi here by any chance?

192
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,849
Dude, I can't believe that video.

193
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:02,899
That's nuts. I must have
watched that 50 times today.

194
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,811
What happens if we
actually find something?

195
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,564
If we see something we report
it and then they decide

196
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,567
whether to follow it up.

197
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,818
What, that's it?
- Yeah, that's it.

198
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,904
And then we're onto the next job.

199
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:18,073
We're here to observe and report.

200
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:20,201
We don't make the decisions.

201
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:25,455
They only recognize miracles
in very, very few cases.

202
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:30,211
Look, we get a lot of time wasters.
- But that video

203
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,880
is impressive. I mean,
you said that yourself!

204
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:37,050
No, no, no, it is, definitely!
I didn't think

205
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:40,595
father Crellick had it in him. I thought
we would have seen the strings.

206
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:44,475
You're saying all that was fake?
- Yes.

207
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,935
What, all the stuff?

208
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:51,439
Even that thing at the end?
- What - on the camera?

209
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,942
I don't know. It was a
glitch or something.

210
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:58,827
So that girl in Spain last year, with the

211
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:03,828
stigmata. You can't fake that.
- No, I was there for that one.

212
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,162
And?
- Fake.

213
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:08,248
No it wasn't.
- And not a very good one.

214
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:12,674
Dude, you can't fake stigmata,
there are holes in your hands.

215
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:16,720
So what was it - hidden blood
capsules or something?

216
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:19,222
No, it was much simpler.

217
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:28,187
Every day for ten weeks the girl's mother
cut her hands and feet open.

218
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:35,360
The girl got septicemia. Do you
know what her mother said to me

219
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,278
after she died?

220
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:43,125
Now you can make my girl a saint.

221
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:14,319
I see his nibs has arrived.

222
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:30,127
My dear brother Deacon.
The prodigal son returns.

223
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:36,629
You are still one of us,
aren't you, Deacon?

224
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:40,298
Hello Mark, how's is
the Vatican these days?

225
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,593
You should really come and see
for yourself once in a while.

226
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:46,846
And this must be our technical
specialist. I'm Father Amidon.

227
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,181
Alright, how're you doing?
- Call me Mark.

228
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:49,516
A pleasure.
- Sorry about the delay,

229
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:51,267
I was at a fundraiser in Boston.

230
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:53,770
I'm really intrigued to see the set up.

231
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:58,858
We've got all the cameras set up on site.
- The regulations clearly state

232
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:02,195
that the entire team must be in
place before commencing anything.

233
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:05,370
That would mean...
- Don't blame him, Mark.

234
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:08,870
It was my idea.
- Why am I not surprised about that?

235
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:15,208
Yeah, well... Church records.

236
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:17,427
Thought they might be useful.

237
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:22,798
Right.

238
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:25,051
Gray.

239
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:27,725
Yeah. Night, mate.

240
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:31,726
You'll be wanting to fit my
head cam, no doubt.

241
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,311
Yeah, sure.

242
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:47,241
He can be very persuasive,
our brother Deacon.

243
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,874
He doesn't really like taking orders.

244
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:57,088
All you need to remember,
Gray, is who's in charge.

245
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:00,961
Right.

246
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,100
Chip forks,

247
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:11,389
tartar, ketchup, what not.

248
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,982
Tuck in.

249
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,319
Did you hear that?

250
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,026
Listen!

251
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:33,378
You're imagining things.
- Let's eat, it's getting cold.

252
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:46,675
What the fuck is that?
- Where's the fire extinguisher?

253
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:53,515
Are you alright?

254
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:57,148
Stay back, stay back!

255
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,778
What is it?

256
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,708
What happened?

257
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,794
What are you doing?

258
00:24:20,918 --> 00:24:22,961
Deacon?
- It's a sheep.

259
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:24,879
A what?
- A sheep.

260
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,632
Dear God!

261
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,967
I don't know.
- Is that blood?

262
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:31,095
Oh, these kids.

263
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,145
Oh my God.

264
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:37,689
Just keep breathing. It's okay...

265
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:40,979
An incident.

266
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:46,156
Well, someone killed an animal,
a sheep, outside our cottage.

267
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:50,785
They set fire to it. They, they burnt
it. The poor creature was in agony.

268
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,658
No, I didn't see the people who did it.

269
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:57,629
It was kids, I think.
Kids from the village.

270
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:47,823
Our Father who is in heaven,

271
00:26:48,524 --> 00:26:53,569
who has shown us this glorious
miracle in your house of worship.

272
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:56,573
Please show yourself again!

273
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:59,200
"Our father who art in heaven,"

274
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:01,202
"hallowed by thy name."

275
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:02,829
"Thy kingdom come."

276
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,123
"Thy will be done, on
earth as it is in heaven."

277
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:07,583
"Give us this day our daily bread."

278
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:09,293
"And forgive us our trespasses,"

279
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,504
"as we forgive those who
trespass against us."

280
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:14,178
"And lead us not into temptation,"

281
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:17,602
"but deliver us from evil."

282
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:37,997
You still up?
- Yeah, can't sleep.

283
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:42,536
You gonna wear that thing to bed?

284
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,418
No, I'll stick it on charge in a minute.

285
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,420
You alright, Deacon?

286
00:27:54,882 --> 00:27:56,382
Yeah.

287
00:27:57,718 --> 00:27:59,218
You?

288
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,137
Yeah, I'm alright...

289
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:04,432
What are you reading?
- What's this?

290
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:10,229
It's a journal from Dr. Pritchard
Mandeville. Now he was the last

291
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:13,941
minister of the church before
it closed around 1880.

292
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:18,654
Apparently the Lord came to him in these
dreams and called him here and told him

293
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:22,074
to open an orphanage nearby.

294
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:23,575
Let's have a look.

295
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:34,304
"A curious town,
none too pleasant for it."

296
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:40,953
"The locals are a solemn bunch
and the skies are leaden grey."

297
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:43,388
Well, I know how he feels.

298
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:47,047
You know, I thought I was gonna
get sent home earlier on.

299
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:51,687
Listen, I wouldn't worry about it. Mark
just likes to do things by the book.

300
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:56,442
He's probably not best pleased that one
of the team members isn't even religious.

301
00:28:56,443 --> 00:29:01,449
Hey, I believe in stuff, just
not as much as you two.

302
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:04,705
Yeah, well, he'll come round.

303
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:07,579
Or you will.

304
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:11,045
Father Crellick, nice to meet you at last.

305
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,960
You do look a little tired, Father
Crellick. Are you alright?

306
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:19,382
You know, it wouldn't do any harm
if you went away for a day or two,

307
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:23,135
think about something else.
We will be very thorough,

308
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:24,808
I assure you.

309
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:28,146
We will need full access to the church.

310
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:30,773
Of course.

311
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:33,738
The keys to the kingdom.

312
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:41,492
Father Crellick has left the site.

313
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,574
Now we're going to examine the altar.

314
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:51,668
Church built around 1260. It's a small
parish enclave on top of a hill.

315
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:56,419
And here's the crucifix.

316
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,089
Solid enough, nothing hidden underneath.

317
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:03,059
Yeah, it might not be the same
one. Could be a duplicate.

318
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:09,855
Note: Must cross check crucifix
against video footage.

319
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:12,652
Are you mental? I mean,

320
00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:17,737
Crellick was standing here, right?
And he was holding a baby.

321
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:23,904
How's he gonna move all that lot?
- You mean, how did he move all that lot?

322
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:27,325
I can't believe you two
are so sure it was him.

323
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:28,826
Hang on.

324
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:31,709
Yep, I've got an idea.

325
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:34,248
There you go.

326
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:37,835
Ah, there it is. - What?
- See it? - No.

327
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,588
Wind the tape back.

328
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:42,299
Right, watch it again.

329
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:47,095
Look at the altar table.

330
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:51,390
The water, it's vibrating.

331
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:55,394
Exactly! A speaker under
the altar would do that.

332
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:59,190
And there's definitely some fixture
holding something under there.

333
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:01,534
What, like a subwoofer?
- Yeah.

334
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:07,573
You saw the size of his congregation?
This is his chance for notoriety.

335
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,784
You know,
headline in the local newspaper,

336
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:11,243
maybe a bit in the evening news.

337
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:14,497
People will start flocking back in,
and even if eventually the Vatican

338
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:19,001
doesn't recognize the miracle -
well, by then the coffers are full.

339
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:21,962
Yeah, some of these people think
they are doing the church a favour,

340
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:25,967
when in reality all they are doing is
dragging us back to the dark ages.

341
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:30,096
Right, we're going to set up
a grid to cover the space.

342
00:31:30,097 --> 00:31:33,057
You take the left transcept,
I'll take the right.

343
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:34,475
Hang on, what are we looking for?

344
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:37,728
Well, anything that doesn't fit.
You know, recent repairs,

345
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:40,356
wires in the wall. Just something
that doesn't look right.

346
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:41,982
You are thinking hidden speakers,
like in...

347
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,530
Yes.

348
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:48,244
That's better across there, like that.
- Alright? Sweet.

349
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:58,332
What's that?
- What, this?

350
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:02,086
It's for detecting magnetic fields. It can
pick up any hidden speakers in the walls

351
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:05,181
larger than like a pair of earbuds.

352
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:08,184
Earbuds?
- Yeah, headphones, Mark.

353
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:36,042
Are you two making that noise?

354
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:39,587
Are you scraping off paint?
- Eh?

355
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,715
Not me, dude.

356
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:23,672
I got you, Deacon, I got you!

357
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:32,426
No, Deacon's alright when you get to
know him. I mean, he seems on top of it

358
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:35,930
if you ask me. He's... Yeah,
alright, he likes a drink.

359
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:39,981
But I mean, he's just having a sip of
the communion wine, so it's all kosher.

360
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,188
Look, booze just relaxes him.

361
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:48,785
Well, I mean, priests are an uptight
bunch and he's got a lot on his mind.

362
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:54,793
That Crellick, he's a few
rosaries short of a crucifix.

363
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,367
Hello?

364
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:01,288
Hello?

365
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,675
Fucking dog bollocks.

366
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:16,345
There it is again.

367
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,023
Is that one of you two?

368
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:21,817
What?
- Shhh, listen!

369
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,860
Gray?

370
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:40,253
Here lies the body of
Samuel Shortage, aged 62.

371
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,380
Not a bad innings, I suppose.

372
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:13,945
It seems... to

373
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:16,072
be coming from over there.

374
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:25,067
"Wrapped up in linen. All wrapped
up in linen and cold as clay."

375
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:32,941
"So beat the drum slowly
and play the fife lowly."

376
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:38,845
What the fuck...

377
00:35:57,614 --> 00:35:59,787
That's fucking weird.

378
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:05,292
What the fuck...

379
00:36:07,624 --> 00:36:10,968
Oh fucking hell, fucking hell...

380
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,379
What is that?

381
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:16,590
Gray!

382
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:21,011
That sodding dog!
- Where?

383
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:24,061
I dunno, I think he ran off.

384
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:27,351
Up you come.

385
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:31,447
I honestly thought some five year
old girl must have broken her leg.

386
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:05,681
I don't know what kind. It was a big one.
- What, like a dachshund?

387
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:08,642
It wasn't a dachshund. It was like the
hound of the fucking Baskervillesl

388
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:09,935
Mark!

389
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:12,312
Mark! Don't move, Mark.
Open your eyes!

390
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,856
He's got blood in his ear.
- Right.

391
00:37:13,857 --> 00:37:15,983
Gray, take him outside, sit him down

392
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:19,737
and stay with him. Stay with him!
- All I need is a little air.

393
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:21,706
You look peaky, Mark.

394
00:37:25,452 --> 00:37:26,577
Mark!
- What?

395
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:28,328
Why don't you go and see a doctor?

396
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:31,165
It's just an in-ear thing. I
must have ruptured my

397
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:33,375
ear drum on the flight. It happens...

398
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:37,421
No, I heard it too. It was like this
weird rasping, scratchy noise,

399
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:40,674
a bit like that.
- Okay, okay, it was rats.

400
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:42,509
Hardly unusual in an old building.

401
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:46,230
Can I just go on the
record please and say

402
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:49,808
that Mark should go and see a doctor!

403
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:53,904
Right, I'm going to bed.
I need to write up my report.

404
00:37:58,902 --> 00:38:02,654
Deacon - I mean what is he, a
Christian or a Christian scientist?

405
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:06,366
So Gray, how did you come to be
working for the congregation?

406
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:09,661
I saw it on a tech recruitment website.

407
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:13,086
Sounded cool, money was good.

408
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:18,304
They did ask me if I was a believer.

409
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:20,631
And I said: "yeah".

410
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:22,133
You lied.

411
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:24,384
Well...

412
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,891
You know, I wasn't

413
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,894
brought up religious.

414
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,809
But you know,

415
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:37,816
I believe in... stuff.
I mean today, right,

416
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:40,030
in the church -

417
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:45,660
didn't you feel... something?

418
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:50,078
A presence?
- Well,

419
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:53,543
it is a church.

420
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:59,428
I'll get you a beer.
- Okay.

421
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:05,843
Deacon!

422
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:08,095
Yes?
- What happened in Belém?

423
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:09,688
No.

424
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:13,100
Dude, I'm gonna keep hassling
you if you don't tell me, okay?

425
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:17,356
I'm gonna badger you if you
don't tell me. Cough it!

426
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:28,699
Belém. Bethlehem in English.
- Right.

427
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,742
It's a town in Northern Brazil.

428
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:36,124
Well, there was a shrine there that was
getting a reputation as a new Lourdes.

429
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:40,544
Cardinal Prefect Renaldi himself
led the investigation.

430
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:44,006
When they arrived they were
amazed. There was a queue of sick

431
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:47,306
people outside the shrine
waiting to be healed.

432
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:48,843
And...

433
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,889
did they see anyone get healed?

434
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,390
Better.

435
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,687
They saw God.

436
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,360
Right.

437
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:05,068
Now we started getting really
confused reports from Renaldi...

438
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:07,537
which barely made any sense.

439
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:12,034
And then... Then they disappeared.

440
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:13,661
Renaldi?

441
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:19,374
Yeah, Renaldi. The Vatican, they went
crazy. It's like a high ranking cardinal

442
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,877
and his team had just vanished.

443
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:29,014
Their bodies turned up in the
jungle a few days later.

444
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:34,431
So what happened?
- The autopsy reports revealed

445
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:39,436
"atypical chemical traces".
- So what does that mean?

446
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:45,162
They what - they got poisoned?
- My guess: Dimethyltryptamine, D.M.T..

447
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:50,322
Powerful hallucinogenic, plant-
derived. The shamans there

448
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:54,618
have been using it for millennia. Maybe
the priests had a bad reaction to it

449
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:58,794
and the locals panicked
and dumped the bodies.

450
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:04,957
Or... maybe... they actually saw God.

451
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:14,179
Hold up your beer bottle.
No, no, side on.

452
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:17,391
Let me show you. There,
hold it up like that.

453
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:18,684
That's it, put your hand
on top like that.

454
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:21,061
Alright?
- Perfect. Now are you watching?

455
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:22,562
Here we go.

456
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:26,608
Dude...

457
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:28,151
Yeah...

458
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,289
Don't believe everything you see, Gray.

459
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,657
Good night.

460
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:42,041
What the fuck...

461
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:50,512
Father, give me the
strength to resist evil.

462
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:56,770
Please protect this house and
prevent evil from entering.

463
00:41:57,557 --> 00:42:03,063
I need your strength, and the
strength of your Son, Jesus Christ.

464
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:13,715
Strengthen my faith and
sacrifice this holy place...

465
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:26,131
Please let me be strong...

466
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:08,510
Strengthen my power and
my faith for this ordeal...

467
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:24,601
"More cages. Sick to my core.
The dreams drew me here."

468
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:30,655
"Perhaps always him. I beseech
you reader, leave this place!"

469
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:34,612
"This village, a painted facade."

470
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:39,288
"He lies beneath
ever hungrier for souls."

471
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:45,205
And this bit: "Now I see the
perfect hideous logic"

472
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:47,253
"of the orphanage."

473
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,293
"I may have a new master now."

474
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:53,673
And that's it. That's
the last thing he wrote.

475
00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:01,429
Does any of that mean anything to you?
- No. No, but I'll tell you something:

476
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:04,474
I don't think it's an accident
that Mandeville's journal

477
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:07,727
ended up in the church records.
I think Crellick put it there.

478
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:11,857
I think he wanted us to find it because we
would read it and understand something.

479
00:44:11,858 --> 00:44:16,363
Something that Crellick couldn't
or wouldn't tell us.

480
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:21,166
But what that is I've no idea.

481
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:26,088
Right, come on, Mark. Let's go!

482
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:30,425
Mark?

483
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,006
Mark?

484
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:41,928
Mark?

485
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:47,734
Deacon, look at his ear.

486
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:51,313
Mark.
Mark!

487
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:01,620
Listen, we'll just let him sleep it off.
The walk will do him good.

488
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:06,878
Please leave me.

489
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,837
It's open.

490
00:45:20,176 --> 00:45:22,260
I heard the voices again last night.

491
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:23,933
Father Crellick!

492
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:28,393
Did you sleep here?

493
00:45:33,356 --> 00:45:36,608
Were those voices coming from
over here, Father Crellick?

494
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:39,908
Looks like those kids have
played a wee trick on you.

495
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:42,572
You think I'm a fool, don't you?

496
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:47,911
We want this to be a miracle
just as much as you do, dude.

497
00:45:47,912 --> 00:45:50,631
No, you don't.

498
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:54,710
I'm not like Mandeville.

499
00:45:57,755 --> 00:46:02,300
If there is anything in this
church this will help us find it.

500
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:07,764
I mean, if a poltergeist farted in here
six months ago we will hear it.

501
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:13,765
This is ghost hunting equipment, is it?
- Well, okay. You know how you said

502
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:15,313
that when you heard the sound

503
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:17,524
it seemed to move?
- Yeah.

504
00:46:17,525 --> 00:46:19,025
Well,

505
00:46:19,402 --> 00:46:24,328
these are radio mics and they've
got an analogue receiver.

506
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:30,662
It's got dials, okay? That means you
can tune between frequencies.

507
00:46:30,663 --> 00:46:32,664
And that's good?

508
00:46:32,665 --> 00:46:35,008
It's where stuff hides.

509
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:37,170
Where did you hear the sound?

510
00:46:37,253 --> 00:46:39,462
Huh?
- Where did you hear the sound?

511
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,589
Well, it was there and then
it moved over to there.

512
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:44,843
Okay. We put one mic here, in the pulpit.

513
00:46:44,844 --> 00:46:48,388
We put one mic over here, let's
say in the middle of these books.

514
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:53,143
We put one mic somewhere
here, on the high altar.

515
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:56,563
And then you can tune in-
between the three of them?

516
00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:58,440
We can then tune between all three,

517
00:46:58,441 --> 00:47:02,360
we can hear three dimensionally
what's going on in this space.

518
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:04,904
And we can put some further around here?

519
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:07,741
We've got 12 in total. Pick your spots.

520
00:47:07,742 --> 00:47:09,159
Okay.

521
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:13,005
Mic check. Mic one, check.

522
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:15,332
Can you hear me?
- Yeah.

523
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:17,792
No, I mean you can hear me, but
can you hear it on the receiver?

524
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:19,794
Oh, sorry.
- Tune it round to 100.

525
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:21,968
On the dial, the big dial.

526
00:47:23,883 --> 00:47:25,976
Cool.

527
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:31,639
Yeah, that will be good, that's where
Mark had his fall, wasn't it?

528
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:35,269
It's dirty work down here, mate.

529
00:47:36,145 --> 00:47:41,993
Right, mic two, check.
- Mic two, check!

530
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,701
Mic seven, check.

531
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:50,622
Yeah, hearing it. Mic seven, roger.

532
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:04,590
Dude, listen.

533
00:48:04,632 --> 00:48:06,132
Listen.

534
00:48:12,056 --> 00:48:13,933
Let me get a hold on that.

535
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:17,903
Alright, that's...

536
00:48:18,813 --> 00:48:20,647
No, that's mic two.

537
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:22,445
Is it moving?

538
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:27,697
Dude, what is that?

539
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:31,199
It's moving,
it's moving along this wall.

540
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,874
Now what?
- Now it's going towards the bookcase.

541
00:48:35,955 --> 00:48:37,502
Just there.

542
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:39,383
That's right there, dude.

543
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:45,723
What is that - an animal?

544
00:48:46,549 --> 00:48:48,551
Is that a voice?

545
00:48:53,556 --> 00:48:56,024
No, it's gone.

546
00:48:58,227 --> 00:48:59,979
It's totally gone.

547
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:03,231
You've checked all this for
speakers, haven't you?

548
00:49:03,232 --> 00:49:05,609
Dude, it was along this wall here.

549
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:08,703
It moved along here.

550
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:11,114
And you've checked that for speakers?

551
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:25,011
There is nothing in there, dude?

552
00:49:29,008 --> 00:49:31,385
Hi Mark, you feeling better?

553
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:34,971
I'm fine.

554
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:48,693
It's definitely over here.
- That's between mics three and four.

555
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:50,571
Right.
- Hold on.

556
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:53,449
Heading towards mic three.

557
00:50:00,873 --> 00:50:02,374
Listen.

558
00:50:07,213 --> 00:50:13,263
12:05h, sound of infant crying. Most likely
interference from a nearby baby monitor.

559
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:19,391
Gray, Gray!

560
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:25,939
Dude.

561
00:50:41,247 --> 00:50:42,747
What's going on?

562
00:50:43,624 --> 00:50:48,169
That was Father Crellick, I just saw him
skulking about in the window over there.

563
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:50,964
I knew it was too good to be true.
Something tangible happens

564
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:52,757
and he just so happens to be there.

565
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:55,969
Dude, we've checked for subwoofers
and didn't find any.

566
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:59,098
How's he gonna...?
- Maybe he went basic.

567
00:50:59,348 --> 00:51:01,099
Loop of fishing line, out the loop

568
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:03,851
and then whip it away again.
- That's bullshit, it's too involved.

569
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:06,646
He didn't even seem with it.

570
00:51:06,647 --> 00:51:09,190
Gray, you don't know that.
- I know it doesn't feel nice

571
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:13,412
to be deceived. I'm going to
follow him, see what he's up to.

572
00:51:13,529 --> 00:51:15,827
This might be us finished.

573
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:45,902
Father Crellick?

574
00:51:59,325 --> 00:52:02,827
I've got to say it pains me to say it but
Mark's theory about that baby monitor

575
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:05,622
is probably correct. It's
the best explanation.

576
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:09,751
No, dude. I switched this off.

577
00:52:09,752 --> 00:52:11,252
What?

578
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:15,432
Dude, the machine is switched off!

579
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:23,515
Father? Are you there?

580
00:52:24,183 --> 00:52:25,809
Father Crellick?

581
00:52:43,327 --> 00:52:44,953
Father Crellick?

582
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:50,717
You don't believe in my miracle,
do you? I prayed for you to come.

583
00:52:52,795 --> 00:52:56,720
If this is not a miracle, if this
is not the hand of God...

584
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:06,479
I can hear it! Where's it coming from?

585
00:53:08,477 --> 00:53:10,604
Fuck, dude!
- What?

586
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:13,481
Calm down. I'm not your enemy here.

587
00:53:13,482 --> 00:53:15,905
But if this isn't a miracle...

588
00:53:17,236 --> 00:53:18,569
Get out of here!

589
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:21,243
Father Crellick...
Oh Christ!

590
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:29,298
Deacon! Gray!
- We're coming! What's going on?

591
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:32,505
Mark, Mark! Where are you?

592
00:53:34,545 --> 00:53:36,547
Fuck! Guys!

593
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:41,184
Oh fuck! Oh God! Oh fuck! Oh fuck!

594
00:53:45,097 --> 00:53:47,816
Oh fuck!
- Father Crellick.

595
00:53:49,101 --> 00:53:54,357
"Christ almighty and his holy mercy,
may the Lord Father assist you."

596
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:45,239
The... the police are with Mark
now. I wouldn't worry,

597
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:48,118
he can be quite the salesman
when he wants to be.

598
00:54:49,578 --> 00:54:52,206
I just don't understand it, Deacon.

599
00:54:52,456 --> 00:54:54,424
What don't you understand?

600
00:54:56,043 --> 00:54:57,544
Crellick.

601
00:54:59,505 --> 00:55:03,716
That's a sin, right? According to you lot.
- A mortal sin.

602
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:05,343
A mortal sin.

603
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:11,775
The souls of those who die in a state
of mortal sin descend into hell.

604
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:14,940
Into hell.

605
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:19,908
But... Crellick was a priest.

606
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:24,993
Priests can be sinners too.

607
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:34,172
Come on, I'm buying.

608
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:50,054
Oh, here we go.

609
00:55:57,646 --> 00:55:59,898
Just keep walking, Deacon.

610
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:01,524
Dude...

611
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:10,157
Not so funny now, is it?

612
00:56:10,158 --> 00:56:12,581
Is it?
- He's bleeding!

613
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:17,628
Dude, that was unnecessary.

614
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:21,093
Deacon! They're just kids, mate.

615
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:28,675
Cheers, love.

616
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:33,435
Take it easy.
- Another one, please!

617
00:56:35,893 --> 00:56:38,441
Just don't tell Mark, okay?

618
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:42,523
Holy people struggle too, you
know? Open a newspaper,

619
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:44,734
we all make bad choices,
same as everyone else.

620
00:56:44,735 --> 00:56:48,159
Yeah well, jumping off a church tower
sounds like the wrong choice.

621
00:56:48,864 --> 00:56:51,116
He was under a lot of pressure.

622
00:56:54,328 --> 00:56:55,829
Pressure?

623
00:56:56,747 --> 00:57:02,504
But Deacon. Mark might want to hide
his head in the sand, but you...

624
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:06,631
You know better, I know you do.
What we saw up there...

625
00:57:06,632 --> 00:57:08,716
Two more, please.
- Deacon, what we saw up there

626
00:57:08,717 --> 00:57:12,391
was not normal. It was not
fucking normal, mate.

627
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:14,847
The people that came before
you lot, right...

628
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:17,725
The pagans.
- Yeah alright, the pagans,

629
00:57:17,726 --> 00:57:20,019
druids, the Aztecs or whatever.

630
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:23,856
They believed in stuff that was real.
You know, they had the moon,

631
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:27,944
the sea, the stars, the sun. They
had stuff, they worshipped stuff!

632
00:57:27,945 --> 00:57:31,530
They didn't know any better. They were just
worshipping what was in front of them.

633
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:35,368
No, they worshipped what
was there, physically there.

634
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:38,998
Whereas you are choosing
to believe and worship

635
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,792
the great "what if".

636
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:47,047
And your point is?
- Well, my point is...

637
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:51,509
My point is, that if there
was gonna be a fight

638
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:57,510
between something that was there
and something which wasn't there,

639
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:02,187
then I know which side I'd bet on.

640
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:05,815
What? Are you...

641
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,151
What?
- Hey, can we get some drinks here, please?

642
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:12,576
Don't make a face, Deacon.
- Bar's closed.

643
00:58:13,657 --> 00:58:17,493
Come on, it's just after nine.
- My pub, my rules.

644
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:20,788
Ah, come on, don't be ridiculous!
- You just served this guy.

645
00:58:20,789 --> 00:58:22,962
A man is dead.

646
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:25,627
A good man.

647
00:58:26,378 --> 00:58:30,223
I know his mum, you should
see the state of her.

648
00:58:31,383 --> 00:58:33,551
Yeah, we don't want any trouble, lads.

649
00:58:33,552 --> 00:58:35,636
The only people causing trouble
around here are you.

650
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:37,638
Look... Deacon, hey, dude, dude, dude!

651
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:41,517
No! Dude, dude, dude!
- We were asked here.

652
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:44,396
We came here to help!
- Help?

653
00:58:44,813 --> 00:58:46,360
Dude, let's go!

654
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:52,203
Deacon, come on, dude!
- I've been there before, Gray.

655
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:55,364
Everyone's trying to sweep
the truth under the carpet.

656
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:57,617
I'm not gonna let it happen again.

657
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:01,295
We've got to go back up there.

658
00:59:12,883 --> 00:59:16,637
Where have you been?
- Listen, Mark, mate,

659
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:19,555
we had a thought about where
the sounds were coming from.

660
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:22,058
So we went to investigate...
- Investigation's over.

661
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:25,561
You can go and pack away your stuff.
I've sent in a revised report,

662
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:27,563
all we're doing is waiting
on the movement order.

663
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:30,733
Mark, come on, mate...
- This is not over!

664
00:59:30,734 --> 00:59:34,361
Really? Well, if you can tell me
which one of the awful events

665
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:37,323
we witnessed constitutes a miracle, I will
be sure to inform my undersecretary.

666
00:59:37,324 --> 00:59:39,867
But...
- There is nothing going on at that church

667
00:59:39,868 --> 00:59:43,537
but a depressed priest with misguided
notions and now he's dead.

668
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:45,122
If you still think it's Crellick

669
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:47,750
then why don't we go back up
there? If nothing happens,

670
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:50,879
then we will know for sure!
- A priest is dead!

671
00:59:51,463 --> 00:59:55,763
I am not going to let this turn
into another campfire story.

672
01:00:13,485 --> 01:00:17,655
It's right there! We get in there and
we... I told him there's something there!

673
01:00:17,656 --> 01:00:21,035
Now we've got it in our
grasp and he wants to go.

674
01:00:37,968 --> 01:00:43,496
"Waiting by the quayside..."

675
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:55,820
"...in your home, boy. Let her go."

676
01:01:01,408 --> 01:01:04,331
"Go, boy..."

677
01:01:07,414 --> 01:01:09,336
Shit!

678
01:01:21,261 --> 01:01:24,480
Hello? Hello?

679
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:51,916
Who's there?

680
01:01:54,461 --> 01:01:56,213
Father Crellick?

681
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:25,624
Deacon.

682
01:02:29,246 --> 01:02:31,919
Deacon.

683
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:46,513
Father Crellick?

684
01:02:52,102 --> 01:02:53,945
What's that?

685
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:12,338
Jesus Christ. Sick bastards.

686
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:02,554
Oh shit, shit!

687
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:07,598
Deacon, what are you playing at?

688
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:18,603
What?

689
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:25,369
Who said that?

690
01:04:38,917 --> 01:04:40,634
Oh my God.

691
01:04:42,087 --> 01:04:43,759
My God.

692
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:52,058
Where's it coming from?

693
01:04:55,683 --> 01:04:57,480
What is that?

694
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:53,707
Who's there? Who's there?

695
01:06:12,844 --> 01:06:19,147
<i>Frazzetti. Frazzetti's eyes..
Oh God, his eyes!</i>

696
01:07:29,087 --> 01:07:30,969
As if we didn't have enough on.

697
01:07:30,970 --> 01:07:32,714
We should be on our way
to Liege right now.

698
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:37,219
The situation is not resolved.
- It was according to my report.

699
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:39,638
Reconsecration is a matter
for the local diocese.

700
01:07:39,639 --> 01:07:40,889
Why are you ignoring what happened?

701
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:43,267
What I found?
- What, some old animal bones

702
01:07:43,268 --> 01:07:46,562
and you imagined you heard something.
- Which warrants further investigation!

703
01:07:46,563 --> 01:07:49,147
It wasn't your call to make.
- Yeah, well, somebody had to!

704
01:07:49,148 --> 01:07:52,234
Well, somebody is going to be facing
serious disciplinary procedures

705
01:07:52,235 --> 01:07:53,902
when this is over.
- Right.

706
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:57,072
This is your last mission with
the congregation, Deacon.

707
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:59,325
I'll make bloody sure of that.

708
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:15,299
Father Umberto Calvino,
he was my tutor.

709
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:19,094
He heads up the Vatican archives
now, all very hush hush.

710
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:22,439
You don't have to tell me, dude.
I've read "The Da Vinci Code".

711
01:08:23,850 --> 01:08:25,934
Grazie.
- Father Calvinol

712
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:28,687
Very nice flight,
I enjoyed that.

713
01:08:28,688 --> 01:08:31,565
Calvino's an expert in church
history. All the stuff

714
01:08:31,566 --> 01:08:33,692
that's been swept under the holy carpet.

715
01:08:33,693 --> 01:08:35,193
Right.

716
01:08:35,291 --> 01:08:37,195
They've been trying to
get rid of him for years,

717
01:08:37,196 --> 01:08:42,075
but when this kind of thing comes along,
- He's a useful man to have in your corner.

718
01:08:42,076 --> 01:08:43,748
The best.

719
01:08:43,911 --> 01:08:47,335
Padre Deacon!
- Padre Calvino!

720
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:49,671
Grazie.

721
01:08:52,337 --> 01:08:55,631
So Padre, looking at all the
information, both the event

722
01:08:55,632 --> 01:08:57,549
and the timeline, most of it is audio -

723
01:08:57,550 --> 01:09:00,510
although there is some physical,
if we include the moving cross.

724
01:09:00,511 --> 01:09:03,180
Why are you suddenly including that now?
- Well, in the light of the new

725
01:09:03,181 --> 01:09:05,641
circumstances, the new evidences...
- What new evidences?

726
01:09:05,642 --> 01:09:09,442
You haven't found anything!
- He knew about Frazzetti!

727
01:09:11,272 --> 01:09:17,650
<i>Frazzetti. Frazzetti's eyes..
Oh God, his eyes!</i>

728
01:09:18,821 --> 01:09:22,616
You could have been saying those
things, we never see your face.

729
01:09:22,617 --> 01:09:28,575
Oh really? What, in Crellick's accent?
Why would I want to mention Frazzetti?

730
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:32,418
Guys, who is Frazzetti?

731
01:09:34,045 --> 01:09:39,466
He worked for the congregation. He was
in Belem. He was second in command,

732
01:09:39,467 --> 01:09:41,264
under Deacon.

733
01:09:41,678 --> 01:09:46,014
Wait - Deacon was in Belém?
- Gray...

734
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:47,683
Deacon likes to edit the story

735
01:09:47,684 --> 01:09:49,726
to make him less culpable.

736
01:09:49,727 --> 01:09:54,398
When he got there each and every
one of the priests was still alive.

737
01:09:54,399 --> 01:09:57,152
All he had to do was bring them home,

738
01:09:57,485 --> 01:09:59,986
but he couldn't resist meddling.
The scammers thought

739
01:09:59,987 --> 01:10:04,583
they'd been discovered and murdered
each and every one of them.

740
01:10:04,617 --> 01:10:07,961
Would have murdered Deacon too
if he wasn't drunk that night.

741
01:10:10,164 --> 01:10:14,919
Alright, but "Frazzetti's eyes" -

742
01:10:15,086 --> 01:10:16,883
what does that mean?

743
01:10:18,339 --> 01:10:24,498
During the visions, Frazzetti was unable
to deal with what he was seeing.

744
01:10:27,932 --> 01:10:30,767
He cut his own eyes out.

745
01:10:30,768 --> 01:10:34,771
Look, okay fine, I will see this through,
okay, but then I am done!

746
01:10:34,772 --> 01:10:38,993
I'm going back to corporates.
It's boring but it's a lot less grief!

747
01:10:39,277 --> 01:10:43,155
Because Deacon has been lying to me
and because you've been lying to me.

748
01:10:43,156 --> 01:10:46,580
I mean, do any of you people
tell the fucking truth?

749
01:10:46,701 --> 01:10:48,744
I don't give a monkey's about the bonus!

750
01:10:48,745 --> 01:10:51,788
You can give that to
the fucking poor or something!

751
01:10:51,789 --> 01:10:54,666
You know what? Dan Brown
was right about you lot!

752
01:10:54,667 --> 01:10:58,546
You can stick your hail Marys
up your fucking arse!

753
01:10:58,755 --> 01:11:02,680
Oh, he's gone. Oh well, ciao Signore.

754
01:11:18,441 --> 01:11:21,194
So Father Amidon.

755
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:26,865
Relator General, no less. I always
knew you would rise far.

756
01:11:26,866 --> 01:11:30,619
I don't want you to think that I
resent your presence here but

757
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:33,839
Deacon had no authority
to make that call.

758
01:11:34,457 --> 01:11:37,918
I still don't understand why you
would want to travel all this way.

759
01:11:37,919 --> 01:11:43,550
He may be insubordinate but
he may also be correct.

760
01:11:45,009 --> 01:11:48,553
Do you know of Pope Gregory's
letter to Mellitus?

761
01:11:48,554 --> 01:11:51,890
Mellitus? He was sent by Gregory
on a mission

762
01:11:51,891 --> 01:11:56,441
to bring Christianity to
the pagans of England.

763
01:11:56,521 --> 01:12:02,354
Gregory wrote: "By no means destroy
the temples of the heathen gods"

764
01:12:02,819 --> 01:12:06,863
"but rather the idols that
are within those temples."

765
01:12:06,864 --> 01:12:11,493
"When you have purified them with
holy water, place altars there."

766
01:12:11,494 --> 01:12:14,955
You're saying the church
used to be a pagan temple?

767
01:12:14,956 --> 01:12:18,255
No, no, not the building.

768
01:12:19,085 --> 01:12:21,178
But the ground.

769
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:27,884
This site has always been a site of
significance. What is present at this place

770
01:12:27,885 --> 01:12:30,638
is older than the church,

771
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:35,442
older than Christianity.
- So what is it,

772
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:40,657
like an evil spirit? A demon?
- Two words for the same thing.

773
01:12:41,065 --> 01:12:46,319
Once people worshipped it as a god.
The Church came along and drove it out,

774
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:50,950
they called it the Antichrist.
It does not matter what we call it.

775
01:12:52,618 --> 01:12:55,246
But now it has returned,

776
01:12:55,705 --> 01:13:00,210
like weeds that creep through
an abandoned building.

777
01:13:07,717 --> 01:13:10,010
Do you know what the foundation
of friendship is, Deacon?

778
01:13:10,011 --> 01:13:11,511
Yes.

779
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:15,023
It's trust, mate.
It's trust, alright?

780
01:13:15,975 --> 01:13:18,643
I know that...
- I have to sit there... I have to sit there

781
01:13:18,644 --> 01:13:20,812
listening to your stories, alright,

782
01:13:20,813 --> 01:13:22,731
and we're bonding,
I think we're bonding.

783
01:13:22,732 --> 01:13:24,691
There were reasons I didn't
tell you the truth.

784
01:13:24,692 --> 01:13:27,490
Yeah, well, it turns out
it's all bollocks!

785
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:30,990
We are near.

786
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:49,674
Gray. Gray. It was a mistake.
- No, mate.

787
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:53,053
A mistake is when you spill a drink
or drop your phone in the toilet.

788
01:13:53,054 --> 01:13:56,973
What you did was a lie, mate.
- Let's put this into perspective, okay?

789
01:13:56,974 --> 01:14:01,519
I didn't kill those men. But I was
warned and I ignored it.

790
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:05,565
And seven priests died. I am
going to have to live with that

791
01:14:05,566 --> 01:14:07,568
for the rest of my life.

792
01:14:10,613 --> 01:14:12,114
Let's go.

793
01:14:34,387 --> 01:14:36,013
Can you feel that?

794
01:14:43,562 --> 01:14:45,439
I don't like this.

795
01:15:01,872 --> 01:15:04,290
Padre, I've seen this symbol before.

796
01:15:04,291 --> 01:15:06,918
Yes, in the pagan times many
different gods were

797
01:15:06,919 --> 01:15:09,763
worshipped in different regions.

798
01:15:09,839 --> 01:15:14,384
This symbol represents a deity
of the people who were here.

799
01:15:14,385 --> 01:15:16,182
Which deity?

800
01:15:16,595 --> 01:15:18,813
There is so much we don't know.

801
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:24,278
Even the name of this pagan
god eludes us. But this symbol

802
01:15:24,729 --> 01:15:26,981
is all we need -

803
01:15:27,606 --> 01:15:30,154
for the banishment ceremony.

804
01:15:45,583 --> 01:15:48,962
This is ridiculous. This isn't
even a Christian ceremony.

805
01:15:49,045 --> 01:15:55,050
For the very first time I have seen
things here I can't explain.

806
01:15:55,051 --> 01:15:57,844
"In vino veritas".
- Yeah, sure.

807
01:15:57,845 --> 01:16:02,807
Mark, Mark! What about the baby?
We both heard that

808
01:16:02,808 --> 01:16:06,686
and the radios were off.
- Ferric oxide.

809
01:16:06,687 --> 01:16:08,354
What?
- I read of caves in France

810
01:16:08,355 --> 01:16:11,357
where people heard sounds.
Turns out the walls

811
01:16:11,358 --> 01:16:14,736
of the caves were rich in
ferric oxide. When the walls

812
01:16:14,737 --> 01:16:18,323
resonated at the right frequency,
they gave out sounds

813
01:16:18,324 --> 01:16:21,743
like a primitive tape recorder.
- That's bullshit!

814
01:16:21,744 --> 01:16:24,621
Why is it after all you've seen

815
01:16:24,622 --> 01:16:28,666
you continue to cling to bizarre
and desperate theories?

816
01:16:28,667 --> 01:16:32,295
Desperate theories? It's scientific
reasoning what we do.

817
01:16:32,296 --> 01:16:37,097
Maybe so, but we're also
representatives of the church!

818
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:42,597
Are you questioning my faith?
One question:

819
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:45,892
Do you accept there are things
happening in this church,

820
01:16:45,893 --> 01:16:49,192
things beyond science?
- No!

821
01:16:49,313 --> 01:16:54,109
You know what, I'm a virtuous man.
I follow the teachings of Jesus.

822
01:16:54,110 --> 01:16:57,862
But that's not enough, is it? I'm
supposed to believe in magic now,

823
01:16:57,863 --> 01:17:01,616
supposed to believe the world was created
in six days, believe in empty rituals.

824
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:03,539
Well, I don't!

825
01:17:04,161 --> 01:17:05,495
And it's high time the Church

826
01:17:05,496 --> 01:17:10,092
got rid of these alienating
medieval superstitions.

827
01:17:20,094 --> 01:17:24,144
All that remains is the finishing ritual.

828
01:17:24,348 --> 01:17:30,730
"In nomine Patris et Filii,
et Spiritus Sancti."

829
01:17:31,355 --> 01:17:34,825
"In nomine Patris et Filii..."

830
01:17:46,370 --> 01:17:49,293
<i>Get away!</i>
- Did you hear that?

831
01:17:49,707 --> 01:17:51,584
<i>Get away!</i>

832
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:56,422
Go back! Go back! I command you!

833
01:18:17,193 --> 01:18:20,697
Mark? Mark?

834
01:18:21,572 --> 01:18:25,576
Mark. Mark, can you hear me?
Are you okay?

835
01:18:26,452 --> 01:18:31,753
Gray, can you hear? Are you hurt?
- Where's Father Calvino?

836
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,047
Father Calvino!

837
01:18:38,047 --> 01:18:40,220
Father Calvino!

838
01:18:41,133 --> 01:18:45,604
Father! Father Calvino!

839
01:18:50,517 --> 01:18:54,021
Shit! Shit!

840
01:18:54,271 --> 01:18:56,814
Please, please!

841
01:18:56,815 --> 01:19:00,652
Come on, you fucker!
I'm not in this!

842
01:19:00,653 --> 01:19:03,702
Goddamn it!

843
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:09,660
Deacon?

844
01:19:19,171 --> 01:19:20,671
Deacon!

845
01:19:22,549 --> 01:19:24,049
Deacon!

846
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:43,944
Fuck...

847
01:19:56,458 --> 01:20:00,633
Deacon! -Jesus!
- Deacon! -Jesus!

848
01:20:00,879 --> 01:20:03,840
Shit!
- Oh God!

849
01:20:03,841 --> 01:20:06,384
Okay, Gray, come here. Now look at me!

850
01:20:06,385 --> 01:20:10,596
Now you need to calm down!
- Okay. Dude, have you seen Mark?

851
01:20:10,597 --> 01:20:12,724
Mark?
- Yeah.

852
01:20:12,975 --> 01:20:17,571
I think he wandered down here. He was there
one minute, then he was just fucking gone.

853
01:20:17,771 --> 01:20:20,319
I'm going to take the light away now.
- Okay.

854
01:20:22,985 --> 01:20:25,695
Stay right behind me.
- Let's just get the fuck out of here, man!

855
01:20:25,696 --> 01:20:29,907
Father Calvino!
- You said he came down here?

856
01:20:29,908 --> 01:20:32,410
I don't know. I think so.

857
01:20:33,579 --> 01:20:35,331
What the fuck is that?

858
01:20:37,333 --> 01:20:39,255
Right, right, right.

859
01:20:41,712 --> 01:20:46,012
What if it's not Calvino?
What if it's not Calvino?

860
01:20:46,342 --> 01:20:49,891
Padre! Padre?

861
01:20:52,056 --> 01:20:57,560
What's that?
- It's a signal relay, for the head cams.

862
01:20:57,561 --> 01:20:59,854
I can ping each unit with this.
- Is that good?

863
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:02,435
It might be handy if we ever
want to get out of here.

864
01:21:03,275 --> 01:21:04,867
Let's go.

865
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:08,368
There's more blood on the floor.

866
01:21:12,951 --> 01:21:14,451
What's that?

867
01:21:17,331 --> 01:21:20,004
It's... it's Calvino's.

868
01:21:21,126 --> 01:21:23,048
There's more blood, Gray.

869
01:21:24,963 --> 01:21:29,093
We should go back. We
should get a search party.

870
01:21:29,927 --> 01:21:32,771
No, I can find him myself.

871
01:21:35,265 --> 01:21:38,439
It's wrong down here, Deacon.

872
01:21:40,104 --> 01:21:45,110
It's just echoes. There are
no monsters, no devils.

873
01:21:47,236 --> 01:21:51,206
It's not real Gray, it's not real.

874
01:21:51,657 --> 01:21:53,157
Come on.

875
01:22:00,833 --> 01:22:03,506
Fuck... fuck!

876
01:22:06,422 --> 01:22:07,922
Okay.

877
01:22:15,305 --> 01:22:17,432
Dude, my ears have just popped!

878
01:22:17,433 --> 01:22:22,985
Yeah, I think we're going deep.
Deep into the hill.

879
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:35,250
What on earth...

880
01:22:36,118 --> 01:22:37,870
What is this?

881
01:22:43,459 --> 01:22:49,810
"Please God, save them and forgive
me. I have a new master now."

882
01:22:53,427 --> 01:22:57,306
It's Mandeville.
- What would Mandeville be doing down here?

883
01:22:58,974 --> 01:23:00,433
Gray.

884
01:23:00,434 --> 01:23:02,902
What the fuck is down here, dude?

885
01:23:12,362 --> 01:23:15,156
Have you ever seen anything
like this before?

886
01:23:15,157 --> 01:23:16,657
Mark?

887
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:22,122
Deacon. - Did you hear that?
- Mark?

888
01:23:22,456 --> 01:23:24,003
Mark?

889
01:23:26,168 --> 01:23:27,669
Mark?

890
01:23:29,046 --> 01:23:31,048
It's getting tighter.

891
01:23:35,844 --> 01:23:37,391
Mark?

892
01:23:40,098 --> 01:23:41,598
Dude!

893
01:23:44,353 --> 01:23:47,732
What is this?
- Look at that!

894
01:23:50,692 --> 01:23:55,868
Looks like that was a sacrificial altar.

895
01:23:56,490 --> 01:23:58,412
Those cages...

896
01:23:58,742 --> 01:24:01,711
Fuck, Deacon.
- Dear God.

897
01:24:02,538 --> 01:24:04,415
They killed kids.

898
01:24:05,207 --> 01:24:07,584
Who could...
- Mandeville.

899
01:24:07,918 --> 01:24:11,513
The orphanage.
- Oh fuck.

900
01:24:12,005 --> 01:24:13,757
Dear God.

901
01:24:16,593 --> 01:24:18,766
Fuck, Deacon.

902
01:24:25,811 --> 01:24:27,311
Mark?

903
01:24:29,356 --> 01:24:31,984
Mark, is that you? Mark?

904
01:24:35,112 --> 01:24:37,614
It's okay, I can see him! Mark!

905
01:24:38,448 --> 01:24:41,451
Deacon! Deacon, wait!

906
01:24:42,744 --> 01:24:44,244
Mark!

907
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:50,632
Just wait, I'm coming! It's me!
Mark! No, Mark, wait! Mark!

908
01:24:57,301 --> 01:25:02,227
Mark? Mark? Where are you? Mark?

909
01:25:03,849 --> 01:25:05,521
Deacon!

910
01:25:06,935 --> 01:25:09,395
Deacon!
- Gray!

911
01:25:09,396 --> 01:25:14,447
Hold on, hold on.
- Dude, help me!

912
01:25:15,193 --> 01:25:17,069
Get me the fuck out of here!
- Okay.

913
01:25:17,070 --> 01:25:22,076
Help me, Deacon!
- Alright, just wait a second. Okay, right!

914
01:25:23,452 --> 01:25:26,205
Gray, give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

915
01:25:27,623 --> 01:25:31,334
Just an inch at a time. That's it,

916
01:25:31,335 --> 01:25:37,118
come on. There you go,
come on. Come on!

917
01:25:38,717 --> 01:25:40,514
One more.

918
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:46,140
Right, come on. I saw
Mark, he's just ahead.

919
01:25:46,141 --> 01:25:49,235
Mark!
- Deacon, wait!

920
01:25:53,982 --> 01:25:57,110
Mark.
Mark!

921
01:26:01,698 --> 01:26:04,246
Mark! Mark!

922
01:26:06,244 --> 01:26:07,744
Mark!

923
01:26:14,086 --> 01:26:15,586
Mark!

924
01:26:24,262 --> 01:26:26,981
Mark! Mark!

925
01:26:34,022 --> 01:26:35,774
Father Calvino.

926
01:26:36,733 --> 01:26:40,328
Father Calvino, it's Deacon.
We're just coming to get you!

927
01:26:47,285 --> 01:26:50,129
Careful, careful.

928
01:26:52,207 --> 01:26:54,175
It opens a bit here.

929
01:26:54,584 --> 01:26:56,381
Deacon.

930
01:26:57,671 --> 01:26:59,764
My prodigal pupil,

931
01:27:02,843 --> 01:27:07,179
Deacon.
- It's a bit... a bit tight in here.

932
01:27:07,180 --> 01:27:08,680
You alright?

933
01:27:11,935 --> 01:27:13,769
Gray, are you there?
- I'm here, mate.

934
01:27:13,770 --> 01:27:15,270
Hang on!

935
01:27:18,483 --> 01:27:21,402
You alright?
- What is this place? It stinks in here!

936
01:27:21,403 --> 01:27:24,952
Just keep close, okay?
- Okay.

937
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:30,661
Okay, stop. Stop, Gray!

938
01:27:30,662 --> 01:27:34,917
Stop. It's getting too tight in here.

939
01:27:35,292 --> 01:27:38,136
We'll have to go back.
- I'll turn around, man.

940
01:27:38,837 --> 01:27:41,886
Just back up. Back up.

941
01:27:43,508 --> 01:27:45,801
Just make your way back down!
- It's wet!

942
01:27:45,802 --> 01:27:47,970
Quick as you like.
- It's wet in here!

943
01:27:47,971 --> 01:27:51,140
Deacon, it's blocked this way!
- What?

944
01:27:51,141 --> 01:27:54,977
It's blocked at this end!
Oh God!

945
01:27:54,978 --> 01:27:59,940
Okay, okay, okay...
- It's moving! Deacon, it's moving!

946
01:27:59,941 --> 01:28:02,284
Dude, dig out!

947
01:28:03,111 --> 01:28:05,534
Dig, come on!

948
01:28:06,031 --> 01:28:07,908
Get away from me!

949
01:28:12,704 --> 01:28:17,458
What are we gonna do? Oh God!
- I don't know. I don't know!

950
01:28:17,459 --> 01:28:19,836
Oh God, it burns!

951
01:28:23,882 --> 01:28:27,226
It's burning! Oh God!

952
01:28:28,345 --> 01:28:31,189
You said it wasn't real!

953
01:28:34,476 --> 01:28:36,694
...said it wasn't real!

954
01:28:55,455 --> 01:29:01,335
Our Father, which art in Heaven,
hallowed be thy name...

955
01:29:01,336 --> 01:29:05,215
Oh God! Oh God!
