1
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:55,230
<i>Um... you have no</i>
<i>actual medical training?</i>

2
00:00:55,488 --> 00:01:00,031
No. I have kids.
Learned a lot right there.

3
00:01:00,285 --> 00:01:04,993
I've seen nurses give my son
throat cultures, and what is it?

4
00:01:05,206 --> 00:01:08,326
You stick a giant Q-tip
down their throat and wait.

5
00:01:08,585 --> 00:01:13,128
Urinalysis: You take that dipstick
to see if the white count's high.

6
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:14,834
- Yes, I understand.
- Yeah.

7
00:01:15,258 --> 00:01:16,669
I'm great with people.

8
00:01:16,885 --> 00:01:20,834
You'd have to observe me
to know for sure. Trust me on that.

9
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,807
I'm a fast learner.
Show me in a lab once...

10
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:27,094
...and I've got it down.

11
00:01:28,813 --> 00:01:31,684
I always wanted to go
to medical school.

12
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,854
That was my first interest.
Then I got married...

13
00:01:35,111 --> 00:01:37,685
...and had a kid too young
and blew that.

14
00:01:38,156 --> 00:01:40,445
Out of high school, I got a job...

15
00:01:40,658 --> 00:01:43,363
...with Fleuer Engineers in Irvine.

16
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,656
I fell madly in love with geology.

17
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:49,625
- Geology?
- Yeah.

18
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:51,915
I learned how to read maps.

19
00:01:52,504 --> 00:01:55,041
Yeah. But I lost my job because...

20
00:01:55,256 --> 00:01:58,210
...my boy got chickenpox,
104 temperature.

21
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:01,552
My ex-husband was useless, <i>so...</i>

22
00:02:01,804 --> 00:02:03,596
That didn't really work out.

23
00:02:10,104 --> 00:02:12,560
You got a really nice office.

24
00:02:14,859 --> 00:02:16,104
Thanks.

25
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:22,617
<i>Look...</i>

26
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:55,515
Oh, fuck!

27
00:03:03,658 --> 00:03:06,363
Goddamn it!

28
00:03:45,867 --> 00:03:47,242
Good morning, Mr. Masry.

29
00:03:47,452 --> 00:03:49,361
- Morning, Rosalind.
- How are you?

30
00:03:49,621 --> 00:03:53,072
- I'm fine. And you?
- Very well. Thank you for asking.

31
00:03:55,877 --> 00:03:57,252
Good morning.

32
00:04:00,131 --> 00:04:02,883
How you doing?
Donald.

33
00:04:03,092 --> 00:04:04,752
Did you see it last night?

34
00:04:04,969 --> 00:04:07,092
I taped it.
Don't tell me what happens.

35
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:08,627
It was so good.

36
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:11,013
Your nine o'clock's here already.

37
00:04:20,068 --> 00:04:22,310
- Remind me.
- Erin Brockovich.

38
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:25,607
Car accident.
Not her fault, she says.

39
00:04:26,407 --> 00:04:28,115
She was referred.

40
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,701
- Erin, hi.
- Hi.

41
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,795
Ed Masry. Sorry you had to wait.

42
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:41,756
That's okay.

43
00:04:42,173 --> 00:04:45,008
Here, sit. Sit down.

44
00:04:53,351 --> 00:04:54,810
Thank you.

45
00:04:58,356 --> 00:05:01,310
I never thought standing
could take it out of you.

46
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:03,560
Ever since that shithead hit me...

47
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,978
...it's like my body's
put together wrong.

48
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:07,437
You poor thing.

49
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:11,615
Did anyone ask if you wanted coffee?

50
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,539
- Yeah. I'm fine.
- Good.

51
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:19,199
Listen, whoever did this to you
made one hell of a mistake.

52
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:23,589
And you and me, we're gonna
make him pay for it.

53
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,426
So, uh...

54
00:05:27,677 --> 00:05:29,835
...why don't you
tell me what happened?

55
00:05:30,138 --> 00:05:34,432
I was pulling out real slow,
and out of nowhere...

56
00:05:34,684 --> 00:05:38,848
...his Jaguar comes racing around
the corner like a bat out of hell.

57
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:43,185
They took some bone from my hip
and put it in my neck.

58
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:45,732
I don't have insurance...

59
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:49,646
...so I'm about $17,000
in debt right now.

60
00:05:49,866 --> 00:05:54,492
I couldn't take painkillers. They made
me too groggy to take care of my kids.

61
00:05:54,746 --> 00:05:58,197
Matthew's 8,
and Katie's almost 6.

62
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:00,705
And Beth's just 9 months.

63
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,000
I just wanna be a good mom...

64
00:06:03,213 --> 00:06:06,332
...a nice person, a decent citizen.

65
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:09,212
I just wanna take good care
of my kids.

66
00:06:09,761 --> 00:06:13,212
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

67
00:06:15,266 --> 00:06:18,018
Seventeen thousand in debt?

68
00:06:19,938 --> 00:06:21,100
Your ex-husband helping?

69
00:06:21,689 --> 00:06:22,732
Which one?

70
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:26,099
There's more than one?

71
00:06:27,278 --> 00:06:29,318
Yeah, there's two. Why?

72
00:06:35,411 --> 00:06:38,412
You must have been feeling
desperate that afternoon.

73
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,083
What's your point?

74
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,741
Broke, three kids, no job.

75
00:06:43,086 --> 00:06:46,087
- Doctor in a Jaguar is a meal ticket...
- Objection.

76
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:47,833
- Sustained.
- He hit me!

77
00:06:48,091 --> 00:06:49,118
So you say.

78
00:06:49,222 --> 00:06:52,010
He came tearing around the corner,
out of control.

79
00:06:52,262 --> 00:06:57,256
An ER doctor, who spends his days
saving lives, was out of control?

80
00:06:57,517 --> 00:07:01,135
That asshole smashed in
my fucking neck!

81
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:05,983
Open and fucking shut?!

82
00:07:06,234 --> 00:07:09,318
- Exactly the language...
- It was over before that!

83
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:11,189
I told you he might get personal.

84
00:07:11,406 --> 00:07:13,398
- You said I was set.
- I never said that.

85
00:07:13,658 --> 00:07:16,030
You told me I had a good shot!

86
00:07:16,286 --> 00:07:19,986
- Let's settle down.
- Fuck "settle down"! I've got $74.

87
00:07:20,248 --> 00:07:23,866
- I can't afford to settle down!
- I'm sorry, Erin.

88
00:07:25,461 --> 00:07:30,170
Do they teach lawyers to apologize?
Because you suck at it.

89
00:08:04,042 --> 00:08:05,417
Hello?

90
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,627
- Hi.
- Hi, Erin.

91
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:10,204
You're back so soon.

92
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:13,047
Were you a good girl?

93
00:08:13,301 --> 00:08:16,884
You're my little baby.
What is that? A little cough?

94
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:18,211
She's got a cough.

95
00:08:18,556 --> 00:08:21,972
I sat in the steam with her
to try to loosen it up.

96
00:08:22,227 --> 00:08:25,014
- I think I've got cough medicine.
<i>- Bueno.</i>

97
00:08:26,481 --> 00:08:27,524
Listen.

98
00:08:27,732 --> 00:08:29,641
I didn't wanna tell you before.

99
00:08:30,068 --> 00:08:31,941
- With your worries.
- What?

100
00:08:32,487 --> 00:08:35,737
My daughter bought a big house
with a room for me.

101
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:37,574
I'm moving in with her.

102
00:08:37,825 --> 00:08:39,236
- When?
- Next week.

103
00:08:39,494 --> 00:08:43,029
- Next week?
- I know. But it's good for me.

104
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,911
Now I can help
take care of my grandkids.

105
00:08:46,167 --> 00:08:47,246
It's good for you.

106
00:08:47,502 --> 00:08:50,289
Now with money, you can hire
a good babysitter.

107
00:08:50,547 --> 00:08:52,539
Not the old lady next door.

108
00:08:53,007 --> 00:08:54,418
Thanks.

109
00:08:58,596 --> 00:08:59,841
Matthew?

110
00:09:00,056 --> 00:09:03,176
- Katie, you back here?
- Yeah.

111
00:09:03,434 --> 00:09:04,763
Come on in, would ya?

112
00:09:09,232 --> 00:09:13,395
- Hey, get in the house. No dripping.
- Okay!

113
00:09:16,364 --> 00:09:21,322
Sweetie. Please don't
get sick on me, please.

114
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:31,748
Let's fix dinner.

115
00:09:33,923 --> 00:09:35,501
Yes, look.

116
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:42,591
Look at the water.

117
00:09:50,315 --> 00:09:53,434
Goddamn it!

118
00:09:53,735 --> 00:09:56,142
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

119
00:09:58,114 --> 00:10:02,242
Matthew! Katie! We're going out!

120
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:07,868
You go ahead and order.

121
00:10:08,124 --> 00:10:11,789
I'm gonna have a cheeseburger
deluxe with a Coke.

122
00:10:13,254 --> 00:10:17,881
Mommy, can I have a cheeseburger
deluxe with no cheese and no bread?

123
00:10:19,511 --> 00:10:20,921
Did you get that?

124
00:10:21,638 --> 00:10:26,513
And she will have a cup of chicken
broth and a few crackers, please.

125
00:10:26,768 --> 00:10:29,306
- And for you?
- Just a cup of coffee.

126
00:10:30,146 --> 00:10:31,344
You're not eating?

127
00:10:31,606 --> 00:10:36,184
My lawyer took me out to a fancy lunch
to celebrate, and I'm still stuffed.

128
00:10:36,694 --> 00:10:38,153
How about that?

129
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:21,612
Yes, I'm calling about
the job ad in the paper.

130
00:11:21,865 --> 00:11:24,071
I'm calling about the job ad.

131
00:11:24,325 --> 00:11:26,365
The great personality, good voice.

132
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:29,110
I don't have any actual
sales experience.

133
00:11:29,372 --> 00:11:32,741
I don't really have a resume,
but I can...

134
00:11:33,001 --> 00:11:35,242
I don't have any computer skills.

135
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:40,291
Oh. Well, I thought it was
the local store.

136
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,208
Okay. Thanks anyway.

137
00:11:43,845 --> 00:11:45,220
Okay, bye.

138
00:11:51,352 --> 00:11:52,550
Ed Masry, please.

139
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:54,852
Yes, I'm holding for Ed Masry.

140
00:11:55,106 --> 00:11:56,600
Is he ever in the office?

141
00:11:57,066 --> 00:11:59,273
No, but I've called
about a dozen times.

142
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:01,145
I'd like to leave a message.

143
00:12:01,404 --> 00:12:05,022
Brockovich, B-R-O-C-K-O-V-l-C-H.

144
00:12:05,533 --> 00:12:08,819
I'm a client. I want him to call.
It's that simple.

145
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,411
Okay.

146
00:12:29,307 --> 00:12:31,513
Goddamn it!

147
00:12:31,809 --> 00:12:34,561
- Brenda! Brenda!
- Yeah?

148
00:12:35,146 --> 00:12:36,890
Who put that there?

149
00:12:37,106 --> 00:12:38,850
The files you asked for.

150
00:12:39,108 --> 00:12:42,524
I didn't ask you to put it
in the middle of the floor.

151
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:45,530
Get a towel, will you?
Hey, hey...

152
00:12:47,742 --> 00:12:50,280
- Hey, what's she doing here?
- Who?

153
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:55,916
Donald.

154
00:12:58,086 --> 00:12:59,497
What's she doing here?

155
00:12:59,754 --> 00:13:01,165
She works here.

156
00:13:13,977 --> 00:13:15,019
Erin.

157
00:13:15,603 --> 00:13:17,181
How's it going?

158
00:13:17,647 --> 00:13:20,019
You never called me back.
I left messages.

159
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,899
You did? I didn't know that.
Donald seems to think...

160
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:29,523
There's two things that aggravate me:
Being ignored and being lied to.

161
00:13:29,784 --> 00:13:32,026
- I never lied.
- You said things'd be fine.

162
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,030
They're not. I trusted you.

163
00:13:34,289 --> 00:13:35,866
- I'm sorry.
- I don't need pity.

164
00:13:36,124 --> 00:13:38,876
I need a paycheck.
And I've looked.

165
00:13:39,127 --> 00:13:43,456
When you spend 6 years raising babies,
it's hard to get a job that pays.

166
00:13:43,673 --> 00:13:47,837
Are you getting this down, honey?
Or am I talking too fast for you?

167
00:13:48,344 --> 00:13:49,720
I'm sorry about that.

168
00:13:49,971 --> 00:13:51,928
But we have a full staff now...

169
00:13:52,182 --> 00:13:57,223
Bullshit. If you had a full staff,
you'd return a client's damn call.

170
00:13:57,478 --> 00:14:02,105
I'm smart and hard-working.
I'm not leaving here without a job.

171
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:17,030
Don't make me beg.

172
00:14:17,707 --> 00:14:20,791
If it doesn't work out, fire me.

173
00:14:22,253 --> 00:14:23,451
Don't make me beg.

174
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:31,842
No benefits.

175
00:14:34,432 --> 00:14:38,097
What we do in here is file
all of the cases.

176
00:14:38,353 --> 00:14:41,887
That way, at any time,
we can tell the status of a file.

177
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:44,604
Where it is in the office and stuff.

178
00:14:44,859 --> 00:14:48,311
Here's where we organize
all the files alphabetically.

179
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:50,403
- Simple enough.
- Okay.

180
00:14:50,615 --> 00:14:52,524
- And here is your desk.
- Okay.

181
00:14:52,784 --> 00:14:55,405
I want to show you where
the Xerox machine is.

182
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,826
Everybody has a code.

183
00:14:58,081 --> 00:15:00,572
- Do I get to pick my own code?
- We'll see.

184
00:15:06,965 --> 00:15:11,377
Can you tell me who I talk to about
getting an advance on my paycheck?

185
00:15:11,636 --> 00:15:13,545
Just for the weekend.

186
00:15:14,055 --> 00:15:16,095
Rosalind's the office manager.

187
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:19,303
She handles the payroll
and petty cash.

188
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,717
She's gone already.

189
00:15:20,979 --> 00:15:23,980
She leaves early on Fridays.

190
00:15:27,485 --> 00:15:30,356
- Okay, thank you.
- Oh, for Pete's sake, here.

191
00:15:33,157 --> 00:15:35,945
I've only got hundreds.

192
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,414
I don't want your money, Mr. Masry.

193
00:15:44,085 --> 00:15:47,335
Where do you think
your paycheck comes from?

194
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,045
- Have a good weekend.
- Thank you.

195
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,755
- See you.
- All right, see you.

196
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,714
See you Monday.

197
00:16:07,609 --> 00:16:10,775
Hi, my sweetie. Hello.

198
00:16:11,029 --> 00:16:12,071
How are you?

199
00:16:12,322 --> 00:16:13,780
Matthew, Katie.

200
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,114
- Hey, Mom.
- Hi, sweetie.

201
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,070
How are you?

202
00:16:19,329 --> 00:16:21,736
- Thanks a lot.
- You're welcome.

203
00:16:55,949 --> 00:16:57,194
Hey!

204
00:16:59,327 --> 00:17:00,952
Hey!

205
00:17:06,042 --> 00:17:07,370
Hello.

206
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,370
What are you doing
making all that goddamn noise?

207
00:17:11,756 --> 00:17:15,172
Introducing ourselves
to the neighbourhood, I guess.

208
00:17:15,593 --> 00:17:18,464
Well, I am the neighbours. There.

209
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,719
We're introduced.
So shut up.

210
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:27,014
Wait. Hold on there.
Let's start over, okay?

211
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,938
My name's George.
What's yours?

212
00:17:29,566 --> 00:17:33,694
Just think of me as the person
next door who likes it quiet.

213
00:17:34,195 --> 00:17:35,358
Don't be like that.

214
00:17:35,613 --> 00:17:38,069
Look, we live next door.
I feel bad.

215
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:41,076
I'm sorry.
Will you accept my apology?

216
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:44,946
We're living right next door.
If you need a cup of a sugar...

217
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:47,453
- I don't need sugar.
- You don't.

218
00:17:47,709 --> 00:17:50,579
Why don't I take you
out to dinner to apologize?

219
00:17:51,045 --> 00:17:53,334
Give me your number.
I got your address...

220
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,629
...so you can't get away.

221
00:17:55,884 --> 00:17:58,209
I'll call you up proper
and ask you out.

222
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:01,044
You want my number?

223
00:18:01,306 --> 00:18:03,429
I do. I do want your number.

224
00:18:04,976 --> 00:18:07,811
Which number do you want, George?

225
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:10,930
I like the way you say that.

226
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:12,768
How many numbers you got?

227
00:18:13,151 --> 00:18:16,484
I got numbers coming out
of my ears. For instance, 10.

228
00:18:16,738 --> 00:18:18,232
- Ten.
- Yeah.

229
00:18:18,489 --> 00:18:21,241
That's how many months old
my baby girl is.

230
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:23,570
- You got a little girl?
- Yeah.

231
00:18:23,828 --> 00:18:26,284
Sexy, huh? How about this? Six.

232
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:29,576
That's my other daughter.
Eight is my son.

233
00:18:29,834 --> 00:18:32,586
Two is the times
I've been married and divorced.

234
00:18:32,837 --> 00:18:34,996
$16 is what I have
in my bank account.

235
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:38,251
850-3943, that's my phone number.

236
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:43,053
I'm guessing zero is the number
of times you're gonna call it.

237
00:18:43,848 --> 00:18:46,683
Hey, how do you remember
your bank balance?

238
00:18:46,935 --> 00:18:48,761
See, that impresses me.

239
00:18:49,354 --> 00:18:51,477
You're dead wrong about that zero.

240
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,528
How long has she been crying?

241
00:19:04,285 --> 00:19:06,527
She's got that tooth coming in.

242
00:19:06,788 --> 00:19:11,035
Give her a cold washcloth to suck on.
I'll check back later.

243
00:19:11,292 --> 00:19:12,335
Where's Anna?

244
00:19:12,961 --> 00:19:15,037
She's out to lunch with the girls.

245
00:19:17,841 --> 00:19:20,047
I have to open a file.

246
00:19:21,177 --> 00:19:23,502
Real-estate thing, pro bono.

247
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:25,720
- Okay.
- Know how to do that?

248
00:19:25,974 --> 00:19:28,429
Yeah, I got it. No problem.

249
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:33,017
You're a girl.

250
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:36,317
Excuse me?

251
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:39,943
Why aren't you out to lunch
with the girls? You're a girl.

252
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:44,023
I guess I'm not the right kind.

253
00:19:50,957 --> 00:19:54,456
Look, you may want to...
Now that you're working here...

254
00:19:54,711 --> 00:19:58,625
You may want to rethink
your wardrobe a little.

255
00:20:00,216 --> 00:20:01,259
Why is that?

256
00:20:01,718 --> 00:20:06,759
Well, I think some of the girls
are a little uncomfortable...

257
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:09,381
...because of what you wear.

258
00:20:11,352 --> 00:20:13,012
Is that so?

259
00:20:13,396 --> 00:20:17,441
Well, it just so happens,
I think I look nice.

260
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:20,984
As long as I have one ass
instead of two, I'll wear what I like...

261
00:20:21,237 --> 00:20:22,945
...if that's all right with you?

262
00:20:31,122 --> 00:20:33,874
You might wanna rethink those ties.

263
00:20:48,932 --> 00:20:53,510
With real-estate stuff, could you
remind me? I'm a little confused.

264
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:58,313
Why are there medical records
and blood samples in real-estate files?

265
00:20:58,566 --> 00:21:00,144
You've been here long enough.

266
00:21:00,401 --> 00:21:04,814
If you don't know how to do your job
by now, I'm not gonna do it for you.

267
00:21:21,464 --> 00:21:22,875
Hello?

268
00:21:26,511 --> 00:21:28,385
Hello?

269
00:21:28,596 --> 00:21:32,464
Matthew? Katie?

270
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,995
Matthew? Katie?

271
00:21:58,418 --> 00:21:59,793
Matthew!

272
00:22:20,064 --> 00:22:21,262
What happened?

273
00:22:21,524 --> 00:22:24,015
- Hi, Mom.
- Hey. Hungry?

274
00:22:24,277 --> 00:22:25,356
Am l...?

275
00:22:26,112 --> 00:22:28,568
They're here?
I went to pick them up.

276
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:32,573
She came by an hour ago. Something
came up, she dropped them off.

277
00:22:32,994 --> 00:22:34,192
Something came up?

278
00:22:34,454 --> 00:22:35,497
Why didn't she call?

279
00:22:35,747 --> 00:22:39,875
I don't know. She, I was, she...
I don't know why.

280
00:22:40,293 --> 00:22:42,866
- That stupid bitch.
- Mom!

281
00:22:43,338 --> 00:22:46,872
I just can't believe she dumps
my kids off when nobody's home.

282
00:22:47,217 --> 00:22:48,794
I was home.

283
00:22:49,385 --> 00:22:52,137
We're fine. We cooked
burgers, had some milk.

284
00:22:52,597 --> 00:22:54,839
You want a hot dog? There's one.

285
00:22:55,058 --> 00:22:58,509
- Or a cheeseburger?
- But this mustard is slippery.

286
00:23:00,355 --> 00:23:03,309
Mom, what do you think
about me getting a tattoo?

287
00:23:03,608 --> 00:23:05,482
One, two, three.

288
00:23:10,156 --> 00:23:12,991
I got all these kings.
You win, you got a joker.

289
00:23:13,785 --> 00:23:14,947
King.

290
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:16,620
Joker.

291
00:23:17,205 --> 00:23:19,874
You stole a joker!

292
00:23:20,124 --> 00:23:21,167
You cheat.

293
00:23:21,376 --> 00:23:22,786
What do you mean?

294
00:23:23,711 --> 00:23:27,661
You cheat!
Get another one.

295
00:23:27,924 --> 00:23:29,667
Time to go to bed.

296
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:33,083
Get ready for bed.
Brush your teeth.

297
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:36,553
- Play tomorrow?
- Yeah.

298
00:23:40,478 --> 00:23:41,972
Good night, buddy.

299
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,643
What's that?

300
00:23:43,898 --> 00:23:47,065
This is a Harley-Davidson,
the best motorcycle ever.

301
00:23:47,318 --> 00:23:51,186
And if I ever catch either one of you
near one, knock you silly.

302
00:23:56,452 --> 00:23:59,122
Brush. And keep it down,
the baby's asleep.

303
00:24:00,415 --> 00:24:01,790
You got great kids.

304
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:05,792
Well, I'm sure
I'll fuck 'em up eventually.

305
00:24:07,255 --> 00:24:08,453
Why?

306
00:24:09,465 --> 00:24:13,249
I'm not a good judge of character,
or I wouldn't have left them...

307
00:24:13,469 --> 00:24:17,337
...with that idiot, who cost a lot
and smelled like chicken fat.

308
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:19,924
And after I find her and kill her...

309
00:24:20,518 --> 00:24:22,641
...I don't know what I'm gonna do.

310
00:24:23,021 --> 00:24:25,346
If you need help with them,
I could do that.

311
00:24:26,691 --> 00:24:29,526
- I'm not leaving my kids with you.
- Why?

312
00:24:30,153 --> 00:24:33,486
- I don't even know you.
- What do you wanna know?

313
00:24:34,324 --> 00:24:36,612
- Thanks for today...
- You're welcome.

314
00:24:36,868 --> 00:24:38,492
It was my pleasure.

315
00:24:40,246 --> 00:24:41,740
How many decks did you have?

316
00:24:42,123 --> 00:24:44,330
We had more than enough.

317
00:24:44,584 --> 00:24:46,909
Got so many friends
you can't use one more?

318
00:24:48,546 --> 00:24:53,042
If you need someone to look after your
kids after school, or whatever...

319
00:24:53,301 --> 00:24:55,210
...I don't have a job now.

320
00:24:56,471 --> 00:25:00,171
Oh, that's a great recommendation:
"I'm unemployed."

321
00:25:00,433 --> 00:25:01,476
By choice.

322
00:25:01,726 --> 00:25:03,469
I work when I need to.

323
00:25:04,229 --> 00:25:07,183
What do you do?
Live off your trust fund?

324
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,901
I do construction, which pays good,
and I make it last by living cheap.

325
00:25:12,153 --> 00:25:13,813
Is that supposed to impress me?

326
00:25:14,072 --> 00:25:15,649
Hey. Bed.

327
00:25:15,907 --> 00:25:17,900
Your little ghosts.

328
00:25:19,702 --> 00:25:22,703
You always this hard on people
who try to help you?

329
00:25:23,414 --> 00:25:24,612
I'm out of practice.

330
00:25:24,874 --> 00:25:27,579
Well, let me remind you then.

331
00:25:27,836 --> 00:25:31,667
The polite thing is to say thank you.
I'd start it off with that.

332
00:25:31,881 --> 00:25:34,835
Then, " Hey, that's
a really nice offer.

333
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:37,501
I don't mind taking you up on that."

334
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,843
Why do you want to watch my kids?

335
00:25:40,098 --> 00:25:41,260
- I like kids.
- Right.

336
00:25:41,516 --> 00:25:44,268
I like hanging out with them.
They keep it simple.

337
00:25:47,272 --> 00:25:48,600
You're home every afternoon?

338
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,897
I'm usually working on my bike.

339
00:25:54,571 --> 00:25:59,565
If it doesn't work out, you can always
send them back to the chicken-fat lady.

340
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,784
This isn't gonna get you laid.

341
00:26:10,003 --> 00:26:11,283
Get in bed.

342
00:26:11,546 --> 00:26:14,630
Good, because I don't
find you attractive either.

343
00:26:15,258 --> 00:26:16,301
Then we're even.

344
00:26:16,509 --> 00:26:19,261
I'm so glad we got that
out of the way.

345
00:26:19,512 --> 00:26:20,627
I feel much better.

346
00:26:20,889 --> 00:26:24,222
I do too. Because now I can
just look after the kids...

347
00:26:24,434 --> 00:26:27,435
...and I don't have to worry
about you coming on to me.

348
00:27:25,954 --> 00:27:29,702
Bring the phone into the changing room.
Of course they won't.

349
00:27:29,958 --> 00:27:34,501
Mrs. Masry, don't be such a tease.
Hold on, just hold on. Yeah?

350
00:27:34,754 --> 00:27:37,459
Sorry, would you mind
if I investigate this?

351
00:27:37,882 --> 00:27:38,961
Investigate what?

352
00:27:39,175 --> 00:27:42,342
This real-estate thing
with the Jensens. The pro bono.

353
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:47,004
I wanna make sure I understand
what I'm reading.

354
00:27:47,267 --> 00:27:50,552
- Yeah, yeah, sure.
- You don't mind?

355
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:53,261
Okay, great. Thanks.

356
00:29:03,301 --> 00:29:04,344
Donna Jensen?

357
00:29:05,386 --> 00:29:08,387
I'm Erin Brockovich,
with Masry and Vititoe.

358
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,047
Oh! You're a lawyer?

359
00:29:11,309 --> 00:29:14,643
Hell, no. I hate lawyers.
I just work for 'em.

360
00:29:15,355 --> 00:29:16,397
Do you have a minute?

361
00:29:16,981 --> 00:29:21,275
I don't mean to be a pain to PG and E
after all they've done for Hinkley...

362
00:29:22,487 --> 00:29:27,564
...but if they want this place,
they're gonna have to pay for it.

363
00:29:28,201 --> 00:29:31,736
You didn't put the house up for sale.
They just wanted to buy it?

364
00:29:31,996 --> 00:29:33,823
Oh, yeah, yeah.

365
00:29:34,082 --> 00:29:37,248
Oh, I don't wanna move.
Uproot the kids?

366
00:29:37,502 --> 00:29:39,578
I've got a couple of girls.

367
00:29:39,838 --> 00:29:43,004
Honest to God, I don't know
if I have the energy.

368
00:29:43,258 --> 00:29:47,255
You know, I've been sick.
Me and Pete both have.

369
00:29:48,596 --> 00:29:52,048
The idea of selling, if they're
not gonna pay us properly...

370
00:29:52,267 --> 00:29:53,761
...I don't see the point.

371
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:57,555
Yeah, yeah, I can see that.

372
00:29:58,565 --> 00:30:00,723
I guess the only thing
that confused me...

373
00:30:00,984 --> 00:30:05,195
Not that your medical problems
aren't important.

374
00:30:05,446 --> 00:30:08,862
How come those files are in
with all the real-estate stuff?

375
00:30:09,909 --> 00:30:13,954
There's just so much correspondence,
I just keep it all in one place.

376
00:30:18,626 --> 00:30:23,703
I'm sorry, I just don't see why you're
corresponding with PG and E...

377
00:30:23,923 --> 00:30:26,794
...about your medical problems
in the first place.

378
00:30:27,051 --> 00:30:29,969
Well, they paid
for the doctor's visit.

379
00:30:30,805 --> 00:30:31,848
They did?

380
00:30:31,973 --> 00:30:35,424
You bet. Paid for a checkup
for the whole family.

381
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:40,768
Not like with insurance, where you pay
and maybe you see some money in a year.

382
00:30:41,024 --> 00:30:43,645
They just took care of it.
Just like that.

383
00:30:43,943 --> 00:30:45,224
We never saw a bill.

384
00:30:45,486 --> 00:30:47,313
Wow. Why'd they do that?

385
00:30:47,906 --> 00:30:49,151
The chromium.

386
00:30:49,532 --> 00:30:51,441
- The what?
- The chromium.

387
00:30:51,743 --> 00:30:54,909
Well, that's what
kicked this whole thing off.

388
00:31:35,537 --> 00:31:37,862
- What kind of chromium?
- There's more than one?

389
00:31:38,122 --> 00:31:41,871
There's straight-up chromium,
it does good things for the body.

390
00:31:42,126 --> 00:31:44,664
There's chrom three,
which is fairly benign.

391
00:31:44,921 --> 00:31:47,246
There's chrom six,
hexavalent chromium...

392
00:31:47,507 --> 00:31:50,508
...which, depending on the amounts,
can be harmful.

393
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,465
Harmful how? What would you get?

394
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:57,051
With repeated exposure
to toxic levels, anything...

395
00:31:57,308 --> 00:32:01,769
...from chronic headaches to respiratory
disease, liver failure...

396
00:32:02,021 --> 00:32:05,805
...heart failure, reproductive failure,
bone or organ deterioration.

397
00:32:06,067 --> 00:32:08,309
Plus, of course, any type of cancer.

398
00:32:08,528 --> 00:32:11,445
So that stuff, it kills people.

399
00:32:11,656 --> 00:32:13,031
Yeah, definitely.

400
00:32:13,283 --> 00:32:15,109
Highly toxic. Highly carcinogenic.

401
00:32:15,368 --> 00:32:19,580
It gets into your DNA, so you pass
the trouble to your kids. Very bad.

402
00:32:19,789 --> 00:32:21,663
Well, what's it used for?

403
00:32:21,875 --> 00:32:23,120
A rust inhibitor.

404
00:32:23,376 --> 00:32:28,501
The utility plants use piston engines
that get hot, they run water through.

405
00:32:28,715 --> 00:32:30,672
Chromium's in the water
to prevent corrosion.

406
00:32:31,509 --> 00:32:35,044
How do I find out what kind
of chromium they use in Hinkley?

407
00:32:35,305 --> 00:32:37,630
- Been to their water board?
- What's that?

408
00:32:37,891 --> 00:32:38,970
Every county has one.

409
00:32:39,184 --> 00:32:41,888
They keep records of anything
in their jurisdiction.

410
00:32:42,145 --> 00:32:45,229
- You should find something there.
- County water board.

411
00:32:45,481 --> 00:32:48,601
- Alrighty. Well, thanks.
- Good luck.

412
00:32:49,819 --> 00:32:52,357
I wouldn't advertise
what you're looking for.

413
00:32:52,614 --> 00:32:56,907
Incriminating records have a way of
disappearing when people smell trouble.

414
00:32:57,744 --> 00:33:00,449
I'll remember that. Thanks.

415
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:13,424
<i>This guy's too smart.</i>

416
00:33:13,676 --> 00:33:17,128
<i>It's only a matter of time</i>
<i>until he makes his move.</i>

417
00:33:17,347 --> 00:33:20,051
<i>He positions women employees</i>
<i>in such a way...</i>

418
00:33:20,266 --> 00:33:24,809
<i>... that they have no choice</i>
<i>but to respond or lose their jobs...</i>

419
00:33:31,194 --> 00:33:33,601
- That's a heavy door.
- Let me give you a hand.

420
00:33:33,821 --> 00:33:37,771
Thank you very much. Aren't you
a gentleman, Mr?

421
00:33:37,992 --> 00:33:40,530
- Scott.
- Mr. Scott.

422
00:33:40,787 --> 00:33:44,238
Pleased to meet you.
I'm Erin.

423
00:33:44,457 --> 00:33:46,201
Erin. Erin. Cool.

424
00:33:46,626 --> 00:33:49,117
What can I do for you, Erin?

425
00:33:49,712 --> 00:33:53,662
Believe it or not, I'm on the prowl
for some water records.

426
00:33:53,925 --> 00:33:55,549
You come to the right place.

427
00:33:56,094 --> 00:33:57,469
I guess I did.

428
00:33:58,054 --> 00:34:02,383
Just tell me what you wanna look at,
and I'd be glad to dig 'em out.

429
00:34:02,642 --> 00:34:06,592
I wish I knew. It's for my boss.
He's in this water dispute...

430
00:34:06,855 --> 00:34:11,849
...and he wants me to find all kinds
of papers, from all kinds of places.

431
00:34:15,697 --> 00:34:19,315
You know,
it would probably be easiest...

432
00:34:19,576 --> 00:34:22,530
...if I squeezed back there
and poked around myself.

433
00:34:22,787 --> 00:34:25,990
- Would that be all right with you?
- Come on back.

434
00:34:26,249 --> 00:34:29,784
- I'm gonna need you to sign in here.
- Oh, sure.

435
00:34:35,091 --> 00:34:38,460
- "Pattee," is that your middle name?
- No, maiden.

436
00:34:38,678 --> 00:34:40,053
Oh, you're married?

437
00:34:41,347 --> 00:34:42,842
Not anymore.

438
00:34:45,643 --> 00:34:47,185
- Can I just?
- Yeah.

439
00:34:48,062 --> 00:34:49,225
I love your pants.

440
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,849
Oh, well, yeah, thanks.

441
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,766
Well, this is it.

442
00:34:56,571 --> 00:34:57,734
It's impressive.

443
00:35:00,033 --> 00:35:02,072
I'll call you if I need anything.

444
00:35:04,954 --> 00:35:06,413
- All right.
- Okay.

445
00:35:06,664 --> 00:35:08,040
- Thank you.
- Okay.

446
00:36:32,125 --> 00:36:33,168
Where's my stuff?

447
00:36:33,668 --> 00:36:35,246
Where have you been?

448
00:36:35,503 --> 00:36:37,045
Where the fuck is my stuff?

449
00:36:37,297 --> 00:36:40,214
Don't you use language
like that with...

450
00:36:41,968 --> 00:36:43,011
Someone took my stuff.

451
00:36:43,261 --> 00:36:45,930
- Nice to see you.
- I had photos of my kids...

452
00:36:46,181 --> 00:36:49,680
Toothbrush, toothpaste,
mousse and deodorant.

453
00:36:51,227 --> 00:36:52,270
What's going on?

454
00:36:52,812 --> 00:36:56,430
This isn't a job where you
can disappear for days at a time.

455
00:36:56,649 --> 00:36:59,223
You don't do the work,
you don't get to stay.

456
00:36:59,444 --> 00:37:02,279
All I've been doing is working.
Ask Mr. Masry.

457
00:37:02,739 --> 00:37:05,526
You ask Mr. Masry. He fired you.

458
00:37:08,995 --> 00:37:10,323
You said to fire me?

459
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:13,201
I'll call you back.
You've been gone for a week.

460
00:37:13,458 --> 00:37:17,158
I left a message. I was gonna
write a whole damn report.

461
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:20,919
That's not how we work. You don't
leave a message and take off.

462
00:37:21,174 --> 00:37:24,507
- Want me to check in every second?
- It's called accountability.

463
00:37:24,761 --> 00:37:26,967
I'm not talking to you, bitch!

464
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,223
That's enough!

465
00:37:28,431 --> 00:37:32,844
Look, Erin, this incident aside,
I don't think this is the right...

466
00:37:33,061 --> 00:37:34,472
...place for you.

467
00:37:34,687 --> 00:37:38,436
So I'm gonna make a few calls,
find you something else.

468
00:37:38,691 --> 00:37:39,729
Don't bother.

469
00:37:39,833 --> 00:37:41,062
I'm trying to help.

470
00:37:41,319 --> 00:37:44,818
You're trying not to feel guilty
about firing someone with 3 kids.

471
00:37:45,114 --> 00:37:47,403
Fuck if I'm gonna help you do that.

472
00:37:49,994 --> 00:37:51,786
Get back to work!

473
00:38:12,225 --> 00:38:14,099
What the hell are you doing here?

474
00:38:15,019 --> 00:38:16,478
I'm fixing the leak.

475
00:38:16,729 --> 00:38:19,933
Damn it, I don't ask you
to do things like that.

476
00:38:21,067 --> 00:38:23,309
Look at this mess that you've made.

477
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:26,606
- I'm not done with that yet.
- Well, get it out.

478
00:38:27,866 --> 00:38:29,988
- Relax.
- Shit! Where did it go?

479
00:38:30,869 --> 00:38:31,911
Where is it?

480
00:38:32,078 --> 00:38:33,121
Back there.

481
00:38:33,329 --> 00:38:34,409
Behind your foot.

482
00:38:34,622 --> 00:38:36,745
- Going up your leg now.
- Jesus!

483
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,491
Who fucking lives like this, George?

484
00:38:39,752 --> 00:38:44,877
Who lets their kids run around in a
place with bugs the size of house cats?

485
00:38:45,133 --> 00:38:48,217
All you have to do
is call an exterminator.

486
00:38:48,469 --> 00:38:50,961
I can't call an exterminator.

487
00:38:51,639 --> 00:38:54,759
I can't afford one.
I can't even afford my phone.

488
00:38:58,146 --> 00:38:59,225
I got fired.

489
00:38:59,772 --> 00:39:01,017
What?

490
00:39:01,858 --> 00:39:05,606
What do you mean, you got fired?
You're working so hard.

491
00:39:06,237 --> 00:39:07,696
Doesn't matter.

492
00:39:11,284 --> 00:39:13,953
Doesn't make one fucking bit
of difference.

493
00:39:28,718 --> 00:39:30,924
I don't know what happened to me.

494
00:39:35,225 --> 00:39:36,683
I <i>mean...</i>

495
00:39:37,685 --> 00:39:41,683
God, I was Miss Wichita,
for chrissake.

496
00:39:43,775 --> 00:39:45,020
Did I tell you that?

497
00:39:47,695 --> 00:39:52,737
You are living next door to a real,
live fucking beauty queen.

498
00:39:58,039 --> 00:40:00,447
I still have my tiara.

499
00:40:03,002 --> 00:40:08,127
And I thought it meant I was gonna
do something important with my life.

500
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:10,376
That it meant I was someone.

501
00:40:17,767 --> 00:40:19,427
You're someone to me.

502
00:40:29,529 --> 00:40:32,980
Are you gonna be something else
that I have to survive?

503
00:40:34,742 --> 00:40:36,735
Because I'll tell you the truth...

504
00:40:39,205 --> 00:40:40,913
...I'm not up to it.

505
00:41:23,249 --> 00:41:25,740
I get up in the centre of the stage...

506
00:41:26,002 --> 00:41:28,458
...and I have the big
bouquet of flowers.

507
00:41:28,713 --> 00:41:31,286
I had my foot out like this,
and I said:

508
00:41:31,549 --> 00:41:35,167
"I will devote my entire reign
as Miss Wichita...

509
00:41:35,428 --> 00:41:37,884
...to bringing an end to world hunger.

510
00:41:38,306 --> 00:41:41,177
And to the creation
of a peaceful earth...

511
00:41:41,434 --> 00:41:44,008
...for every man, woman and child."

512
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:48,220
- How long were you Miss Wichita?
- One year.

513
00:41:48,483 --> 00:41:51,603
By the time I got through
opening new supermarkets...

514
00:41:51,861 --> 00:41:55,396
...I only had a few weeks left
to work on hunger...

515
00:41:55,657 --> 00:41:57,649
...and world peace.
- World peace.

516
00:41:57,867 --> 00:42:00,323
I don't know what I was thinking.

517
00:42:01,496 --> 00:42:03,488
What about you, huh?

518
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:05,367
What about me?

519
00:42:11,798 --> 00:42:13,707
Let me tell you something.

520
00:42:14,217 --> 00:42:16,210
Let me get that out of your hair.

521
00:42:17,804 --> 00:42:20,176
- Thank you.
- Nice.

522
00:42:26,604 --> 00:42:28,727
You're a very special lady.

523
00:42:34,863 --> 00:42:36,689
Don't be too nice to me, okay?

524
00:42:36,948 --> 00:42:38,323
Why?

525
00:42:39,158 --> 00:42:41,032
Makes me nervous.

526
00:42:54,048 --> 00:42:56,456
It's some slim pickings here, baby.

527
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:02,965
Maybe that's Ed McMahon.
Let's go see.

528
00:43:09,689 --> 00:43:10,732
Wrong Ed.

529
00:43:11,774 --> 00:43:13,269
What are you doing here?

530
00:43:13,526 --> 00:43:17,191
I had an interesting call
this afternoon from Dr. Frankel...

531
00:43:17,488 --> 00:43:19,528
...from UCLA.
- Oh, yeah?

532
00:43:19,782 --> 00:43:24,112
He wanted you to know that the " legal
limit for hexavalent chromium...

533
00:43:24,621 --> 00:43:28,832
...is.05 parts per million...

534
00:43:29,083 --> 00:43:32,666
...and at the rate you mentioned,
.58, it could be...

535
00:43:32,921 --> 00:43:37,464
...responsible for the cancers"
in that family you asked about...

536
00:43:37,842 --> 00:43:39,420
...the Jensens.

537
00:43:40,011 --> 00:43:42,584
Well. Wasn't that nice of him?

538
00:43:42,847 --> 00:43:46,927
Funny how some people help people,
and others just fire them.

539
00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:51,094
I'm sorry. You were gone.
I assumed you were off having fun.

540
00:43:52,315 --> 00:43:55,020
Why the hell would you assume that?

541
00:43:55,276 --> 00:43:58,361
Maybe you look like someone
who has a lot of fun.

542
00:43:58,571 --> 00:44:01,406
By that standard,
I assume you never get laid.

543
00:44:03,826 --> 00:44:04,869
I'm married.

544
00:44:06,955 --> 00:44:11,498
Look, what is this... What's the story
on this cancer stuff?

545
00:44:14,963 --> 00:44:18,830
You wanna know, you have to hire me
back. I got a ton of bills to pay.

546
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:21,755
Fine.

547
00:44:22,512 --> 00:44:23,555
Fine.

548
00:44:24,264 --> 00:44:28,012
Donna just put in these new cabinets,
stained the wood and all...

549
00:44:28,268 --> 00:44:31,968
...when she gets a call from PG and E,
saying a freeway's gonna be built...

550
00:44:32,188 --> 00:44:35,106
...and they wanna buy her house
for an off-ramp.

551
00:44:35,608 --> 00:44:37,815
The husband's sick with Hodgkin's.

552
00:44:38,027 --> 00:44:39,570
She keeps getting tumours...

553
00:44:39,779 --> 00:44:42,650
...believing one has nothing
to do with the other.

554
00:44:42,907 --> 00:44:45,149
Because PG and E told her
about the chromium?

555
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:47,118
They had a seminar.

556
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:49,695
They invited 200 people
from the area...

557
00:44:49,956 --> 00:44:51,699
...had it at the plant...

558
00:44:51,958 --> 00:44:54,829
...about chromium three
and how good it is...

559
00:44:55,086 --> 00:44:57,244
...when they're using chromium six.

560
00:44:58,423 --> 00:45:02,467
That document you found
at the water board...

561
00:45:02,719 --> 00:45:06,669
...the one that says
about the bad <i>chromium...</i>

562
00:45:07,682 --> 00:45:10,303
You didn't happen to make a copy,
did you?

563
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,054
Of course I did.

564
00:45:12,937 --> 00:45:14,218
Could I have a look?

565
00:45:14,772 --> 00:45:16,315
I want a raise.

566
00:45:16,566 --> 00:45:20,480
And benefits, including dental.

567
00:45:21,696 --> 00:45:23,356
It's not how I do business.

568
00:45:23,573 --> 00:45:25,197
- What way is that?
- Extortion.

569
00:45:32,916 --> 00:45:35,585
A 5% raise, we'll talk
about benefits later.

570
00:45:36,085 --> 00:45:40,831
Ten. There are lots of other places
I could get work.

571
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:46,382
10% raise and benefits, but that's it.
I'm drawing the line.

572
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,388
He's drawing the line.

573
00:45:59,817 --> 00:46:01,525
This the only thing you got?

574
00:46:01,736 --> 00:46:04,820
Well, the place is a pigsty.
There's probably more.

575
00:46:05,073 --> 00:46:07,315
I know how those things are run.

576
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:11,658
What makes you think
you can just walk in there...

577
00:46:11,913 --> 00:46:14,830
...and find what we need?

578
00:46:15,792 --> 00:46:17,784
They're called boobs, Ed.

579
00:46:34,143 --> 00:46:36,266
Yes, I'm sure it is.

580
00:46:37,522 --> 00:46:38,720
I understand.

581
00:46:40,191 --> 00:46:41,983
I agree. I agree. I'm going to.

582
00:46:42,235 --> 00:46:43,350
Right now.

583
00:46:51,286 --> 00:46:52,696
I'm almost done. Look.

584
00:46:53,621 --> 00:46:55,246
How are we doing?

585
00:46:55,498 --> 00:46:57,123
We're doing great.

586
00:46:59,085 --> 00:47:00,496
Good.

587
00:47:00,753 --> 00:47:04,621
Well, you've got quite a lot
done already. <i>So...</i>

588
00:47:06,467 --> 00:47:09,255
Sorry, we need to have
those records back now.

589
00:47:09,721 --> 00:47:10,883
No.

590
00:47:14,058 --> 00:47:16,976
These papers are public record.
I'm not leaving...

591
00:47:17,228 --> 00:47:20,680
...until they're copied.

592
00:47:33,828 --> 00:47:36,746
Fax these to this number, okay?

593
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,246
- All of them?
- All of them.

594
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:02,806
An on-site monitoring well?

595
00:48:03,066 --> 00:48:06,102
- That means it was...
- It's on the PG and E property.

596
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:12,195
And you say that this stuff,
this hexavalent <i>chromium...</i>

597
00:48:13,243 --> 00:48:15,734
- Well, it's poisonous.
- Yeah.

598
00:48:23,503 --> 00:48:28,129
It's gotta be different than what's
in our water, because ours is okay.

599
00:48:28,341 --> 00:48:31,176
The guys from PG and E told me.

600
00:48:31,386 --> 00:48:35,134
They sat right in the kitchen
and told me that it was fine.

601
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:40,553
I know. But the toxicologist
that I've been talking to...

602
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:45,562
...he gave me a list of problems that
come from hexavalent chromium exposure.

603
00:48:45,817 --> 00:48:49,102
Everything you all have
is on that list.

604
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,811
No, no, no.

605
00:48:53,992 --> 00:48:58,488
That's not what...
That's not what our doctor said.

606
00:48:58,705 --> 00:49:00,365
He said <i>that...</i>

607
00:49:01,624 --> 00:49:05,159
Well, that one's got absolutely
nothing to do with the other.

608
00:49:06,713 --> 00:49:09,334
But PG and E paid for that doctor.

609
00:49:30,653 --> 00:49:31,851
Ashley!

610
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:34,607
Shanna!
Get out of the pool!

611
00:49:34,866 --> 00:49:37,404
- How come?
- I said so, that's why.

612
00:49:44,042 --> 00:49:46,284
The minute Brenda sent that fax...

613
00:49:46,544 --> 00:49:50,624
...I'm saying, the second she
pressed the "send" button...

614
00:49:52,133 --> 00:49:56,261
...PG and E's claim department
was on the phone to me...

615
00:49:56,513 --> 00:49:58,256
...scheduling a meeting.

616
00:49:58,515 --> 00:50:00,756
So you think that...
Let me do it.

617
00:50:01,017 --> 00:50:02,725
You're driving me nuts.

618
00:50:02,936 --> 00:50:04,513
You think we scared them?

619
00:50:04,771 --> 00:50:07,096
Taking the trouble to send someone...

620
00:50:07,315 --> 00:50:10,766
...sounds like they're
sitting up and taking notice.

621
00:50:26,376 --> 00:50:27,455
Mr. Foil?

622
00:50:29,462 --> 00:50:31,953
In the interest
of putting this to rest...

623
00:50:32,173 --> 00:50:36,634
...PG and E is willing to offer
the Jensens $250,000 for their home.

624
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:38,714
$250,000?

625
00:50:39,889 --> 00:50:42,345
In terms of land value in Hinkley...

626
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:45,310
...we feel that's a more
than fair price.

627
00:50:45,687 --> 00:50:48,178
How about in terms
of medical expenses?

628
00:50:48,439 --> 00:50:53,018
$250,000 isn't gonna come close to what
this family's gonna spend on doctors.

629
00:50:54,696 --> 00:50:57,613
I understand they've had bad luck,
health-wise.

630
00:50:57,866 --> 00:50:59,573
They have my sympathies.

631
00:50:59,826 --> 00:51:01,320
But that's not PG and E's fault.

632
00:51:01,578 --> 00:51:03,321
You're kidding, right?

633
00:51:05,081 --> 00:51:06,955
Look at these readings.

634
00:51:07,167 --> 00:51:11,034
PG and E's own technicians documented...

635
00:51:11,296 --> 00:51:14,297
...toxic levels of hexavalent chromium
in those wells...

636
00:51:14,549 --> 00:51:16,755
...on numerous occasions.

637
00:51:16,968 --> 00:51:19,174
Everything the Jensens have had...

638
00:51:19,429 --> 00:51:24,470
...is proven reaction to exposure to
hexavalent chromium. They have <i>had...</i>

639
00:51:25,351 --> 00:51:26,976
They have <i>had...</i>

640
00:51:29,856 --> 00:51:34,269
Breast cysts, uterine cancer,
Hodgkin's, immune deficiencies...

641
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:35,772
...asthma, nosebleeds...

642
00:51:36,029 --> 00:51:38,484
A million things could
cause those problems.

643
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:43,069
Poor diet, bad genes,
irresponsible lifestyle.

644
00:51:43,286 --> 00:51:45,444
Our offer is final
and more than fair.

645
00:51:45,705 --> 00:51:48,872
Wait a minute.
I thought we were negotiating here.

646
00:51:51,794 --> 00:51:56,041
$250,000 is all
I'm authorized to offer.

647
00:51:58,092 --> 00:52:00,963
I'll present your offer to my clients.

648
00:52:01,221 --> 00:52:03,260
I doubt they'll accept.

649
00:52:05,016 --> 00:52:06,973
Before you go off on a crusade...

650
00:52:07,227 --> 00:52:09,552
...remember who you're dealing with.

651
00:52:09,812 --> 00:52:13,478
PG and E's a 28 billion
dollar corporation.

652
00:52:13,942 --> 00:52:16,859
28 billion dollars?

653
00:52:17,111 --> 00:52:19,318
I didn't know it was that much!

654
00:52:19,531 --> 00:52:23,824
Wow! Twenty-eight billion!

655
00:52:24,077 --> 00:52:26,200
Holy cow!

656
00:52:26,579 --> 00:52:27,658
They made an offer.

657
00:52:27,914 --> 00:52:31,614
No, a million would have been
an offer. They send that...

658
00:52:31,876 --> 00:52:35,079
...mail clerk down to jerk me off,
waste my time.

659
00:52:35,296 --> 00:52:36,339
Why?

660
00:52:36,673 --> 00:52:38,500
You heard what that kid said.

661
00:52:38,716 --> 00:52:43,129
They have 28 billion dollars.
They can afford to waste time.

662
00:52:43,388 --> 00:52:45,096
- You can't?
- Am I made of money?

663
00:52:45,348 --> 00:52:47,590
- Why are you yelling?
- I'm pissed.

664
00:52:49,853 --> 00:52:51,810
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you back!

665
00:53:01,906 --> 00:53:03,899
I really hate you sometimes.

666
00:53:04,367 --> 00:53:06,656
No. You love me.

667
00:53:18,423 --> 00:53:20,830
You've been reading for hours.

668
00:53:21,092 --> 00:53:22,919
I'm a slow reader.

669
00:53:53,458 --> 00:53:54,869
Excuse me.

670
00:53:55,084 --> 00:53:56,828
- Are you Erin Brockovich?
- Yeah.

671
00:53:57,837 --> 00:53:59,462
I'm Tom Robinson.

672
00:53:59,672 --> 00:54:01,499
This is my wife, Mandy.

673
00:54:01,716 --> 00:54:04,717
We used to live across
the street from the Jensens.

674
00:54:04,928 --> 00:54:07,169
I think you know Donna.

675
00:54:08,473 --> 00:54:11,509
PG and E bought our house last year.

676
00:54:12,894 --> 00:54:16,974
Well, the vet said they had
a bunch of tumours and stuff.

677
00:54:18,107 --> 00:54:20,859
Well, you can see
they couldn't really walk.

678
00:54:21,361 --> 00:54:23,234
How many were born like this?

679
00:54:24,155 --> 00:54:27,192
Twelve or 13 or so.

680
00:54:28,117 --> 00:54:31,533
When Donna told us what
you told her about the chromium...

681
00:54:31,746 --> 00:54:34,913
...we figured it might have
something to do with this.

682
00:54:35,124 --> 00:54:36,832
Yeah, it might.

683
00:54:37,043 --> 00:54:38,621
Really, may I keep these?

684
00:54:38,837 --> 00:54:40,082
- Yeah.
- Okay, great.

685
00:54:40,296 --> 00:54:43,463
Thank you so much.
I really appreciate it.

686
00:54:44,717 --> 00:54:46,342
There's something else too.

687
00:54:48,429 --> 00:54:49,509
What?

688
00:54:54,185 --> 00:54:56,890
Mandy, here, has had...

689
00:54:57,105 --> 00:54:59,726
...five miscarriages.

690
00:55:00,233 --> 00:55:01,348
I'm so sorry.

691
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:04,936
I figured it was something I did.

692
00:55:05,822 --> 00:55:08,443
Like, when I smoked marijuana,
maybe...

693
00:55:08,658 --> 00:55:11,066
...or took birth control pills...

694
00:55:11,286 --> 00:55:13,741
...but then Donna
said that you thought...

695
00:55:13,955 --> 00:55:17,122
...this chromium might be
to blame for her problems.

696
00:55:17,333 --> 00:55:19,326
So I figured maybe...

697
00:55:22,547 --> 00:55:23,958
...it wasn't just me.

698
00:55:41,232 --> 00:55:43,106
I have to take a bath.

699
00:55:43,693 --> 00:55:45,187
You should go in.

700
00:55:47,322 --> 00:55:48,946
They're not asleep?

701
00:55:52,452 --> 00:55:54,160
Beth and Katie are.

702
00:56:10,595 --> 00:56:13,549
- How was school?
- Fine.

703
00:56:14,224 --> 00:56:16,347
- Did you do your homework?
- Yeah.

704
00:56:19,062 --> 00:56:20,853
Any problems?

705
00:56:31,741 --> 00:56:35,406
I know you're upset,
but the way this job is...

706
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:39,700
...things come up at the last minute.
Things that I gotta deal with.

707
00:56:39,916 --> 00:56:41,992
Fine!

708
00:56:47,841 --> 00:56:49,833
Please don't be mad at me.

709
00:56:50,844 --> 00:56:54,426
I'm doing this for us. I know
it's hard for you to understand...

710
00:56:57,684 --> 00:57:00,435
...but don't you want Mommy
to be good at her job?

711
00:57:07,443 --> 00:57:11,311
I don't miss dinner all the time.
We all ate together last night.

712
00:57:11,531 --> 00:57:13,488
You were reading the whole time.

713
00:57:38,016 --> 00:57:42,013
There's something about this thing
I don't understand, Mr. Masry.

714
00:57:42,478 --> 00:57:45,183
If PG and E messed with our water...

715
00:57:45,398 --> 00:57:48,316
...why would they say anything
about it to us at all?

716
00:57:48,651 --> 00:57:50,443
Why not just keep quiet about it?

717
00:57:50,737 --> 00:57:52,776
To establish a statute of limitations.

718
00:57:52,989 --> 00:57:55,776
In a case like this,
you only have one year...

719
00:57:56,034 --> 00:57:59,153
...from the time you learn about
the problem to file suit.

720
00:57:59,787 --> 00:58:01,614
So PG and E figures...

721
00:58:01,831 --> 00:58:05,829
..."We'll let the cat out of the bag.
Tell them the water isn't perfect.

722
00:58:06,252 --> 00:58:09,087
If we can ride out the year
with no one suing...

723
00:58:09,297 --> 00:58:11,171
...we'll be in the clear forever."

724
00:58:11,841 --> 00:58:14,048
But they told us more than a year ago.

725
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:16,798
- That's okay. We're not suing.
- Not yet.

726
00:58:17,305 --> 00:58:20,140
All we're doing
is using this information...

727
00:58:20,350 --> 00:58:23,101
...to get you a nice purchase
price on your house.

728
00:58:23,311 --> 00:58:27,890
And you two, a comparable
retroactive bonus on your sale price.

729
00:58:28,107 --> 00:58:30,777
PG and E still looks good
to their shareholders.

730
00:58:30,985 --> 00:58:32,729
They're not in a lawsuit.

731
00:58:32,946 --> 00:58:35,353
All they're doing is buying property.

732
00:58:37,492 --> 00:58:40,327
Doesn't say how much
this thing's gonna cost us.

733
00:58:41,162 --> 00:58:44,448
My fee is 40% of whatever
you get awarded.

734
00:58:54,384 --> 00:58:56,626
Boy, do I know how you feel.

735
00:58:56,845 --> 00:59:00,593
The first time I heard that number,
I said, "You're kidding me."

736
00:59:00,807 --> 00:59:02,716
Forty goddamned percent?

737
00:59:02,934 --> 00:59:06,801
I'm the one that's injured, and
this joker sits at a desk all day...

738
00:59:07,021 --> 00:59:09,429
...and he wants
almost half of my reward?

739
00:59:09,649 --> 00:59:11,606
- Erin, can I...?
- But then...

740
00:59:12,318 --> 00:59:14,311
...I asked him...

741
00:59:14,529 --> 00:59:17,067
...what he makes
if I don't get anything.

742
00:59:18,616 --> 00:59:20,573
Then I don't get anything either.

743
00:59:21,286 --> 00:59:22,994
Plus, he's out all the costs.

744
00:59:23,621 --> 00:59:25,614
So I realized...

745
00:59:25,874 --> 00:59:27,498
...he's taking a chance too.

746
00:59:36,843 --> 00:59:38,337
You got a pen, honey?

747
00:59:44,142 --> 00:59:45,256
All right, then.

748
00:59:48,438 --> 00:59:50,430
Oh, I made a bundt cake.

749
00:59:50,732 --> 00:59:53,020
Who would like coffee and cake?

750
00:59:53,234 --> 00:59:55,476
- I do.
- Thanks, but we have to get back.

751
00:59:57,322 --> 00:59:59,610
Have a fucking cup of coffee, Ed.

752
00:59:59,824 --> 01:00:01,733
Coffee will be great. Thank you.

753
01:00:02,202 --> 01:00:04,408
- All right.
- I'll help you.

754
01:00:09,167 --> 01:00:11,705
My wife makes really good bundt cake.

755
01:00:12,086 --> 01:00:13,794
I love bundt cake.

756
01:00:16,758 --> 01:00:21,218
Well, it seems like everybody in
the family ended up with a rash somehow.

757
01:00:21,930 --> 01:00:25,429
It seemed like no matter what
we did, it always came back.

758
01:00:26,184 --> 01:00:28,342
Over what kind of period of time?

759
01:00:28,561 --> 01:00:32,559
Oh, long time, you know, years.
I never did keep track of it.

760
01:00:32,774 --> 01:00:35,894
Kids are sick.
Animals need to be fed.

761
01:00:36,110 --> 01:00:37,770
Just couldn't get rid of it.

762
01:00:39,405 --> 01:00:41,398
Well, Mrs. De Soto said...

763
01:00:41,824 --> 01:00:44,742
...that she wasn't
exactly sure what you had.

764
01:00:44,953 --> 01:00:46,198
We know what it is.

765
01:00:46,412 --> 01:00:49,663
- It's gastrointestinal...
- Gastrointestinal cancer.

766
01:00:49,874 --> 01:00:53,077
- She got sick about nine months ago...
- Nine months ago.

767
01:00:53,294 --> 01:00:56,165
And they operated on her
about six months ago.

768
01:00:56,381 --> 01:00:57,875
- The intestine.
- Right.

769
01:01:08,226 --> 01:01:11,346
- Hi. I'm Erin Brock...
- I know who you are.

770
01:01:11,563 --> 01:01:13,223
Donna called me.

771
01:01:14,566 --> 01:01:15,941
Can I come in?

772
01:01:16,401 --> 01:01:19,106
We're not interested
in getting involved.

773
01:01:21,364 --> 01:01:23,024
Can I ask why?

774
01:01:23,616 --> 01:01:25,324
What's the point?

775
01:01:27,579 --> 01:01:31,244
Donna told me that you've been sick
and that your kids were sick...

776
01:01:31,457 --> 01:01:34,079
You people don't give a shit.

777
01:01:34,544 --> 01:01:37,213
Anything to get what you want.

778
01:01:45,305 --> 01:01:46,680
<i>Thanks for having me...</i>

779
01:01:46,890 --> 01:01:49,725
It's a good day to come by.
She's feeling good.

780
01:01:49,934 --> 01:01:52,306
Well, Mike Ambrosino had remembered...

781
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:55,225
...that he had seen
you folks at the hospital.

782
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:57,267
That's what brought me out here.

783
01:01:59,277 --> 01:02:02,444
Yeah, we've been there
from time to time.

784
01:02:02,947 --> 01:02:05,521
And you! Wooftie!

785
01:02:05,742 --> 01:02:06,821
Ain't you a beauty?

786
01:02:07,535 --> 01:02:09,611
You drive all the boys
crazy, don't you?

787
01:02:09,829 --> 01:02:12,866
I can see it in your eyes.
You drive them wild.

788
01:02:13,249 --> 01:02:14,743
You do, don't you?

789
01:02:15,251 --> 01:02:16,414
Torture them.

790
01:02:16,628 --> 01:02:18,086
It's good for them.

791
01:02:20,215 --> 01:02:22,456
Don't teach her anything too early.

792
01:02:23,384 --> 01:02:26,220
Yeah, she can't wait
to get on her new dress.

793
01:02:26,429 --> 01:02:27,923
She wants to go to school.

794
01:02:28,139 --> 01:02:30,677
We're trying to do that,
in a few months.

795
01:02:30,892 --> 01:02:33,561
Yeah, get her out
of her nightgown here.

796
01:02:36,731 --> 01:02:38,522
She's gonna do it.

797
01:02:56,543 --> 01:02:57,788
Absolutely not.

798
01:02:58,002 --> 01:03:00,078
- Why not?
- Because I said no.

799
01:03:00,296 --> 01:03:02,372
The reason PG and E even talks to us...

800
01:03:02,590 --> 01:03:05,425
...is because this is a quiet
real-estate dispute.

801
01:03:05,718 --> 01:03:09,253
We add plaintiffs, we're in
the middle of a toxic-trot...

802
01:03:09,472 --> 01:03:12,343
...with a statute problem,
against a massive utility.

803
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:13,575
No, thank you.

804
01:03:13,679 --> 01:03:15,309
Okay, so here's what I'll do.

805
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:19,268
I'll go to the Daniels'
the nicest people you'll ever meet...

806
01:03:19,482 --> 01:03:22,602
...who watch their girl fight
like a dog against cancer.

807
01:03:22,819 --> 01:03:23,862
I'll tell them...

808
01:03:24,070 --> 01:03:27,902
...we can't help them, because you
just don't wanna work that hard.

809
01:03:28,324 --> 01:03:29,605
Work hard?

810
01:03:29,826 --> 01:03:31,735
Let me tell you something.

811
01:03:31,953 --> 01:03:33,447
I've worked all my life.

812
01:03:33,663 --> 01:03:37,957
I've built a firm and kept it alive
through lawsuits and injunctions.

813
01:03:38,251 --> 01:03:41,252
I've survived
a quadruple bypass, cancer...

814
01:03:41,462 --> 01:03:43,918
...being born with one
kidney and diabetes.

815
01:03:44,132 --> 01:03:46,919
I personally managed
to save a million dollars...

816
01:03:47,135 --> 01:03:49,804
...over 30 years, getting
clients 10 times that.

817
01:03:50,013 --> 01:03:52,219
Don't tell me I don't work hard!

818
01:03:52,432 --> 01:03:55,967
Don't tell me I can't stop,
take a breath and enjoy life.

819
01:03:56,186 --> 01:03:58,677
What the hell do you know
about any of this?

820
01:03:59,105 --> 01:04:02,106
Something like this, Erin,
it could take forever.

821
01:04:02,317 --> 01:04:04,025
They're a huge corporation!

822
01:04:04,235 --> 01:04:06,394
They'll bury us
in paperwork for years.

823
01:04:06,613 --> 01:04:09,068
I'm just a guy with
a small, private firm!

824
01:04:10,283 --> 01:04:13,367
Who knows they poisoned
people and lied about it.

825
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:15,579
We can get these people.

826
01:04:15,788 --> 01:04:19,620
With a little effort, I think we
can nail their asses to the wall.

827
01:04:19,834 --> 01:04:22,242
With your legal expertise,
you believe that?

828
01:04:22,462 --> 01:04:25,167
- Don't you ever just know?
- Do you know about money?

829
01:04:25,381 --> 01:04:27,041
They settle due to lack of money.

830
01:04:27,258 --> 01:04:30,544
You know what toxicologists
and geology experts cost?

831
01:04:30,762 --> 01:04:32,636
We're looking at $100,000 a month.

832
01:04:32,847 --> 01:04:36,050
- I've already spent some of my savings.
- We'll figure it out.

833
01:04:36,267 --> 01:04:40,217
I don't know shit, but I know the
difference between right and wrong!

834
01:04:40,438 --> 01:04:43,309
- Lovers' quarrel?
- Bite my ass, Krispy Kreme.

835
01:04:47,904 --> 01:04:49,564
I feel you looking at me.

836
01:04:53,243 --> 01:04:55,319
I'm sorry.

837
01:04:57,413 --> 01:04:59,904
How many families are we talking about?

838
01:05:00,124 --> 01:05:02,698
Four more. Eleven people so far.

839
01:05:02,919 --> 01:05:03,962
There's more?

840
01:05:04,337 --> 01:05:09,462
I found a document at the water board,
a toxic test well reading from 1967.

841
01:05:09,801 --> 01:05:12,256
More people have lived
there since then.

842
01:05:13,137 --> 01:05:16,969
This is a whole different ball game.
A much bigger deal.

843
01:05:17,934 --> 01:05:20,686
Kind of like David
and what's -his-name.

844
01:05:22,522 --> 01:05:26,472
Kind of like David and what's -
his-name's whole fucking family.

845
01:05:28,152 --> 01:05:30,026
Here's the deal.

846
01:05:30,238 --> 01:05:35,149
If, and only if, you find all the
evidence to back this up, I'll do it.

847
01:05:35,410 --> 01:05:36,987
You're doing the right thing.

848
01:05:37,203 --> 01:05:41,415
Remind me of that when
I'm filing for bankruptcy.

849
01:05:43,168 --> 01:05:47,082
Of course, gathering
evidence is a big job.

850
01:05:47,297 --> 01:05:49,585
Hell of a lot bigger than just filing.

851
01:05:49,799 --> 01:05:51,507
I'll be working a lot harder...

852
01:05:51,718 --> 01:05:54,635
...taking on a lot
more responsibility.

853
01:05:54,846 --> 01:05:57,301
- I don't believe this.
- A raise wouldn't hurt.

854
01:05:57,515 --> 01:05:59,223
I'll spend more time in my car...

855
01:05:59,434 --> 01:06:02,803
...so I'll probably be needing
one of those cell phones.

856
01:06:03,521 --> 01:06:06,641
- I don't believe this.
- Just a little phone.

857
01:07:15,009 --> 01:07:16,504
Thank you!

858
01:07:23,685 --> 01:07:26,140
<i>Whoever is behind you.</i>

859
01:07:27,146 --> 01:07:28,261
Just play.

860
01:07:28,481 --> 01:07:31,933
Go, roll the dice and play.

861
01:07:33,987 --> 01:07:36,193
Come on, aren't you gonna play?

862
01:07:36,406 --> 01:07:38,564
Roll the dice.

863
01:07:38,783 --> 01:07:40,242
Come on.

864
01:07:43,663 --> 01:07:44,706
Hello.

865
01:07:44,914 --> 01:07:49,457
<i>Is this the Erin Brockovich that's</i>
<i>been snooping around the water board?</i>

866
01:07:49,669 --> 01:07:50,997
Yeah. Who's this?

867
01:07:51,212 --> 01:07:52,671
<i>You should watch your step.</i>

868
01:07:52,881 --> 01:07:56,878
<i>A young lady with three young</i>
<i>children really should think again.</i>

869
01:07:57,093 --> 01:07:58,136
Who is this?

870
01:07:59,137 --> 01:08:01,758
<i>Do you understand what I'm saying?</i>

871
01:08:08,188 --> 01:08:09,230
<i>Who is it?</i>

872
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:12,434
<i>It's okay.</i>

873
01:08:14,485 --> 01:08:18,614
I'm not gonna quit because of
one creepy phone call, George.

874
01:08:18,823 --> 01:08:20,317
Come on, Erin.

875
01:08:21,451 --> 01:08:23,194
A job shouldn't put you in danger.

876
01:08:23,411 --> 01:08:24,526
I'm not in danger.

877
01:08:24,746 --> 01:08:27,201
- The phone might be tapped but...
- What?

878
01:08:27,415 --> 01:08:30,784
That's usual. We've got a dead
bolt, it's not a big deal.

879
01:08:31,419 --> 01:08:34,586
You don't think you're
a little out of your league?

880
01:08:34,797 --> 01:08:37,917
That's what those PG and E
fucks want me to think.

881
01:08:38,134 --> 01:08:39,379
But they're wrong.

882
01:08:39,594 --> 01:08:42,299
Erin, there are plenty
of jobs out there.

883
01:08:42,514 --> 01:08:44,091
How would you know?

884
01:08:53,566 --> 01:08:55,358
What that's supposed to mean?

885
01:08:55,568 --> 01:08:58,984
You got a problem with me caring
for your kids instead of a job?

886
01:08:59,197 --> 01:09:00,359
I can get a job.

887
01:09:00,573 --> 01:09:03,658
You can leave the kids with
the chicken-fat lady again.

888
01:09:03,868 --> 01:09:06,193
I said I'm sorry.
Keep your voice down.

889
01:09:06,412 --> 01:09:09,947
I know what these kids can
sleep through, better than you.

890
01:09:23,972 --> 01:09:26,011
Scott, tell me something.

891
01:09:26,224 --> 01:09:28,549
Does PG and E pay you
to cover their ass?

892
01:09:28,768 --> 01:09:31,852
Or do you just do it out
of the kindness of your heart?

893
01:09:32,313 --> 01:09:34,851
I don't know what
you're talking about.

894
01:09:35,066 --> 01:09:36,809
Nobody calls me Pattee.

895
01:09:37,026 --> 01:09:41,439
That sicko that called could've
only found out about me from you.

896
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:43,818
People are dying, Scott.

897
01:09:44,033 --> 01:09:46,109
You've got document after document...

898
01:09:46,327 --> 01:09:50,195
...that says why, and you
haven't said one word about it.

899
01:09:51,624 --> 01:09:54,542
I wanna know how the hell
you sleep at night.

900
01:10:14,856 --> 01:10:18,984
I'm about to drive off the road,
I'm so tired. Keep me awake.

901
01:10:20,528 --> 01:10:21,904
What do you want, a joke?

902
01:10:22,739 --> 01:10:25,444
No, I don't want a joke.

903
01:10:25,950 --> 01:10:28,276
Tell me about what went on back there.

904
01:10:30,038 --> 01:10:33,157
Come to think of it,
we had a big event around here.

905
01:10:35,210 --> 01:10:38,246
Beth started talking.

906
01:10:40,673 --> 01:10:41,716
What?

907
01:10:43,468 --> 01:10:45,425
Beth? My Beth?

908
01:10:45,637 --> 01:10:46,965
<i>We were sitting around...</i>

909
01:10:47,972 --> 01:10:50,677
...and she pointed
at a ball and said:

910
01:10:51,392 --> 01:10:52,555
"Ball."

911
01:10:53,686 --> 01:10:55,229
Out of the blue like that.

912
01:10:58,066 --> 01:10:59,726
<i>It was pretty intense.</i>

913
01:10:59,943 --> 01:11:02,231
<i>You know, seeing</i>
<i>somebody's first word.</i>

914
01:11:02,445 --> 01:11:07,356
<i>Of all the words in her life,</i>
<i>that's the first word she says: "ball."</i>

915
01:11:09,953 --> 01:11:12,159
<i>She pointed her little finger...</i>

916
01:11:12,956 --> 01:11:15,910
<i>... with her beautiful, soft,</i>
<i>chubby little arm...</i>

917
01:11:16,668 --> 01:11:17,866
<i>... and her cheeks.</i>

918
01:11:18,086 --> 01:11:20,956
<i>It's like she'd been</i>
<i>looking at it for months...</i>

919
01:11:21,172 --> 01:11:24,257
<i>... and couldn't get it out,</i>
<i>but knowing what it was.</i>

920
01:11:24,467 --> 01:11:26,590
<i>She didn't look away or anything.</i>

921
01:11:26,803 --> 01:11:29,341
<i>She was just sitting</i>
<i>there with her arm out.</i>

922
01:11:29,556 --> 01:11:32,343
<i>You should've seen</i>
<i>Matthew and Katie and me.</i>

923
01:11:32,559 --> 01:11:34,101
<i>Our jaws just dropped.</i>

924
01:11:34,310 --> 01:11:38,474
<i>We must've stood there for three or</i>
<i>four minutes and just looked at her.</i>

925
01:11:38,690 --> 01:11:41,856
<i>She just had her arm out</i>
<i>like that. "Ball."</i>

926
01:11:42,068 --> 01:11:44,903
<i>And, you know, her little</i>
<i>lips wrapped around it.</i>

927
01:11:46,823 --> 01:11:48,234
<i>It was great.</i>

928
01:11:48,449 --> 01:11:50,109
<i>It was intense.</i>

929
01:11:57,584 --> 01:12:00,501
I brought some stuff that
you might be interested in.

930
01:12:00,712 --> 01:12:03,748
My name's Erin, and
I'll be here all day.

931
01:12:03,965 --> 01:12:06,254
Let's go over to these
nice ladies. Hi.

932
01:12:06,467 --> 01:12:07,843
- How are you?
- Good.

933
01:12:08,052 --> 01:12:11,967
I brought some information today,
if you wanna have a look at it.

934
01:12:12,182 --> 01:12:14,589
If you have any
questions, let me know.

935
01:12:14,809 --> 01:12:17,644
Hi. Excuse me, ladies, I'm Ed Masry.

936
01:12:17,854 --> 01:12:21,686
I'm the lawyer involved in the case.
You might like to read these.

937
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:24,141
If you have questions,
I'm here all day.

938
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:26,816
- Sounds good. Thank you.
- Thanks so much.

939
01:12:27,864 --> 01:12:29,406
Is your phone number in this?

940
01:12:30,533 --> 01:12:33,487
There's more important
information than that in there.

941
01:12:35,038 --> 01:12:36,283
I'm bored.

942
01:12:36,498 --> 01:12:37,956
So are the kids.

943
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,625
I'm a little busy, honey.

944
01:12:40,835 --> 01:12:43,124
We invited these people.
Ed and I have to...

945
01:12:43,338 --> 01:12:45,211
I'm sorry. You know what?

946
01:12:45,465 --> 01:12:47,339
Please, I have an idea.

947
01:12:47,550 --> 01:12:48,926
Can you take her?

948
01:12:49,135 --> 01:12:52,469
She's getting heavy, and I'll
work faster if you take her.

949
01:13:03,399 --> 01:13:04,680
Got a knee for me?

950
01:13:06,236 --> 01:13:08,394
- Hello.
- Hello, sweetness.

951
01:13:08,613 --> 01:13:10,273
- Guess what?
- What?

952
01:13:10,490 --> 01:13:12,317
I would like to go home.

953
01:13:12,534 --> 01:13:13,561
Everything's done?

954
01:13:13,665 --> 01:13:14,863
We got a lot done.

955
01:13:15,078 --> 01:13:17,699
Did you? I think
I ate three watermelons.

956
01:13:17,914 --> 01:13:18,957
Piggyback!

957
01:13:19,165 --> 01:13:20,707
Let's go, brother. Get on.

958
01:13:20,917 --> 01:13:22,376
Careful.

959
01:13:22,585 --> 01:13:24,044
Here, get on me, now.

960
01:13:24,254 --> 01:13:26,330
Erin, excuse me.

961
01:13:26,548 --> 01:13:29,667
This is Nelson Perez, he works
at the compressor station.

962
01:13:29,884 --> 01:13:32,256
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- PG and E.

963
01:13:32,470 --> 01:13:34,178
Oh, hi.

964
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:37,549
- I've come at a bad time.
- No.

965
01:13:37,767 --> 01:13:40,851
- Can you just give me one...?
- Of course. Sure.

966
01:13:41,062 --> 01:13:42,722
Thank you.

967
01:13:45,733 --> 01:13:46,776
You know what?

968
01:13:46,943 --> 01:13:50,941
Why don't you guys go ahead without
me, and I'll get a ride with Ed.

969
01:13:51,155 --> 01:13:54,275
- No, Mom.
- No, sweetie, I'll be right behind you.

970
01:13:54,492 --> 01:13:56,568
I'll be right behind you, all right?

971
01:13:56,911 --> 01:14:01,704
- I really... This is so...
- Fine. Go, go, go.

972
01:14:05,128 --> 01:14:06,705
Get down, bud.

973
01:14:10,842 --> 01:14:12,217
Hang on tight there.

974
01:14:12,427 --> 01:14:14,834
Help your sister
with her shoes. Let's go.

975
01:14:31,821 --> 01:14:35,071
This is so helpful.
Is it okay if I write this down?

976
01:14:35,283 --> 01:14:36,694
I have so many questions.

977
01:14:36,910 --> 01:14:42,634
I wanna know about how the plant works
and the cooling towers, just everything.

978
01:14:42,738 --> 01:14:46,831
They use the hexachrome here, in these
cooling towers, as an anticorrosive.

979
01:14:47,086 --> 01:14:50,087
Then they dump the excess
water into these ponds.

980
01:14:50,465 --> 01:14:53,252
I don't remember seeing
any ponds up there.

981
01:14:53,468 --> 01:14:56,422
They've been covered over,
and not too carefully.

982
01:14:56,638 --> 01:14:59,176
If you dig one inch
under the surface...

983
01:14:59,390 --> 01:15:01,513
...dirt's as green
as a fucking shamrock.

984
01:15:01,726 --> 01:15:04,217
And that's what
caused the contamination?

985
01:15:04,437 --> 01:15:08,269
It didn't help, but no.
The problem started on the bottom.

986
01:15:08,566 --> 01:15:10,606
According to...

987
01:15:12,529 --> 01:15:14,106
...this...

988
01:15:14,322 --> 01:15:16,943
...in most cases you would
line these ponds...

989
01:15:17,158 --> 01:15:19,447
...so the shit didn't seep
into the ground.

990
01:15:20,078 --> 01:15:23,529
- But guess what?
- They skipped that step?

991
01:15:23,915 --> 01:15:26,620
Here are the ponds,
the plume comes down...

992
01:15:26,835 --> 01:15:29,123
...and Hinkley is down here...

993
01:15:29,337 --> 01:15:32,753
...it's 14 years of hexachrome
flowing into the groundwater.

994
01:15:33,550 --> 01:15:34,795
Jesus.

995
01:15:35,844 --> 01:15:38,381
This guy just offered
all this information?

996
01:15:38,930 --> 01:15:41,884
Well, yeah. Nelson cares
what's in those ponds.

997
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:45,683
He used to spend time wading
around them. That was his job.

998
01:15:45,895 --> 01:15:47,093
Shit.

999
01:15:54,612 --> 01:15:55,655
What's the matter?

1000
01:15:58,032 --> 01:16:00,440
I don't know if we can pull this off.

1001
01:16:01,578 --> 01:16:05,527
This is a monster case.
We're up to 411 plaintiffs.

1002
01:16:05,748 --> 01:16:10,624
We've taken 162 declarations.

1003
01:16:10,837 --> 01:16:14,420
Probably hundreds more
out there have moved away.

1004
01:16:14,716 --> 01:16:17,004
We have to find them,
it's taking time.

1005
01:16:17,218 --> 01:16:19,294
Money's going out,
nothing's coming in.

1006
01:16:19,512 --> 01:16:21,505
I have to take a second mortgage.

1007
01:16:21,723 --> 01:16:23,431
- So?
- So!

1008
01:16:26,811 --> 01:16:28,389
I have to tell you.

1009
01:16:29,189 --> 01:16:33,056
I've been making inquiries
with other firms...

1010
01:16:33,276 --> 01:16:36,727
...bigger firms to share
some of the cost.

1011
01:16:37,238 --> 01:16:39,646
They all said no,
said they don't have it.

1012
01:16:41,784 --> 01:16:43,492
We got PG and E by the balls.

1013
01:16:43,703 --> 01:16:47,867
PG and E Hinkley, but nobody'll get rich
unless we pin this on Corporate...

1014
01:16:48,082 --> 01:16:50,158
...in San Francisco.
- What do you mean?

1015
01:16:50,376 --> 01:16:53,627
PG and E Corporate claims they
didn't know about Hinkley.

1016
01:16:53,838 --> 01:16:55,878
They knew. They had to know.

1017
01:16:56,090 --> 01:16:57,834
Show me the document to prove it.

1018
01:17:00,803 --> 01:17:04,932
Then they didn't know. If so, we
can't hit them with punitive damages.

1019
01:17:05,141 --> 01:17:08,593
With punitive damages,
it's a sum of money that can...

1020
01:17:08,811 --> 01:17:12,809
...have some effect
on these people's lives.

1021
01:17:14,150 --> 01:17:15,525
So what do we do now?

1022
01:17:20,073 --> 01:17:24,651
Let's assume there are documents
connecting PG and E Hinkley and Corporate...

1023
01:17:24,869 --> 01:17:26,529
...and they know about them.

1024
01:17:27,038 --> 01:17:31,581
We take our 400 or so plaintiffs
and everything you've dug up...

1025
01:17:31,876 --> 01:17:34,248
...we file a lawsuit
to provoke a reaction.

1026
01:17:34,462 --> 01:17:38,460
See if they offer a reasonable
settlement, or throw more paper at us.

1027
01:17:38,967 --> 01:17:40,544
Sounds great. Let's do that.

1028
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:41,958
There's a downside.

1029
01:17:43,304 --> 01:17:45,760
PG and E will submit a demurrer.

1030
01:17:45,974 --> 01:17:48,215
A list attacking each complaint...

1031
01:17:48,434 --> 01:17:51,270
...claiming that each cause
of action has no merit.

1032
01:17:51,479 --> 01:17:53,638
And if the judge agrees with them...

1033
01:17:53,857 --> 01:17:57,308
...he'll dismiss our case.
PG and E will have no reason to settle.

1034
01:17:58,152 --> 01:17:59,944
Then it's all over.

1035
01:18:05,994 --> 01:18:08,282
So basically it all comes down to...

1036
01:18:08,496 --> 01:18:11,581
...what this one judge decides.

1037
01:18:12,750 --> 01:18:14,328
Basically, yeah.

1038
01:18:15,545 --> 01:18:17,039
Jesus.

1039
01:19:00,715 --> 01:19:03,751
Well, I'd got so used
to having them come up benign.

1040
01:19:05,595 --> 01:19:08,549
Guess I just didn't expect it.

1041
01:19:09,807 --> 01:19:13,342
I sure wish I would've had longer
to get used to the idea.

1042
01:19:16,940 --> 01:19:19,063
You think if you got no uterus...

1043
01:19:19,275 --> 01:19:22,691
...and no breasts...

1044
01:19:22,904 --> 01:19:25,691
...you're still technically a woman?

1045
01:19:27,408 --> 01:19:29,448
Sure you are.

1046
01:19:29,661 --> 01:19:31,452
Yeah, you just...

1047
01:19:31,663 --> 01:19:34,236
You're actually a happier woman.

1048
01:19:34,457 --> 01:19:37,493
No need to worry
about maxi-pads and underwire.

1049
01:19:45,051 --> 01:19:46,842
We're gonna get them, aren't we?

1050
01:19:47,220 --> 01:19:50,256
You gotta promise me
that we're gonna get them.

1051
01:20:06,489 --> 01:20:09,526
<i>I have before me</i>
<i>a complaint on behalf of residents...</i>

1052
01:20:12,662 --> 01:20:16,826
<i>... of Hinkley, California, who</i>
<i>have filed against PG and E.</i>

1053
01:20:17,041 --> 01:20:20,042
For damages, medical expenses
and personal trauma...

1054
01:20:20,253 --> 01:20:24,962
...due to contamination of the ground
water in their area by the defendant.

1055
01:20:25,675 --> 01:20:28,925
And I have here 84 motions
to strike and demurrers...

1056
01:20:29,137 --> 01:20:33,087
...submitted by representatives
of Pacific Gas and Electric.

1057
01:20:33,308 --> 01:20:36,511
Each one attacking
the validity of this complaint.

1058
01:20:37,395 --> 01:20:40,729
I have reviewed all of
the information carefully.

1059
01:20:41,232 --> 01:20:43,308
I'm ready to give my decision.

1060
01:20:43,526 --> 01:20:46,527
Before I do, is there
anything anyone wants to say?

1061
01:20:47,572 --> 01:20:50,193
- No, Your Honour.
- No, Your Honour.

1062
01:20:51,367 --> 01:20:52,612
Very well.

1063
01:20:52,911 --> 01:20:57,619
In the matter of the plaintiffs
of Hinkley, California vs. PG and E...

1064
01:20:57,832 --> 01:21:02,044
...it is the order of this court that
each of the 84 motions to strike...

1065
01:21:02,253 --> 01:21:04,875
...and demurrers are denied.

1066
01:21:05,089 --> 01:21:09,917
And the causes of action against
Pacific Gas and Electric are upheld.

1067
01:21:10,762 --> 01:21:12,304
On a more personal note...

1068
01:21:12,931 --> 01:21:16,975
...as a resident here in Barstow,
which is not far from Hinkley...

1069
01:21:17,185 --> 01:21:19,676
...I am disturbed by reference...

1070
01:21:19,896 --> 01:21:24,807
...to evidence that suggests that not
only was hexavalent chromium used...

1071
01:21:25,026 --> 01:21:29,487
...but that your clients
actually sent these residents...

1072
01:21:29,697 --> 01:21:32,734
...pamphlets telling them
that it was good for them.

1073
01:21:33,993 --> 01:21:36,116
Tell your clients
they're going to trial.

1074
01:21:47,882 --> 01:21:51,049
Jesus. They look
like the Secret Service.

1075
01:21:51,845 --> 01:21:53,636
Intimidation.

1076
01:21:55,473 --> 01:21:57,596
Let the games begin.

1077
01:21:57,892 --> 01:22:00,099
Show them into the conference room.

1078
01:22:02,397 --> 01:22:04,140
Donald, Anna...

1079
01:22:05,358 --> 01:22:07,600
...I wanna talk to you for a minute.

1080
01:22:12,198 --> 01:22:13,361
Counsellors.

1081
01:22:13,575 --> 01:22:14,617
Counsellors.

1082
01:22:22,083 --> 01:22:23,126
Let's be honest.

1083
01:22:23,751 --> 01:22:27,167
$20,000,000 is more than
these people have ever dreamed of.

1084
01:22:28,506 --> 01:22:30,214
Now that pisses me off.

1085
01:22:31,176 --> 01:22:34,960
First of all, since the demurrer,
we have more than 400 plaintiffs.

1086
01:22:35,180 --> 01:22:37,468
Let's be honest, we know there's more.

1087
01:22:37,724 --> 01:22:40,927
They may not be sophisticated,
but they can divide...

1088
01:22:41,144 --> 01:22:44,061
...and $20,000,000
isn't shit after splitting it.

1089
01:22:44,272 --> 01:22:45,351
Second of all...

1090
01:22:45,565 --> 01:22:47,522
...they don't dream of being rich.

1091
01:22:47,734 --> 01:22:50,604
They dream about
watching their kids in a pool...

1092
01:22:50,820 --> 01:22:54,403
...without worrying that
they'll have a hysterectomy at 20.

1093
01:22:54,616 --> 01:22:56,407
Like Rosa Diaz, our client.

1094
01:22:56,701 --> 01:23:01,280
Or have their spine deteriorate, like
Stan Bloom, another client of ours.

1095
01:23:01,498 --> 01:23:05,329
So before you come back here
with another lame-ass offer...

1096
01:23:05,543 --> 01:23:09,458
...I want you to think real
hard about what your spine is worth.

1097
01:23:09,881 --> 01:23:13,048
Or what you expect someone
to pay you for your uterus.

1098
01:23:13,801 --> 01:23:17,502
Then take out your calculator
and multiply that number by 100.

1099
01:23:17,972 --> 01:23:20,890
Anything less than that
is a waste of our time.

1100
01:23:23,269 --> 01:23:26,472
We had that water brought
in special for you folks.

1101
01:23:26,689 --> 01:23:27,732
Came from Hinkley.

1102
01:23:44,999 --> 01:23:46,458
I think this meeting's over.

1103
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:48,537
Damn right it is.

1104
01:24:25,623 --> 01:24:29,835
What the fuck? Did a bomb blow up?
You letting the kids run wild?

1105
01:24:40,597 --> 01:24:41,639
What's that?

1106
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:53,809
I saw them in a mall one day.

1107
01:24:55,361 --> 01:24:56,939
I said, " Damn...

1108
01:24:57,614 --> 01:25:00,187
...they'll look good on
those beautiful ears."

1109
01:25:02,410 --> 01:25:07,238
I bought them and I said, "When Erin
does something nice, I'll surprise her."

1110
01:25:08,875 --> 01:25:10,914
You know how long ago that was?

1111
01:25:13,630 --> 01:25:14,672
Six months ago.

1112
01:25:17,258 --> 01:25:20,923
- I'm sorry, I've just...
- And so what I'm thinking <i>is...</i>

1113
01:25:24,849 --> 01:25:27,969
Either you gotta find
a different job or a different guy.

1114
01:25:30,396 --> 01:25:31,559
I <i>mean...</i>

1115
01:25:33,107 --> 01:25:36,773
There may be many men out there
who don't mind being the maid...

1116
01:25:36,986 --> 01:25:39,656
...and getting nothing.
But I ain't one of them.

1117
01:25:42,450 --> 01:25:44,028
I can't leave my job, George.

1118
01:25:44,285 --> 01:25:45,744
Yes, you can.

1119
01:25:46,663 --> 01:25:48,572
People do it all the time.

1120
01:25:49,666 --> 01:25:51,789
How can you ask me to do that?

1121
01:25:53,503 --> 01:25:55,330
This <i>job...</i>

1122
01:25:56,881 --> 01:26:01,045
For the first time in my
life, I got people respecting me.

1123
01:26:01,261 --> 01:26:02,719
Up in Hinkley...

1124
01:26:02,929 --> 01:26:07,258
...I walk into a room, everybody shuts
up to hear what I have to say.

1125
01:26:07,475 --> 01:26:10,559
I never had that before, ever.

1126
01:26:11,396 --> 01:26:13,388
Please, don't ask me to give it up.

1127
01:26:13,773 --> 01:26:15,398
What about your kids?

1128
01:26:16,442 --> 01:26:20,226
I'm doing more for them now
than I did living with my parents.

1129
01:26:20,446 --> 01:26:21,857
One day they'll see it.

1130
01:26:22,073 --> 01:26:24,742
- Well, what about me?
- What about you?

1131
01:26:29,038 --> 01:26:31,576
You think the men
who gave me those children...

1132
01:26:31,791 --> 01:26:34,958
...asked me what I
wanted before walking away?

1133
01:26:35,170 --> 01:26:38,585
All I've ever done
is bend my life around...

1134
01:26:38,798 --> 01:26:41,087
...what men decide they need.

1135
01:26:41,301 --> 01:26:44,337
Well, not now.
I'm sorry. I won't do it.

1136
01:26:44,554 --> 01:26:45,597
<i>Well...</i>

1137
01:26:46,598 --> 01:26:48,923
Erin, I'm not them. <i>So...</i>

1138
01:26:49,517 --> 01:26:51,889
What more can I do
to prove that to you?

1139
01:26:53,062 --> 01:26:54,343
Stay.

1140
01:27:10,497 --> 01:27:11,872
What for?

1141
01:27:14,584 --> 01:27:16,078
I mean, you got a raise.

1142
01:27:16,294 --> 01:27:18,583
You can afford daycare.
You don't need me.

1143
01:28:03,675 --> 01:28:04,837
Hi.

1144
01:28:20,900 --> 01:28:22,311
We can get them, Pamela.

1145
01:28:23,570 --> 01:28:24,850
We can.

1146
01:28:25,321 --> 01:28:28,192
I don't wanna feel it all over again...

1147
01:28:28,408 --> 01:28:31,113
...and then not have it come out right.

1148
01:28:32,829 --> 01:28:35,498
I don't know if I could handle that.

1149
01:28:36,416 --> 01:28:38,408
Put the kids through that.

1150
01:28:39,127 --> 01:28:43,077
The thing is, it doesn't matter
whether you win, lose or draw here.

1151
01:28:43,298 --> 01:28:48,423
You were lied to. You're sick and your
kids are sick because of those lies.

1152
01:28:51,181 --> 01:28:53,885
You all have to come together...

1153
01:28:54,100 --> 01:28:56,591
...to stand up in
a courtroom and say that.

1154
01:29:02,567 --> 01:29:04,773
I'd bring the kids
into the hospital...

1155
01:29:04,986 --> 01:29:08,818
...with towels soaked
from their nosebleeds.

1156
01:29:12,702 --> 01:29:17,411
They called County Services because
they assumed the kids were abused.

1157
01:29:22,295 --> 01:29:25,545
Am I gonna get the best
behaviour in the office?

1158
01:29:25,757 --> 01:29:26,955
No.

1159
01:29:27,175 --> 01:29:32,216
What's with the attitude?
I just need cool, I need quiet.

1160
01:29:32,639 --> 01:29:35,130
Hello. Am I alone in the car? Yes?

1161
01:29:35,350 --> 01:29:38,968
- I don't understand why...
- I don't wanna talk about it now.

1162
01:29:39,187 --> 01:29:41,678
- The other moms gave permission.
- I don't care.

1163
01:29:41,898 --> 01:29:46,359
- So when can I get a friggin' answer?
- Don't talk to me like that!

1164
01:29:46,569 --> 01:29:48,111
Randy's mom said yes.

1165
01:29:48,321 --> 01:29:51,986
Goddamn it, Randy's mom doesn't
work, and his dad didn't leave her!

1166
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:54,738
Figuring out who
takes him to roller hockey...

1167
01:29:54,953 --> 01:29:58,119
...is probably easier at
Randy's house. Now cool it.

1168
01:30:02,961 --> 01:30:06,412
I'll be as quick as I can.
Matthew, can you watch your sister?

1169
01:30:07,298 --> 01:30:10,252
- Matthew.
- All right, fine. Come here, Beth.

1170
01:30:10,468 --> 01:30:13,469
- Can I come with you?
- No, baby, I'll just be a second.

1171
01:30:49,674 --> 01:30:52,295
Thank you. I'm only
sorry you couldn't meet Erin.

1172
01:30:52,510 --> 01:30:53,625
- I will.
- You will.

1173
01:30:53,845 --> 01:30:56,336
We have a lot of work to do together.

1174
01:30:56,556 --> 01:30:59,426
Thanks for coming.
Erin, I was just talking about you.

1175
01:30:59,642 --> 01:31:02,846
Meet our new partner, Kurt Potter.
He'll handle Hinkley.

1176
01:31:03,062 --> 01:31:05,732
I see what you mean
about a secret weapon.

1177
01:31:05,940 --> 01:31:09,356
Erin, it's great to meet you.
You've done a fabulous job.

1178
01:31:09,569 --> 01:31:12,938
- I'll be seeing you.
- Thanks, I appreciate you coming over.

1179
01:31:25,335 --> 01:31:26,351
What?

1180
01:31:26,456 --> 01:31:27,920
Our new partner?

1181
01:31:28,129 --> 01:31:30,537
When was I gonna hear about this?

1182
01:31:30,757 --> 01:31:34,340
Just listen. Did I ever tell
you about that airline case?

1183
01:31:34,677 --> 01:31:36,670
What the fuck are you talking about?

1184
01:31:36,888 --> 01:31:39,640
A few years back, I was
trying this airline case...

1185
01:31:39,849 --> 01:31:44,310
...and I got my ass kicked by this
guy. He buried me in paper, brutal.

1186
01:31:44,521 --> 01:31:46,679
He's the toughest
I'd ever been up against.

1187
01:31:46,898 --> 01:31:47,977
Make a point!

1188
01:31:48,274 --> 01:31:50,183
It was Kurt Potter.

1189
01:31:50,985 --> 01:31:56,110
After the judge's decision, I asked
him to partner, he didn't hesitate.

1190
01:31:56,366 --> 01:32:00,446
He wouldn't hesitate now, we did
all the work. Where was he before?

1191
01:32:00,662 --> 01:32:03,497
Will you listen to me?
It doesn't matter.

1192
01:32:03,706 --> 01:32:06,197
You wanna win this?
He gave me this check.

1193
01:32:06,417 --> 01:32:08,706
It covers all our expenses to date...

1194
01:32:08,920 --> 01:32:12,253
...and he's got more toxic
tort experience than anyone.

1195
01:32:12,465 --> 01:32:13,794
This is good news!

1196
01:32:18,179 --> 01:32:19,804
I got Pamela Duncan.

1197
01:32:32,360 --> 01:32:34,685
I'll open, Mommy.

1198
01:32:34,904 --> 01:32:38,356
You wanna open the can for
Mommy? Well, here, I'll help you.

1199
01:32:39,117 --> 01:32:40,528
You turn it?

1200
01:32:42,370 --> 01:32:45,205
- Hi, George.
- Hi, George. Let's go see.

1201
01:33:11,691 --> 01:33:12,770
Erin Brockovich?

1202
01:33:13,484 --> 01:33:15,773
Package from Masry and Vititoe.

1203
01:33:26,998 --> 01:33:29,121
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1204
01:33:32,337 --> 01:33:34,128
- What's in here?
- Baby.

1205
01:33:34,339 --> 01:33:36,627
There's no baby in here.

1206
01:33:37,300 --> 01:33:38,960
- What is it?
- A dolly.

1207
01:33:39,177 --> 01:33:41,419
It's a dolly? It's...

1208
01:33:54,526 --> 01:33:55,688
Lookit.

1209
01:33:58,613 --> 01:34:00,356
"Lookit" is right.

1210
01:34:08,081 --> 01:34:09,575
Do you see that?

1211
01:34:13,962 --> 01:34:16,203
- I want that.
- I want that too.

1212
01:34:16,422 --> 01:34:18,082
It's our lucky day.

1213
01:34:18,299 --> 01:34:19,794
Matthew, Katie!

1214
01:34:30,728 --> 01:34:34,097
PG and E has requested that we
submit to binding arbitration.

1215
01:34:34,566 --> 01:34:35,846
What's that?

1216
01:34:37,944 --> 01:34:41,230
That's where we try the case
without a jury, before a judge.

1217
01:34:41,447 --> 01:34:42,728
It's called a test trial.

1218
01:34:43,032 --> 01:34:46,069
The judge's decision
is final. There's no appeal.

1219
01:34:47,203 --> 01:34:50,489
- How many plaintiffs do you have?
- 634.

1220
01:34:51,499 --> 01:34:53,824
They'll never try
that many all at once.

1221
01:34:54,043 --> 01:34:57,543
So we need to get them together
in groups of 20 or 30.

1222
01:34:57,755 --> 01:35:02,631
Worst cases, the most life-threatened,
the sickest first and so on.

1223
01:35:02,844 --> 01:35:06,213
Each one gets a go before
the judge to determine damages.

1224
01:35:06,598 --> 01:35:08,590
PG and E proposes that they're liable...

1225
01:35:08,808 --> 01:35:12,592
...anywhere between
50 and 400 million.

1226
01:35:14,105 --> 01:35:16,892
So wait a minute. Let
me just get this straight.

1227
01:35:17,192 --> 01:35:18,271
If we went to trial...

1228
01:35:18,484 --> 01:35:22,565
...PG and E could stretch this over
10 years with appeal after appeal.

1229
01:35:22,780 --> 01:35:25,651
- Those people would...
- These people expect a trial.

1230
01:35:26,367 --> 01:35:30,282
That's what we told them, you
and me. They won't understand this.

1231
01:35:32,582 --> 01:35:34,990
Kurt thinks it's the best way to go.

1232
01:35:44,427 --> 01:35:48,888
Look, I promise you that we'll
be very sensitive on this point.

1233
01:35:49,349 --> 01:35:51,009
We'll make sure they see...

1234
01:35:51,226 --> 01:35:55,093
...that this is the only way
we can go forward at this time.

1235
01:35:55,813 --> 01:35:57,890
But we have a lot of work to do...

1236
01:35:58,483 --> 01:36:01,353
...before we even broach that subject.

1237
01:36:03,029 --> 01:36:04,938
I'll take Erin down the hall...

1238
01:36:05,156 --> 01:36:09,699
...so we can start on this stuff,
and I'll fill her in on the details.

1239
01:36:10,411 --> 01:36:14,077
- Those are my files.
- Yeah. We had them couriered over.

1240
01:36:14,541 --> 01:36:16,664
Listen, good work.
They're a great start.

1241
01:36:16,876 --> 01:36:20,541
We'll just spend some time
filling in the holes in your research.

1242
01:36:20,755 --> 01:36:25,631
Excuse me... Theresa, is it?
There are no holes in my research.

1243
01:36:26,052 --> 01:36:29,468
There are things we need
you probably didn't know to ask.

1244
01:36:29,973 --> 01:36:31,965
Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot.

1245
01:36:32,183 --> 01:36:34,472
I spent 18 months on this case...

1246
01:36:34,727 --> 01:36:38,227
...and I know more about
the plaintiffs than you ever will.

1247
01:36:39,691 --> 01:36:41,814
You don't even have phone numbers.

1248
01:36:42,235 --> 01:36:43,480
Whose number do you need?

1249
01:36:43,695 --> 01:36:47,064
Everyone's. We need to be
able to contact the plaintiffs.

1250
01:36:47,532 --> 01:36:49,524
I said whose number do you need?

1251
01:36:50,952 --> 01:36:53,324
You don't know 600 numbers by heart.

1252
01:37:08,386 --> 01:37:09,584
Annabelle Daniels.

1253
01:37:09,804 --> 01:37:13,932
Annabelle Daniels. 714-454-9346.

1254
01:37:14,142 --> 01:37:17,226
Ten years old. Lived
on the plume since birth.

1255
01:37:17,437 --> 01:37:21,850
Wanted to be a synchronized swimmer,
so she spent every minute in the pool.

1256
01:37:22,150 --> 01:37:24,226
They detected a tumour in her brain.

1257
01:37:24,444 --> 01:37:27,361
An operation shrunk it,
with radiation after that.

1258
01:37:27,614 --> 01:37:29,238
Her parents are Ted and Rita.

1259
01:37:29,449 --> 01:37:34,526
Ted's got Crohn's disease. Rita has
headaches and underwent a hysterectomy.

1260
01:37:34,829 --> 01:37:38,779
Ted grew up in Hinkley. His
brother and his wife and their kids...

1261
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:43,080
...Robbie Jr., Martha, Ed, Rose
and Peter also lived on the plume.

1262
01:37:43,296 --> 01:37:45,454
Their number is 454-9554.

1263
01:37:45,715 --> 01:37:47,589
You want their diseases?

1264
01:37:53,014 --> 01:37:55,172
I think we got off on the wrong foot.

1265
01:37:55,391 --> 01:37:59,259
That's all you got, lady, two
wrong feet in fucking ugly shoes.

1266
01:38:05,610 --> 01:38:09,061
- She insulted me.
- Bullshit. It was a misunderstanding.

1267
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:12,317
Instead of being polite and
treating her with respect...

1268
01:38:12,534 --> 01:38:13,992
Why should I respect her?

1269
01:38:14,202 --> 01:38:18,947
Just because she's not supporting kids
with no husband, she's not an idiot!

1270
01:38:19,165 --> 01:38:21,372
Just because she
dresses like a lawyer...

1271
01:38:21,584 --> 01:38:25,084
...doesn't mean she didn't
work her ass off in law school.

1272
01:38:25,296 --> 01:38:27,419
Excuse me for not going to law school.

1273
01:38:27,632 --> 01:38:31,499
Law school? At this point,
I'd settle for charm school!

1274
01:38:39,894 --> 01:38:41,092
Mr. Linwood!

1275
01:38:49,445 --> 01:38:50,904
Bob?

1276
01:38:55,493 --> 01:38:59,242
6086 Ridge Road...

1277
01:39:00,123 --> 01:39:03,243
...Hinkley, California. 714...

1278
01:39:04,919 --> 01:39:06,579
<i>...455...</i>

1279
01:39:07,755 --> 01:39:10,959
<i>Okay, now, if you</i>
<i>could walk me through...</i>

1280
01:39:11,301 --> 01:39:16,342
...all of the elements
of Annabelle's illnesses.

1281
01:39:17,640 --> 01:39:19,300
Specific details...

1282
01:39:19,517 --> 01:39:24,393
...when the symptoms began,
prior to the first medical visit.

1283
01:39:25,607 --> 01:39:29,521
If you could reserve sentimental
embellishments, I'd appreciate it...

1284
01:39:29,736 --> 01:39:32,227
...because they won't
help you in court.

1285
01:39:32,447 --> 01:39:35,567
I just need facts, dates, time.

1286
01:39:36,743 --> 01:39:39,827
<i>I know Theresa isn't real</i>
<i>warm, but she's a good lawyer.</i>

1287
01:39:40,538 --> 01:39:44,322
<i>She asks the same questions</i>
<i>you did. I told you everything.</i>

1288
01:39:44,542 --> 01:39:49,038
<i>I don't want her coming to the</i>
<i>house again. She upsets Annabelle.</i>

1289
01:39:49,255 --> 01:39:52,007
Okay, if you don't like
Theresa, that's okay.

1290
01:39:52,217 --> 01:39:55,004
You know how important
Annabelle is to me.

1291
01:39:55,220 --> 01:39:57,212
Ed and I are still here for you.

1292
01:39:57,430 --> 01:40:01,475
I called Ed two days ago, Erin.
He still hasn't called me back.

1293
01:40:01,684 --> 01:40:03,843
Now, I hate to say this, but...

1294
01:40:04,103 --> 01:40:06,855
...everyone's upset
about this arbitration thing.

1295
01:40:07,732 --> 01:40:08,977
What?

1296
01:40:09,192 --> 01:40:11,434
<i>Pamela has written a letter...</i>

1297
01:40:11,653 --> 01:40:14,144
...telling everybody
to get new lawyers.

1298
01:40:14,364 --> 01:40:15,609
That we've been lied to.

1299
01:40:16,032 --> 01:40:18,701
<i>- Is it true?</i>
- No.

1300
01:40:19,202 --> 01:40:20,364
<i>Did you?</i>

1301
01:40:20,578 --> 01:40:24,742
I'm telling you the truth, and
I'll get to the bottom of all of this.

1302
01:40:24,958 --> 01:40:26,416
<i>Don't lie to us.</i>

1303
01:40:26,626 --> 01:40:28,120
I will take care of this.

1304
01:40:28,336 --> 01:40:31,372
<i>- Now, we're trusting you here, so...</i>
- Thanks.

1305
01:40:31,589 --> 01:40:33,629
I'll talk to you soon, okay?

1306
01:40:37,136 --> 01:40:39,378
I'm not saying
it's not a strong case.

1307
01:40:39,597 --> 01:40:43,809
Otherwise, they wouldn't have dropped
the demurrers. I wouldn't be here.

1308
01:40:44,018 --> 01:40:47,019
What I am saying is, we
don't have a smoking gun...

1309
01:40:47,230 --> 01:40:49,306
...that ties San Francisco to Hinkley.

1310
01:40:49,524 --> 01:40:52,774
Something that
proves that prior to 1987...

1311
01:40:52,986 --> 01:40:57,861
...PG and E Corporate knew the water was
bad there and did nothing about it.

1312
01:40:59,367 --> 01:41:03,946
- Erin, I thought you took a sick day.
- So did I.

1313
01:41:09,752 --> 01:41:12,872
- What's going on in there?
- Meeting about the PG and E thing.

1314
01:41:13,089 --> 01:41:15,212
- Are you sure?
- Yep.

1315
01:41:17,302 --> 01:41:20,421
We can find it, or
we don't have a big win.

1316
01:41:21,222 --> 01:41:24,057
Can I take a brief
break here for a moment?

1317
01:41:24,809 --> 01:41:26,138
I'll be right back.

1318
01:41:35,778 --> 01:41:39,278
- You told me you weren't feeling great.
- Bullshit!

1319
01:41:39,490 --> 01:41:44,402
If I was on my deathbed, if it
helped you, you'd drag me out of it!

1320
01:41:48,666 --> 01:41:50,199
How could you take this away from me?

1321
01:41:50,303 --> 01:41:54,243
- Nobody's taking anything.
- Bullshit! You stuck me in Siberia!

1322
01:41:54,506 --> 01:41:59,167
Dictating to some goddamned clerk
so you could finish this without me.

1323
01:41:59,385 --> 01:42:01,177
They screwed up, Erin!

1324
01:42:01,387 --> 01:42:03,713
They screwed up and they admit it.

1325
01:42:03,973 --> 01:42:05,717
The arbitration proposal...

1326
01:42:05,975 --> 01:42:09,724
...could've been written in Sanskrit,
for all the sense it made.

1327
01:42:09,938 --> 01:42:14,932
I know. I spoke to Ted. Pamela Duncan
wouldn't even get on the phone with me!

1328
01:42:15,151 --> 01:42:17,440
Pamela made everybody
mad with that letter.

1329
01:42:17,654 --> 01:42:19,112
She called us thieves.

1330
01:42:19,322 --> 01:42:21,362
- The whole thing's falling apart.
- Why?

1331
01:42:21,574 --> 01:42:25,442
Because before we go to arbitration,
the plaintiffs must agree!

1332
01:42:25,662 --> 01:42:28,912
- How many?
- Usually they require about 70%.

1333
01:42:29,123 --> 01:42:32,658
PG and E is demanding 90.
In other words, everybody.

1334
01:42:32,877 --> 01:42:34,953
Do you understand? This is serious.

1335
01:42:35,171 --> 01:42:37,579
And, what, Ed? I'm not serious?

1336
01:42:37,799 --> 01:42:39,838
You're emotional, you're erratic.

1337
01:42:40,051 --> 01:42:43,171
You say anything, you make
this personal, and it isn't.

1338
01:42:43,471 --> 01:42:44,965
Not personal?

1339
01:42:45,181 --> 01:42:46,723
That is my work!

1340
01:42:46,933 --> 01:42:49,139
My sweat! My time away from my kids!

1341
01:42:49,352 --> 01:42:52,388
If that's not personal,
I don't know what is.

1342
01:42:58,611 --> 01:43:00,271
Hey, come on.

1343
01:43:00,488 --> 01:43:01,769
Come on.

1344
01:43:02,866 --> 01:43:04,858
Go home. Get well.

1345
01:43:05,076 --> 01:43:07,614
Because you're no good to me sick.

1346
01:43:08,413 --> 01:43:10,322
I need you, all right?

1347
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:13,033
This case needs you.

1348
01:43:15,753 --> 01:43:17,627
Did you tell them that?

1349
01:43:43,156 --> 01:43:46,276
Binding arbitration isn't
that different from a trial.

1350
01:43:46,492 --> 01:43:50,870
It's overseen by a judge. Evidence
is presented in much the same way.

1351
01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:52,705
And then a jury decides?

1352
01:43:53,208 --> 01:43:58,119
Sorry, I forgot to mention that
there's no jury in binding arbitration.

1353
01:43:58,338 --> 01:44:00,129
No jury and no appeal.

1354
01:44:02,050 --> 01:44:04,885
What option do we have if
we don't like the result?

1355
01:44:05,094 --> 01:44:07,170
None. The judge's decision is final.

1356
01:44:07,388 --> 01:44:08,426
Not a good answer.

1357
01:44:08,530 --> 01:44:11,515
No, but we don't
anticipate that being a problem.

1358
01:44:11,726 --> 01:44:13,268
As I already told you...

1359
01:44:13,728 --> 01:44:17,393
...it's definitely between
50 and 400,000,000 dollars.

1360
01:44:17,732 --> 01:44:19,974
Well, which?
There's a big difference.

1361
01:44:20,193 --> 01:44:22,185
I wouldn't like to speculate.

1362
01:44:23,738 --> 01:44:27,487
- Well, how does it get divided?
- Yeah, who gets what?

1363
01:44:30,411 --> 01:44:35,038
My medical bills started two years ago,
before some of the other people here.

1364
01:44:35,250 --> 01:44:38,334
My daughter was in and out
of hospitals more than his.

1365
01:44:38,545 --> 01:44:41,249
It shouldn't matter when it started.

1366
01:44:42,590 --> 01:44:44,962
People, listen, please!

1367
01:44:45,176 --> 01:44:49,755
The point we have to address
tonight is getting everyone to agree...

1368
01:44:49,973 --> 01:44:53,009
...that binding arbitration
is better than a trial...

1369
01:44:53,226 --> 01:44:56,761
...that could go on for
10 years before you see any money.

1370
01:44:56,980 --> 01:45:00,265
Maybe some of us
wanna wait 10 years!

1371
01:45:04,070 --> 01:45:07,273
Everyone has to agree,
or no one has a chance!

1372
01:45:07,824 --> 01:45:12,818
Those of you about to leave, I'd like
you to keep this date in mind: 1978!

1373
01:45:13,037 --> 01:45:16,323
That's the year of
the Love Canal controversy.

1374
01:45:16,541 --> 01:45:18,866
They're still
waiting for their money!

1375
01:45:19,085 --> 01:45:22,371
Think about where
you'll be in 15 or 20 years.

1376
01:45:29,220 --> 01:45:32,554
Now, look, everyone.
Is this a big decision?

1377
01:45:32,849 --> 01:45:37,890
Absolutely! But I do not
believe this is a sell-out.

1378
01:45:38,229 --> 01:45:41,183
This is the best shot
to get everyone some money now.

1379
01:45:43,484 --> 01:45:45,810
You and I both know...

1380
01:45:46,529 --> 01:45:49,981
...there are people in this
room who can't afford to wait.

1381
01:45:51,284 --> 01:45:52,482
To take that chance.

1382
01:45:53,661 --> 01:45:55,488
Are you gonna make them wait?

1383
01:46:02,504 --> 01:46:04,461
So how many altogether?

1384
01:46:06,424 --> 01:46:11,216
We got just about everybody that came
here, but it leaves us about 150 short.

1385
01:46:11,429 --> 01:46:13,007
Oh, shit.

1386
01:46:14,974 --> 01:46:16,766
We'll have to go door-to-door.

1387
01:46:19,354 --> 01:46:21,477
I gotta go pick up my kids.

1388
01:46:25,735 --> 01:46:27,811
- You need a hand with that?
- No.

1389
01:46:34,244 --> 01:46:35,286
You did good.

1390
01:46:36,996 --> 01:46:38,455
We'll see.

1391
01:47:13,283 --> 01:47:14,741
Thanks for coming.

1392
01:47:19,831 --> 01:47:24,327
Don't take them anywhere on your
bike. I'll give you money for a cab.

1393
01:47:25,003 --> 01:47:26,201
I got money.

1394
01:47:26,921 --> 01:47:28,914
So how long is this gonna take?

1395
01:47:32,051 --> 01:47:33,711
I don't know. A few days.

1396
01:47:35,221 --> 01:47:36,846
Got your own room.

1397
01:47:49,569 --> 01:47:51,277
I am really sorry, George.

1398
01:47:53,698 --> 01:47:54,813
Have the kids eaten?

1399
01:47:58,578 --> 01:47:59,621
No.

1400
01:49:07,188 --> 01:49:10,142
Wanna get some pancakes?
Come on, let's go.

1401
01:49:10,358 --> 01:49:13,857
Everybody up today.

1402
01:49:14,070 --> 01:49:15,481
All right.

1403
01:49:15,822 --> 01:49:17,020
Come on, baby.

1404
01:49:17,240 --> 01:49:19,648
- What time is it?
- It's early.

1405
01:49:19,909 --> 01:49:22,579
We're taking your
car to go get breakfast.

1406
01:49:24,122 --> 01:49:27,573
- No, I need my car.
- We'll be back in a minute.

1407
01:49:28,793 --> 01:49:30,287
Get some sleep.

1408
01:49:31,129 --> 01:49:34,664
Matt, buddy.
Put that down. Let's go.

1409
01:49:34,883 --> 01:49:36,543
I'll be there in a minute.

1410
01:49:38,720 --> 01:49:42,385
Let's go get some
pancakes, girly. Come on.

1411
01:49:51,691 --> 01:49:52,854
Don't play with that.

1412
01:49:53,067 --> 01:49:57,279
It took me so long to get organized.
Would you put that back, please?

1413
01:49:57,488 --> 01:49:59,362
This girl's the same age as me.

1414
01:50:04,913 --> 01:50:06,111
Is she sick?

1415
01:50:10,084 --> 01:50:13,002
She is, but that's
why I'm helping her.

1416
01:50:13,213 --> 01:50:14,956
We'll make her feel better.

1417
01:50:15,632 --> 01:50:17,624
Why can't her own mama help her?

1418
01:50:20,845 --> 01:50:22,802
Because she's real sick too.

1419
01:50:36,694 --> 01:50:38,901
I'll bring you back some breakfast.

1420
01:50:39,989 --> 01:50:41,400
You want eggs?

1421
01:50:44,202 --> 01:50:45,779
Eggs would be great.

1422
01:50:54,712 --> 01:50:56,420
Eggs would be perfect.

1423
01:52:07,160 --> 01:52:10,161
- Hey, Matt.
- Hey, Erin. How are you?

1424
01:52:13,333 --> 01:52:15,621
- You been at this all day?
- Yeah.

1425
01:52:15,877 --> 01:52:18,284
- You want some coffee?
- I'd love some.

1426
01:52:18,505 --> 01:52:20,711
- I'll make a fresh pot.
- Thanks.

1427
01:52:47,575 --> 01:52:49,283
Don't I know you?

1428
01:52:49,577 --> 01:52:50,620
I don't think so.

1429
01:52:50,828 --> 01:52:53,664
Sure, you were at the barbecue
in Hinkley.

1430
01:52:53,915 --> 01:52:55,742
And at the town meeting.

1431
01:52:57,085 --> 01:52:58,876
I was watching you.

1432
01:53:00,547 --> 01:53:02,420
I had my eye on you.

1433
01:53:04,884 --> 01:53:06,165
Nice.

1434
01:53:06,427 --> 01:53:10,508
You were talking to everybody
and writing down a lot of stuff.

1435
01:53:10,765 --> 01:53:15,557
When I saw you, I said to myself,
"There's something about her.

1436
01:53:16,688 --> 01:53:18,976
I really like that girl."

1437
01:53:20,859 --> 01:53:23,729
- Matt, can I get that coffee to go?
- Sure thing.

1438
01:53:27,282 --> 01:53:29,737
I feel like I can talk to you too.

1439
01:53:31,077 --> 01:53:34,528
Like you're the type of person
I could say anything to.

1440
01:53:36,416 --> 01:53:37,661
- Here you go.
- Great.

1441
01:53:37,917 --> 01:53:38,960
What do I owe you?

1442
01:53:39,210 --> 01:53:41,915
- There's no charge.
- Thanks, Matt.

1443
01:53:42,172 --> 01:53:44,959
Well, nice talking to you.

1444
01:53:45,175 --> 01:53:49,671
Would it be important if, when I worked
at the plant, I destroyed documents?

1445
01:53:55,602 --> 01:53:57,060
Maybe.

1446
01:53:59,022 --> 01:54:00,302
What's your name?

1447
01:54:00,982 --> 01:54:02,690
Charles Embry.

1448
01:54:03,151 --> 01:54:04,978
Charles. Erin.

1449
01:54:05,278 --> 01:54:06,737
Nice to meet you.

1450
01:54:09,240 --> 01:54:13,452
Can you excuse me for a quick...
I'm just gonna run to <i>the...</i>

1451
01:54:28,009 --> 01:54:29,337
Oh, come on.

1452
01:54:31,346 --> 01:54:34,631
Oh, you fucking piece of crap
with no signal!

1453
01:54:34,891 --> 01:54:36,266
Fuck!

1454
01:54:54,035 --> 01:54:55,410
<i>Ed. Ed, oh, my God.</i>

1455
01:54:55,787 --> 01:54:59,120
This guy said he destroyed records.
He worked there.

1456
01:54:59,374 --> 01:55:00,411
Slow down.

1457
01:55:00,515 --> 01:55:03,287
<i>I'm trying to relax.</i>
<i>This Charles Embry...</i>

1458
01:55:03,545 --> 01:55:05,087
- Who?
<i>- Charles Embry.</i>

1459
01:55:05,338 --> 01:55:08,209
I thought he was trying to kill me
or pick me up...

1460
01:55:08,466 --> 01:55:11,918
<i>... but why would he use that,</i>
<i>say that? It's crazy.</i>

1461
01:55:14,597 --> 01:55:18,547
Shit. Go back and see if he'll
make a declaration.

1462
01:55:18,810 --> 01:55:19,853
A declaration.

1463
01:55:20,061 --> 01:55:22,267
<i>But be careful.</i>
<i>Don't scare him off.</i>

1464
01:55:22,856 --> 01:55:25,525
And stay calm. Stay calm.

1465
01:55:25,775 --> 01:55:28,895
If it weren't for you,
I'd be in Palm Springs now.

1466
01:55:29,153 --> 01:55:31,561
<i>You're good at talking people</i>
<i>into things.</i>

1467
01:55:31,823 --> 01:55:36,734
Don't pepper him with questions.
Don't do that. Just...

1468
01:55:36,953 --> 01:55:40,785
People wanna tell their story.
Just let him talk. Let him...

1469
01:55:41,040 --> 01:55:43,745
<i>... do all the talking. All right?</i>

1470
01:55:48,381 --> 01:55:50,089
Oh, sorry.

1471
01:55:54,554 --> 01:55:56,760
Would you like another beer, <i>or...</i>

1472
01:56:05,398 --> 01:56:07,391
My cousin passed away yesterday.

1473
01:56:10,737 --> 01:56:12,314
He had kidney tumours...

1474
01:56:12,572 --> 01:56:16,570
...no colon, his intestines
were eaten away.

1475
01:56:16,784 --> 01:56:18,658
Forty-one years old.

1476
01:56:20,121 --> 01:56:22,327
I remember seeing him
over at the plant.

1477
01:56:22,582 --> 01:56:25,785
He'd be cleaning
the cooling towers, <i>wearing...</i>

1478
01:56:26,044 --> 01:56:27,835
What do you call them?

1479
01:56:28,046 --> 01:56:30,916
- A mask?
- Yeah, doctors' masks.

1480
01:56:32,300 --> 01:56:35,336
And it'd be soaked in red
from the nosebleeds.

1481
01:56:48,900 --> 01:56:51,023
I was working in the compressor.

1482
01:56:51,277 --> 01:56:54,860
The supervisor calls me
up to the office and says:

1483
01:56:55,114 --> 01:56:56,858
"We'll give you a shredder...

1484
01:56:57,116 --> 01:57:00,782
...and send you to the warehouse
to shred the documents we stored."

1485
01:57:03,122 --> 01:57:04,665
He say why?

1486
01:57:05,667 --> 01:57:08,668
Nope. And I didn't ask.

1487
01:57:12,674 --> 01:57:15,165
Did you look at the stuff
you destroyed?

1488
01:57:15,426 --> 01:57:18,214
It was a lot of dull
vacation schedules and stuff.

1489
01:57:19,848 --> 01:57:23,632
Then there were memos about
the holding ponds, the water in them.

1490
01:57:23,893 --> 01:57:28,354
And readings from the test wells,
stuff like that.

1491
01:57:32,443 --> 01:57:34,769
You were told to destroy those?

1492
01:57:35,113 --> 01:57:36,192
That's right.

1493
01:57:38,700 --> 01:57:40,657
Course, as it turns out...

1494
01:57:40,910 --> 01:57:43,781
...I wasn't a very good employee.

1495
01:58:00,180 --> 01:58:01,887
- Good morning!
- Morning.

1496
01:58:02,515 --> 01:58:04,591
Ed. Erin, what's this?

1497
01:58:05,518 --> 01:58:07,926
- May I?
- Yep. Go ahead.

1498
01:58:08,146 --> 01:58:10,767
Well, you know what, Mr. Potter?

1499
01:58:11,024 --> 01:58:13,978
We completely forgot
your birthday this year.

1500
01:58:14,235 --> 01:58:17,936
Seeing as how you've been so good
to me, it's a terrible oversight.

1501
01:58:18,198 --> 01:58:22,242
So Ed and I have been putting together
a present for you.

1502
01:58:22,493 --> 01:58:24,451
Six-hundred and thirty-four.

1503
01:58:24,913 --> 01:58:26,490
They're signed, every one.

1504
01:58:27,415 --> 01:58:28,790
Holy shit.

1505
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,705
Now, don't go
getting jealous, Theresa.

1506
01:58:31,961 --> 01:58:33,539
We have something for you.

1507
01:58:34,088 --> 01:58:37,339
Internal PG and E documents,
all about the contamination.

1508
01:58:37,592 --> 01:58:39,300
The one I like best says...

1509
01:58:39,552 --> 01:58:43,336
...I'm paraphrasing here, but it says,
"The water's poisonous...

1510
01:58:43,598 --> 01:58:47,181
...but it's best if this wasn't
discussed with the neighbours."

1511
01:58:47,435 --> 01:58:49,891
It's to Hinkley
from PG and E headquarters.

1512
01:58:50,146 --> 01:58:52,933
Stamp received March 1966.

1513
01:58:57,320 --> 01:58:58,898
How did you do this?

1514
01:59:00,365 --> 01:59:03,650
Seeing as how I have no
brains or legal expertise...

1515
01:59:03,910 --> 01:59:05,819
...and Ed was losing all faith.

1516
01:59:06,079 --> 01:59:07,621
Completely. No faith.

1517
01:59:07,872 --> 01:59:12,665
I went out there and performed sexual
favours. 634 blowjobs in five days.

1518
01:59:19,425 --> 01:59:21,335
I'm really quite tired.

1519
01:59:22,053 --> 01:59:23,428
Oh, thank you.

1520
01:59:49,789 --> 01:59:51,829
Why did you want me to come?

1521
01:59:53,459 --> 01:59:56,164
I wanna show you
what you helped to do.

1522
02:00:23,781 --> 02:00:25,774
- How are you feeling today?
- Good.

1523
02:00:26,159 --> 02:00:28,780
- It's a good day.
- Oh, I'm glad.

1524
02:00:29,287 --> 02:00:30,995
Well, come on in.

1525
02:00:31,789 --> 02:00:34,411
What a nice surprise this is.

1526
02:00:37,003 --> 02:00:38,046
Donna.

1527
02:00:41,257 --> 02:00:46,252
I wanted to come out here
instead of calling...

1528
02:00:46,513 --> 02:00:49,549
...because the judge
came back with a number.

1529
02:00:56,397 --> 02:01:00,775
For the whole group, or for us?

1530
02:01:01,528 --> 02:01:02,903
Both.

1531
02:01:04,155 --> 02:01:08,734
He's gonna make them pay 333 million.

1532
02:01:12,705 --> 02:01:14,912
- <i>And...</i>
- Oh, my God.

1533
02:01:17,335 --> 02:01:20,834
He's gonna make them give
5 million of that to your family.

1534
02:01:22,799 --> 02:01:24,079
Five million dollars?

1535
02:01:24,384 --> 02:01:26,044
Five million dollars.

1536
02:01:29,639 --> 02:01:32,510
I don't even know
how much money that is.

1537
02:01:33,017 --> 02:01:37,560
Well, it's enough. It's enough
for whatever you could ever need...

1538
02:01:37,814 --> 02:01:42,939
...or what your girls need, or your
girls' girls. It'll be enough.

1539
02:01:43,194 --> 02:01:46,314
Oh, Erin. Oh, God.

1540
02:01:48,867 --> 02:01:51,488
Thank you so much.

1541
02:01:55,081 --> 02:01:56,492
It's okay.

1542
02:02:01,421 --> 02:02:03,912
I don't know what I'd have done
without you.

1543
02:02:05,091 --> 02:02:06,716
It's a good day.

1544
02:02:07,760 --> 02:02:10,251
This is too much.

1545
02:02:20,940 --> 02:02:24,641
Masry and Vititoe, can l...?
Shoot!

1546
02:02:28,281 --> 02:02:29,989
Delivery for Ed Masry.

1547
02:02:30,241 --> 02:02:32,815
Last office down the corridor,
on the right.

1548
02:02:33,077 --> 02:02:34,453
Thank you.

1549
02:02:34,704 --> 02:02:36,447
Masry and Vititoe...

1550
02:02:36,664 --> 02:02:37,707
Damn it!

1551
02:02:37,916 --> 02:02:41,332
Does anyone know anything
about these phones?

1552
02:02:45,965 --> 02:02:48,503
Everybody loves the desk...

1553
02:02:48,760 --> 02:02:51,333
...you picked out for me.
It's great.

1554
02:02:52,305 --> 02:02:55,923
Guess who's on the cover
of <i>Los Angeles Lawyer</i> magazine?

1555
02:02:56,184 --> 02:02:58,176
Talk to you later, baby. Bye.

1556
02:03:03,107 --> 02:03:04,685
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1557
02:03:19,666 --> 02:03:23,248
I'd rather walk her through this
in person, to show her...

1558
02:03:23,461 --> 02:03:26,213
...visual aids, documents and stuff.

1559
02:03:26,464 --> 02:03:29,714
Tell her I won't take up
too much of her time.

1560
02:03:33,763 --> 02:03:37,428
It's a little more complicated
than Hinkley, so let me do that.

1561
02:03:39,602 --> 02:03:41,844
Say I'm not a lawyer.
That may help.

1562
02:03:42,897 --> 02:03:43,940
Great.

1563
02:03:44,190 --> 02:03:47,642
Why don't you give me the address now?
Just in case.

1564
02:03:51,906 --> 02:03:55,358
All right. Thanks so much. Bye.

1565
02:03:55,660 --> 02:03:57,071
What's up?

1566
02:03:58,538 --> 02:04:00,495
I have your bonus check.

1567
02:04:04,335 --> 02:04:06,162
I want you to be prepared.

1568
02:04:08,590 --> 02:04:11,163
The figure's not exactly
what we discussed.

1569
02:04:15,054 --> 02:04:16,597
Why not?

1570
02:04:16,806 --> 02:04:20,674
Because, after careful consideration,
I felt...

1571
02:04:21,895 --> 02:04:25,098
...that figure was not appropriate.

1572
02:04:26,733 --> 02:04:28,524
Although you may not agree...

1573
02:04:29,444 --> 02:04:31,187
...you have to trust my...

1574
02:04:31,654 --> 02:04:34,192
Trust? You want me to trust you?

1575
02:04:34,449 --> 02:04:37,200
Don't use big words
you don't understand.

1576
02:04:37,660 --> 02:04:40,365
- It's a complicated issue...
- I did a job.

1577
02:04:40,622 --> 02:04:43,788
You should reward me accordingly.
It's not complicated.

1578
02:04:44,042 --> 02:04:48,538
All you lawyers do is complicate
situations that aren't complicated.

1579
02:04:48,922 --> 02:04:51,876
Do you know why people think
lawyers are scumbags?

1580
02:04:52,091 --> 02:04:55,626
Because they are. I can't believe
you're doing this to me...

1581
02:04:55,845 --> 02:04:58,052
...when I'm up to my ass
in Kettleman plaintiffs...

1582
02:04:58,264 --> 02:05:00,802
...which looks to be
double the amount of Hinkley.

1583
02:05:01,017 --> 02:05:05,346
You expect me to leave my kids
with strangers, knock on doors...

1584
02:05:05,563 --> 02:05:08,350
...get these people to trust you,
and you're screwing me!

1585
02:05:10,235 --> 02:05:12,904
I want you to know,
it's not about the number!

1586
02:05:13,154 --> 02:05:15,443
It is about the way
my work is valued.

1587
02:05:15,698 --> 02:05:18,368
No matter what I do, you're not...

1588
02:05:23,665 --> 02:05:25,456
As I was saying...

1589
02:05:26,251 --> 02:05:30,663
...I decided that the figure
you proposed...

1590
02:05:30,922 --> 02:05:33,378
...was inappropriate.

1591
02:05:33,591 --> 02:05:34,920
So I increased it.

1592
02:05:46,145 --> 02:05:49,680
Do they teach beauty queens
how to apologize?

1593
02:05:49,941 --> 02:05:52,776
Because you suck at it.

1594
02:11:08,718 --> 02:11:09,761
