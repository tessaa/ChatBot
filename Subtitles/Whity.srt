1
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,707
The pudding's not to their taste.

2
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:35,443
A lot of things are not to
their taste.

3
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:54,566
You don't understand me, I think.

4
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,628
I want them to like everything
we do for them.

5
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,290
They're waiting.

6
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,989
You shouldn't sing songs like that.

7
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:02,132
What songs?

8
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:04,162
Black songs.

9
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,285
Whity!

10
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,720
We should have him put to sleep.

11
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:08,757
There are so many ways today.

12
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:11,335
Inject once...

13
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:15,571
Just a prick of the needle.

14
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:18,373
He wouldn't feel a thing...

15
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:21,777
and he'd fall asleep...

16
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:23,045
forever.

17
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:51,603
Look.

18
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,846
He's fond of you, Kate.

19
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:11,690
Dead...

20
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,956
you'd be a sweet memory.

21
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:15,865
Alive...

22
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:20,700
you're just a nuisance, a useless creature.

23
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:27,705
He's a Nicholson.

24
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,655
Yes, you're right.

25
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:42,585
Forgive me.

26
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:47,163
You'll learn to get along with us.

27
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:14,223
I...

28
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,789
I beg your pardon, Massa.

29
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:40,809
I... thank you, Massa.

30
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:13,137
What's that nigger doing here?

31
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:21,069
Who is he?

32
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:25,314
He's the Nicholson's butler.

33
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,142
What does that mean?

34
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,052
He's the wealthiest
rancher round here.

35
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:31,036
That's enough.

36
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:35,941
Come on, boys.

37
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:38,814
Or are you yellow?

38
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:19,922
Play!

39
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,105
Throw him out!

40
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:37,300
Do not kiss me Señora

41
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,302
Someone might come.

42
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:57,320
Then Garcia won't be happy anymore.

43
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,013
No one can disturb us,

44
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,685
you foolish Mexican.

45
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,017
Only Davie...

46
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:36,284
and not even someone like you
need be afraid of him.

47
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:47,971
Now tell me...

48
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:52,742
What does my husband have?

49
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,844
Is it serious?

50
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,165
Soon he'll die.

51
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,751
Everything eaten up.

52
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,760
All rotten, Señora.

53
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:57,870
I love you.

54
00:17:58,143 --> 00:17:59,075
Oh, I love you!

55
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:01,673
Beat me, beat me!

56
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:04,479
Crazy!

57
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:05,540
Ben!

58
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:15,672
Whi... ty.

59
00:20:27,767 --> 00:20:28,631
Yes?

60
00:20:36,642 --> 00:20:40,100
You'd... like to be rich?

61
00:20:46,419 --> 00:20:48,284
That wouldn't befit me.

62
00:20:54,894 --> 00:20:57,454
Kill my father, hmm?

63
00:21:03,703 --> 00:21:04,692
Oh, yes.

64
00:21:06,806 --> 00:21:07,670
Yes, sir.

65
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,132
The doct0r says you're dying.

66
00:21:47,313 --> 00:21:49,372
Don't look at me like that, Ben.

67
00:21:51,818 --> 00:21:53,581
Is it my fault...

68
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,253
you're sick?

69
00:22:17,743 --> 00:22:20,211
We'll make the time
you've got left...

70
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,948
just great, won't we Ben?

71
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:27,012
You must think
of my future, Ben, hmm?

72
00:22:55,915 --> 00:22:58,110
One can get used
to so many things.

73
00:23:11,397 --> 00:23:13,661
Have you been working, Frank?

74
00:23:14,934 --> 00:23:17,232
I was riding out
over my father's land.

75
00:23:31,417 --> 00:23:35,148
Whity's made a number
of suggestions, Katherine.

76
00:23:52,438 --> 00:23:56,272
The blacks should be given
more rights.

77
00:23:57,243 --> 00:23:58,642
Then they wouldn't get up to...

78
00:23:59,445 --> 00:24:00,935
so much mischief.

79
00:24:02,448 --> 00:24:04,541
I...
- Yes?

80
00:24:06,586 --> 00:24:08,520
I think so, too.

81
00:24:09,121 --> 00:24:11,316
We need the blacks to do the work.

82
00:24:13,426 --> 00:24:16,293
And if there were trouble...

83
00:24:17,129 --> 00:24:18,460
it wouldn't be good...

84
00:24:18,631 --> 00:24:20,496
for the work, I mean, would it?

85
00:24:31,277 --> 00:24:34,769
I've acquainted myself...

86
00:24:35,548 --> 00:24:37,743
with ideas like that, too.

87
00:24:38,584 --> 00:24:39,448
It might be...

88
00:24:39,719 --> 00:24:43,553
useful later, Pa.
- Close the door.

89
00:25:23,663 --> 00:25:26,359
I shall implement
some of these ideas.

90
00:25:30,002 --> 00:25:31,560
Of course, Pa.

91
00:26:42,608 --> 00:26:43,597
Come here.

92
00:30:33,906 --> 00:30:35,237
To hell with you, baby!

93
00:31:20,352 --> 00:31:21,512
Who was that?

94
00:31:23,188 --> 00:31:24,917
A customer, darling.

95
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:15,033
Anything wrong?

96
00:32:15,607 --> 00:32:17,336
No... Why?

97
00:32:18,477 --> 00:32:19,967
Just a fee ing I had.

98
00:32:50,642 --> 00:32:52,303
Let's go East...
the two of us.

99
00:33:38,991 --> 00:33:40,253
Why not?

100
00:33:54,706 --> 00:33:56,230
I'm content here.

101
00:36:15,847 --> 00:36:17,712
Davie spied on us last night.

102
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:21,449
Ben couldn't get it up.

103
00:36:23,188 --> 00:36:25,053
That's why he's so mad.

104
00:36:29,127 --> 00:36:31,061
Whip me instead of him, Massa.

105
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,744
OK. Strip off!

106
00:37:53,278 --> 00:37:54,870
Yell, Whity! Yell!

107
00:37:59,451 --> 00:38:01,749
It's better you do what I want.

108
00:38:04,556 --> 00:38:06,114
He's taking a beating for Davie.

109
00:38:07,292 --> 00:38:08,156
Crazy!

110
00:38:17,602 --> 00:38:19,934
That was pretty good, Whity.

111
00:38:31,583 --> 00:38:32,914
Yes, that's it.

112
00:38:33,151 --> 00:38:34,948
Here you are.

113
00:38:35,654 --> 00:38:36,848
Bye.

114
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:53,796
Has my telegram arrived?

115
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,280
Would you mind?
- Are you in a hurry?

116
00:39:04,549 --> 00:39:05,345
Yes.

117
00:39:06,618 --> 00:39:10,213
You're in luck. It's arrived.

118
00:39:19,831 --> 00:39:21,389
Here.

119
00:39:31,543 --> 00:39:33,238
She believe it immediately.

120
00:39:33,712 --> 00:39:35,236
Her eyes light up.

121
00:39:35,714 --> 00:39:39,912
Then she pull me onto bed
and scream I should beat her.

122
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:45,849
Now I get the money.
I play your doctor well?

123
00:39:47,025 --> 00:39:48,151
Oh yes.

124
00:40:33,705 --> 00:40:34,569
And then?

125
00:40:37,442 --> 00:40:39,501
Then he boasted that he had...

126
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:47,714
raped my wife.

127
00:41:06,671 --> 00:41:07,968
Is this your husband?

128
00:42:08,633 --> 00:42:09,827
Assassin!

129
00:42:28,286 --> 00:42:30,151
Mr. Nicholson's telling the truth.

130
00:42:31,256 --> 00:42:33,121
I... heard it all.

131
00:43:09,194 --> 00:43:10,718
It'll soon heal.

132
00:43:15,533 --> 00:43:17,967
Ben Nicholson's a very sick man.

133
00:43:18,203 --> 00:43:20,603
He hasn't much longer to live.

134
00:43:22,774 --> 00:43:26,437
Then there'll be no one in charge
of the Nicholson estate.

135
00:43:28,279 --> 00:43:31,544
Or do you think Frank,
or even Dave would be capable?

136
00:43:47,432 --> 00:43:48,364
I reckon...

137
00:43:51,169 --> 00:43:54,263
the two of us...

138
00:44:02,247 --> 00:44:03,236
would be able to...

139
00:44:14,125 --> 00:44:14,989
We're tough.

140
00:44:17,395 --> 00:44:19,260
You must get rid of Frank.

141
00:44:36,948 --> 00:44:39,883
Nigger's whore!

142
00:44:47,158 --> 00:44:50,025
My mother is a whore.

143
00:44:50,228 --> 00:44:51,092
It's crazy!

144
00:47:18,676 --> 00:47:20,701
He's going to her now.

145
00:47:40,565 --> 00:47:42,430
I knew you'd come.

146
00:48:01,352 --> 00:48:02,614
You called, madam?

147
00:48:03,788 --> 00:48:05,847
Bring me a glass of water.

148
00:48:07,792 --> 00:48:09,123
With ice.

149
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:10,324
Yes, madam.

150
00:49:20,865 --> 00:49:21,729
You called?

151
00:49:23,868 --> 00:49:25,335
Give me a candy, Whity.

152
00:49:27,438 --> 00:49:28,405
And quick about it.

153
00:49:37,181 --> 00:49:38,239
Thank you, Whity.

154
00:49:40,651 --> 00:49:42,346
I don't want one after all.

155
00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:47,122
Very well, madam.

156
00:50:14,185 --> 00:50:15,413
You called?

157
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:18,011
I'd like a candy too, Whity.

158
00:50:39,877 --> 00:50:40,809
Thanks, Whity.

159
00:50:53,858 --> 00:50:56,383
I love you, I love you.

160
00:51:06,037 --> 00:51:07,561
Oh, I'm sorry.

161
00:51:07,872 --> 00:51:09,396
I knocked the bell over.

162
00:51:38,069 --> 00:51:39,934
I don't understand you.

163
00:51:46,444 --> 00:51:47,968
You don't want to be free.

164
00:51:54,452 --> 00:51:56,818
You like it when they beat you.

165
00:52:04,929 --> 00:52:05,953
You swine.

166
00:52:13,938 --> 00:52:14,962
Servile...

167
00:52:15,773 --> 00:52:17,468
and dependent.

168
00:52:30,955 --> 00:52:32,650
You don't deserve any better.

169
00:52:39,797 --> 00:52:41,662
Come and lie down with me.

170
00:52:54,979 --> 00:52:56,844
I can pay if you like.

171
00:54:08,085 --> 00:54:09,279
Get dressed and get out.

172
00:56:13,577 --> 00:56:14,671
Whity,

173
00:56:24,021 --> 00:56:25,215
do I appeal to you?

174
00:56:32,396 --> 00:56:33,761
Come here, my boy.

175
00:56:35,566 --> 00:56:36,931
Comb my hair.

176
00:56:48,746 --> 00:56:50,941
But you mustn't hurt me.

177
00:57:06,931 --> 00:57:08,296
Don't I have soft hands?

178
00:57:12,937 --> 00:57:15,303
Why haven't you killed my father?

179
00:57:21,946 --> 00:57:23,641
Stay where you are,
you damned nigger!

180
00:58:04,822 --> 00:58:05,846
Stop that.

181
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:51,065
You must be crazy.

182
00:58:52,236 --> 00:58:54,261
Letting a Nicholson peel potatoes.

183
00:58:55,039 --> 00:58:55,903
He likes doing it.

184
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:00,934
Don't forget...

185
00:59:01,578 --> 00:59:03,603
you're a Nicholson, too.

186
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:11,585
I'm a nigger.

187
01:00:03,607 --> 01:00:04,801
You called?

188
01:00:12,149 --> 01:00:13,343
Frank was just here.

189
01:00:16,453 --> 01:00:18,148
You insulted him.

190
01:00:20,457 --> 01:00:22,152
Since when may a black...

191
01:00:22,626 --> 01:00:24,321
insult a white man?

192
01:00:31,468 --> 01:00:33,333
You're the curse of this family.

193
01:00:38,175 --> 01:00:40,200
You know you have to be punished.

194
01:00:40,644 --> 01:00:42,009
Yes, I deserve it.

195
01:00:49,186 --> 01:00:50,380
My God, he's crying.

196
01:00:51,655 --> 01:00:53,350
He's really crying.

197
01:00:54,658 --> 01:00:56,353
A human emotion.

198
01:00:58,495 --> 01:01:02,022
And I always thought
you blacks weren't human beings.

199
01:01:02,499 --> 01:01:04,364
You're right.
We're not human beings.

200
01:01:12,676 --> 01:01:14,701
Why haven't you killed Frank?

201
01:01:18,215 --> 01:01:20,080
I implored you to.

202
01:01:20,851 --> 01:01:22,045
Didn't I implore you?

203
01:01:24,521 --> 01:01:27,547
We wanted to share the property.

204
01:01:29,193 --> 01:01:30,558
Just think it over.

205
01:01:32,529 --> 01:01:36,056
Who else would give
the likes of you...

206
01:01:38,035 --> 01:01:39,400
a chance like that?

207
01:01:40,871 --> 01:01:42,395
I can't do it, m'lady.

208
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:44,432
She'll be down at once, mister.

209
01:02:32,656 --> 01:02:34,624
Hello, Ben.
- Hello, Dave.

210
01:02:35,926 --> 01:02:37,791
Can I bring you a sherry?

211
01:02:38,028 --> 01:02:39,120
That'd be nice.

212
01:02:44,301 --> 01:02:45,495
Take a seat!
- Thanks.

213
01:02:49,773 --> 01:02:52,640
How are things
with your young wife?

214
01:02:53,777 --> 01:02:55,472
Everything still OK?

215
01:03:01,652 --> 01:03:05,349
I... I'm getting a divorce soon.

216
01:03:05,789 --> 01:03:06,756
NO...

217
01:03:08,625 --> 01:03:10,320
I knew it.

218
01:03:10,627 --> 01:03:11,651
That woman's a she-devil.

219
01:03:49,199 --> 01:03:50,393
You can go now.

220
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:09,743
Tell me all about it.

221
01:04:14,691 --> 01:04:15,715
Katherine...

222
01:04:17,694 --> 01:04:20,720
believes I'm about to die.

223
01:04:23,367 --> 01:04:26,063
She's just waiting
to inherit the estate.

224
01:04:27,871 --> 01:04:30,567
We'll keep her in suspense
a bit longer.

225
01:04:31,708 --> 01:04:33,073
Then wham.

226
01:04:33,577 --> 01:04:36,273
She'll be out on her ear.

227
01:04:38,749 --> 01:04:41,775
No one cheats a Nicholson
and gets away with it.

228
01:04:45,722 --> 01:04:47,747
You want to keep her in suspense?

229
01:04:48,392 --> 01:04:51,156
No. That's marvelous.

230
01:04:52,396 --> 01:04:54,421
It's fantastic.

231
01:09:55,699 --> 01:09:58,395
Mr. Nicholson wishes
to address us in the hall.

232
01:09:58,868 --> 01:09:59,892
Please come down, m'lady.

233
01:10:00,537 --> 01:10:01,631
Thank you, Whity.

234
01:10:27,731 --> 01:10:30,427
Mr. Nicholson wishes
to address us in the hall.

235
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:32,595
Please come down.

236
01:10:33,737 --> 01:10:34,931
Do you know...

237
01:10:35,405 --> 01:10:36,770
what t's all about?

238
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:38,464
No, sir.

239
01:10:45,281 --> 01:10:46,305
Thanks, Whity.

240
01:10:58,128 --> 01:10:59,459
Is it something important?

241
01:10:59,763 --> 01:11:01,628
Please wait...

242
01:11:01,998 --> 01:11:03,625
till everyone's here.

243
01:11:28,458 --> 01:11:29,482
Well, then...

244
01:11:33,163 --> 01:11:35,688
My physicians have informed me...

245
01:11:38,301 --> 01:11:41,327
that I don't have long to live.

246
01:12:25,715 --> 01:12:28,582
The entire Nicholson estate
will pass,

247
01:12:30,353 --> 01:12:32,218
on my decease,

248
01:12:34,190 --> 01:12:35,714
in equal parts...

249
01:12:36,192 --> 01:12:38,888
to Katherine Nicholson,
née Stanwyck,

250
01:12:39,362 --> 01:12:40,886
and Frank Nicholson.

251
01:12:41,531 --> 01:12:44,557
Whereby it should be noted that...

252
01:12:45,034 --> 01:12:47,400
a part Of Katherine's rights,

253
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:49,736
yet to be determined,

254
01:12:50,406 --> 01:12:52,271
shall pass to Frank Nicholson...

255
01:12:53,042 --> 01:12:55,237
as soon as he...

256
01:12:57,247 --> 01:13:00,273
enters into wedlock.

257
01:13:02,051 --> 01:13:06,249
In the event of Katherine remarrying,

258
01:13:08,224 --> 01:13:12,923
she shall forfeit her entire share
of the Nicholson estate,

259
01:13:13,396 --> 01:13:16,923
which shall pass to Frank Nicholson.

260
01:13:21,070 --> 01:13:22,094
In return for which,

261
01:13:22,572 --> 01:13:28,272
she will receive
a cash payment of $50,000.

262
01:13:32,448 --> 01:13:39,479
The validity of this last will and
testament shall be dependent...

263
01:13:39,923 --> 01:13:42,790
on the following provisions:

264
01:13:53,303 --> 01:13:58,502
David Nicholson shall,
until the end of his days,

265
01:13:59,475 --> 01:14:04,503
be fed and cared for in this house.

266
01:14:06,783 --> 01:14:07,977
Furthermore,

267
01:14:09,452 --> 01:14:11,317
Samuel King,

268
01:14:12,922 --> 01:14:14,287
known as Whity,

269
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:19,827
and his mother, Marpessa,

270
01:14:20,964 --> 01:14:22,329
shall receive in this house...

271
01:14:23,466 --> 01:14:24,660
sustenance,

272

employment...

273
01:14:29,472 --> 01:14:32,839
and good treatment...

274
01:14:34,978 --> 01:14:36,343
for the rest of their lives.

275
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:44,018
This will was drawn up
on April 29, 1878.

276
01:14:44,954 --> 01:14:52,326
Signed: Ben... Nathaniel...
Richard... Nicholson.

277
01:15:02,005 --> 01:15:04,030
I'm eaving for Chicago tomorrow.

278
01:15:09,212 --> 01:15:10,406
I've got a job as a singer.

279
01:15:13,549 --> 01:15:15,073
The pay's good.

280
01:15:19,522 --> 01:15:21,888
It'd be enough for the two of us...

281
01:15:26,529 --> 01:15:27,894
at least at the beginning.

282
01:15:37,874 --> 01:15:39,398
I'm staying with my family.

283
01:15:47,050 --> 01:15:48,074
I'm fond of them.

284
01:15:52,555 --> 01:15:53,579
All of them.

285
01:15:54,390 --> 01:15:56,585
You've no idea
what that family's really like!

286
01:15:59,562 --> 01:16:02,429
You realize why your father
killed that Mexican?

287
01:16:03,566 --> 01:16:05,090
Because he pestered Katherine.

288
01:16:06,569 --> 01:16:07,433
Oh no.

289
01:16:12,442 --> 01:16:15,309
He had to pretend to be a doctor...

290
01:16:16,446 --> 01:16:19,472
and kid Katherine
that Ben was about to die.

291
01:16:22,285 --> 01:16:25,152
<i>Once his job was done,
Ben shot him down...</i>

292
01:16:25,755 --> 01:16:27,450
like a rabid dog.

293
01:16:35,431 --> 01:16:37,126
You and your family!

294
01:16:42,438 --> 01:16:43,632
He gave me money.

295
01:16:45,775 --> 01:16:46,969
A handsome sum.

296
01:16:51,147 --> 01:16:52,011
Here.

297
01:16:56,452 --> 01:16:57,646
To hell with it.

298
01:17:14,470 --> 01:17:16,165
Kill them! Do them all in!

299
01:17:21,177 --> 01:17:22,371
Free yourself of them.

300
01:17:26,182 --> 01:17:27,774
You're a human being, t0o.

301
01:17:32,655 --> 01:17:34,020
I must go down now.

302
01:18:54,270 --> 01:18:55,464
A bottle of whiskey.

303
01:19:55,064 --> 01:19:56,656
Can I join you in a game?

304
01:19:57,633 --> 01:20:00,329
If you've got the money.
- Sure.

305
01:20:21,157 --> 01:20:22,681
Two for me.
- One.

306
01:22:55,878 --> 01:22:57,505
My God, how funny you are!

307
01:23:11,727 --> 01:23:12,694
Why are you laughing?

308
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:07,280
She laughed at me, Pa.

309
01:26:19,748 --> 01:26:21,215
You're the only one of my sons...

310
01:26:21,717 --> 01:26:23,412
who has something from me.

311
01:26:23,986 --> 01:26:25,180
Frank's sick.

312
01:26:26,789 --> 01:26:28,051
David's sick.

313
01:26:29,992 --> 01:26:31,516
Katherine's a hyena.

314
01:26:32,695 --> 01:26:35,391
I command you to kill them all.

315
01:26:36,031 --> 01:26:38,124
You will inherit the estate.

316
01:27:39,828 --> 01:27:40,692
Oh, no!

317
01:27:43,832 --> 01:27:44,799
Please don't shoot!

318
01:27:46,135 --> 01:27:48,069
You can have the whole estate.

319
01:27:49,204 --> 01:27:50,228
Just let me...

320
01:27:51,774 --> 01:27:55,141
Let me live!... I beg you.

321
01:32:26,882 --> 01:32:29,407
You realize we'll die of thirst now?
