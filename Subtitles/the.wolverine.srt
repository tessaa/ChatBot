1
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:51,442
Where are you going?

2
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,276
Help me!

3
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:54,944
Over here!

4
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:28,909
Go!

5
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,304
Go!

6
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:34,511
That was a B-29, bub.
There's no outrunning what's coming.

7
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:36,553
Yashida!

8
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,152
You're better off down here.

9
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,697
I'd hurry if I were you.

10
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:54,956
Run. Now!

11
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:07,937
Stay down!

12
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,755
No, wait! No, no. Wait.

13
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,259
No. It's not safe.

14
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:08,096
Wake up, wake up, wake up.
Wake up.

15
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,275
Where were you?

16
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:15,309
Nagasaki.

17
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,644
That far back?

18
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:27,618
You're here.

19
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:28,886
Of course.

20
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,825
Can you stay?

21
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:33,588
You know I can't.

22
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:36,758
Jean, I'm so sorry.

23
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,159
I know.

24
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:41,967
I'll never hurt you or anyone
ever again.

25
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:43,438
I made a vow.

26
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:46,006
A solemn vow?

27
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,337
You're making fun of me.

28
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:52,444
It's too late.

29
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,582
No! No, Jean!

30
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,159
No, no, no! Please!

31
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:03,421
You can't hide.

32
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:04,585
No, no, no! Please!

33
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:05,924
You can't hide!

34
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:07,623
No, Jean! No!

35
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:09,323
No.

36
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:09,417
Whack all of that on store credit.
Thanks, honey.

37
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:15,458
- Got the arrows?
- Yeah.

38
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,121
Remember the arrows?

39
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:20,094
Yeah, yeah, Eddie, we got them!

40
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:26,560
Yeah!

41
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,470
What are you doing?

42
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:34,169
Man, you almost blew his foot off!

43
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,275
You're not a hunter, are you?

44
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,906
Not anymore.

45
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:39,311
What the hell?

46
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:58,755
Don't make me do this.

47
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,905
It must have been
damn near 12 feet tall.

48
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:48,513
We didn't hear nothing except twigs.

49
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:50,279
Then it just came upon us.

50
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:55,448
It got Riley, just gutted him.
It got Eddie.

51
00:10:56,322 --> 00:11:00,088
Ripped through the tent,
knocked over the snowcat like it was a toy.

52
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,985
You the one was attacked by the grizzly?

53
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:07,826
I'm the one that survived.

54
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:17,636
I'd like to buy this man a drink.

55
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,438
What's your name, mister?

56
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,151
It's Logan.

57
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:38,521
And that's a poison broadhead,
which, last I heard, was illegal.

58
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,673
Go ahead, ask me where I found it.

59
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,616
Ask me.

60
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:05,384
Where did you find it?

61
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,526
Well, funny you should ask.

62
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:09,854
I pulled it out of
the back of a grizzly.

63
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:15,023
Whoever shot it, didn't have the wind or
the balls to track the animal properly...

64
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:17,066
and put it out of its misery.

65
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:22,570
Instead of dropping
a lethal dose of the poison...

66
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:26,644
it bled into the bear,
made him crazy, killed five people.

67
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:28,473
I don't know what you're talking about.

68
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:30,342
Because I don't dip my arrows
in anything.

69
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:33,583
In that case,
you got nothing to worry about.

70
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:40,647
Damn.

71
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,327
That hurt.

72
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:52,226
Sorry, Jean.

73
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,704
I wouldn't bother with them.

74
00:12:56,876 --> 00:13:00,004
Most of them will die soon anyway,
without your help.

75
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:04,049
Three of them, a week from now
in the same truck.

76
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:24,694
This sword is hundreds of years old...

77
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:28,237
<i>and was named Danzan
by the first samurai who used it.</i>

78
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:31,240
<i>Danzan means "separator" in Japanese.</i>

79
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:37,480
The ideal weapon for separating
head and limb from body.

80
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,253
Like so.

81
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:54,626
I'm parked in back.

82
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:04,776
Get in.

83
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:18,785
Sorry, it's a rental.

84
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,691
Who are you?

85
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,524
Me? I'm Yukio.

86
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,131
And?

87
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,827
I've been trying to find you
for over a year.

88
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:31,562
Why?

89
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:33,705
To give you that.

90
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:36,169
My employer wanted you to have it.

91
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:39,174
Who's your employer?

92
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,404
Master Yashida.

93
00:14:55,694 --> 00:15:00,495
He said it belongs to you,
and that he's paying all debts.

94
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,157
Master Yashida is dying.

95
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:07,164
He wants to say thank you
for saving his life all those years ago.

96
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,769
He knows that you are a...

97
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:12,002
busy man.

98
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:15,669
But he very much wants to
say his goodbye in person.

99
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,742
All right, where is he?

100
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,179
Tokyo.

101
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:21,444
Wait...
I'm not going to Japan.

102
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,111
It would be dishonorable
for you to refuse his request.

103
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:28,351
Apologize to Mr. Yashida,
I'm not going to Tokyo.

104
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:30,051
All right? I've got things to do.

105
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:31,590
Do not apologize.

106
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,255
It's been an honor
just to meet the Wolverine.

107
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:39,803
That's not who I am anymore,
you understand?

108
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:42,799
Interesting.

109
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,734
Why did you go into that bar,
if not to seek justice?

110
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:47,901
- I don't know.
- You don't know.

111
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:49,309
- No!
- I think you know.

112
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:50,209
Pull over.

113
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:51,474
You are a soldier.

114
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:52,878
No, I'm not. Pull over.

115
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:55,885
- You are a soldier.
- Pull over, now!

116
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:57,383
Now.

117
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:05,821
You are a soldier,
and you seek what all soldiers do.

118
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:07,122
And what's that?

119
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,801
An honorable death.

120
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,197
An end to your pain.

121
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:14,468
Who says I'm in pain?

122
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:19,804
A man who has nightmares
every night of his life is in pain.

123
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:38,723
One day.

124
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:42,898
I say goodbye to Mr. Yashida
and I come right back.

125
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:45,730
Okay.

126
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:54,671
Fifteen hours. Depending on the wind.

127
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:56,904
Fifteen hours?

128
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,412
You don't like to fly?

129
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:01,475
I love it.

130
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,066
We are almost there.

131
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,003
So, you can see the future?

132
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:31,015
I can read a map.

133
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,743
You said you knew the future
of those assholes in the bar.

134
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:37,582
I know they are going to die.

135
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:40,617
We are all going to die.

136
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:44,260
You said they would die in the same truck,
in a week.

137
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:46,956
If you're right, that's quite a talent.

138
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,302
We don't all have claws.

139
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:58,301
So, do I die on this plane?

140
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:00,972
No.

141
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:03,411
Not on this plane.

142
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:37,781
Master Yashida is not well tonight.

143
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:55,294
A lot of guns.

144
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,957
There have been attacks.

145
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,866
Attempted kidnappings.
Attempted assassinations.

146
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:01,369
By who?

147
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,065
The Japanese mob, the Yakuza.

148
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:07,337
They've grown strong
as the government has grown weak.

149
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,173
Hip replacement.

150
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:40,437
Hey.

151
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,838
This way.

152
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,282
Who's that?

153
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:51,353
Shingen, Master Yashida's son.

154
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:55,982
He's good.

155
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,490
He's all right.

156
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:07,166
So, what happened
to the badass in boots?

157
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:09,500
Master Yashida is traditional.

158
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:12,644
One eye on the past
and the other on the future.

159
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:30,658
That's Mariko, his granddaughter.

160
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:51,043
Mariko.

161
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:54,018
What's wrong with you?

162
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:05,728
You haven't answered my emails.

163
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:08,021
I can't tell you now.

164
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:10,725
Yes, you can.

165
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,205
Who is the caveman?

166
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:20,470
The man Grandfather wanted me to find.

167
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,841
You can't bring him in like that.

168
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:36,527
Shizu and Saki
are going to disinfect you.

169
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,419
Give you a shave.

170
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:41,088
Like hell they are.

171
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,090
Get in the tub.

172
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:44,726
Whoa.

173
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:46,996
Get in the tub.

174
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:49,067
Really?

175
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:54,075
All right.

176
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,517
Okay. Okay.

177
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:03,322
All right, all right, all right.
I can do that bit.

178
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:15,193
What?

179
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:18,463
What?

180
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:20,637
You look nice.

181
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:23,274
I feel violated.

182
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:27,075
Prepare two more suppressors
for Master Yashida.

183
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:29,141
And check his blood pressure.

184
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:47,391
<i>Yashida-sama.</i>

185
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:56,965
<i>Kuzuri.</i>

186
00:22:57,476 --> 00:22:59,410
You look the same.

187
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:01,906
But, then, that is no surprise.

188
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:06,709
Dr. Green.

189
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,377
Leave us, please.

190
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:11,919
Five minutes, no more.

191
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:16,893
My oncologist.

192
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:18,720
Well done.

193
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:41,919
The painting is from the village
of my birth.

194
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:46,653
It depicts the bravery and skill
of the Black Clan.

195
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:49,260
Ninja warriors.

196
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:52,488
They served my family
for seven centuries.

197
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:57,828
I didn't send for you
only to thank you, Logan.

198
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,469
I wanted to repay you.

199
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:07,177
To offer you something no one else can.

200
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:11,446
A gift to equal the life you gave to me.

201
00:24:11,883 --> 00:24:13,350
I don't need anything.

202
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:14,951
Not a thing.

203
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:18,349
Eternity can be a curse.

204
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:22,222
It hasn't been easy for you,
living without time.

205
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:25,152
The losses you have had to suffer.

206
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:28,565
A man can run out of things to live for.

207
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:30,959
Lose his purpose.

208
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,865
Become a ronin.

209
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:37,366
A samurai without a master.

210
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,514
I can end your eternity.

211
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,578
Make you mortal.

212
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:54,552
What they did to me,
what I am, can't be undone.

213
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:57,695
Yashida Industries can do anything.

214
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:02,858
We have reason to believe
your ability to heal can be passed.

215
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:04,023
Passed?

216
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:05,726
From you to another.

217
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:12,335
You have struggled long enough, Logan.

218
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:14,937
I'm confused.

219
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:18,742
I came here to say goodbye
to a man I once knew.

220
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:20,612
I am the same man.

221
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:23,276
I was not ready to die then.

222
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:25,946
I am not ready to die now.

223
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:27,952
But you are...

224
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,957
aren't you?

225
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:34,464
Are you offering to kill me?

226
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:35,224
No.

227
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:37,264
Not right away.

228
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:41,097
You can live a long and ordinary life.

229
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:44,300
Fall in love, have a family...

230
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:46,376
grow old.

231
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:51,779
And one day, die an ordinary death.

232
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:57,554
It can be done.

233
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:03,121
Yeah, look, nice to see you again.
Sorry you got sick.

234
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:06,321
<i>Please, Logan-san.
I need you again.</i>

235
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:08,932
I fear for my family.

236
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,568
I fear for everything I have built.

237
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,897
<i>- Enough. You should leave.
- Please, Logan-san.</i>

238
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,505
They're going to kill her.

239
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:16,333
Who?

240
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:18,601
Mariko, my granddaughter.

241
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:22,806
She is my treasure.
She must be protected.

242
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:28,779
You don't want what I've got.

243
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:31,749
<i>Kuzuri.</i>

244
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:33,351
<i>Kuzuri!</i>

245
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:34,986
He needs a sedative.

246
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:38,296
Breathe slowly and calm yourself.

247
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,636
Careful, careful.
It's slippery out here.

248
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:27,970
Let go.

249
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:31,906
You about done?

250
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:35,345
Let go of me.

251
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,936
He just wanted to say goodbye, huh?

252
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:07,014
You two grew up together.

253
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:08,914
Yes.

254
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:11,184
But you're not her sister.

255
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,682
No.

256
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:19,189
Master Yashida found me
on a trip to the South.

257
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:23,091
He brought Mariko to see a factory
he was building.

258
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:29,637
I was digging through the garbage
for something to eat.

259
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:33,270
So they just took you home with them?

260
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:37,979
It was always difficult for Mariko
to make friends.

261
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:49,757
I'll see to it
the plane is ready in the morning.

262
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:52,159
Sleep here.

263
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:02,406
<i>Eternity can be a curse...</i>

264
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:04,570
<i>Kuzuri.</i>

265
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:08,110
<i>You have no pain, Kuzuri?</i>

266
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:09,337
How old are you?

267
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:11,448
Interesting offer.

268
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,948
What are you doing
turning the old man down?

269
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:21,181
I thought you wanted to be with me.

270
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:22,683
Come here.

271
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:14,433
He's dead.

272
00:30:17,682 --> 00:30:19,809
I didn't foresee it.

273
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:58,271
Who's that? With Mariko.

274
00:31:58,449 --> 00:31:59,939
His name is Noburo Mori.

275
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:02,678
Minister of Justice, a rising star.

276
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:05,414
He's Mariko's fiancé.

277
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,581
You need to bow.

278
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:15,057
Bow.

279
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:21,602
Lord Shingen, this is Mr. Logan.

280
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,638
I know who he is.

281
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:25,937
Your father was a good man.

282
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:29,744
He would often say the same about you.

283
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:34,607
But then, he was always
fascinated with your kind.

284
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:40,881
Tell me, why do you think
he sent our little Yukio to fetch you?

285
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:44,327
To say goodbye.

286
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:48,158
And now you have.

287
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,391
Time for you to go back to your cave.

288
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:09,517
Anyone else you want me to meet?

289
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,838
I pledge to you...

290
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:32,943
Master Yashida...

291
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:36,112
to be vigilant...

292
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:38,210
and to dedicate my life...

293
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:40,383
to protect Mariko.

294
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,621
<i>That armor
belonged to Shiruba-Samurai...</i>

295
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:51,091
the Silver Samurai.

296
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:54,663
It will stand watch
over the old man forever.

297
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:13,006
Logan?

298
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:20,656
Hey. Something's not right.

299
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:23,894
Let go.

300
00:34:51,055 --> 00:34:52,079
Logan!

301
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:56,388
Logan!

302
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:23,913
Logan!

303
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:05,582
<i>Kuzuri.</i>

304
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:09,182
Let's go. Come on, let's go!

305
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,470
Yukio!

306
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:24,608
Mariko!

307
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:12,245
Mariko!

308
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:05,599
Come on. Let's go, let's go.

309
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,027
Here, here! Here!

310
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:46,409
Move!

311
00:39:47,251 --> 00:39:49,378
In here!
Move!

312
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:06,667
Keep moving, keep moving.

313
00:40:07,304 --> 00:40:08,931
Move!

314
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:19,609
You're bleeding. You need help.

315
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:21,274
Just keep moving.

316
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:32,326
Thank you for what you did back there.

317
00:40:32,496 --> 00:40:34,054
- Those were Yakuza.
- I'm fine.

318
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:35,892
Why are they after you?

319
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:38,591
I'm fine. I can make my way from here.

320
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:42,398
You should go. Get yourself a doctor.

321
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:35,180
That's nice.

322
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:39,754
This is one of those bullet trains, right?

323
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:41,761
I told you I don't need your help.

324
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:46,126
So what do they do, like,
300 miles an hour?

325
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:57,109
This cowardly attack was...

326
00:41:57,481 --> 00:41:59,210
the work of Yakuza thugs.

327
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:03,519
A violent response to my efforts...

328
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:06,884
to crack down on organized crime.

329
00:42:09,226 --> 00:42:11,854
They exited the North Gate.

330
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:14,960
She was with the stranger...

331
00:42:21,805 --> 00:42:24,069
<i>Your gaijin friend, where is he?</i>

332
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:26,736
Last I saw,
he was protecting your daughter.

333
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:30,842
You are a toy doll.

334
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:34,143
A companion for a child
who has outgrown you.

335
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:36,513
Keep that in mind.

336
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:51,033
So, where are we headed, Mariko?

337
00:42:55,606 --> 00:42:56,698
Where are we going?

338
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:03,076
I'm going to the end of the line.
My family has a home in the South.

339
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:04,876
That's stupid.

340
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:08,483
No offense, but they're gonna know
to look for you there.

341
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:10,616
Not this place.

342
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:12,983
- You want to be left alone.
- Yes.

343
00:43:13,123 --> 00:43:14,090
- I understand.
- Do you?

344
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:15,781
Oh, yeah. Trust me.

345
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,052
Problem is, if I do that...

346
00:43:17,227 --> 00:43:19,508
I don't think you're gonna live
to see the end of the day.

347
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:26,666
You can't pretend shit isn't happening
when it is, princess.

348
00:43:26,837 --> 00:43:30,568
Unless you want to die. In that case,
you're playing this perfectly.

349
00:43:54,698 --> 00:43:56,359
What the hell?

350
00:44:17,287 --> 00:44:19,156
What the hell is happening?

351
00:47:03,787 --> 00:47:04,776
What happened to you?

352
00:47:04,955 --> 00:47:06,824
We get off here. Let's go.

353
00:47:07,224 --> 00:47:09,584
Just listen to me, will you?
We need to find someplace safe.

354
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:12,390
I don't understand.
How do you know they were Yakuza?

355
00:47:12,563 --> 00:47:14,164
They were the same guys from the temple.

356
00:47:14,464 --> 00:47:15,522
How do you know they were after me?

357
00:47:15,699 --> 00:47:17,894
Look, we need to find someplace safe.
We need to get off the streets.

358
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:19,968
- I don't understand.
- Shut up! Listen.

359
00:47:20,137 --> 00:47:22,537
Do you know this place?
Where's downtown?

360
00:47:22,706 --> 00:47:24,264
Straight ahead.

361
00:47:33,784 --> 00:47:35,775
So, where's the nice part of town?

362
00:47:35,953 --> 00:47:37,215
Another eight blocks that way.

363
00:47:37,387 --> 00:47:39,446
Good. We're staying here.

364
00:47:39,823 --> 00:47:41,415
Let's go.

365
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:48,423
This is a love hotel.

366
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:49,964
A what?

367
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:51,657
A love hotel.

368
00:47:52,903 --> 00:47:55,599
For couples, understand?

369
00:47:56,673 --> 00:47:58,140
Right.

370
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:00,103
Hey.

371
00:48:00,277 --> 00:48:04,441
Two rooms.
Adjoining rooms, on the same floor.

372
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:06,979
Right next to each other. Very close.

373
00:48:07,618 --> 00:48:09,518
Same floor. Same floor.

374
00:48:28,605 --> 00:48:29,765
What did she say?

375
00:48:30,674 --> 00:48:33,802
She has no rooms available
next to each other.

376
00:48:33,977 --> 00:48:38,880
She's asking if we prefer
"the dungeon", "the nurse's office... "

377
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:42,345
or the "mission to Mars. "

378
00:48:58,402 --> 00:48:59,869
This'll do.

379
00:49:03,907 --> 00:49:06,068
<i>Liftoff! We have a liftoff!</i>

380
00:49:06,243 --> 00:49:08,404
Kind of homey, actually.

381
00:49:15,752 --> 00:49:17,413
Where do you plan on sleeping?

382
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:21,020
I don't.

383
00:49:45,949 --> 00:49:47,439
That's a lot of blood.

384
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:53,055
I thought you were done being the hero.

385
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:56,682
But these guys were... trying to kill her.

386
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:01,454
Just let it go.

387
00:50:02,933 --> 00:50:04,594
It's not hard to die.

388
00:50:07,404 --> 00:50:09,235
Come to me.

389
00:51:13,937 --> 00:51:18,533
This is Mieko from the hotel
and her grandson, Hitoshi.

390
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:20,266
Is he a doctor?

391
00:51:20,777 --> 00:51:23,109
In a manner of speaking, yes.

392
00:51:23,513 --> 00:51:25,640
He's a veterinarian...

393
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:28,447
student.

394
00:51:29,052 --> 00:51:30,679
Large animal.

395
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:36,156
Thanks.

396
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:44,326
You may have cut him once or twice
while he was stitching you.

397
00:51:44,501 --> 00:51:47,527
Okay, okay, okay.

398
00:51:56,813 --> 00:51:57,472
Hey.

399
00:51:59,716 --> 00:52:01,343
Thank you.

400
00:52:06,523 --> 00:52:08,753
I never needed this before.

401
00:52:08,925 --> 00:52:11,257
What? Help?

402
00:52:16,266 --> 00:52:20,066
That doctor, the one who helped
your grandfather, the blonde.

403
00:52:20,237 --> 00:52:21,226
Who is she?

404
00:52:21,404 --> 00:52:24,931
He met her last year
when he was in America for treatment.

405
00:52:25,742 --> 00:52:30,008
Your grandfather told me my healing
could be taken from me, passed on.

406
00:52:31,848 --> 00:52:34,316
I'm not getting better, not like before.

407
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,446
She did this to me.

408
00:52:48,765 --> 00:52:49,754
Blondie!

409
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:51,990
Blondie!

410
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:59,800
How much? How much, yeah?
How much?

411
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:23,261
You kept me waiting two hours.
You have no respect.

412
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:24,993
So you haven't found them?

413
00:53:28,805 --> 00:53:31,205
Don't play with me, bitch.
I could kill you.

414
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:35,208
If you could make me feel something,
Harada, that would be sublime.

415
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:39,314
I can slit your pretty mouth open, before
you open it to say one more stupid...

416
00:53:43,653 --> 00:53:46,520
I asked you to do one thing, little man.

417
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:48,482
Bring me the mutant.

418
00:53:48,658 --> 00:53:51,525
I don't work for you.
I work for the House of...

419
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:56,560
You work for Yashida, I get it.

420
00:53:58,368 --> 00:54:01,462
Yet you cannot fulfill his dying wish.

421
00:54:02,172 --> 00:54:05,539
My God, if you had any idea
how much you have failed him.

422
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:08,974
Where is Logan?
I am not done with him.

423
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:16,752
The mutant has powers.

424
00:54:18,221 --> 00:54:22,021
He's just a man now.
His flesh is weak now.

425
00:54:22,492 --> 00:54:23,891
I did that.

426
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:26,688
I suppressed his power so he
could be taken.

427
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:30,093
You see, it's me you should respect.

428
00:54:33,536 --> 00:54:37,307
Just find them,
before the Yakuza.

429
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:06,826
We get off here.

430
00:55:25,955 --> 00:55:27,752
Where are we?

431
00:55:28,692 --> 00:55:30,489
Just outside Nagasaki.

432
00:55:39,636 --> 00:55:41,035
This way.

433
00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:01,655
This is the guy from the
funeral, the archer.

434
00:56:03,126 --> 00:56:04,957
He was your boyfriend.

435
00:56:05,128 --> 00:56:07,221
That's Harada.

436
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:10,396
We were village champions that summer.

437
00:56:11,468 --> 00:56:15,461
He with the bow and me with the knives.

438
00:56:21,177 --> 00:56:23,668
Harada and I were planning to get married.

439
00:56:23,847 --> 00:56:25,439
What stopped you?

440
00:56:25,615 --> 00:56:26,877
Grandfather.

441
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:29,712
He said we had to wait
until we were at least 15.

442
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:40,229
From the mountain, from the sea.

443
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:55,075
Chopsticks upright are a bad omen.

444
00:56:56,045 --> 00:56:58,104
It resembles incense at a funeral.

445
00:57:01,651 --> 00:57:04,085
Nothing is without meaning.

446
00:57:05,555 --> 00:57:09,651
So, the other night at the house,
when you ran out in the rain...

447
00:57:09,826 --> 00:57:11,987
what did that mean?

448
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:15,723
My grandfather was dying.

449
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:19,568
You knew he was gonna die.
He'd been sick for a long time.

450
00:57:19,736 --> 00:57:22,227
It wasn't his death I feared.

451
00:57:22,839 --> 00:57:24,670
So, what, then?

452
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:28,843
What did he tell you that night?

453
00:57:32,348 --> 00:57:34,748
Mariko, why did your father hit you?

454
00:57:35,819 --> 00:57:37,343
I was trying to warn him.

455
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,147
About what?

456
00:57:40,657 --> 00:57:42,989
What did your grandfather tell you?

457
00:57:45,094 --> 00:57:48,291
He told me that...

458
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:54,869
in three days,
when they read his will...

459
00:57:57,207 --> 00:58:01,507
I will become
the most powerful person in Japan.

460
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:06,109
He gave it all to me.

461
00:58:07,784 --> 00:58:08,944
The company?

462
00:58:13,189 --> 00:58:15,180
I didn't want it.

463
00:58:17,293 --> 00:58:19,352
He knew that.

464
00:58:20,563 --> 00:58:23,293
I don't understand why he gave it to me.

465
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:26,064
It was all my father dreamed of.

466
00:58:27,203 --> 00:58:29,068
Well, that's why.

467
00:58:33,309 --> 00:58:35,709
What about this fiancé of yours?
Nostromo.

468
00:58:36,646 --> 00:58:37,874
Noburo.

469
00:58:38,047 --> 00:58:39,674
Does he know about this?

470
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:41,180
No.

471
00:58:42,585 --> 00:58:44,348
Why are you marrying him?

472
00:58:44,754 --> 00:58:46,813
He seems like kind of an asshole.

473
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:51,023
My father arranged it last year.

474
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:52,552
What?

475
00:58:52,729 --> 00:58:55,926
It gives him a better access
to the political theater.

476
00:58:59,402 --> 00:59:02,667
To disobey my father
would be to dishonor him.

477
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:09,978
I don't expect you to understand.

478
00:59:12,682 --> 00:59:15,014
You're not Japanese.

479
00:59:21,324 --> 00:59:25,226
Our island is long and thin.

480
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:27,787
Trains only run in two directions.

481
00:59:28,498 --> 00:59:29,897
I assure you Lord Shingen...

482
00:59:30,099 --> 00:59:31,930
my officers are making every effort...

483
00:59:32,135 --> 00:59:33,966
Then they're idiots.

484
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:36,104
You've wasted enough of my time.

485
00:59:36,973 --> 00:59:38,998
I have my father's affairs to attend to.

486
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:43,109
Get out and find her!

487
00:59:48,885 --> 00:59:52,082
Tell me you have more promising news
from your contacts.

488
00:59:52,855 --> 00:59:54,823
They open the will in three days.

489
00:59:55,325 --> 00:59:57,088
We are running out of time.

490
00:59:58,394 --> 01:00:00,555
Soon, I hope.

491
01:00:01,197 --> 01:00:02,892
I'm sending men to the South.

492
01:00:03,066 --> 01:00:05,091
That's where we found the bodies.

493
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:17,910
If the Yakuza got into the funeral...

494
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:19,543
they had someone inside.

495
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:22,213
They'll never find me here.

496
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:25,048
You're not safe.

497
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:27,889
I'm coming down there.

498
01:00:28,424 --> 01:00:29,482
They'll follow you.

499
01:00:29,892 --> 01:00:31,086
Please.

500
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:33,751
Wait a few days.

501
01:00:34,063 --> 01:00:35,257
Please. I'm fine.

502
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:37,163
Logan's here.

503
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:39,401
He's wounded, Mariko.

504
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:42,271
Someone's here.

505
01:00:42,405 --> 01:00:43,099
Mariko?

506
01:00:43,206 --> 01:00:44,070
I have to go.

507
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,400
Mariko?

508
01:00:48,711 --> 01:00:51,339
A tree fell on the road.

509
01:00:51,781 --> 01:00:54,614
The men could use some help.

510
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:28,543
Are you okay?

511
01:01:32,422 --> 01:01:33,286
Tired.

512
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:35,551
Do you need something?

513
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:38,749
No.

514
01:01:47,837 --> 01:01:48,963
This will help.

515
01:02:40,623 --> 01:02:42,284
It's time.

516
01:02:45,161 --> 01:02:46,150
What?

517
01:02:47,196 --> 01:02:49,892
Please. Take it.

518
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:52,958
Thank you.

519
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:12,651
No.

520
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:15,814
Two hands.

521
01:03:16,325 --> 01:03:20,125
Japanese sword require two hands.

522
01:03:24,901 --> 01:03:25,663
Like that?

523
01:03:25,835 --> 01:03:27,063
That's it.

524
01:03:29,705 --> 01:03:31,673
It's beautiful, Yashida.

525
01:03:34,577 --> 01:03:35,805
But I can't take it.

526
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:37,574
Please.

527
01:03:38,681 --> 01:03:39,978
Thank you.

528
01:03:46,389 --> 01:03:47,549
Keep it safe.

529
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:52,358
Keep it safe for me.

530
01:03:54,897 --> 01:03:57,491
Someday, I'll come get it.

531
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:07,005
It's time.

532
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:57,318
I was here when it happened.

533
01:04:59,829 --> 01:05:02,229
It's how I met your grandfather.

534
01:05:02,598 --> 01:05:04,657
We hid in there.

535
01:05:06,269 --> 01:05:07,736
I heard the stories.

536
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:14,000
My grandfather would say...

537
01:05:14,176 --> 01:05:17,339
what happened here was proof
that everything in the world finds peace.

538
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:24,075
Eventually.

539
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:30,892
That man can recover from anything.

540
01:05:34,964 --> 01:05:37,455
Maybe you, too.

541
01:05:43,372 --> 01:05:45,567
You don't sleep very well.

542
01:05:45,741 --> 01:05:47,709
You call out in the night.

543
01:05:54,317 --> 01:05:55,614
Who's Jean?

544
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:13,329
We should go back. There's rain coming.

545
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:01,339
This isn't right.

546
01:07:14,997 --> 01:07:18,228
You need this tied
like a proper samurai.

547
01:07:22,238 --> 01:07:24,399
Your grandfather called me a ronin.

548
01:07:25,841 --> 01:07:28,173
A samurai without a master.

549
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:33,209
He said
I was destined to live forever...

550
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:36,750
with no reason to live.

551
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:43,248
Was he right?

552
01:07:44,493 --> 01:07:45,824
Yes.

553
01:07:51,033 --> 01:07:52,728
Still?

554
01:08:41,917 --> 01:08:42,906
Hey.

555
01:08:43,919 --> 01:08:45,443
What are you doing?

556
01:08:50,059 --> 01:08:52,550
This isn't going to end well.

557
01:08:56,932 --> 01:08:58,923
Everyone you love dies.

558
01:09:19,622 --> 01:09:21,613
<i>Kuzuri.</i>

559
01:09:23,726 --> 01:09:25,387
Do you know what that means?

560
01:09:30,099 --> 01:09:31,930
An animal.

561
01:09:32,101 --> 01:09:37,334
A fierce creature
with long claws and sharp teeth.

562
01:09:39,441 --> 01:09:41,466
It fears nothing.

563
01:09:43,245 --> 01:09:47,306
When I was a girl, I had nightmares.

564
01:09:47,983 --> 01:09:50,349
I'd wake up and run to my parents.

565
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:54,016
My father would get angry.

566
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:01,520
"Go back to sleep. Face your fears. "

567
01:10:02,998 --> 01:10:05,489
My grandfather was different.

568
01:10:06,435 --> 01:10:10,201
<i>He told me stories about Kuzuri,
his friend.</i>

569
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:14,166
Who he met at the bottom of a well.

570
01:10:16,312 --> 01:10:20,772
<i>He said the Kuzuri was magical
and saved his life.</i>

571
01:10:23,118 --> 01:10:28,454
<i>He said Kuzuri would protect me, too,
as I slept in my bed.</i>

572
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:39,224
Who's Jean?

573
01:10:46,909 --> 01:10:48,399
Is she like you?

574
01:10:51,146 --> 01:10:53,137
What happened to her?

575
01:10:54,516 --> 01:10:56,381
She died.

576
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:04,855
I killed her.

577
01:11:11,533 --> 01:11:13,433
<i>Along with the Kuzuri.</i>

578
01:11:54,877 --> 01:11:56,139
Logan.

579
01:12:10,492 --> 01:12:12,392
Mariko?

580
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:15,728
Logan!

581
01:12:16,632 --> 01:12:17,929
Logan!

582
01:12:19,501 --> 01:12:20,593
Mariko?

583
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:22,464
Mariko!

584
01:12:23,238 --> 01:12:25,172
No! Logan!

585
01:12:30,946 --> 01:12:32,106
No!

586
01:12:33,182 --> 01:12:34,012
Logan!

587
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:35,674
No!

588
01:12:47,763 --> 01:12:48,525
Mariko!

589
01:12:52,301 --> 01:12:53,290
Logan!

590
01:12:54,937 --> 01:12:56,063
No!

591
01:12:58,440 --> 01:12:59,407
Logan!

592
01:13:00,509 --> 01:13:02,272
Mariko! Mariko!

593
01:13:02,444 --> 01:13:03,911
Logan!

594
01:13:24,366 --> 01:13:25,594
Where are they taking her?

595
01:13:25,834 --> 01:13:27,495
Where are they taking her?

596
01:13:27,669 --> 01:13:29,136
Where, you piece of shit?

597
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:33,599
<i>I no talk, gaijin.</i>

598
01:13:34,276 --> 01:13:36,176
I never talk.

599
01:13:42,651 --> 01:13:44,778
Who hired you?

600
01:13:55,798 --> 01:13:57,698
Uh-oh.

601
01:14:07,976 --> 01:14:09,637
Take me to Noburo.

602
01:14:10,512 --> 01:14:12,309
- Logan...
- Take me to him.

603
01:14:13,248 --> 01:14:14,476
I need to tell you something.

604
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:16,584
Do it. Now.

605
01:14:35,871 --> 01:14:37,771
You wait in the car.

606
01:14:38,273 --> 01:14:40,264
- Logan.
- What?

607
01:14:41,109 --> 01:14:43,043
I saw you die.

608
01:14:43,212 --> 01:14:44,679
What?

609
01:14:45,214 --> 01:14:46,943
I saw you die.

610
01:14:47,382 --> 01:14:49,373
When? Just now?

611
01:14:49,818 --> 01:14:51,513
A while ago.

612
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:54,587
But it's not like
I get a complete picture.

613
01:14:54,756 --> 01:14:56,986
More like looking through a keyhole.

614
01:14:58,594 --> 01:15:00,824
But I'm always right.

615
01:15:01,730 --> 01:15:05,063
All I can see
is one part of a person's life...

616
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:07,225
their death.

617
01:15:07,936 --> 01:15:10,166
And I saw yours.

618
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:15,276
So, what did you see?

619
01:15:15,744 --> 01:15:20,078
I see you on your back.
There's blood everywhere.

620
01:15:22,084 --> 01:15:25,110
You're holding your own heart
in your hand.

621
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:29,180
It's not beating.

622
01:15:30,025 --> 01:15:31,305
I don't have time for this shit.

623
01:15:31,627 --> 01:15:35,461
When I was five,
I knew how my own parents would die.

624
01:15:37,799 --> 01:15:41,291
Then I watched it happen
from the back seat.

625
01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:45,433
Look at me.

626
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:51,274
A lot of people have tried to kill me,
and I'm still here.

627
01:15:51,713 --> 01:15:53,374
Yeah...

628
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:56,040
but you're different now, aren't you?

629
01:15:56,818 --> 01:15:58,718
They can hurt you.

630
01:15:58,887 --> 01:16:00,878
They can kill you.

631
01:16:01,056 --> 01:16:03,047
Just wait in the car.

632
01:16:13,902 --> 01:16:14,862
I said, wait in the car.

633
01:16:14,903 --> 01:16:15,892
You need backup.

634
01:16:16,071 --> 01:16:17,971
You're not safe, not in your condition.

635
01:16:19,942 --> 01:16:22,274
Just think of me as your bodyguard.

636
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:33,083
Sexy.

637
01:16:40,128 --> 01:16:40,924
Come on!

638
01:16:41,096 --> 01:16:42,085
I'm coming.

639
01:16:50,572 --> 01:16:53,598
Okay, round four. Here we go.

640
01:17:06,755 --> 01:17:08,188
Drink for you, my lady.

641
01:17:16,164 --> 01:17:17,256
Get out.

642
01:17:22,871 --> 01:17:24,600
Not you.

643
01:17:26,508 --> 01:17:27,702
Call me old-fashioned...

644
01:17:27,876 --> 01:17:30,836
but I thought being engaged meant
you were done with this kind of bullshit.

645
01:17:30,879 --> 01:17:33,609
I am the Minister of Justice. Do you
have any idea what I could do to you?

646
01:17:33,782 --> 01:17:37,548
Really? You're gonna try and talk tough,
standing there in your red underwear?

647
01:17:38,020 --> 01:17:39,180
You have ten words...

648
01:17:39,354 --> 01:17:41,618
ten words...

649
01:17:41,790 --> 01:17:46,159
to explain to me why you,
the Minister of Justice...

650
01:17:46,328 --> 01:17:49,161
would want your fiancé
killed by the Yakuza.

651
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:53,199
If I don't like what you say,
you are going through that window.

652
01:17:53,368 --> 01:17:55,461
You don't have the faintest idea
what's going on...

653
01:17:58,240 --> 01:17:59,366
How many words was that?

654
01:17:59,541 --> 01:18:00,200
Nine.

655
01:18:00,375 --> 01:18:02,969
Nine. You have one word left.

656
01:18:06,014 --> 01:18:06,742
Really?

657
01:18:08,717 --> 01:18:10,207
Shingen. Shingen!

658
01:18:12,254 --> 01:18:13,414
Keep going.

659
01:18:15,557 --> 01:18:16,888
Since he got sick...

660
01:18:17,059 --> 01:18:20,551
old man Yashida spent billions
on doctors, healers.

661
01:18:20,729 --> 01:18:23,493
Stockpiling adamantium
at his lab in the North...

662
01:18:23,665 --> 01:18:26,031
secretly trying to prolong his life.

663
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:29,329
He brought the company
to the edge of bankruptcy.

664
01:18:29,504 --> 01:18:31,665
He was obsessed with you.

665
01:18:34,242 --> 01:18:35,539
English!

666
01:18:36,078 --> 01:18:39,070
Shingen lied, protected the old man...

667
01:18:39,247 --> 01:18:42,444
concealed the debt
from stockholders and the board.

668
01:18:42,617 --> 01:18:45,017
He tried to be a good son
and thought he'd be rewarded.

669
01:18:46,121 --> 01:18:48,214
And then the old man
left everything to his granddaughter.

670
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:50,950
If Mariko got all that power,
she would dump his ass.

671
01:18:51,126 --> 01:18:52,058
It's true.

672
01:18:52,227 --> 01:18:55,287
Mariko would have never
gone through with the wedding...

673
01:18:55,464 --> 01:18:57,955
not once the will was revealed.

674
01:18:58,734 --> 01:18:59,860
She never took to me.

675
01:19:00,302 --> 01:19:03,100
Oh, really? A class act like you.

676
01:19:03,805 --> 01:19:06,433
Shingen promised me
a fortune for my help.

677
01:19:07,609 --> 01:19:11,204
So, you put a hit on his daughter.
Is that it?

678
01:19:12,314 --> 01:19:14,305
Political careers don't last forever.

679
01:19:15,083 --> 01:19:15,981
That's right.

680
01:19:16,284 --> 01:19:18,115
Wait! Wait! No!

681
01:19:18,286 --> 01:19:21,050
You wanted the truth.
I told you the truth!

682
01:19:21,990 --> 01:19:23,753
I didn't like it.

683
01:19:24,426 --> 01:19:25,757
Wow.

684
01:19:27,629 --> 01:19:29,062
How did you know
there's a pool down there?

685
01:19:29,231 --> 01:19:30,596
I didn't.

686
01:19:46,948 --> 01:19:51,248
Did you know I studied biology in college?

687
01:19:53,221 --> 01:19:54,654
Genetics.

688
01:19:58,660 --> 01:20:01,094
There are genes that skip generations.

689
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:03,393
Recessive genes.

690
01:20:06,234 --> 01:20:06,934
Eyes.

691
01:20:06,935 --> 01:20:08,129
Eyes. Hair.

692
01:20:09,504 --> 01:20:10,732
Talent.

693
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:13,605
Temperament.

694
01:20:15,777 --> 01:20:18,974
Not every child gets the same.

695
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:21,908
My father saw little of himself in me.

696
01:20:23,118 --> 01:20:24,608
But in you...

697
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:27,352
he faced a mirror.

698
01:20:46,942 --> 01:20:48,409
How did you convince my father...

699
01:20:48,643 --> 01:20:50,042
to award you control...

700
01:20:50,278 --> 01:20:51,711
of Asia's largest corporation?

701
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:53,647
You've gone insane.

702
01:20:55,183 --> 01:20:56,980
I'm just waking up.

703
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:00,210
If you kill me, you will lose...

704
01:21:00,522 --> 01:21:02,319
what little honor you have left.

705
01:21:06,161 --> 01:21:07,287
Fear not Mariko.

706
01:21:07,629 --> 01:21:09,893
I don't want to hurt you.

707
01:21:10,332 --> 01:21:11,458
I want to help you.

708
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:13,327
Help you end your pain...

709
01:21:13,568 --> 01:21:14,808
what that mutant stopped you...

710
01:21:15,003 --> 01:21:16,231
from doing last week.

711
01:21:16,504 --> 01:21:18,665
I never wanted to die, Father.

712
01:21:36,224 --> 01:21:37,486
It's alright, Mariko.

713
01:21:42,731 --> 01:21:43,425
Come with me.

714
01:21:43,598 --> 01:21:44,394
What is happening?!

715
01:21:44,766 --> 01:21:46,893
More than you can imagine.

716
01:21:55,076 --> 01:21:56,839
You.

717
01:21:57,279 --> 01:21:58,712
Me.

718
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:02,611
Sorry to interrupt,
but I need your daughter alive.

719
01:22:02,784 --> 01:22:04,115
What are you?

720
01:22:04,953 --> 01:22:07,353
A chemist, a nihilist...

721
01:22:07,789 --> 01:22:11,225
a capitalist, a mutation.

722
01:22:14,829 --> 01:22:16,319
A viper.

723
01:22:46,561 --> 01:22:48,392
Where is the security?

724
01:22:50,532 --> 01:22:51,521
Shingen?

725
01:23:09,317 --> 01:23:10,579
Logan.

726
01:23:21,229 --> 01:23:22,753
This. This here.

727
01:23:22,931 --> 01:23:24,558
Where is this?

728
01:23:27,802 --> 01:23:29,770
Master Yashida's birthplace.

729
01:23:30,805 --> 01:23:33,603
The company built a facility
into the mountainside.

730
01:23:37,345 --> 01:23:38,607
How far?

731
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:41,874
500 kilometers from here.

732
01:24:48,783 --> 01:24:51,081
I gotta get that thing out of me.

733
01:24:51,619 --> 01:24:52,551
How?

734
01:24:52,954 --> 01:24:54,080
No, stop, Logan.

735
01:24:54,255 --> 01:24:57,247
I saw you die. I'm never wrong.

736
01:24:57,425 --> 01:24:58,483
I'm never wrong.

737
01:24:58,660 --> 01:24:59,620
You're not always right.

738
01:24:59,627 --> 01:25:00,821
You didn't know
the old man was gonna bite it.

739
01:25:00,995 --> 01:25:02,895
I saw you die in a room like this
with your heart in your hand.

740
01:25:03,064 --> 01:25:04,944
I can't leave her with
those freaks and killers.

741
01:25:05,233 --> 01:25:08,498
I'm the only chance she's got,
but not with that thing inside me.

742
01:25:08,670 --> 01:25:10,831
- You're going to die, Logan.
- Maybe that's okay.

743
01:25:11,806 --> 01:25:13,637
No, listen to me, Logan!

744
01:25:13,808 --> 01:25:15,799
No, stop. Logan!

745
01:25:16,911 --> 01:25:18,310
You're not gonna want
to watch this part.

746
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:20,948
No! Listen to me! Please, no!

747
01:25:21,649 --> 01:25:24,174
No, stop. Listen to me.

748
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:26,478
Logan!

749
01:25:35,263 --> 01:25:36,321
Move!

750
01:25:36,498 --> 01:25:37,988
Stay away from him.

751
01:25:39,367 --> 01:25:41,164
He killed your master.

752
01:25:41,803 --> 01:25:44,533
Put hands on your sister.

753
01:25:44,806 --> 01:25:46,671
And now you want him?

754
01:25:49,410 --> 01:25:51,241
Oh, no. I can't see.

755
01:25:52,147 --> 01:25:54,081
You'll always be a beggar.

756
01:25:54,249 --> 01:25:55,181
You're crazy.

757
01:26:03,525 --> 01:26:04,549
Oh, no.

758
01:26:35,757 --> 01:26:37,019
Yukio.

759
01:26:56,544 --> 01:26:57,602
Logan!

760
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:06,914
Logan! Logan!

761
01:27:07,789 --> 01:27:08,881
Logan!

762
01:27:45,793 --> 01:27:47,784
Don't hit my friends.

763
01:27:50,865 --> 01:27:51,957
Where's Mariko?

764
01:27:52,133 --> 01:27:54,931
She's gone. That Viper bitch took her.

765
01:27:55,103 --> 01:27:57,469
It was my father's obsession...

766
01:27:58,172 --> 01:28:00,936
with mutation, with God's mistakes...

767
01:28:02,477 --> 01:28:06,641
like you and her,
that ruined this house.

768
01:29:18,219 --> 01:29:19,880
You tried to kill your daughter.

769
01:29:22,557 --> 01:29:24,024
Live with that.

770
01:29:39,207 --> 01:29:42,005
What kind of monster are you?

771
01:29:42,877 --> 01:29:44,435
The Wolverine.

772
01:29:57,759 --> 01:30:00,785
Hey, come here, come here. That's it.

773
01:30:01,629 --> 01:30:02,459
I was wrong.

774
01:30:03,097 --> 01:30:04,530
I told you.

775
01:30:04,699 --> 01:30:06,428
Let me have a look at you.

776
01:30:07,335 --> 01:30:08,768
It's nothing.

777
01:30:08,936 --> 01:30:11,598
Hey, thank you.

778
01:30:20,314 --> 01:30:22,612
It's a trap, Logan.

779
01:30:41,869 --> 01:30:43,928
Why have you brought me here?

780
01:30:44,505 --> 01:30:45,836
What are you hiding?

781
01:30:46,174 --> 01:30:47,698
You will soon find out.

782
01:30:49,844 --> 01:30:51,971
Welcome, Mariko.

783
01:30:53,147 --> 01:30:56,310
It's all right, Mariko.
She also serves the House of Yashida.

784
01:30:56,484 --> 01:30:57,883
She serves herself.

785
01:30:58,052 --> 01:31:00,316
She infected Logan.

786
01:31:02,056 --> 01:31:03,182
And what about Grandfather?

787
01:31:04,158 --> 01:31:05,785
What did you infect him with?

788
01:31:08,629 --> 01:31:10,995
I granted his dying wish.

789
01:31:11,632 --> 01:31:13,725
I helped him rest.

790
01:31:15,837 --> 01:31:18,169
Now, it's your turn.

791
01:32:04,685 --> 01:32:06,585
Did you have a nice rest?

792
01:32:13,828 --> 01:32:16,490
I don't know what you said or did
to deceive Harada or my grandfather...

793
01:32:16,664 --> 01:32:18,097
Now, now, calm down.

794
01:32:18,266 --> 01:32:20,257
Your grandfather sought me out.

795
01:32:20,668 --> 01:32:22,431
I am the head of this family now.

796
01:32:26,707 --> 01:32:29,267
And why do you suppose that is?

797
01:32:31,112 --> 01:32:34,081
Why do you think the old man chose you?

798
01:32:37,351 --> 01:32:39,046
Because you are strong?

799
01:32:40,021 --> 01:32:42,114
Or because you are weak?

800
01:33:37,278 --> 01:33:38,973
I see you've come to fight.

801
01:33:39,146 --> 01:33:40,306
It's pointless.

802
01:33:40,481 --> 01:33:42,813
You're weak. You're outnumbered.

803
01:33:42,984 --> 01:33:46,943
The Black Clan has protected
the House of Yashida for 700 years.

804
01:33:48,422 --> 01:33:50,049
Is that all the men you brought?

805
01:33:53,394 --> 01:33:54,986
I'm gonna get her.

806
01:33:55,596 --> 01:33:57,587
We are grateful
for your protection of Mariko.

807
01:33:57,765 --> 01:34:00,893
But there is one more sacrifice
you must make for her family.

808
01:34:02,169 --> 01:34:04,296
Go fuck yourself, pretty boy.

809
01:35:29,023 --> 01:35:30,388
Logan.

810
01:36:34,922 --> 01:36:36,321
<i>Logan.</i>

811
01:36:36,490 --> 01:36:37,582
<i>Kayla.</i>

812
01:36:37,758 --> 01:36:38,952
<i>- I love you.
- Kayla!</i>

813
01:36:39,093 --> 01:36:40,082
<i>Logan.</i>

814
01:36:45,132 --> 01:36:45,826
<i>Logan!</i>

815
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,092
<i>Mariko!</i>

816
01:36:48,602 --> 01:36:49,591
Jean.

817
01:36:50,604 --> 01:36:51,969
<i>Save me.</i>

818
01:37:24,338 --> 01:37:26,306
Stand back. There is no need.

819
01:37:26,540 --> 01:37:28,440
Where is she? Where's Mariko?

820
01:37:28,609 --> 01:37:29,541
Where is she?

821
01:37:30,477 --> 01:37:32,638
"Where is Mariko?"

822
01:37:32,813 --> 01:37:35,043
Still pining away?

823
01:37:35,216 --> 01:37:37,047
That's so sweet.

824
01:37:38,185 --> 01:37:40,119
Impressive, no?

825
01:37:40,354 --> 01:37:43,949
He is made of adamantium, just like you.

826
01:38:03,677 --> 01:38:07,408
Logan, you know what, I get it.
You're frustrated.

827
01:38:07,581 --> 01:38:09,640
I know she's here. I want to see her.

828
01:38:10,684 --> 01:38:11,981
You want answers.

829
01:38:13,020 --> 01:38:14,248
Yes, I want answers!

830
01:38:14,421 --> 01:38:18,221
I'm sorry, I wish I could say more,
but I was hired in part for my discretion.

831
01:38:18,392 --> 01:38:19,757
I'm sure you were.

832
01:38:20,394 --> 01:38:21,588
That...

833
01:38:21,762 --> 01:38:26,495
and a certain talent for combining
biochemistry and metaphysics.

834
01:38:27,034 --> 01:38:29,935
High-grade toxins are my specialty.

835
01:38:30,404 --> 01:38:35,068
It helps to be genetically immune
to every poison known to man, as I am.

836
01:38:36,076 --> 01:38:40,035
And immune to the toxin
that is man himself...

837
01:38:41,215 --> 01:38:42,546
as I am.

838
01:38:43,050 --> 01:38:45,382
I'll tell you what,
you twisted mutant bitch...

839
01:38:46,287 --> 01:38:49,848
why don't you open these bracelets
and we'll see who's made of what?

840
01:38:54,428 --> 01:38:57,090
The claws. Now we can begin.

841
01:38:59,733 --> 01:39:02,065
I know you care for him.

842
01:39:02,536 --> 01:39:03,969
You need to let go of that.

843
01:39:04,305 --> 01:39:06,296
You are a Yashida.

844
01:39:06,573 --> 01:39:08,473
She betrayed my grandfather...

845
01:39:08,976 --> 01:39:10,273
and so have you.

846
01:39:10,945 --> 01:39:11,707
No Mariko.

847
01:39:12,079 --> 01:39:13,842
We grew up together.

848
01:39:14,181 --> 01:39:15,512
You need to trust me.

849
01:39:16,750 --> 01:39:18,479
Let me go to him!

850
01:39:18,752 --> 01:39:21,152
He saved my life!

851
01:39:21,422 --> 01:39:23,720
Let him go, Mariko!

852
01:39:24,124 --> 01:39:25,284
This isn't easy for me but...

853
01:39:25,526 --> 01:39:28,427
I'm following Grandfather's wishes.

854
01:39:28,495 --> 01:39:31,931
The suppressant bug you
found inside of you was mine.

855
01:39:32,299 --> 01:39:34,859
You took it out on your own.

856
01:39:35,869 --> 01:39:37,860
I didn't see that coming.

857
01:39:38,272 --> 01:39:39,671
The Viper woman is evil...

858
01:39:39,873 --> 01:39:41,636
we both know that.

859
01:39:41,842 --> 01:39:44,606
But she's a means to an end...

860
01:39:45,045 --> 01:39:45,943
Where is she?

861
01:39:46,113 --> 01:39:47,774
An end your grandfather wanted.

862
01:39:47,848 --> 01:39:48,940
You are strong.

863
01:39:49,350 --> 01:39:50,977
You have courage.

864
01:39:51,719 --> 01:39:53,050
Real courage.

865
01:39:56,724 --> 01:39:59,522
But that won't help much now.

866
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:14,208
What the...?

867
01:40:14,875 --> 01:40:16,399
You need to trust me.

868
01:40:17,077 --> 01:40:18,374
Is that hard?

869
01:40:19,079 --> 01:40:21,673
We were meant to be together.

870
01:40:22,216 --> 01:40:24,184
We still can be.

871
01:40:25,185 --> 01:40:26,584
Perhaps.

872
01:40:55,482 --> 01:40:56,278
Stop!

873
01:41:02,556 --> 01:41:03,716
This is madness.

874
01:41:09,396 --> 01:41:10,488
Let's go.

875
01:41:13,434 --> 01:41:14,423
Go!

876
01:41:15,502 --> 01:41:16,491
Run!

877
01:41:29,917 --> 01:41:31,441
Come on.

878
01:41:47,134 --> 01:41:48,499
- Mariko, come!
- Go! Run!

879
01:42:07,821 --> 01:42:09,220
Mariko, get out!

880
01:44:53,987 --> 01:44:55,113
Come on.

881
01:44:55,956 --> 01:44:57,150
This is not the way.

882
01:45:10,637 --> 01:45:12,161
Two hands.

883
01:45:16,643 --> 01:45:17,769
Master...

884
01:45:26,019 --> 01:45:28,146
Hey! Bub!

885
01:45:47,874 --> 01:45:48,670
Harada.

886
01:45:55,349 --> 01:45:56,839
I'm sorry.

887
01:46:47,300 --> 01:46:48,324
Now, you die.

888
01:46:49,102 --> 01:46:50,501
Today is not my day.

889
01:47:35,782 --> 01:47:37,113
Hey!

890
01:47:44,324 --> 01:47:45,951
<i>Logan-san.</i>

891
01:47:46,126 --> 01:47:48,151
Don't look so shocked.

892
01:47:50,564 --> 01:47:54,398
With you at my side,
I survived Nagasaki.

893
01:47:54,568 --> 01:47:57,162
Surely, I could survive this.

894
01:47:58,839 --> 01:48:01,672
It's all right. It won't take long.

895
01:48:02,242 --> 01:48:05,234
Dr. Green and I have been waiting.

896
01:48:05,512 --> 01:48:09,073
It's only this armor
that's kept me alive.

897
01:48:09,249 --> 01:48:14,152
We built it to make me strong,
so I can take what you would not give.

898
01:48:14,321 --> 01:48:17,518
And transfer your
unwanted healing...

899
01:48:18,425 --> 01:48:20,586
to my body.

900
01:48:22,896 --> 01:48:26,161
My legacy must be preserved.

901
01:48:26,833 --> 01:48:30,428
Your mistake was to believe
that a life without end...

902
01:48:30,604 --> 01:48:31,901
can have no meaning.

903
01:48:34,875 --> 01:48:37,673
It is the only life that can.

904
01:48:39,079 --> 01:48:40,569
Hold on.

905
01:48:40,747 --> 01:48:42,544
We are almost there.

906
01:48:42,716 --> 01:48:46,743
The peace, the peace you've wanted.

907
01:48:47,187 --> 01:48:49,348
Your reward.

908
01:48:50,023 --> 01:48:53,186
You know,
I'm giving you the very death...

909
01:48:53,727 --> 01:48:55,922
you longed for.

910
01:49:08,708 --> 01:49:09,766
This feeling...

911
01:49:10,944 --> 01:49:13,435
to be invincible...

912
01:49:16,049 --> 01:49:17,778
like you.

913
01:49:30,564 --> 01:49:32,725
You are a monster.

914
01:49:33,199 --> 01:49:34,359
Mariko.

915
01:49:35,101 --> 01:49:37,626
It's me. Your grandfather.

916
01:49:39,472 --> 01:49:41,030
I buried my grandfather.

917
01:50:44,204 --> 01:50:46,832
You asked me to come say goodbye.

918
01:50:47,474 --> 01:50:49,169
<i>Sayonara.</i>

919
01:51:11,564 --> 01:51:13,395
Are you all right?

920
01:51:22,709 --> 01:51:23,698
Logan.

921
01:51:33,853 --> 01:51:35,753
Logan.

922
01:51:38,758 --> 01:51:39,918
Logan.

923
01:51:52,072 --> 01:51:53,505
You're here.

924
01:51:55,742 --> 01:51:57,437
Of course.

925
01:51:59,112 --> 01:52:01,046
Can you stay?

926
01:52:03,216 --> 01:52:05,207
I can't.

927
01:52:07,620 --> 01:52:09,281
Yes, you can.

928
01:52:11,057 --> 01:52:13,252
This is what you wanted.

929
01:52:15,395 --> 01:52:16,760
Not anymore.

930
01:52:21,701 --> 01:52:24,261
I'm all alone here.

931
01:52:28,541 --> 01:52:30,600
You put me here.

932
01:52:32,512 --> 01:52:34,946
You were hurting people, Jean.

933
01:52:36,216 --> 01:52:37,683
I had to.

934
01:52:46,192 --> 01:52:48,353
I love you, Jean.

935
01:52:53,900 --> 01:52:55,731
I always will.

936
01:53:32,438 --> 01:53:35,271
You are my only family.

937
01:53:36,843 --> 01:53:39,175
Be well, sister.

938
01:53:52,625 --> 01:53:55,822
Am I wrong to think
you might visit me soon?

939
01:54:07,373 --> 01:54:08,670
Stay.

940
01:54:10,343 --> 01:54:11,833
I can't, princess.

941
01:54:12,779 --> 01:54:16,010
I'm a soldier, and I've
been hiding too long.

942
01:54:29,729 --> 01:54:32,391
<i>In our business profile tonight,
Mariko Yashida.</i>

943
01:54:32,565 --> 01:54:35,363
<i>A two-generation passing of the torch
in the Yashida family...</i>

944
01:54:35,535 --> 01:54:39,494
<i>as Mariko Yashida takes the helm from
her grandfather, who built this tech giant.</i>

945
01:54:39,672 --> 01:54:43,904
I know it will always be the purpose
for a corporation to make a profit...

946
01:54:44,077 --> 01:54:48,343
but Yashida Industries believes
we can also work with our community.

947
01:54:54,687 --> 01:54:56,882
So, have you decided?

948
01:54:59,592 --> 01:55:00,354
What?

949
01:55:00,827 --> 01:55:03,057
Mariko says we can go wherever we want.

950
01:55:03,229 --> 01:55:04,924
Just say where.

951
01:55:06,199 --> 01:55:07,530
What are you doing?

952
01:55:09,669 --> 01:55:11,432
I'm your bodyguard.

953
01:55:16,042 --> 01:55:17,669
So, where do you want to go?

954
01:55:21,514 --> 01:55:23,414
Let's just start with up.

955
01:55:23,583 --> 01:55:25,244
And then?

956
01:55:29,255 --> 01:55:30,950
We'll see.

957
01:55:33,359 --> 01:55:34,621
Interesting.

958
01:57:26,172 --> 01:57:30,404
<i>With cutting edge technology,

963
01:57:41,454 --> 01:57:42,853
I'll take the pat-down.

964
01:57:43,022 --> 01:57:44,011
Opt out.

965
01:57:56,936 --> 01:57:59,302
- You can go ahead, sir.
- I'll wait.

966
01:58:07,914 --> 01:58:09,404
What do you want?

967
01:58:11,150 --> 01:58:13,641
There are dark forces, Wolverine.

968
01:58:15,321 --> 01:58:17,414
Human forces building a weapon...

969
01:58:17,590 --> 01:58:21,026
that could bring about the end of our kind.

970
01:58:23,863 --> 01:58:26,957
What do I want?
I want your help.

971
01:58:27,433 --> 01:58:29,025
Why would I trust you?

972
01:58:30,203 --> 01:58:31,534
You wouldn't.

973
01:58:56,195 --> 01:58:57,492
Hello, Logan.

974
01:59:01,834 --> 01:59:03,699
How is this possible?

975
01:59:03,870 --> 01:59:06,634
As I told you a long time ago...

976
01:59:07,907 --> 01:59:10,467
you are not the only one with gifts.
