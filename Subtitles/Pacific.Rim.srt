1
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:40,539
-When I was a kid,

2
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,975
- Whenever I'd feel small
or lonely,

3
00:00:42,977 --> 00:00:46,378
-I'd look up at the stars.

4
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,815
Wondered if there was life
up there.

5
00:00:49,817 --> 00:00:52,217
Turns out I was looking
in the wrong direction.

6
00:00:53,421 --> 00:00:55,254
When alien life
entered our world

7
00:00:55,256 --> 00:00:58,090
It was from deep beneath
the pacific ocean.

8
00:00:58,092 --> 00:01:01,927
A fissure between
two tectonic plates.

9
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:05,931
A portal between dimensions.

10
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:08,567
The breach.

11
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:10,769
I was fifteen
when the first Kaiju

12
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:12,938
Made land in san Francisco.

13
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,601
By the time tanks, jets
and missiles took it down

14
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:48,607
Six days and 35 miles later,
three cities were destroyed.

15
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:51,944
Tens of thousands
of lives were lost.

16
00:01:56,382 --> 00:02:00,219
We mourned our dead,
memorialized the attack,

17
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:01,587
And moved on.

18
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:09,561
And then, only six months later,

19
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:12,965
The second attack hit manila.

20
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:14,933
The acid
factor of the Kaiju blood

21
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:17,336
Creates a toxic phenomenon
named Kaiju blue.

22
00:02:17,338 --> 00:02:19,671
And then the third one hit Cabo.

23
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:22,241
And then the fourth.

24
00:02:22,243 --> 00:02:25,777
And then we learned
this was not gonna stop.

25
00:02:25,779 --> 00:02:27,946
This was just the beginning.

26
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:31,183
We needed a new weapon.

27
00:02:31,185 --> 00:02:34,419
The world came together,
pooling its resources

28
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:36,822
And throwing aside old rivalries

29
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:39,825
For the sake
of the greater good.

30
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:44,830
To fight monsters,
we created monsters of our own.

31
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:49,168
The Jaeger program was born.

32
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,603
There were setbacks at first.

33
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:53,639
The neural load to interface
with a Jaeger

34
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:57,543
Proved too much
for a single pilot.

35
00:02:57,545 --> 00:02:59,778
A twoPilot system
was implemented.

36
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,849
LeftHemisphere,
rightHemisphere pilot control.

37
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,684
We started winning.

38
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:09,021
Jaegers stopping Kaijus
everywhere.

39
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:12,457
But the jaegers were only
as good as their pilots.

40
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:15,994
So Jaeger pilots
turned into rock stars.

41
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:19,464
Danger turned into propaganda.

42
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:21,233
Kaijus into toys.

43
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:26,371
We got really good at it.

44
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:27,673
Winning.

45
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:33,679
Then..

46
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:36,014
Then it all changed.

47
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:40,919
Gipsy danger,
report to bay 08, level a42.

48
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:44,923
Kaiju. Code name: Knifehead.
Category 3.

49
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:47,192
Yo, Yancy, wake up!
Movement in the breach.

50
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:50,395
Hey, come on!
We're being deployed.

51
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:53,232
Great. Good morning.

52
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:54,666
Mornin'.

53
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:58,270
Kaiju's a category 3..
Biggest one yet.

54
00:03:58,272 --> 00:04:00,505
Code name: Knifehead.

55
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:01,907
What time is it?

56
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,542
2:00. Man: Go, go, go!
Move it!

57
00:04:03,544 --> 00:04:06,945
A.M.?
Yep.

58
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:08,380
What do you say?

59
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:09,748
Fifth notch on the belt?

60
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:15,053
Come on, beckets.
Time for the drop.

61
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:17,723
Hey, kid.
Yeah?

62
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:20,726
Don't get cocky.

63
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:22,628
Years before,

64
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:26,365
You wouldn't have picked my
brother Yancy and I for heroes.

65
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:27,399
No chance.

66
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:28,767
Good morning, sir.

67
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,969
All right, let's suit up
and kick some ass!

68
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:34,106
We were never star athletes.

69
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:36,541
Never at the head of the class.

70
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:39,645
But we could hold our own
in a fight.

71
00:04:39,647 --> 00:04:42,481
And it turned out
we had a unique skill:

72
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:44,316
We were drift compatible.

73
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:59,898
All right.

74
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,302
Data on helmet.

75
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:07,873
Data relay gel dispersing
in circuitry suit.

76
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,601
Good morning, Becket boys!

77
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:39,004
Tendo, what's happening,
my man?

78
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:41,640
How'd that date with Alison
go last night, Mr. Choi?

79
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:43,875
Oh, she loved me.
Her boyfriend? Not so much.

80
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:45,977
You're gonna get
your ass kicked.

81
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:48,613
A man's gotta do
what a man's gotta do, brother.

82
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:49,981
Engage drop, Mr. Choi.

83
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:51,783
Engaging drop, sir.

84
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:55,153
Marshal Pentecost on deck.

85
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:58,490
Securing the Conn pod.
Gettin' ready to drop.

86
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,794
Conn pod door lock secure.

87
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:06,898
Release for drop.

88
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,035
Gipsy danger ready
for the big drop.

89
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:12,037
Here we go.
Yeah!

90
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:14,639
Here we go!

91
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:24,549
Coupling confirmed, sir.

92
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:27,185
Engage pilotToPilot protocol.

93
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:29,187
Engaging now.

94
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:31,589
PilotToPilot
connection protocol sequence.

95
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:53,111
Gipsy launch, bay 6.

96
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,761
Gipsy danger ready
and aligned, sir.

97
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,196
Rangers, this is
marshal stacker Pentecost.

98
00:07:11,198 --> 00:07:12,531
Prepare for neural handshake.

99
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:13,965
Starting in 15 seconds.

100
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:14,511
14..13..

101
00:07:18,372 --> 00:07:20,205
12, 11, 10..

102
00:07:20,207 --> 00:07:22,941
Ready to step
into my head, kid?

103
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:26,378
..9, 8, 7, 6.. please, after you.
Age before beauty, old man.

104
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,780
PilotToPilot connection
protocol sequence..5, 4, 3..

105
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:32,751
Neural handshake initiated.
..2, 1.

106
00:07:32,753 --> 00:07:36,388
The drift.
Jaeger tech.

107
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:40,592
Based on Darpa jet fighter
neural systems.

108
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:43,428
Two pilots,
mindMelding through memories

109
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,730
With the body
of a giant machine.

110
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:48,133
The deeper the bond..

111
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:50,669
The better you fight.

112
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:55,106
Neural handshake
strong and holding.

113
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:58,610
Right hemisphere
is calibrating.

114
00:07:58,612 --> 00:08:00,979
Left hemisphere calibrating.

115
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:06,551
Proofed and transmitting.

116
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:16,695
Gentlemen, your orders are

117
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:18,129
To hold the miracle mile
off anchorage. Copy?

118
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:19,698
Copy that, sir.

119
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,634
Sir, there's still a civilian
vessel in the gulf..

120
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:24,669
Gentlemen, you're protecting
a city of 2 million people.

121
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,705
You will not risk those lives
for a boat that holds 10.

122
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:27,873
Am I clear?

123
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,275
Yes, sir.
Man, that's cold.

124
00:08:30,277 --> 00:08:33,879
You know what I'm thinking.

125
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:35,347
I'm in your brain.

126
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:36,982
I know.
Then let's go fishing.

127
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:38,617
Here we go!

128
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:41,286
Come on, bro!
Put some muscle to it!

129
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:44,356
Worry about yourself, kiddo!

130
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,402
There are things
you can't fight, acts of god.

131
00:08:57,404 --> 00:09:00,839
You see a hurricane coming,
you have to get out of the way.

132
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:03,041
But when you're in a Jaeger,

133
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:06,244
Suddenly, you can fight
the hurricane.

134
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:07,913
You can win.

135
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:15,520
Get 'em tied down
and go down below!

136
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:16,988
Now!

137
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,326
How far to the mainland?

138
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:23,161
7 miles off anchorage, sir.

139
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:25,163
But we won't even make it past
the shallows!

140
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:26,565
No, we won't!

141
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:28,199
What about that island
3 miles east?

142
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:31,603
No! No!
It's 2 miles, sir.

143
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:33,872
OOne mile, sir!

144
00:09:33,874 --> 00:09:35,507
It's getting closer.

145
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:38,910
How the hell
can it be getting closer?

146
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:46,151
Kaiju.

147
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,225
Harder starboard!

148
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:55,961
I'm doing it as fast as I can!

149
00:09:55,963 --> 00:09:58,530
Now!

150
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:19,084
Oh, god!

151
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:20,485
What the hell?

152
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,572
Hang on!

153
00:10:40,574 --> 00:10:41,973
Ship secure.

154
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,908
Adjust the torque!
I'm on it.

155
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,212
Torque locked.

156
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,786
Get him. Come on.
Shoot him.

157
00:11:27,788 --> 00:11:29,521
I'm on it!
I'm on it!

158
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:41,166
Discharge reading, sir.

159
00:11:41,168 --> 00:11:42,367
Plasma cannon
in the shallow shelves

160
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:44,002
7 miles off the coastal line.

161
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:45,236
Gipsy,
what the hell is going on?

162
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:47,539
Job's done, sir.
Lit it up twice.

163
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,040
Bagged our fifth kill.

164
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:52,177
You disobeyed a direct order!

165
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:54,179
Respectfully, sir,

166
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:55,413
We intercepted a Kaiju and
saved everyone on that boat.

167
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:57,315
Get back to your post, now!

168
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:00,719
Yes, sir.

169
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:03,722
Kaiju signature rising!

170
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:05,156
Sensor checks.

171
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:08,159
That thing's still alive, sir.
Gipsy!

172
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:10,495
We're still getting
a signature!

173
00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:13,364
That Kaiju is still alive!

174
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:16,067
Grab the boat
and get out of there.

175
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,669
You copy?

176
00:12:17,671 --> 00:12:21,072
Grab the boat
and get out of there now!

177
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:31,916
Take it, Raleigh!
I got this!

178
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:42,260
Loccent, we're hit!

179
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:49,100
Left arm's gone cold, sir.

180
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:09,621
The hull!
It went through the hull!

181
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:12,390
Raleigh, listen to me!
You need..

182
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:18,496
No! No!

183
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:53,531
Loading.

184
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:13,151
Second discharge fried
all the comms, sir.

185
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:14,285
I'm not getting any signals.

186
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:16,688
Pressure dropping!

187
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,690
No pressure!
No pressure!

188
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,592
No signatures, sir.

189
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:25,096
What do we do now, sir?

190
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:31,903
Now, I want you to keep
your eye on that gauge there.

191
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:34,739
Now, you know
what I'd like to find?

192
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:36,174
I'd like to find a whole ship.

193
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:37,809
That's what I'd like to find.

194
00:14:37,811 --> 00:14:39,210
Wait, wait!

195
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,645
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

196
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:42,046
Wait!
Right there, right there!

197
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,248
Dig!

198
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:46,251
Hey, what is it?

199
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:49,087
It's just an old toy.

200
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:52,757
We never find anything good.

201
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:55,760
Listen.

202
00:14:57,197 --> 00:14:58,830
Jeez!

203
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:05,770
Oh, my god.

204
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:30,161
Stay here!

205
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,017
Mister?

206
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,322
Can I help?

207
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:04,963
Yancy.

208
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:17,442
Run!
Get help, fast!

209
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:19,911
It's gonna be all right.

210
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:08,059
The Kaiju are learning
our defenses.

211
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:11,295
They're adapting.
Evolving.

212
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:14,198
And we're losing jaegers faster
than we can build them.

213
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,234
Lima.

214
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:18,169
Seattle.

215
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:20,571
Vladivostok.

216
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:23,808
Category 4 Kaijus are now
coming through the breach.

217
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,810
I think even you can see,
marshal,

218
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:28,212
This is no longer
a sound strategy.

219
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:30,515
The frequency of the attacks
has increased.

220
00:17:30,517 --> 00:17:32,750
The jaegers are not
the most viable

221
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:34,218
Line of defense anymore.

222
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,054
I am aware.

223
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:40,491
Those are my rangers that die
every time a Jaeger falls,

224
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:42,260
Which is why I'm asking you
for one last chance..

225
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:44,262
Excuse me, marshal.
Excuse me!

226
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:47,231
..one final assault with
everything we've got. Listen to me.

227
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,233
The Jaeger program
is dead, marshal.

228
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,235
On the other hand,

229
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,237
The coastal wall program
is a promising option.

230
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,739
The world appreciates

231
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:56,541
All that you and your men
have done,

232
00:17:56,543 --> 00:17:58,709
But it's over.
We will authorize you

233
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:00,344
To take all remaining jaegers

234
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:02,613
Hong Kong.

235
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:06,417
We're prepared to fund you
for the next eight months

236
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,186
While the coastal wall
is completed.

237
00:18:08,188 --> 00:18:10,388
After that, you will receive
no further support.

238
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:13,724
You have your answer, marshal.

239
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:16,594
So that's it?

240
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:20,298
It's over?

241
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,367
Suits and ties, flashy smiles.

242
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:24,702
That's all they are, stacker.

243
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:31,175
We don't need 'em.

244
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:54,165
Ration cards, guys!

245
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:55,900
Come on, come on!

246
00:18:55,902 --> 00:18:57,902
Let's go!

247
00:18:57,904 --> 00:19:01,105
Now, I got good news
and I got bad news, fellas.

248
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:02,940
Which one you wanna hear first?

249
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:04,142
Bad news!

250
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:09,247
Three guys died yesterday
working the top of the wall.

251
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:13,151
What's the good news?

252
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:16,187
The good news is,
I got three new job openings.

253
00:19:16,189 --> 00:19:18,489
Top of the wall.

254
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:21,159
Okay, who wants to work?
Who wants to eat?

255
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:23,661
Come on!

256
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:07,071
I am here in Sydney,
where earlier today,

257
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:09,974
Yet another Kaiju attack
took place.

258
00:20:09,976 --> 00:20:12,743
The Kaiju,
an enormous category 4,

259
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:16,747
Broke through the coastal wall
in less than an hour.

260
00:20:19,586 --> 00:20:21,219
The wall of life
had been deemed unbreachable

261
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:22,853
By its builders.

262
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:25,056
Why the hell are we even
buildin' this thing?

263
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:26,724
The creature entered the city
through Sydney cove.

264
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,726
That.. That thing

265
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,928
Went through the wall like it was nothing.
Ironically, it was

266
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,364
The recently decommissioned
Jaeger, striker eureka,

267
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:34,865
Piloted by Herc
and chuck Hansen,

268
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:38,135
That finally took
the beast down.

269
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,460
Look, they decommissioned

270
00:21:02,462 --> 00:21:04,395
The Jaeger program
because of mediocre pilots.

271
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:06,530
It's that simple.

272
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:08,599
That's striker eureka's
tenth kill to date.

273
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,034
It's a new record.

274
00:21:10,036 --> 00:21:12,069
And you're still
going to Hong Kong,

275
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:13,938
Even at a time like this?

276
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,240
Well, orders are orders.
What else am I supposed to do?

277
00:21:16,242 --> 00:21:18,142
Come on, mate.

278
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:24,982
Chuck Hansen, one of
the pilots of striker eureka,

279
00:21:24,984 --> 00:21:28,052
The Jaeger that took down
the Kaiju.

280
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,295
Mr. Becket.

281
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:40,131
Marshal.
Looking sharp.

282
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:42,133
Long time.

283
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:44,302
Five years, four months.

284
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:46,671
Can I have a word?

285
00:21:46,673 --> 00:21:49,273
Attention,
all zone three welders.

286
00:21:49,275 --> 00:21:51,909
Step into my office, marshal.

287
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:54,111
Took me a while to find you.

288
00:21:54,113 --> 00:21:56,113
Anchorage, Sheldon point,
Nome..

289
00:21:56,115 --> 00:21:58,516
Yeah, a man in my position
travels with the wall,

290
00:21:58,518 --> 00:22:00,751
Chasing shifts
to make a livin'.

291
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:03,120
What do you want?

292
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:06,123
I've spent the last six months

293
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:09,527
Activating everything
I can get my hands on.

294
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:12,997
There's an old Jaeger,
a mark 3.

295
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:15,433
You may know it.
It needs a pilot.

296
00:22:15,435 --> 00:22:17,535
I'm guessing I wasn't
your first choice.

297
00:22:17,537 --> 00:22:20,171
You a my first choice.

298
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:23,674
All the other mark 3 pilots
are dead.

299
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:31,949
Look..

300
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:35,152
I can't have anyone else
in my head again.

301
00:22:35,154 --> 00:22:38,389
I'm done.

302
00:22:38,391 --> 00:22:41,392
I was still connected
to my brother when he died.

303
00:22:41,394 --> 00:22:45,029
I can't go through that again,
man, I'm sorry.

304
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:47,298
Haven't you heard,
Mr. Becket?

305
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,635
The world is coming to an end.

306
00:22:51,637 --> 00:22:55,039
So where would you rather die?!

307
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:58,242
Here, or in a Jaeger?!

308
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:09,780
Mr. Becket,
this is Mako Mori.

309
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,382
One of our brightest.

310
00:24:11,384 --> 00:24:14,952
Also in charge of the mark 3
restoration program.

311
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:18,589
She personally handpicked
your copilot candidates.

312
00:24:22,261 --> 00:24:24,128
Hey.

313
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:40,144
At ease.

314
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:42,079
We will tour the facility first

315
00:24:42,081 --> 00:24:45,616
And then miss Mori will show you
to your Jaeger, Mr. Becket.

316
00:24:45,618 --> 00:24:47,318
Wait for us, please!
Hold the door, please!

317
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,186
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

318
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,191
Stay back! Kaiju specimens
are extremely rare,

319
00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:55,659
So look
but don't touch, please.

320
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:58,195
Mr. Becket,
this is our research team.

321
00:24:58,197 --> 00:25:00,464
Dr. Gottlieb
and dr. Geiszler.

322
00:25:00,466 --> 00:25:01,866
Oh, no, call me newt.

323
00:25:01,868 --> 00:25:04,768
Only my mother calls me doctor.

324
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:07,037
Hermann, these are human beings.
Why don't you say hello?

325
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,639
I have asked you not to refer to
me by my first name around others.

326
00:25:08,641 --> 00:25:10,508
I am a doctor with over 10 years
decorated experience..

327
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:11,876
Oh, no, yes.
I have ten.. 10 years of experience, man.

328
00:25:11,878 --> 00:25:13,711
I'm very sorry.

329
00:25:13,713 --> 00:25:17,281
Oh, please.
Who is that, Yamarashi?

330
00:25:17,283 --> 00:25:20,184
Oh, this little Kaiju?
Yeah, you got a good eye.

331
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:23,354
My brother and I
took him down in 2017.

332
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:26,223
You know he was one of
the biggest category 3s ever?

333
00:25:26,225 --> 00:25:28,092
He was 2,500 tons of awesome.

334
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:34,465
Or awful. You know,
whatever you wanna call it.

335
00:25:34,467 --> 00:25:35,733
Yes, please excuse him.

336
00:25:35,735 --> 00:25:37,468
He's a Kaiju groupie.
He loves..

337
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:39,069
Shut up, Hermann,
I don't love them, okay?

338
00:25:39,071 --> 00:25:40,538
I study them.

339
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,306
And unlike most people,

340
00:25:42,308 --> 00:25:45,509
I wanna see one alive
and up close one day.

341
00:25:45,511 --> 00:25:47,878
Trust me, you don't want to.

342
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:52,883
So that's your
research division?

343
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:54,852
Things have changed.

344
00:25:56,989 --> 00:26:00,658
We're not an army anymore,
Mr. Becket.

345
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,693
We're the resistance.

346
00:26:02,695 --> 00:26:05,296
Welcome to the shatterdome.

347
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:25,883
War clock.

348
00:26:25,885 --> 00:26:28,085
We reset it
after every Kaiju attack.

349
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:29,420
Keeps everyone focused.

350
00:26:29,422 --> 00:26:31,789
The frequency of attacks
is accelerating.

351
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:33,624
How long till the next reset?

352
00:26:33,626 --> 00:26:36,026
A week, if we're lucky.

353
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:38,128
My experts believe there'll be
a Kaiju attack

354
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:41,065
Even before that.

355
00:26:41,067 --> 00:26:43,400
This complex used to
lodge 30 jaegers

356
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:45,469
In five bays
just like this one.

357
00:26:45,471 --> 00:26:49,239
Now we only have
four jaegers left.

358
00:26:49,241 --> 00:26:51,208
I didn't know it was this bad.

359
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:52,543
It is that bad.

360
00:26:52,545 --> 00:26:54,445
Crimson typhoon, china.

361
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:55,813
One of the greatest.

362
00:26:55,815 --> 00:26:57,414
Assembled in Changzhou.

363
00:26:57,416 --> 00:26:59,583
Full titanium core, no alloys.

364
00:26:59,585 --> 00:27:02,953
Fifty diesel engines
per muscle strand.

365
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:04,488
Deadly, precise fighter.

366
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:06,056
She's piloted
by the wei tang brothers.

367
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:07,925
Triplets.

368
00:27:07,927 --> 00:27:09,627
Local lads.

369
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:12,730
They've successfully defended
Hong Kong port seven times.

370
00:27:12,732 --> 00:27:14,932
They use
the thundercloud formation.

371
00:27:14,934 --> 00:27:16,900
Oh, yeah.
TripleArm technique.

372
00:27:16,902 --> 00:27:18,035
Very effective.

373
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:24,908
That tank, last of the t90s.

374
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:27,144
Cherno alpha.
First generation mark 1.

375
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:29,780
The heaviest and oldest Jaeger
in the service.

376
00:27:29,782 --> 00:27:33,017
But make no mistake, Mr. Becket,
it's a brutal war machine.

377
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:34,518
And those two,

378
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,487
Sasha and Alexis Kaidanovksy.

379
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:37,921
Yeah, I've heard of 'em.

380
00:27:37,923 --> 00:27:39,957
Perimeter patrol,
Siberian wall.

381
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:42,693
On thei watch it stayed
unbreached for six years.

382
00:27:42,695 --> 00:27:45,763
Six years.

383
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:01,779
Herc! Chuck!

384
00:28:01,781 --> 00:28:04,715
Gentlemen,
welcome to Hong Kong!

385
00:28:04,717 --> 00:28:06,984
Wait here.

386
00:28:06,986 --> 00:28:09,019
Max!
Come here!

387
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:11,188
Remember me?

388
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,390
Don't drool all over miss Mori.
Hi.

389
00:28:13,392 --> 00:28:15,159
Sees a pretty girl
and he gets all wound up.

390
00:28:15,161 --> 00:28:16,894
Raleigh,
this is Hercules Hansen,

391
00:28:16,896 --> 00:28:18,562
An old friend
from the mark 1 glory days.

392
00:28:18,564 --> 00:28:20,297
I know you, mate.
We rode together before.

393
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:22,666
We did, sir. Six years ago.
My brother and I.

394
00:28:22,668 --> 00:28:24,868
It was a three Jaeger team drop.
That's right. Manila.

395
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,203
Sorry about your brother.

396
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:27,871
Thank you, sir.

397
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:31,208
Herc and his son chuck'll
be runnin' point

398
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,543
Usin' striker eureka.

399
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:34,078
Fastest Jaeger in the world.

400
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,746
First and last of the mark 5s.

401
00:28:35,748 --> 00:28:38,582
Australia decommissioned it
a day before the Sydney attack.

402
00:28:38,584 --> 00:28:40,984
Yeah, it was lucky we were still around.
Yep.

403
00:28:40,986 --> 00:28:42,186
Now it's runnin' point for us.

404
00:28:42,188 --> 00:28:43,587
Wait, running point on what?

405
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:46,356
You haven't told me
what I'm doing here yet.

406
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:48,826
We're going for the breach,
Mr. Becket.

407
00:28:48,828 --> 00:28:50,861
We're gonna strap a 2,400 pound

408
00:28:50,863 --> 00:28:53,931
Thermonuclear warhead
to striker's back.

409
00:28:53,933 --> 00:28:57,067
Detonate an equivalent of
1.2 million tons of TNT,

410
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:59,837
And you and two other Jaegers'll
be runnin' defense for them.

411
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:01,405
Thought we were the resistance.

412
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:03,340
Where'd you get something
that big?

413
00:29:03,342 --> 00:29:05,509
See the Russians back there?

414
00:29:05,511 --> 00:29:07,244
They can get us anything.

415
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:08,245
Herc, shall we?

416
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:09,613
Good to have you back.

417
00:29:09,615 --> 00:29:10,848
Thank you, sir.

418
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:12,783
I'll show you
to your Jaeger now.

419
00:29:12,785 --> 00:29:15,419
Miss Mori,
will you give me a minute?

420
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:17,955
Marshal!

421
00:29:17,957 --> 00:29:20,257
Sir, we've hit
the breach before.

422
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:22,626
It doesn't work.
Nothing goes through.

423
00:29:22,628 --> 00:29:23,927
What's changed?

424
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:26,530
I've got a plan.
I need you ready.

425
00:29:26,532 --> 00:29:27,865
That's all.

426
00:29:27,867 --> 00:29:29,900
Let's go, Herc!

427
00:29:29,902 --> 00:29:31,869
Max, come here!

428
00:29:31,871 --> 00:29:36,874
Crew 17, please report
to the fifth floor.

429
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:39,977
Zero minus two.

430
00:29:39,979 --> 00:29:41,912
Xy minus two.

431
00:29:41,914 --> 00:29:43,280
REQ.

432
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:44,581
In the beginning,

433
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:46,150
The Kaiju attacks
were spaced by 24 weeks.

434
00:29:46,152 --> 00:29:49,153
Then twelve, then six,
then every two weeks.

435
00:29:49,155 --> 00:29:52,422
The last one in Sydney
was a week.

436
00:29:52,424 --> 00:29:55,959
In four days, we could be seeing
a Kaiju every eight hours

437
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:58,629
Until they are coming
every four minutes.

438
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:01,265
Marshal, we should witness
a double event

439
00:30:01,267 --> 00:30:02,666
Within seven days.

440
00:30:02,668 --> 00:30:04,134
Mr. Gottlieb,

441
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:06,236
I'm to drop a 2,400 pound
thermonuclear bomb.

442
00:30:06,238 --> 00:30:08,138
I need more than a prediction.

443
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,807
Well, uh,
that's a problem, then

444
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:11,508
Because see, he actually

445
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:13,677
Can't give you anything more
than a prediction.

446
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,813
No Kaiju entrails over my side
of the room.

447
00:30:15,815 --> 00:30:17,114
You know the rules.

448
00:30:17,116 --> 00:30:19,316
Every bloody day.
It's incessant.

449
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:21,151
Gents! On point.

450
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:22,619
Numbers do not lie.

451
00:30:22,621 --> 00:30:25,422
Politics and poetry,
promises, these are lies.

452
00:30:25,424 --> 00:30:28,992
Numbers are as close as we get
to the handwriting of god.

453
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:30,327
What?

454
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:32,029
Would you give me a moment?

455
00:30:32,031 --> 00:30:33,630
There will be a double event

456
00:30:33,632 --> 00:30:35,632
And then,
shortly thereafter, three.

457
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:36,867
And then four.

458
00:30:36,869 --> 00:30:38,502
And then we're dead.

459
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:40,304
I get it.
Alas.

460
00:30:40,306 --> 00:30:43,507
This is where
the good news comes.

461
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:48,111
Here is our universe,

462
00:30:48,113 --> 00:30:50,981
And here is theirs.

463
00:30:50,983 --> 00:30:53,050
And this is what we call
"the throat,"

464
00:30:53,052 --> 00:30:55,152
The passage between
the breach and us.

465
00:30:55,154 --> 00:30:57,054
We know that it's atomic
in nature.

466
00:30:57,056 --> 00:30:59,056
I predict that
the increased traffic

467
00:30:59,058 --> 00:31:01,558
Will force the breach
to stabilize

468
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,393
And remain open long enough

469
00:31:03,395 --> 00:31:06,630
To get the device through..

470
00:31:06,632 --> 00:31:08,966
And collapse its structure.

471
00:31:08,968 --> 00:31:11,034
Yeah, and that's where
I gotta chime in

472
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:13,403
Because, really,
I wouldn't wanna go in there

473
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:15,539
With that limited amount
of information.

474
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:17,674
Newton,
don't embarrass yourself.

475
00:31:17,676 --> 00:31:18,976
That's what I was tryin' to say.
Just hear me out for a second.

476
00:31:18,978 --> 00:31:20,544
Give me a second, please.

477
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:22,387
Why do we judge the Kaiju
on a category system?

478
00:31:24,183 --> 00:31:26,483
It's because each one is completely
different from the next, right?

479
00:31:26,485 --> 00:31:28,385
You see what I'm saying? One looks like
a shark and one looks like a fish..

480
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:30,554
Dr. Geiszler.
Just get to the point.

481
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:32,489
Yes.
The point is I don't think

482
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:34,024
They're all completely different
after all.

483
00:31:34,026 --> 00:31:35,893
These are some samples
I collected, all right?

484
00:31:35,895 --> 00:31:39,096
Now, this one here
was harvested in Sydney.

485
00:31:39,098 --> 00:31:41,698
And this was harvested
in manila.

486
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,933
6 years ago.

487
00:31:42,935 --> 00:31:46,770
They have the same exact DNA.

488
00:31:46,772 --> 00:31:50,007
They're clones.

489
00:31:50,009 --> 00:31:54,011
And this is the point where
he goes completely crazy.

490
00:31:54,013 --> 00:31:57,214
There's so much more to
the Kaiju than we understand.

491
00:31:57,216 --> 00:31:59,950
And we've really only
scratched the surface.

492
00:31:59,952 --> 00:32:02,252
This is a piece
of a Kaiju's brain.

493
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:04,421
Now, unfortunately,
it's damaged.

494
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:07,224
It's a little bit weak.
But it's still alive.

495
00:32:07,226 --> 00:32:08,792
Now, I think I can tap into it

496
00:32:08,794 --> 00:32:10,427
Using the same technology

497
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:12,729
That allows the two Jaeger
pilots to share a neural bridge.

498
00:32:12,731 --> 00:32:14,464
Now, think about that.

499
00:32:14,466 --> 00:32:16,600
I could tell you exactly

500
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:18,368
How to get through
the breach yourselves.

501
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:20,971
You're suggesting that we
initiate a drift with a Kaiju?

502
00:32:20,973 --> 00:32:23,140
No, no. No, no. Not like
a whole Kaiju, you know,

503
00:32:23,142 --> 00:32:24,908
Just a tiny piece of its brain.

504
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:27,077
The neural surge would be
too much for the human brain.

505
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:29,546
I agree.
I don't agree.

506
00:32:29,548 --> 00:32:32,549
Gottlieb, I'd like your data
on my desk asap.

507
00:32:32,551 --> 00:32:34,084
Sir.

508
00:32:34,086 --> 00:32:36,486
No, but his is so..
Thank you, newt.

509
00:32:36,488 --> 00:32:38,789
Guys, now, this is
the most amazing thing..

510
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:41,258
Newton, I know that you're
desperate to be right

511
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,961
So you've not wasted your life
being a Kaiju groupie,

512
00:32:43,963 --> 00:32:45,562
But it's not going to work.

513
00:32:45,564 --> 00:32:47,097
It is going to work, Hermann.

514
00:32:47,099 --> 00:32:48,799
And I'll tell you
something else.

515
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:49,900
Fortune favors the brave, dude.

516
00:32:49,902 --> 00:32:51,101
You heard them.

517
00:32:51,103 --> 00:32:52,836
They won't give you
the equipment

518
00:32:52,838 --> 00:32:55,005
And even if they did,
you'd kill yourself.

519
00:32:55,007 --> 00:32:59,176
Well, I'd be a rock star.

520
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:03,747
There she is.

521
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:09,319
Oh, my god.

522
00:33:10,589 --> 00:33:12,255
Look at her.

523
00:33:12,257 --> 00:33:17,327
Gipsy danger.

524
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:19,429
God, it's so beautiful.

525
00:33:19,431 --> 00:33:20,864
She looks like new.

526
00:33:20,866 --> 00:33:22,532
Better than new.

527
00:33:22,534 --> 00:33:25,168
She has a doubleCore
nuclear reactor.

528
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:28,472
She's one of a kind now.

529
00:33:28,474 --> 00:33:30,874
She always was.

530
00:33:30,876 --> 00:33:33,543
How do you like
your ride, Becket boy?

531
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:35,178
Solid iron hull, no alloys.

532
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,381
Forty engine blocks
per muscle strands.

533
00:33:37,383 --> 00:33:39,316
HyperTorque driver
for every limb

534
00:33:39,318 --> 00:33:41,151
And a new fluid synapse system.

535
00:33:41,153 --> 00:33:43,487
Come here.

536
00:33:43,489 --> 00:33:44,688
Tendo.

537
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,690
It's good to see you, buddy.

538
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:48,859
It's good
to see you too, brother.

539
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:50,394
It's just like old times.

540
00:33:52,831 --> 00:33:54,364
So what's your story?

541
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:55,899
Restoring old jaegers,

542
00:33:55,901 --> 00:33:58,335
Showing hasBeens
like me around.

543
00:33:58,337 --> 00:34:00,070
That can't be it.

544
00:34:00,072 --> 00:34:02,039
You a pilot?

545
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:04,074
No. No yet.

546
00:34:04,076 --> 00:34:07,144
But I wanna be one,
more than anything.

547
00:34:07,146 --> 00:34:09,679
What's your simulator score?

548
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:12,983
51 drops, 51 kills.

549
00:34:12,985 --> 00:34:14,351
Wow, that's amazing.

550
00:34:14,353 --> 00:34:16,820
But you're not one of
the candidates tomorrow?

551
00:34:16,822 --> 00:34:18,588
I am not.

552
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:21,191
The marshal has his reasons.

553
00:34:21,193 --> 00:34:23,326
Yeah, he always does,
doesn't he?

554
00:34:23,328 --> 00:34:26,496
But with 51 kills, I can't
imagine what they could be.

555
00:34:26,498 --> 00:34:29,599
I hope you approve
of my choices.

556
00:34:29,601 --> 00:34:34,104
I've studied your fighting
techniques and strategy.

557
00:34:34,106 --> 00:34:36,506
Even.. Alaska.

558
00:34:36,508 --> 00:34:39,576
And what do you think?

559
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:44,247
I think you're unpredictable.

560
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:46,349
You have a habit of deviating

561
00:34:46,351 --> 00:34:48,552
From standard
combat techniques.

562
00:34:48,554 --> 00:34:51,855
You take risks and injure
yourself and your crew.

563
00:34:51,857 --> 00:34:55,325
I don't think you're the right
man for this mission.

564
00:34:57,728 --> 00:34:59,963
Wow.

565
00:34:59,965 --> 00:35:02,365
Thank you for your honesty.

566
00:35:02,367 --> 00:35:03,934
You might be right.

567
00:35:03,936 --> 00:35:06,103
But one day,
when you're a pilot,

568
00:35:06,105 --> 00:35:11,341
You're gonna see that in combat
you make decisions.

569
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:16,680
And you have to live
with the consequences.

570
00:35:18,082 --> 00:35:20,517
That's what I'm trying to do.

571
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,618
The candidates are ready.

572
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,987
We will commence the trials
immediately, sir.

573
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:58,755
Good.
But there is one thing.

574
00:35:58,757 --> 00:36:01,024
We.. Mako,
we have talked about this.

575
00:36:01,026 --> 00:36:03,627
We will not be talking
about it again.

576
00:36:03,629 --> 00:36:05,095
Hm?

577
00:36:05,097 --> 00:36:06,930
You promised me.

578
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,035
Mako.

579
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,473
Vengeance is like
an open wound.

580
00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:20,143
You cannot take that level
of emotion into the drift.

581
00:36:20,145 --> 00:36:23,113
For my family, I need..

582
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:36,560
Raleigh.

583
00:36:36,562 --> 00:36:37,894
Come sit with us.

584
00:36:37,896 --> 00:36:39,663
Oh, I'm okay, thank you.

585
00:36:39,665 --> 00:36:43,166
Ah, come on, there's plenty
of room at our table.

586
00:36:43,168 --> 00:36:44,834
I haven't seen bread in awhile.

587
00:36:44,836 --> 00:36:46,703
Hong Kong.

588
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:48,838
Beauty of an open port,
no rationing.

589
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:53,076
We've got potatoes, peas,
sweet beans, decent meat loaf.

590
00:36:53,078 --> 00:36:54,744
Pass the potatoes.

591
00:36:54,746 --> 00:36:58,415
Raleigh, this is my son, chuck.
He's my copilot now.

592
00:36:58,417 --> 00:37:00,984
He's more my copilot,
right, dad?

593
00:37:00,986 --> 00:37:03,420
So you're the guy, eh?

594
00:37:03,422 --> 00:37:05,255
You're the guy who's gonna run
defense for me

595
00:37:05,257 --> 00:37:06,856
In that old rust bucket
of yours?

596
00:37:06,858 --> 00:37:09,326
That's the plan.
Good.

597
00:37:09,328 --> 00:37:11,761
So when was the last time
you jockeyed, ray?

598
00:37:11,763 --> 00:37:15,165
About five years ago.

599
00:37:15,167 --> 00:37:17,000
What have you been doin'
for five years?

600
00:37:17,002 --> 00:37:18,735
Something pretty important,
I reckon.

601
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:21,071
I was in construction.

602
00:37:21,073 --> 00:37:23,373
Oh, wow, that's great.

603
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:24,674
I mean, that's really useful.

604
00:37:24,676 --> 00:37:26,109
Uh, you know,
we get into a fight,

605
00:37:26,111 --> 00:37:27,844
You can build our way
out of it, eh, ray?

606
00:37:27,846 --> 00:37:30,947
It's Raleigh.

607
00:37:30,949 --> 00:37:32,616
Whatever.

608
00:37:32,618 --> 00:37:35,585
Look, you're Pentecost's
bright idea.

609
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:37,687
My old man,
he seems to like you,

610
00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:41,091
But it's guys like you who
brought down the Jaeger program.

611
00:37:41,093 --> 00:37:43,560
To me, you're dead weight.
You slow me down,

612
00:37:43,562 --> 00:37:45,795
I'm gonna drop you
like a sack of Kaiju shit.

613
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,100
I'll see you around, Raleigh.

614
00:37:50,102 --> 00:37:51,368
Come, max.

615
00:37:52,738 --> 00:37:54,404
You can blame me for that one.

616
00:37:54,406 --> 00:37:55,905
I've raised him on my own.

617
00:37:55,907 --> 00:37:57,741
He's a smart kid,
but I never knew

618
00:37:57,743 --> 00:38:01,478
Whether to give him a hug
or a kick in the ass.

619
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,913
With respect, sir..

620
00:38:03,915 --> 00:38:07,851
I'm pretty sure
which one he needs.

621
00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:16,893
4 points to zero.

622
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:29,139
4 points to 1.

623
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:46,323
4 points to 2.

624
00:38:46,325 --> 00:38:48,191
Okay, what?

625
00:38:48,193 --> 00:38:49,959
You don't like 'em?

626
00:38:49,961 --> 00:38:52,195
I thought you selected
them personally.

627
00:38:52,197 --> 00:38:53,296
Excuse me?

628
00:38:53,298 --> 00:38:54,764
Every time a match ends

629
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:56,700
You make this little gesture,

630
00:38:56,702 --> 00:38:59,369
Like you're critical
of their performance.

631
00:38:59,371 --> 00:39:02,372
It's not their performance,
it's yours.

632
00:39:02,374 --> 00:39:04,174
Your gambit.

633
00:39:04,176 --> 00:39:05,642
You could have taken all of them
two moves earlier.

634
00:39:05,644 --> 00:39:07,944
You think so?

635
00:39:07,946 --> 00:39:09,045
I know so.

636
00:39:09,047 --> 00:39:10,980
Can we change this up?

637
00:39:10,982 --> 00:39:13,683
How 'bout we give her a shot?

638
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,051
Yeah!

639
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:16,519
No.

640
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:18,788
We stick to the cadet list
we have, ranger.

641
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:20,957
Only candidates
with drift compatibility..

642
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:22,525
Which I have, marshal.

643
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:24,194
Mako, this is not only about
a neural connection.

644
00:39:24,196 --> 00:39:26,830
It's also about
a physical compatibility.

645
00:39:26,832 --> 00:39:28,531
What's the matter, marshal?

646
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:30,814
Don't think your brightest can
cut it in the ring with me?

647
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:35,105
Go.

648
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:42,645
Four strikes marks a win.

649
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:50,987
Remember,
it's about compatibility.

650
00:39:50,989 --> 00:39:52,756
It's a dialogue, not a fight.

651
00:39:52,758 --> 00:39:54,891
But I'm not gonna dial down
my moves.

652
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:56,526
Okay.

653
00:39:56,528 --> 00:39:59,429
Then neither will I.

654
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:17,714
10.

655
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:21,618
11.

656
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:27,257
21.
Concentrate.

657
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:36,733
22.

658
00:40:36,735 --> 00:40:37,967
Better watch it.

659
00:40:49,448 --> 00:40:51,815
32.

660
00:40:51,817 --> 00:40:53,116
MoriSan.

661
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,675
Enough.

662
00:41:18,677 --> 00:41:22,078
I've seen what I need to see.

663
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,413
Me too.

664
00:41:23,415 --> 00:41:24,981
She's my copilot.

665
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:27,484
That's not going to work.

666
00:41:27,486 --> 00:41:28,918
Why not?

667
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,753
Because I said so,
Mr. Becket.

668
00:41:30,755 --> 00:41:32,622
I made my decision.

669
00:41:32,624 --> 00:41:34,257
Report to the shatterdome
in two hours

670
00:41:34,259 --> 00:41:35,925
And find out
who your copilot will be.

671
00:41:50,774 --> 00:41:53,343
Mako.

672
00:41:53,345 --> 00:41:55,478
What was all that about?

673
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:59,282
I mean, I'm not crazy.
You felt it, right?

674
00:41:59,284 --> 00:42:00,617
We are drift compatible.

675
00:42:00,619 --> 00:42:02,519
Thank you for standing up
for me.

676
00:42:02,521 --> 00:42:06,222
But there is nothing
to talk about.

677
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,595
That's my room.

678
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:16,499
Excuse me.

679
00:42:16,501 --> 00:42:18,635
I mean, come on. I thought
you wanted to be a pilot.

680
00:42:20,005 --> 00:42:24,007
Mako,
this is worth fighting for.

681
00:42:24,009 --> 00:42:26,543
We don't have to just obey him.

682
00:42:26,545 --> 00:42:32,015
It's not obedience,
Mr. Becket.

683
00:42:32,017 --> 00:42:35,418
It's respect.

684
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:38,721
Would you at least tell me
what his problem is?

685
00:42:59,443 --> 00:43:02,178
In the wake
of the Sydney incident,

686
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:04,681
Which showed
the ineffective nature

687
00:43:04,683 --> 00:43:06,282
Of the wall of life program,

688
00:43:06,284 --> 00:43:09,218
Many are questioning
the government's motives

689
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:12,855
And wondering why the Jaeger
program has been discontinued.

690
00:43:12,857 --> 00:43:15,091
Riots have erupted
along the coastlines

691
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:18,861
Of several pan pacific cities.

692
00:43:18,863 --> 00:43:22,398
We have now relocated
millions of civilians

693
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,969
And supplies 300 miles inland
to the safe zones.

694
00:43:25,971 --> 00:43:27,937
Safe zones?
For the rich and powerful?

695
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:29,205
What about the rest of us?

696
00:43:29,207 --> 00:43:30,440
Yeah, answer the question.

697
00:43:30,442 --> 00:43:32,208
I believe the wall of life

698
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:34,877
Is still our best option
at this time.

699
00:43:34,879 --> 00:43:36,713
And that's all I'm gonna say
on the matter.

700
00:43:36,715 --> 00:43:38,314
Than.. Thank you.

701
00:43:41,752 --> 00:43:45,288
Kaiju/human drift experiment,
take one.

702
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:49,659
The, uh.. The brain segment
is the frontal lobe.

703
00:43:49,661 --> 00:43:53,162
Um, chances are..

704
00:43:53,164 --> 00:43:55,732
The segment's far too damaged
to drift with.

705
00:43:57,102 --> 00:43:59,769
Hermann, if you're
listening to this,

706
00:43:59,771 --> 00:44:01,304
Well, I'm either alive

707
00:44:01,306 --> 00:44:04,340
And I've proven
what I've just done works..

708
00:44:04,342 --> 00:44:06,643
In which case, ha, I won.

709
00:44:06,645 --> 00:44:09,445
Or I'm dead and I'd like you to
know that it's all your fault.

710
00:44:09,447 --> 00:44:11,114
It really is, you know.

711
00:44:11,116 --> 00:44:14,584
You drove me to this.
In which case, ha, I also won.

712
00:44:14,586 --> 00:44:17,120
Sort of.

713
00:44:17,122 --> 00:44:19,288
I'm going in in three..

714
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:21,591
Two..

715
00:44:21,593 --> 00:44:23,192
One.

716
00:44:23,927 --> 00:44:25,762
Hah!

717
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:49,552
Newton.
Newton!

718
00:44:49,554 --> 00:44:52,088
What have you done?

719
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:02,732
Gipsy danger neural test

720
00:45:02,734 --> 00:45:06,069
Commencing in 20 minutes.

721
00:45:06,071 --> 00:45:14,071
Gipsy danger neural test commencing
in 20 minutes.

722
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:26,756
Mm.
May I come in, Mako?

723
00:45:29,526 --> 00:45:32,762
All pilots report to mess hall.

724
00:45:32,764 --> 00:45:36,299
A long time ago,
I made you a promise.

725
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:47,677
These transmitters
are nonOperative.

726
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:49,679
I need them replaced.

727
00:45:55,452 --> 00:45:57,687
Setting harness for test mode.

728
00:45:57,689 --> 00:45:59,288
Waiting for second pilot.

729
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:09,732
Two pilots on board.

730
00:46:09,734 --> 00:46:12,635
I'm gonna take this side
if you don't mind.

731
00:46:12,637 --> 00:46:14,370
My left arm's kinda shot.

732
00:46:14,372 --> 00:46:15,638
Sure.

733
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:20,309
Are you gonna say anything?

734
00:46:20,311 --> 00:46:21,711
No point.

735
00:46:21,713 --> 00:46:25,548
In five minutes you're
gonna be inside my head.

736
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:27,316
You look good.

737
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:33,256
Pilots on board
and ready to connect.

738
00:46:33,258 --> 00:46:34,991
Prepare for neural handshake.

739
00:46:34,993 --> 00:46:37,527
Initiating neural handshake.

740
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:47,570
We're not in
the simulator now, Mako.

741
00:46:47,572 --> 00:46:50,173
Remember,
don't chase the rabbit.

742
00:46:50,175 --> 00:46:51,641
Random access
brain impulse triggers.

743
00:46:51,643 --> 00:46:53,075
Memories.

744
00:46:53,077 --> 00:46:54,343
Just let 'em flow,
don't latch on.

745
00:46:54,345 --> 00:46:56,312
Tune 'em out.
Stay in the drift.

746
00:46:56,314 --> 00:46:57,747
The drift is silence.

747
00:46:57,749 --> 00:47:02,018
Neural interface drift
initiated.

748
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:13,529
Look, Raleigh!
Over there!

749
00:47:13,531 --> 00:47:15,298
Mama!

750
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:18,668
Raleigh, listen to me!
Raleigh, listen to me!

751
00:47:23,208 --> 00:47:26,442
Right hemisphere calibrated.

752
00:47:26,444 --> 00:47:28,845
Left hemisphere calibrated.

753
00:47:30,614 --> 00:47:33,916
Ready to activate the Jaeger.

754
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:38,654
Okay, gipsy.
Lining up nicely.

755
00:47:38,656 --> 00:47:40,323
Better get ready.

756
00:47:40,325 --> 00:47:42,725
Pilot to Jaeger connection
complete.

757
00:47:42,727 --> 00:47:44,961
Marshal!
Marshal!

758
00:47:44,963 --> 00:47:46,195
I need to talk to you.

759
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:47,663
Not now, Mr. Gottlieb.

760
00:47:47,665 --> 00:47:48,998
I'm sure you can appreciate

761
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,399
How important
this moment is to me.

762
00:47:50,401 --> 00:47:52,368
Newton created a neural bridge

763
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:54,770
From garbage
and drifted with a Kaiju.

764
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:02,078
I found him prone,
and he's sort of dazed.

765
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:04,780
I don't exactly know
what to do.

766
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:10,019
I told you it would work.

767
00:48:10,021 --> 00:48:12,855
Yes, you did.
Well, what'd you see?

768
00:48:12,857 --> 00:48:15,157
You know, it was only
a fragment of a brain,

769
00:48:15,159 --> 00:48:17,727
So really all I was able to get
was, like, a series

770
00:48:17,729 --> 00:48:20,096
Of, uh, images or..
Or impressions. You know?

771
00:48:20,098 --> 00:48:22,231
Like when you blink your eyes
over and over and over again

772
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:23,699
All you really see
are, like, frames.

773
00:48:23,701 --> 00:48:24,901
Um, it was emotional in the..

774
00:48:24,903 --> 00:48:26,435
Newton, Newton.
Okay, Newton.

775
00:48:26,437 --> 00:48:29,672
It was so..
Newton, look at me.

776
00:48:29,674 --> 00:48:34,677
Now I want you to take your time
and be very specific.

777
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:37,747
Okay.

778
00:48:37,749 --> 00:48:39,248
Well, I don't feel like

779
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:41,017
They're just following some sort
of animalistic urge,

780
00:48:41,019 --> 00:48:42,451
You know, just hunting
and gathering.

781
00:48:42,453 --> 00:48:44,754
And I think they're attacking us
under orders.

782
00:48:44,756 --> 00:48:46,122
That's impossible.

783
00:48:46,124 --> 00:48:48,024
Is that impossible?
It's impossible.

784
00:48:48,026 --> 00:48:49,725
Because.. You know what?
Why don't you drift with a Kaiju?!

785
00:48:49,727 --> 00:48:51,427
You! Shut up!

786
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:52,795
Yes, sir.

787
00:48:52,797 --> 00:48:55,464
You, keep talking.

788
00:48:57,568 --> 00:49:02,071
These beings, these masters,
they're colonists.

789
00:49:02,073 --> 00:49:03,639
They overtake worlds.
They just..

790
00:49:03,641 --> 00:49:05,308
They just consume them
and then..

791
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:06,809
Then, they move on to the next.

792
00:49:06,811 --> 00:49:09,712
And they've been here before
in sort of a trial run.

793
00:49:09,714 --> 00:49:11,080
It was the dinosaurs.

794
00:49:11,082 --> 00:49:13,382
But the atmosphere
wasn't conducive, right?

795
00:49:13,384 --> 00:49:15,952
So they waited it out.
And they waited it out.

796
00:49:15,954 --> 00:49:17,887
And now, you know,
with ozone depletion,

797
00:49:17,889 --> 00:49:19,789
And carbon monoxide,
polluted waters..

798
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:21,991
Well, we've practically
terraformed it for them.

799
00:49:21,993 --> 00:49:24,293
'Cause now they're coming back,
and it's perfect.

800
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:26,295
See, the first wave,
that was just the hounds.

801
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:28,064
Categories 1 through 4,
it was nothing.

802
00:49:28,066 --> 00:49:29,899
Their sole purpose was to aim
for the populated areas

803
00:49:29,901 --> 00:49:31,267
And take out
the vermin.. Us!

804
00:49:31,269 --> 00:49:34,070
The second wave,
that is the exterminators.

805
00:49:34,072 --> 00:49:36,005
And they will finish the job.

806
00:49:36,007 --> 00:49:40,443
And then, the new tenants
will take possession.

807
00:49:40,445 --> 00:49:42,845
See, the reason that I found
the identical DNA

808
00:49:42,847 --> 00:49:45,815
In the two separate Kaiju organs
is because they are grown!

809
00:49:45,817 --> 00:49:47,416
Newton,
I need you to do it again.

810
00:49:47,418 --> 00:49:49,118
I need more information.

811
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:52,321
Wh..? I can't..
I can't do it again.

812
00:49:52,323 --> 00:49:54,957
II mean, not unless you have

813
00:49:54,959 --> 00:49:57,593
A fresh Kaiju brain
lying around.

814
00:49:57,595 --> 00:50:00,429
Do you?

815
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:08,804
Pretty impressive.

816
00:50:08,806 --> 00:50:11,040
Yeah, he remembers
how to turn it on.

817
00:50:11,042 --> 00:50:12,441
Oi, show some respect.

818
00:50:12,443 --> 00:50:13,943
When his brother died,

819
00:50:13,945 --> 00:50:16,479
He got the Jaeger back to shore
on his own.

820
00:50:16,481 --> 00:50:19,482
I've known one other pilot's
been able to do that.

821
00:50:19,484 --> 00:50:21,217
Now, there are
certain individuals

822
00:50:21,219 --> 00:50:23,019
Whose business
is the preservation

823
00:50:23,021 --> 00:50:24,787
And exploitation
of Kaiju remains.

824
00:50:24,789 --> 00:50:26,822
Yeah, right, black market
dealers, right?

825
00:50:26,824 --> 00:50:28,958
Yep. They're in and out
in a matter of hours.

826
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,660
They neutralize the acidic
factor of the blood,

827
00:50:31,662 --> 00:50:33,662
And they harvest
what they need.

828
00:50:33,664 --> 00:50:35,898
Now, this guy,
this is Hannibal Chau.

829
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:37,833
He runs the Kaiju black market
here in Asia.

830
00:50:37,835 --> 00:50:39,535
When our funding ran out,

831
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:41,203
We turned to him for help,
and in return,

832
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:42,405
I gave him exclusive rights

833
00:50:42,407 --> 00:50:43,739
To all Kaiju remains
in the region.

834
00:50:43,741 --> 00:50:44,974
You did that?

835
00:50:44,976 --> 00:50:46,842
Last days of war, gentlemen.

836
00:50:46,844 --> 00:50:49,045
Go to the corner of fong
and tull.

837
00:50:49,047 --> 00:50:51,647
Show them that card.
Look for that symbol.

838
00:50:51,649 --> 00:50:54,417
And a word to the wise,
do not trust him.

839
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:02,358
Calibration complete.

840
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:04,560
The hull!
It went through the hull!

841
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:06,362
Raleigh, listen to me!
You need..

842
00:51:08,766 --> 00:51:10,766
Pilot out of alignment.

843
00:51:10,768 --> 00:51:12,201
Both out of alignment.

844
00:51:12,203 --> 00:51:13,569
Both of them?

845
00:51:13,571 --> 00:51:16,038
Both of them.
Gipsy, gipsy!

846
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,540
You're out of alignment!

847
00:51:17,542 --> 00:51:18,742
You are both out of alignment.

848
00:51:18,743 --> 00:51:20,242
I'm okay.
Just let me control it.

849
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:22,078
Pilot two, out of alignment.

850
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,746
You're stabilizing.
But Mako is way out.

851
00:51:23,748 --> 00:51:25,514
Mako.
She's starting to chase the rabbit!

852
00:51:25,516 --> 00:51:27,883
Mako, don't get stuck
in a memory.

853
00:51:27,885 --> 00:51:30,719
Stay with me.
Stay in the now.

854
00:51:30,721 --> 00:51:32,388
Don't engage in a memory.

855
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:34,090
Mako.

856
00:51:34,092 --> 00:51:35,424
Mako!

857
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:37,026
Listen to me.

858
00:51:37,028 --> 00:51:38,994
Mako?

859
00:51:58,615 --> 00:51:59,115
Mama!

860
00:52:57,975 --> 00:52:59,942
Mako.

861
00:52:59,944 --> 00:53:03,345
This is just a memory.

862
00:53:03,347 --> 00:53:05,214
None of this is real.

863
00:53:28,572 --> 00:53:31,407
Weapons system engaged.

864
00:53:31,409 --> 00:53:34,210
Plasma cannon powering up.

865
00:53:34,212 --> 00:53:36,712
Oh, no.

866
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:50,993
Weapon system engaged!
Go to failSafe!

867
00:53:50,995 --> 00:53:52,361
FailSafe not responding.

868
00:53:52,363 --> 00:53:54,163
There's a problem
with the neural blocker!

869
00:53:54,165 --> 00:53:56,865
Her connection's
way too strong!

870
00:53:56,867 --> 00:53:58,234
Fully charged.
Mako!

871
00:53:58,236 --> 00:54:00,169
Mako, listen to me.

872
00:54:00,171 --> 00:54:04,306
This is just a memory.
None of it is real.

873
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:23,792
The power line!
The power line!

874
00:54:23,794 --> 00:54:26,362
Get the main power line!

875
00:54:45,582 --> 00:54:48,317
Take them offline!
Take them offline!

876
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:52,054
I just did.

877
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:02,398
Weapon system disengaged.

878
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:06,001
Mako!

879
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:13,942
Neural bridge exercise invalid.

880
00:55:16,347 --> 00:55:19,315
It's okay.
It's okay.

881
00:55:19,317 --> 00:55:22,518
Drift sequence terminated.

882
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:26,689
Would you like to try again?

883
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:58,921
Hello.

884
00:56:14,805 --> 00:56:17,072
PssPsst.

885
00:56:17,074 --> 00:56:20,809
You looking for
some Kaiju bone powder?

886
00:56:20,811 --> 00:56:22,311
SSome bone..?

887
00:56:22,313 --> 00:56:24,713
Some bone powder?

888
00:56:24,715 --> 00:56:26,815
Uh, no, why would I want that?

889
00:56:26,817 --> 00:56:30,719
Male potency.
I take it myself.

890
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:33,722
I see.
Uh, no, thank you.

891
00:56:33,724 --> 00:56:36,225
I'm looking for Hannibal Chau.

892
00:56:38,662 --> 00:56:39,962
Come.

893
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:44,767
Hannibal Chau, huh?

894
00:56:44,769 --> 00:56:46,635
Good luck.

895
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:56,378
Oh, my god!

896
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:58,447
Oh, my god,
this place is heaven!

897
00:56:58,449 --> 00:57:01,717
That's a lymph gland
from a category 2!

898
00:57:01,719 --> 00:57:03,085
And what are you
working on here?

899
00:57:03,087 --> 00:57:05,754
Is this a cuticle?
In mint condition?

900
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:08,357
Is that a Kaiju skin parasite?

901
00:57:08,359 --> 00:57:10,392
I've never seen them
alive before!

902
00:57:10,394 --> 00:57:13,028
TheyThey usually die
as soon as the Kaiju falls!

903
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:14,596
I thought you couldn't
keep them alive!

904
00:57:14,598 --> 00:57:17,132
You can if you soak
'em in ammonia.

905
00:57:21,237 --> 00:57:22,938
What do you want?

906
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:24,807
I'm looking for Hannibal Chau.

907
00:57:24,809 --> 00:57:26,208
I was told he was here.

908
00:57:28,579 --> 00:57:30,045
Who wants to know?

909
00:57:30,047 --> 00:57:33,148
I really can't say.

910
00:57:36,252 --> 00:57:37,986
Aah! Aah!

911
00:57:37,988 --> 00:57:39,488
Stacker Pentecost sent me!

912
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:42,424
Aah! Aah!

913
00:57:42,426 --> 00:57:44,827
Oh, that's great.
That's real great.

914
00:57:44,829 --> 00:57:47,496
So I take it
you're Hannibal Chau, right?

915
00:57:47,498 --> 00:57:48,764
You like the name?

916
00:57:48,766 --> 00:57:50,132
I took it from, uh..

917
00:57:50,134 --> 00:57:51,900
My favorite
historical character

918
00:57:51,902 --> 00:57:54,236
And my secondFavorite Szechuan
restaurant in Brooklyn.

919
00:57:54,238 --> 00:57:56,104
Now tell me what you want,

920
00:57:56,106 --> 00:58:00,075
Before I gut you like a pig
and feed you to the skin louse.

921
00:58:00,077 --> 00:58:01,910
She can't control her drift,

922
00:58:01,912 --> 00:58:03,512
And he went out of phase first!

923
00:58:03,514 --> 00:58:05,447
We all know what happened.

924
00:58:05,449 --> 00:58:07,850
We can't afford mistakes,
the Kaiju keep evolving,

925
00:58:07,852 --> 00:58:09,418
They keep kicking our asses!

926
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:11,119
He's a hasBeen, she's a rookie.

927
00:58:11,121 --> 00:58:13,422
I don't want them protecting
my bomb run, sir.

928
00:58:14,758 --> 00:58:18,327
You need to watch your tone,
Mr. Hansen.

929
00:58:18,329 --> 00:58:20,863
Hey, stay there.

930
00:58:20,865 --> 00:58:23,599
Give me a moment.

931
00:58:26,203 --> 00:58:28,670
You two are a goddamn disgrace.

932
00:58:28,672 --> 00:58:31,106
You're gonna get us all killed,

933
00:58:33,544 --> 00:58:35,777
I want to come back
from this mission

934
00:58:35,779 --> 00:58:38,647
'Cause I quite like my life.

935
00:58:38,649 --> 00:58:41,650
So why don't you just do us all
a favor and disappear?

936
00:58:41,652 --> 00:58:43,051
It's the only thing
you're good at.

937
00:58:43,053 --> 00:58:44,953
Stop! Now!

938
00:58:44,955 --> 00:58:46,822
Yeah, that's right.

939
00:58:46,824 --> 00:58:48,657
You just hold back
your little girlfriend.

940
00:58:48,659 --> 00:58:52,027
One of you bitches
needs a leash.

941
00:58:58,035 --> 00:59:01,203
Apologize to her.
Screw you.

942
00:59:08,244 --> 00:59:11,880
Aah!

943
00:59:13,684 --> 00:59:15,150
Aah!

944
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:21,456
I said apologize to her.

945
00:59:27,864 --> 00:59:30,065
Hey!
Hey! Enough!

946
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:31,567
What's going on?

947
00:59:31,569 --> 00:59:33,635
On your feet, both of you!

948
00:59:37,707 --> 00:59:41,510
Becket, Mori,
into my office, now.

949
00:59:41,512 --> 00:59:42,911
No, we aren't finished!
Hey! Hey! This is over!

950
00:59:42,913 --> 00:59:45,414
You're a ranger, for Chrissake.

951
00:59:45,416 --> 00:59:46,848
Why don't you start
acting like one?

952
00:59:51,287 --> 00:59:54,623
I went out of phase first.
It was my mistake.

953
00:59:54,625 --> 00:59:56,758
No.

954
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,294
It was my mistake.

955
01:00:01,564 --> 01:00:03,565
I should have never let you two
in the same machine.

956
01:00:03,567 --> 01:00:05,067
So, what?

957
01:00:05,069 --> 01:00:06,468
You're grounding us?

958
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:07,803
Not you.

959
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:19,314
Permission
to be dismissed, sir.

960
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:24,953
Permission granted, miss Mori.

961
01:00:28,825 --> 01:00:30,659
Mako.

962
01:00:33,262 --> 01:00:35,731
Sir, what are you doing?

963
01:00:35,733 --> 01:00:39,668
She is the strongest
candidate by far.

964
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:41,470
What other options do we have?

965
01:00:41,472 --> 01:00:43,005
Huh? Tell me!

966
01:00:43,007 --> 01:00:47,309
Do not let my calm demeanor
fool you, ranger!

967
01:00:47,311 --> 01:00:51,913
Now is not a good moment
for your insubordination!

968
01:00:51,915 --> 01:00:53,749
Mako is too inexperienced

969
01:00:53,751 --> 01:00:56,585
To rein in her memories
during combat.

970
01:00:56,587 --> 01:01:02,257
That's not why
you grounded her.

971
01:01:02,259 --> 01:01:05,927
I was in her memories.
I saw everything.

972
01:01:05,929 --> 01:01:08,263
I don't care
what you think you saw.

973
01:03:00,877 --> 01:03:03,044
I know what she means to you.

974
01:03:03,046 --> 01:03:04,646
I saw it! I..

975
01:03:04,648 --> 01:03:06,214
Hey! Hey!

976
01:03:06,216 --> 01:03:08,150
This conversation is over.

977
01:03:08,152 --> 01:03:09,718
Marshal.

978
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:12,821
Marshal, can we just talk
about this for one second?!

979
01:03:17,093 --> 01:03:19,127
You rescued her.

980
01:03:19,129 --> 01:03:20,796
You raised her.

981
01:03:20,798 --> 01:03:24,065
You're not protecting her now.

982
01:03:24,067 --> 01:03:25,901
You are holding her back.

983
01:03:25,903 --> 01:03:33,308
Don't you ever touch me again.

984
01:03:35,244 --> 01:03:37,846
Now, you have no idea
who the hell I am

985
01:03:37,848 --> 01:03:39,481
Or where I've come from,

986
01:03:39,483 --> 01:03:42,651
And I'm not about to tell you
my whole life story.

987
01:03:42,653 --> 01:03:45,587
All I need to be to you
and everybody in this dome

988
01:03:45,589 --> 01:03:47,589
Is a fixed point.

989
01:03:47,591 --> 01:03:50,091
The last man standing.

990
01:03:50,093 --> 01:03:53,695
I do not need your sympathy
or your admiration.

991
01:03:53,697 --> 01:03:57,966
All I need is your compliance
and your fighting skills.

992
01:03:57,968 --> 01:04:00,368
And if I can't get that,

993
01:04:00,370 --> 01:04:02,437
Then you can go back
to the wall

994
01:04:02,439 --> 01:04:04,306
That I found you crawling on.

995
01:04:04,308 --> 01:04:07,175
Do I make myself clear?

996
01:04:11,281 --> 01:04:14,516
Yes, sir.

997
01:04:16,485 --> 01:04:18,453
Good.

998
01:04:46,148 --> 01:04:48,149
I'm sorry.

999
01:04:48,151 --> 01:04:51,353
I should've warned you.

1000
01:04:51,355 --> 01:04:52,888
First drifts are rough.

1001
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:55,891
But you weren't just tapping
into my memories.

1002
01:04:55,893 --> 01:04:58,593
You were tapping
into my brother's too.

1003
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:05,333
When Yancy was taken,
we were still connected.

1004
01:05:05,335 --> 01:05:07,836
I felt his fear, his pain,

1005
01:05:07,838 --> 01:05:10,939
His helplessness, and then..

1006
01:05:10,941 --> 01:05:13,008
He was gone.

1007
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:15,944
I felt it.
I know.

1008
01:05:18,447 --> 01:05:21,449
You know, you live in someone
else's head for so long

1009
01:05:21,451 --> 01:05:24,085
The hardest part to deal with
is the silence.

1010
01:05:24,087 --> 01:05:27,856
To let someone else in,
to really connect,

1011
01:05:27,858 --> 01:05:30,859
You have to trust them.

1012
01:05:30,861 --> 01:05:35,597
And today the drift was strong.

1013
01:05:41,738 --> 01:05:43,471
Her heart.

1014
01:05:43,473 --> 01:05:46,975
When's the last time
you saw it?

1015
01:05:46,977 --> 01:05:49,844
Not in a long time.

1016
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:56,718
Movement in the breach.

1017
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:58,320
Double event.

1018
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:02,891
Two signatures.

1019
01:06:02,893 --> 01:06:07,629
Dilation indicator, category 4.

1020
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:18,940
Excuse me.

1021
01:06:18,942 --> 01:06:21,242
The breach
was exposed at 2300 hours.

1022
01:06:21,244 --> 01:06:23,244
We have two signatures,
both category 4s.

1023
01:06:23,246 --> 01:06:24,980
Otachi and leatherback.

1024
01:06:24,982 --> 01:06:26,581
They'll reach Hong Kong
within the hour.

1025
01:06:26,583 --> 01:06:28,850
Evacuate the city.
Shut down the bridges.

1026
01:06:28,852 --> 01:06:31,619
I want every single civilian
in a refuge right now.

1027
01:06:31,621 --> 01:06:33,688
Crimson typhoon, cherno alpha,

1028
01:06:33,690 --> 01:06:35,490
I want you to frontline
the harbor.

1029
01:06:35,492 --> 01:06:36,992
Stay on the miracle mile.

1030
01:06:36,994 --> 01:06:38,994
Striker,
I want you to stay back,

1031
01:06:38,996 --> 01:06:40,428
Look after the coastline.

1032
01:06:40,430 --> 01:06:42,030
We cannot afford to lose you,

1033
01:06:42,032 --> 01:06:44,032
So only engage
as a final option.

1034
01:06:44,034 --> 01:06:45,166
Yes, sir!

1035
01:06:45,168 --> 01:06:46,167
You two.

1036
01:06:46,169 --> 01:06:49,037
You stay put.

1037
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:50,338
Let's go!

1038
01:07:05,321 --> 01:07:10,058
Loccent, striker's got the ball
and we're on the roll.

1039
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:15,797
Loccent.. near positions
and awaiting your orders.

1040
01:07:15,799 --> 01:07:19,200
Remain in the miracle mile.
Engage at your discretion.

1041
01:07:19,202 --> 01:07:21,002
Guys, keep your eyes open.

1042
01:07:21,004 --> 01:07:23,171
These category 4s are
the biggest we've ever seen,

1043
01:07:23,173 --> 01:07:24,539
Both in size and weight.

1044
01:07:26,642 --> 01:07:28,376
Cherno alpha
reaching target zone.

1045
01:07:28,378 --> 01:07:30,111
Disengaging transport.

1046
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:52,667
Cherno alpha in position.
Miracle mile.

1047
01:07:52,669 --> 01:07:55,904
Cherno alpha
holding the coastline.

1048
01:07:55,906 --> 01:07:57,238
Beacon is on.

1049
01:08:04,714 --> 01:08:07,582
Look at 'em.

1050
01:08:07,584 --> 01:08:10,018
They believe the Kaiju
are sent from heaven.

1051
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:12,120
That the gods are expressing
their displeasure

1052
01:08:12,122 --> 01:08:13,421
With our behavior.

1053
01:08:13,423 --> 01:08:14,722
The silly bastards.

1054
01:08:14,724 --> 01:08:16,391
And what do you believe?

1055
01:08:16,393 --> 01:08:18,026
Well..

1056
01:08:18,028 --> 01:08:21,696
I believe that Kaiju bone powder
is 500 bucks a pound.

1057
01:08:21,698 --> 01:08:22,964
What do you want?

1058
01:08:22,966 --> 01:08:25,366
I need to access a Kaiju brain.

1059
01:08:25,368 --> 01:08:26,734
Completely intact.

1060
01:08:26,736 --> 01:08:27,735
No, no, no.

1061
01:08:27,737 --> 01:08:28,970
The skull plate is so dense

1062
01:08:28,972 --> 01:08:30,105
That by the time
you drill into it..

1063
01:08:30,107 --> 01:08:31,406
The brain's rotted away.

1064
01:08:31,408 --> 01:08:33,374
But I'm talking about
the secondary brain.

1065
01:08:33,376 --> 01:08:35,376
Now we both know
that the Kaiju are so large

1066
01:08:35,378 --> 01:08:37,745
They need two brains to move
around, like a dinosaur.

1067
01:08:37,747 --> 01:08:39,280
I want to get my hands on that.

1068
01:08:39,282 --> 01:08:41,049
Mm.

1069
01:08:41,051 --> 01:08:44,452
What the hell do you want
a secondary brain for, anyway?

1070
01:08:44,454 --> 01:08:46,988
I mean, every part
of the Kaiju sells.

1071
01:08:46,990 --> 01:08:48,423
Cartilage, spleen, liver.

1072
01:08:48,425 --> 01:08:49,657
Even the crap!

1073
01:08:49,659 --> 01:08:51,259
One cubic meter of crap

1074
01:08:51,261 --> 01:08:54,229
Has enough phosphorous in it
to fertilize a whole field!

1075
01:08:54,231 --> 01:08:56,131
But the brain..

1076
01:08:56,133 --> 01:08:57,932
Too much ammonia.

1077
01:08:57,934 --> 01:09:00,301
So what's the deal,
little fella?

1078
01:09:00,303 --> 01:09:01,736
Well, that's classified.

1079
01:09:01,738 --> 01:09:04,305
So I couldn't tell you.
Even if I wanted to.

1080
01:09:04,307 --> 01:09:06,107
Mm.

1081
01:09:06,109 --> 01:09:08,009
But it is pretty cool.

1082
01:09:08,011 --> 01:09:09,844
So I might tell you.

1083
01:09:09,846 --> 01:09:11,613
I'm gonna tell you.

1084
01:09:11,615 --> 01:09:15,183
I figured out how to drift
with a Kaiju.

1085
01:09:15,185 --> 01:09:17,652
Are you funnin' me, son?

1086
01:09:17,654 --> 01:09:20,188
It's fascinating
how their minds work.

1087
01:09:20,190 --> 01:09:22,924
Every single Kaiju,
his mind's connected.

1088
01:09:22,926 --> 01:09:25,693
The species has like a..
Like a hive mind.

1089
01:09:27,831 --> 01:09:30,498
Holy Jesus.

1090
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:32,700
You've gone and done it,
haven't you?

1091
01:09:32,702 --> 01:09:35,403
I did it a little bit, yeah.

1092
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:40,742
You goddamn moron.

1093
01:11:14,903 --> 01:11:17,538
Loccent! Typhoon and alpha
are in trouble.

1094
01:11:17,540 --> 01:11:18,973
We're movin' in!

1095
01:11:18,975 --> 01:11:20,942
You are to hold your ground.
Do not engage.

1096
01:11:20,944 --> 01:11:22,610
We need you to carry that bomb.

1097
01:11:22,612 --> 01:11:23,845
Do you copy?

1098
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:36,824
Jesus, we can't just sit here
and watch 'em die. Come on!

1099
01:11:36,826 --> 01:11:40,328
Ah, screw this.
Loccent, we're movin' in now!

1100
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:14,262
Cherno alpha,
we've been hit with some type of acid!

1101
01:12:14,264 --> 01:12:16,331
Come on!

1102
01:12:16,333 --> 01:12:18,299
Hull has been compromised.
We need backup immediately!

1103
01:12:18,301 --> 01:12:22,170
Just hold on, cherno!
We're on our way!

1104
01:12:54,403 --> 01:12:56,270
Our power move!
Yeah!

1105
01:13:20,829 --> 01:13:24,399
We just lost cherno, sir.

1106
01:13:47,890 --> 01:13:49,857
Engaging air missiles!

1107
01:14:16,786 --> 01:14:18,820
What's going on?
What happened?

1108
01:14:18,822 --> 01:14:21,389
The blast. It jumbled all the
jaegers' electrical circuits.

1109
01:14:21,391 --> 01:14:23,057
What the hell was that?

1110
01:14:23,059 --> 01:14:24,325
Loccent!
I've never seen that before.

1111
01:14:24,327 --> 01:14:26,394
Loccent!
They're adapting.

1112
01:14:26,396 --> 01:14:28,129
This isn't a defense mechanism,
it's a weapon!

1113
01:14:28,131 --> 01:14:29,630
Get me striker!

1114
01:14:29,632 --> 01:14:31,165
Nothing, sir.
The mark 5's digital's fried.

1115
01:14:31,167 --> 01:14:33,601
It'll take me two hours
to reroute the auxiliary.

1116
01:14:33,603 --> 01:14:35,336
All the jaegers,
they're digital!

1117
01:14:35,338 --> 01:14:36,604
Not all of them, marshal.

1118
01:14:36,606 --> 01:14:39,340
Gipsy's analog.
Nuclear.

1119
01:14:53,856 --> 01:14:55,923
We got two Kaijus.
We gotta get out.

1120
01:14:55,925 --> 01:14:58,793
Hang on a second. Excuse me.
WhWhat's going on?

1121
01:14:58,795 --> 01:15:00,127
There are two goddamn Kaiju

1122
01:15:00,129 --> 01:15:01,996
Headed straight
for Hong Kong city.

1123
01:15:01,998 --> 01:15:03,931
No, no, no. That's not possible.
There's never been two before.

1124
01:15:03,933 --> 01:15:05,466
Well, maybe that's 'cause

1125
01:15:05,468 --> 01:15:08,469
Nobody ever drifted with one
before, eh, genius?!

1126
01:15:08,471 --> 01:15:10,938
When Jaeger pilots drift,
it's a twoWay street.

1127
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:12,707
A bridge, right?
Of course. Yes!

1128
01:15:12,709 --> 01:15:13,975
It sets up a connection.

1129
01:15:13,977 --> 01:15:15,610
Both ways!

1130
01:15:15,612 --> 01:15:18,546
"A hive mentality," you said!

1131
01:15:18,548 --> 01:15:21,182
Maybe those Kaiju
are tryin' to find you.

1132
01:15:21,184 --> 01:15:23,050
What.. What're
we gonna do?

1133
01:15:23,052 --> 01:15:24,519
I'm gonna wait out
this shitstorm

1134
01:15:24,521 --> 01:15:26,020
In my own private Kaiju bunker.

1135
01:15:26,022 --> 01:15:28,489
But you are going
to a public refuge.

1136
01:15:28,491 --> 01:15:32,827
I tried it once.
Once.

1137
01:15:32,829 --> 01:15:34,228
Now get the hell outta here.

1138
01:16:09,766 --> 01:16:12,400
Excuse me!

1139
01:16:12,402 --> 01:16:12,902
Aah!

1140
01:16:26,448 --> 01:16:29,517
Move! Move!
I'm a doctor! I'm a doctor!

1141
01:16:31,086 --> 01:16:34,388
Okay, hold on.
Let me in.

1142
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:36,524
Okay, I'm a doctor.
Okay, let me in, I'm a doctor.

1143
01:16:36,526 --> 01:16:43,264
Please proceed immediately
to your antiKaiju refuge.

1144
01:17:01,050 --> 01:17:02,717
There's no emergency power.

1145
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:05,152
We gotta bail.
I'm gonna try somethin' else.

1146
01:17:05,154 --> 01:17:06,587
No!
Don't disengage!

1147
01:17:06,589 --> 01:17:09,890
Aah! My arm!

1148
01:17:09,892 --> 01:17:12,460
Hey! Come on!
Get on your feet, old man!

1149
01:17:12,462 --> 01:17:15,496
Don't call me that!

1150
01:17:20,836 --> 01:17:23,604
He's right outside.
We gotta get outta here now!

1151
01:17:23,606 --> 01:17:25,072
We're not goin' anywhere!

1152
01:17:25,074 --> 01:17:26,507
Now you and I
are the only thing

1153
01:17:26,509 --> 01:17:28,009
Standin' between
that ugly bastard

1154
01:17:28,011 --> 01:17:29,577
And a city of 2 million people.

1155
01:17:29,579 --> 01:17:30,778
Now we have a choice here.

1156
01:17:30,780 --> 01:17:31,812
We either sit and wait

1157
01:17:31,814 --> 01:17:34,148
Or we take these flare guns

1158
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:37,184
And do something really stupid.

1159
01:17:49,532 --> 01:17:51,465
How's your arm?
Ah, just give me the gun.

1160
01:17:51,467 --> 01:17:53,868
Hey, you!

1161
01:18:04,681 --> 01:18:06,280
I think we just pissed it off!

1162
01:18:30,405 --> 01:18:33,541
All right, Mako.
Get ready, this is for real!

1163
01:18:44,686 --> 01:18:46,754
Yeah!

1164
01:18:46,756 --> 01:18:48,789
Come on, gipsy!
Kick his ass!

1165
01:19:36,272 --> 01:19:40,708
Come on! Let's do this!
Together!

1166
01:19:58,994 --> 01:20:02,396
Elbow rocket!

1167
01:20:02,398 --> 01:20:03,631
Now!

1168
01:20:18,313 --> 01:20:20,981
Aah!

1169
01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:46,774
Hang on, Mako!

1170
01:21:04,726 --> 01:21:06,327
Plasma cannon, now!

1171
01:21:06,329 --> 01:21:08,796
Plasma cannon engaged.

1172
01:21:13,568 --> 01:21:17,538
Empty the clip!

1173
01:21:50,839 --> 01:21:52,573
Wait.

1174
01:21:54,776 --> 01:21:56,176
I think this guy's dead.

1175
01:21:56,178 --> 01:21:57,845
But let's check for a pulse.

1176
01:21:57,847 --> 01:21:59,280
Okay.

1177
01:22:08,390 --> 01:22:10,658
No pulse.

1178
01:22:39,588 --> 01:22:41,889
He stopped right above us.

1179
01:22:41,891 --> 01:22:43,657
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

1180
01:22:43,659 --> 01:22:47,261
This isn't a refuge. This is..
This is a buffet line!

1181
01:22:49,332 --> 01:22:53,233
He knows I'm here.

1182
01:22:53,235 --> 01:22:54,835
He knows I'm here!

1183
01:22:54,837 --> 01:22:56,337
He knows we're all here!

1184
01:22:56,339 --> 01:22:58,238
No, you don't understand,
he's trying to get me!

1185
01:22:58,240 --> 01:23:00,307
He knows I'm here
and he's trying to get me!

1186
01:23:00,309 --> 01:23:02,009
What was that?
What did you say?!

1187
01:23:02,011 --> 01:23:03,744
What was she saying?!

1188
01:23:03,746 --> 01:23:05,245
I gotta get out of here!
Let me out of here!

1189
01:23:05,247 --> 01:23:08,182
I got..
Ah, come on!

1190
01:23:08,184 --> 01:23:11,185
Those were expensive glasses.

1191
01:23:11,187 --> 01:23:12,786
This is the worst.

1192
01:24:25,327 --> 01:24:28,595
Torque engaged.

1193
01:25:21,583 --> 01:25:23,784
I can't pinpoint it.
It's movin' quick.

1194
01:25:23,786 --> 01:25:26,286
Keep your eyes open.

1195
01:25:27,889 --> 01:25:31,058
Choppers,
do you have a visual? Over.

1196
01:26:14,035 --> 01:26:15,435
Come on!

1197
01:26:38,793 --> 01:26:40,194
I'll hold it!

1198
01:26:40,196 --> 01:26:41,728
Vent the coolant
on the left flank!

1199
01:26:41,730 --> 01:26:43,130
Coolant venting.

1200
01:26:43,132 --> 01:26:45,032
Co2 purge.
Venting coolant.

1201
01:27:48,363 --> 01:27:50,764
Atmosphere loss in progress.

1202
01:27:50,766 --> 01:27:53,300
Temperature's droppin'!
We're losing oxygen!

1203
01:27:53,302 --> 01:27:54,768
Both plasma cannons are shot.

1204
01:27:54,770 --> 01:27:56,203
We're out of options, Mako.

1205
01:28:00,375 --> 01:28:02,709
Sword deployment.

1206
01:28:23,331 --> 01:28:26,566
Altitude actuation offBalance.

1207
01:28:26,568 --> 01:28:30,804
50,000 feet to ground contact.

1208
01:28:32,307 --> 01:28:35,342
Look, there!

1209
01:28:35,344 --> 01:28:38,478
Altitude loss critical.

1210
01:28:39,848 --> 01:28:41,214
40,000 feet.

1211
01:28:44,185 --> 01:28:45,585
Gipsy, listen to me!

1212
01:28:45,587 --> 01:28:47,321
Loosen all the shock absorbers,

1213
01:28:47,323 --> 01:28:49,589
Use your gyroscope as balance
and ball up!

1214
01:28:49,591 --> 01:28:51,491
It's your only chance!

1215
01:28:51,493 --> 01:28:54,928
20,000 feet.

1216
01:28:54,930 --> 01:28:56,697
Fuel purge!

1217
01:28:56,699 --> 01:28:58,398
Now!

1218
01:29:00,034 --> 01:29:02,336
Impact alert.

1219
01:29:02,338 --> 01:29:04,104
We're comin' in too fast.

1220
01:29:04,106 --> 01:29:07,407
We're comin' in too fast.
Brace for impact, ma..

1221
01:29:35,303 --> 01:29:37,904
Mako, talk to me.

1222
01:29:39,874 --> 01:29:42,175
Mako, you okay?

1223
01:29:42,177 --> 01:29:45,078
Yeah.

1224
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:46,346
You?

1225
01:30:00,595 --> 01:30:03,363
Go to dr. Geiszler now!
Yes, sir!

1226
01:30:03,365 --> 01:30:06,366
I want the two remaining jaegers
back to 100% functionality.

1227
01:30:06,368 --> 01:30:07,701
Yes, sir!

1228
01:30:07,703 --> 01:30:10,404
We're gonna harvest

1229
01:30:10,406 --> 01:30:12,672
The skin,
the talons and the wing.

1230
01:30:12,674 --> 01:30:14,908
Germans are gonna go nuts
for that stuff.

1231
01:30:14,910 --> 01:30:17,110
Let me see that map.

1232
01:30:18,713 --> 01:30:20,414
Here is where the Kaiju fell,

1233
01:30:20,416 --> 01:30:22,849
Here's where we concentrate
our efforts.

1234
01:30:22,851 --> 01:30:24,584
We'll get it, boss.
Right.

1235
01:30:24,586 --> 01:30:25,986
Hey!

1236
01:30:28,389 --> 01:30:31,291
Okay, guess who's back,
you oneEyed bitch?

1237
01:30:31,293 --> 01:30:34,094
And you owe me a Kaiju brain.

1238
01:30:45,273 --> 01:30:47,674
Raleigh!

1239
01:30:53,748 --> 01:30:56,116
My kid'd never admit it..

1240
01:30:56,118 --> 01:30:58,251
But he's grateful.

1241
01:30:58,253 --> 01:30:59,519
We both are.

1242
01:31:03,724 --> 01:31:06,426
Mr. Becket!

1243
01:31:06,428 --> 01:31:09,996
Miss Mori!

1244
01:31:09,998 --> 01:31:12,165
In all of my years fighting..

1245
01:31:12,167 --> 01:31:19,005
I've never seen anything
like that.

1246
01:31:19,007 --> 01:31:21,241
Well done.

1247
01:31:21,243 --> 01:31:23,310
Proud of you.

1248
01:31:23,312 --> 01:31:26,746
Proud of us all.

1249
01:31:26,748 --> 01:31:28,615
But..

1250
01:31:28,617 --> 01:31:35,021
As harsh as it sounds,
there is no time to celebrate.

1251
01:31:37,258 --> 01:31:40,293
We lost two crews.

1252
01:31:40,295 --> 01:31:43,597
No time to grieve.

1253
01:31:46,434 --> 01:31:48,602
Reset that clock.

1254
01:32:01,215 --> 01:32:02,916
Reset the clock.

1255
01:32:34,849 --> 01:32:36,917
I still can't believe
what you did to me.

1256
01:32:36,919 --> 01:32:38,485
I mean, I coulda been eaten.

1257
01:32:38,487 --> 01:32:40,320
Well, that was definitely
the plan.

1258
01:32:40,322 --> 01:32:42,722
Lucky for you, that didn't
become necessary, huh?

1259
01:32:42,724 --> 01:32:44,491
Okay. Thank you so much.
You're so kind.

1260
01:32:44,493 --> 01:32:46,159
I really appreciate
all of this.

1261
01:32:46,161 --> 01:32:48,395
But now do you mind tellin' me
exactly what is taking so long

1262
01:32:48,397 --> 01:32:49,930
For your workers
to get that brain?

1263
01:32:49,932 --> 01:32:52,032
Well, they pump the cavity
full of co2,

1264
01:32:52,034 --> 01:32:54,367
Just like in any other
laparoscopic surgery.

1265
01:32:54,369 --> 01:32:55,936
Okay, yes, obviously,

1266
01:32:55,938 --> 01:32:58,605
The co2's gonna delay
the acidic reaction, yes.

1267
01:32:58,607 --> 01:33:00,373
And it allows us to harvest.

1268
01:33:00,375 --> 01:33:03,176
But our boys need oxygen pumped
into their suits.

1269
01:33:03,178 --> 01:33:04,411
They move slow.

1270
01:33:04,413 --> 01:33:06,212
What's goin' on in there, boys?

1271
01:33:06,214 --> 01:33:08,281
We've reached..

1272
01:33:08,283 --> 01:33:09,916
The upper pelvic area.

1273
01:33:09,918 --> 01:33:13,119
Moving to the 25th vertebra.

1274
01:33:13,121 --> 01:33:14,788
Shit.

1275
01:33:14,790 --> 01:33:16,923
Even through the suit, boss,

1276
01:33:16,925 --> 01:33:20,160
It smells like dead catfish
in here.

1277
01:33:22,296 --> 01:33:25,231
Boss.

1278
01:33:25,233 --> 01:33:28,268
The secondary brain..

1279
01:33:28,270 --> 01:33:29,402
Is damage.
Oh.

1280
01:33:29,404 --> 01:33:30,737
It's ruin. Destroy.

1281
01:33:30,739 --> 01:33:32,372
Bitch!
How could they screw that up?!

1282
01:33:32,374 --> 01:33:33,607
Wait. Wait.

1283
01:33:33,609 --> 01:33:35,041
What was that?

1284
01:33:35,043 --> 01:33:36,710
Did he say "wait"?
Why wait?

1285
01:33:39,246 --> 01:33:40,714
Do you hear that?

1286
01:33:40,716 --> 01:33:42,916
It's like a heartbeat.

1287
01:33:42,918 --> 01:33:45,218
Oh, my god.

1288
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:47,420
Oh, my god, this can't be.
Hold on a second.

1289
01:33:47,422 --> 01:33:49,222
Hey!
Let me have that!

1290
01:33:49,224 --> 01:33:51,124
Shh, shh!
Listen, listen!

1291
01:33:51,126 --> 01:33:53,026
Listen to this.

1292
01:34:01,002 --> 01:34:03,503
It's pregnant.

1293
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:01,695
No, no!

1294
01:35:01,697 --> 01:35:03,363
Please.

1295
01:35:03,365 --> 01:35:06,499
No! No.

1296
01:35:20,549 --> 01:35:22,348
I knew it.

1297
01:35:22,350 --> 01:35:23,883
Aah!

1298
01:35:23,885 --> 01:35:25,351
Gone.

1299
01:35:25,353 --> 01:35:28,354
His lungs weren't fully formed.

1300
01:35:28,356 --> 01:35:31,758
Umbilical cord
tied around his neck.

1301
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:35,095
No way he could survive
outside the womb

1302
01:35:35,097 --> 01:35:37,030
For more than a minute.

1303
01:35:37,032 --> 01:35:39,065
One look, that's all I needed.

1304
01:35:39,067 --> 01:35:40,934
I knew he wouldn't make it.

1305
01:35:50,545 --> 01:35:51,678
Ugly little bastard.

1306
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:53,646
Anyway, I woulda..

1307
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:14,768
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

1308
01:36:27,982 --> 01:36:29,716
Huh.

1309
01:36:39,261 --> 01:36:41,928
How sick are you?

1310
01:36:41,930 --> 01:36:44,063
And why didn't you tell me?

1311
01:36:44,065 --> 01:36:46,900
Ah.

1312
01:36:46,902 --> 01:36:51,004
What's to tell?

1313
01:36:51,006 --> 01:36:53,406
You know, them mark 1s,

1314
01:36:53,408 --> 01:36:58,978
We scraped them bad boys
together in 14 months.

1315
01:36:58,980 --> 01:37:03,850
Last thing we were thinking
about was radiation shielding.

1316
01:37:03,852 --> 01:37:08,354
I ran nearly a dozen missions.

1317
01:37:08,356 --> 01:37:11,291
I stayed under
the medical radar for awhile

1318
01:37:11,293 --> 01:37:14,661
But the last time I jockeyed
was Tokyo.

1319
01:37:14,663 --> 01:37:18,164
I finished the fight solo,
but for three hours..

1320
01:37:18,166 --> 01:37:20,200
I burned.

1321
01:37:20,202 --> 01:37:23,136
They warned me if I ever stepped
foot into a Jaeger again,

1322
01:37:23,138 --> 01:37:24,571
The toll would be too much.

1323
01:37:27,174 --> 01:37:30,343
You and I are the only two
that ever ran solo combat.

1324
01:37:30,345 --> 01:37:33,046
That's why I brought you here.

1325
01:37:42,356 --> 01:37:44,457
What is it?
Sir, it's happening.

1326
01:37:44,459 --> 01:37:45,959
I just got two signatures

1327
01:37:45,961 --> 01:37:48,628
With unprecedented dilation,
40Meter spikes.

1328
01:37:48,630 --> 01:37:49,996
What category?

1329
01:37:49,998 --> 01:37:51,664
Checking the ratios,
category four.

1330
01:37:51,666 --> 01:37:53,333
Where're they headed?

1331
01:37:53,335 --> 01:37:55,201
That's the thing,
they're not headin' anywhere.

1332
01:37:55,203 --> 01:37:57,303
They're hovering
just above the breach.

1333
01:37:57,305 --> 01:37:59,372
It's.. It's like they're
protecting it or something.

1334
01:37:59,374 --> 01:38:01,841
All right, gipsy, striker,
on deck.

1335
01:38:01,843 --> 01:38:04,244
Sir, Herc cannot ride.
His arm..

1336
01:38:04,246 --> 01:38:06,045
You heard me.

1337
01:38:06,047 --> 01:38:08,348
Two signatures.

1338
01:38:08,350 --> 01:38:11,317
Two?! There are..

1339
01:38:11,319 --> 01:38:13,586
There are two Kaiju signatures
in the breach,

1340
01:38:13,588 --> 01:38:15,321
Not three like I predicted?!

1341
01:38:15,323 --> 01:38:17,824
Hermann! I haven't exactly had
a very good day, okay?!

1342
01:38:17,826 --> 01:38:19,592
I got about 5 minutes..

1343
01:38:19,594 --> 01:38:20,860
Should be three Kaijus.

1344
01:38:20,862 --> 01:38:22,562
..before brain death
occurs here!

1345
01:38:22,564 --> 01:38:25,064
I don't wanna spend it talking
about your theories!

1346
01:38:25,066 --> 01:38:26,666
This is all wrong!

1347
01:38:26,668 --> 01:38:29,002
There should be three Kaijus
coming through, not two!

1348
01:38:29,004 --> 01:38:30,503
There should be three
and there's two?

1349
01:38:30,505 --> 01:38:32,672
I'm sorry, it hurts to be wrong,
doesn't it, Hermann?

1350
01:38:32,674 --> 01:38:34,240
I am not wrong, but there is something
here that we don't understand.

1351
01:38:34,242 --> 01:38:36,042
Okay. Hermann, hopefully
we can argue about any mistakes

1352
01:38:36,044 --> 01:38:37,844
You made in your predictive
model in the future!

1353
01:38:37,846 --> 01:38:39,112
But in the meantime,

1354
01:38:39,114 --> 01:38:40,380
The neural interface
is way off the charts!

1355
01:38:40,382 --> 01:38:41,681
If you want to help,
help with that!

1356
01:38:41,683 --> 01:38:43,683
Newton, I am not wrong.

1357
01:38:43,685 --> 01:38:45,551
There is only one way
to make sure..

1358
01:38:45,553 --> 01:38:48,288
And that is to do this..

1359
01:38:48,290 --> 01:38:49,889
Together.

1360
01:38:49,891 --> 01:38:52,425
I'll go with you.

1361
01:38:52,427 --> 01:38:55,361
That's what
the Jaeger pilots do,

1362
01:38:55,363 --> 01:38:57,230
Share the neural load.

1363
01:38:57,232 --> 01:39:01,034
You're serious?
You.. You would do that for me?

1364
01:39:01,036 --> 01:39:03,636
Or you would do that with me?

1365
01:39:03,638 --> 01:39:07,307
Well, with worldwide destruction
a certain alternative..

1366
01:39:07,309 --> 01:39:09,042
Do I really have a choice?

1367
01:39:09,044 --> 01:39:12,145
"We're gonna own this bad boy!"

1368
01:39:12,147 --> 01:39:16,783
By Jove, we are going to own
this thing for sure!

1369
01:39:22,222 --> 01:39:25,625
Oi, Tendo.
Tendo!

1370
01:39:25,627 --> 01:39:26,960
You're not suited up.

1371
01:39:26,962 --> 01:39:28,728
Yeah, I'm aware of that, Elvis.

1372
01:39:28,730 --> 01:39:30,463
I need to know what's going on.

1373
01:39:30,465 --> 01:39:32,098
He said suit up, so suit up.

1374
01:39:32,100 --> 01:39:35,068
Tendo, I can't pilot striker
on my own, now, can I?!

1375
01:39:35,070 --> 01:39:37,503
Dad's hurt, so who's gonna
be my copilot?

1376
01:39:59,326 --> 01:40:03,162
I don't remember it
being so tight.

1377
01:40:05,599 --> 01:40:09,802
Getting back into that Jaeger
will kill you.

1378
01:40:09,804 --> 01:40:13,172
Not gettin' into one
would kill us all.

1379
01:40:13,174 --> 01:40:18,011
Listen, you are a brave girl.

1380
01:40:18,013 --> 01:40:22,115
I'm so lucky
to have seen you grow.

1381
01:40:22,117 --> 01:40:25,785
But if I'm going to do this..

1382
01:40:25,787 --> 01:40:30,223
I need you to protect me.

1383
01:40:33,060 --> 01:40:35,762
Can you do that?

1384
01:40:39,666 --> 01:40:41,300
Hey.

1385
01:40:44,138 --> 01:40:48,207
Everyone, listen up!

1386
01:40:54,715 --> 01:40:57,083
Today..

1387
01:40:57,085 --> 01:41:00,053
Today..

1388
01:41:00,055 --> 01:41:02,722
At the edge of our hope..

1389
01:41:04,925 --> 01:41:09,362
At the end of our time..

1390
01:41:09,364 --> 01:41:14,333
We have chosen not only
to believe in ourselves,

1391
01:41:14,335 --> 01:41:16,502
But in each other.

1392
01:41:16,504 --> 01:41:19,272
Today there's not a man
nor woman in here

1393
01:41:19,274 --> 01:41:20,873
That shall stand alone.

1394
01:41:20,875 --> 01:41:23,709
Not today.

1395
01:41:23,711 --> 01:41:27,947
Today we face the monsters
that are at our door

1396
01:41:27,949 --> 01:41:30,550
And bring the fight to them!

1397
01:41:30,552 --> 01:41:34,921
Today we are canceling
the apocalypse!

1398
01:41:49,904 --> 01:41:52,672
Go to the safety zone
right now.

1399
01:41:54,408 --> 01:41:55,908
Hey, marshal!

1400
01:41:55,910 --> 01:41:58,478
You know,
that was a great speech,

1401
01:41:58,480 --> 01:42:00,746
But how exactly are you and I

1402
01:42:00,748 --> 01:42:03,282
Supposed to match up in there?

1403
01:42:03,284 --> 01:42:05,952
I carry nothing into the drift.

1404
01:42:05,954 --> 01:42:08,488
No memories, no fear.
No rank.

1405
01:42:08,490 --> 01:42:09,789
And as for you..

1406
01:42:09,791 --> 01:42:12,058
Well, you're easy.

1407
01:42:12,060 --> 01:42:14,760
You're an egotistical jerk
with daddy issues.

1408
01:42:14,762 --> 01:42:16,996
A simple puzzle I solved
on day one.

1409
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,767
But you are your father's son..

1410
01:42:21,769 --> 01:42:23,803
So we'll drift just fine.

1411
01:42:23,805 --> 01:42:27,240
Works for me.

1412
01:42:41,622 --> 01:42:43,356
Hey, now.

1413
01:42:47,661 --> 01:42:52,165
When you drift with someone,

1414
01:42:52,167 --> 01:42:55,368
You feel like there's nothing
to talk about.

1415
01:42:55,370 --> 01:42:59,205
I just don't want to regret

1416
01:42:59,207 --> 01:43:01,541
All the things
that I never said out loud.

1417
01:43:01,543 --> 01:43:03,342
Don't.

1418
01:43:04,946 --> 01:43:07,280
You don't need to.

1419
01:43:10,384 --> 01:43:13,452
I know them all.

1420
01:43:13,454 --> 01:43:15,621
I always have.

1421
01:43:17,158 --> 01:43:19,492
Hey.
Hey, handsome.

1422
01:43:22,463 --> 01:43:25,131
Oh, I'm gonna miss you.

1423
01:43:31,205 --> 01:43:34,974
You look after him for me.

1424
01:43:34,976 --> 01:43:36,542
Stacker.

1425
01:43:38,712 --> 01:43:41,314
That's my son you got there.

1426
01:43:43,317 --> 01:43:45,818
My son.

1427
01:43:50,257 --> 01:43:54,994
You know, Mako, all those years
I spent livin' in the past,

1428
01:43:54,996 --> 01:43:58,564
I never really thought
about the future.

1429
01:43:58,566 --> 01:44:01,367
Until now.

1430
01:44:03,271 --> 01:44:07,306
I never did have
very good timing.

1431
01:44:25,092 --> 01:44:26,425
You ready for this?

1432
01:44:26,427 --> 01:44:27,793
Oh, yes, yes.

1433
01:44:27,795 --> 01:44:31,030
Initiating neural
handshake in 5..

1434
01:44:31,032 --> 01:44:35,434
4, 3, 2, 1.

1435
01:44:58,293 --> 01:45:00,393
Are you okay?

1436
01:45:00,395 --> 01:45:02,395
Yes, of course.

1437
01:45:02,397 --> 01:45:05,064
I'm completely fine.

1438
01:45:12,639 --> 01:45:14,473
The drift.
You saw it?

1439
01:45:14,475 --> 01:45:15,741
Yeah.
Did you?

1440
01:45:15,743 --> 01:45:17,510
Listen, we have to warn them.

1441
01:45:17,512 --> 01:45:20,813
The jaegers..
The breach.. The plan..

1442
01:45:20,815 --> 01:45:23,349
It's not going to work.

1443
01:45:23,351 --> 01:45:27,320
Disengaging transport.

1444
01:45:36,496 --> 01:45:38,497
Loccent, all ports sealed.

1445
01:45:38,499 --> 01:45:40,166
Ready to submerge.

1446
01:45:40,168 --> 01:45:41,928
All ports sealed.
Ready to submerge.

1447
01:45:48,775 --> 01:45:51,844
Both neural handshakes at 100%.

1448
01:45:51,846 --> 01:45:54,513
Neural handshake
confirmed, sir.

1449
01:45:54,515 --> 01:45:57,383
Two actives still in circle
formation in the Guam quadrant.

1450
01:45:57,385 --> 01:45:59,952
Scunner, Raiju.

1451
01:45:59,954 --> 01:46:02,188
Both category 4.
Roger that.

1452
01:46:02,190 --> 01:46:05,858
Half a mile to
the ocean cliff, we jump!

1453
01:46:05,860 --> 01:46:08,127
It's 3,000 meters
to the breach.

1454
01:46:08,129 --> 01:46:10,663
Half a mile?! I can't even see
a damn inch ahead!

1455
01:46:10,665 --> 01:46:13,566
How are we supposed
to deliver the bomb?

1456
01:46:15,535 --> 01:46:17,069
Visibility's zero.

1457
01:46:17,071 --> 01:46:18,571
Switching to instruments now.

1458
01:46:27,882 --> 01:46:29,715
Sir!

1459
01:46:29,717 --> 01:46:32,084
Gipsy, you have movement
on your right. Three o'clock!

1460
01:46:32,086 --> 01:46:33,419
Three o'clock!

1461
01:46:33,421 --> 01:46:35,221
100 feet radius, clear.

1462
01:46:35,223 --> 01:46:37,223
Right flank's clear.
I got nothing.

1463
01:46:37,225 --> 01:46:38,691
Left now!
And movin' fast!

1464
01:46:38,693 --> 01:46:40,159
Fastest Kaiju on record!

1465
01:46:44,030 --> 01:46:46,699
I don't see anything.
It's movin' too fast!

1466
01:46:46,701 --> 01:46:50,836
Eyes on the prize, gipsy.
600 meters from the drop.

1467
01:47:15,262 --> 01:47:18,664
400 meters and closing.

1468
01:47:22,569 --> 01:47:25,738
Bogeys are stopping.

1469
01:47:25,740 --> 01:47:27,907
Striker!
Bogeys are stopping.

1470
01:47:27,909 --> 01:47:30,142
One o'clock.

1471
01:47:30,144 --> 01:47:31,210
Marshal, what are you doing?!

1472
01:47:31,212 --> 01:47:32,378
They're stopping.

1473
01:47:32,380 --> 01:47:34,146
Why the hell
are they stopping?!

1474
01:47:34,148 --> 01:47:36,282
I don't give a damn, sir!
We're 300 meters from the jump!

1475
01:47:36,284 --> 01:47:38,150
Something's not right!
Striker, the bogeys aren't following.

1476
01:47:38,152 --> 01:47:39,985
Take the leap now!

1477
01:47:39,987 --> 01:47:42,588
Don't do it! Don't do it,
it's not gonna work!

1478
01:47:42,590 --> 01:47:44,223
Move, you fascist!

1479
01:47:44,225 --> 01:47:45,891
Blowing up the breach,
it's not gonna work!

1480
01:47:45,893 --> 01:47:47,226
What do you mean?
What's not gonna work?

1481
01:47:47,228 --> 01:47:48,994
Sir, just because
the breach is open

1482
01:47:48,996 --> 01:47:50,763
Does not mean you're gonna be
able to get a bomb through.

1483
01:47:50,765 --> 01:47:52,731
The breach
genetically reads the Kaiju

1484
01:47:52,733 --> 01:47:54,233
Like a barcode at the supermarket
and then lets them pass.

1485
01:47:54,235 --> 01:47:55,668
Okay, so you're gonna have
to fool the breach

1486
01:47:55,670 --> 01:47:56,936
Into thinking that you have
the same code!

1487
01:47:56,938 --> 01:47:59,572
And how are we supposed
to do that?

1488
01:47:59,574 --> 01:48:01,140
By making it think
you are a Kaiju.

1489
01:48:01,142 --> 01:48:02,608
You have to lock onto the Kaiju,
ride it into the breach.

1490
01:48:02,610 --> 01:48:03,976
The throat will then read

1491
01:48:03,978 --> 01:48:05,911
The Kaiju's genetic code
and let you pass.

1492
01:48:05,913 --> 01:48:08,414
If you don't do it, the bomb
will deflect off the breach

1493
01:48:08,416 --> 01:48:10,516
Like it always has
and the mission will fail.

1494
01:48:10,518 --> 01:48:12,751
All right, now that
you've heard all that,

1495
01:48:12,753 --> 01:48:14,420
Striker, take the leap!

1496
01:48:14,422 --> 01:48:16,789
Sir! I have a third signature
emerging from the breach!

1497
01:48:16,791 --> 01:48:18,624
Third signature
emerging from the breach.

1498
01:48:18,626 --> 01:48:20,092
It's a triple event.

1499
01:48:20,094 --> 01:48:21,427
Oh, god, I was right.

1500
01:48:21,429 --> 01:48:24,964
How big is it?
What category?

1501
01:48:24,966 --> 01:48:26,198
Category 5.

1502
01:48:26,200 --> 01:48:28,367
Striker,

1503
01:48:28,369 --> 01:48:30,202
It's a category 5.

1504
01:48:30,204 --> 01:48:32,204
The first ever.

1505
01:48:56,029 --> 01:48:57,696
Striker, we see him.

1506
01:48:57,698 --> 01:48:59,899
We're right behind you,
about 100 meters.

1507
01:48:59,901 --> 01:49:02,201
We're gonna come around
your three o'clock,

1508
01:49:02,203 --> 01:49:03,536
Try to flank him.

1509
01:49:03,538 --> 01:49:04,970
Standard twoTeam formation.

1510
01:49:04,972 --> 01:49:06,805
Just keep him busy
for a few mi..

1511
01:49:19,185 --> 01:49:21,153
Brace for impact!

1512
01:49:27,661 --> 01:49:29,295
Chain sword deployed.

1513
01:49:53,520 --> 01:49:57,523
Let's get this son of a bitch!

1514
01:50:17,310 --> 01:50:19,812
Gipsy, comin' up
on your 12 o'clock!

1515
01:50:19,814 --> 01:50:21,647
Full speed!

1516
01:50:21,649 --> 01:50:23,716
Get out of the way!

1517
01:50:43,069 --> 01:50:44,336
The release is jammed!

1518
01:50:44,338 --> 01:50:46,939
We can't deliver
the payload, sir!

1519
01:50:46,941 --> 01:50:49,274
We're still armed.

1520
01:50:49,276 --> 01:50:51,243
But the hull is compromised!

1521
01:50:51,245 --> 01:50:52,778
Half our systems
are offline, sir.

1522
01:50:52,780 --> 01:50:54,179
We need to override the..

1523
01:50:58,585 --> 01:50:59,818
Aah!

1524
01:51:41,628 --> 01:51:44,530
Both Kaijus converging
on striker fast!

1525
01:51:46,701 --> 01:51:51,136
Hang on, striker!
We're comin' to ya!

1526
01:51:51,138 --> 01:51:53,706
No! Gipsy!
Do not come to our aid!

1527
01:51:53,708 --> 01:51:55,174
Do you copy?
Hang on!

1528
01:51:55,176 --> 01:51:56,575
Stay as far back as you can!

1529
01:51:56,577 --> 01:51:58,977
We can still reach you.
We're comin' for you.

1530
01:51:58,979 --> 01:52:01,380
No, Raleigh, listen to me.

1531
01:52:01,382 --> 01:52:03,382
You know exactly
what you have to do!

1532
01:52:03,384 --> 01:52:04,750
Gipsy is nuclear!

1533
01:52:04,752 --> 01:52:06,585
Take her to the breach!

1534
01:52:06,587 --> 01:52:08,053
I hear you, sir.

1535
01:52:08,055 --> 01:52:09,722
Headin' for the breach.

1536
01:52:09,724 --> 01:52:12,157
Structural damage, 80%.
Now..

1537
01:52:12,159 --> 01:52:15,894
Mako. Listen.

1538
01:52:15,896 --> 01:52:19,765
You can finish this.

1539
01:52:19,767 --> 01:52:22,601
I'll always be here for you.

1540
01:52:22,603 --> 01:52:26,004
You can always find me
in the drift.

1541
01:52:32,613 --> 01:52:34,279
We're a walking
nuclear reactor.

1542
01:52:34,281 --> 01:52:36,415
We can destroy the breach.

1543
01:52:49,063 --> 01:52:51,897
What can we do, sir?

1544
01:52:51,899 --> 01:52:54,032
We can clear a path!

1545
01:52:54,034 --> 01:52:56,635
For the lady!

1546
01:52:56,637 --> 01:52:58,737
They're gonna detonate
the payload.

1547
01:53:01,542 --> 01:53:04,476
He said if you have the shot,
you take it!

1548
01:53:04,478 --> 01:53:07,880
So let's do this!

1549
01:53:07,882 --> 01:53:10,949
It was a pleasure, sir.

1550
01:53:36,576 --> 01:53:37,576
Sensei.

1551
01:53:37,578 --> 01:53:39,278
Aishitemasu.

1552
01:54:08,942 --> 01:54:10,709
All systems critical.

1553
01:54:10,711 --> 01:54:12,544
Fluid loss.

1554
01:54:12,546 --> 01:54:14,713
Systems are critical!

1555
01:54:14,715 --> 01:54:16,615
Fuel is leaking!

1556
01:54:16,617 --> 01:54:17,683
Our right leg's crippled!

1557
01:54:17,685 --> 01:54:19,151
Code red.

1558
01:54:19,153 --> 01:54:21,486
Let's finish this.
All systems critical.

1559
01:54:21,488 --> 01:54:23,622
What are they doing?

1560
01:54:23,624 --> 01:54:25,357
Finishing the mission.

1561
01:54:25,359 --> 01:54:27,659
Loccent.
We have the Kaiju carcass.

1562
01:54:27,661 --> 01:54:29,728
We're heading for the breach.

1563
01:54:32,532 --> 01:54:34,666
You guys better be right.

1564
01:54:34,668 --> 01:54:39,404
'Cause one way or another,
we're gettin' this thing done.

1565
01:54:50,683 --> 01:54:53,418
On my count, rear jets!

1566
01:54:53,420 --> 01:54:57,556
Three, two, one.

1567
01:54:57,558 --> 01:54:58,724
Now!

1568
01:55:07,333 --> 01:55:09,101
Hold on.

1569
01:55:21,514 --> 01:55:24,516
Mako's oxygen is down.
Half capacity!

1570
01:55:24,518 --> 01:55:25,550
Can you reroute it?

1571
01:55:25,552 --> 01:55:27,185
I'm tryin', sir.

1572
01:55:27,187 --> 01:55:28,954
Hold on, Mako.
Heat shaft purge.

1573
01:55:28,956 --> 01:55:32,791
I'm gonna burn
this son of a bitch.

1574
01:55:50,043 --> 01:55:51,209
They're in.

1575
01:55:51,211 --> 01:55:53,312
They're in!
It worked.

1576
01:56:06,726 --> 01:56:11,496
Oxygen main, left hemisphere,
critical levels.

1577
01:56:11,498 --> 01:56:17,102
Operating at 15% capacity.

1578
01:56:17,104 --> 01:56:19,237
10% capacity.

1579
01:56:19,239 --> 01:56:20,906
5% capacity.

1580
01:56:20,908 --> 01:56:24,309
He's givin' her his oxygen.

1581
01:56:24,311 --> 01:56:26,445
Right hemisphere oxygen..

1582
01:56:26,447 --> 01:56:27,913
It's okay now, Mako.

1583
01:56:27,915 --> 01:56:28,947
..Critical level.

1584
01:56:28,949 --> 01:56:30,349
We did it.

1585
01:56:30,351 --> 01:56:33,185
I can finish this alone.

1586
01:56:33,187 --> 01:56:35,687
All I have to do is fall.

1587
01:56:35,689 --> 01:56:38,490
Anyone can fall.

1588
01:56:38,492 --> 01:56:42,260
Raleigh, your oxygen
levels are critical now.

1589
01:56:42,262 --> 01:56:43,962
You don't have much time.

1590
01:56:43,964 --> 01:56:46,665
Start the core meltdown
and get out of there.

1591
01:56:46,667 --> 01:56:47,666
Do you hear me?

1592
01:56:47,668 --> 01:56:49,501
Get out of there now!

1593
01:56:56,943 --> 01:57:00,212
One pod is ejected.
No detonation, sir.

1594
01:57:00,214 --> 01:57:01,880
Loccent,
if you can still hear me,

1595
01:57:01,882 --> 01:57:05,150
I'm initiating
reactor override now.

1596
01:57:07,855 --> 01:57:09,654
Manual activation required.

1597
01:57:09,656 --> 01:57:11,490
What's goin' on?!
Trigger's offline!

1598
01:57:11,492 --> 01:57:12,691
He has to do it by hand.

1599
01:57:12,693 --> 01:57:13,892
He's out of time.

1600
01:57:13,894 --> 01:57:15,193
He has to selfDestruct now.

1601
01:57:17,063 --> 01:57:20,232
Manual activation required.

1602
01:57:31,210 --> 01:57:33,445
No!

1603
01:57:49,395 --> 01:57:52,697
Manual override initiated.

1604
01:57:52,699 --> 01:57:56,001
Core meltdown in Minus 60.

1605
01:57:56,003 --> 01:57:59,438
Reactor meltdown in 55 seconds.

1606
01:58:02,208 --> 01:58:04,076
50 seconds.

1607
01:58:35,442 --> 01:58:39,177
Evac pod engaged.

1608
01:58:45,485 --> 01:58:52,591
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

1609
01:58:52,593 --> 01:58:54,993
Reactor meltdown commence.

1610
01:59:00,933 --> 01:59:03,301
Direct hit!
The breach has collapsed!

1611
01:59:06,406 --> 01:59:08,006
To the choppers!

1612
01:59:08,008 --> 01:59:10,142
To the choppers now!

1613
01:59:26,526 --> 01:59:28,960
Visuals on first pod.

1614
01:59:28,962 --> 01:59:31,730
Tracking solid.
Vital signs are good.

1615
01:59:37,370 --> 01:59:39,838
Okay, where's the second pod?

1616
01:59:39,840 --> 01:59:43,008
I'm tracking it, but I'm
getting no vital signs.

1617
02:00:09,302 --> 02:00:11,803
I can't find his pulse.

1618
02:00:11,805 --> 02:00:13,305
I don't think he's breathing.

1619
02:00:13,307 --> 02:00:14,506
Can you read his pulse?

1620
02:00:14,508 --> 02:00:16,241
Does he have a pulse?
Raleigh?

1621
02:00:16,243 --> 02:00:17,642
Raleigh?
I don't know.

1622
02:00:17,644 --> 02:00:19,678
Mako, listen to me.

1623
02:00:19,680 --> 02:00:22,180
It could be the sensors
are not working.

1624
02:00:22,182 --> 02:00:23,715
We can't be sure.

1625
02:00:23,717 --> 02:00:24,883
No.

1626
02:00:24,885 --> 02:00:27,986
No. Don't go.

1627
02:00:27,988 --> 02:00:29,921
Mako.

1628
02:00:29,923 --> 02:00:31,856
No. Don't go.

1629
02:00:31,858 --> 02:00:34,392
Mako.

1630
02:00:36,896 --> 02:00:39,931
Don't go. Please.

1631
02:00:41,667 --> 02:00:44,369
You're squeezing me too tight.

1632
02:00:48,175 --> 02:00:52,777
I couldn't breathe.

1633
02:01:08,294 --> 02:01:10,462
This is
marshal Hercules Hansen.

1634
02:01:10,464 --> 02:01:14,032
The breach is sealed.

1635
02:01:14,034 --> 02:01:15,300
Stop the clock!

1636
02:01:42,628 --> 02:01:45,297
Mako, Raleigh.
We have your position.

1637
02:01:45,299 --> 02:01:48,500
The choppers are on their way.
Just hang on.

1638
02:01:51,571 --> 02:01:53,905
Are you okay?

1639
02:01:53,907 --> 02:01:57,108
Do you copy?

1640
02:01:57,110 --> 02:01:59,577
Uh, guys?

1641
02:05:17,109 --> 02:05:21,613
When the earth collides

1642
02:05:21,615 --> 02:05:27,151
two hearts, two souls remain

1643
02:05:27,153 --> 02:05:32,190
one love of humankind

1644
02:05:32,192 --> 02:05:34,459
in heaven's name

1645
02:05:34,461 --> 02:05:40,365
no time for fear or blame

1646
02:05:40,367 --> 02:05:44,202
inside, we are the same

1647
02:05:44,204 --> 02:05:46,804
we feel it all

1648
02:05:46,806 --> 02:05:50,408
we feel the rise
before the fall

1649
02:05:50,410 --> 02:05:52,911
there's no dividing us

1650
02:05:52,913 --> 02:05:55,179
we feel it all

1651
02:05:55,181 --> 02:05:56,414
we feel it

1652
02:05:56,416 --> 02:06:02,987
we feel it all

1653
02:06:02,989 --> 02:06:09,027
the rise and fall

1654
02:06:09,029 --> 02:06:11,696
we drift inside each other

1655
02:06:11,698 --> 02:06:15,199
all we have is one another

1656
02:06:15,201 --> 02:06:21,272
united, we can never fall

1657
02:06:21,274 --> 02:06:24,409
we feel it all

1658
02:06:24,411 --> 02:06:27,779
we feel the rise
before the fall

1659
02:06:27,781 --> 02:06:30,682
there's no dividing us

1660
02:06:30,684 --> 02:06:34,552
we feel it all,
we feel it all

1661
02:06:34,554 --> 02:06:36,554
we feel it all

1662
02:06:36,556 --> 02:06:40,391
we feel the rise
before the fall

1663
02:06:40,393 --> 02:06:43,194
there's no dividing us

1664
02:06:43,196 --> 02:06:46,130
we feel it all,
we feel it all

1665
02:06:46,132 --> 02:06:47,932
great scientist minds

1666
02:06:47,934 --> 02:06:50,468
militaries combine to form
the greatest weapons

1667
02:06:50,470 --> 02:06:52,203
to defend mankind

1668
02:06:52,205 --> 02:06:55,373
from the bottomless pit
is the apocalypse

1669
02:06:55,375 --> 02:06:58,610
Egypt, Okinawa,
they threaten the populous

1670
02:06:58,612 --> 02:07:01,479
nations of man must stand
this terror

1671
02:07:01,481 --> 02:07:04,882
two hearts ripped apart,
they come together

1672
02:07:04,884 --> 02:07:07,819
some bonds we enjoin,
they cannot be severed

1673
02:07:07,821 --> 02:07:11,222
whether creed or color,
we all need each other

1674
02:07:11,224 --> 02:07:14,325
and look beyond these borders
to see each other

1675
02:07:14,327 --> 02:07:17,328
the fate of the world
is upon our shoulders

1676
02:07:17,330 --> 02:07:19,631
a soldier tells
his father goodbye

1677
02:07:19,633 --> 02:07:21,165
you see the crowd mist

1678
02:07:21,167 --> 02:07:23,668
a gleam of hope
appears in his eye

1679
02:07:23,670 --> 02:07:26,437
^ no one knows for whom
the bell tolls ^

1680
02:07:26,439 --> 02:07:29,007
a strong mighty body,
100 tons of steel

1681
02:07:29,009 --> 02:07:30,742
Kaiju

1682
02:07:30,744 --> 02:07:33,244
facing the enemy
that stands before us

1683
02:07:33,246 --> 02:07:34,612
we feel it all

1684
02:07:34,614 --> 02:07:36,481
they trying to destroy us

1685
02:07:36,483 --> 02:07:39,517
we feel it all

1686
02:07:39,519 --> 02:07:42,920
we feel the rise
before the fall

1687
02:07:42,922 --> 02:07:45,790
there's no dividing us

1688
02:07:45,792 --> 02:07:49,794
we feel it all,
we feel it all

1689
02:07:49,796 --> 02:07:51,763
we feel it all

1690
02:07:51,765 --> 02:07:55,633
we feel the rise
before the fall

1691
02:07:55,635 --> 02:07:58,136
there's no dividing us

1692
02:07:58,138 --> 02:08:01,706
we feel it all,
we feel it all

1693
02:08:01,708 --> 02:08:04,275
we drift inside each other

1694
02:08:04,277 --> 02:08:07,845
all we have is one another

1695
02:08:07,847 --> 02:08:15,687
united, we can never fall
