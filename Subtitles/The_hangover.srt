It's there. It's built.

He was so committed.

I really thought he was really sweet.

...parked in the middle
of Las Vegas Boulevard.

There was also a note.

It says, uh, "Couldn't find a meter,
but here's 4 bucks."

You don't even see the bachelor party.

This is the afterparty villa set.

Basically a group of guys
will sit around...

1873

...talk about what it would look like.

1874
01:45:10,229 --> 01:45:12,185
Then we throw a bunch of suggestions
into a bucket.

Dancing-girl outfits.

A lot of it is based on past experience
amongst the different people.
