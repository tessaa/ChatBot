1
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,400
Get Charlie.

2
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,640
Dr. Holloway!

3
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,640
Charlie!

4
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:44,920
What?

5
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,400
Come quick!

6
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,080
- Did you date it?
- Thirty-five thousand...

7
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,200
...years. Maybe older.

8
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,280
You gotta be kidding me.

9
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,720
It's the same configuration.

10
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,600
I mean, it's gotta predate
the others by millennia.

11
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,960
I think they want us
to come and find them.

12
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,640
Yeah.

13
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,280
What happened to that man?

14
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,520
He died.

15
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,280
Why aren't you helping them?

16
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,160
They don't want my help.

17
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,760
Their God is different than ours.

18
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,400
Why did he die?

19
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,120
Because sooner or later, everyone does.

20
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,440
Like Mummy?

21
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,560
Like Mummy.

22
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,800
Where do they go?

23
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,280
Everyone has their own word.

24
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,640
Heaven.

25
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,120
Paradise.

26
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,040
Whatever it's called,
it's someplace beautiful.

27
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,800
How do you know it's beautiful?

28
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,240
That's what I choose to believe.

29
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,120
What do you believe, Ellie?

30
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,760
<i>Good morning, David.</i>

31
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,240
<i>Transmitting message.</i>

32
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,040
<i>No response.</i>

33
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,760
<i>Whilst this articulation...</i>

34
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,560
<i>...is attested in</i>
<i>the Indo-European descendants...</i>

35
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,520
<i>...as a purely paralinguistic form...</i>

36
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,640
<i>...it is phonemic in the ancestral form</i>
<i>dating back...</i>

37
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,680
<i>...five millennia or more.</i>

38
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,760
<i>Let's attempt Schleichefs fable.</i>

39
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,040
Repeal after me.

40
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,920
<i>Perfect.</i>

41
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,680
<i>- Mr. Lawrence?</i>
<i>- Yes?</i>

42
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,040
<i>- Flimsy, sir.</i>
<i>- Thank you.</i>

43
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,280
<i>You do that once loo often.</i>
<i>It's only ﬂesh and blood!</i>

44
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,400
<i>Michael George Hartley,</i>
<i>you're a philosopher.</i>

45
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,160
<i>And you're barmy.</i>

46
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,680
<i>- It damn well hurls!</i>
<i>- Certainly, it hurls.</i>

47
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,240
<i>Well, what's the trick, then?</i>

48
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,040
<i>The trick, William Potter,</i>
<i>is not minding that it hurls.</i>

49
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,640
The trick, William Potter...

50
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,760
...is not minding that it hurts.

51
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,920
The trick, William Potter...

52
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,880
...is not minding that it hurts.

53
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,560
<i>Attention:</i>

54
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,080
<i>Destination threshold.</i>

55
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,560
<i>Attention:</i>

56
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,600
<i>Destination threshold.</i>

57
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,440
<i>Attention: Destination threshold.</i>

58
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,200
Robe.

59
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,440
How long?

60
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,920
Two years, four months, 18 days...

61
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,200
...36 hours, 15 minutes.

62
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,720
Any casualties?

63
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,320
Casualties, ma':-am?

64
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,560
Has anyone died?

65
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,920
No, ma'am. Everyone is fine.

66
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,400
Well, then wake them up.

67
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,080
Try to relax, Dr. Shaw.

68
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,720
My name is David.

69
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,320
Your mind and body
are in a state of shock...

70
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,480
...as a result of the stasis.

71
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,560
It's all right. Perfectly normal.

72
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,440
Ellie.

73
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,040
We're here, baby.

74
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:31,960
There, there.

75
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,840
<i>Drink plenty of water.</i>
<i>Drink plenty of ﬂuids.</i>

76
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,680
<i>Hydration aids muscle mass.</i>

77
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,600
<i>All crew, consume shakes</i>
<i>with high caloric content.</i>

78
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,680
What the hell is that?

79
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,560
It's Christmas.

80
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,040
We need the holidays...

81
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,680
...to show time is still moving.

82
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,680
Mission briefing...

83
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,320
...is about to start, captain.

84
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,320
Might wanna make your way down.

85
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,800
Well, I haven't had any breakfast yet.

86
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,680
Is this seat taken?

87
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,200
Hi, I'm Millburn, Biology. Nice to meet you.

88
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,080
Okay.

89
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,560
Look, no offense, but...

90
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,080
...I've been asleep two years.

91
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,160
I ain't here to be your friend.

92
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,680
I'm here to make money.

93
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,080
You got that?

94
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,720
Okay.

95
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,680
I beta hundred credits
it's a terraforming survey.

96
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,720
No, if it's a survey, they would tell us.

97
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,080
It's a corporate run,
they're not telling us shit.

98
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,040
Come on.

99
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,040
- A hundred.
- All right, you're on.

100
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,840
You look nervous, El.

101
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,160
- I'll try to keep my feet on the ground.
- I know you will.

102
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,200
Good morning.

103
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,320
For those of you I hired personally...

104
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,320
...it's nice to see you again.

105
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,800
For the rest of you, I am Meredith Vickers.
It's my job to make sure you do yours.

106
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,800
Okay, then. On with the show.

107
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,800
<i>Weyland Corporation.</i>

108
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,960
<i>Building better worlds.</i>

109
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,720
Hello, friends.

110
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,320
My name is Peter Weyland.

111
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,960
I am your employer.

112
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:31,080
I am recording this, 22 June, 2091.
And if you're watching it...

113
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,920
...you have reached your destination.

114
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,440
And I am long dead.

115
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,960
May I rest in peace.

116
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,160
There's a man sitting with you today.
His name is David.

117
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,200
And he is the closest thing to a son
I will ever have.

118
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,160
Unfortunately, he is not human.

119
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,600
He will never grow old...

120
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,680
...and he will never die.

121
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,600
And yet he is unable to appreciate
these remarkable gifts...

122
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,960
...for that would require the one thing
that David will never have.

123
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,200
A soul.

124
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,840
I have spent my entire...

125
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,400
...lifetime contemplating the questions:

126
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,080
Where do we come from?

127
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,800
What is our purpose?

128
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,440
What happens when we die?

129
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,920
And I have found two people who convinced
me they're on the verge of answering them.

130
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,440
Drs. Holloway and Shaw,
if you would please stand.

131
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,600
As far as you're concerned,
they're in charge.

132
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,080
The Titan Prometheus wanted to give
mankind equal footing with the gods...

133
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,680
...and for that, he was cast from Olympus.

134
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,200
Well, my friends,
the time has finally come for his return.

135
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,680
Doctors, please.

136
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,720
The floor is yours.

137
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,800
Okay, wow.

138
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,320
All right.

139
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,200
I never had to follow a ghost before.

140
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,480
Okay, let me show you why you guys...

141
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,720
...are here.

142
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:14,880
These are images of archeological digs
from all over the Earth.

143
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,840
That's...

144
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:19,200
...Egyptian, Mayan, Sumerian, Babylonian.

145
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,160
That's Hawaiian there at the end,
then Mesopotamian.

146
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,240
Now, this one here
is our most recent discovery.

147
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,240
It's a 35,000-year-old cave painting
from the Isle of Skye in Scotland.

148
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,600
These are ancient civilizations.
They were separated by centuries.

149
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,680
They shared no contact with one another,
and yet...

150
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,440
The same pictogram...

151
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,040
...showing men worshiping giant beings,
pointing to the stars...

152
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,120
...was discovered
at every last one of them.

153
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,160
And the only galactic system
that matched...

154
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,600
...was so far from Earth
that there's no way...

155
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:58,680
...that these primitive, ancient civilizations
could have possibly known about it.

156
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,280
But it just so happens...

157
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,200
...that that system...

158
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,680
...has a sun...

159
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,040
...a lot like ours.

160
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:13,200
And, based on our long-range scans,
there seemed to be a planet.

161
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,760
Just one planet with a moon...

162
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,720
...capable of sustaining life.

163
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,160
And we arrived there this morning.

164
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:28,960
So you're saying we're here because of a map
you two kids found in a cave. Is that right?

165
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,400
- No.
- Yeah.

166
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,960
No. Not a map, an invitation.

167
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,440
From who?

168
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,520
We call them Engineers.

169
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,880
Engineers?

170
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,840
Do you mind...

171
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,520
...telling us what they engineered?

172
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,040
They engineered us.

173
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,480
Bullshit.

174
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,440
Okay, so do you...

175
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,200
...have anything to back that up?

176
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,600
Look, if you're willing to discount...

177
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,480
...centuries of Darwinism, that's...

178
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,480
But how do you know?

179
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,200
I don't.

180
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,720
But it's what I choose to believe.

181
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,480
Doctors.

182
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,440
Miss Vickers would like to have
a quick word before the adventure begins.

183
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,520
Wow, nice place.

184
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:57,680
It's actually a separate module
with its own self-contained life support.

185
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,680
Air, food.

186
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,440
Anything Miss Vickers would need
to survive a hostile environment.

187
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,520
Okay, so she lives on a lifeboat.

188
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,680
Yes.

189
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,480
I do.

190
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,840
I like to minimize risk.

191
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,840
David, why don't you make
the doctors a drink?

192
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,000
I'll take a vodka. Up.

193
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,760
Charlie, look.

194
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,200
It's a Pauling Med-Pod.

195
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,760
They only made a dozen of these.

196
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,720
Miss Shaw.

197
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,240
<i>Please verbally slate</i>
<i>the nature of your injury.</i>

198
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,240
Please don't touch that.

199
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,280
It's a very expensive piece of machinery.

200
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,200
It does bypass surgery.
What do you need it for?

201
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,480
There might be some confusion
about our relationship.

202
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,200
Weyland found you impressive enough
to fund this mission.

203
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,760
But I'm fairly certain your Engineers
are scribblings...

204
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,120
...of savages living in dirty little caves.

205
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,200
But let's say I'm wrong,
and you do find these beings down there...

206
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,360
...you won't engage them...

207
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,000
...you won't talk to them.

208
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,840
You will do nothing
but report back to me.

209
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,400
Miss Vickers, is there an agenda that...

210
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,120
...you're not telling us about?

211
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,280
My company...

212
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,920
...paid a trillion dollars to find this place
and bring you.

213
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,720
Had you raised the monies yourself,
Mr. Holloway...

214
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,680
...we'd happily be pursuing your agenda.

215
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,160
But you didn't.

216
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,040
And that makes you an employee.

217
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,400
But if we can't make contact...

218
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,960
...why did you even bring us here?

219
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,360
Weyland was a superstitious man.

220
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,280
He wanted a true believer on board.

221
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,960
Cheers.

222
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,280
So no response?

223
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,960
I'm sorry, no.

224
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,960
Maybe they didn't understand it.

225
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,240
How are your lessons going, David?

226
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,840
I spent two years deconstructing
dozens of ancient languages...

227
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,960
...to their roots. I'm confident...

228
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,600
...I can communicate with them...

229
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,920
...provided your thesis is correct.

230
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,200
"Provided it's correct." That's good.

231
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,160
That's why they call it a thesis, doctor.

232
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,720
What are you smiling about?

233
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,680
Mr. Ravel, Mr. Chance, take her down.

234
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,280
- Roger that.
- Yes, captain.

235
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,040
Descent trajectory mapped.

236
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,680
How we doing?

237
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,920
Great.

238
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,880
All right, boss.

239
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,240
All personnel...

240
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,520
...this is the captain.

241
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,040
Brace for entry.

242
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,440
Yes, captain.

243
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,400
That means you too, Vickers.

244
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,640
<i>All systems...</i>

245
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,720
<i>...online.</i>

246
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,960
What is the atmosphere?

247
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,280
Atmosphere is...

248
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,680
...71 percent nitrogen...

249
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,960
...21 percent oxygen...

250
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,200
...traces of argon gas.

251
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,400
Whoa, now, that's weather.

252
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,600
Just like home.

253
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,480
If you're breathing
through an exhaust pipe.

254
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,920
CO2 is over 3 percent.

255
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Two minutes without a suit, you're dead.

256
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,480
Peak portside.

257
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,400
Whoa, 52,000!

258
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,680
It makes Everest
look like a baby brother.

259
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,040
All right, take us around.

260
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,920
We'll use that as our point of entry.

261
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,400
Terrain data rezzing up. We've got...

262
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,920
...a couple of hard spots.

263
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,480
Could be metal.

264
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,640
No radio, no heat source.

265
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,720
Nobody's home.

266
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,440
There is nothing in the desert...

267
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,800
...and no man needs nothing.

268
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,320
What was that?

269
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,520
Just something from a film I like.

270
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,040
Let's go through that gateway.

271
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,280
Reduce airspeed by a hundred knots.

272
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,440
Going through. Nice and slow.

273
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,240
Keep it steady, boys.

274
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,000
There.

275
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,080
No, what are you doing?

276
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,000
Dr. Holloway, why don't you take a seat?

277
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,160
Right there. God does not build in...

278
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,280
...straight lines.
Starboard side, this valley! Captain...

279
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,920
...could you put us down there?

280
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,240
I wouldn't be any good
if I couldn't do that.

281
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,560
Mr. Ravel, starboard 90 degrees.

282
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:34,320
- One mile, port bow.
- One mile, port bow.

283
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,200
Engage landing sequence.

284
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,440
Switch to manual.

285
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,720
<i>- Commence landing.</i>
<i>- Easy.</i>

286
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,800
- Roger that.
- Yeah, baby, yeah.

287
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,800
Bringing her down in five.

288
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,720
- Preparing RC5 thrusters.
- Four.

289
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,880
Two. Easy does it.

290
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,400
<i>Generator systems are inactive.</i>

291
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,800
<i>Temperature is at 2.724 K.</i>

292
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,200
Captain, would you...

293
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,240
...tell the survey team to suit up...

294
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,760
...and meet us in the airlock.

295
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,000
Only six hours left of daylight.

296
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,760
- Leave it till morning.
- No, no, no.

297
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,880
It's Christmas, captain...

298
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,800
...and I want to open my presents.

299
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:38,920
You, boy.

300
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,320
You're coming with us.

301
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,040
I'd be delighted.

302
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,920
<i>Attention: Ramp will open in five minutes.</i>

303
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,520
Hey, Jackson...

304
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,080
...what's that for?

305
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,800
Expedition security.

306
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,440
My job is to make sure
everybody is nice and safe.

307
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,800
This is a scientific expedition.
No weapons.

308
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,000
All right, then.

309
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,680
Good luck with that.

310
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,240
David, why are you wearing a suit, man?

311
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,720
I beg your pardon?

312
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,480
You don't breathe, remember?

313
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,720
So why wear a suit?

314
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,320
I was designed like this...

315
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,520
...because you people are more comfortable
interacting with your own kind.

316
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,800
If I didn't wear the suit,
it would defeat the purpose.

317
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,640
They're making you guys pretty close, huh?

318
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,560
Not too close, I hope.

319
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,480
<i>Attention: Ramp will open in 15 seconds.</i>

320
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,240
<i>Ramp will open in five...</i>

321
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:56,320
<i>...four, three, two, one.</i>

322
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,240
Hey.

323
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,240
This is just one small step for mankind.

324
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,040
Seriously?

325
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,720
You ready to do this? I know you are.

326
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,880
Hey, Fifield.

327
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,160
I want a spectrograph on this.

328
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,480
I want to know if it's natural
or if somebody put it there.

329
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,200
I can't tell you if it's natural or not.
But what I can...

330
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,400
...tell you is, it's hollow.

331
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:13,160
Prometheus, are you seeing this?

332
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,560
Affirmative.

333
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,160
We see it.

334
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,720
Okay, ready?

335
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,240
- Yeah.
- Let's do it.

336
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,400
- After you.
- After you.

337
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,480
Okay.

338
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,640
Careful.

339
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,200
<i>Prometheus, we're going in.</i>

340
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,480
Copy that.

341
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,440
What's back here?

342
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,640
Some kind of a corridor?

343
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,000
Mr. Fifield,
let's get a grid of the structure.

344
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,480
I want the whole interior.

345
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,640
If there's anything in here
worth looking at...

346
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,000
...these pups'll find them.

347
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,520
"Pups"?

348
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,960
Yeah, pups. My pups.

349
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,760
Prometheus, we are now mapping.

350
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,960
Copy that.

351
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,720
Well, I'll be damned.

352
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,040
Fifield, you got a read?

353
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,280
Yeah.

354
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,800
Pups are saying this way.

355
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,000
Look at this.

356
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,640
Oh, Charlie.

357
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,480
Jesus.

358
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,520
The sunlight is heating the water.

359
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,720
Check out the humidity.

360
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,440
Yeah, and look at the CO2 levels.

361
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,960
Outside...

362
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,040
...it's completely toxic, and in here...

363
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,240
...there's nothing. It's breathable.

364
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,720
What are you doing?

365
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,040
- Don't be an idiot.
- Don't be a skeptic.

366
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,560
There's something
generating an atmosphere.

367
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,160
David?

368
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,400
- Dr. Holloway is correct.
- Cleaner than Earth...

369
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,680
...actually.

370
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,720
They were terraforming.

371
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,440
Please don't do...

372
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,280
I'm not wearing this thing anymore.

373
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,000
Wish me luck, baby.

374
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,720
<i>Do you copy?</i>
<i>Do not remove your headgear.</i>

375
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,480
You crazy bastard.

376
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,160
Connect our suit cameras...

377
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:23,400
...if you want to continue watching this
freak show. We are taking our helmets off.

378
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,080
<i>Copy that. Switching feeds.</i>

379
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,080
Well, come on. Pay up.

380
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,400
- Pay what?
- What do you mean, "Pay what"?

381
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,920
Something is manufacturing
breathable air down there. That, mate...

382
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,720
- ...is terraforming.
- No, no. The bet was why we came here.

383
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,640
If you said a dead old man wanted
to talk to Martians, I'd pay.

384
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,080
Come on, a hundred credits.

385
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,080
Put it towards a lap dance with
Miss Vickers. How about that?

386
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,240
It's minus 12 in here.

387
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,440
So why is this water not frozen?

388
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,960
Maybe it ain't water.

389
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,040
Maybe it's Martian piss.

390
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,960
That's your scientific theory?

391
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,960
Is it? Mr. Biology?

392
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,760
Whatever it is, it sure is collagenous.

393
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,480
Some kind of sediment, perhaps.

394
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,800
Impressive.

395
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,440
What was that?

396
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,480
David?

397
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:55,960
David?

398
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,480
What is that?

399
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,280
David?

400
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,920
Ellie!

401
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,360
What was that?

402
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,920
I'm really glad we didn't bring weapons.

403
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,280
- Come on, El. Let's go.
- Whose idea was that?

404
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:22,560
Keep up!

405
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,520
Come on!

406
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,520
Where did he go?

407
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,080
Wait, wait, wait.

408
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,840
There it is. There it is. There it is.

409
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,160
Oh, my God, Charlie. We found them.

410
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,840
What do you mean "them"?

411
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,440
It is them, Ellie.

412
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,680
It looks like a door...

413
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,840
...and he's been decapitated by it.

414
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,520
Son of a bitch.

415
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,520
They were right.

416
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,880
What did you want them to be? Wrong?

417
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,560
David...

418
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,880
...please tell me you can read that.

419
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,680
Perhaps.

420
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,480
No, I'm out of here.

421
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,120
Hey, Fifield, where are you going?

422
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,800
What?

423
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,040
Look, I'm just a geologist.

424
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,240
I like rocks. I love rocks!

425
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,040
Now it's clear
you two don't give a shit about rocks.

426
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,680
But what you do seem to care about
is gigantic dead...

427
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,520
...bodies.

428
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,600
As I don't really have anything
to contribute in the gigantic...

429
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,120
...dead body arena...

430
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:55,000
...I want to go back to the ship,
if you don't mind.

431
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,040
Anyone wanna...

432
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,200
...join me, hey? You staying?

433
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,880
No, ship's good.

434
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,120
Yeah. Ship very good.

435
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,000
Congratulations on meeting your maker.

436
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,920
Thank you.

437
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,240
Pull yourself...

438
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,320
...together, man.

439
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,440
And I thought you were the crazy one.

440
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,720
Do you have the carbon reader?

441
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,240
Thank you.

442
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,400
How long's it been dead?

443
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,040
Two thousand years...

444
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,360
...give or take.

445
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,320
What are you doing, David?

446
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,880
I'm attempting to open the door.

447
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,200
Wait. We don't know
what's on the other side.

448
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,880
Oops. Sorry.

449
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,560
Look, Ford. It's the head.

450
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,840
An amazing state of preservation.

451
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,800
- We'll take it in.
- Yeah.

452
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,160
Remarkably human.

453
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,720
Beautiful painting.

454
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,040
It's a mural.

455
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:58,800
Stop.

456
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,040
Stop. Don't touch it.

457
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,320
Sorry.

458
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,320
Please, don't touch anything.

459
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:05,840
Sweating.

460
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,360
Organic.

461
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,560
Oh, no.

462
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,480
Charlie, the murals are changing.

463
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,960
I think we've affected the atmosphere
in the room.

464
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,960
<i>Charlie, do you cop}!-7</i>

465
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,680
Oh, the head!

466
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,000
Ford, quick, help me bag the head!

467
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,560
<i>- Boss.</i>
<i>- What you got?</i>

468
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,400
We got an incoming storm front.

469
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,640
Silica...

470
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,720
<i>...and lots of static. This is not good.</i>

471
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,600
I see it.

472
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,400
<i>Ground crew...</i>

473
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,520

00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,440
<i>I need you to hustle back right now.</i>

475
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,120
<i>Ground crew, do you copy me?</i>

476
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,560
<i>I got 200-kilometer...</i>

477
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,200
<i>...winds of airborne silica...</i>

478
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,840
...and enough static to fry your suit.

479
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,440
Copy that, sir.

480
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,520
We need more time.

481
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,480
I'll be closing the outer...

482
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,800
...doors in 15 minutes.

483
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,040
<i>I sincerely hope you can make it.</i>

484
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,520
Charlie! David!

485
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,080
We must leave now.

486
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,800
This is just another tomb.

487
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,240
David!

488
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,840
- On three.
- Two, three, up.

489
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,320
Let's go!

490
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,680
Easy, easy, easy. Careful.

491
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,240
David, we are leaving!

492
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,200
Come on!

493
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,040
Damn it, they've already taken off.

494
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,080
Come on, let's go.

495
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,680
<i>Prometheus to ground crew.</i>
<i>You're running out of lime.</i>

All right, come on. Let's go.

497
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,840
Go faster!

498
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,840
Charlie! The head!

499
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,240
Ellie, no!

500
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,040
What are you doing?

501
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,240
<i>Hatch closure...</i>

502
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,440
<i>- ...in five seconds.</i>
- Shit.

503
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,400
Damn it, hold on!

504
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,400
Goddamn it.

505
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,600
<i>Door closing.</i>

506
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,800
Ellie, don't move!

507
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,440
Charlie!

508
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,840
Grab my hand!

509
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:56,960
No!

510
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:58,920
No, Ellie!

511
00:41:59,040 --> 00:41:59,840
Ellie!

512
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,520
Got it.

513
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,920
So, what was that, Ellie?

514
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,520
You could've compromised the mission.
Not to mention...

515
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,040
...almost killing yourself!

516
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,160
Are you all right?

517
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,880
Yes.

518
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,240
Thank you, David.

519
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,160
My pleasure.

520
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,240
Doctors, it's real good to have...

521
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,600
...you back,
but where's Millburn and Fifield?

522
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,440
<i>Aren't they back yet?</i>

523
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,320
- Get them up for me.
- All right.

524
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,800
We've been here before, Fifield.

525
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,520
I don't know. It all looks the same to me.

526
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,400
<i>Boys, this is the captain. Listen up.</i>

527
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,560
Between the static electricity
and the wind speed...

528
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,960
...well, there ain't no safe way
to come get you.

529
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,240
What?

530
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,800
<i>The temperature is dropping rapidly,</i>
<i>so get your helmets on and stay warm...</i>

531
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,360
...until the storm passes.

532
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,320
<i>Captain...</i>

533
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,640
...can you get a message to the scientist
and his zealot girlfriend?

534
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,800
<i>You got a pen nearby?</i>

535
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,800
No. No, I think we got it.

536
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,200
<i>Tell them I said... themselves.</i>

537
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:42,120
Copy?

538
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,480
<i>Copy that.</i>
<i>All right, boys, keep your head down...</i>

539
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,840
...and we'll come get you in the morning.

540
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,480
<i>Well, which way now?</i>

541
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:50,400
All right.

542
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,520
<i>Well, which way, huh?</i>

543
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,840
Sample is sterile. No contagion present.

544
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,160
David.

545
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,120
So are they all dead?

546
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,360
What? Who?

547
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,080
Your Engineers.

548
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,160
Are they all dead or aren't they?

549
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,800
I don't know.

550
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,200
We just got here.

551
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:25,320
Scan.

552
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,320
Do you care if they're dead?

553
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,520
Weyland cared.

554
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,360
Dr. Shaw.

555
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,600
Have a look at this.

556
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,000
- That's not an exoskeleton.
- No.

557
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:43,040
I think it's a helmet.

558
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,520
- Let's see if we can lift it up.
- We should...

559
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,040
...be able to prize this open.

560
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:50,000
It's too heavy for us. David?

561
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,000
Careful.

562
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,920
Like so.

563
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,960
What is that on its head?

564
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:17,400
It looks like new cells.

565
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,160
- In a state of...
- Change.

566
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,040
Yes.

567
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,600
Changing into what?

568
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,160
Can you run a stem line
into the locus coeruleus?

569
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,640
I think we can trick the nervous system
into thinking it's still alive.

570
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,400
- Thirty amps-
- Okay.

571
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:32,800
No more.

572
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,200
Let me make an incision.

573
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:37,640
Okay.

574
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,400
Go up, 40.

575
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,400
Okay, 40 "P-

576
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,000
Did you see that?

577
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,240
- Yes.
- Yep. See?

578
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,960
Go up another 10.

579
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,640
Okay, up 10.

580
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,000
Maybe it's a little...

581
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,920
- ...too much. Go down 10.
- Okay.

582
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,440
- Down 10.
- Down another 20.

583
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:04,680
Okay, I'm trying-

584
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:07,200
I'm trying, it's not going down.

585
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,640
Full down. Ford...

586
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:09,680
...stop it.

587
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,080
Oh, God.

588
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,280
David, contain it! Now!

589
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,640
Contain it? Turn it off!

590
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,360
Oh, God. The smell!

591
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,160
Oh, God, look at that.

592
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,280
Look at that.

593
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,560
It's getting worse.

594
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,360
Mortal, after all.

595
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,680
Ford, take a sample.

596
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,360
Let's have a look.

597
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,120
No, sir, I will take care of it.

598
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,720
Yes, sir, understood. I'm sorry.

599
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,200
Fortunately, slightly premature.

600
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:06,480
Of course, sir.

601
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:34,880
Miss Vickers.

602
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:40,400
What did he say, David?

603
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,960
I don't think he'd want me to tell you.

604
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,560
What did he say?

605
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:53,480
I'm sorry...

606
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:54,720
...that's confidential.

607
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,720
So help me God...

608
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:00,920
...I will find the cord that makes you run
and I will cut it.

609
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:03,640
What did he say?

610
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:06,360
He said:

611
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:09,680
"Try harder."

612
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,520
Cup of tea, ma':-am?

613
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,480
Genetic view.

614
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:31,480
Okay.

615
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,960
Let's have a look at its DNA.

616
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:43,960
Isolate the strand.

617
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:46,600
Okay.

618
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:49,200
Compare it to the gene sample?

619
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,600
Yeah.

620
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:51,960
Overlay.

621
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,560
<i>Processing.</i>

622
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,680
<i>Processing.</i>

623
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,680
<i>DNA match.</i>

624
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,480
Oh, my God.

625
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,080
It's us.

626
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,560
It's everything.

627
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:31,200
What killed them?

628
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:48,920
Big things...

629
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:51,000
...have small beginnings.

630
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,400
Am I interrupting?

631
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:04,080
I thought you might be running low.

632
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,720
- Pour yourself a glass, pal.
- Thank you, but I'm afraid...

633
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,240
...it would be wasted on me.

634
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,000
Right, I almost forgot you're not a real boy.

635
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:21,200
I'm very sorry that your Engineers
are all gone.

636
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:28,200
You think we wasted our time
coming here, don't you?

637
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:34,040
Your question depends on me understanding
what you hoped to achieve by coming here.

638
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,920
What we hoped to achieve
was to meet our makers.

639
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:37,960
To get answers.

640
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:40,240
Why they even...

641
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,880
...made us in the first place.

642
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,600
Why do you think your people made me?

643
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:49,000
Because we could.

644
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,080
Can you imagine how disappointing
it would be...

645
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,240
...to hear the same thing
from your creator?

646
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:02,120
I guess it's...

647
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:03,960
...good you can't be disappointed.

648
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,960
Yes. It's wonderful...

649
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:07,200
...actually.

650
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:09,080
May I ask you something?

651
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,200
Please do.

652
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:12,560
How far would you go...

653
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:15,840
...to get what you came all this way for?

654
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,280
Your answers.

655
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:19,680
What are you willing to do?

656
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,520
Anything and everything.

657
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,920
That's worth drinking to, I'd imagine.

658
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,640
Here's mud in your eye, pal.

659
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:43,200
Good health.

660
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,080
It's those things.

661
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:53,680
Are they real?

662
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,560
Of course they're real.

663
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,240
Jesus Christ. I mean...

664
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:01,600
Look at the pile.

665
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,080
Look how high up they are.

666
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:05,640
It looks like...

667
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:09,880
- ...they were running from something.
- Okay. Don't touch, okay?

668
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:14,480
Man, this thing is opened up
from the inside.

669
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,080
Almost like it exploded.

670
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:20,920
Looks like a scene out some sort
of holocaust painting, you know?

671
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:34,720
Well...

672
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:43,160
So, whatever killed them
is long gone, right?

673
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,400
<i>Millburn, Fifield.</i>

674
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:45,640
<i>This is Prometheus.</i>

675
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,000
What is your position?

676
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,520
Prometheus, this is Millburn.

677
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,600
We are at 7-4-D...

678
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,960
...1-4-1-1. why?

679
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:57,520
Just got a ping
about one click west of you.

680
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,160
What do you mean "a ping"?

681
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,200
<i>Well, whatever...</i>

682
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:03,280
...that probe is picking up...

683
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:04,560
...it's not dead.

684
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,360
It's reading a life form.

685
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,920
- What?
- Okay, what do you mean, "a life form"?

686
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:10,920
Is it...? Is it moving?

687
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,520
No, I don't think so.

688
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,080
Captain, you're...

689
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,680
...obviously not seeing...

690
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:18,160
...what we're seeing here.

691
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:20,520
<i>If you were,</i>
<i>you wouldn't be talking about a ping.</i>

692
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:21,880
I know, boys.

693
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:25,360
Your signal has been coming in
sporadically since the storm hit.

694
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:27,960
<i>That's no good to us down here!</i>

695
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:33,160
<i>Is it...? Is it moving?</i>
<i>Are these things moving?</i>

696
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,720
No. No, it just disappeared, actually.

697
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:40,360
<i>Must be a glitch.</i>

698
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,920
What do you mean, "a glitch"?

699
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:43,960
<i>All right, boys.</i>

700
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,120
Sleep tight.

701
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,440
Try not to bugger each other.

702
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,520
<i>Captain, what do you mean, "a glitch"?</i>

703
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:53,560
<i>Millburn, what does he mean? Wail.</i>

704
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:55,560
<i>Now, he said...</i>

705
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:59,120
<i>- He said one click west, yeah?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

706
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,160
Now, we...

707
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,120
We don't want to check that out, do we?

708
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,280
Shit, no.

709
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:05,680
Where are we gonna go?

710
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:06,840
East.

711
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:09,560
Yeah, east.

712
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:13,600
A fucking glitch, man.
"Pings, glitch, life form." What the fuck?

713
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:18,000
Based on the behavior of the subject
in these holographic recordings...

714
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:20,680
...we're attempting to identify
what caused the head...

715
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,920
...to combust. I can't help but wonder...

716
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:25,880
...was there an outbreak here?

717
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:31,280
You rang...

718
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,560
- ...ma'am?
- I have something important...

719
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,480
...to tell you. What is that?

720
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:37,840
This is...

721
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:40,240
...a rose that I had frozen
with the champagne.

722
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,400
I was gonna give it to you
when we found what we came for.

723
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:46,360
We did find what we came for.

724
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:47,880
They were here. This is...

725
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,440
The most significant discovery
in the history...

726
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,640
...of mankind. Oh, I know.

727
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,120
It's incredible, it really is.

728
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:03,000
But I wanted to talk to them.

729
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:06,040
I mean, don't you want to know
why they came?

730
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:08,840
Why they abandoned us?

731
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,000
I just want answers, baby.

732
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:12,560
We were right, Charlie.

733
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,000
I have proof.

734
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:17,760
Look.

735
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:26,520
Their genetic material predates ours.

736
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,080
We come from them.

737
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,080
- You're kidding me.
- No.

738
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,120
Okay.

739
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:36,720
Okay.

740
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:41,680
Okay. I guess you can take
your father's cross off now.

741
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,560
Why would I want to do that?

742
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:46,720
Because they made us.

743
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,120
And who made them?

744
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Well, exactly. We'll never know.

745
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:53,120
But here's what we do know:

746
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:57,000
That there is nothing special
about the creation of life.

747
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,520
Right? Anybody can do it.

748
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:01,560
All you need is a dash of DNA
and half a brain, right?

749
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:05,560
I can't.

750
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:09,240
I can't create life.

751
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,560
What does that say about me?

752
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:17,680
Ellie, that's not... I didn't mean...

753
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,360
I wasn't talking about...

754
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:21,080
Children?

755
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,400
Us.

756
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,920
Hey, hey. hey-

757
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:28,400
Hey.

758
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:30,360
Hey.

759
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:33,000
Elizabeth Shaw...

760
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:36,520
...you are the most special person
I have ever met in my life...

761
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,440
...and I love you.

762
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:43,520
Hey.

763
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:28,120
How much longer will this take?

764
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:31,560
I don't know.

765
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,120
I'm just a captain.

766
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:44,240
That thing sounds like a dying cat,
by the way.

767
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:48,080
I'll have you know that this thing...

768
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:50,440
...once belonged to Stephen Stills.

769
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:53,280
Am I supposed to know who that is?

770
00:57:58,040 --> 00:57:59,520
You know...

771
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:01,640
...if you wanna get laid...

772
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:03,600
...you really don't have to pretend...

773
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:05,800
...to be interested in the pyramid scan.

774
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:10,200
You could just say,
"Hey, I'm trying to get laid."

775
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,520
I could. I could say that, right?

776
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:14,520
But it wouldn't make sense...

777
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:18,640
...why I would fly myself half a billion miles
from every man on Earth...

778
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:20,720
...if I wanted to get laid, would it?

779
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:24,240
Hey, Vickers.

780
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,160
Hey, Vickers.

781
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:29,080
I was wondering...

782
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:34,520
Are you a robot?

783
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:43,800
My room.

784
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:45,680
Ten minutes.

785
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:53,560
<i>Well, if you can'! be with the one you love</i>

786
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:54,600
<i>Love the one</i>

787
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:55,880
<i>You're with</i>

788
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:57,440
<i>Love the one you're with</i>

789
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:05,200
Millburn.

790
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:07,280
What's all this black stuff?

791
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:12,520
Gazpacho.

792
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:15,960
Is that tobacco?

793
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:17,640
Is that tobacco...

794
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:18,920
...in your respirator?

795
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,600
Yeah, sure.

796
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:26,320
Tobacco.

797
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:30,480
On behalf of scientists everywhere,
lam ashamed to count you amongst us...

798
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,160
...Fifield. Really.

799
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:37,280
- Hey, Millburn.
- Yeah?

800
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:38,320
You see this thing?

801
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:41,680
What do you think this thing was?
Some kind of a god?

802
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,120
Something they worshiped? What?

803
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:45,960
- It kind of looks like...
- What's that?

804
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:47,600
What the hell is that?

805
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,000
Oh, my God. Okay.

806
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:50,440
Just stay calm. Stay quiet.

807
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:52,720
This is okay, I can handle this.

808
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:54,320
Hey, baby-

809
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:55,760
Hey.

810
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:57,880
<i>Come in, Prometheus.</i>

811
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:01,600
<i>We have an elongate reptile-type creature.</i>

812
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:05,760
<i>Maybe 30, 40 inches, with transparent skin.</i>

813
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,480
And it's beautiful.

814
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:09,560
Okay!

815
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:13,480
<i>Prometheus...</i>

816
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:14,320
...we have two.

817
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,920
Look at you. Look at you, baby.

818
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:19,720
Jesus, look at the size of that.
What is it?

819
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:22,320
- You need to stay calm.
- What's there to be calm about?

820
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:24,800
You need to stay calm
because she is beautiful.

821
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,640
What makes you think that's female?

822
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:28,040
She's a lady. Look!

823
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:34,800
Hey.

824
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:36,640
She's mesmerized.

825
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:39,120
Come here. Come here.

826
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:42,320
It's okay.

827
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,120
It's okay. It's okay.

828
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:46,000
Hey, baby-

829
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:49,960
You're strong!

830
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:51,240
You should...

831
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:52,080
...help me now.

832
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:52,880
Get it off.

833
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,160
Cut it here, man!

834
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:57,400
I ain't touching that!

835
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,240
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

836
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,400
- It's getting tighter.
- I ain't touching it!

837
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:05,200
Cut the thing, man, for God's sake!

838
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:07,200
God, you're making it worse!

839
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:09,120
It's tightening! It's tight...

840
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:10,640
It's breaking my arm!

841
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:13,080
Shit!

842
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:14,280
Cut it off!

843
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:16,120
Cut it off!

844
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:17,080
Cut it off!

845
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:17,800
Cut it off!

846
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:21,280
Shit!

847
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:22,160
Oh, my God!

848
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,400
Oh, my God! Oh, Jesus!

849
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:27,960
It's in my suit.

850
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:28,880
Jesus Christ.

851
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,240
<i>Shaw, you up?</i>

852
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:31,000
Yeah, what's up?

853
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,480
<i>The storm passed,</i>
<i>bull can'! reach Millburn...</i>

854
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:36,680
<i>...or Fifield. Taking a few men down,</i>
<i>see if I can rustle them up.</i>

855
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:37,960
Okay.

856
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:40,320
Any idea where they are?

857
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:44,040
Last time they radioed in
was where you found your head.

858
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:46,440
<i>Okay, we're coming.</i>

859
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:47,280
All right.

860
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:50,160
Chance, you're coming with me. Come on.

861
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:51,280
All right, boss.

862
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:55,720
- Ravel, did you fix that glitch?
- No, captain.

863
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:58,560
<i>- It's gotta be in the hardware.</i>
- What glitch, captain?

864
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:01,120
One of them probes picked up a life form.

865
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:02,720
Pops up every hour...

866
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,680
...for a couple of seconds
and then it's gone.

867
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:07,400
I can find the probe and fix it.

868
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:09,080
Knock yourself out.

869
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:11,760
Be careful, doctors.

870
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:33,800
Fifield!

871
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:37,600
Millburn?

872
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:43,040
All right, come on down.

873
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:06,040
<i>David, are you alone?</i>

874
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:08,160
Yes, Miss Vickers.

875
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:10,440
<i>Uplink your feed to my room.</i>

876
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:11,760
<i>COPY-</i>

877
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:52,320
You son of a bitch.

878
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:56,000
You cut me off.

879
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:17,680
What is this?

880
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:22,200
- Charlie?
- I just tripped.

881
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,600
Oh, my God, you're sick!

882
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:25,600
I'm okay, baby. Come on.

883
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:26,760
Fifield?

884
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:28,720
Millburn?

885
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:36,440
Hey, Chance. I wouldn't touch...

886
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:37,680
...that if I were you.

887
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:41,720
Dr. Shaw?

888
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:43,000
Yeah?

889
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:45,080
Do we have any idea what is...

890
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:46,600
...oozing out of these vases?

891
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:49,760
No. They weren't like this
last time we were here.

892
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:55,400
Captain?

893
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:56,760
What?

894
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:57,960
Who is it? Which one?

895
01:06:58,120 --> 01:06:59,880
- Who is it?
- It's Millburn.

896
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:02,160
- Ellie.
- Don't touch him. Hold on.

897
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:03,120
Ellie, honey.

898
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:05,080
Charlie, what's wrong?

899
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,640
I need you to look at me, okay?

900
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:08,920
You know infections...

901
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:10,080
...so, what do you see?

902
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:11,760
This is not good, baby.

903
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:13,760
You look at me,
you tell me what you see.

904
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:18,680
Oh, my God.

905
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:20,640
Ford, get over here.

906
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:22,320
It's okay. Janek?

907
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:24,080
- What?
- We have to go now!

908
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:24,920
What do you see?

909
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:27,000
Honey, what do you see?

910
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:29,120
Holloway's sick. He's not good.

911
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:29,880
I see movement...

912
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:30,640
...in his esophagus.

913
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:36,440
- Come on, baby.
- No. I'm okay.

914
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:37,520
Janek!

915
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:38,800
Come over and help me!

916
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:41,200
- I'm okay.
- Ford, get over there. What's happening?

917
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:42,320
- I'm okay.
- Let's go!

918
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:43,600
Help me with him.

919
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:46,520
I got you.
We're gonna get you out of here.

920
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:47,280
<i>Prometheus...</i>

921
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:48,120
...come in.

922
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:50,120
- Watch your head.
- Okay. I'm okay.

923
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:51,960
- Holloway.
- Get him up.

924
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:53,880
- Come on.
- Prometheus, come in.

925
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,120
<i>Is anyone there?</i>

926
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:57,000
This is Vickers.

927
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:59,520
I need a medical team
standing by the airlock.

928
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:01,760
<i>Full quarantine fail-safe.</i>

929
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:03,320
<i>Holloway's sick.</i>

930
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:04,680
Sick with what?

931
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:06,920
- Just do it.
- Let's get him back to the ship.

932
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:09,080
<i>- It's not safe down here.</i>
<i>- Charlie?</i>

933
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:10,040
I'm suiting up.

934
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:11,760
<i>- Charlie, talk to me.</i>
<i>- Move!</i>

935
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:14,160
<i>- What was that back there?</i>
<i>- Let's go, people!</i>

936
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:17,920
<i>We've gotta move!</i>
<i>We've gotta move!</i>

937
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:18,840
<i>Ellie!</i>

938
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:07,880
He don't look too good.

939
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:10,680
Did he catch something down there?
We had our helmets off.

940
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:11,480
I don't know.

941
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:14,680
Prometheus, this is Janek.
Make sure that back door is open.

942
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,080
<i>Aye, captain.</i>

943
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:18,480
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

944
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:21,320
Come on!

945
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:23,160
Please!

946
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:30,160
Prometheus! Why is that door not open?

947
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:32,440
Vickers, that is an order!

948
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:34,800
Get that goddamn door open!

949
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:37,360
- Look at me. It's too late, I'm sick.
- No, it's not.

950
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:38,720
Come on!

951
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:40,080
Ford, help me!

952
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:42,360
Airlock crew, if you can hear me,
it's Janek.

953
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:44,120
<i>Open that back door right now!</i>

954
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:45,360
Hold that door!

955
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:46,160
Prometheus...

956
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:47,080
<i>...do you copy?</i>

957
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:49,600
<i>Goddamn it, open that door!</i>
<i>That is an order!</i>

958
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:50,840
Open it.

959
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:58,840
What the hell is this?

960
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:00,440
He's not coming on board.

961
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:02,080
Vickers, this is a sick man.

962
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:03,280
I see that. That's why...

963
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:04,440
...he's not coming on!

964
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:06,160
Charlie!

965
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:07,320
Chance, get over here!

966
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:11,160
Please!

967
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:12,360
We can still help him!

968
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:16,440
Help yourself.
Everybody but Holloway back on this ship!

969
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:18,160
I won't leave him!

970
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:19,120
Then stay!

971
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:20,360
Wait! We could...

972
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:22,160
...put him on the Med-Pod!

973
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:23,320
Please don't do this.

974
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:24,800
It's okay, Ellie.

975
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:25,920
Vickers!

976
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:27,040
What are you doing?

977
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:28,400
I love you, baby.

978
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:29,360
- I love you.
- No.

979
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:30,800
I'm telling you, stay back!

980
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:31,600
Do it.

981
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:32,600
Stay back!

982
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:33,840
No! No, Charlie!

983
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:34,520
- Do it.
- No!

984
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:41,200
No!

985
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:44,600
No!

986
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:46,520
No!

987
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:51,120
Charlie!

988
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:55,280
No!

989
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:10,040
My deepest condolences.

990
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:13,040
I'm going to have to take this.

991
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:14,680
It may be contaminated.

992
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:19,600
If there's a contagion,
we were all exposed.

993
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:24,800
You need... We need to run blood work
on everyone who set foot in the pyramid.

994
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:26,760
Yes, of course.

995
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,200
Yes?

996
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:37,560
I understand how...

997
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:39,160
...in:-appropriate this is...

998
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:42,160
...given the circumstances.

999
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:45,200
But as you ordered
quarantine fail-safes...

1000
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:49,160
...it's my responsibility to ask.

1001
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:54,080
Have you and Dr. Holloway
had any intimate contact recently?

1002
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:56,440
Since you and he were...

1003
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:57,840
...so close...

1004
01:14:58,720 --> 01:14:59,480
...I want to be...

1005
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:01,080
...as thorough as poss...

1006
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:03,800
My, my-

1007
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:08,680
You're pregnant.

1008
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:12,080
What?

1009
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:15,160
From the look of it, three months so.

1010
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:18,560
No, that's impossible.

1011
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:20,920
I can't be pregnant.

1012
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:24,360
Did you have intercourse
with Dr. Holloway?

1013
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:26,320
Yes...

1014
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:29,400
...but 10 hours ago.

1015
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:33,120
There's no bloody way
I'm three months pregnant.

1016
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:34,080
Well, doctor...

1017
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,040
...it's not exactly a traditional fetus.

1018
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:41,400
I want to see it.

1019
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:43,320
Don't think that's a good idea.

1020
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:47,840
David, I want to see it.

1021
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:49,240
Now, doctor...

1022
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:53,120
I want to see it.

1023
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:55,480
I want it out of me.

1024
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:57,240
We don't have the personnel...

1025
01:15:57,400 --> 01:15:59,840
...to perform a procedure like that.

1026
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:01,760
- Our best option...
- I want it out.

1027
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:02,880
Put you back into...

1028
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,880
...cryostasis until we return to Earth.

1029
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,200
Please, get it out of me.

1030
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:08,920
Get it out of me!

1031
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:10,200
Please.

1032
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:15,320
It must be very painful.

1033
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:18,200
Here, let me give you something.

1034
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:23,680
That's it. There, there.

1035
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:32,240
Someone will be along shortly...

1036
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:34,880
...to bring you back to Cryo Deck.

1037
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:41,160
It must feel
like your God abandoned you.

1038
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:42,880
What?

1039
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:43,800
To lose...

1040
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:48,440
...Dr. Holloway after your father died
under such similar circumstances.

1041
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,040
What was it that killed him?

1042
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:53,160
Ebola?

1043
01:16:57,320 --> 01:17:00,000
How do you...? How do you know that?

1044
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:02,800
I watched your dreams.

1045
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:25,440
Dr. Shaw?

1046
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:27,840
We're here to put you...

1047
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:31,200
...in an anti-contamination suit,
take you back to Cryo Deck...

1048
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:32,960
...go to beddy-byes.

1049
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:35,040
Dr. Shaw?

1050
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:37,880
She's doped. Prepare her.

1051
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:10,720
<i>Emergency procedures initialed.</i>
<i>Please verbally slate the nature of your injury.</i>

1052
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:13,200

Bridge...

...to hangar. This is the captain.

1080
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:38,400
- Yes, captain.
- Can you see what I see?

1081
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:40,560
Fifield's monitor just popped up.

1082
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:42,760
What? Where?

1083
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:45,200
According to what I'm looking at,
it's outside...

1084
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:46,520
...the goddamn ship.

1085
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:48,040
Barnes, open the door!

1086
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:50,120
Fifield, do you copy me? Come on in.

1087
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:51,640
Fifield?

1088
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:04,640
Wait a second.

1089
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:14,320
Hey, Wallace.

1090
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:15,720
Take a look at this.

1091
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:21,600
Fifield?

1092
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:26,360
What the hell is going on down there?

1093
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:40,800
I'm coming down there.

1094
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:42,120
Chance, you're suiting up.

1095
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:43,880
<i>- Come on.</i>
<i>- Don'! let it on the ship!</i>

1096
01:22:58,360 --> 01:22:58,840
Take him out!

1097
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:00,120
Got him!

1098
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:03,040
Do it!

1099
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:08,800
- You ready, Chance?
- Yes.

1100
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:12,480
Come on!

1101
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:13,800
Get in the rover!

1102
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:15,880
We gotta get out of here!

1103
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:23,520
Go!

1104
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:55,000
What is that?

1105
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:31,080
You've been asleep.

1106
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:33,800
You were on the ship all this time. Why?

1107
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:36,560
Well, I...

1108
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:38,520
I have a few days of life left in me.

1109
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:40,920
I didn't wanna waste them...

1110
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:43,200
...until you could deliver
what you promised.

1111
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:45,880
To meet my maker.

1112
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,200
There we are, sir.

1113
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:50,400
- Nice and clean.
- Haven't you told him they're all gone?

1114
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:55,000
But they're not all gone, Dr. Shaw.

1115
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:56,840
One of them is still alive.

1116
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:59,320
We're on our way to see him now.

1117
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:00,640
What?

1118
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:02,240
Turn me around.

1119
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:07,520
You convinced me that...

1120
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,120
...if these things made us...

1121
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:14,760
...then surely they could save us.

1122
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:16,280
My stick, please.

1123
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:22,960
Well, save me, anyway.

1124
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:25,320
Save you from what?

1125
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:27,320
Death, of course.

1126
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:28,640
Stand me up.

1127
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:33,920
I'm all right.

1128
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:35,840
I'm all right.

1129
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:37,960
Yes, sir.

1130
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:39,280
But you don't understand.

1131
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:41,280
You don't know.

1132
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:44,160
This place isn't what we thought it was.
They aren't...

1133
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:46,240
...what we thought they were.

1134
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:47,520
I was wrong.

1135
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:48,920
We were so wrong.

1136
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:50,760
Charlie...

1137
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:53,440
Dr. Holloway's dead.

1138
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:56,640
We must leave!

1139
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:59,040
And what would Charlie do...

1140
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:04,000
...now that we're so close...

1141
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:07,480
...to answering
the most meaningful questions...

1142
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:09,160
...ever asked by mankind?

1143
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:12,120
How can you leave without...

1144
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:14,160
...knowing what they are?

1145
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:22,920
Or have you lost your faith, Shaw?

1146
01:26:57,480 --> 01:27:00,160
Okay. Okay.

1147
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:20,040
Come in.

1148
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:28,840
Where the hell are you going, doc?

1149
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:31,080
You know what this place is?

1150
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:35,040
Those Engineers? This ain't their home.

1151
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:38,720
It's an installation.
Maybe even military.

1152
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:41,840
They put it out here
because they're not stupid enough...

1153
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:45,120
...to make weapons of mass destruction
on their own doorstep.

1154
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:49,160
That's what all that shit is
in those vases.

1155
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:50,720
They made it here.

1156
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:54,800
It got out, it turned on them. The end.

1157
01:27:56,640 --> 01:27:58,720
It's time for us to go home.

1158
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:01,000
One of them is still alive.

1159
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:07,840
Don't you want to know
what they have to say?

1160
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:12,760
I don't care.

1161
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:15,640
Right.

1162
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:18,240
All you do is fly the ship.

1163
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:19,720
That's right.

1164
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:23,320
But you must care
about something, captain.

1165
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:28,200
If you didn't, why are you here?

1166
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:32,480
How about this?

1167
01:28:34,360 --> 01:28:36,600
No matter what happens down there...

1168
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:40,200
...I can't bring none of that shit
back home with us.

1169
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:41,600
Can't let it happen.

1170
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,320
I'll do whatever I have to...

1171
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:46,200
...to see that it doesn't.

1172
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:49,400
Make sure you do, captain.

1173
01:29:04,280 --> 01:29:06,360
So you came after all.

1174
01:29:06,640 --> 01:29:08,160
I thought you wanted me to.

1175
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:10,800
After all your attempts
to stop me from coming here...

1176
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:12,320
...I'm surprised to see you.

1177
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:14,200
It's all right. Leave us.

1178
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:16,160
Yes, sir.

1179
01:29:27,720 --> 01:29:28,320
If you're...

1180
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:30,120
...going down there, you will die.

1181
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:34,880
Very negative way of looking at things.

1182
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:39,200
That's exactly why
you should have stayed at home.

1183
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:42,560
Did you really think I was gonna
sit in a boardroom for years...

1184
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:44,320
...arguing over who was in charge...

1185
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:47,720
...while you go look for some miracle
on some...

1186
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:51,360
...godforsaken rock
in the middle of space?

1187
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:55,840
A king has...

1188
01:29:55,960 --> 01:29:58,440
...his reign, and then he dies.

1189
01:29:59,240 --> 01:30:00,640
It's inevitable.

1190
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,280
That...

1191
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:06,920
...is the natural order of things.

1192
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:20,520
Anything else?

1193
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:23,640
NO...

1194
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:26,400
...Father.

1195
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:28,800
That's it.

1196
01:30:41,240 --> 01:30:42,880
I didn't think you had it in you.

1197
01:30:43,640 --> 01:30:44,280
Sorry.

1198
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:46,760
Poor choice of words.

1199
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:51,160
Extraordinary survival instincts,
Elizabeth.

1200
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:57,520
What happens when Weyland is not...

1201
01:30:57,720 --> 01:30:58,920
...around to program you?

1202
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:01,440
I suppose I'll be free.

1203
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:03,600
You want that?

1204
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:05,240
"Want"?

1205
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:07,200
Not a concept I'm familiar with.

1206
01:31:07,480 --> 01:31:09,040
That being said...

1207
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:11,960
...doesn't everyone
want their parents dead?

1208
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:14,920
I didn't.

1209
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:16,800
Dr. Shaw.

1210
01:31:18,280 --> 01:31:19,640
So pleased you could join us.

1211
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:35,960
You can take your helmet off
if you like, sir.

1212
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:36,840
What?

1213
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:39,360
The air is perfectly breathable.

1214
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:40,640
Are you sure?

1215
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:41,800
Positive.

1216
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:46,880
Wait. We still don't know how
Holloway got infected. If it's in the air.

1217
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:48,800
It's not.

1218
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:50,760
How do you know that?

1219
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,040
Smells fine to me.

1220
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:55,880
- Shall we?
- Please.

1221
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:02,840
The bridge is just up ahead.

1222
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:04,040
What is this?

1223
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:06,920
It's a cargo hold.

1224
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:18,120
Janek? Are you seeing this?

1225
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:20,480
How many is there, Shaw?

1226
01:32:20,640 --> 01:32:21,280
<i>Thousands.</i>

1227
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:24,520
What the hell?

1228
01:32:28,160 --> 01:32:30,120
Ravel, give me those schematics.

1229
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:34,880
Putting it on the table now.

1230
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:37,160
Strip away the dome.

1231
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:40,400
Isolate that area, bring it up.

1232
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:42,160
Bringing it up, captain.

1233
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:46,200
Enlarge that.

1234
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:49,480
Rotate it.

1235
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:54,920
That is a ship.

1236
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:57,280
Jesus Christ.

1237
01:32:59,160 --> 01:33:01,160
It's a goddamn ship.

1238
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:06,800
A superior species, no doubt.

1239
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:11,400
Their hypersleep chambers...

1240
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:14,160
...will impress, I trust.

1241
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:23,400
So they...

1242
01:33:23,560 --> 01:33:27,240
- ...were traveling somewhere.
- I've managed to work out the broad strokes.

1243
01:33:27,320 --> 01:33:30,160
It's fairly evident
they were in the process of leaving...

1244
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,120
...before things went to pot.

1245
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:35,680
Leaving to go where?

1246
01:33:37,480 --> 01:33:38,160
Earth.

1247
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:40,160
Why?

1248
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:43,160
Sometimes to create...

1249
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:45,160
...one must first destroy.

1250
01:33:47,240 --> 01:33:48,520
Where is he, David?

1251
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:50,800
This way, sir.

1252
01:33:56,920 --> 01:33:58,280
Are you sure he's alive?

1253
01:33:59,960 --> 01:34:01,040
Absolutely.

1254
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:06,640
<i>And you can speak to him?</i>

1255
01:34:06,920 --> 01:34:08,360
<i>I believe I can.</i>

1256
01:34:43,160 --> 01:34:44,680
I'm all right, I'm all right.

1257
01:34:46,440 --> 01:34:47,680
Speak to him, David.

1258
01:34:48,920 --> 01:34:50,600
Tell him we came, just like he asked.

1259
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:51,920
Ask where they're from.

1260
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:53,320
What are you doing?

1261
01:34:53,480 --> 01:34:55,120
Ask him what's in his cargo.

1262
01:34:55,240 --> 01:34:56,080
It killed his people.

1263
01:34:56,200 --> 01:34:57,280
Shaw, enough.

1264
01:34:57,560 --> 01:34:59,240
- David.
- You made it here...

1265
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:02,280
...and it was meant for us. Why?

1266
01:35:02,440 --> 01:35:04,240
Enough. For God's sake, shut her up.

1267
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:07,360
I need to know why!

1268
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:09,200
What did we do wrong? Why do you...

1269
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:10,760
- ...hate us?
- She opens her...

1270
01:35:10,920 --> 01:35:11,920
<i>...mouth again, shoot her.</i>

1271
01:35:12,040 --> 01:35:13,920
<i>David, continue. Tell him why! came.</i>

1272
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:34,680
No!

1273
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:41,480
Ford! Move!

1274
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:03,440
There's nothing.

1275
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:10,120
I know.

1276
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:13,600
Have a good journey, Mr. Weyland.

1277
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:21,320
Time to go home.

1278
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:37,200
Mr. Chance, take us home.

1279
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:48,080
Oh, no!

1280
01:37:55,560 --> 01:37:56,520
Hey, cap.

1281
01:37:57,040 --> 01:37:58,120
What the hell was that?

1282
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:41,280
<i>Prometheus!</i>

1283
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:42,800
Come in!

1284
01:38:43,560 --> 01:38:44,800
Shaw, is that you?

1285
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:45,640
<i>COPY-</i>

1286
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:46,440
<i>Janek...</i>

1287
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:47,560
<i>...listen to me</i>

1288
01:38:48,440 --> 01:38:49,640
This ship is taking off!

1289
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:51,360
- What?
- What is she talking about?

1290
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:53,040
<i>You can'! let it leave!</i>

1291
01:38:53,240 --> 01:38:54,280
You have to stop it!

1292
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:57,160
We're not stopping anything, Shaw.
We're going home.

1293
01:38:57,600 --> 01:38:59,560
Janek, if you don't stop it...

1294
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:01,480
...there won't be any home to go back to.

1295
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:05,960
It's carrying death, and it's headed for Earth.

1296
01:39:06,200 --> 01:39:08,480
- Shaw, this is not a warship.
<i>- I know.</i>

1297
01:39:08,640 --> 01:39:09,400
Let's go.

1298
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:10,800
I know that.

1299
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:13,160
But you must do it.

1300
01:39:13,640 --> 01:39:15,240
Captain, let's go!

1301
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:17,400
Janek, please believe me! Please!

1302
01:39:32,440 --> 01:39:34,800
I told you to get this ship going.

1303
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:35,760
Mr. Ravel.

1304
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:37,200
Warm up the ion propulsion.

1305
01:39:37,480 --> 01:39:39,120
- What are you talking about?
- Sir.

1306
01:39:39,240 --> 01:39:40,880
Burning ion in the atmosphere...

1307
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:44,000
- Turns us into a bullet. That's the point.
- What are you doing?

1308
01:39:44,160 --> 01:39:45,840
This is my ship. I'm telling you...

1309
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:47,040
...to take us home!

1310
01:39:47,160 --> 01:39:48,600
Vickers, I'll eject your module onto...

1311
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:50,440
...that surface. Two years of life.

1312
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:52,520
You want it, or you want to stay with me?

1313
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:54,680
You got 40 seconds to get...

1314
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:55,840
...to the escape pod.

1315
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,040
You're crazy.

1316
01:39:57,160 --> 01:39:57,920
Gentlemen...

1317
01:39:58,440 --> 01:40:00,080
...I can handle this myself.

1318
01:40:00,520 --> 01:40:02,240
Feel free to join Miss Vickers.

1319
01:40:03,040 --> 01:40:04,360
All due respect, captain.

1320
01:40:04,520 --> 01:40:07,640
You're a shit pilot and you're gonna
need all the help you can get.

1321
01:40:23,240 --> 01:40:27,240
<i>Well, if you can'! be with the one you love</i>

1322
01:40:27,400 --> 01:40:29,560
If you think this means the bet's off...

1323
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:32,080
...you're wrong.

1324
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:35,920
Why don't you pay me on the other side?

1325
01:40:36,040 --> 01:40:38,080
All right, get us as close as we can.

1326
01:40:38,240 --> 01:40:40,080
Only got one shot at this.

1327
01:40:52,600 --> 01:40:53,240
Lifeboats away!

1330
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:09,600

- Ion propulsion...

1331
01:41:09,800 --> 01:41:10,440
...is online.

1334
01:41:12,840 --> 01:41:13,640
Come on!

1335
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:14,800
<i>Eight.</i>

1336
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:27,840

01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:28,840

1338
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:32,880
<i>Impact imminent.</i>

1339
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,360
Hands off!

1340
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:10,440
Oh, God.

1341
01:42:56,040 --> 01:42:57,040
NO. NO.

1342
01:42:57,160 --> 01:42:58,240
<i>NO.' NO.' NO.'</i>

1343
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:14,880
Oh, God.

1344

<i>Warning: You have two minutes</i>

<i>Warning: You have 30 seconds</i>

1346
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:38,080
<i>Airlock sealed.</i>

<i>Oxygen levels now stabilizing.</i>

1348
01:45:56,800 --> 01:45:58,640
Elizabeth, are you there?

1349
01:45:59,120 --> 01:46:00,280
<i>This is David.</i>

1350
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:03,880
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I'm here.

1351
01:46:04,120 --> 01:46:06,320
You need to get out immediately.

1352
01:46:06,600 --> 01:46:08,440
<i>He's coming for you.</i>

1353
01:46:08,640 --> 01:46:09,640
Who's coming?

1354
01:46:10,160 --> 01:46:11,280
<i>Airlock breach.</i>

1355
01:46:19,480 --> 01:46:20,480
me,

1356
01:47:42,520 --> 01:47:44,920
I'm so sorry.

1357
01:47:46,280 --> 01:47:48,120
Oh, God.

1358
01:47:48,680 --> 01:47:50,040
I'm sorry.

1359
01:47:50,160 --> 01:47:53,480
I'm sorry, Charlie, I can't do it.

1360
01:47:53,640 --> 01:47:56,680
I can't do it anymore.

1361
01:47:59,960 --> 01:48:01,360
<i>Elizabeth.</i>

1362
01:48:03,240 --> 01:48:04,400
<i>Are you there?</i>

1363
01:48:08,720 --> 01:48:10,200
<i>Dr. Shaw...</i>

1364
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:12,080
<i>...can you hear me?</i>

1365
01:48:13,280 --> 01:48:14,520
Yes.

1366
01:48:15,960 --> 01:48:18,040
<i>Yes, I can hear you.</i>

1367
01:48:18,520 --> 01:48:20,320
I was afraid you were dead.

1368
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,880
You have no idea what afraid is.

1369
01:48:25,640 --> 01:48:28,320
I know we've had our differences...

1370
01:48:29,680 --> 01:48:31,120
...but, please...

1371
01:48:31,960 --> 01:48:34,200
...I need to ask you for your help.

1372
01:48:34,280 --> 01:48:36,800
<i>Why the hell would I help you?</i>

1373
01:48:38,440 --> 01:48:42,200
Because, without me,
you'll never leave this place.

1374
01:48:42,840 --> 01:48:45,880
Neither one of us is leaving this place.

1375
01:48:46,280 --> 01:48:48,280
It's not the only ship.

1376
01:48:50,040 --> 01:48:52,080
<i>There are many others.</i>

1377
01:48:53,320 --> 01:48:54,640
I can operate them.

1378
01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:04,840
Dr. Shaw?

1379
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:18,280
Dr. Shaw!

1380
01:49:19,600 --> 01:49:20,720
Over here.

1381
01:49:26,200 --> 01:49:28,120
Where is my cross?

1382
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:30,360
The pouch in my utility belt.

1383
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:50,160
Even after all this...

1384
01:49:50,280 --> 01:49:52,280
...you still believe, don't you?

1385
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:55,960
You said you could
understand their navigation...

1386
01:49:56,440 --> 01:49:57,640
...use their maps.

1387
01:49:59,560 --> 01:50:01,240
Yes, of course.

1388
01:50:01,320 --> 01:50:03,600
Once we get
to one of their other ships...

1389
01:50:03,800 --> 01:50:06,800
...finding a path to Earth
should be relatively straightforward.

1390
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:10,280
I don't want to go back
to where we came from.

1391
01:50:12,040 --> 01:50:14,600
I want to go where they came from.

1392
01:50:15,960 --> 01:50:18,280
Do you think you can do that, David?

1393
01:50:21,960 --> 01:50:23,160
Yes.

1394
01:50:23,720 --> 01:50:25,520
I believe I can.

1395
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:37,040
May I ask what you hope to achieve
by going there?

1396
01:50:37,640 --> 01:50:39,640
They created us.

1397
01:50:39,880 --> 01:50:41,320
Then they tried to kill us.

1398
01:50:41,880 --> 01:50:43,680
They changed their minds.

1399
01:50:45,200 --> 01:50:46,840
I deserve to know why.

1400
01:50:48,920 --> 01:50:50,440
The answer is irrelevant.

1401
01:50:51,440 --> 01:50:53,640
Does it matter why
they changed their minds?

1402
01:50:54,280 --> 01:50:55,440
Yes.

1403
01:50:56,720 --> 01:50:58,320
Yes, it does.

1404
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:00,400
I don't understand.

1405
01:51:01,880 --> 01:51:02,960
Well...

1406
01:51:04,920 --> 01:51:07,840
...I guess that's because
I'm a human being...

1407
01:51:07,960 --> 01:51:09,360
...and you're a robot.

1408
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:19,720
I'm sorry.

1409
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:21,080
It's quite all right.

1410
01:51:35,600 --> 01:51:38,280
<i>Final report of the vessel Prometheus.</i>

1411
