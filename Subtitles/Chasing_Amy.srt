1
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:38,337
The seminar will begin in five minutes.

2
00:02:38,437 --> 00:02:40,529
It will be in room "C."

3
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:45,011
So, uh, how about Chow Yun Fat?

4
00:02:45,111 --> 00:02:48,431
I don't know.
I love Chow Yun Fat.

5
00:02:48,531 --> 00:02:50,704
- I just don't see him playing Madman.
- Awesome.

6
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:52,804
Thank you.

7
00:02:58,574 --> 00:03:02,829
Could you sign it:
"To a really big fan"?

8
00:03:04,664 --> 00:03:06,616
Uh, you bet.

9
00:03:06,716 --> 00:03:09,201
I love this book, man.
This shit is awesome!

10
00:03:09,301 --> 00:03:11,203
I wish I was like these guys.
Gettin' stoned,

11
00:03:11,303 --> 00:03:14,832
talkin' all raw about chicks
and fightin' supervillains!

12
00:03:14,932 --> 00:03:18,469
I love these guys! You know what.
They're like Bill and Ted...

13
00:03:18,936 --> 00:03:20,532
meet Cheech and Chong!

14
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,010
Yeah. I kind of
like to think of them...

15
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,421
as Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
meet Vladimir and Estragon.

16
00:03:25,525 --> 00:03:27,325
Yes! Who?

17
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:32,766
So, do you, like,
draw this or something?

18
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:38,190
I ink it, and I'm also the colorist.
The guy next to me draws it.

19
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,754
But we both came up
with the characters. Next!

20
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:42,255
What does that mean,
you "ink it"?

21
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:45,154
Well, it means that Holden
draws the pictures in pencil.

22
00:03:45,254 --> 00:03:48,136
And then he gives it to me
to go over in ink. Next!

23
00:03:48,236 --> 00:03:50,430
So, basically,
you just trace.

24
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:54,809
It's, uh, it's not tracing,
all right?

25
00:03:54,909 --> 00:03:57,771
I add depth and shading to give
the image more definition.

26
00:03:57,871 --> 00:04:00,690
Only then does the drawing
truly take shape.

27
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:06,008
No, no, no. You go over what he draws
with a pen, all right? That's tracing.

28
00:04:06,108 --> 00:04:08,957
Not really. Next.

29
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,891
Hey, man,
let me ask you somethin'.

30
00:04:13,991 --> 00:04:17,332
Somebody draws something
and then you draw the exact same thing,

31
00:04:17,432 --> 00:04:20,960
like, right on top of it without going
outside the original designated art.

32
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,004
What do you call that?

33
00:04:23,104 --> 00:04:25,674
- I don't know, man. Tracing?
- See?

34
00:04:25,774 --> 00:04:27,258
You want your book signed
or what?

35
00:04:27,358 --> 00:04:29,469
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

36
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:33,807
Don't get all testy just because you
got a problem with your station in life.

37
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:35,225
Oh, I'm secure
with what I do.

38
00:04:35,325 --> 00:04:38,395
Then just say it.
You're a tracer.

39
00:04:38,495 --> 00:04:39,688
How should I sign this?

40
00:04:39,788 --> 00:04:41,690
I don't want you
to sign it, man.

41
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,025
I want the guy who draws
Bluntman & Chronic to sign it.

42
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:47,696
- You're just the tracer.
- Tell him, little shaver.

43
00:04:47,796 --> 00:04:51,658
Who do I sign it to?

44
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:54,119
You fuckin' tracer!

45
00:04:54,219 --> 00:04:57,998
I'll trace a chalk line around
your dead fuckin' body, you fuck!

46
00:04:58,098 --> 00:05:00,000
Would you get him
outta here?

47
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:04,775
Hey, wait a second! He jumped me!
You fuckin' tracer!

48
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:07,111
Your mother's a tracer!

49
00:05:07,211 --> 00:05:09,155
Can I explain the audience
principle to you?

50
00:05:09,255 --> 00:05:11,317
If you assault and accost them,
then we have no audience.

51
00:05:11,417 --> 00:05:14,889
He started it,
fuckin' cock-knocker!

52
00:05:14,989 --> 00:05:18,644
He's lucky I didn't put
my pen through his thorax!

53
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:23,023
Need I remind you?
Curtain's in ten minutes. Okay?

54
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:26,145
The Word's Up: Minority
Voices in Comics panel discussion...

55
00:05:26,245 --> 00:05:28,897
- All right.
- is about to begin in room "F."

56
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:33,251
For years in this industry...

57
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:36,703
whenever an African-American
character, hero or villain,

58
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:40,492
was introduced, usually,
by white artists and writers,

59
00:05:40,884 --> 00:05:44,169
they got slapped
with racist names...

60
00:05:44,598 --> 00:05:46,721
that singled them out
as Negroes.

61
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,880
Now, my book...

62
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,953
White Hatin' Coon...

63
00:05:55,053 --> 00:05:57,121
don't have none
of that bullshit.

64
00:05:57,221 --> 00:06:00,229
The hero's name is Maleekwa,
a descendant from the black tribe...

65
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:03,294
that established
the first society on the planet,

66
00:06:03,394 --> 00:06:06,422
while you European motherfuckers
were still hidin' in caves and shit,

67
00:06:06,522 --> 00:06:08,883
all terrified of the sun.

68
00:06:08,983 --> 00:06:13,680
He's a strong role model that
a young black reader can look up to,

69
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:18,247
'cause I'm here to tell ya: The chickens
is comin' home to roost, y'all.

70
00:06:18,347 --> 00:06:22,480
The black man's no longer gonna play the
minstrel in comics and sci-fi fantasy.

71
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:27,464
We keepin' it real, and we gonna
get respect by any means necessary.

72
00:06:27,564 --> 00:06:30,905
Ah, come on!
That's a bunch of horseshit!

73
00:06:31,005 --> 00:06:33,700
Lando Calrissian
was a black guy, you know.

74
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,273
He got to fly the Millennium Falcon.
What's the matter with you?

75
00:06:36,373 --> 00:06:38,913
- Who said that?
- I did.

76
00:06:39,013 --> 00:06:43,293
Lando Calrissian is a positive role
model in science-fiction fantasy.

77
00:06:43,393 --> 00:06:46,421
Fuck Lando Calrissian!
Uncle Tom nigger!

78
00:06:46,521 --> 00:06:49,549
Always some white boy
gotta invoke the holy trilogy.

79
00:06:49,649 --> 00:06:54,950
Those movies are about how the
white man keeps the brother man down...

80
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:58,057
even in a galaxy
far, far away.

81
00:06:58,157 --> 00:07:02,020
Check this shit. You got
cracker farm boy Luke Skywalker...

82
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,105
Nazi poster boy...
blond hair, blue eyes...

83
00:07:04,205 --> 00:07:06,107
and then you got
Darth Vader.

84
00:07:06,207 --> 00:07:08,776
The blackest brother
in the galaxy, Nubian guy.

85
00:07:08,876 --> 00:07:12,455
- What's a Nubian?
- Shut the fuck up!

86
00:07:14,624 --> 00:07:17,952
Now, Vader, he's a spiritual
brother, you know.

87
00:07:18,052 --> 00:07:20,246
Down with the force
and all that good shit.

88
00:07:20,346 --> 00:07:23,583
Then this cracker, Skywalker,
gets his hands on a light saber,

89
00:07:23,683 --> 00:07:25,981
and the boy decides he's gonna
run the fuckin' universe.

90
00:07:26,081 --> 00:07:28,963
Gets a whole Klan
of whites together.

91
00:07:29,063 --> 00:07:32,091
And they gonna bust up
Vader's hood, the Death Star.

92
00:07:32,191 --> 00:07:34,093
Now, what the fuck
do you call that?

93
00:07:34,193 --> 00:07:37,480
- Intergalactic civil war?
- Gentrification!

94
00:07:39,357 --> 00:07:42,977
They gonna drive out
the black element...

95
00:07:43,077 --> 00:07:46,147
to make the galaxy
"safe" for white folks.

96
00:07:46,247 --> 00:07:49,838
And Jedi's the most
insulting installment!

97
00:07:49,938 --> 00:07:53,509
Because Vader's beautiful
black visage is sullied...

98
00:07:53,609 --> 00:07:58,681
when he pulls off his mask to reveal
a feeble, crusty, old white man.

99
00:07:58,781 --> 00:08:03,298
They're tryin' to tell us that deep
inside we all wants to be white!

100
00:08:04,799 --> 00:08:06,968
Well, isn't that true?

101
00:08:16,436 --> 00:08:17,595
Black rage!

102
00:08:17,695 --> 00:08:19,806
Black rage!
I'll kill any white folks...

103
00:08:19,906 --> 00:08:24,486
I lay my motherfuckin' eyes on!

104
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:52,672
"What's a Nubian?"
Bitch, you almost made me laugh.

105
00:08:52,772 --> 00:08:55,631
Man, what about you? You didn't tell
me you were gonna scream, "Black rage!"

106
00:08:55,731 --> 00:08:57,468
I nearly pissed myself.

107
00:08:57,568 --> 00:08:59,571
How do you manage to get away
with this all the time?

108
00:08:59,671 --> 00:09:02,206
I mean, shouldn't the cops be busting
your head open right about now?

109
00:09:02,306 --> 00:09:06,060
- Wrong coast.
- Well, this here, she full of blanks.

110
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:11,566
And, uh, Opiate gets all sorts
of legal clearances before I go on.

111
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:13,711
So your publisher actually
condones these theatrics?

112
00:09:13,811 --> 00:09:18,197
Condones? Honey, they insist. I need
to sell the image to sell the book.

113
00:09:18,297 --> 00:09:20,526
Would the audience still buy
the whole black rage angle...

114
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:24,370
if they found out the book
was written by a, a... you know.

115
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,956
- Faggot?
- When you say it, it sounds so sexy.

116
00:09:27,056 --> 00:09:32,086
Hey, hey, hey! I'll play your victim,
but not your catcher, all right?

117
00:09:32,186 --> 00:09:35,673
Hooper, how come you sound like Minister
Farrakhan when you're onstage...

118
00:09:35,773 --> 00:09:38,760
and the king of pop
when you're not?

119
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,762
Look out, boys!
This kitten has a whip!

120
00:09:40,862 --> 00:09:42,764
Always before
I get to speak, you dick.

121
00:09:42,864 --> 00:09:44,891
I swear! Jesus!

122
00:09:44,991 --> 00:09:47,831
The next con I attend, and they
ask me to be on the minority panel,

123
00:09:47,931 --> 00:09:51,731
if I see your name anywhere
near that list, I'm passing!

124
00:09:51,831 --> 00:09:55,902
Holden, Banky, this pile
of P.M.S. is Alyssa Jones.

125
00:09:56,002 --> 00:09:57,946
She does that book,
Idiosyncratic Routine.

126
00:09:58,046 --> 00:10:03,847
Oh, I've read your book. It's cute.
Chick stuff, but cute. What?

127
00:10:03,947 --> 00:10:06,318
Sorry about him. He's, uh,
he's dealing with being an inker.

128
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:08,915
Oh. You trace.

129
00:10:09,015 --> 00:10:14,379
I really like your book. I'm surprised
we never met at any other cons before.

130
00:10:14,479 --> 00:10:16,965
Yeah, well, lose the dick
or change the skin tone,

131
00:10:17,065 --> 00:10:20,051
and we can get to know
each other on panel after panel.

132
00:10:20,151 --> 00:10:24,472
These boys do Bluntman & Chronic, which
outsells both of our books put together.

133
00:10:24,572 --> 00:10:27,976
Hence, they're never on the panel
with the likes of us.

134
00:10:28,076 --> 00:10:29,778
They slummin' it right now.

135
00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:33,106
I promised Alyssa
I'd buy her a post-rave drink.

136
00:10:33,206 --> 00:10:35,516
Do the Garden Staters have
to sprint to the Lincoln Tunnel,

137
00:10:35,616 --> 00:10:38,361
or can you stay for a round
in the big, scary city?

138
00:10:38,461 --> 00:10:40,538
- We're gonna go...
- We'll take...

139
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:44,966
We'll go.

140
00:10:48,546 --> 00:10:50,477
Archie. All right?

141
00:10:50,577 --> 00:10:54,127
Archie and the Riverdale gang were
a pure and fun-lovin' bunch.

142
00:10:54,227 --> 00:10:58,089
You can't find dysfunction in those
comics. They were flat-out wholesome.

143
00:10:58,189 --> 00:11:00,988
- Archie and Jughead were lovers.
- Shut the fuck up!

144
00:11:01,088 --> 00:11:05,346
It's true. Archie was the bitch,
and Jughead was the butch.

145
00:11:05,446 --> 00:11:08,975
That's why Jughead wears
that crown-lookin' hat all the time.

146
00:11:09,075 --> 00:11:12,103
He the king of
Queen Archie's world.

147
00:11:12,203 --> 00:11:14,105
Man, I feel
a hate crime comin' on.

148
00:11:14,205 --> 00:11:16,503
Well, you know,
he does have a point.

149
00:11:16,603 --> 00:11:18,789
I mean, Archie never did quite
settle on Betty or Veronica.

150
00:11:18,889 --> 00:11:21,779
'Cause he wanted them both
at the same time, you assholes!

151
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:25,199
He didn't choose one, because he was
trying to get them into a three-way.

152
00:11:25,299 --> 00:11:28,299
- Here.
- What?

153
00:11:28,761 --> 00:11:32,665
I want you to go down to the corner
store and buy yourself a clue.

154
00:11:32,765 --> 00:11:35,168
- Go on.
- Eat it, Urkel.

155
00:11:35,268 --> 00:11:38,108
Uh! I done told you to
watch it with that Urkel shit.

156
00:11:38,253 --> 00:11:41,474
Face it, girl.
Archie's a sister.

157
00:11:44,524 --> 00:11:48,348
- That's it. You!
- Moi?

158
00:11:48,448 --> 00:11:52,268
Yeah, you. You are marching
back across the street with me,

159
00:11:52,368 --> 00:11:55,042
and we're gonna pick up
a shitload of Archie books.

160
00:11:55,142 --> 00:11:58,024
And I'm going to prove to you
beyond the shadow of a doubt...

161
00:11:58,124 --> 00:12:00,610
that Archie
is all about pussy.

162
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,310
Come on!

163
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:04,914
This boy is conflicted.

164
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,752
I shall play
mother therapist for him.

165
00:12:08,852 --> 00:12:12,097
You two sit tight.
We shall return promptly.

166
00:12:16,358 --> 00:12:17,803
Is he always like that?

167
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:21,140
Who, him? Yeah.
Ever since the third grade.

168
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,226
This, uh, this nun was teaching us
about the Blessed Trinity, you know?

169
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:27,312
She was going on and on about
the three persons in one God thing.

170
00:12:27,412 --> 00:12:29,440
Father, Son,
the Holy Spirit.

171
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:33,152
Banky just goes ballistic on her.
They got in this huge fight.

172
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:36,822
An eight-year-old kid?
How bad could it have been?

173
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,950
Well, have you ever seen a nun call
a small child a "fucking cunt-rag"?

174
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,995
It wasn't pretty.
Shit like that's bound to happen...

175
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:46,039
when you make a kid wear
a matching tie and slacks every day.

176
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:50,482
Right. And your parochial
school misadventures?

177
00:12:50,582 --> 00:12:54,319
Oh, mostly limited to
wine-tasting prior to mass.

178
00:12:54,419 --> 00:12:56,925
Turned me into a grade school
alcoholic altar boy though.

179
00:12:57,025 --> 00:12:59,213
Can't tell you how many mornings
after serious benders...

180
00:12:59,313 --> 00:13:01,555
I'd wake up next
to strange priests.

181
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:04,475
- Aren't you the sharp wit?
- Sharp? No.

182
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:07,519
I'm just a fan of
clergy-molestation humor.

183
00:13:07,619 --> 00:13:11,504
Probably why the extended family quit
inviting me to first communion parties.

184
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:17,446
- Tsk.
- You play darts?

185
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:21,428
Uh, not professionally.
You know, only in bars.

186
00:13:22,217 --> 00:13:24,369
I don't know.

187
00:13:24,469 --> 00:13:28,457
Maybe I should just sign one of those
exclusive deals like you guys.

188
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:30,459
Your new book seems
to be selling like mad.

189
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:35,255
Well, it all goes back to somethin'
my grandmother told me when I was a kid.

190
00:13:35,355 --> 00:13:39,635
"Holden," she said, "the big bucks
are in dick and fart jokes."

191
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:42,033
- She was a churchgoer.
- Oh!

192
00:13:42,133 --> 00:13:46,099
The cry from the heart of a real artist
trapped in commercial hell,

193
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:48,602
pitying his good fortune.

194
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:52,043
I'm sure you can dry your eyes
on all those fat checks you rake in.

195
00:13:52,143 --> 00:13:56,214
Oh, I'm sorry. What was that? Did I
detect a note of bitter envy in there?

196
00:13:56,314 --> 00:13:59,154
No, I'm happy my stuff
gets read at all.

197
00:13:59,254 --> 00:14:01,406
There's very little market
for hearts and flowers...

198
00:14:01,506 --> 00:14:05,619
in this spandex-clad, big pecs,
big tits, big guns field.

199
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:08,789
If I sell two issues,
I feel like John Grisham.

200
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:10,833
Well, it's all
about marketing.

201
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:15,921
Over- or under-weight guys that don't
get laid. They're our bread and butter.

202
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:19,237
People like those two outside
should be yours.

203
00:14:19,337 --> 00:14:22,240
And sadly, there are more
of our core audience.

204
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:25,910
Kind of gives you a charge though.
See two people like that in love.

205
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:28,288
And all over
Banky's car, no less.

206
00:14:28,388 --> 00:14:31,186
You know, that car's seeing more action
right now than it's seen in years.

207
00:14:31,286 --> 00:14:35,774
- Bubbly guy like that? It's
hard to figure out why. - Yeah.

208
00:14:35,874 --> 00:14:38,986
You gotta respect that kind of display
of affection. You know what I mean?

209
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:41,613
Sure, it's crazy.
It's rude. It's self-absorbed.

210
00:14:41,713 --> 00:14:44,929
But, uh, you know,
it's love.

211
00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:47,974
- It's not love.
- Oh, says you.

212
00:14:48,074 --> 00:14:51,039
That out there?
That's fleeting.

213
00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:54,251
- Fleeting?
- Mm-hmm. Well, I gotta split.

214
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:57,942
It was really nice meeting you.
Good luck with your book.

215
00:14:58,042 --> 00:15:02,851
Tell Hooper I'll call him later.
And... tell your friend to calm down.

216
00:15:08,524 --> 00:15:10,955
Shut up already.

217
00:15:11,055 --> 00:15:13,771
You shut up!
You're insane.

218
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:16,607
Archie is not fucking
Mr. Weatherbee!

219
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:20,107
Deny, deny, deny.

220
00:15:20,231 --> 00:15:24,198
- Where's Alyssa?
- She left, said she'd call you later.

221
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,930
Look, he's just offering to help Archie
with his fuckin' homework!

222
00:15:27,042 --> 00:15:29,307
Read between
the lines, bitch.

223
00:15:29,407 --> 00:15:32,685
Fuck this. Let's go.
Traffic.

224
00:15:33,837 --> 00:15:35,313
- Holden!
- What?

225
00:15:35,413 --> 00:15:39,139
- Let's go!
- See that dent in the hood of your car?

226
00:15:39,584 --> 00:15:41,390
Son of a bitch!

227
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:48,815
Let me guess.
You like her.

228
00:15:48,947 --> 00:15:51,358
- Who?
- Miss Alyssa Jones.

229
00:15:54,365 --> 00:15:57,907
- She's all right.
- As long as that's all.

230
00:16:22,567 --> 00:16:25,187
This is one of the best streetlights
you've ever drawn.

231
00:16:25,621 --> 00:16:27,498
It's the one from across the street
from the post office.

232
00:16:27,709 --> 00:16:29,953
- Looks just like it.
- Thanks.

233
00:16:31,418 --> 00:16:33,935
So, uh, what do you want
to do tonight?

234
00:16:34,409 --> 00:16:37,586
I don't know. Get a pizza.
Watch Degrassi Junior High.

235
00:16:37,752 --> 00:16:40,381
You got a weird thing
for Canadian melodrama.

236
00:16:40,481 --> 00:16:43,092
I got a weird thing
for girls who say "aboot."

237
00:16:43,192 --> 00:16:45,592
Bank Holdup.

238
00:16:47,613 --> 00:16:52,664
Hooper here. Listen, I know how
you 'burb fiends hate the city,

239
00:16:52,764 --> 00:16:56,146
but there's a club shindig goin' down
tonight I think you'd really get into.

240
00:16:56,246 --> 00:17:00,508
- Where is it?
- Meow Mix. I'm temping as barkeep.

241
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,278
Oh, I don't know, Hoop.

242
00:17:03,378 --> 00:17:06,219
We're prepping the next issue. We got
that stupid meeting in the morning.

243
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,210
- I told her you wouldn't be interested.
- Told who?

244
00:17:10,503 --> 00:17:11,903
Alyssa.

245
00:17:12,803 --> 00:17:14,248
Alyssa from last night Alyssa?

246
00:17:14,348 --> 00:17:16,800
How do you begin and end a question
with the same word like that?

247
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,034
You got skill.
Yes, that one!

248
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:22,123
She asked me to invite you.
Now, here's the part where you say...

249
00:17:22,223 --> 00:17:26,465
- I'll be there.
- Thought so. 10:00. Later.

250
00:17:27,823 --> 00:17:32,771
- Who was that?
- Hooper. He invited me to a club.

251
00:17:33,476 --> 00:17:36,483
Man, when's that faggot gonna learn?
You like chicks.

252
00:17:36,715 --> 00:17:39,896
- Not that kind of club.
- So when we leavin'?

253
00:17:40,655 --> 00:17:43,824
We? You can't go.
He's hookin' me up with Alyssa.

254
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:47,286
- And?
- And I don't want you messing it up.

255
00:17:47,959 --> 00:17:50,748
I care about your shit.
Maybe I'll hook up myself.

256
00:17:50,848 --> 00:17:53,134
I told you. It's not
that kind of club.

257
00:17:54,218 --> 00:17:56,834
How does one man
get to be so funny?

258
00:17:56,999 --> 00:18:01,269
Look, how you gonna get
home when I hook up, huh?

259
00:18:01,476 --> 00:18:06,076
- Like that'll happen.
- Let me explain, my witless chum.

260
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:08,528
The other night, we two,
Alyssa and I,

261
00:18:08,628 --> 00:18:11,030
we, uh, well,
we shared a moment.

262
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:14,367
- Oh, you had a moment.
- No.

263
00:18:14,467 --> 00:18:17,182
We shared a moment,
all right?

264
00:18:17,282 --> 00:18:22,688
And in that moment, one thing
was made abundantly clear.

265
00:18:22,788 --> 00:18:26,191
This girl loves me,
my friend.

266
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:29,987
Loves me. You know
what I'm sayin'?

267
00:18:30,087 --> 00:18:32,531
Ah, who's your daddy now

268
00:18:32,631 --> 00:18:34,888
Come on. Mmm.

269
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,890
- Ah
- Shut up!

270
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,756
It's your birthday
It's your birthday

271
00:18:40,923 --> 00:18:45,273
Go, Sheila, it's your birthday
Go, Sheila, it's your birthday

272
00:18:45,373 --> 00:18:48,589
All right.
Bring on the free hootch.

273
00:18:48,689 --> 00:18:52,259
Free? I didn't invite your tired ass.
So, where's your better half?

274
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:55,429
Takin' a piss. The guy's got
a bladder like an infant.

275
00:18:55,529 --> 00:18:58,307
That's funny. He says
you're hung like an infant.

276
00:18:58,407 --> 00:19:01,080
Does his mother
tell him everything?

277
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,896
- Hey!
- What'd you do, fall in love?

278
00:19:03,996 --> 00:19:05,990
- Where is she?
- Over there.

279
00:19:06,115 --> 00:19:11,153
Look at her in her net shirt. Been
dancin' for an hour. Hasn't stopped yet.

280
00:19:11,253 --> 00:19:14,198
She ain't no Deney Terrio,
I'll say that.

281
00:19:14,298 --> 00:19:18,223
Listen, if I'm not back by Tuesday,
call my mother. All right?

282
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:21,955
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
There's somethin' you should know.

283
00:19:22,055 --> 00:19:24,687
- She got a boyfriend?
- Well, no.

284
00:19:24,787 --> 00:19:29,096
Then what's to know, my friend?
What's to know?

285
00:19:38,439 --> 00:19:41,308
Hey, lady! You fucked up
my cabbage patch!

286
00:19:41,408 --> 00:19:45,896
Well, well, well, if it isn't Bluntman
himself, or should I call you Chronic?

287
00:19:45,996 --> 00:19:50,108
Call me flattered. I heard you sent me
the invite to this little soiree.

288
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:53,862
From a former hometown girl
to Mr. Hometown himself.

289
00:19:53,962 --> 00:19:56,553
- You're saying you're from the 'burbs?
- Middletown, New Jersey

290
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:59,931
- Get outta here! I'm from Highlands!
- I know. Hooper told me.

291
00:20:00,031 --> 00:20:01,933
How is it that we never
ran into one another?

292
00:20:02,033 --> 00:20:03,935
- Did you graduate from Hudson?
- Yeah, '88.

293
00:20:04,035 --> 00:20:07,063
- I went to North.
- What a small fuckin' world.

294
00:20:07,163 --> 00:20:09,440
- So you know the tri-town area?
- Quiz me.

295
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,505
- Miller Hill?
- I wrote my name on the wall.

296
00:20:11,605 --> 00:20:14,237
- Sandy Hook?
- Lost my virginity there.

297
00:20:14,337 --> 00:20:17,636
- This is so cool. The mall?
- Eton preppy or Menlo Park?

298
00:20:17,736 --> 00:20:20,973
Oh, no. Here's the big test.
Quick Stop?

299
00:20:21,073 --> 00:20:23,955
My best friend fucked
a dead guy in the bathroom.

300
00:20:24,055 --> 00:20:27,112
- You know that girl?
- I did, before she was committed.

301
00:20:29,865 --> 00:20:33,152
There's a lot of chicks
in this place.

302
00:20:33,252 --> 00:20:37,281
Chicks? You're such a man.

303
00:20:37,381 --> 00:20:40,325
You know what this is?
This is fate.

304
00:20:40,425 --> 00:20:44,580
No, this is "The Rog."

305
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,207
I'm talking about us meeting.
What are the chances?

306
00:20:47,307 --> 00:20:50,982
Pretty slim. I haven't been back
to the 'burbs since my friend's funeral.

307
00:20:51,082 --> 00:20:53,964
- The Quick Stop girl died?
- Uh-uh. Another girl.

308
00:20:54,064 --> 00:20:56,592
- Julie Dwyer. She died in the...
- The YMCA pool! Damn!

309
00:20:56,692 --> 00:20:58,927
- You knew her too?
- So well.

310
00:20:59,027 --> 00:21:02,389
Wow! One friend in the asylum,
the other friend in the grave.

311
00:21:02,489 --> 00:21:05,401
- You're a dangerous person to know.
- Ah, but I can tap.

312
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:10,397
- That's the Buffalo two-step.
- Yeah, well, it's very solid.

313
00:21:10,497 --> 00:21:13,338
That's what six years
of tap lessons yields.

314
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:16,737
Two towns away from each other
for years, we had to meet in New York.

315
00:21:16,837 --> 00:21:20,332
Could have been worse.
Could have not met at all.

316
00:21:25,963 --> 00:21:28,832
Okay, we're back.

317
00:21:28,932 --> 00:21:31,001
Thank you. Thank you.

318
00:21:31,101 --> 00:21:34,087
So, a long time ago, we used
to have this bass player,

319
00:21:34,187 --> 00:21:37,508
who took off one day to draw
funny books or something.

320
00:21:37,608 --> 00:21:40,686
Maybe you've heard of her stuff?
Idiosyncratic Routine?

321
00:21:44,148 --> 00:21:46,391
But what a lot of people
don't know...

322
00:21:46,491 --> 00:21:49,394
is that she used to harbor
these delusions that she could sing,

323
00:21:49,494 --> 00:21:53,532
and she used to subject us to throaty
renditions of Debbie Gibson tunes.

324
00:21:55,951 --> 00:21:59,488
So, she's here tonight,
and I think if we all beg her...

325
00:21:59,588 --> 00:22:02,220
or maybe offer her
some "X,"

326
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,868
she'll come up here and treat us
to some of her vocal stylings.

327
00:22:04,968 --> 00:22:06,870
What do ya say, Alyssa?

328
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:07,970
Yeah!

329
00:22:09,994 --> 00:22:12,794
Oh, she's shy!

330
00:22:14,242 --> 00:22:16,547
Get up here and sing, bitch!

331
00:22:16,647 --> 00:22:20,405
All right!
Go. Go up there.

332
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:21,505
Whoo!

333
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,507
Whoo! Yea!

334
00:22:27,817 --> 00:22:31,403
What am I doing here?
This is so fucking gay.

335
00:22:35,115 --> 00:22:37,410
She is such a cunt.

336
00:22:38,834 --> 00:22:42,073
You guys know the one
I wanna do, right?

337
00:22:43,069 --> 00:22:46,168
All right. I should
dedicate this, right?

338
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:52,141
This is for that
someone special out there.

339
00:22:53,069 --> 00:22:54,204
Ready?

340
00:22:55,091 --> 00:22:58,251
I'm feelin' awful

341
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:02,144
But all alone

342
00:23:02,985 --> 00:23:06,985
Just missin' someone

343
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:10,952
I don't even know

344
00:23:11,368 --> 00:23:14,959
But until I find him

345
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:18,859
I'll wait patiently

346
00:23:19,042 --> 00:23:23,042
Just feelin' nothin'

347
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,280
Inside of me

348
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:30,621
And where are you, baby

349
00:23:30,721 --> 00:23:33,624
Where can you be

350
00:23:33,724 --> 00:23:37,524
Why aren't you here

351
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,320
Lovin' me

352
00:23:41,607 --> 00:23:45,302
'Cause I want to kiss you

353
00:23:45,402 --> 00:23:49,389
And make you feel right

354
00:23:49,489 --> 00:23:52,997
I want to lay with you

355
00:23:53,097 --> 00:23:56,334
All through the night

356
00:23:56,434 --> 00:24:00,171
And I wanna feel passion
I wanna feel pain

357
00:24:00,271 --> 00:24:03,821
I wanna weep at
the sound of your name

358
00:24:03,921 --> 00:24:07,366
Come make me laugh
or come make me cry

359
00:24:07,466 --> 00:24:12,066
Just make me feel alive

360
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:17,652
And so I'll wait

361
00:24:18,227 --> 00:24:21,755
For that glorious day

362
00:24:21,855 --> 00:24:25,008
When the one I dream of

363
00:24:25,108 --> 00:24:27,508
Comes my way

364
00:24:29,655 --> 00:24:33,142
And when our lips touch

365
00:24:33,242 --> 00:24:35,442
So tenderly

366
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:41,316
I know I'll feel
somethin'

367
00:24:41,416 --> 00:24:43,816
Inside of me

368
00:24:47,256 --> 00:24:51,493
I wanna feel passion
I wanna feel pain

369
00:24:51,593 --> 00:24:55,080
I wanna weep at
the sound of your name

370
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:58,542
Come make me laugh
or come make me cry

371
00:24:58,642 --> 00:25:02,042
Just make me feel

372
00:25:02,938 --> 00:25:03,938
Alive

373
00:25:09,151 --> 00:25:11,351
Yeah! Whoo!

374
00:25:15,422 --> 00:25:16,422
Whoo!

375
00:26:04,648 --> 00:26:05,648
Hot!

376
00:26:09,909 --> 00:26:14,543
Now, that, my friend,
is a shared moment.

377
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,493
- What?
- It's rude.

378
00:26:32,593 --> 00:26:36,543
When are we gonna get a chance to see
this shit live without payin' for it?

379
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:42,753
- Sorry. It's just new to him.
- Oh, and you're an old hand at this?

380
00:26:42,853 --> 00:26:47,883
No, no, I should apologize. I don't
normally get all mushy in public,

381
00:26:47,983 --> 00:26:51,011
but it's been a while
since I've seen Kim here.

382
00:26:51,111 --> 00:26:53,430
You know what?
I wanna dance.

383
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:55,849
Go ahead.
I'll watch from here.

384
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:58,989
No!
I wanna dance with you!

385
00:26:59,175 --> 00:27:03,115
Don't be a rag. I have to sit here and
work up the desire to fuck you later.

386
00:27:05,591 --> 00:27:06,991
Please!

387
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,700
Yes?

388
00:27:13,885 --> 00:27:15,820
You said "fuck."
She said "fuck."

389
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,231
You said "fuck" to that girl.
You said that you'd fuck her.

390
00:27:18,331 --> 00:27:21,013
- And?
- How can a girl fuck another girl?

391
00:27:21,113 --> 00:27:23,015
Were you talking about
strap-ons or something?

392
00:27:23,115 --> 00:27:25,017
- Oh, Jesus. Would you shut up?
- What?

393
00:27:25,117 --> 00:27:26,498
It's okay.

394
00:27:26,598 --> 00:27:29,355
I don't know how many times
I can apologize for him.

395
00:27:29,455 --> 00:27:33,004
No, Banky, I've never
used a strap-on.

396
00:27:33,104 --> 00:27:35,006
Then what's with
saying "fuck"?

397
00:27:35,106 --> 00:27:39,699
Shouldn't you say "eat her out" or
modify the term "fuck" with "fist"?

398
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:44,419
Let me ask you a question.
Can men fuck each other?

399
00:27:44,666 --> 00:27:48,607
- You asking for my permission?
- In your estimation.

400
00:27:49,183 --> 00:27:50,183
Sure.

401
00:27:50,283 --> 00:27:53,650
So, for you,
to fuck is to penetrate.

402
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:56,611
You're used to the more
traditional definition.

403
00:27:56,711 --> 00:28:00,386
You, inside some girl you've
duped, jackhammerin' away,

404
00:28:00,486 --> 00:28:02,430
not noticing that
bored look in her eyes.

405
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:07,080
Hey, I always notice that bored look
in their eyes, all right?

406
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:10,625
Fucking is not limited
to penetration, Banky.

407
00:28:10,725 --> 00:28:15,130
For me, it describes any sex
when it's not totally about love.

408
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:18,112
I don't love Kim,
but I'll fuck her.

409
00:28:18,212 --> 00:28:20,134
I'm sure you don't love
every girl you sleep with.

410
00:28:20,234 --> 00:28:22,262
Some of them
I downright loathe.

411
00:28:22,362 --> 00:28:25,745
Aha, but I'll bet it's different
with the ones you do love.

412
00:28:25,845 --> 00:28:27,747
Like, you'll go down
on 'em longer.

413
00:28:27,847 --> 00:28:29,415
- Here we go.
- I don't do that.

414
00:28:29,515 --> 00:28:32,689
- What?
- I stopped. It got to be frustrating.

415
00:28:32,789 --> 00:28:36,401
As stupid as you usually come off
during this little diatribe of yours,

416
00:28:36,501 --> 00:28:38,708
you're gonna come off ten times
as stupid on this occasion.

417
00:28:38,808 --> 00:28:41,594
I lost my tolerance for the baggage
that comes with eating girls out.

418
00:28:41,694 --> 00:28:43,596
What's the big deal?

419
00:28:43,696 --> 00:28:46,432
If you say the smell,
so help me, I will slug you.

420
00:28:46,532 --> 00:28:48,538
Not the smell.
The smell is good.

421
00:28:48,638 --> 00:28:51,270
I'm talkin' about not being
able to do it properly.

422
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:53,272
My mother
brought me up to believe...

423
00:28:53,372 --> 00:28:56,087
if I can't do something right,
I shouldn't do it at all.

424
00:28:56,187 --> 00:28:59,674
Of course, my father told me she gave
lousy head, but that's beside the point.

425
00:28:59,774 --> 00:29:03,178
Well, at least you blame yourself
for your sexual inadequacies.

426
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:05,472
No. I blame them.

427
00:29:05,572 --> 00:29:10,289
Chicks never help you out.
They never tell you what to do, right?

428
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:13,980
And most of them are all self-conscious
about the smell factor.

429
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,527
And, so, most of the time, they just lay
there frozen like a deer in headlights.

430
00:29:18,627 --> 00:29:21,238
I mean, not for nothin',
but when a chick goes down on me,

431
00:29:21,338 --> 00:29:24,407
I let her know where to go
and what the status is.

432
00:29:24,507 --> 00:29:27,594
You gotta handle it like
CNN and the Weather Channel.

433
00:29:28,595 --> 00:29:30,705
Constant updates.

434
00:29:30,805 --> 00:29:32,958
You are such an idiot.

435
00:29:33,058 --> 00:29:36,482
No, no, he's got a point.
I mean, that's how I was in high school.

436
00:29:36,582 --> 00:29:40,173
You know, all nervous and
inhibited about being eaten out.

437
00:29:40,273 --> 00:29:43,718
But by the time I got
to college, that all changed.

438
00:29:43,818 --> 00:29:45,887
I've loosened up.

439
00:29:45,987 --> 00:29:48,642
I was like one of those guys at
the airport with those big flashlights,

440
00:29:48,742 --> 00:29:52,498
wavin' 'em this way, directin' 'em
that way, tellin' 'em when to stop.

441
00:29:52,598 --> 00:29:56,022
And that's all I'm sayin'. It would
be different if chicks helped out.

442
00:29:56,122 --> 00:29:58,546
You know, pointed a guy
in the right direction.

443
00:29:58,646 --> 00:30:04,051
There'd be no bullshit, no wasted time
and no chance for permanent injuries.

444
00:30:04,358 --> 00:30:06,053
Permanent injuries?

445
00:30:06,153 --> 00:30:09,351
Sure. You wanna see
somethin' permanent?

446
00:30:09,803 --> 00:30:11,913
- See that?
- Uh-huh.

447
00:30:12,013 --> 00:30:14,749
I got that from Nina Rollins,
sophomore year.

448
00:30:14,849 --> 00:30:16,751
I'm goin' down on her,
right?

449
00:30:16,851 --> 00:30:19,066
Out of nowhere, her cat jumps on her.

450
00:30:19,166 --> 00:30:24,530
She does this big pelvic thrust, cracks
my tooth and sends it down my throat.

451
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:27,604
I had to get a crown
for the stub.

452
00:30:28,939 --> 00:30:32,038
I got that beat.
I got that beat.

453
00:30:32,138 --> 00:30:36,980
Junior year, I'm goin' down
on Cynthia Slater in her dorm room.

454
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:42,256
I'm totally drunk, and in the middle
of it, I fall asleep right in her lap.

455
00:30:42,356 --> 00:30:44,258
She got so mad,
she digs her heel into my back.

456
00:30:44,358 --> 00:30:48,617
- Ow!
- Right there. That's permanent.

457
00:30:48,717 --> 00:30:52,421
All right. All right.
See this?

458
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:56,938
That's the farthest I can
move my neck to the right.

459
00:30:57,038 --> 00:31:01,129
Again, sophomore year,
I'm goin' out with Brandy Svining.

460
00:31:01,229 --> 00:31:05,008
And for six months, I'm goin' down
on her. Not a damn thing's happening.

461
00:31:05,108 --> 00:31:08,783
So, one night, I change a position
or vary my lapping speed,

462
00:31:08,883 --> 00:31:13,058
and suddenly it's
a whole new world.

463
00:31:13,158 --> 00:31:16,082
She's movin' around,
convulsing, breathing heavy,

464
00:31:16,182 --> 00:31:18,793
and her legs are pressed up
against my ears so tightly...

465
00:31:18,893 --> 00:31:22,755
that I don't hear her father
come into the room.

466
00:31:22,855 --> 00:31:25,954
He grabs my hair and
pulls me way back, hard.

467
00:31:30,709 --> 00:31:33,504
Senior year,
spring formal.

468
00:31:33,814 --> 00:31:36,640
I'm eatin' out Missy Kurt
in her brother's car.

469
00:31:36,826 --> 00:31:41,378
She's layin' across the backseat. I'm
half hangin' out, knees on the ground.

470
00:31:41,478 --> 00:31:46,320
She's flailin' around, and she...
she knocks the parking brake off.

471
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:50,804
The car starts
rolling down the hill.

472
00:31:50,904 --> 00:31:54,015
And my left knee
is cut up to shit...

473
00:31:54,115 --> 00:31:59,696
like a kiddy's scissors class
cut it up for paper dolls!

474
00:32:15,674 --> 00:32:16,872
Whoa! Hey!
Look at the time.

475
00:32:16,972 --> 00:32:18,874
We gotta... We gotta
beat that traffic, huh?

476
00:32:18,974 --> 00:32:21,188
What traffic?
It's 1:30 in the morning.

477
00:32:21,288 --> 00:32:24,587
And rush hour
starts in six hours. Let's go.

478
00:32:25,309 --> 00:32:29,176
Uh, thanks for inviting us out.
It was educational.

479
00:32:29,724 --> 00:32:30,876
Come on.

480
00:32:36,965 --> 00:32:38,268
Since you like
chicks, right,

481
00:32:38,368 --> 00:32:41,029
you just look at yourself naked
in the mirror all the time?

482
00:32:50,458 --> 00:32:52,220
Look, here's the deal.

483
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,812
When we get in there, don't be a
complete Potzer, like last night.

484
00:32:54,912 --> 00:32:56,724
This is business now, okay?

485
00:32:56,824 --> 00:33:01,124
Oh, why are you in such a bad mood?
Still dwelling on that dyke?

486
00:33:01,224 --> 00:33:03,335
- Hey, knock it off, will you?
- What'd I tell you?

487
00:33:03,435 --> 00:33:05,921
She just needs
the right guy.

488
00:33:06,021 --> 00:33:10,842
All every woman really wants
is some serious deep-dicking.

489
00:33:10,942 --> 00:33:12,142
Sorry.

490
00:33:16,308 --> 00:33:18,955
See, that's why
I can't buy lesbians.

491
00:33:19,055 --> 00:33:21,228
Everyone needs dick.

492
00:33:21,328 --> 00:33:23,918
See, I can buy fags,
a bunch of guys that need dick.

493
00:33:24,018 --> 00:33:26,858
You know, just plain need it.
That I get.

494
00:33:26,958 --> 00:33:30,758
Dykes?
Bullshit posturing.

495
00:33:30,858 --> 00:33:33,198
But, live and let live,
I guess.

496
00:33:33,298 --> 00:33:36,097
I'm sure the gay community
appreciates your support.

497
00:33:36,753 --> 00:33:40,101
We'd like to start off by saying that it
is a real pleasure to finally meet you.

498
00:33:40,201 --> 00:33:42,436
Absolute pleasure.

499
00:33:42,536 --> 00:33:45,498
One of the reasons we started this whole
thing was to finally meet the guys...

500
00:33:45,598 --> 00:33:47,796
that do Bluntman & Chronic.

501
00:33:47,896 --> 00:33:49,819
- Snootchie bootchies!
- Huh?

502
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,260
Which now brings us
to our proposal.

503
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,012
Look, fellas, the days
of Butt-Head are over.

504
00:33:56,112 --> 00:34:00,767
We're interested in doing 12 half-hour
Bluntman & Chronic cartoons.

505
00:34:01,985 --> 00:34:03,182
What do you say?

506
00:34:03,347 --> 00:34:04,832
Are we in business?

507
00:34:09,825 --> 00:34:11,789
The boy wonder.

508
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:16,585
Batman and Robin, the dynamic
duo against crime and corruption.

509
00:34:16,685 --> 00:34:19,567
Yeah, hi. Somebody told me
they make comic books here,

510
00:34:19,667 --> 00:34:23,258
which is so weird, because I have
this great idea for a story.

511
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:26,553
It's about a guy who comes
to this club and...

512
00:34:26,653 --> 00:34:28,722
hightails it
when he finds out...

513
00:34:28,822 --> 00:34:30,399
Ready for this?

514
00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:35,446
This girl is gay.

515
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:40,998
Any interest
in a story like that?

516
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,821
- An animated series?
- Twelve episodes.

517
00:34:43,921 --> 00:34:47,283
- Well, that's great, isn't it?
- Banky seems to think so.

518
00:34:47,383 --> 00:34:49,910
- But you don't.
- Well, I...

519
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:52,955
I don't know if that's the perception
I want people to have of our work.

520
00:34:53,055 --> 00:34:55,124
I know this sounds pretentious
as hell, but...

521
00:34:55,224 --> 00:34:57,334
I'd like to think of us
as artists, you know?

522
00:34:57,434 --> 00:35:00,442
I'd like to get back to doing something
more personal, like our first book.

523
00:35:00,542 --> 00:35:02,454
Well, when are you
gonna do that?

524
00:35:04,045 --> 00:35:05,941
When we have something
personal to say.

525
00:35:07,921 --> 00:35:09,972
I weirded you out
the other night.

526
00:35:10,438 --> 00:35:12,808
Uh, no, not really.

527
00:35:12,908 --> 00:35:15,575
- Oh, come on!
- Well, it's just...

528
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:18,343
I'd never seen that kind of thing
up close and personal before.

529
00:35:18,443 --> 00:35:20,232
It just took a while
to process.

530
00:35:20,775 --> 00:35:22,318
You wanna talk about it?

531
00:35:23,374 --> 00:35:24,486
If you want to.

532
00:35:25,272 --> 00:35:27,108
I like you, Holden.

533
00:35:27,464 --> 00:35:29,742
I haven't liked a man
in a long time.

534
00:35:29,842 --> 00:35:34,476
And it's not because I'm a man-hater
or something like that.

535
00:35:34,576 --> 00:35:38,167
It's just been some time since I've
been exposed to a man that didn't...

536
00:35:38,267 --> 00:35:41,795
immediately live into
a stereotype of some sort.

537
00:35:41,895 --> 00:35:44,486
And I want you to feel
comfortable with me,

538
00:35:44,586 --> 00:35:47,368
because I'd really like us
to be friends.

539
00:35:47,651 --> 00:35:50,834
So if there's anything you
wanna know, it's okay to ask me.

540
00:35:51,927 --> 00:35:54,329
- Okay.
- Okay.

541
00:35:54,429 --> 00:35:57,629
Okay. Why girls?

542
00:35:59,405 --> 00:36:02,408
- Why men?
- Well, because that's the standard.

543
00:36:02,708 --> 00:36:05,694
If that's the only reason
you're attracted to women...

544
00:36:05,794 --> 00:36:07,842
No, it's more than that.

545
00:36:07,942 --> 00:36:10,032
So you've never been
curious about men?

546
00:36:10,132 --> 00:36:14,557
Curious? Well, I always wondered
why my father watched Hee Haw, but...

547
00:36:14,657 --> 00:36:16,851
- You know what I mean.
- No.

548
00:36:16,951 --> 00:36:18,853
- Why not?
- No interest.

549
00:36:18,953 --> 00:36:21,690
- Because?
- Girls feel right.

550
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:26,069
Well, that's how I feel. You know,
I've never really been attracted to men.

551
00:36:26,169 --> 00:36:29,698
- Well, so, you're still a virgin then?
- No.

552
00:36:29,798 --> 00:36:31,700
But you've only
been with girls.

553
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,702
So you're saying
a person is a virgin...

554
00:36:33,802 --> 00:36:36,746
until they've had intercourse
with a member of the opposite sex.

555
00:36:36,846 --> 00:36:39,144
Isn't that
the standard definition?

556
00:36:39,244 --> 00:36:41,355
Again with your standards.

557
00:36:41,455 --> 00:36:44,817
I think virginity is lost
when you make love for the first time.

558
00:36:44,917 --> 00:36:47,695
- With a member of the opposite sex.
- Why? Why only then?

559
00:36:47,795 --> 00:36:50,333
Because that's the standard.
What do you want me to tell ya?

560
00:36:51,819 --> 00:36:55,035
So if a virgin is raped,
then she's still a virgin?

561
00:36:55,135 --> 00:36:57,579
- No, of course not.
- But rape is not the standard.

562
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:00,937
So she's had sex, but not
the standard idea of sex.

563
00:37:01,037 --> 00:37:03,836
Hence, according to your definition,
she'd still be a virgin.

564
00:37:03,936 --> 00:37:06,714
- Okay, fine, I'll revise.
- Uh-huh.

565
00:37:06,814 --> 00:37:09,883
Virginity is
lost when the hymen is broken.

566
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:13,178
- Then I lost my virginity at ten.
- Really?

567
00:37:13,278 --> 00:37:16,849
'Cause, see, I fell on a fence post
when I was ten, and it broke my hymen.

568
00:37:16,949 --> 00:37:19,977
Okay. Second revision.

569
00:37:20,077 --> 00:37:22,688
Virginity is lost
through penetration.

570
00:37:22,788 --> 00:37:25,128
Physical penetration
or emotional.

571
00:37:25,228 --> 00:37:27,130
- Emotional penetration?
- Mmm.

572
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:30,279
I fell in love hard with Caitlin Bree
when we were in high school.

573
00:37:30,379 --> 00:37:31,447
Physical penetration.

574
00:37:31,547 --> 00:37:34,208
- We had sex.
- Yeah, but not real sex.

575
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:39,288
I move to have that remark
stricken from the record,

576
00:37:39,388 --> 00:37:43,459
on account of it makes you come off
as completely naive and infantile.

577
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:46,754
Well, where's the penetration
in lesbian sex? I...

578
00:37:46,854 --> 00:37:51,392
A finger? I've had my finger up my
ass. I wouldn't say I've had anal sex.

579
00:37:53,477 --> 00:37:55,077
Observe.

580
00:37:58,482 --> 00:38:03,228
You're kidding me!
How?

581
00:38:03,328 --> 00:38:05,981
Our bodies are built to pass
a child, for Christ's sake.

582
00:38:06,081 --> 00:38:08,567
Yeah, but I mean... Jesus!
Doesn't that hurt?

583
00:38:08,667 --> 00:38:11,946
- Sure, but in that good way.
- Oh.

584
00:38:12,046 --> 00:38:16,075
And it's only a once-in-a-while thing
reserved for really special occasions.

585
00:38:16,175 --> 00:38:20,245
- How about not-so-special occasions?
- Tongue only.

586
00:38:20,345 --> 00:38:23,582
Well, but see... Come on.
That's what I'm sayin'.

587
00:38:23,682 --> 00:38:26,927
It's like, how can that be enough?
How big can a tongue really get?

588
00:38:30,931 --> 00:38:32,331
My God.

589
00:38:32,941 --> 00:38:34,741
Let's go.

590
00:38:40,107 --> 00:38:42,372
Come on. Come on.

591
00:38:42,472 --> 00:38:44,945
You're really gonna have
to give me a minute, I think.

592
00:38:45,071 --> 00:38:47,877
Would you stop futzing with
your fuckin' bag? We're late already.

593
00:38:47,977 --> 00:38:50,205
- I have to get something.
- Look, man, we miss this train,

594
00:38:50,305 --> 00:38:53,737
I'm gonna shitcan you
and just hire Charles Schulz.

595
00:38:53,837 --> 00:38:57,116
Oh, my God. Who are you?
Larry Fucking Flynt?

596
00:38:57,216 --> 00:38:59,827
- What are you gonna do with all those?
- Read the articles.

597
00:38:59,927 --> 00:39:03,747
What do you think I'm gonna do
with 'em? They're stroke books, stupid.

598
00:39:03,847 --> 00:39:06,834
You got, like, 30 books in there.
We're only gonna be gone for two days.

599
00:39:06,934 --> 00:39:09,733
Variety is the spice of life.
I like a wide selection.

600
00:39:09,833 --> 00:39:12,068
Sometimes I'm in the mood
for nasty close-ups.

601
00:39:12,168 --> 00:39:14,425
Sometimes I like 'em
arty and airbrushed.

602
00:39:14,525 --> 00:39:16,760
Sometimes it's a spread
brown-eye kind of night.

603
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:19,242
Sometimes it's girl-on-girl time.

604
00:39:19,342 --> 00:39:21,244
Sometimes
a steamy letter will do.

605
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:24,247
Sometimes, not often,
but sometimes...

606
00:39:24,347 --> 00:39:28,585
I like the idea
of a chick with a horse.

607
00:39:28,685 --> 00:39:31,150
Go get our tickets.
I gotta call Alyssa.

608
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:33,994
- His master's voice.
- Put that stuff away!

609
00:39:43,337 --> 00:39:44,337
Hi.

610
00:40:02,523 --> 00:40:06,936
One minute, five seconds.
Ah, you are such my bitch.

611
00:40:07,036 --> 00:40:08,938
What's up?
I'm about to get on a train.

612
00:40:09,038 --> 00:40:12,191
- Oh! Why?
- Last-minute invite to the Boston Con.

613
00:40:12,291 --> 00:40:15,291
- Shit.
- What?

614
00:40:16,211 --> 00:40:18,822
Well, my sister's at my parents',
and I was gonna go see her.

615
00:40:18,922 --> 00:40:20,845
- The one that wrote the book?
- Yeah.

616
00:40:20,945 --> 00:40:25,475
But I was stayin' all weekend. I
wanted to hang out with you. This sucks.

617
00:40:25,575 --> 00:40:29,792
You know, um, both of us
don't have to go.

618
00:40:29,892 --> 00:40:31,815
- Really?
- Yeah. Banky can do this by himself.

619
00:40:31,915 --> 00:40:35,103
I mean, you know, it's not like we're on
a panel. It's just a signing appearance.

620
00:40:35,203 --> 00:40:37,925
If you come pick me up,
I'll be your best friend.

621
00:40:38,924 --> 00:40:40,219
Where's your apartment?

622
00:40:40,636 --> 00:40:44,223
And then Black Beauty
couldn't take it any longer,

623
00:40:44,323 --> 00:40:49,770
and he finally did
some of his own mounting.

624
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:51,814
What are you doing?

625
00:40:51,914 --> 00:40:54,024
I think I want kids of my own
one day. They're fun.

626
00:40:54,124 --> 00:40:57,486
Listen to me. I'm not going. You're
gonna have to do this one by yourself.

627
00:40:57,586 --> 00:40:59,590
- What? Why?
- Alyssa's comin' down for the weekend.

628
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:02,053
I'm gonna hang out with her.
You don't need me for this.

629
00:41:02,153 --> 00:41:05,119
Look, I'll take the bags.
You can, uh, keep the filth.

630
00:41:05,219 --> 00:41:07,121
I'll pick you up
at 9:00 Sunday night.

631
00:41:07,221 --> 00:41:10,061
Don't forget to plug the annual,
and don't mention the TV show, okay?

632
00:41:10,161 --> 00:41:12,626
Call me if you get bored.

633
00:41:12,726 --> 00:41:14,678
All aboard!

634
00:41:17,264 --> 00:41:19,529
Explain this again.

635
00:41:19,629 --> 00:41:22,182
How could you have grown up
on the shore and never played skee-ball?

636
00:41:22,282 --> 00:41:24,138
What did you do
with your youth?

637
00:41:24,238 --> 00:41:26,640
Stayed out late,
smoked pot, screwed around.

638
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,806
Not your grade school years,
your high school years.

639
00:41:28,906 --> 00:41:32,396
- This looks complicated.
- Jesus. Potzer, uh...

640
00:41:32,496 --> 00:41:35,107
- The premise is very basic, okay?
- Uh-huh.

641
00:41:35,207 --> 00:41:38,315
You roll the ball up the rampart in an
effort to pop it into the score circle.

642
00:41:38,415 --> 00:41:40,234
The higher the score,
the more prize tickets you get.

643
00:41:40,334 --> 00:41:41,989
Well, what do you do
with the prize tickets?

644
00:41:42,089 --> 00:41:44,491
You trade them in
for prizes,

645
00:41:44,591 --> 00:41:47,315
which are not worth nearly as much
as you've paid to play the game.

646
00:41:47,761 --> 00:41:51,040
- Well, what's the point?
- It's fun.

647
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:53,938
And you question
my lifestyle.

648
00:41:54,038 --> 00:41:55,638
Observe.

649
00:42:02,893 --> 00:42:04,678
See? It's just that simple.

650
00:42:04,778 --> 00:42:07,395
Well, why not just walk up there
and put it in the 50 every time...

651
00:42:07,495 --> 00:42:11,644
- Well, where's the skill in that?
- Oh, this is a skill.

652
00:42:11,744 --> 00:42:14,042
I'm sorry.
I had no idea.

653
00:42:14,142 --> 00:42:16,073
Just toss one.

654
00:42:20,982 --> 00:42:25,699
Uh, I'm sorry there, man.
She's a little new at this.

655
00:42:25,799 --> 00:42:28,223
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

656
00:42:28,323 --> 00:42:30,913
Underhand, okay?
Throw it underhand.

657
00:42:31,013 --> 00:42:33,540
And this is where you take
straight chicks on dates.

658
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,542
This place is like Spanish fly.

659
00:42:35,642 --> 00:42:38,014
This will probably be the first time
I don't score afterward.

660
00:42:38,114 --> 00:42:40,973
I don't know. I'm starting to get
a tingle in my bottom.

661
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:46,136
- Ten.
- Very nice.

662
00:42:46,236 --> 00:42:48,147
- So, what'd you do last night?
- Got laid.

663
00:42:52,568 --> 00:42:55,917
Some more of that, uh, skill
you were tellin' me about?

664
00:42:56,017 --> 00:42:59,587
I never will regret this

665
00:42:59,687 --> 00:43:02,194
I never will, never will
Never will regret this

666
00:43:02,294 --> 00:43:04,196
Never will regret this

667
00:43:04,296 --> 00:43:08,793
I never will, never will
Never will regret this

668
00:43:17,468 --> 00:43:21,818
Well, give us today
and I'm not scared to say

669
00:43:21,918 --> 00:43:23,918
I'm afraid

670
00:43:24,858 --> 00:43:27,469
Yes, I have
a couple of hesitations

671
00:43:27,569 --> 00:43:29,847
And I'll open the door

672
00:43:29,947 --> 00:43:34,268
And I wonder
if she might come in

673
00:43:34,368 --> 00:43:39,628
And do you really need
an invitation now

674
00:43:39,728 --> 00:43:43,798
'Cause I think I'm feeling
really something today

675
00:43:43,898 --> 00:43:48,115
Yes, I think I feel
a little spark, hey

676
00:43:48,215 --> 00:43:51,139
Are you sure that
control is working, Banky?

677
00:43:51,239 --> 00:43:54,643
I thought you lived
in the city.

678
00:43:54,743 --> 00:43:56,645
It's like the umpteenth time
I've seen ya here.

679
00:43:56,745 --> 00:44:00,044
Isn't that grounds for the little pink
mafia to throw you outta their club?

680
00:44:00,144 --> 00:44:01,983
Hey! That's
the last time.

681
00:44:02,083 --> 00:44:05,820
I think I feel
a little spark, hey

682
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,261
A little jump start
Never will forget this

683
00:44:09,361 --> 00:44:12,264
I never will, never will
Never will forget this

684
00:44:12,364 --> 00:44:14,663
Never will forget this

685
00:44:14,763 --> 00:44:17,478
I never will, never will
Never will forget this

686
00:44:17,578 --> 00:44:19,730
Never will forget this

687
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:22,524
I never will, never will
Never will forget this

688
00:44:22,624 --> 00:44:24,818
Never will forget this

689
00:44:24,918 --> 00:44:27,163
I never will, never will
Never will forget this

690
00:44:34,054 --> 00:44:36,559
Wow. How bad do you suck?

691
00:44:37,953 --> 00:44:40,367
How was your pseudo date?

692
00:44:40,768 --> 00:44:42,836
- Leave it alone.
- That chick bugs me.

693
00:44:42,936 --> 00:44:46,465
- No, everyone bugs you.
- Get off!

694
00:44:48,104 --> 00:44:50,094
Fuckin' faggot. Did you see that?

695
00:44:50,194 --> 00:44:53,262
Your dyke-courting ass
just got me scored on.

696
00:44:54,782 --> 00:44:57,580
You know, you should
watch that, man.

697
00:44:58,069 --> 00:45:00,437
If you're gonna get so bent
outta shape while playing the game...

698
00:45:00,537 --> 00:45:03,545
so much so that you feel
the need to curse the TV...

699
00:45:03,645 --> 00:45:05,922
try not to gay bash it,
all right?

700
00:45:06,022 --> 00:45:07,992
You're not
that kind of guy.

701
00:45:08,295 --> 00:45:12,593
And don't call her a dyke.
She's a lesbian. Okay?

702
00:45:20,391 --> 00:45:22,413
What the fuck
is goin' on here?

703
00:45:23,102 --> 00:45:25,392
- I'm starting a new page?
- Not with this shit! With you!

704
00:45:25,492 --> 00:45:27,402
What the fuck is goin' on
with you and that girl?

705
00:45:27,502 --> 00:45:30,634
- We're just friends!
- She's programming you!

706
00:45:30,734 --> 00:45:32,636
I beg your pardon?
Programming?

707
00:45:32,736 --> 00:45:35,222
Yeah, and apparently you don't
even fuckin' realize it.

708
00:45:35,322 --> 00:45:38,017
What does it matter
if I refer to her as a dyke?

709
00:45:38,117 --> 00:45:41,750
Or if I call the Whalers faggots
in the privacy of my own office...

710
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:44,690
far from the sensitive ears
of the rest of the world?

711
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:48,402
Look, man, it's
passive-aggressive gay bashing.

712
00:45:48,502 --> 00:45:50,487
And I know you're not really
prejudiced at heart.

713
00:45:50,587 --> 00:45:56,502
I think you should find some other way
to express your anger is all I'm saying.

714
00:46:09,761 --> 00:46:11,467
What are you doing?

715
00:46:11,567 --> 00:46:17,273
Just bear with me here. I want to
put you through this little exercise.

716
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:28,859
All right, now, see this?
This is a four-way road, okay?

717
00:46:28,959 --> 00:46:33,447
And dead in the center is a crisp,
new hundred-dollar bill.

718
00:46:33,547 --> 00:46:37,534
Now, at the end of each of these streets
are four people. Okay? You following?

719
00:46:37,634 --> 00:46:39,536
- Yeah.
- Good.

720
00:46:39,636 --> 00:46:42,790
Over here we have a male-affectionate,
easy-to-get-along-with,

721
00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:45,668
nonpolitical-agenda
lesbian.

722
00:46:45,768 --> 00:46:49,672
Down here we have
a man-hating, angry-as-fuck,

723
00:46:49,772 --> 00:46:53,217
agenda-of-rage,
bitter dyke.

724
00:46:53,317 --> 00:46:58,138
Over here we got Santa Claus,
and up here, the Easter Bunny.

725
00:46:58,238 --> 00:47:02,810
Which one is going to get
to the hundred-dollar bill first?

726
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:04,893
- What is this supposed to prove?
- No, I'm serious.

727
00:47:04,993 --> 00:47:07,898
This is a serious exercise.
It's like an S.A.T. question.

728
00:47:07,998 --> 00:47:11,068
Which one is going to get
to the hundred-dollar bill first?

729
00:47:11,168 --> 00:47:14,029
The male-friendly lesbian?
The man-hating dyke?

730
00:47:14,129 --> 00:47:16,255
Santa Claus
or the Easter Bunny?

731
00:47:17,822 --> 00:47:19,205
- The man-hating dyke.
- Good.

732
00:47:19,328 --> 00:47:20,828
- Why?
- I don't know.

733
00:47:20,928 --> 00:47:24,832
Because the other three are figments
of your fucking imagination!

734
00:47:24,932 --> 00:47:27,960
I don't need this. I'll be hiding
from your fuckin' shit in my room.

735
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:30,713
- What?
- What is it about this girl, man?

736
00:47:30,813 --> 00:47:33,549
You know you have no shot
at getting her into bed!

737
00:47:33,649 --> 00:47:36,051
Why do you bother
wasting time with her?

738
00:47:36,151 --> 00:47:39,075
- Because you're Holden Fucking McNeil.
- Right.

739
00:47:39,175 --> 00:47:43,726
Most persistent traveller on the road.
That's not the path of least resistance.

740
00:47:43,826 --> 00:47:46,228
Everything's gotta be
a fuckin' challenge for you.

741
00:47:46,328 --> 00:47:48,647
And this little relationship
with that bitch...

742
00:47:48,747 --> 00:47:51,595
is a prime example
of your fucking condition.

743
00:47:51,834 --> 00:47:54,225
Well, I don't need a magic eight ball
to look into your future.

744
00:47:54,325 --> 00:47:58,713
You want a forecast? Here.
Will Holden ever fuck Alyssa?

745
00:47:59,091 --> 00:48:02,036
Oh, what a shock.
Not fucking likely.

746
00:48:02,136 --> 00:48:06,123
This relationship is affecting you,
our work and our friendship.

747
00:48:06,223 --> 00:48:09,752
The time's gonna come when I throw down
the gauntlet and say, "It's me or her."

748
00:48:09,852 --> 00:48:12,115
- Then what are you gonna say?
- I say you should let this one go!

749
00:48:12,215 --> 00:48:15,716
No. What would you say? Would you
trash 20 years of fuckin' friendship...

750
00:48:15,816 --> 00:48:18,052
because you've got
some idiotic notion...

751
00:48:18,152 --> 00:48:21,555
that this chick would even let you
sniff her panties, let alone fuck her?

752
00:48:21,655 --> 00:48:24,808
Look, fuckin' asshole,
I'm telling you, okay? Let it go!

753
00:48:24,908 --> 00:48:26,831
What the fuck, man?

754
00:48:26,931 --> 00:48:28,895
What the fuck makes this bitch
all that important?

755
00:48:28,995 --> 00:48:32,158
'Cause I'm fuckin' in love
with her, man, okay?

756
00:48:38,696 --> 00:48:39,696
Fuck.

757
00:48:46,005 --> 00:48:50,376
- Well, I thought it was love
- Thought it was love

758
00:48:50,476 --> 00:48:52,636
'Cause my heart...

759
00:48:57,057 --> 00:48:59,635
Wish you were the one being
pursued for the cartoon.

760
00:48:59,735 --> 00:49:01,303
Oh, really?

761
00:49:01,403 --> 00:49:04,691
Yeah, then maybe you could sell out and
pick up a check every once in a while.

762
00:49:05,595 --> 00:49:07,497
We're leaving?

763
00:49:07,597 --> 00:49:10,282
Well, it's not like
this is a bed and breakfast.

764
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,407
I've got a little business
to conduct.

765
00:49:19,038 --> 00:49:23,242
Hello there.
Let me ask you a question.

766
00:49:23,342 --> 00:49:27,726
Are you an authorized deal maker
in this establishment?

767
00:49:27,826 --> 00:49:30,749
Do you have the power
to negotiate?

768
00:49:30,849 --> 00:49:33,752
You wanna haggle over the price
of your French dip?

769
00:49:33,852 --> 00:49:39,174
No, I wanna haggle
over the price of fine art.

770
00:49:39,274 --> 00:49:42,344
- What do you mean?
- There. By the kitchen.

771
00:49:42,713 --> 00:49:45,681
See? That painting.

772
00:49:45,781 --> 00:49:50,144
- What about it?
- The price tag says 75.

773
00:49:50,244 --> 00:49:52,327
- So?
- Tell me you're kidding.

774
00:49:53,476 --> 00:49:55,154
I'll give you 50.

775
00:50:01,956 --> 00:50:06,666
Manuel, could you bring the Dyksiezski
down off the wall, please?

776
00:50:07,378 --> 00:50:09,997
My new Dyksiezski.

777
00:50:10,097 --> 00:50:13,959
- Where are you gonna hang it?
- I'm not. You are.

778
00:50:14,059 --> 00:50:15,961
Oh? You want me
to hang it for you?

779
00:50:16,061 --> 00:50:18,124
You better hope it doesn't
get out to the girl nation...

780
00:50:18,224 --> 00:50:19,965
you needed a man
to help you hang a picture.

781
00:50:20,065 --> 00:50:23,865
No, no, no. You're going
to hang it in your house.

782
00:50:23,965 --> 00:50:27,398
- Yeah, right.
- I'm serious.

783
00:50:32,028 --> 00:50:35,648
- Why?
- Because it's captured the moment.

784
00:50:35,748 --> 00:50:38,546
It'll be a constant reminder,
not just of tonight,

785
00:50:38,646 --> 00:50:43,280
but of our introduction, of the building
of our friendship, everything.

786
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:47,847
Make no mistake about it, my friend,
it is a gift from me to you,

787
00:50:47,947 --> 00:50:51,213
so you'll always
remember us.

788
00:51:04,659 --> 00:51:06,165
Why are we stopping?

789
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:09,879
- Because I can't take this.
- Can't take what?

790
00:51:10,291 --> 00:51:11,481
I love you.

791
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,360
You love me?

792
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:25,197
I love you and not,
not in a friendly way.

793
00:51:25,297 --> 00:51:27,408
Although, I think
we're great friends.

794
00:51:27,508 --> 00:51:30,870
And not in a misplaced
affection, puppy dog way.

795
00:51:30,970 --> 00:51:33,038
Although, I'm sure
that's what you'll call it.

796
00:51:33,138 --> 00:51:36,563
I love you. Very...

797
00:51:36,663 --> 00:51:39,962
Very simple.
Very truly.

798
00:51:40,062 --> 00:51:44,842
You are the epitome of everything I have
ever looked for in another human being.

799
00:51:44,942 --> 00:51:46,907
And I know that you think of me
as just a friend,

800
00:51:47,007 --> 00:51:49,440
and crossing that line is the furthest
thing from an option...

801
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:51,390
you would ever consider,

802
00:51:51,904 --> 00:51:55,890
but...
I had to say it.

803
00:51:56,453 --> 00:51:58,418
I just...
I can't take this anymore.

804
00:51:58,518 --> 00:52:01,525
I can't stand next to you
without wanting to hold you.

805
00:52:01,625 --> 00:52:03,976
I can't... I can't look into
your eyes without feeling that...

806
00:52:04,076 --> 00:52:07,093
that longing you only read about
in trashy romance novels.

807
00:52:07,193 --> 00:52:12,870
I can't talk to you without wanting to
express my love for everything you are.

808
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:18,417
And I know this will probably queer
our friendship... no pun intended...

809
00:52:18,517 --> 00:52:22,517
but I had to say it.

810
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:26,791
'Cause I've never
felt this way before.

811
00:52:27,714 --> 00:52:31,722
And I don't care.
I like who I am because of it.

812
00:52:33,199 --> 00:52:36,879
And if bringing this to light
means we can't hang out anymore,

813
00:52:37,189 --> 00:52:38,901
then that hurts me.

814
00:52:39,893 --> 00:52:42,337
But, God, I just... I couldn't
allow another day to go by...

815
00:52:42,437 --> 00:52:45,813
without just getting it out there,
regardless of the outcome,

816
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:51,631
which, by the look on your face,
is to be the inevitable...

817
00:52:52,009 --> 00:52:53,487
shoot down.

818
00:52:54,803 --> 00:52:58,212
And, you know,
I'll accept that.

819
00:53:00,142 --> 00:53:03,927
But I know... I know that some part
of you is hesitating for a moment.

820
00:53:04,063 --> 00:53:07,413
And if there's a moment of hesitation,
then that means you feel something too.

821
00:53:07,578 --> 00:53:09,698
And all I ask, please,
is that you just...

822
00:53:09,798 --> 00:53:14,902
you just not dismiss that and try
to dwell in it for just ten seconds.

823
00:53:16,609 --> 00:53:17,609
Ah.

824
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:21,220
Alyssa.

825
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:27,446
There isn't another soul
on this fucking planet...

826
00:53:27,795 --> 00:53:31,655
who has ever made me half the person
I am when I'm with you.

827
00:53:31,902 --> 00:53:36,328
And I would risk this friendship for the
chance to take it to the next plateau,

828
00:53:36,428 --> 00:53:38,456
because it is there
between you and me.

829
00:53:38,556 --> 00:53:40,113
You can't deny that.

830
00:53:51,233 --> 00:53:53,214
Even if, you know...

831
00:53:57,483 --> 00:54:00,208
Even if we never talk again
after tonight,

832
00:54:01,537 --> 00:54:05,407
please know that
I am forever changed...

833
00:54:06,083 --> 00:54:09,966
because of who you are
and what you've meant to me,

834
00:54:10,546 --> 00:54:13,783
which, while I do
appreciate it,

835
00:54:14,717 --> 00:54:18,858
I'd never need a painting of birds
bought at a diner to remind me of.

836
00:54:35,033 --> 00:54:36,633
Oh, God.

837
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:40,108
Was it something I said?

838
00:54:41,511 --> 00:54:42,511
Fuck.

839
00:54:49,701 --> 00:54:52,279
- What are you doing?
- Get in the car and get outta here!

840
00:54:52,379 --> 00:54:54,573
- You're gonna hitch to New York?
- Yep!

841
00:54:54,673 --> 00:54:57,827
- Aren't you at least gonna comment?
- Here's my comment: Fuck you!

842
00:54:57,927 --> 00:54:59,870
- Why?
- That was so unfair.

843
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:01,309
You know how unfair that was.

844
00:55:01,409 --> 00:55:03,311
What? It's unfair
that I'm in love with you?

845
00:55:03,411 --> 00:55:05,856
No, it's unfortunate
that you're in love with me.

846
00:55:05,956 --> 00:55:09,359
It's unfair you felt the fuckin' need
to unburden your soul about it.

847
00:55:09,459 --> 00:55:12,675
Do you remember for
one fucking second who I am?

848
00:55:12,775 --> 00:55:15,094
So? I mean, you know,
people change.

849
00:55:15,194 --> 00:55:17,096
Oh! Oh!
It's that simple!

850
00:55:17,196 --> 00:55:19,974
You fall in love with me and
want a romantic relationship.

851
00:55:20,074 --> 00:55:21,976
Nothing changes for you...

852
00:55:22,076 --> 00:55:24,520
with the exception of feeling
hunky-dory all the time.

853
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:28,545
But what about me, Holden?
It's not that simple!

854
00:55:28,645 --> 00:55:31,006
I just can't get into
a relationship with you...

855
00:55:31,106 --> 00:55:34,196
without throwing my whole
fucking world into upheaval.

856
00:55:34,296 --> 00:55:38,513
That's every relationship. There's
always gonna be a period of adjustment.

857
00:55:38,613 --> 00:55:41,162
Period of adjustment?

858
00:55:41,262 --> 00:55:45,541
There's no period of adjustment,
Holden! I am fucking gay!

859
00:55:45,641 --> 00:55:47,668
That's who I am!

860
00:55:47,768 --> 00:55:53,430
You assume I can turn all that around
because you've got a fucking crush?

861
00:55:55,726 --> 00:55:59,207
If this is a crush, I don't think I could
take it if the real thing ever happened.

862
00:56:01,490 --> 00:56:03,271
Go home, Holden.

863
00:57:28,704 --> 00:57:33,015
You're back with
Chaz and Stu and the New Zoo Review.

864
00:57:33,165 --> 00:57:37,078
As always behind us we got wacky...

865
00:57:55,998 --> 00:57:58,507
I take it
that's not good.

866
00:57:58,846 --> 00:58:00,807
Stay here.

867
00:58:02,194 --> 00:58:04,994
Be right back.

868
00:58:25,397 --> 00:58:27,543
Catholic schoolgirls.

869
00:58:28,905 --> 00:58:31,112
The uniform's
what does it for me.

870
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:36,621
I wish I'd went with more
Catholic schoolgirls when I was a kid.

871
00:58:37,208 --> 00:58:41,778
As it stands, I have no "And then she
unzipped her jumper" stories.

872
00:58:43,305 --> 00:58:45,471
You seemed
weirded-out back there.

873
00:58:46,812 --> 00:58:51,207
- That's my couch you were fucking on.
- Sorry.

874
00:58:51,454 --> 00:58:55,085
I wanted to watch some TV.
Hard to do when your best friend is...

875
00:58:55,185 --> 00:58:57,664
wrapped around a naked
rug-muncher on your couch.

876
00:58:58,902 --> 00:59:00,924
She had boxers on.

877
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:09,413
- This is all gonna end badly.
- You don't know that.

878
00:59:09,513 --> 00:59:13,166
I know you. You're way
too conservative for that girl.

879
00:59:13,266 --> 00:59:16,995
She's been around and seen things
we've only read about in books.

880
00:59:17,854 --> 00:59:21,080
We have read about them,
so we're prepared.

881
00:59:21,691 --> 00:59:23,803
There's no "we" here.

882
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:28,817
You're gonna have to
go through this alone.

883
00:59:29,303 --> 00:59:31,247
It's one thing
to read about shit,

884
00:59:31,347 --> 00:59:34,655
something different when you're forced
to deal with it on a regular basis.

885
00:59:35,539 --> 00:59:39,317
When you are walking in a mall and your
heads turn at a nice-looking chick,

886
00:59:39,417 --> 00:59:41,608
it's gonna eat you up
inside.

887
00:59:42,546 --> 00:59:46,023
You'll spend most of your time wondering
when the other shoe's gonna drop.

888
00:59:47,175 --> 00:59:50,851
'Cause for you this isn't
about cool, weird sex stuff.

889
00:59:51,304 --> 00:59:52,707
It's about love.

890
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:55,616
Maybe it is
for her as well.

891
00:59:56,831 --> 00:59:58,959
Somehow I doubt it.

892
01:00:00,147 --> 01:00:02,528
Everybody's not out
to get someone in life, Bank.

893
01:00:03,045 --> 01:00:06,736
Everybody has an agenda,
all right? Everyone.

894
01:00:07,232 --> 01:00:08,470
Yourself?

895
01:00:08,676 --> 01:00:11,579
- My agenda is to watch your back.
- To what end?

896
01:00:11,679 --> 01:00:14,582
To insure that all this time we've
spent together, building something,

897
01:00:14,682 --> 01:00:15,750
wasn't wasted.

898
01:00:15,850 --> 01:00:18,558
Oh, she's not gonna
ruin the comic.

899
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:24,541
I wasn't talkin'
about the comic.

900
01:00:27,718 --> 01:00:29,806
I'm gonna go get a bagel.

901
01:00:29,906 --> 01:00:32,835
Clean off my fucking couch
so I can watch TV.

902
01:00:44,367 --> 01:00:46,712
From what I understand,
when you sign with a publisher...

903
01:00:46,812 --> 01:00:49,616
someone else does all this work for you,
and you just sit back and collect.

904
01:00:49,716 --> 01:00:52,954
And miss these late-night cram sessions
with my nearest and dearest?

905
01:00:53,054 --> 01:00:55,435
- Never.
- I don't know what she's bitching about.

906
01:00:55,535 --> 01:00:58,105
All she's done since
we got here is pound Merlot.

907
01:00:58,205 --> 01:00:59,272
Yeah, you're a real help.

908
01:00:59,372 --> 01:01:02,004
I'd like to know
why we're here at all...

909
01:01:02,104 --> 01:01:04,066
when we haven't seen
Princess Funny Book in a month.

910
01:01:04,166 --> 01:01:09,041
- Yeah. Who you shackin' up with?
- "Shacking up with"? Please.

911
01:01:11,105 --> 01:01:12,994
I'm so in love!

912
01:01:13,094 --> 01:01:14,094
Ohh!

913
01:01:15,388 --> 01:01:19,710
I know, I know. I feel like such a goon,
but I can't help it.

914
01:01:19,810 --> 01:01:22,713
- We have such a great time together.
- Who is it?

915
01:01:22,813 --> 01:01:24,715
Someone you guys don't know.

916
01:01:24,815 --> 01:01:26,819
That chick you left
the restaurant with that night.

917
01:01:26,919 --> 01:01:28,802
They're not from around here.

918
01:01:28,902 --> 01:01:30,804
Don't even tell me
you met her down the shore.

919
01:01:30,904 --> 01:01:33,536
Ew, a bridge-and-tunnel
Jersey dyke.

920
01:01:33,636 --> 01:01:36,143
With huge hair and acid-washed jeans.

921
01:01:36,243 --> 01:01:40,230
For your information, they don't have
big hair or wear acid-wash.

922
01:01:40,330 --> 01:01:42,324
They're from my hometown.

923
01:01:47,121 --> 01:01:49,239
Why are you playing
the pronoun game?

924
01:01:49,339 --> 01:01:53,056
- What are you talking about? I'm not.
- You are.

925
01:01:53,156 --> 01:01:58,498
I met "someone." "We" have a great
time. "They're" from my hometown.

926
01:01:58,598 --> 01:02:00,759
Doesn't this tube
of wonderful have a name?

927
01:02:07,975 --> 01:02:09,375
Holden.

928
01:02:24,825 --> 01:02:26,225
Well...

929
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:31,707
here's to the both of you.

930
01:02:35,377 --> 01:02:37,528
Another one bites the dust.

931
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:48,483
Can I ask you a question?

932
01:02:49,191 --> 01:02:52,052
Don't even tell me
you want to do it again.

933
01:02:55,189 --> 01:02:59,149
Why me?
You know? Why now?

934
01:02:59,701 --> 01:03:03,146
Well, because you were givin' me
that look and I got all wet.

935
01:03:03,246 --> 01:03:04,637
You know what I mean.

936
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:06,989
Why not you?

937
01:03:08,084 --> 01:03:12,786
Well, I'm a guy. I mean...
you're attracted to girls.

938
01:03:13,298 --> 01:03:15,551
I see you've been
taking notes.

939
01:03:15,905 --> 01:03:18,893
Historically, yes.
That's true.

940
01:03:20,522 --> 01:03:21,965
Then why this?

941
01:03:26,512 --> 01:03:29,497
Well, I've given that
a lot of thought, you know.

942
01:03:29,919 --> 01:03:32,864
Now that I'm being ostracized
by my friends,

943
01:03:32,964 --> 01:03:34,778
I've had plenty of time
to think about it.

944
01:03:35,913 --> 01:03:38,357
And what I've come up with
is really simple.

945
01:03:39,733 --> 01:03:42,432
I came to this
on my own terms.

946
01:03:43,161 --> 01:03:45,878
You know, I didn't just
heed what I was taught:

947
01:03:46,144 --> 01:03:49,757
Men and women should be
together, it's the natural way,

948
01:03:50,085 --> 01:03:51,448
that kind of thing.

949
01:03:52,087 --> 01:03:56,283
I'm not with you because of
what family, society, life...

950
01:03:56,978 --> 01:03:59,453
tried to instill in me
from day one.

951
01:04:01,784 --> 01:04:03,600
The way the world is,

952
01:04:04,266 --> 01:04:08,675
how seldom it is that you meet
that one person who...

953
01:04:09,354 --> 01:04:10,883
just gets you.

954
01:04:11,982 --> 01:04:13,338
It's so rare.

955
01:04:14,464 --> 01:04:16,680
My parents didn't
really have it.

956
01:04:17,633 --> 01:04:22,250
There were no examples set for me in
the world of male-female relationships.

957
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:26,686
And to cut oneself off
from finding that person...

958
01:04:27,414 --> 01:04:31,714
to immediately halve your options
by eliminating the possibility...

959
01:04:31,814 --> 01:04:35,062
of finding that one person
within your own gender...

960
01:04:35,990 --> 01:04:37,699
that just seemed stupid
to me.

961
01:04:38,549 --> 01:04:40,199
So I didn't.

962
01:04:41,519 --> 01:04:43,232
But then you came along.

963
01:04:43,993 --> 01:04:47,812
You, the one least likely.
I mean, you were a guy.

964
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:50,473
Still am.

965
01:04:50,886 --> 01:04:55,528
And while I was falling for you
I put a ceiling on that,

966
01:04:55,692 --> 01:04:57,653
because you were a guy.

967
01:04:58,570 --> 01:05:02,274
Until I remembered why I opened the door
to women in the first place:

968
01:05:03,492 --> 01:05:07,680
To not limit the likelihood
of finding that one person who'd...

969
01:05:07,850 --> 01:05:10,199
complement me so completely.

970
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:16,221
So, here we are.

971
01:05:17,693 --> 01:05:20,042
I was thorough
when I looked for you.

972
01:05:21,874 --> 01:05:24,659
And I feel justified
lying in your arms...

973
01:05:25,959 --> 01:05:28,661
'cause I got here
on my own terms,

974
01:05:29,622 --> 01:05:33,200
and I have no question there was
someplace I didn't look.

975
01:05:34,644 --> 01:05:36,872
For me that makes
all the difference.

976
01:05:53,408 --> 01:05:56,495
Can I at least tell people all you
needed was some serious deep-dicking?

977
01:06:03,377 --> 01:06:05,963
- Move!
- Stop!

978
01:06:18,980 --> 01:06:21,770
- What?
- Check out page 48.

979
01:06:34,103 --> 01:06:36,869
- So?
- Did you see the nickname?

980
01:06:39,288 --> 01:06:41,715
- "Finger Cuffs."
- And?

981
01:06:42,090 --> 01:06:46,089
- Weird nickname. What's your point?
- Do you know why it's "Finger Cuffs"?

982
01:06:46,595 --> 01:06:49,840
- No. I suppose you do.
- I do.

983
01:06:52,426 --> 01:06:56,322
Remember Cohee Lundin? Left Hudson
and went to North our senior year?

984
01:06:57,105 --> 01:06:58,105
Yeah.

985
01:06:59,107 --> 01:07:02,260
Well, asshole, I ran into him
at the stores the other day.

986
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:04,784
God, it's been ages
since I've seen him.

987
01:07:04,884 --> 01:07:08,350
- Mentioned you were dating Alyssa.
- Did you?

988
01:07:08,450 --> 01:07:10,665
Yeah. Funny thing is,
you know what he said?

989
01:07:10,765 --> 01:07:15,503
Shit, I know Alyssa Jones.
I mean, I know Alyssa Jones.

990
01:07:15,603 --> 01:07:19,653
Me and Rick Derris used to hang
around her house after school...

991
01:07:19,753 --> 01:07:22,411
and shit, 'cause her parents were,
like, never home and shit, right?

992
01:07:22,511 --> 01:07:25,243
But one day Rick whips it out and
starts rubbin' it on her leg and shit,

993
01:07:25,343 --> 01:07:27,411
chasin' her around the living room;
I was dyin'.

994
01:07:27,511 --> 01:07:30,189
You know what the crazy bitch did?
She fuckin' drops to her knees...

995
01:07:30,289 --> 01:07:33,166
and starts suckin' him off right in
front of me, like I wasn't even there.

996
01:07:33,266 --> 01:07:35,502
I almost died.
But that's not the fucked-up part.

997
01:07:35,602 --> 01:07:39,506
The fucked-up part was Rick, right
in the middle of it, pointin' at her,

998
01:07:39,606 --> 01:07:41,925
and he says "Cohee,"
just like that, "Cohee."

999
01:07:42,025 --> 01:07:43,927
So I'm like, "Yo,
I'll give it a shot."

1000
01:07:44,027 --> 01:07:46,988
I start pullin' her pants down and shit,
all slow 'cause I figure any second...

1001
01:07:47,088 --> 01:07:49,073
she's gonna turn around
and belt me in the mouth, right?

1002
01:07:49,173 --> 01:07:52,561
But she's all into it, man!
She don't try to stop me or nothin'!

1003
01:07:52,661 --> 01:07:55,482
She's all wet and I just start goin'
to work, you know what I'm sayin'?

1004
01:07:55,582 --> 01:07:58,381
Me and Rick are goin' to town on
this crazy bitch, and she's lovin' it,

1005
01:07:58,481 --> 01:08:00,381
all moaning and shit.

1006
01:08:00,481 --> 01:08:02,422
It was fucked-up. So Rick
came up with the nickname.

1007
01:08:02,522 --> 01:08:06,992
That day she had us locked in from
both sides like Chinese finger cuffs.

1008
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:08,360
He's full of shit.

1009
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:11,604
Cohee's a lot of things,
but an exaggerator he's not.

1010
01:08:11,728 --> 01:08:13,595
- The dude's Catholic.
- She's never even been with a guy.

1011
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:16,731
That's what she says.
But I say her on her hands and knees...

1012
01:08:16,831 --> 01:08:20,068
getting filled out like an application
constitutes "being with a guy."

1013
01:08:20,168 --> 01:08:23,133
Look, man. Cohee Lundin is
pulling your chain, okay?

1014
01:08:23,233 --> 01:08:26,303
The fact you even believe him makes you
look like a complete fuckin' idiot.

1015
01:08:26,403 --> 01:08:28,638
I'm getting your back,
asshole!

1016
01:08:28,738 --> 01:08:31,308
People don't forget shit
like "Finger Cuffs."

1017
01:08:31,408 --> 01:08:34,936
What if it got out that she's queer as
well? How's that gonna make you look?

1018
01:08:35,036 --> 01:08:38,357
- Well, I give a shit what people think.
- Fuck!

1019
01:08:38,457 --> 01:08:41,568
All right.
What if she's carrying a disease?

1020
01:08:41,668 --> 01:08:43,591
- Fuck you!
- What?

1021
01:08:43,691 --> 01:08:46,823
Oh, it's not possible
that she's all crudded-up?

1022
01:08:46,923 --> 01:08:50,410
Cohee I can vouch for is clean.
The dude never got laid in high school.

1023
01:08:50,510 --> 01:08:53,330
But Derris?
He's an arch-fucking-bushman!

1024
01:08:53,430 --> 01:08:57,125
Name me one chick in our senior class
that he didn't nail, for Christ's sake!

1025
01:08:57,225 --> 01:09:00,441
Let it go, okay? I'm telling you,
she's never even been with a guy,

1026
01:09:00,541 --> 01:09:02,547
much less these two
fuckin' zeroes.

1027
01:09:02,647 --> 01:09:06,259
And the bitch could be a bigger germ
farm than that monkey in Outbreak!

1028
01:09:06,359 --> 01:09:10,263
Would you let it go, okay?
I'm fuckin' tired of this shit!

1029
01:09:10,363 --> 01:09:15,310
She's my goddamn girlfriend!
Show a little fuckin' respect!

1030
01:09:15,410 --> 01:09:18,605
And I swear to God, if I ever hear you
so much as fucking mention...

1031
01:09:18,705 --> 01:09:23,173
Alyssa looks a little peaked, I'll put
your fucking teeth down your throat!

1032
01:09:27,237 --> 01:09:29,512
Maybe I'll put your fuckin'
teeth down your throat.

1033
01:09:29,795 --> 01:09:32,012
Yeah, maybe.

1034
01:09:37,243 --> 01:09:39,368
I've been workin' out,
ya know!

1035
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:43,370
You better be ready
to make that deal.

1036
01:09:46,225 --> 01:09:49,136
So, where's that bitch partner
of yours been?

1037
01:09:49,236 --> 01:09:50,429
Sulking.

1038
01:09:50,529 --> 01:09:52,513
He's having a real problem
with this Alyssa thing.

1039
01:09:52,613 --> 01:09:56,852
I think it's more like Banky's having a
real problem with all things not hetero,

1040
01:09:56,952 --> 01:09:59,813
and I'm just another paradigm
of said aberration.

1041
01:09:59,913 --> 01:10:05,110
- Banky does not hate gays.
- But he is a bit homophobic.

1042
01:10:05,210 --> 01:10:08,739
This latest episode between you
and Miss Thing has tapped into that.

1043
01:10:08,839 --> 01:10:13,326
In his warped perception, he lost you
to the "dark side," which is she.

1044
01:10:13,426 --> 01:10:15,328
You make it sound like
me and him were dating.

1045
01:10:15,428 --> 01:10:16,726
Don't kid yourself.

1046
01:10:16,826 --> 01:10:19,758
That boy loves you in a way
that he ain't ready to deal with.

1047
01:10:23,762 --> 01:10:29,009
- He's been digging up dirt on Alyssa.
- Uh-uh, honey!

1048
01:10:29,109 --> 01:10:34,973
And just what has Mr. Angela Lansbury
uncovered about your lady fair?

1049
01:10:35,073 --> 01:10:37,768
He heard some bullshit
story that she took on two guys.

1050
01:10:37,868 --> 01:10:39,268
Really?

1051
01:10:39,995 --> 01:10:43,940
Then he's barkin' up the wrong tree
if he wants to split you up, isn't he?

1052
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:46,443
He's not gonna make you see
the error of your ways...

1053
01:10:46,543 --> 01:10:48,612
by pointing out
how truly gay she's not.

1054
01:10:48,712 --> 01:10:51,531
- This one?
- I have it.

1055
01:10:51,631 --> 01:10:56,661
- Actually, it has kinda gotten to me.
- How so?

1056
01:10:56,761 --> 01:10:59,227
Well, Banky's got
a pretty good bullshit detector.

1057
01:10:59,327 --> 01:11:01,678
- He's not known for misinformation.
- So what if it is true?

1058
01:11:01,778 --> 01:11:04,252
- Would that bother you?
- Sex with multiple partners?

1059
01:11:04,352 --> 01:11:06,275
At the same time?

1060
01:11:06,375 --> 01:11:07,975
Ah! Ooh!

1061
01:11:08,377 --> 01:11:10,967
Thanks for being so comforting.
I appreciate it.

1062
01:11:11,067 --> 01:11:12,969
So, what do you care?

1063
01:11:13,069 --> 01:11:15,243
That's just it, you know?
I shouldn't care.

1064
01:11:15,343 --> 01:11:17,245
- But it just... It gets to me.
- Look,

1065
01:11:17,345 --> 01:11:20,105
the kind of gal Alyssa is, you don't
think she's been in the middle...

1066
01:11:20,205 --> 01:11:22,613
of an all-girl group grope?

1067
01:11:25,324 --> 01:11:28,819
You see, that doesn't bother me, right?
But just the thought of her with guys...

1068
01:11:28,919 --> 01:11:32,531
Oh, Holden, I beg you, please. Don't
drop 50 stories in my opinion of you...

1069
01:11:32,631 --> 01:11:35,659
by falling prey
to that latest of trendy beasts.

1070
01:11:35,759 --> 01:11:37,786
- Which is?
- Lesbian chic.

1071
01:11:37,886 --> 01:11:42,207
It's oh-so acceptable to be a gay girl
nowadays. People think it's cute.

1072
01:11:42,307 --> 01:11:45,669
Got this fool picture of lipstick
lesbians in their heads,

1073
01:11:45,769 --> 01:11:49,798
like they all resemble Alyssa,
while most of 'em look more like you.

1074
01:11:49,898 --> 01:11:52,780
Do I detect a little
intersubculture cattiness here?

1075
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:55,178
Gay or straight,
ugly's still ugly.

1076
01:11:55,278 --> 01:11:57,889
And most of those boys are scary.

1077
01:11:57,989 --> 01:12:00,132
I thought you fags were all
super-supportive of one another.

1078
01:12:00,232 --> 01:12:01,831
Screw that all-for-one shit.

1079
01:12:01,931 --> 01:12:04,547
I gotta deal with bein' a minority
in the minority of the minority,

1080
01:12:04,647 --> 01:12:06,773
and nobody's supportin'
my ass.

1081
01:12:06,873 --> 01:12:10,173
While the whole of society's
fawning over girls-on-girls,

1082
01:12:10,273 --> 01:12:12,175
here I sit, a reviled gay man.

1083
01:12:12,275 --> 01:12:14,677
And to top that off,
I'm a gay black man,

1084
01:12:14,777 --> 01:12:16,679
notoriously, the most
swishy of the bunch.

1085
01:12:16,779 --> 01:12:18,744
- Three strikes...
- Hey, hey! There's a line.

1086
01:12:18,844 --> 01:12:21,755
Are you Hooper X?

1087
01:12:25,008 --> 01:12:28,686
- Salaam alaykem, little brother.
- Could you sign my comic?

1088
01:12:33,864 --> 01:12:36,319
Hey. You see
that man right there?

1089
01:12:37,104 --> 01:12:40,074
He the devil.
Understand?

1090
01:12:40,928 --> 01:12:43,861
Never take your eye
off the Man.

1091
01:12:50,242 --> 01:12:53,443
- Fight the power, little G.
- Word is bond.

1092
01:12:53,670 --> 01:12:55,651
Word is bond.

1093
01:13:00,210 --> 01:13:02,933
Look at what I have to resort to
for professional respect.

1094
01:13:03,738 --> 01:13:05,173
Look at what I have to resort to
for professional respect.

1095
01:13:05,273 --> 01:13:06,884
What is it about gay men
that terrifies the rest of the world?

1096
01:13:08,969 --> 01:13:12,714
- As for this hang-up with Alyssa's past,
- Um-hm.

1097
01:13:12,814 --> 01:13:16,718
maybe what's troubling you is that
your fragile fantasy might not be true.

1098
01:13:16,818 --> 01:13:20,055
- What does that mean?
- Holden, don't even try to come off...

1099
01:13:20,155 --> 01:13:22,224
like you don't know
what I'm sayin'.

1100
01:13:22,324 --> 01:13:26,999
Men need to believe that they're
Marco-fuckin'-Polo when it comes to sex.

1101
01:13:27,099 --> 01:13:29,731
Like they're the only ones
who've ever explored new territory.

1102
01:13:29,831 --> 01:13:32,401
And it's hard
not to let 'em believe it.

1103
01:13:32,501 --> 01:13:34,841
I let my boys run with it for a while.

1104
01:13:34,941 --> 01:13:37,614
Feed 'em some of that "I've never
done this before" bullshit...

1105
01:13:37,714 --> 01:13:40,308
and let them labor under the delusion
that they're rockin' my world...

1106
01:13:40,408 --> 01:13:43,057
until I can't stand 'em no more,
then I hit 'em with the truth.

1107
01:13:43,157 --> 01:13:45,059
It's a sick game.

1108
01:13:45,159 --> 01:13:47,061
The world would be
a better place...

1109
01:13:47,161 --> 01:13:49,386
if people would just accept
there's nothin' new under the sun,

1110
01:13:49,486 --> 01:13:51,169
and anything you can do
with a person...

1111
01:13:51,269 --> 01:13:54,131
has probably been done
long before you got there.

1112
01:13:54,231 --> 01:13:57,634
- Hey, I can accept that.
- Honey, that almost sounded convincing.

1113
01:13:57,734 --> 01:14:02,431
Do yourself a favor: Just ask the girl
about her past point-blank.

1114
01:14:02,531 --> 01:14:05,434
Get it out of the way before it gets
too big for both of y'all to move.

1115
01:14:05,534 --> 01:14:07,444
Ooh! Yanni!

1116
01:14:20,290 --> 01:14:22,090
Boo! Boo!

1117
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:29,333
Since most of these people
are rooting for the home team,

1118
01:14:29,433 --> 01:14:31,335
I'm going to cheer
for the visitors.

1119
01:14:31,435 --> 01:14:33,670
I'm a big visitors fan.

1120
01:14:33,770 --> 01:14:37,307
Especially the kind that make coffee
for you in the morning before they go.

1121
01:14:39,351 --> 01:14:42,471
That was a joke.
Bah-dum-bah.

1122
01:14:42,571 --> 01:14:45,599
A little wacky wordplay.

1123
01:14:45,699 --> 01:14:48,435
Wha-What do you mean,
"visitors"?

1124
01:14:48,535 --> 01:14:50,479
Was I being
too obscure?

1125
01:14:50,579 --> 01:14:55,742
The kind that, until recently,
had no dicks and would stay the night.

1126
01:14:57,035 --> 01:15:00,179
So, uh, that was
until recently, right?

1127
01:15:01,047 --> 01:15:02,572
Uh, yeah.

1128
01:15:09,047 --> 01:15:13,126
Hey! Foul! Foul!
He was traveling or something.

1129
01:15:13,630 --> 01:15:17,075
So, nobody but me has spent the night
at your place since we got together?

1130
01:15:17,942 --> 01:15:19,487
Somethin' on your mind,
Holden?

1131
01:15:20,459 --> 01:15:23,970
- Just wondering.
- If I've been faithful or something?

1132
01:15:24,667 --> 01:15:27,102
I was just asking.

1133
01:15:27,574 --> 01:15:29,974
Oh, sweetie.

1134
01:15:30,932 --> 01:15:33,271
I only have eyes for you.

1135
01:15:38,911 --> 01:15:43,318
If you don't start usin' that whistle,
I'm gonna jam it straight up your ass!

1136
01:15:44,597 --> 01:15:45,690
Right?

1137
01:15:47,169 --> 01:15:50,172
What's uh...
What's with "Finger Cuffs"?

1138
01:16:04,382 --> 01:16:05,700
"Finger Cuffs"?

1139
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:10,642
In your senior yearbook your nickname
was Finger Cuffs. What does that mean?

1140
01:16:10,742 --> 01:16:13,047
- It was?
- Yeah.

1141
01:16:14,780 --> 01:16:17,190
Shit.
Damned if I can remember.

1142
01:16:17,290 --> 01:16:20,444
I'd look it up, but I threw
all that shit out years ago.

1143
01:16:20,544 --> 01:16:23,651
- Where'd you see a North yearbook?
- Do you know a Rick Derris?

1144
01:16:25,582 --> 01:16:28,252
- Rick Derris?
- Yeah.

1145
01:16:30,754 --> 01:16:33,224
Sure. We used to
hang out in high school.

1146
01:16:33,849 --> 01:16:36,209
Punch him in the fuckin' neck,
number 12!

1147
01:16:36,309 --> 01:16:39,504
Come on. Come on!

1148
01:16:39,604 --> 01:16:42,007
Did you guys, like,
date or something?

1149
01:16:42,405 --> 01:16:46,345
Date Rick Derris?
No, no. We just hung out a lot.

1150
01:16:46,510 --> 01:16:48,847
Just-Just you and Rick.

1151
01:16:49,192 --> 01:16:52,823
No. Me, Rick and, um...

1152
01:16:53,034 --> 01:16:55,093
God, what was his name?

1153
01:16:55,328 --> 01:16:57,960
Um... What was his name?

1154
01:16:58,146 --> 01:17:00,147
- What was his name?
- Cohee.

1155
01:17:00,354 --> 01:17:02,444
Yes! Cohee! Cohee Lundin!

1156
01:17:02,544 --> 01:17:04,788
God, I haven't thought
about that name in years.

1157
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:11,495
Those guys used to come over to my house
almost every day after school.

1158
01:17:11,595 --> 01:17:15,707
They'd bug my sisters, look through
my dad's closet for porno tapes,

1159
01:17:15,807 --> 01:17:17,876
raid the fridge.

1160
01:17:17,976 --> 01:17:21,054
They really took advantage
of my parents' never being home.

1161
01:17:24,516 --> 01:17:26,447
This one day,

1162
01:17:26,547 --> 01:17:30,472
Rick pulled his dick out and started
chasing me around the house with it.

1163
01:17:30,572 --> 01:17:32,733
Right in front of Cohee, man.
I couldn't believe it.

1164
01:17:36,195 --> 01:17:39,127
Rick pulled his dick out?
Really?

1165
01:17:39,227 --> 01:17:41,775
What did you do?

1166
01:17:41,875 --> 01:17:44,495
I blew him
while Cohee fucked me!

1167
01:17:49,682 --> 01:17:52,661
- Excuse me?
- That's what you wanted to hear.

1168
01:17:52,761 --> 01:17:57,295
That's what this little
cross-examination of your is all about?

1169
01:17:57,891 --> 01:18:00,314
Well, next time try not to
make it so obvious, all right?

1170
01:18:00,414 --> 01:18:04,330
There's subtler ways
of badgering a witness. Am I right?

1171
01:18:04,898 --> 01:18:07,714
Geez, man. Even I knew
what you were gettin' at.

1172
01:18:08,235 --> 01:18:11,638
If you wanted background information
on me, all you had to do was ask.

1173
01:18:11,738 --> 01:18:13,661
I would have gladly
volunteered it.

1174
01:18:13,761 --> 01:18:16,544
You didn't have to go playing
Hercule-fucking-Poirot.

1175
01:18:22,630 --> 01:18:24,487
Told ya these were
good seats.

1176
01:18:34,128 --> 01:18:35,928
Hey. Hey!

1177
01:18:39,091 --> 01:18:41,356
- Hey, would you wait a minute?
- Get the fuck off me!

1178
01:18:41,456 --> 01:18:45,526
- So it's true, right?
- Is that what you wanna hear?

1179
01:18:45,626 --> 01:18:47,528
Yeah, Holden, it's true.

1180
01:18:47,628 --> 01:18:51,553
In fact, everything you heard
or dug up on me is probably true.

1181
01:18:51,653 --> 01:18:54,035
Yeah, I took on
two guys at once!

1182
01:18:54,752 --> 01:18:57,559
You wanna hear some gems
you might not have unearthed?

1183
01:18:57,659 --> 01:19:00,708
I took a 26-year-old guy
to my senior prom...

1184
01:19:00,808 --> 01:19:05,356
and left to have sex with him
and Gwen Turner in the back of a limo.

1185
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:10,322
How about in college when I let Shannon
Hamilton videotape us having sex,

1186
01:19:10,422 --> 01:19:15,035
only to find out he broadcast it
on the campus cable station.

1187
01:19:15,362 --> 01:19:20,061
They're all true. Didn't you know?
I am the queen of suburban legend!

1188
01:19:20,161 --> 01:19:22,376
Did you somehow fuckin' fail
to mention this to me?

1189
01:19:22,476 --> 01:19:24,906
What the fuck's wrong with you?
How could you do all those things?

1190
01:19:25,006 --> 01:19:26,296
Easily!

1191
01:19:26,396 --> 01:19:31,239
Some I did out of stupidity, some
I did out of what I thought was love.

1192
01:19:31,339 --> 01:19:34,346
But good or bad,
they are my choices,

1193
01:19:34,446 --> 01:19:37,474
and I am not making
apologies for them now!

1194
01:19:37,574 --> 01:19:40,915
Not to you,
or not to anyone!

1195
01:19:41,015 --> 01:19:45,566
And how dare you lay a guilt trip on me
about it, in public, no less?

1196
01:19:45,834 --> 01:19:49,486
Who the fuck do you think
you are, you judgmental prick?

1197
01:19:49,586 --> 01:19:51,822
How the fuck am I supposed
to feel about all this?

1198
01:19:51,922 --> 01:19:54,074
How are you supposed to
feel about it?

1199
01:19:54,174 --> 01:19:57,974
Feel whatever the fuck you want
to about it, all right?

1200
01:19:58,074 --> 01:20:02,382
The only thing that matters
is how you feel about me.

1201
01:20:04,301 --> 01:20:06,503
- I don't know how I feel about you now.
- Why? Why?

1202
01:20:06,603 --> 01:20:09,277
- Because I had some sex?
- Some sex?

1203
01:20:09,377 --> 01:20:13,885
Yes, Holden.
That's all it was, some sex.

1204
01:20:13,985 --> 01:20:16,284
Most of it
stupid high school sex.

1205
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:18,828
Like you never had sex
in high school.

1206
01:20:18,928 --> 01:20:23,186
There is a world of fucking difference
between typical high school sex...

1207
01:20:23,286 --> 01:20:27,128
and getting fucked by two fuckin' guys
at the same time!

1208
01:20:27,228 --> 01:20:31,507
- They fuckin' used you.
- No! I used them!

1209
01:20:31,607 --> 01:20:35,907
You don't think I would have let it
happen if I hadn't wanted to, do you?

1210
01:20:36,007 --> 01:20:39,867
I was an experimental girl,
for Christ's sake!

1211
01:20:40,078 --> 01:20:44,358
Maybe you knew early on
that your track was from point A to B,

1212
01:20:44,458 --> 01:20:48,258
but, unlike you, I was not given
a fucking map at birth.

1213
01:20:48,358 --> 01:20:50,530
So I tried it all.

1214
01:20:50,630 --> 01:20:55,786
That is until we...
that's you and I... got together.

1215
01:20:55,886 --> 01:20:58,872
And suddenly I was sated.

1216
01:20:58,972 --> 01:21:02,316
Can't you take
some fucking comfort in that?

1217
01:21:02,601 --> 01:21:06,588
You turned out to be
all I was looking for,

1218
01:21:06,688 --> 01:21:11,018
the missing piece
in the big fucking puzzle.

1219
01:21:15,647 --> 01:21:20,227
Look, I'm sorry I let you believe you
were the only guy I'd ever been with.

1220
01:21:20,327 --> 01:21:23,355
I should have been
more honest.

1221
01:21:23,455 --> 01:21:27,630
But it just didn't... It seemed
to make you feel special in a way...

1222
01:21:27,730 --> 01:21:33,624
that me telling you over and over how
incredible you are wouldn't get across.

1223
01:21:34,708 --> 01:21:37,117
Holden, I'm sorry.

1224
01:21:37,803 --> 01:21:39,552
Just don't do that.

1225
01:21:43,245 --> 01:21:48,088
Do you mean to tell me that,
while you have zero problem...

1226
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:51,245
with me sleeping with
half the women in New York City,

1227
01:21:51,345 --> 01:21:54,748
you have some sort of half-assed,
mealy-mouthed objection...

1228
01:21:54,848 --> 01:21:58,544
to pubescent antics that took place
almost ten years ago?

1229
01:21:58,644 --> 01:22:01,889
What the fuck
is your problem?

1230
01:22:03,390 --> 01:22:05,947
I want us to be something
that we can't be.

1231
01:22:06,047 --> 01:22:07,949
And what's that?

1232
01:22:08,049 --> 01:22:10,481
A normal couple.

1233
01:22:12,358 --> 01:22:16,270
So why don't you give
your little voice a rest

1234
01:22:16,370 --> 01:22:19,461
- Fuck!
- Come on up inside my bed

1235
01:22:19,561 --> 01:22:23,244
And just pretend you need me

1236
01:22:24,995 --> 01:22:29,542
You don't have to lie
about what you know

1237
01:22:29,667 --> 01:22:35,256
Even though
I've been sufferin'

1238
01:22:36,966 --> 01:22:40,919
And I don't need to be
your only one

1239
01:22:41,019 --> 01:22:44,006
I don't need your comforting

1240
01:22:44,106 --> 01:22:48,269
I just need you with me

1241
01:22:49,770 --> 01:22:54,224
Stay, stay, stay with me

1242
01:22:54,324 --> 01:22:57,924
Stay, stay with me

1243
01:23:00,364 --> 01:23:02,253
Stay and don't you ever
roll away from me

1244
01:23:02,353 --> 01:23:03,784
The girl?

1245
01:23:06,203 --> 01:23:07,203
Stay

1246
01:23:08,213 --> 01:23:10,613
Stay with me

1247
01:23:12,593 --> 01:23:14,545
Oh, and did she ever

1248
01:23:21,343 --> 01:23:24,805
Well, look at this
morose motherfucker right here.

1249
01:23:27,933 --> 01:23:31,408
Smells like someone shit
in his cereal. Nooch.

1250
01:23:31,508 --> 01:23:33,879
What took you guys so long?
What are you, at the mall again?

1251
01:23:33,981 --> 01:23:38,415
Bitch, don't even start, all right?
We stopped that shit years ago.

1252
01:23:38,515 --> 01:23:40,446
Toss the salad.

1253
01:23:46,368 --> 01:23:49,455
Damn, this likeness rights shit
is more profitable than sellin' smoke.

1254
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:53,582
How did a dirt merchant like you
ever learn about likeness rights?

1255
01:23:53,682 --> 01:23:57,079
We deal to a lot of lawyers.
You know what I'm sayin'?

1256
01:23:57,179 --> 01:24:00,791
Speaking of which...
A little signin' bonus and shit?

1257
01:24:00,891 --> 01:24:06,672
No, I'll pass.
Did you guys take a look at the issue?

1258
01:24:06,772 --> 01:24:07,772
Yeah.

1259
01:24:09,399 --> 01:24:13,616
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1260
01:24:13,716 --> 01:24:15,806
You need to throw some pussy
in that book, man.

1261
01:24:15,906 --> 01:24:18,726
Like, throw some supervillain
with big fuckin' tits...

1262
01:24:18,826 --> 01:24:21,666
that shoot milk or somethin',
and I'll just, like, suck her dry...

1263
01:24:21,766 --> 01:24:23,918
and bust some moves
on her.

1264
01:24:28,327 --> 01:24:31,676
Then she has to fuck me.
I mean, fuck us.

1265
01:24:31,882 --> 01:24:34,333
I'll see what I can do.

1266
01:24:35,967 --> 01:24:39,350
- All right, boys. What'll it be?
- I'm all set, thanks.

1267
01:24:40,305 --> 01:24:44,460
Yo, Flo. Tell Mel to whip me up
a toasted bagel with cream cheese.

1268
01:24:44,652 --> 01:24:49,598
You want one too? Make that two,
and kiss my grits. Nooch.

1269
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:55,141
Did you ever watch that show, Alice?
That show was funny as hell, man.

1270
01:24:56,515 --> 01:24:59,708
So why the long face, horse?
Banky on the rag?

1271
01:25:00,002 --> 01:25:03,024
I'm just, uh... I'm just havin'
a little girl trouble.

1272
01:25:03,124 --> 01:25:06,026
Bitch pressin' charges?
I get that a lot.

1273
01:25:06,232 --> 01:25:09,351
No. I'm just, uh...

1274
01:25:10,811 --> 01:25:13,027
I'm just at a point where
I don't really know what to do.

1275
01:25:13,350 --> 01:25:16,808
Kick her to the fuckin' curb.
Girls get to be too much trouble.

1276
01:25:16,908 --> 01:25:20,029
There's always the band... of the hand.

1277
01:25:21,572 --> 01:25:24,399
Can't do it, G.
I'm in love.

1278
01:25:24,738 --> 01:25:28,529
Nah, there ain't no such thing. You
got to boil it down to the essentials.

1279
01:25:28,629 --> 01:25:33,417
It's like Cube says: Life ain't
nothin' but bitches and money

1280
01:25:35,085 --> 01:25:38,518
Thanks, guys. That's just what I needed.
Advice from the 'hood.

1281
01:25:38,829 --> 01:25:43,260
- So who is this girl?
- Oh, I don't think you know her.

1282
01:25:44,511 --> 01:25:47,339
Come on, man.
I'm people who know people.

1283
01:25:47,515 --> 01:25:49,341
You sound
like Barbra Streisand.

1284
01:25:49,805 --> 01:25:52,181
Maybe 'cause I got this tubby bitch
playin' her greatest hits tape...

1285
01:25:52,281 --> 01:25:54,179
in my ear all the time.

1286
01:25:54,279 --> 01:25:58,475
You gotta see it. When she starts
singin' "You Don't Bring Me Flowers,"

1287
01:25:58,575 --> 01:26:01,687
this faggot starts cryin' like a little
girl with a skinned knee and shit.

1288
01:26:01,787 --> 01:26:05,607
Big fuckin' softie.
So what's the skirt's name?

1289
01:26:05,835 --> 01:26:08,089
I'm tellin' ya, man.
You don't know the girl.

1290
01:26:08,393 --> 01:26:12,456
I ain't playin', man.
Come on, tell me her name, Mysterio.

1291
01:26:14,376 --> 01:26:16,126
Alyssa Jones.

1292
01:26:18,379 --> 01:26:21,269
Holy fuckin' shit.
Finger Cuffs?

1293
01:26:21,948 --> 01:26:25,310
You're dating Finger Cuffs,
you silly son of a bitch?

1294
01:26:26,103 --> 01:26:28,158
Wait a second.
I thought she was all gay and shit.

1295
01:26:28,376 --> 01:26:31,237
She was, or she is.
I don't know.

1296
01:26:31,337 --> 01:26:34,407
And you're dating her.
Man, you're a lucky fuck.

1297
01:26:34,507 --> 01:26:36,409
She ever bring bitches to bed
with you?

1298
01:26:36,509 --> 01:26:38,682
Get a little of that
Filet-O-Fish sandwich goin' on?

1299
01:26:38,782 --> 01:26:41,268
Yeah, you know what
I'm talkin' about, baby. Right?

1300
01:26:41,368 --> 01:26:45,230
What's up? Yeah.
So four tits and what?

1301
01:26:45,330 --> 01:26:48,984
- No, man. It's not like that.
- What's it like, then?

1302
01:26:49,084 --> 01:26:52,946
Right now?
I don't know.

1303
01:26:53,046 --> 01:26:55,991
I love her, you know?
But, uh, she has a past.

1304
01:26:56,091 --> 01:27:00,424
I'll say. Stuffin' two guys,
eatin' chicks out and shit.

1305
01:27:00,569 --> 01:27:02,331
You know, I heard
one time she had this dog...

1306
01:27:02,446 --> 01:27:04,881
Eat your fuckin' bagel already
and shut up.

1307
01:27:06,056 --> 01:27:09,172
Look at this touchy
motherfucker right here.

1308
01:27:10,327 --> 01:27:12,390
So if you're all in love and shit,
what's the problem?

1309
01:27:12,741 --> 01:27:15,217
The problem is
stupid shit like that.

1310
01:27:15,986 --> 01:27:17,907
It was bad enough when it was
just girls, you know?

1311
01:27:18,007 --> 01:27:21,117
You throw guys into the mix...
two guys at once, no less...

1312
01:27:21,674 --> 01:27:24,978
All that experience, you know?
What am I supposed to think?

1313
01:27:25,182 --> 01:27:29,983
Think "good," ya fuckin' ninny shithead,
'cause now she'll be all true and blue.

1314
01:27:30,083 --> 01:27:34,863
Bitch tasted life. Now she's settlin'
for your borin' funny-book-makin' ass.

1315
01:27:34,963 --> 01:27:38,158
Settling for my boring ass.
That's comforting. Thanks, Jay.

1316
01:27:38,258 --> 01:27:42,821
- That's what I'm here for.
- I'm just havin' a problem with it.

1317
01:27:43,305 --> 01:27:47,050
It's like I can't get these visuals out
of my head of her doing all this shit.

1318
01:27:47,601 --> 01:27:51,692
And I don't know why I can't let
it go, 'cause I'm crazy about this girl.

1319
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:56,051
- I look at her, I see kids, grandkids...
- You're scarin' me.

1320
01:27:56,151 --> 01:27:58,829
Yeah, well, I'm scarin' myself
'cause I think so much of this girl...

1321
01:27:58,929 --> 01:28:02,028
that I can't get stupid shit
like "Finger Cuffs" out of my head.

1322
01:28:03,525 --> 01:28:06,299
I don't know.
I don't know what I'm doin'.

1323
01:28:10,783 --> 01:28:12,447
Chasin' Amy.

1324
01:28:14,578 --> 01:28:17,295
What?
What did you say?

1325
01:28:19,959 --> 01:28:23,078
- You're chasing Amy.
- What do you look so shocked for, man?

1326
01:28:23,178 --> 01:28:27,124
Fat bastard does this all the time. He
thinks 'cause he don't say anything...

1327
01:28:27,224 --> 01:28:29,877
it'll have some huge impact
when he does open his fuckin' mouth.

1328
01:28:29,977 --> 01:28:31,448
Jesus Christ,
why don't you shut up?

1329
01:28:31,675 --> 01:28:35,265
Always yap-yap-yapping all the time.
Give me a fuckin' headache.

1330
01:28:36,483 --> 01:28:39,364
I went through somethin' like what
you're talkin' about a couple years ago.

1331
01:28:39,464 --> 01:28:41,647
- This chick named Amy.
- When?

1332
01:28:43,065 --> 01:28:44,796
A couple of years ago.

1333
01:28:45,367 --> 01:28:47,756
What, she live in Canada or something?
Why don't I remember this?

1334
01:28:47,856 --> 01:28:49,584
Bitch, what you don't
know about me...

1335
01:28:49,684 --> 01:28:51,666
I could just about squeeze
in the Grand-fucking-Canyon.

1336
01:28:51,806 --> 01:28:56,069
Did you know I always wanted to be
a dancer in Vegas? Huh?

1337
01:28:56,169 --> 01:28:58,495
Bet you didn't even know
that shit, did you?

1338
01:28:59,965 --> 01:29:02,757
Just tell your fuckin' story so
we can get out of here and smoke this.

1339
01:29:04,545 --> 01:29:09,079
So there's me and Amy. And we're
inseparable. Just big-time in love.

1340
01:29:09,516 --> 01:29:12,419
Then four months down the road
the idiot gear kicks in,

1341
01:29:12,519 --> 01:29:15,944
and I ask about the ex-boyfriend which,
as we all know, is a really dumb move.

1342
01:29:16,044 --> 01:29:19,426
But you know how it is: You don't want
to know, but you just have to know.

1343
01:29:19,526 --> 01:29:20,797
Stupid guy bullshit.

1344
01:29:21,528 --> 01:29:23,273
So, anyway, she starts
tellin' me about him.

1345
01:29:24,072 --> 01:29:28,352
They fell in love, went out for
a couple of years, lived together.

1346
01:29:28,452 --> 01:29:31,979
Her mother likes me better,
blah, blah, blah, blah. And I'm okay.

1347
01:29:32,268 --> 01:29:35,321
But then she drops the bomb on me,
and the bomb is this:

1348
01:29:35,542 --> 01:29:38,333
It seems that a couple of times,
while they were goin' out,

1349
01:29:38,900 --> 01:29:41,156
he brought some people
to bed with them.

1350
01:29:41,256 --> 01:29:42,913
Menage-a-trois,
I believe it's called.

1351
01:29:43,346 --> 01:29:47,162
Now this just blows my mind, right?
I'm not used to this sort of thing.

1352
01:29:47,262 --> 01:29:51,062
- I was raised Catholic, for God's sakes.
- Saint Shithead.

1353
01:29:51,725 --> 01:29:53,002
Do somethin'.

1354
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:56,837
So I'm totally weirded out by this,
right? And I just start blastin' her.

1355
01:29:56,937 --> 01:29:59,857
I don't know how to deal with what I'm
feelin', so I figure the best way is...

1356
01:29:59,957 --> 01:30:02,718
if call her "slut," right,
and tell her she was used.

1357
01:30:02,818 --> 01:30:05,867
I'm out for blood.
I really want to hurt this girl.

1358
01:30:05,967 --> 01:30:09,808
"What the fuck is your problem?"
And she's just calmly trying to tell me,

1359
01:30:09,908 --> 01:30:13,812
"It was that time, that place," and she
doesn't think she should apologize...

1360
01:30:13,912 --> 01:30:16,059
because she doesn't feel
that she's done anything wrong.

1361
01:30:16,159 --> 01:30:20,869
I'm like, "Oh, really?" I look her in
the eye and tell her it's over. I walk.

1362
01:30:22,900 --> 01:30:24,750
Fuckin' A.

1363
01:30:24,927 --> 01:30:27,621
No, idiot.
It was a mistake.

1364
01:30:27,721 --> 01:30:30,142
I wasn't disgusted with her,
I was afraid.

1365
01:30:30,513 --> 01:30:33,606
You know, at that moment I felt small,
like I'd lacked experience,

1366
01:30:33,706 --> 01:30:38,215
like I'd never be on her level, never be
enough for her or something like that.

1367
01:30:38,315 --> 01:30:41,718
But what I did not get,
she didn't care.

1368
01:30:41,818 --> 01:30:45,904
She wasn't lookin' for that guy anymore,
she was lookin' for me, for the Bob.

1369
01:30:46,544 --> 01:30:51,624
But by the time I figured this all
out, it's too late, man. She moved on.

1370
01:30:51,949 --> 01:30:55,532
All I had to show for it was foolish
pride which then gave way to regret.

1371
01:30:57,159 --> 01:31:00,775
She was the girl.
I know that now.

1372
01:31:01,567 --> 01:31:02,767
But...

1373
01:31:05,918 --> 01:31:07,521
I pushed her away.

1374
01:31:14,468 --> 01:31:17,094
So I've spent every day
since then chasing Amy.

1375
01:31:20,849 --> 01:31:22,127
So to speak.

1376
01:31:22,901 --> 01:31:27,639
Enough of this fuckin' melodrama.
My advice? Forget her, dude.

1377
01:31:27,739 --> 01:31:31,370
There's one bitch in the world,
one bitch with many faces.

1378
01:31:32,202 --> 01:31:36,383
Get up, tons of fun.
We gotta book.

1379
01:31:36,790 --> 01:31:40,489
- Catchin' a bus to Chi-town.
- Why? What's there?

1380
01:31:40,607 --> 01:31:44,323
Business, yo. How many more of those
fat envelopes we get comin' to us?

1381
01:31:44,423 --> 01:31:46,761
Uh, I don't know.

1382
01:31:47,322 --> 01:31:49,443
I don't know how much longer
the book's gonna be around.

1383
01:31:50,165 --> 01:31:53,920
Yeah, good.
I'll be glad as shit when it's gone.

1384
01:31:54,085 --> 01:31:57,169
There's a million people who'd love
to see themself in a comic book.

1385
01:31:57,269 --> 01:31:59,963
But that ain't like us at all,
all slapsticky and shit,

1386
01:32:00,063 --> 01:32:01,700
runnin' around like
a couple of dickheads.

1387
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:04,676
Sayin'... What's that shit
he got us sayin'?

1388
01:32:04,776 --> 01:32:08,076
Oh, um...
"snootchie-bootchies."

1389
01:32:08,176 --> 01:32:13,569
"Snootchie-bootchies." Who the fuck
talks like that? That is baby talk.

1390
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:18,482
It's a big world, G.
We're bound to run into you again.

1391
01:32:18,582 --> 01:32:22,423
- Till then, keep your unit on ya.
- I'll try.

1392
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:25,948
No, no, no, no, no.
Do or do not. There is no try...

1393
01:32:26,048 --> 01:32:30,327
Knock that shit off!
We got a bus to catch.

1394
01:32:30,427 --> 01:32:34,373
Jedi bitch. Man, what do you always have
to tell that fuckin' gay story for?

1395
01:32:34,473 --> 01:32:36,342
- Man, shut up.
- You shut up, you fat fuck.

1396
01:33:25,641 --> 01:33:26,641
Okay.

1397
01:33:27,274 --> 01:33:31,937
You guys are probably wondering
why I asked you here at the same time...

1398
01:33:32,322 --> 01:33:36,018
knowing that we have shit
to settle between us separately.

1399
01:33:36,118 --> 01:33:39,354
I just figured you wanted
to kill two birds with one stone.

1400
01:33:39,901 --> 01:33:42,274
You know, by telling her
to fuck off with me here...

1401
01:33:42,374 --> 01:33:44,797
so you wouldn't have to
go through the story again later on.

1402
01:33:44,897 --> 01:33:48,280
- Fuck you.
- Not even if you let me videotape it.

1403
01:33:48,380 --> 01:33:50,670
Okay, enough.
All right?

1404
01:33:52,751 --> 01:33:53,888
Enough.

1405
01:33:55,888 --> 01:33:59,813
Now, I've been going over and
over and over this whole thing,

1406
01:33:59,913 --> 01:34:02,058
and I've dissected it
a thousand different ways.

1407
01:34:03,069 --> 01:34:06,298
Banky, there's tension between you and I
for the first time in our lives.

1408
01:34:06,398 --> 01:34:11,136
You hate me dating Alyssa and you want
me to sign off on this cartoon thing.

1409
01:34:11,796 --> 01:34:13,368
How perceptive.

1410
01:34:13,468 --> 01:34:14,868
Alyssa,

1411
01:34:17,944 --> 01:34:19,615
you and I have hit a wall...

1412
01:34:19,912 --> 01:34:24,337
'cause I don't know how to deal
with your, uh, your past, I guess.

1413
01:34:24,731 --> 01:34:26,339
That's a nice way
of putting it.

1414
01:34:26,439 --> 01:34:28,412
I'd have said
"the whole double stuff" thing.

1415
01:34:35,002 --> 01:34:38,163
I'm only gonna
tell you this once: Shut up.

1416
01:34:40,782 --> 01:34:41,782
Now,

1417
01:34:42,413 --> 01:34:46,373
I know I'm to blame one way
or another on both accounts.

1418
01:34:47,147 --> 01:34:51,093
Alyssa, with you
because... I feel inadequate,

1419
01:34:51,820 --> 01:34:54,894
because you've had such a big life
and so much experience,

1420
01:34:55,245 --> 01:34:57,224
and my life's been
pretty small in comparison.

1421
01:34:57,514 --> 01:35:00,444
- That doesn't matter to me.
- Please.

1422
01:35:00,577 --> 01:35:02,858
I have to get
through this, okay?

1423
01:35:04,591 --> 01:35:09,418
Banky, I know why you're having such
a hard time with me and Alyssa.

1424
01:35:09,686 --> 01:35:12,018
It's something that's been
obvious forever and I guess...

1425
01:35:12,698 --> 01:35:14,959
I guess I just didn't
acknowledge it.

1426
01:35:17,237 --> 01:35:18,462
You're in love with me.

1427
01:35:21,590 --> 01:35:22,590
What?

1428
01:35:23,076 --> 01:35:26,728
You're attracted to me. Just as, in
a way, I guess I'm... attracted to you.

1429
01:35:26,913 --> 01:35:30,343
It makes sense. We've been together
so long, we have so much in common.

1430
01:35:30,443 --> 01:35:32,422
Well, I gotta get goin'.

1431
01:35:32,649 --> 01:35:35,938
I gotta catch the last few minutes
of Little House.

1432
01:35:45,110 --> 01:35:47,157
It's somethin' you're
gonna have to deal with, Bank.

1433
01:35:48,659 --> 01:35:50,861
And that would explain
your jealousy of Alyssa,

1434
01:35:50,961 --> 01:35:53,614
your homophobia,
your sense of humor...

1435
01:35:53,714 --> 01:35:56,450
Jesus, just 'cause a guy's
got a predilection toward dick jokes...

1436
01:35:56,550 --> 01:35:58,561
Bank. Stop.

1437
01:35:59,303 --> 01:36:02,339
Deal with it.
You'll feel much better.

1438
01:36:05,514 --> 01:36:06,514
Okay.

1439
01:36:11,974 --> 01:36:15,865
Now, you guys are probably
asking yourselves the same question...

1440
01:36:15,965 --> 01:36:19,440
that I've been going over and over
in my head the past few weeks:

1441
01:36:19,990 --> 01:36:21,892
What does one have
to do with the other?

1442
01:36:21,992 --> 01:36:23,185
Don't.

1443
01:36:23,793 --> 01:36:26,536
And when I did some
serious soul-searching,

1444
01:36:26,935 --> 01:36:29,074
it came to me
from outta nowhere.

1445
01:36:29,270 --> 01:36:32,911
And it all made sense.
And a calm came over me.

1446
01:36:34,442 --> 01:36:36,708
I know what we have to do.

1447
01:36:37,591 --> 01:36:41,824
And then you, Banky,
you, Alyssa, and I...

1448
01:36:41,929 --> 01:36:46,611
all of us...
can finally be... all right.

1449
01:36:47,085 --> 01:36:49,024
Please don't say it.

1450
01:36:52,098 --> 01:36:54,285
We've all gotta
have sex together.

1451
01:37:04,374 --> 01:37:05,915
I mean, look,
don't you see?

1452
01:37:07,324 --> 01:37:09,387
That would take care
of everything.

1453
01:37:09,811 --> 01:37:12,818
Alyssa, with you, I won't feel
too inadequate or conservative anymore,

1454
01:37:12,918 --> 01:37:16,009
because I'll have done something
on a par with all your experience.

1455
01:37:16,171 --> 01:37:20,033
And it will be with you, which will
make it that much more powerful.

1456
01:37:20,968 --> 01:37:22,870
Banky, you can take that leap...

1457
01:37:22,970 --> 01:37:25,211
that everyone else but you
sees you should take.

1458
01:37:25,368 --> 01:37:28,285
And it'll be with me,
your best friend for years.

1459
01:37:28,809 --> 01:37:30,752
We've been everything to each other
but intimates,

1460
01:37:30,852 --> 01:37:32,989
and now we'll have been
through that together too.

1461
01:37:33,501 --> 01:37:36,240
And it won't be a total leap for you
because a woman will be involved.

1462
01:37:36,340 --> 01:37:40,408
And when it's over, all that hostility
you feel toward Alyssa will be gone...

1463
01:37:40,508 --> 01:37:43,308
because you'll have shared in something
beautiful with the woman I love.

1464
01:37:44,789 --> 01:37:46,481
It'll be cathartic.

1465
01:37:47,142 --> 01:37:49,071
This will keep us together.

1466
01:37:58,706 --> 01:37:59,829
What do ya say?

1467
01:38:15,639 --> 01:38:16,639
Sure.

1468
01:38:33,788 --> 01:38:35,769
You know I need this.

1469
01:38:36,522 --> 01:38:37,976
You know it'll help.

1470
01:38:40,514 --> 01:38:41,514
No.

1471
01:38:41,793 --> 01:38:43,751
Thank Christ.

1472
01:38:47,033 --> 01:38:48,085
Sorry.

1473
01:38:54,553 --> 01:38:58,277
No? I thought
you'd be into this.

1474
01:38:58,607 --> 01:39:02,877
You did?
What does that say about me?

1475
01:39:03,909 --> 01:39:06,140
Sweetheart, you've done stuff
like this before.

1476
01:39:06,240 --> 01:39:07,829
This should be
no big deal for you.

1477
01:39:08,489 --> 01:39:12,584
You don't want this.
You really don't want this.

1478
01:39:13,007 --> 01:39:18,360
No, I do want this. This has
to happen. Can't you see that?

1479
01:39:18,460 --> 01:39:23,031
I mean, how can you not? No?
What does that say about me?

1480
01:39:23,131 --> 01:39:25,582
You can take it from two guys
whose names you can hardly remember,

1481
01:39:25,682 --> 01:39:29,705
but I ask you to share an experience
about intimacy, and you say no?

1482
01:39:29,805 --> 01:39:34,272
- I can't.
- Baby, yes, you can.

1483
01:39:34,372 --> 01:39:38,589
I'll be there. And when it's over we'll
be the strongest we've ever been...

1484
01:39:38,689 --> 01:39:40,591
'cause we'll have been
through this together.

1485
01:39:40,691 --> 01:39:44,428
Then we'll be on the same level and
there'll be nothing we can't accomplish.

1486
01:39:46,285 --> 01:39:47,873
Oh, Holden.

1487
01:39:49,751 --> 01:39:52,082
That time is over for me.

1488
01:39:52,452 --> 01:39:54,354
I've been there
and I've done it...

1489
01:39:54,454 --> 01:39:56,972
and I didn't find
what I was looking for in any of it.

1490
01:39:57,880 --> 01:40:01,903
I found that it you.
In us.

1491
01:40:02,687 --> 01:40:06,276
Doing this won't help you forget
about the things you're hung up on.

1492
01:40:06,544 --> 01:40:10,537
- It'll create more.
- No. I've thought about all that.

1493
01:40:10,637 --> 01:40:12,631
Yes, it will!

1494
01:40:17,128 --> 01:40:20,182
Maybe you'll see me
differently from then on.

1495
01:40:20,731 --> 01:40:25,360
Maybe you'll despise me for going along
with it once you're in the moment.

1496
01:40:25,855 --> 01:40:27,888
Maybe I'll moan differently,

1497
01:40:27,988 --> 01:40:31,871
and then you'll resent Banky
and become suspicious of us.

1498
01:40:31,971 --> 01:40:34,937
Or you'll alienate him
because of it.

1499
01:40:35,037 --> 01:40:39,925
You'll grow to blame and hate me for
the deterioration of your friendship.

1500
01:40:40,772 --> 01:40:43,987
Or what if... and God,
I sincerely doubt it...

1501
01:40:44,087 --> 01:40:48,467
but what if I saw something
in Banky that I've never seen before,

1502
01:40:49,003 --> 01:40:52,421
you know, and I fell in love
with him and left you?

1503
01:40:53,505 --> 01:40:57,070
I've been down roads
like this before.

1504
01:40:57,726 --> 01:40:59,637
Many times.

1505
01:41:02,681 --> 01:41:07,014
I know you feel doing this
will broaden your horizons...

1506
01:41:07,319 --> 01:41:09,386
and give you experience.

1507
01:41:10,697 --> 01:41:14,523
But I've had
those experiences, on my own.

1508
01:41:15,619 --> 01:41:18,381
And I can't accompany you
on yours.

1509
01:41:19,248 --> 01:41:21,022
I'm past that now.

1510
01:41:27,456 --> 01:41:30,554
Or maybe I just love you
too much.

1511
01:41:31,093 --> 01:41:35,980
And I feel hurt and let down that you
would want to share me with anyone.

1512
01:41:37,259 --> 01:41:40,642
Because I would never
want to share you.

1513
01:41:52,835 --> 01:41:54,630
Regardless,

1514
01:41:55,993 --> 01:41:58,343
I can't be
a part of this.

1515
01:41:59,891 --> 01:42:03,254
Or you.
Not anymore.

1516
01:42:07,091 --> 01:42:08,700
I love you.

1517
01:42:09,694 --> 01:42:11,093
I always will.

1518
01:42:12,558 --> 01:42:14,238
Know that.

1519
01:42:22,131 --> 01:42:24,400
But I'm not
your fucking whore.

1520
01:42:30,218 --> 01:42:31,854
He's yours again.

1521
01:43:30,378 --> 01:43:32,385
A blast from the past.

1522
01:43:32,485 --> 01:43:35,221
Do you know how much it's
going for these days? $110.

1523
01:43:35,321 --> 01:43:37,286
You sign it, it'll
push that up even higher.

1524
01:43:37,386 --> 01:43:39,476
You sell it
I want a kickback.

1525
01:43:40,343 --> 01:43:41,603
I don't know if it's true,

1526
01:43:41,703 --> 01:43:43,889
but I heard once there was
going to be an animated series?

1527
01:43:43,989 --> 01:43:46,128
- There was going to be.
- What happened?

1528
01:43:46,228 --> 01:43:49,214
You're lookin' at it.
No Chronic, no cartoon.

1529
01:43:49,314 --> 01:43:52,634
- That would have been awesome!
- Tell me about it.

1530
01:43:52,734 --> 01:43:55,471
So is that what happened
with you and Holden McNeil?

1531
01:43:55,571 --> 01:43:57,858
You got into a fight over
the rights or something?

1532
01:43:58,003 --> 01:44:01,819
- It was more complicated than that.
- Whatever happened to that guy?

1533
01:44:02,150 --> 01:44:04,313
I don't know.
Quit the biz, I guess.

1534
01:44:04,413 --> 01:44:06,688
So, you guys don't
talk anymore?

1535
01:44:07,307 --> 01:44:09,783
No. Not really.

1536
01:44:10,773 --> 01:44:14,823
Yeah. That happened to me once.
Me and this guy started a comic club.

1537
01:44:14,923 --> 01:44:19,912
And we got into a fight over who looked
better in bare legs, Electra or Robin.

1538
01:44:20,012 --> 01:44:25,751
Anyway, I disbanded the club and struck
out on my own, kinda like Nomad.

1539
01:44:25,851 --> 01:44:29,463
I'm rambling on now.
What I meant to say is...

1540
01:44:29,563 --> 01:44:32,147
that you probably shouldn't
have killed off Chronic.

1541
01:44:32,993 --> 01:44:36,720
Guess not. Some doors just
shouldn't be opened.

1542
01:44:36,820 --> 01:44:39,473
Oh, like the door to death
in Baby Dave's Winter Special,

1543
01:44:39,573 --> 01:44:41,496
which you did on your own.

1544
01:44:41,596 --> 01:44:45,792
See? You don't need that McNeil guy,
anyway. You do great work on your own.

1545
01:44:45,892 --> 01:44:49,963
Look at your line work. Look at all the
detail in this douche bag on page 18.

1546
01:44:50,063 --> 01:44:51,798
Look at how you draw a fart.

1547
01:44:51,898 --> 01:44:55,197
And tell me you're not better off
without Holden McNeil.

1548
01:44:55,297 --> 01:44:57,866
I mean, you were just carrying
that guy like a brown-bag lunch,

1549
01:44:57,966 --> 01:44:59,545
you know what I'm saying?

1550
01:44:59,751 --> 01:45:03,238
- You're so right.
- Yeah, well, the true fans always are.

1551
01:45:03,805 --> 01:45:08,802
Well, keep up the good work, man.
Love those dick jokes. Love 'em.

1552
01:45:11,222 --> 01:45:12,538
See ya.

1553
01:45:16,111 --> 01:45:17,111
Yeah.

1554
01:45:19,813 --> 01:45:20,813
Bye.

1555
01:45:33,494 --> 01:45:35,463
Okay. Who's next?

1556
01:45:37,456 --> 01:45:38,456
Hi.

1557
01:45:45,589 --> 01:45:47,388
Thanks for readin' it.

1558
01:45:48,600 --> 01:45:51,545
I can't believe this place.
These people are so weird.

1559
01:45:51,645 --> 01:45:53,568
You wanted to come.

1560
01:45:53,668 --> 01:45:55,958
God, I can't believe you call
these people contemporaries.

1561
01:45:56,058 --> 01:45:58,594
Look at this guy over here
with the pointy ears? What's that?

1562
01:45:58,694 --> 01:46:00,596
- He's a Vulcan.
- A what?

1563
01:46:00,696 --> 01:46:03,036
A Vulcan. Jesus, potzer.

1564
01:46:03,136 --> 01:46:05,601
Why don't you take a walk
and get us something to drink?

1565
01:46:05,701 --> 01:46:07,111
Okay, I will.

1566
01:46:26,005 --> 01:46:27,998
Um, this isn't
one of mine.

1567
01:46:28,443 --> 01:46:29,619
It's mine.

1568
01:46:31,677 --> 01:46:33,333
I saved you a copy.

1569
01:46:37,335 --> 01:46:38,335
Hi.

1570
01:46:39,522 --> 01:46:40,522
Hi.

1571
01:46:42,411 --> 01:46:43,875
How've you been?

1572
01:46:44,783 --> 01:46:48,187
Uh, good. Really good.
Yourself?

1573
01:46:48,538 --> 01:46:49,538
Good.

1574
01:46:56,702 --> 01:47:00,071
The new issue's selling
like crazy, for some reason.

1575
01:47:00,710 --> 01:47:04,076
Yeah, well, it's because it's
really good. I liked it a lot.

1576
01:47:04,548 --> 01:47:06,086
Thank you.

1577
01:47:08,714 --> 01:47:11,375
I haven't even seen this yet.
Did it just come out?

1578
01:47:11,644 --> 01:47:14,983
Uh, oh, about a month ago.
I did a really small run.

1579
01:47:15,083 --> 01:47:17,421
Self-financed,
only about 500 issues.

1580
01:47:17,731 --> 01:47:19,892
Will I enjoy it?

1581
01:47:21,101 --> 01:47:23,837
You might.
It's familiar subject matter.

1582
01:47:41,121 --> 01:47:43,829
Looks like
a very personal story.

1583
01:47:49,626 --> 01:47:52,174
I finally had
something personal to say.

1584
01:47:57,179 --> 01:48:00,695
Well, I'm gonna go.
I don't wanna hold up your line here.

1585
01:48:01,014 --> 01:48:02,014
Yeah.

1586
01:48:03,077 --> 01:48:07,884
I mean, it can get ugly. I just saw
this nun call a small child a cunt-rag.

1587
01:48:16,199 --> 01:48:19,025
You know, read that,
if you have a minute.

1588
01:48:19,541 --> 01:48:20,614
I will.

1589
01:48:24,456 --> 01:48:28,103
If you get the chance, call me. I'd like
to hear your thoughts, or... whatever.

1590
01:48:29,939 --> 01:48:30,939
Okay.

1591
01:48:33,799 --> 01:48:34,799
Okay.

1592
01:48:38,053 --> 01:48:39,965
It was really nice
seeing you again.

1593
01:48:41,183 --> 01:48:43,475
It was really nice
to see you too.

1594
01:48:57,151 --> 01:49:00,246
- Who was that?
- Huh?

1595
01:49:00,555 --> 01:49:02,244
Who was that?

1596
01:49:12,171 --> 01:49:15,822
Oh, just some guy I knew.

1597
01:49:29,563 --> 01:49:33,069
Next. So, what do you want
to do tonight?

1598
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:40,056
I was tappin' my foot
on a Friday night

1599
01:49:40,156 --> 01:49:45,102
To my favorite band
I was pushed aside

1600
01:49:45,202 --> 01:49:50,107
I said hey, don't push me
No, no, no one pushes me

1601
01:49:50,207 --> 01:49:55,112
When I was face to face
with a woman I admired

1602
01:49:55,212 --> 01:49:57,623
And she gave me this look

1603
01:49:57,748 --> 01:50:00,076
I could not believe

1604
01:50:00,176 --> 01:50:05,298
And the cold stare remained
I wanted to leave

1605
01:50:07,717 --> 01:50:12,963
Yeah, I do believe anger
is offset by sorrow

1606
01:50:13,063 --> 01:50:17,843
But you destroy today
you might regret tomorrow

1607
01:50:17,943 --> 01:50:20,534
When you're young
and defensive

1608
01:50:20,634 --> 01:50:22,932
It comes off offensive

1609
01:50:23,032 --> 01:50:27,916
And it's hard to repay the
tolerance that you borrowed

1610
01:50:28,016 --> 01:50:33,150
The lasting relationship
sinks right off the pier

1611
01:50:33,250 --> 01:50:37,830
Who wears the pants
It's faded but clear

1612
01:50:40,333 --> 01:50:44,766
She's your girlfriend
and she ain't too fond of me

1613
01:50:44,866 --> 01:50:50,543
I guess if that's the way
it was meant to be

1614
01:50:50,643 --> 01:50:55,506
There we were
just we three

1615
01:50:55,606 --> 01:50:59,268
You, your girlfriend and me

1616
01:51:22,333 --> 01:51:27,267
I've known you forever
You two just met

1617
01:51:27,367 --> 01:51:31,917
So easily amused
how fast we forget

1618
01:51:32,017 --> 01:51:37,110
Ain't my jealousy
my self-righteous greed

1619
01:51:37,210 --> 01:51:41,948
She's a bit like a book
I'm too farsighted to read

1620
01:51:42,048 --> 01:51:47,016
And I wish you the best
but sometimes feel the need

1621
01:51:47,116 --> 01:51:50,716
To say
Remember me

1622
01:51:53,823 --> 01:51:59,195
Yeah, she's your girlfriend
as far as we can see

1623
01:51:59,295 --> 01:52:04,179
Does she look at you
the way she looks at me

1624
01:52:04,279 --> 01:52:09,330
And here we are
just we three

1625
01:52:09,430 --> 01:52:13,926
You, your girlfriend and me

1626
01:52:16,220 --> 01:52:21,050
She's your girlfriend
it's gettin' harder to see

1627
01:52:21,150 --> 01:52:25,930
Better just take her home
Better just let her be

1628
01:52:26,030 --> 01:52:31,235
When she walks out that door
you come looking for me

1629
01:52:45,333 --> 01:52:47,856
Man, what do you always have
to tell that fuckin' gay story for?

1630
01:52:47,956 --> 01:52:50,546
- Man, shut up.
- You shut up, you fat fuck.
