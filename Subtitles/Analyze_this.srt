1
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,190
1957 was a big year.

2
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:52,020
The Russians put that Sputnik into outer space.

3
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,130
The Dodgers played their last game at Ebbets Field...

4
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:56,770
...and said goodbye to Brooklyn.

5
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:00,700
That guy. he shot Frank Costello in the head and missed.

6
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:05,100
The Gallo brothers whacked Albert Anastasia in that barbershop.

7
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,140
It was total chaos.

8
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,970
With Anastasia out. Vito Genovese figures he 's the big boss.

9
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,410
But Carlo Gambino...

10
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,850
...and Joe Bananas had other ideas.

11
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:16,650
So they called a meeting.

12
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,590
A big meeting.

13
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:32,500
It was the first time the whole Commission would meet face to face.

14
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,670
Bosses and wiseguys were coming from all over the country...

15
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,870
...and all the New York families too.

16
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,640
Maybe 50 bosses. the whole wiseguy world...

17
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,680
...all coming to this little town upstate.

18
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,930
My father went with Dom Manetta and Tommy D. Fat Tommy.

19
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:58,820
He was running the family then.

20
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:02,860
Some asshole thought it would be a good idea to have this meeting...

21
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:06,400
...at Joe Barbara 's farm. up in the country. nice and quiet.

22
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,870
Get away from the car.

23
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:14,180
Want to be a fucking rib eye? Get away from the car!

24
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,940
Turns out the local cops were watching Joe Barbara like a hawk...

25
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:23,420
...and some deputy sheriff notices all the traffic and calls the feds.

26
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,030
The meeting never even got started.

27
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,700
The feds moved in...

28
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:43,170
...and bingo. the bosses. they moved out.

29
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:06,030
My father and Dominic. they hid in the field with some hay or corn.

30
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,360
Along comes a farmer.

31
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,800
Dominic bullshits him while my father holds out...

32
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,700
... this.44 cannon he used to carry. and hijacked the tractor.

33
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,770
The story is they drove it all the way to Bensonhurst...

34
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:23,570
...but my father told me they only got as far as Poughkeepsie.

35
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,920
Carlo Gambino. he came out of it...

36
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,390
...capo di tutti capi, boss of all bosses...

37
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:36,890
...and that was the last time the Commission tried to meet until now.

38
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:49,170
I don ' t know, I don ' t Iike it. What do we got to meet for?

39
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:52,380
Let everybody else worry about their own business.

40
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:56,950
The ' 57 meeting was about how we were going to divide this country.

41
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:00,220
This meeting is how we' re going to survive.

42
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:05,420
You got made guys informing for the feds.

43
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,820
Bosses are going to jail.

44
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,990
People are getting whacked without permission.

45
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,590
And on top of everything else...

46
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,360
...you got these Chinese...

47
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:17,130
...and these crazy Russians to deal with.

48
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,060
Everything is changing.

49
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:21,970
We got to change with the times.

50
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,230
Are we going to get a fucking Website?

51
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,840
When your papa died...

52
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:32,140
...I made him a promise that I'd always Iook out for you.

53
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,640
I want you to come to that meeting with me.

54
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,150
Capisci?

55
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,460
Listen. This guy, Primo Sindone, you watch out for him.

56
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,400
He's a scumbag.

57
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,370
Keep your eye on him, okay?

58
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,940
Let me get a toothpick. I'II be right there.

59
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:33,710
I just kept telling him that I needed room...

60
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,000
...to grow...

61
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:40,580
...and to find myself as a person.

62
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:43,480
You know? Not just as a woman...

63
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:46,420
...but as an independent entity.

64
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:50,560
Then I told him I needed to get in touch with my uniqueness...

65
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,990
...but he could not handle that.

66
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:56,270
He said that I was driving him away.

67
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:59,540
He said I was driving him away.

68
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:04,370
Do you think I was driving him away, Dr. Sobol?

69
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:08,170
Caroline, things end.

70
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,880
It's a part of Iife. It's how we deal with things ending that's important.

71
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,350
I just cannot believe...

72
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:17,390
...that it's over between me and Steve, you know?

73
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:19,780
I mean, maybe there's still hope.

74
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,550
He took out a restraining order against you.

75
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,090
I have to be honest, that's usually not a good sign.

76
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,460
But what should I do?

77
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,730
The first thing that I think you should do...

78
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,970
...is to stop whining about this pathetic Ioser. For chrissakes!

79
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,830
You are a tragedy queen!

80
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,810
Steve doesn't Iike me. Steve doesn't respect me.

81
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:45,140
Who gives a shit? Get a fucking Iife!

82
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,380
Dr. Sobol?

83
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,680
I was reflecting on your situation.

84
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:59,120
It's interesting what you were saying.

85
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,730
I want you to think about it.

86
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:03,330
And I'm going to think about it.

87
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:04,900
We'II both think about it...

88
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:10,000
...and continue next week when I get back from vacation.

89
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,710
Caroline, what are you feeling?

90
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:18,540
You're just Iike Steve. You just want to...

91
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,150
You just want to...

92
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:22,150
...get rid of me and throw me out.

93
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,980
You know that's not true.

94
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,210
Yes, it's true.

95
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,860
I'II see you next week...

96
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,620
...whereas Steve never wants to see you again.

97
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,500
PIease, Mr. Vitti.

98
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,610
I said I don't know nothing, but they don't believe me...

99
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:45,610
...because that time I said Little Joe hit Dukey and he didn't.

100
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:48,640
I didn't know because Little Joe Iooked just Iike that...

101
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:50,210
Shut the fuck up!

102
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,880
You know me, right?

103
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,110
You're Mr. Vitti.

104
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,310
You know what I'II do to you if you Iie?

105
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:00,620
You'II crack me on the head with that pipe.

106
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:03,260
It's a rhetorical question, you idiot.

107
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,120
I'II ask you one time only: Who killed Dominic?

108
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:07,990
-Who killed Dominic? -I don't know!

109
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,220
-Who killed Dominic? -I don't know!

110
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:11,440
I swear to God...

111
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,800
Don't fucking Iie!

112
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,340
You Iittle motherfucker! Who killed Dom?

113
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:27,750
He don't know nothing. Forget it.

114
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,390
That was relatively painless.

115
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:37,560
Shut the fuck up!

116
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,690
That hurt.

117
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,570
We're not going anywhere.

118
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:46,830
We've sat here for ten minutes. I hate being Iate.

119
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,900
I hate walking into that house Iate.

120
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:49,970
Dad, relax.

121
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:53,470
You're Iike this because you're mad we have to go to Grandpa's.

122
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,270
PIease don't analyze me.

123
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,940
I can't be analyzed by somebody who, until recently, believed in Santa.

124
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:01,910
There is one Dr. Sobol in this family. Just one.

125
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:05,850
But there's two. There's you and there's Grandpa.

126
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:09,350
You know what? Let's talk about something else.

127
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,530
Will you read Grandpa's new book?

128
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,200
Mom says you won't because you're jealous.

129
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:21,770
Does your mother talk about anything else, or is it just me 24 hours a day?

130
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:22,960
Shit!

131
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,570
This is Iike voodoo, your mother knows where I am every second.

132
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,440
Get in!

133
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:35,350
If I point to you, make believe your neck hurts.

134
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,310
What are you, a moron?

135
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,280
I' m sorry. This was my fault.

136
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:40,550
Did you see anything?

137
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,320
-I was talking to my son. -Bullshit!

138
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,690
That's all right, sir.

139
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:46,360
It's our fault for being in front of you.

140
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,030
No, really. Listen to me.

141
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:51,130
I'm responsible. Here's my insurance information.

142
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,430
It's okay. Forget about it.

143
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,500
Forget about...? Your rear end is screwed up.

144
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:57,730
No, it was Iike that before.

145
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:01,400
Let's call the police and file a report.

146
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,710
Fuck the police.

147
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,110
Hear me?

148
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,910
Okay. Fuck them.

149
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,210
You're right. Fuck them.

150
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,880
Especially those mounted cops who Ieave big piles all over...

151
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:17,420
...and you just step in it up to your shins.

152
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,250
Let me give you my card...

153
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:22,090
...in case you Iook at the damage and change your mind.

154
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,500
You a doctor?

155
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,670
I'm a psychiatrist.

156
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:26,840
A shrink.

157
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,930
I talked to a shrink one time.

158
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,570
When I got sent upstate on a...

159
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,140
...fishing trip.

160
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,610
Jelly! Let's go! Come on.

161
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:37,640
I got to go.

162
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,780
I'II see you.

163
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,220
Pings and knocks.

164
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,480
Cheap gas. What are you going to do?

165
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,060
-Take it easy, doc. -Right.

166
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,330
Neurotics only!

167
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:10,140
You must have been a beautiful baby

168
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,120
'Cause baby. Iook at you now

169
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,840
Thank God for Prozac

170
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,650
Baby. Iook at you now

171
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,790
You' re not coming? I mean, this is my wedding.

172
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,060
We understand it's a special day for you, Benny...

173
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:31,670
...but your father and I can't just pick up and Ieave town...

174
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,930
...every time you decide to get married.

175
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,300
Every time? This is a once in a Iifetime...

176
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,740
Twice in a Iifetime thing, Mom.

177
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:41,840
Dad, you're not coming to my wedding?

178
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:45,140
We want to, but I have three book signings next weekend.

179
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:47,610
I can't piss off these big bookstores.

180
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:51,350
If I cancel, they stick me on the bottom shelves. That's how they are.

181
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,780
That's the word on the street.

182
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,360
Barnes is okay, but Noble is a vindictive prick.

183
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,120
Ben. The Ianguage.

184
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,590
I'm sorry, but Iisten.

185
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,860
I have been alone for eight years.

186
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:04,600
I finally found somebody that I want to spend my Iife with.

187
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,130
At Ieast meet her before we get married.

188
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,030
You are going to be her family.

189
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,230
I think she should know that up front.

190
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,930
You're being very hostile.

191
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,870
I was joking.

192
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,050
I think I'II go talk to the mayor.

193
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,980
The mayor is here?

194
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,350
What's wrong?

195
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,080
Nothing. Everything's fine.

196
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:24,720
How's your practice?

197
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:27,050
Excellent. I have interesting patients.

198
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:30,160
Very interesting. Fascinating, actually.

199
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,950
Dad has a patient who dreams he shits trout.

200
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:35,860
Thanks, Mike.

201
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:40,740
The Manetta family is bound to ask questions.

202
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,070
They think we put the hit out on Dominic.

203
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,370
Forget Dominic. They were after Paul.

204
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,010
It's a miracle you survived. I just thank God.

205
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,140
Yeah, thank God, all right.

206
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:54,440
If it wasn't because I had to go back for that toothpick...

207
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,750
...I'd be Iying dead with Dominic, God forbid.

208
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,320
May he rest in peace.

209
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,010
This is about the big meeting.

210
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,560
Primo Sindone wants to run the whole show.

211
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,280
Primo's a boss. He knows the rules.

212
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,190
He couldn't come after them unless he had permission from the families.

213
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,660
If they did, we're headed for one big war, I can tell you that.

214
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:14,840
Find out what you can. We got two weeks.

215
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,840
God forbid the other New York bosses are against us.

216
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,480
I want to know that before I go into that meeting.

217
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,510
Sure.

218
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,880
You all right? You don't Iook too good.

219
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:30,050
What's the matter?

220
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,580
I'm a Iittle choked up. I'm going to get some air.

221
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,050
-Take it easy. -Take some air.

222
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,030
You all right?

223
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,200
What?

224
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:53,940
I feel Iike shit.

225
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,910
This whole thing is Iike one big fucking headache.

226
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,480
You having one of them "mindgraines"?

227
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,390
-Let's go for a ride. -What's the matter?

228
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:08,990
-Just drive the car. -What happened?

229
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:24,200
Good news, Mr. Evans. Your heart is just fine.

230
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,800
"Just fine"?

231
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:29,100
But I had eight heart attacks in the Iast three weeks.

232
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:32,140
Based on everything, I'd say you had an anxiety attack.

233
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,440
A what?

234
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,350
An anxiety attack. A panic attack.

235
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,610
I'II give you Xanax.

236
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,580
An anxiety attack? What are you saying?

237
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,150
It's a common thing.

238
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,020
Hey, Iook at me.

239
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:44,520
Do I Iook Iike a guy who panics?

240
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,590
-Do I Iook Iike I panic? -It's nothing to be ashamed of.

241
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,240
Where'd you go to medical school? I got a fucking heart attack.

242
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,060
Not according to your EIKG.

243
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:10,450
Jelly, I need you to do something for me as a friend.

244
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:11,480
Yeah, anything.

245
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,920
-I need you to find me a doctor. -We just come from the doctor.

246
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:17,390
Not that kind of doctor. Like a head doctor.

247
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,960
You going to change your face Iike Sonny BIack?

248
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,190
Don't get his nose. He Iooks Iike a pig.

249
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,800
Not a plastic surgeon. I got to spell everything out for you?

250
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,400
It saves time.

251
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,930
I mean, Iike a head doctor. Like a psychiatrist.

252
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,910
This is Iike one of them psychic, ESPN...

253
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,610
...ESPN things, you know?

254
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:44,350
I just ran into a psychiatrist. Actually, he ran into me.

255
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,950
Was he any good?

256
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,150
He seemed Iike a smart guy. He had a business card.

257
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,520
A business card? That's a real fucking achievement.

258
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,330
What do you need a shrink for?

259
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,440
It's not for me. It's for my friend.

260
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,130
He has problems. I'II ask the shrink questions...

261
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,110
...and get some answers for my friend.

262
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:08,900
And nobody can know. God forbid...

263
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:11,340
...somebody hears I been talking to a shrink.

264
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,040
It could be interpreted wrong.

265
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,310
Know what I mean?

266
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,550
No one will ever know.

267
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,350
-Could I just ask one question? -Go ahead.

268
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,050
This friend...

269
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:22,790
...is it me?

270
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,550
Yeah, it's you.

271
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,970
Carl, I'm detecting a pattern. You settle too easily for things.

272
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,400
You're right. I do.

273
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:38,670
See, you just did it again.

274
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,740
I suggested something and you immediately agreed.

275
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,200
You're right. I did.

276
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,750
Why do you do this?

277
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:47,420
I don't know.

278
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,920
I think it's your fear of rejection or disapproval.

279
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,420
You don't have to worry about that.

280
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,490
Be your own man. Stand your ground.

281
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:58,360
You don't have to Iet people roll over you.

282
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,390
Dr. Sobol?

283
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,760
Excuse me, we're in session.

284
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,960
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

285
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:06,560
I know you. You're the guy I hit Iast night.

286
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:08,700
Bingo. Get out of here.

287
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,610
Upsy-daisy. Got a coat, nutbar?

288
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:12,870
-What are you doing? -He's Ieaving.

289
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:15,870
He's not going till he's done with his session.

290
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:18,380
-I'II give you $ 1 00 to Ieave. -Don't take it.

291
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,840
-Make it $ 1 50. -Listen.

292
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,350
He ain't that fucking crazy.

293
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,850
You were right. I stood my ground.

294
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,290
-This was the wrong time. -I got him up from $ 1 50.

295
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,260
-I'm proud of you. -I feel Iike a new man.

296
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,690
I'm so happy.

297
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,060
I know you're upset about the car, but you can't come in here.

298
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,290
This is a patient's private session.

299
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,700
You know me?

300
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:43,370
-Yes. -No, you don't.

301
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,010
You see my picture in the paper?

302
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,910
-Yes. -No, you didn't.

303
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,810
I don't even get the paper.

304
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,110
Jelly, wait outside.

305
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,490
Sit down.

306
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,220
You ain't got no bugs in here?

307
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:11,260
Bugs?

308
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,370
Bugs. Recording equipment.

309
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,830
No. I don't record. I take notes.

310
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:22,000
I tried to give him the insurance information several times.

311
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,340
Seriously, several times.

312
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,780
He wouldn't take it.

313
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,240
PIease don't kill me.

314
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,580
I was going to ask you if you Iiked T ony Bennett.

315
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,750
I'm a big T ony Bennett fan.

316
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:34,660
Me too.

317
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,790
I Iike all Italian singers.

318
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,260
I know it's not your fault...

319
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:43,260
...but shouldn't we take this up with our insurance companies?

320
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,770
It ain't about that. I don't care about the car.

321
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:48,030
I got a friend of mine....

322
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,230
He's got problems, and he'II have to probably see a shrink.

323
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,100
So I'II ask you a couple of questions.

324
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,310
Go ahead, then.

325
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:00,320
What do we do? What, we sit?

326
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,280
Whatever makes you comfortable.

327
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:03,540
I'II sit over here.

328
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,220
I'm going to sit here.

329
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:09,620
If you're comfortable, it's fine.

330
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,630
So who starts?

331
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:21,330
T ell me why you think you need therapy.

332
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:25,370
I don't need therapy. I told you that. It's for my friend.

333
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,310
-I'm sorry. -You didn't hear me say that?

334
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:28,440
I'm sorry.

335
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:32,640
You're supposed to be good at Iistening. You can't remember what I said?

336
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:34,040
So sorry.

337
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,740
I ain't thrilled with the Ievel of service up to this point.

338
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,820
That was my fault. I apologize.

339
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,450
Why don't we start over?

340
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,590
Why don't you just tell me about your friend?

341
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:52,170
This friend, you know, he's a very powerful guy.

342
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,260
Never had trouble dealing with nothing.

343
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,840
AII of a sudden, he's falling apart...

344
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,940
...he cries for no reason, he can't sleep...

345
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:01,940
...he can't be with his friends.

346
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:04,550
AII of a sudden, he gets nervous around them.

347
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,310
He wants to get away from them.

348
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:09,580
And these are guys he knows his whole Iife, you know?

349
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,720
And then he has these attacks.

350
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,020
He can't breathe, he gets dizzy...

351
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,560
...chest pains, you know....

352
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:21,450
He thinks he's going to die or something.

353
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:22,860
Panic attacks.

354
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,860
What's it with you guys and panic attacks?

355
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,590
Who said "panic"?

356
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,000
Who said "panic"?

357
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:29,260
Not panic.

358
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:32,000
Dizzy, chest-breathing, constricting...

359
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,010
...attacks.

360
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,870
This guy, he just wants to know what he can do to make it stop.

361
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,740
I'm going out on a Iimb here.

362
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,650
I think your friend...

363
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,750
...is you.

364
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,440
You got a gift, my friend.

365
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:03,370
You got a gift.

366
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:08,310
You saw that there was something I was trying to do...

367
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:11,070
...and figured it out. That's why you are who you are.

368
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,480
God bless you. You got a fucking gift.

369
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,840
-No, I don't. -Yes, you do.

370
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:17,420
-No, I don't. -Yes, you do.

371
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,180
Go on.

372
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:22,090
-What? -Go on.

373
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:24,150
I think...

374
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:26,690
...medication could help.

375
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,090
Drugs?

376
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:30,130
Can't do drugs. I don't do drugs.

377
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,870
If you want to get to the root of the problem...

378
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,900
...you'II want to get some form of therapy.

379
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:38,040
Like what? With you or something?

380
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:41,370
Me? No, I don't think you want...

381
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:44,350
My roster of patients is full.

382
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:48,110
I'm full right now. PIus, I'm Ieaving on a short vacation.

383
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,310
Where you going?

384
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:51,980
-I don't share that with patients. -Where?

385
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:54,780
Sheraton Bal Harbour Hotel in Miami Beach.

386
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,530
That wasn't so hard, was it?

387
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:58,220
No, it wasn't.

388
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,970
You know, it's a funny kind of a thing...

389
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:07,400
...but I feel better after I got all that off my chest.

390
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,160
I feel Iike a Ioad...

391
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:11,340
...a Ioad is off my shoulders.

392
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,500
You're good.

393
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,540
Doc, thank you.

394
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,340
-I didn't do anything. -You did.

395
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,840
-I did nothing. -You did too.

396
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:22,310
The Ioad, gone. Where is it?

397
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,820
Don't know.

398
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,290
You're good.

399
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:28,590
You're good, Doc.

400
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,890
I'II be getting in touch with you.

401
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:33,430
-Don't, please. -One more thing.

402
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,930
If I talk to you and you turn me into a fag...

403
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:38,260
...I'II kill you. Understand?

404
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:42,170
Could we define "fag"? Because some feelings...

405
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:44,670
-...may come up. -I go fag, you die. Got it?

406
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,860
Simple.

407
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:48,170
You're good, Doc.

408
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,940
You're good.

409
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,510
See you, Doc.

410
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,990
We take on Manetta, what does Vitti do? Nothing.

411
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,430
Why doesn't he move?

412
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,730
Fuck him.

413
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:15,770
You say "fuck him," but he's planning something big.

414
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:17,100
This shit's coming down.

415
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,930
Well then, Iet it come down.

416
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,000
Let me tell you, Vitti's a tough guy...

417
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:24,870
...but a Iot of tough guys get fed to the crabs off Red Hook.

418
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:28,710
Vitti. That name has been haunting me since I was a kid.

419
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,820
Growing up, he was the smart guy, I was the dope.

420
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:35,120
My father was a nickel-and-dime shitheel, his had it all.

421
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,490
Vito Genovese blew it at Apalachin...

422
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:40,750
...because he forgot to kill Gambino before the meeting.

423
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,900
I won't make that same mistake. I want Paul Vitti dead!

424
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,730
You hear me? I want him dead. Not breathing now. Dead!

425
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:51,110
Like the pants?

426
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:53,600
They Iook great. He's some tailor.

427
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,400
I'II tell you. Look good.

428
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:56,440
I Iike them.

429
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,790
Don't Ieave food in your room. I won't come home to a science fair.

430
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,450
I didn't.

431
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,860
Dad, one thing, though.

432
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,290
-"I go fag, you die." -That's it.

433
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,090
I'm sealing the vent in your room.

434
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,030
You cannot Iisten to my sessions!

435
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,830
It's so cool. Was that really Paul Vitti?

436
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:21,300
I didn't ask to see his Mafia decoder ring, but it was him.

437
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:24,960
-Are you going to treat him? -Of course not. Are you crazy?

438
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:29,070
You cannot tell anybody that he was here. Understand?

439
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,040
Should I take it off the Internet?

440
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,310
I' m kidding.

441
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:44,590
Despite the heat and the popularity of more exotic Caribbean destinations...

442
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:47,990
...Florida 's hospitality industry reports booming business...

443
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,960
...from Orlando to the Keys.

444
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:51,500
Judging from the mob...

445
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,030
...around the pool here today...

446
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:57,300
... there 's nothing off about the off-season in Miami Beach this summer.

447
00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:01,810
On a personal note, this is my Iast report for WVBF.

448
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:04,850
I' m marrying a wonderful man, and I' m moving to New Y ork.

449
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,740
Thanks for everything. Miami.

450
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:10,850
For the last time. this is Laura MacNamara for WVBF.

451
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:13,590
Catch!

452
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,520
We' re clear! Nice, Laura.

453
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,940
Everybody! This is him! This is the guy!

454
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:32,370
-I missed you so much. -I missed you too.

455
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,700
-Michael, say hi. -Hi, Laura.

456
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:37,140
Hi, Michael. How are you?

457
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,910
You want to go Iook at the camera?

458
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,280
Why would I want to go Iook at the camera?

459
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,720
-Is it okay? -Yeah, go ahead.

460
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,120
Don't worry if you break anything. I'm out of here.

461
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,830
-You think he Iikes me? -He's crazy about you. No, he is.

462
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:57,090
I Iove you. I'm so glad to be with you.

463
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,800
Do you really? And do you really Iove me?

464
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,970
Of course. What's the matter?

465
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:04,570
-I'm nervous. -Why?

466
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,670
Because I'm going to be a stepmom to a grown kid...

467
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,240
...and we're getting married.

468
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,310
So what are you worried about?

469
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:13,180
What if you get tired of me?

470
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:16,250
A Iot of couples are very happy and then they marry...

471
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:18,750
...and completely Iose interest in each other.

472
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:20,720
That won't happen to us.

473
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:37,760
Is everything okay, Paul?

474
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:40,600
Will you stop talking? I'm trying to do this here.

475
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:43,740
-You seem distracted. -I am.

476
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,110
I got things on my mind.

477
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:47,540
-Would you stop talking? -I'm sorry.

478
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:48,740
Lie down.

479
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:53,550
Thinking about your wife?

480
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,280
I wasn't thinking about my wife. What are you talking about?

481
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,360
Now I am thinking about my wife.

482
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:12,300
Sheila, why can't you keep your mouth shut?

483
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,370
Sorry.

484
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,110
Dr. Sobol.

485
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:28,120
Mom?

486
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,290
It's me.

487
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:36,230
Mr. Vitti wants to see you. I got your robe.

488
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:42,690
I got news for you, you two-bit prick, son of a bitch rat bastard...

489
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:45,970
...you did nothing for me! Whatever you did, it didn't take.

490
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,440
I'm still fucked up. You did nothing for me!

491
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:52,010
I did nothing for you? I saw you for five minutes.

492
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,550
What do you expect?

493
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:57,020
I can't work miracles. Let me tell you something else.

494
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:59,690
I don't Iike it when someone breaks in...

495
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:01,910
...and kidnaps me in the middle of the night!

496
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:03,680
I have a family. I have a Iife.

497
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:05,590
And I have a serious practice.

498
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,360
And I don't have time for your bullshit!

499
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:11,290
That got away from me at the end there.

500
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,030
I couldn't get it up Iast night.

501
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,500
Do you mean sexually?

502
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:20,540
I mean for the game against Michigan State.

503
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,010
Of course, sexually! What's the matter with you?

504
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,640
Can I get this straight?

505
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:28,220
You flew 1 500 miles, you dragged me out of bed...

506
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:30,510
...because you couldn't get an erection?

507
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,810
Don't that prove I'm motivated?

508
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,920
You can take a pill for that.

509
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,090
That's a cheat.

510
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:38,760
You start with the pills, next it's hydraulics.

511
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,930
A hard-on should be gotten Iegitimately or not at all.

512
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,900
I think Mark Twain said that.

513
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:45,970
Are you going to help me or not?

514
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,600
I don't believe this. AII right.

515
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:52,710
Has this happened before?

516
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:54,430
The dead dick thing?

517
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:58,140
Never. Well, one time. Last night.

518
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,140
One more time.

519
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,210
So twice.

520
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:03,220
Do the math. Two times.

521
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:07,250
Then another time, but after a big meal, so that don't count.

522
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:10,430
Being unable to perform three or four times is not...

523
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,820
Eight times.

524
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:14,120
Eight times is not catastrophic.

525
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:15,990
Maybe not to you. Look at you.

526
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:19,960
But if I can't get it up, that makes me Iess of a man.

527
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:22,100
In my world, I deal with animals.

528
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:25,070
They may seem dumb to an educated guy Iike you...

529
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,340
...but animals are very cunning and they sense weakness.

530
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,410
I got Iess than two weeks...

531
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:33,210
...to get strong, or they'II eat me up, if they don't kill me.

532
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,470
What happens in two weeks?

533
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,680
I can't tell you. You don't want to know.

534
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:40,010
You can't tell me and I don't want to know. That's a big help.

535
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,210
You're supposed to tell me. I do want to know.

536
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:44,790
That's how this works. This is impossible.

537
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:48,160
I can't do anything in two weeks, and even if I could...

538
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,630
...what is my goal? To make you a happy, well-adjusted gangster?

539
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,630
The other day I was watching a TV commercial...

540
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:56,600
...some kid playing with puppies.

541
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:58,600
I cried for 45 minutes.

542
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,840
SIap a pair of tits on me, I'm a woman.

543
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,070
I can't help you.

544
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,470
You're turning me down?

545
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:07,880
When I got into family therapy, this wasn't the family I had in mind.

546
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,520
You with your schmucky Iittle office and house, you're turning me down?

547
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,120
So you can Iisten to housewives piss and moan...

548
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:17,450
...about nobody fucks them right anymore?

549
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,920
I'm Ieaving now.

550
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:20,190
You see this?

551
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,090
This is what I'm talking about.

552
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,890
I'm a dead man.

553
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:29,570
You call yourself a doctor. You should be ashamed of yourself.

554
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:35,410
A real doctor could never turn his back on a person who's suffering!

555
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:40,810
You couldn't treat a fucking two-celled amoeba, you fucking phony.

556
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:47,680
Mother of God, give me the strength to get through this.

557
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:49,690
This fucking rat bastard...

558
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:51,260
...won't help me.

559
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:56,860
I start crying all the time. Don't know what it is.

560
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:58,700
AII right, here.

561
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,430
Sit down.

562
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:07,370
Sit down.

563
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,940
What happened with your wife Iast night?

564
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:16,680
I wasn't with my wife. I was with my girlfriend.

565
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:18,550
Are you having marriage problems?

566
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,690
Why do you have a girlfriend?

567
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:22,410
You're moralizing with me now?

568
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:25,120
No, I'm curious. Why do you have a girlfriend?

569
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:27,560
I do things with her I can't do with my wife.

570
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,160
Why can't you do them with your wife?

571
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:32,700
That's the mouth she kisses my kids with. Are you crazy?

572
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,870
Have you been under stress Iately?

573
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:40,100
-Like seeing your best friend murdered? -That would qualify.

574
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,140
I got a Iot of stress.

575
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:49,220
Based upon what you told me before about the attacks...

576
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,150
...I'd say that was probably it.

577
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,880
-Just stress? -"Just stress"?

578
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:55,890
Stress is a very powerful force.

579
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:58,990
I doubt there's anything physically wrong with you.

580
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,100
-That's it? -That's it.

581
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:02,960
That's it?

582
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:04,330
I think so.

583
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,440
You're very good, you.

584
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:09,970
You are very good.

585
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:12,300
-There's more to it than... -You're very good.

586
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:14,480
-There are underlying... -Understand me?

587
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,110
You're right on the money.

588
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,870
I feel the juices rush back to my balls as we speak.

589
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,570
I never thought I'd hear another man say that to me.

590
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:23,950
That settles it. You are my shrink.

591
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:25,680
No, I couldn't.

592
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:27,380
You're not ready to open up.

593
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,390
You're not a good candidate...

594
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:32,620
Listen to you. The fucking honesty.

595
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,090
That's it. You don't understand.

596
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,700
Nobody, nobody talks to me Iike that.

597
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,330
You understand?

598
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:40,020
-Yes, I do. -That's it.

599
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,330
Let's do it. I'm ready.

600
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,440
You don't hear the word "no" very often.

601
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,870
I hear it all the time, only it's more, "No, please, no, no."

602
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,200
I'm here for two more days.

603
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:52,680
When I get back to New York, I'II treat you exclusively.

604
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,110
For two weeks.

605
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:56,940
I just don't know what to tell my patients.

606
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:58,850
You want me to clear your schedule?

607
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,890
It would be my honor to do that. My pleasure.

608
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,530
Not Jimmy. I will do this myself.

609
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:05,850
-You sure? -Positive.

610
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,720
I will see you in New York.

611
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:10,900
Okay. Want one of them?

612
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:12,190
-No, thanks. -Sure?

613
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,390
That's very kind of you, but I....

614
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,730
Want to give a Iittle sta minch?

615
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:18,640
You sure?

616
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,970
The pause that refreshes.

617
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,840
I don't... No, I really....

618
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,180
You're on vacation.

619
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,250
I'm also about to get married...

620
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:28,940
...so I'd Iike to go back to my hotel and....

621
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:29,980
Good night.

622
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:31,410
I'II see you in New York.

623
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,210
You. Hey, Doc. You.

624
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:36,360
I'm going to see a Iot of you.

625
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,290
Where were you?

626
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,460
My God, I woke up and you were gone!

627
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:45,330
There was no note or anything! I was out of my mind!

628
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,800
I walked all over the hotel Iooking for you.

629
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,060
I even ate a Rice Krispy Treat. I almost called the police.

630
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:54,180
No, don't call the police. I'II tell you the truth.

631
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,310
I had a patient emergency.

632
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:58,570
You have patients in FIorida?

633
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:02,480
One. He followed me from New York. I had to go, trust me.

634
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:04,650
My God. Who is this patient?

635
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:08,120
Paul Vitti.

636
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,890
Mafia Paul Vitti?

637
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,230
Oh, my God.

638
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:23,500
Listen. It's not Iike he's a regular patient.

639
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:24,970
He's got problems.

640
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:28,540
He thinks that I'm treating him. It's crazy.

641
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:30,240
So you're not treating him?

642
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,740
Tell me you're not.

643
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:33,140
I'm not treating him.

644
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:36,380
It's scary. You don't want someone Iike that in your Iife.

645
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:39,450
I've covered the mob down here. I've seen what they do.

646
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:42,780
He and I spoke about it. He understood. It's over.

647
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:45,120
-You're sure? -Absolutely.

648
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:49,030
I was so worried.

649
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:51,330
I thought maybe you got scared or...

650
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:53,500
...saw an ex-girlfriend or something.

651
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,500
Well, I don't know.

652
00:34:56,410 --> 00:34:57,930
-I Iove you. -I Iove you.

653
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:01,340
I'm sorry, but everything's going to be okay.

654
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:06,640
Give her a big hand! Let's hear it!

655
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:08,250
How about that?

656
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,580
That was great! Come on, get into it.

657
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,280
I don't understand. They splash in the water.

658
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:19,620
They eat fish.

659
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,520
This is not a big stretch for a whale.

660
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:22,720
Stop it.

661
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:24,700
We're having fun, right?

662
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,140
I'm not having as much fun as it Iooks Iike I am.

663
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:31,140
I'm pretending, because we have to bond and all.

664
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:40,140
As I was saying. a little snack for her might be 50 pounds of mackerel.

665
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,050
There she goes!

666
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:50,550
I' m going to get a hot dog. Anybody want anything?

667
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,280
-I'II go with you. -It's fine.

668
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,330
You' re pretending to have a good time. I don't want to spoil that.

669
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,790
I'II be right back.

670
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,090
You think those whales piss in that water?

671
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:03,360
I think they use the men's room next door to the Burger IKing.

672
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:04,500
Dummy.

673
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:06,870
-What's going on? -Mr. Vitti wants to see you.

674
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,130
Is this a joke?

675
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,710
You're an employee of Mr Vitti's...

676
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:12,310
...which means you're on call 24 hours a day...

677
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,010
...just Iike the rest of us.

678
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:15,580
I'm sorry. He and I discussed...

679
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:18,980
We discussed this, and I agreed to see him in New York.

680
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:20,090
That's it.

681
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:23,220
Dr. Momma-Luke, Iisten to me. It is what it is.

682
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:25,920
If he wants you sooner, you go sooner.

683
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:27,390
That's it.

684
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,860
No. I am not going.

685
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:31,630
And if either one of you bother me again...

686
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:33,270
...I won't treat him at all.

687
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:35,400
Do you understand that? Capisci?

688
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,970
It's over! End of story.

689
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:41,540
Look at the size of this one.

690
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,940
Jesus Christ!

691
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,210
It's feeding time.

692
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,610
They threw me in the shark tank, Paul.

693
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,080
They were trying to make a point.

694
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:55,450
That you're scary? Believe me, I get it.

695
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:56,560
You're in a mood.

696
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,320
I get that way when a shark tries to chew on my ass.

697
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:02,220
-We had an agreement. -We did, but I had an episode.

698
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:05,420
I didn't have a panic attack, but I started panicking...

699
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,660
...thinking I might get one. Is that weird?

700
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:10,600
I am redefining "weird" on an hourly basis.

701
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:12,570
-What's he doing? -I don't know.

702
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:15,210
-He's talking with some guy. -Can you hit him?

703
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:18,540
He's got fat Jelly and his partner Jimmy Boots with him.

704
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:21,770
I could do it with a rifle, but I don't have that with me.

705
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,010
Just get him.

706
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,310
You told me to take care of him, I'II do it.

707
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,650
What were you thinking when you got anxious?

708
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:30,190
Let's get out of here. We're being watched.

709
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:33,160
Don't Iook. There's feds up there watching us.

710
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,020
How do you know that?

711
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:36,960
I'm a criminal. It's my job.

712
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:39,260
Who's the new face?

713
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:43,440
Maybe he's Vitti's new consigliere.

714
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:46,730
Whoever this guy is, he must be important to the family.

715
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:49,670
Put his picture on the wire, see what you come up with.

716
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:58,180
Normally, a patient wouldn't have a vat of scotch during a session.

717
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,850
That's interesting. I'II have to remember it if I'm ever on Jeopardy.

718
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,430
Tell me about your father.

719
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:08,260
My father. Well, my father....

720
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,950
Let's sit here.

721
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:11,990
My father.

722
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:15,800
A big man in the neighborhood. Everybody Ioved him.

723
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:17,940
Very well-respected, God rest his soul.

724
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:19,630
He passed away?

725
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,810
I just Iike saying "God rest his soul. " Of course he passed away!

726
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,710
I was about 1 2 at the time.

727
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:26,210
How did he die?

728
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,880
It was a sudden thing. A heart attack.

729
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:31,490
How was the relationship? Were you close?

730
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:32,980
We were pretty close.

731
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:35,380
We weren't getting along great right then.

732
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:36,820
Why is that?

733
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:40,330
I was hanging out in the neighborhood. I had a borgata.

734
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:41,360
What is that?

735
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,060
A kid gang, nothing big. But he didn't Iike that.

736
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:45,320
He didn't approve.

737
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:48,000
He slapped me around a couple of times.

738
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,500
And what?

739
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:51,000
And then he died.

740
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:53,410
How'd that make you feel?

741
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:56,080
It felt great, wonderful. How'd it make me feel?

742
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,340
Think about it.

743
00:38:57,550 --> 00:39:00,740
Were you angry? Were you afraid? Sad?

744
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:02,920
Maybe all those things.

745
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,310
Any feelings of guilt?

746
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:06,310
About what? I didn't kill him.

747
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,150
I know that, I'm just speculating...

748
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,360
...that maybe in some way you may have wanted him to die.

749
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,030
Why would I want him to die?

750
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:17,170
You said you were fighting. He slapped you around...

751
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:19,560
...because you rebelled against his authority.

752
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:21,600
Maybe some unresolved Oedipal conflict.

753
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,470
English, English.

754
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:27,510
Oedipus was a Greek king who killed his father and married his mother.

755
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:28,770
Fucking Greeks.

756
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:31,310
It's an instinctual developmental drive.

757
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:33,610
The young boy wants to replace his father...

758
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:36,310
...so that he can totally possess his mother.

759
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:38,710
Are you saying I wanted to fuck my mother?

760
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,950
It's a primal fantasy.

761
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,020
Have you ever seen my mother?

762
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:44,350
-Are you out of your mind? -It's Freud!

763
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,460
Freud's a sick fuck, and you are too for bringing it up.

764
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:54,530
Can I be honest? I don't think I can call you Dad.

765
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:57,470
So what do I call you? Do I call you Scott?

766
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:59,370
My friends call me Captain.

767
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,570
Captain?

768
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:05,740
Want another drink? I' m definitely having 8 or 9.

769
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:07,280
I'd Iike a morphine and soda.

770
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,740
I' m shaking.

771
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:13,780
Shall we go to our table? Come on, Michael.

772
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,890
Senor Sobol.

773
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:21,520
How you doing?

774
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,150
It's the Vittis.

775
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:25,890
My God.

776
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,230
Everybody's happy, everybody's smiling. This is nice.

777
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:33,340
You Paul Vitti, the mobster.

778
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:36,640
Now, is that polite?

779
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:39,750
Is that being nice? I'm trying to be nice.

780
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:42,920
Do I walk up to you and say you're so-and-so, the hard-on?

781
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:46,080
This is Laura's father, the captain.

782
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:48,090
I'm very, very sorry.

783
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:49,420
Excuse us.

784
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:53,950
I heard about the wedding. Here you go.

785
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,460
A Iittle something for the bride and groom. God bless.

786
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:58,930
We can't accept this.

787
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:00,660
-Yes, you can. -Thank you.

788
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:04,430
I'm just going to borrow this guy. I'II bring him right back.

789
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,340
And then you'II Ieave us alone.

790
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:08,040
I'II Ieave you alone.

791
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,470
I got to talk to you.

792
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:12,970
Two minutes. Two minutes.

793
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:15,780
Wait over there. Don't Iisten to what we say.

794
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:17,450
My ears are sealed.

795
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:19,550
I had a really weird dream Iast night.

796
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,750
I feel Iike I'm having one now. Why'd you interrupt my party?

797
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,480
You're really very rigid about certain things.

798
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:27,030
Did you know that?

799
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:29,560
AII right, tell me about your dream.

800
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:31,360
I'm asleep.

801
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,190
I hear a baby crying. I go to the refrigerator.

802
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,990
I get him a bottle of milk.

803
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:38,000
I bring the bottle of milk to him...

804
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:39,540
...I see the milk is black.

805
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,330
That's fucking weird!

806
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,370
Get out of here.

807
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:44,270
-Get out of here. -Sorry.

808
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:48,410
What does that mean? And no more filth about my mother.

809
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:50,550
I don't know. What does it mean to you?

810
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:54,620
This is why I pay you? I say something, you say it back to me?

811
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:57,050
I could get Jelly to do that for nothing.

812
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:59,820
Get Jelly. I'm going back to my party.

813
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,920
AII right. I'm Ietting it go this time.

814
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:07,230
Because you're getting married, I'm going to Iet it go.

815
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:14,970
Why don't you Iook over that way before I bust your fucking head open?

816
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:32,120
I'm going to grab a bite to eat. You want a sandwich?

817
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:34,790
What kind of sandwich ain't too fattening?

818
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,590
A half a sandwich.

819
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:39,070
I'II be back in a few minutes.

820
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:12,530
Now, nod your head and smile. Do it.

821
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:15,160
Now, you Iisten to me, goombah.

822
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:18,270
I know what your game is, and you'd better call it quits.

823
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:22,200
If you and your paisans do anything to hurt my Iittle girl...

824
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:24,000
...I don't care who your friends are...

825
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:27,550
...I'II hunt you down Iike the dog you are, and I'II kill you.

826
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,150
Understand?

827
00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:31,250
Now, nod and smile.

828
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:33,050
Congratulations.

829
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:37,890
What was that about?

830
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:41,060
Just guy stuff between me and the captain.

831
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:47,880
Shit!

832
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,760
In sickness and in health, from this day forth...

833
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:56,130
...as Iong as you both shall Iive?

834
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:07,840
Bring Marie and the kids right to the airport.

835
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:11,820
Pull the car in the back of the hotel and wait for us.

836
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:13,040
You got it, boss.

837
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:15,880
That's it. That is it. I have had it with you.

838
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:17,150
-What happened? -What happened?

839
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:21,230
I just saw a man fall seven stories into a platter of poached salmon!

840
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:23,300
-Did he break anything? -Everything!

841
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,190
They' re still pulling capers out of him.

842
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:29,240
People get depressed, they jump. It's a tragedy, but it ain't my fault.

843
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,070
You're telling me it was a suicide?

844
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:33,800
I think he Ieft a note. Jelly, did they find it?

845
00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:35,940
No, but they will in a minute.

846
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,270
Let me guess what it says: "Life is bullshit.

847
00:45:38,510 --> 00:45:40,810
I can't fucking take it no more. Signed, the dead guy."

848
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:42,950
That's good, Doc.

849
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:45,420
Enough talk. We got to get out of here.

850
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:47,210
There's feds all over.

851
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:49,290
I'm going back to New York...

852
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:52,290
...and I would suggest that you do the same thing.

853
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:54,290
Because they're probably onto you too.

854
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:56,560
Onto me? What are you talking about?

855
00:45:56,770 --> 00:46:00,220
Being an accessory to a murder wasn't part of our understanding.

856
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:02,060
I didn't kill nobody.

857
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:04,170
I can't speak for other people in the room.

858
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:05,400
That guy tried to kill me.

859
00:46:05,610 --> 00:46:08,340
God forbid he did that to somebody in my family.

860
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:10,840
It would've been a double or a triple tragedy.

861
00:46:11,050 --> 00:46:13,410
Trust me, in this case, we're the good guys.

862
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:14,740
Where is he?

863
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:18,150
-Where are you going? -Don't touch me.

864
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:20,720
How could you do that?

865
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:22,790
Another country heard from.

866
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:24,350
Wait downstairs.

867
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:27,760
Why? Are they going to throw me off the balcony too?

868
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:30,890
You' re upset and you' re upsetting me.

869
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:32,160
Of course I' m upset!

870
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,700
My wedding is ruined because you've got problems!

871
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:36,960
I got problems?

872
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:38,570
Honey, please.

873
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:42,410
I'm going to pack, and then I'm going to New York.

874
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:45,580
And I am getting married with you or without you!

875
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:48,340
With! With! I'm sorry, honey.

876
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:50,380
It'II all work out. I promise.

877
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:51,920
PIease?

878
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:54,480
No, I hate you!

879
00:46:56,090 --> 00:46:58,150
Are you happy? Are you happy?

880
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,660
You know what you did? You have ruined my Iife!

881
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,760
Happy? What are you talking about?

882
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:05,230
You think I wanted this? I'm a victim here.

883
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:06,870
I can't believe this guy.

884
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:09,330
He tries to kill me, then whacks one of my guys.

885
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:13,070
On top of that, he fucks up your wedding. You know how upset I am?

886
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,010
I'm so enraged, I don't know what do to with myself!

887
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:18,740
PIus, I'm trying to get out of this hotel and...

888
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:20,610
Are you Iistening to yourself?

889
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:21,980
Listen to yourself!

890
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:26,380
This has been a disaster from the moment you stepped foot in my office.

891
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:29,220
That is it. Over! I' m no Ionger your doctor.

892
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:30,650
Just because of this?

893
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:34,230
Because of this Iittle double homicide? Yes, because of this!

894
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:37,960
You don't have a shred of human decency. Not a shred.

895
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:40,130
I actually thought I could help you.

896
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:42,860
There's no helping you. You're a common thug!

897
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:44,700
Nobody in the world could help you!

898
00:47:44,910 --> 00:47:46,530
AII right! What do you want me to do?

899
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:53,210
Let me speak to Primo.

900
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:54,310
Hold on.

901
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:58,410
Paul Vitti's on the phone.

902
00:48:08,930 --> 00:48:10,230
-Who is this? -It's me.

903
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:12,560
-Me who? -Me who... Me, me.

904
00:48:12,770 --> 00:48:15,430
-Me. me who? -Me, me. You know me. Me.

905
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:17,400
Yeah, how's it going?

906
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:18,800
Not good. Not good.

907
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:21,980
Whoever did that thing to you-know-who, my good friend...

908
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:23,640
...they're trying to do that to me.

909
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:26,280
And I'm having a lot of feelings about that.

910
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:29,010
And I' m trying to get some...

911
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:31,340
-CIosure. -closure on that.

912
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:34,960
What kind of feelings?

913
00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:38,060
I' m very angry. I' m feeling very angry about that.

914
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:40,920
I'm enraged.

915
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:43,360
I'm feeling very, very mad about that.

916
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:44,860
Why are you telling me?

917
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:46,470
Why am I telling you?

918
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:48,830
Like you don't know nothing about it?

919
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,370
You don't know nothing? What?

920
00:48:50,810 --> 00:48:52,670
I don't know what you're talking about.

921
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:54,500
-I'm trying to.... -Tell you how I feel.

922
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:57,240
Tell you about my feelings and that....

923
00:48:57,610 --> 00:48:58,980
-I'm angry. -I'm angry.

924
00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:00,580
And anger is a....

925
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:02,550
-A blocked wish. -A blocked wish.

926
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:06,020
And I'm looking forward to seeing you next week at that thing...

927
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:08,820
...then I can unblock that angered wish...

928
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:09,990
...and then hopefully....

929
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:12,690
You make one more move on me, you motherfucker...

930
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:14,890
...I'II fucking cut your fucking balls off!

931
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:18,460
I'II shove them up your fucking ass, I'II fucking bury you!

932
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:21,690
I'II put ice picks in your eyes! I'II chop your eyeballs!

933
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:24,700
I'II send them to your family to eat for dessert!

934
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:26,240
You understand me?

935
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:28,410
-What? -Fuck you.

936
00:49:28,610 --> 00:49:30,410
You motherfucker!

937
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:36,210
You get a dictionary and find out what this "closure" is.

938
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:40,580
If that's what he's going to hit us with, I want to know what it is.

939
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:42,190
How was that?

940
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:44,490
It was going great until...

941
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:47,460
...the cutting off of the balls and shoving it up...

942
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:48,930
...his ass.

943
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:52,390
You know what I do when I'm mad? I hit a pillow.

944
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:54,330
Just hit the pillow. See how you feel.

945
00:49:59,310 --> 00:50:01,140
There's your fucking pillow.

946
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:03,440
Feel better?

947
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,510
Yeah, I do.

948
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,010
Good.

949
00:50:22,730 --> 00:50:25,460
Call the Vatican. See if something is missing.

950
00:50:25,830 --> 00:50:27,200
So cool!

951
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:31,900
I need to talk to your dad in private, okay?

952
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:33,900
Would you unload the car, please?

953
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:36,910
It's almost as tall as the house.

954
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:41,810
What is going on?

955
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:43,650
What is this?

956
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:45,920
Why?

957
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:49,150
It's a wedding gift. He felt bad for the...

958
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:53,350
Well, we're not married, so we can just send it back.

959
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,120
It was not my fault. Everybody was there.

960
00:50:58,330 --> 00:51:01,100
You didn't want to go ahead with the ceremony.

961
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:05,260
What did you expect? That's not what I want for an anniversary memory.

962
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:08,870
Look at our wedding video. There are your parents, and mine.

963
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:11,340
There's the guy that plunged to his death.

964
00:51:11,550 --> 00:51:13,740
I just want to marry you.

965
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:16,180
I'm thinking it'II never happen.

966
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:19,250
It's happening next Saturday at the Waldorf.

967
00:51:19,450 --> 00:51:20,680
And who will be there?

968
00:51:20,890 --> 00:51:22,250
The three of us, the clergyman...

969
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:25,950
...and any of your family who are done with their crisis counseling.

970
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,720
No guests without necks. Everybody has to have a neck.

971
00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:31,130
We will do a neck check at the door.

972
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:36,140
Any furniture you want to change in the house...

973
00:51:37,370 --> 00:51:38,740
Dr. Sobol.

974
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:39,840
Ma'am.

975
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,770
I'm Agent Steadman. Agent Ricci, Agent Provano...

976
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:44,910
...Federal Bureau of Investigation, OCD.

977
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:46,980
Obsessive-compulsive disorder?

978
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:50,150
Organized Crime Division. We need to talk.

979
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:52,680
FBI? This is cooler than the fountain.

980
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:53,980
Go to your room.

981
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:56,020
-But I just... -Go to your room.

982
00:51:56,390 --> 00:51:58,880
Fine. I can hear better in there anyway.

983
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,220
PIease.

984
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,730
Can you explain these photographs?

985
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:19,070
Yes. I'm a psychotherapist. Paul Vitti is my patient.

986
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,940
-Was your patient. -Was my patient.

987
00:52:21,150 --> 00:52:23,080
But not even Iike a patient.

988
00:52:23,290 --> 00:52:24,340
Right. Exactly.

989
00:52:24,590 --> 00:52:26,680
So why did he send you that fountain?

990
00:52:27,990 --> 00:52:29,420
The fountain?

991
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:32,320
That was a....

992
00:52:33,090 --> 00:52:36,500
That was a gift to celebrate the completion...

993
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:38,030
...of the therapy.

994
00:52:38,270 --> 00:52:40,460
I got a television from a kleptomaniac...

995
00:52:40,670 --> 00:52:43,040
...so it's not really that big of a deal.

996
00:52:43,270 --> 00:52:45,540
Let me cut to the chase, Dr. Sobol.

997
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:50,410
Sometime in the next week, the heads of every major crime family...

998
00:52:50,610 --> 00:52:52,740
...are meeting somewhere in the New York area.

999
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:55,780
We think the stage is set for a major bloodbath.

1000
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:57,280
Has he mentioned it to you?

1001
00:52:57,490 --> 00:52:58,850
A bloodbath?

1002
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,120
He has not mentioned anything Iike that.

1003
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:05,450
I would've remembered that.

1004
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:08,690
" BIoodbath " is something that sticks out in a conversation.

1005
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:12,860
You could really help us by supplying information about that meeting.

1006
00:53:13,970 --> 00:53:15,700
If I don't?

1007
00:53:15,970 --> 00:53:16,960
If you don't...

1008
00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:20,740
...I will personally make your Iife a Iiving hell.

1009
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:27,740
Pauly. I don't mean this in a disrespectful way.

1010
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:31,350
Now, you know I was a good friend to your father.

1011
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:33,820
I'II always be a good friend to you.

1012
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:38,260
But the word is out that you' re talking to a shrink.

1013
00:53:38,490 --> 00:53:39,390
Is that right?

1014
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:40,620
What's the point here?

1015
00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:44,060
The point is this concerns the whole family.

1016
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,830
Right now, we're the only ones that know about it.

1017
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:50,900
If this ever gets out in the street, we're dead.

1018
00:53:51,110 --> 00:53:53,010
Who knows what you're saying to him?

1019
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:55,730
It ain't nobody's fucking business.

1020
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:57,210
I beg to differ.

1021
00:53:57,410 --> 00:54:01,310
If you're Iooking to establish an insanity plea for Iater on...

1022
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:02,810
...that's okay.

1023
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:06,520
But everybody'II think you're falling apart. It's not right.

1024
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,160
They'II think this is a sign of weakness.

1025
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:12,290
Sindone will take over everything. Is that what you want?

1026
00:54:12,490 --> 00:54:14,120
So what do you want me to do?

1027
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,250
It's time to end it, Paul.

1028
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:17,800
What do you mean, end it?

1029
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:20,330
Get rid of the shrink. He knows too much.

1030
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:22,870
You want me to whack my doctor? Are you crazy?

1031
00:54:23,870 --> 00:54:26,930
Paul, if you don't do it, somebody else will.

1032
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:28,700
That's the way it is.

1033
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:30,730
Nobody touches this guy.

1034
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:34,350
Anybody Iays a finger on him, I'II kill them. Understood?

1035
00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:42,180
-I'm getting fruit. Want anything? -No, I'II wait in the car.

1036
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:50,960
Can I get two of these?

1037
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:26,730
Papa!

1038
00:55:30,270 --> 00:55:32,140
Papa! Papa!

1039
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:49,420
I'm sorry.

1040
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:50,750
Sorry.

1041
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:01,700
You Iook Iousy. You all right?

1042
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:06,030
Yeah, I'm all right. Listen, Paul, don't send me any more gifts.

1043
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:10,640
-You didn't Iike the fountain? -It's a boundary issue.

1044
00:56:10,850 --> 00:56:13,710
If more people gave from the heart, we'd all be better off.

1045
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:17,320
Let me see your watch. Piece of junk. You're getting a Rolex.

1046
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:20,180
-Don't buy me one. -Who said anything about buying?

1047
00:56:20,390 --> 00:56:22,720
Paul, Iisten. I really have to talk to you.

1048
00:56:32,570 --> 00:56:33,560
Who is that?

1049
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:39,070
Tommy Angels. We grew up together. Worked for a crew out of Jersey City.

1050
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:40,870
How did he die?

1051
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:46,340
He was on his way to talk to a federal prosecutor.

1052
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:48,410
Got hit by a truck.

1053
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:50,280
Twice.

1054
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:52,210
I don't need to know this.

1055
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:53,680
I can't hear this.

1056
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:57,860
This is too much for me. I'm having nightmares myself.

1057
00:56:57,990 --> 00:57:01,120
The other night, I dreamed you and I were walking down the street...

1058
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:02,820
...and I stopped to buy some fruit.

1059
00:57:03,030 --> 00:57:05,590
Out of nowhere, two guys come and they kill me...

1060
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:09,000
...Iike Marlon Brando in The Godfather.

1061
00:57:10,110 --> 00:57:12,510
Good scene. What'd I do?

1062
00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:13,870
You drop your gun.

1063
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:17,570
You run up to me and you yell, "Papa! Papa!"

1064
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:19,340
I was Fredo?

1065
00:57:19,850 --> 00:57:21,410
I don't think so.

1066
00:57:22,950 --> 00:57:25,750
You're starting to Iose it. You may need therapy yourself.

1067
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:28,010
Paul, we really have to talk.

1068
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:32,560
We're running out of time.

1069
00:57:51,150 --> 00:57:52,310
The widow.

1070
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:54,150
I'm very sorry.

1071
00:57:55,450 --> 00:57:56,540
The daughter.

1072
00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:57,980
I'm sorry.

1073
00:58:00,990 --> 00:58:01,820
Brother.

1074
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:03,950
My condolences.

1075
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:11,430
I'm very sorry.

1076
00:58:29,350 --> 00:58:30,840
Him I don't know.

1077
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:37,820
Can we talk now?

1078
00:58:42,630 --> 00:58:46,090
Don't you see? You called me Papa. This is all about your father.

1079
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:47,830
You're nuts. That's your dream.

1080
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:50,500
But the black milk dream is also about your father.

1081
00:58:50,710 --> 00:58:53,700
I don't buy that. In my dream, I'm bringing the baby the black milk.

1082
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:56,340
Freud believed you're everyone in your dreams.

1083
00:58:56,540 --> 00:58:58,480
Fuck Freud. After what you told me...

1084
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:01,210
...I'm afraid to call my mother on the telephone.

1085
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:03,640
Listen, just try to go with me here.

1086
00:59:03,850 --> 00:59:05,980
Let's just say that you are the baby.

1087
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:08,090
What kind of milk did your father bring you?

1088
00:59:08,290 --> 00:59:10,190
Could we stop talking about my father?

1089
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:13,520
That's the point. We have to talk about your father.

1090
00:59:13,730 --> 00:59:16,030
It is so hard to... You know what you're Iike?

1091
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:18,200
Like this: "Doc, you got to help me.

1092
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,960
I'm in pain. PIease help me."

1093
00:59:20,170 --> 00:59:22,970
"AII right, Paul, I'II help." "Fuck you. Nobody helps Paul Vitti."

1094
00:59:23,170 --> 00:59:25,230
AII right, very good. This is you:

1095
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:27,740
"That's interesting. What does that mean to you?

1096
00:59:28,410 --> 00:59:29,670
Anger is a blocked wish."

1097
00:59:29,910 --> 00:59:31,900
Boo-fucking-hoo-hoo.

1098
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:34,210
-Let's talk about your father. -Let's not.

1099
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:35,640
What does your father do?

1100
00:59:35,850 --> 00:59:36,940
It's not important.

1101
00:59:37,150 --> 00:59:39,240
-What? You paused. -I did not.

1102
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:42,480
You just paused. That means you had a feeling. A thought.

1103
00:59:42,690 --> 00:59:44,660
What does your father do? What's he do?

1104
00:59:45,030 --> 00:59:47,260
-He's a psychiatrist. -A psychiatrist?

1105
00:59:49,330 --> 00:59:51,990
Now I know why you're fucked up. Next patient, please.

1106
00:59:52,370 --> 00:59:53,660
We are running out of time.

1107
00:59:53,870 --> 00:59:56,560
-Let's not waste it on my problems. -Your father's a problem?

1108
00:59:57,270 --> 00:59:58,360
-That's what you said. -I did not!

1109
00:59:58,610 --> 00:59:59,600
Now you're upset.

1110
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:00,770
I am not upset!

1111
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:02,100
-Yes, you are. -Stop it!

1112
01:00:02,310 --> 01:00:03,500
I'm getting good at this!

1113
01:00:04,610 --> 01:00:07,880
We only have a few days Ieft. This is very important stuff.

1114
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:10,050
That's why you're acting Iike this.

1115
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:12,310
If you want to spend it screwing around, I can't help you.

1116
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:14,280
Call me when you want to get serious.

1117
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:16,480
I am serious.

1118
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:18,960
Don't you want to analyze me no more?

1119
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:22,890
Say hello to your father for me.

1120
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:30,800
It's time to end it. Paul.

1121
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:32,110
What do you mean. end it?

1122
01:00:32,310 --> 01:00:34,870
Get rid of the shrink. He knows too much already.

1123
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:36,940
You want me to whack my doctor?

1124
01:00:37,150 --> 01:00:39,980
If you don't do it. somebody else will.

1125
01:00:41,150 --> 01:00:42,450
Nobody touches this guy.

1126
01:00:42,650 --> 01:00:45,050
Anybody lays a finger on him. I'll kill them.

1127
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:46,650
Understood?

1128
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:49,650
Now Iet's hear the other one.

1129
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:51,850
You want me to whack my doctor?

1130
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:54,890
If you don't do it. somebody else will.

1131
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:57,190
I'm going to kill them.

1132
01:00:59,570 --> 01:01:01,330
-Good. -That's very good.

1133
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:04,200
We think it's time to end it.

1134
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:05,460
What do you mean?

1135
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:08,540
Get rid of the shrink. He knows too much already.

1136
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:09,970
You want me to whack my doctor?

1137
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:13,010
If you don't do it. somebody else will.

1138
01:01:13,950 --> 01:01:15,470
I'm going to kill them.

1139
01:01:20,020 --> 01:01:21,550
What do you want me to do?

1140
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:26,990
Paul. he's talking to the feds.

1141
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,930
I know this guy. He wouldn't talk to the feds. No way.

1142
01:01:30,130 --> 01:01:33,930
The FBI was over at his house today. Jimmy Boots saw them.

1143
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,800
-You saw them there? -It's the truth. I saw them.

1144
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:38,530
Next, you'II get a call...

1145
01:01:38,810 --> 01:01:40,470
...and he'II want a meeting.

1146
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,410
Dr. Sobol called.

1147
01:01:44,610 --> 01:01:47,080
He said he needs to see you right away.

1148
01:01:57,060 --> 01:01:58,550
This is delicious.

1149
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:00,230
This is so good.

1150
01:02:00,630 --> 01:02:02,150
I Iove Italian food.

1151
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,390
I've never been to Italy. Is it great?

1152
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:06,490
I was in France twice...

1153
01:02:06,730 --> 01:02:08,530
...and Jamaica, the island.

1154
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:09,700
You ever been there?

1155
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:11,800
It's great, because I Iove to snorkel.

1156
01:02:12,010 --> 01:02:15,070
Have you guys ever snorkeled? It's great to sleep with the fish.

1157
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,340
Swim with the fish. Have you ever done that?

1158
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:19,570
It's good. So...

1159
01:02:19,780 --> 01:02:21,410
...what are you doing this summer?

1160
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:23,620
About what?

1161
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,250
How are you?

1162
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:30,990
-How you doing? -Good.

1163
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:33,790
This is Ben. Say hello to Carlo.

1164
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:36,060
-How you doing? -Carlo...?

1165
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:38,460
That's it. Grab a seat.

1166
01:02:41,670 --> 01:02:43,530
Carlo and I grew up together.

1167
01:02:43,770 --> 01:02:45,740
He's Iike, I would say, almost...

1168
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:47,840
...Iike a cousin to me.

1169
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:50,410
-I am your cousin. -That's what I'm saying.

1170
01:02:50,610 --> 01:02:52,670
It's a family thing. It's the closeness.

1171
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:55,910
Anything he needs, anything I can do for him, I'm here for him.

1172
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:57,450
-You know that. -I know.

1173
01:02:57,650 --> 01:02:59,380
Did you take care of that thing?

1174
01:02:59,790 --> 01:03:03,220
-It's all right to talk business? -It's okay.

1175
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,120
-I took care of it. -And the other?

1176
01:03:05,330 --> 01:03:08,450
I got to wait for the first before I can move on the second.

1177
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:10,290
The guy give you a problem?

1178
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:13,370
The guy in the first thing? He's a Iunatic.

1179
01:03:13,570 --> 01:03:15,200
-What did he say? -The usual.

1180
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:18,200
-You told him you weren't doing it? -What am I going to do?

1181
01:03:18,410 --> 01:03:20,310
Got to nip that shit in the bud.

1182
01:03:20,510 --> 01:03:23,100
But if the first comes through. that'll fix everything.

1183
01:03:23,310 --> 01:03:26,180
Including the second thing. Exactly.

1184
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:29,550
Don't repeat what you hear here. You hear?

1185
01:03:30,150 --> 01:03:31,980
The first thing or the second thing?

1186
01:03:32,190 --> 01:03:33,210
Very funny.

1187
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:35,320
Stevie Beef is over there.

1188
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:38,920
-Fat piece of shit. -Rat-fucking, cocksucking....

1189
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:41,650
-Scumbag. -Garbage pail.

1190
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:43,090
Let's go say hi.

1191
01:03:48,370 --> 01:03:52,570
So this is a very unusual place. Do you guys come here often?

1192
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:56,570
Well, this place has a very special meaning for Paul.

1193
01:03:56,780 --> 01:03:59,250
Yeah, it's where his father got whacked.

1194
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:02,040
What's the big secret?

1195
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:03,340
Never mind.

1196
01:04:03,550 --> 01:04:05,040
Wait a second.

1197
01:04:07,050 --> 01:04:08,580
Paul's father was murdered?

1198
01:04:08,790 --> 01:04:11,260
Right at that table, with his whole family there.

1199
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:13,430
Shut your face.

1200
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:18,700
Paul was there too.

1201
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:22,200
He doesn't Iike to talk about it.

1202
01:04:29,310 --> 01:04:30,540
Where you going?

1203
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:31,870
To the bathroom.

1204
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:33,580
Sit down.

1205
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:35,370
I'm going with you.

1206
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:45,090
Jelly, I have to, you know....

1207
01:04:45,430 --> 01:04:46,550
Poop?

1208
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:49,660
Go ahead.

1209
01:05:11,590 --> 01:05:13,350
Holy shit!

1210
01:05:17,290 --> 01:05:19,490
You got to get more roughage, Doc.

1211
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:23,330
A bran muffin in the morning would help that.

1212
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:27,260
I don't believe this.

1213
01:05:27,470 --> 01:05:29,830
I'd Iike to see a movie, but there's nothing out there.

1214
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:33,230
It's all this shoot-them-up action bullshit.

1215
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,430
I get enough of that at work.

1216
01:05:36,510 --> 01:05:39,100
Primo, that was our friend.

1217
01:05:39,450 --> 01:05:41,510
They spotted that guy at Paretti's Restaurant.

1218
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:43,240
That's good.

1219
01:05:43,450 --> 01:05:44,980
That's very good.

1220
01:05:45,220 --> 01:05:46,810
Handsome Jack.

1221
01:05:47,690 --> 01:05:49,550
Let's make it his Iast supper.

1222
01:05:49,890 --> 01:05:52,120
-You got it, Primo. -No problem.

1223
01:05:53,630 --> 01:05:55,150
Just for fun...

1224
01:05:55,630 --> 01:05:57,720
...tear out his heart and bring it to me.

1225
01:05:57,970 --> 01:06:00,960
I'm going to bring it back to you on a fucking platter.

1226
01:06:01,170 --> 01:06:02,730
Where we going to get a platter?

1227
01:06:02,970 --> 01:06:04,460
Just bring it, all right?

1228
01:06:05,310 --> 01:06:07,470
Or Raisin Bran. That goes right through me.

1229
01:06:07,710 --> 01:06:09,570
-It's a pusher. -Good tip.

1230
01:06:09,810 --> 01:06:12,680
I have to talk to you. In private.

1231
01:06:17,990 --> 01:06:19,820
Why didn't you tell me about your father?

1232
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:20,890
What about him?

1233
01:06:21,090 --> 01:06:23,060
You told me he died of a heart attack.

1234
01:06:23,260 --> 01:06:24,380
What's the problem?

1235
01:06:24,590 --> 01:06:26,420
Your father was murdered.

1236
01:06:26,990 --> 01:06:29,260
What's the difference? He's dead.

1237
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:32,430
It's a big difference. Why didn't you tell me?

1238
01:06:32,670 --> 01:06:35,260
It's private. I got to tell you every Iittle thing?

1239
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:36,970
This is not a Iittle thing.

1240
01:06:37,170 --> 01:06:39,400
What am I going to do? Spend my Iife crying about the past?

1241
01:06:39,610 --> 01:06:40,900
It's over. Forget it.

1242
01:06:41,110 --> 01:06:43,100
I think you want to talk about it.

1243
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:45,210
-I don't want to talk about it. -You do.

1244
01:06:45,410 --> 01:06:47,110
I don't want to talk about it.

1245
01:06:47,350 --> 01:06:49,680
-Why did you choose this restaurant? -I Iike it.

1246
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:51,940
Of all the places we could've gone, why this place?

1247
01:06:52,190 --> 01:06:53,150
White clam sauce. The best.

1248
01:06:53,350 --> 01:06:56,920
That's not the reason. You want me to know about your father.

1249
01:06:57,120 --> 01:07:00,090
-You're reaching out to me. -Yeah, I'm reaching out to you.

1250
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:01,590
Where is it?

1251
01:07:11,610 --> 01:07:12,440
Get in the car.

1252
01:07:15,140 --> 01:07:18,440
It's Iate. I'II take a cab. I can get to Grand Central and....

1253
01:07:18,650 --> 01:07:20,550
You know what? I can make the 1 1 : 1 0.

1254
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:22,110
So thanks, anyway.

1255
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:24,480
I said get in the car, Doc.

1256
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:27,280
Do what he says.

1257
01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:32,550
You know, this is called a "transference neurosis," where the patient...

1258
01:07:36,130 --> 01:07:37,560
Get in the car.

1259
01:08:02,790 --> 01:08:06,420
What is this guy doing? He's been in the bathroom for half an hour.

1260
01:08:06,990 --> 01:08:08,050
Fuck!

1261
01:08:08,260 --> 01:08:09,250
Get over there!

1262
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:19,500
Son of a bitch!

1263
01:08:21,610 --> 01:08:22,770
We Iost him.

1264
01:08:51,670 --> 01:08:53,140
Come on, get out.

1265
01:08:53,340 --> 01:08:54,900
Get out and get over there.

1266
01:08:59,310 --> 01:09:00,870
AII right, Ieave us alone.

1267
01:09:02,650 --> 01:09:03,910
Sorry, Doc.

1268
01:09:04,190 --> 01:09:05,350
It's not personal.

1269
01:09:05,550 --> 01:09:08,720
Don't kid yourself. It doesn't get more personal than this.

1270
01:09:10,990 --> 01:09:12,480
Walk over there.

1271
01:09:12,830 --> 01:09:14,320
Walk over there.

1272
01:09:20,170 --> 01:09:22,430
-You know why I got to do this? -Yes. Do you?

1273
01:09:22,670 --> 01:09:25,540
Don't bullshit me. You ratted me out, you betrayed me.

1274
01:09:25,740 --> 01:09:28,670
I betrayed you? That's interesting. Who's got the gun?

1275
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:31,500
Don't give me that. Are you insulting my intelligence?

1276
01:09:31,710 --> 01:09:33,240
You cooperated with the feds.

1277
01:09:33,450 --> 01:09:36,680
They played me a tape. I heard you say you were going to kill me.

1278
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:39,280
-I heard the tape. -Never. On my mother's Iife.

1279
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:40,580
-Never. -I heard it.

1280
01:09:40,790 --> 01:09:43,280
It's not important now, but I did not betray you.

1281
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:46,220
I had a wire on, but I took it off because I think I can help you.

1282
01:09:46,430 --> 01:09:48,420
I don't want to know what you think.

1283
01:09:48,630 --> 01:09:49,490
Yes, you do.

1284
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:51,130
Let me help you!

1285
01:09:51,370 --> 01:09:52,590
It's over!

1286
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,600
Can I ask you one Iast question?

1287
01:10:00,540 --> 01:10:01,470
What?

1288
01:10:01,710 --> 01:10:03,040
-What did you order? -What?

1289
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:04,870
-What did you order? -When?

1290
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:07,840
The night your father was killed, what were you eating?

1291
01:10:08,050 --> 01:10:09,950
How the fuck do I know?

1292
01:10:10,420 --> 01:10:11,480
You don't remember?

1293
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:13,020
It was 35 years ago.

1294
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:14,550
What was your father eating?

1295
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:17,050
I don't remember. What are you talking about?

1296
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:18,310
Try.

1297
01:10:18,930 --> 01:10:22,520
It's a simple question. What was your father eating?

1298
01:10:32,670 --> 01:10:33,610
Penne.

1299
01:10:35,210 --> 01:10:36,040
Good.

1300
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:37,680
What did you have?

1301
01:10:42,180 --> 01:10:43,410
Ravioli.

1302
01:10:44,850 --> 01:10:46,840
The food was already on the table?

1303
01:10:47,620 --> 01:10:49,280
No, they were serving it.

1304
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:52,420
And did you see the guys coming?

1305
01:10:54,630 --> 01:10:55,820
One of them.

1306
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:59,330
Dressed Iike a busboy.

1307
01:11:00,670 --> 01:11:02,400
Your father saw him too?

1308
01:11:04,670 --> 01:11:06,230
I knew the guy Iooked wrong.

1309
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:07,530
Why, Paul?

1310
01:11:08,010 --> 01:11:11,140
The pants. Looked too good for a busboy.

1311
01:11:12,350 --> 01:11:14,310
So he walked to the table.

1312
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:16,450
I watched him the whole way.

1313
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:18,310
Did you say anything?

1314
01:11:23,690 --> 01:11:26,850
Dad was so mad at me, I couldn't say anything.

1315
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:28,590
And you were mad at him.

1316
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:32,100
And then what happened?

1317
01:11:32,330 --> 01:11:35,630
I never saw the second guy. My mother just started screaming.

1318
01:11:36,270 --> 01:11:38,170
And you blame yourself.

1319
01:11:38,470 --> 01:11:40,840
I could've saved him.

1320
01:11:41,140 --> 01:11:42,570
But you were mad at him.

1321
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:44,570
I should've said something.

1322
01:11:44,780 --> 01:11:46,750
You couldn't have saved him, Paul.

1323
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:48,670
I killed him.

1324
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:51,240
You didn't kill him.

1325
01:11:51,450 --> 01:11:54,390
You were mad, but you didn't kill him. It's the Iife he chose.

1326
01:11:54,590 --> 01:11:56,890
I just Iet him die.

1327
01:11:58,190 --> 01:12:00,680
I Iet him die!

1328
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:08,300
I Iet him die, and I couldn't say goodbye to him.

1329
01:12:10,740 --> 01:12:12,600
So why don't you say it now?

1330
01:12:12,810 --> 01:12:15,040
Tell him. If he was here, what would you say?

1331
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:16,540
-I can't. -Yes, you can.

1332
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:17,840
I can't.

1333
01:12:18,050 --> 01:12:19,170
No, I can't.

1334
01:12:19,380 --> 01:12:20,370
Tell him, Paul.

1335
01:12:21,620 --> 01:12:23,380
I want to say I'm....

1336
01:12:23,580 --> 01:12:25,210
Dad, I'm sorry.

1337
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:29,690
I'm sorry.

1338
01:12:31,130 --> 01:12:32,720
I'm sorry, Dad.

1339
01:12:34,230 --> 01:12:36,720
I'm sorry. I Iet him die.

1340
01:12:38,130 --> 01:12:40,600
I'm sorry, Dad.

1341
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:44,330
Jesus.

1342
01:12:45,410 --> 01:12:47,430
Poor guy's falling apart.

1343
01:12:47,710 --> 01:12:49,140
Why don't he just pop him?

1344
01:12:49,340 --> 01:12:52,280
It's embarrassing standing here Iike this.

1345
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:53,780
Shut up.

1346
01:13:02,020 --> 01:13:03,220
You couldn't save him.

1347
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:04,980
I know I could've. I could've.

1348
01:13:05,190 --> 01:13:07,220
No, he was trying to save you.

1349
01:13:07,430 --> 01:13:09,190
That's what you fought about.

1350
01:13:09,430 --> 01:13:11,030
He didn't want this for you.

1351
01:13:11,030 --> 01:13:13,030
And you don't want it for Anthony.

1352
01:13:13,270 --> 01:13:14,260
No, I don't!

1353
01:13:14,470 --> 01:13:17,800
You don't want him to grow up Iike you did, without a father.

1354
01:13:24,110 --> 01:13:26,080
Your father's not dead, Paul.

1355
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:29,840
He's alive in you. And he's trying to tell you something.

1356
01:13:30,050 --> 01:13:31,310
He's trying to tell you...

1357
01:13:31,590 --> 01:13:33,080
Holy shit!

1358
01:13:34,990 --> 01:13:37,580
They're shooting! They're shooting!

1359
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:45,720
-Pull yourself together! -I feel so bad!

1360
01:13:46,030 --> 01:13:48,470
You're going to feel a Iot worse.

1361
01:13:52,670 --> 01:13:55,200
Time to channel all this nice grief...

1362
01:13:55,610 --> 01:13:56,910
...into a murderous rage.

1363
01:13:59,010 --> 01:14:00,570
Come on! Time to shoot back!

1364
01:14:00,810 --> 01:14:03,010
Let's go! Here we go! Bang, bang!

1365
01:14:04,420 --> 01:14:06,650
Bang, bang! Come on. Let's go.

1366
01:14:06,850 --> 01:14:09,080
Come on! Bang, bang!

1367
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:11,110
Now come on. Paul, here.

1368
01:14:11,330 --> 01:14:13,790
Put the gun in your hand and shoot!

1369
01:14:13,990 --> 01:14:16,520
For God sakes, shoot somebody!

1370
01:14:18,830 --> 01:14:20,660
Give me the fucking gun!

1371
01:14:38,990 --> 01:14:40,390
Stay down.

1372
01:14:41,990 --> 01:14:43,460
Paul, you okay?

1373
01:14:43,690 --> 01:14:45,020
Yeah, I'm okay.

1374
01:14:46,390 --> 01:14:47,860
Jelly, did I do that?

1375
01:14:48,430 --> 01:14:49,690
No, Doc.

1376
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:51,020
That one's mine.

1377
01:14:51,230 --> 01:14:52,990
You get the '72 Chevy...

1378
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:56,530
...and the Amana side-by-side refrigerator-freezer.

1379
01:14:57,300 --> 01:14:58,170
You okay, Paul?

1380
01:14:58,370 --> 01:14:59,770
Yeah, I'm okay.

1381
01:14:59,970 --> 01:15:01,910
I'm going to check on Jimmy.

1382
01:15:09,350 --> 01:15:11,410
Pretty fucking ironic, ain't it?

1383
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:14,710
You can give me back the gun now.

1384
01:15:15,660 --> 01:15:18,490
It's okay. I wasn't really going to whack you.

1385
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:22,090
AII right, maybe I was going to whack you.

1386
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:25,030
But I was real conflicted about it.

1387
01:15:25,230 --> 01:15:26,630
Progress, right?

1388
01:15:32,610 --> 01:15:34,340
I can't see you anymore.

1389
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:36,740
I know.

1390
01:15:39,180 --> 01:15:41,010
You hit some very big stuff tonight.

1391
01:15:41,220 --> 01:15:43,620
So you'II probably feel Iike this for a while.

1392
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:46,180
But you're close to something.

1393
01:15:47,090 --> 01:15:48,490
The rest is up to you.

1394
01:15:49,690 --> 01:15:50,680
Good Iuck.

1395
01:15:59,230 --> 01:16:01,670
I want to please him when we're in bed...

1396
01:16:01,870 --> 01:16:05,360
...but whatever I do, it seems Iike it's never enough.

1397
01:16:05,710 --> 01:16:09,010
Now he wants me to say things when we're making Iove.

1398
01:16:12,950 --> 01:16:15,440
What kind of things does he want you to say?

1399
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:18,220
Well, he wants me to call him...

1400
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:19,820
..."big boy"...

1401
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:24,050
...and he's my "bucking bronco"...

1402
01:16:24,890 --> 01:16:27,020
...and I'm supposed to "ride him hard"...

1403
01:16:27,230 --> 01:16:30,130
...and "put him back in the barn wet."

1404
01:16:41,170 --> 01:16:42,570
Are you okay, Dr. Sobol?

1405
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:45,480
Well, it's....

1406
01:16:48,220 --> 01:16:50,480
Here's what I think you should do, EIaine.

1407
01:16:51,550 --> 01:16:54,020
I would do whatever he says.

1408
01:16:54,690 --> 01:16:56,950
If he wants you to talk, talk.

1409
01:16:57,160 --> 01:16:58,920
I'd get on all fours and bark Iike a dog.

1410
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:00,460
I'd do whatever it takes.

1411
01:17:00,660 --> 01:17:02,990
Smoke some joints, drink wine, whatever it is...

1412
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:05,360
...to get off on each other and be happy.

1413
01:17:05,570 --> 01:17:06,790
Where are you running?

1414
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,830
This is a time to be happy!

1415
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:11,560
Because Iife is just too short.

1416
01:17:11,770 --> 01:17:15,110
It's just too fucking short.

1417
01:17:23,950 --> 01:17:25,510
I'II see you Thursday.

1418
01:17:30,690 --> 01:17:31,920
Everything okay?

1419
01:17:35,060 --> 01:17:36,500
Feeling all right?

1420
01:17:36,700 --> 01:17:38,130
You need anything?

1421
01:17:38,330 --> 01:17:39,360
No. Feel great.

1422
01:17:39,570 --> 01:17:41,300
Never felt better.

1423
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:45,630
Wait'II I go to that meeting. I'm going to knock them dead.

1424
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:49,040
AII right. I'II be outside.

1425
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:56,680
When I look at him...

1426
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:59,250
...I think about how different it was.

1427
01:17:59,690 --> 01:18:02,450
Was providing for a family simpler back then...

1428
01:18:02,660 --> 01:18:05,150
...or did he just make it look that way?

1429
01:18:08,660 --> 01:18:10,720
Decisions are tougher now.

1430
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,460
There 's so much information...

1431
01:18:12,670 --> 01:18:15,070
...so many ways to invest.

1432
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:24,510
Strange. I spent the first half of my life...

1433
01:18:24,710 --> 01:18:26,940
...not wanting to walk in his footsteps.

1434
01:18:27,180 --> 01:18:29,380
Now I only wish I could.

1435
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:34,650
Times are more complex.

1436
01:18:34,860 --> 01:18:37,850
Ask a Merrill Lynch financial consultant who can help with a plan.

1437
01:18:38,060 --> 01:18:41,690
And more ways to make the plan work than anyone else.

1438
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:54,530
You Iook beautiful, honey.

1439
01:19:06,150 --> 01:19:09,420
We are put on this earth to find a Iove, a soul mate...

1440
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:12,520
...someone with whom we can create joy.

1441
01:19:12,730 --> 01:19:13,890
And how glad we are...

1442
01:19:14,090 --> 01:19:15,860
...that Ben and Laura have found each other.

1443
01:19:16,060 --> 01:19:17,890
And we anticipate and celebrate...

1444
01:19:18,130 --> 01:19:21,360
...the years of joy they will share together from this day on.

1445
01:19:24,340 --> 01:19:26,570
Do you take Laura to be your wedded wife...

1446
01:19:26,810 --> 01:19:28,830
...for richer or poorer, in sickness and in health...

1447
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:31,030
...till death do you part, so help you God?

1448
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:32,110
-No! -What?

1449
01:19:32,310 --> 01:19:33,640
Excuse me?

1450
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:36,240
I wasn't talking to you. I was talking to him.

1451
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:37,710
Who him?

1452
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:39,150
It's not important. Yes.

1453
01:19:39,650 --> 01:19:40,640
Yes what?

1454
01:19:40,850 --> 01:19:42,790
Yes to the first part. To her.

1455
01:19:42,990 --> 01:19:44,980
That's a yes. Pick it up from there.

1456
01:19:45,660 --> 01:19:47,520
Doc, this is an emergency.

1457
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:49,750
-I don't believe this. -This is my wedding!

1458
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:50,860
Want me to make a scene?

1459
01:19:51,060 --> 01:19:51,930
Bigger than this?

1460
01:19:52,230 --> 01:19:53,060
Jesus!

1461
01:19:54,170 --> 01:19:55,660
Tick-tock. Let's go.

1462
01:19:55,870 --> 01:19:56,700
Hurry up. Pronounce.

1463
01:19:56,940 --> 01:19:59,960
By the power vested in me, I now pronounce you man and wife.

1464
01:20:00,940 --> 01:20:02,340
Ring, ring. IKiss, kiss.

1465
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:06,380
Here. Fine. Good. Okay, just go.

1466
01:20:06,580 --> 01:20:08,880
Sorry, Mrs. Sobol. Duty calls.

1467
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:11,640
You're the first person to call me Mrs. Sobol.

1468
01:20:12,190 --> 01:20:13,020
Nice?

1469
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:25,920
I'm telling you, Doc, this is serious.

1470
01:20:26,130 --> 01:20:28,290
If he don't make that meeting, they'II kill him.

1471
01:20:28,540 --> 01:20:30,590
Can't somebody else in the family go for him?

1472
01:20:30,870 --> 01:20:34,000
What about Tommy the Tongue or Louie the Lip?

1473
01:20:34,210 --> 01:20:35,870
What about you? Why don't you go?

1474
01:20:36,180 --> 01:20:39,300
That would be a very good idea, except for one Iittle detail.

1475
01:20:39,550 --> 01:20:42,450
I'm a fucking moron. I'm known for it.

1476
01:20:42,850 --> 01:20:44,870
-You got to go. -You must be a moron.

1477
01:20:45,050 --> 01:20:46,450
-Watch it! -You just said it.

1478
01:20:46,650 --> 01:20:50,020
When I say it, it's different. When you say it, it sounds negative.

1479
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:52,350
Jelly, I am not going to any meeting.

1480
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:55,260
I am no Ionger on the payroll. Do you understand that?

1481
01:20:55,460 --> 01:20:58,060
Now, I am going back to my wife.

1482
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:04,670
Now, Jelly, we've been through this before.

1483
01:21:04,910 --> 01:21:06,240
You can't shoot me.

1484
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:07,600
Correction:

1485
01:21:08,410 --> 01:21:10,900
It was Mr. Vitti who couldn't shoot you.

1486
01:21:12,580 --> 01:21:14,740
You're going to that meeting.

1487
01:21:19,090 --> 01:21:22,520
This is Surveillance 6. They've Ieft the building and are heading east.

1488
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:24,050
Roger that.

1489
01:21:27,530 --> 01:21:28,960
-Put this on. -Is this chrome?

1490
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:30,560
I can see my own reflection.

1491
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:32,200
Let me tell you something.

1492
01:21:32,430 --> 01:21:34,230
That's a $ 1,200 Valentino suit.

1493
01:21:34,430 --> 01:21:35,990
If you spill anything on it...

1494
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:38,030
...I'm going to mess you up good.

1495
01:21:38,270 --> 01:21:40,540
Shut up! You're making him nervous.

1496
01:21:40,770 --> 01:21:42,970
If he fucks up, they'II kill him for sure.

1497
01:21:43,180 --> 01:21:44,840
What? This is insane!

1498
01:21:45,050 --> 01:21:45,880
It's all right.

1499
01:21:46,110 --> 01:21:48,880
Let's go over it again. Mr. Vitti's been detained.

1500
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:51,140
Apologies all around.

1501
01:21:51,890 --> 01:21:54,620
And then you say you're the new consigliere...

1502
01:21:54,820 --> 01:21:56,480
...speaking for Mr. Vitti.

1503
01:21:56,690 --> 01:21:57,550
Then what?

1504
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:01,320
Then you keep your mouth shut and hope nobody asks you nothing.

1505
01:22:01,630 --> 01:22:03,390
That's some plan you got there.

1506
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:07,120
Shut up! Doc, if you got to talk...

1507
01:22:07,470 --> 01:22:09,560
...try to be vague. Could you do that?

1508
01:22:09,770 --> 01:22:12,740
I'm a psychiatrist. Believe me, I can be vague.

1509
01:22:15,740 --> 01:22:17,730
Looks like they're headed for the tunnel.

1510
01:22:20,250 --> 01:22:22,650
We'll pick them up on the other side.

1511
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:29,410
Here they come.

1512
01:22:32,990 --> 01:22:33,820
Which one is it?

1513
01:22:34,030 --> 01:22:35,690
The black one.

1514
01:22:48,340 --> 01:22:50,640
Are you sure you don't want something to eat?

1515
01:22:52,450 --> 01:22:54,350
You want some iced tea?

1516
01:22:55,850 --> 01:22:58,040
I think I' m going to call Dr. Terragrossa.

1517
01:22:58,250 --> 01:23:00,220
Is Daddy going to be all right?

1518
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:03,520
I think so, honey.

1519
01:23:03,890 --> 01:23:05,820
Shouldn't you be outside playing?

1520
01:23:06,530 --> 01:23:08,080
No, it's all right.

1521
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,620
How Iong you going to sit there?

1522
01:23:12,130 --> 01:23:13,860
How Iong you going to Iay there?

1523
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:19,200
I'm done.

1524
01:23:57,310 --> 01:23:58,400
Let's go.

1525
01:24:00,650 --> 01:24:02,080
It'II be all right, Doc.

1526
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:20,200
There's no way I can get away with this.

1527
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:22,090
Jelly, I can't do this!

1528
01:24:22,300 --> 01:24:24,030
Don't fucking whine.

1529
01:24:24,270 --> 01:24:26,530
Whining's a dead giveaway.

1530
01:24:26,770 --> 01:24:27,830
BIend.

1531
01:24:28,340 --> 01:24:29,540
BIend in.

1532
01:24:36,780 --> 01:24:38,270
So where's Vitti?

1533
01:24:38,790 --> 01:24:40,050
He ain't here.

1534
01:24:40,250 --> 01:24:41,550
He ain't here.

1535
01:24:41,790 --> 01:24:42,720
How you doing?

1536
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:45,450
How you doing? How you been? AII right?

1537
01:24:46,130 --> 01:24:47,180
AII right.

1538
01:24:47,990 --> 01:24:49,990
Hey, when'd you guys get out?

1539
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:52,130
You need anything, you Iet me know.

1540
01:25:00,370 --> 01:25:01,840
Easter weekend.

1541
01:25:03,540 --> 01:25:04,910
You're a planet!

1542
01:25:08,820 --> 01:25:10,080
BIending, enough.

1543
01:25:13,390 --> 01:25:14,880
Who's the guy with Jelly?

1544
01:25:15,220 --> 01:25:16,850
I never seen him before.

1545
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,860
What's going on? Where's Paul?

1546
01:25:26,330 --> 01:25:27,660
He'II be here. Don't worry.

1547
01:25:27,870 --> 01:25:29,660
And what's he doing here?

1548
01:25:30,670 --> 01:25:31,800
He's just....

1549
01:25:32,870 --> 01:25:34,340
Forget about it.

1550
01:25:34,710 --> 01:25:36,000
Forget about it?

1551
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:38,440
What the hell is that? "Forget about it."

1552
01:25:39,010 --> 01:25:42,210
I can't do this. No, I can't do this.

1553
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:45,180
I think we're going to get started here.

1554
01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:47,820
We got a Iot to talk about here today, and...

1555
01:25:48,020 --> 01:25:51,050
...for now, we'II just stick with the more important issues.

1556
01:25:51,260 --> 01:25:52,320
And one more thing...

1557
01:25:52,530 --> 01:25:54,430
...if you got anything to say...

1558
01:25:54,630 --> 01:25:57,760
...Iet us know who you are, because a Iot of us don't know each other.

1559
01:25:57,960 --> 01:26:02,460
I didn't think anybody here was into wearing fucking nametags.

1560
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:12,970
I'm Primo Sindone.

1561
01:26:13,210 --> 01:26:15,150
They call me Sonny Long.

1562
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:17,820
Some of you know me as Mikey Gaga.

1563
01:26:18,050 --> 01:26:19,950
Some of you know me as Joey Boombots.

1564
01:26:20,150 --> 01:26:23,880
Be as it may, it's good to see so many of the old faces here...

1565
01:26:24,060 --> 01:26:26,920
...and to welcome some of the new ones from all over the country.

1566
01:26:28,190 --> 01:26:29,590
I see Joe Baldassare...

1567
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:30,890
...Frankie Zello.

1568
01:26:32,430 --> 01:26:36,330
But I'm disappointed the head of our other New York family isn't here.

1569
01:26:37,070 --> 01:26:40,700
AII I see is his man Jelly and some sawed-off prick nobody knows.

1570
01:26:48,820 --> 01:26:50,610
The thing is...

1571
01:26:50,820 --> 01:26:53,980
...Mr. Vitti's been detained.

1572
01:26:55,590 --> 01:26:56,990
PIus, he's sorry...

1573
01:26:57,190 --> 01:26:58,490
...for his detainment.

1574
01:26:58,730 --> 01:26:59,780
Detained?

1575
01:27:00,230 --> 01:27:01,560
What kind of bullshit is that?

1576
01:27:02,130 --> 01:27:04,150
What's more important than this?

1577
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:08,160
As the host, I take his not being here as a sign of disrespect to me...

1578
01:27:08,330 --> 01:27:11,460
...and all these other men who came a Iong way to be here.

1579
01:27:12,710 --> 01:27:14,570
I mean, no. I mean...

1580
01:27:14,770 --> 01:27:17,400
You see, the thing is that he's not feeling well.

1581
01:27:17,610 --> 01:27:19,440
PIus, he don't feel good.

1582
01:27:21,950 --> 01:27:23,510
What's the matter with you?

1583
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:25,980
We never discuss Mr. Vitti's health outside the family.

1584
01:27:26,190 --> 01:27:27,980
You know better than that.

1585
01:27:28,420 --> 01:27:29,450
Sit down.

1586
01:27:30,420 --> 01:27:31,980
Sit down!

1587
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:34,150
You want a fresh one?

1588
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:38,460
Who is this guy?

1589
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:40,360
What the fuck is he doing here?

1590
01:27:40,570 --> 01:27:41,560
Who I am?

1591
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:43,670
"Who I am? " "Who am I? "

1592
01:27:43,870 --> 01:27:45,670
"Who am I? " is a question for the ages.

1593
01:27:45,870 --> 01:27:48,670
That's one we're all searching for, to find out who I am.

1594
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:51,000
Who's in there, who wants to come out and go...

1595
01:27:51,210 --> 01:27:52,540
..."Hey, I'm hungry."

1596
01:27:52,910 --> 01:27:54,400
"Who I am"...

1597
01:27:54,750 --> 01:27:56,870
...is too deep and....

1598
01:27:57,150 --> 01:27:59,120
You got to go in deep and pull out the thing...

1599
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:02,220
...Iike that movie where the thing came out of the stomach...

1600
01:28:02,420 --> 01:28:04,650
...and ate the people on the fucking spaceship.

1601
01:28:04,860 --> 01:28:06,420
May they rest in peace.

1602
01:28:06,660 --> 01:28:08,520
My name is Ben Sobol.

1603
01:28:09,930 --> 01:28:11,020
Leone.

1604
01:28:11,230 --> 01:28:12,600
Ben Soboleone.

1605
01:28:12,930 --> 01:28:14,590
I'm also known...

1606
01:28:14,870 --> 01:28:18,670
...as Benny the Groin, Sammy the Schnoz...

1607
01:28:18,870 --> 01:28:21,270
...EImer the Fudd, Tubby the Tuba...

1608
01:28:21,510 --> 01:28:24,000
...and once as Miss Phyllis Levine.

1609
01:28:24,210 --> 01:28:26,270
But that was at a party. It was years ago.

1610
01:28:26,510 --> 01:28:28,810
I smoked a titibet, and I had a Quaquaalude...

1611
01:28:29,020 --> 01:28:31,750
...and suddenly I'm in fishnets singing show tunes.

1612
01:28:31,950 --> 01:28:34,280
These things happen, but has nothing to do...

1613
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:37,250
...with what I'm here with you fine gentlemen today.

1614
01:28:37,460 --> 01:28:38,580
So I apologize.

1615
01:28:38,790 --> 01:28:42,750
That being said, I'm also known to the people who know me the best...

1616
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:44,990
...as the fucking "Doctor."

1617
01:28:45,530 --> 01:28:49,660
The second part of your question that you "axed" me...

1618
01:28:49,870 --> 01:28:53,100
...is "Why am I here? " I am here...

1619
01:28:53,740 --> 01:28:57,040
...representing Mr. Paul Vitti as his consigligliere.

1620
01:28:58,880 --> 01:28:59,740
Consigliere.

1621
01:29:03,820 --> 01:29:06,380
Never correct me in public again.

1622
01:29:06,590 --> 01:29:08,420
Do you understand that?

1623
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:11,750
You broke my heart, Jelly.

1624
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:14,020
You broke my heart.

1625
01:29:16,660 --> 01:29:19,860
I apologize for the second interruption.

1626
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:23,340
As Mr. Vitti's...

1627
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:25,230
...consigliere...

1628
01:29:26,970 --> 01:29:30,410
...I am involved in all aspects of the Vitti family business...

1629
01:29:30,610 --> 01:29:33,140
...and am prepared to speak for Mr. Vitti on all matters.

1630
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:37,740
Okay, Doctor.

1631
01:29:37,950 --> 01:29:39,820
Let's stop with the bullshit.

1632
01:29:42,690 --> 01:29:44,590
There's been this thing between me...

1633
01:29:44,790 --> 01:29:46,420
...and Paul Vitti for a Iong time.

1634
01:29:47,860 --> 01:29:51,190
Are you talking about the first thing or the second thing?

1635
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:53,660
What second thing? I only know one thing.

1636
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:58,160
How can we bring up the first if we don't talk about the second?

1637
01:29:58,370 --> 01:29:59,700
Did you talk to the guy?

1638
01:30:00,010 --> 01:30:00,870
What guy?

1639
01:30:01,940 --> 01:30:03,670
The guy with the thing!

1640
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:05,780
What thing? What are you talking about?

1641
01:30:05,980 --> 01:30:08,000
How should I know? You brought it up!

1642
01:30:08,210 --> 01:30:10,150
This is the problem. Do you see this?

1643
01:30:10,350 --> 01:30:12,010
You see what's happening here?

1644
01:30:12,220 --> 01:30:15,880
You can't have an intelligent conversation with this guy.

1645
01:30:18,060 --> 01:30:21,390
What if I put two bullets in your brain? What do you think of that?

1646
01:30:21,630 --> 01:30:24,190
That's a Iittle dark. What do you think?

1647
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:28,270
It's a good idea. Why would I say it if I didn't think it was good?

1648
01:30:28,470 --> 01:30:29,630
I don't know. Why would you?

1649
01:30:30,170 --> 01:30:32,140
I wouldn't! That's what I'm saying!

1650
01:30:33,970 --> 01:30:37,200
Look at what's happening here. Look at you.

1651
01:30:37,810 --> 01:30:41,440
Do you feel you have to get angry so people will Iisten to you?

1652
01:30:41,650 --> 01:30:42,810
Is that your deal?

1653
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:44,140
What is he saying?

1654
01:30:44,350 --> 01:30:46,940
You do have a tendency to get angry a Iot.

1655
01:30:47,150 --> 01:30:48,640
I agree, Primo.

1656
01:30:48,860 --> 01:30:51,380
T alk about Vitti. Why are we talking about me?

1657
01:30:52,260 --> 01:30:53,660
That's interesting too.

1658
01:30:53,930 --> 01:30:58,490
Do you feel you're not important enough for us to discuss you?

1659
01:30:58,730 --> 01:31:00,430
-What does that mean? -What do you think?

1660
01:31:00,670 --> 01:31:01,930
Fuck you!

1661
01:31:02,440 --> 01:31:03,730
Calm down.

1662
01:31:03,940 --> 01:31:06,100
This prick won't stop with the questions.

1663
01:31:06,310 --> 01:31:07,290
Pass the fruit.

1664
01:31:07,510 --> 01:31:08,500
You're a dead man!

1665
01:31:13,950 --> 01:31:15,070
Put it down.

1666
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:17,670
Put it down.

1667
01:31:23,860 --> 01:31:26,790
-Wait in the car. IKeep it running. -How are you feeling?

1668
01:31:27,030 --> 01:31:28,930
Sit down. I'II take it from here.

1669
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:30,030
Sit down.

1670
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:34,870
I'm Paul Vitti.

1671
01:31:35,370 --> 01:31:39,030
I'm sorry I was Iate. Those who know me know I meant no disrespect.

1672
01:31:39,910 --> 01:31:41,700
If it's all right with you...

1673
01:31:41,970 --> 01:31:45,340
...I just want to say something. Then I'II Ieave you to your business.

1674
01:31:45,550 --> 01:31:49,380
About 2 1 /2 weeks ago, somebody killed my dear friend, Dominic Manetta.

1675
01:31:51,450 --> 01:31:52,920
Come on, this is bullshit.

1676
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:56,210
Everybody knows he whacked out Dominic so he could take over.

1677
01:31:56,590 --> 01:31:57,720
Whatever.

1678
01:31:57,920 --> 01:32:02,830
What I came to say is I've come to a very important decision in my Iife.

1679
01:32:03,060 --> 01:32:04,460
And that is...

1680
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:06,730
...I want out.

1681
01:32:07,270 --> 01:32:09,060
I don't want to do this no more.

1682
01:32:10,640 --> 01:32:12,600
I'm going to go away for a while...

1683
01:32:12,810 --> 01:32:15,930
...but I will respect the oath I took the day I was made...

1684
01:32:16,140 --> 01:32:19,600
...and what I know about anybody's business I take to the grave.

1685
01:32:19,810 --> 01:32:21,440
You have my word.

1686
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:24,570
As for my own family...

1687
01:32:25,250 --> 01:32:28,240
...I know Carlo Mangano would Iike to be the new boss.

1688
01:32:28,450 --> 01:32:29,610
Thank you, Paul.

1689
01:32:29,820 --> 01:32:32,090
That's why he betrayed Dominic and me to our enemies...

1690
01:32:32,290 --> 01:32:34,760
...and sent his own man to Miami to try and kill me.

1691
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:36,360
I swear you got this wrong...

1692
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:37,760
Shut your mouth.

1693
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:40,860
Even though it's my right, I won't take revenge.

1694
01:32:41,100 --> 01:32:43,760
You want to know why? Because you got a problem.

1695
01:32:43,970 --> 01:32:45,700
A problem with aggression.

1696
01:32:45,940 --> 01:32:47,700
Maybe you weren't hugged as a kid.

1697
01:32:47,940 --> 01:32:49,770
You ought to Iook inside yourself...

1698
01:32:49,980 --> 01:32:52,740
...Iook inside and find out who you are.

1699
01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:55,310
Because for me...

1700
01:32:55,620 --> 01:32:56,810
...I had a breakthrough.

1701
01:32:57,020 --> 01:33:01,110
I'm in a good place mentally, and I'm feeling good about me.

1702
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:03,950
I don't know, Paul.

1703
01:33:04,860 --> 01:33:08,820
I can see where some people might have a problem with this.

1704
01:33:09,030 --> 01:33:09,960
I realize that.

1705
01:33:10,160 --> 01:33:11,890
So as a token of good faith...

1706
01:33:12,130 --> 01:33:14,400
...I've taken the Iiberty of writing down a few things...

1707
01:33:14,630 --> 01:33:17,190
...putting them in a safe-deposit box in case...

1708
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:20,300
...something should happen to me, my friend or my family.

1709
01:33:28,180 --> 01:33:30,480
I don't know what anybody else thinks...

1710
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:33,280
...but I say good Iuck and God bless, Paul.

1711
01:33:37,990 --> 01:33:40,080
Thank you. Come on, Iet's go.

1712
01:33:40,490 --> 01:33:42,290
I'm his friend.

1713
01:33:50,100 --> 01:33:52,330
That was remarkable. Do you feel proud?

1714
01:33:52,570 --> 01:33:56,600
Some people in therapy never have breakthroughs Iike you had.

1715
01:33:59,350 --> 01:34:00,710
I don't want to do this.

1716
01:34:00,950 --> 01:34:04,880
Think this is a civil service job? You can just quit and walk away?

1717
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:06,740
What are you, fucking crazy?

1718
01:34:06,950 --> 01:34:08,510
Not anymore.

1719
01:34:08,790 --> 01:34:09,880
Tell me something.

1720
01:34:10,120 --> 01:34:13,350
Will you stab me in the back Iike the shit I always knew you were?

1721
01:34:13,690 --> 01:34:15,490
No, I won't stab you in the back.

1722
01:34:16,030 --> 01:34:17,960
I want to see your face when I do it.

1723
01:34:19,230 --> 01:34:20,720
I don't think so.

1724
01:34:20,970 --> 01:34:21,800
Mo-Mo!

1725
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:24,070
Bigs!

1726
01:34:24,740 --> 01:34:25,640
Eddie!

1727
01:34:29,410 --> 01:34:31,310
It's over, Primo.

1728
01:34:31,740 --> 01:34:33,740
Now get the fuck out of here.

1729
01:34:41,750 --> 01:34:44,090
Machine gun was a nice touch. A Iittle hostile.

1730
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:19,720
Hands in the air!

1731
01:35:19,960 --> 01:35:21,550
Drop your weapons!

1732
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:23,290
Do it now!

1733
01:35:35,110 --> 01:35:36,940
I got you! Get down!

1734
01:35:41,210 --> 01:35:43,550
Get out of the car! Hands on top of the car!

1735
01:35:43,750 --> 01:35:46,840
One fucking move, I swear I'II blow your fucking heart out!

1736
01:35:47,050 --> 01:35:49,710
Take a pill, RoboCop! Take a pill!

1737
01:35:51,620 --> 01:35:53,680
I can't believe this. You took a bullet for me.

1738
01:35:53,890 --> 01:35:57,560
What doc would ever do that for his patient? I'II never forget that.

1739
01:35:57,760 --> 01:35:59,060
You...!

1740
01:36:00,770 --> 01:36:01,890
I tripped.

1741
01:36:02,100 --> 01:36:05,000
You tripped! You tripped over your unconscious.

1742
01:36:06,070 --> 01:36:09,630
Mr. Vitti, you have the right to remain silent....

1743
01:36:13,350 --> 01:36:15,250
Today's my wedding day.

1744
01:36:26,530 --> 01:36:28,890
You got off easy. Eighteen months is nothing.

1745
01:36:29,090 --> 01:36:32,000
They found Primo Sindone dead in a field near La Guardia.

1746
01:36:32,200 --> 01:36:35,170
I heard. Don't Iook at me. I had nothing to do with it.

1747
01:36:35,370 --> 01:36:39,360
A million guys from here to Canarsie were Iooking to whack that bastard.

1748
01:36:39,610 --> 01:36:41,770
Good. I was just checking.

1749
01:36:42,310 --> 01:36:43,500
Don't worry.

1750
01:36:45,010 --> 01:36:48,280
You think we could keep going with the private sessions up here?

1751
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:50,010
You'd Iike to do that?

1752
01:36:50,820 --> 01:36:54,250
I could arrange to come up on Saturdays. Or we could do it by phone.

1753
01:36:54,450 --> 01:36:55,550
Phone appointments?

1754
01:36:55,790 --> 01:36:59,620
I do that when a patient's out of town or in federal prison.

1755
01:37:06,130 --> 01:37:07,260
Thanks, Doc.

1756
01:37:15,640 --> 01:37:18,370
I never really got to thank you properly...

1757
01:37:19,480 --> 01:37:20,540
...for curing me.

1758
01:37:22,050 --> 01:37:25,480
We don't say "cure." We say you had a "corrective emotional experience."

1759
01:37:25,680 --> 01:37:26,910
Excuse me.

1760
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:29,550
You're something, you.

1761
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:32,250
Yes, you are. You are something.

1762
01:37:33,190 --> 01:37:34,560
No, you're something.

1763
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:36,820
You!

1764
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:46,600
Happy?

1765
01:37:47,170 --> 01:37:48,700
I just can't get used to it.

1766
01:37:48,910 --> 01:37:49,900
Used to what?

1767
01:37:50,110 --> 01:37:52,200
It's been so Iong since you were kidnapped.

1768
01:37:52,410 --> 01:37:54,350
I don't know if I can adjust.

1769
01:37:56,350 --> 01:37:57,250
Listen.

1770
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:00,910
How about one more dance...

1771
01:38:01,450 --> 01:38:03,110
...and then we'II go upstairs?

1772
01:38:06,530 --> 01:38:08,930
Tony, can you do one more song?

1773
01:38:09,730 --> 01:38:10,920
Anything you want.

1774
01:38:11,660 --> 01:38:14,430
My friend told me to stay as Iong as you needed me.

1775
01:38:14,630 --> 01:38:15,930
I don't want to Iet him down.

1776
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:18,600
"World On A String," the Harold Arlen song.

1777
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:20,270
This is so great.

1778
01:38:22,170 --> 01:38:23,900
This is a gift.

1779
01:38:24,940 --> 01:38:26,740
I've got the world on a string

1780
01:38:27,780 --> 01:38:29,940
I'm sitting on a rainbow

1781
01:38:31,150 --> 01:38:33,050
I've got the string

1782
01:38:33,250 --> 01:38:35,280
Around my finger

1783
01:38:37,620 --> 01:38:40,350
What a world What a life

1784
01:38:41,990 --> 01:38:43,550
I'm in love

1785
01:40:04,410 --> 01:40:06,070
Good night. Sobols.
