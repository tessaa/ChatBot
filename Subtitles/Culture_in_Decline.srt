1
00:00:00,604 --> 00:00:04,671
- Modest preemptive actions can obviate the need

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:08,160
of more drastic actions at a later date.

3
00:00:08,301 --> 00:00:11,853
- You think that you've been taught things like confidence intervals

4
00:00:11,993 --> 00:00:15,109
in an elementary statistical course that would let you do this;

5
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,382
but if you really studied carefully,

6
00:00:17,522 --> 00:00:19,641
you'd know that they don't let you do this.

7
00:00:19,782 --> 00:00:23,551
A really principled frequentist can't produce a probability distribution...

8
00:00:23,692 --> 00:00:26,658
- The conclusion we want to point out when we think about valuation

9
00:00:26,797 --> 00:00:30,483
is the fact that means are scarce. I alluded to this already that

10
00:00:30,623 --> 00:00:33,802
as finite beings we can't will our ends to be attained.

11
00:00:33,942 --> 00:00:38,803
- A statistical description of the government's net-of-interest surplus.

12
00:00:38,944 --> 00:00:43,573
- ...deflation, I think that yields could drop to say, less than 1%

13
00:00:43,713 --> 00:00:47,102
on the 10 years and less than 2% on the 30 years...

14
00:00:47,241 --> 00:00:50,733
- ...that would effectively be a takeover of monetary policy by the Congress. - Oh, hello!

15
00:00:50,874 --> 00:00:54,472
Daunting, right? Might even make you feel stupid.

16
00:00:54,612 --> 00:00:56,603
Perhaps it's no wonder then,

17
00:00:56,743 --> 00:00:59,784
while even with the ongoing economic failures across the world:

18
00:00:59,924 --> 00:01:02,981
inequality, increasing poverty, debt collapse,

19
00:01:03,121 --> 00:01:05,533
bank failures, unemployment rising,

20
00:01:05,673 --> 00:01:08,534
very few today seem to be able to understand,

21
00:01:08,674 --> 00:01:11,156
let alone discuss, modern economics,

22
00:01:11,296 --> 00:01:13,296
outside, of course, the delegation game

23
00:01:13,396 --> 00:01:15,587
where the only attempted solutions people know

24
00:01:15,727 --> 00:01:19,511
is the mere shifting around of the deck chairs on the Titanic,

25
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:24,322
assuming some new politician, central bank policy, or corporate legislation

26
00:01:24,462 --> 00:01:26,542
is going to save the day.

27
00:01:26,682 --> 00:01:31,123
Some years back, after coming to the conclusion that our politicians,

28
00:01:31,263 --> 00:01:36,606
legislators, and established authorities just might be provably incompetent

29
00:01:36,746 --> 00:01:40,849
when it comes to the truly intelligent management of our society,

30
00:01:40,989 --> 00:01:44,546
I started to look for questions and answers on my own,

31
00:01:45,179 --> 00:01:47,935
asking those questions about things

32
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:51,754
that many today either seem to take for granted, ignore or even worse,

33
00:01:51,894 --> 00:01:55,580
assume that they have no capacity or business investigating at all,

34
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:58,159
since our credentialed authorities in control

35
00:01:58,299 --> 00:02:01,072
must be smarter, more informed.

36
00:02:01,212 --> 00:02:03,621
It's a sad staple of modern culture, you know,

37
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,917
the old "Relax, turn on the TV, keep going into debt,

38
00:02:07,058 --> 00:02:09,435
and pump out a bunch of kids while you're at it,"

39
00:02:09,574 --> 00:02:12,719
but most importantly, keep showing up at those jobs

40
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,617
which you have likely already fooled yourself into believing

41
00:02:15,757 --> 00:02:18,206
serve some legitimate social role.

42
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:22,144
Remember, the 1% of the world that owns 40% of the planet's wealth

43
00:02:22,283 --> 00:02:26,944
did not get that way with you understanding how the world really works.

44
00:02:27,085 --> 00:02:30,743
Nevertheless, and such cynicism aside (I'm sorry),

45
00:02:30,883 --> 00:02:33,223
I decided that I needed to start again,

46
00:02:33,364 --> 00:02:35,676
if you will, and ask some fundamental questions

47
00:02:35,816 --> 00:02:38,750
about stuff most have simply written off and forgotten.

48
00:02:38,889 --> 00:02:42,458
If you were to take a poll today of our species, asking what truly are

49
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:46,769
the most fundamental questions that pertain to human survival and prosperity,

50
00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:51,004
such as, I don't know, what really supports human life, how food grows,

51
00:02:51,145 --> 00:02:55,319
what energy is, what creates and reinforces good public health,

52
00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:59,973
what defines a useful or detrimental belief system,

53
00:03:00,544 --> 00:03:04,848
you can rest assured, that the vast majority would have more concrete answers

54
00:03:04,987 --> 00:03:11,865
about baseball statistics, fashion trends, sitcom plots, and religious scriptures.

55
00:03:12,911 --> 00:03:16,403
Not to demean the cultural pleasures and creativity of expression

56
00:03:16,544 --> 00:03:18,562
that creates enjoyment in this life,

57
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:22,742
but we have a distortion of priority that has proven incredibly detrimental

58
00:03:22,883 --> 00:03:25,611
to the future of our sustainability on this planet,

59
00:03:25,751 --> 00:03:28,597
where the majority facing clear mounting problems

60
00:03:28,736 --> 00:03:32,859
not only doesn't understand what the root of such problems really are,

61
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,069
they don't even know what questions to ask;

62
00:03:36,942 --> 00:03:40,475
and today, there is no greater destructive ignorance at hand,

63
00:03:40,616 --> 00:03:45,394
than the vastly delusional concept known as modern economics.

64
00:03:45,533 --> 00:03:50,456
It is in this fundamental context that I found the most interest.

65
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:53,336
What is an economy?

66
00:03:53,475 --> 00:03:56,469
Where does its foundational premise come from?

67
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:59,915
What are we relating to exactly?

68
00:04:00,055 --> 00:04:04,692
How is societal organization finding a benchmark for itself?

69
00:04:04,831 --> 00:04:07,281
Is there a benchmark? What are we doing?

70
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,688
Why does the discussion of this subject appear to be so elitist

71
00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:15,240
in its vocabulary and orientation? Is it really that complicated?

72
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:19,669
I became so tired of being called ignorant of the subject

73
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:22,750
by self-proclaimed experts I've challenged,

74
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:25,740
I decided to take it upon myself to read the entire

75
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:28,954
macro-economics curriculum of Harvard University

76
00:04:29,093 --> 00:04:31,423
from the undergraduate to the PhD level,

77
00:04:31,564 --> 00:04:35,547
along with all the staples of influence: F.A. Hayek, John Maynard Keynes,

78
00:04:35,687 --> 00:04:39,632
Ludwig von Mises; and I'll tell you what, I'm really glad I did

79
00:04:39,771 --> 00:04:43,728
because I had some very poor judgments that needed correction,

80
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:47,379
not so much regarding my views about economics,

81
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:50,543
but that life is short, and I wasted an enormous,

82
00:04:50,684 --> 00:04:54,045
unforgivable amount of time reading this outdated,

83
00:04:54,185 --> 00:04:56,572
overly-intellectualized gibberish.

84
00:04:56,711 --> 00:04:59,301
[Glass Breaking] Ah, shit!

85
00:04:59,442 --> 00:05:03,170
Bob, would you take care of that please? The fuse panel.

86
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:06,728
Be careful man, it's not... [Explosion][Bob screaming]

87
00:05:07,754 --> 00:05:10,033
As the following episode will detail,

88
00:05:10,173 --> 00:05:13,177
modern economics is not true economics at all.

89
00:05:13,317 --> 00:05:18,322
It's a mere ideological philosophy, built upon a series of presuppositions

90
00:05:18,461 --> 00:05:21,592
that have been given the illusion of permanence.

91
00:05:21,733 --> 00:05:25,559
There is absolutely no relationship to the scientific integrity

92
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:28,633
of our knowledge of the environment built into this model.

93
00:05:28,773 --> 00:05:31,434
The monetary-market system of religious belief

94
00:05:31,574 --> 00:05:35,227
is at the core of the vast majority of ecological and social imbalance

95
00:05:35,367 --> 00:05:37,225
we see in the world today.

96
00:05:37,365 --> 00:05:42,504
Sadly, it is in the face of normality, so many look past it.

97
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:46,165
We might begin to see that this principal notion and practice

98
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:49,112
is truly a problem in society, and to me,

99
00:05:49,252 --> 00:05:52,108
it is at the heart of a culture in decline.

100
00:06:22,733 --> 00:06:26,722
Earth: Curious little ball of rock, gas and water, isn't it?

101
00:06:26,862 --> 00:06:30,446
Hard to believe this little bubble of chemical elements floating in space,

102
00:06:30,586 --> 00:06:34,049
basically powered by the sun, could give rise to our colorful,

103
00:06:34,189 --> 00:06:37,590
yet rather troubling super-monkey species,

104
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:42,727
a species often appearing pretty serious in its interest to destroy its habitat,

105
00:06:42,867 --> 00:06:46,563
though I should say pretty serious in its interest to destroy itself.

106
00:06:47,117 --> 00:06:49,341
- What is democracy?

107
00:06:50,048 --> 00:06:53,590
- It's got something to do with young men killing each other, I believe.

108
00:06:56,396 --> 00:06:59,064
- Excuse me a second. Bob, what the hell was that?

109
00:06:59,204 --> 00:07:03,000
The cut away, it wasn't funny. It was just depressing.

110
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:06,627
Couldn't you find some guy shooting a bottle rocket out of his ass or something?

111
00:07:09,588 --> 00:07:13,252
You know what our demographic is and the point of the show, right?

112
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,737
Okay, well please.

113
00:07:15,877 --> 00:07:18,922
Anyway, perhaps our immaturity is just a phase,

114
00:07:19,062 --> 00:07:21,502
a tragically comedic rite of passage,

115
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:23,982
no different than children that need to be burned

116
00:07:24,122 --> 00:07:27,055
by a hot stove in order to realize they shouldn't touch it,

117
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:29,391
or what the physics behind it may be.

118
00:07:29,531 --> 00:07:32,333
Nevertheless, the history and characteristics of this little orb

119
00:07:32,473 --> 00:07:35,703
can be scientifically described with a good deal of accuracy:

120
00:07:35,843 --> 00:07:38,825
A couple of billion years old now, a composite of gas and dust

121
00:07:38,964 --> 00:07:42,300
that resulted mostly from a large chemical reaction long ago,

122
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,981
likely an exploding star or supernova;

123
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:49,927
and over millions of years this dust clustered into relatively big chunks of rock,

124
00:07:50,067 --> 00:07:52,517
a pronounced gravitational field emerged,

125
00:07:52,658 --> 00:07:55,461
our chemical elements were slowly reorganized,

126
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:59,347
and conditions emerged to enable water and an atmosphere,

127
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:03,471
which is what bred the first single-celled organisms;

128
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:06,243
and so went the slow process of mutation

129
00:08:06,384 --> 00:08:10,523
into the very amusing circumstance we have today: us.

130
00:08:11,487 --> 00:08:14,595
Of course, you are free to believe whatever creation story you like:

131
00:08:14,735 --> 00:08:19,078
a rib from Adam, alien cross pollination, primordial ooze.

132
00:08:19,218 --> 00:08:22,415
At the end of the day, the utility of such knowledge is quite small.

133
00:08:22,555 --> 00:08:24,903
In fact, our little monkey brains

134
00:08:25,043 --> 00:08:28,377
might never have a complete picture of something so complex.

135
00:08:28,586 --> 00:08:32,119
Yet what we do know is that the universe is governed by laws,

136
00:08:32,259 --> 00:08:35,736
not moral or religious laws, but laws that were around

137
00:08:35,876 --> 00:08:39,602
long before we ever evolved a brain to understand them.

138
00:08:39,743 --> 00:08:43,040
Laws that very clearly point out that we either adapt to them

139
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:46,407
and respect them, or we suffer the consequences.

140
00:08:46,548 --> 00:08:50,546
Such is the true face of God: the Laws of Nature.

141
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:54,417
In many ways, the history of our universe

142
00:08:54,557 --> 00:08:56,894
is the history of our understanding of it,

143
00:08:57,033 --> 00:08:59,248
and we have come a long way as a species

144
00:08:59,388 --> 00:09:03,024
with respect to how we organize our lives around these rules.

145
00:09:03,163 --> 00:09:05,639
Likely the best example of this adaptation,

146
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:09,338
or in many ways lack thereof, is how we think about economy,

147
00:09:09,479 --> 00:09:12,124
the foundation of our social survival.

148
00:09:12,264 --> 00:09:15,581
Many thousands of years ago, our super-monkey brethren

149
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,289
began to discover how to engage nature.

150
00:09:18,429 --> 00:09:21,358
We went from being completely at the mercy of the habitat,

151
00:09:21,499 --> 00:09:23,564
gathering our food with some hunting,

152
00:09:23,703 --> 00:09:27,489
living and migrating around the natural seasonal regeneration,

153
00:09:27,629 --> 00:09:31,461
to an agricultural revolution, learning how to cultivate food,

154
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,498
create ever [more] sophisticated tools to ease labor

155
00:09:34,638 --> 00:09:38,162
and in effect, learn how to mimic nature itself.

156
00:09:38,302 --> 00:09:41,984
In fact, this new awareness and ever-increasing understanding

157
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:44,985
to harness the processes of nature to our advantage

158
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:48,929
is what has led to the vast technological innovation we see today.

159
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:52,608
If nature is doing something, odds are we can understand how

160
00:09:52,748 --> 00:09:56,913
through these dynamic scientific principles, from artificial intelligence today

161
00:09:57,052 --> 00:10:00,111
which works to emulate actual neurological processes,

162
00:10:00,251 --> 00:10:03,150
to molecular engineering which uses the atomic logic

163
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:05,769
to manually recreate material objects.

164
00:10:05,908 --> 00:10:10,475
And now, ever-important blood shifting erectile dysfunction drugs,

165
00:10:10,615 --> 00:10:12,911
which if you have being watching TV recently,

166
00:10:13,051 --> 00:10:17,360
must be the most epidemic health crisis in the Western world today.

167
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,604
Since this revolution, human society became less nomadic,

168
00:10:20,744 --> 00:10:22,681
slowly merging into cities,

169
00:10:22,821 --> 00:10:25,883
and systems of labor specialization began to rise

170
00:10:26,023 --> 00:10:29,913
along with means for exchange. Barter is a common example.

171
00:10:30,053 --> 00:10:33,273
You need some eggs? Maybe give some firewood you chopped up

172
00:10:33,413 --> 00:10:35,619
in exchange for the dairy farmer's work.

173
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:40,191
Yet, such practices became cumbersome and impractical after a while;

174
00:10:40,331 --> 00:10:43,271
so the idea of using some rare fancy rocks,

175
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:47,752
like gold and silver as a medium of exchange, eased these transactions

176
00:10:47,893 --> 00:10:51,840
through a system of pricing goods in terms of their relative value.

177
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:56,276
This gave birth to what we know today as the adjustable price system

178
00:10:56,416 --> 00:11:00,075
which, through the public's aggregate patterns of exchange and production,

179
00:11:00,215 --> 00:11:02,644
creates a crude, yet semi-workable logic

180
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:06,249
where the prices of goods reflect the balance of supply and demand,

181
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:10,957
otherwise known as the market or market value. Let me explain.

182
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,453
When you stumble into the mall and buy the 85th generation

183
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:22,620
iPoop 4G mp3 colostomy-bag camera phone waffle maker,

184
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:27,437
you are creating economic signal information that is used to calculate demand,

185
00:11:27,577 --> 00:11:30,693
local and regional preferences, and other resulting data

186
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:33,949
in concert with the millions of other impulsive consumers

187
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:37,245
who, having also likely bought the 84th generation

188
00:11:37,384 --> 00:11:40,071
just two months prior for twice the price,

189
00:11:40,211 --> 00:11:43,365
creates an aggregate flow of input data and feedback

190
00:11:43,505 --> 00:11:48,159
that allows for an ostensibly rational regulation of resource allocation,

191
00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:51,649
production, distribution, labor requirements, and of course

192
00:11:51,788 --> 00:11:56,049
price consensus in the market based on perceived supply and demand,

193
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,886
not to mention the general data of how the marketing team

194
00:11:59,025 --> 00:12:01,495
can screw you over even more later on.

195
00:12:01,634 --> 00:12:04,837
This mechanism is partly what the ultimate high priest

196
00:12:04,977 --> 00:12:09,456
of our current economic religion, Adam Smith, was alluding to

197
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:13,999
with his 'invisible hand' notion of causality in the free market.

198
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:16,139
And in many ways he was on to something.

199
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:19,597
It does work in a limited context and a crude way.

200
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:24,358
In fact, in the 1920's an economist named Ludwig von Mises put forward

201
00:12:24,498 --> 00:12:28,201
the still high-standing claim that without the price mechanism

202
00:12:28,341 --> 00:12:31,835
economic calculation and rational resource allocation

203
00:12:31,975 --> 00:12:35,408
and general organization would be impossible.

204
00:12:35,548 --> 00:12:38,857
He called it 'The Economic Calculation Problem'.

205
00:12:38,998 --> 00:12:41,732
However things are much different today than they were 200 years ago

206
00:12:41,871 --> 00:12:44,250
when Adam Smith published his 'Wealth of Nations'

207
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:47,313
or when Ludwig von Mises made his criticism of central planning.

208
00:12:47,453 --> 00:12:51,035
The fact is the argument has changed. The economic debate now is

209
00:12:51,176 --> 00:12:54,591
what is actually sustainable and progressive for the human species,

210
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:57,466
not to mere mechanics of the movement of the money.

211
00:12:57,605 --> 00:13:00,222
While it is true the price system might allow

212
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:03,095
for the basic calculation of supply &amp; demand data,

213
00:13:03,235 --> 00:13:07,810
to help rationally allocate labor, preference, distribution and the like,

214
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:10,363
it ignores the real operational factors

215
00:13:10,503 --> 00:13:13,941
that relate to true, efficient earthly management

216
00:13:14,081 --> 00:13:16,504
hence the true definition of economy

217
00:13:16,644 --> 00:13:20,062
which is: optimized efficiency on all levels.

218
00:13:20,202 --> 00:13:24,707
For instance, there is no consideration for optimum resource allocation

219
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:27,107
based on the material's most efficient purpose.

220
00:13:27,248 --> 00:13:30,287
Rational allocation of resources is not rational

221
00:13:30,427 --> 00:13:34,860
if the most conducive use of those natural materials, scientifically,

222
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,511
is not directly considered and brought into comparison. [REJECTED]

223
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:41,612
There is no consideration for the organizational efficiency

224
00:13:41,751 --> 00:13:44,702
of technical production itself, and all you have to do is

225
00:13:44,842 --> 00:13:50,303
analyze the waste machine of globalization to see this insanity at work.

226
00:13:50,443 --> 00:13:54,452
There is also no consideration for regeneration needs or recycling protocols:

227
00:13:54,592 --> 00:13:59,769
a true requirement for responsible rational resource use on a finite planet,

228
00:13:59,908 --> 00:14:02,932
nor is there any true production or distribution efficiency

229
00:14:03,072 --> 00:14:05,561
in any optimized scientific sense

230
00:14:05,701 --> 00:14:09,442
as such a means is, as will be described more so in a moment,

231
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:14,775
also counter to the inherent logic of the market system itself.

232
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:18,089
These, coupled with many other serious parameters

233
00:14:18,229 --> 00:14:23,128
needed for a truly efficient economy, are simply ignored or, even worse,

234
00:14:23,268 --> 00:14:27,312
assumed to be inherent to the price mechanism's function

235
00:14:27,452 --> 00:14:29,893
when they clearly are not.

236
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:33,926
You see, the price mechanism's concept of efficiency

237
00:14:34,066 --> 00:14:37,629
translates the subjective mass interaction of consumers

238
00:14:37,769 --> 00:14:41,805
into the narrow assessments of regional demand, production and distribution.

239
00:14:41,946 --> 00:14:45,773
It has nothing to do with how or why the methods of industry are what they are.

240
00:14:45,913 --> 00:14:48,698
Such factors are left up to the whim of the producers

241
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:51,985
operating for profit alone, completely decoupling

242
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:56,738
from the natural regulation of scientific principles of sustainability.

243
00:14:56,878 --> 00:14:58,485
Aww, man!

244
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:04,100
You see, at the core of 'The Economic Calculation Problem'

245
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,672
is really the argument that we are completely irrational,

246
00:15:06,812 --> 00:15:10,860
that we can't possibly be organized in a way that is structurally efficient;

247
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,022
we are too insane, essentially.

248
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,870
Therefore, we have to have a general economic anarchy

249
00:15:16,009 --> 00:15:19,480
to organize our society and there's no other way around it.

250
00:15:20,621 --> 00:15:21,699
(*Bullshit!*)

251
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,357
Again, today is very different than it was prior, and a quick review

252
00:15:25,496 --> 00:15:28,673
of modern computer programming and systems engineering

253
00:15:28,813 --> 00:15:31,819
will tell you that not only can the algorithmic intelligence

254
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,181
of our sensory and measurement technology today,

255
00:15:35,321 --> 00:15:38,667
coupled with synergistic computer calculation,

256
00:15:38,807 --> 00:15:42,292
orient all the previously existing factors taken into account

257
00:15:42,412 --> 00:15:44,412
by the price mechanism as we know it,

258
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:48,402
the truly relevant yet missing factors for optimal efficiency

259
00:15:48,542 --> 00:15:51,667
and sustainability could be brought into the equation.

260
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:56,008
This would be the making of a true economic calculation for industry,

261
00:15:56,148 --> 00:16:00,589
not the crude truncated data put forward by price alone.

262
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:03,516
So, coming back to our household, the Earth,

263
00:16:03,657 --> 00:16:08,899
what is this thing really? It's a system, a system of symbiotic laws.

264
00:16:09,038 --> 00:16:11,497
At the core of all principles of sustainability

265
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:15,786
is recognition of the largest order system we can find, for reference.

266
00:16:15,926 --> 00:16:19,189
The price mechanism on the other... [crash]

267
00:16:19,328 --> 00:16:21,391
Bob, what was that?

268
00:16:22,547 --> 00:16:25,028
Jesus Christ, Louie!

269
00:16:25,168 --> 00:16:27,876
Bob, why didn't you tell me Louie was here already?

270
00:16:28,017 --> 00:16:30,839
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a special guest here on Culture in Decline,

271
00:16:30,979 --> 00:16:34,437
our local logic guru, Louie-the-Logic Gremlin.

272
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:39,240
Louie has a severe impatience for anything illogical, and he works to...

273
00:16:39,975 --> 00:16:42,740
OK. Bob, you've got to get the goddamn Demo-Publican back in his cage

274
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,745
or Louie is going to freak out... Oh, shit! Cut the camera!

275
00:16:50,413 --> 00:16:52,862
Sorry about that ladies and gentlemen. As I mentioned,

276
00:16:53,003 --> 00:16:56,436
Louie here gets a little frustrated when it comes to anything illogical

277
00:16:56,576 --> 00:17:00,115
and the Demo-Publican is sort of his mortal enemy.

278
00:17:00,255 --> 00:17:03,659
Anyway, Louie, since we have you here, I want to ask you a few questions.

279
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:06,069
Is the free market actually

280
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:10,500
a good basis for sustainability for the human species?

281
00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:32,285
Well, what about infinite wants and human needs?

282
00:17:32,424 --> 00:17:35,132
How do we calculate such complexity?

283
00:18:38,489 --> 00:18:40,973
Thank you very much Louie, I appreciate that.

284
00:18:41,114 --> 00:18:42,860
Well, there you have it, folks.

285
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,703
However, logic aside, opinions about our economic system range dramatically.

286
00:18:47,844 --> 00:18:51,400
So, to gain some public consensus on the issue, we now go live

287
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:54,226
to our New York 'Culture In Decline' correspondent,

288
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:57,510
Big Scotty D, who is live on Wall Street.

289
00:18:57,651 --> 00:19:01,312
Thank you, Peter. This is Scotty D, in front of the New York Stock Exchange.

290
00:19:01,451 --> 00:19:03,664
Today we're here in New York City

291
00:19:03,805 --> 00:19:07,542
just to try to talk to some people on the street and find out a little bit

292
00:19:07,682 --> 00:19:11,500
about what's going on in the world perception of economics.

293
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,553
Culture In Decline: Man On the Street

294
00:19:14,692 --> 00:19:17,216
Sir, do you want to talk about the economy?

295
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:20,389
Would you like to talk about the economy?

296
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,375
Would you like to talk about the economy?

297
00:19:26,313 --> 00:19:28,245
I really suck at this,

298
00:19:28,384 --> 00:19:31,417
but I don't think people want to talk about economy either.

299
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,384
However, there was one guy who was willing to talk to me.

300
00:19:39,523 --> 00:19:41,803
- What do you feel is the definition of economics?

301
00:19:41,943 --> 00:19:44,341
Standing here in front of Wall Street, I'm just curious.

302
00:19:44,481 --> 00:19:46,596
What do you think economics is?

303
00:19:46,736 --> 00:19:50,900
- Well, I would say that economics is, is really just

304
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,772
just based on money, the things that's going on,

305
00:19:54,913 --> 00:19:59,135
you know, from over here by Wall Street.

306
00:19:59,276 --> 00:20:05,115
It's just money that makes the system ...

307
00:20:05,255 --> 00:20:09,860
generate throughout NY city and for everybody in the world.

308
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,921
But it's just mainly a money thing, which makes the world go round.

309
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,130
I know what you are thinking. You're thinking

310
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:18,255
"What is this guy talking about?!"

311
00:20:18,395 --> 00:20:21,576
But in reality, he probably knows as much about economics

312
00:20:21,717 --> 00:20:24,631
as I know about interviewing people on the street.

313
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:26,533
And, seems like most of us

314
00:20:26,673 --> 00:20:29,299
really don't know what the economy is all about anyway.

315
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,383
Back to you, Peter. *Man On The Streets*

316
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:34,341
Is it me or have you noticed that

317
00:20:34,481 --> 00:20:37,047
there is more for sale in the world than ever before,

318
00:20:37,186 --> 00:20:40,118
and I'm not referring to goods in your local store.

319
00:20:40,259 --> 00:20:42,870
Today, the market rational is that

320
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:46,201
everything is for sale and nothing is sacred.

321
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:50,484
Need some cash? Why don't you rent out your forehead to commercial advertising?

322
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:53,413
Or better yet, why don't you buy the life insurance policy

323
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:55,860
of your elderly neighbor, and when she dies

324
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,261
you can get nice payout? Yep, it's legal!

325
00:20:59,402 --> 00:21:01,622
Or maybe it's the little things that make you happy.

326
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:04,202
So, rather than put that blow-up doll in your car

327
00:21:04,343 --> 00:21:08,000
to use the car pool lane (hehehehe),

328
00:21:09,631 --> 00:21:12,695
just buy it, like you can in Minneapolis.

329
00:21:12,835 --> 00:21:17,569
Or maybe you have an itch to slaughter that endangered black rhino in Africa.

330
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,796
Well, you can. Costs you about $150,000,

331
00:21:20,935 --> 00:21:23,320
but hey, it's there. '150,

332
00:21:23,461 --> 00:21:25,728
boy, I can't wait to eat that rhino!'

333
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:29,739
Or more seriously, maybe your kids are not excelling well in school.

334
00:21:29,878 --> 00:21:32,275
Well, the market has a solution. Pay them!

335
00:21:32,415 --> 00:21:36,441
Pay them to read and get good grades, like they do in Dallas, Texas.

336
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:40,336
But perhaps that is overkill, because by the time they hit college age

337
00:21:40,476 --> 00:21:43,734
most prestigious universities will look the other way for admission

338
00:21:43,874 --> 00:21:48,613
once a nice hefty donation is made for that new library wing.

339
00:21:48,752 --> 00:21:51,341
Want to serve your country, but are tired of all those

340
00:21:51,481 --> 00:21:54,223
pesky UN war rules and poor pay?

341
00:21:54,364 --> 00:21:57,886
Just join the growing legion of private military contractors

342
00:21:58,027 --> 00:22:01,245
who are slowly replacing the US military in general.

343
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,221
Or how about love?

344
00:22:03,361 --> 00:22:06,062
Need a date, but don't want to wade through all the fog?

345
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:09,994
Women will now go on dates with the highest bidder on some dating sites.

346
00:22:10,134 --> 00:22:12,914
Forget chatting, just fork out a couple hundred bucks

347
00:22:13,055 --> 00:22:16,326
to entice the woman of your choice to allow you to pay for her dinner.

348
00:22:16,467 --> 00:22:19,249
I am sure it will be a long lasting relationship.

349
00:22:19,388 --> 00:22:21,221
Or perhaps most important,

350
00:22:21,361 --> 00:22:24,357
does your business need a law passed to secure profits?

351
00:22:24,497 --> 00:22:27,154
Well, just hire a lobbyist to influence Congress!

352
00:22:27,295 --> 00:22:30,127
As the prior episode of Culture In Decline denoted,

353
00:22:30,267 --> 00:22:33,195
there is nothing in the political and legal spectrum

354
00:22:33,335 --> 00:22:35,355
that is not clearly for sale.

355
00:22:35,496 --> 00:22:38,784
In fact, why do you think the court system allows most offenses

356
00:22:38,923 --> 00:22:41,355
to be cleared with monetary funds?

357
00:22:41,776 --> 00:22:45,730
But even if you do something really bad and you are stuck in jail

358
00:22:45,871 --> 00:22:47,903
don't fret, because in some cases

359
00:22:48,044 --> 00:22:51,610
you can about pay 80 bucks a night for a nice upgrade

360
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:55,904
to a clean quiet jail cell in a nice area of the prison.

361
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:59,848
You name it, you can buy it, and nothing is sacred.

362
00:22:59,989 --> 00:23:04,687
143 years after the passage of the 13th Amendment of the US Constitution

363
00:23:04,826 --> 00:23:09,525
and 60 years after Article 4 of the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights

364
00:23:09,664 --> 00:23:12,626
banned slavery and the slave trade worldwide,

365
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:16,020
there are today more slaves than anytime in human history,

366
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:19,989
trafficking about 30 million for various profit schemes.

367
00:23:20,451 --> 00:23:22,853
But, what about ethics, you might ask?

368
00:23:22,992 --> 00:23:25,681
Well, what about it? Ethics and morality

369
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:29,109
continue to be redefined by the economic ethos of the day,

370
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:31,989
and when a Wall Street trader makes millions of dollars

371
00:23:32,128 --> 00:23:35,971
betting against the currency and hence prosperity of another country,

372
00:23:36,111 --> 00:23:39,125
I can assure you he is sleeping like a baby at night,

373
00:23:39,265 --> 00:23:42,285
and why shouldn't he? He is simply doing what is rewarded

374
00:23:42,424 --> 00:23:45,617
and reinforced by the economic system-at-large.

375
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:47,837
The market's inherent psychology

376
00:23:47,978 --> 00:23:51,375
has nothing to do with anything except its own perpetuation.

377
00:23:51,516 --> 00:23:55,127
When you hear politicians tell you that they are invading some poor country

378
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,653
to bring freedom and democracy,

379
00:23:57,794 --> 00:24:00,807
you need to understand what those words really imply.

380
00:24:00,948 --> 00:24:03,160
The freedom they bring is market freedom,

381
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:06,859
and the democracy that they bring is the democracy of purchasing power:

382
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,240
the freedom of using money for influence,

383
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:13,999
the freedom to, in fact, restrict the freedom of others.

384
00:24:14,138 --> 00:24:16,621
However, let's get back to this technical stuff.

385
00:24:16,761 --> 00:24:19,546
Putting aside the distortion of market rationale

386
00:24:19,685 --> 00:24:21,567
that now puts everything for sale,

387
00:24:21,707 --> 00:24:24,207
putting aside the false premise that the price mechanism

388
00:24:24,346 --> 00:24:27,239
actually properly calculates the true attributes

389
00:24:27,378 --> 00:24:30,355
of a sustainable and efficient economic practice,

390
00:24:30,494 --> 00:24:33,875
and putting aside the basic value system disorder

391
00:24:34,016 --> 00:24:36,999
radiating out of the overall basis of unfolding,

392
00:24:37,138 --> 00:24:42,998
let's now take a little quiz. Welcome to modern Economics 101.

393
00:24:43,138 --> 00:24:45,423
Question 1: If you lived on a planet

394
00:24:45,563 --> 00:24:48,155
with finite resources and an expanding population,

395
00:24:48,295 --> 00:24:52,186
would you encourage an economy based on the need for growth and consumption

396
00:24:52,326 --> 00:24:54,239
to keep everything going?

397
00:24:54,378 --> 00:24:56,520
Correct answer: No.

398
00:24:56,661 --> 00:25:00,741
The fact that our economy literally requires constant consumption and growth

399
00:25:00,882 --> 00:25:03,859
to keep GDP afloat and people employed

400
00:25:03,999 --> 00:25:08,105
is the hallmark of not an economy, but an anti-economy.

401
00:25:08,804 --> 00:25:11,293
Question 2: If you were a producer

402
00:25:11,432 --> 00:25:14,440
would you make goods to be as durable and adaptable as possible

403
00:25:14,575 --> 00:25:16,575
given the finite nature of resources

404
00:25:16,709 --> 00:25:19,663
in an interest to maximize labor productivity?

405
00:25:19,804 --> 00:25:22,692
Answer: Yes. Today it's the opposite,

406
00:25:22,833 --> 00:25:26,316
and not only are all goods inferior the moment they are made

407
00:25:26,455 --> 00:25:30,622
due to the cost-efficiency needs for corporations to remain competitive,

408
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:34,999
most companies also engage in what is called planned obsolescence

409
00:25:35,138 --> 00:25:39,250
which deliberately reduces good quality to encourage repeat purchases

410
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:41,053
for more profit.

411
00:25:41,192 --> 00:25:44,580
Question 3: If you were a socio-economic planner,

412
00:25:44,721 --> 00:25:47,859
would you encourage everyone to buy one of everything,

413
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,125
hoarding that personal property, protectively,

414
00:25:51,265 --> 00:25:54,617
even though many goods are used infrequently?

415
00:25:54,757 --> 00:25:57,828
Answer: No. That would be inefficient.

416
00:25:57,969 --> 00:26:01,811
The reality that goods are only as relevant as their use would be realized

417
00:26:01,951 --> 00:26:04,375
and hence a system of shared access,

418
00:26:04,515 --> 00:26:07,269
not blind restrictive universal ownership,

419
00:26:07,409 --> 00:26:10,524
would be the most rational manner of unfolding.

420
00:26:10,663 --> 00:26:12,842
Question 4: What about incentive?

421
00:26:12,981 --> 00:26:15,254
Would you push a cut-throat, competititve environment

422
00:26:15,394 --> 00:26:18,787
where everyone it is out for themselves or their little group?

423
00:26:18,926 --> 00:26:22,107
Correct answer: No. Knowing what we know today

424
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:25,145
about the competitive mentality and how it creates abuse,

425
00:26:25,286 --> 00:26:29,308
along with the reality that collaboration and the sharing of information

426
00:26:29,449 --> 00:26:32,860
is truly the driver of progress on the social level,

427
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,734
competition would be seen as the most limiting of arrangements

428
00:26:36,875 --> 00:26:38,869
as a philosophical practice.

429
00:26:39,009 --> 00:26:42,415
Question 5: What would be the basis for reward today?

430
00:26:42,556 --> 00:26:46,074
Would you require every human to submit to each other for labor

431
00:26:46,213 --> 00:26:48,630
as to achieve the means for survival?

432
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:51,553
No. That would be crude and counter-productive,

433
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:54,078
given the state of technology.

434
00:26:54,219 --> 00:26:57,860
Modern technical capacity has the ability to increase productivity

435
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,229
beyond anything known in human history,

436
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:04,220
not to mention secure more safety and efficiency in general.

437
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:06,342
To push human labor for income

438
00:27:06,482 --> 00:27:11,232
in the face of this tool for vast improvement is just absurd.

439
00:27:12,109 --> 00:27:16,466
Final thoughts: If we were to take a step back and reflect upon

440
00:27:16,606 --> 00:27:20,489
how our human family is behaving across the world today,

441
00:27:20,628 --> 00:27:24,386
from Western materialism to Islamic extremism,

442
00:27:24,527 --> 00:27:27,447
from nuclear war to necrophilia,

443
00:27:27,586 --> 00:27:32,196
we are faced with a dark, yet extremely entertaining reality.

444
00:27:32,336 --> 00:27:35,970
The very real fact [is] that we are monkeys in the wild,

445
00:27:36,109 --> 00:27:38,365
barely out of the jungle on this planet

446
00:27:38,505 --> 00:27:40,933
in the words of the late, great George Carlin,

447
00:27:41,073 --> 00:27:43,688
inching out of the Dark Ages, in fact,

448
00:27:43,827 --> 00:27:47,999
from a period of deep fear and confusion with respect to who we are,

449
00:27:48,138 --> 00:27:51,155
what we are doing, how we relate to each other,

450
00:27:51,296 --> 00:27:54,999
not to mention how we relate to the habitat that spawned us.

451
00:27:55,138 --> 00:27:58,998
On one side of the spectrum we have a vast spectacle of human conceit:

452
00:27:59,138 --> 00:28:02,943
stubborn ignorance, so much so that if you are like me,

453
00:28:03,084 --> 00:28:05,995
sometimes you wonder why we should try at all.

454
00:28:06,134 --> 00:28:09,214
That maybe this species deserves everything it gets

455
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:11,999
and its fate as an evolutionary cul-de-sac,

456
00:28:12,138 --> 00:28:18,089
a failed genetic mutation, might be an ideal hope for this universe.

457
00:28:18,712 --> 00:28:20,723
Cynicism aside however,

458
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:25,746
it's easy to see that there is a growing change in the minority

459
00:28:25,885 --> 00:28:28,384
which will slowly become majority if we let it.

460
00:28:28,523 --> 00:28:30,753
An awakening is happening, an awakening

461
00:28:30,894 --> 00:28:34,072
where people have stopped imposing their traditional ideals

462
00:28:34,211 --> 00:28:36,835
and various ideological baggage on the world,

463
00:28:36,974 --> 00:28:39,692
and instead are starting to listen,

464
00:28:39,832 --> 00:28:43,607
listening to what the tools of our ingenuity have afforded us,

465
00:28:43,747 --> 00:28:47,020
listening to the message of nature itself.

466
00:28:47,161 --> 00:28:50,134
If there is any context which needs a serious intervention

467
00:28:50,273 --> 00:28:52,667
with respect to the natural laws that govern us,

468
00:28:52,807 --> 00:28:56,929
if there is any context where we need to simply pay attention,

469
00:28:57,068 --> 00:29:01,191
prepare to drop all of our prior assumptions and change accordingly,

470
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:03,722
it is in the economic context.

471
00:29:04,624 --> 00:29:07,528
Economics is not just some arbitrary abstraction

472
00:29:07,667 --> 00:29:09,985
for processing and distributing resources.

473
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:15,147
It is an underlying value molder that programs us into modes of behavior

474
00:29:15,288 --> 00:29:18,067
that extend into all areas of our psychology.

475
00:29:18,207 --> 00:29:22,211
It is the active global religion whether people like it or not,

476
00:29:22,351 --> 00:29:26,860
and for those of us that wish to see reason triumph over dogma,

477
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,260
we have a long, long road ahead.

478
00:29:30,785 --> 00:29:33,686
Advocates of the free-market model of economics will tell you

479
00:29:33,826 --> 00:29:37,576
that there is no other system possible to calculate society,

480
00:29:37,715 --> 00:29:40,002
that the competitive basis is the only way

481
00:29:40,143 --> 00:29:42,403
to incentivize our primitive culture.

482
00:29:42,544 --> 00:29:46,134
They will tell you that reduced economic interference of government

483
00:29:46,275 --> 00:29:50,999
is the key to preserving the true integrity of the market economy

484
00:29:51,099 --> 00:29:53,632
and also preserve our so-called liberty,

485
00:29:53,772 --> 00:29:55,918
which they say would be quickly corrupted

486
00:29:56,058 --> 00:29:58,545
as tyranny and oppression must occur

487
00:29:58,684 --> 00:30:03,865
if any type of collaborative, designed economic practice was applied.

488
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:06,700
They talk of the 'true' free market:

489
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:10,163
a utopian ideal that claims the invisible hand,

490
00:30:10,303 --> 00:30:14,267
if allowed to run without interference, would alleviate the poverty,

491
00:30:14,406 --> 00:30:17,903
deprivation, abuse, corruption, conflict and inefficiency

492
00:30:18,042 --> 00:30:20,517
so common in the world today.

493
00:30:21,284 --> 00:30:25,366
Well, as with all religions, delusion is common,

494
00:30:25,506 --> 00:30:28,700
because today the market is actually more free than ever

495
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:32,240
with the state being nothing more than a parent corporation

496
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:37,186
working to assist its commercial subsidiaries which support it.

497
00:30:37,326 --> 00:30:41,347
Everything is for sale, and no one is accountable.

498
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:46,859
All natural laws and physical realities that would comprise the basis

499
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,503
for true technical earthly efficiency

500
00:30:50,644 --> 00:30:53,299
and awareness and reasoning that, if allowed,

501
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,343
can literally transform the world into a place

502
00:30:56,482 --> 00:31:00,389
with vast abundance and prosperity never before seen,

503
00:31:00,529 --> 00:31:02,859
have been buried and dismissed,

504
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,979
only to be overshadowed by a certain kind of efficiency,

505
00:31:07,118 --> 00:31:11,586
market efficiency, an efficiency that tracks money and money alone,

506
00:31:11,726 --> 00:31:14,058
an efficiency that is literally decoupled

507
00:31:14,198 --> 00:31:17,146
from everything that supports and secures life itself,

508
00:31:17,286 --> 00:31:20,067
an efficiency that is circular in its reasoning

509
00:31:20,208 --> 00:31:24,274
as it has no recognition of the physical laws of nature,

510
00:31:24,413 --> 00:31:28,557
the laws of nature, which are, in fact, the only real true government

511
00:31:28,696 --> 00:31:32,961
and regulatory system that has or will ever exist.

512
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:36,216
But then again, who is to say it matters?

513
00:31:36,355 --> 00:31:39,615
Maybe we should all just take it in stride.

514
00:31:39,755 --> 00:31:42,862
Maybe this reality show of humankind,

515
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:46,479
this satirical tragic parody of itself, to be sure,

516
00:31:46,618 --> 00:31:50,057
doing all it knows, maybe this is the way it is

517
00:31:50,196 --> 00:31:52,859
and our brains, our genes are messed up,

518
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,565
and we are just waiting for the final laugh track

519
00:31:55,704 --> 00:32:01,001
when Spaceship Earth slams into that psychological brick wall.

520
00:32:01,662 --> 00:32:03,756
I guess time will tell.

521
00:32:03,895 --> 00:32:06,926
And until then, sit back, grab some popcorn

522
00:32:07,067 --> 00:32:10,326
and keep watching the greatest reality show of all time.

523
00:32:10,467 --> 00:32:13,449
And until next time, I am Peter Joseph,

524
00:32:13,588 --> 00:32:16,844
an agent and victim of a Culture in Decline.

525
00:33:05,656 --> 00:33:08,588
Would you like to talk about the economy?
