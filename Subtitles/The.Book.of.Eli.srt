1
00:03:58,263 --> 00:04:05,422
"The Book of Eli"

2
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,826
You hungry?

3
00:08:50,827 --> 00:08:52,166
You know you've
got to come get it,

4
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:54,429
don't play hard to get.

5
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:56,521
You will like it.

6
00:08:56,522 --> 00:08:59,241
It's cat...

7
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:02,086
There you go.

8
00:09:09,071 --> 00:09:11,864
Leave room
for breakfast.

9
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:58,240
<i>I can think of
younger days</i>

10
00:09:59,489 --> 00:10:03,728
<i>when living for my life</i>

11
00:10:04,732 --> 00:10:10,911
<i>Was everything a man
could want to do</i>

12
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:21,841
<i>I could never
see tomorrow</i>

13
00:10:21,842 --> 00:10:26,440
<i>I was never told</i>

14
00:10:26,441 --> 00:10:32,391
<i>about the sorrow</i>

15
00:10:37,489 --> 00:10:41,044
<i>How can you mend</i>

16
00:10:41,045 --> 00:10:44,897
<i>a broken heart?</i>

17
00:10:47,972 --> 00:10:50,600
<i>How can you
stop the rain</i>

18
00:10:50,601 --> 00:10:53,806
<i> from falling down?</i>

19
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:59,984
<i>How can you stop</i>

20
00:11:01,588 --> 00:11:06,415
<i>the sun from shining?</i>

21
00:11:06,463 --> 00:11:12,801
<i>What makes the
world go round?</i>

22
00:12:11,667 --> 00:12:13,611
Hello?

23
00:12:17,188 --> 00:12:19,287
Hello?

24
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,181
Please...

25
00:12:28,182 --> 00:12:29,976
don't hurt me.

26
00:12:29,977 --> 00:12:31,813
Here, take anything
you want.

27
00:12:31,814 --> 00:12:33,242
Frozen food.

28
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,256
Take it.

29
00:12:38,013 --> 00:12:40,163
- I'm not gonna hurt you.
- Yeah?

30
00:12:40,164 --> 00:12:42,303
That's what the
last guys said.

31
00:12:45,978 --> 00:12:47,394
Could you help me?

32
00:12:47,595 --> 00:12:49,197
The wheel came off.

33
00:12:49,198 --> 00:12:51,531
I can't fix it.

34
00:12:51,532 --> 00:12:54,973
Maybe if I...
if I could...

35
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:55,974
but I can't.

36
00:12:57,486 --> 00:13:01,605
The only good thing
about no soap

37
00:13:01,606 --> 00:13:05,612
Is that you can smell
hijackers a mile off.

38
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,665
I am impressed!

39
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,582
This lad...

40
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:12,466
smelled us...

41
00:13:12,467 --> 00:13:14,739
from thirty feet away!

42
00:13:16,482 --> 00:13:19,490
What does that say
about our hygiene?

43
00:13:21,126 --> 00:13:23,174
What you got there
in that pack?

44
00:13:23,475 --> 00:13:25,076
What pack?

45
00:13:25,211 --> 00:13:27,344
He's got a gun.

46
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:30,045
Well shit, it
ain't loaded.

47
00:13:30,861 --> 00:13:33,988
They never are.

48
00:13:33,989 --> 00:13:36,132
Ain't that right,
old man?

49
00:13:39,868 --> 00:13:41,554
Open the pack and
tip it out on the road,

50
00:13:41,555 --> 00:13:42,955
nice and slow.

51
00:13:45,461 --> 00:13:47,443
Can't do that.

52
00:13:50,388 --> 00:13:53,030
Take off the
fucking pack...

53
00:13:53,031 --> 00:13:55,667
and put it on
the ground...

54
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,384
or die!

55
00:14:01,158 --> 00:14:03,130
Are you listening to me?

56
00:14:03,131 --> 00:14:06,175
- I am now.
- Good.

57
00:14:06,176 --> 00:14:08,424
- Are you listening to me?
- Yeah.

58
00:14:08,425 --> 00:14:09,824
Good.

59
00:14:09,825 --> 00:14:10,929
Put that hand
on me again,

60
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,576
and you wont
get it back.

61
00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:19,373
Can you believe
this fucking guy?

62
00:14:19,947 --> 00:14:21,790
Alright, we will do
it the hard way.

63
00:14:29,896 --> 00:14:31,946
Why did you do that?

64
00:14:31,947 --> 00:14:34,221
Did you cut my
hand off?

65
00:14:38,555 --> 00:14:41,212
What are you standing
around for?

66
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,213
Kiss him!

67
00:14:43,881 --> 00:14:45,629
What did he say?

68
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,627
He's in shock.

69
00:14:49,703 --> 00:14:52,008
I think he meant
"Kill him".

70
00:15:28,131 --> 00:15:31,492
I told you you weren't
gonna get that back.

71
00:15:37,577 --> 00:15:40,592
Yeah, you did.

72
00:15:46,869 --> 00:15:49,028
Who are you?

73
00:17:14,603 --> 00:17:16,412
Where's your water?

74
00:17:16,413 --> 00:17:18,777
They have none, they
were gonna take you up,

75
00:17:18,778 --> 00:17:20,501
and then eat you.

76
00:17:20,502 --> 00:17:21,802
It's true.

77
00:17:26,901 --> 00:17:29,617
It's in the cart.

78
00:18:00,065 --> 00:18:01,769
You gonna take any?

79
00:18:02,603 --> 00:18:05,102
- Where are you going?
- West.

80
00:18:05,528 --> 00:18:08,074
- Can I come with you?
- No.

81
00:19:01,121 --> 00:19:02,778
<i>No!</i>

82
00:19:07,203 --> 00:19:10,430
<i>Woah, woah, woah...
Where are you going?</i>

83
00:19:16,604 --> 00:19:18,933
Stay on the path.

84
00:19:20,775 --> 00:19:22,413
<i>No!</i>

85
00:19:23,275 --> 00:19:27,831
Stay on the path,
it's not your concern.

86
00:19:29,895 --> 00:19:34,804
Stay on the path,
it's not your concern.

87
00:21:33,236 --> 00:21:35,887
- I don't know you.
- I'm not from around here.

88
00:21:35,888 --> 00:21:37,553
No shit. Who are you?

89
00:21:37,554 --> 00:21:38,971
I don't want any trouble.

90
00:21:41,624 --> 00:21:43,136
Okay.

91
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:49,350
- Just a customer, okay?
- Okay.

92
00:21:52,427 --> 00:21:55,230
I'm sorry I gotta
see the hands.

93
00:21:56,283 --> 00:21:58,505
I'm not one of them.

94
00:21:59,005 --> 00:22:00,988
Okay.

95
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:03,975
I'm gonna take something
out of my pack.

96
00:22:04,694 --> 00:22:06,707
Take your finger
off the trigger.

97
00:22:15,527 --> 00:22:18,945
Oh, sweet. That's
a Phantom 900, man.

98
00:22:18,946 --> 00:22:20,246
Is it?

99
00:22:20,247 --> 00:22:22,302
I haven't seen one of
those since the 90's.

100
00:22:22,303 --> 00:22:23,603
Yeah, I got it
back east.

101
00:22:23,604 --> 00:22:26,120
- Does it still work?
- Yeah, just need a charge,

102
00:22:26,121 --> 00:22:27,829
can you do that
for me? A charge.

103
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,580
I got cables.

104
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:33,351
I don't need cables,
I can charge it for you,

105
00:22:34,836 --> 00:22:36,706
if you got the coin.

106
00:22:39,769 --> 00:22:41,720
Yes I do.

107
00:22:47,615 --> 00:22:49,683
- It's American.
- Oh yeah.

108
00:22:49,684 --> 00:22:52,285
I got a whole
bunch of these.

109
00:22:52,286 --> 00:22:54,074
How about Chapstick,
got any Chapstick?

110
00:22:54,075 --> 00:22:56,167
No Chapstick.
I got cat oil.

111
00:22:56,168 --> 00:22:59,058
- Fresh cat oil.
- No, no.

112
00:22:59,059 --> 00:23:01,307
It's good, it's good for...

113
00:23:01,308 --> 00:23:02,257
works the same way.

114
00:23:02,258 --> 00:23:04,724
What about toys,
got any toys?

115
00:23:04,725 --> 00:23:07,863
No, I don't play.
Oh, I got...

116
00:23:10,696 --> 00:23:12,977
Oh yeah.
Yeah yeah.

117
00:23:15,137 --> 00:23:16,390
Okay, alright.

118
00:23:17,179 --> 00:23:19,700
I'll have this,
with these.

119
00:23:19,701 --> 00:23:21,508
Oh, absolutely,
those are yours.

120
00:23:21,509 --> 00:23:23,784
Okay, give me a
couple of hours.

121
00:23:23,785 --> 00:23:25,622
- I'll charge it up for you
- Thank you.

122
00:23:25,623 --> 00:23:28,640
You can wait over there,
across the street.

123
00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:32,208
- No, I'm good.
- Bar is about to open.

124
00:23:32,209 --> 00:23:33,407
I'll wait here.

125
00:23:33,408 --> 00:23:35,279
You dont trust
me, do you?

126
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,994
- I'll wait here.
- Alright.

127
00:24:20,032 --> 00:24:25,244
Carnie, one of the road
crews just pulled into town.

128
00:24:25,245 --> 00:24:27,495
They got something
for you.

129
00:24:27,496 --> 00:24:30,816
- Books?
- A whole pack of them.

130
00:24:31,648 --> 00:24:35,217
Tell them I wanna
see them. Right now.

131
00:24:48,411 --> 00:24:50,810
We did good.

132
00:25:00,792 --> 00:25:05,522
The one you want.
It ain't there?

133
00:25:07,075 --> 00:25:08,685
No.

134
00:25:08,686 --> 00:25:11,632
I just dont understand.
That's a shitload of books.

135
00:25:11,633 --> 00:25:14,942
You don't have
to understand.

136
00:25:15,521 --> 00:25:17,032
I understand.

137
00:25:17,033 --> 00:25:19,897
Leave that to me and
we can be friends.

138
00:25:19,898 --> 00:25:23,635
I have faith in you,
you will find it.

139
00:25:24,031 --> 00:25:26,403
Ah, wait!

140
00:25:26,404 --> 00:25:29,426
I got this too.

141
00:25:34,529 --> 00:25:38,827
Oh, now this is a treat.

142
00:25:39,811 --> 00:25:42,578
It's a schampoo.

143
00:25:44,443 --> 00:25:48,852
Go get slammed.
Get some pussy.

144
00:25:48,853 --> 00:25:52,544
On me as much as you
and your boys can stand.

145
00:25:52,545 --> 00:25:55,232
Then go back
on the road.

146
00:25:55,233 --> 00:25:57,947
Then we'll get
you your book!

147
00:25:57,948 --> 00:26:00,179
Of that I have no doubt.

148
00:26:05,531 --> 00:26:08,467
You're sending guys out
that can't even read

149
00:26:08,468 --> 00:26:10,787
to look for one book.

150
00:26:11,909 --> 00:26:14,048
No wonder they
never find anything.

151
00:26:17,136 --> 00:26:19,612
unless you'd like
to go with them.

152
00:26:25,477 --> 00:26:29,282
- What about these?
- Burn them.

153
00:26:30,601 --> 00:26:34,111
The place across the street.
They got any water?

154
00:26:37,151 --> 00:26:39,682
They have if you
can pay for it.

155
00:26:44,773 --> 00:26:49,500
Here. Smell this.

156
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:57,596
One of the road
crews found it.

157
00:26:58,354 --> 00:27:00,841
Who knows...

158
00:27:02,051 --> 00:27:06,676
Might be the last
schampoo on the planet.

159
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:11,074
And it's all yours.

160
00:27:14,329 --> 00:27:16,733
Did they find your book?

161
00:27:19,749 --> 00:27:22,030
No.

162
00:28:03,888 --> 00:28:05,459
Outlander?

163
00:28:06,712 --> 00:28:08,267
Let me see.

164
00:28:11,446 --> 00:28:14,707
- Alright, what will it be?
- Water.

165
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,425
That's the good stuff.

166
00:28:18,426 --> 00:28:20,156
I gotta eat into my
own rations to sell,

167
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:22,346
so it don't
come cheap.

168
00:28:31,178 --> 00:28:33,478
That will get you
maybe half way.

169
00:28:55,778 --> 00:28:57,464
Solara!

170
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:03,562
Get this and
get it filled.

171
00:29:06,728 --> 00:29:10,004
Wait. You need this.

172
00:29:26,467 --> 00:29:28,462
Can you please move?

173
00:29:31,851 --> 00:29:33,500
Thank you.

174
00:29:48,275 --> 00:29:50,793
That was my cat.

175
00:29:53,033 --> 00:29:55,862
Fine specimen.

176
00:29:55,863 --> 00:29:57,824
I saw you knock
him off the bar.

177
00:29:57,955 --> 00:30:00,778
No, I kinda shoo'd it,
I didnt really knock it.

178
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:02,282
You raised your
hand at him.

179
00:30:02,283 --> 00:30:04,414
Won't happen again,
I promise you.

180
00:30:04,415 --> 00:30:07,577
Hey Martz, how about
another drink?

181
00:30:08,509 --> 00:30:11,561
That cat's been coming
in here for 2 years.

182
00:30:12,234 --> 00:30:15,514
It's got more right to
be here than you.

183
00:30:16,109 --> 00:30:18,583
I don't want any trouble.

184
00:30:20,242 --> 00:30:22,886
That's too bad,
cause you...

185
00:30:29,435 --> 00:30:32,116
I know who you are.

186
00:30:32,117 --> 00:30:36,672
Murderer of innocent
travelers on the road.

187
00:30:37,073 --> 00:30:39,801
You are going to be
held in account

188
00:30:39,802 --> 00:30:42,902
for the things you've
done, do you know that?

189
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,436
It's okay.

190
00:30:53,687 --> 00:30:57,600
I'm gonna grab my things,
and walk out of here.

191
00:30:57,601 --> 00:31:00,883
- Alright, brother?
- Yeah.

192
00:31:40,851 --> 00:31:45,997
Cursed be the ground,
for our sake.

193
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:54,247
Of thorns and thistles, it
shall bring forth, for us.

194
00:31:54,548 --> 00:31:55,822
For out of the ground
we were taken

195
00:31:55,823 --> 00:31:57,998
for the dust we are.

196
00:32:00,682 --> 00:32:03,966
And to the dust
we shall return.

197
00:32:32,205 --> 00:32:33,643
Stop!

198
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:37,755
Please.

199
00:32:48,746 --> 00:32:50,402
Redridge!

200
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:52,923
Redridge.

201
00:33:06,415 --> 00:33:10,769
- And who are you?
- Nobody.

202
00:33:11,866 --> 00:33:14,047
Oh, I doubt that.

203
00:33:14,048 --> 00:33:16,798
The men you
killed in my bar.

204
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,399
They were nobody.

205
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,719
- But you now...
- He ain't got the shakes.

206
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,687
He ain't one of them.

207
00:33:23,688 --> 00:33:26,995
Good. This is a
civilized town.

208
00:33:26,996 --> 00:33:27,996
We don't eat humans.

209
00:33:30,197 --> 00:33:32,712
We don't see too many
people from before.

210
00:33:32,713 --> 00:33:34,493
Not anymore.

211
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:38,986
- Do you read?
- Every day.

212
00:33:40,749 --> 00:33:43,101
How good for you.
Me too.

213
00:33:43,102 --> 00:33:44,635
You know whats funny?

214
00:33:44,636 --> 00:33:48,178
As old as we are,
people like you and me,

215
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:49,679
we're the future.

216
00:33:50,205 --> 00:33:51,937
What do you
want with me?

217
00:33:52,463 --> 00:33:55,361
Straight to the point.

218
00:33:55,362 --> 00:33:57,478
I like that.

219
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:06,246
You're not just educated.

220
00:34:06,838 --> 00:34:09,130
I never saw anyone handle
themselves the way you did

221
00:34:09,131 --> 00:34:10,430
I dont know where
you learned it,

222
00:34:10,431 --> 00:34:13,151
but I sure as hell
could use it.

223
00:34:14,233 --> 00:34:17,910
It's a little town,
just the beginning.

224
00:34:17,911 --> 00:34:21,065
Im about to expand,
I need expert help,

225
00:34:21,066 --> 00:34:22,771
I could use
someone like you.

226
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:26,156
Thank you. But I'm
really not interested.

227
00:34:26,986 --> 00:34:28,111
People who work for
me live better than

228
00:34:28,112 --> 00:34:30,282
any worker dreamed.
Ask Redrige, here.

229
00:34:30,283 --> 00:34:32,388
Ask the boys, anyone.

230
00:34:33,082 --> 00:34:35,793
Real beds, hot food,
women.

231
00:34:38,357 --> 00:34:40,341
Clean water.

232
00:34:41,056 --> 00:34:43,533
You could do a lot
worse, my friend.

233
00:34:44,893 --> 00:34:46,151
Thank you.

234
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,887
But I got somewhere
I need to be.

235
00:34:50,316 --> 00:34:51,651
Where?

236
00:34:52,814 --> 00:34:54,105
West.

237
00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:56,375
There is nothing west.

238
00:34:56,376 --> 00:34:58,484
I've been told
different.

239
00:34:58,485 --> 00:35:00,253
By who?

240
00:35:05,209 --> 00:35:08,956
Tell you what.
Stay the night.

241
00:35:08,957 --> 00:35:10,443
Try a little of
our hospitality,

242
00:35:10,444 --> 00:35:12,110
see how you like it.

243
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,673
We'll talk again
in the morning.

244
00:35:14,674 --> 00:35:18,115
Word of advice, Walker.
It's not a choice.

245
00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:22,183
There's always
a choice.

246
00:35:25,909 --> 00:35:29,163
There'll be someone
outside your room all night.

247
00:35:29,164 --> 00:35:33,130
- If you need anything.
- I dont need anything.

248
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,998
You never know.

249
00:36:26,095 --> 00:36:29,612
This is for you. It's
water for washing

250
00:36:29,613 --> 00:36:32,117
and some food, some
special dessert too,

251
00:36:32,118 --> 00:36:34,054
compliments
of the house.

252
00:36:38,916 --> 00:36:40,160
I need you to take
this or say something,

253
00:36:40,161 --> 00:36:41,889
so I can find you.

254
00:36:54,329 --> 00:36:57,710
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

255
00:36:57,711 --> 00:36:59,046
Can I get you
anything else?

256
00:36:59,047 --> 00:37:00,649
No, I'm fine,
thank you.

257
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:03,085
You get blinded
in the war?

258
00:37:06,355 --> 00:37:08,897
I was born this way.

259
00:37:08,898 --> 00:37:10,522
I think probably I'm
lucky because I was

260
00:37:10,523 --> 00:37:12,410
already used to being
like this by the time

261
00:37:12,411 --> 00:37:14,639
it happened.

262
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,978
Well, thank you,
for the food.

263
00:37:17,979 --> 00:37:19,379
You're welcome.

264
00:37:21,565 --> 00:37:23,688
I like your perfume.

265
00:37:28,076 --> 00:37:33,555
It's just shampoo.
But thank you.

266
00:37:35,266 --> 00:37:36,681
Good night.

267
00:38:00,589 --> 00:38:02,009
I don't think he'll
change his mind

268
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:03,669
by the morning.

269
00:38:04,972 --> 00:38:07,051
He's not gonna stay.

270
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,690
He's different than
the others.

271
00:38:14,506 --> 00:38:15,793
You're not gonna be
able to make him do

272
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:18,051
what you want
him to do.

273
00:38:20,117 --> 00:38:23,020
Who said anything
about me?

274
00:38:24,901 --> 00:38:27,640
I'll send Solara.

275
00:38:30,734 --> 00:38:32,765
You can't do that.

276
00:38:32,766 --> 00:38:37,333
It's about time I got
better use out of her.

277
00:38:38,629 --> 00:38:42,539
Dont... Please.

278
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:46,436
Please, dont. Please.

279
00:39:02,133 --> 00:39:03,692
Can I come in?

280
00:39:06,357 --> 00:39:07,876
Give me a minute.

281
00:39:16,875 --> 00:39:20,449
Somebody already came
with food and water.

282
00:39:22,374 --> 00:39:24,546
I got everything
I need.

283
00:39:28,773 --> 00:39:30,641
Are you sure
about that?

284
00:39:34,499 --> 00:39:36,993
It's really
bright in here.

285
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:41,297
- I'm Solara.
- Right

286
00:39:41,298 --> 00:39:44,027
You filled my canteen
downstairs.

287
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:47,556
Yeah. You're that
Walker, right?

288
00:39:48,212 --> 00:39:49,541
Right.

289
00:39:52,794 --> 00:39:56,771
If you're worried about
paying its on the house.

290
00:39:56,772 --> 00:39:58,652
Paying for what?

291
00:40:00,409 --> 00:40:02,896
Why don't you
take a seat?

292
00:40:12,394 --> 00:40:13,709
No.

293
00:40:15,337 --> 00:40:16,975
No, I can't go.

294
00:40:18,024 --> 00:40:19,988
If I do he will
hurt my mom.

295
00:40:20,505 --> 00:40:23,271
- Who?
- Carnegie.

296
00:40:24,488 --> 00:40:28,007
- He's your father?`
- No

297
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:30,570
We belong to him
just the same.

298
00:40:30,571 --> 00:40:32,714
I'll sleep on
the floor.

299
00:40:32,715 --> 00:40:33,773
Tomorrow you can
tell him you had

300
00:40:33,774 --> 00:40:38,058
a good time. I promise,
I will be no trouble.

301
00:40:41,062 --> 00:40:42,787
Please.

302
00:40:49,135 --> 00:40:54,312
Knight to b4.

303
00:41:00,898 --> 00:41:03,112
Your move.

304
00:41:09,534 --> 00:41:14,417
- So... how old are you?
- Excuse me?

305
00:41:14,418 --> 00:41:16,325
I havent really seen
too many people

306
00:41:16,326 --> 00:41:18,912
your age come
through here before.

307
00:41:19,438 --> 00:41:23,128
Well, it's been...

308
00:41:25,986 --> 00:41:29,557
30 winters since
the flash.

309
00:41:31,754 --> 00:41:34,249
I really dont remember.

310
00:41:34,769 --> 00:41:36,737
Do you remember
what it was like?

311
00:41:37,596 --> 00:41:40,548
- In the world before.
- Yeah

312
00:41:44,094 --> 00:41:46,184
What was it like?

313
00:41:49,999 --> 00:41:52,693
People had more
than they needed.

314
00:41:54,362 --> 00:41:59,860
We had no idea what was
precious and what wasn't.

315
00:42:03,837 --> 00:42:05,613
We threw away things
that people would

316
00:42:05,614 --> 00:42:07,547
kill each other for now.

317
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:11,709
- Really?
- Yeah.

318
00:42:13,771 --> 00:42:16,149
You have a book.
Can I see it?

319
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:17,456
No, you cannot.

320
00:42:17,457 --> 00:42:19,840
I just want to
look at it.

321
00:42:19,841 --> 00:42:23,737
I can't even read, please
let me just see it.

322
00:42:24,481 --> 00:42:26,298
What is with you?
It is just a book.

323
00:42:26,299 --> 00:42:27,599
It's not just a book.

324
00:42:28,473 --> 00:42:30,259
What do you mean
it's not just a book?

325
00:42:31,174 --> 00:42:32,839
No more questions
about the book, okay?

326
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,140
No more questions.

327
00:43:00,636 --> 00:43:03,396
I got a question for you,
since you're here.

328
00:43:03,397 --> 00:43:06,558
Maybe I'll answer it,
maybe I won't.

329
00:43:07,893 --> 00:43:09,726
Where do you get
your water?

330
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:12,171
I can't tell you that.

331
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:14,021
You can't tell me
or you dont know?

332
00:43:14,022 --> 00:43:15,981
Oh, I know.

333
00:43:15,982 --> 00:43:19,518
But if you're not
talking about the book,

334
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:22,760
I'm not talking
about the water.

335
00:43:27,633 --> 00:43:29,643
Alright, I got another
question for you.

336
00:43:29,644 --> 00:43:30,944
Great.

337
00:43:30,945 --> 00:43:35,941
Yeah, there's a lot
of food there.

338
00:43:35,942 --> 00:43:37,642
More than I can eat.

339
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:41,578
Tell you what. We
can share it,

340
00:43:41,579 --> 00:43:45,830
like old people used to.

341
00:43:47,348 --> 00:43:50,522
- Okay.
- Okay?

342
00:43:54,787 --> 00:43:58,269
Wait a minute.
Sit.

343
00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:01,164
Sit down.

344
00:44:05,654 --> 00:44:08,218
Give me your hands.

345
00:44:09,059 --> 00:44:10,825
What are you doing?

346
00:44:10,826 --> 00:44:13,088
Trust me, give me
your hands.

347
00:44:17,362 --> 00:44:18,662
Close your eyes.

348
00:44:20,841 --> 00:44:23,823
Dear Lord, we thank
you for this meal.

349
00:44:23,824 --> 00:44:27,764
We thank you for
a warm bed and

350
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:29,921
roof over our head
on cold nights,

351
00:44:29,922 --> 00:44:31,222
such as this.

352
00:44:32,123 --> 00:44:36,540
- It's gone too long.
- Is this from the book?

353
00:44:38,813 --> 00:44:40,235
Close your eyes.

354
00:44:41,844 --> 00:44:46,123
We thank you for the
gift of companionship,

355
00:44:46,124 --> 00:44:48,835
in hard times
like these.

356
00:44:49,136 --> 00:44:50,436
Amen.

357
00:44:55,134 --> 00:44:56,857
Now we eat?

358
00:44:57,973 --> 00:44:59,364
Now we eat.

359
00:45:30,432 --> 00:45:31,732
Morning, Solara.

360
00:45:33,809 --> 00:45:36,687
How was your night,
did you sleep well?

361
00:45:36,688 --> 00:45:39,160
- I did what you said.
- Of course you did,

362
00:45:39,161 --> 00:45:44,417
but I said:
Did it work?

363
00:45:44,418 --> 00:45:48,947
- Is he staying?
- We didn't talk much.

364
00:45:48,948 --> 00:45:51,304
Solara, honey,
eat something.

365
00:45:54,962 --> 00:45:57,559
Mom, give me your hand.

366
00:45:59,623 --> 00:46:01,122
Close your eyes.

367
00:46:01,847 --> 00:46:03,715
Mom, trust me.

368
00:46:10,147 --> 00:46:11,920
Dear Lord.

369
00:46:13,281 --> 00:46:16,650
We thank you
for our food.

370
00:46:16,651 --> 00:46:20,975
Thank you for
my mother.

371
00:46:20,976 --> 00:46:22,860
Thank you for the
roof over our heads.

372
00:46:27,125 --> 00:46:30,191
And...

373
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:37,320
Well I guess thats
all for now.

374
00:46:37,321 --> 00:46:38,621
Amen.

375
00:46:44,633 --> 00:46:46,755
That's the word
you're looking for.

376
00:46:46,756 --> 00:46:48,056
Amen.

377
00:46:49,955 --> 00:46:52,377
That's how you stop.

378
00:46:58,561 --> 00:47:00,678
You said you
didn't talk much.

379
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:05,925
But did he do
any reading?

380
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:10,362
- I asked you a question.
- Bill, don't.

381
00:47:10,363 --> 00:47:14,125
You shut your mouth.

382
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:24,980
Stop!

383
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:28,394
You're hurting your
mother, Solara.

384
00:47:28,395 --> 00:47:32,115
He said he read
every day. Did he?

385
00:47:35,151 --> 00:47:37,556
Your mother, would
like you to talk.

386
00:47:37,557 --> 00:47:38,857
I dont know!

387
00:47:39,686 --> 00:47:40,986
I dont know.

388
00:47:46,958 --> 00:47:50,500
Yes, okay. Yes,
he was reading.

389
00:47:50,501 --> 00:47:52,199
What kind of book
was he reading?

390
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,468
I don't know, an
old leather one.

391
00:47:54,469 --> 00:47:55,769
And?

392
00:47:58,529 --> 00:48:01,261
I don't know, it had
some thing on the front.

393
00:48:01,262 --> 00:48:02,103
Tell me.

394
00:48:02,104 --> 00:48:03,591
I need you to
let her go.

395
00:48:03,592 --> 00:48:04,992
Show me!

396
00:48:18,504 --> 00:48:19,804
Redridge!

397
00:48:32,424 --> 00:48:35,030
Shit! I stayed
up all night.

398
00:48:35,031 --> 00:48:37,423
Where is he?

399
00:48:37,424 --> 00:48:39,625
I dont...

400
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:45,816
I just want to
make sure...

401
00:48:45,817 --> 00:48:47,798
...there's no
acid in there.

402
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:50,441
Doesn't matter, just
take these off.

403
00:48:50,441 --> 00:48:52,169
- Take them off.
- Let me dry...

404
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:53,470
- Hey!
- Alright!

405
00:48:55,011 --> 00:48:57,784
Thank you. You can tell
them I made you do it.

406
00:48:59,137 --> 00:49:01,077
- Say it.
- You made me do it.

407
00:49:26,804 --> 00:49:28,454
Is that thing loaded?

408
00:49:28,455 --> 00:49:30,726
I don't think
it's loaded.

409
00:49:30,727 --> 00:49:33,021
Only one way
to find out.

410
00:49:33,022 --> 00:49:36,771
Look, I need
that book.

411
00:49:36,772 --> 00:49:40,629
I mean I want
the book. And you.

412
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:42,885
If you make
me choose,

413
00:49:42,886 --> 00:49:45,490
I'll kill you,
I'll take the book.

414
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:49,276
Why, why do
you want it?

415
00:49:50,747 --> 00:49:55,876
I grew up with it.
I know its power.

416
00:49:55,877 --> 00:49:58,823
And if you read it,
then so do you.

417
00:49:58,824 --> 00:50:03,136
That's why they burned
them all after the war.

418
00:50:04,830 --> 00:50:06,660
Just staying alive
is an act of faith,

419
00:50:06,661 --> 00:50:08,118
building this town
is an even bigger

420
00:50:08,119 --> 00:50:11,750
act of faith. But they
don't understand that.

421
00:50:12,169 --> 00:50:13,837
None of them do.

422
00:50:13,838 --> 00:50:17,054
And I dont have the
words to help them,

423
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:19,256
but the book does.

424
00:50:21,331 --> 00:50:24,262
And I admit...

425
00:50:24,263 --> 00:50:26,515
I've had to do things,
many many things,

426
00:50:26,516 --> 00:50:29,473
I hate to ***,
I confess that.

427
00:50:31,183 --> 00:50:34,456
But if we had
that book,

428
00:50:34,457 --> 00:50:35,457
I wouldn't have to.

429
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:42,580
Can you imagine how
different, how righteous

430
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:44,223
this little world
could be if we had

431
00:50:44,224 --> 00:50:46,231
the right words
for our faith.

432
00:50:46,232 --> 00:50:47,600
The people would truly
understand why

433
00:50:47,601 --> 00:50:48,916
they're here and what
they're doing,

434
00:50:48,917 --> 00:50:52,481
they wouldn't need any
other uglier motivations.

435
00:50:54,642 --> 00:50:56,370
It's not right to keep
that book hidden away,

436
00:50:56,371 --> 00:50:59,407
it's meant to be
shared with others.

437
00:50:59,408 --> 00:51:02,490
Meant to be spread.

438
00:51:02,491 --> 00:51:03,949
Isn't that what
you want?

439
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:07,222
Of all my heart
and soul.

440
00:51:08,132 --> 00:51:11,063
I always believed that
I'd find a place where

441
00:51:11,064 --> 00:51:16,700
this book belongs,
where it was needed.

442
00:51:18,729 --> 00:51:20,809
Well, I haven't
found it yet.

443
00:51:26,647 --> 00:51:28,811
I love this guy.

444
00:51:33,392 --> 00:51:35,342
I love this guy.

445
00:51:40,186 --> 00:51:42,341
Shoot him. Please.

446
00:52:03,264 --> 00:52:05,969
What are you
standing around for?

447
00:52:06,642 --> 00:52:09,652
Take him out,
god damn it!

448
00:54:13,343 --> 00:54:15,717
I don't like being followed.

449
00:54:16,562 --> 00:54:18,213
I wanna come with you.

450
00:54:18,214 --> 00:54:21,349
- Are you dumb?
- I hate it here.

451
00:54:23,187 --> 00:54:24,061
Then change it.

452
00:54:24,062 --> 00:54:26,380
My mother thinks I'll
be safer with you.

453
00:54:31,835 --> 00:54:34,858
I'll take you to where
we get our water.

454
00:54:34,859 --> 00:54:38,033
You can have all
that you can carry.

455
00:54:46,829 --> 00:54:49,548
I mean all that
we can carry.

456
00:54:54,317 --> 00:54:57,584
Carnegie knows about two
more springs up North.

457
00:54:57,585 --> 00:55:00,225
He says he's gonna
build more towns.

458
00:55:01,557 --> 00:55:03,773
How did he know
about this one?

459
00:55:03,774 --> 00:55:07,405
He's been here.
When he was young.

460
00:55:08,826 --> 00:55:11,381
In the world before.

461
00:55:11,382 --> 00:55:14,604
I guess everyone else
who knew about it died.

462
00:55:17,062 --> 00:55:19,171
We really better hurry.

463
00:55:23,827 --> 00:55:25,471
I think I left my
glasses inside.

464
00:55:25,472 --> 00:55:28,111
can you take a
look for me?

465
00:55:34,922 --> 00:55:36,273
What are you doing?

466
00:55:39,562 --> 00:55:41,866
You are such a liar.

467
00:55:45,217 --> 00:55:46,446
I'm not a liar.

468
00:55:46,447 --> 00:55:47,558
You said I could
come with you,

469
00:55:47,559 --> 00:55:49,296
if you got your water.

470
00:55:49,297 --> 00:55:52,146
I didn't say that,
you said that.

471
00:55:52,147 --> 00:55:54,657
Besides, the road's
no place for you.

472
00:55:55,122 --> 00:55:57,214
Much worse than
you think.

473
00:55:58,410 --> 00:55:59,662
Good bye, Solara.

474
00:55:59,663 --> 00:56:00,950
Nice knowing you,
I mean that.

475
00:56:00,951 --> 00:56:03,952
- Hey.
- Yeah?

476
00:56:03,953 --> 00:56:05,253
Fuck you!

477
00:56:20,803 --> 00:56:22,850
You washed your
filthy fucking hands?

478
00:56:22,851 --> 00:56:26,382
Twice, Sir.
With your soap.

479
00:56:29,479 --> 00:56:32,129
Put a crew together,
we're going after them.

480
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:37,332
- For a fucking book.
- It's not a fucking book!

481
00:56:37,333 --> 00:56:39,665
It's a weapon!

482
00:56:40,473 --> 00:56:43,185
A weapon that aims
right at the hearts

483
00:56:43,186 --> 00:56:45,085
and minds of the
weak and desperate.

484
00:56:45,086 --> 00:56:48,625
It will give us
control of them!

485
00:56:49,019 --> 00:56:52,961
If we wanna rule more
than one fucking town

486
00:56:52,962 --> 00:56:55,436
we have to have it.

487
00:56:55,437 --> 00:56:57,435
People will come from
all over and do exactly

488
00:56:57,436 --> 00:57:03,322
what I tell them if the
words are from the book.

489
00:57:06,066 --> 00:57:10,609
It's happened before,
and it will happen again.

490
00:57:10,610 --> 00:57:13,491
All we need is that book.

491
00:57:27,443 --> 00:57:29,730
Then I want Solara.

492
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:37,225
Are you bargaining
with me?

493
00:57:37,999 --> 00:57:40,766
Is this a deal
we're making?

494
00:57:42,589 --> 00:57:44,990
We lost a lot of men.

495
00:57:44,991 --> 00:57:47,534
You need me
more than ever.

496
00:57:48,285 --> 00:57:51,322
Now you say that book
is worth the trouble.

497
00:57:51,323 --> 00:57:54,641
Well I believe you.

498
00:57:54,642 --> 00:57:57,450
But I want Solara for it.

499
00:58:10,131 --> 00:58:12,965
Why not?
Why not.

500
00:58:13,924 --> 00:58:16,541
Let's get the
fuck out of here.

501
00:58:50,132 --> 00:58:51,915
Which way are
we heading?

502
00:58:52,817 --> 00:58:54,117
West.

503
00:59:33,533 --> 00:59:34,833
Hello?

504
00:59:35,930 --> 00:59:38,451
Can anyone help me?

505
00:59:39,603 --> 00:59:42,490
Hello, is anybody there?

506
00:59:51,265 --> 00:59:52,888
Are you okay?

507
00:59:54,956 --> 00:59:57,209
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

508
00:59:57,210 --> 01:00:00,088
You go along,
I'll be okay.

509
01:00:00,089 --> 01:00:02,276
- Let me just...
- No! Really, please!

510
01:00:02,277 --> 01:00:06,301
I'm fine, really. I need
a man to help me...

511
01:00:06,302 --> 01:00:08,822
You just go along.

512
01:00:08,823 --> 01:00:10,423
It's okay, it will just
take a minute.

513
01:00:10,424 --> 01:00:13,881
I'm fine. Please...

514
01:00:37,117 --> 01:00:38,439
Help!

515
01:00:45,806 --> 01:00:47,922
Get off me!

516
01:02:57,021 --> 01:02:58,919
Hold them there.

517
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:11,010
- What's wrong?
- Did you hear that?

518
01:03:19,615 --> 01:03:20,867
Don't move.

519
01:03:37,021 --> 01:03:40,747
Take the wire off
of that. Spool it up.

520
01:03:41,767 --> 01:03:43,942
- What is that?
- Dinner.

521
01:04:03,708 --> 01:04:06,377
It's like if he's
protected somehow.

522
01:04:07,109 --> 01:04:07,378
Like there's nothing
that can touch him.

523
01:04:11,649 --> 01:04:13,966
He's just a fucking man.

524
01:04:15,715 --> 01:04:18,286
You put a bullet in him
and he will go down.

525
01:04:24,302 --> 01:04:25,674
Still warm.

526
01:04:29,135 --> 01:04:31,582
No more than a
few hours dead.

527
01:04:35,304 --> 01:04:37,078
He can't be far.

528
01:04:44,109 --> 01:04:46,835
Son of a bitch.

529
01:04:49,255 --> 01:04:51,213
Solara.

530
01:04:51,935 --> 01:04:54,515
You sure you
still want her?

531
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:00,345
It's gonna be
dark soon.

532
01:05:00,346 --> 01:05:01,160
We can't track
them at night,

533
01:05:01,161 --> 01:05:02,461
they'll see us coming.

534
01:05:03,775 --> 01:05:07,767
We'll drive right past
them and never know it.

535
01:05:07,768 --> 01:05:08,768
He's right.

536
01:05:09,230 --> 01:05:13,590
They're on foot. Tired.
They'll have to sleep.

537
01:05:15,279 --> 01:05:17,330
We'll make up the
ground tomorrow.

538
01:05:17,331 --> 01:05:19,474
We'll have them
before morning, Sam.

539
01:05:20,964 --> 01:05:24,122
That better be
a guarantee.

540
01:05:40,488 --> 01:05:43,350
Do you really read the
same book every day?

541
01:05:43,351 --> 01:05:44,651
Without fail.

542
01:05:48,818 --> 01:05:50,953
Will you read
some to me?

543
01:05:53,552 --> 01:05:54,852
Please.

544
01:06:00,162 --> 01:06:07,132
The lord is my shepard.
I shall not want;

545
01:06:07,133 --> 01:06:12,453
He makes me to lie down
in green pastures.

546
01:06:12,454 --> 01:06:15,742
He leads me beside
still waters;

547
01:06:15,743 --> 01:06:19,516
He restores my soul.

548
01:06:19,517 --> 01:06:22,623
He leadeth me in paths
of righteousness

549
01:06:22,624 --> 01:06:23,924
for His name's sake.

550
01:06:27,979 --> 01:06:29,228
Even though I walk
through the valley

551
01:06:29,229 --> 01:06:31,801
of the shadow
of death,

552
01:06:31,802 --> 01:06:34,828
I will fear no evil;

553
01:06:34,829 --> 01:06:35,829
for Thou art with me

554
01:06:37,396 --> 01:06:40,411
- That's beautiful.
- You like that?

555
01:06:40,412 --> 01:06:43,660
- Did you write that?
- Yes I did.

556
01:06:43,661 --> 01:06:47,046
- Really?
- No.

557
01:06:48,599 --> 01:06:50,454
That was around
a long time before

558
01:06:50,455 --> 01:06:53,086
you and I got here,
thats for sure.

559
01:06:58,592 --> 01:07:00,152
What did you mean
when you said it's

560
01:07:00,153 --> 01:07:01,453
not just any book?

561
01:07:12,206 --> 01:07:13,506
It's the only one.

562
01:07:16,221 --> 01:07:17,722
Really?

563
01:07:17,723 --> 01:07:19,563
After the war people
made it their business

564
01:07:19,564 --> 01:07:23,850
to find and destroy any
that the fires didn't get,

565
01:07:23,851 --> 01:07:24,938
some people say this
was the reason

566
01:07:24,939 --> 01:07:26,490
for the war in
the first place.

567
01:07:29,014 --> 01:07:33,412
Anyway, it's the only
one that survived.

568
01:07:35,670 --> 01:07:37,643
How did you get it?

569
01:07:42,770 --> 01:07:47,361
They said that the war,
tore a hole in the sky.

570
01:07:47,362 --> 01:07:48,947
You probably
heard the stories.

571
01:07:48,948 --> 01:07:49,948
Yeah.

572
01:07:50,631 --> 01:07:54,926
Tore a hole in the sky,
sun came down,

573
01:07:54,927 --> 01:07:56,427
and burned everything.

574
01:07:56,993 --> 01:07:59,314
Everything and
everybody.

575
01:07:59,715 --> 01:08:01,822
You were lucky, to
hole up and hide in

576
01:08:01,823 --> 01:08:04,871
a place like this,
or underground.

577
01:08:06,798 --> 01:08:08,818
Most people
weren't lucky.

578
01:08:12,210 --> 01:08:16,252
So, a year later we
started coming out,

579
01:08:16,253 --> 01:08:19,866
wandering around,
didn't know what to do,

580
01:08:19,867 --> 01:08:23,801
just trying to find a
place to survive.

581
01:08:24,342 --> 01:08:29,332
One day, I heard a voice.
It's hard to explain,

582
01:08:29,333 --> 01:08:35,139
but it was like if it was
coming from inside me.

583
01:08:35,140 --> 01:08:39,956
But I could hear it as
clear as I can hear you.

584
01:08:39,957 --> 01:08:42,349
What did the voice say?

585
01:08:42,350 --> 01:08:47,745
It led me. To a place
where I found the book.

586
01:08:47,746 --> 01:08:50,838
Buried, under some rubble.

587
01:08:53,776 --> 01:08:58,895
The voice told me to
carry the book out West.

588
01:08:58,896 --> 01:09:02,613
It told me a path had
been laid out for me,

589
01:09:02,614 --> 01:09:06,417
that I'd be led to a
place where the book

590
01:09:06,418 --> 01:09:07,718
would be safe.

591
01:09:11,084 --> 01:09:14,513
Told me that I'd
be protected,

592
01:09:14,514 --> 01:09:20,246
against anything that
stood in my path.

593
01:09:21,156 --> 01:09:23,680
I've been walking
ever since.

594
01:09:25,151 --> 01:09:26,294
And you did all that
because a voice

595
01:09:26,295 --> 01:09:28,430
in your head told
you to.

596
01:09:29,693 --> 01:09:31,443
Yes, I did.

597
01:09:31,713 --> 01:09:36,507
I know what I heard.
I know what I hear.

598
01:09:37,509 --> 01:09:40,816
And I know I would
have never made it,

599
01:09:40,817 --> 01:09:42,715
without help.

600
01:09:43,198 --> 01:09:46,164
- What's that?
- One question too many.

601
01:09:46,165 --> 01:09:48,685
Go to bed, we've got an
early start in the morning.

602
01:10:51,577 --> 01:10:53,507
What are you doing?

603
01:10:53,508 --> 01:10:54,981
I'm sorry, I thought
you were sleeping.

604
01:10:54,982 --> 01:10:58,643
I wasn't sleeping.
What are you doing?

605
01:10:58,644 --> 01:11:00,173
I just wanted to
see the book.

606
01:11:00,174 --> 01:11:03,775
Nobody touches it but
me, you understand?

607
01:11:03,776 --> 01:11:07,997
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, I understand.

608
01:11:18,058 --> 01:11:19,379
since you don't know
how to read anyway,

609
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:21,076
it's of no use to you.

610
01:11:21,077 --> 01:11:22,377
Yeah.

611
01:11:23,358 --> 01:11:25,385
So teach me.

612
01:11:45,018 --> 01:11:47,328
Hold on. Hold up.
Stop!

613
01:11:53,296 --> 01:11:56,265
You say you've been
walking for 30 years.

614
01:11:57,022 --> 01:11:58,799
Have you ever thought
maybe you were lost?

615
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:00,100
No.

616
01:12:00,101 --> 01:12:02,376
How do you know you're
walking in the right direction?

617
01:12:02,377 --> 01:12:04,994
I walk by faith,
not by sight.

618
01:12:06,049 --> 01:12:08,579
- What does that mean?
- It means you know something,

619
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:10,915
even if you don't
know something.

620
01:12:10,916 --> 01:12:12,044
It doesn't make
any sense.

621
01:12:12,045 --> 01:12:14,832
It doesn't have to
make sense. It's faith.

622
01:12:14,833 --> 01:12:17,418
Its a flower of light,
in a field of darkness,

623
01:12:17,419 --> 01:12:19,621
giving me the strength
to carry on, understand?

624
01:12:19,622 --> 01:12:21,117
Is that from
your book?

625
01:12:21,118 --> 01:12:25,719
No, it's Johnny Cash...

626
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:27,020
What?

627
01:12:49,403 --> 01:12:51,644
Do you think anyone
lives there?

628
01:12:51,645 --> 01:12:52,945
I dont know.

629
01:12:54,375 --> 01:12:56,240
Maybe there's water.

630
01:13:06,086 --> 01:13:07,645
Stay behind me.

631
01:13:10,125 --> 01:13:12,787
"No Trespassers"

632
01:13:12,788 --> 01:13:14,775
This is weird.

633
01:13:49,505 --> 01:13:50,700
Who are you?

634
01:13:54,782 --> 01:13:57,529
Travelers, thats all.
Don't mean any harm.

635
01:13:57,530 --> 01:14:00,845
No trespassing. Didn't
you read the sign?

636
01:14:00,846 --> 01:14:03,296
We're very sorry,
I didn't see it.

637
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:05,647
- What's your business?
- We were just...

638
01:14:05,648 --> 01:14:07,708
No business.

639
01:14:07,709 --> 01:14:09,842
We're very sorry,
and if you let us,

640
01:14:09,843 --> 01:14:11,713
we'll be on our way.

641
01:14:11,714 --> 01:14:13,622
George, look at them.

642
01:14:13,623 --> 01:14:15,890
One of them is
just a girl.

643
01:14:15,891 --> 01:14:19,187
Old story. Heard it a
hundred times before.

644
01:14:19,188 --> 01:14:21,139
We get so few
visitors these days,

645
01:14:21,140 --> 01:14:23,798
George is suspicious
of everybody.

646
01:14:23,799 --> 01:14:25,634
I'm Martha.

647
01:14:25,635 --> 01:14:27,979
Would you care
for some tea?

648
01:14:38,250 --> 01:14:41,901
How about some music?
It's so soothing.

649
01:14:41,902 --> 01:14:43,202
George!

650
01:14:56,047 --> 01:15:03,039
<i>You can ring my bell,
ring my bell.</i>

651
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:04,340
How do you like it?

652
01:15:10,916 --> 01:15:17,168
<i>You can ring my bell,
ring my bell.</i>

653
01:15:17,169 --> 01:15:19,936
- Is that good?
- Good, good.

654
01:15:20,537 --> 01:15:21,837
Great.

655
01:15:26,075 --> 01:15:28,024
It's amazing that you
two have survived

656
01:15:28,025 --> 01:15:29,797
out here all by
yourselves.

657
01:15:29,798 --> 01:15:33,578
Well, now. George is
something of a handyman.

658
01:15:35,381 --> 01:15:36,955
He did a lot of
work on this place,

659
01:15:36,956 --> 01:15:38,655
making it safe.

660
01:15:38,656 --> 01:15:41,438
We may be old, but
we're resilliant.

661
01:15:42,113 --> 01:15:43,801
We've had more than
a few trying to take

662
01:15:43,802 --> 01:15:46,118
this place from us,
haven't we George?

663
01:15:46,119 --> 01:15:47,845
Yes we have.

664
01:15:48,118 --> 01:15:49,992
I wanna show you
something, come on.

665
01:15:49,993 --> 01:15:52,904
George, no. Not now.

666
01:15:53,245 --> 01:15:54,505
Come on!

667
01:15:57,314 --> 01:15:59,836
- Are these...?
- Graves? Sure.

668
01:15:59,837 --> 01:16:02,067
It'd be uncivilized
not to bury them.

669
01:16:02,068 --> 01:16:05,240
Besides, it's good
for the soil.

670
01:16:05,241 --> 01:16:06,886
Come on back inside.

671
01:16:06,887 --> 01:16:09,123
I might be able to rustle
up some sandwhiches.

672
01:16:09,124 --> 01:16:11,280
Well, thank you. Thank
you very much.

673
01:16:11,281 --> 01:16:13,167
- We gotta go now.
- They killed these people.

674
01:16:13,168 --> 01:16:14,578
They didn't just kill
them. They ate them.

675
01:16:14,579 --> 01:16:16,525
- Their hands are shaking.
- Too much human meat.

676
01:16:16,526 --> 01:16:17,826
Let's go.

677
01:16:17,827 --> 01:16:21,028
I found some meat.
I hope you're hungry.

678
01:16:21,029 --> 01:16:22,557
No. No, thank you.

679
01:16:22,558 --> 01:16:26,343
- Well, we gotta be going.
- So soon?

680
01:16:26,344 --> 01:16:27,842
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

681
01:16:27,843 --> 01:16:29,222
Are you sure you
won't stay?

682
01:16:29,223 --> 01:16:32,410
I'm sure. Very sure.
Put the gun down.

683
01:16:32,411 --> 01:16:35,315
Sorry. Take this. Open
the door for us, please.

684
01:16:35,882 --> 01:16:38,424
- Thank you for the tea.
- Thank you so much.

685
01:16:45,749 --> 01:16:47,160
Go back inside.

686
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:52,332
George, what's wrong?

687
01:16:52,333 --> 01:16:54,813
Whole company of armed
degenerats, thats what,

688
01:16:54,814 --> 01:16:57,233
and they led them
straight to us.

689
01:16:57,234 --> 01:16:58,782
I just set out the
good china.

690
01:16:58,783 --> 01:16:59,907
Fuck the china.

691
01:16:59,908 --> 01:17:01,395
Have you got any
more weapons?

692
01:17:01,396 --> 01:17:04,717
Weapons? I'll show
you some weapons.

693
01:17:11,553 --> 01:17:12,929
Come on.

694
01:17:12,930 --> 01:17:15,276
We know you're
in there.

695
01:17:16,370 --> 01:17:19,777
Come on out and nobody
needs to get hurt.

696
01:17:23,704 --> 01:17:25,910
I'll make it easy.

697
01:17:25,911 --> 01:17:28,896
Send out Solara
with the book.

698
01:17:28,897 --> 01:17:29,818
What are we
gonna do?

699
01:17:29,819 --> 01:17:31,616
I know what the
fuck I'm doing.

700
01:17:31,617 --> 01:17:33,207
Wait, wait.

701
01:17:38,242 --> 01:17:40,411
They ain't coming out.

702
01:18:06,135 --> 01:18:09,368
Shit! Get down!
Everybody down!

703
01:18:28,972 --> 01:18:30,900
You know that
voice you heard?

704
01:18:30,901 --> 01:18:32,550
Did he say anything
about this?

705
01:18:32,899 --> 01:18:35,262
We'll get out alive.
Both of us.

706
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:36,617
What about us?

707
01:18:37,698 --> 01:18:39,221
Didn't mention you.

708
01:18:48,581 --> 01:18:49,881
Cease fire!

709
01:18:50,703 --> 01:18:52,003
Cease fire.

710
01:19:04,224 --> 01:19:06,264
Motherfuckers!

711
01:19:11,910 --> 01:19:15,406
<i>Over on the side!
Over on the side!</i>

712
01:19:18,242 --> 01:19:19,854
Fucking bastards!

713
01:19:24,826 --> 01:19:26,251
Hold your fire!

714
01:19:26,891 --> 01:19:29,529
- What are they doing?
- Nothing good.

715
01:20:44,028 --> 01:20:45,524
Where is the book?

716
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:54,076
Check his pack.

717
01:21:12,562 --> 01:21:13,864
It ain't here.

718
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:19,924
This is your last chance.
You give it up, or

719
01:21:19,925 --> 01:21:22,334
I swear I'll bury
you out here.

720
01:21:32,689 --> 01:21:36,694
Son-of-a...
Let's try this again.

721
01:21:41,026 --> 01:21:43,187
- Carnegie!
- What!?

722
01:21:53,039 --> 01:21:57,492
Now. Where's the book?

723
01:22:01,597 --> 01:22:04,224
Give him the book.
Please.

724
01:22:08,615 --> 01:22:10,544
Don't tell him.

725
01:22:20,104 --> 01:22:23,245
It's in the house.
Back of the TV.

726
01:22:24,577 --> 01:22:28,143
- Go check the TV.
- The what?

727
01:22:28,506 --> 01:22:30,843
You gotta be fucking
shitting me. You go!

728
01:22:31,602 --> 01:22:32,902
Go!

729
01:23:08,615 --> 01:23:12,433
Ask and you
shall receive.

730
01:23:17,232 --> 01:23:19,618
God is good,
is he not?

731
01:23:20,825 --> 01:23:22,125
All the time.

732
01:23:24,475 --> 01:23:26,294
Not all the time.

733
01:23:53,521 --> 01:23:54,821
No!

734
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:45,075
You see? What
did I tell you?

735
01:24:51,431 --> 01:24:53,377
He's just a man.

736
01:24:56,593 --> 01:24:59,866
No! Leave him alone!

737
01:25:08,063 --> 01:25:10,416
Where's your
protection now?

738
01:25:11,836 --> 01:25:13,136
Hmm?

739
01:25:25,248 --> 01:25:27,048
Pray for me.

740
01:25:30,278 --> 01:25:31,578
Okay?

741
01:25:36,021 --> 01:25:37,621
I mean it.

742
01:27:04,473 --> 01:27:05,773
Shit.

743
01:27:07,259 --> 01:27:08,559
Go back!

744
01:27:52,278 --> 01:27:54,733
Come on.
Come on!

745
01:28:54,196 --> 01:28:55,621
We've got enough
fuel to make it back,

746
01:28:55,622 --> 01:28:57,298
do you want to
go after her?

747
01:28:59,373 --> 01:29:00,673
No.

748
01:30:21,537 --> 01:30:25,133
- Where are you going?
- I'm going West.

749
01:30:25,134 --> 01:30:25,934
Gotta go West.

750
01:30:28,773 --> 01:30:30,073
Hey.

751
01:30:55,286 --> 01:30:59,153
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

752
01:30:59,154 --> 01:31:00,901
This. This is
all my fault.

753
01:31:00,902 --> 01:31:02,375
- No, it's not.
- Yeah it is,

754
01:31:02,376 --> 01:31:03,418
if I didn't come with
you, none of this

755
01:31:03,419 --> 01:31:04,719
would have happened.

756
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:09,162
It's not your fault.

757
01:31:11,020 --> 01:31:12,868
Did what I had to do.

758
01:31:12,869 --> 01:31:14,569
Didn't think anything
could make you

759
01:31:14,570 --> 01:31:15,270
give up that book.

760
01:31:21,363 --> 01:31:23,136
You know, for years
I've been carrying and

761
01:31:23,137 --> 01:31:25,022
reading it every day.

762
01:31:27,543 --> 01:31:30,527
I got so caught up
with keeping it safe

763
01:31:30,528 --> 01:31:35,406
I forgot to live by
what I learned from it.

764
01:31:35,910 --> 01:31:37,822
Yeah? What's that?

765
01:31:38,898 --> 01:31:40,737
Just to...

766
01:31:43,149 --> 01:31:46,269
Do for others more than
you do for yourself.

767
01:31:48,657 --> 01:31:51,150
It's what I got
from it anyway.

768
01:32:37,906 --> 01:32:39,383
Do you smell that?

769
01:32:40,489 --> 01:32:43,907
- What?
- In the air. Salt.

770
01:32:48,449 --> 01:32:51,031
We're getting close
to the ocean.

771
01:33:49,851 --> 01:33:51,709
That is good.

772
01:33:53,617 --> 01:33:54,971
That's it.

773
01:34:27,771 --> 01:34:29,617
Get the Engineer!

774
01:36:01,438 --> 01:36:03,226
That's far enough!

775
01:36:04,191 --> 01:36:06,456
What's your
business here?

776
01:36:07,819 --> 01:36:09,711
My name is Eli.

777
01:36:10,310 --> 01:36:13,033
I have a King James
Bible in my possession.

778
01:36:13,034 --> 01:36:15,529
Remain where you are.
Don't attempt to make

779
01:36:15,530 --> 01:36:19,290
any sudden moves, or
you will be fired upon.

780
01:36:35,830 --> 01:36:39,515
Be careful with it.
Thank you.

781
01:36:45,952 --> 01:36:47,830
Careful with it.

782
01:36:57,867 --> 01:36:59,167
Wait.

783
01:37:00,385 --> 01:37:03,992
We've been doing this
for a long time now.

784
01:37:05,525 --> 01:37:09,283
- Feels like a museum.
- It's much more than that.

785
01:37:09,284 --> 01:37:12,618
This is where we're
going to start again.

786
01:37:12,619 --> 01:37:14,104
We've got a printing
press that will be

787
01:37:14,105 --> 01:37:16,532
operational quite soon.

788
01:37:16,533 --> 01:37:17,819
We're going to teach
people about the

789
01:37:17,820 --> 01:37:20,034
world they lost.

790
01:37:20,035 --> 01:37:22,556
Help them start
to rebuild it.

791
01:37:22,557 --> 01:37:24,955
Look. Shakespear.
Britannica.

792
01:37:24,956 --> 01:37:27,087
Missing only a
few volumes.

793
01:37:27,088 --> 01:37:29,417
There's a whole series
of beautiful Mozart

794
01:37:29,418 --> 01:37:33,057
and Wagner records. Still
in very pristine condition.

795
01:37:33,058 --> 01:37:36,717
But never a Bible.
Well, not until now.

796
01:37:36,718 --> 01:37:40,410
May I ask what
condition it's in?

797
01:37:41,670 --> 01:37:46,480
It's beat up. But it
will do the job.

798
01:37:46,481 --> 01:37:48,700
Do you think
I could see it?

799
01:37:48,701 --> 01:37:50,001
Yes, you may.

800
01:37:57,478 --> 01:38:00,202
- That's it. It's open.
- Good.

801
01:38:34,594 --> 01:38:35,946
Do you have anything
to write on?

802
01:38:35,947 --> 01:38:39,589
Could you get us some
writing paper, please?

803
01:38:39,590 --> 01:38:40,890
A lot of it.

804
01:38:42,722 --> 01:38:44,422
A whole lot of it.

805
01:38:44,766 --> 01:38:46,066
It can't be.

806
01:38:53,865 --> 01:38:55,813
It's impossible!

807
01:38:57,121 --> 01:38:58,735
It can't be!

808
01:39:01,595 --> 01:39:03,700
Pay close attention.

809
01:39:03,701 --> 01:39:09,134
And write down
everything I say.

810
01:39:09,985 --> 01:39:13,741
Exactly as I say it.

811
01:39:17,791 --> 01:39:24,294
The first book of Moses.
Called Genesis.

812
01:39:24,959 --> 01:39:28,846
Chapter one,
verse one:

813
01:39:32,048 --> 01:39:39,173
"In the beginning God
created the heavens

814
01:39:39,174 --> 01:39:40,574
and the earth."

815
01:39:44,818 --> 01:39:46,563
Verse two:

816
01:39:48,433 --> 01:39:57,148
"And the earth was
without form and void;

817
01:40:01,615 --> 01:40:09,166
and darkness was upon
the face of the deep.

818
01:40:11,889 --> 01:40:20,380
And the Spirit of God
was hovering

819
01:40:20,381 --> 01:40:23,479
over the face
of the waters."

820
01:40:26,529 --> 01:40:29,099
Verse three:

821
01:40:31,580 --> 01:40:44,375
"And God said, Let
there be light:

822
01:40:44,376 --> 01:40:46,538
and there was light."

823
01:40:56,955 --> 01:40:59,281
Where is Solara?

824
01:41:02,392 --> 01:41:06,732
Out there.
Her choice.

825
01:41:07,362 --> 01:41:12,268
I tried to bring her
back. She refused.

826
01:41:15,417 --> 01:41:18,198
What did you do
when she refused?

827
01:41:24,003 --> 01:41:24,880
Read it.

828
01:41:24,881 --> 01:41:26,139
What did you do
to my daughter?

829
01:41:26,140 --> 01:41:27,085
Read it!

830
01:41:27,086 --> 01:41:30,211
What did you do
to my daughter!?

831
01:41:58,206 --> 01:41:59,506
Sorry.

832
01:42:02,124 --> 01:42:05,250
It's been so long
I dont remember.

833
01:42:12,355 --> 01:42:15,791
- You have to.
- I have to? Really?

834
01:42:15,792 --> 01:42:18,251
You have to. Please.

835
01:42:21,427 --> 01:42:26,995
- Your leg.
- It doesn't hurt anymore.

836
01:42:27,726 --> 01:42:29,692
I can smell it.

837
01:42:44,291 --> 01:42:47,260
You worked so hard
for that book.

838
01:42:47,261 --> 01:42:51,973
You sacrificed so
much, so many men.

839
01:42:53,235 --> 01:42:55,364
More than you
could spare.

840
01:42:57,216 --> 01:42:59,341
Now, all those people
who were too scared

841
01:42:59,342 --> 01:43:02,266
to even say your name.
They're downstairs,

842
01:43:02,267 --> 01:43:05,537
tearing up the bar right
now, did you know that?

843
01:43:06,115 --> 01:43:09,238
And there's noone
there to stop them.

844
01:43:10,181 --> 01:43:12,820
And you are feverish.

845
01:43:14,958 --> 01:43:16,533
I can't imagine what
it must feel like to

846
01:43:16,534 --> 01:43:18,470
have what you want
so close and it might

847
01:43:18,471 --> 01:43:20,716
aswell be a million
miles away.

848
01:43:20,717 --> 01:43:22,017
Stop it!

849
01:43:25,449 --> 01:43:32,352
Are you leaving me?
Claudia?

850
01:43:33,617 --> 01:43:35,601
Claudia!?

851
01:43:38,538 --> 01:43:40,533
Claudia!

852
01:45:28,626 --> 01:45:32,449
Dear Lord. Thank you for
giving me the strength

853
01:45:32,450 --> 01:45:34,237
and the conviction to
complete the task you

854
01:45:34,238 --> 01:45:35,763
entrusted to me.

855
01:46:00,669 --> 01:46:03,781
Thank you for guiding
me straight and true,

856
01:46:03,782 --> 01:46:06,722
through the many
obstacles on my path.

857
01:46:12,340 --> 01:46:14,361
And for keeping me
resolute when all around

858
01:46:14,362 --> 01:46:16,468
seemed lost.

859
01:46:16,821 --> 01:46:18,485
Thank you for your
protection and for your

860
01:46:18,486 --> 01:46:21,283
many signs along
the way.

861
01:46:22,575 --> 01:46:25,292
Thank you for any good
that I may have done,

862
01:46:25,293 --> 01:46:28,533
I'm so sorry
about the bad.

863
01:46:29,171 --> 01:46:30,429
You don't have to
leave, you know.

864
01:46:30,430 --> 01:46:32,646
You're very welcome
to stay here.

865
01:46:32,647 --> 01:46:34,918
You'll be perfectly safe.

866
01:46:34,919 --> 01:46:36,836
Thank you.

867
01:46:36,837 --> 01:46:39,760
But this is something
that I have to do.

868
01:46:44,321 --> 01:46:46,200
Where will you go?

869
01:46:47,301 --> 01:46:48,601
Home.

870
01:46:54,622 --> 01:46:56,888
Thank you for the
friend I made.

871
01:46:56,889 --> 01:47:01,079
Please watch over her,
as you watched over me.

872
01:47:21,430 --> 01:47:25,142
Thank you for finally
allowing me to rest.

873
01:47:25,143 --> 01:47:27,275
I'm so very tired.

874
01:47:27,623 --> 01:47:31,618
But I go now to my
rest at peace.

875
01:47:31,619 --> 01:47:33,534
Knowing that I've done
right with my time

876
01:47:33,535 --> 01:47:35,602
on this earth.

877
01:47:35,603 --> 01:47:40,307
HOLY BIBLE
NEW KING JAMES VERSION

878
01:47:44,280 --> 01:47:50,251
I fought the good fight.
I finished the race.

879
01:47:52,048 --> 01:47:54,865
I kept the faith.
