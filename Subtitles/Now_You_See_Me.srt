1
00:00:33,995 --> 00:00:35,748
<i>Come in close.</i>

2
00:00:37,075 --> 00:00:38,350
<i>Closer.</i>

3
00:00:39,235 --> 00:00:42,228
<i>Because the more you think you see,</i>

4
00:00:42,315 --> 00:00:44,750
<i>the easier it'll be to fool you.</i>

5
00:00:46,395 --> 00:00:48,273
<i>Because what is seeing?</i>

6
00:00:48,395 --> 00:00:52,389
<i>You're looking, but what you're really
doing is filtering, interpreting,</i>

7
00:00:52,475 --> 00:00:54,432
<i>searching for meaning.</i>

8
00:00:56,435 --> 00:00:57,664
<i>My job?</i>

9
00:00:57,755 --> 00:01:01,749
<i>To take that most precious of gifts
you give me, your attention,</i>

10
00:01:04,635 --> 00:01:06,706
<i>and use it against you.</i>

11
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:14,071
I'm going to flip through this deck.

12
00:01:14,155 --> 00:01:15,635
And I want you to see one card.

13
00:01:15,755 --> 00:01:17,155
Not this one. That's too obvious.

14
00:01:17,555 --> 00:01:18,875
Pay close attention.

15
00:01:21,435 --> 00:01:22,755
That was too fast. I'll do it again.

16
00:01:22,835 --> 00:01:24,030
Are you ready?

17
00:01:24,115 --> 00:01:25,105
Okay.

18
00:01:27,155 --> 00:01:28,953
- Now did you see one?
- Yes.

19
00:01:29,115 --> 00:01:31,027
- Do you have one in mind?
- Yes.

20
00:01:31,235 --> 00:01:32,954
Now, do you see your card here?

21
00:01:33,595 --> 00:01:34,551
No.

22
00:01:34,635 --> 00:01:36,831
That's because you're looking too closely.

23
00:01:36,915 --> 00:01:38,952
And what have I been telling you all night?

24
00:01:39,035 --> 00:01:40,515
The closer you look...

25
00:01:40,595 --> 00:01:42,154
The less you see.

26
00:02:05,355 --> 00:02:07,790
Now look into my eyes.

27
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:10,032
And sleep. Okay.

28
00:02:13,355 --> 00:02:14,550
And...

29
00:02:15,715 --> 00:02:18,310
If you can get this bill
from me, you can have it.

30
00:02:18,515 --> 00:02:20,347
Go ahead. Take it. Get it.

31
00:02:20,555 --> 00:02:23,070
If you can say your name, you can have it.

32
00:02:26,235 --> 00:02:28,625
All right, just hang out
there, wriggle a sec.

33
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:31,105
I'm gonna take a little peek under the hood

34
00:02:31,195 --> 00:02:32,709
- of your hubby's brain.
- Oh, no, no, no.

35
00:02:32,835 --> 00:02:33,951
I'm picturing...

36
00:02:34,035 --> 00:02:36,027
- Don't tell me.
- Of course.

37
00:02:36,235 --> 00:02:38,227
Beach. Cocktails.

38
00:02:38,715 --> 00:02:39,865
Florida?

39
00:02:39,955 --> 00:02:41,435
Look, it was a business trip.

40
00:02:41,635 --> 00:02:43,627
I mean, it is a kind of business.

41
00:02:43,715 --> 00:02:46,594
Maybe the oldest business.

42
00:02:46,715 --> 00:02:47,910
You know what, honey bee, let's...

43
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:49,549
She can't move, mack.

44
00:02:49,635 --> 00:02:51,035
You're thinking of a woman's name.

45
00:02:51,235 --> 00:02:52,589
A, b, c,

46
00:02:52,675 --> 00:02:53,904
d, e, f, g,

47
00:02:53,995 --> 00:02:55,111
h, i, j...

48
00:02:55,235 --> 00:02:57,033
J? Jean. Jane. Janet.

49
00:02:57,275 --> 00:02:58,345
Who's Janet?

50
00:02:59,955 --> 00:03:01,184
You know Janet?

51
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:02,636
It's not your best friend, is it?

52
00:03:03,915 --> 00:03:05,554
- Your sister?
- No, please.

53
00:03:05,635 --> 00:03:07,866
Her sister? Oh, my God.

54
00:03:07,995 --> 00:03:10,032
You weren't away on business.

55
00:03:10,115 --> 00:03:11,834
- You were away on Janet.
- No.

56
00:03:11,955 --> 00:03:13,230
Your wife's sister!

57
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:15,914
Okay, we need to move over here,

58
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:18,510
because it seems like
she's a little bit upset right now.

59
00:03:18,595 --> 00:03:20,826
You want this to go away?

60
00:03:20,915 --> 00:03:22,554
- Yes.
- Okay, pull out your wallet.

61
00:03:23,115 --> 00:03:24,595
Come on, get it out.

62
00:03:24,675 --> 00:03:25,950
Do you shake down everybody like this?

63
00:03:26,075 --> 00:03:27,828
No, only the special few.

64
00:03:27,915 --> 00:03:29,986
What is this? Two hundred seem fair?

65
00:03:30,075 --> 00:03:32,146
You know what?
This is a big deal. Let's go $250.

66
00:03:32,235 --> 00:03:33,235
You're a stick-up artist.

67
00:03:33,315 --> 00:03:34,988
Yeah. Of course.

68
00:03:35,755 --> 00:03:38,554
Okay, and sleep!

69
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:39,989
Now, when I snap my fingers,

70
00:03:40,075 --> 00:03:41,555
you won't remember any of this.

71
00:03:41,635 --> 00:03:42,830
And you, Warren Beatty,

72
00:03:43,075 --> 00:03:45,909
every time you see or even think of Janet,

73
00:03:46,275 --> 00:03:48,710
you're gonna picture me naked.

74
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:50,034
And that's not a pretty sight.

75
00:03:50,035 --> 00:03:51,025
Yeah.

76
00:03:51,115 --> 00:03:53,266
And... you're wide awake!

77
00:03:56,355 --> 00:03:58,870
Well, we did the best we could,

78
00:03:58,955 --> 00:04:01,106
but some people
just aren't to be hypnotized.

79
00:04:01,195 --> 00:04:03,471
- I did it wrong?
- Come on, honey bee.

80
00:04:03,595 --> 00:04:05,268
- Oh, no, you did it fine.
- Let me buy you dinner.

81
00:04:05,435 --> 00:04:06,630
Look after her.

82
00:04:06,715 --> 00:04:08,434
Just have to hit an atm first.

83
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:26,191
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am the next great magician,

84
00:04:26,275 --> 00:04:28,426
and I will give $100

85
00:04:28,515 --> 00:04:30,825
to anyone who can tell me
how this trick is done.

86
00:04:31,075 --> 00:04:34,546
I have an ordinary spoon from Mel's deli,
right here in Brooklyn.

87
00:04:34,635 --> 00:04:36,069
Check it out.

88
00:04:36,155 --> 00:04:39,831
Now, everyone
please pay very, very close attention.

89
00:04:40,035 --> 00:04:43,392
Because I'm about to
bend this spoon with my mind.

90
00:04:53,635 --> 00:04:55,991
Thank you. Thank you. Pass that around.

91
00:04:56,075 --> 00:04:57,589
- What's this?
- What are you doing, man?

92
00:04:57,675 --> 00:05:00,907
Look at this! Looks like
we got a spoon and a stem.

93
00:05:00,995 --> 00:05:02,111
I've got other tricks.

94
00:05:02,195 --> 00:05:04,426
Or you could give me my 100 bucks.

95
00:05:04,515 --> 00:05:05,585
You said you would.

96
00:05:05,675 --> 00:05:06,904
Nice wallet.

97
00:05:06,995 --> 00:05:08,224
You have a very good eye, sir.

98
00:05:08,315 --> 00:05:09,305
Thanks.

99
00:05:16,475 --> 00:05:17,795
Wallet.

100
00:05:18,035 --> 00:05:20,186
My wallet. My watch!

101
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:25,945
Stop that guy!

102
00:05:26,035 --> 00:05:27,151
Stop that guy in the leather jacket!

103
00:05:27,235 --> 00:05:28,225
He's got my wallet!

104
00:05:36,675 --> 00:05:38,029
Okay, Los Angeles,

105
00:05:38,115 --> 00:05:39,788
are we ready to end this thing?

106
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:40,865
Yeah!

107
00:05:40,955 --> 00:05:42,992
When that timer hits zero,

108
00:05:43,475 --> 00:05:45,785
a tank full of flesh-eating piranhas

109
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:47,787
will fall from above.

110
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:50,595
A lady has to have handcuffs. Right, girls?

111
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:53,549
One, two, three!

112
00:06:11,195 --> 00:06:12,185
Yeah!

113
00:06:22,555 --> 00:06:24,228
Help! Stop it!

114
00:06:26,155 --> 00:06:27,908
She's serious! She can't get out!

115
00:06:30,035 --> 00:06:31,515
Go get some help!

116
00:06:32,235 --> 00:06:33,385
Help, dude!

117
00:06:34,915 --> 00:06:37,225
Get out of the way! Move! Move!

118
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:18,272
Come on! This is bullshit!

119
00:07:18,395 --> 00:07:21,593
Whoever thought of this is a sick sadist!

120
00:07:26,075 --> 00:07:27,270
Yes!

121
00:07:29,075 --> 00:07:30,634
I am your biggest fan.

122
00:07:30,755 --> 00:07:32,667
I could tell by the way
you're attacking my face right now.

123
00:07:32,755 --> 00:07:33,984
Close the door. Bad apartment building.

124
00:07:34,075 --> 00:07:35,668
- Magician, come here.
- Okay.

125
00:07:37,755 --> 00:07:39,314
- Wait, wait.
- What? What?

126
00:07:39,395 --> 00:07:40,875
How did you do that...

127
00:07:40,955 --> 00:07:42,275
The seven of diamonds
on the side of the tower?

128
00:07:42,355 --> 00:07:43,914
- Yes.
- That's a trade secret.

129
00:07:46,035 --> 00:07:48,391
I'll give you a hint. It involved
bribing the tower electrician.

130
00:07:48,475 --> 00:07:49,545
How much?

131
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:50,625
50 bucks.

132
00:07:50,915 --> 00:07:52,793
- But it's so hard.
- Oh, thank you.

133
00:07:52,915 --> 00:07:53,985
Is it always a seven?

134
00:07:54,075 --> 00:07:55,676
I could do that trick 52 different ways.

135
00:07:55,755 --> 00:07:57,633
Can you do 52 different tricks on me?

136
00:07:58,075 --> 00:07:59,145
I'll see what I can do.

137
00:07:59,435 --> 00:08:01,108
Magic man!

138
00:08:01,475 --> 00:08:02,875
I love your shampoo.

139
00:08:05,195 --> 00:08:06,424
- Hold up.
- What?

140
00:08:08,835 --> 00:08:09,871
You need to leave.

141
00:08:09,955 --> 00:08:10,945
Are you kidding me?

142
00:08:11,155 --> 00:08:13,147
Oh, my God, this is so embarrassing.

143
00:08:13,395 --> 00:08:14,385
Is this what you do?

144
00:08:14,475 --> 00:08:16,432
Some kind of sick trick you do to women?

145
00:08:16,635 --> 00:08:18,752
"45 east Evan street."

146
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,355
Don't worry about it. I'll call you.

147
00:08:20,515 --> 00:08:21,915
You don't have my number.

148
00:08:22,115 --> 00:08:24,152
I'm magic. I'll find it. Have a good night.

149
00:08:24,235 --> 00:08:25,749
You are such an asshole.

150
00:08:26,435 --> 00:08:27,585
I'm going to go with her.

151
00:08:27,755 --> 00:08:29,356
Go. I got your back. I'll be right here.

152
00:08:30,835 --> 00:08:31,871
Go ahead!

153
00:08:31,955 --> 00:08:33,469
That's on you, Fuller.

154
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:52,915
Let's go, let's go! Now, now, now!

155
00:09:03,995 --> 00:09:05,065
Daniel?

156
00:10:12,475 --> 00:10:13,511
Hey!

157
00:10:14,635 --> 00:10:15,671
Henley.

158
00:10:16,035 --> 00:10:18,072
Danny? Hey.

159
00:10:18,475 --> 00:10:20,944
You got a card, huh?

160
00:10:21,915 --> 00:10:24,146
No, no, no,
it's good for you. Congratulations.

161
00:10:24,235 --> 00:10:25,225
All right, so here's what I'm gonna do,

162
00:10:25,355 --> 00:10:26,630
I'm gonna go inside.
I'm gonna scope the place out.

163
00:10:26,715 --> 00:10:27,910
You wait out here. I will come back

164
00:10:27,995 --> 00:10:29,065
and get you, okay? Do not come in.

165
00:10:29,155 --> 00:10:30,908
Hey, Danny! I'm not your assistant anymore.

166
00:10:31,195 --> 00:10:32,515
Nice hair.

167
00:10:32,595 --> 00:10:34,314
So, actually, what have you been up to?

168
00:10:34,395 --> 00:10:36,512
I think you know exactly
what I've been up to, Danny.

169
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:39,349
I saw all your anonymous
posting on my website.

170
00:10:39,435 --> 00:10:40,754
You have a website. That's good.

171
00:10:40,755 --> 00:10:42,508
Good for you. Get the word out.

172
00:10:45,035 --> 00:10:46,469
Okay.

173
00:10:46,555 --> 00:10:49,707
So apparently none of us
was the only one chosen.

174
00:10:49,835 --> 00:10:52,430
Let me be the first one
to kick my ego to the curb.

175
00:10:52,595 --> 00:10:53,665
Yeah. Excuse me.

176
00:10:53,755 --> 00:10:55,553
- Door's locked.
- Is it? I'll check.

177
00:10:55,715 --> 00:10:58,230
You. Now, hold it, don't tell me.

178
00:10:58,355 --> 00:10:59,914
Helen? No, no.

179
00:11:00,075 --> 00:11:01,429
Henley.

180
00:11:01,515 --> 00:11:02,744
It's on your coffee cup.

181
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:04,628
Thanks for keeping me honest.

182
00:11:04,715 --> 00:11:06,229
That wasn't mentalism, by the way.

183
00:11:06,355 --> 00:11:07,436
It was just an observation.

184
00:11:07,595 --> 00:11:11,111
Second observation, you are beautiful.

185
00:11:11,555 --> 00:11:12,306
Thank you.

186
00:11:12,635 --> 00:11:15,104
That's good. That's very nice.
Very well-polished. Nice bit.

187
00:11:15,195 --> 00:11:17,471
J. Daniel atlas. Nice to meet you.

188
00:11:17,715 --> 00:11:19,354
Very nice. I know
who you are and I just want to say that

189
00:11:19,475 --> 00:11:20,431
I'm not interested in you doing

190
00:11:20,515 --> 00:11:21,665
your mentalism thing on us.

191
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:24,715
Especially when we don't know
who brought us here or even if it's real.

192
00:11:25,195 --> 00:11:29,269
Hold on, I'm sensing...
I'm sensing you are a control freak.

193
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,584
I'm sorry, have we met before?

194
00:11:30,675 --> 00:11:32,109
It doesn't take a mentalist
to figure that out.

195
00:11:32,195 --> 00:11:33,265
You are a control freak.

196
00:11:33,355 --> 00:11:35,426
Well, I take that as a compliment.

197
00:11:35,515 --> 00:11:36,915
Only he would take it as a compliment.

198
00:11:36,995 --> 00:11:38,987
Okay, great. Good. Another compliment.

199
00:11:39,075 --> 00:11:42,432
Okay. So that's why
you're no longer a couple.

200
00:11:42,515 --> 00:11:43,631
A couple? No, no.

201
00:11:43,715 --> 00:11:44,910
We were never a couple.

202
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:46,793
He used to saw me in half.

203
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:47,911
She was a very good assistant.

204
00:11:47,995 --> 00:11:49,031
But I was too fat for Danny.

205
00:11:49,115 --> 00:11:51,949
No. I said that one time
because of the trap door.

206
00:11:52,035 --> 00:11:54,027
- There were specs.
- You built it this size.

207
00:11:54,115 --> 00:11:55,714
No one could fit through there. No one.

208
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:56,865
Rebecca fit through.

209
00:11:57,035 --> 00:11:58,628
Rebecca fit for years.

210
00:11:58,715 --> 00:12:00,388
Do you know how hard it is to stay

211
00:12:00,515 --> 00:12:02,347
in those tiny little costumes?

212
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,387
No. I'm the main attraction.

213
00:12:04,675 --> 00:12:06,632
Okay. So he never made you feel special.

214
00:12:06,715 --> 00:12:10,629
And, trust me, you deserve
to be made to feel special.

215
00:12:10,715 --> 00:12:12,149
That's a really nice story.

216
00:12:12,235 --> 00:12:13,908
Hope you guys enjoy each other's company.

217
00:12:14,155 --> 00:12:15,305
No way.

218
00:12:16,475 --> 00:12:18,068
J. Daniel atlas?

219
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:20,790
Dude, I've seen everything
that you have ever done.

220
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,150
You're like...

221
00:12:22,235 --> 00:12:23,464
I idolize you. Seriously.

222
00:12:23,555 --> 00:12:25,069
From a true fan. It's so nice to meet you.

223
00:12:25,155 --> 00:12:26,669
I'm Jack, by the way.

224
00:12:26,755 --> 00:12:28,155
Question. Did you get one of these?

225
00:12:29,195 --> 00:12:30,072
Yeah. Death.

226
00:12:30,955 --> 00:12:32,105
The high priestess.

227
00:12:32,275 --> 00:12:33,470
I'm the lover.

228
00:12:33,635 --> 00:12:34,671
Three minutes.

229
00:12:35,675 --> 00:12:36,745
Hermit.

230
00:12:36,955 --> 00:12:39,595
So, what are we...
Are we waiting for someone?

231
00:12:39,795 --> 00:12:41,195
- Why are we just...
- The door's locked.

232
00:12:41,315 --> 00:12:43,830
Oh, no, nothing's ever locked.

233
00:12:53,515 --> 00:12:55,313
What is this place?

234
00:12:59,635 --> 00:13:01,274
Wow. Thought my apartment was nasty.

235
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:11,106
Man, it's freezing in here.

236
00:13:12,795 --> 00:13:13,831
What's that?

237
00:13:14,035 --> 00:13:15,230
I don't know.

238
00:13:18,515 --> 00:13:19,505
What's it say?

239
00:13:20,755 --> 00:13:22,314
"Now you don't."

240
00:13:23,115 --> 00:13:26,426
"A Rose by any other name..."

241
00:13:31,355 --> 00:13:33,551
Guys, what's happening?

242
00:13:35,235 --> 00:13:36,749
Look at that.

243
00:13:43,475 --> 00:13:44,591
It's gas!

244
00:13:44,835 --> 00:13:46,906
Relax. Just dry ice.

245
00:13:47,715 --> 00:13:48,705
Cool.

246
00:13:49,675 --> 00:13:51,155
Wait. What do you think this is all about?

247
00:13:51,235 --> 00:13:52,988
Hang on. Hang on.

248
00:13:57,835 --> 00:13:58,985
I got nothin'.

249
00:13:59,155 --> 00:14:00,908
Okay. Thank you. Thank you for the delay.

250
00:14:01,115 --> 00:14:03,107
I'm just trying to create
the space for wisdom.

251
00:14:03,195 --> 00:14:04,754
Okay, so you're like Buddha,

252
00:14:04,835 --> 00:14:06,269
if he wasn't so enlightened.

253
00:14:06,355 --> 00:14:07,709
And you're like Jesus,

254
00:14:07,795 --> 00:14:10,355
if he was arrogant
and all of his miracles were fake.

255
00:14:10,435 --> 00:14:11,710
Okay, lovebirds, get a room.

256
00:14:11,795 --> 00:14:13,627
Danny, be honest. Did you do this?

257
00:14:13,715 --> 00:14:14,831
No. Wait, did you?

258
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:16,275
I wish.

259
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:19,031
Why didn't anyone ask me if I did it?

260
00:14:20,035 --> 00:14:21,185
Oh, great.

261
00:14:26,555 --> 00:14:28,308
Electricity is out.

262
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:30,954
Well, let's check.

263
00:14:47,795 --> 00:14:49,275
Blueprints.

264
00:14:50,075 --> 00:14:51,475
They're incredible.

265
00:14:52,915 --> 00:14:54,269
Who do you think did this?

266
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,586
I don't know, but I
really want to meet them.

267
00:14:58,555 --> 00:15:00,114
It's a show.

268
00:15:19,955 --> 00:15:21,355
<i>Merritt McKinney,</i>

269
00:15:23,115 --> 00:15:24,469
<i>Daniel atlas,</i>

270
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:27,104

273
00:15:38,275 --> 00:15:40,346
<i>The four horsemen.</i>

274
00:15:41,795 --> 00:15:43,229
Thank you.

275
00:15:43,315 --> 00:15:45,466
Tonight we would like to try something

276
00:15:45,595 --> 00:15:48,110
that will, well, set us a bit apart.

277
00:15:48,195 --> 00:15:49,675
For our final trick,

278
00:15:49,795 --> 00:15:51,752
we're gonna do something never before

279
00:15:51,835 --> 00:15:53,827
seen on a Las Vegas stage.

280
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:57,185
Or any stage for that matter.

281
00:15:57,995 --> 00:15:59,827
Ladies and gentlemen,

282
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:02,865
tonight

283
00:16:03,795 --> 00:16:05,912
we are going to rob a bank.

284
00:16:16,515 --> 00:16:18,632
That's a lot of excitement for a crime.

285
00:16:19,355 --> 00:16:23,031
I'm getting excited.
What about you, people?

286
00:16:28,515 --> 00:16:30,746
One, two, three!

287
00:16:39,435 --> 00:16:41,347
Sorry, sir.
There's absolutely no recording allowed

288
00:16:41,435 --> 00:16:42,710
during the performance.

289
00:16:42,795 --> 00:16:44,787
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure, of course.

290
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:45,945
Let me just put this away.

291
00:16:46,035 --> 00:16:47,355
Actually, I need to take that.

292
00:16:47,435 --> 00:16:49,870
After the show, I can come
and give it back to you.

293
00:16:50,595 --> 00:16:51,949
Okay.

294
00:16:55,075 --> 00:16:56,794
Okay, okay.

295
00:16:57,035 --> 00:16:58,867
Now, please, please, settle down.

296
00:16:59,635 --> 00:17:02,469
Now who here has a bank
they would like us to rob?

297
00:17:03,715 --> 00:17:05,707
That's a lot of people with a vendetta.

298
00:17:05,915 --> 00:17:07,588
So we'll choose one at random then.

299
00:17:09,235 --> 00:17:11,875
My associates will make sure
it's random. Right?

300
00:17:12,675 --> 00:17:13,791
Thank you, merritt.

301
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,673
We are looking at row number 5.

302
00:17:15,755 --> 00:17:16,871
Where is that?

303
00:17:16,955 --> 00:17:19,789
And henley, could I please
have a random seat number?

304
00:17:20,675 --> 00:17:22,189
Oh. Lucky number 13.

305
00:17:22,435 --> 00:17:23,949
B-5-13. Where are you?

306
00:17:24,275 --> 00:17:27,905
Sir, please, stand up. There you are. Hi.

307
00:17:29,555 --> 00:17:31,148
Could you just confirm for me that this

308
00:17:31,235 --> 00:17:33,306
is, in fact, your seat? B-5-13.

309
00:17:33,395 --> 00:17:34,385
Yes.

310
00:17:34,475 --> 00:17:36,467
Okay. Wonderful.
Now, could you please tell us

311
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:37,995
your name and the name of your bank?

312
00:17:38,075 --> 00:17:40,306
Well, my name is Etienne Forcier.

313
00:17:40,555 --> 00:17:43,866
And my bank,
it's credit republican de Paris.

314
00:17:44,115 --> 00:17:45,265
French. Okay.

315
00:17:45,475 --> 00:17:47,034
We were hoping for something
a little more local,

316
00:17:47,115 --> 00:17:49,346
a kind of Mom-and-pop
credit union with no security.

317
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:51,472
But that's fine. A promise is a promise.

318
00:17:51,555 --> 00:17:52,830
Could you please come up to the stage

319
00:17:52,915 --> 00:17:54,144
and we'll rob your bank.

320
00:17:54,235 --> 00:17:56,352
And while he does that...

321
00:17:56,435 --> 00:17:57,755
There is someone here tonight

322
00:17:57,835 --> 00:17:59,554
without whom we would just be

323
00:17:59,675 --> 00:18:01,667
four magicians working the circuit,

324
00:18:01,755 --> 00:18:02,745
trying to get...

325
00:18:02,955 --> 00:18:04,355
Well, actually, trying to get here.

326
00:18:04,595 --> 00:18:05,711
You probably know this man,

327
00:18:05,795 --> 00:18:07,275
if not from one of the many, many

328
00:18:07,435 --> 00:18:08,664
companies he puts his name on.

329
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:10,826
He is our friend. He is our benefactor.

330
00:18:10,915 --> 00:18:12,235
Mr. Arthur Tressler.

331
00:18:12,355 --> 00:18:14,426
Please, stand up, art. Please, stand up.

332
00:18:14,515 --> 00:18:15,505
The only man here with

333
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,712
the queen's cell phone number.

334
00:18:18,275 --> 00:18:20,267
Actually, please, stay standing, art.

335
00:18:21,275 --> 00:18:23,506
I want to say that
when we came to Mr. Tressler,

336
00:18:23,595 --> 00:18:25,985
we promised that, as a unit,
we could become

337
00:18:26,115 --> 00:18:27,185
the biggest name in magic.

338
00:18:27,275 --> 00:18:28,675
So we wanted to say, "thank you."

339
00:18:28,755 --> 00:18:30,747
And by the way, art,
you notice on the sign out front,

340
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,946
we made sure we put your name on top.

341
00:18:33,115 --> 00:18:35,186
If you turn out to be as good

342
00:18:35,275 --> 00:18:37,107
as you think you are, dear girl,

343
00:18:37,275 --> 00:18:39,346
that won't be necessary much longer.

344
00:18:39,595 --> 00:18:40,870
We haven't done our closer yet.

345
00:18:40,955 --> 00:18:42,105
Why don't you watch it

346
00:18:42,195 --> 00:18:43,515
and then you can decide for yourself.

347
00:18:43,635 --> 00:18:46,070
Ladies and gentlemen, Arthur Tressler!

348
00:18:46,155 --> 00:18:47,555
Thank you. And, of course, once again,

349
00:18:47,635 --> 00:18:49,672
the cardinal of clairvoyance,
merritt McKinney.

350
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:53,107
Etienne, what Jack
is bringing to the stage now,

351
00:18:53,355 --> 00:18:56,951
is what we in the magic world
call a teleportation helmet.

352
00:18:57,115 --> 00:18:59,232
You will need to wear this,
as it will allow you

353
00:18:59,475 --> 00:19:03,230
to literally fold through space and time

354
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,626
to your bank in the...

355
00:19:05,795 --> 00:19:06,831
8th?

356
00:19:07,075 --> 00:19:08,987
- 9th arrondissement.
- Yeah.

357
00:19:09,155 --> 00:19:10,987
Now, once you are there,

358
00:19:11,075 --> 00:19:13,234
we will be able to speak
with you through this helmet.

359
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,988
Now if...

360
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,948
Oh, my God, that's beautiful.

361
00:19:17,035 --> 00:19:19,231
It has the added attraction
of being very stylish.

362
00:19:19,355 --> 00:19:23,065
It's about time the French learned
from America on that subject.

363
00:19:24,715 --> 00:19:25,831
Is that a beautiful piece of headgear?

364
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:27,508
- Thank you. Thank you...
- It is.

365
00:19:28,595 --> 00:19:31,155
Thank you. Thank you very much.

366
00:19:32,555 --> 00:19:33,875
But before you go anywhere,

367
00:19:33,995 --> 00:19:35,987
could you please, pick a card, any card.

368
00:19:36,195 --> 00:19:37,345
Not that card.

369
00:19:37,555 --> 00:19:40,832
No, that's an old American joke.
You can take that one.

370
00:19:41,035 --> 00:19:42,515
Okay. This one?

371
00:19:42,675 --> 00:19:44,715
Show it to your friends in section B.
But not to us.

372
00:19:46,355 --> 00:19:48,392
Okay, great. Now if you could
just sign your name there.

373
00:19:48,515 --> 00:19:50,950
- Yes.
- In English, if possible.

374
00:19:51,355 --> 00:19:52,755
- That's good.
- Thanks.

375
00:19:53,915 --> 00:19:55,031
Put it in your pocket.

376
00:19:55,355 --> 00:19:57,790
And now for one tiny detail.

377
00:20:15,195 --> 00:20:19,747
Now, etienne, let's step into
this cockamamie contraption.

378
00:20:19,955 --> 00:20:22,231
<i>And I'll step off of it. Bonne chance.</i>

379
00:20:22,315 --> 00:20:25,035
It's 11:50 P.M. here in Vegas.

380
00:20:25,275 --> 00:20:27,392
That's 8:50 A.M. in Paris.

381
00:20:27,555 --> 00:20:29,911
Your bank opens in less than 10 minutes.

382
00:20:30,155 --> 00:20:31,145
One,

383
00:20:31,235 --> 00:20:32,305
two...

384
00:20:32,395 --> 00:20:33,431
Three.

385
00:20:36,715 --> 00:20:37,910
What the fuck?

386
00:20:38,115 --> 00:20:39,708
- Etienne?
- Etienne?

387
00:20:39,915 --> 00:20:41,872
It wasn't supposed to happen
like that, was it?

388
00:20:41,955 --> 00:20:43,184
Etienne?

389
00:20:43,555 --> 00:20:45,547
I liked that little French guy.

390
00:20:45,795 --> 00:20:46,831
Where did he go?

391
00:20:55,795 --> 00:20:57,309
Wait, there he is.

392
00:20:59,635 --> 00:21:01,672
No, no, no, no, please, please, please.

393
00:21:01,915 --> 00:21:04,589
This is Daniel atlas. Can you hear me?

394
00:21:04,675 --> 00:21:05,904
Etienne? Are you okay?

395
00:21:05,995 --> 00:21:07,065
<i>Yes.</i>

396
00:21:07,195 --> 00:21:09,551
Perfect. What do you see in there?

397
00:21:11,515 --> 00:21:12,585
Money.

398
00:21:13,115 --> 00:21:14,231
Is this real?

399
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:16,784
Yes. Looks like three million
or so Euros' worth.

400
00:21:19,035 --> 00:21:20,594
Okay, now, here's what
we're gonna need you to do.

401
00:21:20,675 --> 00:21:22,632
<i>I want you to take the card that you signed</i>

402
00:21:22,755 --> 00:21:23,984
<i>out of your pocket.</i>

403
00:21:24,435 --> 00:21:25,505
And I want you to take the ticket stub

404
00:21:25,595 --> 00:21:26,665
from tonight's show

405
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:27,911
<i>and I want you to put it right there</i>

406
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,032
<i>in the middle of the money.</i>

407
00:21:33,115 --> 00:21:34,265
Now drop it.

408
00:21:46,355 --> 00:21:49,553
Now, on the side of your helmet
you should feel a button.

409
00:21:49,635 --> 00:21:50,955
Don't press it just yet.

410
00:21:51,075 --> 00:21:52,794
<i>That button activates an air duct</i>

411
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:55,629
that connects Paris to Las Vegas.

412
00:21:55,795 --> 00:21:57,149
<i>Okay, good. Now you can press it.</i>

413
00:21:57,355 --> 00:21:59,472
All right, now, etienne, hold on tight.

414
00:21:59,555 --> 00:22:00,955
You might feel a bit of a vacuum.

415
00:22:31,995 --> 00:22:33,395
Wait a second.

416
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:29,346
Thank you, etienne. Thank you, everyone!

417
00:23:29,435 --> 00:23:30,585
We are the four horsemen.

418
00:23:30,715 --> 00:23:31,831
And good night!

419
00:23:31,915 --> 00:23:33,474
Good night!

420
00:23:45,835 --> 00:23:47,030
Hold up here.

421
00:23:47,435 --> 00:23:48,994
Dylan rhodes.

422
00:23:50,515 --> 00:23:52,632
What? I don't think I heard you correctly.

423
00:23:52,715 --> 00:23:54,195
Did you say magicians?

424
00:23:54,275 --> 00:23:56,187
Yeah, Dylan, magicians.

425
00:23:56,275 --> 00:23:57,470
<i>Where are you now?</i>

426
00:23:57,555 --> 00:23:59,547
I'm at Aria. I'm heading
up there to grab 'em now.

427
00:24:03,755 --> 00:24:05,667
FBI! Hands where I can see them.

428
00:24:05,755 --> 00:24:07,155
Let's go. Get 'em up. Come on.

429
00:24:08,515 --> 00:24:10,234
Let's go. Get 'em up.

430
00:24:10,435 --> 00:24:11,755
Put the book down.

431
00:24:11,955 --> 00:24:13,708
Okay. You got me.

432
00:24:13,795 --> 00:24:15,275
- Freeze! Hands in the air!
- Oh, my!

433
00:24:15,795 --> 00:24:18,549
Do one of you guys
mind giving us a hand with our bags?

434
00:24:19,075 --> 00:24:20,111
Let's go.

435
00:24:37,955 --> 00:24:39,912
<i>Boss, please tell me this is a joke.</i>

436
00:24:40,035 --> 00:24:43,073
<i>I just got Willy Mears
to finger Paulie Attanasio.</i>

437
00:24:43,155 --> 00:24:44,828
I'm a month, two tops,

438
00:24:44,955 --> 00:24:46,389
away from blowing this whole thing open.

439
00:24:46,475 --> 00:24:47,511
Get Turkelson.

440
00:24:47,595 --> 00:24:48,711
He's in Atlantic city.

441
00:24:48,835 --> 00:24:50,064
What about Cowan? Look at him.

442
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,555
He's just sitting there on his ass.

443
00:24:51,635 --> 00:24:52,864
Hilarious, rhodes.

444
00:24:53,315 --> 00:24:54,431
I love you.

445
00:24:54,795 --> 00:24:55,831
Asshole.

446
00:24:56,035 --> 00:24:57,555
I don't have time for this magic crap.

447
00:24:57,675 --> 00:25:00,195
This crap just pulled
three million euro out of a Parisian bank.

448
00:25:00,275 --> 00:25:01,425
- That's how much they got?
- Yeah.

449
00:25:01,555 --> 00:25:03,035
Actually, 3.2.

450
00:25:06,715 --> 00:25:07,705
Who is she?

451
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:09,705
Who are you?

452
00:25:09,795 --> 00:25:11,468
Alma dray from interpol.

453
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,069
I'll be working the investigation with you.

454
00:25:13,155 --> 00:25:14,384
You gotta be kidding me.

455
00:25:14,475 --> 00:25:16,076
It's bad enough they got me chasing down

456
00:25:16,155 --> 00:25:17,271
David Copperfield and friends.

457
00:25:17,355 --> 00:25:20,553
Now I'm being saddled with,
no offense, with interpol?

458
00:25:20,635 --> 00:25:22,866
I look forward to working
with you, too, agent rhodes.

459
00:25:22,995 --> 00:25:25,954
I'm sorry. I don't think I'm gonna
need your help on this. Okay?

460
00:25:26,035 --> 00:25:28,550
- Where's the French guy?
- I already spoke to him.

461
00:25:28,635 --> 00:25:31,195
Oh, you did? You spoke
to my witness before me?

462
00:25:31,275 --> 00:25:34,393
Your witness? I thought
you didn't want the case.

463
00:25:34,475 --> 00:25:36,034
Besides, he's useless.

464
00:25:36,275 --> 00:25:37,914
Oh, really? Why is that?

465
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:40,226
Because he believes their magic was real.

466
00:25:40,315 --> 00:25:41,988
Oh, he believes the magic was real?

467
00:25:42,075 --> 00:25:43,555
You're right, he probably is useless.

468
00:25:43,635 --> 00:25:46,946
Is it okay with interpol
if we talk to him, too?

469
00:25:47,035 --> 00:25:48,628
Thank you.

470
00:25:49,235 --> 00:25:52,433
I have never stolen a
thing in my life, okay?

471
00:25:52,515 --> 00:25:54,871
I tried to give
the money back, but they won't take it.

472
00:25:54,955 --> 00:25:57,424
Okay, okay, okay,
let's just say you robbed a bank.

473
00:25:57,515 --> 00:26:00,030
- I did.
- Fine. Fantastic. You did.

474
00:26:00,155 --> 00:26:02,670
But since I'm new to this,
can you explain to me how you went

475
00:26:02,755 --> 00:26:05,190
from Las Vegas to Paris in three seconds?

476
00:26:05,635 --> 00:26:07,388
With the teleportation helmet.

477
00:26:07,835 --> 00:26:09,508
Okay, what the hell is going on here?

478
00:26:09,595 --> 00:26:11,473
He was hypnotized during the show.

479
00:26:11,555 --> 00:26:13,387
I told you, he's useless.

480
00:26:13,475 --> 00:26:14,591
Okay, I'll deal with you when I'm done

481
00:26:14,675 --> 00:26:16,234
with this other bullshit.

482
00:26:19,835 --> 00:26:20,791
Hey!

483
00:26:20,875 --> 00:26:22,514
During the show,
half the audience was hypnotized

484
00:26:22,635 --> 00:26:23,910
to believe they were in the philharmonic.

485
00:26:23,995 --> 00:26:26,271
I guess that "bullshit"
was the trigger word.

486
00:26:26,355 --> 00:26:29,826
<i>Okay. Hey, hey. Écoutez.
Etienne, come on down from there.</i>

487
00:26:29,915 --> 00:26:31,190
You're not in the philharmonic.

488
00:26:31,275 --> 00:26:33,710
- How do you say "stop" in French?
- Stop.

489
00:26:33,795 --> 00:26:34,831
Tell him to stop.

490
00:26:34,915 --> 00:26:39,194
No, I can't. You just have to
let him finish his movement.

491
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:41,347
Okay, I need a time-out.

492
00:26:41,435 --> 00:26:42,915
Too many French people in one room.

493
00:26:43,075 --> 00:26:44,555
Agent rhodes!

494
00:26:44,635 --> 00:26:47,355
I'm ordered by my bosses
to provide a report.

495
00:26:47,435 --> 00:26:50,473
And until we have one,
I'm here, like it or not.

496
00:26:50,555 --> 00:26:52,148
So we can work together,

497
00:26:52,315 --> 00:26:54,227
or you can continue to follow behind

498
00:26:54,315 --> 00:26:56,432
asking the same exact questions I'm asking.

499
00:26:56,555 --> 00:26:57,750
It's up to you.

500
00:27:01,555 --> 00:27:02,989
I'm not finished.

501
00:27:03,075 --> 00:27:06,864
I just flew 12 hours,
after what was already a long day.

502
00:27:06,955 --> 00:27:09,265
And I do not handle jet lag well.

503
00:27:12,435 --> 00:27:14,791
So if you want to see who can be grumpier,

504
00:27:14,915 --> 00:27:16,986
I promise you, you will lose.

505
00:27:18,635 --> 00:27:20,706
Fine. So which one of these idiots

506
00:27:20,795 --> 00:27:22,229
do you want to talk to first?

507
00:27:22,315 --> 00:27:23,351
Him?

508
00:27:28,875 --> 00:27:30,025
Dylan, for the record,

509
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:32,232
mentalism has never actually
been proven to be accurate.

510
00:27:32,315 --> 00:27:33,351
Okay.

511
00:27:33,435 --> 00:27:34,755
That is to say, that it's not a science.

512
00:27:34,955 --> 00:27:36,184
It's more for entertainment.

513
00:27:36,275 --> 00:27:37,504
All right.

514
00:27:37,595 --> 00:27:40,986
Just don't believe
everything the guy says. That's all.

515
00:27:41,955 --> 00:27:44,789
Please convey my deepest apologies

516
00:27:44,915 --> 00:27:46,668
to your colleague out there.

517
00:27:46,755 --> 00:27:49,111
I'm really sorry about this
whole tranny Tuesday thing.

518
00:27:49,195 --> 00:27:50,345
I was out of line.

519
00:27:50,475 --> 00:27:51,704
Tranny Tuesday?

520
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,468
Well, it's an arrangement
he and his wife have.

521
00:27:53,595 --> 00:27:55,268
Or might not have, if you believe

522
00:27:55,435 --> 00:27:57,825
everything agent Fuller
is saying to be correct.

523
00:27:57,915 --> 00:28:00,555
But isn't there a proud
tradition in the FBI

524
00:28:00,635 --> 00:28:02,513
of men wearing dresses?

525
00:28:03,235 --> 00:28:06,911
<i>No shame, agent Fuller. No shame.</i>

526
00:28:10,035 --> 00:28:11,594
I'm just having fun.

527
00:28:11,675 --> 00:28:14,031
Was this your card? No.

528
00:28:14,115 --> 00:28:15,390
See, I knew you weren't
a queen of hearts lady,

529
00:28:15,475 --> 00:28:16,465
and I respect that.

530
00:28:16,555 --> 00:28:18,433
The trick usually works better
when I'm not strapped in here,

531
00:28:18,515 --> 00:28:19,555
but I understand protocol.

532
00:28:19,635 --> 00:28:20,989
Okay, okay.

533
00:28:21,075 --> 00:28:23,670
So, if you had nothing to do with it,

534
00:28:23,755 --> 00:28:26,315
then how did
the playing card get into the vault?

535
00:28:26,395 --> 00:28:27,395
Oh, yes. That would be...

536
00:28:27,475 --> 00:28:28,989
What do the kids call it these days?

537
00:28:29,115 --> 00:28:30,314
Oh, yes, that's right. Magic.

538
00:28:30,315 --> 00:28:32,307
Just answer the question, okay, smartass.

539
00:28:32,395 --> 00:28:34,990
All right. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

540
00:28:35,995 --> 00:28:37,952
You can keep that. Don't share it with him.

541
00:28:38,155 --> 00:28:41,148
It says here you are a mentalist.

542
00:28:41,795 --> 00:28:44,435
What exactly is mentalism?

543
00:28:44,515 --> 00:28:47,474
Tricks, mostly. Some science.

544
00:28:47,675 --> 00:28:51,510
Targeted guessing
might be a most apt description.

545
00:28:51,675 --> 00:28:54,952
Along with some intuition
and the occasional...

546
00:28:56,595 --> 00:28:58,268
Voices in my head.

547
00:28:59,515 --> 00:29:02,508
Says here you were
fairly famous at one point.

548
00:29:02,595 --> 00:29:04,587
You can
even hypnotize people over the phone.

549
00:29:04,715 --> 00:29:07,184
Some big tours
around the U.S. for a few years,

550
00:29:07,275 --> 00:29:09,267
- two TV specials.
- Glory days.

551
00:29:09,475 --> 00:29:12,946
Then your brother/manager disappeared
with all your hard-earned money.

552
00:29:13,035 --> 00:29:14,355
Did your research, did you?

553
00:29:14,475 --> 00:29:16,273
IRS audit. Back taxes.

554
00:29:16,395 --> 00:29:18,114
You've had a long hard slog back

555
00:29:18,195 --> 00:29:20,630
into the limelight,
haven't you, Mr. McKinney?

556
00:29:20,715 --> 00:29:25,392
Yes, indeed, it has. And I do appreciate
that trip down memory Lane.

557
00:29:25,595 --> 00:29:27,555
As far as I understand it,
when the man from Paris

558
00:29:27,635 --> 00:29:28,785
put on the magical helmet...

559
00:29:28,875 --> 00:29:29,865
Listen to me.

560
00:29:29,995 --> 00:29:32,555
If you didn't rob that bank,
then you knew about it.

561
00:29:32,635 --> 00:29:33,751
Which makes you an accomplice.

562
00:29:33,835 --> 00:29:36,270
So if you wanna walk out of here
today, I'd suggest you start...

563
00:29:36,355 --> 00:29:37,391
Now you listen to me, unless you think

564
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:38,994
there's a D.A. In the state of Nevada

565
00:29:38,995 --> 00:29:40,429
who'd be willing
to make sense of this to a jury,

566
00:29:40,515 --> 00:29:41,755
then we have a show to perform.

567
00:29:41,915 --> 00:29:42,951
And you, agent rhodes,

568
00:29:43,035 --> 00:29:44,355
have a drawing board to get back to.

569
00:29:44,435 --> 00:29:45,915
Is this your first date?

570
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:48,111
What?

571
00:29:48,195 --> 00:29:51,984
No, I mean, obviously, you guys don't
know each other well, if at all.

572
00:29:52,075 --> 00:29:55,591
But, like,
there is a palpable tension in this room.

573
00:29:55,675 --> 00:29:57,507
And before you get involved,

574
00:29:57,595 --> 00:30:01,066
you should consider the fact
that she has a lot of big secrets.

575
00:30:01,195 --> 00:30:02,868
And I know the first one is that

576
00:30:02,955 --> 00:30:06,073
this is your first time off the desk.
Isn't it?

577
00:30:06,515 --> 00:30:07,949
You should have said something to him.

578
00:30:08,035 --> 00:30:10,231
This is a weird way for you to find out.

579
00:30:10,315 --> 00:30:12,147
You are literally
begging to be arrested. You know that?

580
00:30:12,275 --> 00:30:14,585
If it means you would
actually do it, then, yeah. But you won't.

581
00:30:14,675 --> 00:30:16,234
Because if you did, it means that you,

582
00:30:16,235 --> 00:30:18,306
and the FBI, and your friends at interpol,

583
00:30:18,395 --> 00:30:21,866
actually believe,
at an institutional level, in magic.

584
00:30:22,955 --> 00:30:24,548
The press would have a field day.

585
00:30:24,795 --> 00:30:26,548
And we'd be even more famous
than we already are.

586
00:30:26,635 --> 00:30:27,910
And you guys would look like idiots

587
00:30:27,995 --> 00:30:29,270
even more then you already are.

588
00:30:29,355 --> 00:30:32,871
Well, no, not you. But him. Right?

589
00:30:32,955 --> 00:30:34,628
You have,
what we in the business, like to call,

590
00:30:34,715 --> 00:30:36,115
"nothing up your sleeve."

591
00:30:36,275 --> 00:30:37,345
And you know it.

592
00:30:37,475 --> 00:30:39,546
Don't draw him in and then dump him

593
00:30:39,715 --> 00:30:43,072
because abandonment
is a big "area" for him.

594
00:30:43,635 --> 00:30:44,751
Mommy?

595
00:30:45,475 --> 00:30:46,670
Daddy.

596
00:30:46,995 --> 00:30:48,475
You have big daddy issues.

597
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:50,069
- Okay, that's enough.
- I'll tell you what.

598
00:30:50,195 --> 00:30:53,472
Your average therapist is gonna charge you
$200-$300 for this sesh.

599
00:30:53,555 --> 00:30:55,831
Me? I'll take a tenner.

600
00:30:56,395 --> 00:30:59,467
Okay, later, if you're feeling magnanimous,

601
00:30:59,555 --> 00:31:01,467
I'll still take a tenner.

602
00:31:01,715 --> 00:31:03,752
You wanna know who sat
in that chair before you?

603
00:31:03,915 --> 00:31:05,986
Mob bosses, murderers, and thieves.

604
00:31:06,195 --> 00:31:07,595
And you know who put them there?

605
00:31:07,675 --> 00:31:09,587
The guy who's sitting in this chair.

606
00:31:09,715 --> 00:31:13,675
So I warn you,
I can maintain my resolve much longer

607
00:31:13,755 --> 00:31:16,589
than you can maintain
that phony arrogance.

608
00:31:16,675 --> 00:31:18,792
And the instant that you even show

609
00:31:18,875 --> 00:31:21,549
the slightest crack in that smug facade,

610
00:31:21,635 --> 00:31:22,910
I'll be there.

611
00:31:22,995 --> 00:31:24,588
I will be all over you like...

612
00:31:24,675 --> 00:31:25,825
Like white on rice?

613
00:31:26,115 --> 00:31:27,629
Sorry. That's unfair.

614
00:31:27,795 --> 00:31:28,785
Let me warn you.

615
00:31:28,955 --> 00:31:29,991
I want you to follow.

616
00:31:30,235 --> 00:31:31,555
Because no matter
what you think you might know,

617
00:31:31,635 --> 00:31:33,274
we will always be one step, three steps,

618
00:31:33,275 --> 00:31:34,311
seven steps ahead of you.

619
00:31:34,395 --> 00:31:35,590
And just when you think you're catching up,

620
00:31:35,675 --> 00:31:37,075
that's when we'll be right behind you.

621
00:31:37,155 --> 00:31:38,589
And at no time will you be
anywhere other than

622
00:31:38,675 --> 00:31:39,745
exactly where I want you to be.

623
00:31:39,835 --> 00:31:41,474
So come close. Get all over me

624
00:31:41,555 --> 00:31:42,909
because the closer you think you are,

625
00:31:42,995 --> 00:31:44,349
the less you'll actually see.

626
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:45,425
I'm gonna nail you...

627
00:31:49,915 --> 00:31:52,225
Something wrong with that soda, miss?

628
00:32:00,555 --> 00:32:01,784
Oh! Shit!

629
00:32:02,355 --> 00:32:03,869
First rule of magic.

630
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:06,946
Always be the smartest guy in the room.

631
00:32:30,075 --> 00:32:31,953
Boss, what are we doing?
We're letting them go?

632
00:32:32,155 --> 00:32:34,192
They all but admitted
they're gonna do it again.

633
00:32:34,275 --> 00:32:36,312
About a half an hour ago,
you didn't give a damn about them.

634
00:32:36,395 --> 00:32:38,148
- What changed?
- I met them.

635
00:32:38,235 --> 00:32:39,225
Hey. Guys.

636
00:32:39,595 --> 00:32:42,030
Hey, I ran a check on the audience.

637
00:32:42,115 --> 00:32:43,231
Most of it was just filler.

638
00:32:43,315 --> 00:32:44,988
People that Tressler
dragged in to pack the room.

639
00:32:45,075 --> 00:32:46,873
But guess who was sitting
there in the back,

640
00:32:46,955 --> 00:32:48,115
filming the whole damn thing?

641
00:32:48,235 --> 00:32:49,225
I don't know.

642
00:32:49,355 --> 00:32:50,789
Thaddeus Bradley.

643
00:32:53,355 --> 00:32:55,506
Thaddeus Bradley,
the guy from tv with the DVDs and shows?

644
00:32:55,595 --> 00:32:56,585
No.

645
00:32:56,675 --> 00:32:58,985
Okay, well, he debunks magicians.

646
00:32:59,115 --> 00:33:00,913
He exposes them.
He shows you how to do their tricks.

647
00:33:01,035 --> 00:33:02,105
Get him on the phone.

648
00:33:02,195 --> 00:33:03,875
I did. You're having lunch with him in 45.

649
00:33:03,955 --> 00:33:04,991
Good.

650
00:33:05,155 --> 00:33:07,795
<i>Mr. Bradley started as a magician.</i>

651
00:33:07,915 --> 00:33:09,588
- He was actually quite good.
- Really?

652
00:33:09,955 --> 00:33:12,072
- One of the best.
- You don't say.

653
00:33:13,395 --> 00:33:16,274
"The greatest genius
is in seeing through the illusion."

654
00:33:16,355 --> 00:33:18,790
That's a man who loves his work.

655
00:33:20,235 --> 00:33:22,033
You sure I can't interest you
in a glass of wine?

656
00:33:22,115 --> 00:33:24,949
No, no, no. No, thank you, sir.
We're working.

657
00:33:25,435 --> 00:33:26,585
I will take one.

658
00:33:35,115 --> 00:33:37,675
That's incredible. That's amazing.

659
00:33:39,315 --> 00:33:40,465
Red dye, palmed.

660
00:33:40,555 --> 00:33:43,229
Is that how Jesus did it?
That's incredible.

661
00:33:43,315 --> 00:33:44,635
I'm sorry. Can I just take a minute here?

662
00:33:44,715 --> 00:33:47,025
You were one of the great magicians.
Why did you stop?

663
00:33:47,635 --> 00:33:50,309
Do you know how many people went
to see magic performed live

664
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:51,988
in the last half decade?

665
00:33:52,075 --> 00:33:53,304
About 1.6 million.

666
00:33:53,395 --> 00:33:56,752
You know how many DVDs I sold
in the same period?

667
00:33:56,835 --> 00:33:58,110
Five million.

668
00:33:58,195 --> 00:33:59,231
Right, so it's about the money.

669
00:33:59,315 --> 00:34:00,829
Well, the money is only there

670
00:34:00,915 --> 00:34:04,147
because the need to know
is greater than the desire to be fooled.

671
00:34:04,235 --> 00:34:08,548
Like you, I detest those who prey
upon the gullibility of the masses.

672
00:34:08,635 --> 00:34:12,311
With all due respect,
isn't there a cost, though, to this game?

673
00:34:12,835 --> 00:34:13,871
Cost?

674
00:34:13,955 --> 00:34:15,275
I don't know. Careers.

675
00:34:15,355 --> 00:34:16,471
Lives.

676
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:19,753
I assume you're referring to Lionel shrike.

677
00:34:20,235 --> 00:34:22,067
I'm sorry, who?

678
00:34:22,155 --> 00:34:23,635
Lionel shrike.

679
00:34:23,715 --> 00:34:28,107
A middling magician who drowned
in the Hudson river 30 years ago.

680
00:34:28,195 --> 00:34:31,950
On Mr. Bradley's first special,
he revealed all of shrike's tricks.

681
00:34:32,035 --> 00:34:35,472
The next year,
shrike tried to stage a comeback.

682
00:34:35,555 --> 00:34:37,035
He was shackled inside a safe,

683
00:34:37,115 --> 00:34:38,913
and dropped into the river.

684
00:34:38,995 --> 00:34:40,111
But he never resurfaced.

685
00:34:40,195 --> 00:34:42,426
You mean he died?

686
00:34:42,515 --> 00:34:44,313
I didn't kill him.

687
00:34:44,395 --> 00:34:48,674
He killed himself trying to do something
he wasn't prepared to handle.

688
00:34:48,755 --> 00:34:50,951
You do realize this is a game?

689
00:34:51,035 --> 00:34:52,833
Believe me, it's not a game.

690
00:34:52,915 --> 00:34:54,065
It is a game.

691
00:34:54,155 --> 00:34:55,908
You're the game. You're being played.

692
00:34:55,995 --> 00:34:59,466
And your pathetic attempts
at fawning to gain my trust...

693
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:01,308
I mean, come on.

694
00:35:01,395 --> 00:35:02,385
You got me.

695
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:03,704
If you really want to know

696
00:35:03,795 --> 00:35:07,584
how a bank in Paris was robbed
from a stage in Las Vegas,

697
00:35:07,675 --> 00:35:09,632
my special comes out next month.

698
00:35:09,715 --> 00:35:10,836
Or I could just bring you in

699
00:35:10,955 --> 00:35:13,390
on obstruction charges
and force you to tell me.

700
00:35:13,475 --> 00:35:15,034
Unless, of course,
what you're trying to say to me is that

701
00:35:15,115 --> 00:35:18,187
you actually don't know how they did it.

702
00:35:20,195 --> 00:35:22,346
Showmanship and theatrics.

703
00:35:22,555 --> 00:35:24,706
When a magician waves his hand and says,

704
00:35:24,835 --> 00:35:26,396
"this is where the magic is happening."

705
00:35:26,675 --> 00:35:29,065
The real trick is happening somewhere else.

706
00:35:29,595 --> 00:35:32,554
Misdirection. A basic concept of magic.

707
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:34,986
Not interested in the concepts of magic.

708
00:35:35,195 --> 00:35:36,709
I wanna know how they robbed a bank.

709
00:35:36,875 --> 00:35:39,595
You're an idiot if you think
they robbed a bank.

710
00:35:39,835 --> 00:35:41,064
But don't take my word for it.

711
00:35:41,595 --> 00:35:43,268
How about a trip to Paris?

712
00:35:43,715 --> 00:35:46,833
Hermia,
the teleportation helmet, please, darling?

713
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,670
You're joking, right?

714
00:35:48,875 --> 00:35:51,151
You wanna know how they did it or not?

715
00:35:51,835 --> 00:35:54,509
I'm just gonna put this on your head.

716
00:35:55,235 --> 00:35:56,555
Step right up.

717
00:35:57,875 --> 00:35:59,514
There you go.

718
00:36:00,195 --> 00:36:03,871
Now we just pull this down
all safe and snug.

719
00:36:04,915 --> 00:36:07,828
Make yourself comfortable. There we go.

720
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:10,032
And when you're ready to go to Paris,

721
00:36:10,115 --> 00:36:12,186
just say the magic word.

722
00:36:12,555 --> 00:36:13,705
Blow me?

723
00:36:14,715 --> 00:36:16,468
<i>- That'll suffice.
- Bon voyage.</i>

724
00:36:28,475 --> 00:36:31,593
I personally prefer to
take the stairs to Paris.

725
00:36:32,275 --> 00:36:34,232
Welcome to the city of light, agent rhodes.

726
00:36:34,395 --> 00:36:36,193
Hardy Har Har. What was with the helmet?

727
00:36:36,555 --> 00:36:37,750
My fun.

728
00:36:39,115 --> 00:36:40,344
What?

729
00:36:40,435 --> 00:36:41,835
Nothing.

730
00:36:43,555 --> 00:36:44,750
So they got a vault set.

731
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:45,905
Yes.

732
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:47,065
And it's the exact replica

733
00:36:47,235 --> 00:36:48,305
of the little French guy's bank.

734
00:36:48,395 --> 00:36:49,431
So he's a plant.

735
00:36:49,555 --> 00:36:50,989
He was a dupe, not a plant.

736
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:53,226
They chose him. They knew
which seat he was in.

737
00:36:53,715 --> 00:36:55,911
No, no, no, the audience picked the seat.

738
00:36:56,755 --> 00:36:59,509
Unless, of course,
the audience didn't pick the seat.

739
00:36:59,595 --> 00:37:01,666
They let them think they picked the seat.

740
00:37:01,755 --> 00:37:03,109
We'll choose one at random then.

741
00:37:03,635 --> 00:37:05,513
<i>Actually, they were just palming the ball</i>

742
00:37:05,595 --> 00:37:07,314
<i>with the seat number they wanted.</i>

743
00:37:07,755 --> 00:37:09,587
We are looking at row number 5.

744
00:37:09,755 --> 00:37:11,395
Henley, could I please
have a seat number?

745
00:37:11,595 --> 00:37:12,585
Lucky number 13.

746
00:37:12,675 --> 00:37:14,712
Could you just confirm that this
is, in fact, your seat?

747
00:37:14,795 --> 00:37:16,388
<i>He was selected.</i>

748
00:37:17,155 --> 00:37:19,274
<i>They programmed his mind
to make him go to Las Vegas.</i>

749
00:37:19,275 --> 00:37:20,425
Viva Las Vegas.

750
00:37:21,515 --> 00:37:24,553
<i>And then
they kept reinforcing it, until he did.</i>

751
00:37:25,795 --> 00:37:27,024
<i>They trailed him.</i>

752
00:37:27,115 --> 00:37:28,231
<i>They studied him.</i>

753
00:37:28,315 --> 00:37:30,068
<i>Nothing was left to chance.</i>

754
00:37:32,355 --> 00:37:33,345
I got his measurements.

755
00:37:33,475 --> 00:37:35,831
<i>He had no idea he was their target.</i>

756
00:37:35,955 --> 00:37:38,072
<i>And they simply activated him in Vegas.</i>

757
00:37:38,235 --> 00:37:39,464
When I snap my fingers...

758
00:37:39,675 --> 00:37:42,110
And once again, merritt McKinney.

759
00:37:42,275 --> 00:37:43,345
<i>But how did they know what bank was his?</i>

760
00:37:43,675 --> 00:37:44,791
- You're kidding.
- Really?

761
00:37:44,995 --> 00:37:47,555
Can you be any more
of a condescending ass?

762
00:37:47,635 --> 00:37:48,625
Yes.

763
00:37:49,435 --> 00:37:50,425
Like this.

764
00:37:51,595 --> 00:37:54,872
There's a very rare, very mysterious way

765
00:37:54,995 --> 00:37:58,466
in which a magician divines
an audience member's bank.

766
00:37:59,475 --> 00:38:00,465
You ready?

767
00:38:00,915 --> 00:38:01,905
Yes.

768
00:38:02,835 --> 00:38:04,189
Credit card.

769
00:38:04,555 --> 00:38:07,389
And that's how they got
the signature for the card

770
00:38:07,475 --> 00:38:09,432
they left in the vault in Paris.

771
00:38:09,515 --> 00:38:10,505
Very good.

772
00:38:10,795 --> 00:38:12,275
You're being one-upped, agent rhodes.

773
00:38:12,555 --> 00:38:15,354
Okay, but they had to get
the signature card in the vault.

774
00:38:15,515 --> 00:38:16,995
You said they didn't steal the money.

775
00:38:17,235 --> 00:38:18,749
No, I didn't say they
didn't steal the money.

776
00:38:18,835 --> 00:38:20,269
I said they didn't rob the bank.

777
00:38:21,475 --> 00:38:23,432
<i>My guess is that they targeted</i>

778
00:38:23,515 --> 00:38:25,154
<i>a shipment of freshly minted money</i>

779
00:38:25,275 --> 00:38:29,189
<i>headed to the frenchman's bank
on-board an armored truck.</i>

780
00:38:30,595 --> 00:38:33,394
<i>Which, of course,
is just as hard to break into.</i>

781
00:38:33,515 --> 00:38:36,155
<i>Unless you're already inside.</i>

782
00:38:55,715 --> 00:38:58,753
<i>And despite what the banks
would have you believe,</i>

783
00:38:58,835 --> 00:39:01,669
<i>the men who drive
these trucks are not exactly mental giants.</i>

784
00:39:03,395 --> 00:39:04,909
<i>For our horsemen,</i>

785
00:39:04,995 --> 00:39:07,271
<i>it was almost too easy.</i>

786
00:39:13,555 --> 00:39:14,705
Hey, boys.

787
00:39:21,115 --> 00:39:24,665
So, how did they make the fake money
disappear from the vault? What is that?

788
00:39:25,115 --> 00:39:26,515
<i>Flash paper.</i>

789
00:39:28,795 --> 00:39:30,991
<i>Magicians use it all the time.</i>

790
00:39:36,155 --> 00:39:38,954
<i>Creates no smoke, leaves no residue.</i>

791
00:39:44,355 --> 00:39:46,711
<i>Two days ago, no one heard of these guys,</i>

792
00:39:46,875 --> 00:39:49,470
<i>but tonight's show sold out in 35 seconds.</i>

793
00:39:49,555 --> 00:39:51,990
I think these guys have cracked
the secret to show business.

794
00:39:52,075 --> 00:39:54,829
Give your audience $3 million.

795
00:39:55,035 --> 00:39:56,514
Puts 'em in a good mood, doesn't it?

796
00:39:56,515 --> 00:39:57,710
Best finale ever.

797
00:39:57,795 --> 00:40:00,264
<i>They're gonna be
the first magicians in history to get laid.</i>

798
00:40:00,355 --> 00:40:02,790
<i>Remember, if the oxygen mask comes down,</i>

799
00:40:02,915 --> 00:40:04,952
<i>put it on the lawyer first. Remember.
- Oh, yes.</i>

800
00:40:05,035 --> 00:40:07,345
<i>I always do. It's lawyer first,</i>

801
00:40:07,435 --> 00:40:09,554
<i>- then myself and then the children.
- Then yourself.</i>

802
00:40:09,555 --> 00:40:10,989
Yes. Then the children.

803
00:40:11,875 --> 00:40:14,515
Allow me to make plain
what we've both been thinking.

804
00:40:14,635 --> 00:40:15,785
And what's that?

805
00:40:15,875 --> 00:40:18,947
Well, obviously, you have feelings
of affection for Daniel.

806
00:40:19,035 --> 00:40:21,186
Unrequited and misguided,

807
00:40:21,275 --> 00:40:24,074
owing to his lack of
emotional availability.

808
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:26,829
Consequently, you're very tightly...

809
00:40:26,915 --> 00:40:28,554
How should I put it?

810
00:40:29,035 --> 00:40:30,025
Corked.

811
00:40:30,115 --> 00:40:31,105
Oh, I am?

812
00:40:31,235 --> 00:40:34,831
Now, recognizing that
you have physical needs not being met,

813
00:40:34,915 --> 00:40:37,555
and strictly in the vein of
helping a sister out,

814
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:42,346
I invite you to think
of me as your own personal corkscrew.

815
00:40:42,555 --> 00:40:43,671
Wow. Thanks.

816
00:40:43,755 --> 00:40:46,509
Let me mull over
that offer of cheap and meaningless sex.

817
00:40:46,595 --> 00:40:50,509
Cheap and meaningless, maybe,
but not time-consuming.

818
00:40:54,155 --> 00:40:56,147
<i>We should be getting there
a few minutes early.</i>

819
00:40:56,235 --> 00:40:57,305
<i>So, sit back, relax.</i>

820
00:40:57,395 --> 00:40:59,148
<i>We should be in the big easy soon.</i>

821
00:40:59,235 --> 00:41:00,954
<i>Appreciate you flying with us today.</i>

822
00:41:01,035 --> 00:41:03,504
So, what's in it
for Tressler, besides the money?

823
00:41:03,595 --> 00:41:04,665
Ego.

824
00:41:06,315 --> 00:41:08,068
Okay, pick your card.

825
00:41:08,595 --> 00:41:11,030
Look at it, put it in
the deck, and tell me.

826
00:41:11,115 --> 00:41:12,947
No, don't tell me.

827
00:41:13,035 --> 00:41:14,833
- Okay.
- Okay.

828
00:41:14,915 --> 00:41:16,349
Thaddeus was there that night.

829
00:41:16,435 --> 00:41:18,825
He knows exactly
how they pulled it off. What about him?

830
00:41:18,915 --> 00:41:20,588
What are you saying?

831
00:41:20,675 --> 00:41:22,189
You think they could be working together.

832
00:41:22,275 --> 00:41:23,675
I don't know. All I know is that these guys

833
00:41:23,755 --> 00:41:25,235
were a bunch of street magicians

834
00:41:25,315 --> 00:41:26,829
a year ago with no resources.

835
00:41:26,955 --> 00:41:29,470
So, how do they go from doing that to this

836
00:41:29,555 --> 00:41:31,035
without some kind of outside help?

837
00:41:31,115 --> 00:41:32,515
Is this your card?

838
00:41:32,595 --> 00:41:36,032
No, my card is sitting
over there in that guy's lap.

839
00:41:36,675 --> 00:41:38,348
Nice shuffle.

840
00:41:38,435 --> 00:41:39,630
You know, this is hard.

841
00:41:39,715 --> 00:41:40,751
According to this book,

842
00:41:40,835 --> 00:41:44,875
some of those guys practice one simple
move eight hours a day for years.

843
00:41:44,955 --> 00:41:47,993
Really? Some of those guys
seriously need to get a life.

844
00:41:48,075 --> 00:41:50,351
Is it magicians, in general,
you have a problem with?

845
00:41:50,435 --> 00:41:52,666
Or specifically those guys?

846
00:41:53,435 --> 00:41:55,995
I could care less about
magicians in general.

847
00:41:56,075 --> 00:41:58,909
What I hate is people
who exploit other people.

848
00:41:58,995 --> 00:42:00,145
Exploit them how?

849
00:42:00,235 --> 00:42:01,555
Try again.

850
00:42:02,675 --> 00:42:04,587
By taking advantage of their weaknesses.

851
00:42:04,675 --> 00:42:07,429
Their need to believe in
something that's unexplainable

852
00:42:07,515 --> 00:42:10,394
in order to make their lives more bearable.

853
00:42:10,595 --> 00:42:12,268
I see it as a strength.

854
00:42:12,355 --> 00:42:14,312
My life is happier when I believe that.

855
00:42:15,355 --> 00:42:16,755
Is this your card?

856
00:42:17,915 --> 00:42:19,031
Yeah.

857
00:42:19,875 --> 00:42:20,945
Yeah?

858
00:42:21,035 --> 00:42:22,594
- Yeah.
- Cool.

859
00:42:24,955 --> 00:42:28,312
That smile on your face. Is it real?

860
00:42:28,435 --> 00:42:29,664
Maybe.

861
00:42:30,115 --> 00:42:32,550
So let me ask you, Mr. detective man.

862
00:42:32,635 --> 00:42:34,035
Do you feel exploited?

863
00:42:34,115 --> 00:42:37,392
Or did you have maybe
a tiny, tiny bit of fun?

864
00:42:39,635 --> 00:42:40,864
Guy goes to the doctor.

865
00:42:40,955 --> 00:42:41,991
Doctor says, "sir, you're gonna"

866
00:42:42,115 --> 00:42:43,274
"have to stop masturbating."

867
00:42:43,275 --> 00:42:44,265
He says, "why?"

868
00:42:44,355 --> 00:42:45,789
He says, "so I can finish the examination."

869
00:42:45,875 --> 00:42:46,991
Oh, Danny, can I talk to you about

870
00:42:47,075 --> 00:42:48,589
- my role in the show real quick?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.

871
00:42:48,675 --> 00:42:49,950
Hey, guys.

872
00:42:50,395 --> 00:42:51,795
We got a show to prepare for.

873
00:42:51,915 --> 00:42:54,225
Do we now?

874
00:42:54,315 --> 00:42:55,355
No, no, no, don't do that.

875
00:42:55,435 --> 00:42:56,585
You're not doing that thing to me. No.

876
00:42:56,755 --> 00:42:58,030
What thing? I'm just looking at you.

877
00:42:58,115 --> 00:42:59,708
No, you're not.
I've been watching you for a year.

878
00:42:59,795 --> 00:43:01,149
I know all of your little tricks.

879
00:43:01,235 --> 00:43:02,385
That what they are to you? Tricks?

880
00:43:02,475 --> 00:43:04,195
Yes, it's gimmicks. It's barnum statements.

881
00:43:04,275 --> 00:43:05,994
It's reading the eyes. Body language.
I get it.

882
00:43:06,075 --> 00:43:07,748
If it's such an easy thing,
why don't you do henley?

883
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,588
Yeah, Danny. Why don't you do me?

884
00:43:09,675 --> 00:43:11,826
No, you're too easy. I'll do Jasmine.

885
00:43:11,915 --> 00:43:13,429
No.

886
00:43:13,755 --> 00:43:14,745
Do me.

887
00:43:14,835 --> 00:43:16,269
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Do art.

888
00:43:16,355 --> 00:43:17,345
Okay.

889
00:43:17,475 --> 00:43:18,511
Even better.

890
00:43:18,595 --> 00:43:19,585
- Art.
- Yeah.

891
00:43:19,675 --> 00:43:21,473
But I warn you, I can be difficult to read,

892
00:43:21,555 --> 00:43:22,545
when I want to be.

893
00:43:22,635 --> 00:43:24,831
Just stay with me, okay?

894
00:43:25,475 --> 00:43:27,387
So, art, you were a tough kid.

895
00:43:27,475 --> 00:43:29,512
You know, kind of a real rapscallion.

896
00:43:29,595 --> 00:43:31,507
You had a dog. A real tough dog.

897
00:43:31,595 --> 00:43:33,507
A brutish breed. Like a real...

898
00:43:33,595 --> 00:43:35,791
I want to say, Ben the bulldog.

899
00:43:35,875 --> 00:43:38,265
Actually, I was a prissy little tot.

900
00:43:38,355 --> 00:43:41,427
I had a fluffy white cat called snuffles.

901
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:44,270
Sorry.

902
00:43:44,435 --> 00:43:45,585
Wait, let me try one.

903
00:43:45,675 --> 00:43:46,745
- I can do way better than that.
- Let him do it.

904
00:43:46,835 --> 00:43:47,905
Come on, give me
one more time. One more time.

905
00:43:47,995 --> 00:43:49,588
He can do way better than that.

906
00:43:49,675 --> 00:43:50,665
Let's do family.

907
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:53,947
You had an Uncle on your mother's side.

908
00:43:54,115 --> 00:43:56,710
He had a real, kind of...
A real masculine name.

909
00:43:56,795 --> 00:43:59,026
A real, kind of, salt-of-the-earth...

910
00:43:59,115 --> 00:44:00,629
You know, a real stick-it-to-you...

911
00:44:00,715 --> 00:44:04,868
Like it was some kind of Paul.
Thompson? Was it a Paul...

912
00:44:05,035 --> 00:44:06,628
Okay. You know what? I got nothin'.

913
00:44:06,715 --> 00:44:08,229
- Nearly though.
- Was I?

914
00:44:08,315 --> 00:44:11,706
Yeah. My Uncle's name
was Cushman Armitage.

915
00:44:11,875 --> 00:44:13,434
Really? Snuffles and Cushman Armitage?

916
00:44:13,515 --> 00:44:14,551
That was your childhood?

917
00:44:14,635 --> 00:44:17,035
I certainly hope tonight's show
is gonna be better than this.

918
00:44:17,915 --> 00:44:20,032
Don't worry. Just you wait.

919
00:44:25,315 --> 00:44:28,387
Hey. Come on, give me some good news
on a hotel room, please.

920
00:44:28,475 --> 00:44:29,625
<i>What, are you kidding me?</i>

921
00:44:29,715 --> 00:44:31,229
No, it's mardi gras, Dylan.

922
00:44:31,315 --> 00:44:33,227
There's nothing within
sight of the theater.

923
00:44:33,315 --> 00:44:35,705
Hold on a second. Hold on.
Where is this woman?

924
00:44:37,595 --> 00:44:39,552
Hey, hey! There you are.

925
00:44:39,835 --> 00:44:41,235
What, the French girl
doing a little sightseeing

926
00:44:41,355 --> 00:44:42,345
while she's in new Orleans?

927
00:44:42,435 --> 00:44:44,631
No. In fact, here, speaking French

928
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:46,434
is actually an asset.

929
00:44:46,515 --> 00:44:47,995
Do you see that woman up there?

930
00:44:49,075 --> 00:44:50,191
That's Marie Claire.

931
00:44:50,275 --> 00:44:52,506
And she has a lovely apartment for us.

932
00:44:54,835 --> 00:44:56,189
You're welcome.

933
00:44:56,515 --> 00:44:57,835
Yeah.

934
00:44:57,915 --> 00:44:59,508
We got a place.

935
00:44:59,995 --> 00:45:02,430
If you want to keep playing
into their hands, go for it.

936
00:45:02,515 --> 00:45:04,427
I'm just
trying to understand how they think.

937
00:45:04,515 --> 00:45:06,746
You think I'm playing
in their hands, do you?

938
00:45:06,835 --> 00:45:09,634
I don't know how any of that
is gonna go against this.

939
00:45:09,715 --> 00:45:11,866
This what? This magic?

940
00:45:13,315 --> 00:45:14,669
Lionel shrike.

941
00:45:14,875 --> 00:45:18,425
In central park,
he has a guy pick a card and sign it.

942
00:45:18,515 --> 00:45:21,508
Then he goes to a tree
that has been there 20 years.

943
00:45:21,675 --> 00:45:23,075
They saw the tree in half.

944
00:45:23,155 --> 00:45:25,272
Inside the tree, encased in glass,

945
00:45:25,355 --> 00:45:27,187
is the card with the signature.

946
00:45:27,275 --> 00:45:28,391
How did he do that?

947
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:31,786
I have no idea.
But I'm sure there's a logical explanation.

948
00:45:35,075 --> 00:45:36,475
You guys got a guy in that lobby yet?

949
00:45:36,555 --> 00:45:38,148
<i>No, but I do have some good news.</i>

950
00:45:38,355 --> 00:45:40,312
Remember how atlas is such a control freak,

951
00:45:40,395 --> 00:45:42,148
he's got his whole crew
on those tracking bracelets?

952
00:45:42,235 --> 00:45:43,510
What tracking bracelets?

953
00:45:43,595 --> 00:45:44,870
<i>He has every member of his crew</i>

954
00:45:44,955 --> 00:45:46,514
<i>wearing a tracking bracelet.</i>

955
00:45:46,595 --> 00:45:48,712
<i>Those bracelets are on a sub-8 flat-band.</i>

956
00:45:48,795 --> 00:45:49,945
<i>So as long as atlas is tracking them...</i>

957
00:45:50,035 --> 00:45:51,105
Next.

958
00:45:51,195 --> 00:45:52,276
Our boys can track atlas

959
00:45:52,355 --> 00:45:53,789
from right here in the mobile command unit.

960
00:45:53,875 --> 00:45:55,832
<i>Okay, call me if you get any movement.</i>

961
00:45:55,915 --> 00:45:57,235
Copy that.

962
00:46:06,035 --> 00:46:08,425
You are missing the big
picture here, Dylan.

963
00:46:09,755 --> 00:46:13,385
There is a place in Paris, pont des arts.

964
00:46:13,555 --> 00:46:17,390
Sometimes in the mornings
I sit on a bench there.

965
00:46:17,795 --> 00:46:19,434
And I watch the people make a wish

966
00:46:19,555 --> 00:46:21,626
and lock it in a lock on the bridge.

967
00:46:21,715 --> 00:46:24,389
Then throw the key into the seine.

968
00:46:26,235 --> 00:46:30,832
All day they do this.
Mothers, lovers, old men.

969
00:46:31,075 --> 00:46:33,032
Watching the key sink into the water

970
00:46:33,115 --> 00:46:36,347
and their secret is locked away forever.

971
00:46:37,235 --> 00:46:41,593
Real and, at the same time, magical.

972
00:46:47,795 --> 00:46:48,911
So,

973
00:46:49,755 --> 00:46:53,431
do you really think it's possible
there's a fifth horseman?

974
00:46:54,915 --> 00:46:56,190
Yeah.

975
00:47:02,595 --> 00:47:04,507
<i>There is a legend of a secret order</i>

976
00:47:04,595 --> 00:47:06,473
<i>born in ancient Egypt called.</i>

977
00:47:06,955 --> 00:47:08,230
<i>"The eye."</i>

978
00:47:09,955 --> 00:47:12,390
<i>It is said they perfected sleight of hand</i>

979
00:47:12,475 --> 00:47:14,592
<i>to steal food from the pharaohs</i>

980
00:47:14,675 --> 00:47:16,428
<i>and give it to the slaves.</i>

981
00:47:16,835 --> 00:47:18,030
<i>Their purpose?</i>

982
00:47:18,115 --> 00:47:22,109
<i>Using magic
and illusion to even the scales of justice.</i>

983
00:47:22,995 --> 00:47:27,353
<i>Are the horsemen next in a long line
of fools to believe this myth?</i>

984
00:47:27,715 --> 00:47:32,471
Will they evade the rules of law and logic
like they did in Las Vegas?

985
00:47:33,315 --> 00:47:37,548
Or will the dark mysticism
of this Southern swampland

986
00:47:38,155 --> 00:47:39,714
get the better of them?

987
00:47:46,155 --> 00:47:47,635
Bravo, Mr. Bradley.

988
00:47:47,835 --> 00:47:49,827
Either you have a cease-and-desist,

989
00:47:49,915 --> 00:47:52,191
which you don't, or you should leave.

990
00:47:52,395 --> 00:47:56,150
If I want something to cease or desist,

991
00:47:57,315 --> 00:47:58,510
it does.

992
00:47:58,715 --> 00:47:59,865
Take five.

993
00:48:00,195 --> 00:48:01,993
According to your potential backers,

994
00:48:02,195 --> 00:48:05,825
you stand to make 2.5 million tops

995
00:48:05,995 --> 00:48:07,554
from your best special.

996
00:48:07,755 --> 00:48:10,429
I have here a check

997
00:48:12,195 --> 00:48:13,424
for 3.5 million.

998
00:48:13,675 --> 00:48:14,665
To walk away?

999
00:48:14,835 --> 00:48:18,511
To fly away. My jet is at your disposal.

1000
00:48:20,675 --> 00:48:23,349
Let's not kid ourselves, Mr. Tressler.

1001
00:48:24,955 --> 00:48:27,026
You're in this to ride them up.

1002
00:48:27,515 --> 00:48:29,507
I'm in it to ride them down.

1003
00:48:29,875 --> 00:48:32,868
I take it that we do not have a deal.

1004
00:48:34,355 --> 00:48:38,713
And therein lies our conflict.

1005
00:48:42,115 --> 00:48:43,344
Let me be blunt.

1006
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:48,233
My bank account
is much, much bigger than yours.

1007
00:48:48,475 --> 00:48:51,309
And my lawyers are much stronger.

1008
00:48:51,635 --> 00:48:54,707
And they will manacle you

1009
00:48:55,955 --> 00:48:57,787
with so many injunctions.

1010
00:48:58,075 --> 00:49:00,306
Until you stand by, hopelessly watching

1011
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:03,069
everything that you own drain away

1012
00:49:03,875 --> 00:49:06,390
in front of your greedy little eyes.

1013
00:49:06,515 --> 00:49:08,711
This isn't the first time
I've been threatened.

1014
00:49:10,115 --> 00:49:11,595
And I'm still here.

1015
00:49:11,675 --> 00:49:16,033
It is, however, the first time
you've been threatened by me.

1016
00:49:16,915 --> 00:49:21,307
And if you do anything
to Sully my investment,

1017
00:49:21,395 --> 00:49:23,785
the ride down, which you mentioned,

1018
00:49:23,875 --> 00:49:29,109
will be sudden, precipitous,
and measurable on the Richter scale.

1019
00:49:30,755 --> 00:49:32,747
You shouldn't have done that.

1020
00:49:34,075 --> 00:49:35,668
According to superstition,

1021
00:49:35,875 --> 00:49:38,868
one who uses a doll
to enact one's own wrath,

1022
00:49:38,955 --> 00:49:43,427
is likely to bring that
very wrath unto himself.

1023
00:49:44,275 --> 00:49:45,755
Isn't that funny?

1024
00:49:46,595 --> 00:49:48,587
And I thought you didn't believe in magic.

1025
00:49:58,515 --> 00:49:59,631
Do me a favor.

1026
00:49:59,715 --> 00:50:03,755
Visualize your most adventurous
sexual experience.

1027
00:50:03,835 --> 00:50:04,871
Stay out of my head, you perv.

1028
00:50:04,955 --> 00:50:08,665
Well, no, if I stay out of your head,
I'm never gonna get into your pants.

1029
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:10,747
- Right.
- So let's stick with this exercise.

1030
00:50:10,835 --> 00:50:12,713
- And it helps...
- Pardon the intrusion.

1031
00:50:12,795 --> 00:50:15,390
I just wanted to wish
you good luck tonight.

1032
00:50:15,475 --> 00:50:18,035
What, so you can try to expose us later
on your little website?

1033
00:50:18,155 --> 00:50:19,350
And on demand.

1034
00:50:19,435 --> 00:50:22,394
- That's not gonna happen.
- Oh, no?

1035
00:50:22,475 --> 00:50:25,468
Operating on a special plane
because of the eye?

1036
00:50:26,195 --> 00:50:31,031
I heard it's a lovely place.
Lots of starshine and moonbeams.

1037
00:50:31,115 --> 00:50:33,550
Make any magician's wish come true.

1038
00:50:33,635 --> 00:50:35,069
You've come a long way,

1039
00:50:35,155 --> 00:50:36,987
much further
than anyone would have expected

1040
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:39,067
of a bunch of wanna-bes and has-beens.

1041
00:50:39,155 --> 00:50:43,308
If by "has-been" you're referring to me,
I just wanna say I'm flattered,

1042
00:50:43,395 --> 00:50:46,786
because I always considered myself
a never-was.

1043
00:50:46,875 --> 00:50:49,026
Do you mind if I do a quick read on you?

1044
00:50:49,835 --> 00:50:50,825
By all means.

1045
00:50:51,835 --> 00:50:56,512
Okay, I'm picturing a little boy.

1046
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:59,508
He wants to be a great magician someday.

1047
00:50:59,595 --> 00:51:01,393
And though he's good,
he's not quite good enough.

1048
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:05,549
So he ends up at the bottom
of the entertainment food chain,

1049
00:51:05,635 --> 00:51:09,231
feeding off of those
who have the talent that he never did.

1050
00:51:09,315 --> 00:51:11,875
Tell me. Am I getting close?

1051
00:51:14,515 --> 00:51:17,508
Wait. Before you go. I'm working
on something new. Do you have a second?

1052
00:51:18,195 --> 00:51:21,029
Okay. Name a card.

1053
00:51:21,115 --> 00:51:22,708
- King of hearts.
- Knew it.

1054
00:51:22,795 --> 00:51:23,990
Okay.

1055
00:51:31,195 --> 00:51:34,313
- It's up your left sleeve.
- Is it?

1056
00:51:34,395 --> 00:51:36,114
No. No, I don't see it up there.

1057
00:51:36,195 --> 00:51:39,905
You know, why don't you check
your unnecessary velveteen pocket there?

1058
00:51:41,755 --> 00:51:42,745
Yeah.

1059
00:51:46,235 --> 00:51:51,230
Anyway, thank you so much for coming by, but
this is kind of a talent only area, so...

1060
00:51:52,475 --> 00:51:53,465
Break a leg.

1061
00:51:53,555 --> 00:51:55,706
Hey, you break something, too.

1062
00:51:55,835 --> 00:51:57,110
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1063

1066

00:52:05,715 --> 00:52:07,866

1070
00:52:12,195 --> 00:52:15,586
<i>Thank you. The show
will begin in a few minutes.</i>

1071
00:52:19,555 --> 00:52:21,035
Nice watch.

1072
00:52:22,235 --> 00:52:24,545
It's a family heirloom.

1073
00:52:27,755 --> 00:52:30,475
By the way, I know how he did that trick.

1074
00:52:30,555 --> 00:52:32,148
- Who?
- Shrike.

1075
00:52:32,235 --> 00:52:34,466
So, when he was 14,

1076
00:52:34,555 --> 00:52:36,706
he saw a hole in a tree in central park.

1077
00:52:36,835 --> 00:52:40,465
He had a guy who worked at the carousel

1078
00:52:40,555 --> 00:52:43,195
sign a card for what looked
like a routine little trick.

1079
00:52:43,275 --> 00:52:44,425
And?

1080
00:52:44,515 --> 00:52:48,714
At the guy's retirement, 18 years later,

1081
00:52:48,795 --> 00:52:52,027
shrike performs, has the guy sign a card,

1082
00:52:52,115 --> 00:52:53,708
and presto!

1083
00:52:53,795 --> 00:52:55,548
The card is in the tree.

1084
00:52:55,635 --> 00:52:57,513
It was in the tree for 18 years.

1085
00:52:57,595 --> 00:52:59,029
The card was in the tree.

1086
00:52:59,115 --> 00:53:03,109
The tree grew around the card in 18 years.
I mean, that isn't magic. It's not magic.

1087
00:53:03,235 --> 00:53:06,148
The point is, the trick
was not to look closely.

1088
00:53:06,235 --> 00:53:08,227
It was to look so far

1089
00:53:08,315 --> 00:53:11,114
that you see 20 years into the past.

1090
00:53:11,195 --> 00:53:14,074
After shrike drowned,
they never found the body.

1091
00:53:14,155 --> 00:53:15,953
What are you suggesting?

1092
00:53:19,555 --> 00:53:21,751
<i>Arthur Tressler presents.</i>

1093
00:53:21,835 --> 00:53:22,985
<i>Jack Wilder,</i>

00:53:27,355 --> 00:53:29,312
<i>The four horsemen.</i>

1098
00:53:34,515 --> 00:53:36,154
Thank you. Before we begin,

1099
00:53:36,235 --> 00:53:38,272
we'd like to single out
two people in particular.

1100
00:53:38,395 --> 00:53:40,830
A man and a woman to whom we'd like
to dedicate tonight's performance.

1101
00:53:40,915 --> 00:53:42,747
FBI agent Dylan rhodes

1102
00:53:42,835 --> 00:53:48,547
and the lovely, if somewhat inexperienced,
interpol agent Alma dray, everyone.

1103
00:53:49,475 --> 00:53:53,594
Yeah, agent rhodes has personally vowed
to "nail us."

1104
00:53:53,675 --> 00:53:58,192
And we encourage him to do so
if he has the brains and the fur.

1105
00:54:02,435 --> 00:54:04,586
What is magic?

1106
00:54:04,715 --> 00:54:07,184
Our argument,
nothing but targeted deception.

1107
00:54:08,915 --> 00:54:10,269
So I want you to look.

1108
00:54:10,875 --> 00:54:12,912
Look as closely as possible.

1109
00:54:13,315 --> 00:54:15,034
Because the tricks you are about to see

1110
00:54:15,595 --> 00:54:17,268
may not seem connected.

1111
00:54:17,355 --> 00:54:19,267
But we assure you, they are.

1112
00:54:20,235 --> 00:54:23,034
Is what follows 100 different tricks?

1113
00:54:23,395 --> 00:54:27,025
Or is it one giant illusion?

1114
00:54:34,675 --> 00:54:37,668
And now for one
of the oldest tricks in the book.

1115
00:54:37,795 --> 00:54:39,946
Danny, if you wouldn't mind
opening up the box,

1116
00:54:40,035 --> 00:54:42,266
and showing everybody
that it's completely empty.

1117
00:54:42,475 --> 00:54:46,469
Now, we're gonna need
12 courageous volunteers.

1118
00:54:46,715 --> 00:54:48,946
I'm gonna take sweet little Fluffy here,

1119
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:51,869
and put her inside this mystery box.

1120
00:54:52,275 --> 00:54:53,994
There are two pencils out there.

1121
00:54:54,075 --> 00:54:55,304
Hold 'em up high. Let me see 'em.

1122
00:54:55,395 --> 00:54:56,875
- Here!
- Yeah!

1123
00:54:57,315 --> 00:54:59,272
And now, you will say the magic word.

1124
00:54:59,355 --> 00:55:00,630
Abracadabra.

1125
00:55:00,715 --> 00:55:02,069
Yes, and I will wave this magic wand

1126
00:55:02,155 --> 00:55:03,748
for no reason. And then...

1127
00:55:03,835 --> 00:55:06,270
Fluffy has
magically vanished before your very eyes.

1128
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:09,826
If you haven't experienced mass hypnosis,

1129
00:55:09,915 --> 00:55:11,065
you're about to.

1130
00:55:11,355 --> 00:55:12,425
And sleep.

1131
00:55:12,515 --> 00:55:15,349
Down, down. Sleep, sleep.
Completely sleep.

1132
00:55:15,435 --> 00:55:17,028
Good, good. Sleep, sleep.

1133
00:55:17,115 --> 00:55:19,152
And now we are gonna debunk

1134
00:55:19,235 --> 00:55:21,352
a few magic myths this evening.

1135
00:55:21,435 --> 00:55:24,587
We all know that Fluffy is,
in fact, alive and well.

1136
00:55:24,915 --> 00:55:27,430
And Fluffy has miraculously appeared.

1137
00:55:27,515 --> 00:55:29,029
As has the mirror

1138
00:55:29,115 --> 00:55:31,505
which makes the box only
appear as though it's empty.

1139
00:55:31,635 --> 00:55:33,706
When you hear the word "freeze"

1140
00:55:33,915 --> 00:55:36,111
you are all football players.

1141
00:55:36,635 --> 00:55:39,104
And your job is to tackle,

1142
00:55:39,275 --> 00:55:40,629
dismantle,

1143
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:41,945
crush,

1144
00:55:42,195 --> 00:55:44,551
tear limb from limb,

1145
00:55:44,915 --> 00:55:46,634
the quarterback.

1146
00:55:47,995 --> 00:55:51,511
Now, we've all heard
of pulling the rabbit out of the hat.

1147
00:55:51,595 --> 00:55:54,588
But has anyone heard
of pulling a hat out of a rabbit?

1148
00:55:59,035 --> 00:56:01,470
You will know who the quarterback is.

1149
00:56:01,555 --> 00:56:04,912
He will be the one saying that word.

1150
00:56:04,995 --> 00:56:06,145
Freeze.

1151
00:56:16,955 --> 00:56:18,947
Three, two, one...

1152
00:56:19,875 --> 00:56:22,185
- Elvis, help me out, bud.
- Thank you very much.

1153
00:56:22,435 --> 00:56:24,950
In Jack's bowl
are ping pong balls with section numbers.

1154
00:56:25,035 --> 00:56:27,027
Jack, could you hand me a section number?

1155
00:56:27,235 --> 00:56:28,715
Thank you. We are looking at section B.

1156
00:56:28,795 --> 00:56:29,945
Where is section B?

1157
00:56:30,635 --> 00:56:33,150
Okay. There. It's gonna be
one of you guys. Get ready.

1158
00:56:33,635 --> 00:56:34,955
I don't know why everybody's happy.

1159
00:56:35,035 --> 00:56:36,105
It's only them.

1160
00:56:36,395 --> 00:56:37,954
Merritt, can I get a row, please?

1161
00:56:45,395 --> 00:56:47,352
Put your hands in the middle.
One, two, three...

1162
00:56:47,435 --> 00:56:48,869
Kill the quarterback!

1163
00:56:48,955 --> 00:56:50,548
Get on back to your seats.

1164
00:56:50,795 --> 00:56:52,912
I got a feeling
I'm gonna be seeing you soon.

1165
00:57:25,355 --> 00:57:26,994
I guess you have lost some weight.

1166
00:57:42,555 --> 00:57:43,705
At the intermission,

1167
00:57:43,915 --> 00:57:46,225
we asked you to write down
your current bank balance,

1168
00:57:46,475 --> 00:57:47,829
and seal it in an envelope.

1169
00:57:47,915 --> 00:57:49,634
Now it's time to take those envelopes out.

1170
00:57:49,635 --> 00:57:50,751
Everyone take 'em out.

1171
00:57:52,155 --> 00:57:53,669
Now, everybody,

1172
00:57:53,755 --> 00:57:56,714
shout out your name. All at once. Go.

1173
00:57:58,435 --> 00:57:59,949
Shout 'em out.

1174
00:58:02,075 --> 00:58:03,987
Clement? Frannick?

1175
00:58:04,195 --> 00:58:06,232
- Yeah! Up here!
- Oh. Way up there.

1176
00:58:06,315 --> 00:58:08,272
Okay. Dina? Robertson?

1177
00:58:08,475 --> 00:58:09,875
That's me!

1178
00:58:09,955 --> 00:58:12,265
Okay. Names. Names. Let's go.

1179
00:58:13,635 --> 00:58:15,592
Josepha Hickey?

1180
00:58:15,715 --> 00:58:16,705
That's me!

1181
00:58:16,795 --> 00:58:19,708
Josepha, I want you
to focus on your balance,

1182
00:58:19,835 --> 00:58:21,792
and count from one to 10 out loud.

1183
00:58:21,995 --> 00:58:23,634
One, two, three, four, five...

1184
00:58:23,715 --> 00:58:24,944
Stop.

1185
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:26,988
Is the first digit 5?

1186
00:58:27,075 --> 00:58:28,031
Yes.

1187
00:58:28,115 --> 00:58:29,469
Do it again. This time, faster.

1188
00:58:29,555 --> 00:58:30,955
One, two, three, four, five, six...

1189
00:58:31,035 --> 00:58:32,105
Stop.

1190
00:58:32,835 --> 00:58:34,349
Six. Again.

1191
00:58:34,435 --> 00:58:35,425
One, two...

1192
00:58:35,635 --> 00:58:39,595
Josepha, is your
bank balance $562 as of today?

1193
00:58:39,795 --> 00:58:41,946
Yeah. That's what I got.

1194
00:58:43,715 --> 00:58:45,274
Unfortunately, you're wrong.

1195
00:58:45,435 --> 00:58:46,471
Okay, Dina,

1196
00:58:48,395 --> 00:58:49,431
1,

1197
00:58:50,035 --> 00:58:51,071
4,

1198
00:58:51,755 --> 00:58:52,745
7,

1199
00:58:53,715 --> 00:58:55,354
- 7.
- Yeah.

1200
00:58:55,435 --> 00:58:59,190
You think it is.
But in fact, you, too, are wrong.

1201
00:58:59,275 --> 00:59:00,425
Clement.

1202
00:59:00,515 --> 00:59:03,474
You do not have $6,500 in your account.

1203
00:59:03,715 --> 00:59:07,504
In fact, everybody stand up. Everybody.

1204
00:59:09,515 --> 00:59:12,269
Yeah. Put your envelopes to your forehead.

1205
00:59:13,795 --> 00:59:15,275
Focus on your number.

1206
00:59:19,515 --> 00:59:22,587
This is... oh, dear. Just as I feared.

1207
00:59:22,715 --> 00:59:24,866
Oh, this is strange.

1208
00:59:25,315 --> 00:59:28,467
You know, I hate to say this,
but you're all wrong.

1209
00:59:28,675 --> 00:59:30,507
Every last one of you is dead wrong

1210
00:59:30,595 --> 00:59:32,712
about what you think is in your account.

1211
00:59:32,795 --> 00:59:34,229
Okay, you can sit down now.

1212
00:59:34,875 --> 00:59:37,151
Yeah. I almost forgot.

1213
00:59:37,275 --> 00:59:40,154
This evening would not be possible

1214
00:59:40,235 --> 00:59:43,751
if it weren't
for our great benefactor Arthur Tressler.

1215
00:59:45,275 --> 00:59:46,914
Big applause! Big applause!

1216
00:59:47,115 --> 00:59:48,469
Art, actually, why don't
you come up on stage

1217
00:59:48,555 --> 00:59:49,705
for the finale?

1218
00:59:49,795 --> 00:59:51,593
- Come on down, art!
- Come on down, art!

1219
00:59:51,675 --> 00:59:53,587
There he goes. Okay, good.

1220
00:59:53,675 --> 00:59:54,711
Are we on red?

1221
00:59:54,795 --> 00:59:56,832
Bright red. We're all standing by.

1222
00:59:56,915 --> 00:59:58,395
All right, no one leaves the theater.
No one.

1223
00:59:58,475 --> 00:59:59,625
There he goes.

1224
01:00:00,275 --> 01:00:02,471
Now, art, did you fill out your envelope?

1225
01:00:02,555 --> 01:00:04,387
Well, no need. We've done it for you.

1226
01:00:05,075 --> 01:00:07,829
Now, art, I took a guess.

1227
01:00:07,915 --> 01:00:10,146
North of 140. Am I right?

1228
01:00:11,275 --> 01:00:13,949
That's 140 million, by the way.

1229
01:00:17,555 --> 01:00:18,545
I'm sorry, merritt.

1230
01:00:18,755 --> 01:00:20,633
How can he be right about his balance

1231
01:00:20,755 --> 01:00:21,905
and everyone else be wrong?

1232
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:25,392
I think possibly because he, too, is wrong.

1233
01:00:25,595 --> 01:00:27,712
Everybody, take out your paper.

1234
01:00:27,875 --> 01:00:30,390
And using the flashlight under your seat,

1235
01:00:30,595 --> 01:00:32,427
start to warm up that paper.

1236
01:00:32,595 --> 01:00:35,747
I think your correct balance
begins to appear.

1237
01:00:39,395 --> 01:00:42,593
Now, art, don't worry,
we have a flashlight for you.

1238
01:00:42,915 --> 01:00:43,951
Yes.

1239
01:00:50,715 --> 01:00:52,115
Look.

1240
01:00:52,955 --> 01:00:54,275
What's going on there, Daniel?

1241
01:00:54,355 --> 01:00:56,035
Wait. This is weird. A second ago, it said

1242
01:00:56,115 --> 01:00:59,870
$144,579,651.

1243
01:00:59,955 --> 01:01:00,945
But now...

1244
01:01:01,475 --> 01:01:04,468
Now it says $70,000 less.

1245
01:01:07,795 --> 01:01:09,229
Josepha, can you stand up?

1246
01:01:09,315 --> 01:01:10,351
Yes.

1247
01:01:10,635 --> 01:01:12,274
Now, what is your new number?

1248
01:01:12,595 --> 01:01:16,908
$70,562 now in my account.

1249
01:01:20,035 --> 01:01:23,426
Is it possible that
Josepha's balance went up

1250
01:01:23,555 --> 01:01:25,626
the exact amount that art's went down?

1251
01:01:25,755 --> 01:01:28,270
Hey. Check it out. It's happening again.

1252
01:01:28,675 --> 01:01:29,711
Is it?

1253
01:01:31,155 --> 01:01:33,465
Wow. It is.

1254
01:01:33,795 --> 01:01:36,993
Art's balance has gone down another 280k.

1255
01:01:37,155 --> 01:01:39,192
Dina robertson? What did yours say?

1256
01:01:39,435 --> 01:01:43,190
$281,477.

1257
01:01:47,035 --> 01:01:48,708
We have a confession to make.

1258
01:01:48,915 --> 01:01:50,907
She's right. We lied about something.

1259
01:01:50,995 --> 01:01:52,668
Yes. None of you were chosen at random.

1260
01:01:52,795 --> 01:01:55,185
All of you have one thing in common.

1261
01:01:55,755 --> 01:01:57,633
Everyone in this room was a victim

1262
01:01:57,715 --> 01:02:00,594
of the hard times that hit one of
America's most treasured cities.

1263
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:03,270
Some of you lost your houses, your cars.

1264
01:02:03,715 --> 01:02:04,705
Your businesses.

1265
01:02:04,875 --> 01:02:05,865
Your loved ones.

1266
01:02:05,995 --> 01:02:09,193
But all of you were insured
by the same company.

1267
01:02:09,355 --> 01:02:11,233
Tressler insurance.

1268
01:02:12,355 --> 01:02:13,505
You were abandoned.

1269
01:02:13,595 --> 01:02:14,665
You were loopholed...

1270
01:02:14,755 --> 01:02:15,984
Out of your settlements.

1271
01:02:17,355 --> 01:02:19,995
This is all for show. Correct?

1272
01:02:20,075 --> 01:02:22,716
"All" meaning we're doing it onstage
in front of a paying audience?

1273
01:02:22,915 --> 01:02:24,516
- Then, yes, it's for show.
- Whoa! Whoa!

1274
01:02:24,835 --> 01:02:27,304
I've got $82,000 in my bank account!

1275
01:02:27,475 --> 01:02:29,307
It says it right here on my cell phone!

1276
01:02:29,555 --> 01:02:32,707
Everybody, look at your
cell phones right now! Everybody!

1277
01:02:40,515 --> 01:02:41,505
Is this for real?

1278
01:02:41,715 --> 01:02:42,865
I don't know.

1279
01:02:43,155 --> 01:02:44,271
<i>Is this happening?</i>

1280
01:02:44,435 --> 01:02:45,994
I don't know! I can't tell!

1281
01:02:46,755 --> 01:02:48,872
Hey! Did you do this?

1282
01:02:50,115 --> 01:02:51,310
How could we, art?

1283
01:02:51,395 --> 01:02:52,545
We don't have your password.

1284
01:02:52,875 --> 01:02:54,195
We'd need access to information

1285
01:02:54,275 --> 01:02:56,187
we could never get our hands on.

1286
01:02:56,395 --> 01:02:58,352
Yes, security questions,
for instance, like,

1287
01:02:58,555 --> 01:03:00,116
I don't know, your mother's maiden name

1288
01:03:00,235 --> 01:03:01,669
or the name of your first pet.

1289
01:03:01,755 --> 01:03:03,553
Where would we get that information, art?

1290
01:03:04,075 --> 01:03:05,668
You certainly would never tell us.

1291
01:03:08,475 --> 01:03:10,835
<i>We got confirmation.
It's really happening. They robbed him.</i>

1292
01:03:12,915 --> 01:03:14,349
Do not let them get away.

1293
01:03:14,435 --> 01:03:16,427
Hey, we left you the jet and the rolls.

1294
01:03:23,435 --> 01:03:24,755
You got hell to pay!

1295
01:03:27,755 --> 01:03:28,745
Stop!

1296
01:03:29,475 --> 01:03:31,273
Stop! Nobody move!

1297
01:03:33,235 --> 01:03:34,305
Freeze!

1298
01:03:34,555 --> 01:03:36,114
Quarterback!

1299
01:03:38,995 --> 01:03:40,987
We are the four horsemen.

1300
01:03:41,475 --> 01:03:42,545
Good night.

1301
01:03:54,795 --> 01:03:56,149
Get 'em off me!

1302
01:03:56,915 --> 01:03:58,508
Get off! Get off me!

1303
01:04:08,835 --> 01:04:10,235
Get off me!

1304
01:04:18,635 --> 01:04:20,786
All right. I want everyone
on the street! Everyone!

1305
01:04:27,555 --> 01:04:29,512
- Quarterback!
- Quarterback!

1306
01:04:30,995 --> 01:04:32,475
Fuller, meet me in front of the theater

1307
01:04:32,555 --> 01:04:34,148
and bring the tracker.

1308
01:04:34,235 --> 01:04:36,625
Let's go! Let's go! Now! Come on! Let's go!

1309
01:04:36,715 --> 01:04:37,831
Give me the tracker.

1310
01:04:38,275 --> 01:04:39,265
Let's go.

1311
01:04:43,435 --> 01:04:44,710
FBI! Clear!

1312
01:04:45,435 --> 01:04:46,585
- Dylan!
- Damn.

1313
01:04:46,675 --> 01:04:47,665
What have you got?

1314
01:04:47,755 --> 01:04:49,269
That's him right there. Follow the red dot.

1315
01:04:49,355 --> 01:04:52,393
All right, I'll take this.
Go. Box 'em. Cut 'em off that way.

1316
01:04:54,355 --> 01:04:55,869
He's turning left on burgundy.

1317
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:34,109
Hey! Move!

1318
01:05:34,235 --> 01:05:35,555
Move! Move!

1319
01:05:38,235 --> 01:05:39,908
I got him heading north on bourbon.

1320
01:05:39,995 --> 01:05:41,873
- Sorry. Move, move!
- Hey!

1321
01:05:41,995 --> 01:05:43,987
Hey, excuse me. Move, move! Excuse me.

1322
01:05:55,435 --> 01:05:57,108
I've lost him at bourbon.

1323
01:06:02,515 --> 01:06:04,507
Damn! Where are you?

1324
01:06:16,475 --> 01:06:17,670
Excuse me.

1325
01:06:23,755 --> 01:06:25,747
He's heading South on exchange place.

1326
01:06:28,155 --> 01:06:29,191
Stop!

1327
01:06:36,195 --> 01:06:37,515
What are you doing?

1328
01:06:40,995 --> 01:06:43,112
He's going in Napoleon house.

1329
01:06:45,155 --> 01:06:46,714
Move! Move!

1330
01:06:47,595 --> 01:06:49,109
Move out of the way!

1331
01:06:49,835 --> 01:06:50,825
Hey!

1332
01:06:51,675 --> 01:06:52,665
Move!

1333
01:06:54,995 --> 01:06:57,271
He's in the bathroom.
I have him in the bathroom.

1334
01:06:57,395 --> 01:06:59,671
No! No! No!

1335
01:07:01,555 --> 01:07:02,705
Freeze!

1336
01:07:03,555 --> 01:07:04,830
Lower your weapons!

1337
01:07:05,115 --> 01:07:06,185
What?

1338
01:07:06,435 --> 01:07:08,427
I'm tracking myself!

1339
01:07:08,955 --> 01:07:10,994
<i>The horsemen
left egg on the face of what they call</i>

1340
01:07:10,995 --> 01:07:12,634
<i>the alphabet agencies,</i>

1341
01:07:12,715 --> 01:07:13,910
<i>calling into question</i>

1342
01:07:14,035 --> 01:07:16,266
<i>the efficacy of the FBI's task force</i>

1343
01:07:16,395 --> 01:07:19,115
<i>as well as the man in charge
of the investigation,</i>

1344
01:07:19,195 --> 01:07:20,675
<i>special agent Dylan rhodes,</i>

1345
01:07:20,755 --> 01:07:22,394
<i>who was publicly ridiculed,</i>

1346
01:07:22,475 --> 01:07:25,354
<i>and even tackled at tonight's performance.</i>

1347
01:07:25,755 --> 01:07:26,984
<i>Talk about a fumble.</i>

1348
01:07:27,075 --> 01:07:28,907
<i>This is quickly becoming a national story,</i>

1349
01:07:29,195 --> 01:07:31,994
<i>as the horsemen have now
seemingly pulled off the impossible</i>

1350
01:07:32,195 --> 01:07:34,505
<i>for the second time in as many days.</i>

1351
01:07:34,755 --> 01:07:36,474
<i>Two nights ago in Vegas, the horsemen</i>

1352
01:07:36,595 --> 01:07:37,995
<i>seemingly robbed a bank in Paris...</i>

1353
01:07:38,275 --> 01:07:39,425
Hey.

1354
01:07:40,595 --> 01:07:41,711
What are you doing?

1355
01:07:41,795 --> 01:07:43,195
I'm having a drink.

1356
01:07:46,275 --> 01:07:47,629
I came to get you.

1357
01:07:48,235 --> 01:07:49,430
I'm worried about you.

1358
01:07:49,595 --> 01:07:51,109
You're worried about me.
Well, I'm worried about you.

1359
01:07:51,235 --> 01:07:52,351
Atlas. You had him.

1360
01:07:52,435 --> 01:07:53,664
He didn't have a weapon.

1361
01:07:53,755 --> 01:07:55,316
I couldn't shoot him and you know that.

1362
01:07:55,395 --> 01:07:58,229
Yeah, but you... you let him go.

1363
01:07:58,395 --> 01:07:59,590
Didn't you?

1364
01:08:00,195 --> 01:08:01,868
A pretty French girl
shows up out of the Blue,

1365
01:08:01,955 --> 01:08:03,674
acts like she's my partner
and then she lets the bad guy go?

1366
01:08:03,755 --> 01:08:04,871
Let go of my arm.

1367
01:08:04,955 --> 01:08:06,628
Who exactly are you anyway?

1368
01:08:08,795 --> 01:08:10,787
I thought you said you were a desk agent.

1369
01:08:15,835 --> 01:08:17,064
Not bad.

1370
01:08:18,995 --> 01:08:19,985
What is this?

1371
01:08:22,995 --> 01:08:24,475
What's the eye of horus?

1372
01:08:24,635 --> 01:08:27,628
Oh, certainly nothing
I want to get into tonight.

1373
01:08:27,755 --> 01:08:30,315
You're dismissive enough
about me when you're sober.

1374
01:08:30,795 --> 01:08:32,991
Find your way back yourself.

1375
01:08:36,995 --> 01:08:40,147
Mr. Bradley? Mr. Tressler would like you
to join him for a drink.

1376
01:08:49,595 --> 01:08:50,631
Sir.

1377
01:08:50,835 --> 01:08:52,064
Thank you.

1378
01:08:53,475 --> 01:08:55,671
What is your role with them?

1379
01:08:55,835 --> 01:08:56,825
Role?

1380
01:08:57,035 --> 01:08:58,755
Yes. You seem to know
everything about them.

1381
01:08:58,835 --> 01:09:00,636
What they're gonna do.
Where they're gonna be.

1382
01:09:00,835 --> 01:09:02,508
If it makes you feel any better,

1383
01:09:02,635 --> 01:09:03,830
this wasn't about you.

1384
01:09:03,915 --> 01:09:07,386
Please tell me why this was not about me.

1385
01:09:08,155 --> 01:09:10,715
This is a magic trick, Mr. Tressler.

1386
01:09:10,995 --> 01:09:13,305
Played out on a global scale.

1387
01:09:13,675 --> 01:09:17,635
You, sir, are the abracadabra.

1388
01:09:18,195 --> 01:09:20,994
The distraction, while they
set up the real trick.

1389
01:09:21,195 --> 01:09:25,348
I was a $140-million distraction?

1390
01:09:26,195 --> 01:09:27,345
Yes.

1391
01:09:28,035 --> 01:09:32,188
And that very ego that got you involved
with them in the first place

1392
01:09:32,675 --> 01:09:34,189
is what keeps you from seeing that.

1393
01:09:34,315 --> 01:09:35,874
- You know...
- "I can destroy you."

1394
01:09:35,995 --> 01:09:37,395
Yes, I do know.

1395
01:09:37,595 --> 01:09:38,870
Well, you won't.

1396
01:09:39,435 --> 01:09:41,586
And you won't destroy them.

1397
01:09:41,715 --> 01:09:43,752
Whatever this grand trick is,

1398
01:09:44,035 --> 01:09:46,834
it was designed a long time ago.

1399
01:09:47,035 --> 01:09:51,587
And I believe that what's about to follow
is really going to amaze.

1400
01:09:52,435 --> 01:09:56,987
So I suggest
you sit back and enjoy your front row seat.

1401
01:09:57,435 --> 01:10:00,109
You paid quite a lot of good money for it.

1402
01:10:00,315 --> 01:10:02,352
Whatever you stand to make

1403
01:10:04,475 --> 01:10:08,025
I'll double it, if you expose them now.

1404
01:10:08,235 --> 01:10:09,635
And destroy them.

1405
01:10:10,035 --> 01:10:12,027
I stand to make five million.

1406
01:10:12,755 --> 01:10:13,984
Am I flinching?

1407
01:10:16,115 --> 01:10:17,708
No, you're not.

1408
01:11:38,515 --> 01:11:39,631
Hey.

1409
01:11:40,995 --> 01:11:43,191
I'm sorry for your arm.

1410
01:11:43,275 --> 01:11:44,868
No. I'm sorry.

1411
01:11:44,955 --> 01:11:47,231
I was an asshole. I was drunk.

1412
01:11:49,195 --> 01:11:51,790
I'm at a loss.

1413
01:11:53,715 --> 01:11:59,109
You know, when merritt said I hardly spent
any time away from the desk, he was right.

1414
01:11:59,195 --> 01:12:02,472
I'm a researcher. That's what I do best.

1415
01:12:03,595 --> 01:12:07,475
So what's this all about?

1416
01:12:08,195 --> 01:12:10,869
Supposedly, if you buy into it,

1417
01:12:10,955 --> 01:12:12,309
the eye are the keepers

1418
01:12:12,395 --> 01:12:13,545
of real magic

1419
01:12:13,675 --> 01:12:16,588
and the protectors of
those who practice it.

1420
01:12:16,675 --> 01:12:18,587
"Candidates for initiations"

1421
01:12:18,675 --> 01:12:21,827
"must follow a series of commands
with blind obedience."

1422
01:12:22,835 --> 01:12:26,033
- This isn't real.
- But there are some who think it is.

1423
01:12:26,515 --> 01:12:28,029
May I?

1424
01:12:29,835 --> 01:12:34,148
According to this,
they only take new people twice a century.

1425
01:12:34,235 --> 01:12:37,626
So what? The horsemen are doing these
shows in order to get into this thing?

1426
01:12:37,715 --> 01:12:38,915
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

1427
01:12:39,035 --> 01:12:44,030
I mean, I guess these guys
could just rob banks to rob banks.

1428
01:12:44,115 --> 01:12:46,425
They don't have to put on a show for that.

1429
01:12:46,515 --> 01:12:48,029
It's probably just a myth.

1430
01:12:48,115 --> 01:12:52,234
But it doesn't make any sense, and I don't
think logic will solve this for us.

1431
01:12:52,315 --> 01:12:54,910
- You don't say?
- No.

1432
01:12:56,155 --> 01:13:00,786
I believe
that some things are only discovered

1433
01:13:00,875 --> 01:13:05,233
if you take certain leaps.

1434
01:13:12,275 --> 01:13:15,393
- Well, I gotta get to...
- Yeah. Yeah.

1435
01:13:15,475 --> 01:13:17,626
- Thanks. Good night.
- Yeah. Good night.

1436
01:13:17,715 --> 01:13:19,513
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

1437
01:13:22,035 --> 01:13:25,472
If the eye did exist, we'd have to assume
they were watching us, right?

1438
01:13:25,555 --> 01:13:26,784
Shit.

1439
01:13:26,915 --> 01:13:29,510
I think someone is watching us,
but it isn't magic.

1440
01:13:29,595 --> 01:13:32,554
Your fears are correct.
This is not and has never been your phone.

1441
01:13:32,635 --> 01:13:37,346
It's a clone in every way, except for this.

1442
01:13:37,435 --> 01:13:38,755
A bug.

1443
01:13:38,835 --> 01:13:42,670
Someone has
heard every call, read every text.

1444
01:13:42,915 --> 01:13:44,110
That's how
they were able to stay ahead of us.

1445
01:13:44,235 --> 01:13:45,066
God damn it!

1446
01:13:46,435 --> 01:13:48,188
Get me atlas' interrogation tape.

1447
01:13:48,555 --> 01:13:50,075
Yes, sir. I have it on the hard drive.

1448
01:13:51,915 --> 01:13:52,985
Picture's up.

1449
01:13:53,475 --> 01:13:55,228
Okay, fast forward.

1450
01:13:55,595 --> 01:13:57,029
Go on, go on. Freeze!

1451
01:13:57,835 --> 01:13:59,633
Okay. Frame by frame. Go on.

1452
01:14:00,515 --> 01:14:01,551
Play it through.

1453
01:14:02,675 --> 01:14:04,985
Stop. Zoom in tighter. Tighter.

1454
01:14:05,435 --> 01:14:07,233
There. That's where he took my phone.

1455
01:14:08,515 --> 01:14:09,665
Is that thing transmitting?

1456
01:14:09,875 --> 01:14:11,275
Only when
you're making a call or sending a text.

1457
01:14:11,475 --> 01:14:12,431
Plus I removed the bug.

1458
01:14:12,515 --> 01:14:14,074
All right. Put it back in
and turn on the phone.

1459
01:14:14,315 --> 01:14:16,113
They don't know
that we know about the bug.

1460
01:14:16,315 --> 01:14:18,307
As of this instant, we are ahead of them.

1461
01:14:18,395 --> 01:14:20,512
We need to keep it that way. Understand?

1462
01:14:20,955 --> 01:14:22,275
Find my real phone and track it.

1463
01:14:22,355 --> 01:14:25,712
Already did. As of about 20 minutes ago,
it's in New York City.

1464
01:14:25,915 --> 01:14:26,951
Good.

1465
01:14:27,315 --> 01:14:29,034
I wanna cut 'em off at the knees.

1466
01:14:29,115 --> 01:14:30,185
They got power? Cut it.

1467
01:14:30,435 --> 01:14:33,712
They got phones, electricity, water?
Cut it.

1468
01:14:33,915 --> 01:14:34,951
Squeeze 'em out.

1469
01:14:35,035 --> 01:14:36,788
I want 'em to feel our presence.

1470
01:14:36,875 --> 01:14:38,389
And get me an airplane!

1471
01:14:41,155 --> 01:14:42,953
The firewall's down.
Do they know about this?

1472
01:14:43,075 --> 01:14:44,031
They who?

1473
01:14:44,115 --> 01:14:45,868
"They," "them," whoever we're working for.

1474
01:14:46,115 --> 01:14:47,265
Who are we working for?

1475
01:14:47,395 --> 01:14:49,466
And are we prepared to go to jail for them?

1476
01:14:49,555 --> 01:14:50,545
Stop being paranoid.

1477
01:14:50,755 --> 01:14:51,871
It really does happen.

1478
01:14:52,075 --> 01:14:53,634
It happened to you.
Doesn't mean it's gonna happen to us.

1479
01:14:53,795 --> 01:14:55,354
Guys, I don't know if
can do this, all right.

1480
01:14:55,435 --> 01:14:56,755
I don't want to go to jail, you know?

1481
01:14:56,835 --> 01:14:58,588
Then don't screw up.
You're always talking about

1482
01:14:58,715 --> 01:14:59,910
wanting to be treated like an adult.

1483
01:14:59,995 --> 01:15:01,145
Now might be a good time
to start acting like one.

1484
01:15:01,235 --> 01:15:03,386
Stick to the plan. Stay
here and burn it all.

1485
01:15:16,515 --> 01:15:17,836
I don't know what I'm doing here.

1486
01:15:17,915 --> 01:15:18,871
I don't know
what you would do anywhere else.

1487
01:15:18,955 --> 01:15:21,424
I'm here for the pot of gold
at the end of the rainbow.

1488
01:15:21,755 --> 01:15:23,872
That's it. Then I'm gone.

1489
01:15:23,955 --> 01:15:26,156
You can do whatever you want
when this is over, merritt.

1490
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:28,472
But until then, you stick to the plan.

1491
01:15:28,555 --> 01:15:30,592
Hey, guys. They're here.

1492
01:15:32,435 --> 01:15:34,427
- My guys are ready to go.
- Let's do this quickly...

1493
01:15:34,515 --> 01:15:35,835
- No.
- What?

1494
01:15:35,915 --> 01:15:37,354
She doesn't have jurisdiction here.

1495
01:15:37,355 --> 01:15:38,584
She's interpol. She's with me.

1496
01:15:38,715 --> 01:15:39,705
She stays.

1497
01:15:39,795 --> 01:15:41,070
What? What?

1498
01:15:41,155 --> 01:15:42,145
Stay in the car.

1499
01:15:44,395 --> 01:15:45,624
Let's go.

1500
01:15:51,235 --> 01:15:52,271
Okay. Let's do it.

1501
01:15:56,755 --> 01:15:57,745
FBI!

1502
01:16:01,995 --> 01:16:03,349
Ladies first.

1503
01:16:03,915 --> 01:16:05,144
Don't move!

1504
01:16:11,195 --> 01:16:12,629
Tell me.

1505
01:16:12,715 --> 01:16:14,468
Is my money being well-spent?

1506
01:16:14,995 --> 01:16:16,907
Exceedingly well.

1507
01:16:18,635 --> 01:16:20,149
Now you tell me,

1508
01:16:20,955 --> 01:16:22,628
how do you like your horsemen?

1509
01:16:22,795 --> 01:16:24,832
Fricasseed or fried?

1510
01:16:25,075 --> 01:16:26,111
Shredded.

1511
01:16:27,195 --> 01:16:28,675
I'll tell the chef.

1512
01:17:44,235 --> 01:17:45,225
Freeze!

1513
01:17:52,395 --> 01:17:53,385
Dylan!

1514
01:17:54,355 --> 01:17:55,550
Hold on!

1515
01:17:57,875 --> 01:17:58,911
You little...

1516
01:18:03,435 --> 01:18:04,425
Come here!

1517
01:18:06,195 --> 01:18:08,107
Five is clear. Standing by for six.

1518
01:18:08,315 --> 01:18:10,546
You little shit!

1519
01:18:10,635 --> 01:18:12,876
- What game are you playing?
- What game are you playing?

1520
01:18:13,195 --> 01:18:15,232
We're all good at six. Move to seven.

1521
01:18:15,315 --> 01:18:17,352
Copy that. Going to seven. Go, go, go!

1522
01:18:18,035 --> 01:18:20,027
No, no, no, no, no. Go back!

1523
01:18:20,595 --> 01:18:21,711
Hey!

1524
01:18:23,475 --> 01:18:24,704
Come here!

1525
01:18:55,715 --> 01:18:56,831
Come here!

1526
01:18:56,955 --> 01:18:58,628
All right, hold on, hold on!

1527
01:19:00,555 --> 01:19:02,387
- Really?
- Yup.

1528
01:19:06,555 --> 01:19:07,545
You...

1529
01:19:11,395 --> 01:19:12,875
You little...

1530
01:19:28,915 --> 01:19:29,951
Shit!

1531
01:19:48,355 --> 01:19:49,391
Shit!

1532
01:19:50,795 --> 01:19:52,149
Give me that!

1533
01:20:18,155 --> 01:20:20,112
<i>All units, cover the north exit now!</i>

1534
01:20:20,195 --> 01:20:21,470
Clear on Evan.

1535
01:20:21,555 --> 01:20:23,387
<i>Block every possible exit.</i>

1536
01:20:23,475 --> 01:20:24,989
Hey! Get back. Shit.

1537
01:20:26,475 --> 01:20:28,592
- FBI. Sort of. I need your car. Thanks.
- What?

1538
01:20:28,675 --> 01:20:29,711
What?

1539
01:20:30,715 --> 01:20:33,025
- Elvis, help me out, bud.
- Thank you very much.

1540
01:20:33,235 --> 01:20:35,795
In Jack's bowl
are ping pong balls with section numbers.

1541
01:20:35,875 --> 01:20:37,867
Jack, could you hand me a section number?

1542
01:20:38,075 --> 01:20:39,555
Thank you. We are looking at section B.

1543
01:20:39,635 --> 01:20:40,785
Where is section B?

1544
01:20:41,475 --> 01:20:43,944
Okay. There. It's gonna be
one of you guys. Get ready.

1545
01:20:44,475 --> 01:20:45,795
I don't know why everybody's happy.

1546
01:20:45,875 --> 01:20:46,911
It's only them.

1547
01:20:47,195 --> 01:20:48,788
Merritt, can I get a row, please?

1548
01:20:50,875 --> 01:20:52,514
Stop! Stop!

1549
01:21:08,635 --> 01:21:09,671
Hey!

1550
01:21:39,515 --> 01:21:40,426
Good. Follow him!

1551
01:21:40,555 --> 01:21:42,592
Don't ever tell me to
stay in the car. Ever.

1552
01:21:42,675 --> 01:21:44,029
I didn't have tactical command.

1553
01:21:44,115 --> 01:21:46,471
If you don't trust me, just tell me.

1554
01:21:46,555 --> 01:21:48,148
Promise me, next time, you will back me up.

1555
01:21:48,235 --> 01:21:50,272
Could we have
this conversation later, please?

1556
01:21:50,355 --> 01:21:51,948
No!

1557
01:21:52,035 --> 01:21:54,266
Okay, fine, I promise. Now, go!

1558
01:22:01,755 --> 01:22:04,224
- Where'd they go?
- Where are they?

1559
01:22:04,315 --> 01:22:06,074
I don't know. She just took some guy's car.

1560
01:22:06,075 --> 01:22:07,634
- Where are they?
- That way. That way.

1561
01:22:07,635 --> 01:22:08,675
- Is that your car?
- Yeah.

1562
01:22:08,755 --> 01:22:10,189
Let's go.

1563
01:22:35,835 --> 01:22:36,825
There he is!

1564
01:22:48,715 --> 01:22:49,705
Move!

1565
01:22:54,075 --> 01:22:55,111
Left!

1566
01:22:57,475 --> 01:22:59,273
We're heading east on the fdr drive.

1567
01:22:59,355 --> 01:23:01,187
- This is not east.
- North! North!

1568
01:23:01,275 --> 01:23:03,312
- We're heading north on the fdr drive.
- What?

1569
01:23:03,395 --> 01:23:05,466
<i>We're coming to you live above the fdr,</i>

1570
01:23:05,555 --> 01:23:08,468
<i>where NYPD
and federal agents, as you now see,</i>

1571
01:23:08,555 --> 01:23:10,467
<i>are engaged in a high-speed pursuit,</i>

1572
01:23:10,555 --> 01:23:11,830
<i>following a black sedan.</i>

1573
01:23:16,995 --> 01:23:17,985
<i>Fuller, where are you?</i>

1574
01:23:18,235 --> 01:23:20,033
Right here. Trying to catch up to you now.

1575
01:23:20,115 --> 01:23:22,152
<i>We're now trying to get you a better shot.</i>

1576
01:23:24,675 --> 01:23:25,745
Come on!

1577
01:23:41,515 --> 01:23:42,714
<i>It looks like they're turning</i>

1578
01:23:42,715 --> 01:23:44,832
<i>onto the 59th street bridge.</i>

1579
01:23:46,875 --> 01:23:48,468
<i>As soon as we have them within range,</i>

1580
01:23:48,555 --> 01:23:50,387
<i>we will bring you those pictures live.</i>

1581
01:23:55,915 --> 01:23:57,110
Good. Just stay with him.

1582
01:24:04,475 --> 01:24:05,750
Go, go, go!

1583
01:24:09,755 --> 01:24:11,269
Behind... you're behind the bus!

1584
01:24:14,875 --> 01:24:15,911
Get over!

1585
01:24:19,515 --> 01:24:20,551
Oh, shit!

1586
01:24:44,235 --> 01:24:45,225
Come here!

1587
01:24:46,475 --> 01:24:47,909
Get back! Get back!

1588
01:24:49,395 --> 01:24:50,715
Dylan, let's go, man!

1589
01:24:50,915 --> 01:24:51,905
Come on, you...

1590
01:24:53,435 --> 01:24:55,472
- Come on, man! Get out!
- He's gonna die in here.

1591
01:24:55,555 --> 01:24:56,909
Leave him! There's nothing you can do!

1592
01:24:56,995 --> 01:24:58,907
Let's go! Leave him!

1593
01:25:03,715 --> 01:25:05,115
- The paper!
- Dylan!

1594
01:25:05,355 --> 01:25:07,267
Let's go! Let's go! Come on!

1595
01:25:32,475 --> 01:25:36,708
<i>Today, the unfolding story of a popular

01:26:01,675 --> 01:26:04,349
Dylan, they just figured out what
the paper was in Jack's car.

1603
01:26:04,435 --> 01:26:05,755
So they know what it is?

1604
01:26:05,835 --> 01:26:07,515
And why the kid died trying to protect it.

1605
01:26:07,635 --> 01:26:09,354
Evans is on his way to brief us right now.

1606
01:26:09,355 --> 01:26:10,914
Let's go.

1607
01:26:10,995 --> 01:26:12,270
You're gonna wanna take this first, though.

1608
01:26:12,355 --> 01:26:13,345
What's that?

1609
01:26:13,475 --> 01:26:15,751
Your friend thaddeus Bradley.

1610
01:26:16,235 --> 01:26:17,510
Rhodes.

1611
01:26:17,595 --> 01:26:19,188
You do understand the function

1612
01:26:19,275 --> 01:26:21,426
of the magician's assistant,
don't you, agent rhodes?

1613
01:26:21,755 --> 01:26:23,235
Yeah, she's there to distract them

1614
01:26:23,315 --> 01:26:24,510
while he sets up the trick.

1615
01:26:24,635 --> 01:26:25,785
I'm going to go with her.

1616
01:26:25,955 --> 01:26:27,556
Go. I got your back. I'll be right here.

1617
01:26:29,035 --> 01:26:30,105
Go ahead!

1618
01:26:30,195 --> 01:26:31,675
That's on you, Fuller.

1619
01:26:47,075 --> 01:26:51,115
Let's go, let's go! Now, now, now!

1620
01:27:02,195 --> 01:27:03,311
Daniel?

1621
01:27:04,635 --> 01:27:06,786
You'd be right if you weren't so wrong.

1622
01:27:07,235 --> 01:27:08,954
<i>While you're watching the magician,</i>

1623
01:27:09,795 --> 01:27:12,071
<i>that lovely innocent
is actually pulling the strings.</i>

1624
01:27:12,275 --> 01:27:15,393
<i>Don't you find it peculiar
that interpol would send you</i>

1625
01:27:15,475 --> 01:27:18,946
a first timer off the desk
to be your assistant?

1626
01:27:19,395 --> 01:27:21,546
Why did she request to be put on the case?

1627
01:27:21,995 --> 01:27:23,907
She was assigned to the case.

1628
01:27:24,795 --> 01:27:26,149
Luck of the draw.

1629
01:27:26,755 --> 01:27:29,827
Like choosing a random card in the deck.

1630
01:27:29,995 --> 01:27:33,591
I find it odd, your
sudden act of generosity.

1631
01:27:33,675 --> 01:27:34,791
What's in it for you?

1632
01:27:34,955 --> 01:27:36,787
Just trying to even the game.

1633
01:27:36,995 --> 01:27:40,989
I feel like I'm playing with somebody
wearing ankle weights and flippers.

1634
01:27:42,155 --> 01:27:45,910
Keep up, agent rhodes. Keep up.

1635
01:27:49,755 --> 01:27:50,825
Hey.

1636
01:27:51,155 --> 01:27:52,350
We got a problem.

1637
01:27:53,515 --> 01:27:54,585
Here's the safe.

1638
01:27:54,675 --> 01:27:56,155
No, no, no. Hey.

1639
01:27:56,235 --> 01:27:57,510
What's he doing here?

1640
01:27:57,675 --> 01:27:59,268
Giving us our first solid lead.

1641
01:27:59,355 --> 01:28:01,233
We've been investigating
a private security contractor

1642
01:28:01,315 --> 01:28:02,465
called Elkhorn

1643
01:28:02,555 --> 01:28:04,512
- for the last five years.
- And?

1644
01:28:04,595 --> 01:28:06,268
They've been hiding close
to a half billion dollars...

1645
01:28:06,355 --> 01:28:08,824
I didn't ask you. I asked him.

1646
01:28:09,195 --> 01:28:11,505
The money's in a vault inside
a warehouse in queens.

1647
01:28:11,715 --> 01:28:14,184
We think this vault
is your magicians' final target.

1648
01:28:14,355 --> 01:28:16,267
The magician who died on the bridge...

1649
01:28:16,355 --> 01:28:19,826
You pulled our classified Elkhorn file
right from his crispy little hand.

1650
01:28:20,195 --> 01:28:22,235
And despite their bullshit
Robin hood razzle-dazzle,

1651
01:28:22,515 --> 01:28:24,393
your magicians are nothing
more than common thieves.

1652
01:28:24,475 --> 01:28:25,670
How did they get the file?

1653
01:28:26,955 --> 01:28:27,945
This is the part you're gonna find

1654
01:28:28,035 --> 01:28:29,992
particularly interesting, agent rhodes.

1655
01:28:30,235 --> 01:28:32,511
They patched to my server
after they accessed

1656
01:28:32,595 --> 01:28:34,871
your mobile command center
in new Orleans

1657
01:28:34,955 --> 01:28:36,548
with codes they got from your phone.

1658
01:28:38,715 --> 01:28:40,547
You ordered us all out to chase after them.

1659
01:28:40,995 --> 01:28:43,555
The level of incompetence
displayed on this case,

1660
01:28:43,635 --> 01:28:46,150
that's a magic trick in and of itself.

1661
01:28:46,235 --> 01:28:48,466
Abracadabra. I'm taking over.

1662
01:28:49,915 --> 01:28:51,827
Boss, he's taking over?

1663
01:28:52,355 --> 01:28:54,347
Let's go, gentlemen.

1664
01:28:55,755 --> 01:28:57,109
Hey.

1665
01:28:57,195 --> 01:28:58,675
Hey. I want to have a word with you.

1666
01:28:58,755 --> 01:28:59,905
Don't ever talk to me like that again.

1667
01:28:59,995 --> 01:29:02,032
- Why the hell did you take this case?
- What?

1668
01:29:02,115 --> 01:29:04,266
People say I'm "hard to read."
That's an American expression.

1669
01:29:04,395 --> 01:29:05,795
Do you understand it?

1670
01:29:05,875 --> 01:29:06,911
Yes.

1671
01:29:07,035 --> 01:29:09,311
Good, then let me make myself
perfectly clear to you.

1672
01:29:09,395 --> 01:29:11,751
If I find out that you
are anything other than

1673
01:29:11,835 --> 01:29:13,110
who you say you are, I swear...

1674
01:29:13,275 --> 01:29:15,028
And we French also have an expression.

1675
01:29:16,875 --> 01:29:18,548
"Faith can move mountains."

1676
01:29:18,635 --> 01:29:20,308
If we hope to capture the horsemen,

1677
01:29:20,395 --> 01:29:22,227
then you need to have a little faith in me.

1678
01:29:22,475 --> 01:29:24,467
Because I've done nothing
to deserve otherwise.

1679
01:29:24,555 --> 01:29:27,309
I just got my ass handed to me.

1680
01:29:27,395 --> 01:29:28,954
I am losing this case.

1681
01:29:29,035 --> 01:29:32,346
So faith is a luxury
I don't have any time for right now.

1682
01:29:38,595 --> 01:29:40,791
<i>More than anything in his life,</i>

1683
01:29:40,875 --> 01:29:46,234
Jack wanted to be
the most famous magician who ever lived.

1684
01:29:46,315 --> 01:29:47,715
And I can't say he achieved it,

1685
01:29:47,795 --> 01:29:51,755
but I do hope wherever he is,
it is full of magic.

1686
01:29:53,515 --> 01:29:55,825
But the point is... sorry.

1687
01:29:55,915 --> 01:29:57,395
The point is...

1688
01:29:57,475 --> 01:30:03,665
The point of why we are here is to say
that we are not... we cannot quit now.

1689
01:30:03,755 --> 01:30:06,315
<i>We've started something
bigger than all of us.</i>

1690
01:30:06,395 --> 01:30:08,227
<i>We have to finish it.</i>

1691
01:30:17,275 --> 01:30:18,345
<i>Approaching the warehouse.</i>

1692
01:30:18,435 --> 01:30:20,950
<i>Units 5 and 6
cover the north and South entrances.</i>

1693
01:30:21,035 --> 01:30:22,264
<i>We are going for the vault.</i>

1694
01:30:27,395 --> 01:30:30,308
Hey. Where's the safe? Where's the safe?

1695
01:30:34,475 --> 01:30:35,465
What is this?

1696
01:30:35,555 --> 01:30:36,994
Where the hell is the goddamn safe?

1697
01:30:36,995 --> 01:30:38,873
We just moved it while you were outside.

1698
01:30:38,955 --> 01:30:40,150
- Evans' orders.
- What?

1699
01:30:40,235 --> 01:30:41,271
I never said that.

1700
01:30:41,355 --> 01:30:42,675
Sir, you got a phone call

1701
01:30:42,795 --> 01:30:44,474
and said Washington wants the safe moved.

1702
01:30:44,475 --> 01:30:46,546
You never heard that
come out of my mouth, agent.

1703
01:30:46,635 --> 01:30:47,307
What happened?

1704
01:30:47,835 --> 01:30:50,111
You tell me what's going on,
because this is bullshit!

1705
01:30:50,195 --> 01:30:51,265
No!

1706
01:30:57,155 --> 01:30:58,669
Jesus Christ.

1707
01:30:58,875 --> 01:31:01,834
Sir? Sir? What are you doing?

1708
01:31:01,915 --> 01:31:03,793
<i>I think it's Beethoven's
concerto in d-major.</i>

1709
01:31:03,875 --> 01:31:04,865
Where's the safe?

1710
01:31:04,955 --> 01:31:06,155
His team is loading the truck.

1711
01:31:10,355 --> 01:31:11,994
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey!

1712
01:31:13,555 --> 01:31:14,705
- Stop the truck!
- Stop!

1713
01:31:15,715 --> 01:31:17,866
- Stop!
- Hey! Stop that truck!

1714
01:31:26,515 --> 01:31:28,393
What the hell's going on?
We got our orders.

1715
01:31:28,475 --> 01:31:30,228
Now you've got new orders. Open it up.

1716
01:31:34,195 --> 01:31:35,993
Okay. Here's what I want.

1717
01:31:36,075 --> 01:31:38,316
At this moment,
they think that safe's leaving this site.

1718
01:31:38,555 --> 01:31:39,705
So we stay with it.

1719
01:31:39,795 --> 01:31:41,707
We follow it
all the way to... where's it going?

1720
01:31:41,955 --> 01:31:43,025
5 points. Up the street.

1721
01:31:43,475 --> 01:31:46,354
So we go to 5 points.
Wherever the safe goes, we go.

1722
01:31:46,595 --> 01:31:47,676
It'll lead us right to 'em.

1723
01:31:48,595 --> 01:31:49,745
You two are with me.

1724
01:32:02,395 --> 01:32:03,624
Guys.

1725
01:32:04,595 --> 01:32:07,110
Look. Office just called with this.

1726
01:32:07,195 --> 01:32:09,073
Horsemen posted it to YouTube
20 minutes ago.

1727
01:32:09,435 --> 01:32:13,031
<i>The point of why we're here

1728
01:32:13,275 --> 01:32:15,107

<i>Remember the name Jack Wilder

<i>5 points, queens, 7:00.</i>

1733
01:32:24,355 --> 01:32:25,425
Their show is in a half an hour.

1734
01:32:25,555 --> 01:32:26,835
It's exactly where we're headed.

1735
01:32:26,955 --> 01:32:29,072
I don't know, boss.
I don't wanna be the naysayer,

1736
01:32:29,275 --> 01:32:31,232
but these guys are kinda tricky.

1737
01:32:31,315 --> 01:32:33,955
Rhodes, they're entertainers.

1738
01:32:36,475 --> 01:32:38,626
<i>A stunning turnout here in 5 points</i>

1739
01:32:38,715 --> 01:32:42,550
<i>as the renegade horsemen
taunt the FBI into a final showdown.</i>

1740
01:32:42,635 --> 01:32:44,035
<i>The horsemen have invited
us to their final round</i>

1741

<i>What do they have in store?
We're about to find out.</i>

1743
01:33:01,475 --> 01:33:03,751
<i>All eyes on the truck.
Let's see who approaches.</i>

1744
01:33:03,835 --> 01:33:05,155
Copy that.

1745
01:33:21,355 --> 01:33:23,187
<i>Agents rhodes, Fuller?</i>

1746
01:33:23,835 --> 01:33:24,825
Go, for us.

1747
01:33:24,995 --> 01:33:27,635
We've got movement.
Someone's walking toward the truck.

1748
01:33:27,755 --> 01:33:29,235
<i>It's a woman.</i>

1749
01:33:32,995 --> 01:33:34,145
- Freeze!
- Oh, shit!

1750
01:33:35,955 --> 01:33:37,435
What the hell's going on?

1751
01:33:38,515 --> 01:33:40,871
Hey! It's the guy from the TV.

1752
01:33:40,955 --> 01:33:41,991
Put your guns down.

1753
01:33:42,195 --> 01:33:45,029
Look who it is. The fifth horseman.

1754
01:33:45,195 --> 01:33:46,185
Are you kidding?

1755
01:33:46,275 --> 01:33:48,107
I'm following them, just like you are.

1756
01:33:48,195 --> 01:33:49,788
I'm not following anybody anymore.

1757
01:33:49,875 --> 01:33:51,628
You've been ahead of us this whole time.

1758
01:33:51,715 --> 01:33:53,308
But guess what? I'm ahead of you now.

1759
01:33:53,555 --> 01:33:55,148
Your ass is mine.

1760
01:33:55,395 --> 01:33:57,114
You guys are still idiots.

1761
01:33:57,355 --> 01:33:58,391
Yeah?

1762
01:33:58,475 --> 01:33:59,674
This happens to be the former

1763
01:33:59,675 --> 01:34:01,712
rehearsal space for Lionel shrike.

1764
01:34:02,155 --> 01:34:03,987
It's where I did my first show.

1765
01:34:04,235 --> 01:34:06,989
Now, if you wanna look
like even bigger idiots,

1766
01:34:07,235 --> 01:34:08,464
why not open it?

1767
01:34:08,835 --> 01:34:10,474
And while you're doing it, agent rhodes,

1768
01:34:10,755 --> 01:34:12,394
would you mind reenacting your look

1769
01:34:12,595 --> 01:34:14,507
of absolute befuddlement for me?

1770
01:34:14,675 --> 01:34:16,746
It will make a wonderful cover for my DVD.

1771
01:34:18,115 --> 01:34:19,344
Open the safe.

1772
01:34:19,435 --> 01:34:20,949
- Go ahead.
- Open it.

1773
01:34:25,275 --> 01:34:26,311
What the hell?

1774
01:34:28,755 --> 01:34:29,825
What?

1775
01:34:30,075 --> 01:34:31,145
Give me that.

1776
01:34:31,355 --> 01:34:32,391
No.

1777
01:34:32,595 --> 01:34:33,585
No!

1778
01:34:38,195 --> 01:34:39,231
What is this?

1779
01:34:40,395 --> 01:34:41,385
Get back!

1780
01:34:48,955 --> 01:34:51,106
Who doesn't love a good magic trick?

1781
01:34:51,755 --> 01:34:54,111
They have you chasing empty safes again.

1782
01:34:55,435 --> 01:34:58,587
Once again, misdirection.

1783
01:35:05,555 --> 01:35:07,194
The show is starting. Move out!

1784
01:35:07,275 --> 01:35:09,790
The question
I'd be asking now, agent rhodes is,

1785
01:35:10,275 --> 01:35:12,392
"what happened to the real one?"

1786
01:35:33,075 --> 01:35:34,794
Clear! Clear 'em out!

1787
01:35:34,875 --> 01:35:36,716
Come on. Move 'em out.
Move 'em out of the way.

1788
01:35:37,875 --> 01:35:39,753
FBI! Give me a path!

1789
01:35:40,395 --> 01:35:41,988
Clear out! Clear out!

1790
01:35:42,235 --> 01:35:43,589
<i>What is magic?</i>

1791
01:35:44,435 --> 01:35:45,471
<i>Magic is deception.</i>

1792
01:35:45,595 --> 01:35:47,314
<i>But deception designed to delight,</i>

1793
01:35:47,555 --> 01:35:49,228
<i>to entertain, to inspire.</i>

1794
01:35:49,435 --> 01:35:51,791
Look out! Clear! Clear! Look out!

1795
01:35:52,155 --> 01:35:53,225
<i>It is about belief.</i>

1796
01:35:53,315 --> 01:35:54,305
<i>Faith.</i>

1797
01:35:54,435 --> 01:35:55,425
<i>Trust.</i>

1798
01:35:59,475 --> 01:36:00,829
<i>Without those qualities,</i>

1799
01:36:00,915 --> 01:36:04,352
<i>magic, as an art form,
would no longer exist.</i>

1800
01:36:04,915 --> 01:36:06,747
<i>But what happens if these qualities</i>

1801
01:36:06,955 --> 01:36:08,912
<i>are not used for their higher purpose?</i>

1802
01:36:09,115 --> 01:36:11,914
<i>And instead they're used to cheat, lie.</i>

1803
01:36:12,155 --> 01:36:14,351
<i>For personal gain or for greed.</i>

1804
01:36:14,515 --> 01:36:16,188
<i>Then it's no longer magic.</i>

1805
01:36:16,355 --> 01:36:17,425
<i>It's crime.</i>

1806
01:36:17,635 --> 01:36:20,628
<i>So tonight, for our final act,</i>

1807
01:36:20,715 --> 01:36:23,549
<i>you're gonna help us set
a few things right.</i>

1808
01:36:27,675 --> 01:36:28,870
What's going on here, rhodes?

1809
01:36:29,115 --> 01:36:30,265
I don't know.

1810
01:36:31,355 --> 01:36:32,505
Showtime.

1811
01:36:37,715 --> 01:36:38,705
Look!

1812
01:36:43,035 --> 01:36:44,947
There they are on the roof. Let's move!

1813
01:36:45,035 --> 01:36:46,355
Go, go, go!

1814
01:36:47,035 --> 01:36:48,389
- Dylan!
- FBI, coming through!

1815
01:36:49,955 --> 01:36:50,991
What are you doing here?

1816
01:36:51,115 --> 01:36:52,231
They're going in the wrong direction

1817
01:36:52,355 --> 01:36:53,391
and you know it.

1818
01:36:53,675 --> 01:36:55,985
Rhodes! I need all personnel now!

1819
01:36:56,155 --> 01:36:59,466
You need to trust me.
Take your leap of faith.

1820
01:37:00,315 --> 01:37:01,385
Wait.

1821
01:37:02,315 --> 01:37:03,465
Yeah?

1822
01:37:03,595 --> 01:37:08,226
As our, let's call it,
year of living dangerously

1823
01:37:08,435 --> 01:37:11,792
comes to a close,
in a rare moment of vulnerability,

1824
01:37:11,995 --> 01:37:14,669
I'd like to express a sentiment

1825
01:37:14,755 --> 01:37:16,314
to you about our relationship.

1826
01:37:16,595 --> 01:37:17,631
Okay.

1827
01:37:17,995 --> 01:37:21,511
Well, when I first met you,
I thought you were kind of a

1828
01:37:23,315 --> 01:37:24,305
dick.

1829
01:37:25,835 --> 01:37:26,871
And?

1830
01:37:28,675 --> 01:37:30,348
No, that's it.

1831
01:37:30,595 --> 01:37:31,585
That's very nice.

1832
01:37:31,675 --> 01:37:33,189
- Yeah.
- I'm touched.

1833
01:37:33,355 --> 01:37:34,789
Yeah. Just from the heart.

1834
01:37:34,995 --> 01:37:36,588
Well, I didn't tell you
where I was touched.

1835
01:37:36,715 --> 01:37:37,751
Oh, you!

1836
01:37:41,355 --> 01:37:43,274
Oh, God.
What are we gonna do when this is over?

1837
01:37:43,275 --> 01:37:44,345
We're on our own.

1838
01:37:44,435 --> 01:37:46,108
Our instructions run out after the show.

1839
01:37:47,035 --> 01:37:48,913
Even if there is no "eye,"

1840
01:37:48,995 --> 01:37:50,668
if we were completely played and we spend

1841
01:37:50,835 --> 01:37:52,827
the next 20 years in jail, then,

1842
01:37:53,355 --> 01:37:55,028
I just want to say that...

1843
01:37:55,275 --> 01:37:57,665
I know. Me, too.

1844
01:37:58,995 --> 01:38:00,907
Little too sentimental for me.

1845
01:38:07,875 --> 01:38:08,945
There they are!

1846
01:38:11,955 --> 01:38:14,709
Go grab 'em! Put 'em down! Go, go, go!

1847
01:38:14,835 --> 01:38:15,825
Grab 'em!

1848
01:38:20,835 --> 01:38:21,871
Get up!

1849
01:38:22,355 --> 01:38:23,505
What the hell?

1850
01:38:27,315 --> 01:38:28,465
Shit!

1851
01:38:37,715 --> 01:38:38,944
Hello, New York!

1852
01:38:47,435 --> 01:38:49,392
Thank you for the magic.

1853
01:38:49,595 --> 01:38:50,754
And thank you for being such

1854
01:38:50,755 --> 01:38:53,748
an incredible and dedicated audience.

1855
01:38:54,155 --> 01:38:56,192
Unfortunately, like all good things,

1856
01:38:56,275 --> 01:38:58,028
it must come to an end.

1857
01:39:00,755 --> 01:39:03,270
So we would like to start
our show tonight...

1858
01:39:03,355 --> 01:39:04,869
By saying goodbye.

1859
01:39:06,275 --> 01:39:07,595
All we wanted was to

1860
01:39:07,675 --> 01:39:09,632
bring the world to a magic show.

1861
01:39:09,715 --> 01:39:11,195
And thereby bring a little magic

1862
01:39:11,275 --> 01:39:12,425
back to the world.

1863
01:39:16,435 --> 01:39:17,585
Clear the way!

1864
01:39:27,355 --> 01:39:30,587
This has been
one hell of a ride for all of us.

1865
01:39:31,115 --> 01:39:33,471
But it's time for us to disappear.

1866
01:39:33,635 --> 01:39:34,955
Good night, New York.

1867
01:39:35,195 --> 01:39:36,629
And thank you for believing in us.

1868
01:39:39,315 --> 01:39:40,431
Stop!

1869
01:39:43,915 --> 01:39:44,905
Freeze!

1870
01:39:45,355 --> 01:39:46,505
No!

1871
01:40:04,635 --> 01:40:05,910
God damn it!

1872
01:40:34,515 --> 01:40:35,710
I'm sorry.

1873
01:40:36,395 --> 01:40:38,387
You were right. It's bigger than all of us.

1874
01:40:39,355 --> 01:40:43,429
This is one time I'm not happy being right.

1875
01:40:45,795 --> 01:40:47,388
So I guess this is it.

1876
01:40:49,475 --> 01:40:50,625
Is it?

1877
01:41:16,715 --> 01:41:18,035
Dylan!

1878
01:41:18,395 --> 01:41:20,864
Dylan! Dylan!

1879
01:41:20,955 --> 01:41:21,991
Hey.

1880
01:41:23,315 --> 01:41:25,272
- You see that?
- What?

1881
01:41:28,915 --> 01:41:30,269
Where's the real money?

1882
01:41:46,515 --> 01:41:50,475
You're under arrest! Hands in the air! Now!

1883
01:41:54,675 --> 01:41:57,907
I want two each inside of here.
The other 30 around here.

1884
01:41:57,995 --> 01:41:59,349
Roofs, alleys, balconies.

1885
01:41:59,435 --> 01:42:02,507
- Eyes on the horsemen at all times.
- Yes, sir.

1886
01:42:02,595 --> 01:42:06,430
Wow, 100 years ago, William Robinson
took the name Chung Ling Soo

1887
01:42:06,515 --> 01:42:10,395
and spent his entire life
never speaking English in public.

1888
01:42:12,235 --> 01:42:14,067
This other guy, Maximilian...

1889
01:42:14,275 --> 01:42:17,234
I am not interested in a history lesson
on magic at this moment.

1890
01:43:06,235 --> 01:43:07,351
I've been framed.

1891
01:43:08,675 --> 01:43:09,711
I'm sure you were.

1892
01:43:09,795 --> 01:43:11,115
Yeah, but I can prove it.

1893
01:43:11,595 --> 01:43:12,824
I always do.

1894
01:43:13,235 --> 01:43:15,192
Just like I predicted
that you'd play the fool.

1895
01:43:15,275 --> 01:43:17,744
Let's just drop the
theatricality, all right?

1896
01:43:18,035 --> 01:43:20,186
The cameras aren't rolling in here.

1897
01:43:20,395 --> 01:43:22,910
Fellas, can I have a few minutes
with my friend here alone, please.

1898
01:43:22,995 --> 01:43:24,827
Sure.

1899
01:43:29,795 --> 01:43:30,831
All right.

1900
01:43:31,875 --> 01:43:33,468
I got information to trade.

1901
01:43:33,635 --> 01:43:34,785
I believe that's how it's done. Huh?

1902
01:43:34,995 --> 01:43:36,634
If it's of some value.

1903
01:43:39,075 --> 01:43:42,227
These bars give a man time to think.

1904
01:43:43,475 --> 01:43:46,707
And I'm pretty sure I know how they did it.

1905
01:43:47,155 --> 01:43:49,306
<i>Remember the rabbit trick
in the second show?</i>

1906
01:43:50,475 --> 01:43:52,307
<i>The box was never empty.</i>

1907
01:43:54,635 --> 01:43:55,785
<i>The room wasn't either.</i>

1908
01:43:57,115 --> 01:43:59,471
<i>After gaining access to the warehouse,</i>

1909
01:43:59,795 --> 01:44:01,912
<i>the horsemen left the real safe</i>

1910
01:44:01,995 --> 01:44:04,385
<i>and transformed the whole room</i>

1911
01:44:04,475 --> 01:44:06,990
<i>into a giant rabbit box.</i>

1912
01:44:08,555 --> 01:44:10,751
<i>You go charging in there,</i>

1913
01:44:10,995 --> 01:44:13,385
<i>thinking the safe was already gone.</i>

1914
01:44:13,675 --> 01:44:14,631
Hey!

1915
01:44:14,715 --> 01:44:15,990
Hey! Stop!

1916
01:44:16,195 --> 01:44:17,629
Missing the trick. Again.

1917
01:44:17,715 --> 01:44:18,796
Which was to make you think

1918
01:44:18,995 --> 01:44:20,554
the safe had already been stolen,

1919
01:44:20,635 --> 01:44:22,831
so you'd drop your guard and leave.

1920
01:44:23,435 --> 01:44:26,394
<i>Now, while you were busy
playing with balloon animals,</i>

1921
01:44:26,595 --> 01:44:29,155
<i>someone was breaking into the warehouse.</i>

1922
01:44:47,675 --> 01:44:48,870
<i>Who?</i>

1923
01:44:50,275 --> 01:44:51,789
<i>Jack Wilder.</i>

1924
01:44:52,515 --> 01:44:53,869
Holy shit.

1925
01:44:54,075 --> 01:44:56,431
No. No way. He died
right in front of my eyes.

1926
01:44:57,235 --> 01:44:59,352
Unless, of course, he didn't.

1927
01:45:06,715 --> 01:45:07,944
It's locked.

1928
01:45:08,755 --> 01:45:09,950
Weren't you listening?

1929
01:45:10,475 --> 01:45:11,545
Nothing's ever locked.

1930
01:45:12,915 --> 01:45:15,714
Well done, Mr. Wilder! Good work.

1931
01:45:15,875 --> 01:45:17,707
You're a big boy now, Jack.

1932
01:45:17,875 --> 01:45:20,265
He escaped in a standard
FBI vehicle, right?

1933
01:45:24,075 --> 01:45:25,395
<i>Led you to the bridge.</i>

1934
01:45:25,635 --> 01:45:27,274
<i>Where the other horsemen were waiting</i>

1935
01:45:27,395 --> 01:45:29,273
<i>with an identical replacement car.</i>

1936
01:45:30,275 --> 01:45:31,394
<i>It only took a split second</i>

1937
01:45:31,395 --> 01:45:32,351
<i>for you to lose contact with it</i>

1938
01:45:32,435 --> 01:45:33,425
<i>and make the switch.</i>

1939
01:45:55,755 --> 01:45:58,748
<i>When you crawled into that burning car,</i>

1940
01:45:59,155 --> 01:46:01,147
<i>quite heroically, I might add,</i>

1941
01:46:03,035 --> 01:46:05,106
<i>you almost died trying to rescue</i>

1942
01:46:05,195 --> 01:46:08,188
<i>what I assume was
a cadaver from the morgue.</i>

1943
01:46:09,675 --> 01:46:13,351
<i>Why go through
such an elaborate and dangerous plan</i>

1944
01:46:14,115 --> 01:46:15,595
just to frame one guy?

1945
01:46:15,955 --> 01:46:16,991
I don't know.

1946
01:46:17,115 --> 01:46:18,515
They never kept any of the money they took.

1947
01:46:18,635 --> 01:46:21,114
Yeah, that's the part
I haven't been able to put together yet.

1948
01:46:21,115 --> 01:46:23,836
But I just gave you information that
is substantially more important.

1949
01:46:23,955 --> 01:46:25,674
- No. Not really.
- What?

1950
01:46:25,755 --> 01:46:30,307
I finally got a chance to
really look into Lionel shrike.

1951
01:46:30,595 --> 01:46:33,349
His comeback attempt. His accident.

1952
01:46:34,315 --> 01:46:37,786
The insurer who denied the family's claim?

1953
01:46:37,995 --> 01:46:39,224
Tressler insurance.

1954
01:46:41,155 --> 01:46:43,386
The bank that carried the note?

1955
01:46:44,475 --> 01:46:46,148
Credit republican of Paris.

1956
01:46:46,355 --> 01:46:47,994
Credit republican de Paris.

1957
01:46:49,315 --> 01:46:50,715
What do you make of that?

1958
01:46:50,835 --> 01:46:52,986
A sucker is born every minute.

1959
01:46:53,755 --> 01:46:56,315
What if all this was just leading up to

1960
01:46:56,395 --> 01:46:59,115
us getting mugged
in central park at 2:00 A.M.?

1961
01:46:59,195 --> 01:47:01,915
No, I'm telling you,
we're right where we need to be.

1962
01:47:01,995 --> 01:47:03,065
We just have to find...

1963
01:47:03,155 --> 01:47:04,271
That?

1964
01:47:06,835 --> 01:47:08,554
The Lionel shrike tree.

1965
01:47:09,515 --> 01:47:11,984
And the card encased in glass.

1966
01:47:13,355 --> 01:47:14,948
What do we do now?

1967
01:47:31,595 --> 01:47:33,075
Oh, nice!

1968
01:47:48,915 --> 01:47:50,395
<i>So, here's my new theory.</i>

1969
01:47:50,875 --> 01:47:54,312
The legend is that the "eye" is everywhere.

1970
01:47:54,955 --> 01:47:56,105
Waiting

1971
01:47:56,555 --> 01:48:00,310
for the truly great magicians
to distinguish themselves

1972
01:48:01,275 --> 01:48:03,073
from the mediocre ones.

1973
01:48:03,875 --> 01:48:05,104
Maybe that was you.

1974
01:48:05,715 --> 01:48:07,991
Deep down inside
you wanted nothing more

1975
01:48:08,075 --> 01:48:10,670
than to be part of the "eye,"
but you were never invited.

1976
01:48:10,755 --> 01:48:13,953
So you try to destroy them.
But instead what happens?

1977
01:48:14,395 --> 01:48:15,909
You pissed them off.

1978
01:48:17,595 --> 01:48:20,667
The eye isn't real.

1979
01:48:20,755 --> 01:48:23,827
Okay, then, explain then.
Who's behind all this?

1980
01:48:24,075 --> 01:48:25,395
Somebody with an obsession.

1981
01:48:25,675 --> 01:48:27,075
- Meticulous.
- Who?

1982
01:48:27,155 --> 01:48:30,512
Somebody prepared to sacrifice everything.

1983
01:48:30,595 --> 01:48:33,155
Somebody so prepared to lose

1984
01:48:33,235 --> 01:48:35,750
that they wouldn't even be a suspect
until the trick was done.

1985
01:48:35,835 --> 01:48:38,669
I don't want a profile.
I need a name. Who? Who?

1986
01:48:38,755 --> 01:48:40,428
I don't know who.

1987
01:48:40,795 --> 01:48:42,991
But they had to have
access to the warehouse

1988
01:48:43,115 --> 01:48:44,435
to plant the mirrors.

1989
01:48:45,755 --> 01:48:49,590
Always a step ahead of me. And the FBI.

1990
01:48:49,675 --> 01:48:52,952
Got past them not once,
not twice, but consistently.

1991
01:48:53,275 --> 01:48:55,915
Almost as if they were on the...

1992
01:49:08,795 --> 01:49:10,149
The inside.

1993
01:49:22,315 --> 01:49:23,351
You.

1994
01:49:27,955 --> 01:49:28,945
Why?

1995
01:49:29,795 --> 01:49:32,151
That is the question, isn't it?

1996
01:49:32,995 --> 01:49:34,509
You're right.

1997
01:49:35,155 --> 01:49:37,465
I can't tell you how long I've waited

1998
01:49:37,555 --> 01:49:39,512
to see the look on your face.

1999
01:49:41,995 --> 01:49:43,475
Who are you?

2000
01:49:44,555 --> 01:49:45,989
What do you want from me?

2001
01:49:46,835 --> 01:49:48,315
What do I want?

2002
01:49:48,755 --> 01:49:51,668
I want you to spend
the rest of your life in this cell,

2003
01:49:51,755 --> 01:49:55,749
staring at four walls
and wondering how you missed it.

2004
01:49:56,435 --> 01:49:59,507
How you let yourself
be so blinded by your ego

2005
01:50:00,075 --> 01:50:02,510
that you convinced yourself
that you were one step ahead

2006
01:50:02,595 --> 01:50:05,349
when you were always two steps behind.

2007
01:50:10,035 --> 01:50:11,230
Dylan?

2008
01:50:12,195 --> 01:50:13,185
Wait a minute.

2009
01:50:14,235 --> 01:50:16,352
Dylan! How did this happen?

2010
01:50:24,035 --> 01:50:25,708
Dylan!

2011
01:50:25,835 --> 01:50:26,825
Why?

2012
01:50:27,515 --> 01:50:28,505
Why?

2013
01:50:32,555 --> 01:50:34,706
Oh, my God.

2014
01:50:35,715 --> 01:50:37,593
I did not see that coming.

2015
01:50:37,715 --> 01:50:38,944
That's impossible!

2016
01:50:39,035 --> 01:50:40,025
No way.

2017
01:50:40,115 --> 01:50:42,550
That was actually pretty good.

2018
01:50:42,955 --> 01:50:44,025
Thank you.

2019
01:50:44,475 --> 01:50:46,671
When I said,
"always be the smartest guy in the room."

2020
01:50:46,755 --> 01:50:47,791
We were in agreement.

2021
01:50:48,035 --> 01:50:49,230
Okay. Right.

2022
01:50:49,595 --> 01:50:50,585
Henley.

2023
01:50:51,395 --> 01:50:53,227
I've never seen her speechless.

2024
01:50:53,315 --> 01:50:54,874
I take that as a huge compliment.

2025
01:50:55,595 --> 01:50:58,269
Hey, man,
I'm so sorry for kicking your ass. Really.

2026
01:50:59,075 --> 01:51:00,555
Hey, listen, for the record,

2027
01:51:00,715 --> 01:51:04,231
I have always been a 100% believer.

2028
01:51:04,395 --> 01:51:06,671
And the amount of energy
I have expended to keep

2029
01:51:06,755 --> 01:51:08,872
these infidels on point...

2030
01:51:08,955 --> 01:51:10,992
Merritt, you're in.

2031
01:51:11,835 --> 01:51:12,905
God bless.

2032
01:51:12,995 --> 01:51:14,031
Come.

2033
01:51:15,075 --> 01:51:18,227
The real magic is taking
four strong solo acts

2034
01:51:18,475 --> 01:51:20,353
and making them all work together.

2035
01:51:20,595 --> 01:51:22,871
And that's exactly what you did.

2036
01:51:23,835 --> 01:51:24,905
So welcome.

2037
01:51:28,275 --> 01:51:30,312
Welcome to the eye.

2038
01:52:37,515 --> 01:52:39,586
It was all connected.

2039
01:52:40,195 --> 01:52:43,188
Credit republican. Tressler insurance.

2040
01:52:52,595 --> 01:52:53,870
And Elkhorn?

2041
01:52:53,995 --> 01:52:55,907
What's the connection to shrike?

2042
01:52:58,435 --> 01:53:01,633
Elkhorn started as a safe manufacturer.

2043
01:53:01,995 --> 01:53:04,112
They used cheap steel.

2044
01:53:05,675 --> 01:53:06,995
They cut corners.

2045
01:53:07,075 --> 01:53:10,273
When he got to the bottom of
the river, the safe warped.

2046
01:53:10,355 --> 01:53:11,755
And he was trapped.

2047
01:53:13,275 --> 01:53:14,868
He was your father.

2048
01:53:16,755 --> 01:53:20,066
<i>The morning before the show
didn't feel like any other day.</i>

2049
01:53:21,115 --> 01:53:26,110
<i>When my father said he had to go to work, he
could see that I didn't want him to leave.</i>

2050
01:53:28,395 --> 01:53:33,515
<i>So he gave me his watch, and he told me
to count the seconds until he came back.</i>

2051
01:53:34,675 --> 01:53:37,395
<i>I have never let his watch stop since then.</i>

2052
01:53:37,475 --> 01:53:39,592
And from that moment on,

2053
01:53:39,675 --> 01:53:42,235
I created a persona.

2054
01:53:42,835 --> 01:53:44,747
I planned. I worked out every detail.

2055
01:53:44,835 --> 01:53:48,146
But the one thing
that I couldn't imagine happening

2056
01:53:48,555 --> 01:53:49,705
was you.

2057
01:53:51,395 --> 01:53:54,354
And I know that
the logical conclusion for you

2058
01:53:54,875 --> 01:53:57,629
is to take this case to it's resolution.

2059
01:53:57,715 --> 01:54:00,753
And for you to turn me in.

2060
01:54:05,875 --> 01:54:06,911
Yeah.

2061
01:54:08,875 --> 01:54:12,710
But you know how I feel
about resolution and logic.

2062
01:54:14,075 --> 01:54:15,429
And you also know

2063
01:54:16,315 --> 01:54:20,628
that I think some things
are best left unexplained.

2064
01:54:27,155 --> 01:54:28,953
One more secret to lock away.

2065
01:54:41,075 --> 01:54:42,065
Come here!

2066
01:54:43,315 --> 01:54:44,749
Get back! Get back!

2067
01:54:46,235 --> 01:54:47,555
Dylan, let's go, man!

2068
01:54:47,755 --> 01:54:48,745
Come on, you...

2069
01:54:50,235 --> 01:54:52,306
- Come on, man! Get out!
- He's gonna die in here.

2070
01:54:52,395 --> 01:54:53,749
Leave him! There's nothing you can do!

2071
01:54:53,835 --> 01:54:55,747
Let's go! Leave him!

2072
01:55:00,555 --> 01:55:01,909
- The paper!
- Dylan!

2073
01:55:02,195 --> 01:55:04,107
Let's go! Let's go! Come on!

2074
01:56:52,995 --> 01:56:54,873
Please, stop, stop, stop.

2075
01:56:55,235 --> 01:56:58,945
All right, stop the van. Stop the van.
I'm gonna jump out of the van.

2076
01:56:59,955 --> 01:57:01,435
Oh, thank God.

2077
01:57:03,395 --> 01:57:05,466
Where are we?

2078
01:57:05,555 --> 01:57:07,945
Great, another shit hole.

2079
01:57:08,075 --> 01:57:09,987
Okay, feeling it.

2080
01:57:10,075 --> 01:57:14,228
I'm exhausted, and hungry, and cranky.

2081
01:57:15,275 --> 01:57:17,153
Check out this place.

2082
01:57:17,235 --> 01:57:20,034
- Where'd you bring us?
- Was there no landfill where we were?

2083
01:57:20,115 --> 01:57:21,993
This place is awesome.

2084
01:57:23,515 --> 01:57:24,505
Is this our new gear?

2085
01:57:24,635 --> 01:57:26,149
There'd better not be, like,
matching jumpsuits in there.

2086
01:57:26,235 --> 01:57:27,271
You know I don't wear spandex.

2087
01:57:27,355 --> 01:57:29,745
- It's locked.
- Guys, the cards.

2088
01:57:29,835 --> 01:57:32,350
- What card?
- What do you mean, "what card"?

2089
01:57:36,475 --> 01:57:37,465
Okay.
