Jan-13-2010

3
00:01:32,953 --> 00:01:33,953
What's hapening?

4
00:01:35,271 --> 00:01:36,271
Why are you taking a bath?

5
00:01:37,542 --> 00:01:38,685
I'm not.

6
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:45,090
<i>...way out...</i>

7
00:01:46,107 --> 00:01:47,107
<i>...everyone...</i>

8
00:01:49,272 --> 00:01:50,272
<i>...where are you...</i>

9
00:02:40,143 --> 00:02:41,443
Papa!

10
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:51,070
It's okay.
It's just a minor earthquake.

11
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:55,312
I'm right here.

12
00:02:55,313 --> 00:02:56,313
Right here.

The Road

14
00:03:17,254 --> 00:03:19,154
The clock stopt at 1:17

15
00:03:22,072 --> 00:03:24,372
There was a long shear of bright light -

16
00:03:25,431 --> 00:03:27,831
then a series of low concussions.

17
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:38,059
I think it's October.

18
00:03:39,544 --> 00:03:40,964
But I can't be sure.

19
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:44,629
I haven't kept a calendar for years.

20
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:53,475
Each day is more gray than the one before.

21
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,641
It is cold.

22
00:03:55,742 --> 00:03:57,442
I am growing colder.

23
00:03:57,443 --> 00:03:59,143
As the world slowly dies.

24
00:04:00,478 --> 00:04:02,678
No animals have survived.

25
00:04:02,764 --> 00:04:04,564
All the crops have long gone.

26
00:04:08,437 --> 00:04:10,537
Soon all the trees in the world will fall.

27
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:23,191
The roads are peopled by refugees towing carts -

28
00:04:23,392 --> 00:04:25,192
and gangs carrying weapons -

29
00:04:27,015 --> 00:04:28,615
looking for fuel and food.

30
00:04:50,763 --> 00:04:53,563
Within a year there were fires on the ridges -

31
00:04:53,664 --> 00:04:55,664
and deranged chanting.

32
00:04:58,724 --> 00:05:02,424
"Behold the Valley of Slaughter"
- Jeremiah 19:6

33
00:05:02,925 --> 00:05:04,725
There has been cannibalism.

34
00:05:06,004 --> 00:05:07,904
Cannibalism is the great fear.

35
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:17,259
Mostly I worry about food.

36
00:05:17,489 --> 00:05:18,889
Always food.

37
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,920
Food. An the cold.
And our shoes.

38
00:05:37,611 --> 00:05:42,054
Sometimes I tell the boy old
stories of courage and justice.

39
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,600
Difficult as they are to remember.

40
00:05:46,088 --> 00:05:48,188
All I know is the child is my warrant.

41
00:05:49,726 --> 00:05:51,726
And if he is not the word of God -

42
00:05:52,376 --> 00:05:54,176
then God never spoke.

43
00:06:25,736 --> 00:06:28,184
<i>...you can land on Lady Libertys torch.</i>

44
00:06:29,469 --> 00:06:32,576
"If you flicked your tongue like a chameleon..."

45
00:06:32,968 --> 00:06:37,243
"you could whip the food off your
plate without using your hands!"

46
00:06:38,006 --> 00:06:39,006
"But what would your mother say?"

47
00:06:40,031 --> 00:06:43,048
"If you crane your neck like a crane..."

48
00:06:43,258 --> 00:06:49,033
"you have to strech your arm
way up to scratch your head."

49
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:56,085
<i>...you had eagle eyes so you
could spot a running rabbit ...</i>

50
00:08:04,138 --> 00:08:05,738
Let's take a look.

51
00:08:21,814 --> 00:08:24,763
It could be something here.
Corn or something.

52
00:08:25,366 --> 00:08:26,466
Nah.

53
00:08:28,069 --> 00:08:29,669
They run out of food.

54
00:08:38,178 --> 00:08:39,778
Maybe there's some hayseeds in the hayloft.

55
00:08:42,224 --> 00:08:43,224
I doubt it.

56
00:08:58,515 --> 00:09:00,915
It's not what you think.

57
00:09:02,096 --> 00:09:05,034
Committed suicide.
- Why?

58
00:09:06,393 --> 00:09:07,393
You know why.

59
00:09:28,062 --> 00:09:30,662
Two left. One for you, one for me.

60
00:09:45,071 --> 00:09:47,967
Put it in your mouth.
You point it up.

61
00:09:49,545 --> 00:09:50,545
Just like I show'd you.

62
00:09:51,823 --> 00:09:52,823
Okay.

63
00:09:53,124 --> 00:09:54,224
Like this.

64
00:09:57,681 --> 00:09:59,681
Then just pull the trigger.
Okay?

65
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:08,565
Is it okay?
- Okay.

66
00:10:35,356 --> 00:10:36,956
Hungry?

67
00:10:38,977 --> 00:10:42,247
Thanks. Thirsty.
- Thirsty?

68
00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:43,829
Water.

69
00:10:47,955 --> 00:10:48,955
You're pretty.

70
00:11:01,772 --> 00:11:02,772
Oh no.

71
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:23,938
We don't have to do this.
I don't want to do this.

72
00:11:23,993 --> 00:11:24,993
I think we do.

73
00:11:26,146 --> 00:11:27,646
No, I don't want to do this.

74
00:11:28,092 --> 00:11:29,792
Not into life like this.

75
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:34,741
You have to push.
Come on.

76
00:11:37,402 --> 00:11:38,402
Push.

77
00:12:25,463 --> 00:12:27,063
Quick! Get up!

78
00:12:34,637 --> 00:12:36,637
Get around.
Stay low. Go, go.

79
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:06,833
<i>Check those junks over there.</i>

80
00:13:18,917 --> 00:13:19,917
<i>...watch your head...</i>

81
00:14:04,732 --> 00:14:06,532
Don't look at them.
Look at me.

82
00:14:08,119 --> 00:14:09,919
You call out,
you're dead.

83
00:14:10,796 --> 00:14:11,796
Where are you from?

84
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:14,051
Doesn't matter.

85
00:14:15,081 --> 00:14:16,554
Where are you from?

86
00:14:17,341 --> 00:14:19,530
You got ammunition for those rifles?

87
00:14:21,365 --> 00:14:24,115
I told you not to look over there.

88
00:14:31,001 --> 00:14:32,701
Have you eaten?

89
00:14:32,802 --> 00:14:33,802
Whatever we can find.

90
00:14:34,003 --> 00:14:36,963
What you can find.
- Yeah.

91
00:14:47,342 --> 00:14:49,063
You ain't gonna shoot that thing.

92
00:14:51,205 --> 00:14:54,082
You ain't got but two shells.
Maybe one.

93
00:14:55,223 --> 00:14:58,468
They'll hear the shot.
- Maybe. But you won't.

94
00:14:59,951 --> 00:15:04,380
Because it will be thru your skull inside
your brain before you can hear it.

95
00:15:05,904 --> 00:15:09,028
To hear it you will need a frontal
lobe and things with names like -

96
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:11,055
colliculus and temporal gyrus -

97
00:15:11,056 --> 00:15:13,289
and you wont have them
anymore. They'll just be soup.

98
00:15:15,261 --> 00:15:16,661
Are you a doctor?

99
00:15:17,999 --> 00:15:19,399
I'm not anything.

100
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,868
We got a man hurt.
It'd be worth your while.

101
00:15:25,404 --> 00:15:27,552
You look at him again,
I'll shoot you in the head.

102
00:15:27,652 --> 00:15:30,367
That boy looks hungry.
Why don't ya'll come on to the truck?

103
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:32,329
Get yourself something to eat.

104
00:15:33,577 --> 00:15:35,177
Aint no need to be such a hard-ass.

105
00:15:37,574 --> 00:15:39,374
You don't have anything to eat.

106
00:15:40,846 --> 00:15:42,653
Come on. Let's go.

107
00:15:42,854 --> 00:15:44,306
I ain't going nowhere.

108
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,007
You will come or I'll kill you.

109
00:15:50,647 --> 00:15:51,775
You're wrong.

110
00:15:51,776 --> 00:15:53,897
You know what I think?

111
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,120
I think you're chickenshit.

112
00:15:56,988 --> 00:15:59,572
You never killed a man in your life.

113
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:14,656
<i>Where did it come from?</i>

114
00:16:14,757 --> 00:16:15,757
<i>Whose shoot?</i>

115
00:16:18,419 --> 00:16:19,419
<i>...he's gone...</i>

116
00:16:29,658 --> 00:16:31,458
Let's go. Come on.

117
00:16:32,465 --> 00:16:34,700
<i>Treeline. Come on.</i>

118
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,900
<i>...over there...</i>

119
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,258
You're okay?
I'm right here.

120
00:17:24,613 --> 00:17:26,113
Let's go.

121
00:17:53,075 --> 00:17:55,960
I try to look like any common traveling killer -

122
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,844
but my heart is hammering.

123
00:18:02,531 --> 00:18:04,131
When it comes to the boy -

124
00:18:06,235 --> 00:18:07,835
I have only one question:

125
00:18:10,887 --> 00:18:12,787
Can you do it -

126
00:18:13,853 --> 00:18:15,553
when the time comes?

127
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:27,938
I will not let anything hapen to you.
I'll take care of you.

128
00:18:36,176 --> 00:18:38,476
I will kill anyone who touches you.

129
00:18:42,006 --> 00:18:44,110
Because that's my job.

130
00:19:16,277 --> 00:19:21,146
Please stop crying.
We gotta go now.

131
00:19:21,147 --> 00:19:22,847
We're gonna find the cart.

132
00:19:30,221 --> 00:19:31,221
Come on.

133
00:19:33,349 --> 00:19:34,793
Take the gun.

134
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:31,100
That's all we have left.

135
00:20:33,683 --> 00:20:35,490
I should have done it a long time ago.

136
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:38,031
I should have done it when we had
more bullets. But I listen to you.

137
00:20:41,372 --> 00:20:44,725
They're gonna catch up with us
and they are going to kill us.

138
00:20:46,889 --> 00:20:50,824
They are going to rape me and
then they'll gonna rape your son -

139
00:20:50,925 --> 00:20:51,825
and then they'll gonna kill us.

140
00:20:51,826 --> 00:20:52,826
And eat us.

141
00:20:53,767 --> 00:20:55,416
Whatever it takes...
- Stop it!

142
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:56,830
I told you...
Stop it!

143
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,772
I'll do anything.
Anything...

144
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,599
Like what?

145
00:21:13,456 --> 00:21:14,956
I don't even know why even ask you.

146
00:21:15,534 --> 00:21:19,232
I should just go ahead and empty
every goddamn bullet into my brain -

147
00:21:19,233 --> 00:21:20,633
and leave you with nothing!
That's what I should do.

148
00:21:20,634 --> 00:21:24,378
Shh. Please don't talk like that.

149
00:21:28,076 --> 00:21:31,540
You're right. There's 
nothing left to talk about.

150
00:21:35,506 --> 00:21:37,998
My heart was ripped out of
me the night he was born.

151
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:45,996
We have to...
We will survive this.

152
00:21:45,997 --> 00:21:50,960
We are... not going to quit.
Not going to quit.

153
00:21:54,361 --> 00:21:59,391
You want us to survive?
Don't you get it?

154
00:22:00,543 --> 00:22:02,443
I don't wanna.

155
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:09,358
I want you let me take him with me.

156
00:22:11,686 --> 00:22:12,903
Don't touch it.

157
00:22:15,404 --> 00:22:20,620
I would take him with me if it
weren't for you. You know that.

158
00:22:20,621 --> 00:22:21,621
Listen to yourself.

159
00:22:24,565 --> 00:22:26,065
You sound -

160
00:22:28,809 --> 00:22:30,296
crazy.

161
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,240
Other families are doing it.

162
00:23:26,389 --> 00:23:27,989
Let's take a bath.

163
00:24:05,931 --> 00:24:08,827
Listen...
We have to talk.

164
00:24:12,482 --> 00:24:13,482
That man back there -

165
00:24:17,742 --> 00:24:21,160
there are not many good guys left.
That's all.

166
00:24:22,736 --> 00:24:23,936
Gotta watch out for the bad guys.

167
00:24:24,137 --> 00:24:28,897
We have to just...
keep carrying the fire.

168
00:24:34,762 --> 00:24:36,462
What fire?

169
00:24:37,756 --> 00:24:39,256
Fire inside you.

170
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:51,304
Are we still the good guys?

171
00:24:51,405 --> 00:24:55,233
Yes, we're still the good guys.
Of course we are.

172
00:24:57,688 --> 00:25:01,185
We always will be,
no matter what happends?

173
00:25:03,273 --> 00:25:06,260
Always will be.

174
00:25:30,689 --> 00:25:32,089
What is it?

175
00:25:34,326 --> 00:25:36,126
It's a treat for you.

176
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:50,867
Go ahead.

177
00:26:12,349 --> 00:26:13,349
Really good.

178
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:18,223
You should have some.
- No, you drink it.

179
00:26:19,614 --> 00:26:20,614
I want you to have some.

180
00:26:24,528 --> 00:26:25,928
It's bubbly.

181
00:26:40,164 --> 00:26:41,664
It's for you.

182
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:53,468
Come on.

183
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:58,170
I'm coming.

184
00:27:35,221 --> 00:27:38,393
I'm hungry.
- I know.

185
00:27:38,594 --> 00:27:39,894
So am I.

186
00:27:44,188 --> 00:27:48,536
And we are still heading south?
- Of course.

187
00:27:50,986 --> 00:27:52,445
There might be food there.

188
00:27:52,446 --> 00:27:55,890
Everything depends on
reaching the coast. Okay?

189
00:27:57,899 --> 00:27:59,199
Okay.

190
00:28:07,753 --> 00:28:09,553
I wish I was with my mom.

191
00:28:16,941 --> 00:28:18,541
Meaning you wish you were dead.

192
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,028
Yeah.

193
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:30,670
You mustn't say that.
It's a bad thing to say.

194
00:28:33,998 --> 00:28:34,763
I can't help it.

195
00:28:35,892 --> 00:28:37,692
Just stop thinking about her.

196
00:30:40,215 --> 00:30:42,015
Would you at least say goodbye to him.

197
00:30:43,416 --> 00:30:44,916
No.
- No?

198
00:30:45,133 --> 00:30:46,933
No. Noo.

199
00:30:49,265 --> 00:30:51,965
Why not?
- I can't.

200
00:30:52,432 --> 00:30:55,702
Why can't...
why can't you stay until morning?

201
00:30:58,894 --> 00:31:00,794
Because I can't.

202
00:31:00,895 --> 00:31:03,351
Can you spend one more night with me.
- I have to go.

203
00:31:03,641 --> 00:31:05,289
Why?

204
00:31:06,806 --> 00:31:09,833
Why you have to go?
Why...!?

205
00:31:20,706 --> 00:31:22,706
What am I to tell him?

206
00:31:28,304 --> 00:31:29,704
What am I to tell him?

207
00:31:39,594 --> 00:31:41,647
You go south.

208
00:31:43,047 --> 00:31:44,747
Keep him warm,
and you go south.

209
00:31:48,052 --> 00:31:50,152
No one will survive another winter here.

210
00:31:59,526 --> 00:32:01,126
Why won't you help me?

211
00:32:03,127 --> 00:32:05,966
Where are you going?
You can't even see out there.

212
00:32:06,067 --> 00:32:07,667
I don't need to.
I don't need to see.

213
00:32:12,186 --> 00:32:13,486
I beg you.
- Don't.

214
00:32:14,934 --> 00:32:15,934
Please.
- No.

215
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:18,966
Don't.

216
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:28,411
She was gone.

217
00:32:29,568 --> 00:32:32,038
And the coldness of it was her final gift.

218
00:32:35,136 --> 00:32:37,136
But she died somewhere in the dark.

219
00:32:40,652 --> 00:32:42,552
There are no other tales to tell.

220
00:33:01,904 --> 00:33:04,549
Look! Those colours.

221
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:12,370
Want to go in?

222
00:33:53,674 --> 00:33:54,974
Come on.

223
00:34:24,011 --> 00:34:25,511
Papa!

224
00:34:52,094 --> 00:34:54,394
There's a reason this is locked.

225
00:35:43,043 --> 00:35:45,045
Nothing's gonna happen.

226
00:36:00,994 --> 00:36:03,030
It's okay.

227
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,815
What's that?

228
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:31,158
My God.

229
00:36:31,859 --> 00:36:32,859
<i>Help us, please.</i>

230
00:36:38,632 --> 00:36:42,202
Help us.
- Let's go.

231
00:36:43,003 --> 00:36:46,473
Away from me!
- Wait, wait!

232
00:36:46,974 --> 00:36:49,309
I can't get us thru here!

233
00:36:51,445 --> 00:36:53,447
Go, go, go!

234
00:36:55,616 --> 00:36:57,618
Wait!

235
00:37:01,789 --> 00:37:04,358
No!

236
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:07,361
Look!

237
00:37:22,609 --> 00:37:24,645
Tule.

238
00:37:44,932 --> 00:37:48,268
Bad guys. Bad men.

239
00:37:49,903 --> 00:37:52,306
Bad men.

240
00:37:55,342 --> 00:37:58,979
<i>Who left this window open?
- I leave it open because of the smell.</i>

241
00:37:59,146 --> 00:38:01,415
What small?
- You don't smell it anymore?

242
00:38:01,582 --> 00:38:03,584
Who want's to drink?

243
00:38:13,393 --> 00:38:16,730
<i>It's rained all day.
- I going up to change.</i>

244
00:38:17,631 --> 00:38:20,300
They are bad men.

245
00:38:22,302 --> 00:38:25,139
No, no...
- Take it!

246
00:38:25,539 --> 00:38:28,442
Don't be afraid.

247
00:38:30,611 --> 00:38:34,715
When they get hold to you,
you have to do it as anybody else.

248
00:38:37,151 --> 00:38:39,453
You have to brave.
You have to!

249
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:42,623
Have to.
You know how.

250
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:45,292
I quess.

251
00:38:50,464 --> 00:38:52,466
What are you doing?

252
00:38:54,101 --> 00:38:56,170
I'm so sorry.

253
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:01,575
Will I see you again?

254
00:39:02,242 --> 00:39:04,444
When would I see you?

255
00:39:04,945 --> 00:39:08,382
<i>What's going on?
- What the hell was that?</i>

256
00:39:09,416 --> 00:39:11,585
<i>What's hapening over there?</i>

257
00:39:17,825 --> 00:39:20,127
<i>The cellar hatch is open.</i>

258
00:39:21,195 --> 00:39:23,197
<i>Goddamn it.</i>

259
00:39:25,466 --> 00:39:27,534
Gome on!

260
00:40:29,763 --> 00:40:31,932
<i>Keep hold on him.
- Got it.</i>

261
00:40:34,401 --> 00:40:36,537
<i>Son of a bitch.</i>

262
00:40:55,022 --> 00:40:57,858
Wake up.

263
00:40:58,926 --> 00:41:02,596
We have to get out of here.
We gotta go now.

264
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:05,632
Come on.

265
00:41:16,143 --> 00:41:18,312
Last one.

266
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:36,296
We would never eat anybody, would we?

267
00:41:38,365 --> 00:41:41,034
No, of course not.

268
00:41:44,004 --> 00:41:47,007
No matter how hungry we were?

269
00:41:48,775 --> 00:41:51,178
Even if we were starving?

270
00:41:51,345 --> 00:41:53,747
We're starving now.

271
00:41:55,082 --> 00:41:57,417
Because we're the good guys.

272
00:41:58,852 --> 00:42:02,956
Yes.
- And we're carrying the fire.

273
00:42:08,362 --> 00:42:10,364
Yes.

274
00:42:26,914 --> 00:42:28,916
This way.

275
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,856
What is this place, Papa?

276
00:42:37,691 --> 00:42:40,027
The house where I grow up.

277
00:42:55,509 --> 00:42:57,711
That's me.

278
00:43:04,751 --> 00:43:08,388
This is where we used to have
our Xmas tree, when I was a boy.

279
00:43:18,098 --> 00:43:20,767
Here is where we hung our stockings.

280
00:43:37,284 --> 00:43:39,953
I don't think we 
should be doing this.

281
00:43:52,132 --> 00:43:54,468
You want to wait outside?

282
00:45:34,368 --> 00:45:35,433
No, wait!

283
00:45:35,934 --> 00:45:36,734
<i>Hey!</i>

284
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:38,039
Wait!

285
00:45:40,169 --> 00:45:43,484
Wait. Come on.
I'm not going to hurt you.

286
00:45:46,947 --> 00:45:49,249
What are you doing?

287
00:45:50,083 --> 00:45:52,085
What are you doing?
- What?

288
00:45:52,152 --> 00:45:54,621
There's a little boy, Papa!
- What little boy?

289
00:45:54,788 --> 00:45:56,876
I saw a little boy!
- What the hell are you doing?

290
00:45:57,077 --> 00:45:58,077
I saw a little boy!

291
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:02,429
There's no boy.
- Let off! There is. Just like me.

292
00:46:02,563 --> 00:46:04,898
Come on.
- No!

293
00:46:06,099 --> 00:46:10,037
Stop it! You scared the hell
out of me. - No!

294
00:46:10,537 --> 00:46:13,140
I need to see him!
- Stop it.

295
00:46:13,574 --> 00:46:15,676
What the hell happend?

296
00:46:15,876 --> 00:46:18,278
What the hell are you doing?

297
00:46:19,513 --> 00:46:22,749
I need to. - Why?
- I just do.

298
00:46:25,185 --> 00:46:28,589
He's right there.
- I understand.

299
00:46:28,889 --> 00:46:32,025
I understand. It's okay.

300
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:38,599
It's going to be all right.

301
00:46:51,411 --> 00:46:53,781
He imagines how's things
will be at the coast.

302
00:46:55,883 --> 00:46:58,252
And that there will be
other children there.

303
00:46:59,186 --> 00:47:01,355
He asked what happend to my friends -

304
00:47:01,822 --> 00:47:04,424
when I tell him they died -

305
00:47:04,792 --> 00:47:06,794
and I miss them.

306
00:47:12,099 --> 00:47:17,838
When I have nothing else, I try to dream
the dreams of a child's imaginings.

307
00:47:38,592 --> 00:47:40,594
Are we going to die now?

308
00:47:46,834 --> 00:47:48,836
What do you think is going to happen?

309
00:47:50,904 --> 00:47:53,907
That you're just going to
suddently keel over and die?

310
00:47:54,875 --> 00:47:58,579
Takes long time to die in starvation.

311
00:48:30,944 --> 00:48:33,547
Every day is a lie.

312
00:48:33,914 --> 00:48:36,116
But I'm slowly dying.

313
00:48:36,517 --> 00:48:38,519
That is not a lie.

314
00:48:41,355 --> 00:48:44,224
I'm trying to prepare him
for the day when I'm gone.

315
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:02,042
Nothing we haven't seen before.

316
00:50:13,474 --> 00:50:14,686
Papa!

317
00:50:17,498 --> 00:50:18,710
Papa!

318
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:25,592
What? What's wrong?

319
00:50:27,394 --> 00:50:29,396
Look.

320
00:50:30,931 --> 00:50:32,933
We look skinny.

321
00:50:34,234 --> 00:50:36,236
You are skinny.

322
00:50:38,605 --> 00:50:40,607
Come on, let's get out of here.

323
00:51:10,304 --> 00:51:12,306
Your mother played really well.

324
00:51:13,807 --> 00:51:15,809
I don't remember.

325
00:51:17,845 --> 00:51:20,848
In our house...before.

326
00:52:05,526 --> 00:52:08,662
It's okay.
- Please Papa.

327
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:11,632
Please.

328
00:52:13,033 --> 00:52:15,035
It's okay.

329
00:52:24,611 --> 00:52:26,613
My God.

330
00:52:28,148 --> 00:52:30,150
Come down here.

331
00:52:32,786 --> 00:52:35,456
Come down.
- What did you find?

332
00:52:36,492 --> 00:52:41,406
Everything.
I found everything.

333
00:52:53,907 --> 00:52:56,910
What is all this stuff?
- Food.

334
00:52:58,946 --> 00:53:00,948
It's food.

335
00:53:01,582 --> 00:53:04,451
Here. Read the label.

336
00:53:05,419 --> 00:53:07,421
Pea...

337
00:53:07,921 --> 00:53:10,390
Pears.
- Yes.

338
00:53:10,691 --> 00:53:12,693
Pears.

339
00:53:20,067 --> 00:53:22,069
What do you want for breakfast?

340
00:53:41,755 --> 00:53:43,757
What?
- Nothing.

341
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:48,729
Is it okay for us to take all this?

342
00:53:50,898 --> 00:53:53,400
Yeah. They want us to.

343
00:53:58,439 --> 00:54:02,075
Souldn't we thank them?
- Yeah. Go ahead.

344
00:54:09,583 --> 00:54:11,585
Like this?

345
00:54:14,755 --> 00:54:16,790
Thank you for...

346
00:54:17,925 --> 00:54:20,561
soup and...

347
00:54:21,195 --> 00:54:23,197
cheese puffs.

348
00:54:23,831 --> 00:54:25,899
Cheese puffs
- And...

349
00:54:25,999 --> 00:54:28,502
All the stuff, people.

350
00:54:33,006 --> 00:54:35,008
That's good.

351
00:54:35,275 --> 00:54:37,277
Your turn.

352
00:54:42,516 --> 00:54:45,052
Thank you, people.

353
00:55:27,494 --> 00:55:29,496
You like that?

354
00:55:36,069 --> 00:55:38,205
We did it good, didn't we Papa?

355
00:55:40,641 --> 00:55:42,643
Yeah.

356
00:55:52,419 --> 00:55:54,555
Sleep now.

357
00:58:42,005 --> 00:58:43,905
Now I give you treatment.
- What?

358
00:58:44,006 --> 00:58:46,964
Keep your eyes closed.
How's that feel?

359
00:58:47,606 --> 00:58:49,906
Shampoo.
- Shampoo.

360
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:27,020
How do I look?

361
00:59:32,188 --> 00:59:33,688
What do you think?

362
00:59:56,195 --> 00:59:57,695
Can I taste some?

363
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:00,720
Why?
- You don't like it.

364
01:00:05,237 --> 01:00:07,237
Makes you feel funny.

365
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:17,740
Okay?

366
01:00:26,651 --> 01:00:28,456
You think I come from another world, don't you?

367
01:00:34,681 --> 01:00:36,181
Sort of.

368
01:00:46,921 --> 01:00:48,621
What was that?

369
01:00:54,659 --> 01:00:56,459
Sounded like a dog.

370
01:01:07,685 --> 01:01:09,285
It's not a dog.

371
01:01:11,638 --> 01:01:12,638
It is.

372
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:15,512
It is a dog.

373
01:01:17,466 --> 01:01:21,402
If it's a dog, he'll be with someone.

374
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:26,713
Who?
- I don't know.

375
01:01:28,371 --> 01:01:30,162
I'm not waiting us to find out.

376
01:01:30,874 --> 01:01:34,623
No, I don't wanna go.
- It's not safe here anymore.

377
01:01:34,724 --> 01:01:36,424
But...
- We're going.

378
01:01:38,911 --> 01:01:40,968
What are we going to do with all the stuff?

379
01:01:41,869 --> 01:01:43,469
We just have to take what we can.

380
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:47,545
You always wait bad things
 are going to happen.

381
01:01:48,045 --> 01:01:49,545
But we found this place.

382
01:02:37,274 --> 01:02:39,074
I don't have anything for you.

383
01:02:39,475 --> 01:02:43,295
You can look if you want.
I've got nothing.

384
01:02:44,385 --> 01:02:46,085
We are no robbers.

385
01:02:51,623 --> 01:02:53,623
I said, we are no robbers.

386
01:02:53,649 --> 01:02:55,152
What are you?

387
01:02:55,353 --> 01:02:56,853
Just like you.

388
01:02:57,712 --> 01:02:59,512
What are you following me?
- We are not following you.

389
01:03:01,354 --> 01:03:03,554
We've got food we can give...
- He's not getting anything.

390
01:03:06,204 --> 01:03:08,666
He's scared.
- Everybody is scared.

391
01:03:10,619 --> 01:03:12,119
Please, Papa.

392
01:03:14,589 --> 01:03:17,534
Alright. Just one.

393
01:03:29,762 --> 01:03:31,743
Here. Take it.

394
01:03:40,838 --> 01:03:43,305
Spare a spoon?
- He's not getting a spoon.

395
01:03:51,533 --> 01:03:52,889
Pull it.

396
01:03:54,397 --> 01:03:58,477
You got it.
Eat it. It's good.

397
01:04:16,166 --> 01:04:17,521
He's hungry.

398
01:04:18,422 --> 01:04:19,786
I see him.

399
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:24,172
I know what you gonna
ask me. The answer is "No".

400
01:04:26,209 --> 01:04:27,909
What's the question?

401
01:04:29,598 --> 01:04:31,098
We can't keep him.

402
01:04:47,106 --> 01:04:49,006
You'd have dinner with us?

403
01:04:51,848 --> 01:04:54,758
I don't know.
What do I have to do?

404
01:04:55,059 --> 01:04:59,012
You'd have to do anything.
You walk okay?

405
01:05:01,546 --> 01:05:03,759
Help him.
- You help him.

406
01:05:04,457 --> 01:05:07,357
I can't.
- I can walk.

407
01:05:22,653 --> 01:05:24,053
How old are you?

408
01:05:25,196 --> 01:05:28,770
Ninety.
- Ninety my ass.

409
01:05:29,744 --> 01:05:32,270
Is that what you tell people,
so they wont hurt you? - Aha.

410
01:05:34,267 --> 01:05:36,467
It'll work?
- Nope.

411
01:05:41,385 --> 01:05:44,617
What's your name?
- Ely.

412
01:05:45,181 --> 01:05:47,890
Ely? 
- What's wrong with Ely?

413
01:05:48,290 --> 01:05:49,790
Don't hold his hand.

414
01:06:17,032 --> 01:06:20,413
That little boy.
Is he your little boy?

415
01:06:22,329 --> 01:06:24,129
Your son?

416
01:06:25,351 --> 01:06:27,151
What's it look like?

417
01:06:27,352 --> 01:06:28,852
I don't know. I can't see really good.

418
01:06:32,769 --> 01:06:34,669
Is that right?
- Yeah.

419
01:06:37,093 --> 01:06:38,593
Can you see me?

420
01:06:38,794 --> 01:06:41,564
No, I can tell somebody's there.

421
01:06:46,534 --> 01:06:48,334
You have a good little boy.

422
01:06:49,235 --> 01:06:52,346
Time for you to go to sleep.
- No. - Yes

423
01:06:53,656 --> 01:06:55,497
Good night.
- G'night.

424
01:06:56,564 --> 01:06:59,357
Good night. - Goto sleep.
- G'night son.

425
01:07:09,277 --> 01:07:13,129
You see that or can't you?
There.

426
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:23,460
When I saw that boy - 

427
01:07:26,930 --> 01:07:28,730
I thought I've died and he - 

428
01:07:30,104 --> 01:07:31,804
was an angel.

429
01:07:33,150 --> 01:07:37,144
I had a boy one time.
Of my own.

430
01:07:45,531 --> 01:07:47,431
I never thought I'd see a child again.

431
01:07:48,132 --> 01:07:51,465
Never thought that would...
happen to me.

432
01:07:52,508 --> 01:07:57,023
He's an angel.
To me he is a god.

433
01:08:00,496 --> 01:08:01,496
I hope that's not true.

434
01:08:03,681 --> 01:08:06,969
To be on the road with
the last god like that - 

435
01:08:08,608 --> 01:08:15,709
Would be nothing but a...
dangerous situation.

436
01:08:19,507 --> 01:08:21,576
What happend to your son?

437
01:08:28,271 --> 01:08:29,771
I can't talk about that.

438
01:08:33,893 --> 01:08:36,364
Not with you... anyway.

439
01:08:48,863 --> 01:08:51,952
I knew this was coming.
This or something like it.

440
01:08:52,622 --> 01:08:54,232
There were warnings.

441
01:08:57,430 --> 01:09:01,190
Some people thought it was a con.
I always believed in it.

442
01:09:02,317 --> 01:09:04,017
Did you try to get ready for it?

443
01:09:04,318 --> 01:09:05,618
What would you do?

444
01:09:06,119 --> 01:09:09,108
Even if you knew what to do
you wouldn't know what to do.

445
01:09:10,309 --> 01:09:12,312
Supposing - 

446
01:09:16,105 --> 01:09:18,014
you were the last man left alive?

447
01:09:21,890 --> 01:09:25,175
How would you know that?
That you're the last man alive?

448
01:09:25,297 --> 01:09:28,546
I guess you'll know it.
You just be it.

449
01:09:35,784 --> 01:09:39,525
Maybe God would know.
- God would know what?

450
01:09:40,761 --> 01:09:43,708
God would know what?
What he knows?

451
01:09:43,709 --> 01:09:48,216
If there's a god up there, he would
have turned his back on us by now.

452
01:09:49,011 --> 01:09:54,299
Whoever made humanity,
will find no humanity here, no sir.

453
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:59,442
No sir. So beware. Beware.

454
01:10:01,524 --> 01:10:03,639
Do you wish you would die?

455
01:10:05,095 --> 01:10:09,852
No. It's foolish to ask for
luxuries in times like these.

456
01:10:17,841 --> 01:10:21,167
He's going to die and you don't care.
- I care enough.

457
01:10:22,828 --> 01:10:26,020
When we're out of food you'll
have more time to think about it.

458
01:10:27,814 --> 01:10:30,830
Yeah, but... you always say 
watch out for bad guys.

459
01:10:31,304 --> 01:10:35,449
That old man wasn't a bad guy.
We can't even tell him.

460
01:10:49,239 --> 01:10:50,739
That'll keep it safe.

461
01:10:52,305 --> 01:10:54,822
Do you know where we are?
- About a hundred miles from the coast.

462
01:10:55,409 --> 01:10:56,623
As the crow flies.

463
01:10:57,733 --> 01:10:59,415
As the crow flies?

464
01:11:01,311 --> 01:11:05,086
It means going in a
straight line. Which we can't.

465
01:11:06,149 --> 01:11:09,505
There's not any crows. Are there?
Just in books.

466
01:11:09,506 --> 01:11:11,006
Yes. Just in books.

467
01:11:12,408 --> 01:11:14,235
Do you think there could
be crows somewhere?

468
01:11:15,686 --> 01:11:17,219
It's unlikely.

469
01:11:18,304 --> 01:11:19,932
They fly to Mars or someplace?

470
01:11:23,225 --> 01:11:25,081
You know what:
Let's go back.

471
01:11:38,881 --> 01:11:40,552
What is it?

472
01:11:44,933 --> 01:11:46,637
Let's go. Come on.

473
01:11:58,342 --> 01:11:59,570
<i>...no, no...</i>

474
01:12:01,322 --> 01:12:02,622
<i>...nooo...</i>

475
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:40,160
Hey, hey, move on. Stop!

476
01:13:07,489 --> 01:13:08,489
It's okay, its okay.

477
01:13:12,515 --> 01:13:13,715
It's okay, its okay.

478
01:13:24,463 --> 01:13:25,963
It's gone now.

479
01:14:58,223 --> 01:14:59,723
I had a bad dream.

480
01:15:10,398 --> 01:15:11,598
Stop.

481
01:15:14,298 --> 01:15:15,491
Stop.

482
01:15:21,030 --> 01:15:24,077
I tell him, he've dream about
bad things hapening - 

483
01:15:24,178 --> 01:15:27,843
shows him still fighting, you're still alive.

484
01:15:29,696 --> 01:15:32,181
When you start a dream
about good things- 

485
01:15:32,254 --> 01:15:34,137
you should start to worry.

486
01:15:40,576 --> 01:15:41,676
Here?

487
01:15:41,877 --> 01:15:42,877
No.

488
01:15:43,726 --> 01:15:45,226
Closer than we think.

489
01:15:48,079 --> 01:15:52,453
That's us.
And this is all sea.

490
01:15:57,287 --> 01:15:58,287
This...

491
01:16:00,996 --> 01:16:01,996
Is it blue?

492
01:16:03,784 --> 01:16:06,799
The sea?
I don't know.

493
01:16:08,061 --> 01:16:09,561
Used to be.

494
01:16:56,678 --> 01:16:58,219
I'm sorry, it's not blue.

495
01:17:06,890 --> 01:17:10,368
We'll be all right.
Just keep heading south.

496
01:17:14,491 --> 01:17:15,991
What's on the other side?

497
01:17:20,315 --> 01:17:21,715
Nothing.

498
01:17:23,642 --> 01:17:25,142
There has to be something.

499
01:17:26,968 --> 01:17:31,605
Maybe there's a father and his little boy - 

500
01:17:31,706 --> 01:17:33,206
and they're sitting on the beach too.

501
01:17:46,770 --> 01:17:48,745
You allright? What is it?

502
01:17:48,746 --> 01:17:49,746
Feels...

503
01:17:51,951 --> 01:17:53,329
Jesus.

504
01:17:55,822 --> 01:17:57,701
You're burning up.

505
01:18:01,227 --> 01:18:04,946
Sorry. - It's okay. You
didn't do anything wrong.

506
01:18:25,845 --> 01:18:27,817
Can I ask you a question?

507
01:18:29,213 --> 01:18:30,613
Of course.

508
01:18:35,913 --> 01:18:37,513
What would you do if I died?

509
01:18:44,042 --> 01:18:49,753
You died?
I wanna die too.

510
01:18:53,019 --> 01:18:54,436
So you could be with me?

511
01:18:57,347 --> 01:18:58,947
So I could be with you.

512
01:19:21,535 --> 01:19:22,980
What are you doing?

513
01:19:24,732 --> 01:19:26,232
Going out to that boat.

514
01:19:26,361 --> 01:19:29,512
What are you gonna do?
- See what can I find for us.

515
01:19:33,003 --> 01:19:38,033
Here. And keep a good lookout, okay?

516
01:19:39,415 --> 01:19:42,489
Okay.
- Be warm.

517
01:21:00,912 --> 01:21:02,412
Hey! What the hell happend?

518
01:21:04,113 --> 01:21:06,174
I'm sorry.
- They took everything.

519
01:21:07,377 --> 01:21:11,464
Our food. My shoes.

520
01:21:14,199 --> 01:21:15,808
Son of a bitch!

521
01:21:18,143 --> 01:21:21,328
Okay...listen.
- I'm sorry. Didn't mean to.

522
01:21:21,329 --> 01:21:22,629
It's okay.
- I fell asleep.

523
01:21:22,730 --> 01:21:24,956
Don't feel sorry.
We'll gonna get them back.

524
01:22:04,626 --> 01:22:08,333
Get away from the cart.
Put the knife down.

525
01:22:08,434 --> 01:22:10,292
Fuck you I put down a shit.

526
01:22:14,165 --> 01:22:17,209
Goddamn you.
- Papa, please don't kill the man.

527
01:22:17,910 --> 01:22:19,157
Please.

528
01:22:27,191 --> 01:22:28,691
Allright.

529
01:22:32,006 --> 01:22:35,827
Allright, I done what you said.
- Please, Papa.

530
01:22:35,928 --> 01:22:36,928
Listen to the boy.

531
01:22:37,029 --> 01:22:38,129
How long have you following us?
- Following?

532
01:22:38,330 --> 01:22:39,630
HOW LONG?

533
01:22:39,731 --> 01:22:40,931
I'm not fucking following you.

534
01:22:41,032 --> 01:22:44,009
I saw the cart in the sand
and took it, that's all.

535
01:22:44,044 --> 01:22:47,056
 I ain't touched the boy.
- Take your clothes off.

536
01:22:47,118 --> 01:22:49,854
No! - Take them off!
Every goddamned stitch.

537
01:22:49,855 --> 01:22:51,739
No. Don't do this.
- Do it!

538
01:22:51,740 --> 01:22:55,941
All right. Just take it easy.
- I'll kill you!

539
01:22:56,542 --> 01:22:57,842
Right where you stand.

540
01:22:59,607 --> 01:23:01,007
Watch up.

541
01:23:10,545 --> 01:23:11,845
Please mister.

542
01:23:14,732 --> 01:23:16,265
You ain't gotta do this.

543
01:23:23,608 --> 01:23:26,615
And the shoes.
Throw them into cartwheel.

544
01:23:28,494 --> 01:23:29,794
Throw them in the cart!

545
01:23:35,416 --> 01:23:36,620
Do it!

546
01:23:43,706 --> 01:23:46,652
You don't gotta do this to
me, man. You ain't gotta...

547
01:23:47,253 --> 01:23:48,253
I don't wanna learn.

548
01:23:48,254 --> 01:23:50,167
I'm not going to be around forever!

549
01:23:51,270 --> 01:23:52,870
Sooner or later you've to look after yourself.

550
01:23:55,322 --> 01:23:57,053
Help me with the goddamn cart!

551
01:24:14,574 --> 01:24:18,673
Would you stop sulking.
He's gone.

552
01:24:20,682 --> 01:24:22,482
He is not gone.
- What do you want me to do?

553
01:24:22,583 --> 01:24:24,083
Just help him, Papa.

554
01:24:26,084 --> 01:24:29,770
Just help him.
He's hungry.

555
01:24:31,971 --> 01:24:35,116
He's going to die.
- He's going to die anyway.

556
01:24:36,629 --> 01:24:39,623
He's so scared.
- I'm scared.

557
01:24:40,156 --> 01:24:43,501
Do you understand?
I'm scared.

558
01:24:46,622 --> 01:24:48,837
You're not the one who has
to worry about everything.

559
01:24:50,079 --> 01:24:53,897
"... ... ..."
- What? What you saying?

560
01:24:55,554 --> 01:24:56,654
YES I AM!

561
01:25:00,242 --> 01:25:01,740
I am the one.

562
01:25:04,410 --> 01:25:05,597
Okay?

563
01:25:19,439 --> 01:25:21,830
Okay. Help me to push.

564
01:25:25,831 --> 01:25:27,347
Hello!

565
01:25:30,348 --> 01:25:31,828
Hello!

566
01:26:41,009 --> 01:26:42,209
Papa.

567
01:26:44,288 --> 01:26:45,662
What? What have you got?

568
01:26:48,159 --> 01:26:49,657
What is it?
- It's a beetle.

569
01:27:00,136 --> 01:27:01,636
Get down!

570
01:27:06,708 --> 01:27:09,142
Papa!
- Son of a bitch!

571
01:27:20,244 --> 01:27:23,379
No, no! Papa!

572
01:27:30,876 --> 01:27:33,376
<i>...no, no, noo...</i>

573
01:27:47,838 --> 01:27:49,635
Cock sucking motherfucker!

574
01:27:51,336 --> 01:27:54,483
Who else is here?
- You piece of shit!

575
01:27:54,584 --> 01:27:55,984
Why are you following us?

576
01:27:56,385 --> 01:27:58,730
We're not following anybody.

577
01:27:59,774 --> 01:28:01,474
You were following us.

578
01:28:54,599 --> 01:28:55,599
Right there.

579
01:29:00,209 --> 01:29:01,012
Fuck.

580
01:29:55,103 --> 01:29:56,183
No.

581
01:30:04,742 --> 01:30:06,442
We have to leave it.

582
01:30:09,103 --> 01:30:10,903
I can't do it anymore.

583
01:30:42,904 --> 01:30:52,142
If I were God, I would have made
the world just so and no different.

584
01:30:57,137 --> 01:30:59,237
And so I have you...

585
01:31:05,192 --> 01:31:06,492
I have you.

586
01:32:10,790 --> 01:32:11,990
Okay.

587
01:32:23,453 --> 01:32:27,312
You're okay?
- Don't get too comfortable here.

588
01:32:28,666 --> 01:32:30,121
You need to keep going.

589
01:32:34,259 --> 01:32:37,304
You don't know, what
might be down the road.

590
01:32:37,414 --> 01:32:41,081
No. You're going to be okay, Papa.

591
01:32:41,182 --> 01:32:43,698
You have to.
- This has been a long time coming.

592
01:32:49,399 --> 01:32:52,313
Just keep...
just keep going south.

593
01:32:54,830 --> 01:32:56,530
Do everything the way we did it.

594
01:32:58,019 --> 01:33:01,655
Keep the gun with you allways.

595
01:33:03,458 --> 01:33:05,447
Don't let anyone take it from you.

596
01:33:09,768 --> 01:33:14,217
You need to find the good guys
but you can't take any chances.

597
01:33:15,118 --> 01:33:16,484
You hear me?

598
01:33:18,965 --> 01:33:20,685
But I want to be with you.

599
01:33:23,448 --> 01:33:24,943
I want to be with you, too.

600
01:33:26,336 --> 01:33:27,405
But I can't.

601
01:33:28,153 --> 01:33:30,319
You have to...
have to let me go.

602
01:33:31,663 --> 01:33:32,857
No.

603
01:33:33,858 --> 01:33:38,095
Just... just take me with you. Please.

604
01:33:41,787 --> 01:33:43,781
I thought I could.

605
01:33:45,049 --> 01:33:48,377
Please Papa. - I can't.
- What should I do?

606
01:33:49,080 --> 01:33:50,711
Just hold my hand.

607
01:33:55,860 --> 01:33:57,962
You said you wouldn't leave me.

608
01:34:01,712 --> 01:34:06,714
I know. I'm sorry.

609
01:34:11,415 --> 01:34:14,361
My boy.

610
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:21,015
You have my whole heart.

611
01:34:23,618 --> 01:34:25,618
You always did.

612
01:35:06,273 --> 01:35:07,673
Papa.

613
01:35:16,974 --> 01:35:18,413
Papa.

614
01:35:22,775 --> 01:35:24,175
Papa.

615
01:37:51,631 --> 01:37:53,331
Where's the man you were with?

616
01:38:03,124 --> 01:38:04,303
Your father?

617
01:38:06,033 --> 01:38:08,339
Yes. He was my papa.

618
01:38:09,581 --> 01:38:10,788
Maybe you should come with me.

619
01:38:17,099 --> 01:38:18,777
Are you one of the good guys?

620
01:38:19,402 --> 01:38:21,974
Yeah, I'm one of the good guys.
Why dont you put that pistol away?

621
01:38:22,475 --> 01:38:26,200
I'm not supposed to let anyone
take it from me. No matter what.

622
01:38:26,601 --> 01:38:29,390
I don't want your pistol. I just
dont want you pointing it at me.

623
01:38:43,898 --> 01:38:45,798
You see, you've got two choices here.

624
01:38:47,676 --> 01:38:50,673
You can stay here with your papa.
Or you can go with me.

625
01:38:53,054 --> 01:38:55,498
If you stay here, you need
to keep off the road.

626
01:39:01,447 --> 01:39:03,429
How do I know you're one of the good guys?

627
01:39:03,630 --> 01:39:05,745
You dont. You'll have to take a shot.

628
01:39:14,620 --> 01:39:15,803
Do you have any kids?

629
01:39:17,904 --> 01:39:19,572
Yes, we do.

630
01:39:22,042 --> 01:39:23,542
Do you have a little boy?

631
01:39:24,939 --> 01:39:26,939
We have a little boy and a little girl.

632
01:39:28,440 --> 01:39:31,678
How old is he?
- About your age. Maybe a little older.

633
01:39:34,596 --> 01:39:36,123
And you didn't eat them.

634
01:39:37,397 --> 01:39:38,344
No.

635
01:39:39,607 --> 01:39:43,125
So, you dont eat people.
- No. We dont eat people.

636
01:39:47,369 --> 01:39:48,569
And - 

637
01:39:49,867 --> 01:39:51,418
are you carrying the fire?

638
01:39:52,478 --> 01:39:55,783
Am I what?
- Carrying the fire.

639
01:40:00,878 --> 01:40:02,720
You're kind of weirded out, aren't you kid?

640
01:40:03,156 --> 01:40:04,960
Well, are you?

641
01:40:05,705 --> 01:40:07,133
Yeah, I'm carrying the fire.

642
01:40:09,062 --> 01:40:10,683
Can I come with you?

643
01:40:11,584 --> 01:40:12,877
Yes. You can.

644
01:40:34,536 --> 01:40:36,809
I'll talk to you every day.

645
01:40:40,331 --> 01:40:45,856
And I won't forget,
no matter what.

646
01:40:53,450 --> 01:40:55,188
No matter what, Papa.

647
01:41:25,004 --> 01:41:27,063
I'm so glad to see you.

648
01:41:28,906 --> 01:41:30,940
We were following you, did you know that?

649
01:41:32,886 --> 01:41:35,226
We saw you with your papa.

650
01:41:38,252 --> 01:41:39,593
You're so lucky.

651
01:41:44,993 --> 01:41:46,724
We were so worried about you.

652
01:41:47,801 --> 01:41:50,479
Now we don't have to worry about a thing.

653
01:41:52,733 --> 01:41:54,972
How's that sound?
Is that okay?

654
01:42:12,767 --> 01:42:14,467
Okay.
