1
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:32,955
What up, my lovely females! This is
your boy, Costa, your host for the evening.

2
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:37,194
Behind me is Thomas Kub's house.
Today is Thomas Kub's birthday.

3
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,567
And this is Project X, yo.

4
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:51,448
<i>Hey, we want some pussy</i>

5
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:59,282
<i>Hey, we want some pussy</i>

6
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:02,189
Birthday cake. Mm.

7
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:05,893
- Dax, my dick is gonna get so wet tonight.
- Excuse me.

8
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,967
Shit. Um, Mrs. Kub,
I thought you guys left already.

9
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:13,128
- So, what's getting wet tonight?
- Uh...

10
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:15,900
Nothing. I'm sorry about that, Mrs. Kub.

11
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,806
- Who's your friend?
- Don't worry about him.

12
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:21,071
We're shooting this birthday movie
for Thomas.

13
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,579
Like this day-in-the-life type thing.
No big deal.

14
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,877
He's still in the shower.

15
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,219
See you later.

16
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:34,288
Fuck me, that was close.

17
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,257
Dax.

18
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:49,841
Happy birthday, motherfucker!

19
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:52,170
Whoa, shit! What the fuck, dude?

20
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,509
- What the fuck?
- I'm jerking off to your mom.

21
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:59,277
So, dude, it's your last day
of being a loser. How does it feel?

22
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,750
You're such a dick, Costa.

23
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:03,650
Shit never gets old.

24
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:07,492
<i>Wait for another day</i>

25
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,254
What's up, Dax?
How'd they rope you into this?

26
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,295
He's one of J.B.'s guys from Gay-V Club.

27
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:15,025
He's a fucking weirdo, I know,
but he's a solid shooter.

28
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:17,829
And he's gonna make us look pimp,
and you fucking better.

29
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:20,267
Thomas, get down here!

30
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,271
Oh, shit. Let's go.

31
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,578
You said your parents would be gone by 7.

32
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:28,611
I don't wanna go talk to your fucking dad.

33
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:36,849
No food in the living room. Your mother
will kill me and I'll have to kill you.

34
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:39,116
- Here's 40 bucks for pizza, okay?
- Oh, cool.

35
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:42,159
You guys can have that.
Knock yourself out.

36
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,262
Back door or turn the alarm system off.

37
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,922
And look, Thomas, I'm not an idiot.
I know you're gonna have friends over.

38
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:50,968
- Dad, what do you think is gonna happen?
- Mr. Kub, honestly, we have no...

39
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:53,332
Mm-mm. I'm sorry. Who are you?

40
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,803
This is Dax.
What is this?

41
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:58,034
He's shooting a movie
for my birthday, you know, a little present.

42
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:01,271
Didn't know you had Goth friends.
He's just a friend from school.

43
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:02,846
Four or five friends, tops.

44
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,814
I'm just asking that you please
respect my house, okay?

45
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:07,452
All right, fine.

46
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:09,855
So leave the gate open for the gardener.

47
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:13,083
And I know I don't need to tell you,
but my car is off limits.

48
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:15,284
- Yeah, Dad, I know.
- Good. Okay.

49
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:17,759
The pool heater, don't touch it.

50
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:20,661
And also, guys,
do not go in my office, right?

51
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:24,599
I have three projects I'm working on.
I don't want anybody in there, clear?

52
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:27,103
- Get out, out, out.
- Dad...

53
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:30,004
Nothing goes in here, right?

54
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,837
Where's your mom?
I'm gonna get the bags.

55
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:37,610
What's going on? What's the matter?

56
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:39,479
- I'm just worried.
- About what?

57
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:42,177
I don't know.
Thomas, leaving him alone all weekend.

58
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:45,916
Oh, please, stop it. Come on, honey.
He's 17 years old.

59
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:47,491
That's what I'm worried about.

60
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:50,754
Let's be realistic here, okay?

61
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,161
This is Thomas we're talking about.
He's not exactly Mr. Popular.

62
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:58,065
- What is that supposed to mean?
- I'm just saying that he's not that type of kid.

63
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:02,299
He's got a couple of friends. They're gonna
hang out, but they're not gonna do anything.

64
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:04,705
He's a sweet kid, but...

65
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,803
...he's a loser.

66
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:12,784
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

67
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:16,322
- Happy birthday, Thomas.
- Whoo! Yay!

68
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:17,820
All right, honey, car is here.

69
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:19,583
- Boys, gotta get to school.
- Cool.

70
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,250
Hold on. We gotta give Thomas
his birthday present.

71
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:25,192
How cool is it that Thomas
was born on your anniversary?

72
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:27,731
What a great anniversary gift, a baby.

73
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,993
Happy birthday, sweetie.
Ahh.

74
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:32,137
- Mom's minivan? Nice.
- Yeah.

75
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:34,500
It's just for school and back.
That's it, right?

76
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:37,336
- Yes. Thank you so much.
- Cool, right? You have a car now.

77
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,102
I know.
- Okay.

78
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,908
And, Milo, you take good care of Thomas,
okay? Momma's gonna miss you.

79
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:45,277
- Okay, bye.
- All right, see you guys.

80
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,715
Every one of my phone calls
gets answered, right?

81
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:49,650
- Yeah, I know.
- Every one. Okay.

82
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:51,380
- All right, have fun.
- Bye.

83
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:53,821
Happy anniversary.

84
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:56,519
Get off me, you little faggot dog.

85
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,186
- Yeah!
- It's on, motherfuckers!

86
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:01,834
- Whoo!
- Dude, chill out. Goddamn.

87
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:06,096
It was really cool of your mom and dad
to clean it out and wash it for you.

88
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:09,036
It's a free car.
I'm not about to complain about a free car.

89
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:12,803
It's not even a car. It's a fucking minivan.
We can't even roll in this.

90
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:16,278
Dude, too bad your dad didn't give you
the Benz. That'd have been sick.

91
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:19,782
You know what, you're right, Costa.
Let's just take your car.

92
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:23,388
- Oh, you don't have one.
- Good fucking joke, good fucking joke.

93
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:25,957
So, dog, you ready for tonight?

94
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:30,186
I actually wanna talk to you
about that, you know, before we jump into it.

95
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:32,797
I knew it. You're bitching out.
What?

96
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:35,557
What? Dude, I'm not bitching out.

97
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:38,295
Thomas is bitching out
like the little bitch that he is.

98
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:41,599
- Fuck you.
- Oh, my God.

99
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,338
- Oh, shit.
- We need this party. You need this party.

100
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:49,481
I'm just nervous.
What if nobody shows up? What if it sucks?

101
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:52,948
That's not an option.
People will show up.

102
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:55,553
Look at J.B. He's like a little fat
Rain Man, texting away.

103
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:59,949
Dude, stop.
You're telling me he doesn't need this?

104
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:08,358
Holy shit, dude. Your parents gave
you the minivan? That's awesome!

105
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:11,094
- Yeah.
- Hey, Costa. Hey, Dax.

106
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:15,737
That isn't happening. That's not real.

107
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:18,001
Uh, excuse me...
Sorry.

108
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:20,441
Hey, can I get to my locker right there?

109
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:22,706
Dude, why are you staring at my dick?

110
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,343
I wasn't. My locker's there.
Can I get to it?

111
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:30,956
- Whatever, you fucking weirdo.
- Dude, just let it go. Just come on.

112
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:37,023
- Hey, that's a sweet minivan, soccer mom.
- See? See what I told you?

113
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:40,862
Is it true what I heard about you
at Zam's party?

114
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:42,500
You got a blowjob from his mom?

115
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:45,296
That party was so sick.
Everyone got laid.

116
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:47,336
Wheelchair Robert even got a handjob.

117
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,168
- Nice.
- Are you kidding me?

118
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:51,674
Why the fuck weren't we
at that party, man?

119
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:53,607
So we missed a party, dude. Big deal.

120
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,078
It is a big deal. We miss every party.

121
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:59,616
I mean, did you hear that guy?
Wheelchair Robert got beat off.

122
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:03,153
I wanna show you something.
See this? Check this out.

123
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:06,189
That's Stasia. Gorgeous, right?
That's my girl back in Queens.

124
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:09,487
We could be crushing this kind of ass,
but we need a game changer.

125
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:11,721
I mean, no one even knows who we are.

126
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:14,958
If we want to be bigtime players,
we need to make a bigtime play.

127
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:16,696
You feel me?

128
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:19,337
J.B., what the fuck, man?
Why do you have a boner?

129
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:22,167
- I don't, it's just my underwear sitting funny.
- Cover up.

130
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:24,002
That's absolutely disgusting.

131
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:27,078
It's easy to talk shit when
the party's not even at your house.

132
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:32,309
Dude, please don't back out.
This party is gonna change everything for us.

133
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:35,454
Okay. Well, I mean,
I'm the one taking the whole risk.

134
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,384
All you do is show up and drink.

135
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:39,821
You think we'd ditch you
if something went wrong?

136
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:41,983
- I'm fucking offended, man.
- Yeah, me too.

137
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:44,425
The idea behind tonight is
to get these bitches...

138
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:46,565
...to recognize us as large-scale ballers.

139
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:49,895
Back in Queens,
I had hoes blowing me on the reg.

140
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:54,062
- I started hanging out with you two. Zero!
- I just don't really see the point anymore.

141
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,641
How do you not see the point?
There's the point. There's the point.

142
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:58,834
Okay.

143
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:01,138
There's two more fucking points
right there! It's all around you.

144
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,338
Dude, I get it.

145
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:06,309
If you fuck this up, I will stab you.
I'm not kidding.

146
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,716
- Okay, no more than 20 people.
- Twenty people?

147
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:10,719
- All right, 30 people.
- Thirty people?

148
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:15,224
- To make sure my house doesn't get fucked.
- Thirty people won't change anything for us.

149
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:18,124
All right, look, okay, 50 people,
absolute max.

150
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:21,562
Fine, 50 people, absolute max.

151
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:23,929
You know, just big enough to be cool.

152
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:29,536
<i>Sand, an adversary in many ways
more dangerous than those carrying weapons.</i>

153
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,004
Mass marketing, handled.

154
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:51,490
- Shh.
- Yeah, of course, Jack. Anything.

155
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:53,859
And if you guys get there
before we get there...

156
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,297
...you can just get in the backyard
and set up...

157
00:08:56,469 --> 00:09:01,304
...and do what you gotta do.
- Dax, Dax. Go film over the top.

158
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:04,034
Okay. Really, we appreciate that.

159
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,111
Oh, uh... I have to call you back, sir.
I'm sorry.

160
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,475
What are you doing?
Get the fuck out of here!

161
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:13,050
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Guys. Hey, guys, what the fuck?

162
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:16,781
Are you fucking with me right now?

163
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:19,254
Look.
That was a business call for your party.

164
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:21,393
Who takes a shit and makes a business call?

165
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,688
Are you kidding?
Now you can shit in peace.

166
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:26,798
Come on, dude. I can't see a thing.
It's dark as fuck in here.

167
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:32,498
Dax, come on. Let's get closer.

168
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:35,674
Heh, heh.
It should be pretty cool, I think.

169
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:37,274
Basically chill.

170
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:39,104
I'm letting Costa plan most of it.

171
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:42,645
Oh, that sounds like a really
brilliant idea.

172
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:46,683
No, he's doing a good job. He's getting,
like, a bunch of booze and then...

173
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:48,615
...I think, like, a DJ.

174
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:51,621
- A DJ. Super chill.
- Ha.

175
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:55,555
Guess what Mama Kub
and Papa Kub got for...

176
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:58,891
- Baby Kub?
... Baby Kub for his birthday.

177
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:01,056
- What?
- The Kub Mobile.

178
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:03,531
- They gave you the minivan?
- For my birthday, yes.

179
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:05,534
Your parents give the worst gifts ever.

180
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:07,332
- Where's your present?
- You serious?

181
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:09,701
You haven't gotten me a present
in 10 years.

182
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,274
So?

183
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:16,637
But since I am a better friend than you,
I did get you something.

184
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:19,444
- Oh.
- I'll bring it tonight. Hey, I have to go run.

185
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,951
- Happy birthday, loser.
- Ow.

186
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:24,887
- Don't trip.
- Ow!

187
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:27,685
Oh, shit!
I'm okay! Heh.

188
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,522
Thomas, suck my cock.
What?

189
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:34,257
- "Mama Kub and Papa Kub"? Jesus.
- Yeah, those are my parents, asshole.

190
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:37,760
Damn, she's so fucking hot, dude.

191
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:41,798
- Think she'll come tonight?
- I'm not inviting her. You do this one.

192
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:45,603
Alexis won't come.
She fucks college dudes.

193
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:54,119
"Lamel"? What? I don't know any Lamel.

194
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:55,446
No, he's cool.

195
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:58,590
Guys, the last thing I want in my house
is a bunch of randoms.

196
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:01,591
Wrong. Last thing you want
is nobody at your fucking house.

197
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:05,663
The more word gets around, the more likely
these chicks will show up at our party.

198
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:09,795
Watch and learn how
Captain Big Dick does it.

199
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:15,367
Hey, girls. Just remember,
wear something tight.

200
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:20,903
What's up, sisters?
Thomas Kub's house, 8:00.

201
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,207
Come get a piece of this white chocolate.

202
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:26,044
Are you gonna be going to
Thomas's birthday party tonight?

203
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:28,345
- Thomas? Who's that?
- Who's Thomas?

204
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:35,060
That thing that dick in
the sweater vest was telling us about?

205
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:37,058
What's up, baby? Eight o'clock.

206
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,200
What are your expectations
for the party?

207
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:46,099
Get high, fuck bitches, you already know.

208
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:49,400
- I think we'll come. Can we bring people?
- Can I bring people?

209
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:51,702
Thomas Kub's house, 8:00.

210
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:00,379
Oh, shit!

211
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,244
Ahh!

212
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:07,457
What we are witnessing is truly
a breathtaking moment...

213
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:09,617
...in the life of young Thomas.

214
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:14,698
The helpless fetus is growing
a tiny, tiny penis...

215
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:20,232
...a penis he may someday insert
into this female's vagina...

216
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:26,136
...should he survive his first encounter
without her eating him.

217
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:41,816
Paper towels. Get long.

218
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:43,985
- Don't!
- Dude, get a ton.

219
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:47,564
Oh, shit. Extra-large condoms.
I'm not paying for that shit.

220
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,528
Attention, valued shoppers.

221
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:52,728
Oh, my God.

222
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:56,341
Join us for an evening of balls-deep
entertainment at Thomas Kub's house.

223
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:57,999
Dude, stop.

224
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:05,274
Hey, little buddy.
Want something to drink? Hey.

225
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:08,648
He's gonna catch him
and he's gonna get his ass kicked.

226
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:15,152
You guys, we good on OJ?
Sunny D, dude.

227
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,625
Grab it. Throw it in. I love...

228
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,162
How are we doing on eggs?

229
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,567
Holy shit, dude. It's Miles Teller.

230
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:27,702
- Dude, it is. That's him. Holy shit.
- He's so badass.

231
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:30,239
Yeah, my boy's starting
at second base for USC.

232
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:32,877
He got sent to detention once
and banged the teacher.

233
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:35,036
Mi-Tell, what's cracking, bro?

234
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:37,808
- We go to North Pass.
- Yeah, dude, big fans.

235
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,645
- Huge fans.
- Cool. Awesome.

236
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,720
Look, we're making a movie.

237
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:46,320
Invite him, man. Come on.
All right. Okay. Um...

238
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:51,691
We're having a soirée at my place tonight.
If you wanna swing by, it should be...

239
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:54,059
My boy is underselling this
like a motherfucker.

240
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:56,599
This shit's gonna be legit.
You should swing by.

241
00:13:56,769 --> 00:14:00,205
Yeah, I can't. I actually got other plans
tonight, so I might not make it.

242
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:04,365
Dude, think about it. It's on Dickens Street.
We'd love to have you.

243
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,443
- Uh, Dickens Street?
- Yeah.

244
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:08,477
That's your party? You're throwing that?

245
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:10,911
That's where I'm going.
Heard it's gonna be crazy.

246
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,847
That's my party. I'm Thomas Kub.
It's my birthday today.

247
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,579
Yeah, I heard it's gonna be unlimited
high-school pussy.

248
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:19,053
Dude, high-school pussy for days.

249
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:22,126
What? Mind your own business, lady.

250
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:24,319
How you guys doing on liquor?
You got liquor?

251
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:25,520
Uh...

252
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,963
Don't even worry about it, man.
I'll bring it, call my boys up.

253
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:31,625
- Don't want you to sweat anything.
- Thank you so much.

254
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:34,238
Hey, it's your day. Cool.
See you guys tonight, then.

255
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:36,237
- All right, cool.
- Dickens Street.

256
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:39,275
- Teller, bring your mitt. We'll play catch.
- No.

257
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:41,436
- Fuck.
- "Bring your mitt"? The fuck?

258
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:43,605
<i>Nothing like black pussy on my dick</i>

259
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:45,545
<i>Word to the motherfucking DJ Quik</i>

260
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,152
Okay, here's what I want.

261
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:51,349
Party's limited to the backyard, okay?

262
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:54,424
The house'll be locked
and the alarm'll be set.

263
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,355
- No one is going inside, all right?
- Stop.

264
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:59,656
- Throw down in the bushes?
- I don't care.

265
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:02,995
If I don't fuck a girl with big tits tonight,
I'm drowning myself.

266
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:06,228
Don't care if she's 300 pounds.
I have to fuck a girl with big tits.

267
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,305
Oh, my God.
Feel my drift, J. B?

268
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:09,566
Sure do.

269
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:14,179
I mean, I'd love to get some oral or,
you know, at least do some finger-banging.

270
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:17,110
What? Finger-banging?
Can you please elaborate?

271
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:20,342
You take your first finger,
your thumb and your middle finger.

272
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,451
Make a "come here" motion. "Come here. "

273
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:25,181
This is called "machine guns"
or "friendly scissors. "

274
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:27,791
The "circle of pleasure. "
The "itsy-bitsy spider. "

275
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,928
Tapping and circling. Tap, tap, tap.

276
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,359
Keep telling her how pretty
she is the whole time.

277
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:33,998
Shut the fuck up!

278
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,634
- Your loss, man. It's good knowledge.
- Oh, my God.

279
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:39,965
Straight up here, then take a right again.
All right, listen.

280
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:43,939
The three of us will have full access
to the house for sex and finger-banging.

281
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,304
Yes.
But no one else, okay?

282
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:48,469
Of course, bro, we got your back.

283
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:50,012
- Hey, take a right.
- Here?

284
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:52,878
You're gonna want to lock your doors.
Are you serious?

285
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:55,714
Yes, I'm serious.
Where the fuck are we going?

286
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:58,789
T- Rick's.
Gotta score some of that chronic shit.

287
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,449
Are you sure this guy's cool?
T- Rick's the coolest.

288
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,824
He's ex-military. Wait till you see
his gun collection. Fucking insane.

289
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:06,328
This place is ghetto as fuck.

290
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:09,831
Why do we have to come
all the way here? We can't just get it at school?

291
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:12,800
Where do you think the school gets it?
This is wholesale.

292
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,440
You are literally retarded.

293
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:17,802
Ah, shut the fuck up.

294
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:20,177
Ah! Fuck.

295
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:21,938
T- Rick, open up.

296
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,649
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Hey, what's up, bro?

297
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,550
- I haven't seen you in a minute, Costa.
- Yeah.

298
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:33,419
- Nice to see you.
- How are you doing? Everything copacetic?

299
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:36,152
Everything's great. You upgraded the dish.
Looks great.

300
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,296
Yeah, I fucking did, upscaled it.

301
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,125
- Upscaled it. I fucking did.
- Yeah.

302
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:42,233
- These are my boys, J.B. And Thomas.
- Hi.

303
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:45,029
All right, yeah, yeah.
Come on in, come on in.

304
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:54,341
Oh, yeah, that was a 12-millimeter
semi-automatic Mossberg Maverick.

305
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:57,914
- I'd love to go to the range with you.
- Yeah, that's a good idea.

306
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:01,348
Going on the range,
get it all out of your system.

307
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:03,888
Pretend you're killing cops, if you want.

308
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:05,990
<i>You're beautiful</i>

309
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:09,953
<i>You're beautiful, it's true</i>

310
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:14,196
<i>I saw your face</i>

311
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,858
<i>In a crowded place</i>

312
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:20,267
All right, well, I'll get your stuff.
Here, stoke up the fires, buddy.

313
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:22,339
Oh, man, you the man.
Fuck, yeah, T-Rick.

314
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,408
Yeah, kick ass with that.

315
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:26,735
Hey, can we get going?

316
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:31,714
Costa, come sit down, dude.
He's about to fucking...

317
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,853
Check it out.
What are you doing?

318
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,453
Fucking stop.

319
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,820
That's technically a homosexual act.

320
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,351
I'm coming on Santa Claus's face.

321
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:45,258
Costa, he's coming back.

322
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:47,831
- Dax, take it, take it.
- What the fuck are you doing?

323
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,662
Dude, are you stealing it?
No, we're just borrowing it.

324
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:53,100
We need a fucking mascot for the party.

325
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:56,338
Jesus Christ.

326
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:58,032
Here you go.

327
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,542
Let's do this, I gotta be at the dojo by 5.

328
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:02,111
- Absolutely.
- Cool.

329
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:07,383
See, I told you guys,
T- Rick's just a sweetheart. Mm.

330
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:09,948
Smell it, J.B.

331
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:12,955
- You little fucking cocksuckers!
- Oh, fuck!

332
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,218
- Give me back my fucking gnome!
- Fuck!

333
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:18,192
Give him the gnome back.
Give him the fucking gnome back.

334
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:20,388
No, fuck that! Just go.
Get out of here!

335
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:22,591
Oh, shit!
Oh, fuck!

336
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:27,036
Holy shit, Thomas, he's fucking wild!
He's a fucking crazy man!

337
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:29,606
Holy shit! He's gone! He fell off!

338
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:34,603
- Holy shit, man!
- Holy shit!

339
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,550
Shit, shit, shit!

340
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:43,119
That's my boy Tom! That was
some serious fucking shit right there!

341
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,721
What in the fucking world?

342
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,450
Fuck. Shit.

343
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,924
Oh, my God.
Shit.

344
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:53,197
God, dude,
he fucking cracked my windshield.

345
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:57,563
Fuck it, my cousin owns a body shop.
He can fix it, no problem, man.

346
00:18:58,036 --> 00:18:59,936
The kung fu no good here.

347
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:02,938
- Oh, fuck! Holy shit!
- Give me back my gnome!

348
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:06,839
Holy shit!
Guy's like the fucking Terminator! Jesus!

349
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:10,641
- No, he was super pissed though.
- Dude scares the shit out of me.

350
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,249
Hey, boss.

351
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:14,783
What the fuck?

352
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:17,717
There he is.
This is Everett and his boy Tyler.

353
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,721
They're running security for the night.

354
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:22,383
Are you serious? Are those nunchucks?

355
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:23,721
- Yeah.
- Oh, shit.

356
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:25,989
- Look like ninjas.
- Ninjas are fucking pussies!

357
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,598
- I love this kid.
- You know it.

358
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:29,893
With these two,
we got nothing to worry about.

359
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:31,899
- We're outside the Kub house.
- Hey.

360
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,061
- We have bogeys.
- What up, Costa?

361
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:35,638
Do I know you guys?

362
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,071
We heard about your shindig tonight.
We want in.

363
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:39,335
- You freshmen?
- Yeah.

364
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:42,071
- Get the fuck out of here, man.
- Come on, dude.

365
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:45,478
Are you still talking?
Get the fuck out of here.

366
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:46,908
Dick!

367
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:52,218
J.B., drop those bags.
We got work to do.

368
00:19:57,763 --> 00:20:00,027
Hi. Good evening, Mrs. Stillson.
My name's Oliver.

369
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,723
This is my friend Jonathan.

370
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,368
- And we're both friends of Thomas Kub's.
- Oh.

371
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,096
Yeah, we're hosting a little birthday party
for Thomas.

372
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:09,968
And we wanted to give you
the courtesy of informing you...

373
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:12,770
...that there'd possibly be
a bit of party-related noise.

374
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:16,176
I wanted to give you my number
in case you had problems or concerns.

375
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:19,283
You're a very beautiful woman.
Call me anytime you want.

376
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:22,545
- Thank you. That's very sweet of you.
- I mean that when I say that.

377
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:23,915
You are very beautiful.

378
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:26,148
A little party for Thomas. He lives there.

379
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:27,587
Am I invited?

380
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,954
- Yeah, dude, fine. Yeah, you can come by.
- Nice.

381
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:32,528
Thank you very much.
Have a good time at your party.

382
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:35,258
Thank you, I appreciate this.
Come by anytime you want.

383
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:37,095
- All right, see you.
- All right.

384
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:38,736
- Bye, baby.
- See you guys.

385
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:52,247
DJ's over there.
Cool.

386
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:55,284
- Um, got the bar set up over here.
- Nice.

387
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:57,012
- Karaoke in the pool house.
- Nice.

388
00:20:57,189 --> 00:21:00,488
Holy shit, dude!
Where'd you get a bouncy-house?

389
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:02,957
- Costa hooked it up.
- You know it, baby.

390
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:07,057
Fifty bucks extra with the port-a-potty.
And they threw these in for free.

391
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:10,599
Nice touch.
Why not? It's a birthday party.

392
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,134
You wanna help? Do something.

393
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:15,296
- Hey, Chubs, grab your twin brother there.
- Fucking dick.

394
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:18,102
- Hey, dudes, check it out.
- Yeah, like that's gonna work.

395
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:21,542
Yes, it is gonna work. Next time
your pool guy's here, he'll be like:

396
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:24,978
"Excuse me, Mr. Kub. I seem
to have found some water in your semen. "

397
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,879
That's fucking disgusting.

398
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:33,157
J.B., I thought I told you to pick up ice.

399
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:35,657
I did. It's in the freezer in the garage.

400
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:38,694
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Getting in shape for the party.

401
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:41,697
- The party's in three hours.
- It's mostly water weight.

402
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:44,995
- Wrestlers do it all the time.
- Wrestlers also wrestle all the time.

403
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,330
- Crank this thing up.
- No.

404
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:48,837
It's not gonna work
unless you crank it up.

405
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:52,474
Stop. Stop. Stop.

406
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,737
- Let's go, come on.
- Dax. Dax, help me.

407
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:57,347
- No, Dax, you're here to observe.
- Help me! Dax! Aah!

408
00:21:57,516 --> 00:22:02,681
Jesus Christ! Are you all right, dude?
Oh, my God, J.B., are you all right?

409
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:06,119
An hour from now,
this place is a fucking madhouse.

410
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:09,385
Not a madhouse, just gonna be a fun,
decent-sized party.

411
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:12,860
Relax. For you. You.

412
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:14,726
Me. Dax.

413
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,834
Thank you, I don't drink alcohol.

414
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,765
Okay, faggot.

415
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:22,737
- To one sick fucking night.
- Cheers.

416
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,874
<i>Come on over, over</i>

417
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:36,478
Shit! Come on!

418
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:39,522
Yes. How are you so fucking bad
at this game, Costa?

419
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:42,216
Shut up, Kirby.
You're killing my concentration right now.

420
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:44,362
Ha, ha! Thomas, come here!
Fucker!

421
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,429
I'm kicking Costa's ass!

422
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:48,522
Oh, watch this.

423
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,691
Shit!
It looks like I win.

424
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,201
- Fuck you.
- You guys, it's like 9:20 already.

425
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,840
Dude, relax.
People are gonna show up. I promise, bro.

426
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:58,703
- Getting late.
- I'll look like such a dick if no one shows.

427
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:02,813
Shut the fuck up. It's pissing me off that
you don't trust me to know what I'm doing.

428
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:06,212
I'm the hub of a large social circle.
I put the word out, it goes out.

429
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,875
Okay, cool.

430
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,419
- Oh, shit.
- What the fuck are you wearing?

431
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:13,114
My God.
Nice.

432
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:17,853
- You're gonna get laid, dude.
- Ladies love a guy with class.

433
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:20,293
Are you retarded?

434
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:24,394
Jesus Christ, man.
Where do you even get shit like that?

435
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:27,129
- Men's Wearhouse.
- Men's Wearhouse? Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

436
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:30,440
What is it?

437
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:34,045
Wow, dude, this is fucking...
I can't believe it fucking worked.

438
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:36,442
What did I say?
Don't doubt the master, bitches!

439
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:51,688
Dude, we done good.

440
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:53,694
Jesus, all those chicks are really hot.

441
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:55,856
They're coming in packs.
This is insane.

442
00:23:57,235 --> 00:24:00,204
<i>Beat it, I bet she let me
She been fiendin'since she met me</i>

443
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:03,068
<i>I'm the coolest shit
Especially when I throw on all my Gretzky</i>

444
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:05,937
<i>Got my Smith and Wessie to protect me
So respect me</i>

445
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,009
What up, baby girl?

446
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:12,149
<i>Andretti on Pirelli
Make a movie out the getty</i>

447
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:14,842
<i>Where my ring and my confetti?

<i>Pink rosé and chronic smelly</i>

449
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:18,982
Dude, this is way more than 50 people.

450
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:20,681
Of course it is, it's plus-one.

451
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:25,052
That's fucking Alexis, dude.
She came, man.

452
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,391
Damn, dude.
Whoa.

453
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:31,102
Thomas, this is your party,
and she's the hottest girl here.

454
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:34,261
- That better be yours tonight.
- Damn.

455
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:56,746
<i>White trash party

<i>And walk around the party without a care</i>

457
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:01,658
- Where the fuck is your drink, Thomas?
- I'm between beverages.

458
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:05,091
What the fuck does that even mean?
J.B., get this bitch a drink.

459
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:06,753
Yeah, all right.

<i>Everybody in the club gettin' tipsy</i>

461
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,297
Who's that dude with the mustache?

462
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:15,905
Oh, that's LaRosa. He graduated.

463
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:18,474
When, in 1986?

464
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:21,111
Hey, will you at least try
and have a good time?

465
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,974
Whoo!

466
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,715
Got it? You tie it?

467
00:26:24,883 --> 00:26:27,647
He's good. Ready to go.
Blast off.

<i>Pennies up at skinnies

470
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:38,422
Oh, my God, it's a flying dog!

471

474
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:48,002
I gotta record this.

475
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:49,868
Are you serious right now?

476
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:53,010
- Fuck this, I'm putting him inside.
- Let me help you.

477
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:55,711
Hey.

478
00:26:58,583 --> 00:27:01,609
Can you imagine
if your mom ever saw that?

479
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,282
<i>It's my fucking dog.</i>

480
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,945
Poor Milo.

481
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:08,792
I don't know. It's pretty funny.

482
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,293
- Maybe I'll post it on YouTube.
- No, don't, don't, don't.

483
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,761
Seriously, stop. Stop.

484
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:17,129
Come on, you're way too easy. I love it.

485
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,769
I hate you.

486
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:23,003
You'll be okay, Milo. I promise.

487
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:31,746
All right, well, um,
we better get back out there.

488
00:27:33,918 --> 00:27:35,681
Hey, yo, Kub. Hey, yo, what up, dog?

489
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:37,378
Yo, what's up, bro?

<i>Let me see what you got

- Nice party, man.

492
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:45,992
Hey, thanks. Would you guys mind
getting off my dad's car?

493
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:48,530
It's just he'll go crazy
if anything happens to it.

494

- All right.

- Thanks, man, I appreciate it.
- Yeah, no problem.

00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:55,001
Thomas! You're taking a bullet
from me right now.

497
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,403
- What is that?
- Tequila. Just fucking take it.

498
00:27:57,575 --> 00:27:59,440
- All right. Fuck, dude.
- Come here. Come on.

499
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:02,136
Ladies, who wants to take a shot
with the birthday boy?

500

- Hell, yeah.
- Whoa, uh... Oh.

501

Careful.
She's a professional. Open up.

502
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:09,317
Take it. Oh, my God,
she's got a deep throat.

503

- Okay, open up, open up. Now.
- Yeah!

Hey.

- What's up, guys?
- Well, we did it.

507
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:26,966
This is amazing. How did we get
all these people to show up?

508
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:30,369
<i>Check it out, guys.
I'm pretty sure it's that girl from Playboy.</i>

Who?
Oh, my God, it is her.

510

<i>She graduated three years ago.
She's in Playboy's Pac-10 issue.</i>

- Yeah, like that's gonna happen.

512
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,745
Well, I want to declare it, just in case.

513
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:43,217
- Whoa.
- Oh, shit.

514
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:46,083
We're fucked!

515
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:47,884
What? Oh, hey, what's going on?

516
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,823
- There's people in the house!
- Oh, shit.

517
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:52,428
- Hey, Costa.
- I'm understaffed.

518
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:55,259
- Come on, I need your fucking help, man.
- Goddamn it.

519
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:57,458
Wow. Whoa.

520
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:02,899
Hey. Hey, hi. Hi. Welcome.
Welcome to party. Welcome, welcome.

521
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,098
- Yo!
- Miles!

522
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:06,266
Little dude. What's up, man?
How we doing?

523
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:08,503
- That's Ashley, Rachel, Sarah.
- Hi, hi.

524
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,945
I brought all these people to your party.
Fucking camera creeps me out.

525
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:14,608
- Yeah, it's... Don't worry.
- Let's go.

526
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:17,346
I'm talking about the fucking people
in the house.

527
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:20,821
My parents are gonna crucify me
if anything gets fucked up.

528
00:29:20,992 --> 00:29:25,258
I don't care if everyone thinks I'm a dick.
I'm getting them out of the house. Now.

529
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,625
Fuck, hey, stop, seriously.

530
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,393
Dude, what the fuck are you doing?

531
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:33,570
- Please don't embarrass me like this.
- Hey, listen up!

532
00:29:33,738 --> 00:29:35,399
Yeah, Thomas! Whoo!

533
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:43,177
Yeah, bro! Birthday boy on the table!
That's what I like to see, baby.

534
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:44,747
- You having a good time?
- Yeah.

535
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:49,250
Come on, guys, let's start making
some drinks. Let's get crazy in this bitch.

536
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:57,822
Can I help you, sir?

537
00:29:57,996 --> 00:30:00,464
- I'm here to see Thomas.
- First and last name, please.

538
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,623
I'm Rob, the neighbor.
Who the fuck are you?

539
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,861
- I'll ask the questions, sir.
- Exactly. Get the hell out of my way.

540
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:18,205
- Rob, hey. What can I do for you, man?
- Hey.

541
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:21,045
Look, man, I don't mean to be
a dick here or anything.

542
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:24,677
Oliver came over earlier and told me
you guys were having a little party...

543
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:26,118
...but this is too much.

544
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:29,749
Yeah, we actually should be winding down,
like midnight, I mean, maybe 1.

545
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:31,225
- Is that okay?
- No, it's not.

546
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:33,728
The baby can't sleep,
Melinda works early tomorrow.

547
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:36,765
Fuck, yeah!
My boy Rob is here to rage! Mwah!

548
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:39,130
- Good to see you.
- Actually, I'm not raging.

549
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:41,363
I'm telling Thomas
it's time to shut it down.

550
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:43,530
You can't be serious.
This is a great party.

551
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:46,768
I am serious, because it's 11:30 at night.
It's time to wrap it up.

552
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:48,776
Hey, hey, hey.

553
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:51,609
Why don't we bring everyone to the back,
lower the volume?

554
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:54,115
Guys, this isn't a request.
The party's over.

555
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:57,516
I guess we're just gonna have to
agree to disagree, then, aren't we?

556
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:00,624
Listen to me, Thomas.
Either shut it down or I'm calling the cops.

557
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:02,350
Ahh.

558
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,757
Fine. Fuck it.
I'm calling the fucking cops... Aah!

559
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:06,794
Fuck!
Oh, shit!

560
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:09,593
Jesus fucking Christ!
What'd you do that for?

561
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:12,600
Are you kidding me?
I will fucking kill you!

562
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:15,637
The little fuck Tased me!
I'm definitely calling the cops now!

563
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:18,503
You punched a kid in the face!
I'm calling the cops on you.

564
00:31:18,676 --> 00:31:22,009
Do it, genius. It's all on tape.
I just saw this motherfucker record it.

565
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,705
All I got was you punching
that little child's face.

566
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,180
Fuck you.

567
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:27,613
Go home, Robert!

568
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:29,844
It was just a kid, man!

569
00:31:31,489 --> 00:31:33,582
- Are you all right, man?
- Is he okay?

570
00:31:33,758 --> 00:31:35,225
You're a fucking champion.

571
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:38,624
He sucker-punched you.
You'd own that bitch in a real fight.

572
00:31:38,796 --> 00:31:39,990
- You think so?
- I know so.

573
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:42,155
Fuck that asshole. You're killing it, bro.

574
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:44,893
- Yo, Costa, what's up?
- Yo, go in the back.

575
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:48,835
I need you to dial back like 10, 15 percent.
You can't hard-charge all the time.

576
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:51,066
All right? And lose the Taser, okay?

577
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:53,472
- Got it.
- Get down here.

578
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:55,875
We need a post
up at the cockbiter's house.

579
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:59,574
If he calls the cops,
I want you to radio it over to me, okay?

580
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:04,512
Get out of here. Go.

581
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:15,730
Alexis was eye-fucking you,
and you got college girls on your dick.

582
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,663
- You're golden!
- Dude, I'm so fucked.

583
00:32:17,835 --> 00:32:20,929
- Relax, man, everything's going great.
- Shit.

584
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:24,097
Are you fucking kidding me?
Didn't I tell you two to fuck off?

585
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,971
- Get down here now.
- Come on, there's like 200 people here.

586
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:29,636
I don't care.
T, get these freshmen out of here.

587
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:32,510
This is a party for grownups.
Let's fucking go.

588
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:34,811
Makes no sense.
This kid's younger than we are.

589
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:37,454
- How the hell did they get up there?
- Move it, fellas.

590
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:40,386
- You too, get out of here.
- That's my boy. That's my boy.

591
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:42,958
See, the kid's a pro.
We got nothing to worry about.

592
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:45,618
Dude, you heard Rob, man.
What if he calls the cops?

593
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,857
The guy isn't gonna do shit.
He punched a 12-year-old in the face.

594
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:52,764
Thomas, everything's under control.
Let's just have some fun.

595
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:55,030
I got this, okay?

596
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:00,536
Cannonball, bitches!

597
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:12,617
<i>I don't care for fancy things</i>

598
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:16,749
<i>Or to take part in the vicious race</i>

599
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,387
This is the Thomas Kub pool cam.

600
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:21,498
Dude, check it out. Check it out.

601
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,892
Whoa, whoa, whoa, read the sign, honey.

602
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:26,696
Sorry, I don't make the rules.

603
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:28,930
<i>Ray-Ban vision, these ain't no prescription</i>

604
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:32,532
No fucking way.

605
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:34,007
Dude, go over there.

606
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,112
Do you fucking believe this?

607
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:47,958
<i>In this, feelin' tremendous
Lenses darker than the tint on my Benzes</i>

608
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:49,388
Yeah! Ha, ha!

609
00:33:58,903 --> 00:33:59,961
Whoo-hoo!

610
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:07,400
- Oh, my God!
- Holy shit! Fucking insane!

611
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:15,848
Oh, my God.
Dude, that sign fucking worked.

612
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,317
You gotta have faith, son.

613
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:19,388
Would you like a glass of wine?

614
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:23,186
We've got red, we've got white.
You know, Cabernet, Merlot.

615
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:24,885
Just another beer would be great.

616
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,530
Uh...

617
00:34:26,964 --> 00:34:28,363
Here we are.

618
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:33,394
Whoa.

619
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:43,142
Wow. Okay.

620
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,515
J.B!

621
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:55,618
How did this thing get up here?
Was someone in my parents' room?

622
00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:58,819
It's a gnome. I guess he gets around.
Who cares, man?

623
00:34:58,996 --> 00:35:00,987
Well, I just don't want people up here.

624
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:03,133
Besides, it's creepy. Look at him.

625
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:07,861
- J.B., what are you looking for?
- To see if your dad has condoms.

626
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,199
I'm working on something.

627
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:11,898
Only thing you're working on
is diabetes, you fat fuck.

628
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:16,035
- Oh, dude, Alexis just texted me.
- What? What's it say?

629
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:18,842
"Body shots for the birthday boy
right now"?

630
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:21,814
- Dude, it's fucking on!
- Check it out.

631
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:24,682
- J.B., seriously, what are you doing?
- Your dad is a freak.

632
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:29,054
Stop. Give me that. Costa, stop, wait.
Costa, what are you doing?

633
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:31,422
- Replying.
Don't. Here, don't send that.

634
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:34,997
- Sent. Too late, man.
- What did you write?

635
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:38,224
"I want your ass too, Mommy"?

636
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:40,597
"I want your ass, Mommy"?
Who talks like that?

637
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:42,762
I do. The shit works.

638
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,807
Go. Go talk to her.

639
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:47,935
Oh.

640
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:06,430
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey</i>

641
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:18,272
Wait. No, wait. What are you doing?
Not like that. Not like that.

642
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,405
Like this.

643
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:25,877
Put this in your mouth.

644
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:53,605
Your turn.

645
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:56,269
Kub! House phone! House phone!

646
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:00,850
Shit. Sorry. Um...

647
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:05,685
Excuse me. Sorry. Look out.
Sorry. Sorry. Excuse me.

648
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:08,120
Oh, shit. Sorry.

649
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:17,427
Dax, close that behind you.

650
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:19,365
Shit! Dax, find the phone.

651
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:23,638
Um, right, you know what?
Fuck it, just be quiet.

652
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,267
<i>- Hello.
Thomas. Are you there?</i>

653
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:27,911
<i>- Dad, hey.
- Where have you been?</i>

654
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,842
<i>We've been trying your cell all night.</i>

655
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:33,916
<i>- We agreed all my calls would be answered.
- I know. Yeah, I'm sorry about that.</i>

656
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,553
We were out in the hot tub,
so I didn't have it on me.

657
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:38,985
<i>I don't want to find wet towels
when we get home.</i>

658
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:42,023
<i>- I want to come home to a clean house.
- Of course, definitely.</i>

659
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:45,219
<i>- We were just calling... What was that?
- Dude, look at her.</i>

660
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:47,364
<i>What was that? Thomas?</i>

661
00:37:47,531 --> 00:37:50,591
Nothing. That was Costa.
You're on speakerphone.

662
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:53,566
<i>We just wanted to call one last time
before going to bed...</i>

663
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:56,366
<i>...make sure you're all set for the night.</i>

664
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,667
Yep, all good.

665
00:37:58,843 --> 00:38:02,301
I'm actually about to
go to sleep right now, so...

666
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,244
<i>Great. Well, we'll see you Sunday.
Happy birthday, Thomas.</i>

667
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:07,976
<i>- Thanks, Dad. Good night.
- Good night.</i>

668
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,693
Holy shit.

669
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:26,393
Fuck, yeah!

670
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,299
Oh, shit, I think that's his dad.

671
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:31,703
What? I'm not here to bust anybody.
I'm just here to party.

672
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:33,537
- Ew!
- Come on, "Ew. "

673
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:35,201
Give me a break. You got a ball?

674
00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:37,176
- Yeah, man.
- Let's do this.

675
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:40,317
Here we go. Paxson for three.

676
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:42,008
Whoa, ho, ho, ho!

677
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:46,213
Up high!
Come on, dude, right here. Yeah!

678
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,415
Let me have that.

679
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,358
<i>Hey</i>

680
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,503
<i>Nasty, kid</i>

681
00:39:01,205 --> 00:39:02,399
<i>Hey</i>

682
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:06,168
What's that, dude? Hold on,
I can't fucking hear a thing you're saying.

683
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:09,106
Speak up, E.

684
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,875
What? E...
What the fuck are you doing here?

685
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:16,110
- What you gonna do about it, bitch?
- You're not invited, dickhead.

686
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,551
Fucking asshole.

687
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:24,585
Bro, what's happening?

688
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:27,822
<i>Subject is arguing with
an overweight woman, most likely his wife.</i>

689
00:39:27,998 --> 00:39:30,933
<i>She wants him to call the police.
He wants to handle it himself.</i>

690
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:33,229
<i>He's drinking. They're in the kitchen.</i>

691
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:35,770
<i>I'm upstairs. Kids are asleep. Over.</i>

692
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,339
Wait, you're in their house?

693
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:41,939
Are you fucking kidding me?
E, get the fuck out now!

694
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:45,309
Negative. I'm a ghost. Out.

695
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:48,344
What the fuck am I gonna do with this kid?

696
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:49,952
E! E!

697
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:22,413
Are you having fun?
Yeah, I'm having a good time.

698
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:24,520
It's pretty fucking crazy.

699
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:29,350
Oh, my God.

700
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:31,893
What was wrong with me?

701
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:34,997
Wow, this was before Costa.

702
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:37,634
Yeah, the good old days.

703
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:40,430
Yeah, back when you were
still in the crew, right?

704
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,937
You used to be so cute. What happened?

705
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,336
Shut the fuck up.

706
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,501
Still looks like me.

707
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:56,845
Was that weird? I'm sorry.
Shit, that was weird, wasn't it?

708
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:59,888
- No, it... It was a little weird. Heh.
- Fuck. Um...

709
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,397
Cops on the way.
Get out, everybody! Now!

710
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:10,056
Everybody in the back!
Get in the back now!

711
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:13,829
What, are you over there? Get in the back!
Cops are coming! Hurry, let's move!

712
00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:18,100
Move it, move it! Let's go! Hurry up!
Cops are coming! Everybody in the back!

713
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:20,869
Costa. Hey, Costa.

714
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:22,478
Everybody get in the back!

715
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:23,908
Hey, what's going on?

716
00:41:24,081 --> 00:41:27,414
The cops are on their way right now!
Oh, shit.

717
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:32,113
Get in the back now!
Everybody move! Let's go!

718
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:35,654
Keep going! Get in the back now!

719
00:41:36,126 --> 00:41:38,117
Get out, police.
They're on their way now.

720
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:40,820
How do you know that?
Don't ask. My boy's in deep.

721
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:43,296
Gotta clear this fucking beer out of here.

722
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:45,264
Damn it.

723
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:48,971
- Is that everything?
- Yeah. I got your chalice.

724
00:42:11,127 --> 00:42:13,061
Law enforcement currently on scene.

725
00:42:13,229 --> 00:42:16,096
Standing down, for now.

726
00:42:23,806 --> 00:42:27,367
- I don't hear anything.
- No, it doesn't sound like a party.

727
00:42:28,477 --> 00:42:31,275
Not a party that's still going, anyway.

728
00:42:39,989 --> 00:42:41,616
Here they come.

729
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:44,225
- Evening, officers.
- Fellas having a party?

730
00:42:44,393 --> 00:42:47,521
Yeah, we're having a small little
birthday gathering for my friend.

731
00:42:47,696 --> 00:42:50,324
I'm the friend, my birthday.

732
00:42:50,499 --> 00:42:52,433
Lot of cars for a small party.

733
00:42:52,601 --> 00:42:55,593
Shh.

734
00:42:56,906 --> 00:42:58,874
Shh.

735
00:43:04,447 --> 00:43:06,278
The house? Whose is it?

736
00:43:06,449 --> 00:43:08,212
Is there a problem here, officers?

737
00:43:08,384 --> 00:43:10,318
We have a noise complaint.

738
00:43:10,486 --> 00:43:13,216
- You mind if we look around?
- I'd prefer if you didn't.

739
00:43:13,389 --> 00:43:16,222
- We're not asking.
- Excuse me, I'm not a lawyer or anything.

740
00:43:16,392 --> 00:43:18,485
Doesn't the law state that
you cannot enter...

741
00:43:18,661 --> 00:43:20,925
...through a private residence
without permission?

742
00:43:22,198 --> 00:43:24,462
Is there an adult here
we might speak with?

743
00:43:24,633 --> 00:43:27,397
You're speaking with one.
I'm 18 and a half years old, sir.

744
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:31,165
And, of course, in my culture
I've been a man since my 13th birthday.

745
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:33,706
So you're telling us we cannot come in?

746
00:43:33,876 --> 00:43:36,538
With all due respect,
technically the law says you cannot.

747
00:43:36,712 --> 00:43:38,771
But what we're saying is, you may not.

748
00:43:38,948 --> 00:43:42,611
I guess both are true. The law says
you cannot because we say you may not.

749
00:43:42,785 --> 00:43:46,448
All right, all right. Props on
the "can/may" bullshit. Very good.

750
00:43:46,622 --> 00:43:48,055
No doubt. Thank you, sir.

751
00:43:48,224 --> 00:43:51,489
Just keep the noise down
to a minimum, okay?

752
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:53,184
Yes, sir. Of course.

753
00:43:53,696 --> 00:43:56,392
Don't make us come back.
You know what I mean?

754
00:43:56,565 --> 00:43:59,125
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh. Of course.

755
00:43:59,301 --> 00:44:00,393
- Good night.
- Officers.

756
00:44:00,569 --> 00:44:01,934
Night.

757
00:44:02,805 --> 00:44:06,866
"Technically the law states... "
Damn Internet.

758
00:44:07,276 --> 00:44:09,676
Everybody's a fucking attorney.

759
00:44:22,558 --> 00:44:25,550
- Fuck you.
- Dude, Costa. Seriously?

760
00:44:25,728 --> 00:44:26,820
- Fuck you.
- Come inside.

761
00:44:26,996 --> 00:44:29,556
Just come inside. Just forget about it.

762
00:44:40,943 --> 00:44:43,241
To the break of dawn, yo!

763
00:45:52,848 --> 00:45:55,180
Holy shit!
What the fuck are you doing?

764
00:45:57,186 --> 00:46:01,122
Thomas, my cousin can replace the window,
no problem. It's all good, man. I promise.

765
00:46:14,036 --> 00:46:17,631
- Where did you get this? It's my mom's.
- Come on, bro. I'm not gonna break it.

766
00:46:27,716 --> 00:46:29,684
Throw it in here, nice and low.

767
00:46:42,931 --> 00:46:44,023
They're pills!

768
00:46:44,199 --> 00:46:45,860
It's Ecstasy, bro!

769
00:46:58,447 --> 00:47:00,176
You heard about this on Craigslist?

770
00:47:00,349 --> 00:47:03,216
Craigslist, yeah. It's on the thing,
on the page, right there.

771
00:47:03,385 --> 00:47:05,615
Whoa, we are so fucked.

772
00:47:05,788 --> 00:47:08,052
Relax, man.
We need to tell Thomas.

773
00:47:08,223 --> 00:47:10,987
T- Rick's so burned out,
he probably forgot about it already.

774
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,320
This is bad.

775
00:47:13,295 --> 00:47:16,526
Mom, Dad, it's me, Thomas.

776
00:47:16,699 --> 00:47:17,893
Um...

777
00:47:18,067 --> 00:47:20,661
I'm drunk. I mean, that's not an excuse.

778
00:47:20,836 --> 00:47:25,933
Hopefully we'll meet again,
so I can explain things.

779
00:47:26,608 --> 00:47:28,337
I don't really have an explanation...

780
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:31,206
...other than fucking Costa
made me do it. So...

781
00:47:33,115 --> 00:47:34,776
- Fuck off!
- Dude, it's us.

782
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:36,247
I know.

783
00:47:38,053 --> 00:47:40,521
What are you doing in here?
The whole party's outside.

784
00:47:40,689 --> 00:47:42,213
Have you seen my fucking house?

785
00:47:42,391 --> 00:47:44,951
We have a whole day
to fix this place up. It's all good.

786
00:47:45,127 --> 00:47:49,962
No, it's not all good, okay? I mean,
what about this? What if my parents see it?

787
00:47:50,132 --> 00:47:52,896
Nobody's gonna see this shit but us.
I promise.

788
00:47:54,803 --> 00:47:56,862
Where did all these people
even come from?

789
00:47:57,039 --> 00:47:58,700
You know a guy down there told me...

790
00:47:58,874 --> 00:48:01,866
...he found out about the party
on fucking Craigslist?

791
00:48:02,845 --> 00:48:05,143
My dad met my stepmom on Craigslist.

792
00:48:05,314 --> 00:48:07,475
So you put my address
on the fucking Internet?

793
00:48:07,649 --> 00:48:10,345
- Well, not just the Internet.
- Shut the fuck up, J. B!

794
00:48:10,519 --> 00:48:12,384
Wait, what the fuck is he talking about?

795
00:48:12,554 --> 00:48:16,581
I had Jesse Marco put out an e-mail blast
and I may have called a radio station or two.

796
00:48:16,759 --> 00:48:18,056
You motherfuckers!

797
00:48:18,227 --> 00:48:20,491
You were so nervous
about people not showing up.

798
00:48:20,662 --> 00:48:23,893
Dude, people are spilling shit,
breaking shit, probably stealing shit.

799
00:48:24,066 --> 00:48:25,727
It's out of control.

800
00:48:25,901 --> 00:48:28,961
I wasn't nervous. I wanted the party
to be big enough to be cool.

801
00:48:29,138 --> 00:48:32,505
- Dude, look, back in Queens...
- I'm fucking sick of hearing about Queens.

802
00:48:32,674 --> 00:48:35,336
We get it. Queens is awesome.
We're pussies. I don't fucking care.

803
00:48:35,511 --> 00:48:37,103
<i>I'm doin'me</i>

804
00:48:37,279 --> 00:48:41,113
<i>I'm livin'life right now, man
And this what I'm gonna do</i>

805
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:43,550
Whatever happens, we can make this right.

806
00:48:43,719 --> 00:48:46,916
I'll fix this whole house myself if I have to.

807
00:48:47,089 --> 00:48:50,581
Your parents don't even come home
till Sunday. You just need to relax, man.

808
00:48:50,759 --> 00:48:53,785
- You want a massage, bro?
- No, no. Just, stop.

809
00:48:53,962 --> 00:48:55,930
This is my favorite song, guys.

810
00:48:56,098 --> 00:48:57,998
<i>But my body</i>

811
00:48:58,167 --> 00:48:59,896
<i>My body's</i>

812
00:49:00,068 --> 00:49:02,798
I can't believe, like,
you guys just did this to me.

813
00:49:02,971 --> 00:49:04,836
We did this for you.

814
00:49:05,974 --> 00:49:09,535
Look, man, I know you're not a drug guy,
and I respect that about you.

815
00:49:09,711 --> 00:49:12,179
- But right now, this is what you need.
- What is it?

816
00:49:12,347 --> 00:49:15,874
It's Ecstasy. It'll put the brakes
on your little freak-out. Just take it.

817
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:21,355
All right. This won't totally,
like, fuck me up, will it?

818
00:49:21,523 --> 00:49:24,788
Of course it will, dude.
That's the whole point.

819
00:49:26,328 --> 00:49:27,625
Here.

820
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:31,290
- Hey.
- You get half of one.

821
00:49:32,534 --> 00:49:35,059
<i>Baby</i>

822
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:37,238
All right, just give me like 10 minutes.

823
00:49:38,607 --> 00:49:40,404
No fucking way, man!

824
00:49:40,809 --> 00:49:43,039
Ow! Get off me.
This is your night.

825
00:49:43,212 --> 00:49:47,581
Cut the music. Cut it.
How's everybody doing? It's your host, Costa.

826
00:49:47,749 --> 00:49:50,582
I'm gonna bring up my best friends,
Thomas and J.B.

827
00:49:50,752 --> 00:49:52,379
Get your asses up here right now.

828
00:49:52,554 --> 00:49:54,283
Come on, move your asses.

829
00:49:54,823 --> 00:49:56,552
Come on, J.B., move your fat ass.

830
00:49:56,725 --> 00:50:00,593
The reason you guys are here tonight
is because it's Thomas Kub's birthday.

831
00:50:00,762 --> 00:50:04,823
And we're gonna sing a little
"Happy Birthday" for him. One, two, three.

832
00:50:05,234 --> 00:50:09,694
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

833
00:50:09,872 --> 00:50:14,571
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

834
00:50:14,743 --> 00:50:20,045
<i>Happy birthday dear Thomas</i>

835
00:50:20,749 --> 00:50:24,446
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

836
00:50:26,822 --> 00:50:29,689
Thanks, everybody, for coming.
Let's get the music rocking!

837
00:50:29,858 --> 00:50:31,883
<i>Let's fucking lose it</i>

838
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:34,255
<i>Get out of your mind</i>

839
00:50:34,429 --> 00:50:36,659
<i>Get out of your mind</i>

840
00:50:36,832 --> 00:50:39,665
<i>Get out of your mind
Fuck that shit</i>

841
00:50:39,835 --> 00:50:43,635
Fuck, yeah! What's up in this bitch?
Fuckers.

842
00:50:43,805 --> 00:50:46,273
Hey, baby, what's up?
Want some of this?

843
00:50:46,441 --> 00:50:49,501
Yeah!
The fuck you guys looking at?

844
00:50:50,279 --> 00:50:52,270
Whoa!

845
00:50:52,447 --> 00:50:54,881
- You got something to say?
- Buddy, what...? What the...

846
00:51:01,056 --> 00:51:03,616
Let me go! Goddamn it!

847
00:51:04,026 --> 00:51:05,653
Don't shut that...

848
00:51:05,827 --> 00:51:08,625
<i>Scuffin'shell-toes
Is that nigga dead?</i>

849
00:51:08,797 --> 00:51:10,856
Hey, have you seen Thomas?

850
00:51:11,033 --> 00:51:12,694
We're looking for him.

851
00:51:12,868 --> 00:51:16,099
Well, when you find him, can you tell him
I've got something for him?

852
00:51:16,838 --> 00:51:18,066
Jump in.

853
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,538
You're breaking the rules, you know.

854
00:51:22,544 --> 00:51:24,171
Ew. Heh.

855
00:51:24,346 --> 00:51:26,712
Why won't you get in with me?

856
00:51:26,882 --> 00:51:30,443
It's just, like, I already went
swimming once against my will.

857
00:51:30,986 --> 00:51:32,647
Wetness.

858
00:51:33,055 --> 00:51:35,114
Ha, ha. Whoa.

859
00:51:35,290 --> 00:51:37,224
So, Thomas, are you having fun?

860
00:51:38,393 --> 00:51:39,587
- No.
- Not at all?

861
00:51:39,761 --> 00:51:42,423
- Yes.
- You look pretty fucked up.

862
00:51:42,598 --> 00:51:45,089
- I'm a little fucked up.
- But you look good.

863
00:51:45,267 --> 00:51:47,997
- Have you gotten lucky at all?
- I'm pretty lucky right now.

864
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:49,501
Slow down, dude.

865
00:51:49,671 --> 00:51:51,536
Fine. Give me that.

866
00:51:51,707 --> 00:51:54,039
- Are you having fun at this party?
- So much fun.

867
00:51:54,209 --> 00:51:57,838
It's just that it's a small get-together.
It should be basically chill.

868
00:51:58,013 --> 00:52:01,210
Look how chill this is.
It's no big deal. I mean, there's two DJ's.

869
00:52:01,383 --> 00:52:04,511
That's not a big deal, right?
When do your parents get home?

870
00:52:04,686 --> 00:52:06,677
- I don't know.
- J.B., get your fat ass up!

871
00:52:06,855 --> 00:52:10,052
There's a midget in the oven.
Let's go. Come on.

872
00:52:10,225 --> 00:52:11,886
What?
What? What did he say?

873
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:13,322
I heard, "midget in oven. "

874
00:52:16,798 --> 00:52:19,596
Move the fuck out of the way!

875
00:52:19,768 --> 00:52:21,201
Move the fuck out of the way!

876
00:52:21,370 --> 00:52:24,339
- I'm so sorry, sir. I'm so sor...
- Fuck!

877
00:52:24,506 --> 00:52:26,303
Hey, wrong guy. Wrong guy.

878
00:52:26,475 --> 00:52:29,535
- My God. Jesus Christ.
- No.

879
00:52:29,711 --> 00:52:35,877
Motherfucker! Motherfuckers!
You fucking cunt!

880
00:52:40,589 --> 00:52:42,454
Yo, yo, yo, hey!

881
00:52:42,624 --> 00:52:46,754
I just heard a rumor that all your balls
got attacked by a midget. Is it true?

882
00:52:46,928 --> 00:52:49,988
Please, please, just tell me it is.
I'm praying it fucking is.

883
00:52:50,165 --> 00:52:52,725
Dude, I can't believe I missed it.

884
00:52:54,336 --> 00:52:57,066
Look at your fucking pupils.

885
00:53:00,909 --> 00:53:02,774
- I love you guys.
- Ha, ha.

886
00:53:02,944 --> 00:53:04,343
No, seriously.

887
00:53:04,513 --> 00:53:07,277
Look, I realize I can be,
like, a huge dick sometimes...

888
00:53:07,449 --> 00:53:09,280
...and I'm really sorry for that.

889
00:53:09,451 --> 00:53:12,079
- It's okay.
- No, it's not.

890
00:53:13,355 --> 00:53:17,758
J.B., I'm sorry for buying you a bra
on your birthday. That wasn't cool.

891
00:53:17,926 --> 00:53:19,860
It wasn't cool, man.

892
00:53:20,028 --> 00:53:23,156
And I'm sorry for all the times
I called you Fat Fuck.

893
00:53:23,331 --> 00:53:24,821
Mm.

894
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,628
- Chubby Bitch.
- Yeah.

895
00:53:27,803 --> 00:53:30,465
- Fudgy the Whale.
- Okay.

896
00:53:30,639 --> 00:53:33,199
I'm sorry for that time
at your brother's Bar Mitzvah...

897
00:53:33,375 --> 00:53:36,833
...where I told everyone you look like
Rosie O'Donnell, because you don't.

898
00:53:37,012 --> 00:53:39,071
- I don't.
- Hey, guys?

899
00:53:39,247 --> 00:53:40,942
- What?
- Um...

900
00:53:41,616 --> 00:53:43,743
I hooked up with Kirby.

901
00:53:45,387 --> 00:53:47,878
I'm, like, really into her.

902
00:53:50,492 --> 00:53:53,723
Okay, seriously, Thomas,
that's, you know, cool and all.

903
00:53:53,895 --> 00:53:56,830
But she's kind of always been around.

904
00:53:56,998 --> 00:53:59,523
It's like hooking up with J.B.

905
00:54:00,202 --> 00:54:01,669
But her tits are smaller.

906
00:54:01,837 --> 00:54:04,397
- Hey.
- I'm just saying.

907
00:54:04,573 --> 00:54:07,201
Kirby's sort of like one of us.

908
00:54:07,375 --> 00:54:10,344
You know, tonight's about the girls
we never had a shot at.

909
00:54:10,512 --> 00:54:14,107
Tonight's about changing the game.

910
00:55:57,586 --> 00:55:59,019
<i>Heads will roll</i>

911
00:55:59,187 --> 00:56:00,916
<i>Heads will roll</i>

912
00:56:01,089 --> 00:56:02,522
<i>Heads will roll</i>

913
00:56:03,892 --> 00:56:05,484
It's crazy out there.

914
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:07,321
I haven't seen Tyler in an hour.

915
00:56:12,033 --> 00:56:14,058
We were slightly out of our league
on this mission.

916
00:56:19,641 --> 00:56:21,438
- Cool room.
- Thanks.

917
00:56:22,811 --> 00:56:24,403
It's a bit messy right now.

918
00:56:25,747 --> 00:56:27,578
Here, let me...

919
00:56:32,387 --> 00:56:34,582
So it's your birthday.

920
00:56:34,756 --> 00:56:37,748
Yeah, it's my birthday.

921
00:57:07,122 --> 00:57:08,646
Oh.

922
00:57:11,293 --> 00:57:13,727
<i>I know where they build 'em</i>

923
00:57:13,895 --> 00:57:17,353
<i>I know where they're selling long</i>

924
00:57:21,303 --> 00:57:25,467
<i>Wider than the worst ones
Wider than the one I know</i>

925
00:57:26,841 --> 00:57:28,968
Oh, my God. Thomas?

926
00:57:29,144 --> 00:57:30,509
Kirby.

927
00:57:30,679 --> 00:57:32,510
- Fuck off.
- I'm sorry. Hey, hey, Kirby...

928
00:57:32,681 --> 00:57:35,115
Thomas, what the fuck?

929
00:57:35,884 --> 00:57:37,613
Asshole.

930
00:57:41,723 --> 00:57:44,886
- Would you like a hand with that?
- How long have you been in there?

931
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:46,687
- Fucking shit!
- What are you doing?

932
00:57:58,573 --> 00:57:59,597
Kirby!

933
00:58:00,408 --> 00:58:01,534
Kirby!

934
00:58:52,327 --> 00:58:54,488
Alexis, are you having a good time?

935
00:58:54,662 --> 00:58:55,959
No. I'm leaving.

936
00:59:13,581 --> 00:59:17,108
<i>Hi. You've reached
the Kub residence. Please, leave a message.</i>

937
00:59:17,285 --> 00:59:19,446
<i>Thomas, it's me again.
I'm fucked, dude.</i>

938
00:59:19,621 --> 00:59:23,921
<i>I just got another call.
I'm sure the neighbors are exaggerating.</i>

939
00:59:24,092 --> 00:59:26,652
<i>- Please call me.
- Fuck.</i>

940
00:59:32,734 --> 00:59:34,463
<i>Your style and your physique</i>

941
00:59:34,636 --> 00:59:37,969
<i>And I ain't tryin' to critique
But you deserve a good drink, so, what's up?</i>

942
00:59:38,139 --> 00:59:40,164
<i>What you sippin'on?
It's no problem</i>

943
00:59:40,341 --> 00:59:43,367
<i>Black and gold bottles
Like I'm pro-New Orleans</i>

944
00:59:43,545 --> 00:59:48,573
<i>But, shorty, I'm far from a saint
But I got two AmEx's that look the same way</i>

945
00:59:48,750 --> 00:59:53,653
<i>Wale, D.C., that's me, huh
My Prada say Prada and they Prada say Fila</i>

946
00:59:53,822 --> 00:59:56,313
<i>I ain't gotta tell you
They know about me, huh</i>

947
00:59:56,491 --> 00:59:59,085
<i>Come to D.C. And I can make you a believer</i>

948
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:02,024
<i>See, baby, I'm a leader
Day away from a Libra</i>

949
01:00:02,197 --> 01:00:04,688
<i>I ain't tryin' to lead you wrong, sugar
I need you</i>

950
01:00:04,866 --> 01:00:07,130
<i>So would you please listen
To what I'm gonna need from you</i>

951
01:00:07,302 --> 01:00:09,600
<i>Live for tonight
Before tomorrow's amnesia</i>

952
01:00:09,771 --> 01:00:14,470
<i>Pretty girls
I ask them do they smoke</i>

953
01:00:15,376 --> 01:00:17,367
Holy shit!

954
01:00:18,346 --> 01:00:19,973
It's fucking insane.

955
01:00:37,065 --> 01:00:41,024
Thomas, look at what we did. Epic.

956
01:00:44,339 --> 01:00:46,899
Is this big enough to be cool?

957
01:00:48,176 --> 01:00:49,609
Game changer.

958
01:00:51,579 --> 01:00:53,240
Holy shit, it's the news.

959
01:01:00,822 --> 01:01:01,914
Dude, that's Thomas!

960
01:01:02,090 --> 01:01:05,059
<i>Thomas! Thomas! Thomas!</i>

961
01:01:05,226 --> 01:01:07,160
Are you hearing this?

962
01:01:07,328 --> 01:01:12,027
<i>Thomas! Thomas! Thomas!</i>

963
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:13,895
This is your fucking party, man.

964
01:01:14,869 --> 01:01:17,064
You're right, dude. I needed this.

965
01:01:21,276 --> 01:01:22,470
Fuck, yeah!

966
01:01:30,518 --> 01:01:34,284
Look at me now, bitches!
My party is the shit!

967
01:01:34,856 --> 01:01:37,484
My party is legendary!

968
01:01:39,994 --> 01:01:42,428
<i>Thomas! Thomas! Thomas!</i>

969
01:01:42,597 --> 01:01:44,258
- Watch this.
- Watch what?

970
01:01:44,432 --> 01:01:48,425
Are you kidding me?
Hey, all you bitches. Aah!

971
01:01:50,271 --> 01:01:52,705
<i>Know me from the you know
Boss in my Hugo</i>

972
01:01:55,677 --> 01:01:58,145
Thomas, you crazy motherfucker!
I love you!

973
01:02:01,516 --> 01:02:05,953
<i>Jump! Jump! Jump!</i>

974
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:08,884
Fuck that shit. I'm not jumping.
Fuck that.

975
01:02:09,324 --> 01:02:11,690
<i>Jump! Jump! Jump!</i>

976
01:02:14,929 --> 01:02:17,420
To my family members,
all my friends on Facebook...

977
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:19,123
- What?
- It's been a great ride.

978
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:22,394
- Costa, hold on to these.
- J.B., don't do it, man.

979
01:02:22,570 --> 01:02:24,299
- You're way too fat.
- Shut up.

980
01:02:30,945 --> 01:02:32,310
Yeah!

981
01:02:40,288 --> 01:02:42,279
Oh, my God!

982
01:02:45,159 --> 01:02:47,423
J.B., you all right, man?

983
01:02:48,129 --> 01:02:50,529
- J.B., you all right?
- Ha-ha-ha!

984
01:03:01,542 --> 01:03:02,600
This is Falcon One.

985
01:03:02,777 --> 01:03:05,746
I was just attacked
by this really sexy woman.

986
01:03:05,913 --> 01:03:08,541
We've lost all control.
The house was breached hours ago.

987
01:03:08,716 --> 01:03:10,183
Chaos has spread to the streets.

988
01:03:10,351 --> 01:03:13,115
And the police are returning in force.
We're clearly outnumbered.

989
01:03:22,030 --> 01:03:23,156
God, help us.

990
01:03:28,770 --> 01:03:30,328
Assholes!

991
01:03:38,913 --> 01:03:42,815
<i>Cops go home! Cops go home! Cops go home!</i>

992
01:03:42,984 --> 01:03:44,918
This is the police.

993
01:03:45,086 --> 01:03:48,715
Disperse peacefully and immediately
or you will be subject to arrest.

994
01:03:59,667 --> 01:04:01,430
In need of immediate assistance.

995
01:04:03,504 --> 01:04:04,698
Drive, drive, drive!

996
01:04:07,375 --> 01:04:09,673
Requesting backup, all units...

997
01:04:27,428 --> 01:04:28,486
Holy shit!

998
01:04:28,663 --> 01:04:30,563
I jumped off the house on purpose.

999
01:04:34,435 --> 01:04:36,630
<i>Chaos has broken out in the Southland...</i>

1000
01:04:36,804 --> 01:04:41,332
<i>...where this normally quiet residential
street has turned into anarchy.</i>

1001
01:04:50,985 --> 01:04:54,284
<i>I'm joined now by Captain Reesman
of the Police Department.</i>

1002
01:04:54,455 --> 01:04:57,583
<i>We'll have to let this thing burn out
before we even think about moving back in.</i>

1003
01:05:28,189 --> 01:05:30,248
Shit, that's my dad's car.
Shit, dude.

1004
01:05:31,659 --> 01:05:32,751
Oh, shit.

1005
01:05:39,333 --> 01:05:41,392
Oh, shit!

1006
01:05:52,914 --> 01:05:55,144
Are you kidding me?

1007
01:05:58,152 --> 01:06:00,416
- What are you doing?
- What?

1008
01:06:00,588 --> 01:06:02,180
Fuck your car!

1009
01:06:05,059 --> 01:06:06,151
Motherfuckers!

1010
01:06:07,962 --> 01:06:10,988
Oh, my God, Thomas, we're fucked.

1011
01:06:11,165 --> 01:06:13,133
I don't know how to fix this.

1012
01:06:14,368 --> 01:06:16,893
I don't know how to fix any of this shit.

1013
01:06:17,071 --> 01:06:21,167
I'm sorry, Thomas.
I just wanted to get some pussy.

1014
01:06:24,545 --> 01:06:27,844
<i>And something's just happening right now.
I've heard a commotion.</i>

1015
01:06:29,884 --> 01:06:31,351
Holy shit!

1016
01:06:35,223 --> 01:06:37,020
What the fuck is that?

1017
01:06:37,191 --> 01:06:38,522

Fuck! You guys, come on!

1021
01:06:49,570 --> 01:06:52,038
- Come on, get the fuck out of here! Move!

1022
01:06:52,206 --> 01:06:54,834
Go! Shit!
Come on!

1023
01:06:55,042 --> 01:06:58,034
Whoa! What the fuck, dude! Get down!

1024
01:06:58,212 --> 01:07:00,180
- Holy shit! Look out.
- Shit! What the fuck?

1025
01:07:01,749 --> 01:07:05,549
<i>Subject is armed and active.

1029
01:07:17,532 --> 01:07:21,366
- What the fuck is he doing?
- Costa!

1030
01:07:21,536 --> 01:07:24,869
Give me back my fucking gnome!

1031
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:28,304
- Give it to him. Where is it?
- It was full of Ecstasy. Everyone ate it!

1032
01:07:28,476 --> 01:07:31,343

<i>Approach with extreme caution.</i>

<i>...has survived his injuries...
Costa!</i>

1209
01:19:54,855 --> 01:19:57,653
<i>We moved to a place like Pasadena
to avoid stuff like this.</i>

1210
01:19:57,824 --> 01:20:00,918
<i>Some asshole puked all over
my front door.</i>

1211
01:20:01,094 --> 01:20:05,155
<i>Do these kids even have parents?
It's ridiculous, right?</i>

1212
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:08,630
Have you seen the footage?
Let me tell you.

1213
01:20:08,802 --> 01:20:13,000
I haven't seen that many teenage boobs
since R. Kelly's birthday party.

1214
01:21:00,554 --> 01:21:06,049
<i>Joining us now live is one Pasadena teen
who's recently drawn a lot of notice...</i>

1215
01:21:06,226 --> 01:21:08,126
<i>...for throwing what people
are calling...</i>

1216
01:21:08,295 --> 01:21:11,355
<i>...possibly the most epic
high-school party of all time.</i>

1217
01:21:11,531 --> 01:21:15,399
<i>Costa, before we begin, is there anything
that you would like to say to the viewers?</i>

1218
01:21:15,569 --> 01:21:16,729
<i>In fact, I would.</i>

1219
01:21:16,903 --> 01:21:20,031
<i>You said it was perhaps
the most epic party of all time.</i>

1220
01:21:20,207 --> 01:21:22,539
<i>It was the most epic party of all time.</i>

1221
01:21:22,709 --> 01:21:26,201
<i>Okay. I was thinking more along
the lines of an apology.</i>

1222
01:21:26,380 --> 01:21:27,779
<i>Would you like to apologize?</i>

1223
01:21:27,948 --> 01:21:30,974
<i>I got a better idea.
How about I invite you to my next party?</i>

1224
01:21:31,451 --> 01:21:33,476
<i>- What?
- Yeah, you heard me, sugar-tits.</i>

1225
01:21:33,653 --> 01:21:35,484
<i>Just make sure
you wear something tight.</i>
