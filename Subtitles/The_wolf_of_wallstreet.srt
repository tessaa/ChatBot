1
00:00:37,512 --> 00:00:41,512

2
00:00:44,512 --> 00:00:47,310
The world of investing.

3
00:00:47,348 --> 00:00:49,316
Can be a jungle.

4
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:53,445
Bulls, bears, danger at every turn.

5
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:59,356
That's why we at Stratton Oakmont.
Pride ourself on being the best.

6
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,223
Trained professionals.

7
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,286
To guide you through
the financial wilderness.

8
00:01:04,296 --> 00:01:06,321
Stratton Oakmont..

9
00:01:06,365 --> 00:01:12,462
Stability, integrity, pride.

10
00:01:14,305 --> 00:01:18,435
1, 2, 3!

11
00:01:18,476 --> 00:01:20,341
[ALL CHEERING]

12
00:01:23,513 --> 00:01:28,473
Twenty five grand to the first
cocksucker to nail a bullseye!

13
00:01:28,485 --> 00:01:31,351
come on! Let's go!

14
00:01:31,487 --> 00:01:37,289
One, two, three!

15
00:01:37,293 --> 00:01:39,352
My name is Jordan Belfort.

16
00:01:39,361 --> 00:01:42,329
Not him, me.
That's right.

17
00:01:42,363 --> 00:01:45,423
I'm a former member of the middle
class raised by two accountants

18
00:01:45,433 --> 00:01:48,425
in a tiny apartment in Bayside, Queens.

19
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:52,235
The year I turned 26, as the
head of my own brokerage firm,

20
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:54,400
I make 49 million dollars.

21
00:01:54,441 --> 00:01:59,401
Which really pissed me off because
it was three shy of a million a week.

22
00:02:02,348 --> 00:02:06,307
No, no, my Ferrari was white
like Don Johnson's in Miami Vice.

23
00:02:06,352 --> 00:02:08,320
Not red.

24
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,282
See that humongous estate down
there?

25
00:02:14,326 --> 00:02:16,351
That's my house.

26
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,253
My wife, Naomi.

27
00:02:19,297 --> 00:02:24,495
The Duchess of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn,
a former model and Miller Lite girl.

28
00:02:24,535 --> 00:02:28,437
Yeah, she was the one loop my
cock in the mouth in the Ferrari.

29
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:31,306
So put your dick back in your pants.

30
00:02:31,342 --> 00:02:34,242
In addition to Naomi and my two perfect kids,

31
00:02:34,277 --> 00:02:35,471
I own a mansion, private jet,

32
00:02:35,512 --> 00:02:43,282
six cars, three horses, two
vacation homes and a 170 foot yacht.

33
00:02:47,456 --> 00:02:53,486
I also gamble like a degenerate, I drink like a
fish, I fuck hookers maybe five-six times a week.

34
00:02:53,528 --> 00:02:56,429
I have three different Federal
agencies looking to indict me.

35
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,295
- Yeah, baby..
- Oh, yeah.

36
00:02:58,332 --> 00:03:01,426
And I love drugs.

37
00:03:05,305 --> 00:03:06,397
Okay..

38
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:08,339
- Oh, yeah..
- One more.

39
00:03:08,341 --> 00:03:10,332
- Oh, you like it?
- Yeah.

40
00:03:10,377 --> 00:03:14,403
Later that night..

41
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,321
Pull up! Pull up! We're gonna
crash! For christ sake!

42
00:03:24,323 --> 00:03:26,187
Come on!

43
00:03:27,258 --> 00:03:30,386
Just relax!

44
00:03:34,332 --> 00:03:40,236
Oh.. Fuck..
Are you okay?

45
00:03:40,237 --> 00:03:41,295
Yeah, I'm alright.

46
00:03:41,338 --> 00:03:43,272
- Alright, good.
- Good job.

47
00:03:43,273 --> 00:03:44,240
Good..

48
00:03:44,241 --> 00:03:45,434
You got in there save, alright?

49
00:03:45,474 --> 00:03:49,467
- Until next time, brother.
- Until next time.

50
00:03:55,251 --> 00:04:00,278
Yup, on a daily basis I consume
enough drugs to sedate Manhattan.

51
00:04:00,288 --> 00:04:03,223
Long Island, and Queens.

52
00:04:03,225 --> 00:04:03,486
For a month.

53
00:04:03,525 --> 00:04:05,425
Oke, Mr. Jordan.

54
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:09,395
I take Quaaludes, 10-15 times a day,
for my back pain.

55
00:04:09,396 --> 00:04:12,229
I had the role to stay focus.

56
00:04:12,266 --> 00:04:14,393
Xanax to take the eye pot ot mellow me out,

57
00:04:14,435 --> 00:04:18,234
Cocaine to wake me back up again,
and morphine, well..

58
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,227
Because it's awesome.

59
00:04:19,272 --> 00:04:20,466
Good morning, Lycon.

60
00:04:27,246 --> 00:04:29,373
But of all the drugs under God's blue heaven,

61
00:04:29,381 --> 00:04:33,374
there's one that's my absolute favorite.

62
00:04:33,385 --> 00:04:38,321
See? Enough of this
shit'll make you invincible.

63
00:04:38,322 --> 00:04:40,415
Able to conquer the world.

64
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:43,291
And eviscerate you enemies.

65
00:04:45,429 --> 00:04:48,329
And I'm not talking about this.

66
00:04:48,398 --> 00:04:51,265
I'm talking about this.

67
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:55,429
The money doesn'tjust buy you a better life.

68
00:04:55,472 --> 00:04:58,338
Better food, better car, better person.

69
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,399
It's also makes you a better person.

70
00:05:00,409 --> 00:05:03,344
You can give generously to the
church or the political party

71
00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:07,440
of your choice. You can save
the fucking spotted owl with money.

72
00:05:11,452 --> 00:05:13,386
I always wanted to be rich.

73
00:05:13,421 --> 00:05:14,479
So let me go back.

74
00:05:14,489 --> 00:05:19,391
I'm 22 years old, newly married,
and already a money crisis little shit.

75
00:05:19,426 --> 00:05:20,450
So what do I do?

76
00:05:20,494 --> 00:05:26,330
I go to the one place on earth
that befit my high-minded ambitions..

77
00:05:38,444 --> 00:05:42,402
You are lower than fucking pond scum.

78
00:05:42,414 --> 00:05:46,441
You got problem with that?
Jordan?

79
00:05:46,451 --> 00:05:48,476
- No, no problem at all.
- Good!

80
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,454
Because that's it what you are.
Pond scum.

81
00:05:51,455 --> 00:05:54,219
You job is ''Connector'', which means

82
00:05:54,224 --> 00:05:57,250
that you'll be dialing the
phone over 500 times a day.

83
00:05:57,294 --> 00:06:00,262
Trying to connect me with
wealthy business owners.

84
00:06:00,263 --> 00:06:03,357
And until you pass your Series 7,
that's all you gonna be fucking doing.

85
00:06:03,366 --> 00:06:06,267
Sit. Sit!

86
00:06:06,369 --> 00:06:10,304
Just so you know, last year
I made over $ 300.000.

87
00:06:10,305 --> 00:06:13,399
The other guy you'll be
working for, he made over a million.

88
00:06:13,442 --> 00:06:18,345
A million dollars? I can only imagine
what a douchebag that guy must be.

89
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:22,281
- Jordan Belfort? Mark Hanna.
- Yeah, sir.

90
00:06:22,283 --> 00:06:24,274
- Pleasure to meet you.
- And you as well,

91
00:06:24,318 --> 00:06:26,286
I see you already meet the village asshole.

92
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,378
Smile and dial.

93
00:06:27,421 --> 00:06:30,287
And don't pick up your
fucking head until one.

94
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,348
Hey, fuck him.

95
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,417
I'm the senior broker here,
dia isjust a worthless piker.

96
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:36,326
Why don't you blow me, Hanna?

97
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:39,389
I heard you really pitched a stock
in yourjob interview.

98
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:42,298
I had to do something to stand out, right, sir?

99
00:06:42,334 --> 00:06:44,393
I fucking love that!

100
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:47,337
- Lunch, today.
- Ya, alright.

101
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:52,366
Oh, we don't start dinning at 9:30, because
our clients, they're already answering the phone.

102
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:55,277
3, 2, 1!

103
00:06:55,313 --> 00:06:57,372
Let's fuck!

104
00:06:58,249 --> 00:07:00,183
You want to know what money's sound like?

105
00:07:00,218 --> 00:07:02,276
Go to the trading floor on wall street.

106
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,254
Fuck this shit that, cunt, cock, asshole.

107
00:07:05,255 --> 00:07:08,224
I couldn't believe how this
guys talk to each other.

108
00:07:08,392 --> 00:07:11,327
I was hooked within seconds.

109
00:07:11,428 --> 00:07:13,395
It was like mainlining adrenaline.

110
00:07:13,462 --> 00:07:16,295
Fuck face! Look where
you start at today, huh?

111
00:07:16,298 --> 00:07:19,199
Motherfucker, you can't get anywhere,
and at 40..

112
00:07:19,201 --> 00:07:21,260
- Pick up the cock sucking phone!
- Yes, sir.

113
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,237
- Yes, sir.
- Market has been raise well.

114
00:07:24,239 --> 00:07:26,264
You are such a fucking dougchebag, Hanna.

115
00:07:26,307 --> 00:07:29,299
We don't give to shit about
how technology work.

116
00:07:29,344 --> 00:07:32,210
Because all we care about is
getting fucking rich!

117
00:07:32,212 --> 00:07:34,237
- Solid!
- Jordan Belfort

118
00:07:36,216 --> 00:07:36,477
I got it!

119
00:07:36,483 --> 00:07:38,314
Time to play the tape!

120
00:07:38,352 --> 00:07:41,287
Wow! a 20.000 Microsoft!

121
00:07:41,288 --> 00:07:42,413
Go in the hole!

122
00:07:42,455 --> 00:07:48,291
Come on! It's alive, it's alive.
I want you to hold on, that is hot.

123
00:07:48,327 --> 00:07:52,263
Here! In, in! Shut that
motherfucker! Shut it! Shut it!

124
00:07:52,265 --> 00:07:53,424
Salut!

125
00:08:20,323 --> 00:08:21,347
Tootski?

126
00:08:21,391 --> 00:08:23,359
Oh, no, no thank you, thou.

127
00:08:23,359 --> 00:08:26,327
Mr. Hanna, what can I bring for
you on this glorious afternoon?

128
00:08:26,361 --> 00:08:29,228
Well, Hactor heres the game plan.

129
00:08:29,231 --> 00:08:32,291
You gonna bring us two absolut
martinis, you know how I like em.

130
00:08:32,334 --> 00:08:37,270
Straight up, and then precisely seven and a half
minute after that you gonna bring us two more,

131
00:08:37,305 --> 00:08:43,437
And then two more after that every 5
minutes until one of us passes the fuck out.

132
00:08:43,444 --> 00:08:45,274
An excellent strategy, sir.

133
00:08:45,312 --> 00:08:47,337
Oh, I'm good with water for now, thou.

134
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,438
Thank you.

135
00:08:48,448 --> 00:08:50,313
It's her first day on
wall street.

136
00:08:50,383 --> 00:08:52,317
Give him time..

137
00:08:52,319 --> 00:08:55,412
Thank you. Thank you.

138
00:08:55,421 --> 00:09:01,326
Mr. Hanna, you're able to drugs
during the day and still function?

139
00:09:01,327 --> 00:09:02,351
And still do yourjob?

140
00:09:02,394 --> 00:09:05,226
Well, how the fuck else would you
do these job?

141
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,458
Cocaine and hookers, my friends.

142
00:09:06,464 --> 00:09:08,398
Right..

143
00:09:09,367 --> 00:09:14,236
I got to say, I'm incredibly excited
to be a part of your firm, I mean..

144
00:09:14,272 --> 00:09:18,367
- Your.. The clients you have were absolutly..
- Talked the clients.

145
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:22,311
Your only responsibility is
to put meat on the table.

146
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,446
You got a girlfriend?

147
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:28,212
I'm new married, I have a wife,
his name Theresa. She cut hair.

148
00:09:28,251 --> 00:09:29,377
- Congratulation.
- Thank you.

149
00:09:29,385 --> 00:09:31,182
Think about Theresa.

150
00:09:31,187 --> 00:09:34,315
Named a game, move the money from your
clients pocket.

151
00:09:34,357 --> 00:09:36,221
into your pocket.

152
00:09:36,224 --> 00:09:41,457
Right. But if you can make the clients
money, at the same time, isn't that
advantageous everyone, correct?

153
00:09:41,463 --> 00:09:46,365
No, okay, number one rule of wall street.

154
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:51,394
Nobody.. Okay, if you Warren Buffet or Jimmy
Buffet, nobody knows.

155
00:09:51,438 --> 00:09:55,340
If a stock's going up, down
orsideways fucking in circle,

156
00:09:55,342 --> 00:09:57,309
At least of all stock brokers, right?

157
00:09:57,343 --> 00:09:59,402
It's all in ''Furgazy''.
you know what Furgazy is?

158
00:09:59,445 --> 00:10:02,209
Yeah, ''Furgazy''..
It's a fake..

159
00:10:02,215 --> 00:10:05,343
Yeah, Furgazy, it's
fegazy, it's a wuzzy, it's..

160
00:10:05,385 --> 00:10:07,318
Fairy dust, it doesn't exist.

161
00:10:07,319 --> 00:10:10,379
It's never landed, that is no matter,
it's not on the elemental charge.

162
00:10:10,422 --> 00:10:13,482
It's not fucking real! Alright?

163
00:10:13,492 --> 00:10:14,424
Alright.

164
00:10:14,426 --> 00:10:16,394
Stay with me.

165
00:10:16,395 --> 00:10:19,363
We don't create shit.
We don't build anything.

166
00:10:19,397 --> 00:10:21,297
- No.
- So, if you got a client.

167
00:10:21,332 --> 00:10:24,358
who brought a stock at 8,
and now it's at 16.

168
00:10:24,368 --> 00:10:27,201
He is all fucking happy, he is
want to cash it, and liquidate.

169
00:10:27,238 --> 00:10:28,431
Take his fucking money and run home.

170
00:10:28,471 --> 00:10:30,302
You don't let them do that.

171
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,308
- Okay.
- Because that would make it real.

172
00:10:32,309 --> 00:10:34,243
- Right.
- Now, what do you do?

173
00:10:34,277 --> 00:10:36,302
You got another brainer idea.

174
00:10:36,313 --> 00:10:37,405
The special idea.

175
00:10:37,414 --> 00:10:42,350
Another situation, another stock,
to reinvested his earning in this stock.

176
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:46,412
And he will, every single time.
As they're fucking addicted.

177
00:10:46,455 --> 00:10:49,446
And you just keep doing this,
again, and again, and again.

178
00:10:49,457 --> 00:10:53,154
Meanwhile, he think,
he is getting shit rich.

179
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,456
Which he's is, on papper.

180
00:10:54,462 --> 00:10:56,327
But you and me, the brokers?

181
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,332
We taking the whole hot cash.

182
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:01,232
The via commision, motherfucker!

183
00:11:01,234 --> 00:11:03,202
Right!

184
00:11:03,437 --> 00:11:05,371
That's incredible, sir.

185
00:11:05,405 --> 00:11:07,270
I can't tell you how excited I am.

186
00:11:07,307 --> 00:11:08,274
You should be.

187
00:11:08,308 --> 00:11:12,334
There is two keys, to success,
in broker business.

188
00:11:12,378 --> 00:11:14,403
First of all..

189
00:11:16,248 --> 00:11:18,375
- You gotta stay relax..
- Yeah.

190
00:11:18,417 --> 00:11:24,184
- You jerk off?
- Do I jerk off? Yeah.

191
00:11:24,189 --> 00:11:25,247
Yeah, I jerk off, yeah.

192
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:27,224
How many time a week?

193
00:11:27,325 --> 00:11:30,418
Like, 3-4 time, maybe..

194
00:11:30,427 --> 00:11:34,227
Gotta pump those numbers out, those
are rookie numbers in this racket.

195
00:11:34,231 --> 00:11:38,292
I, myself, I jerk off, at least twice a day.

196
00:11:38,335 --> 00:11:40,199
- Wow!
- Once in the morning.

197
00:11:40,203 --> 00:11:42,330
Right after I work out,
and then once right after the lunch.

198
00:11:42,372 --> 00:11:43,304
Really?

199
00:11:43,306 --> 00:11:46,400
Well, I want to,
that's not the way I do it.

200
00:11:46,409 --> 00:11:49,344
I do it, because I fucking need to.

201
00:11:49,412 --> 00:11:52,403
Think about you doing with numbers,
all day long.

202
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:56,315
Desk more point, high frequensy, bang-bang.

203
00:11:56,318 --> 00:12:01,414
Fucking digits kick, kick, kick,
and all very asidick above the shoulders.

204
00:12:01,455 --> 00:12:02,387
Right?

205
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:04,324
You can't go weeks the people out.

206
00:12:04,358 --> 00:12:07,327
Right? You got to feed the gizz
to keep the blood flowing.

207
00:12:07,328 --> 00:12:09,353
And keep the ryhtme below the belt.

208
00:12:09,397 --> 00:12:10,364
Done.

209
00:12:10,364 --> 00:12:13,298
This is not a tip, this is
a perscription. Trust me.

210
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:16,302
If you don't, you'll fall out the balance.

211
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:18,395
Glicth your differasion,
and the tip fuck over.

212
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:19,394
Or more shit.

213
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:20,395
I've seen this happen.

214
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,428
In blood.

215
00:12:21,473 --> 00:12:24,237
- No, I don't want blooded, sir.
- No.

216
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,268
- No you don't. Ya.
- I in for a long run, you know?

217
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:27,438
- Implusion are ugly.
- Ya.

218
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:30,210
Pop off to the bathroom,
work on that anytime you can.

219
00:12:30,215 --> 00:12:31,204
And when you get really good at it.

220
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,343
You'll be fucking stroking it,
and you'll be thinking about money.

221
00:12:35,219 --> 00:12:37,346
Second key.

222
00:12:37,355 --> 00:12:38,344
To success.

223
00:12:38,423 --> 00:12:42,381
In this rackets, is this little
baby right here, it's called Cocaine.

224
00:12:42,392 --> 00:12:43,324
Right.

225
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,351
It'll keep you sharp between the ears.

226
00:12:45,362 --> 00:12:48,160
You'll also got your finger dial faster.

227
00:12:48,165 --> 00:12:49,291
And guess what.

228
00:12:49,332 --> 00:12:51,300
That's good for me.

229
00:12:51,301 --> 00:12:53,268
Yes, sir.

230
00:12:53,335 --> 00:12:56,236
- Revolution, you follow?
- Revolution.

231
00:12:56,272 --> 00:12:58,399
Keep the client on the fairys will.

232
00:12:58,441 --> 00:13:02,274
And it goes, the park is open 24/7365.

233
00:13:02,277 --> 00:13:05,337
Every decade, every goddamn century.

234
00:13:05,346 --> 00:13:07,246
That's it.

235
00:13:07,248 --> 00:13:09,273
Named the game.

236
00:13:10,251 --> 00:13:11,275
How tickity?

237
00:13:11,286 --> 00:13:14,220
Mmm... Thank you.

238
00:13:24,397 --> 00:13:26,422
Come on.

239
00:13:30,436 --> 00:13:33,166
With combine of dominator

240
00:13:41,379 --> 00:13:43,142
Keep that for me.

241
00:13:43,181 --> 00:13:44,442
# The CEO

242
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,416
# Had the money comes in

243
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,441
# The pray comes down.

244
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:50,386
# Going down to Broadway.

245
00:13:50,421 --> 00:13:52,355
# It's a one way street.

246
00:13:52,389 --> 00:13:54,413
# Which is a way I go.

247
00:13:58,261 --> 00:14:01,389
For the next six months I got to know
in and out of Wall Street.

248
00:14:01,431 --> 00:14:06,265
Earning shit money, as I
gear up, to take my series 7.

249
00:14:09,204 --> 00:14:13,265
Ow! Oh God!
That was..

250
00:14:19,347 --> 00:14:23,340
Then I was an licensed brooker at last.

251
00:14:23,351 --> 00:14:25,375
Ready to make my fotune.

252
00:14:25,418 --> 00:14:30,412
My first day as a future
master of the universe.

253
00:14:34,194 --> 00:14:37,185
October 19, 1987.

254
00:14:37,229 --> 00:14:40,164
I've X on 86 from six month ago.

255
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:42,225
Today is draining to 36 in the half.

256
00:14:42,268 --> 00:14:45,294
Mr. Buns! Mr..

257
00:14:47,338 --> 00:14:49,397
They called it, The black monday.

258
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:55,276
No shit, by 4 PM, the market
has dropped 508 poin.

259
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,271
The biggest plomits since the crash of 29.

260
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:00,146
I know you family,
you know mine!

261
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:03,119
No, I don't know, from fucking
country are you or shit.

262
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:04,245
Let them do what they want fucking do.

263
00:15:04,288 --> 00:15:05,220
Our market are out.

264
00:15:05,222 --> 00:15:07,155
Sir, this is not something you want to sale!

265
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:09,181
You know what happened?
A fucking Tsunami.

266
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:12,291
Yeah, I.. Yes, I will talk to your wife.

267
00:15:12,295 --> 00:15:15,196
You not answering the phone,
alot of people gonna be calling you.

268
00:15:15,231 --> 00:15:16,255
Trying to get your dirty laundy.

269
00:15:16,265 --> 00:15:17,322
You don't know what's going on here.

270
00:15:17,332 --> 00:15:19,323
I know, I know.

271
00:15:28,409 --> 00:15:35,281
Holy fucking shit.

272
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:37,349
Unbelieveable..

273
00:15:37,383 --> 00:15:40,216
My first shity day as a brooker.

274
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:47,352
Within a month, L.F. Rothschild, an institution
since 1899, closed it's doors.

275
00:15:47,392 --> 00:15:53,353
Wall street did swallow me up,
and shit me right back out again.

276
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,426
We can pawn our engagement ring.

277
00:15:57,169 --> 00:15:58,294
If we needed to.

278
00:15:58,302 --> 00:15:59,394
- Baby..
- Beside that is mine..

279
00:15:59,437 --> 00:16:02,338
- If we need to, I'm just saying.. Okay.
- You listen to me..

280
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,399
You're not pawning anything, okay?

281
00:16:04,408 --> 00:16:06,205
- Okay.
- What I always tell you?

282
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:07,268
You going to be a millionaire.

283
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:11,304
That's right, okay? So let me look,
I'll find something.

284
00:16:11,348 --> 00:16:13,179
- How about this?

285
00:16:13,183 --> 00:16:14,275
''Nobody beats the wiz''

286
00:16:14,317 --> 00:16:16,376
Electronic store, stock boy.
What'd you think?

287
00:16:16,386 --> 00:16:18,183
You not gonna work at that place.

288
00:16:18,188 --> 00:16:20,417
- Yeah, but you know, you start off..
- Jordan, you're gonna be miserable at that place.

289
00:16:20,456 --> 00:16:21,354
If you go there.

290
00:16:21,357 --> 00:16:23,382
It's sales, it work a way out,
I'd be a gentleman.

291
00:16:23,425 --> 00:16:25,222
You're not gonna be stock boy.

292
00:16:25,261 --> 00:16:27,388
- Why not?
- Because you are a Stock brooker.

293
00:16:27,396 --> 00:16:30,262
Do you understand there is nobody
hiring stock brooker right now?

294
00:16:30,298 --> 00:16:31,390
You understand that?

295
00:16:31,432 --> 00:16:33,366
Okay?

296
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:40,169

00:17:37,192 --> 00:17:39,422
Of course you never have it,

Jordan, what do you get
from that Blue Chip stock?

354
00:19:13,312 --> 00:19:15,108
I make 1 percent.

355
00:19:15,147 --> 00:19:16,307
Well, I didn't make 1 percent.

356
00:19:16,314 --> 00:19:18,373
Pink sheets is 50.

357
00:19:20,385 --> 00:19:23,115
It's 50 percent?

358
00:19:23,221 --> 00:19:24,380
50 percent commission?

359
00:19:24,422 --> 00:19:26,322
- Yeah.

360
00:19:26,357 --> 00:19:29,349
It's our market price services.

361
00:19:29,427 --> 00:19:36,127
So if I sells stock at $ 10.000,
my commission is $ 5.000?

362
00:19:36,132 --> 00:19:41,365
If you sell $ 10.000 worth on this stock, I
will personaly give you a blow job for free.

363
00:19:42,272 --> 00:19:44,331
And I hope it's happens.

364
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,142
Hallo, John, how are you doing today?

365
00:19:48,143 --> 00:19:50,373
You mailed my company a post card
for a few week back.

366
00:19:50,412 --> 00:19:54,348
requesting information on Peny stock
that had huge upside potential?

367
00:19:54,383 --> 00:19:57,215
With very little down side risks.
Is that ringing a bell?

368
00:19:57,218 --> 00:19:58,242
Oh, yeah, I interesting on that.

369
00:19:58,252 --> 00:19:59,150
Okay, great.

370
00:19:59,187 --> 00:20:01,280
Well, the reason for the call today, John, is..

371
00:20:01,289 --> 00:20:07,249
Something just come across my desk,
John, it is a packs is the best thing
I've seen in all last 6 month.

372
00:20:07,294 --> 00:20:10,263
If you have 60 seconds, I'll like to share
the idea with you, you got minute?

373
00:20:10,263 --> 00:20:12,197
- Say it, I really interesting on that.
- Name of the company..

374
00:20:12,232 --> 00:20:16,258
Aerotyne International, it is
a cutting edge high tech firm,

375
00:20:16,268 --> 00:20:19,362
Out of the midwest.
Awaiting imminent path approvall

376
00:20:19,405 --> 00:20:25,401
On a next generation of radar detectors that had
both huge military and survilliance application.

377
00:20:25,411 --> 00:20:30,279
Now, right now, John, the stock trade
over the count of 10 cent a share.

378
00:20:30,315 --> 00:20:31,373
And by the way, John.

379
00:20:31,382 --> 00:20:35,182
Our analysis indicated it can go
way hack of lot higher than that.

380
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:41,249
Your profit, on a mare $ 6.000 investment,
would be up to $ 60.000.

381
00:20:41,258 --> 00:20:43,192
- Jesus! That's my Mortage, man.
- Exactly.

382
00:20:43,227 --> 00:20:44,353
You could pay off your mortage.

383
00:20:44,361 --> 00:20:46,124
This stock would be safe, right?

384
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:49,257
John, one thing I can promise you,
even in this market.

385
00:20:49,298 --> 00:20:52,392
Is that I never asked my
clients to judge me on my wins

386
00:20:52,435 --> 00:20:56,371
I asked them to judge me on my loses,
becuase I have so few.

387
00:20:56,372 --> 00:20:58,236
And in the case of Aerotyne.

388
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,175
Based on every technical
factor out there, John.

389
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:04,304
We're looking at the grandslam homerun.

390
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,404
Okay, let's do it.

391
00:21:05,413 --> 00:21:07,176
I'll do $ 4.000.

392
00:21:07,214 --> 00:21:09,273
$ 4.000, that'll be $ 40.000 share, John.

393
00:21:09,283 --> 00:21:12,275
Let me lock in that trade right now,
and get back to my secretary

394
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,344
with exact information,
sound good, John?

395
00:21:14,355 --> 00:21:15,322
- Yeah, that's sound good.
- Great.

396
00:21:15,356 --> 00:21:19,121
Hei, John, thank you for
your vote of confidence.

397
00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:20,319
And welcome to the Investor Center.

398
00:21:20,326 --> 00:21:23,227
- Yeah, thanks alot, man.
- Bye-bye.

399
00:21:26,266 --> 00:21:29,200
How'd you fucking do that?

400
00:21:30,335 --> 00:21:33,099
Just like that I made 2 grand.

401
00:21:33,138 --> 00:21:36,335
The other guys looked at me like
I just discovered 5.

402
00:21:37,176 --> 00:21:38,301
Great! Even better!

403
00:21:38,309 --> 00:21:40,368
I'm selling garbage to garbageman.

404
00:21:40,411 --> 00:21:42,379
And making cash hand over the fish.

405
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:45,372
the only problem you can have
is you can't buy more.

406
00:21:45,383 --> 00:21:47,112
Boom shoot!

407
00:21:47,151 --> 00:21:48,209
So I was salling them shit.

408
00:21:48,219 --> 00:21:49,116
Way to go!

409
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:50,177
The way I looked at it.

410
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,279
Their money was better off from my pocket.

411
00:21:52,322 --> 00:21:54,381
I knew how to spend it better.

412
00:21:54,391 --> 00:21:56,188
Excuse me.

413
00:21:56,226 --> 00:21:57,386

414
00:21:57,394 --> 00:21:59,156

- It's a nice ride.
- Thanks, man.

416
00:22:00,429 --> 00:22:01,396
Donnie Asoff.

417
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:04,194

418
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,259

Don't tell fucking Susan,
It's not her business.

458
00:23:37,183 --> 00:23:40,346
And there is another thing about him too,
like his phosphorescent white teeth

459
00:23:40,353 --> 00:23:42,149
Wife? I gotta fucking deal with you wife?

460
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:46,180
and the fact that he wore horn rims
with clear lensesjust to look more Waspy.

461
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:49,354
Then with these rumors

462
00:23:49,395 --> 00:23:52,091
I've heard some stupid shit,
I don't know..

463
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:53,324
Look, I don't want to bring it out.

464
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:55,196
This isjust stupid.

465
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:56,222
It's was with me?

466
00:23:56,267 --> 00:24:01,364
You know, people say shit, I don't know,
I didn't listen to them talk.

467

Every person you had on phone, they want to
get rich, and they want get rich quickly.

569
00:28:41,324 --> 00:28:42,313

00:28:42,358 --> 00:28:45,191
Yeah, there is one time, that I
was selling a pot, on this Amish dude,

You know this guy, he got like a beard..

They did buying shit.

I'm not talking about Buddhas
or Amish.

00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:31,147
Chaster the creep chinaman, though
jitjitsu was in Israel.

620
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:33,249
The smartest from a bunch,
was Nicky Kascov.

621
00:30:33,259 --> 00:30:35,158
He actually went to law school.

622
00:30:35,193 --> 00:30:39,152
I called him, Rugred, because
of his piece of shit hair piece.

623
00:30:39,197 --> 00:30:43,065
Still give them to me,
young, hungry, and stupid.

624
00:30:43,101 --> 00:30:46,297
And in no time, I'm make them rich.

625
00:30:48,072 --> 00:30:49,300
Oh, my God.

626
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:52,173
- Jordan that..
- You like it, baby?

627
00:30:52,176 --> 00:30:54,303
Ya, I mean, it's beautiful.

628
00:30:54,345 --> 00:30:58,246
They're not the biggest stone in the world,
but I promised they're really high quality.

629
00:30:58,248 --> 00:31:02,184
It beautiful.. I..
That so beautiful..

630
00:31:02,218 --> 00:31:03,344

631
00:31:03,353 --> 00:31:06,321
- What?

632
00:31:06,355 --> 00:31:09,324
- What is it? Go ahead..
- I don't know.. It's you know..

633
00:31:09,358 --> 00:31:14,227
This stock that this company..
They're.. They're like crappy companies.

634
00:31:14,229 --> 00:31:16,128
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay.

635
00:31:16,164 --> 00:31:17,324
Yeah, they're terrible.

636
00:31:18,099 --> 00:31:21,068
Don't worry about it, I've told you,
what I'm doing is completely legal.

637
00:31:21,069 --> 00:31:24,232
Yeah, I know, but they're still not
gonna making more money, thou, right?

638
00:31:25,106 --> 00:31:27,130
Well, sometime they do, sometimes they don't.

639
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,232
You know, how it goes.

640
00:31:28,275 --> 00:31:31,176
Well, won't you feel better if you
sell this to rich people

641
00:31:31,178 --> 00:31:33,305
who making fortune from their money?

642
00:31:35,215 --> 00:31:37,182
Of course.

643
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:40,117
But rich people
didn't buy penny stocks.

644
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:41,347
They're just don't.

645
00:31:41,353 --> 00:31:44,083
Why not?

646
00:31:45,191 --> 00:31:47,181
Because they're too smart.

647
00:31:47,225 --> 00:31:48,249
That's why not.

648
00:31:48,293 --> 00:31:51,194
I mean, what person that collage education.

649
00:31:51,196 --> 00:31:53,187
Will trust this bunch of jerkoff.

650
00:31:53,231 --> 00:31:54,129
Tell him to call back!

651
00:31:54,132 --> 00:31:56,191
- We have 5 fucking grand on, right now.
- Hey!

652
00:31:56,234 --> 00:31:59,202
But what if they didn't sound like
a bunch of jerkoff?

653
00:31:59,236 --> 00:32:03,070
What if I can teach them how
to sell to the people with money.

654
00:32:03,107 --> 00:32:05,075
Real money.

655
00:32:05,075 --> 00:32:07,168
So I decided to reinvented the company.

We're new company.

670
00:32:44,177 --> 00:32:45,269
With a new name.

671
00:32:45,278 --> 00:32:49,179
A company, that our clients can believe in.

672
00:32:49,181 --> 00:32:52,116
A company that our clients can trusted.

673
00:32:52,117 --> 00:32:54,085
A firm whoes roots,

674
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:56,212
are so deeply in betting on wall street.

675
00:32:56,255 --> 00:32:58,223
That our very founders..

676
00:32:58,223 --> 00:33:00,156
Sale over of the mail flower.

677
00:33:00,158 --> 00:33:04,185
And chizel the name Stratton Oakmont
right into a fucking rock!

678
00:33:04,228 --> 00:33:06,093
You got it?

679
00:33:06,197 --> 00:33:08,062
What are we gonna do are these.

680
00:33:08,065 --> 00:33:11,158
First we pitch them Dysney, TNT, IBM.

681
00:33:11,201 --> 00:33:13,192
Blue Chip Stock's exclusively.

682
00:33:13,203 --> 00:33:15,262
Companies this people know.

683
00:33:15,305 --> 00:33:17,205
Once we sucked them in.

684
00:33:17,207 --> 00:33:19,300
We unload the dark shit.

685
00:33:19,309 --> 00:33:22,106
The pink sheets. The penny stocks.

686
00:33:22,144 --> 00:33:23,236
Where we make the money.

687
00:33:23,245 --> 00:33:26,078
50 %% commission, baby.

688
00:33:26,115 --> 00:33:29,084
Now the key to making money
in this situation like this.

689
00:33:29,084 --> 00:33:32,052
Is the position of yourself
now before the settlement.

690
00:33:32,053 --> 00:33:34,283
Because the time we read it
on the wall streetjournal.

691
00:33:34,322 --> 00:33:37,155
It's already too late.

692
00:33:37,192 --> 00:33:39,160
And you wait.

693
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,127
You wait.

694
00:33:40,161 --> 00:33:42,060
And whoever speak first.

695
00:33:42,095 --> 00:33:44,256
Loses.

696
00:33:45,132 --> 00:33:47,327
Sorry, I.. I appriciate the call..

697
00:33:47,334 --> 00:33:50,064
I really had to give this some thought.

698
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:52,037
And go talk to my wife about it.

699
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:53,095
Em, can I call you back?

700
00:33:53,105 --> 00:33:54,299
They don't know, right?
They got to think about.

701
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:57,207
They are gonna talk to his fucking
wife, to the fucking tooth fairy.

702
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:59,075
The point is doesn't matter
what the fuck they say.

703
00:33:59,111 --> 00:34:02,273
The only real objection of what
they have is they don't trust you guys.

704
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,248
Why should they trust you,
I mean, looked at you.

705
00:34:04,282 --> 00:34:07,183
You're bunch of slazy salesman, right?

706
00:34:07,219 --> 00:34:09,119
So, what do you say?

707

You.. You call phone me.
You're total stranger.

716
00:34:30,073 --> 00:34:33,041
I'm complete agree with you,
you don't know me, I don't know you.

717
00:34:33,075 --> 00:34:35,168

719
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:39,070
I'm senior vice-president in Stratton Oakmont.

720
00:34:39,114 --> 00:34:42,242
And I planned to being on of the top brookers
at my firm in the next year.

721
00:34:42,251 --> 00:34:44,218
And I not gonna get there by being
below of standard.

722
00:34:44,252 --> 00:34:48,313
I won't say that, you sound like..
You sound like sincerely guy.

723
00:34:48,356 --> 00:34:51,189
Because I'm gonna make you rich,
and it's not gonna make you poor.

724
00:34:51,192 --> 00:34:53,250
But what Stratton will do in it's serving

725
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:56,024
is bend the mark for future busines, Kevin.

726
00:34:56,062 --> 00:34:57,154
You feel comfortable with me now, Scotty?

727
00:34:57,163 --> 00:35:01,190
And then you'll know, for sure, that you

728
00:35:01,234 --> 00:35:03,098

And who can consitetly make you money.

Sound fair enough?

731

735
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:24,247
Kevin, you give me one shot here
on the blue chips stock like Kodak.

736
00:35:24,254 --> 00:35:29,282
And believe me, Kevin, the
only problem you're gonna have,

737
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:34,195
is that you didn't buy more, sounds fair enough?

738
00:35:35,131 --> 00:35:38,100
Shit, well...

739
00:35:38,134 --> 00:35:45,039
Ah... My wife might divorce me,
but yeah, let's do it. Oh, yeah.

740
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,270
Excellent choice, Kevin, how
much you wanna go for this time?

741
00:35:47,342 --> 00:35:51,244
- Let's do $5.000 dollars or something...
- We'll try $8.000, Kevin.

742
00:35:51,246 --> 00:35:54,113
- Alright, let's do $10.000. You wanna do that?

743
00:35:54,149 --> 00:35:56,241

00:36:16,234 --> 00:36:17,258
What a fucking idiot.

750
00:36:17,269 --> 00:36:22,002
The one thing I know about

756

Just say I'm wrong, and the stock goes down...

757
00:36:38,121 --> 00:36:42,251
I make you in the words of my grandfather,
God rests his soul in a shit tons of money.

758
00:36:42,292 --> 00:36:46,227

Let's get the party started!

773
00:37:42,046 --> 00:37:48,109
Scalp! Scalp! Scalp! Scalp!

774
00:37:48,117 --> 00:37:54,283
FYI boys, Danielle promised to use her $10.000
for breast implant, she already got C cups,

775
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:57,054
but now she wants fucking double D!

776
00:37:57,093 --> 00:38:00,289
Is this a great fucking comedy or what?

777
00:38:02,097 --> 00:38:06,090
This is the place to be the wild!

778
00:38:08,103 --> 00:38:13,199
Done it! Blow the roof of this motherfucker!

779
00:38:47,305 --> 00:38:50,068
Do it!

780
00:39:40,052 --> 00:39:43,145
Word about us spread through out Wallstreet.

781
00:39:43,288 --> 00:39:46,257
Even to places I didn't wanted to.

782
00:39:55,232 --> 00:40:00,260
Wasn't long before Forbes Magazine, the flagship
of Wallstreet call to do a profile on me.

783
00:40:00,304 --> 00:40:04,069
Let me ask you, how do you see
the future, for Stratton Oakmont?

784
00:40:04,107 --> 00:40:06,075
We'll work...

785
00:40:07,277 --> 00:40:10,110
- Diversification.
- Sounds good.

786
00:40:10,113 --> 00:40:12,081
Thank you so much, I have more
than enough, I appreciate your time.

787
00:40:12,115 --> 00:40:14,048
- Fantastic!
- Can we get a quick picture?

788
00:40:14,183 --> 00:40:17,209
A total fucking hatchetjob.

789
00:40:17,252 --> 00:40:20,119
This knitting little twad! Look at this!

790
00:40:20,122 --> 00:40:23,113
''The Wolf of Wallstreet,'' they call me. Look!

791
00:40:23,157 --> 00:40:25,990
- Your hair looks good. Yeah.
- My hair looks good.

792
00:40:26,027 --> 00:40:27,119
Jordan Belfort...
(pushing dicey stock)

793
00:40:27,161 --> 00:40:31,120
sounding like a kind of ''Twisted
Robin Hood,'' who takes from the rich...

794
00:40:31,165 --> 00:40:35,123
and gives to himself and his merry little
band of brokers. Read that, read it.

795
00:40:35,202 --> 00:40:40,071
Listen, there is no such thing
as bad publicity, sweet heart.

796
00:40:40,106 --> 00:40:42,301
- Big article, babe.
- Jordan, you look great.

797
00:40:43,009 --> 00:40:44,032
You're in a huge magazine.

798
00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:45,098
The fucking deal I will.

799
00:40:45,144 --> 00:40:47,112
Mr. Belfort! Just give me a chance!

800
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:50,013
Mr. Belfort! Excuse me, excuse me, Sir!

801
00:40:50,049 --> 00:40:53,041
[CROWD]

802
00:40:53,052 --> 00:40:54,211
Shut the fuck up!

803
00:40:55,053 --> 00:40:56,042
What's all this?

804
00:40:56,054 --> 00:40:58,989
It's the Forbes article, they
all want to work for you now.

805
00:40:59,023 --> 00:41:01,048
Hey! What did I say?

806
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:05,125
Hey! You want a job, you talk to me!

807
00:41:05,128 --> 00:41:08,996
- Mr. Belfort!
- Forbes make me a superstar.

808
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:15,034
Everyday, dozens of money craze
kids be the path to my door.

809
00:41:15,204 --> 00:41:18,196
If we hired them, they drop
straight outta college overnight...

810
00:41:18,241 --> 00:41:22,268
and spent whatever allowance they had
on a new suit from our Stratton taylor.

811
00:41:22,311 --> 00:41:25,040
Are you fucking serious right now?

812
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:28,208
I mean we were literally putting
clothes on these kids backs,

813
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:31,219
And here comes thisjerk off snffing around.

814
00:41:31,253 --> 00:41:35,052
But you know, everytime
someone rises up in this world,

815
00:41:35,055 --> 00:41:38,252
there's always gonna be some
asshole trying to drag him down.

816
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:44,220
Within months we doubled in size
and move into even bigger offices.

817
00:41:51,004 --> 00:41:52,232
It was a mad house.

818
00:41:52,272 --> 00:41:58,301
A greed fest, with equal parts,
cocaine, testoterone and body fluids.

819
00:41:59,077 --> 00:42:00,169
Yeah!

820
00:42:00,178 --> 00:42:06,116
It got so bad, I had to declare the office a
fuck free zone between the hours of 9 and 7.

821
00:42:06,183 --> 00:42:08,174
But I'm counting even that didn't enough.

822
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:11,250
Actually the madness started
on our very first day.

823
00:42:11,255 --> 00:42:14,247
When one of our brokers Ben
Jenner, christens the elevator,

824
00:42:14,292 --> 00:42:17,158
by getting a blowjob from a sales assistant.

825
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:21,256
Her name was Pam and her credit,
she did have this amazing technique,

826
00:42:21,264 --> 00:42:24,995
with this wild, twist and jerk motion.

827
00:42:25,035 --> 00:42:28,026
By the month later, Donnie
and I decided to double team...

828
00:42:28,037 --> 00:42:31,996
on a saturday afternoon while our wives
were out shopping for Christmas dresses..

829
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:35,143
Eventually Ben marriage,
that which was pretty amazing,

830
00:42:35,144 --> 00:42:38,977
considering she blew every
single guy in the office.

831
00:42:39,113 --> 00:42:42,139
He ain't got the present and
killed himself 3 years later.

832
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:46,246
Anyway I hired my Dad, Max to
maintain order as The Enforcer.

833
00:42:46,287 --> 00:42:49,187
Stratton very own Gestapo.

834
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:53,082
We called him ''Mad Max. '' because
of his hair trigger temper.

835
00:42:53,126 --> 00:42:57,119
Which could be set off by something as
obnoxious as a ringing telephone.

836
00:42:58,197 --> 00:43:04,033
Who the fuck has the Goddamn ball to
call this house on a tuesday night?

837
00:43:04,036 --> 00:43:06,004
Goddamn it!

838
00:43:06,038 --> 00:43:07,027
You're gonna missed it!

839
00:43:07,073 --> 00:43:09,040
Oh, please, tell me something I don't know!

840
00:43:09,074 --> 00:43:12,066
I wait all wek for The fucking Equalizer!

841
00:43:12,077 --> 00:43:14,102
And I have to fucking... Hello?

842
00:43:14,145 --> 00:43:16,045
But as soon as he picked up the phone...

843
00:43:16,081 --> 00:43:17,207
Jean? How are you Jean?

844
00:43:17,248 --> 00:43:19,215
He defect his weird British accent.

845
00:43:19,216 --> 00:43:22,982
Why, yeah, Jean, that would be great. Cherio!

846
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:24,112
It was absolutely bizarre.

847
00:43:24,154 --> 00:43:25,212
Fucking half wit!

848
00:43:25,255 --> 00:43:29,020
- And hang up and then he's Mad Max all over again
- You missed it!

849
00:43:29,058 --> 00:43:30,184
Damn!

850
00:43:30,193 --> 00:43:32,991
What, tell me what happened, what happened?

851
00:43:33,029 --> 00:43:35,020
Well, he discovered it was the Mother's sister.

852
00:43:35,064 --> 00:43:35,996
Who's he? Who?

853
00:43:36,032 --> 00:43:37,090
- Tell me who he is?
- The main guy.

854
00:43:37,133 --> 00:43:38,997
- You know who the main guy,
- The main guy...

855
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,969
it was his Mother sister, she showed up dead.

856
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:46,206
Of course, Mad Max didn't have to know
everything we were doing at Stratton.

857
00:43:46,241 --> 00:43:50,199
Then there's a big target and we...
They get lunge at the target, they stick.

858
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:52,975
There's a bulls eye and the
bulls eye a dollar sign,

859
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:55,106
whoever gets close to the dollar
sign gets the most points.

860
00:43:55,116 --> 00:43:56,981
I so full of this shit of
this little fucking thing.

861
00:43:57,017 --> 00:43:58,041
Yeah, you have to hear yourself talk.

862
00:43:58,052 --> 00:43:59,144
So, if he gets hurt, what happens?

863
00:43:59,186 --> 00:44:00,209
Yeah, we're gonna a get fucking knock.

864
00:44:00,253 --> 00:44:03,984
I don't think he's gonna get hurt, they're like...
They got like super human strenght.

865
00:44:04,023 --> 00:44:05,081
I think he's gonna be fine.

866
00:44:05,091 --> 00:44:07,059
You can't look him right in the eyes.

867
00:44:07,093 --> 00:44:08,219
You can't look him at in the eye?

868
00:44:08,261 --> 00:44:10,057
That's a fact, I saw it on PBS.

869
00:44:10,095 --> 00:44:12,120
They get confuse, their they wires get cross.

870
00:44:12,164 --> 00:44:16,066
You gotta look like, the chin Like it's looks like
I'm looking at you, but I'm looking at your chin.

871
00:44:16,068 --> 00:44:17,968
I feel like you addressing me
right now, but you're not, are you?

872
00:44:18,003 --> 00:44:21,995
They're like The Monalisa, they find eye
contact, like wherever you standing in the room,

873
00:44:22,039 --> 00:44:23,131
the minute they lock in, you know.

874
00:44:23,141 --> 00:44:25,166
No, but there is a limit to
what we could do with them.

875
00:44:25,209 --> 00:44:29,009
I mean, we're allowed to throw shit at em'.
We allowed to throw food, bananas...

876
00:44:29,046 --> 00:44:30,035
I know crack button.

877
00:44:30,081 --> 00:44:33,015
But, for example, what I wouldn't do
is maybe like tell the police cock out.

878
00:44:33,049 --> 00:44:36,018
and like to get some of the girls
to, you know... Fun or shit like that.

879
00:44:36,052 --> 00:44:37,986
- That would be... That's unacceptable.
- I mean we can, let's keep that in our pocket.

880
00:44:38,021 --> 00:44:40,114
But this guy is more about
thrown, thrown at the dartboard?

881
00:44:40,157 --> 00:44:41,180
Correct, yes, yes.

882
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:44,956
The thing is this is their gift, okay?
They're built to be thrown like a long dart.

883
00:44:44,994 --> 00:44:47,053
They're top heavy like a long
dart, so they're built for accuracy.

884
00:44:47,096 --> 00:44:49,189
Oh, My God, this is...
Can we bowl with this guy?

885
00:44:49,265 --> 00:44:51,255
That's his fucking brother, Robbie.
He brothers the bowling ball.

886
00:44:51,266 --> 00:44:55,066
The brother you put a skateboard on,
strapped him onto a skateboard.

887
00:44:55,103 --> 00:44:56,229
you toss him down on alley at some pins.

888
00:44:56,271 --> 00:44:58,000
No shit, that's intersesting.

889
00:44:58,106 --> 00:45:00,097
- Can we get that guy?
- We can get, we'll get that guy too.

890
00:45:00,141 --> 00:45:02,108
But it says here, this guy will show his cock.

891
00:45:02,142 --> 00:45:04,007
Yeah, instead of going up, yeah.

892
00:45:04,011 --> 00:45:07,003
They are very armory, by the way, so you
gotta be very careful with these little guys.

893
00:45:07,047 --> 00:45:09,015
Safety first, safety is first, alright?

894
00:45:09,049 --> 00:45:12,142
I want somebody with a fucking tranquilizer
gun, ready to knock this fucker out.

895
00:45:12,185 --> 00:45:14,244
- Do we want to get like a...
- Mace tasers gun.

896
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:16,050
A pellet gun manybe? Just like the...

897
00:45:16,122 --> 00:45:19,023
No, pellet gun, is gonna hurt him,
I just want him out, knocked out cold

898
00:45:19,025 --> 00:45:21,255
I say we stick with the loophole, right, okay?

899
00:45:21,994 --> 00:45:24,257
We don't considered him a human,
we just considered it an act.

900
00:45:24,262 --> 00:45:27,231
I think we're in the clear, like a flying,
you know a lot of those guys died.

901
00:45:27,265 --> 00:45:28,254
but they never sued anybody.

902
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,025
The important thing, you
guys gotta keep in mind is...

903
00:45:31,036 --> 00:45:34,027
is that these things gossip,
they get together and they gossip.

904
00:45:34,138 --> 00:45:36,265
- It's a good point.
- And the last thing that we need is...

905
00:45:36,974 --> 00:45:39,169
them getting together and then saying ''Oh,
listen, they made fun of us'' like...

906
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:42,111
- like, it's gonna make Stratton look bad.
- That's why I love you.

907
00:45:42,146 --> 00:45:43,112
You think of shit like that.

908
00:45:43,112 --> 00:45:44,136
That is a come in?

909
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:46,205
We treat itjust like one of us, okay?

910
00:45:46,249 --> 00:45:49,980
One of us, we're gonna treat them like one of us!

911
00:45:50,019 --> 00:45:53,112
We accept that one of us, we're
gonna treat them like one of us!

912
00:45:53,155 --> 00:45:55,123
We accept that one of us, we're
gonna treat them like one of us!

913
00:45:55,123 --> 00:45:56,147
Jordan!

914
00:45:56,191 --> 00:45:59,024
Your Dad's coming, something
about The American Express bill?

915
00:45:59,027 --> 00:46:01,120
- Hey, can you get him outta here? I'm not...
- Yeah, lick my toe.

916
00:46:01,163 --> 00:46:03,063
No, I'm serious, get...

917
00:46:03,131 --> 00:46:05,257
Fuck! Okay, guys, act like we're working on stuff.

918
00:46:06,167 --> 00:46:08,135
Okay, he's coming, he's coming.

919
00:46:08,135 --> 00:46:09,227
Make some shit off.

920
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:11,204
I think we're short at visor...

921
00:46:11,272 --> 00:46:16,208
$430.000 dollars in one month, Jordy, huh?

922
00:46:16,209 --> 00:46:22,011
Four hundred and fucking thirty thousand
fucking dollars in one fucking month!

923
00:46:22,048 --> 00:46:24,015
Good morning, they're businness expenses, relax!

924
00:46:24,016 --> 00:46:26,211
Business expenses? Jordy, look what you got here!

925
00:46:26,252 --> 00:46:27,150
- What?
- Look at this,

926
00:46:27,186 --> 00:46:31,054
$26.000 dollars for one fucking dinner!

927
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:33,024
Okay, no, no, no this could be explained.

928
00:46:33,025 --> 00:46:35,185
Dad, we had client, we have the Visa client.

929
00:46:35,226 --> 00:46:37,091
Right, the porter house from Argentina.

930
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:39,153
The expensive champagne and
wine, we have to buy champagne...

931
00:46:39,197 --> 00:46:41,995
And you go it all the fucking sides.
Tel him about the sides order.

932
00:46:42,033 --> 00:46:43,091
- I ordered the sides, so...
- Sides?

933
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:46,967
Sides? $26.000 dollars, worth the sides?

934
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:49,061
What are this sides? That cures cancer?

935
00:46:49,072 --> 00:46:52,974
This sides did cure cancer, that's the
problem, that's why they were expensive.

936
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:54,170
- Shut the fuck up!
- I'm serious...

937
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:55,108
- I know...
- Stop!

938
00:46:55,144 --> 00:46:59,171
EJ Entertainment, what the
fuck is EJ Entertainment?

939
00:46:59,181 --> 00:47:02,014
Well, that's a...

940
00:47:02,051 --> 00:47:03,985
- Jordan what's EJ entertainment?
- How I describe this...

941
00:47:04,253 --> 00:47:06,982
- It's a fucking prostitution ring, Jordy!
- I know.

942
00:47:07,022 --> 00:47:09,183
- That's what it is!
- That's... That is what it is.

943
00:47:09,224 --> 00:47:11,124
That's the perfect decription for it!

944
00:47:11,159 --> 00:47:14,026
It is what it is, but none
of this were charge to me,

945
00:47:14,062 --> 00:47:15,222
This is all of them.

946
00:47:15,263 --> 00:47:16,194
Oh, that was all of us.

947
00:47:16,196 --> 00:47:19,097
It wasn't me though, fucking
explain the shit to him!

948
00:47:19,099 --> 00:47:21,158
These all of your fucking charges right here!

949
00:47:21,201 --> 00:47:24,170
You guys, The IRS, they
allow for T&A, it's fine.

950
00:47:24,204 --> 00:47:27,229
- T&A, T&A?
- Yeah, I said T&E.

951
00:47:27,273 --> 00:47:29,173
- No, no you said T&A.
- No, I didn't.

952
00:47:29,208 --> 00:47:31,972
- Yeah you did, you say T&A!
- When did I say that?

953
00:47:32,011 --> 00:47:32,978
It's T&E, alright?

954
00:47:32,979 --> 00:47:37,108
I know you're upset about the dinner and that
make sense because we did spend too much money.

955
00:47:37,149 --> 00:47:38,116
But I said T&E...

956
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:40,118
Don't tell me what you
said, I heard what you said.

957
00:47:40,152 --> 00:47:41,084
- I...
- Dad, he said T&A.

958
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:43,144
- Yeah, he said T&A.
- Yeah, absolutely no question. I heard it.

959
00:47:43,188 --> 00:47:44,086
Jordan, I'm trying too...

960
00:47:44,089 --> 00:47:45,113
- I'm fucking sweating.
- I'm getting this close.

961
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:46,952
- Dad, relax!
- I'm getting this close!

962
00:47:46,991 --> 00:47:49,152
That's what I'm saying, why you open up more, Max?

963
00:47:49,193 --> 00:47:50,125
He's gonna fucking kill you.

964
00:47:50,161 --> 00:47:53,995
Why do you hold it in? Max, why do you hold it in?

965
00:47:53,998 --> 00:47:55,989
That's it, that's it! Get the fuck out!

966
00:47:56,033 --> 00:47:57,090
- No, no, no, no!
- Hold on!

967
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:58,124
Get out asshole!

968
00:47:58,168 --> 00:48:01,137
- What kind of hooker takes credit card?
- A rich one!

969
00:48:01,171 --> 00:48:03,935
At Stratton, there were 3 kinds of hookers,

970
00:48:04,007 --> 00:48:06,066
the blue chips, top of the line, model material.

971
00:48:06,076 --> 00:48:10,978
They cost between $300-$500 and you had to
wear a condom unless you gave them a hefty tip.

972
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:12,207
Which of course I always did.

973
00:48:12,247 --> 00:48:16,081
Then came the Nasdaq, who are pretty not great.

974
00:48:16,085 --> 00:48:18,211
They cost between $200 and $300 bucks.

975
00:48:18,252 --> 00:48:21,050
Finally there were the pink sheets skanks.

976
00:48:21,055 --> 00:48:22,989
They cost about $100 or less.

977
00:48:23,024 --> 00:48:26,084
And if you didn't wear a condom, you have
to get a pennicilin shot the next day...

978
00:48:26,127 --> 00:48:27,991
and pray your dick didn't fall off.

979
00:48:27,995 --> 00:48:29,986
Not that we didn't fuck them too.

980
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:32,123
Believe me, we did.

981
00:48:32,165 --> 00:48:34,998
Aw! I slip this thing again.

982
00:48:35,035 --> 00:48:37,128
I know what it is, you know too much...

983
00:48:37,237 --> 00:48:39,170
with EJ Entertainment.

984
00:48:39,205 --> 00:48:41,969
- Pops...
- How are things at home?

985
00:48:41,974 --> 00:48:46,035
Well, not the best, she just doesn't...
You know what I'm saying?

986
00:48:46,112 --> 00:48:51,208
It's like this smell, a smell, there's attraction
thing and after a while itjust kinda fades away.

987
00:48:51,216 --> 00:48:54,083
- Yeah, well it supposed to fade away.
- Supposed to?

988
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:55,950
- That's marriage, you know...
- That so...

989
00:48:55,987 --> 00:48:58,148
- Your Mother and I we've been
married a long long time. - I know

990
00:48:58,189 --> 00:49:01,157
What do you think? We, we, we...
jumpin' into bed every 2 minutes?

991
00:49:01,158 --> 00:49:04,184
- It doesn't work that way.
- I love her to death, I want to stay married, but

992
00:49:05,162 --> 00:49:09,120
It's crazy out there, some of these
girls. You should see them, oh my God.

993
00:49:10,166 --> 00:49:15,160
They're fucking... The things they doing
now, Pops, I mean it's on a whole new level.

994
00:49:15,204 --> 00:49:17,069
- Really?
- And they're all shaved too.

995
00:49:17,106 --> 00:49:18,073
Get outta here!

996
00:49:18,107 --> 00:49:19,937
- All shaved and nice.
- Are you kidding me?

997
00:49:19,975 --> 00:49:22,944
- Yeah, bald as a China doll.
- No bush? No bush?

998
00:49:22,978 --> 00:49:24,206
- No bush, I know...
- Oh, My God.

999
00:49:24,246 --> 00:49:26,111
All of the sudden like, one week...

1000
00:49:26,148 --> 00:49:29,049
- Nobody had anything down there anymore.
- It's a new world.

1001
00:49:29,084 --> 00:49:32,052
- They bald from the eyebrows down.
- Wow.

1002
00:49:32,086 --> 00:49:35,078
- Nothing, not a stitches, like lasers.
- Wow. New world.

1003
00:49:35,089 --> 00:49:39,025
I was born too... Too early.

1004
00:49:39,093 --> 00:49:41,083
I've never been a fan of the bush to be honest.

1005
00:49:41,127 --> 00:49:42,219
- Really?
- Yeah.

1006
00:49:42,228 --> 00:49:43,991
I don't mind it.

1007
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:47,158
Dad, I don't want you
stressin' out about any of this.

1008
00:49:47,167 --> 00:49:50,102
How can I not get stressed out? Look at
the knuckle heads you got working for you.

1009
00:49:50,136 --> 00:49:54,037
I know they're knuckle head, but I need
them to want to live like me, you get it?

1010
00:49:54,073 --> 00:49:55,938
To live like me.

1011
00:49:55,974 --> 00:50:01,001
Jordy, one of these days, the
chickens are gonna come home to roost.

1012
00:50:03,014 --> 00:50:04,208
You looking at me like I'm crazy.

1013
00:50:04,248 --> 00:50:07,945
Crazy? This is obscene.

1014
00:50:08,019 --> 00:50:14,082
It was obscene, in the normal world.
I mean who the fuck wanted to live there?

1015
00:50:14,191 --> 00:50:18,025
The party are fucking cast off!

1016
00:50:27,103 --> 00:50:35,032
We got planes up here, that's gonna take
this company into the fucking stratosphere!

1017
00:50:37,145 --> 00:50:41,047
Wolf! Wolf! Wolf!

1018
00:50:43,050 --> 00:50:44,950
Fuck Lynch, fuck them!

1019
00:50:44,985 --> 00:50:47,044
Why should they be taking all of our
fucking money all the fucking time?

1020
00:50:47,087 --> 00:50:48,145
That's why we became underrun.

1021
00:50:48,188 --> 00:50:53,215
It was our next big move, finding
companies to take public, IPO's.

1022
00:50:54,026 --> 00:50:55,186
It was the only way this Wallstreet pricks...

1023
00:50:55,228 --> 00:50:59,164
would ever stop thinking of us
as some shit kick a bucket shot.

1024
00:50:59,165 --> 00:51:00,962
We got an unclip international.

1025
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:06,062
See we're a little different, we like to get as
fucked up as possible during our businness powers.

1026
00:51:06,071 --> 00:51:08,198
in order to stimulate our free flowing ideas.

1027
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:11,971
Which is why we're popping
this ludes like they were M&M's.

1028
00:51:12,043 --> 00:51:13,202
You mad...

1029
00:51:15,146 --> 00:51:18,206
We own the fucking company...
We own the company...

1030
00:51:18,249 --> 00:51:20,240
Don't know what a ludes is?
I'll tell you.

1031
00:51:20,951 --> 00:51:22,942
Wait, wait, wait...

1032
00:51:22,987 --> 00:51:28,083
Looks like those ludes are working
their magic on Donnie, right now.

1033
00:52:00,187 --> 00:52:05,055
The Quaalude or lude as it commonly referred to,

1034
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:10,221
was first synthetize in 1951 by an
Indian doctor, that's not feathers.

1035
00:52:10,229 --> 00:52:16,064
as a sedative and was prescribed to
stressed out house wife with sleep disorders.

1036
00:52:16,201 --> 00:52:22,162
But pretty soon, someone figured out that if you
resist the urges to sleep forjust 15 minutes...

1037
00:52:22,173 --> 00:52:25,141
you got a prety kick ass high from it.

1038
00:52:25,175 --> 00:52:29,077
Didn't take long for people to
start abusing ludes of course.

1039
00:52:29,112 --> 00:52:34,072
And in 1982 The U.S Government scheduled
one of them along with the rest of the world.

1040
00:52:34,952 --> 00:52:38,045
Which meant there's only a
finite amount of this things left.

1041
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:44,218
No shit, you can't even buy them
anymore, you people all shit out of luck.

1042
00:52:44,994 --> 00:52:48,190
- Steve Madden...
- Steve Madden.

1043
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:51,125
- Steve...
- Steve.

1044
00:52:51,166 --> 00:52:52,929
You remember those ads?

1045
00:52:53,001 --> 00:52:57,027
Those giant headed girls with the bug eyes,
wearing those big clunky shoes?

1046
00:52:57,071 --> 00:53:01,007
- My friend from school, Steve Madden.
- His friend from school, Steve Madden.

1047
00:53:01,041 --> 00:53:03,942
Steve Madden was the name
in women shoes at the moment...

1048
00:53:03,944 --> 00:53:07,071
and all of Wallstreet was begging
to take his company public.

1049
00:53:07,113 --> 00:53:08,978
Go ahead, what is it?

1050
00:53:09,015 --> 00:53:11,074
- Except, guess who grew up with them?
- Women shoes!

1051
00:53:11,117 --> 00:53:12,175
Women shoes.

1052
00:53:12,185 --> 00:53:14,983
My very own Vice President.

1053
00:53:15,088 --> 00:53:16,952
Women shoes.

1054
00:53:16,989 --> 00:53:19,048
Diamond Donnie Azoff.

1055
00:53:19,091 --> 00:53:21,924
- Madden... Steve...
- Steve.

1056
00:53:22,194 --> 00:53:25,027
Jordy, Jordy, Jordy, Jordy... You
better come check this fucking chic' out.

1057
00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:26,088
Look at this, look there.

1058
00:53:32,003 --> 00:53:34,938
- That was hot.
- That girl, if she was my sister,

1059
00:53:34,972 --> 00:53:38,065
I would let that girl give me fucking 8.

1060
00:53:38,108 --> 00:53:40,167
Can the wolf handle it?

1061
00:53:42,145 --> 00:53:43,908
She's hot!

1062
00:53:44,014 --> 00:53:45,948
Christy...

1063
00:53:50,219 --> 00:53:52,983
Jordan, this is my friend, Naomi.

1064
00:53:52,988 --> 00:53:55,047
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Naomi.

1065
00:53:55,090 --> 00:53:56,216
Naomi, nice to meet you.

1066
00:53:56,926 --> 00:53:58,916
Nice to meet you, you got an awesome place here.

1067
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,087
I don't think I've ever been

00:54:15,976 --> 00:54:18,069
How many times you gonna ask
her, if she's never on a jetski?

1077
00:54:18,945 --> 00:54:21,004
I don't know, I might ask

1078
00:54:21,047 --> 00:54:22,105
Okay...

Just tell her I'll be there in couple of minutes.

1082
00:54:31,957 --> 00:54:33,049
Why don't you tell your wife that?

1083
00:54:33,058 --> 00:54:34,889
How am I gonna do that? While
I'm having a conversation...

1084
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:37,121
You know what? I think we should get going.

1085
00:54:37,128 --> 00:54:38,959
Wait, wait, where you guys going?

1086
00:54:38,997 --> 00:54:40,088

00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:42,155
- No, no, yeah stay for a drink.

1088
00:54:42,166 --> 00:54:44,999
No, no, we got to other parties
we supposed to get to, so...

1089
00:54:45,135 --> 00:54:47,000
Why don't you let her stay for a while?

1090
00:54:47,037 --> 00:54:49,096
- Let her stay for a while, what's the big deal?
- Perfect...

1091
00:54:49,139 --> 00:54:51,163
- You like champagne?
- I do.

1092
00:54:51,207 --> 00:54:53,937
Donnie, what the fuck are you doing?

1093
00:55:02,217 --> 00:55:05,084
You gonna have to excuse my friend, he gets...

1094
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:08,089
- Get the fuck outta here!
- Jordan, you gotta fuck her, she so hot!

1095
00:55:08,090 --> 00:55:15,086
Fuck you Donnie, let him finish
it Hildy, that's fucking rude.

1096
00:55:20,134 --> 00:55:22,192
So, Bay Ridge. That's near Staten Island, right?

1097
00:55:22,936 --> 00:55:25,029
Brooklyn across The Verrazano bridge.

1098
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:27,130
- Southern island territory.
- That's right.

1099
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:31,041
You mean gulge, go to Verrazano
bridge and see the plank.

1100
00:55:31,076 --> 00:55:34,011
Right, so I presumed you're Italian?

1101
00:55:34,013 --> 00:55:39,952
On my Dad side, I'm also Dutch,
German, English, I'm a mutt.

1102
00:55:40,019 --> 00:55:43,954
- You're a mutt?
- Yeah, I still have family over there, in London.

1103
00:55:44,022 --> 00:55:48,083
My Aunt Emma, she's the
best, very British you know?

1104
00:55:48,092 --> 00:55:51,027
- She's a classy lady.
- That explains it then.

1105
00:55:51,062 --> 00:55:52,028
Explains what?

1106
00:55:52,029 --> 00:55:56,989
Explains you, I mean you're Duchess, right?
The Duchess of Bay Ridge.

1107
00:56:00,070 --> 00:56:03,197
Excuse me, can I get a straw, please?

1108
00:56:04,974 --> 00:56:06,168
Thank you.

1109
00:56:09,078 --> 00:56:14,947
So, I was a little surprise
you ask Christy for my number.

1110
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:17,050
Why is that?

1111
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:21,081
Aren't you married?

1112
00:56:21,956 --> 00:56:26,187
Well, yeah, but what? Married
people can't have friends?

1113
00:56:28,128 --> 00:56:30,961
We're gonna be friends?

1114
00:56:31,065 --> 00:56:34,192
Yeah. You don't wanna be my friend?

1115
00:56:38,071 --> 00:56:41,006
We're not gonna be friends.

1116
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:51,141
And then I worked on my designs.

1117
00:56:51,183 --> 00:56:57,052
I have an entire an entire line of
lingerie, camisoles, bustiers, panties.

1118
00:56:58,055 --> 00:57:02,116
She designs woman panties too? Oh, My God!

1119
00:57:12,035 --> 00:57:15,094
Come on Jordan, think of a
way to get up to her apartment.

1120
00:57:20,109 --> 00:57:23,078
You want to come up for some tea or something?

1121
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:27,013
Tea? Yeah, like hot tea?

1122
00:57:27,048 --> 00:57:29,016
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah, sounds nice, yeah.

1123
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:31,883
Tea, fuck yeah I wanna come up for tea.

1124
00:57:31,919 --> 00:57:35,149
Like rosehips or something like that.

1125
00:57:35,188 --> 00:57:37,019
This is Rocky.

1126
00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:40,057
- Who is this? say hi, Rocky.
- Hi, sweet heart.

1127
00:57:41,027 --> 00:57:45,156
- Okay. - Why don't you light a fire or
something, I'll be right out.

1128
00:57:45,197 --> 00:57:47,961
- Yeah, fire, yeah.
- Sure.

1129
00:57:51,070 --> 00:57:53,163
I like your painting, it's uh...

1130
00:57:59,144 --> 00:58:02,910
God, help me how do I fuck this girl?

1131
00:58:06,049 --> 00:58:10,076
- Are you alright?
- Yeah, yeah I just try to light the fire in here.

1132
00:58:14,992 --> 00:58:19,018
That's it, that's it! You leave and
don't get involved, go home to your wife.

1133
00:58:28,103 --> 00:58:33,040
As you can probably guess, I
fuck her Goddamn brains out!

1134
00:58:33,108 --> 00:58:35,906
Oh, Jesus Lord!

1135
00:58:37,945 --> 00:58:39,970
For 11 seconds.

1136
00:58:50,123 --> 00:58:53,957
- Did you just cum?
- Oh, yeah I just came.

1137
00:58:54,961 --> 00:58:57,054
- Did you? Did you cum?
- No.

1138
00:58:57,096 --> 00:58:58,027
No?

1139
00:58:58,030 --> 00:59:02,057
Okay, I'm still hard, just give me a second.

1140
00:59:02,167 --> 00:59:04,931
- Sure.
- Yeah...

1141
00:59:04,970 --> 00:59:06,904

1142
00:59:07,005 --> 00:59:10,064
Hold me, oh yeah... Oh yeah...

1143
00:59:16,948 --> 00:59:20,007
- Oh, God!
- Fuck off, Rocky!

1144
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:22,041
- Do you have biscuits or something like that?
- It's okay.

1145
00:59:22,118 --> 00:59:24,018
- Just keep going.
- Rocky, go play.

1146
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:26,079
Gom play Rocky, go, go...

1147
00:59:28,958 --> 00:59:30,949
- You're crazy.
- I couldn't get enough.

1148
00:59:30,993 --> 00:59:33,894
I mean her pussy was like heroin to me.

1149
00:59:33,996 --> 00:59:37,159
And it wasn'tjust about the sex
either, Naomi and I got along.

1150
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:40,133
I mean we... We had similiar interest in shits.

1151
00:59:46,007 --> 00:59:48,134

00:59:57,084 --> 00:59:59,950

1154
01:00:05,157 --> 01:00:09,025

1155
01:00:10,195 --> 01:00:12,026

01:00:37,887 --> 01:00:39,980

01:00:40,023 --> 01:00:42,013

1163
01:00:42,057 --> 01:00:44,924
- Jesus Christ!
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

1164
01:00:44,926 --> 01:00:47,121
I thought you're at the fucking beach!
i didn't know you were here.

1165
01:00:47,162 --> 01:00:51,063
That's who you fucking been?
With that fucking whore from the party?

1166
01:00:51,098 --> 01:00:52,087
What are you doing here? I
thought you were at the beach!

1167
01:00:52,133 --> 01:00:54,067
How could you do this to me?

1168
01:00:54,068 --> 01:00:56,127
- Sweetie, come on!
- I don't know who the fuck are you Jordan.

1169
01:00:57,038 --> 01:00:59,939
You're like a completely different fucking person.

1170
01:00:59,974 --> 01:01:02,965
I made a mistake, I don't know
what to tell you, babe, I...

1171
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:05,135
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

1172
01:01:05,178 --> 01:01:08,079
Is that what you want?

1173
01:01:17,189 --> 01:01:19,987
Do you love her?

1174
01:01:24,929 --> 01:01:27,159
Answer me.

1175
01:01:47,917 --> 01:01:50,044
I felt horrible.

1176
01:01:50,152 --> 01:01:54,986
3 days later I filed for a divorce
and move Naomi into the apartment.

1177
01:01:58,993 --> 01:02:02,156
Say what you will, but the Duchess did have style.

1178
01:02:02,163 --> 01:02:05,893
She brought in an decorator,
feng shui the whole place,

1179
01:02:05,933 --> 01:02:07,958
she even hired a gay butler.

1180
01:02:07,968 --> 01:02:12,905
This guy was smart, sophisticated,
professional, I mean really, really great.

1181
01:02:12,940 --> 01:02:17,137
- Jasmine? - Yes, Sir, I try to stump
you this evening, really good.

1182
01:02:17,143 --> 01:02:18,906
Very good, great nose.

1183
01:02:18,945 --> 01:02:21,038
Except for that one time.

1184
01:02:25,951 --> 01:02:27,111
Oh, My God!

1185
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:30,888
Oh, hey...

1186
01:02:30,889 --> 01:02:32,948
Is it wednesday already?

1187
01:02:33,991 --> 01:02:37,927
What the fuck? That is fuck up!

1188
01:02:37,962 --> 01:02:40,954
He must thought we still at The
Hamptons this weekend, you know?

1189
01:02:40,998 --> 01:02:43,023
- Where are they doing it, sweet heart?
In the bed room? - They were everywhere!

1190
01:02:43,033 --> 01:02:46,092
There were 2 guys over there on
the table, there are more over here.

1191
01:02:46,136 --> 01:02:48,969
- There were 4 right here.
- Oh, God! Are you fucking serious?

1192
01:02:48,972 --> 01:02:51,031
Right there? Why didn't you tell me, sweetie?

1193
01:02:51,074 --> 01:02:52,871
Baby, that worst.

1194
01:02:54,077 --> 01:02:57,011
After they're left they checked the apartment.

1195
01:02:57,045 --> 01:03:00,071
Right, what? What is it, baby? What?

1196
01:03:00,149 --> 01:03:02,879
- Where's my money?
- I don't know where your money...

1197
01:03:02,918 --> 01:03:04,976
zWhere's my fucking money, where is it?

1198
01:03:04,986 --> 01:03:07,921
I don't know where your money is
Mr. Belfort, I didn't do anything.

1199
01:03:07,955 --> 01:03:10,150
- You don't know where my money is? - He's
lying Jordan, he's lying to his fucking teeth.

1200
01:03:10,158 --> 01:03:12,922
Let's start from the beginning!
Let's start from the beginning, right?

1201
01:03:12,994 --> 01:03:14,928
- You invited some friends over, right?
- Yes.

1202
01:03:14,962 --> 01:03:16,895
One thing led to another, things got outta hand,

1203
01:03:16,897 --> 01:03:21,857
We understand that, we do blow all the time, we
fucking degenerates us, so look at us, right?

1204
01:03:21,935 --> 01:03:25,098
My money were stolen from my
apartment, right from my socks drawer, alright?

1205
01:03:25,105 --> 01:03:27,095
Like I say, I don't know where your money is.

1206
01:03:27,139 --> 01:03:29,004
Just start from the beginning, who came over?

1207
01:03:29,074 --> 01:03:31,133
It's a normal day, I knew
you coming home the next day,

1208
01:03:31,143 --> 01:03:33,111
so everything will be fine, it will be cleaned up.

1209
01:03:33,879 --> 01:03:37,041
I got a little high at breakfast, I
got a little happy and made some eggs.

1210
01:03:37,115 --> 01:03:40,141
had a little bit ice cream, and then I
say, who do I know who likes ice cream.

1211
01:03:40,151 --> 01:03:42,915
- My friend Rudy, so I call Rudy.
- Who's Rudy?

1212
01:03:42,954 --> 01:03:44,012
- Who's Rudy?
- Yeah, who's Rudy?

1213
01:03:46,089 --> 01:03:47,886
You know who Rudy is, come on.

1214
01:03:47,925 --> 01:03:50,894
- He know who Rudy is?
- Who the fuck is Rudy?

1215
01:03:50,894 --> 01:03:52,919
- I don't know anyone named Rudy.
- You know, last month, The Lollipop club.

1216
01:03:52,963 --> 01:03:53,952
You know who Rudy was.

1217
01:03:54,898 --> 01:03:55,990
You know Rudy?

1218
01:03:56,033 --> 01:04:00,025
I don't know about, fucking know anyone...
What do you mean?

1219
01:04:00,036 --> 01:04:03,005
- So he went to The Lollipop club?
- Oh, he was at The Lollipop club for sure.

1220
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:04,939
On the stage aquintance with everybody.

1221
01:04:04,974 --> 01:04:08,101
I got fucked up, I like the dance, I don't
know... Maybe I met them, maybe i didn't.

1222
01:04:08,143 --> 01:04:09,110
I meet a lot of fucking people.

1223
01:04:10,045 --> 01:04:13,071
- $20.000 dollars was stolen from my fucking
sock drawer! - What are you saying?

1224
01:04:13,114 --> 01:04:14,979
All my girlfriends know that!

1225
01:04:15,016 --> 01:04:17,040
I don't know who Rudy is, what the fuck!

1226
01:04:17,051 --> 01:04:20,953
You little faggot friend, Rudy,
take my shit, did he? Answer me!

1227
01:04:20,988 --> 01:04:24,048
Okay, now I get it, now I get why I'm...
This is a gay thing.

1228
01:04:24,058 --> 01:04:25,923
- Oh!
- I see all of you.

1229
01:04:26,861 --> 01:04:28,054
This is because you're a fag?

1230
01:04:28,094 --> 01:04:32,895
My cousin is a fucking faggot and I go on
vacation with him and his boyfriend! I love faggot

1231
01:04:32,932 --> 01:04:33,899
You're like being charged, right?

1232
01:04:33,933 --> 01:04:35,093
I will not be stolen from, you get that?

1233
01:04:35,101 --> 01:04:37,126
I fucking like gay people, I don't like you!

1234
01:04:37,870 --> 01:04:40,100
You should hire a fucking Mexican
like I hired in my fucking house.

1235
01:04:41,974 --> 01:04:42,941
Shit!

I'm gonna drop you, you fucking!
Where is it?

1239
01:04:51,916 --> 01:04:54,976
Chester and Toby, they
went all yakuza on Nicholas.

1240
01:04:55,019 --> 01:04:56,111
You know, they got crazy.

1241
01:04:56,954 --> 01:04:57,943
I really appreciate your help.

1242
01:04:57,989 --> 01:05:00,855
I had to call the copsjust to
keep them from killing the poor guy.

1243
01:05:00,991 --> 01:05:04,085
I gave them each $2.000 bucks and
told them what Nicholas have done.

1244
01:05:04,995 --> 01:05:07,088
They naked his ass.

1245
01:05:08,031 --> 01:05:10,999
It's not like I care about the $50.000 anyway.

1246
01:05:11,033 --> 01:05:14,969
I was making that much almost everyday
through one rat hole or another.

1247
01:05:15,070 --> 01:05:18,039
A rat hole, is a friend, like Brad here.

1248
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:20,906
Who held stock in his name for me.

1249
01:05:20,942 --> 01:05:22,967
How are you doing? Goodbye...

1250
01:05:22,977 --> 01:05:27,937
I drive the price up, then he'd sells
and kick most of the profit back to...

1251
01:05:28,016 --> 01:05:30,882
you guessed it, me!

1252
01:05:32,119 --> 01:05:34,986
All cash, none of it's on the books.

1253
01:05:35,055 --> 01:05:38,024
A big no no of course in the eyes of the law.

1254
01:05:38,025 --> 01:05:41,858
Enter our new security attorney, Manny Riskin.

1255
01:05:41,928 --> 01:05:45,921
$700 bucks an hour to be the voice of doom.

1256
01:05:45,932 --> 01:05:48,093
You pissed up the SEC's leg, you
end up with your tits in the ringer.

1257
01:05:48,134 --> 01:05:51,000
Do not worry about it, I
have The SEC under control.

1258
01:05:51,937 --> 01:05:54,030
What the fuck are these imbeciles doing?

1259
01:05:54,039 --> 01:05:56,940
Hey, what are you doing? Hey!

1260
01:05:56,975 --> 01:05:58,875
We got The SEC in here!

1261
01:05:59,010 --> 01:06:03,946
The Security of Exchange Comission
sent 2 lawyers down to review our files.

1262
01:06:03,981 --> 01:06:05,972
So I set them up in our conference room.

1263
01:06:06,016 --> 01:06:11,043
And I had it bugged and the air conditioning
turn up so high that it felt like antartica there.

1264
01:06:11,087 --> 01:06:14,022
- Is it always this cold in here?
- I don't know.

1265
01:06:14,057 --> 01:06:17,083
Then, while they were looking
for a smoking gun in that room,

1266
01:06:19,128 --> 01:06:24,087
I was gonna fire off a bazooka
here, offering up our latest IPO.

1267
01:06:24,132 --> 01:06:27,101
An IPO is an initial public offering,

1268
01:06:27,135 --> 01:06:30,969
It's a first time a stock is offered
for sales to the general population.

1269
01:06:31,006 --> 01:06:34,133
Now as the firm taking the company
public, we set the initial sales price...

1270
01:06:34,875 --> 01:06:36,843
then sold those shares right back to our friends.

1271
01:06:36,877 --> 01:06:41,041
Yet... Look, You're not gonna
following what I'm saying anyway, right?

1272
01:06:41,148 --> 01:06:43,115
That's okay, that doesn't matter.

1273
01:06:43,116 --> 01:06:46,984
The real question is this, was all this legal?

1274
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:49,079
Absolutely fucking not.

1275
01:06:49,122 --> 01:06:51,988
We will making more money
than we knew what to do with.

1276
01:06:55,995 --> 01:06:59,123
And what do you do when you making
more money than you knew what to do with?

1277
01:07:04,135 --> 01:07:06,899
Oh, My God.

1278
01:07:06,938 --> 01:07:08,963
Will you marry me?

1279
01:07:09,007 --> 01:07:10,031
Oh, My God.

1280
01:07:10,074 --> 01:07:12,065
Is that a yes?

1281
01:07:12,909 --> 01:07:16,003
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

1282
01:07:16,013 --> 01:07:18,038
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1283
01:07:28,124 --> 01:07:32,026
I held my bchelor party
at The Mirage in Las Vegas.

1284
01:07:32,028 --> 01:07:34,860
They flight there alone was a buck and all.

1285
01:07:34,863 --> 01:07:38,856
One last blow out fior the God
before I settle down for good.

1286
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:43,859
A hundred staff, 50 hookers plus
50 more waiting once we landed.

1287
01:07:44,004 --> 01:07:48,941
All in drugs, I mean I tell you, up
plane was like a pharmacy with wings.

1288
01:08:18,135 --> 01:08:22,868
All told, that we came
across nearly 2 million bucks.

1289
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:27,100
Including the cost of
refurbishing the entire 28 floor.

1290
01:08:28,011 --> 01:08:30,036
Kiss the bride.

1291
01:08:31,114 --> 01:08:35,106
Ah, but the wedding was
something out of a fairy tale.

1292
01:08:35,117 --> 01:08:37,984
With Naomi, my Duchess.

1293
01:08:38,020 --> 01:08:42,889
Meet her handsome Duke in the Bahamas ocean club.

1294
01:08:53,034 --> 01:08:58,061
Of course after the bachelor party, me,
The Duke needed a few pennicilin shots,

1295
01:08:58,071 --> 01:09:02,098
so we could safely consumate the marriage.

1296
01:09:06,912 --> 01:09:08,903
I'm Barry Klineman, filming the wedding.

1297
01:09:08,948 --> 01:09:10,074
A few words, huh? For your son.

1298
01:09:10,116 --> 01:09:16,055
Jordan, remember what I told you, it
involves your penis and her vagina...

1299
01:09:16,088 --> 01:09:20,023
and you know what to do, Jordy.

1300
01:09:36,140 --> 01:09:39,108
Oh, My God! Aunt Emma?

1301

- Aunt Emma, hey, how are you doing?
- Jordan, how are you?

- Just one more step.
- Where are we going?

1312
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:31,054
Keep your eyes closed, 1, 2, 3!

1313
01:10:33,090 --> 01:10:35,957
- What is this?
- It's your wedding present.

- What?
- It's your wedding present, sweetheart.

- Are you serious?
- I'm serious.

1317

A pricy pleasure boat offer the most fun of love.

1320

It's no coincidence that it's 150 feet
of green hull is the color of passion.

1321
01:10:55,010 --> 01:10:55,999

- You like it?
- Yes!

what you're up to?

1365
01:13:09,865 --> 01:13:11,833
- You're father now, Jordan.
- Yeah.

1366
01:13:11,867 --> 01:13:15,893
You're father now, and yet you still acting
like an infant!

1367
01:13:16,037 --> 01:13:20,838
God damn it! Baby, you know, you got really
anger issues!

1368
01:13:20,842 --> 01:13:22,935
- You got so many emotional problem..
- Who was the one who threw in here..

1369
01:13:22,978 --> 01:13:25,946
At three in the morning on that stupid helicopter?

1370
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:27,845
And woke up Skylar.

1371
01:13:27,848 --> 01:13:31,011
- That was you.
- Skylar, that fucking bullshit!

1372
01:13:41,027 --> 01:13:48,023
Does it matter to you, that I just hit that
driving range, sided with bermuda grass..

1373
01:13:48,066 --> 01:13:50,933
- Oh, My God, bermuda Grass.
- You fucking ridiculous!

1374
01:13:50,936 --> 01:13:55,065
No, you didn't research the whole thing, and
you with the fucking gold course!

1375
01:13:55,106 --> 01:13:58,940
Oh my God, you had the deal with the golf
course people too!

1376
01:13:58,943 --> 01:14:01,878
What a great tragedy, honey, oh My God.

1377
01:14:01,879 --> 01:14:05,939
You probably had to pay them in cash,
with you hand, what a fucking burns!

1378
01:14:05,982 --> 01:14:10,078
And actually do some work besides swiping
my fucking credit card all day, huh?

1379
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:12,918
'Cause I can't keep tracking you profession,
honey!

1380
01:14:12,922 --> 01:14:14,913
'Cause last month you're one connoisseur..

1381
01:14:14,958 --> 01:14:18,017
And now you aspiring landscape architect,
let me get that right?

1382
01:14:18,060 --> 01:14:21,928
- Fuck you!
- No, no fucking dare throw that fucking
water at me!

1383
01:14:21,964 --> 01:14:23,932
Don't you fucking dare!

1384
01:14:24,066 --> 01:14:25,999
All right, honey?

1385
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,969
And we can just, we can talk this on, all right?

1386
01:14:29,037 --> 01:14:31,835
Just use our words, you know..

1387
01:14:31,939 --> 01:14:33,998
Communicating, okay?

1388
01:14:34,909 --> 01:14:38,036
Come one sweetheart, talk to me.

1389
01:14:38,045 --> 01:14:41,947
Stop flexing your muscle Jordan, you look
like a fucking imbecile.

1390
01:14:42,049 --> 01:14:44,813
Babe, come on, you should feel..

1391
01:14:44,851 --> 01:14:49,048
...should feel happy you gotta husband
who's in such a great shape like this, huh?

1392
01:14:49,922 --> 01:14:54,086
Come here, come on give me a kiss, you look
so beautiful right now, come on.

1393
01:14:54,827 --> 01:14:55,816
- Kiss you?
- You look so beautiful..

1394
01:14:55,828 --> 01:14:57,920
- Kiss you?
- Yeah, give me one..

1395
01:14:58,897 --> 01:15:00,023
Fuck you!

1396
01:15:00,098 --> 01:15:02,931
Ah, yes, my morning ritual.

1397
01:15:02,934 --> 01:15:06,995
First I'd get up and fight with Naomi about
whatever is I did the night before,

1398
01:15:07,038 --> 01:15:11,030
Next was a steam so I could sweat out the
drugs that still in my system..

1399
01:15:11,041 --> 01:15:12,941
Then I assess the damage.

1400
01:15:12,976 --> 01:15:17,878
Drowned out my eyeball, take my back pill
to get the day started,

1401
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:19,939
Then seek to make up with Naomi.

1402
01:15:19,949 --> 01:15:22,042
Good morning daddy.

1403
01:15:22,085 --> 01:15:24,918
Where's my kiss?

1404
01:15:25,855 --> 01:15:28,015
Hey, sweetheart..

1405
01:15:28,957 --> 01:15:32,017
Could daddy get a kiss from
both of you little girls?

1406
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:40,933
Oh no, no, daddy doesn't even get to touch
mommy, for a very very very long time

1407
01:15:40,935 --> 01:15:44,996
Daddy is really sorry about what he said
in the other room, he didn't mean any of it.

1408
01:15:45,072 --> 01:15:47,939
Daddy shouldn't waste his time.

1409
01:15:47,975 --> 01:15:56,848
And from now on, it's gonna be nothing but short,
short skirt around the house.

1410
01:15:58,017 --> 01:16:00,883
And you know something else, daddy..

1411
01:16:01,954 --> 01:16:08,860
Mommy isjust so sick
and tired wearing panties

1412
01:16:09,861 --> 01:16:11,886
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1413
01:16:13,931 --> 01:16:24,829
In fact, she is decided to throw them
all away.

1414
01:16:28,979 --> 01:16:31,037
So take a good look daddy,

1415
01:16:31,814 --> 01:16:35,045
You gonna be seeing all of this
around the house.

1416
01:16:35,985 --> 01:16:37,976
Yeah, mommy.

1417
01:16:38,854 --> 01:16:40,912
But no touching.

1418
01:16:46,861 --> 01:16:50,024
- What's wrong daddy?
- oh, baby..

1419
01:16:51,865 --> 01:16:53,025
God..

1420
01:16:54,902 --> 01:16:55,960
Look at this shit.

1421
01:16:56,003 --> 01:16:57,903
Okay, mommy likes to play game with daddy.

1422
01:17:01,874 --> 01:17:02,772
Mommy..

1423
01:17:02,808 --> 01:17:08,906
Have you ever notice anything odd about
Mr. Fuzzybear over there?

1424
01:17:10,016 --> 01:17:13,815
His eyes seems to be a little bit odd, don't they?

1425
01:17:13,952 --> 01:17:17,979
Yeah, there's something little bit different
about his eyes.

1426
01:17:18,790 --> 01:17:20,917
Yes, I think it's true,
say hi mommy!

1427
01:17:20,959 --> 01:17:23,791
Say Hi to Rocco and Rocco,
say hi.

1428
01:17:23,827 --> 01:17:25,795
Are you fellas see that, huh?

1429
01:17:25,829 --> 01:17:29,890
Of all the fucking days, she chooses today
to give me blue balls.

1430
01:17:29,967 --> 01:17:32,799
I mean today was the biggest day
in Stratton history..

1431
01:17:32,802 --> 01:17:34,895
And I needed to be thinking straight.

1432
01:17:34,971 --> 01:17:36,962
Jordan, welcome!

1433
01:17:37,073 --> 01:17:38,005
Steve here yet?

1434
01:17:38,007 --> 01:17:41,807
This was the day that we launch the Steve
Madden IPO.

1435
01:17:41,811 --> 01:17:43,801
Should be around here,
everyone are rallied, excited..

1436
01:17:43,845 --> 01:17:46,837
Everything had to run tight, and had
to be perfect.

1437
01:17:46,882 --> 01:17:48,941
What the fuck is that kid doing?

1438
01:17:49,017 --> 01:17:50,848
What is he doing?

1439
01:17:51,019 --> 01:17:55,819
The biggest IPO in the firm's history,
what the fuck is he doing?

1440
01:17:56,090 --> 01:17:58,888
Is he.. is he wearing a bowtie?

1441
01:17:58,893 --> 01:18:01,987
Hi, How are you doing?

1442
01:18:02,029 --> 01:18:03,893
Good.

1443
01:18:03,964 --> 01:18:05,932
Are you cleaning the fish bowl?

1444
01:18:07,834 --> 01:18:13,772
- I just, I had a minute and I..
- You gotta minute, and today you need to clean
the wish bowl? today?

1445
01:18:13,839 --> 01:18:17,036
I have finished my paperwork, and I was
thought that I just have couple minutes.

1446
01:18:17,076 --> 01:18:19,909
Okay, nice to meet you.

1447
01:18:25,049 --> 01:18:27,779
On the issue day!

1448
01:18:27,919 --> 01:18:30,888
You cocksucker! Why the fuck in the issue day?!

1449
01:18:30,922 --> 01:18:32,787
This is what you do?!

1450
01:18:32,824 --> 01:18:35,018
Hey, everybody, listen up!

1451

This is what happen when you fuck with
your pet on the Issue day!

1452
01:18:51,841 --> 01:18:55,936
Take your little bowtie, get your
shit, and get the fuck outta my office.
You understand?

1453
01:18:55,944 --> 01:18:57,935
Get the fuck out!

1454
01:19:01,016 --> 01:19:06,009
Everybody on port! We are here
to make money, everybody on port

1455
01:19:07,955 --> 01:19:10,924
The real wolf pit, which
is exactly how I liked it

1456
01:19:10,924 --> 01:19:13,859
Jordan, When I came to lobby I caught a genius.

1457
01:19:13,894 --> 01:19:15,861
Enter, Steve Madden.

1458
01:19:16,029 --> 01:19:18,998
Red hot ladies footwear impressario.

1459
01:19:19,032 --> 01:19:22,832
And thanks to Donnie, we were taking
this company public

1460
01:19:22,835 --> 01:19:26,793
Stratton Oakmont was crawling at the
primordial Oz.

1461
01:19:26,838 --> 01:19:28,066
Pawn Scam no more.

1462
01:19:28,073 --> 01:19:29,938
That's why they gotta see your face.

1463
01:19:29,941 --> 01:19:32,842
Get them fired up so they push the
shit outta this stack, okay?

1464
01:19:32,878 --> 01:19:37,905
Not only that, Donnie and I secretly own
85%% Steve Madden's shoes.

1465
01:19:37,948 --> 01:19:39,973
Which illegally speaking was a big no, no.

1466
01:19:39,984 --> 01:19:43,852
But we get filthy fucking rich
of our troops got behind it.

1467
01:19:43,921 --> 01:19:46,013
Ourjob was to get them worked up.

1468
01:19:46,790 --> 01:19:48,052
But not too worked up.

1469
01:19:49,826 --> 01:19:55,787
Hello, for those who don't know me, I uhhh,

1470
01:19:55,799 --> 01:19:58,961

1471
01:19:58,967 --> 01:20:00,935
The shoe, show them the shoe,

1472
01:20:00,936 --> 01:20:04,804
Okay, yeah, anyway, you know,

1473
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:06,807
This pretty cool, this is the Mary Lou

1474
01:20:06,808 --> 01:20:09,868
Which is really the shoe who put me on the map,
without her, I wouldn't be here.

1475
01:20:09,911 --> 01:20:11,936
- It's a fat girl shoe.
- Believe it or not..

1476
01:20:11,979 --> 01:20:16,938
Believe it or not, though, Mary Loui is actually
the same as the Mary Jane but it's black Leather.

1477
01:20:22,889 --> 01:20:25,915

You're having good afternoon or what?

1482
01:20:42,073 --> 01:20:48,841
I want to take a moment to tell you why Steve
here is so absolutely off the fucking wall.

1483
01:20:48,979 --> 01:20:52,972
Is because this man is a creative genius.

1484
01:20:53,050 --> 01:20:56,884
This ability, this gift that Steve has..

1485
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:59,979
.. goes beyond just, spotting the hottest shoe
trends.

1486
01:21:00,790 --> 01:21:04,055
Steve's power is that he creates trends.

1487
01:21:04,060 --> 01:21:05,857
You understand?

1488

1491
01:21:15,771 --> 01:21:17,966
I don't think you're all realized.

1492
01:21:18,039 --> 01:21:28,778
That Steve Madden is the hottest person in the
winning shoe industry with orders going through
the roof of every departmen store in North America

1493
01:21:28,848 --> 01:21:31,009
We have him here at our office!

1494
01:21:31,851 --> 01:21:34,820
We should thank our fucking lucky
star, this man is here.

1495
01:21:34,821 --> 01:21:39,951
We should be on our hands in knees right

1496
01:21:40,058 --> 01:21:44,017
Like this! Ok? I want to suck

Everyone is going to suck you off.

1498
01:21:46,932 --> 01:21:51,800
This is our golden ticket into the
fucking chocolate factory right here.

1499
01:21:51,836 --> 01:21:55,772
And I want to meet Louis Vodka Wonka,

1500
01:21:55,807 --> 01:21:59,004
And I want to meet with the fucking
Oompa Loompa like this!

1501
01:22:02,813 --> 01:22:04,974
All right, get off this fucking stage,
get out of here.

1502
01:22:05,849 --> 01:22:08,784
All right, I want you to focus
for a second.

1503
01:22:08,785 --> 01:22:10,809
See those little black boxes?

1504
01:22:10,853 --> 01:22:14,789
They call it telephone, I'm gonna let you in on
a little secret about this telephone.

1505
01:22:14,857 --> 01:22:17,758
It not gonna dial themselves, okay?

1506
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:21,855
Without you, they just worthless
hungs of plastics.

1507
01:22:21,896 --> 01:22:26,026
Like a loaded M-16 without a trained marine
to pull the trigger.

1508
01:22:26,768 --> 01:22:28,895
And in the case of the Telephone,

1509
01:22:28,937 --> 01:22:32,872
It's up to each and every one of you..

1510
01:22:32,973 --> 01:22:42,040
My hightly trained Strattonites,
my killers who will not take no for an answer.

1511
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:44,812
My fucking warriors.

1512
01:22:44,817 --> 01:22:46,808
Who'll not hang up the phone.

1513
01:22:46,853 --> 01:22:53,781
until their client either buys or
fucking die!

1514
01:23:06,904 --> 01:23:08,769
Let me tell you something.

1515
01:23:08,806 --> 01:23:11,934
There is no nobility in poverty.

1516
01:23:11,942 --> 01:23:17,937
I've been a rich man, and I've been a poor man,
and I choose to rich every fucking time!

1517
01:23:18,848 --> 01:23:23,784
'Coz at least as a rich man, when I have to face
my problems, I show up in the back of the limo..

1518
01:23:23,785 --> 01:23:28,916
Wearing $ 2000 suite, and $ 14000
gold fucking watch.

1519
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:33,920
Good boys, get him up! Hit him!

1520
01:23:33,961 --> 01:23:36,020
Fuck off from me!

1521
01:23:36,030 --> 01:23:40,797
If there anyone here thinks I am superficial
of materialistic..

1522
01:23:40,835 --> 01:23:45,828
Go get a job in fucking McDonalds, 'cause
that's where you fucking belong!

1523
01:23:46,907 --> 01:23:50,934
But before you depart this room
full of winners..

1524
01:23:51,044 --> 01:23:54,911
I want you to take a good look at the
person next you, go on.

1525
01:23:55,781 --> 01:23:57,976
'Cause sometime in not so distant future..

1526
01:23:57,983 --> 01:24:04,945
You know, you pulled out to a red light and
you beat-up old fucking Pinto, and that person
gonna be pulling up right along side you..

1527
01:24:04,989 --> 01:24:07,924
In the brand new Porsche.

1528
01:24:07,926 --> 01:24:12,989
With their beautiful wife by their side,
who's got big full up juiced tits.

1529
01:24:13,865 --> 01:24:15,957
And who will you be next to?

1530
01:24:15,966 --> 01:24:23,839
Some disgusting wildebeast with 3 days of razor
stubble in a sleeveless moo-moo, crammed in the
next you with a carload of groceries from the

1531
01:24:23,874 --> 01:24:24,999
.. fucking price club!

1532
01:24:25,007 --> 01:24:27,805
And that's who you're gonna be sitting next to!

1533
01:24:27,843 --> 01:24:29,936
So you listen to me and you
listen well.

1534
01:24:29,946 --> 01:24:32,779
Are you behind on you credit card bills?

1535
01:24:32,848 --> 01:24:35,008
Good, pick up the
phone and start dialing!

1536
01:24:35,016 --> 01:24:37,917
Is the landlord ready to evict you? Good!

1537
01:24:37,953 --> 01:24:40,751
Pick up the phone, and start dialling!

1538
01:24:40,755 --> 01:24:44,748
Is your girlfriend think you're fucking
worthless loser? Good!

1539
01:24:44,759 --> 01:24:46,885
Pick up the phone and
start dialling!

1540
01:24:46,894 --> 01:24:51,024
I want you to deal with your problems
by becoming rich!

1541
01:24:52,032 --> 01:24:54,728
All you have to do today!

1542
01:24:54,768 --> 01:24:56,894
Is pick up the phone.

1543

And speak the words that I have taught you.

1544
01:24:59,973 --> 01:25:06,844
And I will make you richer than the most
powerfull CEO in the United States.

1545
01:25:09,748 --> 01:25:11,807
I want you to go out there..

1546
01:25:12,017 --> 01:25:17,852
And I want you to ram Steve Madden's stock down
to your clients throats..

1547
01:25:17,888 --> 01:25:20,823
Till they fucking chokes on it.

1548
01:25:20,825 --> 01:25:25,888
Till they choke on it and the buy a hundred
thousands shares, that's what I want to do!

1549
01:25:25,997 --> 01:25:27,987

Now let's start this motherfucker
rolling around!

1553
01:25:40,743 --> 01:25:42,870
[ MUSIC ]

1554
01:26:08,901 --> 01:26:13,861
At one PM, we opened the stock for sale
at 4 dollar and 15 cent a share

1555
01:26:13,873 --> 01:26:16,899
By 01:03, it was over $18.

1556
01:26:16,942 --> 01:26:19,876
Even the big wallstreet firms were buying.

1557
01:26:28,919 --> 01:26:33,947
From the 2 million shares offered for sale, a
million belong to me held in phony accounts by my
ratholes.

1558
01:26:33,991 --> 01:26:36,858
Now, once the price hit the high teens..

1559
01:26:36,994 --> 01:26:40,827
You know what? Who gives this
shit? As always, the point is this.

1560
01:26:40,830 --> 01:26:45,927
$ 22.000.000 in 3 fucking hours!

1561
01:26:45,968 --> 01:26:48,800

1562
01:26:48,837 --> 01:26:49,861
I get love this-

1563
01:26:49,871 --> 01:26:50,838
Crazy account!

1564
01:26:50,872 --> 01:26:54,740
Call for you! Berry Kleinman
on the phone from Future Video?

1565
01:26:54,776 --> 01:26:57,870
- Who?
- I don't know, he shoot your wedding,
he said it's urgent.

1566
01:26:57,913 --> 01:26:59,903
Urgent? Who the fuck is Berry Kleinman?

1567
01:26:59,914 --> 01:27:02,712
Oh my God, you want to marry me?
You're in love with me?

1568
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:03,910
Yeah, go fuck your cousin.

1569
01:27:03,951 --> 01:27:04,883
Berry, what's up?

1570
01:27:04,919 --> 01:27:08,946
- Listen, uh, I got this Subpoena..
- Subpoena? What are you talking about?

1571
01:27:08,956 --> 01:27:10,980
The FBI, they want to copy of your
wedding video.

1572
01:27:11,024 --> 01:27:13,891
Fucking FBI? Are you fucking kidding me?

1573
01:27:13,927 --> 01:27:17,920
Listen to me, his name is Denham, he is an
agent within the New York Office.

1574
01:27:17,931 --> 01:27:19,921
What is his problem? He's a boyscout!

1575
01:27:19,965 --> 01:27:22,729
Thinks you're fucking Gordon Gecko!

1576
01:27:22,968 --> 01:27:25,937
What does he want from my wedding video?
It's like invasion to my privacy.

1577
01:27:25,938 --> 01:27:28,839
You know what I am saying? It's like..
It's intrusive!, you know..

1578
01:27:28,874 --> 01:27:31,808
He's got picture of your whole inner
fucking circle

1579
01:27:31,843 --> 01:27:35,006
Pictures, name of the people, he is do what
is he wants to do, exactly what is he do.

1580
01:27:35,046 --> 01:27:38,812
Look at your self, he's try to rattle you,
he's try to rattle your old lady..

1581
01:27:38,816 --> 01:27:41,716
So she nagging you to turns become
a fucking witness.

1582
01:27:41,752 --> 01:27:44,846
Oh, so he wants me to rat on my self, he wants
me to give information about my..

1583
01:27:44,888 --> 01:27:48,756
- What your solution?
- The good fucking news, is I know everybody
down town.

1584
01:27:48,792 --> 01:27:54,730
I called the justice department, the DEA, nobody
even know you fucking exist. So calm down!

1585
01:27:54,730 --> 01:27:56,925
- They don't know I exist?
- No.

1586
01:27:56,932 --> 01:27:58,866
That's Good.

1587
01:28:02,804 --> 01:28:06,706
- But you.. you know who is he, right?
- Yeah.

1588
01:28:06,741 --> 01:28:12,872
So if I just want to get some more information,
just find out what he know, you can.. you can go
his house, go to his house

1589
01:28:12,946 --> 01:28:15,972
right, tap his phone, a little bit bug him..
you could get some information

1590
01:28:16,016 --> 01:28:18,951
You don't fuck with these guys like this.

1591
01:28:18,952 --> 01:28:21,749
You don't fuck with him like that, what do
nuts or something?

1592
01:28:21,788 --> 01:28:23,016
What do you fucking do? What did I pay you for?

1593
01:28:23,022 --> 01:28:25,786
I have a fucking PI license, you know?

1594
01:28:25,792 --> 01:28:27,851
I am making living at this, I am not
a cop anymore.

1595
01:28:27,860 --> 01:28:30,761
- They'll take my fucking license away from me,
all right? - Okay.

1596
01:28:31,798 --> 01:28:35,893
Okay, if I can't do that, can I just
can I get the guy a call?

1597
01:28:36,768 --> 01:28:38,827
- Why? Is that..
- Jordan, Jordan..

1598
01:28:38,870 --> 01:28:42,771
Do me a favor, the only one who
call this guy is your lawyer.

1599
01:28:42,807 --> 01:28:43,899
- Allright, okay..
- What would you do?

1600
01:28:43,908 --> 01:28:50,006
I told you, whatever the fuck you say to him, he's
gonna use against you, don't you understand?!

1601
01:28:50,014 --> 01:28:52,005
He is smart, you dumb

1602
01:28:53,750 --> 01:28:56,776
- I am not allowing call-
- Are we fucking talking tonite or you gonna

1603
01:28:56,786 --> 01:29:00,950
The last time you took this fucking pills, you
put your head and fucking like a maniac, now
pick it up!

1604
01:29:01,024 --> 01:29:02,854
All right.

1605
01:29:02,858 --> 01:29:04,792
Okay, I won't call him.

1606
01:29:07,029 --> 01:29:11,762
Hey fellas, come on board, plank's
around there.

1607
01:29:11,934 --> 01:29:13,798
Welcome.

1608
01:29:13,801 --> 01:29:15,860
Huh, what a nice day.

1609
01:29:17,805 --> 01:29:20,933
Hey, welcome aboard

1610
01:29:20,975 --> 01:29:23,875
Jordan, welcome to the Naomi,
nice to meet you.

1611
01:29:23,877 --> 01:29:26,812
- Agent Denham, this is agent Hughes.
- Hi, how are you?

1612
01:29:26,813 --> 01:29:27,780
Now, I'll introduce you..

1613
01:29:27,814 --> 01:29:29,941
This Nicole, Heidi, come on,
don't be shy..

1614
01:29:29,950 --> 01:29:32,748
Why do you guys shy for?
Don't be scared..

1615
01:29:32,752 --> 01:29:33,843
These are friends of Stratton.

1616
01:29:33,886 --> 01:29:35,945
- It's a pleasure.
- Hello.

1617
01:29:37,723 --> 01:29:39,850
- Come on..
- Your message said that..

1618
01:29:39,892 --> 01:29:41,826
You want to speak privately.

1619
01:29:41,827 --> 01:29:43,727
Right, I do want to speak privately.

1620
01:29:43,729 --> 01:29:44,820
Give us some minute, hey ladies?

1621
01:29:44,863 --> 01:29:47,855
- Let me know if I can get you anything.
- We'd be happy to help.

1622
01:29:48,766 --> 01:29:54,795
You guys hungry? Want some to eat? We got some
pasta, shrimp, lobster. I got whiskey and kind
of Booze..

1623
01:29:54,872 --> 01:29:57,932
You know what, the biro doesn't allow us
to drink while at sea.

1624
01:29:57,941 --> 01:30:00,000
Duh, I forgot, of course.

1625
01:30:00,010 --> 01:30:01,978
Ever been on one of these before?

1626
01:30:02,746 --> 01:30:03,872
A boat?

1627
01:30:04,715 --> 01:30:05,840
Learned to sail when I was six

1628
01:30:05,848 --> 01:30:07,907
No shit? Is that right? All right.

1629
01:30:07,950 --> 01:30:09,884
I mean, one like this.

1630
01:30:09,919 --> 01:30:12,854
The whole front extended so it fit
the chopter up there.

1631
01:30:12,855 --> 01:30:14,789
You see that?

1632
01:30:15,724 --> 01:30:16,782
Any way, this is for you.

1633
01:30:16,825 --> 01:30:19,988
It's uh, a complete list of every person
who was at my wedding..

1634
01:30:19,995 --> 01:30:25,762
Yeah, I understand you want the whole wedding
video, figured this would help the whole process,
right?

1635
01:30:25,766 --> 01:30:27,700
- There you go.
- Look..

1636
01:30:27,735 --> 01:30:30,704
My point is that I know you're investigating
Stratton..

1637
01:30:30,738 --> 01:30:33,969
But for the life of me,
I can't figure it out why

1638
01:30:33,974 --> 01:30:39,843
I know we are little unorthodox, we are little
loud in the way we do things, we gotta understand
with the new guys on the block..

1639
01:30:39,879 --> 01:30:42,712
You know, trying to make an impression, but..

1640
01:30:42,815 --> 01:30:45,716
Now I want you to understand, we don't..

1641
01:30:45,718 --> 01:30:48,914
do anything Illegal, whatsoever.

1642
01:30:48,954 --> 01:30:53,789
You could talk to the SEC, there were at my
office 15 times for the last 6 month..

1643
01:30:53,825 --> 01:30:56,691
I mean I got nothing to hide.

1644
01:30:56,727 --> 01:31:00,891
Well, you know the SEC is civil right regulatory
agency, we pursue criminal activity.

1645
01:31:00,932 --> 01:31:04,732
Exactly, you go after real criminals..

1646
01:31:04,735 --> 01:31:08,932
Makes me wonder what.. what the hell are you
doing sticking me for?

1647
01:31:08,939 --> 01:31:12,807
What is the thing that we did? or do?
I don't get it.

1648
01:31:12,842 --> 01:31:16,835
Well, I.. Jordan I can't discuss
ongoing investigations.

1649
01:31:16,846 --> 01:31:18,779
No, I get that, No I understand.

1650
01:31:18,781 --> 01:31:22,808
With that said, this case got dumped on
my desk.

1651
01:31:22,818 --> 01:31:24,843
- Did it?
- You know, by higher up who..

1652
01:31:24,887 --> 01:31:27,855
needs to make a show looking in and the
new company on the block..

1653
01:31:27,889 --> 01:31:29,789
- Loud guy..
- I got pressing and anything..

1654
01:31:29,791 --> 01:31:32,885
And then I ended up be in the
smuch who does the local, exactly.

1655
01:31:32,927 --> 01:31:35,896
Itjust, you know, bothers me..
We are the new guy..

1656
01:31:35,897 --> 01:31:37,864
Where the one with bank there
in Wallstreet?

1657
01:31:37,864 --> 01:31:42,801
Oh man, you should see what's going on the
bigger firms, I mean I know all the information.

1658
01:31:42,836 --> 01:31:47,773
It's true, Goldman, Lehmann Brothers, Merryl,
collateralized debt obligation..

1659
01:31:47,808 --> 01:31:50,901
Internet stock bullshit? I mean, it's a fucking
travesty.

1660
01:31:50,910 --> 01:31:55,938
I mean I can take you step by step, to what
exactly is occuring, you know..

1661
01:31:55,948 --> 01:31:58,939
All you have to do is ask.

1662
01:31:58,984 --> 01:32:00,815
It's exactly what I want to hear.

1663
01:32:00,819 --> 01:32:05,950
- Hmm.
- I don't see why a little sitdown like this, can
be profitable for the both.

1664
01:32:05,991 --> 01:32:09,721
- It should, right, it should profitable.
- It should.

1665
01:32:09,727 --> 01:32:15,859
Look, I am gonna give my personal line, 5
days a week, you just call me, feel free.

1666
01:32:15,933 --> 01:32:18,901
- I'll do that.
- Great.

1667
01:32:21,871 --> 01:32:25,705
Are you sure you guys don't want some to
drink? I mean, you're not hungry? Nothing?

1668
01:32:25,775 --> 01:32:26,764
- Nothing?
- Oh no.

1669
01:32:26,776 --> 01:32:28,835
No.

1670
01:32:30,746 --> 01:32:34,978
Mind if I ask you, and if you dont want to get
too personal, just tell me to shut up at anytime.

1671
01:32:35,951 --> 01:32:38,818
Did you try to get your broker's license
at one time?

1672
01:32:38,854 --> 01:32:41,981
Isn't that right? When you trying to take
a step at wallstreet?

1673
01:32:42,723 --> 01:32:43,985
- No?
- Who have been told it to you?

1674
01:32:44,725 --> 01:32:46,716
- Who the fuck you've been talking to?
- Why you investigating me..

1675
01:32:46,727 --> 01:32:49,787
Hei, you see what I mean?

1676
01:32:50,797 --> 01:32:54,790
You ever think about what would happen
if you're, you know, stay in the course.

1677
01:32:55,902 --> 01:33:00,929
You know what? When I ridin' home on the subway,
and my balls are fucking sweating, I'm wearing the
same suit 3 days in a row,

1678
01:33:00,973 --> 01:33:04,807
Yeah, you bet I do, I've thought about it before.
Who wouldn't rite?

1679
01:33:04,843 --> 01:33:05,810
Yeah, who fucking wouldn't?

1680
01:33:05,811 --> 01:33:08,746
I mean, what do you.. another personal question,
no need to answer if you don't like..

1681
01:33:08,781 --> 01:33:09,805
No, that's all right, Jordan.

1682
01:33:09,815 --> 01:33:12,840
Whattaya pull in? 50? 60'k?
something like that?

1683
01:33:12,884 --> 01:33:14,875
A year? Low part?

1684
01:33:16,788 --> 01:33:18,688
Let's put it this way.

1685
01:33:18,756 --> 01:33:21,747
You get a free hand gun when you
sign up for the biro.

1686
01:33:21,892 --> 01:33:23,860
No, but it is fucking pisses me off, you know.

1687
01:33:23,894 --> 01:33:27,887
When you think about the people that build
this country, hardworking people like you..

1688
01:33:27,931 --> 01:33:30,764
You know, fire fighters, teachers,
FBI agent..

1689
01:33:30,801 --> 01:33:35,931
End of the day you guys get fucking skin-the-life
financially, fucking makes me angry.

1690
01:33:36,005 --> 01:33:39,907
That's the one thing about Wall street, in this
market is, for me..

1691
01:33:39,909 --> 01:33:44,743
I feel it's good to give back, you know,

1692
01:33:44,779 --> 01:33:46,838
There's situation where I can..

1693
01:33:46,881 --> 01:33:50,681
make those situations better for people.

1694
01:33:50,785 --> 01:33:51,876
You know what I mean.

1695
01:33:51,885 --> 01:33:54,820
Opportunity is everything.

1696
01:33:54,855 --> 01:33:56,686
Exactly.

1697
01:33:56,723 --> 01:33:58,918
Take for example I got this one
kid, right?

1698
01:33:59,860 --> 01:34:02,794
He went to school for environmental
science something like that..

1699
01:34:02,829 --> 01:34:07,766
He was bogged down by students loan,
turns out, his mother needed triple bypass surgery

1700
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:09,768
- Right, horrible situation.
- Sure.

1701
01:34:09,802 --> 01:34:14,829
We got them minute, the market, the right time,
choose the right stock, we gave him the right
guidance..

1702
01:34:14,840 --> 01:34:17,707
Bom, overnight, change his entire life..

1703
01:34:17,742 --> 01:34:20,870
You know, He gotta put his mother into
the best hospital in New York City.

1704
01:34:21,780 --> 01:34:24,873
It didn't work out for her, she passed
away unfortunately, but..

1705
01:34:24,882 --> 01:34:27,874
We gave him that opportunity,
you know what I am saying?

1706
01:34:27,985 --> 01:34:32,945
Itjust about sending up the right team and
then overnight your life can change.

1707
01:34:37,994 --> 01:34:44,728
What if.. what is.. what is the intern to make
a deal like that?

1708
01:34:44,733 --> 01:34:45,961
Oh that's the situation.

1709
01:34:46,001 --> 01:34:49,937
I mean, that particular trade,
and one trade.

1710
01:34:50,772 --> 01:34:53,740
North of half a million dollar.

1711
01:34:56,811 --> 01:35:01,839
And I do that for anybody, you know, anybody
that needs the proper guidance.

1712
01:35:21,734 --> 01:35:25,863
Can you say that again? Just the
way you said it.

1713
01:35:25,904 --> 01:35:27,872
Just the same way.

1714
01:35:31,876 --> 01:35:33,673
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- No..

1715
01:35:33,711 --> 01:35:34,871
- Oh come on, you know what I am talking about.
- No, I don't know..

1716
01:35:34,879 --> 01:35:37,676
Say this, I think Jordan just did..

1717
01:35:37,714 --> 01:35:38,772
- If I am not mistake
- No.

1718
01:35:38,782 --> 01:35:41,876
- You just tried to bribe a federal agent.
- Oh, technically I didn't.

1719
01:35:41,919 --> 01:35:44,820
I didn't bribe anybody, technically, I didn't.

1720
01:35:44,821 --> 01:35:50,759
No, according to US criminal code, there needs to
be exact dollar to give for the exchange services.

1721
01:35:50,793 --> 01:35:53,853
that would not hold up on the court of law..

1722
01:35:53,863 --> 01:35:55,921
No, no, no, that's the truth, but..

1723
01:35:55,931 --> 01:35:57,796
- I want to tell you this.
- Yeah.

1724
01:35:57,832 --> 01:36:03,771
The same gentlemen that told me that you try to
get your brokers license also told me that you're
straight arrow.

1725
01:36:03,772 --> 01:36:06,740
- You ran a security check on me?
- Well..

1726
01:36:07,708 --> 01:36:11,872
Sail on the boat, fit for Bond villain,
sometimes you need to play the part, right?

1727
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:16,679
I think it's time you both get the fuck
off my boat, what do you say?

1728
01:36:17,717 --> 01:36:18,741
You know Jordan, I'll tell you something.

1729
01:36:18,751 --> 01:36:21,879
- Most of the wallstreetjackasses that I bust..
- Yeah.

1730
01:36:21,921 --> 01:36:24,754
They're.. they were the man for born.

1731
01:36:24,791 --> 01:36:25,849
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

1732
01:36:25,858 --> 01:36:29,884
Their father is douchebag, just like the
fathers before them

1733
01:36:30,696 --> 01:36:31,890
But you..

1734
01:36:32,931 --> 01:36:36,923
- You got this all way on your own.
- Did I?

1735
01:36:36,934 --> 01:36:39,767
- Good for you, little man.
- Little man?

1736
01:36:39,804 --> 01:36:41,863
- Good for you.
- Me, the little man?

1737
01:36:41,872 --> 01:36:43,772
Let me tell you something.

1738
01:36:43,774 --> 01:36:45,742
No, let me tell you something else.

1739
01:36:45,776 --> 01:36:49,677
Honestly, I am not bullshit here, this is one of
the nicest boat I've ever been on,

1740
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:50,805
- I got tell you this.
- I bet it is.

1741
01:36:50,814 --> 01:36:52,782
And you know what I just thinking too?

1742
01:36:52,782 --> 01:36:55,751
what a fucking hero that I am gonna
back at the office..

1743
01:36:55,819 --> 01:37:01,757
When the bureau seizes this fucking boat,
because I am being fucked this, fuck, fuck..

1744
01:37:01,824 --> 01:37:04,952
It's beautiful, and you got the beautiful
girls there.

1745
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:08,725
- It's wonderful.
- Okay, get the fuck off my boat.

1746
01:37:08,796 --> 01:37:10,821
I am sure we'll be seeing each other
real soon.

1747
01:37:10,832 --> 01:37:14,859
I am sure, good luck on that subway ride home,
and your miserable ugly fucking wife

1748
01:37:14,869 --> 01:37:17,929
I am gonna have Heidi lick some caviar off
my balls in the mean time..

1749
01:37:17,939 --> 01:37:20,839
Hey, you guys want to take some lobsters
for your ride home.

1750
01:37:20,874 --> 01:37:25,811
Fucking miserable bricks, I know you can't
afford 'em, fucking cheap fuck.

1751
01:37:25,846 --> 01:37:27,905
Fuck those people.

1752
01:37:27,948 --> 01:37:31,747
Hey fellas, look what I found in my pocket!

1753
01:37:31,784 --> 01:37:33,718
Your salary, right here!

1754
01:37:33,719 --> 01:37:36,654
You know what I call 'em?
Fun coupon.

1755
01:37:36,689 --> 01:37:37,781
See that?

1756
01:37:37,790 --> 01:37:39,882
The fun coupon.

1757
01:37:47,799 --> 01:37:50,733
What's hon? What the fuck is in switzerland?

1758
01:37:50,768 --> 01:37:52,759
Swiss fucking bank, that's what.

1759
01:37:52,770 --> 01:37:55,796
He was ask couple of time.
I had to hide my money.

1760
01:37:56,807 --> 01:37:57,933
Enter Rugrat.

1761
01:37:57,941 --> 01:38:00,773
He knew this Swiss Banker from law school.

1762
01:38:00,810 --> 01:38:05,907
But he was in Geneva, and there's no way I was
gonna make that flight sober.

1763
01:38:06,749 --> 01:38:08,717
So I knew if I took my drugs right

1764
01:38:08,751 --> 01:38:10,809
I could sleep to the entire flight.

1765
01:38:10,852 --> 01:38:13,787
But I had to take them just right.

1766
01:38:13,789 --> 01:38:20,853
At 4 PM I pooped a few more ludes,
which is start kicking in by the time I
finished my sales meeting. My dingle face.

1767
01:38:20,861 --> 01:38:25,821
By dinner, I popped a few more, on top
of some coctail and valium too.

1768
01:38:25,866 --> 01:38:27,925
My slur phase

1769
01:38:29,704 --> 01:38:31,864
By eight thirty, I took a few more ludes..

1770
01:38:31,905 --> 01:38:34,738
I am pretty much lost all my motor skill.

1771
01:38:34,874 --> 01:38:36,933
This was the drool face.

1772
01:38:39,713 --> 01:38:42,875
And by ten, I didn't know who or what
the fuck I was.

1773
01:38:42,881 --> 01:38:44,940
The Amnesia phase.

1774
01:38:45,684 --> 01:38:47,743
And boarded to the plane just before
midnight.

1775
01:38:47,786 --> 01:38:50,778
- Ah look at you, you're so beautiful.
- Excuse me..

1776
01:38:51,689 --> 01:38:53,782
It's his sleeping pills, he's all right,
he's all right.

1777
01:38:53,791 --> 01:38:56,851
- May I ask your boarding pass, sir?
- We have the boarding pass.

1778
01:38:56,961 --> 01:38:59,794
Jesus Christ, I am so sleepy.

1779
01:38:59,797 --> 01:39:01,787
Hey, relax!

1780
01:39:01,798 --> 01:39:04,665
Oh my God, you got your hand
on my fucking cock!

1781
01:39:04,701 --> 01:39:07,727
Get in chair, this guy is touching
my dick again.

1782
01:39:07,738 --> 01:39:09,797
- You got his hand on his dick?
- You gotta stop doing that..

1783
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:11,704
...in public space.

1784
01:39:11,741 --> 01:39:12,867
Take it off.

1785
01:39:12,875 --> 01:39:13,933
Take it off.

1786
01:39:13,976 --> 01:39:16,843
I heard there's treasure map under this..

1787
01:39:17,880 --> 01:39:19,711
- Excuse me sir.
- I know miss.

1788
01:39:19,749 --> 01:39:20,909
Please sit down..

1789
01:39:20,916 --> 01:39:22,746
- Watch him.
- Go back to your seat please.

1790
01:39:22,784 --> 01:39:24,911
- What are you upset about?
- Please go back to your seat.

1791
01:39:25,653 --> 01:39:26,779
I had been have to call the taxing.

1792
01:39:26,821 --> 01:39:29,756
Please sir, please, sit down.

1793
01:39:29,791 --> 01:39:32,657
- Please,Sit down!
- Okay, okay, I am going!

1794
01:39:32,693 --> 01:39:34,888
- Stop!
- We apologize, we are going to sleep ma'am.

1795
01:39:34,895 --> 01:39:35,919
We're sleeping as you question.

1796
01:39:35,963 --> 01:39:37,760
Fasten your seatbelt, sir.

1797
01:39:37,765 --> 01:39:40,734
- okay.
- We cannot take off if you haven't
fasten your seatbelt.

1798
01:39:40,768 --> 01:39:43,736
Sit down, fasten it, I can do it for you.

1799
01:39:43,736 --> 01:39:44,703
- What?
- I will do it for you.

1800
01:39:44,704 --> 01:39:45,864
- Okay.
- You gotta speak english..

1801
01:39:45,938 --> 01:39:47,838
We don't understand this languages, mam..

1802
01:39:47,874 --> 01:39:49,671
I will help him fasten his seatbelt..

1803
01:39:49,675 --> 01:39:50,903
I am not a fucking idiot.

1804
01:39:50,943 --> 01:39:52,876
Sit back, sit back!

1805
01:39:52,878 --> 01:39:55,711
There you go, yeah there you go!

1806
01:39:57,916 --> 01:40:02,751
- Hilfa!
- Hilfa!

1807
01:40:13,930 --> 01:40:16,922
Jesus christ, fuck.

1808
01:40:18,802 --> 01:40:23,796
Donnie, this isn't funny, you
must untie me, buddy.

1809
01:40:23,806 --> 01:40:25,797
I can't untie you.

1810
01:40:25,808 --> 01:40:28,800
The captain tied you up, he almost
fucking teasing you.

1811
01:40:29,745 --> 01:40:32,680
- Why?
- Why?

1812
01:40:45,792 --> 01:40:47,783
You were screaming at the people.

1813
01:40:49,696 --> 01:40:52,665
You are on the floor, like rolling
around and shit.

1814
01:40:52,699 --> 01:40:56,725
- You called the captain the ''N'' word.
- I called the captain the ''N'' word?

1815
01:40:56,769 --> 01:40:58,896
- Yeah, he was very upset.
- Really?

1816
01:40:58,904 --> 01:41:01,805
- Luckyly we're in the first class.
- Oh jesus.

1817
01:41:01,907 --> 01:41:05,774
Jesus christ, I think you have a fucking
drug problem!

1818
01:41:05,877 --> 01:41:11,747
- Where the ludes?
- There're at my ass, don't worry about it.

1819
01:41:11,783 --> 01:41:12,875
I got it.

1820
01:41:12,884 --> 01:41:14,852
Thank god.

1821
01:41:14,886 --> 01:41:18,787
Jesus Christ, what we gonna do when we
get to Switzerland buddy? This is bad.

1822
01:41:18,822 --> 01:41:22,758
I think this belt are get on my chest,
I can't breathe, come on do something to calm me
down, please?

1823
01:41:22,759 --> 01:41:24,784
Okay, Shut the fuck off, shut the fuck off.

1824
01:41:24,795 --> 01:41:26,921
- Oh please?
- Okay, sshh

1825
01:41:27,864 --> 01:41:29,855
That's good.
Go to sleep.

1826
01:41:29,899 --> 01:41:32,732
- Harder buddy.
- You're all right.

1827
01:41:32,768 --> 01:41:34,929
We're all love you..
Shut the fuck off!

1828
01:41:40,775 --> 01:41:44,734
Mr. Belfort, you're free go.

1829
01:41:45,814 --> 01:41:48,714
Really?

1830
01:41:50,918 --> 01:41:51,885
- Hi, Donnie.
- Yeah?

1831
01:41:51,886 --> 01:41:55,913
When we get up there, try not to act like
yourself, okay, let's make you even ass hole
version Donnie, all right?

1832
01:41:55,956 --> 01:41:57,889
- Why phone and call me to come for?
- Hey listen.

1833
01:41:57,891 --> 01:42:00,758
The only reason you sitting in this limo and not
a Swiss dale 'cause you're my friend,

1834
01:42:00,760 --> 01:42:02,694
- Ok?
- Hilfa!

1835
01:42:02,896 --> 01:42:05,865
- We're here, here, we're here.
- I am more calm down, come on.

1836
01:42:05,865 --> 01:42:08,799
Jordan Belfort, at last..

1837
01:42:08,834 --> 01:42:11,735
Nicholas has told me so much about you.

1838
01:42:11,737 --> 01:42:14,831
- Jordan, Jean Jacques Saurel.
- Pleasure to make your acquiantes.

1839
01:42:14,873 --> 01:42:16,738
Nice to meet you.

1840
01:42:17,875 --> 01:42:19,638
You understand what we're talking?

1841
01:42:19,677 --> 01:42:20,871
Oh, ok.

1842
01:42:20,878 --> 01:42:23,813
- Couch, for desk.
- I don't understand, I am sorry.

1843
01:42:23,848 --> 01:42:27,681
I am curious about your
bank secrecy laws here.

1844
01:42:29,686 --> 01:42:31,847
Wait, yes, excuse me Jordan.

1845
01:42:32,689 --> 01:42:36,921
- Swiss custom, we require 10 minutes of bla bla.
- Chit chat.

1846
01:42:36,927 --> 01:42:39,895
Chit chat thank you, before business
can be discussed.

1847
01:42:41,664 --> 01:42:42,824
Yeah.

1848
01:42:44,900 --> 01:42:48,665
Of course, let's get down to it.

1849
01:42:48,703 --> 01:42:50,671
What would you like to know?

1850
01:42:50,672 --> 01:42:55,803
Under what circumstances would you be obligated
to cooperate with the FBI or..

1851
01:42:55,843 --> 01:42:59,744
US justice department investigations,
for example?

1852
01:42:59,746 --> 01:43:01,646
Ca depend.

1853
01:43:01,682 --> 01:43:03,809
- Ca depend?
- Yeah.

1854
01:43:04,751 --> 01:43:07,777
Ca depend on what exactly?

1855
01:43:07,888 --> 01:43:11,880
Whether America plans to invade
Switzerland in upcoming month.

1856
01:43:12,658 --> 01:43:15,752
- So you want check the tank are rolling down
the Ru de La Croix? - Yes, Ru de La Croix

1857
01:43:15,795 --> 01:43:16,887
- Ah, Croix!
- Yeah, Croix

1858
01:43:16,929 --> 01:43:19,863
Not Croix, not even Ru de La Croix, Croix

1859
01:43:19,864 --> 01:43:23,630
This is what we used to do back in law school,
Champagne - Champagna.

1860
01:43:23,668 --> 01:43:26,933
- Yeah.
- yeah yeah, french fries or Frittes.

1861
01:43:27,639 --> 01:43:28,697
And kind uh..

1862
01:43:28,740 --> 01:43:30,866
- That kind of stuff.
- That's right.

1863
01:43:31,642 --> 01:43:33,803
What I'm asking you, Swiss dick,

1864
01:43:33,844 --> 01:43:36,779
is are you going to fuck me over?

1865
01:43:38,849 --> 01:43:42,909
I understand perfectly,
you American shit.

1866
01:43:44,821 --> 01:43:49,690
The only way the Banque Real de
Geneve would cooperate with a
foreign legal body

1867
01:43:49,726 --> 01:43:53,786
is if the crime being pursued
is also a crime in Switzerland.

1868
01:43:53,795 --> 01:43:58,858
But there are very few Swiss laws
which applied to your ''practises''

1869
01:43:58,900 --> 01:44:00,867
from a financial standpoint.

1870
01:44:00,868 --> 01:44:04,634
You are now in heaven.

1871
01:44:04,672 --> 01:44:06,765
See, I told you he was fantastic, right?

1872
01:44:06,874 --> 01:44:10,674
If the US Justice Department
sent us as subpoena,

1873
01:44:10,678 --> 01:44:13,771
it will become a,
um.. papier-toillette.

1874
01:44:14,748 --> 01:44:17,683
- We will wipe our ass with it.
- [LAUGHING]

1875
01:44:17,684 --> 01:44:21,619
Unless, of course, it was an
investigation into stock fraud

1876
01:44:21,654 --> 01:44:24,646
which is a crime here in
Switzerland, if I'm correct.

1877
01:44:24,657 --> 01:44:29,685
Then there would have to be co-operation,
on your part, if I'm not mistaken.

1878
01:44:29,728 --> 01:44:32,662
Yes. Yes, we would

1879
01:44:32,897 --> 01:44:35,889
Assuming the account is under your name.

1880
01:44:36,868 --> 01:44:40,736
If it were another name

1881
01:44:40,838 --> 01:44:43,806
- of friends, I get my..
- Cousin.

1882
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:45,831
Cousin, absolutely no.

1883
01:44:48,779 --> 01:44:50,838
- Relative.
- Yeah.

1884
01:44:52,782 --> 01:44:55,649
Was that yodeling I just heard or..

1885
01:44:55,651 --> 01:44:57,812
Did you just say what
I thought he said?

1886
01:44:57,853 --> 01:45:00,686
Yes. Yes.

1887
01:45:00,690 --> 01:45:02,884
He's telling me to use a fucking
rathole.

1888
01:45:02,891 --> 01:45:06,884
But the US rathole would never get
into Switzerland with all that money.

1889
01:45:06,928 --> 01:45:11,763
What I needed was a rathole with a
European passport.

1890
01:45:11,800 --> 01:45:14,700
[MUSIC]

1891
01:45:18,639 --> 01:45:20,834
- Jordan.
- Hey.

1892
01:45:20,841 --> 01:45:24,674
- How's my favourite aunt?
- Welcome, was the traffic terrible?

1893
01:45:24,711 --> 01:45:26,736
Oh, no, not at all.

Jordan, Come on in

1895
01:45:30,650 --> 01:45:33,641
Thank God, aunt Emma didn't
need too much convincing.

1896
01:45:33,685 --> 01:45:35,846
Turned out the British weren't
too different from the Swiss.

1897
01:45:35,887 --> 01:45:38,856
Money talks and bullshit takes the bus.

1898
01:45:38,857 --> 01:45:41,621
How do you say ''rathole'' in British?

1899
01:45:41,660 --> 01:45:43,820
.. If you gettin' any trouble whatsoever,

1900
01:45:43,828 --> 01:45:46,729
I'll come for it immediately,
I'll say that I duped you.

1901
01:45:46,764 --> 01:45:48,732
And I promise.

1902
01:45:48,766 --> 01:45:51,701
Risk is what keeps us
young, isn't it darling?

1903
01:45:55,705 --> 01:45:57,764
Sometimes I wonder,

1904
01:45:57,807 --> 01:46:00,799
if you let money get
the best of you, my love,

1905

It's chilly darling,
you're sweating bullets.

01:46:15,790 --> 01:46:17,781
What can I say, I'm um..

1910
01:46:18,726 --> 01:46:20,660
I'm a drug addict.

whatever it is, I'll fuckin' do it.

01:46:27,901 --> 01:46:29,732
That's the truth.

1915
01:46:29,770 --> 01:46:32,864
I am.. I am sex addict too.

1916
01:46:33,673 --> 01:46:36,766
Well there are worse things to be
addicted to than sex. [LAUGHING]

1917
01:46:36,909 --> 01:46:40,743
Jesus, why am I telling you all this?
I am sorry.

1918
01:46:41,814 --> 01:46:44,715
Because I'm very easy to talk to

You are. You are easy to talk to.

That's about it, it's..

It'sjust my job, you know, it's uh..

1922
01:46:52,690 --> 01:46:57,592
All these people depending on me, tens of
millions of dollars at stake, you know, it's..

1923
01:46:57,628 --> 01:47:02,656
Sometimes I feel like I've bitten
off more than I can chew, you know?

You're a man with large appetites.

yeah.

It is hard, though..

01:47:21,850 --> 01:47:26,719
Hard to learn to control the
anxiety, sometimes, you know?

1932
01:47:26,721 --> 01:47:28,654
You know, to..

To release the tension.

She is hittin' on me. [LAUGHING]

all just need to learn.

Learn to do what comes
naturally in life, you know?

Is he fucking hitting on me?

So I thought to myself, who
else has European passport?

1951
01:48:37,886 --> 01:48:40,649
Okay Brad, you're making
this too fuckin' tight.

1952
01:48:40,687 --> 01:48:42,882
Now, Brad, as a successful drug dealer,

1953
01:48:43,624 --> 01:48:45,717
spent his winters in the south of France,

1954
01:48:45,759 --> 01:48:47,750
which is where he met his wife, Chantelle.

1955
01:48:47,761 --> 01:48:50,729
A striper of Slovenian origin,

1956
01:48:50,763 --> 01:48:54,597
born in, of all places, Switzerland.

1957
01:48:58,704 --> 01:49:00,694
Well, this is fucked.

1958
01:49:00,705 --> 01:49:02,673
Oh, no, shit!

1959
01:49:05,877 --> 01:49:09,813
- Like this will take a, like, 50 trips.
- I know.

1960
01:49:13,684 --> 01:49:14,742
Yeah, a suicide work.

1961
01:49:14,818 --> 01:49:17,685
But, how about her family? Right?

1962
01:49:17,721 --> 01:49:19,848
I mean, they all got
Swiss's passport, right?

1963
01:49:19,857 --> 01:49:21,790
I mean, she's got parents,
she's got a brother.

1964
01:49:21,824 --> 01:49:24,588
Right, brother's got a wife,
that's five fuckin' people.

1965
01:49:24,627 --> 01:49:26,595
Six, seven trips, boom, right?

1966
01:49:26,629 --> 01:49:28,824
They're all fuckin' Swiss and it was like,
''what are you doing?'', they could do that.

1967
01:49:28,865 --> 01:49:31,697
At least I have a family,
you crooked nose fuck!

1968
01:49:31,733 --> 01:49:34,793
Hey, hey, uh, don't
forget about my money.

1969
01:49:36,638 --> 01:49:38,663
- I'm sorry, what was that?
- Hey, I forgot to tell you

1970
01:49:38,674 --> 01:49:41,665
- he's got some, he's got some money.
- My money.

1971
01:49:41,709 --> 01:49:43,768
- Yeah, a couple mill comin' in like a week.
- Yeah.

1972
01:49:43,811 --> 01:49:45,870
And when it gets here, I'll give
you a call, you come pick it up.

1973
01:49:48,883 --> 01:49:50,680
You give me a call?

1974
01:49:51,851 --> 01:49:55,651
When it gets here, I'll give you
a call, and you come pick it up.

1975
01:49:55,689 --> 01:49:57,589
Well, we don't fuckin'
work for you, man!

1976
01:49:57,624 --> 01:49:57,885
Shh..

1977
01:49:57,891 --> 01:50:00,758
Sweetheart, you have my
money taped to your tits.

1978
01:50:00,794 --> 01:50:02,761
Okay? Technically you do work for me.

1979
01:50:05,798 --> 01:50:07,595
Hey, Jordan, we're gonna need to talk.

1980
01:50:07,633 --> 01:50:09,828
If I fuckin' do this, I'm telling
you right now, I ain't goin' to him.

1981
01:50:09,868 --> 01:50:12,768
Okay? I'm not a fuckin' schwas, I
don't do fuckin' pick-ups, alright?

1982
01:50:12,804 --> 01:50:14,669
- But listen to me, when this thing placed,
- I'm gonna take care of everything.

1983
01:50:14,706 --> 01:50:16,731
and I fuckin' say, and you
tell that fuckin' piece of shit.

1984
01:50:16,774 --> 01:50:17,832
- If he comes correct.
- I will.

1985
01:50:17,875 --> 01:50:22,641
If he comes in, I'll fuckin' loopy and fucked up.
I swear to God, I'm a mash that douchebag's teeth.

1986
01:50:22,679 --> 01:50:24,647
I hear that, who's fucking cheating?

1987
01:50:24,681 --> 01:50:26,581
- Who's fuckin' cheating?!
- Look, may I asking..

1988
01:50:26,616 --> 01:50:28,743
I put the money on that
fuckin' table, not you!

1989
01:50:28,785 --> 01:50:30,719
I'm the reason we
have this fuckin' deal!

1990
01:50:30,721 --> 01:50:32,654
- I have a gun, you fucking idiot!
- What the fuck this gun.

1991
01:50:32,688 --> 01:50:33,746
I already told you this.

1992
01:50:33,789 --> 01:50:37,691
You know what? You're a fuckin' pill
deal, I got five more just like you, bro!

1993
01:50:37,727 --> 01:50:39,627
Keep talking, you piece of shit!

01:50:39,628 --> 01:50:41,721
Do you know what? You dress like shit!

1997
01:50:46,634 --> 01:50:47,692

1998
01:50:47,736 --> 01:50:48,703
Hey pal!

1999
01:50:50,805 --> 01:50:53,739
The next day, aunt Emma flew to Geneve.

2000
01:50:53,774 --> 01:50:56,607
Two million in cash in her carry on.

2001
01:50:56,643 --> 01:50:59,612
Which in a big picture was
a drop in the Swiss bucket.

2002
01:51:00,647 --> 01:51:03,706
'Cause the following month,
over the course of six roundtrips,

01:51:03,750 --> 01:51:08,778
Chantelle's family and friends smugglin'
over 20 millon in cash without even a hiccup.

One fuckin' day, one fuckin' day

2018
01:52:03,671 --> 01:52:05,695
I was fucked up, Brad.

People who don't sucker punch
people when they're scared, okay?

2029
01:52:34,599 --> 01:52:35,623
- I'm scared?
- And by the way,

2030
01:52:35,667 --> 01:52:37,759
- I haven't got an apology for that.
- One apology, okay.

2031

01:54:57,595 --> 01:54:58,823
You fuckin' kiddin' me? Lemons?

2095
01:54:58,862 --> 01:55:01,830
- [LAUGHING]
- They're gonna knock us out off our fuckin' head.

2096
01:55:01,864 --> 01:55:06,824
When it comes to quaalude, the
lemon 714 was the holygrail.

2097
01:55:06,836 --> 01:55:08,633
- Can you believe it?
- Oh my God..

2098
01:55:08,671 --> 01:55:09,638
I thought they were like a myth.

2099
01:55:09,672 --> 01:55:12,572
Three times as powerful as
anything available today.

2100
01:55:12,574 --> 01:55:15,771
- Look at these babies.
- Boy Donnie really knew how to celebrate.

2101
01:55:15,811 --> 01:55:20,680
He said he was saving these for a special
occasion, like a birthday, or being clapfree.

2102
01:55:20,716 --> 01:55:22,683
Or, my money arriving
safely in Switzerland.

2103
01:55:22,717 --> 01:55:23,809
We're gonna die!

2104

[PUKE]

2105
01:55:26,854 --> 01:55:29,618
So that night, I cleared my schedule,

2106
01:55:29,624 --> 01:55:33,650
and I rid my body of anything
that could fuck with my high.

2107
01:55:33,693 --> 01:55:35,752
It was celebration time.

2108
01:55:35,795 --> 01:55:37,558
Okay.

2109
01:55:37,597 --> 01:55:38,723
We start off with one, see how it'll go?

2110
01:55:38,732 --> 01:55:40,700
My guy says all we need is one.

2111
01:55:40,700 --> 01:55:41,632
Here we go.

2112
01:55:42,768 --> 01:55:44,633
- Salute.
- Cheers.

2113
01:55:44,670 --> 01:55:47,605
Maybe if I pull it
again, it will go down.

2114
01:55:48,841 --> 01:55:51,537
Steve,Steve! I gotta get outta here.

2115
01:55:51,577 --> 01:55:53,635
No! I think I got it figured out.

2116
01:55:53,678 --> 01:55:57,614
It must be one pull for
up, and two pull for down.

2117
01:55:57,649 --> 01:55:58,673
Okay.

2118
01:56:06,823 --> 01:56:08,620
You feel anything?

2119
01:56:11,695 --> 01:56:13,559
No.

2120
01:56:15,631 --> 01:56:17,565
Been thirty five minutes.

2121
01:56:19,769 --> 01:56:23,568
Maybe we built up a tolerance
after all these years, huh?

2122
01:56:24,873 --> 01:56:26,636
Hm..

2123
01:56:36,650 --> 01:56:37,708
This is bullshit!

2124
01:56:37,751 --> 01:56:40,811
My metabolism is pumped
out, I can't feel shit!

2125
01:56:40,854 --> 01:56:43,687
They're old, I think
they lost the potency?

2126
01:56:43,691 --> 01:56:44,657
Huh?

2127
01:56:44,724 --> 01:56:45,748
Check the bottle!

2128
01:56:49,562 --> 01:56:50,688
January '81

2129
01:56:50,730 --> 01:56:51,754
They're fuckin' duds.

2130
01:56:51,764 --> 01:56:53,789
- Fuck!
- Let's take a..

2131
01:56:53,833 --> 01:56:55,800
- Take two more each.
- Yeah.

2132
01:56:57,703 --> 01:56:59,603
Jordan!

2133
01:56:59,604 --> 01:57:00,662
You're up, babe?

2134
01:57:03,742 --> 01:57:05,606
What are you two retards doing?

2135
01:57:05,643 --> 01:57:06,701
We're workin' out, honey.

2136
01:57:07,645 --> 01:57:09,545
Well, Bo Dietl's on the phone.

2137
01:57:09,580 --> 01:57:11,707
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay?

2138
01:57:13,651 --> 01:57:14,640
Hey! Bo, what's going on?

2139
01:57:14,685 --> 01:57:16,549
Jordan, listen to me clearly.

2140
01:57:16,586 --> 01:57:18,713
I can not talk to you in this
phone, and I have to talk with you.

2141
01:57:18,722 --> 01:57:20,553
We're gonna get outta
here. What's going on?

2142
01:57:20,590 --> 01:57:23,718
Listen to me, leave the
fuckin' house, Jordan!

2143
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:27,627
And then call me from a payphone.
This is not a fuckin' joke, Jordan.

2144
01:57:27,663 --> 01:57:28,755
Yeah, yeah. Ya.

2145
01:57:29,765 --> 01:57:31,630
- Shit!
- What's.. What he said?

2146
01:57:31,667 --> 01:57:33,567
I don't know what the fuck
is going on, I gotta go!

2147
01:57:33,602 --> 01:57:34,660
Is everything okay, Jordan?

2148
01:57:44,812 --> 01:57:49,714
The closest payphone I can get to
is at the Brookvile Contry Club.

2149
01:57:49,750 --> 01:57:51,718
It was a real WASP stronghold.

2150
01:57:51,752 --> 01:57:54,550
Just a mile down the road from my house.

2151
01:58:04,563 --> 01:58:06,689
Hey Bo, what's up? It's me, what's going
on? I'm at the payphone, what's going on?

2152
01:58:06,698 --> 01:58:07,665
Listen to me carefully.

2153
01:58:07,732 --> 01:58:10,633
Please, your little friend
here, Brad, your little buddy,

2154
01:58:10,635 --> 01:58:11,693
he's in jail.

2155
01:58:11,736 --> 01:58:13,795
He.. What the fuck he's in
jail for? What did he do?

2156
01:58:13,805 --> 01:58:14,794
I don't know what he did.

2157
01:58:14,839 --> 01:58:18,740
My friend in Long Island told me he got
picked up in some fuckin' shopping mall,

2158
01:58:18,776 --> 01:58:21,802
- he got locked up..
- Wait, did you say a shopping mall?

2159
01:58:22,546 --> 01:58:23,638
- Yeah, yeah.
- He, he was with Donnie

2160
01:58:23,680 --> 01:58:26,649
he was supposed to deliver some money,
and that fuckin' fat piece of shit.

2161
01:58:26,683 --> 01:58:28,582
- I'm gonna go and fuckin' kill him.
- Jordan, Jordan, Jordan. Listen to me!

2162
01:58:28,584 --> 01:58:29,710
Don't go! Listen to me.

2163
01:58:29,752 --> 01:58:32,619
That guy, Denham, that FBI agent guy,

2164
01:58:32,622 --> 01:58:36,581
somebody told me, he's got your phone
tapped. Your ofice and your home.

2165
01:58:36,626 --> 01:58:39,685
- Don't talk on that motherfuckin' phone!
- Okay. Fuck! I got it, I got it.

2166
01:58:39,761 --> 01:58:40,728
I got it, I got it.

Jordan.

2168
01:58:42,631 --> 01:58:45,794
You didn't try to bribe this
fuckin' FBI agent, did you?

2169
01:58:45,834 --> 01:58:48,597
No, I didn't try to
bribe that FBI agent.

2170
01:58:48,602 --> 01:58:49,728
You think I'm that fuckin'stupid? No!

2171
01:58:49,770 --> 01:58:51,738
What the fuck you said?
I can't understand.

2172
01:58:51,772 --> 01:58:52,796
Say that again!

2173
01:58:52,807 --> 01:58:56,607
I said I won't, I know what
my feeling with this FBI agent.

2174
01:58:56,644 --> 01:58:57,804
What the fuck are you saying?

2175
01:58:59,679 --> 01:59:01,670
- I said..
- Are you fuckin' high?

2176
01:59:01,681 --> 01:59:04,548
Are you kidding me? I
don't wanna see more FBI!

2177
01:59:04,584 --> 01:59:06,745
Jordan! Are you fuckin' high?

2178
01:59:07,687 --> 01:59:09,745
Jordan, do me a favour.
Stay where you are,

2179
01:59:09,788 --> 01:59:11,653
don't get behind the wheel of the car,

2180
01:59:11,657 --> 01:59:12,817
I'll be there in a
moment to pick you up.

2181
01:59:13,559 --> 01:59:13,820
Jordan, Jordan!

2182
01:59:14,560 --> 01:59:16,687
After 15 years in storage,

2183
01:59:16,695 --> 01:59:20,528
the lemons had developed a delayed fuse.

2184
01:59:20,598 --> 01:59:23,829
It took 90 minutes for this little
fuckers to kick in, but once they did..

2185
01:59:24,569 --> 01:59:25,661
Pow!

2186
01:59:25,670 --> 01:59:28,798
I mean, I'd skipped the tingle phase
and went straight to the drool phase.

2187
01:59:28,840 --> 01:59:30,704
Tell me where you are, don't fuckin'..

2188
01:59:30,707 --> 01:59:35,576
This little bastard was so strong,
I discovered a whole new phase.

2189
01:59:35,612 --> 01:59:37,773
The cerebral palsy phase.

be ten thousand Swiss bankers in Geneva.

2705
02:30:37,391 --> 02:30:41,327
and Rugrat is the one dumb enough
to get himself arrested on U.S. soil.

2706
02:30:41,395 --> 02:30:42,555

2707
02:30:42,563 --> 02:30:44,622

Even more fucked was he got busted for
shit that had nothing to do with me.

2710
02:30:52,438 --> 02:30:57,465
Something about laundering drug money, to
offshore boat racing to a guy name Rocky aoki.

02:30:57,476 --> 02:30:59,535
You know the founder of Benihana.

Beni 'fucking' hana,why, why god.

2715
02:31:07,553 --> 02:31:14,424
Why would You be so cruel as to choose a chain
of fucking Hibachi Restaurants to take me down?

2716
02:31:15,459 --> 02:31:21,397
Long story, short Saurel ratted me out, but
not before he ratted out Brad's wife Chantalle.

2717
02:31:21,431 --> 02:31:25,492

2726
02:32:06,505 --> 02:32:08,598

2727
02:32:08,641 --> 02:32:11,541

2741
02:32:54,615 --> 02:32:56,606
Irresponsble prick.

2742
02:32:57,351 --> 02:32:59,319
I'll tell you one thing.

2743
02:33:00,388 --> 02:33:03,515
That you never eat Benihana again.

2744
02:33:03,523 --> 02:33:06,424
I don't care who's birthday it is.

2745
02:33:07,360 --> 02:33:09,419
What is that Naomi actually doing?

2746
02:33:09,496 --> 02:33:12,521
She right in the house there, say
hi she probably won't wave you back.

2747
02:33:12,598 --> 02:33:15,396
Naomi, sweetheart.

2748
02:33:18,437 --> 02:33:20,337
What's up her ass, was she mad at me?

2749
02:33:20,372 --> 02:33:21,396
No you know.

2750
02:33:21,407 --> 02:33:24,466
Probably had to mortgage
the house to make bail.

2751
02:33:24,509 --> 02:33:28,411
Probably ended sell a thing in
order pay for all my lawyers.

2752
02:33:28,413 --> 02:33:31,382
It's been a night mare

02:33:40,357 --> 02:33:41,346
Jordan.

2757
02:33:41,625 --> 02:33:44,457

2762
02:34:02,410 --> 02:34:05,469

2763
02:34:08,382 --> 02:34:11,351
- I'll kiss you.
- Alright, enough, enough.

2764
02:34:12,519 --> 02:34:15,351
- You wanna beer, pal?
- What do you drink?

2765
02:34:15,388 --> 02:34:17,413
We got this non-alcoholic shit.

2766
02:34:17,457 --> 02:34:19,584
- What is that?
- It's non alcoholic beer.

2767
02:34:19,625 --> 02:34:21,559
It's got no alchohol.

2768
02:34:21,594 --> 02:34:24,426
- Is it beer?
- Ya, with no alchohol.

2769
02:34:24,463 --> 02:34:28,331
But you drink enough and you
drink a lot to get you fucked up.

2770
02:34:28,367 --> 02:34:30,426
No, it's no alchoholic fucking point.

2771
02:34:30,435 --> 02:34:33,461
I'm not a scientist, i dont get fuck target
but I can get you a beer, if you want..

2772
02:34:33,505 --> 02:34:36,405
I know, but i don't drink, you remember.

2773
02:34:36,440 --> 02:34:38,465
- I'm not drink anymore.
- Are you wanna go inside.

2774
02:34:38,509 --> 02:34:41,478
And blow some lime and baking powder..

2775
02:34:41,612 --> 02:34:44,478
Can't imagine ever not
enjoyed geting fucked up.

2776
02:34:44,514 --> 02:34:46,345
- Yeah.
- I loved it.

2777
02:34:46,349 --> 02:34:47,509
But i've been sobber.

2778
02:34:47,550 --> 02:34:48,539
Fucking sucks.

2779
02:34:48,585 --> 02:34:50,485
- Boring right.
- So boring.

2780
02:34:50,520 --> 02:34:52,488
Like kill myself.

2781
02:34:52,522 --> 02:34:56,582
There is a term and we dont like to
use it unless circumtances dictate..

2782
02:34:56,625 --> 02:35:01,619
.. I think they do dictate in this case and
term is Grenada, have you ever heard Grenada.

2783
02:35:01,630 --> 02:35:02,528
No i haven't.

2784
02:35:02,564 --> 02:35:12,461
Grenada very interesting because it is a small
island nation that was invaded by the United
States of America 1983 have 9000 people.

2785
02:35:12,507 --> 02:35:15,475
And essentially means is.

2786
02:35:15,475 --> 02:35:18,501
This case is unloseable.

2787
02:35:18,545 --> 02:35:23,482
So, you know, come in we can have our dick
hanging out of our pants, nobody gives a fuck.

2788
02:35:23,517 --> 02:35:25,417
I'm gonna win.

2789
02:35:25,452 --> 02:35:27,419
You Sir.

2790
02:35:28,354 --> 02:35:30,322
Are was known.

2791
02:35:30,556 --> 02:35:32,547
As a Grenada.

2792
02:35:35,428 --> 02:35:38,521
You're looking at real prison time.

2793
02:35:38,563 --> 02:35:42,329
Money laundering can get you as much 20 years.

2794
02:35:42,367 --> 02:35:46,496
And, our case gonna be stronger, if we
caught your shed and cash your mattress,.

2795
02:35:46,537 --> 02:35:48,368
Oh that right.

2796
02:35:48,472 --> 02:35:50,372
Hei Jordan.

2797
02:35:50,407 --> 02:35:55,504
Jordan, You're rotting away in
jail, 2 your kids get out the college.

2798
02:35:55,512 --> 02:35:58,378
That's not our ambition here.

2799
02:35:58,548 --> 02:36:01,346
There's other people involve in this too.

2800
02:36:01,417 --> 02:36:04,580
We think, they need to see
their day in courts as well.

2801
02:36:06,622 --> 02:36:09,317
Why do I sense there's
an offer in the air?

2802
02:36:09,357 --> 02:36:10,483
He's got good sense.

2803
02:36:10,525 --> 02:36:12,459
What are you, Craskin?

2804
02:36:12,627 --> 02:36:21,398
Full cooperation, he provides us with the
comprehensive list of all coconspirators spanning
the last seven years and he agrees to wear a wire.

2805
02:36:21,602 --> 02:36:24,503
- Did you just say wear a wire?
- A wire.

2806
02:36:24,605 --> 02:36:27,471
Wow, wow, is that means, you
want me to rat, is that it?

2807
02:36:27,507 --> 02:36:29,338
No, i want you to cooperate.

2808
02:36:29,375 --> 02:36:31,468
- No, you want me to rat.
- Yes, we want you to rat.

2809
02:36:31,511 --> 02:36:35,572
That fucking exactly what
we want you to do, to rat.

2810
02:36:39,518 --> 02:36:41,315
How is Christy's party?

2811
02:36:41,453 --> 02:36:44,422
- Fine.
- Good.

2812
02:36:45,357 --> 02:36:47,450
Babe, i've spoke to the lawyers again today.

2813
02:36:47,526 --> 02:36:51,461
There is some really really great news.

2814
02:36:52,330 --> 02:36:55,527
Turns out you completely
off the hook, honey.

2815
02:36:55,566 --> 02:36:57,431
I know that already.

2816
02:36:57,468 --> 02:37:02,598
Right, exactly, you never did
anything wrong in first place right?

2817
02:37:03,373 --> 02:37:09,538
It turns out, all the FBI really
wants for me is to a coorperate.

2818
02:37:09,578 --> 02:37:14,379
You know.. turns out i have so much information
about the stock market and the Wallstreet..

2819
02:37:14,416 --> 02:37:19,580
That i could save the government years of
heartache not to mention countless dollars.

2820
02:37:21,389 --> 02:37:23,323
It gets even better babe.

2821
02:37:23,358 --> 02:37:29,297
Because if i do to sign cooperate, i might
only be looking at 4 short years.

2822
02:37:29,364 --> 02:37:33,493
How much case, we could start
fresh maybe sell the house.

2823
02:37:33,500 --> 02:37:37,368
And any fine that i have to pay
wouldn't due till i serve term.

2824
02:37:37,404 --> 02:37:41,362
So, we still have plenty
money left over, you know.

2825
02:37:42,375 --> 02:37:47,472
You think, of course bug me out a little
bit is this whole idea for doing it.

2826
02:37:47,513 --> 02:37:49,481
Give an information about my friends.

2827
02:37:49,582 --> 02:37:53,347
Ohh, like he said, ther is
no friend on Wallstrett right.

2828
02:37:53,351 --> 02:37:54,443
Right.

2829
02:37:54,519 --> 02:37:58,512
It's exactly silver lining to that
too honey because they said eventually.

2830
02:37:58,557 --> 02:38:01,423
Eventually everyone gonna have to
give an information on this case.

2831
02:38:01,458 --> 02:38:04,484
So at the end of the day, might
not even a factor, you know.

2832
02:38:04,495 --> 02:38:08,488
- Well, that's a good news, right.
- Yeah, yeah.

2833
02:38:08,532 --> 02:38:10,591
I'm really happy for you.

2834
02:38:12,368 --> 02:38:15,496
What do you mean you happy for me?

2835
02:38:15,572 --> 02:38:19,508
- You should be happy for the both of us right?
- Yeah right.

2836
02:38:19,542 --> 02:38:20,566
Alright.

2837
02:38:22,477 --> 02:38:24,308

2838
02:38:24,546 --> 02:38:27,515

2839
02:38:28,483 --> 02:38:31,417

2840
02:38:31,452 --> 02:38:33,579

2845
02:38:50,570 --> 02:38:54,300
