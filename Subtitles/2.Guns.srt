1
00:01:27,844 --> 00:01:29,091
- Hi.
- Hi.

2
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,353
How many?

3
00:01:32,322 --> 00:01:33,722
Two.

4
00:02:02,152 --> 00:02:06,990
Listen, I wanted to get a safe deposit box.
Can you do that for me?

5
00:02:14,765 --> 00:02:17,066
Okay.
Your box will be available

6
00:02:17,068 --> 00:02:18,836
any time from an
hour after opening

7
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:21,372
to 30 minutes before close.
This is your key.

8
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:22,840
Thank you.

9
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:24,875
Oh, um, also, if you open
a checking account,

10
00:02:24,877 --> 00:02:27,878
we'll give you 5% off the box along
with free overdraft protection.

11
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,179
Oh, here I was hopin'
for a free toaster.

12
00:02:32,184 --> 00:02:34,385
Why would a bank
give out free toasters?

13
00:02:36,321 --> 00:02:37,721
Hello, Ma.

14
00:02:37,723 --> 00:02:39,690
I'm ordering you
the French toast.

15
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:42,726
<i>Our very patient waitress,
Maggie,</i>

16
00:02:42,728 --> 00:02:43,894
<i>well, at least it says
Maggie on her name tag,</i>

17
00:02:43,896 --> 00:02:45,195
has asked me to order four times.

18
00:02:45,197 --> 00:02:46,898
If I don't order at this point,
it's just rude.

19
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,366
I can come back.
No, it's okay.

20
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:49,968
You know what? I'm making
an executive decision.

21
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:53,404
<i>No pancakes. I don't like pancakes.
No pancakes.</i>

22
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:58,876
I'm thinkin' hash, but only if it's
like chunky style, okay?

23
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:01,980
<i>Listen, if you order me eggs and pancakes,
I'm gonna kick your behind.</i>

24
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:05,450
But you gotta eat breakfast.
It's the most important meal of the day.

25
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:07,919
Uh, ma'am, ignore everything
he said, okay?

26
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:10,755
Don't bring me any
eggs and pancakes.

27
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:14,225
Just bring me some coffee
and bring him a couple eggs.

28
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:15,895
I don't want eggs.
I want hash.

29
00:03:15,897 --> 00:03:17,062
You know what,
put a couple eggs on it.

30
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:18,296
Give him some rye toast, too.

31
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:19,931
No rye toast for me.
I don't like rye toast.

32
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:24,002
Maybe a little silver-dollar one.
You got the little baby ones?

33
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:27,138
No pancakes, no silver dollars,
no rye toast. I like pumpernickel.

34
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,140
I do have pumpernickel.
Pumpernickel toast.

35
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:31,210
Hey, Maggie, wait. One more thing.
Yeah.

36
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:33,345
That's for you. You take that with you
till we see each other again

37
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:35,281
in case you miss me
too much, okay?

38
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:39,218
Why you gotta do that?
What?

39
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,052
Wink at the waitresses like that?

40
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,454
Waitresses like me.
Nobody likes you.

41
00:03:43,255 --> 00:03:44,390
So?
So.

42
00:03:44,392 --> 00:03:45,491
What do ya got?

43
00:03:45,493 --> 00:03:47,993
So, it is a sleepy bank.

44
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:49,762
Doable?
That's correct.

45
00:03:49,764 --> 00:03:51,063
I told you.

46
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:57,203
That is a lot of doughnuts.

47
00:04:01,343 --> 00:04:05,010
Maggie, your hot homemade doughnuts,
they any good?

48
00:04:05,012 --> 00:04:07,113
Best in three counties.
I'll tell you what you do.

49
00:04:07,115 --> 00:04:09,181
You bring us three
of those bad boys.

50
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:10,483
Put 'em in a to-go box
for us, all right?

51
00:04:10,485 --> 00:04:11,817
All right.
Thank you.

52
00:04:14,055 --> 00:04:15,822
All right, time to make the move.

53
00:04:15,824 --> 00:04:18,125
All right, there's gonna be
some sirens in this bitch.

54
00:04:18,127 --> 00:04:19,493
I'm gonna go
shake the weasel.

55
00:04:19,495 --> 00:04:22,896
Shake the weasel.
Gonna go shake the weasel.

56
00:04:22,898 --> 00:04:24,831
Hey. Good morning, sir.
How are you? Morning.

57
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:25,866
Hey, Maggie.

58
00:04:27,236 --> 00:04:28,435
I'm very sorry
about my friend.

59
00:04:28,437 --> 00:04:30,437
He was kicked in
the head as a child.

60
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:32,272
He's really not that bad.
No, he is.

61
00:04:38,113 --> 00:04:39,412
What's goin' on?

62
00:04:39,414 --> 00:04:43,451
Okay, I'm just gonna have you all
exit the building.

63
00:04:43,453 --> 00:04:46,287
It might be a false alarm,
but just do it safely.

64
00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:49,824
Thank you.
Thank you.

65
00:04:49,826 --> 00:04:51,392
Is everybody out?
I'm gonna need you to step outside.

66
00:04:51,394 --> 00:04:52,492
All right, Maggie,
I'm just gonna grab my friend.

67
00:04:52,494 --> 00:04:53,794
Okay.
We gotta pay our bill.

68
00:04:57,366 --> 00:04:58,332
We should go.

69
00:04:59,968 --> 00:05:01,135
Is that all you're
gonna leave for a tip?

70
00:05:01,137 --> 00:05:02,870
It's 15%.
You leave 15%.

71
00:05:02,872 --> 00:05:04,071
No, you gotta
leave at least 30.

72
00:05:04,073 --> 00:05:06,274
No, you don't.
15% is standard.

73
00:05:06,276 --> 00:05:08,376
My Maggie's about to be out
of a job, man. Don't be cheap.

74
00:05:08,378 --> 00:05:10,145
Okay, there's five.
That's seven.

75
00:05:10,147 --> 00:05:11,580
There you go.
Come on.

76
00:05:11,582 --> 00:05:12,514
All right.

77
00:05:14,217 --> 00:05:15,416
What?
No, you didn't.

78
00:05:15,418 --> 00:05:16,984
Yes, I did.
Oh, my God.

79
00:05:17,953 --> 00:05:19,220
How'd you say it?

80
00:05:19,222 --> 00:05:20,855
Never rob a bank
across from the diner

81
00:05:20,857 --> 00:05:22,023
with the best doughnuts
in three counties?

82
00:05:22,025 --> 00:05:23,124
That's correct.

83
00:05:54,258 --> 00:05:57,360
Bobby. Papi's down
in the stables.

84
00:05:57,362 --> 00:05:59,062
Why don't you get
somethin' to eat?

85
00:05:59,064 --> 00:06:00,330
I'm not hungry.

86
00:06:00,332 --> 00:06:02,031
Sure you are.
I wanna come with you.

87
00:06:02,033 --> 00:06:05,200
Hey, listen. We're here to do business.
Diplomatically.

88
00:06:05,202 --> 00:06:06,268
Well, I can be diplomatic.

89
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,071
You can be hungry,
too, right?

90
00:06:08,073 --> 00:06:09,339
Bobby.

91
00:06:10,574 --> 00:06:12,008
Wait here.
Okay.

92
00:06:13,277 --> 00:06:14,177
Somebody sittin' here?

93
00:06:14,179 --> 00:06:15,645
Toro.

94
00:06:15,647 --> 00:06:17,947
Oh, well, you move your feet,
you lose your seat, right?

95
00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:20,049
Lose your head, too.
That's correct.

96
00:06:20,051 --> 00:06:22,119
So, where is Little Toro?

97
00:06:22,121 --> 00:06:23,921
<i>Allí, where you put him.</i>

98
00:06:27,124 --> 00:06:28,892
<i>Aqui?
Allí.</i>

99
00:06:38,603 --> 00:06:40,004
Let's play some dominoes.

100
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,406
Papi's ready.
Yeah.

101
00:06:51,116 --> 00:06:52,483
Papi Greco!

102
00:06:53,385 --> 00:06:55,152
"I-know-a-guy" Bobby.

103
00:06:56,734 --> 00:07:01,158
Quick, an ostrich, a tank of ether,
a '63 Impala convertible.

104
00:07:01,693 --> 00:07:03,160
Make it a '64.

105
00:07:03,162 --> 00:07:04,996
My side of the border.

106
00:07:04,998 --> 00:07:06,064
I know a guy.

107
00:07:08,068 --> 00:07:10,936
What did I tell you?
He never says no, never says maybe,

108
00:07:10,938 --> 00:07:13,705
never says, "I'll see
what I can do. "

109
00:07:17,043 --> 00:07:18,310
Nice bull.

110
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:21,012
I hope he's a good breeder.

111
00:07:21,014 --> 00:07:22,981
That's a shame
about Little Toro.

112
00:07:22,983 --> 00:07:24,449
Julio caught him skimming.

113
00:07:24,451 --> 00:07:25,951
Oh.

114
00:07:25,953 --> 00:07:27,986
That don't sound like Little Toro.

115
00:07:27,988 --> 00:07:29,521
Is that for me?
That's correct.

116
00:07:32,058 --> 00:07:34,694
Everybody skims a little cream.
It's human nature.

117
00:07:34,696 --> 00:07:38,096
Just 'cause it's human
don't mean you let it go.

118
00:07:38,098 --> 00:07:39,230
Hmm.

119
00:07:44,637 --> 00:07:46,104
Nice lines. Good color.

120
00:07:46,106 --> 00:07:47,173
That's right.

121
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,641
He knows a guy.

122
00:07:52,646 --> 00:07:53,980
What you got for me?

123
00:07:58,018 --> 00:07:59,285
Cash.

124
00:08:00,053 --> 00:08:01,354
Cash?

125
00:08:04,424 --> 00:08:06,359
Supposed to be givin' me
100,000 to deal.

126
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:08,094
Why didn't you give me $100,000
worth of cocaine?

127
00:08:09,463 --> 00:08:11,230
Where's the cocaine?

128
00:08:11,232 --> 00:08:12,999
My buyer wants cocaine.

129
00:08:13,001 --> 00:08:14,600
So let him buy cocaine.

130
00:08:14,602 --> 00:08:17,404
That's what he's tryin' to do.
He's trying to buy cocaine.

131
00:08:17,406 --> 00:08:19,740
I told him I knew a guy,
therefore I come to you.

132
00:08:19,742 --> 00:08:21,508
You the guy I know.
That's why I told him.

133
00:08:23,745 --> 00:08:26,445
So take back the passports.

134
00:08:26,447 --> 00:08:30,183
After Little Toro, we're not takin' on
any new customers.

135
00:08:30,185 --> 00:08:31,785
Well, no disrespect,
but I ain't no new customer.

136
00:08:31,787 --> 00:08:34,321
You been dealin' with me
for a long time.

137
00:08:34,323 --> 00:08:35,555
You keep the passports.

138
00:08:37,525 --> 00:08:39,292
Keep the money, too.

139
00:08:39,294 --> 00:08:41,094
When you're ready to give me the product,
give me the product.

140
00:08:41,096 --> 00:08:42,062
Till then...

141
00:08:43,264 --> 00:08:44,565
You owe me.

142
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:02,450
It's not very sporting, man.

143
00:09:02,452 --> 00:09:04,519
At least give the chickens
a chance to shoot back.

144
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:09,657
Hey, man, I'm just sayin'.
If I'm gonna kill a defenseless animal,

145
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:12,294
I'm gonna honor its sacrifice by
grilling it into some tasty barbecue.

146
00:09:12,296 --> 00:09:14,262
What I'm not gonna do
is torture it

147
00:09:14,264 --> 00:09:16,697
just to prove I can't hit anything
further away than my own pecker.

148
00:09:16,699 --> 00:09:19,300
<i>Your cuate's a real junkyard dog.
Mmm.</i>

149
00:09:27,143 --> 00:09:30,179
Hey, cowboy.
You, the pretty one.

150
00:09:30,181 --> 00:09:33,482
You ever hear the expression,
"You got a face only a mother can love"?

151
00:09:33,484 --> 00:09:36,384
That don't apply to you. You are
uglier than the devil's asshole itself.

152
00:09:36,386 --> 00:09:37,485
Stig!

153
00:09:38,821 --> 00:09:40,254
What are you doin'?

154
00:09:40,256 --> 00:09:42,324
They're torturing chickens, man.

155
00:09:42,326 --> 00:09:43,492
What are you eatin'?

156
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,127
A chicken.

157
00:09:45,129 --> 00:09:46,562
Come here. It's not
the same thing, okay?

158
00:09:46,564 --> 00:09:49,098
See that bag over
there by the table?

159
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,766
Buffet table next
to the potato salad.

160
00:09:50,768 --> 00:09:52,367
Yeah, the bowling bag.
What about it?

161
00:09:52,369 --> 00:09:54,369
Little Toro's head
is in that bag.

162
00:09:55,206 --> 00:09:56,706
Bullshit.
Yeah.

163
00:09:57,741 --> 00:10:00,175
You know what?
That's fucked up, man.

164
00:10:00,177 --> 00:10:02,411
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Let's go. Okay? Come on, let's go.

165
00:10:05,816 --> 00:10:07,649
Say it in English, you goat fuck.

166
00:10:08,586 --> 00:10:12,288
That's funny comin'
from you, fat boy.

167
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:13,623
You ain't seen your pecker
since you were a baby.

168
00:10:15,427 --> 00:10:19,229
and brown shit comes out don't mean
it's your asshole.

169
00:10:19,231 --> 00:10:20,763
What did you say?
Don't worry about it, man.

170
00:10:26,671 --> 00:10:28,738
Now dig 'em up and make some
damn barbecue.

171
00:10:33,878 --> 00:10:35,845
<i>Bye, chica.</i>

172
00:10:35,847 --> 00:10:37,547
Did you just wink at him?

173
00:10:37,549 --> 00:10:39,782
- I did wink at him, 'cause he's
my bitch now. - Uh-oh!

174
00:10:41,686 --> 00:10:43,621
<i>That's good shootin'.
Gracias.</i>

175
00:10:49,426 --> 00:10:52,696
You know, Little Toro never did
nothin' to nobody, man.

176
00:10:52,698 --> 00:10:55,733
We should rip off Papi's stash at
the Tres Cruces Savings and Loan.

177
00:10:55,735 --> 00:10:57,401
You know, Papi's guy
delivers a briefcase

178
00:10:57,403 --> 00:10:59,203
full of money to Tres Cruces
every two weeks.

179
00:10:59,205 --> 00:11:01,639
That's gotta add up to, what,
like three million at least.

180
00:11:01,641 --> 00:11:04,675
If Papi knew we were even talkin'
about rippin' off Tres Cruces,

181
00:11:04,677 --> 00:11:07,679
it would be our heads in that bag
next to the potato salad.

182
00:11:07,681 --> 00:11:10,515
No way. Our two heads would
never fit in a bag that small.

183
00:11:14,586 --> 00:11:16,287
Come on, man,
let's hit the bank.

184
00:11:16,289 --> 00:11:18,422
Little Toro was your friend.
He was my friend.

185
00:11:18,424 --> 00:11:20,491
So?
What do you mean "so"?

186
00:11:20,493 --> 00:11:23,528
What if it was me? What if it was my head
Papi ran through the saw mill?

187
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,530
You wouldn't come after him?
Nope.

188
00:11:25,532 --> 00:11:29,334
Shit, man, he did that to you, I'd kill him.
You know why I'd kill him?

189
00:11:29,336 --> 00:11:30,669
Because you're my people
and there's a code.

190
00:11:30,671 --> 00:11:32,470
There is no code, first of all.

191
00:11:32,472 --> 00:11:34,605
You do whatever you gotta do,
whatever it takes.

192
00:11:34,607 --> 00:11:35,707
And second?

193
00:11:37,243 --> 00:11:39,945
Right, we're not people
'cause you don't have people.

194
00:11:39,947 --> 00:11:41,213
That's correct.

195
00:11:44,383 --> 00:11:46,218
Purpose for your
visit to Mexico?

196
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:49,789
My aunt in Tuba City had a heart
attack so we cut our trip short.

197
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:53,426
Tuba City?

198
00:11:53,428 --> 00:11:54,627
It's near Odessa.

199
00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:55,828
Nice place?

200
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:58,630
Hellhole,
but she's my favorite aunt.

201
00:11:58,632 --> 00:12:00,632
Don't move. Let me see your hands.
Oh, shit.

202
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,571
Tell us about your trip.
Lawyer.

203
00:12:06,573 --> 00:12:07,807
What's the big deal?
Lawyer.

204
00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:09,809
You were down in Sonora,
weren't you?

205
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,982
You don't think Agent Jessup and the DEA
know about you and Papi Greco?

206
00:12:15,984 --> 00:12:17,416
Lawyer. Lawyer.

207
00:12:17,418 --> 00:12:18,485
They know you were
at his ranch.

208
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,320
I know I need a lawyer.

209
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:22,321
Tell Agent Rees
about Papi Greco.

210
00:12:22,323 --> 00:12:25,458
Who?
Papi Greco.

211
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:28,861
Well, who's that? Some Mexican Santa
Claus or something?

212
00:12:28,863 --> 00:12:30,963
Come on, Mr. Stigman.

213
00:12:30,965 --> 00:12:34,334
I think it's in your best interest
to cooperate.

214
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:36,970
You need to stop playin'
the stupid card, all right?

215
00:12:36,972 --> 00:12:39,306
Well, ma'am, it's my intent to cooperate
with whatever you need.

216
00:12:39,308 --> 00:12:41,408
I mean, as an American,
I know you're just doin' your job,

217
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:43,543
and sometimes innocent folks like me
get caught up in the system.

218
00:12:43,545 --> 00:12:45,811
It's like the airlines. They don't
lose your luggage on purpose, right?

219
00:12:45,813 --> 00:12:47,714
But everybody takes it
so damn personal.

220
00:12:47,716 --> 00:12:50,450
Come on, Mr. Stigman.
So you wanna play games?

221
00:12:50,452 --> 00:12:52,786
Well, what'd you
have in mind?

222
00:12:52,788 --> 00:12:54,554
Do you wanna help yourself?
Yes.

223
00:12:55,923 --> 00:12:56,823
Do I have to do it
in front of him?

224
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,363
All right, we're done here.
Thank you, Mr. Stigman.

225
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:03,665
You gonna leave?
Oh, yes.

226
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:05,867
Wow.

227
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:07,669
Oh, my God.

228
00:13:07,671 --> 00:13:09,803
How do you concentrate
workin' with her, man?

229
00:13:21,617 --> 00:13:23,985
Five border agents are rippin' apart
your car as we speak.

230
00:13:23,987 --> 00:13:25,453
They ain't gonna
find anything.

231
00:13:31,328 --> 00:13:32,961
Where'd you hide
the cocaine?

232
00:13:32,963 --> 00:13:34,962
Can they hear us?
No.

233
00:13:34,964 --> 00:13:36,564
Can they see us?
No.

234
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:37,932
Okay.

235
00:13:38,867 --> 00:13:40,435
There was no cocaine.

236
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:45,974
You had a deal in place.
Right.

237
00:13:45,976 --> 00:13:48,110
Five hundred passports
in return for cocaine.

238
00:13:48,112 --> 00:13:49,712
Right.

239
00:13:49,714 --> 00:13:50,979
Hey, Bobby.

240
00:13:50,981 --> 00:13:55,451
Good. Man, your boy Stig's
a piece of work.

241
00:13:56,852 --> 00:13:57,885
He winked at you,
didn't he?

242
00:13:59,489 --> 00:14:01,056
How'd you know?

243
00:14:01,058 --> 00:14:02,758
Bobby didn't
get the cocaine.

244
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,993
What?
What happened?

245
00:14:04,995 --> 00:14:07,696
Papi offered me cash.
I told him no.

246
00:14:07,698 --> 00:14:10,366
I told him
to keep the passports,

247
00:14:10,368 --> 00:14:12,469
so, eventually, he's gotta come up
with the cocaine.

248
00:14:12,471 --> 00:14:14,904
What about this guy you said
you could flip? Little Toro?

249
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,441
I got him.
It's real close.

250
00:14:19,944 --> 00:14:21,910
I don't know
who you are anymore.

251
00:14:22,479 --> 00:14:24,446
It's like...

252
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:26,382
It's like you're
out on this limb.

253
00:14:26,384 --> 00:14:28,651
And you've been out
there way too long.

254
00:14:28,653 --> 00:14:30,387
And you're sayin'
that to say what?

255
00:14:30,389 --> 00:14:32,155
I don't like goin' to the funerals
of my own men.

256
00:14:32,157 --> 00:14:34,491
Well, then don't come,
boss. Don't come.

257
00:14:34,493 --> 00:14:35,892
Okay?

258
00:14:35,894 --> 00:14:37,794
I spent the last
three years of my life

259
00:14:37,796 --> 00:14:41,732
tryin' to work my way
up the line to get next to Papi Greco.

260
00:14:41,734 --> 00:14:43,534
You can't take me
off this now.

261
00:14:43,536 --> 00:14:44,734
Jessup, he's close.

262
00:14:44,736 --> 00:14:46,603
You can't take me off this now.
I know.

263
00:14:46,971 --> 00:14:48,405
Not now.

264
00:14:51,876 --> 00:14:54,144
Two weeks.

265
00:14:54,146 --> 00:14:56,781
You don't flip Little Toro by then,
I'm pullin' ya out.

266
00:15:00,051 --> 00:15:01,152
We're done.

267
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:21,038
Think Jessup
knows about us?

268
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,176
What "us"?
You don't do "us," remember?

269
00:15:25,111 --> 00:15:26,578
Oh, I remember.

270
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:29,448
Besides, I'm dating.

271
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:31,649
Oh, right, right.
You're dating...

272
00:15:31,651 --> 00:15:32,983
Mmm-hmm.

273
00:15:32,985 --> 00:15:36,487
...your imaginary
boyfriend, Harvey.

274
00:15:36,489 --> 00:15:39,524
Uh, he's not my boyfriend,
and his name's not Harvey.

275
00:15:39,526 --> 00:15:42,794
I like Harvey.
It has a nice ring to it. Harvey.

276
00:15:42,796 --> 00:15:44,629
You don't get to be jealous
anymore, Bobby.

277
00:15:44,631 --> 00:15:45,931
Harvey.

278
00:15:46,499 --> 00:15:48,166
You pushed me away.

279
00:15:48,168 --> 00:15:49,868
So you could
be with Harvey.

280
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,236
Fuck you.

281
00:15:56,609 --> 00:15:58,243
You told Jessup you were close
to flipping him.

282
00:15:58,245 --> 00:16:00,045
I was.

283
00:16:00,047 --> 00:16:01,913
But when I got
down to the ranch,

284
00:16:01,915 --> 00:16:04,049
Papi's boys was throwin' his head
around in a bag.

285
00:16:04,051 --> 00:16:06,586
Well, that's game, then.

286
00:16:06,588 --> 00:16:09,956
With Little Toro off the board,
Jessup's pulling you out.

287
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:11,157
Not if you
don't tell him.

288
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:12,892
I'm your control, Bobby.
That's correct.

289
00:16:12,894 --> 00:16:14,026
I have to tell him.

290
00:16:14,028 --> 00:16:17,930
That's why I need you

291
00:16:17,932 --> 00:16:21,033
to let me rob
Tres Cruces Savings and Loan.

292
00:16:21,035 --> 00:16:24,770
No, Stig wants to rob
the bank. It's his idea.

293
00:16:24,772 --> 00:16:26,038
So there's no entrapment.

294
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,708
What I want
is access to that money

295
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:30,943
that Papi's got
in the safe deposit box.

296
00:16:30,945 --> 00:16:32,278
You know no judge
is gonna give you

297
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,247
a blanket warrant
for the boxes.

298
00:16:34,249 --> 00:16:37,050
We don't need a warrant.
Not if the money's evidence in a crime.

299
00:16:37,052 --> 00:16:38,652
We just trace it
back to ownership,

300
00:16:38,654 --> 00:16:41,154
we got Papi on tax evasion,
possible RICO.

301
00:16:41,823 --> 00:16:43,523
Yeah?
Yeah.

302
00:16:43,525 --> 00:16:44,690
And what about Stig?

303
00:16:44,692 --> 00:16:45,791
What about him?

304
00:16:45,793 --> 00:16:47,126
He's a side dish.

305
00:16:47,128 --> 00:16:51,164
he does a smooth 20 years
in the penitentiary, you get a medal.

306
00:16:52,634 --> 00:16:55,135
The bank gets us Papi.

307
00:16:56,237 --> 00:16:58,705
And that's all
that matters, right?

308
00:16:58,707 --> 00:17:00,941
It takes whatever
it takes, baby.

309
00:17:00,943 --> 00:17:03,010
Did you ever
really love me?

310
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:04,612
Hmm?

311
00:17:05,881 --> 00:17:07,180
I really meant
to love you.

312
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:34,309
Shit.

313
00:17:35,744 --> 00:17:37,645
You don't have to knock.
It's always open.

314
00:17:37,647 --> 00:17:39,814
Yeah, good.
Let's hit the bank.

315
00:17:39,816 --> 00:17:41,015
Let's hit the bank.

316
00:17:41,017 --> 00:17:42,784
The Tres Cruces?
That's correct.

317
00:17:42,786 --> 00:17:44,752
Oh, shit.

318
00:17:44,754 --> 00:17:46,956
Here I am still spinnin' about how we
got yanked outta line at the border.

319
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:49,325
So you in or you out?

320
00:17:49,327 --> 00:17:51,594
I'm in, yeah.
It's just...

321
00:17:51,596 --> 00:17:53,861
Have you ever had anything like that
happen to you before?

322
00:17:53,863 --> 00:17:56,331
I mean, they were 100% convinced
we were holding.

323
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,800
And we would've if Papi hadn't
welched on that coke.

324
00:18:00,269 --> 00:18:02,338
So you're sayin'
that to say what?

325
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,906
I'm sayin' it's only 'cause
you're hearin' it.

326
00:18:03,908 --> 00:18:05,841
No, you sayin' somethin'.

327
00:18:05,843 --> 00:18:07,343
And if you sayin' it,
I'm hearin' it 'cause you're sayin' it.

328
00:18:07,345 --> 00:18:08,677
What are you sayin'?
Let it be said.

329
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:09,912
I think you're
fuckin' playin' me.

330
00:18:09,914 --> 00:18:11,080
You wanna be played?

331
00:18:11,082 --> 00:18:12,815
I've been at your
hip for 10 months,

332
00:18:12,817 --> 00:18:13,983
but after this,
I think maybe you're playin' me.

333
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,257
I got you.
No, you didn't.

334
00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:23,726
Oh, I did. The corner
of your eye was twitchin'.

335
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:25,194
The corner?
That wasn't a twitch.

336
00:18:25,196 --> 00:18:27,096
That was a wink.
That's my move.

337
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:45,649
Yup, that's Papi's chubby
little kid right there.

338
00:18:45,651 --> 00:18:47,183
Feed that motherfucker
quesadillas...

339
00:18:47,185 --> 00:18:48,284
Oh, my God.

340
00:18:48,286 --> 00:18:49,352
She's chubby, too.

341
00:18:49,354 --> 00:18:53,189
How does an old, fat, ugly
fuck get a girl like that?

342
00:18:53,191 --> 00:18:54,290
Money.

343
00:18:56,762 --> 00:18:57,694
All right,
here we go.

344
00:19:00,298 --> 00:19:02,767
Same thing
every two weeks.

345
00:19:02,769 --> 00:19:05,268
Papi flies over the border
with a briefcase full of cash.

346
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,770
He spends a week
with the mistress.

347
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:08,104
Ferret Nose Julio
drives it out

348
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:09,673
to the Tres Cruces
Savings and Loan.

349
00:19:09,675 --> 00:19:11,374
Think they got three
million in the bank, huh?

350
00:19:11,376 --> 00:19:12,710
Easy.

351
00:19:14,146 --> 00:19:16,047
Bingo.

352
00:19:16,049 --> 00:19:17,815
Money, money,
money, money.

353
00:19:17,817 --> 00:19:18,949
Oh, yeah.

354
00:20:02,462 --> 00:20:04,896
Why don't you hit the diner
and check out the doughnuts?

355
00:20:04,898 --> 00:20:08,133
I'm kinda more in a corned beef
hash mood, to tell you the truth.

356
00:20:08,135 --> 00:20:09,234
You never heard
the saying,

357
00:20:09,236 --> 00:20:11,003
"Never rob a bank
across from a diner

358
00:20:11,005 --> 00:20:13,005
"that has the best
doughnuts in three counties"?

359
00:20:13,007 --> 00:20:15,007
That's not a saying.
Yes, it is.

360
00:20:15,009 --> 00:20:17,175
I get what you're sayin', but it's
not a saying. You never heard it?

361
00:20:17,177 --> 00:20:18,110
It is a saying.
It's a saying now.

362
00:20:18,112 --> 00:20:19,211
Okay. Let you tell it.

363
00:20:30,524 --> 00:20:31,924
Make the move.

364
00:20:46,807 --> 00:20:49,108
Bad DEA agent.

365
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,543
Am I bad?
Yes, you are.

366
00:20:50,545 --> 00:20:51,844
I'm a bad girl?

367
00:20:51,846 --> 00:20:52,913
Yes, you are.

368
00:20:56,251 --> 00:20:59,253
Stig decided to hit
the bank tomorrow, 3:00.

369
00:21:00,488 --> 00:21:02,289
Stig decided?

370
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:05,057
Well, with or without me, he's goin' in.

371
00:21:05,059 --> 00:21:06,927
Well, I still haven't
talked to Jessup.

372
00:21:06,929 --> 00:21:09,396
Stig doesn't know that.
3:00 tomorrow he's goin' in.

373
00:21:09,398 --> 00:21:11,565
If we want Papi,
I gotta go in with him.

374
00:21:14,804 --> 00:21:16,970
You're not even gonna
give me a choice, are you?

375
00:21:16,972 --> 00:21:22,043
I'm givin' you no other
options as a way to protect you.

376
00:21:22,045 --> 00:21:26,414
Just have the troops meet me outside
the bank, 3:05 when we come out.

377
00:21:27,448 --> 00:21:28,515
3:05.

378
00:21:28,517 --> 00:21:30,117
Okay. And don't shoot me.

379
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:32,119
Even if you want to.
We'll see.

380
00:22:14,197 --> 00:22:15,463
License and registration, cowboy.

381
00:22:17,433 --> 00:22:18,500
Cute.

382
00:22:20,937 --> 00:22:22,638
What's up, Teemo?
What's up, brother?

383
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,440
How are you, brother? I miss
you, man. I miss you, man.

384
00:22:24,442 --> 00:22:26,408
Got you a turkey burger.
Special sauce.

385
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:27,877
Commander wants
to see you.

386
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:28,878
Yes, sir.

387
00:22:30,013 --> 00:22:32,916
So, half a mile from home.

388
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:35,218
I got Bobby all wound
up and ready to go, sir.

389
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,653
Ordnance you requested.

390
00:22:38,922 --> 00:22:40,656
Do you know, the Admiral's
proud of what you've done.

391
00:22:40,658 --> 00:22:42,124
You've gone way
out on a limb.

392
00:22:42,126 --> 00:22:44,093
If the bank falls
right tomorrow,

393
00:22:44,095 --> 00:22:45,928
he says you can come in from
the cold, rejoin your brothers.

394
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:48,565
Great. Be good just to put
the uniform back on, sir.

395
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:51,167
I didn't join the Navy to commit
felonies and hang with drug dealers.

396
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:53,303
Even if you're
damn good at it?

397
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:55,105
I do what I do
for the Navy, sir.

398
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:56,539
It's all part of
the Admiral's plan.

399
00:22:56,541 --> 00:23:00,243
we run cross-border ops on
Papi and all the other cartels.

400
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:02,545
So tomorrow,
clean and precise.

401
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:05,382
Tick all the boxes, nothing
left undone. You got it?

402
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,683
Yes, sir.

403
00:23:07,218 --> 00:23:09,419
Let's go.

404
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:16,227
Hey, nice jacket.

405
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:17,561
Hey, tell your mother
she's gotta move out

406
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:19,163
of my house
at some point, man.

407
00:24:00,139 --> 00:24:02,274
All right, what do you
want, clown or Frankie?

408
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:04,242
Frankie.

409
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:21,259
So, what'd you do
with the. 22?

410
00:24:21,261 --> 00:24:23,762
Traded to my cousin
for an espresso machine.

411
00:24:23,764 --> 00:24:25,630
You're gonna need special
beans for that, right?

412
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:30,169
You can reach for your
firearm, but do it real slow.

413
00:24:30,171 --> 00:24:32,305
Any other people
in the buildin'?

414
00:24:32,307 --> 00:24:34,307
What the hell is this?
It's a bank robbery.

415
00:24:34,309 --> 00:24:35,408
Only instead
of robbin' the bank

416
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:36,742
and lettin' you
chase after us,

417
00:24:36,744 --> 00:24:38,677
we decided to come
after you first.

418
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:39,544
Let's go.

419
00:24:54,796 --> 00:24:59,266
All right, everybody sit down.
Everybody sit down on the floor.

420
00:24:59,268 --> 00:25:02,035
Ladies behind the counter, keep your
hands visible, not on the alarms.

421
00:25:02,037 --> 00:25:06,139
It's all right, girls. Just
give 'em the drawer cash.

422
00:25:06,141 --> 00:25:07,774
Did we ask
for the drawer cash?

423
00:25:07,776 --> 00:25:09,810
Come on, come on, come on.
Sit right here. Sit, sit.

424
00:25:09,812 --> 00:25:11,345
Let's go, on the floor.

425
00:25:11,347 --> 00:25:13,680
Hey, guard!
Hey! Hey.

426
00:25:15,817 --> 00:25:18,218
Look, I'm tryin' to
be polite, all right?

427
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,354
Just sit tight and
this'll be over soon.

428
00:25:20,356 --> 00:25:22,289
Open the gate.

429
00:25:22,291 --> 00:25:23,557
I don't have a key.

430
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:24,625
What'd you say?

431
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:31,565
You lie to me again, it's gonna
be more than a fuckin' problem.

432
00:25:31,567 --> 00:25:32,766
Get out there, now.

433
00:25:32,768 --> 00:25:33,834
Get on the floor.

434
00:25:35,337 --> 00:25:36,570
You good? I'm goin' in.

435
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:51,251
Shh.
It's all right.

436
00:25:51,253 --> 00:25:52,554
Oh, Timothy.

437
00:25:53,823 --> 00:25:56,091
Hey, it's okay.

438
00:25:56,093 --> 00:25:59,260
It's okay. Yeah?

439
00:25:59,262 --> 00:26:01,196
Okay. Here you go.

440
00:26:06,368 --> 00:26:09,772
Showtime!
Fire in the hole!

441
00:26:24,354 --> 00:26:25,721
Holy shit!

442
00:26:27,224 --> 00:26:29,358
Hey, Frankie,
somethin's not right.

443
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,427
They're all
stuffed with money.

444
00:26:31,429 --> 00:26:33,395
I thought you said there
would only be one or two.

445
00:26:33,397 --> 00:26:35,263
Every single one of them.

446
00:26:35,265 --> 00:26:37,600
I'm at 32 boxes
and counting.

447
00:26:37,602 --> 00:26:39,568
Look, there's way
more than 3 million.

448
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:42,605
And there's still
a lot more here.

449
00:26:42,607 --> 00:26:44,473
All right, well, take 'em
all. We'll figure it out later.

450
00:26:53,284 --> 00:26:54,217
You go ahead,
I'll get the rest.

451
00:26:54,219 --> 00:26:55,352
All right.

452
00:26:56,554 --> 00:26:58,421
Listen.

453
00:26:58,423 --> 00:27:00,923
May be gunfire outside,
okay? So if it hits,

454
00:27:00,925 --> 00:27:02,825
you get everybody
behind the counters.

455
00:27:02,827 --> 00:27:04,461
This is for the jail
across the street.

456
00:27:04,463 --> 00:27:06,496
You let the cops out.
Let 'em out.

457
00:27:10,201 --> 00:27:11,234
Come on.

458
00:27:44,403 --> 00:27:45,870
That is a hell of a lot
more than $3 million.

459
00:27:48,374 --> 00:27:52,310
We couldn't be the luckiest chumps
on the face of the earth, could we?

460
00:27:52,312 --> 00:27:53,945
You feel lucky?
No, I don't.

461
00:27:53,947 --> 00:27:55,913
I mean, this can't
be Papi's money.

462
00:27:55,915 --> 00:27:58,749
People are gonna chase us off the
end of the earth for money like this.

463
00:27:58,751 --> 00:28:00,885
Well, I hate to tell you this,
Stig, but I got more bad news...

464
00:28:02,355 --> 00:28:03,956
You take that hand away
nice and slow, Bobby.

465
00:28:03,958 --> 00:28:05,324
Okay.

466
00:28:05,326 --> 00:28:06,725
Put the gun down, Stig.

467
00:28:12,598 --> 00:28:13,731
You know I really
like you, right?

468
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:15,333
I like you, too.

469
00:28:15,335 --> 00:28:16,768
No, you don't.
Yes, I do.

470
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:18,570
Nobody likes me, okay?
And I'm okay with it.

471
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:20,305
I do. I like you
more than most.

472
00:28:20,307 --> 00:28:21,740
You're not just sayin' it 'cause
I got a gun pointed to you?

473
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:23,408
Why don't you just
put the gun down?

474
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:25,978
Shit.

475
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,279
Oh.

476
00:28:27,281 --> 00:28:28,747
Hot-doggin'!

477
00:28:29,616 --> 00:28:30,683
I'm sorry, man.

478
00:28:32,387 --> 00:28:33,585
What'd you
do that for?

479
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:34,886
Shit, man, I had to!
No, you didn't.

480
00:28:37,557 --> 00:28:39,324
It's just a little flesh
wound. You'll be all right.

481
00:28:39,326 --> 00:28:40,759
Drink the water,
and then you'll be able...

482
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,031
What is that?

483
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,901
In your hand. Is that
a badge in your hand?

484
00:28:50,971 --> 00:28:52,605
Tell me you're not a no-good,
two-timin' son of a bitch.

485
00:28:52,607 --> 00:28:53,706
Two-timin'?

486
00:28:53,708 --> 00:28:55,675
Tell me.
You shot me.

487
00:28:56,844 --> 00:28:58,878
DEA.

488
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,881
Hey, wait a minute. Wait
a minute, man. Hang on.

489
00:29:01,883 --> 00:29:03,483
No, you wait a minute.

490
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:05,752
Stig.

491
00:29:09,056 --> 00:29:10,490
Hey.

492
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:26,706
The United States is the
greatest country in the world

493
00:29:26,708 --> 00:29:30,544
because we accept
a man is, at his core,

494
00:29:31,313 --> 00:29:32,613
greedy,

495
00:29:32,615 --> 00:29:33,947
selfish

496
00:29:34,482 --> 00:29:35,816
and covetous.

497
00:29:35,818 --> 00:29:38,686
I had no choice.
They took my key.

498
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:40,654
I would never willingly
open the vault.

499
00:29:40,656 --> 00:29:42,691
Keep your hands
on the desk, please.

500
00:29:42,693 --> 00:29:45,059
In America,
we line everybody up.

501
00:29:45,061 --> 00:29:47,328
Say, "You're on your own.

502
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:48,794
"Grab all you can grab. "

503
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,545
I'm innocent.

504
00:29:51,966 --> 00:29:54,068
Nobody's innocent, friend.

505
00:29:54,836 --> 00:29:56,104
There's just the guilty,

506
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,606
the ignorant

507
00:29:59,508 --> 00:30:00,809
and the unlucky.

508
00:30:07,416 --> 00:30:08,849
Did you take our money?

509
00:30:11,053 --> 00:30:13,855
You fellas look like
you're waitin' for a bus.

510
00:30:13,857 --> 00:30:15,590
You guys let us know
when you're done.

511
00:30:15,592 --> 00:30:18,693
Oh, I'm done, and thank
you for the courtesy.

512
00:30:18,695 --> 00:30:19,861
Who is that guy?

513
00:30:19,863 --> 00:30:21,629
You heard of
the hidden hand of God?

514
00:30:21,631 --> 00:30:23,465
Well, that's God's
son of a bitch.

515
00:30:25,435 --> 00:30:30,072
Call the DDO and get a list of everyone
who knew we had money in this bank.

516
00:30:30,074 --> 00:30:33,675
You two realize those sunglasses
make you look like assholes.

517
00:30:33,677 --> 00:30:36,444
Excuse me,
when'd that diner burn?

518
00:30:36,446 --> 00:30:37,746
Yesterday.

519
00:30:37,748 --> 00:30:38,948
I want interviews
with the wait staff

520
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:40,483
and every customer
in the place.

521
00:30:40,485 --> 00:30:41,951
It was just
a grease fire.

522
00:30:42,819 --> 00:30:44,687
Did I ask your
opinion, Gomer?

523
00:30:46,056 --> 00:30:47,423
You ever hear
the saying,

524
00:30:47,425 --> 00:30:49,425
"Never rob a bank
across from a diner

525
00:30:49,427 --> 00:30:51,026
"with the best doughnuts
in three counties"?

526
00:30:51,995 --> 00:30:54,598
If that diner fire's
a coincidence,

527
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,832
it's only 'cause we
ain't looking hard enough.

528
00:31:07,078 --> 00:31:09,513
That is an impressive
amount of greenbacks.

529
00:31:09,515 --> 00:31:12,182
43,125,000 of 'em, sir.

530
00:31:12,184 --> 00:31:15,719
Recount it. Pack it up.
We'll stow it back in Corpus.

531
00:31:15,721 --> 00:31:17,654
It was my impression we were
supposed to come out of that bank

532
00:31:17,656 --> 00:31:18,922
with 3 million
at most, sir.

533
00:31:18,924 --> 00:31:20,456
Mmm-hmm.

534
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:21,191
Whose money was it?

535
00:31:22,727 --> 00:31:23,960
Bad men unworthy of it.

536
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:27,497
Did you know
Bobby Beans was DEA?

537
00:31:28,567 --> 00:31:33,103
No offense, sir, but you really
need to work on your surprised face.

538
00:31:33,105 --> 00:31:36,641
Well, if he was DEA,
he helped you rob a bank.

539
00:31:36,643 --> 00:31:39,010
Which means he's dirty, and
for that, I have no mercy.

540
00:31:40,946 --> 00:31:42,880
Where'd you leave him?
In the desert.

541
00:31:42,882 --> 00:31:44,981
Is he dead?
More than likely.

542
00:31:47,618 --> 00:31:48,952
"More than likely. "

543
00:31:50,756 --> 00:31:52,190
You wanna tell me
what that means?

544
00:31:52,192 --> 00:31:54,492
The whole point of you
working with Bobby Beans

545
00:31:54,494 --> 00:31:55,893
was to kill him off
and create a cut-out

546
00:31:55,895 --> 00:31:57,528
so the op couldn't
get traced back to us.

547
00:31:57,530 --> 00:31:59,464
My cover's solid. There's
no way it'll trace back.

548
00:31:59,466 --> 00:32:02,066
My cover is solid. There's
no way it'll trace back, sir.

549
00:32:02,068 --> 00:32:04,102
That's a call made
above your pay grade.

550
00:32:05,805 --> 00:32:06,938
Yes, sir.

551
00:32:11,743 --> 00:32:14,745
Assign two of the boys to stow
the money back at the naval base.

552
00:32:14,747 --> 00:32:16,848
The rest'll come with us to
check on the body of Mr. Beans.

553
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:18,550
Stigman,
wanna come with me?

554
00:32:52,152 --> 00:32:54,152
Hey there, buddy.
Hey.

555
00:32:54,154 --> 00:32:55,254
<i>You habla?</i>

556
00:32:55,256 --> 00:32:56,522
Yeah, yeah.

557
00:32:56,524 --> 00:32:57,756
<i>I hablo.</i>

558
00:32:57,758 --> 00:32:59,157
Good, that's good.

559
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:01,694
Don't trust in him
till you see his paper.

560
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:04,998
If he's got papers, I'll see his
papers. You got papers, right?

561
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,567
No. No,
I got no papers.

562
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:09,569
Well, that's gonna
be a problem.

563
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:11,571
See, Slim Jay and me,
we done assigned ourselves

564
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:13,740
protection this here
stretch of the border.

565
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:16,844
Officially unofficially.

566
00:33:16,846 --> 00:33:19,178
So we really gonna
have to see your papers.

567
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:21,014
Make sure you ain't
no Muslim or nothin'.

568
00:33:23,984 --> 00:33:26,553
Oh, yeah.
No, I do have it.

569
00:33:29,891 --> 00:33:31,725
And let me
have your gun.

570
00:33:35,163 --> 00:33:36,230
Give it to me.

571
00:33:36,965 --> 00:33:38,065
<i>Gracias.</i>

572
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:40,968
You know how to pray?

573
00:33:55,984 --> 00:33:59,054
Teemo.
How we doin', boys?

574
00:33:59,056 --> 00:34:01,356
Any sign of Bobby Beans?

575
00:34:01,358 --> 00:34:03,124
Checked all the washes
to the southeast.

576
00:34:03,793 --> 00:34:04,993
No sign of a body.

577
00:34:07,062 --> 00:34:08,062
All right.

578
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:12,867
Well, Stig, you put
us in quite a hole.

579
00:34:12,869 --> 00:34:15,604
I don't see it that way, sir, but
you're the man with the oak leaves.

580
00:34:15,606 --> 00:34:17,138
All that pride
I had in you.

581
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,774
That loyalty?

582
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:20,942
You just tossed it
to the wind.

583
00:34:20,944 --> 00:34:22,077
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry, sir.

584
00:34:33,189 --> 00:34:34,122
God damn it.

585
00:34:39,629 --> 00:34:41,062
He's in the wash!

586
00:34:41,064 --> 00:34:42,698
Go, go, go!

587
00:34:49,306 --> 00:34:51,273
Come on,
let's flush him out!

588
00:35:02,052 --> 00:35:03,853
Where you going,
Stigman?

589
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:07,957
It doesn't matter
if you run.

590
00:35:09,861 --> 00:35:13,363
Your jacket's wired, so you're
six-months AWOL after stabbing an MP.

591
00:35:15,133 --> 00:35:16,866
You talk to anyone,
they're just gonna

592
00:35:16,868 --> 00:35:18,300
hand you right
back over to me.

593
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:28,145
You all right?

594
00:35:28,147 --> 00:35:29,846
Yeah.
Then get your ass up!

595
00:35:40,124 --> 00:35:41,191
Toss the gun.

596
00:35:50,201 --> 00:35:51,268
Fuck!

597
00:35:52,236 --> 00:35:53,304
Move!

598
00:36:10,055 --> 00:36:11,089
Come on, come on!

599
00:36:14,793 --> 00:36:15,960
Damn it!

600
00:36:42,789 --> 00:36:45,357
Jesus! What am I
supposed to do with this?

601
00:36:47,427 --> 00:36:48,827
Aw, man. Aw!

602
00:36:49,429 --> 00:36:50,430
Come on.

603
00:36:51,431 --> 00:36:54,466
I'm a vet,
not a trauma surgeon.

604
00:36:54,468 --> 00:36:56,535
I can't help you with
this, man. You gotta go.

605
00:36:56,537 --> 00:36:58,103
Go where?

606
00:36:58,105 --> 00:37:00,072
You gotta leave.
I can't do anything.

607
00:37:00,074 --> 00:37:01,473
Kenny, you remember
a couple of months ago

608
00:37:01,475 --> 00:37:04,944
you offered to sell me
500 hits of ketamine?

609
00:37:04,946 --> 00:37:06,312
Yeah, you said you
weren't interested.

610
00:37:06,314 --> 00:37:07,814
Right.

611
00:37:07,816 --> 00:37:09,415
'Cause I'm a DEA agent.

612
00:37:12,319 --> 00:37:14,020
And if you don't
fix me up,

613
00:37:15,054 --> 00:37:16,822
I'm gonna go to the D.A.,

614
00:37:16,824 --> 00:37:20,226
I'm gonna tell them that you
like cruising Tori Amos concerts,

615
00:37:20,228 --> 00:37:23,296
selling Special K to
little weepy college girls.

616
00:37:23,298 --> 00:37:24,464
There's no way
you're a cop.

617
00:37:24,466 --> 00:37:25,899
No?
No.

618
00:37:25,901 --> 00:37:26,966
You sure?
I'm positive.

619
00:37:30,272 --> 00:37:32,973
You have the right
to remain silent.

620
00:37:32,975 --> 00:37:35,109
You have the right to have a
lawyer present during questioning.

621
00:37:35,111 --> 00:37:36,377
Do I need to keep going?

622
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,912
No, I'm good.
You're a cop.

623
00:37:37,914 --> 00:37:39,179
Okay.
Okay.

624
00:37:40,815 --> 00:37:42,182
Nice shirt.

625
00:37:42,184 --> 00:37:43,583
Thanks. It's JCPenney's.

626
00:37:43,585 --> 00:37:45,118
Yeah?
Yeah.

627
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,553
All right,
hold on one second.

628
00:38:22,024 --> 00:38:23,158
Welcome to the Camino Real.

629
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,459
Thank you.

630
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:36,071
Hey.

631
00:38:36,073 --> 00:38:37,505
You were late.
Jesus Christ.

632
00:38:37,507 --> 00:38:39,207
What the hell happened?

633
00:38:39,209 --> 00:38:40,876
Excuse us.
Excuse me.

634
00:38:42,078 --> 00:38:44,079
I robbed a bank.
What happened to you?

635
00:38:44,081 --> 00:38:45,548
I was there with
six agents at 3:05.

636
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:47,016
No, you weren't.
Yes, I was.

637
00:38:47,018 --> 00:38:48,084
You were late.

638
00:38:48,086 --> 00:38:49,551
You went early.

639
00:38:49,553 --> 00:38:52,921
pulled your badge at
any time and stopped it.

640
00:38:52,923 --> 00:38:54,522
I did. Stig shot me.
What?

641
00:38:54,524 --> 00:38:56,491
He shot me
in the shoulder.

642
00:38:56,493 --> 00:39:00,296
And interrupt your rendezvous
with Harvey? I don't think so.

643
00:39:00,298 --> 00:39:01,931
This is what
we need to do,

644
00:39:01,933 --> 00:39:04,166
we need to find Stig,
we need to find the money.

645
00:39:09,106 --> 00:39:10,273
All right. Listen.

646
00:39:10,275 --> 00:39:12,575
Let me go upstairs,
make my excuses,

647
00:39:12,577 --> 00:39:14,243
and then we'll find
Stig together, okay?

648
00:39:14,245 --> 00:39:16,212
Okay, let's do this.
Let's do this.

649
00:39:16,214 --> 00:39:18,014
Why don't you recheck
Stig's background?

650
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:20,349
Maybe there was something
that we missed. All right?

651
00:39:20,351 --> 00:39:24,053
I'm going to Stig's apartment
and see what I can find out.

652
00:39:24,055 --> 00:39:25,922
All right?
Okay.

653
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,360
Tell Harvey I said hi.

654
00:39:39,236 --> 00:39:40,703
Who'd you patch up?

655
00:39:42,507 --> 00:39:44,508
What are you
talking about?

656
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:47,377
What am I
talkin' about?

657
00:39:47,379 --> 00:39:49,613
Well, there's a dune
buggy parked out back

658
00:39:49,615 --> 00:39:52,115
that was stolen by a man
with a bullet hole in him.

659
00:39:53,384 --> 00:39:56,955
Now, before he had
a bullet hole in him,

660
00:39:56,957 --> 00:39:59,257
he burned down a diner
and robbed a bank.

661
00:40:00,591 --> 00:40:02,526
I don't know anything
about that, so...

662
00:40:04,128 --> 00:40:05,262
Okay.

663
00:40:06,097 --> 00:40:07,164
Okay?

664
00:40:07,166 --> 00:40:08,298
Fair enough.

665
00:40:09,734 --> 00:40:11,536
Say, let me
ask you somethin'.

666
00:40:12,738 --> 00:40:15,606
You ever play
Russian roulette?

667
00:40:17,743 --> 00:40:21,512
'Course not.
What am I thinkin'?

668
00:40:21,514 --> 00:40:25,483
The thing is,
most people,

669
00:40:25,485 --> 00:40:28,186
they put the gun
to the temple.

670
00:40:28,188 --> 00:40:30,488
And that's, well,
that's just stupid.

671
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,557
What if...

672
00:40:35,661 --> 00:40:38,129
The bullet's in
the first chamber?

673
00:40:40,568 --> 00:40:42,501
You blow a man's head off
'fore he's had a chance

674
00:40:42,503 --> 00:40:44,470
to tell you
what you want to know.

675
00:40:49,008 --> 00:40:50,274
No. No, no.
Come on, man.

676
00:40:54,748 --> 00:40:56,148
Case in point.

677
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:01,186
Stig!

678
00:41:12,365 --> 00:41:13,432
Stig.

679
00:41:24,713 --> 00:41:26,079
<i>Pick up, Bobby.</i>

680
00:41:28,249 --> 00:41:30,283
<i>What the fuck are you
doing here, Bobby?</i>

681
00:41:34,388 --> 00:41:36,089
<i>What're you
duckin' for, man?</i>

682
00:41:36,091 --> 00:41:38,525
<i>You know
I set you up, right?</i>

683
00:41:38,527 --> 00:41:40,593
<i>They told me
all about you.</i>

684
00:41:40,595 --> 00:41:44,297
<i>Tough cat. Knows everybody.
Doesn't have people.</i>

685
00:41:44,299 --> 00:41:47,133
That guy? Well, shit, that
guy's a perfect cut-out.

686
00:41:47,135 --> 00:41:49,135
I mean, he takes a bullet,
who's gonna care, right?

687
00:41:50,672 --> 00:41:52,807
Pick up the phone.

688
00:41:52,809 --> 00:41:54,175
<i>Pick up the damn
phone, Bobby.</i>

689
00:42:00,314 --> 00:42:01,414
You got anything to say?

690
00:42:01,416 --> 00:42:03,083
<i>First question,</i>

691
00:42:03,085 --> 00:42:05,219
if you're DEA and you're
clean, why are you here alone?

692
00:42:05,221 --> 00:42:06,554
Where's your backup, Bobby?

693
00:42:09,124 --> 00:42:10,624
Come on, it's this
kind of attitude

694
00:42:10,626 --> 00:42:12,159
makes me think you're
not one of the good guys.

695
00:42:14,564 --> 00:42:17,698
<i>before you walked into
that building, Bobby.</i>

696
00:42:25,574 --> 00:42:27,575
<i>That's a beautiful
rifle, Stig.</i>

697
00:42:32,714 --> 00:42:34,416
<i>Is that Army issue?</i>

698
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:36,885
You like that? No, it's
Kmart. Blue Light Special.

699
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:39,387
Now answer my question.
Where's your backup?

700
00:42:39,389 --> 00:42:42,124
No, no,
that's a military rifle.

701
00:42:42,126 --> 00:42:44,526
<i>What's the military dog
robbing banks, Stig?</i>

702
00:42:46,196 --> 00:42:48,263
Can we just have a straight-up
conversation, Bobby?

703
00:42:48,265 --> 00:42:50,198
I got you dead to rights.

704
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,634
<i>Yeah? So shoot me.</i>

705
00:42:52,835 --> 00:42:54,236
<i>Again.</i>

706
00:42:55,905 --> 00:42:57,139
<i>No?</i>

707
00:42:58,207 --> 00:42:59,608
<i>I'll shoot myself.</i>

708
00:43:06,683 --> 00:43:08,718
Huh. Not bad.

709
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,253
<i>I'm glad you're impressed.</i>

710
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:13,889
Were you testing me to
see if I would shoot first?

711
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:18,594
If I thought you were clean, I might
tell you, but I don't, so I can't.

712
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,897
<i>You're lying. You don't have
it, do you? Where's the money?</i>

713
00:43:21,698 --> 00:43:24,200
<i>Oh, shit.
What?</i>

714
00:43:24,202 --> 00:43:25,635
You're not the only
one I was expecting.

715
00:43:25,637 --> 00:43:27,403
Three very nasty men
just showed up.

716
00:43:27,405 --> 00:43:28,804
If they find you in my
place, they will get ugly.

717
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:30,707
<i>Who are they?</i>

718
00:43:30,709 --> 00:43:31,808
Yesterday I'd have said
they were my family.

719
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:33,443
Today they kinda
wanna kill me.

720
00:43:33,445 --> 00:43:35,244
<i>I understand the feeling.
You know, fuck you.</i>

721
00:43:35,246 --> 00:43:37,280
What do you know about family?
You don't even have people.

722
00:43:37,282 --> 00:43:38,481
No, Bobby,
that's a stupid idea.

723
00:43:38,483 --> 00:43:39,549
They're already
comin' up the stairs.

724
00:43:39,551 --> 00:43:40,650
<i>Bobby!</i>

725
00:43:53,699 --> 00:43:57,667
<i>hang up the speaker and
answer your cell phone, okay?</i>

726
00:43:57,669 --> 00:43:59,736
<i>If you want me
to help you out...</i>

727
00:44:06,211 --> 00:44:07,978
Yeah.

728
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:10,581
<i>I'm gonna guide
you out from there.</i>

729
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:13,284
<i>Wait.</i>

730
00:44:14,453 --> 00:44:15,520
<i>Wait.</i>

731
00:44:21,626 --> 00:44:23,994
He's comin' up your rear. You
better dart across the hall.

732
00:44:23,996 --> 00:44:25,762
Go over to the bedroom
and hide behind the lockers.

733
00:44:25,764 --> 00:44:26,863
<i>Go.</i>

734
00:44:32,771 --> 00:44:35,440
All right, Bobby, you're gonna
wanna scoot across the hall. Go.

735
00:44:46,418 --> 00:44:47,552
<i>Bobby, Bob...</i>

736
00:44:59,966 --> 00:45:01,400
Shit.

737
00:45:10,945 --> 00:45:12,578
Teemo!
Rooftop!

738
00:45:18,385 --> 00:45:19,518
Target's on the move!

739
00:45:26,794 --> 00:45:27,861
Sorry, Teemo.

740
00:46:15,577 --> 00:46:17,345
Where's our money?

741
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,816
I have no idea what
you're talkin' about.

742
00:46:21,818 --> 00:46:24,819
You think DEA can just
waltz into our bank,

743
00:46:24,821 --> 00:46:26,954
steal our money,
and we're not gonna kick?

744
00:46:28,657 --> 00:46:32,393
Your man Bobby Trench stole
43 million of our dollars.

745
00:46:32,395 --> 00:46:34,428
We'd like it back.

746
00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:36,465
Because it's our money.

747
00:46:36,467 --> 00:46:39,634
Because it's a blatant
act of disrespect.

748
00:46:39,636 --> 00:46:41,470
And because
it's our money.

749
00:46:49,678 --> 00:46:50,979
Please tell me
it's you, Bobby.

750
00:46:50,981 --> 00:46:53,548
Anything new on Stig?

751
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:56,051
He's comin' up clean on every
database I'm cleared for.

752
00:46:56,053 --> 00:46:58,620
No military connection?
No record of service?

753
00:46:58,622 --> 00:47:01,156
To go deeper, I'd need to
get clearance from Jessup.

754
00:47:01,158 --> 00:47:04,627
Well, try your old
contacts in the military.

755
00:47:04,629 --> 00:47:06,529
I'm gonna tell Jessup
everything I know.

756
00:47:06,531 --> 00:47:10,399
<i>Someone has to know whose
money was in the bank.</i>

757
00:47:10,401 --> 00:47:11,833
Yeah. Stig.

758
00:47:11,835 --> 00:47:13,635
Stig didn't even
know I was DEA.

759
00:47:13,637 --> 00:47:16,104
Besides, somebody
tried to kill him, too.

760
00:47:16,106 --> 00:47:18,006
Bobby, let me help you.
What do you need?

761
00:47:18,008 --> 00:47:19,575
Take it easy. Bye.

762
00:47:19,577 --> 00:47:20,877
Bobby.

763
00:47:21,178 --> 00:47:22,044
Fuck!

764
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:46,736
That's how you take down
a man. Now shut the door.

765
00:47:55,946 --> 00:47:57,680
Just let it come.

766
00:48:03,788 --> 00:48:06,657
Agent Robert
Lynn Trench.

767
00:48:06,659 --> 00:48:10,761
A.k. a. Bobby T, a. k. a.
Bobby B, a. k. a. Bobby Beans.

768
00:48:14,833 --> 00:48:16,501
Let's have a chat.

769
00:48:36,155 --> 00:48:40,258
You stole $43.125 million

770
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:42,559
that did not belong to you.

771
00:48:43,495 --> 00:48:45,129
Now, man-to-man,

772
00:48:47,032 --> 00:48:50,201
who at DEA authorized
you to rob our bank?

773
00:48:52,238 --> 00:48:53,805
You a banker?

774
00:48:57,009 --> 00:48:59,111
You ever play
Russian roulette?

775
00:49:01,815 --> 00:49:03,148
Thing is,

776
00:49:05,584 --> 00:49:08,119
most people put the gun
to the temple.

777
00:49:09,555 --> 00:49:11,089
Well, that's just stupid.

778
00:49:17,197 --> 00:49:19,298
You blow a man's head off
'fore he's had a chance

779
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:21,567
to tell you
what you wanna know.

780
00:49:22,202 --> 00:49:24,169
Mess up your suit, too.

781
00:49:42,290 --> 00:49:44,324
Who told you it was all
right to take our money?

782
00:49:45,827 --> 00:49:47,727
"Our money. Our bank. "

783
00:49:50,097 --> 00:49:51,831
Who are ya?

784
00:49:51,833 --> 00:49:54,934
If you don't
know who I am,

785
00:49:54,936 --> 00:49:57,270
how did you know to
steal our 43 million?

786
00:49:57,272 --> 00:49:59,172
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

787
00:49:59,174 --> 00:50:00,874
You don't?
No.

788
00:50:01,275 --> 00:50:02,342
Well...

789
00:50:04,111 --> 00:50:05,278
Where's the money?

790
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,846
Oh, boy.

791
00:50:07,748 --> 00:50:09,149
Well, uh...

792
00:50:11,153 --> 00:50:13,187
It ain't down there,
I can guarantee you that.

793
00:50:24,967 --> 00:50:26,267
Whoo-hoo.

794
00:50:27,369 --> 00:50:28,970
A.k. a. Bobby Balls.

795
00:50:28,972 --> 00:50:30,304
Clean and shaven.

796
00:50:41,717 --> 00:50:43,250
You know what you are?

797
00:50:46,288 --> 00:50:47,388
You

798
00:50:48,757 --> 00:50:50,925
are a dirty DEA agent.

799
00:50:51,627 --> 00:50:53,395
That's right.

800
00:50:53,397 --> 00:50:57,232
You're a dirty DEA agent
who robbed a bank.

801
00:50:57,234 --> 00:50:58,700
And shot your boss.

802
00:51:12,782 --> 00:51:15,851
You walk into
any federal office,

803
00:51:15,853 --> 00:51:17,419
and that's the story
they're gonna have.

804
00:51:21,725 --> 00:51:26,663
Unless you bring me
$43.125 million,

805
00:51:28,698 --> 00:51:31,199
and you walk away.
Clean.

806
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:36,873
Have I properly
incentivized you?

807
00:51:37,875 --> 00:51:40,176
More than you know.

808
00:51:40,178 --> 00:51:43,212
Unless you wanna rot in
jail, you best get after it.

809
00:51:47,818 --> 00:51:50,187
Go on, now. Go on.

810
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:00,763
All right.

811
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:08,038
You're thinkin'
he deserved better?

812
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:09,707
You're right.

813
00:52:33,299 --> 00:52:34,766
Hey, Rudy.

814
00:52:35,234 --> 00:52:36,501
<i>Hola, Javier.</i>

815
00:52:45,844 --> 00:52:47,177
Morning, Papi.

816
00:52:47,179 --> 00:52:48,346
Don't move.

817
00:52:48,348 --> 00:52:49,814
Go inside, quick.

818
00:52:49,816 --> 00:52:51,216
Mommy!

819
00:52:51,218 --> 00:52:52,350
Whose money
did we steal?

820
00:52:52,352 --> 00:52:53,518
You really wanna know?

821
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,086
I really wanna know.

822
00:53:02,394 --> 00:53:04,996
Easy, old man, get in
there. Get in there.

823
00:53:04,998 --> 00:53:05,864
Payback's a bitch!

824
00:53:07,833 --> 00:53:09,100
Payback's a bitch!

825
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:10,969
Uh, uh, uh.

826
00:53:10,971 --> 00:53:12,303
Whoa, Bobby.
Drop the gun. Give me the keys.

827
00:53:12,305 --> 00:53:13,838
Give me the keys.
Nice and easy.

828
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,106
I can't do that.

829
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:17,143
Why not? Well, I got
him first. I got dibs.

830
00:53:17,145 --> 00:53:19,512
I got a. 44. I'm taking
Papi. Give me the keys.

831
00:53:19,514 --> 00:53:22,114
You want 'em?
Come get 'em.

832
00:53:22,116 --> 00:53:25,518
You're thinkin' a little
blindfold, maybe use your teeth.

833
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:27,452
That's not what I'm thinkin'.
You know what I'm thinkin'?

834
00:53:28,454 --> 00:53:30,456
Oh, shit, man.
How's that?

835
00:53:30,458 --> 00:53:32,424
That was uncalled for.

836
00:53:32,426 --> 00:53:34,493
Shit. I liked you better when
you were "I-know-a-guy" Bobby.

837
00:53:34,495 --> 00:53:36,328
That Bobby was a good guy.

838
00:53:36,330 --> 00:53:38,430
Well, I liked you better when
you were winkin' at waitresses

839
00:53:38,432 --> 00:53:40,132
and shootin' the heads off of chickens.

840
00:53:40,134 --> 00:53:42,168
Give me the keys.
Give me the keys.

841
00:53:43,271 --> 00:53:45,472
Shit!
What's going on?

842
00:53:45,474 --> 00:53:47,474
You saw that move comin'?
That's correct. Give me the keys.

843
00:53:47,476 --> 00:53:49,442
Damn, you're good.

844
00:53:49,444 --> 00:53:51,811
Now, one of us is gonna
have to pick up those keys.

845
00:53:51,813 --> 00:53:54,513
Guess. All right. I'll
get 'em, all right?

846
00:53:54,515 --> 00:53:55,381
Get 'em, get 'em. Put
that musket away, man.

847
00:54:24,045 --> 00:54:26,012
Hey, pull over!
Pull over?

848
00:54:26,014 --> 00:54:27,882
Hey, Papi,
you like my drivin'?

849
00:54:35,490 --> 00:54:36,591
Oh, shit!

850
00:54:40,995 --> 00:54:43,130
Come on, Bobby,
I ain't got all damn day!

851
00:55:30,513 --> 00:55:31,580
What do you wanna do?

852
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:51,600
Ow!

853
00:56:07,953 --> 00:56:09,620
All right. All right, all
right. All right, let me go.

854
00:56:09,622 --> 00:56:10,688
You let me go first.

855
00:56:10,690 --> 00:56:12,055
No, you let me go.

856
00:56:12,057 --> 00:56:13,589
On three.
On three.

857
00:56:13,591 --> 00:56:16,659
One. Two. Three.

858
00:56:16,661 --> 00:56:19,295
See? Now you're making me
not be able to trust you.

859
00:56:19,297 --> 00:56:20,997
On the count of three,
we'll let each other go.

860
00:56:20,999 --> 00:56:22,099
All right?
All right. That's fair.

861
00:56:22,101 --> 00:56:23,500
One. Two.

862
00:56:23,502 --> 00:56:24,568
Three.

863
00:56:25,337 --> 00:56:26,704
I knew it.
Let me go.

864
00:56:26,706 --> 00:56:29,139
No! I'm gonna let you
go. I'm gonna let you go.

865
00:56:29,141 --> 00:56:30,307
All right.
One...

866
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:35,712
Ow!

867
00:56:36,381 --> 00:56:38,282
Ow!

868
00:56:38,284 --> 00:56:41,018
Come on, man. You gotta admit,
that was kind of fun, no?

869
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:43,620
You didn't like that?

870
00:56:43,622 --> 00:56:45,155
Who are you?

871
00:56:45,157 --> 00:56:46,323
Shit.

872
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:50,495
U.S. Navy Intel.
Yeah?

873
00:56:50,497 --> 00:56:52,130
Or I was.

874
00:56:52,132 --> 00:56:54,466
My commander
FUBARed my jacket.

875
00:56:54,468 --> 00:56:56,534
And now I'm AWOL
after stabbing an MP.

876
00:56:56,536 --> 00:57:00,371
You're lucky. They got me
framed for killing my boss.

877
00:57:00,373 --> 00:57:02,473
Did your boss order your four
closest friends to kill you?

878
00:57:03,742 --> 00:57:06,011
No, you got me there.

879
00:57:10,116 --> 00:57:13,051
DEA Officer Bobby Trench, but
I guess you know that already.

880
00:57:13,053 --> 00:57:14,219
Pleasure.

881
00:57:14,221 --> 00:57:16,588
So, what, you just happened to pick me,

882
00:57:16,590 --> 00:57:18,690
or you got orders to
set me up on purpose?

883
00:57:18,692 --> 00:57:20,626
I had orders, man. I
didn't know you were DEA.

884
00:57:20,628 --> 00:57:22,028
My people did.
But they're Intel.

885
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:23,028
There's not much
they don't know.

886
00:57:23,030 --> 00:57:24,462
Your people?

887
00:57:24,464 --> 00:57:28,099
so I can take it over my
commander's head to the Admiral.

888
00:57:28,101 --> 00:57:29,701
That's why they wanna kill me
and why I wanted to talk to Papi.

889
00:57:30,669 --> 00:57:31,636
Right.

890
00:57:32,304 --> 00:57:34,507
Well...

891
00:57:34,509 --> 00:57:38,377
I guess we can both talk
to him at the same time.

892
00:57:38,379 --> 00:57:39,578
What, like we're
workin' together?

893
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:40,813
No, not like we're
working together.

894
00:57:40,815 --> 00:57:43,682
No, like we're workin'
in the same vicinity.

895
00:57:43,684 --> 00:57:45,718
Together.
In the same area code.

896
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:47,486
Together.
The same county.

897
00:57:47,488 --> 00:57:49,588
<i>And don't get all We Are
The World on me either.</i>

898
00:57:49,590 --> 00:57:52,391
When this is over, I'm still gonna
shoot you. But we're partners.

899
00:57:52,393 --> 00:57:54,060
<i>Come on, man,
Ebony and Ivory.</i>

900
00:57:54,062 --> 00:57:55,795
Shit, I think he puked.
He's puked or he's dead.

901
00:57:57,297 --> 00:57:58,564
Oh, yeah, he puked.

902
00:57:59,132 --> 00:58:00,266
Hey.

903
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:04,704
I'm gonna
fuckin' kill you both.

904
00:58:04,706 --> 00:58:06,239
This might take a while.

905
00:58:06,241 --> 00:58:07,741
I got all day, partner.

906
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:10,609
Let me put that in there
with ya. Put that on ya.

907
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:20,187
So, partner,
how you wanna do this?

908
00:58:20,189 --> 00:58:22,089
I like that, it's got a nice
roll off your tongue there.

909
00:58:22,091 --> 00:58:25,392
We're not that close. Don't
kumbaya with me. Don't kumbaya.

910
00:58:25,394 --> 00:58:28,528
I'm gonna get my bucket and
towel and waterboard his ass.

911
00:58:28,530 --> 00:58:31,132
No, we gotta give him a chance
to talk. You got anything to say?

912
00:58:31,134 --> 00:58:33,267
I hope you guys like
the taste of balls,

913
00:58:33,269 --> 00:58:36,570
because I'm gonna chop yours
off, stuff 'em in your mouths.

914
00:58:36,572 --> 00:58:38,305
See?

915
00:58:38,307 --> 00:58:41,575
Or maybe I'll put yours
in his and his in yours.

916
00:58:41,577 --> 00:58:42,642
Want me to get
the bucket?

917
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:43,643
Kumbaya.

918
00:58:45,614 --> 00:58:49,550
So why were you puttin' so
much money in Tres Cruces?

919
00:58:49,552 --> 00:58:51,719
<i>It's Tres Cruces.</i>

920
00:58:51,721 --> 00:58:54,422
We thought you just
stashed a little cash there

921
00:58:54,424 --> 00:58:57,391
until we robbed the place,
found 40 million. Why is that?

922
00:58:57,393 --> 00:58:58,558
<i>You robbed Tres Cruces?</i>

923
00:58:58,560 --> 00:58:59,794
That's correct.
Why is that?

924
00:59:03,298 --> 00:59:04,532
That's funny, huh?

925
00:59:04,534 --> 00:59:06,267
You're dead.

926
00:59:06,269 --> 00:59:07,735
Yeah, that is funny,
isn't it? You're both dead.

927
00:59:10,172 --> 00:59:11,906
And I didn't even
have to kill you.

928
00:59:13,376 --> 00:59:15,677
I thought you were sharp.
"I-know-a-guy" Bobby.

929
00:59:16,279 --> 00:59:18,180
But you...

930
00:59:18,182 --> 00:59:19,781
You just
ripped off the CIA.

931
00:59:23,585 --> 00:59:24,919
The CIA?

932
00:59:24,921 --> 00:59:26,821
The CIA.

933
00:59:26,823 --> 00:59:29,291
He's full of crap. Why would he have
money in the same bank as the CIA?

934
00:59:29,293 --> 00:59:31,393
Why would you have money
in the same bank as the CIA?

935
00:59:31,395 --> 00:59:32,928
I don't have shit
in that bank.

936
00:59:32,930 --> 00:59:35,697
<i>The only money I deliver to Tres Cruces</i>

937
00:59:35,699 --> 00:59:38,600
is a payment.
To the CIA?

938
00:59:38,602 --> 00:59:42,572
The CIA. They take 7% of my revenue.

939
00:59:42,574 --> 00:59:45,507
In return, they let me use their planes

940
00:59:45,509 --> 00:59:46,808
so I can get my shit
across the border.

941
00:59:49,345 --> 00:59:52,614
I could do it a lot cheaper, but
there was really no negotiations.

942
00:59:52,616 --> 00:59:54,816
You know...

943
00:59:54,818 --> 00:59:56,786
They take it from
all the cartels.

944
00:59:57,454 --> 00:59:58,955
Bullshit.

945
00:59:58,957 --> 01:00:00,823
Okay.

946
01:00:00,825 --> 01:00:02,325
They're still
gonna kill you.

947
01:00:10,534 --> 01:00:11,734
Bobby?

948
01:00:12,503 --> 01:00:14,837
You said stop by anytime.

949
01:00:14,839 --> 01:00:17,540
You kidnapped a drug
kingpin! That's correct.

950
01:00:17,542 --> 01:00:20,543
Papi Greco! And you
tied him up in my garage!

951
01:00:20,545 --> 01:00:22,545
Sorry. What do you...

952
01:00:26,586 --> 01:00:31,288
Yeah, sure. Please. Help yourself
to anything. Take whatever you want.

953
01:00:31,290 --> 01:00:32,689
It's just a yogurt.

954
01:00:32,691 --> 01:00:33,856
But it's her yogurt.
Just put it back.

955
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:36,459
Please.

956
01:00:37,895 --> 01:00:39,964
Are you two like
ex-boyfriend and girlfriend?

957
01:00:39,966 --> 01:00:42,533
Actually, you know what?
We never put a name on it.

958
01:00:42,535 --> 01:00:44,468
So, what, you broke his
heart or he broke yours?

959
01:00:44,470 --> 01:00:47,438
Wow, this guy will really ask
anyone anything at anytime.

960
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,273
Why don't you go and
check on Papi, huh?

961
01:00:49,275 --> 01:00:51,242
What do you see
in this guy?

962
01:00:51,244 --> 01:00:53,745
I could go on for hours,
but I don't know you,

963
01:00:53,747 --> 01:00:55,447
and I don't think
this is the right time

964
01:00:55,449 --> 01:00:56,914
for us to have this
conversation, okay?

965
01:00:56,916 --> 01:00:58,716
So daddy issues, huh?

966
01:00:58,718 --> 01:00:59,850
Daddy!

967
01:01:00,352 --> 01:01:03,587
Garage. Papi. Go.

968
01:01:03,589 --> 01:01:05,389
I get it now.
Go. Go to the garage.

969
01:01:05,391 --> 01:01:08,260
Can I have the yogurt? You
can have the yogurt. Here.

970
01:01:08,262 --> 01:01:09,861
I don't like her, man.
You don't get a vote.

971
01:01:09,863 --> 01:01:11,630
I'm gonna watch her.

972
01:01:11,632 --> 01:01:14,366
Bobby.
What are you doing?

973
01:01:15,901 --> 01:01:18,570
Are you 100% sure
you can trust this guy?

974
01:01:18,572 --> 01:01:20,437
No. But he's all
the help I got.

975
01:01:21,373 --> 01:01:23,708
Jessup's dead.

976
01:01:23,710 --> 01:01:28,046
The money we stole was CIA
money. They came lookin' for it.

977
01:01:28,048 --> 01:01:30,915
I'm sorry, Deb, I didn't mean
to get you involved in all this.

978
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:35,854
You okay?

979
01:01:40,861 --> 01:01:42,361
What are you
smirking at?

980
01:01:44,630 --> 01:01:46,731
You know, I've been
racking my brain

981
01:01:46,733 --> 01:01:48,500
trying to figure out
who you look like.

982
01:01:48,502 --> 01:01:50,335
And it
finally dawned on me.

983
01:01:50,337 --> 01:01:52,938
You look like a Mexican Albert Einstein.

984
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:54,940
Minus the genius factor,
obviously.

985
01:01:54,942 --> 01:01:56,375
You want some yogurt?

986
01:01:57,344 --> 01:01:58,544
Payback's a bitch.

987
01:02:01,315 --> 01:02:02,515
That's for Little Toro.

988
01:02:44,025 --> 01:02:45,092
Stig.

989
01:02:55,770 --> 01:02:56,870
Pack it up!

990
01:02:56,872 --> 01:02:57,971
Move it, move it!

991
01:02:59,807 --> 01:03:01,708
Stig.
The one and only.

992
01:03:01,710 --> 01:03:02,777
That your people?

993
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:04,145
Do you have to
say it like that?

994
01:03:04,147 --> 01:03:06,047
Like what? They're your people, right?

995
01:03:06,049 --> 01:03:08,683
Technically, yes, but I
thought you were my people now.

996
01:03:08,685 --> 01:03:10,585
All right, two taps, we'll
hit the garage. On go.

997
01:03:10,587 --> 01:03:12,153
Okay. On your go.
Go!

998
01:03:38,415 --> 01:03:39,548
Fuck.

999
01:03:41,718 --> 01:03:42,717
What was that about?

1000
01:03:42,719 --> 01:03:44,051
That was messed up.

1001
01:03:44,053 --> 01:03:45,187
What the hell
is going on?

1002
01:03:45,189 --> 01:03:46,188
I don't know.

1003
01:03:47,724 --> 01:03:48,957
I don't know.

1004
01:03:51,628 --> 01:03:52,928
Give me your phone, now.

1005
01:03:54,998 --> 01:03:58,133
I'll take the car, too.
Get out. Get out!

1006
01:03:58,135 --> 01:03:59,035
Oh, my God.

1007
01:04:12,982 --> 01:04:14,984
<i>Está en ungray Charger.</i>

1008
01:04:20,124 --> 01:04:22,025
How did Stig's people know
to come to your house?

1009
01:04:24,128 --> 01:04:26,563
I don't know.
They must have followed you.

1010
01:04:26,565 --> 01:04:27,698
I don't think so.

1011
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:29,033
We would have seen 'em.

1012
01:04:29,035 --> 01:04:30,099
We should have seen 'em.

1013
01:04:31,035 --> 01:04:33,102
How'd they know to
come to your house?

1014
01:04:33,471 --> 01:04:34,604
Hmm?

1015
01:04:41,078 --> 01:04:42,746
Why were they
at your house, Debbie?

1016
01:04:42,748 --> 01:04:43,948
No. You serious?

1017
01:04:46,485 --> 01:04:47,332
Bobby...

1018
01:05:26,259 --> 01:05:27,959
<i>Out of the car,
gabacho.</i>

1019
01:05:27,961 --> 01:05:29,594
Hurry up.

1020
01:05:29,596 --> 01:05:31,062
<i>You fucked up now, ese.</i>

1021
01:05:31,697 --> 01:05:32,998
On your knees.

1022
01:05:42,174 --> 01:05:44,142
I know some guys,
too, Bobby.

1023
01:05:46,879 --> 01:05:48,980
Bag 'em up.
Let's take 'em home.

1024
01:05:54,955 --> 01:05:56,756
Do you wanna talk about it? No.

1025
01:05:56,758 --> 01:05:58,090
You sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.

1026
01:05:59,293 --> 01:06:00,192
I told you I didn't
like her, man.

1027
01:06:00,194 --> 01:06:01,961
Shut up.

1028
01:06:01,963 --> 01:06:03,029
What are you
gettin' mad at me for?

1029
01:06:03,031 --> 01:06:04,563
Because you
talk too much.

1030
01:06:04,565 --> 01:06:05,630
What'd I ever
do to you?

1031
01:06:05,632 --> 01:06:08,000
Besides shoot me?

1032
01:06:08,002 --> 01:06:09,335
You know what you are?
You're a misanthorpe.

1033
01:06:09,337 --> 01:06:11,003
It's misanthrope.
I'm a misanthrope.

1034
01:06:11,005 --> 01:06:13,239
Did you know what
I meant to say?

1035
01:06:13,241 --> 01:06:15,007
No. What did you
mean to say?

1036
01:06:15,009 --> 01:06:17,043
That you don't like people. Shut up.

1037
01:06:24,153 --> 01:06:25,652
Time for my massage.

1038
01:06:25,654 --> 01:06:28,688
Yeah. I'll have housekeeping
clean up your bed.

1039
01:06:33,594 --> 01:06:36,797
Oh, shit.

1040
01:06:36,799 --> 01:06:40,934
My grandfather cut cane for 30 years
every day and never got a blister.

1041
01:06:42,171 --> 01:06:44,204
Says it smells like hell,

1042
01:06:44,772 --> 01:06:46,273
toughens the hands.

1043
01:06:47,308 --> 01:06:49,610
You know what
I like about this?

1044
01:06:49,612 --> 01:06:52,713
Not only do I get to take
my time with you guys,

1045
01:06:52,715 --> 01:06:56,683
but this time, I don't have to
worry about leaving any marks.

1046
01:06:56,685 --> 01:06:58,352
Don't put your
hands on me, man.

1047
01:06:59,788 --> 01:07:01,955
Shit.
What did you say?

1048
01:07:01,957 --> 01:07:04,224
Just don't put those
pissy hands on me, man.

1049
01:07:07,763 --> 01:07:09,297
You ain't
got a home, Bobby.

1050
01:07:09,299 --> 01:07:11,866
DEA doesn't
want you around.

1051
01:07:11,868 --> 01:07:12,900
Not with your sins.

1052
01:07:15,137 --> 01:07:16,303
Payback's a bitch.

1053
01:07:16,305 --> 01:07:18,338
You smell like
warm Corona, man.

1054
01:07:24,113 --> 01:07:28,116
You remember
my prize breeding bull.

1055
01:07:28,118 --> 01:07:31,219
<i>With cojones
the size of coconuts.</i>

1056
01:07:31,221 --> 01:07:32,920
You wanna see him?

1057
01:07:32,922 --> 01:07:34,390
No, it's okay.
We can see good from here.

1058
01:07:34,392 --> 01:07:35,858
<i>Adiós, Bobby.</i>

1059
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:36,992
No, no.

1060
01:07:45,701 --> 01:07:46,801
Shit!

1061
01:07:50,006 --> 01:07:51,206
$43 million!

1062
01:07:52,275 --> 01:07:54,009
It's everything
we stole from the CIA.

1063
01:07:54,011 --> 01:07:55,744
You let us go,
we'll bring it to you.

1064
01:07:58,381 --> 01:07:59,848
I got the money.

1065
01:07:59,850 --> 01:08:01,450
What are you talking about? I got it.

1066
01:08:01,452 --> 01:08:03,419
You don't have it! I know I don't
have it. He doesn't know that.

1067
01:08:03,421 --> 01:08:04,820
But you don't
have the money.

1068
01:08:04,822 --> 01:08:06,288
I know you don't have it,
'cause I have it.

1069
01:08:06,290 --> 01:08:07,423
You have it?
Well, where is it?

1070
01:08:07,425 --> 01:08:10,325
Corpus Christi Naval Air
Station. Don't tell me. Tell him.

1071
01:08:11,796 --> 01:08:12,928
Oh, shit!

1072
01:08:12,930 --> 01:08:15,764
Where is it?

1073
01:08:15,766 --> 01:08:17,867
Commander Quince's safe! Corpus
Christi Naval Air Station!

1074
01:08:20,205 --> 01:08:22,739
The guy's pissing on us, and you're
askin' if we should fuckin' tell him.

1075
01:08:22,741 --> 01:08:25,475
If that's the truth, I might
as well just kill you now.

1076
01:08:40,392 --> 01:08:43,293
I had a run-in with a couple
boys out of your organization.

1077
01:08:43,728 --> 01:08:44,795
Hello, Earl.

1078
01:08:46,064 --> 01:08:50,300
Mr. Bobby Beans
and Mr. Michael Stigman.

1079
01:08:50,302 --> 01:08:53,737
Well, they're not
from my organization.

1080
01:08:53,739 --> 01:08:55,505
They're freelancers.

1081
01:08:55,507 --> 01:08:58,942
And Bobby Beans
is undercover DEA.

1082
01:08:58,944 --> 01:09:01,245
And Mr. Stigman's
AWOL U.S. Navy.

1083
01:09:03,248 --> 01:09:06,984
They stole 43.125 million
from the Tres Cruces.

1084
01:09:06,986 --> 01:09:08,452
We want it back.

1085
01:09:08,454 --> 01:09:10,121
Is there a finder's fee?

1086
01:09:10,123 --> 01:09:11,922
Fee is we let you
continue to do business.

1087
01:09:11,924 --> 01:09:14,959
Fee is we don't raise
our cut from 7% to 20.

1088
01:09:14,961 --> 01:09:19,096
The fee is we don't come down here
with a squad of Apache A-6 helicopters

1089
01:09:19,098 --> 01:09:21,265
and wipe you off
the face of the earth.

1090
01:09:21,267 --> 01:09:25,236
You like my country weak
and corrupt, don't you?

1091
01:09:25,238 --> 01:09:27,438
So you can buy your
cheap crap at the mall.

1092
01:09:29,342 --> 01:09:31,209
Well, Earl,
I'm not cheap.

1093
01:09:32,145 --> 01:09:34,312
Is this about
pride, Manny?

1094
01:09:35,148 --> 01:09:36,882
About machismo?

1095
01:09:36,884 --> 01:09:38,983
Prove you got
a big Mexican cock?

1096
01:09:40,385 --> 01:09:42,287
Well, your cock is huge.
It's massive.

1097
01:09:42,289 --> 01:09:45,791
And I,
I'm in awe of your cock.

1098
01:09:45,793 --> 01:09:48,960
So what? You're still a drug dealer.

1099
01:09:48,962 --> 01:09:51,263
And I'm still the government
of the United States.

1100
01:09:53,199 --> 01:09:54,833
It's a free market,
Manny.

1101
01:09:55,568 --> 01:09:57,136
Not a free world.

1102
01:09:59,306 --> 01:10:00,373
I'll take a look.

1103
01:10:00,375 --> 01:10:03,074
Hard!
You'll look hard.

1104
01:10:03,076 --> 01:10:04,342
Under every rock in Mexico.

1105
01:10:08,281 --> 01:10:10,248
Let's get out
of this shithole.

1106
01:10:33,407 --> 01:10:37,210
I've decided to let you
bring me the 43 million.

1107
01:10:37,212 --> 01:10:38,611
The truck'll take you
north to the border.

1108
01:10:38,613 --> 01:10:41,849
<i>From there, you'll cross
on foot with the coyotes.</i>

1109
01:10:41,851 --> 01:10:43,250
If it's all the same,
we'd rather drive.

1110
01:10:43,252 --> 01:10:45,285
With everybody
lookin' for you,

1111
01:10:45,287 --> 01:10:46,486
they'd pull you out
of line in two seconds.

1112
01:10:46,488 --> 01:10:48,121
No, you go the way
you force my people.

1113
01:10:48,123 --> 01:10:49,522
If we can't
risk crossing,

1114
01:10:49,524 --> 01:10:52,859
I'll meet you north
of the border in 24 hours.

1115
01:10:54,129 --> 01:10:59,900
Now, I'm trusting you to
fulfill your part of the bargain.

1116
01:11:10,413 --> 01:11:12,180
Hey, Bobby.

1117
01:11:12,182 --> 01:11:15,082
You got 24 hours
to bring me the money.

1118
01:11:15,084 --> 01:11:16,617
Or I'm gonna shoot her
right in the head.

1119
01:11:18,086 --> 01:11:20,020
Then I'm gonna find you,

1120
01:11:20,022 --> 01:11:22,223
and I'm gonna
gut you like a pig!

1121
01:12:26,122 --> 01:12:27,222
Stig!

1122
01:12:57,621 --> 01:12:59,456
When this is over,
I'm still gonna shoot you.

1123
01:13:00,691 --> 01:13:02,526
Whatever it takes, Bobby.

1124
01:13:12,536 --> 01:13:13,703
Pick one.
I can get in anything.

1125
01:13:13,705 --> 01:13:18,009
No, I don't do German, okay?
Locks are tricky, too many alarms.

1126
01:13:18,011 --> 01:13:19,677
Okay. Suburban?

1127
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:23,381
It's gonna get like two miles a
gallon. I ain't payin' for all that gas.

1128
01:13:23,383 --> 01:13:25,349
For a car thief, you
are mighty particular.

1129
01:13:25,351 --> 01:13:26,684
I'll break
into the Honda.

1130
01:13:26,686 --> 01:13:27,785
I look like I'm gonna ride
in that Honda to you?

1131
01:13:27,787 --> 01:13:29,620
You could.

1132
01:13:29,622 --> 01:13:30,789
And you could pick somethin'
with a little more class.

1133
01:13:30,791 --> 01:13:32,357
I hate to remind you,
but we're breakin'

1134
01:13:32,359 --> 01:13:33,658
onto a high-security
Navy base.

1135
01:13:33,660 --> 01:13:36,594
<i>It ain't no Les
MisÃ©rables for you tonight.</i>

1136
01:13:36,596 --> 01:13:38,629
Oh, man,
whatever the fuck, man.

1137
01:13:38,631 --> 01:13:43,601
Look, it's not my fault Quince
took the money back to the base.

1138
01:13:43,603 --> 01:13:45,203
I thought you said you took
the money back to the base.

1139
01:13:45,205 --> 01:13:46,705
No, I never said that.

1140
01:13:46,707 --> 01:13:48,173
So the money
could be anywhere.

1141
01:13:48,175 --> 01:13:50,075
It could be in East Jabip,
the Cayman Islands...

1142
01:13:50,077 --> 01:13:51,576
No, the money
is on the base, okay?

1143
01:13:51,578 --> 01:13:53,412
I gave it to Commander
Quince at the Camino Real,

1144
01:13:53,414 --> 01:13:57,582
Right before he took you
out and tried to kill you.

1145
01:13:57,584 --> 01:13:59,618
That doesn't mean
he's lyin' about the base.

1146
01:13:59,620 --> 01:14:02,754
Not everybody's as paranoid
as you, Bobby. Jeez.

1147
01:14:02,756 --> 01:14:04,790
What about the Prius?
You like the Prius?

1148
01:14:06,092 --> 01:14:07,325
Camino Real.

1149
01:14:07,327 --> 01:14:08,427
Yeah, it's a hotel.

1150
01:14:09,395 --> 01:14:10,695
I met Debbie
at the Camino Real.

1151
01:14:10,697 --> 01:14:12,064
No shit?

1152
01:14:12,066 --> 01:14:15,668
She said she was there to
meet her boyfriend, Harvey.

1153
01:14:15,670 --> 01:14:17,437
Wait. Your girlfriend
has a boyfriend?

1154
01:14:17,439 --> 01:14:18,638
She's not my girlfriend.

1155
01:14:19,773 --> 01:14:20,673
Holy shit.

1156
01:14:22,575 --> 01:14:23,642
Yeah, just pick a car.

1157
01:14:24,444 --> 01:14:25,544
Right here.

1158
01:14:26,512 --> 01:14:27,612
You picked that one?

1159
01:14:27,614 --> 01:14:29,482
Yeah.

1160
01:14:29,484 --> 01:14:31,084
Fuck you want,
a fuckin' Bentley?

1161
01:14:31,418 --> 01:14:32,685
I got it.

1162
01:14:50,270 --> 01:14:51,571
Hi.
Hey.

1163
01:14:52,739 --> 01:14:54,607
Crazy question,

1164
01:14:54,609 --> 01:14:57,211
you wouldn't have anybody
knows how to fix a snowmobile?

1165
01:14:57,213 --> 01:15:00,747
Would you check for me? I
really need it fixed by tonight.

1166
01:15:00,749 --> 01:15:02,382
Why, a big storm coming?

1167
01:15:02,384 --> 01:15:04,251
You never can be too sure.

1168
01:15:05,286 --> 01:15:06,553
I'll be right back.

1169
01:15:08,423 --> 01:15:09,889
Up with that?
What?

1170
01:15:09,891 --> 01:15:12,292
She smiled at you,
you didn't wink at her?

1171
01:15:12,294 --> 01:15:14,495
I don't wink
at every woman I see.

1172
01:15:14,497 --> 01:15:18,132
Snowmobile in Texas, huh? You must
be in some serious shit, sailor.

1173
01:15:18,134 --> 01:15:19,633
You got yourself
a new claw, huh?

1174
01:15:19,635 --> 01:15:21,602
Gimme claw. Give it
a pound. It's a beaut.

1175
01:15:21,604 --> 01:15:23,537
You still got
my rainy-day stash?

1176
01:15:23,539 --> 01:15:24,705
Yeah.

1177
01:15:28,644 --> 01:15:30,145
See ya later, Stig.

1178
01:15:30,147 --> 01:15:31,312
All right.

1179
01:15:34,616 --> 01:15:37,684
You know what they say, talk softly
and carry an M-4 with a grenade launcher.

1180
01:15:37,686 --> 01:15:38,785
Wow.

1181
01:15:40,256 --> 01:15:41,823
Which one you want?

1182
01:15:41,825 --> 01:15:43,558
This one.

1183
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:45,260
What's your plan
for gettin' on the base?

1184
01:15:45,262 --> 01:15:46,361
I'm workin' on it.

1185
01:16:00,943 --> 01:16:03,211
Remember, once we get
to the command building,

1186
01:16:03,213 --> 01:16:06,848
If he's not in the field, that's
where he lives 18 hours a day.

1187
01:16:06,850 --> 01:16:08,417
Right, right. But you
still haven't told me

1188
01:16:08,419 --> 01:16:10,252
what the plan is to
get through the gate.

1189
01:16:10,254 --> 01:16:12,688
I got a plan. I mean, I'm
capable of comin' up with a plan.

1190
01:16:12,690 --> 01:16:15,291
I'm just sayin' you
haven't told me. What is it?

1191
01:16:15,293 --> 01:16:16,759
I'm workin' on it.

1192
01:16:17,862 --> 01:16:18,928
Better work faster.

1193
01:16:25,235 --> 01:16:26,368
Much faster.

1194
01:16:28,705 --> 01:16:30,573
Move it up.
Quickly.

1195
01:16:30,575 --> 01:16:31,640
Fuck it.

1196
01:16:31,908 --> 01:16:33,309
Halt!

1197
01:16:33,311 --> 01:16:34,743
He's going through!

1198
01:16:35,612 --> 01:16:36,913
That fast enough for ya?

1199
01:16:40,318 --> 01:16:41,384
Shit!

1200
01:16:43,688 --> 01:16:45,588
Let's go! Let's go!
On the radio now!

1201
01:16:45,590 --> 01:16:46,855
Return to post!

1202
01:16:54,398 --> 01:16:55,532
That was your plan?

1203
01:16:55,534 --> 01:16:59,703
That's not a plan. Nobody in their
right mind breaks into a naval base.

1204
01:16:59,705 --> 01:17:01,438
That's why it's a brilliant
plan. No one expected it.

1205
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:04,507
You shoulda seen your face.
Damn, they were surprised.

1206
01:17:04,509 --> 01:17:05,943
Your stop comin' up.
I'll play decoy,

1207
01:17:05,945 --> 01:17:07,744
lead 'em away, try to
get to the Admiral, okay?

1208
01:17:07,746 --> 01:17:10,547
All right. Things go wrong, I'll
see you back at the boat yard.

1209
01:17:10,549 --> 01:17:14,784
I'm gettin' a medal. I get to the
Admiral, I'm gettin' a medal. Watch.

1210
01:17:16,887 --> 01:17:18,688
You're gonna wish
me luck, aren't ya?

1211
01:17:18,690 --> 01:17:20,024
Come on, man, let's hear it! Good luck.

1212
01:17:20,026 --> 01:17:21,792
Quince's office
at the end of the hall.

1213
01:17:21,794 --> 01:17:23,794
Remember, first floor,
end of the hall!

1214
01:17:34,806 --> 01:17:36,607
Halt!
Stop where you are!

1215
01:17:37,609 --> 01:17:39,477
We have a breach
at Status Hall!

1216
01:17:41,747 --> 01:17:42,947
Up the stairs!

1217
01:17:45,450 --> 01:17:48,320
Sir, Petty Officer Michael
Stigman, ID number 540333.

1218
01:17:49,622 --> 01:17:51,423
Wait a minute,
what's the problem?

1219
01:17:51,425 --> 01:17:53,058
Shit, I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to do that to you, man.

1220
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:55,726
Sir.

1221
01:17:55,728 --> 01:17:58,863
I've never stepped foot in an officers'
mess, much less crashed it.

1222
01:17:58,865 --> 01:18:00,431
Please, sir,
it's an emergency.

1223
01:18:01,033 --> 01:18:02,601
Stand outside, please.

1224
01:18:04,737 --> 01:18:06,938
Leave us alone.
Thank you, sir.

1225
01:18:06,940 --> 01:18:10,642
I didn't mean to hit you like that.
I apologize.

1226
01:18:10,644 --> 01:18:12,811
I'm listening,
sailor. Sit.

1227
01:18:12,813 --> 01:18:13,912
Thank you, sir.

1228
01:18:19,085 --> 01:18:20,886
Try the Admiral again for me.
Yes, sir.

1229
01:18:37,938 --> 01:18:39,339
And you believed
this stolen money

1230
01:18:39,341 --> 01:18:42,641
would all be used
to fight drug cartels?

1231
01:18:42,643 --> 01:18:45,078
Yes, sir. I thought the orders came down
the valid chain of command.

1232
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:47,380
Blind loyalty
is not loyalty.

1233
01:18:47,382 --> 01:18:49,115
I know that, sir,
and that's why I'm here.

1234
01:18:49,117 --> 01:18:51,050
Well, you've shown
a lot of tenacity

1235
01:18:51,052 --> 01:18:53,353
and a lot of guts
bringing this to me.

1236
01:18:53,355 --> 01:18:55,888
Thank you, sir. That means
the world comin' from you.

1237
01:18:55,890 --> 01:19:00,127
Unfortunately, there's
nothing I can do for you.

1238
01:19:00,129 --> 01:19:02,363
Of course, sir. I mean, you
can just lock down the base.

1239
01:19:02,365 --> 01:19:03,797
You can arrest
Commander Quince.

1240
01:19:03,799 --> 01:19:06,799
The United States Navy
does not rob banks.

1241
01:19:06,801 --> 01:19:09,001
Its personnel
did not rob a bank.

1242
01:19:09,003 --> 01:19:12,839
I'm not gonna tarnish the integrity
of the Navy over one crooked sailor.

1243
01:19:12,841 --> 01:19:14,408
If there was money
taken from the bank

1244
01:19:14,410 --> 01:19:17,544
that was part of
an illegal CIA slush fund,

1245
01:19:17,546 --> 01:19:19,880
the Navy had no knowledge
the fund existed.

1246
01:19:22,384 --> 01:19:24,084
Your jacket has you
six months AWOL?

1247
01:19:24,086 --> 01:19:25,619
Yes, sir.

1248
01:19:25,621 --> 01:19:27,421
It's gonna stay that way.

1249
01:19:29,759 --> 01:19:33,994
Commander Quince's jacket will
likewise be amended so he's also AWOL,

1250
01:19:33,996 --> 01:19:36,663
making none of this
the Navy's problem.

1251
01:19:36,665 --> 01:19:38,565
Sir, this isn't right.

1252
01:19:38,567 --> 01:19:40,667
Well, I'd offer more,

1253
01:19:40,669 --> 01:19:41,902
but when the hand
has gangrene,

1254
01:19:41,904 --> 01:19:44,873
you chop it off
to save the body.

1255
01:19:44,875 --> 01:19:48,610
You don't keep the pinkie around
just because it meant well.

1256
01:19:57,153 --> 01:20:00,989
Have Petty Officer Stigman
dropped outside the main gate.

1257
01:20:02,591 --> 01:20:04,893
He sets foot on a military
base anywhere in the world,

1258
01:20:06,195 --> 01:20:07,896
I want him shot.

1259
01:20:07,898 --> 01:20:11,767
You know, men like me fight and
die on the orders of men like you!

1260
01:20:11,769 --> 01:20:14,470
Without us, those stars on your
shoulder are a fucking costume!

1261
01:20:33,056 --> 01:20:34,457
Open the safe.

1262
01:20:34,459 --> 01:20:35,524
Does your boss know
you're doin' this?

1263
01:20:35,526 --> 01:20:38,794
Or did the CIA kill her
like they did Jessup?

1264
01:20:39,864 --> 01:20:41,030
What's it to you?

1265
01:20:41,032 --> 01:20:42,231
I don't like loose ends.

1266
01:20:42,233 --> 01:20:43,132
Neither do I...

1267
01:20:44,568 --> 01:20:45,668
Harvey.

1268
01:20:48,605 --> 01:20:50,506
Huh?

1269
01:20:50,508 --> 01:20:52,608
Well, my mother
named me Harold.

1270
01:20:52,610 --> 01:20:55,212
I like Harvey. Harvey
has a nice ring to it.

1271
01:20:55,214 --> 01:20:57,614
Don't you like Harvey?

1272
01:20:57,616 --> 01:20:59,916
I don't know what you're
talkin' about. Yes, you do.

1273
01:20:59,918 --> 01:21:02,052
Been to the Camino
Real Hotel lately?

1274
01:21:02,054 --> 01:21:02,986
Open the safe.

1275
01:21:10,094 --> 01:21:11,161
Staging area cleared up!

1276
01:21:11,163 --> 01:21:12,128
Bring it through!

1277
01:21:25,644 --> 01:21:26,511
Where's the money?

1278
01:21:27,679 --> 01:21:29,546
You tell me where Deb is.

1279
01:21:29,548 --> 01:21:31,948
She's gettin' her nails
done. Where is the money?

1280
01:21:31,950 --> 01:21:33,116
I don't know.

1281
01:21:35,286 --> 01:21:36,988
All right,
tell me what you do know.

1282
01:21:37,990 --> 01:21:40,024
Well, your girl
found out where the CIA

1283
01:21:40,026 --> 01:21:42,159
was stashing the money
right about when I did.

1284
01:21:42,161 --> 01:21:46,831
that she and I could get away with the
money by setting you and Stigman up,

1285
01:21:46,833 --> 01:21:48,032
she didn't even blink.

1286
01:21:48,034 --> 01:21:49,967
Don't lie to me.

1287
01:21:49,969 --> 01:21:52,003
Was she that
unhappy, Bobby?

1288
01:21:57,175 --> 01:22:00,545
Where is the money?
Don't lie to me.

1289
01:22:00,547 --> 01:22:03,047
You think I'd keep it here with
you and Stigman still alive?

1290
01:22:03,049 --> 01:22:05,217
Come on, Bobby.

1291
01:22:05,219 --> 01:22:07,119
You gave it to her,
didn't you?

1292
01:22:09,822 --> 01:22:11,790
Didn't you?

1293
01:22:11,792 --> 01:22:13,725
Commander.
Back up.

1294
01:22:17,829 --> 01:22:19,565
Go, go, go, go!
On your six!

1295
01:22:19,567 --> 01:22:20,866
Move, move, move!

1296
01:22:26,906 --> 01:22:32,344
<i>All personnel
evacuate the building.</i>

1297
01:22:36,116 --> 01:22:37,317
Take the back,
in that alley!

1298
01:22:37,319 --> 01:22:38,952
Go to the front!
Let's go!

1299
01:22:40,254 --> 01:22:41,353
Hey!

1300
01:22:41,355 --> 01:22:43,722
This way! Move!

1301
01:22:43,724 --> 01:22:45,157
Come on,
come on! Find him!

1302
01:23:30,104 --> 01:23:31,205
Clear!

1303
01:23:31,873 --> 01:23:32,940
Clear!

1304
01:24:02,805 --> 01:24:04,105
You okay?

1305
01:24:04,107 --> 01:24:05,674
Come on, let's go.

1306
01:24:30,834 --> 01:24:32,468
You okay, sir?
Yeah, I'm fine.

1307
01:24:44,381 --> 01:24:46,182
Work off the standpipe!

1308
01:24:48,018 --> 01:24:51,320
This is really
good barbecue.

1309
01:24:51,322 --> 01:24:54,857
You don't want to
regret not tryin' it.

1310
01:24:54,859 --> 01:24:57,894
Why don't you stop wasting
my time and just kill me?

1311
01:24:57,896 --> 01:25:00,230
Even if Bobby was
coming with the money,

1312
01:25:00,232 --> 01:25:02,264
you'd still kill us both.

1313
01:25:06,903 --> 01:25:07,970
But he's not coming.

1314
01:25:08,438 --> 01:25:10,239
He'll be here.
No.

1315
01:25:11,442 --> 01:25:13,477
He won't.

1316
01:25:13,479 --> 01:25:16,046
You think he's just
gonna let you die?

1317
01:25:16,048 --> 01:25:22,018
You think it was a coincidence the
Navy came looking for Bobby at my house?

1318
01:25:22,020 --> 01:25:25,223
If I couldn't have Bobby, at
least I'd have half of 43 million.

1319
01:25:28,860 --> 01:25:31,361
You set up Bobby Beans.

1320
01:25:31,363 --> 01:25:33,897
I wouldn't be
coming for you either.

1321
01:25:33,899 --> 01:25:35,132
Where's the money?

1322
01:25:35,134 --> 01:25:37,400
Come on. I don't know.

1323
01:25:37,402 --> 01:25:39,336
Gone, outta the country.

1324
01:25:39,338 --> 01:25:41,939
It's certainly not
on a Navy base, Papi.

1325
01:25:41,941 --> 01:25:43,508
Where does that leave you?

1326
01:25:45,444 --> 01:25:47,445
Exactly where
I deserve to be.

1327
01:25:55,021 --> 01:25:56,287
<i>Yeah.
Bobby.</i>

1328
01:25:58,490 --> 01:26:00,258
You're late.

1329
01:26:00,260 --> 01:26:01,559
I got the money.

1330
01:26:01,561 --> 01:26:03,427
<i>I don't believe you.</i>

1331
01:26:03,429 --> 01:26:06,497
<i>Believe me, I got.
I'll bring it to y.</i>

1332
01:26:07,866 --> 01:26:09,268
<i>Where are you?</i>

1333
01:26:09,569 --> 01:26:11,370
Hi, Bobby.

1334
01:26:11,372 --> 01:26:12,437
Debbie?

1335
01:26:15,374 --> 01:26:17,141
Can he hear us?

1336
01:26:17,143 --> 01:26:19,110
Just hang up
the phone and run.

1337
01:26:19,112 --> 01:26:20,444
<i>Okay, listen to me.</i>

1338
01:26:20,446 --> 01:26:23,448
<i>Tell him I got the money.</i>

1339
01:26:23,450 --> 01:26:24,850
Hang up the phone.

1340
01:26:27,821 --> 01:26:29,855
<i>It's not your faul.
Just...</i>

1341
01:26:29,857 --> 01:26:31,123
<i>Debbie.</i>

1342
01:26:31,125 --> 01:26:34,393
Tell him I have
the money. Okay?

1343
01:26:34,395 --> 01:26:37,196
<i>And I know you know
where the money is.</i>

1344
01:26:37,198 --> 01:26:39,464
Just tell him I have it.

1345
01:26:40,967 --> 01:26:44,036
<i>Debbie, listen to me.</i>

1346
01:26:44,038 --> 01:26:45,437
I'm sorry.

1347
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:49,408
I really meant
to love you.

1348
01:26:49,410 --> 01:26:50,576
<i>Debbie.</i>

1349
01:26:54,148 --> 01:26:56,883
<i>Where are you?
Debbie, where are yo?</i>

1350
01:26:59,620 --> 01:27:01,486
<i>Where are you? Debbie?</i>

1351
01:27:01,955 --> 01:27:03,222
<i>Hello?</i>

1352
01:27:03,590 --> 01:27:04,957
<i>Hello?</i>

1353
01:27:11,999 --> 01:27:13,166
Hello?

1354
01:27:15,270 --> 01:27:18,137
Hello?
Debbie? Uh...

1355
01:27:22,410 --> 01:27:24,611
Wait a minute,
I got the money.

1356
01:27:40,897 --> 01:27:42,663
What'd they say?
What'd the Admiral say?

1357
01:27:42,665 --> 01:27:45,366
What'd the Admiral say? Admiral
washed his hands of the whole thing.

1358
01:27:45,368 --> 01:27:46,667
Navy turned their back.

1359
01:27:46,669 --> 01:27:48,001
Where's the money?

1360
01:27:49,404 --> 01:27:52,139
There was no money, Stig.

1361
01:27:52,141 --> 01:27:53,908
What?
There was no money.

1362
01:27:53,910 --> 01:27:55,276
'Course there is.
I gave Quince the money.

1363
01:27:55,278 --> 01:27:57,611
Right, and Quince gave it
to Deb, and Deb is dead.

1364
01:28:00,148 --> 01:28:01,515
Papi killed her.

1365
01:28:05,488 --> 01:28:07,255
Fuck him.

1366
01:28:07,257 --> 01:28:11,225
We'll lure 'em all down, then take
every one of 'em out. Kill 'em all.

1367
01:28:12,060 --> 01:28:13,093
And then what?

1368
01:28:14,262 --> 01:28:15,629
Well, at least Quince
and Papi'd be dead.

1369
01:28:15,631 --> 01:28:17,098
And then what?

1370
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:18,233
Oh, you just wanna
let 'em skate?

1371
01:28:18,235 --> 01:28:20,001
You don't get it,
do ya, Stig?

1372
01:28:20,003 --> 01:28:22,037
I mean, God bless you, you still
think there's some kinda code.

1373
01:28:22,039 --> 01:28:26,508
You followed every order the Navy
gave you, they kicked you in the teeth.

1374
01:28:26,510 --> 01:28:31,013
No one fights for the Navy,
okay? It's not about the Navy.

1375
01:28:31,015 --> 01:28:33,215
You fight for the guy
that's fighting next to you.

1376
01:28:33,217 --> 01:28:35,984
That doesn't mean
anything to you?

1377
01:28:35,986 --> 01:28:37,719
I'm goin' to Mexico.

1378
01:28:37,721 --> 01:28:42,424
And just so you know,
my code saved your life.

1379
01:28:42,426 --> 01:28:44,159
There's three inches between
your heart and your shoulder.

1380
01:28:44,161 --> 01:28:46,062
My bullet goes three
inches left, you'd be dead.

1381
01:28:46,064 --> 01:28:50,099
'Cause Quince only decided to
kill me because I let you live.

1382
01:28:50,101 --> 01:28:52,535
What, you think
I missed, huh?

1383
01:28:52,537 --> 01:28:55,438
Is that what you think?
You think I missed?

1384
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:57,306
When have you
ever seen me miss?

1385
01:28:59,743 --> 01:29:02,144
You stay here.
I'm goin' to Mexico.

1386
01:31:06,673 --> 01:31:09,309
Our deal still stand?

1387
01:31:09,311 --> 01:31:11,444
I give you the money,
I walk away clean?

1388
01:31:23,557 --> 01:31:26,526
<i>Hola. Looks like you
had a banner morning.</i>

1389
01:31:26,528 --> 01:31:28,428
You better have my money.

1390
01:31:28,430 --> 01:31:29,662
Right here.
Every penny.

1391
01:31:30,331 --> 01:31:31,664
Where's Bobby?

1392
01:31:31,666 --> 01:31:33,633
We had a philosophical
fallin' out.

1393
01:31:33,635 --> 01:31:38,472
I just want your word that you and your
boys, Ferret Nose Julio, all of 'em,

1394
01:31:38,474 --> 01:31:40,241
you'll help me
kill Commander Quince.

1395
01:31:40,243 --> 01:31:41,609
Who's Commander Quince?

1396
01:31:43,346 --> 01:31:44,477
That's him.

1397
01:31:52,354 --> 01:31:54,655
Mr. Stigman, you promised me $43 million

1398
01:31:54,657 --> 01:31:56,390
for killin' everyone
on this ranch.

1399
01:31:56,392 --> 01:31:57,725
Got the money
right here, sir.

1400
01:31:57,727 --> 01:31:59,760
Thing is, I promised Papi
the $43 million, too,

1401
01:31:59,762 --> 01:32:01,562
so I'm afraid you two are
gonna have to duke it out.

1402
01:32:01,564 --> 01:32:03,931
Maybe he and I'll just kill
you instead and split the money.

1403
01:32:03,933 --> 01:32:04,832
What do you say, Papi?

1404
01:32:05,701 --> 01:32:08,169
50% of 40 million?

1405
01:32:08,171 --> 01:32:10,271
Better than 100% dead,
right?

1406
01:32:10,273 --> 01:32:12,706
He'll double-cross you. Minute your
back is turned, bullet in the head.

1407
01:32:14,876 --> 01:32:16,610
50-50.

1408
01:32:16,612 --> 01:32:18,679
The guy up on the roof
says 60-40.

1409
01:32:18,681 --> 01:32:20,615
He ain't got a trustworthy
bone in his body.

1410
01:32:20,617 --> 01:32:22,617
I came back,
didn't I?

1411
01:32:52,950 --> 01:32:54,684
Fuckin' CIA.

1412
01:32:56,385 --> 01:32:58,653
Red rover, red rover.

1413
01:32:58,655 --> 01:33:03,459
Whoever's got my 43.125 million
better come the fuck on out.

1414
01:33:03,461 --> 01:33:04,961
You offer him
the money, too?

1415
01:33:04,963 --> 01:33:06,262
I didn't call him.

1416
01:33:06,264 --> 01:33:07,630
It's in the trunk!

1417
01:33:07,632 --> 01:33:09,465
Why the fuck did
you tell him that?

1418
01:33:10,668 --> 01:33:12,001
Thank you, Commander.

1419
01:33:12,003 --> 01:33:15,338
Mr. Stigman, come on
out and open the trunk.

1420
01:33:15,340 --> 01:33:16,740
Nice and slow, now.

1421
01:33:27,884 --> 01:33:30,419
Well, what do
we got here?

1422
01:33:30,421 --> 01:33:31,855
Sounds like
a Mexican wedding.

1423
01:33:54,379 --> 01:33:56,046
Is that my '64 Impala?

1424
01:33:56,814 --> 01:33:57,948
That's correct.

1425
01:33:59,284 --> 01:34:00,451
I told you.

1426
01:34:01,287 --> 01:34:02,954
I know a guy.

1427
01:34:02,956 --> 01:34:04,389
Now,

1428
01:34:04,391 --> 01:34:06,590
who wants to see
$43 million?

1429
01:34:10,295 --> 01:34:12,596
For a minute there, I thought
you had me chasing my tail.

1430
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:16,401
You want to count it?

1431
01:34:16,403 --> 01:34:18,369
If you're shortin' me,
I know where to find you.

1432
01:34:18,371 --> 01:34:19,637
So we're good?

1433
01:34:19,639 --> 01:34:20,905
Did I not give
you my word?

1434
01:34:20,907 --> 01:34:22,006
That's right.

1435
01:34:22,008 --> 01:34:24,042
Then don't treat me
like an asshole.

1436
01:34:24,044 --> 01:34:25,310
I'll try my best.

1437
01:34:28,682 --> 01:34:31,549
You and Mr. Stigman
are free to go.

1438
01:34:31,551 --> 01:34:32,850
Yes, sir.

1439
01:34:32,852 --> 01:34:34,319
I trust you can
find your own way home?

1440
01:34:34,321 --> 01:34:35,586
That's right.

1441
01:34:35,588 --> 01:34:36,988
What're you doing, Bobby?
Let's go.

1442
01:34:36,990 --> 01:34:38,656
I'm not gonna let him
get away with the money.

1443
01:34:38,658 --> 01:34:39,824
Let's go.
I hate these daggone teeth.

1444
01:34:39,826 --> 01:34:40,992
They're not just
gonna let us go.

1445
01:34:40,994 --> 01:34:42,995
I got a plan.
Hey, I got my M-16.

1446
01:34:42,997 --> 01:34:45,464
I got my grenade launcher, I
got my M-4. Let's do this shit.

1447
01:34:45,466 --> 01:34:47,766
I got a plan. I'm capable
of coming up with a plan.

1448
01:34:47,768 --> 01:34:48,867
Well, it better be
a goddamn good one.

1449
01:34:48,869 --> 01:34:50,002
It's a good plan.

1450
01:34:50,004 --> 01:34:51,103
Make it rain.

1451
01:35:23,703 --> 01:35:25,805
That was your plan?
To blow up $43 million?

1452
01:35:25,807 --> 01:35:28,108
Yeah, that's why it's a brilliant
plan. Nobody expected it.

1453
01:35:29,644 --> 01:35:30,710
Go.

1454
01:36:03,078 --> 01:36:04,645
Come on, move it!

1455
01:36:07,148 --> 01:36:08,516
Dumb assholes!
Move it!

1456
01:36:22,164 --> 01:36:23,031
You comin'?

1457
01:36:31,139 --> 01:36:32,606
Go ahead, I'll be right behind you.

1458
01:36:32,608 --> 01:36:33,674
Don't miss.

1459
01:36:33,676 --> 01:36:35,042
I never miss!

1460
01:36:41,617 --> 01:36:42,684
Told ya.

1461
01:37:12,249 --> 01:37:14,550
Stig! Stig!

1462
01:37:20,757 --> 01:37:22,158
Don't do it.
Don't do it.

1463
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:23,059
Playtime's over.

1464
01:37:24,728 --> 01:37:26,596
No more fucking around.

1465
01:37:26,598 --> 01:37:27,864
Now,

1466
01:37:27,866 --> 01:37:30,166
drop your weapon.

1467
01:37:30,168 --> 01:37:32,068
Tell Mr. Stigman
to do the same.

1468
01:37:32,070 --> 01:37:33,102
You tell him.

1469
01:37:34,772 --> 01:37:36,773
It's real simple.

1470
01:37:36,775 --> 01:37:39,243
We can all make a deal
or we can all die.

1471
01:37:39,245 --> 01:37:40,977
I'm not making
any deals.

1472
01:37:40,979 --> 01:37:42,578
Talk to your man, Bobby.

1473
01:37:42,580 --> 01:37:44,213
Be the smart one.

1474
01:37:44,215 --> 01:37:47,116
You think Tres Cruces
is the only stash we got?

1475
01:37:47,118 --> 01:37:50,687
We got 20 more.
We got money everywhere.

1476
01:37:50,689 --> 01:37:52,155
You're not gonna
change a damn thing.

1477
01:37:52,157 --> 01:37:53,023
Stig?

1478
01:37:53,291 --> 01:37:54,725
Yeah?

1479
01:37:56,628 --> 01:37:57,967
You're my people, right?

1480
01:37:59,230 --> 01:38:00,864
That's correct.

1481
01:38:13,978 --> 01:38:15,012
You good?

1482
01:38:16,047 --> 01:38:17,815
Never better.

1483
01:38:17,817 --> 01:38:19,817
We're not people,
though.

1484
01:38:19,819 --> 01:38:20,952
This makes us family.

1485
01:38:21,687 --> 01:38:24,055
All right, brother.

1486
01:38:24,057 --> 01:38:27,691
you're looking kind of
fucked up sittin' there, man.

1487
01:38:27,693 --> 01:38:28,559
You all right?

1488
01:38:32,731 --> 01:38:34,599
Mow my lawn.

1489
01:38:47,180 --> 01:38:48,213
Well, you know
what was so cool?

1490
01:38:48,215 --> 01:38:50,182
You rolling in
on that '64 Impala.

1491
01:38:50,184 --> 01:38:51,983
I mean, you looked
badass, man.

1492
01:38:51,985 --> 01:38:53,217
Yeah, that's right.

1493
01:38:53,219 --> 01:38:55,253
Listen, one more thing,
one more thing.

1494
01:38:55,255 --> 01:38:56,621
What?

1495
01:38:56,623 --> 01:38:57,755
Give me your gun.

1496
01:38:58,357 --> 01:38:59,925
Give me your gun.

1497
01:38:59,927 --> 01:39:00,826
You're not serious.

1498
01:39:00,828 --> 01:39:01,894
Yes, I am.

1499
01:39:02,196 --> 01:39:05,364
You're really gonna do this after
everything we've been through?

1500
01:39:05,366 --> 01:39:07,333
Arm or leg?

1501
01:39:07,335 --> 01:39:12,004
I'm thinking leg. Because leg, there's
more flesh, there's not as much bone.

1502
01:39:12,006 --> 01:39:13,238
The arm will...

1503
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:15,040
You know what you are?
You are a petty...

1504
01:39:15,042 --> 01:39:17,643
Fucking son of a bitch!

1505
01:39:17,645 --> 01:39:19,378
Hurts, doesn't it? You
know you coulda killed me?

1506
01:39:19,380 --> 01:39:21,380
Is that right? Three
more inches to the left.

1507
01:39:21,382 --> 01:39:25,985
I'd still wink, I just wouldn't
be able to do anything about it.

1508
01:39:25,987 --> 01:39:27,386
You know me,
I don't miss.

1509
01:39:27,388 --> 01:39:30,056
I never miss. When's the
last time you saw me miss?

1510
01:39:30,058 --> 01:39:32,792
You gonna carry my ass
all the way the fuck home.

1511
01:39:32,794 --> 01:39:34,894
Oh, shit, man.
This burns.

1512
01:39:34,896 --> 01:39:37,664
That's correct.

1513
01:39:37,666 --> 01:39:40,099
You know, I shot you when
I didn't know who you were.

1514
01:39:40,101 --> 01:39:41,767
Before we were family.

1515
01:39:41,769 --> 01:39:45,138
But we're family now. I shot you because
I know who you are.

1516
01:39:45,140 --> 01:39:46,172
That ain't right.

1517
01:40:04,659 --> 01:40:06,426
They definitely
got the look.

1518
01:40:06,428 --> 01:40:10,830
Assholes and windshield
sunglasses, practically CIA uniform.

1519
01:40:10,832 --> 01:40:12,066
Can I get you boys
anything else?

1520
01:40:13,235 --> 01:40:14,201
Are your doughnuts
any good?

1521
01:40:15,404 --> 01:40:18,172
Tell you the truth,
they're pretty lousy.

1522
01:40:18,174 --> 01:40:20,207
Can't tell you how happy
we are to hear that.

1523
01:40:22,210 --> 01:40:23,778
You take care.

1524
01:40:23,780 --> 01:40:24,945
I saw that.

1525
01:40:24,947 --> 01:40:26,247
Saw what?
You winked.

1526
01:40:26,249 --> 01:40:27,848
That's a twitch.
Yeah, right.

1527
01:40:33,155 --> 01:40:35,056
You know, for a guy who
just blew up $43 million,

1528
01:40:35,058 --> 01:40:37,191
all of a sudden, you are
a very generous tipper.

1529
01:40:37,193 --> 01:40:39,326
Who said I blew up
$43 million?

1530
01:40:41,097 --> 01:40:42,364
What are you sayin'?

1531
01:40:42,366 --> 01:40:45,901
I'm hearin' somethin'.
You're sayin' somethin'.

1532
01:40:45,903 --> 01:40:47,736
Well, if you're hearin' it, it's
only because you're hearin' it,

1533
01:40:47,738 --> 01:40:50,037
not 'cause I'm sayin' it.

1534
01:40:50,039 --> 01:40:51,405
How much did you keep?

1535
01:40:52,474 --> 01:40:53,808
Two million?

1536
01:40:54,944 --> 01:40:56,445
That's like one each.

1537
01:40:56,447 --> 01:40:57,913
So now you get half?

1538
01:40:57,915 --> 01:40:59,915
Well, I shot half the guys. So?

1539
01:41:01,150 --> 01:41:02,250
Two million?
