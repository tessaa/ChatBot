1
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:45,288
I'm so...
I'm so glad you called.

2
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:47,332
I'm so glad
you were free.

3
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:50,296
God,
I love your eyes.

4
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,708
Okay, now what?

5
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,505
Cup my balls.

6
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,383
Okay, yes.
All right. I can do that.

7
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:58,838
- Oh! There it is.
- There we go.

8
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:01,926
That feels good.

9
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:04,310
You know what to do.

10
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,561
Okay, you know what?
Slow it down, slow it down.

11
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:10,517
Okay.
Slow it down.

12
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,356
There we go.
How's that?

13
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:16,281
That's good, nice and slow.
See? Doesn't that feel good?

14
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:17,574
Yeah.
No, I want to go fast.

15
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:19,492
You want to go fast?
Fast.

16
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:24,239
Yeah. No...

17
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:25,665
Oh, yeah.
That feels good.

18
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,083
Oh, Yeah.

19
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,330
Yeah.

20
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:31,914
Okay.
You know what?
I think...

21
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:33,840
I think maybe
we are on different
rhythms here.

22
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:23,724
I was having a nightmare.
I was so scared.

23
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,310
Good morning.

24
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,893
You look beautiful.

25
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,315
No, I'm sure
I look terrible.

26
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,358
I just woke up.
Are you kidding?

27
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:36,232
I'm sure I'm a mess.

28
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,487
You slept over.

29
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,236
I did.

30
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,909
I thought we had
a rule against that.

31
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,110
Oh.

32
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:46,071
I'm kidding.
Oh.

33
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,531
That was funny.
I'm kidding.

34
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:49,491
You're funny
in the morning.

35
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,167
I like hanging out
with you.
Oh. Yeah.

36
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:54,667
I love hanging out with you.
I think we get
along really well

37
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:58,421
and you're so sexy.

38
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,343
I know.

39
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,716
I just have a lot
coming up at work

40
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:08,473
and I don't want
to make promises
I can't keep.

41
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:10,353
You know what I mean?
I know you do.

42
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,396
Yeah.
We're on the same page.

43
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:15,442
I'm not looking for
a relationship right now,
either. Let's just say that.

44
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:18,362
Whatever you wanna...
I can do...

45
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:22,361
I'd rather just...
I like simple...
I'm not like other girls.

46
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:25,535
I'm not like,
"Be my boyfriend!"
Unless you were like, "Yeah!"

47
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,613
Then I'd be like,
"Maybe."

48
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,990
Mmm. But let's not.

49
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:32,121
I don't want that either.

50
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,384
Wow, this is so awkward.
I really want you to leave,

51
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:49,263
but I don't know how to say it
without sounding like a dick.

52
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:51,037
Come on!
Hands behind your heads!
Let's go! Sit-ups!

53
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,583
You're looking
like pieces of bacon
on a plate.

54
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:57,581
It's disgusting!
I smell the fat!

55
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,246
He scares me.
Me, too.

56
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:01,457
But he's
an excellent motivator.

57
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:02,753
That's true.

58
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,800
What are you looking at?

59
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,045
Oh, Shit, he sees us.
Oh, God.

60
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:08,885
Hey! Hey!

61
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,845
If you want to
take this class,

62
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:13,017
you're going to
have to pay for it

63
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,102
like the rest
of these bitches!

64
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,273
What, are you dancing?
In the park...
Dance class?

65
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:21,230
You are not dancing.
You are not
dancing in the park!

66
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,235
Go, go, go, go!
- Freeloaders!

67
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,483
I'm coming over there.

68
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,106
Is he coming?
- I'm coming after you!

69
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:28,567
Sorry, Rodney.
We're on a budget.

70
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,994
Oh, come on!
It's only 12 bucks!

71
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:32,579
Oh, my God!

72
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,245
Come on!
You fucking freeloaders.

73
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,665
We are out
of our minds.
I know.

74
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,747
That's okay.
I'm so glad that
we got to do this.

75
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,048
I feel like I haven't
seen you in forever.

76
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:44,673
Mmm. I've been
in Chicago a lot.

77
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,756
I know.
Sleeping at Dougie's house.

78
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,462
Well, it's just
closer to work.

79
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,050
How is it going
with him anyway?

80
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:53,007
I don't know.
I mean, it's fine,

81
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,009
but I just feel
like he's been
distant lately.

82
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:56,845
And I don't know...

83
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,396
He calls me
"dude" a lot.

84
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,599
That doesn't mean anything.

85
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,062
I think everything is fine.

86
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,609
I don't know.
Anyway,

87
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,441
what did you
do last night?

88
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,355
Umm...

89
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,940
What did you
do last night?

90
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:12,949
You are not
telling me something.

91
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,368
I hung out with
Ted for a little bit.

92
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:19,372
I knew it!
We had fun.

93
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,536
It was fun.
Here's what I
don't like about it.

94
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,923
You hate yourself
after you see him,
every time.

95
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,208
And then we go through this,
and then you feel like shit,

96
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:28,760
and it's almost
like you're doing it

97
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,345
because you feel
bad about yourself.

98
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:34,137
He called me late,
and we hung out.

99
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,843
It wasn't a big deal.
And you know what?
It was fun.

100
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,311
Ew! You had
sex with him.

101
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:43,650
We had an
adult sleepover.

102
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,358
Ooh. Did you let him
sleep over in your mouth?

103
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,491
Annie!
I'm sorry!

104
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:55,487
You're unbelievable.
He kept putting
it near my face.

105
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:56,954
They do that,
don't they?

106
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,163
Why do they do that?
Let us offer.

107
00:06:58,501 --> 00:06:59,490
If we don't offer...

108
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:00,583
Please.
You're supposed
to slap it away.

109
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,659
I couldn't.

110
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:05,542
You don't want to
look right at it.

111
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:06,835
No.

112
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,964
It's too aggressive.
It's like...

113
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:11,420
"Hello."

114
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:12,549
That's my impression.

115
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:13,596
Those are the balls?

116
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,264
Yeah.
I'm trying to make it round,

117
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:16,974
but I can't
because I have elbows.

118
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:20,683
He is so hot, though.

119
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:25,021
Look, I know
you say he's cute
and all that stuff,

120
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,067
but it makes you feel
like shit, you know?

121
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,146
You're a total catch,
and any guy

122
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,273
would be psyched
to be your man.

123
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:33,700
You should just
make room

124
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:36,240
for somebody who
is nice to you.

125
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:38,322
You know what?
He's honest!

126
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,156
He told me that
we are what we are

127
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,033
and we're just having fun.
And I like that.

128
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:45,336
He also told you that
you need dental work.
He's an asshole.

129
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:51,209
I don't need dental work.

130
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:52,881
You're right.

131
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,174
There is nothing
wrong with my teeth.

132
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,176
You are so beautiful.

133
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,467
Will you marry me?
Yes.

134
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:03,639
I love you.

135
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:07,484
I don't want to
go to work today.
Mmm-mmm.

136
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,652
Let's see how many
times Terry's called me.

137
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:10,728
Oh! Only 15!

138
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,359
You know what, Terry?
I don't want

139
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,236
to pick up your
monkey lamps.
Sorry!

140
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,405
Monkey lamps?

141
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,363
Ugh. I cannot wait
to never work for
a psychopath again.

142
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:21,955
Oh! Annie!

143
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:25,001
I'm sorry. I should
have gone down Mason.

144
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:28,663
Well, I'm the genius
that opened a bakery
during the recession.

145
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,086
They were good cakes,
Annie.

146
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,508
Thank you.

147
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,712
Come on. Look away,
look away, look away.

148
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,552
Do you have any
ideas of styles?

149
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:42,806
Oh, I don't know.
What do you think, honey?

150
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,099
Whatever you want.

151
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:46,230
Look at how you guys
are making this
decision together.

152
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,441
That's sweet. You guys
love each other, huh?

153
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,018
Yeah.
Yeah.

154
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:52,858
Ohh! That's sweet.
That will go away.

155
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:00,654
You cannot
trust anybody, ever.

156
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,955
Especially someone
you're in a
relationship with.

157
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,453
'Cause they're
living with you,
you don't

158
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,083
know who you're
sleeping next to.
It is scary.

159
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,788
I mean, look at him.
He may not even be Asian.

160
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,960
It is scary.

161
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,836
So did you guys
want to look at
these engagement rings?

162
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,172
We're going to browse.
Okay, sure.

163
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,598
I'll be here.

164
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:25,812
Thank you.

165
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:27,680
What was that about?

166
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,564
Umm, nothing.
They had to run.
They had to go somewhere.

167
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,815
And no wonder.
You're selling
lifelong happiness.

168
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,943
You're not telling everyone
about your problems

169
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,524
and how your
boyfriend left you,

170
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,196
and maybe marriage
will work out.

171
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,824
Show me your
"love is eternal" face.

172
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:47,500
No, that's two years,
four years tops.
That is not eternal.

173
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,329
Kahlua, can you
come over here
for a second, please?

174
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,163
What's up, Don-Don?

175
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,836
You make up
the best nicknames.

176
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:57,711
You don't need
a nickname because
Kahlua is so delicious.

177
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,007
Don't sue me
for touching you.

178
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,640
Show Annie your
"love is eternal" face.

179
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,853
That looks like you
have menstrual cramps.

180
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:13,397
Thank you so much,
Kahlua.

181
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,065
Now, why can't you
be more like Kahlua?

182
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,195
Look, I'm trying
really hard.

183
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,405
You've just
got to try harder.

184
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:23,282
The whole reason
you have got this job,
Annie,

185
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:26,331
is because your mom
is my sponsor in AA,
and I'm doing her a favor.

186
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,406
I understand.

187
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,036
Oscar, get back to work.

188
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:34,922
You shouldn't be
behind the counter.

189
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,889
<i>Andrew,</i>
<i>you are not the father!</i>

190
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,726
That's great. Yeah.

191
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,561
Stop that.
Don't do that.

192
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:55,811
Hey, Brynn.

193
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,270
Oh, hey, roomie.

194
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:00,072
Guess what
happened to me today.
Hmm. What?

195
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,279
I got a free tattoo.
You did what?

196
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:05,199
I could not believe it.
The guy said,
"Do you want a tattoo?"

197
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,245
Just a random...

198
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,114
Yeah, opened up
the side of his van.
No.

199
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,621
He said, "It's for free!"
And I said, "Sure."

200
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,042
You said yes?
Yeah!

201
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,496
Yeah. Look.
See here?

202
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:15,956
What is it?

203
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:18,083
See that?

204
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,672
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, Brynn!

205
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,095
It's a Mexican drinking worm.

206
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:26,432
It's a Native American
symbol meaning "wasted."

207
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,510
Okay, Brynn,
just so you know,
it's...

208
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,220
Gil, hi.
Hello. How are you?

209
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:32,977
Have you seen
your sister's tattoo?
It's really infected.

210
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,224
Better get
a little bit of ice on it.

211
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,475
Yeah, a little bit.

212
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:36,901
Stick some
frozen peas on there.

213
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:39,024
Yeah. It can't hurt.
All right.

214
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,447
So, I just wanted
a quick word.

215
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,359
You know that
tomorrow the rent is due.

216
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:45,614
I was getting my check,
and I wondered

217
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:46,953
if I could get
your check, too?

218
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,281
Yes.
I'm getting
the money.

219
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,037
It's been
a little slow.

220
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:58,043
You have to
keep it in the bag
and put the bag on it.

221
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:05,714
So, the check?

222
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:07,882
Yes. Yes.
Yeah.

223
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:11,310
Because it's a kind of,
like, "needing it
today"-type situation.

224
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,477
It's coming.

225
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,148
- Who is it?
- Me!

226
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,312
Who is it?

227
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,269
Oh, my God.
Hurry up, your creepy
neighbor asked me

228
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:20,900
if I wanted to
watch the news again.

229
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,526
Sorry.
He is so gross.

230
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:25,074
Please, come on in.
Let me take your magazines.

231
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:28,244
Welcome to the magazine
and wine party. Ooh!

232
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,204
Have a seat.

233
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,532
I'm very happy
that you are here.

234
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:35,664
What?
Because I want
to eat an apple.

235
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:38,288
Would you like
some apple?

236
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,546
What is that?
I got engaged.

237
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,214
What?
He asked me last night.

238
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,966
What?
I know!

239
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,513
That's why he's
been acting so weird

240
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,761
'cause he's a terrible liar,
and he thought he
was gonna blow it.

241
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:50,887
He was ignoring
me and I thought

242
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,100
he was going to
break up with me.

243
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,303
Oh, my gosh.

244
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:56,639
Oh, my gosh!

245
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:57,811
I know!

246
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,392
Lil!

247
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:00,939
I'm shocked, still.

248
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,520
But I'm happy.
Can you believe this?

249
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,402
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, I just got hot.

250
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:06,737
You did?
Are you okay?

251
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:07,783
Yes. My pits
are sweating.

252
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,451
My stomach hurts. I'm hot.
What does that mean?

253
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:12,702
Oh, my God!
What is happening?

254
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:14,950
I don't know.
I'm wearing a ring.

255
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,621
I can't believe it.

256
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:17,873
Lil, you're getting married.

257
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,253
I'm getting married.

258
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,873
And you'll be
my maid of honor.

259
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:24,459
God, of course I will!

260
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:25,919
It will be super fun.
It's gonna be really fun.

261
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:28,050
Yeah. You know,
we can plan
everything together.

262
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,678
My God!
Planning your wedding...

263
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,016
Are you sure
you're up for it?

264
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:34,344
I know it's a lot to ask
and to put on your plate.

265
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:37,397
And you're going
through a tricky time,
and you're super-busy...

266
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,973
Stop.
It's a lot to ask.

267
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,103
Stop.
Okay.

268
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:43,937
It's fine. And I'm
more than happy to do it,
and it's not too much.

269
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:47,277
Oh! Look at that.
It's my fiancé calling.

270
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,820
Oh, your fiancé.

271
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,492
Hi, baby,
what's up?

272
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,952
It's Annie.
I just told her!
Yeah, she's so happy.

273
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:56,328
No, I'm not!

274
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:58,580
"Yay," she said.

275
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:01,621
What, baby?

276
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,047
I know,
I miss you, too.

277
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,672
Yeah,
I'll meet you in an hour.

278
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:09,838
I love you, too.

279
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:34,616
<i>Wow.</i>

280
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,872
Wynonna Judd.

281
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,707
That's really good.

282
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:42,538
Painting those giant bangs
was a royal pain in my can.

283
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:45,669
And those teeth!
I should have
painted her mouth shut.

284
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:48,134
Can you just get dressed?
We're gonna be late
for the engagement party.

285
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,336
Oh, I forgot
to tell you, honey.
What?

286
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,545
Forgot to tell you.
What?

287
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,474
I signed up to
speak at AA tonight,
and I just have to.

288
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,766
Mom!
No.

289
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:58,344
I forgot. I'm sorry.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

290
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,896
I keep telling you,
you're not supposed
to go to those things.

291
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,063
You're not an alcoholic.

292
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,107
Only because I've
never had a drink.

293
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,319
What?
They are inspiring.

294
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,985
There is this one story
I've just got to tell you.
Sit down.

295
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,441
Okay.

296
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:12,942
This gentleman

297
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:16,200
who started
blow-jobbing to get crack.
His name is Marvin Johnson...

298
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:20,075
Mom, anonymous.
You keep... It's no names.
Okay, okay.

299
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,410
Forget it.
Marvin J. Whatever.

300
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,079
Too late.
Well, he became
a gay prostitute.

301
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,460
And he realized that
he had hit his bottom.

302
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:30,089
And I have been thinking,
honey,

303
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:33,046
that maybe this
is your bottom.

304
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:36,967
I'm telling you,
hitting bottom
is a good thing.

305
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:40,679
Because there's
nowhere to go but up.

306
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,183
Right?
Yep. That's what you say.

307
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,519
Yeah, a positive message.
Yeah.

308
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,647
Yeah. Thanks for
the pep talk, Mom.

309
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,819
Honey. Anytime, anytime.

310
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:51,648
All right. I guess I'm
going to Lillian's party
by myself, then.

311
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,032
Don't talk to me
about being by yourself.

312
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,444
I go everywhere
by myself.

313
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,075
Thanks to that
new whore, Barb.

314
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,952
Mom, come on.
No, I don't like to say it.

315
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,873
They've been
married 12 years.

316
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:03,789
Okay.
But she's still a whore.

317
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,372
I'm sure she greets
him in the evening,
beaver first.

318
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,131
I don't want to
think about that.

319
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:13,795
I bet she got that car
by giving your dad
something sexually.

320
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,801
'Cause there was
one thing I would
never do,

321
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,303
and I'm sure Barb
is a champion at it.

322
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,600
I don't want to know.

323
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:21,515
It's called
a "chicken coop."
Of course it is.

324
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:23,471
You start at the back
and you peck your way

325
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:24,976
to the front like
you have a beak.

326
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:28,309
And then you end up
with two eggs
in your mouth.

327
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,152
That's gross.

328
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,855
Well, I'm sure
your dad likes it.

329
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,236
Of course,
he grew up on a farm.

330
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:36,317
Okay.

331
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:38,661
You sure you don't
want to move in with me?

332
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,202
Mom, thanks,
but no way.

333
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,749
No way in hell.
Yeah?

334
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:44,825
No, thanks.

335
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:46,331
Think about it.
Okay.

336
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:47,537
You don't need
your own place.

337
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:49,588
Yeah, I kind of do.
Okay.

338
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:50,998
All right,
I'm going to go.
All right.

339
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,442
Holy shit.

340
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,117
Ohh. Valet. Perfect.

341
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,581
Sorry.
Needs a wash.

342
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,796
You have to
punch it a few times

343
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:47,892
Annie!

344
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:49,807
Oh, my God!

345
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,818
Oh, my God,
Lillian.
I know.

346
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,980
This is your
engagement party.
Isn't that crazy?

347
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,735
It's so beautiful.

348
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:58,817
I can't believe
Dougie's boss
is a member here.

349
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:02,491
I know,
and his parents, too.
And Dougie, I guess.

350
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,780
Gosh, and me,
I guess, too, now.

351
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,791
Come on, let's go
say hi to the rest
of the bridal party!

352
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:10,495
You remember
my cousin Rita?

353
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,621
Rita.
Annie.

354
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:16,505
I haven't seen you
since you
graduated high school.

355
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:17,877
She has
three kids now.

356
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:20,096
Three boys.
- They're so cute.

357
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,845
They are cute,
but when they
reach that age,

358
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,300
they are disgusting.

359
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:26,306
They smell,
they are sticky,

360
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:28,471
they say things
that are horrible,

361
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:31,603
and there is semen all
over everything, okay?

362
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,274
Disgusting.

363
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,443
I cracked
a blanket in half.

364
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,271
Do you get where
I'm going with that?
I do.

365
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,572
I cracked it
in half.

366
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:39,907
What?

367
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:42,618
Annie,
this is Becca,
my friend from work.

368
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:43,694
We are in
the trenches together.

369
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:44,949
Hey. It's great
to meet you.
Hey, how are you?

370
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,284
Nice to meet you.

371
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:47,532
This is my husband,
Kevin.

372
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:48,833
Hi.
"Husband."

373
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,125
I like to say it.
We are newlyweds.

374
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:51,456
Wow. Congratulations.

375
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:52,711
Thank you so much.

376
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,418
We went on
a sweetheart honeymoon.
Oh.

377
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:57,754
Where did you guys go?

378
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,210
Disney World.
Disney World.

379
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:00,670
We finish each
other's sentences.
Sorry.

380
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:06,426
Sorry.
Is this your husband?

381
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,179
No, no, no, no, no.

382
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,980
I don't know him.
I'm sorry.

383
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,809
Do you want to go
for a walk later?

384
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:16,527
Oh. I can't.

385
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:18,817
All right.
I can't. I'm sorry.

386
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,193
I'm so sorry.

387
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,366
I'm not with anybody.
I'm here solo.

388
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:26,408
Let's start it again.
I'm Becca.
Rewind.

389
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:29,491
This is my husband.
You don't have a husband.

390
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:31,576
Sorry.

391
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:34,504
And this is
Dougie's sister, Megan.

392
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,670
Hey.
- Hi.

393
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,250
My grandma is not
supposed to have wine.
I'll be right back.

394
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:43,258
Hey.
Hey. How is it going?

395
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:46,307
It's going great.
It's going great.
I'm on the mend.

396
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:48,225
I just got some
pins in my legs.

397
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:52,438
Believe it or not,
pins in my legs,
I can still do this. Right?

398
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,937
I fell off a cruise ship,
but I'm back.

399
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,608
Oh, shit.
Yeah, "Oh, shit."

400
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,356
Yeah, "Oh, shit."

401
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:02,865
Took a hard,
hard, violent fall.
Kind of pinballed down.

402
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:05,159
Hit a lot of railings,
broke a lot of shit.

403
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:08,283
I'm not going to
say I survived,
I'm going to say I thrived.

404
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,369
I met a dolphin down there.

405
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,668
And I swear to God,
that dolphin looked
not at me,

406
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:14,960
but into my soul.

407
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,708
Into my goddamn soul, Annie.

408
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,464
And he said,
"I'm saving you, Megan."

409
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:24,128
Not with his mouth,
but he said it,
I'm assuming, telepathically.

410
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:28,846
We had a connection
that I don't even
know if I can... Jesus.

411
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:33,475
Hey, shut my mouth.
Look at... Unbelievable.

412
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:34,726
You must be Annie's fella.

413
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:37,024
I'm Megan.
It's a pleasure.

414
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:40,190
He's not...
I'm not... He's not...
I'm not with him.

415
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:41,732
Sorry.
All right.

416
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:45,028
I'm glad he's single,
because I'm going to
climb that like a tree.

417
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:49,154
Okay. You have
to meet Helen.

418
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,909
There she is. Helen.

419
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:56,043
Come here!

420
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,257
Helen, this is Annie.

421
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,333
Hi!
Ohh!

422
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:06,296
There she is.
Maid of honor.

423
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:09,507
So lovely to meet
Lillian's childhood friend.

424
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:12,389
You are so pretty.

425
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:15,514
You are so cute!
You are so sweet.

426
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:20,564
Helen is married
to Dougie's boss,
Mr. Harris. Perry.

427
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,519
Perry. And they
are so close now,

428
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,355
they are literally
joined at the hip.

429
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,190
Which is good,
because so are we.

430
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,493
I know.
I'm so glad you guys
are finally meeting.

431
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,571
I know. Me, too.
I know. It's lovely.

432
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,407
Well, excuse me,
I better go check on
the hors d'oeuvres.

433
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:36,242
But it was great
to finally meet you.

434
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,035
It's a great party.

435
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,415
Enjoy.
- Bye.

436
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:40,872
Bye.
- Bye.

437
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,255
She's great, isn't she?

438
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:46,961
She's awesome.

439
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,681
<i>And I really</i>
<i>look forward to having</i>
<i>Doug as part of our family.</i>

440
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:53,972
So much so
that you two should
get married right now

441
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:55,519
and save me
a shitload of money.

442
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,270
Dad.

443
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:01,191
Everybody always
laughs at that,
but I'm not joking.

444
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,607
I'm not joking.

445
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:09,317
Anyway, I want
to thank all of you
for coming.

446
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:12,369
And here's to Doug and
my baby girl, Lillian.

447
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:14,409
Cheers!
Cheers!

448
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,036
I love you, Dad.
LILLIAN’S DAD: Enough of me.

449
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,832
Let's get the maid
of honor up here.

450
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,998
All right.
Annie?

451
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,711
Umm. Hi.
I'm Annie Walker.

452
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,170
Yay, Annie!

453
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:32,674
I'm not going to go
on with a big speech,
so I'll just say this.

454
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,219
I'm so happy to be
a part of this celebration.

455
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:38,178
And you two
deserve each other,

456
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,222
as well as
a lifetime of happiness.

457
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,648
Thank you.
- Cheers.

458
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,441
Love you guys.
GUESTS: Cheers.

459
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:44,981
Thanks, Annie.
Cheers.

460
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:50,107
Thank you, Annie.
That was so sweet.
Thank you.

461
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:54,404
Lil, remember that trip
we took to
Miami with the boys?

462
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,197
And they were
working the entire weekend,

463
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:59,875
and we just sat
and drank wine
and ate peanut brittle.

464
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:03,875
And I shared things with you
that I've never
shared with anyone.

465
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:09,176
And you made me realize
how I can trust people again.

466
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,216
So let me just say,

467
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,556
Lillian,
you are my best friend.

468
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,600
And I'm
so proud of you.

469
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:22,147
Sorry. And, Dougly...

470
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,312
I'm sorry, inside joke.

471
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,192
You better not
keep my Lil on a leash

472
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:31,148
because I still
need my drunken
Saturday nights

473
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,404
at Rockin' Sushi, okay?

474
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:39,540
Everybody raise your glasses
to the couple of the decade,

475
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:41,492
Doug and Lillian.

476
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,296
Have a great night.
Dessert wine is out.

477
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,924
Dessert wine, yummy.
Excuse me.

478
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,088
Umm...

479
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:58,513
I just wanted to
say really quick that

480
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:02,096
you are so special
to me, because...

481
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:05,149
Well, one of the reasons is
because I've known you
my whole entire life.

482
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:09,233
And you've really
helped shape who I am.

483
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:13,649
I just want to thank you
for carefully selecting me

484
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:15,484
as your maid of honor.

485
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:18,446
I know you had
some other choices,

486
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,953
but you are like my sister,
and I love you.

487
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,785
Well, that concludes
the speeches for the night.

488
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,870
Thank you.
One last thing.

489
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:30,254
It's rare to meet
someone as an adult
who you really connect with,

490
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:31,459
and that's you, Lil.

491
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:34,170
I went to Thailand recently
with my husband, Perry,

492
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:37,631
and there is
a beautiful saying
that I learned there.

493
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:47,558
It means,
"You are a part of me,

494
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,144
"a part that I could
never live without,

495
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:54,073
"and I hope and I pray
that I never have to."

496
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,372
And that's it for tonight.
Thank you for coming.

497
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:03,665
Really quick,
Thank you all for coming.

498
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,367
I just wanted to
say really quick...

499
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,119
Dessert wine is out.
Consuelo?

500
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,579
Really quick.
Speaking of Consuelo,

501
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:12,963
Lillian and I took
Spanish together in school.

502
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:16,883
And so, I would just
like to say to you,
and to everyone here...

503
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:40,778
Thank you.

504
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:43,740
Thank you.
I feel so close to you
and can trust you.

505
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:46,120
You are my
angel and soul mate.

506
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:51,376
And I feel I can
communicate with you
with simply a look.

507
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:56,300
Thank you for coming.

508
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,800
Here, I'll take that.
I'll take that.

509
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,928
Yep, I got it.

510
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,014
Lillian...

511
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:16,773
<i>Keep smiling, keep shining</i>

512
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:21,076
<i>Knowing you can</i>
<i>always count on me</i>

513
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,281
<i>For sure</i>

514
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:26,115
<i>That's what friends are for</i>

515
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,701
<i>In good times and bad times</i>

516
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:34,666
<i>I'll be on your</i>
<i>side forever more</i>

517
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,466
<i>That's what friends are for</i>

518
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,335
<i>That's what</i>
<i>friends are for</i>

519
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:53,605
Man,
engagement parties rule.

520
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:55,652
It made me feel awesome,

521
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:58,446
like I can go out
and catch another
dude to marry.

522
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:04,278
So, what's up with her,
anyway? With Helen?

523
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:06,614
What?
I'm just like...

524
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,449
I don't know.
She's in your wedding

525
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:10,705
and you've only
known her eight months,
though, right?

526
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:12,703
Come on.
Get it out,
get it all out.

527
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:18,543
I'm just...
Like, the whole gown,
and the... thing.

528
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,468
It's just weird, right?
You know what?

529
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:22,888
She's actually
really cool, Annie.

530
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:25,307
She's really...
She's a good one.
I'm telling you.

531
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:28,761
Well, I'm sure if you
like her, I will like her.

532
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:31,309
You have to just
get to know her.

533
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,186
Yeah.
Which I think
you really should.

534
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:35,108
And... Will you
just do me a favor?

535
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,685
Would you just hang
out with her once,

536
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:38,312
just the two of you.
All right?

537
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:39,988
As a favor to me.

538
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,235
Okay, I will.

539
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,491
I love you, Annie Lou.
I love you, too.

540
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:44,614
Bye.
Bye.

541
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:47,029
Oh. Hi, I'm Helen.

542
00:27:47,124 --> 00:27:49,911
You live in Milwaukee?
I'm sorry.

543
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:52,535
Have you met Lillian?
She's my best friend.

544
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,494
Yeah, I know.
We've only known each other
for five minutes.

545
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:55,830
Oh! Oh!

546
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:02,795
Oh! Cute.

547
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:06,306
No. No. Come on.

548
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,183
See? Okay?
I'm not drunk. I told you.

549
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,438
So, you are just
a terrible sober driver?

550
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:19,819
Ha ha. Very funny.
Can I stop walking now?

551
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:21,818
You can stop walking
when I tell you
to stop walking.

552
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:23,319
Hey, look.
If I was drunk,

553
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,071
would I be able to do this?

554
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:46,047
Stop it. Stop it.
Please, stop.

555
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,881
Please, stop.
I believe you.
You are not drunk.

556
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:49,717
But I'm still gonna
have to give you a ticket.

557
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,309
What? Why?

558
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:54,479
It's a funny thing
about brake lights.
You have to have them.

559
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:57,603
I knew it.
God, those have
been out for a year.

560
00:28:57,778 --> 00:28:59,393
I'm so stupid.

561
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:00,728
Look, please.

562
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,105
Please, I promise
I will get them fixed.

563
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:07,902
This week, I promise.
Please. Do you have
to give me a ticket?

564
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:12,410
Yes. License
and registration,
please.

565
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:21,047
Thanks.

566
00:29:22,803 --> 00:29:25,169
Look at that,
you live on
Wynnewood Drive.

567
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:26,629
Yep.
We are neighbors.

568
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:29,215
I just live
over on Ashley.
Ahh.

569
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,555
I used to work on Ashley.

570
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:34,807
You did? Where?

571
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:39,733
I had a bakery
on the main part
of the street there.

572
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:42,815
Oh. Cake Baby.

573
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,648
You are Cake Baby!
Yeah!

574
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,742
Yeah, you had your sign.
It was your face.

575
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:51,657
Yeah!
That was you?

576
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:52,783
That was me.

577
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,157
You made good cakes.

578
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:57,951
Thanks.

579
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:01,163
You used to make these
little pastry things,

580
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:05,001
and you'd put
something in them,
like a cream or a custard...

581
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:06,418
Cream puffs.

582
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,799
Cream puffs,
that's what you call them.
Delicious.

583
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:13,517
I used to get served
by this tall, broad guy,

584
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:15,139
with, like, a wormy face.

585
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:17,933
Yeah, that was my boyfriend.

586
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:21,475
Sorry.
No, no. It was...

587
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:24,858
He was my boyfriend,
and then he left me

588
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:28,566
when the business
went under. So, anyway...

589
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,196
You're kidding?

590
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:32,948
What a dick.

591
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,122
I'm glad
I never tipped him.

592
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,621
You know what?
Let's forget about this.

593
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,415
Let's just
forget this one.
Really?

594
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,125
Under one condition.
What? What?

595
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,335
Get your
taillights fixed...

596
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,295
I promise.
I promise I will.
I promise. Thank you.

597
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,505
...before you kill someone.

598
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:52,763
I'm not going to
kill anybody.

599
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,341
All right.
Here, there's your ID.

600
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:55,934
And I'm going
to give you this.

601
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:58,603
It's a buddy of mine.
He has a body
shop in Milwaukee.

602
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,396
He'll fix those
right up for you.

603
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:02,854
Bill Cozbi?

604
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,396
Yeah, with a "Z."

605
00:31:04,905 --> 00:31:06,645
Different guy.
Yeah.

606
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,106
And don't mention
the whole "Bill
Cosby" thing to him.

607
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:11,613
It drives him nuts.
I mean it.

608
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:14,035
Okay, I get it. Thanks.

609
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,955
You know what?
If you mention my name,
that I referred you,

610
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:18,828
he'll give you
a particularly
good deal.

611
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:21,080
My gosh. Thank you.

612
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:23,378
I really appreciate it.
Thanks.

613
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:26,081
Okay. Well,
I appreciated your cakes.

614
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:27,962
So, we are even.

615
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:30,169
That's me, there.
Rhodes. Officer Rhodes.

616
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:31,423
That's really
nice of you.

617
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:37,308
Thank you.

618
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:38,886
We are not all bad.

619
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,220
What?

620
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,725
I was just saying,
we are not all bad!

621
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:43,352
Oh. Yeah.

622
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:46,150
Actually, the rest of
them are, but not me.

623
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:47,728
I'm the best of them.

624
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:49,149
Okay. Thank you.

625
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,068
Anyway.

626
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:52,565
Thank you.

627
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,635
I didn't know
you played tennis.

628
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,641
Yeah, I played
a little in
high school.

629
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,518
I'm so glad we
were able to do this.

630
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,983
I'm really glad we
could do this, too.
It's nice we get to hang out.

631
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,276
I know, right?
Yeah.

632
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:53,274
It's too bad
Lillian couldn't play
with us today.

633
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:54,525
Poor thing, she is so busy.

634
00:33:54,658 --> 00:33:55,864
Ohh. I know.

635
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,650
But she's not really
that into sports.

636
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,280
Even when we were little,
she didn't like anything

637
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:01,737
that was too competitive.

638
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:04,827
She certainly enjoys
playing tennis now.

639
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:06,658
It's funny how
people change, isn't it?

640
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:10,037
Yeah. I mean, I don't know.
Do people really change?

641
00:34:10,674 --> 00:34:11,709
I think they do.

642
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:15,050
Yeah, but, I mean,
they still stay
who they are, pretty much.

643
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:17,719
I think we change
all the time.

644
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:22,265
I think we stay the same,
but grow,
I guess, a little bit.

645
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:24,802
I think if you are growing,
then you are changing.

646
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:28,229
But, I mean, we are changing
from who we are,
which we always stay as.

647
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:29,852
Not really,
I don't think so.

648
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:31,566
I think so.
I don't.

649
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:34,311
Annie! These are my kids.

650
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:36,237
Step-kids.
Step.

651
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:39,445
They are so hilarious.

652
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:40,658
Funny.

653
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:43,487
Excuse me,
my husband's kids.

654
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:44,988
What are
you guys up to?

655
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:46,240
Going to the snack bar.

656
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,245
Awesome. You need
a ride home later?

657
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:49,959
Fuck off, Helen.

658
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:53,585
Okay. Put a quarter
in the swear-jar.

659
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,378
Good to see you.

660
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:57,504
They are so cute.

661
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:58,717
Sweet kids.

662
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:31,959
Carol!

663
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,791
Get your shit together, Carol!

664
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:47,725
Yes!

665
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:53,689
I've seen better
tennis playing in
a tampon commercial.

666
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,145
Umm...

667
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:01,523
I've been thinking, and...

668
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:04,401
Brynn needs to start
paying rent. That's it.

669
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:05,781
She's been here
long enough.

670
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:08,830
The three of us live here,
it's not fair for
me to be paying half.

671
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,457
We split it three ways.
What do you say?

672
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:14,035
Well, she can't work.
She's on a tourist visa.

673
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,746
Yeah. So, technically,
I'm only allowed to tour.

674
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,172
Well, you know...

675
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:19,586
I have no way
of earning money,

676
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:22,294
unless I just
go and prostitute
down on the street.

677
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:24,129
I don't want you
to do that, no.

678
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:25,971
"Hello, fellas.
Here I am."

679
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:27,469
Yeah, but we...
"Put your American sausage

680
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,050
"in my English McMuffin."

681
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,260
No, we did that.
All right.

682
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:32,687
Okay, I don't even know
what you're
talking about anymore.

683
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:34,639
There's three
people living here.
Yeah.

684
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:36,645
If she doesn't
start paying...

685
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,851
I'm not.
...she has to leave.

686
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,732
Is this about
the diary again?

687
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:40,903
What diary?

688
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:43,864
Your diary proved
very interesting to read.

689
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:45,984
You read my...
You read my journal?

690
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,287
At first, I did not know
that it was your diary.

691
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:52,411
I thought it was
a very sad,
hand-written book.

692
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:55,373
What? That does not
make any...

693
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,162
But, because of
the deep personal details

694
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:59,755
and the bits that
mentioned Gil and Brynn...
- No, no, no, no.

695
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,545
Don't read my journal!
- And the crumbs.

696
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:02,876
Then...
Don't go in my room!

697
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:07,089
Well, hello! I think,
before you make
those sort of demands,

698
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,514
you need to,
maybe, think about

699
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:09,974
putting a note on
your door saying,

700
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:13,349
"Do not come into my room,
read my diary and
wear my clothes."

701
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,403
Wow, I've never been
to this part of town before.

702
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,902
Look, you can get
your checks cashed
next door.

703
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:30,453
I know it looks
a little scary
on the outside,

704
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,872
but the food
is really good,
authentic Brazilian.

705
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:35,409
I'm telling you,
this is where
Brazilians come to eat.

706
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:36,834
I got to say, Annie's
really good at this.

707
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,582
She always drags me
to the weirdest places

708
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:40,418
and the food is
always incredible.

709
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:43,375
And plus, you get
a lot for your money, too.
So that's good.

710
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:46,840
All right.
Let's do it.
Let's do it.

711
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,887
Whoa! Somebody
likes Brazilian food.

712
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:54,469
To my bridesmaids.

713
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:56,350
Cheers.
- Cheers.

714
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,522
Cheers to Lil!

715
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:02,603
This is such a stone-cold
pack of weirdos,
and I'm so proud.

716
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:04,938
And I just want to toast
all of you ladies.

717
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:06,614
I'm so happy to
get to know you guys,

718
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:09,613
and happy to say
that I have four
new friends.

719
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,490
Absolutely. Cheers.

720
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:15,536
So, Annie,
do you have a date
for the wedding?

721
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:16,657
Um...

722
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:21,420
I don't... I don't think
I'm bringing anybody,
I guess.

723
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,790
Please, can I
set you up? Please?

724
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:26,342
Annie, you can't go
to the wedding alone.
Please?

725
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:28,590
If you go alone,
people might think
you're a prostitute.

726
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:29,841
Maybe.

727
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:32,261
I'm sorry.

728
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:39,019
I hope that you're all hungry
for <i>churrasco Brasil</i>.
What would you like?

729
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:40,644
Yeah, I'll have
some of that, please.

730
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:41,815
I'll start with this.

731
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:44,394
I'd say yes.
Hello, chicken.

732
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:46,275
This is crazy
good, ya'll.

733
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,231
Helen, aren't you
eating any meat?

734
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:52,740
It's not good
to eat a big meal
before a fitting.

735
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:54,162
I feel a bit
bloated, so...

736
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:55,284
Not me.

737
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:57,582
No?
No. Physically,
I don't bloat.

738
00:38:58,503 --> 00:38:59,834
Lucky.
That is lucky.

739
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:01,915
It's a gift.

740
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:05,753
I can't wait to be married
for as long as you've been
married.

741
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:07,004
And to have kids.

742
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:11,838
And be a mom.
Becca?

743
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:14,015
Yeah?

744
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:16,263
The other night,
I'm slaving away,

745
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,470
making a beautiful
dinner for my family.

746
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:21,935
My youngest boy
comes in and says
he wants to order a pizza.

747
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,854
I said, "No, we're not
ordering pizza tonight."

748
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:26,436
He goes,
"Mom, why don't you go
and fuck yourself?"

749
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:28,279
He's nine.

750
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:31,449
Okay, now that
Lillian's in the bathroom,

751
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:33,902
I just wanted to
talk to you guys about
the shower really quick.

752
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:37,410
I was thinking it
could be French-themed,

753
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,037
since she's always wanted
to go to Paris her whole life.

754
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:44,037
So I figured we
could bring Paris here

755
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:47,207
and have champagne
and little cookies.

756
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:48,792
They'd say "Lillian
and Dougie" on them.

757
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:50,464
We can dip them in
chocolate fondue,

758
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:53,217
and get cheese from
the nice part of the store.

759
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,090
I love that.
Good idea, Annie.

760
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:57,175
We can have
French invitations,
the whole thing.

761
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,385
Don't you think
that'd be nice?

762
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,470
That's adorable!
That's really cute.

763
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:02,226
Good. Great.

764
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:03,978
I don't know.
It's really cute.

765
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,059
But I feel like,
personally, the Paris theme's

766
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,228
a bit,
"Been there, done that."

767
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,691
I just feel
like we can top it.

768
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:11,147
We should throw
some ideas around.

769
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:13,449
See if anyone else
has a theme they had in mind

770
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:15,072
or something
they'd been thinking of.

771
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:17,403
What about
a Pixar-themed shower?

772
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,410
And we all come dressed
as our favorite
Pixar character.

773
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:24,874
That, and I'll just
snowball on top of that,
also <i>Fight Club</i>.

774
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:27,584
Female fight club.

775
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,671
We grease up,
we pull in.

776
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:34,425
Lillian doesn't know,
so it's, "Surprise!
We're going to fight!"

777
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:36,180
We beat the shit out of her.

778
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,557
She's not going
to forget that.

779
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:40,676
We just fucking attack.

780
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:42,933
Can I be honest?
No.

781
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:46,187
I'm at home with
three boys all day,
every day.

782
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,608
What about
the bachelorette party?

783
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:49,106
That's what's more important.

784
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,691
I've got a new tube top,
I want to cut the tags off.

785
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:53,739
I'd like to take
advantage of this opportunity.

786
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:56,029
Where are we going?
I'm going
to second her.

787
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,735
We'd better
blow this shit out.
Yeah.

788
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:00,492
That poor girl, Lillian,
who we're all here for,

789
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:02,949
is in the bathroom
probably bawling her
fucking eyes out.

790
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:05,117
Because she's realizing,
"Holy shit!

791
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:06,953
"I've got to spend
the rest of my life
with Doug."

792
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:10,211
He's my brother. I love him.
But he is a fucking asshole.

793
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,007
I think we can all
agree on that, right?

794
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,427
We can...
We'll figure it out.

795
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:17,972
I mean, I can think of stuff,
and it will be great.

796
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:20,300
We just have to make sure
it's really, really special.

797
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:27,891
Belle en Blanc?
This is the place.
Great job, Annie.

798
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:29,647
Thanks.
Annie.

799
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,109
<i>Belle en Blanc</i>.
<i>Reservation name?</i>

800
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:38,068
I don't have one.
We're just here to shop,
just to try on some dresses.

801
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:39,823
<i>Okay. Well, the next</i>
<i>available appointment</i>

802
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:41,571
<i>for bridesmaids'</i>

803
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:43,497
<i>Absolutely no walk-ins.</i>

804
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:45,412
Whitney? It's Helen.

805
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:47,167
<i>Helen Harris?</i>
Yeah!

806
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:48,290
<i>Hi!</i>
Hi.

807
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:50,246
<i>Oh, my God. Hi. Listen,</i>
<i>I'll buzz you right in.</i>

808
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,172
Great, thanks.
<i>Okay.</i>

809
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:56,010
Hello. Welcome, come in.

810
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:57,212
You look wonderful.
Great to see you.

811
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:59,262
Welcome to Belle
en Blanc, ladies.

812
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,090
Welcome to heaven.
- Thank you.

813
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,516
Oh, man!

814
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:06,517
This is some
classy shit here.

815
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:08,268
Jesus, Megan!

816
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,849
I'm sorry,
I want to apologize.

817
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:13,232
I'm not even confident
on which end that came out of.

818
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:15,358
Whitney, back to you.
I'm sorry.

819
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:18,533
Anyway, take a look around.
Get to know the dresses.

820
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,326
If you need anything,
I'll be in my office.

821
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:21,910
Have fun.

822
00:42:21,998 --> 00:42:24,831
Oh, my God.

823
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:26,703
It's a Fritz Bernaise.

824
00:42:26,836 --> 00:42:27,951
Ladies, I...
Oh, my God!

825
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:30,458
I just don't think
we can do any better.
This is...

826
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,459
This is beautiful.
That is gorgeous.

827
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,290
It's unique,
it's special, it's couture.

828
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,091
This is made in France.

829
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,960
Helen, this is $800.

830
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:39,887
Are you kidding?
It's on sale.

831
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:42,052
Are you serious?
Oh, my gosh.
What a perfect combination.

832
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:43,553
You guys,
it was meant to be.

833
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:45,054
Oh. That's nice.

834
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:49,272
There's other dresses
we should be looking at.

835
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:51,064
Nope, not that one.

836
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:54,693
Lillian,
Lillian, look at this one.

837
00:42:54,781 --> 00:42:56,317
Isn't this pretty?
Yeah.

838
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,614
It's really pretty
and sweet, and...

839
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:02,865
We don't want to
upstage Lillian
with a big fancy dress.

840
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:04,536
Maybe we should
just get something
kind of simple.

841
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:05,654
Oh.

842
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:09,205
Please do not worry
about upstaging me.

843
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:12,287
Because guess who
Helen is friends with

844
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:15,460
and who's
designing my wedding dress.

845
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:18,338
Lady St. Petsois JuJu.

846
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:21,216
I just sent my
measurements to France, y'all.

847
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:23,260
No, you didn't.

848
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:24,841
Where were you when I
was getting married?

849
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:28,019
Ladies, let's not decide
on this bridesmaids'
dress straight away.

850
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:29,437
Let's let
our bodies decide.

851
00:43:29,774 --> 00:43:32,106
Try some things on
and have some fun, okay?

852
00:43:32,485 --> 00:43:34,396
Yeah, let's have
some fun, girls.

853
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:36,440
Ladies,
start your "engines."

854
00:43:37,198 --> 00:43:38,688
- Oh, yeah.
- Lil, Lil.

855
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:41,616
Amazing.
This is so cool.

856
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:54,041
Ladies. Ladies,
if I may interject.

857
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:56,544
I just want to say
you all look stunning.

858
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:58,378
That's a given. Head to toe.

859
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:01,461
But, sadly,
we need to agree on one.

860
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:03,922
Well, I mean, ladies,
you all look beautiful.

861
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:07,634
But I just think,
personally, the
Fritz Bernaise is just...

862
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:09,059
I mean...
It's a Bernaise.

863
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:11,559
This is
one of a kind.
I just...

864
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:12,638
I don't think
there is a question.

865
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:13,764
No. No question.

866
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,142
There might be a question.

867
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:18,068
I might...
I might have a question.

868
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:19,942
I think this
dress would look great
on everybody.

869
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:22,114
It's a great color.
It's a great length.

870
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:24,658
It's fun. You can twirl.

871
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:26,781
You can move in it.

872
00:44:26,873 --> 00:44:28,579
You can spread
your legs apart.

873
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,998
And it's a great price.

874
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:33,827
This is designer as well.

875
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:35,457
Is anyone else hot?

876
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:36,830
It is like an
oven in here.

877
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:40,083
Okay, well,
maybe this might
help you decide.

878
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:41,918
While you gals were
in the changing room,

879
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:46,382
I happened to rustle up
a two-year-old Lady
JuJu dress in storage.

880
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:48,181
I had Lillian put it
on so you could see

881
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:49,972
what you'll be
standing next to.

882
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:51,518
Lillian, honey.

883
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:53,267
My God.

884
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:56,857
Beautiful length.

885
00:44:57,028 --> 00:44:58,393
Breathtaking.

886
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:02,196
Holy shit!
You look amazing.

887
00:45:02,325 --> 00:45:03,781
That's a dress.
That dress is so pretty

888
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:04,857
it makes my stomach hurt.

889
00:45:06,996 --> 00:45:08,702
Lillian,

890
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:11,455
I don't know what to say.
You look...

891
00:45:13,586 --> 00:45:14,621
Megan, are you okay?

892
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:19,876
I think...

893
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:23,167
My dress was
probably just tight.

894
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:24,593
Oh, my God.

895
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,966
You got food poisoning
from that restaurant,
didn't you?

896
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:30,554
No, I had the same thing
that she had and I feel fine.

897
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:32,218
Oh, my... Okay.
Oh, no.

898
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:33,928
Why is this happening?
Nothing is happening.

899
00:45:35,191 --> 00:45:36,397
Oh, my God.

900
00:45:37,026 --> 00:45:38,812
I don't really care
which dress we get.

901
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:40,985
It doesn't matter to me.
I just need to get
off this white carpet.

902
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:42,482
Oh, God.
Okay. No,
not the bathroom.

903
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:45,315
Everybody go outside.
I'm serious!

904
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:47,320
There is a bathroom
across the street.

905
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:51,745
I think everybody
has the flu.

906
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:55,498
Shit!

907
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:59,040
I need the toilet!
I need the toilet!

908
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:02,794
I need the toilet!

909
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:04,375
No!

910
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:08,171
No. No, Megan.
No! No!

911
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:09,927
Look away!
Megan, no!

912
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:11,139
Look away!

913
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:18,769
You don't look
very well, Annie.

914
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:20,979
I feel fine.

915
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:25,188
Are you sure?
It wasn't that
gray kind of lamb?

916
00:46:25,283 --> 00:46:27,023
You ate a lot of
that weird chicken.

917
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:28,987
Was it that?

918
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,361
No. I'm...

919
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:32,615
I... I feel fine.

920
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:36,578
I think you'd just feel
better if you threw up.

921
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:40,627
I don't have...
I don't have to throw up.

922
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:44,336
I am so sorry.

923
00:46:44,427 --> 00:46:45,416
Get away from me!

924
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:47,380
You're not sick?

925
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:48,460
No.
No?

926
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:51,639
In fact, Helen, I'm hungry.

927
00:46:51,726 --> 00:46:53,887
And I wish I had a snack.

928
00:46:54,103 --> 00:46:55,138
You're hungry?

929
00:46:56,147 --> 00:46:57,603
I'm starving.

930
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:00,146
What did we eat?

931
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:03,396
The sink is a goner.
What are you doing?

932
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:05,148
It's coming out
of me like lava!

933
00:47:06,032 --> 00:47:07,397
Oh, my God.

934
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:08,898
Don't you
fucking look at me!

935
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:12,318
Hmm?

936
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:13,819
Jordan almonds.

937
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:15,237
These are great.

938
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,331
Thank you.

939
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,051
Better?

940
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:31,507
I was...
I was just hungry.

941
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:32,880
Yeah.

942
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:36,551
Annie, everybody
is really sick
from that restaurant.

943
00:47:38,314 --> 00:47:39,895
But it wasn't
the restaurant.
No, no, no, no.

944
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:41,392
Lillian,
where are you going?
No.

945
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:42,519
I need a bathroom.

946
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:44,562
Lil!

947
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:45,608
No. No.

948
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:46,776
Lil, where are you going?

949
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,526
Be careful.
What are you doing

950
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:54,026
It's happening.
It's happening.

951
00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:58,914
It happened.
- What are you doing?

952
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:00,366
It happened.

953
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:04,082
No. Don't you
dare ruin that dress!

954
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:06,585
Ohh. You're really
doing it, aren't you?

955
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,298
You're really
shitting in the street.

956
00:48:18,646 --> 00:48:20,386
We'll just take five
of the Fritz Bernaises.

957
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:22,096
Thank you, Whitney.
They really do look better.

958
00:48:22,191 --> 00:48:23,852
Right.
Thank you.

959
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:29,319
You okay?

960
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:34,320
I crapped
my wedding dress.
I crapped...

961
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:38,121
I... I crapped
my wedding dress.

962
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,249
Lunch was fun,
though, right?

963
00:48:43,379 --> 00:48:44,994
It was a good time,
all the girls together.

964
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:47,000
Is this a sign, Annie?

965
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:48,421
No. I'm just
going to pull over

966
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:50,295
really quick,
though, because...

967
00:48:50,386 --> 00:48:51,375
What?

968
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:52,585
...my tire just
feels a little...

969
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:53,760
Where are you going?

970
00:48:53,848 --> 00:48:54,928
My tire just feels
a little low.

971
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,926
I just want to check
my tire real quick.

972
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:26,706
Oh. Could I borrow
your razor, please?

973
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:32,166
Thank you.
Mmm-hmm.

974
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:33,592
Have a good date.
Thank you.

975
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:37,009
Is the guy that
you're going out
with also over 40?

976
00:49:37,141 --> 00:49:39,052
I'm not over 40.
Forget it.

977
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:41,808
Lift up your arm.
Point up.

978
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:45,354
Ow!
Sorry.

979
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:57,441
Hi.
Annie.

980
00:49:57,745 --> 00:49:59,235
Pete?
Yeah.

981
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:00,360
Come on in.

982
00:50:00,456 --> 00:50:01,445
All right. Thank you.

983
00:50:04,627 --> 00:50:06,834
Oh. This is
my son, Tyler.

984
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:08,994
Hi, Tyler.
Hi.

985
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:11,835
These things are
always so awkward.
Yeah.

986
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:13,791
I'm not really a setup guy.
Me, either.

987
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:15,422
But Becca spoke
so highly of you.

988
00:50:16,222 --> 00:50:18,258
She had a lot of
really nice things
to say about you, too.

989
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:19,429
That's nice to hear.

990
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:22,216
I'm going to go upstairs,
throw on a couple
of finishing touches.

991
00:50:23,312 --> 00:50:26,145
The babysitter's not here yet,
so just hang out with Tyler

992
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:27,479
and I'll be
right back down.
Okay.

993
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:28,555
Okay.

994
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,489
So, how old are you?

995
00:50:45,668 --> 00:50:47,374
Do you watch movies?

996
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:55,799
Are you afraid of dying?

997
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:56,875
Hmm?

998
00:50:56,971 --> 00:50:59,212
Are you afraid of dying?

999
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:00,963
Um...

1000
00:51:02,268 --> 00:51:04,133
I don't know.

1001
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:08,975
I mean,
I guess everybody is.
I don't know. Why?

1002
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:12,107
Because my mom is
going to kill you.

1003
00:51:22,705 --> 00:51:24,821
You're making me
uncomfortable.

1004
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:32,582
Your hair looks burned.

1005
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,789
Okay.

1006
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:40,632
Are you going to make
a baby with my father?

1007
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,591
I don't...
I don't know.

1008
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:47,889
My grandma died
where you're sitting.

1009
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:50,645
She died right here?

1010
00:51:51,984 --> 00:51:54,316
Right where your
underpants are.

1011
00:52:01,994 --> 00:52:03,655
You wanna
watch me dance?

1012
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:06,194
Sure.

1013
00:52:26,644 --> 00:52:28,384
I can't do this.

1014
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:31,891
Listen to me.
I miss you so much.

1015
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:34,143
I'll come over right now.

1016
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:36,350
Okay, I'm not over
you yet, that's why.

1017
00:52:36,445 --> 00:52:38,060
She's not even pretty.

1018
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:41,438
I'm not doing it.
I can't. No.

1019
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:51,661
What are you doing?
Did you eat one of those?

1020
00:52:51,752 --> 00:52:53,834
Did you eat
one of those?

1021
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:55,627
I ate Saturday.

1022
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:58,084
Okay. Oh, boy.
You know what?

1023
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:00,791
Something's going
to happen to you.
I don't know what it is,

1024
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:03,753
but something's
going to happen
to your body.

1025
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:10,141
That was fun.
Oh, my gosh.

1026
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:15,560
You know what I was thinking?

1027
00:53:15,651 --> 00:53:18,393
You should come with me
to Lillian's wedding, maybe.

1028
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,818
Not like that.
Not like anything serious.

1029
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:22,737
But just like
a fun time, you know?

1030
00:53:22,825 --> 00:53:27,410
We can get dressed up,
and we can go
dancing and have a drink.

1031
00:53:27,496 --> 00:53:28,781
It'll be fun, right?

1032
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:32,164
No. I mean,
I don't want to make
you have to explain

1033
00:53:32,251 --> 00:53:35,038
to all those people
what our relationship is.

1034
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:38,954
That would suck for you.
Right?

1035
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:41,256
Yeah. I guess so.

1036
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:43,250
I'm just thinking of you.
Yeah.

1037
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:45,927
No, it's okay.

1038
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:49,302
I have someone else
I can ask, anyway. So...

1039
00:53:50,811 --> 00:53:52,347
Really?
Yeah.

1040
00:53:52,438 --> 00:53:53,644
Who?

1041
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:55,012
Umm...
This guy, George.

1042
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:58,269
George Glass.

1043
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:02,735
Okay.

1044
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:06,815
Who is this George?

1045
00:54:07,536 --> 00:54:11,449
He is a very hot, nice guy

1046
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:15,032
who likes me a lot,
and would probably
love to be my date.

1047
00:54:15,127 --> 00:54:16,116
Really?
Mmm-hmm.

1048
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:17,200
Mmm-hmm.

1049
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:24,132
Well, let me ask you this.

1050
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:28,087
Can this George Glass

1051
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:32,049
do this to you?

1052
00:54:42,905 --> 00:54:44,236
Probably.

1053
00:54:45,032 --> 00:54:47,819
You know what?
It's getting really late.

1054
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:51,368
You should probably go.
I'm going to miss you so much.

1055
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:12,422
Oh.

1056
00:55:15,604 --> 00:55:16,593
Annie Walker.

1057
00:55:16,772 --> 00:55:17,761
Hi.

1058
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:19,096
Hey.
Hey.

1059
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:21,599
What brings you
in here so early?

1060
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:24,776
I've just had a bad night.
Boy stuff.
Ohh.

1061
00:55:25,948 --> 00:55:27,529
Do you want me
to arrest anybody?

1062
00:55:27,616 --> 00:55:28,605
I could do that.

1063
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:29,731
Actually... No.

1064
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:33,194
Do you want to talk
to a cop about it?
We are just like priests.

1065
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:36,989
Except we can
tell everybody
about it afterwards.

1066
00:55:37,084 --> 00:55:38,119
Oh.
I won't, though.

1067
00:55:38,627 --> 00:55:39,833
Doesn't sound very inviting.

1068
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:42,623
You want a carrot?

1069
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:45,876
Right now?
Yeah.

1070
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:48,629
I'll share.
I've got plenty.

1071
00:55:49,638 --> 00:55:50,753
Sure, I'll have a carrot.

1072
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:51,969
Yeah?

1073
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:53,297
Okay.

1074
00:55:53,976 --> 00:55:55,932
Ohh. Yeah,
that sounds rough.

1075
00:55:57,271 --> 00:55:58,351
It's going to
get better, right?

1076
00:55:58,438 --> 00:55:59,427
I wouldn't have
thought so.

1077
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:02,560
You know, my sister
was a maid of honor
at our cousin's wedding,

1078
00:56:02,651 --> 00:56:06,235
and she found it so stressful,
her hair started falling out.

1079
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:08,228
That's terrible.
Yeah.

1080
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:10,439
It grew back,
but it was...

1081
00:56:10,951 --> 00:56:12,441
It was pretty gross.

1082
00:56:12,995 --> 00:56:14,326
Planning a wedding
should be fun.

1083
00:56:14,413 --> 00:56:17,075
You know what?
If I ever had a wedding,

1084
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,869
I'd want everybody
to be stress-free.

1085
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,666
I'd like it to be
like a carnival.

1086
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:26,213
Like, people win prizes
for guessing
the bride's weight.

1087
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:27,631
Dunk tanks.

1088
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:28,833
Yeah.
You know?

1089
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:30,591
Mmm-hmm.
You could have elephants,

1090
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:33,011
and the bride and groom
can walk on
a little tightrope.

1091
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:35,931
Okay, what you are
talking about there,
that's a circus wedding.

1092
00:56:36,018 --> 00:56:37,633
It's a totally different...
Right.

1093
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:39,138
You missed it.
Yeah.

1094
00:56:40,022 --> 00:56:43,105
Hey, you know,
instead of stressing
out about this wedding,

1095
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:45,773
you know what you
should be doing?

1096
00:56:45,861 --> 00:56:47,817
Setting up a new bakery!

1097
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:49,644
Hmm.

1098
00:56:50,908 --> 00:56:52,273
No, I'm kind of
done with that.

1099
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:53,945
What?

1100
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:56,485
I don't do it anymore.

1101
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:58,161
All right.

1102
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:02,157
Ew.
Oh!

1103
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:03,750
You got the ugly carrot.
What?

1104
00:57:04,463 --> 00:57:06,454
There is one in every bag.
You have to eat it.
It's good luck.

1105
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:07,663
I'm not eating this.

1106
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:08,879
Yeah! I'll eat it.

1107
00:57:09,051 --> 00:57:11,383
It's the lucky carrot?
No, don't eat it!
Don't eat it. Don't eat it!

1108
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:16,551
Well, don't litter!
I'll fine you.
I'm sorry.

1109
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:18,595
You know what?
Actually,
I'm going to pick it up.

1110
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:19,970
It really bothers me.
Sorry.

1111
00:57:20,062 --> 00:57:24,226
I'm sorry.
It's just that I'm anal
about that kind of thing.

1112
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:32,738
I didn't know that
you could be a cop here
if you weren't a citizen.

1113
00:57:33,659 --> 00:57:34,739
You can't.
No?

1114
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:36,657
No. No, you can't.

1115
00:57:36,745 --> 00:57:38,656
But they made
a special dispensation

1116
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:40,700
because I'm so
tough and strong.

1117
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:42,247
Oh. Right.
And handsome.

1118
00:57:42,334 --> 00:57:43,619
Okay.

1119
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:45,246
You're pretty...
You're pretty tough.

1120
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:48,332
I am tough.
You're tough.
You're a tough cop.

1121
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:49,583
Look. You're saying it,
but you're laughing.

1122
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:50,831
No, you're...
You're...

1123
00:57:50,926 --> 00:57:52,132
You didn't let
me flex that time.

1124
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:53,466
That was unfair.
I'm really tough.

1125
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:55,510
So am I.
No.

1126
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:57,838
Yeah. I could be a cop.

1127
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:01,012
You think
you could be a cop?
Yeah.

1128
00:58:01,103 --> 00:58:02,092
Okay.
Yeah.

1129
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:04,018
Let's see.
You know what?

1130
00:58:04,106 --> 00:58:07,189
The sun is nearly up.
Let's go and see if
you've got what it takes.

1131
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:10,141
That's right.
Now, plant your feet.

1132
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:11,267
Okay.

1133
00:58:11,363 --> 00:58:12,398
Good.

1134
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:14,521
And take aim.

1135
00:58:16,118 --> 00:58:19,451
Now, put your left
hand behind your head.

1136
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:22,328
Yeah. And just
drop your left hip.

1137
00:58:26,003 --> 00:58:27,994
I'm kidding. Put your
arms out straight.
Okay.

1138
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:30,328
You want to hit the middle
of the license plate.

1139
00:58:30,424 --> 00:58:31,880
That's where you get
the most accurate reading.

1140
00:58:31,967 --> 00:58:34,049
Okay.
Okay, here we go.
You ready?

1141
00:58:34,136 --> 00:58:35,171
Okay.

1142
00:58:36,805 --> 00:58:39,672
Fifty-eight.
What's the speed limit?

1143
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:40,972
Fifty-five.

1144
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:43,721
Okay, they were all right.
We'll let them go.

1145
00:58:43,812 --> 00:58:46,428
You were born
to do this.
Look at you.

1146
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:48,722
Okay.
All right,
here we go.

1147
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:52,309
Sixty-three.

1148
00:58:52,696 --> 00:58:54,152
You are missing
some good ones here.

1149
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:57,527
People are on
their way to work.
Why ruin their day?

1150
00:58:58,201 --> 00:58:59,691
Okay, watch this. 48.

1151
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:02,485
Forty-eight.
How did you do that?

1152
00:59:02,581 --> 00:59:03,741
It wasn't!
Yes, it was.

1153
00:59:03,832 --> 00:59:05,242
That's never happened.
Are you serious?

1154
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:06,743
It was 48?
Yes, 48!

1155
00:59:06,835 --> 00:59:08,496
Yeah.
I'm so impressed.

1156
00:59:08,587 --> 00:59:09,747
I'm pretty impressive.

1157
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:11,794
I'm very impressed by you.

1158
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:13,663
Whoa!

1159
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:14,914
Whoa!

1160
00:59:15,135 --> 00:59:16,591
Whoa!
Damn!

1161
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:18,547
That was 91.
91?

1162
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:19,627
Yes. Can we go?

1163
00:59:19,723 --> 00:59:20,712
We can go.

1164
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:22,968
Come on, hot dogger.

1165
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:26,513
Let's get that fucker.

1166
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:27,848
Oh, my God!

1167
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,305
Oh, my God!

1168
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:42,826
...family lake house. Perfect.

1169
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:54,667
Hello?
I just got your e-mail.
Lake house?

1170
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:57,131
Yeah.

1171
00:59:57,219 --> 00:59:59,551
Yeah, it's
Lillian's parents' house.

1172
00:59:59,638 --> 01:00:02,175
We used to go there
all the time in the
summers and everything.

1173
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:04,798
<i>It's one of...</i>
A bachelorette in a cabin?

1174
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:07,304
Wait. Can you...
Hold that thought. Hold on.

1175
01:00:07,395 --> 01:00:08,430
Hello?

1176
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:10,846
Fucking Helen. Hello?

1177
01:00:11,191 --> 01:00:12,806
Annie, it's Rita.

1178
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:14,141
Hi.

1179
01:00:14,236 --> 01:00:17,478
Listen, I need a trip
that I can fantasize forever

1180
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:19,528
so that I am able to
have sex with my husband.

1181
01:00:19,658 --> 01:00:21,740
<i>That's why</i>
<i>I'm thinking Vegas.</i>

1182
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:23,612
Vegas?

1183
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:24,692
Hang on. Hey!

1184
01:00:24,913 --> 01:00:27,370
<i>Shut your filthy</i>
<i>fucking mouths! I'm sorry.</i>

1185
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:28,867
I'm surrounded by savages.

1186
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:31,908
You know what?
I should probably run.
My other line is ringing.

1187
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:34,244
You know, I can get cocaine
from my hairdresser.

1188
01:00:34,506 --> 01:00:36,838
Okay, bye. Hello?

1189
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:38,210
Annie.
Yeah?

1190
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:41,426
I'm so excited.
Helen just called.
She said we can go to Vegas.

1191
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:44,513
You know...
Yeah, but we have to...
We have to fly there, and...

1192
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:47,762
Okay, Annie, I know
you are afraid of flying,

1193
01:00:47,853 --> 01:00:50,845
<i>but I want to see Criss Angel,</i>
<i>but I'm scared.</i>

1194
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:52,971
Which I sort of love.

1195
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:54,681
Can you just hold on
for one second?

1196
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:56,983
<i>Oh, sure, sure, sure. I...</i>
Thanks. Hold on.
God damn it.

1197
01:00:57,154 --> 01:00:59,110
<i>Hello?</i>
Hey, Annie, it's Megan.

1198
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:00,186
Hey.

1199
01:01:00,282 --> 01:01:02,648
I just had some thoughts
about the bachelorette party.

1200
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:04,365
<i>Okay, here we go.</i>

1201
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:05,984
Easy-peasy. Vegas it is.

1202
01:01:07,164 --> 01:01:08,199
Helen called you,
didn't she?

1203
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:09,946
Yeah, she got the jump on you.

1204
01:01:11,376 --> 01:01:13,412
I want balls in my face.

1205
01:01:13,587 --> 01:01:14,827
Honestly, I think it's Vegas.

1206
01:01:14,963 --> 01:01:16,874
I love puppets.
Balls.

1207
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:18,295
I guess we are undecided.

1208
01:01:48,288 --> 01:01:50,324
I feel so bad Annie's
stuck back in coach.

1209
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:51,829
I know, I offered
to pay for her

1210
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,365
so she could sit
in first class,

1211
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:55,621
but she said no.

1212
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:56,827
She's too proud.

1213
01:01:56,922 --> 01:01:58,503
It was nice of you to offer.

1214
01:02:01,301 --> 01:02:02,381
No carry-on, huh?

1215
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:04,960
No.
Yeah, I noticed.

1216
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:07,421
I noticed you
didn't put anything
in the overhead bin either.

1217
01:02:07,515 --> 01:02:08,504
And I get it.

1218
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:12,183
I get it. I want you to know,
protect and serve

1219
01:02:12,354 --> 01:02:13,810
Air Marshal-style.

1220
01:02:14,356 --> 01:02:15,471
What?

1221
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:17,556
I don't want to
infringe on your privacy, man.

1222
01:02:17,651 --> 01:02:20,017
I just... I really appreciate
what you do for this country.

1223
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:22,435
And I respect
the hell out of you.

1224
01:02:24,532 --> 01:02:25,612
That's great.

1225
01:02:26,243 --> 01:02:28,404
I'm not an Air Marshal.
I'm going to take a nap.

1226
01:02:28,495 --> 01:02:29,575
Awesome.
Cool.

1227
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:32,070
I'll take the first watch.

1228
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:35,873
I'm not an Air Marshal.
You don't need
to take a watch.

1229
01:02:35,961 --> 01:02:37,167
Okay.

1230
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:40,245
I've got the first watch.

1231
01:02:40,507 --> 01:02:41,792
<i>Please check</i>
<i>your seatbelts</i>

1232
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:44,044
<i>and that your seat backs</i>
<i>are in an upright</i>
<i>position before takeoff.</i>

1233
01:02:44,135 --> 01:02:45,170
Gosh.

1234
01:02:46,638 --> 01:02:48,674
I am really hoping
this flight is quick,

1235
01:02:48,807 --> 01:02:50,798
and we get there on
the ground safely.

1236
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:51,972
I'm not a good flyer,
I'm sorry.

1237
01:02:52,352 --> 01:02:55,219
I had a dream last
night that we went down.

1238
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:58,100
Yep. It was terrible.
You were in it.

1239
01:02:58,233 --> 01:03:00,690
What?
It sounds like
something's happening.

1240
01:03:10,245 --> 01:03:11,610
Annie, what are you
doing up here?

1241
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:13,111
You are supposed
to be in your seat.

1242
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:14,537
I know.
I'm freaking out
a little bit.

1243
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:17,457
Ma'am, we're still ascending.
You're gonna need to
return to your seat.

1244
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:18,867
Okay, I was just...

1245
01:03:18,962 --> 01:03:21,954
Annie, I have something.

1246
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:24,706
Take two, you'll fall asleep,
wake up and we'll be there.
Here.

1247
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:28,756
Ma'am, you're going
to have to return to
your seat, please.

1248
01:03:28,972 --> 01:03:30,428
It's fine.
Okay. All right.

1249
01:03:30,515 --> 01:03:32,506
Ma'am!
All right. All right.

1250
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:36,969
Oh, my God, I feel terrible.
I should be sitting
back there with her.

1251
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:39,975
I shouldn't be up
here in first class.
I feel like such a jerk.

1252
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:41,977
Lil, this is
your weekend, okay?

1253
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:44,066
You are
treating yourself.
Just relax.

1254
01:03:44,279 --> 01:03:45,815
She will be fine.
She will make friends.

1255
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:48,021
There is much more sense
of community in coach,
I promise you.

1256
01:03:48,116 --> 01:03:49,196
She'll be fine.

1257
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:55,286
I can't believe
you've never been
with anybody else.

1258
01:03:56,207 --> 01:03:57,367
Just Kevin.

1259
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,376
I'm sorry. I just...

1260
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:05,042
Becca, I just can't
help but feel bad for you.

1261
01:04:05,467 --> 01:04:07,799
You don't even
know what you want.

1262
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:09,800
I got to know where
you keep the gun, man.

1263
01:04:10,055 --> 01:04:12,421
I mean, is it ankle,
hip, lower back?

1264
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:15,256
You don't...
Between the cheeks, do you?

1265
01:04:15,352 --> 01:04:20,346
No, I don't stick
a gun up my butt.
That's stupid.

1266
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:21,555
I didn't say "up."

1267
01:04:21,816 --> 01:04:25,400
I just knew of a guy,
that guy did a lot
of undercover work.

1268
01:04:25,653 --> 01:04:29,566
And all I know is
he had tape marks
all up and down his cheeks.

1269
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:31,568
That can't be true.

1270
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:33,942
People don't keep
guns up their asses

1271
01:04:34,037 --> 01:04:36,494
because if you
needed to use it,
how are you going to get it?

1272
01:04:36,664 --> 01:04:38,074
He cut a hole in his pocket.

1273
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:40,080
What?
In his back pocket.

1274
01:04:40,502 --> 01:04:41,787
You have got to get
something out of your ass

1275
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:43,914
and you cut a hole in
the back of your jeans,

1276
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:45,870
you want to tell me
you can't get to something?

1277
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:49,586
I don't have a gun
for you to put up my ass
to make your point.

1278
01:04:49,677 --> 01:04:51,793
I can put my Nano.
I will show you.

1279
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:53,298
I will...
If you get me scissors,

1280
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:54,841
I will cut
a hole in my pocket.

1281
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:59,218
And you will
never find this again
until I want you to find it.

1282
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:04,940
Kevin can only have sex
in bed, in the dark,
under the covers,

1283
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:06,357
only after
we have showered

1284
01:05:06,945 --> 01:05:08,355
separately.

1285
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:11,529
And sometimes,
by the time
we are finished

1286
01:05:11,658 --> 01:05:13,740
cleaning ourselves,
he's too tired.

1287
01:05:14,661 --> 01:05:19,371
And then I pretend I'm tired,
but I'm not tired.
I'm not tired. I'm not tired.

1288
01:05:19,541 --> 01:05:22,533
That's why every girl needs
those slutty college years.

1289
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:26,328
To experiment,
get it out of your system,
find out what you like.

1290
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:30,381
Excuse me, could I
have a glass of alcohol
when you get a chance?

1291
01:05:31,302 --> 01:05:34,169
Two double
Seven and Sevens.

1292
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:36,546
Is that...

1293
01:05:36,724 --> 01:05:38,885
You will like it.
It's sweet.

1294
01:05:39,561 --> 01:05:40,550
I have to go
to the bathroom.

1295
01:05:40,728 --> 01:05:43,686
But I heard about
a woman who went to
the bathroom on a plane.

1296
01:05:43,857 --> 01:05:45,893
She got sucked
into the toilet.

1297
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:48,516
Sucked right in.

1298
01:05:51,656 --> 01:05:52,771
Are you okay?

1299
01:05:52,907 --> 01:05:54,067
Yes.

1300
01:05:54,242 --> 01:05:57,734
Yeah, I just think
that what you gave me
didn't really do anything.

1301
01:05:57,912 --> 01:06:01,404
I just have too much adrenalin
or something. But, thanks.

1302
01:06:02,167 --> 01:06:04,829
Why don't you take
my scotch?

1303
01:06:05,003 --> 01:06:07,915
It will just give the pill
a little kick that it needs.

1304
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:09,750
Honestly,
I do it all the time.
Yeah?

1305
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:12,381
Yeah, and I'm much
smaller than you,
so you'll handle it.

1306
01:06:13,595 --> 01:06:14,584
Well, thanks.

1307
01:06:14,762 --> 01:06:16,218
Yeah?
Okay.

1308
01:06:29,736 --> 01:06:30,816
Yummy?

1309
01:06:30,945 --> 01:06:32,105
Yeah, it's good.

1310
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:34,396
You should just toss it back.
Don't waste any more time.

1311
01:06:34,574 --> 01:06:35,609
Okay.

1312
01:06:40,455 --> 01:06:41,615
Ohh. Look at that.

1313
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:47,079
Okay, that'll do it.
That'll do it.

1314
01:06:47,545 --> 01:06:49,251
So you don't even
have sex anymore?

1315
01:06:49,422 --> 01:06:51,754
No, I have sex constantly.

1316
01:06:52,050 --> 01:06:53,381
The sex is constant.

1317
01:06:53,551 --> 01:06:56,213
But he hasn't
kissed me in five years.

1318
01:06:56,387 --> 01:06:57,797
What are you doing
when you are
having sex, then?

1319
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:01,806
Thinking about other things
and wishing it would stop.

1320
01:07:02,602 --> 01:07:04,558
You know, sometimes
I just want to watch

1321
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:06,643
<i>The Daily Show</i>
without him entering me.

1322
01:07:07,649 --> 01:07:10,061
It's the Wet
Republic Ultra Pool.
No.

1323
01:07:10,235 --> 01:07:11,395
Are you kidding?

1324
01:07:11,402 --> 01:07:12,733
What is it again?

1325
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:14,481
There is a bar in
the pool and a tiger.

1326
01:07:14,614 --> 01:07:16,275
What?

1327
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:18,280
It's crazy.
It's Vegas at its best.

1328
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:21,989
Wait a minute.
Is this that place
that was on <i>The Real World?</i>

1329
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:24,779
Are you kidding me?
Oh, my God. It's...

1330
01:07:24,958 --> 01:07:27,415
Hey, buddy.
How you doing?

1331
01:07:27,585 --> 01:07:31,498
I'm good.
I'm so much more relaxed.
Thank you, Helen.

1332
01:07:31,673 --> 01:07:36,167
I just feel like
I'm excited,
and I feel relaxed.

1333
01:07:36,344 --> 01:07:38,460
And I'm ready

1334
01:07:38,638 --> 01:07:42,256
to party

1335
01:07:42,433 --> 01:07:45,675
with the best of them!

1336
01:07:45,853 --> 01:07:50,267
<i>And I'm going to</i>
<i>go down to the river</i>

1337
01:07:50,441 --> 01:07:55,185
Wow! It looks like somebody
is really relaxing now.

1338
01:07:55,530 --> 01:07:58,522
What are you guys
talking about up here?

1339
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:01,362
We are going to
a restaurant tonight.
I know the owner, so...

1340
01:08:01,536 --> 01:08:03,026
You do?

1341
01:08:04,872 --> 01:08:06,988
Ohh. Helen knows the owner.

1342
01:08:08,042 --> 01:08:09,031
Uhh!

1343
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:12,372
Big whoop.

1344
01:08:12,547 --> 01:08:14,538
Let's go take a nap.
What do you say?

1345
01:08:14,716 --> 01:08:16,707
Miss, you cannot be up here.

1346
01:08:16,884 --> 01:08:19,216
Hello, grandpa.

1347
01:08:20,305 --> 01:08:22,091
I'm sorry.
I just want
to be here with

1348
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:24,054
my friends,
because I'm
with this group.

1349
01:08:24,225 --> 01:08:27,058
The sign just went off.
Can't she stay up here
for a minute and just talk?

1350
01:08:27,228 --> 01:08:28,217
Absolutely not.

1351
01:08:28,396 --> 01:08:30,352
Coach passengers
are not allowed
up here in first class.

1352
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:31,854
It's policy.
I'm sorry.

1353
01:08:32,066 --> 01:08:33,055
Ooh!

1354
01:08:33,234 --> 01:08:37,523
This is a very
strict plane
that I'm on.

1355
01:08:37,697 --> 01:08:39,358
Welcome to Germany.

1356
01:08:40,908 --> 01:08:44,571
<i>Auf Wiedersehen,</i> asshole.

1357
01:08:44,746 --> 01:08:45,735
All right.

1358
01:08:45,913 --> 01:08:46,902
Why don't you go lay down?

1359
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:49,413
I'm going to go take a nap.
I'm tired.

1360
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:50,577
I think it's a good idea.

1361
01:08:50,752 --> 01:08:53,915
Catch you on the flip side,
motherfuckers.

1362
01:08:55,048 --> 01:08:56,003
I'm sorry.

1363
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:57,170
I'm leaving.

1364
01:08:57,258 --> 01:08:58,293
Thank you.

1365
01:08:59,677 --> 01:09:02,043
This should be open,
because it's civil rights.

1366
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:03,506
This is the '90s.

1367
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:06,673
Right. It's not.
You're in the wrong decade.

1368
01:09:06,851 --> 01:09:08,557
You are.
Okay, I am.

1369
01:09:08,728 --> 01:09:09,763
Thank you.

1370
01:09:10,104 --> 01:09:12,561
Holy shit.
What did you give her?

1371
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:32,160
Miss?

1372
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:36,036
No. It's not me.

1373
01:09:36,214 --> 01:09:38,580
Yes, it is you.
Please go back
to your seat.

1374
01:09:38,758 --> 01:09:40,794
Yes, I am with him.

1375
01:09:40,968 --> 01:09:43,300
I am Mrs. Iglesias.

1376
01:09:43,471 --> 01:09:44,460
No, you are not.

1377
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:47,384
You were just out here
and you put sunglasses on.
Out.

1378
01:09:47,809 --> 01:09:48,798
But I don't want to.

1379
01:09:48,935 --> 01:09:51,301
Sir, she can
have my seat, okay?

1380
01:09:51,396 --> 01:09:53,557
Everyone should
experience first class
at least once in their lives.

1381
01:09:53,648 --> 01:09:55,934
And Annie shouldn't
miss out just because
she can't afford it.

1382
01:09:56,109 --> 01:09:57,645
No, ma'am, I'm
afraid that's not allowed.

1383
01:09:57,819 --> 01:09:59,775
Help me, I'm poor.
- No, listen,

1384
01:09:59,946 --> 01:10:02,653
we're a whole wedding party.
I'm the bride.
I'm getting married.

1385
01:10:02,824 --> 01:10:05,657
This seat is empty.
She's obviously nervous.
We'll calm her down and...

1386
01:10:05,827 --> 01:10:07,488
I understand.
But Claire is right.

1387
01:10:07,662 --> 01:10:08,993
Everybody,
go back to your seats.

1388
01:10:09,163 --> 01:10:10,653
Okay, you especially.

1389
01:10:10,832 --> 01:10:12,788
You have three seconds
to get back to your seat.

1390
01:10:14,001 --> 01:10:16,083
You can't get
anywhere in three seconds.

1391
01:10:16,254 --> 01:10:17,334
Well, you'd better try.

1392
01:10:17,505 --> 01:10:18,870
You are setting me
up for a loss already.

1393
01:10:18,965 --> 01:10:20,000
Thank you.

1394
01:10:21,175 --> 01:10:23,666
Whatever you say, Stove.

1395
01:10:23,845 --> 01:10:25,176
It's Steve.

1396
01:10:26,514 --> 01:10:28,300
"Stove."
What kind of name is that?

1397
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:30,305
That's not a name.
My name is Steve.

1398
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:31,682
Are you an appliance?

1399
01:10:31,853 --> 01:10:33,684
No, I'm a man,
and my name is Steve.

1400
01:10:33,855 --> 01:10:35,186
You are a flight attendant.

1401
01:10:35,356 --> 01:10:38,018
That's absolutely
accurate.

1402
01:10:39,861 --> 01:10:42,193
You can close that.
Thank you.

1403
01:10:46,701 --> 01:10:48,362
Hey, not-Air Marshall Jon.

1404
01:10:48,536 --> 01:10:51,152
You want to get
back in that restroom
and not rest?

1405
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:53,195
No, I have to get
back to my seat.

1406
01:10:53,374 --> 01:10:55,990
Yeah, you gotta
get back on my seat.

1407
01:10:58,045 --> 01:10:59,034
You get it?

1408
01:10:59,213 --> 01:11:00,703
Yeah,
I definitely
got it.

1409
01:11:00,882 --> 01:11:02,372
Oh-oh. What's that?

1410
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:07,377
I got to get back to my seat.
Could you just
move your leg, please?

1411
01:11:07,555 --> 01:11:09,045
I got to go.

1412
01:11:09,348 --> 01:11:11,304
Oh-oh.
Oh-oh.

1413
01:11:11,392 --> 01:11:13,553
Somebody found a souvenir.

1414
01:11:14,061 --> 01:11:17,724
You feel that
steam heat coming?
That's from my undercarriage.

1415
01:11:18,065 --> 01:11:20,272
That can go up
and higher.

1416
01:11:20,443 --> 01:11:21,853
Okay.

1417
01:11:23,613 --> 01:11:25,399
Jon, get us a blanket.

1418
01:11:25,573 --> 01:11:26,904
No.

1419
01:11:27,074 --> 01:11:29,736
I got to take a whiz
and I'll be right back.

1420
01:11:30,745 --> 01:11:31,780
Cool.

1421
01:11:34,081 --> 01:11:37,790
I don't want you to be
a big fuck-up like me.

1422
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:39,291
How do you think I feel?

1423
01:11:39,462 --> 01:11:42,078
Like me.
You can still
turn it around.

1424
01:11:42,256 --> 01:11:43,621
No, don't.

1425
01:11:44,926 --> 01:11:46,086
Stop it!

1426
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:48,967
You are more
beautiful than
Cinderella.

1427
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:53,427
You smell like
pine needles and you
have a face like sunshine.

1428
01:12:06,948 --> 01:12:08,108
What?

1429
01:12:11,244 --> 01:12:12,404
Oh, no.

1430
01:12:13,621 --> 01:12:14,986
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1431
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:18,327
<i>as you can see,</i>
<i>the captain has turned on</i>
<i>the "fasten seatbelt" sign.</i>

1432
01:12:18,501 --> 01:12:20,583
<i>It appears we've run into</i>
<i>a rough patch of weather...</i>

1433
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:21,910
<i>I have an announcement, too.</i>

1434
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:23,960
<i>There is a Colonial woman</i>
<i>on the wing.</i>

1435
01:12:24,048 --> 01:12:25,413
<i>There's a woman on the wing.</i>
<i>I saw her.</i>

1436
01:12:25,550 --> 01:12:26,915
<i>There's something</i>
<i>they're not telling us!</i>

1437
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:28,044
Steve.
All right.

1438
01:12:28,135 --> 01:12:29,250
<i>There's a Colonial woman.</i>

1439
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:31,051
<i>She was churning</i>
<i>butter on that wing.</i>
Steve, get her.

1440
01:12:31,138 --> 01:12:32,628
<i>She is out there right now.</i>
Shit!

1441
01:12:32,807 --> 01:12:35,093
Everyone, remain calm!
I'm an Air Marshal.

1442
01:12:35,977 --> 01:12:38,639
Yes! I knew it.
I got your back, Jon!

1443
01:12:38,729 --> 01:12:40,139
<i>There is a woman on the wing.</i>
<i>I saw her.</i>

1444
01:12:40,314 --> 01:12:41,724
<i>There's something</i>
<i>they're not telling us.</i>

1445
01:12:41,816 --> 01:12:43,772
Let's get out!
Let's open the doors
and get out!

1446
01:12:43,943 --> 01:12:46,525
<i>She is dressed in</i>
<i>traditional Colonial garb.</i>

1447
01:12:46,988 --> 01:12:48,819
Say goodbye!
We are going down!

1448
01:12:48,906 --> 01:12:49,941
Stay calm.

1449
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:51,317
There is something
they are not telling us.

1450
01:12:51,409 --> 01:12:53,070
There is a Colonial
woman on the wing.

1451
01:12:53,661 --> 01:12:54,696
I will cover the pilot!

1452
01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:01,415
Who is she?
What does she want?

1453
01:13:32,658 --> 01:13:34,774
Just let me make it
up to you, please.

1454
01:13:35,745 --> 01:13:37,656
I'm telling you,

1455
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:40,492
your shower is
going to be amazing.

1456
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:42,577
I have so many ideas.

1457
01:13:42,752 --> 01:13:44,413
I want to talk to
you about the shower.

1458
01:13:44,587 --> 01:13:46,953
I feel like

1459
01:13:47,131 --> 01:13:51,124
it has been really
overwhelming for you.

1460
01:13:51,928 --> 01:13:53,589
It's just starting
to make you crazy.

1461
01:13:53,763 --> 01:13:56,254
No, Lil, I'm fine.
I mean...

1462
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,215
Lil, I'm fine.

1463
01:13:59,352 --> 01:14:00,933
No, you're not fine.

1464
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:03,014
You are not fine, Annie,

1465
01:14:03,189 --> 01:14:06,226
and we need things to just

1466
01:14:07,777 --> 01:14:09,392
flow smoothly from now on

1467
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:13,062
and Helen just knows
how to do this kind of stuff.

1468
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:15,071
She does it all the time.

1469
01:14:15,242 --> 01:14:17,153
She is good at it.
She likes doing it.

1470
01:14:17,745 --> 01:14:20,236
This way you don't have to

1471
01:14:20,998 --> 01:14:24,741
plan any more
lunches or trips.

1472
01:14:24,919 --> 01:14:26,750
You don't have to do anything
you don't want to do.

1473
01:14:26,921 --> 01:14:28,252
I get it.

1474
01:14:28,422 --> 01:14:30,754
I think it'll be
best here on out

1475
01:14:30,925 --> 01:14:33,758
for the shower
and for everything.

1476
01:14:34,261 --> 01:14:36,593
Yeah,
whatever you want.

1477
01:14:36,764 --> 01:14:39,426
I mean,
it's probably best.

1478
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,636
I think so, right?

1479
01:14:41,811 --> 01:14:43,142
Yeah.
I just want you
to be happy.

1480
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:45,428
I think that
will make me happy.
It will be good.

1481
01:14:45,606 --> 01:14:47,642
Okay.
Okay.

1482
01:14:48,609 --> 01:14:49,769
Good.

1483
01:15:13,884 --> 01:15:14,873
Hey.

1484
01:15:15,302 --> 01:15:16,291
Hey.

1485
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:18,961
Do you want to hang out?

1486
01:15:26,814 --> 01:15:28,224
It's not funny!
Stop laughing.

1487
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:29,813
It's a little funny.

1488
01:15:29,984 --> 01:15:32,771
None of those girls
are laughing, believe me.

1489
01:15:32,945 --> 01:15:35,152
It's not funny.
Have you ever been
kicked off a plane?

1490
01:15:35,322 --> 01:15:36,311
I can't say that I have.

1491
01:15:36,449 --> 01:15:37,438
Thank you.

1492
01:15:37,616 --> 01:15:41,325
All of the girls
hate me right now.

1493
01:15:41,495 --> 01:15:43,656
You are like
the maid of dishonor.

1494
01:15:46,167 --> 01:15:48,829
I hope Lillian isn't
going to be mad at me
for too long.

1495
01:15:49,003 --> 01:15:50,709
No, she will be all right.

1496
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,290
I don't know,
I just wish things were

1497
01:15:52,423 --> 01:15:53,833
the way that they
used to be, you know.

1498
01:15:54,008 --> 01:15:55,839
I feel like her
life is going off

1499
01:15:56,010 --> 01:15:59,343
and getting perfect,
and mine is just like...

1500
01:16:01,182 --> 01:16:02,513
It will turn around,
you know.

1501
01:16:02,683 --> 01:16:04,514
I have been hearing
that for a long time.

1502
01:16:04,685 --> 01:16:06,221
It's going to turn around.
I just know it.

1503
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:08,010
Anyway.

1504
01:16:09,023 --> 01:16:10,183
You got to bake.

1505
01:16:10,357 --> 01:16:12,063
I don't really do
that anymore, I told you.

1506
01:16:12,234 --> 01:16:13,394
Why?

1507
01:16:13,527 --> 01:16:14,733
I don't know,
it's just...

1508
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:19,522
I don't know,
after it just went under,
I just, kind of,

1509
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:22,570
stopped, I guess.

1510
01:16:22,745 --> 01:16:24,736
It doesn't make
me happy anymore.

1511
01:16:24,914 --> 01:16:26,620
Just because you didn't
make any money at it,

1512
01:16:26,707 --> 01:16:27,742
doesn't mean that
you failed at it.

1513
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:30,370
I lost a lot of money.

1514
01:16:30,544 --> 01:16:32,500
All my money.

1515
01:16:32,713 --> 01:16:34,203
But you are so good at it.

1516
01:16:34,381 --> 01:16:35,871
Oh, well.
Let's change the subject.

1517
01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:38,211
No more baking.
I'm done.

1518
01:16:38,385 --> 01:16:40,546
I don't know how
you just can't do it anymore.

1519
01:16:40,721 --> 01:16:44,009
If I wasn't a cop anymore,
I would still...

1520
01:16:44,183 --> 01:16:45,172
Arrest people?

1521
01:16:45,351 --> 01:16:47,342
...go out with
a gun and shoot people.

1522
01:16:48,145 --> 01:16:50,636
I probably wouldn't do that.
I'm just trying to
make you feel better.

1523
01:16:52,817 --> 01:16:54,478
You are okay, you know.

1524
01:16:55,694 --> 01:16:56,683
You don't
know me very well.

1525
01:16:56,862 --> 01:16:59,069
I know you well enough
to know that
you're not so bad.

1526
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:00,901
You got some stuff.
Oh, yeah.

1527
01:17:01,075 --> 01:17:02,815
You got bits and
pieces going on.

1528
01:17:02,910 --> 01:17:03,945
Thanks.

1529
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:05,992
I have been thinking
about you a little bit.

1530
01:17:06,163 --> 01:17:07,869
About me? Really?

1531
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:09,496
There is something
about you.

1532
01:17:09,917 --> 01:17:12,203
Something about
you that sticks.

1533
01:17:17,842 --> 01:17:19,673
I hate buttons.

1534
01:17:21,011 --> 01:17:22,421
Where is the bedroom?

1535
01:17:27,184 --> 01:17:29,891
Sorry. It's a mountain bike.
Are you okay?

1536
01:17:30,062 --> 01:17:31,427
Do you like mountain biking?
Uh-huh.

1537
01:17:36,068 --> 01:17:37,228
Take this off.

1538
01:17:37,403 --> 01:17:38,768
I'm so glad
this is happening.

1539
01:17:38,946 --> 01:17:40,186
So am I.

1540
01:17:55,129 --> 01:17:56,790
Hello.
Morning.

1541
01:17:56,964 --> 01:17:58,500
Sorry, I didn't
mean to freak you out.

1542
01:17:58,674 --> 01:17:59,914
No, it's okay.

1543
01:18:00,092 --> 01:18:02,174
I haven't been
sitting here that long.
Oh.

1544
01:18:06,557 --> 01:18:08,013
Sorry, I guess I fell asleep.

1545
01:18:08,225 --> 01:18:11,183
I didn't mean to sleep over.

1546
01:18:12,146 --> 01:18:13,135
Don't be silly.

1547
01:18:14,273 --> 01:18:15,763
I made you a cappuccino.

1548
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:18,273
Made it?
Yeah.

1549
01:18:19,278 --> 01:18:21,143
So, last night was fun.

1550
01:18:22,198 --> 01:18:24,940
It was.
It was very fun.

1551
01:18:26,493 --> 01:18:27,482
I had fun.

1552
01:18:27,661 --> 01:18:29,276
It was fun.

1553
01:18:30,623 --> 01:18:33,330
If you care to
accompany me to the kitchen,

1554
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:35,240
the fun may continue.

1555
01:18:35,419 --> 01:18:37,501
A different kind of fun.

1556
01:18:37,671 --> 01:18:41,255
But why don't you
just get dressed
and whatever, and...

1557
01:18:41,425 --> 01:18:42,756
I left your
clothes over there.

1558
01:18:42,885 --> 01:18:44,216
Okay.

1559
01:18:44,386 --> 01:18:45,671
And I'll see you in there.

1560
01:18:45,846 --> 01:18:47,177
Okay.

1561
01:18:51,685 --> 01:18:53,391
There she is.

1562
01:18:54,271 --> 01:18:56,057
Your workshop awaits.

1563
01:18:56,273 --> 01:18:58,138
I know it's a bit crazy,
but I popped out

1564
01:18:58,234 --> 01:19:01,067
and I got a few little
baking bits and pieces.

1565
01:19:01,237 --> 01:19:02,352
Butter, milk.

1566
01:19:02,529 --> 01:19:05,066
Because I thought
that it would be fun
for us to bake together today.

1567
01:19:05,241 --> 01:19:07,072
Obviously, you will
be doing the baking.

1568
01:19:07,243 --> 01:19:08,858
I will be doing the eating.

1569
01:19:09,036 --> 01:19:11,197
Because you are the expert.

1570
01:19:11,622 --> 01:19:13,203
Yeah, I don't...

1571
01:19:13,374 --> 01:19:15,239
I don't really wanna...

1572
01:19:15,918 --> 01:19:17,954
Sorry. You went to
all this trouble, but...

1573
01:19:18,128 --> 01:19:20,585
Come on, I know you haven't
done it in a while,
but it'll be great.

1574
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:23,873
Don't be silly,
just get into it.
You are so good at it.

1575
01:19:25,177 --> 01:19:27,418
All right. I get it.

1576
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:30,133
It was a bit of a curve ball.

1577
01:19:30,391 --> 01:19:32,256
Yeah, I think
I'm going to go.

1578
01:19:32,434 --> 01:19:35,972
I'm sorry.
I should just
probably go.

1579
01:19:36,522 --> 01:19:37,557
Annie,

1580
01:19:38,691 --> 01:19:40,272
I don't know what
you are getting
so upset about.

1581
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:41,852
Because you don't know me.

1582
01:19:42,486 --> 01:19:45,148
You don't know anything
about me or my life or...

1583
01:19:45,322 --> 01:19:48,155
Well, no, because...
I don't know what
you're trying to do here.

1584
01:19:48,325 --> 01:19:50,407
I don't need you to fix me.
To fix you?

1585
01:19:50,577 --> 01:19:52,943
I don't need any help.
I mean, who do
you think you are?

1586
01:19:53,122 --> 01:19:55,864
Jesus, Annie,
we had a really good time.
And now you are being all...

1587
01:19:56,041 --> 01:19:58,578
It's my fault.
I shouldn't have
come here last night.

1588
01:19:58,752 --> 01:20:00,788
Last night was a mistake.

1589
01:20:00,963 --> 01:20:02,328
Fucking hell. All right.

1590
01:20:18,314 --> 01:20:21,147
<i>Hey, it's Lillian.</i>
<i>Leave a message</i>
<i>after the beep.</i>

1591
01:20:21,984 --> 01:20:24,566
Hey, Lil, it's me.

1592
01:20:24,945 --> 01:20:25,934
Umm...

1593
01:20:26,613 --> 01:20:31,357
I'm sure you're probably still
a little bit mad at me,
but I hope not.

1594
01:20:32,077 --> 01:20:36,241
Anyway, the excitement
still continues with me.

1595
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:41,409
I just slept with
a cop that pulled me over

1596
01:20:41,587 --> 01:20:46,707
and I woke up today,
and he was really
sweet and nice and cute.

1597
01:20:47,009 --> 01:20:50,251
So, naturally,
I ran out
as fast as I could.

1598
01:20:50,429 --> 01:20:52,090
What's wrong with me?

1599
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:53,628
Umm...

1600
01:20:53,724 --> 01:20:56,807
Anyway, I know you
are busy and stuff,

1601
01:20:56,935 --> 01:21:00,018
so just call me
when you get a chance.

1602
01:21:00,189 --> 01:21:04,353
I'd love to talk
this out with you
when you can.

1603
01:21:04,526 --> 01:21:06,437
Okay, bye.

1604
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:17,282
Annie! Annie, wake up.

1605
01:21:17,456 --> 01:21:19,196
It's 11:00 a.m.

1606
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:22,616
Oh, shit.

1607
01:21:22,795 --> 01:21:24,410
You got a package.

1608
01:21:24,588 --> 01:21:28,126
I'd bring it to you,
but you said,
"Don't touch my things."

1609
01:21:57,704 --> 01:21:59,444
<i>Please join us for</i>
<i>a Parisian brunch</i>

1610
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:01,280
<i>at the home of</i>
<i>Helen Harris III</i>

1611
01:22:01,375 --> 01:22:04,538
<i>to celebrate the marriage</i>
<i>of Lillian Donovan</i>
<i>and Douglas Price.</i>

1612
01:22:05,045 --> 01:22:09,960
<i>Let us shower Lillian</i>
<i>with gifts and love.</i>
Répondez s'il vous plaît. <i>Yay!</i>

1613
01:22:18,767 --> 01:22:20,598
Excuse me.
Oh. Hi.

1614
01:22:20,686 --> 01:22:23,143
I'm looking for a birthday
gift for my best friend.
Oh.

1615
01:22:23,230 --> 01:22:25,767
I want to get her
a necklace that says,
"Best Friends Forever."

1616
01:22:26,567 --> 01:22:28,057
You sure you want
it to say "Forever"?

1617
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:30,059
Yeah, why?

1618
01:22:30,195 --> 01:22:31,856
Come on. "Forever"?

1619
01:22:32,739 --> 01:22:33,728
Forever.

1620
01:22:33,824 --> 01:22:36,031
I don't think you guys
will be best friends forever.
No offense.

1621
01:22:36,118 --> 01:22:37,528
But you know...

1622
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:39,655
The friends you have
when you are
younger sometimes...

1623
01:22:39,913 --> 01:22:41,949
Sometimes you grow apart
when you get older.

1624
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:43,576
Maybe she'll find
a new best friend.

1625
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:45,456
And maybe she
will be more
successful than you are

1626
01:22:45,544 --> 01:22:47,751
and prettier and
richer and skinnier

1627
01:22:47,921 --> 01:22:50,162
and they end up doing
everything together.

1628
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:52,585
You are weird.

1629
01:22:52,843 --> 01:22:54,424
I'm not weird. Okay?

1630
01:22:55,095 --> 01:22:56,084
Yes, you are.

1631
01:22:56,180 --> 01:22:57,169
No, I'm not,
and you started it.

1632
01:22:57,347 --> 01:22:58,883
No, you started it.

1633
01:22:59,057 --> 01:23:00,922
Did you forget
to take your Xanax
this morning?

1634
01:23:01,101 --> 01:23:02,591
God, I feel bad
for your parents.

1635
01:23:02,686 --> 01:23:03,721
I feel bad for your face.

1636
01:23:04,021 --> 01:23:06,103
Okay, well,
call me when
your boobs come in.

1637
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:07,851
You call me
when yours come in.

1638
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:09,939
What, do you have
four boyfriends?
Exactly.

1639
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:12,977
Yeah, okay, have fun
having a baby at your prom.

1640
01:23:13,155 --> 01:23:14,691
You look like an old mop.

1641
01:23:14,865 --> 01:23:16,696
You know what?
You're not as popular
as you think you are.

1642
01:23:16,783 --> 01:23:17,772
I am very popular.

1643
01:23:18,076 --> 01:23:20,032
I'm sure you are.

1644
01:23:20,496 --> 01:23:21,611
Very popular.

1645
01:23:21,788 --> 01:23:23,449
Well, you're an old,
single loser

1646
01:23:23,582 --> 01:23:25,197
who is never going
to have any friends.

1647
01:23:26,001 --> 01:23:27,286
You're a little cunt.

1648
01:23:35,344 --> 01:23:36,584
I'm sorry.

1649
01:23:40,349 --> 01:23:42,465
Let me tell my mom, okay.

1650
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:44,721
I already told her.

1651
01:23:45,312 --> 01:23:46,472
Was she mad?

1652
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:57,566
<i>Hi, Annie,</i>
<i>it's Rhodes again.</i>

1653
01:23:57,741 --> 01:23:59,151
<i>Since you're not</i>
<i>returning any of my calls,</i>

1654
01:23:59,326 --> 01:24:00,736
<i>I assume that</i>
<i>you're not interested</i>

1655
01:24:00,911 --> 01:24:03,152
<i>in spending any</i>
<i>more time with me,</i>
<i>which is fine.</i>

1656
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:06,743
<i>So don't worry,</i>
<i>I won't be bothering</i>
<i>you ever again.</i>

1657
01:24:07,584 --> 01:24:09,290
<i>Get those taillights fixed.</i>

1658
01:24:17,094 --> 01:24:21,337
We'd like to invite you
to no longer live
with us anymore.

1659
01:24:22,766 --> 01:24:24,506
What? What do you mean?
I don't get it.

1660
01:24:24,851 --> 01:24:27,763
The thing is,
we decided that it was
actually a bit immature

1661
01:24:27,854 --> 01:24:29,185
for a grown-up
brother and sister to

1662
01:24:29,356 --> 01:24:30,687
still be living
together with a roommate.

1663
01:24:30,983 --> 01:24:33,770
At our age, it's a bit
ridiculous, isn't it?
Yeah.

1664
01:24:33,860 --> 01:24:35,976
We look a bit silly,
don't we?
Pathetic.

1665
01:24:36,154 --> 01:24:38,236
So we are actually
going to live together alone.

1666
01:24:38,615 --> 01:24:39,855
Without you.

1667
01:24:40,075 --> 01:24:41,531
You're moving out.

1668
01:24:45,247 --> 01:24:46,407
She's not moving.

1669
01:24:46,498 --> 01:24:47,738
She will move.

1670
01:24:47,916 --> 01:24:49,156
Eventually.
Eventually.

1671
01:24:49,251 --> 01:24:50,366
She has to.

1672
01:24:50,586 --> 01:24:51,666
She is taking it in.

1673
01:24:51,753 --> 01:24:53,334
You have to leave.

1674
01:24:53,505 --> 01:24:54,870
Oh! That's prickly.

1675
01:25:00,137 --> 01:25:01,718
Hi.
Hi.

1676
01:25:03,724 --> 01:25:06,181
Remember when you
thought I hit bottom?

1677
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:08,391
That wasn't bottom.

1678
01:25:08,729 --> 01:25:10,390
Come here.

1679
01:25:11,231 --> 01:25:14,064
We're gonna have fun.
I, for one,
am really glad you're here.

1680
01:25:14,568 --> 01:25:15,853
And guess what?

1681
01:25:16,403 --> 01:25:17,984
Good timing.

1682
01:25:18,488 --> 01:25:20,729
You know what
just came in today
on the Netflix?

1683
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:23,315
<i>Cast Away.</i> Tom Hanks.

1684
01:25:23,493 --> 01:25:25,484
It's like <i>Forrest Gump,</i>
but on an island.

1685
01:25:25,662 --> 01:25:27,744
Honey, you are gonna love it.

1686
01:25:56,276 --> 01:25:58,733
My God.

1687
01:25:59,196 --> 01:26:00,652
This is her driveway?

1688
01:26:02,199 --> 01:26:04,235
Who is that man?

1689
01:26:08,413 --> 01:26:10,620
Are you a guest of
Helen Harris III?

1690
01:26:11,458 --> 01:26:13,619
Yes. Technically. I guess.

1691
01:26:13,794 --> 01:26:15,785
An attendant will
meet you at the stables.

1692
01:26:16,046 --> 01:26:17,206
Where?

1693
01:26:17,339 --> 01:26:18,545
The shower is over
the second bridge.

1694
01:26:18,715 --> 01:26:21,582
Pink lemonade?
Thank you.

1695
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:24,797
I don't have a cup holder.
Can I just give that...

1696
01:26:28,642 --> 01:26:31,805
Pink lemonade.
Nice. Nice touch.

1697
01:26:33,313 --> 01:26:34,769
Shit.

1698
01:26:42,572 --> 01:26:44,779
God damn it, that's good.

1699
01:26:44,866 --> 01:26:45,855
Mmm.

1700
01:26:47,786 --> 01:26:49,617
Shit, that is fresh.

1701
01:27:06,179 --> 01:27:08,636
This is the most
beautiful shower
I have ever been to.

1702
01:27:09,015 --> 01:27:11,506
Yes, and Helen
is giving out the
cutest party favors.

1703
01:27:11,601 --> 01:27:14,468
I know,
I love their pink berets.

1704
01:27:30,036 --> 01:27:31,867
Would you like
some champagne?
Yes.

1705
01:27:32,289 --> 01:27:33,324
It's French.

1706
01:27:34,541 --> 01:27:36,406
Annie. Hey.

1707
01:27:36,835 --> 01:27:37,824
Hi.

1708
01:27:39,004 --> 01:27:40,835
How are you doing?
You're here.

1709
01:27:41,381 --> 01:27:43,838
Yeah, I'm here.
I was invited. Sorry.

1710
01:27:44,217 --> 01:27:46,629
Of course you were invited.
I just meant you have arrived.

1711
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:49,382
No, I was just joking.
Okay.

1712
01:27:50,307 --> 01:27:51,922
Can you believe this?
Isn't it amazing?

1713
01:27:52,726 --> 01:27:53,841
Yep.

1714
01:27:54,019 --> 01:27:55,555
Yeah. It's nice.

1715
01:27:55,729 --> 01:27:57,720
Yeah. Pretty.

1716
01:27:58,356 --> 01:27:59,766
Are we okay?

1717
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:01,390
Yes, I'm sorry
I haven't called.

1718
01:28:01,568 --> 01:28:03,980
I just didn't want
to bug you, but...

1719
01:28:04,070 --> 01:28:06,402
Forgive me.
It just got crazy.

1720
01:28:06,490 --> 01:28:09,323
There has been lots
of organizing, and...
I have so much to tell you.

1721
01:28:09,409 --> 01:28:11,900
I have to say hi to my aunt
or she will get mad at my mom.

1722
01:28:11,995 --> 01:28:13,405
No, you gotta go do
your party rounds.

1723
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:15,036
Yeah.

1724
01:28:15,207 --> 01:28:16,367
I'll see you in a minute.

1725
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:17,660
Yeah. Okay.

1726
01:28:17,834 --> 01:28:19,495
Oh! Rita,
you got all our towels.

1727
01:28:19,586 --> 01:28:21,918
Yes, I did.
Because I love you, kitten.

1728
01:28:22,172 --> 01:28:24,163
All right,
let's see what's next.

1729
01:28:24,299 --> 01:28:26,335
Another one,
another one, another one.

1730
01:28:26,510 --> 01:28:29,843
I know who this is from.
I can tell by the wrapping.

1731
01:28:30,013 --> 01:28:31,378
Is that you?

1732
01:28:33,892 --> 01:28:36,224
Annie, you made this.

1733
01:28:37,229 --> 01:28:38,264
Look.

1734
01:28:38,522 --> 01:28:40,228
Oh, man.
- Oh, my gosh.

1735
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:41,976
It's us, Annie.

1736
01:28:42,567 --> 01:28:44,558
Oh, my God.
Let me see.

1737
01:28:46,029 --> 01:28:47,485
Oh, my God.

1738
01:28:48,448 --> 01:28:53,488
This is all my
favorite stuff from all the
stores I love in Milwaukee.

1739
01:28:53,578 --> 01:28:56,615
Annie!
This is so unbelievable.

1740
01:28:57,082 --> 01:28:58,117
Wilson Phillips.

1741
01:28:59,501 --> 01:29:00,786
Man, I love Wilson Phillips.

1742
01:29:00,961 --> 01:29:02,997
We listened to <i>Hold On</i>
probably 10,000 times

1743
01:29:03,088 --> 01:29:04,828
when I got my
driver's license.

1744
01:29:05,048 --> 01:29:07,960
This is such an amazing gift.

1745
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:09,625
Thank you.
You're welcome.

1746
01:29:10,762 --> 01:29:12,377
I feel really bad, Lil,

1747
01:29:12,472 --> 01:29:14,554
I didn't get a chance
to actually get you a present

1748
01:29:14,641 --> 01:29:16,677
because I have been so busy
organizing the shower.

1749
01:29:16,768 --> 01:29:19,305
Helen, please.
It's more than enough.

1750
01:29:19,479 --> 01:29:21,720
Here is a card to
say congratulations.

1751
01:29:21,815 --> 01:29:25,649
Thank you.
Gosh, you have
really outdone yourself.

1752
01:29:27,988 --> 01:29:29,353
Oh, my God, Helen.

1753
01:29:31,324 --> 01:29:32,939
Honey, what is it?

1754
01:29:33,660 --> 01:29:36,026
Helen's taking me
to Paris.

1755
01:29:38,832 --> 01:29:40,117
Your face!

1756
01:29:40,333 --> 01:29:41,789
I got you. I fooled you.

1757
01:29:41,877 --> 01:29:42,866
Look at your face.

1758
01:29:44,004 --> 01:29:47,167
It's just a little
pre-wedding vacation.
And while we're there,

1759
01:29:47,257 --> 01:29:49,498
we're gonna meet
the designer of her dress
and have a fitting.

1760
01:29:49,676 --> 01:29:52,167
You are
taking me to Paris?

1761
01:29:52,345 --> 01:29:54,882
Oh, my God! This is
the best present ever!

1762
01:29:55,515 --> 01:29:57,005
Thank you so much.

1763
01:29:57,142 --> 01:29:58,131
<i>À Paris!</i>

1764
01:29:58,268 --> 01:29:59,303
Oh, my God.

1765
01:29:59,519 --> 01:30:01,100
Are you fucking kidding me?

1766
01:30:02,856 --> 01:30:04,141
Annie!
No, Mom.

1767
01:30:04,232 --> 01:30:05,517
Motherfucking Paris?

1768
01:30:05,692 --> 01:30:06,727
Annie,
what are you doing?

1769
01:30:06,860 --> 01:30:10,148
I told you about Paris, Helen.
I told you about
this whole idea!

1770
01:30:10,238 --> 01:30:11,569
Annie, calm down.
- No, Lillian!

1771
01:30:11,698 --> 01:30:14,235
What, you're gonna
go to Paris with Helen now?

1772
01:30:14,367 --> 01:30:16,449
What, you guys are
gonna ride around
on bikes

1773
01:30:16,536 --> 01:30:18,197
with berets and
fucking baguettes

1774
01:30:18,330 --> 01:30:19,945
in the basket of
the front of your bikes?

1775
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:21,200
How romantic!

1776
01:30:21,499 --> 01:30:24,832
What woman
gives another woman
a trip to Paris?

1777
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:26,876
Am I right? Lesbian.

1778
01:30:27,047 --> 01:30:28,628
We're all thinking it,
aren't we?
I'm not.

1779
01:30:28,715 --> 01:30:31,047
Okay? Yes, we're all
thinking it, right?
I was.

1780
01:30:31,217 --> 01:30:34,050
Annie...
Lillian, this is not
the "you" that I know.

1781
01:30:34,220 --> 01:30:35,551
The "you" that I
know would have

1782
01:30:35,722 --> 01:30:37,053
walked in here
and rolled your eyes

1783
01:30:37,182 --> 01:30:38,672
and thought
this was completely

1784
01:30:38,808 --> 01:30:40,298
over-the-top,
ridiculous and stupid.

1785
01:30:40,393 --> 01:30:43,885
Look at this shower!
Look at that fucking cookie!

1786
01:30:44,105 --> 01:30:46,141
Did you really think
that this group of women

1787
01:30:46,274 --> 01:30:48,356
was going to
finish that cookie?

1788
01:30:48,485 --> 01:30:50,066
Really? You know what?
That reminds me, actually.

1789
01:30:50,236 --> 01:30:53,728
I never got a chance
to try that fucking cookie!

1790
01:30:55,408 --> 01:30:57,239
Stupid fucking cookie!

1791
01:31:00,914 --> 01:31:03,747
Delicious! Stupid cookie.
I think I'll...

1792
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:07,952
Maybe it's better if I
dip it in the chocolate.

1793
01:31:15,053 --> 01:31:16,259
Is this what
you want, Lillian?

1794
01:31:23,186 --> 01:31:24,471
This is so awesome.

1795
01:31:24,562 --> 01:31:30,933
All right,
let's have some nice,
hot, unsanitary chocolate!

1796
01:31:37,826 --> 01:31:39,987
Ahh! It's hot!
Jesus! God!

1797
01:31:40,078 --> 01:31:42,740
Christ, Annie.
Have you lost
your fucking mind?

1798
01:31:42,831 --> 01:31:44,696
What are you doing?
What am I doing?

1799
01:31:44,791 --> 01:31:46,873
You wouldn't know,
would you?
Where have you been?

1800
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:49,121
You would have no idea.
Let me fill you in, okay?

1801
01:31:49,337 --> 01:31:51,874
Ever since you got engaged,
everything has turned to shit!

1802
01:31:51,965 --> 01:31:54,672
You know what?
This is supposed
to be about my time!

1803
01:31:54,801 --> 01:31:56,917
You have managed
to ruin every event

1804
01:31:57,053 --> 01:31:59,169
in my wedding.
Thank you very much.

1805
01:31:59,305 --> 01:32:00,636
Okay, well,
thank you very much.

1806
01:32:00,765 --> 01:32:02,130
It's all her fault.
It is not mine!

1807
01:32:02,225 --> 01:32:03,431
And you would know that,

1808
01:32:03,518 --> 01:32:06,510
if you got your
beautiful haired head
out of your asshole.

1809
01:32:06,604 --> 01:32:10,813
In fact, out of her asshole,
which I'm sure is
perfectly bleached.

1810
01:32:10,942 --> 01:32:12,557
You know what? It is!

1811
01:32:12,652 --> 01:32:13,937
And you know how I know?

1812
01:32:14,029 --> 01:32:15,940
Because I went to
the fucking salon with her

1813
01:32:16,072 --> 01:32:17,983
and I got my
asshole bleached, too!

1814
01:32:18,324 --> 01:32:21,157
And I love my new asshole!

1815
01:32:22,078 --> 01:32:24,694
You know what?
Why can't you
just be happy for me

1816
01:32:24,789 --> 01:32:28,407
and then go home and
talk behind my back later,
like a normal person?

1817
01:32:30,003 --> 01:32:32,540
I am happy for you, Lillian.
I am very happy for you.

1818
01:32:32,630 --> 01:32:36,214
I wish you well.
I won't bother
you anymore.

1819
01:32:37,177 --> 01:32:39,919
Are you kidding me? Annie!

1820
01:32:40,013 --> 01:32:41,674
Go, go, go, go, go!

1821
01:32:42,182 --> 01:32:44,468
Get back here! Stop.

1822
01:32:46,144 --> 01:32:48,681
No, no! She does
not get a party favor.

1823
01:32:48,897 --> 01:32:50,762
She does not get a dog!

1824
01:32:53,359 --> 01:32:54,940
And if you are
going to act like this,

1825
01:32:55,028 --> 01:32:57,440
then don't even bother
coming to my wedding!

1826
01:33:06,164 --> 01:33:07,244
I'm proud of you, Lil.

1827
01:33:07,373 --> 01:33:08,488
Shut up, Helen!

1828
01:33:09,876 --> 01:33:12,743
Anybody else have anything
they want to share today?

1829
01:33:15,048 --> 01:33:18,290
I took two dogs already.
They're in the back of my van.

1830
01:33:36,736 --> 01:33:38,067
What?

1831
01:33:47,580 --> 01:33:50,162
What? Where are you going?

1832
01:33:50,875 --> 01:33:52,411
Hit and run! Classy!

1833
01:33:52,669 --> 01:33:54,079
Perfect! Okay.

1834
01:33:55,213 --> 01:33:58,751
I'm gonna find you!
I'm coming!

1835
01:33:58,925 --> 01:34:03,294
Come on! Come on! Come on.

1836
01:34:06,766 --> 01:34:08,757
No!

1837
01:34:24,075 --> 01:34:26,361
Shit.

1838
01:34:29,956 --> 01:34:32,163
I can't say
I'm surprised.

1839
01:34:32,333 --> 01:34:34,494
I did tell you to
get your lights fixed.

1840
01:34:34,669 --> 01:34:36,159
Yeah, I know.

1841
01:34:36,296 --> 01:34:38,412
And now here we are.

1842
01:34:39,966 --> 01:34:43,379
Look, I have
had a horrible day.

1843
01:34:43,553 --> 01:34:45,919
I don't need a lecture
from you right now, okay?

1844
01:34:46,097 --> 01:34:47,633
I just... Helen just...

1845
01:34:48,099 --> 01:34:49,088
Oh! Don't...

1846
01:34:49,475 --> 01:34:51,261
This didn't happen
because of Helen.

1847
01:34:51,603 --> 01:34:54,310
This happened
because you didn't get
your taillights fixed.

1848
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:55,970
It's pretty simple.

1849
01:34:59,485 --> 01:35:01,771
Do you have any idea
how frustrating it is

1850
01:35:01,905 --> 01:35:04,237
to see you,
night by night,
drive past me

1851
01:35:04,407 --> 01:35:07,114
with your fucking
taillights still broken?

1852
01:35:07,285 --> 01:35:09,401
Do you have any idea
how crazy that makes me?

1853
01:35:09,579 --> 01:35:11,991
It's a simple solution!

1854
01:35:12,081 --> 01:35:13,161
Your problem, Annie,

1855
01:35:13,249 --> 01:35:16,161
is that you just
don't understand
that you can hurt people

1856
01:35:16,461 --> 01:35:18,497
with these broken lights.

1857
01:35:19,756 --> 01:35:21,838
Don't you see how
irresponsible this is?

1858
01:35:21,925 --> 01:35:25,668
Yes, I should have
gotten my fucking
taillights fixed.

1859
01:35:25,845 --> 01:35:27,756
But I didn't, okay?
I didn't.

1860
01:35:27,931 --> 01:35:30,092
Listen,
don't worry about it.

1861
01:35:30,266 --> 01:35:32,803
Seriously.
Your message
was received.

1862
01:35:32,977 --> 01:35:35,764
No, look, please,
I don't know what's
going on with me right now.

1863
01:35:35,855 --> 01:35:39,689
Look, it's fine. Don't bother.
Really, what's done is done.

1864
01:35:39,859 --> 01:35:41,349
That's it?
Where are you going?

1865
01:35:41,486 --> 01:35:44,102
That's it! That's it.
That's how this works.

1866
01:35:44,239 --> 01:35:45,274
Come on. I didn't...

1867
01:35:45,365 --> 01:35:49,108
For the record, Annie,
you flirted with me.

1868
01:35:49,494 --> 01:35:53,453
You made me feel like
you really liked me,

1869
01:35:53,539 --> 01:35:54,870
which was really unfair.

1870
01:35:55,208 --> 01:35:58,700
And then you came home with me
and we did stuff, fun stuff,

1871
01:35:59,879 --> 01:36:02,165
and then you just left,
just like it was nothing.

1872
01:36:02,715 --> 01:36:06,253
Oh, please. I know
how guys do this thing.

1873
01:36:06,344 --> 01:36:07,834
I know how guys act.

1874
01:36:08,012 --> 01:36:10,549
One minute,
it means something.
The next minute, it doesn't.

1875
01:36:10,682 --> 01:36:11,717
Right, yeah, you've
got it all figured out.

1876
01:36:11,849 --> 01:36:12,884
Yeah.

1877
01:36:12,976 --> 01:36:15,683
How is that
working out for you?
Pretty good?

1878
01:36:18,982 --> 01:36:20,142
Boom!

1879
01:36:20,233 --> 01:36:22,565
What's up, fuck-buddy?
You call for some
roadside assistance?

1880
01:36:27,407 --> 01:36:30,991
Thanks, officer.
I can handle it
from here on out.

1881
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:37,075
Come on!

1882
01:36:38,418 --> 01:36:40,033
I didn't have
anyone else to call!

1883
01:36:40,128 --> 01:36:41,493
I didn't know that
you were gonna show up!

1884
01:36:41,587 --> 01:36:42,997
That's the problem
with cops, Annie.

1885
01:36:43,131 --> 01:36:44,587
We're just never
there when you need us.

1886
01:36:46,718 --> 01:36:47,753
That cop talks weird.

1887
01:36:54,684 --> 01:36:58,051
Come on, dingus.
Tick-tock. I got shit to do.

1888
01:36:59,105 --> 01:37:01,437
Check it out.
Look what's steering the car.

1889
01:37:07,697 --> 01:37:09,312
Thanks again
for picking me up.

1890
01:37:09,407 --> 01:37:10,897
Not a problem.

1891
01:37:11,451 --> 01:37:12,816
Were you busy?

1892
01:37:13,077 --> 01:37:15,238
Well, it is Friday.

1893
01:37:17,457 --> 01:37:20,164
You know,
you look tired.

1894
01:37:20,293 --> 01:37:22,375
If you're tired,
you can totally

1895
01:37:22,503 --> 01:37:24,619
lay down in my lap,
if you want.

1896
01:37:25,173 --> 01:37:26,208
What?

1897
01:37:26,299 --> 01:37:28,540
Just take a little lap-nap.

1898
01:37:34,807 --> 01:37:36,217
If you want.

1899
01:37:37,018 --> 01:37:38,428
Open for biz.

1900
01:37:38,603 --> 01:37:40,139
Okay, can you just pull over?

1901
01:37:40,313 --> 01:37:42,224
Yeah, actually,
that's an even better idea.

1902
01:37:42,315 --> 01:37:45,728
No, no, no, can you
please just stop the car?
I want to get out.

1903
01:37:45,818 --> 01:37:46,978
No, it's super gravelly.

1904
01:37:47,070 --> 01:37:49,026
Please pull over!
Why?

1905
01:37:49,113 --> 01:37:51,479
Because I would rather
get murdered out here

1906
01:37:51,574 --> 01:37:53,735
than spend the next
half-an-hour with you.

1907
01:37:53,826 --> 01:37:55,441
Can you please
just pull over?

1908
01:37:55,828 --> 01:37:57,910
Come on, Annie.
It's called humor.

1909
01:37:58,081 --> 01:37:59,912
Learn about it.

1910
01:38:00,792 --> 01:38:02,703
Besides, I would
never last a half-hour.

1911
01:38:07,256 --> 01:38:08,371
Goodbye, Ted.

1912
01:38:12,929 --> 01:38:15,716
If you're trying to
turn me on, it's working.

1913
01:38:17,850 --> 01:38:19,465
You used me!

1914
01:38:19,644 --> 01:38:22,932
No big deal.
You are no longer
my number three!

1915
01:38:35,910 --> 01:38:37,070
<i>Wilson!</i>

1916
01:38:40,498 --> 01:38:44,082
<i>Wilson! I'm sorry!</i>

1917
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:47,831
<i>I'm sorry, Wilson.</i>

1918
01:38:48,798 --> 01:38:51,005
<i>Wilson, I'm sorry!</i>

1919
01:38:51,759 --> 01:38:52,748
<i>I'm sorry!</i>

1920
01:38:52,844 --> 01:38:54,129
Oh, no, Wilson.

1921
01:38:54,303 --> 01:38:55,463
<i>Wilson!</i>

1922
01:38:57,682 --> 01:38:59,343
I'm coming in.

1923
01:38:59,517 --> 01:39:01,508
Let's go, let's go.
And we're walking.

1924
01:39:01,936 --> 01:39:03,801
Okay, we're walking.
Heel. Heel!

1925
01:39:04,230 --> 01:39:06,562
No pee. No!
Not on the carpet!

1926
01:39:06,732 --> 01:39:08,848
Okay, we're coming...
We're coming in.

1927
01:39:08,943 --> 01:39:11,309
Everybody is in
and having fun.

1928
01:39:11,487 --> 01:39:13,728
We're having fun.
And heel! We're heeling.

1929
01:39:14,449 --> 01:39:15,438
Heel!

1930
01:39:15,908 --> 01:39:17,318
How many of
those did you take?

1931
01:39:17,452 --> 01:39:20,114
I took nine.

1932
01:39:20,288 --> 01:39:25,032
Yeah, I did
slightly over-commit
to the whole dog thing.

1933
01:39:25,126 --> 01:39:28,038
It turns out, I'm probably
more comfortable with six.

1934
01:39:28,212 --> 01:39:31,295
It's a lot... That's
a lot of energy to deal with.

1935
01:39:31,466 --> 01:39:33,047
But you wouldn't know
anything about that,

1936
01:39:33,176 --> 01:39:34,757
because you haven't
been returning my calls.

1937
01:39:36,429 --> 01:39:38,465
And say what, Megan?

1938
01:39:38,556 --> 01:39:41,514
Say, "Hi, I can't
get off the couch.

1939
01:39:41,726 --> 01:39:45,184
"I got fired from my job.
I got kicked out
of my apartment.

1940
01:39:45,271 --> 01:39:48,513
"I can't pay any of my bills.
My car is a piece of shit.

1941
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:51,145
"I don't have any friends.
The last time I..."

1942
01:39:51,235 --> 01:39:53,567
You know what I
find interesting
about that, Annie?

1943
01:39:53,654 --> 01:39:56,612
It's interesting to me
that you have
absolutely no friends.

1944
01:39:56,699 --> 01:39:58,155
You know why
it's interesting?

1945
01:39:58,326 --> 01:39:59,657
Here's a friend
standing directly

1946
01:39:59,785 --> 01:40:01,150
in front of you,
trying to talk to you.

1947
01:40:01,287 --> 01:40:02,697
And you choose to
talk about the fact

1948
01:40:02,830 --> 01:40:04,240
that you don't
have any friends.

1949
01:40:04,332 --> 01:40:05,697
You know what I mean.

1950
01:40:05,833 --> 01:40:07,198
No, I don't think
you want any help.

1951
01:40:07,293 --> 01:40:09,329
I think you want to
have a little pity party.
That's not true.

1952
01:40:09,420 --> 01:40:11,502
I think Annie wants
a little pity party.

1953
01:40:11,631 --> 01:40:13,667
You're an asshole, Annie!
Oh, my God.
What are you doing?

1954
01:40:13,758 --> 01:40:16,340
You're an asshole. I'm life.
Is life bothering you?

1955
01:40:16,427 --> 01:40:17,462
Yes! What are you doing?

1956
01:40:17,637 --> 01:40:18,672
I'm life, Annie.
I'm life, Annie.

1957
01:40:18,888 --> 01:40:21,300
You have got to
fight back on life.

1958
01:40:21,390 --> 01:40:22,630
Megan!

1959
01:40:22,767 --> 01:40:24,007
You better learn to fight.

1960
01:40:24,268 --> 01:40:25,257
Megan!

1961
01:40:25,353 --> 01:40:27,139
I'm life and I'm going
to bite you in the ass!

1962
01:40:29,315 --> 01:40:31,226
Megan...
It's not me.
I'm your life. Turn over!

1963
01:40:31,317 --> 01:40:32,477
My God!

1964
01:40:32,568 --> 01:40:36,436
I'm trying to get you to fight
for your shitty life,
and you won't do it!

1965
01:40:36,531 --> 01:40:37,566
You just won't do it.
Stop it.

1966
01:40:37,823 --> 01:40:39,984
You stop slapping yourself.
Stop slapping yourself.

1967
01:40:40,159 --> 01:40:42,650
I'm your life, Annie.
I'm your shitty...

1968
01:40:44,038 --> 01:40:45,027
I'm sorry.

1969
01:40:46,165 --> 01:40:47,154
Nice hit.

1970
01:40:49,961 --> 01:40:50,950
All right.

1971
01:40:51,045 --> 01:40:53,286
I'm glad to see
you've got a little
bit of spark in you.

1972
01:40:54,131 --> 01:40:55,996
I knew that Annie
was in there somewhere.

1973
01:40:56,384 --> 01:40:57,840
I think...

1974
01:40:58,010 --> 01:41:01,343
I think you're ready now
to hear a little
story about a girl.

1975
01:41:01,514 --> 01:41:03,550
A girl named Megan.

1976
01:41:03,724 --> 01:41:05,214
A girl named
Megan that didn't have

1977
01:41:05,351 --> 01:41:06,887
a very good time
in high school.

1978
01:41:07,061 --> 01:41:10,144
I'm referring to
myself when I say "Megan."

1979
01:41:10,314 --> 01:41:12,225
It's me, Megan.
Yeah, I got that.

1980
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:13,890
I know you look at
me now and think,

1981
01:41:13,985 --> 01:41:15,941
"Boy, she must have
breezed through high school."

1982
01:41:16,028 --> 01:41:17,564
Not the case, Annie.

1983
01:41:17,655 --> 01:41:21,489
No, this was not easy
going up and down the halls.
Okay?

1984
01:41:21,576 --> 01:41:23,157
They used to
try to blow me up.

1985
01:41:23,286 --> 01:41:24,867
They threw
firecrackers at my head.

1986
01:41:25,496 --> 01:41:26,485
Firecrackers.

1987
01:41:26,872 --> 01:41:29,284
I mean literally.
I'm not saying
that figuratively.

1988
01:41:29,375 --> 01:41:32,082
I got firecrackers
thrown at my head.
They called me a freak.

1989
01:41:32,628 --> 01:41:33,868
Do you think I
let that break me?

1990
01:41:34,297 --> 01:41:36,583
Do you think I went home
to my mommy, crying,

1991
01:41:36,674 --> 01:41:39,416
"I don't have any friends.
Megan doesn't
have any friends"

1992
01:41:39,510 --> 01:41:41,876
No, I did not.
You know what I did?

1993
01:41:41,971 --> 01:41:44,462
I pulled myself up,
I studied really hard.

1994
01:41:44,557 --> 01:41:46,718
I read every book in
the library. And now?

1995
01:41:46,809 --> 01:41:48,219
I work for the government.
I have

1996
01:41:48,352 --> 01:41:49,762
the highest possible
security clearance.

1997
01:41:49,854 --> 01:41:51,390
Don't repeat that!
I won't.

1998
01:41:51,480 --> 01:41:52,515
I can't protect you.

1999
01:41:52,815 --> 01:41:55,056
I know where
all the nukes are
and I know the codes.

2000
01:41:57,069 --> 01:41:58,104
I won't say anything.

2001
01:41:58,362 --> 01:42:00,478
You would be amazed.

2002
01:42:00,740 --> 01:42:02,071
A lot of shopping malls.

2003
01:42:02,283 --> 01:42:03,489
Don't repeat that!

2004
01:42:03,618 --> 01:42:04,858
I won't.

2005
01:42:05,036 --> 01:42:06,116
I have six houses.

2006
01:42:06,495 --> 01:42:09,532
I bought an 18-wheeler
a couple of months
ago just because I could.

2007
01:42:09,624 --> 01:42:10,830
Okay, you lost Lillian.

2008
01:42:10,916 --> 01:42:12,247
You got another best friend

2009
01:42:12,335 --> 01:42:13,996
sitting right in front of you,
if you would notice.

2010
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:15,955
Huh?

2011
01:42:16,047 --> 01:42:17,753
Now, you got to stop
feeling sorry for yourself.

2012
01:42:18,424 --> 01:42:20,039
Okay, 'cause I do not
associate with people

2013
01:42:20,176 --> 01:42:21,791
that blame the world
for their problems.

2014
01:42:21,886 --> 01:42:23,626
'Cause you're
your problem, Annie.

2015
01:42:23,804 --> 01:42:26,170
And you're also
your solution.

2016
01:42:27,725 --> 01:42:29,261
Right? I mean, that's...

2017
01:42:29,352 --> 01:42:31,468
You get that?

2018
01:42:32,647 --> 01:42:34,103
I just miss her, I guess.

2019
01:42:35,024 --> 01:42:37,140
Yeah, I know you do.

2020
01:42:37,610 --> 01:42:39,566
I know you do.

2021
01:42:39,987 --> 01:42:41,943
All right, come on.
Bring it in.

2022
01:42:42,031 --> 01:42:43,441
There's the Annie...

2023
01:42:43,532 --> 01:42:45,238
There's the Annie I
knew was there, okay?

2024
01:42:45,368 --> 01:42:47,609
All right.
Man, you have got
to wash your hair.

2025
01:42:47,745 --> 01:42:48,734
I'm sorry.

2026
01:42:48,829 --> 01:42:50,239
You've got to
wash that hair.

2027
01:43:15,898 --> 01:43:17,183
What's wrong?

2028
01:43:17,358 --> 01:43:18,689
Nothing.

2029
01:43:23,656 --> 01:43:24,691
I love you.

2030
01:43:38,212 --> 01:43:40,669
Looks great. Thank you.

2031
01:43:40,923 --> 01:43:44,711
Rhodes and I worked out
a deal way back when,
so it's on the house.

2032
01:43:45,428 --> 01:43:46,508
Are you serious?

2033
01:43:46,721 --> 01:43:49,007
Yeah. I owe him big time.

2034
01:43:49,265 --> 01:43:51,005
That's really nice.

2035
01:43:58,441 --> 01:43:59,681
Hey, Mom?

2036
01:44:01,861 --> 01:44:03,146
This is my mom, Judy.

2037
01:44:03,237 --> 01:44:05,228
Hey, how are you?
Nice to meet you.

2038
01:44:05,322 --> 01:44:07,233
Good to meet you, too.

2039
01:44:08,242 --> 01:44:10,233
Wait a minute,
don't I know you from AA?

2040
01:44:10,578 --> 01:44:13,911
Oh, my gosh.
You made that artichoke dip,
didn't you?

2041
01:44:14,081 --> 01:44:15,571
It's good, huh?

2042
01:44:15,666 --> 01:44:16,701
It's just delicious.

2043
01:45:21,607 --> 01:45:22,596
Come in.

2044
01:45:27,196 --> 01:45:29,278
Are you sure
you're not gonna
come with me today?

2045
01:45:29,532 --> 01:45:31,022
It's Lillian's big day.

2046
01:45:31,116 --> 01:45:32,902
Mom, she doesn't
want me there.

2047
01:45:36,580 --> 01:45:38,536
I'll fix you
a tuna fish sandwich.

2048
01:45:38,833 --> 01:45:40,118
Mom, it's 8:00
in the morning.

2049
01:45:40,251 --> 01:45:41,661
You can put syrup on it.

2050
01:45:51,637 --> 01:45:53,047
I know.

2051
01:45:54,223 --> 01:45:55,212
Hi.

2052
01:45:55,558 --> 01:45:56,638
What do you want?

2053
01:45:56,809 --> 01:45:58,845
I was wondering
if you knew
where Lillian was.

2054
01:45:59,228 --> 01:46:01,139
No, why would I...
What do you mean?

2055
01:46:01,522 --> 01:46:04,138
I can't find her.
We've looked everywhere.

2056
01:46:04,316 --> 01:46:05,396
What?

2057
01:46:05,484 --> 01:46:07,645
She is missing.
Can you help?

2058
01:46:08,153 --> 01:46:09,814
Okay, just wait here.
I think I know

2059
01:46:09,989 --> 01:46:11,650
someone that
might be able to help.

2060
01:46:11,824 --> 01:46:13,985
I'll get my keys.
Can I just use...

2061
01:46:17,162 --> 01:46:21,075
I mean, I just don't know
what could have
possibly gone wrong.

2062
01:46:21,166 --> 01:46:22,747
Everything was going smoothly.

2063
01:46:22,835 --> 01:46:24,791
The dress looked fantastic.
It had come in from Paris.

2064
01:46:25,170 --> 01:46:27,411
Dougie was being
great and very helpful.

2065
01:46:27,506 --> 01:46:32,125
I had organized everything
to the last final detail.

2066
01:46:32,219 --> 01:46:33,675
I just...

2067
01:46:33,846 --> 01:46:35,507
I don't know
what's happened to her.

2068
01:46:35,723 --> 01:46:37,839
I don't know.
You should know, right?

2069
01:46:37,933 --> 01:46:41,221
You're her best friend.
It's weird that
you don't know.

2070
01:46:41,395 --> 01:46:42,635
You guys are so close.

2071
01:46:46,734 --> 01:46:50,226
Annie, I want to
apologize to you personally

2072
01:46:50,362 --> 01:46:53,104
for all of the things
that have gone down.

2073
01:46:53,198 --> 01:46:55,109
I know that I hurt you,

2074
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:57,691
and that I created a distance
between you and Lillian.

2075
01:46:57,786 --> 01:46:59,617
I want to
apologize for that...
I don't want to hear...

2076
01:46:59,705 --> 01:47:01,241
...and everything
that happened

2077
01:47:01,373 --> 01:47:02,909
at the shower.
And with Las Vegas...

2078
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:04,786
Okay, I don't want
to hear any more,
honestly.

2079
01:47:04,877 --> 01:47:06,959
I don't even
want to talk to you.

2080
01:47:07,588 --> 01:47:09,829
Harry never really
wants to talk to me, either.

2081
01:47:09,924 --> 01:47:12,631
He travels a lot.
Like, all year.

2082
01:47:12,718 --> 01:47:15,334
I'm basically just by myself.

2083
01:47:15,429 --> 01:47:18,466
I don't want to...
I don't feel sorry for you.

2084
01:47:19,642 --> 01:47:21,382
I really liked
that original dress

2085
01:47:21,518 --> 01:47:23,224
you picked at
the bridal store.

2086
01:47:23,312 --> 01:47:26,224
I thought it was beautiful.
You have really lovely taste.

2087
01:47:26,315 --> 01:47:29,773
Thanks, but it's
a little too late for that.

2088
01:47:29,944 --> 01:47:31,104
And I know...

2089
01:47:31,195 --> 01:47:34,153
I don't think
that Brazilian food
really gave us food poisoning.

2090
01:47:34,239 --> 01:47:35,228
No, it did.

2091
01:47:35,407 --> 01:47:36,362
No, I don't think it did.

2092
01:47:36,450 --> 01:47:38,441
It was the food.
I shit my pants
on the way home.

2093
01:47:38,535 --> 01:47:39,945
I don't think it
was your fault.

2094
01:47:40,496 --> 01:47:42,236
That was my fault.

2095
01:47:43,123 --> 01:47:45,785
I think people just
ask me to their weddings

2096
01:47:45,918 --> 01:47:48,580
because I'm good at
organizing parties.

2097
01:47:50,673 --> 01:47:53,415
I don't have any
female friends.

2098
01:47:54,468 --> 01:47:55,958
I'm so sorry.

2099
01:47:56,345 --> 01:47:58,461
Why are you smiling, Annie?

2100
01:47:58,639 --> 01:48:00,300
It's just...
It's just...

2101
01:48:00,474 --> 01:48:02,931
It's the first time I've
ever seen you look ugly.

2102
01:48:03,102 --> 01:48:04,842
And that makes
me kind of happy.

2103
01:48:05,604 --> 01:48:08,971
I look ugly? No, I don't.
I don't really look ugly.

2104
01:48:09,066 --> 01:48:11,352
A little bit.
You're an ugly crier,
but that's okay.

2105
01:48:11,443 --> 01:48:13,149
No, I'm not really
an ugly crier.

2106
01:48:13,362 --> 01:48:14,818
Maybe just
a little bit.
No.

2107
01:48:14,989 --> 01:48:16,320
Just a little bit.

2108
01:48:17,199 --> 01:48:19,155
It's just my makeup.

2109
01:48:19,326 --> 01:48:21,362
But I still look pretty good.

2110
01:48:24,957 --> 01:48:26,163
Rhodes!

2111
01:48:27,459 --> 01:48:28,448
Rhodes.

2112
01:48:29,169 --> 01:48:30,454
Rhodes.

2113
01:48:31,630 --> 01:48:33,086
Come on! Rhodes!

2114
01:48:33,382 --> 01:48:34,872
He's ignoring you.
Let me.
Yes, he is.

2115
01:48:34,967 --> 01:48:36,958
Officer!
Roll down your window!

2116
01:48:37,136 --> 01:48:40,003
Excuse me! Please!

2117
01:48:41,056 --> 01:48:43,763
Rhodes,
I know you can hear me,
and I know you're mad at me,

2118
01:48:44,184 --> 01:48:46,550
but I need your help. Please!

2119
01:48:49,398 --> 01:48:51,059
You know this guy?

2120
01:49:00,242 --> 01:49:01,322
What are you doing?

2121
01:49:01,410 --> 01:49:03,025
I just want to
get his attention.

2122
01:49:04,329 --> 01:49:06,411
Annie! Oh, my God.

2123
01:49:09,168 --> 01:49:10,954
Reckless driving!

2124
01:49:13,255 --> 01:49:16,998
Annie, my hair!
What are you doing?

2125
01:49:17,134 --> 01:49:19,341
I'm speeding!
You better pull me over!

2126
01:49:22,514 --> 01:49:23,549
Really?

2127
01:49:23,724 --> 01:49:25,555
Here comes
the litter-bug!

2128
01:49:30,064 --> 01:49:32,020
Let's see what
Marmaduke's doing.

2129
01:49:32,316 --> 01:49:34,773
Just texting.
Talking on the phone
while I'm driving.

2130
01:49:34,860 --> 01:49:37,351
Not even using my hands.
Oh, hi!

2131
01:49:39,448 --> 01:49:40,437
Mmm! Yum! Yum!

2132
01:49:40,657 --> 01:49:42,147
Beer!

2133
01:49:42,284 --> 01:49:43,273
Yum! Yum! Yum!

2134
01:49:44,036 --> 01:49:45,071
Idiot.

2135
01:49:47,414 --> 01:49:49,279
Hey, what's up, man?

2136
01:49:59,510 --> 01:50:01,626
I don't care. I don't care.

2137
01:50:07,142 --> 01:50:09,758
I'm going to hurl.
I feel really sick, Annie!

2138
01:50:11,522 --> 01:50:13,763
Hey, who's driving that car?

2139
01:50:16,527 --> 01:50:17,562
Can we go up now?

2140
01:50:18,529 --> 01:50:20,394
That's not clever.

2141
01:50:20,739 --> 01:50:21,819
Hey!

2142
01:50:21,907 --> 01:50:23,397
I'm topless!

2143
01:50:24,701 --> 01:50:26,191
I'm totally topless.

2144
01:50:35,754 --> 01:50:36,960
Really?

2145
01:50:39,049 --> 01:50:40,914
Wow. Unbelievable.

2146
01:50:41,260 --> 01:50:42,966
What the fuck are you doing?

2147
01:50:43,137 --> 01:50:44,172
I don't know.

2148
01:50:44,263 --> 01:50:45,799
Hey! Are you crazy?

2149
01:50:46,098 --> 01:50:47,258
Are you crazy?

2150
01:50:47,432 --> 01:50:50,344
All of that stuff,
that would have been
dangerous for a good driver.

2151
01:50:50,602 --> 01:50:53,594
I'm sorry. I just...
I really need your help.

2152
01:50:53,772 --> 01:50:54,887
We can't find Lillian.

2153
01:50:56,275 --> 01:50:57,515
How long has she been gone?

2154
01:50:57,651 --> 01:50:58,891
She's been
missing for 12 hours.

2155
01:50:59,069 --> 01:51:00,309
12 hours?

2156
01:51:00,487 --> 01:51:03,024
It's not a missing person
until it's at least 24 hours.

2157
01:51:03,115 --> 01:51:05,322
Have you ever seen <i>CSI?</i>
24 hours.

2158
01:51:05,784 --> 01:51:07,991
Let me get on
with my job, Annie.

2159
01:51:08,162 --> 01:51:10,904
Nathan, please?

2160
01:51:11,081 --> 01:51:12,116
I really need your help.

2161
01:51:14,209 --> 01:51:15,494
Please, Nathan.

2162
01:51:16,128 --> 01:51:17,117
Who is this one?

2163
01:51:17,588 --> 01:51:18,623
This is Helen.
I'm Helen.

2164
01:51:18,797 --> 01:51:19,957
What?

2165
01:51:20,132 --> 01:51:21,292
It's Helen.

2166
01:51:21,633 --> 01:51:25,626
Hello, Helen.
I've heard wonderful things.

2167
01:51:28,807 --> 01:51:31,890
Okay, thanks, buddy.
Bye-bye.

2168
01:51:32,060 --> 01:51:33,641
Okay, we've traced
her cell phone

2169
01:51:33,812 --> 01:51:35,393
to the corner of
Craner and Rose.

2170
01:51:36,231 --> 01:51:37,562
Do you know where that is?

2171
01:51:37,649 --> 01:51:39,685
Yes. That is her apartment.

2172
01:51:40,485 --> 01:51:41,645
I thought you said
you looked there.

2173
01:51:41,820 --> 01:51:42,855
We did. We did.
Last night.

2174
01:51:42,988 --> 01:51:44,023
Okay.

2175
01:51:44,323 --> 01:51:47,065
So you're saying
she's at her apartment?
That's what you're telling me?

2176
01:51:47,159 --> 01:51:48,820
She must have gone
back after you left.

2177
01:51:48,911 --> 01:51:50,196
God, that was crazy of her.

2178
01:51:50,454 --> 01:51:51,660
Thank God! Thank you.
Let's go. Let's go.

2179
01:51:51,788 --> 01:51:52,994
Okay.

2180
01:51:56,460 --> 01:51:57,825
We found her!

2181
01:52:01,632 --> 01:52:04,248
I am so sorry.
I didn't mean to
waste your time.

2182
01:52:04,343 --> 01:52:06,174
That's embarrassing.

2183
01:52:07,346 --> 01:52:09,257
Thank you.
No, you are welcome.

2184
01:52:09,348 --> 01:52:11,339
It's this kind of
high-octane stuff

2185
01:52:11,516 --> 01:52:13,507
that really made me
want to become a cop.

2186
01:52:13,852 --> 01:52:15,934
"Missing girl found
at her apartment."

2187
01:52:16,104 --> 01:52:17,514
It's...

2188
01:52:17,689 --> 01:52:19,680
It's adrenalin-pinching.

2189
01:52:22,194 --> 01:52:23,650
It's nice to see you.

2190
01:52:27,699 --> 01:52:30,486
I'm glad that you got
your taillights fixed.

2191
01:52:30,661 --> 01:52:32,572
Means I won't have
to stop you again.

2192
01:52:37,501 --> 01:52:38,536
Okay.

2193
01:52:40,254 --> 01:52:41,869
Annie, let's go.

2194
01:52:43,882 --> 01:52:45,998
Anyway,
go and save your friend
from her apartment.

2195
01:52:46,635 --> 01:52:47,875
Bye-bye.

2196
01:52:48,053 --> 01:52:49,384
Bye.

2197
01:53:17,416 --> 01:53:20,078
Do you mind actually
if I go by myself?

2198
01:53:21,712 --> 01:53:23,577
Sure.
Okay.

2199
01:53:24,798 --> 01:53:26,413
Lil?

2200
01:53:27,592 --> 01:53:29,048
Lillian?

2201
01:53:30,846 --> 01:53:31,835
Lil?

2202
01:53:31,930 --> 01:53:32,919
Go away.

2203
01:53:41,898 --> 01:53:42,933
What happened?

2204
01:53:45,944 --> 01:53:49,107
This whole
wedding is fucked up.

2205
01:53:49,448 --> 01:53:51,734
Helen just took
over everything, and

2206
01:53:54,119 --> 01:53:55,700
everything's got
out of control.

2207
01:53:55,787 --> 01:53:58,654
And my dad can't
afford the wedding.

2208
01:53:59,624 --> 01:54:03,082
This has been really
hard to do without you.

2209
01:54:04,171 --> 01:54:07,083
It's been shitty.

2210
01:54:09,301 --> 01:54:10,916
I'm sorry.

2211
01:54:11,928 --> 01:54:13,793
Nope. I'm sorry.

2212
01:54:14,306 --> 01:54:16,092
I'm sorry I kicked
you out of my wedding.

2213
01:54:17,893 --> 01:54:18,973
It's my fault.

2214
01:54:19,061 --> 01:54:20,096
No, it's my fault.

2215
01:54:20,187 --> 01:54:23,099
I think I'm the one
with the mental problems.

2216
01:54:23,315 --> 01:54:24,521
Yeah, wasn't it my
turn to be crazy?

2217
01:54:24,649 --> 01:54:25,889
The bride's
supposed to be crazy.

2218
01:54:25,984 --> 01:54:26,973
Yes, technically.

2219
01:54:27,235 --> 01:54:29,977
You kind of
stole all the crazy.
I out-crazied you.

2220
01:54:32,240 --> 01:54:33,650
Everything's
going to be okay.

2221
01:54:33,909 --> 01:54:36,116
Yeah? How do you know that?

2222
01:54:39,122 --> 01:54:41,659
I left the rehearsal
dinner last night.

2223
01:54:41,833 --> 01:54:43,949
I told Dougie I
had to go get Q-tips.

2224
01:54:44,127 --> 01:54:45,492
And

2225
01:54:46,588 --> 01:54:49,705
all of a sudden,
I realized I was
driving here.

2226
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:50,880
I came here.

2227
01:54:53,595 --> 01:54:57,759
I realized this
is the last time
I'm going to be here

2228
01:54:57,933 --> 01:54:59,639
in this apartment

2229
01:54:59,810 --> 01:55:01,050
with that couch,

2230
01:55:01,436 --> 01:55:02,676
and this bed,

2231
01:55:02,854 --> 01:55:04,765
and take a bath in my bathtub.

2232
01:55:04,940 --> 01:55:06,771
Because you know
how much I love my bathtub.

2233
01:55:07,025 --> 01:55:07,980
It's a good tub.

2234
01:55:08,110 --> 01:55:10,726
I slept in there on my
30th birthday, remember?
Uh-huh.

2235
01:55:11,822 --> 01:55:13,483
Everything's gonna change.

2236
01:55:15,033 --> 01:55:16,989
I mean, I'm not
going to get to

2237
01:55:17,119 --> 01:55:19,030
live five
minutes away from you.

2238
01:55:22,207 --> 01:55:23,822
And it makes me so sad.

2239
01:55:28,338 --> 01:55:29,327
Well, don't be.

2240
01:55:29,965 --> 01:55:32,923
Don't be sad.
Because things
are going to change,

2241
01:55:33,009 --> 01:55:36,467
but they'll be better.

2242
01:55:38,181 --> 01:55:39,387
You know?

2243
01:55:39,766 --> 01:55:43,350
You're gonna take
this huge, great,
beautiful step.

2244
01:55:44,354 --> 01:55:46,640
And Dougie loves you
more than anything.

2245
01:55:47,816 --> 01:55:48,976
And so do I.

2246
01:55:53,113 --> 01:55:55,775
But what about you?
What's gonna happen to you?

2247
01:56:01,580 --> 01:56:03,787
I'm gonna be fine.

2248
01:56:06,251 --> 01:56:08,958
So don't worry, okay?
I'm gonna be...

2249
01:56:09,129 --> 01:56:10,744
I'm gonna be fine.

2250
01:56:11,089 --> 01:56:12,625
I am fine.

2251
01:56:16,261 --> 01:56:19,674
And besides, you need
to blaze the trail for me.

2252
01:56:19,848 --> 01:56:22,760
And then report back
and tell me what's coming.

2253
01:56:23,643 --> 01:56:25,804
Whatever you say, boss.

2254
01:56:28,273 --> 01:56:30,184
All right, let's get
your dress on,

2255
01:56:30,317 --> 01:56:32,273
okay, and let's go
to your wedding.

2256
01:56:33,945 --> 01:56:35,526
Oh, yeah.

2257
01:56:36,406 --> 01:56:37,771
That's the other problem.

2258
01:56:48,210 --> 01:56:52,294
Don't you dare laugh.

2259
01:57:00,222 --> 01:57:01,257
Okay.

2260
01:57:01,348 --> 01:57:03,555
I cannot wear this dress!

2261
01:57:03,808 --> 01:57:05,298
Okay, don't panic.

2262
01:57:06,478 --> 01:57:07,968
This is a nightmare.

2263
01:57:08,813 --> 01:57:10,349
We'll fix it.

2264
01:57:10,649 --> 01:57:12,185
We'll tweak it.

2265
01:57:12,859 --> 01:57:14,395
I will not let you
walk down that aisle

2266
01:57:14,486 --> 01:57:16,351
unless you look
perfect and beautiful,
I promise.

2267
01:57:16,655 --> 01:57:19,818
Do you have a chainsaw
and a blowtorch?

2268
01:57:22,619 --> 01:57:24,905
I think this wedding
is gonna be a disaster.

2269
01:57:24,996 --> 01:57:26,076
No, don't say that.

2270
01:57:26,456 --> 01:57:28,412
If Helen had anything
to do with this wedding,

2271
01:57:28,500 --> 01:57:32,084
it is going to be perfect
and tasteful and beautiful.

2272
01:57:32,170 --> 01:57:33,159
That's true.

2273
01:57:34,256 --> 01:57:36,998
Will you, Douglas,
take Lillian to be your wife?

2274
01:57:37,217 --> 01:57:40,175
Will you love her,
comfort her, and keep her

2275
01:57:40,345 --> 01:57:43,257
and, forsaking all others,
remain true to her

2276
01:57:43,348 --> 01:57:45,339
as long as you
both shall live?

2277
01:57:45,433 --> 01:57:46,468
I do.

2278
01:57:46,810 --> 01:57:49,347
And will you,
Lillian, take Douglas
to be your husband?

2279
01:57:49,437 --> 01:57:51,769
Will you love him,
comfort him, and keep him

2280
01:57:51,940 --> 01:57:53,225
as long as you
both shall live?

2281
01:57:54,526 --> 01:57:55,857
I do.

2282
01:57:57,696 --> 01:57:59,857
By the powers
vested in me
by the state of Illinois,

2283
01:58:00,115 --> 01:58:01,855
I pronounce you
husband and wife.

2284
01:58:02,117 --> 01:58:03,197
You may now kiss the bride.

2285
01:58:14,087 --> 01:58:15,623
Ladies and gentlemen,

2286
01:58:15,714 --> 01:58:20,128
here with us tonight is
Lillian's favorite band
singing her favorite song.

2287
01:58:20,302 --> 01:58:24,545
Put your hands
together for
Wilson Phillips!

2288
01:58:28,810 --> 01:58:29,799
Hi, everybody!

2289
01:58:32,314 --> 01:58:33,554
How we doing tonight?

2290
01:58:34,107 --> 01:58:36,063
I am not paying
for this shit.

2291
01:58:38,153 --> 01:58:39,393
Really?

2292
01:58:41,072 --> 01:58:42,437
It's the last one,
I promise.

2293
01:58:42,532 --> 01:58:44,238
The last one.
The last one.

2294
01:58:44,909 --> 01:58:47,821
<i>I know this pain</i>

2295
01:58:49,164 --> 01:58:53,248
<i>Why do you lock yourself</i>
<i>up in these chains?</i>

2296
01:58:55,086 --> 01:58:58,374
<i>No one can change</i>
<i>your life except for you</i>

2297
01:58:59,674 --> 01:59:04,088
<i>Don't ever let</i>
<i>anyone step all over you</i>

2298
01:59:04,596 --> 01:59:08,214
<i>Just open your</i>
<i>heart and your mind</i>

2299
01:59:09,768 --> 01:59:12,601
<i>Is it really fair to feel</i>

2300
01:59:13,313 --> 01:59:15,178
<i>This way inside</i>

2301
01:59:17,359 --> 01:59:19,600
<i>Someday</i>
<i>somebody's gonna make you</i>

2302
01:59:19,778 --> 01:59:22,019
<i>want to turn</i>
<i>around and say goodbye</i>

2303
01:59:22,113 --> 01:59:24,104
<i>Until then, baby,</i>
<i>are you going to let them</i>

2304
01:59:24,240 --> 01:59:26,196
<i>hold you down</i>
<i>and make you cry?</i>

2305
01:59:26,284 --> 01:59:27,273
<i>Don't you know</i>

2306
01:59:27,452 --> 01:59:29,113
<i>Don't you know</i>
<i>things can change</i>

2307
01:59:29,287 --> 01:59:30,447
<i>Things'll go your way</i>

2308
01:59:30,830 --> 01:59:34,869
<i>If you hold on</i>
<i>for one more day</i>

2309
01:59:35,460 --> 01:59:40,295
<i>Can you hold on</i>
<i>for one more day?</i>

2310
01:59:40,465 --> 01:59:43,798
<i>Things'll go your way</i>

2311
01:59:44,135 --> 01:59:46,842
<i>Hold on for one more day</i>

2312
01:59:56,147 --> 01:59:58,809
<i>You could sustain</i>

2313
02:00:00,151 --> 02:00:03,814
<i>Or are you</i>
<i>comfortable with the pain?</i>

2314
02:00:05,323 --> 02:00:09,817
<i>You've got no one</i>
<i>to blame for your unhappiness</i>

2315
02:00:09,994 --> 02:00:10,949
<i>No, baby</i>

2316
02:00:11,037 --> 02:00:14,325
<i>You got yourself</i>
<i>into your own mess</i>

2317
02:00:15,667 --> 02:00:19,535
<i>Letting your</i>
<i>worries pass you by</i>

2318
02:00:19,713 --> 02:00:20,953
<i>Baby</i>

2319
02:00:21,131 --> 02:00:26,501
<i>Don't you think</i>
<i>it's worth your time</i>
<i>to change your mind?</i>

2320
02:00:26,678 --> 02:00:28,009
<i>No, no</i>

2321
02:00:28,179 --> 02:00:30,340
<i>Someday</i>
<i>somebody's gonna make you</i>

2322
02:00:30,515 --> 02:00:31,630
<i>want to turn</i>
<i>around and say goodbye</i>

2323
02:00:32,851 --> 02:00:34,261
<i>Until then, baby,</i>
<i>are you going to let them</i>

2324
02:00:34,394 --> 02:00:35,850
<i>hold you down</i>
<i>and make you cry?</i>

2325
02:00:36,020 --> 02:00:38,011
What's so funny?

2326
02:00:38,982 --> 02:00:42,691
I put a loaded gun
in Dougie's carry-on.

2327
02:00:43,528 --> 02:00:47,396
The TSA is going to
just rip his ass apart.

2328
02:00:51,244 --> 02:00:52,233
Annie?

2329
02:00:53,913 --> 02:00:54,902
Oh. Hey.

2330
02:00:58,376 --> 02:01:00,332
Did you have
a nice evening?

2331
02:01:00,503 --> 02:01:02,494
It was beautiful. Yeah.

2332
02:01:02,756 --> 02:01:04,872
What did you
think of the wedding?

2333
02:01:05,842 --> 02:01:07,252
It was...

2334
02:01:07,385 --> 02:01:08,374
It was great.

2335
02:01:08,553 --> 02:01:09,668
It was great, right?
Yeah.

2336
02:01:09,888 --> 02:01:11,048
It was perfect.

2337
02:01:11,723 --> 02:01:12,963
It was great.

2338
02:01:13,099 --> 02:01:14,384
Yeah, it was great.

2339
02:01:17,896 --> 02:01:19,852
It was really
nice meeting you.

2340
02:01:20,774 --> 02:01:22,435
Yeah, it was...

2341
02:01:22,609 --> 02:01:25,271
Helen, it was really
nice meeting you, too.

2342
02:01:29,365 --> 02:01:30,980
Hey, you know, maybe

2343
02:01:31,075 --> 02:01:34,738
sometime the three of us
could go to
Rockin' Sushi together.

2344
02:01:36,539 --> 02:01:39,406
Thank you, Annie.

2345
02:01:39,584 --> 02:01:41,245
I would love that.

2346
02:01:47,634 --> 02:01:49,590
Your ride is here.

2347
02:02:05,985 --> 02:02:07,941
Hey, how did everything go?

2348
02:02:10,156 --> 02:02:11,236
Strangely well.

2349
02:02:11,366 --> 02:02:12,446
Good.

2350
02:02:15,453 --> 02:02:17,068
So, I ate your cake

2351
02:02:18,081 --> 02:02:19,491
that you left.

2352
02:02:19,624 --> 02:02:20,613
You did?
Yeah.

2353
02:02:20,834 --> 02:02:22,040
I mean, I had to
fight some raccoons off.

2354
02:02:23,086 --> 02:02:25,293
But that's okay.
I'm pretty strong and tough,

2355
02:02:25,421 --> 02:02:27,628
so it wasn't
much of a contest.

2356
02:02:27,799 --> 02:02:28,879
So that might have been...

2357
02:02:28,967 --> 02:02:30,298
I'm just going to
kiss you now
rather than just...

2358
02:02:43,314 --> 02:02:44,679
<i>Officer Rhodes,</i>
<i>please report to...</i>

2359
02:02:44,774 --> 02:02:45,763
Oh! I'm on duty.

2360
02:02:46,609 --> 02:02:48,224
And I need to
put my uniform on.

2361
02:02:48,319 --> 02:02:50,230
If I drive like this,
they're gonna think
I just stole a car,

2362
02:02:50,321 --> 02:02:51,481
which wouldn't be great.

2363
02:02:52,782 --> 02:02:55,148
You could ride
with me if you want.

2364
02:02:55,326 --> 02:02:57,282
You want to come?
Yeah, I do.

2365
02:02:57,495 --> 02:02:58,530
Come on.

2366
02:02:58,621 --> 02:02:59,610
All right.

2367
02:02:59,789 --> 02:03:00,824
Whoa! Whoa!
Where are you going?

2368
02:03:00,957 --> 02:03:01,992
I'm getting in the car.

2369
02:03:02,083 --> 02:03:03,744
No, no, no, you got
to get in the back.
What?

2370
02:03:03,918 --> 02:03:06,079
You can't sit in the front,
it's against regulations.

2371
02:03:06,170 --> 02:03:08,252
Come on. Come on.

2372
02:03:08,423 --> 02:03:10,129
You're going to make
me sit in the back seat?

2373
02:03:10,341 --> 02:03:11,581
Yeah, come on.

2374
02:03:11,676 --> 02:03:12,756
Sorry. Habit.

2375
02:03:13,094 --> 02:03:14,334
All right.

2376
02:03:14,470 --> 02:03:15,676
It's a force of habit.

2377
02:03:19,475 --> 02:03:20,840
Can I please get
in the front seat?

2378
02:03:21,019 --> 02:03:24,011
Actually, no, I'm afraid
there's a warrant
out for your arrest.

2379
02:03:24,188 --> 02:03:25,849
What? Why?

2380
02:03:25,940 --> 02:03:28,602
Reckless driving,
littering, texting,

2381
02:03:28,776 --> 02:03:30,687
consuming alcohol
while operating a vehicle.

2382
02:03:30,862 --> 02:03:31,897
You didn't
think I was going to

2383
02:03:31,988 --> 02:03:33,569
let you get away
with that, did you?

2384
02:03:34,365 --> 02:03:36,606
Could we put the siren on?
Please?

2385
02:03:39,120 --> 02:03:40,485
Thank you.

2386
02:03:42,457 --> 02:03:44,368
