1
00:02:03,776 --> 00:02:05,710
Narrator:
People are always asking me

2
00:02:05,778 --> 00:02:07,370
if I know Tyler Durden.

3
00:02:07,446 --> 00:02:08,147
Tyler: 3 minutes.

4
00:02:08,147 --> 00:02:09,171
Tyler: 3 minutes.

5
00:02:09,248 --> 00:02:12,342
This is it: ground zero.

6
00:02:12,418 --> 00:02:14,511
Would you like to say a few
words to mark the occasion?

7
00:02:14,586 --> 00:02:15,678
[Muffled]

8
00:02:15,754 --> 00:02:17,551
Narrator: With a gun barrel
between your teeth,

9
00:02:17,623 --> 00:02:19,682
you speak only in vowels.

10
00:02:19,758 --> 00:02:21,020
I can't think
of anything.

11
00:02:21,093 --> 00:02:22,685
For a second
I totally forget

12
00:02:22,761 --> 00:02:25,286
about Tyler's whole
controlled demolition thing,

13
00:02:25,364 --> 00:02:27,525
and I wonder
how clean that gun is.

14
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,362
Tyler: Getting
exciting now.

15
00:02:29,435 --> 00:02:30,459
That old saying,

16
00:02:30,536 --> 00:02:32,697
how you always hurt
the one you love?

17
00:02:32,771 --> 00:02:34,959
Well, it works both ways.

18
00:02:35,093 --> 00:02:35,650
[Police Sirens]

19
00:02:35,727 --> 00:02:37,160
We have front row seats

20
00:02:37,228 --> 00:02:39,253
for this theater
of mass destruction.

21
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,662
The demolitions committee
of Project Mayhem

22
00:02:41,733 --> 00:02:44,167
wrapped the foundation
columns of a dozen buildings

23
00:02:44,235 --> 00:02:47,170
with blasting gelatin.
In 2 minutes,

24
00:02:47,238 --> 00:02:49,172
primary charges
will blow base charges

25
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,502
and a few square blocks

26
00:02:50,575 --> 00:02:53,271
will be reduced
to smoldering rubble.

27
00:02:53,344 --> 00:02:54,402
I know this...

28
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:56,174
because Tyler knows this.

29
00:02:56,247 --> 00:02:57,839
2 1 /2.

30
00:02:57,915 --> 00:02:59,815
Think of everything
we've accomplished.

31
00:02:59,884 --> 00:03:02,876
And suddenly, I realize
that all of this:

32
00:03:02,954 --> 00:03:05,445
the gun, the bombs,
the revolution...

33
00:03:05,523 --> 00:03:08,981
has got something to do with
a girl named Marla Singer.

34
00:03:10,528 --> 00:03:13,554
Bob. Bob had bitch-tits.

35
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:17,624
This was a support group for
men with testicular cancer.

36
00:03:17,702 --> 00:03:20,136
The big moosey
slobbering all over me,

37
00:03:20,204 --> 00:03:21,193
that was Bob.

38
00:03:21,272 --> 00:03:23,433
We're still men.

39
00:03:23,508 --> 00:03:25,499
Yes, we're men.

40
00:03:25,576 --> 00:03:28,010
Men is what we are.

41
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:30,138
8 months ago, Bob's
testicles were removed.

42
00:03:30,214 --> 00:03:33,706
Then hormone therapy.
He developed bitch-tits

43
00:03:33,785 --> 00:03:35,776
because his testosterone
was too high,

44
00:03:35,853 --> 00:03:37,650
and his body
upped the estrogen.

45
00:03:37,722 --> 00:03:38,984
And that was where I fit...

46
00:03:39,057 --> 00:03:40,991
They're gonna have to
open up my pecks again

47
00:03:41,059 --> 00:03:42,083
and drain the fluid.

48
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,991
Narrator: Between those huge,
sweating tits

49
00:03:44,062 --> 00:03:47,429
that hung enormous the way
you'd think of God’s as big.

50
00:03:47,498 --> 00:03:50,592
OK. You cry now.

51
00:03:50,668 --> 00:03:54,160
No, wait. Back up.
Let me start earlier.

52
00:03:54,405 --> 00:03:57,238
For 6 months,
I couldn't sleep.

53
00:03:57,308 --> 00:03:59,868
Echo: I couldn't sleep.
I couldn't sleep.

54
00:03:59,944 --> 00:04:02,105
With insomnia,
nothing's real.

55
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,774
Everything's far away.

56
00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:09,650
Everything's a copy
of a copy of a copy.

57
00:04:12,523 --> 00:04:14,787
When deep space
exploration ramps up,

58
00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:17,555
it'll be the corporations
that names everything:

59
00:04:17,628 --> 00:04:20,119
the I.B.M. Stellar sphere,

60
00:04:20,198 --> 00:04:22,132
the Microsoft Galaxy,

61
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,760
Planet Starbucks.

62
00:04:24,836 --> 00:04:26,463
Gonna need you out of town
a little more this week.

63
00:04:26,537 --> 00:04:27,970
We got some
red flags to cover.

64
00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:29,438
It must've been Tuesday.

65
00:04:29,507 --> 00:04:31,634
He was wearing
his cornflower-blue tie.

66
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:33,802
You want me to deprioritize
my current reports

67
00:04:33,878 --> 00:04:36,278
until you advise
of a status upgrade?

68
00:04:36,347 --> 00:04:38,144
Make these your primary
action items.

69
00:04:38,216 --> 00:04:39,308
Here's
your flight coupons.

70
00:04:39,383 --> 00:04:40,941
Call me from the road
if there's any snags.

71
00:04:41,018 --> 00:04:42,485
Narrator:
He was full of pep.

72
00:04:42,553 --> 00:04:45,750
Must have had
his grandee latte enema.

73
00:04:47,058 --> 00:04:49,652
Like so many others,
I had become a slave

74
00:04:49,727 --> 00:04:51,991
to the IKEA
nesting instinct.

75
00:04:52,063 --> 00:04:55,965
Uh, yes. I'd like to order
the Erica Pekkary dust ruffles.

76
00:04:56,033 --> 00:04:57,000
Operator: Please hold.

77
00:04:57,068 --> 00:04:58,330
If I saw something clever

78
00:04:58,402 --> 00:05:01,394
Like a little coffee table
in the shape of a yin-yang,

79
00:05:01,472 --> 00:05:03,269
I had to have it.

80
00:05:03,341 --> 00:05:06,174
The Klipske
personal of fice unit,

81
00:05:06,244 --> 00:05:08,712
the Hovetrekke
home exert-bike,

82
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:10,440
or the Johannshamn sofa

83
00:05:10,515 --> 00:05:12,779
with the Strinne green
stripe pattern.

84
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,784
Even the Rizlampa wire lamps

85
00:05:14,852 --> 00:05:17,946
of environmentally friendly
unbleached paper.

86
00:05:18,022 --> 00:05:19,853
I'd flip through catalogs
and wonder:

87
00:05:19,924 --> 00:05:23,951
What kind of dining set
defines me as a person?

88
00:05:24,028 --> 00:05:25,393
I had it all.

89
00:05:25,463 --> 00:05:26,657
Even the glass dishes

90
00:05:26,731 --> 00:05:28,631
with tiny bubbles
and imperfections.

91
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:31,793
Proof  that they were crafted
by the honest, simple,

92
00:05:31,869 --> 00:05:33,632
hard-working indigenous
peoples of --

93
00:05:33,704 --> 00:05:34,636
Operator: Please hold.

94
00:05:34,705 --> 00:05:35,637
Narrator: Wherever.

95
00:05:35,706 --> 00:05:37,003
I was holding.

96
00:05:37,074 --> 00:05:39,668
We used to read pornography.

97
00:05:39,744 --> 00:05:41,803
Now it was
the Horchow collection.

98
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:44,871
No, you can't
die from insomnia.

99
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:46,041
What about narcolepsy?

100
00:05:46,117 --> 00:05:49,052
I nod of f. I wake up
in strange places.

101
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,678
I have no idea
how I got there.

102
00:05:50,755 --> 00:05:52,484
You need to lighten up.

103
00:05:52,557 --> 00:05:54,821
Can you please just
get me something?

104
00:05:54,892 --> 00:05:58,089
Narrator: Red and blue Tuenois,
lipstick-red Seconais.

105
00:05:58,162 --> 00:06:02,792
No. You need
healthy natural sleep.

106
00:06:02,867 --> 00:06:06,428
Chew some Valerian root
and get more exercise.

107
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,604
Hey, come on.
I'm in pain.

108
00:06:11,676 --> 00:06:13,439
You wanna see pain?

109
00:06:13,511 --> 00:06:15,240
Swing by First Methodist
Tuesday nights.

110
00:06:15,313 --> 00:06:18,407
See the guys
with testicular cancer.

111
00:06:18,482 --> 00:06:20,109
That's pain.

112
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,718
Chorus: * La la la *

113
00:06:29,794 --> 00:06:32,092
* La la la la la la *

114
00:06:36,033 --> 00:06:37,898
I always wanted 3 kids,

115
00:06:37,969 --> 00:06:39,903
2 boys and a girl.

116
00:06:39,971 --> 00:06:43,873
Mindy wanted
2 girls and a boy.

117
00:06:43,941 --> 00:06:46,876
We never could
agree on anything.

118
00:06:46,944 --> 00:06:48,912
Well, uh,
you know, she--

119
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,540
She had her first child
last week, a...

120
00:06:51,616 --> 00:06:53,345
a girl.

121
00:06:53,417 --> 00:06:56,978
With--With her, uh,
with her new husband.

122
00:06:57,054 --> 00:06:59,420
Man: [Whispering] Fuck.

123
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:03,586
Hey--Hey, thank God,
you know.

124
00:07:03,661 --> 00:07:06,027
I'm--I'm glad for her.

125
00:07:06,097 --> 00:07:10,466
Because she deserves it.

126
00:07:10,534 --> 00:07:13,094
Group Leader: Aw.

127
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:16,731
Everyone, let's thank Thomas
for sharing himself with us.

128
00:07:16,807 --> 00:07:19,105
All: Thank you, Thomas.

129
00:07:19,176 --> 00:07:22,441
I look around this room,
and I see a lot of  courage,

130
00:07:22,513 --> 00:07:24,606
and that gives me strength.

131
00:07:24,682 --> 00:07:27,048
We give each other strength.

132
00:07:27,118 --> 00:07:29,052
It's time
for the one-on-ones.

133
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,918
So let's all of  us here
follow Thomas' good example

134
00:07:31,989 --> 00:07:34,423
and really open ourselves up.

135
00:07:34,492 --> 00:07:36,790
Would you find a partner?

136
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:41,294
Narrator: And this is how
I met the big moosey...

137
00:07:41,365 --> 00:07:43,492
Man: Come on.
Let's go over here.

138
00:07:43,567 --> 00:07:46,798
His eyes already
shrink-wrapped in tears...

139
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:52,475
knees together,
those awkward little steps.

140
00:07:57,381 --> 00:07:58,473
My name is Bob.

141
00:07:58,549 --> 00:07:59,982
Bob.

142
00:08:00,051 --> 00:08:02,576
Narrator: Bob had been
a champion body-builder.

143
00:08:02,653 --> 00:08:04,587
You know that
chest-expansion program

144
00:08:04,655 --> 00:08:07,749
you see on late-night TV ?
That was his idea.

145
00:08:07,825 --> 00:08:09,588
I was a juicer.

146
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:13,255
You know,
using steroids.

147
00:08:13,331 --> 00:08:16,061
Diabonal and...

148
00:08:16,133 --> 00:08:18,601
Wistrol.
Oh, they use that

149
00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:21,934
on racehorses,
for Christ sakes.

150
00:08:22,006 --> 00:08:24,770
And now I'm bankrupt.

151
00:08:24,842 --> 00:08:26,935
I'm divorced.

152
00:08:27,011 --> 00:08:30,447
My 2 grown kids...

153
00:08:30,514 --> 00:08:34,314
won't even return
my phone calls.

154
00:08:34,385 --> 00:08:36,080
Narrator: Strangers
with this kind of honesty

155
00:08:36,153 --> 00:08:38,678
make me go
a big rubbery one.

156
00:08:41,025 --> 00:08:43,459
Go ahead, Cornelius.

157
00:08:43,527 --> 00:08:44,755
You can cry.

158
00:08:56,707 --> 00:08:59,733
[Crying]

159
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:03,246
Narrator: And then,
something happened.

160
00:09:03,314 --> 00:09:04,747
I let go.

161
00:09:04,815 --> 00:09:06,282
That's really good.

162
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:08,341
Lost in oblivion...

163
00:09:08,419 --> 00:09:11,582
dark and silent

a little bit

709
00:32:25,048 --> 00:32:26,481
about Tyler Durden.

710
00:32:26,583 --> 00:32:29,051
Tyler was a night person.

711
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:30,313
While the rest of us
were sleeping,

712
00:32:30,387 --> 00:32:31,411
he worked.

713
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:34,616
He had one part-time job
as a projectionist.

714
00:32:34,691 --> 00:32:36,488
See, a movie doesn't come
all on one big reel.

715
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,720
It comes on a few.

716
00:32:37,794 --> 00:32:40,285
So someone has to be there
to switch the projectors

717
00:32:40,363 --> 00:32:42,593
at the exact moment
that one reel ends

718
00:32:42,666 --> 00:32:43,928
and the next one begins.

719
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,991
If you look for it,
you can see these little dots

we call them
"cigarette burns."

724
00:32:51,675 --> 00:32:53,734
That's the cue
for a changeover.

725
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:55,243
He flips the projectors,

726
00:32:55,312 --> 00:32:57,177
the movie keeps
right on going,

727
00:32:57,247 --> 00:32:58,714
and nobody in the audience
has any idea.

728
00:32:58,782 --> 00:33:01,273
Why would anyone want
this shit-job?

729
00:33:01,351 --> 00:33:04,249
Because it affords him other
interesting opportunities.

730
00:33:04,383 --> 00:33:06,351

of pornography

of Tyler's contribution
to the film.

Really.

1346

To make soap,
first we render fat.

The salt balance
has to be just right,

1348

so the best fat for making
soap comes from humans.

As the fat renders, the tallows
float to the surface.

If you were then to add
sodium nitrate

and a dash of sawdust,
you got dynamite.

01:02:01,585 --> 01:02:03,746
Bodies burned. Water seeped
into the wood and ashes

1375
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:05,481
to create lye.

1376
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:07,853
This is lye,
the crucial ingredient.

Once it mixed with the
melted fat of bodies,

01:21:41,961 --> 01:21:42,893
Meet me in the back.

1787
01:21:42,962 --> 01:21:44,395
Hey, don't fuck around.

1788
01:21:44,464 --> 01:21:45,692
Meet me in the back.

1789
01:21:45,765 --> 01:21:47,892
Narrator: On a long enough
time line,

1790
01:21:47,967 --> 01:21:50,333
the survival rate
for everyone drops to zero.

1791
01:21:51,471 --> 01:21:53,439
What are you doing?
Come on.

1792
01:21:53,506 --> 01:21:54,871
Hands behind your back.

1793
01:21:54,941 --> 01:21:55,873
God.

1794
01:21:55,942 --> 01:21:57,034
Give me your wallet.

1795
01:21:58,311 --> 01:21:59,642
Raymond K. Hessel,

1796
01:21:59,712 --> 01:22:02,704
1 320 Southeast Banning,
apartment A.

1797
01:22:02,782 --> 01:22:04,113
Small, cramped basement
apartment, Raymond?

1798
01:22:04,183 --> 01:22:05,207
How did you know?

1799
01:22:05,285 --> 01:22:06,912
Because they give
shitty basement apartments

1800
01:22:06,986 --> 01:22:08,920
Letters instead of numbers.

1801
01:22:08,988 --> 01:22:10,421
Raymond...

1802
01:22:10,490 --> 01:22:11,923
you're going to die.

1803
01:22:11,991 --> 01:22:13,458
[Crying]
Oh, my God, no...

1804
01:22:13,526 --> 01:22:14,720
Is that your mom and dad?

1805
01:22:14,794 --> 01:22:16,284
Mom and dad are going
to have to call up

1806
01:22:16,362 --> 01:22:17,351
kindly Dr. So-And-So

1807
01:22:17,430 --> 01:22:18,829
to pick up
your dental records.

1808
01:22:18,898 --> 01:22:20,092
You want to know why?

1809
01:22:20,166 --> 01:22:21,895
Because there's going to be
nothing left of your face.

1810
01:22:21,968 --> 01:22:23,731
- Aw, come on.
- [Crying]

1811
01:22:23,803 --> 01:22:26,237
An expired community college
student I.D.

1812
01:22:26,306 --> 01:22:27,739
What'd you study, Raymond?

1813
01:22:27,807 --> 01:22:29,365
S-S-S-Stuff.

1814
01:22:29,442 --> 01:22:30,841
Stuff?

1815
01:22:30,910 --> 01:22:33,037
Were the midterms hard?

1816
01:22:33,112 --> 01:22:34,079
[Whimpering]

1817
01:22:34,147 --> 01:22:35,512
I asked you
what you studied.

1818
01:22:35,581 --> 01:22:36,707
Biology, mostly.

1819
01:22:36,783 --> 01:22:37,909
Why?

1820
01:22:37,984 --> 01:22:39,884
I--I don't know.

1821
01:22:39,952 --> 01:22:43,353
What did you want to be,
Raymond K. Hessel?

1822

[Click]

1823
01:22:44,824 --> 01:22:46,951
The question, Raymond,

1824
01:22:47,026 --> 01:22:50,416
was what did you
want to be?

1825
01:22:50,550 --> 01:22:52,381
Answer him,
Raymond! Jesus!

1826
01:22:52,452 --> 01:22:53,851
Veterinarian!
Veterinarian!

1827
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:54,978
Animals.

1828
01:22:55,054 --> 01:22:56,988
Yeah, animal s-s-s--

1829
01:22:57,056 --> 01:22:58,080
Stuff.
Yeah, I got that.

1830
01:22:58,157 --> 01:22:59,215
That means you have to
get more schooling.

1831
01:22:59,292 --> 01:23:00,725
Too much school.

1832
01:23:00,793 --> 01:23:02,158
Would you rather be dead?

1833
01:23:02,228 --> 01:23:03,160
No...

1834
01:23:03,229 --> 01:23:04,457
Would you
rather die, here,

1835
01:23:04,530 --> 01:23:05,963
on your knees,

1836
01:23:06,032 --> 01:23:07,829
in the back
of a convenience store?

1837
01:23:07,900 --> 01:23:09,458
[Whimpering]
No...No, please...

1838
01:23:09,535 --> 01:23:10,797
no...

[Releases Hammer]

1840
01:23:14,073 --> 01:23:15,631
I'm keeping your license.

1841
01:23:16,909 --> 01:23:18,467
Gonna check in on you.

1842
01:23:18,544 --> 01:23:20,478
I know where you live.

1843
01:23:20,546 --> 01:23:23,481
If you’re not on your way
to becoming a veterinarian

1844
01:23:23,549 --> 01:23:25,176
in 6 weeks,
you will be dead.

1845
01:23:25,251 --> 01:23:26,980
[Whimpering]

1846
01:23:27,053 --> 01:23:28,884
Now run on home.

1847
01:23:33,659 --> 01:23:35,957
Run, Forrest, run!

1848
01:23:37,597 --> 01:23:38,962
I feel ill.

1849
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:42,233
Imagine how he feels.

1850
01:23:42,301 --> 01:23:44,235
Come on,
this isn't funny!

1851
01:23:44,303 --> 01:23:45,736
That wasn't funny.

1852
01:23:45,805 --> 01:23:47,830
What the fuck
was the point of that?

1853
01:23:47,907 --> 01:23:49,340
Tomorrow will be
the most beautiful day

1854
01:23:49,408 --> 01:23:50,841
of  Raymond K. Hessel's life.

1855
01:23:50,910 --> 01:23:52,343
His breakfast
will taste better

1856
01:23:52,411 --> 01:23:55,312
than any meal you and I
have ever tasted.

1857
01:23:56,849 --> 01:23:59,443
Narrator: You had to
give it to him.

1858
01:23:59,519 --> 01:24:00,850
Come on.

1859
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:01,887
He had a plan.

1860
01:24:01,954 --> 01:24:03,888
And it started
to make sense

1861
01:24:03,956 --> 01:24:05,321
in a Tyler sort of way.

1862
01:24:05,391 --> 01:24:06,380
No fear.

1863
01:24:06,459 --> 01:24:08,393
No distractions.

1864
01:24:08,461 --> 01:24:11,828
The ability to let
that which does not matter

1865
01:24:11,898 --> 01:24:13,866
truly slide.

1866
01:24:26,012 --> 01:24:27,639
You're not your job.

1867
01:24:29,882 --> 01:24:33,147
You're not how much money
you have in the bank.

1868
01:24:34,887 --> 01:24:37,651
You're not
the car you drive.

1869
01:24:37,723 --> 01:24:40,317
You're not the contents
of your wallet.

1870
01:24:41,794 --> 01:24:43,819
You're not
your fuckin' khakis.

1871
01:24:46,032 --> 01:24:49,468
You're the all-singing,
all-dancing crap of the world.

1872
01:24:58,511 --> 01:25:01,446
I'll be out of your way
in a sec.

1873
01:25:01,514 --> 01:25:02,981
You don't have to go.

1874
01:25:05,084 --> 01:25:06,176
Whatever.

1875
01:25:07,253 --> 01:25:10,188
No, I mean, uh...

1876
01:25:10,256 --> 01:25:11,484
It's OK.

1877
01:25:20,933 --> 01:25:23,800
Are you still going
to groups?

1878
01:25:23,869 --> 01:25:24,961
Yeah.

1879
01:25:27,139 --> 01:25:28,970
Chloe's dead.

1880
01:25:29,041 --> 01:25:31,737
Ah, Chloe.

1881
01:25:31,811 --> 01:25:33,972
When did that happen?

1882
01:25:34,046 --> 01:25:36,446
do you care?

1883
01:25:36,515 --> 01:25:37,812
I don't know.

1884
01:25:37,883 --> 01:25:40,078
I haven't thought
about it in a while.

1885
01:25:40,152 --> 01:25:42,416
Yeah, well...

1886
01:25:42,488 --> 01:25:45,616
I think it was
a smart move on her part.

1887
01:25:46,759 --> 01:25:48,090
Hey, listen, uh...

1888
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:51,823
what are you getting
out of all this?

1889
01:25:51,897 --> 01:25:53,057
What?

1890
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:55,733
I mean, all this.

1891
01:25:55,801 --> 01:25:57,234
Why do you keep...

1892
01:25:57,303 --> 01:25:59,771
Is this
making you happy?

1893
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:03,465
Yeah, well, sometimes.

1894
01:26:04,910 --> 01:26:07,344
I don't know.
I don't understand.

1895
01:26:07,413 --> 01:26:09,347
Why does
a weaker person

1896
01:26:09,415 --> 01:26:11,849
need to latch on to
a strong person?

1897
01:26:11,917 --> 01:26:13,179
What is that?

1898
01:26:13,252 --> 01:26:15,379
Well, what do you
get out of it?

1899
01:26:17,323 --> 01:26:19,257
No--It's--It's not
the same thing at all.

totally different with us.

1902

Us?

1903
01:26:23,562 --> 01:26:25,359
What do you mean by "us"?

1904
01:26:25,431 --> 01:26:27,160
I'm sorry,
do you hear this?

1905
01:26:27,233 --> 01:26:28,257
Hear what?

1906
01:26:28,334 --> 01:26:30,302
You're not hearing
all that noise?

1907
01:26:30,369 --> 01:26:31,301
Just--Hold on a second.

1908
01:26:31,370 --> 01:26:32,530
No, wait.
What were you saying?

1909
01:26:32,605 --> 01:26:34,266
Don't change the subject.
I want to talk about this.

1910

You're not talking
about me, are you?

No. What?

That day you came over
to my place to play doctor--

what was going on there?

What are you
talking about?

Nothing. Nothing.

I don't think so.

Come on,
what do you want?

1918

- Look at me.
- No. What?

Oh, my God.

if it’s a guy or a girl?

What do you care
if I ask?

business. Leave me alone.

tell him he's too young.

First rule of  Project Mayhem

2122

is you do not ask questions.

What are you talking about?

Why didn't you include me
in the beginning?

01:38:01,977 --> 01:38:03,501
Fight Club
was the beginning.

Yeah. I thought we were
doing this together.

01:52:14,474 --> 01:52:15,406
[Dial Tone]

2434
01:52:16,609 --> 01:52:18,372
You broke
your promise.

2435
01:52:18,444 --> 01:52:19,433
Jesus, Tyler.

2436
01:52:19,512 --> 01:52:21,173
You fuckin' talked
to her about me.

2437
01:52:21,247 --> 01:52:22,976
Tyler, what the fuck
is going on here?

2438
01:52:23,049 --> 01:52:24,744
I asked you
for one thing,

2439
01:52:24,817 --> 01:52:26,512
one simple thing.

2440
01:52:26,586 --> 01:52:27,780
Why do people
think that I'm you?

2441
01:52:29,455 --> 01:52:30,649
Answer me!

2442
01:52:34,394 --> 01:52:35,326
Sit.

2443
01:52:38,731 --> 01:52:39,663
Now answer me.

2444
01:52:39,732 --> 01:52:41,222
Why do people think
that I'm you?

2445
01:52:42,535 --> 01:52:43,524
I think you know.

2446
01:52:43,603 --> 01:52:45,127
No, I don't.

2447
01:52:45,204 --> 01:52:46,262
Yes, you do.

2448
01:52:46,339 --> 01:52:49,001
Why would anyone possibly
confuse you with me?

2449
01:52:50,176 --> 01:52:52,906
Uh...l...
I don't know.

2450
01:52:56,716 --> 01:52:58,081
You got it.

2451
01:52:58,151 --> 01:52:59,584
No.

2452
01:52:59,652 --> 01:53:00,619
Do not
fuck with us.

2453
01:53:00,687 --> 01:53:01,876
Say it.

2454
01:53:03,378 --> 01:53:05,141
Because...

2455
01:53:06,581 --> 01:53:07,639
Say it.

2456
01:53:09,550 --> 01:53:11,415
Because we're
the same person.

2457
01:53:11,486 --> 01:53:13,647
That's right.

2458
01:53:13,721 --> 01:53:15,882
We are the all-singing,
all dancing--

2459
01:53:15,957 --> 01:53:17,481
I don't
understand this.

2460
01:53:17,558 --> 01:53:18,490
You were looking
for a way

2461
01:53:18,559 --> 01:53:19,685
to change your life.

2462
01:53:19,761 --> 01:53:22,059
You could not do this
on your own.

2463
01:53:22,130 --> 01:53:24,030
All the ways you wish
you could be,

2464
01:53:24,098 --> 01:53:25,656
that's me.

2465
01:53:26,734 --> 01:53:27,996
I look like
you wanna look,

2466
01:53:28,069 --> 01:53:29,229
I fuck like
you wanna fuck,

2467
01:53:29,304 --> 01:53:30,669
I am smart,
capable,

2468
01:53:30,738 --> 01:53:32,899
and most importantly,
I am free

2469
01:53:32,974 --> 01:53:34,498
in all the ways
that you are not.

2470
01:53:34,575 --> 01:53:35,564
Oh, no.

2471
01:53:35,643 --> 01:53:36,575
Tyler's not here.

2472
01:53:36,644 --> 01:53:37,576
Tyler went away.

2473
01:53:37,645 --> 01:53:38,577
- Tyler's gone.
- What?

2474
01:53:38,646 --> 01:53:40,079
This is
impossible.

2475
01:53:40,148 --> 01:53:41,706
- No.
- This is crazy.

2476
01:53:41,783 --> 01:53:43,114
People do it
every day.

2477
01:53:43,184 --> 01:53:44,515
They talk
to themselves.

2478
01:53:44,585 --> 01:53:46,746
They see themselves
as they'd like to be.

2479
01:53:46,821 --> 01:53:48,755
They don't have
the courage you have,

2480
01:53:48,823 --> 01:53:50,017
to just
run with it.

2481
01:53:53,861 --> 01:53:55,726
Naturally, you're still
wrestling with it,

2482
01:53:55,797 --> 01:53:57,264
so sometimes
you're still you.

2483
01:53:57,332 --> 01:53:59,129
We should do this
again sometime.

2484
01:53:59,200 --> 01:54:02,067
Other times, you imagine
yourself watching me.

2485
01:54:02,136 --> 01:54:03,467
If this is your first
night at Fight Club,

2486
01:54:03,538 --> 01:54:04,630
you have to fight.

2487
01:54:04,706 --> 01:54:06,037
Little by little,

2488
01:54:06,107 --> 01:54:09,406
you’re just letting
yourself become...

2489
01:54:09,477 --> 01:54:11,877
Tyler Durden.

2490
01:54:11,946 --> 01:54:12,970
You are not
your job,

2491
01:54:13,047 --> 01:54:14,742
or how much money
you have in the bank!

2492
01:54:14,816 --> 01:54:15,976
No, you have
a house.

2493
01:54:16,050 --> 01:54:17,244
Rented in your name.

2494
01:54:17,318 --> 01:54:19,252
You have jobs, you
have a whole life.

2495
01:54:19,320 --> 01:54:20,912
You have night jobs
because you can't sleep.

2496
01:54:20,989 --> 01:54:22,820
Or you stay up
and make soap.

2497
01:54:22,890 --> 01:54:24,414
Marla--You're
fucking Marla, Tyler.

2498
01:54:24,492 --> 01:54:26,460
Uh, technically,
you're fucking Marla.

2499
01:54:26,527 --> 01:54:27,824
But it's
all the same to her.

2500
01:54:30,164 --> 01:54:31,654
Oh, my God.

2501
01:54:32,734 --> 01:54:34,725
Now you see
our dilemma.

2502
01:54:34,802 --> 01:54:36,827
She knows too much.

2503
01:54:37,972 --> 01:54:39,030
I think we're going
to have to talk

2504
01:54:39,107 --> 01:54:42,304
about how this might
compromise our goals.

2505
01:54:42,377 --> 01:54:45,403
Wh--What are
you saying?

2506
01:54:45,480 --> 01:54:47,141
This is--
This is bullshit.

2507
01:54:47,215 --> 01:54:48,705
This is bullshit.

2508
01:54:48,783 --> 01:54:49,750
I'm not listening
to this.

2509
01:54:49,817 --> 01:54:50,749
You are insane.

2510
01:54:50,818 --> 01:54:52,649
No, you're insane.

2511
01:54:52,720 --> 01:54:55,245
And we simply do not
have time for this crap.

2512
01:54:57,825 --> 01:54:59,690
It's called
a changeover.

2513
01:54:59,761 --> 01:55:01,285
The movie goes on,

2514
01:55:01,362 --> 01:55:02,795
and nobody
in the audience

2515
01:55:02,864 --> 01:55:04,422
has any idea.

2516
01:55:17,412 --> 01:55:18,344
Woman: Sir!

2517
01:55:18,413 --> 01:55:19,744
Are you checking out?

2518
01:55:19,814 --> 01:55:21,008
Yeah, uh,
b-bill me.

2519
01:55:21,082 --> 01:55:22,743
I need you to
initial this list

2520
01:55:22,817 --> 01:55:23,909
of phone calls,
please.

2521
01:55:27,922 --> 01:55:29,082
When were
these made?

2522
01:55:29,157 --> 01:55:30,351
It says
right there, sir,

2523
01:55:30,425 --> 01:55:31,983
between 2:00 and 3:30
this morning.

2524
01:55:32,060 --> 01:55:33,391
No, I w--

2525
01:55:37,298 --> 01:55:38,356
Have I been
going to bed

2526
01:55:38,433 --> 01:55:39,695
earlier
every night?

2527
01:55:39,767 --> 01:55:41,792
Have I been
sleeping later?

2528
01:55:43,771 --> 01:55:46,797
Have I been Tyler
longer and longer?

2529
01:55:50,344 --> 01:55:51,276
Is anybody here?

2530
01:55:54,348 --> 01:55:57,181
Déjà vu
all over again.

2531
01:55:58,252 --> 01:55:59,184
Yeah, with
enough soap,

2532
01:55:59,253 --> 01:56:00,652
we could blow up
just about anything.

2533
01:56:03,825 --> 01:56:05,850
Oh, my God.

2534
01:56:08,963 --> 01:56:09,930
Man On Telephone:
1 888.

2535
01:56:09,997 --> 01:56:11,259
I'm sorry,
who am I calling?

2536
01:56:11,332 --> 01:56:13,300
1 888 Franklin.
This is Maintenance.

2537
01:56:15,403 --> 01:56:16,836
Hello?

2538
01:56:16,904 --> 01:56:17,836
Hello?

2539
01:56:17,905 --> 01:56:19,770
1 888 Franklin Street?

2540
01:56:19,841 --> 01:56:22,935
Yes.
Can I help you?

2541
01:56:25,246 --> 01:56:26,873
Hello?

2542
01:56:26,948 --> 01:56:28,074
Yeah, yeah.

2543
01:56:28,149 --> 01:56:29,411
Uh, I need to talk
to your supervisor

2544
01:56:29,484 --> 01:56:30,416
right away.

2545
01:56:30,485 --> 01:56:31,417
Speaking.

2546
01:56:31,486 --> 01:56:32,418
OK, listen to me.

2547
01:56:32,487 --> 01:56:33,681
I think something
really terrible

2548
01:56:33,754 --> 01:56:34,721
is about to happen
at your building.

2549
01:56:34,789 --> 01:56:35,778
You have got--

2550
01:56:35,857 --> 01:56:37,085
It's under
control, sir.

2551
01:56:38,459 --> 01:56:39,426
Excuse me?

2552
01:56:39,494 --> 01:56:41,052
Don't worry
about us, sir.

2553
01:56:41,129 --> 01:56:42,528
We're solid.

2554
01:56:46,167 --> 01:56:47,464
Man On Telephone:
21 60.

2555
01:56:55,409 --> 01:56:56,433
Marla!
Marla!

2556
01:56:56,511 --> 01:56:58,502
Hey--Fuck!--Wait!

2557
01:56:59,580 --> 01:57:01,275
Wait, I gotta
talk to you!

2558
01:57:01,349 --> 01:57:02,509
Marla, Marla!

2559
01:57:02,583 --> 01:57:03,675
Your whacked-out
bald freaks

2560
01:57:03,751 --> 01:57:05,218
hit me with
a fucking broom!

2561
01:57:05,286 --> 01:57:06,947
They almost
broke my arm!

2562
01:57:07,021 --> 01:57:08,648
They were burning their
fingertips with lye,

2563
01:57:08,723 --> 01:57:09,712
the stink was
unbelievable.

2564
01:57:09,790 --> 01:57:10,722
Look--Look,
listen,

2565
01:57:10,791 --> 01:57:11,723
it's gonna take
a tremendous act

2566
01:57:11,792 --> 01:57:12,724
of faith
on your part,

2567
01:57:12,793 --> 01:57:13,760
but you've got
to hear me out.

2568
01:57:13,828 --> 01:57:15,728
Oh, here comes
an avalanche of bullshit.

2569
01:57:15,796 --> 01:57:17,263
A little more faith
than that.

2570
01:57:21,636 --> 01:57:22,568
No, listen,
I don't want to hear

2571
01:57:22,637 --> 01:57:23,569
anything
you have to say.

2572
01:57:23,638 --> 01:57:25,697
You have every
right to be...

2573
01:57:25,773 --> 01:57:27,832
Um, I'll just have
a coffee, thanks.

2574
01:57:27,909 --> 01:57:30,844
Sir, anything you order
is free of charge, sir.

2575
01:57:30,912 --> 01:57:32,971
Why is it
free of charge?

2576
01:57:33,047 --> 01:57:34,139
Don't--Don't ask.

2577
01:57:34,215 --> 01:57:35,273
Whatever.

2578
01:57:35,349 --> 01:57:37,977
I'll have the clam chowder,
the fried chicken

2579
01:57:38,052 --> 01:57:39,144
with the baked potato
with everything,

2580
01:57:39,220 --> 01:57:40,687
and a chocolate
chiffon pie.

2581
01:57:40,755 --> 01:57:42,848
Clean food, please.

2582
01:57:42,924 --> 01:57:44,687
In that case, sir,
may I advise against

2583
01:57:44,759 --> 01:57:45,987
the lady eating
the clam chowder?

2584
01:57:46,060 --> 01:57:48,051
No clam chowder,
thank you.

2585
01:57:50,264 --> 01:57:51,788
You've got
about 30 seconds.

2586
01:57:54,535 --> 01:57:55,467
Marla, I know that
I've been acting

2587
01:57:55,536 --> 01:57:56,730
very, very strange.

2588
01:57:56,804 --> 01:57:58,965
OK, I know that
it's got to seem

2589
01:57:59,040 --> 01:58:00,098
Like there's
2 sides to me--

2590
01:58:00,174 --> 01:58:01,106
2 sides?

2591
01:58:01,175 --> 01:58:02,472
You're Dr.Jekyll
and Mr.Jackass.

2592
01:58:02,543 --> 01:58:03,475
I deserve that,
but--

The full extent
of our relationship

going to go into,

thing is, I know

2915
02:14:42,271 --> 02:14:44,705
Hi, Marla.

2916
02:14:45,775 --> 02:14:46,742
Leave her
with me,

2917
02:14:46,809 --> 02:14:47,741
get your stuff,

2918
02:14:47,810 --> 02:14:48,742
I'll meet you
downstairs.

2919
02:14:48,811 --> 02:14:49,743
Are you sure?

2920
02:14:49,812 --> 02:14:51,780
Yes, I'm sure.

2921
02:14:52,949 --> 02:14:54,917
You fucker!

2922
02:14:54,984 --> 02:14:55,916
What kind of sick
fucking game

2923
02:14:55,985 --> 02:14:56,917
are you
playing now,

2924
02:14:56,986 --> 02:14:57,918
putting me
on a fucking bu--

2925
02:14:57,987 --> 02:14:59,887
Oh, my God,
your face!

2926
02:14:59,956 --> 02:15:01,389
Yeah, I know.

2927
02:15:06,195 --> 02:15:08,129
What happened?

2928
02:15:08,197 --> 02:15:09,357
Don't ask.

2929
02:15:09,432 --> 02:15:10,364
You're shot.

2930
02:15:10,433 --> 02:15:11,798
Yes, I'm shot.

2931
02:15:11,868 --> 02:15:13,392
Oh, my God.

2932
02:15:13,469 --> 02:15:14,902
I can't believe
he's standing.

2933
02:15:14,971 --> 02:15:16,404
One tough
motherfucker.

2934
02:15:20,276 --> 02:15:22,141
Who did this?

2935
02:15:22,211 --> 02:15:24,736
I did, actually.

2936
02:15:24,814 --> 02:15:26,213
Find some gauze.

2937
02:15:28,217 --> 02:15:30,276
You shot
yourself?

2938
02:15:30,353 --> 02:15:31,411
Yes, but it's OK.

2939
02:15:31,487 --> 02:15:33,045
Marla, look at me.

2940
02:15:33,122 --> 02:15:35,386
I'm really OK.

2941
02:15:35,458 --> 02:15:37,426
Trust me.

2942
02:15:37,493 --> 02:15:39,222
Everything's
gonna be fine.

2943
02:15:52,308 --> 02:15:54,105
You met me at
a very strange time

2944
02:15:54,177 --> 02:15:55,439
in my life.

2945
02:15:57,480 --> 02:15:58,970
*With your feet
on the air*

2946
02:15:59,048 --> 02:16:01,539
*And your head
on the ground *

2947
02:16:04,787 --> 02:16:09,121
*Try this trick
and spin it, yeah *

2948
02:16:10,326 --> 02:16:12,089
*Your head'll
collapse *

2949
02:16:12,161 --> 02:16:13,890
* if there's
nothing in it *

2950
02:16:13,963 --> 02:16:15,225
*And you'll ask
yourself*

2951
02:16:15,998 --> 02:16:17,156
*Where is my mind? *

2952
02:16:17,156 --> 02:16:18,851
*Where is my mind? *

2953
02:16:18,925 --> 02:16:20,893
*Where is my mind? *

2954
02:16:20,960 --> 02:16:24,896
*Where is my mind? *

2955
02:16:32,872 --> 02:16:38,936
*Way out in the water,
see it swimming *

2956
02:16:44,750 --> 02:16:48,481
* I was swimming
in the Caribbean *

2957
02:16:51,457 --> 02:16:56,895
*Animals were hiding
behind the rock*

2958
02:16:56,963 --> 02:16:59,056
* Except for little fish *

2959
02:16:59,131 --> 02:17:00,462
*When they told me
east is west *

2960
02:17:00,533 --> 02:17:02,694
*Trying to talk
to me, coy koi *

2961
02:17:02,768 --> 02:17:05,737
*Where is my mind? *

2962
02:17:05,805 --> 02:17:07,705
*Where is my mind? *

2963
02:17:07,773 --> 02:17:12,176
*Where is my mind? *

2964
02:17:19,518 --> 02:17:26,287
*Way out in the water,
see it swimming *

2965
02:17:39,605 --> 02:17:40,970
*With your feet
on the air*

2966
02:17:41,040 --> 02:17:43,634
*And your head
on the ground *

2967
02:17:46,646 --> 02:17:50,446
*Try this trick
and spin it, yeah *

2968
02:17:52,151 --> 02:17:55,678
*Your head'll collapse
if there's nothing in it *

2969
02:17:55,755 --> 02:17:57,814
*And you'll ask yourself*

2970
02:17:57,890 --> 02:18:00,415
*Where is my mind? *

2971
02:18:00,493 --> 02:18:02,757
*Where is my mind? *

2972
02:18:02,828 --> 02:18:07,060
*Where is my mind? *

2973
02:18:14,373 --> 02:18:20,937
*Way out in the water,
see it swimming *
