1
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:22,947
Shit!

2
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:47,470
Andrew, hey.

3
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:51,967
Here you go.
Your regular lattes.

4
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:56,209
Literally saved my life.
Thank you. Thank you.

5
00:02:10,863 --> 00:02:11,921
- Everyone OK?
- Yeah.

6
00:02:11,964 --> 00:02:14,228
- Yeah.
- Me too.

7
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:18,967
Hello, Frank? How's my favorite writer?

8
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:20,666
Of course you've been
thinking about our talk

9
00:02:20,706 --> 00:02:22,367
because you know I'm right.

10
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:24,308
Frank, people in this
country are busy, broke,

11
00:02:24,343 --> 00:02:26,436
and they hate to read.
They need someone they can trust to say,

12
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,811
"Hey! Don't watch
<i>CSl: Indianapolis</i> tonight.

13
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:32,249
Read a book! Read Frank's book."
And that person is Oprah.

14
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,319
- Cuttin' it close.
- One of those mornings.

15
00:02:39,358 --> 00:02:40,848
Thank you, Captain Obvious.

16
00:02:40,893 --> 00:02:43,157
Sweet...

17
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:44,857
- Uh, sorry.
...Jesus!

18
00:02:44,897 --> 00:02:46,797
Rub some dirt on it, brother.

19
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:50,291
Frank, the truth is all
A-plus novelists do publicity.

20
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:54,035
Roth, McCourt, Russo, and...

21
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:56,974
Frank! Can I tell you what else
they have in common? A Pulitzer.

22
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,611
I need the shirt off
your back. Literally.

23
00:02:59,645 --> 00:03:03,103
- You're kidding, right?
- Yankees, Boston, this Tuesday,

24
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:05,549
two company seats for your shirt.
You have five seconds to decide.

25
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:07,246
Five, four, three, two, one.

26
00:03:07,286 --> 00:03:08,776
I know...

27
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:11,085
- Shh!
- Later.

28
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:18,160
Uh-oh.

29
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:28,030
Uh, hello. Hello?

30
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:36,647
Morning, boss. You have a
conference call in 30 minutes.

31
00:03:36,682 --> 00:03:38,650
Yes. About the marketing
of the spring books. I know.

32
00:03:38,684 --> 00:03:40,049
Staff meeting at 9:00.

33
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:41,644
Did you call, um...
What's her name?

34
00:03:41,687 --> 00:03:44,121
The one with the ugly hands.

35
00:03:44,156 --> 00:03:45,180
- Janet.
- Yes, Janet.

36
00:03:45,224 --> 00:03:46,623
Yes. I did call her. I told her that

37
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,354
if she doesn't get her
manuscript in on time

38
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,794
you won't give her a release date.
Your immigration lawyer called.

39
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:51,956
He said it's imperative...

40
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:53,659
Cancel the call, push
the meeting to tomorrow

41
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:55,132
and keep the lawyer on the sheets.

42
00:03:55,167 --> 00:03:56,634
Oh, and get a hold of PR,

43
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:58,102
have them start drafting
a press release.

44
00:03:58,137 --> 00:03:59,604
Frank is doing <i>Oprah.</i>

45
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:02,164
Wow. Nicely done.

46
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:05,405
If I want your praise,
I will ask for it.

47
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,414
Um...

48
00:04:09,448 --> 00:04:11,109
Who is, uh, who is Jillian?

49
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,846
And why does she want me to call her?

50
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:18,990
Well, that was originally my cup.

51
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:20,993
And I'm drinking your coffee why?

52
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:23,052
Because your coffee spilled.

53
00:04:28,734 --> 00:04:32,568
So, you drink unsweetened
cinnamon light soy lattes?

54
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,665
I do. It's like Christmas in a cup.

55
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,141
Is that a coincidence?

56
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:39,576
Incredibly, it is.

57
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,773
I mean I wouldn't possibly drink
the same coffee that you drink

58
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:43,441
just in case yours spilled.

59
00:04:43,482 --> 00:04:45,279
That would be pathetic.

60
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:47,343
Morning. Miss Tate's office.

61
00:04:47,386 --> 00:04:48,683
Hey, Bob.

62
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:53,587
Actually, we're headed to
your office right now. Yeah.

63
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:56,390
Why are we headed to Bob's office?

64
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,898
Oop!

65
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:13,903
Have you finished the
manuscript I gave you?

66
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:16,506
Uh, I read a few pages.
I wasn't that impressed.

67
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:17,914
- Can I say something?
- No.

68
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,009
I've read thousands of manuscripts,

69
00:05:20,052 --> 00:05:21,451
and this is the only one
I've given you.

70
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,216
There's an incredible novel in there.

71
00:05:23,255 --> 00:05:25,155
The kind of novel you used to publish.

72
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:28,490
Uh, wrong. And I do think you
order the same coffee as I do

73
00:05:28,527 --> 00:05:31,018
just in case you spill,
which is, in fact, pathetic.

74
00:05:31,063 --> 00:05:32,325
- Or impressive.
- I'd be impressed

75
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:33,593
if you didn't spill in the first place.

76
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:35,066
Now remember, you're
just a prop in here.

77
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,069
Won't say a word.

78
00:05:39,538 --> 00:05:44,475
Ah! Our fearless leader and
her liege. Please, do come in.

79
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,139
Oh. Beautiful breakfront. Is it new?

80
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,206
It is English Regency Egyptian
Revival, built in the 1800s

81
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,083
but, yes, it is new to my office.

82
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,747
Witty.

83
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:58,416
Bob, I'm letting you go.

84
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,052
Pardon?

85
00:06:03,095 --> 00:06:06,189
I asked you over a dozen times to get
Frank to do <i>Oprah,</i> and you didn't do it.

86
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:08,325
You're fired.

87
00:06:10,202 --> 00:06:11,897
I have told you that is impossible.

88
00:06:11,937 --> 00:06:14,337
Frank hasn't done an
interview in 20 years.

89
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:16,068
Well that is
interesting, because I just

90
00:06:16,108 --> 00:06:18,599
got off the phone
with him, and he is in.

91
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,278
Excuse me?

92
00:06:21,313 --> 00:06:22,712
You didn't even call him, did you?

93
00:06:24,116 --> 00:06:25,845
- But...
- I know, I know.

94
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:29,116
Frank can be a little scary
to deal with. For you.

95
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:32,386
Now, I will give you two
months to find another job.

96
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:34,893
And then you can tell
everyone you resigned, OK?

97
00:06:38,964 --> 00:06:41,057
What's his twenty?

98
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,763
He's moving. He has crazy eyes.

99
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:46,897
Don't do it, Bob. Don't do it.

100
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:50,932
You poisonous bitch!

101
00:06:50,976 --> 00:06:52,637
You can't fire me!

102
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:54,976
You don't think I see
what you're doing here?

103
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:56,777
Sandbagging me on this Oprah thing

104
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:58,716
just so that you can
look good to the board?

105
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:01,743
Because you are threatened by me!

106
00:07:01,787 --> 00:07:04,654
- And you are a monster.
- Bob, stop.

107
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:07,989
Just because you have
no semblance of a life

108
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:09,790
outside of this office,

109
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:11,956
you think that you can treat all of us

110
00:07:11,997 --> 00:07:13,658
like your own personal slaves.

111
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:16,259
You know what? I feel sorry for you.

112
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:19,032
Because you know what you're
gonna have on your deathbed?

113
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:21,096
Nothing and no one.

114
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,503
Listen carefully, Bob.

115
00:07:27,546 --> 00:07:31,141
I didn't fire you because
I feel threatened. No.

116
00:07:31,183 --> 00:07:34,584
I fired you because you're
lazy, entitled, incompetent

117
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,281
and you spend more time
cheating on your wife

118
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:37,653
than you do in your office.

119
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,021
And if you say another word,

120
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:41,356
Andrew here is gonna have you
thrown out on your ass, OK?

121
00:07:41,393 --> 00:07:43,918
Another word and you're
going out of here

122
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,225
with an armed escort.

123
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:47,129
Andrew will film it with
his little camera phone

124
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,793
and he will put it
on that Internet site.

125
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:50,062
- What was it?
- YouTube?

126
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:52,536
Exactly. Is that what you want?

127
00:07:52,571 --> 00:07:54,198
Didn't think so. I have work to do.

128
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:58,567
Have security take his
breakfront out of his office

129
00:07:58,611 --> 00:07:59,737
and put it in my conference room.

130
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:00,803
Will do.

131
00:08:00,846 --> 00:08:01,938
And I need you around this weekend

132
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,346
to help review his files
and his manuscript.

133
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:05,976
- This weekend?
- You have a problem with that?

134
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:08,043
No. I... just my
grandmother's 90th birthday,

135
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:09,486
so I was gonna go home and...

136
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,319
...it's fine. I'll cancel it.

137
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:13,291
You're actually saving me from
a weekend of misery anyway,

138
00:08:13,325 --> 00:08:15,623
so it's... good talk, yeah.

139
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:20,758
I know, I know. OK, tell
Gammy I'm sorry. OK? What...

140
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,358
Mom. What do you want me to tell you?

141
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:24,835
She's making me work the weekend.

142
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,167
No, I'm not... no.

143
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:27,763
Listen, I've worked too
hard for this promotion

144
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:28,899
to throw it all away, OK?

145
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:30,431
I'm sure that Dad is pissed,

146
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:33,377
but we take all of our submissions
around here very seriously.

147
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:36,813
We'll get back to
you as soon as we can.

148
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,840
- Was that your family?
- Yes.

149
00:08:38,884 --> 00:08:40,613
- They tell you to quit?
- Every single day.

150
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:43,850
Miss Tate's office.

151
00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:46,585
Oh... Yeah. OK. All right.

152
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,718
Bergen and Malloy want to
see you upstairs immediately.

153
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:51,355
OK. Come get me in ten
minutes. We've got a lot to do.

154
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:52,421
Okey-doke.

155
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,765
Good morning, Miss Tate.

156
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:03,999
Jack, Edwin.

157
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,806
Margaret, congratulations
on the <i>Oprah</i> thing.

158
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:07,710
- That's terrific news.
- Thank you, thank you.

159
00:09:07,746 --> 00:09:10,613
This isn't about my second raise, is it?
Just kidding.

160
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:14,278
Margaret, do you
remember when we agreed

161
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,345
that you wouldn't go to
the Frankfurt Book Fair

162
00:09:16,388 --> 00:09:17,787
because you weren't allowed
out of the country

163
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,723
while your visa application
was being processed?

164
00:09:19,758 --> 00:09:20,782
Yes. I do.

165
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:23,192
And... you went to Frankfurt.

166
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,424
Yes, I did. We were going
to lose DeLillo to Viking.

167
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:27,489
So... really didn't
have a choice, did I?

168
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:28,898
It seems that the
United States Government

169
00:09:28,934 --> 00:09:30,959
doesn't care much who
publishes Don DeLillo.

170
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:33,767
We, uh, just spoke to
your immigration attorney.

171
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:36,434
Great. So, we're all good?
Everything good?

172
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:38,943
Margaret, your visa application
has been denied.

173
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:42,141
And you are being deported.

174
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:43,307
Deported?

175
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:45,044
And apparently there
was also some paperwork

176
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,449
that you didn't fill out in time.

177
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:50,945
Come on. Come on! It's not
like I'm even an immigrant!

178
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,981
I'm from Canada, for Christ's sake.

179
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:55,391
There's gotta be... there's
gotta be something we can do.

180
00:09:55,427 --> 00:09:57,395
We can reapply, but unfortunately

181
00:09:57,429 --> 00:10:00,421
you have to leave the country
for at least a year.

182
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:07,371
OK. OK, well, that's
not ideal, but, uh...,

183
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:09,203
I can, uh... I can manage
everything from Toronto...

184
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:10,401
No, Margaret.

185
00:10:10,442 --> 00:10:11,739
...with videoconferencing
and Internet.

186
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:12,903
Unfortunately, Margaret,

187
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,641
if you're deported,
you can't work for an American company.

188
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:18,081
Until this is resolved I'm going
to turn operations over

189
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,311
to Bob Spaulding.

190
00:10:19,351 --> 00:10:22,013
Bob Spaulding? The guy I just fired?

191
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:23,453
We need an editor in chief.

192
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:25,855
He is the only person in the building
who has enough experience.

193
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:27,722
- You cannot be serious. I beg of you.
- Margaret.

194
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,728
We are desperate to have you stay.

195
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:32,731
If there was any way, any way at all

196
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:34,323
that we could make this work,
we'd be doing it.

197
00:10:34,366 --> 00:10:35,492
There is no way...

198
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:36,558
I am begging you.

199
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:38,229
No, Margaret. Excuse me,
we're in a meeting.

200
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,828
- Sorry to interrupt.
- What? What!

201
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:42,432
Mary from Miss Winfrey's office
called. She's on the line.

202
00:10:42,474 --> 00:10:43,532
- I know.
- She's on hold.

203
00:10:43,575 --> 00:10:46,510
She needs to speak with you right away.
I told her you were otherwise engaged.

204
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:49,105
She insisted, so... sorry.

205
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,775
So...

206
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:02,784
Uh...

207
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:05,430
Come here.

208
00:11:07,866 --> 00:11:11,632
Uh... Gentlemen, I understand.
I understand...

209
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,764
the predicament that we are in.

210
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:16,468
And, um...

211
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:20,574
And there's, uh... well...

212
00:11:20,612 --> 00:11:23,240
I think there's something
that you should know.

213
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:27,984
Uh... we're, uh...
we're getting married.

214
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,113
We are getting married.

215
00:11:30,155 --> 00:11:31,782
- Who is getting married?
- You and I.

216
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:34,588
You and I are getting married! Yes.

217
00:11:34,626 --> 00:11:36,287
- We are.
- Getting married.

218
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:37,761
- We are getting married.
- Yes.

219
00:11:39,531 --> 00:11:41,624
Isn't he your secretary?

220
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:42,725
Assistant.

221
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:46,499
Executive, uh...
assistant secretary. Titles.

222
00:11:46,538 --> 00:11:50,804
But, wouldn't be the first time
one of us fell for our secretaries.

223
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:52,834
Would it, Edwin?

224
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,108
With Laquisha. Remember?

225
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:58,674
So, yeah... The truth is,

226
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:02,847
you know, Andrew and I, we're...
we are just two people

227
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,049
who weren't meant to
fall in love but we did.

228
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,421
No.

229
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:11,486
All those late nights at the
office and weekend book fairs.

230
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:12,588
- Yeah...
- No.

231
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:15,293
- Something happened.
- Something.

232
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:18,462
Yeah. Tried to fight it and...

233
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:20,131
Can't, can't fight a...

234
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:24,632
Can't fight a love like ours, so, uh...

235
00:12:24,676 --> 00:12:28,077
Uh... Are we good with this?
Are you happy?

236
00:12:28,113 --> 00:12:31,981
Because, well... we are happy. So happy.

237
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:33,143
- Margaret.
- Yes?

238
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:35,085
It's terrific.

239
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,849
Just make it legal. Mmm?

240
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:39,517
Oh! Legal.

241
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:42,891
Yeah, well, then...
then that means we...

242
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,226
...we need to get ourselves
to the immigration office.

243
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,892
So we can work this
whole mess out. Right?

244
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,798
Thank you
very much, gentlemen.

245
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:50,893
We will do that right away.

246
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,131
Thank you very much,
gentlemen. Thank you.

247
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:55,402
- Gentlemen.
- Thank you.

248
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,078
Margaret
and Andrew are getting married!

249
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,409
What is that about?

250
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,506
Dragon Lady!
Here they come...

251
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:04,880
Yeah.

252
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:06,680
What is he thinking?

253
00:13:06,718 --> 00:13:07,810
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

254
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:12,516
Dude, for real. Her?

255
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:14,822
Married? Didn't
even know they were dating...

256
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:37,806
What?

257
00:13:39,184 --> 00:13:41,084
I don't understand what's happening.

258
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,088
Relax. This is for you, too.

259
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:44,453
Do explain.

260
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,720
They were going to make Bob chief.

261
00:13:46,758 --> 00:13:48,419
So naturally I would have to marry you.

262
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,052
And what's the problem?

263
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:52,427
Like you were saving yourself
for someone special?

264
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:55,592
I like to think so.
Besides, it's illegal.

265
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:58,831
They're looking for terrorists,
not for book publishers.

266
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:00,395
- Margaret.
- Yes?

267
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:03,499
- I'm not gonna marry you.
- Sure you are.

268
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:06,568
Because if you don't marry me, your
dreams of touching the lives of millions

269
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:08,341
with the written word are dead.

270
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:16,811
Bob is gonna fire you the second
I'm gone. Guaranteed.

271
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:18,914
That means you're out on the street
alone looking for a job.

272
00:14:18,957 --> 00:14:21,448
That means all the time that
we spent together, all the lattes,

273
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:23,688
all the canceled dates,
all the midnight Tampax runs,

274
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:27,028
were all for nothing and all your dreams
of being an editor are gone.

275
00:14:27,065 --> 00:14:29,465
But don't worry, after the required
allotment of time,

276
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:30,968
we'll get a quickie divorce
and you'll be done with me.

277
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:32,834
But until then, like it or not,

278
00:14:32,871 --> 00:14:34,805
your wagon is hitched to mine. OK?

279
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,035
Phone.

280
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,951
- This way.
- Margaret.

281
00:14:52,991 --> 00:14:55,016
- Come.
- The line...

282
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,084
Next, please.

283
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:57,755
Ooh, ooh. Just, uh...

284
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:59,320
Sorry, I just need to ask him something.

285
00:14:59,364 --> 00:15:02,162
I need for you to file this
fiancée visa for me, please.

286
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:09,205
- Miss Tate?
- Yes.

287
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,300
Please, come with me.

288
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:13,903
Yes, ma'am, I understand
that. We're backed up...

289
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,310
I have a bad feeling about this.

290
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:22,351
- Hi. Hello.
- Hello.

291
00:15:22,387 --> 00:15:24,878
Hi. I'm Mr. Gilbertson.

292
00:15:24,923 --> 00:15:26,982
- Ah!
- And you must be Andrew,

293
00:15:27,025 --> 00:15:28,356
- and you must be...
- Margaret.

294
00:15:28,393 --> 00:15:30,190
...Margaret. Sorry about the wait.

295
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:31,890
It's a, uh, crazy day today.

296
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:34,091
Oh, of course, of course. We understand.

297
00:15:34,132 --> 00:15:36,157
And I can't tell you how much
we appreciate you seeing us

298
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:40,262
- on such short notice.
- OK.

299
00:15:40,305 --> 00:15:42,796
<i># Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh</i>
<i>buh, buh, buh, buuuh</i>

300
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:44,672
So, I have one question for you.

301
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,907
Are you both committing fraud
to avoid her deportation

302
00:15:47,946 --> 00:15:52,042
so she can keep her position
as editor in chief at Colden Books?

303
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,712
- That's ridiculous.
- Where did you hear that?

304
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:58,052
We had a phone tip this afternoon
from a man named...

305
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,853
Would it be Bob Spaulding?

306
00:15:59,891 --> 00:16:01,222
Bob Spaulding.

307
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,559
Bob. Poor Bob. I am so sorry.

308
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:08,532
Bob is nothing but a disgruntled
former employee.

309
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:09,659
And I apologize.

310
00:16:09,701 --> 00:16:12,397
But we know you're incredibly busy

311
00:16:12,437 --> 00:16:16,305
with a room full of gardeners
and delivery boys to tend to.

312
00:16:16,341 --> 00:16:17,899
If you just give us our next step,

313
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:19,968
we will be out of your
hair and on our way.

314
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:22,637
Miss Tate, please.

315
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:28,179
Let me explain to you the
process that's about to unfold.

316
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,621
Step one will be a scheduled interview.

317
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:35,184
I'll put you each in a room,
and I'll ask you every little question

318
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:37,195
that a real couple
would know about each other.

319
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:41,427
Step two, I dig deeper.
I look at your phone records,

320
00:16:41,466 --> 00:16:43,798
I talk to your neighbors,
I interview your coworkers.

321
00:16:43,835 --> 00:16:46,269
If your answers don't match up
at every point,

322
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:48,967
you will be deported indefinitely.

323
00:16:49,007 --> 00:16:51,407
And you, young man,
will have committed a felony...

324
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:55,436
...punishable by a fine of $250,000

325
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:59,712
and a stay of five years
in federal prison.

326
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:06,052
So, Andrew.

327
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:09,492
You wanna... you want to talk to me?

328
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:15,129
No?

329
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:19,102
Yes?

330
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,073
The truth is...

331
00:17:28,146 --> 00:17:32,913
Mr. Gilbertson, the truth is...

332
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:34,714
Margaret and I...

333
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:39,457
...are just two people

334
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:42,483
who weren't supposed to fall in love.

335
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:45,057
But did.

336
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:49,095
We couldn't tell anyone we work with

337
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:51,728
because of my big promotion
that I had coming up.

338
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,237
- Promotion?
- Yeah.

339
00:17:53,271 --> 00:17:57,105
- Your?
- We... we both felt, uh...

340
00:17:57,142 --> 00:18:01,272
...that it would be deeply inappropriate
if I were to be promoted to editor.

341
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:03,975
- Editor. Mmm-hmm.
...while we were...

342
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:08,044
So...

343
00:18:08,086 --> 00:18:11,146
Have the two of you told your parents
about your secret love?

344
00:18:11,189 --> 00:18:14,522
Oh, I... impossible.
My parents are dead.

345
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,823
- No brothers or sisters either.
- Gone.

346
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:19,160
Are your parents dead?

347
00:18:19,197 --> 00:18:21,358
- Oh, no, his are very much alive.
- No... very much.

348
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,699
Very much. They're, ah... Well,
we were gonna tell them this weekend.

349
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:28,695
Gammy's 90th birthday, and the whole
family's coming together.

350
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,332
And we thought it'd be a nice surprise.

351
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,400
And where is this
surprise gonna take place?

352
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,537
At Andrew's parents' house.

353
00:18:34,579 --> 00:18:35,705
Where is that located again?

354
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:38,375
Um...
Why am I doing all the talking?

355
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:39,782
It's your parents' house.

356
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:41,251
Why don't you tell him
where it is. Jump in.

357
00:18:42,687 --> 00:18:45,417
- Sitka.
- Sitka.

358
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,482
- Alaska.
- Alaska?

359
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:49,619
You're gonna go to Alaska this weekend?

360
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:53,131
- Yeah.
- Yes, yes.

361
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:56,362
We are going to Alaska.
Alaska, that's where...

362
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:59,302
That's where my little...
that's where my Andrew's from.

363
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,170
OK.

364
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:05,665
Fine. I see how this is gonna go.

365
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:08,645
I will see you both
at 11:00 Monday morning

366
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,648
for your scheduled interview,

367
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:14,083
and your answers better
match up on every account.

368
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,685
- Thank you.
- Hello?

369
00:19:16,721 --> 00:19:18,814
- I'm looking forward to this one.
- We're looking forward to this one.

370
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:19,915
Thank you.

371
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,722
Gonna be fun.
I'll be checking up on you.

372
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:23,785
You got it.

373
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:33,200
OK... so, what's gonna happen is
we will go up there.

374
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:35,263
We will pretend like we're
boyfriend and girlfriend,

375
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:36,899
tell your parents we're engaged.

376
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:38,534
Uh, use the miles for the tickets.

377
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:42,274
I guess I will pop for you to fly first
class. But make sure you use the miles.

378
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:43,645
If we don't get the miles,
we're not doing it.

379
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,616
Oh, and please confirm
the vegan meal, OK?

380
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:47,618
'Cause last time they actually
gave it to a vegan,

381
00:19:47,652 --> 00:19:49,279
and they, uh... forced me to eat

382
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:51,812
this clammy, warm, creamy
salad thing, which was...

383
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,848
Hey, I'm... Why aren't you taking notes?

384
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:56,224
I'm sorry, were you not in that room?

385
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:57,626
What? What?

386
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:01,488
Oh! The thing you said about
being promoted?

387
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,524
Genius! Genius.
He completely fell for it.

388
00:20:03,568 --> 00:20:04,830
I was serious.

389
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,771
I'm looking at a $250,000 fine
and five years in jail.

390
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:09,000
That changes things.

391
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:13,170
- Promote you to editor? No, no way.
- Then I quit, and you're screwed.

392
00:20:13,211 --> 00:20:14,235
Bye-bye, Margaret.

393
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,746
- Andrew!
- It really has been

394
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:19,181
- a little slice of heaven.
- Andrew, Andrew! Fine, fine.

395
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,453
I'll make you editor. Fine.

396
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:26,082
If you do the Alaska weekend
and the immigration interview,

397
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:29,025
I will make you editor. Happy?

398
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,460
- And not in two years. Right away.
- Fine.

399
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:32,986
And you'll publish my manuscript.

400
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,198
Ten thousand copy first...

401
00:20:36,234 --> 00:20:37,792
Twenty thousand copies, first run.

402
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:39,770
And we'll tell my family
about our engagement

403
00:20:39,804 --> 00:20:41,431
when I want and how I want.

404
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:43,771
Now, ask me nicely.

405
00:20:43,808 --> 00:20:44,968
"Ask you nicely" what?

406
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:48,776
Ask me nicely to marry you, Margaret.

407
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:53,841
- What does that mean?
- You heard me. On your knee.

408
00:21:02,994 --> 00:21:04,018
Fine.

409
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,769
- Does this work for you?
- Oh, I like this. Yeah.

410
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:16,967
- Will you marry me?
- No.

411
00:21:17,008 --> 00:21:18,566
Say it like you mean it.

412
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:24,580
- Andrew?
- Yes, Margaret?

413
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:27,710
- Sweet Andrew?
- I'm listening.

414
00:21:27,752 --> 00:21:30,744
Would you please,
with cherries on top, marry me?

415
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:36,020
OK. I don't appreciate the sarcasm,
but I'll do it.

416
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:38,689
- See you at the airport tomorrow.
- Good.

417
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:55,102
So, these are the questions
that INS is gonna ask us.

418
00:21:55,146 --> 00:21:58,138
Now, the good news is is
I know everything about you,

419
00:21:58,183 --> 00:21:59,878
but the bad news is
that you have four days

420
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:04,719
to learn all this about me.
So, you should... probably get studying.

421
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:10,557
You know all the answers
to these questions about me?

422
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:12,620
- Scary, isn't it?
- A little bit.

423
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:15,064
- What am I allergic to?
- Pine nuts.

424
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,034
And the full spectrum of human emotion.

425
00:22:17,068 --> 00:22:19,036
Oh, that's... that was funny.

426
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,867
- Mmm-hmm.
- Umm...

427
00:22:20,905 --> 00:22:23,772
Here's a good one. Do I have any scars?

428
00:22:23,808 --> 00:22:25,708
I'm pretty sure that you have a tattoo.

429
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:27,405
Oh, you're pretty sure?

430
00:22:27,445 --> 00:22:29,811
I'm pretty sure. Two years ago,
your dermatologist called

431
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,782
and asked about a Q-switched laser.

432
00:22:31,816 --> 00:22:33,374
I of course Googled a Q-switched laser

433
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:35,716
and found that they
in fact do remove tattoos.

434
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:37,312
But you canceled your appointment.

435
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,448
So what is it? Tribal ink?

436
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:42,426
Japanese calligraphy? Barbed wire?

437
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:45,293
You know, it's exciting for me
to experience you like this.

438
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,594
Thank you. You're gonna have
to tell me where it is, though.

439
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:49,099
- No, I'm not.
- They're gonna ask.

440
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:51,659
We're done with that question.
We're done with that question.

441
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,898
On to another question.
Let me see, let me see.

442
00:22:53,938 --> 00:22:56,805
Oh, here's one. Whose place do we
stay at, yours or mine?

443
00:22:56,841 --> 00:22:58,240
That's easy. Mine.

444
00:22:58,276 --> 00:23:00,141
And why wouldn't we stay at mine?

445
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:02,669
Because I live at Central Park West.

446
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,649
And you probably live at some
squalid little studio apartment

447
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:08,653
with stacks of yellowed
Penguin Classics.

448
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:11,656
<i> Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>please fasten your seat belts.</i>

449
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:14,284
<i>We are beginning our descent</i>
<i>into Juneau.</i>

450
00:23:14,325 --> 00:23:16,054
Juneau? I thought
we were going to Sitka.

451
00:23:17,328 --> 00:23:21,355
- We are.
- How are we getting to Sitka?

452
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:26,529
Whoa.

453
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:53,793
All right. Here we go.

454
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:58,168
- Oh, there he is!
- Andrew!

455
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:06,704
Hi. Right this way...

456
00:24:10,281 --> 00:24:12,078
- Hi!
- Oh...

457
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,711
- It's so good to see you!
- You're suffocating him, Grace.

458
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:16,653
- Come here.
- Hey, Gammy.

459
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:19,452
Ah, Gammy. How are you doing?
Where's Dad?

460
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:22,187
Oh, you know your father.
He's always working.

461
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:24,593
Never mind about him. Where's your girl?

462
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:27,097
Uh, she's... right there.

463
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,724
- Ah.
- There she is.

464
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:31,736
I guess the word "girl"
is inappropriate.

465
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,101
Annie.

466
00:24:34,205 --> 00:24:35,229
- Hi!
- Hello.

467
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:37,036
- Margaret, this is my mom.
- Oh, hello.

468
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:39,509
Yeah, great. This is my gammy, Annie.

469
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:42,638
- Pleasure.
- Well, hello there.

470
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:47,674
Now, do you prefer being called Margaret
or Satan's Mistress?

471
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:49,584
We've heard it both ways.

472
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:51,418
Actually we've heard it
lots of ways.

473
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,048
She's kidding.

474
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:55,559
Oh! Oh... OK.

475
00:24:55,593 --> 00:24:57,060
Thank you so much for...

476
00:24:57,095 --> 00:24:58,790
allowing me to be a part
of this weekend.

477
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,027
Oh, you're welcome.
We're thrilled to have you.

478
00:25:02,066 --> 00:25:03,795
Let's get you two back to the fort.

479
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:05,962
- OK.
- Oh...

480
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:09,030
- It's so good to see you.
- There we are.

481
00:25:42,907 --> 00:25:44,169
Andrew...

482
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:47,667
Andrew. Andrew!

483
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:52,141
Please, don't do that.

484
00:25:52,183 --> 00:25:55,346
You didn't tell me about all
the family businesses, honey.

485
00:25:55,386 --> 00:25:58,583
He was probably just
being modest, dear.

486
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:00,113
Oh.

487
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:10,693
What are we doing? Shouldn't we
check into our hotel right now?

488
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:13,135
Oh, we canceled your reservation.

489
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:14,604
Family doesn't stay at a hotel.

490
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:16,334
You're gonna stay in our home.

491
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:18,365
Oh, great! Great.

492
00:26:18,409 --> 00:26:19,808
- What?
- God.

493
00:26:19,844 --> 00:26:22,039
You're gonna wanna use your legs
to lift that one.

494
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,913
Andrew! Help her with those.

495
00:26:24,949 --> 00:26:27,440
I'd love to, but she won't let me
do anything.

496
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:30,977
She insists on doing it all herself.
She's one of those... she's a feminist.

497
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:41,426
Come on, sweetie.

498
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:45,495
You see the shoes
that broad was wearing?

499
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:56,172
This is the last of 'em.

500
00:26:57,749 --> 00:26:59,011
- Oh!
- Ooh.

501
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:02,213
- Five second rule.
- Got it!

502
00:27:02,253 --> 00:27:04,585
That will dry right off.

503
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:06,852
Psst! Psst!
I'm not getting on that boat.

504
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:08,756
You don't have to.
See you in a few days.

505
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:11,023
Psst! You know I can't swim.

506
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:13,553
Hence, the boat.

507
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:21,937
Come on.

508
00:27:26,444 --> 00:27:28,412
Come on. Here we go.

509
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:38,384
Looking good, boss.
Take your time, though.

510
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:40,482
Shh.

511
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:47,391
She comes with a lot of baggage.

512
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:48,763
Just gonna give you
a little hand here.

513
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:53,670
Hand off ass! Off ass!

514
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,334
There you go. You're there.

515
00:28:03,614 --> 00:28:07,641
Congratulations.
I'm a hundred years old now.

516
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:36,139
Here we are. We're home.

517
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:40,542
That is your home?

518
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:43,980
Who are you people?

519
00:28:58,336 --> 00:28:59,860
Why did you tell me
you were poor?

520
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:02,737
- I never said I was poor.
- But you never told me you were rich.

521
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:04,969
I'm not rich. My parents are rich.

522
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:07,443
OK, you know what?
That's something only rich people say.

523
00:29:07,478 --> 00:29:09,002
Hey, Andrew! Welcome home!

524
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:11,777
Hi! Mom, what is this?

525
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:14,444
Nothing. It's just a little
welcoming party.

526
00:29:14,485 --> 00:29:15,713
Is that a crime?

527
00:29:15,753 --> 00:29:17,880
Just 50 of our closest
friends and neighbors.

528
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,583
And all excited to meet you.

529
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:21,956
- Oh, good. Good.
- Come on. Come on.

530
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:24,291
- A party?
- Yeah, I guess so.

531
00:29:24,328 --> 00:29:26,956
Come on. Let's go. My grandma's
moving faster than you.

532
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:29,965
Put your back into it.

533
00:29:35,606 --> 00:29:37,801
So nice to meet you,
Margaret. Welcome to Sitka.

534
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:39,833
Jill? Hi. Nice to meet you.
My pleasure.

535
00:29:39,877 --> 00:29:43,040
Why didn't you tell me you were
some kind of Alaskan Kennedy?

536
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:44,139
How could I?

537
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:47,674
We were in the middle of talking about
you for the last three years.

538
00:29:47,718 --> 00:29:49,413
OK, know what? Timeout, OK?

539
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,183
This bickering Bickerson thing
has got to stop.

540
00:29:51,222 --> 00:29:53,213
People need to think that we are
in love. So let's just...

541
00:29:53,257 --> 00:29:54,781
That, that's no problem.
I can do that.

542
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:57,693
I can pretend to be the doting fiancé.
That's easy.

543
00:29:57,728 --> 00:29:59,195
But for you, it's going to require

544
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,630
that you stop snacking on
children while they dream.

545
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:04,362
Very funny. When are you going
to tell them we're engaged?

546
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:05,767
I'll pick the right moment.

547
00:30:05,803 --> 00:30:09,671
Hey, Andrew. Hi!

548
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:12,335
Mrs. McKittrick. How are you?
Nice to see you.

549
00:30:12,376 --> 00:30:14,367
Nice to see you, Mr. McKittrick.
This is Margaret.

550
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:16,277
- Hi. Pleasure.
- Margaret!

551
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,713
Hi, how are you? Pleasure.

552
00:30:17,748 --> 00:30:21,149
So I always wanted to know,
what does a book editor do?

553
00:30:21,185 --> 00:30:23,278
That's a great question, Louise.

554
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:25,721
I'm curious to know the answer myself.

555
00:30:26,824 --> 00:30:28,553
- Hello, Dad.
- Son.

556
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,884
This must be Maggie.

557
00:30:30,928 --> 00:30:32,555
Uh, Margaret.

558
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:36,055
- Joe. Pleasure to meet you.
- Pleasure's mine.

559
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:39,695
So why don't you tell us exactly
what a book editor does.

560
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:43,195
Besides taking writers out
to lunch and getting bombed.

561
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:45,607
Now that sounds like fun.

562
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:47,440
No wonder you like being an editor.

563
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:50,709
No, Louise. Andrew's not an editor,
he's an editor's assistant.

564
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:53,239
Maggie here is the editor.

565
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:54,842
Margaret.

566
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:58,378
- So you're actually...
- Andrew's boss. Yeah.

567
00:30:58,422 --> 00:31:00,049
Well. How about that.

568
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:01,456
Huh.

569
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:03,483
I think I'll get a refill.

570
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:07,028
Charming.

571
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:13,895
That's a hell of
a first impression, Dad.

572
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:15,997
What the hell, Andrew?

573
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,804
You show up here after all this
time with this woman you hated

574
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:20,174
- and now she's your girlfriend?
- We just got here.

575
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,508
Can we wait two seconds

576
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:22,979
before we throw the
kitchen sink at each other?

577
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:26,245
Just never figured you for a guy
who slept his way to the middle.

578
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:27,979
Actually, I'll have you know
that that woman in there

579
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:29,646
is one of the most
respected editors in town.

580
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:30,779
She's your meal ticket,

581
00:31:30,821 --> 00:31:32,288
and you brought her home
to meet your mother.

582
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:36,692
She's not my meal ticket, Dad.
She's my fiancée.

583
00:31:36,727 --> 00:31:39,287
- What'd you say?
- You heard me.

584
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,127
I'm getting married.

585
00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:46,602
- How are you?
- Good, good. Thank you.

586
00:31:46,637 --> 00:31:47,968
Would you care for
some hors d'oeuvres?

587
00:31:48,005 --> 00:31:49,302
No, I'm fine. Thank you very much.

588
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,671
It's a tradition.

589
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:52,369
It's the texture. I'm not a fish person.

590
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,810
- You'll like it.
- You're very sweet.

591
00:31:54,845 --> 00:31:57,439
I think if you'll just taste it.

592
00:31:57,481 --> 00:31:58,880
Thank you so much.

593
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,846
Ladies and gentlemen...

594
00:32:03,888 --> 00:32:06,379
I have a very important
announcement to make.

595
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:08,016
Margaret and I are getting married.

596
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:09,321
It's the paprika.

597
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,725
So sorry.

598
00:32:10,761 --> 00:32:13,559
That's OK. It's wash-and-wear.

599
00:32:15,399 --> 00:32:18,391
Yep. Honey? Where you at?

600
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:20,901
Here it is.

601
00:32:23,874 --> 00:32:25,569
Come on down here, pumpkin.

602
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,407
- All right.
- OK.

603
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:30,005
Oh, look at her. Look at her.

604
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:33,683
Right there, ladies and
gentlemen. There she is.

605
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:36,152
Congratulations, Andrew.

606
00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:37,211
Thank you.

607
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:39,120
Thank you very much.

608
00:32:39,156 --> 00:32:41,716
- Time to celebrate.
- Get the champagne.

609
00:32:44,695 --> 00:32:46,322
So that was your idea
of the perfect time

610
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:47,558
- to tell them we're engaged?
- Mmm.

611
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:49,259
'Cause it was brilliant.
Brilliant timing.

612
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,268
Andrew. Hi.

613
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:55,238
Gert? Oh, my God. Hey, hi. Wow.

614
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:57,707
How you doing? I didn't know
that you were gonna be here.

615
00:32:57,742 --> 00:33:01,007
Your mom probably wanted it to
be a surprise. So... surprise.

616
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:03,536
- Right.
- And...

617
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:06,516
...we're being completely rude. Hi.

618
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:09,747
- Oh, God. This is my ex...
- Hi. I'm Gertrude.

619
00:33:09,787 --> 00:33:12,221
- Oh! Oh, wow. Wow!
- You can call me Gert.

620
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:14,451
Well, congratulations, you guys.

621
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:15,925
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

622
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,484
So did I miss the story?

623
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:19,456
- What story?
- What story?

624
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:21,260
About how you proposed.

625
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:25,633
Oh! How a man proposes says
a lot about his character.

626
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,729
- Yes.
- Yes, it does.

627
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:30,400
I actually would love
to hear the story, Andrew.

628
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:31,567
Would you tell us?

629
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:33,941
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

630
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:35,843
You know what?

631
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:39,873
Actually, Margaret loves
telling this story...

632
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:42,477
so I'm just gonna let her
go ahead and do that.

633
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,715
'Cause I think we
should just sit in rapture.

634
00:33:44,755 --> 00:33:48,054
Huh! Wow, OK.

635
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:51,926
Wow, where to begin... this story.

636
00:33:51,962 --> 00:33:54,954
Well... um, wow.

637
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:57,058
Mmm... yeah.

638
00:33:57,101 --> 00:34:01,970
OK, well, um, Andrew and I...

639
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:04,770
Andrew and I were about to celebrate

640
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:07,403
- our first anniversary together.
- Aw...

641
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:10,278
And I knew that he'd been
itching to ask me to marry him.

642
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:13,511
And he was scared.
Like a little tiny bird.

643
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,951
So I started leaving him
little hints here and there...

644
00:34:15,986 --> 00:34:18,750
...because I knew he wouldn't
have the guts to ask, but...

645
00:34:18,789 --> 00:34:21,622
That's not exactly how it happened.

646
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:23,149
- No? Hmm.
- No. No.

647
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:25,754
I mean, I picked up on
all her little hints.

648
00:34:25,796 --> 00:34:27,821
This woman's about as subtle as a gun.

649
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:30,095
Yeah.

650
00:34:30,134 --> 00:34:31,465
What I was worried about was

651
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:33,367
that she might find this little box...

652
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:36,430
Oh! The decoupage box that he made

653
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:38,635
where he'd taken the time to cut out

654
00:34:38,676 --> 00:34:41,440
tiny, little pictures of himself. Yes.

655
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:45,176
Just pasted all over the
box. Oh! So beautiful.

656
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:47,650
So I opened that beautiful,
little decoupage

657
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:51,553
and out fluttered these tiny,
little hand-cut heart confettis.

658
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:55,685
And once they cleared,
I looked down, and I saw...

659
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:58,388
...the most beautiful, big...

660
00:34:58,429 --> 00:34:59,953
...fat nothing.

661
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:01,362
No ring.

662
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:02,991
- No ring?
- What?

663
00:35:03,033 --> 00:35:06,025
No. But inside that box...

664
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,731
...underneath all that crap...

665
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:10,036
...there was a little
handwritten note...

666
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:13,601
with the address to
a hotel, date, and time.

667
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:15,339
Real Humphrey Bogart-type stuff.

668
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:16,744
Yeah.

669
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,612
Masculine.

670
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:20,514
Anyway, naturally, Margaret thought...

671
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:22,109
I thought he was seeing someone else.

672
00:35:22,153 --> 00:35:24,280
It was a terrible time for me,

673
00:35:24,321 --> 00:35:26,687
but I went to that hotel anyway.

674
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:28,817
I went there and I pounded on the door,

675
00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:30,690
but the door was already unlocked.

676
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:34,596
And as swung open that
door, there he was...

677
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,156
- Standing.
- Kneeling.

678
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,758
- Like a man.
- On a bed of rose petals,

679
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:41,260
in a tuxedo. Your son. Your son.

680
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:44,866
And he was choking back
soft, soft sobs.

681
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:48,174
And when he held back the tears
and finally caught his breath,

682
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:49,270
he said to me...

683
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,371
"Margaret, will you marry me?"

684
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:53,747
And she said, "Yep."
The end. Who's hungry?

685
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,782
That is quite a story.

686
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,723
- Oh, Andy!
- Gorgeous.

687
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:03,192
You are so sensitive.

688
00:36:03,994 --> 00:36:06,986
Hand-cut confetti?

689
00:36:07,031 --> 00:36:09,864
Hey! Let's see a kiss
from you two cuties.

690
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:10,992
Give her a kiss!

691
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:13,094
- No. Come on.
- Oh, yeah.

692
00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:14,161
Come on!

693
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:15,763
OK, all right.

694
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:17,671
OK. Here we go. Ready?

695
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:23,576
What is this? Kiss her on
the mouth like you mean it.

696
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:27,209
- Kiss her. Kiss her!
- Kiss her!

697
00:36:27,251 --> 00:36:31,153
Kiss her! Kiss her!
Kiss her! Kiss her!

698
00:36:31,188 --> 00:36:32,815
OK!

699
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:35,049
- OK. All right.
- OK.

700
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:37,253
- Here we go.
- Mmm-hmm. OK.

701
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:40,760
Oh!

702
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:43,426
Andy! Give her a real kiss!

703
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:46,129
- Gammy.
- A real one!

704
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:47,694
- Yeah.
- You can do it!

705
00:36:47,738 --> 00:36:49,399
Why don't we just do it?
Let's just do it really fast.

706
00:36:50,407 --> 00:36:53,001
Mmmm.

707
00:36:53,043 --> 00:36:55,978
- Mmm.
- Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

708
00:36:56,013 --> 00:36:58,174
- OK.
- Mmm.

709
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,017
Hmm.

710
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,024
I'm so happy for you two!

711
00:37:12,062 --> 00:37:15,429
So happy! So happy!

712
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:17,331
Let's get the champagne!

713
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:20,203
So here we are.

714
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:23,768
This is your bedroom.

715
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:30,970
Wow. Wow, this is, um...
beautiful. And the view.

716
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:32,812
And here's the bed.

717
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:35,648
Wow! Exquisite bed. Exquisite.

718
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:38,655
So... where is Andrew's room?

719
00:37:38,689 --> 00:37:40,623
Oh, sweetie, we're not
under any illusions

720
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:43,525
that you two don't
sleep in the same bed.

721
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:45,825
He'll sleep
in here with you.

722
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:48,229
Oh, great, 'cause we love to snuggle.

723
00:37:48,265 --> 00:37:50,199
- Don't we, honey.
- We're huge snugglers.

724
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:52,464
Oh, my God. What is it?

725
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:56,405
- Calm down, Kevin.
- Whoa! You are cute.

726
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,032
Who is this?

727
00:37:58,075 --> 00:38:01,670
- That's Kevin. I'm sorry, Margaret.
- So cute.

728
00:38:01,712 --> 00:38:03,771
We just rescued him from the pound,

729
00:38:03,814 --> 00:38:05,805
and he's still in training. Sorry.

730
00:38:05,849 --> 00:38:07,817
Just be sure you don't
let him outside,

731
00:38:07,851 --> 00:38:09,648
or the eagles will snatch him.

732
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:11,552
No, don't you listen to her.

733
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:13,386
She's just pulling
your leg, isn't she?

734
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:16,757
By the way, there are extra
towels and linens and things

735
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:17,852
in here if you need them.

736
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:19,726
And if you
get chilly tonight...

737
00:38:19,763 --> 00:38:21,424
...use this.

738
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,194
It has special powers.

739
00:38:23,233 --> 00:38:26,225
Oh, what kind of special powers?

740
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:27,897
I call it the Baby Maker.

741
00:38:27,938 --> 00:38:30,031
OK, well. Then I guess we...

742
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:31,598
...gonna be super careful with that one.

743
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,769
- Yeah, I'm just gonna...
- Don't throw it on the bed.

744
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,779
We'd better turn in.
It's been quite an evening.

745
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:37,542
So good night, everybody.

746
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:38,878
- Good night.
- Good night.

747
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:41,908
- Good night.
- Good night, Gammy.

748
00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:45,115
- Good night.
- Good night.

749
00:38:47,791 --> 00:38:49,850
- Good night.
- Good night, Gammy.

750
00:38:49,893 --> 00:38:51,326
Thank you so much. Sweet dreams.

751
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:53,057
- Bye-bye, now.
- Bye.

752
00:38:56,233 --> 00:38:59,168
So, uh... you haven't
been home in a while.

753
00:38:59,203 --> 00:39:02,502
I haven't had a lot of vacation
time the last three years.

754
00:39:02,539 --> 00:39:04,734
Stop complaining.

755
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:10,272
Um... Don't look, OK?

756
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:12,410
OK.

757
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:14,879
Are your eyes closed?

758
00:39:14,918 --> 00:39:16,215
Completely.

759
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:19,620
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

760
00:39:28,265 --> 00:39:31,962
Those are the pajamas you
decided to bring to Alaska.

761
00:39:32,002 --> 00:39:35,460
Yes, because I was supposed
to be in a hotel alone.

762
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:38,498
- Remember?
- Can we just go to sleep?

763
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,601
- Fine.
- Great.

764
00:40:10,307 --> 00:40:12,502
Well.

765
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:13,805
Looks like I won't be
getting much sleep

766
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:16,369
with the sun streaming in.

767
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:24,243
Thank you.

768
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:47,409
Andrew. Phone.

769
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:50,914
Andrew!

770
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:53,348
Crap. Andrew, Andrew, phone.

771
00:40:53,383 --> 00:40:54,748
Andrew!

772
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,719
Yeah... right.

773
00:41:00,357 --> 00:41:03,884
- Andrew, where is it?
- Purse, side pocket.

774
00:41:08,832 --> 00:41:12,495
Hello. Hello? Hello.

775
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:14,401
Frank! Frank, darling.

776
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:15,496
Darling, Frank.

777
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:17,837
Are you there? Hello? Hello? Oh, crap.

778
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:21,333
I have horrible service, Frank.
Give me just one minute.

779
00:41:21,378 --> 00:41:23,141
Oh, my God! Margaret!

780
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,740
One... one minute.
Frank, hold on just a second.

781
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:26,807
Frank, hold on. No, no, no, no.

782
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:30,715
Frank. Frank, I'm sorry you feel

783
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:33,416
I pressured you into doing Oprah, but...

784
00:41:33,457 --> 00:41:36,915
Of course I want you
to be happy. Yes, yes.

785
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:42,796
Frank. Frank. Frank, darling.
Frank? It's going to be fine.

786
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,960
I can just call them and I can cancel.

787
00:41:49,606 --> 00:41:52,074
You are...
you are so right, Frank.

788
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:54,236
Yes, Frank, of course
I'm listening to you.

789
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:55,939
Yeah... yes.

790
00:41:55,979 --> 00:41:57,571
I love listening to you, Frank.

791
00:41:57,614 --> 00:42:01,175
Shh! Sit. Sit.

792
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:03,645
No, not you, Frank.

793
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,484
No, no.

794
00:42:05,522 --> 00:42:07,251
Frank, if I may get down to it, OK...

795
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:10,818
I think it would be
a mistake to back out.

796
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:14,058
Because, Frank, for so many years...

797
00:42:14,097 --> 00:42:17,555
...you have inspired me with your
beautiful words, and I feel that...

798
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:19,228
Shh! Dog, I'm on the phone.

799
00:42:19,269 --> 00:42:22,170
I think it's time that the world
get to enjoy your words as well.

800
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,730
They are just so rich

801
00:42:23,774 --> 00:42:24,900
with... passion...

802
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:29,606
And I think that we
should all be privy to.

803
00:42:29,646 --> 00:42:31,341
Frank, I just, uh...

804
00:42:31,381 --> 00:42:32,973
I just, uh, want you
to be happy, Frank.

805
00:42:33,016 --> 00:42:35,507
Give me that dog!

806
00:42:35,552 --> 00:42:37,986
Frank, hold on a second.
Can you hold a second?

807
00:42:38,021 --> 00:42:39,045
Give me that dog!

808
00:42:40,757 --> 00:42:42,281
Come on! Come on, come on, come on.

809
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:44,590
Come on! Come on! Oh, oh...

810
00:42:44,628 --> 00:42:47,153
Oh, oh! Oh, oh. OK! OK, gotcha.

811
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:49,028
Frank, Frank.

812
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,260
Frank? So sorry, so sorry.

813
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:53,428
So sorry. I dropped the phone.
Now, listen, Frank.

814
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:56,200
I don't want to sell you on anything,

815
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,037
but this is your legacy, this book.

816
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:59,474
And I think it's up to you to

817
00:42:59,509 --> 00:43:00,533
present your legacy to the world.

818
00:43:00,577 --> 00:43:03,774
And call me tomorrow with your decision.

819
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:05,543
And my phone is on
all the time! OK, bye-bye.

820
00:43:05,582 --> 00:43:06,606
No! Wait!

821
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:10,013
No! No! N-n-n... no. No

822
00:43:10,053 --> 00:43:11,577
Take the doggy. Look at the doggy.

823
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:13,522
I need that phone. Take the dog.

824
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:15,024
Take the dog. I need that phone!

825
00:43:15,058 --> 00:43:18,357
Here. Take the dog.
Take the dog. Take it. Take it.

826
00:43:18,395 --> 00:43:20,386
Look at this.

827
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:24,395
- Is that cute or what?
- I know.

828
00:43:26,403 --> 00:43:29,133
Morning, guys. Have you seen... daah.

829
00:43:29,172 --> 00:43:32,300
She's playing with Kevin.
We thought she didn't like him.

830
00:43:32,342 --> 00:43:33,366
Will you go get her, Andy?

831
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:35,378
We have a whole day planned for her,

832
00:43:35,412 --> 00:43:37,346
and she needs to get ready.

833
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:39,645
Yeah. Tell her we have
a big surprise for her.

834
00:43:39,683 --> 00:43:41,310
Mmm.

835
00:43:43,887 --> 00:43:46,856
Look! Give me my phone. Come on.
Please, just give me my phone.

836
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:49,518
- Come on. Right here.
- What the hell are you doing?

837
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:52,551
Oh, my God. Your grandmother
was completely right.

838
00:43:52,596 --> 00:43:54,393
The eagle came
and tried to take the dog.

839
00:43:54,431 --> 00:43:57,889
But then I saved him. Then it
came back, and it took my phone.

840
00:43:57,935 --> 00:44:00,301
- Are you drunk?
- What? No! I'm serious.

841
00:44:00,337 --> 00:44:02,805
He's got my phone, and Frank's
calling me on that phone.

842
00:44:02,839 --> 00:44:04,170
Relax, all right?

843
00:44:04,207 --> 00:44:07,267
We'll order another phone, same number.
We'll go into town tomorrow and get it.

844
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:08,369
- Really?
- Yeah.

845
00:44:08,412 --> 00:44:13,543
Oh, OK. All right. Well, you go then.

846
00:44:13,583 --> 00:44:15,414
- You have to get ready.
- For what?

847
00:44:15,452 --> 00:44:16,885
You're going out with Mom and the girls.

848
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,582
- I don't want to go out.
- Shopping, sightseeing. And a surprise.

849
00:44:19,623 --> 00:44:21,090
- I hate shopping.
- You'll love it.

850
00:44:21,124 --> 00:44:22,591
- I hate sightseeing.
- You're going.

851
00:44:22,626 --> 00:44:23,888
- No, I don't want to go.
- You're going.

852
00:44:23,927 --> 00:44:25,554
- I'm not going. I'm not going.
- Yes, you are.

853
00:44:25,595 --> 00:44:27,062
Now give me a nice big hug.
We don't want them

854
00:44:27,097 --> 00:44:28,223
- to think we're fighting.
- I don't want to touch you.

855
00:44:28,265 --> 00:44:30,062
- Come on. Hug time.
- No, I don't want to...

856
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,829
- Hug time.
- I don't want to...

857
00:44:31,868 --> 00:44:33,631
There we go.

858
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:36,366
Yeah, that's nice.

859
00:44:36,406 --> 00:44:39,102
Yeah. That's nice.

860
00:44:39,142 --> 00:44:41,702
There we go. Isn't that nice?

861
00:44:41,745 --> 00:44:43,269
- Mmm-hmm.
- Mmm-hmm.

862
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:44,780
- Mmm. Yeah.
- Boop boop boop.

863
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:47,079
If you touch my ass one more time,

864
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:49,278
I will cut your balls
off in your sleep. OK?

865
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:51,150
- Yeah.
- There you go.

866
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:53,850
All righty now. So, uh...
We clear on that?

867
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:56,256
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Such a good fiancé.

868
00:44:56,293 --> 00:44:58,090
Hmm. Ow.

869
00:45:11,541 --> 00:45:14,772
- Jeez.
- You want to see me?

870
00:45:14,811 --> 00:45:17,507
Your mom found these eco-balls.

871
00:45:17,547 --> 00:45:19,412
They dissolve in water.

872
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:23,781
I don't know how she
comes up with this stuff.

873
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:27,779
Anyway, she, uh... is a little peeved.

874
00:45:27,824 --> 00:45:31,817
Apparently, I wasn't the most
gracious of hosts last night.

875
00:45:31,862 --> 00:45:33,159
It was a little bit of a shock

876
00:45:33,196 --> 00:45:34,754
to find out that
you're getting married...

877
00:45:34,798 --> 00:45:38,029
...especially when none of us
even knew you were dating.

878
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:42,869
The point is... I owe you an apology.

879
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:46,669
Accepted.

880
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:49,440
There's something else.

881
00:45:49,479 --> 00:45:53,313
I've been going over my
retirement plans recently,

882
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:54,874
and it got me thinking.

883
00:45:56,586 --> 00:45:58,110
I've done a lot of things in my life.

884
00:45:58,155 --> 00:46:01,852
Practically built an empire with
your mother from the ground up.

885
00:46:01,892 --> 00:46:03,052
It doesn't mean anything unless...

886
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:04,492
Unless you have someone to leave it to.

887
00:46:04,528 --> 00:46:07,964
- We already discussed this.
- I'd like to discuss it again.

888
00:46:07,998 --> 00:46:11,934
You have responsibilities here.

889
00:46:11,968 --> 00:46:13,731
I think I've been
more than understanding

890
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:15,169
about your goofing off in New York.

891
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:16,866
I need you to quit playing around...

892
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:17,965
Here we go again.

893
00:46:18,008 --> 00:46:20,306
When are you going to start
taking what I do seriously?

894
00:46:20,343 --> 00:46:22,208
When you start acting seriously.

895
00:46:22,245 --> 00:46:24,713
I'm sorry.

896
00:46:24,748 --> 00:46:26,716
I feel sorry for you, Dad.

897
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:29,275
I wish you had another son. I really do.

898
00:46:29,319 --> 00:46:30,479
One who wanted to stay here.

899
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:32,283
One who wanted to take over
the family business.

900
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:34,381
One who wanted to marry someone
that you approve of,

901
00:46:34,424 --> 00:46:37,757
but it's not me. Now,
it must seem strange to you,

902
00:46:37,794 --> 00:46:42,731
my life in New York... sitting
in an office, reading books.

903
00:46:42,766 --> 00:46:45,360
But it makes me happy. You understand?

904
00:46:48,538 --> 00:46:51,996
If that's what makes you happy,
son, I got nothing to say.

905
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:54,067
Well, that's a first.

906
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:58,810
You know what? Apology not
accepted. Have fun out here.

907
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:14,620
There is no way you
could leave her at home.

908
00:47:14,664 --> 00:47:16,427
She had to be here. Absolutely.

909
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:18,491
She's been coming here forever.

910
00:47:18,535 --> 00:47:21,299
I hope you are ready
for your big surprise...

911
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:24,637
...because this is one of
Sitka's greatest treasures.

912
00:47:24,674 --> 00:47:26,938
- Right?
- Oh, yes. Oh, yeah.

913
00:47:28,812 --> 00:47:30,279
OK, this is the big surprise

914
00:47:30,313 --> 00:47:33,714
I was telling you about. You ready?

915
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:37,882
Oh, Margaret,
you're gonna love it!

916
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:10,516
Ramone's the only
exotic dancer on the island.

917
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:12,784
But we're lucky to have him.

918
00:48:21,598 --> 00:48:23,122
Work it, Ramone!

919
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:28,570
- Wow.
- Over here, Ramone! Over here.

920
00:48:28,605 --> 00:48:30,072
Over here, honey.

921
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:33,740
Show her what
she's gonna be missing.

922
00:48:33,777 --> 00:48:35,108
Come, my sexy princess.

923
00:48:35,145 --> 00:48:36,840
- Yeah!
- Oh, no. Not necessary.

924
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,747
It's a really nice gesture,
but I really need to just...

925
00:48:39,783 --> 00:48:41,011
Go on, Margaret. Get up there!

926
00:48:41,051 --> 00:48:42,109
You come dance.

927
00:48:42,152 --> 00:48:43,642
OK, pluck my eyes out. OK.

928
00:48:43,687 --> 00:48:47,316
All right. Here we go.

929
00:48:47,357 --> 00:48:49,416
Go, Margaret! Go, Margaret!

930
00:48:49,459 --> 00:48:52,587
Hey.

931
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:53,653
Hey... oh.

932
00:48:53,697 --> 00:48:56,029
Give it to her, Ramone!

933
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:02,704
Go on, Ramone! Give it to her!

934
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:17,382
Ooh, that's a move I haven't seen.

935
00:49:19,522 --> 00:49:22,787
Look at her face!

936
00:49:22,826 --> 00:49:27,024
Guess who.
For you. For you. For you.

937
00:49:27,063 --> 00:49:29,964
- Yeah!
- Enjoy!

938
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:38,139
I don't want to touch it.
No. OK, OK. Very sweet.

939
00:49:38,174 --> 00:49:39,300
No, no, no, no, no.

940
00:49:41,678 --> 00:49:42,770
Smack him!

941
00:49:42,812 --> 00:49:45,212
- I'm sorry?
- Smack his ass.

942
00:49:45,248 --> 00:49:47,216
Smack it. OK.

943
00:49:49,452 --> 00:49:52,888
- Smack him, Margaret!
- Give it to him!

944
00:49:52,922 --> 00:49:56,449
Yeah! Woo!

945
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:58,290
Can I get down now?

946
00:50:09,005 --> 00:50:11,439
Free. Be free.

947
00:50:19,115 --> 00:50:21,845
Hey! There you are.
How are you holding up?

948
00:50:21,885 --> 00:50:26,015
Oh, fine. Fine. Just working on my tan.

949
00:50:26,056 --> 00:50:29,048
Yeah, the Paxtons can be
a bit overwhelming at times.

950
00:50:29,092 --> 00:50:30,218
Yes, yes.

951
00:50:31,328 --> 00:50:33,455
It's a little different
than New York, huh?

952
00:50:33,496 --> 00:50:36,954
Little bit. Little bit. You ever been?

953
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,992
No. That was always
Andrew's dream, not mine.

954
00:50:40,036 --> 00:50:42,402
You guys were pretty serious, huh?

955
00:50:42,439 --> 00:50:45,169
Well, I mean, we dated in high
school and all through college,

956
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:47,301
but we were kids.

957
00:50:49,112 --> 00:50:51,603
And you guys called it off because of...

958
00:50:53,683 --> 00:50:56,015
Well, um...

959
00:50:56,052 --> 00:51:00,716
the night before we graduated
school, he proposed...

960
00:51:00,757 --> 00:51:02,281
...and said he wanted to elope

961
00:51:02,325 --> 00:51:05,089
and run away to New York with me.

962
00:51:05,128 --> 00:51:07,688
And...

963
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,596
You said "no."

964
00:51:09,632 --> 00:51:12,567
And I said "no," yeah.

965
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:16,538
I've never been anywhere
but here. This is home.

966
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:21,374
But anyway... you're a lucky girl.

967
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:26,644
He really is the best, which
you obviously already know.

968
00:51:26,683 --> 00:51:31,450
Oh, yep. Yep, very much so, yeah.

969
00:51:31,488 --> 00:51:34,685
Well, cheers to you guys.

970
00:51:35,692 --> 00:51:39,651
Oh... Thank you.

971
00:51:44,367 --> 00:51:47,234
Looks like Ramone's
wrappin' it up.

972
00:51:48,171 --> 00:51:52,107
Go, Annie!

973
00:51:52,142 --> 00:51:54,201
I've never seen him so...

974
00:51:54,244 --> 00:51:56,303
- No, he really got down.
...out there. I mean...

975
00:51:56,346 --> 00:52:00,544
He was wonderful.

976
00:52:01,050 --> 00:52:02,312
Oh, no.

977
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,956
Andrew!

978
00:52:09,993 --> 00:52:12,257
Andrew, honey, is everything OK?

979
00:52:15,765 --> 00:52:17,596
What... What's he doing?

980
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:20,102
Something's up. It's best
to leave him alone.

981
00:52:20,136 --> 00:52:21,398
Come on, honey.

982
00:52:25,508 --> 00:52:27,533
<i>... Hunt's version</i>
<i>of that here tonight.</i>

983
00:52:27,577 --> 00:52:30,273
Hey, hey, hey. What are you
doing? I'm watching that.

984
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:31,644
Why is Andrew out there

985
00:52:31,681 --> 00:52:34,081
hollowing out that old
stupid canoe again?

986
00:52:34,117 --> 00:52:36,551
Well, maybe he's
planning to escape. What?

987
00:52:36,586 --> 00:52:38,383
I am so tired.

988
00:52:38,421 --> 00:52:40,252
Think I'm gonna go
upstairs, take a shower,

989
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:42,485
wash off Ramone's coconut body oil.

990
00:52:42,525 --> 00:52:43,890
Sure.

991
00:52:43,927 --> 00:52:46,259
I had a great day today. Thank you.

992
00:52:48,531 --> 00:52:49,555
What did you do?

993
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:51,829
I didn't do anything, I mean...

994
00:52:51,868 --> 00:52:55,827
I just had a frank conversation
with him about his future.

995
00:52:55,872 --> 00:52:58,500
Oh... Well, yeah.
That's a good idea.

996
00:52:58,541 --> 00:53:00,008
That's a good idea, Joe,

997
00:53:00,043 --> 00:53:02,273
because he will never
come back home now.

998
00:53:02,312 --> 00:53:05,907
He is my son. I only get
to see him every three years

999
00:53:05,949 --> 00:53:08,383
because of you. Because of you.

1000
00:53:08,418 --> 00:53:09,476
I've had enough.

1001
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:11,987
- You are gonna be supportive...
- Shh!

1002
00:53:12,021 --> 00:53:13,147
...of him marrying
Margaret, and that is that.

1003
00:53:13,189 --> 00:53:15,987
Shh! Shh! Shh!

1004
00:53:16,025 --> 00:53:17,583
You know, if we're not careful,

1005
00:53:17,627 --> 00:53:20,528
we are gonna end up in
this great big house...

1006
00:53:20,563 --> 00:53:22,690
...just you and me alone...

1007
00:53:22,732 --> 00:53:24,461
...you and me and everything
that we're angry about,

1008
00:53:24,501 --> 00:53:27,800
and God forbid that they
should have a grandchild

1009
00:53:27,837 --> 00:53:29,532
that we never get to see.

1010
00:53:29,572 --> 00:53:33,633
You are going to fix this,
Joe. I mean it. Fix it now.

1011
00:53:43,019 --> 00:53:46,216
Where's a towel?

1012
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:53,385
Towel...

1013
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:58,561
Towel, towel, towel... towel, towel.

1014
00:53:58,601 --> 00:54:00,432
This is all they have for a towel?

1015
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:02,961
It's ridiculous. I can't get dry.

1016
00:54:05,975 --> 00:54:07,033
Hello.

1017
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:09,837
Hello?

1018
00:54:15,718 --> 00:54:17,049
Oh!

1019
00:54:19,322 --> 00:54:20,846
Oh! Oh. Oh, oh, oh.

1020
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:21,914
No, no, no, no, no.

1021
00:54:21,958 --> 00:54:23,721
J-j-just... I'm sorry.

1022
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,921
L-l-let me just,
let me just get a towel.

1023
00:54:25,962 --> 00:54:27,395
Let me just get a towel.

1024
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:29,364
Just... look.

1025
00:54:29,399 --> 00:54:31,060
You need to just... I'm sorry.

1026
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:32,590
OK, I'm sorry for
feeding you to the eagle.

1027
00:54:32,635 --> 00:54:34,102
I'm sorry.

1028
00:54:38,741 --> 00:54:39,901
Go away. Go away.

1029
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:42,207
Go, go. Just let me get a towel.

1030
00:54:42,245 --> 00:54:45,305
Go, go, go... Hold on.

1031
00:54:51,654 --> 00:54:53,349
Yeah. Huh?

1032
00:54:53,389 --> 00:54:56,415
How you like that? Huh?

1033
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:58,393
Take it, take it. That's right.

1034
00:54:58,428 --> 00:55:01,056
That's what I'm talking
about. You like that?

1035
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:05,896
Oh. You like it.

1036
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:13,809
Come here. Come to Mama.

1037
00:55:13,843 --> 00:55:15,902
That's right. Get on the carpet.

1038
00:55:15,945 --> 00:55:17,936
That's a good boy.

1039
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:22,247
Yes! That's good, boy! Come on.

1040
00:55:22,285 --> 00:55:23,946
Come on!

1041
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:25,511
Oh, oh!

1042
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:32,584
- Oh, oh!
- What the?

1043
00:55:32,629 --> 00:55:35,154
- Oh!
- Oh, my God!

1044
00:55:35,198 --> 00:55:37,598
- Why are you naked? My God!
- Oh, God. Why are you wet?

1045
00:55:37,634 --> 00:55:40,228
- Don't look at me.
- I don't understand.

1046
00:55:40,269 --> 00:55:41,759
- Why are you wet?
- Why are you naked?

1047
00:55:41,804 --> 00:55:43,465
Don't look at me.

1048
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:46,100
Oh, God! You're showing everything.

1049
00:55:46,142 --> 00:55:48,133
Cover it up, for the love of God!

1050
00:55:48,177 --> 00:55:52,443
Oh, God, not the Baby Maker.

1051
00:55:52,482 --> 00:55:54,006
Explain yourself please.

1052
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:56,280
- Explain myself?
- Yes, explain yourself.

1053
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:57,479
- I was outside.
- Oh, really?

1054
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,784
- You didn't hear me?
- I was listening to...

1055
00:55:59,822 --> 00:56:01,016
What are you even doing home?

1056
00:56:01,057 --> 00:56:03,184
Then you just, jump me
out of nowhere? What's that?

1057
00:56:03,226 --> 00:56:04,955
I di... I didn't mean to jump you.

1058
00:56:04,994 --> 00:56:09,294
Your dog was attacking me, and I
had to run, and I ran into you.

1059
00:56:09,332 --> 00:56:10,959
What is it with you and this dog?

1060
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,991
Just, you know, just... go.

1061
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:14,333
- Go...
- Fine.

1062
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:15,962
- Go take a shower. You stink.
- Fine.

1063
00:56:16,005 --> 00:56:17,836
- Nice tattoo, by the way.
- What?

1064
00:56:19,976 --> 00:56:22,376
See? See? Exactly. You see that?

1065
00:56:22,412 --> 00:56:25,006
Oh... barely made it out
with my life there.

1066
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:26,982
See the size of the teeth on that thing?

1067
00:56:27,016 --> 00:56:28,415
I didn't...

1068
00:56:42,532 --> 00:56:48,129
So... So naked.

1069
00:56:49,672 --> 00:56:52,072
Can we, uh, not talk about that, please?

1070
00:56:53,242 --> 00:56:54,766
Just sayin'.

1071
00:56:59,649 --> 00:57:02,209
So, uh, what's the deal
with you and your father?

1072
00:57:02,251 --> 00:57:06,881
Ooh, I'm sorry. That question
is not in the binder.

1073
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:09,289
Oh, really? Well, I thought
you were the one that said

1074
00:57:09,325 --> 00:57:10,656
we needed to learn all this...

1075
00:57:10,693 --> 00:57:12,251
Not about that, I didn't.

1076
00:57:12,295 --> 00:57:14,195
- But if the guy asks us...
- Not about that, Margaret.

1077
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:16,061
Good night.

1078
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:35,483
- I like the Psychic Network.
- What?

1079
00:57:35,518 --> 00:57:38,282
Not in the "ha-ha, isn't that
funny, she likes that trash"

1080
00:57:38,321 --> 00:57:41,381
kind of way. I actually quite enjoy it.

1081
00:57:41,424 --> 00:57:42,982
Umm...

1082
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:49,064
I took disco lessons in the sixth grade.

1083
00:57:51,234 --> 00:57:55,261
My first concert was
Rob Base & D.J. E-Z Rock.

1084
00:57:57,507 --> 00:57:59,771
I think Brian Dennehy is sexy.

1085
00:58:01,210 --> 00:58:02,507
Don't like flowers in the house,

1086
00:58:02,545 --> 00:58:05,844
'cause they remind me of funerals.

1087
00:58:05,882 --> 00:58:07,406
Never played a video game.

1088
00:58:08,518 --> 00:58:11,453
I read <i>Wuthering Heights</i>
every Christmas.

1089
00:58:11,487 --> 00:58:13,853
It's my favorite book.

1090
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:21,119
Haven't slept with a man
in over a year and a half.

1091
00:58:23,099 --> 00:58:25,693
And, uh... I went to
the bathroom and cried

1092
00:58:25,735 --> 00:58:28,761
after Bob called me a poisonous bitch.

1093
00:58:30,373 --> 00:58:33,240
And the, uh, bird tattoo?

1094
00:58:33,276 --> 00:58:34,675
They're swallows.

1095
00:58:37,246 --> 00:58:41,307
Got them when I was 16...
after my parents died.

1096
00:58:43,753 --> 00:58:46,779
Stupid.

1097
00:58:46,823 --> 00:58:48,916
I'm sure there's many many other things,

1098
00:58:48,958 --> 00:58:51,426
but that's all I can
come up with right now.

1099
00:58:58,568 --> 00:59:00,035
You, uh, there?

1100
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,301
I'm here.

1101
00:59:06,976 --> 00:59:08,739
Just processing.

1102
00:59:15,451 --> 00:59:17,749
You really haven't slept
with anyone in 18 months?

1103
00:59:17,787 --> 00:59:20,278
Oh, my God. Out of all that,
that's all you got?

1104
00:59:20,323 --> 00:59:21,790
That's a long time.

1105
00:59:21,824 --> 00:59:24,122
Yeah, well, I've been a little busy.

1106
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,287
Yeah...

1107
00:59:28,831 --> 00:59:30,731
Who's, uh...

1108
00:59:30,766 --> 00:59:33,894
- Rob Base and D. J...
- E-Z Rock?

1109
00:59:33,936 --> 00:59:35,699
- Yeah.
- You know.

1110
00:59:42,545 --> 00:59:44,410
- No. They were good.
- Mm-mm.

1111
00:59:48,117 --> 00:59:52,247
- What?
- Nothing.

1112
00:59:52,288 --> 00:59:55,815
I know who they are. I just
wanted to hear you sing it.

1113
01:00:03,966 --> 01:00:06,833
- Margaret?
- Yes?

1114
01:00:08,704 --> 01:00:11,172
Don't take this the wrong way.

1115
01:00:12,808 --> 01:00:15,572
'K.

1116
01:00:15,611 --> 01:00:20,639
You are a very... very beautiful woman.

1117
01:00:46,175 --> 01:00:48,143
- Feel it deep, feel it low.
- Mmm-hmm.

1118
01:00:49,845 --> 01:00:52,541
God, I can't sing that high.

1119
01:01:16,205 --> 01:01:17,832
Huh? Where am I?

1120
01:01:19,709 --> 01:01:21,074
What time is it?

1121
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:22,668
What time is it?

1122
01:01:22,712 --> 01:01:26,341
Ooh! Ooh. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh...

1123
01:01:39,495 --> 01:01:40,621
Oh, God.

1124
01:02:02,852 --> 01:02:06,652
Room service.
Breakfast for the happy couple.

1125
01:02:06,689 --> 01:02:09,214
Andrew! Andrew!

1126
01:02:09,258 --> 01:02:12,193
Andr...

1127
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:13,695
Your mother's at the door. Get up!

1128
01:02:13,729 --> 01:02:15,094
- Get up here! Your mother's...
- Oh, God.

1129
01:02:15,131 --> 01:02:16,723
Just a second!

1130
01:02:21,103 --> 01:02:23,401
- Not the baby blanket.
- OK, all right.

1131
01:02:23,439 --> 01:02:26,169
Not the baby blanket. Get it
off, get it off, get it off.

1132
01:02:26,208 --> 01:02:28,142
- OK, all right.
- Wait a second. Hold on.

1133
01:02:28,177 --> 01:02:30,145
- What? What?
- Are you wearing makeup?

1134
01:02:30,179 --> 01:02:31,908
What? No. Of course not.

1135
01:02:31,947 --> 01:02:35,007
- OK, what do we do? All right.
- Just spoon me, spoon me...

1136
01:02:35,051 --> 01:02:37,815
- Oh, my God! What is that?
- I'm sorry. It's morning.

1137
01:02:37,853 --> 01:02:39,821
What do you mean, "It's morning"?

1138
01:02:39,855 --> 01:02:41,516
Are you OK?

1139
01:02:41,557 --> 01:02:44,390
Yep! Coming. One second. Yep.
Come on in. Everything's fine.

1140
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:46,918
Disgusting.

1141
01:02:46,962 --> 01:02:48,759
Ow, you're on my hair. OK, just...

1142
01:02:54,036 --> 01:02:57,335
- Oh, wow.
- Ooh, smells good.

1143
01:02:57,373 --> 01:02:58,772
Cinnamon rolls.

1144
01:02:58,808 --> 01:03:00,901
Oh, you shouldn't have
gone to that trouble.

1145
01:03:00,943 --> 01:03:03,912
Oh, you're family now. It's no trouble.

1146
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:06,346
Hey, you have room for one more?

1147
01:03:06,382 --> 01:03:10,512
Wow. Could we not do the
Brady family meeting right now?

1148
01:03:10,553 --> 01:03:11,577
We just got up...

1149
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:13,019
- Yeah.
...if you don't mind.

1150
01:03:13,055 --> 01:03:15,114
Your mother and I have
come up with a proposition

1151
01:03:15,157 --> 01:03:18,354
and I happen to think
it's a terrific idea...

1152
01:03:18,394 --> 01:03:20,658
We want you
to get married here tomorrow.

1153
01:03:20,696 --> 01:03:21,822
Tomorrow.

1154
01:03:23,732 --> 01:03:25,859
- What? What? What?
- Mmm-mmm. No.

1155
01:03:25,901 --> 01:03:27,562
Well, you're gonna get married anyway,

1156
01:03:27,603 --> 01:03:30,003
so why don't you get married here...

1157
01:03:30,039 --> 01:03:31,438
...where we can be all together,

1158
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:34,773
and that way Grandma Annie
can be a part of it.

1159
01:03:34,810 --> 01:03:36,971
- Oh. Oh, we're...
- No.

1160
01:03:37,012 --> 01:03:40,345
No. No, it's Gammy's
big birthday tomorrow night.

1161
01:03:40,382 --> 01:03:41,474
Big day for her.

1162
01:03:41,517 --> 01:03:43,610
We don't want to ruin it.
That's you know...

1163
01:03:43,652 --> 01:03:47,383
I've had 89 birthday parties,
I don't need another one.

1164
01:03:47,423 --> 01:03:48,822
Oh, Gammy.

1165
01:03:48,858 --> 01:03:51,326
It would be a dream come true for me

1166
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:53,726
to see my one grandchild's wedding.

1167
01:03:53,762 --> 01:03:56,026
- A dream come true!
- Mmmm.

1168
01:03:56,065 --> 01:03:59,262
- So you'll do it?
- Mmm-mmm.

1169
01:03:59,301 --> 01:04:00,962
Before I'm dead?

1170
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:02,402
- OK. OK.
- OK.

1171
01:04:04,707 --> 01:04:06,971
OK, we will do everything.

1172
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:09,569
And you can get married
like we did, in the barn.

1173
01:04:09,612 --> 01:04:11,739
It's a Paxton family tradition.

1174
01:04:11,780 --> 01:04:14,476
- Oh, wow!
- Yup.

1175
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:19,819
Wow! Uh! I've always wanted to
get married in a... in a barn.

1176
01:04:19,855 --> 01:04:22,187
- I have.
- It's a sign.

1177
01:04:22,224 --> 01:04:25,990
A sign from the universe that
you're meant to be together.

1178
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:29,191
Oh, we must give thanks, I tell you.

1179
01:04:29,231 --> 01:04:32,359
Come, come. We must give thanks.

1180
01:04:32,401 --> 01:04:35,029
OK, I know I should leave you alone now.

1181
01:04:35,070 --> 01:04:38,528
But we're just so excited!
I know you're excited, too.

1182
01:04:38,574 --> 01:04:40,474
- It's the craziest.
- Really excited.

1183
01:04:40,509 --> 01:04:43,910
Yeah! Go. Go.

1184
01:04:43,946 --> 01:04:45,038
Go.

1185
01:04:49,485 --> 01:04:52,818
Oh, my God.

1186
01:04:52,855 --> 01:04:54,755
When my mom finds out that
this whole thing is a sham

1187
01:04:54,790 --> 01:04:56,121
she's gonna... she's gonna be crushed,

1188
01:04:56,158 --> 01:04:58,353
and my grandmother's gonna die.

1189
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:00,021
- Your mom's not going to find out.
- I... my father.

1190
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:01,620
What the hell's with that?
The whole wedding thing?

1191
01:05:01,664 --> 01:05:02,688
Where did that come from?

1192
01:05:02,731 --> 01:05:04,961
She probably got him worked up into it.

1193
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,228
It's fine. She's not gonna find out.

1194
01:05:06,268 --> 01:05:08,395
- They're not going to find out.
- Oh, God. Margaret!

1195
01:05:08,437 --> 01:05:11,895
Andrew, they're not gonna
find out, OK? Just relax.

1196
01:05:11,941 --> 01:05:13,499
It's gonna be OK.

1197
01:05:13,542 --> 01:05:16,033
It's not like we're
gonna be married forever.

1198
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:18,672
We'll be happily divorced
before you know it.

1199
01:05:18,714 --> 01:05:23,117
It will be fine. It will be fine.

1200
01:05:23,152 --> 01:05:24,710
You OK?

1201
01:05:24,753 --> 01:05:26,380
Yeah.

1202
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:33,452
- Get us some coffee.
- Yeah.

1203
01:05:33,495 --> 01:05:37,192
So, would you like a cinnamon soy latte?

1204
01:05:37,233 --> 01:05:38,962
A-ha.

1205
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:45,164
You're right, you know...

1206
01:05:45,207 --> 01:05:46,504
Get a quickie divorce, we'll be fine.

1207
01:05:46,542 --> 01:05:48,169
- Absolutely.
- It's gonna be fine.

1208
01:05:48,210 --> 01:05:50,576
Everything is going to be great.

1209
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:52,513
But this little missus
better learn how to cook...

1210
01:05:52,548 --> 01:05:54,379
...so she can take care of her husband.

1211
01:05:54,416 --> 01:05:55,542
Keep my man happy.

1212
01:05:55,584 --> 01:05:57,313
I don't want him leaving
me for another woman.

1213
01:05:57,353 --> 01:05:58,445
Come on...

1214
01:05:58,487 --> 01:06:01,251
...haven't left you yet, Margaret.

1215
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:04,157
I got it. Let go.

1216
01:06:06,061 --> 01:06:08,495
- You all right?
- Yeah, um...

1217
01:06:08,530 --> 01:06:10,020
You know what? I'm gonna go.

1218
01:06:10,065 --> 01:06:11,362
Where?

1219
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:14,301
I just kinda feel like going outside.

1220
01:06:14,336 --> 01:06:16,861
All right. That's the bathroom.

1221
01:06:16,905 --> 01:06:18,304
Oh, yeah. I know. I'm just, uh...

1222
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:21,537
I'm gonna go to go to the bathroom,
and then I'm gonna go out, outside.

1223
01:06:21,577 --> 01:06:22,601
All right.

1224
01:06:23,712 --> 01:06:25,179
All right.

1225
01:06:36,158 --> 01:06:41,027
OK, you just have to focus,
Margaret. Just focus.

1226
01:06:41,063 --> 01:06:43,827
This is a business deal.
This is just a business deal.

1227
01:06:43,866 --> 01:06:48,633
Everything's
gonna be just fine.

1228
01:06:49,938 --> 01:06:53,840
OK, this is a little
rough. I can do this.

1229
01:06:55,311 --> 01:06:57,779
Oh, my God. God, I hate nature!

1230
01:06:57,813 --> 01:06:59,144
I hate it.

1231
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:02,582
Not stopping. Not stopping. Oh! Oh...

1232
01:07:02,618 --> 01:07:04,586
Why are you not stopping?

1233
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:07,054
Stop, stop, stop it, stop!

1234
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:13,787
I just wanted... some air.

1235
01:07:18,133 --> 01:07:20,624
What is that?

1236
01:07:20,669 --> 01:07:25,333
What now? What is that? What is that?

1237
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:27,808
What is that?

1238
01:07:40,522 --> 01:07:42,683
What is that?

1239
01:07:59,041 --> 01:08:02,238
Come to me,
Margaret of New York.

1240
01:08:02,277 --> 01:08:04,745
It is I, Grandma Annie.

1241
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:06,145
Oh!

1242
01:08:06,181 --> 01:08:08,672
I see you are a curious one.

1243
01:08:08,717 --> 01:08:11,709
Come. See how I give
thanks to Mother Earth.

1244
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:14,154
You know, actually,
I'm not that curious.

1245
01:08:14,189 --> 01:08:16,054
- I'll just...
- Look around you.

1246
01:08:16,091 --> 01:08:18,616
Mother Earth has provided all this...

1247
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:23,097
...just as she brought you and
Andrew together to be joined.

1248
01:08:23,132 --> 01:08:25,760
- Oh.
- We must give thanks

1249
01:08:25,801 --> 01:08:28,998
and ask that your loins
be abundantly fertile.

1250
01:08:29,037 --> 01:08:32,495
Come. Dance with me in celebration.

1251
01:08:32,541 --> 01:08:35,874
You know, can I, can I
just thank her from here?

1252
01:08:35,911 --> 01:08:37,776
I insist!

1253
01:08:37,813 --> 01:08:40,111
OK, OK, OK.

1254
01:08:40,149 --> 01:08:42,913
I will come down and dance with you.

1255
01:08:44,753 --> 01:08:47,916
Follow and learn.

1256
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:55,890
Come on, Margaret! Feel the
rhythm of the drums. Now you.

1257
01:08:55,931 --> 01:08:57,455
- Me what?
- Chant.

1258
01:08:57,499 --> 01:08:59,057
Chant what?

1259
01:08:59,101 --> 01:09:01,228
Whatever comes
to you. It is the way.

1260
01:09:01,270 --> 01:09:05,036
- But I don't know any chants.
- To the trees. Use your vowels.

1261
01:09:05,073 --> 01:09:08,839
- Eee. Ooo. Ooo. Eee.
- Ooo. Eee.

1262
01:09:08,877 --> 01:09:10,640
- Yes. Chant.
- Yes. Chant, chant.

1263
01:09:10,679 --> 01:09:12,806
- Eee. To the trees.
- Yes! Yes!

1264
01:09:12,848 --> 01:09:16,875
- To the universe!
- The universe. Ah. Universe.

1265
01:09:16,919 --> 01:09:20,685
To the crazy.
To the window, the window.

1266
01:09:20,722 --> 01:09:22,383
To the wall, to the wall.

1267
01:09:22,424 --> 01:09:24,119
To the sweat drip down my balls.

1268
01:09:24,159 --> 01:09:26,593
- To all you bitches...
- Louder!

1269
01:09:26,628 --> 01:09:28,562
To the window, to the window.

1270
01:09:28,597 --> 01:09:30,326
To the walls, to the walls.

1271
01:09:30,365 --> 01:09:31,957
To the sweat drip down my balls.

1272
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,264
Now all you bitches crawl.

1273
01:09:34,303 --> 01:09:35,964
<i># All skeet, skeet, mother</i>

1274

01:09:59,161 --> 01:10:01,994
Gammy! Let's take it
to the bridge! Woo!

1286
01:10:02,030 --> 01:10:04,191
<i># Let me see you get low</i>

<i># You scared, you scared</i>
<i>See you get low</i>

1295
01:10:18,213 --> 01:10:20,374
- Whatcha doing?
- <i># Just wiggle it</i>

1296
01:10:21,083 --> 01:10:22,550
Oh, uh.

1297
01:10:22,584 --> 01:10:26,884
Uh... You know,
your Gammy wanted me to...

1298
01:10:26,922 --> 01:10:28,822
...you know, chant.
Chant from the heart.

1299
01:10:28,857 --> 01:10:31,348
Balls? That's what came to your heart?

1300
01:10:31,393 --> 01:10:35,124
You know, it went with the beat.

1301
01:10:35,163 --> 01:10:36,926
Your phone arrived.

1302
01:10:36,965 --> 01:10:38,523
I'm gonna go into town
to pick it up. Wanna come?

1303
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:41,468
Oh, yes, I want to go.
I want to go. Oh, hold on.

1304
01:10:41,503 --> 01:10:44,404
Is it, uh, OK if I go with him?

1305
01:10:44,439 --> 01:10:47,067
Whatever you do is what shall be.

1306
01:10:48,076 --> 01:10:49,236
But you're OK if I go?

1307
01:10:49,278 --> 01:10:52,736
- Fine. Go on.
- Bye, Gammy.

1308
01:10:52,781 --> 01:10:55,272
- You're a freak!
- Shut up.

1309
01:10:55,317 --> 01:10:57,785
Would you, please?

1310
01:10:58,353 --> 01:10:59,377
Ow!

1311
01:11:17,573 --> 01:11:18,665
Hey, buddy.

1312
01:11:18,707 --> 01:11:20,436
Andrew, hey!

1313
01:11:20,475 --> 01:11:23,444
- You got that phone I ordered?
- Yes, it came in. How are you?

1314
01:11:23,478 --> 01:11:25,378
- Great. You?
- Good.

1315
01:11:27,282 --> 01:11:28,772
<i>Hola.</i>

1316
01:11:29,651 --> 01:11:32,211
Hey, hi.

1317
01:11:32,254 --> 01:11:33,881
Remember this?

1318
01:11:33,922 --> 01:11:35,014
Yes, yes.

1319
01:11:35,057 --> 01:11:37,617
Wonderful. Wonderful. Yes.

1320
01:11:37,659 --> 01:11:40,628
- Remember that?
- Yes. Yes. I know.

1321
01:11:43,799 --> 01:11:45,824
Think you made quite
an impression on Ramone.

1322
01:11:45,867 --> 01:11:48,233
Mmm-hmm, I think the part
where I burst into tears

1323
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:49,897
just really brought us together.

1324
01:11:49,938 --> 01:11:51,405
- Yeah. Oh, guess what.
- What?

1325
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:52,873
Fun fact about Andrew number 11:

1326
01:11:52,908 --> 01:11:54,432
- I like Pringles.
- Mm-hmm. OK.

1327
01:11:54,476 --> 01:11:55,841
They're delicious. All Hostess products.

1328
01:11:55,877 --> 01:11:57,538
Coke, never Pepsi, and beef jerky.

1329
01:11:57,579 --> 01:11:58,841
What, are you, like, 13?

1330
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:00,472
- Mmm.
- Here we go.

1331
01:12:00,515 --> 01:12:01,743
It's all charged up, Andrew.

1332
01:12:01,783 --> 01:12:02,807
Thanks, buddy.

1333
01:12:04,653 --> 01:12:06,985
And I put your lady's number in, too.

1334
01:12:07,022 --> 01:12:08,512
- Thank you very mu...
- Milady.

1335
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:13,851
Thank you, thank you very much.
Thank you.

1336
01:12:13,895 --> 01:12:15,260
Just... thank you.

1337
01:12:19,501 --> 01:12:22,095
Oh, my God. I have 37 messages.

1338
01:12:23,105 --> 01:12:24,470
Shit. I need a computer.

1339
01:12:24,506 --> 01:12:26,337
Is there, is there a computer
in this godforsaken town?

1340
01:12:29,945 --> 01:12:33,176
OK. So when it runs out,
it gives you a warning.

1341
01:12:33,215 --> 01:12:34,546
Just put in more dimes.

1342
01:12:35,951 --> 01:12:37,782
- Here you go.
- What?

1343
01:12:37,819 --> 01:12:39,753
- You're kidding. Dimes?
- Come on, Kels.

1344
01:12:39,788 --> 01:12:41,255
- You're not kidding?
- I'll be outside.

1345
01:12:41,289 --> 01:12:42,620
- Yell if you need me.
- But what am I supposed...

1346
01:12:42,658 --> 01:12:44,319
You'll be fine.

1347
01:12:46,428 --> 01:12:50,455
OK, I can figure this out.
I'm an intelligent woman.

1348
01:12:50,499 --> 01:12:52,933
Block 'em out, block 'em out,
block 'em out. There you go.

1349
01:12:52,968 --> 01:12:54,663
OK.

1350
01:12:54,703 --> 01:12:56,933
Now.

1351
01:12:56,972 --> 01:12:58,462
What is that? What is it?

1352
01:13:02,144 --> 01:13:05,170
Um, uh, excuse me? Excuse...

1353
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:10,010
OK.

1354
01:13:12,854 --> 01:13:14,879
OK.

1355
01:13:42,651 --> 01:13:45,313
So, it was nice
to see Gertrude, huh?

1356
01:13:45,353 --> 01:13:46,820
Yeah.

1357
01:13:46,855 --> 01:13:49,050
She looked really pretty today.

1358
01:13:50,459 --> 01:13:52,324
- Yeah, she did.
- Mmm-hmm.

1359
01:13:53,595 --> 01:13:56,587
Must be nice to see each other
again and just catch up.

1360
01:13:56,631 --> 01:13:58,758
It's definitely good to see her. It's...

1361
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,631
...definitely, yeah.
It's been a long time.

1362
01:14:02,437 --> 01:14:04,905
Oh, there they are.
There they are. Margaret!

1363
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:06,271
Woo!

1364
01:14:06,308 --> 01:14:07,400
We need Margaret.

1365
01:14:07,442 --> 01:14:10,002
Afraid we're going to have to
steal you away, young lady.

1366
01:14:10,045 --> 01:14:11,569
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I'm just gonna keep...

1367
01:14:11,613 --> 01:14:13,308
No, not to worry.

1368
01:14:13,348 --> 01:14:15,680
No strippers, no chanting
in the woods. Promise.

1369
01:14:15,717 --> 01:14:17,582
- Oh, well...
- Yeah. Come on.

1370
01:14:17,619 --> 01:14:21,453
But not you. It's girl stuff.
You'd hate it.

1371
01:14:21,490 --> 01:14:24,050
- But...
- Come on.

1372
01:14:24,092 --> 01:14:25,684
Um, OK. Will I, uh...

1373
01:14:25,727 --> 01:14:27,957
...are these shoes OK
for what we're gonna do?

1374
01:14:29,331 --> 01:14:31,265
I can't believe this is happening.

1375
01:14:32,334 --> 01:14:34,894
My mother made this dress by hand.

1376
01:14:34,936 --> 01:14:38,702
In this very shop. In 1929.

1377
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:41,732
It's funny how things
come back in style.

1378
01:14:41,777 --> 01:14:43,768
Just... just
finishing up the buttons.

1379
01:14:43,812 --> 01:14:45,541
Yeah, and don't worry about the fit

1380
01:14:45,580 --> 01:14:48,606
because Annie is the best
tailor in southeast Alaska.

1381
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:49,674
Oh... Pssh.

1382
01:14:52,087 --> 01:14:53,611
Wow, incredible.

1383
01:14:53,655 --> 01:14:56,215
Maybe a tad loose in certain
areas, but otherwise...

1384
01:14:56,258 --> 01:14:59,989
Oh, sorry. I'm a bit
chesty to begin with

1385
01:15:00,028 --> 01:15:02,724
and I happened to be
knocked up when I wore this.

1386
01:15:02,764 --> 01:15:04,095
Oh.

1387
01:15:04,132 --> 01:15:07,431
Oh, let's see if we can find your boobs.

1388
01:15:09,504 --> 01:15:12,598
- They're in there somewhere.
- Yes. Yes, they are.

1389
01:15:12,641 --> 01:15:14,472
This is like an Easter egg hunt.

1390
01:15:15,644 --> 01:15:18,135
Maybe they shrunk up
in the cold Alaskan air.

1391
01:15:21,116 --> 01:15:25,018
- Oh! There they are.
- That... yes. That would be...

1392
01:15:25,053 --> 01:15:28,580
- There, let's see.
- I was thinking, if you'd like,

1393
01:15:28,623 --> 01:15:33,356
maybe we could head down your
way for the holidays this year.

1394
01:15:33,395 --> 01:15:35,590
Oh, that would, uh...
that would be nice.

1395
01:15:35,630 --> 01:15:40,124
That'd be nice. Or maybe
we could come to you, too.

1396
01:15:40,168 --> 01:15:43,899
- Well, that would be lovely.
- Mmm-hmm.

1397
01:15:43,939 --> 01:15:46,100
I would like that very much.

1398
01:15:46,141 --> 01:15:48,939
Oh, Grace, for God's sake.
We've got work to do.

1399
01:15:48,977 --> 01:15:51,775
- I know. I'm sorry.
- Go make yourself a cup of tea.

1400
01:15:51,813 --> 01:15:54,646
I'll finish this. Go.

1401
01:15:54,683 --> 01:16:00,622
Now, let's make this
absolute perfection.

1402
01:16:02,824 --> 01:16:08,319
Now, just one special touch
and you're ready.

1403
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:16,868
It's been in the family
for more than 150 years.

1404
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:18,873
Annie, it's beautiful,
but I don't really think...

1405
01:16:18,907 --> 01:16:21,569
- Shh. I'm not finished.
- Oh, sorry.

1406
01:16:21,610 --> 01:16:25,102
My great-grandfather gave it
to my great-grandmother

1407
01:16:25,146 --> 01:16:27,307
when they got married.

1408
01:16:27,349 --> 01:16:29,408
They were quite a scandal, you know.

1409
01:16:29,451 --> 01:16:33,410
He was Russian and she
was Tlingit, and back then

1410
01:16:33,455 --> 01:16:36,253
you had to get approval
from every member of the tribe

1411
01:16:36,291 --> 01:16:37,622
before you got married.

1412
01:16:37,659 --> 01:16:39,217
Almost broke them up.

1413
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:42,196
Well... how did they stay together then?

1414
01:16:42,230 --> 01:16:44,926
She was a lot like you. Tough.

1415
01:16:44,966 --> 01:16:47,901
Wouldn't take "no" for an answer.

1416
01:16:47,936 --> 01:16:51,804
She was good for him.

1417
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:53,603
I want you to have it.

1418
01:16:53,642 --> 01:16:57,134
- I can't. Can't take this.
- I don't want to hear it.

1419
01:16:57,178 --> 01:17:00,807
Grandmothers love to give
their stuff to their grandchildren.

1420
01:17:00,849 --> 01:17:03,579
It makes us feel like we'll
still be part of your lives

1421
01:17:03,618 --> 01:17:05,017
even after we're gone.

1422
01:17:05,053 --> 01:17:07,248
Take it.

1423
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:15,927
Are... are you all right, dear?

1424
01:17:17,265 --> 01:17:19,927
I, uh...

1425
01:17:21,469 --> 01:17:24,404
Uh... Well, I, um...

1426
01:17:26,574 --> 01:17:32,308
I, uh... I just, uh, I just wanted to...

1427
01:17:32,347 --> 01:17:35,111
make sure there was enough time
to get all the sewing done.

1428
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:38,119
Don't you worry about that.

1429
01:17:38,153 --> 01:17:40,621
- You're gonna be beautiful.
- OK.

1430
01:17:40,655 --> 01:17:44,250
- Now let's get you out of those pins.
- OK.

1431
01:18:07,382 --> 01:18:08,508
All right.

1432
01:18:13,588 --> 01:18:18,025
This is untied. Hop on in.

1433
01:18:20,395 --> 01:18:22,795
Hey, hey, hey. Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1434
01:18:23,498 --> 01:18:24,897
Whoa! What...

1435
01:18:24,933 --> 01:18:26,491
Mind telling me what the hell's wrong?

1436
01:18:26,534 --> 01:18:28,229
I just needed to get
away from everybody.

1437
01:18:28,269 --> 01:18:30,294
- What's wrong?
- Nothing! Just stop talking, please!

1438
01:18:38,747 --> 01:18:42,308
Would you mind telling me
what's happening now?

1439
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:43,817
Margaret.

1440
01:18:46,454 --> 01:18:48,979
- Margaret!
- I forgot, OK?

1441
01:18:49,024 --> 01:18:50,218
You forgot what?

1442
01:18:50,258 --> 01:18:52,818
I forgot what it was
like to have a family!

1443
01:18:52,861 --> 01:18:55,227
I've been on my own since I was 16

1444
01:18:55,263 --> 01:18:58,198
and I forgot what it felt
like to have people love you

1445
01:18:58,233 --> 01:19:00,497
and make you breakfast and say, "Hey!

1446
01:19:00,535 --> 01:19:02,127
We'd love to come down
for the holidays."

1447
01:19:02,170 --> 01:19:05,662
And I say, "Well, why don't we
come up and see you instead?"

1448
01:19:05,707 --> 01:19:08,198
And give you necklaces!
And you have all that here,

1449
01:19:08,243 --> 01:19:10,905
and you have Gertrude, and
I'm... I'm just screwing it up!

1450
01:19:10,945 --> 01:19:13,175
You're not screwing it up!
I agreed to this!

1451
01:19:13,214 --> 01:19:14,272
You were there, remember?

1452
01:19:14,315 --> 01:19:15,873
Your family loves you. Do you know that?

1453
01:19:15,917 --> 01:19:17,475
- I know that! Yes!
- You know that?

1454
01:19:17,519 --> 01:19:19,180
And you're still willing
to put them through this?

1455
01:19:19,220 --> 01:19:20,244
They're not gonna find out!

1456
01:19:20,288 --> 01:19:21,585
How do you know they won't find out?

1457
01:19:21,623 --> 01:19:22,954
Because you said so yourself.

1458
01:19:22,991 --> 01:19:24,959
- I know, but what if your mother...
- You said so yourself!

1459
01:19:24,993 --> 01:19:26,187
Oh, my God, if your mother found out...

1460
01:19:26,227 --> 01:19:28,252
Whoa! Whoa!

1461
01:19:28,296 --> 01:19:29,923
- Oh, my God! What if Gammy finds out?
- The boat is moving!

1462
01:19:29,964 --> 01:19:31,397
If Gammy finds out, she's
gonna have a heart attack!

1463
01:19:31,433 --> 01:19:33,367
Stop! It's gonna be fine!

1464
01:19:33,401 --> 01:19:35,631
- She's gonna have a heart attack!
- Will you calm down! Hold on!

1465
01:19:36,571 --> 01:19:38,095
Whoa, whoa. Whoa!

1466
01:19:38,139 --> 01:19:41,768
Whoa! I don't think
that hijacking a boat

1467
01:19:41,810 --> 01:19:45,405
is a proper way to
express your frustration!

1468
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:46,812
Now... Oh, great.

1469
01:19:46,848 --> 01:19:49,180
Now you decide to shut up! Margaret?

1470
01:19:49,217 --> 01:19:51,276
- Andrew!
- Margaret?

1471
01:19:51,319 --> 01:19:53,981
- Andrew!
- Margaret!

1472
01:19:57,792 --> 01:19:58,850
I can't swim!

1473
01:19:58,893 --> 01:20:00,417
Margaret!

1474
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:01,724
To the buoy!

1475
01:20:01,763 --> 01:20:04,231
- What?
- To the buoy!

1476
01:20:05,133 --> 01:20:06,157
OK.

1477
01:20:19,447 --> 01:20:21,813
All right, come on! Give me your hand!

1478
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:24,318
Hey! Give me your hand!

1479
01:20:24,352 --> 01:20:27,048
Margaret! Give me...

1480
01:20:27,088 --> 01:20:28,612
Come on, give me your hand!

1481
01:20:28,656 --> 01:20:30,146
Come on, come on. I got you. I got you.

1482
01:20:31,192 --> 01:20:32,682
I got you.

1483
01:20:33,928 --> 01:20:36,328
Come on.

1484
01:20:36,364 --> 01:20:38,195
What the hell
were you thinking?

1485
01:20:38,233 --> 01:20:39,894
Could've gotten yourself killed.

1486
01:20:39,934 --> 01:20:43,335
You turned the boat and
made me fall in, you jackass.

1487
01:20:43,371 --> 01:20:45,396
You let go of the steering wheel, Ahab.

1488
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:48,068
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1489
01:20:48,109 --> 01:20:51,408
All right, come here.
You've got to get warm. Come on.

1490
01:20:51,446 --> 01:20:56,008
Come on. It's OK.

1491
01:20:56,050 --> 01:20:57,210
That's OK.

1492
01:21:00,622 --> 01:21:01,850
It's OK.

1493
01:21:33,922 --> 01:21:35,412
I want to talk to both of you.

1494
01:21:48,503 --> 01:21:51,131
Your mother is never to
hear about any of this.

1495
01:22:03,451 --> 01:22:05,442
Told you I'd check up on you.

1496
01:22:06,955 --> 01:22:08,183
What did you do?

1497
01:22:08,223 --> 01:22:10,123
I got a phone call from
Mr. Gilbertson here,

1498
01:22:10,158 --> 01:22:12,422
who told me that if you were lying,

1499
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:14,690
and he strongly believes that you are,

1500
01:22:14,729 --> 01:22:16,253
he would send you to prison.

1501
01:22:16,297 --> 01:22:18,390
So I flew him up here.

1502
01:22:18,433 --> 01:22:20,458
- Dad.
- Luckily for you,

1503
01:22:20,501 --> 01:22:23,527
your father negotiated
a deal on your behalf.

1504
01:22:23,571 --> 01:22:26,802
Now, this offer's
gonna last for 20 seconds,

1505
01:22:26,841 --> 01:22:28,570
so listen closely.

1506
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:29,702
You're gonna make a statement

1507
01:22:29,744 --> 01:22:31,405
admitting this marriage is a sham...

1508
01:22:31,446 --> 01:22:32,743
...or you're gonna go to prison.

1509
01:22:32,780 --> 01:22:35,010
You tell the truth, you're off the hook,

1510
01:22:35,049 --> 01:22:37,813
and she is going to go back to Canada.

1511
01:22:43,224 --> 01:22:46,022
Ah, well. Take the deal.

1512
01:22:46,060 --> 01:22:50,463
- I don't think so.
- Don't be stupid, Andrew.

1513
01:22:50,498 --> 01:22:52,295
You want a statement?
Here's your statement.

1514
01:22:52,333 --> 01:22:53,994
I've been working for
Margaret Tate for three years.

1515
01:22:54,035 --> 01:22:56,333
Six months ago we started
dating, we fell in love.

1516
01:22:56,371 --> 01:22:58,236
I asked her to marry me, she said "yes."

1517
01:22:58,273 --> 01:23:00,468
I'll see you at the wedding.

1518
01:23:11,152 --> 01:23:12,744
Well, you know.

1519
01:23:34,075 --> 01:23:38,034
So...

1520
01:23:38,079 --> 01:23:40,741
...you sure about this?

1521
01:23:40,782 --> 01:23:42,340
Not really.

1522
01:23:46,054 --> 01:23:48,887
I mean, I am very appreciative
of what you've done,

1523
01:23:48,923 --> 01:23:49,947
but I think that...

1524
01:23:49,991 --> 01:23:51,185
You'd do the same for me.

1525
01:23:51,225 --> 01:23:52,852
Right?

1526
01:23:54,262 --> 01:23:56,594
Hope everyone is decent.

1527
01:23:56,631 --> 01:23:58,121
You need to come with me.

1528
01:23:58,166 --> 01:23:59,861
Now, tomorrow
is your wedding day.

1529
01:23:59,901 --> 01:24:01,562
You have to give the
Baby Maker a rest tonight.

1530
01:24:01,602 --> 01:24:03,365
It's tradition.

1531
01:24:03,404 --> 01:24:05,395
- Give your bride a kiss good night.
- We're not gonna...

1532
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:06,668
...use the Baby Maker.

1533
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:08,437
You've got your whole
lives to be together.

1534
01:24:08,476 --> 01:24:11,274
- OK.
- Now, come on. Come on.

1535
01:24:18,586 --> 01:24:19,780
If I don't go with her,
she's just gonna...

1536
01:24:19,821 --> 01:24:23,723
- Come right back.
- Yeah.

1537
01:24:30,698 --> 01:24:32,063
See you in the morning?

1538
01:24:33,134 --> 01:24:34,533
Yeah.

1539
01:25:37,565 --> 01:25:38,657
Hey, Gammy.

1540
01:25:40,468 --> 01:25:42,231
- Thanks, Gammy.
- Oh.

1541
01:26:51,906 --> 01:26:53,396
Everyone, please be seated.

1542
01:26:59,380 --> 01:27:00,404
Ramone.

1543
01:27:04,352 --> 01:27:09,085
We are gathered here
today to give thanks...

1544
01:27:10,057 --> 01:27:12,685
...and to celebrate...

1545
01:27:12,727 --> 01:27:15,287
...one of life's greatest moments.

1546
01:27:15,329 --> 01:27:17,160
To give recognition

1547
01:27:17,198 --> 01:27:21,965
to the beauty, honesty,
and unselfish ways

1548
01:27:22,003 --> 01:27:24,801
of Andrew and Margaret's true love

1549
01:27:24,839 --> 01:27:27,307
in front of family and friends.

1550
01:27:27,341 --> 01:27:30,242
For it is their family and friends

1551
01:27:30,278 --> 01:27:34,578
who taught Andrew and Margaret to love.

1552
01:27:34,615 --> 01:27:39,382
So it is only right that
family and friends are all...

1553
01:27:42,890 --> 01:27:45,120
<i>Mi amor.</i> Do you have a question?

1554
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:47,928
Uh, no...

1555
01:27:47,962 --> 01:27:49,452
Your hand is up.

1556
01:27:53,034 --> 01:27:56,060
Oh, it, it's, uh, not a question,

1557
01:27:56,103 --> 01:27:58,367
but I do have something I need to say.

1558
01:27:58,406 --> 01:28:02,342
- Margaret.
- Can it wait till after?

1559
01:28:02,376 --> 01:28:06,904
Uh... No. No.

1560
01:28:18,292 --> 01:28:22,194
- Hi there.
- Hi.

1561
01:28:22,229 --> 01:28:24,390
Thank you all so much for coming out.

1562
01:28:24,432 --> 01:28:27,595
I, uh... have
a bit of an announcement

1563
01:28:27,635 --> 01:28:29,762
to make about the wedding.

1564
01:28:29,804 --> 01:28:33,103
- A confession, actually.
- What are you doing?

1565
01:28:33,140 --> 01:28:36,701
Uh... I'm a Canadian. Yes, Canadian.

1566
01:28:36,744 --> 01:28:40,908
With an expired visa
who was about to be deported.

1567
01:28:40,948 --> 01:28:42,609
And because I didn't want to leave

1568
01:28:42,650 --> 01:28:44,880
this wonderful country of yours,

1569
01:28:44,919 --> 01:28:47,854
I forced Andrew here to marry me.

1570
01:28:47,888 --> 01:28:49,321
Margaret, stop it.

1571
01:28:49,357 --> 01:28:53,225
See, Andrew has always had
this extraordinary work ethic.

1572
01:28:54,695 --> 01:28:56,356
Something I think he learned from you.

1573
01:28:57,665 --> 01:28:59,724
And for three years I
watched him work harder

1574
01:28:59,767 --> 01:29:01,735
than anyone else at our company.

1575
01:29:01,769 --> 01:29:05,034
And I knew that if I threatened
to destroy his career...

1576
01:29:05,072 --> 01:29:08,269
...he would, he would do
just about anything.

1577
01:29:11,846 --> 01:29:15,873
So I blackmailed him to
come up here and to lie to you.

1578
01:29:18,019 --> 01:29:21,045
All of you.

1579
01:29:21,088 --> 01:29:23,818
And I thought it would
be easy to watch him do it.

1580
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:27,518
But it wasn't.

1581
01:29:30,398 --> 01:29:32,559
Turns out it's not easy
to ruin someone's life

1582
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:35,228
once you find out
how wonderful they are.

1583
01:29:41,475 --> 01:29:43,500
You have a beautiful family.

1584
01:29:45,346 --> 01:29:47,473
Don't let this
come between you.

1585
01:29:50,518 --> 01:29:52,816
This was my fault.

1586
01:29:52,853 --> 01:29:54,684
Margaret...

1587
01:29:54,722 --> 01:29:56,622
Andrew, this was a business deal,

1588
01:29:56,657 --> 01:30:00,684
and you held up your end,
but now the deal is off.

1589
01:30:01,962 --> 01:30:03,259
I'm sorry.

1590
01:30:05,166 --> 01:30:06,394
And, you, meet me at the dock.

1591
01:30:06,434 --> 01:30:08,231
You're giving me a ride to the airport.

1592
01:30:25,052 --> 01:30:27,543
- What were you thinking?
- I don't, I don't know.

1593
01:30:27,588 --> 01:30:29,180
Andrew, you lied to us.

1594
01:30:29,223 --> 01:30:30,622
Let me get my head on straight, OK?

1595
01:30:30,658 --> 01:30:32,057
I'll explain everything later.

1596
01:30:32,093 --> 01:30:34,425
I'm sorry.

1597
01:31:11,832 --> 01:31:14,699
<i> You were right.</i>
<i>This book is special.</i>

1598
01:31:14,735 --> 01:31:16,362
<i>I lied because I knew publishing meant</i>

1599
01:31:16,403 --> 01:31:17,665
<i>I'd lose you as an assistant</i>

1600
01:31:17,705 --> 01:31:19,935
<i>but... you have an extraordinary eye,</i>

1601
01:31:19,974 --> 01:31:23,000
<i>and I'll make sure we</i>
<i>buy this before I leave.</i>

1602
01:31:23,043 --> 01:31:27,173
<i>Have an amazing life.</i>
<i>You deserve it. Margaret.</i>

1603
01:31:29,416 --> 01:31:32,647
Well, that was, uh... crazy.

1604
01:31:34,054 --> 01:31:36,488
You know, people are gonna be
talking about this forever.

1605
01:31:38,392 --> 01:31:40,019
Yeah. Yeah.

1606
01:31:41,729 --> 01:31:42,855
Are you OK?

1607
01:31:44,098 --> 01:31:46,965
Yeah. No. Uh...

1608
01:31:49,136 --> 01:31:53,004
I just feel... You know
what the problem is?

1609
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:56,237
The problem is that this woman...

1610
01:31:56,277 --> 01:31:59,804
...is a gigantic pain in my ass.

1611
01:31:59,847 --> 01:32:02,315
First there's the whole leaving
thing. I understand that.

1612
01:32:02,349 --> 01:32:05,147
It's a sham wedding.
It's kind of stressful.

1613
01:32:05,186 --> 01:32:08,212
But then she goes ahead
and she leaves this note.

1614
01:32:08,255 --> 01:32:10,120
Because she doesn't have the decency...

1615
01:32:10,157 --> 01:32:12,284
the humanity to do it to my face.

1616
01:32:12,326 --> 01:32:17,423
Three years. Three years
I work with this... this terrorist.

1617
01:32:17,464 --> 01:32:19,056
Never once has she had
a nice thing to say,

1618
01:32:19,099 --> 01:32:20,964
and then she goes ahead
and she writes this crap!

1619
01:32:21,001 --> 01:32:22,764
- Andrew.
- But none of that matters

1620
01:32:22,803 --> 01:32:24,031
because we had a deal!

1621
01:32:24,071 --> 01:32:28,269
- Andrew.
- Sorry. I'm sorry. I just...

1622
01:32:28,309 --> 01:32:29,503
She just makes me a little crazy.

1623
01:32:29,543 --> 01:32:32,979
Yeah. I can see that.

1624
01:32:33,013 --> 01:32:37,074
So you're just gonna let her go?

1625
01:32:50,364 --> 01:32:52,332
So, what now?

1626
01:32:52,366 --> 01:32:55,335
Well... now that
you're leaving voluntarily,

1627
01:32:55,369 --> 01:32:58,065
it all becomes very civilized.

1628
01:32:58,105 --> 01:33:00,869
Once we land in New York,
you have 24 hours

1629
01:33:00,908 --> 01:33:03,934
to head back to Canada.

1630
01:33:11,318 --> 01:33:13,650
- Andrew, what's happening?
- I got to talk to her.

1631
01:33:13,687 --> 01:33:14,915
- Why would you do that?
- Boys!

1632
01:33:14,955 --> 01:33:15,979
This has nothing to do with you.

1633
01:33:16,023 --> 01:33:17,047
Boys, stop it! Stop it!

1634
01:33:17,091 --> 01:33:18,581
I'm not gonna let you do this.

1635
01:33:18,626 --> 01:33:20,093
I'm not asking
your permission here.

1636
01:33:20,127 --> 01:33:23,324
Annie! Joe! Joe!

1637
01:33:23,364 --> 01:33:26,561
Annie! Joe!

1638
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:29,592
I think I'm having a heart attack.

1639
01:33:29,637 --> 01:33:31,070
- Easy. Easy.
- Somebody get a doctor!

1640
01:33:31,105 --> 01:33:32,936
- Easy, easy.
- Get a doctor!

1641
01:33:36,977 --> 01:33:38,069
I got it.

1642
01:34:06,607 --> 01:34:08,336
Andrew.

1643
01:34:10,911 --> 01:34:14,312
You two need to stop fighting.

1644
01:34:14,348 --> 01:34:17,010
You'll never see eye to eye.

1645
01:34:18,319 --> 01:34:21,948
But you're family.

1646
01:34:25,292 --> 01:34:30,229
Promise me you'll stand by Andrew.

1647
01:34:30,264 --> 01:34:33,131
Even if... if you don't agree with him.

1648
01:34:35,502 --> 01:34:36,867
I promise.

1649
01:34:38,806 --> 01:34:41,240
Andrew.

1650
01:34:41,275 --> 01:34:47,236
Promise me you'll work harder
to be a part of this family.

1651
01:34:47,281 --> 01:34:49,306
I will.

1652
01:34:51,952 --> 01:34:54,284
I will, Gammy.

1653
01:34:54,321 --> 01:34:59,953
Well, then, the spirits can take me.

1654
01:34:59,994 --> 01:35:01,757
Oh, Annie.

1655
01:35:08,502 --> 01:35:10,163
Gammy?

1656
01:35:16,643 --> 01:35:18,372
I guess they're not ready for me.

1657
01:35:19,613 --> 01:35:21,444
I'm feeling much better, sonny.

1658
01:35:21,482 --> 01:35:23,382
No need to take us
to the hospital.

1659
01:35:23,417 --> 01:35:25,214
Take us to the airport, please.

1660
01:35:25,252 --> 01:35:27,083
Mom, what? Are you faking
the heart attack?

1661
01:35:27,121 --> 01:35:28,554
Oh, come on!

1662
01:35:28,589 --> 01:35:30,420
Well, it was the only
way I could get you two

1663
01:35:30,457 --> 01:35:32,857
to shut up and get us to the airport!

1664
01:35:32,893 --> 01:35:34,952
Ma'am, we're not authorized
to take you to the airport.

1665
01:35:34,995 --> 01:35:37,964
Larry Ferris, don't
make me call your mother.

1666
01:35:37,998 --> 01:35:40,159
You got it.

1667
01:35:41,735 --> 01:35:44,033
You scared the hell out of me.

1668
01:35:49,143 --> 01:35:53,204
Yep. You should've
given up back in New York.

1669
01:35:53,247 --> 01:35:56,478
See, I'm like Eliot Ness.

1670
01:35:56,517 --> 01:35:59,611
I always get my man.

1671
01:35:59,653 --> 01:36:02,679
I'm that good.

1672
01:36:02,723 --> 01:36:04,850
Flight 1601, as soon
as you're in position,

1673
01:36:04,892 --> 01:36:06,189
you're cleared for takeoff.

1674
01:36:06,226 --> 01:36:07,352
<i> Roger that, Chuck.</i>

1675
01:36:15,402 --> 01:36:17,302
OK. Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

1676
01:36:23,510 --> 01:36:25,068
Tower. Talk to me.

1677
01:36:25,112 --> 01:36:27,205
- Chuck! It's Drew Paxton.
- <i>Hey, dude.</i>

1678
01:36:27,247 --> 01:36:30,239
Hey, uh... I have a little
favor I need from you, buddy...

1679
01:36:30,284 --> 01:36:32,343
Margaret's on that plane. I got
to talk to her. Can you stop it?

1680
01:36:32,386 --> 01:36:33,683
<i> Oh, yeah!</i>

1681
01:36:33,720 --> 01:36:35,483
I heard about your lady bailin'.

1682
01:36:35,522 --> 01:36:38,548
- Drag-ola.
- <i> Chuck! I need you</i>

1683
01:36:38,592 --> 01:36:40,116
to stop the plane. Please.

1684
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:43,027
<i>I can't do that. </i>

1685
01:36:43,063 --> 01:36:46,396
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no! Come on!

1686
01:36:47,201 --> 01:36:48,600
Oh, no.

1687
01:36:50,771 --> 01:36:52,466
No!

1688
01:36:54,241 --> 01:36:56,141
- What's wrong?
- Margaret's on that plane.

1689
01:36:56,176 --> 01:36:58,440
- And he didn't get to tell her.
- Tell her what?

1690
01:36:58,479 --> 01:36:59,946
That he loves her.

1691
01:36:59,980 --> 01:37:02,813
So she could tell him
that she loves him, too.

1692
01:37:02,850 --> 01:37:04,010
OK, but how does he...

1693
01:37:04,051 --> 01:37:05,416
If she didn't love him,
she wouldn't have left.

1694
01:37:05,452 --> 01:37:06,942
Of course not.

1695
01:37:06,987 --> 01:37:08,511
Am I the only one not getting this?

1696
01:37:08,555 --> 01:37:12,423
- Oh, Joe!
- Chuck! Chuck! Look down.

1697
01:37:12,459 --> 01:37:13,926
Oh! Oh. Look down.

1698
01:37:13,961 --> 01:37:16,259
<i>Like... Oh, there you are!</i>

1699
01:37:16,296 --> 01:37:18,423
<i>Sorry, man. There was</i>
<i>nothing I could do.</i>

1700
01:37:20,434 --> 01:37:22,095
Thanks, Chuck.

1701
01:37:25,172 --> 01:37:29,438
I'm sorry, son. I didn't
know how you felt about her.

1702
01:37:34,648 --> 01:37:36,240
Honey, it's gonna be OK.

1703
01:38:09,716 --> 01:38:11,183
Jordan?

1704
01:38:29,503 --> 01:38:30,527
Jordan.

1705
01:38:31,905 --> 01:38:33,372
Jordan!

1706
01:38:33,407 --> 01:38:36,740
I need for you to send
the boxes in my office to...

1707
01:38:36,777 --> 01:38:38,369
...to this address, please.

1708
01:38:38,412 --> 01:38:42,746
This one right here.
This address right here. OK?

1709
01:38:42,783 --> 01:38:45,343
- Can you do that?
- Uh, yes. Sure.

1710
01:38:45,385 --> 01:38:47,250
- Good, all right. Thank you.
- Miss Tate.

1711
01:38:47,287 --> 01:38:50,484
Yes. What? What?

1712
01:38:52,359 --> 01:38:55,726
Hey.

1713
01:38:57,097 --> 01:38:59,725
Andrew.

1714
01:39:03,537 --> 01:39:06,165
Why are, why are you panting?

1715
01:39:06,206 --> 01:39:08,367
Because I've been running.

1716
01:39:08,408 --> 01:39:11,241
- Really. From Alaska?
- I need to talk to you.

1717
01:39:11,278 --> 01:39:12,973
Yeah? Well, I don't have time to talk.

1718
01:39:13,013 --> 01:39:15,413
I need to catch a 5:45 to Toronto.

1719
01:39:15,449 --> 01:39:17,144
- Margaret.
- I need the boxes to go out today.

1720
01:39:17,184 --> 01:39:18,242
I want to make sure everything is...

1721
01:39:18,285 --> 01:39:20,378
Margaret! Stop talking!

1722
01:39:24,491 --> 01:39:25,981
Gotta say something.

1723
01:39:26,026 --> 01:39:27,721
- OK.
- This will just take a sec.

1724
01:39:27,761 --> 01:39:29,661
Fine. What?

1725
01:39:30,664 --> 01:39:35,397
Three days ago, I loathed you.

1726
01:39:35,435 --> 01:39:37,630
I used to dream about you
getting hit by a cab.

1727
01:39:37,671 --> 01:39:38,968
Or poisoned.

1728
01:39:39,006 --> 01:39:42,601
- Oh, that's nice.
- I told you to stop talking.

1729
01:39:42,643 --> 01:39:45,237
Then we had our little
adventure up in Alaska

1730
01:39:45,279 --> 01:39:47,645
and things started to change.

1731
01:39:47,681 --> 01:39:50,343
Things changed when we kissed.

1732
01:39:52,319 --> 01:39:54,253
And when you told me about your tattoo.

1733
01:39:56,890 --> 01:39:59,085
Even when you checked me
out when we were naked.

1734
01:39:59,126 --> 01:40:00,491
Uh-huuuh.

1735
01:40:00,527 --> 01:40:01,653
Naked?

1736
01:40:01,695 --> 01:40:03,663
Well, I didn't see anything...

1737
01:40:03,697 --> 01:40:05,062
Yeah, you did.

1738
01:40:05,098 --> 01:40:09,364
But I didn't realize any of
this until I was standing alone.

1739
01:40:09,403 --> 01:40:13,203
In a barn... wife-less.

1740
01:40:13,240 --> 01:40:15,868
Now, you can imagine my disappointment

1741
01:40:15,909 --> 01:40:17,376
when it suddenly dawned on me

1742
01:40:17,411 --> 01:40:21,711
that the woman I love is about
to be kicked out of the country.

1743
01:40:24,318 --> 01:40:26,149
So, Margaret.

1744
01:40:28,388 --> 01:40:29,514
Marry me.

1745
01:40:32,959 --> 01:40:35,450
Because I'd like to date you.

1746
01:40:47,674 --> 01:40:51,007
Trust me. You don't really
want to be with me.

1747
01:40:51,044 --> 01:40:52,773
Yes, I do.

1748
01:40:54,414 --> 01:40:57,406
See, the thing is, there is a reason why

1749
01:40:57,451 --> 01:41:00,045
I've been alone all this time.

1750
01:41:00,087 --> 01:41:02,055
I'm comfortable that way.

1751
01:41:02,089 --> 01:41:04,114
And I think it would
just be a lot easier

1752
01:41:04,157 --> 01:41:10,187
if we forgot everything
that happened and I just left.

1753
01:41:12,065 --> 01:41:13,657
You're right.

1754
01:41:19,172 --> 01:41:21,766
That would be easier.

1755
01:41:37,557 --> 01:41:41,015
- I'm scared.
- Me, too.

1756
01:42:04,885 --> 01:42:07,820
Aren't you supposed to get down
on your knee or something?

1757
01:42:07,854 --> 01:42:09,378
I'm gonna take that as a "yes."

1758
01:42:09,423 --> 01:42:11,448
Oh, OK.

1759
01:42:25,972 --> 01:42:28,907
Yeah! Show her
who's boss, Andrew!

1760
01:42:37,017 --> 01:42:40,646
So, let me see
if I've got this right.

1761
01:42:40,687 --> 01:42:43,121
You two are engaged again.

1762
01:42:43,156 --> 01:42:44,714
- Yes.
- Yes.

1763
01:42:44,758 --> 01:42:46,851
For real?

1764
01:42:47,794 --> 01:42:48,954
- Yes.
- Yeah.

1765
01:42:48,995 --> 01:42:50,053
You're sure you want to
go through with this?

1766
01:42:50,096 --> 01:42:51,222
Because one wrong answer...

1767
01:42:51,264 --> 01:42:54,461
I'm gonna take you down.

1768
01:42:56,837 --> 01:42:59,533
- OK.
- OK.

1769
01:43:01,174 --> 01:43:02,471
Let's do it.

1770
01:43:11,918 --> 01:43:13,442
When did you
first start to date?

1771
01:43:13,487 --> 01:43:15,352
Last week.

1772
01:43:15,388 --> 01:43:18,619
- That going well?
- So far it's great. Thank you.

1773
01:43:18,658 --> 01:43:20,148
What kind of
deodorant does Andrew use?

1774
01:43:20,193 --> 01:43:21,751
Men's Speed Stick?

1775
01:43:21,795 --> 01:43:25,094
What flavor? Musk? Alpine?

1776
01:43:25,131 --> 01:43:26,428
Was it love at first sight?

1777
01:43:26,466 --> 01:43:28,593
No.

1778
01:43:28,635 --> 01:43:32,469
I loved her from the beginning.

1779
01:43:32,506 --> 01:43:33,768
What side of the
bed does Margaret sleep on?

1780
01:43:33,807 --> 01:43:35,536
She sleeps on the left.

1781
01:43:35,575 --> 01:43:37,008
What side of the bed do you sleep on?

1782
01:43:39,045 --> 01:43:43,379
Look, are they soul mates? Eeeh.

1783
01:43:43,416 --> 01:43:46,044
Uh... Will they kill each other? No.

1784
01:43:46,086 --> 01:43:47,212
Are you a good driver?

1785
01:43:47,254 --> 01:43:49,848
Oh, excellent driver. Excellent.

1786
01:43:53,627 --> 01:43:56,027
Oh.

1787
01:43:56,062 --> 01:43:59,054
In my mind I see her
with someone perhaps...

1788
01:43:59,099 --> 01:44:00,999
...more swarthy, darker.

1789
01:44:01,034 --> 01:44:03,662
We don't use the word
"Margaret" around Kevin.

1790
01:44:03,703 --> 01:44:08,003
He still hasn't warmed up to her.

1791
01:44:08,041 --> 01:44:09,736
Margaret.

1792
01:44:09,776 --> 01:44:11,767
Margaret.

1793
01:44:11,811 --> 01:44:13,540
See? It's the damnedest thing.

1794
01:44:13,580 --> 01:44:15,207
I have never farted in front of him.

1795
01:44:15,248 --> 01:44:17,648
Nor will I ever fart in front of him.

1796
01:44:17,684 --> 01:44:20,209
She farts in her sleep.

1797
01:44:20,253 --> 01:44:22,153
Would you consider
Margaret a good dancer?

1798
01:44:22,188 --> 01:44:25,419
You can tell by the way
she drinks her soda pop

1799
01:44:25,458 --> 01:44:27,824
that she's a good dancer.

1800
01:44:27,861 --> 01:44:29,089
Uh-huh. How, how...

1801
01:44:29,129 --> 01:44:33,566
How is the soda pop
relevant to the dancing?

1802
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:35,261
I don't understand this.

1803
01:44:35,302 --> 01:44:38,237
- I call him... puppy.
- Pumpkin.

1804
01:44:38,271 --> 01:44:39,932
- Monkey.
- Daisy.

1805
01:44:39,973 --> 01:44:42,168
- Kiddo.
- Uh... Bird.

1806
01:44:42,208 --> 01:44:45,405
Sometimes I call him Rick.

1807
01:44:45,445 --> 01:44:46,912
How do you spell "Ramone?"

1808
01:44:46,947 --> 01:44:49,814
R-A-M-O-N-E.

1809
01:44:49,849 --> 01:44:51,749
Could you do that
again in English, please?

1810
01:44:51,785 --> 01:44:54,652
When you say, you know, the
position in the relationship...

1811
01:44:54,688 --> 01:44:56,053
Top or bottom?

1812
01:44:56,089 --> 01:44:59,058
You're asking me a question
about who's on top?

1813
01:44:59,092 --> 01:45:00,821
You took an oath
when you walked in this office.

1814
01:45:00,860 --> 01:45:03,328
I did not take an oath.
When did I take an oath?

1815
01:45:03,363 --> 01:45:04,625
Laura should've
done that, but she didn't.

1816
01:45:04,664 --> 01:45:06,529
- That's OK.
- Who's Laura?

1817
01:45:06,566 --> 01:45:08,898
She's the girl behind you.
Don't look around.

1818
01:45:08,935 --> 01:45:10,197
Which of
the following numbers

1819
01:45:10,236 --> 01:45:13,034
- is not a prime?
- Seventeen.

1820
01:45:13,073 --> 01:45:15,234
I'm sorry. Let me say the list, please.

1821
01:45:15,275 --> 01:45:16,299
I'm sorry?

1822
01:45:16,343 --> 01:45:17,605
He knew
your favorite color.

1823
01:45:17,644 --> 01:45:19,271
- Blue?
- Wrong!

1824
01:45:19,312 --> 01:45:20,836
- Red?
- No!

1825
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:22,404
Dark... Maybe like a hunter green?

1826
01:45:22,449 --> 01:45:23,848
No. White.

1827
01:45:23,883 --> 01:45:25,145
- White?
- OK, moving on.

1828
01:45:25,185 --> 01:45:26,584
Favorite color is blue.

1829
01:45:26,620 --> 01:45:30,522
What's her favorite color
when she's not at home?

1830
01:45:30,557 --> 01:45:31,956
I don't know.

1831
01:45:31,992 --> 01:45:33,755
Are you a citizen
of this country, Ramone?

1832
01:45:33,793 --> 01:45:37,661
Yes, I'm a citizen!
Are you crazy?

1833
01:45:39,699 --> 01:45:42,600
What relevance a ball in a net

1834
01:45:42,636 --> 01:45:44,570
or a Fruit Roll-Up or a Pop-Tart

1835
01:45:44,604 --> 01:45:47,164
has to do with my
relationship with Andrew?

1836
01:45:47,207 --> 01:45:48,731
If you're
getting excited...

1837
01:45:48,775 --> 01:45:51,903
Who are you engaged to?

1838
01:45:51,945 --> 01:45:56,143
- Andrew.
- Very good. Got one right.

1839
01:45:56,182 --> 01:45:57,342
Who are you engaged to?

1840
01:45:57,384 --> 01:45:59,079
I'm engaged to Margaret Tate.

1841
01:45:59,119 --> 01:46:04,580
And on the wedding day,
who will be next to you?

1842
01:46:04,624 --> 01:46:06,922
I'm going to marry Margaret Tate.

1843
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:09,656
- Final answer?
- That work? Yeah, final answer.

1844
01:46:09,696 --> 01:46:12,995
Is this a game show?
I don't understand what...

1845
01:46:20,106 --> 01:46:21,573
That's a great song.

1846
01:46:21,608 --> 01:46:23,337
That was beautiful.
That was really beautiful.

1847
01:46:23,376 --> 01:46:25,037
Mama Cass.

1848
01:47:25,038 --> 01:47:26,038
