333
00:33:42,313 --> 00:33:44,975
An Einstein-Rosen Bridge
is a theoretical connection

334
00:33:45,049 --> 00:33:46,311
between two different points
of space-time.

335
00:33:46,384 --> 00:33:47,715

- Stars.

Yeah, but not our stars.

338

See, this is the star alignment
for our quadrant this time of year,

No, it can't be.

- We find him.

Did you see what he did in there?

352
00:35:11,536 --> 00:35:13,299
I'm not sure finding him is the best idea.

Well, our data can't tell us
what it was like to be inside that event,

he's only banished, not dead.

if that guard hadn't told Odin
where we'd gone.

How did the guard even know?

I told him.

What?

388
00:38:05,276 --> 00:38:07,870
I told him to go to Odin after we'd left.

00:38:08,045 --> 00:38:09,376
He should be flogged for taking so long.

You must go to the All father

And if I do, then what?

00:38:27,231 --> 00:38:30,064
I love Thor more dearly than any of you,
but you know what he is.

399
00:38:30,635 --> 00:38:33,263
He's arrogant.
He's reckless. He's dangerous.

You saw how he was today.

Is that what Asgard needs from its king?

402

He may speak of the good of Asgard,
but he's always been jealous of Thor.

Why?

427
00:40:43,367 --> 00:40:46,700
You were knee-deep in Jotun blood,
why would you take me?

428
00:40:46,771 --> 00:40:48,261
You were an innocent child.

429
00:40:48,372 --> 00:40:52,365
No. You took me for a purpose.
What was it?

(SHOUTING) Tell me!

we could unite our kingdoms one day.

But those plans no longer matter.

436
00:41:13,898 --> 00:41:17,129
So I am no more
than another stolen relic,

Why do you twist my words?

439
00:41:21,305 --> 00:41:23,296
You could have told me what I was
from the beginning,

440
00:41:23,407 --> 00:41:24,396
why didn't you?

441

You're my son.

442
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:28,469
I wanted only to protect you
from the truth.

443

- No, no.
- You know, it all makes sense now!

446

Why you favored Thor all these years!

you claim to love me,

- He's delusional.

Listen to what he's saying.

502
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:33,362
He's talking about Mjolnir
and Thor and Bifrost.

to a king who had murdered
his predecessor.

810
01:10:03,052 --> 01:10:06,112
Once Odin is dead,
I will return the Casket to you

811
01:10:08,224 --> 01:10:11,216
and you can return Jotunheim to all its...

812
01:10:14,097 --> 01:10:15,428
Glory.

813
01:10:16,733 --> 01:10:18,064
I...

814
01:10:19,569 --> 01:10:21,400
Accept.

815
01:10:27,243 --> 01:10:28,801
What troubles you, Gatekeeper?

816
01:10:29,078 --> 01:10:34,072
I turned my gaze upon you in Jotunheim,
but could neither see you nor hear you.

817
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:35,979
You were shrouded from me,

818
01:10:36,085 --> 01:10:38,246
like the Frost Giants
that entered this realm.

819
01:10:38,588 --> 01:10:41,921
Perhaps your senses have weakened
after your many years of service.

820
01:10:41,991 --> 01:10:43,652
Or perhaps someone has found a way

821
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:46,820
to hide that
which he does not wish me to see.

822
01:10:48,097 --> 01:10:50,156
You have great power, Heimdall.

823
01:10:52,669 --> 01:10:54,159
Did Odin ever fear you?

824
01:10:56,439 --> 01:10:58,100
- No.
- And why is that?

825
01:10:58,341 --> 01:11:01,435
Because he is my king
and I am sworn to obey him.

826
01:11:01,778 --> 01:11:05,942
He was your king
and you're sworn to obey me now.

827
01:11:06,783 --> 01:11:07,841
Yes?

828
01:11:13,356 --> 01:11:14,687
Yes.

829
01:11:15,391 --> 01:11:18,121
Then you will open the Bifrost to no one

830
01:11:18,194 --> 01:11:21,027
until I have repaired the damage
that my brother has done.

836
01:11:44,554 --> 01:11:46,044

I'm really glad you're safe.

854

You've been very kind to me,

855
01:13:11,107 --> 01:13:13,302
and I've been far less grateful
than you deserve.

856
01:13:13,476 --> 01:13:15,171
Well, I hit you with my car
a couple times,

857

Listen to me. You must not give up.

Here, look.

Your ancestors called it magic,
and you call it science.

Well, I come from a place
where they're one and the same thing.

What is that?

877
01:14:33,823 --> 01:14:36,917
My father explained it to me like this,

878
01:14:37,026 --> 01:14:38,755
that your world

879
01:14:38,861 --> 01:14:41,694
is one of the Nine Realms
of the Cosmos,

880

linked to each other
by the branches of Yggdrasil,

break every oath you

I could have done it!

1135
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:27,371
For you!

1136
01:40:28,075 --> 01:40:29,565
For all of us!

1137
01:40:31,746 --> 01:40:33,077
No, Loki.

1138
01:40:41,823 --> 01:40:42,812
Loki, no.

1139
01:40:44,091 --> 01:40:46,252
No!

1140
01:40:50,498 --> 01:40:51,658
No.

1141
01:41:08,015 --> 01:41:09,346
JANE: It's gone.

1142
01:42:16,584 --> 01:42:18,518
(ALL LAUGHING)

1143
01:42:21,889 --> 01:42:24,722
And then, with a mighty bellow,

1144
01:42:24,992 --> 01:42:29,053
I flew into the giant metal creature
and laid him low!

1145
01:42:29,230 --> 01:42:32,825
FANDRAL: Is that another way of saying
you fell on your huge ass?

1146
01:42:32,900 --> 01:42:38,896
VOLSTAGG: As a matter of fact, falling
was a tactic lulling the Destroyer...

1147
01:42:53,087 --> 01:42:55,920
My Queen, I'm so sorry for your loss.

1148
01:43:01,762 --> 01:43:03,093
<i>FRIGGA: How Is he?</i>

1149
01:43:05,433 --> 01:43:07,424
<i>SIF: He mourns for his brother.</i>

1150
01:43:08,769 --> 01:43:09,929
<i>And...</i>

1151
01:43:11,105 --> 01:43:12,697
<i>He misses her.</i>

1152
01:43:13,708 --> 01:43:15,039
<i>The mortal.</i>

1153
01:43:31,459 --> 01:43:33,222
You'll be a wise king.

1154
01:43:37,632 --> 01:43:40,066
There will never be
a wiser king than you.

1155
01:43:41,469 --> 01:43:43,130
Or a better father.

1156
01:43:54,015 --> 01:43:57,178
I have much to learn.

1157
01:43:59,186 --> 01:44:00,676
I know that now.

1158
01:44:05,693 --> 01:44:07,661
Someday, perhaps,

1159
01:44:08,963 --> 01:44:10,863
I shall make you proud.

1160
01:44:18,506 --> 01:44:20,701
You've already made me proud.

1161
01:44:35,289 --> 01:44:37,280
So Earth is lost to us.

1162
01:44:38,626 --> 01:44:39,615
No.

1163
01:44:40,628 --> 01:44:42,619
There is always hope.

1164
01:44:46,634 --> 01:44:48,124
Can you see her?

1165
01:44:49,403 --> 01:44:50,961
(HEIMDALL LAUGHS)

1166
01:44:51,038 --> 01:44:52,369
<i>Yes.</i>

1167
01:44:56,043 --> 01:44:57,977
ERIK: I have the particle detectors!

1168
01:44:58,045 --> 01:45:00,138
Darcy, do you have the S.H.I.E.L.D.
satellite codes?

1169
01:45:00,214 --> 01:45:02,307
DARCY: Yeah. Have you seen my taser?

1170
01:45:02,383 --> 01:45:03,816
<i>THOR: How is she?</i>

1171
01:45:03,884 --> 01:45:05,977
ERIK: In the car. Come on, Jane!

1172
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:08,379
<i>HEIMDALL: She searches for you.</i>

1173
01:53:17,978 --> 01:53:19,878
NICK FURY: Dr. Selvig.

1174
01:53:22,716 --> 01:53:24,877
So you're the man behind all this?

1175
01:53:27,054 --> 01:53:29,045
It's quite a labyrinth.

1176
01:53:29,823 --> 01:53:33,725
I was thinking
they're taking me down here to kill me.

1177
01:53:40,901 --> 01:53:43,893
I've been hearing
about the New Mexico situation.

1178
01:53:44,738 --> 01:53:48,401
Your work has impressed a lot of people
who are much smarter than I am.

1179
01:53:48,508 --> 01:53:50,499
I have a lot to work with.

1180
01:53:51,078 --> 01:53:54,377
The Foster Theory.
A gateway to another dimension.

1181
01:53:55,048 --> 01:53:56,037
It's unprecedented.

1182
01:53:58,752 --> 01:54:00,014
Isn't it?

1183
01:54:03,423 --> 01:54:06,756
Legend tells us one thing,
history, another.

1184
01:54:07,094 --> 01:54:11,292
But every now and then,
we find something that belongs to both.

1185
01:54:19,106 --> 01:54:20,095
What is it?

1186
01:54:20,207 --> 01:54:21,299
Power, Doctor.

1187
01:54:21,875 --> 01:54:23,866
If we can figure out how to tap it,

1188
01:54:24,278 --> 01:54:25,768
maybe unlimited power.

1189
01:54:31,551 --> 01:54:33,781
Well, I guess that's worth a look.

1190
01:54:35,555 --> 01:54:37,785
Well, I guess that's worth a look.
