1
00:00:35,213 --> 00:00:37,647
Bear witness, Zeus...

2
00:00:37,853 --> 00:00:40,606
...and all you gods of high Olympus!

3
00:00:41,133 --> 00:00:43,363
I condemn my daughter, Danae...

4
00:00:44,013 --> 00:00:46,891
...and her son, Perseus, to the sea!

5
00:00:47,573 --> 00:00:49,131
Her guilt and sin...

6
00:00:49,933 --> 00:00:52,288
...have brought shame to Argos.

7
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:54,848
I, Acrisius, the king...

8
00:00:55,293 --> 00:00:59,047
...now purge her crime
and restore my honor!

9
00:00:59,813 --> 00:01:03,328
Their blood is not on my hands!

10
00:01:07,053 --> 00:01:08,725
Now!

11
00:04:49,933 --> 00:04:51,366
It is done.

12
00:04:51,533 --> 00:04:54,923
As we feared, King Acrisius of Argos
has abandoned his daughter...

13
00:04:55,133 --> 00:04:57,283
...and her child to the sea.

14
00:04:57,493 --> 00:05:00,166
Then he will be punished.

15
00:05:00,493 --> 00:05:04,202
Cruel and ruthless crime! Blasphemy!

16
00:05:04,853 --> 00:05:09,927
How dare the tyrant pray to me
to forgive his savage jealousy...

17
00:05:10,093 --> 00:05:11,572
...and cowardly revenge!

18
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:15,971
Acrisius has always shown devotion
to the gods of Olympus!

19
00:05:16,173 --> 00:05:20,007
He has built many temples
and dedicated them to you...

20
00:05:20,213 --> 00:05:22,852
...great Zeus, father of the gods.

21
00:05:23,053 --> 00:05:26,602
A hundred good deeds cannot atone
for one murder.

22
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:31,008
A thousand temples or statues,
or sanctuaries...

23
00:05:31,173 --> 00:05:36,042
...whether dedicated to me, or to you,
Hera, my wife...

24
00:05:36,653 --> 00:05:40,328
...or to Thetis, lovely goddess
of the sea.

25
00:05:40,493 --> 00:05:45,851
Or to you, Athena,
ever wise and full of care.

26
00:05:46,093 --> 00:05:48,971
Or to Aphrodite, goddess of love.

27
00:05:49,813 --> 00:05:53,522
Nothing can wipe out or forgive...

28
00:05:53,733 --> 00:05:56,372
...this one contemptible act of blood!

29
00:05:56,653 --> 00:05:58,245
Does it matter?

30
00:05:58,413 --> 00:06:00,847
The death of a girl and her child?

31
00:06:01,053 --> 00:06:04,045
Girl? His daughter!

32
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:09,806
- After a lifetime's devotion...
- Enough! I've decided.

33
00:06:10,213 --> 00:06:13,444
Acrisius must be punished...

34
00:06:13,653 --> 00:06:16,167
...and his people with him.

35
00:06:16,693 --> 00:06:18,251
My lord, Poseidon...

36
00:06:18,413 --> 00:06:21,962
...I command you to raise
the wind and the sea.

37
00:06:22,213 --> 00:06:24,363
Destroy Argos!

38
00:06:24,573 --> 00:06:28,566
And to make certain no stone stands,
that no creature crawls...

39
00:06:28,773 --> 00:06:32,368
...I command you to let loose
the last of the Titans.

40
00:06:32,573 --> 00:06:34,962
Let loose the Kraken!

41
00:06:35,173 --> 00:06:38,085
The kingdom of Acrisius
must be destroyed!

42
00:06:38,293 --> 00:06:40,443
As you command.

43
00:06:40,653 --> 00:06:43,292
Yet, be certain...

44
00:06:43,493 --> 00:06:47,088
...no harm befalls
young Danae or her son.

45
00:06:47,293 --> 00:06:52,765
Bring them safe to some remote
and peaceful shore. Go now, swiftly.

46
00:06:58,693 --> 00:07:02,481
No pity, no mercy. Why?

47
00:07:02,693 --> 00:07:05,605
Zeus, your husband, loved the girl.

48
00:07:05,813 --> 00:07:08,611
- Danae?
- She is very beautiful.

49
00:07:08,773 --> 00:07:13,130
So beautiful that Acrisius grew
jealous and guarded her from men...

50
00:07:13,293 --> 00:07:15,045
...Iocked behind iron doors.

51
00:07:15,213 --> 00:07:18,922
But Zeus transformed himself
into a shower of gold and visited her...

52
00:07:19,213 --> 00:07:23,001
...visted her and loved her.
- Then why should I show compassion?

53
00:07:23,213 --> 00:07:27,968
- Let her drown! With her child!
- The child, Perseus, is Zeus' son.

54
00:07:28,373 --> 00:07:31,365
That is why he is to be saved...

55
00:07:32,133 --> 00:07:36,206
...and why Argos is doomed.

56
00:11:00,013 --> 00:11:05,292
Danae and her child have been brought
safely to the island of Seriphos.

57
00:11:05,493 --> 00:11:07,643
Seriphos.

58
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:13,132
There let Danae and her child live,
safe...

59
00:11:13,293 --> 00:11:15,204
...and happy.

60
00:12:30,493 --> 00:12:33,087
Perseus, grown to a young man.

61
00:12:33,773 --> 00:12:38,244
He's had a happy childhood. With
a strong body and a handsome face...

62
00:12:38,453 --> 00:12:41,445
...what more could any mortal
desire or deserve?

63
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:44,486
And what of my son Calibos?

64
00:12:44,773 --> 00:12:46,729
His crimes are unforgivable.

65
00:12:47,373 --> 00:12:52,493
- Be merciful to him. Show pity.
- Impossible!

66
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:54,445
Calibos...

67
00:12:54,653 --> 00:12:56,962
...had every advantage!

68
00:12:57,173 --> 00:13:00,961
You, as patron goddess
of the city of Joppa, have spoiled...

69
00:13:01,173 --> 00:13:03,892
...and indulged him since birth.

70
00:13:04,173 --> 00:13:09,611
You let him rule the Wells of the Moon,
and he destroyed every living creature!

71
00:13:10,093 --> 00:13:14,245
He's trapped and killed
my sacred herd of flying horses...

72
00:13:14,453 --> 00:13:18,969
...and now only the stallion,
Pegasus, remains.

73
00:13:19,373 --> 00:13:24,493
- Your son must therefore be punished.
- No, I beg you. Be merciful.

74
00:13:26,493 --> 00:13:29,769
He will become abhorrent
to human sight.

75
00:13:31,093 --> 00:13:36,247
He'll be shunned and forced to live as an
outcast in the swamps and marshes.

76
00:13:36,453 --> 00:13:40,002
He'll be transformed
to a mortal mockery.

77
00:13:40,173 --> 00:13:44,963
The shameful mark of his vile cruelty.

78
00:13:56,653 --> 00:13:59,770
This is my final judgement.

79
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:01,645
No, I implore you.

80
00:14:02,013 --> 00:14:04,527
He is to marry Princess Andromeda.

81
00:14:05,173 --> 00:14:08,324
He would rule all Joppa and Phoenicia.

82
00:14:08,493 --> 00:14:11,405
Let the princess look upon him now!

83
00:14:14,613 --> 00:14:18,401
Be comforted. He may change his mind.

84
00:14:18,693 --> 00:14:23,209
Had it been his own child Perseus,
he would have forgiven him.

85
00:14:23,413 --> 00:14:28,043
But for my son Calibos,
there is to be no mercy, no hope.

86
00:14:28,253 --> 00:14:33,611
- And no marriage with Andromeda.
- How can there be now?

87
00:14:36,653 --> 00:14:39,372
Yet if my son...

88
00:14:39,533 --> 00:14:42,127
...is not to marry her...

89
00:14:45,493 --> 00:14:48,246
...then no man will.

90
00:14:48,453 --> 00:14:52,002
My priests of Joppa are loyal.

91
00:14:52,493 --> 00:14:57,442
I will speak to them
in dreams and omens.

92
00:14:57,773 --> 00:15:00,810
As my Calibos suffers...

93
00:15:01,293 --> 00:15:03,853
...so will Andromeda.

94
00:15:05,453 --> 00:15:06,681
I promise you.

95
00:15:08,613 --> 00:15:13,812
<i>The son of Zeus is to be left</i>
<i>to the whim of chance...</i>

96
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:17,972
<i>... while mine is punished</i>
<i>with deformity.</i>

97
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:23,048
<i>It is time for chance to intervene.</i>

98
00:15:23,613 --> 00:15:26,730
Time you saw something
of the world, Perseus.

99
00:15:27,253 --> 00:15:30,086
<i>Time you came face to face with fear.</i>

100
00:15:30,293 --> 00:15:34,889
<i>Time to know the terrors of the dark</i>
<i>and look on death.</i>

101
00:15:35,293 --> 00:15:39,684
Time your eyes were opened
to grim reality.

102
00:15:39,893 --> 00:15:43,329
Far to the east, across the sea...

103
00:15:43,533 --> 00:15:45,444
...in Joppa...

104
00:15:45,613 --> 00:15:49,083
...in the kingdom of Phoenicia.

105
00:16:20,093 --> 00:16:22,732
Who are you?

106
00:16:27,613 --> 00:16:29,285
Who are you?

107
00:16:29,493 --> 00:16:30,562
Show yourself!

108
00:16:36,093 --> 00:16:38,084
Who are you?

109
00:16:41,293 --> 00:16:44,330
- First tell me where I am!
- "Where"?

110
00:16:45,373 --> 00:16:46,726
Where am I?

111
00:16:46,933 --> 00:16:50,050
You mean you don't know
where you are?

112
00:16:50,253 --> 00:16:51,288
I don't know.

113
00:16:51,493 --> 00:16:55,247
Now le?s be patient for a moment.
My name is Ammon.

114
00:16:55,453 --> 00:16:58,092
I am a poet and a playwright.
And you?

115
00:16:58,253 --> 00:17:00,209
My name is Perseus.

116
00:17:00,413 --> 00:17:03,849
- I am heir to the kingdom of Argos.
- By the gods!

117
00:17:04,013 --> 00:17:05,492
How did you get here?

118
00:17:06,093 --> 00:17:08,368
I'm not sure I know where "here" is.

119
00:17:08,573 --> 00:17:12,009
Well, this is the amphitheater
of Joppa.

120
00:17:12,373 --> 00:17:14,887
- Where?
- The great city of Joppa.

121
00:17:16,933 --> 00:17:18,844
But how?

122
00:17:20,493 --> 00:17:24,008
I was lying on the seashore,
looking up at the moon.

123
00:17:24,173 --> 00:17:25,925
Oh, the moon!

124
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:29,325
That might explain things.
You see, the moon...

125
00:17:29,533 --> 00:17:31,125
...affects the brain.

126
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:36,453
I think we'd be safer inside,
out of the night air.

127
00:17:37,653 --> 00:17:42,602
I must apologize for this dramatic
finery and the theatrical effects.

128
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:45,646
I put them on to frighten away
the curious.

129
00:17:45,853 --> 00:17:48,811
It makes them think
the theater is haunted.

130
00:17:48,973 --> 00:17:52,682
- Why is everything so neglected?
- It's a sign of the times.

131
00:17:52,893 --> 00:17:56,647
This kingdom is cursed,
and the city is in despair.

132
00:17:56,813 --> 00:17:58,929
Everyone goes around muttering:

133
00:17:59,133 --> 00:18:03,809
"Call no man happy who is not dead!"

134
00:18:05,133 --> 00:18:07,089
Now then, my young friend.

135
00:18:07,293 --> 00:18:11,844
You say your name is Perseus,
heir to the kingdom of Argos?

136
00:18:12,453 --> 00:18:14,125
Yes.

137
00:18:14,733 --> 00:18:17,964
But up to now I've lived
all my life in Seriphos.

138
00:18:18,493 --> 00:18:22,042
Someday I will return
to reclaim Argos.

139
00:18:23,173 --> 00:18:26,245
- After I was born, my mother and l...
- I know!

140
00:18:26,933 --> 00:18:29,003
- You do?
- Certainly.

141
00:18:29,213 --> 00:18:32,808
The beautiful princess
and the jealous tyrant...

142
00:18:32,973 --> 00:18:36,010
...you and your mother
thrown into the sea...

143
00:18:36,213 --> 00:18:38,249
...and the destruction of Argos.

144
00:18:38,413 --> 00:18:42,008
It's been a popular story here
for the past 20 years.

145
00:18:42,213 --> 00:18:44,408
I, myself, wrote a poem about it.

146
00:18:44,613 --> 00:18:48,492
- Rather moving, as I recall.
- Then...

147
00:18:49,013 --> 00:18:52,642
...can you explain
what happened to me tonight?

148
00:18:52,853 --> 00:18:57,165
The gods of Olympus are mysterious,
and their motives are erratic.

149
00:18:57,373 --> 00:18:58,806
My advice to you:

150
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:03,723
Return to the calm of Seriphos
as quickly as you can.

151
00:19:04,453 --> 00:19:08,651
But my mother's last wish was
that I would restore her homeland.

152
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:16,409
Joppa would be a better starting place
than some remote little island.

153
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:18,092
Well, in that case...

154
00:19:18,293 --> 00:19:21,888
...you ought to get something
more becoming to wear.

155
00:19:22,093 --> 00:19:24,323
I mean, something more fitting...

156
00:19:24,493 --> 00:19:29,123
...something more appropriate
for a prince, so to speak. Get out!

157
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,483
And look at this!

158
00:19:34,053 --> 00:19:36,772
Ah, that looks well.

159
00:19:36,973 --> 00:19:41,012
That will do very well.

160
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:43,767
Your sword.

161
00:19:44,493 --> 00:19:49,169
Welcome to Joppa, Prince Perseus.

162
00:19:53,613 --> 00:19:58,892
You set him down half-naked
in a strange, despairing city?

163
00:19:59,093 --> 00:20:02,483
- Chance?
- Not chance and you know it!

164
00:20:02,693 --> 00:20:07,369
A deliberate and malicious act
unworthy of a goddess!

165
00:20:07,533 --> 00:20:12,049
- You accuse me?
- Well, one thing is certain.

166
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:16,166
My son needs more than an actor's
cloak and a wooden sword!

167
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:21,123
Provide him with suitable weapons.
Weapons of divine temper.

168
00:20:21,293 --> 00:20:22,567
A helmet!

169
00:20:23,053 --> 00:20:24,168
A sword!

170
00:20:25,293 --> 00:20:26,851
A shield!

171
00:20:27,053 --> 00:20:29,931
And he must have them with all speed!

172
00:20:33,173 --> 00:20:36,051
- All for love of Danae.
- No!

173
00:20:36,213 --> 00:20:39,922
So many women have attracted him,
he couldn't remember her.

174
00:20:40,093 --> 00:20:42,926
It's his foolish pride
in a handsome son.

175
00:20:43,133 --> 00:20:48,002
As you say, so many women. And all
these transformations he invents...

176
00:20:48,173 --> 00:20:51,449
...to seduce them.
Sometimes a shower of gold...

177
00:20:51,653 --> 00:20:56,169
...a bull or a swan. He tried
to ravish me disguised as a cuttlefish.

178
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:59,723
- Did he succeed?
- Certainly not.

179
00:20:59,973 --> 00:21:03,010
- What did you do?
- Beat him at his own game.

180
00:21:03,213 --> 00:21:05,408
I turned myself into a shark.

181
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:03,769
Why, you're up with the sun.
Beautiful morning!

182
00:22:03,973 --> 00:22:05,770
Magical!

183
00:22:05,933 --> 00:22:08,003
I found this here by the statue.

184
00:22:08,213 --> 00:22:12,525
That is the likeness of the goddess
of love. It's remarkable.

185
00:22:12,733 --> 00:22:15,566
- A sword, eh?
- Yes.

186
00:22:15,773 --> 00:22:18,890
- This is no ordinary sword.
- It's a strange metal.

187
00:22:19,093 --> 00:22:23,848
It's neither brass nor iron.
It's like no metal I have ever seen.

188
00:22:28,173 --> 00:22:30,403
By the gods!

189
00:22:31,053 --> 00:22:32,202
There's a shield!

190
00:22:32,933 --> 00:22:35,049
And over there's a helmet!

191
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:37,687
I was right to say, "By the gods!"

192
00:22:37,893 --> 00:22:39,884
Who else could make a sword...

193
00:22:40,093 --> 00:22:42,891
...that slices through solid marble...

194
00:22:43,053 --> 00:22:47,046
...without leaving the slightest
blemish on the blade?

195
00:22:48,373 --> 00:22:51,251
If the sword can do that...

196
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:54,251
...what about the helmet
and the shield?

197
00:22:54,453 --> 00:22:57,684
We'd better...
That is, you'd better find out.

198
00:22:58,813 --> 00:23:02,726
- I'll try the helmet.
<i>- No! Try me first.</i>

199
00:23:02,893 --> 00:23:05,726
- What did you say?
- I didn't say anything.

200
00:23:05,933 --> 00:23:10,882
The sound came from over by
that statue of Hera. From that shield!

201
00:23:19,533 --> 00:23:22,093
<i>Turn me around!</i>

202
00:23:29,653 --> 00:23:31,245
<i>Perseus!</i>

203
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:34,092
<i>Perseus, Perseus.</i>

204
00:23:35,853 --> 00:23:38,048
<i>Mark me, Perseus.</i>

205
00:23:38,213 --> 00:23:40,647
<i>These weapons are gifts from the gods.</i>

206
00:23:40,973 --> 00:23:44,852
<i>Guard well this shield...</i>

207
00:23:45,053 --> 00:23:49,524
<i>... for one day it will</i>
<i>guard your life.</i>

208
00:23:49,853 --> 00:23:52,048
Guard my life?

209
00:23:52,733 --> 00:23:55,486
- When?
<i>- You will know...</i>

210
00:23:55,693 --> 00:23:58,127
<i>... when the day comes.</i>

211
00:23:59,213 --> 00:24:02,489
- What about the helmet?
<i>- It has the power...</i>

212
00:24:02,693 --> 00:24:05,161
<i>... to render its wearer...</i>

213
00:24:05,853 --> 00:24:07,889
<i>... invisible.</i>

214
00:24:08,093 --> 00:24:10,129
Invisible?

215
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:13,047
<i>Invisible.</i>

216
00:24:14,413 --> 00:24:15,732
Wait!

217
00:24:15,933 --> 00:24:18,288
Wait. Who are you?

218
00:24:19,653 --> 00:24:24,169
<i>Find and fulfill your destiny.</i>

219
00:24:26,693 --> 00:24:28,684
Destiny?

220
00:24:32,413 --> 00:24:35,803
A divine gift should never
be questioned...

221
00:24:36,293 --> 00:24:38,727
...simply accepted.

222
00:24:43,373 --> 00:24:45,568
Invisible.

223
00:25:10,853 --> 00:25:12,764
Can you see me?

224
00:25:12,973 --> 00:25:15,009
Nothing.

225
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:18,683
Nothing of you at all!
Where are you?

226
00:25:18,853 --> 00:25:22,607
- I'm invisible! Can't you see that?
- I can only see footsteps.

227
00:25:23,493 --> 00:25:26,883
The gods are truly remarkable.

228
00:25:28,173 --> 00:25:30,243
Perseus...

229
00:25:30,773 --> 00:25:32,331
...where are you going?

230
00:25:32,493 --> 00:25:33,608
To Joppa!

231
00:25:34,893 --> 00:25:36,645
Your sword!

232
00:25:36,813 --> 00:25:40,010
Oh, impetuous...

233
00:25:40,213 --> 00:25:42,169
...foolish...

234
00:25:42,373 --> 00:25:46,491
Ah, dear, the young.

235
00:25:47,693 --> 00:25:50,412
Why do they never listen?

236
00:25:51,293 --> 00:25:54,126
When will they ever learn?

237
00:27:18,213 --> 00:27:19,328
A stranger here?

238
00:27:19,533 --> 00:27:22,411
A stranger to sights like these.

239
00:27:22,613 --> 00:27:25,207
- Was he a criminal?
- No.

240
00:27:25,413 --> 00:27:28,086
He was a suitor
for the Princess Andromeda.

241
00:27:28,253 --> 00:27:32,804
That woman over there is her mother,
Queen Cassiopeia.

242
00:27:33,053 --> 00:27:35,487
A royal suitor? Burned?

243
00:27:35,893 --> 00:27:38,248
A suitor, yes, but not royal.

244
00:27:39,173 --> 00:27:43,610
- I don't understand.
- These are strange times, my friend.

245
00:27:44,933 --> 00:27:48,005
Andromeda was destined
to marry Prince Calibos.

246
00:27:48,173 --> 00:27:52,132
Then he was struck down, deformed,
punished by the gods.

247
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:56,690
Andromeda refused to marry him.
The priests prayed, read the signs...

248
00:27:56,893 --> 00:27:59,805
...and declared that Thetis was angry.

249
00:28:00,013 --> 00:28:04,165
Since then, any man may present
himself as a suitor.

250
00:28:04,653 --> 00:28:09,568
- I wonder that any man would even try.
- Andromeda is very beautiful.

251
00:28:09,773 --> 00:28:13,732
Besides, whoever marries her
will rule the entire kingdom.

252
00:28:13,933 --> 00:28:16,163
For that, men are willing to die.

253
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:19,531
- They have only to solve a riddle.
- A riddle?

254
00:28:19,733 --> 00:28:23,203
- Is that all?
- The riddle changes for each suitor.

255
00:28:24,133 --> 00:28:25,930
And those who fail...

256
00:28:26,573 --> 00:28:29,212
...do not tell what they were asked.

257
00:28:29,413 --> 00:28:31,563
And this Calibos...

258
00:28:32,373 --> 00:28:35,251
...what of him?
- We live in fear of him.

259
00:28:35,453 --> 00:28:38,923
Fear of what he may do in vengeance
against Andromeda.

260
00:28:39,213 --> 00:28:41,773
- Where is she?
- In the highest tower...

261
00:28:41,973 --> 00:28:45,170
...above this smoke and stench.

262
00:28:45,413 --> 00:28:48,928
She will not speak or eat
in protest of this ritual.

263
00:28:49,093 --> 00:28:53,928
She remains alone, away from these
accursed, hell-sent swarms...

264
00:28:54,133 --> 00:28:57,045
...of blood-gutted marsh flies.

265
00:28:57,453 --> 00:28:59,523
Thank you, friend.

266
00:32:40,453 --> 00:32:41,602
Andromeda.

267
00:32:44,453 --> 00:32:47,331
I've found my destiny.

268
00:33:05,453 --> 00:33:07,409
Calibos.

269
00:33:10,053 --> 00:33:12,613
The vulture flew toward the east.

270
00:33:12,813 --> 00:33:17,841
Toward the swamps! Toward the lair
of the Lord of the Marsh.

271
00:33:18,053 --> 00:33:21,250
We must find a way to follow the bird.

272
00:33:21,453 --> 00:33:26,049
If and when it appears
to the princess again.

273
00:33:27,253 --> 00:33:29,050
Yes.

274
00:33:29,653 --> 00:33:34,727
But how are we going to follow
a creature that flies through the air?

275
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:40,603
There just might be a chance,
you see.

276
00:33:41,453 --> 00:33:45,002
Remote, I grant you.

277
00:33:45,213 --> 00:33:47,204
Tonight!

278
00:34:00,293 --> 00:34:03,569
When the full moon shines
on the water, they say...

279
00:34:03,773 --> 00:34:08,528
...Pegasus, the last of the winged
horses, comes to drink.

280
00:34:08,733 --> 00:34:10,212
Listen!

281
00:34:11,573 --> 00:34:12,642
Look there!

282
00:34:13,133 --> 00:34:15,693
- I see nothing.
- Over there!

283
00:34:20,413 --> 00:34:22,404
Pegasus!

284
00:35:35,973 --> 00:35:38,692
Tha?s it, tha?s it. Easy, easy.

285
00:35:46,613 --> 00:35:48,808
Whoa, easy.

286
00:35:48,973 --> 00:35:50,611
Easy!

287
00:36:03,813 --> 00:36:04,802
Tha?s it.

288
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:19,483
Steady, steady.

289
00:38:03,653 --> 00:38:06,850
Tha?s it, tha?s it, tha?s it!

290
00:38:07,053 --> 00:38:08,850
Good boy, good boy.

291
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:24,325
The most beautiful stallion
in the world. But thirsty.

292
00:38:24,493 --> 00:38:28,884
I'm not surprised.
I could do with something myself.

293
00:38:29,093 --> 00:38:32,165
Here. Stay with him.

294
00:38:32,373 --> 00:38:33,886
Pegasus.

295
00:38:34,093 --> 00:38:36,368
You're beautiful. Now don't you fret.

296
00:38:36,573 --> 00:38:39,690
Your friend will be back in a moment.

297
00:38:40,533 --> 00:38:44,162
- Slow, slow.
- Pegasus.

298
00:38:47,813 --> 00:38:52,728
- We did it!
- No, you did it. You did it!

299
00:41:51,533 --> 00:41:54,684
A gift for you.

300
00:42:22,453 --> 00:42:25,763
Calibos, why have you summoned
me here again?

301
00:42:26,173 --> 00:42:29,882
Because if I cannot look upon
your true beauty...

302
00:42:30,373 --> 00:42:35,288
...I can see its mirror,
and remember how you once...

303
00:42:35,493 --> 00:42:37,051
...Ioved me.

304
00:42:38,733 --> 00:42:40,644
Remember me how I was.

305
00:42:41,013 --> 00:42:45,086
I remember, but now...

306
00:42:45,453 --> 00:42:49,731
Then it is time for you to learn a new
mystery, a new question!

307
00:42:49,973 --> 00:42:54,728
No, I beg you. No more bonfires.

308
00:43:04,053 --> 00:43:08,524
Mark well, Andromeda.
A new question...

309
00:43:08,733 --> 00:43:12,328
...for a would-be hero.

310
00:43:18,733 --> 00:43:22,567
Mark, and remember.

311
00:43:35,653 --> 00:43:38,213
When the time comes...

312
00:43:38,413 --> 00:43:42,201
...when the next suitor
presents himself...

313
00:43:42,413 --> 00:43:45,723
...you will remember.

314
00:43:46,893 --> 00:43:50,363
Calibos, I implore you...

315
00:43:50,573 --> 00:43:53,929
...lift your curse from Joppa
and release my soul.

316
00:43:54,533 --> 00:43:56,444
Show pity, Calibos.

317
00:43:57,413 --> 00:43:59,973
As you loved me once...

318
00:44:00,933 --> 00:44:03,731
...be merciful now.

319
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:19,444
Go.

320
00:45:13,973 --> 00:45:15,486
Pegasus!

321
00:45:20,253 --> 00:45:21,766
Pegasus!

322
00:45:36,173 --> 00:45:37,367
Pegasus!

323
00:46:45,133 --> 00:46:49,763
Once again I, Cassiopeia, the queen...

324
00:46:50,093 --> 00:46:53,130
...present to you my daughter,
Andromeda.

325
00:46:53,813 --> 00:46:59,046
If there is any man here worthy
to seek her hand in marriage...

326
00:46:59,213 --> 00:47:02,728
...let him make himself known!

327
00:47:05,133 --> 00:47:07,283
Is there no one?

328
00:47:07,493 --> 00:47:12,044
No man worthy in my whole
wide kingdom of Phoenicia?

329
00:47:12,253 --> 00:47:16,007
No man of courage in the whole world?

330
00:47:35,146 --> 00:47:36,499
Who are you?

331
00:47:36,666 --> 00:47:41,456
Perseus, prince and heir
to the kingdom of Argos.

332
00:47:50,306 --> 00:47:51,978
You!

333
00:47:52,826 --> 00:47:54,418
You know him?

334
00:47:56,346 --> 00:47:57,859
Only...

335
00:47:58,706 --> 00:48:01,174
...from a dream.

336
00:48:01,786 --> 00:48:05,142
I beg you, abandon me.

337
00:48:05,306 --> 00:48:07,695
Ask your riddle.

338
00:48:12,906 --> 00:48:15,056
In my minïs eyes I <i>see...</i>

339
00:48:15,306 --> 00:48:20,175
...three circles joined in priceless,
graceful harmony.

340
00:48:20,346 --> 00:48:24,385
Two full as the moon.
One hollow as a crown.

341
00:48:24,866 --> 00:48:28,176
Two from the sea, five fathoms down.

342
00:48:28,826 --> 00:48:32,182
One from the earth,
deep under the ground.

343
00:48:32,386 --> 00:48:35,822
The whole, a mark of high renown.

344
00:48:36,026 --> 00:48:40,144
Tell me, what can it be?

345
00:48:42,386 --> 00:48:45,139
Have courage, princess.

346
00:48:45,346 --> 00:48:47,143
What can it be?

347
00:48:47,346 --> 00:48:49,337
Three circles joined.

348
00:48:49,626 --> 00:48:52,299
Two moons and a crown.

349
00:48:52,986 --> 00:48:56,695
- Tell me!
- The answer is a ring!

350
00:48:57,186 --> 00:48:59,541
Two pearls in a circle of gold!

351
00:49:00,026 --> 00:49:04,497
The ring of the Lord of the Marsh.
The pearl ring of Calibos.

352
00:49:04,706 --> 00:49:09,700
Here, on the claw hand
of Calibos himself!

353
00:49:09,906 --> 00:49:13,615
The ring. A gift from his mother...

354
00:49:13,786 --> 00:49:15,742
...the goddess Thetis.

355
00:49:15,946 --> 00:49:18,176
Is that the answer?

356
00:49:18,586 --> 00:49:22,181
Is that the answer? Tell me!

357
00:49:22,386 --> 00:49:24,217
Yes.

358
00:49:26,786 --> 00:49:31,655
We fought in the swamp!
I spared his life on one condition.

359
00:49:32,946 --> 00:49:35,585
That he renounce his curse.

360
00:49:36,346 --> 00:49:38,621
There will be no more bonfires.

361
00:49:38,946 --> 00:49:41,506
No more nightmares.

362
00:49:42,026 --> 00:49:45,143
Light has conquered darkness.

363
00:49:45,466 --> 00:49:47,536
You're free.

364
00:50:21,106 --> 00:50:25,224
Thetis, divine goddess of the sea.

365
00:50:25,426 --> 00:50:28,259
Hear the prayer of your son Calibos.

366
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:31,017
Show me the way to justice.

367
00:50:32,066 --> 00:50:36,457
Show me how to punish Perseus
for this blasphemy!

368
00:50:38,746 --> 00:50:40,976
Look on this!

369
00:50:41,146 --> 00:50:42,625
In wounding me...

370
00:50:42,826 --> 00:50:45,465
...he has insulted you!

371
00:50:45,666 --> 00:50:49,739
Then surely he must be punished.

372
00:50:50,186 --> 00:50:52,097
Show me.

373
00:50:52,506 --> 00:50:54,736
Help me.

374
00:50:58,266 --> 00:51:01,781
<i>Perseus is protected by Zeus himself.</i>

375
00:51:02,146 --> 00:51:03,704
<i>There is nothing I can do.</i>

376
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:06,746
Then punish those that Perseus loves!

377
00:51:07,666 --> 00:51:10,100
The queen, Andromeda...

378
00:51:10,266 --> 00:51:12,382
...the people of Joppa!

379
00:51:12,826 --> 00:51:15,977
Persuade your devoted Lord Poseidon...

380
00:51:16,346 --> 00:51:18,814
...to let loose the Kraken
on the city.

381
00:51:19,026 --> 00:51:21,494
Let the Kraken destroy Joppa...

382
00:51:21,906 --> 00:51:25,535
...as it destroyed Argos!

383
00:51:25,746 --> 00:51:28,180
I demand justice!

384
00:51:28,666 --> 00:51:32,739
<i>Justice, or revenge?</i>

385
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:47,855
- Did you love Calibos?
- Before he was punished?

386
00:51:48,786 --> 00:51:51,619
No, it was never love.

387
00:51:51,826 --> 00:51:55,785
He was handsome and fascinating.
I was very young.

388
00:51:55,986 --> 00:52:00,901
- And now?
- Now I feel pity for him.

389
00:52:01,706 --> 00:52:05,494
When you fought in the swamp,
why didn't you kill him?

390
00:52:08,026 --> 00:52:11,735
Perhaps because I too felt pity.

391
00:52:11,946 --> 00:52:14,062
I still don't understand.

392
00:52:14,266 --> 00:52:18,862
We met today and yet you say
you've loved me for much longer.

393
00:52:19,786 --> 00:52:24,655
I did see you once. I saw you asleep.

394
00:52:24,986 --> 00:52:28,023
- From then on I was hopelessly lost.
- Asleep?

395
00:52:28,346 --> 00:52:31,144
Just believe me when I say...

396
00:52:31,346 --> 00:52:33,985
...that I did see you.

397
00:52:34,186 --> 00:52:38,259
And the sight of you passed
straight through me like an arrow.

398
00:52:38,946 --> 00:52:41,858
It astonished me.

399
00:52:42,066 --> 00:52:46,105
From that moment, I knew
that I would do anything for you.

400
00:52:46,546 --> 00:52:49,140
From that moment...

401
00:52:49,306 --> 00:52:51,820
...I knew that I loved you.

402
00:53:08,186 --> 00:53:11,781
As I bind their hands
with this silken thread...

403
00:53:12,346 --> 00:53:15,861
...bear witness that as she
is my heiress...

404
00:53:16,426 --> 00:53:19,702
...so Perseus becomes my heir.

405
00:53:19,866 --> 00:53:21,618
As she is my daughter...

406
00:53:21,786 --> 00:53:26,496
...so Perseus becomes my son.

407
00:53:30,466 --> 00:53:35,699
I give her to the man
who has saved us from despair.

408
00:53:36,026 --> 00:53:38,256
I give Andromeda...

409
00:53:38,466 --> 00:53:41,583
...the most beautiful of all prizes...

410
00:53:41,786 --> 00:53:45,062
...more beautiful
than anything on earth...

411
00:53:45,266 --> 00:53:48,338
...or in heaven. Even more lovely...

412
00:53:48,546 --> 00:53:51,856
...than the goddess Thetis herself.

413
00:54:20,706 --> 00:54:23,379
<i>Hear me, vain and foolish</i>
<i>mortal woman.</i>

414
00:54:23,706 --> 00:54:28,143
<i>You dare compare your daughter's</i>
<i>beauty to mine in my own sanctuary?</i>

415
00:54:28,546 --> 00:54:31,743
<i>You will repent your boast</i>
<i>and the cruel injury...</i>

416
00:54:31,946 --> 00:54:34,779
<i>... you have inflicted</i>
<i>on my son Calibos.</i>

417
00:54:34,986 --> 00:54:38,535
Forgive! Forgive...

418
00:54:38,786 --> 00:54:42,665
<i>In 30 days, on the eve</i>
<i>of the longest day of the year...</i>

419
00:54:42,866 --> 00:54:47,382
<i>... Andromeda must be taken to</i>
<i>the Sacrificial Rock by the sea...</i>

420
00:54:47,546 --> 00:54:50,504
<i>... there bound and chained</i>
<i>to the stone...</i>

421
00:54:50,706 --> 00:54:54,255
<i>... she must be unknown to man,</i>
<i>a virgin.</i>

422
00:54:54,906 --> 00:54:57,625
<i>A sacrifice suitable for the Kraken.</i>

423
00:54:57,946 --> 00:55:00,938
<i>She must be delivered to the Kraken</i>
<i>at sunset...</i>

424
00:55:01,146 --> 00:55:05,424
<i>... or else the Kraken will destroy</i>
<i>Joppa and everyone within the city.</i>

425
00:55:05,626 --> 00:55:09,414
<i>For the insult to me</i>
<i>and the injury inflicted on my son...</i>

426
00:55:09,626 --> 00:55:13,062
<i>... I demand the life of Andromeda.</i>

427
00:55:13,466 --> 00:55:16,424
<i>In 30 days.</i>

428
00:55:42,746 --> 00:55:45,306
There must be a way
to kill the Kraken.

429
00:55:45,466 --> 00:55:47,218
No.

430
00:55:47,386 --> 00:55:49,980
No way known to man.

431
00:55:50,186 --> 00:55:53,144
- You claim to be an optimist.
- Yes, I am.

432
00:55:53,306 --> 00:55:56,378
I believe that man can
overcome most obstacles.

433
00:55:56,586 --> 00:56:00,261
I've had enough of your philosophy.
It's time for action!

434
00:56:00,466 --> 00:56:02,900
Now wait one moment.

435
00:56:03,066 --> 00:56:06,103
I said there was no way known to man.

436
00:56:06,306 --> 00:56:10,458
There might be a way known to woman.

437
00:56:12,986 --> 00:56:14,977
To woman?

438
00:56:15,186 --> 00:56:16,858
Three women.

439
00:56:17,066 --> 00:56:19,375
Three old, blind women...

440
00:56:20,066 --> 00:56:22,978
...gifted in prophecy and knowledge.

441
00:56:23,186 --> 00:56:27,338
They are wise, these old women!
Wise as they are ancient.

442
00:56:27,546 --> 00:56:30,106
- Who are they?
- The Stygian Witches.

443
00:56:30,346 --> 00:56:34,259
They live far away, beyond the desert
frontiers of Joppa...

444
00:56:34,466 --> 00:56:38,425
...in the mountains of the North.
- Even if you find them...

445
00:56:38,786 --> 00:56:42,574
...even if they show you a way
to defeat the Kraken...

446
00:56:42,746 --> 00:56:45,783
...you may not live
to exploit their advice.

447
00:56:46,066 --> 00:56:50,059
- Why not?
- They have a craving for human flesh.

448
00:56:50,506 --> 00:56:53,623
When the plague of Calibos
infested the city...

449
00:56:53,786 --> 00:56:59,065
...the queen sent ambassadors to visit
the blind witches. None ever returned.

450
00:56:59,266 --> 00:57:02,019
Their shrine lies many days' journey
from here.

451
00:57:02,626 --> 00:57:05,777
We have only 30 days left to us.

452
00:57:05,986 --> 00:57:08,102
But we have...

453
00:57:08,906 --> 00:57:11,101
We have a flying horse.

454
00:57:11,306 --> 00:57:13,615
Three days will take three hours.

455
00:57:13,866 --> 00:57:18,462
Take me with you! If only to the Wells
of the Moon. Just to be with you.

456
00:58:56,706 --> 00:58:59,539
- We've searched the lakeshore.
- No sign?

457
00:58:59,746 --> 00:59:03,819
A few hoofprints by the water's edge,
but no tracks to follow.

458
00:59:04,306 --> 00:59:08,743
We cannot wait for Pegasus.
I'll search for the witches.

459
00:59:08,946 --> 00:59:12,734
No. We will ride with you
as far as their shrine.

460
00:59:12,946 --> 00:59:14,664
It is a perilous journey.

461
00:59:14,866 --> 00:59:19,382
- Too perilous for a princess.
- You are not yet my lord and husband.

462
00:59:20,346 --> 00:59:23,258
In the queen's absence,
it is I who command.

463
00:59:23,466 --> 00:59:25,138
- Herald?
- Your Highness.

464
00:59:25,306 --> 00:59:30,221
Inform the queen we are riding
as escort to Prince Perseus.

465
00:59:34,106 --> 00:59:36,176
We follow the North Star.

466
00:59:54,866 --> 00:59:56,822
Perseus is moving into danger.

467
00:59:57,106 --> 01:00:01,622
He will find the Kraken somewhat
more formidable than Calibos.

468
01:00:02,866 --> 01:00:05,824
- Your helmet is gone?
- Deep in a swamp.

469
01:00:06,026 --> 01:00:09,063
- Lost forever.
- Replace it with some other gift.

470
01:00:09,266 --> 01:00:14,260
- But what?
- Your friend. Bubo, the owl.

471
01:00:14,906 --> 01:00:18,899
Give Perseus your owl.
It is all-knowing, all-seeing.

472
01:00:19,306 --> 01:00:23,538
Give it to him. It is my wish.

473
01:00:26,586 --> 01:00:30,374
- My command.
- Never!

474
01:00:38,266 --> 01:00:40,177
Hephaestus will do what he can.

475
01:00:40,786 --> 01:00:43,903
Brass and iron
are no substitute for feathers...

476
01:00:44,106 --> 01:00:47,496
...but he's very skilled
and ingenious.

477
01:00:47,946 --> 01:00:52,781
Let great Zeus rage
till even Olympus shakes.

478
01:00:52,986 --> 01:00:57,298
But I will never part with you,
my beloved Bubo.

479
01:01:40,466 --> 01:01:43,822
Nothing. Nothing.

480
01:01:45,906 --> 01:01:49,262
- We could be lost for days in this.
- Look!

481
01:01:57,466 --> 01:01:59,582
It's heading this way!

482
01:02:01,546 --> 01:02:03,616
It's flying straight for us.

483
01:02:07,346 --> 01:02:11,021
Is it a hawk? Is it going to attack?

484
01:02:14,346 --> 01:02:17,816
By the gods! An owl!

485
01:02:18,026 --> 01:02:20,665
A golden owl!

486
01:02:43,266 --> 01:02:46,144
Too heavy for the dead branch, eh?

487
01:02:47,066 --> 01:02:48,579
How do you know that?

488
01:02:49,146 --> 01:02:52,024
- He told me.
- Told you?

489
01:02:56,026 --> 01:03:00,702
- His name is Bubo.
- Do you understand all those noises?

490
01:03:00,906 --> 01:03:02,737
Perfectly clear to me.

491
01:03:02,906 --> 01:03:08,060
It's another gift from the gods.
Like the sword and the helmet.

492
01:03:09,866 --> 01:03:11,697
He can lead us to the shrine.

493
01:03:38,466 --> 01:03:40,058
Come on!

494
01:06:41,586 --> 01:06:45,465
Don't worry, my little friend.
Thallo will take you.

495
01:06:56,226 --> 01:06:58,581
Someone coming.

496
01:06:58,786 --> 01:07:02,745
Sounds like a man. A young man.

497
01:07:02,906 --> 01:07:04,305
- Who has the eye?
- I do!

498
01:07:04,506 --> 01:07:08,385
- Then give it to me.
- No! I want to be the first to see him.

499
01:07:08,866 --> 01:07:11,426
What do you see, sister?
What do you see?

500
01:07:11,666 --> 01:07:16,296
Yes! A young man, not plump
but well-made.

501
01:07:16,506 --> 01:07:20,055
Have no fear. I come in peace.

502
01:07:21,586 --> 01:07:26,979
Come a little closer so that we
can get a better look at you.

503
01:07:27,826 --> 01:07:31,739
- We are honored by your visit.
- What can we do to help you?

504
01:07:33,666 --> 01:07:37,102
- I need your advice.
- Then you must come a little closer.

505
01:07:37,466 --> 01:07:40,583
You see, my two sisters here
are somewhat deaf.

506
01:07:40,746 --> 01:07:44,421
- I still can't hear him.
- Suppose we were to move...

507
01:07:44,586 --> 01:07:46,816
...a little closer to him.

508
01:08:05,426 --> 01:08:06,939
Now!

509
01:08:07,546 --> 01:08:11,255
- Noise, What's that noise?
- What, what? Where is it?

510
01:08:11,786 --> 01:08:15,495
Bubo! The eye! Go for the eye!

511
01:08:15,706 --> 01:08:17,617
- Where is it?
- What is it?

512
01:08:19,706 --> 01:08:22,778
- What's wrong?
- It's gone! It's got the eye! The eye!

513
01:08:23,066 --> 01:08:27,423
- Don't drop the eye!
- Oh, no! Where's the eye?

514
01:08:27,626 --> 01:08:30,902
- You have it!
- Never fear. It is safe.

515
01:08:31,186 --> 01:08:33,256
Give it to us. Give it back.

516
01:08:33,466 --> 01:08:35,218
- On one condition.
- Anything!

517
01:08:35,386 --> 01:08:37,900
- We must have it now!
- You will have it.

518
01:08:38,106 --> 01:08:40,825
- After you answer my question.
- Ask, then.

519
01:08:42,546 --> 01:08:48,178
How may a mortal man
face and defeat the Kraken?

520
01:08:48,346 --> 01:08:52,225
The Kraken is invulnerable.
100 men could not fight him.

521
01:08:52,386 --> 01:08:54,342
An army could not kill him.

522
01:08:54,786 --> 01:08:58,540
Nothing is invulnerable.
There must be a way.

523
01:08:58,746 --> 01:09:02,625
Perhaps, one way.

524
01:09:02,946 --> 01:09:06,655
But a way even more dangerous
than the Kraken itself.

525
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:10,423
- Tell me.
- Give me the eye and I'll tell you.

526
01:09:11,026 --> 01:09:12,937
First, tell me.

527
01:09:13,266 --> 01:09:15,860
The head of Medusa. The Gorgon!

528
01:09:16,106 --> 01:09:21,339
One look from the head of Medusa
can turn all creatures into stone.

529
01:09:21,826 --> 01:09:26,695
- No matter how huge and powerful.
- And her blood is a deadly venom.

530
01:09:26,906 --> 01:09:29,420
A Titan against a Titan!

531
01:09:29,626 --> 01:09:33,699
- You must win Medusa's head.
- She's not going to give it to you.

532
01:09:33,866 --> 01:09:36,426
- As a present.
- As difficult and dangerous...

533
01:09:36,626 --> 01:09:41,256
...as to vanquish 1000 Krakens.
- Your only chance against the Kraken.

534
01:09:41,426 --> 01:09:44,702
Give us the eye.
We have answered your question.

535
01:09:44,906 --> 01:09:48,376
One more question.
If the eyes of Medusa...

536
01:09:48,586 --> 01:09:52,704
...even after her death can turn
all living creatures into stone...

537
01:09:52,866 --> 01:09:57,417
...what about the blood?
- Deadly and poisonous.

538
01:09:57,626 --> 01:10:02,541
But you have touched the eye.
As it has the power to give sight...

539
01:10:02,746 --> 01:10:08,218
...so it can make your red cloak
proof against the blood.

540
01:10:08,626 --> 01:10:13,825
The eye is all powerful. We can
tell you no more. Give us the eye.

541
01:10:13,986 --> 01:10:16,739
- You have told me the truth?
- We swear it.

542
01:10:16,946 --> 01:10:22,498
- The rest is for you. Seek Medusa.
- On the Isle of the Dead.

543
01:10:22,706 --> 01:10:27,860
- At the very edge of the underworld.
- Give us back the eye!

544
01:10:28,066 --> 01:10:32,856
- Give us the eye! We must have it!
- Here, catch.

545
01:10:34,786 --> 01:10:38,620
- Where is it? I want it!
- It's my turn!

546
01:10:39,506 --> 01:10:41,497
Where'd it go?
Give it to me!

547
01:10:41,706 --> 01:10:43,025
One of you has it!

548
01:10:45,186 --> 01:10:47,746
The sands of time
run like quicksilver.

549
01:10:48,386 --> 01:10:53,176
We'll be across these mountains
tomorrow, near the Isle of the Dead.

550
01:10:54,306 --> 01:10:56,024
And then, Medusa.

551
01:10:57,186 --> 01:10:59,859
I wrote a play about her long ago.

552
01:11:00,066 --> 01:11:03,741
I was partial to tragedy in my youth.

553
01:11:03,946 --> 01:11:08,656
Before experience taught me
that life is quite tragic enough...

554
01:11:08,866 --> 01:11:12,063
...without my writing about it.
- Medusa.

555
01:11:13,826 --> 01:11:18,138
- She was priestess to Aphrodite.
- Yes, and a most beautiful woman...

556
01:11:18,346 --> 01:11:20,223
...by all accounts.

557
01:11:21,506 --> 01:11:27,581
She was seduced by Poseidon. They
made love in the temple of Aphrodite.

558
01:11:28,186 --> 01:11:33,055
And that goddess was so jealous
that she punished Medusa.

559
01:11:33,266 --> 01:11:38,898
She transformed her into
an apparition so horrible...

560
01:11:39,106 --> 01:11:44,100
...that one look from her
will turn any living creature...

561
01:11:44,306 --> 01:11:45,898
...into stone.

562
01:11:59,106 --> 01:12:01,666
I'm so afraid for you.

563
01:12:01,866 --> 01:12:04,699
It must be done.
We've no other choice.

564
01:12:04,906 --> 01:12:08,945
- Tomorrow you return to the city.
- No, I'm coming with you.

565
01:12:09,146 --> 01:12:12,695
Then sleep now. We ride at dawn.

566
01:12:14,546 --> 01:12:19,256
So little time together.
So little time.

567
01:12:21,866 --> 01:12:26,337
Sleep now. Sleep.

568
01:13:51,346 --> 01:13:52,825
The river Styx.

569
01:13:53,346 --> 01:13:55,177
The River of Death...

570
01:13:55,386 --> 01:13:57,138
...has strange powers.

571
01:13:58,026 --> 01:13:59,584
So I've heard.

572
01:14:02,066 --> 01:14:04,705
Time to see if the legend is true.

573
01:14:06,146 --> 01:14:08,341
Here. You'll need this.

574
01:14:09,666 --> 01:14:12,863
For Charon. The ferryman.

575
01:17:43,706 --> 01:17:48,336
Remember, one look from her
is enough.

576
01:17:48,546 --> 01:17:53,222
If you must see her, use the inside
of your shield as a mirror.

577
01:17:53,426 --> 01:17:56,577
Her reflection cannot harm you.

578
01:17:56,786 --> 01:17:59,744
Never look her in the face.

579
01:21:21,626 --> 01:21:24,220
Remember, now It's three against one.

580
01:25:41,706 --> 01:25:45,585
<i>Guard well the shield.</i>

581
01:25:45,786 --> 01:25:50,462
<i>For one day, it will guard your life.</i>

582
01:29:08,986 --> 01:29:13,343
<i>Find and fulfill your destiny.</i>

583
01:34:02,146 --> 01:34:03,420
Thallo!

584
01:35:31,666 --> 01:35:34,100
Hello, my wet friend.

585
01:35:34,306 --> 01:35:36,024
No.

586
01:35:37,106 --> 01:35:39,256
No, our task is not complete.

587
01:35:42,586 --> 01:35:44,497
If you can fly...

588
01:35:52,266 --> 01:35:53,460
Good.

589
01:35:55,426 --> 01:35:58,020
And if he's still <i>alive...</i>

590
01:35:58,226 --> 01:36:02,219
...you must try to find Pegasus.

591
01:39:05,666 --> 01:39:09,659
Great Zeus, below on Earth
it is now the eve...

592
01:39:09,866 --> 01:39:13,256
...of the longest day.

593
01:39:14,146 --> 01:39:15,784
Very well.

594
01:39:18,306 --> 01:39:19,785
Release the Kraken.

595
01:48:23,746 --> 01:48:26,340
Perseus has won.

596
01:48:26,546 --> 01:48:28,025
My son...

597
01:48:28,546 --> 01:48:30,059
...has triumphed.

598
01:48:30,306 --> 01:48:34,299
- A fortunate young man.
- Fortune is ally to the brave.

599
01:48:34,466 --> 01:48:36,616
<i>What a dangerous precedent.</i>

600
01:48:36,826 --> 01:48:39,260
<i>What if one day there were other</i>
<i>heroes like him?</i>

601
01:48:39,466 --> 01:48:44,176
What if courage and imagination
became everyday mortal qualities?

602
01:48:44,386 --> 01:48:46,422
We would no longer be needed.

603
01:48:46,626 --> 01:48:50,175
But for the moment, there is sufficient
cowardice, sloth...

604
01:48:50,386 --> 01:48:54,379
...and mendacity down there on Earth
to last forever.

605
01:48:54,586 --> 01:48:57,817
I forbid any revenge
against Perseus.

606
01:48:58,026 --> 01:49:00,699
He has done well.

607
01:49:01,786 --> 01:49:05,665
<i>He will be rewarded.</i>

608
01:49:15,266 --> 01:49:18,497
This will make a fine heroic poem,
you know.

609
01:49:18,706 --> 01:49:21,015
Or perhaps a play.

610
01:49:23,586 --> 01:49:27,374
Oh, don't worry.
I won't leave you out.

611
01:49:29,786 --> 01:49:33,620
<i>Perseus and Andromeda</i>
<i>will be happy together.</i>

612
01:49:33,826 --> 01:49:36,101
<i>Have fine sons...</i>

613
01:49:36,306 --> 01:49:38,866
<i>... rule wisely...</i>

614
01:49:39,066 --> 01:49:41,785
<i>... and to perpetuate</i>
<i>the story of his courage...</i>

615
01:49:41,986 --> 01:49:44,625
<i>... I command that from henceforth...</i>

616
01:49:44,826 --> 01:49:48,216
<i>... he will be set among the stars</i>
<i>and constellations.</i>

617
01:49:48,386 --> 01:49:53,221
<i>He, Perseus, the lovely Andromeda...</i>

618
01:49:53,426 --> 01:49:58,295
<i>... the noble Pegasus</i>
<i>and even the vain Cassiopeia.</i>

619
01:49:58,466 --> 01:50:02,664
<i>Let the stars be named</i>
<i>after them forever.</i>

620
01:50:02,866 --> 01:50:07,860
<i>As long as man shall walk the Earth</i>
<i>and search the night sky in wonder...</i>

621
01:50:08,066 --> 01:50:11,741
<i>... they will remember the courage</i>
<i>of Perseus...</i>

622
01:50:11,946 --> 01:50:13,743
<i>... forever.</i>

623
01:50:13,946 --> 01:50:18,417
<i>Even if we, the gods,</i>
<i>are abandoned or forgotten...</i>

624
01:50:18,626 --> 01:50:22,585
<i>... the stars will never fade.</i>

625
01:50:22,786 --> 01:50:24,424
<i>Never.</i>

626
01:50:24,626 --> 01:50:28,904
<i>They will burn till the end of time.</i>
