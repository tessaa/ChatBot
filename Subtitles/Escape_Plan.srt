1
00:01:12,342 --> 00:01:14,139
- Ray, you up?
- Yeah.

2
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:15,642
Jacks are gonna jump on you, tomorrow.

3
00:01:15,643 --> 00:01:18,001
Two bell.

4
00:01:20,861 --> 00:01:23,264
I figured, I owe you.

5
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:28,091
Yo..Did you hear what I said?

6
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,864
I heard.

7
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,060
Thanks.

8
00:01:55,758 --> 00:01:57,454
Prison guard: Everybody, down.
Now!

9
00:01:58,238 --> 00:01:59,329
On the ground!

10
00:01:59,978 --> 00:02:03,417
You, inmate. On the ground.

11
00:02:03,685 --> 00:02:04,303
Now!

12
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:07,436
- Get down.
- You heard us.

13
00:02:07,969 --> 00:02:09,852
On the fucking ground.

14
00:02:34,486 --> 00:02:35,803
You are up.

15
00:02:37,981 --> 00:02:39,179
To your left.

16
00:02:42,524 --> 00:02:44,127
On the line.

17
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:54,105
Step to the right.

18
00:03:14,996 --> 00:03:16,275
Hands?

19
00:03:21,633 --> 00:03:23,063
Enjoy.

20
00:04:30,974 --> 00:04:33,375
Let's go.

21
00:05:07,843 --> 00:05:10,159
Lunch time, inmate.
Eat your vegetables.

22
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,739
Ready to go.

23
00:05:20,932 --> 00:05:22,268
Hey, Roag?

24
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,444
- Yeah?
- You got the time?

25
00:05:26,636 --> 00:05:28,535
What the fuck do you care?
You got a date?

26
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:29,690
No.

27
00:05:29,882 --> 00:05:31,936
Maybe, you've got a sister or cousin.

28
00:05:33,681 --> 00:05:35,311
You got your head smashed?

29
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:36,465
No, I'm groovy.

30
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:40,378
It's 5:04.

31
00:05:42,337 --> 00:05:44,238
Wise ass!

32
00:05:49,684 --> 00:05:52,087
Hey, fruit cake? Let's go.

33
00:06:00,547 --> 00:06:05,229
Eight..nine..

34
00:06:05,329 --> 00:06:07,732
Ten.

35
00:06:13,193 --> 00:06:15,215
290.

36
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:16,028
291.

37
00:06:16,029 --> 00:06:18,431
292.

38
00:06:18,432 --> 00:06:20,834
293.

39
00:06:20,835 --> 00:06:22,892
294.

40
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:29,013
295..296...297298.

41
00:06:29,205 --> 00:06:30,165
299..

42
00:06:31,293 --> 00:06:32,993
300.

43
00:06:48,894 --> 00:06:49,937
You okay?

44
00:06:50,235 --> 00:06:52,754
I got everybody.
I got everybody.

45
00:06:55,975 --> 00:06:57,895
- What the fuck is going on?
- We got fire at B2.

46
00:06:58,054 --> 00:07:01,139
- All prisoners, back to their cell.
- Copy that.

47
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:06,677
What the fuck?

48
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:07,873
We got a runner. I repeat..

49
00:07:07,874 --> 00:07:09,143
Prisoner is Ray.

50
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,117
Nice ride.

51
00:07:35,309 --> 00:07:35,868
Hushe's idea.

52
00:07:36,506 --> 00:07:37,769
That's right.

53
00:07:38,168 --> 00:07:39,292
How's this side, Boss man.

54
00:07:39,516 --> 00:07:41,685
This side's great.
I warden was about you.

55
00:07:43,227 --> 00:07:44,777
You know, If you wasn't out soon.
I would've break in,

56
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,091
that motherfucker pulling your ass out.

57
00:07:46,315 --> 00:07:48,715
The only ex-con I know,
who gets out and wants to go back in.

58
00:07:49,382 --> 00:07:50,647
I didn't say, wants.

59
00:07:50,827 --> 00:07:51,723
I said, I would.

60
00:07:52,098 --> 00:07:54,207
There's a difference.

61
00:08:15,571 --> 00:08:16,851
Don't spend it all on one place.

62
00:08:28,732 --> 00:08:31,155
We have an escape from
Bendwater Penitentiary.

63
00:08:46,663 --> 00:08:48,703
Step out from the booth,
with your hands in the air!

64
00:08:48,835 --> 00:08:49,796
Show time.

65
00:08:53,569 --> 00:08:55,179
Put your hands in the air, now.

66
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:56,613
Hands in the air.

67
00:08:57,742 --> 00:08:59,742
Put your hands behind your head,
lock your fingers.

68
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:00,868
Do not move.

69
00:09:02,683 --> 00:09:04,014
A beautiful day.

70
00:09:30,214 --> 00:09:32,789
- What the hell is going on her?
- Calm down, Warden.

71
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:33,942
I am Lester Clark.

72
00:09:34,927 --> 00:09:38,232
I am C.E.O of the CEE Security.

73
00:09:38,424 --> 00:09:39,424
You may have heard of us?

74
00:09:39,577 --> 00:09:40,538
No?

75
00:09:42,141 --> 00:09:45,639
Al right, well..we are an independent
security company.

76
00:09:45,831 --> 00:09:49,468
Hired by the
federal bureau prison.

77
00:09:49,884 --> 00:09:52,092
To test the integrity of their,

78
00:09:52,284 --> 00:09:56,012
maximum security, facilities.
Nation wide.

79
00:09:56,943 --> 00:10:00,084
This is Ray Breslin,
He is partner..and uh..

80
00:10:00,276 --> 00:10:02,800
Resident Houdini.

81
00:10:02,993 --> 00:10:03,954
Warden.

82
00:10:04,768 --> 00:10:08,806
Now, for the last seven years.
Ray has been inserted into every

83
00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:10,239
maximum incarceration facility.

84
00:10:10,896 --> 00:10:12,625
In the system.

85
00:10:12,626 --> 00:10:14,379
He is there to ensure that
each and every one of them is 100%

86
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,878
escape proof.

87
00:10:18,383 --> 00:10:22,397
And apparently, yours wasn't.

88
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:23,549
And he got out.

89
00:10:23,741 --> 00:10:24,702
Ta dah!

90
00:10:24,872 --> 00:10:27,187
Okay, fine.

91
00:10:30,578 --> 00:10:32,995
I suppose, you're gonna tell me
how you did it?

92
00:10:33,568 --> 00:10:36,202
You think he wants to know?
Doesn't seem like it.

93
00:10:39,175 --> 00:10:40,613
Ray, you are on.

94
00:10:40,893 --> 00:10:42,277
Warden, let's start from the top.

95
00:10:42,837 --> 00:10:45,239
Any break requires, three things.

96
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,644
Knowing the lay out,
Understanding the routine and

97
00:10:47,645 --> 00:10:50,046
help from outsiders the realm.

98
00:10:50,047 --> 00:10:52,449
If you know the lay out,
the weak side is obvious.

99
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,822
In Bendwaters case...
is the secure housing unit.

100
00:10:55,584 --> 00:11:00,006
With the government expenditure with
17 Million dollars, building the facility.

101
00:11:00,198 --> 00:11:01,159
State of the art.

102
00:11:02,398 --> 00:11:03,653
The only problem is...

103
00:11:04,216 --> 00:11:05,817
It's located next to
unsecure fire crash.

104
00:11:09,713 --> 00:11:12,011
First, I needed to get inside,

105
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,197
so, I made some enemies.

106
00:11:16,302 --> 00:11:18,475
Once inside, it was obvious
you are short staff.

107
00:11:18,797 --> 00:11:20,837
Federal guidelines recommend
two guards present when

108
00:11:21,523 --> 00:11:23,477
transferring high risk inmates.

109
00:11:23,668 --> 00:11:24,804
You only use, one.

110
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:27,420
Knowing the guard's routine
was the next step.

111
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:31,099
30 seconds into my rec. Time
my C.O took a smoke break.

112
00:11:31,292 --> 00:11:34,619
7 minutes of everyday
there were no eyes on me.

113
00:11:35,404 --> 00:11:36,491
Two, three..

114
00:11:38,374 --> 00:11:42,182
After I knew the routine.
All I had to do, was pick a date.

115
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:46,229
And arrange for a distraction
at the front gate at exactly 4pm.

116
00:11:46,422 --> 00:11:48,663
But still at this point,
you're locked inside a steel box

117
00:11:48,895 --> 00:11:50,949
to get out,
you had to have a key code.

118
00:11:51,766 --> 00:11:54,449
You very good chocolate milk.

119
00:11:56,489 --> 00:11:59,686
See, the carton container has
a thin layer of wax linen.

120
00:12:05,467 --> 00:12:09,775
Lay it over the keypad to impress
within the key, with four keys to impress.

121
00:12:20,943 --> 00:12:25,266
With the four keys, its just numbers
game to identify the correct sequence.

122
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:27,783
I just needed to get to the keypad.

123
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:48,671
After, I had to cover my tracks,

124
00:12:49,398 --> 00:12:51,003
I had one minute to
make to the fire response shift.

125
00:12:51,195 --> 00:12:52,973
Before the team did.

126
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:05,598
I know the guards were still on the roof,
doing what they do.

127
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:06,751
Which is wasting time.

128
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,469
Before you know it,
I am right where I wannabe be.

129
00:13:23,215 --> 00:13:25,810
Just in time, to catch my ride.

130
00:13:35,542 --> 00:13:37,528
And your men drove me
right off the grounds.

131
00:13:37,794 --> 00:13:38,715
You have any questions?

132
00:13:40,562 --> 00:13:45,077
Yeah, one.

133
00:13:45,482 --> 00:13:48,960
What kind of man would choose to spend
most of his life in prison?

134
00:13:49,667 --> 00:13:52,150
Don't take it personally, Warden.

135
00:13:53,616 --> 00:13:56,844
Over the years, Ray has broken out
of 14 like this institutions.

136
00:13:57,036 --> 00:14:00,941
Some people has a talent to paint.
Some, uh..to sing.

137
00:14:01,135 --> 00:14:02,095
Me? I sing.

138
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:06,945
Ray Breslin, He possesses a unique
set of skills. He is able break out..

139
00:14:07,645 --> 00:14:08,845
Of any prison designed by man.

140
00:14:10,191 --> 00:14:12,593
I take it, you have been good?

141
00:14:12,594 --> 00:14:14,996
Yeah. You?
You a good boy inside?

142
00:14:15,494 --> 00:14:18,339
Well, of course. Okay..

143
00:14:18,531 --> 00:14:20,205
How did that thing with that guy go?

144
00:14:20,398 --> 00:14:21,359
- What guy?
- What guy.

145
00:14:21,551 --> 00:14:23,911
When I was gone, you were
angry about that there's some guy.

146
00:14:24,058 --> 00:14:28,288
Some bozo?
Oh, yeah. That bozo ended before dessert.

147
00:14:29,671 --> 00:14:32,724
- That's his loss.
- Yeah, they are all losers.

148
00:14:33,445 --> 00:14:35,405
How many times have I told you that?

149
00:14:35,597 --> 00:14:38,298
You want to get something to eat,
while we get by?

150
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,890
Is there a problem?

151
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:45,971
You're a horrible cook.

152
00:14:46,164 --> 00:14:48,608
That's nice. Well...

153
00:14:48,802 --> 00:14:50,082
You can complain in the morning.

154
00:14:50,988 --> 00:14:51,488
Ouch!

155
00:15:00,422 --> 00:15:01,902
Good morning, sir.
How can I help you?

156
00:15:04,753 --> 00:15:07,753
Oh, Mr. Breslin.
I'm so sorry. I am Jules.

157
00:15:07,944 --> 00:15:08,905
That's okay.

158
00:15:09,098 --> 00:15:10,058
You're new here?

159
00:15:10,251 --> 00:15:12,503
No, Sir. I've been here 5 months.

160
00:15:12,695 --> 00:15:13,726
- 5 months?
- Yes, sir.

161
00:15:16,966 --> 00:15:19,704
What have you got for me?

162
00:15:19,896 --> 00:15:20,858
Check it out.

163
00:15:22,624 --> 00:15:25,027
That is good.

164
00:15:25,028 --> 00:15:27,430
Very smart.
Did you do this all by yourself?

165
00:15:27,431 --> 00:15:29,833
I'm impressed. Genius..

166
00:15:29,834 --> 00:15:32,752
You are smart but..

167
00:15:33,847 --> 00:15:36,836
Sorry. Not smart enough.

168
00:15:36,985 --> 00:15:39,102
Don't be bitter.

169
00:16:03,611 --> 00:16:04,597
Morning, guys. Abbey?

170
00:16:04,598 --> 00:16:05,989
Nice to meet you.

171
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:08,421
Your work is the gold standard in field.

172
00:16:08,422 --> 00:16:12,397
What you've accomplished is remarkable.

173
00:16:14,442 --> 00:16:15,694
(mimes)- remarkable.

174
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,528
Thank you,
and..you are here because?

175
00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:20,585
She is 'Agency', Ray. As in..

176
00:16:20,586 --> 00:16:22,588
Central Intelligence Agency.

177
00:16:22,619 --> 00:16:25,069
- You, a spy?
- Worse..I am a lawyer.

178
00:16:26,325 --> 00:16:27,778
Ray, hear her out.

179
00:16:28,286 --> 00:16:29,543
She's legit.

180
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,206
I called into Langley, myself.

181
00:16:32,553 --> 00:16:35,118
Fine, I'll just listen.
Go ahead.

182
00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:39,931
Mr. Breslin..after ending extra ordinary
renditions, the agency is looking

183
00:16:40,061 --> 00:16:43,101
for alternate situations for incarcerating
this sort of people who commit acts

184
00:16:43,113 --> 00:16:45,525
so despicable, they are best..
Well...

185
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:48,403
how can I put it.. Eliminated?

186
00:16:48,565 --> 00:16:49,826
'Disappeared'.

187
00:16:50,035 --> 00:16:51,775
We are currently testing a prototype

188
00:16:51,812 --> 00:16:54,182
to deal with people,
no government wants on their books.

189
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:55,936
But first and foremost..

190
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:59,576
The people financing this, need to
know these facilities are escape proof.

191
00:16:59,669 --> 00:17:02,054
Before, the whole systems go online,
globally.

192
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:05,629
Which is really saying is that, none of
this is officially sanctioned by anyone.

193
00:17:05,721 --> 00:17:09,459
Close. What I'm saying Ms. Rose..
Is that these facilities

194
00:17:09,552 --> 00:17:11,975
are privately funded and administered.

195
00:17:12,067 --> 00:17:14,032
So, the word 'official'
doesn't really apply.

196
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:17,343
So, if anything goes wrong, nothing comes
back to bite you people in the ass?

197
00:17:17,435 --> 00:17:18,495
Whoa, whoa..this is not

198
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:20,440
your concern. Hey! I owe him.

199
00:17:20,483 --> 00:17:22,118
I don't owe you.

200
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:25,935
My job is to make sure that
the united states is in safe hand.

201
00:17:26,027 --> 00:17:28,708
Al right, can we just cut the crap
and call it like it is?

202
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,639
These institutions are off the grid.
With no trials,

203
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:33,343
there's no convictions;
This people just disappears

204
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:35,768
and you want him,
to go in and test it?

205
00:17:36,439 --> 00:17:38,841
Maybe it's time for me to interject
to the conversation that

206
00:17:38,842 --> 00:17:42,148
they have offered,
double your standard fee.

207
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,480
That's five mils..Ray.
In advance.

208
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:45,439
So, you like this?

209
00:17:45,616 --> 00:17:48,159
Look.. I'm the numbers guy.
You are the artist, Ray.

210
00:17:48,374 --> 00:17:51,493
And from the financial stand point,
I like it. I like this very much.

211
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:54,637
Beyond the money, Mr. Breslin.

212
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:58,752
The people send to this place shouldn't
be allowed out into the real world.

213
00:17:59,029 --> 00:18:02,670
Everyone of them is potential
game changer. For the worst.

214
00:18:02,941 --> 00:18:04,940
Al right.

215
00:18:08,775 --> 00:18:10,697
- Guidelines?
- The usual full works.

216
00:18:10,698 --> 00:18:13,582
Alias, cover story..contacts.
Event number.

217
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:16,273
Well, the only difference is
to fully test the security

218
00:18:16,274 --> 00:18:19,079
of the system; It's essential that
non of you know

219
00:18:19,153 --> 00:18:20,967
the location of the incarceration.

220
00:18:21,572 --> 00:18:24,562
- Will that present a problem?
- Yes. Yes, it would.

221
00:18:34,015 --> 00:18:35,262
When do we start?

222
00:18:35,353 --> 00:18:36,571
You just did.

223
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:41,160
Your entered new identity..

224
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,794
Would be picked up from this location.

225
00:18:42,795 --> 00:18:45,903
By private contractors
24 hours from now.

226
00:19:04,371 --> 00:19:05,254
I don't like this.

227
00:19:05,347 --> 00:19:06,807
And, you don't like her.

228
00:19:06,952 --> 00:19:08,697
Man, don't flatter yourself.

229
00:19:08,884 --> 00:19:12,922
We are going against every
protocol and guidelines

230
00:19:13,045 --> 00:19:15,600
that you, yourself has insisted on
every single time that you go in.

231
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:17,474
- And, I don't like her.
- You're right.

232
00:19:17,637 --> 00:19:19,204
She doesn't like anything.

233
00:19:19,297 --> 00:19:21,097
Because she's ambitious and greedy.

234
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:23,568
You say that like its a bad thing.

235
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:26,104
Profile?

236
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,642
Okay. Name - Anthony Portos.
Born - Madrid.

237
00:19:29,643 --> 00:19:32,045
Mother died, when you're 13.

238
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:35,421
Raised by your father, in the U.S.

239
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,270
You're suspected of manufacturing
bombs that has been used

240
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:40,728
in dozen political bombings across
Europe and South America

241
00:19:40,751 --> 00:19:44,097
- for the last, 10 years.
- Contact on-site?

242
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:46,019
The Warden's name is Riordan Watch.

243
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:49,630
- Evacuation Code?
- 310275.

244
00:19:53,255 --> 00:19:55,658
- Al right, let's do it.
- Tagging.

245
00:19:55,659 --> 00:19:58,062
No, I don't need this. Really.

246
00:19:58,063 --> 00:19:59,419
Yeah, you do.
This is not Old school.

247
00:19:59,456 --> 00:20:01,096
You think, I'm gonna let you go in, cold?

248
00:20:01,186 --> 00:20:02,221
This gets old.

249
00:20:03,374 --> 00:20:06,388
- Man, you're fucked up.
- Try it sometime.

250
00:20:06,469 --> 00:20:09,510
Sounds good, boss man.
Any time you wanna retire, you know

251
00:20:09,569 --> 00:20:11,807
I've been taking notes.
I'm ready to step up.

252
00:20:11,899 --> 00:20:14,269
Where am I gonna find another techno thug
who's as good as you are here?

253
00:20:14,362 --> 00:20:16,741
- A freak of nature.
- Yeah, very rare.

254
00:20:19,278 --> 00:20:20,849
There you are baby,

255
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,449
transponder is good.

256
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,862
It's like having me around
in your shoulder.

257
00:20:26,054 --> 00:20:27,015
What else?

258
00:20:32,588 --> 00:20:35,300
Hey, don't forget to write us, alright?

259
00:21:40,261 --> 00:21:41,323
Shit.

260
00:22:33,249 --> 00:22:35,037
Time to sleep.

261
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,631
Prisoner, 17458.

262
00:25:24,229 --> 00:25:28,459
Portos..welcome.

263
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,929
To the international detainment, intake.

264
00:25:31,507 --> 00:25:34,006
I am Warden Hobbes.

265
00:25:34,688 --> 00:25:35,737
Where is Warden Marsh?

266
00:25:36,237 --> 00:25:39,072
There is no Warden Marsh.

267
00:25:44,291 --> 00:25:46,867
What am I, disoriented..excited?

268
00:25:47,435 --> 00:25:49,357
I guess, that must be it.

269
00:25:49,358 --> 00:25:51,247
And I didn't see a man killed on
a transport helicopter

270
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:52,887
thrown out of it, right?

271
00:25:59,018 --> 00:26:02,466
Mr. Portos, your intake is finished.

272
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,621
Wait?

273
00:26:03,825 --> 00:26:06,728
My evacuation code is 310275.

274
00:26:07,851 --> 00:26:11,091
- Evacuation code?
- Yes, evacuation code.

275
00:26:11,254 --> 00:26:13,655
And you giving me a number and..

276
00:26:13,902 --> 00:26:16,566
Walk out of here.
Free as a bird?

277
00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:18,206
No,

278
00:26:19,493 --> 00:26:21,098
I don't think so.

279
00:26:23,251 --> 00:26:28,477
You come in here, now
you belong to me.

280
00:26:28,772 --> 00:26:31,147
Your intake is finished.

281
00:26:31,707 --> 00:26:34,781
Wait..Wait. Come here, back.

282
00:26:34,782 --> 00:26:38,348
- Anything?
- I'm getting cold response, same as yesterday.

283
00:26:38,616 --> 00:26:40,640
You ran a full diagnostic on the system?

284
00:26:40,893 --> 00:26:44,935
- Twice.
- Run it again.

285
00:26:46,986 --> 00:26:50,306
P.A -All prisoners in A Block
proceed to dock 5.

286
00:26:50,441 --> 00:26:54,727
All prisoners in A Block
proceed to dock 5.

287
00:27:10,219 --> 00:27:11,720
Portos?

288
00:28:19,652 --> 00:28:21,590
Hey, ???

289
00:28:22,126 --> 00:28:25,001
Go make some friends,
You gonna need them.

290
00:29:18,485 --> 00:29:19,489
Damn!...Stay down!!

291
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:24,594
Stay Down !!

292
00:29:48,532 --> 00:29:51,582
New fish..we own you.

293
00:29:55,117 --> 00:29:56,690
Back Off!

294
00:30:02,868 --> 00:30:05,748
Last time...?

295
00:30:06,103 --> 00:30:11,199
Back away.

296
00:30:13,249 --> 00:30:14,421
Portos?

297
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:18,704
Rothmayar.. Emil Rothmayar.

298
00:30:20,882 --> 00:30:22,723
I'm really not in hand shaking mood,
right now.

299
00:30:25,056 --> 00:30:26,099
Okay...

300
00:30:27,711 --> 00:30:31,175
Your name..
The fourth musketeer.

301
00:30:31,937 --> 00:30:34,285
It's a good name.

302
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,516
Why are you in here?

303
00:30:39,393 --> 00:30:40,835
Why do you care?

304
00:30:40,884 --> 00:30:42,568
I used to run security for
a guy..

305
00:30:43,069 --> 00:30:46,723
By the name of Mannheim.

306
00:30:48,595 --> 00:30:49,815
Have you heard of the name?

307
00:30:49,974 --> 00:30:51,887
Mannheim..let me see?

308
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:52,929
No.

309
00:30:53,742 --> 00:30:55,500
- He is a genius.
- Really?

310
00:30:55,657 --> 00:30:59,553
He has this habit of taking money from
the rich and giving it to the poor.

311
00:30:59,754 --> 00:31:02,503
- You've heard that story before..
- I've heard the story, yeah.

312
00:31:03,555 --> 00:31:04,835
Now, they're trying to find him.

313
00:31:05,609 --> 00:31:07,242
But, I'm making it hard for them.

314
00:31:07,944 --> 00:31:08,905
Okay.

315
00:31:08,997 --> 00:31:10,279
So, fuck 'em.

316
00:31:10,636 --> 00:31:11,597
Right, fuck 'em.

317
00:31:14,965 --> 00:31:16,090
Portos,

318
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:19,294
- don't get killed.
- If you say so.

319
00:31:19,355 --> 00:31:20,835
Last time they killed a guy in here..

320
00:31:21,804 --> 00:31:24,101
They let his body
rot for three days.

321
00:31:27,035 --> 00:31:28,315
Oh..and cancel the prison dance.

322
00:31:34,018 --> 00:31:35,801
Wouldn't want to fuck up the prom.

323
00:31:42,209 --> 00:31:43,515
Morning, sir.

324
00:31:48,802 --> 00:31:50,340
That's another beautiful piece, sir.

325
00:31:53,218 --> 00:31:54,843
You lied to me.

326
00:31:55,036 --> 00:31:56,317
I lied to you?

327
00:31:56,574 --> 00:31:57,614
- I'm not sure...
- No..no.

328
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,785
You say nothing.

329
00:32:01,851 --> 00:32:04,291
What am I suppose to tell the client
about the man you killed.

330
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:08,713
That he just jumped?

331
00:32:08,775 --> 00:32:09,563
Like you said?

332
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:11,814
This isn't a free for all.

333
00:32:12,396 --> 00:32:14,797
We are paid to prevent
him from jumping.

334
00:32:15,229 --> 00:32:18,953
And I can't get proof of life,
from a dead man.

335
00:32:19,185 --> 00:32:20,013
So..

336
00:32:21,083 --> 00:32:24,749
You will be dock the entire price
of the asset.

337
00:32:25,446 --> 00:32:26,772
The entire price of the asset

338
00:32:26,773 --> 00:32:28,725
it goes on my months of my pain.

339
00:32:29,026 --> 00:32:31,267
Then, you're lucky this man you killed
wasn't high value.

340
00:32:32,179 --> 00:32:34,311
That is all, Gerry.

341
00:33:09,493 --> 00:33:11,278
Hey, Portos..

342
00:33:11,581 --> 00:33:13,291
Look at this.

343
00:33:14,321 --> 00:33:16,121
There is no sunrise or sunset,

344
00:33:16,199 --> 00:33:19,514
still, they pray all the time.

345
00:33:19,751 --> 00:33:22,153
Don't you find that interesting?

346
00:33:22,154 --> 00:33:23,535
Not really.

347
00:33:23,729 --> 00:33:27,022
You look like, the kind of a guy
that find this interesting.

348
00:33:27,201 --> 00:33:30,974
That kind, before?

349
00:33:31,469 --> 00:33:33,172
Why all the questions?

350
00:33:33,364 --> 00:33:34,727
It's how I learn things.

351
00:33:34,999 --> 00:33:37,660
You really ought to study
somebody else.

352
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:42,791
- Portos?
- What?

353
00:33:42,873 --> 00:33:43,784
You need a favour?

354
00:33:45,533 --> 00:33:47,538
Favour man.

355
00:34:13,063 --> 00:34:16,425
Compromising Correctional Institution
Security - Ray Breslin.

356
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:26,675
Well, for a man who is not interested.

357
00:34:27,251 --> 00:34:29,447
You are doing a lot of looking.

358
00:34:33,558 --> 00:34:35,408
What do you need?

359
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:38,774
I need to get into the isolation area.

360
00:34:38,967 --> 00:34:41,619
No, you really don't.

361
00:34:41,891 --> 00:34:43,926
Yeah, I really do.

362
00:34:44,197 --> 00:34:46,678
Call it..a favour.

363
00:34:46,892 --> 00:34:49,639
Okay?

364
00:34:50,447 --> 00:34:52,173
Okay.

365
00:35:00,146 --> 00:35:01,531
That's your favour?

366
00:35:01,828 --> 00:35:03,389
This one's gonna straight us good.

367
00:35:03,481 --> 00:35:04,810
Really?

368
00:35:04,905 --> 00:35:06,340
Come on.

369
00:35:06,433 --> 00:35:08,643
Let's see what you can do.

370
00:35:08,835 --> 00:35:10,489
Alright.

371
00:35:14,508 --> 00:35:16,205
You hit like a vegetarian.

372
00:35:16,341 --> 00:35:18,979
- Really?
- You can do better than that.

373
00:35:22,173 --> 00:35:23,378
Come on.

374
00:35:23,409 --> 00:35:26,234
- Let me see it.
- Try this.

375
00:35:29,251 --> 00:35:30,520
You hurt?

376
00:35:30,521 --> 00:35:33,050
- That's good.
- The good one's coming.

377
00:35:40,201 --> 00:35:42,944
Relax..let's pretend.

378
00:35:44,374 --> 00:35:47,004
I guess, boys will be boys.

379
00:35:47,767 --> 00:35:49,450
That's enough.

380
00:35:54,362 --> 00:35:56,178
Bring them in the barn now.

381
00:35:56,371 --> 00:35:59,000
You can thank me later.

382
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:33,683
Think.

383
00:36:33,877 --> 00:36:36,085
Think.

384
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:50,896
They knew, he was tagged.

385
00:36:51,089 --> 00:36:52,050
Of course, they knew.

386
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:53,283
Who do you think, this guys are?

387
00:36:53,491 --> 00:36:54,373
Who do you think?
They are a bunch of...

388
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:56,708
Yahoos..from one of those
BOP facilities?

389
00:36:56,904 --> 00:36:57,944
This is the shadows world.

390
00:36:58,204 --> 00:37:00,573
These guys, they invented
this shit.

391
00:37:01,132 --> 00:37:03,232
Why do you think
they are paying us all that money?

392
00:37:03,245 --> 00:37:04,514
Remember, what the guidelines were.

393
00:37:04,516 --> 00:37:05,956
What the fuck are you talking about?

394
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:09,012
There are no guidelines.
You call that CIA bitch.

395
00:37:09,071 --> 00:37:10,207
Hush?

396
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,857
Motherfucker.

397
00:37:18,193 --> 00:37:18,829
Alright..

398
00:37:19,299 --> 00:37:20,619
I'll make the call.

399
00:37:22,038 --> 00:37:24,999
Abigail, you gotta keep him..

400
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,880
Away from me. Alright?

401
00:37:41,538 --> 00:37:43,311
Give me your arm.

402
00:38:12,068 --> 00:38:13,418
You will live.

403
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:16,161
How do a doctor work,
in a place like this?

404
00:38:16,315 --> 00:38:18,786
Would you prefer,
there wasn't a doctor here?

405
00:38:19,041 --> 00:38:21,319
Where is here?

406
00:38:24,126 --> 00:38:25,900
Hey Doc, let's wrap it up.

407
00:38:46,381 --> 00:38:47,630
What did he asked you?

408
00:38:49,063 --> 00:38:51,620
He wanted to know his..

409
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:55,089
Dehydration is; Compared to the others.

410
00:38:56,603 --> 00:38:58,098
And what did ya tell him?

411
00:38:58,189 --> 00:38:59,551
I don't care.

412
00:39:01,331 --> 00:39:02,958
That's what I told him.

413
00:39:08,409 --> 00:39:10,955
Get him out of there!

414
00:39:24,705 --> 00:39:27,642
Did you find what you're looking for,
In the box?

415
00:39:33,451 --> 00:39:35,579
All prisoners back to your cell.

416
00:39:35,772 --> 00:39:38,358
All prisoners back to your cell.

417
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:53,257
Who were you before you
came in here, Portos?

418
00:39:55,418 --> 00:39:58,196
You are always, watching the room..
Always watching everything.

419
00:39:58,377 --> 00:40:00,379
Are you asking me,
what I used to do?

420
00:40:00,779 --> 00:40:01,581
Yeah.

421
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:02,542
I'll tell you.

422
00:40:02,704 --> 00:40:03,825
But I need a another favour.

423
00:40:04,493 --> 00:40:05,621
Fuck that.

424
00:40:05,829 --> 00:40:07,110
Alright, don't do it.

425
00:40:07,367 --> 00:40:09,448
Alright, I'm listening.

426
00:40:10,262 --> 00:40:11,478
What's the favour, this time?

427
00:40:11,647 --> 00:40:12,689
I need a piece of metal.

428
00:40:12,896 --> 00:40:13,736
About 3 inches wide..

429
00:40:14,867 --> 00:40:16,754
Round, smooth.

430
00:40:17,002 --> 00:40:18,303
Oh, no problem.

431
00:40:18,892 --> 00:40:20,811
I'll be right back, okay?

432
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:25,442
If you get me that piece of metal,
I might be able to get you.

433
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:27,328
Out of here.

434
00:40:34,168 --> 00:40:37,630
Tell Hobbes, I want to talk.

435
00:40:44,183 --> 00:40:45,863
You've been six months now, Mr. Rothmayar.

436
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:51,486
So, you know how this works.

437
00:40:53,373 --> 00:40:54,642
10 seconds.

438
00:40:57,805 --> 00:40:59,207
Where is Victor Manheim?

439
00:41:00,178 --> 00:41:01,256
You know to my people,

440
00:41:01,794 --> 00:41:04,110
- He is a hero.
- 9 seconds.

441
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,138
Do you have a pencil and
a piece of paper?

442
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:07,211
8 seconds.

443
00:41:07,387 --> 00:41:09,369
I could draw you a map.

444
00:41:10,099 --> 00:41:13,391
- Of what?
- Where you could find him.

445
00:41:23,153 --> 00:41:24,234
You know when I was a kid..

446
00:41:24,663 --> 00:41:25,971
I always wanted to be an artist.

447
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:28,296
My god, you're pushing it.

448
00:41:28,998 --> 00:41:30,113
The problem was..

449
00:41:30,583 --> 00:41:31,756
I had no talent.

450
00:41:32,093 --> 00:41:34,101
- 6 seconds.
- I tried.

451
00:41:34,707 --> 00:41:36,823
- And I tried and tried.
- 5..

452
00:41:37,717 --> 00:41:39,101
- Do you have dreams?
- 4...

453
00:41:39,102 --> 00:41:41,225
Did you always wanted to be..

454
00:41:41,927 --> 00:41:44,503
- This?
- 2..1!

455
00:41:44,689 --> 00:41:45,585
Done.

456
00:41:50,051 --> 00:41:51,456
There.

457
00:41:54,223 --> 00:41:55,408
I told you.

458
00:41:55,577 --> 00:41:58,883
No talent.

459
00:41:59,277 --> 00:42:02,834
Records indicate that you are
highly intelligent, huh?

460
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:03,864
Yeah.

461
00:42:04,263 --> 00:42:06,796
As such, I'd have expected you
to see the situation,

462
00:42:07,003 --> 00:42:08,324
and understand it for what it is.

463
00:42:08,349 --> 00:42:11,890
In here, you have no control
over any part of your life.

464
00:42:12,068 --> 00:42:12,989
Except, your breathing.

465
00:42:14,404 --> 00:42:16,223
And you just lost that privilege.

466
00:42:16,406 --> 00:42:17,381
Get him down.

467
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:53,333
Keep going.

468
00:42:58,729 --> 00:43:00,379
Enough.

469
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:44,047
- What happened?
- Nothing.

470
00:43:44,311 --> 00:43:45,137
I am still here.

471
00:43:48,445 --> 00:43:50,282
Now, it's your turn.

472
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:55,808
I break out of prisons,
for a living.

473
00:43:56,037 --> 00:43:58,882
For the past 8 years, I've been breaking
out of facilities

474
00:43:59,086 --> 00:44:00,447
for the federal bureau of prisons.

475
00:44:01,137 --> 00:44:05,240
I think, Hobbes been hired
for this place to make it unbreakable.

476
00:44:05,848 --> 00:44:07,414
Someone wanted this place tested.

477
00:44:07,847 --> 00:44:09,283
But it was a set up.

478
00:44:09,456 --> 00:44:11,276
They wanted to bury me.
I don't know who.

479
00:44:11,451 --> 00:44:12,412
But I'm gonna find out.

480
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,835
I need you to set up
another diversion.

481
00:44:16,061 --> 00:44:18,401
What now?

482
00:44:18,402 --> 00:44:20,334
You gotta go back, in the box.

483
00:44:20,526 --> 00:44:21,487
No fucking way.

484
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,913
Wanna get out of here?

485
00:44:26,552 --> 00:44:30,485
Okay. I'll do it.

486
00:44:30,841 --> 00:44:32,914
But if I don't get out...

487
00:44:33,107 --> 00:44:35,135
I'll kill you.

488
00:44:35,328 --> 00:44:36,300
Fair enough.

489
00:44:37,224 --> 00:44:39,626
The success for a break out
depends on three things.

490
00:44:39,627 --> 00:44:43,418
- Layout, routine and..help.
- What if this thing isn't build that way?

491
00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:44,572
It's not.

492
00:44:44,851 --> 00:44:46,652
Something under the box,
I think it's a cover.

493
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,068
If it is,
how do we know where it goes?

494
00:44:56,031 --> 00:44:57,989
Anyway, I'm gonna find out.

495
00:45:00,053 --> 00:45:02,648
- Eat.
- It's disgusting.

496
00:45:02,649 --> 00:45:06,107
The mind of an inmate works
differently than someone on the outside.

497
00:45:06,108 --> 00:45:08,319
He sees things differently.

498
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,334
The architecture is vertical.

499
00:45:10,804 --> 00:45:13,514
The cell blocks, the outer locks..
The box, the mess...

500
00:45:13,719 --> 00:45:16,579
everything is in large
vertical compartment.

501
00:45:18,418 --> 00:45:21,202
The best guess is they
build down underground,

502
00:45:21,394 --> 00:45:23,732
In large natural fixtures.
Like caves.

503
00:45:27,853 --> 00:45:29,128
If I can get in there.

504
00:45:29,298 --> 00:45:32,036
Follow where it goes,
I just might find out a way to the surface.

505
00:45:33,303 --> 00:45:35,705
If you are right,
How do you dug a metal?

506
00:45:35,706 --> 00:45:38,774
It don't cut, don't cut at all.

507
00:45:38,946 --> 00:45:40,106
This place is sub-terrainial.

508
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:41,316
There's moisture in the air.

509
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:44,405
Whoever build this place,
should've used aluminium.

510
00:45:44,685 --> 00:45:46,853
Which means, the whole panelling
is done with steel.

511
00:45:47,012 --> 00:45:47,936
Steel rust over time.

512
00:45:50,404 --> 00:45:54,064
The way around that is concentrating
the heat to boost through this.

513
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:56,604
This will panel with snap right
the fuck off.

514
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:00,969
- Concentrated heat?
- Yeah. With the piece of metal you gave me.

515
00:46:01,211 --> 00:46:03,651
We exposed it with the toothpaste
polished to rinse the metal.

516
00:46:03,763 --> 00:46:05,100
- To some heat.
- With the lamps at the box.

517
00:46:05,261 --> 00:46:06,143
Right.

518
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:08,471
At a 100 degree centigrade steel
on those panel with 3 cubic centimetre

519
00:46:08,588 --> 00:46:11,988
those bolt will come right off.

520
00:46:12,341 --> 00:46:14,152
What?

521
00:46:14,479 --> 00:46:16,473
- You don't look so smart.
- You don't either.

522
00:46:18,256 --> 00:46:20,557
See most prison are locked
to small towns.

523
00:46:20,748 --> 00:46:21,710
With an hour or more,

524
00:46:21,902 --> 00:46:24,196
we need supplies and workforce.

525
00:46:24,388 --> 00:46:27,482
Now, if I get to the surface,
I don't who can take me over the wall.

526
00:46:27,674 --> 00:46:30,527
But first, I'm gonna need that
diversion in the box.

527
00:46:30,893 --> 00:46:32,998
How much time do you need then?

528
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:34,151
3 to 5 minutes.

529
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:41,093
No problem.

530
00:47:02,066 --> 00:47:04,624
- Step back.
- I know you.

531
00:47:07,535 --> 00:47:10,004
You don't know shit.
You can't see that.

532
00:47:10,197 --> 00:47:12,326
Now, step back.

533
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,297
I know half of your brother.

534
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:15,224
Right.

535
00:47:15,733 --> 00:47:19,107
Your mother,
she was my favourite whore in marrakech.

536
00:47:19,322 --> 00:47:21,658
Man, she could polish that horn..

537
00:48:53,463 --> 00:48:54,526
Damn!

538
00:49:12,405 --> 00:49:13,935
You're killing me!

539
00:49:14,596 --> 00:49:18,482
You're killing me!

540
00:49:26,612 --> 00:49:29,136
What is he onto?

541
00:49:36,501 --> 00:49:38,828
Hey, shut the fuck up.
You german dog!

542
00:49:52,431 --> 00:49:55,865
Just hold him till I get there.

543
00:49:58,171 --> 00:49:59,967
Hey, I got a camera
malfunction in box 2.

544
00:50:00,158 --> 00:50:01,519
Roger that.
Just reboot the system.

545
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:10,617
Shit!

546
00:50:24,898 --> 00:50:26,632
Should we restrain and drug him, sir?

547
00:50:26,824 --> 00:50:27,786
Not yet.

548
00:50:49,527 --> 00:50:51,992
Lights off, box 4.

549
00:51:03,826 --> 00:51:05,242
A rough day, Mr. Rothmayar?

550
00:51:09,689 --> 00:51:11,634
Forgive me, Lord...

551
00:51:11,635 --> 00:51:13,101
Our Father, who art in heaven,

552
00:51:13,102 --> 00:51:14,544
hallowed be thy name;

553
00:51:14,664 --> 00:51:17,666
Thy kingdom come; Thy will be done;
On earth as it is in heaven.

554
00:51:17,667 --> 00:51:20,670
Give us this day our daily bread.

555
00:51:20,671 --> 00:51:23,771
And forgive us our trespasses, as we
forgive those who trespass against us.

556
00:51:23,772 --> 00:51:28,098
And lead us not into temptation;
But deliver us from evil.

557
00:51:30,332 --> 00:51:34,658
You're a bad person!
You are filled with the devil!

558
00:51:47,563 --> 00:51:51,215
Do not listen to those crazy...

559
00:51:51,216 --> 00:51:54,315
Who is lit
lantern in the bright morning,

560
00:51:54,316 --> 00:51:56,262
then go to the market...

561
00:51:56,263 --> 00:51:58,208
He continued to shout:
" I seek God!"

562
00:51:58,209 --> 00:52:00,131
" I seek God!"

563
00:53:10,085 --> 00:53:11,235
Here's what you should know.

564
00:53:12,169 --> 00:53:15,231
I don't care, sooner or later
you will tell me what I want to know.

565
00:53:15,423 --> 00:53:16,384
It's inevitable.

566
00:53:16,577 --> 00:53:17,537
Like dying.

567
00:53:17,729 --> 00:53:20,914
Know this,
there will come a point;

568
00:53:21,105 --> 00:53:23,362
Where I don't give a shit about you..

569
00:53:23,982 --> 00:53:26,972
Or whatever the fuck
you think you are doing right now.

570
00:53:27,163 --> 00:53:29,888
So, have a lovely day, Mr. Rothmayar.

571
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:11,713
Report.
Valve breach on level two sir.

572
00:54:11,906 --> 00:54:12,867
Electrical malfunction.

573
00:54:21,408 --> 00:54:22,314
Sir?

574
00:55:08,415 --> 00:55:09,615
- Did you make it?
- Yeah.

575
00:55:09,807 --> 00:55:10,768
Where are we?

576
00:55:11,899 --> 00:55:14,389
- Where are we?
- I don't know.

577
00:55:15,850 --> 00:55:16,898
They froze the check.

578
00:55:17,007 --> 00:55:18,247
What are we talking about here?

579
00:55:18,353 --> 00:55:20,433
The payment for Ray's services.
They froze the check.

580
00:55:22,466 --> 00:55:24,003
Not frozen, it's on hold.

581
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:25,662
Alright, it's very common.

582
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:27,488
- On 2.5 Million dollar transaction.
- No..no, no.

583
00:55:27,638 --> 00:55:29,573
Common would be a week,
maybe 10 days.

584
00:55:29,748 --> 00:55:31,828
- This has been way longer than that.
- Listen Abbey.

585
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:33,061
It's the federal government.

586
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:37,122
You know how they work.

587
00:55:37,123 --> 00:55:39,758
- Did you call that woman?
- Yeah, I called. Everything's fine.

588
00:55:39,964 --> 00:55:40,852
Then, where is he?

589
00:55:42,285 --> 00:55:44,703
He is on the job,
That he was hired to do.

590
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:46,135
So, you're saying
it's all good?

591
00:55:50,363 --> 00:55:51,201
It's all good.

592
00:55:51,393 --> 00:55:52,354
Where was the breach?

593
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:58,329
The auxiliary balance system sank outside.
Premise 5 and 7 has been compromised.

594
00:55:59,127 --> 00:56:02,255
Navigation ventilation is shocked on box 2.

595
00:56:04,374 --> 00:56:06,249
Portos?

596
00:56:17,722 --> 00:56:19,198
Layer is full of rust.

597
00:56:19,390 --> 00:56:21,110
Water pressure must've
snapped em clean off.

598
00:56:23,153 --> 00:56:24,230
Maybe.

599
00:56:31,304 --> 00:56:33,146
Portos isn't his name, is it?

600
00:56:33,338 --> 00:56:34,299
Why wasn't I alerted?

601
00:56:34,492 --> 00:56:38,935
Our client's been paying lots of money
to make sure that facility is unbreakable.

602
00:56:42,104 --> 00:56:44,507
Now, he is there to prove that,
not even he

603
00:56:44,508 --> 00:56:46,910
can get out. Now you make sure
he's there forever.

604
00:56:46,911 --> 00:56:48,865
Do you have a problem with that?

605
00:56:49,056 --> 00:56:50,018
No. No, not at all.

606
00:56:51,227 --> 00:56:52,716
Just the opposite.

607
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:53,870
Fucker.

608
00:56:55,251 --> 00:56:56,388
There's one more thing.

609
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:57,542
The chinese bank..

610
00:56:57,850 --> 00:57:01,153
Have joined the Brazilians, the russians
the english and the U.S

611
00:57:01,901 --> 00:57:04,904
and the swiss banks they're all paying
to find about the whereabouts of

612
00:57:05,098 --> 00:57:06,716
this Manheimler fellow.

613
00:57:06,862 --> 00:57:08,463
Word on the street is that
he's developed

614
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:10,936
a programme to turn the entire
world banking system

615
00:57:11,096 --> 00:57:13,128
into fucking confederate.

616
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:15,758
Rothmayar worked with that
asshole, he knows where he is.

617
00:57:15,951 --> 00:57:18,283
Your job, is to get that
information out of him.

618
00:57:18,475 --> 00:57:21,275
Well, it just so happens that
since Breslin has got close to Rothmayar,

619
00:57:22,026 --> 00:57:24,162
Rothmayar has developed a new edge,

620
00:57:24,354 --> 00:57:26,632
to his defiance that was not
there before.

621
00:57:26,849 --> 00:57:28,259
I think Breslin is to blame.

622
00:57:29,418 --> 00:57:33,263
- Then, break Breslin.
- Thank you.

623
00:57:34,771 --> 00:57:36,834
I have an assignment
I know you will enjoy.

624
00:58:04,663 --> 00:58:06,299
Get on your feet!

625
00:58:13,559 --> 00:58:14,932
Wakey, wakey.

626
00:58:22,787 --> 00:58:23,951
Talk to me.

627
00:58:24,144 --> 00:58:27,123
Come on, You must fight.

628
00:58:27,718 --> 00:58:29,585
Get up!

629
00:58:29,776 --> 00:58:30,737
Stay on your feet.

630
00:58:30,929 --> 00:58:33,285
If we're on a ship.
We would know.

631
00:58:33,477 --> 00:58:36,162
No. Not if you're over a
thousand feet long.

632
00:58:36,354 --> 00:58:39,865
200 feet high and stabilized
we wouldn't know a damn thing.

633
00:58:40,979 --> 00:58:42,499
Wakey, wakey.

634
00:58:42,691 --> 00:58:43,684
Get him on his feet.

635
00:58:54,552 --> 00:58:55,384
You can do it.

636
00:58:56,518 --> 00:58:59,514
- You are gonna do it.
- Can't get out of here.

637
00:58:59,706 --> 00:59:00,667
- Yes, we can.
- No!

638
00:59:03,113 --> 00:59:05,014
Get on your feet.

639
00:59:32,493 --> 00:59:33,801
Stop it now, Ray.

640
00:59:51,657 --> 00:59:53,953
Don't give up.
Don't let them break you.

641
00:59:54,425 --> 00:59:58,011
What made you want
to spend your life in prison?

642
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:00,836
Hmm? Tell me?

643
01:00:01,117 --> 01:00:02,721
What made you do it?

644
01:00:05,082 --> 01:00:06,644
Tell me!

645
01:00:13,632 --> 01:00:14,604
I was a lawyer,

646
01:00:15,602 --> 01:00:18,006
a prosecutor.

647
01:00:18,007 --> 01:00:21,504
The man that I put away,
made a promise to me.

648
01:00:22,138 --> 01:00:24,868
This man thought about this promise
everyday for three years.

649
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:28,451
Planning his way out of prison.

650
01:00:28,642 --> 01:00:31,593
Planning on how
he's gonna keep his word;

651
01:00:33,454 --> 01:00:34,875
Taking a man's life is nothing.

652
01:00:36,644 --> 01:00:38,875
Taking his heart?

653
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:42,044
That's everything, Isn't it?

654
01:00:46,892 --> 01:00:49,293
Everything.

655
01:00:57,187 --> 01:01:00,955
You see, putting people in prison
wasn't good enough.

656
01:01:01,627 --> 01:01:03,205
I had to. I wanted to..

657
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:06,861
Make sure they stay in there.
Not getting out.

658
01:01:07,299 --> 01:01:08,578
I understand.

659
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:10,520
I have a daughter.

660
01:01:11,731 --> 01:01:14,133
Never forget that.

661
01:01:14,134 --> 01:01:16,537
You have a choice.
You can die in here...

662
01:01:16,538 --> 01:01:18,940
or you can get out with me.
Punishing,

663
01:01:18,941 --> 01:01:21,267
who put you here.

664
01:01:21,709 --> 01:01:24,429
- You hear me?
- Yeah.

665
01:01:30,995 --> 01:01:31,835
Yeah.

666
01:01:32,027 --> 01:01:33,958
Good news and bad news.

667
01:01:34,151 --> 01:01:35,712
I was thinking about
that first meeting.

668
01:01:35,897 --> 01:01:37,597
Privatized Incarceration.

669
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:40,043
Off the grid,
international profile..

670
01:01:40,136 --> 01:01:41,197
And I started digging.

671
01:01:41,289 --> 01:01:42,350
Code name - The Tomb.

672
01:01:42,442 --> 01:01:44,204
Completely for profit.

673
01:01:44,241 --> 01:01:47,161
Totally, legal.
Run by ex-military ass holes.

674
01:01:47,353 --> 01:01:49,543
Blackwater rejects..
You know bad dudes.

675
01:01:49,734 --> 01:01:51,365
If Ray is anywhere, it's here.

676
01:01:51,556 --> 01:01:53,319
Where is here?

677
01:01:53,413 --> 01:01:56,143
That's the bad news.

678
01:01:56,498 --> 01:01:58,900
I don't know.

679
01:02:04,390 --> 01:02:06,139
We need excess to any layout.

680
01:02:08,302 --> 01:02:09,522
No blind times.

681
01:02:12,271 --> 01:02:14,511
We are in the middle of
the fucking ocean.

682
01:02:15,655 --> 01:02:18,173
I wouldn't be content
if we didn't find our team.

683
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:22,211
They've scrambled the guards shift
so they are never the same.

684
01:02:22,303 --> 01:02:26,125
But they can't change the routines
of the guards themselves.

685
01:02:26,171 --> 01:02:28,317
We don't know where they start.

686
01:02:28,509 --> 01:02:29,893
We don't know when they end.

687
01:02:30,088 --> 01:02:31,664
But I do know
where they're gonna be..

688
01:02:31,846 --> 01:02:32,588
Based on habit.

689
01:02:33,146 --> 01:02:35,123
See the guy coming down the stairs,

690
01:02:35,215 --> 01:02:37,136
see how he's walks
all pigeon toe?

691
01:02:37,235 --> 01:02:39,088
- The duck.
- Yeah, well..

692
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:41,845
Yeah, the duck always
work with the guy with grey on his neck.

693
01:02:42,532 --> 01:02:45,089
- Hives.
- Yeah, Hives.

694
01:02:45,667 --> 01:02:48,453
When Duck and Hives work together,
they always do it circular.

695
01:02:48,454 --> 01:02:50,855
And they do it,
at random times a day.

696
01:02:50,856 --> 01:02:53,643
It doesn't matter when they do it.
It always end up getting

697
01:02:53,644 --> 01:02:55,679
a 120 strides each.
Then, they spit up.

698
01:02:55,830 --> 01:02:56,470
Watch.

699
01:02:56,471 --> 01:02:58,815
Now, they each take a side.

700
01:02:58,874 --> 01:03:03,166
Duck walks 53 strides,
Hives 65, then they meet up at the top.

701
01:03:03,257 --> 01:03:06,332
The guard down there at the bottom.
That heavy set guy,

702
01:03:06,333 --> 01:03:07,738
He doesn't move much.

703
01:03:07,769 --> 01:03:11,093
My guess is he hasn't been here a while,
and only does what he has to do.

704
01:03:11,104 --> 01:03:13,418
Louisa.

705
01:03:13,888 --> 01:03:16,292
- Louisa?
- His standing style reminds

706
01:03:16,293 --> 01:03:18,694
me of my first girlfriend.

707
01:03:18,695 --> 01:03:20,237
Nice.

708
01:03:20,328 --> 01:03:23,446
That guard over there
could create a problem for us.

709
01:03:23,539 --> 01:03:25,634
- He is always looking around.
- The Chicken man.

710
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:28,038
Chicken man, right.

711
01:03:28,039 --> 01:03:31,461
My guess, Chick is new here.
Does everything by the book.

712
01:03:31,655 --> 01:03:33,235
How do you know
when the shift ends?

713
01:03:33,614 --> 01:03:34,442
I don't.

714
01:03:34,602 --> 01:03:37,482
Around this time, your girlfriend
Louisa starts looking at her watch.

715
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:41,741
My guess, it's lunch time.

716
01:03:42,092 --> 01:03:44,848
- Welcome back.
- Thanks.

717
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:47,382
But now that we got the routine,

718
01:03:47,575 --> 01:03:48,936
We just got to ask
the good doctor,

719
01:03:49,113 --> 01:03:50,045
Where the hell we are.

720
01:04:01,272 --> 01:04:03,724
I'm not permitted to give you
anything for the pain.

721
01:04:03,939 --> 01:04:04,922
So, don't request it.

722
01:04:04,923 --> 01:04:05,951
Hey, Doc..

723
01:04:06,335 --> 01:04:07,450
You took an oath.

724
01:04:08,296 --> 01:04:10,738
'According to my ability and judgement'

725
01:04:11,093 --> 01:04:13,276
' I'll protect my patients from
harm and injustice'.

726
01:04:27,852 --> 01:04:29,833
What exactly is that you
want from me?

727
01:04:30,492 --> 01:04:32,256
I wanna know,
where the hell I am.

728
01:04:51,275 --> 01:04:53,257
It's okay, it's under control.

729
01:04:53,449 --> 01:04:54,411
Put him back here.

730
01:05:05,925 --> 01:05:08,326
Sorry.

731
01:05:20,303 --> 01:05:21,463
- So?
- No luck.

732
01:05:22,944 --> 01:05:23,925
Push him harder.

733
01:05:24,118 --> 01:05:25,079
Pushing him is no hopes.

734
01:05:25,271 --> 01:05:26,232
What are the options?

735
01:05:27,001 --> 01:05:28,120
Plan-B.

736
01:05:30,369 --> 01:05:32,489
You always gotta have a plan-B.

737
01:05:39,111 --> 01:05:40,450
Did you get it?

738
01:05:50,358 --> 01:05:52,205
Now, I need his glasses.

739
01:07:02,247 --> 01:07:03,507
Sir?

740
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:04,661
Take a look at this.

741
01:07:09,736 --> 01:07:11,437
It's a makeshift sextant.

742
01:07:14,857 --> 01:07:16,057
Will it work this?

743
01:07:16,251 --> 01:07:17,211
It works.

744
01:07:18,365 --> 01:07:21,302
But it will only give us
half of our location.

745
01:07:25,639 --> 01:07:26,947
Bring Breslin.

746
01:07:28,997 --> 01:07:30,241
Ill explain how it works later,

747
01:07:30,432 --> 01:07:31,912
But first, we gotta get this outside.

748
01:07:32,427 --> 01:07:34,002
Watch out there.

749
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:49,527
Welcome to your new hole,

750
01:07:50,076 --> 01:07:51,535
Mr. Breslin.

751
01:07:52,704 --> 01:07:55,626
Actually, I've been waiting for??

752
01:07:55,817 --> 01:07:57,339
You know who I am?

753
01:07:57,644 --> 01:07:58,379
I do, now.

754
01:07:59,818 --> 01:08:02,221
I've studied your work,
very closely.

755
01:08:02,222 --> 01:08:04,623
It's quite brilliant.
As a matter of fact...

756
01:08:04,624 --> 01:08:07,026
It is what I used as reference guide
in designing..

757
01:08:07,027 --> 01:08:09,430
This facility.

758
01:08:09,431 --> 01:08:11,254
If you know what I am.
Let me go.

759
01:08:11,346 --> 01:08:12,342
No, no, no..no. Mr. Breslin,

760
01:08:12,343 --> 01:08:16,071
It's not how this works.
Not this time.

761
01:08:16,164 --> 01:08:18,313
You see, the people who paid
for you to be here;

762
01:08:18,507 --> 01:08:19,922
Want for you forever.

763
01:08:19,937 --> 01:08:23,086
And knowing that,
knowing who you are..

764
01:08:23,273 --> 01:08:26,176
Well, who you were.

765
01:08:27,701 --> 01:08:29,852
I can't have you
communicating with Rothmayar.

766
01:08:30,044 --> 01:08:31,732
Or with anybody else,
for that matter.

767
01:08:31,926 --> 01:08:33,630
This is the reality.

768
01:08:33,824 --> 01:08:35,578
And there is no way out.

769
01:08:35,770 --> 01:08:36,730
This can go, two ways.

770
01:08:37,235 --> 01:08:39,835
You let me go and I'll pretend
this never happened. If you don't..

771
01:08:39,932 --> 01:08:42,540
I'll burn this fucking place
to the ground on my way out.

772
01:08:44,334 --> 01:08:45,597
Effective right now.

773
01:08:45,790 --> 01:08:48,775
No mess, no rec time and

774
01:08:48,968 --> 01:08:49,930
no showers.

775
01:08:50,968 --> 01:08:53,909
I can get you Victor Mannheim.

776
01:08:54,370 --> 01:08:56,667
Rothmayer trust me.

777
01:08:58,975 --> 01:08:59,960
So, you say.

778
01:09:00,835 --> 01:09:02,811
- Not good enough.
- What've you got to loose?

779
01:09:03,012 --> 01:09:05,975
Finding him can be worth a lot more
than what you're paying for me.

780
01:09:06,163 --> 01:09:08,015
- Right, Hobbes?
- It's a nice idea but...

781
01:09:08,206 --> 01:09:11,935
As it stands right now,
I'm in line to get both.

782
01:09:12,163 --> 01:09:14,565
You will never break Rothmayer.
He'll die before he turns.

783
01:09:16,579 --> 01:09:18,713
I'm the only chance
to get what you want.

784
01:09:24,457 --> 01:09:26,693
I want Mannheim and his whole network.

785
01:09:26,885 --> 01:09:28,857
Names, locations in real time.

786
01:09:29,050 --> 01:09:30,891
Get back and if it checks out,
I'll let you go.

787
01:09:30,973 --> 01:09:31,642
But know this..

788
01:09:32,292 --> 01:09:34,908
You tell me every word that
you and Rothmayer shares or

789
01:09:35,088 --> 01:09:38,072
I will personally pull
the fucking life out of you.

790
01:09:38,316 --> 01:09:39,202
Fair enough.

791
01:09:46,265 --> 01:09:47,498
So, what happened?

792
01:09:47,691 --> 01:09:48,652
I'm playing you.

793
01:09:51,253 --> 01:09:54,417
Last night, Rothmayer told me he started
his network with 5 guys

794
01:09:54,609 --> 01:09:55,571
in his hometown.

795
01:09:57,261 --> 01:09:59,384
He said, he could trust his life
with this guys.

796
01:09:59,576 --> 01:10:00,537
Give Javed the sextant.

797
01:10:00,730 --> 01:10:01,691
Show him how to use it.

798
01:10:01,884 --> 01:10:03,984
And tell him,
it's his ticket out of here.

799
01:10:04,176 --> 01:10:05,138
Javed?

800
01:10:05,329 --> 01:10:06,450
He would rather see us dead.

801
01:10:06,710 --> 01:10:08,453
He'll be the last one they suspects.

802
01:10:08,857 --> 01:10:12,680
The (?) network caused the bank collapse
in Iceland six years ago.

803
01:10:12,876 --> 01:10:14,880
I don't give a shit about
six years ago.

804
01:10:15,072 --> 01:10:16,707
I wanna know where he is now.

805
01:10:34,739 --> 01:10:35,907
You wanna die?

806
01:10:37,317 --> 01:10:38,283
Do you wanna get out?

807
01:10:45,924 --> 01:10:47,405
Today?

808
01:10:49,943 --> 01:10:51,749
- They are planning an escape.
- An escape?

809
01:10:53,096 --> 01:10:55,870
Really? Who and when?

810
01:10:56,063 --> 01:10:57,063
I don't know the details.

811
01:10:59,036 --> 01:11:00,675
Just some.

812
01:11:00,866 --> 01:11:02,628
Tell me the details you know.

813
01:11:05,159 --> 01:11:06,872
You get me fixed first.

814
01:11:10,754 --> 01:11:15,009
Mr. Alfredo..Affidi, or whoever the fuck
your name is.

815
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:17,962
Your Opiate drug cartel friends
have paid a lot of money

816
01:11:17,963 --> 01:11:20,770
for you to be here.

817
01:11:21,261 --> 01:11:24,920
Of course, they did.
Those fucks.

818
01:11:25,112 --> 01:11:26,233
So, aside from your freedom,

819
01:11:28,816 --> 01:11:29,903
what else can I give you?

820
01:11:30,931 --> 01:11:32,661
I want the guards
to leave my people alone.

821
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:35,882
The Holy Qur'an

822
01:11:36,833 --> 01:11:37,996
I want one in my cell.

823
01:11:39,275 --> 01:11:40,715
And I want to say
the name of Allah..

824
01:11:42,226 --> 01:11:44,627
And the prophet Mohammad in the open air.

825
01:11:47,127 --> 01:11:48,248
I want to be seen by my God.

826
01:11:50,589 --> 01:11:51,789
When I say my evening prayers.

827
01:11:51,964 --> 01:11:52,926
That's all?

828
01:11:55,809 --> 01:11:56,799
That's all.

829
01:12:01,295 --> 01:12:03,593
I wanna be seen by my God, Mr. Hobbes.

830
01:13:57,805 --> 01:13:59,829
90 degrees 22 minutes.

831
01:14:01,484 --> 01:14:03,236
- ...
- North or south?

832
01:14:03,374 --> 01:14:06,848
The water basins turn clockwise,
above the equator, means we're in north.

833
01:14:07,041 --> 01:14:08,083
Did we get the longitude?

834
01:14:08,084 --> 01:14:13,200
The batch of fish in yesterday,
he said it's november 20th.

835
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:14,101
Without warm air,

836
01:14:14,538 --> 01:14:16,941
or sea, november.

837
01:14:16,942 --> 01:14:19,921
How do you build a secret facility

838
01:14:19,922 --> 01:14:21,939
and put it underwater.

839
01:14:21,940 --> 01:14:24,191
You have a terrific reason
toward northern latitude.

840
01:14:24,368 --> 01:14:25,648
Cos you wanna avoid rough water.

841
01:14:27,173 --> 01:14:29,845
So, you're gonna stay away
from the Caribbean and pacific sea.

842
01:14:30,035 --> 01:14:31,116
And you stick to China sea.

843
01:14:34,352 --> 01:14:37,033
If I was a betting man I'd say it
could be off the coast of Morocco.

844
01:14:37,173 --> 01:14:38,884
It's just a guest.

845
01:14:39,075 --> 01:14:44,071
In any case, its close to that sea.
That's my educated guess.

846
01:14:44,264 --> 01:14:48,295
I know a guy there, A Casablanca,
who owes me big time.

847
01:14:48,488 --> 01:14:49,569
Enough to come and get you?

848
01:14:49,779 --> 01:14:52,181
Huh, he'd still owe me.

849
01:14:52,182 --> 01:14:54,583
Is there a way to get a message out?

850
01:14:56,989 --> 01:14:59,987
My god.

851
01:15:05,341 --> 01:15:06,505
What is this?

852
01:15:07,062 --> 01:15:08,342
You swallowed a clotting powder?

853
01:15:12,243 --> 01:15:13,329
Listen to me.

854
01:15:13,993 --> 01:15:15,314
I know you think,
I'm playing you.

855
01:15:15,772 --> 01:15:18,042
In Hobbes's office,
there is a book.

856
01:15:18,233 --> 01:15:21,445
Compromising in Correctional Institution
Security By Ray Breslin,

857
01:15:21,684 --> 01:15:25,788
On page 8 is a detailed description of
cell block C of Lewis berg Federal Prison.

858
01:15:27,605 --> 01:15:29,653
- Guards?
- Check it out.

859
01:15:30,528 --> 01:15:32,929
And remember your oath.

860
01:15:35,334 --> 01:15:37,736
I can't stall Hobbes any more.

861
01:15:37,737 --> 01:15:40,861
- I gotta give him more location.
- We still doesn't have a plan.

862
01:15:41,841 --> 01:15:43,034
It's in the doctor's hands.

863
01:15:59,182 --> 01:16:03,278
The Hippocratic Oath.

864
01:16:37,129 --> 01:16:38,209
Guards?

865
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:42,079
Bring me prisoner Portos.
From A Block.

866
01:16:44,344 --> 01:16:47,582
Hobbes's orders, do it now.

867
01:16:54,848 --> 01:16:56,071
Breathe in.

868
01:17:00,629 --> 01:17:01,732
Okay.

869
01:17:03,611 --> 01:17:04,731
I saw the book.

870
01:17:04,923 --> 01:17:05,885
How did you know?

871
01:17:31,583 --> 01:17:36,016
What do you want me to do?

872
01:17:43,285 --> 01:17:45,984
The doctor is in.
Now, Javed has to do his part.

873
01:17:53,082 --> 01:17:57,615
The man you hunts base of operation
is 20 miles outside Sierra Russo.

874
01:17:57,806 --> 01:18:00,973
That's on the Bulgarian-Romania border.

875
01:18:05,704 --> 01:18:07,510
See?

876
01:18:07,702 --> 01:18:11,499
Ratting out a friend ain't so hard.

877
01:18:16,370 --> 01:18:20,651
We got 24 hours, before Hobbes realizes
that he Bulgarian location is bullshit.

878
01:18:21,670 --> 01:18:23,905
Who do we know in C block?

879
01:18:29,146 --> 01:18:31,277
You've got permission
for your midnight prayer?

880
01:18:31,601 --> 01:18:32,750
So, what do you have for me?

881
01:18:42,799 --> 01:18:45,308
- Lock in Breslin.
- Yes sir.

882
01:18:48,668 --> 01:18:51,028
What are you up to?

883
01:18:54,558 --> 01:18:57,376
Louder... louder.

884
01:18:57,568 --> 01:18:58,646
Got cha!

885
01:19:03,314 --> 01:19:04,317
Decode it.

886
01:19:15,714 --> 01:19:18,714
I need you in 24 hrs 30 degrees 22(N)
23 degrees 6(W) 5:00PM sharp tomorrow.

887
01:19:21,175 --> 01:19:25,631
BBQ and pool party. Don't forget
to tell the kids. Bring all toys.

888
01:19:26,365 --> 01:19:27,788
Rothmayar.

889
01:19:31,094 --> 01:19:32,290
Stop it.

890
01:19:35,645 --> 01:19:36,703
Zoom in.

891
01:19:39,408 --> 01:19:41,098
Its McMayer's son.

892
01:19:44,668 --> 01:19:47,336
Breslin is gonna have the sons help
breaking from cell block C.

893
01:19:47,527 --> 01:19:49,023
We have the time frame.

894
01:19:51,609 --> 01:19:53,756
And we have a location.

895
01:19:56,881 --> 01:19:58,757
Cell block C.

896
01:19:59,303 --> 01:20:00,868
Triple the guard force there.

897
01:20:01,060 --> 01:20:02,021
I wanna know everyone
who is involved here.

898
01:20:02,213 --> 01:20:03,874
You will sir.

899
01:20:06,234 --> 01:20:08,326
P.A: Cell block C prepare for inspection.

900
01:20:08,946 --> 01:20:11,879
Cell block C prepare for inspection.

901
01:20:20,114 --> 01:20:22,016
Louisa and Chicken man.

902
01:20:22,208 --> 01:20:23,769
They sent everyone else
to Cell block C.

903
01:20:27,102 --> 01:20:28,223
You better be fucking right.

904
01:20:28,703 --> 01:20:31,104
Don't worry.

905
01:20:33,508 --> 01:20:35,806
Hey, you fucking white trash
scum bag’s bitch!

906
01:20:36,382 --> 01:20:38,594
Where's do you think
you're fucking..

907
01:20:39,179 --> 01:20:41,583
- Your fucking sister..
- Fuck you.

908
01:20:43,987 --> 01:20:46,388
Motherfucker!

909
01:20:50,803 --> 01:20:52,978
The riot was suppose to break
from block C.

910
01:21:00,946 --> 01:21:02,557
Move the men from block C
to Babylon.

911
01:21:02,750 --> 01:21:03,711
Right now.

912
01:21:23,590 --> 01:21:24,592
Come on.

913
01:21:59,940 --> 01:22:02,570
Where the fuck is Breslin?

914
01:22:04,411 --> 01:22:05,386
Go, go..go.

915
01:22:05,578 --> 01:22:06,539
Let's move.

916
01:22:24,353 --> 01:22:27,193
We got 11 minutes to get to the top
let's hope the doc has made contact.

917
01:22:43,603 --> 01:22:44,963
What are you doing?

918
01:22:45,156 --> 01:22:47,398
All the cameras are connected.
We gotta block them out.

919
01:22:47,590 --> 01:22:48,551
Sir?

920
01:22:56,785 --> 01:22:59,187
Say, cheese!

921
01:23:18,107 --> 01:23:19,278
Fire ventilation. Let's go.

922
01:23:20,659 --> 01:23:23,071
Engage security protocol 5.

923
01:23:49,785 --> 01:23:51,947
We're out gunned.
The walls are locked outside.

924
01:23:52,141 --> 01:23:53,101
8 minutes.

925
01:23:53,519 --> 01:23:55,233
They are out of moves.

926
01:23:55,425 --> 01:23:57,193
Drake, take two men.

927
01:23:58,038 --> 01:24:01,129
Drag the rats back to cages.

928
01:24:41,102 --> 01:24:43,583
Javed!

929
01:24:45,109 --> 01:24:47,004
Open Gate 3!

930
01:24:58,847 --> 01:25:02,160
Go, go..go!
Don't fucking loose them.

931
01:25:05,186 --> 01:25:06,321
Breslin.

932
01:25:17,515 --> 01:25:18,520
We gotta move.

933
01:25:28,905 --> 01:25:31,991
As soon as that door's down.
I'll cover you guys from the other side.

934
01:25:32,963 --> 01:25:34,883
Breslin, how the hell did
they know where we are?

935
01:25:35,005 --> 01:25:37,220
You turned off the cameras, right?

936
01:25:45,065 --> 01:25:46,779
Motion detector.

937
01:25:46,971 --> 01:25:47,933
Sir?

938
01:25:48,125 --> 01:25:49,087
Out.

939
01:26:02,402 --> 01:26:05,863
You can play your games all day, Mr. Breslin.
But I am still in control.

940
01:26:06,808 --> 01:26:09,630
Whatever you do,
I have the power.

941
01:26:11,689 --> 01:26:13,081
I own your ass.

942
01:26:13,835 --> 01:26:15,115
You guys can get up that ladder.

943
01:26:16,681 --> 01:26:19,017
I gotta find the engine room.
We shut the power and wait them down.

944
01:26:19,209 --> 01:26:21,733
Those magnetic glasses door
open for about 5 seconds,

945
01:26:21,926 --> 01:26:23,850
before the back-up generator
kicks in. You understand?

946
01:26:24,043 --> 01:26:25,483
It's all the time you're gonna have.

947
01:26:29,546 --> 01:26:31,226
Take this, take it.

948
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:35,471
You are a good man.

949
01:26:35,772 --> 01:26:37,617
Go for it.

950
01:26:38,189 --> 01:26:39,276
What about you?

951
01:26:39,468 --> 01:26:40,231
I'll be right behind you.

952
01:26:40,422 --> 01:26:42,182
But what if you're not up
there on deck in 5.

953
01:26:42,587 --> 01:26:46,827
Do what you gotta do.
There's always plan B.

954
01:26:53,539 --> 01:26:54,819
Come with me, let's do it.

955
01:26:55,012 --> 01:26:55,974
I'm dead man.
There is no way out.

956
01:26:56,166 --> 01:26:57,126
You're coming with me.

957
01:26:58,631 --> 01:27:00,923
I'll carry you up there.

958
01:27:01,908 --> 01:27:04,573
- I'm not gonna leave you behind.
- Give me your gun.

959
01:27:07,127 --> 01:27:08,914
Just give me your gun.

960
01:27:23,111 --> 01:27:25,066
I'll see you up there.

961
01:27:25,312 --> 01:27:26,273
Now, go.

962
01:27:28,069 --> 01:27:31,412
Take care.

963
01:27:56,788 --> 01:27:59,505
- Report.
- Fuck you, motherfuckers.

964
01:27:59,697 --> 01:28:01,258
We are taking gunfire
at the lower deck.

965
01:28:03,022 --> 01:28:04,978
If they're at lower deck
it's going to be their exit route.

966
01:28:05,171 --> 01:28:06,891
Meet me at the engine room.
I'm coming down.

967
01:28:07,084 --> 01:28:08,044
Copy.

968
01:28:08,236 --> 01:28:10,323
- Get that fucker out.
- Yes, sir.

969
01:29:35,538 --> 01:29:38,777
Yeah. Whatever.

970
01:30:18,618 --> 01:30:19,513
Come on.

971
01:30:24,620 --> 01:30:26,710
I'll fucking kill you, motherfucker!

972
01:30:54,390 --> 01:30:55,951
- Yeah, he is here.
- We are on our way.

973
01:30:56,034 --> 01:30:58,055
- I'll take care of it.
- No, wait..wait!

974
01:31:43,319 --> 01:31:45,195
What the fuck?

975
01:32:41,745 --> 01:32:44,494
- Fuck me.
- No one gets off this ship.

976
01:33:16,152 --> 01:33:17,484
We have to move now!

977
01:33:17,676 --> 01:33:18,663
Not yet.

978
01:33:42,225 --> 01:33:44,219
Give yourself up, Mr. Breslin.

979
01:33:45,012 --> 01:33:48,635
Give a look around,
make some noise.

980
01:33:51,770 --> 01:33:53,932
This is no cell block.
You can't get out.

981
01:33:56,095 --> 01:33:57,853
Not really.

982
01:33:59,015 --> 01:34:02,960
I know about your wife...
your son.

983
01:34:06,578 --> 01:34:08,980
I know every detail.

984
01:34:08,981 --> 01:34:09,720
So, thank you.

985
01:34:09,913 --> 01:34:13,571
For pointing out all the small flaws
in my creation.

986
01:34:13,762 --> 01:34:16,043
I'll be sure to fortify them.

987
01:34:18,001 --> 01:34:19,998
Cos your time is up.

988
01:34:20,256 --> 01:34:21,706
You hear me?

989
01:34:22,824 --> 01:34:23,873
Breslin?

990
01:34:26,514 --> 01:34:28,693
Your time is up.

991
01:34:33,070 --> 01:34:36,993
Go in there.
Search every inch of this fucking room.

992
01:35:39,940 --> 01:35:41,191
Breslin?

993
01:35:56,599 --> 01:35:57,211
Go, down!

994
01:36:32,739 --> 01:36:35,621
Rothmayar! Gun!

995
01:36:35,622 --> 01:36:37,971
- Gun?
- Give me your gun.

996
01:37:17,545 --> 01:37:19,185
Boom.

997
01:37:30,328 --> 01:37:31,438
Have a lovely day.

998
01:37:32,404 --> 01:37:33,673
Asshole.

999
01:38:07,437 --> 01:38:08,483
Now, what?

1000
01:38:08,676 --> 01:38:09,637
Relax.

1001
01:38:46,864 --> 01:38:49,266
- You met her before.
- Jessica Miller.

1002
01:38:49,267 --> 01:38:51,669
It's an honour to meet you.

1003
01:38:51,670 --> 01:38:53,422
Your work is a gold standard in field.

1004
01:38:53,614 --> 01:38:56,022
She's been my eyes and ears
inside the Agency.

1005
01:38:56,214 --> 01:38:57,263
Hello, Dad.

1006
01:38:57,264 --> 01:38:59,473
And she's also my daughter.

1007
01:38:59,652 --> 01:39:00,575
Hello, darling.

1008
01:39:02,028 --> 01:39:03,339
Thank God, you made it.

1009
01:39:04,954 --> 01:39:05,916
I've missed you.

1010
01:39:07,521 --> 01:39:08,892
What happened?

1011
01:39:09,083 --> 01:39:10,404
Oh, nothing.
Don't worry about it.

1012
01:39:13,479 --> 01:39:14,678
You are Mannheim.

1013
01:39:16,837 --> 01:39:18,420
Didn't see that coming.

1014
01:39:18,614 --> 01:39:19,918
You shouldn't.

1015
01:39:20,441 --> 01:39:24,296
Yeah.

1016
01:39:24,920 --> 01:39:26,344
How did you do it?

1017
01:39:26,537 --> 01:39:27,497
We have code names.

1018
01:39:28,073 --> 01:39:32,457
Code name Rothmayar, meant
maximum security incarceration.

1019
01:39:33,361 --> 01:39:35,763
When my dad was picked up.

1020
01:39:35,764 --> 01:39:37,389
It activated the code.

1021
01:39:37,580 --> 01:39:40,739
- And that's when you...
- I needed the best.

1022
01:39:40,931 --> 01:39:42,397
And after you agreed to do it.

1023
01:39:42,791 --> 01:39:45,929
I used my contact deep inside
the DHS to get you in.

1024
01:39:46,122 --> 01:39:47,905
And the name you gave me
was the ID code?

1025
01:39:48,328 --> 01:39:49,447
Portos.

1026
01:39:51,193 --> 01:39:52,480
Rothmayar, Emil Rothmayar.

1027
01:39:53,143 --> 01:39:55,504
And I became your best friend.

1028
01:39:59,344 --> 01:40:01,192
You are not easy friend to have there.

1029
01:40:01,384 --> 01:40:03,551
I mean, I had to work very hard.

1030
01:40:03,743 --> 01:40:04,703
That damn box.

1031
01:40:04,896 --> 01:40:05,857
I mean, that was hot.

1032
01:40:06,352 --> 01:40:07,625
Didn't think you had warm yet.

1033
01:40:08,365 --> 01:40:09,672
But it doesn't matter.

1034
01:40:10,211 --> 01:40:13,067
What matters is that I am out,
so are you.

1035
01:40:13,926 --> 01:40:14,997
Don't sweat for no time.

1036
01:40:17,809 --> 01:40:21,462
You wanna try it again?

1037
01:40:21,688 --> 01:40:24,225
You son of a bitch.

1038
01:40:27,884 --> 01:40:30,386
- I hope, I never see you again.
- Well, that hurts.

1039
01:40:38,092 --> 01:40:39,162
One more thing.

1040
01:40:40,635 --> 01:40:43,365
- How much does Les really know?
- Only what I told him at first.

1041
01:40:44,115 --> 01:40:46,801
But the next thing I know,
he's going around me

1042
01:40:47,041 --> 01:40:48,683
and offered his services
to the backers of The Tomb.

1043
01:40:48,857 --> 01:40:50,257
So, he knew where I was being sent?

1044
01:40:50,287 --> 01:40:51,578
He arranged your transport.

1045
01:40:54,228 --> 01:40:55,612
You need a ride?

1046
01:40:55,805 --> 01:40:56,765
No, thanks.

1047
01:40:56,958 --> 01:40:58,158
I've made my own arrangements.

1048
01:41:12,265 --> 01:41:14,861
It wasn't tracking.
We knew something wasn't right.

1049
01:41:15,298 --> 01:41:17,341
Red flags going up all over the place.

1050
01:41:17,532 --> 01:41:20,214
Clark was too calm about it.
So, we started digging.

1051
01:41:20,873 --> 01:41:22,764
We found out,
he'd been offered the CEO job

1052
01:41:22,955 --> 01:41:24,355
of running the whole
tomb programme.

1053
01:41:24,579 --> 01:41:27,099
As a prototype, he would bear the proof
that it was inescapable.

1054
01:41:27,286 --> 01:41:29,366
With a salary of 5 million a year
plus stock options.

1055
01:41:29,535 --> 01:41:30,915
Tell me, you've tracked
him down.

1056
01:41:31,116 --> 01:41:33,277
Just like you asked.
The plan is in motion as we speak.

1057
01:41:44,910 --> 01:41:49,398
Sleeping time, motherfucker!

1058
01:42:01,463 --> 01:42:04,935
Oh, fuck!

1059
01:42:26,301 --> 01:42:28,039
Hush.

1060
01:42:28,252 --> 01:42:29,292
What did he say?

1061
01:42:29,501 --> 01:42:30,391
It's all good.

1062
01:42:31,898 --> 01:42:34,623
Good.

1063
01:42:35,543 --> 01:42:37,001
- What's that?
- Job offers.

1064
01:42:37,193 --> 01:42:38,706
Ignore them, maybe later.

1065
01:42:38,707 --> 01:42:41,280
Why don't you and me
have a very special dinner?

1066
01:42:41,281 --> 01:42:42,072
No, I'll cook.

1067
01:42:42,624 --> 01:42:46,122
Haven't I suffered enough?



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
