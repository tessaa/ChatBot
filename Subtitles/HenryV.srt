1
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,675
Oh, for a muse of fire...

2
00:02:15,775 --> 00:02:20,893
that would ascend the
brightest heaven of invention.

3
00:02:41,548 --> 00:02:44,450
A kingdom for a stage,

4
00:02:44,653 --> 00:02:46,147
princes to act...

5
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:51,173
and monarchs to behold
the swelling scene.

6
00:02:51,889 --> 00:02:54,542
Then should the warlike harry,
like himself,

7
00:02:54,642 --> 00:02:56,400
assume the port of Mars...

8
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,922
and at his heels,
leashed in like hounds,

9
00:03:00,022 --> 00:03:04,852
should famine, sword and fire
crouch for employment.

10
00:03:04,952 --> 00:03:08,342
But pardon, gentles all,

11
00:03:08,442 --> 00:03:10,870
the flat, unraised spirits...

12
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:13,655
that have dared
on this unworthy scaffold...

13
00:03:13,755 --> 00:03:17,649
to bring forth
so great an object.

14
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:21,595
Can this cockpit hold
the vasty fields of France

15
00:03:21,695 --> 00:03:25,245
or may we cram
within this wooden "o"...

16
00:03:25,345 --> 00:03:29,790
the very casques that did affright
the air at Agincourt?

17
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,350
Oh, pardon.

18
00:03:32,322 --> 00:03:34,400
Let us, ciphers
to this great account,

19
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,058
on your imaginary forces work.

20
00:03:37,158 --> 00:03:39,651
For it is your thoughts
that now must deck our kings,

21
00:03:39,751 --> 00:03:43,013
carry them here, there,
jumping o'er times,

22
00:03:43,113 --> 00:03:47,655
turning the accomplishment of
many years into an hourglass.

23
00:03:47,755 --> 00:03:52,649
For the which supply,
admit me, chorus, to this history,

24
00:03:52,749 --> 00:03:55,618
who, prologue-like,

25
00:03:55,917 --> 00:03:58,412
your humble patience pray...

26
00:03:58,512 --> 00:04:00,933
gently to hear,

27
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:03,657
kindly to judge...

28
00:04:04,113 --> 00:04:06,023
our play!

29
00:04:15,574 --> 00:04:18,126
My lord, I'll tell you.

30
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:26,361
That self bill is urged,
which, in the 11th year...

31
00:04:26,461 --> 00:04:29,114
of the last king's reign was
like to have passed against us.

32
00:04:29,214 --> 00:04:32,123
But how, my lord,
shall we resist it now?

33
00:04:32,223 --> 00:04:33,692
It must be thought on.

34
00:04:33,792 --> 00:04:36,574
If it pass against us, we lose the
better half of our possession.

35
00:04:36,674 --> 00:04:38,266
But what prevention?

36
00:04:38,754 --> 00:04:41,376
The king is full of grace
and fair regard.

37
00:04:41,476 --> 00:04:44,000
And a true lover
of the holy church.

38
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,241
The courses of his youth
promised it not.

39
00:04:46,341 --> 00:04:48,193
Since his addiction
was to courses vain,

40
00:04:48,293 --> 00:04:51,652
his hours filled up
with riots, banquets,

41
00:04:51,752 --> 00:04:55,173
sports and never noted
in him any study.

42
00:04:55,273 --> 00:04:57,862
But, my good lord,
how now for the mitigation...

43
00:04:57,962 --> 00:05:00,104
Of this bill
urged by the commons?

44
00:05:00,204 --> 00:05:02,440
Doth his majesty incline
to it or no?

45
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,706
He seems...
indifferent,

46
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:09,676
or rather swaying more
upon our part.

47
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:12,749
For I have made an offer
to his majesty,

48
00:05:12,849 --> 00:05:15,215
as touching France.

49
00:06:11,146 --> 00:06:14,112
Where is my gracious
lord of Canterbury?

50
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:35,314
God and his angels guard your sacred
throne and make you long become it.

51
00:06:35,414 --> 00:06:36,657
Sure we thank you.

52
00:06:37,014 --> 00:06:39,188
My learned lord,
we pray you to proceed...

53
00:06:39,288 --> 00:06:42,037
and justly and religiously unfold...

54
00:06:42,137 --> 00:06:44,951
why the law salique
that they have in France,

55
00:06:45,051 --> 00:06:49,113
or should or should not
bar us in our claim.

56
00:06:49,213 --> 00:06:53,787
And pray, take heed
how you impawn our person,

57
00:06:53,887 --> 00:06:58,044
how you awake
our sleeping sword of war.

58
00:06:58,144 --> 00:07:01,439
We charge you,
in the name of God, take heed.

59
00:07:01,539 --> 00:07:06,939
For never two such kingdoms did
contend without much fall of blood.

60
00:07:09,285 --> 00:07:12,068
Then hear me,
gracious sovereign.

61
00:07:12,168 --> 00:07:16,837
There is no bar to make against
your highness' claim to France...

62
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:21,060
but this, which they
produce from Pharamond.

63
00:07:22,602 --> 00:07:26,313
"In terram salicam
mulieres ne succedant."

64
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:32,205
"No woman shall succeed
in Salique land."

65
00:07:32,305 --> 00:07:36,462
Which Salique land
the French unjustly gloze...

66
00:07:36,562 --> 00:07:38,351
to be the realm of France.

67
00:07:38,451 --> 00:07:42,032
Yet their own authors
faithfully affirm...

68
00:07:42,132 --> 00:07:44,722
that the land Salique
lies in Germany...

69
00:07:44,822 --> 00:07:48,308
between the floods
of Sala and of Elbe.

70
00:07:48,408 --> 00:07:51,381
Then doth it well appear
the Salique law...

71
00:07:51,481 --> 00:07:54,935
was not devised
for the realm of France,

72
00:07:55,035 --> 00:07:57,432
nor did the French possess
the Salique land...

73
00:07:57,532 --> 00:08:02,618
until 421 years after
defunction of king Pharamond,

74
00:08:02,718 --> 00:08:07,702
idly supposed
the founder of this law.

75
00:08:08,896 --> 00:08:12,670
King Pepin,
which deposed childeric,

76
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:16,192
did, as heir general,
being descended of blithild,

77
00:08:16,292 --> 00:08:18,273
which was the daughter
to king Clothair,

78
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:20,418
make claim and title
to the crown of France.

79
00:08:20,518 --> 00:08:24,644
Hugh Capet, also, who usurped the
crown of Charles, the duke of Lorraine,

80
00:08:24,744 --> 00:08:28,133
sole heir male of the true line
and stock of Charles the great,

81
00:08:28,233 --> 00:08:30,970
could not keep quiet in his conscience
wearing the crown of France...

82
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:34,344
until satisfied that fair queen
Isabel, his grandmother,

83
00:08:34,444 --> 00:08:37,289
was lineal
of the Lady Ermengare,

84
00:08:37,389 --> 00:08:40,747
daughter to Charles,
the aforesaid duke of Lorraine,

85
00:08:40,847 --> 00:08:43,148
by the which marriage the line
of Charles the great...

86
00:08:43,248 --> 00:08:47,622
was reunited
to the crown of France.

87
00:08:51,507 --> 00:08:54,963
So it is clear
as is the summer sun.

88
00:08:56,789 --> 00:09:01,492
All appear to hold in right
and title of the female.

89
00:09:01,592 --> 00:09:04,790
So do the kings of France...

90
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:07,061
unto this day.

91
00:09:10,107 --> 00:09:14,490
Howbeit, they would hold up
this salique law...

92
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:20,219
to bar your highness
claiming from the female.

93
00:09:20,704 --> 00:09:25,312
May I, with right
and conscience,

94
00:09:25,412 --> 00:09:27,648
make this claim?

95
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:34,048
The sin upon my head,
dread sovereign.

96
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:41,735
Stand for your own.
Unwind your bloody flag.

97
00:09:41,835 --> 00:09:43,698
Your brother kings
and monarchs of the earth...

98
00:09:43,798 --> 00:09:45,894
do all expect that you
should rouse yourself...

99
00:09:45,994 --> 00:09:49,222
as did the former lions
of your blood.

100
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:52,710
Never king of England had nobles
richer and more loyal subjects...

101
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,862
whose hearts have left
their bodies here in England...

102
00:09:54,962 --> 00:09:56,933
and lie pavilioned
in the fields of France.

103
00:09:57,033 --> 00:09:59,301
Oh, let their bodies follow,
my dear liege,

104
00:09:59,401 --> 00:10:03,557
with blood and sword and fire
to win your right.

105
00:10:03,657 --> 00:10:05,794
In aid whereof,

106
00:10:06,184 --> 00:10:10,918
we of the spirituality
will raise your highness...

107
00:10:11,018 --> 00:10:13,701
such a mighty sum
as never did the clergy...

108
00:10:13,801 --> 00:10:17,508
at one time bring in to
any of your ancestors.

109
00:10:21,128 --> 00:10:24,355
Call in the messengers
sent from the Dauphin.

110
00:10:28,904 --> 00:10:32,645
Now are we well resolved,
and by God's help and yours,

111
00:10:32,745 --> 00:10:37,348
the noble sinews of our power,
France being ours,

112
00:10:37,448 --> 00:10:40,314
we'll bend it to our all...

113
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:46,492
or break it all to pieces.

114
00:10:55,943 --> 00:11:00,483
Now are we well prepared to know the
pleasure of our fair cousin Dauphin.

115
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:04,035
Your highness, lately sending into France
did claim some certain dukedoms...

116
00:11:04,135 --> 00:11:06,292
in the right of your great
predecessor, king Edward III.

117
00:11:06,392 --> 00:11:09,731
In answer of which claim,
the prince, my master,

118
00:11:09,831 --> 00:11:12,227
says that you savor
too much of your youth.

119
00:11:12,327 --> 00:11:17,986
He therefore sends you, meeter for
your spirit, this tun of treasure.

120
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,853
And in lieu of this, desires
you let those dukedoms...

121
00:11:21,953 --> 00:11:23,683
that you claim
hear no more of you.

122
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:27,074
This the Dauphin speaks.

123
00:11:27,366 --> 00:11:32,601
What... treasure, uncle?

124
00:11:38,629 --> 00:11:41,726
Tennis balls, my liege.

125
00:11:48,901 --> 00:11:52,641
We are glad the Dauphin
is so pleasant with us.

126
00:11:53,478 --> 00:11:58,178
His present and your pains
we thank you for.

127
00:11:58,757 --> 00:12:02,498
When we have matched
our rackets to these balls,

128
00:12:02,598 --> 00:12:05,507
we will in France,
by God's grace,

129
00:12:05,607 --> 00:12:10,562
play a set shall strike his
father's crown into the hazard.

130
00:12:10,662 --> 00:12:12,770
And we understand him well,

131
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:15,361
how he comes o'er us
with our wilder days,

132
00:12:15,461 --> 00:12:17,857
not measuring what use
we made of them.

133
00:12:17,957 --> 00:12:22,370
But tell the Dauphin
I will keep my state,

134
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:25,792
be like a king and show
my sail of greatness...

135
00:12:25,892 --> 00:12:29,185
when I do rouse me
in my throne of France.

136
00:12:29,285 --> 00:12:32,704
And tell the pleasant prince
this mock of his...

137
00:12:32,804 --> 00:12:34,593
hath turned his balls
to gunstones,

138
00:12:34,693 --> 00:12:37,312
and his soul
shall stand sore charged...

139
00:12:37,412 --> 00:12:39,649
for the wasteful vengeance
that shall fly with them.

140
00:12:39,749 --> 00:12:42,656
For many a thousand widows
shall this his mock,

141
00:12:42,756 --> 00:12:44,544
mock out of
their dear husbands,

142
00:12:44,644 --> 00:12:47,937
mock mothers from their sons,
mock castles down.

143
00:12:48,037 --> 00:12:50,304
And some are yet ungotten
and unborn...

144
00:12:50,404 --> 00:12:53,817
that shall have cause
to curse the Dauphin's scorn.

145
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:56,768
So get you hence in peace,

146
00:12:56,868 --> 00:12:59,584
and tell the Dauphin...

147
00:12:59,684 --> 00:13:04,736
his jest... will savor
but of shallow wit...

148
00:13:04,836 --> 00:13:09,754
when thousands weep
more than did laugh at it.

149
00:13:12,067 --> 00:13:14,716
Convey them with safe conduct.

150
00:13:16,451 --> 00:13:18,043
Fare you well.

151
00:13:31,457 --> 00:13:35,350
This was a merry message.

152
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:39,029
We hope to make the sender
blush at it.

153
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:43,550
Therefore, my lords,
omit no happy hour...

154
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:45,662
that may give furtherance
to our expedition.

155
00:13:45,762 --> 00:13:48,767
For we have now no thought
in us but France,

156
00:13:48,867 --> 00:13:52,890
save those to God
that run before our business.

157
00:13:52,993 --> 00:13:55,518
Therefore, let every man
now task his thought...

158
00:13:55,618 --> 00:14:00,950
that this fair action
may on foot be brought.

159
00:14:09,665 --> 00:14:12,733
Now all the youth of
England are on fire...

160
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:16,477
and silken dalliance
in the wardrobe lies.

161
00:14:16,577 --> 00:14:20,094
For now sits expectation
in the air...

162
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:23,613
and hides a sword,
from hilts unto the point,

163
00:14:23,713 --> 00:14:27,774
with crowns imperial,
crowns and coronets...

164
00:14:27,874 --> 00:14:32,344
promised to Harry and his followers.

165
00:14:46,655 --> 00:14:48,893
Well met, Corporal Nym.

166
00:14:48,993 --> 00:14:52,088
Good morrow,
Lieutenant Bardolph.

167
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:01,885
What, are you and Ancient Pistol friends yet?

168
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:05,397
For my part, I care not.

169
00:15:05,631 --> 00:15:07,091
I say little,

170
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:12,763
but when time shall serve,
there shall be smiles.

171
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,380
But that shall be as it may.

172
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,124
Come, I will bestow a breakfast
to make you friends,

173
00:15:20,224 --> 00:15:23,004
and we'll be all three
sworn brothers to France.

174
00:15:23,104 --> 00:15:26,646
- Let it be so, good corporal.
- I will do as I may.

175
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:31,388
It is certain, corporal, that Ancient
Pistol is married to Nell quickly.

176
00:15:31,488 --> 00:15:35,740
For certainly she did you wrong,
for you were betrothed to her.

177
00:15:42,686 --> 00:15:45,180
How now,
mine host Pistol?

178
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,870
Base tyke!

179
00:15:47,902 --> 00:15:49,884
Callest thou me host?

180
00:15:49,984 --> 00:15:52,795
Now, by this hand,
I swear I scorn the term!

181
00:15:52,895 --> 00:15:56,059
Nor shall my Nell
keep lodgers!

182
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,690
No, by my troth,
not long.

183
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:01,337
For we can't lodge or board
a dozen or 14 gentlewomen...

184
00:16:01,437 --> 00:16:03,737
who live honestly
by the prick of their needles,

185
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:06,617
but it shall be thought
we keep a bawdy house straight.

186
00:16:06,717 --> 00:16:10,329
- Pish!
- Pish for thee, Iceland dog!

187
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:12,696
Good Corporal Nym,

188
00:16:13,436 --> 00:16:15,833
show thy valor
and put up thy sword.

189
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:18,105
Will you shog off?

190
00:16:18,205 --> 00:16:22,297
Pistol, I will prick your guts
a little in good terms, as I may.

191
00:16:22,397 --> 00:16:24,442
That's the humor of it.

192
00:16:24,542 --> 00:16:27,641
- Braggart vile!
- Ah, hear me when I say,

193
00:16:27,741 --> 00:16:29,657
he that strikes
the first stroke,

194
00:16:29,757 --> 00:16:31,770
I'll run him up to the hilts,
as I'm a soldier.

195
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:34,138
An oath of mickle might,

196
00:16:34,238 --> 00:16:38,265
and fury shall abate.

197
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:39,365
My host Pistol!

198
00:16:39,772 --> 00:16:41,785
You must come to my master,
and you, hostess!

199
00:16:41,885 --> 00:16:44,697
He's very sick
and would to bed.

200
00:16:45,084 --> 00:16:48,274
Good Bardolph, put thy face between his
sheets and do the office of a warming pan.

201
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:51,185
Away, you rogue.

202
00:16:51,356 --> 00:16:54,802
Faith, he's very ill.

203
00:16:57,691 --> 00:16:58,835
By my troth,

204
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:02,422
the king has killed his heart.

205
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:04,756
Good husband,
come home presently.

206
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:21,015
Come, shall I make you two friends?
We must to France together.

207
00:17:21,115 --> 00:17:24,695
Why the devil should we keep
nives to cut one another's throats?

208
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:28,695
You'll pay me the eight shillings
I won of you at betting?

209
00:17:28,795 --> 00:17:32,535
Base is the slave that pays.

210
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:35,095
By this sword,
he that makes the first thrust,

211
00:17:35,195 --> 00:17:37,908
I'll kill him,
by this sword, I will.

212
00:17:38,394 --> 00:17:40,695
If ever you come of women,
come in quickly to Sir John.

213
00:17:40,795 --> 00:17:44,791
He is so shaked with
a burning quotidian fever...

214
00:17:44,891 --> 00:17:48,215
that it is most lamentable
to behold.

215
00:17:48,889 --> 00:17:51,254
Sweet men, come to him.

216
00:17:52,858 --> 00:17:55,287
Poor Sir John.

217
00:17:55,387 --> 00:17:58,733
A good portly man of faith.

218
00:18:04,634 --> 00:18:07,255
Aye, to a cheerful look,
a pleasing eye...

219
00:18:07,355 --> 00:18:10,995
and a most noble carriage.

220
00:18:18,233 --> 00:18:21,014
But do I not dwindle?

221
00:18:21,114 --> 00:18:24,853
My skin hangs about me
like an old lady's loose gown.

222
00:18:27,737 --> 00:18:30,904
Company, villainous company
have been the spoil of me.

223
00:18:35,001 --> 00:18:36,756
Whoo!
Hey! Hey!

224
00:18:38,904 --> 00:18:42,033
I was as virtuous
as a gentleman need to be.

225
00:18:42,135 --> 00:18:45,526
Virtuous enough.
Swore a little.

226
00:18:48,151 --> 00:18:51,476
Diced not above
seven days a week.

227
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:55,956
Went to a bawdy house
not above once in the quarter.

228
00:18:56,056 --> 00:18:58,988
Oh!

229
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:03,476
Paid money that I borrowed,

230
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:05,330
three or four times.

231
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:09,813
Lived well
and in good compass.

232
00:19:09,913 --> 00:19:12,852
What? You were so fat,
Sir John,

233
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:17,324
that you must indeed
be out of all compass.

234
00:19:17,463 --> 00:19:20,119
Do thou amend thy face,
and I'll amend my life.

235
00:19:35,703 --> 00:19:39,577
If sack and sugar be a fault,
then God help the wicked.

236
00:19:39,677 --> 00:19:43,035
Mmm? If to be old
and merry is a sin,

237
00:19:43,135 --> 00:19:46,271
if to be fat
is to be hated,

238
00:19:46,371 --> 00:19:52,003
then no, my good lord,
when thou art king,

239
00:19:53,738 --> 00:19:57,961
banish Pistol, banish Bardolph,
banish Nym.

240
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:01,967
But sweet Jack Falstaff,

241
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:04,242
Aliant Jack Falstaff,

242
00:20:04,342 --> 00:20:07,574
and therefore more valiant
being as he is,

243
00:20:07,674 --> 00:20:10,130
old Jack Falstaff,

244
00:20:10,428 --> 00:20:13,948
banish not him
thy Harry's company.

245
00:20:14,048 --> 00:20:18,785
Banish plump Jack,
and banish all the world.

246
00:20:21,447 --> 00:20:25,409
I do. I will.

247
00:20:29,296 --> 00:20:34,220
but we have heard the
chimes at midnight, master Harry.

248
00:20:37,144 --> 00:20:38,968
Jesus.

249
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:43,892
The days that we have seen.

250
00:20:45,217 --> 00:20:49,343
I know thee not, old man.

251
00:21:09,883 --> 00:21:13,178
The king hath run
bad humors on the knight.

252
00:21:14,624 --> 00:21:16,993
Nym, thou hast
spoke the right.

253
00:21:17,093 --> 00:21:22,310
His heart is fracted
and... corroborate.

254
00:21:23,818 --> 00:21:25,738
The king's a good king,

255
00:21:25,838 --> 00:21:29,002
but it must be as it may.

256
00:21:29,392 --> 00:21:32,393
He passes some humors
and careers.

257
00:21:33,044 --> 00:21:34,963
Let us condole the knight,

258
00:21:35,063 --> 00:21:40,434
for, lambkins,
we will live.

259
00:21:49,317 --> 00:21:52,167
The French, advised
by good intelligence...

260
00:21:52,267 --> 00:21:54,345
of this most dreadful
preparation,

261
00:21:54,445 --> 00:21:56,171
shake in their fear...

262
00:21:56,271 --> 00:21:59,950
and with pale policy seek
to divert the English purposes.

263
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:05,770
Oh, England, model
to thy inward greatness.

264
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,831
Like a little body
with a mighty heart.

265
00:22:07,931 --> 00:22:10,683
What mightst thou do
that honor would thee do...

266
00:22:10,783 --> 00:22:13,596
were all thy children
kind and natural?

267
00:22:13,696 --> 00:22:18,209
But see, thy fault France
hath in thee found out.

268
00:22:18,309 --> 00:22:22,183
A nest of hollow bosoms which he
fills with treacherous crowns...

269
00:22:22,283 --> 00:22:24,905
and three corrupted men.

270
00:22:25,005 --> 00:22:26,667
One, Richard Earl of Cambridge,

271
00:22:26,767 --> 00:22:29,326
and the second,
Henry Lord Scroop of Masham,

272
00:22:29,426 --> 00:22:32,721
and the third, Sir Thomas Grey, knight,
of Northumberland,

273
00:22:32,821 --> 00:22:35,829
have for the gilt of France...
oh, guilt indeed...

274
00:22:35,929 --> 00:22:38,873
confirmed conspiracy
with fearful France,

275
00:22:38,973 --> 00:22:43,197
and by their hands
this grace of kings must die,

276
00:22:43,297 --> 00:22:45,056
ere he take ship for France.

277
00:22:45,156 --> 00:22:46,722
The traitors are agreed.

278
00:22:46,822 --> 00:22:49,059
The king is set from London,

279
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:52,391
and the scene
is now transported, gentles,

280
00:22:52,491 --> 00:22:54,434
to Southhampton.

281
00:23:06,425 --> 00:23:09,658
Before God, his grace is bold
to trust these traitors.

282
00:23:09,758 --> 00:23:11,548
They shall be apprehended
by and by.

283
00:23:11,648 --> 00:23:14,079
How smooth and even
they do bear themselves,

284
00:23:14,179 --> 00:23:18,115
as if allegiance in their bosoms sat
crowned with faith and constant loyalty.

285
00:23:18,215 --> 00:23:22,312
The king hath note of all they intend by
interception which they dream not of.

286
00:23:22,412 --> 00:23:24,361
Nay, but the man
that was his bedfellow,

287
00:23:24,461 --> 00:23:27,020
whom he hath dulled and cloyed
with gracious favors...

288
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,127
That he should,
for a foreign purse,

289
00:23:30,227 --> 00:23:35,083
so sell his sovereign's life
to death and treachery.

290
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:44,694
Now sits the wind fair,
and we will aboard.

291
00:23:50,952 --> 00:23:53,352
My lord of Cambridge
and my kind lord of Masham...

292
00:23:53,452 --> 00:23:55,851
and you, my gentle knight,
give me your thoughts.

293
00:23:55,951 --> 00:23:58,542
Think you not that
the powers we bear with us...

294
00:23:58,642 --> 00:24:01,329
will cut their passage
through the force of France?

295
00:24:01,429 --> 00:24:04,948
No doubt, my liege, if each man
do his best. I doubt not that.

296
00:24:05,048 --> 00:24:08,376
Never was monarch better feared
and loved than is your majesty.

297
00:24:08,476 --> 00:24:12,317
We therefore have great
cause of thankfulness.

298
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:15,520
Uncle of Exeter, enlarge the
man committed yesterday...

299
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,474
that railed against
our person.

300
00:24:17,574 --> 00:24:21,736
We consider it was excess of
wine that set him on,

301
00:24:21,836 --> 00:24:23,530
And on his more advice
we pardon him.

302
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,964
That's mercy,
but too much security.

303
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:31,025
Let him be punished, lest example breed
by his sufferance, more of such a kind.

304
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:35,254
Oh, let us yet be merciful.

305
00:24:35,354 --> 00:24:38,617
So may your highness,
and yet punish too.

306
00:24:38,717 --> 00:24:41,052
Sir, you show great mercy
if you give him life...

307
00:24:41,152 --> 00:24:43,262
after the taste
of much correction.

308
00:24:43,362 --> 00:24:46,786
Alas, your too much love
and care of me...

309
00:24:46,886 --> 00:24:49,573
are heavy orisons
against this poor wretch.

310
00:24:49,673 --> 00:24:54,602
If little faults proceeding on
distemper shall not be winked at,

311
00:24:54,702 --> 00:25:00,368
how shall we stretch our eye
when capital crimes, chewed,

312
00:25:00,468 --> 00:25:03,816
swallowed and digested,
appear before us?

313
00:25:05,432 --> 00:25:07,608
We'll yet enlarge that man,

314
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:10,491
though Cambridge,
Scroop and Grey,

315
00:25:10,591 --> 00:25:13,919
in their dear care
and tender preservation...

316
00:25:14,019 --> 00:25:17,762
of our person
would have him punished.

317
00:25:18,983 --> 00:25:21,951
And now to
our French causes.

318
00:25:22,956 --> 00:25:25,228
Who are the late commissioners?
I one, my lord.

319
00:25:25,328 --> 00:25:27,629
Your highness bade me
ask for it today. So did you me.

320
00:25:27,729 --> 00:25:30,385
- And I.
- Then, Richard Earl of cambridge, there is yours.

321
00:25:30,485 --> 00:25:32,851
There yours,
Lord Scroop of Masham,

322
00:25:32,951 --> 00:25:35,478
and sir knight, Grey of
Northumberland, this same is yours.

323
00:25:35,578 --> 00:25:36,723
Read them...

324
00:25:36,891 --> 00:25:38,201
and know...

325
00:25:39,326 --> 00:25:42,621
I know your worthiness.

326
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:47,970
My Lord of Westmoreland,
uncle Exeter, we will aboard tonight.

327
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,507
Why, how now, gentlemen

328
00:25:54,607 --> 00:25:58,094
what see you in those papers
that you lose so much complexion?

329
00:25:58,194 --> 00:26:01,554
I do confess my fault and do
submit me to your highness' mercy.

330
00:26:01,654 --> 00:26:05,398
- To which we all appeal.
- The mercy that was quick in us of late...

331
00:26:05,498 --> 00:26:07,896
by your own counsel
is suppressed and killed.

332
00:26:07,996 --> 00:26:12,413
You must not dare for shame
to talk of mercy!

333
00:26:12,513 --> 00:26:18,015
For your own reasons turn into your bosoms
as dogs upon their masters worrying you.

334
00:26:28,114 --> 00:26:33,492
See you, my princes and my noble
peers, these English monsters.

335
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,927
What shall I say to thee,
Lord Scroop,

336
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:39,291
thou cruel, ingrateful,

337
00:26:39,391 --> 00:26:43,231
savage and inhuman creature?

338
00:26:43,331 --> 00:26:45,552
Thou knave thou!

339
00:26:45,652 --> 00:26:49,017
Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels,
that knewest the very bottom of my soul,

340
00:26:49,117 --> 00:26:50,983
that almost mightst have
coined me into gold,

341
00:26:51,083 --> 00:26:53,451
which thou have practiced
on me for thy use.

342
00:26:53,551 --> 00:26:56,013
May it be possible
that foreign hire...

343
00:26:56,113 --> 00:27:00,530
could out of thee extract one spark
of evil that might annoy my finger?

344
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:02,354
'Tis so strange...

345
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:06,649
that though the truth of it stand
off as gross as black and white,

346
00:27:06,749 --> 00:27:08,890
my eye will scarcely see it.

347
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:13,984
So... constant and unspotted
didst thou seem...

348
00:27:14,084 --> 00:27:17,733
that this thy fall
hath left a kind of blot...

349
00:27:17,833 --> 00:27:20,923
to mark
the full-fraught man...

350
00:27:21,023 --> 00:27:25,192
and best indued
with some suspicion.

351
00:27:29,576 --> 00:27:31,428
I will weep for thee.

352
00:27:31,528 --> 00:27:37,471
For this revolt of thine, methinks,
is like another fall of man.

353
00:27:54,212 --> 00:27:58,782
I arrest thee of high treason by the
name of Richard Earl of Cambridge.

354
00:28:00,258 --> 00:28:04,795
I arrest thee of high treason by the name
of Thomas Grey, Knight of Northumberland.

355
00:28:06,498 --> 00:28:11,100
I arrest thee of high treason by the
name of Henry Lord Scroop of Masham.

356
00:28:15,489 --> 00:28:17,015
Hear your sentence.

357
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,221
You have conspired
against our royal person,

358
00:28:20,321 --> 00:28:22,685
joined with an enemy
proclaimed and from his coffers...

359
00:28:22,785 --> 00:28:24,989
received the golden earnest
of our death wherein.

360
00:28:25,089 --> 00:28:27,228
You would have sold your king
to slaughter,

361
00:28:27,328 --> 00:28:29,435
his princes and his peers
to servitude,

362
00:28:29,535 --> 00:28:31,419
his subjects to oppression
and contempt...

363
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:35,323
and his whole kingdom
into desolation!

364
00:28:37,053 --> 00:28:41,657
Get you therefore hence, poor
miserable wretches, to your death,

365
00:28:41,757 --> 00:28:45,497
the taste whereof God of his mercy
give you patience to endure...

366
00:28:45,597 --> 00:28:50,580
and true repentance
of all your dear offenses.

367
00:28:52,059 --> 00:28:53,203
Bear them hence.

368
00:29:00,762 --> 00:29:02,615
Now, Lords, for France,

369
00:29:02,715 --> 00:29:05,876
the enterprise whereof shall
be to you, as us, like glorious,

370
00:29:05,976 --> 00:29:10,577
since God so graciously hath brought to light
this dangerous treason lurking in our way.

371
00:29:10,677 --> 00:29:12,300
Cheerly to sea.

372
00:29:13,171 --> 00:29:14,958
The signs of war advance.

373
00:29:15,058 --> 00:29:19,755
No king of England
if not king of France.

374
00:30:01,331 --> 00:30:04,046
Prithee, honey-sweet husband,
let me bring thee to staines.

375
00:30:04,146 --> 00:30:09,195
No, for my manly heart
doth yearn.

376
00:30:09,295 --> 00:30:12,521
Bardolph, be blithe.

377
00:30:14,091 --> 00:30:17,575
Nym, rouse
thy vaunting veins.

378
00:30:17,675 --> 00:30:22,339
Boy, bristle
thy courage up.

379
00:30:22,598 --> 00:30:24,898
For Falstaff is dead,

380
00:30:24,998 --> 00:30:28,000
and we must yearn therefore.

381
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,908
Would I were with him, wheresome'er
he is, either in heaven or in hell.

382
00:30:31,008 --> 00:30:32,285
Nay, sure,
he's not in hell.

383
00:30:32,385 --> 00:30:36,985
He's in Arthur's bosom, if ever
a man went to Arthur's bosom.

384
00:30:37,373 --> 00:30:41,810
He made a finer end and went away
an it had been any Christian child.

385
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:47,605
He parted even
just between 12:00 and 1:00,

386
00:30:49,462 --> 00:30:51,827
even at the turning of the tide.

387
00:30:52,819 --> 00:30:55,663
For after I saw him
fumble with the sheets...

388
00:30:55,763 --> 00:31:00,743
and play with flowers and
smile upon his finger's ends,

389
00:31:01,613 --> 00:31:04,642
I knew there was
but one way.

390
00:31:07,177 --> 00:31:10,109
For his nose
was as sharp as a pen,

391
00:31:12,262 --> 00:31:15,194
and he babbled of green fields.

392
00:31:16,228 --> 00:31:18,240
"How now, Sir John," quoth I.

393
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:20,638
"What, man?
Be of good cheer."

394
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,263
So he cried out,
"God, God,

395
00:31:26,814 --> 00:31:28,372
God,"

396
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:31,987
Three or four times.

397
00:31:35,735 --> 00:31:39,730
Now I, to comfort him, bid him
he should not think of God.

398
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:43,371
I hoped there was no need to trouble himself
with any such thoughts yet.

399
00:31:47,024 --> 00:31:49,989
He bade me put
more clothes on his feet.

400
00:31:50,223 --> 00:31:54,408
I put my hand under the bed
and felt them,

401
00:31:57,194 --> 00:32:00,256
and they were as cold
as any stone.

402
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:04,926
Then I felt to his knees,

403
00:32:06,373 --> 00:32:11,224
and so upward... and upward,

404
00:32:15,006 --> 00:32:16,412
and all was as...

405
00:32:18,332 --> 00:32:20,240
cold as any stone.

406
00:32:27,287 --> 00:32:30,385
They say he cried out for sack.
That he did.

407
00:32:30,485 --> 00:32:32,464
And of women.
No, that he did not.

408
00:32:32,564 --> 00:32:33,711
Yeah, that he did.

409
00:32:33,811 --> 00:32:36,878
He said they were...
devils incarnate.

410
00:32:36,978 --> 00:32:40,236
He could never abide carnation.
It was a color he never liked.

411
00:32:41,358 --> 00:32:43,593
He said once the devil
would have him about women.

412
00:32:43,693 --> 00:32:48,520
Well, he did in some sort...
handle women.

413
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:54,178
But then he was rheumatic and
talked of the whore of Babylon.

414
00:32:54,278 --> 00:32:58,080
Do you not remember he saw a flea
stick upon Bardolph's nose?

415
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:01,438
He said it was a black soul
burning in hell.

416
00:33:01,538 --> 00:33:04,252
Well, the fuel is gone
that maintained that fire.

417
00:33:04,352 --> 00:33:07,315
That's all the riches
I got in his service.

418
00:33:11,259 --> 00:33:12,567
Whall we shog?

419
00:33:13,913 --> 00:33:16,594
The king will be gone
from Southampton.

420
00:33:31,789 --> 00:33:33,097
Farewell, hostess.

421
00:33:35,403 --> 00:33:36,831
I cannot kiss.

422
00:33:37,705 --> 00:33:39,717
That's the humor of it.

423
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:40,993
But...

424
00:33:47,012 --> 00:33:48,352
Adieu.

425
00:34:02,681 --> 00:34:05,461
Let housewifery appear.

426
00:34:05,816 --> 00:34:09,009
Keep close.

427
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,721
I thee command.

428
00:34:17,264 --> 00:34:18,604
Farewell.

429
00:34:30,248 --> 00:34:31,556
Adieu.

430
00:34:38,626 --> 00:34:41,598
Follow, follow.

431
00:34:41,698 --> 00:34:45,275
For who is he whose chin is but
enriched with one appearing hair...

432
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:49,208
that will not follow these
culled and choice-drawn cavaliers...

433
00:34:49,308 --> 00:34:51,160
to France?

434
00:35:11,917 --> 00:35:16,997
Thus comes the English...
with full power upon us,

435
00:35:18,889 --> 00:35:23,871
and more than carefully it us concerns
to answer royally in our defenses.

436
00:35:25,605 --> 00:35:28,384
Therefore,
the dukes of Berri...

437
00:35:28,484 --> 00:35:29,943
and of Bretagne,

438
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:35,032
of Brabant and of Orleans
shall make forth.

439
00:35:35,518 --> 00:35:37,243
And you, prince Dauphin...

440
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:38,906
My most redoubted father,

441
00:35:39,006 --> 00:35:42,935
it is most meet we arm us
against the foe.

442
00:35:43,035 --> 00:35:46,260
For peace itself
should not so dull a kingdom,

443
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,914
but the defenses, musters,
preparations should be maintained,

444
00:35:49,014 --> 00:35:51,922
assembled and collected,
as were a war in expectation.

445
00:35:52,022 --> 00:35:55,087
Therefore, I say 'tis meet
we all go forth to view...

446
00:35:55,187 --> 00:35:57,774
the sick and feeble
parts of France.

447
00:35:57,874 --> 00:36:00,875
And let us do it
with no show of fear!

448
00:36:00,975 --> 00:36:03,817
No, with no more than if we heard
that England were busied with,

449
00:36:03,917 --> 00:36:06,919
uh, a Whitsun morris dance.

450
00:36:07,019 --> 00:36:10,725
For, my good liege, she is so idly
kinged by a vain, giddy, shallow,

451
00:36:10,825 --> 00:36:13,251
humorous youth,
that fear attends her not.

452
00:36:13,351 --> 00:36:14,659
O peace, prince dauphin.

453
00:36:14,759 --> 00:36:17,312
You're too much mistaken
in this king.

454
00:36:17,412 --> 00:36:20,542
Question, your grace,
the late ambassadors.

455
00:36:20,642 --> 00:36:23,676
With what great state
he heard their embassy,

456
00:36:23,776 --> 00:36:26,682
how well supplied
with noble counselors,

457
00:36:26,782 --> 00:36:31,256
how modest in exception
and withal how terrible...

458
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:34,100
in constant resolution.

459
00:36:38,422 --> 00:36:40,306
Well, 'tis not so,
my lord high constable.

460
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:43,376
Though we think it so,
'tis no matter.

461
00:36:43,476 --> 00:36:46,830
In matters of defense, 'tis best to weigh
the enemy more mighty than he seems.

462
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:50,220
Think we king Harry strong.

463
00:36:52,301 --> 00:36:56,640
And, princes, look you
strongly armed to meet him.

464
00:36:56,906 --> 00:36:59,750
For he is bred
out of that bloody strain...

465
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:03,903
that haunted us
in our familiar paths.

466
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:06,722
Witness our too-much
memorable shame...

467
00:37:06,822 --> 00:37:11,192
when cressy battle
fatally was struck...

468
00:37:12,065 --> 00:37:15,227
and all our princes captived...

469
00:37:15,327 --> 00:37:18,454
by the hand
of that black name,

470
00:37:18,747 --> 00:37:19,990
Edward,

471
00:37:20,443 --> 00:37:23,855
black prince of Wales.

472
00:37:26,423 --> 00:37:31,314
This is a stem
of that victorious stalk.

473
00:37:31,414 --> 00:37:34,607
And let us fear
the native mightiness...

474
00:37:34,707 --> 00:37:37,006
and fate of him.

475
00:37:57,123 --> 00:38:01,341
Ambassadors from Harry, king of England,
do crave admittance to your majesty.

476
00:38:02,049 --> 00:38:04,567
Go and bring them.

477
00:38:07,549 --> 00:38:11,288
You see, this chase
is hotly followed, friends.

478
00:38:17,399 --> 00:38:21,202
Good my sovereign,
take up the English short,

479
00:38:21,302 --> 00:38:25,105
and let them know of what a
monarchy you are the head.

480
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:31,362
Self-love, my liege, is not so vile
a sin as self-neglecting.

481
00:38:46,788 --> 00:38:48,643
From our brother England?

482
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:53,479
From him, and thus
he greets your majesty.

483
00:38:53,772 --> 00:38:57,197
He wills you, in the
name of God almighty,

484
00:38:57,297 --> 00:38:59,632
that you divest yourself
and lay apart...

485
00:38:59,732 --> 00:39:02,963
the borrowed glories
that by gift of heaven,

486
00:39:03,063 --> 00:39:04,725
by law of nature
and of nations,

487
00:39:04,825 --> 00:39:07,801
belongs to him
and to his heirs.

488
00:39:07,901 --> 00:39:10,837
Namely, the crown.

489
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:15,037
Willing you overlook
this pedigree.

490
00:39:16,709 --> 00:39:18,176
And when you find him
evenly derived...

491
00:39:18,276 --> 00:39:22,313
from his most famed of famous
ancestors, Edward the III,

492
00:39:22,413 --> 00:39:27,984
he bids you then resign your crown
and kingdom, indirectly held from him,

493
00:39:28,084 --> 00:39:31,315
the native and true challenger.

494
00:39:31,415 --> 00:39:34,448
Or else what follows?

495
00:39:35,611 --> 00:39:37,270
Bloody constraint.

496
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:41,791
For if you hide the crown,
even in your hearts,

497
00:39:41,891 --> 00:39:44,610
there will he rake for it.

498
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:47,813
Therefore, in fierce
tempest is he coming,

499
00:39:47,913 --> 00:39:51,177
in thunder and in earthquake,
like a Jove,

500
00:39:51,277 --> 00:39:55,304
that if requiring fail,
he will compel.

501
00:39:56,242 --> 00:40:00,914
This is his claim,
his threatening and my message.

502
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,185
Unless the Dauphin
be in presence here,

503
00:40:04,285 --> 00:40:06,876
to whom expressly
I bring greeting to.

504
00:40:06,976 --> 00:40:08,799
For the Dauphin,

505
00:40:10,434 --> 00:40:12,855
I stand here for him.

506
00:40:18,731 --> 00:40:20,394
What to him from England?

507
00:40:20,494 --> 00:40:23,015
Scorn and defiance,

508
00:40:23,344 --> 00:40:27,090
slight regard, contempt...

509
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:30,966
and anything that might not
misbecome the mighty sender,

510
00:40:31,066 --> 00:40:33,782
doth he prize you at.

511
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,570
Thus says my king.

512
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:40,257
Say, if my father render a fair
return, it is against my will,

513
00:40:40,357 --> 00:40:42,981
for I desire nothing
but odds with England.

514
00:40:43,081 --> 00:40:46,408
And to that end, as matching
to his youth and vanity,

515
00:40:46,508 --> 00:40:49,547
I did present him
with the Paris balls!

516
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:52,811
He'll make your Paris Louvre
shake for it.

517
00:40:53,714 --> 00:40:55,731
And be assured
you'll find a difference,

518
00:40:55,831 --> 00:40:58,581
as we, his subjects,
have in wonder found,

519
00:40:58,681 --> 00:41:02,740
between the promise of his greener
days and these he masters now.

520
00:41:03,869 --> 00:41:05,180
Tomorrow...

521
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,591
Shall you know
our mind at full.

522
00:41:15,722 --> 00:41:18,507
Thus with imagined wing
our swift scene flies,

523
00:41:18,607 --> 00:41:23,017
in motion of no less celerity
than that of thought!

524
00:41:23,701 --> 00:41:27,221
Work, work your thoughts, and
in them see a siege!

525
00:41:27,321 --> 00:41:28,855
Behold the ordinance
on their carriages,

526
00:41:28,955 --> 00:41:32,535
with fatal mouths gaping
on girded harflew.

527
00:41:33,503 --> 00:41:35,447
Suppose the ambassador
from the French comes back,

528
00:41:35,547 --> 00:41:38,053
tells Harry that the king does
offer him Katherine, his daughter,

529
00:41:38,153 --> 00:41:40,805
and with her to dowry, some
petty and unprofitable dukedoms.

530
00:41:40,905 --> 00:41:42,791
The offer likes him not.

531
00:41:42,891 --> 00:41:45,834
And the nimble gunner with linstock
now the devilish cannon touches,

532
00:41:45,934 --> 00:41:49,232
and down goes all before them!

533
00:41:59,484 --> 00:42:02,012
Once more unto the breach,
dear friends!

534
00:42:02,112 --> 00:42:06,532
Once more, or close the wall up
with our English dead!

535
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,112
In peace there's nothing so becomes a
man as modest stillness and humility.

536
00:42:20,212 --> 00:42:22,420
But when the blast of war
blows in our ears,

537
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,565
then imitate the action
of the tiger!

538
00:42:24,665 --> 00:42:26,712
Stiffen the sinews,
summon up the blood,

539
00:42:26,812 --> 00:42:29,147
disguise fair nature
with hard-favored rage.

540
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:31,229
Then lend the eye
a terrible aspect.

541
00:42:31,329 --> 00:42:33,928
Let it pry through the portage of
the head like the brass cannon.

542
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:37,284
Let the brow o'erwhelm it as
fearfully as doth a galled rock...

543
00:42:37,384 --> 00:42:39,302
o'erhang and jetty
his confounded base,

544
00:42:39,402 --> 00:42:41,480
swilled with the wild
and wasteful ocean.

545
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:44,748
Now set the teeth
and stretch the nostril wide,

546
00:42:44,848 --> 00:42:50,099
hold hard the breath and bend up
every spirit to his full height!

547
00:42:50,199 --> 00:42:53,368
On, on, you noblest England!

548
00:42:58,110 --> 00:43:02,208
Now attest that those whom you
called fathers did beget you.

549
00:43:02,308 --> 00:43:05,572
And you, good yeoman, whose
limbs were made in England,

550
00:43:05,672 --> 00:43:07,366
show us here the mettle
of your pasture.

551
00:43:07,466 --> 00:43:11,403
Let us swear that you are worth
your breeding, which I doubt not!

552
00:43:11,503 --> 00:43:16,305
For there is none of you so mean and base
that hath not noble luster in your eyes!

553
00:43:16,405 --> 00:43:20,469
I see you stand like greyhounds in
the slips, straining upon the start.

554
00:43:20,569 --> 00:43:23,416
The game's afoot!
Follow your spirit,

555
00:43:23,516 --> 00:43:27,677
and upon this charge, cry,
"God for Harry,

556
00:43:27,777 --> 00:43:31,704
England and Saint George!"

557
00:43:32,581 --> 00:43:37,065
God for harry,
England and Saint George!

558
00:43:46,132 --> 00:43:50,739
Up to the breach,
you dogs!

559
00:43:51,418 --> 00:43:54,932
Avaunt, you cullions!

560
00:44:03,624 --> 00:44:06,281
Captain Fluellen, you must
come presently to the mines.

561
00:44:06,381 --> 00:44:08,491
The duke of Gloucester
would speak with you.

562
00:44:08,591 --> 00:44:11,310
Tell the duke it is not so good
to come to the mines.

563
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:15,026
For look you, the mines is not
according to the disciplines of war.

564
00:44:15,126 --> 00:44:18,486
By Cheshu, I think he will
blow up all,

565
00:44:18,586 --> 00:44:21,619
if there is not
better direction.

566
00:44:22,206 --> 00:44:23,885
The duke of Gloucester,
to whom the order...

567
00:44:23,985 --> 00:44:28,346
of the siege is given, is altogether
directed by an Irishman.

568
00:44:28,612 --> 00:44:31,044
It's Captain Macmorris, is it not?

569
00:44:31,144 --> 00:44:34,473
- I think it be.
- By Cheshu, he is an ass in the world.

570
00:44:34,573 --> 00:44:36,586
He has no more directions...

571
00:44:36,686 --> 00:44:40,746
in the true disciplines of the
wars than is a puppy dog.

572
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:44,198
Here he comes, and the Scots
captain, Captain Jamy, with him.

573
00:44:44,298 --> 00:44:48,119
Oh, no, Captain Jamy is a marvelous,
valorous gentleman, that is certain.

574
00:44:48,219 --> 00:44:52,220
I say... good day,
Captain Fluellen.

575
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,270
Good day to your worship,
good Captain James.

576
00:44:54,370 --> 00:44:57,633
How now, Captain Macmorris?
Have you quit the mines? By Christ, la.

577
00:44:57,733 --> 00:44:59,588
The workish give over.

578
00:44:59,688 --> 00:45:01,189
The trumpets
sound the retreat.

579
00:45:01,289 --> 00:45:03,593
By my hand,
'tis ill done.

580
00:45:03,693 --> 00:45:06,540
Captain Macmorris,
I beseech you now,

581
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,872
a few disputations as partly
touching the disciplines of the war,

582
00:45:09,972 --> 00:45:12,050
partly to satisfy
my opinion...

583
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:14,837
and partly for
the satisfaction of my mind,

584
00:45:14,937 --> 00:45:17,816
as touching the direction
of the military discipline.

585
00:45:17,916 --> 00:45:20,699
That is the point. It is no time
to discourse, so Christ save me.

586
00:45:20,799 --> 00:45:23,170
The town is besieged, and the
trumpet calls us to the breach.

587
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:25,505
We talk, and, by Christ,
do nothing.

588
00:45:25,605 --> 00:45:28,645
By the mass, ere these eyes of mine
take themselves to slumber,

589
00:45:28,745 --> 00:45:32,842
I'll do good service, or I'll
lie in the ground for it.

590
00:45:32,942 --> 00:45:34,764
Captain Macmorris,
I think, look you,

591
00:45:34,864 --> 00:45:37,519
under your correction, there
are not many of your nation.

592
00:45:37,619 --> 00:45:41,133
What is my nation?

593
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:43,030
Who talks of my nation
is a villain...

594
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:46,745
and a bastard and a knave
and a rascal?

595
00:45:46,845 --> 00:45:50,878
Look you, if you take the matter otherwise
than it is meant, Captain Macmorris,

596
00:45:50,978 --> 00:45:52,961
peradventure I shall think
you do not use me...

597
00:45:53,061 --> 00:45:57,606
with that affability as in discretion
you ought to use me, now look you,

598
00:45:57,706 --> 00:46:00,681
being as good
a man as yourself.

599
00:46:00,781 --> 00:46:03,563
I do not know you
so good a man as myself.

600
00:46:03,663 --> 00:46:07,439
So Christ save me,
I will cut off your head!

601
00:46:33,361 --> 00:46:36,362
How yet resolves
the governor of the town?

602
00:46:36,853 --> 00:46:40,181
This is the latest parle
we will admit.

603
00:46:40,376 --> 00:46:43,000
Therefore, to our best mercy
give yourselves,

604
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:47,477
or, like to men proud of
destruction, defy us to our worst.

605
00:46:47,713 --> 00:46:51,042
For as I am a soldier, if I
begin the battery once again,

606
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:52,996
I will not leave
the half-achieved Harflew...

607
00:46:53,096 --> 00:46:56,576
till in her ashes
she lie buried.

608
00:46:56,810 --> 00:46:59,211
Therefore,
you men of Harflew,

609
00:46:59,311 --> 00:47:01,839
take pity of your town
and of your people...

610
00:47:01,939 --> 00:47:05,042
whiles yet my soldiers
are in my command,

611
00:47:05,142 --> 00:47:08,566
whiles yet the cool
and temperate wind of grace...

612
00:47:08,666 --> 00:47:12,538
o'erblows the filthy
and contagious clouds...

613
00:47:12,638 --> 00:47:17,439
of heady murder,
spoil and villainy!

614
00:47:17,539 --> 00:47:22,181
If not, why, in a moment
look to see...

615
00:47:22,281 --> 00:47:26,025
the blind and bloody
soldier with foul hand...

616
00:47:26,125 --> 00:47:29,452
defile the locks of your shrill,
shrieking daughters,

617
00:47:29,552 --> 00:47:32,015
your fathers taken
by their silvered beards...

618
00:47:32,115 --> 00:47:34,771
and their most reverend heads
dashed to the walls,

619
00:47:34,871 --> 00:47:38,263
your naked infants
spitted upon pikes...

620
00:47:38,363 --> 00:47:43,003
whiles the mad mothers
with their howls confused...

621
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:45,493
do break the clouds!

622
00:47:46,595 --> 00:47:48,025
What say you?

623
00:47:48,261 --> 00:47:52,519
Will you yield and this avoid?

624
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:55,690
Or, guilty in defense,

625
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:57,994
be thus destroyed?

626
00:47:58,993 --> 00:48:02,514
The Dauphin, of whose
succor we entreated,

627
00:48:02,614 --> 00:48:08,345
returns us that his powers are not
yet ready to raise so great a siege.

628
00:48:08,445 --> 00:48:11,990
Therefore, dread king,

629
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:17,267
enter our gates,
dispose of us and ours,

630
00:48:19,381 --> 00:48:22,313
for we no longer
are defensible.

631
00:48:49,758 --> 00:48:51,898
Go you and enter Harflew.

632
00:48:51,998 --> 00:48:55,959
There remain and fortify it
strongly against the French.

633
00:48:56,059 --> 00:48:59,982
Use... mercy to them all.

634
00:49:02,742 --> 00:49:05,649
For us, dear uncle,
the winter coming on...

635
00:49:05,749 --> 00:49:08,399
and sickness growing
upon our soldiers,

636
00:49:08,499 --> 00:49:12,356
we will retire to Calais.

637
00:49:14,637 --> 00:49:18,249
Tonight... in Harflew
will we be your guest.

638
00:49:18,349 --> 00:49:23,029
Tomorrow... for the march
are we addressed.

639
00:49:46,778 --> 00:49:47,955
Alice.

640
00:49:57,594 --> 00:49:59,831
Alice,
tu as ete en angleterre,

641
00:49:59,931 --> 00:50:02,039
et tu parles bien le langage.

642
00:50:02,139 --> 00:50:03,631
Un peu, madame.

643
00:50:04,634 --> 00:50:07,087
Je te prie, m'enseignez.

644
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:09,688
Il faut que j'apprenne
a parler.

645
00:50:09,788 --> 00:50:12,887
Comment appelez-vous
la main en anglais?

646
00:50:12,987 --> 00:50:16,563
La main?
Elle est appelee"de" hand.

647
00:50:17,402 --> 00:50:19,408
"De hand."
Mm-hmm.

648
00:50:20,826 --> 00:50:21,970
Et les doigts?

649
00:50:22,075 --> 00:50:25,143
Les doigts?
Ma foi, j'oublie les doigts.

650
00:50:25,243 --> 00:50:27,543
Mais je me souviendrai.
Les doigts?

651
00:50:27,643 --> 00:50:31,917
Je pense qu'ils sont appeles
"de fingres."

652
00:50:33,370 --> 00:50:37,623
Le main, de hand.
Le doigts, de fingres.

653
00:50:37,723 --> 00:50:38,998
Mm-hmm.

654
00:50:40,378 --> 00:50:41,816
Je pense que je suis
le bon ecolier.

655
00:50:41,916 --> 00:50:44,471
J'ai gagne deux mots
d'anglais vitement.

656
00:50:44,571 --> 00:50:47,063
Comment appelez-vous les ongles?
Les ongles?

657
00:50:47,163 --> 00:50:49,713
Nous les appelons
de nails.

658
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:51,536
"De nails."

659
00:50:53,562 --> 00:50:55,254
Ecoutez, dites-moi
si je parle bien.

660
00:50:55,354 --> 00:51:01,174
De hand, de fingres
etde nails.

661
00:51:01,274 --> 00:51:05,231
C'est bien dit, madame.
Il est fort bon anglais.

662
00:51:05,593 --> 00:51:07,510
Dites-moi I'anglais
pour le bras.

663
00:51:07,610 --> 00:51:09,686
De arm, madame.
Et le coude?

664
00:51:09,786 --> 00:51:11,606
D'elbow.

665
00:51:12,729 --> 00:51:14,070
"D'elbow."

666
00:51:16,025 --> 00:51:17,179
Je m'en fais la repetition...

667
00:51:17,279 --> 00:51:20,630
De tous les mots que vous
m'avez appris des a present.

668
00:51:20,730 --> 00:51:23,445
Il est trop difficile,
madame, comme je pense.

669
00:51:23,545 --> 00:51:26,710
Excusez-moi, Alice,
ecoutez: De hand, de fingres,

670
00:51:26,810 --> 00:51:30,549
de nails, de "arma,"
de "bilbow," "d'elbow", madame.

671
00:51:30,649 --> 00:51:33,778
O, seigneur dieu,
je m'en oublie! D'elbow.

672
00:51:34,169 --> 00:51:35,606
Comment appelez-vous
le col?

673
00:51:35,706 --> 00:51:37,362
De "nick," madame.

674
00:51:37,688 --> 00:51:39,597
- "De nick."
- Mmm.

675
00:51:39,897 --> 00:51:43,285
Et le menton?
De chin.

676
00:51:43,385 --> 00:51:45,358
"De chin."

677
00:51:46,616 --> 00:51:48,210
Le col, de nick.

678
00:51:48,310 --> 00:51:50,451
Le menton, de chin.

679
00:51:51,224 --> 00:51:54,134
Oui, sauf votre honneur,
en verite,

680
00:51:54,234 --> 00:51:57,781
vous prononcez les mots aussi
droit que les natifs d'angleterre.

681
00:51:57,881 --> 00:52:00,886
Je ne doute point d'apprendre par la
grace de dieu, et en peu de temps.

682
00:52:00,986 --> 00:52:03,765
N'avez-vous pas deja oublie
ce que je vous ai enseigne?

683
00:52:03,865 --> 00:52:06,293
Non, je reciterai
a vous promptement:

684
00:52:06,393 --> 00:52:10,742
De hand, de fingres.
Tsk. Mmm.

685
00:52:10,842 --> 00:52:13,173
- De "mails"?
- De nails, madame.

686
00:52:13,273 --> 00:52:14,741
"De nails, madame."

687
00:52:14,841 --> 00:52:19,028
- De arma, de belbow.
- Sauf votre honneur, d'elbow.

688
00:52:19,128 --> 00:52:21,780
Ainsi dis-je:
D'elbow, de nick,

689
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:24,463
Etde chin.
Oh.

690
00:52:25,783 --> 00:52:28,308
Comment appelez-vous
le pied et la robe?

691
00:52:28,408 --> 00:52:32,372
De foot, madame,
et de coun.

692
00:52:32,472 --> 00:52:36,779
- F-footet 'le coun.
- Mmm.

693
00:52:39,863 --> 00:52:41,520
O seigneur dieu!

694
00:52:42,263 --> 00:52:45,876
Ce sont mots de son mauvais
corruptible,

695
00:52:45,976 --> 00:52:48,979
Gros, et impudique et non pour
les dames d'honneur d'user.

696
00:52:49,079 --> 00:52:53,203
Je ne voudrais prononcer ces mots devants
les seigneurs de france pour tout le monde.

697
00:52:53,303 --> 00:52:56,373
De footet 'le coun!

698
00:53:01,335 --> 00:53:05,651
Neanmoins, je reciterai une
autre fois ma lecon ensemble.

699
00:53:05,751 --> 00:53:08,883
De hand, de fingres,

700
00:53:08,983 --> 00:53:12,084
De nails, de arma, de...

701
00:53:12,184 --> 00:53:16,309
De nick, de chin, de foot
et 'le coun!

702
00:53:39,605 --> 00:53:43,794
'Tis certain...
He hath passed the river Somme.

703
00:53:43,894 --> 00:53:47,730
And if he be not fought withal,
my lord, let us not live in France.

704
00:53:47,830 --> 00:53:51,827
Normans.
But bastard Normans!

705
00:53:51,927 --> 00:53:54,064
Norman... bastards!

706
00:53:54,197 --> 00:53:57,970
Where have they this mettle is not
their climate foggy, raw and dull?

707
00:53:58,070 --> 00:54:01,042
- O, for honor of our land.
- By faith and honor,

708
00:54:01,142 --> 00:54:06,126
our madams mock at us and
plainly say our mettle is bred out!

709
00:54:07,926 --> 00:54:12,306
And they will give their bodies
to the lust of English youth...

710
00:54:12,406 --> 00:54:17,074
to new-store France
with bastard warriors!

711
00:54:18,037 --> 00:54:21,363
Where is Montjoy, the herald?

712
00:54:21,845 --> 00:54:23,273
Speed him hence.

713
00:54:24,373 --> 00:54:28,609
Let him greet England
with our sharp defiance.

714
00:54:29,217 --> 00:54:30,617
Up, princes,

715
00:54:31,089 --> 00:54:35,179
and with spirit of honor edged
more sharper than your swords,

716
00:54:35,279 --> 00:54:36,869
hie to the field.

717
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:40,233
Bar Harry England,

718
00:54:41,322 --> 00:54:43,397
that sweeps through our land...

719
00:54:43,497 --> 00:54:46,658
with pennons painted
in the blood of Harflew.

720
00:54:46,758 --> 00:54:51,358
Go down upon him.
You have power enough.

721
00:54:51,809 --> 00:54:57,042
And in a captive chariot into
Rouen bring him our prisoner.

722
00:54:58,493 --> 00:55:01,240
This becomes the great.

723
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:03,607
Sorry am I his numbers
are so few,

724
00:55:03,707 --> 00:55:06,261
his soldiers sick and famished
in their march.

725
00:55:06,361 --> 00:55:08,435
For I am sure when he
shall see our army,

726
00:55:08,535 --> 00:55:11,538
he'll drop his heart
into the sink of fear...

727
00:55:11,638 --> 00:55:14,383
and, for achievement,
offer us his ransom.

728
00:55:14,483 --> 00:55:20,652
Therefore, lord constable,
haste on montjoy.

729
00:55:21,165 --> 00:55:26,311
Prince Dauphin,
you shall stay with us in Rouen.

730
00:55:26,411 --> 00:55:28,742
Not so, I do beseech
your majesty.

731
00:55:28,842 --> 00:55:32,644
Be patient, for you
shall remain with us!

732
00:55:34,661 --> 00:55:38,143
Now forth, lord constable
and princes all,

733
00:55:38,243 --> 00:55:42,427
and quickly bring us word
of England's fall.

734
00:57:00,936 --> 00:57:02,461
Come. Come in.

735
00:57:08,324 --> 00:57:09,435
Captain Fluellen?

736
00:57:10,817 --> 00:57:13,501
Come you from the bridge?
Is the duke of Exeter safe?

737
00:57:13,601 --> 00:57:16,634
De is not...
God be praised and blessed...

738
00:57:16,734 --> 00:57:22,030
any hurt in the world, but keeps the bridge
most valiantly, with excellent discipline.

739
00:57:22,968 --> 00:57:27,786
Captain! I thee beseech
to do me favors.

740
00:57:28,948 --> 00:57:31,407
The duke of Exeter
doth love thee well.

741
00:57:31,507 --> 00:57:35,693
Aye, I praise God, and I have
merited some love at his hands.

742
00:57:35,793 --> 00:57:38,634
Bardolph, a soldier firm
and sound of heart...

743
00:57:38,734 --> 00:57:40,738
and buxom valor,

744
00:57:41,037 --> 00:57:46,598
hath by cruel fate and giddy
fortune's furious, fickle wheel...

745
00:57:46,698 --> 00:57:50,289
Touching your patience,
Ancient Pistol,

746
00:57:50,544 --> 00:57:53,084
fortune is an excellent moral.

747
00:57:53,184 --> 00:57:56,996
Fortune is Bardolph's foe
and frowns on him...

748
00:57:57,096 --> 00:58:01,416
for he hath stolen a pax
and hanged must he be.

749
00:58:01,516 --> 00:58:03,541
Therefore, go speak.

750
00:58:04,346 --> 00:58:07,858
The duke will hear thy voice.

751
00:58:08,877 --> 00:58:11,997
Speak, captain, for his life,

752
00:58:12,097 --> 00:58:15,450
and I will thee requite.

753
00:58:15,643 --> 00:58:19,512
Ancient Pistol, I do partly
understand your meaning.

754
00:58:19,612 --> 00:58:23,188
Why, then,
rejoice therefore!

755
00:58:23,484 --> 00:58:26,679
'Tis not a thing
to rejoice at.

756
00:58:26,877 --> 00:58:30,040
Look you, if he
were my brother,

757
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:32,665
I would desire the duke
to do his good pleasure...

758
00:58:32,765 --> 00:58:35,796
and put him to execution.

759
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:39,026
Discipline ought to be used.

760
00:58:40,798 --> 00:58:42,748
Then die and be damned...

761
00:58:42,848 --> 00:58:47,450
and figo for thy friendship!

762
00:59:00,866 --> 00:59:03,616
How now, Fluellen,
comest thou from the bridge?

763
00:59:03,716 --> 00:59:05,311
Aye, so please your majesty.

764
00:59:05,411 --> 00:59:09,817
The duke of Exeter hath very
gallantly maintained the bridge.

765
00:59:10,275 --> 00:59:12,993
What men have you lost?

766
00:59:13,093 --> 00:59:15,960
I think the duke
hath lost never a man...

767
00:59:19,813 --> 00:59:23,641
but one that is like to be
executed for robbing a church.

768
00:59:24,742 --> 00:59:28,636
One Bardolph, if
your majesty know the man.

769
00:59:28,871 --> 00:59:33,124
His face is all bubukles and
whelks and knobs and flames of fire.

770
00:59:33,224 --> 00:59:35,205
His lips blows at his nose.

771
00:59:35,305 --> 00:59:38,849
'tis like a coal of fire...
sometimes blue, sometimes red.

772
00:59:40,746 --> 00:59:44,225
But his nose is executed
and his fire's out.

773
00:59:48,778 --> 00:59:50,022
Get up!

774
01:00:10,862 --> 01:00:12,357
Shh!

775
01:00:19,024 --> 01:00:20,649
Oh!

776
01:00:21,264 --> 01:00:23,568
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

777
01:00:33,427 --> 01:00:38,412
Do not, when thou art king,
hang a thief.

778
01:00:40,756 --> 01:00:42,349
No,

779
01:00:45,814 --> 01:00:47,537
thou shalt.

780
01:01:20,827 --> 01:01:24,153
We would have all such offenders
so cut off.

781
01:01:26,396 --> 01:01:28,409
We give express charge
that in our marches...

782
01:01:28,509 --> 01:01:32,314
through the country there be nothing
compelled from the villages,

783
01:01:32,414 --> 01:01:36,154
nothing taken but paid for,

784
01:01:37,213 --> 01:01:42,002
none of the French upbraided
or abused in disdainful language.

785
01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:47,001
For when lenity and cruelty
play for a kingdom,

786
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:53,782
the gentler gamester
is the soonest winner.

787
01:02:17,252 --> 01:02:20,258
Thus says my king,
"Say thou to Harry of England,

788
01:02:20,358 --> 01:02:22,371
"though we seemed dead,
we did but sleep.

789
01:02:22,471 --> 01:02:25,507
"Tell him we could have
rebuked him at Harflew.

790
01:02:25,607 --> 01:02:28,611
"Now we speak,
and our voice is imperial.

791
01:02:28,711 --> 01:02:31,748
"England shall
repent his folly.

792
01:02:31,848 --> 01:02:33,687
"Bid him, therefore,
consider of his ransom...

793
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:36,197
"which must proportion
the losses we have borne...

794
01:02:36,297 --> 01:02:39,878
"which in weight to re-answer
his pettiness would bow under.

795
01:02:39,978 --> 01:02:44,134
"To this add defiance,
and tell him, for conclusion,

796
01:02:44,234 --> 01:02:46,151
"he hath betrayed
his followers...

797
01:02:46,251 --> 01:02:49,118
whose condemnation
is pronounced."

798
01:02:49,738 --> 01:02:54,013
So far my king and master,
so much my office.

799
01:02:55,147 --> 01:02:58,025
- What is thy name?
- Montjoy.

800
01:02:58,125 --> 01:03:01,066
Thou dost thy office fairly.

801
01:03:01,166 --> 01:03:05,547
Turn thee back, and tell
thy king I do not seek him now,

802
01:03:05,647 --> 01:03:09,387
but could be willing to march on
to Calais without impeachment.

803
01:03:09,678 --> 01:03:12,396
Go, therefore,
tell thy master here I am.

804
01:03:12,496 --> 01:03:16,141
My ransom is this
frail and worthless trunk,

805
01:03:16,241 --> 01:03:19,085
my army but a weak
and sickly guard.

806
01:03:19,185 --> 01:03:22,190
Yet, God before,
tell him we will come on,

807
01:03:22,290 --> 01:03:26,959
though France himself and such
another neighbor stand in our way.

808
01:03:27,059 --> 01:03:29,071
So, Montjoy, fare you well.

809
01:03:29,171 --> 01:03:31,727
The sum of all our answer
is but this:

810
01:03:31,827 --> 01:03:35,568
We would not seek
a battle as we are,

811
01:03:35,858 --> 01:03:40,014
nor, as we are,
we say we will not shun it.

812
01:03:42,484 --> 01:03:43,946
So tell your master.

813
01:03:45,364 --> 01:03:46,826
I shall deliver so.

814
01:03:48,212 --> 01:03:50,797
Thanks to your majesty.

815
01:04:08,568 --> 01:04:10,645
I hope they will not
come upon us now.

816
01:04:10,745 --> 01:04:14,998
We are in god's hand, brother,
not in theirs.

817
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:30,777
March to the bridge.

818
01:04:31,358 --> 01:04:33,498
It now draws towards night.

819
01:04:33,598 --> 01:04:36,060
Beyond the river
we'll encamp ourselves...

820
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:37,752
and on tomorrow...

821
01:04:40,862 --> 01:04:44,058
bid them march away.

822
01:05:36,329 --> 01:05:39,174
Now entertain
conjecture of a time...

823
01:05:39,274 --> 01:05:42,151
when creeping murmur
and the poring dark...

824
01:05:42,251 --> 01:05:46,176
fills the wide vessel
of the universe.

825
01:05:46,826 --> 01:05:50,536
From camp to camp through
the foul womb of night...

826
01:05:50,636 --> 01:05:53,128
the hum of either army
stilly sounds...

827
01:05:53,228 --> 01:05:56,521
that the fixed sentinels
almost receive...

828
01:05:56,621 --> 01:05:59,303
the secret whispers
of each other's watch.

829
01:05:59,533 --> 01:06:01,026
Fire answers fire,

830
01:06:01,228 --> 01:06:03,306
and through their paly flames,

831
01:06:03,406 --> 01:06:06,218
each battle sees
the other's umbered face.

832
01:06:06,318 --> 01:06:09,098
Steed threatens steed
in high and boastful neighs,

833
01:06:09,198 --> 01:06:10,826
piercing the night's dull ear.

834
01:06:10,926 --> 01:06:13,064
And from the tents,

835
01:06:14,318 --> 01:06:16,813
the armorers,
accomplishing the knights,

836
01:06:16,913 --> 01:06:22,344
with busy hammers closing rivets up
give dreadful note of preparation.

837
01:06:22,896 --> 01:06:25,550
Proud of their numbers
and secure in soul,

838
01:06:25,650 --> 01:06:27,631
the confident
and over-lusty French...

839
01:06:27,731 --> 01:06:30,126
do the low-rated English
play at dice...

840
01:06:30,226 --> 01:06:33,967
and chide the cripple,
tardy-gaited night...

841
01:06:34,067 --> 01:06:39,913
who, like a foul and ugly witch,
doth limp so tediously away.

842
01:06:56,919 --> 01:07:00,299
I have the best armor
in the world.

843
01:07:01,208 --> 01:07:02,637
Would it were day.

844
01:07:02,744 --> 01:07:05,972
you have an excellent armor,
but let my horse have his due.

845
01:07:07,417 --> 01:07:10,198
It is the best horse of Europe.

846
01:07:12,698 --> 01:07:14,745
Will it never be morning?

847
01:07:16,730 --> 01:07:18,903
My lord of Orleans
and my lord High Constable,

848
01:07:19,003 --> 01:07:22,132
you talk of horse and armor?

849
01:07:22,299 --> 01:07:25,397
You are as well provided of both
as any prince in the world.

850
01:07:26,108 --> 01:07:27,865
I will not change my horse...

851
01:07:27,965 --> 01:07:31,443
for any that treads
but on four hooves.

852
01:07:32,284 --> 01:07:35,034
When I bestride him,
I soar.

853
01:07:35,134 --> 01:07:40,314
I am a hawk, and he is
pure air and fire!

854
01:07:40,510 --> 01:07:43,036
The dull elements of earth
and water never appear in him,

855
01:07:43,136 --> 01:07:47,452
but only impatient stillness
while his rider mounts him.

856
01:07:47,552 --> 01:07:52,602
Indeed, my lord, it is a most
absolute and excellent horse.

857
01:07:55,584 --> 01:07:58,462
My lord constable,
the armor in your tent tonight...

858
01:07:58,562 --> 01:08:00,030
Are those suns
or stars on it?

859
01:08:00,130 --> 01:08:02,398
Stars, Montjoy.

860
01:08:03,170 --> 01:08:05,120
Some of them will
fall tomorrow, I hope.

861
01:08:05,220 --> 01:08:08,065
And yet my sky
shall not want.

862
01:08:11,972 --> 01:08:14,142
Will it never be day?

863
01:08:16,164 --> 01:08:18,466
I will trot tomorrow a mile,

864
01:08:18,566 --> 01:08:21,731
and my way shall be paved
with English faces.

865
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:27,262
I will not say so, for fear I
should be faced out of my way.

866
01:08:34,791 --> 01:08:36,318
I'll go arm myself.

867
01:08:44,969 --> 01:08:49,447
The Dauphin longs for morning.
He longs to eat the English.

868
01:08:49,547 --> 01:08:51,336
I think he will eat
all he kills.

869
01:08:51,436 --> 01:08:55,656
He never did harm that I heard of.
Nor will do none tomorrow.

870
01:08:56,043 --> 01:08:59,653
Would it were day.

871
01:09:00,684 --> 01:09:04,610
Alas, poor Harry of England.

872
01:09:05,357 --> 01:09:08,811
He longs not for
the dawning as we do.

873
01:09:08,911 --> 01:09:12,139
If the English had any apprehension,
they would run away.

874
01:09:12,239 --> 01:09:13,351
Hmph.

875
01:09:13,902 --> 01:09:17,414
That island of England
breeds very valiant creatures.

876
01:09:25,169 --> 01:09:27,471
Now is it time to arm.

877
01:09:27,571 --> 01:09:29,615
Come, shall we about it?

878
01:09:29,715 --> 01:09:31,405
It is now 2:00.

879
01:09:31,891 --> 01:09:36,079
But let me see, by 10:00, we shall
have each a hundred Englishmen.

880
01:09:41,203 --> 01:09:44,177
The poor, condemned English,

881
01:09:44,277 --> 01:09:46,162
like sacrifices,

882
01:09:46,997 --> 01:09:50,162
by their watchful fires
sit patiently...

883
01:09:50,262 --> 01:09:54,962
and inly ruminate
the morning's danger.

884
01:10:04,471 --> 01:10:06,228
And their gesture sad,

885
01:10:06,328 --> 01:10:10,773
investing lank, lean cheeks
and war-worn coats,

886
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:14,319
presenteth them
unto the gazing moon...

887
01:10:14,969 --> 01:10:17,689
so many horrid ghosts.

888
01:10:20,922 --> 01:10:22,645
Ahh.

889
01:10:49,792 --> 01:10:51,134
Oh, now,

890
01:10:52,192 --> 01:10:56,283
who will behold the royal
captain of this ruined band,

891
01:10:56,641 --> 01:11:00,599
walking from watch to watch,
from tent to tent?

892
01:11:01,313 --> 01:11:05,407
Let him cry,
"Praise and glory on his head,"

893
01:11:05,507 --> 01:11:10,304
For forth he goes
and visits all his host.

894
01:11:10,404 --> 01:11:13,505
Bids them good morrow
with a modest smile...

895
01:11:13,605 --> 01:11:18,491
and calls them "Brothers,
friends and countrymen."

896
01:11:18,949 --> 01:11:22,403
A largesse universal,
like the sun...

897
01:11:22,503 --> 01:11:25,501
his liberal eye
doth give to everyone,

898
01:11:25,670 --> 01:11:27,328
thawing cold fear...

899
01:11:28,199 --> 01:11:31,107
that mean and gentle all...

900
01:11:31,207 --> 01:11:34,821
behold, as may
unworthiness define,

901
01:11:34,921 --> 01:11:38,148
a little touch of Harry
in the night.

902
01:11:39,304 --> 01:11:41,381
Good morrow, old
sir Thomas Erpingham.

903
01:11:41,481 --> 01:11:45,510
A good soft pillow for that good white head
were better than a churlish turf of France.

904
01:11:45,610 --> 01:11:49,415
Not so, my liege.
This lodging likes me better...

905
01:11:49,515 --> 01:11:52,808
since I may say,
"Now lie I like a king."

906
01:11:52,908 --> 01:11:56,932
Lend me thy cloak, Sir Thomas.

907
01:11:57,996 --> 01:12:00,489
Brothers both, commend me
to the princes in our camp.

908
01:12:00,589 --> 01:12:04,010
Do my good morrow to them, and
anon desire them all to my pavilion.

909
01:12:04,110 --> 01:12:05,221
We shall, my liege.

910
01:12:10,030 --> 01:12:13,197
Shall I attend your grace?
No, my good knight.

911
01:12:13,297 --> 01:12:16,642
I and my bosom
must debate a while,

912
01:12:17,007 --> 01:12:19,559
and then I would
no other company.

913
01:12:19,727 --> 01:12:23,653
The lord in heaven
bless thee, noble Harry.

914
01:12:29,041 --> 01:12:31,658
God have mercy, old heart.

915
01:12:32,114 --> 01:12:34,796
Thou speakest cheerfully.

916
01:12:43,827 --> 01:12:46,248
Qui va la?

917
01:12:46,901 --> 01:12:48,330
A friend.

918
01:12:49,236 --> 01:12:50,611
Discuss unto me.

919
01:12:51,958 --> 01:12:53,365
Art thou officer...

920
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:57,840
or art thou base,
common and popular?

921
01:12:58,134 --> 01:13:00,817
I am a gentleman of a company.

922
01:13:01,175 --> 01:13:04,756
Trailest thou
the puissant pike? Even so.

923
01:13:04,856 --> 01:13:09,014
What are you?
As good a gentleman as the emperor.

924
01:13:09,114 --> 01:13:11,981
Ah, then you are a better
than the king.

925
01:13:13,305 --> 01:13:18,061
The king's a bawcock
and a heart of gold,

926
01:13:18,235 --> 01:13:21,272
a lad of life,
an imp of fame,

927
01:13:21,372 --> 01:13:25,145
of parents good,
of fist most valiant.

928
01:13:26,651 --> 01:13:29,301
I kiss his dirty shoe,

929
01:13:29,564 --> 01:13:33,653
and from heartstring,
I love the lovely bully.

930
01:13:37,949 --> 01:13:39,061
What is thy name?

931
01:13:39,229 --> 01:13:43,131
Uh, Harry Le Roy.
Le Roy?

932
01:13:43,231 --> 01:13:45,140
A... a Cornish name?

933
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:47,352
No, I am a Welshman.

934
01:13:50,016 --> 01:13:52,989
Knowest thou Fluellen?
Aye.

935
01:13:53,089 --> 01:13:57,726
Tell him I'll knock his leek about
his pate upon Saint Davy's day.

936
01:13:57,826 --> 01:14:01,915
Do not wear your dagger in your cap
that day, lest he knock that about yours.

937
01:14:03,170 --> 01:14:04,282
Art thou his friend?

938
01:14:04,386 --> 01:14:06,011
And his kinsman too.

939
01:14:07,171 --> 01:14:09,824
The figo with thee then.
I thank you.

940
01:14:09,924 --> 01:14:11,003
God be with you.

941
01:14:11,971 --> 01:14:14,721
My name is Pistol called.

942
01:14:14,821 --> 01:14:17,667
It sorts well
with your fierceness.

943
01:14:23,942 --> 01:14:26,362
Captain Fluellen.
Shh!

944
01:14:29,063 --> 01:14:31,647
In the name of Jesus Christ,
speak lower.

945
01:14:36,744 --> 01:14:40,486
If you would take the pains but to
examine the wars of Pompey the great,

946
01:14:40,586 --> 01:14:46,398
you shall find that there is no Tiddle
Taddle nor Pibble Babble in Pompey's camp.

947
01:14:46,536 --> 01:14:49,350
The enemy is loud.
You hear him all night.

948
01:14:50,090 --> 01:14:53,544
If the enemy is an ass and
a fool and a prating coxcomb,

949
01:14:53,644 --> 01:14:55,848
is it meet that we should
also be an ass...

950
01:14:55,948 --> 01:15:00,419
and a fool and a prating coxcomb
in your conscience now?

951
01:15:01,772 --> 01:15:04,169
I will speak lower.

952
01:15:04,269 --> 01:15:07,234
I pray you and beseech you
that you will.

953
01:15:34,227 --> 01:15:35,601
Brother John Bates,

954
01:15:37,010 --> 01:15:39,920
Is not that the morning
which breaks yonder?

955
01:15:40,020 --> 01:15:41,230
I think it be,

956
01:15:41,619 --> 01:15:46,156
but we have no great cause
to desire the approach of day.

957
01:15:46,676 --> 01:15:49,358
We see yonder
the beginning of the day,

958
01:15:50,581 --> 01:15:52,949
but I think we shall
never see the end of it.

959
01:15:56,438 --> 01:16:00,500
Who goes there?
A friend.

960
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:02,292
Under what captain serve ya?

961
01:16:02,392 --> 01:16:05,903
Under Sir Thomas Erpingham.

962
01:16:10,904 --> 01:16:15,158
A good old commander
and a most kind gentleman.

963
01:16:16,153 --> 01:16:19,894
I pray ya, what thinks he
of our estate?

964
01:16:20,154 --> 01:16:23,096
Even as men
wrecked upon a sand...

965
01:16:23,196 --> 01:16:26,259
that look to be washed off
with the next tide.

966
01:16:26,683 --> 01:16:28,601
He hath not told
his thought to the king?

967
01:16:28,701 --> 01:16:32,212
No, nor it is not
meet he should.

968
01:16:32,541 --> 01:16:35,322
I think the king
is but a man as I am.

969
01:16:35,422 --> 01:16:38,587
The violet smells to him
as it doth to me.

970
01:16:38,687 --> 01:16:40,827
His ceremonies laid by,

971
01:16:40,927 --> 01:16:43,641
in his nakedness
he appears but a man.

972
01:16:43,743 --> 01:16:46,140
Therefore, when he sees
reason to fear, as we do,

973
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:49,213
his fears, out of doubt,
be of the same relish as ours are.

974
01:16:49,313 --> 01:16:51,933
He may show what
outward courage he will,

975
01:16:52,033 --> 01:16:54,046
but I believe as
cold a night as 'tis...

976
01:16:54,146 --> 01:16:57,213
that he could wish himself
in Thames up to the neck.

977
01:16:57,313 --> 01:17:01,206
And so I would he were,
and I by him.

978
01:17:01,634 --> 01:17:04,600
At all adventures,
so we were quit here.

979
01:17:05,058 --> 01:17:08,257
I think he would not wish himself
anywhere but where he is.

980
01:17:08,357 --> 01:17:10,973
Then I would
he were here alone.

981
01:17:13,028 --> 01:17:15,586
Methinks I could not die
anywhere so contented...

982
01:17:15,686 --> 01:17:17,570
as in the king's company,

983
01:17:17,670 --> 01:17:22,272
his cause being just
and his quarrel honorable.

984
01:17:22,565 --> 01:17:24,513
That's more than we know.

985
01:17:24,613 --> 01:17:26,592
Aye, and more than
we should seek after.

986
01:17:26,692 --> 01:17:29,215
We know enough if we know
we are the king's subject.

987
01:17:29,315 --> 01:17:32,575
If his cause be wrong,
our obedience to the king...

988
01:17:32,675 --> 01:17:35,420
wipes the crime of it
out of us.

989
01:17:37,888 --> 01:17:39,901
But if the cause be not good,

990
01:17:40,001 --> 01:17:43,708
the king himself hath
a heavy reckoning to make.

991
01:17:44,062 --> 01:17:46,330
And all those legs
and arms and heads...

992
01:17:46,430 --> 01:17:47,962
chopped off in the battle...

993
01:17:48,062 --> 01:17:51,928
will join together at
the latter day and cry all,

994
01:17:52,028 --> 01:17:55,603
"we died at such a place."

995
01:17:56,826 --> 01:18:00,654
Some swearing,
some crying for a surgeon,

996
01:18:00,793 --> 01:18:04,533
some upon their wives
left poor behind them,

997
01:18:04,633 --> 01:18:06,996
some upon the debts they owe,

998
01:18:07,096 --> 01:18:10,027
some upon their children
rawly left.

999
01:18:15,253 --> 01:18:18,001
I'm afeared
there are few die well...

1000
01:18:18,101 --> 01:18:19,792
that die in a battle...

1001
01:18:19,892 --> 01:18:23,215
for how can they charitably
dispose of anything...

1002
01:18:23,315 --> 01:18:26,606
when blood is their argument?

1003
01:18:27,729 --> 01:18:31,276
Now if these men
do not die well,

1004
01:18:31,376 --> 01:18:36,194
it will be a black matter for
the king that led them to it.

1005
01:18:36,845 --> 01:18:40,202
So if a son that is by his father
sent about merchandise...

1006
01:18:40,302 --> 01:18:42,633
do sinfully miscarry
upon the sea,

1007
01:18:42,733 --> 01:18:45,031
the imputation of
his wickedness, by your rule,

1008
01:18:45,131 --> 01:18:48,327
should be imposed upon
the father that sent him?

1009
01:18:48,427 --> 01:18:49,734
But this is not so.

1010
01:18:50,025 --> 01:18:53,764
The king is not bound to answer the
particular endings of his soldiers...

1011
01:18:53,864 --> 01:18:56,325
nor the father of his son,

1012
01:18:56,425 --> 01:19:00,317
for they purpose not their deaths
when they purpose their services.

1013
01:19:01,381 --> 01:19:05,762
Besides, there is no king,
be his cause never so spotless,

1014
01:19:05,862 --> 01:19:10,430
can try it out with
all unspotted soldiers.

1015
01:19:11,555 --> 01:19:14,366
Every subject's duty
is the king's,

1016
01:19:14,466 --> 01:19:19,612
but every subject's soul
is his own.

1017
01:19:26,206 --> 01:19:27,612
'Tis certain.

1018
01:19:28,573 --> 01:19:32,313
Eevery man that dies ill,
the ill upon his own head.

1019
01:19:32,413 --> 01:19:35,192
The king is not to answer it.

1020
01:19:35,292 --> 01:19:37,432
I do not desire
he should answer for me.

1021
01:19:37,532 --> 01:19:41,173
Yet I determine
to fight lustily for him.

1022
01:19:42,136 --> 01:19:44,405
I myself heard the king say
he would not be ransomed.

1023
01:19:44,505 --> 01:19:48,148
Aye, he said so
to make us fight cheerfully.

1024
01:19:48,248 --> 01:19:51,250
But when our throats are cut, he may
be ransomed, and we ne'er the wiser.

1025
01:19:51,350 --> 01:19:54,929
If I live to see it,
I'll never trust his word after.

1026
01:19:55,029 --> 01:19:56,456
You pay him then!

1027
01:20:00,434 --> 01:20:03,497
You'll never trust
his word after?

1028
01:20:04,241 --> 01:20:07,245
Come. 'tis a foolish saying.

1029
01:20:07,345 --> 01:20:09,484
Your reproof
is something too round.

1030
01:20:09,584 --> 01:20:11,609
I should be angry with you
if time were convenient.

1031
01:20:11,709 --> 01:20:14,890
Let it be a quarrel between us,
if you live!

1032
01:20:15,662 --> 01:20:17,483
Be friends,
you English fools! Be friends!

1033
01:20:17,583 --> 01:20:19,849
We have French quarrels enough!

1034
01:20:39,239 --> 01:20:40,415
Upon the king.

1035
01:20:41,574 --> 01:20:46,306
Let us our lives,
our souls, our debts,

1036
01:20:46,629 --> 01:20:49,758
our careful wives,
our children...

1037
01:20:50,178 --> 01:20:53,209
and our sins lay on the king.

1038
01:20:53,634 --> 01:20:55,324
We must bear all.

1039
01:20:56,481 --> 01:20:59,164
Oh, hard condition.

1040
01:21:00,704 --> 01:21:03,099
Twin-born with greatness,

1041
01:21:03,199 --> 01:21:06,458
subject to the breath
of every fool.

1042
01:21:06,813 --> 01:21:09,753
What infinite heart's ease
must kings neglect...

1043
01:21:09,853 --> 01:21:12,403
that private men enjoy?

1044
01:21:12,827 --> 01:21:16,536
And what have kings
that privates have not too...

1045
01:21:16,636 --> 01:21:18,292
save ceremony?

1046
01:21:19,385 --> 01:21:23,060
And what art thou,
thou idle ceremony?

1047
01:21:24,088 --> 01:21:28,019
What drinks thou oft instead of
homage sweet but poison flattery?

1048
01:21:28,119 --> 01:21:33,199
Oh, be sick, great greatness,
and bid thy ceremony give thee cure.

1049
01:21:33,589 --> 01:21:36,849
Canst thou, when thou
commandest the beggar's knee,

1050
01:21:36,949 --> 01:21:39,499
command the health of it?

1051
01:21:47,281 --> 01:21:50,922
No, thou proud dream,

1052
01:21:51,311 --> 01:21:56,011
that playest so subtly
with a king's repose.

1053
01:21:56,749 --> 01:21:59,846
I am a king that find thee,

1054
01:22:00,269 --> 01:22:01,697
and I know...

1055
01:22:04,716 --> 01:22:08,296
'tis not the balm,
the scepter and the ball,

1056
01:22:08,396 --> 01:22:11,782
the sword, the mace,
the crown imperial,

1057
01:22:11,882 --> 01:22:15,397
the intertissued robe
of gold and pearl,

1058
01:22:15,497 --> 01:22:18,243
the farced title
running fore the king,

1059
01:22:18,343 --> 01:22:21,666
the throne he sits on...

1060
01:22:21,766 --> 01:22:24,034
nor the tide of pomp...

1061
01:22:24,134 --> 01:22:27,393
that beats upon the high shore
of this world.

1062
01:22:27,493 --> 01:22:32,159
No, not all these,
thrice-gorgeous ceremony,

1063
01:22:32,610 --> 01:22:35,870
not all these,
laid in bed majestical,

1064
01:22:35,970 --> 01:22:39,862
can sleep so soundly...

1065
01:22:40,033 --> 01:22:42,813
as the wretched slave,

1066
01:22:43,103 --> 01:22:47,322
Who, with a body filled and
vacant mind, gets him to rest,

1067
01:22:47,454 --> 01:22:49,593
crammed with
distressful bread,

1068
01:22:49,693 --> 01:22:52,664
never sees horrid night,
the child of hell,

1069
01:22:52,764 --> 01:22:54,808
but like a lackey,
from the rise to the set...

1070
01:22:54,908 --> 01:22:57,111
sweats in the eye
of Phoebus...

1071
01:22:57,211 --> 01:23:00,246
and all night sleeps...

1072
01:23:00,346 --> 01:23:01,904
in Elysium.

1073
01:23:03,161 --> 01:23:06,645
Next day after dawn, doth rise
and help Hyperion to his horse...

1074
01:23:06,745 --> 01:23:09,428
and follows so
the ever-running year...

1075
01:23:09,528 --> 01:23:12,466
with profitable labor
to his grave.

1076
01:23:12,566 --> 01:23:17,384
And but for ceremony...

1077
01:23:18,675 --> 01:23:20,103
such a wretch,

1078
01:23:20,692 --> 01:23:23,023
winding up days of toil...

1079
01:23:23,123 --> 01:23:26,153
and nights with sleep...

1080
01:23:27,664 --> 01:23:31,403
had the forehand
and vantage...

1081
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:34,759
of a king.

1082
01:23:39,053 --> 01:23:42,057
My lord, your nobles,
jealous of your absence,

1083
01:23:42,157 --> 01:23:45,122
seek through the camp
to find you.

1084
01:23:46,986 --> 01:23:48,229
Good old knight,

1085
01:23:49,353 --> 01:23:52,133
Collect them all together
at my tent.

1086
01:23:52,233 --> 01:23:54,054
I'll be before thee.

1087
01:23:58,982 --> 01:24:01,890
O God of battles,
steel my soldiers' hearts.

1088
01:24:01,990 --> 01:24:03,779
Possess them not with fear.

1089
01:24:03,879 --> 01:24:05,985
Take from them now
their sense of reckoning...

1090
01:24:06,085 --> 01:24:08,896
if the opposed numbers
pluck their hearts from them.

1091
01:24:08,996 --> 01:24:12,703
Not today, o God,
oh, not today.

1092
01:24:12,834 --> 01:24:16,126
Think not upon the fault my
father made encompassing the crown.

1093
01:24:16,226 --> 01:24:18,462
I Richard's body
have interred new...

1094
01:24:18,562 --> 01:24:21,053
and on it have bestowed
more contrite tears...

1095
01:24:21,153 --> 01:24:23,581
than from it issued
forced drops of blood.

1096
01:24:23,681 --> 01:24:26,363
Five hundred poor
I have in yearly pay...

1097
01:24:26,463 --> 01:24:28,155
who twice a day
their withered hands...

1098
01:24:28,255 --> 01:24:30,490
hold up toward heaven
to pardon blood.

1099
01:24:30,590 --> 01:24:33,209
And I have built
two chantries...

1100
01:24:33,309 --> 01:24:37,048
where the sad and solemn priests
sing still for Richard's soul.

1101
01:24:37,148 --> 01:24:38,804
More will I do...

1102
01:24:39,770 --> 01:24:43,215
though all that I can do...

1103
01:24:43,609 --> 01:24:44,949
is nothing worth...

1104
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:49,203
since my penitence comes,
after all,

1105
01:24:49,303 --> 01:24:51,984
imploring pardon.

1106
01:24:54,613 --> 01:24:58,058
My liege!
My brother Gloucester's voice.

1107
01:24:58,482 --> 01:25:00,304
I know thy errand.

1108
01:25:01,617 --> 01:25:03,504
I will go with thee.

1109
01:25:05,456 --> 01:25:08,716
The day, my friends,

1110
01:25:10,096 --> 01:25:12,779
and all things...

1111
01:25:13,775 --> 01:25:15,051
stay...

1112
01:25:16,558 --> 01:25:17,834
for me.

1113
01:25:37,831 --> 01:25:42,017
Hark how our steeds
for present service neigh.

1114
01:25:42,215 --> 01:25:45,058
Mount them and make incision
in their hides...

1115
01:25:45,158 --> 01:25:48,673
that their hot blood
may spin in English eyes.

1116
01:25:48,773 --> 01:25:52,352
Do but behold
yon poor and starved band.

1117
01:25:52,452 --> 01:25:55,070
Your fair show shall
suck away their souls,

1118
01:25:55,170 --> 01:25:58,270
leaving them but
the shales and husks of men.

1119
01:25:58,370 --> 01:26:01,149
There is not work enough
for all our hands.

1120
01:26:01,249 --> 01:26:03,803
Why do you stay so long,
my lords of france?

1121
01:26:03,903 --> 01:26:08,122
Yon island carrions, desperate of their
bones, ill-favoredly become the morning field.

1122
01:26:08,222 --> 01:26:12,048
They have said their prayers,
and they stay for death.

1123
01:26:13,180 --> 01:26:17,520
A very little little let us do,
and all is done.

1124
01:26:17,722 --> 01:26:21,686
Then let the trumpets sound the
tucket sonance and the note to mount...

1125
01:26:21,786 --> 01:26:25,333
for our approach will
so much dare the field...

1126
01:26:25,433 --> 01:26:30,001
that England shall crouch down
in fear... and yield!

1127
01:26:44,306 --> 01:26:45,646
Where is the king?

1128
01:26:45,969 --> 01:26:49,065
The king himself has rode
to view their battle.

1129
01:26:56,910 --> 01:27:00,770
Of fighting men,
they have full threescore thousand.

1130
01:27:01,037 --> 01:27:06,248
That's five to one.
Besides, they are all fresh.

1131
01:27:06,348 --> 01:27:07,775
'Tis a fearful odds.

1132
01:27:08,298 --> 01:27:13,413
Oh, that we now had here but one ten
thousand of those men in England...

1133
01:27:13,513 --> 01:27:15,301
That do no work today.

1134
01:27:15,401 --> 01:27:20,065
What's he that wishes so?
My cousin Westmoreland?

1135
01:27:23,333 --> 01:27:25,055
No, my fair cousin.

1136
01:27:26,083 --> 01:27:31,071
If we are marked to die, we are
enough to do our country loss.

1137
01:27:31,171 --> 01:27:34,109
And if to live,
the fewer men,

1138
01:27:34,209 --> 01:27:37,213
The greater share of honor.

1139
01:27:37,313 --> 01:27:41,881
God's will, I pray thee,
wish not one man more.

1140
01:27:43,358 --> 01:27:46,937
Rather, proclaim it,
Westmoreland, through my host,

1141
01:27:47,037 --> 01:27:49,912
that he which hath
no stomach to this fight...

1142
01:27:50,012 --> 01:27:51,352
let him depart.

1143
01:27:52,537 --> 01:27:54,423
His passport shall be made...

1144
01:27:54,523 --> 01:27:57,718
and crowns for convoy
put into his purse.

1145
01:27:57,818 --> 01:28:00,085
We would not die
in that man's company...

1146
01:28:00,185 --> 01:28:03,662
that fears his fellowship
to die with us.

1147
01:28:04,630 --> 01:28:08,108
This day is called
the feast of Crispian.

1148
01:28:08,725 --> 01:28:12,464
He that outlives this day
and comes safe home...

1149
01:28:12,564 --> 01:28:15,983
will stand at tiptoe
when this day is named...

1150
01:28:16,083 --> 01:28:18,830
and rouse him
at the name of Crispian.

1151
01:28:18,930 --> 01:28:21,614
He that shall see this day
and live old age...

1152
01:28:21,714 --> 01:28:24,716
will yearly, on the vigil,
feast his neighbors...

1153
01:28:24,816 --> 01:28:28,555
and say, "tomorrow
is Saint Crispin's."

1154
01:28:28,814 --> 01:28:31,210
Then will he strip his sleeve
and show his scars...

1155
01:28:31,310 --> 01:28:36,543
and say, "these wounds
I had on Crispin's day."

1156
01:28:38,186 --> 01:28:39,712
Old men forget,

1157
01:28:40,649 --> 01:28:44,037
yet all shall be forgot but
he'll remember with advantages...

1158
01:28:44,137 --> 01:28:46,372
what feats he did that day.

1159
01:28:46,472 --> 01:28:50,307
Then shall our names, familiar
in their mouths as household words...

1160
01:28:50,407 --> 01:28:52,770
Harry the king,
Bedford and Exeter,

1161
01:28:52,870 --> 01:28:55,105
Warwick and Talbot,
Salisbury and Gloucester...

1162
01:28:55,205 --> 01:28:58,688
be in their flowing cups
freshly remembered.

1163
01:28:58,788 --> 01:29:02,271
This story shall
a good man teach his son.

1164
01:29:02,371 --> 01:29:05,246
Crispin Crispian
shall ne'er go by,

1165
01:29:05,346 --> 01:29:09,466
from this day to
the ending of the world,

1166
01:29:09,631 --> 01:29:13,010
but we in it
shall be remembered.

1167
01:29:13,150 --> 01:29:14,807
We few,

1168
01:29:17,948 --> 01:29:20,151
we happy few,

1169
01:29:20,572 --> 01:29:22,393
we band of brothers.

1170
01:29:22,651 --> 01:29:26,134
For he today that sheds his
blood with me shall be my brother.

1171
01:29:26,234 --> 01:29:29,973
Be he ne'er so vile,
this day shall gentle his condition.

1172
01:29:30,073 --> 01:29:32,533
And gentlemen in England
now abed...

1173
01:29:32,633 --> 01:29:36,403
shall think themselves accursed
they were not here...

1174
01:29:36,503 --> 01:29:39,251
and hold their manhoods cheap...

1175
01:29:39,351 --> 01:29:42,609
whiles any speaks
that fought with us...

1176
01:29:42,709 --> 01:29:46,001
upon Saint Cispin's day!

1177
01:29:50,961 --> 01:29:54,316
My sovereign lord!
Bestow yourself with speed!

1178
01:29:54,416 --> 01:29:56,113
The French are bravely
in their battle set...

1179
01:29:56,213 --> 01:29:58,987
and will with all expedience
march upon us!

1180
01:29:59,087 --> 01:30:02,378
All things are ready
if our minds be so!

1181
01:30:02,478 --> 01:30:04,649
Perish the man whose mind
is backward now.

1182
01:30:04,749 --> 01:30:07,112
Thou dost not wish more help
from England, coz?

1183
01:30:07,212 --> 01:30:09,063
God's will, my liege.

1184
01:30:09,163 --> 01:30:13,251
You and I alone, without more help,
could fight this royal battle.

1185
01:30:13,737 --> 01:30:15,045
You know your places!

1186
01:30:15,145 --> 01:30:18,174
God be with you all!

1187
01:30:25,988 --> 01:30:28,385
Once more I come to know
of thee, if for they ransom,

1188
01:30:28,485 --> 01:30:32,224
thou wilt now compound before
thy most assured overthrow.

1189
01:30:32,930 --> 01:30:35,742
Who hast sent thee now?
The constable of France.

1190
01:30:35,842 --> 01:30:39,549
I pray thee bear
my former answer back.

1191
01:30:39,649 --> 01:30:44,091
Bid them achieve me
and then sell my bones!

1192
01:30:44,191 --> 01:30:47,770
Good god, why should they
mock poor fellows thus?

1193
01:30:47,870 --> 01:30:50,553
Let me speak proudly.

1194
01:30:50,653 --> 01:30:53,849
Tell the constable we are but
warriors for the working day.

1195
01:30:53,949 --> 01:30:55,895
Our gayness and our gilt
are all besmirched...

1196
01:30:55,995 --> 01:30:58,551
with rainy marching
in the painful field,

1197
01:30:58,651 --> 01:31:02,740
but by the mass,
our hearts are in the trim.

1198
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:05,779
Herald,
save thou thy labor.

1199
01:31:05,879 --> 01:31:10,283
Come thou no more for ransom,
gentle herald.

1200
01:31:10,548 --> 01:31:13,937
They shall have none,
I swear,

1201
01:31:14,037 --> 01:31:17,519
but these my joints!

1202
01:31:17,619 --> 01:31:21,509
Which, if they have
as I shall leave of them,

1203
01:31:21,873 --> 01:31:25,646
shall yield them little.

1204
01:31:28,239 --> 01:31:29,383
Tell the constable.

1205
01:31:30,029 --> 01:31:31,370
I shall, king Harry.

1206
01:31:32,908 --> 01:31:35,305
And so fare thee well.

1207
01:31:35,405 --> 01:31:38,467
Thou never shalt
hear herald anymore.

1208
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:48,037
My lord,
most humbly on my knee,

1209
01:31:48,137 --> 01:31:51,069
I beg the leading
of the vaward.

1210
01:31:51,558 --> 01:31:54,720
Take it, brave York.

1211
01:31:57,349 --> 01:32:01,339
Now, soldiers, march away,

1212
01:32:01,763 --> 01:32:04,631
and how thou pleasest, God,

1213
01:32:05,474 --> 01:32:07,261
dispose the day.

1214
01:32:25,145 --> 01:32:27,158
And so our scene must
to the battle fly...

1215
01:32:27,258 --> 01:32:29,333
where, oh, for pity
we shall much disgrace...

1216
01:32:29,433 --> 01:32:31,860
with four or five
most vile and ragged foils...

1217
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:34,227
right ill-disposed
in brawl ridiculous...

1218
01:32:34,327 --> 01:32:37,194
the name of Agincourt.

1219
01:33:37,601 --> 01:33:38,844
Ready!

1220
01:33:59,128 --> 01:34:00,305
Ready!

1221
01:34:03,544 --> 01:34:05,494
Fire!

1222
01:37:37,805 --> 01:37:41,034
Why, all our ranks are broke.

1223
01:37:41,134 --> 01:37:42,597
O perdurable shame!

1224
01:37:43,025 --> 01:37:46,353
Shame and eternal shame.

1225
01:37:46,453 --> 01:37:48,721
Nothing but shame.

1226
01:37:55,290 --> 01:37:59,350
Let us die in arms.
Once more back again.

1227
01:37:59,485 --> 01:38:02,577
We are enough yet living in the field
to smother up the English in our throngs...

1228
01:38:02,677 --> 01:38:04,094
if any order
might be thought upon.

1229
01:38:04,194 --> 01:38:06,144
The devil take order now!

1230
01:38:06,244 --> 01:38:08,154
I'll to the throng!

1231
01:38:08,709 --> 01:38:13,632
Let life be short!
Else shame will be too long!

1232
01:38:25,841 --> 01:38:28,817
Well have we done,
thrice-valiant countrymen!

1233
01:38:28,917 --> 01:38:30,378
Yet all's not done!

1234
01:38:30,741 --> 01:38:33,334
Yet keep the French the field!

1235
01:41:39,332 --> 01:41:42,529
Kill the boys and the luggage.

1236
01:41:43,688 --> 01:41:47,748
'Tis expressly against
the law of arms.

1237
01:41:50,221 --> 01:41:54,414
'Tis as errant a piece
of knavery, mark you now,

1238
01:41:54,514 --> 01:41:56,423
as can be offered.

1239
01:41:58,676 --> 01:42:02,899
In your conscience,
now, is it not?

1240
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:07,985
'Tis certain there's
not a boy left alive.

1241
01:42:19,459 --> 01:42:23,043
I was not angry
since I came to France!

1242
01:42:23,143 --> 01:42:24,604
Until this instant!

1243
01:42:24,807 --> 01:42:27,938
Here comes the herald
of the French, my liege.

1244
01:42:33,711 --> 01:42:37,519
What means this, herald?
Huh? Com'st thou again for ransom?

1245
01:42:37,619 --> 01:42:38,960
No! Great king!

1246
01:42:39,539 --> 01:42:41,425
I come to thee
for charitable license...

1247
01:42:41,525 --> 01:42:44,692
that we may wander o'er this
bloody field to book our dead...

1248
01:42:44,792 --> 01:42:46,037
and then to bury them.

1249
01:42:46,137 --> 01:42:49,944
To sort our nobles
from our common men.

1250
01:42:50,171 --> 01:42:52,026
For many of our princes...
woe the while...

1251
01:42:52,126 --> 01:42:55,322
Lie drowned and soaked
in mercenary blood.

1252
01:42:56,384 --> 01:42:59,583
O, give us leave, great king,
to view the field in safety...

1253
01:42:59,683 --> 01:43:02,530
and to dispose
of their dead bodies.

1254
01:43:02,789 --> 01:43:04,612
I tell thee truly, herald,

1255
01:43:04,712 --> 01:43:09,185
I know not if the day
be ours or no.

1256
01:43:11,404 --> 01:43:14,123
The day is yours.

1257
01:43:24,630 --> 01:43:26,453
Praised be god...

1258
01:43:27,768 --> 01:43:30,964
and not our strength for it.

1259
01:43:56,334 --> 01:43:59,203
What is this castle called...

1260
01:43:59,343 --> 01:44:00,806
that stands hard by?

1261
01:44:01,970 --> 01:44:04,139
They call it Agincourt.

1262
01:44:05,588 --> 01:44:06,799
Then call we this...

1263
01:44:08,503 --> 01:44:11,470
the field of Agincourt...

1264
01:44:12,410 --> 01:44:17,529
fought on the day
of Crispin Crispianus.

1265
01:44:32,585 --> 01:44:35,208
Your grandfather
of famous memory,

1266
01:44:35,308 --> 01:44:37,379
an't please your majesty,

1267
01:44:39,118 --> 01:44:43,790
and your great-uncle, Edward,
the black prince of Wales,

1268
01:44:44,114 --> 01:44:46,503
as I have read
in the Chronicles,

1269
01:44:47,828 --> 01:44:50,996
fought a most brave battle
here in France.

1270
01:44:51,096 --> 01:44:52,273
They did, Fluellen.

1271
01:44:52,439 --> 01:44:55,188
Y-your majesty says very true.

1272
01:44:58,685 --> 01:45:02,460
If your majesty
is remembered of it,

1273
01:45:02,945 --> 01:45:08,314
the Welshmen did good service in
a garden where leeks did grow,

1274
01:45:08,453 --> 01:45:12,005
wearing leeks in their Monmouth caps,
which, as your majesty know,

1275
01:45:12,105 --> 01:45:15,300
to this hour is
an honorable badge of service.

1276
01:45:17,195 --> 01:45:19,370
And I do believe your majesty
takes no scorn...

1277
01:45:19,470 --> 01:45:22,605
to wear the leek
upon St. Davy's day.

1278
01:45:22,705 --> 01:45:25,933
I wear it for
a memorable honor,

1279
01:45:26,515 --> 01:45:30,924
for I am Welsh, you know,
good my countryman.

1280
01:45:40,927 --> 01:45:42,780
All the water in Wye...

1281
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:47,517
cannot wash your majesty's Welsh blood
out of your body, I can tell you that.

1282
01:45:47,651 --> 01:45:51,427
God bless it and preserve it, so long
as it pleases his grace...

1283
01:45:51,527 --> 01:45:52,771
and his majesty too.

1284
01:45:53,127 --> 01:45:57,480
Thanks, good my countryman.
By jeshu, I am your majesty's countryman!

1285
01:45:57,580 --> 01:46:02,282
I care not who know it.
I shall confess it to all the world!

1286
01:46:04,559 --> 01:46:07,788
And I need not be ashamed
of your majesty, praised be god,

1287
01:46:08,531 --> 01:46:13,289
so long as your majesty
is an honest man.

1288
01:46:15,384 --> 01:46:16,948
God keep me so.

1289
01:46:25,201 --> 01:46:29,583
Doth fortune play
the housewife with me now?

1290
01:46:31,745 --> 01:46:34,781
News I have
that my Nell is dead.

1291
01:46:36,462 --> 01:46:38,156
Tsk!

1292
01:46:38,578 --> 01:46:40,109
Old do I wax,

1293
01:46:40,856 --> 01:46:45,818
and from my weary limbs
honor is cudgeled.

1294
01:46:47,144 --> 01:46:48,259
Well,

1295
01:46:49,326 --> 01:46:50,736
bawd I'll turn...

1296
01:46:52,246 --> 01:46:57,623
and something lean
to cutpurse of quick hand.

1297
01:47:00,555 --> 01:47:03,241
To England will I steal,

1298
01:47:03,763 --> 01:47:08,146
and there I'll... steal.

1299
01:47:13,741 --> 01:47:16,264
herald, are
the dead numbered?

1300
01:47:17,236 --> 01:47:19,540
Here is the number
of the slaughtered French.

1301
01:47:31,224 --> 01:47:35,037
This note doth tell me of...

1302
01:47:37,159 --> 01:47:39,368
10,000 French...

1303
01:47:40,463 --> 01:47:43,117
that in the field
lie slain.

1304
01:47:43,479 --> 01:47:46,974
Of princes
in this number, 126.

1305
01:47:47,074 --> 01:47:52,998
Added to these, of knights,
esquires and gallant gentlemen,

1306
01:47:53,745 --> 01:47:57,876
eight thousand
and four hundred...

1307
01:47:58,719 --> 01:48:00,962
of the which
five hundred...

1308
01:48:01,062 --> 01:48:04,261
were but yesterday
dubbed knights.

1309
01:48:06,482 --> 01:48:09,518
Here was a royal
fellowship of death.

1310
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,470
Where is the number
of our English dead?

1311
01:48:19,315 --> 01:48:23,150
"Edward, the duke of York,

1312
01:48:24,736 --> 01:48:27,105
"the earl of Suffolk,

1313
01:48:28,074 --> 01:48:30,021
"Sir Richard Ketly,

1314
01:48:32,468 --> 01:48:35,999
Davy Gam, esquire."

1315
01:48:39,186 --> 01:48:40,593
None else of name...

1316
01:48:40,980 --> 01:48:43,848
and of all other men...

1317
01:48:44,917 --> 01:48:48,563
but five-and-twenty.

1318
01:48:54,873 --> 01:48:55,986
'Tis wonderful.

1319
01:48:58,842 --> 01:49:00,086
Come.

1320
01:49:01,371 --> 01:49:03,545
Go we in procession
to the village...

1321
01:49:04,779 --> 01:49:06,971
and be it death proclaimed
through our host...

1322
01:49:07,071 --> 01:49:08,412
to boast of this...

1323
01:49:08,639 --> 01:49:12,349
or take that praise
from God which is his only.

1324
01:49:13,024 --> 01:49:15,262
Is it not lawful,
an't please your majesty,

1325
01:49:15,362 --> 01:49:17,663
to tell how many
is killed?

1326
01:49:17,763 --> 01:49:19,071
Aye, captain,

1327
01:49:19,875 --> 01:49:21,880
but with this acknowledgement:

1328
01:49:22,562 --> 01:49:24,122
That God fought...

1329
01:49:29,103 --> 01:49:30,563
for us.

1330
01:49:32,899 --> 01:49:34,476
Yes, my conscience.

1331
01:49:36,870 --> 01:49:38,817
He did us great good.

1332
01:49:41,133 --> 01:49:44,101
Do we all holy rites.

1333
01:49:44,754 --> 01:49:47,781
Let there be sung
non nobisandte deum.

1334
01:49:48,346 --> 01:49:51,403
The dead with charity
enclosed in clay.

1335
01:49:52,259 --> 01:49:54,029
And then to Calais...

1336
01:49:54,537 --> 01:49:56,493
and to England then,

1337
01:49:58,011 --> 01:50:01,518
where ne'er from
France arrived...

1338
01:50:01,983 --> 01:50:04,260
more happy men.

Unto our brother France,
health and fair time of day.

1378
01:54:40,352 --> 01:54:43,903
Joy and good wishes to our most fair
and princely cousin Katherine.

1379
01:54:44,003 --> 01:54:46,144
And as a branch and member
of this royalty...

1380
01:54:46,244 --> 01:54:48,288
by whom this great assembly
is contrived,

1381
01:54:48,388 --> 01:54:50,529
we do salute you,
duke of Burgundy.

1382
01:54:50,629 --> 01:54:53,954
And, princes French and peers,

1383
01:54:54,054 --> 01:54:55,995
health to you all.

1384
01:54:58,182 --> 01:55:03,814
Right joyous are we to behold your
face, most worthy brother England.

1385
01:55:03,914 --> 01:55:05,123
Fairly met.

1386
01:55:06,762 --> 01:55:10,656
So are you,
princes English, every one.

1387
01:55:19,407 --> 01:55:23,367
My duty to you both,
on equal love,

1388
01:55:23,825 --> 01:55:26,213
great kings of France...

1389
01:55:26,321 --> 01:55:27,499
and England.

1390
01:55:31,697 --> 01:55:35,758
Since that my office
hath so far prevailed,

1391
01:55:35,858 --> 01:55:39,758
that face to face and royal
eye to eye you have congreeted...

1392
01:55:39,858 --> 01:55:44,015
let it not disgrace me if I
demand before this royal view...

1393
01:55:44,115 --> 01:55:47,055
why that the naked,
poor and mangled peace...

1394
01:55:47,155 --> 01:55:50,351
should not in this best
garden of the world,

1395
01:55:50,451 --> 01:55:54,824
our fertile France,
put up her lovely visage?

1396
01:55:55,922 --> 01:55:56,922
Alas,

1397
01:55:57,810 --> 01:56:00,911
she hath from France
too long been chased,

1398
01:56:01,011 --> 01:56:04,488
and all her husbandry
doth lie on heaps,

1399
01:56:04,722 --> 01:56:08,332
corrupting in
its own fertility.

1400
01:56:09,170 --> 01:56:12,847
And as our vineyards,
fallows, meads and hedges,

1401
01:56:12,947 --> 01:56:15,855
defective in their natures,
grow to wildness,

1402
01:56:15,955 --> 01:56:20,912
even so our houses and ourselves,
our children have lost...

1403
01:56:21,012 --> 01:56:23,152
or do not learn
for want of time...

1404
01:56:23,252 --> 01:56:25,904
those sciences which
should become our country,

1405
01:56:26,004 --> 01:56:30,576
but grow like savages,
as soldiers will...

1406
01:56:30,676 --> 01:56:33,584
that nothing do
but meditate on blood...

1407
01:56:33,684 --> 01:56:38,384
to swearing and stern looks,
diffused attire,

1408
01:56:38,484 --> 01:56:41,711
and everything that seems...

1409
01:56:42,260 --> 01:56:44,016
unnatural.

1410
01:56:45,748 --> 01:56:48,881
And my speech entreats
that I may know...

1411
01:56:48,981 --> 01:56:51,121
the let why gentle peace...

1412
01:56:51,221 --> 01:56:53,905
should not expel
these inconveniences...

1413
01:56:54,005 --> 01:56:59,305
and bless us with
her former qualities.

1414
01:57:01,301 --> 01:57:04,818
If, duke of Burgundy,
you would the peace...

1415
01:57:04,918 --> 01:57:08,145
whose want gives growth to the
imperfections which you have cited,

1416
01:57:08,245 --> 01:57:10,194
then you must buy
that peace...

1417
01:57:10,294 --> 01:57:14,770
with full accord
to all our just demands.

1418
01:57:14,870 --> 01:57:19,506
I have but with
a cursorary eye...

1419
01:57:19,606 --> 01:57:22,322
o'erglanced the articles.

1420
01:57:22,422 --> 01:57:25,681
Pleaseth your grace to appoint
some of your council...

1421
01:57:25,781 --> 01:57:28,305
to sit with us once more...

1422
01:57:28,405 --> 01:57:31,122
we will suddenly pass...

1423
01:57:31,222 --> 01:57:34,514
our accept
and peremptory answer.

1424
01:57:34,965 --> 01:57:36,175
Brother, we shall.

1425
01:57:38,742 --> 01:57:41,683
Yet leave
our cousin Katherine...

1426
01:57:41,783 --> 01:57:43,058
here with us.

1427
01:57:45,749 --> 01:57:49,107
She is our capital demand...

1428
01:57:49,207 --> 01:57:52,750
comprised within
the fore-rank of our articles.

1429
01:57:58,134 --> 01:57:59,563
She hath good leave.

1430
01:58:17,240 --> 01:58:19,669
Fair Katherine,
and most fair,

1431
01:58:19,769 --> 01:58:21,813
will you vouchsafe
to teach a soldier...

1432
01:58:21,913 --> 01:58:24,213
terms such as will enter
at a lady's ear...

1433
01:58:24,313 --> 01:58:28,140
and plead his love suit
to her gentle heart?

1434
01:58:28,695 --> 01:58:31,732
Your majesty
shall mock at me.

1435
01:58:31,832 --> 01:58:34,933
I cannot speak your England.

1436
01:58:35,033 --> 01:58:36,341
Oh.

1437
01:58:39,224 --> 01:58:42,580
Fair Katherine, if you will love me
soundly with your French heart,

1438
01:58:42,680 --> 01:58:46,165
glad to hear you confess it
brokenly with your English

1439
01:58:46,265 --> 01:58:48,629
Do you like me, Kate?

1440
01:58:48,729 --> 01:58:53,003
Pardonnez-moi. I cannot
tell what is "like me."

1441
01:58:53,625 --> 01:58:56,471
An angel is like you, Kate,
and you are like an angel.

1442
01:58:56,856 --> 01:58:58,805
Que dit-il? Que je suis
semblable a les anges?

1443
01:58:58,905 --> 01:59:02,101
Qui, vraiment, sauf votre
grace, ainsi dit-il.

1444
01:59:02,201 --> 01:59:03,727
Mon dieu.

1445
01:59:04,664 --> 01:59:07,765
Les langues des hommes
sont pleines de tromperies.

1446
01:59:07,865 --> 01:59:09,206
What says she, fair one?

1447
01:59:09,306 --> 01:59:13,622
That the tongues of men
are full of deceits?

1448
01:59:13,722 --> 01:59:18,422
Oui. That the tongues of
the mens is be full of deceits.

1449
01:59:18,522 --> 01:59:20,942
That is the princess.

1450
01:59:22,425 --> 01:59:25,238
I'faith, my wooing is fit
for thy understanding.

1451
01:59:25,338 --> 01:59:29,431
I know no ways to mince it in love,
but directly to say, "I love you."

1452
01:59:29,531 --> 01:59:33,048
Then, if you urge me farther than to say,
"Do you in faith?" I wear out my suit.

1453
01:59:33,148 --> 01:59:37,455
Give me your answer... i'faith do... and so
clap hands and a bargain. How say you, lady?

1454
01:59:38,234 --> 01:59:41,048
Sauf votre honneur,
me understand well.

1455
01:59:41,466 --> 01:59:45,368
Marry, if you would put me to verses or
to dance for your sake, why, you undid me.

1456
01:59:45,468 --> 01:59:47,935
If I could win a lady at leapfrog
or by vaulting into my saddle...

1457
01:59:48,035 --> 01:59:50,256
with my arm around my back,
I should quickly leap into a wife.

1458
01:59:50,356 --> 01:59:53,495
I could lay on like a butcher and
sit like a jackanapes, never off.

1459
01:59:53,595 --> 01:59:56,567
But before God, Kate,
I cannot look greenly...

1460
01:59:56,667 --> 02:00:01,815
Nor gasp out my eloquence nor
I have no cunning in protestation.

1461
02:00:03,098 --> 02:00:04,973
If thou canst love a fellow
of this temper, Kate,

1462
02:00:05,073 --> 02:00:07,533
that never looks in his glass
for love of anything he sees there,

1463
02:00:07,633 --> 02:00:09,967
let thine eye be thy cook.

1464
02:00:10,171 --> 02:00:14,072
I speak to thee plain soldier. If thou
canst love me for this, take me.

1465
02:00:14,172 --> 02:00:16,824
If not, to say to thee
that I shall die, 'tis true,

1466
02:00:16,924 --> 02:00:18,904
but for thy love,
by the lord, no.

1467
02:00:19,004 --> 02:00:20,694
Yet I love thee too.

1468
02:00:21,339 --> 02:00:24,824
If thou would have
such a one, take me.

1469
02:00:24,924 --> 02:00:28,337
And take me, take a soldier.

1470
02:00:28,572 --> 02:00:32,182
Take a soldier, take a king.

1471
02:00:33,340 --> 02:00:35,769
And what sayest thou
then to my love?

1472
02:00:35,869 --> 02:00:37,078
Speak, my fair,

1473
02:00:37,308 --> 02:00:40,885
and fairly, too, I pray thee.

1474
02:00:41,372 --> 02:00:45,626
Is it possible that I should
love the enemy of France?

1475
02:00:46,173 --> 02:00:47,580
No, kate.

1476
02:00:48,349 --> 02:00:51,991
It is not possible that you
should love the enemy of France.

1477
02:00:52,733 --> 02:00:56,026
But in loving me, you should
love the friend of France,

1478
02:00:56,126 --> 02:00:59,450
for I love France so well that
I will not part with a village of it.

1479
02:00:59,550 --> 02:01:01,210
I will have it all mine.

1480
02:01:01,310 --> 02:01:03,642
And, Kate, when France
is mine, and I am yours,

1481
02:01:03,742 --> 02:01:06,839
then yours is France,
and you are mine.

1482
02:01:08,765 --> 02:01:11,131
I cannot tell what is that.

1483
02:01:11,357 --> 02:01:12,437
No, kate?

1484
02:01:14,333 --> 02:01:18,170
I will tell thee in French...

1485
02:01:18,270 --> 02:01:20,029
which I am sure will
hang about my tongue...

1486
02:01:20,157 --> 02:01:24,345
like a new-married wife about her
husband's neck, hardly to be shook off.

1487
02:01:25,918 --> 02:01:29,659
Je quand sur
le possession de France...

1488
02:01:29,759 --> 02:01:35,035
et, uh, quand vous
avez la possession,

1489
02:01:35,135 --> 02:01:36,628
uh, de moi...

1490
02:01:37,598 --> 02:01:38,875
Let me see...

1491
02:01:38,975 --> 02:01:41,564
Uh, oh...

1492
02:01:41,664 --> 02:01:45,180
Donc, uh, votre est france...

1493
02:01:45,280 --> 02:01:49,533
et, uh, vous etes mienne.

1494
02:01:50,271 --> 02:01:52,257
It is as easy for me, Kate,
to conquer the kingdom...

1495
02:01:52,357 --> 02:01:54,012
as to speak so much more French!

1496
02:01:54,112 --> 02:01:57,306
I will never move thee in French
unless it be to laugh at me.

1497
02:01:59,390 --> 02:02:03,037
Sauf votre honneur,
le francais que vous parlez...

1498
02:02:03,137 --> 02:02:06,550
Il est meilleur
que I'anglais lequel je parle.

1499
02:02:07,360 --> 02:02:09,596
No, faith, it is not.

1500
02:02:09,696 --> 02:02:10,808
But tell me, Kate,

1501
02:02:11,776 --> 02:02:15,385
Canst thou understand
thus much English?

1502
02:02:16,192 --> 02:02:19,704
Canst thou love me?

1503
02:02:23,135 --> 02:02:24,248
I cannot tell.

1504
02:02:24,544 --> 02:02:27,325
Well, can any of your neighbors
tell, Kate? I'll ask them.

1505
02:02:27,872 --> 02:02:30,173
By mine honor, in true English,
I swear I love thee,

1506
02:02:30,273 --> 02:02:32,413
by which honor I dare
not swear thou lovest me.

1507
02:02:32,513 --> 02:02:37,084
Yet my blood begins to flatter
me that thou dost...

1508
02:02:37,184 --> 02:02:40,798
withstanding the poor and
untempering effect of my vis

1509
02:02:40,898 --> 02:02:43,101
Now beshrew
my father's ambition!

1510
02:02:43,201 --> 02:02:45,086
He was thinking of
civil wars when he got me.

1511
02:02:45,186 --> 02:02:47,678
Therefore was I created
with a stubborn outside,

1512
02:02:47,778 --> 02:02:50,974
with an aspect of iron, that
when I come to woo ladies,

1513
02:02:51,074 --> 02:02:52,382
I fright them.

1514
02:02:53,953 --> 02:02:57,150
But, in faith, kate, the elder I wax,
the better I shall appear.

1515
02:02:57,250 --> 02:03:01,375
My comfort is that old age,
that ill layer-up of beauty,

1516
02:03:01,475 --> 02:03:04,767
can do no more spoil
upon my face.

1517
02:03:04,867 --> 02:03:09,054
Thou hast me... if thou
hast me... at the worst.

1518
02:03:09,314 --> 02:03:12,383
And thou shalt wear me...
if thou wear me...

1519
02:03:12,483 --> 02:03:14,107
Better and better.

1520
02:03:14,658 --> 02:03:17,853
And, therefore, tell me,
most fair Katherine,

1521
02:03:18,274 --> 02:03:20,030
Will you have me?

1522
02:03:21,475 --> 02:03:23,327
Come, your answer
in broken music,

1523
02:03:23,427 --> 02:03:25,920
for thy voice is music,

1524
02:03:26,020 --> 02:03:29,214
and thy English, broken.

1525
02:03:29,538 --> 02:03:32,480
Therefore, queen of all,
Katherine,

1526
02:03:32,580 --> 02:03:34,465
wilt thou have me?

1527
02:03:37,218 --> 02:03:40,185
That is as it shall please
le roi mon pere.

1528
02:03:41,666 --> 02:03:44,639
Nay, it shall
please him well, Kate.

1529
02:03:44,739 --> 02:03:47,519
It shall please him, Kate.

1530
02:03:48,963 --> 02:03:52,191
Then it shall also content me.

1531
02:03:55,044 --> 02:04:00,577
Upon that, I kiss your hand,
and I call you my queen.

1532
02:04:00,677 --> 02:04:02,880
Laissez, mon seigneur,
laissez, laissez.

1533
02:04:02,980 --> 02:04:05,664
Ma foi, je ne veux point que
vous abaissiez votre grandeur...

1534
02:04:05,764 --> 02:04:09,472
En baisant la main d'une de
votre seigneurie indigne serviteur.

1535
02:04:09,636 --> 02:04:13,826
Excusez-moi, je vous supplie,
mon tres-puissant seigneur.

1536
02:04:13,926 --> 02:04:15,713
Then I will kiss
your lips, Kate.

1537
02:04:15,813 --> 02:04:18,882
Les dames et demoiselles pour
etre baisees devant leur noces...

1538
02:04:18,982 --> 02:04:21,058
Il n'est pas
la coutume de France.

1539
02:04:21,158 --> 02:04:22,786
Madame my interpreter,
what says she?

1540
02:04:22,886 --> 02:04:25,506
That is not be the fashion
for the ladies of France...

1541
02:04:25,606 --> 02:04:29,250
Oh, I cannot tell
what Isbaiserin English.

1542
02:04:29,350 --> 02:04:30,756
To kiss?

1543
02:04:31,301 --> 02:04:33,922
Your majestyentends
betterque moi.

1544
02:04:34,022 --> 02:04:38,810
Ah, it is not a fashion for the maids in
France to kiss before they are married?

1545
02:04:39,046 --> 02:04:40,769
Oui, vraiment.

1546
02:04:41,126 --> 02:04:42,271
Oh, kate.

1547
02:04:43,205 --> 02:04:45,474
Nice customs curtsy
to great kings.

1548
02:04:45,574 --> 02:04:49,793
You and I cannot be confined within
the weak list of a country's fashion.

1549
02:04:50,149 --> 02:04:54,687
We... are the makers
of manners, Kate.

1550
02:04:55,333 --> 02:04:57,379
Therefore, patiently...

1551
02:04:57,479 --> 02:04:58,786
and yielding.

1552
02:05:09,190 --> 02:05:13,051
You have witchcraft
in your lips, Kate.

1553
02:05:13,798 --> 02:05:16,579
There is more eloquence
in a sugar touch of them...

1554
02:05:16,679 --> 02:05:20,132
than in the tongues
of the French council.

1555
02:05:20,232 --> 02:05:22,434
Here comes your father.

1556
02:05:26,983 --> 02:05:29,600
God save
your majesty.

1557
02:05:29,927 --> 02:05:31,171
My royal cousin,

1558
02:05:31,431 --> 02:05:34,430
teach you
our princess english?

1559
02:05:35,367 --> 02:05:37,892
I would have her learn,
my fair cousin,

1560
02:05:37,992 --> 02:05:42,114
how perfectly I love her,

1561
02:05:42,312 --> 02:05:44,935
and that is good english.

1562
02:06:03,784 --> 02:06:08,191
We have consented
to all terms of reason.

1563
02:06:24,713 --> 02:06:28,639
And thereupon
give me your daughter.

1564
02:06:31,305 --> 02:06:32,614
Take her, fair son,

1565
02:06:34,852 --> 02:06:38,887
and from her blood
raise up issue to me...

1566
02:06:38,987 --> 02:06:43,111
that the contending kingdoms
of France and England...

1567
02:06:43,211 --> 02:06:47,271
whose very shores look pale with
envy of each other's happiness...

1568
02:06:47,371 --> 02:06:50,533
may cease their hatred...

1569
02:06:50,731 --> 02:06:53,763
and this
dear conjunction...

1570
02:06:54,122 --> 02:06:56,360
plant neighborhood...

1571
02:06:56,460 --> 02:06:59,912
and Christian-like accord
in their sweet bosoms...

1572
02:07:00,012 --> 02:07:03,337
that never war advance...

1573
02:07:03,691 --> 02:07:05,128
his bleeding sword...

1574
02:07:05,228 --> 02:07:09,448
'twixt England
and fair France.

1575
02:07:10,477 --> 02:07:11,761
Amen.

1576
02:07:13,612 --> 02:07:17,866
Now, welcome, Kate,
and bear me witness all...

1577
02:07:18,188 --> 02:07:22,310
That here I kiss her
as my sovereign queen.

1578
02:07:29,031 --> 02:07:32,273
God, the best maker
of all marriages,

1579
02:07:32,390 --> 02:07:35,854
combine our hearts in one,
our realms in one.

1580
02:07:36,098 --> 02:07:39,662
As man and wife, being two,
are one in love,

1581
02:07:39,762 --> 02:07:43,375
so be there 'twixt our kingdoms
such a spousal...

1582
02:07:43,475 --> 02:07:46,815
that never may ill office
or fell jealousy...

1583
02:07:47,165 --> 02:07:49,969
which troubles oft
the bed of blessed marriage...

1584
02:07:50,202 --> 02:07:53,007
thrust in between
the paction of these kingdoms...

1585
02:07:53,239 --> 02:07:56,174
to make divorce
of their incorporate league...

1586
02:07:56,274 --> 02:07:58,255
that English may as French,

1587
02:07:58,355 --> 02:08:01,840
French Englishmen,
receive each other.

1588
02:08:01,940 --> 02:08:04,043
God speak this.

1589
02:08:04,722 --> 02:08:06,762
Amen.
Amen.

1590
02:08:09,825 --> 02:08:14,328
Thus far, with rough
and all-unable pen...

1591
02:08:14,428 --> 02:08:17,971
our bending author
hath pursued the story...

1592
02:08:18,140 --> 02:08:21,369
in little room
confining mighty men...

1593
02:08:21,469 --> 02:08:25,776
mangling by starts
the full course of their glory.

1594
02:08:26,299 --> 02:08:27,641
Small time,

1595
02:08:28,124 --> 02:08:32,089
but in that small
most greatly lived...

1596
02:08:32,189 --> 02:08:35,089
this star of England.

1597
02:08:35,346 --> 02:08:37,530
Fortune made his sword...

1598
02:08:37,630 --> 02:08:40,889
by which the world's
best garden he achieved...

1599
02:08:40,989 --> 02:08:44,442
and of it left
his son imperial lord.

1600
02:08:44,542 --> 02:08:49,370
Henry the sixth, in infant bands
crowned king of France and England

1601
02:08:49,470 --> 02:08:51,291
did this king succeed...

1602
02:08:51,391 --> 02:08:56,219
whose state so many
had the managing...

1603
02:08:56,319 --> 02:08:59,698
that they lost France...

1604
02:08:59,805 --> 02:09:03,285
and made his England bleed...

1605
02:09:04,080 --> 02:09:07,351
which oft our stage
hath shown,

1606
02:09:07,582 --> 02:09:09,511
and, for their sake,

1607
02:09:10,212 --> 02:09:15,731
in your fair minds
let this acceptance take.
