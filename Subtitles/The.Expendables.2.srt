1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:01,400
What do you want from me, Church?

2
00:00:01,401 --> 00:00:03,831
I knew that day would come
when you're gonna pay me back.

3
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:07,609
You can't let the contents of that
safe fall into the wrong hands.

4
00:00:09,901 --> 00:00:11,411
Track 'em, find 'em, kill 'em.

5
00:00:11,412 --> 00:00:14,062
You're gonna need more men if you
expect to get out of here alive.

6
00:00:14,566 --> 00:00:15,430
You're terminated.

7
00:00:16,144 --> 00:00:16,954
In your dreams.

8
00:00:17,898 --> 00:00:18,698
Here we go!

9
00:00:46,548 --> 00:00:48,248
My shoe is bigger than this car!

10
00:00:48,249 --> 00:00:49,147
Shoot something!

11
00:00:50,052 --> 00:00:51,882
You're not doing what I think you're doing?

12
00:00:51,883 --> 00:00:52,683
Yeah, I am.

13
00:00:55,006 --> 00:00:56,144
THE EXPANDABLES 2

14
00:00:56,232 --> 00:00:58,132
We're gonna need a new plane.

15
00:00:58,157 --> 00:01:00,157
