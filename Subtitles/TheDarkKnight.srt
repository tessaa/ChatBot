They must never know what he did.

2028
02:15:40,113 --> 02:15:41,865
Five dead.

2029
02:15:42,153 --> 02:15:43,381
Two of them cops.

2030
02:15:43,553 --> 02:15:45,908
–You can't sweep that…
–No.

2031
02:15:50,513 --> 02:15:53,232
But the Joker cannot win.

2032
02:15:58,273 --> 02:16:01,345
Gotham needs its true hero.

2033
02:16:07,473 --> 02:16:10,385
–No.
–You either die a hero…

2034
02:16:10,553 --> 02:16:14,831
or you live long enough
to see yourself become the villain.

2035
02:16:14,993 --> 02:16:16,745
I can do those things…

2036
02:16:17,153 --> 02:16:20,065
because I'm not a hero, not like Dent.

2037
02:16:22,953 --> 02:16:25,857
I killed those people.
That's what I can be.

2038
02:16:25,873 --> 02:16:27,853
No, no, you can't. You're not.

2039
02:16:27,873 --> 02:16:30,341
I'm whatever Gotham needs me to be.

2040
02:16:31,953 --> 02:16:33,022
Call it in.

2041

GORDON:
A hero.

2042
02:16:38,033 --> 02:16:41,267
Not the hero we deserved,
but the hero we needed.

2043
02:16:41,713 --> 02:16:44,147
Nothing less than a knight…

2044
02:16:44,673 --> 02:16:46,311
shining.

2045
02:16:46,913 --> 02:16:48,593
GORDON:
<i>They'll hunt you.</i>

2046

BATMAN:
<i>You'll hunt me.</i>

2047
02:16:50,833 --> 02:16:52,710
<i>You'll condemn me.</i>

2048
02:16:53,393 --> 02:16:55,588
<i>Set the dogs on me.</i>

2049
02:16:59,193 --> 02:17:02,031
<i>Because that's what needs to happen.</i>

2050
02:17:02,513 --> 02:17:04,344
<i>Because sometimes…</i>

2051
02:17:04,513 --> 02:17:06,955
<i>… the truth isn't good enough.</i>

2052
02:17:07,433 --> 02:17:09,875
<i>Sometimes people deserve more.</i>

2053
02:17:12,953 --> 02:17:16,833
<i>Sometimes people deserve
to have their faith rewarded.</i>

JAMES:
Batman.

2056
02:17:37,793 --> 02:17:39,465
Batman!

2057
02:17:40,233 --> 02:17:42,110
Why's he running, Dad?

2058
02:17:43,113 --> 02:17:44,513
Because we have to chase him.

2059
02:17:44,553 --> 02:17:47,306
Okay, we're going in! Go, go! Move!

2060
02:17:53,153 --> 02:17:54,793
He didn't do anything wrong.

[BARKING]

2062
02:17:57,313 --> 02:18:02,671
Because he's the hero Gotham deserves,
but not the one it needs right now.

2063
02:18:04,033 --> 02:18:05,683
<i>So we'll hunt him…</i>

2064
02:18:08,033 --> 02:18:10,145
<i>… because he can take it.</i>

2065
02:18:12,433 --> 02:18:14,822
<i>Because he's not our hero.</i>

2066
02:18:22,073 --> 02:18:24,053
<i>He's a silent guardian…</i>

2067
02:18:24,353 --> 02:18:26,150
a watchful protector.

2068
02:18:28,553 --> 02:18:29,939
<i>A dark knight.</i>
