1
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,349
Have you ever felt like
you were a little bit different?

2
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:55,386
Like you had something unique
to offer the world...

3
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:58,683
...if you could just get people
to see it.

4
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:04,159
Then you know exactly how it felt...

5
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,389
... to be me.

6
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:07,760
Go ahead, Flint.

7
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:14,303
What is the number one problem
facing our community today?

8
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:16,298
Untied shoelaces.

9
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:21,880
Which is why I've invented
a laceless alternative foot covering.

10
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:24,312
Spray-On Shoes.

11
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:30,122
- Voila.
-They're so nifty.

12
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:33,016
How you gonna get them off, nerd?

13
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:40,898
What a freak.
He wants to be smart, but that's lame.

14
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:49,467
I wanted to run away that day.

15
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:53,506
But you can't run away
from your own feet.

16
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,220
Not every sardine is meant
to swim, son.

17
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,753
I don't understand
fishing metaphors.

18
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,193
-What did I say?
-Don't worry.

19
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:18,163
Honey, I think your shoes
are wonderful.

20
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:20,636
Everyone just thinks I'm a weirdo.

21
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,172
So?

22
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:25,311
People probably thought
that these guys were weirdoes too.

23
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:28,544
But that never stopped them.

24
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:33,152
I was saving this
for your birthday, but here.

25
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:36,117
A professional-grade lab coat.

26
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:38,189
Just like the real guys wear.

27
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,893
It fits perfect.

28
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:45,030
The world needs
your originality, Flint.

29
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:48,891
You just have to grow into it.

30
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:52,697
And I know that you're gonna do
big things someday.

31
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:17,786
From that moment on...

32
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:21,263
...I was determined
to invent something great.

33
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:24,267
Remote Control Television.

34
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:28,130
And, the pitch is in.

35
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:30,266
Eventually.

36
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:32,604
Hair Un- Balder.

37
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,475
Flying Car.

38
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:40,047
Monkey Thought Translator.

39
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,949
-Hungry. Hungry. Hungry.
- How wise.

40
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:46,558
No, Steve. No, no, no, no, no!
No, please! Leave it--

41
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:48,616
Ratbirds.

42
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:50,888
Hey, what's going on, little guy?

43
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,055
Flint Lockwood.

44
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:56,829
My dream was to help
my hometown...

45
00:03:57,003 --> 00:04:00,632
...a tiny island hidden under
the "A " in "Atlantic"...

46
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,736
...called Swallow Falls.

47
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:06,574
We were famous for sardines...

48
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:11,076
... until the day the Baby Brent
Sardine Cannery closed for good.

49
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,846
Right after everyone in the world
realized that sardines...

50
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:16,215
...are super gross.

51
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:23,687
Soon, all of us were stuck eating
the sardines that no one else wanted.

52
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:30,200
Poached, fried, boiled, dried,
candied and juiced.

53
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,735
Life became gray and flavorless.

54
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:38,104
But when all seemed lost,
I stared at defeat...

55
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,343
...and found hope.

56
00:05:22,587 --> 00:05:25,055
My name is Flint Lockwood.

57
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:28,491
And I was about to invent
a machine...

58
00:05:28,659 --> 00:05:30,490
... that turns water...

59
00:05:30,661 --> 00:05:32,822
...into food.

60
00:05:33,731 --> 00:05:37,724
Steve, my best friend
and trusted colleague.

61
00:05:38,135 --> 00:05:39,159
Steve.

62
00:05:39,337 --> 00:05:42,067
Can I count on your help?

63
00:05:44,475 --> 00:05:45,499
Can.

64
00:05:46,844 --> 00:05:48,436
I knew I could.

65
00:05:48,613 --> 00:05:51,173
Button, on.
Memory, activate.

66
00:05:51,349 --> 00:05:55,217
Blueprints, awesome.
Begin nano-mutation.

67
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,981
Radiation matrix, secure.

68
00:05:58,556 --> 00:06:00,148
Computer, boot.

69
00:06:01,826 --> 00:06:03,987
Coolness enhancement, complete.

70
00:06:04,161 --> 00:06:05,992
Engage coffee break.

71
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,361
Networking power grid.

72
00:06:19,377 --> 00:06:22,369
Beginning conversion of water...

73
00:06:22,546 --> 00:06:24,207
...into food.

74
00:06:24,382 --> 00:06:26,441
Hydrating protein matrix.

75
00:06:26,917 --> 00:06:29,545
Calibrating flavor panel.

76
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,553
Priming chow plopper.

77
00:06:33,157 --> 00:06:36,217
Uploading cool machine voice.

78
00:06:37,595 --> 00:06:39,153
Cheeseburger.

79
00:06:40,097 --> 00:06:44,090
Everyone is going to love this.

80
00:07:09,894 --> 00:07:11,122
Flint!

81
00:07:11,295 --> 00:07:12,762
Sorry, Dad.

82
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,198
Steve, keep working.

83
00:07:18,602 --> 00:07:20,934
Scanning hand.

84
00:07:38,422 --> 00:07:41,016
That's a really weird dude.

85
00:07:45,496 --> 00:07:48,158
Re-energizing tower unit.

86
00:07:53,304 --> 00:07:55,363
Jeez. See you, Dad.

87
00:07:57,074 --> 00:07:58,598
Flint.

88
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,876
Don't you think it's time to give up
this inventing thing, get a real job?

89
00:08:08,052 --> 00:08:09,542
No, why?

90
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,157
Well, all your technology stuff,
it just ends in disaster.

91
00:08:14,325 --> 00:08:17,192
The ratbirds, yes, they escaped
and bred at a surprising rate.

92
00:08:17,361 --> 00:08:20,023
But I took care of that problem
and disposed of them.

93
00:08:20,197 --> 00:08:22,028
Billy, just play dead.

94
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:26,431
Flint, you don't keep throwing your net
where there aren't any fish.

95
00:08:26,604 --> 00:08:28,367
- What?
-I want you to work full-time...

96
00:08:28,539 --> 00:08:31,235
-...at the tackle shop.
-The tackle shop? Dad, no.

97
00:08:31,408 --> 00:08:33,000
Tackle is a good career.

98
00:08:33,177 --> 00:08:34,804
Please, I'm so close with this one.

99
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:39,109
I just have to hook it up to the power
station and give it power and it'll work.

100
00:08:39,283 --> 00:08:41,308
And then you could sell food
in the shop...

101
00:08:41,485 --> 00:08:44,249
...and then everyone won't have to eat
sardines anymore.

102
00:08:44,421 --> 00:08:48,016
It is going to be so awesome.

103
00:08:48,726 --> 00:08:50,785
I'm sorry, son.

104
00:08:50,961 --> 00:08:52,087
No more inventing.

105
00:08:52,263 --> 00:08:55,391
Dad, I know I can do this.

106
00:08:55,566 --> 00:08:56,760
And Mom did too.

107
00:08:58,969 --> 00:09:02,564
It had been almost 10 years
since Mom died...

108
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:06,073
...and Dad still didn't understand me
like she did.

109
00:09:06,243 --> 00:09:09,701
Come on. Let's open the shop.

110
00:09:12,483 --> 00:09:15,350
Tim and Son
Sardine Bait and Tackle.

111
00:09:16,821 --> 00:09:18,618
You feeling it?

112
00:09:22,059 --> 00:09:24,960
Look out, Baby Brent!

113
00:09:26,897 --> 00:09:28,421
Baby Brent Sardines.

114
00:09:28,599 --> 00:09:31,227
Hand-packed in Swallow Falls.

115
00:09:31,402 --> 00:09:36,203
As your mayor, I know it's time to put
our sardine-canning past behind us...

116
00:09:36,373 --> 00:09:38,671
...and look to the future.

117
00:09:38,843 --> 00:09:40,902
Sardine tourism!

118
00:09:42,313 --> 00:09:44,338
That's why,
without consulting anyone...

119
00:09:44,515 --> 00:09:48,144
...I spent the entire town budget
on the thing that is under this tarp...

120
00:09:48,319 --> 00:09:50,787
... which I will be unveiling today...

121
00:09:50,955 --> 00:09:52,786
...at noon.

122
00:09:52,957 --> 00:09:57,587
Featuring a live appearance
by Baby Brent himself.

123
00:09:57,761 --> 00:10:01,060
What is up, everybody?

124
00:10:01,232 --> 00:10:03,166
-Hey.
-Hey, it's Baby Brent.

125
00:10:03,334 --> 00:10:07,395
What you doing? Stacking cans
with me on them as a baby?

126
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:12,272
Anyways, who wants to watch me
cut the ribbon...

127
00:10:12,443 --> 00:10:14,035
...at the mayor's unveiling thing?

128
00:10:14,211 --> 00:10:17,942
I'll be using these bad boys
to help save the town.

129
00:10:20,517 --> 00:10:23,350
All right, you guys.
Sardines, yeah.

130
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,354
- Swallow Falls forever!
-What a delight.

131
00:10:27,524 --> 00:10:31,358
Listen, you-- Maybe you wanna go
to that unveiling?

132
00:10:31,528 --> 00:10:35,487
You know, Dad, why don't you
go ahead. I'll hold down the fort here.

133
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:38,567
Really? You sure you can handle it?

134
00:10:38,736 --> 00:10:41,068
Yeah, Dad,
I'm pretty sure I'll be fine.

135
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:42,799
All right, then.

136
00:10:42,973 --> 00:10:45,908
I'll be back in half an hour, skipper.

137
00:10:46,076 --> 00:10:48,271
Okay. Bye.

138
00:10:56,086 --> 00:10:58,987
This hellhole is too small
for me, Brent.

139
00:10:59,156 --> 00:11:01,056
I wanna be big.

140
00:11:01,225 --> 00:11:05,685
I want people to look at me and say,
"That is one big mayor."

141
00:11:05,863 --> 00:11:07,728
And that's why this has to work.

142
00:11:07,898 --> 00:11:09,559
It has to work.

143
00:11:09,733 --> 00:11:12,896
Otherwise, I'm just a tiny mayor
of a tiny town...

144
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:16,437
...full of tiny sardine-sucking
knuckle-scrapers.

145
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,074
But not me, right?

146
00:11:18,242 --> 00:11:22,736
Oh, not you, Brent. No.
You've always been like a son to me.

147
00:11:25,349 --> 00:11:27,579
Hey, everybody.

148
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:34,551
Under this tarp is the greatest tourist
attraction ever built by humans.

149
00:11:34,725 --> 00:11:37,319
We just need 1 7 000 more gigajoules.

150
00:11:37,494 --> 00:11:40,395
- An attraction so....
-Go, go, go.

151
00:11:41,832 --> 00:11:43,595
What are you doing, Flint Lockwood?

152
00:11:43,767 --> 00:11:46,292
Just holding my hands
behind my back respectfully, sir.

153
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:48,404
-You know what you are, Lockwood?
- No.

154
00:11:48,572 --> 00:11:50,403
A shenaniganizer.

155
00:11:50,574 --> 00:11:51,939
A tomfool.

156
00:11:52,109 --> 00:11:54,373
-You see my beautiful angel son Cal?
-What's up?

157
00:11:54,545 --> 00:11:57,036
I love him so much.
This is my only son.

158
00:11:57,214 --> 00:11:58,841
I want him to have a bright future.

159
00:11:59,016 --> 00:12:01,280
A future in which you don't ruin
our town's day...

160
00:12:01,452 --> 00:12:03,682
...with one of your
crazy science thingies.

161
00:12:03,854 --> 00:12:07,017
- Well, that's all behind me- - 
- You see this contact lens, Lockwood?

162
00:12:07,191 --> 00:12:09,250
-This contact lens represent you.
-All right.

163
00:12:09,426 --> 00:12:11,656
-And my eye represents my eye.
-Okay.

164
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:16,562
I got my eye on you.

165
00:12:16,734 --> 00:12:19,999
-Oh, my gosh, a jaywalker.
-Hey.

166
00:12:20,671 --> 00:12:24,607
And I've arranged for live coverage
from a major network...

167
00:12:24,775 --> 00:12:28,336
...and their most experienced
professional reporter.

168
00:12:29,713 --> 00:12:32,546
Oh, just send the intern.
She's cute, and she's super perky.

169
00:12:32,716 --> 00:12:36,948
Well, those are the only things we look
for in a TV weatherperson. Intern.

170
00:12:37,121 --> 00:12:40,318
How would you like to do a weather
report from a rinky-dink island...

171
00:12:40,491 --> 00:12:42,982
...in the middle of the ocean
as a favor to my cousin?

172
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,218
Really?

173
00:12:44,862 --> 00:12:46,261
Can you believe it, Manny?

174
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:49,991
Temporary
professional meteorologist.

175
00:12:50,167 --> 00:12:51,725
Okay, Manny, what about this?

176
00:12:51,902 --> 00:12:53,733
Welcome, America,
I'm Sam Sparks.

177
00:12:53,904 --> 00:12:56,270
Hello, America, Sam Sparks here.

178
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,499
America, hi. I didn't see you there.

179
00:12:58,675 --> 00:13:00,040
It's me, Sam Sparks.

180
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:04,579
On my way across the ocean.

181
00:13:05,082 --> 00:13:09,712
Now, when she gets here,
I wanna see a lot of smiling faces.

182
00:13:09,887 --> 00:13:11,548
Act like, "Hey, whoa."

183
00:13:12,256 --> 00:13:15,555
This is a great idea.

184
00:13:16,226 --> 00:13:17,750
Weather News Network.

185
00:13:17,928 --> 00:13:19,555
Weather news happens...

186
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:21,061
...or not.

187
00:13:21,231 --> 00:13:22,823
Now we're over to Swallow Falls...

188
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,332
...where our intern
is on her first day on the job.

189
00:13:25,502 --> 00:13:28,164
Or should I say, first gray on the job.

190
00:13:28,338 --> 00:13:29,930
Looks pretty cloudy there, intern.

191
00:13:30,107 --> 00:13:32,041
Hello, Sam Sparks, I'm America.

192
00:13:32,576 --> 00:13:37,479
It's Swallow Falls degrees and--
Well, let's just go to the mayor.

193
00:13:37,648 --> 00:13:41,948
Thank you and welcome,
national television audience.

194
00:13:42,119 --> 00:13:46,715
You are about to witness
an historic event, undoubtedly....

195
00:13:50,127 --> 00:13:53,460
And now, here to cut
the ceremonial ribbon...

196
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:58,829
...Swallow Falls' favorite son,
Baby Brent!

197
00:13:59,002 --> 00:14:00,367
He's still got it, folks.

198
00:14:00,537 --> 00:14:01,663
Yeah.

199
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,336
I'm the best person
in the whole town.

200
00:14:12,683 --> 00:14:15,618
Food synthesis, go.

201
00:14:17,721 --> 00:14:21,623
My chest hairs are tingling.
Something's wrong.

202
00:14:22,392 --> 00:14:27,659
Well, here it is. The attraction
the whole world has been waiting for:.

203
00:14:27,831 --> 00:14:29,958
Sardine Land.

204
00:14:32,202 --> 00:14:34,329
With rides and exhibits.

205
00:14:34,505 --> 00:14:38,566
And featuring Shamo,
the world's largest sardine...

206
00:14:38,742 --> 00:14:41,973
...and his flaming hoop of glory.

207
00:14:42,846 --> 00:14:45,838
Those of you in the splash zone,
look out.

208
00:14:46,016 --> 00:14:47,142
Yeah.

209
00:14:54,191 --> 00:14:56,022
Cheeseburger.

210
00:14:56,193 --> 00:14:57,251
Flint Lockwood.

211
00:14:57,427 --> 00:15:00,658
Just a second.
I'm in the middle of a- -

212
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:15,371
Well, looks like things in Swallow Falls
are sardine to get better. For--

213
00:15:15,546 --> 00:15:17,309
What just happened to me?

214
00:15:17,481 --> 00:15:18,641
Sorry.

215
00:15:40,204 --> 00:15:42,035
No.

216
00:15:42,973 --> 00:15:44,668
You're under arrest, Flint Lockwood.

217
00:15:44,841 --> 00:15:49,278
Thank goodness you only caused
minimal damage to Sardine Land.

218
00:15:55,185 --> 00:15:56,209
Come on.

219
00:16:05,762 --> 00:16:08,253
I really shouldn't be running
with these.

220
00:16:11,702 --> 00:16:14,364
Jump, jump, jump, run, run,
jump, jump, run.

221
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:38,653
-It's a good thing no one got hurt!
- Flint Lockwood!

222
00:16:38,829 --> 00:16:43,027
I didn't get hurt, but that does
not mean that I'm not still mad at you.

223
00:17:48,298 --> 00:17:50,528
Oh, my gosh. I am so sorry.
Are you okay?

224
00:17:50,701 --> 00:17:53,693
-I didn't get a chance to--
-It's okay, it's just pain.

225
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:55,462
Sorry, I'm not myself today.

226
00:17:55,639 --> 00:18:00,576
My whole career was ruined by some
crazy jerk riding a homemade rocket.

227
00:18:01,678 --> 00:18:03,339
Wait a minute.

228
00:18:03,513 --> 00:18:05,981
What is going on with your feet?

229
00:18:06,149 --> 00:18:08,879
Spray-On Shoes.
They don't come off.

230
00:18:09,052 --> 00:18:10,417
Cool.

231
00:18:11,288 --> 00:18:13,313
This could solve
the untied shoes epidemic.

232
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:16,550
What are they made of, some kind of
elastic biopolymer adhesive?

233
00:18:16,727 --> 00:18:18,160
Yeah.

234
00:18:18,328 --> 00:18:19,352
Exactly.

235
00:18:19,529 --> 00:18:21,258
I mean....

236
00:18:21,698 --> 00:18:25,065
Wow, they're shiny. I'm Sam.

237
00:18:26,002 --> 00:18:27,230
- Flint.
- Steve.

238
00:18:27,838 --> 00:18:30,398
-ls that a Monkey Thought Translator?
- Steve.

239
00:18:31,775 --> 00:18:36,109
Incredible.
Did you make all of this stuff?

240
00:18:36,513 --> 00:18:39,243
- You hit me with a rocket.
- You kicked me in the face.

241
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:41,509
I said I was sorry.

242
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:45,686
Do you know how hard it is
to break into the weather game?

243
00:18:45,856 --> 00:18:49,553
I spent my entire life building up
to that moment.

244
00:18:50,327 --> 00:18:52,454
You get one shot at the show.

245
00:18:52,629 --> 00:18:54,722
And if you don't make it...

246
00:18:54,898 --> 00:18:58,390
...it's back to cleaning
the barometers.

247
00:19:05,475 --> 00:19:07,136
Cheese?

248
00:19:11,581 --> 00:19:15,312
But that could only mean....

249
00:20:02,432 --> 00:20:05,333
Excited. Excited.

250
00:20:15,745 --> 00:20:17,110
My machine works.

251
00:20:18,982 --> 00:20:23,146
It really works!

252
00:20:26,189 --> 00:20:27,679
Your machine?

253
00:20:27,858 --> 00:20:29,553
Is that what that rocket was?

254
00:20:31,061 --> 00:20:32,688
Do you like it?

255
00:20:33,096 --> 00:20:34,120
I love it!

256
00:20:34,598 --> 00:20:37,032
This is just amazing.
Look at this.

257
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,998
This is the greatest weather
phenomenon in history.

258
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:42,138
Hey, aren't you a weathergirl?

259
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:47,009
Manny, get your camera.

260
00:21:02,592 --> 00:21:07,029
This just in; Our humiliated weather
intern is apparently back for more.

261
00:21:07,197 --> 00:21:10,496
Thanks, Patrick. Okay, everybody,
you are not gonna believe this one...

262
00:21:10,667 --> 00:21:15,104
...but I am standing
in the middle of a burger rain.

263
00:21:15,272 --> 00:21:16,899
You may have seen
a meteor shower...

264
00:21:17,073 --> 00:21:20,873
...but you've never seen a shower
meatier than this.

265
00:21:21,044 --> 00:21:25,174
For a town stuck eating sardines,
this is totally manna from heaven.

266
00:21:25,348 --> 00:21:28,340
This tastes significantly better
than sardines.

267
00:21:35,358 --> 00:21:38,020
This is going to be big.

268
00:21:38,194 --> 00:21:40,287
This food weather
was created intentionally...

269
00:21:40,463 --> 00:21:43,660
...by meek-ish backyard tinkerer
Flint Lockwood.

270
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:45,824
Flint Lockwood?

271
00:21:46,002 --> 00:21:47,026
Hi.

272
00:21:47,203 --> 00:21:49,262
You're under arrest
for ruining Sardine Land.

273
00:21:49,439 --> 00:21:51,031
Flint, those burgers were awesome.

274
00:21:51,207 --> 00:21:54,574
The producer called and he was like,
"Everybody loves that food weather."

275
00:21:54,744 --> 00:21:55,938
- Food weather.
- What?

276
00:21:56,112 --> 00:21:57,909
This could be bigger
than Sardine Land.

277
00:21:58,081 --> 00:21:59,844
-Can you make it rain food again?
- No.

278
00:22:00,016 --> 00:22:02,211
- I don't know if l- - 
-You're gonna do it again?

279
00:22:02,385 --> 00:22:03,716
You gotta be kidding.

280
00:22:03,887 --> 00:22:06,082
Please, please, please.

281
00:22:08,992 --> 00:22:10,789
- Yes.
- No.

282
00:22:10,961 --> 00:22:13,657
- Give me one more chance.
- We know this was an accident.

283
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,957
- I know.
-Cheeseburgers from the sky...

284
00:22:16,132 --> 00:22:17,724
...that's not natural.

285
00:22:17,901 --> 00:22:20,563
My invention could save
the whole town.

286
00:22:20,737 --> 00:22:23,331
You will be so proud of me, Dad.

287
00:22:23,506 --> 00:22:25,303
Plus...

288
00:22:25,475 --> 00:22:26,840
...there's a girl here.

289
00:22:29,145 --> 00:22:33,104
Can you look me in the eye and
tell me you've got this under control...

290
00:22:33,283 --> 00:22:35,308
...and it's not gonna end up
in a disaster?

291
00:22:36,186 --> 00:22:37,448
Yes.

292
00:22:52,035 --> 00:22:55,129
I've got this under control,
and it's not gonna end in disaster.

293
00:22:57,407 --> 00:22:59,466
-All right.
- Thanks, Dad.

294
00:22:59,643 --> 00:23:02,874
- Oh, sure.
-Okay. So, Sam...

295
00:23:03,046 --> 00:23:07,142
...this is where the magic happens.

296
00:23:08,451 --> 00:23:11,818
Lick. Lick. Lick.

297
00:23:11,988 --> 00:23:15,219
Lick. Lick. Lick.

298
00:23:16,693 --> 00:23:18,126
Welcome, Flint.

299
00:23:20,497 --> 00:23:23,057
You seriously spend
a lot of time alone.

300
00:23:23,233 --> 00:23:24,666
What?

301
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,567
So here's how it works.

302
00:23:28,738 --> 00:23:32,731
Water goes in the top,
and food comes out the bottom.

303
00:23:32,909 --> 00:23:34,774
When you shot it
into the stratosphere...

304
00:23:34,944 --> 00:23:38,675
...you figured it would induce a phase
change from the cumulonimbus layer?

305
00:23:38,848 --> 00:23:41,840
That's actually
a really smart observation.

306
00:23:42,018 --> 00:23:43,713
I mean....

307
00:23:44,521 --> 00:23:46,955
The clouds probably have water
in them...

308
00:23:47,123 --> 00:23:50,524
...which, I guess, is why
you shot it up there in the first place.

309
00:23:50,694 --> 00:23:52,821
Right, right. That's why I did that.

310
00:23:52,996 --> 00:23:54,987
-On purpose.
-Right. Yeah.

311
00:23:55,165 --> 00:23:56,894
-Right.
- Of course.

312
00:23:58,435 --> 00:23:59,993
Okay.

313
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:03,264
The machine uses a principle
of hydro-genetic mutation.

314
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,432
Water molecules are bombarded
with microwave radiation...

315
00:24:06,609 --> 00:24:10,067
...which mutates their genetic recipe
into any kind of food you want.

316
00:24:10,246 --> 00:24:11,406
So....

317
00:24:11,581 --> 00:24:12,605
- Pizza?
- Yes.

318
00:24:12,782 --> 00:24:13,908
-Mashed potatoes?
- Yes.

319
00:24:14,084 --> 00:24:15,551
- Peas?
- Yes, that's also a food.

320
00:24:15,719 --> 00:24:16,947
-Steak? Apples?
- Yes.

321
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,553
-Apple sauce? BLT?
- Yes.

322
00:24:18,722 --> 00:24:20,883
-I said any kind of food.
-Chicken wings?

323
00:24:21,057 --> 00:24:23,719
Think about what you're saying,
and if it's a food, yes.

324
00:24:23,893 --> 00:24:26,191
-Baloney.
-Baloney. That is a food.

325
00:24:26,362 --> 00:24:28,626
- How about Jell- O?
-Do you like Jell-O?

326
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:30,265
I love Jell- O.

327
00:24:30,433 --> 00:24:32,833
I love Jell- O too.
Oh, and peanut butter, right?

328
00:24:33,002 --> 00:24:35,402
Oh, no, no, no,
I am severely allergic to peanuts.

329
00:24:35,572 --> 00:24:36,596
Hey, me too.

330
00:24:36,773 --> 00:24:38,365
- What's it called?
-Peanut allergy.

331
00:24:38,541 --> 00:24:39,599
- No, the machine.
- Of course.

332
00:24:40,176 --> 00:24:42,974
It's called the Flint Lockwood
Diatonic Super-Mutating...

333
00:24:43,146 --> 00:24:45,273
...Dynamic Food Replicator.

334
00:24:45,448 --> 00:24:47,109
Or, for short:

335
00:24:47,283 --> 00:24:49,046
The FLDSMDFR.

336
00:24:49,552 --> 00:24:50,644
Fliminadifiser?

337
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,151
FLDSMDFR.

338
00:24:52,322 --> 00:24:53,721
Fliminubahdibferer?

339
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:55,517
Fli.

340
00:24:55,692 --> 00:24:57,455
Suh.

341
00:24:57,727 --> 00:24:58,989
Fdiferf.

342
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:03,231
Manny, make sure you get this.
He's gonna make the food now.

343
00:25:03,399 --> 00:25:04,423
Now?

344
00:25:04,601 --> 00:25:08,332
Well, the thing is, I can't...

345
00:25:08,505 --> 00:25:11,565
...wait to show you
this hilarious Internet video.

346
00:25:12,675 --> 00:25:13,699
What?

347
00:25:13,877 --> 00:25:15,105
Fight the power!

348
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:17,246
What is this?

349
00:25:21,718 --> 00:25:23,015
It's so cute.

350
00:25:23,186 --> 00:25:25,017
Pushing. Folding. Connecting.

351
00:25:25,188 --> 00:25:27,986
Taping. Turning.
Painting. Switching.

352
00:25:28,158 --> 00:25:29,284
Staring.

353
00:25:29,459 --> 00:25:30,824
Motivating.

354
00:25:30,994 --> 00:25:33,519
-Placing button.
-I can't believe I've been watching this...

355
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:35,755
-...for three hours.
- I know.

356
00:25:45,008 --> 00:25:46,202
It's working.

357
00:25:46,376 --> 00:25:48,367
What do you guys want for breakfast?

358
00:25:48,545 --> 00:25:50,536
- Gummi Bears.
- Whoa, Steve, no.

359
00:25:50,713 --> 00:25:52,874
We both know how you get
around Gummi Bears.

360
00:25:53,049 --> 00:25:54,448
How about...

361
00:25:54,617 --> 00:25:56,175
-...eggs.
- And toast.

362
00:25:56,352 --> 00:25:57,649
Orange juice.

363
00:25:57,821 --> 00:25:59,516
- And bacon.
- Bacon.

364
00:26:00,523 --> 00:26:01,854
What are you doing?

365
00:26:02,025 --> 00:26:03,458
Nothing.

366
00:26:03,626 --> 00:26:04,650
To the computer.

367
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:12,033
So you're sure this is safe?

368
00:26:12,569 --> 00:26:15,060
Don't worry. I have a Dangeometer
that lets us know...

369
00:26:15,238 --> 00:26:17,001
...if the food is going
to over- mutate.

370
00:26:17,173 --> 00:26:19,073
What happens
if the food over- mutates?

371
00:26:19,242 --> 00:26:21,642
I don't know.
But that'll never happen.

372
00:26:21,811 --> 00:26:24,177
All right, this probably
won't explode.

373
00:26:24,347 --> 00:26:25,371
What?

374
00:26:32,088 --> 00:26:33,749
Bacon.

375
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:42,423
Those cheeseburgers
were only the beginning...

376
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:45,363
...because a breakfast system
is on its way to Swallow Falls.

377
00:26:45,535 --> 00:26:46,729
My forecast?

378
00:26:46,903 --> 00:26:48,837
Sunny side up.

379
00:26:56,212 --> 00:26:58,680
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

380
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:10,591
Flint, my boy. Can you do lunch?

381
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,091
All right, here's the skinny:

382
00:27:12,262 --> 00:27:15,129
You keep making it rain
the snackadoos...

383
00:27:15,298 --> 00:27:17,266
...weathergirl provides
free advertising...

384
00:27:17,433 --> 00:27:19,628
...I have taken out
a very high-interest loan...

385
00:27:19,802 --> 00:27:22,862
...to convert this Podunk town
into a tourist food-topia.

386
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:26,440
All you have to do is make it rain food
three meals a day...

387
00:27:26,609 --> 00:27:28,577
...every day
for the foreseeable future...

388
00:27:28,745 --> 00:27:31,509
...and in 30 days we hold a grand
reopening of the island...

389
00:27:31,681 --> 00:27:34,479
...as a must- see cruise destination.

390
00:27:34,651 --> 00:27:37,279
And everyone, everywhere...

391
00:27:37,453 --> 00:27:41,787
...is going to love your invention.

392
00:27:42,158 --> 00:27:43,455
Do you think so?

393
00:27:43,626 --> 00:27:46,060
I know so.

394
00:27:50,433 --> 00:27:53,425
Now that's what I call
poultry in motion.

395
00:28:03,346 --> 00:28:05,906
Mr. Lockwood,
may I please have waffles?

396
00:28:06,082 --> 00:28:07,413
- Falafels?
-Jellybeans.

397
00:28:07,583 --> 00:28:08,948
- Avocado.
-Coming right up.

398
00:28:11,821 --> 00:28:13,015
Leftovers?

399
00:28:13,189 --> 00:28:16,556
Not a problem with Flint Lockwood's
latest invention, the Outtasighter...

400
00:28:16,726 --> 00:28:19,627
...so-named because it catapults
uneaten food out of sight...

401
00:28:19,796 --> 00:28:22,287
...and therefore, out of mind.

402
00:28:30,974 --> 00:28:32,669
Jellybeans!

403
00:28:32,842 --> 00:28:33,866
Awesome.

404
00:28:34,043 --> 00:28:36,341
- BLT.
-Doughnuts.

405
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,545
Pie.

406
00:28:38,715 --> 00:28:39,739
Gummi bears.

407
00:28:39,949 --> 00:28:42,213
- Fish.
- Creme brulee!

408
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,554
A pizza stuffed inside a turkey...

409
00:28:46,723 --> 00:28:49,521
...the whole thing deep-fried
and dipped in chocolate.

410
00:28:50,226 --> 00:28:52,091
It's me, the mayor.

411
00:28:52,695 --> 00:28:54,060
You look different.

412
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:55,993
Did you get a new haircut?

413
00:28:56,165 --> 00:28:58,190
Yes, I did. Thank you for noticing.

414
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:07,276
-I love you.
-Thanks, Dad. I love you.

415
00:29:07,276 --> 00:29:08,800
-I love you.
-Thanks, Dad. I love you.

416
00:29:08,978 --> 00:29:10,741
I love spending time with you, Dad.

417
00:29:15,018 --> 00:29:17,646
Hey, Dad, I'm headed back
to the lab.

418
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:21,654
If you wanna come,
I could show you how I make the food.

419
00:29:22,158 --> 00:29:23,648
No, thanks.

420
00:29:23,826 --> 00:29:28,957
That techno-food, it's too complicated
for an old fisherman.

421
00:29:29,132 --> 00:29:30,997
Got it.

422
00:29:31,934 --> 00:29:35,335
Could still use your help around here,
though, you know.

423
00:29:35,505 --> 00:29:38,167
I'm working
with the mayor now, Dad.

424
00:29:38,341 --> 00:29:41,504
I mean, the town's grand reopening
is in, like, a week.

425
00:29:41,677 --> 00:29:43,941
Right. Got it.

426
00:29:50,653 --> 00:29:52,985
Flint Lockwood?

427
00:29:53,623 --> 00:29:55,250
Yeah?

428
00:29:56,726 --> 00:29:58,990
It's my son Cal's birthday
tomorrow...

429
00:29:59,162 --> 00:30:02,563
...and I was just wondering if you
could make it rain something special.

430
00:30:02,732 --> 00:30:05,132
Well, I'm pretty backed up
on requests.

431
00:30:05,301 --> 00:30:06,962
Plus, you're always mean to me.

432
00:30:07,136 --> 00:30:08,967
It'll be just one time...

433
00:30:09,138 --> 00:30:11,606
...for my special angel's special day.

434
00:30:12,875 --> 00:30:14,240
I don't know.

435
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:17,709
You know, I don't wanna
overwork the machine, so....

436
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:21,372
Okay. I knew it was a long shot.

437
00:30:21,551 --> 00:30:24,281
I just wanted Cal to see how much
his father loves him.

438
00:30:24,454 --> 00:30:26,217
I thought you would understand.

439
00:30:29,192 --> 00:30:31,387
You know how fathers always trying
to express...

440
00:30:31,561 --> 00:30:35,224
...their love and appreciation
for their sons.

441
00:30:39,068 --> 00:30:40,126
Earl, wait.

442
00:30:51,614 --> 00:30:53,775
Touch. Touch. Touch.

443
00:30:55,918 --> 00:30:57,146
I've got an idea.

444
00:31:15,238 --> 00:31:17,138
Happy birthday, son.

445
00:31:17,306 --> 00:31:18,466
Dad?

446
00:31:18,641 --> 00:31:20,973
This is your day. Go have fun.

447
00:31:21,144 --> 00:31:24,705
-I love you guys. You're awesome.
-I love you too, son.

448
00:31:24,881 --> 00:31:28,476
-Have a good time, baby.
- lce cream!

449
00:31:29,352 --> 00:31:32,446
Yeah! Cool.

450
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:36,785
Strawberry's my favorite.

451
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:50,062
Come on, Dad.

452
00:31:50,239 --> 00:31:51,729
I don't know, Cal.

453
00:31:51,908 --> 00:31:54,274
This doesn't look safe!

454
00:32:02,185 --> 00:32:03,311
I love you, son.

455
00:32:03,486 --> 00:32:06,649
I know, Dad. You tell me every day.

456
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,523
Flint, this is amazing.

457
00:32:12,695 --> 00:32:15,289
And designing the ice cream
to accumulate into scoops...

458
00:32:15,464 --> 00:32:17,364
...I don't know how
you're gonna top this.

459
00:32:17,533 --> 00:32:20,400
Maybe with hot fudge.

460
00:32:22,572 --> 00:32:23,664
Hey, Flint.

461
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:25,864
You wanna be in a snowball fight
with us?

462
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:29,002
Flint, what's the problem?

463
00:32:29,178 --> 00:32:31,373
I've never actually been
in a snowball fight.

464
00:32:31,547 --> 00:32:33,777
-Really?
- I don't even know the rules.

465
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:37,579
Is there like a point system or is it...

466
00:32:37,753 --> 00:32:39,618
-...to the death?
- No- -

467
00:32:39,789 --> 00:32:44,817
You've nev- -? I mean, look, even
Steve is throwing chocolate snowballs.

468
00:32:49,532 --> 00:32:52,968
So like this?

469
00:32:53,502 --> 00:32:55,697
No, harder than that.

470
00:32:58,107 --> 00:33:00,701
Snowball.
Snowball, snowball, snowball.

471
00:33:01,711 --> 00:33:04,202
Snowball. Snowball.

472
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:07,372
Well, something to be said
for enthusiasm.

473
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:09,542
Snowball!

474
00:33:10,052 --> 00:33:11,644
Snowball!

475
00:33:14,857 --> 00:33:16,757
Snowball and snowball.

476
00:33:16,926 --> 00:33:17,984
Kids? What's going on?

477
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,253
Snowball.

478
00:33:21,497 --> 00:33:23,328
- Snowball.
- Snowball. Snowball.

479
00:33:23,499 --> 00:33:24,830
I scream, you scream...

480
00:33:25,001 --> 00:33:29,301
...we all scream for Flint Lockwood's
latest tasty town-wide treat...

481
00:33:29,472 --> 00:33:32,532
...with flurries of frozen fun
on what the mayor declared to be...

482
00:33:32,708 --> 00:33:34,141
...an ice cream snow day.

483
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:37,837
He'd also like to invite everyone
in the world to catch a cruise liner...

484
00:33:38,014 --> 00:33:39,641
...and come on down
this Saturday...

485
00:33:39,815 --> 00:33:42,306
...for the grand opening
of Chew And Swallow...

486
00:33:42,485 --> 00:33:45,648
...a town that is truly a la mode.

487
00:33:53,362 --> 00:33:56,422
A town that is truly
topped with ice cream.

488
00:33:56,599 --> 00:33:59,534
With today's scoop
for the Weather News Network...

489
00:33:59,702 --> 00:34:02,068
...I'm Sam Sparks.

490
00:34:02,238 --> 00:34:05,969
Flint, this is the best breakfast ever.

491
00:34:12,515 --> 00:34:13,539
That's it!

492
00:34:13,716 --> 00:34:15,445
Researching. Role-playing.

493
00:34:15,618 --> 00:34:17,017
Dialing.

494
00:34:17,186 --> 00:34:18,813
Waiting.

495
00:34:21,057 --> 00:34:22,957
-Sam Sparks.
-Hanging up.

496
00:34:23,125 --> 00:34:25,355
Regretting. Re-psyching.

497
00:34:25,528 --> 00:34:27,393
Saying what I'm doing.

498
00:34:27,563 --> 00:34:29,588
- Flint?
-"Hi, Sam, how are you? That's nice.

499
00:34:29,765 --> 00:34:32,029
I was wondering if you would like
to go on a da--"

500
00:34:32,201 --> 00:34:33,532
Activity with me tomorrow.

501
00:34:35,604 --> 00:34:38,038
-Okay.
-Great, bye. Meet me in the forest.

502
00:34:38,207 --> 00:34:40,641
Nailed it. Gotta go, Steve.

503
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:43,870
Keep an eye on the lab for me.

504
00:34:45,414 --> 00:34:47,780
Steve.

505
00:34:48,217 --> 00:34:49,912
Foster still at the plate.

506
00:34:50,086 --> 00:34:52,020
And nobody out.

507
00:34:52,188 --> 00:34:53,655
Where are we going?

508
00:34:53,823 --> 00:34:56,053
Oh, nowhere.
I just thought it'd be nice...

509
00:34:56,225 --> 00:35:00,286
...for the two of us
to go on a walk together.

510
00:35:00,463 --> 00:35:03,489
Like you do as friends.

511
00:35:03,933 --> 00:35:06,993
Oh, my, what's that?

512
00:35:16,078 --> 00:35:17,739
Jell-O's my favorite.

513
00:35:18,414 --> 00:35:20,712
You never made a request, so...

514
00:35:20,883 --> 00:35:22,714
...I made one for you.

515
00:35:25,554 --> 00:35:27,385
Flint?

516
00:35:27,556 --> 00:35:28,921
Flint?

517
00:35:29,325 --> 00:35:30,952
Join me.

518
00:35:44,673 --> 00:35:45,799
But how did you--?

519
00:35:45,975 --> 00:35:49,172
I made it rain Jell-O, then I gathered
it up with the Outtasighter...

520
00:35:49,345 --> 00:35:51,472
...and then I brought it here
and pressed it...

521
00:35:51,647 --> 00:35:55,208
...into a gigantic custom-carved plastic
Tupperware mold I made. No big deal.

522
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,417
Everything's made of Jell-O.

523
00:35:59,588 --> 00:36:01,078
This piano, those sconces...

524
00:36:01,257 --> 00:36:03,725
...that ghetto blaster, that Jell-O,
that aquarium...

525
00:36:03,893 --> 00:36:05,986
...that Venus de Milo
with your face on it...

526
00:36:06,162 --> 00:36:09,097
...next to a Michelangelo's David
that also has your face.

527
00:36:09,899 --> 00:36:13,096
Come on, Sam,
what are you waiting for?

528
00:36:15,271 --> 00:36:16,568
Nothing!

529
00:36:19,308 --> 00:36:20,332
Yeah.

530
00:36:33,355 --> 00:36:35,084
Cannonball.

531
00:36:36,492 --> 00:36:37,959
Belly flop.

532
00:36:41,597 --> 00:36:43,588
Why did I do that?

533
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:54,074
- So Jell- O.
-Right. Right, right.

534
00:36:54,243 --> 00:36:55,710
It's a solid, it's a liquid...

535
00:36:55,878 --> 00:37:00,372
...it's a visco-elastic polymer made of
polypeptide chains, but you eat it.

536
00:37:00,549 --> 00:37:02,210
I mean...

537
00:37:02,384 --> 00:37:04,443
...it tastes good.

538
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,554
-Why do you do that?
- Do what?

539
00:37:06,722 --> 00:37:10,852
Say something super smart
and then bail from it.

540
00:37:12,595 --> 00:37:13,653
Can you keep a secret?

541
00:37:13,829 --> 00:37:15,592
No.

542
00:37:16,565 --> 00:37:19,056
But this time, sure, yeah.

543
00:37:20,202 --> 00:37:26,163
Okay. Well, it was a really
long time ago, but l, too, was...

544
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:29,068
...a nerd.

545
00:37:29,678 --> 00:37:30,702
Too?

546
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,246
When I was a little girl...

547
00:37:33,415 --> 00:37:36,009
...I wore a ponytail, I had glasses...

548
00:37:36,185 --> 00:37:39,882
...and I was totally obsessed
with the science of weather.

549
00:37:42,291 --> 00:37:44,282
Other girls wanted a Barbie.

550
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:48,328
I wanted a Doppler Weather
Radar 2000 Turbo.

551
00:37:48,497 --> 00:37:51,466
But all the kids used to taunt me
with this lame song.

552
00:37:51,634 --> 00:37:52,658
It wasn't even clever.

553
00:37:52,835 --> 00:37:54,769
Four-eyes, four-eyes

554
00:37:54,937 --> 00:37:56,996
You need glasses to see

555
00:37:59,909 --> 00:38:01,399
Go on.

556
00:38:02,244 --> 00:38:03,609
So I got a new look...

557
00:38:03,779 --> 00:38:06,270
...gave up the science-y
smart stuff...

558
00:38:06,448 --> 00:38:08,575
...and I was never
made fun of again.

559
00:38:08,751 --> 00:38:12,778
And I still need these glasses,
but I never wear them.

560
00:38:12,955 --> 00:38:15,446
-I'll bet you look great with glasses on.
- I'm not- -

561
00:38:15,624 --> 00:38:17,114
And on they go.

562
00:38:21,096 --> 00:38:22,120
- What?
-Nothing.

563
00:38:22,298 --> 00:38:23,788
Wait.

564
00:38:27,836 --> 00:38:30,134
It's a Jell- O scrunchie.

565
00:38:33,175 --> 00:38:36,008
And now, the reveal.

566
00:38:39,515 --> 00:38:40,539
Wow.

567
00:38:41,784 --> 00:38:44,412
I mean, you were okay before...

568
00:38:44,587 --> 00:38:46,487
...but now...

569
00:38:46,956 --> 00:38:49,117
...you're beautiful.

570
00:38:49,291 --> 00:38:51,987
No, I'm not. I can't go out in public
like this.

571
00:38:52,161 --> 00:38:54,994
Well, why not?

572
00:38:55,164 --> 00:38:58,224
I mean, this is the real you, right?

573
00:38:59,702 --> 00:39:01,260
Smart.

574
00:39:01,437 --> 00:39:03,405
Bespectacled.

575
00:39:04,006 --> 00:39:05,974
Who wouldn't wanna see that?

576
00:39:06,141 --> 00:39:10,737
You know, I've never met anyone
like you, Flint Lockwood.

577
00:39:10,913 --> 00:39:12,676
Me either.

578
00:39:12,848 --> 00:39:14,975
But about you.

579
00:39:31,967 --> 00:39:33,696
Flint, you have a call

580
00:39:33,869 --> 00:39:35,769
Flint, you have a call

581
00:39:35,938 --> 00:39:37,701
Is your phone ringing?

582
00:39:37,873 --> 00:39:40,899
That's weird.
Someone must've changed my ring.

583
00:39:41,076 --> 00:39:43,203
Oh, it's the mayor.
Do you mind if I take this?

584
00:39:43,379 --> 00:39:44,403
No, no, no.

585
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:47,344
- Go ahead, take it. That's fine.
-I'm sorry. It's important.

586
00:39:47,516 --> 00:39:50,917
-I should be going too. It's getting late.
-I'm just gonna step outside.

587
00:40:01,296 --> 00:40:03,423
Dad, you came.
I have so much to tell you.

588
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:06,625
-Do I look all right?
-You look great. Come on, let's go.

589
00:40:08,003 --> 00:40:09,300
Dad, I almost kissed a girl.

590
00:40:09,471 --> 00:40:12,167
-It's Baby Brent, you know?
-lt was the coolest thing-- Hi.

591
00:40:13,008 --> 00:40:15,841
- I should be on the list.
-Hey, Brian.

592
00:40:16,011 --> 00:40:21,142
What? You're letting that guy in?
That guy's a nerd.

593
00:40:23,218 --> 00:40:25,049
Hey, how's it going?

594
00:40:25,688 --> 00:40:28,122
Oh, thank you. Thank you so much.
Thank you.

595
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:31,589
A toast.
To Flint and his delicious steaks.

596
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,695
-Oh, thanks. Thank you.
-Very nice place.

597
00:40:34,863 --> 00:40:36,763
Oh, wow. Thank you.

598
00:40:36,932 --> 00:40:39,833
- Flint Lockwood.
- Earl.

599
00:40:45,274 --> 00:40:46,605
So no roof.

600
00:40:46,775 --> 00:40:49,073
Yep. You just hold out your plate.

601
00:40:49,244 --> 00:40:51,235
And I even made it rain
your favorite:

602
00:40:51,413 --> 00:40:52,437
Meat.

603
00:40:59,855 --> 00:41:00,879
Okay.

604
00:41:01,557 --> 00:41:05,015
So you know how the grand reopening
of the town is tomorrow?

605
00:41:05,194 --> 00:41:10,427
Well, the mayor has asked me
to cut the ribbon.

606
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:12,965
He said my invention
saved the town.

607
00:41:13,402 --> 00:41:15,734
Aren't you proud of me?

608
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:25,339
Well...

609
00:41:26,115 --> 00:41:28,413
...doesn't this steak look
a little big to you?

610
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:35,752
Yeah, it's a big steak. I mean, every
steak is not exactly the same size.

611
00:41:35,924 --> 00:41:38,415
Did you even hear what I just said?

612
00:41:39,795 --> 00:41:41,626
Son, look around.

613
00:41:41,797 --> 00:41:44,322
I'm not sure this is good for people.

614
00:41:45,901 --> 00:41:48,301
Maybe you should think about
turning this thing off.

615
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:51,234
It's making everybody happy.

616
00:41:51,473 --> 00:41:53,338
Everybody except you.

617
00:41:54,009 --> 00:41:56,273
When are you gonna accept
that this is who I am...

618
00:41:56,445 --> 00:42:00,541
...instead of trying to get me to work
in some boring tackle shop?

619
00:42:02,151 --> 00:42:03,743
Well...

620
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:06,787
...you seem like you know
what you're doing, then.

621
00:42:08,757 --> 00:42:11,351
I guess I'll just get out of your way.

622
00:42:39,421 --> 00:42:40,649
Get with the times, man.

623
00:42:40,823 --> 00:42:43,485
I mean, there's no pleasing
that guy.

624
00:42:43,659 --> 00:42:47,755
He just wants to take anything good
I do and just smoosh it.

625
00:42:57,539 --> 00:42:59,973
These are big hot dogs.

626
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:11,843
Man.

627
00:43:12,454 --> 00:43:14,888
I mean, this isn't that bad.

628
00:43:15,057 --> 00:43:16,854
- Is it, Steve?
- Yellow.

629
00:43:17,025 --> 00:43:18,151
You're right, Steve.

630
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:21,126
The Dangeometer is in the yellow.

631
00:43:21,296 --> 00:43:22,661
I don't know what to do.

632
00:43:22,831 --> 00:43:24,423
I do...

633
00:43:25,167 --> 00:43:27,727
...declare these hot dogs
to be delicious!

634
00:43:28,837 --> 00:43:30,498
Oh, no.

635
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,771
How did you get in here?

636
00:43:32,941 --> 00:43:34,772
Tomorrow's the big day, Flint.

637
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:38,711
The entire town's fate is resting
on your food weather.

638
00:43:38,881 --> 00:43:40,007
I'm thinking pasta.

639
00:43:40,449 --> 00:43:44,909
Some light apps.
I know you won't let us down.

640
00:43:47,022 --> 00:43:49,923
Well, Mr. Mayor, I think there's
something you should see.

641
00:43:50,092 --> 00:43:51,354
What?

642
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,696
This is the molecular structure
of a hot dog that fell last week.

643
00:43:56,265 --> 00:44:00,725
And this is the molecular structure
of a hot dog that fell today.

644
00:44:01,136 --> 00:44:02,899
The machine uses
microwave radiation...

645
00:44:03,071 --> 00:44:05,301
...to mutate the genetic recipe
of the food.

646
00:44:05,474 --> 00:44:08,136
The more we ask it to make,
the more clouds it takes in...

647
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:12,303
...the more radiation it emits, the more
these molecules could over- mutate.

648
00:44:13,315 --> 00:44:15,715
I think that's why the food
is getting bigger.

649
00:44:16,752 --> 00:44:18,549
Here's what I heard:

650
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,915
"Science, science, science, bigger."

651
00:44:21,089 --> 00:44:22,750
And bigger is better.

652
00:44:22,925 --> 00:44:26,520
Everyone's gonna love
these new portion sizes.

653
00:44:27,562 --> 00:44:28,927
I know I do.

654
00:44:31,767 --> 00:44:33,598
My dad thinks I should turn it off.

655
00:44:33,769 --> 00:44:38,001
Geniuses like us are never understood
by their fathers, Flint.

656
00:44:38,173 --> 00:44:39,265
But what if things go--

657
00:44:39,441 --> 00:44:41,671
Who needs the approval
of one family member...

658
00:44:41,843 --> 00:44:44,710
...when you can have it
from millions of acquaintances?

659
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,407
Not to mention that little cutlet,
Sam Sparks.

660
00:44:48,583 --> 00:44:50,141
And me.

661
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:54,380
I've always felt that you were
like a son to me, Flint.

662
00:44:54,556 --> 00:44:59,516
And I'm gonna be so proud of you
tomorrow when you cut that ribbon...

663
00:44:59,695 --> 00:45:01,185
...save the town...

664
00:45:01,363 --> 00:45:05,959
...and prove to everybody
what a great inventor you are.

665
00:45:06,134 --> 00:45:08,659
So here's the cheese:

666
00:45:08,837 --> 00:45:10,805
You can keep it going...

667
00:45:10,973 --> 00:45:12,941
...get everything
you've ever wanted...

668
00:45:13,108 --> 00:45:16,407
...and be the great man
I know you can be.

669
00:45:16,578 --> 00:45:19,342
Or you can turn it off...

670
00:45:19,514 --> 00:45:21,277
...ruin everything...

671
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:25,113
...and no one will ever like you.

672
00:45:25,787 --> 00:45:27,618
It's your choice.

673
00:45:27,789 --> 00:45:29,086
Choice.

674
00:45:29,257 --> 00:45:30,690
Choice.

675
00:45:30,859 --> 00:45:31,883
Choice.

676
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:33,357
Choice.

677
00:45:33,528 --> 00:45:35,428
Choice.

678
00:45:38,166 --> 00:45:39,190
Okay.

679
00:45:50,379 --> 00:45:53,075
I mean, bigger is better...

680
00:45:53,248 --> 00:45:54,272
...right?

681
00:45:54,449 --> 00:45:56,542
Oh, yeah.

682
00:46:00,455 --> 00:46:04,255
Spaghetti. Asparagus. Celery.
Garlic bread. Meatball. Shrimp.

683
00:46:17,672 --> 00:46:19,970
- Looks safe to me.
-And sanitary too.

684
00:46:53,708 --> 00:46:56,871
Who's hungry?

685
00:46:57,045 --> 00:47:01,607
Welcome, tourists,
to Chew And Swallow.

686
00:47:01,783 --> 00:47:03,307
That is one big mayor.

687
00:47:03,485 --> 00:47:06,943
Delight in our nacho-cheese
hot springs.

688
00:47:08,156 --> 00:47:11,182
Allow your kids to eat
all the junk food they want...

689
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:14,089
...in our completely
unsupervised Kid Zone!

690
00:47:14,262 --> 00:47:16,287
I've got jellybeans for teeth.

691
00:47:16,465 --> 00:47:18,330
And when the fun is done...

692
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:22,436
...gaze upon the sunset
cresting over Mount Leftovers.

693
00:47:22,604 --> 00:47:26,404
From which we're protected
by a presumably indestructible dam.

694
00:47:26,842 --> 00:47:30,642
We've got people here today
from all around the world...

695
00:47:30,812 --> 00:47:33,042
...from as far as China
to West Virginia.

696
00:47:33,215 --> 00:47:35,080
Also I think there's
some Canadians here.

697
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:37,514
- You need to look at this.
-Why aren't you on TV?

698
00:47:37,686 --> 00:47:39,551
You're supposed
to be broadcasting this.

699
00:47:39,721 --> 00:47:42,053
There's a problem.
The food's getting bigger.

700
00:47:42,224 --> 00:47:45,193
I know, it's great. Bigger portion sizes.
Everyone loves it.

701
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,692
I'm not sure we're doing
the right thing here.

702
00:47:47,863 --> 00:47:50,263
What if we've bitten off more
than we can chew?

703
00:47:50,432 --> 00:47:54,368
For the first time in my life, everybody
loves something that I've done.

704
00:47:54,536 --> 00:47:56,731
Why can't you just be
happy for me...

705
00:47:56,905 --> 00:47:59,430
...and go say the weather
or something. Jeez.

706
00:47:59,608 --> 00:48:00,973
And without further ado...

707
00:48:01,143 --> 00:48:05,079
...our town's hero
and my metaphorical son...

708
00:48:05,247 --> 00:48:07,647
...Flint Lockwood.

709
00:48:07,816 --> 00:48:09,147
Yeah, Flint.

710
00:48:09,317 --> 00:48:11,342
Thank you. Thank you, everyone.

711
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,147
-Sign my shrimp.
-Thank you.

712
00:48:13,321 --> 00:48:15,221
- Yeah. Yeah.
-I love you.

713
00:48:15,724 --> 00:48:17,885
I admire your quirkiness, dude.

714
00:48:18,059 --> 00:48:21,688
Brent, we're gonna need you
to hand over the ceremonial scissors.

715
00:48:22,297 --> 00:48:23,764
But- -

716
00:48:23,999 --> 00:48:25,023
No.

717
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,328
- You can't. You can't take them. No.
-Here you go.

718
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:31,402
I'm Baby Brent.

719
00:48:33,475 --> 00:48:36,273
Put your clothes back on.

720
00:48:36,878 --> 00:48:39,244
Who am l?

721
00:48:41,016 --> 00:48:43,143
Go ahead, Flint.

722
00:48:43,318 --> 00:48:45,718
Everybody loves you.

723
00:48:45,887 --> 00:48:48,583
Lockwood! Lockwood! Lockwood!

724
00:48:48,757 --> 00:48:51,692
Lockwood! Lockwood! Lockwood!

725
00:49:24,793 --> 00:49:27,853
Danger. Danger. Danger.

726
00:49:31,533 --> 00:49:34,229
Salt-and-pepper wind?

727
00:49:36,004 --> 00:49:37,562
Oregano.

728
00:49:54,155 --> 00:49:57,215
Sam, wait. No, I can turn it off.

729
00:50:02,564 --> 00:50:04,156
I can turn it off.

730
00:50:17,245 --> 00:50:19,770
All right, kid, it's all gonna be okay.

731
00:50:22,484 --> 00:50:24,475
Oh, no.

732
00:50:26,821 --> 00:50:29,449
- Pardon me.
- Pardon me.

733
00:50:30,191 --> 00:50:32,716
- Excuse me.
-No problem.

734
00:50:36,398 --> 00:50:38,025
No.

735
00:50:45,473 --> 00:50:47,805
- Gummi Bears.
- Not now, Steve.

736
00:50:54,282 --> 00:50:57,251
Condiments? Salt? Pepper?

737
00:50:59,654 --> 00:51:01,349
Flint.

738
00:51:05,393 --> 00:51:07,725
This is Sam Sparks,
live from Chew And Swallow...

739
00:51:07,896 --> 00:51:09,363
...where a spaghetti twister--

740
00:51:09,531 --> 00:51:13,729
Sam, hey, we love a good storm
over here, but you look like a nerd.

741
00:51:13,902 --> 00:51:18,134
Patrick, several children are stranded
in the path of this tomato tornado.

742
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:19,964
My tummy hurts.

743
00:51:21,843 --> 00:51:23,140
Cal.

744
00:51:24,412 --> 00:51:27,472
What is that, a scrunchie? I haven't
seen one of those since 1995.

745
00:51:27,649 --> 00:51:31,278
What? We have
an actual weather emergency.

746
00:51:31,453 --> 00:51:33,421
Well, we'll get right back
to that storm...

747
00:51:33,588 --> 00:51:36,352
...and hopefully Sam'll look
a little more appealing.

748
00:51:44,032 --> 00:51:47,593
Steve, we just have to upload the kill
code and then we'll shut down the- -

749
00:51:47,769 --> 00:51:48,997
What are you doing here?

750
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:51,434
I've been ordering dinner
for the last 1 0 minutes.

751
00:51:51,606 --> 00:51:54,040
-ls something going on?
-I've gotta stop the machine.

752
00:51:54,209 --> 00:51:56,404
Everyone's in danger
because of me.

753
00:51:56,578 --> 00:51:59,445
Oh, it can't be that bad.

754
00:51:59,781 --> 00:52:02,443
- No.
- Well, I'm out of here.

755
00:52:02,617 --> 00:52:05,085
I can still stop the order
with the kill code.

756
00:52:08,089 --> 00:52:10,785
-Sending kill code.
- I'm back.

757
00:52:10,959 --> 00:52:13,018
Got to get the button.

758
00:52:14,629 --> 00:52:15,721
Play. Fun. Fun. Play.

759
00:52:15,897 --> 00:52:20,527
Hey, Flint. It's been nice
to beet you.

760
00:52:21,336 --> 00:52:23,861
That's a radish.

761
00:52:45,493 --> 00:52:49,862
That was the only way
to communicate with the machine.

762
00:52:50,265 --> 00:52:51,994
What exactly did you order?

763
00:52:52,167 --> 00:52:56,160
A Vegas-style all-you-can-eat buffet.

764
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:01,731
Jellybean. Watermelon.
Marshmallow. Pretzel. Sushi.

765
00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:07,974
Cheeseburger. Pretzel. Egg salad.
Strawberry. Marshmallow.

766
00:53:09,918 --> 00:53:11,112
Strawberry.

767
00:53:16,090 --> 00:53:18,581
-ls everyone okay?
- Yeah.

768
00:53:25,266 --> 00:53:27,427
Help, somebody.

769
00:53:27,735 --> 00:53:29,669
Help me, please.

770
00:53:29,838 --> 00:53:31,601
It's my son.

771
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,605
We need a doctor.

772
00:53:33,775 --> 00:53:36,608
Is anyone here a doctor? Anyone?

773
00:53:36,778 --> 00:53:38,678
I am a doctor.

774
00:53:38,847 --> 00:53:39,871
You are?

775
00:53:40,048 --> 00:53:42,710
I was, back in Guatemala.

776
00:53:42,884 --> 00:53:44,818
I came here for a better life.

777
00:53:44,986 --> 00:53:46,180
Pretty great decision, eh?

778
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:52,690
How is he, doc?

779
00:53:54,762 --> 00:53:56,059
He's in a food coma.

780
00:53:57,599 --> 00:53:59,123
Too much junk food.

781
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:00,631
I need a celery, stat.

782
00:54:00,802 --> 00:54:02,531
Here you go.

783
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:09,273
-Daddy?
- Oh, Cal. Cal.

784
00:54:09,444 --> 00:54:11,912
I love you, son.

785
00:54:15,483 --> 00:54:17,542
Looks like everything
turned out okay.

786
00:54:17,719 --> 00:54:18,845
Not yet, it hasn't.

787
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:22,387
That twister was an amuse- bouche
compared to what's on the way.

788
00:54:22,557 --> 00:54:25,082
- What's an amuse- bouche?
-Manny, patch us through.

789
00:54:31,332 --> 00:54:32,492
Go.

790
00:54:32,667 --> 00:54:35,534
Cute report, Nancy.
Hey. Hey. Four-eyes.

791
00:54:35,703 --> 00:54:36,829
Can it, Patrick.

792
00:54:37,005 --> 00:54:40,338
We are about to be in the epicenter
of a perfect food storm.

793
00:54:40,508 --> 00:54:42,669
It's going to spread
across the globe.

794
00:54:43,144 --> 00:54:46,511
I've calculated the Coriolis
acceleration of the storm system.

795
00:54:46,681 --> 00:54:48,740
First, it'll hit New York...

796
00:54:48,917 --> 00:54:50,942
... then Paris...

797
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:54,020
... then the Jiayuguan Pass
in eastern China.

798
00:54:54,188 --> 00:54:59,990
And in four hours the entire northern
hemisphere will be one big potluck.

799
00:55:25,219 --> 00:55:26,686
Flint?

800
00:55:34,896 --> 00:55:36,227
Flint?

801
00:55:36,397 --> 00:55:37,455
Hey, Dad.

802
00:55:38,166 --> 00:55:39,758
What are you doing?

803
00:55:39,934 --> 00:55:42,596
Well, I tried to help everybody...

804
00:55:42,770 --> 00:55:46,729
...but instead I ruined everything.

805
00:55:47,308 --> 00:55:49,333
I'm just a piece of junk.

806
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:53,446
So I threw myself away.

807
00:55:53,881 --> 00:55:57,282
Along with all these
dumb inventions.

808
00:55:57,452 --> 00:55:59,317
This is junk.

809
00:56:00,054 --> 00:56:02,147
This is junk.

810
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:06,151
This is junk.

811
00:56:07,028 --> 00:56:10,862
Oh, son. Listen, when your boat is,
when it's listing...

812
00:56:11,032 --> 00:56:13,500
...and if it's not running,
you know--

813
00:56:13,668 --> 00:56:15,898
Don't worry, Dad, I get it.

814
00:56:16,070 --> 00:56:18,538
Mom was wrong about me.

815
00:56:19,607 --> 00:56:21,598
I'm not an inventor.

816
00:56:22,744 --> 00:56:25,178
I should've just quit when you said.

817
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:34,253
Well...

818
00:56:35,156 --> 00:56:38,887
...when it rains, you put on a coat.

819
00:56:39,293 --> 00:56:43,923
Dad, you know I don't understand
fishing metapho--

820
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,024
What?

821
00:56:51,139 --> 00:56:52,197
My coat.

822
00:57:02,717 --> 00:57:07,017
Come on, Steve.
We've got diem to carpe.

823
00:57:13,761 --> 00:57:15,023
Kill code downloading.

824
00:57:17,532 --> 00:57:19,898
Redesigning. Virtualizing.

825
00:57:20,068 --> 00:57:21,660
Cutting.

826
00:57:22,336 --> 00:57:24,827
Welding. Forging.

827
00:57:25,006 --> 00:57:26,906
-Wiring.
-Helping.

828
00:57:27,075 --> 00:57:28,702
Testing.

829
00:57:29,911 --> 00:57:31,845
Yes.

830
00:57:35,283 --> 00:57:37,513
Flying Car 2.

831
00:57:37,685 --> 00:57:40,381
Now with wings.

832
00:57:50,932 --> 00:57:53,958
Hey, I had a weird dream
like this once.

833
00:57:54,402 --> 00:57:56,962
I have a macaroni
on my head.

834
00:57:58,306 --> 00:57:59,830
Run.

835
00:58:05,179 --> 00:58:06,305
No school!

836
00:58:11,385 --> 00:58:15,549
Still nothing, nothing in the bottom of
the third inning.

837
00:58:23,464 --> 00:58:24,658
Everyone.

838
00:58:26,734 --> 00:58:28,759
I want to apologize.

839
00:58:30,238 --> 00:58:32,263
Especially to you, Sam.

840
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:34,567
But I have a plan.

841
00:58:34,742 --> 00:58:37,176
This flash drive contains a kill code.

842
00:58:37,345 --> 00:58:40,678
I will fly up into that food storm,
plug it into the machine...

843
00:58:40,848 --> 00:58:42,782
...and shut it down forever...

844
00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:45,316
...while you guys evacuate
the island, using brea--

845
00:58:45,486 --> 00:58:47,283
This is all his fault. Get him.

846
00:58:47,455 --> 00:58:48,479
There he is! Get him!

847
00:58:48,656 --> 00:58:49,680
Get Flint.

848
00:58:49,857 --> 00:58:52,951
Let's rock his car back and forth.

849
00:58:57,832 --> 00:58:59,800
Hey!

850
00:59:00,334 --> 00:59:03,235
This mess we're in
is all our faults.

851
00:59:04,705 --> 00:59:07,572
Me, I didn't even protect
my own son.

852
00:59:07,742 --> 00:59:10,210
Look, I'm as mad at Flint as you are.

853
00:59:10,378 --> 00:59:14,712
In fact, when he gets out of that car,
I'm gonna slap him in the face.

854
00:59:14,882 --> 00:59:18,978
I know Flint Lockwood made the food,
but it was made- to- order.

855
00:59:19,153 --> 00:59:22,020
And now it's time for all of us
to pay the bill.

856
00:59:32,633 --> 00:59:34,464
Thank you, Earl.

857
00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:37,331
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

858
00:59:37,505 --> 00:59:41,498
-Let's go build some boats.
- Yeah.

859
00:59:42,043 --> 00:59:43,840
I'm gonna go build a boat.

860
00:59:45,446 --> 00:59:46,470
I'm coming with you.

861
00:59:47,415 --> 00:59:50,748
You're gonna need someone
to navigate you through that storm.

862
00:59:51,719 --> 00:59:53,152
I can't let you do this alone.

863
00:59:53,321 --> 00:59:56,051
-Oh, Sam, I'm so sorry.
-Are you kidding?

864
00:59:56,224 --> 00:59:58,055
-Well, I just thought that we--
- No.

865
00:59:58,226 --> 00:59:59,250
Okay.

866
00:59:59,427 --> 01:00:02,191
-You are going to need a copilot.
-You're a pilot too?

867
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:05,064
Yes. I am also a particle physicist.

868
01:00:05,233 --> 01:00:07,292
-Really?
-No, that was a joke.

869
01:00:07,468 --> 01:00:08,492
I am also a comedian.

870
01:00:11,005 --> 01:00:13,872
-Let's do this thing.
-I'm coming too.

871
01:00:14,041 --> 01:00:16,134
Brent, that's okay.

872
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:19,404
No, it's not okay.

873
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:23,209
I've been coasting on my fame
since I was a baby.

874
01:00:23,384 --> 01:00:26,285
But it was all just an illusion.

875
01:00:26,454 --> 01:00:30,550
Maybe up there
I'll find out who I really am.

876
01:00:31,292 --> 01:00:33,920
The car's pretty full, so....

877
01:00:35,062 --> 01:00:36,495
Yeah.

878
01:00:36,664 --> 01:00:37,790
Brent.

879
01:00:37,965 --> 01:00:39,694
Okay.

880
01:00:52,246 --> 01:00:54,077
Good luck, son.

881
01:01:01,522 --> 01:01:03,922
Steve.

882
01:01:05,293 --> 01:01:06,624
Pea-soup fog.

883
01:01:06,794 --> 01:01:09,354
Manny, hit the wipers.

884
01:01:12,199 --> 01:01:15,635
There's massive gastro-precipitation
accumulated around the machine.

885
01:01:17,004 --> 01:01:18,869
It's almost as if it's....

886
01:01:19,206 --> 01:01:22,505
Inside a giant meatball.

887
01:01:26,614 --> 01:01:28,741
Water goes in the top...

888
01:01:28,916 --> 01:01:32,818
...a food hurricane
comes out the bottom.

889
01:01:33,254 --> 01:01:35,119
Glad I'm wearing a diaper.

890
01:01:51,839 --> 01:01:54,034
Anybody order pizza?

891
01:01:54,475 --> 01:01:56,500
Hold on.

892
01:01:56,677 --> 01:01:58,611
The pizza's chasing us?

893
01:01:58,779 --> 01:02:00,679
Sentient food? That's impossible.

894
01:02:00,848 --> 01:02:03,783
Unless its molecular structure's
mutated into super food!

895
01:02:03,951 --> 01:02:07,352
That's been genetically engineered
to protect the FLDSMDFR.

896
01:02:07,521 --> 01:02:09,216
Pizza.

897
01:02:09,390 --> 01:02:11,620
Pizza. Pizza. Pizza.

898
01:02:14,695 --> 01:02:19,029
That was close. I mean, can you
imagine if we lost this kill code?

899
01:02:25,639 --> 01:02:26,901
-Tim's Tackle Shop.
- Dad.

900
01:02:27,074 --> 01:02:28,735
You're okay, great.

901
01:02:28,909 --> 01:02:31,434
I need a favor. The fate of the world
depends on it!

902
01:02:31,612 --> 01:02:33,671
Okay, then, skipper.
What do you need?

903
01:02:33,848 --> 01:02:38,080
Go into my lab, get on my computer
and e-mail a file to my cell phone.

904
01:02:45,659 --> 01:02:46,683
All right.

905
01:02:52,066 --> 01:02:54,057
- Want me to drive?
-Yeah, okay.

906
01:03:06,981 --> 01:03:08,949
You're a lot better than me.

907
01:03:15,089 --> 01:03:16,215
Okay, here's the plan:

908
01:03:16,390 --> 01:03:19,188
Sam and I will enter the meateroid
through the intake here...

909
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:21,692
...which should lead us straight
to the FLDSMDFR.

910
01:03:21,862 --> 01:03:24,592
Manny, you and Steve stay on the
plane. Don't spray that.

911
01:03:24,765 --> 01:03:27,825
Once my dad e-mails me the kill code,
we'll destroy the machine...

912
01:03:28,002 --> 01:03:30,300
...and rendezvous
at the western blowhole in- -

913
01:03:30,471 --> 01:03:32,996
-How long until the world's destroyed?
-Twenty minutes.

914
01:03:33,174 --> 01:03:34,198
Just before then.

915
01:03:34,375 --> 01:03:37,208
What about me, Brent?
What do I do?

916
01:03:37,778 --> 01:03:41,578
You can be president
of the back seat.

917
01:03:43,384 --> 01:03:44,442
Deploy hatch.

918
01:03:44,618 --> 01:03:47,815
Car upside down, go.

919
01:03:49,256 --> 01:03:51,087
Ladies first?

920
01:03:51,559 --> 01:03:53,049
No?

921
01:03:53,227 --> 01:03:54,660
All right.

922
01:03:55,763 --> 01:03:57,890
Wait for me.

923
01:03:58,065 --> 01:04:00,090
Great. Okay, I'm good.

924
01:04:02,436 --> 01:04:06,338
As long as we stay on course,
it should be a straight shot to the--

925
01:04:08,542 --> 01:04:10,271
Yeah!

926
01:04:13,647 --> 01:04:15,672
We're a team.

927
01:04:28,329 --> 01:04:30,797
We've landed here
in some kind of exhaust vent.

928
01:04:30,965 --> 01:04:34,867
If we go this way, the Flamidabager
should be right down this air shaft.

929
01:04:35,035 --> 01:04:36,764
Brent, get out of that pie.

930
01:04:36,937 --> 01:04:38,165
What's that?

931
01:04:51,352 --> 01:04:53,115
Oh, boy.

932
01:05:00,161 --> 01:05:02,493
Welcome, Flint.

933
01:05:11,672 --> 01:05:13,697
That's fry oil.

934
01:05:20,347 --> 01:05:21,780
Flint, you have a call.

935
01:05:21,949 --> 01:05:23,177
Flint, you have a--

936
01:05:23,350 --> 01:05:24,874
Dad. Oh, okay, great.

937
01:05:25,052 --> 01:05:27,816
On the screen there's a file
marked "kill code."

938
01:05:27,988 --> 01:05:30,650
- Wha- -?
-Move that into my e-mail window...

939
01:05:31,625 --> 01:05:33,889
...type in my name, and press send.

940
01:05:36,363 --> 01:05:37,387
- Window?
-Okay, Dad...

941
01:05:37,565 --> 01:05:40,557
...you see the thing that looks like
a little piece of paper?

942
01:05:40,734 --> 01:05:42,224
Use the mouse to drag it.

943
01:05:42,436 --> 01:05:44,404
-Drag it? Drag it.
-Drag it. Drag it.

944
01:05:44,605 --> 01:05:47,096
Right? Okay. Great. Okay, great.

945
01:05:47,274 --> 01:05:48,673
It's not dragging.

946
01:05:48,842 --> 01:05:50,867
Drag it across the desktop.

947
01:05:53,814 --> 01:05:56,942
-That didn't do anything.
- Of course it didn't! You know what?

948
01:06:01,088 --> 01:06:02,112
Go, go, go.

949
01:06:02,289 --> 01:06:04,553
Hoist those sails. Toast that bread.

950
01:06:04,959 --> 01:06:06,756
We are running out of time.

951
01:06:10,431 --> 01:06:12,490
Let's move out. Go, go, go.

952
01:06:12,666 --> 01:06:14,497
We can do it.
Come on, move it, move it.

953
01:06:14,668 --> 01:06:18,001
Good job. That's what I'm talking
about. Everybody head to the docks.

954
01:06:24,945 --> 01:06:26,276
Wait, wait.

955
01:06:26,447 --> 01:06:28,915
I have an important announcement.

956
01:06:30,484 --> 01:06:31,781
See you, suckers.

957
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:33,985
Bon voyage.

958
01:06:34,855 --> 01:06:37,653
And bon appetit.

959
01:06:45,633 --> 01:06:48,067
- Cal.
- Calvin.

960
01:06:57,544 --> 01:06:59,171
Cal, get back here.

961
01:07:05,519 --> 01:07:08,147
- Foodalanche.
- Cal.

962
01:07:08,322 --> 01:07:09,983
I'm not gonna lose you again.

963
01:07:10,157 --> 01:07:11,886
Baby.

964
01:07:16,330 --> 01:07:18,525
Hold on tight, Calvin.

965
01:07:51,198 --> 01:07:55,225
Everybody head south.
We gotta stay ahead of that storm.

966
01:07:58,305 --> 01:07:59,897
- Now what?
- Just click "send."

967
01:08:00,074 --> 01:08:02,508
Flint, the Fliminadifiserser's
right down there!

968
01:08:02,710 --> 01:08:06,009
-Dad, hurry.
- Send. Send.

969
01:08:06,180 --> 01:08:07,545
Oh, wait.

970
01:08:10,751 --> 01:08:12,719
Dad? Dad? Can you hear me?

971
01:08:13,287 --> 01:08:14,948
Dad?

972
01:08:15,489 --> 01:08:16,683
Hey, guys?

973
01:08:21,929 --> 01:08:24,762
Holy crap balls.

974
01:08:25,199 --> 01:08:26,962
Go, go, go.

975
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:35,608
I don't know.
I think they're kind of cute.

976
01:08:35,776 --> 01:08:38,040
I mean, this one just walked
right up to me and--

977
01:08:38,212 --> 01:08:39,736
He's got me!

978
01:08:41,682 --> 01:08:43,343
-They ate Brent.
-They ate Brent.

979
01:08:44,485 --> 01:08:48,421
Dad, I'm surrounded
by man-eating chickens right now.

980
01:08:49,490 --> 01:08:50,787
So if this is goodbye...

981
01:08:52,226 --> 01:08:54,592
...thanks for trying
to set me straight.

982
01:08:55,129 --> 01:08:57,723
Figured it out a little late, I guess.

983
01:08:58,732 --> 01:09:00,324
Okay, bye.

984
01:09:18,519 --> 01:09:20,111
Dad.

985
01:09:21,822 --> 01:09:24,552
Hey, give me that phone back.

986
01:09:42,709 --> 01:09:43,903
Baby Brent?

987
01:09:44,077 --> 01:09:47,103
I'm not Baby Brent anymore.

988
01:09:47,281 --> 01:09:50,079
I'm Chicken Brent.

989
01:09:50,250 --> 01:09:54,186
And I'm finally contributing
to society.

990
01:09:54,354 --> 01:09:56,185
Crotch kick.

991
01:10:02,262 --> 01:10:06,494
Now go, you crazy kids,
and save the world.

992
01:10:06,667 --> 01:10:09,329
You did it, Chicken Brent.
You really did it.

993
01:10:09,503 --> 01:10:11,471
Go, go, go.

994
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:15,631
It should be right down this hole.

995
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:19,135
That's peanut brittle.

996
01:10:20,948 --> 01:10:24,384
If either one of us touches it,
we'll go into anaphylactic shock.

997
01:10:24,852 --> 01:10:27,286
Actually, I'm not entirely allergic
to peanuts.

998
01:10:27,454 --> 01:10:31,151
I might have just said that
to get you to like me.

999
01:10:31,325 --> 01:10:35,489
So you really thought having allergies
would make you more attractive?

1000
01:10:39,032 --> 01:10:40,897
Mustache.

1001
01:10:41,068 --> 01:10:42,695
Mus- -

1002
01:10:51,144 --> 01:10:53,635
-Sesame bagel.
-Hey, taxi.

1003
01:10:53,814 --> 01:10:55,645
- Taxi.
- Taxi.

1004
01:10:55,816 --> 01:10:58,478
I asked for extra mustard.

1005
01:11:04,458 --> 01:11:06,926
I was right.

1006
01:11:16,270 --> 01:11:17,498
Hot tea?

1007
01:11:17,671 --> 01:11:19,696
Did he say hot tea?

1008
01:11:21,008 --> 01:11:24,637
"You are about to be crushed
by a giant corn."

1009
01:11:24,811 --> 01:11:26,472
Run.

1010
01:11:28,615 --> 01:11:31,516
It looks like the food storm
is following an unusual pattern...

1011
01:11:31,685 --> 01:11:34,017
...of hitting the world's
famous landmarks first...

1012
01:11:34,187 --> 01:11:37,315
...and is now spreading
to the rest of the globe.

1013
01:11:38,959 --> 01:11:40,051
What the what?

1014
01:11:40,227 --> 01:11:42,752
Hurry up, guys.

1015
01:11:42,963 --> 01:11:45,761
After I plug my phone into
the FLDSMDFR and destroy it...

1016
01:11:45,933 --> 01:11:49,699
...I'll tug on the licorice twice
and you'll pull me back up, okay?

1017
01:11:50,103 --> 01:11:51,798
Sounds great.

1018
01:12:02,282 --> 01:12:03,544
Oh, no.

1019
01:12:08,589 --> 01:12:09,954
You got cut, didn't you?

1020
01:12:11,325 --> 01:12:13,088
It's just a scratch.

1021
01:12:14,261 --> 01:12:17,958
Brent, you need to take Sam back to
the plane to get her an allergy shot.

1022
01:12:18,131 --> 01:12:19,291
Just a second.

1023
01:12:19,466 --> 01:12:20,728
What? No.

1024
01:12:21,201 --> 01:12:24,261
-Let go, Sam.
-I'm not gonna let you go.

1025
01:12:24,438 --> 01:12:27,305
Flint, you'll be stuck down there.

1026
01:12:27,474 --> 01:12:29,635
It's not ideal, no.

1027
01:12:30,243 --> 01:12:32,643
Come with us. We'll start over.

1028
01:12:32,813 --> 01:12:36,249
We'll live underground.
Use bacon for clothes.

1029
01:12:36,416 --> 01:12:38,179
Sam, that's not a very good plan.

1030
01:12:38,352 --> 01:12:40,980
It is if it means
I don't have to lose you.

1031
01:12:41,755 --> 01:12:44,087
Look, I like you, okay?

1032
01:12:45,559 --> 01:12:48,289
Like- -  Like, as a friend?

1033
01:12:48,462 --> 01:12:50,259
No.

1034
01:12:50,464 --> 01:12:53,126
Like, "like you" like you.

1035
01:12:55,836 --> 01:12:57,531
Me too.

1036
01:12:59,206 --> 01:13:01,197
But about you.

1037
01:13:06,613 --> 01:13:07,671
Goodbye, Sam.

1038
01:13:07,848 --> 01:13:10,373
Flint. No.

1039
01:13:10,550 --> 01:13:11,812
Hang on, Sam.

1040
01:13:11,985 --> 01:13:14,886
Dr. Manny's got the medicine
for your face.

1041
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:22,021
Pickles.

1042
01:13:23,497 --> 01:13:24,691
Beets.

1043
01:13:24,865 --> 01:13:27,265
Banana.

1044
01:13:27,434 --> 01:13:30,130
Strawberry.

1045
01:13:41,415 --> 01:13:44,384
-Manny, we're on our way. Hurry.
-Hang on, Sam.

1046
01:13:44,551 --> 01:13:46,917
I'm circling the blowhole.

1047
01:13:50,824 --> 01:13:51,848
Scared.

1048
01:14:03,003 --> 01:14:04,027
Gummi Bears.

1049
01:14:04,204 --> 01:14:06,695
Play with us, play with us.
Eat us, eat us.

1050
01:14:07,841 --> 01:14:09,206
Hungry.

1051
01:14:09,976 --> 01:14:13,173
Hungry. Gummi Bears. Gummi Bears.
Gummi Bears. Steve hungry. Hungry.

1052
01:14:13,346 --> 01:14:15,405
Steve starving. Hungry.
Hungry. Starving.

1053
01:14:22,122 --> 01:14:24,283
Manny. Where are you?

1054
01:14:48,181 --> 01:14:50,308
-She touched a peanut or something.
-Oh, boy.

1055
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:02,118
Corn.

1056
01:15:36,730 --> 01:15:37,754
Grabbing.

1057
01:15:38,298 --> 01:15:40,266
Tying. Throwing.

1058
01:15:43,236 --> 01:15:45,033
Waiting.

1059
01:15:47,107 --> 01:15:48,131
Swinging.

1060
01:15:57,350 --> 01:16:00,217
Sorry, old friend.
The kitchen's closed.

1061
01:16:04,925 --> 01:16:05,949
Fight the power!

1062
01:16:06,359 --> 01:16:07,451
Dad.

1063
01:16:07,627 --> 01:16:08,821
No.

1064
01:16:49,836 --> 01:16:54,205
When it rains, you put on a coat...

1065
01:16:54,374 --> 01:16:56,399
...of Spray-On Shoes.

1066
01:16:58,745 --> 01:17:01,407
Yeah.

1067
01:17:16,263 --> 01:17:18,925
Just- -  There were chickens- -

1068
01:17:19,099 --> 01:17:20,191
Where's Flint?

1069
01:17:23,870 --> 01:17:25,497
No!

1070
01:17:26,139 --> 01:17:27,834
I know, kid.

1071
01:17:28,008 --> 01:17:29,270
I know.

1072
01:17:38,485 --> 01:17:40,749
- Cool.
-Yeah. All right.

1073
01:18:18,525 --> 01:18:19,856
Flint?

1074
01:18:23,029 --> 01:18:24,428
I'm sorry.

1075
01:18:42,849 --> 01:18:45,579
Your son was a great man.

1076
01:19:10,810 --> 01:19:13,574
- Steve.
- Steve.

1077
01:19:13,747 --> 01:19:15,408
- Flint.
- Brent.

1078
01:19:15,582 --> 01:19:17,140
- Flint.
- Cal.

1079
01:19:17,317 --> 01:19:18,409
- Steve.
- Flint.

1080
01:19:18,585 --> 01:19:19,813
- Earl.
- Flint.

1081
01:19:19,986 --> 01:19:22,318
-You guy.
- Steve.

1082
01:19:24,691 --> 01:19:25,919
Sam.

1083
01:19:26,092 --> 01:19:27,252
Flint.

1084
01:19:28,228 --> 01:19:29,320
Sam.

1085
01:19:29,496 --> 01:19:31,191
- Flint.
- Flint.

1086
01:19:31,364 --> 01:19:32,695
- Dad.
- Steve.

1087
01:19:32,866 --> 01:19:34,663
Flint.

1088
01:19:38,505 --> 01:19:42,464
Look, when you--
When you cast your line...

1089
01:19:42,642 --> 01:19:46,442
...if it's not straight--

1090
01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:49,375
Oh, for crying out loud.

1091
01:19:53,219 --> 01:19:55,084
I'm proud of you, Flint.

1092
01:19:55,655 --> 01:19:58,283
I'm amazed that someone
as ordinary as me...

1093
01:19:58,458 --> 01:20:02,519
...could be the father of someone
as extraordinary as you.

1094
01:20:02,695 --> 01:20:05,994
You're talented,
you're a total original.

1095
01:20:06,166 --> 01:20:08,999
And your lab is breathtaking.

1096
01:20:09,169 --> 01:20:12,161
Your mom, she always knew
you were going to be special.

1097
01:20:12,338 --> 01:20:15,432
And if she were alive today,
she'd tell us both;

1098
01:20:15,608 --> 01:20:17,769
"I told you so. "

1099
01:20:18,711 --> 01:20:21,805
Now, look,
when I take this thing off...

1100
01:20:21,981 --> 01:20:25,439
...and you hear me
make a fishing metaphor...

1101
01:20:26,219 --> 01:20:29,120
...just know
that fishing metaphor means;

1102
01:20:29,289 --> 01:20:31,120
I love my son.

1103
01:20:31,291 --> 01:20:33,589
I love you too, Dad.

1104
01:20:44,671 --> 01:20:46,536
So where were we?

1105
01:20:46,706 --> 01:20:48,503
You were about to kiss me.

1106
01:20:48,675 --> 01:20:50,700
Were you gonna kiss me back?

1107
01:20:50,877 --> 01:20:52,367
Why don't you find out?

1108
01:20:52,545 --> 01:20:55,446
Because I don't want to go for it and
then get shut down again.

1109
01:20:55,615 --> 01:20:57,378
- Just kiss me.
- You know- -

1110
01:21:07,327 --> 01:21:10,524
Yeah. I'm a chicken.

1111
01:21:28,481 --> 01:21:32,281
This was not well thought out.
