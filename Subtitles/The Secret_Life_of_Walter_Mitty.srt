1
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,070
Huh?

2
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,041
<i>Hi! Todd Mahar,</i>
<i>eHarmony.</i>

3
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,702
<i>How can I help</i>
<i>you today?</i>

4
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,463
Hi. I can't seem to leave
a wink for someone.

5
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:37,874
I don't know,
is my page broken?

6
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,963
Do I maybe have
a broken page, or--

7
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:42,345
<i>I've never heard</i>
<i>of that, but, okay.</i>

8
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:44,914
<i>You're trying to use your</i>
<i>eHarmony account</i>
<i>for the first time?</i>

9
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:46,344
I am.
<i>Okay.</i>

10
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:48,851
<i>I'm looking</i>
<i>at your profile.</i>

11
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,012
<i>We have a pretty intricate</i>
<i>matching algorithm.</i>

12
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:54,057
<i>That's what distinguishes</i>
<i>us from other online</i>
<i>dating services.</i>

13
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,395
Yeah, I like that.

14
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,815
Actually,
I'm just trying to leave
a wink for one person.

15
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:00,480
Cheryl Melhoff.

16
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:03,240
She started in my
division at work
about a month ago...

17
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,653
and I overheard her
near the bagels saying
she was on your site.

18
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,366
<i>Okay, that's unique.</i>

19
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,540
<i>But let me ask you.</i>

20
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,165
<i>You left a lot</i>
<i>of this stuff...</i>

21
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:15,203
<i>like the "Been There,</i>
<i>Done That" section,</i>
<i>you left it blank.</i>

22
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,087
Yeah, I think
I skipped it.

23
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,043
<i>Okay, you got to</i>
<i>help me out here, man.</i>

24
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,583
<i>Don't skip stuff.</i>

25
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,178
Okay, well, I haven't
really been

26
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:26,764
anywhere noteworthy
or mentionable.

27
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:31,724
<i>Have you done</i>
<i>anything noteworthy,</i>
<i>mentionable?</i>

28
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,187
<i>Hello, you still there?</i>

29
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,398
Can you hang on
a second?

30
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,239
Go, go, go!
Get out! Get out!

31
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:54,204
She's gonna blow! Go! Go!

32
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:57,961
Chips!
Over here!

33
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,123
Chips! Thank you!

34
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,381
How did you know
about the building?

35
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,258
I heard barking,
thought I smelled gas.

36
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:04,635
I hope it's okay.

37
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,341
I engineered
a prosthesis for Chips

38
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,074
while I was sprinting
down the stairwell.

39
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,632
A little hip-joint
assembly

40
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,888
with a drop-ring lock and
an anterior pelvic band.

41
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,556
God, you're noteworthy!

42
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,894
Adventurous, Brave, Creative.

43
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:18,987
That's
everything I want in a man.

44
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:22,613
<i>My man?</i>

45
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:24,568
<i>Hey, my man,</i>
<i>you still there?</i>

46
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:27,901
Hey.

47
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,236
<i>What? Did you</i>
<i>pass out or--</i>

48
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:32,534
No, I just like,
zoned out for a second.

49
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,915
<i>Okay. Do you</i>
<i>do that a lot?</i>

50
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:38,787
Normal amount,
I guess.

51
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:42,415
Yeah, I got
to run. Sorry.

52
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,128
<i>Okay, but</i>
<i>we need a lot more--</i>

53
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,918
Hey. Bad
day to be late.

54
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,458
We just got acquired.

55
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,342
What?
Yeah, over the weekend.

56
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,629
Walter!
Happy birthday!

57
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:30,764
Whoo-hoo!

58
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:32,841
He's 42 years old!

59
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,759
Odessa!
What are you doing here?

60
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:37,307
Mom made you
your favorite
clementine cake.

61
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,096
Aren't you supposed to be
at the retirement place

62
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,647
with her
getting the piano
moved in?

63
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,308
Yes, I was there.
It's like halfway done...

64
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:45,319
piano's out of the van,
it's on the street,
everything's fine.

65
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,089
But I just got
a phone call
about a really

66
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,814
big audition,
so can you go finish it?

67
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,029
No, I can't.
I'm late.
Walter, I...

68
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:53,660
I don't think
you're seeing this
from what I need.

69
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,946
What do you need?

70
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,331
I need to be
Rizzo in <i>Grease.</i>

71
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:58,873
I don't understand that.

72
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:01,286
My audition! Rizzo!
Rizzo?

73
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:03,420
Rizzo! She's
tough and tender!

74
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:04,506
Do me a favor, please.

75
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,955
Make sure Mom's piano
gets moved in all
the way. All right?

76
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:08,676
Don't go to Rizzo!

77
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:11,462
Oh, thanks, Walter.
Happy birthday!

78
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,552
Guess what?
We just got acquired.

79
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:14,850
Yeah, I heard.

80
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:16,218
Yeah, there's gonna
be changes.

81
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:19,891
Downsizing of us
into some kind of
dot-com thing, possibly.

82
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,811
I wonder how this
thing goes down,

83
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,855
how the transition's
gonna play out.

84
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,314
I could probably tell you.

85
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:30,323
Ted Hendricks,
managing director
of the transition.

86
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,534
Hey. Tim Naughton.
Sales.

87
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,196
Gary Mannheim,
graphic design.

88
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:40,162
And what do
you do, cake man?

89
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:41,627
Oh, uh...

90
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,797
The cake's just for today.
I'm not a cake man.

91
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,299
I do--

92
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,709
I deal dirctly--

93
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,211
"Dirctly"?

94
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:56,053
Directly with
<i>LIFE's</i> photo units...

95
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,218
I'm sorry, I was really
getting into this song

96
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,223
and I stopped
listening to you.

97
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:05,562
I was saying,
you know who
looks good in a beard?

98
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,397
Dumbledore, not you.

99
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,076
Guy?

100
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,322
Guy?

101
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,910
What do you do?

102
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,085
I'm a negative
asset manager.

103
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,418
Worth the wait.

104
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:31,926
<i>Mind over matter</i>

105
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,933
Ted.
Donny.

106
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,428
Feeling tough?
Feeling good.

107
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,688
Well, got to make
some tough calls ahead.

108
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,273
You been here
before, yeah?

109
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:47,401
Yeah, so this
is it, huh?

110
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:49,276
Yeah, the
"house of pictures."

111
00:08:58,872 --> 00:08:59,872
Hey.

112
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,869
Hi.
How was your weekend?

113
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,410
I had an awesome weekend.

114
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,935
And what did
you do this weekend?

115
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,096
Um... Let's see.

116
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:29,483
I bathed in Arctic
mountain water...

117
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,939
while my Latin lover
recited verse to me.

118
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,900
You slut.
I know.

119
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,987
Actually, I waited for
my refrigerator repairman,
who never came.

120
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,492
I'm so sorry.

121
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:39,661
I'm gonna
call you later.

122
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:40,788
Okay.

123
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,571
The ice, yes?

124
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,122
She moves like a woman.

125
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:51,998
I'm Walter. Mitty.

126
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,883
Cheryl. Melhoff.

127
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:56,294
Where have you been?

128
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:58,838
Testing the limits
of the human <i>espirit.</i>

129
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,975
I'd like to climb
your hair, test
that out.

130
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:07,058
Perhaps I can contact you,
possibly through
my poetry falcon.

131
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,556
Poetry falcon.

132
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:09,733
I like that.

133
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:17,239
Do you think,
if I hit him with
a paper clip, would he move?

134
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,444
I don't know.

135
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:19,651
Do it.

136
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,239
Hello.

137
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,745
I actually threw
a toner box at him once.

138
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:24,996
Yeah? Did he move?

139
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,623
No, I missed.

140
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:29,289
That's a great story.

141
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,128
Ground Control
to Major Tom.

142
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,374
Can you hear me,
Major Tom?

143
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,346
Oh!

144
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,515
Wow.

145
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,386
Moving on, as they say.

146
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:51,186
Conference room,
more of these stations here...

147
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,066
where people sort
of do their thing.

148
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,401
Layout's here for--

149
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:06,364
Morning, Hernando!

150
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,874
There's a new nut
pouch, did you hear?

151
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,829
Yeah. I met him.

152
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,292
We're gonna
be evaluated.

153
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:17,424
They won't be able to.
We do intricate
details back here.

154
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:18,594
Yeah.

155
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,423
It's tricky.
And bewildering.

156
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:22,930
I should evaluate you,
you should evaluate me.

157
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,539
I don't think
they'll let us do that.

158
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:25,678
Just saying.

159
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:32,807
Hey, how long has this
neg roll been here...
out in the open?

160
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,232
It says "Sean O'Connell."

161
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,067
It came in this morning.

162
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,108
There's a present, too.
He sent you a present,
on your desk.

163
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,694
Sean O'Connell
still shoots on film.

164
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,239
That results for
me in a man crush.

165
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:51,875
Hey, you want
to mount these?

166
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,209
Seriously?

167
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,620
Sure.

168
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:08,476
<i>Heard rumblings</i>
LIFE's <i>done, man.</i>

169
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:09,931
<i>Wanted to say thanks.</i>

170
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:14,148
<i>Take a look inside,</i>
<i>a gift for all</i>
<i>the years of hard work.</i>

171
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,142
<i>Sorry about the neg roll.</i>

172
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,727
<i>I spilled some blood on it...</i>

173
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:20,612
<i>while self-stitching</i>
<i>a gun wound to my abdomen...</i>

174
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:23,991
<i>but number 25 is my best ever.</i>

175
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,994
<i>The quintessence</i>
<i>of life, I think.</i>

176
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,325
<i>I trust you'll get it</i>
<i>where it needs to go...</i>

177
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,164
<i>you always do.</i>

178
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,604
What did you get?

179
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,189
It's a wallet.

180
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,532
With <i>LIFE's</i> motto on it.

181
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:15,288
Here you go.

182
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,550
Where's 25?
It's not there.

183
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:29,181
Hey, we need negative 25.

184
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:32,389
Sean O'Connell
sent a telegram.

185
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:33,562
An actual telegram.

186
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,687
A 100-year-old dude
came in a little hat.

187
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,273
So there's
a floor meeting.

188
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,851
Bring 25.

189
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:46,736
It's here somewhere.
We'll find it.

190
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,614
Okay, make a contact sheet
of these frames
as soon as you can.

191
00:13:49,693 --> 00:13:50,973
And don't say
anything to anyone.

192
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,078
Yeah.

193
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:56,329
I just wanted
to inform you all
reluctantly, that--

194
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:05,300
I guess, just start back
from the beginning.

195
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,588
Okay. I just wanted
to inform you
all reluctantly...

196
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:12,099
that this month's issue
will be our last.

197
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:13,850
What?

198
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:14,936
Yeah. What?

199
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,308
This is some bull!

200
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,143
It's sad...

201
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:22,442
...news, for sure.

202
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,105
Now, you're all
valued employees.

203
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:29,901
But as we
undergo this transition
to <i>LIFE</i> online...

204
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:31,614
we wanted to be
candid with you...

205
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:35,327
that some of you
will be determined
non-vital employees...

206
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,162
to the new partnership.

207
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:39,292
And we'll be deciding
which of those positions...

208
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:42,830
will be remaining with
us over the course
of the next week.

209
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:47,047
Also, we feel sad about
that, as you can see.

210
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:49,596
Now for some good news.

211
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:51,756
We are very excited--
All right, Don.

212
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:55,722
Ted Hendricks.
Managing director
of the transition.

213
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:59,263
Never fun,
this stage.

214
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:02,896
But we do have ahead of us
the privilege of publishing...

215
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:06,813
what will be
the very last issue
of <i>LIFE</i> magazine.

216
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:10,407
And for the final issue,
we just received a telegram.

217
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:11,529
Come on.

218
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,906
From Sean O'Connell...

219
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,242
who has never,
I'm told, been willing...

220
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,282
to speak with
the executives here.

221
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:19,995
Well, he broke
his long silence

222
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,751
and shared his
thoughts with us...

223
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,755
through that old man.

224
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,042
Sean O'Connell.

225
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:32,964
"I expect full consideration
of negative 25 for cover.

226
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,802
"My most grand.

227
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:38,310
"The quintessence of life."

228
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:40,805
What is that?

229
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,439
It means like
the fullest and
most rich.

230
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,896
Okay. So our cover will
probably be the most
famous ever...

231
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:49,563
because it really
will have the big
quintessence of all time.

232
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,949
Very full and so rich.

233
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:57,367
So let's see
this thing. Huh?

234
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,872
Let's see it.

235
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,749
Can we-- What am
I doing up here?
What's going on?

236
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,376
We'll receive it now
from Negative Assets.

237
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:04,787
This gentleman.
The last man in.

238
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,129
Negative Assets.
What's that?

239
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:07,335
Ah, Major Tom.

240
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,584
Can I get that?

241
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,255
It's being processed.

242
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:17,303
All right. Well,
let's do it.

243
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,844
Let's process
some quintessence.

244
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,229
Come on.

245
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,064
Go.

246
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:24,691
Now.

247
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,266
That's why I'm clapping.

248
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:28,401
When do we go to press?
Two and a half weeks.

249
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:43,376
Hi.

250
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:44,836
Hi.

251
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,622
I'm Walter.

252
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,207
Cheryl.
Melhoff.
Mitty.

253
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:51,671
Yes.

254
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,008
You work in Photo
Accounts, right?
I do.

255
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:57,263
Negative Assets.

256
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,765
Yes. I am.

257
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:01,769
You're processing
the last cover photo.
That's a big deal.

258
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:04,806
Yeah, it's... there's a...
we have a glitch.

259
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,439
Mini, on that
one right now.

260
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,145
I wanted to say,
to you...

261
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:12,859
do you maybe have
an address for
Sean O'Connell?

262
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:16,116
Um... It's not really
that easy with him.

263
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,864
He moves around
so much. I don't.

264
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,278
Yeah, he's on a freelance.

265
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:22,198
I don't know where
and he doesn't
have a phone.

266
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,833
No phone?
He's old school.
Yeah.

267
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,876
But, you know,
why don't I check
with Peg?

268
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,836
I know she just processed
a check for him.

269
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,797
And we could track
his pay-out maybe.
Find him that way?

270
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:38,256
Cool. Very cool.
Okay.

271
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,048
Walter.
Yes.

272
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:41,512
I'm on it.

273
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:42,847
Thanks.

274
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,101
Yes. Are you coming?

275
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:45,812
Yes, I'm not.

276
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,060
Yes, I have
to stay.

277
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,519
Here's the
contact sheet.

278
00:17:58,578 --> 00:17:59,785
What do you see?

279
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:02,071
This photo cluster.
These three.

280
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:03,955
They're the only
printable ones.

281
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,242
He took them
around the same time
he took 25.

282
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,960
They could give us a clue
to where Sean is.

283
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,130
Blow them up,
all right?

284
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:11,256
Cool.

285
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,184
Hey.

286
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,060
Walter, right?

287
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,026
Yeah.

288
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:37,281
So, I called Peg about Sean.
She's gonna get back to me.

289
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,024
Oh! Hey, thanks.

290
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,365
Cool glasses,
very Sand People.

291
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:45,781
These? No,
these are loupes.

292
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,540
They're for work.
They magnify the--

293
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,702
Is that 25? Can I see?

294
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:50,960
That's... No.

295
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:54,590
I can't quite
find 25...

296
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:56,250
just now.

297
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:57,918
You can't find it?

298
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,882
Yeah. That's why
I'm trying to find Sean.

299
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:04,221
I'm trying to
track him down somehow
with these other images.

300
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:06,392
His whereabouts?

301
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:07,723
Yeah.

302
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:12,224
I take this class,
Writing the Mystery Novel.

303
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:14,894
Anyway, they say the key
is to work backwards.

304
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:18,485
You connect the clues and
then scatter them so
they seem unrelated.

305
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,399
There's like a whole
science to it.

306
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,575
May I?
Sure.

307
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,746
Okay. Thumb.

308
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,748
Yeah. It's an
unknown thumb.

309
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:30,830
Okay. Water?

310
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,287
Just water, I guess?

311
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:34,500
Yeah, just water.

312
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:35,668
Okay.

313
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,173
And...

314
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:41,177
like a curved piece of...

315
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:45,136
some kind of,
part of a thing.

316
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,428
But the thing with clues,
my teacher says...

317
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:52,125
is you really only
need one good one,
and then they'll connect...

318
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:55,017
and you'll be like,
"Oh, yes, of course,
unknown thumb, water...

319
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,527
"I should have seen this
the whole time. Ahh!"

320
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,985
Yeah, yeah,
I'll be like...

321
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:09,161
Well, anyway, I should
get back and try
not to get fired.

322
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,130
Hey, Cheryl.

323
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:19,548
I have something creative
I've been working on, too.

324
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:20,635
Oh.

325
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,586
Little side project.

326
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,392
Walter, it's amazing!

327
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:31,390
Walter?

328
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,756
I was just saying I'll
let you know when
I hear back from Peg.

329
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:37,567
Okay. Thank you.

330
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:38,984
Okay.

331
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:47,702
Hey, Odessa.

332
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,406
What?

333
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:02,042
Is there a larger
apartment available
the piano could fit in?

334
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:04,545
Because it's
a memento of our mom's.

335
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:06,839
That's a really big--

336
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:10,301
Most people sell
their really big mementos
before they move here.

337
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:12,811
My dad bought it for her
the year they were married.

338
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,142
It means a lot to her.

339
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,065
That's a villa.
It's a little
more costly...

340
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:21,694
but it has a more generous,
piano kind of size
living room for you though.

341
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,230
Yeah. Yeah,
this is good.

342
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:24,656
On move-in,
you'd need first month's,

343
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:25,984
last month's,
and full deposit.

344
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,859
That's $4,700.
Great.

345
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:29,240
Yeah, okay.

346
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,696
Yeah, we'll take it.
I'll get the paperwork.

347
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,907
The new villa comes
open in three weeks.

348
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,199
I'm guessing.

349
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,123
Happy birthday.

350
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:42,045
Stretch Armstrong!

351
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:43,459
That's cool.

352
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:44,880
Yeah. Isn't
that awesome?

353
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:47,637
This was your favorite
thing when we were little.
Do you remember?

354
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:49,048
You want to do it?

355
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:50,225
Yeah, all right.

356
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:53,135
Come on, Stretch!
Good, good!

357
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,312
Come on, we got to go.

358
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,393
A villa, okay,
but hey, I'm not the
Queen of Sheba.

359
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:58,966
You got to have
room for your piano.

360
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,395
You can stay at my place
until it's ready.

361
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,561
I won't be cramping
your scene?

362
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,070
My scene? No.

363
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,960
And sorry we couldn't
get you in here today.

364
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:07,075
Walter!

365
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:09,235
Look what I found!

366
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,653
This is from you
and Tim Linderman.

367
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:14,073
Do you remember,
we were gonna
backpack Europe?

368
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,582
That June Dad died?

369
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,959
Man! What is in here?

370
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:19,289
That's my Walter box.

371
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,955
Some of my Walter
knick-knacks and keepsakes.

372
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,381
You made the
best mix tapes!

373
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:27,085
Oh, man.
What? What's that?

374
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:29,425
Travel journal Dad gave me.

375
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:30,557
Oh.

376
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:33,551
You should donate that,
because you never
used it, to a poor kid.

377
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,719
A poor kid who's
gonna travel to Europe?

378
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,728
Look at you
and your dad!

379
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:38,934
Is that my
tournament one?

380
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:40,895
He was so proud of this.

381
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:45,320
Sharing your accomplishments
with the whole world.

382
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,773
It's from the
<i>Fairview Smalltowner,</i> Mom.

383
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:50,613
Well, I really
liked that nifty mohawk.

384
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,400
You know, when
your daddy died...

385
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,616
and then you went to work
in that pizza place...

386
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:58,283
the one that was
named after a father,
had that father kind of name.

387
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,377
Papa John's.

388
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:00,461
Yeah, delivery.

389
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:03,417
And I thought perhaps
that it was
really sad for you...

390
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:05,339
working in
a restaurant
named after a father

391
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:07,133
after your father just died.

392
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:09,886
I never even
thought about that.

393
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,922
Probably because
I didn't call Dad "Papa."

394
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,636
You had a weird style.

395
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,223
That wasn't my style.
That was a uniform. KFC.

396
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,562
My worker bee.

397
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:24,643
"Word in the water"?

398
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,436
Okay, you know what?
I got to go.

399
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:28,606
We're getting
you into a villa
situation, okay?

400
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:29,943
Okay.
Good, everybody?

401
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,153
My worker bee...

402
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:33,087
and my performance
artist bee!
Thank you, Mom.

403
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,158
Hernando.
Hey.

404
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:43,662
I don't see anything.
Upper middle.

405
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,671
It's faint.
There's a word
in the water.

406
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,004
I'm getting
nervous, Walter.

407
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:56,974
Hey, this
is an ocean.

408
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:58,680
That's a boat.

409
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:01,638
"Erkigsnek."

410
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,932
He was near this boat.

411
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:06,316
See you in a few.

412
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:07,728
I'll check the mailroom.

413
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:16,695
Final cover.

414
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,197
Big responsibility.

415
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:21,791
Oh, is that
my quintessence?

416
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,752
No.

417
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:27,695
We're prepping
the wetting agents on that
to start the process.

418
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:30,549
Really? Because it
looks like you're
playing with toys.

419
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:34,380
No, this is a gift.

420
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,757
Yeah, the negative
needs to go through
a very technical--

421
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:39,643
I'm sorry. I can't have
a professional
conversation with you.

422
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:42,429
You and your
little blonde pal.

423
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:44,774
Let's--

424
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,771
You can't walk
through the office
with him.

425
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:49,732
Let's have it.
I'll put it away.

426
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,150
Give me the toy, man!
No!

427
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,610
Now.

428
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:57,198
This is a place
of business, not a place
of jelly-man toys!

429
00:24:57,371 --> 00:24:58,407
Get off it!

430
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,580
No, I'm taking it!

431
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,114
You can't just
take my stuff!

432
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:02,907
It's mine!
Give it to me!

433
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:04,085
No!

434
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:20,433
Stop fiddling with sweets
and little men!

435
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:23,015
I'm trying to do my job!

436
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,114
Are you the Tin Man?

437
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:27,959
Need a little oil can?

438
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:29,706
Jesus.

439
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:32,755
Picture.

440
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,381
- Hello?
<i>- Hey!</i>

441
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,841
Hey.
<i>What's up?</i>

442
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:46,261
Who is this?
<i>Todd.</i>

443
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,438
<i>From eHarmony.</i>

444
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:48,730
Oh! Hi.

445
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:50,063
<i>When I lost you there,</i>
<i>I was saying...</i>

446
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:53,227
<i>we need to beef</i>
<i>your profile up,</i>
<i>make it, you know, not blank.</i>

447
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:55,861
<i>Real quick, let's build your</i>
<i>"Been There, Done Thats."</i>

448
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:58,865
Okay. Been there...

449
00:26:58,951 --> 00:26:59,951
Um...

450
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:01,780
Phoenix.

451
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:03,445
I forgot why.

452
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:04,658
Then Nashville...

453
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,993
but that was just
the airport on the way

454
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:07,565
to Phoenix,
so I don't know if that--

455
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:08,626
<i>Uh-huh...</i>

456
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:11,870
<i>Hey, man, I was thinking,</i>
<i>if you work with this girl...</i>

457
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:15,670
<i>why don't you just</i>
<i>humanly invite her out?</i>

458
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:18,592
No, no, no, I'm trying
to do like a "Piña
Colada Song" thing.

459
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:19,923
<i>"Piña Colada Song"?</i>

460
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:22,298
Yeah, you know,
a guy posts an ad,
looking for a lover...

461
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,548
and then his
wife answers it...

462
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:26,012
and it turns out
they were soul mates
and didn't even know it...

463
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:29,429
and they end up
making love in capes,
or on a cape.

464
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:32,223
<i>It's a song?</i>
<i>Can you sing</i>
<i>a little bit?</i>

465
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:35,894
<i>If you like piña coladas,</i>
<i>getting caught in the rain</i>

466
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,152
You know that song?
I have to go.

467
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:38,362
<i>Is that Hall & Oates?</i>

468
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,402
Hey!
Hey.

469
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:41,692
Is that another clue?

470
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:43,360
Yeah. This one's okay.
Yeah?

471
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:45,991
There's a boat
there, I think.

472
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,748
"Erkig--"
Snek.

473
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,249
Erkigsnek?
Yeah.

474
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:51,500
Sounds like a real clue.

475
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,081
Yeah, it's the
boat's name.

476
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:54,371
Have you Googled it?

477
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:55,587
I was on my way to.

478
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:58,003
Yeah. N-U.

479
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:01,136
It's the first two letters
of the port city.

480
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:04,089
Buffering.

481
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:07,183
So, the park...

482
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,093
I got to run up there
and pick up my son.

483
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:11,103
He's skateboarding
with a friend.

484
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:13,481
Do you want to walk
up with me?

485
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,024
Starting now?

486
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:17,481
Yeah, starting now.

487
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:18,815
Okay.

488
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:20,651
Yeah, we got to
figure this out.
It's a big deal.

489
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,531
You lost a
Sean O'Connell.

490
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:25,034
I used to work
at Nabisco.

491
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:29,494
And then,
I had a change...

492
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,999
and I decided
to apply to <i>LIFE.</i>

493
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:35,628
Thought it would
be more colorful,
less regular, I guess.

494
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:38,335
You know, I just like
the idea of it.

495
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,167
I like the motto
of the company.

496
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:42,631
Do you know it?

497
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:43,885
"To see the world...

498
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:46,343
"Things dangerous
to come to...

499
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:47,882
"To see behind walls."

500
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,471
Yeah, I...

501
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:52,978
I got this, from Sean.

502
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:55,519
He gave this to you?

503
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:56,853
Yeah.

504
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,312
I like that,
"TO DRAW CLOSER."

505
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:05,651
So, what's he
like in person?

506
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:06,988
Sean?
Yeah.

507
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:10,655
Well, I haven't
actually met him.

508
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:12,664
I mean, we talk
a lot, but...

509
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:15,827
I've been his point guy here
ever since I started.

510
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,495
How long ago was that?

511
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,001
16 years.

512
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:21,256
16 years?

513
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:22,883
Oh, my gosh. Wow.

514
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:24,339
Well, you have
nothing to worry about.

515
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:26,004
With the layoffs,
I mean.

516
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:28,093
I've been here
for a month.

517
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:30,259
"Last in,
first out," right?

518
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,351
Oh. Sorry.

519
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,556
It's Rich's dad.

520
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,853
It's your--

521
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,895
Former.
Newly former.

522
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:44,906
But we've been sort of...
I don't know.

523
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:46,715
I don't need
to get it.

524
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:52,530
So, what kind of skateboard
does your son have?

525
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,245
Um, I have
no idea!

526
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:57,542
It's oblong.
I don't know.

527
00:29:57,713 --> 00:30:00,046
Why?
No, I just--

528
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:04,546
I used to...
I was kind of
into the scene.

529
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:06,719
The skateboard scene?
Yeah.

530
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:08,050
Wow!

531
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:10,097
Hi, Peg.

532
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:13,385
Yeah, it's Sean
O'Connell, we actually
need to find him.

533
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:18,059
Yes. If you
could hurry.

534
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:19,815
Kickflip.

535
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,309
Yeah.

536
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:23,478
It's a good one
for the repertoire.

537
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:25,946
I'm Walter.

538
00:30:26,116 --> 00:30:27,152
Rich.

539
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:29,806
Yeah, we think he
might know something
or have an asset we need.

540
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,444
You know, you just got to get
a little more snap...

541
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:33,078
get that thing up there.

542
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:35,990
Want me to show
you something?

543
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:38,242
Sure.

544
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:41,297
Here.

545
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:43,460
I like your trucks.

546
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:44,840
Thanks.

547
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,589
Now check this out.

548
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:51,339
Know about the flick?
Uh-huh.

549
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:54,931
Yeah, we've finished
processing his
April work order.

550
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:03,608
Yes, it's kind
of important.

551
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:09,407
Did you forward
the job 1090s?

552
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:11,739
Or his last salary?

553
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:14,115
Wow!

554
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,075
Wow!

555
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:20,914
Here you go.
That was awesome.

556
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,169
So it could be
either place.

557
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,913
Thanks, Walter.
Okay. Thanks, Peg.

558
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:25,091
All right.

559
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:27,629
Hey, so...

560
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:29,465
Sean's definitely
not in New York.

561
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:31,174
Peg said she
sent multiples.

562
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:33,340
I don't know if you know
how it works with him.

563
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:36,351
She sends copies
because we never know
where he's gonna be.

564
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,604
And this week she
sent 1090s to Princeton,
New Jersey.

565
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:41,768
Oh, great.
Train ride.

566
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,482
And one to Greenland.

567
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:44,652
Just in case.

568
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:47,149
Greenland, the country?

569
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:49,279
That's--

570
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:51,983
You can't take
a train there.

571
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:53,363
No.

572
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:55,369
Well, maybe
he's in Jersey.
Yeah.

573
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:58,327
Yeah, is your phone
done buffering with
that ship's name?

574
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,537
Yes! Look.
Here it is.

575
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,872
Nuuk, Greenland.

576
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,746
Yeah!

577
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:07,002
Come on, that's
a good lead!

578
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:09,007
You should
follow that up.

579
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:11,837
Yeah, follow it
up in Greenland.

580
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:14,175
Yeah. Why not? Go!

581
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:15,840
Crack the case.

582
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,553
Listen to your wallet.

583
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:23,940
Sorry, it's my--
it's Phil again.

584
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:26,642
Maybe he fell down
a well or something.
Maybe I should get it.

585
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,901
Hey, buddy! Here!

586
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:29,858
Rich, Rich! Not
so fast! Here!

587
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,192
Take that.

588
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:34,863
Yeah. I understand.

589
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,986
Okay. Bye.

590
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:39,830
He did fall
down a well.

591
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:41,908
But I don't care.

592
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:44,498
I just want to be
with you, you know?

593
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:45,754
Really?

594
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:49,211
Let's run away together.
Let's make every moment
count, starting now.

595
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:50,426
Sweet!

596
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:52,887
Can I tell you something?

597
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,007
Anything.

598
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:58,174
I have that
Benjamin Buttons thing.

599
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:01,094
Where you get old,
but smaller.

600
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:04,355
Or whatever, and become
a gradual old baby.
Or something.

601
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:07,104
I didn't see the movie,
so I don't really
know how it works.

602
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:08,518
But I have it.

603
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:11,521
We can still
build a life together.

604
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:13,115
Cool.

605
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:29,288
I like your
snappy little suit.

606
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:31,966
I bought it at
a doll store.

607
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:33,585
Oh. Cool.

608
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:38,886
My little heart
is no bigger
than a quarter...

609
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:42,469
but it's as full
as Fort Knox.

610
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:45,600
You're the bravest
man I've ever known.

611
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,440
I love you, baby.

612
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:51,227
Not like "baby," like...

613
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:55,239
because you look
like a little weird
baby-man.

614
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:57,612
I get it.

615
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:00,782
Thank you for such
a wonderful life.

616
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,953
Just nestle in here and die.

617
00:34:10,674 --> 00:34:12,791
Good-bye, Walter.

618
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:14,754
Good-bye! Walter!

619
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,796
Walter!
Walter!

620
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:19,134
Bye!
Oh!

621
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,639
Sorry! I was just--

622
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,758
Where do you go?

623
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:24,802
I started thinking about--

624
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,701
No, it's okay,
I was probably boring you
about my broken refrigerator.

625
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:28,816
No!

626
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:30,484
Rich!

627
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:32,860
My son's running
into the street.
I have to go.

628
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:34,486
Yeah.

629
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:37,865
I wanted to tell you,
that song, "Major Tom"?

630
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:40,697
Back there, when
the beard guy was--

631
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:42,974
He doesn't know what
he's talking about.

632
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:47,038
That song is about courage
and going into the unknown.

633
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:49,122
It's a cool song.

634
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:54,540
Rich!

635
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:05,686
Yo!

636
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,638
Where's my thing?

637
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:11,019
It's in a silver bath.

638
00:35:12,097 --> 00:35:14,338
I don't even know
what language you're
speaking right now.

639
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:16,149
You know, you got
to take me seriously.

640
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:18,360
I got a magazine
to execute here.

641
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,365
And bosses to answer to.

642
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:23,494
So next time I see you,
I see that picture. Okay?

643
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:26,200
Hey! Dream Machine!

644
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:27,374
Hello?

645
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,208
I want proof
you heard me.

646
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:33,712
Next time I see you--

647
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,339
You see the picture.

648
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,713
That's right!

649
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:47,218
Any luck, Hernando?

650
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:50,012
I turned
the place upside-down.
25 is not here.

651
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,601
I searched Receiving,
too, man.

652
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:55,060
This never happens!

653
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,027
I'm telling you...

654
00:35:57,197 --> 00:35:58,438
it's nowhere, Walter.

655
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:03,572
I mean, maybe he
didn't even send it.

656
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:05,786
Maybe it's still on him.

657
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:08,914
Walter?

658
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:36,775
Walter!

659
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:11,303
<i>Something filled up</i>

660
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:18,810

661

665
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:36,647
Hi.

666
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:38,065
Hi.

667
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,891
Do you have any
cars available?

668
00:38:41,945 --> 00:38:45,734
Yeah, we have a blue one
and a red one.

669
00:38:49,953 --> 00:38:51,694
I'll take the red one.

670
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:40,618
<i>You were working as</i>
<i>a waitress In a cocktail bar</i>

671
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:43,788
<i>When I met you</i>

672
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:48,175
<i>I picked you out,</i>
<i>I shook you up</i>
<i>Ånd turned you around</i>

673
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:51,508
<i>Turned you into someone new</i>

674
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:53,672
Hi.
Hi.

675
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:57,969
Can I ask you,
could someone
receive mail here?

676
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:00,263
An American?
Sean O'Connell?

677
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,148
I think he might have
received mail at
this address.

678
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:05,776
You want a drink?

679
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:08,195
Okay. Yeah, I guess...

680
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:13,112
a small beer shoe.

681
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:15,493
So, could somebody
get mail here?

682
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:16,747
Heli mail.

683
00:40:16,873 --> 00:40:17,873
"Heli mail"?

684
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:21,325
We helicopter
mail to the ships
when they pass by.

685
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:23,619
We are pub and helipad.

686
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:26,251
Yeah. Wait,
the <i>Erkigsnek?</i>

687
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:27,835
Yeah<i>. Erkigsnek.</i>

688
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:29,125
<i>Erkigsnek.</i>

689
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,672
We flew mail
to her Tuesday.

690
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:34,505
I'm gonna take it
down a little, here.

691
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,514
I just want to
speak from the heart.

692
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,513
I lost a good lady.

693
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:41,979
I feel this song is helping me
feel like I'm not alone.

694
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:45,933
Even though
I pretty much am.

695
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,277
Come on, let's sing it.

696
00:40:47,654 --> 00:40:49,020
Everyone.

697
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,441
Let's sing it together.

698
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:52,777
<i>Don't you want me, baby?</i>

699
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:54,863
Do you know who
flies the mail out?

700
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:56,948
Do you have
regular pilots?

701
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:58,038
Hey, man.

702
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,829
Just keep it going, man.

703
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,240
Hey.
Sing it.

704
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:03,784
No, no, thank you.
I'm all right.

705
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:05,419
Come on, man. Go on.

706
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:07,420
<i>I was working</i>
<i>as a waitress</i>

707
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:10,298
Yeah, I know it.
I'm okay. Thank you.

708
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,505
I'm on a business trip,
I'm working.

709
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:14,636
Come on, man.
This song is
important to me.

710
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:16,890
Yeah.
Yeah.

711
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:17,969
Sing it.
Okay.

712
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:22,853
<i>I was working as</i>
<i>a waitress in a cocktail bar</i>
<i>That much is true</i>

713
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:23,939
Okay?

714
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,851
That sucked.

715
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:26,978
Do your work.

716
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:28,068
You don't have to push.

717
00:41:29,112 --> 00:41:31,024
What if I poke you?
Don't poke me.

718
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:33,189
Do your work, man.
Don't poke me!

719
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:34,857
I'm poking you.
What am I doing?

720
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,900
Stop poking me!
Don't poke me!

721
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:41,617
Hey!

722
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:44,874
Come on!

723
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,420
Aah!

724
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:51,752
Wait, wait.
Wait!

725
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:54,261
Your thumb!
I have to talk to
you about your thumb!

726
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:02,184
Yeah. I flew mail out
to the <i>Erkigsnek</i> Tuesday.

727
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:04,770
Gave him a ride.

728
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:08,057
He took that photo
of my hand on the stick.

729
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:13,112
I'm just blown away
I located your thumb.

730
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:17,274
There is, like, eight
people in Greenland.

731
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:23,285
I mean, it's a good
place to find a thumb.

732
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:28,627
Don't cheat on
your lady, man...

733
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:31,789
when you live in a country
that only has
eight people in it.

734
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:33,707
By the way.

735
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:35,594
So, uh...

736
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:38,136
You're scrappy.

737
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:42,808
You're a little
scrappy Duncan.

738
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:45,306
So, you're trying
to find this guy?

739
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,891
Yes. Yeah.

740
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:50,896
Well, I'm flying some
radio parts out there
in five minutes.

741
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:56,146
He may still be
on the boat.

742
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:57,699
Really?
Yeah.

743
00:42:59,035 --> 00:43:01,778
Maybe you could
come with me.

744
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:13,502
Yeah, or maybe I could
just call him on
the boat phone.

745
00:43:14,509 --> 00:43:16,125
The boat phone?

746
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:18,464
Yeah, the phone
on the boat.

747
00:43:18,638 --> 00:43:21,346
You mean the
ship-to-shore?

748
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:25,009
Yeah, maybe I
could just ask him
on the ship-to-shore.

749
00:43:25,228 --> 00:43:27,345
Their radio is broke.

750
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:30,356
That's why I'm
flying out there now.

751
00:43:30,817 --> 00:43:31,817
Oh.

752
00:43:32,235 --> 00:43:34,022
You're flying
out right now?

753
00:43:34,362 --> 00:43:35,648
I'm just gonna
finish my beer.

754
00:43:35,822 --> 00:43:37,188
The weather doesn't
look so great.

755
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:38,365
It's not.

756
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,473
Looks like there's
a storm moving in.

757
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:42,869
Yeah.

758
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:44,244
A-brewin'.

759
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:45,949
Yeah.

760
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:47,205
But you're just...

761
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:49,617
you're just gonna
finish your beer...

762
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:53,003
and then fly a machine?

763
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:57,173
Yeah.

764
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,544
I'm kind of nervous
about the storm.

765
00:44:01,681 --> 00:44:04,674
I just want to get
a couple of beers down.

766
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:16,267
Okay. I'm not gonna
go with you.

767
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:19,188
Yeah.

768
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:22,399
Whatever.

769
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:28,576
See you, man.
Okay.

770
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:29,830
See you.

771
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:33,251
Okay.

772
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:02,776
Shut up!

773
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:19,961

00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:21,883

779

Glad you came.

800
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:07,628
Are you comfortable?

801
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:08,838
What?

802
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:10,460
Are you comfortable?

803
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:11,970
No!

804
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:13,721
Hold on tight.

805
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:21,183
Hey, there she is!

806
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:38,997
Where do we land?

807
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:40,998
We don't!

808
00:48:41,085 --> 00:48:42,166
What?

809
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:44,002
We don't land.

810
00:48:57,101 --> 00:48:58,842
Okay, Walter.

811
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:01,682
I was gonna drop
the radio parts
into the boat.

812
00:49:01,856 --> 00:49:04,189
You take them.
They're right next to you.

813
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,027
These?
Yeah.

814
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:12,359
Just jump in the boat.
You got them?

815
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:14,698
Just jump in the boat?
Yeah.

816
00:49:15,578 --> 00:49:17,240
Yeah, you're doing
great, Walter!

817
00:49:17,413 --> 00:49:19,780
What do you mean,
"jump into the boat"?

818
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:23,917
What would be the best way
of reaching you
to stay in touch?

819
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:26,377
I don't know. Wait!

820
00:49:26,547 --> 00:49:28,539
What do you mean
"jump into the boat"?

821
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,711
It looks far away!

822
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:32,296
Yeah, but you
got to go now!

823
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:33,631
Go, go, go!

824
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:35,424
Go!

825
00:49:37,266 --> 00:49:38,266
No!

826
00:49:40,728 --> 00:49:41,889
No, Walter!

827
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:44,725
I meant the other boat!
The little boat!

828
00:49:53,908 --> 00:49:55,149
Help!

829
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,913
Help! Help!

830
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:03,744
Try to remain calm.

831
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:06,626
The pontoon boat
is coming for you.

832
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:09,962
You have at least a minute
before you freeze!

833
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:11,049
What?

834
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:12,258
You are safe!

835
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:21,390
There's something here!

836
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:24,599
There's a fin
here, I think!

837
00:50:24,939 --> 00:50:27,647
We are traveling through
a porpoise school!

838
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:30,100
Don't fear the porpoise!

839
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:32,644
I don't think
it's a porpoise!

840
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:35,438
I'm telling you,
it's a porpoise.

841
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:37,615
Be friendly.

842
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:40,277
It will protect
you from the sharks.

843
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:41,945
Okay.

844
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,116
Come here.

845
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:48,952
Hey!

846
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:52,459
Hey.

847
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:57,006
Okay, that's a shark.

848
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:58,636
That's what I said!

849
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:00,640
Jesus!

850
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:02,424
Stop befriending it!

851
00:51:02,518 --> 00:51:03,554
Kill it!

852
00:51:03,686 --> 00:51:05,427
It's not a porpoise!

853
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:07,307
It's not a porpoise!

854
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:09,268
Poke his eyes out!

855
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:10,441
Fight it!

856
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:19,361
Oh, my God.

857
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:20,451
Oh, my God.

858
00:51:20,661 --> 00:51:21,661
That really happened?

859
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:24,696
Real face.

860
00:51:25,291 --> 00:51:27,658
Sorry for palming
your face.

861
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:29,496
Oh, my God.

862
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:40,757
A pilot boat came.

863
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:43,344
They took him
four hours ago.

864
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:44,803
Before the storm.

865
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:46,185
Took him where?

866
00:51:46,854 --> 00:51:47,970
Iceland.

867
00:51:49,733 --> 00:51:51,334
Is there any way
that we could radio him?

868
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:54,522
It's very important
that I discuss
something with him.

869
00:51:54,695 --> 00:51:57,529
You jumped into the ocean
with our radio components.

870
00:51:57,698 --> 00:51:59,030
They are lost.

871
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:00,315
Correct?

872
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:02,359
Yeah, that's correct.

873
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:12,335
You're American?

874
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:14,213
Yeah.

875
00:52:14,715 --> 00:52:16,331
Excellent!

876
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:17,715
Fonzie!

877
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:23,175
Come on, I'll find you
some dry clothing,
homeslice.

878
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:31,347
Will this work?
For your items?

879
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:32,980
Oh, yeah.
Thank you.

880
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,766
Hey, I'll take
this, buddy.

881
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:35,860
Okay.

882
00:52:35,903 --> 00:52:37,144
Hungry?
Sure.

883
00:52:37,321 --> 00:52:40,109
I got some kick-ass cake, man.

884
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:44,077
Thank you.

885
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:45,447
Looking good.

886
00:52:45,621 --> 00:52:47,578
You can keep it.

887
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,581
Hey, this is...

888
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:53,117
This is clementine cake.

889
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:55,662
This is clementine cake.
My mom makes this.

890
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,455
Yeah, Sean brought it.

891
00:52:59,635 --> 00:53:01,217
Yeah.

892
00:53:02,054 --> 00:53:03,420
Good.

893
00:53:17,486 --> 00:53:18,486
Is this Sean's?

894
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:20,899
Yeah, he wrapped
the cake in it.

895
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:22,613
This is a shoot itinerary.

896
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:25,901
It's a field itinerary
for a photo...

897
00:53:26,412 --> 00:53:28,278
Did he say anything
about where he was going?

898
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:30,447
No, he didn't say much.

899
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:34,413
He was just taking
pictures of these guys,
the Chilean deckhands.

900
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:36,794
He even gave
me some tips...

901
00:53:36,964 --> 00:53:38,580
for my Instagrams.

902
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,051
Facebook friends?

903
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:43,630
Yeah, sure.
Great.

904
00:53:43,804 --> 00:53:47,593
What is "Eyjafallajokull"?

905
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:49,052
Eyjafjallajökull.

906
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:50,226
Excuse me?

907
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:51,310
Eyjafjallajökull.

908
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:53,271
What is that?

909
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:56,681
It's in Iceland.
It's a volcano.

910
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,641
A volcano?
Yeah.

911
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:01,561
May 2nd. That's tomorrow.

912
00:54:01,724 --> 00:54:02,924
Do you think
there's any way...

913
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:05,611
that we could possibly
land in Iceland?

914
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:06,909
Yeah.

915
00:54:07,161 --> 00:54:08,161
Yeah?

916
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:10,365
We have to in the morning.

917
00:54:10,539 --> 00:54:11,539
Great.

918
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:13,330
Because you
lost the radio.

919
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,533
Right, yeah, sorry.

920
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:17,623
Sorry. But that's...

921
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:20,209
Well, I just have
to get to...

922
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:21,418
Eyjafjallajökull.

923
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:22,550
Right.

924
00:54:27,431 --> 00:54:31,220
Hey, I'll see you on
<i>Sesame Street,</i> man.

925
00:54:55,209 --> 00:54:57,542
Okay, you're here,
and this is
Eyjafjallajökull.

926
00:54:57,711 --> 00:54:59,168
It's 15 kilometers.

927
00:54:59,338 --> 00:55:00,939
Okay.
You can take
the shore bike.

928
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:02,834
But you better
get going, man.

929
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:05,263
Yeah, he didn't write a time
on that clue paper.

930
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:08,549
No, man. Hurry.
Because of...

931
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:13,011
What? I don't understand.

932
00:55:13,191 --> 00:55:14,871
What he means, man,
is you have to hurry...

933
00:55:14,895 --> 00:55:16,615
because there's a bunch
of horny Chileans...

934
00:55:16,897 --> 00:55:19,059
who want to go
to the strip club.

935
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:20,474
There's only one bike.

936
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:29,399
Hurry, Walter,
hurry! Run! Go!

937
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:30,776
Go!

938
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:35,075
Stay gold, Pony Boy!

939
00:56:40,314 --> 00:56:41,314
Hello?

940
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:43,105
<i>Hey, what's up?</i>

941
00:56:43,442 --> 00:56:45,604
Todd? From eHarmony?

942
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:48,235
<i>Yeah! What's up, man?</i>

943
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:50,738
Not much. How
have you been?

944
00:56:50,908 --> 00:56:53,446
<i>Good. It's early here.</i>
<i>I just got up, man.</i>

945
00:56:53,619 --> 00:56:54,951
<i>I was thinking about you.</i>

946
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,281
Where are you?

947
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:57,574
<i>Los Angeles.</i>

948
00:56:57,748 --> 00:57:01,662
<i>Hey, so your profile</i>
<i>still hasn't</i>
<i>received any winks.</i>

949
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:03,636
<i>Even though I put</i>
<i>that you've been to Phoenix.</i>

950
00:57:04,338 --> 00:57:05,338
Oh!

951
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:08,916
I jumped out of
a helicopter yesterday
into the ocean.

952
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:10,958
And had a shark fight.

953
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:13,674
<i>Yeah, listen,</i>
<i>I was mentioning before...</i>

954
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:16,089
<i>people who daydream too much,</i>
<i>they're not--</i>

955
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:18,804
No, it was real.
I really did.

956
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:21,014
<i>Really?</i>
<i>Then I'll put down</i>
<i>"adrenaline junkie."</i>

957
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:22,188
<i>What kind of a shark?</i>

958
00:57:22,356 --> 00:57:23,356
Hey, Todd.

959
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:25,101
I can't really
talk right now.

960
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:26,308
I'm on my way
to a volcano.

961
00:57:26,485 --> 00:57:27,485
<i>What the--?</i>

962
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:33,217
Hey.

963
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,593
Hi. Hey.

964
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:37,754
Do you guys

965
00:58:39,725 --> 00:58:41,887
I'm looking
for Eldgos Street.

966
00:58:41,977 --> 00:58:42,977
Eldgos?

967
00:58:44,563 --> 00:58:45,599
Is that a street?

968
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:47,726
Is this Eyjafjallakuta?

969
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:50,067
Something like that?

970
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:58,115
I don't think this g y k ows what eldgos is
un.

971
00:59:00,287 --> 00:59:01,448
It's a longboard.

972
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,080
Yeah.

973
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:05,114
What is that?
Is that Thor, or...

974
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:06,870
Odin?

975
00:59:07,044 --> 00:59:09,787
A Norse god?
He's cool.

976
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:13,297
Hey.

977
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:17,718
Would you maybe
want to make a trade?

978
00:59:17,888 --> 00:59:19,470
I know a kid who
would love that board.

979
00:59:22,726 --> 00:59:23,967
It's cool. Look,
he stretches.

Yeah. He's fun.

982
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:33,727
Yeah, it's lots
of stretching fun.

983

Okay, yeah.

994
01:00:38,426 --> 01:00:39,507
I'm trying
to find this guy.

995

This man, Sean O'Connell.

996
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:43,880
I think that he possibly
might have stayed here.

997
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:46,924
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got a plane for him.

998
01:00:47,102 --> 01:00:48,764
At 1:00.

999
01:00:48,937 --> 01:00:49,973
Fifteen minutes.

1000
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:52,396
He's at airfield
in Stykkishólmur.

1001
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:54,353
In the valley.
Next town south.

Where is it?
Stykkishólmur.

"Tickishoumer"?
Yeah.

1004

No, no!

1005
01:00:58,738 --> 01:00:59,899
Is it straight
down that way?

1006
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:03,027
Thank you!

1007

1042
01:06:26,357 --> 01:06:27,893

I went to
Greenland and then...

1048
01:06:37,577 --> 01:06:42,413
I got on a fishing

<i>You're in Iceland.</i>

<i>What did you find?</i>

01:06:49,881 --> 01:06:52,419
There's a date

1054
01:06:52,592 --> 01:06:54,800
And some words
on a cake wrapper.

1055
01:06:54,969 --> 01:06:57,586
"Rajqawee," "Buzkashi"...

1056
01:06:57,764 --> 01:06:58,925
<i>and "Warlocks."</i>

1057
01:06:59,098 --> 01:07:00,930

a Papa John's

<i>Yeah. I just had to...</i>
<i>I just left.</i>

01:07:04,395 --> 01:07:05,761
Did you get kicked out?

1060
01:07:05,939 --> 01:07:07,271
No, I just needed to leave.

1061
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,102
Just the atmosphere.

1062
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:12,393
And the cups.

1063
01:07:13,154 --> 01:07:15,612
Hey, I was right
on Sean's trail.

1064

Thanks.

1067
01:07:22,121 --> 01:07:25,285
No. "Rajqawee" means
"strong little man"...

1068
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:27,745
in, like,
40 Arabic countries.

1069
01:07:27,919 --> 01:07:30,832
And "Buzkashi" is
"goat hockey"...

1070
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:32,792
in Central Asia.

1071
01:07:32,966 --> 01:07:35,959
<i>And "warlocks"...</i>

1072
01:07:36,594 --> 01:07:37,630
Yeah.

1073
01:07:38,429 --> 01:07:40,466
I was hoping
they would connect.

1074
01:07:43,601 --> 01:07:46,935
So, you said that
you left Papa John's
because of the cups?

1075
01:07:47,105 --> 01:07:49,643
Is there something
I should be aware of
as a customer?

1076
01:07:50,149 --> 01:07:53,313
No, I just worked there,
that's all.

1077
01:07:54,696 --> 01:07:56,983
I used to have a mohawk...

1078
01:07:57,490 --> 01:07:59,197
<i>and a backpack...</i>

1079
01:07:59,993 --> 01:08:04,488
<i>and this idea of</i>
<i>who I wanted to be</i>
<i>and what I wanted to do.</i>

1080
01:08:06,791 --> 01:08:08,032
<i>Yeah?</i>

1081
01:08:08,209 --> 01:08:10,166
Nothing. Just...

1082
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:14,663
<i>I was pretty</i>
<i>close with my dad.</i>

1083
01:08:14,841 --> 01:08:19,677
And he died when I
was 17, on a Tuesday.

1084
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:21,803
And we didn't
have any savings.

1085
01:08:22,348 --> 01:08:25,716
So I got a haircut
that Thursday...

1086
01:08:25,893 --> 01:08:29,307
and a job the same Thursday.

1087
01:08:30,732 --> 01:08:32,018
Papa John's?

1088
01:08:32,859 --> 01:08:34,020
<i>Yeah.</i>

1089
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:38,771
Your dad let
you have a mohawk?

1090
01:08:39,532 --> 01:08:41,774
He shaved my head.

1091
01:08:42,452 --> 01:08:44,535
That's a good dad move.

1092
01:08:45,371 --> 01:08:46,737
Yeah.

1093
01:08:48,583 --> 01:08:49,915

1094
01:08:50,627 --> 01:08:53,040
Yeah, it is.

1095
01:08:53,713 --> 01:08:55,454
It's really beautiful.

1096
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:57,255
Well, it's pretty
sucky here.

1097
01:08:57,375 --> 01:08:58,736
Human Resources
has already started

1098
01:08:58,760 --> 01:08:59,967
letting some of
the staff go...

1099
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:02,423
so it'll be a lot different
when you get back.

1100
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:05,548
Hey, I picked
something up for...

1101
01:09:07,935 --> 01:09:09,267
I think I lost you.

1102
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:13,438
You know what?
I'll catch you
up when I see you.

1103
01:09:14,233 --> 01:09:15,314
Great. Okay.

1104
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:17,568

1108
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:07,192

two floors.

1109
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:10,113

01:10:18,131 --> 01:10:19,542
I see you.

1114
01:10:19,799 --> 01:10:21,540
The photograph.
Now. Let me see it.

1115
01:10:21,718 --> 01:10:24,176
He looked it up.
There's no such
thing as a silver bath.

1116
01:10:24,804 --> 01:10:27,638
Listen, there was uncertainty
about the negative.

1117
01:10:27,807 --> 01:10:29,648
I understood that,
hopefully, it was
in Iceland.

1118
01:10:29,809 --> 01:10:30,970
It was in your care.

1119

You're fired.

1121
01:10:33,312 --> 01:10:34,644

Put it on a plaque.
Hang it at your next job.

1126
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:50,486
Now I got to
explain this
to the board?

1127
01:10:52,999 --> 01:10:54,331
Hey.

1128
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:57,121
Are you okay?

1129
01:10:57,211 --> 01:10:58,668
Yeah.

1130
01:10:59,338 --> 01:11:00,829
That's cool.

1131
01:11:01,007 --> 01:11:04,341
It's a skateboard.
It's for Cheryl's son.

1132
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:07,962
Cheryl's not in.
She was let go.

1133
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:10,547
I told you,
man, it's bad.

1134
01:11:10,725 --> 01:11:12,136
Hey! That's my fern.

1135
01:11:13,352 --> 01:11:14,843
Thank you.

1136
01:12:05,947 --> 01:12:06,947
Hi.

1137
01:12:07,615 --> 01:12:08,731
Hi.

1138
01:12:11,285 --> 01:12:12,617
Can I...?

1139
01:12:14,664 --> 01:12:16,030
Yeah.

1140
01:12:16,791 --> 01:12:19,249
I'm looking for
Cheryl Melhoff.

1141
01:12:19,877 --> 01:12:20,877
You want Cheryl?

1142
01:12:21,546 --> 01:12:23,833
Yeah. She's...

1143
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:29,802
We work together,
and she was helping
me with a work thing.

1144
01:12:32,139 --> 01:12:33,630
Cheryl.

1145
01:12:35,643 --> 01:12:37,054
Honey?

1146
01:12:38,896 --> 01:12:40,353
There's some guy here.

1147
01:12:40,523 --> 01:12:42,139
What?

1148
01:12:44,151 --> 01:12:45,267
From work.

1149
01:12:45,903 --> 01:12:48,316
Okay, hold on.
I'm on the phone.

1150
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:14,466
<i>It's Conan.</i>

1151
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:19,476
<i>Tonight,</i>
<i>First Lady Michelle Obama,</i>
<i>Walter Mitty.</i>

1152
01:13:19,645 --> 01:13:21,477
<i>Can we talk</i>
<i>about your love life?</i>

1153
01:13:21,814 --> 01:13:23,180
<i>I think people</i>
<i>would be interested.</i>

1154
01:13:23,357 --> 01:13:24,997
<i>You don't want to know</i>
<i>about my love life.</i>

1155
01:13:25,318 --> 01:13:26,479
<i>I think they do.</i>

1156
01:13:26,736 --> 01:13:30,355
<i>Yeah, I think they do.</i>
<i>Now, I don't believe</i>
<i>everything I read.</i>

1157
01:13:30,531 --> 01:13:33,239
<i>There's a scandal?</i>
<i>A little scandal?</i>

1158
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:35,401
<i>A little scandal, yes.</i>

1159
01:13:35,578 --> 01:13:39,162
<i>She was back with her</i>
<i>husband, or something.</i>

1160
01:13:39,332 --> 01:13:40,332
<i>Then she fell for you?</i>

1161
01:13:40,374 --> 01:13:42,491
<i>Where there's smoke,</i>
<i>there's fire.</i>

1162
01:13:42,668 --> 01:13:43,829
<i>You're awesome, Walter.</i>

1163
01:13:44,003 --> 01:13:45,003
<i>Thanks.</i>

1164
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:46,168
<i>Sure.</i>

1165
01:13:46,547 --> 01:13:48,038
Can you turn this off?

1166
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:50,127
It stays on.

1167
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:55,671
I'm just going to get out.

1168
01:14:10,112 --> 01:14:11,148
Hey, Mom.

1169
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:12,280
Hi, honey.

1170
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:15,194
Walter, you got
to tip these guys.

1171
01:14:15,368 --> 01:14:17,360
We got the piano
back safe, Mom.

1172
01:14:18,371 --> 01:14:20,408
Are you back
from your work trip?

1173
01:14:20,581 --> 01:14:22,117
Yeah, this morning.

1174
01:14:22,375 --> 01:14:23,536
Hungry?

1175
01:14:24,001 --> 01:14:25,001
Mmm-hmm.

1176
01:14:25,544 --> 01:14:27,035
I'm making soup.
Thanks.

1177
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:28,795
Hey, tipping time now.

1178
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:36,256
This is all I got.

1179
01:14:38,849 --> 01:14:40,306
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

1180
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:42,308
All right,
thanks, everybody.

1181
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:43,810
For all your
hard work.

1182
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:45,141
We appreciate
it, ma'am.

1183
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:47,021
You did great.
You just let
yourself out.

1184
01:14:47,191 --> 01:14:48,648
He's good for this.

1185
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:52,689
Are you gonna
stay for dinner?

1186
01:14:52,863 --> 01:14:53,984
Oh, Mom,
I'd love to.

1187
01:14:54,156 --> 01:14:55,647
I think I'm just
really wiped out

1188
01:14:55,783 --> 01:14:57,240
after supervising
moving that thing
all day.

1189
01:14:57,410 --> 01:15:00,278
I think I just
need to go to yoga
and then just crash.

1190
01:15:00,454 --> 01:15:01,945
What is it?
A class?

1191
01:15:02,373 --> 01:15:03,373
Yes, yoga.

1192
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:06,284
It's a class.
I go to the hot kind,
where they heat the room.

1193
01:15:07,086 --> 01:15:08,543
Have you heard
of that?
Sure.

1194
01:15:08,713 --> 01:15:10,670
You have?
It's great for you.

1195
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:12,360
You just get it all
out of your system.

1196
01:15:12,466 --> 01:15:14,958
You get your sweat out,
you just get everything,
all your fear.

1197
01:15:15,136 --> 01:15:17,219
I'm waiting on
a call about
an audition.

1198
01:15:17,388 --> 01:15:18,629
That <i>Grease</i> show?

1199
01:15:18,806 --> 01:15:20,092
Yeah.
Rizzo?

1200
01:15:20,266 --> 01:15:22,303
Yeah. I'm really
excited about it.

1201
01:15:23,216 --> 01:15:25,497
What's good about
this is that I just
don't worry about it.

1202
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:26,762
I just get
out of my head.

1203
01:15:26,939 --> 01:15:27,939
Is that good for you?

1204
01:15:28,024 --> 01:15:30,232
I feel like it's good
in a class like this.

1205
01:15:30,401 --> 01:15:31,983
I mean, I'm not
going to get paid
for it, which is fine.

1206
01:15:32,153 --> 01:15:33,689
It's not about money.
Wonderful.

1207
01:15:33,863 --> 01:15:35,445
And I feel like...

1208
01:15:35,614 --> 01:15:39,574
It's just for kids,
but I think it's important
for them to start early.

1209
01:15:40,077 --> 01:15:41,318
I'm really
thrilled, Mom.

1210
01:15:41,495 --> 01:15:43,452
I think I'm just
going to enjoy it.

1211
01:15:43,581 --> 01:15:45,447
Just standing in front
of people and talking.

1212
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:47,870
You'll be good at that.
Yeah.

1213
01:15:48,044 --> 01:15:50,044
You'll really
be good at that.
I think so, too, Mom.

1214
01:15:50,087 --> 01:15:51,373
Hey, Mom?

1215
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:52,708
Yeah.

1216
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:57,755
Did somebody take
a picture of your piano,
like, a week ago?

1217
01:16:00,097 --> 01:16:01,338
I did.

1218
01:16:02,141 --> 01:16:03,973
With Sean's camera.

1219
01:16:08,105 --> 01:16:09,312
Sean O'Connell's camera?

1220
01:16:09,482 --> 01:16:11,314
Yeah, he came to visit.

1221
01:16:12,443 --> 01:16:13,809
Mom, what?

1222
01:16:14,904 --> 01:16:15,904
Yeah.

1223
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:17,854
He wanted to know
about your work schedule,

1224
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:19,947
when you left,
when you came home.

1225
01:16:20,117 --> 01:16:22,484
He said you
really understood <i>LIFE.</i>

1226
01:16:22,661 --> 01:16:24,402
He was really
interested in your work.

1227
01:16:26,665 --> 01:16:28,122
Mom, why didn't you tell me?

1228
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:30,826
I told you.
I told you in
the produce aisle.

1229
01:16:31,003 --> 01:16:32,539
I remember that.

1230
01:16:34,173 --> 01:16:35,209
Maybe you were...

1231
01:16:35,382 --> 01:16:39,092
Odessa, what is it you call
it when he goes into one
of his little places?

1232
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:40,877
"Zoned out."

1233
01:16:41,055 --> 01:16:42,967
You do that
now and then.

1234
01:16:44,809 --> 01:16:46,516
What's the matter?

1235
01:16:47,978 --> 01:16:49,765
I got fired.

1236
01:16:50,314 --> 01:16:52,021
I lost a picture of his.

1237
01:16:52,817 --> 01:16:53,817
Can you find it?

1238
01:16:55,027 --> 01:16:57,144
No, I don't know
where he is.

1239
01:16:57,321 --> 01:17:00,405
He's someplace
with warlocks or...

1240
01:17:01,325 --> 01:17:02,941
Warlords.

1241
01:17:03,202 --> 01:17:04,659
No, warlocks.

1242
01:17:05,079 --> 01:17:06,661
No. Warlords.

1243
01:17:06,831 --> 01:17:10,165
Sean said he had to meet
with warlords very soon...

1244
01:17:10,334 --> 01:17:12,326
and maybe he
would take my cake

1245
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:14,453
so that he could
get permission...

1246
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:17,043
to trek through
the wilds and places.

1247
01:17:17,216 --> 01:17:20,050
He said he wants to photograph
snow leopards. How about that?

1248
01:17:20,219 --> 01:17:21,630
Who?

1249
01:17:31,021 --> 01:17:33,638
"Ungoverned Afghanistan."

1250
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:37,646
Mmm-hmm.

1251
01:17:37,736 --> 01:17:38,736
That's where Sean is.

1252
01:17:39,446 --> 01:17:41,938
Crazy Afghanistan. Yeah.

1253
01:17:42,616 --> 01:17:44,699
In the upper Himalayas.

1254
01:17:45,619 --> 01:17:47,360
They can't
let you go.

1255
01:17:48,372 --> 01:17:50,455
You were Sean's partner.

1256
01:17:50,624 --> 01:17:51,785
He told me...

1257
01:17:51,959 --> 01:17:54,417
that you were the person
who worked the hardest...

1258
01:17:54,587 --> 01:17:59,048
to make sure his
work was realized
the way he wished.

1259
01:18:04,263 --> 01:18:05,970
You finish his work.

1260
01:18:49,850 --> 01:18:52,058
<i>Heaven is a switchboard</i>
<i>that you want to fight</i>

1261

01:19:03,614 --> 01:19:05,276

01:19:05,366 --> 01:19:07,449

01:22:00,499 --> 01:22:01,660
Okay.

1282
01:22:01,834 --> 01:22:03,166
<i>But something else.</i>

1283
01:22:03,335 --> 01:22:05,167
<i>Cheryl Melhoff...</i>

1284
01:22:05,337 --> 01:22:07,875
<i>she's not on here</i>
<i>anymore. Withdrawn.</i>

1285
01:22:08,382 --> 01:22:09,382
Oh.

1286
01:22:09,550 --> 01:22:11,291
Really?
<i>Yeah.</i>

1287
01:22:11,844 --> 01:22:13,301
<i>Hey, man, where</i>
<i>are you now?</i>

1288
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:14,677
Himalayas.

1289
01:22:14,847 --> 01:22:18,011
<i>The Himalayas.</i>
<i>I love it.</i>

1290
01:22:18,183 --> 01:22:19,674
<i>That is a kick-ass</i>
<i>"Been There."</i>

1291
01:22:19,852 --> 01:22:21,844
Todd, I'm gonna
keep this short.

1292
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:23,682
I have to make
oxygen choices.

1293
01:22:23,856 --> 01:22:26,064
<i>Hey, I get it. Go!</i>

1294
01:22:26,233 --> 01:22:29,397
<i>Anyway,</i>
<i>you have a profile now.</i>
<i>Congratulations.</i>

1295
01:22:29,570 --> 01:22:31,357
Cool, but,
you know what?

1296
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:33,066
Would you take me off?

1297
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:36,233
I can't really
swing that $500 yearly.

1298
01:22:36,410 --> 01:22:37,651
Hey.

1299
01:22:40,205 --> 01:22:41,286
Hey, man.

1300
01:22:41,373 --> 01:22:42,614
<i>You're sure?</i>
<i>Because I feel like</i>

1301
01:22:42,749 --> 01:22:44,029
<i>we're really</i>
<i>onto something here.</i>

1302
01:22:44,168 --> 01:22:47,036
Do you mind?
I'm working.

1303
01:22:47,212 --> 01:22:49,204
<i>This is one of</i>
<i>the best profiles</i>
<i>I've ever done.</i>

1304
01:22:49,381 --> 01:22:51,301
<i>And our refund policy,</i>
<i>well, we don't have one...</i>

1305
01:22:51,341 --> 01:22:53,173
Todd, I got to go.

1306
01:22:55,095 --> 01:22:56,095
Sean.

1307
01:22:57,014 --> 01:22:58,095
Yeah.

1308
01:23:04,855 --> 01:23:06,892
It's Walter.

1309
01:23:10,527 --> 01:23:12,234
Mitty.

1310
01:23:21,246 --> 01:23:22,246
Walter Mitty.

1311
01:23:23,123 --> 01:23:24,739
Seriously?

1312
01:23:26,877 --> 01:23:29,085
How the hell did
you get up here?

1313
01:23:29,922 --> 01:23:31,413
I just...

1314
01:23:35,093 --> 01:23:36,800
I've been looking for you.

1315
01:23:39,806 --> 01:23:41,388
Sit down.

1316
01:23:48,232 --> 01:23:49,598
I'll sit.

1317
01:23:57,616 --> 01:23:59,448
Well, take your time.
Settle in.

1318
01:23:59,618 --> 01:24:01,450
Try to be
real still, okay?

1319
01:24:03,914 --> 01:24:05,496
There's a snow leopard.

1320
01:24:06,625 --> 01:24:09,163
Right in this ridge.

1321
01:24:10,003 --> 01:24:13,667
So we have to try
to be very, very,
very, very still.

1322
01:24:16,802 --> 01:24:19,294
They call the snow
leopard the "ghost cat."

1323
01:24:21,306 --> 01:24:23,593
It never lets
itself be seen.

1324
01:24:28,355 --> 01:24:30,347
Ghost cat?

1325
01:24:33,610 --> 01:24:37,149
Beautiful things
don't ask for attention.

1326
01:24:42,703 --> 01:24:47,949
Sean, there was
a negative that got
separated from your roll.

1327
01:24:50,043 --> 01:24:53,002
I'm taking a lot
of heat over it
at work.

1328
01:24:53,171 --> 01:24:57,006
It never came
with the roll
that you sent.

1329
01:24:57,175 --> 01:24:59,007
The last roll
you're talking about?

1330
01:24:59,177 --> 01:25:00,293
Yeah.

1331
01:25:00,429 --> 01:25:01,510
The 25.

1332
01:25:02,973 --> 01:25:04,635
Yeah.

1333
01:25:05,851 --> 01:25:07,808
You're sitting on it.

1334
01:25:10,856 --> 01:25:12,722
Why am I sitting on it?

1335
01:25:14,151 --> 01:25:16,017
It's in your wallet.

1336
01:25:16,862 --> 01:25:18,899
That was the gift.

1337
01:25:19,072 --> 01:25:20,813
The photograph.

1338
01:25:20,991 --> 01:25:22,857
The wallet was just
something I could
put it in.

1339
01:25:23,035 --> 01:25:26,494
So, I put it in
a little slot, the little
picture holder in there.

1340
01:25:26,663 --> 01:25:28,325
I thought it
would be cute.

1341
01:25:30,917 --> 01:25:32,749
I told you,
"look inside."

1342
01:25:33,420 --> 01:25:35,036
In the note.

1343
01:25:35,339 --> 01:25:36,500
You said "look inside."

1344
01:25:36,673 --> 01:25:39,882
I thought you meant
look inside of
the wrapping paper.

1345
01:25:40,427 --> 01:25:43,044
Yeah? Well, you
got a real nice
surprise coming.

1346
01:25:43,221 --> 01:25:45,383
No, I don't have it.

1347
01:25:45,557 --> 01:25:47,469
I don't have
it anymore.

1348
01:25:47,559 --> 01:25:48,559
Whoa!

1349
01:25:54,441 --> 01:25:56,398
What the hell
were you thinking?

1350
01:25:58,695 --> 01:26:01,608
I mean, I'm sorry,
I've admired you for
a very long time...

1351
01:26:01,782 --> 01:26:05,446
but that is not
a good move, at all,
with a valuable negative.

1352
01:26:05,619 --> 01:26:07,576
Sorry, I just...

1353
01:26:07,746 --> 01:26:10,284
I thought it would be
a playful kind of thing.

1354
01:26:10,457 --> 01:26:11,914
Playful?

1355
01:26:13,126 --> 01:26:14,708
Too playful.

1356
01:26:16,088 --> 01:26:17,420
I see what you're saying.

1357
01:26:17,589 --> 01:26:20,252
With the cover,
I should have been
more straightforward.

1358
01:26:20,425 --> 01:26:23,463
But can I ask you,
I mean, if you
don't mind...

1359
01:26:24,429 --> 01:26:26,216
what did you do
with the wallet?

1360
01:26:27,265 --> 01:26:28,722
Chucked it.

1361
01:26:31,061 --> 01:26:33,178
Well, that hurts
my feelings.

1362
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:36,431
No. Man, I liked
it very much.

1363
01:26:36,608 --> 01:26:37,940
I appreciated
it very much.

1364
01:26:38,110 --> 01:26:39,110
So you threw it away?

1365
01:26:43,448 --> 01:26:46,361
So, you have no
idea what it was?

1366
01:26:47,452 --> 01:26:48,452
The photograph?

1367
01:26:52,290 --> 01:26:53,622
It's a shame.

1368
01:26:56,128 --> 01:26:57,960
It was a beauty.

1369
01:27:14,563 --> 01:27:16,930
How did you
find me, anyway?

1370
01:27:19,484 --> 01:27:20,725
My mom.

1371
01:27:21,611 --> 01:27:24,820
Cool lady. Knows
how to bake.

1372
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:26,731
Yeah.

1373
01:27:29,411 --> 01:27:30,652
Hey, why did you--
Shh!

1374
01:28:06,907 --> 01:28:09,445
When are you gonna take it?

1375
01:28:13,538 --> 01:28:15,450
Sometimes I don't.

1376
01:28:16,333 --> 01:28:18,120
If I like a moment...

1377
01:28:18,752 --> 01:28:22,416
I mean, me, personally...

1378
01:28:24,382 --> 01:28:27,546
I don't like to
have the distraction
of the camera.

1379
01:28:31,056 --> 01:28:34,891
Just want to stay in it.

1380
01:28:38,396 --> 01:28:40,058
Stay in it?

1381
01:28:41,566 --> 01:28:43,228
Yeah, right there.

1382
01:28:44,402 --> 01:28:46,234
Right here.

1383
01:28:49,574 --> 01:28:51,406
Now it's gone.
It's gone.

1384
01:28:57,999 --> 01:28:59,456
That looks like fun.

1385
01:28:59,793 --> 01:29:01,750
I think I'm
gonna jump in.

1386
01:29:02,879 --> 01:29:05,246
Hey, what was
the picture, Sean?

1387
01:29:06,132 --> 01:29:09,250
We're gonna be odd-numbered
if you don't join.

1388
01:29:10,595 --> 01:29:12,882
What was the picture?

1389
01:29:13,932 --> 01:29:17,642
Let's just call
it a ghost cat,
Walter Mitty.

1390
01:29:25,193 --> 01:29:27,480
<i>What's in your hand</i>

1391
01:29:28,613 --> 01:29:31,822
<i>You're pinned down to routines</i>

1392
01:29:35,453 --> 01:29:38,036
<i>Elevate and leave</i>

1393
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:41,203
<i>The flickering screen</i>

1394
01:29:45,422 --> 01:29:48,631
<i>Where nothing is compromised</i>

1395
01:29:49,509 --> 01:29:51,751
<i>Nothing is lost</i>

1396
01:29:55,765 --> 01:29:58,849
<i>When everything is realized</i>

1397
01:30:00,103 --> 01:30:02,186
<i>Nothing is crossed</i>

1398
01:31:04,793 --> 01:31:06,534
You made
the watch list.

1399
01:31:06,711 --> 01:31:09,419
How did you get
to Afghanistan?
There's a travel ban.

1400
01:31:10,632 --> 01:31:12,168
Through Yemen.

1401
01:31:13,426 --> 01:31:15,338
Violent place.

1402
01:31:16,304 --> 01:31:18,591
That's why the air
fare is only $84.

1403
01:31:19,683 --> 01:31:21,595
Can I have
my fife back?

1404
01:31:23,645 --> 01:31:25,477
Do you know anyone
in Los Angeles?

1405
01:31:25,647 --> 01:31:27,809
No.
Any acquaintances? Okay.

1406
01:31:27,983 --> 01:31:28,983
Any companions?

1407
01:31:29,150 --> 01:31:32,393
Anybody here who
might be able to verify
that you're Walter Mitty?

1408
01:31:42,580 --> 01:31:44,162
Walter Mitty?

1409
01:31:44,374 --> 01:31:45,374
Yeah.

1410
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:48,618
Todd Mahar.
eHarmony.

1411
01:31:49,629 --> 01:31:50,629
Hey.

1412
01:31:52,257 --> 01:31:53,257
Thank you.
Thanks.

1413
01:31:53,425 --> 01:31:54,961
What? Come here.

1414
01:31:55,135 --> 01:31:56,671
Come here.

1415
01:31:56,845 --> 01:31:58,256
Backpack.

1416
01:31:58,430 --> 01:31:59,762
Big hug!

1417
01:32:00,015 --> 01:32:02,098
Airport prison, huh?

1418
01:32:02,183 --> 01:32:03,183
Yeah.

1419
01:32:03,309 --> 01:32:05,847
Tell me all about
it over a Cinnabon.
Come on.

1420
01:32:06,021 --> 01:32:07,603
Cinnabon!

1421
01:32:09,649 --> 01:32:11,732
How long were
you detained for,
by the way?

1422
01:32:13,111 --> 01:32:14,773
Like, 17 hours.

1423
01:32:15,155 --> 01:32:17,442
Wow! How's that
Cinnabon taste?

1424
01:32:17,615 --> 01:32:18,615
Really great.

1425
01:32:18,825 --> 01:32:21,613
That's frosted heroin.
That's what you're
eating, my friend.

1426
01:32:21,786 --> 01:32:24,494
That's what you're having
right there, man.

1427
01:32:24,581 --> 01:32:25,581
By the way...

1428
01:32:25,623 --> 01:32:29,412
you got 300 winks
before I took
down your profile.

1429
01:32:29,586 --> 01:32:32,169
In the space
of two hours.
It was crazy.

1430
01:32:32,338 --> 01:32:33,899
I thought I was selling
concert tickets.

1431
01:32:34,758 --> 01:32:35,999
I never checked.

1432
01:32:36,134 --> 01:32:37,966
Oh! Because of...

1433
01:32:38,845 --> 01:32:41,553
the "Piña Colada"
girl that quit?

1434
01:32:42,390 --> 01:32:43,926
Yeah.
Yeah.

1435
01:32:44,017 --> 01:32:45,017
Cheryl.

1436
01:32:46,436 --> 01:32:50,646
Cheryl, who did not respond
to a single wink...

1437
01:32:50,815 --> 01:32:52,147
the whole time
she was on there.

1438
01:32:52,567 --> 01:32:54,058
That's a choosy lady.

1439
01:32:54,486 --> 01:32:57,445
<i>That's a choosy lady.</i>

1440
01:32:58,907 --> 01:32:59,988
How's the...

1441
01:33:01,618 --> 01:33:03,575
daydreaming going?

1442
01:33:06,498 --> 01:33:07,830
Lately, less.

1443
01:33:09,667 --> 01:33:10,828
Good.

1444
01:33:11,002 --> 01:33:12,163
Less is good.

1445
01:33:12,962 --> 01:33:14,248
Thanks for the pastry.

1446
01:33:14,422 --> 01:33:16,505
Yeah, well,
you owe me.

1447
01:33:16,674 --> 01:33:19,041
I'll send you a check
as soon as I sell the piano.

1448
01:33:20,678 --> 01:33:22,385
You have a lot
on your plate.

1449
01:33:23,139 --> 01:33:25,051
What are you
gonna do now?

1450
01:33:26,184 --> 01:33:27,971
Go out and
get another job.

1451
01:33:32,190 --> 01:33:33,190
Boom!

1452
01:33:35,527 --> 01:33:37,018
Sorry, Walter,
I just...

1453
01:33:37,195 --> 01:33:38,195
What?

1454
01:33:38,238 --> 01:33:40,025
You are so not
how I pictured you.

1455
01:33:41,157 --> 01:33:42,648
How did you picture me?

1456
01:33:42,826 --> 01:33:45,284
I pictured you
as a little gray
piece of paper.

1457
01:33:45,954 --> 01:33:47,365
But now I see you...

1458
01:33:47,539 --> 01:33:49,622
and it's like
Indiana Jones...

1459
01:33:49,791 --> 01:33:51,077
decided to become
the lead singer

1460
01:33:51,209 --> 01:33:52,689
of The Strokes or
something like that.

1461
01:33:52,710 --> 01:33:54,497
It's nuts. I know.

1462
01:34:14,983 --> 01:34:16,315
Sorry, Mom.

1463
01:34:16,484 --> 01:34:17,645
What for?

1464
01:34:18,736 --> 01:34:20,819
Dad bought it for you.
It was my responsibility.

1465
01:34:21,573 --> 01:34:22,734
Oh, Walter.

1466
01:34:23,283 --> 01:34:24,319
We're all grown here.

1467
01:34:24,409 --> 01:34:26,275
We're all good.

1468
01:34:48,308 --> 01:34:49,344
Ooh!

1469
01:34:49,434 --> 01:34:51,767
That's heavy
duty, that sum.

1470
01:34:51,936 --> 01:34:53,768
You should put
this in your wallet.

1471
01:34:53,938 --> 01:34:55,645
I don't have one.
Oh.

1472
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:06,236
I found it
in the trash.

1473
01:35:06,409 --> 01:35:09,072
I always save
your knick-knacks.

1474
01:35:14,792 --> 01:35:16,124
Thanks.

1475
01:35:19,088 --> 01:35:20,204
Got it, Mom?
Got it.

1476
01:35:20,381 --> 01:35:21,747
Watch the stairs.

1477
01:36:06,344 --> 01:36:07,835
I think this works.

1478
01:36:08,012 --> 01:36:10,720
Heart of America.
Different generations.
This says it all.

1479
01:36:12,183 --> 01:36:13,299
Oh, hey. Welcome.

1480
01:36:13,476 --> 01:36:15,513
Wait, I'm sorry,
not welcome.

1481
01:36:15,687 --> 01:36:17,553
Not an employee.

1482
01:36:18,147 --> 01:36:19,558
Sorry.

1483
01:36:23,736 --> 01:36:26,524
There's the picture
Sean wanted. 25.

1484
01:36:30,034 --> 01:36:32,697
You have two days
to print for cover.

1485
01:36:35,206 --> 01:36:37,368
There's your quintessence.

1486
01:36:41,379 --> 01:36:42,415
Hey.

1487
01:36:44,382 --> 01:36:46,214
Do you know our motto?

1488
01:36:49,095 --> 01:36:50,677
"Life...

1489
01:36:52,181 --> 01:36:55,049
"I'm lovin' it?"

1490
01:36:55,601 --> 01:36:56,717
No.

1491
01:36:57,061 --> 01:36:59,053
That's McDonald's.

1492
01:37:01,774 --> 01:37:03,891
This thing that
you do, Ted...

1493
01:37:04,068 --> 01:37:06,526
where you come into a place
and you push people out.

1494
01:37:08,761 --> 01:37:10,801
You should know that those
people worked really hard

1495
01:37:10,825 --> 01:37:12,691
to build this magazine.

1496
01:37:14,954 --> 01:37:16,695
They believed
in the motto.

1497
01:37:17,298 --> 01:37:19,018
And I get it.
You got your
marching orders...

1498
01:37:19,042 --> 01:37:21,785
and you have to do
what you have to do.

1499
01:37:23,296 --> 01:37:25,709
But you don't have
to be such a dick.

1500
01:37:29,260 --> 01:37:33,220
Put that on a plaque,
and hang it at
your next job.

1501
01:37:44,317 --> 01:37:47,435
What was it?
Sasquatch?
A unicorn?

1502
01:37:47,612 --> 01:37:49,444
The negative?
Yeah.

1503
01:37:50,114 --> 01:37:51,605
I didn't look.

1504
01:37:56,913 --> 01:37:58,996
You were
a good boss, Walter.

1505
01:38:01,292 --> 01:38:02,828
Thanks, man.

1506
01:39:21,372 --> 01:39:22,908
<i>Hey, Walter.</i>
<i>What's up?</i>

1507
01:39:23,082 --> 01:39:24,539
<i>Check this out.</i>

1508
01:39:36,888 --> 01:39:38,095
<i>See you!</i>

1509
01:39:39,891 --> 01:39:40,972
<i>Hi.</i>

1510
01:39:52,236 --> 01:39:54,569
Walter Mitty.
Severance package.

1511
01:40:36,614 --> 01:40:37,775
Hey.

1512
01:40:38,658 --> 01:40:39,944
Cheryl.

1513
01:40:41,786 --> 01:40:43,152
Hey.
Hey.

1514
01:40:43,829 --> 01:40:46,287
I got that email
from Rich yesterday.

1515
01:40:46,457 --> 01:40:47,698
He's really good.

1516
01:40:47,875 --> 01:40:49,116
Walter, thank you.

1517
01:40:49,293 --> 01:40:50,534
That was...

1518
01:40:50,711 --> 01:40:53,875
That was just
a really cool
thing to do.

1519
01:40:54,048 --> 01:40:56,040
I just saw it
in Iceland.

1520
01:40:56,634 --> 01:40:57,634
He loves it.

1521
01:40:57,802 --> 01:40:59,668
And I'm taking
him this afternoon.

1522
01:41:02,139 --> 01:41:04,005
Hey, I wanted
you to know...

1523
01:41:04,725 --> 01:41:06,307
you weren't boring me.

1524
01:41:07,186 --> 01:41:08,722
That day in the park.

1525
01:41:10,189 --> 01:41:11,396
I was...

1526
01:41:12,817 --> 01:41:13,817
I was thinking about...

1527
01:41:13,985 --> 01:41:18,150
I hope this doesn't
sound weird, but I was
thinking about you.

1528
01:41:20,074 --> 01:41:23,567
When I was in Greenland,
they do karaoke there...

1529
01:41:24,245 --> 01:41:29,331
and I had to get
on this helicopter,
with a very drunk pilot.

1530
01:41:30,209 --> 01:41:32,826
And I started
to imagine you...

1531
01:41:33,504 --> 01:41:35,541
singing Major Tom.

1532
01:41:38,342 --> 01:41:40,004
Anyway...

1533
01:41:40,928 --> 01:41:43,090
it got me
on the helicopter.

1534
01:41:43,264 --> 01:41:47,349
And it got me
where I wanted to go.

1535
01:41:49,895 --> 01:41:50,895
So, what happened
to you?

1536
01:41:51,063 --> 01:41:54,272
You sort of fell off
the face of the Earth there.

1537
01:41:54,442 --> 01:41:55,853
For a little bit.

1538
01:41:56,527 --> 01:41:58,689
I came by and...

1539
01:41:58,863 --> 01:42:01,697
your husband answered
so I figured
I should just go.

1540
01:42:03,075 --> 01:42:06,409
Phil. He was
fixing my refrigerator.

1541
01:42:06,579 --> 01:42:08,366
And he's not
my husband.

1542
01:42:09,749 --> 01:42:11,706
I guess I imagined...

1543
01:42:13,586 --> 01:42:15,873
I thought maybe you
got back together.

1544
01:42:16,589 --> 01:42:18,706
You have a good
imagination.

1545
01:42:18,883 --> 01:42:20,374
But no.

1546
01:42:22,970 --> 01:42:25,553
Hey, my sister got
this role in <i>Grease.</i>

1547
01:42:25,723 --> 01:42:26,930
Rizzo.

1548
01:42:27,099 --> 01:42:29,432
Not on Broadway.
In some weird church.

1549
01:42:32,396 --> 01:42:33,932
Do you want
to go with me?

1550
01:42:34,982 --> 01:42:36,598
I made that sound
really not good.

1551
01:42:36,776 --> 01:42:37,937
Yeah.

1552
01:42:38,819 --> 01:42:40,060
Yeah?

1553
01:42:40,404 --> 01:42:43,442
Yeah, yeah.
I would love to.

1554
01:42:43,616 --> 01:42:46,450
<i>Grease</i> in a weird church?
Are you kidding?

1555
01:42:46,619 --> 01:42:48,736
Rizzo, that's
the best part.

1556
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:51,993
Yeah, Rizzo.
Tough and tender.

1557
01:42:52,166 --> 01:42:53,577
Yeah.

1558
01:42:54,418 --> 01:42:55,750
Great.

1559
01:42:56,462 --> 01:42:58,670
Are you heading Uptown?

1560
01:42:59,340 --> 01:43:00,340
Sure.

1561
01:43:00,424 --> 01:43:01,424
Yeah?

1562
01:43:03,511 --> 01:43:05,594
I actually always
related to Rizzo more.

1563
01:43:05,763 --> 01:43:07,254
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

1564
01:43:07,431 --> 01:43:10,515
Was it the smoking
and the teenage sex?

1565
01:43:10,685 --> 01:43:13,598
No. She was
just real, I guess.

1566
01:43:13,771 --> 01:43:14,771
Oh!

1567
01:43:14,980 --> 01:43:18,144
The last issue,
it should be here.
It came out this morning.

1568
01:43:38,963 --> 01:43:41,296
Man. Walter.

1569
01:43:59,984 --> 01:44:02,351
Should we go buy
one of those?

1570
01:44:02,528 --> 01:44:04,269
Yeah. I was
probably gonna...

1571
01:44:04,447 --> 01:44:06,109
Probably gonna
go back later?
Yeah.

1572
01:44:06,282 --> 01:44:09,992
I just didn't
want to seem uncool
and get one right away.

1573

<i>just to stay alive</i>

1597
01:47:23,228 --> 01:47:26,392
<i>Dawn is coming</i>
<i>Open your eyes</i>

1598
01:47:30,569 --> 01:47:33,983
<i>Dawn is coming</i>
<i>Open your eyes</i>

1599
01:47:37,952 --> 01:47:41,821
<i>Dawn is coming</i>
<i>Open your eyes</i>

1600
01:47:45,376 --> 01:47:49,586
<i>Dawn is coming</i>
<i>Open your eyes</i>

1601
01:48:00,140 --> 01:48:04,805
<i>Look into the sun</i>
<i>as the new days rise</i>

1602
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:12,859
<i>There's a rhythm</i>
<i>in rush these days</i>

1603
01:48:15,406 --> 01:48:19,275
<i>Where the lines don't move</i>
<i>and the colors don't fade</i>

1604
01:48:22,246 --> 01:48:25,705
<i>Leaves you empty</i>
<i>with nothing but dreams</i>

1605
01:48:28,293 --> 01:48:32,287
<i>In a world gone shallow</i>
<i>In a world gone lean</i>

1606
01:48:35,259 --> 01:48:38,468
<i>But there is a truth</i>
<i>and it's on our side</i>

1607
01:48:41,724 --> 01:48:44,967
<i>Dawn is coming, open your eyes</i>

1608
01:48:48,230 --> 01:48:52,440
<i>Look into the sun</i>
<i>as a new days rise</i>

1609
01:49:02,536 --> 01:49:05,370
<i>Step outside,</i>
<i>I'm gonna step outside</i>

1610
01:49:09,168 --> 01:49:12,206
<i>Step outside,</i>
<i>I'm gonna step outside</i>

1611
01:49:25,976 --> 01:49:28,969
<i>Heart's on fire,</i>
<i>leave it all behind you</i>

1612
01:49:39,156 --> 01:49:42,570
<i>Dark as night,</i>
<i>let the lightning guide you</i>

1613
01:49:49,291 --> 01:49:52,034
<i>Step outside,</i>
<i>I'm gonna step outside</i>

1614
01:49:59,176 --> 01:50:02,590
<i>Heart's on fire,</i>
<i>leave it all behind you</i>

1615
01:50:03,305 --> 01:50:08,926
<i>Living life</i>
<i>Feeding appetites</i>

1616
01:50:09,770 --> 01:50:15,266
<i>Stake through every heart</i>
<i>stop in the mood</i>

1617
01:50:16,693 --> 01:50:19,060
<i>Being glad</i>

1618
01:50:19,822 --> 01:50:22,781
<i>Breathing half the time</i>

1619
01:50:32,543 --> 01:50:35,786
<i>Heart's on fire,</i>
<i>leave it all behind you</i>

1620
01:50:45,514 --> 01:50:49,133
<i>Dark as night,</i>
<i>let the lightning guide you</i>

1621
01:50:49,268 --> 01:50:51,851
<i>Step outside,</i>
<i>I'm gonna step outside</i>

1622
01:51:19,464 --> 01:51:22,457
<i>Broke to Monday</i>

1623
01:51:22,759 --> 01:51:25,126
<i>Something's not the same</i>

1624
01:51:26,096 --> 01:51:27,962
<i>Blank head</i>

1625
01:51:28,098 --> 01:51:30,761
<i>Cross tiles sweep the floor</i>

1626
01:51:32,728 --> 01:51:37,473
<i>Feel your presence</i>
<i>in your absence</i>

1627
01:51:37,774 --> 01:51:39,265
<i>Shut the door</i>

1628
01:51:48,577 --> 01:51:51,945
<i>Heart's on fire,</i>
<i>leave it all behind you</i>

1629
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:05,208
<i>Dark as night,</i>
<i>let the lightning guide you</i>

1630
01:52:08,222 --> 01:52:11,761
<i>Must believe in</i>

1631
01:52:11,850 --> 01:52:14,809
<i>Step outside</i>
<i>Take a step outside</i>

1632
01:52:14,895 --> 01:52:16,477
<i>Take a step outside</i>

1633
01:52:21,568 --> 01:52:25,027
<i>Must believe in</i>

1634
01:52:25,113 --> 01:52:28,072
<i>Step outside</i>
<i>Take a step outside</i>

1635
01:52:28,158 --> 01:52:29,740
<i>Take a step outside</i>

1636
01:52:35,332 --> 01:52:38,666
<i>Heart's on fire,</i>
<i>leave it all behind you</i>

1637
01:53:06,113 --> 01:53:08,480
<i>You know I love my lady</i>

1638
01:53:09,783 --> 01:53:11,900
<i>We've been together so long</i>

1639
01:53:13,370 --> 01:53:15,828
<i>Like a worn-out recording</i>

1640
01:53:17,124 --> 01:53:18,911
<i>Of my favorite song</i>

1641
01:53:20,419 --> 01:53:22,832
<i>So while she lay</i>
<i>there sleepin'</i>

1642
01:53:24,006 --> 01:53:25,918
<i>I read the paper in bed</i>

1643
01:53:27,467 --> 01:53:30,050
<i>And in the personal columns,</i>

1644
01:53:31,054 --> 01:53:32,966
<i>There was this letter</i>
<i>that read</i>

1645
01:53:34,641 --> 01:53:37,349
<i>If you like piña coladas</i>

1646
01:53:38,270 --> 01:53:40,307
<i>Or getting caught in the rain</i>

1647
01:53:42,024 --> 01:53:44,437
<i>And the feel of the ocean</i>

1648
01:53:45,569 --> 01:53:47,731
<i>And the taste of champagne</i>

1649
01:53:48,864 --> 01:53:51,277
<i>If you like making love</i>
<i>at midnight</i>

1650
01:53:52,576 --> 01:53:54,693
<i>In the dunes of the cape</i>

1651
01:53:55,954 --> 01:53:58,662
<i>Then you're the lady</i>
<i>that I look for</i>

1652
01:53:59,750 --> 01:54:01,833
<i>Come with me and escape</i>
