Time travel has not yet
been invented,

2
00:00:12,409 --> 00:00:14,750
but thirty years from now,
it will have been.

3
00:00:19,469 --> 00:00:22,022
I am one of many specialized assassins

4
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,034
in our present called Looper’s.

5
00:00:26,182 --> 00:00:29,541
So when criminal organizations
in the future need someone gone,

6
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:31,179
 they zap them back to me,

7
00:00:33,243 --> 00:00:35,314
and I eliminate the target
from the future.

8
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:37,945
Oh la la!

9
00:00:41,117 --> 00:00:42,720
Looper’s are well paid,

10
00:00:43,824 --> 00:00:44,877
we live a good life,

11
00:00:46,466 --> 00:00:47,727
and the only rule is...

12
00:00:48,942 --> 00:00:50,726
never let your target escape.

13
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:53,800
Even if your target…

14
00:00:55,609 --> 00:00:56,149
...is you.

15
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:03,243
I'm going to fix this!

16
00:01:03,275 --> 00:01:05,161
I'm going to find him and
I'm going to kill him!

17
00:01:22,655 --> 00:01:25,990
This time travel crap,
just fries your brain like a egg.

18
00:01:45,015 --> 00:01:47,015
