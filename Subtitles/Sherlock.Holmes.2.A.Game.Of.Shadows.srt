2
00:00:33,975 --> 00:00:36,046
The year was 1891.

3
00:00:37,311 --> 00:00:39,767
Storm clouds were brewing over Europe.

4
00:00:41,224 --> 00:00:44,485
France and Germany were at each others throats,

5
00:00:46,019 --> 00:00:47,400
The result of a series of bombings.

6
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:53,614
Some said it was nationalists...
Others... The anarchists.

7
00:00:55,877 --> 00:01:02,053
But as usual... My friend..., Sherlock Holmes...
Had a different theory entirely.

8
00:01:08,765 --> 00:01:11,604
Bombing in Strasbourg,
Read all about it. -Thank you.

9
00:01:12,984 --> 00:01:16,283
-Anarchists suspected in Strasbourg bombing.

10
00:02:01,238 --> 00:02:03,156
When did you start working
for the postal service?

11
00:02:05,802 --> 00:02:06,953
That was you back there?

12
00:02:07,567 --> 00:02:09,409
A Shame your activities have landed you in the gutter.

13
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:12,746
A curious parcel, Who's the intended recipient?

14
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,430
Why don't we discuss that over
dinner tonight?

15
00:02:15,622 --> 00:02:17,080
I'm free for lunch.

16
00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:17,771
Hmm... I'm not.

17
00:02:18,001 --> 00:02:19,765
How about at Savoy... Eight o'clock?

18
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,184
Splendid.

19
00:02:21,836 --> 00:02:23,103
Hmm... And will you becoming as yourself?

20
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:24,790
Most likely.

21
00:02:25,787 --> 00:02:27,896
Three men have been following you for the last half mile.

22
00:02:28,203 --> 00:02:30,313
Their motives... highly unsavoiry.

23
00:02:33,113 --> 00:02:33,689
No.

24
00:02:42,703 --> 00:02:45,350
Oh... And by the way,
They're not pursuing me,

25
00:02:45,618 --> 00:02:47,804
They're escorting me, And instead of
three, There seems to be ...

26
00:02:48,764 --> 00:02:49,953
Ah... Four

27
00:02:52,983 --> 00:02:54,326
Steady hands with that Irene.

28
00:02:55,054 --> 00:02:57,279
Oh... I don't think it's my hands you've to worry about.

29
00:02:58,008 --> 00:03:00,539
Now, be careful with the face boys,
We do have a dinner date tonight.

30
00:03:01,191 --> 00:03:02,419
Don't fill up on bread.

31
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,274
I've got the rest of it.

32
00:03:31,609 --> 00:03:33,220
Uhh... It's coming back now.

33
00:05:18,972 --> 00:05:21,542
Your payment, Doctor.
He sends his thanks.

34
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:24,112
One hundred... Thanks

35
00:05:27,219 --> 00:05:29,636
Please give this to him,
He's expecting it.

36
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,701
Tell him our friend thinks
I delivered it to his sister.

37
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:42,217
Ah... Stay
While I check the contents.

38
00:05:44,364 --> 00:05:46,973
I was assured full payment would be there.

39
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,773
Yes, But assured by whom?

40
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:51,423
Have you ever met him in person?

41
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:55,373
Hold it, Hold it, Hold it...Don't move it.

42
00:05:58,634 --> 00:06:01,319
Judging by the size and weight
its not payment you were expecting.

43
00:06:02,047 --> 00:06:04,311
I'd wager the contents are rather more incendiary.

44
00:06:04,618 --> 00:06:05,500
Who is this?

45
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:07,494
Hello, darling.

46
00:06:12,711 --> 00:06:14,361
Oh dear... I told you not to move it.

47
00:06:14,859 --> 00:06:17,007
It seems a secondary charge has been activated.

48
00:06:17,352 --> 00:06:19,578
Sweet thing, I might need your help
in the disposal of this parcel.

49
00:06:20,267 --> 00:06:21,687
One hundred...

50
00:06:25,446 --> 00:06:26,980
One million pounds!

51
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:32,005
Oh, And Um, By the way, Fire

52
00:06:38,679 --> 00:06:40,405
Leave my side and you'll be dead within an hour.

53
00:06:40,751 --> 00:06:43,819
And don't be late for dinner.
I expect that my schedule be quite tight

54
00:06:44,049 --> 00:06:45,392
because of these activities here.

55
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:47,846
I'm never late in my life.
-Only early.

56
00:06:50,801 --> 00:06:53,217
Hmm, Hmm, Very witty,
So confident even in retreat.

57
00:06:54,368 --> 00:06:55,863
I'll hold on to that.

58
00:06:56,477 --> 00:06:57,820
We will read together during an aperitif.

59
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,047
Alright.

60
00:06:59,354 --> 00:07:00,351
Dinner and a show.

61
00:07:03,497 --> 00:07:05,913
Stay.. Trust me.

62
00:07:05,913 --> 00:07:07,217
This is what I do for living.

63
00:07:08,445 --> 00:07:10,478
Hey Hoffmanstahl, You should count yourself lucky.

64
00:07:11,667 --> 00:07:14,620
This faceless man with whom you find yourself
in business is no ordinary criminal.

65
00:07:15,771 --> 00:07:16,730
He's the Napoleon of crime.

66
00:07:17,382 --> 00:07:19,607
Fortunately, You now have me as an ally.

67
00:07:21,026 --> 00:07:23,174
I'm a consulting detective of some repute...

68
00:07:23,941 --> 00:07:26,818
Perhaps you've heard of me.
My name is Sherlock Hol..

69
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,155
Holmes..

70
00:08:13,806 --> 00:08:15,800
Ah... Fresh pot of tea, Thank you George.

71
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:17,105
Yes, Miss Adler.

72
00:08:19,445 --> 00:08:21,362
Fine choice, This place.

73
00:08:23,626 --> 00:08:24,661
Do you have the letter?

74
00:08:26,234 --> 00:08:27,423
It was taken.

75
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:31,067
Taken...?
Now that is unfortunate.

76
00:08:33,752 --> 00:08:35,670
During the chaos created by your package.

77
00:08:40,657 --> 00:08:44,109
Perhaps... If you had shared your plans.

78
00:08:44,876 --> 00:08:47,177
You wish to know my plans now, Do you?

79
00:08:47,983 --> 00:08:50,898
Did you imagine Miss Adler,
That something would happen to you?

80
00:08:51,473 --> 00:08:53,852
Is that why you chose to
meet here, In a public place?

81
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:55,501
Your favorite restaurant.

82
00:09:26,341 --> 00:09:27,683
I don't blame you,

83
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:31,021
I blame myself.

84
00:09:32,784 --> 00:09:36,505
It's been apparent me for some time that you had
succumbed to your feelings for him.

85
00:09:39,114 --> 00:09:43,103
And this isn't the first occasion Mr.
Holmes has inconvenienced me in recent months.

86
00:09:46,363 --> 00:09:47,015
The question is ...

87
00:09:47,783 --> 00:09:50,237
What to do about it?

88
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,761
But ...

89
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,254
That's my problem to solve now.

90
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,197
I no longer require your services.

91
00:11:31,847 --> 00:11:32,882
Misses Hudson?

92
00:11:34,877 --> 00:11:37,101
Oooh... Misses Hudson?

93
00:11:39,595 --> 00:11:41,359
Holmes... You in there?

94
00:11:49,262 --> 00:11:50,565
Your hedge needs trimming.

95
00:12:11,317 --> 00:12:13,158
Remember... I have to catch the last.

96
00:12:18,106 --> 00:12:19,219
Train.

97
00:12:19,986 --> 00:12:22,172
You win.

98
00:12:24,896 --> 00:12:27,849
I lose...
Game over.

99
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,529
Still don't see me?

100
00:12:36,633 --> 00:12:38,705
♪ Speaking French... Quelle surprise ♪ What a surprise.

101
00:12:41,926 --> 00:12:43,997
I'm not going out with you dressed like that.

102
00:12:45,455 --> 00:12:52,819
Would you prefer I joined you in the fashion folk pathway and fine military dress...
With that Hedonist hand-made scarf?
Clearly... One of your fiancé early efforts.

103
00:12:54,469 --> 00:12:55,889
Oh... How I've missed you, Holmes.

104
00:12:56,157 --> 00:12:57,000
Have you?...

105
00:12:59,494 --> 00:13:00,722
I've Barely of noticed your absence.

106
00:13:01,296 --> 00:13:02,601
Then again I'm knee deep in research.

107
00:13:02,984 --> 00:13:04,749
Extracting fluids from the adrenal glands of sheep.

108
00:13:05,669 --> 00:13:07,472
And... Designing my own urban camouflage.

109
00:13:08,086 --> 00:13:12,574
All the while... Verging on a decisive breakthrough, In the single most important case of my career...

110
00:13:12,996 --> 00:13:14,683
Perhaps of all time.

111
00:13:16,985 --> 00:13:18,328
Misses Hudson, How are you?

112
00:13:19,094 --> 00:13:21,933
Ohh...I'm so pleased to see you Doctor,
Thank you for inviting me tomorrow.

113
00:13:22,624 --> 00:13:24,350
And thank you for looking after Gladstone.

114
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:28,684
Dear ... Dear... Simply sweet nanny.

115
00:13:29,413 --> 00:13:30,564
Might I have a word?

116
00:13:31,907 --> 00:13:32,750
Yummy!

117
00:13:33,325 --> 00:13:34,975
Feed the snake woman.

118
00:13:35,627 --> 00:13:36,969
You feed it.

119
00:13:38,273 --> 00:13:39,578
Touchy... Touchy ...

120
00:13:41,764 --> 00:13:43,222
Doctor, You must get him to a sanatorium.

121
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,981
He's been on a diet of coffee,
Tobacco, And cocoa leaves.

122
00:13:48,247 --> 00:13:48,937
He never sleeps.

123
00:13:49,474 --> 00:13:51,660
I hear multiple voices,
As if he's rehearsing a play.

124
00:13:53,348 --> 00:13:54,384
Leave him to me.

125
00:13:55,074 --> 00:13:57,299
Do not have a goat that needs... worming?

126
00:13:58,105 --> 00:13:59,447
Oh how kind of you to remind me.

127
00:14:00,444 --> 00:14:01,518
So much to look forward to.

128
00:14:02,401 --> 00:14:03,666
What I would do without you?

129
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:06,390
Patient...? Doctor.

130
00:14:07,809 --> 00:14:08,921
Why are you here?

131
00:14:10,226 --> 00:14:12,221
I'm getting married.... Tomorrow?

132
00:14:13,447 --> 00:14:15,481
Oh... Embrace me.

133
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,820
Watson's getting married.

134
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,470
You lost a few pounds.

135
00:14:19,815 --> 00:14:21,541
And you picked them up.

136
00:14:22,308 --> 00:14:24,226
Nurturing on Mary's muffins no doubt.

137
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,335
Pour us a brandy.

138
00:14:26,757 --> 00:14:27,908
The stag party has begun.

139
00:14:29,213 --> 00:14:32,320
It's our last... Adventure Watson.

140
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,008
I intend to make the most of it.

141
00:14:45,054 --> 00:14:47,279
I see you've made good use of my old office.

142
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,775
Do you like my spider's web?

143
00:14:49,158 --> 00:14:50,348
Is that what you call it?

144
00:14:50,616 --> 00:14:51,499
Follow that strand.

145
00:14:53,109 --> 00:14:54,030
Question?

146
00:14:54,298 --> 00:14:57,635
What does a scandal about an indian cotton tycoon,

147
00:14:57,865 --> 00:14:59,822
The overdose of a Chinese opium trader,

148
00:14:59,822 --> 00:15:01,357
Bombings in Strasbourg and Vienna,

149
00:15:01,357 --> 00:15:04,962
And the death of a steel magnate
in America... all have in common?

150
00:15:06,803 --> 00:15:08,913
Well... According to your diorama.

151
00:15:09,834 --> 00:15:11,598
Professor James Moriarty.

152
00:15:12,595 --> 00:15:13,631
Indeed.

153
00:15:14,322 --> 00:15:15,280
Mathematical genius.

154
00:15:16,546 --> 00:15:18,541
Celebrated author and lecturer.

155
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:22,376
Boxing champion at Cambridge...
Where he'd made friends with
our current Prime Minister.

156
00:15:23,259 --> 00:15:25,752
Do you have any evidence
to substantiate your claim?

♪ Taps ♪
-This

158
00:15:31,544 --> 00:15:32,426
Now do you see?

159
00:15:33,538 --> 00:15:35,149
Dr. Hoffmanstahl's Death?

160
00:15:35,418 --> 00:15:35,994
Yes, I've heard you speak of him.

161
00:15:36,262 --> 00:15:38,525
Extolling his virtues.

162
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:41,785
Hoffmanstahl was at the forefront of
medical innovations... A true pioneer.

163
00:15:42,092 --> 00:15:45,008
Just the other day, I averted an
explosion that was intended for him.

164
00:15:46,925 --> 00:15:48,038
It says here he died of heart attack.

165
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,607
Has all my instuction been for naught?

166
00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:55,440
You still read the offical statment and believe it? It's a game... Dear man, A shadowy game.

167
00:15:55,786 --> 00:15:59,162
We're playing cat and mouse,
the professor and I.

168
00:15:59,162 --> 00:15:59,277
Cloak and dagger.

169
00:16:00,235 --> 00:16:02,038
I thought it was spider and fly.

170
00:16:02,652 --> 00:16:04,608
I'm not a fly, I'm a cat.

171
00:16:04,991 --> 00:16:06,718
Not a mouse, But a dagger.

172
00:16:07,178 --> 00:16:08,482
You're Drinking embalming fluid.

173
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,203
Ohhh.... Yes.
Care for a drop?

174
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:14,274
- You do seem ...
- Excited?

175
00:16:14,466 --> 00:16:15,463
- Maniac.
-Ecstatic

176
00:16:15,463 --> 00:16:16,461
Psychotic.

177
00:16:19,222 --> 00:16:20,335
I should've brought you a sedative.

178
00:16:20,565 --> 00:16:21,984
I'll give my life to see his demise.

179
00:16:22,636 --> 00:16:25,091
He must be stopped...
Before his evil machinations,
Come to a crescendo.

180
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:27,776
And how will you do all this?

181
00:16:28,505 --> 00:16:31,727
No one...

182
00:16:32,686 --> 00:16:35,370
Not the victims, The
police, The governments... Not anyone!

183
00:16:36,253 --> 00:16:37,174
Except the great Sherlock Holmes.

184
00:16:37,174 --> 00:16:38,286
Correct.

185
00:16:38,632 --> 00:16:39,820
On this diet.. Will work it all out.

186
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:42,659
-Right.

187
00:16:43,388 --> 00:16:44,079
-Or thereabouts

188
00:16:44,308 --> 00:16:44,960
Thereabouts.

189
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,032
Here's to your good health.

190
00:16:52,824 --> 00:16:54,435
What you did to Gladstone now?!

191
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:58,577
The fruit is highly toxic.

192
00:16:59,229 --> 00:17:00,188
He's barely breathing.

193
00:17:01,301 --> 00:17:03,027
It was an excellent opportunity.

194
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,290
This may be just the thing.

195
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,397
I hope you don't mind terribly,
If I tried my adrenal extract.

196
00:17:09,394 --> 00:17:11,657
How many times are you going
to kill my dog, Holmes...?

197
00:17:14,918 --> 00:17:16,260
-He took off like a monkey from a box.
-Hmm

198
00:17:17,718 --> 00:17:19,061
I may need one of those in a few hours.

199
00:17:19,675 --> 00:17:20,978
Consider it a wedding gift.

200
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:22,935
Watson...

201
00:17:23,318 --> 00:17:24,737
Might we use an alternative exit?

202
00:17:26,233 --> 00:17:27,538
Is there something different about you?

203
00:17:28,612 --> 00:17:29,992
I'm under observation.

204
00:17:31,488 --> 00:17:33,291
As you should be.
You drive.

205
00:17:37,472 --> 00:17:39,812
Will your beard, Be with us... All night?

206
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,264
I'll remove it once we're
south of Trafalgar Square.

207
00:17:45,527 --> 00:17:47,867
If you believe Moriarty has you under observation,

208
00:17:48,174 --> 00:17:49,708
Isn't this a bit conspicuous?

209
00:17:50,054 --> 00:17:51,434
It's so overt, It's covert.

210
00:17:56,804 --> 00:17:57,993
Trafalgar Square...

211
00:17:58,646 --> 00:18:00,409
Why are you looking at me with such concern?

212
00:18:06,739 --> 00:18:10,498
I'm so very worried...

213
00:18:11,227 --> 00:18:15,791
Marriage... It's the end I tell you.

214
00:18:16,405 --> 00:18:18,361
- I think of it as the beginning.
- Armageddon.

215
00:18:18,553 --> 00:18:19,857
- Rebirth.
- Restriction.

216
00:18:20,087 --> 00:18:20,778
Structure.

217
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,159
Answering to a woman?

218
00:18:22,388 --> 00:18:23,693
Being in a relationship.

219
00:18:24,268 --> 00:18:26,378
A life in matrimony,
The Possibility of a family ...

220
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:29,408
Who wants to die alone?

221
00:18:30,751 --> 00:18:32,362
You'll settle down have a family and I'll...

222
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:35,967
Die alone.

223
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:37,847
Yes that's about it.

224
00:18:40,532 --> 00:18:44,597
Perhaps it's better for one to die alone
than to... live life in eternal purgatory.

225
00:18:48,818 --> 00:18:49,661
Anyway...

226
00:18:54,724 --> 00:18:55,683
Not bad... That.

227
00:18:56,374 --> 00:18:58,176
So.... Where are we going?

228
00:18:58,483 --> 00:19:01,629
In the future, There will be one of those machines
in every town in Europe.

229
00:19:01,936 --> 00:19:03,700
Loitering in the woodshed again are we my king.

230
00:19:04,007 --> 00:19:08,993
Good evening, Sherly,
I see your boot maker is ill dear brother.

231
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:12,407
As I detect that you've recently changed
the brand of soap with which you shave.

232
00:19:12,829 --> 00:19:18,046
May I point out the chimney
in the front room of Baker Street,
Is to the need of a damn good sweeping out.

233
00:19:18,698 --> 00:19:20,769
Are you aware that the hackney carriage,
By which you arrived had a damaged wheel.

234
00:19:21,805 --> 00:19:22,879
Yes, The left.

235
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:28,134
And it's plain to the meanest intelligence that you've
recently acquired a new bow for your violin.

236
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:30,704
Same bow... New Strings.

237
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:33,389
And may I deduce.. Mycroft,
Good evening by the way.

238
00:19:33,619 --> 00:19:34,309
No!

239
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:36,343
He doesn't.

240
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,296
May I deduce that you rarely strays from the path..
.

241
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:42,365
That runs from your home to the Diogenes Club,

242
00:19:42,901 --> 00:19:46,316
And never on a Monday...
When they serve your favorite potted shrimps,

243
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:50,727
Must be here for some far more important
reason than my ... Stag party.

244
00:19:52,184 --> 00:19:56,019
You know he's nothing like as slow witted
as been leading me to believe Shirley

245
00:19:56,902 --> 00:19:58,859
You're quite right Dr. Watson.

246
00:19:59,127 --> 00:20:01,083
But with all the conflict in Europe
at the monent,

247
00:20:01,812 --> 00:20:03,270
The whole situation could...
Excuse me, Suddenly erupt...

248
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,212
I'm here to avoid a dire catastrophe.

249
00:20:10,749 --> 00:20:13,204
If the concerns of two nations...

250
00:20:14,278 --> 00:20:16,043
Which will remain nameless,

251
00:20:16,733 --> 00:20:19,456
But I can tell you they
speak French and German.

252
00:20:20,837 --> 00:20:23,369
Are not dealt with tonight I shall be forced to go to switzerland

253
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:28,509
Only thing nice about Switzerland is the altitude.

254
00:20:32,037 --> 00:20:34,685
I'm so glad you invited your brother.

255
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:50,641
This looks promising...

256
00:20:51,025 --> 00:20:52,214
And your poison of choice gentlemen?

257
00:20:53,288 --> 00:20:54,093
We'll start with the champagne,

258
00:20:54,515 --> 00:20:55,589
We may need several more chairs.

259
00:20:55,973 --> 00:20:56,894
Perhaps a good cigar.

260
00:20:58,658 --> 00:21:01,190
And Um... Don't bother with the chairs

261
00:21:02,417 --> 00:21:03,682
What is it your brother does exactly?

262
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:07,020
He's... The keeper of the Broome covet of state,

263
00:21:07,403 --> 00:21:12,236
No ambition... No energy... At yet repeatedly told,

264
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,958
That he's indispensable to the British government. Particularly the foreign office.
I would like to propose a toast.

265
00:21:17,453 --> 00:21:19,218
To my dear friend, Doctor.

266
00:21:19,601 --> 00:21:20,139
John ...

267
00:21:22,363 --> 00:21:23,015
Hamish ...

268
00:21:23,706 --> 00:21:24,511
Watson.

269
00:21:25,163 --> 00:21:26,045
I'm right here.

270
00:21:26,275 --> 00:21:27,043
On the eve of his wedding, He ...

271
00:21:29,114 --> 00:21:32,605
Has been the best of companions

272
00:21:33,065 --> 00:21:33,909
Shouldn't we be waiting...?

273
00:21:34,215 --> 00:21:35,711
For the boys from my rugby club.

274
00:21:35,942 --> 00:21:38,243
He's always kept us...

275
00:21:40,276 --> 00:21:41,542
They couldn't attend... Flat footed on the ground. All of them ?

276
00:21:41,542 --> 00:21:42,999
Hmmm...what about the chaps from my medical school?

277
00:21:42,999 --> 00:21:44,380
I attempted... They declined

278
00:21:44,572 --> 00:21:45,454
There's no man better ...

279
00:21:45,723 --> 00:21:46,605
Who is it your looking for?

280
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:48,254
Worth having at your side ...

281
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,288
I don't know a single damn person here, Do I?

282
00:21:50,863 --> 00:21:53,739
There's no need for hysterics..You know me,
And you know Mycroft, Don't be a ponce, Watson

283
00:21:59,033 --> 00:22:01,334
You completely forgot about
my stag party didn't you?

284
00:22:02,677 --> 00:22:05,132
-Why are we here?
-Your in very good health Doctor

285
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:07,472
Shame none of your friends
could make it

286
00:22:14,414 --> 00:22:15,833
I'm going to the gaming tables

287
00:22:16,409 --> 00:22:18,519
I refuse for this night to be a total loss,
Give me my money

288
00:22:19,209 --> 00:22:20,628
Happily..., Give me the wedding ring

289
00:22:21,741 --> 00:22:23,773
Oh...Now you are interested in being the best man.

290
00:22:24,579 --> 00:22:25,807
You're suppose to keep the ring anyway.

291
00:22:26,497 --> 00:22:28,645
Just as your suppose to organize my stag party

292
00:22:29,067 --> 00:22:30,486
You don't want to lose it on a bet.... John.

293
00:22:30,717 --> 00:22:32,365
And invite my friends, Which by the way
there are many

294
00:22:41,878 --> 00:22:44,027
He all me, Me, Me isn't he ?

295
00:22:46,028 --> 00:23:00,028
www.renaldomovies.blogspot.com
latest movies at smallest size and highest quality

296
00:23:06,504 --> 00:23:07,961
Please sit

297
00:23:07,961 --> 00:23:09,918
Put your money on the table, and we will begin.

298
00:23:16,209 --> 00:23:18,740
Welcome, I'm madame Simza.

299
00:23:23,266 --> 00:23:25,146
Cards can illuminate your past...

300
00:23:27,409 --> 00:23:30,170
Clarify your present, And
show you the future.

301
00:23:32,856 --> 00:23:35,656
If you have a specific question
hold it in your mind.

302
00:23:46,013 --> 00:23:47,087
Holding.

303
00:23:47,853 --> 00:23:48,774
Let me know when your ready.

304
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,999
Actually, I prefer to read ...

305
00:23:52,073 --> 00:23:53,070
Your fortune.

306
00:23:57,366 --> 00:23:58,133
Temperance...

307
00:23:59,092 --> 00:24:01,662
Inverted, Indicitive of volatility.

308
00:24:02,851 --> 00:24:05,230
A woman who recently taken a confident drink,

309
00:24:06,342 --> 00:24:09,066
From what does she seek solace?,
What does she wish not to see?

310
00:24:10,983 --> 00:24:12,326
Hmm, A fool imbarassing himself?

311
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:15,663
Oh, Yes the fool

312
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:19,882
Someone had been led astray, Involved
in something without their knowledge.

313
00:24:20,726 --> 00:24:24,063
Not bad. But um... You have to make me believe you,

314
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,751
I have to see it in your eyes.

315
00:24:26,787 --> 00:24:27,823
I can do better....

316
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,620
The two of cups, A powerful bond..

317
00:24:31,889 --> 00:24:32,770
But between whom?

318
00:24:33,691 --> 00:24:35,225
A brother and a sister perhaps?

319
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,524
And I see a name ... Yes.. it's,

320
00:24:39,483 --> 00:24:40,903
Rene.

321
00:24:42,475 --> 00:24:43,549
What do you want?

322
00:24:44,393 --> 00:24:45,467
The devil.

323
00:24:50,109 --> 00:24:51,489
Why are we playing this game?

324
00:25:00,886 --> 00:25:01,731
Where did you get this?

325
00:25:02,191 --> 00:25:04,300
I stole it from a woman in an auction room.

326
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,295
But I believe It was intended for you.

327
00:25:21,983 --> 00:25:22,904
Found my purpose in life,

328
00:25:23,901 --> 00:25:26,778
So... that question I've been holding is
what purpose is Rene fulfilling?

329
00:25:31,189 --> 00:25:32,532
Time is up

330
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:34,373
I have other clients.

331
00:25:40,395 --> 00:25:42,965
Though you may not have detected the wisp of
Astrakhan fur snagged on a nail from my left shoulder...

332
00:25:43,349 --> 00:25:46,954
You couldn't have failed to notice
the overpowering aroma of herring pickled in vodka.

333
00:25:47,223 --> 00:25:52,325
In tandem with a turely unfortunate body odor.

334
00:25:53,321 --> 00:25:55,930
there's a man conceled in the rafters above us.

335
00:25:56,736 --> 00:26:01,339
A CORSAC, Renouned for their infesible
acrobatic abilities, And are notorious for their hunting... Us assassins

336
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:07,360
So it's safe to presume your
next client is here to kill you.

337
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:09,163
Anything else?

338
00:26:09,509 --> 00:26:10,276
No..?

339
00:26:16,643 --> 00:26:17,602
First...

340
00:26:17,794 --> 00:26:18,676
Pillage the nest.

341
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:23,701
Clip wings.

342
00:26:25,465 --> 00:26:26,002
Now ...

343
00:26:26,271 --> 00:26:27,614
Blunt his beak.

344
00:26:32,562 --> 00:26:33,558
Crack eggs.

345
00:26:35,784 --> 00:26:36,858
Scramble

346
00:26:37,165 --> 00:26:37,969
Pinch of salt.

347
00:26:40,962 --> 00:26:42,227
Touch of pepper.

348
00:26:47,943 --> 00:26:48,863
Flip the omelette.

349
00:26:53,658 --> 00:26:55,116
Additional seasoning required

350
00:26:57,379 --> 00:26:59,795
Breakfast is served.

351
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:13,757
Come with me.

352
00:27:13,987 --> 00:27:15,484
I need you alive.... Now!

Now... Wait a minute...

358
00:30:31,376 --> 00:30:33,486
Your right... It is sick

359
00:30:34,368 --> 00:30:35,404
Where were you?

360
00:30:46,758 --> 00:30:50,057
I am so glad to see your taking
your best man duties so seriously Sherlock.

361

She biting my leg...

362
00:30:55,504 --> 00:30:58,572
I'll have Carruthers put some
fuel into that motor carriage of yours

363
00:30:58,956 --> 00:31:01,103
You do have a wedding to attend

364
00:31:01,525 --> 00:31:02,331
Oh... I'll drive

365
00:31:08,123 --> 00:31:09,351
Another drink?

366
00:31:10,309 --> 00:31:11,038
I think you've had quite enough.

367
00:33:34,841 --> 00:33:36,107
I've been to a wedding here before,

368
00:33:39,674 --> 00:33:40,787
A funeral too.

369
00:33:43,932 --> 00:33:45,275
The Professor wants to meet.

370
00:33:47,154 --> 00:33:48,765
I'd expected to hear from him sooner.

371
00:33:49,724 --> 00:33:51,181
In light of recent events ...

372
00:33:51,603 --> 00:33:55,208
He was wondering if it would be convient for
you to come by the college, This afternoon.

373
00:33:56,475 --> 00:33:58,355
His lecture concludes at four.

374
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,118
Looking forward.

375
00:34:01,653 --> 00:34:02,881

This fish you can not cheat.

379
00:34:41,737 --> 00:34:43,041
I hope I'm not intruding

380
00:34:44,345 --> 00:34:46,838
Ahh.. Excuse me, Please take these up to Mr. Williams and make sure

381
00:34:47,107 --> 00:34:50,329
he packs my white tie and tails.
-I'll take care of it professor.
-Thank you

382
00:34:50,981 --> 00:34:52,668
I do apologize, I'm off on a blasted lecture tour.

383
00:34:54,778 --> 00:34:55,737
Would you care for some tea or coffee?

384
00:34:56,044 --> 00:34:57,003
Neither.

385
00:34:57,501 --> 00:34:58,384
Something stronger perhaps?

386
00:34:58,614 --> 00:35:02,143
No... but might I trouble you for an inscription?

387
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,475
I read that the good doctor
was to be married today.

388
00:35:22,741 --> 00:35:24,045
How was the service?

389
00:35:24,275 --> 00:35:25,426
Definitive.

390
00:35:25,771 --> 00:35:27,728
He'll no longer be party to my investigations,

391
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:29,146
He's out of the equation, I....

392
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,790
Trust you'll take this into consideration?

393
00:35:37,393 --> 00:35:39,312
And what considerations will you grant me?

394
00:35:47,942 --> 00:35:49,246
Have you actually read the book?

395
00:35:49,592 --> 00:35:51,279
I found it compelling.

396
00:35:52,276 --> 00:35:54,961
Thought I'm primarily intrested
in your more recent endevors...

397
00:35:56,956 --> 00:35:58,491
I take that as a compliment.

398
00:35:59,794 --> 00:36:02,019
I have the utmost regard
for your talents.

399
00:36:03,554 --> 00:36:05,970
It's a pleasure...
To finally meet you.

400
00:36:07,543 --> 00:36:08,540
Officially.

401
00:36:12,415 --> 00:36:14,907
Are you familiar with
the study of graphology?

402
00:36:16,327 --> 00:36:18,398
I've never given it any serious thought no.

403

Psychological Analysis of Handwriting.

404
00:36:21,735 --> 00:36:24,152
The upward strokes on the
P, the J and M indicate,

405
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,261
A Genius level intellect.

406
00:36:26,836 --> 00:36:31,094
While the flourishes on the lower zone,
Denote a highly creative yet...

407
00:36:31,746 --> 00:36:32,322
Meticulous nature.

408
00:36:32,322 --> 00:36:36,426
But... If one observes the overall slant
and the pressure of the writing...

409
00:36:36,886 --> 00:36:38,076
There's a suggestion of acute narcissism,

410
00:36:38,383 --> 00:36:39,763
A complete lack of empathy,

411
00:36:40,146 --> 00:36:41,374
And a pronounced inclination toward ...

412
00:36:41,643 --> 00:36:42,218
No!

413
00:36:42,448 --> 00:36:43,676
Moral insanity.

414
00:36:45,325 --> 00:36:48,623
An answer to your previous request, Regarding,

415
00:36:49,237 --> 00:36:50,772
Doctor Watson, Not being involved the answer is...

416
00:36:51,539 --> 00:36:52,652
No.

417
00:36:53,802 --> 00:36:57,561
The laws of celestrial mechanics dictate
that when two objects collide,

418
00:36:59,632 --> 00:37:00,707
there is always damage ...

419
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:03,276
Of a collateral nature.

420
00:37:07,956 --> 00:37:11,792
Two gentlemen, Find themselfs at
cross purposes...

421
00:37:13,441 --> 00:37:14,439
A young woman ...

422
00:37:15,397 --> 00:37:16,433
Torn between them.

423
00:37:17,123 --> 00:37:19,234
The strain proves to much for her

424
00:37:19,962 --> 00:37:21,458
And she suddenly falls ill.

425
00:37:22,455 --> 00:37:24,871
With... Tragic consequences.

426
00:37:28,478 --> 00:37:30,088
A rare form of tuberculosis.

427
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:34,308
She succumbed in a matter of seconds.

428
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:39,294
Now ...

429
00:37:41,596 --> 00:37:43,322
Are you sure you want to play this game?

430
00:37:45,432 --> 00:37:47,042
I'm afraid you'd lose.

431
00:37:49,728 --> 00:37:50,687
Rest assured...

432
00:37:51,645 --> 00:37:56,824
If you attempt to bring destruction down upon me... I shall do the same to you.

433
00:37:58,051 --> 00:38:00,889
My respect for you, Mr. Holmes,
Is the only reason

434
00:38:01,388 --> 00:38:03,422
your still alive.

435
00:38:05,454 --> 00:38:07,104
You've paid me several compliments.

436
00:38:07,372 --> 00:38:08,676
Let me pay you one in return,

437
00:38:14,737 --> 00:38:15,542
When I said if I were assured of the
former eventuality,

438
00:38:15,811 --> 00:38:17,115
I will cheerfully accept the latter.

439
00:38:21,104 --> 00:38:23,981
I'll be sure to send my regards to the happy couple.

440
00:38:27,586 --> 00:38:29,543
Another time then...

441
00:38:52,174 --> 00:38:53,133
Which coach are we?

442
00:38:53,516 --> 00:38:54,130
We should be just....

443
00:38:54,705 --> 00:38:55,434
Here.

444
00:38:58,004 --> 00:38:59,577
Ohh..., First Class.

445
00:39:06,252 --> 00:39:07,939

447
00:39:12,849 --> 00:39:14,690
Ohh... First class Champagne

448
00:39:15,342 --> 00:39:17,221
You know how to spoil a girl Mr. Watson.

449
00:39:17,873 --> 00:39:19,063
Your not just any girl.

450
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,822
I'm Sorry madam but you can't use the lavatory
while the train is in station.

451
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:28,844
Your... Mrs. Watson.

452
00:39:30,992 --> 00:39:31,989
Give me that bottle.

453
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,751
John there is no where else in the
world I'd rather be.

454
00:39:49,941 --> 00:39:51,398
There's no one I'd rather be with.

455
00:39:52,817 --> 00:39:54,927
Why do you have a gun stuffed down
the back of your trousers?

456
00:39:56,384 --> 00:39:57,152
Heh, Old habits.

457
00:40:01,985 --> 00:40:02,637
Ahem... Come in

458
00:40:05,974 --> 00:40:07,432
-Oh yes please
-We didn't order that

459
00:40:07,892 --> 00:40:09,005
With our Compliments sir.

460
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,498
Thank you, Put it there.

461
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:27,416
Open the door John.

462
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,325
I think it's time for you to leave.

463
00:40:38,578 --> 00:40:39,422

467
00:41:10,147 --> 00:41:10,760
They'll be back.

468
00:41:11,528 --> 00:41:12,294
Ohh...John, Shut the door.

469
00:41:12,486 --> 00:41:13,522
They'll only shoot through it my lovey.

470
00:41:13,522 --> 00:41:14,289
He's right.

Huh... I understand.

Do you?

473
00:41:19,237 --> 00:41:20,350
Terribly inconvenient.

474
00:41:22,267 --> 00:41:23,073
We don't have much time!

475
00:41:29,401 --> 00:41:30,476
How many are we expecting?

476
00:41:30,783 --> 00:41:31,627
Half a dozen.

477

- A wedding present from Moriarty.

478

Lovely ceremony by the way,
Many a tears shed in joy.

Oh.. John!

480
00:41:39,528 --> 00:41:40,526
Just a minute darling.

481

Do you trust me?

No.

Well, then I should have to...

484

00:42:07,721 --> 00:42:08,757
She's safe now!

490
00:42:12,056 --> 00:42:13,821
In my own defense... I timed it perfectly.

491
00:42:15,086 --> 00:42:15,968
You killed my wife!

492
00:42:24,598 --> 00:42:26,478
How do you know that when
you just threw her off a train?

493
00:42:26,862 --> 00:42:29,700
I told you I'd timed it perfectly.

494
00:42:30,084 --> 00:42:31,005
What does that mean?

495
00:42:35,109 --> 00:42:35,608
Calm down!

496
00:42:36,221 --> 00:42:37,103
Explain!

497
00:42:37,487 --> 00:42:38,829
By the time I'd explain we'd both be dead!

498
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:52,907
I'm sorry madam but you can't use the lavatory
while the train is in station.

499
00:43:45,610 --> 00:43:46,454
That was no accident.

500
00:43:48,218 --> 00:43:49,139
It was by design.

501
00:43:53,128 --> 00:43:53,703
Now ...

502
00:43:54,739 --> 00:43:56,427
Do you need me to elaborate?

503
00:43:58,421 --> 00:43:59,918
Or can we just crack on.

504
00:44:07,666 --> 00:44:08,318
Come on!

505
00:44:11,655 --> 00:44:14,493
Do not worry old boy, She's as safe as
houses, she's with my brother.

506
00:44:17,217 --> 00:44:18,713
I'm on my honeymoon!

507
00:44:19,748 --> 00:44:20,937
Why did you lead them here?

508
00:44:21,628 --> 00:44:22,625
Why did you involve us?

509
00:44:22,894 --> 00:44:24,466
There not here for me, There here for you!

510
00:44:30,757 --> 00:44:31,409
Fortunately ...

511
00:44:39,272 --> 00:44:40,769
So am I.

512
00:44:41,076 --> 00:44:41,880
Now mind the door!

513
00:44:43,223 --> 00:44:43,990
Good evening.

514
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:49,591
I think you'll find second class
is more comforable,

515
00:44:50,357 --> 00:44:52,506

516
00:44:53,081 --> 00:44:53,810
To the south!, Quick march!

517
00:45:01,328 --> 00:45:02,594
Lie down with me Watson.

518
00:45:03,629 --> 00:45:04,204
Why?

519
00:45:05,317 --> 00:45:05,854

520
00:45:12,912 --> 00:45:13,947

521
00:45:14,561 --> 00:45:15,636

Your window of opportunity.

527
00:45:49,965 --> 00:45:50,656
Make it count!

528
00:45:58,673 --> 00:45:59,824
I said make it count!

529
00:46:00,783 --> 00:46:02,623
How many windows have I provide?

530
00:46:22,224 --> 00:46:25,485

in Brighton was such a dangerous notion?

00:46:25,868 --> 00:46:26,904

533

I've never been to Brighton.

534
00:46:31,852 --> 00:46:32,466
Or ...

535
00:46:32,964 --> 00:46:34,460
Your just to fragile to
remember at present.

536
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:35,688
Oh, shut up!

537
00:46:36,609 --> 00:46:37,836
Tell me that my wife's safe?

538
00:46:38,104 --> 00:46:39,485
I can't do both.

539
00:46:39,869 --> 00:46:40,866
I promise.

540
00:46:41,288 --> 00:46:42,707
As I said, I timed it perfectly.

541
00:46:50,608 --> 00:46:51,606
Over here... Madam.

542
00:46:53,486 --> 00:46:55,979
I believe congratulations
are in order Mrs. Watson.

543
00:46:59,432 --> 00:47:00,965
I'm the other Holmes.

544
00:47:03,536 --> 00:47:04,724
You mean there's two of you?

545

Oh how marvelous, Could this evening get any better?

546
00:47:07,870 --> 00:47:09,634
Why were Mary and I targeted at all?

547
00:47:10,363 --> 00:47:11,207
Excellent question.

548
00:47:12,013 --> 00:47:13,048
The answer is two fold.

549
00:47:13,355 --> 00:47:14,314
He's after us...

550
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:15,196
Because of you.

551
00:47:15,733 --> 00:47:17,612
I afraid you must bear half the responsibility.

552
00:47:18,073 --> 00:47:18,802
Here ... it comes

553
00:47:19,339 --> 00:47:21,065
Had you and Mary had not been
so hellbent on your wedding,

554
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:23,059
We could've already solved this case.

555
00:47:23,481 --> 00:47:24,441
There it is... It's my fault now

556
00:47:24,824 --> 00:47:26,090
All I'm saying is that the
argument could mean...

557
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:26,818
No, It couldn't

558
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:28,430
That your nuptials were rather poorly timed.

559
00:47:30,386 --> 00:47:32,380
Thus ...

560
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:33,455
Our relationship ...

561
00:47:33,953 --> 00:47:34,721
Relationship?

562
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:36,638
Very well.. partnership

My dear fellow if you could be bothered
to see this through to the end,

565
00:47:44,846 --> 00:47:46,534
I shall never again ask you to assist me.

566

That's the spirit!

568
00:47:56,546 --> 00:47:57,581
Now... To the question,

569
00:47:57,965 --> 00:47:59,077
This is so deliciously complicated,

570
00:47:59,499 --> 00:48:02,146
You may be asking yourself?

571
00:48:02,452 --> 00:48:03,872
What does a crimial mastermind want
with a simple gypsy fortune teller?

572
00:48:04,332 --> 00:48:05,407
It's about her brother I tell you.

Outside the city at Montroy,

582
00:48:47,715 --> 00:48:50,400
There's a Gypsy camp famous for it's dried fruit,

583
00:48:50,784 --> 00:48:51,512
Especially peaches.

584

However ...

800
01:08:19,197 --> 01:08:21,728
The bomb was meant to conceal
the murder of just one man,

801
01:08:22,265 --> 01:08:25,563
The man killed by the gunshot was
none other than Alfred Meinhardt.

802
01:08:28,593 --> 01:08:29,783

Moriarty.

807
01:08:37,761 --> 01:08:39,065
The clues point in one direction,

808
01:08:39,794 --> 01:08:43,553
To avoid repeating last night's debacle,
I was obliged to collect more suffient data,

809
01:08:44,666 --> 01:08:47,120
Hence my tardyness.

But ...

813
01:09:22,371 --> 01:09:24,596
Do we have enough time for me to indulge my little habit?

814
01:09:25,325 --> 01:09:26,323
Yes.

But.... Taking ten minutes to get to

01:09:48,033 --> 01:09:50,794
Where he will be just in time to
catch the 11:04 train to Berlin.

822
01:09:51,677 --> 01:09:53,287
It makes several stops along the way,
One of which is....

823
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:55,244
Heilbron.

824
01:09:56,625 --> 01:09:57,584
Exactly ...

825
01:09:58,005 --> 01:09:59,195
Where we must go.

826
01:09:59,808 --> 01:10:01,113
Where Meinhardt's factory is.

827
01:10:01,381 --> 01:10:02,570
It's Moriarty's factory now.

828
01:10:03,797 --> 01:10:05,908
Unfortunately, Due to the
bombing, The crossing between,

829
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:08,055
France and Germany is to be closed.

830
01:10:08,784 --> 01:10:12,044
I afraid our persuit is over...
Unless I can happen upon a comrade

831
01:10:12,927 --> 01:10:15,420
How knows their way around borders...

832
01:10:17,837 --> 01:10:19,026
Too English.

833
01:10:21,404 --> 01:10:23,821
However you do make a fantastic Gypsy.

834
01:10:23,821 --> 01:10:25,661
Certainly smell like a fantastic gypsy.

835
01:10:25,968 --> 01:10:27,311
Now.. Now.. No need to be demeaning.

836
01:10:28,769 --> 01:10:29,881
It is a nice scarf.

837
01:10:31,070 --> 01:10:31,876
No no.. too English.

838
01:10:32,873 --> 01:10:33,831
It'll suit you more

839
01:10:34,752 --> 01:10:36,939
The black is yours... The gray one is mine,

840
01:10:37,706 --> 01:10:38,664
And this is for you.

841
01:10:40,391 --> 01:10:43,076
Ah hmm right, Where are the wagons?

842
01:10:43,459 --> 01:10:45,684
The wagon's to slow,
Can't you ride?

843
01:10:49,175 --> 01:10:52,128
It's not the he can't ride,
How is it you put it, Hon?

844
01:10:52,857 --> 01:10:55,236
They're dangerous at both ends
and crafty in the middle.

845
01:10:56,654 --> 01:10:58,572
Why would I want anything with a mind of its own
bobbing about between my legs?

846
01:11:01,794 --> 01:11:03,521
Then I should require a bicycle, Thank you very much.

847
01:11:03,866 --> 01:11:06,320
It's 1891.... I could've chartered a balloon.

848
01:11:09,389 --> 01:11:10,847
How can we make this more manageable?

849
01:11:34,629 --> 01:11:36,354
It's not as if Germany going somewhere...

850
01:11:45,368 --> 01:11:46,634
We know another way.

851
01:11:52,887 --> 01:11:54,152
Slow and steady wins the race.

852
01:12:11,797 --> 01:12:12,602
Go on!

853
01:12:27,754 --> 01:12:29,441
We slip in through the loading bay,

854
01:12:30,515 --> 01:12:32,280
Find out what he's doing, And we get out.

855
01:12:33,776 --> 01:12:35,233
Getting out might be tricky.

856
01:12:35,502 --> 01:12:37,113
We will get you out.

857
01:12:37,344 --> 01:12:39,261
If my brother is in there, Get him out alive.

858
01:12:55,525 --> 01:12:56,176
Ahh ...You happy?

859
01:12:58,133 --> 01:12:58,517
What?

860
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:02,314
At this moment.... Are you as happy as you
would be on your honeymoon in Brighton?

861
01:13:04,616 --> 01:13:06,303
I'm not going to grace that question with an answer.

862
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:10,407
Are you happy?

863
01:13:10,829 --> 01:13:12,402
- Are We here for another reason?, I think we are
- Okay.

864
01:13:12,863 --> 01:13:13,438
Should we get on.

865
01:13:13,707 --> 01:13:14,320
It was a simple question.

866
01:13:14,512 --> 01:13:16,622
Are we gonna do something or wait here
for them to come back around.

867
01:13:16,814 --> 01:13:18,118
What time is it?

868
01:13:18,923 --> 01:13:19,728
Three fifteen.

869
01:13:19,959 --> 01:13:22,950
Over in the rest of the part of the
complex should be a telegraph office,

870
01:13:23,909 --> 01:13:26,288
Send this to Mycroft,
Be back here on the hour.

871
01:13:40,289 --> 01:13:55,289

872

Thats what you get Mr. Holmes, When the
industry marries arms,

873
01:16:14,448 --> 01:16:15,637
Now put your gun down.

874
01:16:17,823 --> 01:16:18,820
It's a bit ol fashioned.

875
01:16:24,536 --> 01:16:25,724
What you need is one of these...

876
01:16:27,719 --> 01:16:28,640
Go on,

877
01:16:31,402 --> 01:16:32,399
Pick one.

878
01:16:35,352 --> 01:16:36,925
Machine pistol, Self repeating.

879
01:16:39,418 --> 01:16:42,142
It takes 7.63 caliber rounds.

880
01:16:43,752 --> 01:16:44,673
In one of these.

881
01:16:48,087 --> 01:16:49,468
A ten shot box... Magazine.

882
01:16:52,307 --> 01:16:53,265
Easy enough to load.

883
01:16:55,337 --> 01:16:58,175
How should one have to retract the
bolt to ingage the first round.

884
01:16:59,787 --> 01:17:01,053
Easier done than said.

885
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:12,022
Take him to the surgery,

886
01:17:13,020 --> 01:17:14,478
I'll find the doctor.

887
01:17:25,716 --> 01:17:27,136
Come at once if convenient,

888
01:17:29,974 --> 01:17:32,161
If inconvenient come all the same.

889
01:17:44,435 --> 01:17:46,352
This is schnapps.

890
01:17:46,889 --> 01:17:48,462
A telegram was sent from here.

891
01:17:50,955 --> 01:17:53,986
This isn't schnapps, It's aqua vida,
Distilled from potato mash...

892
01:17:54,983 --> 01:17:57,131
A common misconception, Thank you by the way.

893
01:17:58,129 --> 01:17:59,280
Who was it sent to?

894
01:18:00,084 --> 01:18:04,457
Horror at your crimes is matched only by my

895
01:18:05,455 --> 01:18:06,030
Admiration at the skill it took to achive them.

896
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:07,757
Who was it sent to?

897
01:18:09,175 --> 01:18:12,590
you used the anarchists and their bombs
to create a crisis in Europe.

898
01:18:12,934 --> 01:18:13,701
Nation against nation.

899
01:18:14,584 --> 01:18:18,112
Under various pseudo names you bought, Schemed,
Or murdered your way into numerous industries,

Assuring none of it could be traced to you.

901
01:18:22,447 --> 01:18:23,905
Cotton, Opium, Steel.

902
01:18:24,135 --> 01:18:26,820
Now arms, Chemical weaponary all to be
shipped across Europe

903
01:18:27,395 --> 01:18:28,431
in less than a week.

904
01:18:29,390 --> 01:18:31,307
Everything from bullets to bandages.

905
01:18:32,075 --> 01:18:34,415
And now that you own the supply...

906
01:18:34,645 --> 01:18:35,680
You intend to create the demand.

907
01:18:37,982 --> 01:18:39,095
A World War!

908
01:18:43,775 --> 01:18:45,270
You are familiar with Schubert's work?

909
01:18:50,065 --> 01:18:53,210
A Trout is uh... Perhaps my favorite.

910
01:18:55,857 --> 01:18:59,386
A fisherman grows weary of
trying to catch an elusive fish.

911
01:19:01,074 --> 01:19:02,914
Out the way... Out the way...

912
01:19:04,104 --> 01:19:05,331
So he muddies the water.

913
01:19:06,405 --> 01:19:07,287
I'm Warnin ya....

914
01:19:08,016 --> 01:19:09,474
Confusses the fish...

915
01:19:14,844 --> 01:19:15,802
You were warned.

916
01:19:16,493 --> 01:19:19,217
He doesn't realize until too late
that he's swum into a trap...

917
01:21:00,711 --> 01:21:02,207
Let's try this again... shall we?

918
01:21:03,050 --> 01:21:05,736
To whom... Did you sent the telegram?

919
01:21:21,385 --> 01:21:22,997
To my brother, Mycroft.

920
01:21:26,756 --> 01:21:27,907
What are you planning...?

921
01:21:31,781 --> 01:21:32,740
Thats not fair.

922
01:21:35,616 --> 01:21:37,151
I just got one more question for you,

923
01:21:43,556 --> 01:21:47,584
Which one of us is the fisherman,
And which the trout?

924
01:22:17,196 --> 01:22:17,657
Holmes?

925
01:22:20,533 --> 01:22:22,068
Holmes?

Always good to see you Watson.

928
01:22:54,556 --> 01:22:55,784
-What were you thinking?,
-Wait... Wait.

929
01:22:58,775 --> 01:23:01,806
If you must know, I was thinking I had him,
Right were I wanted him.

930
01:23:06,793 --> 01:23:08,672
Right... Crack on then

You were marrying Gladstone,

He had a massive fork in his hoof
and he turned on me!

Your wedding present.

01:31:08,488 --> 01:31:09,293
And Who's been dancing on my chest!?

Why is my ankle so itchy?

970

985
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:17,493
Via Switzerland.

986
01:32:19,987 --> 01:32:23,746
What better place to start a
war... Than a peace summit...

987
01:32:25,241 --> 01:32:26,891
We'll drop in and see my brother,

988
01:32:46,147 --> 01:32:47,949
I still do not understand why you
simply don't cancel the summit

989
01:32:48,486 --> 01:32:50,290
The fact is it's gonna happen
whether we like it or not.

990
01:32:51,057 --> 01:32:52,284
Everyone has already arrived.

991
01:32:53,051 --> 01:32:57,117
While ladies and gentlemen may be talking peace,
Believe me they're readying their armies at home

992
01:32:57,961 --> 01:32:59,879
To cancel the summit now...
Would mean tentamental war.

993
01:33:00,454 --> 01:33:01,528
The telegram wasn't it clear?

994
01:33:01,988 --> 01:33:03,523
We have doubled the security, sir.

995
01:33:04,175 --> 01:33:05,786
Oh... Doubled security?, Thats confident

996
01:33:06,131 --> 01:33:08,011
You can't understand the
delicacy the situation.

997
01:33:08,701 --> 01:33:11,578
I passes the telegram on to my superiors,
but they were the ones

998
01:33:11,770 --> 01:33:13,573
who have brought Moriarty

999
01:33:14,569 --> 01:33:16,526
He has positioned himself brilliantly

1000
01:33:16,871 --> 01:33:18,520
As one of our formost intellectuals,
he's a personal friend

1001
01:33:19,096 --> 01:33:20,362
Personal friend of the Prime Minister, Yes..
We all know that

1002
01:33:21,513 --> 01:33:22,739
I believe you.....

1003
01:33:23,277 --> 01:33:24,466
But where's your evidence?

1004
01:33:25,310 --> 01:33:27,764
He's too good to leave evidence....

1005
01:33:28,263 --> 01:33:29,337
He doesn't leave loose ends.

1006
01:33:30,834 --> 01:33:31,638
Ohh he's alive!

1007
01:33:32,329 --> 01:33:33,403
Sherly, Put that down!

1008
01:33:34,401 --> 01:33:35,590
What is this contraption?

1009
01:33:36,126 --> 01:33:37,507
May I have it?

1010
01:33:38,045 --> 01:33:40,078
The effect is most invigorating.

1011
01:33:40,423 --> 01:33:41,420
It is my private and
personal supply of oxygen,

1012
01:33:41,727 --> 01:33:42,686
And your not to touch it.

1013
01:33:43,453 --> 01:33:44,834
This argument is getting us nowhere.

1014
01:33:45,294 --> 01:33:47,788
I've arranged doctuments to be prepared
which will allow you into the ball.

1015
01:33:49,207 --> 01:33:49,820
-Carruthers.
-Stanley?

1016
01:33:50,395 --> 01:33:51,124
Stanley?

1017
01:33:52,429 --> 01:33:53,657
You haven't aged a day.

1018
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:55,996
Is that my favorite Chutney?

1019
01:33:56,303 --> 01:33:57,454
The fact is...

1020
01:33:57,799 --> 01:33:59,256
We don't really know what he's planning,

1021
01:34:00,254 --> 01:34:01,443
It won't be another bomb.

1022
01:34:01,788 --> 01:34:03,015
No... It wouldn't be another bomb.

1023
01:34:03,245 --> 01:34:04,358
That doesn't make sense.

1024
01:34:04,626 --> 01:34:06,430
Why would attack all the nations,
Only to unite them?

1025
01:34:07,082 --> 01:34:08,270
It shall be an assassination.

1026
01:34:09,651 --> 01:34:10,841
By a lone gunman.

1027
01:34:11,378 --> 01:34:12,221
At close range.

1028
01:34:13,334 --> 01:34:14,024
Rene.

1029
01:34:15,213 --> 01:34:16,019
Unfortunately yes..

1030
01:34:17,399 --> 01:34:18,474
You knew ?

1031
01:34:18,896 --> 01:34:19,855
I had my suspicions.

1032
01:34:20,277 --> 01:34:22,271
But having seen who'd be
attending, I'm now certain.

1033
01:34:23,844 --> 01:34:25,608
Well... At least we know
who to look out for.

1034
01:34:26,298 --> 01:34:27,641
Rene will be the evidence.

1035
01:34:27,910 --> 01:34:30,748
If we find him and stop him, we will
perhaps not only save his life,

1036
01:34:31,170 --> 01:34:33,318
But prevent the collapse of
western civilization.

1037
01:34:35,082 --> 01:34:35,926
No pressure ...

1038
01:35:07,571 --> 01:35:08,415
Welcome Ambassador.

1039
01:35:11,330 --> 01:35:12,673
Professor James Moriarty.

1040
01:35:28,821 --> 01:35:31,277
Now we're all present,
I can tell you the targets,

1041
01:35:31,622 --> 01:35:32,887
Are the German Chancellor and his ambassador,

1042
01:35:34,307 --> 01:35:35,803
The french Prime Minister and his man,

1043
01:35:36,263 --> 01:35:38,257
And the other nations are really
working out which side to take,

1044
01:35:38,526 --> 01:35:40,713
Should hostilities erupt.

1045
01:35:41,057 --> 01:35:43,206
Cause uh Prince Michael is a cousin
of the Tsar and the Russian ambassador,

1046
01:35:43,551 --> 01:35:45,814
Archduke Karl Ludwig, and the
austro-Hungarian ambassador,

1047
01:35:47,156 --> 01:35:49,228
Romanian Prime Minister
and his ambassador.

1048
01:35:50,148 --> 01:35:52,987
And of course, Our Prime Minister
and the British ambassador.

1049
01:35:53,447 --> 01:35:56,899
He'll chose a moment when all the dignitaries
are assembled... Preferably standing still,

1050
01:35:57,590 --> 01:35:59,009
Is there to be an offical photograph?

1051
01:35:59,277 --> 01:36:02,500
Indeed, Yes in uh 38 minutes.

1052
01:36:03,152 --> 01:36:04,954
Then in which case...
We might as well dance.

1053
01:36:11,092 --> 01:36:12,357
I've never done this before.

1054
01:36:13,470 --> 01:36:15,848
Just.. follow.. my... lead...

1055
01:36:30,270 --> 01:36:31,076
What do you see?

1056
01:36:31,498 --> 01:36:32,112
Everything.

1057
01:36:43,274 --> 01:36:44,463
That is my curse.

1058
01:36:46,112 --> 01:36:47,494
But you don't see what you are looking for.

1059
01:37:05,981 --> 01:37:07,784
I thought you'd never ask.

1060
01:37:10,354 --> 01:37:14,459
Over my shoulder, Young man,
German uniform, ceremonial sword.

1061
01:37:16,146 --> 01:37:17,067
Got it

1062
01:37:18,180 --> 01:37:19,445
Professional opinion?

1063
01:37:20,941 --> 01:37:24,355
Trauma...
Major injury...

1064
01:37:25,621 --> 01:37:27,462
Excellent repair work.

1065
01:37:29,341 --> 01:37:30,492
Dr. Hoffmanstahl.

1066
01:37:31,566 --> 01:37:34,596
You did say he was at the forefront
of medical inovation

1067
01:37:34,942 --> 01:37:36,553
Before you'd seen an example of his skills

1068
01:37:38,317 --> 01:37:40,082
Those twins weren't twins.

1069
01:37:40,696 --> 01:37:43,112
My suspicions where arroused in Heilbron,

1070
01:37:43,841 --> 01:37:45,682
When one failed to go to the aid of the other.

1071
01:37:46,525 --> 01:37:49,518
I also noticed a descrete but
unmistakable puckering behind the ear

1072
01:37:50,629 --> 01:37:52,241
Where his skin was had been drawn back.

1073
01:37:52,548 --> 01:37:55,347
I should've realized then, That
they were a surgical experiment.

1074
01:37:57,074 --> 01:37:59,797
To see if it's possible to
make one man look like another?

1075
01:38:00,564 --> 01:38:02,099
His face is no longer his own.

1076
01:38:02,828 --> 01:38:06,318
What better way to guarantee his
world war than to make the assassin...

1077
01:38:09,386 --> 01:38:10,115
One of the ambassadors.

1078
01:38:11,957 --> 01:38:13,606
That narrows down the
possibility to one of six.

1079
01:38:16,253 --> 01:38:18,439
You and Sim shall find her brother....

1080
01:38:19,667 --> 01:38:20,626
Of this I have no doubt.

1081
01:38:20,933 --> 01:38:21,393
Holmes.

1082
01:38:21,622 --> 01:38:22,658
You know my methods.

1083
01:38:25,152 --> 01:38:26,302
And I know where you'll be.

1084
01:38:27,530 --> 01:38:28,681
No possible solution could be more
congenial to me than this

1085
01:38:32,286 --> 01:38:33,591
By the way, Who taught you how to dance?

1086
01:38:35,508 --> 01:38:36,352
You did, Heh...

1087
01:38:37,119 --> 01:38:39,114
Well, I've done a fine job.

1088
01:38:41,377 --> 01:38:41,952
Be careful.

1089
01:39:18,968 --> 01:39:19,811
Shall we go to work?

1090
01:39:22,381 --> 01:39:25,181
Ladies and Gentlemen, Please
gather for the portrait.

1091
01:39:34,809 --> 01:39:37,340
I'm sorry...
Is this a bad time?

1092
01:39:39,450 --> 01:39:40,563
Never better.

1093
01:39:42,596 --> 01:39:43,363
Would you bring that clock?

1094
01:39:51,072 --> 01:39:52,454
We get to play that game after all.

1095
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:06,416
Here we are...

1096
01:40:13,051 --> 01:40:14,241
Don't want you to catch cold.

1097
01:40:19,956 --> 01:40:20,877
A five minute game?

1098
01:40:22,334 --> 01:40:23,523
If you think you can manage it.

1099
01:40:44,696 --> 01:40:48,687
We both have two bishops, I may be
absent from the room... But my methods are not.

1100
01:40:49,491 --> 01:40:51,141
You can't mean Dr. Watson... Surely?

1101
01:40:53,442 --> 01:40:54,593
So it doesn't seem fair.

1102
01:41:00,193 --> 01:41:00,961
Right ...

1103
01:41:01,229 --> 01:41:02,610
The surgury would've left scars.

1104
01:41:03,952 --> 01:41:06,560
Only four of them have
the hair line to hide them.

1105
01:41:10,896 --> 01:41:13,350
The Ambassador that you've replaced
With Rene, Is he still alive?

1106
01:41:17,569 --> 01:41:19,027
Would you like me to recommend your next move?

1107
01:41:19,985 --> 01:41:21,021
They're all my brother's height,

1108
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:22,633
Right build, But...

1109
01:41:23,477 --> 01:41:24,359
Their eyes,

1110
01:41:25,317 --> 01:41:26,430
Their eyes are wrong.

1111
01:41:27,082 --> 01:41:28,233
Rene has blue eyes.

1112
01:41:30,879 --> 01:41:32,683
He could be wearing glass lenses
To change the color...

1113
01:41:34,600 --> 01:41:36,096
In which case, His eyes will be hurting.

1114
01:41:38,819 --> 01:41:40,009
Rene is left handed.

1115
01:41:41,505 --> 01:41:43,729
Perhaps the assassin would take measures
to ensure

1116
01:41:44,113 --> 01:41:45,532
he doesn't give himself away,

1117
01:41:45,839 --> 01:41:47,565
Like a gambler... Concealing a tell.

1118
01:41:52,360 --> 01:41:54,623
I think... it might be him.

1119
01:41:56,272 --> 01:41:57,154
You think?

1120
01:41:57,615 --> 01:41:58,842
You clock is ticking.

1121
01:41:59,149 --> 01:41:59,993
You have to be sure.

1122
01:42:00,683 --> 01:42:02,333
May I remind you this is blitz chess,

1123
01:42:02,985 --> 01:42:05,056
A single miscalculation will cost you the game.

1124
01:42:08,010 --> 01:42:10,925
If tackle the wrong man to the ground,
I could start a war.

1125
01:42:12,383 --> 01:42:14,684
Maybe it's less obvious... A nervous tic.

1126
01:42:15,605 --> 01:42:16,679
A flutter of anxiety.

1127
01:42:17,216 --> 01:42:19,402
I'd expect everyone has a reason to be nervous tonight.

1128
01:42:25,079 --> 01:42:26,000
I don't know.

1129
01:42:33,441 --> 01:42:35,129
So perhaps it's the opposite...

1130
01:42:35,742 --> 01:42:37,583
A failure to behave naturally.

1131
01:42:38,888 --> 01:42:41,227
An actor so consumed with his performance that..

1132
01:42:41,496 --> 01:42:44,066
The one characteristic he can not accommodate,

1133
01:42:44,718 --> 01:42:45,792
Is spontaneous reaction.

1134
01:43:18,741 --> 01:43:20,620
♪ Speaking french ♪ Brother.

1135
01:43:20,927 --> 01:43:21,618
♪ Speaking french ♪ I beg you.

1136
01:43:30,363 --> 01:43:31,514
♪ Speaking french ♪ Sorry, sister.

1137
01:43:45,246 --> 01:43:46,513
Germany will pay... Mark my word.

1138
01:43:49,197 --> 01:43:50,348
That doesn't boat well does it?

1139
01:43:52,649 --> 01:43:54,376
Seems your bishop was of some benefit.. After all

1140
01:43:57,406 --> 01:43:58,403
The game is still young.

1141
01:43:59,401 --> 01:44:00,666
Actually it's in it adolescence.

1142
01:44:19,384 --> 01:44:20,612
No loose ends.

1143
01:44:26,481 --> 01:44:27,976
What happened....I'm a doctor, A Doctor!

1144
01:44:50,186 --> 01:44:50,761
♪ Speaking french ♪ Brother!

1145
01:44:53,485 --> 01:44:54,635
It's poison.

1146
01:44:55,172 --> 01:44:55,901
Do something!

1147
01:45:01,080 --> 01:45:01,885
Do something!

1148
01:45:20,681 --> 01:45:22,982
I... Think you've just lost
your most valuable piece.

1149
01:45:24,440 --> 01:45:26,626
A winning strategy sometimes
necessitates sacrifice.

1150
01:45:42,851 --> 01:45:43,656
You see ...

1151
01:45:44,539 --> 01:45:49,448
Hidden within the unconscious.....
Is an insatiable desire for conflict.

1152
01:45:52,593 --> 01:45:54,665
So your not... Fighting me,

1153
01:45:55,317 --> 01:45:57,465
So much as you are the human condition.

1154
01:45:59,844 --> 01:46:02,260
All I want to do is to is...
Own the bullets and bandages.

1155
01:46:05,405 --> 01:46:09,318
War... on an industrial scale is inevitable.

1156
01:46:09,702 --> 01:46:12,348
They'll do it themselfs within few years.

1157
01:46:13,461 --> 01:46:15,954
All I have to do...

1158
01:46:16,184 --> 01:46:16,989
Is wait.

1159
01:46:21,516 --> 01:46:22,552
I like Switzerland.

1160
01:46:24,200 --> 01:46:25,927
They respect a man's privacy here.

1161
01:46:27,461 --> 01:46:28,842
Particularly if he has a fortune.

1162
01:46:37,856 --> 01:46:39,505
Bishop takes knight to check.

1163
01:46:40,004 --> 01:46:41,231
The game is over,

1164
01:46:42,650 --> 01:46:44,645
You should get that shoulder looked at.

1165
01:46:44,952 --> 01:46:46,640
About that fortune of yours...

1166
01:46:47,368 --> 01:46:49,709
I believe it's ...Just been substantially reduced

1167
01:46:52,393 --> 01:46:53,621
King to rook two.

1168
01:46:53,928 --> 01:46:55,577
I attended several of your lectures.

1169
01:46:56,152 --> 01:46:58,416
The equations of motion, Which you
will find in my book ...

1170
01:46:58,761 --> 01:47:01,216
The energy that is required to
release these explosions ...

1171
01:47:02,021 --> 01:47:04,591
It was in Oslo, when I first caught a
glimpse of your little notebook....

1172
01:47:04,860 --> 01:47:06,126
Red leather bound, From
Smythson on avon street

1173
01:47:06,433 --> 01:47:11,304
Rook to kings rook 3.. Check!

1174
01:47:20,050 --> 01:47:21,276
Bishop to rook 3.

1175
01:47:21,928 --> 01:47:25,075
It's importance was not fully
aparent to me.. untill I observed your

1176
01:47:25,381 --> 01:47:26,570
for feeding pigeons.

1177
01:47:27,260 --> 01:47:28,335
Then it occurred....

1178
01:47:29,102 --> 01:47:32,247
With an empire so enormous...
Even You ...

1179
01:47:32,592 --> 01:47:33,974
Must keep a record of it somewhere.

1180
01:47:34,472 --> 01:47:35,239
Bishop takes bishop.

1181
01:47:36,236 --> 01:47:37,310
Rook to bishop 4.

1182
01:47:37,656 --> 01:47:39,842
I then only required the notebook itself.

1183
01:47:40,839 --> 01:47:41,798
You didn't make it easy...

1184
01:47:42,489 --> 01:47:45,979
I'd need to endure a
considerable amount of pain.

1185
01:47:49,776 --> 01:47:50,966
Mycroft ...

1186
01:47:53,804 --> 01:47:55,492
Kill her Majesty's Secret Service.

1187
01:47:56,029 --> 01:47:59,635
But notebook would undoubtedly be encoded,
So how then to break the code?

1188
01:48:00,977 --> 01:48:01,974
Rook takes rook.

1189
01:48:02,549 --> 01:48:03,202
Pawn takes rook.

1190
01:48:03,739 --> 01:48:04,660
Bishop to Bishop 7.

1191
01:48:05,005 --> 01:48:06,922
Queen takes knight pawn.

1192
01:48:07,383 --> 01:48:10,336
Does the art of domestic horticulture,
Mean anything to you?

1193
01:48:13,175 --> 01:48:16,013
How could a man as meticulous
as you... Own such a book,

1194
01:48:16,281 --> 01:48:18,161
And yet completely neglect the
Flowers in his own window box?

1195
01:48:18,660 --> 01:48:19,733
Irony bounds.

1196
01:48:25,526 --> 01:48:26,638
Nevermind... It's safe.

1197
01:48:26,869 --> 01:48:28,210
In London.

1198
01:48:29,822 --> 01:48:31,510
Where my colleagues are making good use of it.

1199
01:48:33,159 --> 01:48:36,381
The most formidable criminal mind in
Europe, has just had all his money stolen,

1200
01:48:36,995 --> 01:48:41,023
By perhaps the most inept... inspector
in the history of Scotland Yard.

1201
01:48:41,751 --> 01:48:43,132
Any chance of a cup of tea.

1202
01:48:49,116 --> 01:48:49,653
How much more is there?

1203
01:48:49,845 --> 01:48:51,686
Thats the end of the page 2,

1204
01:48:52,568 --> 01:48:53,796
Page three.

1205
01:48:59,434 --> 01:49:01,352
♪Be careful what you fish for♪

1206
01:49:03,845 --> 01:49:07,374
You'll be making an anonymous donation
to the widows and orphans of war fund.

1207
01:49:09,368 --> 01:49:11,210
Bishop to bishop 8.

1208
01:49:11,709 --> 01:49:12,705
Discover check..

1209
01:49:13,856 --> 01:49:16,043
And incidentally.... Mate!

1210
01:49:18,920 --> 01:49:20,800
I've seemed to've injured my shoulder, Would you mind?

1211
01:49:26,399 --> 01:49:27,857
Will be my pleasure.

1212
01:49:31,155 --> 01:49:33,726
Once we concluded... Our business here,

1213
01:49:35,068 --> 01:49:38,828
It important you know.. I shall endevor to find the most creative of endings

1214
01:49:40,553 --> 01:49:46,000
for the doctor,
And his wife.

1215
01:49:51,102 --> 01:49:54,592
His advantage my injury,

1216
01:49:55,475 --> 01:49:56,779
My advantage, His rage...

1217
01:49:57,967 --> 01:50:00,346
Incoming assault, Feral...
But experienced.

1218
01:50:02,187 --> 01:50:03,913
Use his Momentum, To counter.

1219
01:50:11,930 --> 01:50:15,228
Come now... You really think your..
The only one who can play this game?

1220
01:50:16,187 --> 01:50:19,639
Trap arm... Target weakness...

1221
01:50:20,368 --> 01:50:22,440
Follow with haymaker.

1222
01:50:22,440 --> 01:50:24,357
Ahh..There we find the boxing
champion of Cambridge.

1223
01:50:25,240 --> 01:50:27,273
Competent... But predictable.

1224
01:50:30,380 --> 01:50:32,068
Now... Allow me to reply.

1225
01:50:34,254 --> 01:50:36,863
Also running dry, Adjust strategy

1226
01:50:41,504 --> 01:50:42,654
Wound taking it's toll.

1227
01:50:43,767 --> 01:50:46,682
As I feared...Injury
makes denfense untenable.

1228
01:50:52,512 --> 01:50:53,280
Prognosis ...

1229
01:50:54,315 --> 01:50:55,581
Increasingly negative.

1230
01:51:00,222 --> 01:51:02,946
Let's not waste anymore
Of one anothers time.

1231
01:51:08,431 --> 01:51:10,118
We both know how this ends.

1232
01:51:25,078 --> 01:51:26,727
Conclusion.... Inevitable.

1233
01:51:28,837 --> 01:51:29,681
Unless ...

1234
01:52:36,884 --> 01:52:39,492
A few words may suffice,
To tell the little that remains.

1235
01:52:47,700 --> 01:52:51,536
Any attempt at finding the
Bodies was absolutely hopeless.

1236
01:52:56,906 --> 01:53:01,356
I'm still there... Deep down in that dreadful
culdron of swirling water and seathing foam.

1237
01:53:09,449 --> 01:53:11,175
Alive, For all time...

1238
01:53:13,898 --> 01:53:15,740
The most dangerous criminal...

1239
01:53:18,004 --> 01:53:20,803
And the foremost champion of the law...

1240
01:53:20,803 --> 01:53:21,839
Of their generation.

1241
01:53:27,439 --> 01:53:29,472
I shall ever regard him as the best!

1242
01:53:35,379 --> 01:53:39,215
And the wisest man whom I've ever known.

1243
01:53:39,829 --> 01:53:41,746
John,

1244
01:53:45,121 --> 01:53:47,270
You should probably pack.

1245
01:53:47,270 --> 01:53:49,150
It's half past two, And the carriage
is coming at four.

1246
01:53:51,911 --> 01:53:53,713
It's gonna be a beautiful week in Brighton.

1247
01:53:54,442 --> 01:53:55,478
Yes, It'll be fun.

1248
01:53:56,668 --> 01:53:57,512
I'm looking forward to it.

1249
01:54:00,120 --> 01:54:01,271
You know, I miss him too,

1250
01:54:02,575 --> 01:54:03,840
In my own way.

1251
01:54:10,668 --> 01:54:12,432
He would've wanted us to go.

1252
01:54:14,274 --> 01:54:15,808
He would've wanted to come with us.

1253
01:54:18,033 --> 01:54:19,567
Whens Mrs. Hudson coming for Gladstone?

1254
01:54:20,717 --> 01:54:23,825
Oh... Soon.

1255
01:54:25,512 --> 01:54:26,318
Three o'clock.

1256
01:54:51,596 --> 01:54:52,554
Mary?!

1257
01:54:54,664 --> 01:54:55,777
Who delivered this parcel?

1258
01:54:56,774 --> 01:54:57,579
The Postman.

1259
01:55:00,035 --> 01:55:01,568
The usual chap?, Or....

1260
01:55:02,835 --> 01:55:04,753
Did he look.... Peculiar?

1261
01:55:24,754 --> 02:00:00,054
