1
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,000
Yeow!

2
00:01:48,891 --> 00:01:49,941
Next time amigo.

3
00:01:51,504 --> 00:01:52,778
Finished.

4
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,999
- Where's my girl?
- Fool.

5
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,500
Oh she's cool man. She in there.

6
00:03:56,501 --> 00:03:58,400
She's still fine as hell. So that's it?

7
00:03:58,401 --> 00:03:59,232
Badda Bing. You out of the game.

8
00:03:59,233 --> 00:04:01,168
- Done with the whole trade?
- Yeah.

9
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:03,300
Well that's the whole problem
Bosco. You either keep doing that

10
00:04:03,301 --> 00:04:05,469
or you can do a fifteen year
bid in the Mexican prison

11
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:08,400
with Chito's cousin
and them. Same old shit.

12
00:04:08,401 --> 00:04:11,062
You choose how to flush the
toilet brother. That's right.

13
00:04:11,063 --> 00:04:14,221
Easy way or the hard way

14
00:04:43,006 --> 00:04:46,369
Watch yourself B.A now. You gonna
lose your order of spin here.

15
00:04:52,203 --> 00:04:54,800
What's up girl? You miss me?

16
00:04:54,801 --> 00:04:56,858
'Cause I missed you. I did.

17
00:04:56,859 --> 00:05:01,266
It's been too long baby. Way too long.

18
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:11,063
Heck of a place. Just a
heck of a beautiful place.

19
00:05:11,064 --> 00:05:13,397
Is this a time share? I'd
love to get in on this.

20
00:05:13,398 --> 00:05:16,760
I like this whole Santa Fe
motif you've got going here Rico.

21
00:05:16,761 --> 00:05:20,249
Very Arizona, very Tex Mex. It's good.

22
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:23,930
Maybe we can get the guy in my six to
whip up a couple quesadillas you know.

23
00:05:32,638 --> 00:05:36,055
Americano, Gringo Army intelligence.

24
00:05:36,056 --> 00:05:38,457
- Who's that?
- You man.

25
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:41,400
- Not so intelligent because you're
stuck in some tires man.
- I'm happy. I'm happy.

26
00:05:41,401 --> 00:05:44,116
It doesn't get any better than this right?

27
00:05:44,117 --> 00:05:47,322
I'm living the dream.

28
00:05:47,926 --> 00:05:53,962
You're think you're going to come here...

29
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,734
Well fist of all, she's so hot and uh...

30
00:05:58,735 --> 00:06:00,600
we both hate you so
that's just sort of how...

31
00:06:02,303 --> 00:06:05,172
Good Morning!

32
00:06:05,173 --> 00:06:08,296
Now it's a party! Is that your best shot?

33
00:06:08,297 --> 00:06:10,862
Now it's a party!

34
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,936
Whoa!

35
00:06:54,937 --> 00:06:58,049
- Oh, hell no.
- Slide over... slowly.

36
00:06:58,638 --> 00:07:01,159
You jackin' me? What is this?

37
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,159
Opposite day?

38
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,680
I'm not a thief but if I
don't reach my friend in time,

39
00:07:04,681 --> 00:07:06,172
then he dies.

40
00:07:06,173 --> 00:07:09,669
If you ain't a thief I
guarantee you ain't a killer.

41
00:07:10,605 --> 00:07:14,099
Take your left hand off the wheel,
and your right hand off the shifter.

42
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,145
- Now.
- You ain't gonna shoot me in the head Pops.

43
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,633
You know that ain't happenin'.

44
00:07:22,227 --> 00:07:24,890
What the hell's wrong with you
man? You shoot a total stranger?

45
00:07:24,891 --> 00:07:27,433
I don't even know you fool. Damn!

46
00:07:27,434 --> 00:07:28,370
Oh it will heal I promise.

47
00:07:28,371 --> 00:07:29,200
Here wrap it in this.

48
00:07:29,201 --> 00:07:30,881
I know how to make a tourniquet fool.

49
00:07:30,882 --> 00:07:32,746
I know it hurts but I had
to make a point with you.

50
00:07:32,747 --> 00:07:33,430
That ain't what's pissin' me off.

51
00:07:33,431 --> 00:07:35,361
You shooting my van that's
what's pissing me off man.

52
00:07:35,362 --> 00:07:41,447
What's wrong with you?

53
00:07:41,448 --> 00:07:45,638
- You Army Ranger son?
- Be real careful what you say next Pops.

54
00:07:46,304 --> 00:07:49,903
You be ready to empty that burner if
you start shit talkin' my battalion.

55
00:07:58,957 --> 00:08:04,934
- Colonel Hanibal Smith. 75th Ranger Regiment.
- 4th Battallion. Fort Bean, Georgia.

56
00:08:04,935 --> 00:08:08,143
I know who you are sir.
Corporal B.A. Baracus.

57
00:08:08,144 --> 00:08:12,639
I mean the words out. Dishonorable
discharge For some bullshit.

58
00:08:13,417 --> 00:08:16,589
I don't subscribe to coincidence Corporal.

59
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:19,110
I believe that no matter how
random things might appear,

60
00:08:19,111 --> 00:08:22,109
there still a plan.

61
00:08:27,143 --> 00:08:30,453
Out here in the middle of the Mexican
desert, when I need it the most.

62
00:08:31,015 --> 00:08:32,300
I find a fellow Ranger.

63
00:08:36,003 --> 00:08:38,155
Now I need your help to save another.

64
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:41,881
Your rescue is on the way.

65
00:08:41,882 --> 00:08:44,830
Your rescue is coming? We
fed him to the rotweillers

66
00:08:44,831 --> 00:08:46,303
about an hour ago.

67
00:08:46,304 --> 00:08:48,800
Do you realize that you
actually believe that you got me.

68
00:08:48,801 --> 00:08:51,062
You actually think
you're going to kill me.

69
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:55,061
- Can you drive?
- Better than anybody you've ever seen sir.

70
00:09:02,405 --> 00:09:05,033
In two minutes I'm going
to be having a cold beer.

71
00:09:05,605 --> 00:09:08,900
And you will be on fire.
Take care my friend.

72
00:09:09,737 --> 00:09:12,654
Alpha, Mike...

73
00:09:14,257 --> 00:09:16,919
Foxtrot.

74
00:09:18,194 --> 00:09:20,699
Think about it.

75
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,801
Adios! Mother Fu...

76
00:09:40,767 --> 00:09:42,673
Hannibal.

77
00:09:43,381 --> 00:09:45,976
What are you doing?

78
00:09:51,389 --> 00:09:53,834
Get in.

79
00:09:53,835 --> 00:09:56,296
B.A. Move!

80
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,738
This is bullshit!

81
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:20,953
Please stop, please stop, ow! Please stop.

82
00:10:25,004 --> 00:10:27,286
How's your day going?

83
00:10:27,287 --> 00:10:30,000
This is not gonna taste good.

84
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:43,489
Oh baby, I just threw
up. Let me get some gum.

85
00:10:43,524 --> 00:10:45,932
Did you see that? Did you see Tuco's face?

86
00:10:45,933 --> 00:10:47,700
When you came over that was unbelievable!

87
00:10:47,701 --> 00:10:49,506
- How many times did I say it?
- I mean your timing was perfect.

88
00:10:49,507 --> 00:10:52,094
- How many times did I say it Face?

89
00:10:52,095 --> 00:10:55,690
I told you to take down Tuco alone.

90
00:10:55,691 --> 00:11:01,191
You know what? I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't
have the Hannibal Smith "How To" manual.

91
00:11:01,807 --> 00:11:04,107
- I had to move.
- That move snowballed, Face.

92
00:11:04,108 --> 00:11:05,347
You almost got yourself killed.

93
00:11:05,348 --> 00:11:06,950
You almost got me killed.

94
00:11:06,951 --> 00:11:08,211
You almost got him killed.

95
00:11:15,439 --> 00:11:17,500
Thank you Peck.

96
00:11:17,501 --> 00:11:19,100
Baracus. It's all good.

97
00:11:19,101 --> 00:11:20,520
I was trying to save her.

98
00:11:20,521 --> 00:11:21,601
Save her?

99
00:11:21,602 --> 00:11:22,092
Yeah.

100
00:11:22,093 --> 00:11:23,214
Save her?

101
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:23,700
Yeah.

102
00:11:23,701 --> 00:11:24,350
How?

103
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:26,973
Please do share with us your plan Face.

104
00:11:27,328 --> 00:11:30,984
Okay, I hadn't thought about that yet.

105
00:11:30,985 --> 00:11:32,725
Exactly. I had to.

106
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,845
- Pike.
- Boss.

107
00:11:57,846 --> 00:12:00,835
- Still trampling the same dirt?
- I am unfortunately.

108
00:12:00,836 --> 00:12:03,218
- So what have you got for me?
- I've got a fast bird doin' pizza runs.

109
00:12:03,219 --> 00:12:05,299
- Call sign it Hatchet.
- Hatchet?

110
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:09,266
This is yours. And your pilot, if you
want to call him that is somewhere inside.

111
00:12:09,267 --> 00:12:11,219
- Be careful boss.
- I owe you one.

112
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,592
- Okay, let's not wait to brag though.
- Three years.

113
00:12:13,593 --> 00:12:17,012
How am I going to leave my girl like this?
After all that I had to fight to get her back.

114
00:12:17,013 --> 00:12:19,123
Leave the keys and
we'll come back for her.

115
00:12:31,282 --> 00:12:33,691
Find a treatment room
Corporal. Make it quick.

116
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,111
I'm going to find our pilot.

117
00:12:46,112 --> 00:12:49,576
Oh hey doc. You got a
second for a wounded vet?

118
00:12:51,282 --> 00:12:55,613
Hardly that great of a combat pilot. You ask
him, he thinks he's the best in the world.

119
00:12:55,614 --> 00:12:58,271
But he's a functioning lunatic.

120
00:12:58,272 --> 00:13:02,422
Last week he tried to escape
by jump starting an ambulance.

121
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:06,805
My kind of guy.

122
00:13:06,806 --> 00:13:11,266
- It almost hit your tattoo there.
- Has anybody seen Mr.. Murdock?

123
00:13:11,267 --> 00:13:13,741
The old Ranger tatt.

124
00:13:13,742 --> 00:13:17,301
Would you think I was crazy if
I told you I had one of these?

125
00:13:17,302 --> 00:13:20,800
- Stuck on two eyes man.
- Mr. Murdock?

126
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:21,753
Not while I'm operating nurse.

127
00:13:21,754 --> 00:13:23,543
- Not now.
- Why are you off the ward?

128
00:13:23,544 --> 00:13:26,647
Is that gas? Is that you?

129
00:13:26,682 --> 00:13:28,660
- I smell gas.
- What do you mean ward?

130
00:13:28,661 --> 00:13:31,251
- This man is a patient here.
- Don't listen to her, she's crazy.

131
00:13:31,314 --> 00:13:35,436
- Honestly, I am practicing
doctor at John Hopkins...
- Is he actually working on you?

132
00:13:35,437 --> 00:13:37,876
- You asked him to do a lightning bolt?
- I didn't ask for no lightning bolt.

133
00:13:37,877 --> 00:13:40,779
What's wrong with this fool?

134
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:43,237
- You're on fire man.
- What? What's that?

135
00:13:44,749 --> 00:13:47,063
- You Rangers are awesome.
- Are you crazy?!

136
00:13:54,378 --> 00:13:56,087
Hey! Hey! Come on!

137
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,623
Back off!

138
00:13:58,624 --> 00:14:00,707
Back off! This is a hospital.

139
00:14:01,335 --> 00:14:05,625
- Everybody's met Mr. Murdock.
- Met him? He lit my arm on fire.

140
00:14:06,319 --> 00:14:09,501
- He stitched a lightning bolt in mine man.
- Look at me son.

141
00:14:09,502 --> 00:14:12,925
I'm told you're a hell of a chopper pilot.

142
00:14:12,926 --> 00:14:15,694
- The best sir.
- I'm not getting on a chopper with this nut job.

143
00:14:15,695 --> 00:14:19,023
- That's a good... is he
another one of your projects?
- I'm a real soldier

144
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:22,512
- I'm a Ranger baby!
- I'm worried!

145
00:14:23,007 --> 00:14:26,551
- I'm a Ranger sir.
- That's good enough for me.

146
00:14:26,552 --> 00:14:30,199
You've been released into our
care and reinstated... Captain.

147
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,560
Thank you sir.

148
00:14:31,561 --> 00:14:34,003
Let's get the hell out of here.

149
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:47,370
You gorgeous old rust bucket
you, did you miss your daddy?

150
00:14:47,371 --> 00:14:50,515
Face, what's the most important
part of a well oiled plan?

151
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:53,936
To be one step ahead of the enemy.
Not be running away from him.

152
00:14:53,937 --> 00:14:58,066
- Who say's we're running away?
- What. We're going to go in this
dinosaur with this freak show?

153
00:14:58,067 --> 00:15:00,112
You spin me right round
baby right round...

154
00:15:00,113 --> 00:15:04,743
- Rotors are good sir.
- Who is this guy?

155
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:14,271
- Come on let's go.
- Murdock, get this thing in the air.

156
00:15:14,272 --> 00:15:17,736
Hold on boys! I'm goin' to try
something I saw in a cartoon once.

157
00:15:17,737 --> 00:15:20,121
What are you talking about cartoons
for? Get us the hell out of here!

158
00:15:20,122 --> 00:15:22,788
We got a hot chopper to the six!

159
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:28,048
I'm awesome boys! I'm awesome!

160
00:15:28,049 --> 00:15:31,420
Oh heads up!

161
00:15:38,044 --> 00:15:41,166
- I see you gringo.
- You pancaked my van!

162
00:15:41,266 --> 00:15:44,718
- I'm going to kill you fool.
- You, you can't park there
that's a handicapped zone.

163
00:15:44,719 --> 00:15:47,752
- I knew you were crazy! I knew you were crazy!
- This is a mistake

164
00:15:54,804 --> 00:15:56,681
Fire! Fire! Fire!!

165
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:05,077
Low man's cut!

166
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:11,286
I've never done this before.

167
00:16:11,715 --> 00:16:15,413
- Did you see that?!
- Did you see how he turned the helicopter?

168
00:16:18,682 --> 00:16:23,567
- You got to love some good
air to air combat hey boys?
- Don't look at me look out there!

169
00:16:23,568 --> 00:16:27,307
- He's only got heat seekers left!
- Captain, get us out of here!

170
00:16:27,308 --> 00:16:30,737
Hold on this could get ugly. Here we go.

171
00:16:30,738 --> 00:16:33,762
Come on... come on baby, climb.

172
00:16:40,162 --> 00:16:43,450
- Fire the missiles!
- Whoah! Missiles.

173
00:16:44,274 --> 00:16:47,759
Come on. That's how we deal
with heat seekers chaps!

174
00:16:48,154 --> 00:16:51,587
We go cold.

175
00:16:54,989 --> 00:16:57,758
Face, get him in here!

176
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,224
Oh shit!... Oh shit!!

177
00:16:59,225 --> 00:17:03,271
- Get a hold!!
- Restart... restart...

178
00:17:07,535 --> 00:17:12,062
Close the door! I know you're Airborn
Rangers but that was ridiculous!

179
00:17:12,345 --> 00:17:15,520
You're going to be okay.

180
00:17:16,665 --> 00:17:19,437
Boss, the idea's to kill
Tuco, not the other way around!

181
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:22,349
One step ahead of the
game isn't the plan kid.

182
00:17:22,788 --> 00:17:25,396
Two to three steps ahead.

183
00:17:25,397 --> 00:17:29,609
Beating an enemies move before
it's even made. That's a plan.

184
00:17:29,995 --> 00:17:32,773
Hatchet, Hatchet. Lock on my LC.

185
00:17:32,774 --> 00:17:36,710
General Tuco, you are currently
engaged in unauthorized

186
00:17:36,711 --> 00:17:38,636
warfare on United States
military personnel.

187
00:17:38,637 --> 00:17:41,418
No no no no no no. You engaged me!

188
00:17:41,419 --> 00:17:44,609
Repeat! You are engaged
in unauthorized warfare

189
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:47,941
on United States military personnel.

190
00:17:49,149 --> 00:17:52,056
Over United States air space.

191
00:17:52,466 --> 00:17:55,101
- What?
- Alpha, Mike...

192
00:17:55,102 --> 00:17:58,596
Foxtrot!!

193
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:03,145
In other words... Adios! Mother Fu... !!

194
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:13,249
- Well done Captain.
- That was awesome!

195
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,232
- That wasn't awesome!
- You are a genius!

196
00:18:15,233 --> 00:18:18,459
- I'm never flying again that's it.
- Oh! I never should have doubted you boss!

197
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:21,286
There's a plan in everything kid.

198
00:18:21,287 --> 00:18:25,222
And I love it when a plan comes together.

199
00:18:31,467 --> 00:18:39,677

corrected by chamallow [addic7ed]

200
00:18:50,528 --> 00:18:53,365
Dung batter cooking nothing like it.

201
00:18:56,058 --> 00:18:57,975
Face, you want it napalmed or nuked?

202
00:18:57,976 --> 00:19:01,819
Oh nuke it... nuke it!

203
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,976
Murdock, burn the hell out of that thing.

204
00:19:08,977 --> 00:19:12,679
- Like it was damned.
- Burn the whole place down buddy.

205
00:19:15,925 --> 00:19:19,711
- You want secret sauce?
- No no no no no not antifreeze.

206
00:19:19,712 --> 00:19:22,378
The secret sauce? You
crazy, everybody knows.

207
00:19:22,379 --> 00:19:25,333
No one can do an antifreeze
marinade like you can Murdock.

208
00:19:25,334 --> 00:19:28,280
But, I got a little bells
palsy the last time I ate that.

209
00:19:28,281 --> 00:19:31,397
It's only partial paralysis.
Come on, take it like a man.

210
00:19:31,496 --> 00:19:34,651
Yes sir, having that conversation
right now I've got it well in hand sir.

211
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,865
I don't think you want me to be in
the field partially paralyzed bud.

212
00:19:38,479 --> 00:19:41,151
Visitors...

213
00:19:46,555 --> 00:19:49,045
Yeah...

214
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:55,275
Wow. I'm a little taken
back I'm not going to lie.

215
00:19:55,878 --> 00:19:58,755
- Lieutenant...
- Oh I'm sorry am I supposed
to call you Lieutenant back?

216
00:19:58,756 --> 00:20:02,114
- No, you're supposed to call me Captain.
- Captain... Captain?

217
00:20:02,115 --> 00:20:05,752
- That's right.
- Captain Crust. Look at you.

218
00:20:05,753 --> 00:20:10,268
Wow! So I guess you said no
to the kids, no to the family.

219
00:20:10,269 --> 00:20:14,696
- Just no ladder you can't climb huh?
- No honey, I just said no to you.

220
00:20:16,123 --> 00:20:20,791
Hello my name's Percy
Would you like some pork?

221
00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:23,620
If I broke every bone in your
hand could you still do that?

222
00:20:23,621 --> 00:20:29,274
This is crazy, three years. We haven't seen each other
for three years.. this is what we're going to talk about?

223
00:20:33,328 --> 00:20:36,242
What would you like to discuss?

224
00:20:37,789 --> 00:20:41,528
- Did you take my Steely Dan CD?
- I'm not even going to respond to that.

225
00:20:41,627 --> 00:20:43,440
We listened to it like
nine times in a row,

226
00:20:43,441 --> 00:20:47,340
we were drinking that crappy
Cabernet remember that?

227
00:20:47,341 --> 00:20:49,770
We were doing something
else... what were we doing?

228
00:20:49,771 --> 00:20:51,048
Do you remember what it was we were doing?

229
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:53,991
It was in a bedroom... you don't remember?

230
00:20:53,992 --> 00:20:56,036
The only thing I remember is leaving.

231
00:20:56,037 --> 00:21:04,567
Which is... my fondest memory of you.

232
00:21:04,568 --> 00:21:07,948
You guys are the best.
Stay out of trouble.

233
00:21:07,949 --> 00:21:10,976
- You hear me?
- Take care.

234
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:16,170
Keep that on.

235
00:21:23,727 --> 00:21:26,912
Colonel, my name is Lynch,
I'm with Central Intelligence.

236
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:30,756
I knew a company man named Lynch
back in the first Desert Storm.

237
00:21:30,757 --> 00:21:32,709
Yeah, I come from a long line of Lynches.

238
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:36,900
You ever stop to consider maybe
the reason nobody trusts the CIA

239
00:21:36,901 --> 00:21:39,503
is because nobody knows your real names?

240
00:21:39,504 --> 00:21:41,962
What can I do for you Mr. Lynch?

241
00:21:41,963 --> 00:21:44,410
I need you to help me stop
Saddam's former flunkies

242
00:21:44,411 --> 00:21:47,221
from stealing over a billion
dollars in the next thirty hours.

243
00:21:47,795 --> 00:21:51,014
Now the only mint outside of the
US capable of printing our money,

244
00:21:51,015 --> 00:21:54,502
belonged to the Shah of Iran. During
the Iran/Iraq war, it went missing.

245
00:21:54,503 --> 00:21:56,365
Rumor was Saddam had stolen it.

246
00:21:56,366 --> 00:21:58,351
And we stole it back during Desert Storm.

247
00:21:58,352 --> 00:22:01,916
Well we didn't get the engravement plates.

248
00:22:01,917 --> 00:22:05,827
That didn't matter. They would have had to
rebuild the mint just to print those bills.

249
00:22:05,895 --> 00:22:10,102
Well sir, that's happening as we speak.

250
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:16,008
Thadine thugs have seized what's left

251
00:22:16,009 --> 00:22:18,984
of the Iraqi national mint to
run off billions of dollars,

252
00:22:18,985 --> 00:22:20,680
in unbacked American currency.

253
00:22:20,681 --> 00:22:23,924
How are they planning on moving the plates
and a billion dollars out of Baghdad?

254
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:28,087
Armored convoy, manned with
former... Iraqi spec ops.

255
00:22:28,088 --> 00:22:31,500
- Yeah.
- High speed shoot to kill types.

256
00:22:31,535 --> 00:22:34,862
So how do you plan on stopping them?

257
00:22:38,638 --> 00:22:42,236
Listen... there's some rumors
about some top secret plates

258
00:22:42,237 --> 00:22:44,696
being smuggled out of the
city by Saddam loyalists.

259
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,462
Do you know anything about this?

260
00:22:46,463 --> 00:22:51,108
Seriously, if you're going to make a play
for these plates I'm waving you off right now.

261
00:22:51,109 --> 00:22:53,783
Because it's my
responsibility and it's my ass.

262
00:22:53,784 --> 00:22:58,902
I'm serious... Face? I'm
court marshalling you.

263
00:22:58,903 --> 00:22:59,925
Ooh... okay.

264
00:22:59,926 --> 00:23:02,957
Hey! Get the memo.

265
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:05,002
Tell your beloved Colonel Smith.

266
00:23:05,003 --> 00:23:09,360
And stay the hell out of Baghdad.

267
00:23:09,361 --> 00:23:12,630
You know... you never came back. I
thought you were going to come back.

268
00:23:12,631 --> 00:23:15,015
Well, this is me... coming back.

269
00:23:22,896 --> 00:23:24,650
You think those clowns
could really pull this off?

270
00:23:24,651 --> 00:23:27,120
Listen, listen I would never tell him this

271
00:23:27,121 --> 00:23:30,013
but they are the best damn
section unit in the four branches.

272
00:23:30,014 --> 00:23:32,429
- And they specialize in the ridiculous.
- Diablo!

273
00:23:32,991 --> 00:23:37,207
I'm getting the rest of them. Do
not let them out of your sight!

274
00:23:39,972 --> 00:23:43,310
- Doesn't Diablo mean devil?
- Yeah man!

275
00:23:44,031 --> 00:23:46,258
God damn it Hannibal,
what do you want me to do?

276
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:49,751
If this were my operation and you
wanted it, you'd have the mission.

277
00:23:49,752 --> 00:23:53,183
You let Black Forest deploy on this
and it's an international incident

278
00:23:53,184 --> 00:23:57,586
I promise you. They're not soldiers...
They're frat boys with trigger fingers.

279
00:23:57,621 --> 00:24:01,743
- Who's running the ground team?
- Brad Pike.

280
00:24:02,973 --> 00:24:08,140
Pike? He's a thug... he's
a cartoon character, come on!

281
00:24:08,141 --> 00:24:11,560
Hannibal we have been
ordered. Ordered, mind you,

282
00:24:11,561 --> 00:24:15,222
to stay out of Baghdad.
Cut, dried, the end.

283
00:24:15,223 --> 00:24:19,308
General, we should find him a
little wiggle room. Don't you think?

284
00:24:19,309 --> 00:24:23,592
You know, I knew another Lynch CIA stooge.

285
00:24:23,593 --> 00:24:26,256
Stationed in Laos '68.

286
00:24:26,274 --> 00:24:27,660
No relation.

287
00:24:27,661 --> 00:24:32,078
Are you sure? Because
you remind me of him.

288
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:34,777
I'm due in Kabul in a few hours.

289
00:24:34,778 --> 00:24:37,919
Back here in 48 assuming
we're green and go.

290
00:24:38,087 --> 00:24:39,792
Notify me otherwise.

291
00:24:39,793 --> 00:24:42,458
He's wearing body armour in the HQ.

292
00:24:43,011 --> 00:24:47,809
And that should tell you everything
you need to know about the CIA.

293
00:24:56,801 --> 00:25:00,134
I want you to know this is not
about you losing a step Hal.

294
00:25:00,135 --> 00:25:04,937
Hey, hey! I'm ten times the
man I was when you met me.

295
00:25:04,938 --> 00:25:07,276
- And twice as fast.
- Uh huh.

296
00:25:07,277 --> 00:25:12,089
Russ, the boys and I can get
this done minus the bloodshed.

297
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:14,166
Those plates can do all kinds of damage.

298
00:25:14,167 --> 00:25:18,319
- Don't make me beg.
- I'd hate to se you beg Hal.

299
00:25:20,046 --> 00:25:23,620
You've been my friend for a long time.

300
00:25:23,871 --> 00:25:27,025
More importantly you and those boys have

301
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:30,181
possibly been the most
valuable military asset

302
00:25:30,182 --> 00:25:33,731
I have ever had at my disposal.

303
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:36,860
Now... you asked me not to make you beg.

304
00:25:37,475 --> 00:25:39,000
Right now I'm begging you.

305
00:25:39,001 --> 00:25:41,000
Hannibal... please...

306
00:25:41,001 --> 00:25:44,000
Let this one go.

307
00:25:46,326 --> 00:25:50,747
Listen BA, we're extending
our stay a little bit.

308
00:25:50,748 --> 00:25:51,640
We're going back into Baghdad.

309
00:25:51,641 --> 00:25:53,975
I thought we was ordered
to stay out of Baghdad?

310
00:25:53,976 --> 00:25:56,557
- That's true but I'm...
- Smith.

311
00:25:56,558 --> 00:25:58,204
Pike.

312
00:25:58,205 --> 00:26:01,761
I understand you and your grunts are
now stealing my gigs. I don't like that.

313
00:26:01,762 --> 00:26:06,084
I figured you Black Forest guys would
be busy installing a dictatorship or

314
00:26:06,085 --> 00:26:08,915
overthrowing a democracy somewhere.

315
00:26:08,977 --> 00:26:13,659
It's still the weekend yet.
That's nine to five stuff... Pops.

316
00:26:13,762 --> 00:26:17,243
Look at you clowns you're not soldiers.

317
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:21,013
You're assassins in polo shirts.

318
00:26:21,014 --> 00:26:25,092
We make in a week what
you guys make in a year.

319
00:26:25,093 --> 00:26:27,000
Cash don't buy guts kid...

320
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,117
or brains.

321
00:26:29,118 --> 00:26:32,635
And you're short on both.

322
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:37,483
This is Morrison's base. Bug out of my op.

323
00:26:37,573 --> 00:26:42,275
I'm telling you, there's
a reason she came back.

324
00:26:42,276 --> 00:26:44,155
Face, I told you forget about her.

325
00:26:44,156 --> 00:26:47,487
- The level of ambition on this woman...
- I ain't stepping foot in any
type of aircraft Hannibal.

326
00:26:47,488 --> 00:26:50,699
No gliders... paper planes ultralights.

327
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,819
- Are you ever going to let me live that down?
- No

328
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,401
Mexico was a long time
ago and I saved your life.

329
00:26:55,402 --> 00:26:57,428
How about thanking me for not
whooping your ass at that hospital.

330
00:26:57,429 --> 00:26:58,970
I was an Airborn Ranger until I met you.

331
00:26:58,971 --> 00:27:01,862
- And you chickened out just like...
- 263 jumps.

332
00:27:01,863 --> 00:27:05,001
- Just a thank you would have been nice.
- And one helicopter ride with you screws it up.

333
00:27:05,002 --> 00:27:09,068
- Airborn Ranger with a
fear of flying... like a punk.
- B.A., for the last time.

334
00:27:09,168 --> 00:27:12,113
Nobody leaves the truck
once we take it over.

335
00:27:12,114 --> 00:27:14,566
Okay?

336
00:27:14,567 --> 00:27:17,606
Staging, movement, action plan.

337
00:27:18,185 --> 00:27:20,666
And here's a nice read for you.

338
00:27:20,667 --> 00:27:25,382
Aw, hell yeah Hannibal,
this is it right here.

339
00:27:25,383 --> 00:27:28,335
This is bat shit insane.

340
00:27:28,576 --> 00:27:32,416
- It's perfect.
- I don't man... this is beyond nuts boss.

341
00:27:36,051 --> 00:27:38,000
It gets better.

342
00:27:39,273 --> 00:27:42,854
BA, you'll need a piece of
contoured metal to make a skid plate.

343
00:27:42,855 --> 00:27:46,090
- Let's go fool.
- Murdock, we'll need a car battery too.

344
00:27:46,091 --> 00:27:49,422
See if the boys at Black
Forest can help us out.

345
00:27:49,423 --> 00:27:51,584
Press credentials... we need them.

346
00:27:51,585 --> 00:27:54,093
Hit the media tent.
See what's lying around.

347
00:27:54,094 --> 00:27:58,168
Oy, my friend. I see you've put the
South African microphone at the bottom.

348
00:27:58,169 --> 00:28:00,187
You can't always put the CNN on top.

349
00:28:00,188 --> 00:28:03,444
There's two mike stands you
gotta make sure there's someone...

350
00:28:05,226 --> 00:28:09,740
Murdock, we need a news camera.

351
00:28:09,741 --> 00:28:12,046
See what you can do.

352
00:28:13,716 --> 00:28:16,375
Hi sorry, uh... sorry
oh... sorry... sorry.

353
00:28:16,376 --> 00:28:20,284
Hello I'm... I'm in love with you.

354
00:28:20,566 --> 00:28:23,070
Listen.. we're doing preliminary
cov... of what are we talking about?

355
00:28:23,071 --> 00:28:25,298
the pullout!

356
00:28:25,299 --> 00:28:28,008
We're going to need airbags. Lots of them.

357
00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:30,419
- Le Monde.

358
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:33,166
Oh, you're French...

359
00:28:36,711 --> 00:28:40,591
- Hello this is General Parker I need...
- It's for you.

360
00:28:41,131 --> 00:28:44,059
You can call an air strike on yourself.

361
00:28:44,411 --> 00:28:47,625
- We're good mate... meet you back there.
- No, okay I think we need to get back to the...

362
00:28:47,626 --> 00:28:51,041
I think you need to understand
what I'm telling you right now.

363
00:28:51,042 --> 00:28:52,529
BA we're going to need a magnet.

364
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,055
Yeah!!

365
00:28:54,056 --> 00:28:58,838
A powerful one.

366
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:01,738
Have you ever seen Blue Man group?

367
00:29:02,066 --> 00:29:05,185
I'll pick up the rest.

368
00:29:13,849 --> 00:29:16,382
I'm just going to go for it.

369
00:29:18,413 --> 00:29:20,327
Ooh la la.

370
00:29:20,328 --> 00:29:22,764
What would you give for one chance,

371
00:29:22,765 --> 00:29:26,241
to come back here and tell our enemies,

372
00:29:26,242 --> 00:29:30,120
that they may take our lives
but they'll never take...

373
00:29:30,121 --> 00:29:40,277
our freedom!!

374
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:43,212
Ready to go downtown? Good luck.

375
00:29:44,367 --> 00:29:46,647
Give 'em hell.

376
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:54,263
General Morrison...
where is Hannibal Smith?

377
00:29:54,363 --> 00:29:57,549
They go mobile in three hours.

378
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:58,694
The plates...

379
00:29:58,696 --> 00:30:03,541
and over a billion dollars will be
loaded in the back of a semi at the mint.

380
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:08,557
They're over land for exactly 4.6
miles before they reach the bridge.

381
00:30:12,057 --> 00:30:16,627
That's our window and it closes fast.

382
00:30:18,806 --> 00:30:22,437
These guys will go weapons hot
at the first whisper of trouble.

383
00:30:26,936 --> 00:30:31,260
Face, your point of
entry is under the hotel.

384
00:30:31,727 --> 00:30:34,740
It will be packed with foreign
press and private security.

385
00:30:52,071 --> 00:30:55,912
BA, you're in this
alleyway with a stopwatch.

386
00:30:56,012 --> 00:31:00,455
- Make sure the bike is V twins or better.
- I got something a whole lot better.

387
00:31:01,456 --> 00:31:04,264
What about me boss man?

388
00:31:05,394 --> 00:31:08,667
I had a little helicopter here someplace.

389
00:31:08,668 --> 00:31:11,946
You got some battle
rolls... some mid air stalls?

390
00:31:11,947 --> 00:31:16,123
I'm looking for my next
near death experience.

391
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:19,636
Only on support this time Captain. But
I'll get you in on th next one... I promise.

392
00:31:19,736 --> 00:31:25,529
BA, I need you to pop
that clutch at 06:30.

393
00:31:27,824 --> 00:31:31,944
Is that me? Oh no I forgot I'm
in an Iraqi sewer. Thanks boss!

394
00:31:36,392 --> 00:31:40,161
Timing... is everything Face.

395
00:31:40,643 --> 00:31:43,882
This is all about the bulls-eyes.

396
00:31:49,729 --> 00:31:52,184
Why not?

397
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:56,971
Under the semi, you will take
out the truck directly behind you.

398
00:32:08,936 --> 00:32:13,621
Now these guys are going to be on to you
Face. BA that's your cue for throttle.

399
00:32:13,656 --> 00:32:16,000
Be sure to look both ways before crossing.

400
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:18,400
And have a nice full tank of gas.

401
00:32:29,209 --> 00:32:32,346
There will be multiple
hostiles on board BA.

402
00:32:33,899 --> 00:32:37,282
Escort them from the premises.

403
00:32:53,659 --> 00:32:58,131
If any stragglers sneak up behind
don't worry, I got your back.

404
00:33:09,678 --> 00:33:11,651
Got ya kid!

405
00:33:12,837 --> 00:33:17,066
That's all fine in theory but I still
don't see how we get out of Baghdad.

406
00:33:17,067 --> 00:33:18,375
I do.

407
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,569
- BA! Hang a right.
- All right, hang on!

408
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:31,772
- Watch out, watch out.
- Heads down.

409
00:33:33,085 --> 00:33:35,891
Nice one BA!

410
00:33:36,365 --> 00:33:37,530
Face, get the airbags!

411
00:33:37,531 --> 00:33:42,363
Got to make sure this thing
stays locked for later.

412
00:33:42,364 --> 00:33:43,400
Beautiful.

413
00:33:43,401 --> 00:33:46,608
One... two... three.

414
00:33:50,609 --> 00:33:54,326
Hey boss! The airbags do
deploy on impact right?

415
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:58,525
BA get in the container!

416
00:33:59,468 --> 00:34:02,303
Contact rear!

417
00:34:16,501 --> 00:34:21,390
Okay this is the part of
the plan I don't trust.

418
00:34:21,391 --> 00:34:23,145
Don't worry Face, the ropes will hold.

419
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:26,979
If I was worried I'd be nailing
myself to the container right now.

420
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,629
Hang on boys!

421
00:34:46,977 --> 00:34:50,990
Come on I smoked you! Did
you boys see that down there?

422
00:34:51,138 --> 00:34:54,836
- Colonel!
- What is that fool doing here? Don't lock me in here.

423
00:34:54,936 --> 00:34:59,219
Hey boss, you ever play that game at the fun fair
where you try to pick up a stuffed animal with the claw?

424
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:03,683
- This is a lot like that.
- Taking!

425
00:35:04,228 --> 00:35:08,745
Did you lock this? !
You locked me in here!

426
00:35:08,845 --> 00:35:14,210
- Would you... are you listening?!
- I got you.

427
00:35:16,462 --> 00:35:18,709
- I'm going to kill you fool!
- Boss... is that Bosco?

428
00:35:18,751 --> 00:35:23,835
- Get me out of here!!!
- Oh that's not good... he is not happy.

429
00:35:45,125 --> 00:35:48,668
- Boss... we are in the net.
- Copy that.

430
00:35:48,768 --> 00:35:52,709
I will be there in five I've got
a big bottle of blue label waiting.

431
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:56,837
A bottle? Make it a
case. See you in a few.

432
00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:00,753
- Who's going to let him out?
- You!

433
00:36:00,788 --> 00:36:04,233
What you don't realize is...
now I got to kill all y'all.

434
00:36:04,234 --> 00:36:06,714
I'll kill all y'all!!!

435
00:36:06,715 --> 00:36:10,621
Boss, maybe... let me try something.

436
00:36:10,721 --> 00:36:11,460
Go for it.

437
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:14,271
Is it weird that I'm more
scared now than what we just did?

438
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:17,992
- Bosco... it's Murdock.
- Murdock open this door!!

439
00:36:18,292 --> 00:36:21,296
I'll make you some of that coconut
curry tapenade that you love.

440
00:36:21,396 --> 00:36:23,763
Ooh that might work.

441
00:36:24,026 --> 00:36:27,164
- With toast points?
- Well hell yeah with toast points.

442
00:36:27,248 --> 00:36:29,999
You thought we were going to
have that with plain old chips?

443
00:36:31,008 --> 00:36:33,426
- You tricked me!
- There he is...

444
00:36:33,461 --> 00:36:35,810
- Come on!
- Get away from me man!

445
00:36:35,845 --> 00:36:40,052
My arteries just about... you should
know better! You know I hate flying.

446
00:36:40,601 --> 00:36:44,097
I'm sweating! I stink! And I
can't spend none of that money.

447
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,780
- Money can't buy happiness.
- Damn man!

448
00:36:46,394 --> 00:36:49,404
Hey Murdock, you cook it tonight!
You better get your apron on.

449
00:36:52,613 --> 00:36:54,537
I love it when a plan comes together.

450
00:37:00,629 --> 00:37:04,152
- Hannibal, who was that?!
- Was that the General?!

451
00:37:04,676 --> 00:37:08,156
General! Ross?!

452
00:37:09,534 --> 00:37:12,340
My God.

453
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,260
Pike.

454
00:37:17,261 --> 00:37:20,464
Contact rear!

455
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,741
After conferring, we've decided to demote
you to the rank of first lieutenant.

456
00:38:14,502 --> 00:38:18,858
Lieutenant Sosa, it's nothing
personal but you lost those plates.

457
00:38:18,893 --> 00:38:22,545
- Those were your responsibility.
- Consider yourself lucky, others are going to

458
00:38:22,546 --> 00:38:27,553
- prison over this.
- Good day Director MacReady.
Lieutenant, you're dismissed.

459
00:38:27,689 --> 00:38:32,990
Colonel Smith, this court has been unable to
recover any direct order from General Morrison,

460
00:38:32,991 --> 00:38:37,252
for you to conduct the mission
for which you're being tried.

461
00:38:37,253 --> 00:38:43,196
Your Honor this was a covert operation
and no official orders were given.

462
00:38:44,022 --> 00:38:49,203
So the one individual who could verify the legitimacy
of this operation is deceased. Is that correct Colonel?

463
00:38:49,303 --> 00:38:51,189
No Your Honor, not deceased.

464
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:56,210
- General Morrison was murdered.
- Colonel, I've been on a long time

465
00:38:56,211 --> 00:38:59,311
seen units like yours they're outlaws

466
00:38:59,312 --> 00:39:04,942
units like that pose a direct threat to
the fabric and fundamentals of our military.

467
00:39:06,297 --> 00:39:09,836
Your Honor, why hasn't Black
Forest been brought to trial?

468
00:39:09,963 --> 00:39:15,155
Black Forrest and its personnel are
not subject to military jurisdiction.

469
00:39:16,054 --> 00:39:18,824
Where's the plan boss?
Where's the escape package?

470
00:39:18,986 --> 00:39:22,555
This mission isn't over Lieutenant.

471
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:26,239
I'll clear our names. We
find Pike and the plates.

472
00:39:27,256 --> 00:39:29,889
No matter what.

473
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:33,256
Your Honors, these men were
acting under my command.

474
00:39:33,257 --> 00:39:35,766
Any judgment should be levied
against me and me alone.

475
00:39:35,767 --> 00:39:39,998
Absolutely not sir, we were all
participating in this operation willingly.

476
00:39:40,098 --> 00:39:42,746
- I don't want to be tried separately.
- I refuse to be tried separately sir.

477
00:39:42,765 --> 00:39:45,296
In accordance with the uniform
code of military justice

478
00:39:45,297 --> 00:39:48,815
this court is rendering guilty verdicts
for each member of this Alpha unit.

479
00:39:48,816 --> 00:39:49,792
Or 'A-Team'.

480
00:39:49,793 --> 00:39:54,379
And mandating incarceration in
separate maximum security facilities

481
00:39:54,414 --> 00:39:59,575
for a period of up to ten years. You
are all hereby stripped of formal rank.

482
00:39:59,576 --> 00:40:02,412
and dishonorably discharged.

483
00:40:05,413 --> 00:40:09,006
- This is bullshit man.
- This session is adjourned.

484
00:40:11,912 --> 00:40:19,864
- At Black Forest what... ?
- You disgraced me.

485
00:40:21,056 --> 00:40:23,610
- Absolute disgrace!
- Are you happy?

486
00:40:24,325 --> 00:40:28,760
- Colonel, control your men!
- Get your hands off me!

487
00:40:48,838 --> 00:40:52,311
Well hello Mr. Lynch. Long time.

488
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:57,008
You look very relaxed Lynch.
A lot of cameras in here.

489
00:40:57,379 --> 00:41:02,712
Yeah there are. Yeah well, they seem to be
having some technical issues at the moment.

490
00:41:02,812 --> 00:41:07,478
I may not show up until playback.
Hannibal, can I call you Hannibal?

491
00:41:08,042 --> 00:41:10,439
Can't call you Colonel any more.

492
00:41:10,775 --> 00:41:14,754
Six months been waiting for you.

493
00:41:14,755 --> 00:41:19,815
Bust out of here and round up the rest of the
Backstreet Boys and lead me to those plates.

494
00:41:20,956 --> 00:41:22,813
Six months and not a peep.

495
00:41:23,213 --> 00:41:26,828
Everybody thought you and your
team were working with Pike.

496
00:41:27,134 --> 00:41:32,420
Everybody except you.
Pike murdered Morrison.

497
00:41:32,421 --> 00:41:36,089
Set me and my boys up
and stole those plates.

498
00:41:39,528 --> 00:41:43,156
And I know where he is.

499
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:46,779
Nobody knows where he is.

500
00:41:50,371 --> 00:41:55,248
There's a single image of him. Taken
about a month ago somewhere in Europe.

501
00:41:55,257 --> 00:41:58,293
We think it's a grab from the CCTV camera.

502
00:42:00,315 --> 00:42:03,234
Frankfurt, Germany.

503
00:42:04,399 --> 00:42:08,551
- How did you get that in here?
- Time, Lynch.

504
00:42:08,617 --> 00:42:11,867
Give me a minute, I'm good.
If I've got an hour, I'm great.

505
00:42:12,316 --> 00:42:15,725
You give me six months, I'm unbeatable.

506
00:42:15,726 --> 00:42:18,605
I know Pike, who's the Arab?

507
00:42:18,606 --> 00:42:20,360
We don't know.

508
00:42:20,361 --> 00:42:23,482
We think he's the 'Deep Dark'.
Hidden hand in this whole thing.

509
00:42:23,506 --> 00:42:26,457
Maybe a broker, maybe a buyer.

510
00:42:26,458 --> 00:42:31,390
Lynch, we have common enemies
and you have limited choices.

511
00:42:31,391 --> 00:42:33,829
My team is still your best shot
at getting those plates back.

512
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:37,049
- I wouldn't be so sure?
- Then why did you make
the long drive out here?

513
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:40,822
You and your boys at Langley want
your own private printing press.

514
00:42:40,857 --> 00:42:43,716
That's about as deep
as your patriotism goes.

515
00:42:44,286 --> 00:42:46,436
So what would you need from me?

516
00:42:46,437 --> 00:42:49,427
I swore to my team that
I would clear our names.

517
00:42:49,428 --> 00:42:52,039
You of all people must
understand the value of a name.

518
00:42:57,129 --> 00:43:04,110
Listen, I want full reinstatement and
clean records for myself, and my team.

519
00:43:04,157 --> 00:43:08,601
I can't get you out here.
Not legally at least.

520
00:43:09,944 --> 00:43:13,225
This is something the boys
in Langley do very very well.

521
00:43:13,226 --> 00:43:17,000
Make sure the dosage is right.

522
00:43:17,001 --> 00:43:20,185
And when I say right I mean perfect.

523
00:43:27,368 --> 00:43:30,875
Cuban... what a shame.

524
00:44:18,485 --> 00:44:25,293
You are not... permitted...
in... my... dojo!!!

525
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:31,970
So, Satan walks into this bar.

526
00:44:33,637 --> 00:44:37,387
Wait a minute what's this?
A lap pool? A dry steam room?

527
00:44:37,388 --> 00:44:39,911
Yeah. It will go a long way with the boys.

528
00:44:40,018 --> 00:44:42,766
How in the hell do you pull this off?

529
00:44:42,801 --> 00:44:47,606
- It's not who you know Bob,
it's how you know them.
- Oh, did your boy get back from Afghanistan?

530
00:44:47,676 --> 00:44:51,600
Yeah thanks for getting him home.
His mother and I are real grateful.

531
00:44:51,601 --> 00:44:53,381
- Captain...
- Hey

532
00:44:53,382 --> 00:44:56,974
You left something on the bed.

533
00:44:58,871 --> 00:45:01,974
- You could have hid those.
- Why would I want to do that?

534
00:45:02,265 --> 00:45:04,161
Drive me crazy. I'll see you at eight.

535
00:45:04,162 --> 00:45:08,253
- Hey LT thanks for the boots.
- Ah come on, it's my pleasure baby.

536
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:16,429
Smith has escaped Lieutenant.

537
00:45:16,737 --> 00:45:18,533
Let me go after him.

538
00:45:18,534 --> 00:45:21,527
Smith and his team are working
with Brock Pike and Black Forest.

539
00:45:21,528 --> 00:45:24,067
I can get those plates back for you sir.

540
00:45:24,623 --> 00:45:27,027
You know I can.

541
00:45:27,028 --> 00:45:29,402
Holler what? Holler who?

542
00:45:35,576 --> 00:45:39,273
Hey, hey! Let me out!

543
00:45:39,274 --> 00:45:41,600
Hey, hey hey!!!

544
00:45:53,924 --> 00:45:57,497
You are... really tanned.

545
00:45:59,129 --> 00:46:02,130
Seal that up nobody goes in there.

546
00:46:02,131 --> 00:46:06,414
Log in pages from day in
question have been removed.

547
00:46:06,415 --> 00:46:08,710
- Why does that not surprise me?
- Torn out.

548
00:46:09,411 --> 00:46:12,440
The cigar was in the spine of that book.

549
00:46:12,705 --> 00:46:14,710
- Wow, subtle.
- Now, get this.

550
00:46:14,711 --> 00:46:18,004
Now, this is surveillance from
all around the prisoner right?

551
00:46:18,005 --> 00:46:21,389
Now what you're watching is a signal
jammer this is high tech stuff.

552
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:25,193
It sends a jamming signal in front of every
camera every time we might get a glimpse of him.

553
00:46:25,194 --> 00:46:27,689
We see nothing. Nobody knows who he is.

554
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:31,330
Which begs a bigger question.
Did the CIA visit Smith in prison?

555
00:46:31,331 --> 00:46:34,539
it sounds kind of crazy but
I think the CIA broke him out.

556
00:46:34,839 --> 00:46:38,449
- Who put us on?
- The same guy who put us on in Baghdad.

557
00:46:38,615 --> 00:46:40,798
Lynch, CIA.

558
00:46:40,897 --> 00:46:43,805
What are we talking about?
Clean records? Reinstatements?

559
00:46:44,205 --> 00:46:48,409
- All of the above.
- What about Pike? And the plates.

560
00:46:48,909 --> 00:46:51,596
Payback.

561
00:46:51,704 --> 00:46:56,606
- I take it you didn't get religion inside.
- No, I got revenge.

562
00:46:56,995 --> 00:46:59,349
Good.

563
00:47:00,588 --> 00:47:03,282
I know a couple guys that
will feel the exact same way.

564
00:47:03,386 --> 00:47:05,983
I'm counting on it.

565
00:47:29,528 --> 00:47:34,725
Emergency exit now... Hannibal.

566
00:47:46,215 --> 00:47:49,125
Baracus! Don't do it!

567
00:47:49,295 --> 00:47:52,028
Where's he going?

568
00:47:52,789 --> 00:47:55,452
Baracus, god damn it!

569
00:48:01,227 --> 00:48:03,991
- Sosa.
- Baracus and Peck are already gone.

570
00:48:04,266 --> 00:48:08,336
- What?
- Murdock is the only one left, and he's in Germany.

571
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,730
How did you know that once that door was
extracted that it would take his weight.

572
00:48:21,731 --> 00:48:25,323
- I just did, he's you know he's what 225... 230lbs?
- 230 yeah.

573
00:48:25,724 --> 00:48:27,361
Do you remember the gag we did in...

574
00:48:27,362 --> 00:48:29,857
- Venezuela seven years ago?
- Venezuela yeah, yeah yes.

575
00:48:30,357 --> 00:48:32,404
But that was a midget.

576
00:48:34,781 --> 00:48:36,245
- There he is.
- He's back.

577
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:39,639
- It's good to be back man.
- My man.

578
00:48:39,739 --> 00:48:41,609
- It's good to see you brother.
- You too bro, you too.

579
00:48:42,335 --> 00:48:44,131
- Thanks man.
- You're welcome.

580
00:48:44,132 --> 00:48:46,010
Good to see you guys.

581
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:52,217
- What?
- Where's the mohawk?

582
00:48:52,252 --> 00:48:54,711
What? You don't like my new do man?

583
00:48:54,712 --> 00:48:57,905
Do I like it? We got you
the clippers, I thought...

584
00:48:57,906 --> 00:49:00,371
Yeah I used them.

585
00:49:02,697 --> 00:49:04,772
Hey, what's up big guy?

586
00:49:06,269 --> 00:49:08,669
Come on, you can speak to us.

587
00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:11,336
You guy's, hmm...

588
00:49:12,125 --> 00:49:15,067
I can't kill anybody.

589
00:49:16,671 --> 00:49:19,908
- What do you mean?
- I've taken a vow.

590
00:49:20,721 --> 00:49:25,795
- Vow?
- I'll still do things with you guys. You know that.

591
00:49:26,583 --> 00:49:31,322
But I just can't kill man.
Old habits may die hard but,

592
00:49:32,683 --> 00:49:34,622
they still gotta die.

593
00:49:34,656 --> 00:49:38,648
When I was a kid, all you'd
hear in the 'hood was...

594
00:49:38,749 --> 00:49:43,141
Bosco's a bad ass out collecting scalps.

595
00:49:43,832 --> 00:49:46,726
That's where the mohawk came from.

596
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:51,288
- I was always at war.
- That's what warriors are for.

597
00:49:51,388 --> 00:49:53,903
I don't know man. I don't miss that life.

598
00:49:53,904 --> 00:49:56,680
I'll help you get Murdock right
there ain't a problem, but...

599
00:49:58,367 --> 00:50:01,254
- I can't kill.
- Even Pike?

600
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:06,920
- Even if killing him would clear your name?
- My conscience is the only thing I need.

601
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:10,893
Now, where is that crazy ass fool?

602
00:50:21,618 --> 00:50:25,804
Hey Murdock, you got a
package from Annabelle Smith.

603
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:35,195
Wow it's so real.

604
00:50:37,181 --> 00:50:40,973
I now knight you... sir you have to put
your head down. Stand up and do it again.

605
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:43,880
When you kneel put your
head down straight away.

606
00:50:43,881 --> 00:50:45,000
Looking me in the eye is
disrespectful you understand?

607
00:50:45,661 --> 00:50:47,260
Movie, movie...

608
00:50:47,261 --> 00:50:48,600
You're looking me in the
eye now, that's wrong.

609
00:50:48,601 --> 00:50:56,558
Movie, movie, movie. Movie, movie, movie.

610
00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:02,558
Movie shit.

611
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:06,466
- Excuse me, can I help you with something?
- Yes, Captain Murdock. Where is he?

612
00:51:06,704 --> 00:51:08,270
- Right through there.
- Thank you.

613
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:11,172
El Diablo...

614
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:14,583
Okay, , settle down. No
talking during the movie.

615
00:51:26,584 --> 00:51:30,667
Captain Murdock. You
remember me? From Baghdad.

616
00:51:37,856 --> 00:51:41,351
- Okay this is pointless, this guy is fried.
- Yeah, there's a reason why he's here.

617
00:51:41,352 --> 00:51:44,700
And his entire team
has escaped except, him.

618
00:51:44,701 --> 00:51:46,367
- Movie!

619
00:51:46,368 --> 00:51:50,930
Take a look around anyway
just to make sure he's alone.

620
00:52:18,624 --> 00:52:22,087
- Oh Captain! Your chariot awaits.
- Sorry boys, gotta run.

621
00:52:22,088 --> 00:52:24,264
Can't finish the movie.
Do let me know how it ends.

622
00:52:24,265 --> 00:52:27,231
Charisa where are you
hiding? Stay beautiful baby.

623
00:52:31,237 --> 00:52:34,126
Get the truck!

624
00:52:34,167 --> 00:52:37,559
- These guys are shooting at us!
- I can see these bullets in 3D!

625
00:52:37,659 --> 00:52:40,129
- Get in here!
- It's like we're actually being shot at!

626
00:52:40,143 --> 00:52:42,687
You are getting shot
at you crazy ass fool.

627
00:52:43,594 --> 00:52:45,689
- Stop right there!
- Ram it!

628
00:52:45,690 --> 00:52:47,873
Hey! I said halt!

629
00:52:47,874 --> 00:52:50,235
Yaa whoo hoo hoo!

630
00:52:50,236 --> 00:52:52,132
Damn! Sorry dude.

631
00:52:52,133 --> 00:52:55,511
- It looks like they're heading for the tarmac.
- Lets go, let's go, let's go.

632
00:53:01,126 --> 00:53:03,367
- Gentlemen.
- Holy shit!

633
00:53:03,838 --> 00:53:07,472
Are any of you armed and/or
wanted federal fugitives?

634
00:53:07,778 --> 00:53:11,359
- No.
- Well we're both, which means.

635
00:53:14,929 --> 00:53:18,123
- You're taking the plane?
- And that's why I joined the army.

636
00:53:18,468 --> 00:53:23,250
- Man up and get in there!
- Best and brightest, appreciate
it boys that will be all.

637
00:53:23,251 --> 00:53:25,526
- Anyone got the keys? I just need the keys.
- What! What? What you talking about keys?

638
00:53:25,527 --> 00:53:28,160
- I do need keys.
- For what? This is a bad idea.

639
00:53:28,161 --> 00:53:30,243
We just broke this guy
out of the psych ward.

640
00:53:30,244 --> 00:53:33,854
- Hannibal, you let the real pilots go?
- BA relax, you're going to be fine.

641
00:53:33,855 --> 00:53:36,543
- Here take one of these.
- Will they knock me out?

642
00:53:36,544 --> 00:53:37,943
They better knock me out.

643
00:53:37,944 --> 00:53:40,854
- Cause if they don't I'm gonna knock you out.
- Bosco, the buttons are confusing me I don't...

644
00:53:40,855 --> 00:53:43,996
- Shut up Murdock!
- Come on Murdock, let's go.

645
00:53:43,997 --> 00:53:47,389
- I'm turning myself in.
- Come on, come on Murdock.

646
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:48,188
I got lucky.

647
00:53:48,189 --> 00:53:50,905
Hang on boys.

648
00:53:56,687 --> 00:53:58,921
Stop.

649
00:54:01,515 --> 00:54:05,107
- Face, your girlfriend's back.
- Reverse now.

650
00:54:06,328 --> 00:54:08,412
Move your ass!

651
00:54:08,471 --> 00:54:11,630
- The C130 vs. the Mercedes Benz.
- Take us off Murdock.

652
00:54:13,476 --> 00:54:15,728
- Faster!
- I've got it pinned!

653
00:54:26,746 --> 00:54:29,443
Holy!

654
00:54:38,444 --> 00:54:40,722
Get us to flight control.

655
00:54:41,395 --> 00:54:45,957
Ladies and Gentlemen we are expecting slight
turbulence, please remain in your seats,

656
00:54:46,057 --> 00:54:48,481
until the captain has turned
off the fasten seatbelt sign.

657
00:54:49,095 --> 00:54:53,320
Don't worry boys! Turbulence
has never brought down a plane!

658
00:54:55,582 --> 00:54:59,312
- What the hell is that?
- That...

659
00:54:59,411 --> 00:55:01,699
We've got sub swirling
UAV's and missile lock!

660
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:04,737
And they bring down planes all the time.

661
00:55:06,704 --> 00:55:10,075
Okay they're coming in
launching counter measures!

662
00:55:19,209 --> 00:55:23,610
Did you see that? That's my dialed vision.

663
00:55:29,064 --> 00:55:32,666
Hang on, Hold on! We're going over!

664
00:55:33,032 --> 00:55:35,846
Murdock, what the hell are you doing?

665
00:55:36,521 --> 00:55:41,394
Whooo hoo hoo! You boys remember Mexico?!

666
00:55:41,494 --> 00:55:45,100
Ladies and gentlemen from the flight deck.
If you look out of the right hand side of

667
00:55:45,101 --> 00:55:50,935
the aircraft you'll notice
that the right wing is on fire.

668
00:55:50,936 --> 00:55:53,773
Tango, re-acquired.
Missile lock pending sir.

669
00:55:53,774 --> 00:55:56,904
This is a DCIS Major, do
not shoot that aircraft down.

670
00:55:56,905 --> 00:56:00,281
Scramble fighters and force them to land.
There are federal fugitives on that plane.

671
00:56:00,282 --> 00:56:01,952
They've also stolen
property from the US Army.

672
00:56:01,953 --> 00:56:04,297
Billy, Billy I need to get the O
scan view off my monitor right now.

673
00:56:09,049 --> 00:56:11,030
Missile away sir.

674
00:56:14,298 --> 00:56:17,488
We have shoot down. Hercules has
been intercepted and destroyed.

675
00:56:17,493 --> 00:56:19,689
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

676
00:56:30,206 --> 00:56:32,889
- I don't believe it.
- Sir we have chute deployment on the Beauford.

677
00:56:32,988 --> 00:56:34,283
What?

678
00:56:34,362 --> 00:56:39,876
I want these drones taken off line right
now! Whoever's running these drones... !

679
00:56:39,877 --> 00:56:43,178
- Get me the direct line! Whoever...
- We gotta get these drone down,
I'm gonna be on bitch duty.

680
00:56:43,179 --> 00:56:45,744
We need to get those men alive!

681
00:56:50,911 --> 00:56:54,400
- Everybody okay?
- What are the chances they think we're dead?

682
00:56:57,407 --> 00:56:59,733
- Not great!
- Tell me we ain't still on that plane.

683
00:56:59,734 --> 00:57:01,654
We ain't on that plane.

684
00:57:01,655 --> 00:57:04,691
Hannibal if we're under 20,000
feet we can still breathe right.

685
00:57:04,692 --> 00:57:09,426
- What you talking about 20,000 feet!?
- Let's fire up the old weapon system.

686
00:57:09,427 --> 00:57:12,209
Hey Bosco! It's a little stuffy.
I'm going to pop a window!

687
00:57:16,264 --> 00:57:21,641
Yeah! What you got
bitches! ! What you got!!

688
00:57:21,642 --> 00:57:25,855
Yeah!!

689
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,000
- Let me at them too Face, come on!
- Why are we in a falling can?!!

690
00:57:29,001 --> 00:57:30,729
Because the plane exploded!!

691
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:34,721
- What? What?!! When?
- Recently, the Reaper shot it down.

692
00:57:34,756 --> 00:57:36,581
What Reaper?!

693
00:57:38,672 --> 00:57:42,492
- The flying ones that are still trying to kill us!
- I blame you Hannibal!

694
00:57:42,592 --> 00:57:46,142
- Technically, we're not flying.
- I know, we falling fool!

695
00:57:52,857 --> 00:57:54,906
Oh Jesus!

696
00:57:54,907 --> 00:57:57,756
UAV2 has splashed down. We
just lost one of the drones.

697
00:57:57,757 --> 00:58:00,376
Hannibal, we're in trouble!!

698
00:58:03,788 --> 00:58:05,858
Awesome!

699
00:58:06,404 --> 00:58:10,749
Face, get onto the main gun. There's a
lake a half mile away from this position.

700
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:15,060
- What the hell am I trying to hit?!!
- Trust me! Rotate the turret at 82 degrees!

701
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:17,400
Fire in the hole!

702
00:58:17,515 --> 00:58:20,578
Yeah! Boom!

703
00:58:20,985 --> 00:58:23,250
Fire!

704
00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:31,119
- Is he trying to shoot down that other drone?
- No, they're trying to fly that tank.

705
00:58:31,165 --> 00:58:33,804
- He's flying the tank!
- You can't fly a tank fool!

706
00:58:33,805 --> 00:58:37,224
Rotate 16 degrees. Fire!

707
00:58:42,031 --> 00:58:44,607
- Rotate 34 degrees. Now!
- Hannibal!!

708
00:58:44,608 --> 00:58:47,302
Wait... Fire!!

709
00:58:49,008 --> 00:58:52,448
- Control, we have lost UAV.
- Is that a confirmed hit?

710
00:58:52,449 --> 00:58:55,438
Right turn full front and wait!!

711
00:58:57,415 --> 00:59:00,637
- Murdock, close the hatch!
- Hatch! Okay!

712
00:59:00,638 --> 00:59:03,786
Come on baby.

713
00:59:05,893 --> 00:59:09,720
- I'm too young to die!!
- Boss! I'm aiming at nothing.

714
00:59:10,707 --> 00:59:13,295
- Come on.
- It's been an honor gentlemen.

715
00:59:13,396 --> 00:59:16,853
- Come on baby.
- The greatest ride is the last ride Colonel.

716
00:59:16,854 --> 00:59:19,602
- Fire everything!!
- Come on baby!!

717
00:59:25,091 --> 00:59:29,090
Come on!!

718
01:00:07,576 --> 01:00:11,222
All right busy bees, busy bees.

719
01:00:11,296 --> 01:00:13,337
Guys you can take your coats off.

720
01:00:13,759 --> 01:00:16,409
It's hot as hell in here.
Sweating like a whore in church.

721
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:17,806
- Sir?
- Yeah

722
01:00:17,807 --> 01:00:20,860
Smith and his team were engaged
in a C130 over Mannheim, Germany,

723
01:00:20,861 --> 01:00:22,663
by two Reaper drones.

724
01:00:22,763 --> 01:00:25,100
I'm not sure if it's an encryption glitch

725
01:00:25,101 --> 01:00:28,085
but it says that they
were shot down in a tank.

726
01:00:28,086 --> 01:00:31,597
NORAD's calling it an exhale
but there's an afflicting report.

727
01:00:32,857 --> 01:00:35,044
I'm sure there is.

728
01:00:35,128 --> 01:00:37,430
We got a German housebrau
who says she saw a tank

729
01:00:37,431 --> 01:00:40,369
driving up and out of lake Volgelstein
with a guy resembling Murdock.

730
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:44,912
- Excuse me! Which way to Berlin?
- Asking for directions to Berlin.

731
01:00:45,436 --> 01:00:48,557
- That's impossible.
- Well this will be the second time

732
01:00:48,657 --> 01:00:52,343
Smith has died this
week. Is that possible?

733
01:00:57,710 --> 01:00:59,266
What have you got for me?

734
01:00:59,761 --> 01:01:04,330
We just got the unscrambled composite
of Smith's visitor in prison.

735
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:06,936
But with no ID on the subject yet.

736
01:01:07,419 --> 01:01:09,442
Hello handsome.

737
01:01:09,955 --> 01:01:12,217
Wait, I've seen this person before.

738
01:01:12,351 --> 01:01:15,813
I know this guy.

739
01:01:17,418 --> 01:01:19,148
Baghdad.

740
01:01:19,224 --> 01:01:22,669
Get me a clean patch to
Langley we're going fishing.

741
01:01:22,999 --> 01:01:26,499
- I heard bits and pieces but...
- Sir?

742
01:01:26,627 --> 01:01:28,124
- I have...
- I was talking.

743
01:01:28,249 --> 01:01:31,848
Can you stop? I have a D.O. D
hardline from Lieutenant Sosa.

744
01:01:31,849 --> 01:01:33,901
She's looking for Agent Lynch.

745
01:01:33,937 --> 01:01:35,737
Yeah, he's not available... ever.

746
01:01:35,889 --> 01:01:38,436
Agent Lynch, from Baghdad?

747
01:01:39,752 --> 01:01:42,001
General Morrison's tent?

748
01:01:43,363 --> 01:01:45,724
Out.

749
01:01:46,276 --> 01:01:48,317
Why do we have her?

750
01:01:48,457 --> 01:01:51,814
She's got a fantastic
personality, that's why.

751
01:01:52,236 --> 01:01:53,871
With whom am I speaking?

752
01:01:54,138 --> 01:01:57,999
This is Capt... uh Lieutenant
Sosa. Is this Agent Lynch?

753
01:01:58,041 --> 01:02:00,668
- Sorry, I don't have a first name.
- Neither do I.

754
01:02:01,276 --> 01:02:03,303
So what can I do you for Lieutenant?

755
01:02:03,367 --> 01:02:07,674
I'm looking at an image of you from the
disciplinary barracks of Fort Carson.

756
01:02:08,068 --> 01:02:09,833
She's hot.

757
01:02:09,856 --> 01:02:13,466
Did you visit former Colonel
Hannibal Smith in prison?

758
01:02:15,405 --> 01:02:19,972
I don't know what you're
talking about former Captain.

759
01:02:20,072 --> 01:02:23,000
Agent Lynch, if you facilitated
Smith's escape and are

760
01:02:23,001 --> 01:02:26,277
currently aiding and abetting him...

761
01:02:26,278 --> 01:02:28,983
oh buddy...

762
01:02:29,082 --> 01:02:30,178
If you could make
something like that stick,

763
01:02:30,179 --> 01:02:33,685
your next promotion should
be in the five star range.

764
01:02:33,686 --> 01:02:36,216
And if you're helping to
retrieve those engraving plates,

765
01:02:36,496 --> 01:02:41,685
I'm going to have to go out
of my way to disappoint you.

766
01:02:49,351 --> 01:02:53,573
I want her phones, her computers,
any support packages she operates.

767
01:02:53,574 --> 01:02:57,055
I want to know everything. I want active
intercept ops on everything she's got.

768
01:02:57,056 --> 01:02:58,950
I want every move monitored
from this moment forward.

769
01:02:58,951 --> 01:03:04,111
- You realize she's D.O.D?
- I don't care if she's G.O.D, do it.

770
01:03:05,012 --> 01:03:07,833
Boss, check this out.

771
01:03:07,834 --> 01:03:11,679
We've tracked this photograph of
Pike to the Konigsbank in Frankfurt.

772
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:14,700
Our surveillance has him and
an unknown Arab making regular

773
01:03:14,701 --> 01:03:16,107
trips from the train station to the bank

774
01:03:16,108 --> 01:03:19,694
- all over the last month.
- Pikes getting sloppy.

775
01:03:19,794 --> 01:03:21,800
Yeah but if we're on to him what
are the odds that Smith and his team

776
01:03:21,801 --> 01:03:22,641
are on to Pike and the Arab too?

777
01:03:22,642 --> 01:03:25,413
This is a direct pull-down
from the Pentagon's database.

778
01:03:25,414 --> 01:03:28,260
There's absolutely no way Smith
and his team could have this stuff.

779
01:03:28,261 --> 01:03:32,535
I think we should assume they have
more information than us at all times.

780
01:03:32,772 --> 01:03:35,000
Pike has been moving the
stolen engraving plates to the.

781
01:03:35,001 --> 01:03:37,724
Konigsbank tower in
Frankfurt over the past month.

782
01:03:37,725 --> 01:03:40,800
Tomorrow the last of the cases
containing these plates will be

783
01:03:40,801 --> 01:03:42,689
transferred to the Arab.

784
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:45,000
This will mark the only
time in the last six months

785
01:03:45,001 --> 01:03:47,363
that all the plates have
been in one location.

786
01:03:47,364 --> 01:03:50,314
It's our best and only
shot at getting them back.

787
01:03:50,315 --> 01:03:54,042
They leave the Konigsbank tower
for the 7:15 train to Zurich.

788
01:03:54,043 --> 01:03:58,872
Gentlemen, we're going to
make sure they miss that train.

789
01:03:58,939 --> 01:04:00,810
- Face.
- Yeah.

790
01:04:00,811 --> 01:04:03,033
Time to bring in your former flame.

791
01:04:03,034 --> 01:04:05,742
If she's as good as I think then
she'll be on her way to Frankfurt

792
01:04:05,743 --> 01:04:09,509
to intercept those plates.

793
01:04:09,510 --> 01:04:11,310
Why would you tip her off?

794
01:04:11,372 --> 01:04:14,616
She's a crusader and we're
going to need her at some point.

795
01:04:14,716 --> 01:04:16,786
Keep your eyes and ears open boys.

796
01:04:21,056 --> 01:04:24,033
Now the wrinkle. If Sosa's on to us

797
01:04:24,068 --> 01:04:27,609
we can assume that Lynch is on to her.

798
01:04:27,627 --> 01:04:30,530
And if he thinks she stands
between him and those plates,

799
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:35,490
he won't hesitate to kill her.
Face, get to the train station.

800
01:04:37,822 --> 01:04:40,435
This is Sosa.

801
01:04:40,436 --> 01:04:43,076
If there's a threat
from Lynch deal with it.

802
01:04:43,077 --> 01:04:44,770
Hello?

803
01:04:44,771 --> 01:04:47,770
Shooter's green, say
again... shooter's green.

804
01:04:48,695 --> 01:04:52,653
Hello?

805
01:04:56,064 --> 01:04:58,597
Something's wrong.

806
01:05:00,618 --> 01:05:03,628
We're marked guys, pull back.
I don't like this at all.

807
01:05:03,803 --> 01:05:07,220
See, don't be seen.

808
01:05:08,749 --> 01:05:11,782
- Hello beautiful...
- You've got some balls you
put a drop phone on me?

809
01:05:12,153 --> 01:05:15,382
I had to baby, it's the only way I could
talk to you. Lynch has all your comm lines.

810
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:18,680
- I want you to pull your team now.
- I'm going to find you Face.

811
01:05:18,681 --> 01:05:21,533
But do not engage her
or anyone else directly.

812
01:05:21,534 --> 01:05:23,828
Not if I find you first.

813
01:05:34,477 --> 01:05:36,826
Oww !! Jesus.

814
01:05:37,354 --> 01:05:41,344
- What the hell are you doing?
- Trying to save you.

815
01:05:44,146 --> 01:05:48,784
Charisa, come on you know we're innocent.

816
01:05:48,821 --> 01:05:51,188
- You know this.
- You're lying.

817
01:05:51,206 --> 01:05:55,360
- Like you lied in Baghdad.
- I did not, no I knew nothing about the plates.

818
01:05:55,483 --> 01:05:57,930
At that... at that time.

819
01:05:58,318 --> 01:06:00,813
You are completely full of shit!

820
01:06:00,848 --> 01:06:03,434
Would you stop selling yourself on that
voiding the fact that you lied to me.

821
01:06:03,534 --> 01:06:05,642
- When?
- Oh come on, you want to go there?

822
01:06:06,008 --> 01:06:08,624
Okay you heard I was in
play and you wanted to play.

823
01:06:08,625 --> 01:06:11,842
- Then I got serious, and you freaked!
- Oh I freaked?

824
01:06:11,942 --> 01:06:16,433
- I did not freak!
- You panicked, and you ran.

825
01:06:22,831 --> 01:06:27,232
Charisa, come on, I am a federal
fugitive, you know exactly how wanted I am.

826
01:06:27,344 --> 01:06:31,030
You think I came to Frankfurt to
hash out some old heart break, no.

827
01:06:31,031 --> 01:06:34,537
I'm here because we didn't do this.
I'm here because we were set up.

828
01:06:34,538 --> 01:06:37,930
I'm here because in the end
the truth is worth the risk.

829
01:06:40,359 --> 01:06:44,619
And I believe in you even
if you don't believe in me.

830
01:06:48,403 --> 01:06:51,322
God, I forgot how beautiful you are.

831
01:06:55,862 --> 01:06:58,859
Hold on to that phone.

832
01:07:14,886 --> 01:07:17,449
Sucker.

833
01:07:18,882 --> 01:07:23,435
- Oh shit, where's Peck.
- Excellent question, find him!

834
01:08:31,530 --> 01:08:36,272
Okay, let's dance... coming
down positions, prepare to move.

835
01:08:36,739 --> 01:08:39,827
As always, stay close to me sir.

836
01:09:00,509 --> 01:09:03,754
- I can't see anything.
- How we doing there big man?

837
01:09:04,035 --> 01:09:09,043
- Murdock, here comes the Arab.
- It's a long drive deep into left center field.

838
01:09:09,123 --> 01:09:13,806
Murdock is back, he's at the
wall and he makes the catch!

839
01:09:35,627 --> 01:09:40,034
BA, I lost the case. I'm
taking fire, I'm out of here.

840
01:09:48,968 --> 01:09:52,141
BA, get to those plates.

841
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,303
A bunch of federals responding to explosions
and shots fired at the Konigsbank building.

842
01:10:46,304 --> 01:10:50,042
All right get us out of this place and
to that building as soon as possible.

843
01:11:04,950 --> 01:11:06,825
Whooo.

844
01:11:07,826 --> 01:11:11,817
You made me work for this one Baracus.
I didn't think I was this out of shape.

845
01:11:12,404 --> 01:11:16,621
I am unfortunately. Where's
the rest of the team huh?

846
01:11:16,721 --> 01:11:22,371
Smith, Peck, that idiot pilot,
the asshole. What's his name?

847
01:11:27,769 --> 01:11:30,985
I'm gonna take this one out on your
ass Baracus, let's see what you got.

848
01:11:34,387 --> 01:11:37,629
- Come on, what are you doing? Are you tired?
- I'm not going to hurt you man.

849
01:11:37,638 --> 01:11:41,358
No you're not going to hurt
me I'm going to hurt you.

850
01:11:44,601 --> 01:11:46,200
I don't want to kill you man.

851
01:11:46,201 --> 01:11:49,233
You don't want to kill me, you're not going
to kill me. I'm going to kill you Baracus.

852
01:11:49,234 --> 01:11:52,978
- I'm not playing with you Pike.
- Here we go, 'cause I've got two guns, one
is on my left here, remember that, right?

853
01:11:52,979 --> 01:11:55,415
As soon as that hammer goes back, it's on.

854
01:11:55,416 --> 01:11:59,305
- I swear to God I'll do it.
- You're not a killer, are you?

855
01:11:59,541 --> 01:12:02,461
Are you?

856
01:12:05,822 --> 01:12:07,802
- Whoopsie.
- Damn!

857
01:12:08,034 --> 01:12:10,000
- You all right big fellow?
- You're a lifesaver man, I couldn't shoot him.

858
01:12:18,423 --> 01:12:21,606
Get out of the way!

859
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:54,514
- US Military, we got him.
- Yeah, this is about the right amount of cops.

860
01:12:54,549 --> 01:12:57,469
That's cute. You're lucky
there are people around.

861
01:12:57,673 --> 01:13:00,856
No sweetheart, you're lucky.

862
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:08,911
All right, not a peep out of the Arab.

863
01:13:10,011 --> 01:13:11,734
Sosa was at the train station.

864
01:13:11,754 --> 01:13:13,929
- You saw her?
- Yeah.

865
01:13:14,014 --> 01:13:16,477
- Did you talk to her?
- I had no choice okay just...

866
01:13:16,563 --> 01:13:19,165
- trust me on that.
- Oh I trust you...

867
01:13:19,265 --> 01:13:22,215
to make historically bad decisions
where women are concerned.

868
01:13:22,216 --> 01:13:24,623
What part of you is
thinking at the moment?

869
01:13:24,624 --> 01:13:26,263
Well Lynch's men moved in
on her and I had to react.

870
01:13:26,264 --> 01:13:31,559
- Please, somehow I doubt that.
- Hey, what are you so pissed about?

871
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:34,579
We got the plates, you wanted
her teed up, she's teed up.

872
01:13:34,580 --> 01:13:36,886
She knows we didn't steal them.

873
01:13:37,628 --> 01:13:40,492
She'll be thrilled to find out who did.

874
01:13:41,073 --> 01:13:45,740
- What?
- He had to know.

875
01:13:46,776 --> 01:13:50,378
You had to know.

876
01:13:50,717 --> 01:13:54,605
You had to know if you left
me alive that this was coming.

877
01:13:59,357 --> 01:14:02,241
How could you not?

878
01:14:05,623 --> 01:14:07,669
Hannibal?

879
01:14:08,018 --> 01:14:10,467
Do you know who this is?

880
01:14:17,785 --> 01:14:20,617
We all do.

881
01:14:22,735 --> 01:14:26,751
- Morrison?
- Oh, hell no.

882
01:14:27,207 --> 01:14:28,750
Jesus Christ.

883
01:14:28,773 --> 01:14:35,815
Not so sure that it is a blessing
but, good hunting my friend.

884
01:14:35,879 --> 01:14:40,762
- Thank you.
- You son of a bitch.

885
01:14:45,226 --> 01:14:48,540
Morrison, holy shit.

886
01:14:48,944 --> 01:14:54,118
Outside, all of you. Outside now!

887
01:14:54,947 --> 01:14:59,487
I knew if Lynch helped me
escape, you had to be part of it.

888
01:15:01,296 --> 01:15:06,237
You and Pike were making a play on those
plates with Lynch, and you turned on him.

889
01:15:06,598 --> 01:15:11,303
- The way you turned of us.
- Lynch was never going to cut us in.

890
01:15:12,644 --> 01:15:17,255
He was going to use us he
brought you on as insurance.

891
01:15:17,572 --> 01:15:21,458
You never thought you'd betrayed
your oldest living friend?

892
01:15:21,854 --> 01:15:24,960
I just hit first Hannibal.
I'm a fighting man.

893
01:15:25,305 --> 01:15:28,092
You're a liar and a traitor.

894
01:15:28,093 --> 01:15:31,719
You knew Morrison was masquerading
as the Arab. Why not share that?

895
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:34,299
- I wasn't one hundred percent sure.
- How about ninety nine percent?

896
01:15:34,582 --> 01:15:37,212
Would you think it was
worth mentioning then?

897
01:15:37,752 --> 01:15:41,473
Lynch, what did you think? Did you
think I would just kill him on the spot?

898
01:15:41,572 --> 01:15:43,568
Well I was certain of it I still am.

899
01:15:44,011 --> 01:15:47,368
- Do you have the plates?
- I wouldn't be calling you if I didn't.

900
01:15:47,830 --> 01:15:52,383
Smith, return the plates, kill
Morrison and reclaim your lives.

901
01:15:52,675 --> 01:15:56,162
I want signed and authorized
Amnesty agreements for myself

902
01:15:56,163 --> 01:15:57,979
and for each of my men,

903
01:15:57,980 --> 01:16:01,972
from the White House, the State
Department and the joint Chiefs of Staff.

904
01:16:02,079 --> 01:16:04,120
You hear me?

905
01:16:05,252 --> 01:16:09,923
- Well I'm going to need a little more time.
- How much?

906
01:16:15,361 --> 01:16:19,396
- Give me five minutes.
- I'm waiting.

907
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:40,046
I saw your tomb at Arlington.

908
01:16:40,145 --> 01:16:44,140
You died a National hero.

909
01:16:54,168 --> 01:16:57,087
Death is too easy.

910
01:16:57,187 --> 01:17:01,141
- And the last thing we need is another lie.
- Don't do this, Hannibal please.

911
01:17:01,142 --> 01:17:04,951
- You owe me that much.
- You owe me!

912
01:17:04,952 --> 01:17:09,400
You're going to tell them
we're innocent. You owe me.

913
01:17:10,948 --> 01:17:15,210
Hannibal, it's meaningless
what are you fighting for now?

914
01:17:15,211 --> 01:17:16,805
You and those boys.

915
01:17:16,806 --> 01:17:20,667
Your rank, your reputation. They're shit!

916
01:17:20,915 --> 01:17:26,205
You're convicts, plates or no
plates you're federal fugitives.

917
01:17:26,621 --> 01:17:29,988
And when they're done with you
Hannibal, they'll just burn you.

918
01:17:30,585 --> 01:17:34,719
Zulu 1 Zulu, 1 this is broadsword
you are clear to engage.

919
01:17:34,772 --> 01:17:38,324
Broadsword? Did you come up
with that? That's awesome.

920
01:17:42,305 --> 01:17:45,040
Boss could you do that?

921
01:17:47,217 --> 01:17:50,439
To us What Morrison did?

922
01:17:50,652 --> 01:17:55,377
No, I'd rather Face a firing
squad than betray you boys.

923
01:17:55,594 --> 01:17:57,670
Yeah but you didn't see it coming though.

924
01:17:57,789 --> 01:18:03,913
No I... I didn't see it coming.

925
01:18:08,715 --> 01:18:10,986
Move!

926
01:18:21,227 --> 01:18:24,696
Wow, that's awesome.

927
01:18:24,712 --> 01:18:27,207
That looks exactly like
Call of Duty doesn't it.

928
01:18:27,281 --> 01:18:31,594
All right here's the deal, no press release
keep local law enforcement and media off site.

929
01:18:31,740 --> 01:18:34,052
Get a three mile quarantine
dead over the no fly zone.

930
01:18:34,421 --> 01:18:38,991
Get me an agency scrub team out there
and get me the God damn plates back.

931
01:18:39,198 --> 01:18:44,528
The German police have your entire
team in custody in Konigsbank Tower.

932
01:18:44,905 --> 01:18:49,822
I don't do teams babe, that's
Smith's bag. I'm strictly a solo act.

933
01:18:57,881 --> 01:19:05,106
I like to travel light. Stuff like uh...
loyalty doesn't fit in the overhead bins.

934
01:19:05,570 --> 01:19:08,552
I thought you and Smith
were working together.

935
01:19:09,306 --> 01:19:11,522
You thought wrong.

936
01:19:11,557 --> 01:19:14,327
Yes we have weapons.
No, you may not wand us.

937
01:19:16,281 --> 01:19:18,787
You want a deal? I'll make you a deal.

938
01:19:18,856 --> 01:19:23,330
How about I dedicate my immediate future

939
01:19:23,889 --> 01:19:28,265
- to destroying yours?
- How about you get smart

940
01:19:28,423 --> 01:19:32,162
and start dealing before
somebody else does.

941
01:19:34,482 --> 01:19:37,233
Former Captain. Whoa, whoa whoa.

942
01:19:37,903 --> 01:19:40,523
Unless you've got a piece of paper
that looks exactly like this one,

943
01:19:40,524 --> 01:19:43,481
then this troubled young
loner belongs to me.

944
01:19:43,482 --> 01:19:45,526
Let's go.

945
01:19:45,527 --> 01:19:47,391
How the hell did they
get an extradition order?

946
01:19:47,392 --> 01:19:49,692
Sorry Pike, at least
with me there are rules.

947
01:19:49,982 --> 01:19:53,474
The CIA's got rules. Our rules
are just cooler than yours.

948
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,099
Go.

949
01:19:55,100 --> 01:19:57,300
You know Lynch, if I could
seal this room with you inside,

950
01:19:57,301 --> 01:19:59,350
I'd be doing the world a big favor.

951
01:19:59,351 --> 01:20:01,459
That's not nice.

952
01:20:01,846 --> 01:20:06,178
- Answer me.
- Stay close to the fires boys.

953
01:20:06,179 --> 01:20:10,052
If that gun ship is still around
it won't read our body heat.

954
01:20:10,053 --> 01:20:14,061
Idiot Lynch, was so quick to kill
us didn't bother locating the plates.

955
01:20:14,062 --> 01:20:17,171
Where do we stand in non violence now BA?

956
01:20:17,378 --> 01:20:19,462
Are you pissed? You should be.

957
01:20:19,463 --> 01:20:22,526
Who gives a shit about the plates?
Morrison was the only way to clear us,

958
01:20:22,527 --> 01:20:25,428
and without Morrison, we got nothing.

959
01:20:25,948 --> 01:20:28,771
- What do we do boss?
- I don't know Murdock.

960
01:20:29,084 --> 01:20:31,877
- I don't know.
- I do.

961
01:20:32,267 --> 01:20:36,447
This guy Lynch, I think
I've got him figured out.

962
01:20:36,883 --> 01:20:39,901
- You got a plan kid?
- How do we get out of here?

963
01:20:40,057 --> 01:20:42,785
Give me twenty minutes.

964
01:20:45,941 --> 01:20:49,017
So Morrison's dead Smith
and his team are dead.

965
01:20:49,765 --> 01:20:52,950
Another fifteen minutes or so
we'll locate those engraving plates.

966
01:20:52,951 --> 01:20:55,546
- This is you gloating?
- No this is me beating you.

967
01:20:55,547 --> 01:20:59,107
After you burned me.
We had a deal, remember?

968
01:20:59,207 --> 01:21:01,109
- Not you and me.
- You, me and Morrison.

969
01:21:01,236 --> 01:21:04,606
- Not you and me directly.
- And you two collude and cut me out?

970
01:21:06,076 --> 01:21:09,585
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Are we going to do this in the car?

971
01:21:09,724 --> 01:21:13,711
- He's going to do it?
- Way to go, that's brilliant right there.

972
01:21:13,789 --> 01:21:18,096
- What are you doing? What is he doing?
- How's it going Kyle, are you all right?

973
01:21:18,352 --> 01:21:21,166
- I'm good.
- Brother you are far from good.

974
01:21:21,260 --> 01:21:24,499
What are you doing?

975
01:21:24,599 --> 01:21:26,649
It's a suppressor counter clockwise.

976
01:21:26,845 --> 01:21:28,466
You're holding a gun like that?
You've held a gun like that before

977
01:21:28,467 --> 01:21:31,152
and you're still here? That's amazing.

978
01:21:31,153 --> 01:21:34,633
Jesus, hey, final request don't
let this guy shoot me please.

979
01:21:40,336 --> 01:21:44,885
- So if Sosa knows we're alive.
- She'll think Morrison's alive too.

980
01:21:45,341 --> 01:21:48,531
Let's just hope that Lynch
still has Sosa's comm line.

981
01:21:50,406 --> 01:21:55,642
- This is Sosa.
- General Morrison is in my possession.

982
01:21:55,764 --> 01:21:58,260
What? I'm sorry I can't
hear you who is this?

983
01:21:58,546 --> 01:22:01,807
- Okay this was not well thought out.
- No shit?

984
01:22:02,276 --> 01:22:04,386
I mean I gotta teach you how to
kill me hey, do me a favor all right?

985
01:22:04,537 --> 01:22:07,032
- Put the barrel, put the gun flush to my head.
- Are you sure?

986
01:22:07,069 --> 01:22:11,502
- There you go, right there.
- Is that going to go right through?

987
01:22:12,181 --> 01:22:14,064
We're okay.

988
01:22:14,276 --> 01:22:16,645
Never cuff a man ia a seated position
with his hands behind his back

989
01:22:16,646 --> 01:22:18,659
makes it impossible to see the hands.

990
01:22:18,660 --> 01:22:21,455
- That was cool.
- You liked that?

991
01:22:21,559 --> 01:22:25,346
Oh I liked that, I liked that a
lot. Are you all right, you idiot?

992
01:22:25,476 --> 01:22:27,963
- Yeah it was a good hit.
- Please handcuff him.

993
01:22:28,015 --> 01:22:30,221
We don't need to use them
again we don't need the cuffs.

994
01:22:30,222 --> 01:22:31,442
Who are you talking to?

995
01:22:31,443 --> 01:22:34,746
Brad, phone or gun phone or gun, pick.

996
01:22:35,157 --> 01:22:38,734
- Put the gun down.
- Hey, I didn't burn you, Morrison did.

997
01:22:39,101 --> 01:22:42,099
- I really want to shoot you.
- You've got to hear this sir.

998
01:22:42,212 --> 01:22:46,014
- Is this Smith?
- I'm a former Colonel to a former Captain.

999
01:22:46,015 --> 01:22:49,223
I know I've got about thirty
seconds before you lock this signal.

1000
01:22:49,224 --> 01:22:52,451
So listen, we can prove our innocence.

1001
01:22:52,577 --> 01:22:57,261
Okay now go back to.. did you say you
have Morrison? You have General Morrison.

1002
01:22:57,481 --> 01:22:59,390
- Correct.
- You have him alive?

1003
01:22:59,391 --> 01:23:00,774
And well.

1004
01:23:00,775 --> 01:23:02,919
That's why Lynch is trying
to wipe us out wholesale.

1005
01:23:03,326 --> 01:23:07,243
Too much to explain now, but
Morrison's testimony frees us,

1006
01:23:07,773 --> 01:23:09,982
and fries Lynch.

1007
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:12,164
Uh Oh.

1008
01:23:12,165 --> 01:23:16,346
- Well not without the plates.
- Also in my possession.

1009
01:23:16,446 --> 01:23:18,904
Remember, Lynch thinks we're dead

1010
01:23:18,938 --> 01:23:23,017
- and I want to keep it that way.
- Give me a pen.

1011
01:23:23,146 --> 01:23:24,715
You still use a pen?

1012
01:23:24,815 --> 01:23:28,435
LA docks, 48 hours, dawn. If I
deliver Morrison and the plates.

1013
01:23:28,516 --> 01:23:33,107
In return, I want a re-trial
in front of a civilian court.

1014
01:23:33,502 --> 01:23:38,188
All right we'll deal. LA
docks 48 hours from now.

1015
01:23:38,295 --> 01:23:42,087
Any bullshit from your end
and that's it, deals off.

1016
01:23:43,919 --> 01:23:47,006
- Did we get him?
- No.

1017
01:23:49,174 --> 01:23:52,714
Pike, do you believe in second chances?

1018
01:23:53,615 --> 01:23:56,427
Ahhh... I do now.

1019
01:23:56,685 --> 01:24:00,621
- Too much?
- I thought you were spot on.

1020
01:24:02,001 --> 01:24:04,525
My turn.

1021
01:24:13,572 --> 01:24:15,834
Hold on to that phone.

1022
01:24:23,163 --> 01:24:26,854
- This is Sosa.
- Hello, beautiful.

1023
01:24:27,308 --> 01:24:29,572
Thank you.

1024
01:24:36,573 --> 01:24:38,702
Well they got the raw end
of the deal, didn't they?

1025
01:24:38,703 --> 01:24:42,128
Look at BA He looks like a huge banana

1026
01:24:42,774 --> 01:24:45,391
- Good morning my friend.
- Good morning.

1027
01:24:49,473 --> 01:24:52,859
Rabbi Binky Rabinowits?

1028
01:24:52,860 --> 01:24:57,201
- What passport did I give you?
- You are from Tanzania?

1029
01:24:57,202 --> 01:25:00,746
- My mother is from Tanzania.
- Oh shit, what the hell happened?

1030
01:25:08,756 --> 01:25:12,775
Converting.

1031
01:25:12,776 --> 01:25:15,347
Let's go right into move.
There's three to my right.

1032
01:25:15,348 --> 01:25:18,058
There's two behind me and
one at the northeast exit.

1033
01:25:26,502 --> 01:25:29,015
Shalom.

1034
01:25:37,652 --> 01:25:39,904
- There is a God.
- You speak Swahili?

1035
01:25:40,003 --> 01:25:41,496
You don't?

1036
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:43,455
You got enough to work with kid?

1037
01:25:43,502 --> 01:25:46,490
We will, you and I have some
major favors moving across

1038
01:25:46,491 --> 01:25:47,595
the Atlantic right now.

1039
01:25:47,596 --> 01:25:50,729
Some deep sea freighters with
some strictly black market merch.

1040
01:25:50,730 --> 01:25:52,133
How do we get out to her?

1041
01:25:52,605 --> 01:25:54,933
A boat, a plain old boat. That's
what I'm talking about Murdock.

1042
01:25:54,934 --> 01:25:58,500
I'm talking overseas in style. That's
how I like to travel, classy like.

1043
01:25:58,501 --> 01:26:01,433
These things are safe,
we don't need planes.

1044
01:26:01,434 --> 01:26:05,154
You know Bosco, hopefully one day
we'll get you over your fear of flying.

1045
01:26:06,913 --> 01:26:11,616
- Hey, that ain't no boat!
- That did it.

1046
01:26:11,716 --> 01:26:15,570
Murdock just remember what I
said I said you have to catch him,

1047
01:26:15,571 --> 01:26:20,253
after you inject him.

1048
01:26:20,254 --> 01:26:22,165
My bad.

1049
01:26:48,237 --> 01:26:50,945
Oh dammit! My head man.

1050
01:26:53,705 --> 01:26:56,715
- Coconut curry tapenade, your favorite.
- Give me that fool.

1051
01:26:57,393 --> 01:27:00,157
You got them toast points?

1052
01:27:00,176 --> 01:27:03,486
Voil! Toast points.

1053
01:27:04,707 --> 01:27:07,084
You had to knock me out again huh?

1054
01:27:07,142 --> 01:27:13,164
Okay now, the whole injection
knocking out, Hannibal and Face.

1055
01:27:13,443 --> 01:27:16,667
The curry tapenade, Murdock.

1056
01:27:16,766 --> 01:27:21,981
Why do I feel like I fell
on my face huh? Tell me that.

1057
01:27:25,331 --> 01:27:27,968
Lynch's paradox... Murdock,
are you done with that?

1058
01:27:28,009 --> 01:27:33,298
This a guy who needs anonymity.
But he love the attricountaby.

1059
01:27:33,977 --> 01:27:37,522
He's an administrator,
he's not an operator.

1060
01:27:39,257 --> 01:27:41,868
Where is it?

1061
01:27:42,959 --> 01:27:47,218
Very nice. So he stays as far away
from the point of impact as possible

1062
01:27:47,318 --> 01:27:49,956
and never gets his hands
dirty if he can help it.

1063
01:27:49,957 --> 01:27:51,793
But we're going to change all of that.

1064
01:27:51,794 --> 01:27:54,567
You can't hustle a hustler fool.

1065
01:27:55,591 --> 01:27:59,674
No sparks, no flames not even
a flashlight near this stuff.

1066
01:28:02,369 --> 01:28:06,037
This guy's never at the
flashpoint of everything.

1067
01:28:07,394 --> 01:28:11,474
He's safe and sound
somewhere pulling the strings.

1068
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:13,583
Mama mama.

1069
01:28:13,584 --> 01:28:15,631
Hey boss, why so many of
these damn things anyway?

1070
01:28:15,632 --> 01:28:20,240
Because overkill is underrated my friend.

1071
01:28:20,241 --> 01:28:24,034
So we're going to bring this
guy down to ground level.

1072
01:28:24,126 --> 01:28:28,262
Mama. Lynch.

1073
01:28:28,518 --> 01:28:32,041
The last place he'd ever want to be.

1074
01:28:33,399 --> 01:28:36,516
And you put him on display
for the whole world to see.

1075
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,481
Any questions?

1076
01:28:41,482 --> 01:28:45,108
- What's up boss man?
- Hey, BA.

1077
01:28:45,253 --> 01:28:51,573
- This is going to get heavy isn't it?
- Well, I can't promise you it won't

1078
01:28:52,198 --> 01:28:53,792
I'm going to read you
something real quick.

1079
01:28:53,793 --> 01:28:57,190
Victory attained by violence

1080
01:28:57,191 --> 01:29:02,358
is tantamount to defeat
for it is momentary.

1081
01:29:02,683 --> 01:29:04,887
Ghandi.

1082
01:29:04,888 --> 01:29:08,385
It is better to be violent if
there is violence in our hearts

1083
01:29:08,386 --> 01:29:13,486
than to put on the cloak of
non-violence to cover impotence.

1084
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:17,868
- Who said that?
- Same guy.

1085
01:29:18,258 --> 01:29:22,447
Ghandi wasn't afraid to fight
for the things he believed in.

1086
01:29:23,127 --> 01:29:26,181
What is it you believe in BA?

1087
01:29:47,266 --> 01:29:48,775
What's wrong?

1088
01:29:48,776 --> 01:29:53,461
I don't know man, just
thinking about this.

1089
01:29:53,462 --> 01:29:57,180
We've always come back
alive the four of us

1090
01:29:57,181 --> 01:29:59,000
because of the old man.

1091
01:29:59,001 --> 01:30:01,495
- I know.
- I'm not him.

1092
01:30:01,595 --> 01:30:05,873
- Face, I know this.
- Murdock, I'm not Hannibal.

1093
01:30:06,385 --> 01:30:13,450
Who has the most to lose on
this Face? Me, and I trust you.

1094
01:30:14,973 --> 01:30:20,151
Yeah I know but that... you're crazy.

1095
01:30:24,147 --> 01:30:27,113
Not that crazy.

1096
01:30:43,393 --> 01:30:45,819
All eagles may have landed
everybody ready to roll?

1097
01:30:45,820 --> 01:30:47,856
Copy, team one on the move.

1098
01:30:47,857 --> 01:30:50,402
Acknowledged, team two en route.

1099
01:30:55,923 --> 01:31:00,862
All right guys, everybody ready?
The curtains about to come up.

1100
01:31:00,863 --> 01:31:03,900
Showtime.

1101
01:31:09,340 --> 01:31:12,493
That's Smith right there, watch him.

1102
01:31:13,346 --> 01:31:17,286
- All teams in position?
- Standing by.

1103
01:31:18,039 --> 01:31:20,190
In position.

1104
01:31:21,325 --> 01:31:24,652
- Shoot team one affirmative.
- Spotter 1, 10-8.

1105
01:31:25,078 --> 01:31:28,395
Less chatter, mark on comms now
Morrison's the primary tango,

1106
01:31:28,396 --> 01:31:32,210
- the plates are the package.
- Yeah?

1107
01:31:32,211 --> 01:31:35,924
Okay, okay, he's talking
to Sosa, I want this call.

1108
01:31:36,024 --> 01:31:38,000
You lied to us we had a deal!

1109
01:31:38,001 --> 01:31:40,610
I want that god damn
call in my... thank you.

1110
01:31:40,611 --> 01:31:44,574
- We had a deal but I'm changing the deal.
- Are you kidding me Sosa!

1111
01:31:44,575 --> 01:31:47,458
This is a complicated exchange
and you have no play here.

1112
01:31:47,459 --> 01:31:50,952
Listen, or remain at large
fugitives for the foreseeable future.

1113
01:31:51,173 --> 01:31:53,798
- No, no no no.
- I've got Morrison here with the plates!

1114
01:31:53,998 --> 01:31:55,994
I'm exposed Sosa, exposed!

1115
01:31:56,224 --> 01:31:57,550
We're not doing this on the docks.

1116
01:31:57,551 --> 01:32:00,154
Now listen to me, we're
not turning ourselves in.

1117
01:32:00,155 --> 01:32:01,860
Now you listen to me, we're
not turning ourselves in.

1118
01:32:01,861 --> 01:32:04,146
I need you to do it on my
terms, or nothing at all.

1119
01:32:04,147 --> 01:32:06,177
To hell with that, to hell with you Sosa!

1120
01:32:06,178 --> 01:32:07,622
Ahh... she burned him.

1121
01:32:07,623 --> 01:32:10,873
Face, B.A we're booking
out. Sosa shafted us.

1122
01:32:11,061 --> 01:32:14,682
Murdock, get the chopper down here in ten.

1123
01:32:15,238 --> 01:32:17,932
Okay, he's moving him you
got him, he's moving him.

1124
01:32:17,933 --> 01:32:20,064
For the love of god, relax.

1125
01:32:20,065 --> 01:32:21,790
I am relaxed, he's moving him.

1126
01:32:21,791 --> 01:32:24,432
Don't do this Hannibal, please.

1127
01:32:24,433 --> 01:32:25,350
There, that's Morrison
right there. Take him!

1128
01:32:25,351 --> 01:32:27,200
Vance!, does he have the plates?

1129
01:32:27,201 --> 01:32:28,350
Smith has the plates go now!

1130
01:32:28,351 --> 01:32:29,630
I've got Morrison taking the shot.

1131
01:32:33,244 --> 01:32:37,281
- A little too close for comfort kid.
- What just happened?

1132
01:32:37,381 --> 01:32:39,487
What the hell is he doing?

1133
01:32:39,642 --> 01:32:40,727
Where are they? Somebody talk to me.

1134
01:32:40,728 --> 01:32:44,313
Come on, did that thing
crush them or what?

1135
01:32:44,314 --> 01:32:48,104
Oh, this was a hell of a lot easier
when it was just three plastic cups.

1136
01:32:50,791 --> 01:32:54,907
Everybody just be cool, pay
attention, no hasty moves.

1137
01:32:55,394 --> 01:32:59,436
So you beat a guy like Lynch by
drawing him in with three things.

1138
01:32:59,674 --> 01:33:00,860
What the hell are they doing?

1139
01:33:00,861 --> 01:33:04,722
Distraction

1140
01:33:04,723 --> 01:33:05,722
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1141
01:33:05,723 --> 01:33:08,037
What is happening?

1142
01:33:09,333 --> 01:33:11,607
Diversion.

1143
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:18,165
This is a diversion stay
eagle on those containers.

1144
01:33:18,166 --> 01:33:19,384
They're making for the exits, open fire!

1145
01:33:19,385 --> 01:33:22,660
- Do not engage! Back off!
- All teams engage.

1146
01:33:26,601 --> 01:33:28,448
Holy shit!

1147
01:33:33,449 --> 01:33:36,000
You are being played
by Smith. He's trying to

1148
01:33:36,001 --> 01:33:38,691
draw your eye line
Lynch. Come on, be smart.

1149
01:33:38,692 --> 01:33:40,984
Take him, take him, take him!

1150
01:33:42,553 --> 01:33:46,999
Contact! Tower house and
bow. It's Peck and Baracus!

1151
01:33:52,426 --> 01:33:55,075
And evasion.

1152
01:33:55,575 --> 01:33:59,400
It's a trap! Pull back! Fall
back! Get the hell out of there!

1153
01:33:59,401 --> 01:34:00,657
No, no, no

1154
01:34:05,688 --> 01:34:08,216
What is happening? What is going on?

1155
01:34:08,217 --> 01:34:09,993
Nice one kid.

1156
01:34:09,994 --> 01:34:12,796
- It's Peck and Baracus.
- Shoot the...

1157
01:34:12,896 --> 01:34:16,055
- Shut up I know what I'm doing.
- Okay paint-ballers, time to go pro.

1158
01:34:19,150 --> 01:34:22,140
BA, get to your secondary position.

1159
01:34:22,816 --> 01:34:26,800
Okay, game-changer... here's what
I think of your best laid plans.

1160
01:34:28,703 --> 01:34:34,000
Shit

1161
01:34:34,001 --> 01:34:35,839
Jesus Christ!!

1162
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:39,612
- So much for the grand scheme Smith.
- What the hell was that?

1163
01:34:39,712 --> 01:34:42,965
- Face, what the hell was that?
- I think this ships going to blow.

1164
01:34:42,966 --> 01:34:45,551
- He punched a hole in the hull!
- What about the plan?

1165
01:34:45,552 --> 01:34:48,139
Pike just blew up the
plan we are ad libbing!

1166
01:34:48,333 --> 01:34:51,245
- Bosco, get out of there!
- I'm going for Hannibal!

1167
01:34:51,263 --> 01:34:54,420
- Cover me, I'm going for those plates.
- Yes sir.

1168
01:34:57,050 --> 01:35:02,435
- The boat's going over get out of there!
- Face hang on!

1169
01:36:46,915 --> 01:36:51,954
Bosco, Pike's got the high ground
I'm running low on ammo man.

1170
01:37:02,950 --> 01:37:04,137
Shit!

1171
01:37:04,138 --> 01:37:09,503
How are you doing handsome? Shit
can you cycle that weapon, nice work.

1172
01:37:09,504 --> 01:37:12,650
Geez, close friends and bullets.
Where are they when you need them?

1173
01:37:15,945 --> 01:37:21,486
Don't take this too personally but uh...
look here, smile, and wait for the flash.

1174
01:37:24,038 --> 01:37:26,146
Baracus!

1175
01:37:35,723 --> 01:37:38,659
Bosco!

1176
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:51,890
Lynch.

1177
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,890
Lynch.

1178
01:38:01,891 --> 01:38:05,038
Come on Lynch.

1179
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:08,529
Lynch.

1180
01:38:11,530 --> 01:38:16,509
- Come on Smith, stop bullshitting.
- Come on Lynch.

1181
01:38:18,760 --> 01:38:24,221
Lynch... where am I?

1182
01:38:26,868 --> 01:38:29,753
Come on Lynch.

1183
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:31,753
Lynch.

1184
01:38:32,754 --> 01:38:34,753
Where am I Lynch!

1185
01:38:37,754 --> 01:38:40,753
Lynch... Lynch... Lynch Lynch... Lynch.

1186
01:38:42,300 --> 01:38:44,753
Lynch!!

1187
01:38:57,754 --> 01:39:02,264
There you are Hannibal. I've
been looking all over for you.

1188
01:39:02,265 --> 01:39:05,229
Hey, don't let the scarf fool
you. My Muay Thai is pretty good.

1189
01:39:05,230 --> 01:39:08,961
Jujitsu's a little better
but I got this whole...

1190
01:39:09,281 --> 01:39:13,420
slight of hand thing going with
the containers and the cars...

1191
01:39:13,421 --> 01:39:16,033
and the fireworks. Lynch, Lynch, Lynch.

1192
01:39:16,034 --> 01:39:21,530
God that's annoying. But
you give Pike a rocket...

1193
01:39:21,531 --> 01:39:25,170
there's your monkey wrench.

1194
01:39:25,171 --> 01:39:26,967
Hannibal don't do this.

1195
01:39:27,320 --> 01:39:30,236
You know Smith, you could have
the best recipe in the world.

1196
01:39:30,237 --> 01:39:33,719
- You owe me that much.
- But you drop a few bullets in the batter.

1197
01:39:33,720 --> 01:39:34,800
- Hannibal don't do this.
- Lynch, no!

1198
01:39:39,058 --> 01:39:41,824
And that cake don't bake.

1199
01:39:42,275 --> 01:39:46,216
Uh oh, your witness,
your gun... your problem.

1200
01:39:47,951 --> 01:39:53,601
You served your country well. Excuse me.

1201
01:39:55,426 --> 01:39:59,417
Ahh hello Ben. Where
have you been all my life?

1202
01:40:01,606 --> 01:40:04,793
Hannibal, you're slowing down,

1203
01:40:04,794 --> 01:40:09,068
and bleeding, you're bleeding?
Da da da don't get up.

1204
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,140
God damn it!

1205
01:40:17,141 --> 01:40:20,828
Your Muay Thai is as bad
as your Jujitsu Lynch.

1206
01:40:22,267 --> 01:40:24,394
You better stick with a gun.

1207
01:40:24,429 --> 01:40:28,339
You put a loaded weapon in my hand.
I'm going to put a bullet in your head.

1208
01:40:43,126 --> 01:40:45,201
I told you I would shoot you.

1209
01:40:45,912 --> 01:40:48,566
Kevlar saved your life. The thing is...

1210
01:40:48,567 --> 01:40:50,746
doesn't do much good if
I pop you in the head.

1211
01:40:50,747 --> 01:40:54,538
It does if you melt it down.

1212
01:40:54,756 --> 01:40:57,742
Hannibal don't do this. Hannibal please.

1213
01:40:57,903 --> 01:41:00,860
See you beat a guy like that by
drawing him in with three things.

1214
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:03,274
- Distraction.
- Whoa whoa what is happening?

1215
01:41:03,374 --> 01:41:07,348
- Diversion.
- Division.

1216
01:41:10,869 --> 01:41:14,998
And you put him on display
for the whole world to see.

1217
01:41:31,929 --> 01:41:34,256
That's good.

1218
01:41:34,997 --> 01:41:38,268
Surprise.

1219
01:41:38,463 --> 01:41:41,933
- Agent Burris.
- What did you call me?

1220
01:41:42,883 --> 01:41:44,369
Agent Vance Burris isn't that your name?

1221
01:41:44,370 --> 01:41:47,957
At least that's the name I've got
on this warrant here. Unless you have

1222
01:41:47,958 --> 01:41:52,572
a piece of paper that
looks exactly like...

1223
01:41:52,582 --> 01:41:55,330
No, that wouldn't help you either.

1224
01:41:55,365 --> 01:41:57,567
Easy, easy.

1225
01:41:58,758 --> 01:42:02,494
You're under arrest for attempted murder
violations of the civil false claims act

1226
01:42:02,594 --> 01:42:06,977
and theft of top secret
government engraving plates.

1227
01:42:09,808 --> 01:42:13,700
Well I guess the plan went okay.
Considering Pike didn't blow up the boat

1228
01:42:13,701 --> 01:42:15,870
which I didn't account for at all.

1229
01:42:15,871 --> 01:42:18,158
The bullets didn't go through.

1230
01:42:19,977 --> 01:42:25,556
- How are you feeling man?
- Not... not good... not good.

1231
01:42:25,918 --> 01:42:27,579
I feel sane.

1232
01:42:27,580 --> 01:42:30,685
I should have shot you in
the head a long time ago.

1233
01:42:30,686 --> 01:42:34,808
Okay Agent Burris, that will be
all. Take him out of here guys.

1234
01:42:38,963 --> 01:42:44,139
What's the difference between
a concussion, and a contusion?

1235
01:42:44,998 --> 01:42:49,458
Murdock that was beautiful, you were right.
The helmet worked, ketchup worked great.

1236
01:42:49,708 --> 01:42:52,609
You did a great job are you okay?

1237
01:42:52,643 --> 01:42:57,786
Got your bell rung? Just let
Hannibal make the plans next time.

1238
01:42:58,166 --> 01:43:02,237
- Oh... Okay.
- How's the conscience big guy?

1239
01:43:02,311 --> 01:43:06,501
At peace.

1240
01:43:19,198 --> 01:43:22,162
- Which one of you is Sosa?
- I am.

1241
01:43:22,811 --> 01:43:25,412
As of right now, your prisoner is
to be remanded into federal custody.

1242
01:43:25,445 --> 01:43:27,776
- I have a warrant for this man's arrest.
- As of right now...

1243
01:43:27,876 --> 01:43:30,989
I'm a doctor, I'm going to help
you out. Hey you need stitches?

1244
01:43:31,477 --> 01:43:33,557
Please tell me you need stitches.
I could stitch you up really good.

1245
01:43:35,538 --> 01:43:37,672
Gentlemen.

1246
01:43:38,602 --> 01:43:42,270
Central Intelligence Agency believes
in and invensys a crown moral ethic

1247
01:43:42,271 --> 01:43:44,551
as well as an unshakable
professional standard.

1248
01:43:44,552 --> 01:43:50,645
As such, we would like to extend our most
sincere apologies for what's happened here.

1249
01:43:51,134 --> 01:43:54,995
- Good day and god bless.
- Where are you taking him?

1250
01:43:57,104 --> 01:43:59,615
Who?

1251
01:44:02,941 --> 01:44:05,659
I never got your name.

1252
01:44:06,601 --> 01:44:12,183
- My name in Lynch.
- Of course it is.

1253
01:44:14,228 --> 01:44:16,918
Did he just say Lynch.

1254
01:44:29,388 --> 01:44:31,725
- Easy guys.
- Everybody, stand down.

1255
01:44:33,048 --> 01:44:35,939
Control this place.

1256
01:44:38,892 --> 01:44:42,156
When did you arrive I had no idea...

1257
01:44:42,176 --> 01:44:44,080
Yes sir.

1258
01:44:44,506 --> 01:44:47,640
Get your hands off me tough guy.

1259
01:44:49,244 --> 01:44:53,517
Well that's one hell of a
mess. But we did get the plates.

1260
01:44:53,844 --> 01:44:58,189
But unfortunately, I'm going to have to
charge you all with escaping lawful custody.

1261
01:44:58,224 --> 01:45:00,115
What?! Hannibal what is
this guy talking about?

1262
01:45:00,215 --> 01:45:03,225
We were wrongly convicted but it's
still illegal to break out of jail.

1263
01:45:03,226 --> 01:45:06,239
Director, Smith and his men were
instrumental in recovering the plates.

1264
01:45:06,240 --> 01:45:10,161
They're still level ten fugitives
and I need that off my desk.

1265
01:45:10,162 --> 01:45:12,090
This is chicken shit sir.

1266
01:45:12,481 --> 01:45:15,306
Well perhaps for them, it is chicken
shit, but for you... Captain...

1267
01:45:15,307 --> 01:45:17,889
we're re-promoting you
to your former rank.

1268
01:45:17,890 --> 01:45:20,960
So look, they're going to be delivered
to the US Marshalls here in Long Beach,

1269
01:45:20,984 --> 01:45:26,869
- I understand sir but...
- This needs to be done!

1270
01:45:27,092 --> 01:45:29,575
I'm a Harry Houdini.

1271
01:45:33,352 --> 01:45:35,833
- Let's go keep moving.
- Stop, wait.

1272
01:45:37,096 --> 01:45:40,486
- This is so wrong.
- Don't worry about it.

1273
01:45:40,647 --> 01:45:42,778
I'm going to do
everything I can to fix it.

1274
01:45:43,006 --> 01:45:47,124
- I know you will.
- I'm so sorry Face.

1275
01:46:18,336 --> 01:46:22,218
Nice plan Face.

1276
01:46:22,321 --> 01:46:26,275
Yeah, we just traded Lynches
and we're going back to prison.

1277
01:46:26,276 --> 01:46:29,288
We returned the plates, we can hold
our heads high, we did the right thing.

1278
01:46:29,289 --> 01:46:32,829
Yeah after what they did
to us. This is bullshit.

1279
01:46:32,929 --> 01:46:37,228
They burned us again Hannibal. We
trusted the system and it turned on us.

1280
01:46:37,666 --> 01:46:41,132
Remember boys, no matter how random
things might appear, there is still a plan.

1281
01:46:41,133 --> 01:46:45,208
Kid...

1282
01:46:45,209 --> 01:46:48,537
Well, I don't mean to steal
your line boss, but uh...

1283
01:46:53,821 --> 01:46:58,647
I love it when a plan comes together.

1284
01:47:04,849 --> 01:47:08,389
They survived as soldiers of fortune.

1285
01:47:09,318 --> 01:47:11,602
If you have a problem.

1286
01:47:12,475 --> 01:47:14,520
If no one else can help.

1287
01:47:15,074 --> 01:47:18,859
And if you can find
them, maybe you can hire.

1288
01:47:18,959 --> 01:47:24,215
The A-Team.

1289
01:47:24,216 --> 01:47:44,217
