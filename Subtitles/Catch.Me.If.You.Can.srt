JOE GARAGIOLA:
Thank you very much

26
00:03:08,805 --> 00:03:10,306
and welcome
toTo Tell the Truth.

27
00:03:10,306 --> 00:03:12,308
Our first guest,
he's made a career

28
00:03:12,308 --> 00:03:14,310
out of being
the most outrageous impostor

29
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,312
that we've ever come across
on this show

30
00:03:16,312 --> 00:03:18,314
and you're going to see
what I mean.

31
00:03:18,314 --> 00:03:21,317
ANNOUNCER:
Number One,
what is your name, please?

32
00:03:21,317 --> 00:03:23,319
My name is
Frank William Abagnale.

33
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,320
Number Two?

34
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,823
My name is
Frank William Abagnale.

35
00:03:26,823 --> 00:03:28,324
Number Three?

36
00:03:28,324 --> 00:03:30,326
My name is
Frank William Abagnale.

37
00:03:30,326 --> 00:03:34,547
GARAGIOLA:
"From 1964 to 1967,
I successfully impersonated

38
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:37,050
"an airline pilot
for Pan Am Airways

39
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,553
"and I flew over
two million miles for free.

40
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:44,057
"During that time, I was also
the chief resident pediatrician

41
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,059
"at a Georgia hospital

42
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,061
"and an assistant
attorney general

43
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,562
"for the State of Louisiana.

44
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,065
"By the time I was caught,
I was considered

45
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:55,068
"the youngest and most daring
con man in U.S. history.

46
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:58,571
"I had cashed almost $4 million
in fraudulent checks

47
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:02,075
"in 26 foreign countries
and all 50 states.

48
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:05,578
"And I did it all
before my 19th birthday.

49
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:08,581
My name is
Frank William Abagnale."

50
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,583
? You don't know how
to tell the truth... ?

51
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,584
(applause)

52
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,586
? You don't know how
to tell the truth... ?

53
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:14,587
So, for the first time

54
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,089
he's going to have
to tell the truth

55
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,591
and we're going to start
our questioning with Kitty.

56
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,094
Thank you. Number One,
why, with all your talent--

57
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,596
and you're obviously
a very bright fellow--

58
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,099
why didn't you go in
for a legitimate profession?

59
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,601
It was really a question
of dollars and cents.

60
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,104
When I was a young man,
I needed the money

61
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,106
and I thought
this list of careers

62
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,607
was the easiest way to get it.

63
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,109
I see.

64
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,611
Number Two, I find this all
very fascinating.

65
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,113
Who was it
that finally caught you?

66
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,615
His name was Carl Hanratty.

67
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,617
(French accent):
Han-an-an-ratty.

68
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,618
Ratty.

69
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,120
(American accent):
Hanratty.

70
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,121
Han-ratty.

71
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,623
Carl Hanratty.

72
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,125
Yes. I...

73
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,627
am... Carl Hanratty.

74
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:59,132
I represent the FBI from
the United States of America.

75
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,633
(speaking French)

76
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,635
Yeah. I have orders

77
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,138
to see the American
prisoner, Abagnale.

78
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:09,142
(man translating
English into French)

(thunder rumbling outside)

85
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,668
You sit here.

86
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,671
You do not open the door.

87
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:42,175
You do not pass him...

88
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,678
anything through the hole.

89
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:49,182

(retching)

100

You know, I've got
a little bit of a cold myself.

101
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,214
Frank... (coughing)

102
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,716
I'm here to read
the articles of extradition

103
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:26,219
according to the
European Court for Human Rights.

104

Help me.

112

you can fool me, do you?

Don't sweat it, Frank.

right to a doctor.

Frank, if you can
hear me, don't worry.

132
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,776
I'm going to take you
home in the morning.

morning, Frank.

What are you doing?

Washing off the lice.

137
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,787
This man has to be on a plane
for America.

138
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:35,788
He has to see a doctor.

139
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,790
The doctor comes in
tomorrow.

140
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,792
I have worked too long,
too hard

141
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,794
for you to take
this away from me.

142

you responsible.

has a history
that goes back to 1919.

160

In all those years

161
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:56,369
we've only seen a handful
of deserving gentlemen

162
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,871
inducted as lifetime members.

163
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,873
It's an honor that, uh

164
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:05,878
that has seen 57 names enshrined
on the wall of honor

165
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,381
and tonight, we make it 58.

166
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,884
So please stand as I present
my very good friend

167
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,387
a man who keeps
our pencils sharp...

168
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,888
(scattered chuckling)

169
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,890
and our pens in ink--

170
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,393
Frank William Abagnale.

171
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,401
(crowd whistling)

172
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,413
(mike feedback whines)

173
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,914
I stand here humbled

174
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,917
by the presence
of Mayor Robert Wagner...

175
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:49,422
(applause)

176
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,425
...and our club president,
Jack Barnes.

177
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,428
(applause)

178
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,430
(whistling)

179
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:01,434
Most of all, I'm honored to see
my loving wife Paula...

180
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:07,440
...and my son, Frank Jr.--

181
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,442
Frank... Aw, stand up.
Come on--

182
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,948
(feedback whining):
...sitting in the front row.

183
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,451
(laughter)

184
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:25,458
Two little mice fell
in a bucket of cream.

185
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:29,962
The first mouse quickly gave up
and drowned.

186
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:34,467
The second mouse...
wouldn't quit.

187
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,968
He struggled so hard

188
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:39,472
that eventually he churned
that cream into butter

189
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,474
and crawled out.

190
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:45,978
Gentlemen, as of this moment,
I am that second mouse.

191
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:49,982
(laughter and enthusiastic
applause)

192
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:02,995
("Embraceable You" playing
on record player)

193
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,998
PAULA:
You're a better dancer
than your father, Frankie.

194
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,500
You hear that, Daddy?

195
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,501
FRANK SR.:
Like fun.

196
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,503
PAULA:
The girls don't know
what they're in for.

197
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,506
Show him the dance
you were doing when we met.

198
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,007
Ah, who can
remember?

199
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,510
The people
in that little French village

200
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,512
were so happy
to see Americans

201
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,014
they decided
to put on a show for us.

202
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,016
So they crammed
200 soldiers...

203
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,018
Yeah, we know
the story, Daddy.

204
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,520
...into that
tiny social hall

205
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,022
and the first person
to walk onstage

206
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,525
is your mother, and
she starts to dance.

207
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,026
You know

208
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:37,863
it had been months
since we'd even seen a woman

209
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,865
and here's
this blonde angel.

210
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,367
Blonde bombshell.

211
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,868
(giggles)

212
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:46,372
And the men are literally
holding their breath.

213
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,873
Holding their
breath for you.

214
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:48,874
You hear that?

215
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:49,875
(giggles)

216
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:50,876
Mm-hmm.

217
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,379
And I turned to my buddies
and I said...

218
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,381
"I will not leave
France without her."

219
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,882
And I didn't.

220
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,384
You didn't.

221
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,386
I didn't.

222
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,387
(liquid spills)

223
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,389
Oh, shit!
Oh, shit, the rug!

224
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,390
Aw, Mom...

225
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,891
I can't believe
I did that.

226
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,393
No, no, it's nothing.
It's nothing.

227
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,894
Oh, Frankie, Frankie,
get a towel.

228
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:09,895
Paula...
Yeah, yeah.

229
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:10,896
Come on.

230
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:14,400
? My sweet embraceable you... ?

231
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,402
Dance with me, Paula.

232
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,407
Ah... (giggles)

233
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:27,413
(instrumental interlude
playing)

234
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,415
Whenever I dance for you

235
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,417
I get in trouble.

236
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,425
(mouthing):
Watch this.

237
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,427
(chuckles)

238
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,180
Oh! (laughs)

239
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,431
Frank! Wake up.

240
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,932
Come on, let's go!

241
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,934
Get up.
Come on, come on.

242
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,436
Frank, wake up.

243
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,437
(groans):
Dad...

244
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,439
You don't have to go
to school today.

245
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,940
It's okay.

246
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,442
Why? Is it snowing?

247
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,943
Do you have
a black suit?

248
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,945
I overslept again, huh?

249
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:03,449
We have a very important
meeting in the city.

250
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,950
Eat that.
Come on, come on, eat.

251
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,952
Ma'am, open up.
Just open up, please!

252
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:07,953
Ma'am?
It's important.

253
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:08,954
What?

254
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,456
Oh, gosh!

255
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,957
We don't open
for half an hour!

256
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,959
Open the door, please.
Just open the door.

257
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:14,960
It's important.

258
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,962
I-I'm sorry, we don't open
for half an hour.

259
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:17,963
What's your name, ma'am?

260
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:18,964
Darcy.

261
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:19,965
Darcy.
That's a pretty name.

262
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,967
I'm in a bit of a fix.
I need a suit for my kid.

263
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:22,968
This is my son Frank.

264
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:23,969
Oh, hi.

265
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:24,970
He needs a black suit.

266
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,472
Black suit...

267
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,973
There was a death
in the family.

268
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,475
My father, 85 years old,
war hero.

269
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,477
Yeah?

270
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,979
There's a funeral
this afternoon, military funeral

271
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,981
planes flying overhead,
21-gun salute.

272
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,483
Geez.

273
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,485
Frank needs
to borrow a suit

274
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,486
for a couple
of hours.

275
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,489
I'm sorry, we don't loan suits,
and we're not open.

276
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,990
Darcy... Darcy, please.

277
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,992
(sighs) Come back.

278
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,994
Darcy... is this yours?

279
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,996
(jingles)

280
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,503
I just found it
in the parking lot.

281
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,505
Uh-huh.

282
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,007
It must've slipped
right off your neck.

283
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,010
(tires screeching)

284
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,012
Don't hit the curb.

285
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:11,016
(brakes squeaking)

286
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,519
Now get out,
walk around the back

287
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,521
and hold the door open
for me.

288
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,526
(car horn honks)

289
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,031
All right.

290
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,533
What's next?

291
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,034
Okay, stop grinning.

292
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:32,538
When I get inside, you go back
to the front seat and wait.

293
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,040
Even if a cop comes
and writes you a ticket

294
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,042
you don't move the car,
understood?

295
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,044
Dad, wha-what's
all this for?

296
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,046
You know why the Yankees
always win, Frank?

297
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,548
'Cause they have
Mickey Mantle?

298
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,550
No, it's 'cause
the other teams

299
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,052
can't stop staring
at those damn pinstripes.

300
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,053
Watch this.

301
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,555
The manager
of Chase Manhattan Bank

302
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:54,059
is about to open the
door for your father.

303
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,063
Mr. Abagnale, um

304
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,566
we don't usually
loan money to people

305
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,568
who have unresolved business
with the IRS.

306
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,570
That's a
misunderstanding.

307
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,572
I hired the wrong
guy to do my books.

308
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,073
A mistake, I...
anybody could make it.

309
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,576
I just need you
guys to help me
weather the storm.

310
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,078
Sir, you're being investigated
by the government

311
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,080
for tax fraud.

312
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,082
My store is a landmark
in New Rochelle.

313
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:19,084
I have customers
all over New York.

314
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,587
Well, you're not a customer
at Chase Manhattan.

315
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:22,588
We don't know you.

316
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,590
I'm sure your bank
in New Rochelle

317
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,592
they know you,
they could help you out.

318
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,093
My bank went
out of business.

319
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,596
Banks like this one put
them out of business.

320
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,598
Now, I know I made a
mistake, I admit that

321
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,099
but these people want blood.

322
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,100
They want my store.

323
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,102
They've threatened
to put me in jail.

324
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,104
(stammers)

325
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,606
This is America, right?

326
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,607
I'm not a criminal.

327
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,108
I'm a Medal of Honor winner

328
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,611
a lifetime member
of the New Rochelle Rotary Club.

329
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,614
All I'm asking is for you
to help me beat these guys.

330
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:51,617
It's not a question
of winning and losing.

331
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,118
It's a question of risk.

332
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,621
You're the largest
bank in the world.

333
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,122
Where's the fu...

334
00:15:57,122 --> 00:16:00,125
Whe... Where's the risk?

335
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,133
Dad, how could you just let him
take our car like that?

336
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,135
He didn't take anything.
We took him.

337
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,136
He overpaid by $500.

338
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:14,640
Come on, Frank.

339
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,141
Let's return the suit.

340
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,143
(Paula sobbing)

341
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,651
This place is good.

342
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,152
It's small but, you know

343
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,155
it's going to be
a lot less work.

344
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,657
A lot less work for you.

345
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,159
(jackhammer drilling
in distance)

346
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,670
(keys clank)

347
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,181
FRANK:
Hey, Dad.

348
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,183
Hi.

349
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,689
Where's your mother?

350
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:04,690
I don't know.

351
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:09,194
She said something
about going to look for a job.

352
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:11,697
What's she gonna be

353
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,699
a shoe salesman
at a centipede farm?

354
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:14,700
(laughing)

355
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,703
(both laughing)

356
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,206
What are you doing?

357
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,708
(both laughing)

358
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,210
You want some pancakes?

359
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,211
For dinner?

360
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,213
On my son's
16th birthday?

361
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,215
We're not gonna
eat pancakes.

362
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,220
Come on, why are you
looking at me like that?

363
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,722
You thought I forgot?

364
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,725
I didn't think you forgot.
I opened a
checking account

365
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,727
in your name.

366
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:42,728
I put $25 in the account

367
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,730
so you can buy
whatever you want.

368
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,231
Don't tell your mother.

369
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,232
I won't.

370
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,233
Thanks, Dad.

371
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,234
Yep.

372
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:52,488
Didn't that bank turn you down
for a loan, though?

373
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,239
Yes, they all
turned me down.

374
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,741
(chuckles)

375
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,743
Then why you opening a
banking account with them?

376
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,245
Well, because one day,
you'll want something

377
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,247
from these people--
a house, a car.

378
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:05,250
They have all the money.

379
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,756
There's 50 checks
there, Frank

380
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:15,260
which means, from
this day on...

381
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,763
you're in their
little club.

382
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:21,266
I'm in their little club.

383
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,268
You got that,
you got it all.

384
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:27,773
It's even got
my name there, huh?

385
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:28,774
To the moon.

386
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,776
To the moon!

387
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,779
To the moon.

388
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,781
(bells tolling)

389
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,290
See that?
It's just a school.

390
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,792
No different
than Westbourne.

391
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:50,796
Ma... you said you were
going to quit.

392
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,302
Frankie, you don't have
to wear the uniform here.

393
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:00,305
Why don't you take
off your jacket?

394
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:03,308
I'm used to it.

395
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,310
(indistinct conversation)

396
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:08,814
Excuse me.

397
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:09,815
Oh, yes?

398
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,817
Do you know where
room 17 French is?

399
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,819
GIRL:
Yeah, it's...

400
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,320
(snickering)

401
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,827
(school bell ringing)

402
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,829
BOY:
But you frickin'
killed him.

403
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:27,332
(loud indistinct conversation)

404
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,334
You selling
encyclopedias?

405
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:32,838
Yeah, he looks like
a substitute teacher.

406
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,348
(boy laughing)

407
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:47,853
(loud conversation
and laughter continues)

408
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,855
Quiet down, people!

409
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,357
My name is Mr. Abagnale!

410
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:55,527
That's Abagnale,
not Abagnahlee

411
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:59,031
not Abagnaylee,
but Abagnale!

412
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,033
Now, somebody please
tell me where you left off

413
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,035
in your textbooks.

414
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,538
Excuse me, people,
if I need to ask again

415
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,040
I'm going to write up
the entire class.

416
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,542
Take your seats!

417
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,048
Chapter seven.

418
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,550
Will you please open your
textbooks to, uh, chapter eight

419
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,053
and we'll get started?

420
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,554
Excuse me,
what's your name?

421
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:23,555
Brad.

422
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,057
Brad, why don't you
get up here

423
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,059
in front of the class here

424
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,562
and read conversation
number five?

425
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:36,068
(pronouncing poorly):
"Les Francais sonts

426
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,070
"uh, generalement

427
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,572
(students laughing)
"dans leur pais que...

428
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:43,575
presque tout le monde
a cette impression..."

429
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,077
They sent for me.

430
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:48,080
They said they needed
a sub for Roberta.

431
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,083
I came all the way
from-from Dixon.

432
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,085
Well, uh,
I always sub for Roberta.

433
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,587
Excuse me,
why aren't you reading?

434
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:56,588
(continues reading)

435
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:59,591
I'll never come back to-to
Bellarmine Jefferson again!

436
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,094
(students laughing)
You tell them not to call me!

437
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,596
What do they think,
it's easy for a woman my age

438
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,598
and all the money that it costs
to travel?

439
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,600
I tell you,
they don't give a damn.

440
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,601
(students laughing)

441
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,103
Mr. and Mrs. Abagnale

442
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:14,606
this is not a question
of your son's attendance.

443
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:17,609
I regret to inform you that,
for the past week

444
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:21,113
Frank has been teaching
Mrs. Glasser's French class.

445
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,116
He what?

446
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:28,120
Your son has been pretending
to be a substitute teacher

447
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:32,624
lecturing the students,
uh, giving out homework.

448
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:36,128
Mrs. Glasser has
been ill and there was

449
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,131
some confusion
with the real sub.

450
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:42,634
Your son held a teacher-parent
conference yesterday

451
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:45,137
and was planning
a class field trip

452
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,639
to a French bread factory
in Trenton.

453
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:51,143
Do you see the problem we have?

454
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,145
Yeah.
Mrs. Davenport?

455
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,647
Uh, I have a note
to miss fifth and
sixth period today.

456
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:56,648
Doctor's appointment.

457
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,650
One moment.
(phone ringing)

458
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,152
I'll be right with you.

459
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,153
(whispering):
Hey...

460
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,154
MRS. DAVENPORT:
Yes?

461
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,155
You should fold it.

462
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,656
What?

463
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,158
That note.
It's a fake, right?

464
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,659
You should fold it.

465
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,161
It's... It's a note
from my mom.

466
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,163
I have a doctor's
appointment.

467
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,665
Yeah, but there's
no crease in the paper.

468
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,168
When your mom hands
you a note to miss school

469
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,669
the first thing you do is,
you fold it

470
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,171
and you put it
in your pocket.

471
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:22,174
I mean, if it's real,
where's the crease?

472
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,181
-(school bell ringing)
-(door opens)

473
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,185
(quietly):
Frankie.

474
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:47,699
(both chuckling quietly)

475
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,203
Ma, I'm home.

476
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,205
(romantic music
plays on record player)

477
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,207
Oh, you remember
that girl Joanna

478
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,209
I was telling you about?

479
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:00,212
I asked her out today.

480
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,714
Think we're going to go
to the Junior Prom.

481
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,716
(record scratches,
music stops)

482
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,718
Ma, is this
my driver's license?

483
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,220
That's all there is,
two bedrooms.

484
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,722
Oh, Frankie.

485
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,724
You remember
Dad's friend?

486
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,726
Jack Barnes?

487
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,228
From the club.

488
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,229
Hello.

489
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,231
He came by looking
for your father.

490
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,733
I was giving him
a tour of the apartment.

491
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,736
It's very, uh, uh,
spacious, Paula.

492
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,744
Dad's at the store.

493
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:35,747
So, Frank... you're
getting to look

494
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:38,750
more like your
old man every day.

495
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,755
Thanks for the
sandwich, Paula.

496
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,257
I'll see you later, eh?

497
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,259
Wait.

498
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,765
Is this yours?

499
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:56,268
Oh.

500
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,270
Well, thanks, Frank.

501
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,772
Uh, that's
the President's pin.

502
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:03,275
I'd be in deep trouble
if I lost that.

503
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,279
(nervous chuckle)

504
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,283
I'll see you all
later, eh?

505
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,794
Are you hungry, Frankie?

506
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:25,297
I'll make you a sandwich.

507
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:36,308
Jack wanted to talk business
with your father.

508
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,810
He thinks we should
get a lawyer

509
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,812
and sue the government.

510
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:45,317
That is not legal,
what they're doing to us.

511
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,322
Why aren't you
saying anything?

512
00:24:56,828 --> 00:25:01,333
You're not going
to tell him... are you?

513
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,834
(quietly):
No.

514
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,336
That's right.

515
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,838
There's nothing to tell.

516
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,840
I'm going out
for a few hours

517
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,843
to visit some old friends
from the tennis club and...

518
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:15,347
when I get home, we'll all
have dinner together.

519
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,349
Right?

520
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,851
But you won't
say anything

521
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:22,854
because it's...
it's just silly, isn't it?

522
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,856
How could
we sue anybody?

523
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:33,365
Oh... do you need
some money, Frankie?

524
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:37,369
A few dollars to buy
some record albums?

525
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:40,372
Here, take five dollars.

526
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,374
Or-Or ten.

527
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,881
You promised you
were going to quit.

528
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:51,883
(slams)

529
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:58,390
(children laughing)

530
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,892
(dog barking in distance)

531
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,403
Ma, I'm home!

532
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,415
(door opens)

533
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,919
Hey, hey!

534
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,421
You... You stay away from me,
hear me?

535
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,922
You stay away from me--
I don't know who you are

536
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,424
but if you ever
come back here again--

537
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,426
Frankie! Frank, Frank,
calm down, will you?

538
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:35,927
I'm Dick Kesner.

539
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,929
Now, I want you
to leave your things here

540
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:40,432
and follow me
into the next room, okay?

541
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,933
They're all waiting for you.

542
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,938
PAULA:
You don't have
to be scared.

543
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,940
I'm right here, Frank.
I'll always be here.

544
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,942
But there are laws.

545
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,944
Everything in this
country has to be legal.

546
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:55,947
So what we need to do
is make some decisions.

547
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,949
That's what Mr. Kesner
is here for.

548
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,951
Many times these decisions
are left up to the courts

549
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:01,453
but that can be
very expensive, Frank

550
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,455
people fighting
over their children.

551
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,956
Nobody is fighting.

552
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:07,459
Look at me, Frank.
Nobody is fighting.

553
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,961
(speaking French)

554
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:12,464
(quietly):
Dad, what's going on?

555
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,965
Dad, what's going on?

556
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:16,468
(speaking French continues)

557
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,303
Do you remember
your grandma, Eve?

558
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,804
She arrived this morning.

559
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,306
(speaks French)

560
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,807
Hello.

561
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:34,319
Do you understand what
we're saying to you, Frank?

562
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:39,824
Your father and I
are getting a divorce.

563
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,827
(speaking French)

564
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:43,828
Nothing's gonna change.

565
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:45,330
We're still gonna
see each other.

566
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,332
Stop it, please, Frank.
Don't interrupt.

567
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,834
Frank, you don't
have to read all of this.

568
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:52,837
Most of it's for your parents--
boring adult business--

569
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:55,840
but this paragraph right here,
this is important

570
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,343
because it states
who you're gonna live with...

571
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,345
after the divorce...

572
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,347
whose custody you will be in.

573
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:05,850
And there's a blank space
right here.

574
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:06,851
(Eve speaking French)

575
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:08,353
And I want you to go
into the kitchen

576
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,854
sit at the table

577
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:11,356
and put a name down.

578
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,857
You can take
as long as you want

579
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,359
but when you come back
into this room...

580
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,861
I want to see a name
on that line.

581
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:20,865
Frank, just write down a name
and this will all be over.

582
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,867
It's gonna be okay.

583
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:24,369
FRANK:
Dad, what name?

584
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,870
Your mother or
your father.

585
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,872
Just put the name there.
It's as simple as that.

586
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:30,875
And don't look so scared.

587
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,877
It's not a test.

588
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,879
There's no wrong answer.

589
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:40,385
(man announcing trains
 indistinctly)

590
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:47,392
(melancholy jazz playing)

591
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,393
Hi.

592
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,894
(panting)

593
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,396
One ticket to Grand
Central, please.

594
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:54,399
That'll be $3.50, sir.

595
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,402
Is it okay
if I write you a check?

596
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:05,410
Carl, when do I get
to call my father?

597
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,912
You can call him when
we get to New York.

598
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:11,416
We leave for the airport
in seven hours.

599
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,418
Until then, just sit there.

600
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:16,421
Be quiet.

601
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:18,423
You know, Carl,
on the other side of the hotel

602
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,425
they got suites
that face the park.

603
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:24,929
It's the best room
the FBI can afford.

604
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,933
It's okay, I've stayed in worse.

605
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:30,435
Mr. Mudrick...

606
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,936
Mr. Mudrick, please.
You have to listen.

607
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,438
I don't want to
hear your story.

608
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:35,440
This is two checks
that bounced.

609
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,442
You know how much
trouble I'm in?

610
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,943
No, but listen,
I'm telling you

611
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:39,944
the bank,
they made the mistake.

612
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:41,946
I'll write you
another check right now!

613
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,448
What, do I look like
I was born yesterday?

614
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,450
Look, it's midnight,
Mr. Mudrick.

615
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,451
Where am I gonna go?

616
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,952
You're a goddamn kid.

617
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,455
Go home.

618
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:54,459
(baby crying in distance)

619
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:16,981
? ?

620
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:29,327
? ?

621
00:30:37,785 --> 00:30:39,287
I mean, I hope
you understand.

622
00:30:39,287 --> 00:30:40,788
My boss sent me to Brooklyn,
then Queens.

623
00:30:40,788 --> 00:30:42,290
Now he wants me
in Long Island

624
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:44,792
to take a few clients out
for a night on the town.

625
00:30:44,792 --> 00:30:46,794
I'm sorry,
but we're not allowed

626
00:30:46,794 --> 00:30:48,296
to cash checks
from other banks.

627
00:30:48,296 --> 00:30:50,798
How would we know
if they were any good?

628
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:52,300
What did you say
your name was?

629
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,301
Ashley.

630
00:30:53,301 --> 00:30:54,802
Ashley...

631
00:30:54,802 --> 00:30:56,804
you know what I found on
the sidewalk out there?

632
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:04,312
Must've slipped
right off your neck.

633
00:31:08,816 --> 00:31:12,820
Is there something
I can help you with, son?

634
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,822
Well, you see, it's my
grandmother's birthday next week

635
00:31:15,323 --> 00:31:17,325
and I want to get her
something extra-special.

636
00:31:17,325 --> 00:31:18,826
Please, I mean

637
00:31:18,826 --> 00:31:21,329
it's my midterm next week
and my books were stolen.

638
00:31:21,329 --> 00:31:22,330
(raspy coughing)

639
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:24,332
Please, it's just five dollars.

640
00:31:24,332 --> 00:31:25,833
No one would have to know.

641
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:28,336
I'm sorry,
but we are not allowed

642
00:31:28,836 --> 00:31:31,839
to take checks
from people we don't know.

643
00:31:40,848 --> 00:31:42,850
(horns honking,
whistle blowing)

644
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,863
? ?

645
00:32:05,373 --> 00:32:07,375
(women laughing)

646
00:32:13,881 --> 00:32:15,383
Pleasure to have you back,
Captain Carlson.

647
00:32:15,383 --> 00:32:16,884
What do you think, Angelo?

648
00:32:16,884 --> 00:32:18,386
The tomatoes are ripe
this afternoon.

649
00:32:18,886 --> 00:32:20,888
(women giggling)

650
00:32:26,394 --> 00:32:27,895
Well, what have we here?

651
00:32:27,895 --> 00:32:29,897
Can I have
your autograph?
You betcha.

652
00:32:29,897 --> 00:32:31,899
Can I have
your autograph, too?
You gonna be a pilot?

653
00:32:31,899 --> 00:32:33,901
Mm-hmm!
All right, then.

654
00:32:33,901 --> 00:32:35,403
There you go.
Work hard in school.

655
00:32:35,403 --> 00:32:36,904
FRANK:
Dear Dad:

656
00:32:36,904 --> 00:32:39,407
I have decided to become
an airline pilot.

657
00:32:39,407 --> 00:32:41,909
I have applied
to all the big airlines

658
00:32:41,909 --> 00:32:44,912
and I have several
promising interviews lined up.

659
00:32:44,912 --> 00:32:46,914
How's Mom?

660
00:32:46,914 --> 00:32:48,916
Have you called her lately?

661
00:32:48,916 --> 00:32:50,918
Love, your son, Frank.

662
00:32:54,422 --> 00:32:55,923
Hello.

663
00:32:55,923 --> 00:32:58,426
I'm Frank Black
from Murrow High School

664
00:32:58,426 --> 00:33:00,928
and I have an appointment
with Mr. Morgan.

665
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:02,430
You're the young man

666
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:04,432
who's writing the article
for the school paper.

667
00:33:04,432 --> 00:33:05,933
Yes, ma'am, that's me.
I want to know

668
00:33:05,933 --> 00:33:07,935
everything there is to know
about being a pilot.

669
00:33:07,935 --> 00:33:09,437
What airports
does Pan Am fly to?

670
00:33:09,437 --> 00:33:10,938
What does a pilot
make in a year?

671
00:33:10,938 --> 00:33:13,441
And who tells them where
they're gonna fly to?

672
00:33:13,441 --> 00:33:14,442
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down.

673
00:33:14,942 --> 00:33:15,943
Just take 'em
one at a time.

674
00:33:15,943 --> 00:33:16,944
All right.
What does it mean

675
00:33:16,944 --> 00:33:18,446
when one pilot says
to another pilot:

676
00:33:18,946 --> 00:33:20,448
"What kind of equipment
are you on?"

677
00:33:20,448 --> 00:33:22,950
They just want to
know what kind of
aircraft you're flying:

678
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:24,452
Is it a DC-8, 707,
Constellation?

679
00:33:24,452 --> 00:33:26,954
And what about those I.D. badges
that I've seen pilots wear?

680
00:33:26,954 --> 00:33:29,457
Well, every pilot has
to have two things
with him at all times:

681
00:33:29,957 --> 00:33:31,459
One is his airline
personnel badge--

682
00:33:31,459 --> 00:33:33,461
looks just like this
one here, from Pan Am--

683
00:33:33,461 --> 00:33:35,963
the other one is
their FAA license...

684
00:33:35,963 --> 00:33:38,466
and that looks
just like this.

685
00:33:38,466 --> 00:33:40,468
Oh. Sir, do you
think I can

686
00:33:40,468 --> 00:33:43,971
make a copy of this
to put into my article?

687
00:33:43,971 --> 00:33:45,973
Oh, Frank, you can
have that one.

688
00:33:45,973 --> 00:33:46,974
It's three
years expired.

689
00:33:46,974 --> 00:33:48,976
Aw, thanks!
And what about
your I.D. badge?

690
00:33:48,976 --> 00:33:50,478
You have an extra
one I could borrow?

691
00:33:50,478 --> 00:33:52,480
Oh, no, I can't help you there.

692
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,482
Those are special-ordered
from Polaroid.

693
00:33:54,482 --> 00:33:55,983
The only way
to get one of those

694
00:33:55,983 --> 00:33:58,486
is to become a real live pilot
for Pan American Airways.

695
00:33:58,486 --> 00:34:01,489
(dialing phone)

696
00:34:01,489 --> 00:34:02,990
(car horns honking,
whistle blowing)

697
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:04,992
WOMAN (over phone):
Pan Am, may I help you?

698
00:34:04,992 --> 00:34:06,494
FRANK (Southern accent):
Yeah, hello.

699
00:34:06,494 --> 00:34:07,495
I'm calling about a uniform.

700
00:34:07,495 --> 00:34:08,996
Hold for Purchasing.

701
00:34:08,996 --> 00:34:09,997
Thank you.

702
00:34:09,997 --> 00:34:11,499
WOMAN 2:
Purchasing.

703
00:34:11,499 --> 00:34:13,501
(Southern accent):
Hi. I'm a copilot

704
00:34:13,501 --> 00:34:15,002
based out of San Francisco.

705
00:34:15,002 --> 00:34:16,504
I flew a flight
into New York last night

706
00:34:16,504 --> 00:34:17,505
but the problem is

707
00:34:18,005 --> 00:34:19,507
I'm headed out to, uh, Paris
in three hours.

708
00:34:19,507 --> 00:34:21,008
How can we help you?

709
00:34:21,509 --> 00:34:24,512
I sent my uniform to be cleaned
through the hotel

710
00:34:24,512 --> 00:34:27,014
and I... I guess
they must have lost it.

711
00:34:27,014 --> 00:34:29,517
WOMAN 2:
They lost a uniform.
Happens all the time.

712
00:34:29,517 --> 00:34:31,519
Go down to the Well-Built
Uniform Company

713
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:32,520
at Ninth and Broadway.

714
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,021
They're our uniform supplier.

715
00:34:34,021 --> 00:34:35,523
I'll tell Mr. Rosen
you're coming.

716
00:34:35,523 --> 00:34:38,025
ROSEN:
You look too young
to be a pilot.

717
00:34:38,025 --> 00:34:39,527
I'm a copilot.

718
00:34:39,527 --> 00:34:41,529
Why so nervous?

719
00:34:41,529 --> 00:34:43,030
How would you feel
if you, uh

720
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:46,033
lost your uniform
first week on the job?

721
00:34:46,033 --> 00:34:47,535
Relax.

722
00:34:47,535 --> 00:34:50,037
Pan Am's got
lots of uniforms.

723
00:34:50,037 --> 00:34:52,540
It's gonna be $164.

724
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:54,542
Great. I'll, uh,
I'll write you a check.

725
00:34:54,542 --> 00:34:56,544
Sorry, no checks,
no cash.

726
00:34:56,544 --> 00:34:59,046
You'll have to fill in
your employee I.D. number

727
00:34:59,046 --> 00:35:00,047
and then I'll
bill Pan Am.

728
00:35:00,047 --> 00:35:02,049
They'll take it out
of your next paycheck.

729
00:35:04,051 --> 00:35:06,053
Even better.

730
00:35:08,055 --> 00:35:10,057
FRANK:
Dear Dad:

731
00:35:10,057 --> 00:35:12,560
You always told me that an
honest man has nothing to fear.

732
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,562
So I'm trying my best
not to be afraid.

733
00:35:15,062 --> 00:35:19,567
I'm sorry I ran away,
but you don't have to worry.

734
00:35:19,567 --> 00:35:21,569
I'm gonna get it all back
now, Daddy.

735
00:35:21,569 --> 00:35:24,071
I promise.
I'm going to get it all back.

736
00:35:24,071 --> 00:35:26,073
(approving murmur)

737
00:35:29,577 --> 00:35:31,579
GIRL:
Are you a real live pilot?

738
00:35:31,579 --> 00:35:33,581
I sure am, little lady.
What's your name?

739
00:35:34,081 --> 00:35:34,582
Celine.

740
00:35:35,082 --> 00:35:36,584
Celine, it's a
pleasure to meet you.

741
00:35:36,584 --> 00:35:39,086
It's a pleasure
to meet you, too.

742
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:45,092
That's fifty, seventy

743
00:35:45,092 --> 00:35:49,096
eighty, ninety,
one hundred dollars.

744
00:35:49,096 --> 00:35:51,098
You have yourself a
great time in Paris.

745
00:35:51,098 --> 00:35:52,600
I always do.

746
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,486
Excuse me.

747
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,488
I'm John Modiger.
I manage this branch.

748
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:58,990
I want to thank you
for coming in

749
00:35:58,990 --> 00:35:59,991
and using
our institution.

750
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,993
Well, it's a pleasure
to meet you, John.

751
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:02,994
I'll be back again.

752
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:03,744
Good.

753
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:05,496
Have you stayed with us before?

754
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:09,000
Uh, no, I've been primarily
based on the West Coast.

755
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,503
Is it all right if I write
you a check for the room?

756
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:13,504
No problem, sir.

757
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,506
Great.

758
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:24,015
Uh...

759
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,016
I was also wondering

760
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,018
if I could write you
a personal check?

761
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:30,521
For airline personnel, we cash
personal checks up to $100.

762
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,523
Payroll checks
we cash up to $300.

763
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,527
Did you say $300
for a payroll check?

764
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:39,030
(typewriter keys clacking)

765
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,534
FRANK:
Dear Dad:

766
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:46,537
I've decided to become a pilot
for Pan American Airways...

767
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:49,540
the most trusted name
in the skies.

768
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,543
They've accepted me
into their training program

769
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,545
and told me that if I work hard

770
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:56,047
I should earn my wings
real soon.

771
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,549
Please get in touch with Joanna
Carlton from the tenth grade.

772
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:02,053
Tell her I'm sorry that I could
not take her to the Junior Prom.

773
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,055
Love, your son, Frank.

774
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:16,067
? ?

775
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:29,080
? ?

776
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,591
? ?

777
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,095
Hello, how are you?

778
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,096
Fine, thank you.

779
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:47,098
I have a payroll check here
I'd like to cash.

780
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,100
Certainly.

781
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,101
Thank you.

782
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,104
Uh, excuse me.

783
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,106
I'm sure you hear this
all the time

784
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,108
but you have the most
beautiful eyes I have ever seen.

785
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,611
Yeah, I do get
that all the time.

786
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,613
(nervous laugh)

787
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:04,115
How would you like it?

788
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:16,627
? ?

789
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,131
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

790
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:24,135
We won't have any cash until
the banks open in an hour

791
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,636
but, uh, I'm sure

792
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:28,139
they can cash your
check at the airport.

793
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,640
The airport?

794
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,143
Who cashes checks
at the airport?

795
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:33,144
Well, the airlines, sir.

796
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,646
They've always taken
care of their own.

797
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:38,649
(jet passing overhead)

798
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:41,652
(indistinct flight announcement
over P.A.)

799
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,156
Hello.

800
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,158
Hi. Are you deadheading?

801
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,659
What?

802
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,661
Are you my deadhead to Miami?

803
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:53,164
Mi...?

804
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,665
Yes, yes.

805
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:55,666
(laughs)

806
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:58,169
Yeah, I'm the deadhead.
Here you go.

807
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:01,672
You're a little late,
but the jump seat is open.

808
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:04,175
(chuckling):
You know

809
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,177
it's been awhile
since I've done this.

810
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,678
Which one's the
jump seat again?

811
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:10,181
(both laughing)

812
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,682
Have a nice flight.

813
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:14,185
Are you my deadhead?

814
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,189
STEWARDESS:
Frank, Captain Oliver.

815
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,690
Hello.
John Larkin, the copilot.

816
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,192
Fred Tulley,
flight engineer.

817
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,193
Frank Taylor, Pan Am.

818
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,195
Thanks for giving me
a lift, boys.

819
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,696
Go ahead and take
a seat, Frank.

820
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,198
We're about to push.

821
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,200
What kind of
equipment you on, DC-8?

822
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,202
Uh, 707.

823
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,704
You turning around
on the redeye?

824
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,706
Uh, I'm jumping puddles
for the next few months

825
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:37,708
trying to earn my keep
running leapfrogs

826
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:38,709
for the weak and weary.

827
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:42,213
No shame in that.
We all did it.

828
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:49,720
Have a seat.

829
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,721
Thank you.

830
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,724
Would you like a drink
after takeoff?

831
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,726
M-Milk?

832
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,228
OLIVER:
80 knots.

833
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:58,229
LARKIN:
Check.

834
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,730
V-one. Rotate.

835
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,733
(jet engines roaring)

836
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,735
V-two. Positive rate.

837
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,737
Gear up.

838
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,239
FRANK:
Dear Dad:

839
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,740
Today was graduation.

840
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,742
I am now a copilot

841
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:14,745
earning $1,400 a month
plus benefits

842
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:16,747
and the best part is

843
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:19,250
they tell me
my family can fly for free.

844
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:22,753
So tell Mom to pack her bags
and buy a new swimsuit

845
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:25,756
because I'm taking us all
to Hawaii for Christmas.

846
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:27,258
I love you, Dad.

847
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,260
Aloha, Frank.

848
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,761
Hello, deadhead.

849
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:31,762
Hello.

850
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:33,764
Enjoying your
free ride?

851
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:42,273
Marci...

852
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,275
did you drop this?

853
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,279
Must've slipped
right off your neck.

854
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:49,780
No...

855
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,782
(chuckling)

856
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:53,784
(giggling):
No!

857
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,286
No...

858
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,788
MARCI:
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

859
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:00,791
(Frank moans passionately)

860
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:01,792
Yes!

861
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:03,794
(clanking and clattering)

862
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:04,795
(Marci panting)

863
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:08,799
Why are you stopping?

864
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:12,303
I want to tell you
something, Marci.

865
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:15,806
This is by far...

866
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:20,811
the best date I
have ever been on.

867
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:22,813
(laughing)

868
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:35,826
? ?

869
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,333
WOMAN:
I'd like to open a
Money Market, please.

870
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,335
Okay.

871
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:54,345
Welcome to Miami Mutual Bank.
How may I help you?

872
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:57,848
My name is Frank Taylor.
I'm a copilot for Pan Am.

873
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:00,851
I'd like to cash this check
here, and then

874
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:03,854
I'd like to take you out
for a steak dinner.

875
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,857
(laughing)

876
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:13,864
(teller giggling)

877
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,866
And then we feed the checks
into the MICR machine

878
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:17,368
which uses special ink

879
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:18,369
to encode the
account numbers

880
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,870
on the bottom
of the checks.

881
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:24,375
And where
are these numbers?

882
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,377
They're, um...
right here.

883
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,878
Right there?

884
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:28,879
See?

885
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:31,382
(both giggling)

886
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,384
They're called
routing numbers.

887
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,886
So where do the checks
get routed to?

888
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,889
You know, I don't
exactly know.

889
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:40,391
Nobody ever asked
me that before.

890
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,393
(both laughing)

891
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:43,894
AUCTIONEER:
Our next item up for bid

892
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:46,397
is also from the Jersey
Central Bank foreclosure.

893
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:47,398
This is a MICR encoder

894
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,400
a machine used
to encode bank checks.

895
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,401
Do I have an opening bid?

896
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,403
HANRATTY:
Our unknown subject
is a paperhanger

897
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,405
who started working
on the East Coast.

898
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,407
In the last few weeks,
this unsub has developed

899
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,909
a new form of check fraud
which I'm calling "the float."

900
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:00,411
What he's doing is

901
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,413
he's opening checking accounts
at various banks

902
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:03,914
then changing the MICR ink
routing numbers

903
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:05,416
at the bottom of those checks.

904
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:06,917
Next slide, please.

905
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:07,918
(projector clanks)

906
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,920
Next slide, please.

907
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,422
Uh, the remote
thing is broken.

908
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:12,923
You'll have to
do it by hand.

909
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:13,924
You've gotta...
try the...

910
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:15,426
Agent Mullen,
it should be...

911
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:18,429
it should be the square button
just there by the side.

912
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:19,430
This carousel doesn't work.

913
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:20,931
It's a bad carousel
you got there.

914
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:21,932
Thank you,
Agent Mullen.

915
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:23,434
Got to move
it manually.

916
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:25,936
This is a map of the 12 banks
of the U.S. Federal Reserve.

917
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:27,938
Slide.

918
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:28,939
(clicking)

919
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:30,441
MICR scanners at every bank

920
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:32,943
read these numbers
at the bottom of a check--

921
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:33,944
slide--

922
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:37,448
and then, ship that check off
to its corresponding branch.

923
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,950
Carl, for those of us who are
unfamiliar with bank fraud

924
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,453
you mind telling us
what the hell

925
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:43,954
you're talking about?

926
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:47,958
The East Coast branches are
numbered zero-one to zero-six.

927
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,960
The central branch
is zero-seven, zero-eight

928
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:50,961
so on, so forth.

929
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:52,963
You mean those numbers
on the bottom of a check

930
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:53,964
actually mean something?

931
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:54,965
All of this
was in the report

932
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:56,467
I filed two days ago.

933
00:43:56,467 --> 00:44:00,471
If you change...
a zero-two to a one-two

934
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:03,474
that means that check,
which was cashed in New York

935
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:04,975
does not go to the New York
Federal Branch

936
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:06,477
but it is rerouted

937
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:09,480
all the way to the San Francisco
Federal Branch.

938
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,483
The bank doesn't even know the
check has bounced for two weeks

939
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,485
which means our unsub
can stay in one place

940
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:15,986
paper the same city
over and over again

941
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,738
while his checks
circle the country.

942
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:20,991
You know, you want
to talk to my wife.

943
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:23,994
She's the one balances
the checkbook at our house.

944
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:26,497
(agents laughing)

945
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,834
Next slide.

946
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:36,340
(three-piece combo
plays soft jazz)

947
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,841
Daddy!

948
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:38,842
(chuckling)

949
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:42,846
My son, the birdman.

950
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:43,847
Some uniform, Frank.

951
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:45,849
What do you think?

952
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:47,351
Nice.

953
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:48,852
Sit down.

954
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:50,354
(clears throat)

955
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:54,358
So, Dad... Daddy, have you
gotten the postcards?

956
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:55,359
Of course.

957
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,861
This fork is ice cold.

958
00:44:57,861 --> 00:45:01,365
No, no, Dad, th-that's
a chilled salad fork.

959
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:06,370
(whispering):
It's a fancy restaurant,
you know.

960
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:09,373
(sighing)

961
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:11,875
Well, here...

962
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:13,877
I-I got you something.

963
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:15,713
What's that?

964
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,715
Open it.

965
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,721
You know what
those are, right?

966
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:25,723
Those are the keys

967
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:28,726
to a 1965 Cadillac
DeVille convertible.

968
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,227
Brand-new, Dad.

969
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:33,230
Red with white interior

970
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:37,735
split seats,
air conditioning, the works.

971
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:38,736
Are you giving me
a Cadillac?

972
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:40,738
Yeah. I'm giving you
a Cadillac.

973
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:42,239
Dad, sh-she's parked
downstairs.

974
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:43,741
When we're done
eating lunch

975
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:46,744
why don't you, you know,
drive on over to Mom's house

976
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,746
pick her up,
take a little joyride?

977
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,748
Do you know what
would happen

978
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:52,249
if the IRS found out

979
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:55,753
I was driving around
in a new coupe?

980
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,755
I took the train
here, Frank.

981
00:45:57,755 --> 00:46:00,257
I'm taking the train home.

982
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,761
All right.

983
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:11,769
I have plenty of money.

984
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:14,271
You know, if you
ever, ever need anything...

985
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,773
You worried?

986
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:18,025
About me?

987
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,777
No, I'm not...
I'm not worried.

988
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:22,029
You think I can't
buy my own car?

989
00:46:22,396 --> 00:46:26,784
Two mice fell in a
bucket of cream, Frank.

990
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:28,786
Which one am I?

991
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:31,288
You're that second mouse.

992
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:36,794
I went by the store today.

993
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,796
I had to close the
store for awhile.

994
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:40,297
It's all about
timing, Frank.

995
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:42,299
The goddamn government
knows that.

996
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:43,801
They hit you
when you're down.

997
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:44,802
I wasn't going
to let them

998
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:46,804
take it from me,
so I just...

999
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:49,306
shut the doors myself,
called their bluff.

1000
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:56,313
Sooner or later,
they'll forget about me.

1001
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:58,816
I understand, I...

1002
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:02,319
Have you told Ma?

1003
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:08,325
She's so stubborn, your mother.

1004
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:12,329
Don't worry.

1005
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:14,832
I'm not going to let her go
without a fight.

1006
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:15,833
I been fighting for us...

1007
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:17,334
(gasps quietly)

1008
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:20,337
Dad?

1009
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,342
...since the day we... we met.

1010
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:27,344
Daddy, out of all those men

1011
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:30,347
you were the one that
took her home, remember that.

1012
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:33,851
200 men, sitting in
that tiny social hall

1013
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:35,853
watching her dance.

1014
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:40,858
What was the name of that town?

1015
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:42,359
Montrichard, Dad.

1016
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:43,861
Yeah.

1017
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:46,864
I didn't speak
a word of French

1018
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:50,367
and six weeks later,
she was my wi...

1019
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:53,370
She's your wife.

1020
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:57,374
My son bought me
a Cadillac today.

1021
00:47:57,374 --> 00:48:01,378
I think that calls for a toast.

1022
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:02,880
(soft jazz playing)

1023
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:08,886
(inhaling deeply)

1024
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:12,389
To the best damn pilot
in the sky.

1025
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:13,891
It's not
what you think.

1026
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:16,894
I'm just a copilot.

1027
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:20,397
You see these people
staring at you?

1028
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,402
These are the most
powerful people

1029
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:26,904
in New York City

1030
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:29,406
and they keep peeking
over their shoulders

1031
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,408
wondering where
you're going tonight.

1032
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:32,910
Where you going, Frank?

1033
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:36,413
Dad, nobody's
staring at me.

1034
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:38,415
Some place exotic?

1035
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:43,420
Just tell me where you're going.

1036
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:47,424
Los An... Hollywood.

1037
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:49,927
Hollywood.

1038
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:54,932
(sniffles)

1039
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:56,934
(whispering):
The rest of us...

1040
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:59,937
really are suckers.

1041
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:07,444
So, I got on this red dress
and these high heels, right?

1042
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:08,946
And I got a bra,
like, out here, okay?

1043
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:11,448
And I'm chasing
these two Puerto Rican guys

1044
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:12,449
through the park.

1045
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:14,952
They got a suitcase filled
with bank robbery loot.

1046
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,954
Okay, I'm screaming out,
"FBI, freeze!"

1047
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:19,456
And I'm reaching for my gun,
but I can't find it in the bra.

1048
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:20,457
It's so damn big

1049
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:23,460
I thought I was going
to shoot my tits off.

1050
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,461
(laughing)

1051
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:27,464
You know,
that's a funny story.

1052
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:28,966
People always laugh
at that story.

1053
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:30,968
Let me ask you a
question, Mr. Amdursky.

1054
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,970
If you were having so
much fun undercover

1055
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,972
why did you transfer
to bank fraud?

1056
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:35,973
I didn't transfer.

1057
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:37,474
I was censured
and reassigned.

1058
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:39,977
It's like being punished.
I was punished.

1059
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:41,979
I screwed up
in the field.

1060
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:42,980
What about you,
Mr. Fox?

1061
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,482
Were you... punished for
screwing up in the field?

1062
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:48,485
Oh, no, no, no, I've never
worked in the field before.

1063
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:49,987
I audited
background investigations

1064
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:51,989
of Department of Justice
clerical applicants.

1065
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,490
Well, that's just great.

1066
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:54,992
I ask for a team

1067
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:56,994
and they drag the
bottom of the Pacific.

1068
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:59,496
You mind if I ask you
a question, Agent Hanratty?

1069
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:01,498
How come you're so serious
all the time?

1070
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:04,001
Does it bother you,
Mr. Amdursky?

1071
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:06,503
Yeah. Yeah,
it does bother me.

1072
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:09,006
Does it bother
you, Mr. Fox?

1073
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:10,507
A little, I guess.

1074
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:14,511
Well, would you like to hear me
tell a joke?

1075
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:18,515
Yeah. Yeah, we'd love
to hear a joke from you.

1076
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:21,518
Knock, knock.

1077
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:23,020
Who's there?

1078
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:28,525
Go fuck yourselves.

1079
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:31,028
(swing music playing
on car radio)

1080
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:38,035
? Tall and tan
and young and lovely ?

1081
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:40,037
? The girl from Ipanema... ?

1082
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:41,538
MAN:
He cashed three checks.

1083
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:43,040
They all cleared.

1084
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,792
I was going to deposit
this one today.

1085
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:48,795
I don't want any trouble.

1086
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:51,548
No trouble.

1087
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:52,549
No trouble at all.

1088
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:54,551
We'll just take this check
and be on our way.

1089
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:55,552
Thank you.

1090
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:57,054
Good.

1091
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:59,556
Because I don't want
my customers harassed.

1092
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:01,558
? Each one she passes
goes ahh... ?

1093
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:04,061
What are you saying,
he's still here?

1094
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:07,064
201.

1095
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:09,066
? Oh, but he watches
so sadly... ?

1096
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:10,067
Thank you.

1097
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:11,568
Corner here.

1098
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:13,070
Oh, thanks, son.

1099
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,072
? How can he tell her
he loves her... ?

1100
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:16,073
Some steps.

1101
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:18,075
Steps.

1102
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:22,579
Hey, Mr. Murphy,
how are you?

1103
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:23,580
Is that Frank?

1104
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:24,581
Yeah, it's Frank.

1105
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:26,083
Hey, Frank,
how are you?

1106
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,084
How's the knee?

1107
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:28,585
Come on, I'll
race you right now.

1108
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:30,587
(chuckling):
Take care.

1109
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:32,089
Okay, Frank.

1110
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:33,090
AMDURSKY:
"Eyeball the back"?

1111
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,092
Come on, Carl,
this guy's a pen and ink man.

1112
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:36,093
A goddamn paperhanger.

1113
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:37,094
He doesn't even
carry a gun.

1114
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:38,095
Why can't we go
with you, Carl?

1115
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:40,097
You just keep your
eyes open, do your job

1116
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:42,599
and I'll buy you both
a Good Humor bar.

1117
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:50,107
(grunts)

1118
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:52,109
(gasps)

1119
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:53,110
It's all right, ma'am.
FBI.

1120
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:54,611
(whimpers)

1121
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:59,616
201... 201, 201.

1122
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:01,118
201...

1123
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:02,869
201... 201...

1124
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:06,623
201... 201...

1125
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:08,625
(anxious breathing)

1126
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,627
(music building dramatically)

1127
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:12,129
FBI!

1128
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:19,636
(crunching)

1129
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:21,138
(toilet flushing)

1130
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:22,639
FBI!

1131
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:26,143
Come out of the bathroom!

1132
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:28,145
Step out
of the bathroom!

1133
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:33,150
Hands on your head.

1134
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,651
Oh, that's the new
IBM Selectric.

1135
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:35,652
Put your hands
on your head.

1136
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:38,155
Shut up!
You can change the print
type in five seconds.

1137
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:39,156
Just pop out the ball.

1138
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:41,158
Put your hands on your head!
Put your hands...!

1139
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:42,659
You know, he's got
over 200 checks here

1140
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:44,661
Hands on your head!
a gallon of India ink,
drafting.

1141
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:46,663
Put it down.
Even has little
payroll envelopes...

1142
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:47,664
...addressed to himself
from Pan Am.

1143
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:48,665
Put it down!
Drop it!

1144
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:49,666
Relax.

1145
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:51,168
You're late, all right?

1146
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:52,669
My name's Allen,
Barry Allen

1147
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:54,171
United States Secret Service.

1148
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:56,673
Your boy just tried
to jump out the window.

1149
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:58,175
My partner has him
in custody downstairs.

1150
00:52:58,175 --> 00:52:59,176
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1151
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:02,679
You think the FBI
are the only ones on this guy?

1152
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:03,680
I mean, come on.

1153
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,682
Come on, he's dabbling
in government checks here.

1154
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:07,684
We've been following
a paper trail on this guy

1155
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:09,186
for months now.

1156
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:11,688
Hey, you mind taking that gun
out of my face?

1157
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:12,689
Please. Really.

1158
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,191
I mean, it makes me nervous.

1159
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:16,193
Let me see some
credentials.

1160
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:19,196
Yeah, sure.

1161
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:20,697
Take my whole wallet.

1162
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:22,199
(clears throat)

1163
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:23,700
You want my gun, too?

1164
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,202
Come over here.
Take my gun.

1165
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:27,204
Hey, hey, look,
just do me a favor.

1166
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:29,206
Take a look outside. Look.

1167
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:30,207
Look out the window.

1168
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:31,708
My partner's walking
him to the car

1169
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:32,709
as we speak-- Look.

1170
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:37,214
Old guy almost
pissed in his pants

1171
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:39,216
when I came
through the door.

1172
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:40,717
He jumped right
through the window

1173
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:42,219
onto the hood of my car.

1174
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:44,221
Hey, Murph?

1175
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:46,223
-Yeah?
-Call the LAPD again.

1176
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:48,725
I don't want people walking
through my crime scene.

1177
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:50,727
(raspy cough)

1178
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:53,230
I didn't expect the
Secret Service on this.

1179
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:54,231
Don't worry about it.

1180
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:55,732
(clears throat)

1181
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:56,733
Well, what's your name?

1182
00:53:56,733 --> 00:54:00,237
Hanratty, Carl Hanratty.

1183
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:04,241
(sighs)

1184
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:06,743
Mind if I see
some identification?

1185
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:08,245
Sure.

1186
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:11,748
You never can be
too careful these days.

1187
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:12,749
Well, tough luck, Carl.

1188
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:14,251
Five minutes earlier

1189
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:16,753
you would've landed yourself
a pretty good collar.

1190
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:17,754
It's all right.

1191
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:19,756
Ten seconds later, and
you'd have been shot.

1192
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:22,259
Mind if I come
downstairs with you?

1193
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:24,261
I-I got to take a
look at this guy.

1194
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:25,262
Sure thing.

1195
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:26,263
Just, uh,
do me a favor

1196
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:27,764
and sit tight for a second

1197
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:29,266
while I get
this evidence downstairs.

1198
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:31,268
You know, I don't want
some maid walking through here

1199
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:32,269
and making the bed.

1200
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:33,270
LAPD should be here any sec.

1201
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:34,271
Wait.

1202
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:40,777
Your wallet.

1203
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:42,779
You hang onto it
for a minute.

1204
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:44,781
I trust you.

1205
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:50,287
(sighs)

1206
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:54,291
(exhaling)

1207
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:55,792
(groans)

1208
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:56,793
Oh...

1209
00:54:56,793 --> 00:55:00,797
(chuckling)

1210
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:03,300
Yeah...

1211
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,302
Secret Service.

1212
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:09,806
(ominous music begins)

1213
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:22,319
? ?

1214
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:36,333
? ?

1215
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:43,340
(music building)

1216
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:49,346
Hey!

1217
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:51,348
Oh, goddamn it!

1218
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:53,850
It was stupid.

1219
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:55,352
I made a stupid mistake.

1220
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:57,354
Forget about it.

1221
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:59,856
There are hundreds
of unknown subjects out there.

1222
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:01,358
I-I can get this guy, Sean.

1223
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:03,360
The worst thing
a paperhanger can do

1224
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,861
is show his face.

1225
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:05,862
I read the report.

1226
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:08,365
Six feet tall, brown hair,
27 to 30 years of age

1227
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:09,366
160 pounds.

1228
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:10,867
This could be
almost anybody.

1229
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:12,869
I heard his voice, Sean,
I saw his face.

1230
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:15,872
There's nothing for him
to hide behind anymore.

1231
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:18,375
Just be careful.

1232
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:19,876
You got 12 years in.

1233
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:21,878
Nobody bothers you
down on the first floor.

1234
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:23,880
You practically
wrote the book on bank fraud.

1235
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,382
That's the kind of thing

1236
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:27,384
that can make you
section chief someday.

1237
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:30,887
Just don't put yourself
in this type of position.

1238
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:32,389
What type of position?

1239
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:36,893
Position of being humiliated.

1240
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:47,404
Sean, would you like
to hear me tell a joke?

1241
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:50,407
Yeah, sure.

1242
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:53,410
(pointedly):
Knock, knock!

1243
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:58,915
FRANK:
So, my-my next question is,
when a pilot retires

1244
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:02,419
uh, Pan Am sends them
a check every single month?

1245
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:06,423
Uh, yeah, pension program
sends a check and benefits.

1246
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:07,924
How much
is that check for?

1247
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:09,426
Uh, kid, I'm really
not in the mood

1248
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:10,427
for this right now.

1249
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:11,928
This Skywayman's
driving me crazy.

1250
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:13,430
Who's the Skywayman?

1251
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:15,432
Ah, some nut that's
flying around the country

1252
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:16,933
posing as a Pan Am pilot.

1253
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:20,937
There's a column about
him in the paper today.

1254
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:27,944
I keep telling them
this is not my problem.

1255
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:30,447
This guy
doesn't even fly Pan Am.

1256
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:31,448
Flies everybody else.

1257
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:33,950
Flies United, TWA,
Continental, Eastern...

1258
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:36,453
(whispering):
The Skywayman.

1259
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:38,955
Newspaper loves this clown.

1260
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:42,459
They call him
"the James Bond of the sky."

1261
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:44,961
(chuckles)

1262
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:46,463
Did you say...?

1263
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:47,964
Bond, James Bond.

1264
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:49,966
("007" theme playing)

1265
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:59,976
BOND:
Tell me, Joan,
why does he do it?

1266
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:01,478
WOMAN:
He likes to win.

1267
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:02,479
MAN:
Come on, come on.

1268
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:03,980
We'll be landing
in 20 minutes.

1269
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:06,483
Do you want to play it easy
or the hard way?

1270
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,485
And this isn't a tranquilizer.

1271
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:11,988
Well, Pussy, you do know a lot
more about planes than guns.

1272
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:14,491
(imitating Sean Connery):
Hello, Pussy.

1273
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:17,494
(normal voice):
Now, you're sure
this is the suit, right?

1274
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:18,495
Positive.

1275
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:20,497
It's the exact suit
he wore in the movie.

1276
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:22,499
(Connery voice):
Okay. I'll take three.

1277
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:24,000
Certainly,
Mr. Fleming.

1278
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,503
Now what you need
is one of those

1279
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:29,506
little foreign sports cars
that he drives.

1280
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:32,008
("007" theme playing)

1281
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:35,011
(engine revving)

1282
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:44,521
(final "007" chord strikes)

1283
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:53,530
? The look of love ?

1284
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:56,533
? Is in your eyes... ?

1285
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:57,534
Hello.

1286
00:58:58,034 --> 00:58:59,035
Hi.

1287
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:01,538
? ...The look your heart... ?

1288
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:04,541
Haven't I seen you before?

1289
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:06,543
? ...Can't disguise... ?

1290
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:07,544
Maybe.

1291
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:09,045
A couple years ago

1292
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:11,548
I was on the cover
ofSeventeen.

1293
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:13,049
Yeah.

1294
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:14,551
You're that
model, right?

1295
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:15,552
Cheryl.

1296
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:17,053
Yes.

1297
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:19,055
The guys used to put
your picture

1298
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:20,306
on their lockers.

1299
00:59:20,306 --> 00:59:25,144
Isn't that your silver car
I saw parked out front?

1300
00:59:25,144 --> 00:59:28,064
Yeah. One of them.

1301
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:31,568
? Well, it takes
my breath away... ?

1302
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:34,821
So, think I could get
an autograph?

1303
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:36,573
? ...I can hardly wait
to hold you ?

1304
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:38,074
? Feel my arms around you... ?

1305
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:40,076
Do you have a pen
in your room?

1306
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:42,195
? ...How long I have waited... ?

1307
00:59:42,195 --> 00:59:44,080
(rhythmic mechanical thumping)

1308
00:59:56,593 --> 01:00:01,598
? You've got the look of love ?

1309
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:07,103
? It's on your face ?

1310
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:15,612
? A look that time
can't erase...?

1311
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:17,113
Shh.

1312
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:18,615
? ...Be mine tonight... ?

1313
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:23,620
Man like you can
buy anything he wants.

1314
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:26,623
? ...Let this be
just the start ?

1315
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:33,630
? Of so many nights
like this... ?

1316
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:36,633
He buys a deck of cards
at the hotel gift shop.

1317
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:39,636
? ...And then seal it
with a kiss... ?

1318
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:42,639
Well, you want to
see a card trick?

1319
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:44,140
? ...I can hardly wait
to hold you... ?

1320
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:46,142
How much did these cards cost?

1321
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:48,144
? ...Feel my arms
around you... ?

1322
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:50,146
Oh, 55 cents,
I think.

1323
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:52,649
? ...Waited just
to love you... ?

1324
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:55,151
And if they sold me

1325
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:58,655
downstairs
at the hotel gift shop...

1326
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:01,658
how much would you pay?

1327
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,660
I'm sor...

1328
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:07,664
I'm sorry, how mu... how much
would I pay for what?

1329
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:10,166
(romantic instrumental music
playing)

1330
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:13,670
The entire night.

1331
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:18,174
How much would you pay me
for the entire night?

1332
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:25,181
Cheryl, I...
I really don't know.

1333
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:26,683
? ...I can hardly wait
to hold you... ?

1334
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:29,686
Don't be scared.

1335
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:32,689
? ...How long I have waited... ?

1336
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:35,692
Make me an offer.

1337
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:39,195
? ...Now that I have found you ?

1338
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:42,699
? Don't ever go... ?

1339
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:44,701
$300?

1340
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:46,703
Go fish.

1341
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:49,205
(sheepish chuckle)

1342
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:52,709
Uh, $500?

1343
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:54,711
Go fish.

1344
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:55,712
(chuckles)

1345
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:57,213
$600.

1346
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:58,715
(both chuckling)

1347
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:00,717
Go fish.

1348
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:02,719
(saxophone playing sexy riff)

1349
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:05,221
$1,000.

1350
01:02:07,223 --> 01:02:08,725
Okay.

1351
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:12,729
$1,000.

1352
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:15,732
Okay.

1353
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:18,234
I'll be right back.

1354
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:19,736
Wait a second.
Where are you going?

1355
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:21,237
I'm going downstairs

1356
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:22,238
to cash a check.

1357
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:25,241
You think this hotel is going
to cash a $1,000 check

1358
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:27,243
at 3:00am?

1359
01:02:30,246 --> 01:02:32,248
It's a New York
Savings and Loan check.

1360
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:33,249
It's like gold.

1361
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:34,751
They'll cash it.

1362
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,252
Don't you think
they might get

1363
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:37,754
a little suspicious?

1364
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:38,755
Let me see that.

1365
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:40,757
It's a cashier's check.

1366
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:42,759
Endorse it over to me.

1367
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:44,761
No. I couldn't do that.

1368
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:47,263
See, this check
is for $1,400.

1369
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:49,766
We agreed upon $1,000.

1370
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:53,269
Why don't I give
you back $400

1371
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:56,272
and you give me
that check?

1372
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:59,275
Even better.

1373
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:06,783
? The look of love ?

1374
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:12,789
? Is in your eyes... ?

1375
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:15,291
(saxophone continues melody)

1376
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:33,309
Does this belong
to anybody?

1377
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:43,820
(over radio):
? Mele Kalikimaka
is the thing to say... ?

1378
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:46,322
(phone ringing)

1379
01:03:46,322 --> 01:03:49,325
? On a bright
Hawaiian Christmas Day... ?

1380
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:51,327
This is Hanratty.
Merry Christmas.

1381
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:52,829
FRANK:
Hello, Carl.

1382
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:54,330
Hello.

1383
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:56,833
? ...That we send to you,
from the land... ?

1384
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:58,835
Barry Allen, Secret Service.

1385
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:01,838
I've been trying
to track you down now

1386
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:03,840
for the last couple of hours.

1387
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,341
What do you want?

1388
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:07,844
I wanted to apologize
for what happened

1389
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:09,846
out in Los Angeles.

1390
01:04:10,346 --> 01:04:11,347
Uh-uh, uh-uh.

1391
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:13,349
No, no,
you don't apologize to me.

1392
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:15,852
Do you always work
on Christmas Eve, Carl?

1393
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:17,353
I volunteered

1394
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:20,356
so men with families
could go home early.

1395
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:22,859
Looked like you were wearing
a wedding ring

1396
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:23,860
out in Los Angeles.

1397
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:25,361
I thought maybe
you had a family.

1398
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:28,865
No. No family.

1399
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:30,867
You want to talk to me...

1400
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:32,869
let's talk face-to-face.

1401
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:34,370
All right.

1402
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:38,374
I'm at my suite at the
Stuyvesant Arms, room 3113.

1403
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:42,378
In the morning, I leave
for Las Vegas for the weekend.

1404
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:46,382
You think you're going
to get me again?

1405
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:48,384
You're not going to Vegas.

1406
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:50,386
You're not
in the Stuyvesant Arms.

1407
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:51,888
You'd love for me

1408
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:54,390
to send out 20 agents
Christmas Eve

1409
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:57,393
we barge into your hotel,
knock down the door

1410
01:04:57,393 --> 01:04:59,395
so you can make fools
out of us all.

1411
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:01,898
I'm really sorry
if I made a fool out of you.

1412
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:02,899
I really am.

1413
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:03,900
Uh-uh, no.

1414
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,401
No, listen, I really am.

1415
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:07,904
No, no, you-you do not
feel sorry for me.

1416
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:09,906
The truth is,
I knew it was you.

1417
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:13,025
Now maybe I didn't get the cuffs
on you, but I knew.

1418
01:05:13,025 --> 01:05:16,913
Ah, people only know
what you tell them, Carl.

1419
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:20,416
Well, then tell me this,
Barry Allen, Secret Service.

1420
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:23,920
How did you know
I wouldn't look in your wallet?

1421
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,422
The same reason
the Yankees always win.

1422
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:29,926
Nobody can keep their eyes
off the pinstripes.

1423
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:32,929
The Yankees win
because they have Mickey Mantle.

1424
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:35,431
No one ever bets
on the uniform.

1425
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:36,432
(Frank chuckles)

1426
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:38,434
You sure about that, Carl?

1427
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:40,436
I'll tell you what Iamsure of.

1428
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:42,438
You're going to get caught.

1429
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:45,942
One way or another,
it's a mathematical fact.

1430
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:47,443
It's-It's like Vegas.

1431
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:49,979
The House always wins.

1432
01:05:53,983 --> 01:05:57,987
Well, Carl, I'm sorry,
but I have to go.

1433
01:05:57,987 --> 01:06:00,990
Ah. You didn't call
just to apologize, did you?

1434
01:06:00,990 --> 01:06:01,991
(laughing)

1435
01:06:01,991 --> 01:06:04,493
What do you mean?

1436
01:06:04,493 --> 01:06:07,496
You... you...
you have no one else to call.

1437
01:06:07,496 --> 01:06:09,498
(laughing)

1438
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,501
Oh, ho, ho.

1439
01:06:12,501 --> 01:06:15,004
(phone bell dings)

1440
01:06:15,004 --> 01:06:16,505
(guffaws)

1441
01:06:16,505 --> 01:06:19,008
(humming)

1442
01:06:19,008 --> 01:06:21,010
? ...Morn and night... ?

1443
01:06:23,012 --> 01:06:27,016
(melancholy melody playing)

1444
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:33,022
(melody fades)

1445
01:06:33,022 --> 01:06:34,523
You got that burger up?

1446
01:06:35,024 --> 01:06:36,025
Yep.

1447
01:06:36,025 --> 01:06:38,527
("He's So Fine"
playing on radio)

1448
01:06:39,028 --> 01:06:39,528
Hi.

1449
01:06:40,029 --> 01:06:40,529
Hi!

1450
01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:42,031
How are you?

1451
01:06:42,031 --> 01:06:44,033
? ...Doo-lang, doo-lang,
doo-lang... ?

1452
01:06:44,033 --> 01:06:45,534
? The one
with the wavy hair... ?

1453
01:06:45,534 --> 01:06:47,036
More coffee, sir?

1454
01:06:53,542 --> 01:06:55,044
Are you a collector?

1455
01:06:55,044 --> 01:06:56,545
Of what?

1456
01:06:56,545 --> 01:06:58,547
"Captives of the Cosmic
Ray," "The Big Freeze"

1457
01:06:58,547 --> 01:07:00,049
"Land of the
Golden Giants."

1458
01:07:00,049 --> 01:07:01,050
I've got them all.

1459
01:07:01,050 --> 01:07:03,552
What are you talking about?

1460
01:07:03,552 --> 01:07:05,554
Barry Allen.

1461
01:07:07,556 --> 01:07:09,058
The Flash.

1462
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:12,561
Wait, kid, kid, kid.

1463
01:07:15,064 --> 01:07:16,565
You mean like
the comic book?

1464
01:07:16,565 --> 01:07:17,566
Yeah, the
comic book.

1465
01:07:17,566 --> 01:07:18,567
When he's not
The Flash.

1466
01:07:18,567 --> 01:07:20,069
That's his name,
Barry Allen.

1467
01:07:20,069 --> 01:07:23,072
Thank you.

1468
01:07:27,076 --> 01:07:29,578
Now get this:
He reads comic books.

1469
01:07:29,578 --> 01:07:31,080
Comic books!
Barry Allen is The Flash!

1470
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:32,581
FOX:
Carl, slow down. Slow down.

1471
01:07:32,581 --> 01:07:34,583
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

1472
01:07:34,583 --> 01:07:37,086
He's a kid.
Our unsub is a kid.

1473
01:07:37,086 --> 01:07:39,088
That's why we couldn't match
his prints.

1474
01:07:39,088 --> 01:07:40,589
That's why he doesn't have
a record.

1475
01:07:40,589 --> 01:07:42,091
Now, I want you to contact NYPD

1476
01:07:42,091 --> 01:07:44,593
for every all-points juvenile
runaways in New York City.

1477
01:07:44,593 --> 01:07:46,095
And don't forget the airports.

1478
01:07:46,095 --> 01:07:48,097
He's been kiting checks
all over the country.

1479
01:07:48,597 --> 01:07:49,598
But why New York?

1480
01:07:49,598 --> 01:07:50,599
The Yankees!

1481
01:07:50,599 --> 01:07:53,602
He said something
about the Yankees!

1482
01:07:53,602 --> 01:07:56,105
HANRATTY:
So where are we
on the list?

1483
01:07:56,105 --> 01:07:57,606
(rings doorbell)

1484
01:07:57,606 --> 01:08:00,609
FOX:
Number 53,
"Abagnahlee."

1485
01:08:03,112 --> 01:08:04,113
HANRATTY:
Good morning, ma'am.

1486
01:08:04,113 --> 01:08:05,614
We're the FBI agents
who called.

1487
01:08:05,614 --> 01:08:07,116
Yes, I've been waiting.

1488
01:08:07,116 --> 01:08:09,118
I hope you're all hungry.

1489
01:08:09,118 --> 01:08:10,619
I put out the Sara Lee.

1490
01:08:13,622 --> 01:08:15,624
My husband Jack
is a lawyer.

1491
01:08:15,624 --> 01:08:18,627
What about your first husband,
Mrs. "Abagnahlee"?

1492
01:08:19,128 --> 01:08:20,629
Abagnale

1493
01:08:20,629 --> 01:08:22,631
but I prefer
to be called Barnes.

1494
01:08:24,133 --> 01:08:26,135
"Frank William Abagnale."

1495
01:08:26,135 --> 01:08:27,636
It says here
he was in the service.

1496
01:08:27,636 --> 01:08:29,638
Did... Did you two meet
during the war?

1497
01:08:29,638 --> 01:08:32,641
Yeah, I lived
in a very small village

1498
01:08:32,641 --> 01:08:35,644
in France-- Montrichard--
the kind of place

1499
01:08:35,644 --> 01:08:38,647
where they never heard
of Sara Lee.

1500
01:08:38,647 --> 01:08:40,149
Help yourselves.

1501
01:08:40,149 --> 01:08:42,151
"Nobody doesn't
like Sara Lee."

1502
01:08:42,151 --> 01:08:44,653
You filled out
a missing person's report

1503
01:08:44,653 --> 01:08:47,656
for a runaway juvenile by
the name of Frank Abagnale Jr.

1504
01:08:47,656 --> 01:08:49,158
Is Frankie okay?

1505
01:08:49,158 --> 01:08:51,660
You're aware of the fact
that he wrote some checks

1506
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:53,662
on a closed account
at Chase Manhattan Bank?

1507
01:08:53,662 --> 01:08:55,164
Oh, yes.

1508
01:08:55,164 --> 01:08:57,666
The police think
he's some type of criminal.

1509
01:08:57,666 --> 01:09:00,169
What he did was a felony,
Mrs. Barnes.

1510
01:09:00,169 --> 01:09:02,171
It was $1,000.

1511
01:09:02,171 --> 01:09:05,174
Half the kids his age
are on dope

1512
01:09:05,174 --> 01:09:08,177
throwing rocks at police

1513
01:09:08,177 --> 01:09:09,678
and they scared me
to death

1514
01:09:09,678 --> 01:09:11,680
because my son made
a little mistake.

1515
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:13,682
Huh. A 17-year-...

1516
01:09:13,682 --> 01:09:18,187
old boy has to eat,
has to have a place to sleep.

1517
01:09:18,187 --> 01:09:20,689
We understand, ma'am.

1518
01:09:20,689 --> 01:09:22,191
Would you happen to have
a picture of your son?

1519
01:09:22,191 --> 01:09:24,193
Oh, yes.
I have his old yearbook.

1520
01:09:33,202 --> 01:09:35,204
Okay.

1521
01:09:35,204 --> 01:09:37,206
Okay, okay, we, uh...

1522
01:09:37,206 --> 01:09:40,209
we need to send out
an all-office teletype.

1523
01:09:40,209 --> 01:09:43,712
Our unsub's name is
Frank Abagnale Jr., age 17.

1524
01:09:43,712 --> 01:09:46,215
Is Frankie okay?
Is he in trouble?

1525
01:09:46,215 --> 01:09:47,716
Ma'am, I'm sorry
to have to tell you:

1526
01:09:47,716 --> 01:09:48,717
Your son
is forging checks.

1527
01:09:48,717 --> 01:09:50,719
Forging checks? Wait!

1528
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:52,221
I'm sure we can
take care of that.

1529
01:09:52,221 --> 01:09:53,722
I am working part-time
at the church now.

1530
01:09:54,223 --> 01:09:56,225
Just tell me how much he owes
and I'll pay you back.

1531
01:09:56,725 --> 01:09:59,228
So far, it's about
$1.3 million.

1532
01:10:04,733 --> 01:10:06,235
(timer dings)

1533
01:10:06,235 --> 01:10:08,237
? Girl, you really
got me goin' ?

1534
01:10:08,237 --> 01:10:11,240
? You got me so
I don't know what I'm doin' ?

1535
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:12,741
(screaming and laughing)

1536
01:10:12,741 --> 01:10:14,243
? Yeah, you really
got me goin' ?

1537
01:10:14,243 --> 01:10:16,245
? You got me
so I can't sleep at night... ?

1538
01:10:16,245 --> 01:10:18,247
Hi, Melanie, how are you?

1539
01:10:18,247 --> 01:10:19,248
When you're in the house

1540
01:10:19,248 --> 01:10:20,249
please, just use an ashtray.

1541
01:10:20,249 --> 01:10:22,251
Frank, this fondue
is so good!

1542
01:10:22,251 --> 01:10:24,253
Great. Here,
take this for me.

1543
01:10:24,253 --> 01:10:25,754
Ooh, good!
I love Moet!

1544
01:10:25,754 --> 01:10:26,755
? Oh, yeah... ?

1545
01:10:26,755 --> 01:10:28,757
Hey. How are you?

1546
01:10:28,757 --> 01:10:30,259
? You really got me goin' ?

1547
01:10:30,259 --> 01:10:32,261
? You got me goin',
got me goin' and goin'... ?

1548
01:10:32,261 --> 01:10:34,263
(music slows and distorts)

1549
01:10:34,263 --> 01:10:36,265
James, James, please!

1550
01:10:36,265 --> 01:10:38,267
Just stay away from the
hi-fi system, all right?

1551
01:10:38,267 --> 01:10:39,268
It's reel-to-reel.

1552
01:10:39,268 --> 01:10:40,769
You can't wind it
like that.

1553
01:10:40,769 --> 01:10:42,771
? Don't ever set me free... ?

1554
01:10:42,771 --> 01:10:43,772
(drink sloshes)

1555
01:10:43,772 --> 01:10:46,275
Christ! Terry!

1556
01:10:46,275 --> 01:10:47,276
This is Italian knit!

1557
01:10:47,276 --> 01:10:48,277
Watch where you're going!

1558
01:10:48,277 --> 01:10:49,778
It's just a shirt, man!

1559
01:10:49,778 --> 01:10:52,281
Frank! Come quick!

1560
01:10:52,781 --> 01:10:55,784
Lance just fell
into the conversation pit!

1561
01:11:00,789 --> 01:11:03,792
Excuse me, you know
where Lance Applebaum is?

1562
01:11:03,792 --> 01:11:05,794
Thank you.

1563
01:11:05,794 --> 01:11:08,297
DOCTOR:
These bottles need to be
labeled when you pick them up.

1564
01:11:08,297 --> 01:11:09,798
Do you understand
how dangerous this is?

1565
01:11:09,798 --> 01:11:11,800
Do you?

1566
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:13,802
Don't stand there crying,
just nod your head

1567
01:11:13,802 --> 01:11:14,803
and tell me you
won't do it again.

1568
01:11:15,304 --> 01:11:16,805
Now dry up and
get back to work.

1569
01:11:16,805 --> 01:11:20,809
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Dr. Blair, Dr. Blair,
Dr. Sherwood Blair.

1570
01:11:20,809 --> 01:11:22,311
(gently):
Hey, hey...

1571
01:11:22,811 --> 01:11:24,313
you okay?

1572
01:11:24,813 --> 01:11:27,316
(sniffling):
He told me to pick up
the blood, so I did

1573
01:11:27,316 --> 01:11:29,818
but he never told me
to label it.

1574
01:11:29,818 --> 01:11:31,820
Hey, it's okay.

1575
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:33,822
Stop crying.

1576
01:11:33,822 --> 01:11:35,824
What's your name?

1577
01:11:35,824 --> 01:11:37,326
Brenda.

1578
01:11:37,326 --> 01:11:38,827
Brenda.

1579
01:11:38,827 --> 01:11:40,829
Brenda, I wouldn't worry
about it.

1580
01:11:40,829 --> 01:11:42,331
You know, these doctors

1581
01:11:42,331 --> 01:11:44,833
you know,
they don't know everything.

1582
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:46,335
It's my first week

1583
01:11:46,335 --> 01:11:49,338
and I think they're
going to fire me.

1584
01:11:49,338 --> 01:11:52,841
No, no, nobody's
going to fire you, Brenda.

1585
01:11:52,841 --> 01:11:54,843
I bet you're good
at your job.

1586
01:11:54,843 --> 01:11:56,845
No, I'm not.

1587
01:11:57,346 --> 01:11:58,847
Yeah, I bet

1588
01:11:58,847 --> 01:12:00,849
if I asked you
to check on the status

1589
01:12:00,849 --> 01:12:02,851
of my friend
Lance Applebaum

1590
01:12:02,851 --> 01:12:05,354
that you could do that for me
in a second.

1591
01:12:05,354 --> 01:12:08,357
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Nurse Fitzsimmons
to Recovery.

1592
01:12:08,357 --> 01:12:09,858
Nurse Fitzsimmons to Recovery.

1593
01:12:10,359 --> 01:12:13,362
Um...

1594
01:12:13,362 --> 01:12:16,365
Mr. Applebaum
fractured his ankle.

1595
01:12:16,365 --> 01:12:19,868
Dr. Ashland is treating him
in exam room seven.

1596
01:12:19,868 --> 01:12:23,372
You see that? No problem.

1597
01:12:24,873 --> 01:12:27,376
This is the emergency chart.

1598
01:12:27,876 --> 01:12:29,378
See that blue star there?

1599
01:12:29,378 --> 01:12:31,880
That means that the patient
has been diagnosed.

1600
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:33,882
And then,
after he's been treated

1601
01:12:33,882 --> 01:12:37,386
we put a red circle
here, see?

1602
01:12:37,386 --> 01:12:38,887
How do you like
those braces?

1603
01:12:40,889 --> 01:12:43,392
I guess they're all right.

1604
01:12:43,392 --> 01:12:46,395
I got mine off last year.

1605
01:12:46,395 --> 01:12:48,397
Boy, I hated them.
They were bottoms.

1606
01:12:48,397 --> 01:12:50,399
You know, I still got to wear

1607
01:12:50,399 --> 01:12:52,401
my mouth guard.

1608
01:12:52,401 --> 01:12:54,903
You have
really nice teeth.

1609
01:12:55,904 --> 01:12:57,906
Well, thank you.

1610
01:12:57,906 --> 01:13:01,410
And you have
a pretty smile.

1611
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:02,911
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Custodial to cafeteria.

1612
01:13:03,412 --> 01:13:04,413
(giggles)

1613
01:13:04,413 --> 01:13:05,414
No, I mean it.

1614
01:13:05,414 --> 01:13:07,416
I really think those
braces look good on you.

1615
01:13:07,916 --> 01:13:09,418
Thank you.

1616
01:13:09,918 --> 01:13:11,920
You're welcome.

1617
01:13:14,423 --> 01:13:15,924
Brenda.

1618
01:13:15,924 --> 01:13:17,426
Yeah.

1619
01:13:17,426 --> 01:13:20,429
Do you know if they're
hiring here at the hospital?

1620
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:23,432
I'm not sure.

1621
01:13:23,432 --> 01:13:24,933
What do you want to do?

1622
01:13:24,933 --> 01:13:28,937
I'm a doctor.

1623
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:33,242
FRANK:
Dear Dad:

1624
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:35,744
I've decided to get
off the road for awhile.

1625
01:13:35,744 --> 01:13:37,746
I've taken a night job
at a hospital

1626
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:39,748
and met
some really nice people.

1627
01:13:39,748 --> 01:13:41,750
Feels good to have my feet
on the ground

1628
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:45,754
to wake up in the same bed
every night.

1629
01:13:45,754 --> 01:13:49,758
Who knows, maybe I'll even find
someone to settle down with.

1630
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:54,263
Harvard Medical School...

1631
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:56,765
top of your class.

1632
01:13:56,765 --> 01:13:59,768
Southern California
Children's Hospital.

1633
01:13:59,768 --> 01:14:03,272
Well, that's a pretty impressive
resume, Dr. Conners

1634
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:06,775
but unfortunately, uh...
the only thing I need

1635
01:14:06,775 --> 01:14:10,279
is a... an emergency room
supervisor

1636
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:13,282
for my midnight
to 8:00am shift

1637
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:17,786
someone to baby-sit
six interns and 20 nurses

1638
01:14:17,786 --> 01:14:20,289
but, uh...

1639
01:14:20,789 --> 01:14:24,793
Hell, I doubt that, uh,
you would be interested in that.

1640
01:14:24,793 --> 01:14:26,295
Well, in the past

1641
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:31,300
they've always let me
choose my own nurses.

1642
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:33,802
Dr. Connelly?

1643
01:14:33,802 --> 01:14:35,304
Dr. Harris?

1644
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:36,305
Present.

1645
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:38,307
Dr. Ashland?

1646
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:39,808
Dr. Conners...

1647
01:14:39,808 --> 01:14:42,311
You gonna take roll every night?

1648
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:43,812
Uh, yes, I will,
Dr. Ashland

1649
01:14:43,812 --> 01:14:46,315
and if you're
going to be late

1650
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:47,816
I suggest
you bring a note.

1651
01:14:47,816 --> 01:14:51,320
(snickering)

1652
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:53,322
Miss Basmann.

1653
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:55,324
Miss Mace.

1654
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:56,825
Miss Strong.

1655
01:14:56,825 --> 01:14:58,327
Here.

1656
01:14:58,327 --> 01:15:00,329
Nurse Brown.

1657
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:02,331
Nurse Sanford?
Here.

1658
01:15:02,831 --> 01:15:04,833
SURGEON (on TV):
30 milligrams of codeine
every four hours.

1659
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:06,335
Run the plasma
at 60 drops a minute

1660
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:08,837
until we calculate
the fluid requirements.

1661
01:15:08,837 --> 01:15:11,340
What do you estimate
the degree and extent

1662
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:12,341
of the burns, Kildare?

1663
01:15:12,341 --> 01:15:13,842
DR. KILDARE:
Second and third-degree burns

1664
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:15,844
over about 20 percent
of the body surface.

1665
01:15:15,844 --> 01:15:16,845
Do you concur?

1666
01:15:16,845 --> 01:15:17,846
I concur.

1667
01:15:17,846 --> 01:15:19,848
Let's get him up to Pediatrics.

1668
01:15:19,848 --> 01:15:23,352
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Nurse Hopp to the Nurses'
Station South.

1669
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:26,355
Nurse Hopp to
the Nurses' Station South.

1670
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:27,856
Hello, Brenda.

1671
01:15:27,856 --> 01:15:28,857
Hi, Dr. Conners.

1672
01:15:28,857 --> 01:15:30,859
You need to sign these.

1673
01:15:30,859 --> 01:15:32,861
Thank you.

1674
01:15:38,867 --> 01:15:40,869
Do you notice anything
different about me, Doctor?

1675
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:42,871
You got your
braces off!
Yeah!

1676
01:15:42,871 --> 01:15:43,872
Come here.
Let me see.

1677
01:15:43,872 --> 01:15:45,874
I've been trying
to show you all night!

1678
01:15:45,874 --> 01:15:47,376
(thunder rumbling)

1679
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:49,378
Wow. Good job.

1680
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:50,879
Yeah?

1681
01:15:50,879 --> 01:15:52,381
So, did it hurt when
they took them off?

1682
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:53,882
Mine felt so weird after.

1683
01:15:53,882 --> 01:15:55,884
Mm, I keep rubbing
my tongue over them.

1684
01:15:55,884 --> 01:15:57,886
I can't stop.
They're so slippery.

1685
01:15:57,886 --> 01:15:59,388
It feels good, though,
doesn't it?

1686
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:01,390
Yeah, it feels incredible.

1687
01:16:02,891 --> 01:16:05,394
(thunder rumbles)

1688
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:12,401
Oh, my.

1689
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:14,903
I'm... I'm sorry.

1690
01:16:14,903 --> 01:16:16,905
(thunder crashes)

1691
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:18,907
(passionate moaning)

1692
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:28,417
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Dr. Conners to the ER.

1693
01:16:28,917 --> 01:16:30,419
Dr. Conners to the ER.

1694
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:31,420
Shouldn't you go?

1695
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:33,422
No. No, no.

1696
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:35,424
They have a staff doctor
in the emergency ward.

1697
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:37,426
We'll be fine.

1698
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:44,933
(panting):
What if he's in surgery?

1699
01:16:44,933 --> 01:16:48,437
Do you really think
I have to go?

1700
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:50,939
Oh. In here,
Dr. Conners.

1701
01:16:50,939 --> 01:16:52,941
(child sobbing)

1702
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:04,953
(sobbing)

1703
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:11,460
Gentlemen, what, uh...
what seems to be the problem?

1704
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:12,461
Bicycle accident.

1705
01:17:12,961 --> 01:17:16,965
Fractured tibia about
five inches below the patella.

1706
01:17:16,965 --> 01:17:18,967
Hmm.

1707
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:23,472
Dr. Harris. Yes?

1708
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:24,473
Do you concur?

1709
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:27,976
C... Concur
with what, sir?

1710
01:17:27,976 --> 01:17:29,978
With what Dr. Ashland
just said.

1711
01:17:29,978 --> 01:17:32,481
Do you... Do you concur?

1712
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:34,983
Uh... well, it was
a bicycle accident.

1713
01:17:34,983 --> 01:17:36,985
Um, the boy told us.

1714
01:17:36,985 --> 01:17:38,487
So you concur?

1715
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:39,988
Concur? Uh...

1716
01:17:39,988 --> 01:17:41,990
I think we should
take an X ray

1717
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:44,493
then stitch him up and put him
in a walking cast.

1718
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:45,994
(moans)

1719
01:17:47,996 --> 01:17:49,998
That's very good, Dr. Ashland.
Very good.

1720
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:53,001
Well, you don't seem
to have much need for me.

1721
01:17:53,001 --> 01:17:54,503
Carry on.

1722
01:17:56,505 --> 01:17:59,508
I blew it, didn't I?

1723
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:01,510
Why didn't I concur?

1724
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:04,513
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Dr. Henning, call extension 219.

1725
01:18:04,513 --> 01:18:06,014
Dr. Henning, extension 219.

1726
01:18:06,014 --> 01:18:08,016
(vomiting)

1727
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:20,028
(distant jackhammer drilling)

1728
01:18:23,532 --> 01:18:24,533
FRANK SR.:
Make yourself at home!

1729
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:27,536
Frank Abagnale Sr.

1730
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:30,038
You're not a cop.

1731
01:18:30,038 --> 01:18:34,042
Special Agent Hanratty, FBI.

1732
01:18:34,042 --> 01:18:35,043
You're not a cop.

1733
01:18:35,043 --> 01:18:37,546
My landlord said
you were not a cop.

1734
01:18:37,546 --> 01:18:39,047
Well, if you're
going to arrest me

1735
01:18:39,047 --> 01:18:40,549
I'd like to put on
a different suit

1736
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:42,050
if that's okay with you.

1737
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:43,552
No, no, I'm not here
to arrest you.

1738
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:45,554
I'm looking for your son.
He's in trouble.

1739
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:47,055
Do you know where he is?

1740
01:18:50,058 --> 01:18:51,059
If I tell you where he is

1741
01:18:51,059 --> 01:18:53,061
will you promise
not to tell his mother?

1742
01:18:53,061 --> 01:18:55,063
Sure.

1743
01:18:55,063 --> 01:18:58,567
Frank made up a fake I.D.

1744
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:00,068
and enlisted
in the Marine Corps.

1745
01:19:00,068 --> 01:19:01,570
He's over in Vietnam right now.

1746
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:03,071
That kid is halfway
around the world

1747
01:19:03,071 --> 01:19:05,574
crawling through
the damn jungle

1748
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:08,076
fighting
the Communists, so...

1749
01:19:08,076 --> 01:19:10,579
(shuts refrigerator door)

1750
01:19:10,579 --> 01:19:14,082
please, don't come to my home
and call my boy a criminal

1751
01:19:14,082 --> 01:19:15,584
because that kid
has more guts...

1752
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:17,586
I never said he was a criminal,
Mr. Abagnale.

1753
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:19,087
I said he was in trouble.

1754
01:19:19,087 --> 01:19:22,591
If you'd like to give me a call
and talk, here's my number.

1755
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:35,103
(pen scribbling)

1756
01:19:35,103 --> 01:19:36,605
You're not a father,
are you?

1757
01:19:39,107 --> 01:19:41,109
Pardon me?

1758
01:19:41,109 --> 01:19:42,611
If you were a father,
you'd know.

1759
01:19:42,611 --> 01:19:46,114
I would never
give up my son.

1760
01:19:46,114 --> 01:19:50,118
I would never give up my son.

1761
01:19:50,118 --> 01:19:53,622
Yes, sir.
I understand.

1762
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:55,624
Sean, Sean, now get this:

1765
01:19:58,627 --> 01:20:00,629
Atlanta, Georgia."

1766
01:20:00,629 --> 01:20:02,130
Atlanta, Georgia.

1767
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:03,632
Yeah, I'm on my way
to the airport.

1768
01:20:03,632 --> 01:20:05,634
I'll meet the team in, uh,
in four hours.

1769
01:20:05,634 --> 01:20:07,135
Bye-bye.

1770
01:20:09,638 --> 01:20:11,139
Come on, it's okay.

1771
01:20:11,139 --> 01:20:12,641
(Brenda sobs)

1772
01:20:12,641 --> 01:20:14,643
You don't have to cry.

1773
01:20:14,643 --> 01:20:15,644
I'm sorry.

1774
01:20:16,144 --> 01:20:17,646
I'm so sorry, Frank.

1775
01:20:17,646 --> 01:20:19,147
I can't do this.

1776
01:20:19,147 --> 01:20:21,650
Brenda, listen to me.

1777
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:24,152
I don't care if you're
a virgin, all right?

1778
01:20:24,152 --> 01:20:25,153
Really, I can wait.

1779
01:20:25,153 --> 01:20:28,657
I'm not a virgin.

1780
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:35,163
I had an abortion
two years ago.

1781
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:41,670
My parents had a friend do it

1782
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:46,174
a man that my father
plays golf with.

1783
01:20:46,174 --> 01:20:48,176
And then,
when I got better

1784
01:20:48,176 --> 01:20:50,679
they kicked me
out of the house.

1785
01:20:50,679 --> 01:20:53,181
I had an abortion and I wasn't
their daughter anymore.

1786
01:20:53,181 --> 01:20:54,683
(gently):
Hey...

1787
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:55,684
I'm so sorry.

1788
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:57,686
Please don't be mad at me.

1789
01:20:57,686 --> 01:20:59,688
Please, please
don't be mad at me.

1790
01:20:59,688 --> 01:21:00,689
No, no.

1791
01:21:00,689 --> 01:21:02,691
Please don't be mad at me.

1792
01:21:02,691 --> 01:21:04,693
Shh. Now... what if...

1793
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:07,696
what if I spoke
to your parents, right?

1794
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:09,698
May-Maybe I can
straighten things out, huh?

1795
01:21:09,698 --> 01:21:11,700
Well, I ask them
all the time

1796
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:14,703
but they said I still
can't come home.

1797
01:21:14,703 --> 01:21:18,707
And my daddy's...
a lawyer.

1798
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:20,542
Aw...

1799
01:21:26,047 --> 01:21:29,551
Brenda...

1800
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:33,054
what if you were engaged
to a doctor?

1801
01:21:33,054 --> 01:21:35,056
Will that change anything?

1802
01:21:35,056 --> 01:21:36,558
What?

1803
01:21:40,061 --> 01:21:44,065
What if I went
to your parents...

1804
01:21:44,065 --> 01:21:46,067
and I spoke
to your father...

1805
01:21:49,571 --> 01:21:52,574
and I asked permission
to marry you?

1806
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:06,087
? ?

1807
01:22:06,087 --> 01:22:07,088
It's empty.

1808
01:22:07,088 --> 01:22:08,590
Nobody here.

1809
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:21,603
? ?

1810
01:22:25,607 --> 01:22:28,610
(classical music playing)

1811
01:22:31,613 --> 01:22:33,615
(woman laughs)

1812
01:22:33,615 --> 01:22:36,117
Dr. Conners, are you Lutheran?

1813
01:22:36,117 --> 01:22:38,119
Yes, I-I am a Lutheran

1814
01:22:38,119 --> 01:22:41,623
but, please,
call me Frank.

1815
01:22:41,623 --> 01:22:44,125
Frank, would you like
to say grace?

1816
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:52,634
Unless you're not comfortable.

1817
01:22:52,634 --> 01:22:54,636
Absolutely.

1818
01:22:56,638 --> 01:22:58,640
(clears throat)

1819
01:23:04,145 --> 01:23:07,649
Two little mice fell
into a bucket of cream.

1820
01:23:09,401 --> 01:23:11,653
The first mouse quickly
gave up and drowned

1821
01:23:11,653 --> 01:23:14,155
but the second mouse,
he struggled so hard

1822
01:23:14,155 --> 01:23:16,658
that he eventually churned
that cream into butter

1823
01:23:16,658 --> 01:23:18,660
and he walked out.

1824
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:21,663
Amen.

1825
01:23:21,663 --> 01:23:22,664
Amen.

1826
01:23:22,664 --> 01:23:25,667
Amen. Oh, that was beautiful.

1827
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:28,670
The mouse, he churned
that cream into butter.

1828
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:31,172
(sighing happily)

1829
01:23:31,172 --> 01:23:32,173
That's right.

1830
01:23:32,173 --> 01:23:33,675
That's pretty good.

1831
01:23:33,675 --> 01:23:35,176
Thank you.

1832
01:23:35,176 --> 01:23:37,178
Frank, have you decided
which hospital

1833
01:23:37,178 --> 01:23:38,680
you want to work at
here in New Orleans?

1834
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:41,182
Well, um, to be
quite honest

1835
01:23:41,182 --> 01:23:44,185
I'm thinking about
getting back into law.

1836
01:23:44,185 --> 01:23:46,187
Oh, my!

1837
01:23:46,187 --> 01:23:48,189
Are you a doctor
or a lawyer?

1838
01:23:48,189 --> 01:23:50,692
Before I went
to medical school

1839
01:23:50,692 --> 01:23:52,694
I passed the bar
in California.

1840
01:23:52,694 --> 01:23:54,696
I practiced law for one year

1841
01:23:54,696 --> 01:23:58,199
then I decided why not
try my hand at pediatrics?

1842
01:23:58,199 --> 01:24:00,702
You're just
full of surprises.

1843
01:24:00,702 --> 01:24:01,703
Yeah.

1844
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:04,205
MOTHER (laughing):
Oh, my.

1845
01:24:04,205 --> 01:24:05,206
A doctor and a lawyer.

1846
01:24:05,206 --> 01:24:07,208
Well, I'd say that Brenda
hit the jackpot.

1847
01:24:07,208 --> 01:24:10,211
Where did you go
to law school?

1848
01:24:10,211 --> 01:24:12,213
Uh, Berkeley.

1849
01:24:12,213 --> 01:24:13,214
(gasping)

1850
01:24:13,214 --> 01:24:14,716
Berkley, Berkley.
Oh, my gosh.

1851
01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:16,217
Isn't that where
you went, Daddy?

1852
01:24:16,217 --> 01:24:18,219
Maybe Frank could
come work for you, Roger.

1853
01:24:18,219 --> 01:24:19,721
You're always saying
how hard it is

1854
01:24:19,721 --> 01:24:21,222
to find
Assistant Prosecutors.

1855
01:24:21,222 --> 01:24:23,725
Could he, Daddy?
Could he, please?

1856
01:24:23,725 --> 01:24:25,226
Could he come
work with you, please?

1857
01:24:25,226 --> 01:24:27,228
Was that snake Hollingsworth
still teaching there

1858
01:24:27,228 --> 01:24:28,730
when you went
through Berkley?

1859
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:30,231
(laughs quietly)

1860
01:24:30,231 --> 01:24:31,733
Hollingsworth.

1861
01:24:31,733 --> 01:24:34,736
Yes. Grumpy old
Hollingsworth, right?

1862
01:24:34,736 --> 01:24:36,237
I tell you.
Meaner than ever.

1863
01:24:36,738 --> 01:24:38,740
And that dog of his?

1864
01:24:41,242 --> 01:24:45,246
Tell me, Frank, what was
the name of his little dog?

1865
01:24:53,755 --> 01:24:57,258
I'm sorry. Uh...

1866
01:24:57,258 --> 01:24:59,260
The dog was dead.

1867
01:24:59,260 --> 01:25:00,762
(women cooing)

1868
01:25:00,762 --> 01:25:04,265
How unfortunate.

1869
01:25:04,265 --> 01:25:06,267
Yeah.

1870
01:25:36,798 --> 01:25:39,300
A doctor, a lawyer,
a Lutheran...

1871
01:25:42,303 --> 01:25:45,306
So what are you, Frank?

1872
01:25:45,306 --> 01:25:46,808
'Cause I think
you're about to ask

1873
01:25:47,308 --> 01:25:48,810
for my daughter's hand
in marriage

1874
01:25:48,810 --> 01:25:50,311
and I have a right to know.

1875
01:25:50,311 --> 01:25:52,814
Know what, sir?

1876
01:25:52,814 --> 01:25:55,316
The truth.

1877
01:25:55,316 --> 01:25:59,821
Tell me the
truth, Frank.

1878
01:25:59,821 --> 01:26:03,825
What are you
doing here?

1879
01:26:03,825 --> 01:26:06,828
What is a man like you
doing with Brenda?

1880
01:26:06,828 --> 01:26:09,330
If you want my blessing

1881
01:26:09,330 --> 01:26:11,332
if you want my daughter

1882
01:26:11,332 --> 01:26:14,335
I'd like to hear
it from you now.

1883
01:26:17,338 --> 01:26:19,340
The truth is, sir, that...

1884
01:26:22,844 --> 01:26:24,345
The truth is that...

1885
01:26:26,347 --> 01:26:29,851
I'm not a doctor,
I'm not a lawyer...

1886
01:26:32,353 --> 01:26:34,856
I'm not an airline pilot.

1887
01:26:35,356 --> 01:26:38,359
I'm... I'm nothing, really.

1888
01:26:43,865 --> 01:26:47,869
I'm-I'm-I'm just a kid who's
in love with your daughter.

1889
01:26:50,872 --> 01:26:53,374
No.

1890
01:27:01,382 --> 01:27:03,885
You know what you are?

1891
01:27:03,885 --> 01:27:05,887
You're a romantic.

1892
01:27:05,887 --> 01:27:08,890
Men like us are nothing
without the women we love.

1893
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:11,893
I must confess, I'm guilty
of the same foolish whimsy.

1894
01:27:11,893 --> 01:27:13,895
I proposed to Carol
after five dates

1895
01:27:13,895 --> 01:27:17,398
with two nickels in my pockets
and holes in my shoes

1896
01:27:17,398 --> 01:27:19,901
because I knew
she was the one.

1897
01:27:19,901 --> 01:27:22,403
So go ahead, Frank.

1898
01:27:25,406 --> 01:27:27,909
Don't be afraid.

1899
01:27:27,909 --> 01:27:31,412
Ask the question
you came here to ask me.

1900
01:27:33,414 --> 01:27:35,917
Sir, uh, uh...

1901
01:27:35,917 --> 01:27:37,418
w-what would I have to do

1902
01:27:37,418 --> 01:27:39,921
to take the bar
here in New Orleans?

1903
01:27:39,921 --> 01:27:41,923
(laughing)

1904
01:27:44,926 --> 01:27:48,179
No, the... the other question.

1905
01:27:48,179 --> 01:27:51,933
(ticking)

1906
01:27:51,933 --> 01:27:55,937
WOMAN:
Right through
that door.

1907
01:27:55,937 --> 01:27:58,439
Good luck, Mr. Conners.

1908
01:27:58,439 --> 01:28:00,441
Thank you.

1909
01:28:07,949 --> 01:28:09,450
Hey, Frank...

1910
01:28:09,450 --> 01:28:11,452
you know what I could
never figure out?

1911
01:28:11,452 --> 01:28:14,455
How did you cheat on the
bar exam in Louisiana?

1912
01:28:14,455 --> 01:28:16,457
Why? What's the difference?

1913
01:28:16,457 --> 01:28:18,459
Someone else took the test
for you, didn't they?

1914
01:28:18,459 --> 01:28:21,462
Carl, I'm going to prison
for a long time.

1915
01:28:21,462 --> 01:28:23,965
Seriously,
what's the difference?

1916
01:28:23,965 --> 01:28:26,467
It's a simple question.

1917
01:28:26,467 --> 01:28:28,970
Are you going to eat
that eclair?

1918
01:28:31,472 --> 01:28:34,976
Yeah. I'm saving
it for later.

1919
01:28:34,976 --> 01:28:36,978
Well, you want
to split it with me?

1920
01:28:36,978 --> 01:28:40,481
No.

1921
01:28:40,481 --> 01:28:43,985
Give me half that eclair
and I'll tell you.

1922
01:28:53,494 --> 01:28:57,999
I'm going to figure it out
sooner or later.

1923
01:29:04,505 --> 01:29:08,009
You'll be working under
Phillip Rigby in corporate law.

1924
01:29:08,009 --> 01:29:11,012
Why don't you settle in,
organize your desk?

1925
01:29:13,514 --> 01:29:15,016
Thank you.

1926
01:29:15,016 --> 01:29:17,518
We're having lunch at 12:30
with the Attorney General

1927
01:29:17,518 --> 01:29:19,520
and Governor McKeithen.

1928
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:21,022
Himself.

1929
01:29:21,022 --> 01:29:22,523
The Governor.

1930
01:29:22,523 --> 01:29:23,524
Did we
spell it right?

1931
01:29:23,524 --> 01:29:25,360
You sure did.

1932
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:26,861
Congratulations.

1933
01:29:26,861 --> 01:29:28,363
Thank you, sir.

1934
01:29:28,363 --> 01:29:29,364
Welcome aboard.

1935
01:29:29,864 --> 01:29:31,866
Now...

1936
01:29:35,870 --> 01:29:38,373
Look at this photograph,
Mr. Stewart.

1937
01:29:38,373 --> 01:29:41,376
It's a photograph
of Prentice York

1938
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:43,378
where they found him, dead.

1939
01:29:43,378 --> 01:29:47,382
Now, here is an enlargement
of part of that photograph.

1940
01:29:47,382 --> 01:29:49,884
This is a photograph
of the defendant's signature

1941
01:29:49,884 --> 01:29:51,386
on a canceled check.

1942
01:29:51,386 --> 01:29:53,888
Now, here is an enlargement
of that same signature

1943
01:29:53,888 --> 01:29:54,889
which matches

1944
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:58,393
the signature on the letters
that he wrote to Mrs. Simon

1945
01:29:58,393 --> 01:29:59,894
which discuss the possibility

1946
01:29:59,894 --> 01:30:02,397
of defrauding
the great State of Louisiana.

1947
01:30:02,397 --> 01:30:03,398
Your Honor

1948
01:30:03,398 --> 01:30:05,400
ladies and gentlemen of the jury

1949
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:07,402
this is irrefutable evidence

1950
01:30:07,402 --> 01:30:10,405
that the defendant is,
in fact, lying.

1951
01:30:10,905 --> 01:30:12,407
(echoing thud)

1952
01:30:12,407 --> 01:30:14,409
(chair slams against floor)

1953
01:30:15,410 --> 01:30:20,915
Mr. Conners, this is
a preliminary hearing.

1954
01:30:20,915 --> 01:30:24,919
There is no... defendant.

1955
01:30:24,919 --> 01:30:29,424
There is no... jury.

1956
01:30:29,424 --> 01:30:32,427
It's just me.

1957
01:30:32,427 --> 01:30:33,928
Son...

1958
01:30:33,928 --> 01:30:38,433
what in the hell
is wrong with you?!

1959
01:30:38,433 --> 01:30:40,435
(applause over TV)
Is that Mitch?

1960
01:30:40,435 --> 01:30:41,936
Roger! It's Mitch!

1961
01:30:41,936 --> 01:30:43,938
Oh, my, I lost
all track of time.

1962
01:30:43,938 --> 01:30:46,941
MITCH MILLER (on TV):
As studio guests
for the sing-along tonight

1963
01:30:46,941 --> 01:30:48,943
we have the children's choir
of St. Monica's Church

1964
01:30:48,943 --> 01:30:50,945
in New York City.

1965
01:30:50,945 --> 01:30:52,447
Won't you join them and the gang

1966
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:54,949
in a few songs for the Irish?
Everybody!

1967
01:30:54,949 --> 01:30:57,452
? Has anybody here seen Kelly? ?

1968
01:30:57,452 --> 01:31:00,455
(all but Frank joining in):
? K, E, double L, Y ?

1969
01:31:00,455 --> 01:31:02,957
? Has anybody here seen Kelly? ?

1970
01:31:02,957 --> 01:31:04,959
? Have you seen him smile? ?

1971
01:31:04,959 --> 01:31:07,962
? Sure his hair is red,
and his eyes are blue ?

1972
01:31:07,962 --> 01:31:10,465
? And he's Irish
through and through ?

1973
01:31:10,465 --> 01:31:12,967
? Has anybody here seen Kelly ?

1974
01:31:12,967 --> 01:31:15,470
? Kelly from the Emerald Isle? ?

1975
01:31:15,470 --> 01:31:17,972
? Has anybody here seen Kelly? ?

1976
01:31:17,972 --> 01:31:20,475
? K, E, double L, Y ?

1977
01:31:20,475 --> 01:31:22,977
(joining in):
? Has anybody here seen Kelly? ?

1978
01:31:22,977 --> 01:31:25,480
? Have you seen him smile? ?

1979
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:27,982
? Sure his hair is red,
and his eyes are blue ?

1980
01:31:27,982 --> 01:31:30,485
? And he's Irish
through and through ?

1981
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:32,987
? Has anybody here
seen Kelly... ?

1982
01:31:32,987 --> 01:31:35,490
JUDY GARLAND (on record):
? Embrace me ?

1983
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:40,995
? My sweet embraceable you ?

1984
01:31:40,995 --> 01:31:43,998
? Embrace me ?

1985
01:31:43,998 --> 01:31:50,505
? You irreplaceable you ?

1986
01:31:50,505 --> 01:31:53,508
? Just one look at you ?

1987
01:31:53,508 --> 01:31:59,514
? My heart grew tipsy in me ?

1988
01:31:59,514 --> 01:32:02,517
? You and you alone ?

1989
01:32:02,517 --> 01:32:09,023
? Bring out the gypsy in me ?

1990
01:32:09,023 --> 01:32:12,026
? I love all ?

1991
01:32:12,026 --> 01:32:18,533
? The many charms about you ?

1992
01:32:18,533 --> 01:32:21,536
? Above all ?

1993
01:32:21,536 --> 01:32:24,539
? I want my arms about you... ?

1994
01:32:24,539 --> 01:32:26,541
(whispers):
Dad.

1995
01:32:28,042 --> 01:32:31,045
? ...Don't be
a naughty baby... ?

1996
01:32:31,045 --> 01:32:33,047
What are you doing here?

1997
01:32:33,047 --> 01:32:37,552
I... I-I came to see you.

1998
01:32:37,552 --> 01:32:40,555
? ...My sweet embraceable... ?

1999
01:32:40,555 --> 01:32:43,057
What are you doing
dressed like this?

2000
01:32:43,057 --> 01:32:45,059
I took a job.
A government job.

2001
01:32:45,059 --> 01:32:46,060
You see what I'm doing?

2002
01:32:46,561 --> 01:32:48,062
Do you have a good lawyer?

2003
01:32:48,062 --> 01:32:50,565
Well... I sort of am
a lawyer now.

2004
01:32:50,565 --> 01:32:54,569
Look at this letter.
The IRS wants more.

2005
01:32:54,569 --> 01:32:57,071
I had a deal with them:
two penalties.

2006
01:32:57,071 --> 01:33:00,575
They ate the cake,
now they want the crumbs.

2007
01:33:00,575 --> 01:33:03,077
I want to sue them.

2008
01:33:03,077 --> 01:33:06,080
Now they want the crumbs.

2009
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:08,082
They... Here, sit down.

2010
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:11,085
They're trying to scare
me, intimidate me.

2011
01:33:11,085 --> 01:33:13,588
You know what?

2012
01:33:13,588 --> 01:33:17,091
You know what? I'll
make them chase me...

2013
01:33:17,091 --> 01:33:19,594
for the rest
of their lives.

2014
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:29,103
Hey, it's great
to see you, Daddy.

2015
01:33:29,103 --> 01:33:33,608
Listen, sit down, I...
I want to show you something.

2016
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:37,612
I came here
to give you this.

2017
01:33:37,612 --> 01:33:42,116
It's an invitation
to an engagement party.

2018
01:33:43,117 --> 01:33:46,120
Daddy, I'm getting married.

2019
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:49,123
Can you believe that?
I'm getting married.

2020
01:33:49,123 --> 01:33:51,626
You don't need to worry
about anything now, Dad.

2021
01:33:51,626 --> 01:33:53,628
Listen, I'm getting
a brand-new Cadillac.

2022
01:33:53,628 --> 01:33:55,630
I'm getting a $60,000 house.

2023
01:33:55,630 --> 01:33:57,632
I'm-I'm getting it all back.

2024
01:33:57,632 --> 01:34:00,134
All-All the jewelry,
all the furs, everything, Dad.

2025
01:34:00,134 --> 01:34:02,637
Everything they took from us,
I'm going to get it back.

2026
01:34:03,137 --> 01:34:04,639
Now...

2027
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:08,643
has Ma seen you
dressed like this?

2028
01:34:08,643 --> 01:34:12,146
Yeah, she came to
pick up some boxes.

2029
01:34:12,146 --> 01:34:13,648
That's okay, that's okay,
you know why?

2030
01:34:13,648 --> 01:34:15,650
'Cause she... she's going
to the wedding with us.

2031
01:34:16,150 --> 01:34:17,652
I'm going to get you
a brand-new suit, Dad.

2032
01:34:17,652 --> 01:34:19,153
I'm getting you
a brand-new suit.

2033
01:34:19,153 --> 01:34:20,655
One of those
Manhattan Eagle

2034
01:34:20,655 --> 01:34:21,656
three-button
black pearl suits.

2035
01:34:21,656 --> 01:34:22,657
You'll look great.

2036
01:34:22,657 --> 01:34:24,158
Those are nice. Yeah.

2037
01:34:24,158 --> 01:34:27,161
She won't see me.

2038
01:34:28,162 --> 01:34:29,664
Well, have you tried
to call her?

2039
01:34:29,664 --> 01:34:32,166
Uh-uh.

2040
01:34:32,166 --> 01:34:34,669
Why don't... why don't you
call her right now?

2041
01:34:34,669 --> 01:34:37,171
Dad, why don't you
call her right now? Here.

2042
01:34:37,171 --> 01:34:39,173
Dad, just call her.
Call her for me.

2043
01:34:39,173 --> 01:34:41,175
You call her,
and you tell her

2044
01:34:41,175 --> 01:34:43,678
I have two first-class tickets
to go see her son's wedding...

2045
01:34:43,678 --> 01:34:46,681
Your mother's married now,
to my friend Jack Barnes.

2046
01:34:46,681 --> 01:34:49,684
They have a house
in Long Island.

2047
01:34:49,684 --> 01:34:53,688
(whispering):
I had an FBI agent
come see me.

2048
01:34:53,688 --> 01:34:55,690
You got their number, son.

2049
01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:57,692
The guy looked scared.

2050
01:34:57,692 --> 01:35:02,196
The United States government,
champ, running for the hills.

2051
01:35:02,196 --> 01:35:04,699
Pow! To the moon!

2052
01:35:15,710 --> 01:35:18,713
Dad... it's over.

2053
01:35:20,214 --> 01:35:22,216
I'm going to stop now.

2054
01:35:22,216 --> 01:35:24,218
But y-you've...

2055
01:35:24,218 --> 01:35:26,220
They're never going
to catch you, Frank.

2056
01:35:26,220 --> 01:35:28,723
Why won't you
sit down?
Dad, she wouldn't do that.

2057
01:35:28,723 --> 01:35:30,725
Come on, sit.
Why would she do that to you?

2058
01:35:30,725 --> 01:35:32,226
Come on, sit with me.
Have a drink.

2059
01:35:32,226 --> 01:35:33,728
I'm your father.

2060
01:35:33,728 --> 01:35:37,231
Then ask me to stop.

2061
01:35:37,231 --> 01:35:39,233
(quietly):
Then ask me to stop.

2062
01:35:42,236 --> 01:35:44,238
You can't stop.

2063
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:48,242
Where are you going?

2064
01:35:48,242 --> 01:35:50,745
Come on, Frank,
where are you going?

2065
01:35:50,745 --> 01:35:51,746
Where are you going?

2066
01:35:52,246 --> 01:35:53,748
Where are you
going tonight?

2067
01:35:54,248 --> 01:35:55,249
Someplace exotic?

2068
01:35:55,249 --> 01:35:56,751
Where are you
going tonight?

2069
01:35:56,751 --> 01:35:57,752
Tahiti, Hawaii?

2070
01:36:07,762 --> 01:36:11,766
(phone ringing)

2071
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:18,272
This is Hanratty.

2072
01:36:18,272 --> 01:36:20,775
FRANK:
Hello, Carl.

2073
01:36:20,775 --> 01:36:22,777
Merry Christmas.

2074
01:36:22,777 --> 01:36:24,779
How are you, Dr. Conners?

2075
01:36:24,779 --> 01:36:29,283
Carl, I haven't been Dr. Conners
for months now.

2076
01:36:29,283 --> 01:36:31,285
(Hanratty sniffles,
clears throat)

2077
01:36:31,285 --> 01:36:34,288
Well... I'm sitting here
in my office

2078
01:36:34,789 --> 01:36:36,290
on Christmas Eve.

2079
01:36:36,290 --> 01:36:37,792
What do you want?

2080
01:36:37,792 --> 01:36:42,296
(instrumental version "I'll Be
Home for Christmas" playing)

2081
01:36:42,296 --> 01:36:44,799
(sighs):
Okay.

2082
01:36:49,303 --> 01:36:51,305
I want it to be over.

2083
01:36:54,809 --> 01:36:56,811
Uh... I want it to be over.

2084
01:36:56,811 --> 01:36:58,813
I'm getting married.

2085
01:36:58,813 --> 01:37:00,815
You know, I'm settling down.

2086
01:37:00,815 --> 01:37:02,817
You've stolen
almost $4 million.

2087
01:37:02,817 --> 01:37:05,319
You think we can just
call that a wedding present?

2088
01:37:05,319 --> 01:37:08,322
Nah, this isn't something you
get to walk away from, Frank.

2089
01:37:08,322 --> 01:37:09,657
I want to call a truce.

2090
01:37:10,157 --> 01:37:11,158
No truce.

2091
01:37:11,158 --> 01:37:13,160
You will be caught,
you will go to prison.

2092
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:14,662
Where did you think
this was going?

2093
01:37:14,662 --> 01:37:18,165
Please leave me alone, Carl.

2094
01:37:18,165 --> 01:37:19,667
Please?

2095
01:37:19,667 --> 01:37:21,168
I'm getting close,
aren't I?

2096
01:37:21,168 --> 01:37:23,671
You're scared because
I'm getting close.

2097
01:37:23,671 --> 01:37:26,674
I know you... you rented
that car in Shreveport

2098
01:37:26,674 --> 01:37:29,677
and you stayed in that hotel
on Lake Charles.

2099
01:37:29,677 --> 01:37:31,679
You want to run,
be my guest.

2100
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:34,181
Your checks don't lie
as well as you do.

2101
01:37:34,181 --> 01:37:37,184
Stop chasing me.

2102
01:37:39,186 --> 01:37:42,189
I can't stop.

2103
01:37:42,189 --> 01:37:44,692
It's my job.

2104
01:37:44,692 --> 01:37:47,194
It's okay, Carl.

2105
01:37:47,194 --> 01:37:50,698
I just thought I'd ask,
you know?

2106
01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:57,204
Hey. Merry Christmas, huh?

2107
01:37:57,204 --> 01:38:00,207
(click and dial tone)

2108
01:38:00,207 --> 01:38:02,710
I love my job.

2109
01:38:02,710 --> 01:38:04,712
All right... (clears throat)

2110
01:38:04,712 --> 01:38:06,213
let's get every newspaper
we can

2111
01:38:06,213 --> 01:38:08,716
every newspaper in Louisiana
for the last two months.

2112
01:38:08,716 --> 01:38:09,717
What are we
looking for?

2113
01:38:09,717 --> 01:38:12,219
Engagement announcements,
name of Conners.

2114
01:38:12,219 --> 01:38:14,722
Conners?! Come on,
Carl, the kid would've

2115
01:38:14,722 --> 01:38:16,223
changed his name by now.

2116
01:38:16,223 --> 01:38:19,226
Mm-mm. He can't change it.

2117
01:38:19,226 --> 01:38:20,728
She thinks he's Conners.

2118
01:38:20,728 --> 01:38:23,230
If he loses the name,
he loses the girl.

2119
01:38:23,230 --> 01:38:24,732
? I can't give you anything ?

2120
01:38:24,732 --> 01:38:28,736
? But love, baby ?

2121
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:32,740
? That's the only thing
I have plenty of ?

2122
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:33,741
? Baby ?

2123
01:38:33,741 --> 01:38:35,242
? Dreamin' a while,
schemin' a while... ?

2124
01:38:35,242 --> 01:38:36,744
Congratulations.
You having a good time?

2125
01:38:37,244 --> 01:38:40,247
? ...You're sure to find ?

2126
01:38:40,247 --> 01:38:42,750
? Happiness, and I guess ?
Keep dancing, huh?

2127
01:38:43,250 --> 01:38:45,252
? All those things
you've always pined for... ?

2128
01:38:45,252 --> 01:38:47,254
Oh.
Hi.

2129
01:38:47,254 --> 01:38:49,757
Oh, me too. Thank you.
I'm going to, uh,
the little boys' room.

2130
01:38:49,757 --> 01:38:51,258
Okay.
Okay.

2131
01:38:51,258 --> 01:38:52,760
Hurry back.

2132
01:38:58,766 --> 01:39:01,769
(car approaching)

2133
01:39:01,769 --> 01:39:04,772
(brakes squeaking)

2134
01:39:07,274 --> 01:39:08,275
Good evening.

2135
01:39:08,275 --> 01:39:10,277
I'm Agent Hanratty
with the FBI.

2136
01:39:10,277 --> 01:39:12,279
We'd like to have
a few quiet words

2137
01:39:12,279 --> 01:39:13,781
with your host,
if possible.

2138
01:39:13,781 --> 01:39:15,783
MAN:
I'll get him.

2139
01:39:16,784 --> 01:39:18,285
Right over there, sir.

2140
01:39:18,285 --> 01:39:20,788
Hi, Roger.
How are you?
Hi, Vin.

2141
01:39:20,788 --> 01:39:23,290
Good evening, gentlemen.
I'm Roger Strong.

2142
01:39:23,290 --> 01:39:24,792
Carl Hanratty, FBI.

2143
01:39:24,792 --> 01:39:27,294
This is Agents
Amdursky and Fox.

2144
01:39:27,294 --> 01:39:29,296
Sorry to crash
your party, sir.

2145
01:39:29,296 --> 01:39:31,298
Not at all.
What can I do for you?

2146
01:39:31,298 --> 01:39:32,800
If it's not too
much trouble

2147
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:34,802
I'd like to meet
the groom.

2148
01:39:34,802 --> 01:39:37,805
Is there a problem?

2149
01:39:37,805 --> 01:39:39,306
(laughter)
Frank! Frank!

2150
01:39:39,306 --> 01:39:40,808
Can you hold all these?

2151
01:39:40,808 --> 01:39:42,309
(whispering):
Yeah. Come here.

2152
01:39:42,309 --> 01:39:44,812
They're checks.
They're from my dad's friends.

2153
01:39:44,812 --> 01:39:46,814
They're for us, so we can
start a new life... Hey!

2154
01:39:46,814 --> 01:39:48,315
What are you doing?
What's wrong?

2155
01:39:48,315 --> 01:39:50,317
We have to leave.

2156
01:39:50,317 --> 01:39:52,319
What?!

2157
01:39:52,319 --> 01:39:54,321
Brenda, you love me, right?

2158
01:39:54,321 --> 01:39:55,823
Yes.

2159
01:39:55,823 --> 01:39:57,324
I mean, you'd love me
no matter what.

2160
01:39:57,324 --> 01:39:58,325
Yes.

2161
01:39:58,325 --> 01:39:59,827
I mean, you'd love me
whether I was sick

2162
01:39:59,827 --> 01:40:02,329
or whether I was poor
or even if I had
a different name.

2163
01:40:02,329 --> 01:40:03,831
Frank, where'd you get
all that money?

2164
01:40:03,831 --> 01:40:04,832
Brenda, listen.
A name, right?

2165
01:40:04,832 --> 01:40:06,333
A name, it doesn't matter.

2166
01:40:06,333 --> 01:40:07,835
My name is Frank
Conners, right?

2167
01:40:07,835 --> 01:40:09,336
Yes.
That's who I
am with you.

2168
01:40:09,336 --> 01:40:10,337
But-but we all have secrets.

2169
01:40:10,337 --> 01:40:11,839
You know, sometimes
when I travel

2170
01:40:11,839 --> 01:40:14,341
I use the name Frank Taylor.
That-That's my secret.

2171
01:40:14,341 --> 01:40:16,343
Frank Taylor?!
Yeah, Frank
Taylor, you know?

2172
01:40:16,343 --> 01:40:17,344
Frank Black?!
Frank Black.

2173
01:40:17,344 --> 01:40:18,846
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

2174
01:40:18,846 --> 01:40:21,348
Why are you saying all this?

2175
01:40:21,348 --> 01:40:24,351
Brenda... Brenda,
I don't want to lie
to you anymore.

2176
01:40:24,351 --> 01:40:25,853
All right?
I'm not a doctor.

2177
01:40:25,853 --> 01:40:27,354
I never went to
medical school.

2178
01:40:27,354 --> 01:40:30,357
I'm not a lawyer or a Harvard
graduate or a Lutheran.

2179
01:40:30,357 --> 01:40:32,860
Brenda, I ran away from home
a year and a half ago

2180
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:34,862
when I was 16.

2181
01:40:34,862 --> 01:40:37,364
Frank...

2182
01:40:37,364 --> 01:40:39,867
Frank?

2183
01:40:39,867 --> 01:40:41,869
You're not a Lutheran?

2184
01:40:41,869 --> 01:40:44,371
Brenda... you see
all this money?

2185
01:40:44,371 --> 01:40:46,373
You see all this money?
I have more.

2186
01:40:46,373 --> 01:40:48,876
I have plenty more.

2187
01:40:48,876 --> 01:40:49,877
I have enough money

2188
01:40:49,877 --> 01:40:51,879
to last us for the
rest of our lives

2189
01:40:51,879 --> 01:40:53,380
Look.
(gasps)

2190
01:40:53,380 --> 01:40:56,383
Frank, stop teasing me.

2191
01:40:56,383 --> 01:40:57,384
You're Frank Conners.

2192
01:40:57,384 --> 01:41:00,387
You're Frank Conners,
and you're 28 years old and...

2193
01:41:00,387 --> 01:41:01,889
(whispering):
Brenda...

2194
01:41:01,889 --> 01:41:03,891
Why would you lie to me?

2195
01:41:03,891 --> 01:41:06,393
Brenda, Brenda...
I want
to know your name.

2196
01:41:06,393 --> 01:41:08,395
Listen to me, Brenda.
Tell me your name.

2197
01:41:08,395 --> 01:41:09,897
We can live
anywhere we want

2198
01:41:09,897 --> 01:41:11,398
but you have to
trust me, Brenda.

2199
01:41:11,398 --> 01:41:12,900
Do you trust me?
Yes.

2200
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:14,902
Do you... do you
love me, Brenda?
Yes.

2201
01:41:14,902 --> 01:41:16,403
You love me?
I love you.

2202
01:41:16,403 --> 01:41:18,906
Excuse me, Mother.

2203
01:41:18,906 --> 01:41:20,908
Honey, this is Mr. Hanratty.
My wife Carol.

2204
01:41:21,408 --> 01:41:22,910
Oh, Mister...?
Hanratty, ma'am.

2205
01:41:22,910 --> 01:41:23,911
Ratty.
Yes.

2206
01:41:23,911 --> 01:41:25,913
Have you seen
Frank or Brenda?

2207
01:41:25,913 --> 01:41:27,915
I-I think they
went upstairs.

2208
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:34,922
Frank...

2209
01:41:36,924 --> 01:41:38,926
(whispers):
Brenda, come here.

2210
01:41:38,926 --> 01:41:40,928
Okay, in two days,
you're going to meet me

2211
01:41:40,928 --> 01:41:42,930
at Miami International
Airport, all right?

2212
01:41:42,930 --> 01:41:45,432
You're going to leave
the house after your
parents go to sleep.

2213
01:41:45,432 --> 01:41:46,934
You're going to take
a taxicab.

2214
01:41:46,934 --> 01:41:48,435
You give the taxi driver
this money right here

2215
01:41:48,435 --> 01:41:50,437
and you tell him to drive
all through the night.

2216
01:41:50,437 --> 01:41:52,439
Brenda, you're going
to leave at 10:00am.

2217
01:41:52,439 --> 01:41:53,941
10:00am, all right?
But...

2218
01:41:53,941 --> 01:41:56,443
(scatting)

2219
01:41:56,443 --> 01:41:58,946
? I never stop ?

2220
01:41:58,946 --> 01:42:01,949
? Till I get to the top... ?

2221
01:42:01,949 --> 01:42:04,952
(jazz continues in distance)

2222
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:14,962
Which room, sir?

2223
01:42:14,962 --> 01:42:15,963
In the corner.

2224
01:42:15,963 --> 01:42:17,464
You have to listen to me,
all right?
Okay.

2225
01:42:17,464 --> 01:42:19,466
The International Terminal
in Miami, all right? Say it.

2226
01:42:19,466 --> 01:42:20,968
(whimpering):
Okay, the International
Terminal in Miami.

2227
01:42:21,468 --> 01:42:22,469
No matter what...
No matter what...

2228
01:42:22,469 --> 01:42:23,470
You're going to take
a taxicab.

2229
01:42:23,470 --> 01:42:24,471
I will take a taxi.

2230
01:42:24,471 --> 01:42:25,973
You're going to be there
at 10:00am.

2231
01:42:25,973 --> 01:42:27,474
I will be there at
10:00am, no matter what.

2232
01:42:27,474 --> 01:42:28,475
In two days.
Two days.

2233
01:42:28,475 --> 01:42:29,476
Two days, Brenda.
Two days.

2234
01:42:29,476 --> 01:42:30,978
In two days,
I'll be there

2235
01:42:30,978 --> 01:42:32,479
no matter what,
at 10:00am.

2236
01:42:39,486 --> 01:42:40,988
You're not going
to tell anyone, Brenda.

2237
01:42:40,988 --> 01:42:41,989
You have
to promise me, now.

2238
01:42:41,989 --> 01:42:43,490
(crying):
Frank, please!

2239
01:42:43,490 --> 01:42:45,993
Before you go, please
tell me your name.

2240
01:42:45,993 --> 01:42:47,995
Please, tell me.

2241
01:42:47,995 --> 01:42:53,000
Frank William Abagnale Jr.

2242
01:42:55,002 --> 01:42:57,004
(ominous music playing)

2243
01:43:01,008 --> 01:43:03,010
(light, childlike theme plays)

2244
01:43:06,013 --> 01:43:07,764
(wind blowing)

2245
01:43:10,017 --> 01:43:15,022
(ominous theme building)

2246
01:43:15,022 --> 01:43:17,524
(childlike theme returns)

2247
01:43:20,027 --> 01:43:23,030
(shuddering)

2248
01:43:31,538 --> 01:43:34,041
? ?

2249
01:43:40,047 --> 01:43:42,049
WOMAN (over P.A.):
National Airlines

2250
01:43:42,049 --> 01:43:44,551
flight number 27, serving
Fort Myers, Sarasota, Tampa

2251
01:43:44,551 --> 01:43:48,555
and New York Kennedy,
is now available at gate n...

2252
01:43:50,557 --> 01:43:54,561
Skycap, Gate 14.
Skycap, Gate 14.

2253
01:43:54,561 --> 01:43:56,063
Taxi!

2254
01:43:56,063 --> 01:43:59,066
(announcements continue
indistinctly over P.A.)

2255
01:44:06,573 --> 01:44:08,575
MAN (over P.A.):
Your attention...

2256
01:44:18,085 --> 01:44:21,088
? ?

2257
01:44:30,097 --> 01:44:33,100
? ?

2258
01:44:43,110 --> 01:44:46,613
? ?

2259
01:44:55,122 --> 01:44:58,125
? ?

2260
01:45:01,128 --> 01:45:04,131
(sighing)

2261
01:45:04,131 --> 01:45:07,134
Brenda.

2262
01:45:16,977 --> 01:45:18,979
AMDURSKY:
This guy's a no-show.

2263
01:45:18,979 --> 01:45:19,980
He must've got wise to us.

2264
01:45:19,980 --> 01:45:21,982
HANRATTY:
Maybe he was tipped.

2265
01:45:21,982 --> 01:45:23,483
If he's not here today,
he'll be tomorrow.

2266
01:45:23,483 --> 01:45:25,485
We'll get him before
he leaves the country.

2267
01:45:25,485 --> 01:45:26,987
He doesn't have
a passport.

2268
01:45:26,987 --> 01:45:29,489
For the last six months, he's
gone to Harvard and Berkeley.

2269
01:45:29,489 --> 01:45:30,490
I'm betting
he can get a passport.

2270
01:45:30,490 --> 01:45:32,492
So we have all our men
waiting for him here

2271
01:45:32,492 --> 01:45:33,493
in Miami International.

2272
01:45:33,493 --> 01:45:35,495
He's used it before.
He knows the layout.

2273
01:45:35,495 --> 01:45:36,997
I talked to Miami police;
they've offered us

2274
01:45:37,497 --> 01:45:38,999
50 uniformed cops
in two shifts of 25.

2275
01:45:38,999 --> 01:45:41,001
With our guys,
that's almost 100
men in one airport.

2276
01:45:41,001 --> 01:45:43,003
Don't you think
we should spread
it around?

2277
01:45:43,003 --> 01:45:44,504
No, no,
this is the exit point.

2278
01:45:44,504 --> 01:45:47,007
Well, how do you know
he hasn't rented a car

2279
01:45:47,007 --> 01:45:49,009
and driven to airports
in New York, Atlanta?

2280
01:45:49,009 --> 01:45:50,510
Because I'm not in New York.

2281
01:45:50,510 --> 01:45:52,012
I'm not in Atlanta.

2282
01:45:52,012 --> 01:45:53,513
Yes, this is, uh,
Frank Roberts

2283
01:45:54,014 --> 01:45:56,016
and I'm letting
all the universities

2284
01:45:56,016 --> 01:45:58,518
in the area know
that Pan Am will be initiating

2285
01:45:59,019 --> 01:46:01,021
a new recruiting program
this year.

2286
01:46:01,021 --> 01:46:04,024
I'll, uh, be stopping
by your campus tomorrow morning.

2287
01:46:04,024 --> 01:46:07,527
Thank you all very much
for coming.

2288
01:46:07,527 --> 01:46:08,528
At the end of the day

2289
01:46:08,528 --> 01:46:11,531
I'll be choosing eight
young ladies to be a part of...

2290
01:46:11,531 --> 01:46:13,533
(cheering and laughter)

2291
01:46:13,533 --> 01:46:16,036
...Pan Am's future stewardess
flight crew program.

2292
01:46:16,036 --> 01:46:18,538
Now, these eight young ladies
will accompany me

2293
01:46:18,538 --> 01:46:22,042
on a two-month public relations
tour through Europe.

2294
01:46:22,042 --> 01:46:23,043
(women squealing)

2295
01:46:23,043 --> 01:46:26,046
They will discover firsthand
what it takes

2296
01:46:26,046 --> 01:46:28,048
to be a Pan American stewardess.

2297
01:46:28,048 --> 01:46:30,050
(cheering)

2298
01:46:30,050 --> 01:46:32,052
HANRATTY:
Give me at least two men...

2299
01:46:32,052 --> 01:46:35,055
Mm-hmm.
Nah, one man
per every two counters.

2300
01:46:35,055 --> 01:46:36,556
All right?

2301
01:46:36,556 --> 01:46:38,058
Amdursky?

2302
01:46:38,058 --> 01:46:40,060
Yeah?

2303
01:46:40,060 --> 01:46:42,062
Make sure your uniforms
are covering

2304
01:46:42,062 --> 01:46:44,064
the sidewalk entrances
and exits.

2305
01:46:44,064 --> 01:46:47,567
Hey... let's have, uh, periodic
sweeps of the men's lav.

2306
01:46:47,567 --> 01:46:50,070
You, here.

2307
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:54,074
What qualifies me
to be a future stewardess?

2308
01:46:54,074 --> 01:46:56,576
Well, I think that
I'm really friendly

2309
01:46:56,576 --> 01:46:58,578
and I can really help out

2310
01:46:58,578 --> 01:47:02,082
and, um, make people
feel welcome on the plane and...

2311
01:47:02,082 --> 01:47:04,584
We'll be traveling
at 6,000 miles per hour

2312
01:47:04,584 --> 01:47:06,086
at an altitude of 300 feet.

2313
01:47:06,086 --> 01:47:11,591
? All my bags are packed,
I'm ready to go... ?

2314
01:47:11,591 --> 01:47:13,593
(playing dramatic piano intro)

2315
01:47:13,593 --> 01:47:15,095
Ilene Anderson.

2316
01:47:15,095 --> 01:47:17,597
(squealing and applause)

2317
01:47:17,597 --> 01:47:22,602
(pianist playing
"Come Fly With Me")

2318
01:47:22,602 --> 01:47:25,105
Miggy Acker.

2319
01:47:25,105 --> 01:47:27,607
(excited squealing)

2320
01:47:29,109 --> 01:47:31,611
Debra Jo McMillan.

2321
01:47:37,617 --> 01:47:39,619
Candy Heston.

2322
01:47:39,619 --> 01:47:47,627
FRANK SINATRA:
? Come fly with me,
let's fly, let's fly away ?

2323
01:47:47,627 --> 01:47:50,630
? If you can use
some exotic booze ?

2324
01:47:50,630 --> 01:47:54,634
? There's a bar in far Bombay ?

2325
01:47:54,634 --> 01:48:02,142
? Come fly with me,
let's fly, let's fly away ?

2326
01:48:02,142 --> 01:48:05,645
? Come fly with me,
let's float down to Peru ?

2327
01:48:08,648 --> 01:48:11,651
? In llama land
there's a one-man band ?

2328
01:48:11,651 --> 01:48:15,155
? And he'll toot his flute
for you ?

2329
01:48:15,155 --> 01:48:16,656
(appreciative whistle)

2330
01:48:16,656 --> 01:48:18,158
? Come fly with me... ?

2331
01:48:18,158 --> 01:48:19,159
Hi.

2332
01:48:19,159 --> 01:48:21,661
? ...Let's take off
in the blue ?

2333
01:48:21,661 --> 01:48:25,165
? Once I get you up there ?

2334
01:48:25,165 --> 01:48:27,667
? Where the air is rarefied ?

2335
01:48:27,667 --> 01:48:29,669
(wolf whistle)

2336
01:48:29,669 --> 01:48:36,176
? We'll just glide starry-eyed ?

2337
01:48:36,176 --> 01:48:39,179
? Once I get you up there... ?

2338
01:48:39,179 --> 01:48:40,680
You see that blonde
out front?

2339
01:48:40,680 --> 01:48:41,681
I should have been a pilot.

2340
01:48:41,681 --> 01:48:43,683
Exactly.

2341
01:48:43,683 --> 01:48:45,185
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Mr. Carl Hanratty

2342
01:48:45,185 --> 01:48:46,686
please pick up
the courtesy telephone.

2343
01:48:46,686 --> 01:48:47,687
Hanratty.

2344
01:48:47,687 --> 01:48:49,689
AMDURSKY:
Carl, your walkie-talkie
wasn't working.

2345
01:48:49,689 --> 01:48:51,191
There's a guy
in a Pan Am uniform

2346
01:48:51,191 --> 01:48:54,194
sitting in a white Coupe DeVille
out in front of Terminal J.

2347
01:48:54,194 --> 01:48:55,195
That's the charter terminal.

2348
01:48:55,195 --> 01:48:56,696
Can you get a look at his face?

2349
01:48:56,696 --> 01:48:57,697
He's got his pilot's cap on.

2350
01:48:57,697 --> 01:48:59,199
Carl, I think it's him!

2351
01:48:59,199 --> 01:49:01,201
? ...Just say the words,
and we'll beat the birds ?

2352
01:49:01,201 --> 01:49:02,702
? Down to Acapulco Bay... ?

2353
01:49:02,702 --> 01:49:04,204
(siren blaring)

2354
01:49:04,204 --> 01:49:05,705
Watch out, watch out,
watch out!

2355
01:49:05,705 --> 01:49:09,709
? ...It's perfect for a flying
honeymoon, they say... ?

2356
01:49:09,709 --> 01:49:11,711
(agents shouting)

2357
01:49:11,711 --> 01:49:13,213
Out of the car, Frank.

2358
01:49:13,213 --> 01:49:14,714
(patrol cars' tires squealing)

2359
01:49:14,714 --> 01:49:15,715
Frank?!

2360
01:49:15,715 --> 01:49:17,717
Step out of the car!

2361
01:49:17,717 --> 01:49:20,220
Keep your hands
where I can see 'em.

2362
01:49:20,220 --> 01:49:21,721
Don't shoot me!
I'm just a driver.

2363
01:49:21,721 --> 01:49:23,723
A man paid me $100
to wear this uniform

2364
01:49:24,224 --> 01:49:25,225
and pick someone up
at the airport.

2365
01:49:25,225 --> 01:49:26,226
Who you picking up?

2366
01:49:27,227 --> 01:49:28,228
Hey!

2367
01:49:31,731 --> 01:49:37,237
? Pack up, let's fly away. ?

2368
01:49:39,739 --> 01:49:42,742
(engine roaring)

2369
01:49:52,535 --> 01:49:54,921
HANRATTY:
South America, Australia,
Singapore, Egypt.

2370
01:49:54,921 --> 01:49:56,923
The kid's gone
completely out of control.

2371
01:49:56,923 --> 01:49:57,924
Why wasn't I called?

2372
01:49:57,924 --> 01:49:59,426
FOX:
Nobody was called, sir.

2373
01:49:59,426 --> 01:50:02,929
The banks didn't know what
was happening till last week.

2374
01:50:02,929 --> 01:50:03,930
That's impossible.

2375
01:50:03,930 --> 01:50:05,432
They didn't call
'cause it's not counterfeiting.

2376
01:50:05,932 --> 01:50:07,434
It's something else.
Well, what is he doing?

2377
01:50:07,434 --> 01:50:08,435
He's making real checks, sir.

2378
01:50:08,435 --> 01:50:09,436
These are so perfect

2379
01:50:09,436 --> 01:50:10,937
the airline didn't know
the difference.

2380
01:50:10,937 --> 01:50:12,939
Last check was cashed
in Madrid a week ago.

2381
01:50:12,939 --> 01:50:13,940
My guess is
he's still there.

2382
01:50:13,940 --> 01:50:15,442
We have to leave now, sir.
Today.

2383
01:50:15,442 --> 01:50:16,943
Go where?

2384
01:50:16,943 --> 01:50:18,445
Spain? You want
to go to Spain?

2385
01:50:18,445 --> 01:50:19,946
Well, eventually,
he's got to go back

2386
01:50:19,946 --> 01:50:20,947
to where the checks
were printed.

2387
01:50:21,448 --> 01:50:22,949
I think that's why
he's moving back through Europe.

2388
01:50:23,450 --> 01:50:24,951
Look at the map, sir.
He's making a circle.

2389
01:50:24,951 --> 01:50:25,952
He's running out of checks.

2390
01:50:25,952 --> 01:50:27,454
I know it's a...
it's a long shot, sir

2391
01:50:27,454 --> 01:50:29,956
but if we track him from Madrid,
sir, we could still catch him.

2392
01:50:29,956 --> 01:50:31,958
I'm sorry, Carl,
if you couldn't catch him here

2393
01:50:31,958 --> 01:50:32,959
you're not going
to catch him there.

2394
01:50:32,959 --> 01:50:34,961
But, sir, we're going
to let him get away.

2395
01:50:34,961 --> 01:50:38,465
No, Carl, you let him get away.

2396
01:50:47,974 --> 01:50:50,977
(tapping map)

2397
01:51:00,987 --> 01:51:03,990
? ?

2398
01:51:12,999 --> 01:51:16,002
? ?

2399
01:51:19,506 --> 01:51:25,011
A perfect one-16th
all the way around.

2400
01:51:25,011 --> 01:51:27,013
Hmm!

2401
01:51:27,013 --> 01:51:29,516
Color separation
is flawless.

2402
01:51:32,018 --> 01:51:34,020
There's no bleeding. Hmm.

2403
01:51:34,020 --> 01:51:36,523
Nobody does work like this
in the States.

2404
01:51:36,523 --> 01:51:38,024
Nobody but us.

2405
01:51:38,024 --> 01:51:40,026
HANRATTY:
Where was it printed?

2406
01:51:40,026 --> 01:51:42,028
(chuckling):
It was printed
on a monster...

2407
01:51:42,028 --> 01:51:43,029
A monster.

2408
01:51:43,029 --> 01:51:44,531
...a Heidelberg,
an Istra...

2409
01:51:44,531 --> 01:51:46,032
Heidelberg.

2410
01:51:46,032 --> 01:51:47,534
...a dinosaur,
four colors.

2411
01:51:47,534 --> 01:51:49,035
You can smell
the weight.

2412
01:51:49,035 --> 01:51:50,537
Two tons,
without the ink.

2413
01:51:50,537 --> 01:51:52,038
(inhales, clears throat)

2414
01:51:52,038 --> 01:51:54,541
Where do they do printing
like this?

2415
01:51:54,541 --> 01:51:56,042
Germany, Great Britain...

2416
01:51:56,042 --> 01:51:57,043
France.

2417
01:51:57,043 --> 01:51:59,546
BOTH PRINTERS:
France!

2418
01:51:59,546 --> 01:52:02,048
France. Frank's mother said
the name of a village in France

2419
01:52:02,048 --> 01:52:03,049
where they didn't have Sara Lee.

2420
01:52:03,049 --> 01:52:04,551
The village where
she met Frank's father.

2421
01:52:04,551 --> 01:52:06,052
Oh, yeah,
I don't remember, uh...

2422
01:52:06,052 --> 01:52:08,054
It started with an M.
It was, uh, "Mont" something.

2423
01:52:08,054 --> 01:52:09,055
"Mont." Mr. Fox?

2424
01:52:09,055 --> 01:52:10,056
Uh, yes, yes.

2425
01:52:10,056 --> 01:52:12,058
Question: "You met your husband
during the war?"

2426
01:52:12,058 --> 01:52:14,060
Answer: "Yes, I lived
in a small village in France.

2427
01:52:14,060 --> 01:52:15,061
Yeah, right.

2428
01:52:15,061 --> 01:52:17,564
"The kind of place where
they never heard of Sara Lee."

2429
01:52:17,564 --> 01:52:18,565
Tell me you wrote down

2430
01:52:18,565 --> 01:52:20,066
the name of the
village, Mr. Fox.

2431
01:52:20,066 --> 01:52:23,570
Montrichard.

2432
01:52:23,570 --> 01:52:28,074
CHORUS (in distance):
? Laeti triumphantes ?

2433
01:52:28,074 --> 01:52:32,579
? Venite, venite ?

2434
01:52:32,579 --> 01:52:38,084
? In Bethlehem ?

2435
01:52:38,084 --> 01:52:42,589
? Natum videte ?

2436
01:52:42,589 --> 01:52:47,594
? Regem angelorum ?

2437
01:52:47,594 --> 01:52:52,599
? Venite adoremus ?

2438
01:52:52,599 --> 01:52:58,104
? Venite adoremus ?

2439
01:52:58,104 --> 01:53:00,106
? Venite... ?

2440
01:53:00,106 --> 01:53:03,109
(rhythmic clattering)

2441
01:53:15,121 --> 01:53:16,456
(bell ringing)

2442
01:53:16,456 --> 01:53:17,957
(thumping and fluttering)

2443
01:53:17,957 --> 01:53:19,459
(clattering slows)

2444
01:53:19,459 --> 01:53:20,460
Carl?

2445
01:53:20,460 --> 01:53:21,461
Carl!

2446
01:53:22,962 --> 01:53:24,464
Merry Christmas!

2447
01:53:24,464 --> 01:53:27,467
How is it that we're always
talking on Christmas, Carl?

2448
01:53:27,467 --> 01:53:28,968
Every Christmas
I'm talking to you!

2449
01:53:28,968 --> 01:53:30,470
(laughing)

2450
01:53:30,470 --> 01:53:32,472
Put your shirt on, Frank.
You're under arrest.

2451
01:53:32,472 --> 01:53:34,474
Hey, are you hungry?
Do you want some beans, Carl?

2452
01:53:34,474 --> 01:53:35,975
They got the best
French beans here.

2453
01:53:35,975 --> 01:53:36,976
Here, give these
a try.

2454
01:53:36,976 --> 01:53:38,478
There's two dozen French
police officers outside.

2455
01:53:38,978 --> 01:53:40,480
Carl, I gotta tell you,
they're delicious.

2456
01:53:40,480 --> 01:53:41,481
They wanted
to bring you in.

2457
01:53:41,481 --> 01:53:42,982
You want a bite?

2458
01:53:42,982 --> 01:53:44,484
But they needed the help
of an American.

2459
01:53:44,484 --> 01:53:45,485
Are you hungry?
You want a bite?

2460
01:53:45,485 --> 01:53:46,986
But I told them
I wouldn't bring them to you

2461
01:53:47,487 --> 01:53:48,988
unless I could put the cuffs
on you myself.

2462
01:53:48,988 --> 01:53:50,490
Well, you have a gun?
You have a gun?

2463
01:53:50,490 --> 01:53:51,491
No gun? No.

2464
01:53:51,491 --> 01:53:52,992
No gun.

2465
01:53:54,494 --> 01:53:55,995
And-and you're...
and you're telling me what?

2466
01:53:55,995 --> 01:53:57,497
There's, uh,
there's uh... (chuckles)

2467
01:53:57,497 --> 01:53:59,499
there's two dozen
French police officers out there

2468
01:53:59,499 --> 01:54:00,500
right now
on Christmas Eve?

2469
01:54:00,500 --> 01:54:02,001
That's what
you're telling me?

2470
01:54:02,001 --> 01:54:03,002
Yeah.

2471
01:54:03,002 --> 01:54:04,504
(chuckling):
All right, all right.

2472
01:54:04,504 --> 01:54:06,506
Well, there's no windows here.

2473
01:54:06,506 --> 01:54:09,008
I'm going to take a look
out the front door.

2474
01:54:09,008 --> 01:54:10,009
No! No!

2475
01:54:10,009 --> 01:54:11,511
I told them
I'd walk out first

2476
01:54:11,511 --> 01:54:13,012
and give a signal.

2477
01:54:13,012 --> 01:54:14,514
Here, you can put
these on yourself.

2478
01:54:14,514 --> 01:54:16,015
No, I can't do that!
I can't do that.

2479
01:54:16,015 --> 01:54:17,016
You know why?

2480
01:54:17,016 --> 01:54:18,017
(panting)

2481
01:54:18,017 --> 01:54:19,519
'Cause I think
you're full of shit.

2482
01:54:19,519 --> 01:54:22,021
I don't... I don't think
there's anyone else out there.

2483
01:54:22,021 --> 01:54:24,023
I think... I think
it's just me and you.

2484
01:54:24,023 --> 01:54:25,525
That's right.

2485
01:54:25,525 --> 01:54:27,527
I think it's just me and you,
and you know what?

2486
01:54:27,527 --> 01:54:29,028
You're going to have
to catch me yourself!

2487
01:54:29,028 --> 01:54:32,031
I wo... we don't have time
for this.

2488
01:54:32,031 --> 01:54:34,033
Ah, that's good.
That's good.

2489
01:54:34,033 --> 01:54:37,036
Tell me what
you want me to see, huh?

2490
01:54:37,036 --> 01:54:38,037
I wouldn't lie to you.

2491
01:54:38,037 --> 01:54:39,539
Look, you're wearing
a wedding ring.

2492
01:54:39,539 --> 01:54:41,040
You're wearing
a wedding ring, Carl!

2493
01:54:41,040 --> 01:54:42,041
You lied to me about that!

2494
01:54:42,041 --> 01:54:43,543
Didn't you lie
about that?!

2495
01:54:43,543 --> 01:54:45,545
You asked me if I had a family.

2496
01:54:45,545 --> 01:54:47,046
I did, but I don't anymore.

2497
01:54:47,046 --> 01:54:49,048
(phone ringing)

2498
01:54:49,048 --> 01:54:51,551
(anxious breathing)

2499
01:54:53,553 --> 01:54:55,555
(ringing continues)

2500
01:54:55,555 --> 01:54:57,557
Yes? No, no, no,
there is no problem.

2501
01:54:57,557 --> 01:54:59,058
We're coming out right now.

2502
01:54:59,058 --> 01:55:01,060
(laughing)

2503
01:55:01,060 --> 01:55:03,062
Whoa, that was good.
That was good.

2504
01:55:03,062 --> 01:55:05,064
What, did you...
you pay some hotel desk clerk

2505
01:55:05,064 --> 01:55:07,066
to make that call for you,
is that what you did?

2506
01:55:07,066 --> 01:55:08,067
It was Captain Luc.

2507
01:55:08,067 --> 01:55:09,569
I've got one minute
to bring you out.

2508
01:55:09,569 --> 01:55:10,570
Captain Luc? Captain Luc!

2509
01:55:10,570 --> 01:55:11,571
Ooh, Captain Luc.

2510
01:55:11,571 --> 01:55:13,072
Well, Carl, I gotta say

2511
01:55:13,072 --> 01:55:15,074
that-that sounds
pretty official to me

2512
01:55:15,074 --> 01:55:17,577
but like I said, I...
I think it's just

2513
01:55:17,577 --> 01:55:18,578
me and you here,
it's me and you.

2514
01:55:18,578 --> 01:55:20,079
So you're going to
have to catch me.

2515
01:55:20,079 --> 01:55:21,080
Frank. Frank!

2516
01:55:21,080 --> 01:55:23,082
You have to trust me
on this!

2517
01:55:23,082 --> 01:55:26,085
These people
have been embarrassed, Frank.

2518
01:55:26,085 --> 01:55:27,086
They're angry.

2519
01:55:27,086 --> 01:55:29,088
You rob their banks,
you steal their money

2520
01:55:29,088 --> 01:55:30,089
you live in their country.

2521
01:55:30,089 --> 01:55:32,091
I told you this was
what was going to happen

2522
01:55:32,091 --> 01:55:33,593
that there was no other way
for it to end.

2523
01:55:33,593 --> 01:55:36,596
Don't make a mistake!

2524
01:55:36,596 --> 01:55:37,597
That's good.

2525
01:55:37,597 --> 01:55:40,099
That's good, Carl,
you know?

2526
01:55:40,099 --> 01:55:41,100
Keep pushing that lie.

2527
01:55:41,100 --> 01:55:42,101
Keep pushing it.

2528
01:55:42,101 --> 01:55:43,603
Keep pushing
till you make it true.

2529
01:55:43,603 --> 01:55:46,105
They're going
to kill you!

2530
01:55:46,105 --> 01:55:49,108
You walk out that door,
they're going to kill you.

2531
01:55:49,108 --> 01:55:51,110
(panting)

2532
01:55:53,613 --> 01:55:56,115
Is that the truth?

2533
01:55:59,619 --> 01:56:02,121
Yeah.

2534
01:56:05,625 --> 01:56:08,628
You have any children, Carl?

2535
01:56:08,628 --> 01:56:12,131
I have a four-year-old daughter.

2536
01:56:12,131 --> 01:56:14,634
You swear
on your daughter?

2537
01:56:16,636 --> 01:56:19,138
You swear?

2538
01:56:23,643 --> 01:56:26,646
You swear?

2539
01:56:26,646 --> 01:56:29,148
(handcuffs clacking)

2540
01:56:37,156 --> 01:56:41,661
CHORUS:
? Redit ce chant melodieux ?

2541
01:56:41,661 --> 01:56:49,669
? Gloria ?

2542
01:56:49,669 --> 01:56:53,172
? In excelsius Deo ?

2543
01:56:53,172 --> 01:56:56,676
? Gloria... ?

2544
01:56:56,676 --> 01:56:58,678
That was really good, Carl.

2545
01:56:58,678 --> 01:57:01,681
(car approaching)

2546
01:57:01,681 --> 01:57:03,683
(sirens blaring)

2547
01:57:03,683 --> 01:57:05,685
(chorus continues singing)

2548
01:57:05,685 --> 01:57:07,186
(tires screeching)

2549
01:57:07,186 --> 01:57:08,187
(officer shouting in French)

2550
01:57:08,187 --> 01:57:09,188
I have him in custody.

2551
01:57:09,188 --> 01:57:10,690
I got him.

2552
01:57:10,690 --> 01:57:12,191
I got him!
It's all right!

2553
01:57:12,191 --> 01:57:13,693
(shouting continues)

2554
01:57:13,693 --> 01:57:14,694
It's all right!

2555
01:57:14,694 --> 01:57:16,696
I got him!

2556
01:57:16,696 --> 01:57:17,697
(speaking in French)

2557
01:57:17,697 --> 01:57:19,699
(officer shouting excitedly)

2558
01:57:19,699 --> 01:57:22,201
Hey, I want it...
I want it on the record.

2559
01:57:22,201 --> 01:57:24,704
Frank Abagnale surrendered
of his own accord.

2560
01:57:24,704 --> 01:57:27,206
Understood?
Understood?

2561
01:57:27,206 --> 01:57:28,207
Where are you taking him?

2562
01:57:28,207 --> 01:57:29,208
(speaking in French)

2563
01:57:29,208 --> 01:57:30,209
I'm... I'm
supposed to go.

2564
01:57:30,209 --> 01:57:31,711
Where are you
taking him?

2565
01:57:31,711 --> 01:57:33,212
Let me in the...

2566
01:57:33,212 --> 01:57:34,213
Let me in the car!

2567
01:57:34,213 --> 01:57:35,214
(shouting continues)

2568
01:57:35,214 --> 01:57:37,717
Hey! Let me in the car!

2569
01:57:37,717 --> 01:57:38,718
? Gloria... ?

2570
01:57:38,718 --> 01:57:39,719
(engine starts)

2571
01:57:39,719 --> 01:57:41,220
Don't worry, Frank!

2572
01:57:41,220 --> 01:57:43,222
I'll have you extradited
back to the United States.

2573
01:57:43,222 --> 01:57:44,223
Don't worry.

2574
01:57:44,223 --> 01:57:46,726
(siren wailing)

2575
01:57:49,228 --> 01:57:57,737
? Gloria ?

2576
01:57:57,737 --> 01:58:04,744
? In excelsius Deo. ?

2577
01:58:04,744 --> 01:58:07,747
Carl...

2578
01:58:07,747 --> 01:58:10,249
Carl, you have
to remember

2579
01:58:10,249 --> 01:58:13,753
to let me call my father
when we land.

2580
01:58:13,753 --> 01:58:15,755
I just want to,
I want to talk to him

2581
01:58:15,755 --> 01:58:18,758
before he sees me on television
or something like that.

2582
01:58:28,768 --> 01:58:30,269
Carl, look.

2583
01:58:30,269 --> 01:58:32,772
That's LaGuardia right there.

2584
01:58:32,772 --> 01:58:34,273
Runway 4-4.

2585
01:58:34,273 --> 01:58:36,776
Frank, your
father is dead.

2586
01:58:36,776 --> 01:58:38,778
I'm sorry.

2587
01:58:38,778 --> 01:58:40,780
I didn't want
to say anything

2588
01:58:40,780 --> 01:58:42,782
till we got
closer to home.

2589
01:58:42,782 --> 01:58:45,284
He-He... He fell
down some steps

2590
01:58:45,284 --> 01:58:49,288
at Grand Central Station
trying to catch a train.

2591
01:58:49,288 --> 01:58:51,791
I didn't want to be
the one to tell you.

2592
01:58:51,791 --> 01:58:55,294
You're lying, right?

2593
01:58:55,294 --> 01:58:57,296
You said
I could talk to him.

2594
01:58:57,296 --> 01:58:58,297
Carl, who are you to...

2595
01:58:58,297 --> 01:59:00,299
who are you to say
something like that, huh?

2596
01:59:00,299 --> 01:59:02,301
Who are you
to say something like that?

2597
01:59:02,301 --> 01:59:03,302
You said
I could talk to him.

2598
01:59:03,302 --> 01:59:05,304
He fell, and he...
and he broke his neck.

2599
01:59:05,304 --> 01:59:07,807
I'm sorry.

2600
01:59:07,807 --> 01:59:10,309
I'm really sorry.

2601
01:59:17,817 --> 01:59:20,820
(panting)

2602
01:59:20,820 --> 01:59:21,821
(hits seat)

2603
01:59:21,821 --> 01:59:23,823
(sobbing):
Goddamn it!

2604
01:59:23,823 --> 01:59:25,825
Carl, I'm going to be sick!

2605
01:59:25,825 --> 01:59:27,326
(people muttering)
It's all right.

2606
01:59:27,326 --> 01:59:28,327
It's all right.
It's okay.

2607
01:59:28,327 --> 01:59:29,829
Carl, I got to go
to the bathroom.

2608
01:59:29,829 --> 01:59:30,830
I'm going to be sick.

2609
01:59:30,830 --> 01:59:32,331
Sure.
Let's go in the bathroom.

2610
01:59:33,833 --> 01:59:35,835
(panting)

2611
01:59:39,338 --> 01:59:40,840
Goddamn it!

2612
01:59:40,840 --> 01:59:44,844
(sobbing)

2613
01:59:44,844 --> 01:59:46,345
(pounding)

2614
01:59:46,345 --> 01:59:47,847
(murmuring)

2615
01:59:47,847 --> 01:59:50,349
(panting)

2616
01:59:50,349 --> 01:59:52,852
(panting slows)

2617
01:59:53,853 --> 01:59:55,855
(Frank panting)

2618
01:59:58,357 --> 02:00:01,360
(whispering):
Oh, Daddy...

2619
02:00:03,863 --> 02:00:05,364
You'll have take your seat, sir.

2620
02:00:05,865 --> 02:00:07,366
I've told you twice.
We're landing.

2621
02:00:07,366 --> 02:00:08,868
Sorry. Thank you...
All of you.

2622
02:00:08,868 --> 02:00:09,869
Frank! Come on now.

2623
02:00:09,869 --> 02:00:11,370
Frank?
We're landing in six minutes.

2624
02:00:11,370 --> 02:00:12,872
All of you need to be
in your seats

2625
02:00:12,872 --> 02:00:15,374
Frank, open the door!
with your seat belts fastened.

2626
02:00:15,374 --> 02:00:16,876
Frank!

2627
02:00:18,878 --> 02:00:20,379
You do it.
Yeah.

2628
02:00:32,892 --> 02:00:35,394
(engines decelerating)

2629
02:00:41,901 --> 02:00:44,403
(grunting)

2630
02:00:47,406 --> 02:00:48,407
(frustrated sigh)

2631
02:00:48,407 --> 02:00:49,909
(grunting)

2632
02:00:49,909 --> 02:00:51,911
Frank! Frank!

2633
02:00:51,911 --> 02:00:53,913
(engines roaring)

2634
02:00:53,913 --> 02:00:56,415
(tires squealing)

2635
02:00:56,415 --> 02:00:58,918
HANRATTY:
All right, remain seated,
everyone, please.

2636
02:00:58,918 --> 02:01:00,920
FBI. Stay seated.
FBI. Stay seated.

2637
02:01:00,920 --> 02:01:03,923
(engines whining)

2638
02:01:08,928 --> 02:01:10,429
Please remain seated!
Stay seated.

2639
02:01:10,429 --> 02:01:11,931
STEWARDESS:
You must stay seated

2640
02:01:11,931 --> 02:01:14,433
until the aircraft
has come to a complete stop.

2641
02:01:14,433 --> 02:01:15,935
HANRATTY:
God almighty.

2642
02:01:15,935 --> 02:01:19,939
NAT KING COLE:
? Chestnuts roasting
on an open fire... ?

2643
02:01:19,939 --> 02:01:22,942
(panting)

2644
02:01:22,942 --> 02:01:30,116
? Jack Frost nipping
at your nose ?

2645
02:01:30,116 --> 02:01:35,621
? Yuletide carols
being sung by a choir ?

2646
02:01:35,621 --> 02:01:41,127
? And folks dressed up
like Eskimos ?

2647
02:01:41,127 --> 02:01:44,130
? Everybody knows ?

2648
02:01:44,130 --> 02:01:49,635
? A turkey and some mistletoe ?

2649
02:01:49,635 --> 02:01:54,140
? Help to make
the season bright ?

2650
02:01:54,140 --> 02:01:56,642
(quietly blowing notes)

2651
02:01:56,642 --> 02:02:01,147
? Tiny tots with their eyes
all aglow ?

2652
02:02:01,147 --> 02:02:05,151
? Will find it hard
to sleep tonight... ?

2653
02:02:05,151 --> 02:02:07,153
What's your name?

2654
02:02:07,153 --> 02:02:10,156
(blows note)
? They know that Santa's
on his way... ?

2655
02:02:10,156 --> 02:02:13,659
Where's your mommy?

2656
02:02:13,659 --> 02:02:18,164
? ...He's loaded lots of toys
and goodies on his sleigh ?

2657
02:02:18,164 --> 02:02:21,167
(blows note)

2658
02:02:21,167 --> 02:02:26,672
? And every mother's child
is gonna spy ?

2659
02:02:26,672 --> 02:02:29,175
? To see if reindeer
really know how to fly... ?

2660
02:02:29,175 --> 02:02:32,178
(brakes squeaking)

2661
02:02:32,178 --> 02:02:37,683
? And so I'm offering
this simple phrase... ?

2662
02:02:37,683 --> 02:02:40,686
(men shouting indistinctly)

2663
02:02:40,686 --> 02:02:47,193
? To kids from one to 92 ?

2664
02:02:47,193 --> 02:02:50,696
? Although it's been said
many times ?

2665
02:02:50,696 --> 02:02:54,200
? Many ways:
"Merry Christmas..." ?

2666
02:02:54,200 --> 02:02:55,701
Hands behind your head!

2667
02:02:55,701 --> 02:02:57,703
? ...To you. ?

2668
02:02:57,703 --> 02:02:59,205
Carl, get me in the car,
please.

2669
02:02:59,205 --> 02:03:02,708
Get me in the car.

2670
02:03:02,708 --> 02:03:04,710
HANRATTY:
Put him in.

2671
02:03:04,710 --> 02:03:07,713
(piano playing interlude
in "The Christmas Song")

2672
02:03:07,713 --> 02:03:09,715
(handcuffs latching)

2673
02:03:19,225 --> 02:03:20,726
? ?

2674
02:03:20,726 --> 02:03:24,230
JUDGE:
Taking into account
the gravity of these crimes

2675
02:03:24,230 --> 02:03:28,234
your history of bold
and elusive behavior

2676
02:03:28,234 --> 02:03:30,236
and your complete lack
of respect

2677
02:03:30,236 --> 02:03:32,738
for the laws
of the United States

2678
02:03:32,738 --> 02:03:36,242
I have no choice
but to ignore your request

2679
02:03:36,242 --> 02:03:38,244
to be treated as a minor

2680
02:03:38,244 --> 02:03:39,745
and sentence you to 12 years

2681
02:03:39,745 --> 02:03:43,249
in Atlanta's
maximum security prison

2682
02:03:43,249 --> 02:03:46,752
and recommend strongly
that you be kept in isolation

2683
02:03:46,752 --> 02:03:48,754
for the entirety
of that sentence.

2684
02:03:48,754 --> 02:03:52,258
? ..."Merry Christmas to you." ?

2685
02:03:52,258 --> 02:03:55,761
(song ends with guitar playing
"Jingle Bells" riff)

2686
02:04:01,016 --> 02:04:03,018
Use that door
over there.

2687
02:04:03,018 --> 02:04:05,521
(phone ringing)

2688
02:04:05,521 --> 02:04:08,524
(indistinct voices)

2689
02:04:08,524 --> 02:04:10,526
PRISONER:
...and give
everyone my love.

2690
02:04:10,526 --> 02:04:12,528
I think about them
all the time.

2691
02:04:23,038 --> 02:04:25,040
(indistinct conversations
in distance)

2692
02:04:29,545 --> 02:04:31,046
(sighs deeply)

2693
02:04:31,046 --> 02:04:33,299
Merry Christmas, Frank.

2694
02:04:35,551 --> 02:04:38,554
Hey, I got you
some comic books here.

2695
02:04:45,060 --> 02:04:46,061
How's your daughter?

2696
02:04:46,562 --> 02:04:47,563
What was her name?

2697
02:04:47,563 --> 02:04:48,564
Grace.

2698
02:04:48,564 --> 02:04:50,065
Well... I don't know.

2699
02:04:50,065 --> 02:04:52,067
She lives with her mother
in Chicago

2700
02:04:52,067 --> 02:04:54,069
and I don't
get to see her much.

2701
02:04:55,571 --> 02:04:57,072
What's in the briefcase?

2702
02:04:57,072 --> 02:04:59,074
Oh. I'm on my way
to the airport.

2703
02:04:59,074 --> 02:05:01,076
It's a paperhanger

2704
02:05:01,076 --> 02:05:03,579
who's working his way
through Minnesota.

2705
02:05:03,579 --> 02:05:05,080
(chuckling)

2706
02:05:05,080 --> 02:05:08,584
Aw, geez, he's...
he's driving us crazy.

2707
02:05:08,584 --> 02:05:10,085
You got any of the checks?

2708
02:05:10,085 --> 02:05:12,588
Yeah, yeah, I got a...
a counterfeit that he drew

2709
02:05:12,588 --> 02:05:14,590
on the Great Lakes
Savings and Loan.

2710
02:05:14,590 --> 02:05:16,592
See, he's just using
a stencil machine

2711
02:05:16,592 --> 02:05:18,093
and an Underwood.

2712
02:05:18,093 --> 02:05:20,596
Yeah, it's a teller
at the bank.

2713
02:05:20,596 --> 02:05:22,097
Say again?

2714
02:05:22,097 --> 02:05:23,599
I-It's definitely
a teller, Carl.

2715
02:05:23,599 --> 02:05:25,601
I mean, banks, they
always use hand-stamps

2716
02:05:25,601 --> 02:05:27,102
for the dates, see.

2717
02:05:27,102 --> 02:05:29,104
They get used
over and over again

2718
02:05:29,104 --> 02:05:30,606
so they always get worn out

2719
02:05:30,606 --> 02:05:32,107
and the numbers
are always cracking.

2720
02:05:32,608 --> 02:05:34,109
The sixes and the nines...

2721
02:05:34,109 --> 02:05:36,111
see, they go first.

2722
02:05:38,113 --> 02:05:40,115
Thanks.

2723
02:05:40,115 --> 02:05:42,117
(buzzer sounding)

2724
02:05:44,620 --> 02:05:47,623
MAN:
I'd like you to take a look
at something for me.

2725
02:05:52,628 --> 02:05:54,630
Tell me
what you think.

2726
02:05:54,630 --> 02:05:57,132
(clears throat)

2727
02:05:57,132 --> 02:05:58,634
That's a fake.

2728
02:05:58,634 --> 02:06:00,636
How do you know?

2729
02:06:00,636 --> 02:06:01,637
You haven't
looked at it.

2730
02:06:01,637 --> 02:06:04,139
Well, there's
no perforated edge, right?

2731
02:06:04,139 --> 02:06:07,142
I mean, this... this check
was hand-cut, not fed.

2732
02:06:07,142 --> 02:06:09,645
Yeah...

2733
02:06:09,645 --> 02:06:10,646
Paper is double-bonded

2734
02:06:10,646 --> 02:06:13,148
much too heavy
to be a bank check.

2735
02:06:13,148 --> 02:06:17,152
Magnetic ink, it's, uh,
raised against my fingers

2736
02:06:17,152 --> 02:06:18,654
instead of flat.

2737
02:06:18,654 --> 02:06:19,655
(sniffing)

2738
02:06:19,655 --> 02:06:21,156
And this doesn't
smell like MICR.

2739
02:06:21,156 --> 02:06:22,157
It's some kind of a...

2740
02:06:22,157 --> 02:06:24,159
you know, some kind
of a drafting ink.

2741
02:06:24,159 --> 02:06:26,161
You know, the kind you get
at a stationery store.

2742
02:06:26,161 --> 02:06:27,663
(clears throat)

2743
02:06:30,165 --> 02:06:32,167
(paper rustling)

2744
02:06:32,167 --> 02:06:34,169
Frank...

2745
02:06:34,169 --> 02:06:36,171
would you be interested
in working

2746
02:06:36,171 --> 02:06:38,173
with the FBI's
Financial Crimes Unit?

2747
02:06:38,173 --> 02:06:40,175
(shuffles cards)

2748
02:06:40,175 --> 02:06:41,176
I already got a job here.

2749
02:06:41,176 --> 02:06:42,678
You know, I, uh,
deliver the mail.

2750
02:06:44,680 --> 02:06:49,685
Frank, we have the power
to take you out of prison.

2751
02:06:49,685 --> 02:06:51,186
You'd be placed in
the custody of the FBI

2752
02:06:51,186 --> 02:06:53,689
where you'd serve out the
remainder of your sentence

2753
02:06:53,689 --> 02:06:55,190
as an employee of
the federal government.

2754
02:06:57,693 --> 02:07:00,195
Under whose custody?

2755
02:07:06,201 --> 02:07:08,704
(phone ringing)

2756
02:07:08,704 --> 02:07:11,206
Hi. I-I'm Frank Abagnale.

2757
02:07:11,206 --> 02:07:13,709
I'm supposed to start work
here today.

2758
02:07:13,709 --> 02:07:16,712
It's a tour company
operating out of the BVI.

2759
02:07:16,712 --> 02:07:18,714
Sir, Mr. Abagnale
is here.

2760
02:07:18,714 --> 02:07:20,215
I'm going
to call you back.

2761
02:07:30,225 --> 02:07:33,228
(melancholy melody playing)

2762
02:07:41,737 --> 02:07:45,741
? ?

2763
02:07:50,245 --> 02:07:52,247
Hello, Carl.

2764
02:07:52,247 --> 02:07:54,249
Welcome to the FBI.

2765
02:07:54,249 --> 02:07:56,251
I'll show you
where you're working.

2766
02:08:03,759 --> 02:08:06,762
Carl... how long
do I have to work here?

2767
02:08:07,262 --> 02:08:09,765
It's 8:15 in the morning
to 5:00 in the afternoon.

2768
02:08:09,765 --> 02:08:11,767
45 minutes for lunch.

2769
02:08:11,767 --> 02:08:13,769
No, I...

2770
02:08:13,769 --> 02:08:15,771
I mean, how long?

2771
02:08:17,773 --> 02:08:19,775
Every day.

2772
02:08:19,775 --> 02:08:22,277
Every day, Frank,
till we let you go.

2773
02:08:32,287 --> 02:08:37,292
? ?

2774
02:08:46,301 --> 02:08:50,305
? ?

2775
02:09:00,315 --> 02:09:04,820
? ?

2776
02:09:13,829 --> 02:09:16,331
(tapping)
Yeah.

2777
02:09:16,331 --> 02:09:19,334
Hey, Carl.
Hi.

2778
02:09:19,334 --> 02:09:21,837
How you doing?

2779
02:09:21,837 --> 02:09:22,838
It's not a good
time, Frank.

2780
02:09:22,838 --> 02:09:24,840
I'm clearing my desk
for the weekend.

2781
02:09:27,843 --> 02:09:30,846
Carl, you mind if I come
to work with you tomorrow?

2782
02:09:30,846 --> 02:09:32,848
Tomorrow is Saturday.

2783
02:09:32,848 --> 02:09:35,350
I'm flying to Chicago
to see my daughter.

2784
02:09:35,350 --> 02:09:36,852
I'll be back
to work on Monday.

2785
02:09:36,852 --> 02:09:37,853
You're going
to see Grace, huh?

2786
02:09:37,853 --> 02:09:39,354
Well, that's the plan.

2787
02:09:41,857 --> 02:09:43,358
(heavy sigh)

2788
02:09:43,358 --> 02:09:45,360
So what should
I do till Monday?

2789
02:09:45,360 --> 02:09:47,362
I'm sorry, kid, I
can't help you there.

2790
02:09:47,362 --> 02:09:48,363
Excuse me.

2791
02:09:51,366 --> 02:09:54,870
(phone rings)

2792
02:09:54,870 --> 02:09:57,372
This is Hanratty.

2793
02:09:57,372 --> 02:09:59,374
Oh, yeah, put him on.

2794
02:10:07,382 --> 02:10:09,384
Mr. Sawyer.

2795
02:10:09,384 --> 02:10:11,386
How are you?

2796
02:10:11,386 --> 02:10:13,388
I have a half a dozen
more checks

2797
02:10:13,388 --> 02:10:15,390
on that tour operator
at the BVI.

2798
02:10:22,815 --> 02:10:24,817
(laughs quietly)

2799
02:10:34,827 --> 02:10:38,330
? ?

2800
02:10:38,330 --> 02:10:40,332
(opens and shuts drawer)

2801
02:10:48,841 --> 02:10:51,343
WOMAN (over P.A.):
American Airlines 355

2802
02:10:51,343 --> 02:10:53,846
serving Chicago
and San Francisco

2803
02:10:53,846 --> 02:10:55,347
is now open
for passenger check-in.

2804
02:10:55,848 --> 02:10:58,851
How'd you do it, Frank?

2805
02:10:58,851 --> 02:11:02,354
How'd you pass the bar
in Louisiana?

2806
02:11:02,354 --> 02:11:04,857
What are you doing here?

2807
02:11:04,857 --> 02:11:06,859
Listen...

2808
02:11:06,859 --> 02:11:08,861
I'm sorry I put you
through all this.

2809
02:11:08,861 --> 02:11:11,864
You go back to Europe, you're
gonna die in Perpignan Prison.

2810
02:11:11,864 --> 02:11:13,365
You try to run
here in the States

2811
02:11:13,365 --> 02:11:15,868
we'll send you
back to Atlanta for 50 years.

2812
02:11:15,868 --> 02:11:18,871
I know that.

2813
02:11:18,871 --> 02:11:21,373
I spent four years trying
to arrange your release.

2814
02:11:21,874 --> 02:11:23,375
Had to convince my bosses
at the FBI

2815
02:11:23,375 --> 02:11:25,878
and the Attorney General
of the United States

2816
02:11:25,878 --> 02:11:26,879
you wouldn't run.

2817
02:11:26,879 --> 02:11:29,882
Why'd you do it?

2818
02:11:29,882 --> 02:11:30,883
You're just a kid.

2819
02:11:30,883 --> 02:11:32,885
I'm not your kid.

2820
02:11:32,885 --> 02:11:35,387
You said you were
going to Chicago.

2821
02:11:35,387 --> 02:11:37,389
My daughter can't see me
this weekend.

2822
02:11:37,389 --> 02:11:39,391
She's going skiing.

2823
02:11:39,391 --> 02:11:40,893
You said she was
four years old.

2824
02:11:40,893 --> 02:11:41,894
You're lying.

2825
02:11:42,394 --> 02:11:43,896
She was four
when I left.

2826
02:11:43,896 --> 02:11:45,397
Now she's 15.

2827
02:11:45,397 --> 02:11:48,400
My wife's been remarried
for 11 years.

2828
02:11:48,400 --> 02:11:50,903
I see Grace
every now and again.

2829
02:11:50,903 --> 02:11:52,905
I don't understand.

2830
02:11:52,905 --> 02:11:54,907
Sure you do.

2831
02:11:54,907 --> 02:11:57,409
Sometimes it's easier
living the lie.

2832
02:12:00,913 --> 02:12:03,916
I'm going to let you
fly tonight, Frank.

2833
02:12:03,916 --> 02:12:05,918
I'm not even going
to try to stop you.

2834
02:12:05,918 --> 02:12:07,920
That's 'cause I know
you'll be back on Monday.

2835
02:12:07,920 --> 02:12:11,423
Yeah? How do you know
I'll come back?

2836
02:12:11,423 --> 02:12:14,426
(chuckles quietly)

2837
02:12:14,426 --> 02:12:16,428
Look.

2838
02:12:16,428 --> 02:12:18,430
Frank...

2839
02:12:18,430 --> 02:12:20,933
nobody's chasing you.

2840
02:12:20,933 --> 02:12:24,937
WOMAN (over P.A.):
American Airlines flight 131
to Pittsburgh

2841
02:12:25,437 --> 02:12:26,939
is now ready for boarding.

2842
02:12:27,439 --> 02:12:31,944
Passengers with boarding passes,
please proceed to Gate 23A.

2843
02:12:38,951 --> 02:12:40,953
Okay.

2844
02:12:40,953 --> 02:12:42,955
Alice, has he still
not called?

2845
02:12:42,955 --> 02:12:44,957
No, he hasn't.

2846
02:12:54,967 --> 02:12:57,970
HANRATTY:
Good morning.

2847
02:12:57,970 --> 02:12:59,972
I've, uh, called this
meeting to discuss

2848
02:12:59,972 --> 02:13:02,474
a new type of check fraud
and counterfeiting

2849
02:13:02,474 --> 02:13:04,476
which the unsub is washing
and altering checks

2850
02:13:04,977 --> 02:13:06,478
then passing them
throughout Arizona.

2851
02:13:06,979 --> 02:13:10,983
(panting)

2852
02:13:10,983 --> 02:13:12,484
This unsub is a big dog

2853
02:13:12,484 --> 02:13:14,486
passing checks
as large as five figures.

2854
02:13:14,486 --> 02:13:16,488
(door opening)

2855
02:13:17,990 --> 02:13:20,993
Sorry I'm late.

2856
02:13:20,993 --> 02:13:22,995
Sorry.

2857
02:13:26,498 --> 02:13:30,002
We have a recovered check
on Agent Reiter's desk.

2858
02:13:30,002 --> 02:13:32,004
Why don't we step out
to the bullpen?

2859
02:13:36,508 --> 02:13:40,512
There's impressions
on every line.

2860
02:13:40,512 --> 02:13:44,016
Looks like the original amount
was for $60.

2861
02:13:48,020 --> 02:13:49,021
Mind if I take a look?

2862
02:13:52,524 --> 02:13:55,527
Cashed in Flagstaff
a week ago.

2863
02:13:57,529 --> 02:14:00,532
Cost the bank $16,000.

2864
02:14:00,532 --> 02:14:02,534
It's a real check.

2865
02:14:02,534 --> 02:14:04,536
Yeah.

2866
02:14:04,536 --> 02:14:05,537
Yeah. It's been washed.

2867
02:14:05,537 --> 02:14:07,539
The only thing original
is the signature.

2868
02:14:07,539 --> 02:14:09,541
But it's perfect, Carl.
I mean...

2869
02:14:09,541 --> 02:14:12,044
I mean, this isn't
hydrochloride or bleach.

2870
02:14:12,044 --> 02:14:14,046
No.

2871
02:14:14,546 --> 02:14:16,048
Something new.

2872
02:14:16,048 --> 02:14:18,050
Maybe a nail polish remover
where the acetone

2873
02:14:18,050 --> 02:14:20,052
removes the ink that's
not been printed?

2874
02:14:24,056 --> 02:14:27,059
How did you do it, Frank?

2875
02:14:27,059 --> 02:14:30,062
How did you cheat on the
bar exam in Louisiana?

2876
02:14:35,567 --> 02:14:38,570
I didn't cheat.

2877
02:14:38,570 --> 02:14:42,574
I studied for two weeks
and I passed.

2878
02:14:43,575 --> 02:14:46,078
Is that the truth, Frank?

2879
02:14:46,078 --> 02:14:48,080
Is that the truth?

2880
02:14:48,080 --> 02:14:50,582
I'll bet this guy steals checks
out of mailboxes.

2881
02:14:50,582 --> 02:14:53,085
He washes off their names
and he puts on his own.

2882
02:14:55,087 --> 02:14:57,589
You're saying
that he's a local?

2883
02:14:57,589 --> 02:14:58,590
Well, if it were me,
you know

2884
02:14:58,590 --> 02:15:01,093
I'd call the bank first,
I'd check out the balance...

2885
02:15:01,093 --> 02:15:02,594
Make sure there's
enough money in there

2886
02:15:02,594 --> 02:15:04,096
to make it
worth your while.

2887
02:15:04,096 --> 02:15:05,097
Exactly.

2888
02:15:05,097 --> 02:15:07,099
You know, Carl, I think
this guy's pretty smart.

2889
02:15:07,099 --> 02:15:08,600
(laughs)

2890
02:15:08,600 --> 02:15:11,103
I guess all we have to do now
is catch him.

2891
02:15:12,604 --> 02:15:15,107
We'll start first
thing in the morning.

2892
02:15:15,107 --> 02:15:17,609
We'll run the name
Eric Anthony Feeders.

2893
02:15:17,609 --> 02:15:19,611
In Nevada, Arizona,
California.

2894
02:15:19,611 --> 02:15:22,114
Both names, right?
Chris Frank, too?

2895
02:15:22,114 --> 02:15:24,116
Yeah...

2896
02:15:24,116 --> 02:15:27,119
(discussion continues
indistinctly)

2897
02:15:37,129 --> 02:15:40,132
(orchestra playing
whimsical jazzy theme)

2898
02:15:50,142 --> 02:15:53,145
? ?

2899
02:16:03,155 --> 02:16:06,241
? ?

2900
02:16:16,084 --> 02:16:20,088
? ?

2901
02:16:30,098 --> 02:16:33,101
? ?

2902
02:16:43,111 --> 02:16:46,114
? ?

2903
02:16:56,124 --> 02:16:59,127
? ?

2904
02:17:08,637 --> 02:17:12,140
? ?

2905
02:17:22,150 --> 02:17:25,654
? ?

2906
02:17:35,163 --> 02:17:39,167
? ?

2907
02:17:49,177 --> 02:17:52,180
? ?

2908
02:18:01,690 --> 02:18:05,193
? ?

2909
02:18:15,203 --> 02:18:18,707
? ?

2910
02:18:28,216 --> 02:18:31,219
? ?

2911
02:18:41,229 --> 02:18:44,232
? ?

2912
02:18:54,242 --> 02:18:57,245
? ?

2913
02:19:06,755 --> 02:19:10,258
? ?

2914
02:19:20,268 --> 02:19:23,471
? ?

2915
02:19:33,031 --> 02:19:37,535
? ?

2916
02:19:47,045 --> 02:19:50,048
? ?

2917
02:20:00,558 --> 02:20:03,561
? ?

2918
02:20:13,571 --> 02:20:16,691
? ?

2919
02:20:26,534 --> 02:20:29,587
? ?

2920
02:20:37,679 --> 02:20:40,915
(music ends)
