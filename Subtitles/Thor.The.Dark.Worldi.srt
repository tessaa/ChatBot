<i>on a 5,000-year cycle</i>

662
00:52:01,486 --> 00:52:04,620
and once a cycle,
all the worlds align.

663
00:52:04,622 --> 00:52:07,189
Imagine... Imagine that
this is our world.

664
00:52:08,158 --> 00:52:10,459
Oh, thank you.
And this is another world.

665
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:12,561
Normally, they're separate.

666
00:52:12,563 --> 00:52:14,263
But during the Alignment,

667
00:52:14,265 --> 00:52:18,134
everything is connected,
all nine realms.

668
00:52:18,136 --> 00:52:20,569
All nine realms
are passing through each other

669
00:52:20,571 --> 00:52:23,139
and gravity, light,
and even matter,

670
00:52:23,141 --> 00:52:25,074
is crashing from one world
to the other.

671
00:52:27,777 --> 00:52:29,445
But if this happens to us now,

672
00:52:29,447 --> 00:52:31,947
the result will be cataclysmic.

673
00:52:31,949 --> 00:52:34,517
My gravimetric spikes
can stabilize

674
00:52:34,519 --> 00:52:36,085
the focal point
of the Convergence.

675
00:52:36,853 --> 00:52:39,522
This time, the Alignment

676
00:52:39,524 --> 00:52:42,424
and all the other worlds
would just pass us by.

677
00:52:42,426 --> 00:52:43,859
It's beautiful.

678
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:47,396
It's simple. Any questions?

679
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:51,534
Yeah.

680
00:52:52,369 --> 00:52:54,837
Can I have my shoe back?

681
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:04,847

TYR: Jane Foster?

684
00:53:49,259 --> 00:53:51,327
You need to come with us.

685
00:53:53,029 --> 00:53:56,165
We are still unable to restore
the palace shields.

686
00:53:56,167 --> 00:53:57,600
Our artillery
cannot detect them.

687
00:53:57,602 --> 00:53:59,168
Even Heimdall cannot see them.

688
00:54:02,872 --> 00:54:06,442
My king,
we are all but defenseless.

689
00:54:09,112 --> 00:54:10,446
She's your prisoner now?

690
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:14,183
Leave us.

691
00:54:23,393 --> 00:54:25,327
I do not wish
to fight with you.

692
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:28,097
Nor I with you.

693
00:54:28,099 --> 00:54:29,932
But I intend
to pursue Malekith.

694
00:54:29,934 --> 00:54:31,055
ODIN: We possess the Aether.

695
00:54:31,868 --> 00:54:33,269
Malekith will come to us.

696
00:54:33,271 --> 00:54:35,437
Yes, and he will destroy us.

697
00:54:35,439 --> 00:54:37,706
You overestimate
the power of these creatures.

698
00:54:37,708 --> 00:54:40,142
No, I value our people's lives.

699
00:54:40,144 --> 00:54:41,977
I'll take Jane
to the Dark World,

700
00:54:41,979 --> 00:54:43,379
and draw the enemy
away from Asgard.

701
00:54:44,214 --> 00:54:46,582
When Malekith
pulls the Aether from Jane,

702
00:54:46,584 --> 00:54:48,651
it will be exposed
and vulnerable.

703
00:54:48,653 --> 00:54:50,219
And I will destroy it and him.

704
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:55,391
If you fail,
you risk this weapon

705
00:54:55,393 --> 00:54:57,293
falling into the hands
of our enemies.

706
00:54:57,295 --> 00:54:59,995
The risk is far greater
if we do nothing.

707
00:54:59,997 --> 00:55:01,930
His ship could be over
our heads right now,

708
00:55:01,932 --> 00:55:03,132
we would never even know it.

709
00:55:03,134 --> 00:55:05,000
If and when he comes

710
00:55:05,002 --> 00:55:08,937
his men will fall
on 10,000 Asgardian blades.

711
00:55:08,939 --> 00:55:10,172
And how many of our men
shall fall on theirs?

712
00:55:10,174 --> 00:55:12,141
As many as are needed!

713
00:55:15,278 --> 00:55:16,412
Ah!

714
00:55:21,084 --> 00:55:22,518
We will fight!

715
00:55:25,355 --> 00:55:27,589
Till the last Asgardian breath.

716
00:55:28,692 --> 00:55:31,427
Till the last drop
of Asgardian blood.

717
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:36,999
Then how are you different
from Malekith?

718
00:55:37,001 --> 00:55:38,267
(CHUCKLES)

719
00:55:40,303 --> 00:55:42,538
The difference, my son,
is that I will win.

720
00:55:56,986 --> 00:56:00,155
Jane isn't calling me back,
Erik isn't calling me back,

721
00:56:00,157 --> 00:56:02,124
stupid S.H.I.E.L.D.
isn't calling me back.

722
00:56:02,126 --> 00:56:03,992
What's S.H.I.E.L.D?
It's a secret.

723
00:56:03,994 --> 00:56:06,128
Hey, Erik, it's Darcy again.

724
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:09,164
Thor came back,
he took Jane to Asgard,

725
00:56:09,166 --> 00:56:12,801
and I'm not sure
what I'm supposed to do.

726
00:56:12,803 --> 00:56:14,570
NEWSCASTER:<i>Something else</i>

727
00:56:14,572 --> 00:56:17,906
<i>when astrophysicist</i>
<i>Dr. Erik Selvig</i>

728
00:56:17,908 --> 00:56:19,341
<i>notable for his involvement</i>

IAN: Darcy, you really
need to look at this.

732
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:27,182
Your friend, Erik...

733
00:56:27,184 --> 00:56:28,617
What was his last name again?

734
00:56:29,753 --> 00:56:33,389
<i>And began shouting at visitors</i>
<i>to the historic site.</i>

735
00:56:33,391 --> 00:56:35,124
<i>He was later taken</i>
<i>into police custody</i>

<i>Police are still refusing</i>

738
00:56:51,007 --> 00:56:53,442
You were not
at Odin's war council.

739
00:56:53,444 --> 00:56:55,611
The Bifrost is closed
by your father's orders.

740
00:56:55,613 --> 00:56:56,945
No one is to come

741
00:56:56,947 --> 00:56:58,180
or to go.

742
00:57:00,617 --> 00:57:03,352
We face an enemy that is
invisible even to me.

743
00:57:03,354 --> 00:57:06,688
What use is a guardian
such as that?

744
00:57:08,458 --> 00:57:11,093
Malekith will return,
you know this.

745
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:15,531
I need your help.

746
00:57:15,533 --> 00:57:19,067
I cannot overrule my king's
wishes. Not even for you.

747
00:57:19,069 --> 00:57:21,103
I'm not asking you to.

748
00:57:21,105 --> 00:57:23,305
The realms need their Allfather
strong and unchallenged

749
00:57:23,307 --> 00:57:26,141
whether he is or not.

750
00:57:26,143 --> 00:57:28,243
But he is blinded, Heimdall

751
00:57:28,245 --> 00:57:29,645
by hatred and by grief.

752
00:57:29,647 --> 00:57:31,313
As are we all.

753
00:57:31,315 --> 00:57:33,048
I see clearly enough.

754
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:34,783
The risks are too great.

755
00:57:34,785 --> 00:57:37,619
Everything we do
from here on is a risk.

756
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:39,188
There is no other way.

757
00:57:43,226 --> 00:57:45,828
What do you require of me?

758
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:47,429
THOR:
<i>What I'm about to ask of you</i>

759
00:57:47,431 --> 00:57:49,431
<i>is treason</i>
<i>of the highest order.</i>

760
00:57:49,433 --> 00:57:51,767
<i>Success will bring us exile</i>

761
00:57:51,769 --> 00:57:53,335
<i>and failure</i>
<i>shall mean our death.</i>

762
00:57:56,506 --> 00:57:58,941
<i>Malekith knew</i>
<i>the Aether was here.</i>

763
00:57:58,943 --> 00:58:01,176
<i>He can sense its power.</i>

764
00:58:01,178 --> 00:58:03,579
<i>If we do nothing,</i>
<i>he will come for it again</i>

765
00:58:03,581 --> 00:58:07,349
<i>but this time,</i>
<i>lay waste to all of Asgard.</i>

766
00:58:08,418 --> 00:58:10,619
We must move Jane off-world.

767
00:58:10,621 --> 00:58:12,588
The Bifrost has been shut down

768
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:14,456
and the Tesseract
locked away in the vault.

769
00:58:14,458 --> 00:58:16,492
There are other paths
off Asgard.

770
00:58:16,494 --> 00:58:18,293
Ways known only to a few.

771
00:58:18,295 --> 00:58:20,262
One, actually.

772
00:58:22,365 --> 00:58:23,432
No.

773
00:58:28,538 --> 00:58:32,140
Thor. After all this time

774
00:58:32,142 --> 00:58:34,443
and now you come to visit me.

775
00:58:35,812 --> 00:58:36,879
Why?

776
00:58:38,448 --> 00:58:41,650
Have you come to gloat?
To mock?

777
00:58:41,652 --> 00:58:43,185
Loki, enough.

778
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:45,387
No more illusions.

779
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:54,596
Now you see me, brother.

780
00:59:03,406 --> 00:59:05,541
Did she suffer?

781
00:59:05,543 --> 00:59:08,010
I did not come here
to share our grief.

782
00:59:08,012 --> 00:59:10,646
Instead I offer you the chance
of a far richer sacrament.

783
00:59:12,148 --> 00:59:13,749
Go on.

784
00:59:13,751 --> 00:59:16,685
I know you seek
vengeance as much as I do.

785
00:59:16,687 --> 00:59:19,655
You help me escape Asgard
and I will grant it to you.

786
00:59:19,657 --> 00:59:21,256
Vengeance

787
00:59:21,258 --> 00:59:23,492
and afterward, this cell.

788
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:29,665
(CHUCKLES)

789
00:59:30,366 --> 00:59:33,068
You must be truly desperate

790
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:34,903
to come to me for help.

791
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:38,507
What makes you think
you can trust me?

792
00:59:38,509 --> 00:59:39,675
I don't.

793
00:59:41,711 --> 00:59:42,644
Mother did.

794
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,760
But you should know that when we
fought each other in the past,

795
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:49,117
I did so with a glimmer of hope

796
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:50,879
that my brother was still
in there somewhere.

797
00:59:52,689 --> 00:59:54,656
That hope no longer exists
to protect you.

798
00:59:55,792 --> 00:59:58,860
You betray me,
and I will kill you.

799
01:00:01,631 --> 01:00:02,831
Hmm.

800
01:00:04,467 --> 01:00:06,401
When do we start?

801
01:00:06,403 --> 01:00:07,970
He will betray you.

802
01:00:07,972 --> 01:00:09,371
He will try.

803
01:00:14,143 --> 01:00:16,478
This is so unlike you, brother.

804
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:19,214
So clandestine.

805
01:00:19,216 --> 01:00:21,457
Are you sure you wouldn't
rather just punch your way out?

806
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:23,986
If you keep speaking,
I just might.

807
01:00:23,988 --> 01:00:25,988
Fine. As you wish.

808
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:26,822
I'm not even here.

809
01:00:28,257 --> 01:00:30,158
Is this better?

810
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:32,828
It's better company at least.

811
01:00:32,830 --> 01:00:36,398
Still, we could be
less conspicuous.

812
01:00:38,434 --> 01:00:40,402
Mmm, brother,
you look ravishing.

813
01:00:42,772 --> 01:00:45,607
It will hurt no less
when I kill you in this form.

814
01:00:45,609 --> 01:00:48,677
Very well. Perhaps you prefer
one of your new companions

815
01:00:48,679 --> 01:00:50,512
given that you seem
to like them so much.

816
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:53,081
Oh, this is much better.

817
01:00:53,083 --> 01:00:54,683
Ooh.

818
01:00:54,685 --> 01:00:57,352
The costume is a bit much.
So tight.

819
01:00:57,354 --> 01:00:58,954
But the confidence...

820
01:00:58,956 --> 01:01:02,024
I can feel
the righteousness surging.

821
01:01:02,026 --> 01:01:04,307

last time he was gone for,
like, two years.

Well, it's only been
two days, so...

Did he say anything
before he left?

Yeah, he had to figure some
stuff out with his father.

Father, I cannot
be king of Asgard.

I will protect Asgard

from that chair.

Loki, for all his grave imbalance,
understood rule as I know I never will.

than a great king.

Is this my son I hear,
or the woman he loves?

When you speak, do I
never hear Mother's voice?

She does not know
what I came here to say.

Now, forbid me to see her, or
say she can rule at my side.

Is this my legacy?

01:40:30,725 --> 01:40:32,091
Loki died with honor.

1372
01:40:33,394 --> 01:40:34,660
I shall try to live the same.

1373
01:40:34,662 --> 01:40:35,962
Is that not legacy enough?

1374
01:40:47,241 --> 01:40:49,275
It belongs to you.

1376
01:40:52,347 --> 01:40:54,313
I shall try to be.

01:40:55,983 --> 01:40:58,885
I cannot give you my blessing,

good fortune.

If I were proud of
the man my son had become,

1381
01:41:09,931 --> 01:41:12,131
even that, I could not say.

only from my heart.
