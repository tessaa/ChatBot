1
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:00,761
A case in point in anger's
ability to change us

2
00:01:00,802 --> 00:01:02,770
is my mother.

3
00:01:02,804 --> 00:01:05,204
My mother was always
the nicest person I ever knew.

4
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:10,441
She was the nicest, sweetest woman
than anyone who knew her ever knew.

5
00:01:13,481 --> 00:01:15,745
Then things changed...

6
00:01:15,783 --> 00:01:17,614
then she changed.

7
00:01:17,652 --> 00:01:20,985
She got angry.
Good and angry.

8
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:35,496
Anger has turned my mother
into a very sad and bitter woman.

9
00:01:38,206 --> 00:01:40,265
If she wasn't my mother,
I'd slap her.

10
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:42,435
I would.

11
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:46,106
I'd look her straight in the face and
tell her what I really think of her...

12
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:50,015
and then I'd run really fast
in the opposite direction.

13
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,518
- Are you eating?
- Yes.

14
00:02:31,559 --> 00:02:33,959
I want you eating.
I mean it.

15
00:02:39,267 --> 00:02:40,757
Okay.

16
00:02:40,802 --> 00:02:42,895
You ladies
are old enough now,

17
00:02:42,937 --> 00:02:44,905
I'm not gonna pull
any punches here.

18
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:46,907
He took his wallet...

19
00:02:46,941 --> 00:02:48,909
and he left.

20
00:02:48,943 --> 00:02:50,911
When he didn't come home
the other night,

21
00:02:50,945 --> 00:02:52,913
you know,
I thought we got lucky

22
00:02:52,947 --> 00:02:54,915
and he was just
in a car crash,

23
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:57,213
dead by the side of the road,
but the fact is,

24
00:02:57,251 --> 00:03:00,880
he's run off with his little Swedish
secretary, who, oh, what a coincidence,

25
00:03:00,922 --> 00:03:03,914
mysteriously left work three days ago
and moved back to Sweden!

26
00:03:08,362 --> 00:03:10,557
But where did he go?
Have you spoken to him?

27
00:03:10,598 --> 00:03:12,566
No, I haven't
spoken to him.

28
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,795
There is
very little to say.

29
00:03:14,836 --> 00:03:17,805
He knows that. But I did cut off
all his goddamn credit cards.

30
00:03:17,839 --> 00:03:20,239
Closed his checking
account, yeah.

31
00:03:20,274 --> 00:03:22,265
See how long she sticks
around when he's broke.

32
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:25,074
Your father is a...

33
00:03:25,113 --> 00:03:27,104
small man.

34
00:03:28,116 --> 00:03:29,947
Very small.

35
00:03:29,984 --> 00:03:33,112
I hope that's not an allusion
to the man's genitals

36
00:03:33,154 --> 00:03:35,588
- 'cause that'd just be gross.
- Aw, dude,

37
00:03:35,623 --> 00:03:37,784
- I was about to eat a string bean.
- Oh, my god...

38
00:03:37,825 --> 00:03:40,385
Excuse me, excuse me.
Everything is not a joke.

39
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,419
I am talking.

40
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:56,107
And as
a jittery nation worries

41
00:03:56,144 --> 00:04:00,012
about a counterstrike, we'll go to the
scene of the anthrax scare in Florida.

42
00:04:09,857 --> 00:04:11,848
Sheesh.

43
00:04:22,336 --> 00:04:24,304
Hey. Hey, Terry.

44
00:04:24,338 --> 00:04:26,306
What do you want?

45
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,308
Well, I-I...

46
00:04:28,342 --> 00:04:30,310
I wanted to talk
to you and Grey

47
00:04:30,344 --> 00:04:32,710
about them building that
subdivision back there?

48
00:04:32,747 --> 00:04:34,715
- Yeah?
- He's so, um...

49
00:04:34,749 --> 00:04:36,717
He's so damned set
against it,

50
00:04:36,751 --> 00:04:38,719
he hasn't even heard
the proposal.

51
00:04:38,753 --> 00:04:40,721
Grey doesn't
live here anymore, Denny.

52
00:04:40,755 --> 00:04:42,723
He doesn't exist.

53
00:04:42,757 --> 00:04:44,748
Go away.

54
00:04:50,031 --> 00:04:52,591
Officials tell us
that they are worried

55
00:04:52,633 --> 00:04:55,830
about how to manage the fragile US-led
coalition in the days ahead,

56
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,600
but the facts
are already evident

57
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,834
from south Asia, to Africa,
to the Middle East.

58
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:03,901
Worldwide, thousands
of angry demonstrators

59
00:05:03,945 --> 00:05:06,812
are taking to the streets
to protest US military...

60
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:09,976
The least he could have done
was taken this stupid jock with him.

61
00:05:10,017 --> 00:05:13,077
There have been plenty
of protests in the world.

62
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,781
and I suspect...

63
00:05:15,823 --> 00:05:17,791
Ugh.

64
00:05:17,825 --> 00:05:19,793
What... what...

65
00:05:19,827 --> 00:05:22,387
what do you mean,
"He doesn't exist"?

66
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,921
Oh.

67
00:05:26,234 --> 00:05:28,202
Are you stoned?

68
00:05:28,236 --> 00:05:31,399
- Yeah.
- Oh... Jesus.

69
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:33,407
What do you...
what do you mean,

70
00:05:33,441 --> 00:05:35,068
"He... he doesn't exist"?

71
00:05:35,109 --> 00:05:37,236
He's been messing around
with his assistant.

72
00:05:37,278 --> 00:05:39,246
Go talk about it
on the radio.

73
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,578
No, I'm... I'm...
no, I'm-I'm... I'm-I'm be...

74
00:05:41,616 --> 00:05:43,948
I'm being serious.
I need... I need to talk to him.

75
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:47,387
Um...

76
00:05:47,421 --> 00:05:49,412
He left me.

77
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:53,316
- He left you?
- Mm. For Danken Shane

78
00:05:53,361 --> 00:05:55,329
or whatever his
secretary's name is,

79
00:05:55,363 --> 00:05:58,025
so Denny you can go ahead
and build your...

80
00:05:58,065 --> 00:06:00,033
damn subdivision
back there...

81
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:02,035
I don't know,
whatever it is you want.

82
00:06:02,069 --> 00:06:04,503
It was him who had
the problem with it, not me, okay?

83
00:06:06,073 --> 00:06:08,041
- He left you?
- Yes.

84
00:06:08,075 --> 00:06:10,066
- Really?
- Yeah.

85
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,906
Hey, I'm sorry,
Terry.

86
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:21,551
You know, go ahead and build
your houses back there, Denny.

87
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:24,057
- He's gone. He won't stop...
- They're not my houses.

88
00:06:24,091 --> 00:06:26,059
They're not.
I'm just, um...

89
00:06:26,093 --> 00:06:28,391
I'm just the front man,
you know,

90
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,124
wave the
World Series ring.

91
00:06:30,164 --> 00:06:33,622
They get the sales,
I'm getting a free lot out of it.

92
00:06:33,668 --> 00:06:35,636
Ooh, a free lot.

93
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,661
- Hmm.
- It's something Shep set up.

94
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:45,803
He really left?
Really?

95
00:06:45,846 --> 00:06:47,814
This is... true?

96
00:06:47,848 --> 00:06:49,839
Yeah.

97
00:06:51,986 --> 00:06:54,614
Hey, come on.
Just go away.

98
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:05,421
Hey. Well... ah... look,
let me come in.

99
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:08,499
Come on, if yo...
if you don't want,

100
00:07:08,536 --> 00:07:10,868
I won't talk. I'll just sit there
and I'll drink with you.

101
00:07:13,174 --> 00:07:15,540
There was a large mob...

102
00:07:15,576 --> 00:07:17,544
of angry demonstrators
here today,

103
00:07:17,578 --> 00:07:20,604
proving that a number
of people are willing to go and fight.

104
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:23,481
- The feeling is that...
- I got her to school.

105
00:07:23,517 --> 00:07:25,451
Thank you.

106
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:27,716
You know I'm going back
to school in the morning,

107
00:07:27,755 --> 00:07:29,848
you're gonna get her
yourself tomorrow.

108
00:07:46,907 --> 00:07:49,774
Billy Edwards on my bus says
that when you get really drunk,

109
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:53,041
you get friendly and you sign baseballs
without bitching about it.

110
00:07:55,216 --> 00:07:57,207
- He does?
- Yeah.

111
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:01,280
So, you got any
baseballs around?

112
00:08:01,322 --> 00:08:03,552
No.

113
00:08:05,059 --> 00:08:07,118
Why don't you run
down the street to my house.

114
00:08:07,161 --> 00:08:09,129
I got a...

115
00:08:09,163 --> 00:08:12,564
stack of boxes in my garage.
There's a key under my mat.

116
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,660
You grab one of those boxes.
You bring it back here.

117
00:08:17,204 --> 00:08:19,229
One box.

118
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,670
Anything she makes...

119
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:25,770
I'm gonna split with her.

120
00:08:35,222 --> 00:08:38,953
Buddy, Goddamn you!
Out!

121
00:08:38,993 --> 00:08:42,121
What's the big deal? He wasn't licking
it more than three seconds.

122
00:08:42,163 --> 00:08:45,599
The three second thing is for floors,
not dogs' mouths.

123
00:08:45,633 --> 00:08:48,329
He spends all day
licking other dogs' asses.

124
00:08:48,369 --> 00:08:50,337
Oh, let's just call
for take-out.

125
00:08:50,371 --> 00:08:53,101
It's fine. You guys, it's good chicken.
It's fine.

126
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,608
Like you'd eat it?

127
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,449
It's fine.

128
00:09:04,485 --> 00:09:06,749
You know the Zilwaukees'
Great Dane, "Mo'fo?"

129
00:09:06,787 --> 00:09:08,652
You're licking
his asshole right now.

130
00:09:11,058 --> 00:09:13,288
You know what,
that's really sick.

131
00:09:13,327 --> 00:09:15,591
How's dinner coming?

132
00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:18,257
Good.
We made your favorite.

133
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:20,164
- Chicken.
- Thank you.

134
00:09:20,201 --> 00:09:22,999
Um, can you make an extra plate?
Denny's staying for dinner.

135
00:09:23,037 --> 00:09:25,198
That was quick.

136
00:09:26,207 --> 00:09:28,175
What was quick?

137
00:09:28,209 --> 00:09:30,643
What was quick?

138
00:09:30,678 --> 00:09:32,669
Denny?!

139
00:09:34,048 --> 00:09:36,016
Please...

140
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:38,917
Give me more credit than that, Hadley.
He's a drunk.

141
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,921
You make a nice couple.

142
00:09:45,392 --> 00:09:47,360
My life is falling apart
at this moment.

143
00:09:47,394 --> 00:09:50,795
I expect some compassion
from you.

144
00:09:50,831 --> 00:09:52,799
Now you go back up
to school tomorrow,

145
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:55,233
come back home
at Christmas break

146
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:57,237
and bust my hump
if you want to,

147
00:09:57,271 --> 00:10:00,832
but right this minute, I want
the benefit of the doubt at every turn!

148
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,843
Are we clear?

149
00:10:02,877 --> 00:10:04,868
Yes.

150
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,371
Thank you.

151
00:10:13,954 --> 00:10:15,945
Mm, this looks good.

152
00:10:23,097 --> 00:10:25,895
What kind of a dick-head
runs away

153
00:10:25,933 --> 00:10:27,400
with his secretary?

154
00:10:27,434 --> 00:10:28,731
That is lame.
Take a right,

155
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:30,828
make a left
at pathetic.

156
00:10:30,871 --> 00:10:33,362
I think he's coming
back home.

157
00:10:36,644 --> 00:10:39,704
Maybe not soon,
but... I do.

158
00:10:41,882 --> 00:10:43,850
I think we should
call him.

159
00:10:43,884 --> 00:10:45,852
And say what?

160
00:10:45,886 --> 00:10:48,286
"Hey Dad, how's your
new life going so far?

161
00:10:48,322 --> 00:10:50,483
I got an A
in interpretive dance."

162
00:10:51,825 --> 00:10:53,986
He doesn't care about you, Emily.
Get real.

163
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,832
He lost his job, Hadley.

164
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:01,767
- What?
- Your father was about to be laid off.

165
00:11:01,802 --> 00:11:03,793
He was told
a few months ago.

166
00:11:07,308 --> 00:11:09,799
He was devastated.
He didn't want you girls to know it.

167
00:11:11,312 --> 00:11:13,280
Okay? I think he
flipped out or something.

168
00:11:13,314 --> 00:11:15,282
I read this article

169
00:11:15,316 --> 00:11:17,341
on the internet.
Apparently, it's common.

170
00:11:17,384 --> 00:11:19,511
They lose their jobs,
and they go nuts.

171
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:21,282
What do you want
from me?

172
00:11:21,322 --> 00:11:22,949
It's the best
that I can come up with.

173
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,753
I don't want
anything from you.

174
00:11:24,792 --> 00:11:27,158
Well, don't take it out on me, Hadley.
You aren't gonna have to be here.

175
00:11:27,194 --> 00:11:28,923
You aren't gonna know
how empty this house is gonna be.

176
00:11:28,963 --> 00:11:31,397
Well, if it makes you feel
any better, I hate him too.

177
00:11:31,432 --> 00:11:33,400
Oh, does that mean
you hate me?

178
00:11:33,434 --> 00:11:35,402
You are such a mental.

179
00:11:35,436 --> 00:11:37,427
I have to go, okay?

180
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,631
All right.

181
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,235
I'll see you later,
okay?

182
00:12:10,371 --> 00:12:12,339
Terry.

183
00:12:12,373 --> 00:12:13,965
Hey.

184
00:12:14,008 --> 00:12:15,976
Listen to my show
today, okay?

185
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:19,002
I'll mention you.

186
00:12:19,046 --> 00:12:21,014
I'm gonna bring you up
as a drinking buddy

187
00:12:21,048 --> 00:12:24,506
- I watched the invasion with.
- I don't want you to do that, Denny.

188
00:12:24,551 --> 00:12:26,781
I know, but...
you don't have a choice.

189
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,220
Yeah, I do. I don't want to be
mentioned on the radio.

190
00:12:30,224 --> 00:12:32,192
You don't want
to be mentioned?

191
00:12:32,226 --> 00:12:33,750
- # She cried more, more, more! #
- No.

192
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:36,024
# With a rebel yell #

193
00:12:36,063 --> 00:12:38,088
- # She cried more, more, more! #
- Okay.

194
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,623
Oh God.

195
00:12:48,676 --> 00:12:50,507
Hey, come on!
Slow down!

196
00:12:50,544 --> 00:12:52,375
- There's children playing here!
- Sorry, sorry, sorry!

197
00:12:52,413 --> 00:12:54,404
- There's children playing here!
- Sorry!

198
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,298
And now, once again,

199
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,304
Detroit's own legendary
Denny Davies.

200
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,366
Okay, it's the Denny Davies show.

201
00:13:22,409 --> 00:13:24,377
and if you're
a regular listener,

202
00:13:24,411 --> 00:13:27,437
and you've just tuned in, you know
that you haven't missed much.

203
00:13:27,481 --> 00:13:29,949
And you know that's the beauty
of the show, right, Shep?

204
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:32,816
You can always just
jump right in here with us

205
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:35,253
- because...
- Because nothing ever happens.

206
00:13:35,289 --> 00:13:37,257
Nothing ever
happens, exactly

207
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:40,021
Now what were we talking about
just before the commercial?

208
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,620
Oh yeah.
The invasion, right?

209
00:13:42,663 --> 00:13:44,631
- See?
- Right?

210
00:13:44,665 --> 00:13:46,792
- You still do have your memory.
- Yeah.

211
00:13:46,834 --> 00:13:49,302
I know what people are saying.
Were you watching TV?

212
00:13:49,336 --> 00:13:51,304
As a matter of fact,
I was watching it

213
00:13:51,338 --> 00:13:53,306
with my drinking buddy
the very sweet,

214
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,308
the very tall
and absolutely sexy

215
00:13:55,342 --> 00:13:57,310
Terry Ann Wolfmeyer.

216
00:13:57,344 --> 00:13:59,812
But you...
but you know what?

217
00:13:59,847 --> 00:14:02,315
- What?
- She doesn't want me to talk about her,

218
00:14:02,349 --> 00:14:05,409
so I'm not gonna do it.
I'm not gonna talk about her.

219
00:14:05,452 --> 00:14:07,079
Not gonna talk
about who?

220
00:14:07,121 --> 00:14:09,851
- Terry Ann Wolfmeyer.
- Terry Ann Wolfmeyer.

221
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,757
I get it. We're not even mentioning
Terry Ann Wolfmeyer's name.

222
00:14:12,793 --> 00:14:15,318
- Nope.
- Is that the game that you're playing?

223
00:14:15,362 --> 00:14:18,160
- Not even gonna bring her up.
- Terry Ann Wolfmeyer.

224
00:14:18,198 --> 00:14:21,599
- You're getting no play.
- On 101 WRIF Detroit.

225
00:14:21,635 --> 00:14:23,796
You're listening
to the Denny Davies show.

226
00:14:23,837 --> 00:14:26,806
What I don't get, is how come
you won't talk about baseball?

227
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,638
With all they pay you every year,
what's with you not talking about base...

228
00:14:29,676 --> 00:14:32,076
Hey, guess what,
guess what, pinhead?

229
00:14:32,112 --> 00:14:34,080
They don't pay me
that much.

230
00:14:34,114 --> 00:14:36,480
He just got flushed.

231
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,618
Okay, that's...

232
00:14:40,654 --> 00:14:42,622
that's it for me folks,
the Poobah's up next,

233
00:14:42,656 --> 00:14:44,624
Big Daddy Arthur P.

234
00:14:44,658 --> 00:14:47,126
But I'll be with you tomorrow,
and you can all call in

235
00:14:47,161 --> 00:14:50,562
give me hell, the radio equivalent
of dunking the clown...

236
00:14:50,597 --> 00:14:52,565
into the water.

237
00:14:52,599 --> 00:14:54,567
WRIF Detroit at 5:00...

238
00:14:54,601 --> 00:14:56,432
That wasn't too bad,
was it, Shep?

239
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,267
Wasn't too... vicious?

240
00:14:58,305 --> 00:15:01,331
No, you were mild today. You probably
only lost about 6 or 7,000 listeners.

241
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,434
You should feel really good
about yourself.

242
00:15:03,477 --> 00:15:05,968
- WRIF or email the Poobah
at Arthur P...

243
00:15:06,013 --> 00:15:07,947
Hey, but what was
all that about?

244
00:15:07,981 --> 00:15:10,347
- All what?
- That whole thing about the woman

245
00:15:10,384 --> 00:15:12,352
you watched the invasion
with? Who's she?

246
00:15:12,386 --> 00:15:14,354
Just a girl.

247
00:15:14,388 --> 00:15:16,686
Yeah, she's one
of the 20-year-olds, isn't she?

248
00:15:16,723 --> 00:15:19,157
From the college thing.
The one I got you.

249
00:15:19,193 --> 00:15:21,161
No.

250
00:15:21,195 --> 00:15:23,425
No, she's not 20.
She's nowhere near 20.

251
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:26,092
In fact, look,
don't superimpose

252
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:28,101
your warped thinking
onto my life, okay?

253
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,602
I got enough problems.

254
00:15:29,636 --> 00:15:31,604
Okay, well,
then while we're at it,

255
00:15:31,638 --> 00:15:33,606
don't knock
my dating habits, okay?

256
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,608
'Cause they keep me young.

257
00:15:35,642 --> 00:15:39,169
I happen to be a walking encyclopedia
of every boy-band that ever existed.

258
00:15:39,213 --> 00:15:42,114
Trust me, you don't get that from dating
Arianna Huffington.

259
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:45,744
Did you, uh, find out about that, uh,
mall opening in Toledo?

260
00:15:45,786 --> 00:15:48,619
- What it's price was?
- Yeah, $10,000.

261
00:15:48,655 --> 00:15:50,714
$10,000 for you
to show up

262
00:15:50,757 --> 00:15:53,658
for one-half an hour.

263
00:15:53,694 --> 00:15:56,060
- You know, it must suck for you...
- You're going.

264
00:15:56,096 --> 00:15:58,894
...not, uh, being me.
- Yeah, almost as much as it must suck

265
00:15:58,932 --> 00:16:01,298
- actually being you.
- And now, your Rock 'n' Roll

266
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,565
- radio chaperone of Detroit...
- Go home.

267
00:16:03,604 --> 00:16:07,062
Seriously. I've got a real
disc jockey to produce.

268
00:16:07,107 --> 00:16:09,132
A die-hard drinking fan
with a serious football problem.

269
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:11,337
My impression of you
in about 15 minutes.

270
00:16:11,378 --> 00:16:14,541
...WRIF Detroit.

271
00:16:14,581 --> 00:16:16,913
That was said with love.

272
00:16:57,591 --> 00:16:59,559
Where's Mom?

273
00:16:59,593 --> 00:17:02,824
She's upstairs
taking a shower.

274
00:17:10,837 --> 00:17:12,532
What are you working on?

275
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,473
What are you looking
in the want-ads for?

276
00:17:14,508 --> 00:17:16,499
A job.

277
00:17:18,011 --> 00:17:20,104
I need to work.
I'm not going to college.

278
00:17:20,147 --> 00:17:22,138
Okay.

279
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:25,084
It's okay with me,
I guess.

280
00:17:25,118 --> 00:17:27,143
Thank you.

281
00:17:27,187 --> 00:17:29,382
- What are you gonna do?
- I want to be a reporter.

282
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:32,517
- A newscaster.
- Well, you have the face for it.

283
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:38,298
Oh. Are you staying
for dinner?

284
00:17:38,332 --> 00:17:41,392
Depends.

285
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,665
If you're making any more
of that chicken, I am.

286
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:09,929
Here you go.

287
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:12,625
A little something
to get you into second gear.

288
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:14,634
What are you doing?

289
00:18:14,668 --> 00:18:17,034
I wasn't looking,
relax.

290
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:19,129
Get out!
Jesus!

291
00:18:19,172 --> 00:18:22,005
I get out, I'm taking
this drink with me.

292
00:18:22,042 --> 00:18:24,101
Have you ever heard
of boundaries?

293
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:26,112
Okay, that's it.

294
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:28,137
I'm drinking them both.

295
00:18:30,017 --> 00:18:32,008
Give me the drink.

296
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,456
I-I wasn't looking.

297
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,481
All right?
I, uh...

298
00:18:39,893 --> 00:18:41,884
I didn't see much.

299
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,855
All right, well...
what are you doing here?

300
00:18:45,899 --> 00:18:48,424
- What do you want?
- Well, little Emily invited me...

301
00:18:48,468 --> 00:18:49,901
for dinner.

302
00:18:49,936 --> 00:18:52,530
- She did?
- Yes, she did,

303
00:18:52,572 --> 00:18:55,302
and I think you know
my position on free food.

304
00:19:02,716 --> 00:19:04,707
Which one of you
recites Brownie?

305
00:19:09,489 --> 00:19:11,719
Come on, your mother
told me once that one of you

306
00:19:11,758 --> 00:19:13,919
recites Brownie,
beautifully.

307
00:19:15,162 --> 00:19:17,130
Oh. Browning,

308
00:19:17,164 --> 00:19:20,031
Elizabeth Barrett Browning
and I was telling you that...

309
00:19:20,067 --> 00:19:22,035
um... Popeye,
a few years back

310
00:19:22,069 --> 00:19:24,367
when you were like,
I don't know, nine or 10 or so.

311
00:19:24,404 --> 00:19:26,133
I had her read Browning
and she used to

312
00:19:26,173 --> 00:19:27,800
commit some
of the poems to memory

313
00:19:27,841 --> 00:19:29,809
and recite them here
at the dinner table.

314
00:19:29,843 --> 00:19:31,811
That's right.

315
00:19:31,845 --> 00:19:33,813
That's what it was.
That sounds...

316
00:19:33,847 --> 00:19:35,815
that sounds good.

317
00:19:35,849 --> 00:19:37,817
I've never heard anything
like it before

318
00:19:37,851 --> 00:19:39,819
but it...
it sounds fun.

319
00:19:39,853 --> 00:19:41,821
To who?

320
00:19:41,855 --> 00:19:44,016
To all of us,
if she can remember.

321
00:19:46,026 --> 00:19:48,017
Popeye?

322
00:19:50,931 --> 00:19:53,399
Can we do this tomorrow night
when I've had notice

323
00:19:53,433 --> 00:19:55,833
and can make plans
to eat somewhere else?

324
00:19:55,869 --> 00:19:57,860
I don't remember any
of them anyway.

325
00:19:59,673 --> 00:20:01,641
I do.

326
00:20:01,675 --> 00:20:03,643
- You do?
- Yeah.

327
00:20:03,677 --> 00:20:06,942
Really?
Wow.

328
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,607
I'm impressed.

329
00:20:08,648 --> 00:20:10,980
Good.
You should be.

330
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:22,061
What's so funny?

331
00:20:23,063 --> 00:20:25,031
Nothing. Just...

332
00:20:25,065 --> 00:20:27,056
You're just all...
I don't know...

333
00:20:28,401 --> 00:20:30,392
very female.

334
00:20:47,554 --> 00:20:50,853
I got her number in Sweden...
from Helen Trailer.

335
00:20:50,891 --> 00:20:52,859
It forwards and I...

336
00:20:52,893 --> 00:20:56,488
called last night.

337
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:59,158
It must've been the middle
of the night there.

338
00:20:59,199 --> 00:21:01,724
It was Grey that answered.
I'm sure of it.

339
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:06,432
Yeah. I hung up
like a six-year-old.

340
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,244
Ah, he'll marry her.
I'd bet any money in the world.

341
00:21:17,918 --> 00:21:20,409
What do you think
you'll do?

342
00:21:20,453 --> 00:21:22,421
Eh, what can I do?

343
00:21:22,455 --> 00:21:24,423
Well, you're set up,
right?

344
00:21:24,457 --> 00:21:26,425
Right?

345
00:21:26,459 --> 00:21:29,724
I mean Grey's got to be
pretty chunky

346
00:21:29,763 --> 00:21:31,526
in the money department,

347
00:21:31,565 --> 00:21:33,430
- plus, you have...
- I have, what?

348
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:37,395
Bills?
Responsibilities?

349
00:21:37,437 --> 00:21:39,405
Four girls?
One that hates me,

350
00:21:39,439 --> 00:21:41,930
two or three that are
leaning that way.

351
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,673
You can have your damn lots
back there, Denny.

352
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:52,177
I'm not here
for the lots.

353
00:21:55,255 --> 00:21:57,621
Then leave.

354
00:21:57,657 --> 00:22:00,922
Any other reason than that
for you to be here, frankly,

355
00:22:00,961 --> 00:22:02,952
is just pitiful.

356
00:22:23,917 --> 00:22:26,249
- Are you okay?
- No.

357
00:22:26,286 --> 00:22:28,277
I'm a wreck.

358
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,381
She's gonna take us
to school.

359
00:22:35,695 --> 00:22:38,721
You see women...

360
00:22:38,765 --> 00:22:41,666
on TV, in the movies,

361
00:22:41,701 --> 00:22:46,001
and they get left
or whatever.

362
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:48,906
You just wanna kick 'em,
they're so whiny.

363
00:22:50,377 --> 00:22:52,368
Look at me.

364
00:22:58,218 --> 00:23:01,483
I hate his guts.
I hate his guts for what he's done.

365
00:23:01,521 --> 00:23:02,988
Oh.

366
00:23:03,023 --> 00:23:04,991
He's a pig,
your dad.

367
00:23:05,025 --> 00:23:07,892
Just a vile, selfish,
horrible pig,

368
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,759
but you know what?

369
00:23:09,796 --> 00:23:11,889
I'm not gonna trash him
to you girls.

370
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:13,923
I'm not.

371
00:23:15,735 --> 00:23:17,703
I hate him too.

372
00:23:17,737 --> 00:23:19,705
I hate him so much.

373
00:23:19,739 --> 00:23:22,207
I know you do, baby.

374
00:23:22,242 --> 00:23:24,733
You're human.
How could you not?

375
00:23:29,883 --> 00:23:32,784
# When your eyes
were open wide #

376
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:38,189
- All right. See you.
- # For the the last... #

377
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:44,263
Hey, hey, wait.

378
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:45,764
Who is that?

379
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,767
He's cute.

380
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,769
That's Gorden Reiner.
He's new.

381
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:51,771
He's from Chicago.

382
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,773
- Go meet him.
- Yeah.

383
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:57,174
I met him. He's not
interested in me.

384
00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:00,236
All he likes to talk about
is bungee jumping.

385
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:03,472
Tell him you're
from a broken home.

386
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:08,579
- I'm serious.
- Should I?

387
00:24:08,621 --> 00:24:10,714
Guys think things
like that are great.

388
00:24:11,858 --> 00:24:16,227
Trust me.
I'm gonna use it.

389
00:24:18,264 --> 00:24:20,232
Hi, Gorden.

390
00:24:20,266 --> 00:24:22,257
Hey.

391
00:24:24,137 --> 00:24:26,128
Did you know I'm
from a broken home?

392
00:24:35,815 --> 00:24:37,806
Okay, bye.

393
00:25:10,216 --> 00:25:12,184
Turn it down.

394
00:25:14,254 --> 00:25:16,950
- Wolfmeyer residence
- Hey, beautiful.

395
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:19,959
It's Denny.

396
00:25:19,993 --> 00:25:21,756
- Which one is this?
- It's Andy.

397
00:25:21,795 --> 00:25:23,763
Bingo. You still
lookin' for work?

398
00:25:23,797 --> 00:25:26,823
- I am.
- Well, I want you to come in tomorrow.

399
00:25:26,866 --> 00:25:29,892
and see Shep Goodman
from my show.

400
00:25:29,936 --> 00:25:31,927
He needs
a production assistant.

401
00:25:31,971 --> 00:25:34,166
Denny, you're kidding me.

402
00:25:34,207 --> 00:25:36,175
- You're amazing.
- Yeah...

403
00:25:36,209 --> 00:25:38,234
well, you tell that
to your mom, we're even.

404
00:25:38,278 --> 00:25:40,746
So you come in tomorrow, okay?
I'll set you two up.

405
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:43,305
Okay!
Thank you so much!

406
00:25:46,986 --> 00:25:48,954
Oh my God.

407
00:25:48,988 --> 00:25:51,013
I might get a job
working on Denny's show.

408
00:25:51,057 --> 00:25:53,025
- Are you kidding me?
- No!

409
00:25:53,059 --> 00:25:56,051
- That would be amazing!
- That would be so cool.

410
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:57,586
- Oh my God.
- What's up?

411
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:59,928
Denny just called.
She might get a job on his show.

412
00:25:59,966 --> 00:26:02,059
Oh, really?
Denny just called here?

413
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:03,933
Yeah, I have an
interview tomorrow

414
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:05,403
for a job.

415
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:07,633
Wait, wait.
What about school?

416
00:26:07,674 --> 00:26:09,938
I want a job.

417
00:26:09,976 --> 00:26:11,841
I'm not going to college.

418
00:26:11,878 --> 00:26:15,245
Wha... you're not going
to college?

419
00:26:15,281 --> 00:26:18,444
No, I told Daddy and he wanted me
to wait to tell you, but now...

420
00:26:18,485 --> 00:26:20,612
Oh, but now that he's off
screwing his assistant,

421
00:26:20,653 --> 00:26:23,144
you think you can safely drop
the bomb on me, is that it?

422
00:26:25,592 --> 00:26:27,560
No.

423
00:26:27,594 --> 00:26:30,791
"No" is right.
You are going to college!

424
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,821
You know damn well
how I feel about this.

425
00:26:35,201 --> 00:26:39,035
All four of you.
You're all goddamn going to college!

426
00:26:42,675 --> 00:26:44,006
I don't have a job open.

427
00:26:44,043 --> 00:26:46,876
It's that simple, Denny.
It's cut and dry.

428
00:26:46,913 --> 00:26:48,881
This girl has something.

429
00:26:48,915 --> 00:26:50,883
She does, Sheppy,
she's sharp.

430
00:26:50,917 --> 00:26:52,885
She has class.

431
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:56,286
You could be hiring the next, um...
Diane Sawyer.

432
00:26:56,322 --> 00:26:59,018
I don't have a job open.

433
00:26:59,058 --> 00:27:01,618
I know you don't,
but you could do this

434
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:03,629
for me, right?
You could do this for me.

435
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:05,563
No, I can't.
Wanna know why?

436
00:27:05,598 --> 00:27:07,566
- Yes, why?
- Okay, I'm gonna come in there.

437
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,295
I'm gonna tell you.
Hold on.

438
00:27:09,335 --> 00:27:11,303
Jesus.

439
00:27:11,337 --> 00:27:13,032
I'm going on
in a second here.

440
00:27:13,072 --> 00:27:15,302
Because, my lord,
I'm too busy doing

441
00:27:15,341 --> 00:27:17,036
other things
for you.

442
00:27:19,078 --> 00:27:20,841
"My lord"?

443
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,906
# I'm looking for #

444
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:28,182
# A simple kind of life.
slow and easy #

445
00:27:28,221 --> 00:27:30,189
- # A life that won't #
- Hi.

446
00:27:30,223 --> 00:27:32,191
- # Bring me down #
- Um, I'm Andy Wolfmeyer,

447
00:27:32,225 --> 00:27:34,887
I'm here to see
Shep Goodman about a job.

448
00:27:34,928 --> 00:27:37,556
Um... Denny Davies
asked me to come in.

449
00:27:37,597 --> 00:27:40,930
Oh, okay. Well, if you'd like
to take a seat over there.

450
00:27:40,967 --> 00:27:44,027
- I'll let him know you're here.
- Okay, thank you.

451
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:46,038
No, you're not
understanding me,

452
00:27:46,072 --> 00:27:48,097
- You're making this really...
- I found one!

453
00:27:48,141 --> 00:27:50,109
I've got an opening.
Something's come up.

454
00:27:50,143 --> 00:27:51,576
I found an opening.

455
00:27:51,611 --> 00:27:53,078
- I'm on the phone.
- Okay.

456
00:27:53,112 --> 00:27:56,013
If you want her to have
the job, I'll make it happen.

457
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:58,415
You'll just owe me, as usual.

458
00:27:58,451 --> 00:28:00,078
I got the job.

459
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:02,781
What job?

460
00:28:02,822 --> 00:28:05,086
With Denny, as a
production assistant.

461
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:15,924
Yes, what?

462
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:17,827
Are you looking
to get laid?

463
00:29:17,864 --> 00:29:19,832
Is... is this
what's going on?

464
00:29:19,866 --> 00:29:21,993
I mean, are-are you
looking for

465
00:29:22,035 --> 00:29:24,094
another notch in your belt,
or... I don't know...

466
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:26,605
whatever it is you super
sports heroes call it.

467
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:28,607
I mean are you
looking to get lucky with me...

468
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:32,008
- to get me into bed?
- Uh, who's calling?

469
00:29:32,045 --> 00:29:34,013
Be straight with me, Denny.

470
00:29:34,047 --> 00:29:36,777
Be straight. Now, Grey always thought
you had an eye for me,

471
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:38,647
and I need you to be
really straight with me now.

472
00:29:38,685 --> 00:29:41,552
Uh, okay. Um...

473
00:29:42,555 --> 00:29:44,648
I do like you.

474
00:29:44,691 --> 00:29:47,285
I always have.
Um...

475
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,295
You wanna have sex with me.
Is that it?

476
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:51,297
No! Uh, no, I mean...

477
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:54,494
um... well, uh...

478
00:29:54,534 --> 00:29:57,401
yeah, if you're offering,
I guess.

479
00:29:57,437 --> 00:29:59,064
Okay then.

480
00:29:59,105 --> 00:30:01,096
I'll be right there.
Give me 10 minutes.

481
00:30:02,542 --> 00:30:05,375
- Uh, ex... excuse me?
- Give me 10 minutes.

482
00:30:05,411 --> 00:30:08,073
I'm not gonna do much with my face,
though, so don't expect much.

483
00:30:08,114 --> 00:30:10,082
In fact,
keep the drapes shut.

484
00:30:10,116 --> 00:30:12,550
I don't like a lot of light.
It's not very light in there, is it?

485
00:30:12,585 --> 00:30:14,553
No, there, uh...

486
00:30:14,587 --> 00:30:16,919
there's not a lot
of light here.

487
00:30:16,956 --> 00:30:18,924
Okay, well,
have a drink.

488
00:30:18,958 --> 00:30:20,755
Have a couple.

489
00:30:20,793 --> 00:30:23,091
I don't want you to have
a real clear memory of this

490
00:30:23,129 --> 00:30:25,188
when it's over, okay?
I'll see you soon.

491
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,905
Slow down!

492
00:30:35,942 --> 00:30:38,001
- Slow down!
- Oh, please. Come on.

493
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:40,740
- There's children playing here!
- Ah, get over yourself!

494
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,771
There's children
playing here!

495
00:30:49,489 --> 00:30:51,457
Hello?

496
00:30:51,491 --> 00:30:53,482
I'm here!

497
00:30:58,564 --> 00:31:00,555
Uh, Denny?

498
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:06,265
Denny?

499
00:31:07,273 --> 00:31:09,264
I'm coming up!

500
00:31:12,345 --> 00:31:14,336
Denny?

501
00:31:38,471 --> 00:31:40,564
Hello?

502
00:31:40,606 --> 00:31:42,574
It's me.

503
00:31:42,608 --> 00:31:45,133
Listen, um,
something came up.

504
00:31:45,178 --> 00:31:47,976
I had a, uh...
I had a call.

505
00:31:48,014 --> 00:31:51,211
They needed me right away
over at the station.

506
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:53,309
- Shep's in some kind of trouble.
- Oh, yeah.

507
00:31:53,352 --> 00:31:55,877
- You are so full of shit.
- I'm not.

508
00:31:55,922 --> 00:31:57,890
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

509
00:31:57,924 --> 00:31:59,915
I'm not and...

510
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,627
in fact, I'd like
a rain check.

511
00:32:02,662 --> 00:32:04,630
It's not gonna happen.

512
00:32:04,664 --> 00:32:06,632
This was like...
Halley's Comet.

513
00:32:06,666 --> 00:32:10,158
It's not coming around
again for 57 years.

514
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,865
What the fuck
is Halley's Comet?

515
00:32:16,909 --> 00:32:18,638
But this is the main
production booth

516
00:32:18,678 --> 00:32:21,146
This is where you and I will be
doing a lot of working.

517
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,410
- Okay.
- Here, come on, I'll show you this.

518
00:32:23,449 --> 00:32:26,646
this is the live
on-air studio. Arthur?

519
00:32:26,686 --> 00:32:28,779
Say hello to my new
assistant Andy Wolfmeyer.

520
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:32,279
- Hello, Andy.
- This is Arthur Pennhallow.

521
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,293
- He's a big deal here in town.
- Yeah.

522
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:37,558
We're friends.
He idolizes me, actually.

523
00:32:37,597 --> 00:32:39,588
The fuck I do.

524
00:32:40,666 --> 00:32:42,634
- He does.
- Okay.

525
00:32:42,668 --> 00:32:45,398
That was a joke. We're tight,
and we're good friends.

526
00:32:45,438 --> 00:32:47,406
Okay.

527
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,000
So what is "Andy" short for?
"Andrea?"

528
00:32:50,042 --> 00:32:52,442
- Yeah, "Andrea."
- Cool. See? I'm good with names.

529
00:32:52,478 --> 00:32:53,809
Yeah.

530
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:55,814
Okay, I'll show you
up at the office now,

531
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:57,816
- where we work a lot up there, too.
- Okay.

532
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,818
Have you seen
an Emmy in person?

533
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:01,820
- You've won an Emmy?
- Couple.

534
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:04,322
Local, but who's counting?
Actually, I have three.

535
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:07,952
There's only two up there, 'cause one
I keep for the hotel room when I travel.

536
00:33:10,563 --> 00:33:12,258
Wow.

537
00:33:23,743 --> 00:33:26,405
Kids, hurry up!
You're gonna be late!

538
00:33:28,948 --> 00:33:30,939
- How's your lunch, Gordon?
- It's good.

539
00:33:37,189 --> 00:33:39,851
Did you ever see that documentary
on the Chicago Seven?

540
00:33:42,194 --> 00:33:44,287
What about the one...

541
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:46,298
the one about
the Kent State killings?

542
00:33:46,332 --> 00:33:49,529
- No.
- Something like...

543
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,537
six people were killed
by the cops,

544
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:53,539
there was
all this turmoil

545
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:56,736
and it got really ugly and just opened
up a lot of old wounds

546
00:33:56,776 --> 00:33:58,266
between the police

547
00:33:58,311 --> 00:34:00,302
and the people
of the area.

548
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:11,151
I'm from
a broken home also.

549
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:13,351
You are?

550
00:34:18,497 --> 00:34:20,624
Hey, do you bungee jump?

551
00:34:22,001 --> 00:34:24,299
- No.
- Well, I do.

552
00:34:24,337 --> 00:34:26,305
I go up with my dad.

553
00:34:26,339 --> 00:34:28,307
We drive up north
to Fenton Valley...

554
00:34:28,341 --> 00:34:31,242
- and bungee jump off this huge crane.
- That sounds exciting.

555
00:34:55,267 --> 00:34:57,667
Well, I read your letter.

556
00:34:57,703 --> 00:34:59,671
Was it too mean?

557
00:34:59,705 --> 00:35:02,367
I don't want it
to be mean.

558
00:35:02,408 --> 00:35:03,841
Well, I mean I do,
but I don't.

559
00:35:03,876 --> 00:35:06,208
Well, he's your father
and he's...

560
00:35:06,245 --> 00:35:09,442
left you
at a very tough time.

561
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:11,882
I know and I want him to know
that it pisses me off he hasn't called.

562
00:35:11,917 --> 00:35:14,112
Oh, he knows.

563
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:16,621
He's not talking to his brother
or his friends at work.

564
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:18,351
He knows what he's done.

565
00:35:18,391 --> 00:35:19,881
Are you gonna call him?

566
00:35:19,925 --> 00:35:22,393
Please?

567
00:35:22,428 --> 00:35:24,293
This is stupid.
It's just a stupid game.

568
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,059
You said you have
his number.

569
00:35:26,098 --> 00:35:28,794
This letter is good.
I mean, it's good for you

570
00:35:28,834 --> 00:35:30,802
to get your feelings out.

571
00:35:30,836 --> 00:35:32,463
Um...

572
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:35,770
I want you eating,
though.

573
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:37,673
You are dancing so much.

574
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,473
Do you think maybe
it's too much?

575
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:42,538
I know you have this out here.
Daddy built it for you,

576
00:35:42,581 --> 00:35:45,482
- but you spend so much time out here.
- You're such a head case.

577
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:48,749
- What?
- Be happy for me.

578
00:35:49,789 --> 00:35:51,757
Be proud! Shit!

579
00:35:51,791 --> 00:35:55,090
You know? I'm focused!
What is your problem?

580
00:35:55,127 --> 00:35:57,755
The only thing you're focused
on is drinking and Denny!

581
00:35:57,797 --> 00:35:59,788
Be glad that I have
a dream!

582
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:05,432
I was just going to tell
you how proud I am of you.

583
00:36:06,439 --> 00:36:08,304
That's the sad thing.

584
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:12,511
What?

585
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:14,513
Well,
I'm not going to now.

586
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:16,344
Not after that outburst.

587
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:18,373
Fine, I don't care.

588
00:36:21,087 --> 00:36:23,146
I'm in the kitchen
making dinner,

589
00:36:23,189 --> 00:36:25,919
and it wouldn't kill you
to come up and help.

590
00:36:27,093 --> 00:36:29,061
Who knows? You may
get there just in time

591
00:36:29,095 --> 00:36:31,086
to pull my head out
of the oven.

592
00:36:55,354 --> 00:36:57,845
- Hello?
- What... what are you doing?

593
00:36:59,458 --> 00:37:02,825
- Oh, making the girls' lunches.
- Good for you.

594
00:37:02,862 --> 00:37:06,093
Yeah, what the hell. I'm going after
the Mother-of-the-year award.

595
00:37:06,132 --> 00:37:08,999
See, um...

596
00:37:09,034 --> 00:37:11,798
- You know what I was thinking?
- No.

597
00:37:11,837 --> 00:37:14,670
Maybe it's been...
57 years.

598
00:37:14,707 --> 00:37:17,801
- What are you talking about?
- Halley's Comet, you know?

599
00:37:17,843 --> 00:37:19,834
By the way, it's, uh...

600
00:37:22,014 --> 00:37:25,040
76 years, but I'll give you
that one, smarty pants.

601
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:30,188
Can I come over?

602
00:37:30,222 --> 00:37:32,190
When?

603
00:37:32,224 --> 00:37:34,192
Now.

604
00:37:34,226 --> 00:37:37,195
- Now?
- Yeah, now.

605
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:42,258
- Did you hang up?
- Uh, not yet.

606
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:44,861
Good, then, um...
I'm coming over.

607
00:37:44,904 --> 00:37:46,667
I am, so...

608
00:37:46,705 --> 00:37:48,502
don't go hide
in the yard,

609
00:37:48,541 --> 00:37:50,975
don't pull any
reciprocal crap.

610
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:53,342
Is that what you did that day?
You hid in the yard?

611
00:37:55,948 --> 00:37:57,939
No, um...

612
00:37:59,051 --> 00:38:01,019
You know what?
Delete that last line.

613
00:38:01,053 --> 00:38:03,021
Look, um...

614
00:38:03,055 --> 00:38:05,023
I'm coming over.
I am.

615
00:38:05,057 --> 00:38:07,048
I'm coming now.

616
00:38:11,597 --> 00:38:13,565
Hold it.
# Hold it! #

617
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:15,567
Wait, wait, wait.

618
00:38:15,601 --> 00:38:17,228
- What is this?
- Your lunches.

619
00:38:17,269 --> 00:38:18,793
- Our lunches?
- Mm-hmm.

620
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,806
- Are you kidding?
- I make my own lunch.

621
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,808
You haven't done
it in years.

622
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,833
I'm back to basics.
What do you want?

623
00:38:27,446 --> 00:38:29,676
- Bye.
- Have a good day!

624
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,513
No!

625
00:39:27,006 --> 00:39:29,770
Oh, shit. Great.

626
00:39:39,451 --> 00:39:41,419
Were you...
you taking off?

627
00:39:41,453 --> 00:39:44,149
Hey. You're taking off,
just like that?

628
00:39:44,189 --> 00:39:46,157
Yeah, I'm going to hide
in your yard.

629
00:39:46,191 --> 00:39:48,682
Oh, come on, that's bullshit.
I was kidding.

630
00:39:49,895 --> 00:39:51,863
- What are you doing?
- Step out.

631
00:39:51,897 --> 00:39:53,888
Just step out.

632
00:39:56,869 --> 00:39:58,837
- Are you stoned?
- Not at all.

633
00:39:58,871 --> 00:40:00,862
- Not a bit.
- Well, you should be.

634
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:04,409
Listen, I, uh...

635
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:08,140
I know that you're fresh.
I know you're good and hurt

636
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,546
and I know that on some level,
this is way too soon...

637
00:40:10,582 --> 00:40:12,550
- and not right.
- Yeah.

638
00:40:12,584 --> 00:40:14,552
What's the other level?

639
00:40:14,586 --> 00:40:17,987
I dial your number
10 times a day and hang up.

640
00:40:18,023 --> 00:40:19,820
Come on!

641
00:40:19,858 --> 00:40:21,985
Just a minute.

642
00:40:22,027 --> 00:40:25,394
Goddamn, Terry, it's not like, you know,
it's not like I'm asking a lot.

643
00:40:25,431 --> 00:40:27,399
It's just...

644
00:40:27,433 --> 00:40:29,401
it's just...

645
00:40:29,435 --> 00:40:31,403
I get it, okay?

646
00:40:31,437 --> 00:40:33,405
I know who I am
for you.

647
00:40:33,439 --> 00:40:35,407
I'm this guy that you sit
and you drink...

648
00:40:35,441 --> 00:40:37,409
and you talk with.

649
00:40:37,443 --> 00:40:40,844
- And now you want to fuck me.
- Well, you offered it.

650
00:40:40,879 --> 00:40:42,847
That was before you hid
in your yard.

651
00:40:42,881 --> 00:40:44,849
Well, I'm not hiding
in my yard, now am I?!

652
00:40:44,883 --> 00:40:47,181
- Hey come on, lady!
- Hey, hey, hey!

653
00:40:47,219 --> 00:40:49,210
Can that horn, now!

654
00:40:50,556 --> 00:40:52,524
Jeez!

655
00:40:52,558 --> 00:40:54,526
Not bad.

656
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,551
Thank you.

657
00:40:57,896 --> 00:41:00,023
You wanna...
go back to my house?

658
00:41:00,065 --> 00:41:01,930
I've seen your house.

659
00:41:05,871 --> 00:41:07,702
I'll make the bed!

660
00:41:09,708 --> 00:41:11,699
Let's go to my house.

661
00:41:13,412 --> 00:41:15,403
Fine, let's go
to your house.

662
00:41:50,249 --> 00:41:52,217
Oh, God.

663
00:41:52,251 --> 00:41:54,913
Now that was
a real misstep.

664
00:41:58,223 --> 00:42:00,191
Aw...

665
00:42:00,225 --> 00:42:02,193
that was
a sweet thing to say.

666
00:42:02,227 --> 00:42:04,991
God, what am I doing?

667
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:07,021
Why am I here?

668
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,427
You're here because
you're sad and lonely.

669
00:42:12,471 --> 00:42:14,439
Desperate.

670
00:42:14,473 --> 00:42:17,806
You need someone,
something,

671
00:42:17,843 --> 00:42:19,811
anything to fill you.
Any...

672
00:42:19,845 --> 00:42:22,643
- port in a storm.
- Mmm.

673
00:42:22,681 --> 00:42:24,649
I asked why I
was here, not you.

674
00:42:24,683 --> 00:42:26,674
What's my story?

675
00:42:28,387 --> 00:42:31,015
Oh, your story is...

676
00:42:32,124 --> 00:42:34,115
you're good
and bent out of shape.

677
00:42:36,061 --> 00:42:39,656
Pissed off like
I've never seen a woman.

678
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,934
What?

679
00:43:13,499 --> 00:43:16,332
Francis Wellard.

680
00:43:16,368 --> 00:43:18,359
Timothy Westerburg.

681
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:22,230
Matthew Wintergarden.

682
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:25,466
Hadley Wolfmeyer!

683
00:43:26,845 --> 00:43:28,676
Stephanie Winnington!

684
00:43:32,351 --> 00:43:34,342
Nancy Woodside.

685
00:43:37,222 --> 00:43:39,622
It's a special day
for her. So, just be nice.

686
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:41,626
- She's excited for you to meet him.
- Oh, really,

687
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:44,754
how excited can she be?
She's been seeing him for three years.

688
00:43:44,796 --> 00:43:46,525
And she's in love?
She's in love?

689
00:43:46,565 --> 00:43:50,194
- I'm just hearing about this today?
- Be nice!

690
00:43:50,235 --> 00:43:52,795
It's not in my nature.
Why does she hate me so damn much?

691
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:55,466
She doesn't hate you,
she just thinks that he's stupid.

692
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:58,704
She thinks he's stupid?!
I thought she loved him.

693
00:43:58,744 --> 00:44:00,678
No, she thinks
you'll think he's stupid.

694
00:44:00,712 --> 00:44:02,680
Well, I won't think that.
That's my point.

695
00:44:02,714 --> 00:44:05,114
She judges me so harshly.
I am her mother.

696
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:07,050
- Okay.
- I love her. I want her to be happy.

697
00:44:07,085 --> 00:44:09,280
I mean, if she loves
this guy I'm gonna love...

698
00:44:09,321 --> 00:44:12,950
- Okie dokie.
- Hi! Hi! Oh, baby!

699
00:44:12,991 --> 00:44:14,959
Baby!

700
00:44:14,993 --> 00:44:17,359
Oh God, I'm so proud
of you! I am!

701
00:44:17,396 --> 00:44:19,364
I am so proud of you.

702
00:44:19,398 --> 00:44:21,195
- Let me see your face.
- Mother.

703
00:44:21,233 --> 00:44:23,997
A college graduate.
I'm so proud of you.

704
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:26,334
Your father doesn't know
what he's missing today.

705
00:44:26,371 --> 00:44:28,339
I think he might.
Mm-mmm!

706
00:44:28,373 --> 00:44:30,204
This is it.
This is life.

707
00:44:30,242 --> 00:44:32,210
Mom?

708
00:44:32,244 --> 00:44:34,906
- David. Hi, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

709
00:44:34,947 --> 00:44:37,313
My parents are having lunch
at the Wheeler hotel.

710
00:44:37,349 --> 00:44:40,045
- You're all invited.
- The Wheeler, really?

711
00:44:40,085 --> 00:44:42,451
We'd... well, girls,
would you like that?

712
00:44:42,487 --> 00:44:44,455
- We... we had lunch.
- Have it again.

713
00:44:44,489 --> 00:44:47,583
Come on, I want us to go.
I want you to meet David's parents.

714
00:44:47,626 --> 00:44:50,561
David you tell your folks
we'd absolutely love to join them, okay?

715
00:44:50,596 --> 00:44:52,564
- Cool. Okay, see you later.
- See you later.

716
00:44:52,598 --> 00:44:54,566
Bye.

717
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,568
Wow.

718
00:44:56,602 --> 00:44:58,570
He is so handsome.

719
00:44:58,604 --> 00:45:00,572
Nice and...

720
00:45:00,606 --> 00:45:02,574
- intelligent.
- Mother.

721
00:45:02,608 --> 00:45:05,236
Oh! He is, baby.
I can tell by looking at him.

722
00:45:05,277 --> 00:45:07,245
He's incredibly
intelligent.

723
00:45:07,279 --> 00:45:09,247
All right...
um...

724
00:45:09,281 --> 00:45:11,249
there's something
you all should know.

725
00:45:11,283 --> 00:45:13,410
You're pregnant
and you're getting married.

726
00:45:13,452 --> 00:45:16,046
How did you know that?
Who told you that?

727
00:45:17,856 --> 00:45:20,051
I guessed?
Really?

728
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:22,083
I guessed that?
I was right?

729
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:25,063
No, you've got
to be kidding me.

730
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:27,725
No, I'm... I'm not.

731
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:29,757
I'm getting married.

732
00:45:31,403 --> 00:45:33,371
This is how I find out?

733
00:45:33,405 --> 00:45:36,306
Through Popeye?
A 15-year-old?

734
00:45:36,341 --> 00:45:38,138
- Don't be condescending...
- Close it!

735
00:45:38,176 --> 00:45:40,144
You are a child.
What do you know?

736
00:45:40,178 --> 00:45:42,146
Oh, that old chestnut.

737
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:44,148
You close it
as well, please.

738
00:45:44,182 --> 00:45:45,809
Do his parents know?

739
00:45:45,851 --> 00:45:47,478
Yes, they're ecstatic.

740
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:49,248
Oh, how long
have they been ecstatic?

741
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:51,483
You know what, can we just
go to the lunch please?

742
00:45:51,523 --> 00:45:53,957
How long have they been
ecstatic, damn you, Hadley?!

743
00:46:01,833 --> 00:46:04,324
I need a Bloody Mary as soon
as is humanly possible.

744
00:46:07,005 --> 00:46:08,973
Hi. I'm Terry.

745
00:46:09,007 --> 00:46:10,975
Oh. Gina.
Nice to meet you.

746
00:46:11,009 --> 00:46:13,375
- Nice to meet you.
- And this is David, my husband.

747
00:46:13,412 --> 00:46:15,403
Oh, David Senior.
That's nice.

748
00:46:15,447 --> 00:46:17,415
You're not Jews, obviously.

749
00:46:19,551 --> 00:46:21,951
Oh, well I mean
not that that's a good or a bad thing.

750
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:24,785
That they don't
just name their children

751
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:27,121
after... okay,
that was horrible.

752
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:29,923
Um... these are
Hadley's sisters,

753
00:46:29,961 --> 00:46:31,656
Emily, Andrea
and Popeye.

754
00:46:31,697 --> 00:46:33,164
- Hi, girls.
- Hi.

755
00:46:33,198 --> 00:46:34,995
Could we order you
a drink before lunch?

756
00:46:35,033 --> 00:46:36,500
Oh, I'm set for now.
Thank you.

757
00:46:36,535 --> 00:46:38,230
Um, I'll have the same.

758
00:46:40,706 --> 00:46:42,196
Mmn. Mmn!

759
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:45,300
So, I understand we have something
to celebrate? Some good news, huh?

760
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:46,936
Oh, we're
very excited, Terry.

761
00:46:46,978 --> 00:46:49,606
We are crazy about Hadley.
We really are.

762
00:46:49,648 --> 00:46:52,845
I knew from the minute
I met her. I did.

763
00:46:52,884 --> 00:46:54,408
- You did not.
- I did.

764
00:46:54,453 --> 00:46:55,886
No, Mother, you didn't.

765
00:46:55,921 --> 00:46:57,889
If she said she did,
she probably did!

766
00:46:57,923 --> 00:46:59,788
Well, I was taken
for a surprise,

767
00:46:59,825 --> 00:47:02,225
- but... but a happy one.
- Yeah, well, you and me both.

768
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:08,925
- Should we toast?
- Oh, yes. Let's do.

769
00:47:08,967 --> 00:47:11,663
Well... to David
and Hadley.

770
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:13,898
- David and Hadley...
- Oh wait, wait, wait.

771
00:47:13,939 --> 00:47:16,032
My glass is...
this is bad luck. Uh, waiter?

772
00:47:16,074 --> 00:47:18,042
Mother, it's okay.
Here.

773
00:47:18,076 --> 00:47:20,704
Oh.

774
00:47:20,746 --> 00:47:22,714
Oh, just...
a little more.

775
00:47:22,748 --> 00:47:24,716
Just...

776
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:26,718
Thank you.

777
00:47:26,752 --> 00:47:28,720
So, shall we toast?

778
00:47:28,754 --> 00:47:31,552
- May I?
- Please, do.

779
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,128
To David and Hadley.

780
00:47:37,162 --> 00:47:40,654
A long and beautiful
partnership.

781
00:47:40,699 --> 00:47:41,893
- Aww.
- Thanks.

782
00:47:41,933 --> 00:47:43,901
The... mostly right now...

783
00:47:43,935 --> 00:47:46,995
I'm sorry, David,
this is very emotional for me.

784
00:47:48,206 --> 00:47:50,174
To my baby.

785
00:47:50,208 --> 00:47:52,438
My first born,
my little Hadley-wadley.

786
00:47:52,477 --> 00:47:54,069
Aww.

787
00:47:54,112 --> 00:47:57,081
That's what we called her.
Hadley-wadley.

788
00:47:57,115 --> 00:47:59,913
She was so loved
from the minute she was born.

789
00:47:59,951 --> 00:48:01,919
Just an adorable
little thing.

790
00:48:01,953 --> 00:48:04,979
She was... well,
she grew up too fast didn't she?

791
00:48:05,023 --> 00:48:07,014
She grew up so fast
and had a mouth on her.

792
00:48:07,058 --> 00:48:08,252
Mother!

793
00:48:08,293 --> 00:48:09,920
When she was in her teens
she was her own little boss.

794
00:48:09,961 --> 00:48:11,019
Mother!

795
00:48:11,062 --> 00:48:12,723
And she would sometimes
just not come home...

796
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:15,164
All right, could we just toast, please?
Thank you.

797
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,033
Okay, baby.
We'll toast.

798
00:48:22,474 --> 00:48:24,442
You have to
forgive me. Um...

799
00:48:24,476 --> 00:48:26,273
you all had a chance
to process this,

800
00:48:26,311 --> 00:48:28,245
and I'm just coming
on board, so to speak.

801
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:31,749
To Hadley-wadley.

802
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:33,774
Hadley-wadley.

803
00:48:41,426 --> 00:48:43,451
Mmn.

804
00:48:46,431 --> 00:48:47,898
Oh.

805
00:48:47,933 --> 00:48:49,901
Oh!

806
00:48:49,935 --> 00:48:51,630
Oh, no, no.
I'm done toasting.

807
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:53,661
I'm just ordering
another drink.

808
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:57,108
- It was horrible.
- Maybe it wasn't.

809
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:59,110
Maybe it wasn't
as bad as you thought.

810
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:01,112
No, it was horrible.

811
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:03,580
It was. I made an ass
of myself. I was like...

812
00:49:03,615 --> 00:49:06,277
a public service film
against drinking.

813
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:08,286
Just...

814
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,288
yeah, I was an old lush.

815
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:12,290
Poor Hadley.

816
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:14,292
I feel so bad
for her, Denny.

817
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:16,851
Why are we going
out here?

818
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:20,598
I hate the way
I come off to my girls.

819
00:49:20,632 --> 00:49:22,725
I just hate that I can't
control my emotions.

820
00:49:25,804 --> 00:49:27,499
Oh God.

821
00:49:27,539 --> 00:49:29,530
This is creepy.

822
00:49:32,744 --> 00:49:34,712
This was all a farm
owned by the...

823
00:49:34,746 --> 00:49:36,714
Firestone family
until the 50's.

824
00:49:36,748 --> 00:49:38,477
This and the whole
subdivision.

825
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:41,179
It goes on a bit
about another eight acres.

826
00:49:43,588 --> 00:49:45,579
Why are we out
here today?

827
00:49:47,492 --> 00:49:49,483
I wanna do it.

828
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,191
- Out here?
- No.

829
00:49:53,231 --> 00:49:55,199
Don't be an asshole.

830
00:49:55,233 --> 00:49:57,224
I wanna sell
my part of it.

831
00:49:58,637 --> 00:50:00,901
Just let your friends develop
the lots and tell them "Yes."

832
00:50:00,939 --> 00:50:02,429
Tell them I don't need
the money, though.

833
00:50:02,474 --> 00:50:05,136
If they think I need the money,
they'll play games with me.

834
00:50:06,811 --> 00:50:09,075
- Do you?
- No.

835
00:50:09,114 --> 00:50:11,674
Yes. No.
I don't know.

836
00:50:13,752 --> 00:50:15,720
I'm in some trouble...

837
00:50:15,754 --> 00:50:17,813
unless I officially
divorce the shitbox

838
00:50:17,856 --> 00:50:19,824
which I refuse to do,

839
00:50:19,858 --> 00:50:22,486
until at least he has
the balls to show his face.

840
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:30,691
I wanna give
the girls the money.

841
00:50:31,870 --> 00:50:34,202
Just tell your friend Shep
I want to make the deal.

842
00:50:36,942 --> 00:50:38,933
What?

843
00:50:40,078 --> 00:50:42,376
Nothin'.

844
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:44,109
Good.
I'm going in.

845
00:50:44,149 --> 00:50:46,413
This place is a clearinghouse
for Lime disease.

846
00:50:56,227 --> 00:50:58,388
- Hey, this is cute.
- Shep...

847
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:00,728
- How are you, pal?
- I'm doing great.

848
00:51:00,765 --> 00:51:02,733
I'm hanging with Andy,
how could I not be?

849
00:51:02,767 --> 00:51:04,291
Hello, Terry.

850
00:51:04,336 --> 00:51:06,327
Hadley...

851
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:10,798
Hadley's boyfriend.

852
00:51:10,842 --> 00:51:12,810
Okay, okay.

853
00:51:12,844 --> 00:51:15,244
- We're gonna go watch a movie.
- Isn't that sweet?

854
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:19,080
"The Bicycle Thief."
She's never seen "The Bicycle Thief."

855
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:20,744
He's a nut
for foreign cinema.

856
00:51:20,785 --> 00:51:22,446
Anyone wanna join us?

857
00:51:22,487 --> 00:51:25,115
Snuggle up on the couch?
Watch a classic?

858
00:51:31,763 --> 00:51:33,697
I think we'll, uh,
probably pass.

859
00:51:33,732 --> 00:51:36,098
Is it the subtitles?

860
00:51:37,102 --> 00:51:39,070
You know me too well.

861
00:51:39,104 --> 00:51:41,766
I do and it's a burden.

862
00:51:43,775 --> 00:51:45,743
- I know him too well...
- Okay.

863
00:51:45,777 --> 00:51:47,745
so it's a burden.
That's it.

864
00:51:47,779 --> 00:51:49,212
Okay.

865
00:51:49,247 --> 00:51:52,648
I cannot tell you how much
this thing disgusts me.

866
00:51:52,684 --> 00:51:54,652
Oh, come on.
She's doing great at work.

867
00:51:54,686 --> 00:51:57,177
Shep's got her producing
morning drive-time,

868
00:51:57,222 --> 00:52:00,453
plus... I think
he really likes her.

869
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:02,858
Oh, the whole thing
just infuriates me.

870
00:52:02,894 --> 00:52:04,885
That's probably half
the attraction.

871
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:10,668
What?

872
00:52:10,702 --> 00:52:13,000
You know what.
Not another word.

873
00:52:28,053 --> 00:52:29,520
The deep hatred that men
have felt for one another

874
00:52:29,721 --> 00:52:32,656
through the ages has blossomed
into one chapter after another

875
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:36,388
of repression,
violence, hate, rape,

876
00:52:36,428 --> 00:52:38,328
religious slang
and genocide.

877
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:40,923
I'm still working on it.

878
00:52:40,965 --> 00:52:43,729
I need to fix the music.

879
00:52:43,768 --> 00:52:45,702
It's my final
in television production.

880
00:52:56,514 --> 00:52:58,505
You're really handsome,
Gorden.

881
00:52:59,884 --> 00:53:01,875
Thanks.

882
00:53:11,329 --> 00:53:13,320
I should go.

883
00:53:18,436 --> 00:53:20,427
I really do have to go.

884
00:53:25,877 --> 00:53:28,437
The power of stress
and naked anger

885
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,710
is seen over and over again
in the relationships

886
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:33,445
that exist between the male
and the female of our species.

887
00:53:33,485 --> 00:53:36,181
Here, in rural Botswana,
an unfaithful tribeswoman

888
00:53:36,221 --> 00:53:38,086
is brought to a field
by a group of locals

889
00:53:38,123 --> 00:53:40,683
for a ritualized punishment
of beating and harassment.

890
00:53:40,725 --> 00:53:43,751
Events quickly spiral out of control
for the tribesmen, though

891
00:53:43,795 --> 00:53:46,025
as the woman's fury
becomes too great to contain

892
00:53:46,064 --> 00:53:49,227
and the men are quickly forced
to flee for their safety.

893
00:54:28,173 --> 00:54:30,334
Why am I not excited by it?

894
00:54:30,375 --> 00:54:33,902
Um, because I don't think
any of these new age arts colleges

895
00:54:33,945 --> 00:54:35,913
are really colleges.

896
00:54:35,947 --> 00:54:38,472
Of course, it's a college.
What are you talking about?

897
00:54:38,516 --> 00:54:41,178
Honey, I've been there.
I have.

898
00:54:41,219 --> 00:54:43,187
I wanted to be a poet,
remember?

899
00:54:43,221 --> 00:54:45,189
Just take arts courses
at Ann Arbor.

900
00:54:45,223 --> 00:54:47,487
I don't want to go
to school in Ann Arbor.

901
00:54:47,525 --> 00:54:50,551
No, of course you don't. It's what
I want you to do. Why would you?

902
00:54:50,595 --> 00:54:53,120
Okay, four years learning
dance theory?

903
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:55,064
I have a theory about that.

904
00:54:55,099 --> 00:54:57,090
It's not going to happen.

905
00:55:11,416 --> 00:55:13,407
How's the show?
You enjoying it?

906
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:24,685
I wish you would
take me seriously.

907
00:55:24,729 --> 00:55:26,697
Honey, I take you seriously.

908
00:55:26,731 --> 00:55:29,723
I just don't think you have much
capacity for self-evaluation.

909
00:55:29,767 --> 00:55:32,736
You know, you'd think
you'd be happy for me...

910
00:55:32,770 --> 00:55:34,738
considering the way
your life turned out.

911
00:55:34,772 --> 00:55:37,832
- The way your parents pushed you...
- To marry your father?

912
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:40,071
- Yeah.
- I'm not complaining.

913
00:55:41,446 --> 00:55:43,414
They pushed me
to take life seriously...

914
00:55:43,448 --> 00:55:45,439
not to live
in the clouds.

915
00:55:49,287 --> 00:55:51,915
Do you have any idea
what a fucking idiot

916
00:55:51,956 --> 00:55:54,220
you sound like
sometimes?

917
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:03,701
I love how you worry
that the letter

918
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:06,898
you sent to the parent
who deserted you is too mean,

919
00:56:06,938 --> 00:56:09,270
and yet, to the one
who's here in the fight,

920
00:56:09,307 --> 00:56:12,208
you have no problem
saying the most vile things.

921
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:13,904
Isn't that a tad odd?

922
00:56:21,019 --> 00:56:23,783
Please finish setting
the table.

923
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:42,930
Fuck you!

924
00:56:45,209 --> 00:56:47,177
Shep, wake up.
Wake up, wake up.

925
00:56:47,211 --> 00:56:49,338
- Hey.
- Oh, it's 5:00.

926
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:50,472
Okay, 5:00. Just...

927
00:56:50,515 --> 00:56:52,642
No, my mother's downstairs
we need to get up.

928
00:56:52,684 --> 00:56:54,948
We need to get up right...
Ah, hello!

929
00:56:54,986 --> 00:56:57,147
Okay, not now.
We need to get...

930
00:56:57,188 --> 00:56:58,985
- No, we need to get up.
- And...

931
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:02,449
My...

932
00:57:04,128 --> 00:57:06,119
G... God!

933
00:57:19,143 --> 00:57:21,111
Wow.

934
00:57:21,145 --> 00:57:23,113
That was weird, huh?

935
00:57:23,147 --> 00:57:25,115
Yeah.

936
00:58:12,897 --> 00:58:15,229
And according to a recent report,
the average male waist size

937
00:58:15,266 --> 00:58:17,393
in the United States
has increased four sizes

938
00:58:17,435 --> 00:58:20,370
in the last 10 years.
From 34 to 38.

939
00:58:20,405 --> 00:58:22,373
See, here's my question.

940
00:58:22,407 --> 00:58:24,637
When are they going to stop
calling it 'average? '

941
00:58:24,675 --> 00:58:26,700
Just start calling it
what it is. "Fat ass!"

942
00:58:26,744 --> 00:58:28,712
You have a fat ass!

943
00:58:28,746 --> 00:58:30,714
Say something to her.

944
00:58:34,752 --> 00:58:36,743
- Go in there.
- No.

945
00:58:38,623 --> 00:58:41,456
- Do you mind if I do?
- Yes, I do mind.

946
00:58:41,492 --> 00:58:43,483
Quite a bit.

947
00:58:46,564 --> 00:58:49,294
All right.

948
00:58:49,333 --> 00:58:51,301
Well...

949
00:58:51,335 --> 00:58:52,962
Well what?

950
00:58:53,971 --> 00:58:55,962
Well...

951
00:58:57,742 --> 00:59:00,802
I didn't quite actually have the end
of that thought worked out.

952
00:59:03,681 --> 00:59:05,672
It's late.

953
00:59:07,452 --> 00:59:09,420
I think you should
go home, Denny.

954
00:59:09,454 --> 00:59:11,513
I think it's going to be
nothing but trouble,

955
00:59:11,556 --> 00:59:14,389
you staying here
tonight.

956
00:59:14,425 --> 00:59:17,121
Well, if you want me
to leave, just say so.

957
00:59:24,402 --> 00:59:26,393
That was a joke.

958
00:59:35,046 --> 00:59:37,412
...English National
Ballet School

959
00:59:37,448 --> 00:59:39,416
under the direction
of Katherine Wade

960
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:41,509
perform their highly
acclaimed production...

961
00:59:41,552 --> 00:59:43,520
Can we talk?

962
00:59:43,554 --> 00:59:45,784
Not now,
I have a stomachache.

963
00:59:47,892 --> 00:59:50,156
Well, can I get
you anything?

964
00:59:50,194 --> 00:59:52,185
No, but you can shut
the door.

965
01:00:26,931 --> 01:00:28,899
I'm gay.

966
01:00:28,933 --> 01:00:30,924
What?

967
01:00:32,970 --> 01:00:34,699
No.

968
01:00:34,739 --> 01:00:36,639
No, no, no.
You're not.

969
01:00:36,674 --> 01:00:38,642
Yeah.

970
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:40,576
I am.

971
01:00:42,413 --> 01:00:44,404
Are you lying to get out
of kissing me?

972
01:00:48,286 --> 01:00:50,277
Have you ever
had gay sex?

973
01:00:53,991 --> 01:00:55,982
What about sex
with a woman?

974
01:00:59,130 --> 01:01:02,361
Look, you can't be gay
if you haven't tried it.

975
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,368
Or at least tried it
with a girl

976
01:01:04,402 --> 01:01:07,064
to know that you don't
like it with girls.

977
01:01:07,104 --> 01:01:09,072
No.

978
01:01:09,106 --> 01:01:11,631
I like men,
because I'm gay.

979
01:01:14,045 --> 01:01:16,036
I think you're lying.

980
01:01:17,148 --> 01:01:19,139
I do, and I think
it's mean.

981
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:23,020
Have sex with me.

982
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:25,045
Just try it

983
01:01:25,089 --> 01:01:27,284
and then, if you want to be gay,
you can be gay.

984
01:01:27,325 --> 01:01:29,316
That's nice of you.

985
01:01:57,088 --> 01:02:00,114
Hi. Um, I came
to apologize.

986
01:02:00,157 --> 01:02:02,125
- Did you?
- I did.

987
01:02:02,159 --> 01:02:03,956
I've been
a real shit to you.

988
01:02:03,995 --> 01:02:06,520
Yes, you have.

989
01:02:06,564 --> 01:02:08,361
What's this?

990
01:02:08,399 --> 01:02:10,128
Well, I just want to do
something nice for you.

991
01:02:10,167 --> 01:02:11,566
I want to clean
your house.

992
01:02:11,602 --> 01:02:14,435
What if I don't want
my house cleaned?

993
01:02:14,472 --> 01:02:17,805
Well, come on. Just don't be defensive
and shitty because I've been shitty.

994
01:02:17,842 --> 01:02:18,934
- Let us in, okay?
- No. No.

995
01:02:18,976 --> 01:02:21,069
No, come on. We're not gonna destroy
it, we're gonna clean it.

996
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:23,137
I don't want my house
cleaned, Terry, okay?

997
01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:25,171
I just want you
to be nice to me, okay?

998
01:02:27,018 --> 01:02:28,986
You know something?

999
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:31,454
What?

1000
01:02:34,492 --> 01:02:36,460
Nothing.

1001
01:02:36,494 --> 01:02:39,952
Right. Then move,
I'm coming in to clean.

1002
01:02:50,374 --> 01:02:52,342
These...

1003
01:02:52,376 --> 01:02:54,344
are all inventoried,
okay?

1004
01:02:54,378 --> 01:02:56,346
I know how many boxes
are here.

1005
01:02:56,380 --> 01:02:59,349
- And what does that mean?
- You know what it means.

1006
01:03:00,785 --> 01:03:02,753
I don't know
this crew.

1007
01:03:02,787 --> 01:03:04,778
You don't either.

1008
01:03:06,057 --> 01:03:08,025
This is why I don't like
people over.

1009
01:03:08,059 --> 01:03:10,459
I don't like too many people
knowing what I have here.

1010
01:03:10,494 --> 01:03:12,485
They're balls, Denny,
not gold bullion.

1011
01:03:14,465 --> 01:03:16,433
Yeah, well...
say what you want

1012
01:03:16,467 --> 01:03:18,458
but they keep me
in firewood.

1013
01:03:26,711 --> 01:03:28,702
I do what I have to do.

1014
01:03:30,514 --> 01:03:32,482
I'm not ashamed.

1015
01:03:32,516 --> 01:03:34,507
I didn't say
you should be.

1016
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:38,018
Other...

1017
01:03:39,857 --> 01:03:41,825
Other guys
I played with, they, uh...

1018
01:03:41,859 --> 01:03:44,623
pulled car dealerships
out their asses, you know,

1019
01:03:44,662 --> 01:03:47,222
ran insurance companies
after they retired?

1020
01:03:48,399 --> 01:03:50,390
That wasn't me.

1021
01:03:52,103 --> 01:03:54,094
I get by, though.

1022
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:57,808
You wanna have a drink?

1023
01:03:57,842 --> 01:03:59,833
You know me pretty well,
what do you think?

1024
01:04:05,149 --> 01:04:07,413
So what is it
about you and baseball?

1025
01:04:09,387 --> 01:04:11,685
Aw, come on, why don't you just
call in to the show

1026
01:04:11,722 --> 01:04:13,690
if you're gonna hit me
with that one.

1027
01:04:13,724 --> 01:04:15,851
Come on, really.
What are you so touchy about?

1028
01:04:15,893 --> 01:04:17,690
Nothing.
I'm just not sure

1029
01:04:17,728 --> 01:04:19,719
what they want from
me anymore, you know?

1030
01:04:20,798 --> 01:04:22,766
It was good.
It was grand.

1031
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:26,099
Nice. Next.
It's over.

1032
01:04:26,137 --> 01:04:29,129
I don't want to talk
about it anymore.

1033
01:04:29,173 --> 01:04:31,573
And I realize
I'm a walking contradiction.

1034
01:04:31,609 --> 01:04:33,577
You know, hocking balls...

1035
01:04:33,611 --> 01:04:35,579
going to malls,
having my picture taken

1036
01:04:35,613 --> 01:04:37,604
in a room
full of fat fucks.

1037
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:44,888
It's just...
you know, it's... I'm... I'm tired, okay?

1038
01:04:44,922 --> 01:04:48,722
- I'm just...
- Yeah, I know. Moving ahead is hard.

1039
01:04:48,759 --> 01:04:51,557
No, I don't
have a problem

1040
01:04:51,595 --> 01:04:53,586
with moving ahead.

1041
01:04:59,336 --> 01:05:02,328
You know what it is I like about going
over to your house, Terry?

1042
01:05:04,041 --> 01:05:06,009
I like how it smells.

1043
01:05:06,043 --> 01:05:08,034
Something's always cooking.

1044
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:12,246
My house doesn't smell
like that.

1045
01:05:12,283 --> 01:05:15,184
And I don't even mind
going over there when there's tension,

1046
01:05:15,219 --> 01:05:17,744
and there's a... there's a fucking
lot of it, you know?

1047
01:05:17,788 --> 01:05:20,279
Somebody is always
mad at somebody.

1048
01:05:20,324 --> 01:05:22,292
Doors are slammin'.

1049
01:05:22,326 --> 01:05:24,317
Fur's flyin'.

1050
01:05:25,496 --> 01:05:28,363
Even when no one
is talkin', it's...

1051
01:05:28,399 --> 01:05:30,367
it's loud.

1052
01:05:30,401 --> 01:05:32,392
But at least
it's fucking real.

1053
01:05:38,342 --> 01:05:41,834
Believe me, this is not where I saw
my life going, okay?

1054
01:05:41,879 --> 01:05:44,609
This is not how
I would've drawn it.

1055
01:05:48,519 --> 01:05:50,510
But I'm okay
with all of it.

1056
01:05:55,159 --> 01:05:57,150
Well...

1057
01:05:57,194 --> 01:05:59,162
lucky me.

1058
01:05:59,196 --> 01:06:01,164
No.

1059
01:06:01,198 --> 01:06:03,166
No.

1060
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,191
Lucky me.

1061
01:06:09,173 --> 01:06:11,141
When I'm with you, Terry...

1062
01:06:11,175 --> 01:06:13,166
with your girls...

1063
01:06:15,779 --> 01:06:17,644
I feel like there's
a big chunk of my life

1064
01:06:17,681 --> 01:06:19,672
still left
to be played out.

1065
01:06:21,552 --> 01:06:23,520
And that's what
I want to talk about,

1066
01:06:23,554 --> 01:06:25,545
not... baseball.

1067
01:06:27,591 --> 01:06:31,288
I've had my heart broken
really badly, Denny.

1068
01:06:34,532 --> 01:06:36,523
I know.

1069
01:06:37,935 --> 01:06:39,903
It's not the kind
of thing that ever heals.

1070
01:06:39,937 --> 01:06:42,371
Yeah, it does. It heals.
It just heals funny.

1071
01:06:42,406 --> 01:06:44,374
You know, you more
or less walk...

1072
01:06:44,408 --> 01:06:46,035
with a limp.

1073
01:06:50,314 --> 01:06:52,282
Well, we'll...

1074
01:06:52,316 --> 01:06:55,183
we'll figure out a way
to be okay with that.

1075
01:06:55,219 --> 01:06:56,777
You know...

1076
01:06:56,820 --> 01:06:58,811
with the limp.

1077
01:07:12,269 --> 01:07:16,103
# Oh, she may be weary #

1078
01:07:16,140 --> 01:07:20,600
# And young girls,
they do get weary #

1079
01:07:20,644 --> 01:07:23,613
# Wearing that... #

1080
01:07:23,647 --> 01:07:26,616
# Mm-hmm. #

1081
01:07:26,650 --> 01:07:28,618
I'm showing.

1082
01:07:28,652 --> 01:07:30,620
I can't... I'm so pissed off
I'm showing.

1083
01:07:30,654 --> 01:07:32,281
Well, you're not
showing that bad.

1084
01:07:32,323 --> 01:07:34,450
Another two weeks,
and we'd have to elope.

1085
01:07:34,491 --> 01:07:36,482
I have to go
get my bracelet.

1086
01:07:41,498 --> 01:07:44,126
I hate the fact that so many people
know she's pregnant.

1087
01:07:44,168 --> 01:07:46,398
Half of them, she's told.
I think she's actually

1088
01:07:46,437 --> 01:07:48,735
- proud of herself for this.
- What's the big deal?

1089
01:07:48,772 --> 01:07:50,501
She would have gotten
married anyway.

1090
01:07:50,541 --> 01:07:52,168
I know, sweetie,
she's a doll.

1091
01:07:52,209 --> 01:07:54,439
I just wish she could learn to keep
her goddamn mouth shut.

1092
01:07:54,478 --> 01:07:56,309
Hey.

1093
01:07:57,314 --> 01:07:59,282
- Do I look horrible?
- No.

1094
01:07:59,316 --> 01:08:01,045
- Tell me the truth.
- Are you kidding?

1095
01:08:01,085 --> 01:08:02,950
You... are...

1096
01:08:02,987 --> 01:08:05,512
a beautiful,
gorgeous bride.

1097
01:08:05,556 --> 01:08:07,524
- I am?
- Yes.

1098
01:08:07,558 --> 01:08:10,288
You are. You look
perfect in that dress.

1099
01:08:10,327 --> 01:08:13,785
Elegant and classy
and sexy and fresh

1100
01:08:13,831 --> 01:08:15,799
and your skin
looks great.

1101
01:08:15,833 --> 01:08:18,233
And your face is big and plump
and healthy-looking.

1102
01:08:18,268 --> 01:08:20,395
- Oh, I could just eat you up!
- My face is plump?

1103
01:08:20,437 --> 01:08:22,405
Oh, God.
No, I didn't...

1104
01:08:22,439 --> 01:08:24,304
- My...
- I didn't mean plump as in plump.

1105
01:08:24,341 --> 01:08:25,638
You said my face
looks plump.

1106
01:08:25,676 --> 01:08:27,940
No, I meant plump
like "adorable."

1107
01:08:27,978 --> 01:08:29,502
- Liar!
- I did! Sweetheart...

1108
01:08:29,546 --> 01:08:32,515
I have a fat face on my wedding day
and you... you know it!

1109
01:08:32,549 --> 01:08:35,279
You do not have a fat face, a plump
face, she didn't mean it, I swear.

1110
01:08:35,319 --> 01:08:38,186
- She just told me my face looked fat.
- Sweetheart... honey...

1111
01:08:38,222 --> 01:08:41,316
You're... wh... 10 minutes before my
wedding ceremony? That's just mean.

1112
01:08:41,358 --> 01:08:43,383
Well, what about all the beautiful things
that I said with that?

1113
01:08:43,427 --> 01:08:45,156
- Can we focus on those?
- Right, right, right.

1114
01:08:45,195 --> 01:08:47,720
- Nice fat face, Hadley. Go get married.
- Hadley! Ha...

1115
01:08:47,765 --> 01:08:49,756
Hadley...

1116
01:08:51,535 --> 01:08:53,526
Okay.

1117
01:08:56,140 --> 01:08:58,108
She'll be fine.

1118
01:08:58,142 --> 01:09:02,602
...what potential
the bonds of marriage hold for us.

1119
01:09:02,646 --> 01:09:06,707
To walk together
into the fog of the future.

1120
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:08,718
Two partners, together...

1121
01:09:08,752 --> 01:09:10,720
in concert...

1122
01:09:10,754 --> 01:09:12,722
in tandem...

1123
01:09:12,756 --> 01:09:15,589
in holy matrimony.

1124
01:09:15,626 --> 01:09:19,892
Is any bond as sacred
as this one?

1125
01:09:19,930 --> 01:09:23,832
Is any promise
more permanent?

1126
01:09:23,867 --> 01:09:26,893
# Girl #

1127
01:09:26,937 --> 01:09:30,236
# You'll be a woman #

1128
01:09:30,274 --> 01:09:32,265
# Soon #

1129
01:09:34,244 --> 01:09:36,576
# I love you so much
can't count all the ways #

1130
01:09:36,613 --> 01:09:38,945
# I'd die for you girl
and all they can say is #

1131
01:09:38,982 --> 01:09:42,213
# "He's not your kind" #

1132
01:09:42,252 --> 01:09:44,220
# They never get tired
of putting me down #

1133
01:09:44,254 --> 01:09:47,348
# And I'll never know
when I come around #

1134
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:49,359
# What I'm gonna find #

1135
01:09:49,393 --> 01:09:51,224
- # Don't let them make up your mind #
- Emily.

1136
01:09:51,261 --> 01:09:53,729
Would you like
to dance with me?

1137
01:09:53,764 --> 01:09:56,562
I don't think so. I have
a stomachache right now.

1138
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:59,194
Oh, bullshit.
Come on.

1139
01:09:59,236 --> 01:10:01,204
- # You'll be a woman soon #
- Come on.

1140
01:10:01,238 --> 01:10:03,468
I don't... I don't want her
or any of them to judge me.

1141
01:10:03,507 --> 01:10:05,441
- # Please #
- Okay.

1142
01:10:05,476 --> 01:10:08,968
- # Come take my hand #
- I don't want them judging me either.

1143
01:10:11,014 --> 01:10:14,108
# Girl #

1144
01:10:14,151 --> 01:10:19,054
# You'll be a woman...
soon #

1145
01:10:19,089 --> 01:10:22,149
# Soon #

1146
01:10:22,192 --> 01:10:26,720
# You'll need a man #

1147
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:29,255
# I've been misunderstood
for all of my life #

1148
01:10:29,299 --> 01:10:31,859
# But that's what they're sayin',
it cuts like a knife #

1149
01:10:31,902 --> 01:10:34,336
# "The boy's no good" #

1150
01:10:34,371 --> 01:10:37,238
# When I've finally found
what I'm looking for #

1151
01:10:37,274 --> 01:10:39,504
# If they get the chance,
they'll end it for sure #

1152
01:10:39,543 --> 01:10:42,410
# They surely would #

1153
01:10:42,446 --> 01:10:45,210
# Baby, I've done
all I could #

1154
01:10:45,249 --> 01:10:49,777
# Now, it's up
to you girl #

1155
01:10:55,659 --> 01:10:58,389
I'll have, um,
a coke, please.

1156
01:10:58,428 --> 01:11:00,055
Coke?

1157
01:11:00,097 --> 01:11:02,361
Not drinking today?

1158
01:11:05,636 --> 01:11:07,604
Okay, nice talking
to you.

1159
01:11:07,638 --> 01:11:09,265
# Have you heard
the news? #

1160
01:11:09,306 --> 01:11:12,605
# It's all over town,
if you ain't heard it boys #

1161
01:11:12,643 --> 01:11:15,009
- # You'd better sit down #
- What is your problem?

1162
01:11:15,045 --> 01:11:17,172
I don't have a problem.
I'm having a nice day.

1163
01:11:17,214 --> 01:11:20,672
Running around with young women half
your age. I mean, what is that about?

1164
01:11:20,717 --> 01:11:25,017
You manipulate young women,
use your power and title

1165
01:11:25,055 --> 01:11:28,081
to seduce them, and get them
to run around with you.

1166
01:11:28,125 --> 01:11:30,616
- Yeah, so?
- It makes me sick,

1167
01:11:30,661 --> 01:11:32,629
the thought of you
with my daughter.

1168
01:11:32,663 --> 01:11:35,223
Well, here's a tip.
Don't think about it.

1169
01:11:38,569 --> 01:11:40,537
Goddamn.

1170
01:11:40,571 --> 01:11:43,597
# Betty Lou's
getting out tonight #

1171
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:46,040
# Betty Lou's getting
out tonight #

1172
01:11:46,076 --> 01:11:48,704
# Betty Lou's
getting out tonight #

1173
01:11:48,745 --> 01:11:51,578
# She was bad,
her mama got mad #

1174
01:11:51,615 --> 01:11:53,742
# But her mama
said it's all right #

1175
01:11:53,784 --> 01:11:55,775
Who should
I sleep with, Terry?

1176
01:11:55,819 --> 01:11:58,686
Women like you?

1177
01:11:58,722 --> 01:12:01,213
- # Betty Lou's getting out tonight #
- Your age? My age?

1178
01:12:01,258 --> 01:12:03,624
- I don't. You know why?
- # Betty Lou #

1179
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:06,026
- 'Cause younger women are nice.
- # It's all true #

1180
01:12:06,063 --> 01:12:09,294
You take them out,
they're actually grateful.

1181
01:12:09,333 --> 01:12:11,563
- "Oh, look a steak. Yummy."
- # It's really true #

1182
01:12:11,602 --> 01:12:13,570
You go for a walk
after dinner

1183
01:12:13,604 --> 01:12:15,572
the air smells nice.
They say, "Thank you.

1184
01:12:15,606 --> 01:12:17,574
this was nice.

1185
01:12:17,608 --> 01:12:19,576
This was fun.
You're funny.

1186
01:12:19,610 --> 01:12:21,908
Tee hee."

1187
01:12:21,945 --> 01:12:24,311
What should I do, Terry?
Settle down and marry

1188
01:12:24,348 --> 01:12:26,316
some pissed off
thing like you?

1189
01:12:26,350 --> 01:12:28,750
I'd rather have someone
come over and do dental work

1190
01:12:28,785 --> 01:12:30,719
every day,
from my backside

1191
01:12:30,754 --> 01:12:33,882
up through my ass.

1192
01:12:33,924 --> 01:12:36,984
# Come on!
Play it, Betty Lou #

1193
01:12:38,662 --> 01:12:40,630
You gonna slap me
in the face again?

1194
01:12:40,664 --> 01:12:42,632
No, probably not.

1195
01:12:42,666 --> 01:12:44,657
# Oh, come on! #

1196
01:12:50,841 --> 01:12:53,139
# Have you heard
the news? #

1197
01:12:53,176 --> 01:12:55,144
# It's all over town #

1198
01:12:55,178 --> 01:12:57,476
# If you ain't heard it, boys,
you'd better sit down #

1199
01:12:57,514 --> 01:13:00,506
A vodka and orange
juice, please.

1200
01:13:00,550 --> 01:13:03,383
# Brace yourself now
and take a deep breath #

1201
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:06,321
# Grab hold of something,
gotta hold on tight #

1202
01:13:06,356 --> 01:13:09,257
- # Betty Lou's getting out tonight #
- There you are.

1203
01:13:09,293 --> 01:13:12,319
# First heard the rumor
down on 12th and Main... #

1204
01:13:12,362 --> 01:13:15,160
- What did you just say to Shep?
- Nothing.

1205
01:13:16,366 --> 01:13:19,392
He left. He told me
he couldn't handle you anymore.

1206
01:13:19,436 --> 01:13:22,064
- What did you say?
- We had a heart to heart.

1207
01:13:22,105 --> 01:13:24,073
It was needed.

1208
01:13:24,107 --> 01:13:27,133
# Betty Lou's
getting out tonight#

1209
01:13:27,177 --> 01:13:29,668
# Betty Lou's getting
out tonight #

1210
01:13:29,713 --> 01:13:32,181
# Betty Lou's
getting out tonight #

1211
01:13:32,215 --> 01:13:35,378
- Dance with me.
- # She was bad, her mama got mad #

1212
01:13:35,419 --> 01:13:38,183
# But her mama
said it's all right #

1213
01:13:38,221 --> 01:13:41,088
# All the boys are getting
ready and right #

1214
01:13:41,124 --> 01:13:43,922
# Betty Lou's
getting out tonight #

1215
01:13:45,829 --> 01:13:47,797
# Betty Lou #

1216
01:13:47,831 --> 01:13:49,822
# Betty Lou #

1217
01:13:51,268 --> 01:13:54,101
# It's all true #

1218
01:13:54,137 --> 01:13:56,935
# It's really true #

1219
01:13:56,974 --> 01:13:58,942
# Well what do you
think about that, boys? #

1220
01:13:58,976 --> 01:14:00,967
# Come on #

1221
01:14:34,344 --> 01:14:36,539
Mmm, no.

1222
01:14:36,580 --> 01:14:40,072
Yes? What?

1223
01:14:40,117 --> 01:14:42,813
Emily, what's up?

1224
01:14:46,757 --> 01:14:48,588
Hold... hold on.
Hold on.

1225
01:14:50,027 --> 01:14:51,995
It's... it's Emily.
She's in the hospital.

1226
01:14:52,029 --> 01:14:54,395
What? Baby?

1227
01:14:54,431 --> 01:14:56,399
- I should go with you.
- No.

1228
01:14:56,433 --> 01:14:58,424
- I should go with you, Terry.
- No.

1229
01:14:59,903 --> 01:15:01,871
That's a long drive
this time of night.

1230
01:15:01,905 --> 01:15:04,499
Oh, no. I need you to stay here
in case Popeye wakes up.

1231
01:15:04,541 --> 01:15:06,509
I don't want her
to be scared, okay?

1232
01:15:06,543 --> 01:15:09,341
I'll be fine.

1233
01:15:12,716 --> 01:15:16,948
# Can I help it
if I'm bolder? #

1234
01:15:18,288 --> 01:15:21,018
# Can I help it
if I'm faithful? #

1235
01:15:21,058 --> 01:15:23,026
At this point,
I can't say much.

1236
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:25,028
Could be an ulcer,

1237
01:15:25,062 --> 01:15:27,030
could be pancreatic.

1238
01:15:27,064 --> 01:15:29,828
I don't know.
I'm at a loss for tonight.

1239
01:15:29,866 --> 01:15:31,834
What?
You're at a loss?

1240
01:15:31,868 --> 01:15:34,769
She's in a lot of pain.
I had to put her out and let her sleep.

1241
01:15:34,805 --> 01:15:36,796
I can't do anything
until the morning.

1242
01:15:38,008 --> 01:15:39,976
Well, what are you
gonna do in the morning?

1243
01:15:40,010 --> 01:15:41,978
Actually, I won't be here
in the morning.

1244
01:15:42,012 --> 01:15:43,980
I'm at the end
of a long shift,

1245
01:15:44,014 --> 01:15:46,812
but tests will be taken and tomorrow
night, when I come back

1246
01:15:46,850 --> 01:15:49,318
- I'll look at them and we'll talk.
- Tomorrow night?

1247
01:15:49,352 --> 01:15:51,320
Yes.

1248
01:15:51,354 --> 01:15:53,447
And what if I want
a second opinion?

1249
01:15:54,658 --> 01:15:56,717
Well, I haven't given you
a first one yet.

1250
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:59,729
And if I want
a second opinion?

1251
01:15:59,763 --> 01:16:02,061
It's 4:30 am.

1252
01:16:02,099 --> 01:16:04,329
I don't think you're going to get
a strong one.

1253
01:16:35,499 --> 01:16:38,297
Well, why would they
do something like that?

1254
01:16:38,335 --> 01:16:40,963
Because I didn't give
them candy, that's why.

1255
01:16:41,004 --> 01:16:44,701
Great. You're standing at the door
with a bowl of candy, why can't you...

1256
01:16:44,741 --> 01:16:46,709
Because I don't accept
15-year-old-girls

1257
01:16:46,743 --> 01:16:49,473
with no costume on.
If you don't have a costume on,

1258
01:16:49,513 --> 01:16:51,538
- you shouldn't be allowed...
- Who cares?!

1259
01:16:51,581 --> 01:16:53,606
They're just using
Halloween to get candy!

1260
01:16:53,650 --> 01:16:56,050
Who cares?! It's Halloween!
Just give them candy!

1261
01:16:56,086 --> 01:16:58,816
It's okay to use a holiday for your
own selfish purposes?!

1262
01:16:58,855 --> 01:17:00,482
Oh, so what?!

1263
01:17:00,524 --> 01:17:03,220
So you'd rather just have them
toiletpaper your house?

1264
01:17:03,260 --> 01:17:05,785
Well, I didn't know it was gonna
be "felony or treat!"

1265
01:17:05,829 --> 01:17:07,956
I don't... I didn't think that
trick extended to felony!

1266
01:17:07,998 --> 01:17:09,966
Why would it kill you just to give
'em a few pieces of candy?!

1267
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,298
- I don't understand that!
- Because there's gotta be

1268
01:17:12,335 --> 01:17:14,860
some kind of cut-off!
Shouldn't there be for Halloween?

1269
01:17:14,905 --> 01:17:16,873
Bob, what is with you
and your cut-offs

1270
01:17:16,907 --> 01:17:19,842
and your shouldn't there be
and should there be... who cares?!

1271
01:17:20,844 --> 01:17:22,903
She's really sick.

1272
01:17:22,946 --> 01:17:26,006
And the worst thing
is they don't know what it is.

1273
01:17:26,049 --> 01:17:29,280
I mean, it could be
an ulcer, it could be thyroid.

1274
01:17:29,319 --> 01:17:30,843
It, uh...

1275
01:17:30,887 --> 01:17:32,855
She can't eat and...

1276
01:17:32,889 --> 01:17:34,857
you know,
it could be cancer.

1277
01:17:34,891 --> 01:17:38,122
It could be...
it could be so many things.

1278
01:17:38,161 --> 01:17:40,652
I don't know
what it is.

1279
01:17:47,304 --> 01:17:49,295
I don't know what it is.

1280
01:17:54,444 --> 01:17:56,674
Oh God.

1281
01:18:21,671 --> 01:18:23,639
Directory assistance.

1282
01:18:23,673 --> 01:18:26,301
Um, yes, operator.
I would like, um,

1283
01:18:26,343 --> 01:18:29,312
I'm looking for directory assistance
for Karlstad, Sweden.

1284
01:18:29,346 --> 01:18:32,281
You said
"Karlstad, Sweden?"

1285
01:18:32,315 --> 01:18:34,306
Yes, thank you.

1286
01:18:40,824 --> 01:18:42,815
Look at you
all alone in here.

1287
01:18:44,394 --> 01:18:46,385
I like it like this.

1288
01:18:50,133 --> 01:18:52,124
Did you call Daddy
to tell him?

1289
01:18:53,937 --> 01:18:55,905
Um...

1290
01:18:55,939 --> 01:18:57,930
No, I didn't.

1291
01:19:07,117 --> 01:19:09,085
I don't hate him.

1292
01:19:09,119 --> 01:19:11,087
I mean, you know,
I know that you do,

1293
01:19:11,121 --> 01:19:13,089
but I've, uh, been
thinking about it,

1294
01:19:13,123 --> 01:19:15,114
and I just don't.

1295
01:19:27,304 --> 01:19:30,102
- Did you talk to the doctor?
- Yes.

1296
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:32,108
Did he tell you
it wasn't cancer?

1297
01:19:32,142 --> 01:19:34,940
Yes, he did.
Thank God.

1298
01:19:34,978 --> 01:19:37,572
He thinks that whatever it is
might be stress-related.

1299
01:19:39,182 --> 01:19:41,150
An ulcer, maybe.

1300
01:19:41,184 --> 01:19:44,745
He's very worried that you're under
too much stress, Emily.

1301
01:19:44,788 --> 01:19:47,348
- I'm not stressed.
- Yes, you are.

1302
01:19:47,390 --> 01:19:49,358
You are.
You're mad.

1303
01:19:49,392 --> 01:19:51,860
Mad at me.
Mad at Daddy.

1304
01:19:51,895 --> 01:19:54,625
I can see that
all the time.

1305
01:19:54,664 --> 01:19:56,495
You've got a cloud
over your head.

1306
01:19:56,533 --> 01:19:58,501
We need to get it
to go away.

1307
01:19:58,535 --> 01:20:01,470
Give you some air.

1308
01:20:01,504 --> 01:20:03,495
The doctor's
very worried, Emily.

1309
01:20:06,409 --> 01:20:08,343
- Maybe yoga.
- Stop it.

1310
01:20:08,378 --> 01:20:10,209
- I'm serious.
- Well, so am I.

1311
01:20:10,246 --> 01:20:12,510
You can't dance or exercise
your way out of this.

1312
01:20:14,117 --> 01:20:16,108
You need
to get better, Emily.

1313
01:20:17,287 --> 01:20:19,255
I can take a lot,

1314
01:20:19,289 --> 01:20:21,621
but I couldn't take
losing you.

1315
01:20:29,265 --> 01:20:31,256
Why is that funny?

1316
01:20:33,803 --> 01:20:37,170
Because you just don't seem
to care all that much about me,

1317
01:20:37,207 --> 01:20:39,175
unless, like now,
I'm sick.

1318
01:20:39,209 --> 01:20:41,177
That's not true.
That's just not true.

1319
01:20:41,211 --> 01:20:43,076
I adore you.

1320
01:20:44,714 --> 01:20:47,046
- You do?
- I do!

1321
01:20:48,251 --> 01:20:50,242
I don't see that.

1322
01:20:52,288 --> 01:20:54,256
Well, what can I say?

1323
01:20:54,290 --> 01:20:56,019
You're like everybody else
in my life

1324
01:20:56,059 --> 01:20:58,493
you need to pay
closer attention to me.

1325
01:21:03,433 --> 01:21:05,628
Okay.

1326
01:21:09,139 --> 01:21:11,107
How's the wind, Dad?

1327
01:21:11,141 --> 01:21:14,235
Fantastic!
Whoa! Yeah!

1328
01:21:14,277 --> 01:21:16,268
Far out!

1329
01:21:22,952 --> 01:21:25,443
Woo!

1330
01:21:30,994 --> 01:21:33,554
The only thing
I understand about this...

1331
01:21:34,898 --> 01:21:36,866
is the screaming.

1332
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:39,892
Whoo! Hey, hey!

1333
01:21:41,638 --> 01:21:43,606
So, how does
this work now?

1334
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:46,666
- You going next, Gorden?
- Hell no. He won't jump.

1335
01:21:46,709 --> 01:21:49,200
He's too scared.
He's a watcher.

1336
01:21:53,082 --> 01:21:55,312
- You're not gonna jump?
- No, he won't jump.

1337
01:21:55,351 --> 01:21:58,081
I'll go again,
unless you wanna take a shot.

1338
01:21:59,622 --> 01:22:01,590
Nope. Not me.

1339
01:22:01,624 --> 01:22:03,956
I'm a watcher too.

1340
01:22:16,206 --> 01:22:18,197
Are you gonna marry
my mother?

1341
01:22:23,346 --> 01:22:25,314
I don't know.
It's, um...

1342
01:22:25,348 --> 01:22:27,976
it's tough.
Your mom, she's...

1343
01:22:28,985 --> 01:22:30,953
she's tricky.

1344
01:22:30,987 --> 01:22:32,955
She didn't
used to be.

1345
01:22:32,989 --> 01:22:35,685
Ask anyone.
She was always sweet.

1346
01:22:38,027 --> 01:22:40,154
You should
marry her, Denny.

1347
01:22:40,196 --> 01:22:43,359
Would that make you happy?

1348
01:22:43,399 --> 01:22:45,390
It would, yeah.

1349
01:22:51,574 --> 01:22:53,542
Mmn.

1350
01:22:53,576 --> 01:22:55,510
So, uh...

1351
01:22:55,545 --> 01:22:57,513
your daughter
asked me

1352
01:22:57,547 --> 01:23:00,311
if I was going
to marry you, today.

1353
01:23:00,350 --> 01:23:03,080
Oh, please.
That's a cheap shot.

1354
01:23:09,092 --> 01:23:11,060
What do you mean?
She's, um...

1355
01:23:11,094 --> 01:23:13,062
she's adorable.

1356
01:23:13,096 --> 01:23:15,087
I know she is.

1357
01:23:23,339 --> 01:23:25,307
It wasn't
a cheap shot, Terry.

1358
01:23:25,341 --> 01:23:27,309
What?

1359
01:23:27,343 --> 01:23:29,334
Bringing up what...

1360
01:23:31,681 --> 01:23:34,149
bringing up what Popeye said.
It wasn't, um...

1361
01:23:34,183 --> 01:23:36,174
it wasn't a cheap shot.

1362
01:23:37,587 --> 01:23:39,555
I have enough problems
right now, Denny.

1363
01:23:39,589 --> 01:23:41,682
I don't need you
using my daughter as a pawn.

1364
01:23:46,963 --> 01:23:48,954
What are you
talking about?

1365
01:23:52,569 --> 01:23:54,730
I have a child incredibly
ill in the hospital.

1366
01:23:54,771 --> 01:23:58,070
Another one's sleeping with a pervert
that you brought into her life,

1367
01:23:58,107 --> 01:24:00,075
so I don't want to get
into something silly

1368
01:24:00,109 --> 01:24:02,077
like a cute talk
about a marriage

1369
01:24:02,111 --> 01:24:04,341
that we both know
would be doomed from the start,

1370
01:24:04,380 --> 01:24:06,405
so you know what
I'm talking about. Don't.

1371
01:24:06,449 --> 01:24:08,440
I don't wanna hear
what Popeye said, no.

1372
01:24:28,738 --> 01:24:31,639
I am so sick
of being your bitch.

1373
01:24:33,309 --> 01:24:36,642
I put up with your shit,
because I know how much pain you're in.

1374
01:24:36,679 --> 01:24:38,670
But it's enough!

1375
01:24:40,617 --> 01:24:43,211
It's a tall order
for a patient motherfucker,

1376
01:24:43,252 --> 01:24:45,220
and I am the farthest
thing from that

1377
01:24:45,254 --> 01:24:47,245
that you're ever
gonna lay eyes on.

1378
01:25:02,338 --> 01:25:05,330
...tomorrow.
- Denny? Can I talk to you for a second?

1379
01:25:05,375 --> 01:25:08,503
Yeah, I-I-I can
do this tomorrow.

1380
01:25:14,717 --> 01:25:16,685
Bad news.
You ready?

1381
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:19,882
Management has
a bug up their ass.

1382
01:25:19,922 --> 01:25:21,890
Okay, they've been
getting a lot of calls.

1383
01:25:21,924 --> 01:25:23,892
I've been trying
to keep this from you,

1384
01:25:23,926 --> 01:25:25,917
but they want
to renegotiate.

1385
01:25:27,664 --> 01:25:29,962
Renegotiate what?

1386
01:25:29,999 --> 01:25:32,160
Come on,
you know what.

1387
01:25:32,201 --> 01:25:33,998
They want you
to talk baseball.

1388
01:25:34,037 --> 01:25:36,028
What?

1389
01:25:36,072 --> 01:25:38,939
Either that or they want
to take us off the air.

1390
01:25:40,943 --> 01:25:43,673
- Good gag.
- It's not a gag, Denny.

1391
01:25:43,713 --> 01:25:45,578
I wish it was a gag.
It's not a gag.

1392
01:25:45,615 --> 01:25:48,243
You either talk baseball,
or we go off the air next week.

1393
01:25:48,284 --> 01:25:50,650
- I don't wanna talk baseball.
- Big deal.

1394
01:25:50,687 --> 01:25:52,587
They didn't want to have a sports
talk show in the middle of a day

1395
01:25:52,622 --> 01:25:54,988
with an all-rock format,
but I talked them into it.

1396
01:25:55,024 --> 01:25:57,584
Guess what?
You're a baseball star.

1397
01:25:57,627 --> 01:26:01,358
That's what people want to hear
from you. Baseball talk.

1398
01:26:01,397 --> 01:26:04,298
Nobody wants to hear your cooking
and your stock tips, Denny.

1399
01:26:04,333 --> 01:26:06,324
I'm sorry,
but it's true.

1400
01:26:11,908 --> 01:26:14,308
Saturday. Baseball talk.
They may even promo it.

1401
01:26:17,814 --> 01:26:21,375
Okay, Arthur, you're on in 5, 4, 3, 2...
better yet, you're on. Go.

1402
01:26:21,417 --> 01:26:24,079
All right, 101 WRIF, Detroit's home
of rock 'n' roll...

1403
01:26:41,270 --> 01:26:44,034
You're not even
gonna talk to me?

1404
01:26:44,073 --> 01:26:45,904
Denny?

1405
01:26:45,942 --> 01:26:48,410
I called you
eight times today.

1406
01:26:48,444 --> 01:26:50,412
Denny.

1407
01:26:50,446 --> 01:26:52,414
Denny.

1408
01:26:52,448 --> 01:26:54,507
Hey, come on.

1409
01:26:55,518 --> 01:26:57,952
I was in a bad mood, okay?

1410
01:26:57,987 --> 01:26:59,887
Denny?

1411
01:26:59,922 --> 01:27:01,890
I want you
to talk to me.

1412
01:27:11,334 --> 01:27:13,302
So, I brought
baby pictures.

1413
01:27:13,803 --> 01:27:15,293
Oh, I wish you'd
brought him.

1414
01:27:15,338 --> 01:27:17,238
He's with the nanny,
we needed a night off.

1415
01:27:17,273 --> 01:27:20,071
So it's done? They're gonna build
a subdivision back there?

1416
01:27:20,109 --> 01:27:22,100
Yeah, next month,
they break ground.

1417
01:27:23,746 --> 01:27:25,714
It's gonna change
the view.

1418
01:27:25,748 --> 01:27:27,739
The view
could use changing.

1419
01:27:30,286 --> 01:27:32,652
She's coming, okay?
Big smiles...

1420
01:27:32,688 --> 01:27:34,656
and compliments,
but normal though.

1421
01:27:34,690 --> 01:27:36,658
Everything's normal,
she looks great,

1422
01:27:36,692 --> 01:27:39,320
you're great.
Everything's calm.

1423
01:27:39,362 --> 01:27:42,160
- Calm and great.
- Yes, all of us.

1424
01:27:42,198 --> 01:27:44,325
Why don't you just put
some valium in her soup?

1425
01:27:44,367 --> 01:27:46,335
Don't test me tonight,
Hadley, I mean it.

1426
01:27:46,369 --> 01:27:48,360
I want her calm.

1427
01:27:52,675 --> 01:27:54,643
- Hey you.
- Hey.

1428
01:27:54,677 --> 01:27:57,840
- Hi.
- Look at you. You look beautiful.

1429
01:27:57,880 --> 01:28:00,849
No, you really do.
You look fantastic.

1430
01:28:04,754 --> 01:28:06,745
What?

1431
01:28:09,492 --> 01:28:12,154
So... David and I
have some news.

1432
01:28:14,764 --> 01:28:17,460
- We're pregnant again.
- Jesus.

1433
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:20,833
Really? Wow.

1434
01:28:29,111 --> 01:28:31,944
You... are...

1435
01:28:35,885 --> 01:28:38,410
Well, you... you don't
look stressed out to me.

1436
01:28:38,454 --> 01:28:40,752
What do you know?
You're a child.

1437
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:20,256
Wh... what do you mean you want
to end it? You're dumping me?

1438
01:29:20,296 --> 01:29:23,129
No, not really.

1439
01:29:23,165 --> 01:29:25,895
I just...
want us to move on...

1440
01:29:25,935 --> 01:29:28,995
- see other people.
- And continue seeing each other?

1441
01:29:31,107 --> 01:29:33,735
No, probably not.

1442
01:29:33,776 --> 01:29:36,142
So, you don't want
to sleep together anymore?

1443
01:29:36,178 --> 01:29:38,942
I mean, did I do something wrong,
'cause we were doing great.

1444
01:29:38,981 --> 01:29:40,676
I can't believe
we're hearing this.

1445
01:29:40,716 --> 01:29:43,310
Hey, don't turn around, man.
Just pretend we're in a meeting, okay.

1446
01:29:43,352 --> 01:29:45,320
Is this because
your mother detests me?

1447
01:29:45,354 --> 01:29:47,549
'Cause that's not a big deal.
A lot of people do.

1448
01:29:47,590 --> 01:29:50,616
I-I-I wouldn't have the things
that I have in my life

1449
01:29:50,660 --> 01:29:53,493
if people detesting me
was a big deal, 'cause it isn't.

1450
01:29:53,529 --> 01:29:55,554
It's not about my mother,
Shep, It's me.

1451
01:29:55,598 --> 01:29:57,828
Is it 'cause I've been
falling asleep lately?

1452
01:29:59,101 --> 01:30:01,331
Been, y-y-you know, quick,
whatever you're saying?

1453
01:30:01,370 --> 01:30:04,601
'Cause I'm tired,
but basically the sex is good, right?

1454
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:07,404
I don't know.
Yeah, I guess.

1455
01:30:07,443 --> 01:30:09,411
You guess?

1456
01:30:09,445 --> 01:30:12,278
You make a lot of noise
and a lot of very odd sounds

1457
01:30:12,315 --> 01:30:14,306
for someone that guesses.

1458
01:30:15,418 --> 01:30:17,886
I guess I've just gotten
good at faking it.

1459
01:30:22,658 --> 01:30:24,285
I'm sorry.

1460
01:30:24,327 --> 01:30:27,728
Okay, look, I just
want to move on with my life.

1461
01:30:28,798 --> 01:30:30,789
I'm sorry.

1462
01:30:32,768 --> 01:30:35,430
Don't be sorry.
Don't be sorry.

1463
01:30:35,471 --> 01:30:37,871
You know what?

1464
01:30:37,907 --> 01:30:40,273
It was inevitable.
Don't be sorry.

1465
01:30:40,309 --> 01:30:42,436
You're right.
It was bound to happen.

1466
01:30:42,478 --> 01:30:45,675
- Right?
- Yeah, I guess so.

1467
01:30:45,715 --> 01:30:47,683
Okay.

1468
01:30:47,717 --> 01:30:49,685
We gonna be able to
work together?

1469
01:30:49,719 --> 01:30:52,779
I mean... me producing
morning drive and you in the afternoons?

1470
01:30:56,459 --> 01:30:58,256
Yeah. Yeah,
it's gonna be fine.

1471
01:30:58,294 --> 01:31:00,091
- Okay.
- It's gonna be fine. It doesn't matter

1472
01:31:00,129 --> 01:31:02,290
'cause you're not gonna
be here that much longer anyway.

1473
01:31:02,331 --> 01:31:05,528
- What?
- This place is too small-time for you.

1474
01:31:05,568 --> 01:31:07,365
You're gonna be
long gone, real soon.

1475
01:31:07,403 --> 01:31:10,964
Now he's kissing
her ass, now?

1476
01:31:11,007 --> 01:31:12,975
Okay, I gotta get
back to work.

1477
01:31:13,009 --> 01:31:15,978
- All right? Okay.
- Go, go, go.

1478
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:53,678
- Hello?
- Hey, come to the window.

1479
01:31:53,716 --> 01:31:55,684
What?

1480
01:31:55,718 --> 01:31:57,709
Come to the window.

1481
01:32:02,925 --> 01:32:05,223
I'm not a liar.

1482
01:32:05,261 --> 01:32:06,990
I really do bungee jump.

1483
01:32:10,099 --> 01:32:12,090
You are so stoned.

1484
01:32:13,202 --> 01:32:15,193
Yeah, I know.

1485
01:32:17,940 --> 01:32:19,908
Whoa!

1486
01:32:19,942 --> 01:32:21,773
Whoa!

1487
01:32:21,811 --> 01:32:24,245
Oh!

1488
01:32:24,280 --> 01:32:26,271
Gorden, shh.

1489
01:32:27,616 --> 01:32:29,743
Oh! Hold it.

1490
01:32:29,785 --> 01:32:31,514
Whoa! Whoa!

1491
01:33:33,849 --> 01:33:36,317
Don't worry about that.
Go to the back and start working.

1492
01:33:36,352 --> 01:33:38,377
All right, all right,
I got it.

1493
01:34:07,816 --> 01:34:10,512
Oh, hey.

1494
01:34:10,553 --> 01:34:12,544
Hello, Shep.
How are you?

1495
01:34:13,722 --> 01:34:15,713
I'm doin' good.
How are you?

1496
01:34:17,826 --> 01:34:20,488
- You and Denny still not talkin'?
- No.

1497
01:34:20,529 --> 01:34:22,759
No, it's been awhile.
You know, it's been hard.

1498
01:34:23,866 --> 01:34:25,834
You know...

1499
01:34:25,868 --> 01:34:28,336
I'm not as bad as you
have me painted out to be, Terry.

1500
01:34:28,370 --> 01:34:30,338
Just so you know.
I promised myself

1501
01:34:30,372 --> 01:34:32,363
if I ever ran into you,
I would say that.

1502
01:34:33,676 --> 01:34:35,667
So there, I said it.

1503
01:34:37,646 --> 01:34:40,046
I should come over
some night with a bottle,

1504
01:34:40,082 --> 01:34:41,913
and you and I
should sit and talk.

1505
01:34:41,951 --> 01:34:44,351
- God...
- What?

1506
01:34:44,386 --> 01:34:47,116
What? You gave me that whole lecture
at Hadley's wedding.

1507
01:34:47,156 --> 01:34:50,387
- What lecture?
- About sleeping with women my own age.

1508
01:34:52,061 --> 01:34:54,689
You know, I'd love to sit
with you and talk to you

1509
01:34:54,730 --> 01:34:56,698
and give you my side
of that story.

1510
01:34:56,732 --> 01:34:58,996
You know, without
getting slapped around.

1511
01:34:59,034 --> 01:35:01,332
Oh, so you wanna come over
and sleep with me?

1512
01:35:01,370 --> 01:35:04,362
- Is that it, Shep?
- No, I didn't say that.

1513
01:35:04,406 --> 01:35:06,203
I said I'd like to have
a drink with you.

1514
01:35:06,242 --> 01:35:08,233
Hey, I'm not
drinking, okay?

1515
01:35:10,346 --> 01:35:12,314
Good, then we'll hang!

1516
01:35:12,348 --> 01:35:13,975
We'll hang...

1517
01:35:14,016 --> 01:35:16,416
or talk about you and Denny.
I mean, this is silly,

1518
01:35:16,452 --> 01:35:18,647
- you guys should be talking.
- It's silly, huh?

1519
01:35:18,687 --> 01:35:21,053
So you wanna tell me
how to live my life? Is that it?

1520
01:35:21,090 --> 01:35:23,650
Oh, God. Shep, you know, you were doing
better when you just wanted to screw me.

1521
01:35:23,692 --> 01:35:26,490
- What was that?!
- Hey...

1522
01:35:26,528 --> 01:35:28,496
you are a piece
of work. I gotta shop.

1523
01:35:28,530 --> 01:35:31,090
- Move back.
- Go.

1524
01:35:31,133 --> 01:35:33,101
Go.

1525
01:35:33,135 --> 01:35:35,126
- Go.
- Shep!

1526
01:35:39,908 --> 01:35:42,604
Oh, Jeez!

1527
01:35:42,645 --> 01:35:44,875
Just for the record,
I never wanted to screw you!

1528
01:35:44,913 --> 01:35:46,904
Got it, got it.

1529
01:35:56,792 --> 01:35:59,522
Heavens to Murgatroids.
It's Denny Davies.

1530
01:35:59,561 --> 01:36:02,029
That promo's on disk two,
loaded and ready to go, Art.

1531
01:36:02,064 --> 01:36:04,726
You hit on Terry?

1532
01:36:04,767 --> 01:36:07,497
- What?
- You hit on Terry in a grocery store?

1533
01:36:09,071 --> 01:36:10,868
You guys are talking now.
That's good.

1534
01:36:10,906 --> 01:36:13,534
We are now. We're talking about
what an asshole you are.

1535
01:36:13,575 --> 01:36:16,135
Come on. I was talking
about something very innocent.

1536
01:36:16,178 --> 01:36:18,146
I was gonna pay
a little social call.

1537
01:36:18,180 --> 01:36:20,648
No, you wanted
to go over there with a bottle of wine.

1538
01:36:20,683 --> 01:36:23,345
You wanted to...
you wanted to screw her.

1539
01:36:23,385 --> 01:36:25,353
Screw her?

1540
01:36:25,387 --> 01:36:27,446
No, I didn't.

1541
01:36:27,489 --> 01:36:29,889
I wa... I was talking
about something very innocent.

1542
01:36:29,925 --> 01:36:31,893
Right out of "Gunsmoke."

1543
01:36:31,927 --> 01:36:33,895
This is the problem
with being a deviant,

1544
01:36:33,929 --> 01:36:35,829
everyone sees you
as so one-dimensional.

1545
01:36:35,864 --> 01:36:38,458
Don't... no, don't do your rap on me.
I know you.

1546
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:39,967
You were hitting
on her.

1547
01:36:40,002 --> 01:36:42,470
I wasn't hitting on her, Den.
You're over-reacting.

1548
01:36:42,504 --> 01:36:44,404
Yeah, you were
and I'll tell you something else.

1549
01:36:44,440 --> 01:36:46,169
The whole Andy thing?
That was wrong.

1550
01:36:46,208 --> 01:36:48,176
It should have
never happened.

1551
01:36:48,210 --> 01:36:51,077
You had no business
being with her daughter.

1552
01:36:51,113 --> 01:36:53,809
I should've
said something. l...

1553
01:36:53,849 --> 01:36:55,840
- Go, Art.
- I don't know why I didn't.

1554
01:36:58,020 --> 01:36:59,988
Terry's right
to despise you.

1555
01:37:00,022 --> 01:37:01,580
She's right
to despise me?

1556
01:37:01,623 --> 01:37:03,750
What are you, a victim
of Stockholm Syndrome?

1557
01:37:03,792 --> 01:37:05,657
Come on. This is me.
Don't do this.

1558
01:37:05,694 --> 01:37:07,662
I knocked off
a great piece of ass...

1559
01:37:07,696 --> 01:37:10,358
What the fuck
are you doing?!

1560
01:37:10,399 --> 01:37:13,061
Shep, stop it!
Just stop it.

1561
01:37:25,314 --> 01:37:27,282
Okay, Arthur,
do your list...

1562
01:37:27,316 --> 01:37:31,116
and your promo and the give-away
Go right into the give-away.

1563
01:37:31,153 --> 01:37:34,384
You know what, Denny?
Everybody won here.

1564
01:37:34,423 --> 01:37:37,620
Okay? She went from being
a production assistant

1565
01:37:37,659 --> 01:37:40,628
to a producer in record time,
so you do the math.

1566
01:37:45,401 --> 01:37:47,369
I'll talk baseball.
I will...

1567
01:37:47,403 --> 01:37:50,804
but I don't want you producing
my show anymore, Shep.

1568
01:37:50,839 --> 01:37:53,205
I'm done with you.
I mean, I'll say what they want,

1569
01:37:53,242 --> 01:37:55,210
but you're off
of my show.

1570
01:37:55,244 --> 01:37:56,802
Now you want
to tell them

1571
01:37:56,845 --> 01:37:58,813
or should I?

1572
01:38:06,054 --> 01:38:08,045
Sorry, Arthur.

1573
01:38:13,762 --> 01:38:15,753
It's not your year,
is it, Sparky?

1574
01:38:37,519 --> 01:38:39,885
- Do you want me to dry your back?
- Jesus!

1575
01:38:39,922 --> 01:38:41,583
Oh, you scared
the hell out of me.

1576
01:38:42,591 --> 01:38:44,559
Oh!

1577
01:38:44,593 --> 01:38:47,357
You have no boundaries.

1578
01:38:50,866 --> 01:38:52,857
You have quite an ass,
know that?

1579
01:38:54,503 --> 01:38:56,471
What are you doing?

1580
01:38:57,473 --> 01:38:59,441
Have a drink?

1581
01:38:59,475 --> 01:39:02,035
No thanks.

1582
01:39:02,077 --> 01:39:04,705
Just, um... I'm not
drinking right now.

1583
01:39:26,635 --> 01:39:28,626
Do you want
to stay for dinner?

1584
01:39:30,372 --> 01:39:32,738
What do you think?

1585
01:39:34,209 --> 01:39:36,973
I didn't just come over
to see you naked.

1586
01:39:37,012 --> 01:39:39,003
You know,
been there, done that.

1587
01:39:45,454 --> 01:39:47,445
Gonna be late,
ladies!

1588
01:39:54,563 --> 01:39:56,554
Let's move!

1589
01:40:06,975 --> 01:40:08,943
Thanks for going
to this.

1590
01:40:08,977 --> 01:40:11,309
Oh, I know it means
a lot to you.

1591
01:40:14,082 --> 01:40:17,017
Mom, did you call him?
Did you ever call him?

1592
01:40:19,054 --> 01:40:21,045
No, I didn't.

1593
01:40:22,257 --> 01:40:24,225
And you know... you know,
I don't need to.

1594
01:40:24,259 --> 01:40:26,124
The doctor says
you're improving.

1595
01:40:27,829 --> 01:40:30,389
You're not wiggin' out
about this, are you? Stressing out?

1596
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:33,568
Jeez.

1597
01:40:33,602 --> 01:40:35,570
Terry?

1598
01:40:35,604 --> 01:40:38,266
I don't mean to be the girl here,
but we're gonna be late.

1599
01:42:09,598 --> 01:42:12,192
People don't know
how to love.

1600
01:42:12,234 --> 01:42:14,794
They bite
rather than kiss,

1601
01:42:14,836 --> 01:42:17,964
and they slap
rather than stroke.

1602
01:42:20,876 --> 01:42:23,902
Maybe it's because they realize
how easy it is for love to go bad,

1603
01:42:23,945 --> 01:42:27,210
to become
suddenly impossible...

1604
01:42:27,249 --> 01:42:30,844
unworkable,
an exercise in futility.

1605
01:42:30,886 --> 01:42:33,787
So they avoid it
and seek solace in angst

1606
01:42:33,822 --> 01:42:35,790
and fear
and aggression,

1607
01:42:35,824 --> 01:42:38,019
which are always there
and readily available.

1608
01:42:38,060 --> 01:42:40,790
Or maybe sometimes...

1609
01:42:40,829 --> 01:42:42,797
they just don't have
all the facts.

1610
01:43:27,943 --> 01:43:29,934
In here?

1611
01:43:41,256 --> 01:43:43,247
Holy mother of shit.

1612
01:43:45,427 --> 01:43:47,292
What is it?

1613
01:43:47,329 --> 01:43:49,320
What is it?

1614
01:43:52,167 --> 01:43:54,158
What is it?

1615
01:44:04,246 --> 01:44:06,942
You'd better go back, okay?
Just...

1616
01:44:06,982 --> 01:44:09,348
- I'll be right there. Look... no, no.
- No, what is it?

1617
01:44:09,384 --> 01:44:11,375
We pulled this jacket up,
found a wallet.

1618
01:44:30,939 --> 01:44:32,736
Go back, Terry.
Look, I mean it, honey.

1619
01:44:32,774 --> 01:44:35,299
- I mean it. Go back, go back
- No, I don't wanna go back.

1620
01:44:35,343 --> 01:44:37,334
Terry, please.

1621
01:44:41,483 --> 01:44:43,144
- Give me the flashlight.
- Baby, no.

1622
01:44:43,185 --> 01:44:44,743
- No.
- Give it to me. Give it to me.

1623
01:44:44,786 --> 01:44:46,947
Give me the flashlight, Denny.
Give it to me!

1624
01:45:18,320 --> 01:45:20,288
It's an old water well.

1625
01:45:20,322 --> 01:45:22,313
All covered up.

1626
01:45:29,464 --> 01:45:31,432
He must have...

1627
01:45:31,466 --> 01:45:33,434
come out to walk
the property

1628
01:45:33,468 --> 01:45:35,459
and fallen through.

1629
01:46:26,254 --> 01:46:29,621
You guys sh-should
go call the police.

1630
01:46:54,683 --> 01:46:56,651
Oh my God.

1631
01:46:56,685 --> 01:46:58,676
Oh God.

1632
01:48:19,934 --> 01:48:21,902
...to honor...

1633
01:48:23,738 --> 01:48:25,706
...our sense of loss.

1634
01:48:25,740 --> 01:48:27,708
What is the price
we've paid?

1635
01:48:27,742 --> 01:48:29,733
What is the price
we've paid for...

1636
01:49:25,300 --> 01:49:28,565
Anger and resentment
can stop you in your tracks.

1637
01:49:31,072 --> 01:49:33,632
That's what I know now.

1638
01:49:33,675 --> 01:49:35,870
It needs nothing
to burn but the air and the life

1639
01:49:35,910 --> 01:49:37,901
that it swallows
and smothers.

1640
01:50:14,082 --> 01:50:16,516
- What? What?
- Okay.

1641
01:50:16,551 --> 01:50:18,075
Whoa!

1642
01:50:25,093 --> 01:50:27,061
It's real, though...

1643
01:50:27,095 --> 01:50:29,427
the fury,

1644
01:50:29,464 --> 01:50:32,558
even when it isn't.

1645
01:50:32,600 --> 01:50:34,568
It can change you...

1646
01:50:34,602 --> 01:50:36,695
turn you...

1647
01:50:36,738 --> 01:50:39,502
mold you and shape you
into someone you're not.

1648
01:50:42,610 --> 01:50:45,545
The only upside
to anger, then...

1649
01:50:45,580 --> 01:50:47,548
is the person you become...

1650
01:50:47,582 --> 01:50:49,573
Good job.

1651
01:50:51,085 --> 01:50:54,418
...hopefully someone
that wakes up one day

1652
01:50:54,455 --> 01:50:57,219
and realizes they're
not afraid of its journey,

1653
01:50:59,027 --> 01:51:01,894
someone that knows
that the truth is, at best,

1654
01:51:01,930 --> 01:51:03,898
a partially told story.

1655
01:51:03,932 --> 01:51:06,332
That anger,
like growth,

1656
01:51:06,367 --> 01:51:08,335
comes in spurts
and fits

1657
01:51:08,369 --> 01:51:10,234
and in its wake,

1658
01:51:10,271 --> 01:51:13,502
leaves a new chance
at acceptance

1659
01:51:13,541 --> 01:51:15,532
and the promise
of calm.

1660
01:51:18,813 --> 01:51:22,476
Then again,
what do I know?

1661
01:51:22,517 --> 01:51:24,485
I'm only a child.

1662
01:51:27,255 --> 01:51:30,691
# How many roads
you've traveled #

1663
01:51:33,294 --> 01:51:36,923
# How many dreams
you've chased #

1664
01:51:39,734 --> 01:51:43,363
# Across sand
and sky and gravel #

1665
01:51:44,672 --> 01:51:49,006
# Looking for one
safe place, yeah #

1666
01:51:49,043 --> 01:51:51,807
# Yeah, yeah #

1667
01:51:51,846 --> 01:51:55,680
# One safe place, yeah #

1668
01:51:55,717 --> 01:51:58,345
# Yeah, yeah #

1669
01:52:01,289 --> 01:52:04,315
# Will you make
a smoother landing #

1670
01:52:07,428 --> 01:52:10,659
# When you break
your fall from grace #

1671
01:52:14,035 --> 01:52:17,436
# Into the arms
of understanding #

1672
01:52:18,773 --> 01:52:22,937
# Looking for one
safe place? Yeah #

1673
01:52:22,977 --> 01:52:25,605
# Yeah, yeah #

1674
01:52:25,647 --> 01:52:29,447
# One safe place, yeah #

1675
01:52:29,484 --> 01:52:33,113
# Yeah, yeah #

1676
01:52:46,601 --> 01:52:49,798
# Whoa, life
is trial by fire #

1677
01:52:53,174 --> 01:52:56,405
# And love's
the sweetest taste #

1678
01:52:59,247 --> 01:53:02,876
# And I pray
it lifts us higher #

1679
01:53:04,419 --> 01:53:08,321
# To one safe place, yeah #

1680
01:53:08,356 --> 01:53:10,847
# Yeah, yeah #

1681
01:53:10,892 --> 01:53:14,623
# One safe place, yeah #

1682
01:53:14,662 --> 01:53:17,324
# Yeah, yeah #

1683
01:53:17,365 --> 01:53:21,301
# One safe place, yeah #

1684
01:53:21,336 --> 01:53:23,463
# Yeah, yeah #

1685
01:53:39,253 --> 01:53:42,711
# How many roads
we've traveled #

1686
01:53:45,760 --> 01:53:49,218
# How many dreams
we've chased #

1687
01:53:51,833 --> 01:53:55,291
# Across sand and sky
and gravel #

1688
01:53:56,738 --> 01:54:00,834
# Looking for one
safe place, yeah #

1689
01:54:00,875 --> 01:54:03,639
# Yeah, yeah #

1690
01:54:03,678 --> 01:54:07,205
# One safe place, yeah #

1691
01:54:07,248 --> 01:54:10,149

01:54:10,184 --> 01:54:13,984
# One safe place, yeah #

1693
01:54:14,021 --> 01:54:16,751
# Yeah, yeah. #
