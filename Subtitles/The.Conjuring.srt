00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,522
<i>It scares us
just thinking about it.</i>

3
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,762
<i>When you hear it, you're gonna
think we 're insane.</i>

4
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,611
<i>Try us. Please, from the start.</i>

5
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:38,886
It started out small, like a hand
or a leg was in a different position.

6
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,566
Then its head was looking up
instead of down.

7
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,769
And then one day, it was in
a completely different room.

8
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,490
It was moving around by itself.

9
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,804
Ever think maybe somebody had a key
to your apartment and was playing a trick?

10
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,644
That's exactly what we thought.

11
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,805
But never once did we find any
sign or evidence of intrusion.

12
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,725
And this all led you to believe
that the doll was possessed?

13
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,291
Yes.

14
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,161
Camilla got in touch with a medium. We
learned from her that a 7-year-old girl...

15
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,244
...named Annabelle Higgins
had died in this apartment.

16
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,121
She was lonely and took a liking
to my doll.

17
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,643
All she wanted was to be friends.

18
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,167
When we heard this,
we felt really sorry for her.

19
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,011
I mean, we're nurses, we help people.

20
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,486
So...

21
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,126
...we gave her permission
to move into the doll.

22
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,282
Wait, you did what?

23
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,081
She wanted to live with us
by inhabiting the doll.

24
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,446
We said yes.

25
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,001
But then things got worse.

26
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,371
God.

27
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,363
<i>When we came home,
she was sitting in the hallway.</i>

28
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,966
<i>But we had left her in the spare room.</i>

29
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,962
Debbie! Debbie, wait!

30
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,768
We are beyond terrified.

31
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,931
We don't know what's going on
or what to do. Can you help us?

32
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,525
Yes, we can.

33
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:05,010
Now, firstly, there's no such thing
as Annabelle, and there never was.

34
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,242
Ghosts don't possess such power.

35
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,051
I think what we have here is something
extremely manipulative.

36
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,168
It's something inhuman.

37
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,841
It was a big mistake
acknowledging this doll.

38
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,162
And through that,
the inhuman spirit tricked you.

39
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,091
You gave it permission
to infest your lives.

40
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,489
What's an inhuman spirit?

41
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,527
It's something that's never walked
the earth in human form.

42
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,809
It's something demonic.

43
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,768
So the doll was never possessed?

44
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,849
No, no, it was used as a conduit.

45
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,361
It was moved around to give
the impression of possession.

46
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,206
Demonic spirits don't possess things,
they possess people.

47
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,442
It wanted to get inside of you.

48
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,202
All right, that's good, Drew.
You can shut it down now.

49
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,041
Hit the lights.

50
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,168
So we got the church to
send a priest over...

51
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,402
...to bless the house and the occupants.

52
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,246
Whatever was oppressing that apartment
was no longer with them. Any questions?

53
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,407
Yes.

54
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,210
Where's the doll now?

55
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,124
Someplace safe.

56
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,562
- Yep.
- So, what are you guys?

57
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,569
I mean, what do people call you?

58
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,490
Uh, well, we've been called Demonologists.
That's one name for us.

59
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,364
Ghost hunters, paranormal researchers.

60
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,847
- Kooks.
- Ha-ha-ha.

61
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,445
Wackos.

62
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,764
But we prefer to be known simply
as Ed and Lorraine Warren.

63
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,845
Here we are.

64
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,448
Wow, hear that?

65
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,250
- I don't hear anything.
- Exactly.

66
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,640
Oh. Ha!

67
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,088
- Okay. Guys, we are here!
- Get out of the car.

68
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,129
Oh, God, we're in the middle of nowhere.

69
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,329
Are you so excited?
Where's my "yes"? Where's my "yes"? Yes!

70
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,601
I'll race you!

71
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,001
- Are you guys excited?
- Yes!

72
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,168
- I'm so excited!
- Come on, Sadie!

73
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,850
I get my own room!

74
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,685
Are you kidding me?
No dibs on the rooms!

75
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,966
- What?
- What?

76
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,846
So do I get to pick my own room?
Or do I have no choice in that either?

77
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,682
Well, first cute boy she meets,
she'll forget about Jersey.

78
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,126
- Great.
- I hope.

79
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,486
I can't wait.

80
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,360
Come on, Sadie.

81
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,885
Sadie, let's go.

82
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,484
Hey, come.

83
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,210
What's the matter with you?

84
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,124
Hey, come on, girl.

85
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,889
All right, suit yourself.

86
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,084
<i>- What's your name?
- What's your name?</i>

87
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,123
<i>- Who's your daddy?
- Who's your daddy?</i>

88
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,970
<i>- He rich?
- Is he rich like me?</i>

89
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,246
Watch your step.

90
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,845
Coming through.

91
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,727
Whoa, watch out, Dad.

92
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,760
- Where do you want it?
- In the living room.

93
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,880
- Andrea, where's my wind chime?
- I think Nancy's got it in the other room.

94
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,241
Thanks. Hey, Nancy,
have you seen my wind chime?

95
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,050
- Oh, this one?
- Yeah, thanks.

96
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,044
- You're gonna have to catch it.
- Nancy! Let go! Give it here.

97
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,090
You're so mean.

98
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,844
Hey, Mom, can I hang up
my wind chime?

99
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,401
Of course. There's a line outside
you can hang it on.

100
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,251
Honey, have April come in, okay?
It's gonna be dark soon.

101
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,686
Okay.

102
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,889
Come on, April! Mom wants us inside!

103
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,727
Look what I found, Cindy.

104
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,725
<i>One...</i>

105
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,287
...two...

106
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,566
...three.

107
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,609
Come on, come on, come on.
No peeking.

108
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,125
Four.

109
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,449
Are you guys done with the pizza?
I don't want it going to waste.

110
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,046
- Let's go.
- It's expensive feeding you girls.

111
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,602
Seven, eight, nine, ten.

112
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,921
Where should I hide?

113
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,282
Ready or not, here I come!

114
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,040
Okay, clap.

115
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,608
- Whoa!
- You don't know the house well enough.

116
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,841
Someone's gonna get hurt.

117
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,286
I'm okay, I'm okay.

118
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,571
Second clap.

119
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,091
That's cheating.

120
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,966
Clap.

121
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,885
- Got You!
- Aah!

122
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,528
- Are you okay? Um...
- Yeah.

123
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,565
All right, what did we break now?

124
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,722
- I didn't mean to.
- Move out of there, please.

125
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,644
It was Christine's fault.

126
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,041
- Oh, jeez.
- My fault? Oh, my God.

127
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,123
- Christine did it.
- No, I didn't.

128
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,442
- You pushed me.
- No, no, you fell back.

129
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,285
Hey, Nancy, can you go get me
the matches, please?

130
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,326
What's going on?

131
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,482
- Nancy broke something.
- Shut up.

132
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,523
- What broke?
- It's the Wall.

133
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,729
- Whoa.
- I think we have a cellar or something.

134
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,291
I wanna see, I wanna see.
Move, move, move.

135
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,566
Here, matches. Thank you.

136
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,764
- I wanna see.
- You can see.

137
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,684
- I wanna see.
- You can all see.

138
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,046
Move!

139
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,083
Oh, man.

140
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,887
Huh.

141
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,920
Roger?

142
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,366
What do you see down there?

143
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,050
Just, uh, hard to tell, you know?

144
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,166
It's an old piano
and a whole bunch of garbage.

145
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,727
Agh. Son of a...

146
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,964
Wow.

147
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,245
Rog?

148
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,011
Come on up.

149
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,969
I don't want you girls going down there.

150
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,849
- That place is loaded with spiders.
- Ew!

151
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,087
Just relax. Okay.

152
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,561
Stop it, Nancy. It's not funny.

153
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,442
We've got extra square footage anyway.
I'll check it out in the morning.

154
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,802
- I wonder why it was boarded up.
- I don't know.

155
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,041
Okay, show's over.

156
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,889
- Five minutes.
- No more minutes.

157
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,407
- Up to bed. Please. Thank you.
- Right to bed.

158
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,931
Man, I'm fried.

159
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,484
Something's up with Sadie.

160
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,601
Yeah, I don't know what her problem is.
Couldn't get her to come inside.

161
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,564
We can't leave her out there.

162
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,882
She's all right.
I got her on a chain.

163
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,970
Sadie, hey, be quiet.

164
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,962
Thanks for making this work.

165
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,009
I know it was a lot to bite off.

166
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,320
It's gonna be great, isn't it?

167
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,763
I think it's great already.

168
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,121
Yeah.

169
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,004
You still too fried to christen
the new house?

170
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,450
Who said I'm fried?

171
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,004
- Ain't nobody here's fried.
- Ha, ha.

172
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,600
Mom?

173
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,207
Hey. How did you guys sleep?

174
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,561
I'm cold.

175
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,245
It is chilly, isn't it?

176
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,246
You think maybe we could have bought
a house with a toilet that actually works?

177
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,447
Tell your father.

178
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,729
And there was a funky smell in my
room last night. Like something died.

179
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,484
- Is it still there?
- No.

180
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,687
Problem solved.

181
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,561
Roger?

182
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,531
Roger?

183
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,445
Down here, honey.

184
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,647
Morning.

185
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,887
Ooh. Whoa.

186
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,731
This is gonna take some
serious elbow grease.

187
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,081
Yeah.

188
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,884
Oh, my God.

189
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,643
What are we gonna do
with all this stuff?

190
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,246
Well, we probably ought
to go through it, you know?

191
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,801
There might be some antiques down here
worth a lot.

192
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,645
Yeah, or just a lot of junk
the previous owner didn't want.

193
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,128
- It's ours now.
- Knock yourself out.

194
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,768
- I'm gonna make some coffee.
- Okay.

195
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,968
I'm gonna see if I can get
this furnace working.

196
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,929
Yeah, that'd be nice. It's freezing.

197
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,241
Yeah.

198
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,884
Hmm.

199
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,045
Sadie! Come here, Sadie!

200
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,646
Mommy!

201
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,285
Mommy, where's Sadie?

202
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,764
She's outside. You know, I'm sure she's hungry by now.
Why don't you go and get her.

203
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,807
- Whoa.
- Morning, Dad.

204
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,962
- Can you hold this?
- Sure.

205
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,804
- Sadie!
- Slow it down, Scoot.

206
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,246
- Roger.
- Yeah.

207
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,569
This clock stopped at 3:07,
and so did the one in the hallway.

208
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,131
That's weird.

209
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,809
Maybe it got knocked around in the move.

210
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,850
Speaking of knocked around,
what did you do to me last night?

211
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,765
- Ouch. I didn't do that. Did I?
- I don't know.

212
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,366
Sadie!

213
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,367
April! April!

214
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,126
What's...? April! What's going on?

215
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,601
- What happened?
- Oh, my God!

216
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,411
Oh, Sadie.

217
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,568
We keep everything locked in here.

218
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,764
Feel free to look around.

219
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,804
Just don't touch anything.

220
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,770
Wow.

221
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,530
This is crazy.

222
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,444
So all these are taken from cases
you've investigated?

223
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,571
That's right. Everything you see
in here is either haunted, cursed...

224
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,684
...or has been used in some kind
of ritualistic practice.

225
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,004
Nothing's a toy.

226
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,844
Not even the toy monkey.

227
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,725
Don't touch it.

228
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:49,403
Oh, ahem. Well, isn't it scary,
or doesn't it worry you...

229
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,847
...to have all these items
right in your home?

230
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,402
That's why we have a priest that comes by
once a month to bless the room.

231
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,766
Well, the way I see it is:

232
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,571
It's safer for these things
to be in here than out there.

233
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,529
It's kind of like keeping guns
off the street.

234
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,763
Why not just throw them
in an incinerator? Destroy them.

235
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,849
Well, that would only destroy the vessel.

236
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,170
Sometimes it's better to keep
the genie in the bottle.

237
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,205
Say, is the, uh, Annabelle doll here?

238
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,485
Right this way.

239
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,086
Yeah.

240
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,326
- You said she's a conduit?
- That's right.

241
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,686
What does that mean?

242
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,686
A very powerful demonic
has latched itself onto her.

243
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,810
So when you guys investigate
these hauntings...

244
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,201
...how do you stop them
from latching onto you?

245
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,930
We have to take great precaution.

246
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,724
But what about your wife?

247
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,965
What about her?

248
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,889
Well, Father Gordon told me that...

249
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,530
Well, that was different.

250
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,890
What happened to my wife
happened during an exorcism.

251
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,724
Well, what's the difference?

252
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,766
Excuse me.

253
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,800
Honey, what are you doing?

254
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,401
Come here.

255
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,921
You know better. All right?

256
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,525
Georgiana?

257
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,087
- Come on. Did you touch anything?
- No.

258
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,571
All right, come on, honey.

259
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,971
- Georgiana! Could you take Judy upstairs?
- Oh, sure.

260
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,600
You can't go into this room,
no matter what, remember?

261
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,205
- Yes, Daddy.
- All right.

262
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,281
- Go on.
- Okay, come on.

263
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,489
Let's see if I can find you
a little snack, okay? Come on.

264
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,802
Hey. What's going on in here?

265
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,440
- Daddy, look.
- You look very pretty.

266
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,967
All right, all done.
Go get dressed for dinner.

267
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,964
- I'm wearing it to dinner.
- No, you're not!

268
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,366
Here you go.

269
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,451
How'd it go?

270
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,728
Oh, I think he may write
a positive article.

271
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,803
Ooh, a non-skeptic.

272
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,686
That's a pleasant change.

273
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,001
Yeah.

274
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,644
Stop blaming yourself.

275
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,045
No sugar.

276
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,685
Be right back.

277
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,448
Not funny, Nancy.

278
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,840
What?

279
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,608
Stop grabbing my foot.

280
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,928
Shut up, I didn't do anything.

281
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,205
Yeah, right.

282
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,888
And stop farting.

283
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,129
It really stinks.

284
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:39,042
Don't blame that on me. It's you. Pew.

285
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,401
Dad?

286
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,602
Andrea, what are you doing out of bed?

287
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,046
What's that sound?

288
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,125
It's Cindy. She's in my room.
She's sleepwalking again.

289
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,688
I've never seen her do this before.

290
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,241
I remembered you saying not
to wake her if she's like this.

291
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,323
No, we just put her back to bed.

292
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,006
Hey, hey. Sweetie. Shh.

293
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,166
Let's go back to bed.

294
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,964
She's okay. Good night.

295
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,326
Night.

296
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,449
<i>She's sleepwalking again?
She hasn't done that for a while.</i>

297
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,203
She ended up in Andrea's room too.
I think kind of freaked her out.

298
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,966
- That's not good. What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

299
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,691
- Honey, you got another bruise here.
- Hmm?

300
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,291
Does that hurt?

301
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,366
That's weird.

302
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:22,484
I don't know. Will you do me a favor,
go see a doctor for that?

303
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,607
- Yeah, I will. Drive safe.
- Yeah.

304
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,489
- I love you.
- I love you too.

305
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,086
Bye!

306
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,730
Love you!

307
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,770
- Cindy, you have your lunch?
- Yeah.

308
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,402
Yes, I do.

309
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,403
I miss Sadie a lot.

310
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,927
She was my best friend.

311
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,009
You're my friend, right?

312
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,250
Yeah, let's play.

313
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,125
- Who are you talking to?
- Rory.

314
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,681
Rory?

315
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,082
- He's my new friend.
- Oh, really?

316
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,323
- Yeah, do you want to see him?
- Yeah. Uh-huh. How?

317
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,925
With this.

318
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:40,766
When the music stops, you see him
in the mirror standing behind you.

319
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,801
Okay.

320
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,883
But you have to twist the key.

321
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,246
Okay.

322
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,410
- Boo, Mommy! Ha-ha!
- Oh!

323
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,890
- April, you just gave me a heart attack.
- Got you!

324
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,923
Well, okay, I guess Rory
doesn't want to see me, huh?

325
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,320
Hmm. Oh, well.

326
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,164
Can we play hide-and-clap?

327
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,607
Hide-and-cla...?
Oh, honey, I don't want to play.

328
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:28,367
- Please! Nobody ever lets me play.
- Okay, okay.

329
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,328
Remember, you get to ask me
for three claps.

330
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,527
Okay.

331
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,889
One, two, three.

332
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,690
- I'm gonna go hide now!
- Okay.

333
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,525
Four, five...

334
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,570
...six, seven...

335
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,087
...eight, nine...

336
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,966
...ten!

337
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,165
First clap!

338
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,489
Ow. Shit.

339
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,165
Second clap!

340
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,047
April.

341
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,445
April.

342
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,685
Oh, I know where you're hiding.

343
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,962
Give me the third clap.

344
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,965
I'm gonna get you now.

345
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,049
I can hear you breathing.

346
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,051
April.

347
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,451
April.

348
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,447
Ha, ha. You took your blindfold off. I win!

349
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,486
You weren't even warm, Mom.
I was in Christine and Nancy's room.

350
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,806
<i>I gotta have some routes here,
or I'm gonna lose the insurance on the rig.</i>

351
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,491
That's like half of my rate, man.

352
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,162
Yeah, okay.

353
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,242
I'll, uh... Yeah, I'll take it.

354
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,686
Thank you.

355
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,370
- What's the route?
- It's, uh, Florida.

356
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,251
It's a week turnaround. I start tomorrow.

357
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,565
We'll get through this.

358
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,606
Yeah.

359
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,091
Come on, let's go to bed.

360
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:39,007
Stop it, Nancy. It's not funny anymore.

361
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,243
I'm trying to sleep,
please stop grabbing my feet.

362
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,045
Nancy?

363
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,610
Nancy?

364
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,729
What are you doing?

365
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,651
Christine?

366
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,441
Are you all right?

367
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,771
Do you see it?

368
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,766
See what?

369
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,322
There's someone behind the door.

370
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,720
What?

371
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,931
There's someone standing over there.

372
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,407
I don't see anyone.

373
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,161
It's looking right at us.

374
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,931
Nancy, don't! Nancy.

375
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,526
No, no. Look. Look.

376
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:31,162
Look, there's no one here. See?

377
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,805
Ugh. It's that smell again.

378
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,282
Oh, my God.

379
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,924
It's standing right behind you.

380
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,929
Christine?! Christine! Christine!

381
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,450
God, it won't op...

382
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,723
- Christine!
- No! No! No!

383
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,924
- What's going on? What happened?
- There was someone else in here!

384
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,127
- What?
- Where?

385
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,568
By the door.
It was behind the door.

386
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,286
Honey, there's nothing in here.
There's nobody in here.

387
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,249
There was someone else in here!

388
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:22,849
I was just sleeping, and then
I felt somebody grab my feet.

389
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,321
So I thought it was Nancy.

390
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,808
Well, honey, I'm pretty sure
that it was just a bad dream.

391
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,566
No! It talked to me!

392
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,649
It said...

393
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:37,881
...that it wants my family dead.

394
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,400
<i>Mr. Winston!</i>

395
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,564
Winston? Winston?

396
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,331
Get behind him.

397
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,167
Where you off to?

398
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,800
I just gotta run to the store
for a few things.

399
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,970
- Why do you even try?
- What? What do you mean?

400
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,691
In 15 years have you
ever been able to lie to me?

401
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,810
Father Gordon called. He's got
a case he wants us to look into.

402
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,531
I said I'd go check it out myself.
Lorraine, myself.

403
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,045
I'm going with you.

404
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,281
I know you're worried
it's gonna happen again.

405
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,249
Yeah, I am. I really am.

406
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:23,931
Maybe it's just time we take a break.
Write that book.

407
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,965
Do you remember what you said to me
on our wedding night?

408
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,970
"Can we do it again?"

409
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,001
After that.

410
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,240
You said that God brought us together
for a reason. Right?

411
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,370
I'm pretty sure it's not to write a book.

412
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,724
I'm gonna get dressed.

413
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,367
<i>We've isolated the
disturbances to the attic.</i>

414
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,881
<i>I want you to listen for a second.</i>

415
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,281
Oh, my God, that's it.

416
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,365
Do it again, Ed.

417
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,562
Right now it's just my weight. But you
take the water coming off the pipe...

418
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,291
...combined with the wind coming
through the broken window...

419
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,800
...these boards are gonna expand
and rub against each other.

420
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,726
You heard it all through the house because
of these pipes leading to the radiator.

421
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,843
So this place isn't haunted?

422
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,604
No, it rarely is.

423
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,566
Yeah, there's usually always
some kind of rational explanation.

424
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,451
Girls, it's way past your bedtime.

425
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,050
Who is that?

426
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,011
Who's ever down there,
I'm gonna lock you in now!

427
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,727
Aah! Unh.

428
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,810
Aah!

429
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,445
Help!

430
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,409
Andrea! Help!

431
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,526
<i>Hey, wanna play hide-and-clap?</i>

432
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,364
Aah!

433
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,400
Cindy?

434
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,043
Okay, now...

435
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,520
All right?

436
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,285
All right, come on.

437
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,880
Come on.

438
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,126
There you go.

439
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,088
Okay, you can just sleep with me tonight,
all right?

440
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,325
There you go.

441
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,881
There.

442
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,966
- Andrea?
- Help! Help! Help!

443
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,764
- Who's in here?
- Andrea!

444
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,127
Andrea? Andrea!

445
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,406
In here!

446
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,046
Help, Daddy! Help, it's Andrea!

447
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,645
- Who's in here?
- Andrea!

448
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,610
What happened?

449
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,206
Somebody, goddamn it,
tell me what's going on here?

450
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:22,281
<i>Fear is defined as a feeling of agitation
and anxiety caused by the presence...</i>

451
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,965
<i>...or imminence of danger.</i>

452
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:28,643
<i>Whether it's a ghost, a spirit
or an entity, they all feed on it.</i>

453
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,847
Take Maurice here.

454
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:33,203
A French-Canadian farmer with
no more than a third-grade education...

455
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,887
...yet after he was possessed, spoke
some of the best Latin I'd ever heard.

456
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,280
Sometimes backwards.

457
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:42,161
He'd been molested by his father,
who had also tortured him repeatedly.

458
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,807
A dark spirit made its home in this man.

459
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:50,409
Now, if you look into his eyes,
you can see him tearing blood.

460
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,405
And like that...

461
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:03,724
...an upside-down cross started
to appear from within his body.

462
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,682
All right, Drew, you
can hit the lights.

463
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,207
Oh.

464
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,727
Did you personally
perform the exorcism?

465
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,730
No, I'm not authorized.
But I've assisted on many.

466
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,843
See, an exorcism
can be very dangerous...

467
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,049
...not only for the victim,
but for anyone in the room.

468
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:24,160
- What happened to Maurice?
- He tried to kill his wife...

469
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,643
...but instead shot her in the arm
and then turned the gun on himself.

470
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:31,247
Maurice had a very troubled life
with little to live for...

471
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,290
...and not even an exorcist
could bring him back.

472
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:37,889
Which brings us to the three stages
of demonic activity:

473
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,281
Infestation, oppression and possession.

474
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,805
Now, infestation:

475
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:45,931
That's the whispering, the footsteps,
the feeling of another presence...

476
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:49,761
...which ultimately grows
into oppression, the second stage.

477
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,207
Now this is where the victim,
and it's usually the one...

478
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,249
...who's the most
psychologically vulnerable...

479
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,290
...is targeted specifically
by an external force.

480
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,887
Breaks the victim down.
Crushes their will.

481
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:06,291
And, once in a weakened state, leads them
to the third and final stage: possession.

482
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,010
- Hey, Ed? Lorraine?
- Yeah.

483
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,606
There's someone here
that would like to talk to you.

484
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,807
- Hi.
- Thanks, Drew.

485
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,450
- Thank you.
- I'll see you later.

486
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,681
How can we help you?

487
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:22,164
There's something horrible happening in
my house. Could you come and take a look?

488
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,283
You know, uh, it's getting kinda late.

489
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:27,205
- We really need to head to our family.
- You don't understand.

490
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:30,250
But we do. There's usually some
sort of rational explanation...

491
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:35,167
I have five daughters who are scared to death.
I'm so afraid this thing wants to hurt us.

492
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:39,166
You have a daughter. Wouldn't you do
anything you could to protect her? Please.

493
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,527
Please can you come and take a look?

494
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,246
Of course we will.

495
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,610
Of course we will.

496
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,682
<i>Come on, Jan! Open up!</i>

497
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,571
<i>Jan, what happened?</i>

498
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,524
<i>The top of your head turned black.</i>

499
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,444
You guys straighten up? Thanks.

500
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,409
<i>Don't be silly, it's a wig.</i>

501
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,691
- Hello. Hi.
- Hi. Hi.

502
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,251
Thanks for coming.

503
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:19,724
- Hi, I'm Roger.
- Lorraine.

504
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,207
Hey, nice to meet you, Roger. Ed Warren.

505
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,649
- Thanks for coming.
- Please, come in.

506
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,046
Thank you.

507
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:28,681
So...

508
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:31,844
Oh, my God. Look at you all.
Who are these beautiful young women?

509
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,368
This is Andrea, the oldest,
Nancy, Cindy, Christine...

510
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,130
...and April.

511
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,285
It's Mr. and Mrs. Warren.

512
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,565
- We're all sleeping down here now.
- Mm.

513
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,765
The girls feel safer and it's warmer.

514
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:50,647
I'm constantly turning up the heat,
but the house is always freezing.

515
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,723
It's not a problem with the furnace.

516
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,166
I mean, not that I can find.

517
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:03,166
It's gotten a lot
worse the past few nights.

518
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:09,050
There's this awful smell, like rotting meat.
It moves around the house.

519
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,081
Uh...

520
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,446
What? What is it?

521
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:20,530
Well, rancid smells could indicate
some type of demonic activity.

522
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:21,841
Oh, my God.

523
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,567
That's to keep those doors
from banging at night.

524
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,167
Otherwise, it's like:
All night long, just like that.

525
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,648
- Does it come in threes?
- Yeah.

526
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:36,961
It stops at dawn?

527
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:38,766
Uh-huh.

528
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:44,048
Well, sometimes it's meant
as an insult to the Trinity:

529
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,168
The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

530
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:51,487
You know, it's the damndest thing,
but we also get all kinds of birds...

531
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:54,650
...that will just fly against the side
of the house and break their necks.

532
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,450
Hm. Really?

533
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,041
And the clocks stop at 3:07 a.m.

534
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,282
- All of them?
- Every one.

535
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:07,444
Oh, we were hanging those
along the stairs.

536
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:11,889
Something just kept knocking them down,
so we stopped hanging them up.

537
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,607
That's what I was talking about.

538
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,684
It was here when we moved in.

539
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:22,047
There's also a lot of stuff in the cellar.

540
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,451
Show me the cellar.

541
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:41,166
<i>Look what she made me do.</i>

542
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,801
You picking up anything in here, hon?

543
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,285
Something awful happened here, Ed.

544
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:57,323
Those bruises, they from something
that happened here?

545
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:01,530
Oh, it's some iron deficiency thing I have.

546
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:07,081
You know, with all that's been going on,
why haven't you just moved out?

547
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,368
I don't know where
we'd move to, you know?

548
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:13,844
We got all our money tied up in this place
and had a lot of repairs on top of that.

549
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,485
And I don't know anybody whose gonna
take in a family of seven indefinitely.

550
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,569
That's why we tracked you down.

551
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,804
We're glad you found us.

552
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,601
All right, let's get started.

553
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:31,167
My name is Ed Warren.
It's November 1st, 1971.

554
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,362
I'm sitting here with Carolyn Perron...

555
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:37,730
...who, with her family, has been
experiencing supernatural occurrences.

556
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,130
Okay, go ahead.

557
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,051
Where do I start?

558
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,284
From the first occurrence.

559
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,368
I guess it was the clocks.

560
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,488
Mom and Dad tell me
that you have a friend.

561
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,881
His name's Rory.
He lives here too.

562
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,883
- Hmm.
- But he's always sad.

563
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,087
Why is that?

564
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:00,040
He won't tell me but I think
something bad happened to him.

565
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:05,001
Do you mind if I try to see Rory?

566
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:37,161
Hey.

567
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,206
What is it?

568
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:14,490
We bought it at auction from the bank, so,
you know, we never knew who lived here.

569
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:24,371
Well, Lorraine and I both feel that
what your house needs is a cleansing.

570
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:26,846
An exorcism.

571
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,885
What, exorcism?

572
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:34,810
I thought that was something
that you do to people.

573
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,365
No, not necessarily, no.

574
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,331
We have to get out of here.

575
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,482
I'm afraid that's not gonna help.

576
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,807
Lorraine saw something, which...

577
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,246
Go ahead, hon.

578
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:52,048
I've been seeing the dark entity
that haunts your house...

579
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:53,725
<i>...and your land.</i>

580
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,767
I saw it first when I came
through your door.

581
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,127
<i>It was latched to your back.</i>

582
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,690
<i>And then I saw it again with the girls
when we walked into the living room.</i>

583
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,887
And it doesn't matter where you go...

584
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:17,209
...this dark entity has latched itself
to your family...

585
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,885
...and it's feeding off you.

586
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,088
Even if we leave?

587
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,925
Sometimes when you get haunted,
it's like stepping on gum.

588
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,369
You take it with you.

589
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:33,523
Look, I gotta tell you,
you have a lot of spirits in here...

590
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:38,288
...but this is the one that I'm most
worried about, because it is so hateful.

591
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:42,010
Okay, so what do we do?
Can we call a priest?

592
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,491
I wish it were that easy.

593
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:47,645
Performing an exorcism is an archaic
procedure. Requires years of training.

594
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:52,570
And even then,
I have seen it go horribly wrong.

595
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:57,241
But before we even get that far,
the church has to authorize it first.

596
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,643
It means we gotta investigate,
gather evidence and provide proof...

597
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,330
...and that's the hard part.

598
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,209
Have your children been baptized?

599
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:10,684
Uh, no, we never got around to that.
We're not really a churchgoing family.

600
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:14,527
Well, you may want to rethink that.
Our presence here could make things worse.

601
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:15,806
Why?

602
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,325
Because we're a threat.

603
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,410
And whatever you're dealing with here
isn't gonna like us.

604
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:24,121
So far it hasn't done anything violent,
and that's a good sign.

605
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:27,210
So we're gonna have our guy
do some homework on the property...

606
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,169
...to see what we're up against.

607
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,209
<i>Judy, what are you up to?</i>

608
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:36,125
- I got you a present.
- Aah.

609
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:39,363
Me and Nanna got these
at the church's yard sale.

610
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,363
- Honey.
- One for you and one for me.

611
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,090
- Aw.
- She put a picture...

612
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:44,526
...of you and Daddy in mine.

613
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:48,203
Nanna said this way
we'll always be together.

614
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:50,886
You'll be with me and I'll be with you.

615
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:55,688
I miss you and Daddy.

616
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:07,446
Hey, hon.

617
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:10,727
Yup.

618
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,724
You're not gonna believe this.
Carolyn's voice didn't record.

619
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,127
What do you mean?

620
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,286
Listen.

621
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:22,247
<i>My name is Ed Warren.
It's November 1st, 1971.</i>

622
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,243
<i>I'm sitting here with Carolyn Perron...</i>

623
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,847
<i>...who, with her family, has been
experiencing supernatural occurrences.</i>

624
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,565
<i>Okay, go ahead.</i>

625
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,609
<i>From the first occurrence.</i>

626
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:39,486
Nothing.

627
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,241
The whole time.

628
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,966
- I don't know. You find anything?
- Lots.

629
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,570
I mean, it's no wonder they're
going through what they are.

630
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:49,763
That's the original farmhouse.

631
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:53,003
It was built in 1863 by a man
named Jedson Sherman...

632
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:55,766
...who was married to a woman
named Bathsheba.

633
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:59,203
Ed, she's related to Mary Towne Estye.

634
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,561
She was one of the women
accused of witchcraft in Salem.

635
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,603
- She was hung during the trials.
- Wow.

636
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,650
After Bathsheba married Jedson,
they had a baby...

637
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,649
...and when the baby was 7 days old...

638
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:11,730
...Jedson caught her sacrificing it
in front of the fireplace.

639
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:13,962
She ran out to that tree by the dock...

640
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,282
...climbed up, proclaimed her love
to Satan...

641
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:20,331
...cursed anyone who tried
to take her land, and hung herself.

642
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:25,767
Time of death was pronounced at 3:07
in the morning.

643
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:27,884
Well, that explains a few things.

644
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:29,769
Yeah, so does this.

645
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:33,081
Her last name's Walker.
She lived there in the '30s.

646
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,329
She had a boy named Rory who
mysteriously disappeared in the woods.

647
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,289
Then she killed herself in the cellar.

648
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,367
And that's not all.

649
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:47,721
So, what was the original 200-acre farm
has since been subdivided and sold off.

650
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:51,891
There was another boy who drowned in
a pond here. He lived in a house over here.

651
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:56,170
And a woman who worked as a maid in a
neighboring home, she committed suicide too.

652
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:59,923
People who took her land.

653
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,807
<i>I'm sitting here with Carolyn Perron...</i>

654
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:07,169
<i>...who, with her family, has been
experiencing supernatural occurrences.</i>

655
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:10,091
<i>Okay, go ahead.</i>

656
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:15,368
<i>From the first occurrence.</i>

657
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,040
Here's Brad.

658
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:57,450
- You find it okay?
- Oh, yeah.

659
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:58,965
Drew, this is Officer Brad.

660
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:01,686
Officer Brad Hamilton,
Harrisville, Rhode Island P.D.

661
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:03,729
Hm. Nice to meet you, man.

662
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:07,721
- So you're the lucky new cop, huh?
- Guess so.

663
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:11,049
- You know you can't shoot ghosts, right?
- Take it easy on him, Drew.

664
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,441
All right, guys,
help me get this stuff unloaded.

665
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,085
You take this.

666
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:18,401
Hi, Roger.

667
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:27,921
All right. When you're finished here, why
don't you hit upstairs, all right, Drew?

668
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,286
You got it.

669
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:53,690
What's wrong with the Chevy?

670
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,282
Ugh, what's not wrong with her?

671
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,602
- Needs a new carburetor to start.
- Oh, yeah?

672
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:01,883
Kind of put fixing her up
on hold for a while.

673
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:03,485
Yeah. Ahem.

674
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,522
Hey, Brad, hand me a thermostat,
would you?

675
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:12,161
What's this, uh, do?

676
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:14,489
When there's an instant drop
in temperature...

677
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:17,086
...the thermostat
triggers the camera to take a picture.

678
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,568
You've actually caught things on film?

679
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:22,531
Well, yeah, that's, uh, the point.

680
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:26,243
Why, uh...? Why out here?

681
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:29,171
Well, this is where the witch
committed suicide.

682
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:33,964
She hung herself from that branch
right above where you're standing.

683
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,360
<i>How could a
mother kill her own child?</i>

684
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:44,929
It was never a child to her.

685
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:48,721
She just used her God-given gift
as the ultimate offense against him.

686
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:51,963
Witches believe it elevates their status
in the eyes of Satan.

687
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:01,881
Mm.

688
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:05,522
Wow.
That's a nice day at the beach, huh?

689
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,489
How did you know?

690
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:12,208
It's an insight. It's like a peek through
the curtain into another person's life.

691
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:16,045
Mm.

692
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:20,450
That day meant so much to me.
We were driving along the coast.

693
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:23,206
Nancy pointed out
how pretty the view was.

694
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:26,724
I thought this is a perfect opportunity
for a photo.

695
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:30,043
<i>We're gonna start fresh, you know?
A new house, a new beginning.</i>

696
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:33,568
<i>You should have seen Roger and the girls.
I've never seen them so happy.</i>

697
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:34,881
Cheese!

698
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:38,648
They mean the world to me.

699
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:51,083
Put your hand flat on the desk.

700
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:54,449
Yeah, and take it off.

701
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,405
Here we go.

702
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:04,887
See?

703
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:07,407
It just reveals to us what
the naked eye can't see.

704
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:09,090
Pretty far out, isn't it?

705
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,689
Yeah, it's groovy.

706
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,568
Drew, you got the Bolex ready for Brad?

707
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,081
Yeah, already locked and loaded, sir.

708
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:42,126
What? I had to go.

709
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:07,811
All the rooms are
coming in pretty good.

710
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:09,200
Good.

711
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,165
What's in the bottle?

712
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:18,007
Holy water.

713
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,561
Presence of religious icons...

714
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:25,769
...will get a reaction
from anything unholy.

715
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:29,209
Sort of pisses them off.

716
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:34,002
So I set these throughout the house,
see if I can stir things up a bit.

717
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:40,680
- Like holding a cross to a vampire?
- Yeah. Exactly.

718
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:43,202
Except I don't believe in vampires.

719
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:49,520
Wasn't me.

720
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:05,530
Brad, get the camera.

721
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:10,441
Okay.

722
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:21,203
All right, it's 9:18, we're headed down into the
cellar where the door's just opened on its own.

723
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:24,210
I have Lorraine and Officer Brad Hamilton
with me.

724
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:26,568
Let's keep the cellar light off.

725
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:43,404
Give us a sign that you wanna
communicate with us.

726
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,445
Hon, you all right?

727
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:20,246
There's definitely something here.

728
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:24,769
- All right, close the door. Move something.
- My hands are so cold.

729
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:28,326
Come on.

730
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:34,641
No.

731
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:36,450
It's gone. It's gone.

732
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,130
I got nothing.

733
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:39,771
Okay.

734
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:03,807
Well, like I said, it doesn't
always work when you want it to.

735
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:06,766
Yeah, maybe the camera picked
something up.

736
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:08,846
Watch out!

737
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:14,165
<i>For a guy who doesn't believe...</i>

738
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:17,688
...you looked a little freaked out
when that door slammed shut.

739
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:22,608
It must have been a draft.

740
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:24,809
Oh, that's funny.

741
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:27,926
A draft never put that look
on my face before.

742
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:32,364
I believe the clock.

743
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,604
It's 3:08.

744
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:47,370
Let me see your glasses.

745
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:48,727
For you.

746
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:52,641
I think I might take some girls for ice cream later on.
What do you say about that?

747
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:55,002
- Yeah!
- Honey, you wanna come?

748
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:58,209
I'm exhausted. I'm just gonna take a nap.
The late nights are getting to me.

749
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:00,761
That's probably a good idea.
Why don't you get some rest.

750
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:03,566
- Lorraine and I'll watch over things for a bit.
- Really?

751
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:06,451
I'm gonna take off.
I have a shift starting in an hour.

752
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,762
The house hasn't felt like this
in a long time.

753
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:11,884
I think the kids feel a lot safer
with you around.

754
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:17,886
- I could get used to this.
- What, me doing laundry?

755
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,843
- Ha-ha-ha.
- You're funny.

756
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:24,005
No, this place.

757
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,482
Nice, fresh country air.

758
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:32,851
They have such a beautiful family,
don't they?

759
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:37,483
Yeah, that little one, April,
did you see her bring me pancakes?

760
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:44,524
We've gotta help them.

761
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,411
I know.

762
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:50,080
- I'll start with the Chevy.
- Heh.

763
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:13,526
Carolyn!

764
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:15,607
Are you okay?

765
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:16,921
Carolyn, open the door.

766
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:18,161
Carolyn, open up!

767
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:26,207
Are you okay?

768
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:27,646
- Oh, I'm fine.
- Are you sick?

769
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:30,644
- I woke up feeling nauseous, that's all.
- I thought I saw...

770
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:33,041
I hear Roger and the girls.

771
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:34,281
One minute.

772
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:48,648
- Guys, do you wanna play a game?
- Boring!

773
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:49,926
Thank you, Daddy.

774
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,361
Let's go inside.

775
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:57,840
I thought that was you.

776
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,206
Hey, I hope you don't mind.

777
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:02,051
I got a good deal on a rebuild
at that wrecking yard in Smithfield.

778
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:05,289
- No, you look like you know what you're doing.
- Yeah, we'll see.

779
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:09,890
Got a nice place here, Roger.

780
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:12,401
Lorraine and I always wanted
a spot in the country.

781
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:13,891
I'll sell you this one.

782
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:17,605
Hey, hand me a wrench, would you?

783
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:24,689
Hey, uh, it really means a lot
to us to have you here.

784
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:27,923
I gotta admit, I was a little
bit skeptical going in.

785
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:32,283
Just wanna say thank you, though,
for coming out when you did.

786
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:37,687
I can't take the credit.
That's, uh... That's all Lorraine.

787
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:40,605
- I didn't want to.
- Oh. Why's that?

788
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:47,322
Whatever Lorraine sees, feels, touches,
it helps people.

789
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:49,608
But it also takes a toll on her.

790
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:51,205
Little piece each time.

791
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:57,891
Couple months ago
we were working on a case.

792
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:01,169
She saw something.

793
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:13,205
It took a real big piece.

794
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:16,645
When we got home...

795
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:19,844
...she went into our room,
locked herself in...

796
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,844
...didn't talk, didn't eat,
didn't come out for eight days.

797
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:25,131
What'd she see?

798
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:29,320
Get out of here!

799
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:31,640
I don't know.

800
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:33,810
And I won't ask.

801
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:54,563
I need to reload. You want some?

802
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:56,565
I'm good, thanks.

803
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:58,686
All right.

804
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:45,243
Look what she made me do.

805
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:31,241
Look what she made me do.

806
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:35,286
Hey.

807
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:43,767
Ed?

808
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:45,166
Look what she made me do!

809
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:48,964
Ed! Ed!

810
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:50,840
Ed!

811
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:53,166
Dude, you okay?

812
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:54,810
Hold up, Brad. What's going on?

813
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:57,884
I saw someone. There was
a woman dressed as a maid.

814
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:03,528
Ed? Ed, we're getting something.

815
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:11,644
- It's just Cindy. She's sleepwalking.
- No, wait. We need this.

816
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:13,401
Why do we need pictures of Cindy?

817
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:15,845
She didn't trigger it.

818
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,322
- What do you mean she didn't trigger it?
- Somebody's with her.

819
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:23,641
Who?

820
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:28,925
Cindy!

821
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:33,926
Cindy!

822
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:42,091
Cindy!

823
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:43,890
Hey, over here. It's safe.

824
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:45,929
There's someone else in there with her.

825
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:49,521
I'm hearing another voice. Here, listen.

826
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:56,527
Follow me. This way.

827
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,809
<i>This is where I hide.</i>

828
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:06,200
Cindy?

829
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:10,051
Cindy?

830
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:13,041
Where'd she go, Ed?

831
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:15,044
Windows are locked.

832
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:20,048
Ed, where'd she go?

833
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:22,925
Brad, get the UV light.

834
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:25,242
- The what?
- Just ask Drew.

835
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:29,170
- Drew, I need a UV light.
- Uh...

836
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:30,845
Here, that's it. Go, go, go, go!

837
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:38,925
Turn off the light.

838
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:44,130
Get out of the way.

839
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:48,406
Okay.

840
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:19,205
Hit the lights!

841
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:32,770
Found her.

842
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:35,447
Here we go.

843
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:38,281
- All right. You got her?
- Yeah.

844
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,049
That's where Rory hides
when he's afraid.

845
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:21,764
Hon? Could I have April's
music box, please?

846
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:27,571
- How's Cindy?
- She doesn't remember a thing.

847
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:31,851
Here you go.

848
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:33,886
Thank you.

849
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:12,885
Lorraine!

850
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:18,200
No.

851
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:32,320
Lorraine!

852
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:33,800
Lorraine!

853
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:39,571
Lorraine!

854
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:41,771
Lorraine!

855
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:35,651
She made me do it.

856
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:39,291
She made me do it.

857
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:03,611
She made me do it.

858
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:48,367
Ed!

859
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:50,369
Come on! Lorraine!

860
01:19:58,200 --> 01:19:59,326
Ed!

861
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:01,884
Ed, I know what she did.

862
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:04,651
- I got you. I know. It's okay.
- I know what she did.

863
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,724
I know what she did. She possessed
the mother to kill the child.

864
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:09,405
She visits Carolyn every night.

865
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:12,404
That's what the bruise marks are!
She's feeding off of her!

866
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:27,090
Uh...

867
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:28,765
Nancy?

868
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:34,480
Nancy!

869
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:36,166
Are you okay?

870
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:38,091
Nancy!

871
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:40,647
Grab her!

872
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:44,730
Daddy! Help!

873
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:46,681
Nancy!

874
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:55,001
Is she okay?

875
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:56,406
It's okay, I got you.

876
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:57,607
Did you get that?

877
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:01,086
Yeah.

878
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:07,244
I'll have the footage developed
and get it over to Father Gordon.

879
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:11,405
He's our liaison at the church.
I imagine we'll get a pretty fast response.

880
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:13,608
- Listen, Roger?
- Yeah?

881
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:16,963
Listen, when we get the exorcist,
I'll be back. But Lorraine...

882
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:20,203
- Yeah, I understand.
- Until then Drew's gonna keep an eye on you.

883
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:22,727
- Hey, Ed, thank you for everything.
- Yeah.

884
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:25,446
<i>Mommy?</i>

885
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:29,410
That's everything.

886
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:42,685
<i>Mommy?</i>

887
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,126
Judy?

888
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:03,805
Oh, God!

889
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:05,086
Judy?

890
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,683
Lorraine! Wait!

891
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:18,805
Lorraine. What?

892
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:20,325
Mom, it's me. Is Judy okay?

893
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:22,960
- What?
- Can you go check, please?

894
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:25,204
Damn it, Mom, just check, please!

895
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:28,204
- Are you gonna tell me what's going on?
- It's Judy.

896
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:29,885
What? What do you mean?

897
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:32,006
What?

898
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:35,522
Oh, thank God.

899
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:39,369
Mom, I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to scare you. I'll explain later, okay?

900
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,331
What the hell happened?

901
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:45,962
I had a vision of Judy in the water.

902
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:48,407
I know it was some kind of warning.

903
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:51,130
I know it.

904
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:52,520
Okay.

905
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:55,891
Let's get out of here.

906
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:46,360
- So?
- Yeah, well, you weren't kidding.

907
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:47,601
No.

908
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:52,564
Look, Ed, this is complicated
because the kids aren't baptized.

909
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:55,963
- No, I understand.
- And the family are not members of the church.

910
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:57,451
- Oh, come on.
- And...

911
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:01,762
The approval would have to come
directly from the Vatican.

912
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:06,044
Father, we've never seen nothing like this.

913
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:12,651
Yeah, well, neither have I.

914
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:23,249
Father, they don't have a lot of time.

915
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:25,080
All right.

916
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:28,164
I'll push it through myself.

917
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:30,288
- Thank you, Father. Thank you.
- Thank you.

918
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:33,764
- All right, we'll wait for your call.
- Yeah.

919
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:39,722
Mommy? Daddy?

920
01:25:57,160 --> 01:25:58,571
Mommy?

921
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:00,411
Daddy?

922
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:25,605
Dad?

923
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:43,365
Nanna?

924
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:46,011
Nanna?

925
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,286
Aah!

926
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:41,845
Nanna!

927
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:44,850
Nanna, help! Nanna, help!

928
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,047
Judy?

929
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:46,700
Nanna!

930
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:52,326
Help!

931
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:54,364
- Judy!
- Nanna!

932
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:56,369
- Judy, open the door!
- Mom!

933
01:27:58,360 --> 01:28:00,362
- Ed, there's something wrong.
- What?

934
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:04,641
Nanna!

935
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:06,884
- Judy!
- Help!

936
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:09,202
- Judy! Judy, open this door!
- What is it?

937
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:12,489
- What's wrong with her? Judy!
- Hey, move. Move, move, move, move.

938
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:14,284
Judy, get back, honey. Get back!

939
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:16,165
- Come on!
- Hurry.

940
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:18,803
Help! Help!

941
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:21,090
Get away from the door, Judy!

942
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:25,969
Aah!

943
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:27,804
Oh, God! Are you okay?

944
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:32,045
There was someone rocking
in the chair with Annabelle.

945
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:36,246
What?

946
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:40,720
It's okay.

947
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:02,085
She's still in the case.

948
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:05,927
It's okay.

949
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:08,770
It's okay. It's okay.

950
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:16,681
- Dad! Dad!
- Daddy!

951
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:19,207
Dad! Dad! Mom just left
with Christine and April.

952
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:21,840
She went in the car and drove away.
I don't know what happened.

953
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,641
- She smells like rotting meat.
- She didn't say what was going on.

954
01:29:24,680 --> 01:29:28,287
- What do you mean, she left? Left where?
- Gone! I don't know where she was going.

955
01:29:33,640 --> 01:29:35,369
Where are we going, Mom?

956
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:45,246
- Hello?
<i>- It's Roger.</i>

957
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:46,771
<i>Somethings going on with Carolyn.</i>

958
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:49,804
Andrea was here, said Carolyn took
off with Christine and April.

959
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:52,800
<i>- The girls said she smelled like rotten meat.</i>
- Possesses the mother...

960
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:55,645
...to kill the child, that's what she does.
She's taking them to the house.

961
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:57,680
Roger, get back to the house now.
I'll meet you.

962
01:29:57,800 --> 01:30:01,247
Lock the door, close the blinds.
Stay off the phone!

963
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:03,606
Go.

964
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:10,801
- I'm coming.
- No, you stay with Judy.

965
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:13,321
Only way to protect Judy
is if we stop this where it started.

966
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:16,609
Otherwise, she'll latch onto us again.
- That's exactly why I am going.

967
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:19,406
You think I'm gonna let you walk
into this alone?

968
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:21,411
I can't lose you.

969
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,240
You won't.

970
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:26,084
Let's finish this together.

971
01:30:44,920 --> 01:30:47,605
- Agh! It's locked.
- Carolyn!

972
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:49,207
Roger!

973
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:50,486
Get out of the way!

974
01:30:56,720 --> 01:30:58,370
- Roger!
- Ed!

975
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:00,124
- Carolyn!
- Ed!

976
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:02,680
- Carolyn!
- We're down here!

977
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:05,564
Carolyn, don't!
No, no! She's got...!

978
01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:07,848
Get her hand! Get the scissors!

979
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:21,447
- We gotta get her to the car!
- And bring her where?

980
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:23,608
To take her to the priest
for the exorcism.

981
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:25,165
- Where's April?
- April?

982
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:28,806
April!

983
01:31:29,480 --> 01:31:31,687
Take Christine to the car and find April!

984
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:32,927
April!

985
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:35,366
Come on!

986
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:47,881
- She won't let her leave the house.
- What do you mean?

987
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:50,321
- If we take her out, the witch will kill her.
- Agh!

988
01:31:56,920 --> 01:31:59,685
Roger!

989
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:01,205
Carolyn!

990
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:02,607
Go!

991
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:03,841
Carolyn?

992
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:11,441
Okay, I'm gonna put you in here.
Come on.

993
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:14,251
- Get in. Stay in here.
- I don't wanna stay here by myself.

994
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:16,209
Stay in here no matter what.
I'll be back.

995
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:18,806
I have to find April, okay?
I'll be back, I promise.

996
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:22,921
April?

997
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:27,120
You Okay?

998
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:33,280
Stop!

999
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:38,842
Brad! Brad!

1000
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:44,290
Aah!

1001
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:54,483
Let's get something to tie her up!

1002
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:03,445
Hold it.

1003
01:33:14,240 --> 01:33:16,925
I gotta call Father Gordon.
We gotta get him out here.

1004
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:19,447
He's too far away.
She won't make it. Look at her.

1005
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:32,526
- Then you need to leave.
- What are you talking about?

1006
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:34,808
I have to do it. The exorcism.

1007
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:38,204
What? I thought you said we
need a priest. You're not a priest.

1008
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:40,846
- Well, you got a better idea?
- He can do it.

1009
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:44,127
- You can do it.
- But you gotta get out of here.

1010
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:47,887
- I'm not leaving you!
- Damn it, I'm not doing this with you in here!

1011
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:52,963
God brought us together for a reason.
This is it.

1012
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:55,570
I'm gonna get the book.

1013
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:13,525
April!

1014
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:23,765
April!

1015
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:49,121
"In the name of the Father,
the Son, the Holy Spirit."

1016
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:29,961
April!

1017
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:31,962
Hold her still! Hold her still!

1018
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:33,884
Come here! Hold her still!

1019
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:43,960
April?

1020
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:51,887
April!

1021
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:53,610
April, you under there?

1022
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:56,081
April!

1023
01:37:01,720 --> 01:37:04,724
Carolyn. Carolyn. Don't give in!
Don't let her take you!

1024
01:37:04,920 --> 01:37:06,968
Ed! You gotta stop,
you're killing her. Stop!

1025
01:37:07,120 --> 01:37:08,485
No, he can't!

1026
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:13,331
Roger, help me!

1027
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:20,242
Ed! Goddamn it, stop it!

1028
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:22,846
Understand this! We are
now fighting for her soul!

1029
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,243
"In the name of Jesus Christ,
the saints and all the angels...

1030
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:28,522
...I command you to reveal yourself!"

1031
01:37:57,920 --> 01:38:00,491
Roger, help me!

1032
01:38:51,720 --> 01:38:53,131
Put her down!

1033
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:55,286
Put her down!

1034
01:38:57,480 --> 01:38:58,561
Put her down!

1035
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:01,646
Carolyn!

1036
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:03,166
Carolyn!

1037
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:08,002
- Ed, look out!
- Unh!

1038
01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:12,965
Are you okay?

1039
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:16,928
Hold her still! Don't let her up!

1040
01:39:17,080 --> 01:39:18,491
We're losing her, Roger!

1041
01:39:18,680 --> 01:39:21,206
Damn you! You leave my family alone,
you hear me?

1042
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:24,011
I don't know what you are, but you leave
my wife alone, goddamn it!

1043
01:39:24,160 --> 01:39:27,164
Let her go!
Do you hear me? Let her go!

1044
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:31,961
Let her go, goddamn it! Let her go!

1045
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:40,482
She's already gone.

1046
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:43,328
And now you're all gonna die.

1047
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:51,881
April!

1048
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:55,931
I found her! She's under the house!
Under the kitchen!

1049
01:39:57,440 --> 01:39:58,521
Don't! No!

1050
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:00,691
Get her!

1051
01:40:15,080 --> 01:40:16,525
- Here.
- Carolyn!

1052
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:21,408
- Carolyn!
- She's in that hole. Right there.

1053
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,128
Carolyn? Oh, my God. No!

1054
01:40:26,280 --> 01:40:29,011
Can't go in. Can't reach.

1055
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:30,680
No! Carolyn, don't!

1056
01:40:33,080 --> 01:40:34,411
Carolyn, no!

1057
01:40:34,680 --> 01:40:36,569
Bathsheba!

1058
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:42,970
By the power of God,
I condemn you back to hell!

1059
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:46,930
This is your daughter!

1060
01:40:49,080 --> 01:40:51,765
- You can't give in!
- Agh!

1061
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:54,161
Roger. We need to get her
to fight from the inside.

1062
01:40:54,320 --> 01:40:56,891
Don't let her do this.
Don't let this thing do this.

1063
01:40:57,040 --> 01:40:59,281
You gotta fight it.
You're stronger than she is.

1064
01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:01,329
- You gotta fight!
- Keep it going, Roger!

1065
01:41:01,480 --> 01:41:04,245
You gotta stay with us, all right?
Come on back, Carolyn.

1066
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:06,290
You're in, that's it! Get her back!

1067
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:09,091
- Remember what you showed me.
- No!

1068
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,480
Remember that day that you said
you would never forget.

1069
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:25,567
You said they
meant the world to you.

1070
01:41:26,120 --> 01:41:28,327
This is what you'll be leaving behind.

1071
01:42:07,200 --> 01:42:08,486
Mommy?

1072
01:42:36,120 --> 01:42:37,485
Oh.

1073
01:42:41,720 --> 01:42:43,210
It's over.

1074
01:42:43,680 --> 01:42:45,284
I am so sorry.

1075
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:49,445
I love you so much. I love you so much.

1076
01:42:49,640 --> 01:42:50,971
I love you so much.

1077
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:53,924
I'm so happy.

1078
01:43:15,880 --> 01:43:17,609
A draft do that to your face?

1079
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:20,482
I'd take a guy with a gun any day.

1080
01:43:24,680 --> 01:43:26,205
You did good.

1081
01:43:26,640 --> 01:43:28,051
No, you did.

1082
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:31,809
I'll call Father Gordon
and let him know what happened.

1083
01:44:32,720 --> 01:44:34,290
Sounds good.

1084
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:02,126
The Vatican approved the exorcism.

1085
01:45:02,440 --> 01:45:04,442
Heh. Nice timing.

1086
01:45:06,040 --> 01:45:09,726
And if we can, then he'd like
to meet with us tomorrow.

1087
01:45:09,880 --> 01:45:12,406
There's a case in Long Island
he'd like to discuss.

1088
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:13,641
Really?
