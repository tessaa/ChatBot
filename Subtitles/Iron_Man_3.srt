1
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:35,884
Half-hour 'till the ball drops.

2
00:00:36,844 --> 00:00:39,057
Tony Stark, great speech, man!

3
00:00:39,351 --> 00:00:40,686
I gave a speech?

4
00:00:40,686 --> 00:00:42,724
How was it? - Edifying. - Unintelligible.

5
00:00:42,724 --> 00:00:44,959
Really? 
That's my favorite kind, a winning combo.

6
00:00:44,959 --> 00:00:49,100
Hey, uh, where are we going? - Uh, to
town on each other, probably back at
your house. I want to see your research.

7
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,006
Okay, you can see my research, but that's...
I'm not going to show you my "town".

8
00:00:52,006 --> 00:00:56,073
Mr. Stark, Ho Yinsen.
- Hey, I finally met a man called Hope.

9
00:00:56,464 --> 00:00:59,796
I'd like to introduce you to our guest, Doctor Wu.

10
00:01:00,008 --> 00:01:01,358
Oh this guy. 
- Mr. Stark.

11
00:01:01,614 --> 00:01:02,477
Hey.

12
00:01:03,326 --> 00:01:04,755
Perhaps another time?

13
00:01:05,913 --> 00:01:07,917
Bern, Switzerland 1999

14
00:01:10,154 --> 00:01:10,920
The old days,

15
00:01:12,279 --> 00:01:13,921
I never thought they'd come back to bite me.

16
00:01:14,692 --> 00:01:15,622
Why would they?

17
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:20,836
Hey Tony! 
Aldrich Killian, I'm a big fan of your work.

18
00:01:20,836 --> 00:01:22,234
My work? - Who is he? He means me.

19
00:01:22,234 --> 00:01:28,302
Well, of course, but Miss Hansen, my organization has
been tracking your research since year two of M.I.T.

20
00:01:29,873 --> 00:01:31,213
Oh wow, he made it. He made the cut.

21
00:01:31,213 --> 00:01:34,163
What floor you going to, pal?
- Well now, that is an appropriate question.

22
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:38,147
The ground floor, actually,
of a proposal I'm putting together myself.

23
00:01:38,475 --> 00:01:41,773
It's a privately-funded think tank
called "Advanced Idea Mechanics"

24
00:01:42,085 --> 00:01:45,653
She'll take both. 
One to throw away and one to not call.

25
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:49,483
"Advanced Idea Mechanics" 
or AIM for short, you get it?

26
00:01:49,483 --> 00:01:51,292
I see that 'cause it's on your t-shirt.

27
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,796
Ladies, follow the mullet. Ladies first.

28
00:01:55,129 --> 00:01:56,092
Thank you. I'll call you.

29
00:01:59,258 --> 00:02:01,424
I am titillated by the notion of working with you.

30
00:02:02,329 --> 00:02:04,543
I'm going to ditch these clowns;
I'll see you up on the roof in five minutes.

31
00:02:05,138 --> 00:02:07,188
I'm just going to try to get my beef wet real
quick if you know what I'm talkin' about.

32
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:08,532
I'll see you up there!

33
00:02:08,752 --> 00:02:09,484
Damn betcha.

34
00:02:09,484 --> 00:02:11,963
Come on, I thought that was just a theory.

35
00:02:11,963 --> 00:02:13,033
Well... it was.

36
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:17,934
If I'm right, we can access the area of the brain
that governs repair and chemically recode it.

37
00:02:17,934 --> 00:02:19,823
That's incredible.

38
00:02:19,823 --> 00:02:22,493
Essentially, you're hacking into the genetic
operating system of a living organism.

39
00:02:22,493 --> 00:02:23,764
Exactly.

40
00:02:24,414 --> 00:02:27,823
Can you not touch my plant? It's not...
she doesn't like it. She perfers -

41
00:02:28,103 --> 00:02:30,704
She's not like the others.
Come on, let's go to the bedroom.

42
00:02:30,704 --> 00:02:34,623
Happy, leave her ficus alone. - No, seriously, don't

43
00:02:34,623 --> 00:02:38,493
- And you're starting with plants? 
- For now, yes.

44
00:02:38,744 --> 00:02:43,243
I'm calling it "Extremis" - Well, its
- human application - Exactly!

45
00:02:43,484 --> 00:02:46,193
Dentra-degree vitalization

46
00:02:46,414 --> 00:02:48,434
Disease prevention

47
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:49,766
Even limb regrowth.

48
00:02:50,383 --> 00:02:52,014
You're the most gifted woman I've ever met.

49
00:02:52,014 --> 00:02:54,103
Wow... - In Switzerland.

50
00:02:54,404 --> 00:02:57,163
That's better. - This week

51
00:02:57,992 --> 00:02:59,713
You almost bought it, didn't you?

52
00:03:11,133 --> 00:03:13,793
This is what I'm talking about, the glitch.
- Have you checked the telomerase algorithm?

53
00:03:16,053 --> 00:03:18,344
We're good.

54
00:03:18,664 --> 00:03:19,634
Stay down.

55
00:03:19,634 --> 00:03:21,833
You're right on me...

56
00:03:22,723 --> 00:03:23,853
What the hell was that?

57
00:03:25,254 --> 00:03:27,423
What the hell was that? - It's a glitch in my work...
- She was just talking about it.

58
00:03:27,423 --> 00:03:29,963
Glitches happen. - Oh, it's not Y2K...

59
00:03:31,454 --> 00:03:32,773
Hey, Happy New Year
- Happy New Year - Happy New Year

60
00:03:33,273 --> 00:03:35,413
Alright, I'll see you in the morning, okay? 
Good night.

61
00:03:35,413 --> 00:03:37,173
You good? - Yep. - I'll be right outside. - Okay, cool.

62
00:03:58,086 --> 00:04:03,624
So, why am I telling you this?
Because I had just created demons,

63
00:04:04,142 --> 00:04:05,673
and I didn't even know it.

64
00:04:07,924 --> 00:04:09,923
Yeah, those were good times.

65
00:04:11,133 --> 00:04:12,674
Then I moved on.

66
00:04:13,084 --> 00:04:16,653
After a brief soiree in an Afghan cave,
I said "Goodbye" to the party scene.

67
00:04:17,153 --> 00:04:19,433
I forgot that night in Switzerland.

68
00:04:19,433 --> 00:04:21,903
These days I'm a changed man.

69
00:04:22,534 --> 00:04:24,964
I'm different now.

70
00:04:25,383 --> 00:04:27,384
I'm... well, you know who I am.

71
00:04:28,503 --> 00:04:31,173
...Sir, please may I request
just a few hours to calibrate -

72
00:04:31,424 --> 00:04:33,023
Nope!

73
00:04:35,814 --> 00:04:37,813
Micro-repeater implanting sequence complete!

74
00:04:37,813 --> 00:04:41,752
As you wish, sir. I've also prepared a
safety briefing for you to enitrely ignore.

75
00:04:41,752 --> 00:04:43,303
Which I will.

76
00:04:43,303 --> 00:04:44,823
Alright, let's do this.

77
00:04:45,393 --> 00:04:46,793
Dummy

78
00:04:46,793 --> 00:04:50,002
Hi Dummy. How did you get that cap on your head?
You earned it.

79
00:04:53,443 --> 00:04:55,573
Hey. Hey! What are you doing out of the corner?
You know what you did.

80
00:04:56,033 --> 00:04:58,014
Blood on my mat; handle it.

81
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:01,634
Sir, may I remind you that you've
been awake for nearly 72 hours

82
00:05:03,384 --> 00:05:05,494
Focus up ladies. Good evening

83
00:05:05,494 --> 00:05:07,104
And welcome to the birthing suite.

84
00:05:07,104 --> 00:05:12,814
I am pleased to announce the imminent
arrival of your bouncing, badass baby brother.

85
00:05:14,426 --> 00:05:16,567
Start titan and go white. Stamp date and time.

86
00:05:17,586 --> 00:05:20,434
Mark 42 autonomous prehensile propulsion suit test

87
00:05:20,971 --> 00:05:22,037
Initialize sequence.

88
00:05:24,514 --> 00:05:26,933
Jarvis - drop my needle

89
00:05:50,732 --> 00:05:51,693
Crap

90
00:06:10,543 --> 00:06:13,663
Alright, I think we got this. Send them all.

91
00:06:20,364 --> 00:06:24,424
Probably just a little fast... slow it down.
Slow it down just a... little bit.

92
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:34,204
Cool it, will you Jarvis?

93
00:06:44,263 --> 00:06:45,522
Come on.

94
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,414
I ain't scared of you.

95
00:06:54,344 --> 00:06:56,183
I'm the best

96
00:07:01,993 --> 00:07:04,673
As always sir, a great pleasure watching you work.

97
00:07:05,704 --> 00:07:08,872
I guess 72 hours is a long time between siestas

98
00:07:09,433 --> 00:07:11,542
Didn't think it could get any worse

99
00:07:14,063 --> 00:07:15,674
Then they had to go and turn on the TV.

100
00:07:19,603 --> 00:07:21,383
That's when 'He' happened.

101
00:07:30,254 --> 00:07:32,713
Some people call me a terrorist

102
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:38,153
I consider myself a teacher

103
00:07:40,243 --> 00:07:42,074
America...

104
00:07:43,343 --> 00:07:46,583
Ready for another lesson.

105
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:49,633
In 1864 in Sand Creek, Colorado,

106
00:07:49,633 --> 00:07:54,882
The U.S. military waited until the friendly
Cheyenne Braves had all gone hunting

107
00:07:54,882 --> 00:07:59,033
Waited to attack and slaughter the families left behind

108
00:07:59,033 --> 00:08:02,563
And claim their land

109
00:08:02,563 --> 00:08:08,654
39 hours ago,
the Ali Al Salem Air Base in Kuwait was attacked.

110
00:08:09,324 --> 00:08:11,513
I did that.

111
00:08:11,513 --> 00:08:15,253
A quaint military church,
filled with wives and children of course

112
00:08:18,433 --> 00:08:21,633
The soliders were out on manuvers.

113
00:08:22,443 --> 00:08:25,513
The "Braves" were away.

114
00:08:25,984 --> 00:08:31,304
President Ellis,
you continue to resist my attempts to educate you, sir.

115
00:08:31,304 --> 00:08:34,024
And now, you've missed me again

116
00:08:36,613 --> 00:08:41,063
You know who I am. You don't know where I am

117
00:08:42,212 --> 00:08:45,144
And you'll never see me coming.

118
00:08:48,233 --> 00:08:50,853
...and now that we seem to be back, let's recap
some of the frightening developments in this story.

119
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:53,164
American airways were hijacked.

120
00:08:53,164 --> 00:08:54,684
The nation remains on high alert.

121
00:08:54,684 --> 00:08:57,753
All attempts to find the Mandarin
have so far proved unsuccessful.

122
00:08:57,753 --> 00:09:02,674
Central to my administration's response to this
terrorist event is a newly-minted resource.

123
00:09:03,154 --> 00:09:06,453
I know him as Colonel James Rhodes.

124
00:09:06,453 --> 00:09:09,983
The American people will soon
know him as the Iron Patriot.

125
00:09:10,222 --> 00:09:13,023
And how is President Ellis responding?

126
00:09:13,304 --> 00:09:17,574
By taking the guy they call "War
Machine" and giving him a paint job

127
00:09:17,574 --> 00:09:21,824
The same suit but painted red, white,
and blue, look at that

128
00:09:21,824 --> 00:09:24,723
And they've also renamed him Iron Patriot

129
00:09:24,723 --> 00:09:27,753
You know, just in case the paint was too subtle

130
00:09:28,284 --> 00:09:30,173
It tested well with focus groups, alright?

131
00:09:30,173 --> 00:09:31,943
I am Iron Patriot. - Listen.

132
00:09:31,943 --> 00:09:35,873
War Machine was a little too aggressive, alright.
This sends a better message.

133
00:09:37,203 --> 00:09:40,603
So what's really going on? With Mandarin

134
00:09:41,454 --> 00:09:44,133
Seriously, can we talk about this guy?

135
00:09:46,793 --> 00:09:49,292
It's classified information, Tony.

136
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:52,473
Okay, there've been nine bombings - Nine...

137
00:09:52,473 --> 00:09:54,104
The public only knows about three.

138
00:09:54,104 --> 00:09:57,243
But here's the thing... nobody can ID a device.

139
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:59,823
There's no bomb casings - You know I can help

140
00:09:59,823 --> 00:10:04,293
Just ask. I got a ton of new tech.
I got a prehensile suit. I got

141
00:10:04,293 --> 00:10:04,814
Bomb disposal

142
00:10:04,814 --> 00:10:06,254
Catches explosions mid-air

143
00:10:06,254 --> 00:10:09,723
When's the last time you got a good night's sleep?
- Einstein slept three hours a year. Look what he did.

144
00:10:10,013 --> 00:10:13,403
People are concerned about you, Tony.
I'm concerned about you.

145
00:10:13,403 --> 00:10:15,554
You gonna come at me like that?
- No, look, I'm not trying to be a dic-

146
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:19,353
- tator. - Would you mind signing my drawing?

147
00:10:19,353 --> 00:10:22,384
If Richard doesn't mind. You alright with this, Dick?
- Fine with me.

148
00:10:25,172 --> 00:10:26,654
What is your name? - Erin.

149
00:10:28,254 --> 00:10:30,684
By the way, I liked you in "A Christmas Story".

150
00:10:31,574 --> 00:10:33,643
Listen, the Pentagon is scared.

151
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,712
After what happened in New York... aliens, come on.

152
00:10:35,712 --> 00:10:38,223
They need to look strong.

153
00:10:38,683 --> 00:10:42,723
Stopping the Mandarin is a priority, but it's not
- It's not superhero business.

154
00:10:42,723 --> 00:10:43,824
No, it's not, quite frankly.

155
00:10:43,824 --> 00:10:45,813
It's American business.

156
00:10:46,574 --> 00:10:48,833
Are you okay?

157
00:10:49,893 --> 00:10:52,743
I broke the crayon. - Are you okay, Mr. Stark?

158
00:10:52,743 --> 00:10:54,882
Take it easy. Tony...

159
00:10:56,223 --> 00:10:58,703
....How did you get out of the wormhole?

160
00:10:58,913 --> 00:11:00,733
Tony - What'd you say?!

161
00:11:02,273 --> 00:11:03,423
Sorry. Have to check on the suit... make sure...

162
00:11:10,374 --> 00:11:12,993
Check the heart, check the, check the, is it the brain?

163
00:11:13,253 --> 00:11:16,183
No sign of cardiac analomy or unusual brain activity

164
00:11:16,404 --> 00:11:18,304
Okay, so I was poisoned?

165
00:11:18,993 --> 00:11:22,703
My diagnosis is that you've
experienced a severe anxiety attack.

166
00:11:25,993 --> 00:11:26,733
Me?

167
00:11:27,994 --> 00:11:30,443
Come on man, this isn't a good look. Open up.
- Sorry, I gotta split.

168
00:11:33,643 --> 00:11:40,053
Badge... badge... badge

169
00:11:40,053 --> 00:11:42,633
Badge, guys. I put a memo in the toliet; come on.

170
00:11:42,883 --> 00:11:45,793
Tony has got them in his basement, they're wearing
party hats, this is an asset we can put to use

171
00:11:47,364 --> 00:11:51,314
Uh-huh. So, you're suggesting that I replace
the entire janitorial staff with robots?

172
00:11:51,563 --> 00:11:56,073
What I'm saying is that the human element of
Human Resources is our biggest point of vulnerability

173
00:11:56,073 --> 00:11:57,913
We should start phasing it out immediately.

174
00:11:58,603 --> 00:12:00,033
What!? - Excuse me, Bambi

175
00:12:00,424 --> 00:12:02,494
Did you just say that? - Security

176
00:12:02,494 --> 00:12:07,603
Happy, okay, I am thrilled that you're
now the Head of Security, okay; it is the
perfect position for you. - Thank you

177
00:12:07,603 --> 00:12:09,172
However, - I do appreciate it

178
00:12:09,172 --> 00:12:11,873
Since you've taken the post,
- You don't have to thank me.

179
00:12:11,873 --> 00:12:14,573
We've had a rise in staff complaints of 300 percent

180
00:12:14,782 --> 00:12:17,433
Thank you. - That's not a compliment.

181
00:12:17,433 --> 00:12:21,093
"That's not a compliment"? It is a compliment!
Clearly somebody is trying to hide something.

182
00:12:21,943 --> 00:12:24,103
Excuse me. - Yes? - Miss Potts, your four o'clock is here.

183
00:12:24,103 --> 00:12:27,243
Did you clear this four o'clock with me?
- Happy, we'll talk about this later

184
00:12:27,243 --> 00:12:30,073
But right now I have to go deal
with this very annoying thing.

185
00:12:30,073 --> 00:12:31,533
How so?

186
00:12:32,093 --> 00:12:35,213
I used to work with him, and he used to ask
me out all the time, so it's a little awkward.

187
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:37,073
I don't like the sound of that.

188
00:12:42,504 --> 00:12:45,243
Pepper. - Killian?

189
00:12:45,243 --> 00:12:47,984
You look great... you look really great.

190
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:54,103
God, you look great. I... I... I can't...
what on Earth have you been doing?

191
00:12:54,534 --> 00:12:57,773
Nothing fancy,
just five years in the hands of physical therapists

192
00:12:57,773 --> 00:12:59,993
And please, call me Aldrich.

193
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:03,423
Uh, you were supposed to be issued a security badge
- Happy, it's okay.

194
00:13:03,423 --> 00:13:04,823
Yes? - We're good.

195
00:13:04,823 --> 00:13:06,143
You sure? - Yes.

196
00:13:06,143 --> 00:13:07,923
Stand down. - I'm going to linger

197
00:13:07,923 --> 00:13:09,353
Thank you. - Right here, okay.

198
00:13:09,353 --> 00:13:11,182
It's very nice to see you, Killian.

199
00:13:18,453 --> 00:13:20,163
Hey, guy

200
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:28,683
Merry Christmas

201
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:34,548
After years dodging the president's
ban on "immoral biotech research",

202
00:13:34,548 --> 00:13:45,399
My think tank now has a little something in the pipeline.
It's an idea we like to call "Extremis".

203
00:13:45,755 --> 00:13:47,370
I'm gonna turn your lights down.

204
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:52,061
Regard the human brain

205
00:13:58,227 --> 00:14:01,486
Uh, wait, hold on, hold on; that's,
that's the universe, my bad.

206
00:14:01,486 --> 00:14:03,966
But if I do that...

207
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:12,186
That's the brain, strangely memetic though,
wouldn't you say?

208
00:14:12,728 --> 00:14:14,903
Wow, that's amazing! - Thanks, it's mine.

209
00:14:15,592 --> 00:14:18,713
What? - This... you're inside my head.

210
00:14:18,713 --> 00:14:22,359
It's a live feed. Come on up, I'll prove it to you.

211
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:26,068
Come on.

212
00:14:28,652 --> 00:14:32,247
Pinch my arm. I can take it. Pinch me.

213
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:37,558
What is that? - The primary somatosensory cortex

214
00:14:37,558 --> 00:14:42,400
It's the brain's pain center, but this...
is what I wanted to show you.

215
00:14:44,993 --> 00:14:48,537
Now, "Extremis" harnesses our bioelectrical potential

216
00:14:49,734 --> 00:14:51,615
And it goes... here.

217
00:14:52,206 --> 00:15:01,683
This is essentially an empty slot, and what
this tells us is that our mind, our entire DNA
in fact, is destined to be upgraded. - Wow.

218
00:15:10,475 --> 00:15:14,056
Hello? - Is this forehead of Security?

219
00:15:14,262 --> 00:15:18,433
What? You know, look, I got a real job. What
do you want? I'm working; I got something
going on here. - What? Harassing interns?

220
00:15:18,433 --> 00:15:21,059
Let me tell you something, you know what
happened when I told people I was Iron Man's
bodyguard? They would laugh in my face.

221
00:15:21,994 --> 00:15:24,201
I had to leave while I still had a shred of dignity.

222
00:15:24,201 --> 00:15:26,415
Now I got a real job; I'm watching Pepper.

223
00:15:26,415 --> 00:15:28,259
What's going on? Fill me in.

224
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:29,409
For real? - Yeah.

225
00:15:29,409 --> 00:15:32,426
Alright, so she's meeting up with this scientist...
rich guy, handsome

226
00:15:32,426 --> 00:15:34,052
I couldn't make his face at first

227
00:15:34,052 --> 00:15:35,861
And you know I'm good with faces.
- Oh yeah, you're the best.

228
00:15:35,861 --> 00:15:42,532
Yeah, so I run his credentials, I make him.
Aldrich Killian. We actually met the guy...
where were we in 1999? The science conference?

229
00:15:42,835 --> 00:15:45,592
Switzerland. - Right, right, exactly.

230
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:49,004
Killian, I don't remember that guy - Of course you
don't remember; he's not a blonde with a big rack.

231
00:15:49,353 --> 00:15:54,724
At first it was fine, they were talking business, but now
it's like getting weird... he's showing her his big brain.

232
00:15:54,724 --> 00:15:57,680
His what? - Big brain, and she likes it.

233
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,801
Here, let me show you. Hold on. See?

234
00:15:59,801 --> 00:16:03,071
Look at what? You watching them?
Flip the screen and then we can get started.

235
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:05,943
I'm not a tech genius like you,
just trust me, get down here.

236
00:16:05,943 --> 00:16:09,056
Flip the screen, then I can see what they're doing.
- I don't know how to flip the screen!

237
00:16:09,276 --> 00:16:11,405
Don't talk to me like that anymore. You're not my boss.

238
00:16:11,623 --> 00:16:17,173
Alright, I don't work for you, and I don't trust this guy.
He's got another guy with him; he's shifty.

239
00:16:18,074 --> 00:16:20,939
Relax. I'm just asking you to secure the perimeter.
Tell him to go out for a drink or something.

240
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:23,039
You know what? You should take more
of an interest in what's going on here.

241
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:25,433
This woman is the best thing that ever happened to you

242
00:16:25,433 --> 00:16:27,355
And you're just ignoring her. - A giant brain?

243
00:16:27,355 --> 00:16:30,281
Yeah, there's a giant brain, there's a shifty character...

244
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:33,172
I'm going to follow this guy.
I'm going to run his plates and if it gets rough, so be it.

245
00:16:33,768 --> 00:16:37,382
I miss you, Happy.
- Yeah, I miss you too but the way it used to be.

246
00:16:37,382 --> 00:16:39,770
Now you're off with the 'superfriends'...
I don't know what's going on with you
anymore. The world's gettin' weird

247
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:48,643
Hey I hate to cut you off, do you have your taser
on you? - Why? - I think there's a gal in HR who
is trying to steal some printer ink. You should
probably go over there and zap her. - Yeah, nice.

248
00:16:49,326 --> 00:16:55,982
Imagine if you could hack into the hard drive
of any living organism and recode its DNA

249
00:16:56,309 --> 00:16:57,833
It would be incredible.

250
00:16:58,302 --> 00:17:02,078
Unfortunately, to my ears it also
sounds highly weaponizable

251
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:05,857
As in enhanced soldiers,
private armies, and Tony is not-

252
00:17:05,857 --> 00:17:07,607
Tony, Tony

253
00:17:07,607 --> 00:17:10,860
You know, I invited Tony to join AIM

254
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:14,345
13 years ago and he turned me down

255
00:17:15,197 --> 00:17:24,635
But something tells me now there is a new genius
on the throne, who doesn't have to answer to
Tony anymore and who has slightly less of an ego.

256
00:17:25,573 --> 00:17:30,843
It's going to be a "no", Aldrich...
as much as I'd like to help you.

257
00:17:32,896 --> 00:17:37,758
I can't say that I'm not disappointed,
but as my father used to say

258
00:17:37,758 --> 00:17:40,769
"Failure is the fog through which we glimpse triumph."

259
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:43,747
It's very deep, and I have no idea what it means.

260
00:17:43,747 --> 00:17:46,642
Well, he was kind of an idiot, my old man.

261
00:17:47,763 --> 00:17:50,124
I'm sure I'll see you again, Pepper.

262
00:18:00,777 --> 00:18:05,136
Happy - The car is ready... if you're ready to go.

263
00:18:07,048 --> 00:18:13,937
Yes, I just um, God,
I forgot my other thing so I'm just gonna...

264
00:18:41,709 --> 00:18:45,257
I'm sorry I'm late. I was... what is that?!

265
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:49,507
You're wearing this in the house now?
What is that, like Mark 15?

266
00:18:49,507 --> 00:18:52,765
Yeah, something like that.
You know everybody needs a hobby.

267
00:18:54,602 --> 00:19:01,255
Oh, and you have to wear your hobby in the
living room? Just breaking it in, you know, it's
always a little pinchy in the GUI-bagger at first.

268
00:19:01,255 --> 00:19:02,174
Oh hey, did you see your Christmas present?

269
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:08,677
Yes, I did. I don't know how I could
have missed that Christmas present.

270
00:19:08,677 --> 00:19:14,892
Is it gonna fit through the door? - Well actually,
uh, that's a good question, I got a team of guys
coming tomorrow. They're gonna blow out that wall.

271
00:19:15,439 --> 00:19:17,927
So, uh, tense? Good day?

272
00:19:18,213 --> 00:19:20,041
Oh shoulders, a little naughty. Naughty girl.

273
00:19:20,455 --> 00:19:23,764
I don't want to harp on this,
but did you like the custom rabbit?

274
00:19:23,978 --> 00:19:27,415
Did I like it? - Nailed it, right? - Wow.

275
00:19:27,889 --> 00:19:35,023
I appreciate the thought very much. So why don't
you lift up that facemask and give me a kiss.

276
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:39,326
Huh, yup, damnit. No can do.

277
00:19:39,326 --> 00:19:43,928
You want to just kiss it on the, uh, facial slit?

278
00:19:43,928 --> 00:19:48,663
Why don't I run down to the garage and see if I
can't find a crowbar to jimmy that thing open?

279
00:19:48,864 --> 00:19:52,535
A crowbar? Yeah...
- Oh, except there's been a radiation leak.

280
00:19:52,535 --> 00:19:54,509
I'll take my chances. - That's risky

281
00:19:54,741 --> 00:19:57,145
At least let me get you like a Hazmat suit

282
00:19:57,145 --> 00:20:00,313
or a Geiger counter or something like that

283
00:20:00,848 --> 00:20:06,173
Busted. - This is a new level of lame.

284
00:20:06,173 --> 00:20:08,138
Sorry. - You ate without me, already?

285
00:20:08,138 --> 00:20:10,095
On date night?

286
00:20:10,467 --> 00:20:11,739
He was just - You mean you

287
00:20:11,739 --> 00:20:16,766
Well yeah, I just mean we were just...
just hosting you while I finished up a little work.

288
00:20:17,203 --> 00:20:19,980
And yes, I had a quick bite.
I didn't know if you were coming home

289
00:20:20,227 --> 00:20:22,300
Or you were having drinks with Aldrich Killian.

290
00:20:25,034 --> 00:20:26,693
What?

291
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:29,431
Aldrich Killian? What are you checking up on me?

292
00:20:29,431 --> 00:20:30,827
Happy was concerned - No, you're spying on me.

293
00:20:30,827 --> 00:20:32,156
I'm going to bed. - Hold on. Come on. Pep-

294
00:20:32,156 --> 00:20:38,966
Hey, I admit it! My fault. Sorry.

295
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:46,269
I'm a piping hot mess. It's been going on for a while...
I haven't said anything.

296
00:20:48,741 --> 00:20:52,938
Nothing's been the same since New York. - Oh really?

297
00:20:52,938 --> 00:20:54,261
I didn't notice that, at all.

298
00:20:55,506 --> 00:20:59,806
You experience things and then they're
over and you still can't explain them.

299
00:21:00,566 --> 00:21:04,166
Gods, aliens, other dimensions...
I'm just a man in a can.

300
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:08,310
The only reason I haven't cracked up
is probably because you've moved in.

301
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,815
Which is great. I love you; I'm lucky.

302
00:21:11,221 --> 00:21:14,732
But honey... I can't sleep.

303
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:19,631
You go to bed, I come down here.
I do what I know; I tinker.

304
00:21:20,033 --> 00:21:23,547
The threat is imminent.

305
00:21:23,777 --> 00:21:26,418
And I have to protect the one
thing that I can't live without...

306
00:21:27,087 --> 00:21:30,554
That's you.
And my suits; they're uh...

307
00:21:31,426 --> 00:21:33,631
Machines. - They're part of me.

308
00:21:34,672 --> 00:21:38,188
A distraction. - Maybe.

309
00:21:55,549 --> 00:21:58,875
I'm gonna take a shower. - Okay.

310
00:22:02,331 --> 00:22:06,167
And you're going to join me. - Better.

311
00:22:24,632 --> 00:22:25,923
Tony!

312
00:22:34,531 --> 00:22:36,148
Power down!

313
00:22:43,564 --> 00:22:47,619
I must have called it in my sleep...
that's not supposed to happen.

314
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:53,001
I'll recalibrate the sensors.

315
00:22:54,504 --> 00:23:00,827
Just let me catch my breath, okay?
Don't go, alright? Pepper?

316
00:23:00,827 --> 00:23:03,836
I'm going to sleep downstairs. Tinker with that.

317
00:23:30,668 --> 00:23:33,275
Can you regulate?
- Yes, I can regulate.

318
00:23:33,275 --> 00:23:35,215
Are you sure about that? - Yes.

319
00:23:44,887 --> 00:23:46,611
It's a decent batch.

320
00:23:47,795 --> 00:23:53,899
Don't say I never did nothing for you.
- Thank you... I mean for understanding.

321
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,727
Ah, I'm sorry, buddy.

322
00:24:20,578 --> 00:24:21,751
What're ya doing, buddy?

323
00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:24,968
You out by yourself? A little date night?
Watching your favorite chick flick maybe?

324
00:24:25,233 --> 00:24:27,136
Yeah, a little movie called "The Party's Over"

325
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:30,253
Starring you and your junkie girlfriend,
and here's the ticket

326
00:24:30,253 --> 00:24:32,535
No kidding... that doesn't belong to you.

327
00:24:57,776 --> 00:25:03,807
Savin! Help! Help me!

328
00:26:27,979 --> 00:26:31,336
A true story about fortune cookies

329
00:26:31,336 --> 00:26:34,698
They look Chinese. They sound Chinese.

330
00:26:35,267 --> 00:26:38,810
But they're actually an American invention

331
00:26:39,136 --> 00:26:46,367
Which is why they're hollow, full of lies,
and leave a bad taste in the mouth

332
00:26:47,513 --> 00:26:52,682
My disciples just destroyed
another cheap American knock-off

333
00:26:52,682 --> 00:26:57,602
The Chinese Theater. Mr. President,

334
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:01,566
I know this must be getting frustrating

335
00:27:01,566 --> 00:27:05,158
But this season of terror is drawing to a close

336
00:27:05,923 --> 00:27:14,173
And don't worry...
the big one is coming: your graduation.

337
00:27:28,107 --> 00:27:31,085
Hi. - Oh, uh. - Mind leaving that on? - Sure.
- Sunday night's PBS "Downtown Abbey"

338
00:27:37,027 --> 00:27:44,160
That's the show. He thinks it's elegant.

339
00:27:48,924 --> 00:27:53,899
One more thing... make sure everyone wears
their badges. He's a stickler for that sort of thing,
plus my guys won't let anyone in without them.

340
00:27:55,108 --> 00:27:59,339
We're awaiting the arrival of Tony Stark.
We're hoping he'll give us the reaction...

341
00:27:59,339 --> 00:28:01,361
His reaction to the latest attack.

342
00:28:01,361 --> 00:28:02,980
Mr. Stark!

343
00:28:03,457 --> 00:28:07,016
Our sources are telling us that
this is another Mandarin attack.

344
00:28:07,016 --> 00:28:08,815
Anything else you can tell us?

345
00:28:09,178 --> 00:28:14,179
Hey Mr. Stark!
When is somebody going to kill this guy? Just sayin'.

346
00:28:16,819 --> 00:28:18,546
Is that what you want?

347
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:24,761
Here's a little Holiday greeting I've
been wanting to send to the Mandarin.

348
00:28:25,134 --> 00:28:27,701
I just didn't know how to phrase it until now.

349
00:28:28,507 --> 00:28:31,070
My name is Tony Stark and I'm not afraid of you

350
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:34,474
I know that you're a coward so I've decided

351
00:28:35,364 --> 00:28:37,384
That you just died, pal.

352
00:28:37,384 --> 00:28:39,209
I'm gonna come get the body.

353
00:28:39,209 --> 00:28:42,322
There's no politics here;
it's just good, old-fashioned revenge.

354
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:44,824
There's no Pentagon; it's just you and me.

355
00:28:45,178 --> 00:28:48,869
And on the off-chance you're a man,
here's my home address:

356
00:28:48,869 --> 00:28:54,310
10880, Malibu Port, 90265.

357
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:58,468
I'll leave the door unlocked.
That's what you wanted, right?

358
00:29:01,224 --> 00:29:02,689
Bill me.

359
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:09,976
I've compiled a Mandarin database for you, sir,

360
00:29:11,573 --> 00:29:15,443
Drawn from S.H.I.E.L.D., F.B.I., and C.I.A. intercepts.

361
00:29:15,753 --> 00:29:18,770
Initiating virtual crime scene reconstruction.

362
00:29:20,588 --> 00:29:23,212
Okay, what do we got here?

363
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:26,260
His name is an ancient Chinese war mantle

364
00:29:26,522 --> 00:29:27,839
Meaning "advisor to the King"

365
00:29:28,647 --> 00:29:30,651
South American insurgency tactics

366
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:33,044
Talks like a Bapist preacher

367
00:29:33,921 --> 00:29:37,263
There's lots of pagentry going on here... lots of theatre.

368
00:29:38,194 --> 00:29:42,289
Close. - The heat from the blast was
in excess of 3000 degrees Celsius.

369
00:29:42,654 --> 00:29:46,002
Any subjects within 12.5 yards were vaporized instantly.

370
00:29:46,424 --> 00:29:49,882
No bomb parts found in a 3-mile radius
of the Chinese theatre. - No, sir.

371
00:29:50,237 --> 00:29:53,230
Talk to me, Happy.

372
00:30:12,515 --> 00:30:14,920
When is a bomb not a bomb?

373
00:30:25,772 --> 00:30:29,228
Any military victims?
- Not according to public records, sir.

374
00:30:29,228 --> 00:30:31,798
Bring up the thermogenic signatures again,
factor in 3000 degrees

375
00:30:31,798 --> 00:30:35,808
The oracle cloud has completed analysis.

376
00:30:36,278 --> 00:30:43,271
Accessing satellites and plotting the last 12
months of thermogenic occurances now.

377
00:30:43,271 --> 00:30:46,413
Take away everywhere that
there's been a Mandarin attack.

378
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,727
Nope.

379
00:30:57,676 --> 00:30:59,899
That. You sure that's not one of his?

380
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:02,411
It predates any known Mandarin attack.

381
00:31:02,411 --> 00:31:04,853
The incident was the use of a bomb to assist a suicide.

382
00:31:04,853 --> 00:31:12,396
The heat signature is remarkably similar.

383
00:31:14,006 --> 00:31:15,917
That's two military guys...

384
00:31:16,809 --> 00:31:18,277
Ever been to Tennessee, Jarvis?

385
00:31:18,277 --> 00:31:20,392
Creating a flight plan for Tennessee.

386
00:31:26,027 --> 00:31:30,613
Are we still at "ding-dong"?
We're supposed to be on total security lockdown.

387
00:31:30,613 --> 00:31:33,223
Come on, I threatened a terrorist. Who is that?

388
00:31:33,223 --> 00:31:37,572
There's only so much I can do, sir,
when you give the world's press your home address.

389
00:31:48,808 --> 00:31:50,079
Right there's fine.

390
00:31:54,325 --> 00:32:01,204
You're not the Mandarin, are you? Are you?
- You don't remember.

391
00:32:01,751 --> 00:32:05,015
Why I am not surprised? - Don't take it personally,
I don't remember what I had for breakfast.

392
00:32:05,218 --> 00:32:06,759
Gluten-free waffles, sir. - That's right.

393
00:32:07,174 --> 00:32:12,268
Look, I need to be alone with you,
someplace not here... it's urgent.

394
00:32:14,076 --> 00:32:17,660
Normally, I'd go for that sort of thing,
but now I'm in a committed relationship

395
00:32:18,191 --> 00:32:22,166
It's... with her. - Tony,

396
00:32:23,549 --> 00:32:25,786
Is somebody there?
- Yeah, it's Maya Hansen.

397
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,890
Old botanist pal that I used to know, barely.

398
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:34,260
Please don't tell me that there is a 12-year-old
kid waiting in the car that I've never met.

399
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:38,392
He's 13. No, I need your help. - What for? Why now?

400
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:42,095
Because I read the papers, and, frankly,
I don't think you'll last the week.

401
00:32:42,095 --> 00:32:43,085
I'll be fine.

402
00:32:43,085 --> 00:32:44,113
I'm sorry.

403
00:32:44,113 --> 00:32:46,833
With Happy in the hospital,
I didn't know we were expecting guests.

404
00:32:46,833 --> 00:32:47,780
We weren't.

405
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:50,144
And old girlfriends - She's not really.

406
00:32:50,144 --> 00:32:52,472
No, not really. It was just one night.

407
00:32:52,678 --> 00:32:55,674
Yep. - That's how you did it, isn't it?

408
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:57,819
It was a great night. - Well... you know - Yeah.

409
00:32:57,819 --> 00:32:59,869
You have saved yourself a world of pain.
- What? - Trust me. - I'm sure.

410
00:32:59,869 --> 00:33:01,805
We're going out of town.

411
00:33:01,805 --> 00:33:03,671
Okay, we've been through this. Nope. - Yep!

412
00:33:03,671 --> 00:33:06,070
The man says no - Immediately and indefinitely.

413
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:09,847
Great idea. Let's go. - I'm sorry.
That's a terrible idea. Please don't touch her bags.

414
00:33:09,847 --> 00:33:13,183
Tony, this is how normal people behave.
- I can't protect you out there. I challenged-

415
00:33:13,183 --> 00:33:16,726
Is this normal? - Sadly, that - Yes, this is normal!

416
00:33:16,962 --> 00:33:19,910
Is very normal - It's a big bunny, relax about it!

417
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:22,058
Calm down! - I got this for you.

418
00:33:22,303 --> 00:33:25,231
I'm aware of that. - You still haven't even told me
that you liked it! - I don't like it! - I asked you three-

419
00:33:25,231 --> 00:33:26,760
You don't like it?!

420
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,189
We are leaving the house; that's not even up for
discussion. - I said no. - Guys... do we umm...

421
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:33,492
What? - Do we need to worry about that?

422
00:34:22,373 --> 00:34:24,735
I got you. - I got you first.

423
00:34:25,455 --> 00:34:27,304
Like I said, we can't stay here.

424
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:37,709
Move! I'm right behind-

425
00:34:42,529 --> 00:34:44,157
Get her, I'm going to find a way around.

426
00:34:44,648 --> 00:34:47,793
Stop stopping! Get her; get outside! Go!

427
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,969
Oh my God. Tony!

428
00:35:26,485 --> 00:35:28,304
Sir, Miss Potts is clear of the structure.

429
00:36:01,241 --> 00:36:04,944
Jarvis, where's my flight power?!
Working on it, sir. This is a prototype.

430
00:36:19,562 --> 00:36:21,038
That's one.

431
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:27,412
Sir, the suit is not combat-ready.

432
00:36:40,955 --> 00:36:42,393
That's two.

433
00:37:54,733 --> 00:37:56,487
Tony!

434
00:38:32,632 --> 00:38:34,897
Sir, take a deep breath.

435
00:38:49,413 --> 00:38:52,076
Flight power restored.

436
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,750
Sir.

437
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:12,149
Sir! - Alright, kill the alarm.

438
00:39:12,149 --> 00:39:16,762
That's the emergency alert triggered
by the power dropping below 5 %.

439
00:39:53,977 --> 00:39:56,943
Snow? Where are we, upstate?

440
00:39:56,943 --> 00:39:59,596
We are 5 miles outside of Rose Hills, Tennessee.

441
00:40:00,562 --> 00:40:01,743
Why?!

442
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:08,680
Jarvis! Not my idea! What are we doing here;
this is thousands of miles away,
I've gotta get Pepper, I've got to-

443
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,869
I prepared a flight plan.

444
00:40:10,869 --> 00:40:13,023
This was the location.

445
00:40:13,777 --> 00:40:16,732
Who asked you? Open the suit.
- I think I may be malfunctioning, sir. - Open eject.

446
00:40:24,654 --> 00:40:25,733
That's brisk!

447
00:40:34,959 --> 00:40:36,524
Maybe I'll just cozy back up for a bit.
- I actually think I need to sleep now, sir.

448
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:39,352
Jarvis.

449
00:40:42,055 --> 00:40:43,324
Jarvis?

450
00:40:45,458 --> 00:40:46,927
Don't leave me, buddy.

451
00:41:09,539 --> 00:41:12,924
Stark Secure Server:
Now transferring to all known receivers.

452
00:41:13,573 --> 00:41:14,741
Pepper, it's me.

453
00:41:14,741 --> 00:41:23,833
I've got a lot of apologies to make and not a lot of time,
so first off

454
00:41:23,833 --> 00:41:24,068
I'm so sorry I put you in harm's way.
That was selfish and stupid and it won't happen again.

455
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:27,526
Also, it's Christmas time. The rabbit's too big. Done.

456
00:41:28,146 --> 00:41:29,655
Sorry.

457
00:41:30,465 --> 00:41:34,286
And I'm sorry in advance because...
I can't come home yet

458
00:41:36,302 --> 00:41:39,893
I need to find this guy.
You gotta stay safe. That's all I know.

459
00:41:41,753 --> 00:41:44,059
I just stole a poncho from a wooden Indian.

460
00:42:09,307 --> 00:42:10,905
Let's get you comfy.

461
00:42:13,095 --> 00:42:14,461
You happy now?

462
00:42:25,547 --> 00:42:26,703
Freeze!

463
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:31,267
Don't move. - You got me.

464
00:42:33,347 --> 00:42:34,591
Nice potato gun.

465
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:36,833
Barrel's a little long.

466
00:42:36,833 --> 00:42:44,124
Between that and the wide gauge,
it's going to diminish your FPS

467
00:42:44,764 --> 00:42:48,225
And now you're out of ammo.
- What's that thing on your chest?

468
00:42:49,738 --> 00:42:53,771
It's a electromagnet. You should know,
you've got a box of them right here.

469
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:55,546
What does it power?

470
00:43:04,395 --> 00:43:05,730
Oh my God!

471
00:43:11,197 --> 00:43:14,802
Is that Iron Man? - Technically, I am.

472
00:43:14,802 --> 00:43:17,882
Technically, you're dead.

473
00:43:19,195 --> 00:43:21,939
A valid point. - What happened to him?

474
00:43:21,939 --> 00:43:24,683
Life. I built him; I take care of him.

475
00:43:27,598 --> 00:43:29,683
I'll fix him.

476
00:43:29,683 --> 00:43:30,846
Like a mechanic. - Yeah.

477
00:43:33,301 --> 00:43:35,769
If I was building Iron Man and War Machine,

478
00:43:35,769 --> 00:43:38,240
It's Iron Patriot now. - That's way cooler!

479
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,401
No, it's not.

480
00:43:39,777 --> 00:43:43,374
Anyway, I would have added in the retro-

481
00:43:43,374 --> 00:43:46,176
Retroreflective panels? - To make him stealth mode.

482
00:43:46,176 --> 00:43:47,508
You want a stealth mode? - Cool, right?

483
00:43:47,508 --> 00:43:49,436
That's actually a good idea.
Maybe I'll build one.

484
00:43:50,913 --> 00:43:52,318
Not a good idea!

485
00:43:52,318 --> 00:43:56,306
What are you doing? You're going to break his finger?
He's in pain; he's been injured. Leave him alone.

486
00:43:56,627 --> 00:43:58,196
Sorry. - Are you?

487
00:44:00,072 --> 00:44:01,863
Don't worry about it; I'll fix it.

488
00:44:02,437 --> 00:44:08,758
So, uh, who's home? - Well, my mom already left for
the diner and dad went to 7-11 to get scratchers.

489
00:44:09,144 --> 00:44:12,052
I guess he won 'cause that was six years ago.

490
00:44:14,659 --> 00:44:21,258
Which happens, dads leave. No need to
be a pussy about it. Here's what I need:
a laptop, a digital watch, a cell phone,

491
00:44:21,258 --> 00:44:27,211
The pneumatic actuator from your bazooka over there,
a map of town, a big spring, and a tunafish sandwich.

492
00:44:27,211 --> 00:44:31,121
What's in it for me? - Salvation. What's his name?

493
00:44:31,493 --> 00:44:34,382
Who?
- The kid that bullies you at school, what's his name?

494
00:44:34,647 --> 00:44:37,164
How'd you know that?

495
00:44:38,007 --> 00:44:39,685
I got just the thing.

496
00:44:41,947 --> 00:44:49,323
This is a pinata for a cricket. I'm kidding;
it's a very powerful weapon. Point it away
from your face, press the button on top,

497
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:51,561
It discourages bullying.

498
00:44:51,964 --> 00:44:54,413
Non-lethal

499
00:44:54,684 --> 00:44:59,412
Deal. Deal? What'd you say? - Deal.

500
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,713
What's your name? - Harley

501
00:45:03,273 --> 00:45:05,243
And you're? - The mechanic

502
00:45:06,365 --> 00:45:07,716
Tony

503
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:11,224
You know what keeps going through my head?

504
00:45:11,734 --> 00:45:14,574
Where's my sandwich?

505
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:55,499
Stark Secure Server - Retinal scan verified.

506
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,044
Pepper, it's me.

507
00:45:58,335 --> 00:46:01,853
I've got a lot of apologies to make and not a lot of time,
so first off

508
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:06,883
I'm so sorry I put you in harm's way.
That was selfish and stupid and it won't happen again.

509
00:46:07,724 --> 00:46:15,913
Why were you at the house tonight?
What was so important that you had to speak to Tony?

510
00:46:16,408 --> 00:46:20,413
I think that my boss is working for the Mandarin.

511
00:46:20,949 --> 00:46:26,413
So if you still want to talk about it,
I suggest we get ourselves someplace safe

512
00:46:26,413 --> 00:46:32,914
Your boss works for the Mandarin you think,
but Tony says you're a botanist

513
00:46:32,914 --> 00:46:40,938
That figures. What I actually am is a biological DNA
coder running a team of 40 out of a privately-funded
think tank, but sure you can call me a "botanist"

514
00:46:42,269 --> 00:46:48,413
This boss of yours, does he have a name?
Yeah, Aldrich Killian.

515
00:46:50,221 --> 00:46:53,264
Well we took the house down sir,
but there's no sign of a body.

516
00:46:53,264 --> 00:46:54,675
I see. - No Stark.

517
00:46:54,675 --> 00:46:55,848
I have to go.

518
00:46:56,883 --> 00:46:59,304
The Master is about to record and he's a little...

519
00:47:00,003 --> 00:47:01,350
Well you know how he gets.

520
00:47:01,726 --> 00:47:04,642
Keep your appointment tonight
and call me when it's done.

521
00:47:10,708 --> 00:47:16,578
Alright everybody. No talking and no eye contact,
unless you wanna get shot in the face.

522
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:37,686
The Master is travelling.

523
00:47:52,062 --> 00:47:54,060
Well then, what are we waiting for?

524
00:47:57,213 --> 00:48:01,608
The sandwich was fair, the spring was a little rusty,
the rest of the materials I'll make do

525
00:48:01,829 --> 00:48:05,561
By the way, when you said your sister had a watch,
I was kinda hoping for something a little more than that

526
00:48:07,236 --> 00:48:10,461
She's six! Anyway, it's limited edition.

527
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:13,445
When can we talk about New York?
- Maybe never, relax about it.

528
00:48:13,445 --> 00:48:17,412
What about the Avengers, can you talk about them?
- I don't know; later.

529
00:48:17,412 --> 00:48:18,442
Hey kid, give me more space.

530
00:48:22,104 --> 00:48:25,661
What's the official story here? What happened?

531
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:29,918
I guess this guy named Chad Davis,
used to live roundabouts

532
00:48:31,315 --> 00:48:33,707
Won a bunch of medals in the army,

533
00:48:34,044 --> 00:48:38,095
One day, folks said he went crazy and made,
you know, a bomb

534
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:43,413
Then he blew himself up right here.

535
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:49,026
Six people died, right? - Yes.

536
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:50,675
Including Chad Davis? - Yea.

537
00:48:57,368 --> 00:49:00,300
Doesn't make sense.

538
00:49:01,649 --> 00:49:05,190
Think about it. Six dead, only five shadows.

539
00:49:05,673 --> 00:49:10,912
Yeah, but people said these shadows are
like the mark of souls gone to Heaven

540
00:49:11,475 --> 00:49:16,912
Except the bomb guy,
he went to Hell on account of he didn't get a shadow.

541
00:49:17,266 --> 00:49:20,413
That's why there's only five - Do you buy that?

542
00:49:20,413 --> 00:49:23,412
That's what everyone says.

543
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:29,516
You know what this crater reminds me of?
- I have no idea; I don't care.

544
00:49:30,637 --> 00:49:37,392
That giant wormhole, in um, in New York.

545
00:49:38,198 --> 00:49:40,261
Does it remind you?
- That's manipulative. I don't want to talk about it.

546
00:49:40,617 --> 00:49:44,722
Are they coming back? The aliens?
- Maybe, can you stop?

547
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:47,645
Remember when I told you that I have an anxiety issue?

548
00:49:47,645 --> 00:49:50,035
Does this subject make you edgy? - Yeah, a little bit.

549
00:49:50,035 --> 00:49:56,220
Can I just catch my breath for a second?
- Are there bad guys in Rose Hills?
Do you need a plastic bag to breathe into?

550
00:49:57,185 --> 00:49:58,755
Do you have medication?
- Nope.

551
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,376
Do you need to be on it?
- Probably.

552
00:50:00,376 --> 00:50:02,413
Do you have PTSD?
- I don't think so.

553
00:50:02,413 --> 00:50:06,112
Are you going completely mental?
I can stop, do you want me to stop?

554
00:50:06,112 --> 00:50:10,413
Remember when I said to stop doing that?
I swear to God, you're going to freak me out.

555
00:50:11,854 --> 00:50:16,164
Ah man, you did it, didn't you? You happy now?
- What did I say?

556
00:50:16,164 --> 00:50:19,476
Hey, wait up! Wait, wait.

557
00:50:24,733 --> 00:50:33,413
What the hell was that?
- Your fault, you spazzed me out.

558
00:50:34,209 --> 00:50:36,213
Okay, back to business. Where were we?

559
00:50:36,439 --> 00:50:41,214
The guy who died... relatives?
Mom? Ms. Davis, where is she?

560
00:50:42,713 --> 00:50:45,712
Where she always is. - See, now you're being helpful.

561
00:50:49,874 --> 00:50:55,413
Sorry. Lady, this uh,

562
00:50:57,913 --> 00:51:02,322
Thank you - Nice haircut, suits you.

563
00:51:04,912 --> 00:51:07,413
Nice watch. - Yeah, limited edition.

564
00:51:07,413 --> 00:51:08,900
Oh, I don't doubt it.

565
00:51:10,256 --> 00:51:11,914
Well have a good evening.

566
00:51:34,901 --> 00:51:38,536
Ms. Davis,
Mind if I join you?

567
00:51:39,293 --> 00:51:41,842
Free country.
- It sure is.

568
00:51:46,542 --> 00:51:47,664
Alright

569
00:51:49,307 --> 00:51:53,576
Where'd you like to start?
- I just want to say I'm sorry about your loss.

570
00:51:54,729 --> 00:51:56,761
I want to know what you think happened

571
00:51:58,458 --> 00:52:03,861
I brought your damn file. You take it and go.

572
00:52:04,396 --> 00:52:07,484
Whatever was in here, he wanted no part of it.

573
00:52:09,714 --> 00:52:13,658
Clearly, you were waiting for someone else.
Supposed to meet somebody here?

574
00:52:13,658 --> 00:52:14,667
Yeah.

575
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:37,065
Ms. Davis, your son didn't kill himself; I guarantee
you he didn't kill anyone. Someone used him.

576
00:52:37,413 --> 00:52:41,178
What? - As a weapon

577
00:52:44,067 --> 00:52:47,529
You're not the person who called me after all, are you?

578
00:52:48,570 --> 00:52:50,183
Actually, I am.

579
00:52:54,156 --> 00:52:57,153
Hey, hey! What's all this about?
The hell's going on here?

580
00:52:57,153 --> 00:52:58,861
It's called an arrest.

581
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:02,971
Sheriff, is it? - Yes ma'am, it is. And you are?

582
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:07,413
Homeland Security. We good here?
- No, we're not good.

583
00:53:07,413 --> 00:53:11,413
I need a little more information than that.
- Well, I think it's a little above your pay grade, Sheriff.

584
00:53:11,413 --> 00:53:15,713
Yeah, well, why don't you get on the
horn to Nashville and upgrade me?

585
00:53:15,933 --> 00:53:19,293
Alright, you know what,
I was hoping to do this the smart way, but uh,

586
00:53:20,493 --> 00:53:22,653
The fun way's always good

587
00:53:23,052 --> 00:53:24,252
Deputy, get this woman and-

588
00:53:38,333 --> 00:53:41,052
Hey hot wings, you wanna party? You and me, let's go.

589
00:53:53,172 --> 00:53:56,574
Crazy, huh? - Yeah.

590
00:53:58,733 --> 00:54:01,773
Watch this.

591
00:55:05,373 --> 00:55:08,213
You walked right into this one;
I've dated hotter chicks than you.

592
00:55:10,253 --> 00:55:14,493
That's all you got? Cheap trick and a cheesy one-liner?

593
00:55:14,493 --> 00:55:16,854
Sweetheart, that could be the
name of my autobiography.

594
00:56:18,853 --> 00:56:20,893
Let me go! - Help me! Help me!

595
00:56:24,694 --> 00:56:30,773
Hey kid, what would you like for Christmas?
- Mr. Stark, I am so sorry.

596
00:56:30,773 --> 00:56:33,813
No, no,
I think he was trying to say "I want my goddamn file."

597
00:56:34,734 --> 00:56:36,694
It's not your fault kid.

598
00:56:37,293 --> 00:56:39,933
Remember what I told you about bullies?

599
00:56:46,453 --> 00:56:49,853
You like that, West World?
That's the thing about smart guys

600
00:56:50,412 --> 00:56:52,533
We always cover our ass.

601
00:57:16,692 --> 00:57:18,572
You're welcome!

602
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:22,413
For what? Did I miss something? - Me saving your life.

603
00:57:23,413 --> 00:57:25,913
A: Saved you first, B: Thanks, sort of

604
00:57:26,454 --> 00:57:31,293
And C: If you do someone a solid,
don't be a yutz alright, just play it
cool otherwise you come off grandiose

605
00:57:31,693 --> 00:57:33,133
Unlike you?

606
00:57:36,054 --> 00:57:39,094
Admit it: you need me. We're connected.

607
00:57:39,333 --> 00:57:43,853
What I need is for you to go home, be with your mom,
keep your mouth shut, and protect the suit.

608
00:57:43,853 --> 00:57:46,573
And stay connected to the telephone
because if I call you better pick up. Okay?

609
00:57:46,573 --> 00:57:49,973
Can you feel that? We're done here.

610
00:57:50,334 --> 00:57:52,974
Move out of the way or I'm going to run you over.
Bye kid.

611
00:58:00,213 --> 00:58:06,373
I'm sorry kid. You did good. - So now you're
just going to leave you here, like my dad?

612
00:58:08,253 --> 00:58:13,533
Yeah. Wait, you're guilt-tripping me, aren't you?
- I'm cold

613
00:58:13,774 --> 00:58:16,013
I can tell. You know how I can tell?

614
00:58:17,733 --> 00:58:18,973
'Cause we're connected.

615
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:25,453
It was worth a shot.

616
00:58:43,374 --> 00:58:48,813
What happened to the picture?

617
00:58:54,773 --> 00:58:57,293
The entire East coast... the satellites are down.

618
00:58:57,973 --> 00:59:00,054
We have an unauthorized broadcast

619
00:59:02,412 --> 00:59:03,654
Mr. Vice President, I think you should see this

620
00:59:07,173 --> 00:59:10,653
Oh my God, not again. Is the President getting this?

621
00:59:21,093 --> 00:59:23,293
Mr. President

622
00:59:23,293 --> 00:59:25,092
Only two lessons remain.

623
00:59:25,774 --> 00:59:28,572
I intend to finish this before Christmas morning.

624
00:59:29,814 --> 00:59:34,253
Meet Thomas Richards.
Good strong name, good strong job.

625
00:59:35,613 --> 00:59:40,213
Thomas here is an accountant
for the Roxxon Oil Corporation

626
00:59:43,613 --> 00:59:45,534
And I'm sure he's a really good guy.

627
00:59:48,773 --> 00:59:53,573
I'm going to shoot him in the head,
live on your television, in 30 seconds.

628
00:59:54,454 --> 00:59:59,053
The number for this telephone is in your cell phone.
Exciting, isn't it?

629
00:59:59,333 --> 01:00:01,413
Imagining how it got there

630
01:00:01,912 --> 01:00:08,133
America, if your president calls me
in the next half-minute, Tom lives.

631
01:00:08,133 --> 01:00:09,093
Go.

632
01:00:11,374 --> 01:00:14,533
How did he hack my phone?
- We can't allow terrorists to dictate-

633
01:00:14,533 --> 01:00:17,333
I have to make this call.
- I'd strongly advise against that.

634
01:00:17,333 --> 01:00:18,933
This is the right thing to do.

635
01:00:46,813 --> 01:00:51,492
There's just one lesson left, President Ellis,
so run away and kiss your children goodbye

636
01:00:51,492 --> 01:00:55,533
Because nothing, not your army, not your red, white,
and blue attack dog, can save you.

637
01:00:59,173 --> 01:01:00,373
I'll see you soon.

638
01:01:03,213 --> 01:01:08,693
Tell Rhodes, find this lunatic right now
- Sir, we tracked the broadcast signal.

639
01:01:08,693 --> 01:01:12,454
We have a possible point of origin in Pakistan and
the Patriot is ready to strike. - Right now! - Yes, sir.

640
01:01:44,094 --> 01:01:45,053
Don't move!

641
01:01:52,253 --> 01:01:53,254
Uh, hang on a second.

642
01:01:54,293 --> 01:02:00,852
Hello. - You ever look up and everything starts
glowing from the inside out, a kind of bright orange

643
01:02:00,852 --> 01:02:03,294
Yeah, I've had that. Who is this? - It's me, pal.

644
01:02:03,294 --> 01:02:06,493
Now last time I went missing,
if I remember correctly, you went looking for me.

645
01:02:06,493 --> 01:02:09,414
What are you doing? A little talking,
making friends in Pakistan. - What are you doing?

646
01:02:10,494 --> 01:02:14,893
Your re-design, your big re-brand, that was AIM, right?
- Yeah.

647
01:02:14,893 --> 01:02:18,573
I'm gonna find a heavy-duty comsat right now,
I need your login.

648
01:02:18,913 --> 01:02:21,813
Same as it's always been, War Machine 68.
- And password please?

649
01:02:21,813 --> 01:02:28,332
Well, look, I gotta change it every time you
hack in, Tony - It's not the eighties, nobody
says "hack" anymore, give me your login.

650
01:02:28,853 --> 01:02:32,613
"War Machine Rox" with an X, all caps.

651
01:02:35,413 --> 01:02:39,613
Yeah okay. - That is so much better than Iron Patriot.

652
01:03:21,503 --> 01:03:24,343
That ain't gonna cut it.

653
01:03:26,423 --> 01:03:28,583
Excuse me sir, I don't know who...

654
01:03:31,303 --> 01:03:33,983
Mom, I need to call you back,
something magical is happening.

655
01:03:34,703 --> 01:03:38,623
Tony Stark is in my van. - Keep it down.
- Tony Stark is in my van! - No, he's not.

656
01:03:38,623 --> 01:03:41,663
I knew you were still alive!
- Come on in and close the door.

657
01:03:46,703 --> 01:03:48,264
Wow, can I just say sir? - Yeah.

658
01:03:49,583 --> 01:03:53,064
I am your biggest fan.
- First, is this your van or is anyone else gonna come in?

659
01:03:53,064 --> 01:03:55,383
No, no, it's just us. - What's your name?

660
01:03:55,383 --> 01:03:56,623
Gary. - Gary. - Oh wow.

661
01:03:58,903 --> 01:04:04,262
Right there's fine. I get a lot of this, it's okay.
- Can I just say?

662
01:04:04,262 --> 01:04:08,024
Yeah. - I don't know if you can tell but I have like

663
01:04:08,544 --> 01:04:14,183
Patterned my whole look after you. My hair's a little,
it's not right because there's some product in it

664
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:14,343
Right.

665
01:04:16,103 --> 01:04:20,623
I don't want to make things awkward for you
- No. - But I do have to show you... boom!

666
01:04:21,864 --> 01:04:23,263
Hispanic Scott Baio?

667
01:04:24,503 --> 01:04:26,063
Oh, I'm sorry, is that me? - Yeah.

668
01:04:26,463 --> 01:04:31,904
It's... I mean. I had them do it off a doll that I made,
so it's not like it's off a picture. So it's a little bit-

669
01:04:32,383 --> 01:04:34,903
Jerry, for a moment, listen to me here.

670
01:04:35,823 --> 01:04:39,463
I don't want to clip your wings here;
we're both a little over-excited.

671
01:04:39,783 --> 01:04:43,383
I have an issue. I'm chasing bad guys, trying to grapple
with something from some hard-crypt data files.

672
01:04:43,383 --> 01:04:45,703
I don't have enough juice.

673
01:04:46,063 --> 01:04:49,862
I need you to jump on the roof, recalibrate the ISDNs

674
01:04:50,463 --> 01:04:54,183
Pump it up by about 40 %.
- Got it. - Alright, it's a mission.

675
01:04:54,183 --> 01:04:56,544
Tony needs Gary

676
01:04:57,344 --> 01:04:59,342
and Gary needs Tony - Be quiet about it.

677
01:04:59,543 --> 01:05:00,643
Go.

678
01:05:23,223 --> 01:05:26,144
What would you regard as the
defining moment of your life?

679
01:05:26,463 --> 01:05:30,103
Well uh, I think that would be the day
I decided not to let my injury beat me.

680
01:05:32,463 --> 01:05:35,384
Can you please state your name for the camera?
- Ellen Brandt.

681
01:05:35,703 --> 01:05:40,064
Okay, so, the injections are administered periodically.

682
01:05:40,064 --> 01:05:44,544
Addiction will not be tolerated and those who
cannot regulate will be cut from the program.

683
01:05:45,744 --> 01:05:52,824
Once misfits, cripples...
you are the next iteration of human evolution.

684
01:05:57,104 --> 01:06:05,143
Hi everybody. Before we start, I promise you,
looking back at your life there will be nothing
as bitter as the memory of that glorious
risk that you prudently elected to forego

685
01:06:06,643 --> 01:06:08,864
Today is your glory. Let's begin!

686
01:06:20,183 --> 01:06:23,063
We gotta get out of here! Gotta get out of here!
Get 'em out! Get 'em out of here!

687
01:06:30,063 --> 01:06:32,424
A bomb is not a bomb when it's a misfire

688
01:06:34,863 --> 01:06:37,143
This stuff doesn't always work, right, pal?

689
01:06:38,143 --> 01:06:39,643
It's faulty, but you found a buyer, didn't ya?

690
01:06:40,184 --> 01:06:44,103
Sold it to the Mandarin.

691
01:06:47,743 --> 01:06:51,062
What happened? Fun fact

692
01:06:52,064 --> 01:06:54,824
Before he built rockets for the Nazis

693
01:06:55,183 --> 01:07:04,142
The idealistic Werner von Braun
dreamed of space travel... he stargazed

694
01:07:05,183 --> 01:07:09,143
You know what he said when the first V2 hit London?

695
01:07:09,863 --> 01:07:13,183
The rocket performed perfectly

696
01:07:14,984 --> 01:07:17,264
It just landed on the wrong planet.

697
01:07:18,983 --> 01:07:23,863
See we all begin wide-eyed... "pure science"

698
01:07:24,383 --> 01:07:28,623
Then the ego steps in, the obsession

699
01:07:30,183 --> 01:07:36,422
And when you look up, you're a long way from shore

700
01:07:37,183 --> 01:07:43,583
You can't be too hard on yourself, Maya.
I mean you gave your research to a think tank.

701
01:07:43,583 --> 01:07:48,983
Yeah but Killian built that think tank on military
contracts - That's exactly what we used to do

702
01:07:49,544 --> 01:07:51,104
So don't judge yourself

703
01:07:53,063 --> 01:07:54,542
Thank you, Pepper.

704
01:07:56,463 --> 01:07:57,983
I really appreciate that.

705
01:08:05,863 --> 01:08:07,343
Hi, good evening - Good evening. - Come on in.

706
01:08:10,022 --> 01:08:11,183
Maya, run!

707
01:08:13,503 --> 01:08:14,623
Hi Pepper.

708
01:08:16,863 --> 01:08:18,662
So you want to tell me why you
were at Stark's manison last night?

709
01:08:19,143 --> 01:08:22,142
I'm trying to fix this thing. I didn't know you
and the Master were gonna blow the place up.

710
01:08:23,063 --> 01:08:29,264
Oh I see, so you were trying to save Stark... when he
threatened us - I told you, Killian, we can use him.

711
01:08:30,303 --> 01:08:35,144
Pepper, Pepper, Pepper - Look if we want
to launch product next year, I need Stark.

712
01:08:35,504 --> 01:08:36,301
He just lacked a decent incentive. Now he has one.

713
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:48,600
This is Support Team Blue 0, sending coordinates
for suspected Mandarin broadcast point of origin.

714
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:49,176
Copy.

715
01:08:57,504 --> 01:08:58,583
Nobody move!

716
01:09:03,504 --> 01:09:09,663
Support Blue 0, unless the Mandarin's next
attack on the U.S. involves cheaply-made
sportswear, I think you messed up again.

717
01:09:11,183 --> 01:09:16,142
Yes, you're free, if you weren't before. Yes ma'am

718
01:09:16,343 --> 01:09:20,103
Iron Patriot on the job, happy to help,
no need to thank me, it's my pleasure.

719
01:09:29,144 --> 01:09:31,644
Savin, I've acquired the Patriot armor.

720
01:09:31,644 --> 01:09:35,583
You want this suit? You're going ot have to pry my cold,
dead body out of it.

721
01:09:35,583 --> 01:09:37,063
That's the plan, Colonel.

722
01:09:38,702 --> 01:09:45,063
Harley, tell me what is happening, give me
a full report - Yeah, I'm still eating that
candy, do you want me to keep eating it?

723
01:09:45,063 --> 01:09:47,063
How much did you have? - Two or three bowls.

724
01:09:47,063 --> 01:09:49,943
Can you still see straight? - Sort of.
- That means you're fine, give me Jarvis.

725
01:09:51,783 --> 01:09:57,863
Jarvis, how are we? - It's totally fine sir. I seem
to do quite well for a stretch and then at the
end of the sentence I say the wrong cranberry.

726
01:09:58,543 --> 01:10:05,183
And sir, you were right. Once I factored in
available AIM downlink facilities I was able
to pinpoint the Mandarin's broadcast signal.

727
01:10:05,183 --> 01:10:09,583
What're we talkin'? The Far East, Europe,
North Africa, Iran, Pakistan, Syria, where is it?

728
01:10:09,583 --> 01:10:12,503
Actually, sir, it's in Miami.

729
01:10:12,503 --> 01:10:18,143
Okay, kid, I'm going to have to walk you
through rebooting Jarvis' speech drive, but
not right now. Harley, where is he really?

730
01:10:18,143 --> 01:10:19,823
Just look on the screen and tell me where it is.

731
01:10:21,583 --> 01:10:25,583
It does say Miami, Florida
- Okay, first things first, I need the armor.

732
01:10:25,823 --> 01:10:28,263
Where are we at with it? - Uh, it's not charging.

733
01:10:35,983 --> 01:10:41,503
Actually, sir, it is charging,
but the power source is questionable.
It may not succeed in revitalizing the Mark 42.

734
01:10:41,503 --> 01:10:46,903
What's questionable about electricity?
Alright, it's my suit and I can't... I'm not gonna...

735
01:10:47,943 --> 01:10:51,303
Oh God, not again. - Tony

736
01:10:53,264 --> 01:11:00,263
Are you having another attack? I didn't even
mention New York. - Right, and then you just
said it, by name, while denying having said it.

737
01:11:00,263 --> 01:11:01,443
Okay, um, uh

738
01:11:04,184 --> 01:11:07,943
Oh God, what am I gonna do?
- Just breathe, really just breathe

739
01:11:09,143 --> 01:11:12,663
You're a mechanic, right? - Right.

740
01:11:13,863 --> 01:11:17,222
You said so. - Yes, I did.

741
01:11:18,182 --> 01:11:20,223
What don't you just build something?

742
01:11:33,023 --> 01:11:35,823
Okay, thanks kid.

743
01:13:19,783 --> 01:13:24,023
Why is it so hot in here? I told you to put it at 68.

744
01:13:24,823 --> 01:13:28,623
My fault again... let me tell you something sweetheart,
I am not your personal-

745
01:14:31,703 --> 01:14:33,584
I wouldn't go in there for twenty minutes!

746
01:14:35,303 --> 01:14:38,423
Now, which one of you is Vanessa?

747
01:14:39,643 --> 01:14:41,144
Ah, Nessie

748
01:14:47,623 --> 01:14:47,623
Did you know that fortune cookies aren't even Chinese?
- There's some guy over here-

749
01:14:47,623 --> 01:14:51,144
They're made by Americans,
based on the Japanese recipes

750
01:14:54,104 --> 01:14:56,903
Hey! - Bloody hell, bloody hell - Don't move.

751
01:14:56,903 --> 01:15:02,103
If you want something, take it, although the
guns are all fake because those wankers
wouldn't trust me with the real ones.

752
01:15:02,103 --> 01:15:04,583
What? - Hey, do you fancy either of the birds?

753
01:15:06,143 --> 01:15:10,583
You're not him, the Mandarin, the real guy, where?!

754
01:15:10,583 --> 01:15:14,903
Where's the Mandarin?! Where is he?!
- He's here. He's here.

755
01:15:15,223 --> 01:15:18,023
But he's not here. He's here but he's not here.
- What do you mean?

756
01:15:18,023 --> 01:15:21,743
It's complicated, hey, it's complicated, alright?
- It is? - It's complicated.

757
01:15:21,743 --> 01:15:24,622
Uncomplicate it. Ladies out,
get out of the bed, get in the bathroom.

758
01:15:27,371 --> 01:15:27,980
Sit.

759
01:15:37,822 --> 01:15:42,344
My name is Trevor, Trevor Slattery. - What are you?

760
01:15:43,503 --> 01:15:47,383
What're you a decoy? You're a double, right?
- What? No. An understudy? Absolutely not.

761
01:15:48,143 --> 01:15:49,983
Don't hurt me please! I'm an actor.

762
01:15:51,782 --> 01:15:57,824
You got a minute to live, fill it with words.
- It's just a role. "The Mandarin", see, it's not real.

763
01:15:58,143 --> 01:15:59,743
Then how did you get here, Trevor?

764
01:16:02,423 --> 01:16:12,823
Um, well, uh, I have a little problem
with, um, substances, and I ended up
doing things... no two ways about it

765
01:16:12,823 --> 01:16:16,103
In the street that a man shouldn't do - Next!

766
01:16:16,103 --> 01:16:21,503
Then, they approached me about the
role and they knew about the drugs

767
01:16:21,503 --> 01:16:24,143
What'd they say they'd get you off them?
- Said they'd give me more

768
01:16:24,503 --> 01:16:30,823
They gave me things. They gave me this palace.
They gave me plastic surgery. They gave me things.

769
01:16:32,543 --> 01:16:33,943
Did you just nod off?

770
01:16:35,103 --> 01:16:39,183
No, the lovely speedboat!
And the thing was, he needed someone

771
01:16:39,584 --> 01:16:43,184
To take credit for some "accidental explosions"

772
01:16:46,742 --> 01:16:47,583
"He"?

773
01:16:50,222 --> 01:16:52,423
Killian? - Killian.

774
01:16:52,423 --> 01:16:54,744
He created you? - He created me.

775
01:16:55,944 --> 01:16:58,143
Custom-made terror threat - Yes!

776
01:16:58,823 --> 01:17:03,743
Yes, his think tank thinked it up,
the pathology of the serial killer

777
01:17:04,183 --> 01:17:07,223
The manipulation of Western iconography

778
01:17:07,663 --> 01:17:11,864
Ready for another lesson? Blah blah blah.

779
01:17:13,663 --> 01:17:16,622
Of course, it was my performance
that brought the Mandarin to life.

780
01:17:16,843 --> 01:17:22,183
Your performance? Where people die?

781
01:17:23,143 --> 01:17:25,643
No, no, look around you, costumes, green screen

782
01:17:25,943 --> 01:17:30,183
Honestly, I wasn't on location for half this stuff,
and when I was, movie magic, love

783
01:17:30,423 --> 01:17:33,863
I'm sorry but I got a best friend who's
in a coma and he might not wake up

784
01:17:33,863 --> 01:17:37,343
So you're going to have to answer for that.
You're still going down, pal.

785
01:17:44,222 --> 01:17:49,103
Okay, Trevor, what'd you tell him?
- I didn't tell him anything.

786
01:17:49,103 --> 01:17:50,823
Nothing?

787
01:17:50,823 --> 01:17:53,543
No. - You should have pressed the panic button.

788
01:17:54,383 --> 01:17:56,423
Well I panicked, but then I handled it.

789
01:18:19,503 --> 01:18:23,503
Just like old times, huh?
- Oh yeah, with zip-ties. It's a ball.

790
01:18:24,183 --> 01:18:27,903
It wasn't my idea. - Okay, so you took Killian's card

791
01:18:27,903 --> 01:18:31,663
I took his money
- and here you are 13 years later in a dungeon

792
01:18:31,663 --> 01:18:32,144
No. - Yeah.

793
01:18:32,843 --> 01:18:35,263
No, you're in a dungeon. I'm free to go. - Yeah...

794
01:18:40,743 --> 01:18:44,193
A lot's happened Tony and I'm close.

795
01:18:45,383 --> 01:18:48,783
Extremis is pratically stable. - I'm telling you it isn't.

796
01:18:48,783 --> 01:18:52,743
I saw him on the street, people are going 'bang',
they're painting the walls. Maya, you're kidding yourself.

797
01:18:52,743 --> 01:18:57,423
Then help me fix it.

798
01:18:59,262 --> 01:19:00,263
Did I do that?

799
01:19:02,423 --> 01:19:04,823
Yes. - I remember the night, not the morning

800
01:19:05,544 --> 01:19:07,902
Is this what you've been chasing around?
- You don't remember? - I can't help you.

801
01:19:10,023 --> 01:19:15,223
You used to have a moral psychology.
You used to have ideals.

802
01:19:16,143 --> 01:19:19,983
Wanted to help people, now look at you.

803
01:19:21,583 --> 01:19:27,903
I get to wake up every morning with someone who...
still has a soul.

804
01:19:34,104 --> 01:19:38,703
Get me out of here, come on

805
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:45,623
You know what my old man used to say to me?
His favorite of many sayings

806
01:19:46,583 --> 01:19:51,102
"The early bird gets the worm;
the second mouse gets the cheese"

807
01:19:51,102 --> 01:19:55,063
You're not still pissed about the Switzerland thing,
are you? - How can I be pissed you, Tony?

808
01:19:55,782 --> 01:20:00,223
You've given me the greatest gift
that anybody's ever given me.

809
01:20:00,983 --> 01:20:06,343
Desperation. If you think back to Switzerland,
you said you'd meet me on the rooftop, right?

810
01:20:07,824 --> 01:20:18,702
Well for the first 20 minutes, I actually thought
you'd show up. For the next hour, I uhh

811
01:20:18,702 --> 01:20:22,663
Well I considered taking that one step
shortcut to the lobby, if you know I mean

812
01:20:22,663 --> 01:20:25,584
Honestly, I'm still trying to figure out
what happened to the first mouse.

813
01:20:26,023 --> 01:20:31,223
But as I looked out over that city, nobody knew I was
there, nobody could see me, no one was even looking

814
01:20:31,223 --> 01:20:37,264
I had a thought that would guide me for years to come.

815
01:20:38,183 --> 01:20:39,503
Anonymity, Tony.

816
01:20:40,983 --> 01:20:46,463
Thanks to you, it's been my mantra ever since, right?
You simply rule from behind the scenes.

817
01:20:46,463 --> 01:20:48,783
Because the second you give evil a face

818
01:20:49,343 --> 01:20:52,903
Bin Laden, Gaddafi, The Mandarin

819
01:20:53,184 --> 01:20:55,303
You hand the people a target - You're something else

820
01:20:58,303 --> 01:21:00,903
You have met him, I assume?
- Yeah, Sir Lawrence Oblivion.

821
01:21:01,183 --> 01:21:04,344
I know he's a little over the top sometimes...
it's not entirely my fault

822
01:21:04,344 --> 01:21:06,504
He has a tend... he's a stage actor.

823
01:21:07,303 --> 01:21:09,863
They say his Lear was the toast of Croydon,
wherever that is.

824
01:21:10,463 --> 01:21:14,862
Anyway, the point is ever since that big
dude with the hammer fell out of the sky

825
01:21:15,743 --> 01:21:17,544
Subtlety's kinda had its day

826
01:21:17,863 --> 01:21:19,423
What's next for you in your world?

827
01:21:19,423 --> 01:21:24,264
Well, I wanted to repay you for the same
gift you so graciously imparted to me

828
01:21:31,743 --> 01:21:36,582
Desperation. Now, this is live.
I'm not sure if you can tell

829
01:21:37,103 --> 01:21:44,623
But at this moment the body is trying to decide
whether to accept Extremis or just give up

830
01:21:45,144 --> 01:21:49,063
And if it gives up,
I have to say the denotation is quite spectactular

831
01:21:50,383 --> 01:21:53,103
But until that point, it's really just a lot of pain.

832
01:21:53,822 --> 01:21:58,303
We haven't even talked salary yet.

833
01:21:58,303 --> 01:22:03,424
What kind of perk package are you thinking of?
- Let him go.

834
01:22:04,182 --> 01:22:09,343
Hold on, hold on. Maya - I said let him go

835
01:22:10,023 --> 01:22:14,503
What are you doing?
- 1200ccs, a dose half of this size and I'm dead

836
01:22:14,982 --> 01:22:18,624
It's times like this my temper is tested somewhat

837
01:22:18,624 --> 01:22:20,703
Maya, give me the injector.

838
01:22:20,703 --> 01:22:26,143
If I die Killian, what happens to your soldiers?
What happens to your product?

839
01:22:26,143 --> 01:22:29,783
We're not doing this, okay? - What happens to you?
What happens if you go too hot?

840
01:22:43,303 --> 01:22:47,703
The good news is,
a high level position has just been vacated

841
01:22:57,024 --> 01:22:59,343
You're a maniac. - No, I'm a visionary

842
01:23:00,903 --> 01:23:05,463
But I do own a maniac, and he takes the stage tonight

843
01:23:09,783 --> 01:23:13,024
When we get the Iron Patriot,
it'll take me nine to ten minutes to disassemble it.

844
01:23:14,063 --> 01:23:16,583
That's great.
The last time I looked there was somebody inside of it.

845
01:23:22,863 --> 01:23:24,504
Good evening, gentlemen

846
01:23:27,543 --> 01:23:30,222
Hello Colonel

847
01:23:30,222 --> 01:23:32,463
Step aside.

848
01:23:39,984 --> 01:23:44,823
We'll get you out of there, don't worry.
- You'll damage the armor.

849
01:23:45,302 --> 01:23:49,103
Yes, I will, but you can fix it, right?

850
01:23:50,383 --> 01:23:53,623
I'm going to take the suit up to base camp,
and I want Potts with me.

851
01:23:53,824 --> 01:23:55,943
She's still in Phase 2.

852
01:23:57,023 --> 01:23:59,543
You're not going deaf, are ya?

853
01:24:14,703 --> 01:24:16,783
Careful there, it's a limited edition.

854
01:24:17,304 --> 01:24:19,542
Hey, uh, ponytail express

855
01:24:19,983 --> 01:24:23,022
What is the mileage count between
Tennessee and Miami? - 832 miles

856
01:24:23,343 --> 01:24:25,383
Very nice.

857
01:24:26,943 --> 01:24:29,463
Are you gonna stop that? - Break it you bought it

858
01:24:32,224 --> 01:24:38,664
Okay, that wasn't mine to give away, that belongs to
my friend's sister, and that's why I'm gonna kill you first.

859
01:24:39,143 --> 01:24:40,263
What're ya gonna do to me? - You'll see.

860
01:24:40,663 --> 01:24:44,183
You're zip-tied to a bed. - This.

861
01:24:47,663 --> 01:24:49,103
That.

862
01:24:53,423 --> 01:24:56,664
Are you comin' out?

863
01:24:57,663 --> 01:25:01,823
Do not open, do not open, don't open,
don't open, don't- Alright, let's go.

864
01:25:09,103 --> 01:25:11,824
You breathe fire? Okay.

865
01:25:15,423 --> 01:25:18,423
It's a glorious day, Savin.

866
01:25:18,743 --> 01:25:24,384
This time tomorrow I'll have the West's
most powerful leader in one hand

867
01:25:24,384 --> 01:25:27,583
And the world's most feared terrorist in the other.

868
01:25:28,423 --> 01:25:30,543
I'll own the War on Terror

869
01:25:32,023 --> 01:25:36,904
Creates supply and demand for
you and your brothers and sisters.

870
01:25:40,063 --> 01:25:45,263
Trust me, you're going in a puddle of blood
on the ground in 5, 4, 3, Come on!, 2

871
01:25:47,823 --> 01:25:51,624
How did we get this shit? - Alright, I'm going to give
you a chance to escape, put down your weapons

872
01:25:52,623 --> 01:25:56,383
And tie yourselves into those chairs and I'll let you live.
In 5, 4

873
01:25:58,663 --> 01:26:02,223
You should be gone by now, you should have
already been gone. - I'm just beyond terrified.

874
01:26:02,223 --> 01:26:03,702
Here it comes.

875
01:26:04,103 --> 01:26:05,704
3, 4

876
01:26:05,704 --> 01:26:07,703
Shut up. - 54321

877
01:26:08,502 --> 01:26:09,702
I told you.

878
01:26:22,663 --> 01:26:23,704
Where's the rest?

879
01:27:20,943 --> 01:27:24,943
Honestly, I hate working here... they are so weird.

880
01:27:31,224 --> 01:27:32,463
Better late than never.

881
01:27:37,867 --> 01:27:39,626
Not this time. Not the face.

882
01:27:41,621 --> 01:27:44,711
Phew, it's good to be back. Hello, by the way.
- Oh, hello sir.

883
01:27:51,263 --> 01:27:56,983
All personnel, Stark is loose and somewhere
in the compound. Repeat: Stark is
loose and somewhere in the compound.

884
01:27:58,063 --> 01:27:59,623
Ah, crap.

885
01:28:11,623 --> 01:28:14,983
Tony - Rudy, tell me that was you in the suit.

886
01:28:15,303 --> 01:28:18,543
No, you got yours?
- Uh, um, kind of. Main house as fast as you can,

887
01:28:18,784 --> 01:28:20,063
Somebody I'd like you to meet

888
01:28:26,183 --> 01:28:28,603
You, you. Move! Get out!

889
01:28:28,603 --> 01:28:31,783
The room is secure. I have eyes on the Mandarin.
- What's this? I had winner's.

890
01:28:40,023 --> 01:28:43,464
What've you come as?
- Make a move and I'll break your face.

891
01:28:44,943 --> 01:28:48,423
I never thought people had been hurt. They lied to me.

892
01:28:49,104 --> 01:28:52,183
This is the Mandarin? - I know, it's, it's embarrassing.

893
01:28:52,183 --> 01:28:54,144
Hi, I'm Trevor, Trevor Slattery.

894
01:28:54,144 --> 01:29:01,623
I know I'm shorter in person, I'm a bit small, everyone
says that, but, uh, hey, if you're here to arrest
me, there are some people who I'd like to rat on

895
01:29:01,623 --> 01:29:04,623
Here's how it works,
you tell him where Pepper is and he'll stop doing it.

896
01:29:05,263 --> 01:29:08,583
Stop what? Well, I understand

897
01:29:08,583 --> 01:29:12,503
I do not know (Piper) but I know the plan

898
01:29:12,503 --> 01:29:14,664
Occur - Do you know what who did Bhlta?

899
01:29:15,023 --> 01:29:22,383
No, but Shaddt the beach when something related
to a large compound Bomkanni pick you up there

900
01:29:26,544 --> 01:29:29,064
Tony, I swear to God, I'm going to blow his face off.

901
01:29:29,064 --> 01:29:32,583
Oh this next bit may include the Vice President as well.

902
01:29:33,624 --> 01:29:36,664
Is that important? - Somewhat. - Yeah, a little bit.

903
01:29:42,423 --> 01:29:44,743
So? - Uh, what are we gonna do.
We don't have any transport.

904
01:29:46,662 --> 01:29:50,063
Hey, Ringo,
didn't you say something about a "lovely speedboat"?

905
01:29:52,782 --> 01:29:57,143
If he's right about the location, we're 20 minutes
from where Pepper is. - But we also have to
figure out this Vice President thing, right?

906
01:29:57,624 --> 01:30:00,463
I wonder who I'm calling right now.
Oh, that's the Vice President.

907
01:30:02,583 --> 01:30:04,902
Hello. - Sir, this is Tony Stark.

908
01:30:05,583 --> 01:30:10,944
Welcome back to the land of the living. - We
believe you're about to be drawn into the
Mandarin campaign, and we've got to get
you somewhere safe as soon as possible.

909
01:30:11,623 --> 01:30:14,703
Mr. Stark, I'm about to eat honey roast
ham surrounded by the agency's finest.

910
01:30:14,703 --> 01:30:18,203
And the President is safe on Air
Force One with Colonel Rhodes

911
01:30:19,302 --> 01:30:22,902
I think we're good here. - Sir, this is Colonel Rhodes!

912
01:30:23,143 --> 01:30:28,543
They're using the Iron Patriot as a trojan horse;
they're gonna take out the President somehow.
We have to immediately alert that plane.

913
01:30:28,543 --> 01:30:33,624
Okay, I'm on it. I'll have security lock it
down. If need be, they can have F22s in
the air in 30 seconds. Thank you, Colonel.

914
01:30:34,322 --> 01:30:35,215
Rhodes and Stark out.

915
01:30:37,423 --> 01:30:41,263
Everything okay, sir? - Couldn't be better.

916
01:30:48,144 --> 01:30:50,703
I love you, little one

917
01:31:10,183 --> 01:31:12,942
Colonel Rhodes. Glad to see you could make it, son.

918
01:31:13,344 --> 01:31:14,424
I feel safer already

919
01:31:20,023 --> 01:31:23,503
We gotta make a decision. We can either save
the President or Pepper. We can't do both.

920
01:31:23,823 --> 01:31:25,503
Sir, I have an update from Malibu.

921
01:31:25,503 --> 01:31:29,503
The cranes have finally arrived and the
cellar doors are being cleared as we speak.

922
01:31:30,063 --> 01:31:34,183
And what about the suit I'm wearing?
- The armor is now at 92 %.

923
01:31:34,542 --> 01:31:35,862
That's gonna have to do.

924
01:31:45,223 --> 01:31:47,383
Oh, here he comes, here he comes, get a quick picture.
- Sure.

925
01:32:05,303 --> 01:32:07,224
Is everything all right, Colonel?

926
01:32:38,022 --> 01:32:40,584
It is an honor, Mr. President

927
01:32:41,063 --> 01:32:44,703
If you're gonna do it, do it.

928
01:32:45,303 --> 01:32:47,823
That's not how the Mandarin works. - Sir.

929
01:32:48,263 --> 01:32:49,663
Air Force One's been compromised.

930
01:32:49,903 --> 01:32:52,783
Internal shots, temperature spikes. - Get me
eyes on it now. - Image coming through now, sir.

931
01:32:57,264 --> 01:32:59,503
Is that Rhodes?

932
01:33:28,503 --> 01:33:31,502
The President. Now.

933
01:33:31,783 --> 01:33:33,264
He's not here.

934
01:33:36,984 --> 01:33:41,943
Try the jet stream. Speaking of which, go fish!

935
01:34:03,783 --> 01:34:06,223
Walk away from that, you son of a bitch.

936
01:34:19,983 --> 01:34:22,024
How many in the air? - Thirteen, sir.

937
01:34:23,784 --> 01:34:25,583
How many can I carry? - Four, sir.

938
01:34:35,303 --> 01:34:39,264
Slow down, slow down.
Relax, what's your name? Heather..

939
01:34:46,863 --> 01:34:51,504
Listen, see that guy? I'm going to swing
by him and you're just going to grab him.

940
01:34:51,504 --> 01:34:53,823
You got it?

941
01:34:54,984 --> 01:35:03,543
I'll electrify your arm; you won't be able to
open your hand. You can do this, Heather.

942
01:35:10,183 --> 01:35:14,022
Easy, see? Eleven more to go.

943
01:35:15,782 --> 01:35:20,383
Remember that game called Barrel of Monkeys?
That's what we're going to do.

944
01:35:20,383 --> 01:35:23,023
18,000 feet - Come on, everybody, grab your monkey!

945
01:35:27,102 --> 01:35:30,383
Nice! - 10,000 feet.

946
01:35:33,623 --> 01:35:35,583
6,000 feet - Come on, people.

947
01:35:37,223 --> 01:35:38,863
Come on, come on, come on

948
01:35:41,904 --> 01:35:45,264
Yeah! - 1000 feet.

949
01:35:46,783 --> 01:35:50,903
800 feet. 200 feet, sir.
- It's a tricky monkey, let's get him.

950
01:35:51,743 --> 01:35:55,103
Hello.

951
01:36:15,983 --> 01:36:20,103
Nice work guys. Excellent.
Good team effort all around. Go us.

952
01:36:20,743 --> 01:36:23,263
Alright, Jarvis, but it's only half done,
we still gotta get Pepp-

953
01:36:31,263 --> 01:36:33,784
That came out of nowhere.

954
01:36:34,623 --> 01:36:36,744
Gimme some good news man.
- I think they all made it. - Thank God.

955
01:36:37,263 --> 01:36:39,102
Yeah, but I missed the President.

956
01:36:39,503 --> 01:36:42,343
You couldn't save the President with the suit,
how are you gonna save Pepper without it?

957
01:36:43,183 --> 01:36:47,223
Uh, say Jarvis, is it that time?
- The "house party" protocol, sir?

958
01:36:47,223 --> 01:36:49,223
Correct.

959
01:37:19,824 --> 01:37:21,703
Hi.

960
01:37:27,404 --> 01:37:32,904
You think he's gonna help you... he won't.

961
01:37:36,744 --> 01:37:42,624
Having you here is not just to motivate Tony Stark;
it's actually more embarrassing than that.

962
01:37:43,623 --> 01:37:50,623
You're here as my, um - Trophy.

963
01:38:00,983 --> 01:38:03,102
Good evening, sir.

964
01:38:06,504 --> 01:38:08,423
Welcome aboard, Mr. President.

965
01:38:18,343 --> 01:38:25,543
You ever heard of an elephant graveyard? Well, two
years ago, the elephant in the room was this ship.

966
01:38:26,543 --> 01:38:27,703
This is the Roxxon Norco.

967
01:38:27,703 --> 01:38:31,704
Of course you remember when she spilled
100 million gallons of crude off Pensacola.

968
01:38:32,263 --> 01:38:34,823
Thanks to you, not one fat cat saw a day in court.

969
01:38:35,103 --> 01:38:36,423
What do you want from me?

970
01:38:38,223 --> 01:38:39,264
Uh, nothing, sir.

971
01:38:39,903 --> 01:38:42,624
I just needed a reason to kill
you that would play well on TV.

972
01:38:43,223 --> 01:38:47,183
You see, I've moved on.
I've found myself a new political patron, and

973
01:38:48,303 --> 01:38:50,783
At this time tomorrow, he'll have your job.

974
01:38:50,783 --> 01:38:52,783
String him up.

975
01:39:12,143 --> 01:39:14,703
Come on.

976
01:39:17,863 --> 01:39:21,583
You're not gonna freak out on me, right? 
- I hope not.

977
01:39:46,263 --> 01:39:47,903
Oh my god.

978
01:39:49,584 --> 01:39:53,103
He's strung up over the oil tank;
they're gonna light him up, man. - Viking funeral.

979
01:39:53,463 --> 01:39:56,423
Public execution. 
- Yeah, death by oil.

980
01:40:02,543 --> 01:40:05,623
Broadcast will commence shortly. Take final positions.

981
01:40:06,863 --> 01:40:10,543
Okay, that's great. Now give me cameras
A through E and do a full tech rehearsal.

982
01:40:12,726 --> 01:40:13,811
Is your gun up?

983
01:40:14,236 --> 01:40:18,430
Yup, what do I do? - Stay on my six, cover high,
and don't shoot me in the back. - Six, high, back. Alright.

984
01:40:29,983 --> 01:40:32,784
You see that? Nailed it.
- Yeah, you really killed the glass.

985
01:40:32,784 --> 01:40:35,663
I was aiming for the bulb?
You can't hit a bulb from this distance.

986
01:40:40,263 --> 01:40:43,662
I'm out. Gimme, gimme, you got an extra magazine?
- They're not universal, Tony.

987
01:40:43,983 --> 01:40:45,783
I know what I'm doing, I make this stuff. Gimme
another one. - I don't have one that fits that gun.

988
01:40:46,263 --> 01:40:50,543
You've got like five of them. Alright, here's
what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna spot. Ready?

989
01:40:50,543 --> 01:40:54,303
What'd you see? - Too fast, nothing. Here we go.

990
01:41:00,143 --> 01:41:02,103
Three guys, one girl, all armed.

991
01:41:12,183 --> 01:41:15,783
God, I'd kill for some armor right now.
- You're right, we need backup. - Yeah, much.

992
01:41:17,184 --> 01:41:19,782
You know what?

993
01:41:22,543 --> 01:41:24,103
Is that? 
- Yep.

994
01:41:25,584 --> 01:41:26,703
Are those? 
- Yeah.

995
01:41:44,023 --> 01:41:45,463
Merry Christmas, buddy.

996
01:41:50,623 --> 01:41:54,863
Jarvis, target Extremis heat signatures.
Disable with extreme prejudice. - Yes, sir.

997
01:42:00,823 --> 01:42:03,903
What are you waiting for? It's Christmas.

998
01:42:05,463 --> 01:42:06,264
Take 'em to church.

999
01:42:27,864 --> 01:42:30,183
Jarvis, get Igor to steady this thing.

1000
01:42:42,143 --> 01:42:45,343
This is how you've been managing your downtime, huh?
- Everybody needs a hobby.

1001
01:42:51,703 --> 01:42:53,743
Heartbreaker? Help Red Snapper out, will ya?

1002
01:43:21,984 --> 01:43:24,743
Nice timing.
- Oh yeah, that's awesome. Give me a suit, okay?

1003
01:43:26,904 --> 01:43:28,703
Oh, I'm sorry. They're only coded to me.

1004
01:43:29,103 --> 01:43:30,863
What's that mean? 
- I got you covered.

1005
01:43:34,583 --> 01:43:37,783
Good evening, Colonel. Can I give you a lift?
- Very funny.

1006
01:43:55,584 --> 01:43:57,864
Sir, I've located Miss Potts. 
- About time.

1007
01:44:10,663 --> 01:44:13,584
Stop, put it down, put it down, put it down.

1008
01:44:16,223 --> 01:44:18,023
See what happens when you
hang out with my ex-girlfriends?

1009
01:44:21,103 --> 01:44:23,583
You're such a jerk. 
- Yup, we'll talk about it at dinner.

1010
01:44:25,422 --> 01:44:28,143
Come on, a little more, baby.

1011
01:44:43,983 --> 01:44:45,424
Is this guy bothering you?

1012
01:44:46,983 --> 01:44:49,704
Don't get up!

1013
01:44:52,703 --> 01:44:55,063
Is it hot there?

1014
01:44:56,023 --> 01:44:57,702
Stuck? Feel a little stuck?

1015
01:44:58,703 --> 01:45:01,983
Like a little turtle, cooking in his little turtle suit?

1016
01:45:02,583 --> 01:45:04,183
Tony

1017
01:45:04,183 --> 01:45:05,824
She's watching.

1018
01:45:07,024 --> 01:45:08,544
I think you should close your eyes.

1019
01:45:08,544 --> 01:45:09,543
Close your eyes.

1020
01:45:09,543 --> 01:45:12,703
Close your eyes; you don't want to see this.

1021
01:45:20,544 --> 01:45:22,063
Yeah, you take a minute.

1022
01:45:55,103 --> 01:45:56,784
Jarvis, give me a suit right now!

1023
01:46:07,743 --> 01:46:09,343
Aw, come on!

1024
01:46:10,743 --> 01:46:13,703
Mr. President! Just hold on, alright? I'm coming.

1025
01:46:14,983 --> 01:46:17,223
Just hold on. Hold on.

1026
01:46:39,023 --> 01:46:41,982
Buh-bye.

1027
01:46:52,183 --> 01:46:53,943
Brace yourself!

1028
01:47:03,423 --> 01:47:07,903
You look damn good, Mr.
President, but I'm gonna need that suit back.

1029
01:47:21,184 --> 01:47:22,863
The President is secure, Tony. 
I'm clearing the area.

1030
01:47:23,263 --> 01:47:26,622
Nice work. - Ready sir? 
- What do you mean "ready"?

1031
01:47:35,584 --> 01:47:39,822
Pep, I got you. Relax, I got you. Just look at me.

1032
01:47:41,703 --> 01:47:45,423
Honey, I can't reach any further,
and you can't stay there, alright? You gotta let go.

1033
01:47:45,822 --> 01:47:49,224
You gotta let go. I'll catch you, I promise.

1034
01:48:18,703 --> 01:48:23,584
What a shame; I would have caught her.

1035
01:49:39,624 --> 01:49:42,063
Well here we are, on the roof

1036
01:49:52,423 --> 01:49:54,223
Mark 42 inbound. - Well I'll be damned.

1037
01:49:55,023 --> 01:49:56,583
The prodigal son returns.

1038
01:50:12,743 --> 01:50:13,903
Whatever.

1039
01:50:14,903 --> 01:50:16,782
You really didn't deserve her, Tony.

1040
01:50:18,024 --> 01:50:21,783
It's a pity. 
I was so close to having her... perfect.

1041
01:50:23,743 --> 01:50:27,903
Okay, okay, wait, wait, slow down, slow down.
Okay, you're right. I don't deserve her.

1042
01:50:30,383 --> 01:50:31,903
But here's where you're wrong:

1043
01:50:32,623 --> 01:50:34,983
She was already perfect.

1044
01:50:41,543 --> 01:50:47,862
Jarvis, do me a favor and blow Mark 42.

1045
01:50:46,085 --> 01:50:49,997
NOOOO!

1046
01:52:01,383 --> 01:52:03,342
No more false faces.

1047
01:52:04,223 --> 01:52:09,223
You said you wanted the Mandarin.
You're looking right at him.

1048
01:52:10,024 --> 01:52:15,303
It was always me, Tony,
right from the start. I am the Mandarin!

1049
01:52:26,663 --> 01:52:28,383
I got nothing.

1050
01:52:34,223 --> 01:52:37,383
Jarvis, subject at my 12 o'clock
is not a target, disengage!

1051
01:52:45,943 --> 01:52:47,983
What? Oh, what, are you mad at me?

1052
01:53:12,743 --> 01:53:15,703
Honey.

1053
01:53:19,263 --> 01:53:21,423
Oh, my god.

1054
01:53:21,423 --> 01:53:24,703
I was really violent.

1055
01:53:25,663 --> 01:53:30,503
You just scared the devil out of me. I thought you were
- I was dead. Why? Because I fell two hundred feet?

1056
01:53:32,863 --> 01:53:37,104
Who's the hot mess now? 
- Still debatable.

1057
01:53:37,863 --> 01:53:40,143
Probably tipping your way a little bit.
Why don't you dress like this at home?

1058
01:53:40,704 --> 01:53:42,703
Hmm? Sports bra, the whole deal.

1059
01:53:43,543 --> 01:53:45,943
You know I think I understand why
you don't want to give up the suits.

1060
01:53:46,824 --> 01:53:48,783
What I am gonna complain about now?

1061
01:53:50,142 --> 01:53:53,622
Well, it's me. I'll think of something.

1062
01:53:55,223 --> 01:53:58,263
Don't touch me. No, I'm gonna burn you! - No, no

1063
01:53:59,404 --> 01:54:00,703
You're not hot.

1064
01:54:02,022 --> 01:54:03,703
Am I gonna be okay?

1065
01:54:03,703 --> 01:54:06,864
No, you're in a relationship with me,
everything will never be okay.

1066
01:54:07,783 --> 01:54:09,703
But I think I can figure this out, yeah.

1067
01:54:09,703 --> 01:54:14,184
I almost had this 20 years ago when I was drunk.
I think I can get you better.

1068
01:54:15,342 --> 01:54:16,943
That's what I do. I fix things.

1069
01:54:18,183 --> 01:54:20,383
And all your distractions?

1070
01:54:20,783 --> 01:54:23,023
Uh, I'm gonna shave them down a little bit.

1071
01:54:23,023 --> 01:54:29,023
Jarvis, hey.
- All wrapped up here, sir. Will there be anything else?

1072
01:54:29,023 --> 01:54:30,023
You know what to do.

1073
01:54:30,023 --> 01:54:33,203
The "clean slate" protocol, sir?

1074
01:54:33,203 --> 01:54:36,503
Screw it, it's Christmas. Yes, yes.

1075
01:55:13,423 --> 01:55:15,623
Okay so far? You like it?

1076
01:55:15,623 --> 01:55:17,703
It'll do.

1077
01:55:27,063 --> 01:55:31,983
And so, as Christmas morning began,
my journey had reached its end.

1078
01:55:36,383 --> 01:55:40,663
You start with something pure, something exciting

1079
01:55:41,343 --> 01:55:44,103
Then come the mistakes

1080
01:55:44,863 --> 01:55:46,783
The compromises

1081
01:55:53,063 --> 01:55:55,423
We create our own demons.

1082
01:56:00,984 --> 01:56:03,183
It's great to see you.

1083
01:56:03,183 --> 01:56:06,323
As promised, I got Pepper sorted out;
it took some tinkering.

1084
01:56:07,003 --> 01:56:08,523
But then I thought to myself,

1085
01:56:08,962 --> 01:56:10,523
"Why stop there?"

1086
01:56:14,803 --> 01:56:17,404
Of course,
there are people who say progress is dangerous.

1087
01:56:18,003 --> 01:56:21,403
But I'll bet none of those idiots ever
had to live with a chest full of shrapnel.

1088
01:56:21,964 --> 01:56:24,364
And now... neither will I.

1089
01:56:25,882 --> 01:56:29,242
Let me tell you: that was the best sleep I'd had in years.

1090
01:56:52,483 --> 01:56:56,243
It's okay, it's okay. - No!

1091
01:58:12,484 --> 01:58:15,404
So if I were to wrap this up
tight with a bow or whatever,

1092
01:58:16,162 --> 01:58:21,283
I guess I'd say my armor was
never a distraction or a hobby.

1093
01:58:22,604 --> 01:58:24,523
It was a cocoon.

1094
01:58:26,043 --> 01:58:30,442
And now, I'm a changed man.

1095
01:58:40,084 --> 01:58:41,563
You can take away my house,

1096
01:58:41,963 --> 01:58:43,402
All my tricks and toys

1097
01:58:44,683 --> 01:58:46,084
One thing you can't take away...

1098
01:58:50,043 --> 01:58:51,844
I am Iron Man.
