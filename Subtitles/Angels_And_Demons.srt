1
00:02:06,872 --> 00:02:08,472
The Ring of the Fisherman

2
00:02:09,073 --> 00:02:10,873
which bears the official Papal Sigil.

3
00:02:12,052 --> 00:02:14,574
Must be destroyed immediately following the Pope’s death.

4
00:02:16,714 --> 00:02:20,151
The Papal parchment is then sealed for 9 days of mourning.

5
00:02:20,552 --> 00:02:25,785
A period known as "Sede Vacante"... the time of the Empty Throne.

6
00:02:28,312 --> 00:02:32,919
Over the last several days the Catholic leaders from every corner of the world

7
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,333
have flocked to Rome.

8
00:02:34,388 --> 00:02:38,412
Shocked by the sudden death of this progressive and beloved Pope.

9
00:02:45,793 --> 00:02:48,190
Today in St. Peter's Square

10
00:02:48,294 --> 00:02:51,794
the faithful pray that there is among them another leader who can

11
00:02:52,033 --> 00:02:53,158
reunite their Church

12
00:02:53,245 --> 00:02:56,945
which has been raven by change and dissent in recent years.

13
00:03:01,063 --> 00:03:03,397
As the body of Pontif passes by...

14
00:03:03,862 --> 00:03:06,862
We see prayers being offered by the Preferiti...

15
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:12,898
favorites among those who are considered to succeed him as the Vicar of Christ.

16
00:03:20,808 --> 00:03:24,108
At the end of the mourning period the Colleague of Cardinals will lock itself

17
00:03:24,357 --> 00:03:27,657
behind the doors of the Sistine Chapel for Conclave.

18
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:30,742
A process by which they will choose a new leader...

19
00:03:31,189 --> 00:03:33,089
for the world's one billion Catholics

20
00:03:34,165 --> 00:03:36,365
who now find their Church at crossroads...

21
00:03:37,073 --> 00:03:39,673
it's ancient traditions threatened by modern world.

22
00:03:49,227 --> 00:03:53,398
Attention Control booth. Going online on LHC beam event.

23
00:03:54,412 --> 00:03:56,412
We are powering up.

24
00:04:00,112 --> 00:04:02,338
Attention Category 1 personnel.

25
00:04:02,484 --> 00:04:05,862
Interlock areas is now restricted.

26
00:04:05,864 --> 00:04:08,558
You have blocked our access, Philippe.

27
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:14,215
You are terrified because you gave it your all. The accelerator should never create antimatter.

28
00:04:14,294 --> 00:04:17,294
It's only three cylinders under high security. I only ask you to wait.

29
00:04:19,104 --> 00:04:20,104
Don’t worry.

30
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:24,329
But listen, even with proper calibration, we might not be prepared.

31
00:04:26,983 --> 00:04:28,983
Are you going to call the director or should I?

32
00:04:34,366 --> 00:04:35,666
Vittoria, Vittoria,

33
00:04:37,466 --> 00:04:40,917
this will not blast us to the other side. So, please.

34
00:04:41,765 --> 00:04:43,365
Powering on RTC magnets.

35
00:04:45,498 --> 00:04:48,298
Ion source age in 4-3-2.

36
00:04:50,813 --> 00:04:52,679
Start the collision sequence.

37
00:04:52,902 --> 00:04:55,502
Vittoria, what did Philippe say?

38
00:04:55,585 --> 00:04:58,885
He did not change his mind.

39
00:04:59,187 --> 00:05:00,387
What do you think?

40
00:05:00,626 --> 00:05:03,826
God help us, if there is a God.

41
00:05:05,342 --> 00:05:07,642
Beam on. Beam stability is good. Take your places people.

42
00:05:09,923 --> 00:05:12,923
Trigger calibrated. Collision is imminent.

43
00:05:14,385 --> 00:05:16,585
Injecting 13 protons per bunch.

44
00:05:18,052 --> 00:05:19,952
Let’s hope the heavy ion guys didn't mess up.

45
00:05:25,049 --> 00:05:26,549
Luminosity monitors operational.

46
00:05:27,397 --> 00:05:29,435
Beam line has no restrictions.

47
00:05:29,821 --> 00:05:31,021
Enable beam captor.

48
00:05:31,986 --> 00:05:33,486
Accelerating the beam.

49
00:05:33,963 --> 00:05:35,163
Stage 1.

50
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,050
Magnets is full field.

51
00:05:39,369 --> 00:05:40,669
Last piece still too high.

52
00:05:41,157 --> 00:05:43,457
Yeah, we got lumonasanity 10 out of 34.

53
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:46,179
Injecting particle beams.

54
00:05:47,937 --> 00:05:50,647
Turning the LHC.

55
00:05:51,452 --> 00:05:53,852
Capture quickly approaches!

56
00:05:54,309 --> 00:05:56,609
Awaiting completion of resonance.

57
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,670
Particles in transition.

58
00:06:01,574 --> 00:06:04,774
Collision is fixed and running.

59
00:06:05,483 --> 00:06:08,483
LHC injecting protons beam 1.

60
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:14,952
- Lock the feedback systems.
- Particles at 99% of the speed of light.

61
00:06:16,655 --> 00:06:18,600
Colliding stable beams.

62
00:06:19,152 --> 00:06:20,552
Activating injection kicker.

63
00:06:23,834 --> 00:06:26,005
We have signal on luminosity monitors.

64
00:06:26,631 --> 00:06:28,790
We have events.

65
00:06:34,092 --> 00:06:36,328
Photons are moving.

66
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,752
We have created antimatter.

67
00:07:01,261 --> 00:07:03,827
It seems that we have achieved.

68
00:07:11,771 --> 00:07:13,218
Silvano, we have created it.

69
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:22,590
We are now in God's hands, Vittoria!

70
00:07:24,323 --> 00:07:25,423
I'm on my way.

71
00:08:24,098 --> 00:08:25,306
Silvano!

72
00:08:25,945 --> 00:08:27,010
Silvano!

73
00:08:49,743 --> 00:08:51,045
Why?

74
00:08:52,739 --> 00:08:54,585
Help!

75
00:08:54,782 --> 00:08:56,220
Help!

76
00:09:51,861 --> 00:09:53,161
This swim might...

77
00:09:53,162 --> 00:09:54,462
help your jet lag.

78
00:09:54,881 --> 00:09:56,481
I beg your pardon?

79
00:09:56,659 --> 00:09:59,255
Them bags under your eyes...
Besides it's 5 in the morning

80
00:09:59,669 --> 00:10:00,969
and you are from Vatican.

81
00:10:02,077 --> 00:10:04,016
The crossed keys under Triregnum.

82
00:10:05,024 --> 00:10:06,775
It is the Papal symbol.

83
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:13,903
Claudio Vicenza, Corpodella Gendarmerie Vaticano.

84
00:10:14,288 --> 00:10:15,893
Vatican police?

85
00:10:17,219 --> 00:10:19,136
I was expecting another letter

86
00:10:21,264 --> 00:10:24,189
to my request to access your archives.

87
00:10:24,637 --> 00:10:27,951
Shouldn't you be in Rome? Kind of busy time for you guys.

88
00:10:28,744 --> 00:10:30,606
In fact, I was in New York...

89
00:10:30,728 --> 00:10:33,992
detailed to the UN.
I received a phone call middle of the night.

90
00:10:34,209 --> 00:10:36,602
"Find Professor Robert Langdon,"

91
00:10:36,926 --> 00:10:39,141
"A matter of great urgency."

92
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,683
They told me to show you this.

93
00:10:52,802 --> 00:10:55,375
The Illuminati? They disappeared hundreds of years ago.

94
00:10:55,736 --> 00:10:57,595
- Did they?
- Look at that again.

95
00:10:57,628 --> 00:11:00,533
It is an ambigram. It is the same image forwards and backwards.

96
00:11:00,964 --> 00:11:03,168
Now that’s common for a symbol like Yin and Yang

97
00:11:04,203 --> 00:11:05,258
or a swastika but...that's a word.

98
00:11:05,411 --> 00:11:10,064
That Illuminati ambigramatic symbol has been considered a myth for 400 years.

99
00:11:10,141 --> 00:11:15,728
Possibly in 16th century some artist created it as a tribute to Galileo’s love of symmetry.

100
00:11:15,737 --> 00:11:19,194
It was only gonna be revealed when the Illuminati had amassed enough power...
101
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:21,988
to resurface and carry out their final goal.

102
00:11:22,028 --> 00:11:23,228
I wrote a book about it.

103
00:11:23,915 --> 00:11:25,357
Which is why you are here.

104
00:11:25,448 --> 00:11:27,752
The Art of the Illuminati -- By Robert Langdon.

105
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:28,845
Part 1.

106
00:11:29,903 --> 00:11:33,842
Haven’t been able to finish Part 2 because I’m not allowed access to your archives.

107
00:11:38,915 --> 00:11:41,132
It's remarkable... similar.

108
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:45,864
Someone is trying to make you believe the llluminatis themselves have returned to Rome.

109
00:11:45,897 --> 00:11:47,971
Right after the death of the Pope...

110
00:11:51,788 --> 00:11:55,213
4 Cardinals were kidnapped from their quarters inside Vatican sometime between

111
00:11:55,636 --> 00:11:56,936
3 and 5 AM this morning.

112
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,505
Shortly afterwards...

113
00:11:59,633 --> 00:12:02,695
that document was sent to the office of the Swiss Guard...

114
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:04,015
along with the threat...

115
00:12:04,104 --> 00:12:08,104
the Cardinals would be publicly executed 1 per hour beginning at 8 PM tonight

116
00:12:08,172 --> 00:12:09,979
in Rome.

117
00:12:19,783 --> 00:12:21,164
Conclave?

118
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:25,545
Was to begin today. We postponed the start for a few hours as story of illness.

119
00:12:25,558 --> 00:12:27,438
There are no suspicions... yet.

120
00:12:28,853 --> 00:12:30,398
What do you want from me?

121
00:12:31,076 --> 00:12:34,305
These criminals who sent this ambigram

122
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:35,854
meant it as a taunt.

123
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,140
A provocation.

124
00:12:37,219 --> 00:12:40,776
But Capitan Olivetti thinks if you can use it to learn their identity

125
00:12:41,147 --> 00:12:44,235
perhaps, we can stop this abomination.

126
00:12:48,272 --> 00:12:49,570
Why me?

127
00:12:50,051 --> 00:12:53,120
Your expertise, your erudition.

128
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:59,618
Your reciting involvement with certain Church, shall we say... mysteries?

129
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:04,220
I wasn't under the impression that episode had endeared me to the Vatican.

130
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:05,954
Oh, it didn’t.

131
00:13:05,992 --> 00:13:10,929
But, it did make you... what’s that word...forma...formi...

132
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,270
Formidable?

133
00:13:14,156 --> 00:13:16,409
A Vatican jet is standing by 20 minutes from here...

134
00:13:16,804 --> 00:13:17,904
Will you come with me?

135
00:13:25,968 --> 00:13:27,414
Professor Langdon

136
00:13:27,546 --> 00:13:31,213
you spent your life searching for symbols like the one you now hold in your hand.

137
00:13:31,564 --> 00:13:35,373
How much longer are we going to pretend you’re not already decided to come?

138
00:13:42,801 --> 00:13:45,508
If Illuminati have returned and are in Rome

139
00:13:45,949 --> 00:13:47,949
we will hunt them down and kill them.

140
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:53,164
The Illuminati did not become violent until the 17th century.

141
00:13:53,409 --> 00:13:55,400
Their name means "The Enlightened Ones"...

142
00:13:55,477 --> 00:13:57,903
They were physicists, mathematicians, astronomers.

143
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,448
They were concerned...

144
00:13:59,573 --> 00:14:02,873
with a Church and an inaccurate teaching and they were dedicated to scientific truth.

145
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:05,343
But the Vatican did not like that. So the Church begun to...

146
00:14:05,475 --> 00:14:06,575
How do you say it...?

147
00:14:06,623 --> 00:14:08,657
Oh, hunt them down and killed them.

148
00:14:09,893 --> 00:14:11,093
Drove them down underground

149
00:14:12,563 --> 00:14:15,371
into a secret society.

150
00:15:03,065 --> 00:15:04,565
- Professor Langdon.
- Yes.

151
00:15:04,934 --> 00:15:06,219
Welcome to the Vatican City.

152
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:10,346
Ernesto Olivetti, Inspector General of Vatican police force.

153
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:11,878
My pleasure.

154
00:15:11,906 --> 00:15:12,827
This way please.

155
00:15:13,197 --> 00:15:15,428
We'll meet in the headquarters of the Swiss Guard.

156
00:15:15,898 --> 00:15:19,750
- I thought you were Swiss Guard.
- No, uh, the Gendarmaria.

157
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,500
We are responsible for everything inside the Vatican walls.

158
00:15:23,254 --> 00:15:27,071
With the exception of the Security of a... His Holiness

159
00:15:27,262 --> 00:15:29,286
and the Apostolic Palace... That is Swiss Guard.

160
00:15:30,239 --> 00:15:31,938
The Ramon carbieri are here as well

161
00:15:32,487 --> 00:15:33,687
in an advisory capacity.

162
00:15:34,043 --> 00:15:35,540
So jurisdictionally this is.

163
00:15:35,661 --> 00:15:37,334
A god-dammed nightmare.

164
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,672
Oh, yes. Pope Pius the 9th. The Great Castration.

165
00:15:46,772 --> 00:15:47,824
I beg your pardon?

166
00:15:47,951 --> 00:15:52,924
1857, Pope Pius the 9th felt
the male form would inspire lust...

167
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:55,195
So he took hammer and chisel and...

168
00:15:55,665 --> 00:15:57,971
unmanned hundreds of these statues.

169
00:15:58,536 --> 00:16:01,020
The plaster fig leaves were added later.

170
00:16:03,351 --> 00:16:06,574
Are you anti-catholic Professor Langdon?

171
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,058
No.

172
00:16:08,762 --> 00:16:10,562
I'm anti-vandalism.

173
00:16:14,126 --> 00:16:16,402
I urge you to guard your tone here.

174
00:16:16,961 --> 00:16:18,161
The Swiss Guard is a calling.

175
00:16:19,184 --> 00:16:20,584
Not a profession.

176
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:27,273
Commander Richter the head of the Guard.

177
00:16:27,364 --> 00:16:29,414
He is a deeply spiritual man.

178
00:16:29,563 --> 00:16:31,463
He was very close to the late Pope. Understood.

179
00:16:31,596 --> 00:16:34,990
Look, I don’t study the symbols because I consider them

180
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,118
unimportant ceremonial traditions that mark our lives.

181
00:16:37,305 --> 00:16:38,943
I just hope I can help.

182
00:16:38,976 --> 00:16:40,503
So do I.

183
00:16:40,925 --> 00:16:42,388
You were my idea.

184
00:16:53,729 --> 00:16:56,475
Wait here. Please.

185
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:01,616
Commander...Commander Richter.

186
00:17:09,174 --> 00:17:10,750
Dr. Vetra.

187
00:17:12,267 --> 00:17:14,764
I’m Commander Richter. Commentate Principale of the Swiss Guard.

188
00:17:14,881 --> 00:17:16,020
Thank you for coming.

189
00:17:16,413 --> 00:17:17,184
Hello.

190
00:17:17,986 --> 00:17:19,686
Oh, Professor Langdon.

191
00:17:20,938 --> 00:17:23,009
What a relief... The symbolist is here.

192
00:17:23,101 --> 00:17:24,961
This way please, Miss Vetra.

193
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:28,237
The situation has changed.

194
00:17:28,675 --> 00:17:30,782
We received another threat from the kidnapper.

195
00:17:31,644 --> 00:17:34,462
The canister was stolen from our lab around noon yesterday.

196
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:37,653
The intruder killed my research partner Silvano Bentivoglio

197
00:17:38,288 --> 00:17:40,488
and mutilated him in order to bypass security.

198
00:17:41,511 --> 00:17:43,311
We use retinal scanners...

199
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:46,213
They cut out his eye.

200
00:17:47,157 --> 00:17:49,244
Is that your stolen canister Ms. Vetra?

201
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,311
Where is that camera number 86?

202
00:17:52,437 --> 00:17:55,824
It's wireless. It too was stolen, lt could be anywhere inside Vatican walls.

203
00:17:55,843 --> 00:17:58,931
That canister contains extremely combustible substance called antimatter.

204
00:17:58,983 --> 00:18:01,936
We need to relocate it immediately, or evacuate Vatican City.

205
00:18:02,377 --> 00:18:04,618
I am quite familiar with the substances Miss Vetra

206
00:18:04,704 --> 00:18:06,774
I never heard antimatter is used as such.

207
00:18:06,817 --> 00:18:09,965
Well it was never generated in significant quantities before.

208
00:18:10,093 --> 00:18:12,848
It is a way of studying the origins of the universe.

209
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:15,671
Try to isolate what some people called God 'Particle'.

210
00:18:15,792 --> 00:18:17,680
But there are implications for energy research.

211
00:18:17,757 --> 00:18:19,424
God 'Particle'?

212
00:18:20,464 --> 00:18:24,012
Ah, what we call it isn’t important. lt’s what gives all matter mass.

213
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,198
The thing without which it could not exist.

214
00:18:26,287 --> 00:18:28,842
You are talking about "The Moment of Creation."

215
00:18:29,459 --> 00:18:30,829
Yes, in a way I am.

216
00:18:31,942 --> 00:18:33,755
The antimatter is suspended there,

217
00:18:33,972 --> 00:18:37,172
in an air-tight nanocapacity shell with electromagnets in its head.

218
00:18:37,639 --> 00:18:40,413
But if it were to fall out of suspension and come in contact with the matter,

219
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:41,530
say bottom of canister...

220
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:45,230
the 2 opposing forces would annihilate one other violently.

221
00:18:45,613 --> 00:18:47,646
And what might cause it to fall out of suspension?

222
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:51,382
The battery going dead... Which it will. Just before midnight.

223
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:54,156
What kind of annihilation, how violent?

224
00:18:54,251 --> 00:18:56,097
A cataclysmic event.

225
00:18:56,143 --> 00:18:59,971
A blinding explosion equivalent to about 5 kilotons.

226
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:04,260
Vatican City would be consumed by light.

227
00:19:05,962 --> 00:19:07,950
Those are the exact words the kidnappers used.

228
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:11,598
"We will destroy your 4 pillars."

229
00:19:12,637 --> 00:19:14,535
"We will brand your Preferiti,"

230
00:19:14,766 --> 00:19:16,766
"and sacrifice them on the altars of science."

231
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:20,907
"Then bring your Church down upon you."

232
00:19:21,297 --> 00:19:24,436
"Vatican will see they will be consumed by light."

233
00:19:24,952 --> 00:19:28,366
"A shining star at the end of the path... of illumination."

234
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,499
It’s the ancient and only one threat.

235
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:38,861
Destruction of Vatican City through the Light.

236
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:42,315
The 4 pillars. These are the kidnapped Cardinals.

237
00:19:43,017 --> 00:19:47,387
You didn’t tell me they were Preferiti. The favorites to be named the next Pope.

238
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,988
Play it again.

239
00:19:57,653 --> 00:20:00,716
We will destroy your 4 pillars.

240
00:20:02,745 --> 00:20:04,928
- We will brand your Preferiti...
- Wait. Stop.

241
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,229
Brand them?

242
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,161
That’s another...

243
00:20:12,652 --> 00:20:15,052
Illuminati legend. This one says there's a...

244
00:20:15,928 --> 00:20:17,628
set of 5 brands...

245
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:22,788
Each one an ambigram. The 1st 4 are the fundamentals of science.

246
00:20:22,852 --> 00:20:24,973
Earth, Air, Fire and Water.

247
00:20:25,063 --> 00:20:26,984
The 5th is a mystery.

248
00:20:29,572 --> 00:20:31,138
Maybe it is this.

249
00:20:31,584 --> 00:20:33,258
They say they will be killed publicly.

250
00:20:34,092 --> 00:20:35,223
Yes.

251
00:20:35,441 --> 00:20:36,502
Revenge.

252
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:38,296
For "La Purga".

253
00:20:38,382 --> 00:20:39,502
"La Purga"?

254
00:20:40,848 --> 00:20:43,359
Geez, you guys don’t even read your own history, do you?

255
00:20:44,726 --> 00:20:46,075
1668.

256
00:20:46,646 --> 00:20:51,646
The Church kidnapped 4 Illuminati scientists and branded each one of them on the chest...

257
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:53,057
with a symbol of the cross.

258
00:20:53,607 --> 00:20:56,363
To 'purge' them of their sins and they executed them.

259
00:20:56,712 --> 00:20:58,586
Threw their bodies out on the street...

260
00:20:58,671 --> 00:21:00,571
as warning to others to stop questioning...

261
00:21:00,608 --> 00:21:01,808
the Church ruling on scientific matters.

262
00:21:02,286 --> 00:21:03,265
They radicalized them.

263
00:21:03,444 --> 00:21:06,041
The Purge created a darker more violent Illuminati.

264
00:21:06,389 --> 00:21:08,789
Went bent on... on retribution.

265
00:21:09,845 --> 00:21:12,908
And look how they intend to finally get it... using antimatter.

266
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:17,058
Technology to destroy the Church. Science to obliterate Religion.

267
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:20,490
Is there any more?

268
00:21:22,023 --> 00:21:24,192
"... and sacrifice them on the altar of science."

269
00:21:24,627 --> 00:21:26,786
"Then bring your Church down upon you."

270
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:30,412
"Vatican will see they will be consumed by light."

271
00:21:31,201 --> 00:21:35,785
"A shining star at the end of the path... of Illumination."

272
00:21:41,006 --> 00:21:42,834
I need access to the Vatican archives.

273
00:21:44,964 --> 00:21:47,003
Professor I don’t think this is the appropriate moment.

274
00:21:47,091 --> 00:21:50,816
- Your petition has been denied 7 times.
- No. No. This has nothing to do with my work.

275
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,495
The path of the Illumination.

276
00:21:52,795 --> 00:21:55,790
It is a hidden trail through Rome itself. It leads to the Church of the Illumination.

277
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:58,557
A place where Illuminati would meet in secret.

278
00:21:58,898 --> 00:22:03,805
If I can find the seal, the sign that marks the beginning of that path,

279
00:22:04,446 --> 00:22:07,886
the 4 churches is maybe along where he intends to murder your Cardinals.

280
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:12,600
One every hour at 8, 9, 10 and 11. Then the device explodes...

281
00:22:13,274 --> 00:22:14,574
At midnight.

282
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,961
If we can figure out the first Church and get there before he does, maybe we can stop it.

283
00:22:19,057 --> 00:22:22,909
But I can’t find the start of the path till I get into the archives.

284
00:22:23,056 --> 00:22:25,056
Even if I wanted to help you...

285
00:22:25,443 --> 00:22:27,743
access to archives is only by written decree by

286
00:22:27,745 --> 00:22:30,083
the curator of the board of the Vatican Librarians.

287
00:22:31,012 --> 00:22:32,829
Or by Papal mandate.

288
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:36,284
Yes, as you no doubt you heard Holy Father is dead.

289
00:22:37,195 --> 00:22:38,478
What about il Camerlengo?

290
00:22:38,576 --> 00:22:40,176
The Camerlengo is just a priest here.

291
00:22:40,523 --> 00:22:41,805
The former Pope's Chamberlain.

292
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:45,841
Doesn't the power of the Holy See rest in him during "Tempo Sede Vacante"?

293
00:22:53,089 --> 00:22:55,426
Fellows... you called me.

294
00:22:58,076 --> 00:22:59,848
His Holiness once told me that the Pope is a man...

295
00:23:00,077 --> 00:23:02,363
torn between real world and the divine.

296
00:23:03,247 --> 00:23:05,809
It seems that the real world is upon us tonight.

297
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:10,608
I'm familiar with the Illuminati lore and the legend of the brandings.

298
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:13,810
The Purges are dark stains on this Church history.

299
00:23:14,277 --> 00:23:17,444
I'm not surprised that this ghost has returned to haunt us.

300
00:23:19,421 --> 00:23:20,555
Commandante.

301
00:23:20,646 --> 00:23:22,717
Have you begun a search for this explosive device?

302
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:24,421
Of course, but it could be anywhere.

303
00:23:24,595 --> 00:23:27,428
Our primary concern at the moment is to safety of the Cardinals.

304
00:23:27,485 --> 00:23:29,434
The Sistine Chapel is a fortress.

305
00:23:29,935 --> 00:23:33,449
As long the Cardinals are in the Conclave your security concerns are at minimum.

306
00:23:33,638 --> 00:23:35,138
- Devote as many.
- Signori...

307
00:23:35,226 --> 00:23:38,326
if you’re about to suggest naked eye search of the entire Vatican city.

308
00:23:38,546 --> 00:23:40,383
I will tell you we do not have the people.

309
00:23:40,421 --> 00:23:42,047
Though I am not His Holiness

310
00:23:42,693 --> 00:23:45,643
when you are addressing me you are addressing this office. Do you understand?

311
00:23:48,043 --> 00:23:49,205
Yes Father.

312
00:23:49,499 --> 00:23:50,614
Good.

313
00:23:51,744 --> 00:23:55,200
Now you said that the image on the screen was illuminated with artificial light.

314
00:23:56,545 --> 00:23:58,322
Might I suggest methodically cutting power to...

315
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,068
various sections of the city.

316
00:24:00,695 --> 00:24:03,110
When an image in screen goes dark you will have more specific idea

317
00:24:03,184 --> 00:24:04,711
of the camera's location.

318
00:24:08,753 --> 00:24:12,066
Dr. Vetra, besides yourself and your research partner

319
00:24:12,262 --> 00:24:14,692
who else knew of this antimatter project?

320
00:24:15,403 --> 00:24:17,810
No one but the research team.

321
00:24:17,899 --> 00:24:20,182
This project was strictly confidential.

322
00:24:20,257 --> 00:24:23,984
But Silvano kept detailed journals. If he told anyone else

323
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,415
about what we were doing he would have made note of it.

324
00:24:26,802 --> 00:24:28,079
Do you have these journals?

325
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:30,107
I can have them flown here from Geneve in an hour.

326
00:24:30,661 --> 00:24:31,747
Please.

327
00:24:33,363 --> 00:24:34,602
Professor Langdon.

328
00:24:45,698 --> 00:24:46,920
Mr. Langdon.

329
00:24:47,915 --> 00:24:51,502
You are correct that I may grant you access to the archives.

330
00:24:53,399 --> 00:24:54,724
Thank you padre.

331
00:24:54,791 --> 00:24:58,465
I said correct that I may. Not that I will.

332
00:25:00,302 --> 00:25:03,853
Christianity’s most secrets codices are in that archive...

333
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:07,212
Given your recent entanglement with the Church

334
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:11,330
there is a question I like to ask you first here in the office of His Holiness.

335
00:25:19,128 --> 00:25:20,853
Do you believe in God, sir?

336
00:25:24,626 --> 00:25:27,485
Father I simply believe that religion...

337
00:25:28,077 --> 00:25:30,967
I didn’t asked you to tell me what man says of God.

338
00:25:31,427 --> 00:25:33,750
I asked if you believe in God.

339
00:25:36,348 --> 00:25:38,453
I am an academic.

340
00:25:39,055 --> 00:25:42,149
My mind tells me that I will never...

341
00:25:42,155 --> 00:25:43,824
understand God.

342
00:25:44,144 --> 00:25:45,841
And your heart?

343
00:25:48,722 --> 00:25:51,077
Tells me I’m not meant to...

344
00:25:52,402 --> 00:25:55,960
Faith is a gift that I have yet to receive.

345
00:26:02,032 --> 00:26:04,263
Be delicate with our treasures.

346
00:26:11,198 --> 00:26:12,281
Archives is this way.

347
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:14,036
Professor Langdon.

348
00:26:15,479 --> 00:26:18,371
If this path really leads to the Church of the Illumination

349
00:26:18,466 --> 00:26:20,030
that may be where they have hidden the antimatter.

350
00:26:20,377 --> 00:26:22,266
Shining star at the end of the path I thought so too.

351
00:26:22,587 --> 00:26:23,387
Follow the path

352
00:26:23,433 --> 00:26:25,157
and we may find the canister at the end of it.

353
00:26:25,425 --> 00:26:26,792
Can you deactivate the device?

354
00:26:26,863 --> 00:26:30,154
I can change the canister's battery so long as we have more than 5 minutes supply,

355
00:26:30,387 --> 00:26:33,760
That would give us another 24 hours to get it safely back to CERN.

356
00:26:36,824 --> 00:26:37,877
Robert Langdon.

357
00:26:37,931 --> 00:26:39,301
Vittoria Vetra.

358
00:26:39,571 --> 00:26:42,627
Are you really symbolist or was he mocking you?

359
00:26:43,358 --> 00:26:44,527
Both.

360
00:26:44,601 --> 00:26:46,966
- you are physicist?
- bio-danglement physics.

361
00:26:47,224 --> 00:26:48,354
Interconnecting life systems.

362
00:26:48,431 --> 00:26:49,638
Okay.

363
00:26:50,153 --> 00:26:52,866
Your project, was it good to energy research?

364
00:26:53,006 --> 00:26:54,240
Eventually yes.

365
00:26:54,445 --> 00:26:57,585
One peg of antimatter could power the entire city for a month.

366
00:26:58,627 --> 00:27:00,823
Or tonight I guess destroy one.

367
00:27:01,991 --> 00:27:03,135
What are we looking for in archives?

368
00:27:03,171 --> 00:27:05,347
A banned volume by Galileo.

369
00:27:05,827 --> 00:27:06,919
Galileo was an Illuminati?

370
00:27:07,247 --> 00:27:09,179
Yes and Catholic

371
00:27:09,249 --> 00:27:12,121
who thinks Church and science were enemies...

372
00:27:12,153 --> 00:27:14,079
but just a difference in languish telling the same story...

373
00:27:14,139 --> 00:27:16,039
he would like minds to find the Church of the Illumination.

374
00:27:16,417 --> 00:27:18,017
But he could not actually advertise it's location...

375
00:27:18,443 --> 00:27:20,992
So he created a coded path.

376
00:27:22,927 --> 00:27:26,823
Richter has started to turn off power on various grids. It will be back in a minute.

377
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:31,708
Then some unknown Illuminati master sculpted 4 statues.

378
00:27:32,051 --> 00:27:34,751
Each one a tribute to one of the fundamental elements.

379
00:27:34,847 --> 00:27:39,845
Earth, air, water and fire, and placed the statues out in public, in churches throughout Rome.

380
00:27:40,221 --> 00:27:42,593
Each statue held clue pointing to the next.

381
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:45,204
At the end of the path was Church of the Illumination...

382
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:48,011
If you could find that then you could find them.

383
00:27:48,604 --> 00:27:51,274
What makes you think they're going to murder Cardinals in the churches?

384
00:27:51,357 --> 00:27:54,161
The Illuminatti called those 4 churches by the special name "L'altare de la Scienza"...

385
00:27:57,695 --> 00:28:00,072
"Sacrifice them on the altar of science", he said.

386
00:28:00,444 --> 00:28:01,848
Exactly.

387
00:28:05,223 --> 00:28:06,421
Wow...

388
00:28:06,557 --> 00:28:07,866
Look at this.

389
00:28:31,963 --> 00:28:33,584
Excuse me Signori.

390
00:28:35,646 --> 00:28:38,152
Cardinal Strauss have you been informed of the situation?

391
00:28:38,512 --> 00:28:39,648
Yeah.

392
00:28:40,531 --> 00:28:44,074
My belief is we should proceed with the sealing of Conclave.

393
00:28:44,114 --> 00:28:45,473
At this late hour?

394
00:28:46,005 --> 00:28:47,648
That would be highly unorthodox.

395
00:28:47,674 --> 00:28:50,798
And yet with such laws it’s my power. I'm the great elector.

396
00:28:51,127 --> 00:28:52,951
Cruelest honor and a crusader.

397
00:28:53,135 --> 00:28:56,114
I have no personal ambitions Patrick.

398
00:28:57,181 --> 00:28:59,112
Only those out for my Church.

399
00:28:59,188 --> 00:29:00,554
St. Peter's Church

400
00:29:01,026 --> 00:29:02,826
which is taken at it's most vulnerable moment.

401
00:29:03,984 --> 00:29:05,650
And this is not a coincidence.

402
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,007
The Church will not fall in a day.

403
00:29:07,051 --> 00:29:09,083
We must evacuate Vatican City.

404
00:29:09,442 --> 00:29:12,975
That is exactly what they want. Publicity and panic.

405
00:29:13,255 --> 00:29:15,897
No, you must not give them oxygen for the media fire.

406
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,378
But people in St. Peter's Square

407
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:22,082
care deeply about their Church

408
00:29:22,468 --> 00:29:23,695
as we do.

409
00:29:23,751 --> 00:29:24,851
Their faith will sustain them.

410
00:29:25,934 --> 00:29:28,957
Their Faith will not protect them from an explosion.

411
00:29:29,885 --> 00:29:33,316
We are all bound for heaven eventually are we not?

412
00:29:34,501 --> 00:29:37,482
Spoken like one who has enjoyed the blessings of a long full life.

413
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:39,153
Patrick.

414
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:42,890
Do not confuse the power of the office you temporary hold

415
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,404
with your true place!

416
00:29:44,477 --> 00:29:45,877
Intermediate!

417
00:29:47,502 --> 00:29:49,953
You were the favorite of His Holiness.

418
00:29:50,499 --> 00:29:52,386
But His Holiness...

419
00:29:52,639 --> 00:29:54,039
is with his Father now.

420
00:29:55,591 --> 00:29:56,815
I’m sorry. Mea culpa.

421
00:29:57,853 --> 00:29:59,409
Seal the doors.

422
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:17,138
It's time. Everyone outside.

423
00:31:07,152 --> 00:31:09,324
Fellows, this way please.

424
00:31:09,802 --> 00:31:11,422
Oh. Beautiful.

425
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:17,814
The chambers are hermetic boxes.

426
00:31:18,117 --> 00:31:19,806
Oxygen is kept to lowest possible levels.

427
00:31:19,966 --> 00:31:24,084
There is a partial vacuum inside, so extensive stays is not recommended.

428
00:31:24,959 --> 00:31:27,750
So don’t panic if you feel like lightheaded at first.

429
00:31:39,718 --> 00:31:42,544
I’ll be just outside the door watching you

430
00:31:42,976 --> 00:31:43,976
Mr. Langdon.

431
00:32:06,746 --> 00:32:08,598
The 2nd Payment Transfer
lsle of Man.

432
00:32:30,481 --> 00:32:33,086
The Conclave will go on without us.

433
00:32:33,447 --> 00:32:35,747
It must now of all times.

434
00:32:36,987 --> 00:32:39,416
May God forgive you for what you've done.

435
00:32:47,288 --> 00:32:49,781
Father, if God have issues...

436
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:51,910
they won’t be what I've done...

437
00:32:53,425 --> 00:32:56,041
They will be with what I’m about do.

438
00:33:17,676 --> 00:33:21,515
It was confiscated from The Nederlands by the Vatican just after Galileo died.

439
00:33:22,744 --> 00:33:24,896
I petitioned to see it about 10 years ago

440
00:33:25,098 --> 00:33:27,468
every since I realized what... what was in it?

441
00:33:27,478 --> 00:33:29,263
What makes you so sure this thing is there?

442
00:33:29,429 --> 00:33:30,726
The number 503.

443
00:33:31,093 --> 00:33:34,678
I kept seeing it over and over again in Illuminati letters,

444
00:33:35,627 --> 00:33:36,805
Scribbled in the margins...

445
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:39,266
Some times just signed 503. It is a numeric clue.

446
00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:41,124
But to what?

447
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,406
Well, that’s a meaningful number to the Illuminati.

448
00:33:43,504 --> 00:33:46,751
There's the pentagram. Pythagoras. Dozens of other examples in science.

449
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:47,900
But what about 3?

450
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:50,823
It didn’t makes sense, till I thought what if it was roman numerals?

451
00:33:50,922 --> 00:33:52,053
The I I I

452
00:33:52,101 --> 00:33:53,123
The 3.

453
00:33:53,222 --> 00:33:54,868
Galileo’s 3rd text.

454
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:56,306
Dialogo

455
00:33:56,364 --> 00:33:57,858
Discorso

456
00:33:57,951 --> 00:34:00,059
Diagramma.

457
00:34:11,044 --> 00:34:14,398
Just a few days of this and l could've actually finished my book.

458
00:34:14,423 --> 00:34:17,023
And sold dozen copies of it at the Harvard bookstore.

459
00:34:18,427 --> 00:34:20,104
Diagramma Veritatis.

460
00:34:20,722 --> 00:34:22,476
Diagram of Truth.

461
00:34:22,884 --> 00:34:24,579
I know about the book.

462
00:34:25,452 --> 00:34:28,518
Galileo laid out his theories about the earth revolving around the Sun.

463
00:34:28,607 --> 00:34:32,734
He said that the earth was not the center of some universe heaven up hell below.

464
00:34:33,042 --> 00:34:33,944
As Church said it was.

465
00:34:34,022 --> 00:34:36,343
So they forced him to recant his second book.

466
00:34:36,633 --> 00:34:37,474
But what was this one?

467
00:34:37,494 --> 00:34:39,489
This is how he got the word out.

468
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:41,550
This is the truth. Not what Vatican forced him to write.

469
00:34:42,605 --> 00:34:45,435
Smuggled out of Rome, printed in Holland on setched papyrus. See?

470
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:48,359
That way any scientist that was caught with copy could just

471
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:51,587
throw it in water and Galileo’s heresy would dissolve. Disappear.

472
00:34:52,205 --> 00:34:54,713
Between that and the Vatican burnings...

473
00:34:55,157 --> 00:34:57,857
it’s possible this is the only copy that remains.

474
00:34:58,607 --> 00:35:00,503
And if I am not incorrect...

475
00:35:00,757 --> 00:35:01,757
seniel

476
00:35:01,819 --> 00:35:04,519
is hidden on page number...

477
00:35:05,398 --> 00:35:06,677
5.

478
00:35:07,116 --> 00:35:08,431
Yeah.

479
00:35:14,574 --> 00:35:16,379
Do you need help with the Latin?

480
00:35:17,256 --> 00:35:18,303
Sure.

481
00:35:25,793 --> 00:35:30,066
Movement of the planets, elliptical orbits, idiosyntricity...

482
00:35:32,776 --> 00:35:35,778
Sorry. Don’t think there is anything that could be interpreted as a...

483
00:35:36,408 --> 00:35:37,735
Wait, wait, wait.

484
00:35:37,849 --> 00:35:38,917
Do that again.

485
00:35:41,036 --> 00:35:42,796
What is that?

486
00:35:45,655 --> 00:35:48,050
It is a watermark and there is a line of text.

487
00:35:48,281 --> 00:35:49,681
Go back.

488
00:35:51,867 --> 00:35:53,231
It’s in English.

489
00:35:53,271 --> 00:35:54,903
English? Why English?

490
00:35:56,134 --> 00:35:58,656
English wasn't used in the Vatican.
It was too polluted.

491
00:35:58,741 --> 00:35:59,441
It's free thinking.

492
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:02,672
It was the language of radicals, like Shakespeare and Chaucer.

493
00:36:04,394 --> 00:36:05,594
Here's another one.

494
00:36:05,653 --> 00:36:07,884
"The path of light is laid a sacred test."

495
00:36:08,755 --> 00:36:12,607
- Would you write this down as I dictate?
- Sorry professor, no time.

496
00:36:17,512 --> 00:36:19,315
Yeah, yeah. What the hell. Yeah.

497
00:36:34,964 --> 00:36:37,321
20 minutes till 8. Where are we heading?

498
00:36:37,768 --> 00:36:39,115
Hold on. Hold on. I'll tell in a minute.

499
00:36:39,276 --> 00:36:40,796
Let me see that page again.

500
00:36:46,992 --> 00:36:48,618
Where did you get that paper?

501
00:36:49,402 --> 00:36:50,547
We borrowed it.

502
00:36:50,854 --> 00:36:54,757
- "From Santi's earthly tomb, the demon's hole..."
- Are you insane?

503
00:36:54,959 --> 00:37:00,659
- "across Rome the mystic elements unfold. The path of light is laid in a sacred test."

504
00:37:02,203 --> 00:37:04,846
- "Let angels guide thee on thy lofty quest."

505
00:37:05,902 --> 00:37:08,483
You removed a document from the Vatican archives?

506
00:37:09,067 --> 00:37:10,112
She did.

507
00:37:15,418 --> 00:37:17,103
"From Santi's earthly tomb..."

508
00:37:17,494 --> 00:37:19,757
- The first marker is at Santis tomb.
- Yeah.

509
00:37:20,377 --> 00:37:22,150
- But, but who is Santi?
- Rafael.

510
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:25,284
- Raphael? The sculptor?
- Yeah. Santi was his last name.

511
00:37:25,505 --> 00:37:27,427
So that path starts at Rafael's tomb.

512
00:37:27,652 --> 00:37:29,151
Rafael is buried at the Pantheon.

513
00:37:29,485 --> 00:37:31,046
Isn’t the Pantheon a Church?

514
00:37:31,133 --> 00:37:32,819
The oldest catholic Church in Rome.

515
00:37:51,946 --> 00:37:56,293
I just have chosen my best men for this. You better be right.

516
00:37:56,497 --> 00:37:59,860
This is one of the busiest spot in all of Rome. You can never get away with it. It's impossible.

517
00:38:00,302 --> 00:38:02,265
The poem implies.
- the poem?

518
00:38:02,587 --> 00:38:03,553
Unbelievable.

519
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:08,154
I’m basing this operation on an American interpreter of a 400 year old poem.

520
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:11,035
Well the information we have clearly refers to Raphael's tomb...

521
00:38:11,093 --> 00:38:12,930
And Raphael's tomb is inside that building.

522
00:38:13,265 --> 00:38:16,581
And because the Vatican destroyed all of the pagan statues in late 1800s...

523
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:21,823
if this is the first marker, whatever clues that were here to lead us to the next are sure gone by now...

524
00:38:21,828 --> 00:38:25,122
The path is dead. So this is it. Your only chance.

525
00:38:26,031 --> 00:38:30,174
Separate approaches. No closer than 2 blocks and no uniforms in 3 minutes.

526
00:38:31,196 --> 00:38:32,809
I'll need a set of eyes inside!

527
00:38:37,423 --> 00:38:38,351
Excuse me...

528
00:38:38,439 --> 00:38:41,729
Richter, they wear matching black suites and earpieces. They are hardly disguised.

529
00:38:41,907 --> 00:38:43,740
- That’s what I have.
- Wow. Fine I’m going.

530
00:38:43,841 --> 00:38:47,019
You don’t have communication. You can’t carry a Walkie Talkie. It’s too conspicuous.

531
00:38:47,078 --> 00:38:50,691
- Tourists have cell phones don’t they?
- No. No, you can't send her in there alone.

532
00:38:52,355 --> 00:38:53,923
Alright I won't.

533
00:39:05,436 --> 00:39:07,999
Don’t look so anxious. We're supposed to be married.

534
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:11,266
Well, maybe we are not coming along today. Hmm?

535
00:39:13,421 --> 00:39:15,129
Hold my hand.

536
00:39:16,242 --> 00:39:19,460
- But don’t crush it.
- Sorry, nervous newlywed.

537
00:39:24,058 --> 00:39:26,013
Ooh. Look, honey. The oculus.

538
00:39:26,776 --> 00:39:28,818
That could be the demons hall in the poem.

539
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:30,679
Why are the tombs at an angle?

540
00:39:30,974 --> 00:39:33,161
They are facing east worshiping the rising sun.

541
00:39:33,555 --> 00:39:34,844
But, this is a Christian Church.

542
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:39,234
New religions often adopt the existing customs and holidays to make conversion less of a shock.

543
00:39:40,509 --> 00:39:44,217
Like the 25th of December. It's the pagan's celebration of the unconquered sun.

544
00:39:45,183 --> 00:39:46,883
Also makes a handy date for birth of Christ.

545
00:39:47,637 --> 00:39:50,937
Let's check the recesses. I go to the right. I'll meet you in 180 degrees.

546
00:39:54,714 --> 00:39:55,886
Follow me please.

547
00:39:56,527 --> 00:40:00,022
Now, the Pantheon which means temple of the gods

548
00:40:00,684 --> 00:40:04,357
was originally built as a temple to all the gods of ancient Rome

549
00:40:04,717 --> 00:40:12,099
in 27 B.C.
Although the building is usually credited to Agrippa of Damascus...

550
00:40:13,755 --> 00:40:14,647
Robert!

551
00:40:16,615 --> 00:40:17,935
Robert!

552
00:40:21,524 --> 00:40:23,973
It is the Raphael tomb but it is the wrong one.

553
00:40:24,114 --> 00:40:25,038
What are you talking about?

554
00:40:25,319 --> 00:40:29,262
He was moved here in 1759 a century after the Diagramma was published.

555
00:40:29,629 --> 00:40:31,150
Where was he originally buried?

556
00:40:31,807 --> 00:40:35,807
Genoa I think.
What could posssibly be Santi's earthly tomb?

557
00:40:38,957 --> 00:40:41,257
Damn it! Santi's tomb.

558
00:40:41,453 --> 00:40:43,453
It must mean the Chapel that he built.

559
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:45,992
He's not buried there but he designed it.

560
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:47,126
The demons hall.

561
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:49,670
It’s an undercroft. It’s a crypt.

562
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:53,485
- Any questions?
- Yes. Yes.

563
00:40:54,319 --> 00:41:00,075
Did Raphael Santi ever design a Chapel with an ossuary anex in an angel figure commissioned by the Catholic Church?

564
00:41:01,903 --> 00:41:04,540
I’m sorry, I can only think of one.

565
00:41:05,323 --> 00:41:06,691
One is good.

566
00:41:07,007 --> 00:41:11,293
- Wrong? What do you mean wrong?
- It's the Chigi Chapel in the Church of Santa Maria del Popolo.

567
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:13,765
It was once called Capella della Terra,

568
00:41:13,853 --> 00:41:15,291
the Chapel of the earth.

569
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:17,701
Earth, the first element. That’s it!

570
00:41:17,738 --> 00:41:19,464
- You were certain about the Pantheon.
- We have 4 minutes.

571
00:41:20,207 --> 00:41:23,201
We end this! Let’s go back to Vatican.

572
00:41:23,538 --> 00:41:24,960
Back to the Vatican. But you can’t!

573
00:41:25,139 --> 00:41:27,457
Commandate if you cared all about your Church you listen to me.

574
00:41:27,523 --> 00:41:28,912
My Church?

575
00:41:30,584 --> 00:41:33,308
My Church comforts the sick and dying.

576
00:41:33,351 --> 00:41:36,679
My Church feeds the hungry. What does your Church do, Mr. Langdon?

577
00:41:38,289 --> 00:41:39,561
That’s right, you don’t have one.

578
00:41:42,553 --> 00:41:44,180
Take him if you want. I’m done with him.

579
00:41:56,251 --> 00:41:58,528
Alright this make sense. Look, look right front of the Church.

580
00:41:59,257 --> 00:42:01,221
An obelisk lofty pyramid.

581
00:42:01,481 --> 00:42:03,768
The Egyptian symbol adopted by the Illuminati.

582
00:42:04,201 --> 00:42:05,836
If he's going to kill him he'll do it here.

583
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,505
8 o’clock.

584
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:31,668
The clock.

585
00:42:32,843 --> 00:42:34,253
Robert.

586
00:42:43,585 --> 00:42:45,146
- Its locked.
- Force the gate.

587
00:42:51,584 --> 00:42:54,223
No. No. Here. It's an Annulus.

588
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,700
- Which one is the Chigi Chapel?
- Must be in one of these areas.

589
00:44:30,039 --> 00:44:31,539
Pyramids in the Catholic Church.

590
00:44:32,597 --> 00:44:34,686
This is it. This is the Chigi Chapel.

591
00:44:53,447 --> 00:44:55,245
The Demons Hall.

592
00:44:58,613 --> 00:45:00,949
But it is askew. Come here.

593
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,147
Give me your flashlight.

594
00:45:10,417 --> 00:45:12,224
What is that?

595
00:46:58,972 --> 00:47:01,872
They are voting for themselves to prevent a majority.

596
00:47:01,973 --> 00:47:04,576
They're waiting for the Preferiti to be rescued.

597
00:47:05,846 --> 00:47:08,466
Perhaps we should as well. Yes?

598
00:47:27,269 --> 00:47:29,010
Not until the smoke is white,

599
00:47:29,246 --> 00:47:30,846
will the Colleague of Cardinals have chosen a new Holy Father.

600
00:47:32,603 --> 00:47:36,195
But now the Vatican seat of ultimate power remains vacant.

601
00:47:42,706 --> 00:47:44,296
Get the body out of there.

602
00:47:44,687 --> 00:47:46,025
Search the rest of the building.

603
00:47:46,721 --> 00:47:47,521
Sir.

604
00:47:47,609 --> 00:47:49,683
Outside a perimeter, Secure but invisible.

605
00:47:49,787 --> 00:47:51,981
No light. No guns. Nobody knows. Understand?

606
00:47:52,064 --> 00:47:53,885
- Yes sir.
- Call in all off-duty.

607
00:47:57,063 --> 00:48:00,611
- Is it Rafael?
- The Chapel is Rafael.

608
00:48:02,195 --> 00:48:05,299
But the sculptures are Bernini.

609
00:48:07,455 --> 00:48:10,380
The unknown Illuminati master.

610
00:48:11,163 --> 00:48:12,544
Bernini?

611
00:48:13,221 --> 00:48:14,731
He worked for the Church.

612
00:48:15,237 --> 00:48:17,167
Almost exclusively.

613
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:20,692
But the Illuminati were infiltrators.

614
00:48:21,604 --> 00:48:24,448
There wasn’t a powerful organization on earth they didn’t penetrate

615
00:48:24,504 --> 00:48:26,567
including the Vatican by hiding in plain sight.

616
00:48:31,676 --> 00:48:34,123
Habakkuk and the Angel.

617
00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:37,267
It's the prophet that predicted the annihilation of the earth.

618
00:48:37,616 --> 00:48:40,981
"Let angels guide thee on thy lofty quest."

619
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,040
This is the first marker. The path is alive.

620
00:49:00,982 --> 00:49:02,802
Southwest.

621
00:49:03,222 --> 00:49:04,537
It was pointing southwest.

622
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:09,566
Earth, air, fire, water. We're looking for a Bernini sculpture having something to do with air.

623
00:49:09,658 --> 00:49:12,066
The second Church is somewhere southwest of here.

624
00:49:12,405 --> 00:49:13,695
You are sure this time?

625
00:49:14,099 --> 00:49:16,195
I need a map showing all churches of Rome.

626
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:22,062
I could use it now!

627
00:49:55,759 --> 00:49:59,230
The purple layers with these black crosses represent the churches.

628
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:03,417
But nothing intersects the line until it hits...until it hits St. Peter's.

629
00:50:03,856 --> 00:50:05,897
Michelangelo designed St. Peter's. Not Bernini.

630
00:50:05,944 --> 00:50:08,949
Michelangelo designed the Basilica. Bernini designed St. Peter's Square.

631
00:50:10,314 --> 00:50:12,599
The second marker must be a statue in St. Peter's Square.

632
00:50:18,333 --> 00:50:20,854
It's 10 minutes to 9, can't we go any faster?

633
00:50:21,014 --> 00:50:22,901
Not unless you want full attention of the world press.

634
00:50:30,629 --> 00:50:32,109
St. Peter's.

635
00:50:33,231 --> 00:50:36,831
No majority in the first vote, but Cardinal Baggia from Italy is the clear favorite...

636
00:50:40,258 --> 00:50:45,558
Still no new Pope, but Cardinal Guidera from Spain has the best chance...

637
00:50:47,851 --> 00:50:52,751
The more conceivable candidate could be Cardinal Ebner from Germany...

638
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,160
Stem cell research saves lives!

639
00:51:01,264 --> 00:51:02,464
Man is not God!

640
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:16,071
There, another obelisk.

641
00:51:16,472 --> 00:51:19,092
Check the crowd. It's almost 9. He's got to be here already.

642
00:51:53,093 --> 00:51:54,493
There must be hundreds of statues up there.

643
00:51:55,919 --> 00:51:58,807
None of them are angels. Those are all saints.

644
00:51:59,670 --> 00:52:02,496
How in God’s name could you create a sculpture about air?

645
00:52:12,011 --> 00:52:12,983
Bas relief. Of course.

646
00:52:13,322 --> 00:52:15,966
It’s still a sculpture. Check the ground. Look at the carvings.

647
00:52:16,503 --> 00:52:19,525
Look for another something to do with air.

648
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:40,638
Vento Ponente. West Wind.

649
00:52:42,521 --> 00:52:44,257
Vittoria. Here it is.

650
00:52:46,139 --> 00:52:48,892
West wind. An angel blowing in 5 streaks of air.

651
00:52:49,202 --> 00:52:50,331
This is it.

652
00:54:05,913 --> 00:54:07,713
He's still alive.

653
00:54:21,737 --> 00:54:23,737
His chest.
They punctured his lungs.

654
00:55:41,082 --> 00:55:43,237
"And you squeezed the life out of a bishop of Rome."

655
00:55:43,295 --> 00:55:45,642
He's actually claiming responsibility for the death of His Holiness.

656
00:55:46,627 --> 00:55:48,166
That’s rediculous. He died of the stroke.

657
00:55:49,746 --> 00:55:52,225
It implies Illuminati murder of him with his medication.

658
00:55:52,762 --> 00:55:54,051
What?

659
00:55:55,133 --> 00:55:56,454
Down here.

660
00:55:56,930 --> 00:55:58,230
"With man's solution we stilled his heart."

661
00:56:00,234 --> 00:56:03,539
"With his own needle did we pierce his unholy vein."

662
00:56:03,850 --> 00:56:07,106
Did the Holy Father take any kind of medication by injection?

663
00:56:07,199 --> 00:56:08,209
Tinzaparin.

664
00:56:09,346 --> 00:56:13,410
He had thrombophlebitis. He took injection every day but no one knew that.

665
00:56:14,157 --> 00:56:15,377
Someone knew.

666
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:17,708
He had health concern and seizures as well.

667
00:56:18,823 --> 00:56:20,502
But he took steps to make sure he was watched

668
00:56:21,185 --> 00:56:22,536
for safety.

669
00:56:22,627 --> 00:56:24,862
He didn’t want it made public so we have no reason to discuss.

670
00:56:25,251 --> 00:56:27,943
Tinzaparin is lethal in wrong doses.

671
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:31,568
An overdose could cause massive internal bleeding and brain hemmorhages.

672
00:56:32,354 --> 00:56:35,534
It may look stroke at first but in a few days his body would show signs.

673
00:56:35,783 --> 00:56:37,179
This could easily be examined.

674
00:56:37,285 --> 00:56:41,267
Miss Vetra in case you are not aware of it, Papal autopsy is prohibited by Vatican law.

675
00:56:42,542 --> 00:56:44,355
You are not going to defile His Holiness' body

676
00:56:45,279 --> 00:56:47,277
- just because of these claims.
- Why would they send this letter now?

677
00:56:47,791 --> 00:56:48,958
To cause panic.

678
00:56:49,593 --> 00:56:51,451
The sun will blind at midnight

679
00:56:51,884 --> 00:56:53,892
and neither police or professors can stop it.

680
00:56:54,908 --> 00:56:56,257
He knows I’m here.

681
00:56:56,599 --> 00:56:59,033
Oblivious they're hoping this letter would became public.

682
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:01,153
We might be wise to preempt their next attempt

683
00:57:01,246 --> 00:57:03,163
by making an announcement of our own.

684
00:57:03,209 --> 00:57:05,367
- To refute this absurd claim.
- That’s out of question.

685
00:57:06,368 --> 00:57:09,060
Cardinal Strauss insist this entire matter kept internal.

686
00:57:09,629 --> 00:57:11,706
He shouldn't be aware of it. He's locked in Conclave.

687
00:57:11,895 --> 00:57:14,776
His final instructions before sealing the doors were very clear.

688
00:57:15,901 --> 00:57:18,362
Cardinal Strauss does not dictate Vatican protocols.

689
00:57:18,894 --> 00:57:21,457
And to say, yet, technically, now that Conclave has begun,

690
00:57:22,935 --> 00:57:25,065
it is privilege and duty to control public announcements.

691
00:57:25,837 --> 00:57:28,550
I've drafted a press release about incident at the piazza

692
00:57:28,649 --> 00:57:31,426
but any other statements specifically prohibited.

693
00:57:32,170 --> 00:57:36,310
For that, Cardinal has asked me to remind you we have a chimney.

694
00:57:40,261 --> 00:57:42,735
Commander Richter... the search for the device.

695
00:57:43,456 --> 00:57:46,839
We've turned the power on and off about 20 percent of the Vatican city.

696
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:49,653
- Nothing on the video yet.
- We are running out of options.

697
00:57:49,766 --> 00:57:51,724
How long would you need to evacuate everyone?

698
00:57:51,899 --> 00:57:54,489
If I pull all my men from the search for the bomb, 30 minutes.

699
00:57:56,104 --> 00:57:58,858
Mr. Langdon you have been right so far about the path.

700
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:01,766
It’s now 9:15 how quickly can you find the next Church.

701
00:58:02,439 --> 00:58:05,210
The lines of breath on carving pointed due east directly away from Vatican City.

702
00:58:05,714 --> 00:58:07,951
But there are 5 of them so there's room for error.

703
00:58:08,371 --> 00:58:10,471
About 20 churches intercept those lines.

704
00:58:11,081 --> 00:58:12,481
None of them have names include fire.

705
00:58:12,759 --> 00:58:15,459
So the Bernini sculpture must be inside one of them that does.

706
00:58:15,893 --> 00:58:17,393
I need to get back into archives to find it.

707
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:19,539
- Would you escort Mr. Langdon?
- Yes Father.

708
00:58:22,535 --> 00:58:25,335
Silvano's journals... the killer's name could be in here.

709
00:58:26,233 --> 00:58:28,633
- Can I stay?
- Please, Fine. Of course.

710
00:58:30,303 --> 00:58:31,703
Professor.

711
00:58:32,953 --> 00:58:34,953
Where you surprised to find those clothes suite you.

712
00:58:36,575 --> 00:58:38,075
It would surprise the hell out of me.

713
00:58:55,575 --> 00:58:58,075
The Vatican expressed its sympathy with the families of the victim.

714
00:58:58,575 --> 00:58:61,075
A tourist from Düsseldorf, whose death is confirmed.

715
00:58:61,575 --> 00:58:64,075
Vatican police have arrested a suspect...

716
00:59:05,575 --> 00:59:07,820
The investigation is completed.

717
00:59:07,830 --> 00:59:15,075
Vatican will permit access to St. Peter's again, with strict security measures.

718
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:19,504
The Vatican did admit that, where there are crowds, so often follows crime.

719
00:59:20,004 --> 00:59:23,504
We're trying now to get the name of the tourist who was...

720
00:59:23,504 --> 00:59:24,504
But wait...

721
00:59:25,891 --> 00:59:28,791
We're getting word of smoke, smoke from the Sistine Chapel chimney

722
00:59:30,331 --> 00:59:32,831
Apparently theres been a
another vote, the smoke is black.

723
00:59:34,148 --> 00:59:39,170
Once again the Cardinals have failed to reach consensus and the Catholic Church remains without a leader.

724
00:59:48,061 --> 00:59:49,830
What are you looking for?

725
00:59:50,687 --> 00:59:52,612
- Church assets.
- I beg your pardon.

726
00:59:53,933 --> 00:59:55,675
Art work is valuable.

727
00:59:56,247 --> 00:59:58,412
Corporations tend to keep track of their holdings.

728
00:59:59,517 --> 01:00:02,750
The Catholic Church is not a corporation. It's a beacon.

729
01:00:02,751 --> 01:00:07,122
A source of inspiration for one billion lost and frightened souls.

730
01:00:07,123 --> 01:00:08,423
- Sure I get that. It’s also a bank.

731
01:00:19,499 --> 01:00:22,970
Commandate Olivetti said not leave out of site this time.

732
01:00:25,223 --> 01:00:27,235
It wasn’t me. It was her.

733
01:00:44,223 --> 01:00:45,243
The flow in Zone 3 is disabled.

734
01:00:46,723 --> 01:00:47,643
No response on the screen.

735
01:00:48,723 --> 01:00:51,003
Flow in Zone 3 again and continue to Zone 4.

736
01:01:02,018 --> 01:01:03,705
What sort of signs?

737
01:01:04,741 --> 01:01:06,363
I’m sorry.

738
01:01:10,349 --> 01:01:13,069
If the Holy Father was given an overdose of zansiban.

739
01:01:14,399 --> 01:01:16,396
What signs would his body bare?

740
01:01:17,675 --> 01:01:20,000
Bleeding of the oral mucosa.

741
01:01:21,670 --> 01:01:22,670
His tongue.

742
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:28,000
Post-mortem, the blood congeals, then turns the inside of the mouth black.

743
01:01:28,924 --> 01:01:30,324
Even after 14 days?

744
01:01:31,268 --> 01:01:33,868
It wouldn't show up at least a week after his death.

745
01:01:38,772 --> 01:01:40,172
It’s very important to me.

746
01:01:42,612 --> 01:01:44,112
Yeah I understand.

747
01:01:49,074 --> 01:01:50,374
Will you come with me please?

748
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,657
Signore, would you organize a security team to escort Ms. Vetra and myself down to the crypt?

749
01:02:02,657 --> 01:02:04,317
- Yes, sir.
- We'll leave immediately.

750
01:02:24,017 --> 01:02:25,258
Do you smoke?

751
01:02:26,194 --> 01:02:27,163
A little bit.

752
01:02:28,774 --> 01:02:31,652
You better sit down before you keel over.

753
01:02:37,536 --> 01:02:39,254
What does this say in English?

754
01:02:39,943 --> 01:02:42,465
Ecstasy of Saint Theresa. Right there.

755
01:02:44,917 --> 01:02:46,355
Moved at suggestion of the artist.

756
01:02:47,936 --> 01:02:51,072
Moved to another Church. At the suggestion of Bernini?

757
01:02:51,379 --> 01:02:52,348
I don’t know.

758
01:02:55,185 --> 01:02:58,045
Here. Translate all of this for me.

759
01:02:58,374 --> 01:03:02,002
I’ll buy you a pack of smokes. I’m looking for references to a fire.

760
01:03:05,259 --> 01:03:07,270
- Seraphim, meaning the fiery one.
- Right.

761
01:03:09,426 --> 01:03:11,850
This great golden spear.

762
01:03:12,484 --> 01:03:14,489
A point of fire.

763
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:19,963
Then "Woman left completely afire."

764
01:03:21,762 --> 01:03:23,255
The ecstasy of Saint Theresa. St. Teresa on fire.

765
01:03:23,744 --> 01:03:27,020
So this sculpture was moved to this Church?

766
01:03:27,829 --> 01:03:29,562
Why'd they shut down the system? They know that we are down here.

767
01:03:31,107 --> 01:03:33,505
If there's no power, there's no oxygen.

768
01:03:34,906 --> 01:03:36,869
- Can we get out the door?
- It's electronic.

769
01:03:41,128 --> 01:03:43,001
Well, that’s disappointing.

770
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:46,556
- Where are we going?
- To see my father.

771
01:03:48,038 --> 01:03:49,429
I do not understand.

772
01:03:49,632 --> 01:03:52,206
I was in orphan when I was 9 years of age.

773
01:03:52,425 --> 01:03:55,919
A bombing in Ulster, the UVF protesting the visit of a Catholic Archbishop.

774
01:03:57,339 --> 01:03:59,002
The Archbishop felt responsible and he adopted me the following day.

775
01:03:59,029 --> 01:04:01,028
And he adopted me following day.

776
01:04:01,951 --> 01:04:04,140
I was raised by him and by the Church.

777
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:05,924
He is the wisest man I have ever met.

778
01:04:07,737 --> 01:04:09,382
Even when I was young and stubborn,

779
01:04:09,504 --> 01:04:11,545
I wanted to be ordained...

780
01:04:12,639 --> 01:04:14,839
but I was brought up in Italy, so l also wanted to do my military service.

781
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:16,717
I wanted to fight...

782
01:04:17,053 --> 01:04:19,888
He told me, "Learn to fly."

783
01:04:20,264 --> 01:04:23,330
So, I joined the Aeronautica Militare. Flew helicopters.

784
01:04:23,726 --> 01:04:27,189
Bringing the wounded back to hospitals. He was a great man.

785
01:04:27,799 --> 01:04:30,020
Your father died?

786
01:04:30,579 --> 01:04:31,722
14 days ago.

787
01:04:39,969 --> 01:04:43,642
- Can you get anything?
- No. The walls are lead-lined. There is no signal.

788
01:07:59,583 --> 01:08:00,949
This way.

789
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:11,260
If the Holy Father was murdered...

790
01:08:11,371 --> 01:08:13,652
the implication is profound.

791
01:08:13,733 --> 01:08:15,486
Vatican security is impenetrable.

792
01:08:15,818 --> 01:08:17,885
No one from outside could get near him.

793
01:08:19,065 --> 01:08:20,566
It was someone who is inside.

794
01:08:20,872 --> 01:08:22,336
Then we cannot trust no one.

795
01:08:24,346 --> 01:08:27,906
On my screen, no response in Zone 7.

796
01:08:27,916 --> 01:08:31,716
With all these power cuts, the battery will soon be empty...

797
01:08:32,726 --> 01:08:34,986
The device will explode at midnight.

798
01:08:56,016 --> 01:08:57,723
Holy Father...

799
01:08:58,802 --> 01:09:02,002
when I was young you told me the voice in my heart was God's voice...

800
01:09:03,050 --> 01:09:05,649
You said I should follow it no matter how painful...

801
01:09:05,970 --> 01:09:09,866
Forgive me. Please give me strength.

802
01:09:12,093 --> 01:09:15,555
What I do, I do in the name of everything you believe.

803
01:10:21,276 --> 01:10:23,076
Santa Maria del Vittoria. Do you know it?

804
01:10:24,219 --> 01:10:26,019
- Yes I do.
- It's the next Church.

805
01:10:43,126 --> 01:10:44,569
I think someone just tried to kill me.

806
01:10:44,780 --> 01:10:46,705
Professor, I promise you, we had no idea.

807
01:10:46,773 --> 01:10:47,844
- He knows I’m here.
- Yes.

808
01:10:47,901 --> 01:10:49,528
You heard me ask permission. You gave me an escort.

809
01:10:49,579 --> 01:10:53,619
Yes, but we had no idea that portions of our white zones were crosswired with that building.

810
01:10:55,435 --> 01:10:57,135
Commander Richter was extending the search.

811
01:10:57,195 --> 01:10:58,395
If he had known the archives were on that grid

812
01:10:58,490 --> 01:10:59,690
he would never have killed the power.

813
01:11:01,413 --> 01:11:03,053
But there is the other possibility.

814
01:11:03,687 --> 01:11:08,841
Is it conceivable the Illuminati have... infiltrated the Swiss Guard?

815
01:11:12,237 --> 01:11:13,456
Perhaps.

816
01:11:23,524 --> 01:11:25,430
The journals, where are they?

817
01:11:27,792 --> 01:11:29,979
Who took the journals from this desk?

818
01:11:41,468 --> 01:11:43,133
Signore, this is unacceptable...

819
01:11:43,633 --> 01:11:46,378
for a Camerlengo to enter the Chapel once Conclave has begun.

820
01:11:46,388 --> 01:11:49,896
Forgive me, there's been a development.

821
01:12:05,583 --> 01:12:09,583
Signori, please, a moment. Please. Signori.

822
01:12:12,386 --> 01:12:14,289
Our Church is at war.

823
01:12:16,039 --> 01:12:18,517
We are under attack from an old enemy.

824
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:20,961
The Illuminati.

825
01:12:21,739 --> 01:12:23,647
They have struck us from within.

826
01:12:24,099 --> 01:12:25,580
Murdering our Holy Father...

827
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:29,734
And threatening us all with destruction at the hands of their new God 'Science'.

828
01:12:31,398 --> 01:12:34,118
They call it retribution. They think they are justified.

829
01:12:34,420 --> 01:12:38,088
Because of the Church attacks on the men of science in the distant past...and it’s true...

830
01:12:39,460 --> 01:12:43,581
Since the days of Galileo this Church has tried to slow the relentless march of progress.

831
01:12:44,695 --> 01:12:47,457
Sometimes with misguided means.

832
01:12:48,392 --> 01:12:50,511
But science and religion are not enemies.

833
01:12:51,620 --> 01:12:56,401
There are simply some things that science is just too young to understand.

834
01:12:57,119 --> 01:12:59,452
So the Church pleads, "Stop."

835
01:12:59,663 --> 01:13:01,561
"Slow down. Think. Wait"

836
01:13:02,371 --> 01:13:04,020
For this they call us backward.

837
01:13:05,106 --> 01:13:09,654
But who is more ignorant? The man who cannot define the lightning...

838
01:13:09,693 --> 01:13:12,241
or the man who does not respect its natural awesome power?

839
01:13:14,194 --> 01:13:16,200
The battle is well on their way Signori.

840
01:13:16,790 --> 01:13:18,462
We must defend ourselves.

841
01:13:19,181 --> 01:13:21,108
But, what if this time, we fight their stealth with openness?

842
01:13:21,181 --> 01:13:23,808
Combat their wicked scheme with simple truth.

843
01:13:24,565 --> 01:13:27,624
And end this brutish battle once and for all...

844
01:13:27,938 --> 01:13:30,455
If the outside world could
see this Church as I do...

845
01:13:30,709 --> 01:13:32,036
looking beyond rituals these walls...

846
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:35,489
they would see a modern miracle.

847
01:13:36,529 --> 01:13:38,982
A Brotherhood of imperfect simple souls...

848
01:13:39,099 --> 01:13:41,596
who want nothing more than to be voices of compassion...

849
01:13:41,690 --> 01:13:44,218
in a world spinning out of control.

850
01:13:46,798 --> 01:13:50,830
Signori I ask, l pray...

851
01:13:52,819 --> 01:13:54,319
that you break this Conclave.

852
01:13:55,901 --> 01:14:00,001
Open the doors. Evacuate St. Peter's Square.

853
01:14:00,595 --> 01:14:02,635
And tell the world the truth.

854
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:39,234
Get him down.

855
01:14:51,244 --> 01:14:52,644
There. There, that chain. On that pulley.

856
01:14:52,645 --> 01:14:55,516
This bench. Get this pew off here and make it a ladder.

857
01:16:17,037 --> 01:16:18,537
Vatican Police.

858
01:17:20,644 --> 01:17:26,331
My son. God answers all prayers, but...

859
01:17:26,341 --> 01:17:30,015
Sometimes His answer is no.

860
01:17:31,665 --> 01:17:33,896
Colleague will not break Conclave...

861
01:17:35,148 --> 01:17:40,068
May I suggest that you direct your energies to helping the Swiss Guard find...

862
01:17:40,628 --> 01:17:42,028
this explosive device...

863
01:17:42,742 --> 01:17:47,620
if it exists. And leave
Church leadership...

864
01:17:49,722 --> 01:17:51,024
to it's leaders.

865
01:18:03,674 --> 01:18:05,064
Eminence.

866
01:18:07,453 --> 01:18:09,220
There is a growing fear.

867
01:18:10,166 --> 01:18:14,866
That without the 4 Preferiti it defers much authority for any candidate.

868
01:18:15,285 --> 01:18:17,633
It will be not possible unless...

869
01:18:17,995 --> 01:18:19,856
Speak plainly.

870
01:18:21,426 --> 01:18:25,826
It is our recommendations to ask you to be removed from your post as great elector.

871
01:18:27,352 --> 01:18:29,798
Thereby making you self eligible...

872
01:18:31,083 --> 01:18:34,164
to wear the Ring of the Fisherman.

873
01:18:34,750 --> 01:18:38,340
Well, maybe it is God’s will.

874
01:18:46,257 --> 01:18:48,453
His will be done.

875
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:03,750
Here! I hear someone. Here!

876
01:19:05,231 --> 01:19:06,093
Remove the lid!

877
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,073
Come on! Come on!

878
01:19:14,422 --> 01:19:16,022
Signore are you okay?

879
01:19:41,342 --> 01:19:43,442
Those journals are private property. I demand that you return them to me.

880
01:19:44,237 --> 01:19:46,037
Material evidence in a Vatican investigation.

881
01:19:49,646 --> 01:19:53,246
I’m an Italian citizen. My rights don’t end because I crossed to the other side.

882
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:55,600
This is not it. Its not even Rome. It's Vatican.

883
01:19:56,896 --> 01:20:00,096
Country of its own. With its own laws. When those journals pass the border...

884
01:20:00,829 --> 01:20:02,829
they become my property l will give them back to you

885
01:20:03,922 --> 01:20:06,522
when I decide they contain nothing of value to this investigation.

886
01:20:07,251 --> 01:20:08,851
Do you have something to hide Commandante Richter?

887
01:20:12,451 --> 01:20:15,379
Do you Dr. Vetra?

888
01:20:35,326 --> 01:20:37,223
If it were up to me. you wouldn't be this way...

889
01:20:40,036 --> 01:20:41,504
It’s a sin to kill with pain.

890
01:20:43,765 --> 01:20:46,191
It's a sin to kill without reason, Father.

891
01:20:51,889 --> 01:20:53,471
They made me a sinner.

892
01:21:12,806 --> 01:21:14,275
St. Teresa on fire.

893
01:21:18,226 --> 01:21:19,624
Professor Landon?

894
01:21:20,732 --> 01:21:22,057
What direction is that?

895
01:21:22,148 --> 01:21:22,974
West I think.

896
01:21:23,007 --> 01:21:24,809
"Across Rome the mystic elements unfold."

897
01:21:27,330 --> 01:21:31,417
Piazza Barba Rini is here. Saint Theresa is here.

898
01:21:32,754 --> 01:21:35,296
Where is the Santa Maria del Popolo the first altar of science?

899
01:21:35,327 --> 01:21:36,829
- Santa Maria del Popolo?
- Yes.

900
01:21:37,451 --> 01:21:38,165
Here.

901
01:21:38,540 --> 01:21:39,524
Thank you.

902
01:21:40,967 --> 01:21:42,258
St. Peter's is here.

903
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:44,426
We are here.

904
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:46,950
A Church with water.

905
01:21:50,498 --> 01:21:51,751
Wait. Wait. Wait.

906
01:21:52,079 --> 01:21:53,063
Across Rome.

907
01:21:55,543 --> 01:21:57,605
The poem must mean it literally across Rome.

908
01:21:57,635 --> 01:22:01,583
Prof. Landon, Commander Richter has ordered me to escort you to Vatican immediately.

909
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:08,108
Piazza Navona. Earth, air, fire, water cross Rome.

910
01:22:09,085 --> 01:22:10,086
Briminis 4 rivers.

911
01:22:11,846 --> 01:22:15,306
Professor Langdon. Commander Richter has ordered me to escort you to the Vatican immediately.

912
01:22:15,362 --> 01:22:17,201
Vatican is about to see the 4th Cardinal that.

913
01:22:17,709 --> 01:22:18,739
Now look.

914
01:22:19,856 --> 01:22:22,909
You can do as they say and force me back to Vatican...

915
01:22:23,272 --> 01:22:24,497
We can all mourn his death together...

916
01:22:24,596 --> 01:22:27,584
or you could show how real cops act...

917
01:22:27,695 --> 01:22:31,036
and take me to piazza divine where we still might able to stop it.

918
01:22:34,685 --> 01:22:36,576
Oh, by all means let’s talk it over.

919
01:22:37,392 --> 01:22:40,270
In 14 minutes he's going to be dead.

920
01:22:55,467 --> 01:22:57,132
Yes Padre.

921
01:22:57,205 --> 01:22:59,874
At 11:15 if the Church is still in peril

922
01:23:01,158 --> 01:23:03,518
give the order to evacuate the Cardinals...

923
01:23:04,639 --> 01:23:09,574
but with dignity. Let them walk out St. Peters Square with heads held high...

924
01:23:10,454 --> 01:23:15,027
I don’t want the last image of the Church to be of frightened old men sneaking out of the back door.

925
01:23:31,382 --> 01:23:33,949
"Where the angels guide thee..."

926
01:23:38,864 --> 01:23:40,864
There it is. There it is.

927
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:43,200
Professor I know this fountain. There is no angel on it.

928
01:23:43,330 --> 01:23:44,530
The dove...

929
01:23:44,531 --> 01:23:45,531
The angel of peace...

930
01:23:46,233 --> 01:23:47,733
It’s looking in what direction?

931
01:23:48,264 --> 01:23:49,764
East I think.

932
01:24:01,207 --> 01:24:02,207
Professor just wait here...

933
01:24:02,894 --> 01:24:03,894
stay put.

934
01:24:33,336 --> 01:24:34,336
Turn off your engine.

935
01:25:42,542 --> 01:25:44,942
Hey!

936
01:25:58,317 --> 01:25:59,317
Help!

937
01:25:59,434 --> 01:26:01,815
Somebody help!

938
01:26:37,979 --> 01:26:39,962
Help! Somebody.

939
01:27:56,180 --> 01:27:58,541
Where was he hiding you?

940
01:27:58,604 --> 01:28:00,903
The Church of Illumination, where is it?

941
01:28:03,036 --> 01:28:05,057
San Angelo

942
01:28:05,839 --> 01:28:07,962
Castle of the angel.

943
01:28:28,605 --> 01:28:31,505
Sir, there is news about Cardinal Batia.

944
01:28:32,282 --> 01:28:34,882
The Cardinal told Langdon he was being held in castle St. Angelo...

945
01:28:35,677 --> 01:28:38,672
If Langdon’s right, that’s where the bomb is.

946
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:41,588
- send everyone we can spare.
- And you?

947
01:28:41,673 --> 01:28:43,644
I’m staying here.

948
01:28:55,755 --> 01:28:58,423
Vittoria.

949
01:28:58,451 --> 01:29:00,489
- Are you are alright?
- I’m alright. Yes. What about you?

950
01:29:00,544 --> 01:29:02,444
- I just heard about Olivetti on the radio.
- C’mon I’m okay.

951
01:29:08,786 --> 01:29:12,348
Robert, we can’t trust Richter he took Silvano's journals.

952
01:29:12,475 --> 01:29:14,836
There must be something in there he doesn’t want us to see.

953
01:29:14,861 --> 01:29:17,540
The head of the Swiss Guard.

954
01:29:18,670 --> 01:29:21,770
Castle of St. Angelo is close enough... So the wireless signal from that camera

955
01:29:21,907 --> 01:29:22,907
still reaches Vatican.

956
01:29:24,836 --> 01:29:27,821
The Church of The Illumination is somewhere in here.

957
01:29:27,830 --> 01:29:30,395
Your canister's inside it.

958
01:29:49,553 --> 01:29:50,678
Come with me.

959
01:29:55,224 --> 01:29:58,241
For 400 years Illuminati met under the Church's nose.

960
01:29:58,512 --> 01:30:01,422
Tthe Vatican used it as hideout and prison for their enemies.

961
01:30:01,562 --> 01:30:04,759
If an explosion happens here blast radius takes out Vatican

962
01:30:06,339 --> 01:30:08,771
entire Rome with it.

963
01:30:26,161 --> 01:30:28,376
They are pointing it to the angels. Canister must be down there.

964
01:31:16,303 --> 01:31:18,684
- Where are they going?
- Back to search outer castle.

965
01:31:19,020 --> 01:31:21,220
No. It’s got to be here.

966
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:27,533
Robert it's dead-end.

967
01:31:27,606 --> 01:31:29,601
No it's not.

968
01:31:30,001 --> 01:31:31,774
See if you can find a flashlight.

969
01:31:48,498 --> 01:31:50,684
All of these stones are rectangular granite.

970
01:31:51,101 --> 01:31:52,601
Except right here. What is this?

971
01:31:57,502 --> 01:31:58,702
It’s a pentagram.

972
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,500
- An eye...

973
01:32:00,501 --> 01:32:02,500
that leads to...

974
01:32:02,550 --> 01:32:03,230
Nowhere.

975
01:32:12,692 --> 01:32:13,692
Robert.

976
01:32:16,033 --> 01:32:17,933
These walls overlap. Passage way is in here.

977
01:32:18,030 --> 01:32:19,630
Here. Give me the flashlight.

978
01:32:42,026 --> 01:32:45,000
It’s a passage way that leads to Vatican.

979
01:32:45,936 --> 01:32:47,500
An ancient escape route.

980
01:32:49,393 --> 01:32:50,500
My God.

981
01:32:53,631 --> 01:32:55,031
Here.

982
01:32:57,437 --> 01:32:59,037
Look.

983
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Final payment in Volkswagen
Key taped driver's side front wheel

984
01:33:29,911 --> 01:33:32,211
Get on the radio. Get the word out.

985
01:33:32,898 --> 01:33:34,298
Conclave remain sealed.

986
01:33:34,778 --> 01:33:37,678
- But Camerlengo gave the order for the evacuation.
- I’m counter-demanding it.

987
01:33:43,875 --> 01:33:46,304
This is it, this is the Church.

988
01:33:48,209 --> 01:33:50,989
The canister should be lit by artificial light.

989
01:34:14,103 --> 01:34:18,007
- It is not here, Robert.
- Shining star at end of the path. It has to be.

990
01:34:18,099 --> 01:34:19,673
It’s not here.

991
01:34:19,795 --> 01:34:21,095
- What does the poem say?
- Nothing.

992
01:34:22,224 --> 01:34:26,523
I think it’s all over. There are
just 4 lines each one describing...

993
01:34:36,037 --> 01:34:39,555
There is a fifth brand. It’s not an ambigram. Just crossed keys.

994
01:34:40,197 --> 01:34:44,111
- symbol for the Vatican.
- No. For the Papacy.

995
01:34:45,070 --> 01:34:47,900
They intend to kill him.

996
01:34:48,754 --> 01:34:49,850
They are going to kill Pope themselves.

997
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,000
There is no Pope.

998
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,890
"Tempo Sede Vacante."

999
01:34:53,894 --> 01:34:55,494
Camerlengo.

1000
01:34:57,940 --> 01:34:59,815
Take step back please.

1001
01:35:00,917 --> 01:35:02,648
Take the cell from your pocket.

1002
01:35:06,344 --> 01:35:09,293
Throw them to the fire.

1003
01:35:18,706 --> 01:35:20,556
Murderer.

1004
01:35:20,593 --> 01:35:23,128
You know when they call me...

1005
01:35:23,153 --> 01:35:24,516
and they call me.

1006
01:35:25,270 --> 01:35:28,697
It is so important to them that I know that what they ask...

1007
01:35:28,742 --> 01:35:30,142
is the Lord's will,

1008
01:35:30,821 --> 01:35:32,321
Or Allah's. Or Yahweh's.

1009
01:35:34,555 --> 01:35:35,555
I suppose they are right.

1010
01:35:40,210 --> 01:35:43,910
Because if it was not vengeance l wouldn’t exist now would I?

1011
01:35:45,065 --> 01:35:47,480
I've had several chances to eliminate you tonight.

1012
01:35:47,745 --> 01:35:49,645
You are still alive because you have no weapons.

1013
01:35:49,731 --> 01:35:51,131
And they didn’t ask me to kill you.

1014
01:35:51,325 --> 01:35:54,125
But, if you pursue me it is another matter.

1015
01:36:01,018 --> 01:36:02,497
Be careful.

1016
01:36:03,195 --> 01:36:05,760
These are men of God.

1017
01:36:16,702 --> 01:36:18,735
We can’t let him go.

1018
01:36:26,673 --> 01:36:29,103
Have you come to make me a martyr?

1019
01:36:36,260 --> 01:36:37,644
Here, here.

1020
01:38:01,703 --> 01:38:04,375
- I need to see the Camerlengo.
- He's not available.

1021
01:38:04,498 --> 01:38:06,164
- I demand to see Camerlengo
- He's not available.

1022
01:38:07,804 --> 01:38:09,664
We'll see about that.

1023
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
It's a chiusa chiave. It's a one way portal.

1024
01:38:21,100 --> 01:38:23,164
The only entrance is on the other side.

1025
01:38:24,472 --> 01:38:26,597
Hey!

1026
01:38:29,518 --> 01:38:31,092
Open the door!

1027
01:38:49,176 --> 01:38:51,240
Camerlengo is in danger!

1028
01:39:03,635 --> 01:39:06,628
He's the one. He has a gun.

1029
01:39:10,324 --> 01:39:11,334
Illumati!

1030
01:39:11,470 --> 01:39:12,933
- you Bastard.
- Illumati!

1031
01:39:22,867 --> 01:39:25,046
- Padre.
- Order the evacuation.

1032
01:39:26,262 --> 01:39:27,862
We only have 19 minutes.

1033
01:39:32,967 --> 01:39:36,000
And get the helicopter for the older Cardinals. Right. Yes, sir.

1034
01:39:49,015 --> 01:39:53,274
Robert, the brand symbol could have another meaning.

1035
01:40:00,026 --> 01:40:02,340
The keys. Those were upside down.

1036
01:40:02,485 --> 01:40:06,505
- St. Peter.
- The first Pope.

1037
01:40:07,834 --> 01:40:09,943
He was crucified upside down.

1038
01:40:10,077 --> 01:40:12,286
- On Vatican Hill.
- Few hundred feet below us.

1039
01:40:12,305 --> 01:40:13,605
Necropolis. City of the Dead...

1040
01:40:13,900 --> 01:40:16,000
"Upon this rock, I will build my Church."

1041
01:40:16,041 --> 01:40:17,941
"Or bring it down upon itself."

1042
01:40:19,269 --> 01:40:21,800
The bomb. It is in St. Peter's tomb.

1043
01:40:36,906 --> 01:40:40,163
The grid is still cycling. The power to this section must be down.

1044
01:41:26,054 --> 01:41:28,468
It must be here. It must be.

1045
01:41:39,851 --> 01:41:41,565
Don’t touch it.

1046
01:41:42,527 --> 01:41:44,894
We have 7 minutes.

1047
01:41:49,727 --> 01:41:51,527
Robert, hold this.

1048
01:42:31,006 --> 01:42:33,134
It's cold down here, isn’t it?

1049
01:42:33,768 --> 01:42:35,035
What's wrong?

1050
01:42:35,212 --> 01:42:38,350
The cold decreases battery life.

1051
01:42:40,159 --> 01:42:42,043
So we may have less than 5 minutes.

1052
01:42:42,057 --> 01:42:43,057
So.

1053
01:42:43,902 --> 01:42:46,260
If I pull the power with less than 5 minutes...

1054
01:42:46,300 --> 01:42:48,300
the residual charge won’t hold the suspension.

1055
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:53,195
We should leave it here and get clear if we can.

1056
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:54,273
At least down here the damage...

1057
01:42:54,275 --> 01:42:57,000
- No!
- Father!

1058
01:42:59,978 --> 01:43:04,087
We are live here at St. Peter's Square. Where despite a bomb threat...

1059
01:43:04,316 --> 01:43:07,489
and orderly evacuation the crowd is actually growing in size...

1060
01:43:08,137 --> 01:43:11,341
as we wait for an official announcement from the Vatican spokesmen...

1061
01:43:11,518 --> 01:43:12,618
for the exact nature of the threat...

1062
01:43:13,054 --> 01:43:16,265
and whether or not they are treating it as credible danger.

1063
01:43:24,147 --> 01:43:25,521
This way!

1064
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:56,500
He's got a bomb with him.

1065
01:43:56,500 --> 01:43:59,000
A bomb?

1066
01:44:03,534 --> 01:44:05,734
Roberto this is an emergency, l'll take her up alone.

1067
01:44:10,532 --> 01:44:12,771
He's got clearance.

1068
01:44:36,661 --> 01:44:38,961
Oh, my God!

1069
01:46:35,420 --> 01:46:37,220
Get down.

1070
01:49:22,163 --> 01:49:24,474
Cardinal Strauss...

1071
01:49:24,544 --> 01:49:25,544
It was the Camerlengo. He has saved us all.

1072
01:49:28,544 --> 01:49:29,544
He has saved the Church and he's still alive.

1073
01:49:30,829 --> 01:49:32,629
He is alive.

1074
01:49:33,253 --> 01:49:34,553
Praise God. Praise God,

1075
01:49:40,295 --> 01:49:42,388
He's alive.

1076
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,700
He sacrificed himself for all of us.

1077
01:50:11,901 --> 01:50:15,645
You know that worst thing we thought that could happen

1078
01:50:15,751 --> 01:50:19,520
was that our work would fall into the hands of the energy companies.

1079
01:50:21,535 --> 01:50:23,696
We thought we could change the world...

1080
01:50:24,752 --> 01:50:26,052
So naive.

1081
01:50:26,094 --> 01:50:28,725
No. Not naive.

1082
01:50:29,473 --> 01:50:31,520
Innocent maybe.

1083
01:50:31,926 --> 01:50:34,113
But... it's not a crime.

1084
01:50:35,109 --> 01:50:37,038
I’m not so sure.

1085
01:50:38,686 --> 01:50:41,596
Go back to work.

1086
01:50:41,772 --> 01:50:44,639
Change the world.

1087
01:51:08,750 --> 01:51:11,999
The Carmelengo's age is
insufficient and he's just a priest.

1088
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:17,250
Signori, you are no doubt aware of the Holy Law of man that he is inelligible for election to the Papacy.

1089
01:51:17,649 --> 01:51:20,849
He's not a Cardinal. He's a priest. He is of insufficient age.

1090
01:51:21,127 --> 01:51:24,535
Or maybe there is a way we could do to consider possibilities.

1091
01:51:24,640 --> 01:51:29,259
I’m sorry, protocols of Conclave are not subject to modification.

1092
01:51:29,515 --> 01:51:30,915
I will not call a ballot on this matter.

1093
01:51:31,316 --> 01:51:33,700
But Signore, you cannot call a ballot.

1094
01:51:33,953 --> 01:51:37,000
Surely you remember. You gave up your post as great elector.

1095
01:51:38,316 --> 01:51:43,226
They are singing in at St. Peter's Square. Now, what happened here tonight transcends our laws.

1096
01:51:43,342 --> 01:51:47,195
Does it? It is God's will that we give ourselves over to frenzy.

1097
01:51:47,625 --> 01:51:48,825
Discard the rules of the Church.

1098
01:51:48,869 --> 01:51:52,318
Perhaps we need not discard them.

1099
01:51:52,584 --> 01:51:56,999
Signori, I am thinking now of Romano Pontifici Eligendo numero 60...

1100
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:01,084
- Acclamation by Adoration.
- Exactly, Signore. Exactly.

1101
01:52:01,436 --> 01:52:04,396
If the Holy Spirit speaks through us...

1102
01:52:04,912 --> 01:52:09,276
and we call a man’s name out loud... that is election by adoration.

1103
01:52:09,991 --> 01:52:11,722
He's God's choice.

1104
01:52:12,221 --> 01:52:17,000
And the candidate need only be an ordained member of the clergy...

1105
01:52:17,050 --> 01:52:21,75 0
present in the Sistine Chapel
at the moment of his election.

1106
01:52:53,380 --> 01:52:55,810
- Signor Camerlengo.
- Yes.

1107
01:52:55,823 --> 01:52:59,000
The Cardinals asked you to join them in Conclave as soon as possible.

1108
01:52:59,750 --> 01:53:01,365
Me?

1109
01:53:01,394 --> 01:53:02,988
Yes Padre.

1110
01:53:25,374 --> 01:53:30,349
- What are you doing?
- Getting some journals. I want them back.

1111
01:53:53,045 --> 01:53:55,303
Richter said,

1112
01:53:56,324 --> 01:53:59,424
"His Holiness suffered from seizures. We're taking steps"

1113
01:54:01,431 --> 01:54:03,707
"for safety."

1114
01:54:06,904 --> 01:54:10,247
"Make sure he is watched." he said.

1115
01:54:10,868 --> 01:54:14,656
What if he were trying to give me this key?

1116
01:54:15,815 --> 01:54:17,707
That’s the Papal office.

1117
01:54:18,407 --> 01:54:22,207
If the Pope was worried about seizures, he must've had Richter install cameras without telling anyone.

1118
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:26,064
To keep an eye on him, for safety.

1119
01:54:27,339 --> 01:54:30,191
Maybe it's records.

1120
01:54:38,919 --> 01:54:40,953
I read the journals Patrick.

1121
01:54:41,612 --> 01:54:44,126
The scientist kept journals. So?

1122
01:54:45,112 --> 01:54:47,990
- You figure prominently in them.
- Really?

1123
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:52,084
Devolio wasn’t just a physicist. He was also Catholic priest...

1124
01:54:52,666 --> 01:54:56,566
He was deeply conflicted about implication of his work

1125
01:54:56,977 --> 01:54:59,041
and need of spiritual guidances...

1126
01:54:59,297 --> 01:55:01,065
Like Galileo.

1127
01:55:01,630 --> 01:55:06,432
About a month ago, he requested audience with the Pope and you know that.

1128
01:55:06,994 --> 01:55:09,611
Because you granted the audience. You were also present during it.

1129
01:55:09,915 --> 01:55:13,750
The God 'Particle'. It was to claim an act of creation. Blasphemy.

1130
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:15,174
The arrogance.

1131
01:55:15,184 --> 01:55:16,729
The Holy Father
didn’t see it like that.

1132
01:55:17,668 --> 01:55:19,251
He urged him to go public...

1133
01:55:19,761 --> 01:55:23,061
His Holiness thought that discovery could actually scientifically prove

1134
01:55:23,815 --> 01:55:25,396
the existence of a divine power.

1135
01:55:25,776 --> 01:55:28,476
And begin to bridge the gap between science and religion...

1136
01:55:28,652 --> 01:55:31,280
His work was not religious... It was sacrilegious.

1137
01:55:31,422 --> 01:55:36,492
But you, you saw the Pope's position as softening of Church law.

1138
01:55:36,940 --> 01:55:40,556
As an old man’s weakness. Your Father's weakness!

1139
01:55:41,324 --> 01:55:44,407
- You murdered the Vicar of Christ!
- He raised me to protect this Church.

1140
01:55:44,659 --> 01:55:45,859
Even from within.

1141
01:55:47,601 --> 01:55:51,967
Then you countered up an old enemy from the past. The Illuminati.

1142
01:55:52,527 --> 01:55:56,000
You found the ancient brands in the Papal vaults and put them to use.

1143
01:55:56,499 --> 01:55:57,899
To spread fear!

1144
01:55:57,969 --> 01:55:59,714
Cardinals are men of belief.

1145
01:56:00,405 --> 01:56:03,968
Right now they believe evil is uniting them.

1146
01:56:04,255 --> 01:56:06,917
The entire catholic world would be united by this attack.

1147
01:56:07,152 --> 01:56:08,723
There is no attack!

1148
01:56:09,602 --> 01:56:12,902
You're trying to convince the Cardinals they're in a war.

1149
01:56:13,164 --> 01:56:14,564
So they'll choose a warrior to lead them.

1150
01:56:14,706 --> 01:56:18,206
We are at war. We are weak when we should be strong.

1151
01:56:18,398 --> 01:56:21,626
If science is allowed to claim power of creation...

1152
01:56:21,810 --> 01:56:23,833
What is left for God?

1153
01:56:24,034 --> 01:56:26,862
- It didn't work Patrick.
- It isn't finished.

1154
01:56:27,637 --> 01:56:29,280
Oh, yes it's finished.

1155
01:56:31,614 --> 01:56:32,914
It's finished.

1156
01:56:33,927 --> 01:56:36,254
I have shown the journals to Father Simeon.

1157
01:56:37,021 --> 01:56:41,021
The moment doors to Conclave open he will tell Cardinals what you've done.

1158
01:56:42,340 --> 01:56:45,132
I was planning doing this alone.

1159
01:56:47,347 --> 01:56:49,168
Put it down.

1160
01:56:51,962 --> 01:56:53,862
Perhaps it’s better that you're here.

1161
01:56:54,138 --> 01:56:55,066
Put it down.

1162
01:56:57,550 --> 01:56:59,050
Put it away.

1163
01:57:11,173 --> 01:57:14,347
Help. He's the one. He's got a gun.

1164
01:57:17,696 --> 01:57:18,006
Illuminati!

1165
01:57:18,750 --> 01:57:19,990
You Bastard!

1166
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:24,500
Illuminati!

1167
01:57:25,922 --> 01:57:27,322
Padre!

1168
01:57:35,904 --> 01:57:39,004
- And get the helicopters for older Cardinals. Right.

1169
01:58:28,750 --> 01:58:31,500
I've been summoned by colleague of Cardinals.

1170
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:45,000
Gently. But within our walls.

1171
02:00:46,206 --> 02:00:49,726
Father into Thy hands l commit my spirit.

1172
02:01:37,955 --> 02:01:42,253
Church sources now confirmed that Camerlengo Father Patrick McKenna...

1173
02:01:42,737 --> 02:01:46,954
has died over internal injuries sustained in his heroic fall.

1174
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:50,999
The Catholic Church thanks Camerlengo for his selfless act and demands his immediate canonization.

1175
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:59,500
The Vatican has also confirmed the deaths of three Cardinals and the fire in the Santa Maria della Vittoria.

1176
02:01:59,501 --> 02:02:03,750
As we wait appearance of the new Holy Father Cardinal Baggia of Italy...

1177
02:02:03,751 --> 02:02:06,494
one of the 4 original Preferiti

1178
02:02:06,563 --> 02:02:09,963
who despite terrorist attempts and disruption seems to have been the selected.

1179
02:02:10,048 --> 02:02:13,778
In one of the swiftest and smoothest Conclaves in modern Church history.

1180
02:02:20,874 --> 02:02:23,334
Professor Langdon. Please.

1181
02:02:38,629 --> 02:02:42,271
A token thing from His Holiness...

1182
02:02:42,704 --> 02:02:46,338
and from his new Camerlengo.

1183
02:02:46,506 --> 02:02:49,175
We are grateful you saved his life.

1184
02:02:49,996 --> 02:02:54,796
It’s our understanding that you require this text to complete your scholary work.

1185
02:02:57,195 --> 02:02:59,195
We ask only that in your last grand testament...

1186
02:03:00,175 --> 02:03:01,954
you ensure

1187
02:03:02,195 --> 02:03:03,695
that it finds it's way home.

1188
02:03:06,818 --> 02:03:08,037
Of course.

1189
02:03:08,672 --> 02:03:12,990
And when you write about us... and you will write about us.

1190
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:17,217
May I ask one thing? Do so gently.

1191
02:03:19,446 --> 02:03:21,120
I'll try.

1192
02:03:21,220 --> 02:03:22,993
Religion is flawed...

1193
02:03:23,654 --> 02:03:26,954
but only because men is all flawed.

1194
02:03:27,407 --> 02:03:29,007
Including this one.

1195
02:03:43,439 --> 02:03:46,482
He chose the name Luke?

1196
02:03:48,204 --> 02:03:51,623
There’s been many Marks and Johns.

1197
02:03:52,458 --> 02:03:54,757
Never a Luke.

1198
02:03:54,832 --> 02:03:56,132
He said he was doctor.

1199
02:03:56,845 --> 02:04:00,667
It's quite a message. Science and faith. All in one.

1200
02:04:01,749 --> 02:04:04,880
The world is in need of both.

1201
02:04:05,074 --> 02:04:06,774
You'll counsel him wisely.

1202
02:04:07,897 --> 02:04:10,853
I'm an old man. I'll counsel him briefly.

1203
02:04:17,200 --> 02:04:18,200
Mr. Langdon.

1204
02:04:23,512 --> 02:04:28,001
Thanks be to God for sending someone to protect this Church.

1205
02:04:31,614 --> 02:04:35,287
I don’t believe he sent me Father.

1206
02:04:35,386 --> 02:04:37,186
Oh, my son.

1207
02:04:37,696 --> 02:04:38,696
Of course he did.


9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
