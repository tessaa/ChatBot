1
00:01:29,292 --> 00:01:31,083
Yeah.

2
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:33,750
Shit.

3
00:01:34,292 --> 00:01:36,917
Where is he?

4
00:01:38,417 --> 00:01:41,000
Gotta go.

5
00:02:13,917 --> 00:02:16,500
What's the latest?

6
00:02:17,042 --> 00:02:19,583
Nothing, they say the first
24 hours...

7
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:23,958
Did she understand?

8
00:02:24,167 --> 00:02:25,917
It's not their fight.

9
00:02:26,167 --> 00:02:28,000
Did she understand?

10
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,750
It's not their fight.

11
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,375
Where are Tess and Isabel?

12
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:57,208
It's not their fight.

13
00:02:58,667 --> 00:03:00,500
Any change?

14
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,542
He's in critical condition,
but he's still alive.

15
00:03:02,792 --> 00:03:04,625
- You know, if he doesn't...
- Is Stan there?

16
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:07,333
- Yeah, he's been there an hour.
- Stan'll us what's going on.

17
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:12,458
cardio infarction.

18
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,458
He's endured an incredible shock
to his system.

19
00:03:17,042 --> 00:03:19,542
- Can he recover?
- Yes.

20
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:22,542
Will he recover?

21
00:03:23,042 --> 00:03:25,667
It helps if they have
something to live for.

22
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:28,708
Family.

23
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:36,083
Friends then.

24
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,792
Maybe that'll be enough.

25
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,125
<i>Reuben, when it comes
to Willie Bank</i>

26
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,333
<i>you can't rely on contracts.</i>

27
00:03:46,417 --> 00:03:48,292
<i>My lawyers say...
the ironclad.</i>

28
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,292
Gimme some credit for
my business.

29
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,125
But you'll still think it's a good idea
neither does Rusty?

30
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,417
Well, I'm doing it.
It's done.

31
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:58,208
And you tell Rusty that
I won't have to pull jobs...

32
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,500
to keep my hotel
solvent.

33
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:01,542
Hey, Reuben...

34
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,542
You fellows are young.

35
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:06,333
You don't understand.

36
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,625
Did you know that
the Inuit people...

37
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,625
put their elders out
on a ice foe to die...

38
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:13,417
when they're too
old to hunt?

39
00:04:13,917 --> 00:04:14,667
- Thanks.
- That's just a myth.

40
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,750
Well that ain't
gonna happen to me.

41
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,750
I can still hunt.
This is it.

42
00:04:18,917 --> 00:04:20,833
It's my chance.

43
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,542
I used to mean something in this town.
I would walk into a restaurant...

44
00:04:24,042 --> 00:04:25,917
if it was full, they'd snap out
a new table for me...

45
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:26,875
like that.

46
00:04:27,042 --> 00:04:29,000
Listen Reuben, if you're worried
about your place in history...

47
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:30,958
then let us get a
street named after you...

48
00:04:31,167 --> 00:04:31,958
or a boulevard.

49
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,792
We can talk about that
when I'm dead.

50
00:04:34,292 --> 00:04:37,208
Danny, I appreciate you coming
this far to see me...

51
00:04:37,292 --> 00:04:39,833
but I gotta do this.

52
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:42,208
Reuben!

53
00:04:42,417 --> 00:04:44,958
- Partner!
- Reuben!

54
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,250
So good of you to come.

55
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,333
Of course. Of course. I get
more items for my punch list...

56
00:04:50,542 --> 00:04:52,333
I got so much energy, I can...

57
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,417
hardly sleep from the excitement.

58
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,375
Where are you at on
the visas for the chefs?

59
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:58,215
My man in Washington says...

60
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,458
they'll be stamped
by the time we open.

61
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:03,167
- No, no, no, not good enough.
- That's what I said.

62
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:08,583
That's good.

63
00:05:08,792 --> 00:05:09,625
And the chandeliers?

64
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,583
My ex-wife's new brother-in-law...

65
00:05:11,792 --> 00:05:13,708
You don't need the details.
It's done.

66
00:05:13,917 --> 00:05:15,708
Half priced.
They're already at the warehouse.

67
00:05:15,917 --> 00:05:18,542
And because I know it mattered to you...

68
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:22,583
I appeared before the
City Council.

69
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,875
The one-way street leading
away...

70
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,833
from the rear entrance, now...

71
00:05:27,042 --> 00:05:29,667
leads toward the rear entrance.

72
00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:31,958
All roads lead to the "Midas".

73
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:34,042
This is perfect.

74
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,000
Great views up here.

75
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,833
Where's the partner's desk gonna be?

76
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,875
No partner's desk.

77
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,125
- Two desks.
- No two desks, one desk.

78
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,208
One chairman's desk.

79
00:05:46,417 --> 00:05:48,958
One.

80
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,000
The arrangement is changing.

81
00:05:54,542 --> 00:05:56,375
Was changed.

82
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:59,083
As a matter of fact
there is no arrangement.

83
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:02,208
Everybody said that you would
try to screw me.

84
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:05,250
But you've done it to everyone
of your partners.

85
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,215
But I defended you.
I said:

86
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,625
No, me and Willie Bank
been around long enough...

87
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:12,625
that we both shook Sinatra's hand.

88
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:15,292
And there's a code amongst guys
that shook Sinatra's hand.

89
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,750
Screw Sinatra's hand.

90
00:06:17,917 --> 00:06:20,417
- Screw?
- You're deadweight.

91
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:24,458
Do you think I'm gonna carry you
and pay you at the same time?

92
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,875
Reuben...

93
00:06:26,042 --> 00:06:26,917
you're out.

94
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,583
Never.
This is my land.

95
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,917
Was. Was your land.

96
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,667
- You signed it over to the corporation.
- For 50% interest.

97
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,708
Which I'm gonna ask you
to sign over to me.

98
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,750
For a small cash payment.

99
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,125
- I'm not signing that.
- Yes.

100
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,917
Get outta here.
I'm not signing that.

101
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:52,250
What are you gonna do?
Throw me of the roof?

102
00:06:52,542 --> 00:06:54,750
No, I don't want to.

103
00:06:55,292 --> 00:06:57,750
This is wrong. This is all wrong.

104
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:05,875
You're leaving me with nothing.

105
00:07:06,417 --> 00:07:08,167
You know you're right.

106
00:07:08,417 --> 00:07:10,875
And it's rude.

107
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,250
Here.

108
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,333
It's the first badge.

109
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:20,042
Just got made.

110
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:28,208
You changed the name.

111
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,500
I like it better.

112
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:33,250
Don't you?

113
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,708
<i>Reuben...</i>

114
00:07:42,917 --> 00:07:45,333
<i>he always was too
trusted.</i>

115
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,417
<i>Is Saul.
Is.</i>

116
00:07:47,917 --> 00:07:50,542
<i>Of course.
Is.</i>

117
00:07:51,042 --> 00:07:53,542
<i>He tried talking him out
of it next time.</i>

118
00:07:54,042 --> 00:07:54,792
<i>Look,
Bank hurt Reuben...</i>

119
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:57,917
<i>I know how that makes
me feel.</i>

120
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:59,875
<i>- I know what that makes me wanna do.
- Well, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.</i>

121
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,625
<i>I'm gonna get close to Bank
and I don't care if it gets messy.</i>

122
00:08:02,667 --> 00:08:03,958
I'll drive you...

123
00:08:04,167 --> 00:08:05,000
and get him leaving his barber.

124
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:05,958
Good, then I'll inject him.

125
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:08,042
Yeah and I'll find a spot
to get rid of the body.

126
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,042
All valid ideas.

127
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,083
Great initiative.

128
00:08:11,292 --> 00:08:12,125
But...

129
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,083
But...

130
00:08:14,292 --> 00:08:16,167
Even though Bank stepped
over the line...

131
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:17,333
we have to do what's best
for Reuben.

132
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:19,208
Which means
we offer Bank...

133
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:21,208
a "Billy Martin".

134
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,250
Wait a minute? And then what, he goes
for it? And that's it, he gets off?

135
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:24,833
- That's the rule.
- No, that's the rules...

136
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,000
for someone who understands the rules.

137
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,292
which Bank don't,
because he already broke them.

138
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:31,083
So he don't get the chance.

139
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,375
For Reuben...

140
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:36,083
I think we give him a chance.

141
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:40,458
I need answers before
I ask questions.

142
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:42,542
You get that?

143
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:45,250
Alright. Do it!

144
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,000
So...

145
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:49,375
some guys I take
seriously...

146
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,375
tell me you're a serious guy.

147
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,667
Right.

148
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,750
What I want...

149
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:59,500
what's most important to be is that Reuben
gets his share of the hotel restored.

150
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:02,792
I'm here to give you a chance
to do that.

151
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,500
You're gonna give me a chance?

152
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:09,542
Okay.

153
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,917
It's a Billy Martin?

154
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:13,958
I pass.

155
00:09:14,167 --> 00:09:16,625
Last time I looked
and I look every morning...

156
00:09:17,167 --> 00:09:19,667
it was my name listed as owner
on more valuable property...

157
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:22,792
in this state than anyone else
in history.

158
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:25,083
Which means you gotta
lot more to lose.

159
00:09:25,292 --> 00:09:27,083
Well I don't lose.

160
00:09:27,292 --> 00:09:29,167
People who bet on me
to lose, lose...

161
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,125
and they lose big.

162
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,208
You come at me
you better know...

163
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,250
I move quick
and when I do...

164
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:36,292
I slice...

165
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,292
like a goddamn hammer.

166
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,333
So you're not gonna make Rueben?

167
00:09:40,542 --> 00:09:42,333
If Reuben was too weak
or too stupid...

168
00:09:42,542 --> 00:09:44,417
to see what was coming down...

169
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,375
then you know what?

170
00:09:45,542 --> 00:09:47,458
He didn't belong here.

171
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,417
He's made the right choice:

172
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,500
roll over and die.

173
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:54,167
Let him be.

174
00:09:58,792 --> 00:10:01,250
How long do I have to
wait for a conduit?

175
00:10:01,792 --> 00:10:04,292
I don't want the labor pains
I just want the baby.

176
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:07,333
Six months later.

177
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,125
Well...

178
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,083
thanks for coming.

179
00:10:41,292 --> 00:10:43,167
Thanks for the 100 Grant.

180
00:10:43,417 --> 00:10:45,167
This takes longer than
a day though.

181
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,250
Gonna have to re-negotiate.

182
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,208
That's fair.

183
00:10:49,417 --> 00:10:51,958
I'd like some Sen Cha
or Genmaicha.

184
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,333
Green tea.
Yes, sir.

185
00:10:54,542 --> 00:10:56,292
And don't burn it.

186
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,375
Pour it just before boiling point...

187
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,167
- not after.
- Green Tea. Si signore.

188
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:04,167
Graci.

189
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:06,458
Just us three?

190
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:09,292
- For now...
- Figured we talk to you first..

191
00:11:09,667 --> 00:11:10,542
Good lord.

192
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,625
How stuck I am?

193
00:11:12,792 --> 00:11:13,542
Stuck.

194
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,583
Stalled really.

195
00:11:14,792 --> 00:11:16,667
Stuck.

196
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,667
Run it from me.

197
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,625
Don't leave anything out.

198
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,708
Give me the big picture.

199
00:11:22,917 --> 00:11:24,708
- You wanna?
- It's all yours.

200
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:27,500
- Where shall we start?
- Start with the hotel.

201
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,917
<i>Bank really put
on this one.</i>

202
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:42,000
<i>Forget weekenders
and conventioneers.</i>

203
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:44,750
<i>He's built this place for the whales.</i>

204
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,042
<i>of a Five Diamond Award.</i>

205
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,125
<i>The marble was handpicked in Italy...</i>

206
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,250
<i>and the chefs stolen from the highest
rated restaurants on the Michelin guidebook.</i>

207
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:54,125
<i>In the villas
big players</i>

208
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:56,958
<i>the silverware is
actually gold.</i>

209
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:00,250
<i>Bank's greatest strength
is also his weakness.</i>

210
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:02,250
<i>Ego.</i>

211
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,917
<i>He's been spending his days checking
and rechecking every inch of the property...</i>

212
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,292
<i>getting ready for the grand
opening celebration.</i>

213
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,125
<i>It's a compulsion.</i>

214
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,375
<i>Bank's right-hand man
is a woman.</i>

215
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:14,417
<i>Abigail Sponder.</i>

216
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:15,458
We're gonna have to let you go.

217
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,458
Turn in your uniform.

218
00:12:17,667 --> 00:12:19,458
I only gained 4 pounds.
You can't.

219
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,500
Yeah, well your body mass index
is not what its supposed to be.

220
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,208
- But miss Sponder...
- Oh no, babydoll,

221
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,250
it's your butt that's the problem.

222
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:31,333
You can't find a waitress
based on appearance, man.

223
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,000
That's just unconstitutional.

224
00:12:33,042 --> 00:12:34,708
If they were waitresses.

225
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:36,792
Yeah, they're actually hired
as models who serve.

226
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:38,750
So that Bank can monitor their
physical appearance.

227
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,042
It's a cruel practice.

228
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,458
So between Bank and Sponder
they got the place covered.

229
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,917
- When is opening night?
- July the 3rd.

230
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,583
Got fireworks the stroke of midnight
the whole charade.

231
00:12:49,042 --> 00:12:51,625
Are we going in now?
It's already open.

232
00:12:52,167 --> 00:12:52,917
No, it's a soft opening.

233
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,000
To test the place
before the grand opening.

234
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:55,958
Yeah it's kinda like an
out of town preview...

235
00:12:56,167 --> 00:12:58,042
on the town.

236
00:12:58,208 --> 00:12:59,083
Soft opening? Grand opening?

237
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,042
When they opened the Flamingo...

238
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,125
one day it was closed
the next day it was open.

239
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,125
End of story.

240
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,167
I know, I was there.

241
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:07,417
Well it's different now.

242
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:09,375
So when is opening night?

243
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:11,500
July the 3rd.

244
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,167
Now the top casinos can clear
$3 million a day...

245
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:15,458
just on the floor.

246
00:13:15,667 --> 00:13:17,542
Bank with his high level players...

247
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,542
and no limits is projecting 5.

248
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,625
Upon exchange for the loans
he had to give up...

249
00:13:21,792 --> 00:13:23,583
six of the nine seats
on the board.

250
00:13:23,792 --> 00:13:26,292
So he doesn't control his company.
The guys he brought in aren't friendly.

251
00:13:26,792 --> 00:13:30,333
So he has to clear 500 million
in the first quarter...

252
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:32,750
or he gets dumped out of
his own hotel.

253
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:36,458
Bank wants another
Five Diamond Award.

254
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:38,792
Every hotel I ever...

255
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,500
has one: a Royal Review
Five Diamond Award.

256
00:13:42,042 --> 00:13:43,917
The Cigarou Inn:
five diamonds.

257
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,583
The Peloponnesian Monte Carlo:
five diamonds.

258
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:50,667
<i>The Grand Saphir, Singapore:
cinco diamantes.</i>

259
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:52,625
Atomano Crest, Tahiti...

260
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,125
I never not won one.

261
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:00,042
So, how are you gonna get the diamonds?

262
00:14:00,292 --> 00:14:02,042
- We're not.
- We thought about it for a minute...

263
00:14:02,292 --> 00:14:04,125
- Then we decided... It was...
- Impossible.

264
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:08,833
- Tell him about Debbie.
- Yeah, tell him about Debbie.

265
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:11,208
<i>Debbie is a concierge at the Bank.</i>

266
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,208
<i>She's very ambitious.</i>

267
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:15,250
<i>In a good way...</i>

268
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,208
<i>for us.</i>

269
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:19,042
<i>As soon as I said the words:
general manager...</i>

270
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:20,292
<i>she was in.</i>

271
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:23,083
<i>I put a cherry on top
to make sure.</i>

272
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,375
<i>We found out who'd be
reviewing the hotel.</i>

273
00:14:27,542 --> 00:14:29,458
<i>We're gonna get to him
before Bank can.</i>

274
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:32,167
I feel bad.
Like torture.

275
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:35,167
This is war, kid.
There's gonna be collateral damage.

276
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,583
lar restul se va întâmpla
at the airport.

277
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:41,583
- No, he doesn't know that.
- So what?

278
00:14:41,792 --> 00:14:44,375
He has to know why you won?
You enjoy it? Who says?

279
00:14:44,792 --> 00:14:47,417
Alright so you go through that
for 10 million?

280
00:14:47,917 --> 00:14:50,458
No. I do it for eleven mille.

281
00:14:58,042 --> 00:15:00,958
Now, we found out
Bank is tapped into

282
00:15:01,042 --> 00:15:02,833
the federal fingerprint
database.

283
00:15:03,042 --> 00:15:04,917
Highly illegal.

284
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:06,875
We came up with a way
to piggyback his system...

285
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:09,125
in between
firewall checks.

286
00:15:09,167 --> 00:15:10,125
Very interesting stuff out there.

287
00:15:10,167 --> 00:15:12,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, what else?

288
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:13,958
We're gonna get his whales.

289
00:15:14,167 --> 00:15:15,000
How?

290
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,417
He talked to Denny Shields.

291
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,583
Denny Shields?

292
00:15:19,917 --> 00:15:23,583
After he bragged about you guys
into talking about how?

293
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:24,833
We need him.

294
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,583
I should have kept my mouth shut.

295
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,375
And then I saw that guy walking around.

296
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:31,208
I didn't know who he was.
And I... Just some guy to me.

297
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,750
- And I guess I pissed him off.
- Denny, look...

298
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,583
you know what you gotta know who he was.

299
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,708
Just forget it. Let it go.

300
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,542
The other stuff I got taken
care of...

301
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:41,125
is all straight.

302
00:15:41,167 --> 00:15:42,667
I got 18 whales,

303
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,583
I spoke to their handlers,
I spoke to their managers,

304
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:46,833
I spoke to their assistants.

305
00:15:46,917 --> 00:15:48,667
Everyone of them is gonna.

306
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,333
We're gonna do it in two.

307
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,750
I'm gonna leave first
they're gonna follow.

308
00:15:52,792 --> 00:15:54,167
- Okay.
- Okay.

309
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:57,458
But you gotta make sure they win
because these guys usually lose.

310
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,708
- And when they lose, they get.
- They're gonna win big.

311
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,125
- How big?
- 500.

312
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:04,375
- One million.
- That night just a group of you

313
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:06,792
No, it's a reverse
Big Store.

314
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:08,167
Right...

315
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,958
- Doesn't matter if we win...
- As long as the casino loses, yes...

316
00:16:11,542 --> 00:16:14,083
That could actually work.
So you need to rig...

317
00:16:14,118 --> 00:16:16,542
Craps, Black Jack,
roulette, slots.

318
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:21,000
This polymer reacts to
ultrasonic pulses...

319
00:16:21,042 --> 00:16:24,167
but it's not metallic, so the compasses
on the table won't detect it...

320
00:16:24,792 --> 00:16:26,750
and it don't effect the way
mark the dice.

321
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:28,833
Now this...

322
00:16:29,167 --> 00:16:30,333
Not really a lighter?

323
00:16:33,042 --> 00:16:36,250
<i>The dice are controlled from the
manufacturer all the way to the floor.</i>

324
00:16:36,292 --> 00:16:38,750
<i>Which is why we went
all the way to the manufacturer.</i>

325
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:01,000
Could the air conditioner
be switched on?

326
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:04,000
The air conditioner? You're crazy.

327
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:08,083
Look...

328
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,083
You know?
It's dangerous.

329
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:23,083
Dangerous, is my middle name.

330
00:17:26,417 --> 00:17:27,833
That's not your problem.

331
00:17:28,292 --> 00:17:30,250
So you're jammed on
Black Jack.

332
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:32,333
We've embedded Livingston in
the Shuffle Company.

333
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:36,000
Now the tap will stimulate your EKG
much in the same way a lie would.

334
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:38,083
But you have to step on it
during the control questions.

335
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,667
Your name, birth date, so on.

336
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:43,208
So those levels will match the stress level
with your false answers.

337
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,250
I got it.

338
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:46,167
How much is this gonna hurt?

339
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:48,750
If you're doing it right,
it should be pretty excruciating.

340
00:17:48,792 --> 00:17:52,250
<i>Is your birth date February 11, 1965?</i>

341
00:17:52,292 --> 00:17:53,500
<i>Yes.</i>

342
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,333
<i>Are you wearing a white shirt?</i>

343
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,583
<i>Yes.</i>

344
00:17:57,917 --> 00:18:01,333
<i>Have you ever been involved in
the commission of a crime?</i>

345
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:02,667
<i>Oh, no.</i>

346
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:06,750
<i>Have you ever defrauded or attempted
to defraud the gaming industry?</i>

347
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:08,625
<i>No.</i>

348
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,750
- Alex...
- Solid.

349
00:18:12,167 --> 00:18:13,708
I love technology.

350
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:17,125
- I guess to look at you I'd swear
you would be evasive... - But?

351
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,417
the machine says you're clean.

352
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,417
I'm just a little nervous.

353
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,375
I really want this job.

354
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:27,542
<i>You can relax now.
Welcome to Shuffle Royal.</i>

355
00:18:28,042 --> 00:18:29,792
The Shuffle Royal.

356
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,875
I doubt I've heard
the last of that one.

357
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:35,875
So if Black Jack is
not your problem...

358
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:37,625
it must be slots.

359
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,458
Progressors run of computer
chips now.

360
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:44,292
You're gonna have to program in a trapdoor.

361
00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:47,500
I can probably find you
someone to do that.

362
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:50,042
Thanks Roman, we got somebody in
on the inside.

363
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:51,958
A great kid
named Eugene.

364
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,750
<i>Who's got a little
too much downtime.</i>

365
00:18:53,792 --> 00:18:56,542
He's run up a nice little online gaming tap.

366
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,500
<i>He won't be able to keep
it a secret much longer.</i>

367
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:02,542
Now I have no...
Uh yeah, it's crazed.

368
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:03,583
How bad is it?

369
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:07,458
Uh, it's bad...
I owe $30,000.

370
00:19:08,417 --> 00:19:11,125
<i>- So it may as well be a 100.
- Alright.</i>

371
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,292
Let's call it a 100.

372
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,333
Thanks Danny.

373
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,917
Eugene. My pleasure.

374
00:19:19,667 --> 00:19:22,042
Now tell me how you're
gonna program that trapdoor.

375
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:25,042
<i>So if that's not the problem,
it must be roulette.</i>

376
00:19:25,417 --> 00:19:28,042
<i>Having it in that game is in for a scanner
on the shoe...</i>

377
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,708
<i>wired to a microcomputer
somewhere on your person.</i>

378
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:34,667
<i>It figures the probability where
the wheels will end within 3 digits.</i>

379
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,625
<i>Yeah, we-we tried that.</i>

380
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,792
<i>No offense, the way he
was dressed, didn't help.</i>

381
00:19:43,827 --> 00:19:45,417
<i>Not very subtle, this guy.</i>

382
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,542
<i>- So you're stuck on roulette?
- No.</i>

383
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:52,958
<i>We're going lo-fi we think we can
get some loaded balls in there.</i>

384
00:19:52,993 --> 00:19:54,917
Kidding?
How are you gonna deliver?

385
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:56,507
Two stages.

386
00:19:56,542 --> 00:19:58,542
First we position a man of our own.

387
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,917
There's a gaming Expo the day
of the grand opening...

388
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,500
which Bank is committed to attend.

389
00:20:02,917 --> 00:20:05,042
To show what a regular
guy he is.

390
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:07,083
Frank's suiting up as The Game.

391
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:10,000
The men who make the decisions
are very hard to impress.

392
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:13,000
That's why I'm asking each and
every one of you to help me so...

393
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:17,083
by being the most classy, gentile...

394
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,667
ladies.

395
00:20:19,042 --> 00:20:21,125
The image that we're looking for...

396
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,542
are tasteful elegance.

397
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:27,667
What exactly do you want us to do?

398
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,167
Raise your skirts up about 3 inches.

399
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,167
Second part.
We tie Frank to one of theirs.

400
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,708
A pit boss with sticky fingers.

401
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,292
How much for these?

402
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:48,292
Is Willie Bank know
you're stealing his gold flatware, Neil?

403
00:20:49,417 --> 00:20:50,667
How do you know my name?

404
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,667
Well we know a lotta names.

405
00:20:54,542 --> 00:20:56,125
Your wife, Mary...

406
00:20:56,792 --> 00:20:59,333
your kids, Leanne and Dolly.

407
00:21:00,167 --> 00:21:02,458
We know that you are
the pit boss at the casino.

408
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,708
You don't wanna...

409
00:21:03,792 --> 00:21:05,292
- I mean, I don't...
- We don't wanna hurt you.

410
00:21:05,327 --> 00:21:06,465
We wanna help you.

411
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,042
We wanna double your salary.
All in one night.

412
00:21:11,667 --> 00:21:12,958
What do you need me to do?

413
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,542
Right now, nothing. Go home,
do your job.

414
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:18,000
And at the appropriate moment
somebody'll present himself to you.

415
00:21:18,042 --> 00:21:20,625
- Enough said?
- Enough said.

416
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:24,167
Who is the shill at the Expo
to rope Bank?

417
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,833
- We're still looking.
- We'll find someone.

418
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:29,042
Make sure it's somebody
he really despises.

419
00:21:29,792 --> 00:21:31,042
Back to macro.

420
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:34,042
What is your exit strategy?

421
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:38,042
The players won't be on the scam...

422
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:41,000
so they'll all think
it's their lucky night.

423
00:21:41,042 --> 00:21:43,125
But you never get them out of
the door with all their winnings...

424
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:44,833
they'll dump it all back.

425
00:21:44,917 --> 00:21:47,187
That's Vegas
and that's your problem.

426
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:49,458
Well the exit strategy is A problem...

427
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:51,625
it's not THE problem.

428
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:54,208
The problem is security.
We're drawing a blank.

429
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,833
It's a little spooky.

430
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:57,625
The specs aren't on the grey market,
the black market...

431
00:21:57,667 --> 00:21:59,583
or any other market.

432
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:02,292
And all I keep hearing, is there's
never been a system like this.

433
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:05,458
Now I've found out where they designed it,
but I can't even get in the building.

434
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,792
I've blown all my buy money,
my bribe money...

435
00:22:06,917 --> 00:22:10,208
4 of my best ideas and
I am nowhere.

436
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:13,250
But not only I'm nowhere,
I'm pretty sure I'm being followed.

437
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:14,708
<i>Do you have anything?</i>

438
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,667
Yeah, I think I have a name,
but I don't even know if it's right.

439
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:19,625
- They're calling it...
- The Greco.

440
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:21,458
The Greco Player Tracker.

441
00:22:23,167 --> 00:22:24,750
They've put it in Vegas.

442
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:29,500
- Well I give you back the 100 Grant.
- Why?

443
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:32,542
Danny,

444
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:34,208
I like you.

445
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:37,583
And you, Rusty.
I mean you got style.

446
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:40,708
You're brilliant, got loyalty.

447
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:44,250
You 2 were remarkable minds of
a thievery but even they went

448
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:45,417
off to borrow.

449
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,833
You're analogue players
in a digital world.

450
00:22:50,292 --> 00:22:51,625
You're done.

451
00:22:53,542 --> 00:22:56,750
Believe me, I would love to
go up against Greco...

452
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,417
and crush him.

453
00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:01,458
But it can't be beaten.

454
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:04,458
It can't be hacked...

455
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:05,792
and it can't be beaten.

456
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:06,958
Not even by you?

457
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,000
Oh with 18 months...

458
00:23:09,042 --> 00:23:12,583
nothing else on my plate
no other jobs, no women or distractions...

459
00:23:13,292 --> 00:23:14,500
maybe.

460
00:23:14,542 --> 00:23:18,000
- You know everything about this thing.
- Everything.

461
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,125
Except where it was being
deployed.

462
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:23,042
The inventor is an old schoolmate of mine.

463
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:25,875
His name is Greco Montgomery

464
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,542
The pompous ass named
it after himself.

465
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:30,833
Greco?

466
00:23:31,792 --> 00:23:32,708
Roman?

467
00:23:32,917 --> 00:23:35,917
Yeah, you've obviously never served
time in a British boarding school.

468
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,833
So what's so tough about this thing?

469
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:41,875
It's an artificial intelligence
security system.

470
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:44,708
He must be field-testing.

471
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:46,667
You mean it has a brain?

472
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:48,958
A hell of a brain.

473
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,333
It doesn't only think...

474
00:23:52,917 --> 00:23:53,917
it reasons.

475
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:57,833
<i>It reads every permutation in every weight
in every seat in the entire casino.</i>

476
00:23:57,875 --> 00:23:59,465
<i>Hand by hand.</i>

477
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,542
That's why this
security cameras

478
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:03,583
that measure pupil dilation.

479
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:06,958
And determine if a win
is legitimate or expected.

480
00:24:07,042 --> 00:24:08,542
It gathers biofeedback...

481
00:24:08,583 --> 00:24:11,250
player's heart-rates,
body temperatures...

482
00:24:11,292 --> 00:24:13,917
it measures on a second by
second basis...

483
00:24:14,042 --> 00:24:16,625
whether the standard variations
of gaming algorithm...

484
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,750
are holding...

485
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:20,250
or are being manipulated.

486
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,792
The data is analyzed in real-time...

487
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:23,917
in a field of exabytes.

488
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:26,417
Exabytes?

489
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,833
- You know what a terabyte is?
- Yeah. It's a...

490
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:31,208
- An exabyte is a million terabytes.
- Right.

491
00:24:32,167 --> 00:24:35,500
MacGreco is housed
in an impregnable room.

492
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:37,215
Shock mounted...

493
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:42,042
temperature controlled and it locks down
if it even sensors it is under attack.

494
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:45,750
If it locks down, there wouldn't
even be able to get out of the room.

495
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,958
Couldn't we just shut it off?
You know, cut the wires?

496
00:24:50,083 --> 00:24:52,250
That could work.

497
00:24:52,292 --> 00:24:54,292
Better still you'd just kick
the plug out of the socket.

498
00:24:54,333 --> 00:24:56,333
- Seriously.
- No, short of walking into that room...

499
00:24:56,375 --> 00:24:58,125
with a bloody magnetron around your neck.

500
00:24:58,167 --> 00:24:59,792
You know what a magnetron is?

501
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,125
Something that screws up the Greco.

502
00:25:03,417 --> 00:25:04,458
Aha...

503
00:25:04,917 --> 00:25:06,250
short of that.

504
00:25:08,417 --> 00:25:11,042
I'm kinda shocked this is
where we are, because...

505
00:25:11,333 --> 00:25:12,917
- This is a problem.
- That's what I said.

506
00:25:12,958 --> 00:25:14,625
But if we could somehow...

507
00:25:14,667 --> 00:25:17,583
No there is no if...
It can not be shut off.

508
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:20,708
I mean you'd need a real natural
disaster an actual act of God.

509
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,375
- But if we could...
- You can't.

510
00:25:22,417 --> 00:25:23,958
- But if we did?
- You can't.

511
00:25:24,292 --> 00:25:25,542
You could.

512
00:25:26,375 --> 00:25:27,500
Don't flatter.

513
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:30,875
If we could, how long
would it take to reboot?

514
00:25:31,625 --> 00:25:34,750
Because it's so sophisticated
3,5 minutes.

515
00:25:35,875 --> 00:25:37,000
Would be enough.

516
00:25:37,125 --> 00:25:38,708
Pick a natural disaster.

517
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:44,000
Get me a laptop.

518
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:48,125
Now the drill access is through
a sewer main of Paris Drive.

519
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:51,708
Grind along here into the
northwest corner of the hotel.

520
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:52,667
Here.

521
00:25:52,958 --> 00:25:54,792
Probably about 6,00 Rpm

522
00:25:54,833 --> 00:25:56,292
so you won't wake all the neighbors.

523
00:25:57,208 --> 00:25:59,417
When it reaches the resident's frequency...

524
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,833
the building acts like a tuning fork.

525
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:05,875
To the people inside it will
feel like an earthquake.

526
00:26:07,125 --> 00:26:09,625
<i>That should knock out
the Greco.</i>

527
00:26:10,167 --> 00:26:13,042
<i>And that's your exit strategy.</i>

528
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,667
- Hey Bash?
- I'm up here.

529
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,958
- Hey!
- Here you go.

530
00:26:53,417 --> 00:26:54,792
Hey, where the mags?

531
00:26:56,583 --> 00:26:58,917
- Linus...
- I can't find those things.

532
00:26:58,952 --> 00:27:01,125
I need them.
I can't leave.

533
00:27:01,167 --> 00:27:02,500
- Why are you such a...
- I'm sorry...

534
00:27:02,542 --> 00:27:03,833
ask somebody else.

535
00:27:03,875 --> 00:27:06,667
- Ask Livingston.
- You're such a wowser.

536
00:27:10,667 --> 00:27:12,333
Look, read this to Reuben.

537
00:27:16,792 --> 00:27:19,625
I've done research. Positive
messages get through.

538
00:27:20,458 --> 00:27:21,840
I can't say this.

539
00:27:21,875 --> 00:27:24,250
No, no I'm saying it.
You're just a vessel.

540
00:27:24,333 --> 00:27:26,917
Come on Basher, look,
why don't you take a break?

541
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,292
I'll watch all the equipment.
You'll go read it to him.

542
00:27:30,333 --> 00:27:31,708
Shit.

543
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:33,125
You know we never digging
the tunnel...

544
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:35,875
they had teams of guys
monitoring this.

545
00:27:36,375 --> 00:27:38,042
Yeah?
How many?

546
00:27:40,167 --> 00:27:41,208
Teams.

547
00:27:46,208 --> 00:27:47,792
That's a 5.6.

548
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:49,923
If you don't think a 5.6
is possible or even likely.

549
00:27:49,958 --> 00:27:54,042
Then quit frankly you don't know
much about Byllups senior report...

550
00:27:54,125 --> 00:27:56,833
specifically the Saxon
and the Mohabi block.

551
00:27:58,417 --> 00:28:01,333
I know what you're hoping
then it'll be just a blind trust...

552
00:28:02,083 --> 00:28:04,250
<i>See that, that's Rusty.</i>

553
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:07,583
He's doing an Irwin Allen.
See that?

554
00:28:08,917 --> 00:28:10,708
He's not deaf, Linus.

555
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,833
<i>- Why am I here?
- Close your hotel.</i>

556
00:28:13,917 --> 00:28:14,958
<i>Permanently.</i>

557
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,625
<i>What?</i>

558
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,250
We haven't even opened yet.

559
00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:21,208
- What are all those people downstairs?
- Well, it's a soft open.

560
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:22,750
It's like an out of town preview...

561
00:28:22,833 --> 00:28:25,000
What do you think? You just come in
here to tell me to close my hotel.

562
00:28:25,042 --> 00:28:26,292
I'm not gonna close my hotel.

563
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:28,958
Sir, if you just let me come in with
my team and our gear here for a few days.

564
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,208
- No.
- I can proof what I'm saying.

565
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:35,125
No hey, there is no way we are exposing
our exclusive clientele to a bunch of...

566
00:28:35,167 --> 00:28:36,042
Scientists?

567
00:28:36,708 --> 00:28:38,083
We wouldn't want that, would we?

568
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:41,375
Let's just hope for the best, shall we.
That should be enough.

569
00:28:45,042 --> 00:28:46,333
Take this.

570
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:48,333
It's a standard torsion seismograph.

571
00:28:48,458 --> 00:28:50,917
If there is a foreshock
it will register...

572
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,458
and you just might have
time te evacuate.

573
00:28:53,542 --> 00:28:55,542
I don't want this thing on my desk.

574
00:28:55,625 --> 00:28:58,000
No sir, let me tell you what you don't want.

575
00:28:58,083 --> 00:29:00,417
Your hotel on the cover of Time magazine...

576
00:29:00,542 --> 00:29:02,465
in a twisted heap of steel and glass.

577
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,500
You and your customers are
underneath it. Headline reads:

578
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:06,625
Who's to blame?

579
00:29:07,542 --> 00:29:09,000
That's what you don't want.

580
00:29:09,083 --> 00:29:10,500
Okay...

581
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:15,083
Put an evacuation plan on paper.

582
00:29:15,125 --> 00:29:17,417
Will do, sir.
Consider it done.

583
00:29:17,958 --> 00:29:19,542
I do thank you for your time.

584
00:29:20,875 --> 00:29:24,208
If you really wanna put yourself to
good use... Why don't you hit the tables?

585
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,840
I don't gamble, sir...

586
00:29:25,875 --> 00:29:27,792
neither should you
not with people's lives.

587
00:29:28,375 --> 00:29:32,542
I'll screen the meetings more careful
the next time. I'm sorry, Mr. Bank.

588
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:39,417
<i>And now we have a camera
in Bank's office.</i>

589
00:29:46,292 --> 00:29:47,667
I see you, Reuben.

590
00:29:59,292 --> 00:30:00,833
A letter from Basher.

591
00:30:04,667 --> 00:30:05,708
Dear Reuben...

592
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:10,083
as the band said: two hearts
beat as one.

593
00:30:10,292 --> 00:30:12,167
When men have been
in battle together...

594
00:30:12,375 --> 00:30:15,917
they are bonded like the flower
and the soil and the sun...

595
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:20,208
and like the moon catches the light...
Reuben, I'll go ahead and leave this...

596
00:30:21,542 --> 00:30:22,833
here.

597
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,542
I see you, pall.

598
00:30:38,083 --> 00:30:40,167
So she says:
What did I do? What did I do?

599
00:30:40,583 --> 00:30:42,417
I said:
What do I look like, a pancake eater?

600
00:30:44,458 --> 00:30:46,375
- So you just left her down on the floor?
- Right on the floor.

601
00:30:47,167 --> 00:30:48,792
- For how long?
- The next morning.

602
00:30:49,667 --> 00:30:50,750
Good.

603
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,583
Yeah.

604
00:30:57,417 --> 00:30:59,625
Thanks Debbie.
Pack your swimsuit.

605
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:41,000
I don't wanna see any slack
faces in front of the house.

606
00:32:41,035 --> 00:32:44,667
- Only happy faces, no slack faces.
- Right.

607
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:46,132
Go!

608
00:32:46,167 --> 00:32:47,792
- Go! Go!
- Right.

609
00:32:54,958 --> 00:32:56,125
I'm sorry.

610
00:32:57,667 --> 00:32:58,792
Sorry.

611
00:33:07,375 --> 00:33:10,458
Mr. Shields, where are you going?
We got you proof grand opening.

612
00:33:10,493 --> 00:33:13,208
A friend of mine, a very serious man...

613
00:33:13,417 --> 00:33:15,507
told me very seriously...

614
00:33:15,542 --> 00:33:17,500
that'll be a good idea
if I left the hotel.

615
00:33:17,535 --> 00:33:19,500
I'm taking his suggestion.

616
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,750
He can't be too serious...

617
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:23,958
if he knew what I got in store for you now.

618
00:33:23,993 --> 00:33:25,923
Willie, I'm outta here.
Thank you.

619
00:33:25,958 --> 00:33:28,917
- See you Willie.
- I really hate to see you go, man.

620
00:33:28,952 --> 00:33:29,917
Let's go.

621
00:33:34,125 --> 00:33:35,167
Bank here.

622
00:33:36,917 --> 00:33:37,750
Confirmed?

623
00:33:39,042 --> 00:33:39,917
Bine.

624
00:33:42,375 --> 00:33:45,208
- Where?
- The gentleman in the Trilby, sir.

625
00:33:46,042 --> 00:33:46,917
The what?

626
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:50,333
The Doctor Dolittle hat.

627
00:33:51,083 --> 00:33:52,833
Why don't you just say that?

628
00:33:54,125 --> 00:33:55,125
Okay.

629
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:11,583
- Excuse me... Mr.?
- Chubb.

630
00:34:11,958 --> 00:34:13,208
Kensington Chubb.

631
00:34:13,458 --> 00:34:14,632
How do you do, Mr. Chubb?

632
00:34:14,667 --> 00:34:17,583
Would you like to follow me, I think
I might be able to move things along.

633
00:34:17,618 --> 00:34:19,205
How very nice of you.

634
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,792
No, no, no, no, no!

635
00:34:20,833 --> 00:34:23,840
Her Highness is a very
delicate animal.

636
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:27,625
It upsets her so everyone
but papa carries her about.

637
00:34:28,375 --> 00:34:29,708
All's well, dear.

638
00:34:30,125 --> 00:34:31,583
- Why don't you just follow me?
- How very considerate.

639
00:34:33,583 --> 00:34:36,708
<i>I do appreciate what
you’re doing for me.</i>

640
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:37,750
Oh, sorry.

641
00:34:37,833 --> 00:34:39,708
- Why does he get to go...
- He's a V.I.P.

642
00:34:40,375 --> 00:34:43,167
So what's that make me?
A V.U.P.?

643
00:34:43,202 --> 00:34:44,958
A Very Unimportant Person?

644
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,375
I have a reservation.

645
00:34:55,625 --> 00:34:57,792
De ce nu iei o pauzã?
Mã ocup eu de oaspete.

646
00:34:58,792 --> 00:35:01,125
Hello sir, I'm sorry for the wait.
Welcome to the Bank.

647
00:35:17,333 --> 00:35:20,340
Hello.
Kensington Chubb here.

648
00:35:20,375 --> 00:35:23,875
Saul, it's me.
He's in his room. Blast him.

649
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:25,250
Got it.

650
00:35:25,542 --> 00:35:27,833
Gloves and mask
don't take any chances.

651
00:35:27,868 --> 00:35:28,875
Got it.

652
00:36:11,375 --> 00:36:12,750
Hello, front desk.

653
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,882
Yeah, I'm in room 1706...

654
00:36:15,917 --> 00:36:18,875
and there's some sort of
terrible smell in here.

655
00:36:20,083 --> 00:36:21,625
It smells like...

656
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,917
Well but... I need, I need to move!

657
00:36:24,375 --> 00:36:27,167
Certainly, sir.
I'll just see if we have anything available.

658
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:33,333
I'm sorry, sir. We are fully booked
for the grand opening gala...

659
00:36:33,375 --> 00:36:35,375
but I'll let you know if anything ends up.

660
00:36:35,542 --> 00:36:37,333
Enjoy your stay at the Bank.

661
00:36:37,368 --> 00:36:38,375
- But...
- Goodbye.

662
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:52,625
- That I'm ready to see all available rooms.
- My way, mister. - Thank you.

663
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,375
Her highness is so very
sensitive to smells.

664
00:37:00,042 --> 00:37:01,083
Get away.

665
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:02,917
If you keep on complaining...

666
00:37:02,958 --> 00:37:04,875
they'll fire us, just for listening...

667
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,042
I just say that the working
conditions are bad.

668
00:37:11,083 --> 00:37:13,083
Nobody can deny that.

669
00:37:15,625 --> 00:37:18,667
Payment... little.

670
00:37:18,708 --> 00:37:20,208
Working hours... long.

671
00:37:20,292 --> 00:37:23,417
That's the way it is in Mexico.

672
00:37:25,375 --> 00:37:28,333
Did you all forget about...

673
00:37:28,417 --> 00:37:30,375
general Emiliano Zapata?

674
00:37:31,417 --> 00:37:34,125
When they took the land
from the poor...

675
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,417
they believed it was
forever stolen.

676
00:37:39,542 --> 00:37:41,542
But Zapata said to them:

677
00:37:41,583 --> 00:37:44,042
it's better to die on your feet...

678
00:37:44,625 --> 00:37:47,625
than to live on your knees.

679
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:53,833
And they fought.

680
00:38:09,958 --> 00:38:11,090
Hello.

681
00:38:11,125 --> 00:38:15,042
I'd like a table for one.
I hear your risotto is tremendous.

682
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,507
It is tremendous.

683
00:38:16,542 --> 00:38:19,458
- The name on the reservation?
- Hanna Walking.

684
00:38:21,583 --> 00:38:24,042
I'm sorry, sir. I can't
accommodate you.

685
00:38:26,333 --> 00:38:27,458
Those are reserved.

686
00:38:27,542 --> 00:38:30,250
May I recommend one of
our other restaurants?

687
00:38:30,285 --> 00:38:33,875
Ling Su, Cantonesian cuisine.

688
00:38:34,667 --> 00:38:35,667
Great.

689
00:39:02,542 --> 00:39:05,042
<i>Okay it's not a prop, for prop's sake.</i>

690
00:39:06,708 --> 00:39:08,500
<i>No, the Brody can work.</i>

691
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:12,292
What? Just you got the
greatest cover known to men?

692
00:39:12,375 --> 00:39:15,083
Right? So you don't even have to
think about these things anymore.

693
00:39:15,118 --> 00:39:16,458
Congratulations!

694
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,083
No, maybe you're getting soft.

695
00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:22,458
No, I'm not gonna put Danny on...

696
00:39:23,417 --> 00:39:24,625
or Rusty.

697
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:28,000
Just... Goodbye dad.

698
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:31,333
Okay.

699
00:39:31,458 --> 00:39:34,500
I rerouted all the impulses
going to the main randomizer.

700
00:39:34,917 --> 00:39:38,167
In Black Jack the best is 21.

701
00:39:38,708 --> 00:39:39,708
It's called Black Jack.

702
00:39:40,125 --> 00:39:42,875
So the results should be 20's
and Black Jack...

703
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:44,851
to all the players...

704
00:39:44,886 --> 00:39:46,792
with the dealer "bust".

705
00:39:51,792 --> 00:39:52,833
Your call.

706
00:40:01,167 --> 00:40:03,208
Do over. A do over.

707
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:19,125
Okay... I'll keep working.

708
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:21,167
- Good.
- Great.

709
00:40:23,833 --> 00:40:26,750
Yes, I'll have the dumplings and
the Shataki mushroom...

710
00:40:26,792 --> 00:40:28,417
and a sparkling water.

711
00:41:22,167 --> 00:41:23,167
Staff...

712
00:41:24,958 --> 00:41:26,167
casino...

713
00:41:27,292 --> 00:41:28,375
food...

714
00:41:29,458 --> 00:41:31,167
room cleanliness.

715
00:42:08,958 --> 00:42:11,208
<i>At this point...
there's nothing I can do to help.</i>

716
00:42:11,243 --> 00:42:12,757
He said that he'd be...

717
00:42:12,792 --> 00:42:14,625
Cum îi zice?
Ambulatory by now.

718
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:17,792
- Are you keeping his spirits.
- We're working on it.

719
00:42:17,827 --> 00:42:18,833
Thanks Stan.

720
00:42:20,917 --> 00:42:22,923
Oh no, that's way too much.

721
00:42:22,958 --> 00:42:24,625
- No.
- It's not like I removed a bullet.

722
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,667
This side.

723
00:42:29,042 --> 00:42:31,250
- Dr. Stan! - Hey Linus, how's it going?
- Great.

724
00:42:31,292 --> 00:42:33,208
- We're dead.
- What are you talking about?

725
00:42:33,243 --> 00:42:35,090
- The factory in Mexico is offline.
- Offline?

726
00:42:35,125 --> 00:42:37,208
- What does that mean exactly?
- I couldn't get details.

727
00:42:37,243 --> 00:42:38,500
It just shut down.

728
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,958
- You don't think that...
- Yeah, I do. - Oh boy.

729
00:43:01,625 --> 00:43:05,833
So he says that they want their bread
and they want their roses too.

730
00:43:05,868 --> 00:43:07,833
We better get down there
and straighten this out.

731
00:43:07,868 --> 00:43:10,371
- He doesn't listen to me.
- You're going.

732
00:43:10,406 --> 00:43:12,875
If we don't get this factory
back online...

733
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:14,250
we have to dock this showboat.

734
00:43:17,708 --> 00:43:20,215
What do you mean?
Just the whole operation...

735
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:22,500
Dude, I got the showboat metaphor.
Thank you, Linus.

736
00:43:23,042 --> 00:43:25,583
I gotta get back.

737
00:43:26,208 --> 00:43:27,167
What?

738
00:43:27,708 --> 00:43:30,417
What do you mean "what"?
Little something for the effort, maybe.

739
00:43:31,917 --> 00:43:33,215
We pull tips.

740
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:35,750
The other guys are gonna think I'm kiting.

741
00:43:35,958 --> 00:43:38,417
- Come on. - You want it
to come out of my pocket, or something?

742
00:43:40,292 --> 00:43:41,458
Yeah.

743
00:43:43,292 --> 00:43:45,167
Take it easy.
What's the problem?

744
00:43:46,292 --> 00:43:50,417
The Tricode Optimizers that be into
into the nipple sleeve receivers...

745
00:43:50,452 --> 00:43:52,497
pulverated their lubricating
blides...

746
00:43:52,532 --> 00:43:54,542
up against tension against the sidewalls.

747
00:43:54,577 --> 00:43:55,375
Aha...

748
00:43:55,458 --> 00:43:59,417
Picture a knee but without any
cartilage, bone on bone.

749
00:44:05,875 --> 00:44:07,792
Where does that put us?

750
00:44:10,917 --> 00:44:12,042
Cattled.

751
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:18,125
Okay. The good news is
there's another B600 available.

752
00:44:18,167 --> 00:44:19,625
The one that dug the Chunnel.

753
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:22,042
- I thought we had that one.
- We did.

754
00:44:22,077 --> 00:44:23,382
This one dug from
the French side.

755
00:44:23,417 --> 00:44:26,542
The bad news is with timing this short
we're gonna have to buy this one.

756
00:44:26,577 --> 00:44:28,976
- And it's expensive.
- How much do we have left?

757
00:44:29,011 --> 00:44:31,375
If I tap the whole contingency
just over 10 million.

758
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:32,625
- How close does that get us?
- No.

759
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:33,792
How much is it?

760
00:44:34,042 --> 00:44:35,333
- 30.
- 30?

761
00:44:35,368 --> 00:44:36,625
- 6.
- 6?

762
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:37,625
36.

763
00:44:39,542 --> 00:44:42,458
- Isn't there anyway without the drill?
- The drill is the exit strategy.

764
00:44:42,833 --> 00:44:43,875
Well...

765
00:44:44,625 --> 00:44:46,667
is there a way for us to raise money?

766
00:44:47,125 --> 00:44:49,583
- I got everything I have in this already.
- So do I.

767
00:44:49,618 --> 00:44:51,375
- Me too.
- We all do.

768
00:44:57,292 --> 00:44:59,083
If anyone of us was lying up
on that bed Reuben wouldn't rest...

769
00:44:59,118 --> 00:45:01,048
until he made it right.

770
00:45:01,083 --> 00:45:03,000
I gotta go up there and tell him
that we failed...

771
00:45:03,042 --> 00:45:04,542
and there's nothing we can do about it?

772
00:45:09,667 --> 00:45:12,875
- So we're stopping?
- I'm not saying that. - So what then?

773
00:45:17,042 --> 00:45:18,667
Scuzi, signori.

774
00:45:19,375 --> 00:45:21,104
Mr. Reuben is talking.

775
00:45:21,139 --> 00:45:22,833
He asks for Mr. Danny.

776
00:45:37,292 --> 00:45:39,667
I hear cars pulling in...

777
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:44,667
I hear whispering conversations,
Linus crying.

778
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:48,458
Why don't you tell me what
everyone else seems to know?

779
00:45:51,333 --> 00:45:54,458
Well the thing is...

780
00:45:54,493 --> 00:45:55,833
Wait!

781
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:58,958
Hi.
Good to see you smiling again.

782
00:46:01,083 --> 00:46:02,625
Can I talk to you guys for a second?

783
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:04,000
That's your idea?

784
00:46:04,958 --> 00:46:08,208
Well, we've shaken all the trees,
we've looked under every rock...

785
00:46:08,243 --> 00:46:10,500
we've searched every...

786
00:46:11,125 --> 00:46:13,375
We talked to everybody
we can trust.

787
00:46:13,583 --> 00:46:15,340
I know it's not a great idea,
but it is an idea...

788
00:46:15,375 --> 00:46:17,792
and I think as long as we have one idea
we shouldn't give up.

789
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,667
I was really hoping to avoid
that this time.

790
00:46:31,208 --> 00:46:32,042
Number one.

791
00:46:33,375 --> 00:46:35,750
If any of you is trying to screw me...

792
00:46:35,785 --> 00:46:37,292
he'll be dead.

793
00:46:37,667 --> 00:46:38,792
And I'm gonna be looking in
on the operation...

794
00:46:38,833 --> 00:46:40,375
just to make sure.
Number two.

795
00:46:40,792 --> 00:46:42,417
I'll lend you this money
I am your senior partner.

796
00:46:42,452 --> 00:46:44,458
Last money in, first money out.

797
00:46:45,042 --> 00:46:47,417
And you will double my investment.

798
00:46:48,458 --> 00:46:49,333
Double?

799
00:46:53,625 --> 00:46:56,250
- Is that a "yes"?
- Double.

800
00:47:02,208 --> 00:47:04,750
That monstrosity that Bank
calls a hotel...

801
00:47:04,792 --> 00:47:06,583
casts a shadow over my pool.

802
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:09,250
Break him.

803
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,333
Break him in half.
The man has no taste...

804
00:47:13,542 --> 00:47:15,458
and yet every time
he opens a hotel...

805
00:47:15,493 --> 00:47:17,500
he wins a Royal Review Board...

806
00:47:17,535 --> 00:47:19,208
Five Diamond Award.

807
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,125
Every time he wins the Five
Diamond Award, he celebrates by...

808
00:47:22,208 --> 00:47:23,507
We know.

809
00:47:23,542 --> 00:47:26,375
- By buying one for his wife.
- You mean five.

810
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:29,875
- One is five.
- Number three.

811
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,708
I want you to steal the diamonds.

812
00:47:35,292 --> 00:47:38,458
- No, that's... - Can't be done.
- We don't have the manpower or time.

813
00:47:38,493 --> 00:47:39,875
- Or a way.
- We get caught we go away for life.

814
00:47:39,958 --> 00:47:41,875
We're not gonna risk that
so you can get his diamonds.

815
00:47:42,167 --> 00:47:43,917
They're not for me.

816
00:47:44,667 --> 00:47:46,500
I just want him to lose
what matters most to him.

817
00:47:46,625 --> 00:47:48,507
Do what you want with them.

818
00:47:48,542 --> 00:47:51,625
But you need to steal the diamonds...

819
00:47:51,667 --> 00:47:53,667
or you find somebody else
to finance your drill.

820
00:47:57,125 --> 00:48:01,792
The B600 drill.

821
00:48:01,833 --> 00:48:03,854
So what's the deal with
these diamonds then?

822
00:48:03,889 --> 00:48:05,840
They're out of Tiffany
they're 30 karat each.

823
00:48:05,875 --> 00:48:09,500
Matches the award plaques...
On today's market they'd be worth...

824
00:48:09,535 --> 00:48:11,333
250 million dollars.

825
00:48:11,375 --> 00:48:15,208
Bank's already purchased the next one
in anticipation of winning the award.

826
00:48:15,243 --> 00:48:19,042
The rest are kept in a secure glass
viewing boot at the top of the tower.

827
00:48:19,292 --> 00:48:21,771
- And Benedict said we can keep?
- That's what he said.

828
00:48:21,806 --> 00:48:24,250
Then why want these diamonds
on the agenda to begin with?

829
00:48:24,375 --> 00:48:25,708
Because it can't be done.

830
00:48:27,208 --> 00:48:29,423
This is why revenge jobs
don't work, Daniel.

831
00:48:29,458 --> 00:48:32,875
You put yourself in a position, you know
you should walk away, but you can't.

832
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:35,583
This is how guys die
or go to jail.

833
00:48:35,618 --> 00:48:36,625
Alright.

834
00:48:37,125 --> 00:48:38,792
Does anybody wanna walk away?

835
00:48:41,917 --> 00:48:44,583
- Saul?
- I say I was walking away.

836
00:48:44,667 --> 00:48:46,750
Let's cut the son of a bitch.

837
00:48:48,292 --> 00:48:50,632
Okay. Bank fired Gerry Guapi Maior

838
00:48:50,667 --> 00:48:53,792
and 4 others, just so he could say
he designed the hotel himself.

839
00:48:53,827 --> 00:48:54,792
What this means to us?

840
00:48:55,625 --> 00:48:57,500
There's no set of unified plans.

841
00:48:57,750 --> 00:49:01,173
- Routes?
- According to March 05 plans...

842
00:49:01,208 --> 00:49:06,375
there's interior shafts with potential
access to diamond viewing room.

843
00:49:07,083 --> 00:49:09,125
But the May 05 plans only show
shafts: here and here.

844
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:11,507
September 05 shows no shafts...

845
00:49:11,542 --> 00:49:14,132
and December 06 plans are
the same as...

846
00:49:14,167 --> 00:49:16,167
- How many sets of plans are there?
- That's ten.

847
00:49:18,833 --> 00:49:21,208
Since we can't trust the accuracy
of these drawings...

848
00:49:21,243 --> 00:49:22,340
based on my walking around...

849
00:49:22,375 --> 00:49:25,132
these are the shafts we have to
clap an eyeball on.

850
00:49:25,167 --> 00:49:28,333
Now there's no knowledge of floor
thickness underneath the diamonds.

851
00:49:28,368 --> 00:49:30,417
Anything thicker than 5 inches
we have a problem.

852
00:49:30,458 --> 00:49:32,083
Right.

853
00:49:32,792 --> 00:49:35,465
This here is the elevator shaft...

854
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,917
which can be accessed through
a super high roller villa.

855
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:40,257
- Got it?
- Alright.

856
00:49:40,292 --> 00:49:42,500
So who's gonna be our super high roller?

857
00:50:05,875 --> 00:50:07,792
I'm so sorry to been
a little tardy mister..?

858
00:50:07,833 --> 00:50:11,000
Pepperidge, Lenny Pepperidge.
I'm Mr. Weng's communicator.

859
00:50:11,833 --> 00:50:14,000
He'd like you to know that
he was waiting for 7 minutes.

860
00:50:15,333 --> 00:50:17,291
We've received your 10 million
dollar cash deposit...

861
00:50:17,326 --> 00:50:19,250
and I would like you to know
that what we normally do...

862
00:50:19,285 --> 00:50:21,215
Mr. Weng won't take a line.

863
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:23,750
He's a man of extraordinary
discipline.

864
00:50:23,875 --> 00:50:26,632
He's willing to risk 10 million,
not a dollar more.

865
00:50:26,667 --> 00:50:28,375
Did you say Mr. Weng was in
real estate, Mr. Pepperidge?

866
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:30,617
That's right.

867
00:50:29,958 --> 00:50:31,708
I only ask because his name...

868
00:50:31,792 --> 00:50:34,215
doesn't come up on our
standard file database.

869
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:37,340
And Mr. Weng and I have worked
very hard to keep it that way.

870
00:50:37,375 --> 00:50:41,292
Exactly what kind of real estate did
you say that Mr. Weng was involved?

871
00:50:41,327 --> 00:50:44,917
Look he owns all the air
south of Beijing.

872
00:50:45,458 --> 00:50:48,090
- The air?
- Put it to you this way...

873
00:50:48,125 --> 00:50:49,792
try building something larger
than 3 stories...

874
00:50:49,827 --> 00:50:51,465
in the Tianjin province...

875
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,750
see if his name comes up
in your database then.

876
00:50:56,625 --> 00:50:59,792
How quickly can you transfer his money
from your cage to the cage at the Bellagio?

877
00:50:59,827 --> 00:51:01,507
Now I don't think that's necessary...

878
00:51:01,542 --> 00:51:05,167
at all Mr. Pepperidge, we've
reserved our largest villa for Mr. Weng.

879
00:51:20,208 --> 00:51:22,417
Extension 765.

880
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,715
Hello Robert.
This is Abigail Sponder.

881
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:26,708
Your bureau introduced
us not too long ago...

882
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:28,750
at the gaming fraud seminar.

883
00:51:30,708 --> 00:51:33,229
I remember you.
What can I do for you, Miss Sponder?

884
00:51:33,264 --> 00:51:35,750
Well, you know... We're about
to open a new property...

885
00:51:35,785 --> 00:51:36,667
and there are a couple of
characters here...

886
00:51:36,875 --> 00:51:38,708
I'm not to sure about.

887
00:51:38,833 --> 00:51:41,458
Why don't you give me their names
and I'll check them out.

888
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Up you go.

889
00:51:57,958 --> 00:51:59,625
- What do you mean you're not going?
- You gotta go.

890
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:01,215
Too fast?

891
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:03,417
You did the bullet train stunt
with all of Asia watching...

892
00:52:03,458 --> 00:52:05,458
elevators aren't faster than that.

893
00:52:08,042 --> 00:52:09,132
That was C.G.I.?

894
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:11,042
Wait, so this one got legs?

895
00:52:12,583 --> 00:52:13,333
Jesus.

896
00:52:14,708 --> 00:52:17,292
- Okay then.
- We're down again.

897
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,167
Well what about Rouben?

898
00:52:21,125 --> 00:52:24,715
- Well
- It's just a living.

899
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:27,458
I mean, if we paid somebody
to read to him.

900
00:52:27,542 --> 00:52:28,792
Maybe he'll see his
next birthday.

901
00:52:29,792 --> 00:52:31,500
- January?
- I don't think so.

902
00:52:31,958 --> 00:52:33,042
Shit.

903
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:37,958
Shit. Shit. Shit.

904
00:53:22,667 --> 00:53:23,792
Shit.

905
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:31,000
And then what happened?

906
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:33,708
She said she liked surprises.

907
00:53:33,875 --> 00:53:34,833
I don't think that's what she meant.

908
00:53:34,868 --> 00:53:35,840
You think?

909
00:53:35,875 --> 00:53:40,000
- So she put down the remote.
- And I put the towel back on.

910
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:42,375
Now, those are the waters.

911
00:53:43,417 --> 00:53:44,875
- Relationships can be...
- Sure.

912
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:47,000
- But they're also...
- That's right.

913
00:53:50,833 --> 00:53:52,375
I've gone through so many
blueprints...

914
00:53:52,410 --> 00:53:53,750
I can taste the ink
on my fingers.

915
00:53:53,785 --> 00:53:54,583
Yeah...

916
00:53:54,625 --> 00:53:57,708
The only other access point is through
the main air-conditioning duct.

917
00:53:57,743 --> 00:54:00,000
- We gotta move that guard.
- We don't have anything on him.

918
00:54:00,035 --> 00:54:01,000
Let's find something.

919
00:54:02,083 --> 00:54:03,917
I can get to the helipad from there too

920
00:54:03,958 --> 00:54:05,167
Let's find something.

921
00:54:08,958 --> 00:54:11,125
this used to be the dunes.

922
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:16,250
Reuben thought me to shoot craps
here when I was a kid.

923
00:54:17,542 --> 00:54:20,542
We'd play hardware and
double sixes.

924
00:54:21,125 --> 00:54:22,583
He straightened me out.

925
00:54:23,208 --> 00:54:26,833
I was 20... 2.

926
00:54:29,583 --> 00:54:30,792
First time I met Reuben...

927
00:54:31,333 --> 00:54:35,042
he looked me off getting cheated
at an old dealer's game at the old rancher.

928
00:54:36,167 --> 00:54:37,708
and he bought me breakfast.

929
00:54:41,583 --> 00:54:44,083
Sands was there... Desert Inn.

930
00:54:46,708 --> 00:54:48,583
They built them a lot smaller back then.

931
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:50,833
They seemed pretty big.

932
00:54:53,125 --> 00:54:54,375
The town has changed.

933
00:56:04,708 --> 00:56:07,042
<i>You know if I read
one more puff</i>

934
00:56:07,292 --> 00:56:09,917
<i>piece about Vegas legend,
Terry Benedict...</i>

935
00:56:10,167 --> 00:56:12,042
<i>I'm gonna have to buy
a magazine of my own.</i>

936
00:56:12,375 --> 00:56:14,667
<i>And I haven't forgotten about that phone.</i>

937
00:56:15,167 --> 00:56:18,000
<i>Ah, the gold model, the one
that retails for 10.000.</i>

938
00:56:18,417 --> 00:56:22,667
<i>The double light Samsung.
Okay, that would be... Ungettable.</i>

939
00:56:22,917 --> 00:56:25,375
<i>No, no... You call Teddy Sanders
of promotion.</i>

940
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:27,923
<i>I did that and he promised you...</i>

941
00:56:27,958 --> 00:56:31,250
<i>the very first one as soon as
it comes of the line in September.</i>

942
00:56:31,285 --> 00:56:32,583
<i>That's July for me.</i>

943
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:42,375
What did you say about Samsung?

944
00:56:42,417 --> 00:56:44,375
He said he used to bowl with
the owner of Samsung.

945
00:56:46,333 --> 00:56:47,833
Well call Danny.

946
00:56:48,708 --> 00:56:52,417
Oh and tell Danny I know the perfect guy
we can use for the role-play at the Expo.

947
00:57:04,042 --> 00:57:06,083
We're worried dress up this.

948
00:57:06,458 --> 00:57:08,083
We were!
We are.

949
00:57:08,118 --> 00:57:09,458
Randall is.

950
00:57:09,667 --> 00:57:12,167
- I must have put...
- Don't blame yourself...

951
00:57:12,202 --> 00:57:13,750
I should have fired you
a week ago.

952
00:57:15,208 --> 00:57:16,583
Bye.

953
00:57:20,417 --> 00:57:21,708
Are you having a nice stay?

954
00:57:26,125 --> 00:57:27,417
And you, sir

955
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:29,208
How's your Bank experience?

956
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Can I be of any personal
assistance to you?

957
00:57:35,458 --> 00:57:38,167
This is quit unorthodox.

958
00:57:38,208 --> 00:57:42,250
I have never found myself talking
directly to a hotel owner.

959
00:57:43,125 --> 00:57:45,750
I understand, you're just a customer.

960
00:57:45,785 --> 00:57:48,375
And I am just an engaged
innkeeper.

961
00:57:48,958 --> 00:57:51,000
- Spot on.
- Spot on.

962
00:57:51,667 --> 00:57:53,833
Well, so far,
in my book...

963
00:57:54,958 --> 00:57:58,333
this establishment is: aces.

964
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:01,208
Aces? That's good.

965
00:58:01,292 --> 00:58:04,292
The ace of diamonds, I hope.

966
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:08,792
I see what you...
Diamonds, indeed, yes.

967
00:58:20,708 --> 00:58:21,833
- Hey.
- Hey.

968
00:58:21,958 --> 00:58:25,333
Okay the guard by the main elevator
shaft has a full Hitler for a son.

969
00:58:26,875 --> 00:58:27,750
- Yeah.
- You okay?

970
00:58:27,792 --> 00:58:31,333
- Yeah, no, I just bit into a pepper.
- Anyway...

971
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,750
Is that... Are you...

972
00:58:38,583 --> 00:58:39,833
Are you watching Oprah?

973
00:58:41,875 --> 00:58:45,542
With a bottle of wine?
Did you TIVO this.

974
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:48,583
- I was reading the paper.
- With the sound of her volume?

975
00:58:51,833 --> 00:58:56,750
<i>Not one, not two, not three
but twelve new beds...</i>

976
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:10,604
It's not just about the kids,

977
00:59:10,639 --> 00:59:12,458
I mean I'm happy for the kids.

978
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:16,132
<i>So I think we've come up with
the answer to your prayers...</i>

979
00:59:16,167 --> 00:59:18,542
<i>This is what I think we gonna do:
we are buying you a house!</i>

980
00:59:18,583 --> 00:59:20,125
How's it going in Mexico?

981
00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:23,667
Turk's there.

982
00:59:25,083 --> 00:59:27,333
Are they really gonna built her a new home?

983
00:59:27,375 --> 00:59:28,417
Yeah, the whole family.

984
00:59:47,042 --> 00:59:49,375
<i>- What could I say?
- That's what I said.</i>

985
00:59:50,542 --> 00:59:52,798
Hey.

986
00:59:52,833 --> 00:59:54,833
You guys been talking to my father?

987
00:59:54,875 --> 00:59:56,667
Why would we do that?

988
00:59:57,125 --> 00:59:58,750
That's not to know.

989
00:59:59,625 --> 01:00:00,882
Well, look...

990
01:00:00,917 --> 01:00:03,375
we just wanted to know
how the nose was working.

991
01:00:03,542 --> 01:00:07,000
I knew it, man. He just
can't leave it alone.

992
01:00:07,035 --> 01:00:08,167
What did he say?

993
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:11,048
Oh I told him...
The nose plays.

994
01:00:11,083 --> 01:00:12,583
- The nose does play.
- It's great. Great stuff.

995
01:00:12,618 --> 01:00:13,625
Thanks.

996
01:00:13,708 --> 01:00:15,250
Turk?

997
01:00:15,333 --> 01:00:18,000
Hey, are you gonna get
the factory open?

998
01:00:18,083 --> 01:00:19,958
Oh yes, we just got a great management.

999
01:00:20,833 --> 01:00:23,333
They can't be treating us like this.

1000
01:00:23,368 --> 01:00:24,833
Well, I gotta go.

1001
01:00:58,542 --> 01:01:00,417
<i>- Yeah, Ortega here.
- Mr. Ortega, this is...</i>

1002
01:01:00,452 --> 01:01:02,667
<i>- vice principal Meckler.
- Oh no...</i>

1003
01:01:02,708 --> 01:01:06,000
<i>I'm afraid so, we've had another
incident with Manny and Miss Kelso.</i>

1004
01:01:06,083 --> 01:01:07,667
It was the leg this time.

1005
01:01:07,875 --> 01:01:09,667
I need somebody to come down
and pick him up.

1006
01:01:09,702 --> 01:01:10,583
My wife can't...

1007
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:14,000
<i>I'm sorry sir, your wife we haven't been
able to get a hold off. We left messages.</i>

1008
01:01:16,875 --> 01:01:18,208
Yo-yo-yo-yo buddy-buddy-buddy,
do me a favor.

1009
01:01:18,243 --> 01:01:20,458
Cover my post
for half an hour.

1010
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:22,257
Oh man, I just gotta go...

1011
01:01:22,292 --> 01:01:23,958
Come on man, help me out...
my kid just his leg again.

1012
01:01:23,993 --> 01:01:24,958
- Really?
- Yeah.

1013
01:01:25,083 --> 01:01:27,750
- Alright man, I owe you one, alright.
- Yeah, you do.

1014
01:02:07,375 --> 01:02:09,757
Alright...

1015
01:02:09,792 --> 01:02:12,792
according to this...

1016
01:02:12,833 --> 01:02:14,833
the room where the diamonds
are held...

1017
01:02:14,868 --> 01:02:17,125
is directly above here.

1018
01:02:34,042 --> 01:02:37,792
<i>$250,000,000 worth of diamonds,
18" of floor concrete in the way.</i>

1019
01:02:38,917 --> 01:02:40,833
<i>Man, we can't drill through that.</i>

1020
01:02:44,542 --> 01:02:46,208
It's just one thing too many.

1021
01:02:46,250 --> 01:02:48,250
Look, we're talking about
a secure room, Terry.

1022
01:02:48,542 --> 01:02:51,208
This isn't just a glass box
these diamonds are housed in.

1023
01:02:51,243 --> 01:02:53,125
This is 2" thick concussion proof glass...

1024
01:02:53,667 --> 01:02:56,250
wired with pressure sensitive
7 digit coded alarms.

1025
01:02:57,792 --> 01:02:59,882
Kill the power to the hotel.
It's worked for you before.

1026
01:02:59,917 --> 01:03:03,750
No-no-no. See the case and the alarm
both have independent power supply.

1027
01:03:03,785 --> 01:03:05,375
And besides you don't run
the same gag twice...

1028
01:03:05,625 --> 01:03:07,208
you do the next gag.

1029
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,125
How big a deal is it
if we don't get the diamonds?

1030
01:03:14,625 --> 01:03:15,958
You have all your fares in order?

1031
01:03:18,583 --> 01:03:20,583
Alright, so what we'll have to do...

1032
01:03:20,625 --> 01:03:24,590
is get inside that glass case
and switching the replicas.

1033
01:03:24,625 --> 01:03:28,167
How are we supposed to get in the room?
Bank is the only one with access, right?

1034
01:03:28,667 --> 01:03:30,625
- Sponder has too.
- Sponder has access?

1035
01:03:30,708 --> 01:03:32,750
Then we're in.

1036
01:03:32,833 --> 01:03:36,500
Sponder is a...

1037
01:03:36,583 --> 01:03:38,542
believe the term is "cougar".

1038
01:03:41,708 --> 01:03:44,250
It's not my term.
I read about it in Maxim magazine.

1039
01:03:47,375 --> 01:03:48,875
Okay, well let's get Rusty
in position.

1040
01:03:48,917 --> 01:03:51,917
No-no-no not Rusty... Me.
I'm in. I'm already in there.

1041
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:55,458
I put this whole thing in motion
before I even realized it.

1042
01:03:55,542 --> 01:03:57,000
I'm so deep into Pepperidge...

1043
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:59,208
I don't even think, I just react
I am him.

1044
01:04:00,542 --> 01:04:02,500
You know it. Great. Great.

1045
01:04:02,535 --> 01:04:04,458
Would you just tell them.

1046
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:08,708
Now you don't understand English?

1047
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:15,208
He's not trying not to laugh. You know what?

1048
01:04:15,243 --> 01:04:16,667
I can do it.

1049
01:04:16,833 --> 01:04:19,215
He says he can do it.

1050
01:04:19,250 --> 01:04:21,542
- Alright Linus, go get her.
- Alright.

1051
01:04:21,833 --> 01:04:24,125
- Give him the accelerator.
- Natural? Chemical?

1052
01:04:24,292 --> 01:04:26,708
- I don't need an accelerator.
- Make it powerful.

1053
01:04:26,833 --> 01:04:28,007
Thanks a lot.

1054
01:04:28,042 --> 01:04:29,083
I'll play it at Gilroy.

1055
01:04:29,833 --> 01:04:33,000
- You don't need a...
- Just one Gilroy, last time you did...

1056
01:04:33,167 --> 01:04:34,667
News from Mexico.

1057
01:04:34,750 --> 01:04:37,500
From a journalist I used to...

1058
01:04:37,708 --> 01:04:39,625
She's an ally of the workers.

1059
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:42,500
What she tells me is that the strike...

1060
01:04:42,535 --> 01:04:43,958
hinges on working conditions...

1061
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,708
and the fact that labor
are underpaid by 50%.

1062
01:04:47,792 --> 01:04:50,833
I'm sure you all agree
is always about the money.

1063
01:04:51,583 --> 01:04:53,917
- Ho much are we talking about?
- 36.000.

1064
01:04:54,250 --> 01:04:56,292
- How many workers?
- 200. Give or take.

1065
01:04:56,875 --> 01:04:59,625
- Alright, that's..
- Just over 7 million dollars.

1066
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:02,708
No-no-no not 36k per person...

1067
01:05:02,792 --> 01:05:04,750
36 total.

1068
01:05:05,750 --> 01:05:09,792
Turk, you virtually got him
holding out for $3.50 a week?

1069
01:05:09,827 --> 01:05:11,167
It is a 5% increase.

1070
01:05:11,292 --> 01:05:14,667
We ran him a check.

1071
01:05:14,875 --> 01:05:16,708
We'll postdate it.

1072
01:06:18,875 --> 01:06:22,375
Say to my brother to keep
his ears shut.

1073
01:06:37,542 --> 01:06:38,583
<i>This is Roman Nagel...</i>

absolutely has to intrude upon mine...</i>

1076

1078
01:06:52,993 --> 01:06:55,517

could help me out.</i>

1079
01:06:55,552 --> 01:06:58,042

1080

1081

1084
01:07:10,167 --> 01:07:12,458
So, call me when you get this.

1085
01:07:12,667 --> 01:07:15,958
Okay? Okay.
Bye.

1086
01:07:24,917 --> 01:07:26,625
Is Sponder with him?

1087
01:07:27,042 --> 01:07:28,792
<i>A whole new segment...</i>

1088
01:07:29,167 --> 01:07:31,583
<i>- Which car?
- That's a lot to sober...</i>

1089
01:07:31,667 --> 01:07:33,090
Which rolls?

1090
01:07:33,125 --> 01:07:34,125
<i>Exclusive rights...</i>

1091
01:07:34,958 --> 01:07:38,708
What's the ETA? Okay.

1092
01:07:39,708 --> 01:07:41,333
He's on his way.

1093
01:07:41,583 --> 01:07:44,333
- Think he's gonna fall for this?
- You did.

1094
01:07:45,583 --> 01:07:47,958
You're ready?

1095
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,042
I was born ready.

1096
01:08:05,667 --> 01:08:06,667
Who advances?

1097
01:08:11,917 --> 01:08:13,625
- how are you?
- Good to see you.

1098
01:08:13,667 --> 01:08:15,167
I caught your show that kid is great.

1099
01:08:15,208 --> 01:08:18,667
Thank you for that. Congratulations on the
enormity of your success.

1100
01:08:18,708 --> 01:08:21,000
- Back at you.
- Love and respect. Peace.

1101
01:08:21,292 --> 01:08:22,417
Good seeing you, Bernie.

1102
01:08:24,042 --> 01:08:29,042
Allow me to introduce to you
the greatest advance in gaming.

1103
01:08:29,417 --> 01:08:32,250
Get beyond boring cards and tired dice.

1104
01:08:32,458 --> 01:08:35,500
It's electrifying!
It's exciting!

1105
01:08:35,542 --> 01:08:39,417
It's 'Nuff Said.
Yes sir.

1106
01:08:39,458 --> 01:08:43,417
Oh my god, Mr. Bank.
It's an honor, sir.

1107
01:08:43,917 --> 01:08:47,667
May I please give you
a demonstration of casino dominos?

1108
01:08:47,792 --> 01:08:49,708
House says 40%.

1109
01:08:49,833 --> 01:08:51,833
- Is it documented?
- Of course.

1110
01:08:51,958 --> 01:08:54,708
All the action makes the player
feel like they have a fighting chance...

1111
01:08:54,743 --> 01:08:56,750
if you understand my meaning.

1112
01:08:56,875 --> 01:08:58,750
Check it out, ladies and gentlemen
Mr. Bank...

1113
01:08:58,792 --> 01:09:02,333
is gonna give a young and upcoming
gamer a chance. Give him a warm applause.

1114
01:09:03,042 --> 01:09:04,875
Come on now.

1115
01:09:04,958 --> 01:09:06,625
Alright. Make it quick.

1116
01:09:07,417 --> 01:09:09,250
Thank you, sir.

1117
01:09:09,333 --> 01:09:13,292
Mr. Bank, first round
a betting next... Dominos.

1118
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,333
Second round a betting
upcoming community dominos.

1119
01:09:17,542 --> 01:09:20,083
Mr. Bank if a player win
a multiple five...

1120
01:09:20,208 --> 01:09:24,167
on the first spin. He or she
is a winner.

1121
01:09:24,250 --> 01:09:27,208
Pay off five to one.

1122
01:09:27,292 --> 01:09:30,333
Or guess what?
They're already laying 11 to 1,

1123
01:09:30,375 --> 01:09:33,292
so when they win
Mr. Bank...

1124
01:09:33,333 --> 01:09:34,583
we win.

1125
01:09:34,625 --> 01:09:35,792
'Nuff Said.

1126
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,708
That is good.

1127
01:09:38,792 --> 01:09:42,583
I tell you what, why don't
you send me some of your literature...

1128
01:09:42,618 --> 01:09:44,375
and we'll see what we can do.

1129
01:09:44,417 --> 01:09:46,083
Literature, literature, Mr. Bank.

1130
01:09:46,333 --> 01:09:48,958
Come on now. You don't need
to read no literature.

1131
01:09:49,042 --> 01:09:51,042
All you need to do is feel it.

1132
01:09:51,083 --> 01:09:55,333
Well, I feel it, it's just that
I don't know if it's Bankable.

1133
01:09:55,417 --> 01:09:57,167
- Right?
- Bank.

1134
01:09:57,250 --> 01:09:59,500
I'd like to place this game
in one of my casinos.

1135
01:10:00,292 --> 01:10:04,167
Now that's what I'm talkin about.
That's progressive thinking right there.

1136
01:10:05,167 --> 01:10:09,792
And I embrace the fact that 'Nuff Said
might grow a whole new segment in my hotel.

1137
01:10:09,827 --> 01:10:13,000
- Hello!
- And I like a lot this, so right now.

1138
01:10:13,292 --> 01:10:18,000
Exclusive rights on a place
this beautiful domino table...

1139
01:10:18,042 --> 01:10:19,292
at our Tulico location.

1140
01:10:19,875 --> 01:10:23,083
Mississippi, that's where, games
gonna die, ain't it.

1141
01:10:23,125 --> 01:10:25,000
Stay out of this, Bank.
You've already passed.

1142
01:10:25,125 --> 01:10:27,667
Really?
And do for him what I'm prepared to.

1143
01:10:28,583 --> 01:10:32,625
Prime placement centre room Vegas
tonight.

1144
01:10:54,042 --> 01:10:57,583
Now Mr. Bank has 3 minutes.
You got one. Go!

1145
01:10:57,917 --> 01:11:03,840
Okay well,

1146
01:11:03,875 --> 01:11:06,590
- When is the jump?
- The motorcycle?

1147
01:11:06,625 --> 01:11:10,708
Mr. Roads will jump his motorcycle
through the fireworks and over the Bank...

1148
01:11:10,750 --> 01:11:11,833
You guys gotta get together...

1149
01:11:11,868 --> 01:11:13,458
fireworks and stunts.

1150
01:11:13,542 --> 01:11:16,292
Are you gonna be on the same pay
because of all eyes in Vegas...

1151
01:11:16,333 --> 01:11:19,000
gonna be on me.
It's gotta be perfect.

1152
01:11:20,375 --> 01:11:22,292
- I'll take you from the top.
- Yes, sir.

1153
01:11:22,875 --> 01:11:25,250
- At round about 12 o'clock.
- Not around about, at 12.

1154
01:11:25,833 --> 01:11:27,458
<i>The stroke of midnight.</i>

1155
01:11:27,667 --> 01:11:29,417
<i>Go off to navy master clock.</i>

1156
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:31,833
<i>Oh, don't make a maniac out of me.</i>

1157
01:11:40,958 --> 01:11:42,208
Where the hell are they go?

1158
01:11:42,250 --> 01:11:44,208
I don't really know what's
happening, sir...

1159
01:11:44,375 --> 01:11:49,417
we just lost two dozen of our
biggest players without an explanation.

1160
01:11:49,458 --> 01:11:50,958
Well, get an explanation.

1161
01:11:57,625 --> 01:12:01,375
Miss Sponder, this just came in:
Rush Express Hand Deliver.

1162
01:12:04,125 --> 01:12:07,667
Oh, thank you... Thank you. Thanks.

1163
01:12:08,583 --> 01:12:09,875
My pleasure.

1164
01:12:35,292 --> 01:12:36,667
Guys, let's go.

1165
01:12:45,250 --> 01:12:48,000
<i>My dear Mr. Bank
this is a thank you...</i>

1166
01:12:48,042 --> 01:12:50,333
<i>for all that you've given me...</i>

1167
01:12:50,417 --> 01:12:53,750
<i>the opportunity,
the kindness, the warmth...</i>

1168
01:12:56,125 --> 01:12:59,458
The one you couldn't get, huh?

1169
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:02,125
The one you couldn't get...

1170
01:13:31,708 --> 01:13:35,500
<i><b>The grand opening.</b></i>

1171
01:14:50,417 --> 01:14:52,250
How did Ocean get
on my big plans?

1172
01:14:52,417 --> 01:14:54,250
Would you like me to have more notes, sir?

1173
01:14:55,375 --> 01:14:57,292
Don't go with him.

1174
01:15:01,833 --> 01:15:03,875
- Hey.
- How are the matches?

1175
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:05,792
Why don't you come to see for yourself?

1176
01:15:42,292 --> 01:15:45,917
Why don't you give me one reason
not to bounce your ass out of my place?

1177
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,208
You know the reason and already
decided before you came here.

1178
01:15:49,875 --> 01:15:52,250
They were all booked here.
You took them.

1179
01:15:53,042 --> 01:15:54,125
What did you do?
Bribe them?

1180
01:15:54,292 --> 01:15:56,875
Buy them?
Check them?

1181
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,167
Yes.

1182
01:15:59,208 --> 01:16:01,042
You brought them here to rub it in my face.

1183
01:16:02,667 --> 01:16:07,333
You know?
You're half smart, Ocean.

1184
01:16:07,375 --> 01:16:09,583
Why don't you get real smart?

1185
01:16:10,208 --> 01:16:12,417
Let them play here.

1186
01:16:12,458 --> 01:16:15,000
And I'll give you 10% of their losses.

1187
01:16:16,583 --> 01:16:18,625
Now you give it to Reuben
if that makes you feel...

1188
01:16:18,667 --> 01:16:21,000
I'm not that easy.
You almost killed him.

1189
01:16:21,167 --> 01:16:25,625
20% whenever they gamble here.

1190
01:16:25,667 --> 01:16:27,375
20?

1191
01:16:28,667 --> 01:16:31,125
So it's done.

1192
01:16:31,417 --> 01:16:32,208
How do I know?

1193
01:16:32,250 --> 01:16:34,750
They cash out every night
settling cash.

1194
01:16:35,292 --> 01:16:37,208
Otherwise take him back again.

1195
01:16:40,292 --> 01:16:41,292
They'll need villas.

1196
01:16:41,375 --> 01:16:43,916
Villas?

1197
01:16:43,951 --> 01:16:46,458
Okay.

1198
01:16:50,417 --> 01:16:55,083
Let's go boys. Here we go. Alright.

1199
01:16:55,125 --> 01:16:56,667
Let's hit the tables.

1200
01:16:56,833 --> 01:17:00,792
<i>But I say: why not feel it?
Why not feel the rush?</i>

1201
01:17:00,833 --> 01:17:03,333
<i>Come on, take a trip.
Shake my hand.</i>

1202
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:04,750
<i>Who knows?</i>

1203
01:17:05,167 --> 01:17:08,583
<i>Maybe you have what it takes
to break the Bank. Whoops.</i>

1204
01:17:16,333 --> 01:17:17,583
Long pass check out time, sir.

1205
01:17:17,625 --> 01:17:19,708
What? I'm in no condition to check out.

1206
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:21,792
You've overstayed your reservation, sir.

1207
01:17:21,833 --> 01:17:22,708
We need the room.

1208
01:17:22,792 --> 01:17:24,542
But Nevada Inn keep
un regulament în privinþa...

1209
01:17:25,333 --> 01:17:27,500
Except in case of public
health and safety, sir.

1210
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,833
An occupant of instance is flagrant and
disregard for expectable standards.

1211
01:17:32,875 --> 01:17:34,042
I've not been disregarding my hygiene.

1212
01:17:34,208 --> 01:17:36,083
Sir, I'm trying to say is...

1213
01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:38,750
- you've gone nose deaf.
- What?

1214
01:17:38,792 --> 01:17:40,625
You're oblivious to your fact
on other guests.

1215
01:17:40,708 --> 01:17:42,000
I really don't see what effect, I've had...

1216
01:17:42,125 --> 01:17:45,583
15 minutes, 15 minutes, 15 minutes...

1217
01:17:45,625 --> 01:17:47,000
15... Hey... 15 Minutes.

1218
01:17:47,083 --> 01:17:50,667
Pack your things or we will do
that for you. Get the picture?

1219
01:17:50,708 --> 01:17:52,875
- Do you get the picture, sir?
- Pack your things.

1220
01:17:52,917 --> 01:17:57,250
- Pack your things!
- Okay.

1221
01:17:57,292 --> 01:17:58,875
Okay.

1222
01:18:07,833 --> 01:18:10,250
The Gilroy

1223
01:18:25,208 --> 01:18:28,917
- Well hello there.
- There are no tomorrows, Mr. Pepperidge.

1224
01:18:53,208 --> 01:18:54,917
Call me Lenny.

1225
01:19:01,125 --> 01:19:02,333
I need this room.

1226
01:19:05,625 --> 01:19:07,250
I gave Mr. Cheng...

1227
01:19:10,208 --> 01:19:12,208
Mr. Weng a chance.

1228
01:19:17,292 --> 01:19:20,333
I need the Asian villas
all the Asian villas.

1229
01:19:23,042 --> 01:19:25,417
Perhaps you'd like to tell...

1230
01:19:25,458 --> 01:19:27,917
Mr. Weng yourself.

1231
01:19:33,292 --> 01:19:36,000
In fact, I would, I would because...

1232
01:19:36,042 --> 01:19:38,708
uh you know the last time we spoke...

1233
01:19:39,625 --> 01:19:41,417
he was quit rude to me.

1234
01:19:42,333 --> 01:19:43,667
Well in that case you'll...

1235
01:19:43,708 --> 01:19:45,423
find him somewhere...

1236
01:19:45,458 --> 01:19:49,292
between the cashier's cage
and the high stakes room.

1237
01:19:51,125 --> 01:19:52,833
He was about to eat...

1238
01:19:52,875 --> 01:19:55,000
when the mood to play suddenly hit him.

1239
01:19:56,917 --> 01:19:59,125
It just hit him, just like that?

1240
01:20:00,458 --> 01:20:02,667
Well I might have said something
to encourage him.

1241
01:20:06,042 --> 01:20:08,083
Why would you do that?

1242
01:20:08,167 --> 01:20:10,125
When you work for a powerful man...

1243
01:20:11,917 --> 01:20:15,750
sometimes the collar
can get a little tight.

1244
01:20:21,250 --> 01:20:22,500
Excuse me.

1245
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:35,917
- Is it on?
- Yeah.

1246
01:20:38,542 --> 01:20:39,667
Thanks, homes.

1247
01:20:42,292 --> 01:20:43,917
Lester says: hang tough.

1248
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,125
Mr. Bank,
I just wanna thank you...

1249
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:58,250
for throwing me
out of your hotel.

1250
01:20:59,917 --> 01:21:02,958
- And who are you?
- Nobody.

1251
01:21:11,083 --> 01:21:13,208
- Alright, fellows...
- See ya later

1252
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:21,292
Careful!

1253
01:21:21,375 --> 01:21:22,542
Vorbesc serios...

1254
01:21:42,708 --> 01:21:45,958
We're gonna need you standing by
on the support capacitor.

1255
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:52,590
<i>Bad news just walked in.</i>

1256
01:21:52,625 --> 01:21:54,208
Alright, the Bureau is in the house.

1257
01:21:54,292 --> 01:21:56,708
They move towards Black Jack
somebody tip Livingston.

1258
01:21:56,958 --> 01:21:58,792
Well, let me welcome you to the Bank...

1259
01:21:58,827 --> 01:22:01,542
with our finest Kabota sake.

1260
01:22:01,833 --> 01:22:03,833
And good to have you back, Denny...

1261
01:22:03,875 --> 01:22:05,667
got some great on ice.

1262
01:22:06,792 --> 01:22:07,792
Enjoy!

1263
01:22:23,750 --> 01:22:25,083
Livingston Dell...

1264
01:22:25,167 --> 01:22:26,458
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

1265
01:22:27,708 --> 01:22:28,792
We got all the exits covered.

1266
01:22:28,833 --> 01:22:31,458
You got nowhere to go.
Don't be stupid.

1267
01:22:37,542 --> 01:22:39,333
Ho, hey!

1268
01:22:39,375 --> 01:22:40,792
What is going on here?

1269
01:22:41,625 --> 01:22:42,833
<i>You've been breached.</i>

1270
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,500
<i>We've had this man
under surveillance.</i>

1271
01:22:44,535 --> 01:22:45,875
<i>He rigs the sheets.</i>

1272
01:22:47,250 --> 01:22:49,833
- He rigs them?
- We've been in contact with his company.

1273
01:22:50,042 --> 01:22:52,208
His background information was bogus.

1274
01:22:54,625 --> 01:22:57,292
- How many machines he's done?
- I'm not sure.

1275
01:22:58,875 --> 01:23:00,708
Ah well, just change him out.

1276
01:23:00,833 --> 01:23:01,708
We won't have enough.

1277
01:23:01,750 --> 01:23:03,458
The company is sending over new machines.

1278
01:23:03,583 --> 01:23:06,167
Well if he raged machines
he's working with players.

1279
01:23:06,417 --> 01:23:09,208
We know he's involved with confederates.
We just don't know who they are.

1280
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:11,875
If you see anything that looks unusual...

1281
01:23:11,917 --> 01:23:13,042
you contact us.

1282
01:23:13,083 --> 01:23:15,917
You bet.
You think this is over?

1283
01:23:15,958 --> 01:23:18,250
This isn't over.
I'm pressing charges.

1284
01:23:18,458 --> 01:23:21,125
State and Federal charges.
Got it?

1285
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:23,250
Now, get him off my floor.
Come on!

1286
01:23:29,250 --> 01:23:31,375
- His fingerprints were all over.
- Yes, sir.

1287
01:23:31,417 --> 01:23:34,625
I need a name and
all known criminal associates.

1288
01:23:35,750 --> 01:23:38,125
Bank's gonna run the prints of
the Shuffle machine.

1289
01:23:38,792 --> 01:23:41,542
<i>Dell, he's good. He gets
Livingston's ID.</i>

1290
01:23:41,583 --> 01:23:42,958
<i>and known associates.</i>

1291
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,583
<i>That's us.</i>

1292
01:23:44,625 --> 01:23:46,667
<i>What do we have in place for this?</i>

1293
01:23:46,750 --> 01:23:49,708
<i>Nothing. They'll scoop us all up
and Bank will have...</i>

1294
01:23:49,750 --> 01:23:51,000
<i>the best night of his life.</i>

1295
01:23:51,125 --> 01:23:52,875
<i>We can't let it get to Bank.</i>

1296
01:23:55,167 --> 01:23:56,208
I know what to do.

1297
01:23:56,458 --> 01:23:59,500
We'll set up a Cartwheel
Back at the house... 15 Minutes.

1298
01:24:00,625 --> 01:24:01,708
<i>Who's gonna hack this?</i>

1299
01:24:02,542 --> 01:24:05,167
Well the ideal person is in
the back of a car in handcuffs.

1300
01:24:05,250 --> 01:24:06,708
<i>I can handle it.</i>

1301
01:24:06,917 --> 01:24:08,167
<i>Is anyone else available?</i>

1302
01:24:08,458 --> 01:24:10,000
<i>This is Virgil.
I'll give it a shot.</i>

1303
01:24:10,208 --> 01:24:11,292
<i>I can handle it.</i>

1304
01:24:11,333 --> 01:24:12,750
<i>Virgil it is.
Get it done, Virgil.</i>

1305
01:24:38,792 --> 01:24:41,458
Switch these out first
and do the main floor.

1306
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:42,875
Excellent.

1307
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:48,958
Alright, time for the starters now
Rusty, what's your 20?

1308
01:24:52,875 --> 01:24:54,208
Anybody got eyes on Rusty?

1309
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,167
It's a two men play...

1310
01:24:59,208 --> 01:25:02,333
Back in range. Just had to make
the last minute pick up.

1311
01:25:03,708 --> 01:25:04,458
Hi boys.

1312
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:06,458
<i>- Hey, there he is!
- Hey, Reuben! - There my man!</i>

1313
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:08,458
<i>- Reuben, welcome back.
- Missed you buddy.</i>

1314
01:25:13,625 --> 01:25:15,250
Let's raise the minimum.

1315
01:25:15,292 --> 01:25:16,792
I'd like to play all the suits.

1316
01:25:41,875 --> 01:25:44,750
- Really, pineapple?
- Yeah...

1317
01:25:46,375 --> 01:25:49,167
No-what-what-no-no not here, not here...
I could lose my job.

1318
01:25:49,208 --> 01:25:53,083
Oh doesn't the forbidden make it seem
so much more pleasurable to you?

1319
01:25:53,292 --> 01:25:57,083
No-no-no-no...
I can't be free with myself...

1320
01:25:57,167 --> 01:25:58,625
in Mr. Weng's villa.

1321
01:25:58,708 --> 01:26:00,104
Is there another room?

1322
01:26:00,139 --> 01:26:01,500
No, we're overbooked...

1323
01:26:01,542 --> 01:26:03,542
Somewhere we can go or
we can be alone.

1324
01:26:04,917 --> 01:26:06,833
Please... Have me, take me...

1325
01:26:07,458 --> 01:26:09,292
Okay...
Come with me.

1326
01:26:16,417 --> 01:26:17,750
Kill the slots.

1327
01:26:31,792 --> 01:26:33,750
This is why we have soft openings...

1328
01:26:33,833 --> 01:26:35,250
so things like this
don't happen.

1329
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,292
- Get them fixed.
- Yes, sir!

1330
01:26:59,292 --> 01:27:02,500
Wow! Stunning.

1331
01:27:02,583 --> 01:27:05,042
What is? Me or the diamonds?

1332
01:27:05,458 --> 01:27:06,417
Both.

1333
01:27:06,458 --> 01:27:10,125
I think you're the most
honest man in this town.

1334
01:27:12,750 --> 01:27:14,500
And I don't think we're gonna need
the security cameras...

1335
01:27:14,542 --> 01:27:16,833
for this next part.

1336
01:27:17,667 --> 01:27:20,625
<i>Well... Not unless you wanna watch
the playback.</i>

1337
01:27:22,833 --> 01:27:23,958
<i>Now...</i>

1338
01:27:25,417 --> 01:27:28,000
I thought we agree with the turn off
of our phones.

1339
01:27:28,042 --> 01:27:31,375
I know, but that's Bank.
He's the only one that has that number.

1340
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,542
I can make you give that back to me.

1341
01:27:41,250 --> 01:27:42,458
I could try.

1342
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,583
Do you have any wine
back there?

1343
01:27:47,208 --> 01:27:49,250
I got everything you need
back there.

1344
01:27:55,542 --> 01:27:56,750
Chateau du Camp?

1345
01:27:58,333 --> 01:28:00,333
As long as it's not '73.

1346
01:28:28,250 --> 01:28:30,500
Send that to Bank's office.

1347
01:28:54,083 --> 01:28:55,125
Yeah?

1348
01:28:55,208 --> 01:28:56,208
<i>Cue the Cartwheel.</i>

1349
01:28:56,833 --> 01:28:57,708
You got it.

1350
01:28:57,750 --> 01:29:00,217
At least I was still happy, when
I saw her like on the magazine.

1351
01:29:00,292 --> 01:29:06,000
She's actually one person
like I really kill.

1352
01:29:07,917 --> 01:29:08,917
Hello?

1353
01:29:08,958 --> 01:29:10,007
Oh hey Saul.

1354
01:29:10,042 --> 01:29:14,625
I came out here originally for
a hotel manager at first school.

1355
01:29:15,083 --> 01:29:17,750
But... like...

1356
01:29:17,792 --> 01:29:20,375
I don't know.

1357
01:29:23,667 --> 01:29:24,917
Bunã...

1358
01:30:02,917 --> 01:30:04,375
I'm so sorry, sir.

1359
01:30:04,417 --> 01:30:05,792
I tried to stop him...

1360
01:30:05,875 --> 01:30:06,583
It's not your fault.

1361
01:30:06,625 --> 01:30:10,417
You can't stop a man that's jumping.

1362
01:30:10,452 --> 01:30:11,917
It's alright.

1363
01:30:11,958 --> 01:30:13,667
Yes.

1364
01:30:15,708 --> 01:30:16,708
Mr. Bank...

1365
01:30:17,750 --> 01:30:19,000
do you know what Chuck Berry...

1366
01:30:19,042 --> 01:30:22,000
said every night
before counting 1, 2, 3, 4?

1367
01:30:23,833 --> 01:30:24,875
What did he say?

1368
01:30:25,167 --> 01:30:26,083
Pay me my money.

1369
01:30:27,500 --> 01:30:29,125
Well, I'm sure my people...

1370
01:30:29,167 --> 01:30:30,333
In cash!

1371
01:30:30,458 --> 01:30:31,667
Cash?

1372
01:30:32,375 --> 01:30:34,250
You've already been wired the money.

1373
01:30:34,958 --> 01:30:37,208
Mr. Bank, this is, this is, this-this...

1374
01:30:37,667 --> 01:30:40,292
this is a Fender Roads moment.

1375
01:30:40,875 --> 01:30:42,667
You're in yet?

1376
01:30:42,708 --> 01:30:44,458
I hate that.

1377
01:30:54,458 --> 01:30:56,375
Mr. Bank, Mr. Bank, listen...
All do respect, all do respect, sir.

1378
01:30:57,083 --> 01:30:58,375
You got a job tomorrow.

1379
01:30:58,417 --> 01:30:59,667
Running this place.

1380
01:31:00,042 --> 01:31:01,958
You go to work
every day.

1381
01:31:02,083 --> 01:31:03,042
Yawn... Yawn...

1382
01:31:03,083 --> 01:31:06,333
I make one phone call, I get
Sean Wright, Travis Pestrana...

1383
01:31:06,375 --> 01:31:08,292
five of their buddies here
before midnight...

1384
01:31:08,542 --> 01:31:10,958
doing Heel Clickers and
Lazy Boys up a back...

1385
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,458
Ye-ye-ye... Yes.

1386
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:16,167
If your audience wants to see
a bunch of longhairs...

1387
01:31:16,202 --> 01:31:17,507
riding Rice Rides...

1388
01:31:17,542 --> 01:31:19,750
but I'm talking about
heavy bikes, sir.

1389
01:31:19,785 --> 01:31:21,250
This is heavy bike!

1390
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:25,458
I'm a goddamn American icon!

1391
01:31:29,542 --> 01:31:32,000
Don't change it that much.
Keep a little... Keep a structure.

1392
01:31:34,833 --> 01:31:36,458
You're a legend in 34 states.

1393
01:31:37,083 --> 01:31:38,625
And an animal
on the other 34.

1394
01:31:40,917 --> 01:31:42,000
24, 22.

1395
01:31:42,042 --> 01:31:46,458
This is a night people will talk
about as long as it's in Las Vegas.

1396
01:31:47,292 --> 01:31:48,750
And when we're talking about it...

1397
01:31:48,792 --> 01:31:51,833
we'll either be talking
about you or you won't.

1398
01:31:52,792 --> 01:31:54,500
Now, that's your choice.

1399
01:31:57,250 --> 01:31:59,167
Mr. Bank, can I just say
one more thing?

1400
01:32:06,250 --> 01:32:07,292
Are you gonna jump?

1401
01:32:07,375 --> 01:32:08,292
Jumping, baby!

1402
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:10,333
Thank you.

1403
01:32:11,792 --> 01:32:12,792
Yeah, I'm looking.

1404
01:32:17,917 --> 01:32:19,208
Alright, Rusty's out.

1405
01:32:19,917 --> 01:32:21,833
I gotta say I'm very at you.
Very nice job.

1406
01:32:22,167 --> 01:32:24,500
Yeah, I know I did. That's why
they asked me to do it, not you.

1407
01:32:26,833 --> 01:32:29,583
Well see, that is me offering you
an olive basket

1408
01:32:29,625 --> 01:32:31,750
and that's you spitting in my face.

1409
01:32:32,375 --> 01:32:33,667
Well is that your face?

1410
01:32:34,708 --> 01:32:36,083
Okay, where's Eugene's
trapdoor?

1411
01:32:36,417 --> 01:32:38,750
<i>Under the Dragon, first machine
on the left.</i>

1412
01:32:38,792 --> 01:32:40,042
Got it. What's the secret?

1413
01:32:40,083 --> 01:32:42,298
<i>Coin, 3 counts.
Coin, 6 counts.</i>

1414
01:32:42,333 --> 01:32:44,833
<i>3 Coins, 5 counts.
2 Coins half count.</i>

1415
01:32:44,875 --> 01:32:47,257
Could you make it anymore complicated?

1416
01:32:47,292 --> 01:32:50,208
<i>That's just the first sequence.
Then there's two bular.</i>

1417
01:32:50,250 --> 01:32:51,417
Right.

1418
01:33:59,333 --> 01:34:00,917
I think...

1419
01:34:01,292 --> 01:34:03,042
I think I've may have...

1420
01:34:03,333 --> 01:34:05,167
I got all three...
I got all three.

1421
01:34:05,750 --> 01:34:07,417
Oh my god...
Oh my god!

1422
01:34:07,708 --> 01:34:09,625
I'm a winner!

1423
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,750
Progressive slots win on
opening night?

1424
01:34:34,583 --> 01:34:37,125
Genuine shock,
genuine surprise...

1425
01:34:37,167 --> 01:34:39,750
pupil dilation,
elevated heartbeat...

1426
01:34:40,875 --> 01:34:41,875
it's legitimate.

1427
01:34:52,375 --> 01:34:53,833
- New dice.
- Coming in.

1428
01:34:54,125 --> 01:34:54,958
New dice.

1429
01:34:58,667 --> 01:34:59,750
New dice, coming in.

1430
01:36:17,125 --> 01:36:18,667
Ooh, what was that?

1431
01:36:19,792 --> 01:36:20,917
You felt it too?

1432
01:36:33,375 --> 01:36:34,292
You!

1433
01:36:35,125 --> 01:36:35,958
What a thrill.

1434
01:36:38,167 --> 01:36:39,833
it's still up.

1435
01:36:41,042 --> 01:36:42,167
Let's hit for playing.

1436
01:36:42,542 --> 01:36:44,792
Alright, ladies and gentlemen,
let's place your bets.

1437
01:36:45,125 --> 01:36:46,125
There can only be one winner.

1438
01:36:55,708 --> 01:36:56,833
Everything alright?

1439
01:36:57,167 --> 01:36:59,542
Are we okay?
Did that tremor throw off the system?

1440
01:36:59,583 --> 01:37:01,917
No, sir.
It would take more than that to knock her.

1441
01:37:01,958 --> 01:37:03,625
- Sir?
- Yeah.

1442
01:37:03,667 --> 01:37:05,708
I have a pit boss asking for an approval.

1443
01:37:05,743 --> 01:37:07,083
He can't reach Miss Sponder.

1444
01:37:07,833 --> 01:37:09,792
- What's the action?
- 10 million. Roulette.

1445
01:37:13,792 --> 01:37:16,542
- It's good.
- Okay.

1446
01:37:19,292 --> 01:37:23,542
Alright, gentleman's down at
three number combination: 11, 12 and 13.

1447
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,708
You get reception here,
that's impossible.

1448
01:37:33,542 --> 01:37:34,750
Not with this phone.

1449
01:37:35,667 --> 01:37:37,958
Yes, sir.
Hello? Bank here.

1450
01:37:38,958 --> 01:37:40,958
We're getting interference
on server 1.

1451
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:42,917
- Hello? - What kind?
- I don't know.

1452
01:37:43,542 --> 01:37:44,500
Hello?

1453
01:37:44,542 --> 01:37:45,958
Server 1 is gong down.

1454
01:37:46,083 --> 01:37:47,708
Oh, no.

1455
01:37:47,750 --> 01:37:49,333
Sir,

1456
01:37:49,375 --> 01:37:51,042
That's the only explanation.
Some kind of magnetron.

1457
01:37:51,375 --> 01:37:52,792
Server 3's starting to wobble.

1458
01:37:53,250 --> 01:37:55,083
A magnetron?
Who's got a magnetron?

1459
01:37:55,333 --> 01:37:56,833
Alright, everyone...

1460
01:37:56,917 --> 01:37:57,833
everyone in this room.

1461
01:37:58,125 --> 01:38:00,792
Everyone in this room,
empty your pockets!

1462
01:38:00,917 --> 01:38:01,917
Now!

1463
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,042
What's all going?
What does that mean?

1464
01:38:05,167 --> 01:38:06,042
Oh, no.

1465
01:38:06,083 --> 01:38:07,125
What the hell is this?

1466
01:38:07,542 --> 01:38:08,667
Security measures.

1467
01:38:09,042 --> 01:38:12,125
When the system sensors
a threat, it shuts down and reboots.

1468
01:38:17,208 --> 01:38:20,792
- Well, for how long?
- 3 minutes and 20 seconds.

1469
01:38:33,792 --> 01:38:35,458
Snake eyes.
All of them.

1470
01:38:42,917 --> 01:38:44,750
Oh, that son of a bitch.

1471
01:38:51,875 --> 01:38:53,917
We can't take anymore bets.
to a backup.

1472
01:38:54,375 --> 01:38:55,583
My system's in lockdown.

1473
01:38:55,667 --> 01:38:57,917
All calls in and out of
this room are secure...

1474
01:38:57,958 --> 01:39:00,125
unfortunately, it's the system
that's secure.

1475
01:39:00,667 --> 01:39:03,208
Again, sir.
It's in lockdown.

1476
01:39:06,583 --> 01:39:08,500
- Rebooting.
- And back up.

1477
01:39:08,917 --> 01:39:10,542
Three minutes and counting.

1478
01:41:28,125 --> 01:41:30,542
Come on 11!

1479
01:41:55,792 --> 01:41:58,542
Boys, I think our lucky streak
just ended.

1480
01:42:00,458 --> 01:42:01,792
Better cash them in boys.

1481
01:42:25,417 --> 01:42:26,417
Yes.

1482
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:33,292
Alright, guys, shut her down.

1483
01:42:34,250 --> 01:42:35,042
Shut her down!

1484
01:42:35,667 --> 01:42:37,292
She is shut down.

1485
01:42:37,375 --> 01:42:40,250
- No time for jokes, fellows.
- Does it sounds like I'm laughing?

1486
01:43:07,125 --> 01:43:10,750
Down the street safely. Safely.
Right this way everybody.

1487
01:43:11,500 --> 01:43:13,417
<i>Down the street safely, please.</i>

1488
01:43:14,917 --> 01:43:16,792
<i>Safely. Right this way.
Right this way everybody.</i>

1489
01:43:17,500 --> 01:43:18,750
<i>- Right this way.
- Jones!</i>

1490
01:43:18,792 --> 01:43:20,042
Jones!
What are you doing?

1491
01:43:20,375 --> 01:43:23,417
The earthquake's over!
They gotta get back! They gotta get back in.

1492
01:43:23,708 --> 01:43:26,333
Sir, it's the evacuation plan... I...

1493
01:43:30,667 --> 01:43:32,458
Well, it's all over now.

1494
01:43:32,792 --> 01:43:34,208
We can get back to us.

1495
01:43:36,333 --> 01:43:38,458
Feel my heart.
Let me feel it.

1496
01:43:38,500 --> 01:43:39,500
No.

1497
01:43:40,417 --> 01:43:41,458
Oh, no.

1498
01:43:41,583 --> 01:43:43,708
That's gonna stain.
Why don't we take these off.

1499
01:43:43,750 --> 01:43:44,667
- Off?
- Off.

1500
01:43:44,708 --> 01:43:47,375
- It's wet...
- Come on get them off.

1501
01:43:47,417 --> 01:43:48,417
- It's wet.
- Jos.

1502
01:43:48,458 --> 01:43:49,375
Oh, boy.
OK.

1503
01:43:49,417 --> 01:43:51,875
Hold it right there.
FBI!

1504
01:43:52,292 --> 01:43:53,333
Oh, dear god!

1505
01:43:55,125 --> 01:43:56,042
Robert?

1506
01:43:56,958 --> 01:44:00,625
This man, Lenny Pepperidge,
AKA Lenny the Pep...

1507
01:44:00,667 --> 01:44:04,292
AKA Shelden Wells,
AKA Little Timmy Hardwell...

1508
01:44:04,327 --> 01:44:05,500
is a confidence man.

1509
01:44:05,917 --> 01:44:07,708
Okay, that's-that's not the whole...

1510
01:44:07,750 --> 01:44:08,708
Help her up.

1511
01:44:08,750 --> 01:44:09,625
Oh, my god.

1512
01:44:09,667 --> 01:44:12,917
He infiltrates high establishments
through legitimate business contacts.

1513
01:44:14,042 --> 01:44:15,833
He was gonna drug you
and replace the real diamonds...

1514
01:44:15,875 --> 01:44:17,417
with these.

1515
01:44:18,750 --> 01:44:19,792
My god.

1516
01:44:19,833 --> 01:44:20,833
Oh, my god!

1517
01:44:21,208 --> 01:44:22,167
And that's not all...

1518
01:44:27,333 --> 01:44:28,333
Oh, my god.

1519
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,083
Oh, Abi, Abi okay...
I'm sorry...

1520
01:44:31,125 --> 01:44:31,965
I'm sorry.
I...

1521
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,542
- Oh, my...
- No, I really like you.

1522
01:44:33,583 --> 01:44:34,958
- Shut up.
- I really...

1523
01:44:36,167 --> 01:44:37,542
Oh, I am so finished.

1524
01:44:37,708 --> 01:44:38,542
Don't let it bother you.

1525
01:44:39,292 --> 01:44:40,333
I'm finished.

1526
01:44:40,542 --> 01:44:43,375
He's a professional at
a laying suspicion.

1527
01:44:43,417 --> 01:44:46,375
And seducing women
of a certain age.

1528
01:44:49,708 --> 01:44:52,250
You know, if Bank hears about this.
I am...

1529
01:44:52,625 --> 01:44:54,208
I'll be delicate in my report.

1530
01:44:54,500 --> 01:44:56,000
Get her statement.

1531
01:44:56,042 --> 01:44:57,625
Thank you, agent Caldwell.

1532
01:44:59,708 --> 01:45:00,958
I'll need your full name.

1533
01:45:15,292 --> 01:45:16,208
Thank you.

1534
01:45:17,708 --> 01:45:19,625
I'm just glad your mother
didn't have to see that.

1535
01:45:19,667 --> 01:45:21,500
You just don't wanna admit
that the Brody played.

1536
01:45:23,583 --> 01:45:25,375
It's a little early for
a victory lap.

1537
01:45:25,458 --> 01:45:27,958
<i>Linus, I hate to break this up
but did you make the switch?</i>

1538
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,500
<i>Yeah, yeah, everything went according to
plan, we're heading to the roof.</i>

1539
01:45:31,417 --> 01:45:33,792
- Did you hear that?
- I'm ready.

1540
01:45:38,417 --> 01:45:40,667
No, it's not that I'm just so desperate
to celebrate...

1541
01:45:40,708 --> 01:45:44,333
I need you to acknowledge that
it wasn't just a prop for prop's sake...

1542
01:45:44,375 --> 01:45:46,500
that the nose clay it worked.

1543
01:45:46,542 --> 01:45:48,625
That in a way it was kinda
perversly dignified...

1544
01:45:48,667 --> 01:45:51,375
Look, let's just finish the job.

1545
01:45:53,375 --> 01:45:54,167
There he is.

1546
01:46:17,833 --> 01:46:20,042
Oh, what the hell? What the hell?

1547
01:46:20,417 --> 01:46:21,667
Come on.

1548
01:46:22,500 --> 01:46:23,625
Give me the diamonds!

1549
01:46:25,208 --> 01:46:28,667
- Come on.
- Give him the diamonds.

1550
01:46:48,167 --> 01:46:49,208
A gun?

1551
01:47:20,792 --> 01:47:22,375
Come on! Let's go!

1552
01:47:40,417 --> 01:47:44,375
Rough night. Half a billion
running out the door.

1553
01:47:46,667 --> 01:47:48,208
You gonna roll over and die?

1554
01:47:52,375 --> 01:47:53,667
Do you think you hit me?

1555
01:47:58,333 --> 01:48:00,958
You aren't gonna know
where my soft targets are.

1556
01:48:03,458 --> 01:48:06,292
I'm still at a two handicap
on a golf course, you know.

1557
01:48:07,417 --> 01:48:11,583
I got the hottest new hotel on the Strip.

1558
01:48:12,625 --> 01:48:16,375
And I'm sure I've won a
Five Diamond Award.

1559
01:48:16,875 --> 01:48:18,583
- Yet again.
- Sure about that? - Sure.

1560
01:48:18,792 --> 01:48:20,750
- I got that baby...
- Soon enough.

1561
01:48:22,750 --> 01:48:25,542
Oh, whoops...

1562
01:48:42,875 --> 01:48:44,875
This town might have changed,
but not me.

1563
01:48:47,458 --> 01:48:48,500
I'm gonna let you down.

1564
01:48:51,875 --> 01:48:53,000
I know people.

1565
01:48:53,958 --> 01:48:56,833
Highly invested in my
survival...

1566
01:48:56,875 --> 01:49:00,375
and they are people who
really know how to hurt...

1567
01:49:00,708 --> 01:49:04,667
in ways you can't
even imagine.

1568
01:49:08,417 --> 01:49:09,417
Well...

1569
01:49:09,458 --> 01:49:11,458
First I know all the guys
that you'd hired...

1570
01:49:11,493 --> 01:49:13,167
to come after me...

1571
01:49:13,208 --> 01:49:14,875
they like me better
than you.

1572
01:49:24,125 --> 01:49:25,917
Second, we're not gonna
go to the cops.

1573
01:49:27,708 --> 01:49:29,500
Let's face it, you're not
gonna go to the cops.

1574
01:49:35,208 --> 01:49:36,375
Third...

1575
01:49:37,417 --> 01:49:38,875
you've shook Sinatra's hand.

1576
01:49:40,958 --> 01:49:42,625
You should know better, Willie.

1577
01:50:08,083 --> 01:50:09,208
My diamonds.

1578
01:50:31,208 --> 01:50:33,083
No, no, no!

1579
01:50:41,208 --> 01:50:43,292
Shit!

1580
01:50:54,625 --> 01:50:56,583
<i>This town...</i>

1581
01:50:58,042 --> 01:51:00,417
<i>is a lonely town</i>

1582
01:51:02,292 --> 01:51:04,708
<i>Not the only town...</i>

1583
01:51:06,667 --> 01:51:09,042
<i>like a this town</i>

1584
01:51:12,083 --> 01:51:13,958
<i>This town...</i>

1585
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,917
<i>is a make-you town</i>

1586
01:51:19,417 --> 01:51:22,875
<i>Or a break-you town...</i>

1587
01:51:22,917 --> 01:51:26,333
<i>and bring you downtown</i>

1588
01:51:35,208 --> 01:51:36,250
What's this?

1589
01:51:37,917 --> 01:51:40,708
That's just the deed to
4,6 acres of prime...

1590
01:51:40,750 --> 01:51:43,500
real estate in the north end
of the Strip.

1591
01:51:44,833 --> 01:51:48,583
The moment you become embarrassed
if who you are, you lose yourself.

1592
01:51:48,875 --> 01:51:51,917
I changed my house, the way I dress,
what I ate.

1593
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:53,875
For what?
For nothing.

1594
01:51:55,875 --> 01:51:57,167
There he is.

1595
01:51:58,875 --> 01:52:00,292
Thanks for those letters.

1596
01:52:02,958 --> 01:52:04,083
They brought me back.

1597
01:52:10,375 --> 01:52:11,917
You're more than welcome.

1598
01:52:30,750 --> 01:52:32,583
- Hi.
- Looking for Terry. It's Daniel.

1599
01:52:42,375 --> 01:52:43,542
- Danny.
- Terry.

1600
01:52:46,667 --> 01:52:48,750
That's what I do when
I see a blitz coming.

1601
01:52:48,785 --> 01:52:49,792
A blitz?

1602
01:52:49,875 --> 01:52:51,500
I guess Toulour just happened
to be on the roof.

1603
01:52:51,542 --> 01:52:54,292
at the exact moment that we were
coming out with the diamonds.

1604
01:52:55,333 --> 01:52:57,000
How did you know I'd go for them?

1605
01:52:57,042 --> 01:52:58,750
Because you're you
and I am me.

1606
01:52:59,292 --> 01:53:02,500
We were watching Toulour
while you had him watching us.

1607
01:53:07,458 --> 01:53:09,208
This is your in.

1608
01:53:09,292 --> 01:53:11,250
Which you donated
to charity.

1609
01:53:13,167 --> 01:53:13,958
Charity?

1610
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:15,417
Camp to Belong.

1611
01:53:15,583 --> 01:53:16,833
The kids are very greatful
they're gonna have you up to visit...

1612
01:53:16,868 --> 01:53:17,958
next month.

1613
01:53:26,375 --> 01:53:28,083
Now you know that wasn't
our deal.

1614
01:53:30,042 --> 01:53:31,583
Well if you feel that strongly
about it...

1615
01:53:31,667 --> 01:53:34,708
then we'll send the kids
back to their foster homes.

1616
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:37,333
All 200 of them.

1617
01:53:40,250 --> 01:53:44,333
- You think this is funny?
- Terry, it sure is shit ain't sad.

1618
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:54,208
<i>Why these children?</i>

1619
01:53:55,250 --> 01:53:59,458
<i>Well, I'm just very moved by
the kinda work they're doing there...</i>

1620
01:53:59,500 --> 01:54:01,125
<i>and you gotta start somewhere
and luckily you know...</i>

1621
01:54:01,208 --> 01:54:03,208
<i>the casino business is doing well...</i>

1622
01:54:04,125 --> 01:54:08,208
<i>and I hope there's more millions
to come for other organizations.</i>

1623
01:54:08,833 --> 01:54:12,542
<i>But, like I said... I was really
moved by that place...</i>

1624
01:54:12,917 --> 01:54:17,042
<i>You know, you gotta do
is look inside a child's eyes...</i>

1625
01:54:17,167 --> 01:54:18,375
<i>and... that's all it needs...</i>

1626
01:54:18,417 --> 01:54:20,833
<i>all the motivation
that one needs.</i>

1627
01:54:21,042 --> 01:54:23,167
<i>- Well, thank you for being an angel.
- No, thank you.</i>

1628
01:54:23,208 --> 01:54:25,375
<i>- I'm just following her lead...
- Thank you, Terry Benedict.</i>

1629
01:54:26,125 --> 01:54:27,167
<i>We'll be right back.</i>

1630
01:54:36,042 --> 01:54:39,500
Well, I gotta jump. My dad's working
a frame he's got a part for me in it.

1631
01:54:44,500 --> 01:54:46,042
- Congratulations.
- Nice goin'.

1632
01:54:54,917 --> 01:54:56,500
See you when I see you.

1633
01:55:08,125 --> 01:55:10,417
Sorry, I guess this is just
a Susan B. Anthony event again.

1634
01:55:16,625 --> 01:55:19,382
So...

1635
01:55:19,417 --> 01:55:21,125
See you when I see you.

1636
01:55:24,542 --> 01:55:25,458
Next time...

1637
01:55:26,417 --> 01:55:28,083
try keeping the weight off
in between.

1638
01:55:31,333 --> 01:55:33,292
Gotta settle down
have a couple of kids.

1639
01:55:42,958 --> 01:55:45,583
<i>We'll be calling standbys
in a few minutes soon.</i>

1640
01:55:45,625 --> 01:55:49,333
<i>Please... please...
I gotta get out of here.</i>

1641
01:55:49,958 --> 01:55:52,042
<i>Maybe you'll get lucky
this time.</i>

1642
01:56:10,500 --> 01:56:11,833
You dropped these.

1643
01:56:12,083 --> 01:56:13,250
Go ahead. I got a plane
to catch.

1644
01:56:13,750 --> 01:56:16,542
Actually, try this one.
It's been paying out.

1645
01:56:24,792 --> 01:56:26,875
I won! Look at this!

1646
01:56:27,500 --> 01:56:29,292
I won $11 million!

1647
01:56:29,500 --> 01:56:30,917
Can you believe it?

1648
01:56:31,042 --> 01:56:31,958
Look at that!

1649
01:56:32,083 --> 01:56:34,792
I won $11 million.
I can't believe it!
