1
00:02:37,551 --> 00:02:39,422
What are you doing?
Going behind my back,

2
00:02:39,622 --> 00:02:40,622
Telling people i'm screwing up this operation?

3
00:02:41,498 --> 00:02:45,140
I got you a suite at The fucking Plaza Hotel.
- The shittiest suite..

4
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,340
What?
- ..The shittiest fucking suite.

5
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,540
Based on what?
- The food is wrong...

6
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:51,582
And, What is this?
- You got like one of my closet or something.

7
00:02:51,782 --> 00:02:53,831
No.
- Are you dressing him, like you're dressing me?

8
00:02:54,031 --> 00:02:55,795
<i>No, what are you thinking?
This is not about you...</i>

9
00:02:55,995 --> 00:02:57,705
Are you trying to dress me so that,
I look like him?

10
00:02:57,905 --> 00:03:00,345
No, you're not dressed like him.
- I do look..I look like him. <i>- No.</i>

11
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,962
He's in like velvet...
- You asked me to show you, how this is done.

12
00:03:03,162 --> 00:03:06,275
You wanna fuck it up, be my guest.
- Look, i never laid a hand on her, Alright?

13
00:03:06,475 --> 00:03:07,475
Is that what, this is about?

14
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:10,460
<i>Technically, that's not true.</i>

15
00:03:11,082 --> 00:03:13,315
Look, we never had sex okay?
I just wouldn't do...

16
00:03:13,515 --> 00:03:15,296
What will I do...
I put my hand like this...

17
00:03:17,134 --> 00:03:18,405
Don't you fucking touch me.

18
00:03:18,605 --> 00:03:19,605
That, bothers me.

19
00:03:19,805 --> 00:03:21,374
Oh, it does?
- Oh, yeah.

20
00:03:21,574 --> 00:03:22,574
That bothers you?
- Yes.

21
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,173
You know, a lot of shit bothers me too.

22
00:03:24,373 --> 00:03:26,120
But, i was just trying to help you.
If I wanted to bother you.

23
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,196
If I really wanted to fucking bother you?

24
00:03:28,396 --> 00:03:30,026
This is what I'd do.

25
00:03:30,232 --> 00:03:32,481
If I try to bother..
That's what i would do.

26
00:03:33,843 --> 00:03:35,321
You shouldn't have done that.

27
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,153
How's that, you bothered now?

28
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:41,561
Alright, don't make a thing of it.

29
00:03:42,098 --> 00:03:44,444
You shouldn't have touched him.
He doesn't like that.

30
00:03:44,644 --> 00:03:48,960
Oh, my God! Fix his hair..Jesus Christ!
<i>- ..It takes some time, okay. It's not like just..</i>

31
00:03:51,309 --> 00:03:52,533
We gotta get in the other room.
Come on.

32
00:03:53,296 --> 00:03:55,902
The Mayor is in there.
- Yes, I know that.

33
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,631
So, you go to the beauty parlour?
Is that what you do?

34
00:04:06,075 --> 00:04:07,753
How does it look?

35
00:04:07,953 --> 00:04:09,296
Fine.

36
00:04:09,496 --> 00:04:11,503
Let's go.

37
00:04:40,305 --> 00:04:42,804
<b><font color=#3EBFE6>-: AMERICAN HUSTLE:-</font></b>

38
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:48,062
<font color=#E24D1B>Custom subtitle by</font>
<b><font color=#3EBFE6>-: D3xt3r:-</font></b>

39
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,163
<i>This is face to face..
Person to person...</i>

40
00:05:11,363 --> 00:05:12,834
<i>This is why..call me old fashion, but...</i>

41
00:05:16,663 --> 00:05:17,918
Hey, what?
Excuse me, excuse me.

42
00:05:18,556 --> 00:05:20,631
I'll handle that for The Mayor.

43
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:23,813
Well, th..it's for The Mayor.

44
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,898
It'd be a sign of disrespect to the Sheikh
If The Mayor didn't take it.

45
00:05:27,098 --> 00:05:28,098
This is for you Mayor.

46
00:05:29,031 --> 00:05:30,679
What're doing?
Carl... what the fuck? What is this?

47
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:33,637
I'll take care of it. Everything's good.
I got everything under control.

48
00:05:33,837 --> 00:05:35,078
Whoa..whoa! Hey... hey.

49
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,029
What is this?
- I don't know. I don't know.

50
00:05:39,331 --> 00:05:40,529
I don't know you.

51
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:43,256
I don't know what the fuck, that is.
But, it's weird. You understand?

52
00:05:44,061 --> 00:05:46,023
A misunderstanding.
Misunderstanding.

53
00:05:46,223 --> 00:05:48,878
Look, I came here to meet a Sheikh.
That's all i know.

54
00:05:49,078 --> 00:05:50,907
I'm very interested in that.
He's not here, apparently.

55
00:05:52,802 --> 00:05:55,301
I'm very interested in meeting The Sheikh.

56
00:05:55,302 --> 00:05:56,587
You let me know, when I get that.

57
00:05:56,787 --> 00:05:58,770
Thank you, have a good day!

58
00:05:59,334 --> 00:06:00,428
Richie,

59
00:06:01,053 --> 00:06:02,175
you better go and get him.

60
00:06:02,644 --> 00:06:04,169
Go out there and get him right now.

61
00:06:05,943 --> 00:06:09,813
I don't wanna do this in the first place.
This is your show...

62
00:06:10,297 --> 00:06:12,046
..you go get him.
- Look, you have no choice.

63
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:13,811
You have to go get him.
Now, go get him.

64
00:06:14,011 --> 00:06:15,965
So, he takes the briefcase by himself.

65
00:06:16,165 --> 00:06:17,165
That's the whole plan, Irving.

66
00:06:18,568 --> 00:06:21,067
What were you doing,
pushing the fucking briefcase, dummy?

67
00:06:21,068 --> 00:06:23,567
Huh?

68
00:06:23,568 --> 00:06:26,601
You know, how much this fucking cost?
With this goddamn hotel, that you fucking asked for.

69
00:06:26,801 --> 00:06:29,686
Now, I gotta go..mop up your mess.
I'm gonna go fucking mop up..

70
00:06:29,886 --> 00:06:30,886
...your mess!

71
00:06:38,105 --> 00:06:40,082
Do you understand that he had..
It was working until..

72
00:06:40,282 --> 00:06:42,157
He was upset about the Sheikh.

73
00:06:43,105 --> 00:06:45,643
Did you ever had to find a way,
to survive?

74
00:06:46,135 --> 00:06:48,639
And you know, your choices were bad.

75
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:49,839
I learned how to survive..

76
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,916
When I was a kid.

77
00:06:54,586 --> 00:06:57,345
My father, had a glass business.

78
00:06:57,545 --> 00:07:01,282
I would rather be on the taking side;
Then, the getting taken side,

79
00:07:01,482 --> 00:07:05,196
any day of the week.
Specially, after I saw my father get taken.

80
00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:08,925
I mean, seeing that.
Scarred me for life.

81
00:07:10,257 --> 00:07:13,319
I took it upon myself to..
Drum up business.

82
00:07:15,877 --> 00:07:18,821
I became a different kinda then my father.

83
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,931
I became a Con artist.
For real.

84
00:07:21,131 --> 00:07:22,368
From the feet up.

85
00:07:22,857 --> 00:07:23,959
I was gonna survive...

86
00:07:24,757 --> 00:07:26,046
..no matter what.

87
00:07:26,934 --> 00:07:29,433
I still had the glass business.

88
00:07:29,434 --> 00:07:31,933
And, a few dry cleaning stores also.

89
00:07:31,934 --> 00:07:34,433
And i did, some art dealing on the side.

90
00:07:35,714 --> 00:07:37,938
Stolen or forged art.

91
00:07:38,138 --> 00:07:40,955
I'm your host..enjoy. Enjoy!

92
00:07:41,465 --> 00:07:44,785
So, I go to this pool party and wham.

93
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:46,830
Meet my friends.

94
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:13,070
Is that Duke Ellington,
on your bracelet?

95
00:08:13,795 --> 00:08:17,051
Yeah, as a matter of fact..it is.
He died this year, you know?

96
00:08:17,251 --> 00:08:19,727
I know.
I doubt anyone else here,

97
00:08:19,927 --> 00:08:20,927
knows or cares about it.

98
00:08:20,964 --> 00:08:23,712
Well, i care about it.
He saved my life many times.

99
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,219
Mine too. Which one?

100
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,349
Jeep's Blues.-: D

101
00:08:31,549 --> 00:08:32,549
Jeep's Blues?

102
00:08:33,441 --> 00:08:35,799
Mmhmm.
Jeep's Blues.

103
00:08:39,225 --> 00:08:42,250
You wanna hear it?
- Right now?

104
00:08:42,686 --> 00:08:45,200
Yeah.
- Sure.

105
00:09:04,245 --> 00:09:05,685
Who starts a song like that?!

106
00:09:07,227 --> 00:09:08,225
It's magic.

107
00:09:11,598 --> 00:09:13,349
Magic.

108
00:09:16,141 --> 00:09:18,640
He wasn't necessary in good shape..

109
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:22,476
..And he has this calm over.
That was rather, elaborate.

110
00:09:24,938 --> 00:09:26,528
He had this air about him.

111
00:09:27,073 --> 00:09:30,234
And, he had this confidence
that drew me to him.

112
00:09:31,318 --> 00:09:32,985
He was, who he was.

113
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,136
He didn't care.

114
00:09:36,236 --> 00:09:40,522
I mean, she was a very particular person.

115
00:09:46,203 --> 00:09:49,889
Like me, she come from a place
where her options were limited.

116
00:09:57,396 --> 00:10:00,585
It actually can feel kind of sexy, sometimes.

117
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,527
There was a boldness in it.

118
00:10:06,232 --> 00:10:08,358
But, where would that boldness take me?

119
00:10:09,312 --> 00:10:10,689
I didn't know.

120
00:10:12,991 --> 00:10:15,486
But, I was gonna find out.

121
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,783
Like me, she learned to survive
and reinvent herself.

122
00:10:20,784 --> 00:10:24,570
She knew she had to reinvent her life
and her identity.

123
00:10:25,022 --> 00:10:26,569
Like me, she envisioned a better..

124
00:10:27,456 --> 00:10:29,014
..Elegant future for herself.

125
00:10:29,647 --> 00:10:32,581
Like me, she knew she had to have a vision.

126
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:34,906
She came to New York;

127
00:10:35,471 --> 00:10:37,970
She visioned it.
And, just like that...

128
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:41,278
She applied for a job.
At the Cosmopolitan Megazine.

129
00:10:41,478 --> 00:10:43,481
You're obviously here for a reason,
let's get to it.

130
00:10:43,874 --> 00:10:46,343
Our cover story right now
is on Cunnilingus.

131
00:10:46,543 --> 00:10:47,543
What do you think about that?

132
00:10:48,053 --> 00:10:49,592
I like it.

133
00:10:50,761 --> 00:10:54,062
Do you have any clerical skills?
Can you type?

134
00:10:54,262 --> 00:10:56,575
She loved the world.
But, she was stuck in this clerical..

135
00:10:56,576 --> 00:10:59,075
..Job that she was too smart for it.

136
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:02,284
She was a smart girl.
I never met anygirl like it.

137
00:11:03,553 --> 00:11:04,938
She knew her stuff.

138
00:11:09,732 --> 00:11:11,208
I was broke...

139
00:11:11,762 --> 00:11:12,792
fearless.

140
00:11:13,543 --> 00:11:18,855
Got nothing to loose.
And my dream, more than anything..

141
00:11:19,591 --> 00:11:24,490
Was to become anyone else;
other than who I was.

142
00:11:31,336 --> 00:11:33,106
He had a chain of Dry cleaning stores.

143
00:11:36,617 --> 00:11:39,559
I got two in the Bronx...
and uh..three in Manhattan.

144
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:40,759
Hey, Byron.

145
00:11:40,842 --> 00:11:43,341
How're you doing?
This is Sydney.

146
00:11:43,342 --> 00:11:45,841
He asked me, If I wanted
to come in and upgrade my wardrobe.

147
00:11:45,842 --> 00:11:48,341
He said he had a lot of nice things.

148
00:11:48,342 --> 00:11:51,045
That got left behind by people
then forgot over the years.

149
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,731
Hey, you wouldn't believe the shit
that people leave behind here.

150
00:11:54,931 --> 00:11:57,019
They're unbelievable.
- People leave stuff here?

151
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,840
Oh, yeah.
They got out for the night.

152
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,040
You know, they drink.

153
00:12:00,362 --> 00:12:01,435
Come in the morning..

154
00:12:02,272 --> 00:12:05,560
Put their clothes in and they forget.

155
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,154
Is that nice or not?

156
00:12:08,354 --> 00:12:11,343
Some of these almost had been for years.

157
00:12:11,543 --> 00:12:14,093
They are not picking it up.
Someone's to pick it up.

158
00:12:15,591 --> 00:12:17,576
Sydney, it's yours.

159
00:12:17,776 --> 00:12:18,776
You want it..it's yours.

160
00:12:22,225 --> 00:12:24,724
Whooo, I like it.

161
00:12:24,725 --> 00:12:29,035
You look fantastic!

162
00:12:32,295 --> 00:12:36,300
My God! I can only dream about it.
These dresses are beautiful.

163
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,379
This. No, it's beautiful.

164
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,879
Put it on, come on.

165
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,695
Look at that, Please?

166
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,399
Really?

167
00:12:56,305 --> 00:12:58,158
I felt like we had a secret.

168
00:12:58,358 --> 00:12:59,358
Just the two of us.

169
00:12:59,558 --> 00:13:01,307
You know, like that thing..
When you just wanna be with..

170
00:13:01,507 --> 00:13:02,507
The one person all the time.
And..

171
00:13:04,147 --> 00:13:07,822
You feel like just the two of you
understand that nobody else gets.

172
00:13:08,022 --> 00:13:09,368
I could just..

173
00:13:09,907 --> 00:13:12,358
Tell her everything about myself.

174
00:13:19,637 --> 00:13:23,447
And, I never had anybody like that,
in my life before.

175
00:13:23,526 --> 00:13:27,221
It felt like, finally...
I can truly be myself.

176
00:13:27,748 --> 00:13:31,941
Without being ashamed..
Without being embaressed.

177
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,131
What is this place?

178
00:13:36,331 --> 00:13:37,331
Do you sell lies here?

179
00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:40,971
Yeah, sometimes. It's my office.

180
00:13:41,171 --> 00:13:42,585
I know it's your office.
But..

181
00:13:43,067 --> 00:13:45,583
.. You have all these other places.
So, what's this for?

182
00:13:47,128 --> 00:13:48,359
Why did you bring me here?

183
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:52,356
This is getting to be my uh..
My main business.

184
00:13:52,556 --> 00:13:54,034
My going business.

185
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:58,611
I hold that loans to guys who can't get loans.

186
00:13:58,811 --> 00:13:59,811
You know, like their last resort.

187
00:14:00,011 --> 00:14:01,011
You're their last resort.

188
00:14:01,852 --> 00:14:04,463
Since, interest rates are north
to 12 % and heading to 18 %.

189
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:06,698
That's nice smarty pants.

190
00:14:07,381 --> 00:14:08,716
Fucking Jimmy Carter.

191
00:14:09,226 --> 00:14:10,425
Fucking Nixon really.

192
00:14:11,363 --> 00:14:13,303
The war and the defecit..
And all that shit..

193
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,503
I fucking love it,
you're so smart.

194
00:14:15,978 --> 00:14:16,877
You are.

195
00:14:17,573 --> 00:14:19,169
Thanks Kid. But, how do you
get them the money?

196
00:14:24,045 --> 00:14:26,558
Well...
- You don't..do you?

197
00:14:28,858 --> 00:14:29,815
You don't.

198
00:14:31,609 --> 00:14:34,877
Thes..these guys are lousy risks.
You know?

199
00:14:35,077 --> 00:14:38,156
I can't get them the loan.
But, i get my fee..five thousand.

200
00:14:38,356 --> 00:14:39,782
Five thousand?

201
00:14:40,469 --> 00:14:42,004
You take five thousand,
and you don't get them anything.

202
00:14:42,597 --> 00:14:46,098
These are bad guys, you know?
They get pair of divorces, gambling habits..

203
00:14:46,298 --> 00:14:48,497
Embezzling..and all that shit.

204
00:14:49,285 --> 00:14:51,773
Everybody at the bottom
crosses path eventually; In a..

205
00:14:52,215 --> 00:14:54,929
Pool of desperation and..

206
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:57,266
..You are waiting for them.

207
00:14:59,003 --> 00:14:59,923
How about we?

208
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,475
We?
- Mmhmm.

209
00:15:04,675 --> 00:15:05,675
How about it?

210
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:14,148
Sydney? Sydney, I'm sorry.
That was too much, i went too far.

211
00:15:14,348 --> 00:15:16,076
I didn't wanna upset you,
Sydney please, i'm sorry!

212
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,885
I know it ain't for everybody.

213
00:15:18,629 --> 00:15:22,395
Oh, God! I love getting to know you!

214
00:15:22,752 --> 00:15:24,581
Alright..why did you have to tell the truth?

215
00:15:25,295 --> 00:15:26,378
Telling the truth?

216
00:15:32,061 --> 00:15:34,954
Why did you do that for?
Why did you do that for?

217
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,070
I should've never tell the woman the truth.

218
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,270
But, she's so smart.
She is terrific.

219
00:15:43,121 --> 00:15:45,177
She is terrific.

220
00:15:45,435 --> 00:15:46,867
God!

221
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:54,880
You said, it was nice knowing me.

222
00:15:55,046 --> 00:15:56,580
You said, it was nice to meet me.

223
00:15:59,357 --> 00:16:00,464
- Yeah.

224
00:16:00,664 --> 00:16:02,264
Would you like..to meet.

225
00:16:03,241 --> 00:16:07,944
Lady Edith Greensley.

226
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:10,653
I have royal banking connections..

227
00:16:11,736 --> 00:16:12,662
In London.

228
00:16:14,119 --> 00:16:17,610
I'd love to help you with loans.
But, of course i have to be very...

229
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,317
Selective.

230
00:16:24,148 --> 00:16:26,061
That was fucking fantastic.

231
00:16:26,261 --> 00:16:29,678
Thank you. Did you like it?
- I liked it.

232
00:16:29,878 --> 00:16:30,878
Thank you for coming back.

233
00:16:32,327 --> 00:16:34,834
Thank God you came back.
- I wasn't going anywhere.

234
00:16:35,034 --> 00:16:37,855
I fucking love you.
- You have me.

235
00:16:38,055 --> 00:16:39,968
And, so... Irving and I began our partnership.

236
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:42,320
In love and commerce.

237
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,520
Rebecca..

238
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,720
Hold on.

239
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,920
You're Edith right?
- He told me to tell my friends..

240
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,804
I had London Banking connections.

241
00:16:49,004 --> 00:16:51,084
She told me, you'd get me a line of credit.

242
00:16:51,284 --> 00:16:53,059
I know you have banking connections
in London, England.

243
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:54,259
And, after that say 'No'.

244
00:16:54,459 --> 00:16:55,459
A lot.

245
00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:01,654
Until, the guy is hook.
- Listen, tell her. I've never missed a check.

246
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:05,720
It was almost scary,
how easy it is to take money from..

247
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,920
Desperate people.

248
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:09,509
Lady Edith Greensley.

249
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:12,009
It's so good to see you, Ken.
- Lady..Your Ladyship..

250
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:14,110
Thank you, again.
- These are the roles...

251
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,910
..that we were meant to play.
- We are very selective.

252
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:20,564
Without strong application.
We talked about it.

253
00:17:20,764 --> 00:17:21,764
I don't take a deal..

254
00:17:22,055 --> 00:17:24,554
That i can't close.
- You're not being aggressive enough.

255
00:17:24,555 --> 00:17:27,054
If you've ever been to great nick.

256
00:17:27,055 --> 00:17:29,405
Everybody knows my dealership.
<i>- Five thousand gets me fifty, right?</i>

257
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,619
Five grands get me fifty?

258
00:17:36,446 --> 00:17:40,317
I was doing so much more business with her.
We doubled..we tripled!

259
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,559
I've never met anyone,
Men or Women;

260
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,059
In business.
Who's so careful and precise about..

261
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,559
...everything!
Every stylishtic details.

262
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:49,759
Congratulations!
- We kept selling art together too.

263
00:17:53,165 --> 00:17:59,000
Its 'A Boy and His Dog'.
It's a non-religious painting.

264
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:05,131
Before we go any further.
Is this legit?

265
00:18:05,331 --> 00:18:07,619
Ah, let's just say..
You know it's missing from Spain.

266
00:18:07,819 --> 00:18:08,819
Let's leave at that.

267
00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:10,763
Don't show it to any Spanish friends.

268
00:18:15,435 --> 00:18:17,099
I mean, it just took off!

269
00:18:17,299 --> 00:18:18,299
We got a better office.

270
00:18:18,499 --> 00:18:19,499
We called it, London Associates.

271
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:27,768
When I was around her,
I felt 'joy'.

272
00:18:27,968 --> 00:18:28,968
Fucking Joy!

273
00:18:29,168 --> 00:18:30,168
And, love.

274
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,059
That's what i felt.

275
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:52,847
As..as far as I can see.

276
00:19:53,047 --> 00:19:55,813
People are always conning each other.
To get what they wanted.

277
00:19:56,013 --> 00:19:58,369
We even 'Con' ourselves.

278
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:00,869
We talk ourselves into things, you know.
We sell ourselves things..

279
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:03,369
Whether we do need or want.

280
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,869
You know, we are dressing 'em up.

281
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:08,650
We leave out the risk.
We leave out the ugly truth.

282
00:20:12,076 --> 00:20:13,660
Pay attention to that.

283
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:17,225
Cos, we are always conning ourselves
in one way or another.

284
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:19,440
Just to get through life.

285
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:24,950
<i>He was married and he had a son.</i>

286
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,810
Daddy!

287
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,860
<i>He had adopted her son.</i>

288
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:32,510
<i>He's a really good dad.</i>

289
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:34,690
<i>I respected him, for that.</i>

290
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:38,567
<i>It was a tough situation for everyone.</i>

291
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:41,494
What did you do today?

292
00:20:41,694 --> 00:20:44,269
That kid Donovan is being mean to me.

293
00:20:44,469 --> 00:20:45,469
That big kid?
But, he..

294
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:49,768
Mommy was picking you up.
So, he couldn't bother you.

295
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,959
She was late.

296
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,867
And then, after we put out the fire.
Mommy said,

297
00:20:55,067 --> 00:20:57,346
to stay in my
room with my baseball cards.

298
00:20:57,546 --> 00:21:02,952
What fire?
- Did you know they made a lamp that had the sun in it?

299
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,300
Mommy got the lamp.

300
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,580
She made a special drink
and the lamp made a fire.

301
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,510
I put out the fire.

302
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:15,197
The fire is out!

303
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,560
First time in my life, I do the right thing.
- Oh, shut up!

304
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:24,820
No, no..no.
Save, a young single mother..

305
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,020
..And a kid.

306
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:29,088
I married you. I adopt him.
- You fell in love.

307
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,674
Don't you dare forget that part.
We fell madly in love!

308
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:33,852
Yes, I fell in love.
My God, I fell... yes.

309
00:21:34,052 --> 00:21:36,766
But, you know I thought you were mysterious
like my mother. Until, it turned out..

310
00:21:36,966 --> 00:21:39,527
The mysterious just meant depressed.
Alright? Hard to reach.

311
00:21:39,727 --> 00:21:40,727
I mean, i'm dying here!

312
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:46,179
You're young..you're beautiful.
You gotta find somebody else you gotta..

313
00:21:46,379 --> 00:21:48,920
Go out and get some friends. Alright?
- I don't like going out.

314
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,534
You know that I get anxiety
when i get to meet people.

315
00:21:51,734 --> 00:21:52,734
You know how hard that is.

316
00:21:52,934 --> 00:21:56,336
You cannot just stay in the house,
with a fucking sunlamp!

317
00:21:56,536 --> 00:21:58,840
Alright? I can't..
I mean look...

318
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,784
I can't trust you with Danny.
When you're...

319
00:22:00,984 --> 00:22:01,984
the fire and everything.

320
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,859
I put the fire out Irving.
There's no fire...

321
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:08,008
Maybe, if you were here more. Then,
there wouldn't have been a fire in the first place.

322
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:10,189
There wouldn't have been a fire,
if i was here?

323
00:22:10,389 --> 00:22:13,029
Just stop with the whole fire thing!
God! It was a mistake.

324
00:22:13,229 --> 00:22:14,401
I'm sure million people do that.

325
00:22:14,601 --> 00:22:15,601
All the time.
Those sunlamps are dangerous.

326
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:18,671
I shouldn't have it in the house, really.

327
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,530
I bet that happens all the time.

328
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:23,766
This was nothing.

329
00:22:25,361 --> 00:22:27,505
We are not happy, alright?

330
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,348
You know that I could take Danny.

331
00:22:33,548 --> 00:22:34,548
You know that most your work is illegal.

332
00:22:34,748 --> 00:22:38,489
And, you know that if you try to divorce me;
you know that, i'm not saying that I would.

333
00:22:38,689 --> 00:22:39,689
But, i'm saying that I could.

334
00:22:39,889 --> 00:22:42,994
But, i'm saying that.
That is why, I don't like divorce Irving.

335
00:22:43,194 --> 00:22:44,194
Women do that in divorces.

336
00:22:44,394 --> 00:22:47,038
Women get the children
and the father never gets to see them.

337
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,842
My mother never got divorce.
My granmother never got divorce.

338
00:22:51,042 --> 00:22:52,042
There are no divorces in my family.

339
00:22:52,242 --> 00:22:53,992
I am not..getting a divorce.

340
00:22:54,192 --> 00:22:55,423
Come on, what are we doing here?

341
00:22:55,623 --> 00:22:57,570
We fight and we fuck.
And, that's what we do.

342
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:58,770
That's our thing!

343
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:01,531
She's the Picasso of
Passive agressive karate.

344
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:04,827
She was better than any con artist
they ever met.

345
00:23:05,027 --> 00:23:08,280
Including myself.
And, she had me like nobody had me.

346
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,486
Irving come the fuck up.
Come on.

347
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:15,080
You might say, she was my Karma.
For how i took advantage of people.

348
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,280
Oh, my God!
- Come here.

349
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:22,332
Come on, get in the bed.

350
00:23:22,532 --> 00:23:25,518
No, wait.
- Baby, there's such good stuff here.

351
00:23:25,718 --> 00:23:29,150
I did not wanna leave kid behind.
He's my son!

352
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,570
She had me.
I..was her mark.

353
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,673
Now, I can't assure you.

354
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:37,422
That your loan will be approved.

355
00:23:37,622 --> 00:23:40,567
But, I can tell you
that any deal I take..I close.

356
00:23:40,767 --> 00:23:43,740
However... my fee is not refundable.

357
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:44,940
Just like my time.

358
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:49,849
I wanna thank you very much.
Irving, for seeing me.

359
00:23:50,049 --> 00:23:51,049
Sorry, i'm so nervous.

360
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,253
Is that..am I not buttoned?

361
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,910
I just gotta say Mr.Rosenfeld
that Lady Edith was uh...

362
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:02,610
very... you're top notch and..

363
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:05,094
I really need your help.
I am desperate.

364
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:08,260
I mean, I got the house leashed
..and uh..

365
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,331
Two boats and..I forgot to mention,

366
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,770
that i have a little piece of real estate,

367
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:14,337
in Long Island.
- Hmm..you didn't mention that.

368
00:24:14,537 --> 00:24:16,325
Two lunch with you,
you never mentioned that.

369
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:19,845
Oh, I was gonna mention it.
Then, the guy with the hat walked in.

370
00:24:20,045 --> 00:24:23,040
The hat.
- You remember that? - I do.

371
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,710
That second time we had lunch.
- Yes.

372
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:29,849
We couldn't see his eyes.
Like he had no eyes.

373
00:24:30,049 --> 00:24:31,049
Did they sell hats like that?
- I don't know.

374
00:24:34,229 --> 00:24:36,926
Actually, i went down the store
and i thought the hat store down the street..

375
00:24:37,126 --> 00:24:38,996
I thought..
I was gonna get you one as like..

376
00:24:39,196 --> 00:24:40,907
It was like a momento.
- Two lunches?

377
00:24:41,107 --> 00:24:41,550
Yes.

378
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,066
Really?
- It's two lunches. What's the big deal?

379
00:24:44,266 --> 00:24:45,266
That's unusual.

380
00:24:45,466 --> 00:24:47,610
Just trying to get him,
to be more agressive.

381
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:50,025
On his loan, that is.
- You showed me whole new side of the city.

382
00:24:50,225 --> 00:24:51,225
I've never seen before.

383
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,653
You're welcome.
- No, thank you.

384
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,940
Yeah. Should I take Edith?

385
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,140
You'd like it.
- Yes.

386
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,920
So, I'll take you there twice.

387
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:01,670
Stop.

388
00:25:08,501 --> 00:25:10,789
You like this guy?
- Yes, I like this guy.

389
00:25:18,263 --> 00:25:19,888
Fine, you play your part.

390
00:25:20,088 --> 00:25:20,560
Take it to your people, in London.

391
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,250
Please.

392
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,560
Take it to them.

393
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,257
I got the cashier's check right here.

394
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,470
I give you five and you give me
fifty back, right?

395
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:32,670
Please.

396
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,130
Please, don't reject me.

397
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,370
Give a guy, a chance.

398
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:48,532
Zurich, you got office in Zurich?

399
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:52,290
Paris, I can call Paris?

400
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,290
Do whatever you need to do.

401
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,827
Go ahead, take your time.

402
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:00,740
Stick around for a little bit.

403
00:26:01,375 --> 00:26:03,874
See my friends over there?

404
00:26:03,875 --> 00:26:07,660
You got the wrong office.
You're gonna be embarrassed.

405
00:26:07,895 --> 00:26:09,532
Hey, hey..hey..hey!
Go easy on her.

406
00:26:09,732 --> 00:26:12,146
I may not have you Irving.
But, i have her on fraud.

407
00:26:12,346 --> 00:26:14,559
Impersonating another individual.
- On fraud..on fraud?

408
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,799
What is that? Identity fraud?
- You may be from England..

409
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,299
But you're not royal
and you have no banking connections.

410
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,783
That's a felony.

411
00:26:21,983 --> 00:26:23,460
How long is it?
That's three to five years.

412
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,881
Oh, really?
That's interesting.

413
00:26:26,081 --> 00:26:27,081
I don't even know your name.

414
00:26:27,281 --> 00:26:29,864
Richie DiMaso, F.B.I
Nice to meet you.

415
00:26:30,064 --> 00:26:33,026
You gotta keep away from this guy.

416
00:26:38,818 --> 00:26:40,778
He wouldn't let me see her, for three days.

417
00:26:40,978 --> 00:26:41,978
Even managed to delay a lawyer.

418
00:26:47,961 --> 00:26:49,672
She couldn't handle it.

419
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:55,750
Chuck, how come the fluorescence is on?
Can we kill that please?

420
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,306
Jesus Christ, i put this lamp here for you.

421
00:26:58,506 --> 00:27:00,345
Cos i thought it will be better for you.
This wires here...

422
00:27:00,545 --> 00:27:02,369
They're scared b'cos people hang themselves.

423
00:27:02,569 --> 00:27:03,569
But, i know..
You're too smart for that.

424
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,120
Where is the table and chair?

425
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,591
It's like a fucking asylum.
Joe, is everybody off today?

426
00:27:09,791 --> 00:27:10,791
Jesus Christ!
It's scary.

427
00:27:10,991 --> 00:27:12,611
Maybe, i wanted to scare you.
I don't know.

428
00:27:12,811 --> 00:27:13,811
Maybe, i'm little off..

429
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:17,353
The beaten path. You know?
I don't know, maybe.

430
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:19,602
You look dehydrated.
You wanna have some tea?

431
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,370
I know you think..look at me.
Hey,

432
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,880
Edith. I know you think
Irving loves you.

433
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,410
I know you thinking that uhm...

434
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,710
You think that he sees the world
as this...

435
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,060
a cold dark place.

436
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:49,477
He cares about nobody.
But, are very few people in the short list.

437
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,404
What if you are not?
What if you are not on that list?

438
00:27:56,604 --> 00:27:58,706
What if you're not on
that list, at all?

439
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,689
He'd be in here right now.
If he took the check. But, no you did.

440
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,857
God! It's so clear to me.
It's so crazy clear to me...

441
00:28:08,057 --> 00:28:10,008
But it's not clear to you.
He uses you, Edith.

442
00:28:10,208 --> 00:28:12,099
To protect himself.
To protect his son..

443
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:13,299
And his wife in long Island.

444
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,620
No? Yes!

445
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,390
He put a ring on her finger.
He adopted her son.

446
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:20,964
They have huge house,
they have two cars.

447
00:28:21,164 --> 00:28:22,929
What does she do all day?
I'll tell you what she does.

448
00:28:23,129 --> 00:28:25,496
She plays with her nail..
She watches T.V and she spends your money.

449
00:28:25,696 --> 00:28:27,263
The money that you make.

450
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:31,610
I don't like that you're in jail.
While he is going free.

451
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:34,605
I don't like any of that.
I wanna help you.

452
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:38,885
All the 'razzle-dazzle' that he does is not good.
It's not real. It's fake.

453
00:28:39,085 --> 00:28:40,703
It's not real.
Who you are is who you are.

454
00:28:40,903 --> 00:28:41,903
Between, you and God.

455
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,142
You and your soul.
That's what matters. That's what counts.

456
00:28:44,342 --> 00:28:45,342
That's what i'm about.

457
00:28:45,542 --> 00:28:46,542
That's what I see in you.

458
00:28:46,742 --> 00:28:48,654
Tell me, you didn't feel,
the first time we saw each other.

459
00:28:48,854 --> 00:28:50,469
Am I crazy?
I don't think so.

460
00:28:51,925 --> 00:28:55,072
I am not supposed to be talking about this.
I don't care. I'll break the rules.

461
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:58,675
Okay, Edith..Edith.
I wanna help you.

462
00:28:58,875 --> 00:28:59,875
I like you.

463
00:29:01,681 --> 00:29:03,448
<i>I like you.</i>

464
00:29:05,059 --> 00:29:06,483
I like you.

465
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,990
Been in here three days.

466
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:17,250
This doesn't look good for her.

467
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:26,080
How does it make you feel, her in there?

468
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,343
That check was for you, right?

469
00:29:29,543 --> 00:29:31,409
But, you knew something was off.

470
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,330
Because you're good.
You're like the best of the whole country,

471
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:36,530
Aren't you?

472
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:42,382
You know, if the country were run by
people like you, Irving Rosenfeld.

473
00:29:42,582 --> 00:29:44,881
We're gonna be up stringing like Guatemala.
You ever been to Guatemala?

474
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,599
If you ever tried to get a telephone or an apartment,
or anything in..

475
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,166
Guatemala.

476
00:29:49,366 --> 00:29:53,177
That's what this country would be like.
If we let people like you run this country.

477
00:29:53,377 --> 00:29:54,377
Who made you God and Judge?
Hmm.

478
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:58,299
My Aunt Gria lived to be 93 years old.
Never lied in her life.

479
00:29:58,499 --> 00:30:00,350
Congratulations!
- Thank you.

480
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,650
I'm proud of that too.

481
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:05,510
Except make you another good person.
Isn't that something to strive for?

482
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:06,710
Why are you breaking my balls, huh?

483
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,485
Get to the point.

484
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,152
I see something in you, Irving.

485
00:30:11,352 --> 00:30:13,707
I get very excited.
I think that we have a lot of potential here.

486
00:30:13,907 --> 00:30:14,850
Now, look?

487
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,470
I came up with the idea.
It's all for me. I wanna change things.

488
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,076
I wanna go after,
White collar crime.

489
00:30:21,276 --> 00:30:22,901
Irving, you're a very skilled man.

490
00:30:23,101 --> 00:30:24,101
And I want you to teach me;

491
00:30:24,301 --> 00:30:26,617
Hell, we can do this.
I want four people to do what you do.

492
00:30:26,817 --> 00:30:28,759
Fraudulent investments.
Fake certificates of deposits.

493
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,250
Stolen art..fake art.
You get me four people.

494
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:32,450
You're off the hook!

495
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:33,650
Four busts...

496
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,820
..And you will leave us alone?

497
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:37,610
We don't have to testify?

498
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:40,080
If you got it, you're done.
Anything you want.

499
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:44,848
But, if you run..then your life is over.

500
00:30:45,048 --> 00:30:46,270
You're gonna be hunted.
You're gonna be very difficult..

501
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:49,403
..For Rosalyn and the kid.
To live in this country.

502
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:51,906
We need to leave.

503
00:30:52,106 --> 00:30:53,106
We need to run and we need
to do it now.

504
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:58,060
Right, we'll go to Estonia or Romania;
I don't care.

505
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,210
We talked about it a hundred times!
- What about Danny?

506
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,060
What about Danny?

507
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,265
I adopted him.
I gave him my name.

508
00:31:04,465 --> 00:31:05,465
I'm not leaving him wih Rosalyn.
She's..

509
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:07,619
...unstable!
- That is a manipulation.

510
00:31:07,819 --> 00:31:08,819
Rosalyn will never let you go.

511
00:31:09,019 --> 00:31:12,551
She used Danny against you.
Because she's too messed up to let you leave.

512
00:31:14,191 --> 00:31:16,265
I can't leave him.
I love him, alright?

513
00:31:16,465 --> 00:31:18,755
He is my son.

514
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,353
Richie said, you will say that.

515
00:31:23,553 --> 00:31:24,553
Richie?
- Yeah.

516
00:31:24,753 --> 00:31:25,753
The cop?
- Yeah.

517
00:31:25,953 --> 00:31:27,618
You're on a first name basis, what?
- Yes, i am.

518
00:31:27,818 --> 00:31:28,818
I am not even on your list, am i?
- What list?

519
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,946
Your list. Your short list...
your long list.

520
00:31:31,146 --> 00:31:32,146
I'm not even on any of your fucking list.

521
00:31:33,029 --> 00:31:34,562
I thought that you love me.
- I love you.

522
00:31:34,762 --> 00:31:36,861
...that we have something.
- We do have something. It's perfect!

523
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,028
What are you saying?
We're gonna go to Romania.

524
00:31:39,228 --> 00:31:40,228
Is that what you're saying?
- Yes.

525
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,738
Yes, that's what I am saying.

526
00:31:41,938 --> 00:31:43,795
You..Me..Danny.
Yes.

527
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:46,246
Well, you never said that before.
- Well, i am saying it now.

528
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:48,645
We are us.
We can make it an adventure, like we did.

529
00:31:48,845 --> 00:31:50,720
We can make it an adventure,
like we make everything, alright?

530
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:52,250
Alright.
- Okay?

531
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:54,821
We have to go now, alright?
Trust me.

532
00:31:55,021 --> 00:31:56,021
We have to leave right now.

533
00:31:56,221 --> 00:31:57,221
I can't leave Danny, without custody.

534
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:00,070
- No, you have to take me away.
We have to leave.

535
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,819
No, what are you saying?
What are you saying?!

536
00:32:05,012 --> 00:32:06,555
Will you pull it together.

537
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:11,230
Don't say I don't love you.
That is bullshit.

538
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,810
This is bullshit.

539
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,720
WE..are bullshit.

540
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,750
You are bullshit.

541
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,218
You are bullshit.

542
00:32:22,418 --> 00:32:23,418
Please, don't do this.

543
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,460
I just never thought that
you're conning me.

544
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,550
I can never con you.

545
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:33,420
I love you.

546
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:37,650
Please don't say this.

547
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:45,870
No, I am done.

548
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:49,023
Don't say that.

549
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:53,644
I'm gonna do these four busts,
these four cons.

550
00:32:53,844 --> 00:32:56,240
To get us out of this.
Not just me, but us.

551
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,660
And, i'm gonna get really close..

552
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:02,526
With Richie. The Cop.

553
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,520
In case, we need to use him.

554
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,825
If we need another move.

555
00:33:07,025 --> 00:33:08,025
We won't need another move.

556
00:33:08,225 --> 00:33:09,225
We need four busts.

557
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,440
Then, we are done.

558
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:15,040
We are gonna need another move.
Trust me.

559
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:19,737
The key to people is what they believe.
And, what they want to believe.

560
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:22,172
So, I want to believe that we were real.

561
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:23,851
We are real.
- And, I want to believe,

562
00:33:24,051 --> 00:33:25,051
that a man could want me.

563
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,790
And, i'm gonna take all of that heartbreak.

564
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:29,080
And, all of that sorrow and
I am going to use it.

565
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:33,527
And, i'm going to make Richie think
that I want him...

566
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:34,930
..and that I like him.

567
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:40,144
And, I'm gonna be..
Very, very convincing!

568
00:33:43,985 --> 00:33:45,647
And, I am pissed at you.

569
00:33:45,847 --> 00:33:48,345
Cos, I am pissed at you!

570
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:52,435
Maybe, I do like him.

571
00:33:54,955 --> 00:33:57,225
Maybe, I like him a lot.

572
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,321
From the feet up, right?

573
00:34:04,521 --> 00:34:05,521
Baby?

574
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:14,143
Quit, bellyaching and come up
with something to get us out of this.

575
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:16,481
You're right, I am in no state
to deal with this.

576
00:34:16,681 --> 00:34:19,328
So, what's it gonna be Mr.Mastermind.

577
00:34:23,029 --> 00:34:24,446
An Arab Sheikh.

578
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:27,011
What do we want an Arab Sheikh, for?

579
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:28,560
What do you think this was, stupid?

580
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:32,350
If you could not call him Stupid.
Which he isn't.

581
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:33,550
He is smarter than you.

582
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:37,719
Last time i checked, he's in control;
and we work for him. Now, be nice.

583
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:45,300
To set this up.

584
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,240
To bust the Con artist.

585
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:51,835
We need to make the honey pot.
To attract the bees.

586
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,360
To attract the bees,
we need to offer them..

587
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:58,146
..Wealthy individual.
That they can take advantage of.

588
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,705
Someone special. Someone new...
someone amazing.

589
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,904
And, those guys that I wanna sell
fake bank sheets leads to that guy.

590
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,160
Thinks the Sheikh's money. You see?

591
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:09,782
Only, they can't get into his money.
Unless, they knew somone.

592
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:12,200
And, that someone is us.
- Oh, that's good!

593
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:16,545
So, if wanna get something like,
your con artist friend..that called Elway.

594
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,220
He keep him wanna buying.
- Keep your voice down.

595
00:35:24,405 --> 00:35:25,910
There you go. We can pinch him.

596
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,370
That's right.
But, I don't tell who is Sheikh.

597
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,740
I wait for him to call me.

598
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:31,620
The art world is a small world.

599
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:34,580
And one of Elway's acquaintance..

600
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:37,351
...is clocking us right now.

601
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:38,810
Where?
- Number one.

602
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:45,980
You have a good look?

603
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,720
How do you know the Sheikh?

604
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,440
This is my friend Dal, from Queens.

605
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:56,992
I do aluminium siding and roofing.

606
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,822
I wanna show you something.

607
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,472
People come from
all over the world to see this.

608
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,160
Yeah, he's good. Yeah.

609
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:09,110
It's a fake.

610
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:12,006
But..it's impossible.

611
00:36:12,206 --> 00:36:14,360
People believe, what they wanna believe.

612
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:16,330
The guy who made this,

613
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,840
was so good.

614
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:20,870
That it's real.
To everybody.

615
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:23,480
Now, who is the Master?

616
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:25,320
The Painter..

617
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,810
Or the Forger?

618
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,081
That's a fake?

619
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:30,990
This is the way,
the world works.

620
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:35,747
Not, black and white.
Like you were saying.

621
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:38,080
Extremely, grey.

622
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:43,540
Irving, could I?
- How many time I gotta tell you.

623
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:48,040
Not yet. Wait your turn.
- Arthur, Hi.

624
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,211
Edith.
- Edith, Hi.

625
00:36:50,411 --> 00:36:52,560
Yes, I wanted to introduce you
to Robert Spencer.

626
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,760
We are advising the Sheikh, together.

627
00:36:55,609 --> 00:36:57,993
Robert Spencer, advisor to the Sheikh. Yeah.

628
00:36:58,193 --> 00:36:59,360
What's this about, a goddamn Sheikh?

629
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:01,620
Why are you leaving me out of this?

630
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,228
Huh? I gotta hear it from my friends?

631
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:06,351
It ain't for you, Carl.
- What do you mean, it ain't for me?

632
00:37:06,551 --> 00:37:07,551
No, it ain't for you.

633
00:37:07,751 --> 00:37:09,825
We gotta do certificates of deposits.

634
00:37:10,025 --> 00:37:11,858
I can print as many as you need.
- I got my associates, it's the right guys.

635
00:37:12,058 --> 00:37:14,811
C'mon, this is not one man operation.
- Look, I can get other guys.

636
00:37:15,011 --> 00:37:16,906
What are you talking about, Irving?
- Are you telling me that...

637
00:37:17,106 --> 00:37:18,106
you can get four guys.

638
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:20,420
To sell, fake certificate of deposits.

639
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:24,760
To my investor, Within a week?
- Yes, I can make that happen.

640
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:27,290
Carl no way can do what he says,
he can do.

641
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:30,130
That's interesting.
But you know, other guys lined up;

642
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:31,770
I gotta meeting.

643
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:35,459
Carl, his associate says here..

644
00:37:35,659 --> 00:37:36,659
He's got a meeting, he has gotta go to.

645
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,556
I gotta run.
- Listen, don't go... don't go.

646
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,825
<i>The crazy thing about people,
The more you say 'no'..</i>

647
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:42,520
<i>The more they want in on something.</i>

648
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,130
<i>It is so stupid.</i>
- I gotta run!

649
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:47,960
C'mon, I'll tell him. Don't worry, I'll tell him.

650
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,160
Hey, you know what?
Carl just told me.

651
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:52,077
He said we could do this whole thing,
with four guys...

652
00:37:52,277 --> 00:37:53,642
..within a week.

653
00:37:53,842 --> 00:37:54,842
We could do something much bigger.

654
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,579
Something bigger? Yes, my guy deals
with hundreds of million of dollars.

655
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:00,079
How much bigger?
- Hundreds of million...

656
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,640
I knew you were holding out on me, Irving.

657
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:05,600
Like, i'm talking about
we can say never the fuck mind to see this.

658
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:07,670
And, we could have some complete access
to something huge!

659
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:11,535
Huge..like what?
Robert Spencer, I'm advisor to the Sheikh.

660
00:38:11,735 --> 00:38:12,735
Carl Elway.

661
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:15,470
I want you to think, the most under valued
asset in the state of New Jersey.

662
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:19,010
The rebuilding of Atlantic city.

663
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:24,992
Look, maybe they legalized gambling
a year ago..

664
00:38:25,192 --> 00:38:26,192
But nothing is happening.

665
00:38:26,392 --> 00:38:29,229
Hey, quit while you're ahead, Carl.

666
00:38:29,429 --> 00:38:31,466
I know the guy, the right people
that are gonna help you out.

667
00:38:31,666 --> 00:38:33,695
Who's the guy?
- The guy is Carmine Polito.

668
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:35,578
Who's Carmine Polito?

669
00:38:35,778 --> 00:38:36,778
Carmine Polito?

670
00:38:36,978 --> 00:38:39,445
Carmine Polito, No.

671
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:42,519
My boss started proceeded to tell me that,
Carmine Polito was..

672
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,230
The most quietly powerful person
in the state of New Jersey.

673
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:49,093
A lifetime native of the very
racially mixed Camden.

674
00:38:49,293 --> 00:38:50,293
Which had become a ghetto.

675
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,010
And, where he had been Mayor
for ten years.

676
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:54,150
A very beloved guy.

677
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,330
A guy, who never gave up for his people.

678
00:38:57,350 --> 00:39:00,990
His father had immigrated from Italy.
And, had stoked coal.

679
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:03,150
A BIG family guy with five kids.

680
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:08,147
They even adopted some other kid,
a black kid..from boys and girls club,

681
00:39:08,347 --> 00:39:09,347
from a Boston family.

682
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,960
I mean, his house hold was a Jewish place.

683
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,110
And, his wife Dolly..
Well she was the apple of his eye.

684
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,700
And, the centre of the household.

685
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:21,720
I mean everyone, love this guy.

686
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:25,360
And, he had a huge heart.

687
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:30,540
<i>The W.P.A employed craftsmen to paint this,
during the depression.</i>

688
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:33,300
Why can't we employ people, today?

689
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:36,060
<i>To do work like this,
and rebuilding Atlantic City?</i>

690
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,054
He worked with all the unions.
He was the leader of the state assembly.

691
00:39:40,254 --> 00:39:43,417
And, he just got gambling legalized in
New Jersey, to create jobs.

692
00:39:43,617 --> 00:39:46,850
But, he couldn't get the funds
to rebuilt Atlantic City.

693
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:48,210
And that, was his problem.

694
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,617
So, with out help..

695
00:39:50,817 --> 00:39:54,228
He was about to have his hand
in the wrong pocket, at the wrong time.

696
00:39:54,428 --> 00:39:56,160
And to me, that meant corrupt.

697
00:39:57,622 --> 00:39:59,173
You said, grifters..con artists..

698
00:39:59,373 --> 00:40:01,744
We are not going after
some politicians. This is..

699
00:40:01,944 --> 00:40:02,944
This is a bad idea, Richie.

700
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,490
Look, it's really simple.
All you need..

701
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,540
..Is to put two million.

702
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:09,357
In a Chase account.
- What?!

703
00:40:09,557 --> 00:40:10,557
Under the Sheikh's name.

704
00:40:10,757 --> 00:40:11,757
Whose, two million dollars?

705
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,200
Sh..just listen.

706
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,710
Two miliion dollars,

707
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,520
under the Sheikh's name..
In a Chase account.

708
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:18,740
That will be controlled.

709
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:20,740
Carmine,

710
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:24,320
calls up on the telephone,
calls the bank;

711
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:28,019
And, he sees that the Sheikh is real.
And he has a real account.

712
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:29,230
Five days.

713
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:33,145
I'm not taking 2 million dollars of the
tax payers money,

714
00:40:33,345 --> 00:40:34,345
putting it anywhere for five days.

715
00:40:34,545 --> 00:40:36,330
I don't care, if we control it the whole time.

716
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:39,360
Start let us do, what we need to do.
To rule out corruption.

717
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,620
And, to get rid of the pay-offs.
Guys that are ruining this country.

718
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,987
That's my dream.
Don't smirk, please.

719
00:40:45,187 --> 00:40:46,940
- You know, Richard
I understand your eagerness.

720
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,370
I really do.

721
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:50,504
You know, i'm from Michigan right?

722
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:51,757
Let me tell you a story.

723
00:40:51,957 --> 00:40:54,067
About me and my dad, my brother.

724
00:40:54,267 --> 00:40:56,055
We used to go, ice fishing every November.

725
00:40:56,255 --> 00:40:58,700
Ice fishing..that's all anybody..
That's what we live for.

726
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:59,900
Just listen to me!

727
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:01,669
It's beautiful!
We had a little stove,

728
00:41:01,869 --> 00:41:04,141
You huddle around.
We keep each other warm.

729
00:41:04,341 --> 00:41:06,731
You drop a line..
And you just wait.

730
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:08,760
One year, my brother says..
Let's go on october.

731
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:12,480
He wants to go ice fishing in October.
My Dad says, 'no, the ice is too thin'.

732
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,839
My brother says, I love my brother...
- I understand what that was..

733
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,339
Is that your brother went out on the ice,
the ice was too thin. He fell through the ice.

734
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:20,774
Went into the water,
b'cos he was too eager. Just like i'm too eager.

735
00:41:20,974 --> 00:41:21,974
Is that what you're saying?
- No, i'm not saying.

736
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,330
What are you saying?

737
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:27,118
You know, we'll finish the ice story
another time, young man.

738
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:28,860
For now, no Carmine Polito.

739
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:31,390
Go do your job.

740
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:34,974
Staunton shot the whole thing down.
- Boring.

741
00:41:35,174 --> 00:41:37,012
But, Edith was a genius.

742
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,200
She somehow, found this woman.
Who controlled the wire room.

743
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:45,830
A woman, I had never even heard of.

744
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,150
Way back, in the dorm buried
in the bureau.

745
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,200
This cat lady no one even talk to.

746
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:56,050
And, Edith met her in the ladies room.

747
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:58,630
Yeah, became friends with her.

748
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:02,450
Hi, how are you?
- This lady handles all the wires.

749
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:04,300
And now, she was working with us.

750
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:08,378
She was excited, to be included in the operation.
Instead of just...

751
00:42:08,578 --> 00:42:10,461
..being on the other end of a memo.

752
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:11,784
It was beautiful.

753
00:42:11,984 --> 00:42:13,395
This is from England?
- Yeah.

754
00:42:13,595 --> 00:42:14,595
Oh, I brought you some tea as well.

755
00:42:14,795 --> 00:42:15,795
Oh, thank you so much!

756
00:42:15,995 --> 00:42:18,241
Nobody ever talks to me.
- I know.

757
00:42:18,441 --> 00:42:22,278
They just say, <i>' Brenda, do the clerical wiring
stuffs and don't ask questions'.</i>

758
00:42:22,478 --> 00:42:23,478
You need to tell Richie about your cats.

759
00:42:23,678 --> 00:42:25,913
He loves cats.
- My Cats?!

760
00:42:26,113 --> 00:42:28,458
Well, that's Perry.
Look at him, standin up.

761
00:42:28,658 --> 00:42:29,658
Isn't that sweet?!

762
00:42:29,858 --> 00:42:31,909
And, that's Wendy,
she's a rascal.

763
00:42:32,109 --> 00:42:34,225
But, Bernaby..that's another story.

764
00:42:34,425 --> 00:42:35,425
Bernaby plays the piano.

765
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,270
That's impressive.

766
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:41,971
We got her to wire, 2 million dollars
to an FBI controlled account at Chase.

767
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:43,440
It'd be there for five days.

768
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:46,550
And, if Polito called?
He would see that the Sheikh was real.

769
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,368
And, by the time he Stauton
caught up to us.

770
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,099
Edith made sure, his boss
was impressed by my idea.

771
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:54,212
So, before he even knew it was happening.

772
00:42:54,412 --> 00:42:56,417
His boss was calling to congratulate him.

773
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,204
Anthony Amado.

774
00:43:00,404 --> 00:43:02,791
He had a major hard on,
for to make a name for himself.

775
00:43:02,991 --> 00:43:03,991
I mean, this guys love the idea
of being famous.

776
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:08,629
And, Stauton had to say
it was all his own idea.

777
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:10,476
Or he'd look stupid,
in front of his boss.

778
00:43:10,676 --> 00:43:12,319
You made me accept, praise from my boss,

779
00:43:12,519 --> 00:43:15,038
thanking me, for something
that never should have happened.

780
00:43:15,238 --> 00:43:17,453
Something that I didn't approve.
- You should be happy.

781
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:19,160
There's an imaginative things
happening in this office.

782
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:21,640
Alright, we're not just working in a box.

783
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,650
We got the two million to
put Carmine and the Sheikh together.

784
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:28,920
I like being on the side of the line.

785
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:30,960
But, someone had been left out.

786
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:32,900
We succeed because,
we stayed small.

787
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:34,720
You took on Elwey,

788
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,680
you both still went on.

789
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:40,509
So, if we max this.
That's enough.

790
00:43:40,709 --> 00:43:41,709
It's three one, no politicians.

791
00:43:43,350 --> 00:43:44,471
You're gonna do this, because..

792
00:43:44,671 --> 00:43:45,671
.. You got no choice.
You work for me.

793
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:47,980
Now, you keep changing the rules.

794
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:50,356
Now, you're getting a... little
power drunk.

795
00:43:50,556 --> 00:43:52,814
Richard, now you wanna tell me.
You wanna wake him up?

796
00:43:53,014 --> 00:43:55,346
Oh, no. I said, we shouldn't do any of it.
Irving, you know I said that.

797
00:43:55,546 --> 00:43:56,546
So, now I support Richie.

798
00:43:56,746 --> 00:43:58,877
He's got vision.
Do it heavy, or don't do it.

799
00:43:59,077 --> 00:44:01,651
I mean, he's the one ruining America,
not me.

800
00:44:01,851 --> 00:44:03,535
How the fuck am I ruining America?

801
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:06,609
Because, people just got over
Wategate and Vietnam, alright?

802
00:44:06,809 --> 00:44:08,635
You're gonna shit all over
politicians again?

803
00:44:08,835 --> 00:44:11,139
Is it because you wanna be a big shot,
and get a promotion?

804
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:12,815
No, I'm thinking big.

805
00:44:13,015 --> 00:44:14,015
Alright, this is gonna be fantastic.

806
00:44:14,215 --> 00:44:15,215
We're doing video surveillance.

807
00:44:15,415 --> 00:44:17,261
I'm doing this,
from the feet up!

808
00:44:17,461 --> 00:44:18,723
You will never do it properly.

809
00:44:18,923 --> 00:44:20,352
Because, you got too much
government attitude,

810
00:44:20,552 --> 00:44:21,552
to be small and sleek.

811
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:24,105
I'm like the fucking the A con-man, alright?

812
00:44:24,305 --> 00:44:25,305
I'm in and i'm out.

813
00:44:25,505 --> 00:44:26,505
I was there the whole time.

814
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:27,705
You don't know it, alright?

815
00:44:27,905 --> 00:44:28,905
That's, the fucking art.

816
00:44:29,105 --> 00:44:32,389
To become somebody,
who people can't pin and the police..

817
00:44:32,589 --> 00:44:34,282
Dreams on.

818
00:44:34,482 --> 00:44:35,482
You can't do it.

819
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:38,178
How about the suite at the Sheraton Hotel?

820
00:44:38,378 --> 00:44:41,014
For Carmine Polito and rebuilding, Atlantic City?

821
00:44:41,214 --> 00:44:42,214
Why not?
- We need a luxury for the Sheikh.

822
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:45,392
Oh, Come on! Carmine is used to dealing
back door all the time.

823
00:44:45,592 --> 00:44:47,383
We don't have a budget for that, Irving.

824
00:44:47,583 --> 00:44:48,583
We are gonna knock..

825
00:44:48,783 --> 00:44:51,798
The Mayor..
The speaker of the state assembly.

826
00:44:51,998 --> 00:44:54,130
You gotta knock him off
his fucking feet. Alright?

827
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:55,330
He's gotta feel like he is out of his league.

828
00:44:56,170 --> 00:44:58,580
What you're offering this deal,
I mean, this is unheard of.

829
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,680
In the state of New Jersey.
Maybe, in the whole fucking country alright?

830
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:06,540
Hey Sheikh, you're loaning us million
of dollars to rebuild Atlantic City.

831
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:09,149
Are you fucking kidding me?
That's gigantic, alright.

832
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:11,649
The mayor, he's gonna want to see the cash.

833
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:14,558
He's gonna want to see an account.
He's gonna want to see it right now...

834
00:45:14,758 --> 00:45:15,758
And, he will check.

835
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:17,871
That's why, this meeting isn't happening.

836
00:45:18,071 --> 00:45:19,071
Because, to get millions...

837
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:20,810
..you need millions.

838
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:26,921
We already did it.

839
00:45:27,121 --> 00:45:28,768
What?

840
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,469
We got the Bureau to park
two million dollars for three days.

841
00:45:32,669 --> 00:45:33,669
We got the account numbers.

842
00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:36,930
WE, meaning you and him?

843
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:40,800
Yeah, me and that guy.

844
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:44,010
She showed me.
- Show him, our thing?

845
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:46,550
You did that without me?

846
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:47,750
Are you kidding?

847
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:49,280
What are you gonna do?

848
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:04,680
You're playing me?

849
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,290
Or you're doing this,
you're playing him.

850
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,624
____

851
00:46:11,824 --> 00:46:13,172
You're gonna have to decide
for yourself, kid.

852
00:46:13,372 --> 00:46:14,372
I just laid everything
on the table.

853
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:21,470
This is all very exciting.

854
00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:28,001
I didn't know I could be like this.

855
00:46:32,882 --> 00:46:34,164
To be wild.

856
00:46:36,890 --> 00:46:39,527
You know we're taking down
bad guys.

857
00:46:40,833 --> 00:46:43,544
A very important politician.

858
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:31,220
This is agent, Richie Dimaso.

859
00:47:31,770 --> 00:47:34,010
I'm placing 75 thousand dollars
in this briefcase,

860
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:37,154
for Mayor Carmine Polito.
To procure..

861
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:40,278
Casino lisence and building permits
for Atlantic City.

862
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:53,748
<i>I don't know what that is.
This is very weird.</i>

863
00:47:53,948 --> 00:47:56,217
<i>This is very weird.
I don't know what the fuck that is.</i>

864
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:02,200
Mr.Mayor?!

865
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:03,947
Please, stop listen.

866
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:05,980
I apoligize, if that punk offended you.

867
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:07,180
I really apologize.
- I'm alright. Thank you.

868
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,728
No, i'm fucking embarassed
to be associated with that guy at all.

869
00:48:10,928 --> 00:48:11,928
Can i just say, something to you please.

870
00:48:13,110 --> 00:48:16,481
Don't loose this opportunity,
to fucking Florida. Alright?

871
00:48:16,681 --> 00:48:17,681
Just because of some...

872
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:19,570
Bullshit,

873
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:23,656
from that punk advisor.
With his diploma, alright.

874
00:48:23,856 --> 00:48:26,117
Who could never get into
the school that we come from.

875
00:48:26,317 --> 00:48:27,490
Don't loose that opportunity.

876
00:48:30,246 --> 00:48:31,910
Where are you from?
- From the Bronx.

877
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,540
Way on dock house
164th street.

878
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:40,620
I got lot of friends
who lives up there.

879
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:43,639
Yeah, got Tomasso running..

880
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:46,139
Tomassos on Arthur avenue?
- Yeah, the clams there...

881
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:48,639
Clams..oh, those are fucking to die
for, those things.

882
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,720
I haven't been there in a while.
I like that place.

883
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:53,190
Well, you know what..

884
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:55,440
Can I call you Carmine?

885
00:48:56,370 --> 00:48:57,570
You know, Carmine...

886
00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:00,100
Hey, my fucking heart is done..

887
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:02,574
Running down...
i'm not used to running.

888
00:49:02,774 --> 00:49:03,774
It's a lot of green grass..

889
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:07,479
In that hotel room. Up there.
Alright?

890
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:09,833
And, all the deals
will flow through you.

891
00:49:10,033 --> 00:49:11,746
You'll get a serious piece
on both ends, alright?

892
00:49:11,946 --> 00:49:12,946
You do with that
what you will, man.

893
00:49:13,530 --> 00:49:15,538
I live in the real world. Alright?
I'm a family man,

894
00:49:15,738 --> 00:49:17,179
I got mouths to feed and
everything like that.

895
00:49:17,379 --> 00:49:18,379
But, you know... this..

896
00:49:19,895 --> 00:49:21,699
You gotta grease it directly.

897
00:49:21,899 --> 00:49:23,737
No middle man, no bullshit.
It's the Arab's way.

898
00:49:23,937 --> 00:49:24,937
That's it..that's it.

899
00:49:25,137 --> 00:49:26,137
Alrigh, look I understand.

900
00:49:26,575 --> 00:49:28,070
It's a great opportunity,
you understand...

901
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:31,773
I was a little thrown by
going into meeting with somebody,

902
00:49:31,973 --> 00:49:32,973
I didn't even know would be in there.

903
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:36,425
I was thrown as well.
- Understand, I'll deal with you directly.

904
00:49:37,185 --> 00:49:39,001
Not any middle man or
any other bullshit.

905
00:49:39,201 --> 00:49:40,201
Done!
- I'll deal with you directly.

906
00:49:40,401 --> 00:49:41,401
I like you.
Eye to eye.

907
00:49:41,601 --> 00:49:43,841
We can do business together.
- That's fine.

908
00:49:44,450 --> 00:49:45,660
How long have you known this guy?

909
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,779
You've work with this guy, before?
- I gotta work with him. It's the Sheikh.

910
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:50,979
Alright
- But, I still need to meet the Sheikh.

911
00:49:51,179 --> 00:49:52,179
Okay?
- Done. After you.

912
00:49:52,890 --> 00:49:55,664
I'm going out for dinnner,
with Carmine and the wives in Camden.

913
00:49:55,864 --> 00:49:56,864
Who?

914
00:49:57,064 --> 00:49:58,064
Carmine and myself with the wives.

915
00:49:58,710 --> 00:50:00,043
What? Without me?!

916
00:50:00,243 --> 00:50:01,243
- He doesn't like you.
What do you want from me?

917
00:50:01,443 --> 00:50:03,607
I got him to come back,
take the money.

918
00:50:03,807 --> 00:50:04,807
You got him on tape.

919
00:50:05,007 --> 00:50:06,805
I can't make him like you.

920
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:08,729
I did my job.

921
00:50:08,929 --> 00:50:11,723
Did you tell him you're working with me.
And, that i'm the Sheikh's associate.

922
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:15,022
I just fucking told you!
He doesn't like you.

923
00:50:15,222 --> 00:50:17,048
I mean, let him have a nigh out with a human being.
For fucks sake.

924
00:50:17,248 --> 00:50:18,248
Alright? He is going to jail soon.
You're done with him.

925
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:20,759
You got him on tape, taking a bribe.

926
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:23,020
Carmine has got to deal with me, Irving.

927
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:25,567
We're gonna use Carmine.
Yeah, no..no, no.

928
00:50:25,767 --> 00:50:27,627
Carmine will get us other people.

929
00:50:27,970 --> 00:50:29,600
What? Like who?

930
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,405
Carmine is gonna use the Sheikh's
to pay off people.

931
00:50:32,605 --> 00:50:33,605
Are you fucking nuts?
Are you...

932
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,765
We're gonna let Carmine,
show the Sheikh Atlantic City.

933
00:50:36,965 --> 00:50:39,242
How he's gonna renovate hotels
and see who shows up!

934
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:42,376
Whoever the Sheikh pays off.
For lisences and casinos...

935
00:50:42,576 --> 00:50:43,576
That's who, we're gonna go after.

936
00:50:43,776 --> 00:50:44,776
We are gonna go after all of them!

937
00:50:44,976 --> 00:50:46,839
No more politicians?
- Yeah.

938
00:50:47,039 --> 00:50:49,091
You realize how fucking dangerous that is?

939
00:50:49,291 --> 00:50:50,291
There's no fucking
reasoning with you.

940
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:52,819
Alright, Edith and I
were so sucessful for so long..

941
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:55,319
Because, we kept it just
small enough.

942
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:58,252
You're taking us to a very
fucking dangerous place,

943
00:50:58,452 --> 00:51:00,286
with very serious numbers!

944
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:04,257
If you're that sucessful,
how come you wound up with me. Right now?

945
00:51:04,457 --> 00:51:05,910
Taking orders from me.

946
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:10,030
You're taking your wife out to dinner?
Your fucking wife, did i hear you correctly?

947
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,100
That's the one thing you heard me say?

948
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:14,670
I just find it rather shocking, that's all.

949
00:51:15,290 --> 00:51:18,251
I get to handle two wives,
with one dinner. Alright?

950
00:51:18,451 --> 00:51:20,803
I take Rosalyn out,
she keeps her mouth shut..

951
00:51:21,003 --> 00:51:22,570
She sees that my work is legitimate.

952
00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:23,770
I get to keep my kid and
I get to keep...

953
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:27,271
..that fucking wife happy.
Both wives happy.

954
00:51:40,050 --> 00:51:41,740
Richard, what are you doing?

955
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:46,248
Richard don't eat in the bathroom.
I told you so many times!

956
00:51:46,448 --> 00:51:50,239
And I have brought Napoleans.
Come out of the bathroom and pray.

957
00:51:51,070 --> 00:51:53,569
Oh, my god! What did you do?
- Richard,

958
00:51:53,570 --> 00:51:56,069
The filter is broken in the fishtank.

959
00:51:56,070 --> 00:51:58,870
It's the problem.
- See, my job is to do the ground.

960
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,630
When you don't do the filter right,

961
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:02,240
You get all the fish die.

962
00:52:03,130 --> 00:52:07,000
See?
- I can't that top of the thing...

963
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:08,986
And, please help Richard,

964
00:52:09,186 --> 00:52:11,466
to marry Diane so that
i may have granchildren,

965
00:52:11,666 --> 00:52:12,666
And, the Pope may have more followers.

966
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,970
And, please bless this food.
That we are about to eat.

967
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,340
Richard?
- Yea, hello?

968
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:21,875
Hi.
<i>- Who's this?</i>

969
00:52:22,075 --> 00:52:22,910
It's Edith.

970
00:52:23,570 --> 00:52:26,510
Sit down and pray properly.
- Are you alright?

971
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:28,670
Yeah, yeah I'm fine.
It's just..

972
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,539
..I'm alone, you know?
Irving is out with..

973
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:33,809
.. Carmine.
Oh, yes that's right.

974
00:52:34,009 --> 00:52:36,868
He went out with Carmine
and his wife...

975
00:52:37,068 --> 00:52:38,913
Yeah, you must not feel
so good about that.

976
00:52:39,113 --> 00:52:40,113
<i>Richar sit down.</i>

977
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:41,270
Wait, who is there?
Who are you with?

978
00:52:41,770 --> 00:52:46,086
Oh, no. It's just people.
- People...? I'm your fiance, Richard?

979
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:48,756
Oh, you got a fiance.
You are engaged.

980
00:52:48,956 --> 00:52:50,220
I don't know. I don't
have a fiance.

981
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:52,020
You don't know?

982
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:54,398
You don't know,
if you have a fiance.

983
00:52:54,598 --> 00:52:55,598
I don't, no.

984
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:58,110
Hmm, interesting.

985
00:52:58,580 --> 00:52:59,760
You wanna get together?

986
00:53:00,570 --> 00:53:02,734
Richard, Do something about the fishtank!

987
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:05,140
54th street?

988
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:06,340
Okay, 54th street.

989
00:53:06,930 --> 00:53:08,130
Okay, great.

990
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:11,770
That's what the phone call is about.

991
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:15,392
Everybody thought, "Oh, Richie DiMaso is
gonna stay in the office,

992
00:53:15,592 --> 00:53:17,740
pushing papers."
That's not gonna happen, Mom.

993
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:18,940
I'm outside on the field.
I got peoples working for me.

994
00:53:20,050 --> 00:53:24,895
My ideas, I'm running the show.
I'm the quaterback and i'm not gonna settle

995
00:53:25,095 --> 00:53:26,095
for no one, Mom.

996
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:51,609
Rocco, how are you?

997
00:53:51,610 --> 00:53:55,253
Rocco, we like the..
Chicken very thin, alright.

998
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:59,207
Look, the way you dresses the chicken..

999
00:53:59,407 --> 00:54:01,704
With the red sauce.

1000
00:54:01,705 --> 00:54:03,918
They're so good.

1001
00:54:04,982 --> 00:54:06,143
Here it is! This is it.

1002
00:54:06,455 --> 00:54:08,954
This right here, this right here.
Look at this.

1003
00:54:08,955 --> 00:54:12,990
This is so..good. So good.

1004
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:15,055
This is so nice.

1005
00:54:19,892 --> 00:54:21,573
Thank you, Rocco.
- Thank you, Rocco.

1006
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:24,380
I believe that, you should treat people;

1007
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:26,893
The way that, you want to be treated.

1008
00:54:27,093 --> 00:54:29,384
Did Jesus say that, or something?
- He may have.

1009
00:54:29,584 --> 00:54:30,584
I think also,

1010
00:54:30,784 --> 00:54:34,029
<i>Always take a favour, over money.</i>

1011
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:36,202
I think, Jesus said that as well.

1012
00:54:36,402 --> 00:54:37,977
I don't know if he said the second one.

1013
00:54:38,177 --> 00:54:39,177
He might have said the first one.

1014
00:54:39,377 --> 00:54:41,973
I chipped this moving furniture.
It's my new obsession.

1015
00:54:42,173 --> 00:54:45,800
Moving, redecorating..
Makes me feel better.

1016
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Like, exercise. But, there is this...

1017
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:49,819
There is this top coat.
That you can only get from Switzerland.

1018
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:52,490
And, I don't know what i'm gonna do.
B'cos, i'm running out of it.

1019
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:54,819
But, i love the smell of it.
- Oh, I can get it for you.

1020
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:56,654
That would be amazing.
- Of course!

1021
00:54:56,854 --> 00:54:57,854
There is something... the top coat.

1022
00:54:58,430 --> 00:55:01,854
It's like, perfumy.
But, there is also something rotten?

1023
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:03,771
And, i know that sounds crazy.

1024
00:55:03,971 --> 00:55:05,973
But, I can't get enough of it.
Smell it, it's true.

1025
00:55:06,173 --> 00:55:07,951
Dolly, historically..

1026
00:55:08,151 --> 00:55:11,416
The best perfumes in the world.
They're all laced with something nasty.

1027
00:55:11,616 --> 00:55:12,616
It is true!

1028
00:55:12,816 --> 00:55:14,867
Irving loves them.

1029
00:55:15,067 --> 00:55:16,067
He can't get enough of that smell.

1030
00:55:18,113 --> 00:55:19,386
I can't get enough.

1031
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:21,691
Carmine.
- Carmine, smell the nails.

1032
00:55:21,891 --> 00:55:22,891
Sweet and sour.
- Smell the nails.

1033
00:55:23,091 --> 00:55:24,091
Rotten and delicious.

1034
00:55:24,291 --> 00:55:26,594
It smells like flowers.

1035
00:55:26,794 --> 00:55:27,794
Flowers, but with garbage.

1036
00:55:32,070 --> 00:55:33,942
You know what that is for me.
It's coriander for me.

1037
00:55:36,052 --> 00:55:37,521
That's what hooks him.

1038
00:55:37,721 --> 00:55:38,721
He always comes back for it.

1039
00:55:46,190 --> 00:55:48,689
He's gonna say..
He is gonna say,

1040
00:55:48,690 --> 00:55:51,189
'We have to talk business'.
In Five...

1041
00:55:51,190 --> 00:55:54,815
four, three, two...
One.

1042
00:55:55,470 --> 00:55:58,125
Dolly, Can me and Carmine talk
about business here?

1043
00:56:13,417 --> 00:56:14,934
I'm not this drunk.

1044
00:56:25,709 --> 00:56:27,893
Didn't your fiance
want to come out tonight?

1045
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:29,093
Yeah, uh..

1046
00:56:31,034 --> 00:56:32,610
I don't know. Yeah..
No.

1047
00:56:32,810 --> 00:56:33,810
I don't know.

1048
00:56:36,748 --> 00:56:37,858
Oh, God..i'm sorry.

1049
00:56:38,058 --> 00:56:39,464
I'm sorry.
We don't have to talk about it.

1050
00:56:39,664 --> 00:56:42,027
I was just teasing you..
- That's alright.

1051
00:56:42,227 --> 00:56:43,605
Ever think like, ' How did I end up here?'

1052
00:56:43,805 --> 00:56:46,626
Like, how my life become
screwed? Ever think of that?

1053
00:56:48,705 --> 00:56:50,050
And, you wonder like...

1054
00:56:52,707 --> 00:56:55,097
Can I ever gonna get up to a better place.
Or, this is it.

1055
00:56:57,355 --> 00:56:59,130
You feel like that?
- Yeah.

1056
00:57:00,864 --> 00:57:02,250
Yeah, I do.

1057
00:57:02,790 --> 00:57:05,190
I definitely, know that.

1058
00:57:05,695 --> 00:57:08,251
I'm sorry, we don't have to go dancing.
We can go have coffee..

1059
00:57:08,451 --> 00:57:09,451
Or talk..or just..
- No, no..no.

1060
00:57:10,585 --> 00:57:11,745
No, no. I need this.

1061
00:57:13,999 --> 00:57:16,021
Please, I need to go
dancing with you.

1062
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:18,005
Please.

1063
00:57:20,285 --> 00:57:21,935
Okay baby,
Let's go dancing.

1064
00:58:33,015 --> 00:58:34,620
<i>Hurry up and get out of this.</i>

1065
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:35,820
I really fucking like you.

1066
00:58:36,870 --> 00:58:40,495
Yeah..yeah.
I like you too.

1067
00:58:41,235 --> 00:58:42,360
I wanna live.

1068
00:58:44,302 --> 00:58:45,462
Like, for real.

1069
00:58:45,662 --> 00:58:48,512
No more fake shit.
Right?

1070
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:53,477
We're gonna wait until we
decide, we fall for real.

1071
00:58:53,677 --> 00:58:56,126
That's when we fuck.

1072
00:58:56,326 --> 00:58:57,240
Not till then.

1073
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:58,440
Okay?

1074
00:58:59,165 --> 00:59:00,439
Okay.

1075
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:06,641
No more fake shit.
- No more fake shit.

1076
00:59:06,841 --> 00:59:08,607
No more fake shit.

1077
00:59:08,807 --> 00:59:11,021
No..more..fake, shit!

1078
00:59:23,770 --> 00:59:24,990
Get out.

1079
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:26,190
Get out.

1080
01:00:26,275 --> 01:00:27,404
Boys..

1081
01:00:27,604 --> 01:00:28,604
This guy right here, Julius?

1082
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,240
This guy,

1083
01:00:30,650 --> 01:00:32,400
Irving Rosenfeld.
You know what he's gonna do?

1084
01:00:32,890 --> 01:00:35,740
He is gonna bring the Sheikh to Atlantic City.
That's what he's gonna do.

1085
01:00:36,990 --> 01:00:40,360
Where we can build all those resorts,
there. Put everybody back to work.

1086
01:00:41,050 --> 01:00:43,870
He's gonna get this community;
He's gonna get this state.

1087
01:00:44,430 --> 01:00:45,980
Back on it's feet.
To where it belongs.

1088
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:48,090
Isn't that right?

1089
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:49,840
He's gonna grow our tax base,

1090
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:53,950
And, create thousands and
thousands of jobs, for everyone!

1091
01:00:54,290 --> 01:00:55,823
Do you understand that?

1092
01:00:56,023 --> 01:00:57,023
You know what that means?

1093
01:00:57,223 --> 01:00:58,223
To Irving!

1094
01:00:58,423 --> 01:00:59,423
To Irving!

1095
01:00:59,430 --> 01:01:03,680
Come on, this guy right here.
He's got a big heart.

1096
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:07,506
Let's just say, that
it didn't work out?

1097
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:08,930
What do you mean?

1098
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:11,550
Of course, it's gonna work out.
Guys like you and me...

1099
01:01:13,810 --> 01:01:17,004
right? We dream and we build.

1100
01:01:17,204 --> 01:01:18,204
We never give up.

1101
01:01:18,404 --> 01:01:21,106
We never quit.

1102
01:01:24,390 --> 01:01:25,430
Hey, can i ask you a question?

1103
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:28,530
Yeah, sure.

1104
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:30,050
Is the Sheikh black?

1105
01:01:32,590 --> 01:01:34,120
The Sheikh, he is uh...
He is an Arab.

1106
01:01:37,350 --> 01:01:39,040
That's black isn't it.

1107
01:01:43,590 --> 01:01:44,910
I know it's just
a dumb question but...

1108
01:01:45,830 --> 01:01:47,050
I was wondering..

1109
01:01:47,930 --> 01:01:49,410
Why are you asking?

1110
01:01:50,050 --> 01:01:51,370
I would like to,
arrange..

1111
01:01:52,030 --> 01:01:53,080
The Sheikh..

1112
01:01:53,650 --> 01:01:54,730
To see Camden.

1113
01:01:55,380 --> 01:02:00,940
To see the people of Camden.

1114
01:02:02,610 --> 01:02:04,730
Irv, i really want him to see.

1115
01:02:06,330 --> 01:02:08,370
How good this is going to be
for the community.

1116
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:11,280
How ready we are for
this opportunity.

1117
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:13,680
And, he could see how far
his dollar would go.

1118
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:15,810
You know what i mean.
What do you think?

1119
01:02:17,350 --> 01:02:19,950
Yeah, we can do that, yeah.

1120
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:22,980
Ah, good.

1121
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:25,880
Oh, hey..I got something..
I wanna give you.

1122
01:02:26,290 --> 01:02:28,060
Come on,
I got you a gift.

1123
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:30,292
Let's get out of here.

1124
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:33,899
The wive's gonna kill us.

1125
01:02:39,430 --> 01:02:42,330
Here you go.

1126
01:02:43,550 --> 01:02:44,500
What is it?

1127
01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:46,308
It's a Microwave.

1128
01:02:46,508 --> 01:02:47,508
It heats up everything.

1129
01:02:47,708 --> 01:02:48,708
Pasta, Lasagna..meatballs.

1130
01:02:48,908 --> 01:02:49,908
Whatever.
- Really?

1131
01:02:49,930 --> 01:02:52,202
It's science. Yeah,
it's that how it heats up the food.

1132
01:02:52,402 --> 01:02:53,402
It's scientific.
- And, you specifically, bought this

1133
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:59,277
science oven..for me?

1134
01:02:59,477 --> 01:03:00,477
Yeah.

1135
01:03:02,690 --> 01:03:03,860
A new friend.

1136
01:03:07,610 --> 01:03:08,690
Thank you.

1137
01:03:09,550 --> 01:03:11,088
Thank you.

1138
01:03:13,984 --> 01:03:14,884
Don't put metal it.

1139
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:16,630
Come on, let's get out of here.

1140
01:03:17,110 --> 01:03:18,842
I need a Jet at Tithe bora.

1141
01:03:19,430 --> 01:03:22,823
I need a Jet at Tithe bora, for the Sheikh.
- You don't..you don't need a Jet.

1142
01:03:23,023 --> 01:03:24,023
Let him walk to the curb at JFK.

1143
01:03:24,850 --> 01:03:26,264
That's not how it works.

1144
01:03:26,464 --> 01:03:27,464
You gotta start from the feet up.

1145
01:03:28,330 --> 01:03:30,007
That doesn't mean anything.
What does that mean?

1146
01:03:30,207 --> 01:03:31,207
It means you gotta be committed.

1147
01:03:31,407 --> 01:03:32,407
Means, you gotta be committed
to something in your life.

1148
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:33,607
For Christ sake, alright?

1149
01:03:33,807 --> 01:03:36,453
I want a Jet at Tithe bora,
for the Sheikh.

1150
01:03:36,653 --> 01:03:38,535
It can be a small jet,
Doesn't even have to take off.

1151
01:03:38,735 --> 01:03:40,887
Cos, i know you're so worried about
the money the bureau's gonna fucking spend.

1152
01:03:41,087 --> 01:03:43,416
It can take off and land
on the tarmac, okay?!

1153
01:03:45,020 --> 01:03:46,906
Alright, you can have the jet
for an hour.

1154
01:03:47,106 --> 01:03:49,371
But, takes off and lands at Tithe Bora.
- I got the jet?

1155
01:03:49,571 --> 01:03:50,571
You got the jet..
- Alright, thank you.

1156
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:54,110
Wait, tell me the rest of
the ice fishing story.

1157
01:03:55,630 --> 01:03:56,730
Where was I?

1158
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:59,450
Your father walks in the blizzard
at the lake..come on. C'mon!

1159
01:04:01,810 --> 01:04:03,130
Okay, when my brother and I
were on the ice..

1160
01:04:04,450 --> 01:04:06,470
..And my father came out of the house;
and I could see him coming.

1161
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:10,260
Holding the lantern and there's blizzard,
and i knew he was gonna be angry.

1162
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:12,530
So, i went to intercept my father.

1163
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,148
B'cos I knew if he saw
what my brother was doing,

1164
01:04:15,348 --> 01:04:17,883
He was gonna kill him.
- Oh, you tried to protect your brother,

1165
01:04:18,083 --> 01:04:19,520
But, you couldn't.
And that's why you feel bad, b'cos..

1166
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:21,205
You're trying to protect me
and you're worried about me.

1167
01:04:21,405 --> 01:04:22,405
Is that what the story is about?
It's about protection.

1168
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:24,940
No, it's not about protection.
<i>- No?</i> - No.

1169
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:27,305
Alright, fine.

1170
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:32,506
'Don't put metal in that science oven,
Roselyn...'

1171
01:04:43,330 --> 01:04:45,692
Another fire!
- NO, Danny! Not that one.

1172
01:04:45,892 --> 01:04:47,892
That one's empty.
We gotta get the big one.

1173
01:04:48,092 --> 01:04:50,374
I told you not to put metal
in the science oven.

1174
01:04:50,375 --> 01:04:52,924
What did you do that for?
- Don't make such a big deal.

1175
01:04:53,124 --> 01:04:54,124
Just get another one.

1176
01:04:54,180 --> 01:04:56,756
I don't want another one.
I want the one Carmine gave me.

1177
01:04:56,956 --> 01:04:59,336
Oh, Carmine..<i>I want the one Carmine
gave me.</i>

1178
01:04:59,536 --> 01:05:01,779
Carmine, carmine.
Why don't you just marry Carmine.

1179
01:05:02,119 --> 01:05:04,355
Get a little gold microwave
and put it on chain around your neck.

1180
01:05:04,555 --> 01:05:05,841
You wanna be more like Carmine?

1181
01:05:06,041 --> 01:05:08,074
Why don't you build something,
like he does.

1182
01:05:08,274 --> 01:05:09,664
Instead of your empty deals.

1183
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:10,864
They're just like your fucking science oven.

1184
01:05:11,064 --> 01:05:14,297
You know, I read that
it takes all of nutritions out of our food.

1185
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:17,342
It's empty, just like your deals.
Empty, empty!

1186
01:05:17,542 --> 01:05:18,542
That's bullshit.
- It's not bullshit.

1187
01:05:19,870 --> 01:05:21,470
I read it in an article.
Look..

1188
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:23,650
By Pulver Deur.

1189
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:26,609
Bringing something into this house,

1190
01:05:26,809 --> 01:05:29,665
That's gonna take all nutritions out
of our food and light our house on fire?

1191
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:32,753
Thank God, for me.

1192
01:06:00,730 --> 01:06:02,293
Alright, you got this.

1193
01:06:08,380 --> 01:06:11,750
I don't think,
you should come to Carmine's party, tonight.

1194
01:06:12,940 --> 01:06:15,024
You look beautiful.
By the way.

1195
01:06:16,615 --> 01:06:18,327
Don't look at me.

1196
01:06:18,527 --> 01:06:19,527
Alright?

1197
01:06:19,727 --> 01:06:20,727
Don't look at my legs,
don't look at my head.

1198
01:06:20,927 --> 01:06:21,927
Don't smell my hair.

1199
01:06:22,127 --> 01:06:23,127
Don't ask me how I am.

1200
01:06:23,327 --> 01:06:25,935
Don't talk to me outside
of this rules cos, i'm done.

1201
01:06:26,135 --> 01:06:28,295
Just stand still.
Get in the umbrella. Come on.

1202
01:06:28,770 --> 01:06:31,020
Just..Carmine wants
Rosalyn..

1203
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:33,687
.. To come.
- I don't care!

1204
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:36,689
You aren't listening.
I don't care if Rosalyn comes.

1205
01:06:36,690 --> 01:06:38,763
Just do your job, okay?

1206
01:06:38,963 --> 01:06:42,283
You're nothing to me,
Until you're everything.

1207
01:06:42,483 --> 01:06:45,617
I'm not Rosalyn,
I'm not gonna put up with that shit.

1208
01:06:53,223 --> 01:06:54,792
That's a fucking jet, right?

1209
01:06:54,992 --> 01:06:57,626
It's good.
- It's the kinda moves you need to make.

1210
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:00,992
Paco Hernandez?
I'm Richie DiMasso.

1211
01:07:01,192 --> 01:07:02,192
It's nice to meet you in person.

1212
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:06,040
This is Irving Rosenfeld.
- Paco Hernandez, nice to meet you.

1213
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:08,690
Paco..wait no, no.
He's not an Arab.

1214
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:11,946
No, Mexican, from Tucson.

1215
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:13,670
Where is my guy?
Where's Al?

1216
01:07:13,870 --> 01:07:15,834
My friend from Queens.
Where is he?

1217
01:07:16,034 --> 01:07:17,460
What are you doing?
- I gotta hire an FBI guy.

1218
01:07:18,220 --> 01:07:20,664
You speak any Arabic?
- Yeah, <i>As-salamu alaykum.</i>

1219
01:07:20,864 --> 01:07:23,191
That's it?
- No, i have a couple of phrases.

1220
01:07:23,490 --> 01:07:26,151
From feet up, you motherfucker.
What are you doing? C'mon.

1221
01:07:26,351 --> 01:07:28,222
Act normal, that's it.
Just seem all like...

1222
01:07:28,422 --> 01:07:30,560
You can't barely understand english.
You can't speak it.

1223
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:31,760
You say as little as possible,
you follow my lead.

1224
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:32,960
Alright?

1225
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:35,113
Who's running this?
I thought you're running this.

1226
01:07:35,313 --> 01:07:36,313
I am running this.
We gotta listen to him.

1227
01:07:36,513 --> 01:07:37,513
He's the guy with the vision.

1228
01:07:37,713 --> 01:07:39,508
I got the vision?
You know the vision I had?

1229
01:07:39,708 --> 01:07:40,708
You just kissed my girl.
Right outside.

1230
01:07:40,908 --> 01:07:42,943
That's what vision I have.
- I thought you guys broke up.

1231
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:44,700
I'm giving you a compliment.

1232
01:07:45,490 --> 01:07:46,630
What's going on?

1233
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:48,947
Don't worry about it, alright?

1234
01:07:49,147 --> 01:07:51,170
I got a knife.
This is for the mayor.

1235
01:07:51,370 --> 01:07:53,691
You gotta present it, to the mayor.
Just look at me.

1236
01:07:53,891 --> 01:07:55,330
Alright, look me in the eye.

1237
01:07:55,910 --> 01:08:00,085
This means a lot to you.
Right? That knife, play it.

1238
01:08:00,285 --> 01:08:01,285
You present it, alright?

1239
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:04,306
Friendship for life..alright.
You gotta feel it.

1240
01:08:04,506 --> 01:08:06,829
Sacred. Can you do it?
- Sacred.

1241
01:08:06,830 --> 01:08:08,924
Sell it.
- If you believe it, sacred.

1242
01:08:09,124 --> 01:08:11,537
They are sacred, alright?
- Listen, the details. That's what makes..

1243
01:08:11,830 --> 01:08:14,520
...This guy a genius.
- Again? You're complimenting me again.

1244
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:16,494
Rubbing salt in the wound?

1245
01:08:16,694 --> 01:08:17,694
What are you?
- I'm complimenting you.

1246
01:08:20,670 --> 01:08:21,740
You got any other questions?

1247
01:08:21,940 --> 01:08:24,156
Yeah, i think the name
of the operation is offensive.

1248
01:08:24,356 --> 01:08:27,169
ABSCAM.
Arab Scam? It's racist.

1249
01:08:28,272 --> 01:08:29,193
Are you fucking kidding me?

1250
01:08:29,393 --> 01:08:31,863
What do you care?
You're a Mexican.

1251
01:08:46,661 --> 01:08:48,990
Hello, Sheikh.
- ___

1252
01:08:50,205 --> 01:08:51,187
Welcome!

1253
01:08:51,387 --> 01:08:53,777
On behalf of the
great state of New Jersey.

1254
01:08:54,055 --> 01:08:55,410
I wanna welcome you to New Jersey.

1255
01:09:00,036 --> 01:09:01,452
Thank you, thank you.

1256
01:09:03,455 --> 01:09:06,159
We have a great party planned
for this evening.

1257
01:09:06,359 --> 01:09:08,692
What are you talking about,
I can't go?

1258
01:09:08,892 --> 01:09:10,778
I just did my hair
and make up and everything!

1259
01:09:10,978 --> 01:09:11,978
The Sheikh's a very particular.

1260
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,167
It's an international
cultural protocol. You know.

1261
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:18,894
International Protocol.
What the fuck are you talking about?

1262
01:09:19,094 --> 01:09:21,530
Do not answer that,
Do not answer!

1263
01:09:21,730 --> 01:09:22,730
Hello?
- Robert Spencer for Irving.

1264
01:09:23,180 --> 01:09:25,210
Robert Spencer,
I don't know a Robert Spencer.

1265
01:09:25,610 --> 01:09:26,700
What do you want?
- I'm a business associate..

1266
01:09:27,230 --> 01:09:29,156
Who is that?

1267
01:09:29,356 --> 01:09:31,281
For god's sake,
I told you not to call here.

1268
01:09:31,481 --> 01:09:34,039
Alright?
- Two more Federal agents tonight.

1269
01:09:34,239 --> 01:09:35,239
No, what?

1270
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:37,402
Two Feds.
- No.

1271
01:09:37,602 --> 01:09:39,665
I need them,
bodyguards for the Sheikh.

1272
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:41,700
No, no. Too many guys,
too many to control. No.

1273
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:44,221
Irving? Remember who's
in charge here.

1274
01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:46,780
Rosalyn, get off the extention.

1275
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:48,706
I'm not on it.

1276
01:09:48,906 --> 01:09:51,039
Look, don't call here again, alright.
Don't call at home.

1277
01:09:51,239 --> 01:09:52,239
Alright. Okay, bye.
- Alright.

1278
01:09:53,860 --> 01:09:56,410
It's a business call.
Don't interrupt. Alright?

1279
01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:01,350
Federal Agents?
- It's bodyguards for visiting dignitaries.

1280
01:10:01,550 --> 01:10:02,550
That's all.

1281
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:05,182
What is it? An IRS thing.
Like a tax investigation?

1282
01:10:05,382 --> 01:10:07,214
Why you gotta say that?
That's why I can't invite you.

1283
01:10:07,414 --> 01:10:09,212
It's too complicated.
- Are you in trouble?

1284
01:10:09,412 --> 01:10:11,201
Stop being nosy. Look at these shit.
- Well, i'm nosy.

1285
01:10:11,401 --> 01:10:12,401
Cos, you never tell me anything.

1286
01:10:15,950 --> 01:10:17,890
Do not answer that!
- Hello?

1287
01:10:18,090 --> 01:10:19,090
<i>It's Carmine.</i>

1288
01:10:19,370 --> 01:10:21,200
Oh, hi..Carmine.
We're just talking about you.

1289
01:10:21,700 --> 01:10:23,804
Yeah, Irving is being a mean, boring man.

1290
01:10:24,004 --> 01:10:25,004
Saying that he doesn't want me tonight.
<i>- Tell him he is crazy!</i>

1291
01:10:25,950 --> 01:10:27,890
Well, I agree.
Tell him yourself.

1292
01:10:28,830 --> 01:10:31,038
Can you imagine.
- Cos, you're coming.

1293
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:33,300
Yeah, Tell him yourself.

1294
01:10:34,060 --> 01:10:36,467
Irving, you're crazy.
Your wife is coming,

1295
01:10:36,667 --> 01:10:37,667
You're kidding me.
She's the life of the party.

1296
01:10:37,867 --> 01:10:38,867
We enlist her.

1297
01:10:41,323 --> 01:10:42,692
You know what she's like,
she is unpredictable.

1298
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:46,480
Hey, don't talk about me, like that!
What is Carmine saying?

1299
01:10:47,140 --> 01:10:48,090
Carmine loves me.

1300
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:51,259
This is really big night for us.
You understand?

1301
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:55,506
C'mon, you gotta bring your wife.
Dolly has got something special for her, right?

1302
01:10:55,706 --> 01:10:56,259
Listen, listen.

1303
01:10:56,260 --> 01:10:59,666
I got the nail polish for you, sweetie.

1304
01:10:59,866 --> 01:11:00,866
What is it?

1305
01:11:02,450 --> 01:11:04,220
Tell me.

1306
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:06,580
What is it?
You got a girlfriend coming?

1307
01:11:06,780 --> 01:11:08,513
C'mon, i thought we are friends.

1308
01:11:13,270 --> 01:11:15,869
Look, we're handling this like men.
You understand? Bring your wife.

1309
01:11:16,069 --> 01:11:17,069
We'll have a good time.

1310
01:11:17,090 --> 01:11:18,138
We'll see you there.
It'll be fun.

1311
01:11:18,338 --> 01:11:21,140
That's an order from your mayor.
Goodbye.

1312
01:11:21,340 --> 01:11:23,782
Alright, you happy?
Go get ready.

1313
01:11:24,340 --> 01:11:28,420
Yes, I am happy.

1314
01:12:22,425 --> 01:12:28,120
I know who you are.

1315
01:12:28,790 --> 01:12:31,035
I know who that is, Irving.

1316
01:12:39,075 --> 01:12:41,755
Oh, it looks beautiful.
- So, this is the lobby.

1317
01:12:43,870 --> 01:12:46,369
Reminds you a week ago,
this place was a mess.

1318
01:12:46,370 --> 01:12:49,336
But, what existed was this,
plaster work.

1319
01:12:49,536 --> 01:12:50,536
Look at the detail.
It's beautiful.

1320
01:12:50,805 --> 01:12:53,369
My son is a craftman.
Please, tell him what you did.

1321
01:12:53,569 --> 01:12:58,421
I did birds, sky..clouds.
____

1322
01:13:00,020 --> 01:13:01,631
This saved us 50 million.
Look at me.

1323
01:13:01,831 --> 01:13:02,831
50 million,
right of the bat.

1324
01:13:03,031 --> 01:13:04,031
Like that.

1325
01:13:04,231 --> 01:13:05,231
I waived a loan.
Got the help, right?

1326
01:13:06,150 --> 01:13:08,221
Instead of constructions having to
build ground up, new.

1327
01:13:08,421 --> 01:13:09,421
We don't do 'new'.

1328
01:13:09,935 --> 01:13:11,204
We renovate, right.

1329
01:13:11,404 --> 01:13:12,858
We used some temporary funds.

1330
01:13:13,058 --> 01:13:16,313
The gaming tables, some roulette..
For people to have a good time.

1331
01:13:16,513 --> 01:13:17,265
It's for charity.

1332
01:13:18,015 --> 01:13:20,760
Support some legal programs and
some art programs.

1333
01:13:26,445 --> 01:13:27,745
This is the Oyster room.

1334
01:13:31,916 --> 01:13:34,375
There's some gentlemen,
sitting over there at the bar.

1335
01:13:35,770 --> 01:13:39,214
That's a 130 years sitting right there.
That's how many times between them.

1336
01:13:39,733 --> 01:13:40,733
They run the biggest casinos
in the united states.

1337
01:13:42,110 --> 01:13:43,380
We have to work with them.
- Right.

1338
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,510
The good new is..

1339
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:48,010
..They know how it's done.
They get it done.

1340
01:13:48,210 --> 01:13:50,056
You don't have to worry.
Everyone makes their money.

1341
01:13:50,256 --> 01:13:52,395
You mean the mob?
- Yes, but they're business men.

1342
01:13:53,540 --> 01:13:55,329
Spend at much or little time
with them as you like.

1343
01:13:55,529 --> 01:13:56,529
But, we do have to deal with them.

1344
01:13:57,070 --> 01:13:59,266
All we gotta do is go and say, 'Hello'.
Just gotta say, Hi.

1345
01:14:01,105 --> 01:14:03,457
We gotta confirm before
we talk to those guys.

1346
01:14:03,657 --> 01:14:05,653
Confirm?
What is there to confirm about.

1347
01:14:08,065 --> 01:14:09,737
I don't understand,
they're casino guys!

1348
01:14:10,565 --> 01:14:12,961
Irving, we came all this way.
We should be here.

1349
01:14:13,161 --> 01:14:15,110
What is everybody scared of.

1350
01:14:15,865 --> 01:14:18,435
Those are the guys,
that you guys are all scared of?

1351
01:14:18,635 --> 01:14:20,934
Those guys over there?
They don't scare me.

1352
01:14:21,134 --> 01:14:22,970
Rosalyn..Rosalyn?

1353
01:14:35,404 --> 01:14:37,076
Irving, that's not the way to do this.

1354
01:14:40,485 --> 01:14:42,022
I love this!

1355
01:14:46,302 --> 01:14:49,549
Kids, I want you to go up and
get some soda and pizzas please.

1356
01:14:53,797 --> 01:14:55,093
I think they got this room, all wrong.

1357
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:56,825
Yeah? What would you do?

1358
01:14:58,740 --> 01:15:00,315
I would do in all black and gold.

1359
01:15:00,515 --> 01:15:03,797
I would do this bar like a big
warm, golden mirror.

1360
01:15:05,085 --> 01:15:06,595
Sounds beautiful.
- Oh, thank you.

1361
01:15:10,305 --> 01:15:12,318
And, i love that ass.
____

1362
01:15:12,518 --> 01:15:15,518
I'm sorry, Is she a wife?
- No, she is my wife.

1363
01:15:16,295 --> 01:15:17,685
Look at these fine gentlemen.

1364
01:15:18,490 --> 01:15:21,310
How are you?
- Good to see you.

1365
01:15:26,745 --> 01:15:30,731
Oh, i know because he's a party pooper.
He's so boring.

1366
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:33,779
May I present, Sheikh Abdullah.

1367
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:36,279
Gentlemen, from Abu Dhabi.

1368
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:39,831
Sheikh, these are professionals.
They run the best casinos in United States.

1369
01:15:40,031 --> 01:15:41,031
Mr.Sheikh,

1370
01:15:41,265 --> 01:15:44,045
As a sign of our seriousness, Mr.Tallegio
came from Miami to meet you tonight.

1371
01:15:44,415 --> 01:15:47,015
Mr.Tallegio?

1372
01:15:47,340 --> 01:15:49,570
Why didn't you tell me, Mr.Tallegio is here.
- He's in the back room.

1373
01:15:49,770 --> 01:15:52,113
It's a sign of disrespect to talk,

1374
01:15:52,313 --> 01:15:54,329
business. On the first meeting.
- That's not true.

1375
01:15:54,330 --> 01:15:58,476
Yeah, I don't know what you're talking about.
He's got it all wrong.

1376
01:15:58,676 --> 01:16:00,239
You wanna leave him back there,
in the back room waiting?

1377
01:16:00,439 --> 01:16:01,439
We gotta meet him.

1378
01:16:01,639 --> 01:16:02,639
My friend from New York
doesn't know the custom...

1379
01:16:03,905 --> 01:16:06,675
Hey, Irving i'm gonna be having fun.
Maybe, it will be contagious, huh?

1380
01:16:13,452 --> 01:16:15,263
Can you believe
that he talk to me that way?

1381
01:16:23,450 --> 01:16:24,770
Carmine?

1382
01:16:25,580 --> 01:16:27,310
Victor Tellegio was from Miami.

1383
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:30,210
He was Meyer Lansky's right hand man.

1384
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:33,470
With his prior reputation,
as an enforcer from..

1385
01:16:34,050 --> 01:16:36,892
..20 years ago was known,
to never bury a body;

1386
01:16:37,092 --> 01:16:40,078
B'cos, he felt it sent a stronger message.
To leave it on the street.

1387
01:16:44,523 --> 01:16:47,571
This is the guy,
we now have to deal with.

1388
01:16:50,218 --> 01:16:52,199
Are you sure, you don't wanna
go out there. It's new bar.

1389
01:16:52,719 --> 01:16:54,470
It's beautiful out there..
- I don't have to go out there.

1390
01:16:54,670 --> 01:16:56,408
I like it here.
There is an exit.

1391
01:16:56,608 --> 01:16:57,720
I'm like a ghost.

1392
01:16:58,130 --> 01:17:00,020
Nobody knows i am here.

1393
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:03,480
Tell him, I speak
for our friends in Florida.

1394
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:07,520
We're very excited.
It's been our life long dream

1395
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:10,070
to build Casinos resorts
in the east coast.

1396
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:14,260
You told him that.

1397
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:18,654
They don't want the Jews to make money.
They don't want the Italians to make money.

1398
01:17:18,854 --> 01:17:19,854
They definitely don't want
the blacks to make money.

1399
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:22,070
After, the oil embargo..

1400
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:23,620
Gasoline crisis.

1401
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:25,830
The hijacking, the olympics.

1402
01:17:26,340 --> 01:17:27,420
They don't wanna see Arabs,

1403
01:17:27,790 --> 01:17:30,732
make money.
Plus, not on our soils.

1404
01:17:31,710 --> 01:17:33,550
I don't know, if you can tell him
in your own way.

1405
01:17:34,700 --> 01:17:36,903
I've been in the casino business,
for forty years.

1406
01:17:37,103 --> 01:17:39,358
It's scrutinised more careful
then any other business.

1407
01:17:40,460 --> 01:17:41,720
Carmine made this legal, but..

1408
01:17:42,650 --> 01:17:45,010
We must be careful or they
will take it away.

1409
01:17:46,450 --> 01:17:50,218
So, Mr.Tallegio..how do you think
we should approach this?

1410
01:17:50,418 --> 01:17:51,418
What do you wanna do?

1411
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:55,630
If you wanna get the gaming
license and keep it.

1412
01:17:56,220 --> 01:17:59,150
We have to make our principle
investor here, The Sheikh.

1413
01:18:00,170 --> 01:18:02,583
An American citizen.

1414
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:12,050
Lots to expedite, citizenship.

1415
01:18:12,810 --> 01:18:15,643
One that requires special treatment.

1416
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:20,960
Well, you would know
the right people to do that.

1417
01:18:21,610 --> 01:18:25,104
U.S Senators.
U.S congressmen Senators.

1418
01:18:25,304 --> 01:18:27,415
Wow! That's fantastic!

1419
01:18:28,791 --> 01:18:32,204
I say, stay away from that.
That's bad. That's trouble.

1420
01:18:34,406 --> 01:18:35,548
Irving please?

1421
01:18:35,748 --> 01:18:38,208
Who is this guy?
Who are you..huh?

1422
01:18:38,450 --> 01:18:39,861
What are you, a farmer?

1423
01:18:40,950 --> 01:18:43,277
Mr.Tallegio, i'm sorry..
This is Irving.

1424
01:18:43,477 --> 01:18:45,949
He is Irving Rosenfeld.

1425
01:18:45,950 --> 01:18:48,190
New York business man.
- What's the matter, Irving?

1426
01:18:49,140 --> 01:18:51,639
What's the problem?
- Nothing, no problem.

1427
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:54,139
Don't get your balls in an uproar.

1428
01:18:54,140 --> 01:18:55,752
Everything is fine.
Everything is good.

1429
01:18:55,952 --> 01:18:56,952
It's all good. It's all good.

1430
01:18:57,152 --> 01:18:59,180
It's all good.
I just hope....

1431
01:18:59,620 --> 01:19:00,860
the other part of this
is all good.

1432
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:02,490
And real.

1433
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,610
Because, we are real.
You know that.

1434
01:19:05,810 --> 01:19:07,999
You deal with us,
we are real organisation.

1435
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:10,516
We're dealing with..
We don't know what we're dealing with.

1436
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,180
Where is he from?

1437
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:21,373
Abu Dhabi.

1438
01:19:21,573 --> 01:19:23,607
Oh, he's from the Emirates?
- Yeah.

1439
01:20:01,460 --> 01:20:03,460
I think..I think, what is...

1440
01:20:03,660 --> 01:20:05,731
Let him speak for himself.

1441
01:20:35,919 --> 01:20:36,935
What are the fucking odds,

1442
01:20:37,135 --> 01:20:39,642
you got an italian guy from Miami,
knowing Arabic.

1443
01:20:39,842 --> 01:20:42,425
It turns out, he's got casino
investments, in the middle east.

1444
01:20:42,625 --> 01:20:44,981
And, he spent two years
learning it to keep the upper hand.

1445
01:20:45,181 --> 01:20:46,181
Listen to me carefully.

1446
01:20:46,755 --> 01:20:49,055
If you really put 10 million in
the bank of our choice.

1447
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:52,379
In the next two weeks.
- Carmine, listen me carefully.

1448
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:55,508
You put 10 million in the bank or our choice.
In the next two weeks, or..

1449
01:20:55,708 --> 01:20:57,425
Not only will the Sheikh feel something.

1450
01:20:57,625 --> 01:21:00,501
But, our friends in Florida
will feel deeply disrespected.

1451
01:21:00,701 --> 01:21:01,701
So, will I.

1452
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:14,616
Rosalyn, you need to come
with me, alright.

1453
01:21:14,816 --> 01:21:17,319
Oh, you want me to come with you?
- Please, just stop alright.

1454
01:21:17,519 --> 01:21:18,519
Oh, you think I should
come with you?

1455
01:21:19,435 --> 01:21:20,660
Get your fucking hands off me.

1456
01:21:26,565 --> 01:21:28,022
This is my hausband's whore!

1457
01:21:33,268 --> 01:21:34,371
You alright?

1458
01:21:36,631 --> 01:21:38,239
Whatever is meant to be, will be.

1459
01:21:38,439 --> 01:21:40,596
Alright?
- I always say that.

1460
01:21:40,796 --> 01:21:41,836
You say that?
- Yeah.

1461
01:21:42,036 --> 01:21:44,432
Kindred spirits.
- Whatever is meant to be, will be.

1462
01:21:44,632 --> 01:21:46,001
Whatever is meant to be, will be.

1463
01:22:00,781 --> 01:22:02,318
What the hell do you think
you are doing?

1464
01:22:02,518 --> 01:22:04,613
What do i think, what i'm doing?
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

1465
01:22:04,813 --> 01:22:06,659
You're gonna come and just me
for flirting..

1466
01:22:06,660 --> 01:22:09,455
..While you've been fucking
my hausband for how many years?!

1467
01:22:09,665 --> 01:22:11,352
You don't have a fucking clue
what's going on.

1468
01:22:11,552 --> 01:22:14,444
I got a ring on my finger.
We have a child together!

1469
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:17,379
He doesn't love you, Rosalyn.
He loves me and you know it..

1470
01:22:17,380 --> 01:22:19,767
And, I know it.
He knows it.

1471
01:22:19,967 --> 01:22:22,040
It maybe done now.
It was beautiful and it was real.

1472
01:22:22,670 --> 01:22:23,760
And, we loved each other.
- Stop it.

1473
01:22:24,460 --> 01:22:27,023
Shut up!
- You scared him, you manipulate him...

1474
01:22:27,223 --> 01:22:28,223
And, you use your son!

1475
01:22:31,550 --> 01:22:33,560
Well, he must like it on some level.
He must want it.

1476
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:35,552
Because, he keeps coming back for it.

1477
01:22:35,752 --> 01:22:37,208
It's like that perfume that you love,

1478
01:22:37,408 --> 01:22:39,963
You can't stop smelling.
Even when there's something sour in it.

1479
01:22:40,163 --> 01:22:41,550
Can't get enough of it.

1480
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:44,720
But, guess what?
He's never gonna leave me.

1481
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:50,808
He is always going to want me.
And, I will make you so sorry Edith.

1482
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:53,782
I will make you so sorry
for what you've done to my family.

1483
01:22:53,982 --> 01:22:54,982
Mark my words!

1484
01:22:55,190 --> 01:22:56,500
That's fucked up!

1485
01:22:57,130 --> 01:22:58,979
I would never say
anything that's fucked up..

1486
01:22:59,179 --> 01:23:00,934
To anybody. But, you did.
B'cos you're gross inside.

1487
01:23:01,134 --> 01:23:03,529
Oh, I'm gross inside?
Maybe, your gross inside...

1488
01:23:03,530 --> 01:23:06,326
both robbing people
and all that shit that you do.

1489
01:23:06,526 --> 01:23:08,760
Maybe, we are both gross inside.
That's what Irving loves about us.

1490
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:09,960
At least, he is consistant.

1491
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:12,250
You know sometimes in life,
all you have,

1492
01:23:12,650 --> 01:23:15,588
are fucked up,
poisonous choices.

1493
01:24:37,330 --> 01:24:39,217
Ladies and gentlemen,
Our friend..

1494
01:24:39,417 --> 01:24:42,260
Working men friend..
My friend.

1495
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:43,460
Mayor Carmine Polito!

1496
01:24:48,240 --> 01:24:49,745
Hello, Camden.

1497
01:24:50,315 --> 01:24:51,770
Hello, New Jersey.

1498
01:24:52,305 --> 01:24:54,660
Hello, Atlantic City!

1499
01:25:03,330 --> 01:25:06,546
A lot of my friends,

1500
01:25:06,746 --> 01:25:09,274
A lot of good working families.

1501
01:25:09,700 --> 01:25:11,835
Just wanna work and live.

1502
01:25:13,635 --> 01:25:15,360
They say, there's no money,
no where.

1503
01:25:16,325 --> 01:25:18,055
You gotta be kidding me!

1504
01:25:18,255 --> 01:25:21,089
Don't they know,
we build this country!

1505
01:25:23,740 --> 01:25:26,837
One thing we can all afree upon,
in the state of New Jersey,

1506
01:25:27,205 --> 01:25:30,705
is that, we never;
never ever give up. Do we?!

1507
01:25:30,905 --> 01:25:31,905
- NO!

1508
01:25:35,750 --> 01:25:39,077
Please, raise your glass with me.

1509
01:25:39,277 --> 01:25:40,277
To a new era.

1510
01:25:41,365 --> 01:25:42,575
It begins tonight.

1511
01:25:43,140 --> 01:25:46,560
From me, and my family..

1512
01:25:47,095 --> 01:25:49,330
We thank you.

1513
01:25:49,530 --> 01:25:50,530
For all the hard work that
you have given us.

1514
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:52,837
In the community..

1515
01:25:53,037 --> 01:25:56,175
Look what you've done.
It's beautiful!

1516
01:25:56,375 --> 01:25:59,171
Thank You!

1517
01:27:21,818 --> 01:27:23,235
Edith?

1518
01:27:28,540 --> 01:27:29,610
Can I use your phone?

1519
01:27:35,593 --> 01:27:38,821
Last night was insane.
I got it all figured out.

1520
01:27:43,015 --> 01:27:44,143
Stauton Thorson?

1521
01:27:44,343 --> 01:27:47,646
Listen, I need the Sherman suite
at the Plaza Hotel, Okay?

1522
01:27:47,846 --> 01:27:48,846
That's the whole floor of the hotel.

1523
01:27:49,390 --> 01:27:51,066
No, no, no.
I need the whole floor.

1524
01:27:51,266 --> 01:27:52,266
I need it for my operation.

1525
01:27:53,180 --> 01:27:54,450
Stop calling it your operation, Richard.

1526
01:27:55,190 --> 01:27:57,689
It's not you operation and
I'm not giving you a whole floor of..

1527
01:27:57,690 --> 01:27:58,781
The Plaza Hotel.

1528
01:27:58,981 --> 01:28:01,285
I have members of the congress
coming in right now

1529
01:28:01,485 --> 01:28:03,431
trying to get the Sheikh
Citizenship, alright?

1530
01:28:03,631 --> 01:28:04,631
They are taking bribes.

1531
01:28:04,831 --> 01:28:05,831
It's happening right now.

1532
01:28:06,031 --> 01:28:07,031
That's happening right now!

1533
01:28:07,350 --> 01:28:10,250
Bribing members of congress..
Are you out of your fucking mind?

1534
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:12,603
Stauton, Stauton!
Shut up!

1535
01:28:12,803 --> 01:28:13,803
You know who Victor Tellegio..

1536
01:28:14,003 --> 01:28:15,003
Victor Tellegio,

1537
01:28:16,020 --> 01:28:18,554
works for Meyer Lansky.
You know who that is?

1538
01:28:19,220 --> 01:28:20,360
Resorts international.

1539
01:28:20,930 --> 01:28:23,983
Alright? He wants 10 million dollars.
I have two weeks. I have...

1540
01:28:24,183 --> 01:28:26,537
Just listen to me. Listen to me..

1541
01:28:27,030 --> 01:28:28,060
You're not listening to me!

1542
01:28:28,980 --> 01:28:30,340
I have two weeks!

1543
01:28:30,670 --> 01:28:32,365
I have two weeks to put this
thing together.

1544
01:28:32,565 --> 01:28:36,003
And, I need you to get me the Sheman
Suite at the Plaza Hotel!

1545
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:37,420
<i>Lower your voice.</i>
- How the fuck am I doing.

1546
01:28:44,032 --> 01:28:45,353
Help me out Edith.

1547
01:28:45,553 --> 01:28:46,808
Calm me down.

1548
01:28:48,476 --> 01:28:50,109
You gotta calm me down.

1549
01:28:50,309 --> 01:28:51,309
You gotta calm me down.

1550
01:28:58,210 --> 01:29:00,563
Baby, let's do this right now.

1551
01:29:01,540 --> 01:29:04,290
No, no..no.
- I wanna do this right now.

1552
01:29:05,230 --> 01:29:06,576
Look at your skin.
Oh, my god!

1553
01:29:06,776 --> 01:29:07,776
Your fucking skin is glowing, baby.

1554
01:29:07,976 --> 01:29:09,521
Your fucking skin is glowing.

1555
01:29:09,721 --> 01:29:12,809
We are not gonna back on...
- I wanna do it now!

1556
01:29:13,009 --> 01:29:14,009
That's what we agreed on, alright.

1557
01:29:14,209 --> 01:29:15,209
So, we're not gonna do that, alright?

1558
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:17,720
Where are you?

1559
01:29:18,250 --> 01:29:21,036
You're acting all scared.
You okay? You're here with me?

1560
01:29:21,236 --> 01:29:22,120
I love you.

1561
01:29:24,660 --> 01:29:27,639
It is real now. I just..
I just said it.

1562
01:29:28,060 --> 01:29:29,380
So, now is the time.

1563
01:29:30,415 --> 01:29:32,392
Look at me, look at me.
I love you.

1564
01:29:32,592 --> 01:29:35,298
I love you.

1565
01:29:37,074 --> 01:29:39,257
I just said that.

1566
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:02,220
I'm ready for real.

1567
01:30:03,030 --> 01:30:04,160
This is real, Do you hear my voice?

1568
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:07,870
This is real.

1569
01:30:08,850 --> 01:30:11,341
This is real.
I want you to hear what's real.

1570
01:30:12,558 --> 01:30:14,159
What?

1571
01:30:15,630 --> 01:30:17,210
This is me.
- What do you mean?

1572
01:30:17,640 --> 01:30:18,930
Well, you're doing an accent?

1573
01:30:19,240 --> 01:30:21,720
Your american accent?
- No, there's no english.

1574
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:24,005
There's only American.
There's no English.

1575
01:30:24,370 --> 01:30:26,390
What are you talking about?

1576
01:30:27,390 --> 01:30:31,080
Stop it, you're Edith.
Your birth records say..

1577
01:30:31,790 --> 01:30:34,690
I falsified my records back to birth.
I falsified them.

1578
01:30:38,340 --> 01:30:41,775
My name is Sydney Prosser.
I am from Albuqurque, New Mexico.

1579
01:30:42,750 --> 01:30:44,890
I'm not Edith Greensly.
There is no Edith Greensly.

1580
01:30:55,620 --> 01:30:57,630
You're..freaking..me out.

1581
01:31:06,890 --> 01:31:08,020
No, you said it in the stall.

1582
01:31:09,380 --> 01:31:10,820
That we are gonna be real.

1583
01:31:11,770 --> 01:31:13,450
And, that we aren't gonna fake it.

1584
01:31:14,050 --> 01:31:15,360
I'm being real now.

1585
01:31:16,280 --> 01:31:17,520
This is who I am.
I am Sydney Prosser.

1586
01:31:17,990 --> 01:31:18,990
Okay?

1587
01:31:20,110 --> 01:31:22,720
So, why did you do an
english accent?

1588
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:25,320
After that.

1589
01:31:27,020 --> 01:31:28,380
I'm sorry, I didn't tell you
in the stall.

1590
01:31:29,270 --> 01:31:31,960
I created Edith, b'cos
I need it her to survive. Okay?

1591
01:31:32,160 --> 01:31:33,160
But, i'm done with her now.

1592
01:31:33,490 --> 01:31:34,540
I'm so fucking done with it.

1593
01:31:35,890 --> 01:31:38,207
Right..you do what you need to survive, right?

1594
01:31:40,210 --> 01:31:41,360
You uh...

1595
01:31:41,970 --> 01:31:45,100
You know, you live with your mom.
You have a fiance, you don't even acknowledge.

1596
01:31:45,630 --> 01:31:47,620
That's what you do.
You curl your hair with your..

1597
01:31:48,050 --> 01:31:49,650
..Fucking curlers. Which is..

1598
01:31:50,130 --> 01:31:51,310
No, it's okay.
You will go with it.

1599
01:31:52,130 --> 01:31:53,040
You know..

1600
01:31:53,430 --> 01:31:55,526
You have straight hair.
That's what you do to survive.

1601
01:31:55,726 --> 01:31:57,964
You do all sorts of things.
You know, we all do.

1602
01:32:01,260 --> 01:32:02,410
I'm confused.

1603
01:32:04,350 --> 01:32:06,500
I'm confused.
- I'm fucking confused too. Alright?

1604
01:32:06,700 --> 01:32:07,700
I think we should fuck.

1605
01:32:07,970 --> 01:32:09,370
And then, we'll feel it.

1606
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:12,480
And then, we won't be confused anymore.

1607
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:18,417
No, I wanna talk it over.
I don't wanna fuck, Okay? No.

1608
01:32:18,617 --> 01:32:19,617
I think we will be better.

1609
01:32:20,110 --> 01:32:24,840
No. I'm not fucking you.
I'm not FUCKING fucking you.

1610
01:32:27,100 --> 01:32:28,020
Shit!

1611
01:32:31,590 --> 01:32:33,600
Oh, my God!

1612
01:32:37,880 --> 01:32:40,644
Will you please step away from Edith.
Please? I am asking you nicely.

1613
01:32:40,844 --> 01:32:41,844
Please, step away from Edith right now.

1614
01:32:42,044 --> 01:32:43,044
Come on, step away from her.
Please?

1615
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:45,660
You mean, Sydney?

1616
01:32:49,290 --> 01:32:50,560
I told him, I'm sorry.

1617
01:32:52,610 --> 01:32:54,657
I just don't give a fuck anymore.
I don't give a fuck.

1618
01:32:54,857 --> 01:32:55,857
I don't fucking care.

1619
01:32:58,770 --> 01:32:59,820
Irving with a gun, right?

1620
01:33:01,060 --> 01:33:02,790
Where Richie has got us into
is worst than jail.

1621
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,672
I told you last night.

1622
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:07,310
Those scores weren't good.

1623
01:33:07,790 --> 01:33:09,710
And, what. Now, what?
No one is getting...

1624
01:33:10,350 --> 01:33:11,820
Ten million for Tallegio.
It's over.

1625
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:14,710
I don't think so.
- What?

1626
01:33:14,910 --> 01:33:15,700
What do you mean?

1627
01:33:17,970 --> 01:33:20,880
Because, when Tallegio finds out
what happens. You think he's gonna go after me?

1628
01:33:21,860 --> 01:33:23,340
Someone from the bureau.

1629
01:33:24,380 --> 01:33:25,570
He isn't gonna go after the politicians.

1630
01:33:27,080 --> 01:33:28,420
He's gonna kill you.

1631
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:32,000
And, he is gonna go after your son.

1632
01:33:34,420 --> 01:33:35,500
And, Sydney.

1633
01:33:43,933 --> 01:33:45,141
<i>Stauton Thorson?</i>

1634
01:33:45,341 --> 01:33:47,091
Yeah, you're gonna give me.
The Sherman suite.

1635
01:33:47,291 --> 01:33:51,193
The whole floor.
- That's a no. I said 'no' whacko. Jesus!

1636
01:33:51,580 --> 01:33:54,865
And, you're gonna tell me
the point of that fucking fishing story.

1637
01:33:55,065 --> 01:33:57,229
Not the way your behaving.

1638
01:33:57,429 --> 01:33:59,184
What's the matter with you?
Where are you right now?

1639
01:33:59,384 --> 01:34:00,384
What does that make a difference?

1640
01:34:00,680 --> 01:34:02,110
Just tell me, where the fuck you are.

1641
01:34:02,310 --> 01:34:04,601
Field Office, at 61st street.

1642
01:34:04,801 --> 01:34:05,920
I'm coming at 61st street,

1643
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:09,087
right now.
- You're gonna do, what?

1644
01:34:09,287 --> 01:34:10,940
To beat... your ass.

1645
01:34:11,140 --> 01:34:12,140
You'll do what?

1646
01:34:20,210 --> 01:34:21,090
You were right.

1647
01:34:23,649 --> 01:34:25,314
We should've gone away.

1648
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:27,460
I wish now, i'd leave with you.

1649
01:34:28,110 --> 01:34:30,014
We are suppose to do from
the feet up.

1650
01:34:30,214 --> 01:34:31,214
Like you always said.

1651
01:34:31,300 --> 01:34:33,390
That's how we were meant to do.
Only you didn't do it like that.

1652
01:34:33,890 --> 01:34:35,380
You didn't do it like that.

1653
01:34:35,700 --> 01:34:38,199
You played it safe. So, there's always
a danger you're gonna end up

1654
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:40,105
with Rosalyn. And, the dead space.

1655
01:34:40,305 --> 01:34:43,786
Floating on some dead spaceship.
With the furnitures and the curtains...

1656
01:34:45,060 --> 01:34:47,175
And, I was your lifeline out.
And you were mine.

1657
01:34:47,375 --> 01:34:49,702
And, that was okay. You know?

1658
01:34:51,732 --> 01:34:54,140
I wish, I could get you back.

1659
01:35:05,683 --> 01:35:07,435
But, I can't do it without you.

1660
01:35:07,635 --> 01:35:10,259
You know that.

1661
01:35:13,476 --> 01:35:14,797
Come on.

1662
01:35:16,094 --> 01:35:18,794
Me, You and Danny.
Like we said.

1663
01:35:18,994 --> 01:35:22,482
Like, I said.
You never said that, I said that.

1664
01:35:25,370 --> 01:35:28,962
We gotta get over,
on all these guys!

1665
01:35:29,162 --> 01:35:31,812
That's what, we need to be thinking
about, right now.

1666
01:35:33,358 --> 01:35:34,950
Fuck's sake.

1667
01:35:37,347 --> 01:35:38,675
That's big.

1668
01:35:38,875 --> 01:35:40,784
That's fucking crazy.

1669
01:35:48,520 --> 01:35:49,928
Whatever it is.

1670
01:35:53,211 --> 01:35:56,121
It gotta be the best,
we've ever done.

1671
01:36:07,400 --> 01:36:11,018
Agent DiMaso called me,
late on the night of 21st.

1672
01:36:11,218 --> 01:36:12,825
I believe that he was intoxicated.

1673
01:36:13,025 --> 01:36:14,270
He threatened me.

1674
01:36:14,610 --> 01:36:16,040
I told him, that this was inappropriate.

1675
01:36:16,890 --> 01:36:20,460
Procedures exist for purposes that
we must respect.

1676
01:36:21,070 --> 01:36:25,002
This is the third such call,
that I received from Agent DiMaso.

1677
01:36:25,202 --> 01:36:26,202
He called me again, on the night of the 5th.

1678
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:28,180
At two a.m.

1679
01:36:28,550 --> 01:36:29,670
And, he threatened to kill me.

1680
01:36:30,980 --> 01:36:35,033
Subsequently, he demanded that I allow
him to use the Sherman Suite..

1681
01:36:35,233 --> 01:36:36,750
The Plaza hotel, for purposes..

1682
01:36:37,260 --> 01:36:39,830
Of bribing member of the Congress.

1683
01:36:42,260 --> 01:36:43,560
I am so sorry!

1684
01:36:44,630 --> 01:36:45,710
I'm not finished.

1685
01:36:46,370 --> 01:36:47,640
There's a lot more.

1686
01:36:50,930 --> 01:36:53,921
I have nothing, but the utmost respect
for you..as my mentor --

1687
01:36:54,870 --> 01:36:57,380
..as my mentor, as..
- What are you doing?

1688
01:36:57,910 --> 01:36:59,730
I just wanna talk from my heart.
I don't wanna do it on record...

1689
01:37:00,360 --> 01:37:02,420
This is just..I get vulnerable.
- Can I finish my..?

1690
01:37:04,830 --> 01:37:06,395
Can I finish my sta..
- Of course, of course.

1691
01:37:06,595 --> 01:37:07,595
That's why we're here.

1692
01:37:07,890 --> 01:37:09,170
I respect you.

1693
01:37:09,990 --> 01:37:12,430
I think you do, other things besides
respect me.

1694
01:37:13,310 --> 01:37:15,809
Hey, hey..hey!
He, what are you doing?

1695
01:37:15,810 --> 01:37:19,650
What are you doing?

1696
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:23,459
It's just hard for me to control
my passion. I'm a very passionate person.

1697
01:37:23,460 --> 01:37:25,377
We're from the __.
You understand this.

1698
01:37:25,577 --> 01:37:27,346
He goes ice fishing in teh Mid-west.

1699
01:37:27,640 --> 01:37:28,990
That was told to you
in confidence.

1700
01:37:29,670 --> 01:37:32,743
He's an 'Ice fishing guy',
Look at him.

1701
01:37:32,990 --> 01:37:34,720
What are you doing?

1702
01:37:35,560 --> 01:37:37,940
It's not you.
That's not you with a gun. Stop it.

1703
01:37:38,140 --> 01:37:40,144
You know, it's me.
It's me!

1704
01:37:40,344 --> 01:37:41,736
Don't do something
that you don't know anything about.

1705
01:37:41,936 --> 01:37:44,604
Alright?
- Wait, wait..wait. Do not load that gun.

1706
01:37:44,804 --> 01:37:45,804
You drop that gun...

1707
01:37:46,004 --> 01:37:47,004
...and then, i'm gonna hit you.
- Don't..don't!

1708
01:37:47,204 --> 01:37:49,138
Watch this, fucko!

1709
01:37:54,380 --> 01:37:55,560
So...

1710
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:58,428
You wanna use the Sherman suite,

1711
01:37:58,628 --> 01:38:00,215
the entire floor?
- Yes.

1712
01:38:01,030 --> 01:38:02,330
God!
- Of the Plaza Hotel.

1713
01:38:03,070 --> 01:38:05,569
What happend to the mafia? I thought you..
- No, no..no. This is where they intersect!

1714
01:38:05,570 --> 01:38:08,069
This is where, the two things intersect.
The two world.

1715
01:38:08,070 --> 01:38:09,876
The politicians and the Mafia.

1716
01:38:10,076 --> 01:38:11,389
Victor Tellegio's people,

1717
01:38:11,589 --> 01:38:12,589
who runs resort international..
- Right, right.

1718
01:38:12,789 --> 01:38:14,452
Victor Tellegio, showed his face?

1719
01:38:14,652 --> 01:38:16,360
Yeah, I sat with him.
I sat with Victor Tellegio.

1720
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:18,128
I hung out with him.

1721
01:38:18,328 --> 01:38:20,839
We can get him. We can get
his whole organisation.

1722
01:38:21,039 --> 01:38:22,039
As well, as getting..

1723
01:38:23,110 --> 01:38:25,280
Any numbers of congressemen..
I mean, that's just the...

1724
01:38:25,730 --> 01:38:27,060
that's just peeling the first layer
of the onion.

1725
01:38:27,570 --> 01:38:28,570
Wow.

1726
01:38:30,100 --> 01:38:31,300
How're you..how are you gonna do that?

1727
01:38:31,850 --> 01:38:34,349
We would get ten million dollars..
- Ten million dollars?

1728
01:38:34,350 --> 01:38:36,681
Ten million dollars?!
- That's how we just...

1729
01:38:36,881 --> 01:38:38,422
So, what does he say,
he's gonna do this for us?

1730
01:38:38,622 --> 01:38:41,130
How are you trapping him?
- They're gonna promise to buil casinos...

1731
01:38:41,330 --> 01:38:42,330
Handle the skims...

1732
01:38:42,430 --> 01:38:43,632
Do the licensing.

1733
01:38:43,832 --> 01:38:45,918
- You have what?
You have him on tape saying this?

1734
01:38:46,340 --> 01:38:48,192
You have that, right?
No.

1735
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:51,760
I want you to find a safer way,
to get Victor Tellegio on wiere.

1736
01:38:52,350 --> 01:38:55,356
No ten million dollars, that crazy.
- Thank you.

1737
01:38:55,556 --> 01:38:59,320
Right? Even to entrap Tallegio.
It's crazy. But...

1738
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:03,450
You can have the Shermen suite.
- No, no.

1739
01:39:03,820 --> 01:39:06,105
..To go and get me some congressmen.

1740
01:39:06,305 --> 01:39:09,832
Go and get some congressmen,
taking bribes.

1741
01:39:10,032 --> 01:39:11,832
I wanna pinch us some congressmen.

1742
01:39:12,032 --> 01:39:13,841
Okay..you come back to me.
I'm proud of you.

1743
01:39:14,041 --> 01:39:14,990
Thank you..

1744
01:39:15,770 --> 01:39:16,900
..And Stauton.

1745
01:39:18,210 --> 01:39:21,023
Good luck keeping your job,
by the way. And, staying out of jail.

1746
01:39:21,223 --> 01:39:22,223
And, not being killed by the mob!

1747
01:39:22,423 --> 01:39:24,325
But, othewise, you're doing a great job.

1748
01:39:26,630 --> 01:39:28,612
What's the end of the ice fishing story?
- I'm not telling you.

1749
01:39:28,812 --> 01:39:30,105
I'm gonna call your fucking brother,

1750
01:39:30,305 --> 01:39:31,305
to find out the end.
- My brother is dead!

1751
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:34,732
That's how it ends!
He fell to through the fucking ice!

1752
01:39:34,932 --> 01:39:36,818
NO, that's not how he dies.
He die in a different way,

1753
01:39:37,018 --> 01:39:39,062
many years later!

1754
01:39:45,090 --> 01:39:46,490
Listen, I know it's awkward and I..

1755
01:39:47,570 --> 01:39:49,580
I just wanna say, i'm sorry alright?

1756
01:39:50,140 --> 01:39:52,287
But I think, we can still
stick together and uh...

1757
01:39:52,487 --> 01:39:53,487
still fullfil on our work in here.
We got the Sherman suite.

1758
01:39:54,050 --> 01:39:56,150
You got the whole floor?
- The whole floor, yeah.

1759
01:39:57,580 --> 01:39:58,770
That's good,
- Yeah, you okay?

1760
01:39:58,970 --> 01:40:00,861
Yeah. You?

1761
01:40:01,110 --> 01:40:03,642
It's alright,
just got hit a little bit.

1762
01:40:03,842 --> 01:40:05,742
My eye, it's a little blurry.

1763
01:40:07,580 --> 01:40:09,930
You okay?
- Yeah, i'm good.

1764
01:40:10,130 --> 01:40:11,130
Listen, I'm sorry.
- I'm sory.

1765
01:40:12,750 --> 01:40:13,850
I'm sorry'er.

1766
01:40:17,970 --> 01:40:21,130
We can put camera in here.
Right in here, maybe.

1767
01:40:21,330 --> 01:40:22,330
And, we get it all on film.

1768
01:40:22,530 --> 01:40:24,052
You like it?
- We do.

1769
01:40:24,252 --> 01:40:25,252
You know, give me those flowers.

1770
01:40:25,452 --> 01:40:27,374
We put the flower vase.
You can put the camera in there.

1771
01:40:27,574 --> 01:40:30,355
And then, we get a clear shot of the couch.
So, we could put the congressman.

1772
01:40:30,555 --> 01:40:31,944
That's right.
That's the idea.

1773
01:40:32,144 --> 01:40:33,949
And Carmine will go to jail after
he delivers us,

1774
01:40:34,729 --> 01:40:35,810
Congressmen, soon to be felons.

1775
01:40:37,669 --> 01:40:39,902
Representative of O'connell's on the phone!

1776
01:40:40,102 --> 01:40:41,889
I gotta take this, you guys.
Everyone out, please.

1777
01:40:42,730 --> 01:40:44,182
This is sad.
It's just sad!

1778
01:40:44,382 --> 01:40:47,512
Dolly, i gotta take this.
- Sorry, everyone out.

1779
01:40:48,210 --> 01:40:49,310
Congressman, how're you doing?

1780
01:40:49,960 --> 01:40:50,854
It's Carmine.

1781
01:40:51,054 --> 01:40:53,134
Tell me, you're gonna be in Trenton.
This week.

1782
01:40:53,334 --> 01:40:56,404
We have an amazing investment
opportunity, I'd like to discuss with you.

1783
01:40:56,900 --> 01:40:58,490
I'm federal agent Richie DiMaso.

1784
01:40:58,980 --> 01:41:01,550
I placed 75 thousand dollars
in this briefcase.

1785
01:41:01,750 --> 01:41:03,490
For representative, John O'Connel
with the 9th district.

1786
01:41:04,230 --> 01:41:07,183
Representative O'Connel was contacted
by Carmine Polito.

1787
01:41:07,383 --> 01:41:08,383
To ask, if he could obtain
a rapid citizenship,

1788
01:41:08,583 --> 01:41:10,203
through an act of congress..

1789
01:41:10,403 --> 01:41:12,870
For one, Sheikh Abdullah--
the investor.

1790
01:41:14,130 --> 01:41:15,200
<i>I'm excited to be here.</i>

1791
01:41:15,720 --> 01:41:17,980
Oh, John please.
This brings the state back.

1792
01:41:18,450 --> 01:41:19,930
How long we've known each other?

1793
01:41:20,300 --> 01:41:21,715
You know, what's this gonna do for us?

1794
01:41:21,915 --> 01:41:22,915
This is HUGE for the state
of New Jersey.

1795
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:26,339
Stabilize our economy,
- Hotels, restaurants.

1796
01:41:26,340 --> 01:41:28,227
Carmine sees this.
It's waiting to happen.

1797
01:41:28,427 --> 01:41:29,427
This fucking this is waiting to happen!

1798
01:41:29,627 --> 01:41:31,513
But the goddamn bankers!

1799
01:41:31,713 --> 01:41:34,692
They're keeping money on the sidelines.
How're we suppose to get anything done?

1800
01:41:34,892 --> 01:41:35,892
Bankers only put money in the game...

1801
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:39,010
Where they can reap
insane profits!

1802
01:41:39,850 --> 01:41:40,920
The problem is this, Sir?

1803
01:41:41,250 --> 01:41:43,474
The citizenship..situation.

1804
01:41:43,674 --> 01:41:46,544
We gotta expidite this,
as soon as possible.

1805
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:53,788
I'll tell you,
You came to the right place.

1806
01:41:55,060 --> 01:41:56,600
We can make it happen.

1807
01:41:57,060 --> 01:41:58,309
Hey, this is going to happen.

1808
01:41:58,509 --> 01:41:59,509
Understand, this is real.

1809
01:41:59,709 --> 01:42:00,709
On my family...

1810
01:42:00,950 --> 01:42:02,805
On my kids. On my life and my work.

1811
01:42:03,005 --> 01:42:04,814
I know that, Carmine.
You are a good man.

1812
01:42:05,014 --> 01:42:06,014
I'm federal agent Richie DiMaso.

1813
01:42:06,214 --> 01:42:08,390
I placed 75 thousand dollars
in this briefcase for one...

1814
01:42:08,590 --> 01:42:11,486
representative, Jerry Sanders
of the third district.

1815
01:42:11,686 --> 01:42:12,686
I don't wanna do anything illegal.

1816
01:42:12,886 --> 01:42:13,886
Please, Jerry
use it as a campaign donation.

1817
01:42:15,105 --> 01:42:17,668
Whatever you wanna do.
- Thank you, that means a lot.

1818
01:42:17,868 --> 01:42:20,519
I'm placing 60 thousand dollars into this..
Briefcase for one,

1819
01:42:20,719 --> 01:42:22,509
Eric Keshoygan of the 4th district.

1820
01:42:22,510 --> 01:42:25,009
I'm gonna do what i can.
To help, Carmine.

1821
01:42:25,010 --> 01:42:27,509
A 100 thousand dollars
into this briefcase,

1822
01:42:27,510 --> 01:42:31,135
For two term united states Senator,
Ford Richland of New Jersey.

1823
01:42:31,490 --> 01:42:32,738
Atlantic City..

1824
01:42:32,938 --> 01:42:34,822
All the way down the shore.

1825
01:42:35,022 --> 01:42:36,735
The Mecca, by the sea.

1826
01:42:36,935 --> 01:42:41,003
Carmine, you're beloved by your people.
Your constituency...

1827
01:42:41,203 --> 01:42:42,203
It's not even a constituency.

1828
01:42:42,460 --> 01:42:45,624
It's your family.
That's what you represent, a family.

1829
01:42:45,824 --> 01:42:49,191
One small thing you do for this man,
It's a huge thing we do for,

1830
01:42:49,391 --> 01:42:51,252
the people of New Jersey.
This is what we can...

1831
01:42:51,934 --> 01:42:53,320
Irving, what're you doing?

1832
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:54,520
Where are you going?

1833
01:42:55,080 --> 01:42:56,915
Just gotta see a man about a toilet.

1834
01:42:57,580 --> 01:43:00,079
Sorry.

1835
01:43:02,580 --> 01:43:04,791
<i>Trust me, this is the probaby the
biggest opportunity,</i>

1836
01:43:04,991 --> 01:43:05,991
<i>That we could have.
- I will go where ever</i>

1837
01:43:06,460 --> 01:43:09,100
<i>I can in the united states...</i>

1838
01:43:09,620 --> 01:43:11,520
<i>I appreciate this.
- On my family, on my kids..</i>

1839
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:14,883
<i>This needs to happen.
It's gotta happen.</i>

1840
01:43:15,083 --> 01:43:19,230
<i>You have my word.</i>

1841
01:43:30,684 --> 01:43:32,188
Oh, i wanna save us.
I wanna save us!

1842
01:43:32,388 --> 01:43:34,144
I wanna save Carmine,
It's killing me, it's fucking killing...

1843
01:43:34,344 --> 01:43:37,139
The only way to help Carmine
is to do the Tellegio thing.

1844
01:43:38,200 --> 01:43:40,383
It's dangerous. It's dangerous.
We gotta get in there,

1845
01:43:40,583 --> 01:43:42,955
We gotta get a wire in there.
We gotta make him feel safe.

1846
01:43:43,390 --> 01:43:45,289
There's only one thing that
could fuck this up.

1847
01:43:45,489 --> 01:43:46,489
And, that's your wife!

1848
01:43:48,005 --> 01:43:49,679
Yeah.

1849
01:44:28,419 --> 01:44:30,531
I don't like your hausband.
You're no better together.

1850
01:44:30,731 --> 01:44:31,988
He doesn't appreciate you.

1851
01:44:32,188 --> 01:44:34,399
But, It happens.
It happened to my marriage.

1852
01:44:34,599 --> 01:44:35,880
That's why I went to Miami.

1853
01:44:37,250 --> 01:44:38,927
And, sometimes you just gotta be tough.

1854
01:44:39,127 --> 01:44:40,127
You gotta stand up.

1855
01:44:40,170 --> 01:44:41,610
You gotta leave, you know.

1856
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:45,539
Sometimes, you've gotta let
something die. To let, something live.

1857
01:44:45,980 --> 01:44:48,715
You're too beautiful, to be unhappy.

1858
01:44:49,690 --> 01:44:52,190
I mean, I don't wanna...

1859
01:44:52,850 --> 01:44:54,626
bad mouth my hausband.
But, just...

1860
01:44:54,826 --> 01:44:56,770
..let me bad mouth my hausband
just for a second.

1861
01:44:57,010 --> 01:44:59,955
He just thinks that he knows everything.
And, he's so full of shit.

1862
01:45:00,155 --> 01:45:01,155
He's such a liar!

1863
01:45:01,355 --> 01:45:03,047
He thinks that I'm stupid.
But, i'm not stupid.

1864
01:45:03,250 --> 01:45:04,550
I hear him on the phone, arguing.

1865
01:45:04,860 --> 01:45:08,422
He loves Carmine. But, he hates that
other guy. That curly headed...

1866
01:45:08,622 --> 01:45:09,622
IRS guy or whatever.

1867
01:45:09,660 --> 01:45:12,720
Who's cowering around my hausband's
ex-lover at that, red headed whore!

1868
01:45:14,690 --> 01:45:16,214
IRS?
- Anyway, you can see that,

1869
01:45:16,414 --> 01:45:17,414
It drives him crazy.

1870
01:45:17,614 --> 01:45:18,614
You said IRS.

1871
01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:21,082
What IRS guy?
What're you talking about?

1872
01:45:21,282 --> 01:45:22,282
I hear them on the phone.

1873
01:45:22,600 --> 01:45:25,016
I think that, he's got Irving
in some sort of bind or something..

1874
01:45:25,400 --> 01:45:26,920
And, he's making him do
all these sorts of stuff.

1875
01:45:27,400 --> 01:45:30,490
And so, Irving and Carmine;
are right now are at the Plaza Hotel,

1876
01:45:30,990 --> 01:45:33,330
Throwing all these money away
at like, congress or..

1877
01:45:33,700 --> 01:45:35,917
Whatever. They're giving money
to congress or something.

1878
01:45:36,117 --> 01:45:38,448
I don't really know.
But, I over heard it on the phone.

1879
01:45:40,610 --> 01:45:42,770
I hate doing this you.

1880
01:45:43,950 --> 01:45:45,610
I gotta go talk to your hausband.

1881
01:45:46,490 --> 01:45:47,770
My boss, he's already angry.

1882
01:45:48,610 --> 01:45:49,407
You stay here.

1883
01:45:49,607 --> 01:45:50,607
I'm gonna give you some money.
For a taxi home.

1884
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:53,215
Have some dessert.

1885
01:45:53,415 --> 01:45:54,415
Finish the bottle of perseco.

1886
01:45:54,730 --> 01:45:55,650
I'm sorry.

1887
01:46:03,589 --> 01:46:04,740
You alright?

1888
01:46:04,940 --> 01:46:07,125
I don't like change.

1889
01:46:11,326 --> 01:46:13,683
It's really hard for me.

1890
01:46:16,819 --> 01:46:19,989
Sometimes, i think that
I would die before I change.

1891
01:46:20,189 --> 01:46:21,189
Don't say that.

1892
01:46:27,480 --> 01:46:30,186
It's gonna be okay.
You're gonna come with me to Miami.

1893
01:46:30,500 --> 01:46:31,679
Don't hurt him too bad.

1894
01:46:31,879 --> 01:46:34,039
He is still Danny's father.

1895
01:46:50,048 --> 01:46:53,688
<i>You know you did. You know you did
You know you did.</i>

1896
01:46:54,040 --> 01:46:56,539
<i>But if this is ever changin'</i>

1897
01:46:56,540 --> 01:46:59,545
<i>world, In which we live in.</i>

1898
01:47:00,140 --> 01:47:04,708
<i>Makes you give in and cry.</i>

1899
01:47:06,755 --> 01:47:11,080
<i>Say live and let die.</i>

1900
01:47:11,765 --> 01:47:13,641
<i>Live and let die.</i>

1901
01:47:16,108 --> 01:47:18,211
<i>Live and let die.</i>

1902
01:47:35,714 --> 01:47:37,105
Life is ridiculous.

1903
01:47:37,305 --> 01:47:38,926
And, you know that
I'd never say,

1904
01:47:39,126 --> 01:47:41,246
anything bad about your father
in front of you. But,

1905
01:47:41,446 --> 01:47:42,446
Your father is a sick
son of a bitch.

1906
01:47:44,403 --> 01:47:46,348
Daddy's a sick son of a bitch?

1907
01:47:46,548 --> 01:47:47,920
Don't repeat that!

1908
01:47:48,710 --> 01:47:49,650
But, yes.

1909
01:47:58,560 --> 01:47:59,970
Rosalyn!

1910
01:48:01,050 --> 01:48:02,110
Rosalyn!

1911
01:48:03,310 --> 01:48:04,690
What?
- This is what's wrong..

1912
01:48:04,890 --> 01:48:06,548
In our relationship.
You know where I was recently?

1913
01:48:06,748 --> 01:48:07,748
I was in your boyfriend's
fucking car.

1914
01:48:08,210 --> 01:48:09,400
Alright? I saw your nail polish.

1915
01:48:13,810 --> 01:48:16,710
And, what's this i hear about your curly
haired friend working for the government?

1916
01:48:17,580 --> 01:48:19,455
What? Who said that?

1917
01:48:19,655 --> 01:48:20,655
Your fucking wife!

1918
01:48:21,580 --> 01:48:23,990
Rosalyn?
- He put a fucking canvas bag,

1919
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:26,279
over my head!

1920
01:48:26,479 --> 01:48:27,479
Hey, what the fuck?!

1921
01:48:29,973 --> 01:48:33,190
Are you happy now?
Because, he is trying to kill me?!

1922
01:48:33,390 --> 01:48:34,390
What are you talking about?!

1923
01:48:34,590 --> 01:48:36,764
What do you think, you're doing?!
- Get out of here!

1924
01:48:36,964 --> 01:48:40,445
Why are you talking so much?
You're gonna get us all killed!

1925
01:48:40,850 --> 01:48:42,249
Danny.
Come here buddy.

1926
01:48:42,930 --> 01:48:44,400
Go draw a picture or something.

1927
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:47,379
You are a sick son of a bitch
for screaming at me like that,

1928
01:48:47,579 --> 01:48:48,579
in front of Danny.

1929
01:48:50,825 --> 01:48:52,025
I'm a sick son of a bitch?

1930
01:48:52,225 --> 01:48:54,321
You tried to fucking get me killed.
I'm a sick son of a bitch?

1931
01:48:54,521 --> 01:48:56,881
My god!
You're driving me so fucking crazy!

1932
01:48:57,300 --> 01:48:59,799
You're boyfriend,
your fucking boyfriend..

1933
01:48:59,800 --> 01:49:02,321
Will fucking kill me.
He will kill Danny..

1934
01:49:02,521 --> 01:49:04,808
And, he will kill you.
- Stop talking like that!

1935
01:49:05,008 --> 01:49:07,182
He's a mobster, alright.
That's what you're dealing with.

1936
01:49:07,580 --> 01:49:11,660
Stop that! You're fine!
He'd have hurted you...

1937
01:49:11,860 --> 01:49:13,133
How do you think that I feel.

1938
01:49:13,333 --> 01:49:14,333
All day when you leave me alone.

1939
01:49:14,533 --> 01:49:18,725
All day! All i've ever wanted
you to do is love me.

1940
01:49:19,135 --> 01:49:20,627
That's all i've ever wanted.

1941
01:49:20,827 --> 01:49:24,423
That's for us to stay married
and for you to love me.

1942
01:49:24,623 --> 01:49:26,602
And, that's why i'm going to Miami.

1943
01:49:27,535 --> 01:49:30,365
I'm going to Miami, with Pete.
I'm going to Miami, with Pete!

1944
01:49:31,435 --> 01:49:33,085
I finally find somebody
who loves me!

1945
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:36,339
Just like you've always wanted.

1946
01:49:36,340 --> 01:49:38,174
Miami..not now!

1947
01:49:38,374 --> 01:49:40,020
Too fucking dangerous!
- He likes me just the way I am!

1948
01:49:40,220 --> 01:49:42,268
You're gonna stay normal.
- You told me that you wanted to find a

1949
01:49:43,260 --> 01:49:45,882
nice quite man!
- Ah, I wanted.

1950
01:49:46,082 --> 01:49:47,082
Doozy, you've picked.

1951
01:49:47,282 --> 01:49:50,129
Ohh, you have that..

1952
01:49:50,329 --> 01:49:51,329
..The most dangerous guy, yeah.

1953
01:49:51,529 --> 01:49:53,687
What'd you expect, Irving.

1954
01:49:53,887 --> 01:49:55,390
I know everybody through you!

1955
01:49:56,180 --> 01:49:57,270
Why can't you just be
happy for me?

1956
01:50:02,307 --> 01:50:03,855
Why are you taking your
heart pill Irving?

1957
01:50:04,055 --> 01:50:05,055
What's going on?

1958
01:50:05,950 --> 01:50:07,350
Irving, take your pill.

1959
01:50:08,500 --> 01:50:12,840
What kind of trouble are you in, Irving?
What is going on?

1960
01:50:13,390 --> 01:50:14,280
What's happening?

1961
01:50:18,350 --> 01:50:19,420
I got a plan.

1962
01:50:22,010 --> 01:50:23,150
You got a plan?
When did you get it?

1963
01:50:23,870 --> 01:50:24,780
You know what?

1964
01:50:27,690 --> 01:50:29,230
It really fucking came to me.

1965
01:50:30,710 --> 01:50:32,020
When i was inside of that
Canvas bag.

1966
01:50:33,320 --> 01:50:35,907
We got two million coming this week!
- You see?

1967
01:50:36,107 --> 01:50:37,107
You think, this is a fucking
down paying plan?

1968
01:50:39,450 --> 01:50:40,820
Are, we series of Chevrolet?

1969
01:50:41,830 --> 01:50:43,943
You ask Victor.

1970
01:50:44,143 --> 01:50:45,590
If he wants...

1971
01:50:47,080 --> 01:50:48,940
..two million this week.
That's real money.

1972
01:50:50,980 --> 01:50:52,006
Two million?
- Real money.

1973
01:50:52,206 --> 01:50:53,206
This week.
- How?

1974
01:50:54,150 --> 01:50:55,190
Wired in.

1975
01:51:00,840 --> 01:51:02,706
Is it true?
What he said about your wive?

1976
01:51:02,906 --> 01:51:03,906
About Rosalyn?

1977
01:51:04,106 --> 01:51:05,106
I can save all of us.

1978
01:51:05,460 --> 01:51:06,750
And we can save money.

1979
01:51:06,950 --> 01:51:09,164
That'll take care of you.

1980
01:51:09,364 --> 01:51:10,364
And, Danny.

1981
01:51:10,564 --> 01:51:13,225
Okay? But, you gotta
close your mouth.

1982
01:51:13,550 --> 01:51:14,720
I knew it.

1983
01:51:15,540 --> 01:51:19,086
I have always said, Irving.
That you're very very hard.

1984
01:51:19,286 --> 01:51:20,286
To motivate properly.

1985
01:51:20,486 --> 01:51:21,486
And, I knew..

1986
01:51:21,686 --> 01:51:25,066
That Pete was gonna go over there
and knock some sense into your head.

1987
01:51:25,266 --> 01:51:26,266
I've been reading this book, Irving.

1988
01:51:26,990 --> 01:51:29,460
It's by Wayne Dyer, that's the
"Power of intention".

1989
01:51:31,690 --> 01:51:33,740
And, my intention
in setting Pete over to you..

1990
01:51:34,710 --> 01:51:36,250
Was so that,
you could come up with this plan.

1991
01:51:37,470 --> 01:51:38,370
So..you're welcome.

1992
01:51:44,750 --> 01:51:46,020
Thank you, Rosalyn.

1993
01:51:46,630 --> 01:51:48,687
Thank you for the plan.
- You're welcome.

1994
01:51:48,887 --> 01:51:49,960
I appreciate that.

1995
01:51:50,700 --> 01:51:51,720
So, uh..

1996
01:51:53,720 --> 01:51:55,160
We should be partners on this.

1997
01:51:56,070 --> 01:51:57,800
Yeah, i'm a good partner.
I'm almost better then Edith.

1998
01:51:58,610 --> 01:52:01,340
You ever think about that?
You might've under estimated me?

1999
01:52:02,010 --> 01:52:03,520
So, what is our plan?

2000
01:52:04,390 --> 01:52:05,660
Tell me the plan.

2001
01:52:06,800 --> 01:52:08,000
What are you gonna do?

2002
01:52:09,170 --> 01:52:11,415
I'm gonna keep my mouth shut.
I'm not gonna say anything.

2003
01:52:11,615 --> 01:52:13,927
But, what do I do
if Pete calls me. What am I supposed say?

2004
01:52:14,127 --> 01:52:16,316
You gotta stop talking about
any government agencies,

2005
01:52:16,516 --> 01:52:18,942
the IRS and tax conspiracies..
And all of that.

2006
01:52:19,142 --> 01:52:20,142
You're gonna say, how you're wrong.

2007
01:52:20,342 --> 01:52:21,342
You were wrong about that.

2008
01:52:21,350 --> 01:52:22,470
I'll tell Pete, that I was wrong.

2009
01:52:23,240 --> 01:52:24,520
But, you know that in real life...

2010
01:52:25,080 --> 01:52:26,833
I was right for saying that stuff.

2011
01:52:27,033 --> 01:52:29,980
Because that spurt on the actions
that made you come up with this plan.

2012
01:52:30,180 --> 01:52:31,384
So, i will tell Pete.
- Okay.

2013
01:52:31,584 --> 01:52:34,039
The Power of Intention, Irving.

2014
01:52:34,239 --> 01:52:34,950
The Power of Intention.

2015
01:52:36,130 --> 01:52:37,070
Okay.

2016
01:52:37,450 --> 01:52:38,410
Okay.

2017
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:40,220
You are right.

2018
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:41,690
You are right.
- Irv?

2019
01:52:51,480 --> 01:52:52,870
Good job peaches.

2020
01:52:53,270 --> 01:52:54,260
Irving.

2021
01:52:54,950 --> 01:52:56,500
I've been doing a lot of thinking.

2022
01:52:59,250 --> 01:53:00,140
And,

2023
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:01,750
You need to grow up.

2024
01:53:02,810 --> 01:53:04,380
And, you need to face the facts.

2025
01:53:06,430 --> 01:53:08,565
And, i think that both of us
will be a lot happier,

2026
01:53:08,765 --> 01:53:09,765
if we get a divorce.

2027
01:53:12,351 --> 01:53:13,559
Okay.

2028
01:53:13,759 --> 01:53:14,759
Just think about it.

2029
01:53:16,879 --> 01:53:18,544
These things are never easy.

2030
01:53:21,262 --> 01:53:23,238
Alright.

2031
01:53:27,430 --> 01:53:28,470
Irving?

2032
01:53:30,320 --> 01:53:31,500
Good luck, with your plan.

2033
01:53:34,160 --> 01:53:35,620
<i>Necessity, truly is..</i>

2034
01:53:36,125 --> 01:53:37,200
<i>The mother of invention.</i>

2035
01:53:37,770 --> 01:53:40,987
<i>The FBI was willing to wire
the two million dollars,</i>

2036
01:53:41,187 --> 01:53:44,762
<i>If it meant, taking down Tellegio
and his entire organisation.</i>

2037
01:53:54,730 --> 01:53:58,915
Mobster like Tellegio
would never meet at the Plaza Hotel,

2038
01:53:59,115 --> 01:54:00,975
Put only at the office of his attorney.

2039
01:54:01,175 --> 01:54:03,123
Alphonse Simone.

2040
01:54:59,609 --> 01:55:01,872
Hi, Alphonse Simone.
- Edith Greensly.

2041
01:55:02,072 --> 01:55:03,072
Alphonse Simone.

2042
01:55:05,020 --> 01:55:06,235
Please, have a seat.

2043
01:55:06,435 --> 01:55:07,435
I appreciate the fact that,

2044
01:55:07,520 --> 01:55:10,019
You all came in person.
But, the trip was really unnecessary.

2045
01:55:10,020 --> 01:55:14,276
Because, this whole thing could've
been done with a simple wire transfer.

2046
01:55:14,476 --> 01:55:15,170
As a matter of fact..

2047
01:55:15,600 --> 01:55:17,280
This is the number on the wire,
right here.

2048
01:55:20,680 --> 01:55:22,010
Where is Mr.Tellegio?

2049
01:55:22,960 --> 01:55:25,400
Mr.Tellegio, was unfortunately
called out of town, on business.

2050
01:55:25,990 --> 01:55:26,890
Oh, that's not good.

2051
01:55:27,650 --> 01:55:30,539
We're willing to come here today.
In person, to Mr.Tellegio.

2052
01:55:30,739 --> 01:55:31,739
As a sign of respect,

2053
01:55:32,240 --> 01:55:35,176
To give two million dollars.
- I can assure you that

2054
01:55:35,376 --> 01:55:37,881
i have power of attorney,
- Excuse me, if you let me finish.

2055
01:55:38,081 --> 01:55:38,899
We are willing,

2056
01:55:39,099 --> 01:55:41,735
to give two million dollars today,
on the temp.

2057
01:55:42,310 --> 01:55:45,894
But, without Mr.Tellegio, here..?
- We can't make that decision.

2058
01:55:50,030 --> 01:55:53,129
You don't have the authorisation
to make this kind of choice,

2059
01:55:53,329 --> 01:55:54,329
So, don't be hasty alright?

2060
01:55:54,529 --> 01:55:55,529
I'm not being hasty.

2061
01:55:55,729 --> 01:55:57,938
Let's be smart about this. Alright?

2062
01:55:58,138 --> 01:55:59,138
This is not how we do business.

2063
01:55:59,338 --> 01:56:00,338
I'm sorry.

2064
01:56:06,170 --> 01:56:08,701
I think we should hang in there, alright?

2065
01:56:09,560 --> 01:56:10,570
For what?
The guy is not here.

2066
01:56:12,040 --> 01:56:13,990
That's it.
Sorry, I can't do it!

2067
01:56:14,190 --> 01:56:17,081
This is a surprise that...
the Sheikh don't like surprises.

2068
01:56:17,281 --> 01:56:18,281
Don't leave!

2069
01:56:18,410 --> 01:56:21,687
Edith, this is not the way
that decision are made.

2070
01:56:22,110 --> 01:56:24,510
No, I understand but,
maybe we can call the Sheikh.

2071
01:56:24,710 --> 01:56:25,710
Let's call the Sheikh.

2072
01:56:27,967 --> 01:56:28,999
It's not the plan.

2073
01:56:29,199 --> 01:56:30,199
It's not it.

2074
01:56:31,950 --> 01:56:33,593
I'll call the Sheikh.
Can i use your phone?

2075
01:56:33,793 --> 01:56:34,793
Please, do.

2076
01:56:36,570 --> 01:56:38,800
But, before I do.
I'd like to go over, SPECIFICALLY

2077
01:56:39,420 --> 01:56:41,250
what this money would be used for.

2078
01:56:41,450 --> 01:56:44,405
Okay. What we will do,
is we guarantee.

2079
01:56:44,605 --> 01:56:47,611
All proper licenses and contruction permits.

2080
01:56:47,950 --> 01:56:50,449
For any Hotel Casino,

2081
01:56:50,450 --> 01:56:52,716
That is planned to open before
the end of year.

2082
01:56:52,916 --> 01:56:54,815
And, we'll throw in the customary,

2083
01:56:55,823 --> 01:56:57,160
Previleges of protection.

2084
01:56:57,360 --> 01:56:58,590
What if there's obstacles?

2085
01:56:59,440 --> 01:57:01,082
What will you do
- Obstacles...

2086
01:57:01,282 --> 01:57:02,963
We are prepared to overcome
any obstacles.

2087
01:57:03,163 --> 01:57:05,292
But, this is a big enterprise.
- If we've to pay somebody off..

2088
01:57:05,492 --> 01:57:06,492
We'll pay somebody off.

2089
01:57:06,810 --> 01:57:09,309
If we have to lean on somebody,

2090
01:57:09,310 --> 01:57:12,459
We'll intimidate somebody.
We are experienced!

2091
01:57:12,659 --> 01:57:13,659
This is our business.

2092
01:57:13,859 --> 01:57:14,859
That's poweful stuffs.

2093
01:57:15,100 --> 01:57:16,630
Thank you.
- And, I'll tell you something else.

2094
01:57:16,940 --> 01:57:18,400
At the end of this.

2095
01:57:18,870 --> 01:57:21,369
We'll teach you, how to skim.
And, how to cut it up.

2096
01:57:21,370 --> 01:57:23,869
And, make some money
on the side. Because..

2097
01:57:23,870 --> 01:57:25,632
WE invented skimming.

2098
01:57:25,832 --> 01:57:26,832
We've been doing it for
thirty years!

2099
01:57:27,500 --> 01:57:29,818
Thank you.
Thank you, for clarifying that.

2100
01:57:30,018 --> 01:57:31,018
Okay.

2101
01:57:31,020 --> 01:57:32,690
I'm very happy.

2102
01:57:35,220 --> 01:57:36,310
I think that,
that will be okay for the Sheikh.

2103
01:57:38,920 --> 01:57:42,125
This is the Sheikh.
- Mr.Tellegio, is not here.

2104
01:57:42,325 --> 01:57:44,200
It's just Mr.Alphose Simone,
his lawyer.

2105
01:57:44,400 --> 01:57:45,580
Are we still okay,
to wire the money?

2106
01:57:46,660 --> 01:57:48,590
Simone can take the wire.
What's the number?

2107
01:57:49,710 --> 01:57:52,380
531..
<font color=#A4DC50>78P..</font>78P..<font color=#A4DC50>76</font>..76.

2108
01:57:55,430 --> 01:57:57,213
The funds have transfered.

2109
01:57:57,413 --> 01:57:58,413
<i>The funds have transfered.</i>

2110
01:58:00,673 --> 01:58:02,186
The money has been wired.

2111
01:58:04,970 --> 01:58:06,720
I think, we have a deal.

2112
01:58:07,200 --> 01:58:08,530
Pleasure doing business with you.

2113
01:58:09,090 --> 01:58:11,589
Okay, thank you very much,
Mr.Simone.

2114
01:58:11,590 --> 01:58:14,089
Well, thank you.
- The Sheikh is very excited.

2115
01:58:14,090 --> 01:58:16,950
I'm sure we'll be seeing each other.
- Oh, I'm sure that we'll be seeing each other.

2116
01:58:17,490 --> 01:58:19,701
I'm looking forward to it.
- So, am I.

2117
01:58:19,901 --> 01:58:20,901
You might get sick of me.

2118
01:58:21,330 --> 01:58:25,960
Like these two.
- I don't think I'll get sick of you.

2119
01:58:27,820 --> 01:58:30,870
Goodbye, nice meeting you.

2120
01:58:44,265 --> 01:58:45,340
It happened!

2121
01:58:46,330 --> 01:58:47,430
Finally!

2122
01:58:48,080 --> 01:58:49,709
Finally, we get someone in the bag.

2123
01:58:54,555 --> 01:58:56,300
Oh, oh..oh!
Wait, wait..wait?

2124
01:58:57,140 --> 01:58:59,800
<i>If we've to pay somebody off..
We'll pay somebody off.</i>

2125
01:59:00,160 --> 01:59:01,500
<i>If we have to lean on somebody,</i>

2126
01:59:01,980 --> 01:59:03,294
<i>...intimidate somebody.</i>

2127
01:59:03,494 --> 01:59:04,494
INTIMIDATE!

2128
01:59:44,164 --> 01:59:45,780
Yeah, but I gotta do it.

2129
01:59:49,860 --> 01:59:51,220
What do you mean, there is no Sheikh?
What does that mean?

2130
01:59:52,060 --> 01:59:53,190
There is no Sheikh.

2131
01:59:56,680 --> 01:59:59,397
I wanna face you like a man.
B'cos, I wanna be real about it.

2132
01:59:59,597 --> 02:00:00,597
Alright?
- Who's the man?

2133
02:00:02,900 --> 02:00:03,820
Who is they?

2134
02:00:04,020 --> 02:00:05,020
That he's the fence.

2135
02:00:05,220 --> 02:00:07,603
A fence?
- Yeah.

2136
02:00:08,260 --> 02:00:09,250
Irving...

2137
02:00:12,300 --> 02:00:14,300
look, i'm a good person.

2138
02:00:14,500 --> 02:00:15,500
You are a good person.

2139
02:00:15,980 --> 02:00:18,010
I've been doing this for a long time.
For twenty years!

2140
02:00:20,170 --> 02:00:21,440
Do you think,
I would've taken that money.

2141
02:00:21,890 --> 02:00:22,920
If it wasn't the right
thing to do?

2142
02:00:23,300 --> 02:00:24,430
Now, look..
- Huh?

2143
02:00:24,840 --> 02:00:26,050
You're a good person.

2144
02:00:26,370 --> 02:00:29,140
I know that, but in all honesty...
- You said that was the only way Irv.

2145
02:00:29,920 --> 02:00:32,970
You chased me, you remember?
- They fucking made me do it.

2146
02:00:33,880 --> 02:00:36,958
I was asked to do that or sit in jail.
- You made me go back to the plaza,

2147
02:00:37,158 --> 02:00:38,158
To take that money.
You piece of shit!

2148
02:00:38,790 --> 02:00:40,370
I was gone!

2149
02:00:40,990 --> 02:00:44,116
You fucking prick!
You motherfucker!

2150
02:00:44,316 --> 02:00:46,685
You fucking chased me,
you piece of shit!

2151
02:00:47,510 --> 02:00:49,180
Carmine?
- I was gone! I left.

2152
02:00:49,740 --> 02:00:52,456
Everything all right.
- Please, Dolly. Just go upstairs.

2153
02:00:52,656 --> 02:00:53,679
Alright..
- Take the kid and go upstairs.

2154
02:00:53,879 --> 02:00:54,879
Please..please just go.
- Of course..

2155
02:00:56,800 --> 02:00:57,893
I'll make this right.

2156
02:00:58,093 --> 02:00:59,093
I came here, because..
I wanna make it right.

2157
02:00:59,490 --> 02:01:00,730
Look at my face.

2158
02:01:01,410 --> 02:01:02,690
You tell me that I'm lying to you.

2159
02:01:04,450 --> 02:01:07,720
When i say that, everything i do,
is for the good of the people,

2160
02:01:07,920 --> 02:01:08,920
Of New Jersey.

2161
02:01:09,290 --> 02:01:11,100
Everything, I do.

2162
02:01:11,750 --> 02:01:12,990
Is for them.

2163
02:01:16,191 --> 02:01:17,440
Am I lying to you?

2164
02:01:17,640 --> 02:01:19,671
I never had a friend like you before.

2165
02:01:21,980 --> 02:01:23,750
I used that money
for that goddamn casino.

2166
02:01:27,020 --> 02:01:28,580
I got some fucking leverage, alright?

2167
02:01:29,360 --> 02:01:30,680
I can help you out.

2168
02:01:31,320 --> 02:01:33,499
This is all shit.
This is all bullshit.

2169
02:01:33,699 --> 02:01:34,699
Look at this thing.

2170
02:01:35,719 --> 02:01:36,839
Look at this.

2171
02:01:38,140 --> 02:01:40,940
Ceremonial fucking knife.
What is this, bullshit. Some toy?

2172
02:01:44,900 --> 02:01:47,470
Carmine, Syd and I got a plan for you.
- Get out.

2173
02:01:47,670 --> 02:01:48,490
We can help you out.

2174
02:01:50,450 --> 02:01:51,640
Please get out of my house, Irving.

2175
02:01:52,610 --> 02:01:55,603
Will you please leave.
I'm asking you nicely, please leave.

2176
02:01:56,740 --> 02:01:58,250
Get out of my house, go!

2177
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:00,770
Get out of our house!

2178
02:02:01,270 --> 02:02:04,910
Oh, fuck!
I'm sorry... i'm sorry.

2179
02:02:05,600 --> 02:02:09,450
I don't mean for this to happen.

2180
02:02:10,580 --> 02:02:13,290
This is what matters to me most.
And, you're crushing that.

2181
02:02:14,010 --> 02:02:15,301
You're gonna take me away from them?

2182
02:02:15,501 --> 02:02:16,501
I didn't wanna have this to
happen ever.

2183
02:02:16,701 --> 02:02:17,701
Fucking son of a bitch!

2184
02:02:19,330 --> 02:02:22,623
You son of a bitch!
- I just wanna make it right.

2185
02:02:22,823 --> 02:02:23,823
Just get out of my house.

2186
02:02:24,023 --> 02:02:25,023
Look what you made me do.
Pleae go.

2187
02:02:25,223 --> 02:02:26,223
I'm sorry Carmine.

2188
02:02:28,870 --> 02:02:33,940
Get out of here!
Get out!

2189
02:02:35,490 --> 02:02:37,700
No, Carmine... what's happening?

2190
02:02:41,745 --> 02:02:44,802
<i>Oh, My God!
No!</i>

2191
02:02:45,690 --> 02:02:48,450
Oh, fuck.
- Irving!

2192
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:50,352
Irving, are you all right?

2193
02:02:51,908 --> 02:02:53,084
Where're your heart pills?

2194
02:02:53,284 --> 02:02:54,284
Where are your heart pills?

2195
02:02:56,320 --> 02:02:57,190
There you go.

2196
02:02:59,770 --> 02:03:01,220
Okay, come on.

2197
02:03:12,790 --> 02:03:15,640
I gotta lie down.

2198
02:03:16,700 --> 02:03:18,630
Just rest.

2199
02:03:42,020 --> 02:03:43,040
You ready?

2200
02:03:43,240 --> 02:03:46,472
Yeah.

2201
02:04:05,590 --> 02:04:06,760
Please.

2202
02:04:07,450 --> 02:04:08,720
Come and sit down.

2203
02:04:21,140 --> 02:04:22,290
You know where
the two million dollars is?

2204
02:04:22,950 --> 02:04:23,970
Two million?

2205
02:04:24,800 --> 02:04:26,677
Yeah.
- With uh, Victor Tellegio,

2206
02:04:26,877 --> 02:04:27,877
and Alphonse Simone.

2207
02:04:28,077 --> 02:04:29,077
No, actually..
It's not with..

2208
02:04:29,970 --> 02:04:32,036
Victor Tellegio or Alphonse Simone.

2209
02:04:32,236 --> 02:04:33,236
He fucking knows about it.

2210
02:04:33,436 --> 02:04:34,436
It's gone missing.

2211
02:04:34,650 --> 02:04:35,810
Did you know that?

2212
02:04:36,630 --> 02:04:39,337
I know nothing about that.
Where is it gone?

2213
02:04:39,537 --> 02:04:40,650
That's interesting,
you would say that. Because,

2214
02:04:41,180 --> 02:04:43,695
While you're on your way
over here we got an..

2215
02:04:43,895 --> 02:04:44,895
Annonymous phone call..

2216
02:04:46,160 --> 02:04:47,511
From someone.

2217
02:04:47,711 --> 02:04:48,711
Who said that,

2218
02:04:49,640 --> 02:04:51,160
in exchange,

2219
02:04:51,660 --> 02:04:53,922
for immunity for the two of you...

2220
02:04:54,122 --> 02:04:55,122
And, reduced sentence
for Carmine Polito.

2221
02:04:57,170 --> 02:04:58,820
We'll get our two million dollars back.

2222
02:05:00,220 --> 02:05:02,320
That's interesting.
That's very interesting.

2223
02:05:03,090 --> 02:05:04,434
I have no idea.

2224
02:05:04,634 --> 02:05:07,129
No, idea why?
- Not, what you're talking about.

2225
02:05:07,329 --> 02:05:09,730
I get it.
I under-estimated you, right?

2226
02:05:10,670 --> 02:05:11,790
See, someone has leverage.

2227
02:05:12,420 --> 02:05:15,018
Anthony, fuck them.
Fuck them, it's over!

2228
02:05:15,218 --> 02:05:17,419
We got them or wire fraught.
It's over, you're both done!

2229
02:05:17,420 --> 02:05:19,490
I don't think so, i don't think so.
- Oh, you don't think so?

2230
02:05:20,080 --> 02:05:22,520
Richard, you requested the two million.

2231
02:05:23,360 --> 02:05:26,531
And, you gave Brenda
the account number.

2232
02:05:26,731 --> 02:05:27,731
We didn't do any of that.

2233
02:05:29,416 --> 02:05:31,071
None of it.

2234
02:05:31,710 --> 02:05:33,310
How do we know that,
You don't have the money?

2235
02:05:34,450 --> 02:05:37,893
Am I living in a fucking nightmare, right now?
- I find this a little offensive.

2236
02:05:38,320 --> 02:05:40,024
Really, I find this a little offensive.

2237
02:05:43,320 --> 02:05:45,940
Listen to me, we're dealing with
a very clever individual.

2238
02:05:46,140 --> 02:05:47,140
Richard.

2239
02:05:47,340 --> 02:05:50,087
Think about it, alright?

2240
02:05:50,520 --> 02:05:51,690
You had some big arrest.

2241
02:05:52,360 --> 02:05:54,985
Yeah, U.S congressmen.
You'll look good.

2242
02:05:55,185 --> 02:05:56,700
You're gonna be all over the news.

2243
02:05:57,820 --> 02:05:59,320
You know,
what doesn't look good?

2244
02:06:00,020 --> 02:06:02,315
Story about gross incompetence.

2245
02:06:02,515 --> 02:06:04,049
I have a warrant for,

2246
02:06:04,249 --> 02:06:06,209
sorry..do i have the wrong office?

2247
02:06:07,470 --> 02:06:08,730
This is 701..?

2248
02:06:09,480 --> 02:06:11,050
Alphonse Simone?
- This is 701.

2249
02:06:12,020 --> 02:06:15,295
My name is Roger Thickwen.
I've had this office for 25 years.

2250
02:06:15,495 --> 02:06:16,495
I'm a divorce attorney.

2251
02:06:21,230 --> 02:06:23,729
You lost 2 million dollars
of taxpayer money?

2252
02:06:23,730 --> 02:06:24,929
Because, you're confused,

2253
02:06:25,129 --> 02:06:28,311
about the location and the identity
of Victor Tellegio's attorney?

2254
02:06:29,270 --> 02:06:33,276
The role of Tellegio's attorney,
Alphonse Simone was played by our friend,

2255
02:06:33,476 --> 02:06:35,853
Ed Malone.
The cold cut king of Long Island.

2256
02:06:36,070 --> 02:06:37,290
Whose party, we were at.

2257
02:06:37,870 --> 02:06:39,300
When Sydney and I first met.

2258
02:06:39,920 --> 02:06:41,270
<i>Alphonse Simone</i>

2259
02:06:42,520 --> 02:06:44,150
People believe what
they wanna believe, Richie.

2260
02:06:44,940 --> 02:06:47,439
No, b'cos you conned me.
That's why. Because,

2261
02:06:47,440 --> 02:06:49,224
fucking conned me.
You did.

2262
02:06:49,424 --> 02:06:52,294
That, that doesn't sound
so good either.

2263
02:06:52,494 --> 02:06:53,860
Right there.
You know what i mean.

2264
02:06:54,060 --> 02:06:55,060
I don't know
what you're talking about.

2265
02:06:55,650 --> 02:06:57,710
But, let's just assume..
You wanna go with that story.

2266
02:06:58,350 --> 02:06:59,450
Really?

2267
02:07:00,190 --> 02:07:01,520
That's the story, you wanna go with?

2268
02:07:02,080 --> 02:07:05,390
Alright? That's what
you want the New York Times to hear.

2269
02:07:06,870 --> 02:07:08,870
That, you got conned..

2270
02:07:09,540 --> 02:07:12,060
By the very con men,

2271
02:07:12,560 --> 02:07:14,040
Who you 'forced'..

2272
02:07:14,630 --> 02:07:16,130
To entrap the members of congress.

2273
02:07:16,770 --> 02:07:17,970
In the first place.

2274
02:07:18,470 --> 02:07:19,804
That's what you wanna go with.

2275
02:07:20,004 --> 02:07:22,655
That doesn't sound so good,
for your whole thing.

2276
02:07:22,855 --> 02:07:23,855
Does it?

2277
02:07:24,410 --> 02:07:25,400
How ironic...

2278
02:07:26,640 --> 02:07:27,700
that the ones who're
working hardest.

2279
02:07:28,140 --> 02:07:30,810
To get, the economy of
New Jersey's going.

2280
02:07:32,130 --> 02:07:33,750
Those are the ones
you round up.

2281
02:07:35,170 --> 02:07:36,716
Why? Why..b'cos what.

2282
02:07:36,916 --> 02:07:37,916
They are the easiest
to go after?

2283
02:07:38,710 --> 02:07:40,920
What about the real bullshit artists?

2284
02:07:42,900 --> 02:07:45,391
You didn't even
come close to the big leagues.

2285
02:07:45,591 --> 02:07:47,707
Those big guys.
The money men.

2286
02:07:49,420 --> 02:07:51,000
That's what I was trying
to go after.

2287
02:07:51,700 --> 02:07:54,536
I'm sorry to telling you,
you got none of 'em.

2288
02:07:59,280 --> 02:08:00,950
You know Richard, i think uh..

2289
02:08:02,690 --> 02:08:04,748
We may call you as a witness.
But, otherwise you're done.

2290
02:08:04,948 --> 02:08:05,948
I think you better go home.

2291
02:08:07,485 --> 02:08:08,460
Stauton.

2292
02:08:08,660 --> 02:08:10,811
Go on home, Richard.

2293
02:08:25,749 --> 02:08:27,259
<i>We took down some very big guys.</i>

2294
02:08:27,459 --> 02:08:28,180
<i>Among some who..</i>

2295
02:08:28,810 --> 02:08:32,300
<i>They were just doing business as usual.
Helping their community, served their states.</i>

2296
02:08:33,100 --> 02:08:35,970
<i>But, some of them knew.
They have larceny in their blood.</i>

2297
02:08:36,740 --> 02:08:38,140
<i>May never admitted it.</i>

2298
02:08:38,470 --> 02:08:41,280
<i>But, in all..
Were Six Congressmen.</i>

2299
02:08:41,740 --> 02:08:42,790
<i>One United States Senator.</i>

2300
02:08:44,350 --> 02:08:47,436
<i>And my friend, Carmine Polito.</i>

2301
02:08:50,690 --> 02:08:51,920
<i>We gave the two million back.</i>

2302
02:08:52,690 --> 02:08:54,260
<i>So, Carmine got a reduced sentence.</i>

2303
02:08:54,810 --> 02:08:56,270
<i>18 months.</i>

2304
02:08:57,090 --> 02:08:59,480
<i>The lost of his friendship...</i>

2305
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,568
<i>..will haunt me for the rest of my life.</i>

2306
02:09:06,551 --> 02:09:08,175
<i>When the story was written,</i>

2307
02:09:08,870 --> 02:09:10,180
<i>Richie DiMaso's name..</i>

2308
02:09:10,590 --> 02:09:12,060
<i>...was never mentioned.</i>

2309
02:09:24,520 --> 02:09:25,770
<i>Syd and I,
we moved in together.</i>

2310
02:09:27,860 --> 02:09:29,110
<i>Rosalyn...</i>

2311
02:09:29,980 --> 02:09:33,125
The car is a little dinked up.
I'm a little stiff..but..

2312
02:09:33,325 --> 02:09:35,826
Whatever, I don't wanna talk
about it.

2313
02:09:36,026 --> 02:09:38,741
She will always be interesting.

2314
02:09:40,220 --> 02:09:42,070
You know, my boss
knows you did him a solid.

2315
02:09:42,440 --> 02:09:43,755
Yes, I did.

2316
02:09:43,955 --> 02:09:44,955
We never took any records.

2317
02:09:46,630 --> 02:09:49,101
I was never gona let that happen.

2318
02:09:49,301 --> 02:09:50,580
Irv?

2319

<i>You can fool yourself
for just so long.</i>

2323
02:10:17,350 --> 02:10:21,000
<i>Then, you're next re-invention
better have your damn feet on the ground.</i>

2324
02:10:24,930 --> 02:10:27,920
<i>We got a loan from a bank.
And, we're able to go a gellary legitimate.</i>

2325
02:10:30,200 --> 02:10:31,690
<i>The art of survival...</i>

2326
02:10:32,270 --> 02:10:33,470
<i>..is a story that never ends.</i>
