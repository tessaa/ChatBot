1
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:34,080
Baby, check this out.

2
00:01:34,199 --> 00:01:36,120
A power washer?

3
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,080
We need one of these.

4
00:01:38,199 --> 00:01:39,080
Yeah.

5
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,000
On the patio in the backyard.

6
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:41,160
Yeah.

7
00:01:41,199 --> 00:01:43,040
Should we go look at
those window treatments?

8
00:01:43,199 --> 00:01:44,120
No.

9
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:46,360
Do you want one of these hotdogs?

10
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
They're very good.

11
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:52,000
Baby, you are a heck of a homemaker.

12
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,040
You know that?

13
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,120
But we could just go to dinner.

14
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,120
Well, you know...

15
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,040
if you don't make it...

16
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:04,120
You don't eat it.

17
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,120
You know what? That's a great idea.

18
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,241
What if I make you dinner?

19
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:12,040
I'm gonna go and get that
grill. The big shiny one.

20
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:15,040
Will you get us some
shrimp? The big jumbo kind.

21
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,200
4 down. 3 over.

22
00:02:18,119 --> 00:02:20,200
Come back and find me down here. In tools.

23
00:02:24,119 --> 00:02:25,960
What the hell are you doing here?

24
00:02:28,119 --> 00:02:30,000
You ignored my messages.

25
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,080
I am happy.

26
00:02:31,119 --> 00:02:32,120
You're desperate.

27
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:33,160
I can make this work.

28
00:02:33,999 --> 00:02:35,120
You're playing house.

29
00:02:35,999 --> 00:02:39,080
Look, I'm retired. I'm
happy. We are happy.

30
00:02:39,119 --> 00:02:41,000
Frank...

31
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43,160
You haven't killed anybody in months.

32
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,080
That is not a bad thing.

33
00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:48,080
That's a positive thing
for a lot of people.

34
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:51,000
Kemosabe, I need you.
They're coming. I can feel it.

35
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,160
You are driving me nuts, Marvin.

36
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,080
If it makes you feel
better, bring the girl.

37
00:02:55,119 --> 00:02:56,120
I'm not gonna bring the girl anywhere.

38
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,000
Don't bring the girl where?

39
00:02:59,999 --> 00:03:01,160
We're just catching up.

40
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,120
Marvin's here. I just bumped into Marvin.

41
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:04,080
Where are we going?

42
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,080
No, come on. They're gonna close.

43
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:07,120
Good to see you, Marvin.

44
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,120
Good to see you.

45
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:10,120
Frank.

46
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,040
You know you want to.

47
00:03:14,119 --> 00:03:15,040
No.

48
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,040
Come on.

49
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,080
Last chance, Frank.

50
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,040
I'm taking Sarah home.

51
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,040
Stay safe.

52
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,000
Well, I really wanted to be...

53
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,080
Of course, it is, honey.

54
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:30,040
You are never gonna be
in danger ever again.

55
00:03:43,999 --> 00:03:45,320
We don't even know what happened.

56
00:03:45,999 --> 00:03:47,199
We don't know who's in there.

57
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,040
How am I gonna protect you?

58
00:03:55,999 --> 00:03:58,040
Hey. He was your best friend.

59
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:02,120
Come on.

60
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,200
Wow.

61
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,160
He still looks so lifelike.

62
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,040
He's not dead.

63
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,000
Don't do that. Just let your feelings out.

64
00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:39,080
No. Really.

65
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,040
He does this a lot.

66
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,080
Really?

67
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,000
No, come on. Give me the pin.

68
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,200
Come on, sweetie. Let's go sit down.

69
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,120
I should kiss him.

70
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,200
Go ahead. Do you want to?

71
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:19,200
Let's go sit down. Come on, sweetie.

72
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,080
At this time, we'll open
the floor to anyone...

73
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:30,080
who wishes to say a few
words about the deceased.

74
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,040
Babe...

75
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,000
Share a memory, perhaps?

76
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,000
Perhaps, a poem. A song lyric.

77
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,160
Anyone?

78
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:43,040
You can do it.

79
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Sir?

80
00:06:03,159 --> 00:06:06,080
Marvin was...

81
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,000
different.

82
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,120
He was...

83
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,080
a very good shot.

84
00:06:15,159 --> 00:06:17,000
Some would say that...

85
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,120
he was paranoid.

86
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,120
But you have to expect a little of that...

87
00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:25,160
when the CIA's dosing you with LSD...

88
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,040
for a little more than a decade.

89
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,120
He could wire a bomb...

90
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:34,160
faster than anybody I ever met.

91
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,040
The good people of Moldova will always...

92
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,120
be in Marvin's debt.

93
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,960
He was a really good friend.

94
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:54,200
Really good.

95
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:57,120
I'm gonna miss him.

96
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:59,160
Gonna miss him.

97
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,000
We have to move.

98
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:02,539
Canada?

99
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,960
High ground. Good kill
zones. It's a little farm.

100
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:09,960
A farm? Like, to farm on?

101
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,200
Like, with crops?

102
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,080
Yeah. It could be fun.

103
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,000
Listen, babe...

104
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,120
You know they say it's really
important not to make big...

105
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:22,160
life altering decisions
right after a loss.

106
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,080
If they can get to Marvin, they can
get to you and they can get to me.

107
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,200
Who are they?

108
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,840
Go to the safe house.

109
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,160
Look at me.

110
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,200
Go to the safe house.

111
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'll come find you.

112
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,200
I'm not leaving you.

113
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,120
It'll be alright.

114
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:43,960
What is it?

115
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,960
Mr. Moses...

116
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,960
They want to debrief you
at a Yankee White facility.

117
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:49,040
Is that your sniper?

118
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,040
You're flagged Retired
Extremely Dangerous.

119
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,080
YANKEE WHITE FACILITY

120
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:06,080
Hi there.

121
00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:09,000
My client Frank Moses is here.

122
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,000
He's an American citizen being
detained illegally without due process.

123
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,158
That is a lovely blazer.

124
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:13,160
Thank you.
That is a lovely blazer.

125
00:08:13,161 --> 00:08:14,000
Thank you.

126
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,960
You're welcome.

127
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,160
Sorry, I have no idea. But
let me get Mr. Snyder for you.

128
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,120
Thank you.

129
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,160
How can I help you?

130
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,040
Hi there. What is your name?

131
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,000
John Snyder.

132
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:29,120
John. I didn't get your name.

133
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:30,040
It's Kelly.

134
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,000
Hi, Kelly.

135
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,080
John...

136
00:08:35,119 --> 00:08:36,080
John...

137
00:08:36,119 --> 00:08:38,120
Unless you want to end up like Kelly...

138
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,240
I suggest you tell me where
Frank Moses is right now.

139
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:42,960
Now!

140
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,960
In interrogation.

141
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,160
I got a document right
here that says that...

142
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,120
you have a special
interest in the Cold War.

143
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,040
We know that back in the day,
you spent a lotta time in Russia.

144
00:08:54,999 --> 00:08:57,319
I just need to know what you
know about Project Nightshade.

145
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,480
I really don't know anything about it.

146
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,000
What the hell is that?

147
00:09:07,119 --> 00:09:09,160
Small arms gunfire, 200 yards.

148
00:09:11,119 --> 00:09:12,000
Watch him.

149
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,040
100 yards.

150
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,000
They're coming to kill us.

151
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,120
Get me outta these cuffs.

152
00:09:19,999 --> 00:09:21,080
I can't do that, sir.

153
00:09:21,119 --> 00:09:22,160
You have the key, right?

154
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:25,499
Hands up!

155
00:09:26,119 --> 00:09:27,080
50 feet.

156
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,960
They're gonna kill us both, if
you don't get me outta these cuffs.

157
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,960
Come on.

158
00:09:46,999 --> 00:09:48,160
Frank Moses.

159
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,080
Coming up through the
ranks, you were my hero.

160
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,080
Given enough time, I
guess everyone cracks.

161
00:09:56,999 --> 00:09:58,080
Frank.

162
00:10:00,999 --> 00:10:01,160
Who are you?

163
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,120
Me?

164
00:10:03,119 --> 00:10:05,200
I'm the guy the government
hires to get information.

165
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:09,160
And I'm allowed to use any
form of torture I deem fit.

166
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,040
And I will torture Sarah until you speak.

167
00:10:15,999 --> 00:10:16,960
Speaking of Sarah...

168
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,080
I love watching her...

169
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,040
shave her legs in the tub.

170
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,080
Kinda reminds me of these
Belgian mercs I met in the Congo.

171
00:10:26,999 --> 00:10:31,080
They would skin people
alive to get them to talk.

172
00:10:31,119 --> 00:10:32,519
And do you know where they started?

173
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,080
Guess.

174
00:10:37,119 --> 00:10:41,120
At the ankles. Just like your Sarah.

175
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,000
So...

176
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,080
you either give me the
information that I need to know...

177
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,960
Or I'm gonna filet your girl
from head to toe with no mercy.

178
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,200
Awesome.

179
00:11:15,999 --> 00:11:16,960
Wow.

180
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,079
Pretty good for a retired guy. But are you

181
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,120
1 2 3 4 5 6...

182
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,080
7 on 1 cuffed with no weapon good?

183
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,080
Son of a

184
00:11:28,119 --> 00:11:30,120
Go. Go go go!

185
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,280
Shoot him, but don't kill him.

186
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:40,239
Alright, kill him. Spray it up.

187
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,120
Frank, this is your last chance.

188
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,080
Fire.

189
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,120
Get in there! Go!

190
00:13:34,119 --> 00:13:35,080
Shit.

191
00:13:56,999 --> 00:13:57,499
Marvin!

192
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,120
You're driving me crazy!

193
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,040
I brought the key.

194
00:14:03,999 --> 00:14:05,080
You faked your death.

195
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,120
Gotta go.

196
00:14:07,999 --> 00:14:08,499
Let's go.

197
00:14:08,999 --> 00:14:09,499
Gotta go.

198
00:14:10,999 --> 00:14:12,639
You have no idea what you put me through!

199
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,000
Thank God, you're okay.

200
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:19,540
No!

201
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,160
What are you doing here?

202
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,960
Marvin brought me. From the house.

203
00:14:25,119 --> 00:14:27,120
Has everybody lost their mind?

204
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,080
You don't bring a girl like that here.

205
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,359
I had to see if you were okay.

206
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,160
Honey!

207
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,120
I thought...

208
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,080
What?

209
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,200
Remember when we discussed
how you were gonna lay low?

210
00:14:38,999 --> 00:14:40,479
You don't get to tell me when to lay.

211
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,120
I'm not saying that.

212
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,120
Stop. Just don't.

213
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,000
You're mad at me now?

214
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,160
You treat me like a China doll.

215
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,960
Frank, can I give you a
little advice about women?

216
00:14:51,999 --> 00:14:53,120
Absolutely not!

217
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:58,040
Ask yourself, what is a girl like
that doing with a guy like you?

218
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,120
It ain't for your looks.

219
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,080
I will shoot you. I will
shoot you in the liver.

220
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,160
A, R, D, A.

221
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,960
Adventure, romance, danger...

222
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,080
activities you can share as a couple.

223
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:13,160
It's about you lying to me.

224
00:15:13,999 --> 00:15:15,000
Frank...

225
00:15:15,119 --> 00:15:19,160
I was very touched that
you cried at my funeral.

226
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,160
That's not true.

227
00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:32,160
I didn't cy at your funeral.

228
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,040
I'm no crier.

229
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:44,040
96 hours ago, somebody posted
a document on the internet...

230
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,120
that said you and I took part in
an operation called Nightshade...

231
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,960
back in '79.

232
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,080
That's why you fake died?

233
00:15:50,119 --> 00:15:53,000
Yeah. The chatter went through the roof.

234
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,080
So everybody's after you...

235
00:15:55,119 --> 00:15:58,960
for something they think you know
that you don't even know at all?

236
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,160
Oh my God! Spiders!

237
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,160
Honey, you need to go to ground
and it's best I don't know where.

238
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,120
Yeah, I'm not going anywhere.

239
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,040
Cash only. No calls.

240
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,000
No contacts.

241
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:12,960
Thanks. Look...

242
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,120
I'm not hanging out in some bunker...

243
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,120
while you slink around
and save the planet...

244
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,000
with dusky international femme fatales.

245
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,000
Dusky?

246
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,080
Dark, smoldering.

247
00:16:23,119 --> 00:16:24,279
I know what it means. Marvin.

248
00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:30,160
It's hard to be the kinda
person I have to be right now...

249
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,000
and do the kinda things that
I'm going to have to do...

250
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,080
while you're here.

251
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,000
This is gonna be good for us.

252
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,120
What are we doing?

253
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,160
Face it, Columbo, things
were getting a little stale.

254
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,160
Wow. Mommy just slapped
Daddy at the dinner table.

255
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,040
Is there a human being in the trunk?

256
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,000
Yeah.

257
00:16:55,999 --> 00:16:57,200
Who is it? Marvin

258
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:03,000
He's a Senior Director
of Military Intelligence.

259
00:17:03,119 --> 00:17:06,160
I've been caramelizing his
onions for a couple of days.

260
00:17:06,999 --> 00:17:08,080
Caramelizing how?

261
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,160
With three tabs of acid and a lot of rats.

262
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,160
Dang!

263
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:15,120
THE PENTAGON

264
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,000
11 people dead.

265
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,040
5 FBI.

266
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,120
And the SecDef wants a briefing?

267
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,960
You were brought in to contain this.

268
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,160
Calm down.

269
00:17:24,999 --> 00:17:27,040
I can't believe this is coming
back on me after so many years.

270
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,080
General, Moses and Boggs
have been completely isolated.

271
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,000
The FBI is seeking them for the murders.

272
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:35,040
Homeland has been informed that they
are officially domestic terrorists.

273
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:36,960
Is that gonna work?

274
00:17:36,999 --> 00:17:37,499
Yes.

275
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:41,160
The problem is with that document
surfacing on the internet...

276
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:44,040
all the players will be
coming after Nightshade.

277
00:17:48,999 --> 00:17:50,159
It'll open the book on this.

278
00:17:50,999 --> 00:17:53,160
I'm calling SecDef. We need to go public.

279
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,040
General...

280
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:05,040
Nobody's going public.

281
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:08,000
We need a new plan for Moses.

282
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:10,000
I need you to approve a specialist.

283
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:11,040
What? CIA?

284
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:14,000
It's been tried, sir. Didn't
work so well for those guys.

285
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:18,080
Han Cho Bai. He's the best.

286
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,080
Do it.

287
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:22,960
HONG KONG

288
00:18:41,999 --> 00:18:43,000
Suit, too.

289
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,080
He's clean.

290
00:18:56,999 --> 00:18:58,000
Seriously?

291
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,040
Sit down, Mr. Han.

292
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:29,000
Your security is impressive.

293
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,040
A business associate.

294
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,080
Julio Alvarez Fernandes.

295
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,160
Very difficult to get close to.

296
00:19:39,999 --> 00:19:42,040
Of course, it must
appear like an accident.

297
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,960
Not a problem. Except for one thing.

298
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,040
Mr. Fernandes pays better.

299
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,460
Yeah?

300
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:14,759
Who's the target?

301
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,080
It's an old pal of yours. Frank Moses.

302
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,960
Karma's a bitch, Frank.

303
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,000
HEADQUARTERS MI6 LONDON

304
00:20:36,999 --> 00:20:37,960
What is this?

305
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:40,000
There's a watchword flag
on a WikiLeaks document.

306
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:41,960
It's coded Priority One Alpha Seven.

307
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,120
Something called Nightshade.

308
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,120
Shut up!

309
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,080
Get out.

310
00:20:54,999 --> 00:20:57,000
Find me Victoria Winslow.

311
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,040
Director Philips?

312
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:13,000
I'm with someone right now.

313
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,040
Keeping busy, I see.

314
00:21:24,999 --> 00:21:26,960
Idle hands do the Devil's work.

315
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,160
Yes.

316
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,960
I understand you can
get close to Frank Moses.

317
00:21:34,999 --> 00:21:35,960
Yes.

318
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,040
MI6 has a job for you.

319
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,000
If you want to stay alive,
you're going to accept it.

320
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,120
It's time to choose sides, Victoria.

321
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,160
Where do they teach you guys this stuff?

322
00:21:54,999 --> 00:21:57,000
Manuals, mostly.

323
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:02,080
Some of this stuff you just can't teach.

324
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,040
Wow.

325
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,040
Isn't this cool?

326
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:08,239
We're on a mission together.

327
00:22:08,999 --> 00:22:11,000
Do you have any idea how many
people are tying to kill us?

328
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,000
We both know this is where you belong.

329
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:16,040
Right here. In the thick of it.

330
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:17,200
Pussy Cat's right, Frank.

331
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,080
Here we go.

332
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,120
Watch your step.

333
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,120
Come on!

334
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,160
Where did you get this?

335
00:22:29,999 --> 00:22:31,000
Marvin.

336
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,160
You gave her a gun?

337
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,040
It is America.

338
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,080
Everyone else has a gun.

339
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:43,040
She has no idea what to do with this.

340
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,481
I know exactly what to do with it.

341
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:58,000
You don't give fire to a kitten.

342
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,160
Why don't you just give her some dynamite?

343
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,960
No external safety on the Sig?

344
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:13,960
Tell him what you told me.

345
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:15,040
At the height of the Cold War...

346
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:17,120
Nightshade was cooked up
by a rogue US general...

347
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,080
as a first strike capability
against the Soviets.

348
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,960
That's it. Can I go?

349
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:23,120
You want a little pepper with that?

350
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,040
At the height of the Cold War...

351
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:28,080
a megaton yield device
was smuggled into Moscow...

352
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,040
in diplomatic pouches, piece by piece...

353
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:32,040
and then the weapon was lost. That's it.

354
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,000
You lost a nuke in Moscow?

355
00:23:34,999 --> 00:23:38,160
The scientist was
Edward Bailey. That's it.

356
00:23:42,999 --> 00:23:43,960
What?

357
00:23:44,999 --> 00:23:45,960
I made a mistake.

358
00:23:46,999 --> 00:23:49,120
Edward Bailey was a genius physicist...

359
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,960
who built some of the greatest
stuff during the Cold War.

360
00:23:52,999 --> 00:23:56,000
Neutron bombs, particle
beam weapons, nerve gas.

361
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:57,160
Excellent nerve gas.

362
00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:02,080
He was a rock star of
conceptual mass killing.

363
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,040
They called him "The Da Vinci of Death".

364
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,080
We were the security detail...

365
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,000
assigned to getting him in
and out of Moscow safely.

366
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,040
What happened?

367
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,000
We thought he was secure.

368
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:15,960
The Soviets got him with a car bomb.

369
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,040
It was my fault.

370
00:24:19,999 --> 00:24:20,960
He's dead.

371
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,960
Run or fight?

372
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:30,960
All we've got is this
WikiLeaks page off the internet.

373
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,160
Out of a Paris IP.

374
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:38,000
Paris could be anybody.

375
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:41,000
Wait. Scroll back down for a second.

376
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,120
What is that?

377
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,000
Coffee stain?

378
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,080
Wine.

379
00:24:51,999 --> 00:24:52,960
Frog.

380
00:24:54,999 --> 00:24:55,499
What?

381
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,080
We're okay.

382
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:07,000
Your number.

383
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,120
Yeah.

384
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:14,000
MI6 has just given me
a contract to kill you.

385
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:16,960
Apparently, you're guilty of
nuclear terrorism, murder...

386
00:25:16,999 --> 00:25:19,120
and you're number one on
Interpol's Most Wanted.

387
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:21,040
What did you say?

388
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:22,080
I said "Yes."

389
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,160
The money's good. And if I
don't do it, somebody else will.

390
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,120
You should know the Americans
are sending someone also.

391
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,120
Who?

392
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:31,000
Han.

393
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,000
It's bad, isn't it?

394
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:34,960
Is that Marvin?

395
00:25:34,999 --> 00:25:36,000
Yes. And Sarah.

396
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:37,000
Send them my love.

397
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,120
They're driving me crazy.

398
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,160
Marvin gave her a gun.

399
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,160
Was it loaded?

400
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,160
Yes!

401
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,160
Are you being controlling?

402
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,120
No!

403
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,080
You have to take chances
in a relationship.

404
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,000
You have to be supportive.

405
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,281
I don't need her to fit in.
I just need her to be safe.

406
00:25:53,999 --> 00:25:56,000
Just rent "Dirty Dancing",
tell her you love her.

407
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:00,000
It's important to enjoy
life while you still can.

408
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:07,160
Victoria just accepted a contract
from MI6 to kill all 3 of us.

409
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:12,120
You don't think she'd do that, do you?

410
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,120
She's a friend.

411
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,160
Are you stupid? You never took
a contract out to kill a friend?

412
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,080
She called to give us fair warning.

413
00:26:19,999 --> 00:26:22,040
Come on. There's one more thing.

414
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:26,120
Han just went number one.

415
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:30,080
Why don't they just
dip our balls in honey...

416
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,960
and stake us to an ant farm?

417
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,000
Come on.

418
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,120
Whoa!

419
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,000
Crazy old bastard.

420
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,040
Frank, do you feel old?

421
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,080
Not really.

422
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,080
Me neither.

423
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,080
Crazy sometimes, I guess.

424
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,120
Who's Han?

425
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,080
Who's Han?

426
00:26:54,999 --> 00:26:57,040
Korean. Counter intel.

427
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,000
Frank put him in jail for a few years.

428
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:01,119
We should be super scared of him?

429
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,120
Yes. He is the best
contract killer in the world.

430
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:18,160
I've got a hit off an old alias,
silent for almost 20 years.

431
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,040
He's dodging watch lists.

432
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:26,000
Bingo. Private flight to Paris
scheduled for 0900 out of Teterboro.

433
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:30,080
Find their hotel. Get blueprints and
workups on the day and night managers.

434
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,360
Have Vance meet us on the ground.

435
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:40,080
TETERBORO, NEW JERSEY

436
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:46,040
They're 1 floor down. 2 adjoining rooms.

437
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:47,599
Surveillance is almost up and running.

438
00:27:48,999 --> 00:27:51,040
This is going to be easier than I thought.

439
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:56,040
Hello. Speaking.

440
00:27:58,039 --> 00:27:59,040
Yes.

441
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:00,719
Where are they?

442
00:28:00,999 --> 00:28:03,080
They were here. They ordered
room service at 1 o'clock.

443
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,120
What do you mean "The plane is prepped"?

444
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,040
I think someone stole your plane.

445
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,000
I'm really going to enjoy killing him.

446
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,120
Get me a gun that really hurts.

447
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,998
How good is this guy?

448
00:28:31,999 --> 00:28:32,000
Han is the best contract
killer in the world. How good is this guy?

449
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:35,040
Han is the best contract
killer in the world.

450
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:39,159
Frank is in some very deep dog doo.

451
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,960
He's not gonna kill me.

452
00:28:40,999 --> 00:28:43,000
Yeah. Nobody kills Frank Moses.

453
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:43,579
Right!

454
00:28:43,999 --> 00:28:47,040
The people he really doesn't like,
he tortures for a long time first.

455
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:49,160
Can we just focus on
tying to catch The Frog?

456
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,160
What's the action plan for
target acquisition and rendition?

457
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:55,000
Marvin?

458
00:28:55,999 --> 00:28:57,120
Quit teaching her stuff!

459
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,000
Nice.

460
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,120
What do you think the most ex pensive
bottle of wine in the world costs?

461
00:29:06,999 --> 00:29:09,000
Chateau d'Yquem 1847.

462
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:13,160
Maybe 5, 6 bottles left in
the world. It's pretty pricey.

463
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,960
Maybe we should get a bottle and
ty to catch The Frog with it.

464
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,160
PARIS

465
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,960
My God, this is so romantic!

466
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,160
Come here. Keep your head down.

467
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:36,000
But we have to go to the
le Saint Louis for gelato.

468
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,120
I don't think so.

469
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,080
Really? What about the...

470
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:49,160
Frank, is that?

471
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,120
Hello, Frank.

472
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,160
Have you seen her since?

473
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,120
Nope.

474
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,960
God, I've missed you.

475
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,160
Who is she?

476
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:00,040
Trouble.

477
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:09,160
How are things?

478
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,040
Yeah, Frank, how are things?

479
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,160
Sarah...

480
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,200
This is Katia.

481
00:30:16,999 --> 00:30:18,080
Yeah. Hi.

482
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,120
I need to speak with you. Immediately.

483
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,120
What the hell was that?

484
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:28,080
Katja Petrokovich. Russian
Counter Intelligence.

485
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,000
I think we should hear
what she has to say.

486
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,000
Frank...

487
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,000
You don't know the half of it.

488
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:37,200
She and Frank were young.

489
00:30:37,999 --> 00:30:41,960
He didn't have the slightest idea
she was working for the Russians.

490
00:30:41,999 --> 00:30:44,200
She's Frank Moses' kryptonite.

491
00:30:52,999 --> 00:30:54,160
I like you with no hair.

492
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,000
Bald men are so sexy. Virile.

493
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:01,120
Wow.

494
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:05,000
She's cute. Where did
you find her? Nebraska?

495
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:06,120
Kansas.

496
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,960
Kansas.

497
00:31:11,999 --> 00:31:14,120
So what was it you wanted
to talk to me about?

498
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,159
I would like to believe
that the US didn't plant...

499
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,200
a weapon of mass destruction
in Moscow. But I don't.

500
00:31:21,999 --> 00:31:23,120
Why are you in Paris?

501
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:26,160
We come evey fall for Strike
Season and for the weather.

502
00:31:27,999 --> 00:31:30,120
The US seems to think
you're nuclear terrorists.

503
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:34,160
Russia wants complete access.

504
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:39,040
You agree now or I'll hand
you over to the US government.

505
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,080
Can't we just kill her?

506
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,000
Excuse me for one second.

507
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:46,160
Can I talk to you?

508
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,120
What? Uh huh. Sure thing.

509
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,200
I was shocked.

510
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,241
I know. She was kinda counting
your teeth with her tongue.

511
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,080
A little, yeah.

512
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,120
Can she go now?

513
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:07,960
We don't really have a
choice. We need her to help us.

514
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:10,160
I promise there is nothing between us.

515
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:15,080
No, sir. This guy's
not giving us anything.

516
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,040
Website's been scrubbed.

517
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,160
NSA intercepted a dispatch
to the Kremlin from Paris.

518
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,040
Moses is going after
someone called "The Frog".

519
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:26,080
The Frog.

520
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:32,080
So they call him "The
Frog" because he's French?

521
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:37,080
No. He poisoned the water
supply at KGB headquarters...

522
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:40,120
with the Amazon tree frog poison.

523
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,160
He must have been wiping those
little tree humpers for years.

524
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,160
Incapacitated 1600 people and
left with evey secret we had.

525
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:53,080
The guy makes a fortune
selling information.

526
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:56,000
He knows so much even
the US won't touch him.

527
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,160
The hard part is gonna
be taking him alive.

528
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:22,000
Superb.

529
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:23,080
Wine is wine.

530
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,160
I want to buy American
air defense protocols.

531
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:30,000
Why is it terrorists
never appreciate Burgundy?

532
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:32,040
I don't think you know
who you're dealing with.

533
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:40,080
PLACE BID

534
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,080
SOLD

535
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,080
Confirmed. It's him. It's the Frog.

536
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:48,319
Just don't look at him, right?

537
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:51,040
Just act natural.

538
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:54,080
And don't look him right in the eyes.

539
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,040
Check.

540
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,080
Remember, don't look right at him.

541
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:58,000
Marvin, you alright?

542
00:34:58,079 --> 00:34:58,579
Yeah.

543
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,960
Get her outta here.

544
00:34:59,999 --> 00:35:00,080
When?

545
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:01,040
Now!

546
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:03,000
Get a car!

547
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:51,040
Is that?

548
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,521
Cut them off!

549
00:35:56,039 --> 00:35:57,120
This is not a good idea!

550
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:59,000
She's not gonna get there first!

551
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:00,000
Sidewalk!

552
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:09,200
Watch the curb!

553
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:13,200
Yes!

554
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:19,040
Happy trails, bozo!

555
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,160
Don't you think we should let...

556
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:24,040
Shut your pie hole, Marvin!

557
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:38,160
Don't you think we should let...

558
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:39,200
Hush!

559
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:43,120
Incoming!

560
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:49,000
Bastard! Sidewalk!

561
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:53,960
What the?

562
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:57,120
She's fine.

563
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:00,120
Got him.

564
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:17,120
What are you doing?

565
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,000
Got him.

566
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,960
Look! What is she doing?

567
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:24,000
I'm begging

568
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:25,080
Yeah, yeah. I got this.

569
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,000
I so got this.

570
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,040
I hate her so much.

571
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:03,960
You're wasting your time!

572
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:15,040
You're going to regret this more
than you can possibly imagine.

573
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,040
You know who we are?

574
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:21,200
Yes, of course.

575
00:38:22,039 --> 00:38:23,120
Tell us about Nightshade.

576
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:27,080
You think I'm going to roll
over for you hegemonic...

577
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:30,120
Mickey Mouse loving Americans?

578
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:32,040
Leave Mickey out of it.

579
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:34,160
1947 Petrus?

580
00:38:34,999 --> 00:38:36,160
Yes. That one's rather...

581
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:38,120
God's sake!

582
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,080
Wait wait wait! That bottle!

583
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:44,080
How do we find it?

584
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:45,080
Never!

585
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:48,160
Nightshade was the plot of lunatics.

586
00:38:50,039 --> 00:38:51,080
I used to be like you.

587
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,080
Driven by ideology and fear...

588
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:55,200
with no love of what's
beautiful in the world.

589
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:58,160
I can't trust animals like you!

590
00:39:00,999 --> 00:39:02,040
Do what you will.

591
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:04,080
Death is easy.

592
00:39:04,999 --> 00:39:07,160
It's not about the
destination. It's about the journey.

593
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,960
Death is an art form in Russia.

594
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:15,120
There are so many ways
to take a man to bits.

595
00:39:15,999 --> 00:39:18,160
Shall we start with a Chechen
facelift? Hold him down!

596
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,960
Stop! Stop it!

597
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:22,120
This is how we do it.

598
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:26,080
Please. You're so brave.

599
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:30,000
But you have to understand...

600
00:39:30,039 --> 00:39:34,040
we're doing this for the
right reasons. And this...

601
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:39,120
This isn't worth your life.

602
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,000
You must have something to live for.

603
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:49,120
Art.

604
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:52,080
Wine.

605
00:39:54,999 --> 00:39:56,120
Women?

606
00:39:56,199 --> 00:39:57,160
Hey.

607
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:04,120
Help us.

608
00:40:05,999 --> 00:40:07,120
We need this information.

609
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,080
You'll be helping us
save the world. Please.

610
00:40:19,999 --> 00:40:21,040
You, I'll help.

611
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:24,040
Excuse me.

612
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,000
Thank you.

613
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:38,040
And you can suck it.

614
00:40:39,159 --> 00:40:41,000
Baby? Honey?

615
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:44,080
Seriously? You hooked up with that?

616
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:48,200
What a woman.

617
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:52,160
Is that the same dress?

618
00:40:54,039 --> 00:40:55,120
They look the same to you?

619
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:04,000
No one ever called me
Frank Moses' kryptonite.

620
00:41:04,999 --> 00:41:06,040
Frank's crazy about you.

621
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:09,040
I've never seen him afraid
of anything except losing you.

622
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:14,120
What if I'm ruining his life?

623
00:41:16,999 --> 00:41:20,120
Frank is a very simple
creature with very simple needs.

624
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:22,120
It's killing...

625
00:41:22,999 --> 00:41:23,960
eating...

626
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:26,160
sexting...

627
00:41:26,999 --> 00:41:28,160
eating...

628
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:31,080
Killing, I guess.

629
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:32,960
What's your point?

630
00:41:33,999 --> 00:41:36,040
I can't believe you kissed The Frog.

631
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:38,200
Well, I've kissed a lotta frogs.

632
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:41,120
I got something for ya.

633
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:42,120
What is it?

634
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:45,040
The key to The Frog's
security deposit box.

635
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:46,080
From?

636
00:41:46,119 --> 00:41:48,000
Credit Lyonnais.

637
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:56,200
Baby, I have a request.

638
00:41:59,159 --> 00:42:03,200
How would you feel about going
out to dinner with me tonight?

639
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:09,080
It is Paris, after all.

640
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:11,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

641
00:42:15,999 --> 00:42:17,199
Stay here. I'll be right back.

642
00:42:29,999 --> 00:42:31,120
I need you, Frank.

643
00:42:32,039 --> 00:42:33,080
It's not a good time.

644
00:42:34,039 --> 00:42:37,000
One of our old assets
has some real information.

645
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,080
He needs to meet with us right now.

646
00:42:40,999 --> 00:42:41,499
Nah.

647
00:42:43,039 --> 00:42:45,080
Frank, what are you
doing? She's kryptonite.

648
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,000
I'll handle it.

649
00:42:47,079 --> 00:42:48,040
Are you sure?

650
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:52,000
Yeah.

651
00:42:54,999 --> 00:42:58,080
It's not okay. It's just
some work. No, it's not fun.

652
00:42:58,119 --> 00:43:01,040
Go. You and Svetlana work it out.

653
00:43:01,159 --> 00:43:05,960
I promise you that I will
be back in time for dinner.

654
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:09,080
I'll be back.

655
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:15,080
Keep her safe.

656
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:24,160
What happened to us, Frank?

657
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:26,120
Well...

658
00:43:26,199 --> 00:43:31,120
You betrayed me. You set
me up. Tried to kill me.

659
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:33,160
I tried to kill you.

660
00:43:34,999 --> 00:43:37,000
They were good times, weren't they?

661
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:41,120
If you'd asked me to betray my
county, you know I would have.

662
00:43:45,079 --> 00:43:46,040
Yes, madam.

663
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,120
My God.

664
00:43:51,999 --> 00:43:55,000
You know, I looked you up once.

665
00:43:55,999 --> 00:43:58,080
You were in a bungalow in Los Angeles.

666
00:43:58,999 --> 00:44:01,040
There were roses out in front.

667
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:04,000
But I lost my nerve.

668
00:44:14,999 --> 00:44:18,000
So what do you want?

669
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:22,960
It was all about work with you. Rules.

670
00:44:22,999 --> 00:44:24,080
Not rules.

671
00:44:24,999 --> 00:44:26,120
Right and wrong.

672
00:44:26,999 --> 00:44:31,960
It's harder for me not to follow orders.

673
00:44:32,199 --> 00:44:34,960
Despite my personal feelings.

674
00:44:36,039 --> 00:44:39,000
But feelings don't matter
any more than right or wrong.

675
00:44:40,999 --> 00:44:43,000
Orders matter.

676
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:44,960
Orders?

677
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:47,160
Russia will handle things from here.

678
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:50,040
I'm taking the key.

679
00:44:52,039 --> 00:44:53,160
I can't let that happen.

680
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:55,080
No?

681
00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:06,960
I can't feel my arms.

682
00:45:11,999 --> 00:45:13,080
Enjoy Kansas.

683
00:45:26,999 --> 00:45:27,960
He's out.

684
00:45:31,159 --> 00:45:33,000
He might be awake.

685
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:34,120
Good. So he can feel it.

686
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:39,160
Did you ever, ever in your entire career...

687
00:45:39,999 --> 00:45:42,000
let yourself get drugged?

688
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:44,160
I just don't like her!

689
00:45:46,039 --> 00:45:47,160
And now she has the key!

690
00:45:47,999 --> 00:45:51,000
She doesn't have the key. She has a key.

691
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:51,960
What?

692
00:45:52,159 --> 00:45:56,040
I knew she would play him like
a banjo at an Ozark hoedown.

693
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:57,200
So I have the key.

694
00:45:59,159 --> 00:46:01,040
Water.

695
00:46:18,199 --> 00:46:20,040
How long was I out for?

696
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:21,960
Some of it's his.

697
00:46:22,119 --> 00:46:23,200
Et tu, Marvin?

698
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:25,399
Style is the only constant in life.

699
00:46:27,999 --> 00:46:31,000
We didn't come to Paris on vacation.

700
00:46:33,079 --> 00:46:37,040
Shopping's what I
thought you did in Paris...

701
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:39,000
with your boyfriend's money...

702
00:46:39,079 --> 00:46:41,000
while you're waiting for him...

703
00:46:41,079 --> 00:46:42,160
to wake up from being taken down...

704
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:47,040
by his skanky, slutty,
Russian bi-atch ex girlfriend.

705
00:46:47,079 --> 00:46:48,080
So thanks.

706
00:46:48,999 --> 00:46:51,120
Thanks for the compliment for the fur.

707
00:46:51,159 --> 00:46:54,000
For telling me that I
look nice in my dress.

708
00:46:54,039 --> 00:46:55,040
It makes me feel really good.

709
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:57,120
And it makes me feel very
loving towards you also.

710
00:47:01,039 --> 00:47:02,120
Why is she doing this to me?

711
00:47:02,159 --> 00:47:04,040
We can get a taxi over here.

712
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:07,080
Listen, I gotta tell you something.

713
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:12,040
You have to share your feelings
to evolve your relationship.

714
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:14,160
Even if it seems uncomfortable at first.

715
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:17,160
Say you're pinned down in a firefight.

716
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:21,040
If you stay where you are,
you're gonna die. Okay?

717
00:47:21,079 --> 00:47:23,960
So what do you do?

718
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:25,078
Make the run.

719
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:25,080
Yes. You have got to make the run...
Make the run.

720
00:47:25,081 --> 00:47:28,120
Yes. You have got to make the run...

721
00:47:28,199 --> 00:47:30,160
to emotional safety.

722
00:47:50,199 --> 00:47:52,158
You dead yet, Moses?

723
00:47:52,159 --> 00:47:52,160
Not yet.
You dead yet, Moses?

724
00:47:52,161 --> 00:47:53,120
Not yet.

725
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:03,960
Where's my plane?!

726
00:48:04,039 --> 00:48:05,040
In my ass!

727
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:10,160
It's in an airport outside of Paris.

728
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,120
What are you? Shut up!

729
00:48:14,039 --> 00:48:15,000
Let's get outta here.

730
00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:35,539
Marvin?

731
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:36,460
Yeah?

732
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:41,120
Is that a stick of
dynamite in your pocket?

733
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:44,120
Yeah, but I'm saving it for an emergency.

734
00:48:45,159 --> 00:48:48,200
This is kind of an emergency, isn't it?

735
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:13,160
CREDIT LYONNAIS BANK

736
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:15,080
PARIS

737
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,160
The key I gave her is connected to...

738
00:49:17,199 --> 00:49:22,000
a particularly nasty terrorist
cell and their safe deposit box.

739
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:25,080
The French take this kinda
thing pretty seriously.

740
00:49:25,999 --> 00:49:27,000
That's enough.

741
00:49:27,079 --> 00:49:29,120
Put me down now! Now!

742
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:34,080
Alright.

743
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:39,200
We gotta move quickly, Moscow
will have her out within the hour.

744
00:49:42,039 --> 00:49:44,000
For the love of Mike.

745
00:49:47,159 --> 00:49:48,120
Alright.

746
00:49:49,159 --> 00:49:51,040
I'm still not talking to you.

747
00:50:01,159 --> 00:50:04,120
This is an MI6 report
on Project Nightshade.

748
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:07,080
It's about the operative
that placed the device.

749
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:09,960
They took him into
custody and put him on ICE.

750
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:11,040
What's ICE?

751
00:50:11,079 --> 00:50:13,040
Incarcerate, Cannot Execute.

752
00:50:13,159 --> 00:50:16,200
Who would they keep on ICE for 32 years?

753
00:50:18,999 --> 00:50:20,120
Come on. Gotta go.

754
00:50:23,159 --> 00:50:26,080
ENGLAND

755
00:50:45,159 --> 00:50:48,000
How could she have possibly found us?

756
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:03,120
Cause I called her and
told her we were coming.

757
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:10,040
I couldn't take the
pressure of not knowing.

758
00:51:18,119 --> 00:51:20,120
Why isn't she shooting at us?

759
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:44,000
That should buy us 24 hours.

760
00:51:44,999 --> 00:51:46,160
Hello, sweetie.

761
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:51,040
The next time you 2 make a plan
like this, at least let me in on it.

762
00:51:52,199 --> 00:51:54,078
You're compromising me.

763
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:54,080
Who knows what some girl is gonna squeeze out of you?
You're compromising me.

764
00:51:54,081 --> 00:51:57,960
Who knows what some girl
is gonna squeeze out of you?

765
00:51:59,079 --> 00:52:01,000
Where'd you get the bodies?

766
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:02,960
My freezer.

767
00:52:10,199 --> 00:52:12,040
Come on. Wake up.

768
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:14,080
Yeah?

769
00:52:14,119 --> 00:52:15,120
What the hell's going on?

770
00:52:15,159 --> 00:52:16,040
Sir?

771
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:17,120
Get anything from The Frog?

772
00:52:17,159 --> 00:52:21,000
No, he took some sorta poison
before we really talked.

773
00:52:21,999 --> 00:52:23,080
I don't think he's gonna say anything now.

774
00:52:23,159 --> 00:52:25,040
You've got to find Moses and Boggs.

775
00:52:27,079 --> 00:52:29,120
Don't worry. I'm on the trail.

776
00:52:29,199 --> 00:52:32,960
LONDON

777
00:52:34,199 --> 00:52:37,120
On your right, you see
the famous Tower of London.

778
00:52:37,999 --> 00:52:40,160
And shortly, we'll be passing
under the Tower Bridge.

779
00:52:45,999 --> 00:52:47,120
It's a fortress.

780
00:52:47,199 --> 00:52:50,040
It's an asylum for the criminally insane.

781
00:52:50,159 --> 00:52:51,960
He's in the ICE unit.

782
00:52:52,039 --> 00:52:54,160
That's an MI6 Alpha
Level secure facility...

783
00:52:54,999 --> 00:52:56,320
buried deep within that building.

784
00:52:57,039 --> 00:52:59,080
It's like a prison within a prison.

785
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:03,160
How are we gonna get in there?

786
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:09,120
She wants my head!

787
00:53:09,199 --> 00:53:10,960
It's a Papist plot.

788
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:14,960
It's that bitch May Queen
of Scots. She wants my head.

789
00:53:15,039 --> 00:53:16,120
What are you doing? No!

790
00:53:16,199 --> 00:53:18,160
Get me Cecil. I'm the Queen of England!

791
00:53:19,079 --> 00:53:20,960
Don't take me to the Tower!

792
00:53:21,079 --> 00:53:23,200
I'll have your head for this, you bitch!

793
00:53:23,999 --> 00:53:26,160
No! No!

794
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:32,120
"Uneasy lies the head
that wears the crown."

795
00:53:33,079 --> 00:53:36,040
They're plotting against me. All of them.

796
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:38,040
There's a good queen.

797
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:42,160
Stuff it, you old bat.

798
00:53:42,999 --> 00:53:44,200
Thank you.

799
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:48,080
Not so much the "old", if you don't mind.

800
00:53:56,999 --> 00:53:58,120
I think it was really good.

801
00:53:58,159 --> 00:54:00,160
I thought I was channeling Bette Davis.

802
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:05,160
Good morning. Dr. Jones to
see prisoner number 1 7, please.

803
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:07,120
Dr. Jones? Are you with MI6?

804
00:54:07,199 --> 00:54:09,000
Certainly, not anymore.

805
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:11,160
I don't seem to have you on my list.

806
00:54:13,079 --> 00:54:16,120
Bloody thing's not working. Why's that?

807
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:19,160
You're supposed to use

808
00:54:19,999 --> 00:54:21,160
Lay down on the ground.

809
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,960
Attaboy. On the floor.

810
00:54:25,079 --> 00:54:28,160
Number 121. There it is.

811
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:38,120
Frank!

812
00:54:54,039 --> 00:54:56,040
Who are you? You're visitors?
Who are you looking for?

813
00:54:56,119 --> 00:54:58,120
We love having visitors, don't we, fellas?

814
00:54:59,039 --> 00:55:01,080
Dr. Bailey?

815
00:55:02,039 --> 00:55:03,160
Doctor Bailey?

816
00:55:03,999 --> 00:55:06,040
Yes. Who did you expect to find here?

817
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:13,040
Sir...

818
00:55:13,079 --> 00:55:14,120
What?

819
00:55:14,199 --> 00:55:16,120
I saw you die.

820
00:55:16,159 --> 00:55:18,000
Saw me die? Who is he?

821
00:55:18,039 --> 00:55:19,120
Frank?

822
00:55:19,199 --> 00:55:23,120
Frank Moses, my dear fellow!
How are you, old sport?

823
00:55:23,199 --> 00:55:25,080
So glad to see you. So glad you came by.

824
00:55:25,199 --> 00:55:27,000
We've been expecting
you. Haven't we, fellas?

825
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:28,120
My God, why are you so old?

826
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:29,160
Good lord!

827
00:55:30,039 --> 00:55:30,160
Sir...

828
00:55:30,199 --> 00:55:31,960
What?

829
00:55:32,119 --> 00:55:35,120
You've been locked up here for 32 years.

830
00:55:35,159 --> 00:55:38,120
Frankie, you've gotta be
kidding me. Come on, put 'em up.

831
00:55:38,199 --> 00:55:41,080
32 years. How extraordinay. Who are you?

832
00:55:41,159 --> 00:55:42,120
Victoria.

833
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:45,960
Victoria! You should read this.
Lenin. " State and Revolution."

834
00:55:46,039 --> 00:55:48,040
Jolly good time. Stalin
got it wrong, of course.

835
00:55:48,159 --> 00:55:51,000
Where are we going, Frank?
Are you taking us to the opera?

836
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:53,120
Is that where we're going? We
love the opera, don't we, fellas?

837
00:55:53,199 --> 00:55:55,559
The opera and the champagne
and the strawberries all 'round.

838
00:55:56,039 --> 00:55:57,160
Sorry, my dear, what is your name again?

839
00:55:57,199 --> 00:55:58,080
Victoria.

840
00:55:58,159 --> 00:56:01,960
Sorry, it's the drugs they're
feeding me, it's my short term memory.

841
00:56:02,039 --> 00:56:06,160
Something that's meant to
keep us peaceful or harmless!

842
00:56:06,999 --> 00:56:10,160
Anyway, it's around here
somewhere, but I don't know where.

843
00:56:11,199 --> 00:56:14,160
Dr. Bailey, we need your help.

844
00:56:14,199 --> 00:56:16,200
Do you remember Nightshade?

845
00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:21,000
I'm looking for my pipe and
my St. Christopher medallion.

846
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:23,200
Boys gave it to someone.
They were little boys.

847
00:56:23,999 --> 00:56:26,160
And now it's gone somehow.

848
00:56:37,039 --> 00:56:39,080
Oh shit!

849
00:56:40,159 --> 00:56:41,960
Hey, Frankie, I'm over here.

850
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:43,920
I found it. It was in
my pocket the whole time.

851
00:56:43,999 --> 00:56:46,040
I couldn't find my damn
pipe, though. But here it is.

852
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:48,160
Sorry, my dear, what was
the question you asked me?

853
00:56:48,999 --> 00:56:50,160
Do you remember Nightshade?

854
00:56:50,999 --> 00:56:53,000
Vaguely. It was some
kind of a bomb, I believe.

855
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:57,000
People are looking for that
weapon. People who want to use it.

856
00:56:57,039 --> 00:56:59,080
Oh dear. Yes, I do
understand of course. Believe me

857
00:56:59,159 --> 00:57:02,120
But I made many things
for the Americans and...

858
00:57:02,199 --> 00:57:04,200
Nightshade turned out to
be a bit of a nightmare.

859
00:57:04,999 --> 00:57:06,120
It was quite different.
Turned out to be too dangerous.

860
00:57:06,199 --> 00:57:08,960
So naturally, they had to
lock me up in this place.

861
00:57:09,039 --> 00:57:11,000
And after what they did to me,
I think it's perfectly natural...

862
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:14,160
I tell them all to go F off!

863
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:18,000
MI6 tried to fake Bailey's death?

864
00:57:18,119 --> 00:57:19,160
Why? What are they hiding?

865
00:57:19,999 --> 00:57:22,280
You're gonna have to go. You're
gonna have to go find out.

866
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:26,080
You know they're gonna ty and kill me.

867
00:57:26,199 --> 00:57:27,120
I'll call you from Russia.

868
00:57:27,199 --> 00:57:30,000
Maintenance to Bridge 7.

869
00:57:31,039 --> 00:57:33,080
We got a breach in Maximum Security.

870
00:57:41,999 --> 00:57:43,080
Secure!

871
00:57:48,159 --> 00:57:49,960
What's so important?

872
00:57:50,039 --> 00:57:53,120
I just heard from my source at MI6 that
Edward Bailey's alive and on the run.

873
00:57:53,199 --> 00:57:54,120
That's not possible.

874
00:57:54,999 --> 00:57:57,040
This is bigger than a rogue general
and his unexploded ordinance.

875
00:57:57,119 --> 00:57:58,040
What don't I know?

876
00:57:58,159 --> 00:57:59,960
The game has changed.

877
00:58:00,039 --> 00:58:02,000
The things Bailey knows are too dangerous.

878
00:58:02,159 --> 00:58:06,200
If Bailey or Nightshade fall into
terrorist hands, millions will die.

879
00:58:07,159 --> 00:58:09,000
Holy shit, it's real.

880
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:12,040
Unless we secure it, that weapon's
going off in the middle of Moscow.

881
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:15,080
Right now, that's our best case scenario.

882
00:58:22,039 --> 00:58:24,040
RUSSIA

883
00:58:46,119 --> 00:58:48,960
Guys?

884
00:59:06,199 --> 00:59:09,080
Welcome, my friends.

885
00:59:11,159 --> 00:59:16,040
So, it is true. You're alive.

886
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:20,160
Tell me, then, where is this device?

887
00:59:21,079 --> 00:59:23,000
Who?

888
00:59:26,039 --> 00:59:28,000
Work in progress.

889
00:59:29,999 --> 00:59:32,040
I never thought I'd be smuggling...

890
00:59:32,159 --> 00:59:35,960
Frank Moses into the
heart of Mother Russia.

891
00:59:36,159 --> 00:59:38,040
Me, neither.

892
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:41,080
Before I forget. A little something.

893
00:59:41,159 --> 00:59:45,040
If you are caught or Han catches you...

894
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:50,120
suicide pill is a much better
option than what you face.

895
00:59:51,999 --> 00:59:55,160
You die with Russian smile on.

896
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:00,080
Good luck.

897
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:02,080
Mr. Bailey.

898
01:00:02,159 --> 01:00:03,080
Yes, Frank?

899
01:00:03,159 --> 01:00:08,000
Is there any way you could tell us
where you hid the nuclear weapon?

900
01:00:08,119 --> 01:00:12,080
Look at all those cows. They're beautiful.

901
01:00:12,999 --> 01:00:14,960
Yeah.

902
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:18,080
Cows?

903
01:00:23,079 --> 01:00:26,000
Hi! Yoo hoo!

904
01:00:29,039 --> 01:00:31,120
That's not good.

905
01:00:31,999 --> 01:00:34,080
MOSCOW

906
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:47,000
We have eyes on, Frank.

907
01:01:06,119 --> 01:01:08,040
Where's my plane?

908
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:12,040
They paid me to kill you.

909
01:01:12,119 --> 01:01:14,160
They didn't say I had
to do it all at once.

910
01:01:14,999 --> 01:01:15,960
FREEZE

911
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:17,040
HANDS ON YOUR HEAD

912
01:01:30,039 --> 01:01:32,080
THIS IS OFFICER BOESKY. OFFICER DOWN

913
01:01:32,159 --> 01:01:35,040
WE NEED MEDICAL ASSISTANCE

914
01:01:42,119 --> 01:01:45,080
FREEZE, HANDS ON YOUR HEAD

915
01:01:45,199 --> 01:01:47,040
What's wrong with him?

916
01:02:44,039 --> 01:02:45,160
Wow.

917
01:02:45,999 --> 01:02:47,080
What is this place?

918
01:02:47,199 --> 01:02:49,080
My first safe house.

919
01:02:50,199 --> 01:02:54,160
Untouched, since 1984.

920
01:03:01,159 --> 01:03:03,040
Fugu poison?

921
01:03:03,159 --> 01:03:06,960
Fugu poison is deadly
stuff. Terrible death.

922
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:10,200
This little gizmo? XKG gas. I invented it.

923
01:03:11,159 --> 01:03:14,000
We tried to take out old
Fidel Castro in '61 in Cuba.

924
01:03:14,119 --> 01:03:16,040
That didn't work though.

925
01:03:16,119 --> 01:03:17,120
Any tea, Frank?

926
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,200
Why does Han hate you so much?

927
01:03:19,999 --> 01:03:21,160
Not enough hugs as a child.

928
01:03:23,159 --> 01:03:28,080
Frank framed him for
stealing state secrets.

929
01:03:28,199 --> 01:03:32,160
So he went from being a highly
decorated counter intel officer...

930
01:03:32,999 --> 01:03:35,160
to being a pariah.

931
01:03:36,039 --> 01:03:37,960
What's ironic is that Frank...

932
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:42,080
actually created the
circumstances for his own death.

933
01:03:42,159 --> 01:03:43,960
It's poetic.

934
01:03:44,119 --> 01:03:45,160
I ain't dead yet.

935
01:03:53,999 --> 01:03:57,080
Should you eat that?

936
01:03:57,199 --> 01:03:59,160
Is that safe?

937
01:03:59,199 --> 01:04:03,960
It's before they had that,
you know, "sell by" date stuff.

938
01:04:06,999 --> 01:04:09,000
Did you get to meet Castro?

939
01:04:09,159 --> 01:04:10,160
Who?

940
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:12,120
Did you get to meet Castro?

941
01:04:12,159 --> 01:04:14,400
Yes, I did. About 2 weeks
after Kennedy was assassinated.

942
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:16,079
Talking of which, Frank...

943
01:04:16,119 --> 01:04:19,120
I'm starting to remember
more and more who I am...

944
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,000
and who I was and the weapons I made.

945
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:23,080
My God, it really is amazing.

946
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:26,960
How efficiently those boys
from MI6, God bless 'em...

947
01:04:27,079 --> 01:04:29,280
But they really do throw us
away. Don't they, old sport?

948
01:04:29,999 --> 01:04:32,040
When we're no longer
convenient, I suppose.

949
01:04:32,159 --> 01:04:34,519
As though we'd never given them
the best years of our lives.

950
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:36,080
Bit of a joke, really.

951
01:04:37,079 --> 01:04:39,040
Yes, very strange.

952
01:04:40,159 --> 01:04:43,160
Do you remember where Nightshade is?

953
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:45,080
I'm sorry, my dear?

954
01:04:45,199 --> 01:04:48,040
Do you remember where Nightshade is?

955
01:04:48,119 --> 01:04:49,160
Oh, yes.

956
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:52,960
This feels right.

957
01:04:55,999 --> 01:04:58,200
It's around here somewhere.
I'm sure this time.

958
01:04:59,079 --> 01:05:01,120
Everything looks different completely.

959
01:05:01,159 --> 01:05:03,040
Maybe it's over here.

960
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:04,000
It's been hours.

961
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:05,040
Yeah, this is it.

962
01:05:05,159 --> 01:05:06,960
Here we are.

963
01:05:07,159 --> 01:05:10,040
How are those Jimmy
Choos working out for you?

964
01:05:10,999 --> 01:05:12,039
The entrance is up there.

965
01:05:12,119 --> 01:05:13,080
PAPA JOHN'S

966
01:05:13,199 --> 01:05:14,960
Who's Papa John?

967
01:05:15,079 --> 01:05:16,040
It's new.

968
01:05:16,159 --> 01:05:17,160
Entrance to what?

969
01:05:17,999 --> 01:05:19,639
Secret tunnels through the old catacombs.

970
01:05:20,039 --> 01:05:21,960
Brezhnev used it to sneak his mistress in.

971
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:22,579
In where?

972
01:05:22,999 --> 01:05:23,960
In there.

973
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:26,960
The Kremlin?

974
01:05:27,079 --> 01:05:28,960
The weapon is in the Kremlin?

975
01:05:29,079 --> 01:05:31,080
It's the one place they wouldn't look.

976
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:51,080
Jesus.Do you mind keeping it warm?

977
01:06:05,079 --> 01:06:08,040
You have no idea the damage you've done.

978
01:06:08,159 --> 01:06:11,080
You kept one of our own
locked up for 32 years.

979
01:06:11,159 --> 01:06:12,280
I have kept the world safe.

980
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:14,040
If that weapon falls into the wrong hands

981
01:06:14,119 --> 01:06:16,000
The weapon?

982
01:06:17,079 --> 01:06:20,160
You haven't the slightest idea.

983
01:06:26,119 --> 01:06:30,000
You must let me call Moses. He
doesn't know what he's walking into.

984
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:34,040
You've had your chance. It's over.

985
01:06:34,159 --> 01:06:36,200
I'm sorry, Victoria.

986
01:06:42,199 --> 01:06:45,040
Sorry, my ass.

987
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:48,040
They say you're a legend around here.

988
01:06:48,159 --> 01:06:49,120
I've...

989
01:06:50,199 --> 01:06:52,160
I've never heard of you.

990
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:56,040
Must have been a bit before my time.

991
01:07:01,199 --> 01:07:03,960
You've heard of me now.

992
01:07:06,159 --> 01:07:10,120
How is it possible they never picked up
the radiation signature from that bomb?

993
01:07:10,199 --> 01:07:12,160
That's the million dollar question.

994
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:17,000
Hey, gang. This is new.

995
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:19,120
What do you think is behind that wall?

996
01:07:21,199 --> 01:07:23,200
I think Russians.

997
01:07:46,159 --> 01:07:48,960
If anybody sees that hole, we're dead.

998
01:07:49,079 --> 01:07:50,960
I'm gonna need you to help
me to disarm the weapon.

999
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:52,960
Somebody's gotta guard the door.

1000
01:07:54,039 --> 01:07:54,539
No.

1001
01:07:54,999 --> 01:07:55,960
But...

1002
01:07:57,199 --> 01:07:58,120
You'll need this.

1003
01:08:04,159 --> 01:08:05,200
COMRADE GENERAL

1004
01:08:05,999 --> 01:08:08,200
THIS IS RED SQUARE 20 MINUTES AGO

1005
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:11,200
SECURITY SWEEP THE
BUILDING, GET THE ARMY NOW

1006
01:08:11,999 --> 01:08:12,599
One more time.

1007
01:08:18,079 --> 01:08:19,960
Great. What does that mean?

1008
01:08:20,079 --> 01:08:22,040
"Gas leak. Maintenance is coming."

1009
01:08:22,119 --> 01:08:23,120
Good. And then they'll move on.

1010
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:24,160
What if they don't?

1011
01:08:24,999 --> 01:08:25,120
Want a gun?

1012
01:08:25,159 --> 01:08:26,000
Yes.

1013
01:08:26,079 --> 01:08:27,120
No gun.

1014
01:08:27,199 --> 01:08:29,000
Just don't move.

1015
01:08:29,119 --> 01:08:30,160
You're a security guard.

1016
01:08:31,159 --> 01:08:33,120
Don't smile. You can't smile.

1017
01:08:36,159 --> 01:08:39,000
You never leave your post. Okay?

1018
01:08:40,119 --> 01:08:42,000
Nice.

1019
01:08:54,119 --> 01:08:56,040
2 shots, here and here.

1020
01:08:56,119 --> 01:08:58,120
Drag the body in there
and repeat as necessary.

1021
01:08:58,199 --> 01:08:59,120
No safety.

1022
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:01,080
No safety.

1023
01:09:15,079 --> 01:09:18,080
Frank, I don't like the Kremlin so much.

1024
01:09:18,999 --> 01:09:23,040
And I like being underneath it even less.

1025
01:09:35,999 --> 01:09:37,040
Here we are.

1026
01:09:39,039 --> 01:09:42,120
That's great. It's just like yesterday.

1027
01:09:43,159 --> 01:09:46,080
There's my crow bar. Look at this.

1028
01:09:47,199 --> 01:09:49,080
There.

1029
01:09:49,159 --> 01:09:50,960
Hey, look, chaps.

1030
01:09:51,079 --> 01:09:53,000
That's my old pipe. I knew
I'd left it somewhere.

1031
01:09:53,119 --> 01:09:56,040
My dear wife bought this for me in
1969. It was our wedding anniversary.

1032
01:09:56,159 --> 01:09:57,040
Oh yes!

1033
01:09:57,159 --> 01:10:02,000
This is Nightshade, by the way.

1034
01:10:07,039 --> 01:10:08,200
There.

1035
01:10:09,199 --> 01:10:10,160
Is that...?

1036
01:10:10,999 --> 01:10:12,080
That's Red Mercury.

1037
01:10:12,199 --> 01:10:14,080
Red Mercury?

1038
01:10:14,199 --> 01:10:17,040
We were always told
it was a Cold War myth.

1039
01:10:17,119 --> 01:10:19,039
Yes, they said it couldn't
be done, but I did it.

1040
01:10:19,079 --> 01:10:20,200
If that's Red Mercury...

1041
01:10:21,039 --> 01:10:23,720
you can zip it up in a backpack
and take it on the White House tour.

1042
01:10:24,039 --> 01:10:25,080
It's undetectable.

1043
01:10:25,199 --> 01:10:28,040
No signature. No fallout.

1044
01:10:28,119 --> 01:10:31,960
This weapon will entirely change
the balance of international power...

1045
01:10:32,039 --> 01:10:33,079
overnight. Just like that.

1046
01:10:34,159 --> 01:10:36,120
We're all gonna die.

1047
01:10:36,199 --> 01:10:38,040
On your knees.

1048
01:10:40,999 --> 01:10:42,120
Katia.

1049
01:10:43,039 --> 01:10:45,080
No government should have this weapon.

1050
01:10:45,999 --> 01:10:48,120
Not yours. And not mine.

1051
01:10:48,999 --> 01:10:50,160
I have orders.

1052
01:10:51,199 --> 01:10:54,040
This isn't about orders.
This is about right and wrong.

1053
01:10:54,199 --> 01:10:56,040
Don't.

1054
01:10:58,039 --> 01:11:00,080
Did you really come to
see me in the States?

1055
01:11:00,199 --> 01:11:02,000
Yes.

1056
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:05,960
What color were the
flowers outside my house?

1057
01:11:12,199 --> 01:11:14,160
Yellow.

1058
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:28,160
I notice you are still
holding up the wall.

1059
01:11:31,079 --> 01:11:34,960
Gas Leak, maintenance is coming

1060
01:11:37,039 --> 01:11:39,000
I am Pasha.

1061
01:11:40,119 --> 01:11:45,000
You want to get a drink later?

1062
01:11:47,159 --> 01:11:49,040
Yes?

1063
01:11:52,159 --> 01:11:56,200
I thought perhaps you noticed me too!

1064
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:12,040
What in the name of? Hey!

1065
01:12:14,039 --> 01:12:15,960
What are you doing kissing this guy?

1066
01:12:16,079 --> 01:12:17,079
I didn't wanna kill him.

1067
01:12:17,119 --> 01:12:18,960
What kinda stupid logic is that?

1068
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:21,040
What in the Sam Hill is she doing here?

1069
01:12:21,119 --> 01:12:22,279
She's working with us again.

1070
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:24,080
Like heck she is.

1071
01:12:24,199 --> 01:12:25,080
Why were you kissing that guy?

1072
01:12:25,159 --> 01:12:29,120
Kids, what happens in the
Kremlin stays in the Kremlin.

1073
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:34,960
You are gonna have to explain this to me.

1074
01:12:56,159 --> 01:12:57,960
Hey, Comrades!

1075
01:12:58,119 --> 01:12:59,160
Here's to more success.

1076
01:12:59,999 --> 01:13:00,499
Success.

1077
01:13:01,039 --> 01:13:01,960
And saving the world!

1078
01:13:02,039 --> 01:13:07,960
Saving the world!

1079
01:13:12,999 --> 01:13:15,080
I got this. Right back.

1080
01:13:15,159 --> 01:13:16,160
Hey.

1081
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:17,560
Where are you?

1082
01:13:17,999 --> 01:13:18,960
Moscow.

1083
01:13:19,079 --> 01:13:20,160
He's a nutter, Francis.

1084
01:13:21,039 --> 01:13:23,120
MI6 didn't lock him up
because he created the weapon...

1085
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:25,040
but because he wants to see it go off.

1086
01:13:30,119 --> 01:13:32,080
Hello, Frank.

1087
01:13:32,199 --> 01:13:34,960
That was Victoria, wasn't it?

1088
01:13:35,079 --> 01:13:37,160
Telling you that I was
some sort of a monster...

1089
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:41,120
who once wanted to
destroy the Soviet empire.

1090
01:13:41,999 --> 01:13:45,080
Yeah. Very slowly.

1091
01:13:46,199 --> 01:13:49,080
That's it. Good boy.

1092
01:13:54,039 --> 01:13:57,120
Good. In you go.

1093
01:13:57,199 --> 01:13:59,120
Marvin...

1094
01:13:59,199 --> 01:14:02,080
Guns down.

1095
01:14:08,159 --> 01:14:12,000
Weapons down. Very slowly.

1096
01:14:12,999 --> 01:14:15,040
You planted the thing on WikiLeaks.

1097
01:14:15,159 --> 01:14:18,200
Yes, it was a cell
phone taken from a guard.

1098
01:14:19,039 --> 01:14:21,120
I was just itching to
get my revenge on MI6.

1099
01:14:22,039 --> 01:14:25,000
Frank, you were absolutely
marvelous the way you found The Frog.

1100
01:14:25,119 --> 01:14:26,440
No one else could have found him.

1101
01:14:26,999 --> 01:14:28,040
Jack?

1102
01:14:29,159 --> 01:14:33,000
Sorry, Frank, I made a deal already
with Mr. Gordon for Red Mercury.

1103
01:14:33,119 --> 01:14:34,080
Well done, Bailey.

1104
01:14:34,159 --> 01:14:35,160
Thanks.

1105
01:14:35,999 --> 01:14:37,000
Nice to see you again.

1106
01:14:37,079 --> 01:14:38,120
Pick up the guns.

1107
01:14:39,079 --> 01:14:42,160
Your county appreciates your sacrifice.

1108
01:14:43,119 --> 01:14:45,160
But your time's up.

1109
01:14:45,999 --> 01:14:47,200
Let's go.

1110
01:14:48,999 --> 01:14:50,040
It's time, Bailey.

1111
01:14:50,119 --> 01:14:52,040
Yes, it is time.

1112
01:14:54,039 --> 01:14:57,960
Very Interesting. Rogue American
agents turned nuclear terrorists...

1113
01:14:58,199 --> 01:15:01,040
kill top Russian officer.

1114
01:15:01,119 --> 01:15:03,000
Not good.

1115
01:15:03,079 --> 01:15:06,080
So long, Frank. So long, Marvin.

1116
01:15:06,159 --> 01:15:08,960
Come on, boys, let's go.

1117
01:15:13,079 --> 01:15:15,080
Easy.

1118
01:15:47,079 --> 01:15:49,120
Please, let me take that from you.

1119
01:15:50,039 --> 01:15:52,120
I thought we were doing
the debriefing in London.

1120
01:15:52,159 --> 01:15:53,080
We were.

1121
01:15:53,119 --> 01:15:56,120
But since you're such a sick, twisted
bastard, you're going to Colorado.

1122
01:15:56,199 --> 01:15:59,160
There's a secret facility
there, about a mile underground...

1123
01:15:59,199 --> 01:16:01,000
where you will spend
your remaining years...

1124
01:16:01,079 --> 01:16:04,120
having evey bit of knowledge
plucked from that giant head of yours.

1125
01:16:04,159 --> 01:16:05,160
Really?

1126
01:16:06,039 --> 01:16:09,160
Frankly, it will make your last 32 years...

1127
01:16:09,199 --> 01:16:11,160
seem like a vacation in the Caribbean.

1128
01:16:13,039 --> 01:16:14,000
Cuff him.

1129
01:16:16,159 --> 01:16:17,160
I say.

1130
01:16:18,199 --> 01:16:19,160
Well, well.

1131
01:16:23,039 --> 01:16:24,998
Bet you didn't see that
coming. Did you, old man?

1132
01:16:24,999 --> 01:16:25,000
I must say, I didn't. Jolly good. Bet you
didn't see that coming. Did you, old man?

1133
01:16:25,001 --> 01:16:27,160
I must say, I didn't. Jolly good.

1134
01:16:27,199 --> 01:16:28,080
After you.

1135
01:16:29,039 --> 01:16:30,400
Thank you.Good morning, gentlemen.

1136
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:52,641
What did he say?

1137
01:16:52,999 --> 01:16:53,499
Ready.

1138
01:16:54,199 --> 01:16:56,040
Do something. Do something.

1139
01:16:56,119 --> 01:16:57,040
I love you.

1140
01:16:57,119 --> 01:16:59,120
At least Han didn't get us first.

1141
01:16:59,159 --> 01:17:01,200
Really? You're gonna
bring that up right now?

1142
01:17:17,079 --> 01:17:20,960
There is nothing more
sexy in the whole world...

1143
01:17:21,159 --> 01:17:23,160
than a beautiful woman...

1144
01:17:23,199 --> 01:17:25,200
with an incredible gun.

1145
01:17:26,999 --> 01:17:28,120
You're such a romantic.

1146
01:17:35,079 --> 01:17:35,960
Watch your eyes.

1147
01:17:38,079 --> 01:17:39,000
Close your eyes.

1148
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:45,080
I love the way your toes
curl right before you fire.

1149
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:46,960
Hopeless.

1150
01:18:30,079 --> 01:18:31,200
Freeze.

1151
01:18:34,159 --> 01:18:38,040
I don't think you ought to
point that idiotic thing at me.

1152
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:41,000
You should really start thinking
about your security protocol.

1153
01:18:42,999 --> 01:18:44,000
What the hell is that?

1154
01:18:44,039 --> 01:18:46,000
That my dear boy, is an antidote...

1155
01:18:46,039 --> 01:18:50,000
to the most powerful nerve
agent ever created. Look.

1156
01:18:59,119 --> 01:19:00,120
Hello, boys.

1157
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:18,000
Hello, Mr. Davis.

1158
01:19:23,039 --> 01:19:26,040
And you didn't see that
coming. Did you, old sport?

1159
01:19:26,159 --> 01:19:29,040
I'm sure you wouldn't want
to miss what's coming next.

1160
01:19:29,199 --> 01:19:32,040
It's a little antidote. Jolly good.

1161
01:19:32,999 --> 01:19:33,560
That's right.

1162
01:19:35,119 --> 01:19:37,160
Good. Thank you.

1163
01:19:39,079 --> 01:19:40,040
Jolly good.

1164
01:19:41,079 --> 01:19:45,040
Honestly, Frank, 2 days and
you're in front of a firing squad?

1165
01:19:45,079 --> 01:19:46,000
Yeah. But look...

1166
01:19:46,039 --> 01:19:48,960
No excuses. You're better
than this. It's pathetic.

1167
01:19:49,039 --> 01:19:52,200
An American military transport
made an emergency landing in London.

1168
01:19:52,999 --> 01:19:55,120
Everyone aboard was found dead.

1169
01:19:55,199 --> 01:19:59,118
Bailey has taken refuge
in the Iranian embassy.

1170
01:19:59,119 --> 01:19:59,120
The Iranian embassy? Bailey has taken
refuge in the Iranian embassy.

1171
01:19:59,121 --> 01:20:01,000
The Iranian embassy?

1172
01:20:01,079 --> 01:20:02,120
We've gotta go there.

1173
01:20:03,079 --> 01:20:05,040
Alright. Get 'em ready.

1174
01:20:05,199 --> 01:20:07,200
I'm gonna make sure
we're cleared for takeoff.

1175
01:20:08,159 --> 01:20:10,080
If the world is here in a week...

1176
01:20:11,199 --> 01:20:13,960
I will meet you in the Turks and Caicos.

1177
01:20:14,199 --> 01:20:17,000
And we will spend all night...

1178
01:20:17,119 --> 01:20:20,080
beneath the stars.

1179
01:20:58,039 --> 01:20:59,040
I don't speak Korean!

1180
01:21:08,159 --> 01:21:09,160
You having fun yet?

1181
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:12,000
I'll let you know when I start having fun.

1182
01:21:15,119 --> 01:21:16,200
You betrayed me.

1183
01:21:17,079 --> 01:21:18,000
I had no choice.

1184
01:21:24,159 --> 01:21:27,040
You'd have done the same
thing, if you were me.

1185
01:21:32,119 --> 01:21:33,960
How much is the US paying you?

1186
01:21:34,079 --> 01:21:35,040
20 million.

1187
01:21:35,119 --> 01:21:36,080
Are you kiddin' me?

1188
01:21:38,199 --> 01:21:39,160
I asked for more.

1189
01:21:43,079 --> 01:21:44,040
What happened to you?

1190
01:21:44,119 --> 01:21:45,279
You used to be a good agent.

1191
01:21:57,960 --> 01:21:58,761
Stop! Wait a minute.

1192
01:21:58,999 --> 01:22:00,080
Listen, I need your help.

1193
01:22:01,039 --> 01:22:03,960
I know there's a part of you
that wants to do the right thing.

1194
01:22:03,999 --> 01:22:05,840
There is a weapon that's
gonna be detonated...

1195
01:22:08,199 --> 01:22:09,160
Bullshit.

1196
01:22:11,999 --> 01:22:13,040
It's not bullshit.

1197
01:22:16,039 --> 01:22:18,040
There's a bomb headed
for London right now.

1198
01:22:18,199 --> 01:22:21,200
11 million people are gonna lose
their lives if you don't help me.

1199
01:22:56,119 --> 01:22:57,120
Alright.

1200
01:22:59,199 --> 01:23:00,200
Let's go.

1201
01:23:06,119 --> 01:23:09,040
This doesn't mean I'm not
going to kill you later.

1202
01:23:10,079 --> 01:23:11,040
I know.

1203
01:23:12,079 --> 01:23:14,080
I think the way to make
a relationship work...

1204
01:23:14,119 --> 01:23:16,120
is that neither of you
give up who you are.

1205
01:23:16,159 --> 01:23:17,160
Don't you agree, Marvin?

1206
01:23:27,999 --> 01:23:30,120
Exactly. Exactly what Marvin says.

1207
01:23:30,199 --> 01:23:33,200
Falling in love is like
jumping off a cliff.

1208
01:23:33,999 --> 01:23:35,439
You just have to believe and let go.

1209
01:23:38,999 --> 01:23:40,040
My God!

1210
01:23:42,039 --> 01:23:43,080
Are you okay?

1211
01:23:45,159 --> 01:23:46,160
No, he's alright.

1212
01:23:46,199 --> 01:23:48,200
He's with us.

1213
01:23:51,159 --> 01:23:52,160
We talked it out.

1214
01:24:07,199 --> 01:24:11,960
Kill Bailey. Secure the
weapon. How hard can it be?

1215
01:24:14,079 --> 01:24:16,960
The external security is very very heavy but...

1216
01:24:16,999 --> 01:24:19,160
inside there are hardcore
Revolutionary Guards.

1217
01:24:19,199 --> 01:24:21,160
They are serious fanatics.

1218
01:24:23,199 --> 01:24:25,160
The whole thing depends on her.

1219
01:24:26,199 --> 01:24:30,000
You do realize, if they
catch you, they will kill you.

1220
01:24:36,079 --> 01:24:37,080
LONDON

1221
01:24:37,119 --> 01:24:39,000
I know this won't be easy
for you, but don't worry.

1222
01:24:39,079 --> 01:24:40,040
Okay?

1223
01:24:47,039 --> 01:24:49,200
I've been thinking about...

1224
01:24:50,999 --> 01:24:54,000
you and me.

1225
01:24:54,199 --> 01:24:56,200
And I just...

1226
01:25:01,999 --> 01:25:03,040
I got you something.

1227
01:25:19,999 --> 01:25:21,000
Wow.

1228
01:25:21,119 --> 01:25:22,040
You like it?

1229
01:25:22,079 --> 01:25:23,040
I love it.

1230
01:25:23,119 --> 01:25:24,080
7 rounds.

1231
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:31,460
Okay.

1232
01:25:31,999 --> 01:25:33,080
Not yet. I'm not ready.

1233
01:25:33,119 --> 01:25:34,040
Stop, no.

1234
01:25:34,079 --> 01:25:34,960
Not right now. Wait.

1235
01:25:35,039 --> 01:25:37,000
If you don't do it, you're
gonna blow it. Look at me.

1236
01:25:37,039 --> 01:25:40,960
I'm gonna count to 3. In English.

1237
01:25:41,999 --> 01:25:43,040
Not now. No. Wait.

1238
01:25:43,119 --> 01:25:44,120
2...

1239
01:25:46,199 --> 01:25:48,040
God damn it.

1240
01:25:49,199 --> 01:25:50,160
Hi.

1241
01:26:02,039 --> 01:26:03,080
She's gonna get killed.

1242
01:26:04,079 --> 01:26:06,120
It's tough when they leave the nest.

1243
01:26:06,999 --> 01:26:08,960
Frank, come on. A little trust.

1244
01:26:08,999 --> 01:26:11,040
She has talents you and I will never have.

1245
01:26:11,999 --> 01:26:13,040
What talents?

1246
01:26:13,159 --> 01:26:14,200
People like her.

1247
01:26:16,039 --> 01:26:20,040
If she lives, this'll be
good for your relationship.

1248
01:26:20,119 --> 01:26:21,040
You're right.

1249
01:26:21,199 --> 01:26:25,080
And if there's one thing I
know, it's women and covert ops.

1250
01:26:26,039 --> 01:26:27,040
That's 2 things.

1251
01:26:29,999 --> 01:26:31,160
No, grasshopper.

1252
01:26:33,039 --> 01:26:34,120
It is not.

1253
01:26:34,999 --> 01:26:38,120
I wanna tell you a secret, Mr. Minister.

1254
01:26:43,999 --> 01:26:46,160
Is she gonna make out with this guy, too?

1255
01:26:51,159 --> 01:26:52,080
What the hell was that?

1256
01:26:52,119 --> 01:26:54,040
Blowfish poison.

1257
01:26:54,199 --> 01:26:58,000
Paralysis and shooting pains
will grip your entire body.

1258
01:26:58,119 --> 01:27:00,160
And you will slowly asphyxiate
until you choke to death...

1259
01:27:00,199 --> 01:27:03,200
while remaining fully conscious,
unless you do exactly what I say.

1260
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:14,000
I will die before I compromise my county.

1261
01:27:15,999 --> 01:27:17,160
We will drive you to your office...

1262
01:27:17,199 --> 01:27:19,360
where you will write a letter
on official stationery...

1263
01:27:19,999 --> 01:27:22,078
denouncing the treatment of women in Iran.

1264
01:27:22,079 --> 01:27:22,078
Then you will get your antidote.
Denouncing the treatment of women in Iran.

1265
01:27:22,079 --> 01:27:23,359
Then you will get your antidote.

1266
01:27:24,999 --> 01:27:25,499
That's it?

1267
01:27:29,079 --> 01:27:30,120
IRANIAN EMBASSY, LONDON

1268
01:27:36,079 --> 01:27:37,000
How may I help you?

1269
01:27:37,039 --> 01:27:39,080
I would like to defect to Iran.

1270
01:27:55,999 --> 01:27:58,160
Dr. Bailey, my apologies for the delay.

1271
01:27:59,079 --> 01:28:02,040
Professor Dombrovski has
declared the weapon authentic.

1272
01:28:02,079 --> 01:28:03,960
And we're prepared to proceed.

1273
01:28:04,039 --> 01:28:06,160
As soon as my money's
transferred, Mr. Ambassador.

1274
01:28:12,039 --> 01:28:14,000
Move! She's with me.

1275
01:28:34,119 --> 01:28:35,040
Arman?

1276
01:28:41,159 --> 01:28:42,120
He needs to go.

1277
01:28:42,199 --> 01:28:43,160
Okay, okay.

1278
01:28:44,999 --> 01:28:46,120
What are you talking about? Who is she?

1279
01:28:46,159 --> 01:28:48,960
Sir, I'm sorry, you need to leave.

1280
01:28:48,999 --> 01:28:50,000
You need to shut up!

1281
01:28:51,119 --> 01:28:52,040
No.

1282
01:28:52,079 --> 01:28:53,200
What is happening here?

1283
01:28:53,999 --> 01:28:54,800
What are you doing?

1284
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:56,640
Tell me what is happening
here! Who is she?

1285
01:28:56,999 --> 01:28:58,960
Get out! When I say "get
out", get out of here!

1286
01:28:58,999 --> 01:29:00,160
You need to go!

1287
01:29:00,999 --> 01:29:02,080
You shut the fuck up!

1288
01:29:11,159 --> 01:29:12,200
Where's the safe?

1289
01:29:12,999 --> 01:29:13,499
What?

1290
01:29:14,999 --> 01:29:16,120
Where's the safe?

1291
01:29:29,039 --> 01:29:30,040
Poo poo's coming.

1292
01:29:47,199 --> 01:29:49,040
24 Hour Plumbing.

1293
01:29:49,119 --> 01:29:51,960
Hurry. Emergency.Water
everywhere. Come quick.

1294
01:30:05,119 --> 01:30:06,960
Stop! Plumbers, wait!

1295
01:30:06,999 --> 01:30:08,160
It's okay! This way.

1296
01:30:10,199 --> 01:30:12,040
Money received.

1297
01:30:12,119 --> 01:30:13,040
Good show.

1298
01:30:14,119 --> 01:30:15,200
Let's see our friend here.

1299
01:30:20,079 --> 01:30:21,960
Would you lend me your knife, please?

1300
01:30:22,199 --> 01:30:23,120
Thank you.

1301
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:27,321
Sorry about the mess on the carpet.

1302
01:30:29,199 --> 01:30:30,120
Oh well.

1303
01:30:31,039 --> 01:30:33,960
At this point, Jack... You don't
mind me calling you "Jack", I hope.

1304
01:30:33,999 --> 01:30:37,040
You must be beginning to comprehend...

1305
01:30:37,119 --> 01:30:39,160
the stunning totality of your failure.

1306
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:43,041
You can't give it to them.

1307
01:30:43,079 --> 01:30:46,120
I've no more interest in giving
Red Mercury to these boys...

1308
01:30:46,159 --> 01:30:48,040
than I have in giving it to you.

1309
01:30:54,999 --> 01:30:55,499
Jesus.

1310
01:30:55,999 --> 01:30:59,160
Yes, it's a sad old world.
Anyway, that's only my opinion.

1311
01:30:59,199 --> 01:31:01,120
But the central point is this...

1312
01:31:01,159 --> 01:31:06,160
when men like you and
those dickheads from MI6...

1313
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:08,120
or CIA or whatever sewers you came from.

1314
01:31:08,199 --> 01:31:11,200
When you take away not only my life...

1315
01:31:12,039 --> 01:31:15,120
but the innocent lives of my
dear beloved wife Natasha...

1316
01:31:15,159 --> 01:31:17,040
and my little boy, who was only 6.

1317
01:31:17,079 --> 01:31:19,200
What can I say?

1318
01:31:21,039 --> 01:31:23,080
When you mess with me, buddy...

1319
01:31:23,999 --> 01:31:25,040
this is what you get.

1320
01:31:25,199 --> 01:31:27,040
Go to hell, old man.

1321
01:31:32,999 --> 01:31:34,120
Fare thee well, patriot.

1322
01:31:40,119 --> 01:31:41,080
Boom.

1323
01:31:43,039 --> 01:31:44,080
Now what's next?

1324
01:31:45,039 --> 01:31:46,080
Ah, Washington.

1325
01:31:58,159 --> 01:32:00,040
Baby, hey.

1326
01:32:00,079 --> 01:32:01,160
Are you okay?

1327
01:32:05,119 --> 01:32:06,120
Awesome!

1328
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:24,960
Oh shit.

1329
01:32:25,039 --> 01:32:26,000
Is that it?

1330
01:32:26,039 --> 01:32:27,080
It's counting down, Frank.

1331
01:32:27,119 --> 01:32:28,000
Shut if off.

1332
01:32:28,039 --> 01:32:31,960
Shut Yeah. With what? Acupressure?

1333
01:32:32,039 --> 01:32:32,600
I don't know.

1334
01:32:32,999 --> 01:32:35,000
Why is it my responsibility?

1335
01:32:35,039 --> 01:32:37,080
Just do something.

1336
01:32:37,159 --> 01:32:40,000
With my Mr. Chemistry set?

1337
01:32:40,999 --> 01:32:42,159
I don't know what I'm doing.

1338
01:32:42,199 --> 01:32:43,399
You want me to push a button?

1339
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:46,120
Bailey's loose and the bomb's ticking.

1340
01:32:50,999 --> 01:32:52,120
Wait. Excuse me, ma'am.

1341
01:32:52,199 --> 01:32:54,000
Hello, I have an appointment.

1342
01:32:57,079 --> 01:32:58,000
Gun!

1343
01:33:23,079 --> 01:33:24,120
Get that bomb outta here.

1344
01:33:30,039 --> 01:33:31,000
Drop it now, darling. That's right.

1345
01:33:31,079 --> 01:33:31,960
My gun!

1346
01:33:38,999 --> 01:33:40,239
Press the button. Ground floor.

1347
01:33:40,999 --> 01:33:42,080
Marvin, let's go!

1348
01:33:47,999 --> 01:33:48,960
Jolly good show.

1349
01:33:56,039 --> 01:33:56,539
Bollocks!

1350
01:34:02,039 --> 01:34:04,000
You really drive this ridiculous thing?

1351
01:34:04,159 --> 01:34:05,160
Can you shoot?

1352
01:34:11,999 --> 01:34:13,160
We need eyes, Francis.

1353
01:34:26,159 --> 01:34:28,040
Come on, Frank. 40 minutes.

1354
01:34:37,079 --> 01:34:38,120
How ya doin' back there?

1355
01:34:38,159 --> 01:34:40,040
I can't talk to you right now.

1356
01:34:43,159 --> 01:34:44,080
How is it?

1357
01:34:45,039 --> 01:34:45,960
It's fine.

1358
01:34:49,119 --> 01:34:50,080
Shit!

1359
01:34:54,079 --> 01:34:55,120
Show me something.

1360
01:35:21,079 --> 01:35:21,960
Victoria...

1361
01:35:21,999 --> 01:35:24,080
I got eyes on. Bailey's
heading for the M4.

1362
01:35:24,159 --> 01:35:25,040
Got it.

1363
01:35:27,199 --> 01:35:28,080
Got it!

1364
01:35:29,159 --> 01:35:33,080
This one should stop it and
this one should detonate it.

1365
01:35:33,119 --> 01:35:34,080
It's fifty fifty.

1366
01:35:37,079 --> 01:35:38,000
Wait!

1367
01:35:40,079 --> 01:35:41,080
That's weird.

1368
01:35:42,039 --> 01:35:43,600
Do you have any idea what you're doing?

1369
01:35:45,999 --> 01:35:46,499
Wait, wait!

1370
01:35:47,039 --> 01:35:49,120
Stop cutting wires!

1371
01:35:49,159 --> 01:35:51,080
I knew we were gonna die!

1372
01:35:53,199 --> 01:35:55,000
Ready to kill this son of a bitch?

1373
01:35:55,039 --> 01:35:56,160
Abso bloody lutely.

1374
01:35:59,119 --> 01:36:00,000
Damn it!

1375
01:36:04,999 --> 01:36:05,499
Trouble.

1376
01:36:06,119 --> 01:36:07,000
Marvin!

1377
01:36:07,079 --> 01:36:10,000
It's 2 pedals and 2 sticks.

1378
01:36:10,039 --> 01:36:11,000
Okay.

1379
01:36:46,999 --> 01:36:49,080
Damn it! We missed him.
He's going into the airport.

1380
01:36:49,119 --> 01:36:50,040
Go get him!

1381
01:36:50,159 --> 01:36:51,120
Where are you?

1382
01:36:51,199 --> 01:36:52,120
In trouble.

1383
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:55,200
Turn back! You are in restricted airspace.

1384
01:36:55,999 --> 01:36:56,200
They're gonna blow us outta the sky.

1385
01:36:56,999 --> 01:36:58,000
I wouldn't worry about that.

1386
01:36:58,039 --> 01:36:59,080
The engine's shutting down.

1387
01:36:59,119 --> 01:37:01,160
Mayday! Mayday!

1388
01:37:01,199 --> 01:37:02,120
Frank!

1389
01:37:03,199 --> 01:37:05,120
I knew we were gonna die!

1390
01:37:05,159 --> 01:37:06,040
This is your last warning!

1391
01:37:06,119 --> 01:37:09,120
Please, tell me you're not crashing
with a weapon of mass destruction.

1392
01:37:12,159 --> 01:37:14,040
No, Frank, no.

1393
01:37:19,999 --> 01:37:21,000
Oh God.

1394
01:37:33,119 --> 01:37:34,160
You okay back there?

1395
01:37:34,999 --> 01:37:38,000
It wasn't exactly a three
point landing, Frank.

1396
01:37:38,039 --> 01:37:39,040
How's the bomb doing?

1397
01:37:42,119 --> 01:37:44,000
I can't stop it.

1398
01:37:57,039 --> 01:37:58,160
We gotta get it outta here.

1399
01:38:00,079 --> 01:38:01,000
Hey!

1400
01:38:01,039 --> 01:38:03,000
Get outta the car.

1401
01:38:14,119 --> 01:38:15,120
Hello, Frank.

1402
01:38:15,999 --> 01:38:17,080
Welcome aboard.

1403
01:38:20,039 --> 01:38:21,479
Always the good soldier, aren't you?

1404
01:38:23,199 --> 01:38:24,960
Stalemate.

1405
01:38:25,119 --> 01:38:27,120
How will you take him out...

1406
01:38:27,159 --> 01:38:29,040
and not shoot her first?

1407
01:38:30,199 --> 01:38:32,160
Frank, it's okay.

1408
01:38:33,159 --> 01:38:35,960
You can shoot. It's okay.

1409
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:39,120
Put the gun down.

1410
01:38:40,159 --> 01:38:41,160
Put the gun down!

1411
01:38:43,999 --> 01:38:44,960
Drop the gun!

1412
01:38:47,999 --> 01:38:51,080
Put the gun down, Frankie.

1413
01:38:52,159 --> 01:38:53,200
Thank you.

1414
01:38:55,079 --> 01:38:56,080
Pretty smart.

1415
01:38:57,159 --> 01:39:00,040
So love does conquer all.

1416
01:39:01,119 --> 01:39:03,000
Go to your golden warrior.

1417
01:39:05,199 --> 01:39:06,200
That's a good girl.

1418
01:39:12,159 --> 01:39:13,120
Come here.

1419
01:39:13,199 --> 01:39:16,080
It's so sweet.

1420
01:39:17,199 --> 01:39:21,160
Now leave the plane.
Take Nightshade with you.

1421
01:39:23,159 --> 01:39:24,120
Bye, Frank.

1422
01:39:26,999 --> 01:39:28,040
Sweet dreams.

1423
01:39:43,199 --> 01:39:45,000
Why didn't you just shoot me?

1424
01:40:03,159 --> 01:40:04,080
What happened?

1425
01:40:04,119 --> 01:40:05,160
I couldn't disarm it.

1426
01:40:13,199 --> 01:40:15,000
Crap.

1427
01:40:16,999 --> 01:40:17,499
Marvin...

1428
01:40:18,119 --> 01:40:19,160
it's going to detonate?

1429
01:40:20,079 --> 01:40:21,000
Yeah.

1430
01:40:21,119 --> 01:40:22,160
Put your arms around me.

1431
01:40:45,039 --> 01:40:46,040
Oh...

1432
01:40:47,119 --> 01:40:49,000
I didn't see that one coming.

1433
01:41:07,159 --> 01:41:09,160
There's something you don't see evey day.

1434
01:41:14,999 --> 01:41:16,239
You put the bomb on the plane.

1435
01:41:20,079 --> 01:41:23,080
And you didn't think to mention that?

1436
01:41:23,119 --> 01:41:25,040
You blew up my plane.

1437
01:41:25,159 --> 01:41:26,040
Sorry.

1438
01:41:26,079 --> 01:41:29,160
I was wrong? So we're not even gonna die?

1439
01:41:30,039 --> 01:41:30,960
Not yet.

1440
01:41:32,119 --> 01:41:34,120
I was actually starting to like you.

1441
01:41:34,159 --> 01:41:36,080
I was even thinking about not killing you.

1442
01:41:36,119 --> 01:41:38,160
This is what happens when
you ty to save the world.

1443
01:41:38,199 --> 01:41:41,000
You can't put a price on these things.

1444
01:41:41,039 --> 01:41:45,120
You owe me 30 mil for the plane.
And 20 for not killing you.

1445
01:41:45,159 --> 01:41:48,000
You're a dead man, Moses.

1446
01:41:50,079 --> 01:41:51,040
Thanks for your help.

1447
01:41:53,039 --> 01:41:53,960
Really.

1448
01:41:56,159 --> 01:41:57,160
You think he means it?

1449
01:41:58,039 --> 01:41:59,040
Nah, he's a nice guy.

1450
01:41:59,079 --> 01:42:00,120
I mean it, Frank!

1451
01:42:00,159 --> 01:42:01,120
Alright.

1452
01:42:06,199 --> 01:42:08,080
They're going to be right as rain.

1453
01:42:10,119 --> 01:42:13,160
He made the run to emotional safety.

1454
01:42:17,999 --> 01:42:18,960
So...

1455
01:42:19,999 --> 01:42:22,040
I did hear about this job in Caracas.

1456
01:42:23,199 --> 01:42:24,960
And?

1457
01:42:38,159 --> 01:42:40,120
Don't look at me. She's your girlfriend.

1458
01:42:46,119 --> 01:42:47,040
Come on.
